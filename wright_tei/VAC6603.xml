had walked unconscious of the eflbr&#xD;

Not until the scout had touched hi&#xD;
arm was Brantly's 'reverie broken&#xD;
The officer extended  his hand  an(&#xD;
with deliberation asked:&#xD;
"Are we still friends?"&#xD;
Chris pressed  his Colonel's hand&#xD;
with fervor, and replied:&#xD;
"Who says to the contratry?"&#xD;
"Nobl fellow, I have but a word&#xD;
for you. believee mc, that. a witting&#xD;
ill or wrong I han wished nor don&#xD;
aiyotie. A mistake Cbrisrwe may al&#xD;
make. Defend this much fbr th&#xD;

Brantly -watched the efeet of hi.&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"Colonel, I'd cram  the lie back&#xD;
down any throat that would give ut&#xD;
terance to an aspersion Aifeo Brant,&#xD;

"Read this." Chils handed the&#xD;
paper which he took from. the dig-&#xD;

"'Get me home as early as you can.&#xD;

Federal.&#xD;

was called to lift the hitter and Ruger&#xD;
was placed in the carriage. The Doc-&#xD;

move slowly.&#xD;

Hal was no sooner alone than she&#xD;
rang the bell. A sleek wench entered.&#xD;
"A cup of strong coffee Molly; tell&#xD;
Prince to come here."&#xD;
The girl courtesied and retired.&#xD;
Prince the horse boy entered soon&#xD;
after.&#xD;
"How's Juliet's foot?"&#xD;
"Quite sore ma'am.but not danger&#xD;

&#xD;
Hal attired in full riding habit de-&#xD;
scanded to the yard and walked to&#xD;
the lane. The arched neck of the&#xD;
brown stallion curved grandly as he&#xD;
heard Hal's step. She patted his&#xD;
forehead, and mounted. The petted&#xD;
horse reared, pawing playfully. She&#xD;
touched his flank with a riding whip.&#xD;
Count sprang away with the leap of&#xD;
a buck.&#xD;
"You'll grind your corn before you&#xD;
get it, Count, so ho; easy now. Iead-&#xD;
way's a long jaunt."&#xD;
Hal rode towards the post office&#xD;
until out of sight of home, then-&#xD;
changed direction avoiding the public&#xD;
highways. The discomfiture of Ru-&#xD;
ger's command secured a liberal rest&#xD;
to Brantly's force until noon. Then&#xD;
the line of march was resumed in the.&#xD;
direction of General Stuart. This in-&#xD;
trepid sabreur was watching McClel-&#xD;
lan's movements, and at the same&#xD;
time diverting him from the plans of&#xD;
the Confederate Chief.&#xD;
Lee had not yet crossed the river.&#xD;
Stuart was two day's march in ad-&#xD;
vance of him. Chris Spangler fresh&#xD;
as a lark was out and away in ad-&#xD;
vance of Branty. Like a falcon, he&#xD;
was ever keen for game.&#xD;
l'he scout rarely exposed himself to&#xD;
publicc observation, and few  could&#xD;
i(lentify the man, while the souihri-&#xD;
uet, "Wolf" was fauniliar to both&#xD;
armies and the people of the occupied&#xD;
country.&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
He had lain     for  hours  in' the&#xD;
silent glen until his limbs stiffened&#xD;
with cold.&#xD;
If any of Ruger's command desired&#xD;
to join the body of Sheridan's troops,&#xD;
they must come by this route. They&#xD;
had already passed or few desired to&#xD;
re-join. Finally his ear caught the&#xD;
click of shodden hoofs on the rocky&#xD;
road. , A Federal soldier rode by.&#xD;
The scout slipped from his cover&#xD;
and ran around the hill to intercept&#xD;
the new comer.&#xD;
Cocking his carbine it was leveled&#xD;
s the Federal rounded the hill road.&#xD;
"Halt." -&#xD;
The Federal attempted  to unsling&#xD;
his gun, but the challenge assured&#xD;
him it was too late to resist.&#xD;
"Drop your hands, or I'll shoot."&#xD;
The surprised man reluctantly&#xD;
dropped his hands.&#xD;
"Dismounts"&#xD;
This, too, was mechanically  done.&#xD;
The ready carbine still rested in the&#xD;
left hand of the scout.&#xD;
"Hitch up, please, and let's confer.':&#xD;
The Federal fastened his horse and&#xD;
laid down his gun.&#xD;
"I am looking.for all the informa-&#xD;
tion possible concerning the move-&#xD;
ments of Sheridan. If you have any&#xD;
and will give it as a prisoner, so good;&#xD;
if not, I must demand it."&#xD;
"What I have concerns others. As&#xD;
for myself you have the advantage.&#xD;
You can dictate my personal condi.&#xD;
tions, but nothing  that  concerns&#xD;
duty."&#xD;
 "I would not have you willinglv'to&#xD;
abandon duty," rejoined Chris. "He's&#xD;
a lame lubber who would; but mine is&#xD;
is the face of yours. You to resist.&#xD;
mine to insist. Plain now, have you&#xD;
any dispai ches on your person?"&#xD;
"That I decline to answer."&#xD;
"My brave fellow, I am obliged to&#xD;
dictate terms. If you have papers&#xD;
&#xD;
turn them over or I must possess&#xD;
them whether or no!"&#xD;
"I'll never give them up willingly !"&#xD;
"Then unwillingly."  Chris raised&#xD;
his carbine and aimed it at the&#xD;
&#xD;
Federal's head. -&#xD;
The brave captive eyed&#xD;
without a blink.&#xD;
"Hand them out."&#xD;
"You have but one way to&#xD;
Shoot !"&#xD;
Chris dropped the gun.&#xD;
too much of a man; give&#xD;
hand."&#xD;
&#xD;
the scout&#xD;
get them,&#xD;
"You are&#xD;
me your&#xD;
&#xD;
The scout extended his hard palm1&#xD;
to the Federal. The other smiled a&#xD;
they sbook hands. They sat together.)&#xD;
Chris had lain aside his gun. Bothl&#xD;
were as calm  as if no feud divided&#xD;
their sections.                 2&#xD;
Chris drew from his haversack/'a&#xD;
liberal snack which the Federaljar-&#xD;
took of heartily, then both lit pipes.&#xD;
"Now for business," began the scout.&#xD;
The Federal nodded unconcernedly.&#xD;
"Since you decline to surrender any&#xD;
papers; are you willing to make a&#xD;
verbal statement?"&#xD;
"Depends entirely  on  what the&#xD;
statement refers to."&#xD;
"Of course to the movements of&#xD;
Sheridan," rejoined Chris.&#xD;
"I  shall not give    information&#xD;
of, any kind affecting adversely the&#xD;
plans of my commander. To save&#xD;
myself at the expense of probably&#xD;
hundreds of my comrades, would be&#xD;
cruelly craven; to save myself at the&#xD;
expense of the confidence reposed in&#xD;
me is equally cowardly. No, you&#xD;
can't get any information from me. so&#xD;
you had better decide at once what&#xD;
next."&#xD;
"Spoken like a true man. Here's&#xD;
my hand.&#xD;
Good; take your carbine at twenty&#xD;
paces. Fire at the word, 'ready, one,'&#xD;
are you agreed?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are generous beyond any&#xD;
right of mine to expect it. Your&#xD;
name please?" inquired the Federal&#xD;
rising to his feet.&#xD;
"Chris Spangler, scout of Stuart;&#xD;
and  yours?"  'lhe scout had   also&#xD;
risen, both men standing over six feet.&#xD;
"-Harry Newbold, of Fourth Indiana&#xD;
Cavalry."&#xD;
- Chris motioned Newbold to his gun.&#xD;
The two men stood back to back.&#xD;
"Count ten paces, I will do the&#xD;
same. Halt at the word. Fire at&#xD;
the right about.&#xD;
"One, rwo, three, four; ' until ten&#xD;
was deliberately tolled off.&#xD;
"Halt," both stood fast.&#xD;
"Ready, one," both carbines flashed&#xD;
together, both men fell. Chris re-&#xD;
covered to find a savage wound in his&#xD;
left thigh. The blood flowed freely.&#xD;
Drawing a heavy knife that was worn&#xD;
under his   hirt, he limped towards&#xD;
Newbol     The Federal endeavored&#xD;
to struggle to his feet but fell back&#xD;
heavily.  A red stream ran from  his&#xD;
side - ['he scout at once saw that he&#xD;
had the advantage, and tearing away&#xD;
the Federal's clothing improvised a&#xD;
rude  bandage   over the  wound to&#xD;
staunch the blood. The Federal had&#xD;
fainted.&#xD;
Chris searched his pockets and&#xD;
secured  an envelope  addressed  to&#xD;
General Sheridan, then   the  scout&#xD;
bound  up   his own limb. It was a&#xD;
evere flesh wound. The scout return-&#xD;
Ad to his horse, managed to get in the&#xD;
saddle, rode to a near farm house for&#xD;
assistance for the Federal, then con-&#xD;
finued on in search of Brantly.&#xD;
It was about nine o'clh ck when he&#xD;
'eacled the c )mmand. At once he&#xD;
surrendered  the  envelope   to his&#xD;
Colonel, then summoned Scipio to get'&#xD;
"'some grub," after which he bathed&#xD;
and doctored the swollen, stiffened&#xD;
leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
Exactly what passed throigh the&#xD;
negro's cranium  is only su rmisalie,&#xD;
as he ,at gazigl with open mothat&#xD;
the scout. The latter having handag-&#xD;

he assumed  (! a  oleoe fa' nienrb atti-&#xD;

and loud. Dismounting, the stallion&#xD;

"Lor, Mars Chris, I doan't mean a&#xD;

"What, do you refer to Scip? it's&#xD;
hard to get at your starting point?"&#xD;
"Mars Chris, you keep your eye&#xD;
well skin let me tell you; I can't say&#xD;
no more."&#xD;
The negro fearing he had already&#xD;
said too much slipped away.&#xD;
Chris quite amused fell into a deep&#xD;
sleep.&#xD;
We left Hal on hei way to the&#xD;
locality known as Dead way. Desir-&#xD;
ing to avoid the frequented roads, her&#xD;
ride was necessarily longer than by a&#xD;
direct route. About two o'clock she&#xD;
galloped into a deep defile that ran&#xD;
near a boiling stream of turbid waters&#xD;
on one side, while on the other the&#xD;
jagged boulders pointed out and every&#xD;
way their flinty bare edges. Here&#xD;
and there a stunted trunk lifted out&#xD;
of shallow soil. Every where sterility&#xD;
gloomily" prevailed. A fit habitation&#xD;
for an outlaw or a jackal. The dar-&#xD;
ing woman knew the dismal retreat&#xD;
well as she mounted to a bare hill top&#xD;
where a shallow tarn was barely freed&#xD;
of the ice of last night. Placing the&#xD;

was allowed to go to the water.&#xD;
"'Tis a sorry hour for visitors if&#xD;
charity- stays behind."&#xD;
A tall crone was seen emerging&#xD;
from  an  aperture in the hill side.&#xD;
Rags reeking with negligent poverty&#xD;
fluttered from a repulsive tawny&#xD;
form. Long gray and black hair fell&#xD;
loosely on -her skinny neck.    Jet&#xD;
black sunken eyes, bony hands of a&#xD;
forbidding color, and -a mouth fanged&#xD;
with  a few   discolored  protrusio)ns&#xD;
represented the creature who spoke.&#xD;
"It is charity to suppose that visit-&#xD;
ors are unwelcome," returned Hal,&#xD;
"judging from your temper when one&#xD;
happens along."&#xD;
"Happens along; so says      Hal&#xD;
Armour. When figs grow on bram&#xD;
ble bushes and nectar flows from ai&#xD;
cow's horn, then any happening will&#xD;
not set us a wonderin'.  Well, what's&#xD;
to do?"&#xD;
"Where's Ike?" enquired Haber -&#xD;
lently.&#xD;
"Ike said, he was to be nowhere&#xD;
until he gave me leave to say else&#xD;
wise, returned the surly crone.&#xD;
"That's not ambiguous enough for&#xD;
a lie. Can't you say if he is in the&#xD;
glen?"&#xD;
"Lies is as often worth paying' for as&#xD;
the truth. Who   knowsthat better&#xD;
nor you, Mistress Hal?"&#xD;
The woman squatted on a boulder&#xD;
and picked the fangs with a knitting&#xD;
needle.&#xD;
"Your logic is as refined as your&#xD;
cunning is greedy. I want Ike."&#xD;
'I knows that well enough, and so&#xD;
does I want him. Ef Ike is at your&#xD;
beck and call, afford his mother a&#xD;
reason for allowing it."&#xD;
"There you are." A small gold coin&#xD;
rolled at the crone's feet. "I want Ike."&#xD;

"This may find him, but it don't&#xD;
make him stir a peg. Small pay, small&#xD;
service"&#xD;
The woman seized the money and&#xD;
dodged. away   among    the  rocks.&#xD;
It was , possibly an half hour later&#xD;
when approaching foot steps caused&#xD;
Hal to look up. She was standing&#xD;
by the horse, whipping carelessly at&#xD;
her flowing skirt. The fresh arrival&#xD;
was a gaunt, cadaverous man of full&#xD;
six feet, covered in a much worn suit&#xD;
of buckskin. Red hair, and reddish&#xD;
tags of beard covered his neck and&#xD;
face. He wore heavy wagon boots&#xD;
and carried a new repeating rifle A&#xD;
coonskin cap completed his attire.&#xD;
The cap was jerked respectfully as he&#xD;
came near.&#xD;
"Ike, I. have job.for you. A good&#xD;
one as you may imagine, hence so long&#xD;
a ride."&#xD;
"Well'm, we may disagree 'bout the&#xD;
goodness of it. Looks like    taint&#xD;
op'lar if you has to look this fur to&#xD;
git somebody to tend to it."&#xD;
Ike knew the person before him and&#xD;
was cautious.&#xD;
"I do not know that your services&#xD;
have ever cost you more than so&#xD;
much 'time. If I have put you at dis-&#xD;
advantage heretofore say so, and I&#xD;
will recompense you for it."&#xD;
"Has'nt cost me so far, but kain't&#xD;
tell yet what t'will cost. Howsever,&#xD;
Mistress Hal, let's year 'bout it."&#xD;
"Ike, I can get you a place at good&#xD;
pay as sharp shooter with   Ruger.&#xD;
You'll be relieved from regular duty&#xD;
and will be free to select your ground,&#xD;
if you would like to practice on a&#xD;
rebel subject for me."&#xD;
The guizzical face of the astonished&#xD;
Ike almost upset Hal's equanimity as&#xD;
he replied.&#xD;

"Not a step; don't stir a foof."&#xD;
"Yes'm," returned Ike, "I'se yeard&#xD;

Ike was seriously earnest.&#xD;
"If you refuse, its only necessarykto&#xD;
let Stuart know, there's a bushwhacker&#xD;
in the Deadway, and what then?"&#xD;
The wretch trembled from head to&#xD;
foot.&#xD;
"I might let one of Stuart's officers&#xD;
know that Mistress Hal Armour    ."&#xD;
"Silence fbol!" sternly ordered the&#xD;
enraged woman. "Do as I expect, or&#xD;
I shall turn you over to the rebels."&#xD;
Hal mounted her horse from the&#xD;
back of the bushwhacker who had&#xD;
prostrated himself on all fours at her&#xD;
word.   She touched   the   stallion&#xD;
lightly with the whip and retraced&#xD;
her way home at a canter which was&#xD;
not slackened until arriving after&#xD;

The wounded Federal had not been&#xD;
paroled by Brantly. For this intend-&#xD;
ed omission, he felt under no pledge&#xD;
to secrecy.&#xD;
The paper was committed to a ser-&#xD;
vant with orders to look out for strag-&#xD;
glers, thus to have it forwarded.&#xD;
Brantly divined rightly that the dis-&#xD;
patch would be duplicated, as it after-&#xD;
wards proved and  resolved  to join&#xD;
Stuart in time to fight Pleasanton.&#xD;
At early dawn the Colonel was well&#xD;
on the way. The scout's wound com-&#xD;
pelled him to loll in a wagon, while&#xD;
Scipio rode close alongside on Rocket.&#xD;
The   command   moved    steadily&#xD;
at  a    walk,  the   horses  hav-&#xD;
ing    been    hard    used   for&#xD;
many days, yet by noon had made&#xD;
twenty miles.&#xD;
The extreme wintry weather drove&#xD;
all indoors who could excusably re-&#xD;
main there. None of the enemy were&#xD;
visible.&#xD;
A short h       s ordered to feed.&#xD;
.While the animals were crunching&#xD;
their corn and the men eating the&#xD;
rations captured on the (lay previous,&#xD;
a sudden roar of artillery was hear&#xD;
together with the sharp rattle of small&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
The bugle rang out "to saddle." The&#xD;
ready command spurred gaily towards&#xD;
the rising smoke.&#xD;
Stuart had camped in a field with&#xD;
his back to a thin pinery. In his&#xD;
front a road led west, at his rear two&#xD;
roads diverged enst. He had cautious-&#xD;
ly selected this spot in case of a sud-&#xD;
den attack. He could cover a retreat&#xD;
by the intervening pit, and escape&#xD;
at " either sidle of the field. His&#xD;
videttes were pushed in on the two&#xD;
roadls running east. The Federals&#xD;
gallping in .or an easy ting as they&#xD;
supposed.&#xD;
Running    six  howitzers in  the&#xD;
pinery, Stuart held both column&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.          17&#xD;
&#xD;
back under a brisk shower of grape&#xD;
Dismounting every available man he&#xD;
stretched his line to meet the vastly&#xD;
heavier force that swarmed in and&#xD;
was extending its arms still beyond.&#xD;
It was but a question of strategy&#xD;
and time. The Federals could swing&#xD;
around to the western road, then re-&#xD;
treat would he cut off and the greater&#xD;
force win the fight.&#xD;
Never had the gallant Virginianw&#xD;
been more completely invested, as he&#xD;
saw column after column plunging&#xD;
through the environing woods to cir-&#xD;
cumvent his escape, while in his front&#xD;
a force equal to his own held him in&#xD;
the pinery. Yet never floated his&#xD;
plume in jauntier trim, than when he&#xD;
rode to the six how itzers, and ordered:&#xD;
"Two guns to the left stand fast&#xD;
firing as briskly as you can. Four&#xD;
guns limber up and follow me."&#xD;
Soon four cannons were hauled t(&#xD;
the extreme opposite side of the pinery&#xD;
and a cross fire was opened on th 3&#xD;
enemy's front.&#xD;
The first idea was that reinforce-&#xD;
ments hadarrived.&#xD;
This made Tleasanton cautious.&#xD;
The next thought was to charge the&#xD;
wood where the weakest artillery fire&#xD;
was.&#xD;
This was Stuart's plan, to lose two&#xD;
guns if he must. The heavy cross fire&#xD;
forced the Federals away from one of&#xD;
the roadsTas they formed for the&#xD;
charge. The buglers stood ready for&#xD;
the retreat.&#xD;
The Federal columnsain splendid&#xD;
style prepared for the assault. As&#xD;
they moved up on the woods Stuart's&#xD;
rifles and howitzers cut themtdown&#xD;
like ripe grain _&#xD;
Still they swept forward.&#xD;
Ont reaching the two cannons, they&#xD;
raised a tantalizing, hip, hip, hura;&#xD;
then drove through the pinery.&#xD;
&#xD;
Stuart moved for the open road and&#xD;
as ready to enter it at a gallop, when&#xD;
pang shot through him&#xD;
A. cloud of rising dust, a clang of&#xD;
ishing hoofs; who were they ?&#xD;
"Ya, ya, ya," burst from the hot&#xD;
,tats of Brantly's command    as it&#xD;
ept like an avalanche through the&#xD;
mbouchure.&#xD;
"Ya, ya, ya," was echoed back from&#xD;
tauit's men.&#xD;
"Right about; gallop; charge !"&#xD;
Stuart led the van, Brantly rode&#xD;
p the flank. Ralph urged on the&#xD;
en.&#xD;
Into the wood, through the tangled&#xD;
ush. At the surprised Federals.&#xD;
The cards were turned.    The dis-&#xD;
ointed Federals   retreated  to the&#xD;
le road opposite.  Into it they&#xD;
te forced by yelling Confederates.&#xD;
ke the flanking column was met.&#xD;
wo tornadoes in collision. Horses&#xD;
rged and fell, men were thrown andl&#xD;
ugled. All of Stuart's artillery shell-&#xD;
the huddled mass, then came the&#xD;
t, the  slaughter,  the   victory.&#xD;
Feral Stuart congratulated Brantly&#xD;
to1 his timely arrival. \While the&#xD;
, officers were discussing the next&#xD;
ve on the board, Scipio was earbl -&#xD;
for a bandage to wrap around his&#xD;
ster's hurt.&#xD;
3rantly  had  a  bullet in the left&#xD;

"Bravo !" shouted the Judge as the&#xD;
glass was tossed off, Mrs. Cleapor&#xD;
smiled and bowed.&#xD;
The lady left the scout to the care&#xD;
of her husband, and soon the wound&#xD;
was freshened with profuse bathing&#xD;
and new bandages.&#xD;
"Now   for the  sup  r Virginia;"&#xD;
called the Judge th -ough the half&#xD;
open door. A hour iful tray was&#xD;
brought in, to the cot tents of which&#xD;
the scout paid hearty attention. The&#xD;
ladies retired to prepare a chamber&#xD;
for the expected wounded guest.&#xD;
"Judge you will find Brantly re-&#xD;
fractorv. T'will be hard to keep him&#xD;
to his room, and if discovered it will&#xD;
be an unfortunate affair for hinn"&#xD;
"Why more for him than me?" en-&#xD;
quired the old gentlemen.&#xD;
"I have never hesitated to give relief&#xD;
to a wounded man of either army,&#xD;
why not now?"&#xD;
"Because sir, he is known in this&#xD;
locality and closely watched. You&#xD;
have a dashing maiden here, Hal&#xD;
Armour, who is playing spy. I could&#xD;
wind the game, up ere another sun&#xD;
,ut prefer not. She is bitter against&#xD;
us,"&#xD;
Chris substituted cleverly "us" to&#xD;
shield his Colonel from an undue sus-&#xD;
picion, knowing well that he was as&#xD;
confessedly marked by the woman.&#xD;
The Judge arched his brows with&#xD;
surprise, and replied, "She is a trouble-&#xD;
some vixen; I will watch her."&#xD;
"Brantly's wound is of a compound&#xD;
nature and needs close care. Any&#xD;
severe jolting or neglect would possi-&#xD;
bly cost him the arm  if not his lift.&#xD;
He consents to rest awhile. Shall I&#xD;
bring him to-night?"&#xD;
"Assuredly," replied the Judge.&#xD;
It will be midnight, m3 dear sir,&#xD;
before we return."&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
&#xD;
I seldom throw down my reading&#xD;
until that hour. At any rate, you&#xD;
get him here as soon as you can.'&#xD;
The scout leaned on the Judge's&#xD;
arm  and   reached  his horse by the&#xD;
back stairway.&#xD;
Col Brandy was placed in an am-&#xD;
bulance. Chris joined him.   Scipio&#xD;
had made a bundle of the Colonel's&#xD;
clothing and was affectionately press-&#xD;
ing his free hand when Ralph order&#xD;
ed the vehicle ahead.  Twelve stout&#xD;
stout men   rode as an   escort and&#xD;
guard. Brantly's horse was led by&#xD;
one of the men. The drive was made&#xD;
without interruption.  The citizens&#xD;
housed from the cold night, had be-&#xD;
come familiar to the hostile tramp of&#xD;
armies. Brantly stepped out, assisted&#xD;
by Ralph.   The Judge met them at&#xD;
the door.   The wounded ofhcer was&#xD;
assigned promptly to a comfortable&#xD;
warm   chamber.   Ralph and Chris&#xD;
said goodnight, and the escort return-&#xD;
ed to camp.&#xD;
"Now, Colonel, we have dressed the&#xD;
arm. The bell cord is just in reach.&#xD;
Get some rest. I'll see you early."&#xD;

The events of our tale press one&#xD;

Brantly's enforced furlough sped yby&#xD;
with pleasant rapidity amid the (e-&#xD;

Virtue and vice are but as leaves on&#xD;

impelled those sturdy blows, or was it&#xD;

"Anything specially peculiar in the&#xD;

Brantly was steadily gazing in the&#xD;
fire. Miss Cleapor resumed her sew-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
A few moments of silence elapsed.&#xD;
lie rose and used his best hand in lift-&#xD;
ing tle front of the piano.&#xD;
"Music raised the walls of Troy, it&#xD;
may lift a fit of blues. Kindly let me&#xD;
enyy your skill."&#xD;
The lady took the seat at the instru-&#xD;
mentaas Brantly resumed the comfort-&#xD;
able arm ,hair.&#xD;
For tTenty minutes he was borne&#xD;
away with the brilliancy of a most&#xD;
artistic performance. The gentlest&#xD;
cadence as of distant silver bells was&#xD;
flowed by a fugue of mingled mar-&#xD;
tial airs and brilliant allegros.' A&#xD;
tender allemande   as succeeded -by&#xD;
a plaintive orison, then the little&#xD;
fingers thiev of' with exquisite pathos,&#xD;

Brantly was at the lady's side when&#xD;
she ceased playing. His manner had&#xD;
undergone a complete transformation.&#xD;

spread on  the  rest.  IiJclicn f e  t&#xD;

on  the  performer. The rich mezzo&#xD;

a with  faultless  excellence.  Miss&#xD;
mCleapor turned.     He  was silently&#xD;
irgazing on the figured carpet.  She&#xD;
 thought to rouse him, and  at once&#xD;
a'with  equal vigor and   taste, sang-:&#xD;
"Who treads the path of duty."&#xD;
"Your hint, dear ladv, recalls my&#xD;
remark that neither duty nor pamioyn&#xD;
led me into the present ar Sp)son&#xD;
I assert that it was to tempt fortune."&#xD;
&#xD;
"As fickle she as fate. Sometimes&#xD;
she blindly favors and as often as&#xD;
blindly casts down.  No, Colonel; it&#xD;
was not to tempt fortune."&#xD;
She was about to leave the piano.&#xD;
He requested her to remain.&#xD;
"What then? lair reader of my&#xD;
mind."&#xD;
He looked earnestly in her face.&#xD;
"I will tell you in verse. Listen."&#xD;
The suggestive song, "More light,"&#xD;
was sung to willing ears.  He heard&#xD;
and understood t hat a woman's pre-&#xD;
science divined at least a trace of his&#xD;
unspoken thoughts.   She returned to&#xD;
the needle work.     He to the con-&#xD;

It is safe to say that his look was as&#xD;
often on the face of the fair Virginian&#xD;
as upon   the story of Pleasauton's&#xD;
exploits.&#xD;

avenue as they passed. Stuart was as&#xD;
full of laugh as a man could be, but&#xD;
he didn't mind sayin good mornin.&#xD;
The banjo was a peeling all the time."&#xD;
"How close was Pleasanton behind?"&#xD;
enquired Chris.&#xD;
"He wasn't behind at all. You see,&#xD;
he'd gone by the old turnpike and&#xD;
spected to cut em off' afbre they got, to&#xD;
the brick kiln ford; youpassed that&#xD;
didn't yer?"&#xD;
Chris nodded.&#xD;
"Wa'al, ef he'd a met em there as&#xD;
they riz out of the ford Pleasanton&#xD;
would have pounded all fires (the&#xD;
farmer's evangelical license for an&#xD;
unorthodox expletive) out of Stuart."&#xD;
"Some how, I kain't tell; seems to&#xD;
me,sogers ain't much on tactics no way.&#xD;
Stuart got away, and Pleasanton rode&#xD;
back,.&#xD;
Chris smiled as he led on with the&#xD;
view of finding out more.&#xD;
"So you think soldiers ain't much&#xD;
any way.' Pleasanton is a bold fighter,&#xD;
Stuart eluded him. Stuart must be a&#xD;
soldier."&#xD;
"What I mean is, how kin a General&#xD;
be so slow as to let a banjo lover run&#xD;
round him. Ef little Mac don't do&#xD;
better, he'll follow Pope."&#xD;
"Pleasanton will keep his eyes on&#xD;
Stuart you depend, if I know the man.&#xD;
He's watching him every hour."&#xD;
"Not so! le's gone into camp they&#xD;
say, away t'oher side of the Brent road;&#xD;
my som was at home on leave yester-&#xD;
day."&#xD;
A new idea occurred to the scout.&#xD;
The young girl was on the piazza fill-&#xD;
ing the water pail that stood on a&#xD;
shelf at the door.&#xD;
"I'll get some water."&#xD;
He went to the piazza. The girl&#xD;
met him with an anxious look.&#xD;
"Go," she said. "My cousin is re-&#xD;
cruiting in the settlement and will be&#xD;
back at noon."&#xD;
&#xD;
She spoke low.&#xD;
"Why should I leave on his ac-&#xD;
count?" asked Chris.&#xD;
"Not on his, but on our account; for&#xD;
peace sake ! You'll get no good here."&#xD;
Her imploring look told him, that&#xD;
she was a friend.&#xD;
The scout carelessly loitered to the&#xD;
stable, bridled his horse and watered'&#xD;
him, then led him in front.&#xD;
Bidding his host goodbye, he said&#xD;
a pleasant word or two to the wite,&#xD;
then mounted.&#xD;
As he rode away he looked back&#xD;
and saw the girl's hand motioning him&#xD;
Godspeed.&#xD;
"I had better let Rocket loosen his&#xD;
muscles. It will not do to get up any&#xD;
to do over here unnecessarily." He&#xD;
spurred the stout horse to a full canter.&#xD;
It was well for the peace of the house&#xD;
that the scout left so soon. A heartv&#xD;
young Federal lieutenant of cavalry&#xD;
entered the house soon after, and care&#xD;
lessly asked:&#xD;
"Who's been along since I left?"&#xD;
"A scout I reckon." replied the&#xD;
father with innocent assurance of the&#xD;
fact.&#xD;
"A  scout!  Who's scout?  Where&#xD;
was he from?" eagerly followed up the&#xD;
soldier. -     I&#xD;
"Wa'al I didn't ax him perticklers.&#xD;
lie said he had been in Lee's camp&#xD;
and  I spoed no one but the right&#xD;
kind would go in Lee's camp and&#xD;
then come yer."&#xD;
"You   are aptly logical  father.&#xD;
Couldn't a scout of Lee.' "-&#xD;
The eyes .of the oldman dilated as&#xD;
if in view of a grave discovery, "have&#xD;
truthfully said, I've been in Lee's&#xD;
camp?"&#xD;
"Ya'as boy, but t',as the wayhe&#xD;
said it."&#xD;
They are generally good ventrilo.&#xD;

ddhe ask any qu tions?"&#xD;
"No; nary ia oine\ He jist let me&#xD;
talk as I cared to."&#xD;
4I expect you suite 1 his case very&#xD;
weLl. Well, you told bim."&#xD;
"I didn't told him a juthin, ceptin&#xD;
Stuart got away and Pleasanton had&#xD;
gone into camp beyan the Brent road,&#xD;
pow did I mother?"&#xD;
"Nary a word more nor less," re-&#xD;
plied the old wife positively.&#xD;
"What kind of a horse did he ride?"&#xD;
required the Federal, "I'll see if I can&#xD;
find him."&#xD;
"He was a big blood bay, small&#xD;
star in front, branded U. S. A., left&#xD;
hind foot white above the fetlock, full&#xD;
tail with a kind of morgan get up."&#xD;
The young lieutenant recognized a&#xD;
similarity to the horse, which the sup-&#xD;
posed deserter had  spirited  away&#xD;
from his guards, and thought, the mat-&#xD;
ter worth further investigation. He&#xD;
jumped on his steed, a noble gray,&#xD;
and galloped down the lane.&#xD;
"He'll ride through Deadway ou&#xD;
his road to Brent's; I'll cut hhn off&#xD;
and if I miss him. put a watch their&#xD;
while I look out as he copies out th(&#xD;
Pass. He may take the Hill roa(&#xD;
instead of the Post route."&#xD;
The young Federal dashed fleet])&#xD;
across cow  paths and byways redu&#xD;
ing the route at least two miles; thi&#xD;
added to the thundering pace of t&#xD;
gray put him in the Deadway fully&#xD;
mile ahead of Chris. The ambition&#xD;
cavalryman hesitated a moment.&#xD;
"He may have gone on. He       a m&#xD;
not. Confound it, why did not I a&#xD;
when he left?  Yes, he left ust aft&#xD;
breakfast. Of course he did."&#xD;
He plunged spurs to the gray a&#xD;
rattled over the rocky Pass.&#xD;
He approached a narrow deep ce&#xD;
where in places either hand cout&#xD;
touch the bold wet rocks that slant&#xD;
&#xD;
u1p orl hung gloomily over.  le way&#xD;
was sodden with a damp muck and a&#xD;
black o+ ze spurted at each pressure of&#xD;
the hoof, or the cautious animal escap-&#xD;
ing this would slip over a sliny rock-&#xD;
bed ,f jagged projectinons. The echo&#xD;
was ghostly as the rider slowly guided&#xD;
his horse. Emerging iromn this, he&#xD;
came to  a cavernous area indented&#xD;
v ith dark fissures and lit, by a ant&#xD;
break ahead that led to the hills.&#xD;
He had rilden but a few yards,&#xD;
when a stealthy figure glided unseen&#xD;
to the opening of one of the fissures&#xD;
and carefully exainied the rider.&#xD;
"Tain't he,' muttered the prson,&#xD;
yet unseen by the  ed(lerall.&#xD;
As the latter rose to he clearing,&#xD;
the familiar form of I e, the bush-&#xD;

through the cuts of the glen to get&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
He dropped in her palm a piece of&#xD;
silver, and was about to move on.&#xD;
"One minute," she said.    "Dis-&#xD;
mount and walk. You get on the offl&#xD;
side I'll walk on this. Ef you does'nt&#xD;
you'll beihit and never see the shooter."&#xD;
"So ho !" replied Chris. "I'm much&#xD;
obliged, but as I'n not in good trim&#xD;
for walking, hat say you for a ride?"&#xD;
"I does'nt o ject, ef you only makes&#xD;
it, as if I could'nt help it, you know,"&#xD;
replied the crone.&#xD;
"Put your shoe on mine, there, up."&#xD;
He gave her a pull and lifted her&#xD;
safely in front of him.  'i&#xD;
The crone perfbrrned the farce of a&#xD;
pretended resistance, while Chris sup.&#xD;
pressing a laugh, said gruffly, "be&#xD;
quiet you hag or I'll choke you."&#xD;
Ike was concealed in the recess of a&#xD;
rock as they rode by. His rifle lay&#xD;
on his left arm.&#xD;
"Bygumhe must grip tight when&#xD;
mudder kain't squeal; durn me, that's&#xD;
the Wolf."&#xD;
Arriving at the top of the Dead-&#xD;
way road Chris released the crone.&#xD;
am much obliged for your kind-&#xD;
be.o"d soul; I am saved a bullet may&#xD;
be."&#xD;
"Yes indeed, one's bin in waiting&#xD;
for you hard on a fortnight. You&#xD;
knows Hal Armour?"&#xD;
Chris laughed heartily.&#xD;
"I'll tell her, I rode through Dead-&#xD;
way with--"&#xD;
"Prudence Shaulon in your arms.&#xD;
Golly she'll sputter," returned the&#xD;
hag grinning. "Now, don't he in a&#xD;
hurry, my Jo," continued the woman.&#xD;
"You'se only half over the danger.&#xD;
Another chap's waiting'iid at the&#xD;
crossing. Don't ride off until you&#xD;
hear three clear whistles like a dog&#xD;
call. I'll pack the first, one after the&#xD;
other to git him on the wrong road.&#xD;
The other feller won't face you in&#xD;
daylight. Then you can ride ahead&#xD;
&#xD;
f while, t'other one's searching for you."&#xD;
"You   are a   strategist," replied&#xD;
Chris, "and why your care of me?"&#xD;
"Because I want to save you for&#xD;
Hal:  I hate the jade."&#xD;
Chris wondered what she meant as&#xD;
he saw the woman disappear out (f&#xD;
sight.&#xD;
"Ike," screamed the hag, dashing&#xD;
to his retreat; "he's tuck the Hill&#xD;
road, tell your pard to meet him&#xD;
there. You take care of yourself for&#xD;
he's the devil hisself."&#xD;
Ike ran fleetly for the fork which&#xD;
he reached in ten minutes; gave the&#xD;
information to the Federal who rode&#xD;
smartly up the Hill road, ordering&#xD;
Ike to follow.&#xD;
Chris remained where he was a&#xD;
quarter of an hour, and left when he&#xD;
heard the whistle signal, following the&#xD;
Post road which led to, the Cleapor&#xD;
house, which the hag knew he desired&#xD;
to reach.&#xD;
Riding warily and much interested&#xD;
in his adventures, he suddenly cane&#xD;
upon Ike, who believing the scout had&#xD;
taken the Hill road as his mother said,&#xD;
thought it prudent to cross over to&#xD;
the Post road and return to his den.&#xD;
The cunning bushwhacker took to&#xD;
the underbrush with rifle cocked and&#xD;
ready, in his attempt to escape.&#xD;
Chris rode on as if not observing&#xD;
him, until enough of wood growth&#xD;
intervened to confuse the aim of a&#xD;
timid shot, then he halted the skulker.&#xD;
Both rifles were raised at the chal-&#xD;
lenge.  Whei  the smoke cleared the&#xD;
iishwacker was limping slowly away.&#xD;
The scout rode after him. The wretch&#xD;
attempted to raise his rifle a second&#xD;
time but, fell dead at the next fire of&#xD;
the scout.&#xD;
Chris rifled his pockets, securing&#xD;
several paper. Took his repeating&#xD;
rifle, spurned the degraded  corpse&#xD;
with his boot and left the locality.&#xD;

&#xD;
An examination of the papers taken&#xD;
from the bushwhacker afforded the&#xD;
scout intense interest as he jogged&#xD;
along. The first was a rude diary&#xD;
much  worn and   barely   legible for&#xD;
dirt. A strangely index plicable at-&#xD;
tempt at lexigraphy. By dint of hard&#xD;
study the scout extracted a connect-&#xD;
ing idea of the record.  It ran:&#xD;
"Een the yare atetene oo an fifti-ate,&#xD;

Here ended the scrawl of the (liary&#xD;
The other scraps were memoranda&#xD;
&#xD;
k ..&#xD;
&#xD;
observations made, of parties in the&#xD;
neighborhood, who were suspected of&#xD;
sympathy with the South. One of&#xD;
these read:&#xD;
"Judg Clepr's got some rel) up&#xD;

common and sees the doctor going&#xD;

want now   Mr James Rodman, p. m.,&#xD;
then I'll be pretty well up with my&#xD;
dainty little friend. Hallo, here's a&#xD;
job"&#xD;
A neat little note fell from the back&#xD;
of the memorandumI book. It read:&#xD;
"You are right ! There is a Con-&#xD;
federate at the Judge's house. Papa&#xD;
is cautious and declines to tell me. I&#xD;
have reason to believe that it is Brant-&#xD;

list of names on his memoraih111n and&#xD;
found that the Bentham   house was&#xD;
the same out of which IHal mad  her&#xD;

"It's cold enough for more fire," re-&#xD;
marked the woman who was younger&#xD;
by twenty years and in excellent&#xD;
health.&#xD;
She rose to get a fresh log, but&#xD;
Chris anticipated her, in politely&#xD;
doing the service.&#xD;
The woman eyed him     as a phe-&#xD;
.1tinenal intrusion.&#xD;
In return for the gallantry, with a&#xD;
woman's appreciation, she rose and&#xD;
sat the coffee pot on a bed of coals.&#xD;
A pone of cornbread and the remnant&#xD;
of a roast fowl were placed to warm.&#xD;
"You're consumed by the army&#xD;
worm; are you not, Mrs Bentham?"&#xD;
"Yes; we can hold nothing these&#xD;

stranger, as if surprised at his ac-&#xD;
quaintance with her name.&#xD;
"Don't put me down in the multi-&#xD;

ing his hand from   his pocket, and&#xD;
laying a greenback on her knee.&#xD;
"It's hard enough to find the wel-&#xD;

"You're one of a few, very few,&#xD;

She placed the meal on the table&#xD;

Chris was eyeing his hostess over a&#xD;
coffee cup from which he was enjoy-&#xD;
ing a palat -able drink.&#xD;
''Jim Rodman, you mean, who was&#xD;
a justice of petty cases?"&#xD;
Chris nodded.&#xD;
"Yes; he's alive; more's the shame.&#xD;

plants to get whiskey! Don't tell me&#xD;
about Jim Rodman. I wish Stuart&#xD;
had carried him off two weeks ago."&#xD;
The indignant wife looked   with&#xD;
scrutinizing eyes to see the effect on&#xD;
the soldier.&#xD;
"The same Jim," said Chris, rising&#xD;
and coming to the fire.&#xD;
"He's a bad lot. Let's see-he&#xD;
married young, pshaw; the names get&#xD;
away."&#xD;
"Howard    Graham,, of Georgia,&#xD;
to Hal Prentiss."&#xD;
Chris was stuffing his pipe. "Pren&#xD;
tiss," thought he. "How is it changed&#xD;
from Armour?"&#xD;
As he stooped to pick up the coal&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
for his pipe, he continued, "Pity the&#xD;
young folks didn't stay together. They&#xD;
acted 'foolishly, but made it worse by&#xD;
breaking so soon.&#xD;
"Yes, the whole thing's a pity; you&#xD;
see Hal was a pretty girl.  She was&#xD;
as taking a young thing as ever was&#xD;
seen. She was at a seminary in the&#xD;
same city  where   Howard    was at&#xD;
college. They saw one another often,&#xD;
and got up a big flirtation.   Conm-&#xD;
mencement day came, Howard deliver&#xD;
ed the valedictory.  Hal presented&#xD;
the b'uet for the speaker. The col-&#xD;
lege hovYs had a big dinner.  Howard&#xD;
was full of wine. They say, wine tells&#xD;
the truth. Howardl drove Hal out.&#xD;
Told her of his love, wealth, &amp;amp;c. They&#xD;
were secretly married by Jim Rod-&#xD;
man. Howard went South next day&#xD;
after he sobered and has never re-&#xD;
turned that I know of. They say,&#xD;
he wrote, that, he had not won over&#xD;
his parents, but the belief is that he&#xD;
bribed Rodman to say the marriage&#xD;
was taiidulent."&#xD;
The good woman was full of in-&#xD;
dignatiou as she put away the supper&#xD;
things.&#xD;
"Two young fools together," re-&#xD;
marked Chris.&#xD;
"She's awful hot against South-&#xD;
erners. I've told her right here, she'd&#xD;
regret it. Hal does'nt fear old nick&#xD;
himself. She'll ride anywhere. T he&#xD;
truth is, she is stabbed with cruel de&#xD;
sertion and I feel sorry for her. But&#xD;
what can you expect? Her father was.'&#xD;
"Do now mother, let this old store&#xD;
go. Tell our friend something h~&#xD;
don't know. I    hate  mud fhiugmg&#xD;
especially at a tombstone&#xD;
"You are right father," replied th&#xD;
wife, "I'll drop the Prentisses. You&#xD;
name? You did'nt give it."&#xD;
"Christopher,"  replied  the scout&#xD;
puffing away.  "How   far dues Ro,]&#xD;
muau live now? or is he at the ol&#xD;
&#xD;
place?" enquired Chris.&#xD;
"He's at the old place. Somehow&#xD;
these dirty scamps keep in with the&#xD;
officials."&#xD;
An hour more was spent in very&#xD;
enjoyable chat, then Chris proposed to&#xD;
go.&#xD;
The pair objected, but it was a&#xD;
clear night and he must make a few&#xD;
miles more, so good night, he'd call&#xD;
again sure.&#xD;
"Christopher, Christopher. Cone&#xD;
old man, you're losing all your inter-&#xD;
est in old time affitirs. Christopher.&#xD;
Let me see. There was a Christopher&#xD;
Hoggins lived   on  the Sweet Run.&#xD;
He'd be sixty, seventy, eighty and two&#xD;
years.  T'ain't he.   There was a&#xD;
Christopher-."&#xD;
"Columbus," chimed in the hus-&#xD;
band. "Grace, you've talked me al-&#xD;
most daft. Now have you thought&#xD;
for a moment of Christopher Spang-&#xD;

'Lor Sakes! The Wolf! You are&#xD;
right. He is'nt over thirty years.&#xD;

The scout did not know, but that&#xD;
the half drunk postmaster might&#xD;
shoot. He called out:&#xD;
"Say Rodman, I've a bit of a mes-&#xD;
sage for you from Ike Shanlon; shan't&#xD;
keep you long."&#xD;
"Ike Shanlon ! Blast the brute !&#xD;
When he spots any fresh traveller he&#xD;
sends word to me that it may go by&#xD;
the mail. Half of his discoveries are&#xD;
gammon. Hold    on, I'll open in a&#xD;
minute."&#xD;
As the door opened, Chris, who had&#xD;
dismounted,. stepped in and was face&#xD;
to face with the keen eyed Rodnan&#xD;
who held a candle up to see the&#xD;
visitor's face.&#xD;
"Let's get to the fire," remarked&#xD;
Chris.&#xD;
"Build it yourself; I want to get to&#xD;
bed."&#xD;
Chris walked to .the chimney and&#xD;
with the aid of a lot of loose paper&#xD;
lying around, set a smart blaze to the&#xD;
half burnt logs.&#xD;
"Where's Ike's message," asked the&#xD;
P.e.&#xD;
"I'll keep you in expectation of it&#xD;
as long as you kept me in the cold.&#xD;
Sit cdown," said Chris laying his hand&#xD;
on the man's arm.&#xD;
The scout's build was not an invit-&#xD;
ing subject even for a soured-opponent&#xD;
to tackle. The angered  postmaster&#xD;
uttered an oath and took a chair.&#xD;
"Now for a short matter, I must&#xD;
r:de further to-night."&#xD;
"You may ride to the delectable&#xD;
reserve, called Hades, so flt' as I amu&#xD;
concerned," replied Rodman. "Out&#xD;
with the business."&#xD;
"Thanks, Rodman; I shall gladly&#xD;
make over any titles there t  you, as&#xD;
you are interested much in the do-&#xD;
main thitherwvard. Ike informed me&#xD;
only to-day, that you could tell me&#xD;

credits, fast friends."&#xD;
Lighting a segar the clownish jack&#xD;
a dandy held it daintily as he eyed&#xD;
the scout and said with tragic force:&#xD;
"On eagles' wings immortal scandals fly&#xD;
While virtue's actions are but born to die."&#xD;
"You knew    Hal Armour when a&#xD;
school girl?" asked the scout calmly.&#xD;
"I have known her since she was&#xD;
two years old, as Hal Armour Pren-&#xD;
n s.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Tell Ike he may show you -"&#xD;
He pointed an index finger defiantly&#xD;
down as he gazed in the scout's face.&#xD;
"And more. You drop this right&#xD;
where it is or your visit may be a&#xD;
cause of annoyance to another than&#xD;
me ."&#xD;
'oc got the information from Ike, by&#xD;
force, and hope I shall not have to&#xD;
get it thus from you."&#xD;
The postmaster sprang to his feet,&#xD;
but Chris pressed him to the chair&#xD;
with scarcely an effort.&#xD;
"I want the date of Hal Arnmour's&#xD;
marriage to Howard Graham. The&#xD;
avowal be made, that he wouldino.&#xD;
return to claim her, and the fact that&#xD;
you were paid to say, there was no&#xD;
legal marriage. How much you were&#xD;
paid does not concern me."&#xD;
"You want what you'll get., when&#xD;

The affectation of defiance hitherto&#xD;
made, disappeared  on   the instant.&#xD;
The P. M. lately assuming such high&#xD;
flown attitudes, wilted like a scorched&#xD;
leaf. The name of the scout was&#xD;
peculiarly familiar to the federal P.&#xD;
M.-as he conned    it over and over.&#xD;
Sobered as by magic he gazed at the&#xD;
hero of many an exploit told often&#xD;

"Colonel Spangler, I was not aware&#xD;

desire it, 1 will endorse what you seem&#xD;
accurately to know, with pleasure."&#xD;
"Kindly put that in writing."&#xD;

box and desk combination near by,&#xD;
and produced a stub of a marriage&#xD;

Pouring out a heavy drink of&#xD;
whiskey he gulped it raw and laid-&#xD;
down. While Rodman slept, Chris&#xD;
was well on his way to Judge Cleapor's&#xD;
mansion.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
PRESTO:&#xD;
&#xD;
As Col Brantly entered the break-&#xD;
fast room  on the following morning&#xD;
his eyes fell on the scout. The im-&#xD;
proved condition of the first was so&#xD;
perceptible, that a smile overspread the&#xD;
other's face as he grasped the warm&#xD;
hand of the Colonel.&#xD;
"It is worth a slug now and then to&#xD;
freshen up as you've done in a fort..&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"I am doing well,,thank you, old&#xD;
fellow!  How   did  7ou  leave the&#xD;
General, Ralph, the boys and Scip?"&#xD;
enquired Brantly sitting near Chris.&#xD;
"All are doing nicely. Ralphis&#xD;
off on leave."&#xD;
"And you?"&#xD;
"Sound as a dglar; ready for all&#xD;
the Judge's good cheer to-day." The&#xD;
scout had risen to meet the Judge,&#xD;
who laughed an assent to the antici-&#xD;
pated hospitality. The ladies entered&#xD;
greeting the famous rider, ad libiture,&#xD;
with the warmest adiniration    A&#xD;
more cheerful gathering had not been&#xD;
seen .at the home of' Judge Cleapor in&#xD;
years. ,&#xD;
After breakfast the gentlemen ad-&#xD;
journed to the billiard room to smoke&#xD;
and while an hour at the cue.&#xD;
It was eleven when Chris violated i&#xD;
the pleasant game by proposing a re-&#xD;
turn to the parlor.         g&#xD;
"Gentlemen hold me always as your y&#xD;
Fidus Achates, but I ,must hear some&#xD;
music. "He stacked his cue and left ih&#xD;
the players.&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
'&#xD;
.&#xD;
&#xD;
and made no reply.&#xD;
&#xD;
l&#xD;
&#xD;
I A&#xD;
&#xD;
Virginia Cleapor was seated as&#xD;
usual se wing.&#xD;
"Will Miss Cleapor kindly lay&#xD;
aside the useful a while, to gratfv a&#xD;
rough trooper's ear and soul with&#xD;
music?"&#xD;
"Gladly ! What shall I play?" re&#xD;
plied the lady accepting his escort tro&#xD;
the })iano.&#xD;
"What I have never realized ex-&#xD;
cept as a gem of art, "The heart bowed&#xD;
down, --&#xD;
It is for a basso, but I will forego&#xD;
the intention for the melody "&#xD;
"You . are expecting   too much.&#xD;
However, I will give you the aria if&#xD;
not the voice."&#xD;
Chris was enjoying his favorite air&#xD;
when Brantly entered.&#xD;
The game ended with the first&#xD;
notes. The eyes of both met as if&#xD;
questioning each other's thoughts.&#xD;
"Miss Cleapor's best voice is heard&#xD;
in 'Yesteryear;' " remarked Brantly&#xD;
at the conclusion of the song. "I&#xD;
had tbe pleasure of choosing pearls&#xD;
from a full repertoire."&#xD;
The beautiful Virginian turned and&#xD;
smiled, then loaned her grand soprano&#xD;
to the charming song.&#xD;
Brantly now stood at the piano.&#xD;
She looked up and pointing to a duet,&#xD;
'Holy mother," said, "try the tenor."&#xD;
He nodded; she began.&#xD;
The piece was a marvel of excellent&#xD;
inging. At its conclusion Chris ap-&#xD;
?lauded to the encore.&#xD;
"How is it you've never gratified us&#xD;
3 camp?" asked the scout.&#xD;
"It was owing to the absence of the&#xD;
aspiration !" replied Brantly with a&#xD;
implimentary bow to Virginia.&#xD;
"Then," chimed in the scout, "we&#xD;
hall not be favored soon again; as&#xD;
ou will go with me this evening."&#xD;
Brantly saw from the remark that,&#xD;
s friend had a reason for the early&#xD;
e   ttr art.  - i&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Cleapor said, "if so soon we&#xD;
must get some comforts for you both,"&#xD;
and left the room.&#xD;
"Anything   new   Chris?"  asked&#xD;
Brantly.&#xD;
"Your   whereabouts  are  known,&#xD;
we'd better get away. Leaving just&#xD;
before sunset will be in1 tune."&#xD;
"You're a wonder Ghris ! I am&#xD;
strong enough to stand a long ride."&#xD;
Hal was seated facing the road that&#xD;
ran in the direction of the Cleapor&#xD;
mansion. Dr. Prentiss had made his&#xD;
last visit and dismissed the patient.&#xD;
The old gentleman rapped at the door&#xD;
and entered.&#xD;
"What is our girl thinking of now?"&#xD;
said the Doctor, putting an arm gently&#xD;
round her.&#xD;
"Thinking how sick some one must&#xD;
be over at the Judge's."&#xD;
"That old goutish attack annoys&#xD;
him more frequent of late. The cold&#xD;
does not help it," replied the equivo-&#xD;
cating physician.&#xD;
"lHe steps about as well as ever,"&#xD;
replied  Hal. "Only   this morning&#xD;
while I was giving'Count a brush to&#xD;
to warm his coat, I met the Judge in-&#xD;
specting  fences, &amp;amp;c. Papa, he's -j&#xD;
haughty man and handsome withal."&#xD;
The Doctor was glad to let the chat&#xD;
run a new way.&#xD;
"A gentleman of the old school!&#xD;
Hal, he sets much stress on proprieties&#xD;
and is severe on points of honor."&#xD;
"His mind runs amuck with regard&#xD;
to me then ! He     never recognizes&#xD;
me.  However;    Virginia, my old&#xD;
room mate  of seminary days, is no&#xD;
better ! We   exchange the stifiV1t&#xD;
bows as we meet sometimes on the road.&#xD;
"Who's to be blamed?     Hal, d&#xD;
you suppose that rumor has not mad'e&#xD;
free wit h your indiscretions? We&#xD;
must expect the whirl wind, if we sow&#xD;
to the wind. Time's revenges ar&#xD;

"5 r&#xD;

C)')&#xD;
&#xD;
Hal hal immediately on the occur-&#xD;
rence, told her adopted father of her&#xD;
clandestine marriage  with   Howard&#xD;
Graham, but beyond that, she had&#xD;
kept her own counsel. S() that she&#xD;
was not more restive than usual under&#xD;
the probe of reproof.&#xD;
"it will be nea:-u re for measure, to&#xD;
play at thistles with the proud Cleapors!&#xD;
I shall ascertain before to-morrow who&#xD;
is the wounded rebel they are taking&#xD;
such go0od care of.'&#xD;
'Heavens, I Ia1!!" interrupted  the&#xD;
Doctor, "woublI 'iiu violate the pro-&#xD;

household is under my care.&#xD;
"Y1ou ismid a moment ago you were&#xD;

and doubly worst. The end of it I'll&#xD;
see."&#xD;
She rose and patting the Doctor's&#xD;
cheek said, "but you shall get no&#xD;
harm thereby," and left the room.&#xD;
At dark the Scout's horse was led&#xD;
around with Brantly's   The latter&#xD;
was sleek and in elegant kelter after&#xD;
a couple of weeks good rest and pro-&#xD;
vender. The Judge and Mrs Cleapor&#xD;
were enjoying the Scout's anecdotes&#xD;
on the back  porch.   Brantly  had&#xD;
purposely lingered to say farewell to&#xD;
the kind and lovely Virginia.&#xD;
"n leaving a temporary home so&#xD;
full of kindest attentions, I must&#xD;
especially thank you, Miss Cleapor,&#xD;
for affording so much pleasure to&#xD;
hours otherwise depressed."&#xD;
He held her hand.&#xD;
"The pleasure, Colonel, was recip-&#xD;
rocal. Many a dull, uneventful hour&#xD;
was passed in enjoyment of profitable&#xD;
and agreeable conversation with you."&#xD;
"Except that tilt about Fate."&#xD;
lie looked smiling at her.&#xD;
"Oh well; I charged that to a spirit&#xD;
of argument j  ;  'lconvicti n.  f'I ai&#xD;
not much deceit ved  am right."&#xD;
"You have eradicate an ugly&#xD;
crotchet of mine, I confess; namely, to&#xD;
ascertain how much I could carry that&#xD;
was odious and hateful. Now; I shall&#xD;
cast it off,and not be the willing&#xD;
Atlas of a world of burdens not self&#xD;
imposed."&#xD;
&#xD;
She looked gladly on his cheerful&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"Good-bye, sweet friend! Tw&#xD;
favors?"&#xD;
She dropped her moist eyes.&#xD;
"Your prayers I crave."&#xD;
She raised her eyes and sligiiMl&#xD;
nodded the promise.&#xD;
"And may I recall you as Virginia.&#xD;
not Miss Cleapor?"&#xD;
"It will he grateful to me alwavs,&#xD;
Colonel, that you may claim nua&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
"Us, includes Virginia.&#xD;
good bye."Agan.&#xD;
He entered on the porch and grasp.&#xD;
ing heartily the stout palm  of the&#xD;
Judge and he shapely hand of his&#xD;
wife, pressed b,th warmly and sitf)&#xD;
ped lightly to the saddle.&#xD;
The two trotted on the road smart-&#xD;
ly to the Ben tham cottage.&#xD;
"Attention"!&#xD;
The scout turned jokingly   upon&#xD;
Brantly.&#xD;
"Special order."&#xD;
Number one. Colonel Brantlywill&#xD;
ride under guide of a known friend to"&#xD;
such a point as will be indicated. He&#xD;
will on seeing the   object of hi&#xD;
visit, be governed by his own sense f&#xD;
duty. At the same time so much ticre-&#xD;
tion as belongs to a disinterested sol-&#xD;
dier will he reserved to his guide even.&#xD;
if it conflicts with Brantly's views of&#xD;
duty.&#xD;
Signed,       Chris Spangler,&#xD;
Scout of General Ptuart."&#xD;
Brantly read the mock order the&#xD;
jovial scout had put in his hand, and&#xD;
asked:&#xD;
"What means this, my dear Cap-&#xD;
tain?"&#xD;
"Thanks, Colonel, for the prono.&#xD;
tion.  Hope'to deserve it.  It meanR&#xD;
just what it says.  The reservation I&#xD;
claim  may  be all right. You are&#xD;
about to confront an old acquaintance.&#xD;
&#xD;
Iv&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SCOY'T'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Read that and keep it."&#xD;
Brantly read the stub that James&#xD;
Rodmanbad given the Scout.&#xD;
"And that."&#xD;
The scout put Ike's memwrandu ni&#xD;
book in his hand, at same time die&#xD;
ciphering in the twilight the almost&#xD;
uudiscoverable scribble.&#xD;
Brantly drew a hea v blood stoie&#xD;
ring fr on his hand and placed it on&#xD;
the scout' s.&#xD;
"Chris, you know all ! What men-&#xD;
tal torture for a Fur pa, I have&#xD;

The stout 5sdldier's tice grew pale&#xD;
as he said, "i am free ! The proofs&#xD;

He clutched the prized papers.   "I&#xD;
have had all the winter of vexed dis-&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
casterald man looked half amused at&#xD;
Somen mouth astonishment of the&#xD;
H' as she enquired, "You've run&#xD;
down, Mr. Wolf; poor thing !&#xD;
Ae's head strong like her father was&#xD;
before her. I did'nt give you any&#xD;
clue, now, did I? I would'nt play&#xD;
false to the foolish girl even if she de-&#xD;
served it."&#xD;
"No; you told me nothing. I got&#xD;
that in another way. Well, don't&#xD;
mind herloud tones I will respect her."&#xD;
"Didn't I tell you what Christopher&#xD;
it was, mother? I am sorry for the&#xD;
shrew, but when one will not be ad-&#xD;
vised, then, one must'nt blame only&#xD;
oneself."  The old man moralized as&#xD;
Chris stepped out.&#xD;
The wife was now all ears trying to&#xD;
catch the first of the approaching ex-&#xD;
citement.&#xD;
Chris whistled sharply at the bot-&#xD;
tom of the steps that led to the upper&#xD;
rooms where a lamp was burning. A&#xD;
woman's voice was heard.&#xD;
"Is that Ike?  Have you brought&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"He's here !" replied Chris, not ex-&#xD;
posing himself.&#xD;
"Bring him up," returned the voice&#xD;
inside.&#xD;
"The boys want their pay afore&#xD;
they let's him go," replied Chris.&#xD;
There it is 1"  A full purse jingled&#xD;
at his feet.&#xD;
"Remain below in case I need you&#xD;
tonThe scouthretired and told Brantly&#xD;
to enter the horse.&#xD;
The heavy step of the soldier caused&#xD;
the stairway to creak. He reached&#xD;
the top, entered the apartment re-&#xD;
spectfully, bowing, ie lait aside his&#xD;
felt hat.1s&#xD;
A plain suit of cottage furniture, a&#xD;
center table, muslin window ang.&#xD;
ings and a Confederatewunifrmhcoin-&#xD;
posed the room outfit.&#xD;
&#xD;
Hal sat at the table in a handsome&#xD;
brown riding habit. The jaunty rim-&#xD;
less bat trimmed with a feather which&#xD;
was fastened with a star, sat charm.&#xD;
ingly ort her finely poised head A&#xD;
fancy whip and a pair of gauntlets&#xD;
lay on the table.&#xD;
"It is mortifying that I was forced&#xD;
to compel an interview; you'll excuse&#xD;
the unceremonious details and oblige&#xD;
me by being seated."&#xD;
"I experienced no annoyance in&#xD;
coning hither. Apologies are out off&#xD;
place. I am madam al your service."&#xD;
Brantly took a chair.&#xD;
"It is pleasant to hear you  say so&#xD;
,much.    However,    things   have&#xD;
changed. A few hours sometimes&#xD;
work  miracles.   Hal a prisoner on&#xD;
the Brent road, and Hal to-night are&#xD;
one and the same in  sentiment, but&#xD;
under different circumstances to treat&#xD;
for terms.   You made a mistake in&#xD;
not sending me inside your lines."&#xD;
She rapped the    table  with he'&#xD;
riding whip petulently.&#xD;
"It is not the first mistake I made&#xD;
in acting as a gentleman by you. But&#xD;
as you seem to be in position to nct as&#xD;
circumstances indicate, please acquai t&#xD;
me of your desire ti see me at this&#xD;
hour and in this questionable place."&#xD;
Brantly thumbed the rounds of his&#xD;
chair indifferently.&#xD;
"Desire; it is not a d.-sire that I ex&#xD;
pect to gratify. It is a right I intend&#xD;
to assume.   Brantly! it is a right l&#xD;
shall demand, with no appeal fo u&#xD;
beyond the demand.   You   assumed&#xD;
the base prerogative of deserting me&#xD;
as one would have fled a pe t. -1&#xD;
bring you back to satisfy you, that&#xD;
you made an inexcusable blunder.''&#xD;
The lustral eyes glowed with in-&#xD;
tensest animation.&#xD;
"Why beat around the bush if the&#xD;
game is in it?  Out with it madam?&#xD;
State your wrongs, my      base guess.&#xD;

&#xD;
Prove either or both. I shall save&#xD;
you the apprehension of any appeal I&#xD;
will make for immunity. I am    all&#xD;
attelitiull.&#xD;
Hal was evidently  annoyed   with&#xD;
the imperturbable manner of Brantly.&#xD;
She felt that he was at her mercy.&#xD;
Ike and his hired crew were by an&#xD;
understanding below stairs ready to&#xD;
do her bidding      What new light&#xD;
had he, beyond the doubtful informa-&#xD;
tion which he, she  knew, doubted?&#xD;
She had the proofs. Rodman was un&#xD;
known and inaccessible.  Ike out of&#xD;
the, way.  All these thoughts flitted&#xD;
threateningly and +auutingly instead&#xD;
of with an assuring meanliing through&#xD;
her mind.&#xD;
"You challenge the issue? So be it,&#xD;
Brantly."&#xD;
Her tone softened  to its natural&#xD;
womanly key,&#xD;
"You solicited my hanc1 after ( had&#xD;
given you an opportunity to decline.&#xD;
When you pointedly asked the cause&#xD;
of my having left the ball room and&#xD;
preferred withdrawal to a more re-&#xD;
tired part of the hotel, I gave you&#xD;
good reasons for my conduct.  W hat&#xD;
was your reply?&#xD;
I'll.teach them, that my wife is not&#xD;
to be ignored in any society.&#xD;
Relying on your ability to main-&#xD;
tain the boast, I was your wife within&#xD;
an hour after.   We returned to the&#xD;
hotel. Entered the ball room afresh.&#xD;
You know the rest. Have I nothing&#xD;
to demand?"&#xD;
Brantly sat indifferent, his eyes&#xD;
resting on  the opposite wall. He&#xD;
dared not trust his utteran e, so try-&#xD;
Sing was the issue.&#xD;
Hal misunderstood his silence to be&#xD;
hesitation.&#xD;
.l     "I demand that you give me your&#xD;
eW   name legally!  It is mine.  Less I&#xD;
would not receive, no, if it were pearls&#xD;
&#xD;
trom the deepest (live of the ocean."&#xD;
"Why demand, madam, replied&#xD;
Brantly  unmoved,    what you say,&#xD;
you acquired?  i ly name, (lid you not&#xD;
obtain it, on  that cursed night?  I&#xD;
withdrew myself, not the name. if&#xD;
you are ill at ease, wear it..  Will it&#xD;
allay your troubles?! I think not."&#xD;
"TO maintain your name when de&#xD;
serted, is to add insult to ignominous&#xD;
wrong. You may go where you will.&#xD;
The ends of the earth would accept&#xD;
ably  divide us.  Only attest this, I&#xD;
am satisfied."&#xD;
She pushed a paper towards him.&#xD;
Brantly glanced at it and smiled.&#xD;
Pushing it contemptuously back, be&#xD;
replied:&#xD;
''It would seem as if you are play-&#xD;
ing a desperate game.   I1ave you&#xD;
weighed' well what you are doing a&#xD;
against your self respect, not citing law?&#xD;
Phink! W'e do that in our zeal our&#xD;

THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
40            CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
She began to show the latent fire of&#xD;
excitement.&#xD;
"You humbled me without cause.&#xD;
I shall reciprocate with this differ-&#xD;
ence, I have cause.  You sought my&#xD;
hand when I would have refused it.&#xD;
I gave it.  You flung it aside with&#xD;
contempt! I ask your signature to a&#xD;
business paper.  Do you refuse it?&#xD;
Do you dare as a man? Gentleman!&#xD;
Fie, for shame! I can quote a trav-&#xD;
esty and would have a herald shout it&#xD;
on the ways where you are best&#xD;
known.   The gentleman is dead;&#xD;
long  live the gentleman.   Think&#xD;
you, I have no reasons for demanding&#xD;
rights?"&#xD;
"None to my mind. Is it not well&#xD;
think you, 'that in our souls are&#xD;
nooks that will not open to the keys&#xD;
of speech'?  Be honest now! Are&#xD;
you right?"'&#xD;
Brantly spoke low and calm.&#xD;
"Right is so abstract a thought&#xD;
that you and I cannot discuss it. Our&#xD;
views of right are as much at variance&#xD;
as'mine would be if I entertained any&#xD;
other, than that I am basely wronged.&#xD;
Brantly that signature and nothing&#xD;
else will balance the account between&#xD;
us. Sign that paper or take the&#xD;
penalty."&#xD;
"Then," replied he firmly, "I refuse&#xD;
emphatically to sign anything."&#xD;
"So be it."&#xD;
She ,stepped to the stairway and&#xD;
blew three times shrill with the&#xD;
whistle of her whip. Waiting awhile&#xD;
she repeated the call.  No answer&#xD;
coming she ran' down the stairway&#xD;
and called:&#xD;
'4Ike, you cowardly loon; why d&#xD;
you not come'"&#xD;
Only the distant rustle of leafles&#xD;
branches on the still air.&#xD;
"He has his gold and skulks away&#xD;
like a whelp that he is."&#xD;
She re-ascended to the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am alone, but not powerless.&#xD;
Brantly do you sign or not?"&#xD;
No reply.&#xD;
Brantly slowly   produced   Ike's&#xD;
memorandum book and laid it in the&#xD;
woman's hand.&#xD;
She read. A flash of indignant&#xD;
lightnings shot from her eyes.&#xD;
He placed the stub of Rodman's&#xD;
book in her hands.&#xD;
Clutching  the   splendid  tresses&#xD;
that swept from under her hat with&#xD;
one hand, she grasp d as if for life at&#xD;
her heaving   bosom  with the other.&#xD;
It was only for a moment.&#xD;
"Betrayed by you and your hire-&#xD;
lings! I defy you all."&#xD;
She crushed the papers and forced&#xD;
them into the chimiev of the lamp.&#xD;
Brantly sprang up and extricated&#xD;
the yet uncharred documents.&#xD;
"There is nothing left but sih nee,&#xD;
You or I am one too  many   for the&#xD;
future."&#xD;
Hal had slipped to the door to cut&#xD;
off Brantly's exit.&#xD;
"By signing that paper, Brantly,&#xD;
you save yourself."&#xD;
She aimed   an ivory handled re-&#xD;
peater directly at him.&#xD;
"If t ou assent before the word&#xD;
three, I shall not fire."&#xD;
Brantly smiled at the infuriated&#xD;
woman.&#xD;
"One-two - your last chance-"&#xD;
"We don't die easy our way, Mrs.&#xD;
Hal," said Chris grasping the extend-&#xD;
ed arm.&#xD;
r"That's as pretty a little pop gun&#xD;
as I have seen since the Brent road&#xD;
escapade.  Let's keep cool and gee&#xD;
o about riding! Colonel, we'll get iO&#xD;
the river by day.     Mistress Hal,&#xD;
s Count is at the back step."&#xD;
The baffled woman yielded.   She&#xD;
y saw resistance was folly.&#xD;
"Lead the way, sir.   I aml snot&#xD;
afraid to follow."&#xD;
&#xD;
Chris led the way. She was care-&#xD;
fully helped to her seat.  A  heavy&#xD;
shawl was thrown over her, and the&#xD;
Bentham cottage was left behind.&#xD;
The scout while riding at the side&#xD;
of his beautiful prisoner, was careful&#xD;
to seethat,she met no undue exposure&#xD;
from the chilly night air.&#xD;
, Brantly now and then exchanged a&#xD;
remark respecting the route with his&#xD;
friend, otherwise the ride of nearly&#xD;
eight hours was in profound silence.&#xD;
At early day Chris ordered a halt in&#xD;
a cedar clump. He built a smart fire&#xD;
and fed the horses from provender, he&#xD;
always anticipated if it was to be had&#xD;
Requesting Hal with most respect-&#xD;
ful and kind tones to draw near the&#xD;
fire, he placed the Colonel that he&#xD;
might observe the country in one&#xD;
direction while he was able to watch&#xD;
another.  Next   was  produced the&#xD;
abundant supply of good things fur-&#xD;
nished by the Cleapors.&#xD;
The coffee was poured from a full&#xD;
canteen into two tin cups.  Sandwich-&#xD;
es, boiled eggs and a roast fowl&#xD;
formed the repast.&#xD;
"Madam," spoke Chris gallantly,&#xD;
"refresh yourself with food.  We will&#xD;
wait awhile."&#xD;
"You are kind," she replied.&#xD;
He had   not heard that natural,&#xD;
sweet voice before.&#xD;
The scout walked away giving her&#xD;
2 the amplest exercise of privilege to re-&#xD;
main or escape.  He returned after a&#xD;
half hour and was delighted  to find&#xD;
that she had part-ahen of a fair nc&#xD;
Her cheeks were bright.   Her eyes&#xD;
seemed to soften as he approached.&#xD;
"Ha, that is brave! I shall feel as&#xD;
if it was a duty to eat heartily be-&#xD;
cause you have honored the meal."&#xD;
He gathered a fair share for the&#xD;
Colonel and carried it to the soldier&#xD;
who was distant about fifty   yards&#xD;
watching for any unexpected Federals&#xD;
&#xD;
Returning, Chris in honest relish&#xD;
attacked the meal.&#xD;
Hal pohitely handed the  di~lerent&#xD;
portions, thereby creating a pleisaniter&#xD;
intercourse.&#xD;
''Mistress Hal," sal ithe scout, tear-&#xD;
ing the flesh from the leg of the roast&#xD;
fowl, "let's be friendly. WV hy not? I&#xD;
have not been the ogre you fancied&#xD;
me. Come now!     Friendship for the&#xD;
future; what say you?'&#xD;
"rA r. Spangler, if ever a lan was&#xD;
hated by woman, you have been since&#xD;
we first met. But I am wrong; you&#xD;
are doing your duty honestly, I ai&#xD;
the sport of nisfortune. I an blocked&#xD;
at my own game, and intend like a&#xD;
woman to subnit."&#xD;
'There's an honest shake, i\lrs. IHal.&#xD;
He extended a great, iron muscled&#xD;
hand. Sne took it.&#xD;
''I am you friend. Leave all to me!&#xD;
Thank you, I'll dink   the rest of&#xD;
the coflee !'  She poured the collee im&#xD;
his cup.&#xD;
"Just ('on:1a11(l m1e; we all get&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
Her voice trembled as the rears&#xD;
swelled to her eyes.&#xD;
"The uncertainty of my own social&#xD;
standing in consequence ! The con-&#xD;
tempt cast on me as a farm out,-all&#xD;
goaded me to one end. Brantly was&#xD;
the victim sought especially, although&#xD;
I had aimed a less venomed shaft at&#xD;
another of the family. He was poor&#xD;
game. I could humble no one through&#xD;
him. Failing to accomplish my pur-&#xD;
pose with the first, I aimed at the&#xD;
higher mark. He has suffered. We&#xD;
have both suffered. The end is not&#xD;
yet, Chris Spangler ! I loathed you&#xD;
yesterday, you are my confidant to-&#xD;
day. Look upon me as a woman&#xD;
driven here and yonder by a storm&#xD;
of wrathful vengance, and-know me&#xD;
hereafter as you must have known, if&#xD;
even my worst traducer spoke it, as&#xD;
(excepting my aimless blunders and&#xD;
foolish ventures) the one against&#xD;
whom a criminal aspersion does not&#xD;
hint."I&#xD;
"Friends we are Ual! Be calm!&#xD;
I have said all will come right. So&#xD;
it will. Do not refer to any of this&#xD;
again unless I ask it. I only shall, if&#xD;
to help you. But let me urge you to&#xD;
treat Brantly as a friend."&#xD;
"I shall be pleasanter."&#xD;
She turned and walked deep into the&#xD;
wooded retreat. Spangler thought, to&#xD;
weep.&#xD;
Satisfied that the movements of the&#xD;
Federals did not lie on the road they&#xD;
desired to ride, Chris started the little&#xD;
party when all were refreshed.&#xD;
At night fall he had crossed safely&#xD;
and was within the Confederate lines.&#xD;
Brantly returned at once to his com-&#xD;
mand. The scout waved a brief adieu&#xD;
and rode on with his fair charge. Ar-&#xD;
riving at the first house whichextern-&#xD;
ally wore a comfortable appearance,&#xD;
he dismounted and bluffly started his&#xD;
wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Excuse General Stuart's scout. He&#xD;
desires entertainment for a lady in&#xD;
distress, but no' longer than she can&#xD;
get to Richmond.&#xD;
Can you kindly afford her protec-'&#xD;
tion?"&#xD;
"Anything for Jeb Stuart or his!&#xD;
Tell the lady to come in."&#xD;
She was assisted from the saddle in&#xD;
which she had been many hours.&#xD;
"Good night ! I   hope you'll rest&#xD;
well."&#xD;
He shook hands with the captive&#xD;
who relinquished her bridle rein and&#xD;
entered the house. Chris rode to&#xD;
camp leading Count by the side of&#xD;
Rocket.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE ORPHAN COUSIN.&#xD;
Ralph had started on leave for lbome.&#xD;
He had written concerning the ex-&#xD;
pected visit. On the evening of the&#xD;
night he  was expected, his mother,&#xD;
Mrs St Clair, and Pearl were seated&#xD;
at the centre table occupying the&#xD;
anxious interval before his coining.&#xD;
"The train reaches Woodside at an&#xD;
inconvenient hour-nine    at  night;&#xD;
Ralph will not get home until eleven,&#xD;
even if Scip pushes the ponies."&#xD;
Pearl with an involuntary glance&#xD;
consulted the clock, but made no reply.&#xD;
Her white tapering fingers wrn lt&#xD;
deftlywat a choice design of enbroi-&#xD;
dered work. The martial representa.&#xD;
tion  was    caring  completion. A&#xD;
soldier in gray     sping a flag, the&#xD;
staff of which was I-tly shot away.&#xD;
He was hewing his way through an&#xD;
a/batis of bayonets. Underneath, a&#xD;
dis ounted cannon lay on the flank&#xD;
of a dying   horse. The rider still&#xD;
gr sped the reins, as he fell stark&#xD;
across another dead man. In fr i lt,&#xD;
the flash of howling guns; overhead&#xD;
the smoke. Behind, other horsemen&#xD;
urging foaming mouthed horses to the&#xD;
van.&#xD;

THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.          42&#xD;
&#xD;
"Almost ready, is it not dear?" en-&#xD;
quired the elder.&#xD;
"An hour more Aunt, will finish it."&#xD;
Pearl replied, raising the frame.&#xD;
"It is a model of skill and patience&#xD;
Pearl ! And so painfully true to life.&#xD;
My son is still safe !  Before we re-&#xD;
tire, or rather I should say you, let us&#xD;
return thanks."&#xD;
"I am too ready to join you, Aunt!&#xD;
Now, or when I have finished?" The&#xD;
lovely face looked up for a reply.&#xD;
"When you have finished, Pearl&#xD;
Ralph must see that complete."&#xD;
Mrs St Clair did not suspect or she&#xD;
would have seen a rich blush on her&#xD;
nikee's cheeks.&#xD;
"Howard was here to day when I&#xD;
rode over to Mr Mowbray's I believe."&#xD;
"Yes, he called. He has been at home&#xD;
a month now. He says the army being&#xD;
in winter quarters, he has sixty days&#xD;
leave."&#xD;
Pearl wrought on.&#xD;
"The clerks have an easy time! No&#xD;
danger, good pay, snug beds, abun.&#xD;
dant leave of absence, ah well ! I&#xD;
want Ralph where he is. Let all be&#xD;
selected as Fortunio in the fairy tale,&#xD;
each for his varied gifts."&#xD;
Pearl smiled as she heartily en-&#xD;
drsed her aunt's patriotic remark,&#xD;
but made no reply.&#xD;
She was equally    related to the&#xD;
soldier and the clerk.&#xD;
Mrs St Clair had slipped away to&#xD;
smooth the pillow another time, to Jay&#xD;
the counterpane   back  again !  T1&#xD;
draw the curtains just a bit e Oser, 0&#xD;
to see as only a mother can, tha&#xD;
everything was mathematically exac&#xD;
in Ralph's chamber, then to knee&#xD;
with buried head, ou the Coif ,rtabl&#xD;
stuffed chair, in which her husband&#xD;
had so often   sat, there to coinu i&#xD;
with the great Ruler of nations an&#xD;
men.&#xD;
We have an opportunity ofstud'&#xD;
&#xD;
ing Pearl's appearance as she sat with&#xD;
a finger against her cheek while her&#xD;
head rested on the closed palm of the&#xD;
white hand. Slightly above the petite;&#xD;
rounded to exquisite delicacy of figure,&#xD;
clad  in a dark brown dress with a&#xD;
plain collar esca ping the pure neck as&#xD;
a dividing line, between the sottue s&#xD;
of a snow bank and a (lark contrast of&#xD;
brown beneath it. Shell like ears, so&#xD;
coy and small, peeping out of t mass&#xD;
of brown hair that curled coquetishly&#xD;
on her neck and cheeks, in spite of&#xD;
comb and lbraided restraints. Lips&#xD;
ripe and strung with love's most ar-&#xD;
rowy shafts. Eyes; well-t were not&#xD;
safe to catch their gentle vestal light,&#xD;
unless to own the charm. Such was&#xD;
Pearl, Ralph's cousin.&#xD;
The orphaned Pearl, )affte(/( of one&#xD;
who was a mother in care and devo-&#xD;
tion. She Was neither sa( nor gay.&#xD;
Ralph would soon he at home. I icr&#xD;
every thought was of him, and yet she&#xD;
reproached herself.&#xD;
"ie is rich; I am p or. I le is&#xD;
master, I am a depen(lnt.&#xD;
She bit her lip and res unlthe&#xD;
work. It was finished.    slipped&#xD;
it, in a rustic, burr not "'e urevotsly&#xD;
prepared. Drew the corners 5111otlly&#xD;

were no impediment to the easy jump&#xD;
he made at the call, "Woodside!"&#xD;
Looking eagerly into the darkness,&#xD;
he saw a figure approaching from a&#xD;
fire that intensified the night.&#xD;
"Is dat Mars Ralph?    Lor bless&#xD;
you soul, my noung boss!  How you&#xD;
do? How duz you do?"&#xD;
A happy young slave about the age&#xD;
of the master was working Ralph's&#xD;
gauntleted hand like a pump handle.&#xD;
"I'm  first rate, Scip; first rat?.&#xD;
How is mother?"&#xD;
"She am tolerol, Mars Ralph, an&#xD;
mouty jubersome bout dis yer railroad&#xD;
gittin lef somewhar an spinting her.&#xD;
Mistress say, 'Scip, ef yer doan fotch&#xD;
Mars Ralph, what shall I do wid yer,&#xD;

"Sez I, Mistress, ef dat ar train&#xD;
comes to time like her orter, you'll&#xD;
hab Mars Ralph     yer by   twelve&#xD;
o'clock-an--"&#xD;
"Hold on, Scip!"&#xD;
Ralph saw that his favorite slave&#xD;
was about to gratify the habit of his&#xD;
race, a redundant garrulousness which&#xD;
he'd take later on the drive.&#xD;
"How is Miss Pearl?"&#xD;
"Ya, ya! I told yer so! Mars&#xD;
Ralph, dat caworten horse, an cannon&#xD;
consarn, mek outer cloth, what - look&#xD;
like skeeter bar an worsted'string, an&#xD;
gold treads an sich.  I seed Miss&#xD;
Pearl bodderin a mouty long time wid&#xD;
dat ar pictur, an I sez to Phibby:&#xD;
Gal, I say, Can't you see? Why dat&#xD;
is a soger.  Mars Ralph is a soger,&#xD;
I-~"&#xD;
"Scip, how is Miss Pearl?"&#xD;
"Enty I was gwine to tell you, boss.&#xD;
Miss Pearl!"&#xD;
The good natured slave, with the&#xD;
freedom of a humored playmate, hesi-&#xD;
tated.&#xD;
"She am, sar, purtier dan she ebber&#xD;
was afo."&#xD;
He took the bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Come on, Mars Ralph; de ponies&#xD;
is gwine to do two forty for home."&#xD;
Ralph jumped in and for practise'&#xD;
sake took the lines.&#xD;
'Old Scip, sends howdye to you."&#xD;
"Tank you sir!  I 1 as gwine to ax&#xD;
you bout daddy tomor ow, arter I git&#xD;
tru wid we own bizness.  He day wid&#xD;
Mars Leo all de time, sar?"&#xD;
"Yes," replied Ralph, "he likes&#xD;
camp life."&#xD;
"Taint much gun round day, way&#xD;
he is I spec, Mars Ralph."&#xD;
Young Scip saw a reason for his&#xD;
father's contentment.&#xD;
"They stand around in tents, stack.&#xD;
ed outside like corn ricks; men use'&#xD;
them for walking sticks.  In fact we&#xD;
don't handle .anything ele."&#xD;
"Lor a mussy! Daddy must he an-&#xD;
oder man    from  de ole time Scip.&#xD;
Lem stay day, lem stay!"&#xD;
Young Scipio (with the invariable&#xD;
peculiarity, bred upon a feeling of&#xD;
reverence and dependence to the&#xD;
master, common to all well cared fir&#xD;
slaves) would probably not have al-&#xD;
luded to his father at all.  As his&#xD;
Young master saw fit to indroduce the&#xD;
subject, he gave it a passing notice&#xD;
This was not owing to any want of&#xD;
filial regard.  On the contrary, like&#xD;
all children of well ordered slaves, he&#xD;
loved his father loyally, but it wails&#xD;
enough that an  affectionate, faithful&#xD;
master was in the land. To a good&#xD;
servant it was his quantum su ficit.&#xD;
"Yaas sar! Hebben! I'se proud for&#xD;
true dat I kin han you ober to old Miss-&#xD;
tress to-night. Dem creeters is a doing&#xD;
dere bess. Somting is a kind er clare-&#xD;

"What is that Scip?  Say it over&#xD;
again."&#xD;
Ralph lit a segar as he enjoyed the&#xD;
circumlocutory, rambling jabber.&#xD;

The negro joined in the hearty&#xD;
laugh.&#xD;
"Dot is so, sar. Now dese creeters&#xD;

"Oh stupid, shut up, or I'll make&#xD;
you walk the rest of the way.  Tell&#xD;
me, all about the good folks around&#xD;
the Oaks."&#xD;
"Well, sar, we driv ober yisterday&#xD;

but needer Mistress nor Miss Pearl&#xD;

lady, but Miss Pearl sew all de time,&#xD;
and when he goes off, den she stop&#xD;
sewing and teks a walk or rides de&#xD;
pony.   De rest ob de peeple is bout&#xD;
common, sar."&#xD;
Constant -visitor, thought Ralph.&#xD;
Who can tell but that he may   suc-&#xD;
ceed?  So the time flew by.&#xD;
The ponies wheeled into the car-&#xD;
riage drive, sped by the fish pond and&#xD;
center plo; just  as  the   "whoa"&#xD;
was uttered, Ralph sprang and folded&#xD;
his mother in his arms.&#xD;
For several seconds the sobbing&#xD;
heart of the mother beat in unison to&#xD;
the gentle patting of the son's hand&#xD;
on her shoulder.  Passing her arm&#xD;
through his, the two entered the sit-&#xD;
ting room.&#xD;
"Where's Pearl, mother?"&#xD;
"It was so late, Ralph, I asked her&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
--A.&#xD;

to go to bed. Here, she has prepared&#xD;
a nice meal for you."&#xD;
"Many thanks for her kindness.&#xD;
It is a nice meal!  Bless her little&#xD;
hands and heart!"&#xD;
Ralph relished the savory supper,&#xD;
but could not repress the thought:&#xD;
She might have waited to meet me!&#xD;
After the late supper, with his&#xD;
mother's consent, he lit a pipe.  A&#xD;
rambling conversation ran on until&#xD;
two o'clock, when a kiss was set on&#xD;
Ralph's forehead then he retired to&#xD;
rest.&#xD;
Pearl was astir early, yet hesitated&#xD;
about coming to the breakfast room&#xD;
before  the usual hour.   She had&#xD;
heard the whining (playfulness of Zell&#xD;
and Videau as theft leaped upon their&#xD;
master and bounded away ready fr a&#xD;
hunt.   She heard the lively whistle&#xD;
of an aria of which Ralph was special-&#xD;
ly fond. She knew he had traversed&#xD;
the horse lot, strolled  to the  negro&#xD;
cabins, walked around the garden.&#xD;
Since the first peep of (lay, she had&#xD;
been awake with a restless concern or&#xD;
the arrival of her cousin, which seem-&#xD;
ed to challenge the ownership o her&#xD;
heart and mind. She desired to meet&#xD;
him, yet shrank from it.&#xD;
The bell for morning devotion was&#xD;
rung.   Ralph   entered the hall as&#xD;
Pearl reached the bottom step of tn&#xD;
stairway.   Ile sprang to her and (1'&#xD;
she  could  resist him, sie was in hr&#xD;
arms and a burning kiss was on her&#xD;
lips.&#xD;
The salutation, even   front her&#xD;
favorite cousin, astonished her. h&#xD;
released his bold  gistls , an wid:&#xD;
 drawing  pale  aad   tsorri se,   v u&#xD;

if I say, I did not expect you to over-&#xD;
whelm   me.   Now I mean no harm.&#xD;
Don't be angry! You were not so&#xD;
demonstrative before."&#xD;
She let her hand remain.&#xD;
"Perhaps not!" he said sadly: "Nor&#xD;
have I been so long from home, from&#xD;
you, before. Nor did I expect to see&#xD;
such a -. Oh well, we'll not quar-&#xD;
rel little cousin.&#xD;
The prayer bell has called us."&#xD;
He escorted her in on his arm.&#xD;
Mrs. St. Clair led the worship.&#xD;
Ralph watched his mother as she&#xD;
read and prayed. To him that moth-&#xD;
er was all that a perfect being could&#xD;
attain.  Dignified, she commanded&#xD;
respect even from the humblest neigh-&#xD;
bor, who seeing her pass by, would&#xD;
say: "She's a queen among women."&#xD;
Courteous - to the   poorest slave.&#xD;
"Mistress is we mudder an ebry-&#xD;
ting," vauntingly boasted her negroes.&#xD;
Still comely even at fifty, her courtly&#xD;
brother said at a receipton given for&#xD;
the parish poor, "Sister, you surpass&#xD;
the room in your calicodress. Every-&#xD;
thing becomes you as you become&#xD;
everything."&#xD;
Mrs St. Clair desired to set an ex-&#xD;
ample to arrest ostentation, remark-&#xD;
ing: "The poor we have always; let&#xD;
us ndt parade the  lisproportione ts&#xD;
of better things we may be blessed&#xD;
with, to offend."  She was devout,&#xD;
and as a mother and a true church-&#xD;
woman, she required honor first, to be&#xD;
rendered to her Master.  'he com.&#xD;
manl and thy plr)rJeid,se he held sacred,&#xD;
"to thousands of them  that love me&#xD;
and keep mIy commniandriments"&#xD;
The sound's head bowed reverently.&#xD;
His lips re1afted "arme" when the&#xD;
SuI)pplicatlrin 4-nd r,&#xD;
"IHIotime aain1, drs moother!" h&#xD;

each  of the  ladies on   the way to&#xD;
breakfast.&#xD;
"Cousin," said  Ralph,    pushing&#xD;
away the plate, "the ponies are spoil-&#xD;
ing for exercise.  They brought the&#xD;
buggy along last night by the hit.&#xD;
Will you join me in a canter alter&#xD;
awhile?"&#xD;
Pearl hesitated  only  a moment.&#xD;
The face was whiter than was wont as&#xD;
she replied:&#xD;
"Yes, I will enjoy it, I think."&#xD;
"Good; I'll see that your saddle is&#xD;
double girthed. The fillies are frisky."&#xD;
He left to superintend the prepara-&#xD;
tion of the horses.  Pearl was ready&#xD;
in due   time.   She stood in a navy&#xD;
blue habit, with a delicate feather o&#xD;
white in her beaver, and a riding&#xD;
whip at her wrist as the horses were&#xD;
led up.    Ralph walked briskly, fol-&#xD;
lowed by the dogs. Soon they were&#xD;
in saddle and away. The ride was&#xD;
along the road that led to the Craw-&#xD;
ford's.  The  young   ladies  bowed&#xD;
very stiffly as they passed.&#xD;
"Who is the gentleman seated there?&#xD;
He is so protected by both the girls I&#xD;
don't see him."&#xD;
Pearl recognized the horse at the&#xD;
hitching rack.&#xD;
"It is Howard!" she replied.&#xD;
"Pity he did not change his outfit;&#xD;
a man who never smelt saltpetre&#xD;
should not insult a gray uniform?'&#xD;
"You are severe Ralph ! May he&#xD;
not be wanted where he is?"&#xD;
Ralph turned as if to question the&#xD;
necessity of the defence.&#xD;
"Yes, he can write the roll of the&#xD;
dead or the rolls of those to be&#xD;
numbered   with the dead.   There's&#xD;
somiCthing in that. It has to be done&#xD;
I guess. -Je'll nor, like Roderigo, iln-&#xD;

not  literally !  If  he  must needs&#xD;
damn himself (excuse the quotation&#xD;
cousin) he'll do it in a more delicate&#xD;
way than on the battle field."&#xD;
'I am sorry Ralph, that you judge&#xD;
so har hly of Howard !  He speaks so&#xD;
differently of you."&#xD;
"My pretty cousin, I am sorry that&#xD;
Howard sees fit to speak, of me at all.&#xD;
Seneca's aphorism suits him exactly&#xD;
'Tar  turpe tibi sit laudari.'  Let it&#xD;
be a disgrace to be, praised by the&#xD;
vile, &amp;amp;c. I cannot regard Howard as&#xD;
any  other than a hypocrite. I am&#xD;
sorry my blood is in his veins, so I'll&#xD;
dismiss him."&#xD;
No more was said of the Bureau&#xD;
clerk soldier. They had reached the&#xD;
river. The old mill was closed, but&#xD;
the slashing water tumbled and trick-&#xD;
led  from  the  wheel.  A. few tame&#xD;
ducks enjoyed the stream. The day&#xD;
was balmy and southern. The ponies&#xD;
had galloped off the excess of live and&#xD;
stood quiet. Pearl was enjoying the&#xD;
placid river.&#xD;
Her unloved    hand rested on the&#xD;
pommel. Ralph reached over, caught&#xD;
the hand and pressed it to his lips.&#xD;
She turned and with a sad tone&#xD;
&#xD;
I   -&#xD;
&#xD;
-'R&#xD;
I&#xD;
Sit&#xD;
''&#xD;
&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"sa1lph, I shall not ride again with&#xD;
you, unless you promise, not to repeat&#xD;
this liberty !"&#xD;
"Liberty,   Pearl !"  he  returned.&#xD;
"Do you know? if you do not, I will&#xD;
tell you, that I love you above all wo-&#xD;
men excepting my mother. Sweet cousin&#xD;
repel me not! I prayed that I might&#xD;
soon enjoy your society, am I to be)&#xD;
disappointed?"&#xD;
Pearl gasped with excitement.&#xD;
"Ralph, Ralph! this is unjust! I&#xD;
cannot hear it.. Let us ride.   What&#xD;
would aunt say?" she burst to tears.&#xD;
Ah   well !  Forgive  me Pearl; I&#xD;
shall not offend you again. Dry your&#xD;
tears. Let us ride back."&#xD;
&#xD;
The way home was resuied in a&#xD;
walk. Ralph did not heed the dogs&#xD;
as both stood at a point near a covey&#xD;
of birds in the brush. le rode on in&#xD;
silence.  Had   Howard supplanted&#xD;
him! Could Pearl love such a man?&#xD;
Such torturing thoughts flew excited-&#xD;
ly through his brain. They reached&#xD;
the avenue of oaks that led to the&#xD;
home place. All was quiet; not a&#xD;
glint of sunlight touched the drive, so&#xD;
dense was the moss and leaves even of&#xD;
late winter, that clung to the nuillion&#xD;
interlaced  arms and  sprays.  T1&#xD;
even patter of the ponies' hoos roused&#xD;
Ralph. He turned. and faced his&#xD;
cousin.&#xD;
"Pearl, can I ollend this much, (ear&#xD;
girl? I am home to love and to hope&#xD;
Your letters have been of late strange-&#xD;
ly distant.' (Al, she thought, and&#xD;
yours so full of evotion.)&#xD;

inevitable. But, how can I give you'&#xD;
up?"&#xD;
He drew up suddenly at the same&#xD;
time touching the bridle reins of her&#xD;
pony.&#xD;
"One kiss sweet Pearl, if 'tis to be&#xD;
the last."&#xD;
The sobbing girl shook her head&#xD;
sadly but firmly.&#xD;
"No, dear cousin; end the doubtful&#xD;
matter here, 'tis best; you'll find it so."&#xD;
The ride continued on in silence.&#xD;
 Mrs St Clair wondered when a&#xD;
little later she heard, "Down, Zell!&#xD;
confound the dog."&#xD;
What could have affected Ralph's&#xD;
usual fondness for the pets?&#xD;
Pearl remained all morning in her&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
Ralph wandered about the planta-&#xD;
tionttaking a very doubtful interest in&#xD;
anything.&#xD;
Had the cousins disagreed?&#xD;
Mrs St Clair did not suspect that&#xD;
her son was in love with his cousin.&#xD;
Dinner passed as usual, except that&#xD;
neither of the young people was very&#xD;
sprightly.&#xD;
"Aunt !" said Pearl, "I have not&#xD;
returned Eva Crawford's call, with&#xD;
your consent, I would like to drive&#xD;
over and see her this afternoon."&#xD;
"Certainly, child." The mother's&#xD;
eyes were directed to Ralph.&#xD;
"If you don't mind being alone&#xD;
mother until dark, I'll take PearL over."&#xD;
Ralph rang the bell, and ordered&#xD;
the buggy.&#xD;
The drive to the Crawford's was trot-&#xD;
ted inside of a half hour. Pearl and&#xD;
Ralph entered the reception room-a&#xD;
handsomely   furnished  aparten t,&#xD;
opening  on   a pretty greenhouse&#xD;
Ralph opened the inevitable picture&#xD;
album; among familiar faces there, he&#xD;
saw the photograph of IHoward. with&#xD;
the subscription,  he     umble&#xD;
se iteur."&#xD;
&#xD;
The album was closed with a snap&#xD;
and pushed aside.&#xD;
"Quick, Chloe, you stupid! The&#xD;
day is short; 'twill soon go."&#xD;
Eva Crawford was wild with ex-&#xD;
citement.   Ralph had called during&#xD;
his first day  at home.    He had&#xD;
brought Pearl along.   That meant,&#xD;
of course, that he was not very anx-&#xD;
ious to have his cousin's company ex-&#xD;
clusively. Why should he?      She's&#xD;
only passe , poor withal.&#xD;
The Crawford's counted slaves with&#xD;
the St. Clairs.&#xD;
"There; go down and say I am&#xD;
coming."&#xD;
A   grand  sweep of inspection le-&#xD;
tween two mirrors, a studied charm of'&#xD;
expression, then the fine looking Eva&#xD;
Crawford rustled to the presence of&#xD;
the visitors.&#xD;
"Captain! Oh excuse the impule&#xD;
to honor the soldier! Ralph, my old&#xD;
friend, I am cha-rmed to see you saL'&#xD;
and looking so well."&#xD;
The gushing greeting verballywa&#xD;
not more expressive than the tangible&#xD;
evidence attending it in the clasp of&#xD;
the hand.&#xD;
Miss Eva's grip would have done&#xD;
credit to a clever ball tosser.&#xD;
"You are looking as bright as in&#xD;
lang syne.   No lack of fresh air. I&#xD;
see.  That's right, Miss Eva, keep&#xD;
the color on thecheek.  You  merit&#xD;
the neat anaplest:&#xD;
'On the warm cheek of youth,&#xD;
Smiles and roses are blendiu ".'&#xD;
Pearl remained in the coservatory.&#xD;
Her eyes turned close to a calla to&#xD;
hide a laugh.  Ralph had   flattered&#xD;
Tetlow's gossamer and Lubins reg&#xD;
"There's the sweet pe-arl.  You&#xD;
dear, mean little cheat! Howd ye."&#xD;
A   smacking   kiss exploded  on)&#xD;
Pearl's ripe lips, as she cotnsented to&#xD;
be imbraced by the lively Eva.&#xD;
"The fuchsias are belling  charm-&#xD;

ingly, yes! Isn't that love tangle ex-&#xD;
quisite?  The snow   drops are just&#xD;
hurting out.  That carnation  is&#xD;
Berkny's last.  The grand duke only&#xD;
blooms when forced in winter. I&#xD;
think that perfectly gor-geous&#xD;
Eva had plucked a dainty bouquet&#xD;
and wound the stem with tinsel paper&#xD;
and silver thread. A blue ribband&#xD;
completed the nosegay.&#xD;
"You must be perfectly happy that&#xD;
Ralph is hack," remarked   Eva  to&#xD;
Pearl as they still lingered among the&#xD;
&#xD;
ti&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
plants.&#xD;
"Aunt is very    happy,"  replied&#xD;
Pearl.&#xD;
eaie's impro-ved so, hasn't he?"&#xD;
"He's looking well," replied Pearl.-&#xD;
On entering where Ralph sat, heI&#xD;
was made the recipient of the pretty&#xD;
boo q et.&#xD;
"Thanks, Miss Eva!    The winter&#xD;
has not harmed your pet: "&#xD;
No,indee-d!  I take too good care&#xD;
of all that falls under my supervision&#xD;
to neglect even a pot plant."&#xD;
The benevolent landation of sef&#xD;
sounded much like a hint. (I'll take&#xD;
good care of you.)&#xD;
Miss Carrie Crawford, a girl of six-&#xD;
teen, came in, at any rate with honest&#xD;
solid steps, if a shade hoydenish, and&#xD;
walking bluff up to Ralph, extended&#xD;
a warm   hand, with, 'howdye do,&#xD;
Mister Ralph! Glad to see you, sir,&#xD;
Howdye, Miss Pearl."&#xD;
Eyeing Eva with curious comcrn,&#xD;
the younger took a seat to be a spectat or.&#xD;
The older members of the house-&#xD;
hold entered, welcomed the soldier,&#xD;
then excused themselves.&#xD;
A whinny from one of the ponies&#xD;
roused Ralph.&#xD;
He said: "Cousin, I am  about to&#xD;
go," supposing, of course, she'd assent.&#xD;
"Tell Aunt, please, that I'll redeeni&#xD;
my debt to Eva, and  not he   home&#xD;

"At the Crawford's, and will re-&#xD;
main there until Friday."&#xD;
Mrs St. Clair saw now that trouble&#xD;
was brewing.&#xD;
"Excuse me a moment, Ralph!"&#xD;
She went to Pearl's room.&#xD;
All was as usual, in excellent&#xD;
order. A note addressed "To Aunt"&#xD;
stuck in the glass of Pearl's dressing&#xD;
bureau.&#xD;
Mrs St. Clair read it and returned&#xD;
to her son.&#xD;
"Now, Ralph, if I can assist you,&#xD;
confer freely. What can I do?"&#xD;
The mother affectionately' took his&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Explain to me, dear mother, why&#xD;
a girl of Pearl's advantages and rear-&#xD;
ing should throw herself away on a&#xD;
fellow like Howard.  She has flatly&#xD;
refused  me.   I almost wish she had&#xD;
never known the sneak."&#xD;
"Don't be over severe, Ralph. I&#xD;
have not the least idea that Pearl&#xD;
would favor Howard."&#xD;
Ralph's face brightened.&#xD;
"Are you impressed with that be-&#xD;
lief, mother?"&#xD;
-'I am," she replied.&#xD;
"I am rejoiced to bear you say so.&#xD;
Well, why do you think she refuses&#xD;
me?" he asked impatiently.&#xD;
"Suppose Ralph! that, I was penni-&#xD;
less and under the care of the kindest&#xD;
of relatives. Suppose . that for every&#xD;
attention, every act of unselfish love&#xD;
I gave back    hearty  exchanges of&#xD;
loyal devotion and sympathy. Sup-&#xD;
pose. that where I was, under the&#xD;
roof, to all purposes maternal, there&#xD;
was a suitor whose wealth placed him&#xD;
at least above rue pecuniarily; what&#xD;
would you expect of me, if I were thus&#xD;
situated, to do?"&#xD;
"Refuse the offer at once!'' re)lied1&#xD;
Ralph.&#xD;
Mrs St Clair smiled and handed&#xD;
her son the letter which she bad found.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ralph read, "What is duty dearest&#xD;
aunt and mother, when some circurm-&#xD;
stances interpose, is a terrible question&#xD;
for an inexperienced girl to decide.&#xD;
My duty, first and truthfully glad to&#xD;
render, has been to serve you as I, a&#xD;
well cared. for beneficiary may; as&#xD;
your child should. My duty always&#xD;
will be, Heaven helping, to render&#xD;
that homage that filial gratitude for&#xD;
unmerited kindnesses only can feel.&#xD;
And yet ! (the blistered paper told the&#xD;
struggle) my duty is to leave your&#xD;
home for awhile.  I cannot consent to&#xD;
remain, while my cousin Ralph is on&#xD;
furlough.  Why?   Because, he forgets&#xD;
that, I am a depend':l;t orphan ! He&#xD;
does not wait the opportunity of ob-&#xD;
taining a matrimonial equality which&#xD;
I cannot give.   My cousin is noble!&#xD;
He is as dear to me as a brother, too&#xD;
dear for me to put at any disadvan-&#xD;
tage. A little time and he will forget&#xD;
me, then I will be free to know, that&#xD;
no suspicion could be laid at my door,&#xD;
that I accepted an offer which a too&#xD;
charitable nature made to me while a&#xD;
dependent on the bounty of him who&#xD;
offered. Even the womanly appre-&#xD;
ciation of a courtship (which under&#xD;
ordinary circumstances is received as&#xD;
a compliment) fails me entirely. The&#xD;
distance between my noble cousin and&#xD;
myself increases as my poverty is&#xD;
more conspicuous. I knew it not, un-&#xD;
til he had invited me to be, what&#xD;
providence has decreed against. So&#xD;
construe my absence in all kindness&#xD;
and charity dearest aunt and mother!&#xD;
You, at least, will endorse the act, if&#xD;
regretting the time and occasion.&#xD;
Pearl."&#xD;
"What a high strung woman !" said&#xD;
Ralph, fbldimig the letter: ""She is a&#xD;
Pearl indeed of no mean price.  (w&#xD;
mother, what next?"&#xD;
"ofheis our own blood Ralph ! Full&#xD;
of right views of propriety.   You&#xD;

Ralph caught his mother's hand&#xD;
as he saw a new light where dark-&#xD;
ness had lately been.&#xD;
Immediately  after dinner on the&#xD;
next day, the ponies did good service&#xD;
again. Ralph jumped    out at the&#xD;
Crawfbrds and was met in the parlor&#xD;
by Miss Eva. Her manner was acci-&#xD;
dental.&#xD;
"I had stolen away from the girls&#xD;
Captain, to practice some neglected&#xD;
music, little dream-ing of this pleasure;&#xD;
I am so glad to see you, sit &amp;amp;0e161"1&#xD;
Ralph made himself at home.&#xD;
"I enjoyed Pearl's visit so much&#xD;
last night; we slept together. She's a&#xD;
sly little duck. Do you know, I&#xD;
couldn't get a word out of her about.-&#xD;
ah    "&#xD;
Miss Eva dropped her eyelashes&#xD;
very pensively.&#xD;
"About what Miss?" asked Ralph.&#xD;
"Fie on you    both!  You know!&#xD;
Who'd come all the way from Vir-&#xD;
ginia except to see somebody!'&#xD;
"I came all the way, but if it was&#xD;
to see anyone more interested in me&#xD;
than mother, I haven't yet found it&#xD;
out. Perhaps Miss Eva may be able&#xD;
to tell more than I know."&#xD;
Ralph rose to watch the gold fish&#xD;
in the aquarium.&#xD;
"You are both excusable.  I told&#xD;
Pearl as much last night.  Love i&#xD;
non-committal.  She laughed me ou&#xD;
of countenance because I hinted sueI&#xD;
a thing, and went so far as to sa:&#xD;
that the compliment, if any, was pai(&#xD;

Miss Eva cast a tender glance t(&#xD;

"Who? do tell. I am in for a con&#xD;

''C'onfession! That's after the act!&#xD;

Ralph was half inclned to a llirta-&#xD;

Pearl entered radiant and bright&#xD;
She met Howard     cordially, then&#xD;
walking to Ralph, said:&#xD;
"How is Aunt?"&#xD;
"Very well. She sends a message.&#xD;
May I he excused for a few moments?"&#xD;
Bowing, he retired to the adjoining&#xD;
apartment used as an ordinaire, the&#xD;
large sliding doors of which made&#xD;
both rooms private.&#xD;
"That cur is enough to sicken a&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"Ralph! Ralph!!"&#xD;
At the same moment in the next&#xD;
room, Howard had drawn quite near&#xD;
to Eva and was engaging the young&#xD;
lady's ear with delectable sentiments,&#xD;
all of which she received in good faith&#xD;
and gladly.&#xD;
"We have come to the conclusion,&#xD;

"Sweet aunt; my precious mother;&#xD;

by absenting myself. I'll explain it&#xD;
all." (She thought the note had been&#xD;
o'v erlooked.)&#xD;
"She told me Pearl, to tell vou:&#xD;
well    "&#xD;
"'Tell it Ralph, oh tell it !" eried&#xD;
the weeping cousin.&#xD;
"That you were right to decline ie&#xD;
in my own home, on my own premiss,&#xD;
but, that you might accept me else-&#xD;
where! Pearl dearest! My      sweet&#xD;
cousin, I am your inferior in worth,&#xD;
generosity, nobility, everything. Take&#xD;
me as I am, my darling Pearl, and let&#xD;
all my life say, how happy I will he."&#xD;
Her head fell on his shoulder. His&#xD;
arm encircled her. The kiss was not&#xD;
withheld; nor two, nor three ! Her&#xD;
plump little arm encircled his neck.&#xD;
They were one.&#xD;
"There; let us   ack to the pJarlor,&#xD;
and then for h ie."&#xD;
Pearl ra    up to Eva's chamber&#xD;
bathed her face and was soon hack.&#xD;
bonneted for the ride.&#xD;
"What means this Pearl?" enquired&#xD;
Miss Eva, whose frills next to Howard&#xD;
had a crumpled appearance.&#xD;
"Going so soon?"&#xD;
"Aunt desires me at home ! I'll&#xD;
make lip for this another time."&#xD;
"And you Captain, when may we&#xD;
expect you again?"&#xD;
"Possibly, said Ralph, "before 1&#xD;
leave."&#xD;
"Don't be in a hurry about leaving;&#xD;
old fel," remarked Io)ward.&#xD;
"It is not inexcusable sometimes, to&#xD;
forego the plucking of the bauble re.&#xD;
mutation at the cannon's mouth.&#xD;
For family sake, I'd better do my&#xD;
part of it lest a discount may reduce&#xD;
the average chance."&#xD;
"When do you go back?" asked&#xD;
Howard, seeming   not to notice the&#xD;
rlinpf&#xD;
"My leave is only for fifteen dlays&#xD;
replied Ralph&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Eva had gathered another ex-&#xD;
quisite hon quet, which with graceful&#xD;
aptitude she pinned on the sol(liers&#xD;
lapel. H)Vard smiled cycically as&#xD;
he took a look at the duplicateon his&#xD;
own breast.&#xD;
"The cynosure !"   Whether Eva&#xD;
referred to the nosegay or the wearer&#xD;
was an open question.&#xD;

On the way home, Pearl had asked&#xD;
leave to drive. Ralph with unusual&#xD;
care had  a strong   arm  around her&#xD;
waist to prevent her being thrown out,&#xD;
perhaps. The unfortunate     nosegay&#xD;
was immolated on the wearer's breast&#xD;
because it was sillily  between the&#xD;
young lovers.&#xD;
The fragrant pine forests seemed to&#xD;
breathe a  cadence   of  heneditive&#xD;
whisperings. So   curiously  did the&#xD;
blue birds and jays look sideways as&#xD;
the pony phaeton slowly rolled by. So&#xD;
proudly did the fillies toss their heads.&#xD;
So peacefully did the nearby mill&#xD;
stream  plash, as it telling to the flag-&#xD;
ged banks a secret. Pearl held the&#xD;
lines, and Ralph held Pearl.&#xD;
Pearl's head sometimes lay on R alph's&#xD;
breast. Ralph's heart lay at Pearl's feet&#xD;
They had forgotten everything sav&#xD;
each other.  They were Tor once and&#xD;
for years to come supremely happy.&#xD;
Reaching the ample porch at homme&#xD;
they entered arm   in ari.   M rs Si&#xD;
Clair sat in the parlor. She saw that&#xD;
all was fixed.&#xD;
The joyful pair knelt before her.&#xD;
Laying her hands tenderly on thein&#xD;
Heads, she said in a pr'ayerful V'u )~(&#xD;
"My children, I rejoice with yu&#xD;
May the youth of love never forsak&#xD;
you ! May oneness of aim and desire&#xD;
be your portion !  May long  lifeat&#xD;

short acquaintance. You require too&#xD;
much in a wife to risk all on a pretty&#xD;

Marster laughed and say: 'Sister,&#xD;
I don't think you want me to marry.&#xD;
Why should I not be as easily suited&#xD;
as other men?&#xD;

Chris filled up afresh, quite amused&#xD;
with Scip's horse zeal.&#xD;
"Arter de drive, dey git reddy for&#xD;
de ball.&#xD;
Bout ten o'clock Marster and she&#xD;
came in.    It done me good clean to&#xD;

"What is that Scip?"&#xD;
"T'was a costume ball, you know&#xD;

"Yes, Aurora is the goddess of morn-&#xD;

"Jist as de music begin, I see Mars&#xD;

.43          ,CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
wid Mars Ralph "&#xD;
The faithful slave had given Chris&#xD;
a clear outline if the eventful affair.&#xD;
He saw that Hais ideas of revenge&#xD;
bad swept her past remedy unless&#xD;
Howard was made to acknowledge the&#xD;
fmt marriage.&#xD;
Now for the clearing up, he thought,&#xD;
if such is possible.&#xD;
What ensued in Hal's childhood to&#xD;
embitter her life ! Who could better&#xD;
tell it than Brantly's sister, if it was&#xD;
to be told at all.&#xD;
A few days elapsed after the recital&#xD;
mentioned, Ralph reported for duty.&#xD;
Chris applied for leave of absence; it&#xD;
was granted.&#xD;
He called on Hal at once, and an-&#xD;
nounced the object of his visit.&#xD;
"My friend;" began he, "I have a&#xD;
favor to ask, at the same time you are&#xD;
free to reject the offer if you please."&#xD;
"It  is  only  necessary Captain&#xD;
Spangler, to state it, I shall not tax&#xD;
your patience with indecision," re-&#xD;
plied Hal frankly.&#xD;
"To give you a permit to recross&#xD;
our lines will compromise both Brant-&#xD;
ly and me beyond estimate. I pro-&#xD;
pose securing you a pleasant home&#xD;
until the war is over, then you are at&#xD;
liberty to go where you desire. My&#xD;
object is twofold. First, to have Col&#xD;
Brantly's reputation as a soldier free&#xD;
from the aspersion of releasing you&#xD;
without a trial, next to clear up the&#xD;
mystery of your sipp ed    wrongs.&#xD;
What says my littYe friend?'&#xD;
"As said before, Cap'ain i, I lave al&#xD;
in your hand".   o   w, I am   as&#xD;
sured it i thc&#xD;
"Be r-ady           .a&#xD;
bound  train. &#xD;
that you fl4&#xD;
Bentham cta&#xD;
some comfort:.'&#xD;
He handed &#xD;
&#xD;
money which she supposed she had&#xD;
given to Ike.&#xD;
Hal thanked hin, and said:&#xD;
"I will be ready."&#xD;
The train that bore Chris ,d h-&#xD;
charge away, was crowded nith fIIfr.&#xD;
loughed  soldiers.   Hal occupied a&#xD;
seat however, alone and unristurlhet ,&#xD;
spending the most of the time read.&#xD;
ing.   Such refreshment and comiforts&#xD;
as were to be hnd on the route were&#xD;
procured  and   spread  before  her.&#xD;
Seldom did the scout obtrude on her&#xD;
private thoughts, yet his eyes iested1&#xD;
upon her frequently as he sat smne&#xD;
distance behind.&#xD;
Once he advanced to inquire it she&#xD;
needed anything.&#xD;
He found a Bible in her hanus.&#xD;
Her finger rested on the verse:&#xD;
"Better is a handful with tuietness,&#xD;
than both the hands full with travail&#xD;
and vexation of spirit."&#xD;
She looked up.  A great tear tood&#xD;
in either eye.&#xD;
Chris saw for once, the glint o1 the&#xD;
brilliant, fearless eyes softened by a re-&#xD;
&#xD;
pentant thought.&#xD;
She closed the book.&#xD;
seat at her side.&#xD;
Have you been as&#xD;
this before?" enquired&#xD;
the train rumbled&#xD;

"When an infant.&#xD;

"In which part of the $tate.' I-&#xD;
luired Chris indifferently.&#xD;
l   "Near Adams' Run, in Colletoi&#xD;
- District.   This, as I understand it,&#xD;
was a summer resort.     The   winter&#xD;
was passed at the cotton plantation&#xD;
t the sea coast, or as the fimilv pi-&#xD;
rred, on a rice estate adjacent."&#xD;

"Those of the St. Clair's and my&#xD;
father's interest, of which he was de-&#xD;
prived when he abandoned the state&#xD;
and took me away."&#xD;
"Your father's name was-?"&#xD;
"Armour," replied Hal promptly.&#xD;
"Eugene  Armour.     I have a vague&#xD;
recollection of him.  So  indistinct&#xD;
however, that I can recall only a rest-&#xD;
less, handsome man, full of company&#xD;
address and humor."&#xD;
Still in the dark, thought Chris.&#xD;
She thinks herself an Armour.   She&#xD;
is a Prentiss.  Well, I shall not un-&#xD;
deceive her yet.&#xD;
"Now, to   be  candid, my    little&#xD;
friend," said Chris, "I shall go, with&#xD;
your consent, very near to the same ac-&#xD;
quaintances of your father.    You&#xD;
may rest assured though, that no com-&#xD;
promise of your feelings will be per-&#xD;
mitted by me. Should I find that the&#xD;
least. tinge of unpleasantness is likely&#xD;
to occur either way, it will he easy to&#xD;
change the direction to other parts I&#xD;
am determined to see this  misuuder-&#xD;
standing to the bottom, and afford all&#xD;
parties a chance to make amends"&#xD;
"So satisfied am I, that you  will&#xD;
fail Captain, that I rather dread th(&#xD;
re-action.  What if I am constrained&#xD;
to denounce  those who blighted m&#xD;
child life, and broke my mother'&#xD;
heart?"&#xD;
Chris touched the book on whiel&#xD;
her hand rested.&#xD;
"It suffereth long and is kind."&#xD;
"I shall try to exercise charity, hu&#xD;
do not leave me to myself!  My lip&#xD;
are aspen when the heart is stung.&#xD;
They reached the station at which&#xD;
Ralph previously debarked H&#xD;
was left  in   the   care  of   th&#xD;
station master's family. Atfl&#xD;
getting  directions from  this  fun&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
Pearl looked after the house during&#xD;
the talk.&#xD;
"By   accident,  madam;   in the&#xD;
various adventures of my calling, I&#xD;
fell upon certain matters that connect&#xD;
your family with another. The inter-&#xD;
course may or may not be acceptable,&#xD;
nor must you suppose for an instant&#xD;
that I have any object in view beyond&#xD;
assisting one to unravel a complica-&#xD;
tion, which if permitted to remain will&#xD;
be an impediment during all life to his&#xD;
welfare. With your consent, I will&#xD;
request such information as will be of&#xD;
advantage. The family of Prentiss I&#xD;
refer to. Some of them are yet alive?"&#xD;
"Captain;" replied the lady, her&#xD;
face evincing much contempt. "That&#xD;
name for over twenty years has been&#xD;
inhibited on every tongue with us.&#xD;
How much of sorrow has ensued since&#xD;
first t'was mentioned in our home is&#xD;
best held in the voiceless graves where&#xD;
innocency lies buried ! I could not&#xD;
consent to know aught of them for&#xD;
reasons you may imagine."&#xD;
"True   madam ! Let all that is&#xD;
buried so remain. Its sacredness shall&#xD;
not be disturbed ! Only for the liv-&#xD;
ing do I speak. The living are not&#xD;
exempt now, but may be hereafter&#xD;
from the errors of the dead."&#xD;
"to whom do you refer?"&#xD;
"To my best of friends, Leo Brant-&#xD;
ly.  I wish to aid him."&#xD;
"Speak on Captain," continued the&#xD;
lady, "but excuse any expression o&#xD;
abhorrence I may evince for a dis&#xD;
graced name."&#xD;
"Who was Eugene Armour Pren&#xD;
Liss?" enquired Chris respectfully.&#xD;
"Relying   on  your friendship fo&#xD;
my brother Leo, I will give you th&#xD;
history of this man-the Iliad of ou&#xD;
woes.   Before my marriage, Mr Clif&#xD;
ford St Clair, afterwards my husband&#xD;
and Ralph's father, once on his return&#xD;
from  college  brought with    him&#xD;
&#xD;
chum.   Eugene Prentiss was a show ,&#xD;
wealthy, young Marylander about the&#xD;
same age as his friend. It will hr&#xD;
necessary to the proper explanation t'&#xD;
later events, that a few details he&#xD;
mentioned in explanation of our con.&#xD;
fidence and his baseness."&#xD;
"The steamers for our landing were&#xD;
weekly, and it was necessary that we&#xD;
should make the trip by boat fronm&#xD;
Charleston as the day of departure to&#xD;
the plantation did not suit the steamer.&#xD;
Our family boat was large and fast.&#xD;
Eight fine fellows sat on the henches&#xD;
The day was glorious. Clifford, his&#xD;
chum and I sat under the awning (I har&#xD;
finished a seminary course in Charles-&#xD;
ton and was returning home under&#xD;
Clifford's care). Crossing the Ashley&#xD;
for the cut, the view of the city was&#xD;
lovely.' Venice in her golden splendor&#xD;
could not excel the sight of vine-chad&#xD;
gables, trellised balconies, and flower-&#xD;
decked walls. St Michael's stood out&#xD;
symmetrical and white with its flash-&#xD;
ing batelike a jewel in the sun. South&#xD;
battery gardens were rich in April&#xD;
green. The lively harbor and shim-&#xD;
merigw aters added   to the scene.&#xD;
Eugene Prentiss was charmed, and&#xD;
 extolled everything  extravagantly.&#xD;
As we entered the cut, the boat was&#xD;
skir the ebb tid the marsh edge to avoid&#xD;
seemed toe force. The singing gieen&#xD;

THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
60             CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
argument too conclusive in favor of&#xD;
the match.&#xD;
Alice consented.&#xD;
They were engaged only four days,&#xD;
when he told her he must return home,&#xD;
and urged a secret marriage, to be&#xD;
ratified later with his parent's ap-&#xD;
proval.&#xD;
Poor thing, she yielded.&#xD;
Here is the proof of the wed-ling:&#xD;
Mrs St. Clair touched a plain ring&#xD;
on her hand.&#xD;
"He abandoned her. Alice gave birth&#xD;
to a girl, a comely infant, and left it to&#xD;
jgr parents as she sank to the grave."&#xD;
"You have no doubt, madalm, as to&#xD;
the sacredness of the marriage?" en-&#xD;
quireQ sthe scout.,&#xD;
"None -2.t all!  I have since con-&#xD;
versed  with the minister who per-&#xD;
formed the ceremony.&#xD;
Within two years the child was&#xD;
abducted, and has never been heard&#xD;
of since. Eugene Prentiss n(ow enters&#xD;
on a new role.   He renounces the&#xD;
name of Prentiss and assumes that of&#xD;
Eugene Armour. E. A rmnour Fren-&#xD;
tiss was the correct name.&#xD;
Eugene   Armour, still handsome&#xD;
as unprincipled, endeavors to ac-&#xD;
quire a competency by villainy, his&#xD;
father having cut off his entail.&#xD;
He makes the acquaintance of my&#xD;
younger sister whohad never met hiln&#xD;
before, at school in Baltimore. After&#xD;
months of persistent attention, with&#xD;
his usual persuasive powers, he marries&#xD;
her as Eugene   Armour.    Imagine&#xD;
our disgust when the base husband of&#xD;
the late deserted Alice Roften, through&#xD;
an attorney, (for l1e ared not bring&#xD;
his wife to our home) demanded   in&#xD;
the name of E. A. Prentiss his dead&#xD;
wife's estate.&#xD;
The poor thing lived little longer&#xD;
than  the first wife, scarcely three&#xD;
years. She had learned his deception&#xD;
&#xD;
and past history and pined away iln&#xD;
solitude. She was the mother of two&#xD;
children-a boy and a girl.  These I&#xD;
learned were knowc n oily by the as&#xD;
sumed name.&#xD;
'rhe girl is our sweet Pearl, whtnrl&#xD;
you saw this morning. The boy was&#xD;
taken by the father. I have never&#xD;
heard of the child since.&#xD;
Prentiss soon  gambled   away his&#xD;
wife's property and took to questioin-&#xD;
able pursuits.  He was killed in a&#xD;
duel with a lawyer named Cleapor&#xD;
about 1847.   The cause, a gambler's&#xD;
trick while playing with gentlemen.&#xD;
Such is the history of him whose&#xD;
memory we detest."&#xD;
"Madam," said Chris, "the revela-&#xD;
tion you make confirms several points&#xD;
of my investigation.   The   lawyer,&#xD;
Mr Cleapor, has very recently enter-&#xD;
tained your brother.  He  is Judge&#xD;
Cleapor-is living just on the Poto-&#xD;
mac border.&#xD;
So  the pretty  Pearl is Prentiss's&#xD;
child! Is Pearl in?" he asked.&#xD;
"I shall see."&#xD;
Mrs St. Clair arose and soon after&#xD;
returned.&#xD;
"She is out at the greenhouse. May&#xD;
I call her?"M&#xD;
"No, madam, please!   Now for my&#xD;
Pa  of the story.    Hal Prentiss,&#xD;
Pearl's sister, is at the station.  She&#xD;
is depressed and in trouble. Brantly&#xD;
and I have her in custody because of&#xD;
violating military rules. Of course,&#xD;
she inherited her father's side of the&#xD;
question. May I put her under your&#xD;
care?'&#xD;
Mrs. St. Clair sat stupified  with&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
"Yes! I'll do all T can for her."&#xD;
"Will ''ou withhol the fact fr m&#xD;
her  unti  the  propermiearrives,&#xD;
that she is Pearl's sister?  Do I ask&#xD;
too mc h?s           - (    I yu r&#xD;
"Of col rse, I shall doa   o  e&#xD;
&#xD;
The anticipation of having a com&#xD;
panion was quite gratifying to lPearl&#xD;
She asked:&#xD;
"When will she arrive?"&#xD;
"To-night," replied the aunt.&#xD;
Thus Pearl in utter ignorance of&#xD;
the relationship waited the coning o&#xD;
the stranger lady.&#xD;
Hal sat alone after the departure o&#xD;
the scout.  A torrent of though t&#xD;
&#xD;
quest," replied the lady.&#xD;
"Will you refrain from alluding to&#xD;
the cause of her arrest, unless she&#xD;
opens the way?"&#xD;
"As you desire "&#xD;
4 yamtoo happy, my dear friend,"&#xD;
said  Chris.  "I shall go and rally&#xD;
Pearl a little, then return to my&#xD;
charge.   She will   be with you to-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
The scout entered   the greenhouse&#xD;
laughing.   He   felt as  though he&#xD;
knew Pearl for years. Teasingly he&#xD;
recited the ditty:&#xD;
"which eyes most win at evening&#xD;
And which most dazzle in the hall?&#xD;
And which bespeak the lively heart,&#xD;
And which will force the sulden start?&#xD;
Or which the long life flames betray.&#xD;
Or which are brightest night or day?'&#xD;
"Ralph would say yours. There,&#xD;
peace! I shall not say another word."&#xD;
He gave his hand. Pearl smiled&#xD;
as he said:&#xD;
"You'll see me again this evening."&#xD;
Mrs St Clair  prepared   Pearl Ir&#xD;
the visit after this manner:&#xD;
"A lady, who on account of the&#xD;
war has had much annoyance, is in&#xD;
the care and under the direction fo1&#xD;
the present of your uncle and his&#xD;
friend, Capt. Spangler.  I have con-&#xD;
sented to receive her as a guest. We&#xD;
must be careful, dear Pearl, to avoid&#xD;
any reference to her private history,&#xD;
except as she may invite it.  Should&#xD;
you find her agreeable, you may, i&#xD;
you prefer, take her in  your  c1am-&#xD;
ber."&#xD;
&#xD;
J&#xD;
&#xD;
f            .,&#xD;
&#xD;
threatened her mind, but with a hero-&#xD;
ism worthy of a Joan Iachette, she&#xD;
cast some thoughts aside, examined&#xD;
others, meditated on some, or repudi-&#xD;
ated others, evincing a superb poise of&#xD;
command by which the citadel of self&#xD;
was hers, if rudely stormed  by con-&#xD;
fliting outside circumstances.&#xD;
V hat means all this tacit assent I&#xD;
an giving   to the course of events,&#xD;
since the memorable night at the llen-&#xD;
thami cottage?   Why are the waters&#xD;
of Mara so lately bitter, sweetening to&#xD;
the lip of humility?  h1ad  Brantly&#xD;
lay stark before me, (innocent as he&#xD;
was) the wrongs of my mother would&#xD;
have enabled me once. calmly to have&#xD;
said, tis best.  Could I have driven a&#xD;
bullet through [she omitted the nanel&#xD;

She pressed her temples as if in&#xD;

"All is changed.   I In dd Brantly&#xD;
no ill will. N ay, I feel, y"es, I regret&#xD;
much, all! The other, has he not be-&#xD;

Why an enigma? Have I no record&#xD;

Am I as Erasmus wrote of another,&#xD;
cursed if I am, and cursed if I am&#xD;

So went and came the filtered&#xD;
thoughts all night.&#xD;
She was sitting next day at the&#xD;
window and saw the tall scout gallop-&#xD;
ing up.&#xD;
He holds his head up cheerfully,&#xD;
she thought.  Yes, but he is as un-&#xD;
readable as a Sphynx.  He may be&#xD;
on a fruitless search.  She heard his&#xD;
tramp down stairs, on the stairway;&#xD;
his rap at the door.&#xD;
"Come in," she said.&#xD;
He stood before her, cap in hand.&#xD;
"How did my litttle friend pass the&#xD;
night?"  he  asked, extending  his&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Thank you, Captain. I had some&#xD;
rest. Sit, please."&#xD;
He drew a chair.&#xD;
"Well, you will be surprised to&#xD;
know that I have seen Col. Brantly's&#xD;
only sister and a niece.  Two ladies&#xD;
the very types of hospitality and re-&#xD;
finement."&#xD;
Hal was ghostly pale, and as silent.&#xD;
"You are, my little friend, to be&#xD;
the companion of the younger, and&#xD;
the beneficiary of the elder for so long&#xD;
a time as you desire. Doing any&#xD;
service to relieve the embarrassment&#xD;
of dependence, or not, as you please:'!&#xD;
Still no reply.&#xD;
"As to any conditions, there are&#xD;
none for you to accept. You go there&#xD;
as my friend, and with my assurance,&#xD;
that Brantly approves of what I do.&#xD;
Mrs St. Clair opens her door and&#xD;
arms to you."&#xD;
"She is very kind, Captain, but&#xD;
does she know  who I am?    Could&#xD;
you desire to insult her with the&#xD;
presence ofan enemy in her family?&#xD;
&#xD;
How practically  impossible!   How&#xD;
great the presumption on your part!&#xD;
Let not zeal overstep discretion."&#xD;
"Hal, (excuse me, dear lady, I for-&#xD;
got myself) Mistress Hal, neither you&#xD;
nor she entirely knows who you are.&#xD;
She is as mystified as you. Both are&#xD;
partly right and partly in the dark.&#xD;
Don't ask   me at once to bring the&#xD;
golden fleece of ransom.  The  bulls&#xD;
and dragons are yet in my way, but&#xD;
the daughter of Etes will lend her aid."&#xD;
He spoke cheerfully to comfcrt her.&#xD;
"We shall win!   Hal, I only want&#xD;
your confidence.   You   are brave.&#xD;
Let us fight this trouble down. Trust&#xD;
me. I shall neither deceive nor hum-&#xD;
ble you. What say you?"&#xD;
He leaned over anxiously watching&#xD;
her&#xD;
"If what she does not know, is put&#xD;
with what I do know, will there be a&#xD;
hope of light?  I cannot lend myself&#xD;
to an experiment at the expense of&#xD;
hospitality."&#xD;
She looked anxiously at the strong&#xD;
man. A look that seemed to say, I&#xD;
dare trust you, -yet why should I."&#xD;
"Yes; but I have a condition to&#xD;
exact if you accept ! You are to be&#xD;
the guest !  Wait for developments.&#xD;
Time will unfold them. If active&#xD;
energy can push time, I will promise&#xD;
the energy. To turn back now Hal,&#xD;
is to take your feet from the thresh-&#xD;
hold of a door of refuge.  You doubt&#xD;
what ! Your own name,?"&#xD;
"No;" she said, springing to her&#xD;
feet. Leave me sir! I am of honor-&#xD;
able birth if-."&#xD;
"You, are deceived as to your name&#xD;
Hal! Your birth is honorable.   Be&#xD;
calm. I pledge my honor for both&#xD;
the statements I make ! Sit down."&#xD;
Hal slowly took her chair trembling&#xD;
with excitement.&#xD;
"Not Hal Armour?" she asked,&#xD;
with great tears in her eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
I       i&#xD;
&#xD;
"My&#xD;

Where&#xD;

&#xD;
"No; but just as good ! Hal Pren-&#xD;

Prentiss, your foster parent. His&#xD;
brother was your father. It is an assum-&#xD;

His christian appellation was Eugene&#xD;
Armour Prentiss."&#xD;
"Honestly sir, on the honor of a&#xD;
man, and in response to the prayer of&#xD;
a woman thrice stabbed, can I claim&#xD;
lawfully any name?"&#xD;
Hal placed her hand on his arm.&#xD;
Her lustral eyes seemed to search to&#xD;
the core of his being. A sublime&#xD;
despair raised her above the sickly&#xD;
prudishness of affected modesty. She&#xD;
was ready for the last blow-dishonor-&#xD;
ed by a father ! Nameless.&#xD;
The lines swept her memory:&#xD;
T'were better far, unknown and left,&#xD;
Of home and kindred. Lone and lost,&#xD;
Than be, andI yet of name bereft."&#xD;
"Oh heaven, spare me! Spare me&#xD;
this much. Tell me sir !" he plead&#xD;
passionately, "that I am not a name-&#xD;
less thing."&#xD;
"No, no! Be calm! I meant not to&#xD;
disturb you thus. In trying to deal&#xD;
lightly with your father's folly I&#xD;
touched a sensitive cord. Hal, your&#xD;
mother was in lawful wedlock when&#xD;
you were   born.  It is   subsequent&#xD;
events that made him use this decep-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
Chris tried to sooth her, it was vain.&#xD;
"Safe," she screamed and dropped&#xD;
upon her knees with clasped hands.&#xD;
The scout wiped a briny tear from&#xD;
his eyes and stood while her livid lips&#xD;
quivered with silent gratitude.  Per-&#xD;
haps the first that pulsed her heart.&#xD;
She reached him a band and stood&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
FAR OFF PEACE.-APPOMATTOX.&#xD;
Hal had been an inmate at the&#xD;
Oaks homestead for several months,&#xD;
yef not a word nor hint passed the&#xD;
lips of either of the three constant&#xD;
companions concerning the cause of&#xD;
her temporary stay in Georgia.&#xD;
She pleasantly and freely conversed&#xD;
upon any matter incidental to either&#xD;
Brantly or Ralph.    Her searching&#xD;
look examined in vain the placid&#xD;
countenance of Mrs St. Clair (whom&#xD;
she had learned to love devotedly)&#xD;
for anything pointing to a knowledge&#xD;
of her own sad history.&#xD;
Even if occasion required the&#xD;
reference to Pearl's orphanage, Mrs.&#xD;
St. Clair carefully alluded to her&#xD;
protege, as my younger sister's child.&#xD;
There may have been two St. Clairs&#xD;
who married the two sisters, she&#xD;
thought.   Howard   was a cousin's&#xD;
child. This she had heard. She had&#xD;
learned of Howard's flirtation with&#xD;
Eva Crawford, of his recent visit&#xD;
home, and she saw that he was in ill&#xD;
favor with his relatives.  There was&#xD;
little of intercourse with the members&#xD;
of Howard's house because of the&#xD;
coldness. Other neighbors she pre&#xD;
ferred avoiding when calls were made&#xD;
which were not infrequentt.&#xD;
It was easy to retire to her chamber&#xD;
as soon as the vehicles entered the&#xD;
front yard.   The excuse was alway:&#xD;
accepted: "The lady's troubles compe&#xD;
her to prefer seclusion.'&#xD;
Hal's usual vocation was reading t&#xD;
her kind hostess as the latter sat sew&#xD;
ing.   Her full, yet musical voice&#xD;
careful notation of expression, an&#xD;
lively appreciation of any subject t&#xD;
be read, made    her an   acceptab&#xD;
reader.&#xD;
Mrs.,St. Clair sought to draw o&#xD;
Hal's inner life as it were, without&#xD;
suspicion being excited by the latte&#xD;
&#xD;
A paragraph analagous to her ex-&#xD;
periences, if read, would   elicit a&#xD;
searching criticism.&#xD;
Hal entered the lists of argument&#xD;
pleasantly, yet never exposed a per-&#xD;
sonal incident of life.  For instance,&#xD;
she read:&#xD;
"Bianca Capello     was  indebted&#xD;
more to nature than to fortune. Iher&#xD;
fine person, insinuating manners and&#xD;
aspiring temper, led to adventures&#xD;
that developed a talent for intri-&#xD;
gues, which demanded subtilty and&#xD;
craft.  The   virtues of the woman&#xD;
were sacrificed, to unwomanly ambi-&#xD;
tions.  What nature had made glori-&#xD;
ous, surrounding influences had mar&#xD;
red."&#xD;
"Why should she have permitted&#xD;
the unsexing of self to ambitions out&#xD;
of her sphere, even if she dazzled a&#xD;
court or swayed a transitory realm of&#xD;
petty aims? Woman's sphere is limit-&#xD;
ed, yet vast."&#xD;
Mrs St Clair sewed on without&#xD;
looking up.&#xD;
"I have no doubt, dear friend, that&#xD;
she like many    others, even of the&#xD;
sterner sex, gave way to the surround-&#xD;
ing influences. Small at first, yet&#xD;
resistless if continued. An acorn&#xD;
planted under a castle wall will cast it&#xD;
down or force its plumb, if the tree is&#xD;
r allowed to grow. Henry VIII meant&#xD;
e well. Surrounding influences made&#xD;
§ him neither honorable or kingly. The&#xD;
l monarch was the tool of the subject.&#xD;
Could influences be countermet or&#xD;
o avoided, destinies might be defeated."&#xD;
- Hal read on.&#xD;
, Mrs St. Clair wondered how soon&#xD;
od she could strike the seal from the&#xD;
to hidden secret.&#xD;
he   It was a lovely day when Hal and&#xD;
Pearllstrolled to the neighborhood&#xD;

the loss of faith in God. Doubtless&#xD;
your loss of property, of friends, of&#xD;
anything, of everything, may at times&#xD;
eloquently stand up as witnesses to&#xD;
say, 'all these things are against me,'&#xD;
but, let us pass on if need belike&#xD;
Cranmer to the fire, let us drink if it&#xD;
must be,the cup to the acrid dregs,&#xD;
let us be stripped like,&#xD;
"A ship by cruel tempests driven,&#xD;
And cast a wreck upon the foaming sea!"&#xD;
Let us say, I am the one who hath&#xD;
seen affliction by the rod of his wrath!&#xD;
Cry out as Job, cursed is the day&#xD;
when they said a child is born, still,&#xD;
under it all, what then?"&#xD;
Pearl had caught Hal's hand.&#xD;
Hal stood with eyes fastened on the&#xD;
cold slab.&#xD;
"What then? sweet) Hal! Alone,&#xD;
poor, friendless, sick, suffering, dying.&#xD;
Even this ! None to catch the last&#xD;
word, close the dead eye, fold the stiff&#xD;
hands, compose the last posture of&#xD;
death. Even then, is victory !&#xD;
Think Hal, of that scene when the&#xD;
sun refused to shine and nature sprang&#xD;
in spasms of horror; when the dead&#xD;
cast off the grave cerements to gaze on&#xD;
the victory, as He cried out,' it is&#xD;
finished.'&#xD;
Dear Hal, by letting God's spirit&#xD;
sow the seed, not we in our finiteness,&#xD;
you will see as it were face to face !&#xD;
Your rock of hindrance will be a&#xD;
great shadow for repose ! You will&#xD;
have a child's portion, and with a&#xD;
heroic strength may say: I'll trust him&#xD;
though he slay me."&#xD;
The bell tolled for service.&#xD;
Hal said: ''Let us go in."&#xD;
During the services she enjoyed the&#xD;
devotions heartily.&#xD;
Not unfrequently after this when at&#xD;
prayer, Hal's warm fingers folded&#xD;
Pearl's hand.&#xD;
A year had now gone by. Lee had&#xD;
pushed Grant back at the Wilderness.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Southern cross glittered grandly&#xD;
among the coronets of nations, and&#xD;
above the clouds of doubt. But there&#xD;
was only one army left after three&#xD;
years of incomparable fighting.&#xD;
Seven had been wiped out by defeat.&#xD;
The one was Lee's. The seven&#xD;
those of the Federal Union.&#xD;
Lee's stripped to the buff and reds&#xD;
at every pore. It was invincible, yet,&#xD;
it was flesh and blood.&#xD;
It was wasting under the constant&#xD;
assaults.&#xD;
One mighty venture must be made&#xD;
on the Chess board of war-"Getty.--&#xD;
burg."        I&#xD;
On   July   2nd   and   3rd Lee's&#xD;
veterans held Gettysburg almost as if&#xD;
by supermilitary achievement.   T he&#xD;
Confederates   mingled   with   the&#xD;
dejected  citizens,  and   eat  and&#xD;
drank   quietly  in  the  surround-&#xD;
ing horms, as they rode masters every-&#xD;
where.  What the great gorge was,&#xD;
(cut by the rains of yesterday) at&#xD;
Waterloo, to Napoleon, so was the&#xD;
Round top to Lee. Be ordered it&#xD;
covered, God decreed that it should&#xD;
not be covered.&#xD;
The crisis had come.&#xD;
The" fourth'1 found Hancock's divi-&#xD;
sion instead of Longstreet's peering&#xD;
from the height.&#xD;
The vantage of ground was pitted&#xD;
against that of fighting qualities.&#xD;
At night the struggle ended. The&#xD;
boom of shell screamed sadly the&#xD;
last pean and a few hours at night&#xD;
gave truce.&#xD;
Gettysburg was lost.&#xD;
Lee's immortals were mangled to a&#xD;
pulp.&#xD;
Backeto Virginia! Then the long&#xD;
seige before Petersburg.  Then   re-&#xD;
pulses, sorties, victories strung out&#xD;
like a wondrous story on the historic&#xD;
page.&#xD;
Lee's army defiant, grand, held at&#xD;
&#xD;
_-:.&#xD;

&#xD;
its last tension, delivered its awful&#xD;
blows from an arm inured to re-&#xD;
sistance.  Wasting, dwindling, sta rv-&#xD;
i'g, it  concentrated  l4t at A p-&#xD;
pomattox&#xD;
"Appomattox."   Cut   the   n   e inc&#xD;
where it will survive brass.&#xD;
Place it where the pilgrim may doft&#xD;
his sandal shooi, to rest and read in&#xD;
wonderment.&#xD;
Appomattox, the grave of constitu-&#xD;
tional liberty. The funeral ground&#xD;
of a nation's hopes.&#xD;
The shrine of the Southron's valor.&#xD;
Sixteen thousand and seven hun-&#xD;
dred muskets in as many ragged,&#xD;
barefoot, starving men's hands.&#xD;
One   hundred  and  ten thousand&#xD;
Federals in front. Sixty. thousand&#xD;
closing in on the flanks. Gay flags,&#xD;
rolling  drums and    fished legions&#xD;
fronted the squalid Confederates.&#xD;
The tiger was at hay.&#xD;
The hunters keens.&#xD;
Longstreet and Gordon    emerged&#xD;
from an old farm house and mounting&#xD;
rode rapidly to the ragged troops.&#xD;
Hunger stared gaunt from    their&#xD;
cheeks, desperation flashed dangerous-&#xD;
ly from wild eyes.&#xD;
"Cut your way through.'&#xD;
Now for the old time grip on the&#xD;
musket stock.&#xD;
,Steady ! Wait fior orders.&#xD;
General Lee says, "cut your way&#xD;
through."&#xD;
"Forward !"&#xD;
Apponmiftox. ,&#xD;
The blue line is hid in rel flashes&#xD;
and smoke. They see the tiger&#xD;
fangs. They know what portends.&#xD;
Then rose for once again and forever&#xD;
the cleaving "Ya, ya, va!"&#xD;
Like a keen wedge the (onfederate&#xD;

lute a terbaccy plant, you in the bar-&#xD;
gin ! Now take a fool's advice and let&#xD;
Wolf alone.&#xD;
Well, he didn't.   I tried to git&#xD;
him clear, but Preecher Hoge used to&#xD;
say, bray a fool in a mortar you mets&#xD;
him no less a fool.  He run agin the&#xD;
Wolf and he got a slug in his skull,&#xD;
that's all."&#xD;
"Poor Ike !" returned Ruger.&#xD;
"Poor   Prudence,   better  say&#xD;
Where's the dimes to come from?&#xD;
Who'll anti up the noodles?"&#xD;
Ruger felt a pity for the old hag&#xD;
and drew out some of his pay. She&#xD;
took it, rubbed it over and over&#xD;
then slipped it among her rags.&#xD;
"I wish Ruger, I could make you&#xD;
glad to-day, but I can't. I used ter hear&#xD;
a old schoolmaster say onst't, what I&#xD;
never forgot. I usedter sweep the&#xD;
schoolroom. He was fond of what he&#xD;
called  English  classics. The boys&#xD;
would get him to read for them. One&#xD;
day he read:&#xD;
"Yet neer it was my fate from thee to find,&#xD;
A deed ungentle or a word unkind."&#xD;
You was always a 'spectful little&#xD;
cub, ef you don't know me now, and&#xD;
and I never yeered any meanness&#xD;
bout yer."&#xD;
"Thank you Prudence! That's as&#xD;
good as I deserve, and better than&#xD;
I've beard in years."&#xD;
"You'se welcome, because it's all&#xD;
you'll get flattering from me."&#xD;
"Why Prudence? I've done you no&#xD;
ill, nor have any of mine, I hope."&#xD;
"You'w righ t honey! You'se done&#xD;

"Tell it, I will ! T'was your daddy,&#xD;
that got me to steal her from  the old&#xD;
people in Carliny when she wasn't&#xD;
bigger'n a chick !&#xD;
T'was me as brung her to the&#xD;
Benthams, where she stayed till she&#xD;
was a pert poult.&#xD;
T'was your daddy, that fetched you&#xD;
along five years arterward,a sturdy&#xD;
brat, and put you wid old Priti s.&#xD;
Tell me to tell it ! Oh, I can tell&#xD;
it !"&#xD;
-Who do you mean old slattern, ny&#xD;
my father?  Don't lie on him or his.&#xD;
I am   not too  go-d to wring your&#xD;
skinny neck."&#xD;
Ruger was on his feet.&#xD;
"Mean !" she answered defiantly.&#xD;
"I mean Eugene Armour Prentiss!&#xD;
Born and raised near Baltimore. The&#xD;
sport who gamed away all the monev&#xD;
he got hands on. The fine fellow&#xD;
that went South and married a pretty&#xD;
pale thing and left her. The same&#xD;
wide awake who dropped his surname&#xD;
Prentiss  for  Armour    to   cover&#xD;
his    past    meanness,    married&#xD;
a  school   Miss   and   broke  her&#xD;
heart, then came to the eend of his&#xD;
string by cheating a gentleman at&#xD;
cards, who put a bullet in him.&#xD;
I mean that your daddy did all&#xD;
this and I swears to it."&#xD;
The hag swayed back and forth.&#xD;
"You kin grind your molars honey,&#xD;
it's more'n I kin do."&#xD;
"You said, old slut, that you stole&#xD;
her; who do you mean? Let it all&#xD;
come !"&#xD;
"It's a coming Ruger ! I wouldn't he&#xD;
misable all by myself for nothing&#xD;

"And you're a liar for saying it,&#xD;

"I'll ask Hal, and if you lie I'll&#xD;

"Hal! She's a spoilt vixen ! She&#xD;
ain't to home."&#xD;
"Not at home?" returned Ruger in&#xD;
alarm; "where is she?"&#xD;
"The Wolf got her too !"'&#xD;
Roger seized Prudence by the arm,&#xD;
trembling in every fibre.&#xD;
"When ! How? Oh, where? tell me&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
EVA's VIsIT.--THE CARTEL&#xD;
Pearl and Ralph were seated in a&#xD;
summer house the morning succeeding&#xD;
the latter's arrival. Hal was gather-&#xD;
ing flowers  near   by, apparently&#xD;
pleasantly occupied. Ralph had re-&#xD;
ceived such charming accounts of&#xD;
Pearl's companion, that, he knew her&#xD;
before his arrival and was installed&#xD;
on the best terms at once in her con-&#xD;
fidence.&#xD;
Why should he object then, in Hal's&#xD;
company, to sit pleasantly chatting&#xD;
with Pearl's white fingers in his?&#xD;
A snorting span of blacks drag&#xD;
ging  a  stylish  landeau,  whirled&#xD;
around the fish basin, when Miss&#xD;
Eva Crawford catching sight of the&#xD;
party, ordered the driver to bold up.&#xD;
She jumped out, passed Hal with a&#xD;
door hinge bow, that meant, who are&#xD;
you? and joined the party.&#xD;
After a careful adjustment of the&#xD;
abundant envelopment of stuffs which&#xD;
she wore, and which were foreign to&#xD;
most ladies in the South so soon after&#xD;
hostilities, she  poised  her  boots&#xD;
artistically, (only to show them, spang&#xD;
new.)&#xD;
Her fan was set in excited motion,&#xD;
then suddenly arrested as she said to&#xD;
Pearl, "How close you've kept your-&#xD;
self this long time?"&#xD;
"I found enough diversion, Eva,&#xD;
lately in home duties."&#xD;
"But now, guess you'll be thinking&#xD;
of a Northern tour, eh?"&#xD;
The impertinent stare that attendeI&#xD;
the question, stung the poor, sad heart&#xD;
while it roused the latent fire of the&#xD;
soul of the refugee, who stood hesitat-&#xD;
ing with duty whether a reply were&#xD;
in place or not.&#xD;
Pearl shook her head with a cau-&#xD;
tion to Eva. "The lady near by is a&#xD;
Northerner. Be careful !" whispered&#xD;
Pearl.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Oh, ind eed . No har m m lieanlt . i)&#xD;
none."&#xD;
lava h ad removed a gI(ve, h  lav.&#xD;
ing a glittering ring.&#xD;
"Pearl, swe t ! suu nt so      r&#xD;
get  late  inju al -iis  :  to ;' meeen  oI r i&#xD;
awhile. Tw ul1 he traitorous  V  - 1;&#xD;
blush so. I am not a'cusiugi tayun&#xD;
Hal heard    the  re-iterate(  -&#xD;
Casting a contemjpio en(, glane ai tb&#xD;
worlhng she m)otved a way.&#xD;
"If the solitaire  u)il li y l&#xD;
gests aii thing. Eva ! lYou n 11&#xD;
b'oke(d for a trip."&#xD;
"Oh! have yoa seen   it air   .&#xD;
Sw iet.'" Eva afiecteul to hide tin ':r&#xD;
"That's only a keepsake ! '  u1,&#xD;
mo- re."&#xD;
The giddy Eva ran on fLr an   nur&#xD;
then extended an in vitation t( 1&#xD;
and R dph to unite with a coil .&#xD;
for a proposed fair to raise  !' pzi&#xD;
t-r's overdue salary. Shaking&#xD;
daintily she hurried to her:'i&#xD;
and was whirled awav.&#xD;
Ralph proposed a ride after 1&#xD;
"Hal," he said, "woul enjoy Kt -,&#xD;
die., Pearl and I will take t ;&#xD;
wagon&#xD;
Hal heard the proposition&#xD;
pleased.&#xD;
"The nag you'll ride H alii,  i&#xD;
but is a gay mnover. I found him  u l&#xD;
grit on the way home."&#xD;
Hal little dreamed 01 the grn&#xD;
surprise in store for her.&#xD;
"That lhagard   Chris, I won&#xD;
where lie is; bugged lii  ifr; Ala&#xD;
Hal was wondering just tihe' uh&#xD;
the  laggard  was.  It  was tph,  at&#xD;
clear up the heavy pall that ei '&#xD;
her every thought.&#xD;
Chris was jogging towards t '&#xD;
on ol(1 Rocket.  He had talon&#xD;
faithful east when Sei io  tolM  t.&#xD;
that Ralph rode the other bo(ri&#xD;
The family were all at( dinW&#xD;
joying a bountiful cheer as the  -v&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
7 3&#xD;
&#xD;
scout rode up.  Every seat was de-&#xD;
serted save Hal's.  The chair trei-&#xD;
bled under her but she    remained&#xD;
quiet.&#xD;
11 Come in, you  deserter! Where&#xD;
have you been?"&#xD;
This, with Pearl's ringing  laugh&#xD;
and Mrs St Clair's smile of welcome&#xD;
rallied the dusty, delapidated veteran.&#xD;
"Come here Ralph! Ladies excuse&#xD;
him a moment."&#xD;
Chris raised his hat aloft respeefui-&#xD;
ly.  Ralph ran to his side.&#xD;
"I'll come in after you have loaned&#xD;
me another rig. Direct mhe to your&#xD;
bathhouse; 'twill be as acceptable as a&#xD;
ialf bushel of oats to old Rocket."&#xD;
Ralph ordered young Scip to take&#xD;
the horse. Dinner was deferred for&#xD;
the scout.&#xD;
In a half hour Chris walked in on&#xD;
Ralph's arm, a handsome, well dress-&#xD;
ed civilian. Extending his hand first&#xD;
to Ralph's mother then to the rest ot&#xD;
the household, he said:&#xD;
"Now, best of friends, a chair in&#xD;
your happy midst and the German&#xD;
blessing, guten appetit."&#xD;
The dinner was no more a substan-&#xD;
tial southern spread of good things,&#xD;
than a feast of hearty confidence and&#xD;
re-union.&#xD;
Hal thought, his face is bright,&#xD;
does it augur well?  One  never can&#xD;
-tell, he is so passionless.&#xD;
"You take   your ride, I've had&#xD;
enough of it. Haven't been  out of&#xD;
saddle except to feed o1(1 Rocket but&#xD;
once since    --&#xD;
He paused.  )id he think o his&#xD;
old father's grave at the nodest little&#xD;
desolated home, or did his mind go&#xD;
back to the field when he saw (uter&#xD;
foppishly charging with legions toi&#xD;
suit afew Confederates, by the    liii&#xD;
pant order, "Surrender.'  Or, (lid 1&#xD;
think of both.&#xD;

&#xD;
i&#xD;
gi  ;&#xD;
&#xD;
"You ride; I will sit with miiadami&#xD;
and talk, if she' l let me smoke.&#xD;
It was agreed that the ride should&#xD;
e had.&#xD;
The pony carriage was trot te(l 1p.&#xD;
Pearl was handed     in.  The  ostler&#xD;
stood at the hits while Ralph waited&#xD;
to see Ilat On the saddle.&#xD;
The jueenI  y woman appeared in&#xD;
Pearl's habit,'a dark bhIue body  an(&#xD;
skirt,a jaunty cap with a white feather.&#xD;
A whip hung on her arm as hle drew&#xD;

&#xD;
Hal was following at a smart canter,&#xD;
when -she discovered a cloud of dust&#xD;
to the left on the road divided by a&#xD;
fence.&#xD;
A buggy top glanced under the&#xD;
fence rows as the vehicle rapidly&#xD;
swept for the main road evidently&#xD;
forced to keep up with Ralph.&#xD;
The speed of the vehicle, lively&#xD;
chatter of the occupants and neighing&#xD;
of horses, excited Count. The stal-&#xD;
lion plunged for a rim but was re-&#xD;
strained.&#xD;
Now he began to rear and   leap;&#xD;
Hal meanwhile coaxing and manag-&#xD;
ing him dexterously.&#xD;
She raised her hand to caution the&#xD;
driver of the near team to hold down.&#xD;
He saw the violent exertions of the&#xD;
horse, but did not slack speed. On he&#xD;
went.&#xD;
Count made a furious leap. The&#xD;
saddle girth parted.&#xD;
Hal felt the saddle sliding and&#xD;
sprang clear, at the same time jerking&#xD;
her horse down on his haunches to&#xD;
complete submission.&#xD;
Howard and Eva looked back,&#xD;
but made no effort to assist her.&#xD;
Ralph hearing approaching wheels&#xD;
turned and saw Howard urging his&#xD;
trotters to their best speed with a view&#xD;
to passing him.&#xD;
Not seeing Hal, Ralph reined up&#xD;
offering a stiff salute to Howard and&#xD;
Miss Crawford as the4as.ed, then&#xD;
turned and drove back.&#xD;
Hal was quietly repairing the girth.&#xD;
The restless Count stood pawing un-&#xD;
der a limb, where he was hitched.&#xD;
"You did not fall Hal?" inquired&#xD;
Ralph, seeing that her skirt was soiled.&#xD;
"No; but that ill bred fellow tried&#xD;
his best to have me fall, if reckless&#xD;
driving past a plunging horse could&#xD;
do it. Count is ruined! He wants a&#xD;
good snaffle and plenty of whip. A&#xD;
curb does not suit him at all."&#xD;
&#xD;
Hal had fastened the girth strap,&#xD;
when she burst forth to a rippling&#xD;
laugh, advancing to the buggy.&#xD;
"The dust and cavorting    of ty&#xD;
nag shut out the genus homo. Wasn't&#xD;
that Miss Crawford? She reminds me&#xD;
of the pasquinade.",&#xD;
"What, disbelieve the Dodo;&#xD;
The like was never heard,&#xD;
Derive the face of nature&#xD;
Of such a wondrous bird&#xD;
Her parasol was held as if under it&#xD;
was point d'appui. Such a chatter&#xD;
ing thing would drown a parrot."&#xD;
"Yes," replied  Pearl, "that was&#xD;
Eva Crawford with Howard Graham.&#xD;
They are engaged."&#xD;
The girth fell from  Hal's hands.&#xD;
She staggered back.&#xD;
Ralph leapt out and caught her,&#xD;
as with a groan she closed her eves.&#xD;
"She's hurt Pearl!" Ralph ran to&#xD;
the roadside and steeped his handker-&#xD;
chief. Returning he spread the wet&#xD;
application on her temples.&#xD;
Pearl loosed her neck and  fanned&#xD;
the pale face.  Patiently  the  lovers&#xD;
watched her, until glad ly they saw her&#xD;
beautiful eyes open.&#xD;
."Is that you sweetest, and you to)&#xD;
Ralph?"&#xD;
The tears flowed freely.&#xD;
"I had a great shock, but I am&#xD;
better now."&#xD;
She was lifted on the  buggy  seat.&#xD;
Pearl drove slowly home. Ralph rode&#xD;
Count. Neither of the    two  knew&#xD;
what Hal meant, when she referred&#xD;
so  familiarly to   Count   Neither&#xD;
dreamed of the cause of her swoon.&#xD;
Up to the present, neither Chris&#xD;
Spangler or Mrs St Clair had made men-&#xD;
tion to anyone of Hal's secret. The&#xD;
sequel was fast forcing itself on them.&#xD;
Hal was assisted to her chamber,&#xD;
where Pearl tenderly cared for her.&#xD;
'"I am not hurt, dear Pearl," -he&#xD;
&#xD;
would say, while the hri ht tea'r drops C&#xD;
ran fast down her cheeks.           b&#xD;
Ralph mentioned the affair to Chris f&#xD;
Spangler, and said:&#xD;
'I shall call on the fellow  for an t&#xD;
apology or horsewhip him."&#xD;
"Just leave that to me, my boy, I'm&#xD;
awfully out of a job. Besides I amihs-&#xD;
interested; you re a cousin. Illsec iim  1&#xD;
and get an apology, or a back down.&#xD;
"All right.; I don't want the fani-&#xD;
lies involved, but Chris have him  do&#xD;
the amende honorable or make   him&#xD;
take water."&#xD;
Old Rocket and his level headed&#xD;
rider slipped out of the  back  gate&#xD;
quietly.&#xD;
Mrs St. Clair had seen the friends&#xD;
talking and apprehended trouble&#xD;
Chris rode away unseen. He reined&#xD;
up at a shooting lodge where he saw&#xD;
a buggy standing. Halting, he asked&#xD;
if Mr Howard Graham was around.&#xD;
The individual 1f question was at&#xD;
the moment examining      a   pretty&#xD;
pointer pup. He looked up.&#xD;
"Yes, I am he!"&#xD;
"Am gratified to meet you!"&#xD;
Chris dismounted and hitched.&#xD;
"Mr Ralph St. Clair requests ain&#xD;
apology for the injury done a lady in&#xD;
his care a couple of hours ago, and&#xD;
deputized me to receive it, verbal or&#xD;
written."&#xD;
"Indeed!" replied Howard, haugh-&#xD;
tily.&#xD;
"He does not     wait to , e   i&#xD;
the apology is to he voluntary, as it&#xD;
should be from a gentleman, but, de-&#xD;
mands it."&#xD;
"The demand     is none too soon, I&#xD;
assure you.   The oflense was k no\\ I&#xD;
to you. You saw the lady's conliti1n&#xD;
and as a gentleman should have ptlc&#xD;
ped, both to assist and apologuire.- fh&#xD;

past."&#xD;
"Then kindly say to Mr Ralph' 't&#xD;

THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
and gentlemen, my friends, I would&#xD;
tan you with what has not yet been&#xD;
tanned. Make the apology or take a&#xD;
rawhide horsewhipping."&#xD;
Chris advanced.&#xD;
Howard sprang in the lodge to&#xD;
se'e a shot gun he kept there, but the&#xD;
broad hand of the ex-scout was in his.&#xD;
collar. He hurled Howard back&#xD;
inside of the door and taking the gun&#xD;
snapped it at the grip by-a blow  on&#xD;
the floor. Then going outside again&#xD;
he faced Howard who was advancing&#xD;
with a club.&#xD;
The club was swung and the de-&#xD;
scending blow fell on the sturdy arm&#xD;
of the athletic man in front, who&#xD;
seized and wrenched it from Howard's&#xD;
grasp as a play thing.&#xD;
The baffled Howard made a rush to&#xD;
strike, when he was caught, twisted&#xD;
about and sent flying into the ditch at&#xD;
the road side where he floundered in&#xD;
slime and water.&#xD;
"You shall hear from me, bully,"&#xD;
shouted  Howard  climbing  to the&#xD;
road.&#xD;
"I hope I shall, that you are repent-&#xD;
ant for your rudeness to one who can-&#xD;
not redress her own wrongs.  If I&#xD;
hear anything else, I may be tempted&#xD;
to play nurse for you.&#xD;
Just bear in mind always, that a&#xD;
rooting hog deserves a ring in its&#xD;
snout."&#xD;
Chris mounted and road away.&#xD;
Reaching home, he recited to Ralph&#xD;
the result of the visit.  The roar of&#xD;
laughter that followed, caused Pearl&#xD;
to send word that, "it was selfish to&#xD;
have so much fun to themselves.&#xD;
Could they not let the family enjoy a&#xD;
share?"&#xD;
Chris was overhauling the farm&#xD;
wagons, and renewing odds and ends,&#xD;
on the day following when a dapper&#xD;
character rode to the shop door, looked&#xD;
in and dismounted    p&#xD;
&#xD;
"Good day sir," began the caller.&#xD;
"Good day   sir," returned  Chris&#xD;
looking up from his work.&#xD;
"Mister Wolf, I presume sir!"&#xD;
The prim visitor pulled up his&#xD;
collar and coughed to clear his throat.&#xD;
"No   sir!  You are in error," re-&#xD;
plied Chris, humoring the mistake.&#xD;
"Not Wolf! Strange.     Was so in-&#xD;
formed!   Beg pardon.     Name sir,&#xD;
please "&#xD;
"If it is of interest, or may he, von&#xD;
are welcome to it; if not, then excuse&#xD;
me, as I am satisfied to have a limited&#xD;
acquaintance."&#xD;
Chris began to fill his pipe, the&#xD;
companion of either an active or pas.&#xD;
sive condition.&#xD;
"Beg   pardon!    Tis of interest.&#xD;
Concerns a gentleman's honor, sir.&#xD;
My friend Howard Graham, after re-&#xD;
lating the small affair between you&#xD;
and   him, to  me, asked  my advice.&#xD;
I gave it. Suppose you recognize the&#xD;
situation, if we are at fault about the&#xD;
name! Small matter anyway."&#xD;
Chris sat on a saw bench while the&#xD;
priggish visitor stood.&#xD;
He eyed the dressy chap from head&#xD;
to foot, as he inquired.&#xD;
"Well, what next?"&#xD;
"This, sir!"&#xD;
A   neatly   folded  missive  was&#xD;
handed the ex-scout.&#xD;
Chris laid the document down as he&#xD;
blew   the   nicotine  through   his&#xD;
pipe   stem     Finding    the  pipe&#xD;
to be not as free as he desired, he&#xD;
quietly procured a straw and.forced it&#xD;
through. Then the pipe was not&#xD;
quite charged; he had to renew.&#xD;
The irate visitor began to show im-&#xD;
patience.&#xD;
Meanwhile the pipe had been lit;&#xD;
Chris opened the missive and read it.&#xD;
"Sir ! Your assault of yesterday&#xD;
demands an apology. I can in no way&#xD;
connect it with the discourteous de-&#xD;
&#xD;
r'&#xD;
&#xD;
mand you saw fit to make for another.&#xD;
That is his and my affair. My friend,&#xD;
Mr. Julian Altemont will make all&#xD;
arrangements (,n my behalf. Yours&#xD;
&amp;amp;c. Howard Graham."&#xD;
Chris rose and carefully deposited&#xD;
the note in the slumbering coals of&#xD;
the forge, then turning said:&#xD;
"Mr. Julian Altemont, if your busi-&#xD;
ness is at an end, mine is about to be-&#xD;
gin."&#xD;
The ex scout lifted a grease bucket&#xD;
containing a compound of tar and&#xD;
tallow with which he was ready to&#xD;
paint the dapper gentleman's vest and&#xD;
pantaloons, when the latter wisely&#xD;
stepped out of the door, remarking:&#xD;
"It is clearly evident, Mr. Wolf is&#xD;
not read up on Wilson. We'll meet&#xD;
you sir, in some other way, but we&#xD;
must be satisfied."&#xD;
As    Mr.  Altemont rode away,&#xD;
young Sspip rolled in, indulging in a&#xD;
series of contortions bordering upon&#xD;
insanity as he wriggled on the shav-&#xD;
ings.&#xD;
"Lor a massy, Hebben; Oh ! I'se&#xD;
most dead. My whole side hurt me.&#xD;
I larf tell I hab spasm. Mars Chris,&#xD;
you ain't gee Mars Julian de time&#xD;
o'day. Look yer boss ! dat buckra&#xD;
sway he gwine ter shoot yer sune as&#xD;
he see you fuss time. Oh ladder !"&#xD;
The'negro rolled and laughed.&#xD;
"I see wen Mars Julian ride up, I&#xD;
say ugh, yer's trouble. Jewil and&#xD;
debblement. I put my yeers close to&#xD;
de   shop   winder.   I  look  ebry&#xD;

de buckra you name wen he ax you.&#xD;
Den I see you git de grease pot.!&#xD;
Mars Julian light out.  I sway Mars&#xD;
Chris you mout er treat em spe'tfil.&#xD;
Again the young negro roledinl&#xD;
the shavings.&#xD;
"Keep this from the ladies, yu&#xD;
monkey or I'll grease you."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes for !" replied the black, "but&#xD;
Miss Hal done see um already.   Him&#xD;
bin by de winder wen Mars Julian&#xD;
rid(, way."&#xD;
Ie was pleased to think that Hial&#xD;
was looking towards the    workshop.&#xD;
She is better, he thought; so she was.&#xD;
Hal took tea with the family that&#xD;
evening   After tea Mrs. St. ('lair en-&#xD;
joiyedl a light, rattan rocker, on the&#xD;
piazza.&#xD;
Ralph was at her fret on the steps.&#xD;
Hal remained in the paillr at a win-&#xD;
dow in full view of the group.  Pearl&#xD;
sat near Hal amusing herself with&#xD;
knitting. Chris, as usual, was pufinmg&#xD;
the fragrant cherry on the poreh.&#xD;
It w as a grand Southern night.&#xD;
The full faced moon hat hed the earth&#xD;
in  silver glory. The stars fiaded in&#xD;
the sheen. A faint, south wi ind rustled&#xD;
the great oaks and ehns.  I'e nmock-&#xD;
ing birds sant notes as of a rallying&#xD;
chorus. The household was enjoying&#xD;
the beautiful scene.&#xD;
A figure was seen advancing on the&#xD;
great carriage way. Ihe gate swung&#xD;

fish basin, the new comer mno ve(l to-&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
"Here I am ! I am very glad to&#xD;
see you! Uncle Scipio how are you?"&#xD;
"Lor bless your sweet soul, my&#xD;
missy, U'se tired  but hearty.  Oh&#xD;
missy. I is too joyful, too joyful to see&#xD;
you I"&#xD;
The family formed a delighted, in-&#xD;
quiring group, around the negro who&#xD;
had just reached home.&#xD;
Again and again he seized and&#xD;
pressed each hand as if his big heart&#xD;
could not contain its joy.&#xD;
Finally he discovered Hal seated&#xD;
in the window.&#xD;
He gazed upon her as if terrified,&#xD;
while his lower jaw fell.&#xD;
Chris saw the negro's perplexity&#xD;
and nodded assuringly to him.&#xD;
Scipio advanced to the inside of the&#xD;
parlor and taking Hal's extended&#xD;
hand, said calmly and feelingly:&#xD;
"I hope Miss Hal is quite well !"&#xD;
"Yes Scip, thank you. How are&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
Tank you mistiss, I is too glad for&#xD;
spressing how I is."&#xD;
The negro returned to Chris. Tug-&#xD;
ging at his hand, he led the scout to&#xD;
the far end of the piazza.&#xD;
"It's all right Scipio ! Just you&#xD;
keep mum."&#xD;
"My master; mars Chris !" returned&#xD;
the black in alow tone.&#xD;
"Ef you don't stonish me! Look&#xD;
yer boss. wot sort ob-er man is you&#xD;
ennyhow?"&#xD;
The negro returned and took a seat&#xD;
on the step, he recounted his adven-&#xD;
tures by the way until near midnight&#xD;
"Go see your wife and children&#xD;
now, said Mrs. St. Clair, "they'll be&#xD;
jealous if you do not."&#xD;
"Tank you mistiss! dem kin wait.&#xD;
I is too glad to git home once more."&#xD;
The delighted and half bewildered&#xD;
negro looked again towards Hal as&#xD;
she sat calmly at the open window.&#xD;
He could not divine the situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Such a conflict of circumstances rack-&#xD;
ed his mind in the eflrt to realize,&#xD;
that, it was truly she.&#xD;
He glanced at the cold collected&#xD;
ex scout, and drew a sigh of relief.&#xD;
"Well, I'se keepin de fiimbly up&#xD;
too  late. Good night all. I'll see&#xD;
you soon a mornin, please de Lord.&#xD;
Good night."&#xD;
Hat in hand Scipio walked towards&#xD;
the negro quarter&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
THE CLOUD RIFT.&#xD;
The mail of the week brought a&#xD;
letter from Colonel Brantly to Chris&#xD;
Spangler. It read:&#xD;
"My intention is, to seek foreign&#xD;
service. Before going, I would like&#xD;
to get your consent to take charge of&#xD;
and manage my plantation in Caro-&#xD;
lina. The direction of anything per-&#xD;
taining to it will be entirely with you.&#xD;
So far as compensation is concerned,&#xD;
you judge of that, after seeing the&#xD;
property and its advantages.  Not a&#xD;
word, my friend, have we exchanged&#xD;
since you removed the indiscreet Hal&#xD;
to Georgia, about her prospects, or any&#xD;
development to her benefit. I desire&#xD;
her mind disabused of any injustice&#xD;
done her father and    mother by mny&#xD;
family-(a bit of information had&#xD;
from you) and which led her unwise-&#xD;
ly to a reckless course of ill judged&#xD;
revenge.&#xD;
How could we desire, or what ends&#xD;
to be gained-if we were so base,&#xD;
since her parentage to me was at the&#xD;
time of the favx pas, and is now utter-&#xD;
ly unknown?&#xD;
The fact that she was a married&#xD;
woman was enough. I lived after&#xD;
that, and until you made her a prisoner,&#xD;
away, far away in body and vainly&#xD;
far in thought.&#xD;
Poor girl-she iwas deluded ! She&#xD;
has her virtues if her faults.' Help)&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
her to stand in the light of truth&#xD;
Direct to care of Judge Cleapor, where&#xD;
my stay will be principally until you&#xD;
are heard from."&#xD;
Chris repeated   "care  of Judge&#xD;
Cleapor, thought so ! Well, I'll see&#xD;
Mrs. St Clair and lift the curtain for&#xD;

"Ho,   Ralph !   do  yourself the&#xD;
pleasure and me the fivor to take&#xD;
Miss Pearl along to catch a mnormouth&#xD;
perch at the mill stream ! And don't&#xD;
come home until you bring at least&#xD;
One."&#xD;
"Get out ! perch do not bite this&#xD;
month in mill water. How'd you like&#xD;
a jack?" replied Ralph&#xD;
"Just, as good if it isn't a dapper&#xD;
skin. Honest though ! Your mother&#xD;
and I wish to have a talk with Hal&#xD;
this morning. It will he try ing to&#xD;
her poor girl.  We want also to spare&#xD;
Miss Pearl's feelings."&#xD;
"Thank you Chris ! You are always&#xD;
good.  We'll fish for good luck to&#xD;
Hal. I have often     wondered why&#xD;
that splendid pair of eyes dimmed so&#xD;
frequently."&#xD;
The  buggy had passed the gate,&#xD;
when Mrs. St. Clair called Hal to the&#xD;
parlor.&#xD;
Chris sat in the deep window look-&#xD;
ing out as she entered.&#xD;
Hal advanced and with a look that&#xD;
indicated, "the hour is at hand,' she&#xD;
took a seat.&#xD;
"Hal;" began the lady, "the w ar is&#xD;
over, communication is open, inter-&#xD;
course is being resumed, and I see by&#xD;
your face in the last few day that&#xD;
your thoughts are often turning to-&#xD;
wards home. Now, in the outset, let&#xD;
me assure you, that so long as yu lee&#xD;
fit to share ours with us, you may&#xD;
freely consider yourself part of our&#xD;
home."&#xD;
The   beautiful woman   arose and&#xD;
kissed the cheek of Mrs. St. lair.&#xD;
&#xD;
She   resumed  her chair   without&#xD;
uttering a word.&#xD;
"'Now nerve yourself I'fr a true tale!&#xD;
It. will pain no doubt, but I know it&#xD;

bling propensities, and died cruelly&#xD;
neglected, because too proud to tell of&#xD;
her misfortunes "&#xD;
"The children lived?" asked Hal&#xD;
with a sob.&#xD;
"One I know of positively, the oth-&#xD;
er, I am told, is alive. Your father's&#xD;
end you must have heard."&#xD;
Hal placed her handkerchief to her&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
Mrs St Clair advanced and took the&#xD;
weeping woman's hand. She still&#xD;
kept her eyes covered.&#xD;
Hal felt a ring slipping over a&#xD;
finger.&#xD;
She dropped the handkerchief as&#xD;
gasping she said:&#xD;
"What is this?"&#xD;
"Your mother's wedding ring child!&#xD;
I took it from her lifeless finger."&#xD;
"My mother; my mother !" scream-&#xD;
ed the soul-racked sufferer as she&#xD;
sprang forward and fell on the bosom&#xD;
of her kind benefactress.&#xD;
She lay there, the ring pressed to&#xD;
her livid lips. Her eyes fastened on&#xD;
vacancy! An Ariadne in loveliness and&#xD;
new born hope.&#xD;
Chris turned away. His - broad&#xD;
breast rose and fell like a swelling sea.&#xD;
Mrs. St. Clair sat, gently support-&#xD;
ing Hal who clung to her.&#xD;
"My mother !" again escaped the&#xD;
lips which were rivited to the ring.&#xD;
"Her grave ! Can I get to it?  Is&#xD;
it known sweet friend?"&#xD;
The sufferer looked up pleadingly&#xD;
"Yes Hal ! You may see it after&#xD;
awhile. It is a long way from here."&#xD;
"I'll walk there barefoot ! Mecca&#xD;
to a soul stained pilgrim would be&#xD;
further away than   it to me. Oh&#xD;
Captain," turning to Chris, "You will&#xD;
help me find it?"&#xD;
"Yes,idear lady, but be calm!  I&#xD;
il assist you"&#xD;
"Her name sweet friend! what was&#xD;
its"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Alice Roften," replied Mrs. St.&#xD;
Clair.&#xD;
"She lived near us in Carolina. A&#xD;
gentle, delicate thing, too frail for&#xD;
life's rough usage ! Now I must with.&#xD;
hold  other matters of importance,&#xD;
which will hear keeping. 'You need&#xD;
not bear more to-day.  Be quiet now!&#xD;
Go and rest up stairs."&#xD;
Mrs. St. Clair took Hal's hand&#xD;
affectionately. "Promise me to leave&#xD;
the rest to my time."&#xD;
"Then dear lady, I am your willing&#xD;
prisoner until all is revealed. A&#xD;
great load is rolled away. There is&#xD;
the hero who lifts the stone !"&#xD;
She advanced and caught the hand&#xD;
of the ex-scout.&#xD;
"Gratitude, endless gratitude binds&#xD;
me to you for life. It was a rough&#xD;
providence that cast me in your way."&#xD;
Her eyes looked up.&#xD;
"Thanks to Heaven for it."&#xD;
She kissed Mrs St. Clair and hastily&#xD;
retired to her room.&#xD;
An unspeakable joy thrilled her as&#xD;
she fingered the ring. The hope of&#xD;
seeing her mother's grave ravished&#xD;
her soul. Then    came    the  sting.&#xD;
Why did he farm me as a founduling'&#xD;
How is it that my foster father, Doc-&#xD;
tor Prentiss could not tell me all this?&#xD;
The dark cloud rolled in on her&#xD;
mind.   Her father was a villain! his&#xD;
misdeeds had cursed his blood.&#xD;
She shuddered, vet knew it was so.&#xD;
Then the escape from    being the ac-&#xD;
knowledged wife of Brantly whom&#xD;
she tried to humble, because of the&#xD;
error in  believing  his house had&#xD;
wronged her's,&#xD;
All rushed whelmingly and she&#xD;
sought rest in vain.&#xD;
Pearl had returned, but was kept&#xD;
in ignorance of everything.&#xD;
Mrs. St. Clair knew that Hal&#xD;
would communicate the tidings and&#xD;
so left the matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
Li&#xD;
&#xD;
A~.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SCOUT'S RIEVENGfE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The two young women nlremained in&#xD;
their room  until a late dinner hour.&#xD;
Pearl rejoiced that Hal's mind 111was&#xD;
relieved of so much sad doubt.  H1lal&#xD;
was excused from   attend iig dinner.&#xD;
All understood the cause.&#xD;
Mrs. St. Clair had revealed a part&#xD;
, of what she knew. W 'hen and how,&#xD;
could Hal reveal what the scout kiien?&#xD;
The trial had scarcely begun.&#xD;
Alone ! T' was   chest  alone. She&#xD;
slipped away to struggle with duty.&#xD;
The day had been cloie and oppres-&#xD;
sive. The fairly were renting atter&#xD;
dinner.&#xD;
Hal walked slowly to the ol mill.&#xD;
There, universal slumher seemed to&#xD;
pervade  every thing.  TIne arrow'y&#xD;
pines were motionless.   A    fw fril&#xD;
like clouds lay idly on a dark hank&#xD;
at the west, presaging rain at a later&#xD;
hour. The ducks pattered     ol the&#xD;
river bank, noising among the Weeds,&#xD;
not noticing the intruding step&#xD;
The mionotonsous plash of the drip-&#xD;
ping waste way told of an ie wheel.&#xD;
A stray kingfisher watched the shin-&#xD;
mering stream for prey.&#xD;
Behind   her  was the deep w(Old&#xD;
through  which she had pas,-ed: he re&#xD;
her the open that lay above the Ii l-,&#xD;
up to the vault of blue.&#xD;
There is rest, only ! she thought.&#xD;
Her mother was at rest: What&#xD;

see my Hal, as she used to be! Kiss&#xD;
me again."&#xD;
She drew away.&#xD;
"Dear Ruger, you mutt not press&#xD;
that old folly ! I am glad, indeed I&#xD;
am, to see you, and will get you to&#xD;
come as often as you please to the&#xD;
home of our dear friends, the St.&#xD;
Clairs, but as I told you once before,&#xD;
decidedly, you must drop that foolish&#xD;
style of endearment by w rich you&#xD;
speak to ne! will you? Promise now."&#xD;
"No miss pert; never ! You may&#xD;
will, but I won't. You are dearer&#xD;
than ever, so I've come to tell you&#xD;
what I must. You cannot escape me&#xD;
little one, so he quiet."&#xD;
"But Ruger !-."&#xD;
"But, Hal! I swore to love you&#xD;
when a boy, and you called me, noody.&#xD;
I grew to manhood and you snubbed&#xD;
me for a simpleton. Do you ihink I&#xD;
shall give my Hal up? Darling let&#xD;
me kiss you?"&#xD;
"Surely Ruger, you are soon end-&#xD;
ing a sudden visit that might be both&#xD;
pleasant and profitable. If you insist&#xD;
on such terms, I must leave you ! It&#xD;
is my duty to do so."&#xD;
She struggled to wrest her hand&#xD;
from him.&#xD;
"Foolish chick ! I said you'd love&#xD;
me some day, didn't I? So you will !&#xD;
I'll prove it Hal for just one kiss."&#xD;
"Let me go Ruger, until you are&#xD;
yourself. Must I say that you are&#xD;
offensively rude?"&#xD;
"Say what you please ! You did&#xD;
that always anyway, but have that&#xD;
kiss I will. You may make the most&#xD;
of it."&#xD;
"I shall leave you!"&#xD;
She sprang up, her resolute brown&#xD;
eyes were fixed on him.&#xD;
"You know me! I regret so much,&#xD;
that you, Ruger, would force me to so&#xD;
&#xD;
necessary  a step.   Am&#xD;
respectfully, or not?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I to he treats&#xD;

"[Hal,  if    the   fiends   f(rm&#xD;

He   is intoxicated  I  fear, The&#xD;
thought. I'll coax him.&#xD;
"Rutger ! Good Ruger."&#xD;
"Ha ! that's like two years ago. Sit&#xD;
down my darling, right close by rte:&#xD;
there ! I'll not harm you.  No ! v u&#xD;
precious jewel, you are as safe as itf&#xD;
hedged with all of Grant's bayonets!&#xD;
Sit, right, there; so.  Now let ue talk.&#xD;
lou swore once you'd never love tue.&#xD;
I laughed because I didn't believe a&#xD;
word of it.  Now for the proof! Will&#xD;
my little Hal let me kiss her?"&#xD;
"Ruger, tell me good-bye ! ('o now.&#xD;
Do not, for your peace and mine ever&#xD;
return! I swear-'tis harsh for a no -&#xD;
man to say it., that you never shall&#xD;
again speak to me as you do now. A&#xD;
a friend, an old time companion you&#xD;
are at liberty to command all I have,&#xD;
but you must learn, even if by a rv&#xD;
fusal ever to be alone with you again'&#xD;
that, you shall respect my motives it I&#xD;
am obliged to withhold them."&#xD;
She turned to leave.&#xD;
"Hal, don't go yet ! I've a story to&#xD;
tell you."&#xD;

about twenty years ago by one Pru-&#xD;

She was put at the Bentharms.&#xD;
That's right, sit down ! Ah, th"e&amp;amp;&#xD;
eyes are diamonds now      under the&#xD;

"Mars Wolf, noung Scip gone fish-&#xD;
ining yerly dis mornin, an he see a&#xD;
buckra in sorter old blue close. He&#xD;
tell me 'bout it. I gone to de mill,&#xD;
an  who you tink I see settin on de&#xD;
foot-log smoking he pipe as oncon-&#xD;
sarned as ef he didn't care wedder he&#xD;
fall in de ribber or not?"&#xD;
"Who?" asked Chris.&#xD;
"Dat denticle yankee ossifer wot&#xD;
.we capter on de Brent road, Him&#xD;
wot inarster drag off de hoss. He&#xD;
foolin roun yer to git at you boss!&#xD;
You better keep your eye skin; kase&#xD;
you did fool dem buckra dat time."&#xD;
"All right! Saddle old Rocket, I'll&#xD;
go and see him."&#xD;
As the two negroes left, old Scipio&#xD;
remarked:&#xD;
"Dat buckra better be 'spectful, or,&#xD;
I sway, Mars Chris will feed catfish&#xD;
wid em. Look yer boy ! Mars Wolf&#xD;
is de debble. He wusser dan de deb-&#xD;
ble."&#xD;
Chris rode in the direction of the&#xD;
mill, and waited there awhile. Not&#xD;
seeing anything of Ruger he thought&#xD;
to examine the machinery that had&#xD;
been hard used during the war and&#xD;
patched by inexpert hands.&#xD;
Hitching Rocket, the ex scout be-&#xD;
gan his survey. While inspectinghe&#xD;
underpinning,  waterway, pc., he&#xD;
was aware of the presence of some&#xD;
person, looking up he saw the old nil-&#xD;
&#xD;
ler whose woolly head and dusty cloth-&#xD;
ing announced his calling.&#xD;
"Old man, things are shaky aboit&#xD;
the mill. Wouldn't be well, not to turn&#xD;
on the flow until we tix up?"&#xD;
"You'se  right marster ! Deu&#xD;
sorter ranshaklin, but we kain't l&#xD;
no better. You see, dis is de only&#xD;
run of stone in forty miles rotn   \(ot&#xD;
Sherman didn't stroy. and nostiss is so&#xD;
'dulgin to de neighbors dat we got no&#xD;
time to fix up."&#xD;
The old negro's theory was, that of&#xD;
the  Irishman  told  by   Thaekeray.&#xD;
"when it rained he could not thatch.&#xD;
when it did not rain, there need not&#xD;
be a thatch."&#xD;
The several days of each week&#xD;
when the mill was shut off, the miller&#xD;
claimed to he his time. It was when&#xD;
the hopper jumped indiscriminately&#xD;
loose, the wheel wasted half of the&#xD;
water, the stones needed picking, or&#xD;
the floor gaped until a track of grist&#xD;
or meal lay on the sluggish stream,&#xD;
only at such times he argued:&#xD;
'We kain't do no better."&#xD;
"We'll see old man ! Don't pot on&#xD;
the flow again until I tell you ! It's a&#xD;
sheer waste."&#xD;
"Dat's so boss, dat's so ! I allers&#xD;
told em so, jis as you'se a talkin sir"'&#xD;
The venerable, sable miller made&#xD;
everything grits that came to nill.&#xD;
He had one guage, that was Tob's&#xD;
dictum.&#xD;
"I allers told em so."&#xD;
"No one passing to-day?" inquire3&#xD;
Chris carelessly.&#xD;
"One strange buckra man, sir.&#xD;
He's bin round yer tree or four day.&#xD;
Him   don't bodder nobody.     Talk&#xD;
sorter knowin bout we peeples. say&#xD;
he know you ! Zaminin trees for tur.&#xD;

hunter.  Hun   gone   round  h '(IC&#xD;
Bulah place half hour or so."&#xD;
&#xD;
)I&#xD;
&#xD;
Ai&#xD;
&#xD;
Chris gassed that the rosin hunter&#xD;
was Roger.&#xD;
The   Beulah  place  was IJoward&#xD;
Graham's.   Roger must he advised&#xD;
and restrained.&#xD;
Chris rode away.&#xD;
When within a mile of Beulah, he&#xD;
saw Ruger ahead of him, evidently&#xD;
toutsore, or worse, intoxicated.&#xD;
Chris rode sharp and overtook hi n.&#xD;
"Gad, Wolf! How's tnies my boy?&#xD;
Give us your paw. Haven't laid ev s&#xD;
 on 'o-, since the night you pulled the&#xD;
bacon skin."&#xD;
Chris reached o't his hand fr a&#xD;
hearty grip.&#xD;
Ruger somewhat excited by  rink&#xD;
saLzed the ex scout's right hand  ithave&#xD;
muscular pressure that voultl have&#xD;
maimed an ordinary pahm.&#xD;
' Case I didn't water go losing&#xD;

Ruger let go the hand to cut his&#xD;
tobacco plug.&#xD;
"Chew !" he offered the plug.&#xD;
'"No, I smoke too much !" replied&#xD;
-I'&#xD;
Chris.&#xD;
"I'll get down awhile; let's have a&#xD;
talk Roger."&#xD;
"Good ! would as soon talk as not;&#xD;
what's the text?"&#xD;
The rough Federal squat ted on the&#xD;
grass.&#xD;
"Hal !" replied Chris,  what are&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
The enthusiastic brother was telling&#xD;
Chris what, the listener well believed.I&#xD;
"I agree with you, Ruger, concern-N&#xD;
ing your sister, so you may depend on&#xD;
my hearty assistance in securing her&#xD;
happiness. You, however, must not&#xD;
frustrate my plans."&#xD;
"How!" asked Ruger.&#xD;
"Let Howard Graham alone ! I'll&#xD;
look after him in time."&#xD;
"Good again ! What is it you don't&#xD;
get me on? Stuart knew his man,&#xD;
Wolf, when he sent you to ride around&#xD;
at will. Now, see here! you're alll&#xD;
setting up as the bowlers have it. I&#xD;
can't let Hal's interests go amuck be-t&#xD;
cause I want to smash Howard Gra-&#xD;
ham's nose or worse perhaps. But,&#xD;
there's one thing dead sure ! I'm&#xD;
knocking around loose. Got my full&#xD;
pay."&#xD;
He flung a handful of gold on the&#xD;
grass.&#xD;
"Give that to Hal, please !"&#xD;
Don't drink more'n a feller can&#xD;
stand, and except whiskey cain live&#xD;
cheap for a year. I shall scout near&#xD;
Beulah every four months, Wolf or&#xD;
no Wolf! Gad ! If, Howard plays&#xD;
false further than he has done, he'd&#xD;
better close his affairs.&#xD;
If convenient you may so inform&#xD;
him. Tell Hal, I'll see her on Sun&#xD;
day, p. in. at the mill. Suppose now&#xD;
for sake of'old acquaintance we toast&#xD;
the Brent road."&#xD;
Ruger pulled out a flask.&#xD;
"No, thank you," replied Chris.&#xD;
"Now you'd better stop for to day."&#xD;
"Pshaw, old fel! I can down two of&#xD;
them and not feel a hair turn."&#xD;
Ruger raised the flask aloft.&#xD;
.Here'A good luck to Spangler, if?&#xD;
he is a Reb, Best regards to the St.&#xD;
Claims at they aks. Early peace and&#xD;
content to my precious Hal, and&#xD;
Wolf,-"&#xD;
He fixed a wild look on the ex scout.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Tell rmy gentle sister Pearl, that it'&#xD;
I could meet her as a gentleman, I&#xD;
would."&#xD;
He tossed off a drink.&#xD;
"So you know all!" replied ('hria.&#xD;
"Try, Ruger to give up whiskey!&#xD;
You'll soon be able to meet Pearl."&#xD;
"Can an Ethiopian change his skin&#xD;
or the leopard it's spots?  It's in n&#xD;
blood Wolf! So long   old fe! Au&#xD;
eye all round. Good-bye."&#xD;
Ruger rose and entered the forest&#xD;
regardless of where he went, evident-&#xD;
ly anxious to escape the eye of one he&#xD;
so much respected even while under&#xD;
the effects of strong drink.&#xD;
On the following Sabbath afteruno,&#xD;
Hal slipped quietly anay to keep the&#xD;
appointment. Promptly she was nwt&#xD;
at the rendezvous by Roger. He hal&#xD;
been indulging for two days past in the&#xD;
fast growing habit of drink and show-&#xD;
ed the results. His strong hand tren-&#xD;
bled as he took her's, his breath was&#xD;
reeking.&#xD;
"Ruger!" began Hal, "you surprise&#xD;
me! Indeed you'll not let an eneny&#xD;
so subtle and cruel as whiskey, unmatun&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"It's the cruel foe Hal, that is n al&#xD;
ly subtle. The manly enemy like the&#xD;
rattlesnake rings the alarm  before it&#xD;
strikes. Don't scold sweetheart! Y"u&#xD;
know I can't stand that."&#xD;
He drew her close to him.&#xD;
"You'll make Hal a promise dear&#xD;
Ruger; will you not?"&#xD;
"Let's hear the wish," he replied.&#xD;
"Not to drink another drop f;or&#xD;
year, please, for your good  and il,&#xD;
happiness."&#xD;
"Darling if anyone on earth can'&#xD;
influence me, you are the person I Lah.&#xD;
I'd cut my right hand off for you.ht,&#xD;

&#xD;
mas; a great time among the south-&#xD;
erners."&#xD;
"Christmas !" he repeated.   "I'll&#xD;
chalk that down."&#xD;
He stopped and made a pencil&#xD;
memorandum in his note book.&#xD;
"I've seen her, that's enough! Like&#xD;
the lyric to the swallows, they are a,&#xD;
'Gay and guiltless pair!&#xD;
What seek ye? ye have no need of prayer,&#xD;
No sins to be forgiven."&#xD;
&#xD;
le waved, as it were an adieu, in&#xD;
the direction they had driven.&#xD;
"Goodbye, sweet Pearl !"&#xD;
Hal was both pleased and surprised.&#xD;
"Now darling, I'll tell you fare-&#xD;
well!"&#xD;
He put his arm gently around her.&#xD;
"We may or may not meet soon&#xD;
again, but a letter addressed to Ruger&#xD;
Prentiss care of our old uncle  ."&#xD;
"What! Ruger Prentiss, who?"&#xD;
She clung to his arm.&#xD;
"Yes, sweetheart ! I am no cousin,&#xD;
but your half brother by my father's&#xD;
second marriage and Pearl is my full&#xD;
sister."&#xD;
"Pearl! Sister! You my brother?&#xD;
Ruger do not not mock me ! Tell me,&#xD;
am I hearing false or true?"&#xD;
She clasped her temples as if hold-&#xD;
ing a treasure to her mind. "Oh&#xD;
Ruger! Speak brother for Heaven's&#xD;
sake, speak!"&#xD;
"It is so sweet Hal ! She was kept by&#xD;
Mrs. St. Clair, I was taken away. I&#xD;
am not a cousin as you supposed.&#xD;
You are her senior by three years and&#xD;
mine by almost five. Old Prudence,&#xD;
and our uncle gave me the full history.&#xD;
We are of honorable birth darling,&#xD;
but we've had our fl-ther's curse to&#xD;
carry. Never mind ! Goodbye ! Go&#xD;
home and be happy with your new&#xD;
found sister. Tell her to forget all&#xD;
about me. Goodbye, goodbye !"&#xD;
He tore her from     his arms and&#xD;
printed a last kiss while she stood&#xD;
&#xD;
with streamin eyes waving farewell&#xD;
"Poor 'fellow ! 'Now for my sweet&#xD;
Pearl; my sister."&#xD;
Her nimble feet bore her swiftly&#xD;
towards home.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
THE LIGHT STUNS-DAY WI'N,.&#xD;
The continuous strain of revelatiin&#xD;
pressing one event after another, was&#xD;
fast undermining Hal's heroic nature.&#xD;
Mrs. St. Clair had     tried to guard&#xD;
against this, in withholding the re-&#xD;
lationship to Pearl.&#xD;
It was dark when Hal entered the&#xD;
house; not seeing Pearl she hastened&#xD;
to her room. There sat the unsuspect.&#xD;
ing girl waiting Hal's arrival.&#xD;
Hal rushed   to her feet, s zed her&#xD;
around the waist as she gasped, "M v&#xD;
sister ! my sister !"&#xD;
Pearl thought some sad news had&#xD;
overtaken her, as at once her mind re-&#xD;
curred to the coarse stranger.&#xD;
"Hal, dariin g! what troubles von.'&#xD;
Tell me; tell Pearl."&#xD;
She raised the bowed heal. ihe&#xD;
eyes were closed; Hal was senele s.&#xD;
Gently the poor sufferer's headwa,&#xD;
laid on the chair next to here, then&#xD;
Pearl summoned help.&#xD;
Mrs. St. Clair came in and aplilit-l&#xD;
restoratives. They had but a partial&#xD;
effect.  Hal rallied and again swoon-&#xD;
ed.&#xD;
A hot fever supervened.&#xD;
"Telegraph   for Doctor lPreunti&#xD;
She will he ill.  Send for our dolr "&#xD;
The message was carried belon : nni&#xD;
in a few minutes Rocket was 'i a run&#xD;
for the station urged h lii, mla-toO.&#xD;
Ralph rode as fast for the tismily&#xD;
physician.  The house was Ia iiitl&#xD;
still as the Doctor entere-d. Ile lvA&#xD;
his head   while he held th lpilh.&#xD;
"The brain."&#xD;
Howard Graham oscillated 1ht \ '1i&#xD;
doubts and plans.    So lo ngI iat '1: w&#xD;
&#xD;
TILE S'OU~I8IBEVN(&#xD;
&#xD;
had   elapsed  since  the  scandalous&#xD;
treachery of a marriage, '(consum-&#xD;
mated, as he afterwards said, on a&#xD;
frolic;) that, like the King of Ithaca&#xD;
at Aeolia. he felt, that, he hld the&#xD;
wind bags of favor. But more than&#xD;
curiosity was destined to rip them.&#xD;
Not a word or line had passed be-&#xD;
&#xD;
uwC-n&#xD;
after&#xD;
south,&#xD;
&#xD;
Hal and himself, since the&#xD;
his graduation-whenl he&#xD;
until about the time&#xD;
&#xD;
day&#xD;
went&#xD;
that&#xD;
&#xD;
Virginia seceded. Then, he forward-&#xD;
ed an ambiguous document, as will&#xD;
follow. His object was to get a reply,&#xD;
in which he was disappointed. IIal&#xD;
refused to reply. He thought too; she&#xD;
might see another opportunity for a&#xD;
new  match, and so improving the&#xD;
intervening war, cancel all claims&#xD;
&#xD;
against him by&#xD;
He mistook&#xD;
&#xD;
a second marriage.&#xD;
one quality in Hal.&#xD;
&#xD;
She was vivacious and animated to&#xD;
briuqueness.  This he thought to be&#xD;
fast and a want of sincerity. She's&#xD;
fine looking, and  will "catch  up"&#xD;
with some unsophisticated chap. so he&#xD;
reasoned as he folded the Pollowing.&#xD;
"The   annexed    certificate  from&#xD;
Rodman, speaks for itself: You are&#xD;
very well aware, that, the attempt to&#xD;
marry one P,'entiss to me, (whoever&#xD;

The  wily hag saw   a new way of&#xD;

cates of marriage to the controller, he&#xD;
said, or the curroner, or may he the&#xD;
sheriff! t'enny rate, he says, read this."&#xD;
"I read the durned thing, all writ&#xD;
up and stomped and waxed up! it&#xD;
didn't say nuffin, but that, Miss Hal&#xD;
was marrid, that's all."&#xD;
"You see Miss, how t'is! Jim fooled&#xD;
Ike. He didn't write all of the paper,&#xD;
at first. The last part about the name&#xD;
Prentiss, he put in after he got Ike to&#xD;
sign&#xD;
This really was the true state of the&#xD;
case, but Prudence guessed it, and&#xD;
Hal accepted it as reasonable.&#xD;
"Don't you drap    a line  to that&#xD;
worthless young villain. He wants&#xD;
you to say, Go ! No, let him go, but&#xD;
hold the rod over him."&#xD;
Prudence calculated again, that a&#xD;
fee might be had from Howard some&#xD;
day. At anyrate a big thing was&#xD;
brewing. She'd get the skimmings of&#xD;
the vat if no more.&#xD;
Hal left. Deadway with the convic-&#xD;
tion, Howard is trying to get out.&#xD;
Referring the matter to Doctor&#xD;
Prentiss, he pooh, poohed the whole&#xD;
affair.&#xD;
"It's a great pity dear Hal, that,&#xD;
you  did not consult me before that&#xD;
silly step, but if he desires to go, let&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Doctor Prentiss had grave doubts of&#xD;
his brother's first alliance.  Why&#xD;
clandestinely marry the girl only a&#xD;
day or two before leaving Carolina?&#xD;
Why keep the marriage and her early&#xD;
death a profound secret? Why kid-&#xD;
nap the child?&#xD;
He made no special eflrts to trace&#xD;
the matter, because of the preponder-&#xD;
ating proofs to sustain hims fears. For&#xD;
thib reason he permitted the children&#xD;
to believe they were orphaned cous&#xD;
ius-children of uear relatives. The&#xD;
bore the name of Amnou' and lived&#xD;
as    his    own.    ituger   spent&#xD;
&#xD;
years away at school.  Hal remiainel&#xD;
at home with her foster parent-the&#xD;
bachelor Doctor.&#xD;
Hal's chagrin grew to a degree (f&#xD;
untam+ale hatred, when subtequent1x,&#xD;
for a quick retort to the Bentharn&#xD;
(whom she remembered inebibihtoHl&#xD;
she  was reminded    that "the pert&#xD;
poult might flaunt feather- in the&#xD;
face of poor folk, but that wouinl't&#xD;
rub  out the  fact, that the St. (']hiry&#xD;
and  Brantlvs of    South  Carlina,&#xD;
wouldn't know    their own sister ""&#xD;
her deathbed, because  she'd married&#xD;
an Armour. or whatever he might hr"&#xD;
"Do you mean to say. that.    ople4&#xD;
connected with my father's wif',, re-&#xD;
fused to attend her last hours., lti.&#xD;
she was my father's wife?"&#xD;
V-al lost sight of any filial tie, in&#xD;
the desire to repel the insult t hr&#xD;
father.&#xD;
"Yes; I mean Mistres Hal to top yOu,&#xD;
what is commonly reported.     Your&#xD;
father ruined your name and hr 'nght&#xD;
misery on the last hours of as g'l i&#xD;
young wife as ever claimed  a titledi&#xD;
name and grand home.     No: kol&#xD;
your pert speeches to your-elt in&#xD;
future, and know thi if we re ' r.&#xD;
we have our shure of felhin r.&#xD;
" A h, Mrs Bentham!" replied Hab1&#xD;
"you've  opened  my eves to dayt  it&#xD;
as well to shame.  'I f rgi)e y1, it&#xD;
you'll pass by what I did not uian&#xD;
for rudeness."&#xD;
Riding away, she vowed1 with an&#xD;
uplifted hand.&#xD;
"They cast my mother out    r -iN,&#xD;
not her own.   I too am cast  it.! I&#xD;
Will pull down the ruin about al&#xD;
our hea&#xD;
S1e ' as sure her ;other hal 1 1&#xD;
neglected. She nursed the sting   I&#xD;
grew to the alder's egg. and  aO WI&#xD;
11ainy troubles.&#xD;
1 howard has tried' t  eseapm.  I 't&#xD;
give him rope awhile.''&#xD;
&#xD;
Hal plunged again into society, t10&#xD;
see or hear aught of the Branty Or&#xD;
Graham family.&#xD;
She made a trip to Europe N withith&#xD;
doctor uncle, and    at Geneva wais&#xD;
booked for a mountain drive with a&#xD;
party of southerners.&#xD;
'Leo  Braintly."   The name was&#xD;
familiarly  intoxicating.  'hic  mail&#xD;
handsome, courteous, gallant.&#xD;
She skilfully avoided him   as the&#xD;
revolving mirror avoids the ftce, only&#xD;
to return to see it still there.&#xD;
She read heedlessly at the l(t of a&#xD;
mountain   pine.   The   unbending,&#xD;
straight tree did not look more direct&#xD;
to the blue alcove  above, than  his&#xD;
fixed eyes on her averted face.&#xD;
She was always farthest from him&#xD;
where the goats browsed on t1mhe most&#xD;
ragged heights, yet his long athletic&#xD;
leaps reached her in time to) lead her&#xD;
away.&#xD;
She always begged, that he  ould&#xD;
"not desert the company for her."&#xD;
Leo agreed, that, she was the per.&#xD;
fection of beauty, but he thought, she&#xD;
is repellent. She avoid  me!  I  will&#xD;
test her for all time.&#xD;
"If you   were  on that glacier, a&#xD;
thousand feet below, (he eyed    lier&#xD;
calmly) and I should   bring  yovU a&#xD;
tried rope of rescue, you wSonI aced pt&#xD;

&#xD;
"Ready? One!"&#xD;
The report of two pistols was as one.&#xD;
Brantly stood fast until his second ad-&#xD;
dressed him.&#xD;
"He has winged you, Leo!" thrust-&#xD;
ing his finger in the coat sleeve.&#xD;
"No, guess not!  It has passed out&#xD;
of the cloth."&#xD;
The party of the other side leaning&#xD;
on his friend was slowly supported&#xD;
away.&#xD;
He carried a bullet in his right&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
From that hour, Hal placed herself&#xD;
under Brantly's care, and permitted&#xD;
"a friend's attentions," hitherto avoid&#xD;
ed. She met him not again until at&#xD;
at the Springs, then the dual conflict&#xD;
of revenge and respect clamored for&#xD;
sway. Revenge conquered.&#xD;
Howard heard from his uncle's lips&#xD;
of the marriage. Now, he thought, I&#xD;
am free! False in name, false in vow.&#xD;
The flimsy pretext he had was a&#xD;
gossamer thread.   Yet, with cruel&#xD;
audacity, and crueler falsehood he&#xD;
braved the issue.&#xD;
He strutted his room in velvet&#xD;
slippers, Eva's latest gift&#xD;
"So you've marked a day in De-&#xD;
cember for the marriage!" said the&#xD;
dapper, Mr Julian Altemont. "Dang&#xD;
it, she's stylish and can put up the&#xD;
rocks.  The old man got a cool fifty&#xD;
thousand for the cotton Sherman&#xD;
couldn't find."&#xD;
Mr Altemont depleted Howard's&#xD;
basket flask to the extent of half a&#xD;
tumbler. As he set the flask down,&#xD;
he held the glass aloft.&#xD;
"Luck, old boy!"&#xD;
A gu p was taken, and  the glass&#xD;
was posed for another sentiment.&#xD;
"May you and I live to see the&#xD;
weeds over the graves of enemies!&#xD;
By the bye, is anything more to he&#xD;
done about that little afliir with&#xD;
wolf "&#xD;
&#xD;
He put the glass down.&#xD;
"Of course ! but as he prefers the&#xD;
style of the slugger, I'll meet himl)&#xD;
with slugs. I would not hesitate a&#xD;
moment to fill 'him up with a charge&#xD;
of lowmould if he faces me."&#xD;
Howard    lit a fresh cigarette and&#xD;
stretched off at ease.&#xD;
"That lady   over at the Oaks, is&#xD;
deuced bad off' they sa) ! Had a hrain&#xD;
attack. Who is she anywa' Got a&#xD;
squint at her once in passing. Stup-&#xD;
ning, but mopish kind."&#xD;
"Don't know !" replied    Howard,&#xD;
"you  see, since  Ralph's high Bight,&#xD;
our houses don't visit.  None ot our&#xD;
folks have met since we came hone.&#xD;
Miss Crawford drove over to call on&#xD;
the  stranger, but quit in dtilwon:&#xD;
Says, she's lowbred.  Walked a av&#xD;
without saying good morning, hecaue&#xD;
allusion  was made   to the   north.&#xD;
Didn't of course take the trouble mo&#xD;
find out if she was a hired reader or&#xD;
a prospective school marm."&#xD;
Howard had not the remotest idea&#xD;
that the wind bags had a dangerous&#xD;
knife blade in close proximity t them.&#xD;
"You're awfully out, my boy. She's&#xD;
no second rate.  Narv time ! There's&#xD;
more in a step. or a set of head. than&#xD;
there is in millinery.  I'd give a lot&#xD;
to see her walk when she felt as ii' she&#xD;
was alone.. Airy, di'stng  .' haug hty,&#xD;
gentille e '" '"&#xD;
"You'd better declare on the pot!&#xD;
There's pen and ink." said Howari.&#xD;
"Funds !"  Mr. Julian    Alitennt&#xD;
was a professional soak.  He had lost&#xD;
his property by mortgages and carrel&#xD;
little for results when  he went int')&#xD;
the war.  He had a good record  a&#xD;
soldier  which  insured  him   what&#xD;
Howard had not, respect.&#xD;
"Spons! would be as well a;'le to&#xD;
starve her as any other poorer:l&#xD;
That don't take away the shine :-1m&#xD;
her whoever she is.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Well Howard, I'll stand for you at&#xD;
ten steps with Ralph, Wolf or the&#xD;
devil, and besides se- you through at&#xD;
Christmas. You'll have to anti up&#xD;
for my suit. Let's have an X now!&#xD;
Thanks; adieu ! Au Revoir."&#xD;
He bowed out, swinging a fancy&#xD;
whip as he went to his horse.&#xD;
The   lady  at the  Oaks was in&#xD;
Howard's mind, but he pictured her&#xD;
away up in Maryland.&#xD;
Hal's uncle, Doctor Prentiss reach-&#xD;
ed the Oaks four days after the tele-&#xD;
gram. The sufferer was passing the&#xD;
crisis. The family physician subject' .1&#xD;
his treatment to the opinion of the&#xD;
uncle.&#xD;
His reply was: "You have done all&#xD;
that is possible."&#xD;
Nature was contending against a&#xD;
fearful blow.&#xD;
Pearl stood leaning over the sufferer,&#xD;
watching with a sister's devotion every&#xD;
quiver of the lips or tremor of the&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
The brown eyes opened as if upon&#xD;
some far off abstraction   le pale&#xD;
lips whispered unintelligible fragments.&#xD;
the fingers opened and  closed  as if'&#xD;
grasping a restless something. Anon,&#xD;
she felt the ring. A smile played&#xD;
swiftly on the face and a tear rolled&#xD;
on her cheek.  Then ensued a doubt-&#xD;
ful pause.  The   breath  seemed  to&#xD;
cease; the body became rigid. The&#xD;
eyes stared at vacancy as the fingers&#xD;
clutched the bed   clothing. Then a&#xD;
deep sad sigh, a torrent of tears, and&#xD;
a whispering of wildest incoherences.&#xD;
"Let the sunlight in ! Make all&#xD;
cheerful," said the uncle, "it's a fight&#xD;
for life now."&#xD;
A few hours will see the victory of&#xD;
nature or Hal a lunatic forever."&#xD;
He   sat feeling the  pulse. Tle&#xD;
afternoon was one of those soft periods&#xD;
so well styled, the Indian summer. A&#xD;
faintest west wind rustled in the great&#xD;
&#xD;
oaks.  A  noble singer, who' lhom''e&#xD;
was near Hat's wiilndow, on a 1,&#xD;
bough, opened his throat with all f a&#xD;
nm'kingb-ird's lustine ss. The even.&#xD;
ing sun slanted chee'rfullyi athwart  e&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
Pearl called the Doctor',;m aitt ''toin&#xD;
to the tears that flowed  freely  while&#xD;
Ilal seemed to breathe more quietly.&#xD;
The uncle bathed    her face  ;hi a&#xD;
delicate aromati'.  l'earl leaned  geve&#xD;
to kiss her lips, when the hrown e' es&#xD;
opened with a smile.&#xD;
"Sister."&#xD;
The voice was very fIint as he'&#xD;
fingers closed on  l'eaIl's hand , an(&#xD;
the tears ran fast.&#xD;
The doctor prepacu a sli ht stint'-&#xD;
lant and put it t(, her hips: she ( :ek.&#xD;
"(ood girl! You'll rally soon&#xD;
"Papa !&#xD;
She looked in her uncle's  'e.&#xD;
''Yes, hial ! hut quiet love.'&#xD;
The eyes cl. 'd, the tra ra.  Il e&#xD;

The two shook hands warmly. In&#xD;
reply to the inquiry, "How is your&#xD;
patient ?" he said, "she is fearfully re-&#xD;
duced, but the worst is past."&#xD;
"She has had enough Doctor to&#xD;
bumble a stout man. Nothing but&#xD;
Hal'strue grit could have sustained&#xD;
her as it did. The worst of the&#xD;
disease is over, and so is the worst of&#xD;
the cause."&#xD;
The ex-scout spoke as if to himself.&#xD;
"I am delighted to hear that. I had&#xD;
feared t'was only begun," said the&#xD;
Doctor.&#xD;
"No! with her it begun years ago&#xD;
It developed only recently."&#xD;
"You'll give me a sketch of the&#xD;
affair ! please"&#xD;
The Doctor sat on the saw bench.&#xD;
Chris touched incidentally on Hal's&#xD;
marriage and   Howard's desertion.&#xD;
Then referring to the misapprehension&#xD;
on her mind respecting the Brantlys&#xD;
and St. Clairs, related the second mar-&#xD;
riage to Leo Brantly.&#xD;
The Doctor was astounded!&#xD;
"Her stepmother's brother?" he ex-&#xD;
claimed.&#xD;
"Yes, but she did not know who&#xD;
she was, so that she could not know&#xD;
the connexion with him."&#xD;
Then he related as to the scene at&#xD;
the springs, Brantly's dejection and&#xD;
alf-imposed expatriation, the ride on&#xD;
the Brent road, the capture; Ike's part&#xD;
in the drama, and the scene at the&#xD;
Benthams. How     he suspected  her&#xD;
identity, and so placed her where she&#xD;
is. Finally, he recounted Mrs. St.&#xD;
Clair's revelation of Hal's parentage.&#xD;
"The first union of her father was&#xD;
not illicit?" asked the Doctor eagerly&#xD;
"She is of as honorable marriage a&#xD;
wa ever coutractd," replied Spang&#xD;
ler.&#xD;
&#xD;
''Then, am  I largely to blame&#xD;
I refused her the name of Prentiss&#xD;
&#xD;
fearing that my brother had w-: onnged&#xD;
her mother.   This no doubt fixed the&#xD;
suspicion on her sensitive mind ail&#xD;
stirred  those fires of revenge I~ "&#xD;
Hal ! I rejoice in your delivery from&#xD;
a cloud of obscure birth "&#xD;
"Why   Doctor,"   said  Chris w; ith&#xD;
pride, "She is Pearl's half' sister."&#xD;
"WX hat ! the pretty thing up stair,"&#xD;
"Yes, she   is the  daughter of \Our&#xD;
brother's second wife. Ruger i  the&#xD;
son."&#xD;
"What revelations . both sul auol&#xD;
gratifying. And you dear sir : our&#xD;
wholesome dread, have unearthed all&#xD;
this?  Forgive my evasivenese a een&#xD;
in a past interview.  We son-tin--&#xD;
sacrifice  a little to  save iuth. I&#xD;
wanted to shield   F 1, even when I&#xD;
condemned her rashnt.      .&#xD;
"That's all right Doctor. D,,n't let&#xD;
the past ever worry you.  Let u ti-v&#xD;
for a brighter future   Let mue know&#xD;
how she gets on please."&#xD;
The doctor returned    to the room.&#xD;
Hal still slept.&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
her nativity and Pearl would ac-&#xD;
company the party as a generally ad-&#xD;
mitted sine qua non.&#xD;
Chris and Scipio set about putting a&#xD;
covered wagon in order for the uses of&#xD;
a commissary and A. Q. M. equip-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
The tall, bow spring family car-&#xD;
riage too, was made ready for the&#xD;
jaunt.&#xD;
Six  weeks rolled  by. Hal was&#xD;
quite restored, then a day was set&#xD;
for the departure of the party.&#xD;
Phoebe, a Letty maid of fourteen,&#xD;
conspicuous for an ample head of&#xD;
combed   and  greased  hair [Scipio&#xD;
vowed the scizzors against plaits]&#xD;
and profuse in a much starched home&#xD;
spun plaid, annoyed her father fre-&#xD;
quently as she cautioned him.&#xD;
"Mistiss say, you muss put dis yer,&#xD;
and dat dere, an   ."&#xD;
"Look yer gal," returned Scip;&#xD;
"Mistiss doan't send sich fool mes-&#xD;
sge to me. Mistiss know I gwine to&#xD;
do exerting right. Ef you gwine to let&#xD;
little bit ob bile flour stick you mout&#xD;
out arter me same is you frock skirt,&#xD;
I'll send you back to de nigger house&#xD;
and put Chloey in you place."&#xD;
"But papy," returned the pouting&#xD;
'NPoebe.&#xD;
"Shet up yer mout; shet em up, you&#xD;
imprunce. Gal, I hain't bin four year&#xD;
in Ferginny for nuttin. Bejunce das&#xD;
de law, bejunce; don't bodder long&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Chris laughed as Scip fastened up&#xD;
the breast straps, Phoebe walked off&#xD;
muttering at the military tyranny of&#xD;
her "papy."&#xD;
"Lor hab mussyl, Mars Chris, de&#xD;
carriage want paint. Look yer, de&#xD;
hound rampang-     ."&#xD;
"What is that french, Scip? Say it&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"Chris was carefully looking to the&#xD;
&#xD;
harness. The war had been hard on&#xD;
every material.&#xD;
"You does mek fun too much Mars&#xD;
Chris; lemme told yer.&#xD;
Dat picter on de panel useter he a&#xD;
dog rearing up. It mean, one oh de&#xD;
hounds ob old General St Clair, (my&#xD;
marster's grand fader), one time see&#xD;
fire in de house, wen de famhlv was&#xD;
all sleepin, and de dog rear up aging&#xD;
de door and howl till all wake up and&#xD;
come out fore de house did hun up.&#xD;
"Yes, I understand now," returned&#xD;
the ex-scout.&#xD;
"Oh hebben, Mars    Chris, dis is a&#xD;
great old carriage. 'Twas brand new&#xD;
de night Marster was married, I'se a&#xD;
tellin yer.&#xD;
We wus all on de boxes waitin for&#xD;
de minister to say  amen, in  de old&#xD;
Colleton brick church.  'Twas (hrist-&#xD;
mas time, de bosses was cold and I&#xD;
knowed dem niggers would all try to&#xD;
git to de front step  first, to let den&#xD;
own people be de  yeerliest to meet&#xD;
Marster and de bride. So I telP&#xD;
Harkle my step boy, doau't wait for&#xD;
me to say whoa: you get de door open&#xD;
and steps out by time I haul up. Well&#xD;
sar, Marster and Mistiss git in di same&#xD;
carriage"&#xD;
He slapped the wheel to verity the&#xD;
fact.&#xD;
"Marster say, all right Scip: one&#xD;
minnit more and I was gone.   Did 't&#xD;
dem bays put it down?   Harkies look&#xD;
behind and dere was a line  most a&#xD;
mile long, buggies, carriages. gigs, dog-&#xD;
carts, and horses under saddle. De&#xD;
niggers had set fire stands long de&#xD;
road to luminate.  Ebery nigger in&#xD;
Colleton lub my marster and mistiss.&#xD;
We crashed by; de diggers dance&#xD;
for joy as dey see us agwine.&#xD;
&#xD;
Some of de buggies cut by a&#xD;
way, kase dem knowed my top&#xD;
was too high for de low limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
'twon't no use.   I was a trabelwiin;&#xD;
yes sar, I was a gaining.&#xD;
De front gate was open; up de ath'-&#xD;
nue, all long teenn de oak was lirht-&#xD;
wool fires.  Up to deh ig ton i te&#xD;
wen I hauled up I yered de ,teps fIa l&#xD;
and War war Harkles a grinning.&#xD;
I was lere fust by   tree  or fPre&#xD;
lengths.  As Mistiss get out, lie a\',&#xD;
"Sci io!"&#xD;
The tears ran from   the  ex-lave's&#xD;
&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"Ilean Ober and  say, my  mi-ti-&#xD;
She put dis yer watch in m ohand&#xD;
He pulled out a large, silver huii-&#xD;
ing lever and showed it to (Chris.&#xD;
--Yes, Mars Chris, dat same ninti ss&#xD;
yonder, in de door. Lonr bless moy&#xD;
muddei-, my mistiss! She aim a wid-&#xD;
der lady now, but ef Scip hbber de-&#xD;
sart her, kase him  is a free nigger,&#xD;
may dis watch stop  he ticken   and&#xD;
please de Master, may my heart .top&#xD;
he beaten."&#xD;
The negro put up the watch.&#xD;
"De carriage is good  and siroing&#xD;
but he  want paint.   Well dem1  is&#xD;
coming, I must git on de box.''&#xD;
All were seated.  Little 5ei(p dirve&#xD;
the wagon behind. Ralph rode w iti&#xD;
the ladies. Chris was mounted n'0&#xD;
old Rocket.&#xD;
The journey would ocenpy one day&#xD;
to the Savannah river, and at leat&#xD;
two to the   Colletoil place; so, the&#xD;
orders were to let the horses (10 their&#xD;
best.&#xD;
The precaution of a tent, 'vas s1&#xD;
part of the foresight of the re'ictmir&#xD;
soldier, as also cooking utensils and t&#xD;
supply of provisions for ten days, e(&#xD;

Zell and Videau ran freely attst&#xD;
pointing  here  and  there, while mn&#xD;
occasional shot by one of the gentle&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
Old Seaflower is done lay up, and Scip&#xD;
will soon follow my old boss."&#xD;
The tears ran down the honest&#xD;
black face.&#xD;
"I can't sing much now, Mars&#xD;
Ralph."&#xD;
"Ki, papy! enty me yeddy you last&#xD;
night, singing  myself.  How   you&#xD;
say-?"&#xD;
"Shet up, you tarmagin! Shet you&#xD;
mout. Who ax you to talk?"&#xD;
Scipio's, adness vanished as soon as&#xD;
his presu ,tive young one reminded'&#xD;
him of his abilities. She might jab-&#xD;
ber as much as she pleased in the&#xD;
cabin, where loquacity was a part of&#xD;
the elementary training of young&#xD;
negroes, but when in the presence of&#xD;
her superiors, especially when he, the&#xD;
father was the party addressed, any&#xD;
forwardness was squelched indignantly.&#xD;
Phoebe chuckled quietly, knowing&#xD;
that the noise of the rebuff was the&#xD;
greater part of the danger.&#xD;
"Phoebe tells the truth ! You sing&#xD;
very well.-,What was the favorite&#xD;
boat song? Daniel wasn't it?"&#xD;
"Dat chune, Mars Chris, put me in&#xD;
membrance ob a great time we had&#xD;
jis afo nisties git married."&#xD;
Ralph nudged Chris. "He'll go&#xD;
back on pedigree now. He's the most&#xD;
aristocratic old negro in the South."&#xD;
"We was coming from Charlestown&#xD;
to de home place in ole Seaflower,&#xD;
and marster, you fadder Mars Ralph,&#xD;
had mistiss and a young gempleman&#xD;
from de nor'ard wid him in de bote."&#xD;
Chris moved close to Scipio, under&#xD;
pretense of re-lighting his pipe.&#xD;
"Marster call for Daniel ! He say,&#xD;
Scipio must lead!1 I call for Hannible.&#xD;
De gempleman larf arter me, and I&#xD;
didn't like it. Ennyhow ! I'se yer&#xD;
to-day. Me doan know way him is!&#xD;
We come a bilin to do plantashun,&#xD;
and  arter dat master always like&#xD;
Daniel chune."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why did you get vexed, Sipio.&#xD;
asked Pearl.&#xD;
"Case missy, our peeple all hab re.&#xD;
spect for de black folk, efdenm is&#xD;
black.  We hain't got no eddicatipo&#xD;
and de hair is short like de wits, but&#xD;
we'se got feelings."&#xD;
"Oh he didn't mean to offend,Rcip,"&#xD;
replied Pearl.&#xD;
"Missy, I keep my eye on dat buek.&#xD;
ra. He nebber come to enny good.&#xD;
No ma'am, him too triflin like. \Vhy&#xD;
ma'am he trifle wid Miss       ."&#xD;
Chris whispered, "Stop!"&#xD;
"Dat lef hand mule is tarnily gittin&#xD;
loose! I nebber see sich a greeter."&#xD;
Scipio knew there was a wherefore&#xD;
for "stop." So he desired an ingen-&#xD;
ious excuse for holding up.&#xD;
Pearl thought the "trifling," might&#xD;
be too plainly expressed by the nerro,&#xD;
who often transgressed proprieties un-&#xD;
wittingly because of a lack of speech,&#xD;
so she dropped the subject.&#xD;
The next evening the party drove&#xD;
by "Honerhill "&#xD;
Chris and Ralph surveyed the hard&#xD;
fought field.&#xD;
"Our boys did not have the num-&#xD;
hers which they engaged." remarked&#xD;
Ralph, "but it was good fighting,.'&#xD;
"Jenkins was the geniusof the day.&#xD;
He once lifted one of his men on his&#xD;
shoulder close under fire, and carried&#xD;
the poor wounded fellow off. I'm told.&#xD;
He got Hartwell's cap on this field&#xD;
after the yankees retreated.&#xD;
The party camped     near Csaw-&#xD;
hatchie, in sight of memorable "Tul.&#xD;
lifinny," where another night w,9-&#xD;
pleasantly passed.&#xD;
The ladies occupying the tent with&#xD;
Phoebe in a snug corner. Chris and -&#xD;
Ralph on the carriage cushions hefbre&#xD;
a smart fire, and Scipio snoring under&#xD;
the wagon in his ample blanket.&#xD;
Another early start was made Nov&#xD;
they pass "Pocotaligo." where Eliot&#xD;

the  Salkehatchie, then   the driveI&#xD;
verged east towards the main land in f&#xD;
Colleton.&#xD;
As afternoon set in, Scipio from his&#xD;
carriage box saw the familiar outlines&#xD;
of fields and forest.&#xD;
The negro's love   of home and&#xD;
locality caused a profound silence to&#xD;
possess him.&#xD;
"Home in sight yet?" asked I-al ph&#xD;
from the inside.&#xD;
Chris was riding close along side.&#xD;
"Ah, Mars Ralph ! you kin jedge&#xD;
for yourself, boss! Lemnie tell Mars&#xD;
Chris, bout old home."&#xD;
Scipio in emergencies fled to his&#xD;
plug of honey dew. He whacked off&#xD;
a chew to keep the sad flow of thought&#xD;
under.&#xD;
"Well, yer we is on (le line o (de&#xD;
Berkeley track ! Jis yer, sir, is way&#xD;
my old boss had a standhfor a buck-&#xD;
a cute old coon, wot used to run phmn&#xD;

He waited on he hoss wen de dogs&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
couldn't git a drink from de old well,&#xD;
but lets go on."&#xD;
He climbed hack to the carriage&#xD;
box.&#xD;
When he drew rein again the river&#xD;
flowed brightly in sight, fringed with&#xD;
fresh marsh.&#xD;
The tide rippled sparkling under a&#xD;
soft wind. A few trees left by the&#xD;
vandal hands rustled a sad welcome.&#xD;
A pile of debris showed where the&#xD;
old chimneys once stood. A twisted&#xD;
iron rail indicated the front step.&#xD;
A fragment or two of marble peered&#xD;
out from the ashen heap. This was&#xD;
all there was left )f "Brantly Hall."&#xD;
Ralph handed the ladies out then&#xD;
strolled to the cemetery near by.&#xD;
While he and Pearl went arm in&#xD;
arm through the sacred ground, now&#xD;
overrun with scrub growth and weeds,&#xD;
Hal was conning names that seemed&#xD;
familiar as she read them on the&#xD;
stones.&#xD;
Chris had the tent pitched while&#xD;
the negroes proceeded to look after&#xD;
the horses and supper.&#xD;
"Scip," said Chris, "you came very&#xD;
near letting a cat out. You began to&#xD;
tell about that young man night be-&#xD;
fore last; whtt's his name?"&#xD;
"Who sar? Mars Eugene Prentiss."&#xD;
"Yes; he was a near relation of Miss&#xD;
Hal."&#xD;
"Well, well! I'se so glad you stop&#xD;
me. I wouldn't hab hurt Miss Hal's&#xD;
feelings for de wuld. So him is some&#xD;
kin to Miss Hal?"&#xD;
"Do you remember who he married&#xD;
Scip, when he came here?"&#xD;
"Yaas sari  My soul, didn't him&#xD;
marry Miss Alice Rofton. She war a&#xD;
purty noting lady, and lib bout tree&#xD;
mile ober by de club house."&#xD;
"Had she any relatives that, you&#xD;
remember?" asked Chris.&#xD;
"Only old Mr Rofton, him fadder&#xD;
Do old genpleman stay yer wenl de&#xD;
&#xD;
yankee come. He say, he ain't gwineK&#xD;
to lebe him wire and Miss Alice&#xD;
grabe."&#xD;
A calm, pleasant evening a id nigt&#xD;
was spent. It was again "at home"&#xD;
to Ralph. He was too     hrave an]&#xD;
magnanimous    to repine   or ;peak&#xD;
harshly of the  outrages seen anmt&#xD;
him.&#xD;
As General Shields said to a C1-&#xD;
onel commanding a volunteer rej.&#xD;
ment, on bidding him  adieu:-Wa&#xD;
Colonel is rough, very rough. Colonel,&#xD;
Colonel, it is rougher than nio-t men&#xD;
dream of."&#xD;
Ralph repeated the indemi, auul&#xD;
looking about cheerfully, reiterated1,&#xD;
"very rough."&#xD;
Next morning, by    an  agreemeit&#xD;
with Chris, Ralph took the lade  ' out&#xD;
to fish.&#xD;
Chris was soon after seen riding&#xD;
over on the Club   house  road. He&#xD;
reached a poor cottage with  a cliay&#xD;
chimney. A flock of martin tlew in&#xD;
and out of a large gourd which -wung&#xD;
from an oak stick nailed to the r()t.&#xD;
A shabby clapboard railing eneluHed&#xD;
a little  vegetable garden. An 1M(&#xD;
bench, whitened by the weather. st')l&#xD;
at the front door, which swung on&#xD;
leather straps. Snarling from  u ler,&#xD;
the house was a mean cur, which re-&#xD;
treated as the horseman approa'hi ul.&#xD;
just as -a cock flew to the garden pal-&#xD;
ing to announce a visitor. De nationn&#xD;
and poverty were seen everywhere.&#xD;
"Hallo!" said Chris. striking the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"You'd better light, if tis  nlv to&#xD;
have a gourd    of water, stranger.&#xD;
Can't ofler anything else for  you or&#xD;
your horse."&#xD;
An olk, decrepit man appeare- in&#xD;
the doorway.&#xD;
Chris thanked the old man anld is&#xD;
mounted. He accepted the hospitbihle&#xD;

L&#xD;
.C&#xD;
&#xD;
tender of water and enjoyed it from&#xD;
the cool, if coarse vessel.&#xD;
"Mr Rofton, I believe," said Chris,&#xD;
occupying the bench.&#xD;
"\ell stranger, I was held as that&#xD;
once, twenty-five years ago, when ladies&#xD;
and gentlemen were in these uirt ,&#xD;
but old Rofton, is all I expect now.&#xD;
Old and poor.&#xD;
The old man took a seat at the end&#xD;
of the bench.&#xD;
"You remember the St 'Clairs and&#xD;
Brantlys of course?"&#xD;
I'd he a renegade to gratitude it '&#xD;
did not. They were my kindest neigh-&#xD;
bors!  Rich,  b'.t friendly. Aristo-&#xD;
cratic, but never did they dilpnarage&#xD;
an honest name.  Mrs St ('lair, the&#xD;
widow, was as queenly a wife as I&#xD;
ever met. Is she well?"&#xD;
"Excellently well, I thank    you!&#xD;
She'll re occupy  her lands soon, I&#xD;
expect."&#xD;
"Then, old Rofton will nlot peri'h&#xD;
for   bread.   No,    she   is   to&#xD;
free handed even to the   poor. (hi,&#xD;
that the land was full of such gentle&#xD;
women."&#xD;
"Now, old gentleman, I want yo m&#xD;
to regard me as a friend, a nd tell me&#xD;
something about y our daughter's mar&#xD;
riage."&#xD;
Chris pulled ont he i pipe.&#xD;
The old man rose tremblingly, as&#xD;
he pointed across the road to a p'n.of&#xD;
oak  poles  that enclosed a grave.&#xD;
Faing Chris, the wrinkled face q uiv-&#xD;
ered as great tears ran   dow\ n the&#xD;
channels phmghed by sorrow.&#xD;
"That is all of her marriage to mie,&#xD;
and this:-"&#xD;
He struck his breast.&#xD;
"Death."&#xD;
He gazed through his tears a he&#xD;
asked:&#xD;
"Did you know    the  villain that&#xD;
broke her heart, and afterwards stole&#xD;
her child?"&#xD;

&#xD;
My Alice was nineteen. A pretty&#xD;
brunette, devoted, pious and guileless.&#xD;
I feared the tinsel of city style, yet,&#xD;
he seemed so respectful. My poor&#xD;
wife was unsuspicious.&#xD;
He was handsome. He stole my&#xD;
child's love.&#xD;
Orly a few days before he left, she&#xD;
consented  to an  engagement. He&#xD;
called for her to ride on the day be-&#xD;
fore his departure and urging her to&#xD;
4    marry, he promised an early return&#xD;
with his parent's consent.&#xD;
She was an innocent, confiding&#xD;
child.. They went to the house of an&#xD;
itinerant preacher and there were&#xD;
marred. They returned home next&#xD;
day. What could I do?&#xD;
It wP9 too late. I made the best of&#xD;
it. The villain never returned; the&#xD;
devil! My child pined away. Day&#xD;
after day her cheeks grew whiter.&#xD;
She sat for hours looking out upon&#xD;
the.road. No letter, no husband! A t&#xD;
last she fell ill; a child was born to&#xD;
ler. She died before seeing it.&#xD;
There is the grave! Sweet sacrifice&#xD;
t3 misplaced love.&#xD;
Mrs. St. Clair, dear lady, prepared&#xD;
her for the coffin, and at my request&#xD;
took her ring.&#xD;
The child grew to be a little prat.&#xD;
tling thing of near two years.&#xD;
She was stolen from us, how; I can&#xD;
hardly tell; but I think by a strolling&#xD;
gang of gypsies, one of whom came&#xD;
about us Sveral times.&#xD;
We pui'neI the baud. This par-&#xD;
ticuolr woman had gone-they said;&#xD;
by s8amer from the next river land-&#xD;
ie then, my poor wife followed,&#xD;
and here I am waiting. Ah sir, he&#xD;
wrought ruin in my poor house! May&#xD;
hi portion be better than mine, is all&#xD;
Cris gave the old man a package&#xD;
of tobacco and a little change which&#xD;
&#xD;
he had, then shaking hands left him,&#xD;
saying, "I will see you soon and bring&#xD;
a few friends to cheer you up."&#xD;
"You are very kind sir indeed: I&#xD;
am so much among the deer and&#xD;
negroes, that, I feel far out of the&#xD;
world. It carries me though nearer&#xD;
to Heaven, I trust."&#xD;
The ex scout rode   away with a&#xD;
cheery whistle.&#xD;
Reaching Ralph and the ladies he&#xD;
felt that every  moment now was&#xD;
golden to Hal.&#xD;
He requested Ralph to ride with&#xD;
him to Leo Brantly's plantation to&#xD;
inspect it. By dinner time he had&#xD;
surveyed the tract and was prepared&#xD;
to report to the owner. After dinner,&#xD;
having given Ralph the hint, the&#xD;
party drove over to the Rofton hut:&#xD;
Chris in the lead.&#xD;
"Here is a relic of the war," sail&#xD;
Hal sadly, looking ahead at the shab-&#xD;
by hut.&#xD;
"The low country of Carolina has&#xD;
suffered greatly."&#xD;
Chris handed the ladies out, as they&#xD;
moved away he said to Ralph, "take&#xD;
Pearl aside, but be near enough to&#xD;
hear a call."&#xD;
He then motioned to Scipio to drive&#xD;
on.&#xD;
Stepping to Hal's side he said:&#xD;
/-This old gentleman will tell you of&#xD;
your mother, Hal !"&#xD;
- He spoke commandingly.&#xD;
She was blanched    as if ill and&#xD;
trembled in every limb.&#xD;
"Be a woman, Hal ! May I leave&#xD;
you to the test?"&#xD;
Her brave, brown eves responded&#xD;
proudly to his searching look, as she&#xD;
replied, "Yes, you may."&#xD;
Chris turned away, then looking&#xD;
back as if to re assure her, said, All&#xD;
right! I leave you," then moved off.&#xD;
The old man had been weeding his&#xD;
small garden spot. While there, oh-&#xD;

&#xD;
Socially our ways were far apart as&#xD;
they c mmanded the first society, but&#xD;
had it not been for my notions of&#xD;
independence, they would have over-&#xD;
stepped conventionalism to meet me&#xD;
on my plane. Ah, fine stock that !&#xD;
A kind greeting was invariablyEleft&#xD;
at my door.  How is Mrs. St. Clair?&#xD;
Well I hope; and Leo, her brother?"&#xD;
The latter name came as a knell&#xD;
Hal's breast.&#xD;
"Thank   you sir ! They are well,&#xD;
and may return here soon. Tha is,&#xD;
after Ralph has made things con'-&#xD;
fortable."&#xD;
&#xD;
serving the dispersed party and the&#xD;
carriage he tottered slowly out on the&#xD;
road  towards the   victors.  He en-&#xD;
countered Hal. A pang of comniisera-&#xD;
tion shot through her as she saw the&#xD;
poor, patched   garments which the&#xD;
aged man    wore.  He raised his hat&#xD;
politely, at the moment Hal took his&#xD;
disengaged hand, saying, "be seatel&#xD;
sir ! You seem to be feeble."&#xD;
"Heaven bless you, lady ! Such&#xD;
considerate  words are like  angels'&#xD;
visits.  Yes, I can't get around niuch&#xD;
now; the   old  bench will bear me&#xD;
awhile yet ! It's the worse for time&#xD;
too. You sit first; there-."&#xD;
Hal took his hand tenderly. The&#xD;
dim eyes lit with surprise and pleasure.&#xD;
"' ou are with the party yonder?  I&#xD;
see the gentleman who was here this&#xD;
morning, hut I forgot to get his name.&#xD;
Memory like the sun fades at night."&#xD;
"Captain Spangler !" replied Hal.&#xD;
"Yes sir, we are friends on a visit to&#xD;
Brantly Hall, and I -, I am seeking&#xD;
information."  The  tremulous vaic&#xD;
caused Mr. Rofton to look up. "Cap-&#xD;
tain Spangler tells me, that you know&#xD;
the St Clairs and Brantlys," began&#xD;
Hal.&#xD;
"They were to me before the war,&#xD;

"Directly ! That is a bi g palrt of an&#xD;

"'Pray, do not tax your ,treng th!&#xD;

his hand in hers.&#xD;

We crawl for it as the Monk up the&#xD;
stony basilic!  We bleed for it as the&#xD;
patriots in Virginia; but where ! Oh&#xD;
where is it found? There is but one&#xD;
place of peace."&#xD;
He pointed to the ground at their&#xD;
teet.&#xD;
"There is a truce to life's sad drama !&#xD;
There is peace."&#xD;
"My dear sir! your loneliness has&#xD;
saddened  you   much  beyond  that&#xD;
reserve which your education, I may&#xD;
say religion calls on you to rally upon.&#xD;
There is a peace, that this world gives&#xD;
not, would you lose it to be rid of&#xD;
your past experience?" enquired Hal&#xD;
sweetly.&#xD;
The old man shook his head. Draw-&#xD;
ing a soiled colored handkerchief out&#xD;
of hisbreast he wiped the tears away.&#xD;
"No! You are right, sweet lady!&#xD;
You are right. But then, the billows!&#xD;
Yes, all of them,have swept over me "&#xD;
He sobbed bitterly.&#xD;
Hal waited until the paroxysm had&#xD;
passed.&#xD;
"You lived here before the war?"&#xD;
she asked.&#xD;
"Yes Madam! I had my little all,&#xD;
around here, and here I want to die."&#xD;
"Kindly tell me, dear sir, about a&#xD;
lady named Alice Rofton? She was&#xD;
said to have married a relative of&#xD;
mine.&#xD;
Hal was content with nothing but&#xD;
irrefragable proof of her legitimacy.&#xD;
She feared, at times, that, Mrs St&#xD;
Clair may have been deceived.&#xD;
"Then Madam, for the sake of your&#xD;
peace, you had better not ask any-&#xD;
thing of me. You a relative of the&#xD;
man she married? Iam a relative of&#xD;
the Alice he injured. Please don't&#xD;
grow pale and angry; I am an honest&#xD;
man and of an honest family. I do&#xD;
not want even to see, hear or think of&#xD;
anything connected with that man.&#xD;
Forgive me, if I sin."&#xD;
&#xD;
He lifted his cramped finger, to th4&#xD;
attitude of a petition.&#xD;
,-He-was a villain          .&#xD;
Hal trembled under the unbering&#xD;
denunciation, and   thought, the (u'rse&#xD;
still follows.&#xD;
"But if I tell you, he has one to&#xD;
his last accoutn t.  He   sill  wrng&#xD;
your family no more,' returned Hal&#xD;
"So, then I am dumb! The dead are&#xD;
safe with me."&#xD;
The old man folded his hands ancross&#xD;
his knee.&#xD;
"Tell me then about Alice and her&#xD;
baby."&#xD;
Hal looked eagerly upoin the (uir.-&#xD;
ering form.&#xD;
"It's many a day lady, since I ,aw&#xD;
Alice walking, but if ever a \niiau&#xD;
moved like a princess she did. You&#xD;
are just about her height. She was&#xD;
not so  troug as you are-her eyes&#xD;
oh, it's because I haven't .-een&#xD;
a fair face so long.  I think N ours are&#xD;
much like hers.  Perhaps Mis Pearl&#xD;
is like her too.  At any rate, ie was&#xD;
a pretty thing.   That,     , I Baid,&#xD;
the dead are safe, so he shall he. le&#xD;
married her, deserted her.))&#xD;
Hal clutched the bench.&#xD;
"Worse, the   monster, when   her&#xD;
child was a cheerful toddler abunt us.&#xD;
all we had   to live  for, sent and&#xD;
kidnapped her."&#xD;
Hal's face was averted.&#xD;
And Alice died?" asked Hal, in&#xD;
agony of soul.&#xD;
"No, she was dead, died as she gave&#xD;
birth to the babe. Sweet, dearest&#xD;
Alice, she never saw the child."&#xD;
"Oh sir ! I feel so much for her&#xD;
suffering parents ! May I speak to&#xD;
them?"&#xD;
"Lady, you are speaking to Alice's&#xD;
father."&#xD;
With a wild scream Hal clasped&#xD;
the old man's neck.&#xD;
"I am Alice's lost child !"&#xD;

THE SCOUT's IREVENG F&#xD;
&#xD;
Chris saw the embrace and walked&#xD;
around the carriage to hide his feel-&#xD;
ings.&#xD;
Ralph and Pearl among the fox-&#xD;
tails, saw the old man's thee as it peered&#xD;
in Hal's, they thought it too ,acred a&#xD;
season yet todisturb.&#xD;
"Alice's child ! My Alice's baby?"&#xD;
He   pushed  the  beautiful  head&#xD;
away at arm's length and with wild,&#xD;
impassioned stare, repeated:&#xD;
"Alice's child?"&#xD;
"Yes, grandfather ! I am Hal Pren-&#xD;
tiss ! I am the stolen one. Put your&#xD;
dear old head on my bosom and tell&#xD;
me, tell your Alice's child, that you've&#xD;
found peace."&#xD;
She drew the head with its thin&#xD;
gray hairs to her beating brea-t. The&#xD;
long, scattered, white locks mingled&#xD;
in her brown tresses like the drifting&#xD;
snow flakes, on the peaceful slopes of&#xD;
Lebanon's Valley.&#xD;
He gasped. and sprang back as he&#xD;
took her hand. His large gray eyes&#xD;
dilated wildly as he held her at arm's&#xD;
length.&#xD;
"They   will steal   Alice's baby&#xD;
again !"&#xD;
He seized her with both hands.&#xD;
"Come by beautiful Alice's child !"&#xD;
The old man drew her after him.&#xD;
They crossed the road. He still held&#xD;
her hand as they stood at the little&#xD;
enclosure of oak poles. Releasing one&#xD;
hand as if fearingto lose her, he pull-&#xD;
ed down a panel. They passed in.&#xD;
She looked at the clean, evenly&#xD;
dressed grave A moss rose hush par-&#xD;
tially hid a very small, discolored&#xD;
head stone.&#xD;
"Alice."&#xD;
Hal read the inscription, and fell&#xD;
prone upon the grave. Her lips were&#xD;
pressed  to the stone, as her white&#xD;
hands embraced the    mound above&#xD;
her mother.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
The old man's eyes were riveted&#xD;
Wildly on the prostrate form.&#xD;
('hris moved up. Pearl and Ralph&#xD;
also drew   mar. The    ohi man !aw&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"I1 a, lalph  you  splendid  hov!&#xD;
Pearl is that Nou?  And there is the&#xD;
gentlenmani who gave ie the Ilonlley&#xD;

lalph passed his arm through that&#xD;
of the o1ld mal, who shook in every&#xD;
fibre of his aged frame.&#xD;
"Hush ! Not a word. They stole&#xD;
her once  She'si hiding for fear they'll&#xD;
see her again."&#xD;
He pointed to Hal.&#xD;
""That's Alice's baby ! My  Alice!&#xD;
IHal ph, you've played many a time&#xD;
with her at jackstones ! Wasn't, she&#xD;
pretty? That's Alice's baby !'&#xD;
The old man knelt by the side of&#xD;
Hal and lifted her hand to his lips.&#xD;
'She's dead too !" he cried, and fell&#xD;
lifeless uponl the sod.&#xD;
Pearl and lRalph raised the in-&#xD;
sensible form of Hal. Chris waved to&#xD;
Scipio who drove up rapidly.&#xD;
IHal  was   tenderly  placed(  on&#xD;
cushions under a tree.  Pearl bathed&#xD;
her tace: gradually the color returned.&#xD;
Hal opened her eyes and smiled on&#xD;
each in turn.&#xD;
You'll s1oon he better, dear sister.&#xD;
said Pearl.&#xD;
"Yes love ! I ani myself again ! I&#xD;
have found all that is of my  o their '&#xD;
They wept with her, but in that&#xD;
moment - the brave heart of IIal re-&#xD;
soi med its granl1(lind roism lI  niiame&#xD;

was nameless, hence all her ventres&#xD;

&#xD;
Pearl too had told her all.&#xD;
The night was spent on the spot;&#xD;
Chris having sent ihr the baggage&#xD;
wagon.&#xD;
On the next day Ralph read the&#xD;
burial service from Pearl's book. Hal&#xD;
saw the remains of her grandfather&#xD;
decently interred by the side of the&#xD;
beloved Alice-her injured mother.&#xD;
She clung to the paling while Chris&#xD;
repaired the little square enclosure.&#xD;
The last nail was driven then the ex-&#xD;
scout drew back. Hal entered the&#xD;
sacred glebe spot and knelt with&#xD;
clasped hands.&#xD;
The hats of Chris, Ralph and&#xD;
Scipio were quickly removed as with&#xD;
beating pulses each of the men turned&#xD;
aside their faces. Pearl leaned her&#xD;
face on her hands, while seeking the&#xD;
cover of a tree to hide her fast falling&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
"Out o the depths."&#xD;
The woman y prayer seemed to conse-&#xD;
crate the wilderness around.&#xD;
"Am I lifted."&#xD;
Her brown eyes were upturned as&#xD;
the jewel drops fell from them.&#xD;
"May this dear spot."&#xD;
Again her lips touched the stone as&#xD;
she plucked a daisy from the grave&#xD;
and hid it in her vest.&#xD;
"Unite me with the portion of my&#xD;
mother."&#xD;
Here was Hal's regeneration. Grace&#xD;
had won. A last look at the two&#xD;
clean, grasslessagraves, then turning to&#xD;
Chris, she said:&#xD;
"My friend, I am ready to go back."&#xD;
Pearl took her arm and the sad&#xD;
party drove away for the Oaks.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
BRANTLY SEES A RIFT.&#xD;
Chris wrote to Brantly, as follows:&#xD;
"It is now six months, dear friend&#xD;
and Colonel, since you and  I sepa-&#xD;
rated at Appomattox. I must not con-&#xD;
plain against little to do, since there is&#xD;

good as with pipes.  *    *   *&#xD;
We have had an episode or two&#xD;
here on the point of honor, wnich&#xD;
should have been referred to you. The&#xD;
decision would have been an extra&#xD;
dose of catnip tea as a quietus to an&#xD;
overgrown poupeton. If not success.&#xD;
ful. the nurse's special, if sly resort a&#xD;

worse, the horse pond bath The hero&#xD;
would have been Howard Graham.&#xD;
By the bye, that Colonel who gave&#xD;
you a fair fence at Brent's road, is a&#xD;
clever fellow, but for XXX distilled.&#xD;
Had you doused his glim, you would&#xD;
have been minus a nephew.&#xD;
He is Pearl's brother, son of E. A.&#xD;
Prentiss. I am watching him as he&#xD;
is likely to get into trouble here. The&#xD;
chap swings a rough right arm.&#xD;
Well what of Hal? Hal, is as gen-&#xD;
tle a little woman as you ever saw.&#xD;
She is Hal Prentiss. Don't start.&#xD;
Daughter of Alice Rofton, the law-&#xD;
ful wife of Pearl's father, thus half-&#xD;
sister of Pearl and Ruger aforemen-&#xD;
tioned. E. A. P. effected this match&#xD;
during a college vacation which you&#xD;
remember. So that it is my special&#xD;
p.ivelege to report her line straight.&#xD;
She is at present with your sister.&#xD;
True as steel, and very devoted to her&#xD;
accepted aunt.  Hal is now  waiting&#xD;
to clasp your honest hands or stout&#xD;
knees or both, and say, forgive a de-&#xD;
luded woman.&#xD;
About Howard; well Colonel, he is&#xD;
a dyed in the wool villain. I do&#xD;

the husband of our deluded Hal. It&#xD;
was he that deserted the poor thing,&#xD;
nor would you have known it had he&#xD;
not admitted when in liquor at the&#xD;
Springs, that, there was a marria ge.&#xD;
He was the student; I knew it when I&#xD;
left you, but preferred getting Hal's&#xD;
record clear. Guess he can't run&#xD;
safely on bigamy, if he does, there'll&#xD;
be a stir.&#xD;
Now about the plantation.  A dam&#xD;
or two to be repaired. new mill, gen-&#xD;
eral turning  over, &amp;amp;c, will bring&#xD;
things straight. As I want you    to&#xD;
return from  the  "land  of a vow,"&#xD;
home again, I'll get at repairs soon&#xD;
and be ready for you as early as possi-&#xD;
ble. As to'pay: If we quarrel over&#xD;
it, then, cut Chris dead for a fraud.&#xD;
You'll hear in mind Colonel, that so'&#xD;
far as your so-called marriage is con&#xD;
cerned at the Sulphur, it's all bosh.&#xD;
Hal was Howard's wife and both&#xD;
knew it. . She played a cruel part&#xD;
long since repented of. You are a&#xD;
unmarried as I am, but I trust yoi&#xD;
will not remain so, as long as I will&#xD;
Get up from your absent places, an(&#xD;

Chris S&#xD;
Brantly  received  this letter i&#xD;
Baltimore, about the first of Novemt&#xD;
ber. He divided his time largely wit&#xD;
veterans of the old Maryland liun&#xD;
among whom was the brilliant an&#xD;
dashing Harry Gilmer-the famoi&#xD;
raider on the border. The Colon&#xD;
read and re-read the document wit&#xD;
mingled pleasure  and  disgust. H&#xD;
saw, from what had  been previous&#xD;
told him, that Hal had been cruel&#xD;
deceived as to her origin, and nece&#xD;
sarily as to her treatment and that&#xD;
her parents.&#xD;
That, added to Howard's base co&#xD;
&#xD;
duct and-baser desertion led her&#xD;
&#xD;
107&#xD;
&#xD;
seek revenge. The fiery temper of&#xD;
the hold woman sought requital, not&#xD;
tor anyI) personal benefit, but to piro-i&#xD;
cure a mutual ruin. That she w as&#xD;

The Colonel t ook   leave of his&#xD;
friends and returned to the home of&#xD;
the Jfudge, where he had spent several&#xD;
(lays in each month since the surren-&#xD;
der, while waiting a reply from Chris&#xD;
and closing up other minor afitiurs.&#xD;
Besides, he was in correspondence&#xD;

THIE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
Armour, except perhaps by myself&#xD;
and one or two others). No; he mar-&#xD;
ried one Hal Armour, as truly that&#xD;
as Hal Armour Prentiss. The Arm-&#xD;
our is a surname of the family and by&#xD;
it commonly used. Besides, admitting&#xD;
Howard's plea, which is only a base&#xD;
pretext, marriages and baptisms are&#xD;
more frequently performed with the&#xD;
use of the given names than the en-&#xD;
tire name. I am not disposed a&#xD;
moment to admit, that Howard is&#xD;
other than a villain, bent upon aban-&#xD;
doning one he has tricked to take&#xD;
another.&#xD;
Now as to your faux pas ! That&#xD;
was unavoidable. It fell to your lot.&#xD;
That is all. She was possessed of re-&#xD;
markable attractiveness, moved in&#xD;
excellent society and so carefully sup-&#xD;
pressed the match with Howard, that&#xD;
it was known only to a few. The&#xD;
kind consideration for Doctor Pren-&#xD;
tiss covered even that from public&#xD;
gossip. Assuredly, when you met her&#xD;
abroad and later at the Springs, it&#xD;
was impossible that you should not&#xD;
have been ignorant. Had I or any&#xD;
gentleman been circumstanced as you&#xD;
the result would have proved the&#xD;
same. As to the validity of the mar-&#xD;
riage with her, that cancels itself.&#xD;
Either she purposely . resolved on&#xD;
bigamy, or to be more charitable, on re-&#xD;
venge for supposed   wrongs.   We&#xD;
know she was bent on the latter, in&#xD;
the admission made to your scout.&#xD;
At anyrate, fraud violates a contract.&#xD;
She offered you a wife; legally she had&#xD;
no wife to give; she was already wed-&#xD;
ded. So far as the moral view goes,&#xD;
you did no wrong ! On the contrary&#xD;
you have been severely wronged.&#xD;
There are times Colonel, when un-&#xD;
avoidable ills beset to stab an honor-&#xD;
able life and cloud a social career,&#xD;
but, who is safe? You were cruelly&#xD;
duped. That is the sum of it. My&#xD;
&#xD;
wife and I knew of this very soon&#xD;
after it occurred.  I could have told&#xD;
you  before Spangler  unearthed it.&#xD;
Why   not?   Because  it was of Ino&#xD;
consequence, and certainly I did not&#xD;
desire to rob an old sore.&#xD;
Just letit all go. Hal regrets it; you&#xD;
have acted   kindly, magnamiously.&#xD;
You said, in good faith, I'll take yon&#xD;
to wife; she had no wife to give. You&#xD;
found this out an hour later, at once&#xD;
left her, and so discarded a fraud. On&#xD;
my honor Colonel, you stand before&#xD;
me as if Leo Brantly had never seen&#xD;
Hal Prentiss."&#xD;
Brantly sat still as the keen eyes of&#xD;
the lawyer looked in his.&#xD;
"So you have always known of'&#xD;
this?"&#xD;
"Yes ! and more. I knew that her&#xD;
father had left a damaging impres-&#xD;
sion on the mind of the hired nurse&#xD;
against your family. Aye sir! He&#xD;
was a base man."&#xD;
Brantly saw a savage look on the&#xD;
Judge's face.&#xD;
"He was the author of her troubles&#xD;
think you?" asked Brantly.&#xD;
"And mine ! I shot him at his own&#xD;
challenge, and shall ever regret, that,&#xD;
I did not bear reproach, rather than&#xD;
send a fellow creature unprepared into&#xD;
eternity.&#xD;
The Judge rose and offered Brantly&#xD;
his hand.&#xD;
"Excepting the mortification-that&#xD;
has been so extreme, you are morally&#xD;
and socially free from any cause for&#xD;
reproach "&#xD;
"Your   opinion,   sir !"  returned&#xD;
Brantly," is valued more because of&#xD;
your being disinterested as also for&#xD;
your candor. I accept it and thereby&#xD;
am much relieved."&#xD;
Brantly continued, "you'll see that&#xD;
Spangler looks after my affairs while&#xD;
I am absent, but he needs funds to&#xD;
put my plantation in working order.&#xD;
&#xD;
I will therefore get an estimate from&#xD;
him  as to the expense and send a&#xD;
check before leaving..I&#xD;
The delay incurred by a mortgage,&#xD;
&amp;amp;c., will inflict me on you again for&#xD;
awhile."&#xD;
''You  have   the  original  ofler&#xD;
Colonel, to share what is mine as you&#xD;
may   prefer. Come and go as you&#xD;
please."&#xD;
Brantly therefore used the hospi-&#xD;
tality of the Judge's household mtre&#xD;
frequently and for a longer time than&#xD;
he expected, owing to the delay in&#xD;
obtaining a loan on his estate and the&#xD;
necessary  preparation  of  papers.&#xD;
Meanwhile   he often   studied  Miss&#xD;
Cleapor's face, to discover ifhe might,&#xD;
her views as to what he was assured,&#xD;
she had learned from her father; but&#xD;
at no time did he see aught to excite&#xD;
an unpleasant thought. Did she, as&#xD;
her father excuse his mistake on the&#xD;
ground of the unavoidable; or was she&#xD;
unconcerned?  He    had enjoyed the&#xD;
charm of her society sufficiently long&#xD;
to realize the constantly prevailing&#xD;
sentiment which intensified with each&#xD;
succeeding clay; she is a splendid wo-&#xD;
man ICalmly he encouraged the&#xD;
fascinating deam, but anon, a black&#xD;
wing darkened nearby; a shade of&#xD;
humilation saddened him; she can hut&#xD;
barely tolerate me !&#xD;
Once, while   at her side in the&#xD;
flower-garden, he startled, the beauti-&#xD;
ful Virginian, as with a ton of irony,&#xD;
he said, "The mythic conception of&#xD;
manhood is the capacity of an Alicides&#xD;
to perform the twelve labors, with no&#xD;
better reward than a wasting, living&#xD;
death ! How is it, that one may pluck&#xD;
up opposition, stout as trees, by the&#xD;
roots, and yet be a weakling because&#xD;
of one misstep?"&#xD;
"Did the ancients concede to their&#xD;
deities perfection?  Was not Hercules&#xD;
the sport of Mycenae's and Argo s&#xD;
&#xD;
109&#xD;
&#xD;
thing? A kick sent to I einos, the&#xD;
armor er of the (Iods; another for&#xD;
fblly was turned to a beast.   These&#xD;
allegories.   otonel, point a truth, to&#xD;
err is human ! Is there, can there he&#xD;
a perfect man?"      The lady spoke&#xD;
energetically.&#xD;
Brant ly returned  to  t he subject.&#xD;
"Why t hen the human verdliet, to err&#xD;
is tI h ('onden11c( I ed per  e  lThe&#xD;
admitiission of human frailty should be&#xD;
flowed by charity."&#xD;
"That too, (Coriolel, if left to huma'a&#xD;
judgement may b strained. Man pre-&#xD;
s1umes over inc11h  where  leniency&#xD;
cheats a proper restraint.  You recall&#xD;
the play of words which had reference&#xD;
to the presu mably inl fallible head of&#xD;
the church, '/,a;ra non polest erare!'&#xD;
He   deserved   the   stricture. No,&#xD;
Colonel, there is no human standard&#xD;
for human government that is fiulIt-&#xD;
less. That of justice hand in hand&#xD;
with mercy, is the only infitllib le a_&#xD;
size.  All legal exactions are can-&#xD;
celled in the (God man alone."&#xD;
"And   yet a   wrong is none less&#xD;
wrong ! I aw is entitled to its de-&#xD;
mands."   Brantly  was foIrcing  th&#xD;
argument only to prolong it.&#xD;
"Colonel, it was not a blind pityv&#xD;
that once said , 'go sil no more ! It&#xD;
was a vicarious right inl Iinn wh&#xD;
stood for mail, not against God."&#xD;
''Ad fitted ! Still, the sill was glar&#xD;

to-day under the guise of philan-&#xD;
thropy ! It breaks the bounds of con-&#xD;
stitutional right and tramples liberty&#xD;
to the dust. It is manifold, like the&#xD;
head of Janus, looks everywhere at&#xD;
once, whither it will. It frames a bill&#xD;
of rights for the African, and one of&#xD;
non rights for the Chinese. It be-&#xD;
heads a Charles I. and rejoices in a&#xD;
Charles II. It   writes  a  Magna&#xD;
Charta; and rings the bells of St.&#xD;
Bartholemew. It calls a Luther to&#xD;
produce the key of Reformation, and&#xD;
invokes a Hugo to re-establish the&#xD;
Pantheon. Does such a weathercock-&#xD;
guide better or worse society? It in-&#xD;
fluences, I grant, as the breeze does&#xD;

-No Colonel! There is no guage&#xD;
save truth. There is no truth save as&#xD;
found in righteousness. There is no&#xD;
righteousness save as found in God's&#xD;
law."&#xD;
She paused, a moment, then added&#xD;
in soft parenthisis, "You'll excuse a&#xD;
little church woman, Colonel, whose&#xD;
Bible and prayer book write against&#xD;
all save the great head of truth, errare&#xD;
Aumanu eat."&#xD;
"You are a stout defender dear&#xD;
lady, so stout, that the danger of de-&#xD;
feat holds me to the issue, not to say,&#xD;
the delights of your conversation."&#xD;
He raised his hat. She smiled. "Still&#xD;
there is so wide a desert, I use the&#xD;
word thoughtfully ! So wide a desert&#xD;
between the Soudan of dry theory and&#xD;
the Barbary of delightful realization,&#xD;
that I renew my point. As the per-&#xD;

You will have to permit the assertion,&#xD;
I regard both it and duty so misunder.&#xD;

as devoid of justice and as heartless as&#xD;

"I renew my point ! A life of values,&#xD;

naught, often because of a trifling slip.&#xD;
What becomes of the harsh, dry, burn-&#xD;

depends such an incongruity?"&#xD;
"The desert, Colonel, lies there to&#xD;

propriety holds. The desert has its&#xD;
blinding siroccos, its glittering aridity,&#xD;
its bones on the way ! All these make&#xD;
the night winds more welcome and the&#xD;
stars more glad.  It is there Colonel,&#xD;
to remind the traveller who tempts&#xD;
it-that, it is a desert! Let him be&#xD;
guided to an oasis-duty, and he is&#xD;
safe. Let him   be reckless and he is&#xD;
lost. Truth and duty are synonymous.&#xD;
Kant says, "Duty !-wondrous thought&#xD;
that workest neither by fond insinua-&#xD;
tion, flattery nor by any threat,. but&#xD;
merely by holding up thy naked law&#xD;
in the soul, and so extorting for thy-&#xD;
self always reverence, if not always&#xD;
obedience, before whom all appetites&#xD;
are dumb,however secretly they rebel!"&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
"We are unable to pierce the past,&#xD;
the future is hidden from us, but the&#xD;
categorical imperative call of duiy to&#xD;
be performed stares us in the face-the&#xD;
obligation of one and all of us to do&#xD;
our share, and to live up to the&#xD;
highest ethical and osthetical stand-&#xD;
ard we can formulate, without regard&#xD;
to reward or punishment and before&#xD;
the worship of every other ideal."&#xD;
"Are there no exceptions to the iron&#xD;
rule, Virginia?"&#xD;
She turned sharply, although he&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
had spoken no less respectful than&#xD;
familiar.&#xD;
"Vhosoever sinneth in the least,&#xD;
bath violated the whole! Still, mis-&#xD;
takes are our lot." She looked steadily&#xD;
at him. He felt strengthened.&#xD;
"Thanks dear lady! Now adjudge&#xD;
my case, you being the second whose&#xD;
opinion I have asked, except that ofa&#xD;
legal friend."&#xD;
He stood in the way of the lady, as&#xD;
if anxious to get a reply.&#xD;
"Colonel, you must first put the case&#xD;
in form. Whether it is one of love&#xD;
at firt sight, an old preference wear-&#xD;
ing away, a resolution to take monas-&#xD;
tic orders or a vow to love all women&#xD;
alike, I cannot say ! You have come&#xD;
into court unprepared so far and the&#xD;
case is to be emended."&#xD;
Worse and worse, he thought ! I'll&#xD;
now leave the matter for awhile where&#xD;
it is. She  will probably learn all&#xD;
from the Judge ,&#xD;
As he sat reading that afternoon,&#xD;
Brantly saw the Judge and his daugh-&#xD;
ter arm  in  arm   promenading the&#xD;
piazza, while the father talked in a&#xD;
slow emphatic manner, Virginia look-&#xD;
ed straight ahead as one who sees the&#xD;
way.&#xD;
Brantly could not from the calm&#xD;
manner of both infer anything. He&#xD;
hoped and yet dreaded the result, if it&#xD;
was concerning his faux pas.&#xD;
Virginia Cleapor had now learned&#xD;
everything from her father. She was&#xD;
surprised and for the first time saw&#xD;
the reason for several ambiguous ex&#xD;
pressions dropped by Brantly. Annoy-&#xD;
ed to know, that a brave generous&#xD;
gentleman had been subjected to so&#xD;
long a period of mental discomiifoIrt,&#xD;
she thought, but that is his adair, I&#xD;
need not think of it again.&#xD;
She was mistaken. Anot her garden&#xD;
stroll called up the inevitable.&#xD;
"I promised my charming friend&#xD;
&#xD;
inot to be an Atlas for burdens not&#xD;
self impi~iosed.  I have succeeded."&#xD;
"I rejoice with you Colonel ! There&#xD;
are too many unavoidable troubles in&#xD;
life, for us to cling to the dispensable&#xD;
one-," she replied.&#xD;
"Anid soi much    happiness if we&#xD;
dared reach to it ! Is it accident or&#xD;
fate that. leads us to the threshold of&#xD;
serenity and shuts the d(oor on our&#xD;
sight?"&#xD;
Ile plucked a leaf on which depend-&#xD;
ed a big rain drop.&#xD;
''Some, dear lady are the glaring&#xD;
diamonds of pretension ! Flashing out&#xD;
and ever beauteous light, from a sel-&#xD;
fish self! Some-, I'd rat her say on&#xD;
is this rain drop under the leaf ! It&#xD;
has no pretension, it will not flash,&#xD;
only as the sunlight of virtue and re-&#xD;
ligion bids it, then it gives out, not,&#xD;
self. but grace from   above. Anm I&#xD;
right?"&#xD;
Unsuspectingly, she rep lie, That&#xD;
one Colonel, is fortunate to wear such&#xD;
a trophy of praise."&#xD;
"Yours is the richly deserved meed&#xD;
sweet friend, and   with it I oiler 'a&#xD;
man's deepest homage." Ilie took her&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Virginia! Leo Brantly has crossed&#xD;
the desert of dreariness, and dares ask&#xD;
to  bask under the soft stars, anid in&#xD;
the sweet repose' of your confidence-&#xD;
I love you , and love because I hav-&#xD;
learne'd what love is.'&#xD;
The handsome pair returned arm in&#xD;

&#xD;
"Him   ride  past yer yesterday!&#xD;
Didn't say nothin, but look in like&#xD;
he'd want ter see somebody."&#xD;
"If you see him again, tell him to&#xD;
meet me anytime at the mill."&#xD;
Scipio returned the polite, "Yaas&#xD;
ear."&#xD;
On the day following Scipio was&#xD;
tugging under a bag of corn towards&#xD;
the mill, when he was familiarly hail-&#xD;
ed, "Scipio !" turning he saw Ruger&#xD;
riding towards him.&#xD;
"All well at home, old man?"&#xD;
"Tenk you sar, all is sorter mid-&#xD;
dling."&#xD;
Scip pulled his hat politely.&#xD;
"Miss Hal has been very ill they&#xD;
tell me, she is better, eh?"&#xD;
"She war berry sick sar, awhile&#xD;
back, but she am pert and all right&#xD;
now sar."&#xD;
"I am very glad Scip to hear such&#xD;
good news! You'll not say to anyone&#xD;
that I am here! except to Captain&#xD;
Chris. I'd like to see him this even-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
"He tell me sar, to tell you, to pint&#xD;
de mill. He'll meet you enny time."&#xD;
"All right Scip, about four o'clock."&#xD;
At four Chris and Ruger were sit-&#xD;
ting on the mill dam chatting pleasant.&#xD;
ly and smoking.&#xD;
"I've been engaged by a circus&#xD;
company that is travelling the South.&#xD;
My gymnasium acquirements came&#xD;
back quite easily, and I am tolerably&#xD;
good at pugilism. Good enough to&#xD;
caricature a Heenan. The pay is&#xD;
enough for a single man and too much&#xD;
for a whiskey drinker. What I want-&#xD;
ed to see you about is, here's a little&#xD;
money for Hal, she must need it, and&#xD;
an ornament for Pearl. When you&#xD;
deliver them I shall be gone."&#xD;
Heputa roloflgreenoack in the&#xD;
hands of therex-scout, and an exquisite&#xD;
set of pearls set in filigree.&#xD;
"She'll wear them from the scape-&#xD;
&#xD;
grace brother, on the night of her&#xD;
wedding. Another matter is, Howard&#xD;
is about to marry Eva Crawfird.&#xD;
That I shall prevent. He might mar-&#xD;
ry the Devil's sister if he chose, had&#xD;
he not played false to Hal, but he&#xD;
cannot run his role unrebuked. Hal&#xD;
despises him   I know, and well she&#xD;
might. She would never speak to hun&#xD;
again ! Still, that does not leave hint&#xD;
free  to do  as he pleases. He can't&#xD;
marry any one if I know it."&#xD;
Ruger closed his burly fist in an&#xD;
emphatic way.&#xD;
Chris admitted the correctness of&#xD;
the position, the brother had taken,&#xD;
yet apprehended trouble as the wed-&#xD;
ding was set for the next week.&#xD;
"You'll take me along," said Chris,&#xD;
"when you go to interfere."&#xD;
"Of   course,   my   good   fellow!&#xD;
Wouldn't feel as if I'd treated Hal's&#xD;
best friend right, unless you were&#xD;
along to keep me from making an ass&#xD;
of myself."&#xD;
"You're clever in placing such con-&#xD;
fidence in me ! I will be ready fbr you&#xD;
at any time you send me word."&#xD;
"We might as well agree about it&#xD;
now Chris! This is Friday. On Wed-&#xD;
nesday night the affair is to come off&#xD;
at the church, at seven. Meet ne&#xD;
here sharp at six. Will that do?"&#xD;
said Rnger.&#xD;
"That will do! Its a pity the dirty&#xD;
scoundrel couldn't get rid of the ex-&#xD;
posure for the sake of his fanmil y and&#xD;
the girl;" remarked Chris.&#xD;
"Not a bit of it! He des, rves any&#xD;
thing. The family are about the same&#xD;
ilk. Awfully tony and cruelly selfish.&#xD;
As to the girl; she took any one, and&#xD;
can't blame another than herself! By&#xD;
the bye! Did you hear that IBrantly&#xD;
had agreed to link on to Miss Cleapor?"&#xD;
"No! That's glorious!" replied ('hris&#xD;

Julian daintily lit a cigarette.&#xD;

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
The church was gaily dressed with&#xD;
wreathings and mottos. Hot house&#xD;
plants were ranged in lovely spiral&#xD;
display along the pulpit steps. A&#xD;
profuse bgguet ornamented the read-&#xD;
tg desk, and a great hell, like love's&#xD;
cornucopia seemed ready to pour its&#xD;
fullest delights on the heads of the&#xD;
candidates to he presented.&#xD;
The crowd assembled until the pews&#xD;
were packed, and the vestibule a jam.&#xD;
A flutter of fans was followed by a&#xD;
great buzz and whispering. The car.&#xD;
riages of the bridal party rolled up to&#xD;
the door. Then the slamming of car-&#xD;
riage doors, driving away of one and&#xD;
halting of another vehicle.&#xD;
Next the arrangement of the party!&#xD;
The brilliant clang of the wedding&#xD;
march by an expert organist, the cran-&#xD;
ing of necks, leveling of glasses, smiles,&#xD;
criticising and finally the presentation&#xD;
of the couple attended by twelve pairs&#xD;
of waiters.&#xD;
Chris might have been seen on the&#xD;
leftof the altar, in whit is known as&#xD;
amen corner. He leaned carelessly&#xD;
against and behind a post that sup-&#xD;
ported the gallery.&#xD;
The ceremony proceeded until the&#xD;
reverend gentleman officiating, said,&#xD;
audibly:&#xD;
"If anyone objects, let him or her&#xD;
now speak, or forever hold the peace."&#xD;
"I object," was heard savagely from&#xD;
the rear of the church.&#xD;
The audience turned to see a power-&#xD;
ful man pushing through the crowd.&#xD;
Altemont twisted his  moustache&#xD;
daintily as he looked at Howard.&#xD;
A bare minute elapsed, the bridal&#xD;
party w~re agitated. Eva was resting&#xD;
as if quite ready to faint on Howard's.&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
He glared savagely as Ruger faced&#xD;
the clergyman.&#xD;
The congregation had risen to their&#xD;
Afeet.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I object, to that match!" repeated&#xD;
Ruger, ignoring Howard's look.&#xD;
"By what right sir. Please state it.&#xD;
But do not allow a captious obje tio&#xD;
to disturb so sacred a scene as this"&#xD;
replied the minister.&#xD;
"That man sir ! Has a living wife.&#xD;
By heavens I'll prove it ! I am Ruger&#xD;
Prentiss, brother of      ! Do yon&#xD;
remember?" He glared at Howard,&#xD;
"Please announce," said  Howard,&#xD;
"that I can clear this all up. You'll&#xD;
dismiss the proceedings "&#xD;
Eva had reached the fainting point,&#xD;
and  uttering  a shriek  fell into a&#xD;
friend's arms. She carefully protected&#xD;
the Tetlow's and Lubin's before the&#xD;
collapse.&#xD;
Altemont bowed to his partner and&#xD;
excused himself with the remark,&#xD;
"I'll call on you to-morrow, must see&#xD;
this little affair out."&#xD;
He then removed his kids and took&#xD;
his stand p.side.&#xD;
A   ew pgre           around, but&#xD;
most of the congregation, fearing&#xD;
trouble, went outside. The minister&#xD;
remained to counsel peace.&#xD;
"I hold a little document Mr Ruger&#xD;
Prentiss, that may be of interest on&#xD;
this occasion, please allow my friend&#xD;
to read it! It is a certificate from&#xD;
James Rod man, N. P., that the true&#xD;
name of the lady I contracted with&#xD;
was Prentiss-not Armour"&#xD;
"So you   saw  fit to desert a lady&#xD;
whom   you  decoyed as a school girl&#xD;
into marriage on this pretext! This&#xD;
is what you would like to convey to&#xD;
the public. Did you marry her for&#xD;
the name or herself. She was both&#xD;
Armour and Prentiss. My father&#xD;
gave her his legitimate name, if not&#xD;
all of it, and she an infant at his&#xD;
death was none the wiser."&#xD;
Ruger faced him s'a near that Chris&#xD;
got ready to interfere.&#xD;
"No sir! You are a villain !"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"Hold   on  please  MrPrentiss,"&#xD;
interrupted Altemoit, "Thiis is not the&#xD;
plcet fir epithets.  If you'll select a&#xD;
friend I'll arrange all the incidentals&#xD;
outside.  A fire stand, and pair of pis-&#xD;
tols are handy "&#xD;
"You   see ahout the incidentals as&#xD;
soon as you please and stand aside, or&#xD;
I'll pitch you   out of that window&#xD;
Stand aside."   Ruger laid his hand&#xD;
on Altenont's breast and moved him&#xD;
easily aside.&#xD;
"You'll answer to rme first or last as&#xD;
you please," said Altemaiit buttoning&#xD;
his coar, ''Howard you'd etter pocket&#xD;
this paper. but stand up to the issue.&#xD;
I respect the church au my friend the&#xD;
minister. If you (it) not transfer your&#xD;
case outside you may excuse me until&#xD;

Altemont retired, at anvrate to) his&#xD;
credit as a gentleman, and remained&#xD;
close at hand.&#xD;
"Do you propose," said Howard,&#xD;
'pressing the issue of your responsi-&#xD;
bility first, or the lady's unwarranted&#xD;
claims on me? Either will suit my&#xD;
convenience.'&#xD;
At this moment Chris Spangler&#xD;
stepped forward bowing to the minis-&#xD;
ter and the few remaining members&#xD;
of the congregation. He said:&#xD;
"So far as the paper is concerned&#xD;
which Mr Graham holds, it is met&#xD;
face to face with this, a stub certificate&#xD;
witnessed by the official who per-&#xD;
formed  the  marriage  ceremony in&#xD;
1860. I vouch for this:"&#xD;
"The herculean frame stood more&#xD;
crect than usual as he looked around.&#xD;
"The effort Mr Graham      makes,&#xD;
may be apro forma case, but he knows&#xD;
the sequel already.  As Mr Altemont&#xD;
has said, this building was not erected&#xD;
for such a scene. and I move that we&#xD;
adjourn"&#xD;
"The good minisler touched Chris&#xD;
&#xD;

"I wvill sir," said Chris, b'hut a lly&#xD;

I Ward was met, at the door by&#xD;

Alitemnt produced a flask.Pas-&#xD;

Chris do- cined the honor.  Ruger&#xD;
took the flask and  n  1ured out a drink&#xD;
in the metal cup that was a part of&#xD;
the Vessel.&#xD;
"Your health si'," addressing Alte-&#xD;
mont, "better society is deserved by&#xD;
so good a man."&#xD;
True to his friendship, Altemont&#xD;
refused to receive the toast that in-&#xD;
sulted his friend.. -le pou red  the&#xD;
liquor out then replied, "a goad man&#xD;
never deserts a friend, nor recognizes&#xD;

He stood  about five paces from&#xD;
Howard.&#xD;
A t the moment the fire flame drifted&#xD;
fiercely to one side. A vehicle swept&#xD;
up. Hal and Pearl sprang out, and&#xD;
Ruger's band was pinioned by the&#xD;
beautiful deserted wit.&#xD;
"Hrother, you'll not be a murderer!"&#xD;
"Ah, Hal, my pet, is that, you?"&#xD;
He   put the   free arm  around&#xD;
her waist and kissed the pleading up-&#xD;
turned face.&#xD;
"I did not start out dear girl to do&#xD;
murder or be murdered, but when the&#xD;
devil puts his agents in a fellow's way,&#xD;
how then?"&#xD;
"Roger, if you took that man's life&#xD;

"Yes dear Ruger, but you must not&#xD;
stain your soul even for him."&#xD;
Pearl was excitedly urging Chris&#xD;
to interfere! She had never met Ruger&#xD;
to know him, although it was her only&#xD;
brother. Her anxious look was now&#xD;
turned to Hal and Roger.&#xD;
Altemont stood near Howard.&#xD;
"Who the deuce is that splendid&#xD;
woman? By George, she's a countess."&#xD;
"That is the short stop in my game,&#xD;
quondam wife, Hal Prentiss, so-called,"&#xD;
replied Howard. ,&#xD;
"Dang it, Howard! You're a big-&#xD;
ger ass than Iaever supposed. Do&#xD;
you  put the two, Eva and that lady&#xD;
on a par-and run the risk besides of a&#xD;
forty-four slug in your avoirdupois.&#xD;
Gad, phew! What fools we mortals&#xD;
be."  Oh Dogberry!"&#xD;
Altemont sauntered away to laugh,&#xD;
&#xD;
seeing that Ruiger&#xD;
in lovely cost'dv&#xD;
Pearl ad van ced&#xD;
&#xD;
and spangler Were&#xD;
to Ruger led by&#xD;
&#xD;
Hal.&#xD;
Hal said. affict.ionately, "And for&#xD;
Pearl's sake! dear Rnaer."&#xD;
"You little gent! My pure little sis.&#xD;
May I kiss those red lips?"&#xD;
He let Chris have the pistol.&#xD;
"Brother,"  she  replied, "I have&#xD;
thought so unkindly, that. ou did iot&#xD;
co'me to see rie,'and here it umoIi&#xD;
seem I am providenttally sent to stay&#xD;
your uplifted hand from  crime. ()h&#xD;
brother; for my sake, my dead ovia ther's&#xD;
sake let this pass by. He is sufhmeintcly&#xD;
paids! He is your first coursin."&#xD;
Ruger turned and looked at How-&#xD;
ard who remained at his position.&#xD;
He pressed Pearl's face betw'eeii his&#xD;
rough palms and kissed her lips as if&#xD;
she were a child.&#xD;
"Yes petty  sis. I did not intend&#xD;
seeing you because I am a rough boy!&#xD;
But you are so pretty, so sweet, that&#xD;
I am a deuced sight hetterthan I&#xD;
thought! Say Chris! tell Altemomnt he&#xD;
can dismiss that scoundrel c'otisi (Of&#xD;
mine. I'll see Altemont some other&#xD;
time."&#xD;
Chris had a short talk with Alte-&#xD;
mont, im which a very little explained&#xD;
very much.&#xD;
-"Gad, Captain! I beg pardon for so&#xD;
misrepresenting myself to you, as to&#xD;
require a paint brush to brighten pros-&#xD;
pects for a gentlemen. Didn't know,&#xD;
dang it that Graham was so off froni&#xD;
the straight ! Hope sir; you under-&#xD;
stand that I am a gentleman if a&#xD;
trifle free with funds   Should Mr&#xD;
Prentiss desire an appointment I'm at&#xD;
his service, on my own account solely,&#xD;
not Howard's. Kindly present my&#xD;
respects to the ladies and say that I&#xD;
am grateful that their rapid drive was&#xD;
not caused by me. At anyrate the bril-&#xD;
&#xD;
1I&#xD;
&#xD;
Look up sweet Pearl,- and IAhi&#xD;
There.   An    old  time buster. A!&#xD;
that's  a brother's privilege' Chris&#xD;
have you a sister?"&#xD;
"No! I wish I had an extra one to&#xD;
spare you old boy.'&#xD;
&#xD;
liancy of their faces is a charming ofl&#xD;
set to the down-in-mouth ..ojet lt&#xD;
He turned to Howard: "I stuck&#xD;
to you Graham until I made an asp of&#xD;
myself! I have no reproaches.  They&#xD;
will come fast enough from elsewhere.&#xD;
But, having learned what I barely&#xD;
feared, you may recall my hint just&#xD;
before we left for the church! I must&#xD;
respectfully  wipe  my  hands of ihis&#xD;
dirty hosiness You and I are here-&#xD;
after, two."&#xD;
Howard uttered an oath as he dis-&#xD;
appeared towards his carriage.&#xD;
""You'll not come home?" pleaded&#xD;
Pearl as Ruver held her clhse to him.&#xD;
"No little duck! You'll see me off&#xD;
and on! And when you do I hope I'll&#xD;
he a   better boy.  Pearl you'd be&#xD;
ashamed of mue."&#xD;
''+'!h Brother! hut you'll de better!&#xD;
Try! I'll pray for you "&#xD;
"That mav work the change. Noth-&#xD;
iug  less sweetheart.  I am   a hard&#xD;
drinker.  Good bye! Chris, take the&#xD;
girls home.   I envy you my boy.&#xD;
Give Pearl away when Ralph wants&#xD;
her.  Put on that trinket, won't you&#xD;
sweet?"&#xD;
She lay against his heaving breast.&#xD;
"And   you my old time playmate,&#xD;
Hal! True as a Damas .us blade. The&#xD;
grain may run here and there like a&#xD;
snarl, but it's steel! eh Hal?"&#xD;
Hal too was leaning on his breast.&#xD;
He gazed admiringly at them both.&#xD;
They in tears.&#xD;
"T wo gems! How rich I am."&#xD;
'But chase that starting tear away.&#xD;

thy.' I kept my troubles from you&#xD;
because they were the whirlwind of&#xD;
my own sowing. Only forgive a fool-&#xD;
ish, blinded, deceived girl and I shall&#xD;
bil n,, elr ever yours."&#xD;
Pearl and Ralph were married very&#xD;
quietly at home. Mrs. St. Clair&#xD;
agreed with the young people, that,&#xD;
the Pad condition of the South to-&#xD;
gether with a wide extended acquaint-&#xD;
auce precluded a large preparation.&#xD;
A few near friends, with Chris to&#xD;
hand the pretty bride to her gallant&#xD;
husband, and   Hal to greet them&#xD;
warmly, was a delightful occasion to&#xD;
the noble mother.&#xD;
April. The family are all in the&#xD;
pinelands near the Carolina estate.&#xD;
The "Oaks" in Georgia was sold to&#xD;
good advantage. Chris is every day&#xD;
directing,,. planning, superintending&#xD;
some new structure or renewing some&#xD;
injured machinery. He is working&#xD;
Brantly's Retreat place, at the same&#xD;
time assisting Ralph at home. A&#xD;
renovation  seems to respond under&#xD;
his sturdy blows.&#xD;
Captain, what do you suppose Leo&#xD;
writes?" said Mrs. St. Clair looking&#xD;
up from  an open letter, just had by&#xD;
the mail.&#xD;
"That be is in the Khedive's army!&#xD;
He's a good soldier! Did I tell you&#xD;
how he rode in at ManassI. Like a&#xD;
free paladin! All alone. Spurring to-&#xD;
wards Stuart's black horse troop he&#xD;
bowed and touched stirrups with me.&#xD;
We ran afoul of the regulars and had&#xD;
a slashing fight. Leo got too far in the&#xD;
lead. I thought, I'll help the stranger.&#xD;
Nol He can help himself. Three&#xD;
blue jackets rode at him. One a&#xD;
lieutenant in front, two privates, one&#xD;
on each side.&#xD;
Ha, how the sparks flew! Three&#xD;
blades playing at one. The one li&#xD;
ing like a sheen of joy under the&#xD;
y                             three.&#xD;
&#xD;
His heard fell over either should1.&#xD;
His big eyes glowed iii the delight ~f&#xD;
fight. Closer they grouped.  HP ro'e&#xD;
ii the stirrups.  A   sure upper cut.&#xD;
Two hostile swoirds are left.  "Nt  i&#xD;
cuts a, fine resilient! and another, with&#xD;
a well trained horse. He gets them&#xD;
separated.   There  goes a terrible&#xD;
sweep, one is leit.  He rides at him,&#xD;
parries his blow, and runs him through!&#xD;
After the  fight I got his nam&#xD;
We've   been one ever since. But I&#xD;
beg pardon Madam,! Get, me on iny&#xD;
old Colonel and y)ou loose the talking&#xD;
valve."&#xD;
Mrs. St. (lair's eyes glow ed with&#xD;
delight as the ex-scout told of her&#xD;
brother's prowess.&#xD;
"He writes, that he is to marry&#xD;
Miss Virginia Cleapor, on the first of&#xD;
May."&#xD;
"Well Madam! She is a sensible&#xD;
w.lman, and he a lucky man. I'll he&#xD;
on hand sure!"&#xD;
"Yes! here are the cards, one mark-&#xD;
ed special, for you."&#xD;
"Good! Good!" said Chris, reading&#xD;
his note and card. "I am to be best&#xD;
man! Ho     there! Mrs.   Pearl St.&#xD;
Clair!"&#xD;
Pearl wascon     the balcony with&#xD;
Ralph. She came in laughing.&#xD;
"My little directress of proprieties&#xD;
read that and get me ready as Leo's&#xD;
best man. If'uanything is outre about&#xD;
me I'll say you are to blame."&#xD;
It was time for Spangler to start&#xD;
out for Northern   Virginia. Scipio&#xD;
was running the crops pretty well&#xD;
under Ralph's advice. It was mutu-&#xD;
ally agreed, that Ralph and Pearl&#xD;
would remain at home to allow Mrs.&#xD;
St. Clair the pleasure of attending her&#xD;
brother's wending.&#xD;
Hal desired the opportunity to re&#xD;
visit her old home. The three de-&#xD;
parted in ample time to reach their&#xD;
destination.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Brantly tall and erect with the&#xD;
beautiful Virginia-a maze of snowy&#xD;
beauty. A tiara of plaited pearls was&#xD;
the only jewel she wore.&#xD;
Chris stood shoulder to shoulder&#xD;
with his friend. His huge moustache&#xD;
concealing a benevolent firm :mouth.&#xD;
His penetrating eyes disclosing his&#xD;
inward pleasure.&#xD;
The word is spoken, and a blue&#xD;
solitaire-(a gem Brantly had re-&#xD;
ceived from his father which he pick&#xD;
ed up on the field of Algeirs) was put&#xD;
on Virginia's hand. The old Judg&#xD;
&#xD;
119&#xD;
&#xD;
The Judge had desired a full at-&#xD;
tendance of relatives and friends. Phe&#xD;
old halls and parlors were filled with&#xD;
au elegant colipaly.&#xD;
The elite of the old di minion rallied&#xD;
to witness a favorite's nuptials. Spring&#xD;
contributed its richest gems out of&#xD;
floral treasuries, to deck the scene.&#xD;
Loving hands twined garlands in&#xD;
every doorway where the bride must&#xD;
pass.  Brilliant fire stands caused the&#xD;
white palings outside  to glitter like&#xD;
silver bars.&#xD;
The Judge did the honors of recep-&#xD;
tion  His genial greeting was as wel-&#xD;
coming as the broad porch on which&#xD;
he stood.&#xD;
Carriages rumbled to the steps, and&#xD;
drove away as group after group ar-&#xD;
rived.  The  results of the war had&#xD;
left all of these ges s comparatively&#xD;
ruined, but wit the prideof family,&#xD;
they rallied th  best possi le ' n this&#xD;
occasion.)&#xD;
Mrs.St. Clair arm    in arm with&#xD;
Mrs. Cleapor renewed     pleasant ac-&#xD;
quaintances, and an impromptu re-&#xD;
union of ex-officers was held on the&#xD;
piazzas by waiting groups.&#xD;
The hour of eight was struck by&#xD;
the tall old clock, when an amateur&#xD;
string  band  performed   a stirring&#xD;
march. The wedding party approach-&#xD;
ed.&#xD;
&#xD;
each.&#xD;
eI owe  all to  you  m y brother friend .&#xD;
V'irginia he's worth adukedomi!"'&#xD;
"Leo! we have been tru friends&#xD;

Mrs. ('leapr fullmved, and gave&#xD;

of our chat in the hay window. I'll&#xD;

tirtune.  I am dhappv to receive so&#xD;
charming a s8' ter.  May Ieaven&#xD;
bless you both "&#xD;
A slight Irenior passed over Brant-&#xD;
ly.  The chat had been in retereine&#xD;
to another.&#xD;
She stood then, the next to sieak.&#xD;
The invitation to ''I)octo r I'rentiss&#xD;
and family" was turma-l. It did not&#xD;
include Hal, but Hal iicludell herself.&#xD;
The time had cine.   l'he betitatl&#xD;
penitent stood hefibre the bridal pair,&#xD;
the embodiment of health and grace.&#xD;
Her toilet was plaim  buht ex pisitely&#xD;
tast+fulI. Chris thought, she b lovely.&#xD;
"'Vi rgi nia, my od1 (classmnate -"'&#xD;
The  bride  was agitated  by t range&#xD;
emotions. What if she renews her&#xD;
folly.&#xD;
''7You lean on the arm of a brave,&#xD;
honorable husband. May your future&#xD;
be what Hal will pray fir!&#xD;
"Leo," she said, grasping Brantly 's&#xD;
hand, "I ask hut one favor.s Lt rild&#xD;

"That's so good of you!" said Vir-&#xD;
ginia.  "I btve  had to rebuke his&#xD;
fatpfil notions before."&#xD;
Hrantly reached to Hal who stood&#xD;
still near hy, and pressed her cold&#xD;
hanrd warmly&#xD;
"Hal go home with sister! We'll&#xD;
al occupy the old place s "i i&#xD;
The forgiven    Hal felt, that, the&#xD;
weight was lifting. Still she had not&#xD;
inhu'sonied herself to Mrs. Sr. Clair.&#xD;
Until that was done, she was even&#xD;
convicted under the look of as pure a&#xD;
woman as ever graced the walks of&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
THE BUI)LINGS AND CHRIS.&#xD;
Time has steadily cut swaths along&#xD;
the  way   we have   come thus farr.&#xD;
Death and separations are its in-&#xD;
variablt work.    To-day  is; to-mor-&#xD;
row, what?&#xD;
Ours has been a set of stout+ hearts-&#xD;
these in whom we feel an interest. At&#xD;
times the future with at least two,&#xD;
(Hal and Brandy), like the rock&#xD;
inii es of Rilcilis, eold, hard, lifeless.&#xD;
But, there was a guiding Hand that&#xD;
shaped the future to life symmetries,&#xD;
beautiful, classic, immortal.&#xD;
The rusty nail of accident or design,&#xD;
yascillated, swerved, agitated the corn-&#xD;
pass, until the Argosy rode almost a&#xD;
wrek on life's seas! Yet, a faithful&#xD;
wrc     nlf'     es     pilot was somehow always there to be&#xD;
the Palinurqs to calmer waters.&#xD;
tHow  many wrecks lie ghastly on&#xD;
the strand for want of brave resistance&#xD;
to the   wrath  of to-day? re  ayne&#xD;
stoutly writes,&#xD;
"Then up to the contest with fate,&#xD;
Unbound by the past, which is dead.&#xD;
What though the heart's roses are ashes and&#xD;

Ruer's eyes were closed by his&#xD;
sisters' hands and   his remains were&#xD;
laid away   with the honored dead of&#xD;
his mother.&#xD;
'"At home," he said with a ghastly&#xD;
smile as he gripped still strong, the&#xD;
hand of the ex scout.&#xD;
They say that the hag at I)eadway&#xD;

Doctor Prentiss continues a paving&#xD;
practice on the Brent road, an will-&#xD;
ed  all of his property to Hal, his&#xD;
favorite.&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Judge Cleapor have&#xD;
returned to their valley home, which&#xD;
was vacated by reason of frequent in-&#xD;
cursions of the enemy! His age and&#xD;
infirmities obliging a passive position&#xD;
during the war of the States.&#xD;
Brantly  and   his  splendid  wife&#xD;
divided  time  between his estate in&#xD;
South Carolina and Judge Cleapor's&#xD;
home in Virginia.&#xD;
Ralph and the lovely Pearl are the&#xD;
joy and comfort of Mrs. St. Clair.&#xD;
Hal is a constant companion of her&#xD;
aunt She seems to look into the&#xD;
benevolent face, as if to say, there is a&#xD;
debt yet unpaid!&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chris superintends Brantly's plant- &#xD;
ing interests, and is a pronounced&#xD;
favorite of the vicinity. Not a hunt,&#xD;
or fish, or club, is complete without&#xD;
Chris Spangler.&#xD;
Ten years after Appomattox! Two&#xD;
urchins, one a stout flaxen haired boy&#xD;
with intense blue eyes and skin as fair&#xD;
as his mother's, rejoices in the name&#xD;
of "Lee St. Clair."&#xD;
The other a well grown, well knit&#xD;
lad of same age, with a cast peculiar&#xD;
to the descendents of the mother of&#xD;
States, answers to the appellation,&#xD;
"Stuart Brantly,"  are mounted o&#xD;
ponies of the marsh tacked breed-&#xD;
hardy, true and swift animals.&#xD;
The two childish faces are turned&#xD;
towards the horse lot. The chafing&#xD;
bits are held by steady, plump fingers.&#xD;
A glad laugh lights up their counten-&#xD;
ances. A noble stallion steps out of'&#xD;
the stable, and strides grandly under&#xD;
an erect rider.&#xD;
"Off with you boys! No racing. Il&#xD;
not have it. Go to the lower landing&#xD;
and at best not out of a canter. I'm&#xD;
right behind you, dye hear?"&#xD;
"Can't I win a bet from Lee, Uncle&#xD;
Chris? He said Dash could outrun&#xD;
Rosa in a quarter. It's a good road&#xD;
and my girth is all right," begged&#xD;
Stuart.&#xD;
"No sirt You do as I say, Lee! I&#xD;
I catch you at bets I'll put a stop to&#xD;
your going with me. Get away you&#xD;
monkeys, and ride like gentlemen,&#xD;
as your fathers before you."&#xD;
The lads rode off.&#xD;
Lee said slyly to Stuart, "If we ge&#xD;
him on the score that Rosa is a littl&#xD;
stiff in front he may let us fret bot&#xD;
to prove that she isn't."&#xD;
"Don't fool him!" replied Stuar&#xD;
"but I'd like to leave you a length.&#xD;
The old soldier rode Count. ' hy&#xD;
horse was at his full keeping. II&#xD;
&#xD;
121&#xD;
&#xD;
had a long   swinging stride that put&#xD;
the ponies at their hest.&#xD;
The sunny curls ultated above one&#xD;
saldle, and the hrowV n trees danced&#xD;
above the other.&#xD;
"HIa, you young    un111in ,hoMdup!&#xD;
We're all going too) tat.&#xD;

'Aunt 1,1 iintt Uncle ('hri a&#xD;

The reply was lost or the clatter-&#xD;

"Chips of the old blocks. They'll&#xD;
ride in the next war! Get away&#xD;
Count or those boys will run the&#xD;
whole three miles."&#xD;
Chris drew on the bit and Count&#xD;
bounded away.&#xD;
It required a half mile of hard run-&#xD;
ning before 'hris got near enough to&#xD;
hail them down. They drew up.&#xD;
Both tackies in a drip, and both the&#xD;
boys full of explanation, how that&#xD;
Dash kept on after Rosa, or Rosa ran&#xD;
because Dash pushed her.&#xD;
"Is she stiff Lee?" asked Uncle&#xD;
Chris.&#xD;
"No sir! I think she's all right,"&#xD;
replied the laughing youngster.&#xD;
"Yes, and you are both all right!&#xD;
You've had your race, but don't let&#xD;
me hear about the bet."&#xD;
Brantly and his wife sat on the&#xD;
porch as the riding party passed.&#xD;
Chris nodded pleasantly. They re-&#xD;
turned  the salute. It was always&#xD;
right with the boys if Chris had them&#xD;
in charge.&#xD;
Ralph and Pearl enjoyed Lee's ac-&#xD;
count of the race, and urged him as&#xD;
ever, to be if possible, as generous and&#xD;
brave as Uncle Chris.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
ONLY AS FRIENDS.&#xD;
War's rude scars are healing. The&#xD;
ex-soldiers have met time and again&#xD;
at the sacred glebe where death holds&#xD;
truce between the blue and gray.&#xD;
The politicians are fighting with an&#xD;
energy of bluster, that if sincere,&#xD;
would have shamed the valor of a&#xD;
Lee, McLellan, Hancock or Hampton.&#xD;
Peace with gentle influence has&#xD;
striven to reconcile a common brother-&#xD;
hood. Prosperity again scatters its&#xD;
blessings.&#xD;
Hal opens her window blinds on a&#xD;
glorious spring morning. The green&#xD;
marsh is undulating soft as a slope of&#xD;
&#xD;
Canaan, as the tide sweeps through&#xD;
rippling and noiseless.&#xD;
The beardy oaks shade the area&#xD;
which is devoted to the boat houses&#xD;
and landing. The cattle are scatter-&#xD;
ing over the rich pasture ground,&#xD;
Colts and lambs frisk and browse to-&#xD;
gether. The negro song floats clear&#xD;
and blithe over the horseshoe cove&#xD;
between the listing ground and home.&#xD;
The air is laden with odors of the&#xD;
oppoppinax, orange, jessamine and&#xD;
honeysuckle.&#xD;
The eye feasts to langour on the&#xD;
brilliant azalias and peerless japonica.'&#xD;
.A   rallying chorus is sent from tree&#xD;
to tree by the mockingbird as he&#xD;
stands guard over his nesting ma',&#xD;
The thrush tries its note to rival the&#xD;
master song he hears.&#xD;
The blue dove coos and fceds close&#xD;
under the window sills.&#xD;
On the river bank, the white c-nie&#xD;
with bayonet beak, stands in the silver&#xD;
stream ready to peck its prey.&#xD;
The waters gleam and plash as the&#xD;
schools of minnows flee the blowing&#xD;
porpoise.&#xD;
It is a spring morning of the low&#xD;
country in South Carolina. Nature&#xD;
empties its treasure trove to every&#xD;
sense.&#xD;
Hal sees,-and a thanks-giving per&#xD;
vades her soul as the Easter time r   '&#xD;
curs to her mind.&#xD;
She reaches to pluck a bunch rose&#xD;
that almost touches her window shut&#xD;
ter. There is a slip of paper fastened&#xD;
to the   rose.  It is removed. The&#xD;
blinds are closed.&#xD;
She opens and reads. One hand is&#xD;
pressed until the finger tips are bloo(1-&#xD;
less, against her beating bosom:&#xD;
"Not ours the flowers of earth,&#xD;
Not ours the stars !&#xD;
Not from the voicing Sea,&#xD;

the tears aside and rose to deposit the&#xD;
treasure in her writing desk. She&#xD;

eps on his sleeve. Brantly sat at the&#xD;
foot of the bed, Pearl and Ralph were&#xD;
at a window. Mrs. St. Clair was&#xD;
mixing a powder, the lads, Lee and&#xD;
Stuart peeped in at the door.&#xD;
"We've both suffered, she said. I&#xD;
loathed you yesterday, to-day, you are&#xD;
my confidant."&#xD;
Another pleasant smile played ou&#xD;
his face. "What a victory?"&#xD;
Another pause ensues. "She finds&#xD;
her mother's ring --."&#xD;
Mrs. St. Clair chokes back a sob as&#xD;
she places crushed ice on his forehead.&#xD;
"Her true name! Her grandfather!&#xD;
Her mother's grave! She is safe."&#xD;
He is quiet again.&#xD;
"Brantly!" he calls, after a pause&#xD;
of several minutes.&#xD;
"Here I am Chris! Do you know&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
The Colonel took the burning band&#xD;
of his friend.&#xD;
"I'd cram the lie down the throat,&#xD;
of him who would asperse you.&#xD;
You'll forgive? -."&#xD;
Brantly squeezed the hot hand.&#xD;
"Good! You were always true as&#xD;
steel."&#xD;
Now succeeded a half hour of rest,&#xD;
when with a spring and sweep of his&#xD;
arm, he feebly called out, "At em&#xD;
boys! Two to one, charge! Ya, ya,&#xD;
ya!"&#xD;
The effort prostrated him to utter&#xD;
weakness as with a gasp he fell back&#xD;
on the pillow. Brantly returned to&#xD;
his seat with a deep sigh. Mrs. Sr.&#xD;
Clair touched the scout's lips with&#xD;
brandy.&#xD;
The eyes opened slowly and for a&#xD;
few seconds brightened.&#xD;
"Stuart's in! Forward,   forward!&#xD;
Custer the fop! White rag! tone bead&#xD;
more! Game's up."&#xD;
Ralph strolled on the piazza. The&#xD;
'last fight recurred(to him.&#xD;
"Don't race boys! Bet., will you?&#xD;
&#xD;
Let me catch     you at it! Lee and&#xD;
Stuart, my lads, be gentlemen as your&#xD;
fathers are."&#xD;
The lads darted away to hide their&#xD;
sobbings.&#xD;
Another pause of quiet, succeeds,&#xD;
Hal gently enters to relieve the watch.&#xD;
ers. His eyes are closed but the lips&#xD;
move.   A peaceful smile rests on his&#xD;
countenance What is it that brings&#xD;
a lull to the fevered brain? He is&#xD;
musing with the unseen. Ask the&#xD;
invisible waiting ones at the death.&#xD;
bed! There are no tinkling footfallsof&#xD;
cherubs on the floor. Only a deep,&#xD;
heavy, fevered breathing. Yet, he is&#xD;
calm. May    not some spirit being&#xD;
then have whispered, "She is near."&#xD;
Now   his great, dark sunken eyes&#xD;
open. He    takes Hal's hand which&#xD;
has gently touched his forehead with&#xD;
ice. "1 knew you'd be here!"&#xD;
He took Mrs St Clair's hand, (she&#xD;
stood next to Hal,) and held together&#xD;
hers and Hal's.&#xD;
"Brantly!" he called, with a faint&#xD;
voice. The Colonel approached. The&#xD;
dying soldier reached for Brantly s&#xD;
hand and placed it above the two al-&#xD;
ready in his grasp.&#xD;
"Friends,  eh!   Forgiven?"   He&#xD;
gazed in Brantly's eyes.&#xD;
"Yes, dear Chris!     Friends all&#xD;
round."&#xD;
"Hal, do you hear that? I told&#xD;
you. we'd win the fight. Friends all&#xD;
round you Hal !"&#xD;
The weakening fingers slowly re-&#xD;
laxed as each hand was gently with-&#xD;
drawn. The usually earnest, alnolt&#xD;
severe contraction   of  the   throw,&#xD;
smoothed and softened to a peaceful&#xD;
repose. At quick intervals a smile&#xD;
lit the expression telling of a plea-inL&#xD;
strain of fitful meditation. The 11nrt&#xD;
was growing apace so gently, that the&#xD;
stars beyond awaiting him, were a-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
most in sight. After a half hour he&#xD;
spoke again.&#xD;
"The lads; train them well ! It&#xD;
takes two years for a lawn, but genera-&#xD;
tions for a gentleman. Hal, you've a&#xD;
clever duty before you! Those boys&#xD;
and misses-."&#xD;
Hal touched   his hand   tenderly&#xD;
while she choked back her sobbings.&#xD;
He recognized the touch.&#xD;
"Hal !" he whispered feebly, "On&#xD;
guard! I knew it. Just a word brave&#xD;
soul, then-."&#xD;
She bowed her head to his lips, as&#xD;
she took his quivering fingers in hers.&#xD;
"Farewell,  brave  Hal! Farewell.&#xD;
We meet, we part! We pass and seem,&#xD;
only, as friends."- "Only, as friends."&#xD;
Hal sank to a chair burying a&#xD;
weeping face at his side. He rested&#xD;
for an other hour,  ut the clammy&#xD;
forehead t Id the near enc. Sdden-&#xD;
ly he roused   with a paroxysm of&#xD;
strength and ordered:&#xD;
"Steady, wait for the word! Ai,&#xD;
fire."&#xD;
&#xD;
Brantly's lips compress. He recalls&#xD;
the past.&#xD;
The dying man's eyes seek anxions-&#xD;
ly around; Hal is near him. She&#xD;
feels an eloquent pressure of the hand;&#xD;
The  last.  "Still  there!  Goodbye&#xD;
