CHAPTER I.&#xD;
KNAVES AND ACES.&#xD;
S OMEWIIAT past the hour of eleven,&#xD;
one bitter cold night in December, in&#xD;
the midst of one of those terrible snow-&#xD;
storms that occasionally visit New York,&#xD;
a hack might have been seen forcing its&#xD;
passage among the drifts that filled Broad-&#xD;
way, the horses floundering desperately&#xD;
under the lash of the brutal driver. It&#xD;
crept slowly up from Delmonico's at Cham-&#xD;
bers Street, and paused at the door of&#xD;
an up-town club. Its occupants, two gen-&#xD;
tiemen, emerged and entered the house,&#xD;
after bidding coaches to wait, - an order&#xD;
which lie received without responding, be-&#xD;
ing engaged in hurriedly throwing the blan-&#xD;
kets over his steaming horses; which done&#xD;
he addressed himself vigorously to the prac-&#xD;
tice of gymnastics with legs and arms, paus-&#xD;
ing only to make futile efforts to resuscitate&#xD;
the consoling spark in his short clay pipe,&#xD;
and exploding in anathemas over his fail-&#xD;
ure.&#xD;
The two gentlemen, whom we may now&#xD;
inspect as they enter the warm precincts of&#xD;
the card-room, would be collectively de-&#xD;
scribed as young men, though it is probable&#xD;
that a wide difference exists between their&#xD;
ages, - how wide, however, it is not easy to&#xD;
determine. The elder has that wonderfully&#xD;
clear olive complexion which tells no tales;&#xD;
and though you feel instinctively that his is&#xD;
a face marvelously preserved rather than&#xD;
young, you are puzzled, nevertheless, when&#xD;
it is a question of years. Either would have&#xD;
been called a handsome man: the elder was&#xD;
strikingly so; while there was a peculiar&#xD;
charm in the face of the younger which&#xD;
never failed to attract, and which it was yet&#xD;
impossible to define. XVe who knew him&#xD;
often vainly endeavored to analyze the secret&#xD;
of Chancy Wales's physiognomy; it seemed&#xD;
to be something in the turn of his head which&#xD;
brought the frank face full before your own;&#xD;
something in the quick glance ~of the big,&#xD;
brown lion's eyes with their baby lashes, in-&#xD;
expressibly winning, but not to be de-&#xD;
scribed; it gave you a little heart-warming,&#xD;
&#xD;
at any rate, and made you wonder if he had&#xD;
a sister who looked like him. Tom Harris&#xD;
was wont to say that Charley won more&#xD;
friends by his good looks than most mem (10&#xD;
by kindly deeds, though it is not to be iii-&#xD;
ferred that he was lacking in these. As fbr&#xD;
his companion, Dick Huntley, every one who&#xD;
toiled five hours daily under the shadow of&#xD;
Trinity, in the days I write of; knew that&#xD;
face with its spotless Italian skin, its blazing&#xD;
black eyes, and the famous long mustache&#xD;
which were the envy of masculine New&#xD;
York.&#xD;
A chorus of welcomes greeted the new-&#xD;
comers, the younger of whom, at least, was&#xD;
a prime favorite at the club. They had&#xD;
been dining at Del's, down town, Hmintley&#xD;
said. "I had just gone around for a quiet&#xD;
steak, you know, when whom should I&#xD;
stumble on but the irrepressible, whose&#xD;
movements are ever characterized by a sub-&#xD;
lime disregard of time and place. I had an&#xD;
excuse for dining at nine o'clock; but why&#xD;
he should have been foraging at that un-&#xD;
sccmly hour is a matter fbr grave specula-&#xD;
tion. Whatever he had been up to, I 'II&#xD;
testify that it gave him a famous appetite;&#xD;
he has consumed more beef in the last two&#xD;
hours than I thought it possible for mortal&#xD;
man to devour. If all the jeunesse dore'e&#xD;
equalled him in gastronomic prowess, we&#xD;
should have a famine in the land; and as&#xD;
for wine, be is Bacehus redivivus!"&#xD;
We laughed at the speaker. None of us&#xD;
loved the man, who never entirely discarded&#xD;
a certain vague sarcasm in his ready flow of&#xD;
words; but, too clever to be ignored, and&#xD;
especially as Charley's friend, he held a&#xD;
certain title to our friendly consideration.&#xD;
"What does he say?" cried the younger,&#xD;
turning to Huntley with a laugh, - the rare&#xD;
merry laugh that was so contagious; "he 's&#xD;
nothing if not criticaL' Just as if he did n't&#xD;
know I never dine at the barracks stormy&#xD;
evenings!"&#xD;
By this term the young man dignified a&#xD;
palatial brown-stone front on the avenue of&#xD;
avenues, as by the equally idiomatic appel-&#xD;
lation of "mill" he designated a certain&#xD;
bank office down town, wherein he figured&#xD;
&#xD;

CHOISY.                                                        KI~AVES AND ACES.                 5&#xD;
&#xD;
in a mild capacity a part of each day. Of&#xD;
real "barracks" and real "mills" it is prob-&#xD;
able he had a very hazy idea indeed.&#xD;
"As for the charges preferred," he con-&#xD;
tinued, assuming the forensic with fine&#xD;
effect, "they are weak inventions of the&#xD;
enemy," (" Hear!") "made to cover his own&#xD;
sin. I have always observed" (" Hear!")&#xD;
"that men in Mr. Huntley's position inva-&#xD;
riably adopt the poor refuge of Father Adam&#xD;
in the matter of the apples."&#xD;
"Charles, my boy," said Iluntley, blow-&#xD;
ing a far-reaching column of smoke from be-&#xD;
neath his mustache, "you are profane!"&#xD;
At the same moment he drew out his watch&#xD;
and consulted it with close attention. This&#xD;
seemed a rather absurd thing to do, with&#xD;
that fine clock from Tiffany's staring him in&#xD;
the face; but the movement had the desired&#xD;
effect: it caught Charley's attention, and&#xD;
the young man suddenly turned, saying,&#xD;
"Ah! there 's Simms, - want to see him,"&#xD;
and moving away as he spoke.&#xD;
It is not every club or other confraternity&#xD;
of genial souls that can boast the possession&#xD;
of so estimable a functionary ns Sinmis, -&#xD;
Mr. William Slinnis, - steward, purveyor,&#xD;
housekeeper, and general domestic manager&#xD;
at th~ Mayflower. In making this asser-&#xD;
tion I feel sure of the hearty support of&#xD;
every member of that eminently high-toned&#xD;
association. It would be a pleasing though&#xD;
voluminous task to enumerate the many&#xD;
excellent and endearing qualities of this&#xD;
our keeper of the keys; but it must suffice&#xD;
for the present to say that his most con-&#xD;
spicuous claim to our general regard lay in&#xD;
his services in the capacity of the metaphor-&#xD;
ical "uncle," a sort of bank of accommoda-&#xD;
tion on legs. He carried at all times an old&#xD;
- ~nd somewhat greasy-looking wallet secured&#xD;
by a long tongue of leather, and which was&#xD;
of such exceptionally large proportions that&#xD;
some of the younger members facetiously&#xD;
termed it a "valise." In this was ever to&#xD;
be found an unfailing supply of the circulat-&#xD;
ing medium, and for this reason, chief among&#xD;
many others, the Lares on the hearthstone&#xD;
were not more respected at the Mayflower&#xD;
than Simms's antique and well-lined book.&#xD;
Most of us could recall the days when its&#xD;
contents comprised an assortment in charm-&#xD;
ing variety of the crisp, gray notes of many&#xD;
kinds, - dear to our hearts, when green-&#xD;
backs and national banks were undreamed-&#xD;
of possibilities; but no one could remem-&#xD;
ber that it had ever been less grenfy or less&#xD;
worn. It was our convenient treasury at&#xD;
all times; and even if one is rich, as I trust&#xD;
my reader is and as we all hope to be some&#xD;
day, emergencies may happen when the ready&#xD;
purse of the humblest friend is a blessing to&#xD;
be grateful for. The same customs prevail&#xD;
in different lands; and as I hear young&#xD;
Sawyer, who is playing whist yonder at&#xD;
&#xD;
rather high figures for points, call on Simms&#xD;
for "fifty more~" so has it been my fortune&#xD;
to hear Monsieur le Baron Depenser, at the&#xD;
Cerele Massena in the beautiful city of&#xD;
Nice, demand of Gabriel, "Donimez-moi done&#xD;
encore cent louis"; and Gabriel is only our&#xD;
friend Simms reduced to the dimensions of&#xD;
le gart~on suisse. It was always comfortable&#xD;
to have Simms about, and he always was&#xD;
about precisely at the critical moment;&#xD;
so obliging too, and of course you felt no&#xD;
compunctions in drawing on him. You gave&#xD;
him little memoranda, to be sure, of the va-&#xD;
rious amounts received from him, antI some-&#xD;
times, after a bad lot of cards, it was really&#xD;
surprising to find what a number of tens&#xD;
and twenties you were in for on his account;&#xD;
but again, luck would run in your favor, and&#xD;
you would clear the score on the spot; and&#xD;
of course you never fiiiled to do the hand-&#xD;
some thing by Simums, who was so grateful&#xD;
and so glad you had won your money back.&#xD;
I never knew him to lose that invariable&#xD;
pleasant smile which implied such a depth&#xD;
of humble respect; not even when l)OO~&#xD;
Weakly, who, after stealing half a million&#xD;
from the Bank of Blank, had also made a&#xD;
serious inroad on Simms's exchequer, and&#xD;
"pai(l all debts" by blowin~ out his brains.&#xD;
He saul "Poor gentleman!" very sadly&#xD;
when he heard of it, and there was as little&#xD;
disturbance of the pleased arrangement of&#xD;
his features then, as this night when Char-&#xD;
ley Wales came up and asked a loan of two&#xD;
hundred dollars.&#xD;
"Certainly, sir, very happy indeed; will&#xD;
you step this way?" And Charley got his&#xD;
money out of the trusty old receptacle which&#xD;
had never been known to fail but once, -&#xD;
the night that Fred C- lost thirteen&#xD;
thousand to the bogus "Pole" at e'carte' in&#xD;
the winter of 185-.&#xD;
The two friends left the club almost un-&#xD;
mediately after Charley had effected his&#xD;
loan, and old Ted Byrnes, sitting near,&#xD;
glanced at me significantly over his paper&#xD;
as the door closed on them. As I looked&#xD;
back inquiringly, he elevated his shaggy&#xD;
brows, and sententiously remarked, "Sup-&#xD;
per-time at Sam Worthington's in half an&#xD;
hour; deuced fine suppers he has too.&#xD;
Young Wales is having his fling all around&#xD;
apparently."&#xD;
I say" Oh!" only, and Byrnes subsides&#xD;
behind his journal. 1 am only ojme of Char-&#xD;
ley's countless friends; I like him immensely,&#xD;
and he is pleased to give me some evidence&#xD;
of a reciprocal feeling; but I am not au-&#xD;
thorized to criticism his goings up and down,&#xD;
and if he chooses to sup at Sam Worthing-&#xD;
ton's or any other midnight table, it is en-&#xD;
tirely his own affair. I am rather sorry, to&#xD;
be sure; if I were sufficiently intimate to&#xD;
warrant the liberty, I might be tempted to&#xD;
sttggest to him that the convives at Worth-&#xD;
&#xD;
ington's sometimes found the feast more ex-&#xD;
pensive than even its rare viands would&#xD;
lead them to expect. As I am not, I hold&#xD;
my peace to Chancy and to shrewd old Ted&#xD;
also, and, bundling into my wraps, plod&#xD;
homeward through the snow, just as the&#xD;
hack, with its half-frozen driver on the box&#xD;
and the two men within, goes plunging&#xD;
through the drifts around the corner.&#xD;
It is but a short way from the Mayflower&#xD;
to the handsome house in a side street where&#xD;
dwells the gentleman alluded to above as&#xD;
the dispenserr of nocturnal cheer. A quarter&#xD;
of an hour brought the hack to his residence,&#xD;
and Charley bounded up the steps, while his&#xD;
coml)anion pause(l to have a word with the&#xD;
coaches. The broad steps, as well as the&#xD;
walk before the mansion, were cleanly&#xD;
swept, - a condition rare enough on such&#xD;
nights as this even in that aristocratic local-&#xD;
ity; but Mr. Worthington was a personage&#xD;
whose domestic arrangements, from the&#xD;
street-sweeping outside to the minutest de-&#xD;
tail within, bordered on perfection. A vig-&#xD;
orous pull of the bell was instantly followed&#xD;
by the opening of a curiously concealed&#xD;
panel in the groutid-glass of the inner door,&#xD;
and through this a face of ebony, in which&#xD;
kindness and dignity struggled for predomi-&#xD;
namice, looked out with polite but scrutiniz-&#xD;
ing eyes. The rapi(lity of this inspection&#xD;
was such that the invective levelled at the&#xD;
dusky guardian by Huntley, who "could n't&#xD;
abide the d-d nonsense of guarded doors,&#xD;
with all the snows of Russia in the air," was&#xD;
uttered in the rosy glow of a widely opened&#xD;
portal, across which and the brilliantly&#xD;
lighted hall beyond the new-comers betook&#xD;
themselves to a cloak-room. Here several&#xD;
other representatives of Afric's trodden race&#xD;
- smooth, sleek, well-dressed blacks (and&#xD;
nothing in nature is so smooth and sleek,&#xD;
being well dressed, as they) - stood, brush&#xD;
in hand, in graceful readiness to divest the&#xD;
gentlemen of their top-coats and render the&#xD;
myriad small services of the toilet. Never&#xD;
hope, reader mine, to receive such attentions&#xD;
with equal skill and tenderness in any other&#xD;
land than this, or from an other hand than&#xD;
Sambo's: your gar~on coiffeur of the Palais&#xD;
Royal or your oily paruechiere of the Tole-&#xD;
do; the clumsy wretch who comes to the&#xD;
call of "Boots" in a London tavern; and&#xD;
the yellow-haired, strong-sn~elling barbarian&#xD;
of the Lindenstrasse; - all these are frauds&#xD;
and deceptions when compared with our&#xD;
~     jovial black genius of the wisp-broom. In&#xD;
the benighkd Old World, Sambo and his&#xD;
graceful wisp are alike unknown.&#xD;
Highly pleased was the foremost digni-&#xD;
tary with Huntley's familiar salutation.&#xD;
"Joe, you shade of Dis! you grow blacker&#xD;
every day. By Jove! we '11 have you&#xD;
skinned for the fleece to hang P the heavens&#xD;
for funerals ! - Easy with that boot!"&#xD;
&#xD;
Joe showed two magnificent rows of teeth&#xD;
and laughed hysterically after the manner&#xD;
of his race, the others joining con arnore,&#xD;
until the room gleamed with ivory and echoed&#xD;
with their deep guffaws. A moment later&#xD;
the dark faces sobered again into utter in-&#xD;
expressiveness; but an almost imperceptible&#xD;
shrug of several sets of shoulders succeeded&#xD;
the departure of the humorous gentleman&#xD;
and his friend.&#xD;
"Know de young un?" whispered one.&#xD;
"I should say 1 do, niggah!" returned&#xD;
he who was called Joe, rather grandly;&#xD;
"dat's Mister Wales, - son of the big un&#xD;
over dyar." And he shot his thumb over&#xD;
his shoulder, to indicate the locality.&#xD;
"Hi-uin!" ejaculated the first, as only a&#xD;
negro may, and a whole orrery of rolling&#xD;
eyes was momentarily visible.&#xD;
"We shall hardly find any one here to-&#xD;
night, I fancy," said Chancy, as they moved&#xD;
down the marble hall. The words were&#xD;
spoken easily enough; but a close watcher&#xD;
might have detected a shade of nervous un-&#xD;
easiness in the speaker's tone and manner.&#xD;
His companion saw it, and laughed lightly,&#xD;
discoursing in a quick, pleasant way as if to&#xD;
dispel the shadow.                    ___________&#xD;
"Ab! shall we not? never think it, old&#xD;
fellow! You will find a frill quorum here&#xD;
to-night, just as surely as you will find all&#xD;
the notable housewives crowding Stewart's&#xD;
and Macy's on rainy days; it 's that Cu-&#xD;
rious antagonism of human nature to re-&#xD;
straint, or some profound sympathy with the&#xD;
elements in our mortal clay, - a bone fbr the&#xD;
philosophers; we must get Hodgson to en-&#xD;
large on it learnedly at the club. Why~&#xD;
the stiffest game of cards I ever saw was&#xD;
played under nailed hatches on the Hero,&#xD;
with a living gale outside, and the women&#xD;
praying for their lives at the other end of&#xD;
the cabin, - twenty thousand on the table,&#xD;
and won by a simple pair. They always&#xD;
dj~ink the hardest down there at the long&#xD;
bar in Broad Street when stocks are sick&#xD;
and everybody losing money. This is n't&#xD;
yery apposite, I suppose; but one is not ex-&#xD;
pected to be apposite after nine-o'clock din-&#xD;
ners at Delmonico's, is he? Here we are!"&#xD;
Above the great, swingingAoors of stud-&#xD;
ded green baize before which they had now&#xD;
arrived, a reflective mind, retaining some&#xD;
consciousness of the situation, might- have&#xD;
seen a graven inscription as terrible in its&#xD;
import as that which met the eyes of (Iream-&#xD;
ing Dante, and in the honest young heart&#xD;
of Charley Wales such an impulse of con-&#xD;
science was yet possible. He was not a&#xD;
saint in his ways of life; but he had neyer&#xD;
entered here, he had not thought indeed&#xD;
tliat he ever should. Was it of this that&#xD;
the elder thought, -man of the world, clever,&#xD;
unerring mask that he was, all-seeing but&#xD;
inscrutable? We may not know; but poor&#xD;

harley, hesitating on the threshold, as if the the dinner down town; but Huntley delib-&#xD;
ounds of revelry alarmed him, felt himself erately investigated the merits of a broiled&#xD;

&#xD;
detectives. Excuse my writing; just the&#xD;
closing prices for Worthington."&#xD;
While speaking, Huntley had scrawled&#xD;
some lines on a card, and now sent it by an&#xD;
attendant to the host. Only "the closing&#xD;
prices," as he had said; but the oldest head&#xD;
in the "street" would have puzzled, I fancy,&#xD;
over, "Erie broke at 62,-old Southern&#xD;
nowhere, - a bird in the bus/i, I think, to-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
Whatever the meaning hidden in the&#xD;
sporting phrase may have been, the recipient&#xD;
apprehended it at a glance. Not once did&#xD;
his eye wander towards Huntley, nor did the&#xD;
amused expression with which he was listen-&#xD;
ing to a profound critique on the last ballet&#xD;
at Niblo's, from the lips of an aldermanic&#xD;
pertonage on his right, vary a shade. But&#xD;
below the table his slender fingers carefully&#xD;
reduced the card to minute fragments and&#xD;
dropped them on the floor.&#xD;
"Does he dabble in stocks too?" asked&#xD;
Charley.&#xD;
"I fancy so, in a quiet way. They say&#xD;
he has an account at Sharp's, and is in with&#xD;
the bull clique on Central. I should not&#xD;
object to his balance, myself; it must be&#xD;
something handsome, aiA money is all of a&#xD;
color in Wall Street. But won't you eat any-&#xD;
thing really? Try the oysters. -Ahi! Rob-&#xD;
bie, my boy, come ra? Easy to see what&#xD;
you come from in your winsome court dress.&#xD;
Nice night for a party!"&#xD;
"Only a 'sociable' at the Nesbits,"&#xD;
responds "Robbie," who has just arrived,&#xD;
resplendent in evening costume, but rueful&#xD;
of countenance;' "awful slow, - square&#xD;
dances, church music, and a cold feed; but&#xD;
one must do the proper thing, you know, in&#xD;
that quarter."&#xD;
"To be sure!" said Huntley, with a comic&#xD;
grimace; "the bee goes where the honey&#xD;
grows. What a pity they should be so rich,&#xD;
those girls, and yet so - what shall we say,&#xD;
Bobbie?"&#xD;
"0, let 'em down easy, say 'plain,"'&#xD;
answered the elegant youth, plunging into a&#xD;
dish of steaming oysters before him. "Ah I&#xD;
this suits me! Imagine cold fowl and sal.&#xD;
ads in this temperature, washed down with&#xD;
thimblefuls of thin sherry ! - Here, you&#xD;
nightshade I give me some champagne. -&#xD;
The fellow stands and grins like a satyr&#xD;
while one is congealing by inches! Lively&#xD;
lot here to-night, eb, Huntley ? - and your&#xD;
friend? Wales, is n't it?"&#xD;
"Yes," returned the latter, rather coolly;&#xD;
"thought you knew him."&#xD;
The table was now almost deserted, and&#xD;
our two friends arose and left Young Amer-&#xD;
ica, cst. nineteen, to his meditations and his&#xD;
champagne.&#xD;
"Queer fish, that Huntley. Don't know&#xD;
whether I quite like him, and I wonder&#xD;
Wales fancies him so much. It 's all right,&#xD;
&#xD;
I suppose. Deuced good these oysters are!&#xD;
Wonder if he had been playing? Looked&#xD;
* flustered. Handsome boy. Odd I never&#xD;
met him." And Robbie dropped the subject&#xD;
in order to devote hiihself more exclusively&#xD;
* to his hot " saddle rocks."&#xD;
Crossing the supper-room, Iluntley and&#xD;
his companion entered through noiseless,&#xD;
swinging doors the salon beyond. It was a&#xD;
large double parlor extending through to&#xD;
the closely curtained windows on the street,&#xD;
* with its spacious area apparently magnified&#xD;
by aa ingenious arrangement of large French&#xD;
mirrors; but even the superb finish of the&#xD;
eating-room scarcely prepared one for the&#xD;
matchless luxury of this magnificent apart-&#xD;
ment. There was a lavish richness in the&#xD;
appointments which fairly cloyed the sense&#xD;
of vision, and which, it is possible, would have&#xD;
its effect in stimulating certain emotions&#xD;
in the beholder and promoting just that&#xD;
excited and sensuous state of mind which is&#xD;
most favorable to "the house." Never was&#xD;
sin so dressed before; never so flattering to&#xD;
the sense, so terribly tempting to the eye.&#xD;
F~inrni ture of enigmatical cost was scattered&#xD;
abbut in graceful confusion; statuettes in&#xD;
Parian and bronze, b~jouterie loading&#xD;
handsome bracket-rests, and inviting smaller&#xD;
paintings of the Jerome school. Over each&#xD;
of the two heavy mantels of wrought marble&#xD;
hung a glowing chef-d'auvre of the copy-&#xD;
ist's art in life-size glory; the one a reproduc-&#xD;
tion of the Naples Danail (in which Titian's&#xD;
warm flesh is almost as golden as his gold),&#xD;
the other the self-same Rubens type of&#xD;
profligate mother Venus intent with Bac-&#xD;
chus and their votaries on drinking each&#xD;
other under the mutual table, - the familiar&#xD;
picture of the Uffizi which one grows thirsty&#xD;
with looking at. The verh~st anchorite,&#xD;
escaping the charm of these seductive pic-&#xD;
tures, would inevitably have been ship-&#xD;
wrecked midway between them, where a&#xD;
glittering cabinet presented a full array of&#xD;
never-failing decanters, flanked by open&#xD;
boxes of fragrant cigars.&#xD;
The whole gorgeous ensemble, from the&#xD;
velvet medallion beneath the feet (upon&#xD;
which the incongruous excrescences of spit-&#xD;
toons would have startled a!oreign eye) to&#xD;
the superficial cornices of cm~imson and gold&#xD;
which surmounted the tinted walls, was a&#xD;
marvel of sumptuousness, to which the great&#xD;
chandeliers of gilt bronze, hung with crim-&#xD;
son swinging globes, gave an almost magic&#xD;
charm.&#xD;
Sales de Jeu are common enough in the&#xD;
older world; big, blazing halls, with trick-&#xD;
ling fountains, exotic flowers, masses of fresco,&#xD;
and dancing arabesques: but it remained for&#xD;
the genius of our own land to produce the&#xD;
fabulous splendor of a New York "gambling-&#xD;
house."&#xD;

III          end of the parlors, and was surrounded by&#xD;
chairs; mimic inlaid cards of ivory gleaned 4&#xD;
from the green cloth which covered it; and&#xD;
the various apparatus of the game, including&#xD;
tall piles of divers-cQlored chips, were there-&#xD;
on arranged under the skilful superintend-&#xD;
ence of the several functionaries. Hazard&#xD;
has taken many forms and rejoiced in many&#xD;
names since they gambled on their finger-&#xD;
ends in the streets of old Rome.&#xD;
This was called "faro," in French phara-&#xD;
on, - a plague of Egypt that has fallen on&#xD;
our time.&#xD;
Most of those who had left the supper-&#xD;
table lingered briefly over their cigars&#xD;
about the reading-table and dropped away&#xD;
one by one; but several surrounded the&#xD;
gaming-table and shared or watched its for-&#xD;
tunes. Our two friends smoked apart with&#xD;
Worthington, who had joined them, and&#xD;
who conversed in the well-schooled, easy&#xD;
manner of his order. As I have said, he&#xD;
was a handsome man, with a clear, smooth-&#xD;
shaven face, finely cut features, and keen,&#xD;
deep-set cyes4 but not even the studied&#xD;
smile or the graceful suavity of his address&#xD;
could entirely hide a sinister something&#xD;
which pervaded him, and was soonest de-&#xD;
tected in the lines about his mouth. His&#xD;
dress was unexceptionable, and itsonly orna-&#xD;
ment a brilliant of great size which sparkled&#xD;
in his shirt-front. lie was undeniably at-&#xD;
tractive,- a well-graced actor on his stran-&#xD;
gest of stages. And just as he had dressed&#xD;
his rooms with cunning art, so nature had&#xD;
flung an attractive glamour about his person:&#xD;
the eye found no outward sign of what the&#xD;
heart might feel, - the nameless evil that lay&#xD;
beyond.&#xD;
"Very kind of you, Mr. Wales, very kind&#xD;
of you indeed, to honor us with a call," he&#xD;
had said, coming up to them and extending&#xD;
his hand for a greeting, which Charley&#xD;
acknowledged rather awkwardly. "Such a&#xD;
wretched night as it is too; as much as a&#xD;
man's life is worth to be out in it, I should&#xD;
think. I have wished a dozen times this even-&#xD;
ing that my house could offer accommoda-&#xD;
sions sufficiently extensive and pleasant to&#xD;
tempt all these good people to stay the night&#xD;
out. As it is, 1 fear it would come to camp-&#xD;
ing out on chairs and sofas with 'short com-&#xD;
mons' in bedclothes. Ali! I see they are&#xD;
going out into it again.- Good night, Judge.&#xD;
Good night, gentlemen. I wish you a safe&#xD;
passage; if you can't do better you can come&#xD;
back, you know. - Nothing stirring in the&#xD;
street, I suppose, Mr. Wales?"&#xD;
"I know of nothing. Huntley is the man&#xD;
for 'points."'&#xD;
"Ahi yes, to be sure; and the man to&#xD;
improve them as well, if we may be allowed&#xD;
the surmise; eb, Mr. Huntley? Will you&#xD;
excuse me? I see the Judge is in trouble&#xD;
with those stupid servants." And he passed&#xD;
&#xD;
swiftly into the hall, from whence came the&#xD;
~cho of the deep-voiced dignitary of the&#xD;
- Court in tones of wrath.&#xD;
"Let 's look at the game," said iluntley.&#xD;
:~ ~ see Sanders of the Whirlwind Club is&#xD;
playing, and it will be worth watching."&#xD;
They approached the table and took places&#xD;
in the ellipse surrounding it, which comprised&#xD;
a score of men, seated and standing, half of&#xD;
whom were engaged in play. The man at the&#xD;
cards, a mechanical creature with a face of&#xD;
marble, through whose fingers the paper&#xD;
squares seemed to glide by a momentum&#xD;
purely their own, favored the arriving couple&#xD;
with a scarcely perceptible glance; and the&#xD;
twQ assistants beside him, impassive ma-&#xD;
chines like himself, dealing out and collect-&#xD;
ing the losses and gains and keeping the&#xD;
busy score, did the same from sheer force&#xD;
of example. Aside from the habitual so-&#xD;
lemnity of these men, which was, how-&#xD;
ever, frequently relaxed in smiles at some&#xD;
winning player's joke, the scene savored&#xD;
little at this moment of the gaming-table&#xD;
as we see it in its glory in other lands.&#xD;
The lively rattle of conversation and occa-&#xD;
sional well-put jest, the innovation of liquors&#xD;
and cigars at the table, and, above all, the&#xD;
absence of that long-drawn moment of sus-&#xD;
pense which is inseparable from the Euro-&#xD;
pean roulette or the deal at trente et quarante,&#xD;
divested the picture of much of the repulsive&#xD;
effect which horribly strained attention and&#xD;
death-like silence give it abroad, and made&#xD;
it even more dangerous.&#xD;
The play was at the full. "Two aces&#xD;
out!" "Queen-deuce!" "Copper thejack!"&#xD;
"Chips for that!" "Make your bets, gentle-&#xD;
men!" "How will you have them?" fell in&#xD;
a chorus on Charley's ear, mingled with the&#xD;
clicking of the ivoryjetons. Among the seat-&#xD;
ed players was a young man whose burning&#xD;
cheeks gave token of the perilous excitement&#xD;
within. He had been winning largely, and&#xD;
at the moment he caught Cbar~ey's attention&#xD;
was in the act of exchanging a mass of chips&#xD;
for the corresponding amount in notes.&#xD;
"That 's Sanders," whispered Huntley;&#xD;
"they tell me he won fifteen thousand here&#xD;
last night, and is doing nearly as well to-&#xD;
night. 'Pon my word, I feel rather in the&#xD;
vein myself. I believe I will try them a&#xD;
turn or two. Chips for this, please," he&#xD;
added, tossing a roll of bills to the banker;&#xD;
"fives and tens; and, waiter, some Bour-&#xD;
bon and cigars. You '11 have some, Char-&#xD;
ley?"&#xD;
The attendant served the desired articles&#xD;
with miraculous dispatch, and Charley drank&#xD;
off the liquor without noticing the quantity.&#xD;
There were two vacant seats near them, and&#xD;
Huntley took one of them, making place for&#xD;
Charley, who, intent on the game, sat down&#xD;
mechanically beside him. Huntley staked&#xD;
ace full for a considerable amount, and won;&#xD;

moved to the deuce, and won again; and was&#xD;
a third time successful in the same corner,&#xD;
having thus quadrupled his original fuse.&#xD;
He shrugged his shoulders slightly, and said&#xD;
to Charley, who had watched his play,&#xD;
"Ought to have doubled. Are you com-&#xD;
ing in?"&#xD;
Young Wales had sat there with the&#xD;
fever rising in his veins. To stand by that&#xD;
table was dangerous; to sit by it was to&#xD;
fall. He nodded, threw some notes across to&#xD;
the nimble-fingered "banker," and in five&#xD;
minutes more he had become oblivious to&#xD;
all the world and the things thereof beyond&#xD;
the ebb and flow of the noisy jetons and the&#xD;
white-faced, emotionless man who manipu-&#xD;
lated the swift cards.&#xD;
0 that strange intoxication of play!&#xD;
that something which thought cannot pene-&#xD;
trate or words describe, - terrible, inexpli-&#xD;
cable, inhuman! Who shall analyze it,&#xD;
who rob it of its delirious attraction, who&#xD;
resist it? God save us! most of us have&#xD;
felt it at one time or another; out to feel it&#xD;
always! It would kill most of us, I think;&#xD;
but there are men who live on in its atmos-&#xD;
phere a sort of vampire-life, who have won&#xD;
the secret of the old alchemists, draining&#xD;
the poison-cup and laughing at death. This&#xD;
one whom we meet in our walks of life and&#xD;
speak of in undertones as a "gambler" be-&#xD;
longs no longer to our common world; lie&#xD;
cam~ exist no longer on the every-day food of&#xD;
humanity, and there has ceased to be a&#xD;
charm for him in those things which consti-&#xD;
tute the happiness of men. He has found&#xD;
another world within this world, and changed&#xD;
his being to fit therein; by the loss of every-&#xD;
thing he has gained a something, and almost&#xD;
defeated nature by achieving the unnatural.&#xD;
He is a man apart, - a living horror, from&#xD;
whom there are none of us so strong that we&#xD;
do not shrink with aThudder, knowing what&#xD;
a little will make us like him, and what a&#xD;
secret life is his. There is no escape, for&#xD;
there can be no cessation; no rest, for&#xD;
chance, abetted as it may be, as it almost&#xD;
always is, by fraud, is ever uneven; no&#xD;
profit, for all values are wiped away for him&#xD;
who lives from cast to cast; nothing but the&#xD;
wild swift course down to the bitter end,&#xD;
broken by intervals of desperate reverses&#xD;
or frenzied transports of success, and ceasing I&#xD;
invariably with mysterious but significant&#xD;
abruptness.&#xD;
Poor Charley Wales was a gambler no&#xD;
more than you and I, who have looked down I&#xD;
at the savage rage over some broad, pro-&#xD;
tecting shoulder, felt its cruel influence, and&#xD;
come away sobered hmmt unscathed. Led by&#xD;
a cunning hand within the magic circle, he&#xD;
felt, perhaps, something of his danger, but ~&#xD;
did not dream of falling. Who ever did? t&#xD;
Who, at his age, walks not gayly along the (&#xD;
dizzy precipices of to-day, weaving some ii&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
bright dream for the morrow? 0 ce with-&#xD;
in, he went on blindly and floundered miser-&#xD;
ably at last. Let us be charitable to the&#xD;
man whom, instead of ourselves, partial fate&#xD;
plunged into the abyss.&#xD;
He played at first with marked success,&#xD;
and, staking heavily, to " follow his luck," as&#xD;
Huntley suggested, gained largely, and pur-&#xD;
sued the mad career with intense excite-&#xD;
ment. Drink after drink of burning spirits&#xD;
passed his lips, and countless cigars were&#xD;
consumed with reckless rapidity; he never&#xD;
noted the frequency of either, or that they&#xD;
were served to him assiduously without his&#xD;
command, any more than he noted Hunt-&#xD;
ley's infrequent play and the gradual de-&#xD;
parture of the other gamesters. He was&#xD;
aware only that the statue-like dealer had&#xD;
disappeared, and that Worthington himself,&#xD;
smiling and affable, had taken his place,&#xD;
drawing the cards with an equally dexter-&#xD;
ous hand. "Robbie" had come in a long time&#xD;
before and put down a note, "to pay," as&#xD;
he would have said, "for his supper"; only&#xD;
in this instance it won another, whereupon&#xD;
he incontinently pocketed both and went&#xD;
his way, not without a shrewd glance at&#xD;
Chancy's excited face.&#xD;
"Quite a new thing for him, I should say,"&#xD;
was the reflection of the period's child.&#xD;
"Humph! hope he '11 get off cheap, that is&#xD;
all&#xD;
The fortune of the table changed at last.&#xD;
The circle of~ other players had dwindled&#xD;
down to some three or four betting at ran-&#xD;
dom and paid with a carelessness that must&#xD;
have excited the suspicions of a sharp ob-&#xD;
server as to their real character; and the&#xD;
busy hum of the hour before was succeeded&#xD;
by almost unbroken silence. It seemed the&#xD;
proper moment, and Charley's store of&#xD;
"chips" and notes began to melt away as&#xD;
it had accumulated; even more rapidly,&#xD;
indeed, for never does the player brave the&#xD;
hazard so recklessly as when the losing turn&#xD;
arrives. The effect on the young man&#xD;
showed how completely he was under the&#xD;
tearful spell; the desperate stakes, the an-&#xD;
~ry exclamations, the trembling hand and&#xD;
~onvulsed face; - even Huntley, who&#xD;
watched him with a Strangm expression of&#xD;
patience on his face, shivered once or&#xD;
twice at the spectacle. When the very last&#xD;
)f Charley's "chips" went back to the&#xD;
ank, however, he said with well-assumed&#xD;
mrelessness, "You are not in luck, Char-&#xD;
ey; better break off." But even as he&#xD;
poke he showed a handful of his carefully&#xD;
servedd chips on a card.&#xD;
"D-d if I do," cried young Wales, upon&#xD;
vhom the reckless drinking of the pre-&#xD;
rious hour was beginning to tell violently in&#xD;
his momentary respite from the excitement&#xD;
)f actual play. "Loan me some chips," he&#xD;
Aded, stretching out his~hand imperiously&#xD;

&#xD;
as he spoke. Huntley smiled, and pushed&#xD;
th e whole pile towards him.&#xD;
"There's the lot, if you want them; three&#xD;
hundred, I think. Plenty to play on if you&#xD;
strike the vein, - eb, Worthington?"&#xD;
The gambler smiled back, and knocked&#xD;
the ashes daintily from his cigar in the in-&#xD;
terval of the deal.&#xD;
"I have seen a bank broken on a start of&#xD;
just one sixtieth of that amount, say five&#xD;
dollars," he replied; and added to Chancy,&#xD;
"My best wishes for your better success,&#xD;
Mr~ Wales."&#xD;
The words attended the draining of fresh-&#xD;
ly filled glasses, after which the game went&#xD;
on. It was all one way now; in three brief&#xD;
casts of the cards the borrowed stakes had&#xD;
followed those gone before. Charley sat in&#xD;
his place a moment, staring moodily at the&#xD;
table, whereupon the three or four other&#xD;
players seemed suddenly inspired with fresh&#xD;
interest and played with great success. It&#xD;
was only a moment, but evidently an anx-&#xD;
ious one for his companion, who watched&#xD;
him with hawk's eyes. Charley broke the&#xD;
pause in a hoarse, changed voice: "Give&#xD;
me some brandy, waiter, your whiskey is&#xD;
rubbish; and a cigar. - Got any money,&#xD;
Huntley?"&#xD;
Worthington smiled affably at the insult&#xD;
to his whiskey, which was really very fine.&#xD;
And Huntley ~re~v out his porte-monnale.&#xD;
"I 'as not riCh to-night, Chancy, but I can&#xD;
give you something, I guess. Let 's see -&#xD;
two hundred - thirty - fifty - five, two&#xD;
fifty-five-that's my pile - tout ce qu'il y a&#xD;
lIt declans! If you will play, it is yours."&#xD;
Chancy seized the notes and played them,&#xD;
without awaiting the exchange for chips.&#xD;
Luck came back to him one little moment,&#xD;
just long enough to fan the dull blaze into&#xD;
a raging flame again; then, in a few adverse&#xD;
turns, left him penniless as before. Again&#xD;
he sat an instant in gloomy silence. It was&#xD;
an awful moment, and one which burned&#xD;
itself upon his memory, despite the numbness&#xD;
of his senses, haunting him for months&#xD;
afterwards, a phantom of regret and shame.&#xD;
Huntley was making an entry in his mem-&#xD;
orandum-book; but he did not fail to catch&#xD;
the young man's glance as it wandered&#xD;
towards him.&#xD;
"Just a record, you know," he said, laugh-&#xD;
ing, "I shall not worry about it. Five fifty-&#xD;
five, was n't it? Quite enough with what&#xD;
you have lost. You are not in luck to-night,&#xD;
Charley. Better go, had we not?" He rose&#xD;
as lie spoke; but a sober observer would&#xD;
have seen the devilish anxiety in his face,&#xD;
and how far from his heart was the desire&#xD;
to go.&#xD;
"Wait!" said Chancy, hoarsely, rising&#xD;
also as he spoke. He was obliged to stand&#xD;
in his place a moment, and clutch the back&#xD;
of his chair, while the room with its gilded&#xD;
&#xD;
walls and dancing lights swam in a wild&#xD;
whirl before his eyes. Then with a thick-&#xD;
spoken oath he staggered across to the&#xD;
liquor-stand, and, pouring a glass from the&#xD;
first decanter he encountered, drained it at&#xD;
one gulp. The draught nerved him for the&#xD;
further effort of reaching the secretary in&#xD;
the upper salon, - an elegant affair of rose-&#xD;
wood and green morocco, hung with little&#xD;
packages of blank checks and drafts on all&#xD;
the city banks, and offering every conven-&#xD;
ience for their filling up. It was with none&#xD;
of these that he had to do, however. With&#xD;
some difficulty he selected a paper from the&#xD;
contents of his pocket, and managed with&#xD;
desperate momentary firmness to write a&#xD;
rapid endorsement across it.&#xD;
His dearly purchased strength barely&#xD;
enabled him to regain the table, where the&#xD;
mechanical motion of cards and jetons went&#xD;
silently on. More than one pnir of eyes&#xD;
had watched his movements with intense&#xD;
interest, though, had he been competent to&#xD;
detect it, he would have found no change or&#xD;
emotion in any face when he returned.&#xD;
He sank heavily in his seat, nnd threw&#xD;
the crumpled paper on the board with a&#xD;
demand in thick, almost unintelligible tones,&#xD;
"Money for that!"&#xD;
An evil chance seemed to have guided&#xD;
Charley Wales's footsteps all this day. It&#xD;
moved him to stop at the Metropolitan on&#xD;
his way up town, to see an old acquaintance&#xD;
who was over from "the Jerseys." In the&#xD;
office he encountered Mr. Perkins, -&#xD;
President Perkins of the Penkinsville Bank&#xD;
(National), who was at that moment in&#xD;
something of a quandary, and who greeted&#xD;
him with effusion.&#xD;
"Ah, Mr. Wales! how fortunate! You&#xD;
come in the nick of time to my relief. May&#xD;
I ask your attention a moment?"&#xD;
Inasmuch as Mr. Perkins, or, more prop-&#xD;
erly, the institution which he represented,&#xD;
kept a valuable account at the great bank-&#xD;
ing house of ~Vales, Burton, &amp;amp; Co. in New&#xD;
York (for Perkinsville, be it said, whereof&#xD;
the Penkinsville National is the principal&#xD;
financial agents settled and mostly popu-&#xD;
lated by the family Perkins, is a manufac-&#xD;
turing town of considerable pretensions in&#xD;

the young man acknowledged the warm&#xD;
greeting of the country banker with great&#xD;
respect, and was properly glad to be of ser-&#xD;
vice. lie excused himself to his friend and&#xD;
stepped aside with the President, who drew&#xD;
a portentous wallet from some obscure&#xD;
recess of his waistcoat.&#xD;
"I intended to call at your office to-day,&#xD;
but I had so much to do, and was so delayed&#xD;

"You are not well, I fear, Charley; yes-&#xD;

careful. Were you kept down town by the&#xD;

"Yes; it was awful, was n't it?" (He&#xD;
was thinking how awful it was, and wonder-&#xD;

did not find a paper - that is, anything in&#xD;

"No, sir," replied the servant. "Your&#xD;
hat, sir?"&#xD;
He moved to the door, and Charley&#xD;
turned to follow, but something touched his&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
"Good by, for all day."&#xD;
She stood with her hand extended and a&#xD;
smile on her face, - a delicate, beautiful face&#xD;
it was, - but in her sober eyes was all the in-&#xD;
stinctive intelligence of her woman's heart,&#xD;
which had fathomed his disturbed manner,&#xD;
and sought to know its hidden cause.&#xD;
A world of anxiety and undisguised affec-&#xD;
tion was in the gaze; he saw it and hesi-&#xD;
tated, took her hand, and hesitated still;&#xD;
then, wrenching it almost convulsively,&#xD;
turned away to the door with a tear-choked&#xD;
"Ta, ta." She crossed to the window and&#xD;
sighed, saw him go by, walking with his&#xD;
quick, elastic step, and then returned to&#xD;
gaze silently at the fire, where she still re-&#xD;
mained when the wondering servant came&#xD;
to remove the untouched luncheon.&#xD;
It was "late - ddivery" time in Wall&#xD;
Street when Charley descended from the&#xD;
omnibus at his father's office, and went up&#xD;
the broad steps with a tremulous heart, -&#xD;
"late delivery," for the ragged bits of stained&#xD;
and unprepossessing paper clutched in the&#xD;
handa .f hatless and breathless clerks dash-&#xD;

lug madly along the swollen curbs, and&#xD;
plunging into the river of mud and snow&#xD;
which filled the street, - "late delivery "for&#xD;
the millions of men's possessions which they&#xD;
hurried thus from aide to side, -"late de-&#xD;
livery," too, for poor Charley, going in to&#xD;
meet his fate at that fan~iliar threshold.&#xD;
A strange visitor had preceded him at&#xD;
the house of Wales, Burton, &amp;amp; Co., on that&#xD;
morning of sunshine and sodden streets, by&#xD;
an inch of time; and it is in inches that&#xD;
time brings on its revenges. Mr. Wales, in&#xD;
his private office, was running rapidly over&#xD;
his large morning mail at his usual hour,&#xD;
when a clerk announced that a gentleman&#xD;
wished to see him. The interruption was&#xD;
unusual, and Mr. Wales did not like un-&#xD;
usual things in business.&#xD;
"Name?" was all he vouchsafed in re-&#xD;
sponse to the message, without pausing in&#xD;
hls work.&#xD;
"Here is his card, sir; 'Mr. Knarles.'"&#xD;
It was not a promising cognomen, and&#xD;
the banker frowned at it. But 'he said,&#xD;
sharply, " Show him in."&#xD;
Mr. Knarles's appearance was not pre-&#xD;
possessing, - a lean, sly-faced, sharp-e~Ved&#xD;
little man, in a rather seedy black suit, -&#xD;
and the banker frowned again as he glanced&#xD;
up at his visitor. He recognized him, how-&#xD;
ever, - he never forgot a face, - as one of&#xD;
those parasites of crime who live on the&#xD;
courts. In fulfilling the one unavoidable&#xD;
duty of citizenship in the jury-box, lie had&#xD;
once beheld in Mr. Knarles the earnest&#xD;
champion of unmitigated villany; and it&#xD;
was with sensations of decided repugnance&#xD;
that he received his obsequious salute.&#xD;
"1 must beg you to state your business&#xD;
briefly; I am fully occupied," he said, curt-&#xD;
ly, motioning the lawye~' to a seat. Mr.&#xD;
Knarles had not completed his very pro-&#xD;
found obeisance, but he accepted the posi-&#xD;
tion with cheerfulness and alacrity.&#xD;
"I appreciate the value of your time,&#xD;
Mr. Wabs," he began, with bland equanim-&#xD;
ity. "It would be difficult to find any one&#xD;
in New York who could fail to do so, I am&#xD;
sure. I will occupy as little of it as the&#xD;
case admits. May I ask if we are entirely&#xD;
private here?"&#xD;
Quite," responded the banker, with&#xD;
some impatience, and still busy with his&#xD;
letters.&#xD;
"Excuse my pressing the point, sir, it is&#xD;
important."&#xD;
Mr. Wales turned off from the perusal of&#xD;
a portentous Western letter covering an&#xD;
infinitude of those highly illuminated drafts,&#xD;
such as the good men of the border delight&#xD;
in, and, turning in his chair, pointed to the&#xD;
door. "You ~a~,turn the key, sir, if you&#xD;
think it necessary.&#xD;
He thought he had divined the man's&#xD;

dered again at the hiatus occasioned in his&#xD;
check-book by such a customer. It deserves&#xD;
to be recorded that the amiable Mr. Knanles,&#xD;
on leaving the office of Wales, Burton, &amp;amp;&#xD;
Co., so far diverged from his usual habits of&#xD;
business as to drop down to Delmonico's&#xD;
and partake of a glass of hot brandy-and-&#xD;
water, for which indulgence he found a&#xD;
twofold excuse in his successful negotiation&#xD;
and the bad state of the streets.&#xD;
The banker sat tapping idly on his desk&#xD;
for a time, - a long time for him, in thse&#xD;
busy hours of work, - his eyes resting&#xD;
thoughtfully on the two slips of paper lying&#xD;
before him. The old cashier, who looked in&#xD;
for some instructions, saw something in his&#xD;
face which sent him away again on tiptoe.&#xD;
Then he gathered up the draft and receipt&#xD;
mechanically, and put them in a small side-&#xD;
drawer, the key of which he kept in his&#xD;
porte-monnaie. The absent look was still&#xD;
in his eyes as he closed and locked the&#xD;
same; they fell purposelessly upon the mass&#xD;
of unopened correspondence, and wandered,&#xD;
as by fateful chance, to a morning journal&#xD;
which lay partly folded on the desk. There&#xD;
they rested, rested long, until the old in-&#xD;
telligence seemed to flash back into them;&#xD;
and with a convulsive movement he reached&#xD;
out and took up the paper.&#xD;
It was only the "World"; but as it&#xD;
rested there an advertising column headed&#xD;
" Ocean ~ was conspicuously in&#xD;
view, and it was this heading which hat&#xD;
caught the banker's gaze. He ran down&#xD;
the list rapidly until his eye paused or&#xD;
the name of a steamer which was to sal&#xD;
two days later; the old, instinctive habii&#xD;
brought his pencil to the place anc&#xD;
marked it, and the paper was then care&#xD;
fully deposited in a pigeon-hole within&#xD;
reach. Then, without so much as the sigl&#xD;
which a younger heart heaves against it&#xD;
trouble, the man of business went back t4&#xD;
his business, and the cashier, looking h&#xD;
again, found in the busy worker, going o&#xD;
with his letters, the unchanged, untirin!&#xD;
"principal" of every day.&#xD;
"When Mr. Charles comes down, tel&#xD;
him I wish to see him, Burns."&#xD;
"Yes, sir; and the blank?"&#xD;
"I will give you a memorandum later&#xD;
remind me of it."&#xD;
In due course Mr. Wales came acros&#xD;
the hurried communication of Presiden&#xD;
Perkins, which, after reading it, he put I&#xD;
his pocket. The honorable directors of th&#xD;
Bank of Perkinsville received, the nea&#xD;
day, a letter from their~ INew York Corr(&#xD;
spondents containing the rather extraurd&#xD;
nary statement that their "No. 72 Bl&#xD;
Coin at sio'ht for $ 10,000," handed to 311&#xD;
Charles W'ales on the evening of the 17t&#xD;
instant, had been "accidentally destroyed.&#xD;
The amount, however, had been credited&#xD;
&#xD;
to their account in flaIl and instructions&#xD;
noted. "Would they kindly forward du-&#xD;
plicate draft at their earliest convenience?"&#xD;
The worthies of the up-country corporation&#xD;
wondered somewhat, but complied in&#xD;
all confidence, and thus the draft disap-&#xD;
peared forever from the surface of things.&#xD;
The old cashier received a memorandum for&#xD;
his blank " stump," - a charge of $10,000 to&#xD;
the private account of Mr. Wales. He was&#xD;
also instructed to credit the balance of the&#xD;
Perkinsvile National with a like amount,&#xD;
and charge the same to Profit and Loss&#xD;
without interest, against the arrival of their&#xD;
remittances, so that in the balance-sheet&#xD;
of Wales, Burton, &amp;amp; Co., that day, the&#xD;
house account stood debit $ 20,000, half&#xD;
of which was a knotted puzzle to all the&#xD;
working heads but one.&#xD;
When Charley passed the great office&#xD;
doors, where a rabble of nervous delivery-&#xD;
boys crowded the passage, the cashier found&#xD;
time over his lightning task to deliver the&#xD;
senior s message. The young man's heart&#xD;
sank at the words; they told him that his&#xD;
sin had already found him out, and for an&#xD;
instant he could almost have turned and&#xD;
fled, reading his guilt in every face. But&#xD;
he went in, passing by his associates with&#xD;
eyes on the floor and pale cheeks, making&#xD;
no response to their friendly greetings, -&#xD;
a strange discourtesy in Charley Wales.&#xD;
A bright-eyed clerk, running rapidly&#xD;
through a mass of bonds, noted at, and&#xD;
exchanged significant glances with his&#xD;
mate.&#xD;
I "Row on between the old un and Char-&#xD;

a What passed between father and son&#xD;
a within the locked inner office in the next&#xD;
s half-hour neither the curious employees&#xD;
nor the world ever knew. Charley came&#xD;
a out as he had gone in, and left. the place&#xD;
a with a dazed look on his face, and no word&#xD;
~ for any one. Outside, on the street steps,&#xD;
he paused and bared his burning head&#xD;
I mechanically to the cold breeze; it ached&#xD;
fearfully, but he was hardly conscious of&#xD;
the pain; and as he stood there with listless&#xD;
eyes wandering down the restless thorough-&#xD;
fare, a dreamy feeling was born of his&#xD;
s bewilderment which was deeper than ,any&#xD;
Lt sense ol physical distress. Strangely soft&#xD;
a and significant the familiar scene became&#xD;
e to him at that moment, with the 1a~t rays&#xD;
:t of the early winter sunset    the ici-&#xD;
~- des which clung to a thousand airy cor-&#xD;
i- ners of the spire of old Trinity, and glint-&#xD;
u ing down along the line of house-fronts to&#xD;
r. the bald colonnade of the Customs, and a&#xD;
b host of memories surged up within him at&#xD;
." the thought that it was the last time he&#xD;
:d should ever gaze upon it. Long ago he&#xD;
&#xD;
had felt a child's pride in the knowled~&#xD;
that his father was one of those great m&#xD;
who kept houses down there filled wil&#xD;
gold; he had gone down at long interval&#xD;
as he grew to boyhood, and watched wil&#xD;
wondering eyes and beating heart ti&#xD;
vast human machinery which worked&#xD;
swiftly and so faultlessly in the big office&#xD;
investing the picture with all the boy&#xD;
romance, and thrilling pleasantly at sigi&#xD;
of the name he bore staring down at all th&#xD;
passers-by in great gilt letters. He ha&#xD;
grown up ambitious to share in the labc&#xD;
and glory of this marvellous employment&#xD;
but it had proved hard and unsatisfying a]&#xD;
too soon, and the scene he gazed on no~&#xD;
had long ago turned cold and colorless&#xD;
enough. But in this moment a rare chang&#xD;
had fallen over it, - the melancholy inter&#xD;
est that clothes the face of a friend going&#xD;
long journey. Few men had ever throw&#xD;
the same amount of sentiment into th~&#xD;
sober lines of walk and wall in that feverish&#xD;
mart as did poor Chancy in those fee&#xD;
moments on the steps; but a sharp touci&#xD;
on the arm put it all to Thght.&#xD;
"Ilallo, Charley I one would think you&#xD;
had found a new architectural study, or v&#xD;
bit of charming scenery in the old street.&#xD;
judging by your artistic pose. Lucky ii&#xD;
you can; though, for that matter, a man in&#xD;
your shoes may build his 'castles in Spain&#xD;
where he likes, fine, five-storied, substantial&#xD;

eh? Egad! you may build yours even&#xD;
here, if you care to. That 's one picture;&#xD;
but only look at mine I Woe is me! There&#xD;
is Erie down a half, and Brooks sending&#xD;
that infernal red-headed oflice-boy up in&#xD;
hot haste for 'margin.' I call him my&#xD;
Spectre Rouge, and I believe he is ethereal;&#xD;
I shied a quarto of Kent at him the other&#xD;
day when he popped in, and it went through&#xD;
him; he stood there, unwinking and un-&#xD;
moved, when I had thouo~ht he would go&#xD;
down like a ten-pin." Ti'ie gossipy friend&#xD;
hooked arms with Charley, who walked up&#xD;
with him, mechanically, to the Broadway&#xD;
corner. "You look done up, old fellow. I&#xD;
saw you putting out with Dick Huntley last&#xD;
evening, and wondered what was on; none&#xD;
of my business, of course. Huatley 's a&#xD;
good fellow, is n't he? Only wish he would&#xD;
let one know him better."&#xD;
The name aroused Chancy; he excused&#xD;
himself to his friend, and clambered into&#xD;
an omnibus. The first settled thought he&#xD;
had had for hours came with the mention&#xD;
of Iluntley; it grew to be a feverish desire&#xD;
by the time he had reached and descended&#xD;
at the club. It was early, and there were&#xD;
only a few loungers in the parlors as he&#xD;
entered and sought out the steward.&#xD;
Simms met him with his unvarying smile.&#xD;
"Not pleasant out, Mr. Wales?"&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
D1cK.&#xD;
&#xD;
There was but one man among the host&#xD;
who called themselves his friends to whom&#xD;
Charley could have opened his heart in the&#xD;
strait int~ which he had come; that man&#xD;
was Huntley, and there was something&#xD;
more than disappointment in the deep feel-&#xD;
ing of loneliness, of utter helplessness, which&#xD;
weighed him down after the perusal of this&#xD;
untoward note. But the unselfish soul re-&#xD;
tained no bitterness for its frii~nd. "Poor&#xD;
Dick I I am always dragging him into&#xD;
some scrape; I wonder he has not dropped&#xD;
me long ago; any other man would,~ I fancy.&#xD;
What a fool I was!"&#xD;
He had conferred that unhlattering title&#xD;
on himself many times during this weary&#xD;
day, but never with more emphasis than at&#xD;
this moment, when the losses, - he could&#xD;
not recall whether they had been large or&#xD;
small, - and the inconvenience to which&#xD;
they might subject Huntley, filled his&#xD;
thoughts. He stood musing by the fire un-&#xD;
til people began to straggle in and arouse&#xD;

pay off some things for me. I will give you&#xD;
a memorandum o? them; they will foot up&#xD;

"Certainly, sir," and the celebrated wal-&#xD;
let made it~ appearance. "Goinrr out of&#xD;

"No - yes - that is, for some days;&#xD;
have you seen Huatley to-day?"&#xD;
"0, beg your pardon, sir, I had nearly&#xD;
forgotten it; there is a note here for you&#xD;
from him, I think."&#xD;
Simms hurried away and returned with&#xD;
the missive, which Charley tore open and&#xD;
read with eager haste.&#xD;
It was as follows:&#xD;
DEAR CHARI.EY, - I have just re-&#xD;
ceived a telegram from Sterns at Washing-&#xD;
ton; he has botched my business there, and&#xD;

but I find myself a penniless wretch this&#xD;
morning. Did I loan you anything? I hope&#xD;

&#xD;
him by their salutations; then he went into&#xD;
the street and walked slowly towards his&#xD;
home. It was quite dark now, and lights&#xD;
were gleaming softly in the windows as he&#xD;
passed up the avenue; he saw the swift&#xD;
shadows flitting across them, and pictured&#xD;
to himself the happy home-citcles in the&#xD;
warmth within. In his desolation he never&#xD;
paused to think that in each there brooded&#xD;
some heavy trouble like his own; he only&#xD;
saw in them the blessing of a home with a&#xD;
thousand sweet and sacred influences dwell-&#xD;
ing therein. They were not for him, and&#xD;
his steps grew slower as his young heart&#xD;
sank. Once he gathered a sudden resolution&#xD;
as the memory of the fair-faced girl of the&#xD;
morning flashed upon him; but the stern&#xD;
face of his father intercepted the sweet vis-&#xD;
ion the next instant, and his shame fell on&#xD;
his soul like a pall. He paused irresolutely&#xD;
on a street corner, and was standing there&#xD;
when an omnibus came clattering down.&#xD;
Scarcely conscious of what he did, he hailed&#xD;
it and got in; he could go anywhere, rest&#xD;
anywhere, now, but in his father's house,&#xD;
where every object seemed endowed with a&#xD;
pitiless and accusing voice.&#xD;
Huntley had written and dispatched&#xD;
more than one swift epistle in the busy half-&#xD;
hour at the hotel previous to his departure&#xD;
from town; and there had gone around to&#xD;
Mr. Samuel Worthington in 00th Street, by&#xD;
the same messenger that had conveyed the&#xD;
note to Charley at the club, a communica-&#xD;
tion of a different character. It was re-&#xD;
ceived and read by Mr. Worthington over&#xD;
a very late breakfast, a meal at which the&#xD;
obsequious Knarles enjoyed the unspeakable&#xD;
felicity of assisting, an honor bestowed&#xD;
probably in recognition of his successful ne-&#xD;
gotiation of the morning. Huntley briefly&#xD;
urged prompt action with the draft, - an en-&#xD;
tirely unnecessary proceeding as we have&#xD;
seen, - and closed with the words, "I am&#xD;
off to Philadelphia, as, whatever occurs, I&#xD;
am best out o he way; and in whatever&#xD;
does occur, I must not be involved. If any-&#xD;
thing special turns up, telegraph me at&#xD;
once at the Continental."&#xD;
Worthington perused the paper impas-&#xD;
sively, Mr. Knarles watching him covertly&#xD;
over his glass. That notable attorney had&#xD;
acquired some bad habits in the practice ol&#xD;
his profession, and could not wholly divest&#xD;
himself 'of them in private life; moreover&#xD;
his curiosity had been sadly piqued by tht&#xD;
events of the morning, and he thirsted fom&#xD;
more enlio'htenment than he had received&#xD;
from the "cautious gambler. It was nol&#xD;
every day that he could bring himself int&#xD;
such happy relations with a great man o&#xD;
the street, and he was beginning shrewdly&#xD;
to regret his too faithful pursuance of hi:&#xD;
client's interest and too slight recTard to hi&#xD;
own. He ventured at the thira glass o&#xD;
&#xD;
wine to remark innocently, "I was not&#xD;
aware that young Wales played; not a&#xD;
regular thing, is it?"&#xD;
Worthington repelled the gentle advance&#xD;
promptly.&#xD;
"We will not speak of the matter any&#xD;
further, if you please, Knarles," he said,&#xD;
coolly; "you have acquitted yourself satis-&#xD;
factorily, and we will not forget it; but it is&#xD;
desirable, for various reasons, to let the mat-&#xD;
ter drop."&#xD;
The lawyer smiled apologetically; but he&#xD;
suffered much self-condemnation on his way&#xD;
down town, visibly indicated by repeated&#xD;
sober shakings of his head, and, arrived at&#xD;
his office he sat down and entered in his&#xD;
private books a careful minute of the trans-&#xD;
action so far as he had figured therein, with&#xD;
shrewd addenda of inferences; when this&#xD;
was done, he indulged in a lengthy medi-&#xD;
tation, the conclusion of which was marked&#xD;
by a significant wrinkling of his brows&#xD;
and the philosophical ejaculation, "Who&#xD;
knows?"&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
OUT OF THE WAY.&#xD;
CHARLEY did not make his appearance&#xD;
at the breakfast-table the next morning at&#xD;
the Wales mansion, - a not uncommon oc-&#xD;
currence, to be sure; but Mr. Wales noticed&#xD;
it, and asked Stephen if his young master&#xD;
was at home. The old servant made a&#xD;
feeble effort to evade the truth, without&#xD;
uttering a direct falsehood. "I don't think&#xD;
he is up yet, sir," he s4d.&#xD;
It is not likely that the subterfuge de-&#xD;
ceived Mr. Wales, even partially; but he&#xD;
said no more, and the meal passed off in&#xD;
silence. There were present only the bank-&#xD;
er and the young girl of the morning, who,&#xD;
with the absent Cha{rley, composed the&#xD;
small family of which it behooves us now&#xD;
briefly to sketch the history.&#xD;
Mr. Edward Wales had been a hard-&#xD;
working man of business in Wall Street for&#xD;
forty years. He began as a youth of fifteen&#xD;
with the simple details in the office of Bur-&#xD;
ton Brothers, even then a prominent house,&#xD;
not, as I might have noted, in the Wall&#xD;
Street of to-day, but farther down in the&#xD;
antique shades of Beaver Street, from which&#xD;
the modern thoroughfare of finance received&#xD;
its earlier settlers. Tireless and ambitious,&#xD;
with exceptional abilities and a routine of&#xD;
life rigidly shaped to the groove, even in&#xD;
those early days, in which it was destined&#xD;
ever afterwards to run, he rose and pros-&#xD;
f pered in his place, until in time he assumed,&#xD;
without question, the foremost position&#xD;
among the working heads of the house.&#xD;
s At twenty-five he was the brain of the con-&#xD;
f cern. The principals were old men, driven&#xD;

that the awakening to the hard realities&#xD;

of his old poetical ~tructure, and the mi~&#xD;
ture of humiliation and disgust, followed&#xD;
swiftly iii his ease; but he held on bravel&#xD;
for a time, battling with the discouragement&#xD;
that confronted him and stifling the protein&#xD;
of his soul.&#xD;
Mrs. Howland's health suddenly faihe&#xD;
and in the following winter she came,&#xD;
pursuance of advice, to live in town. Mi&#xD;
Wales had previously left the house on th&#xD;
Square, where the innovation of glittering;&#xD;
signs and public tumults warned the quic&#xD;
dwellers beyond its limits, and taken up hi&#xD;
residence in one of a block of palaces on th&#xD;
Avenue, where his sister came, at his request&#xD;
and established herself with her daughter&#xD;
It was a brief period of comfort for then&#xD;
all during the winter. Mrs. Howland ral&#xD;
lied from her weakness, and Charley foun&#xD;
a priceless boon in the renewal of the old&#xD;
sweet association. Emma Howland wn&#xD;
blooming into beautiful womanhood, with&#xD;
rich inheritance of her mother's lovely auc&#xD;
noble nature; and even the banker relaxed&#xD;
in a measure from his frozen preoccupation&#xD;
in the changed atmosphere of his home, an~&#xD;
was conscious of a certain dim suspicion al&#xD;
times that his life had been barren of mucl~&#xD;
that was good and seemly.&#xD;
The spring that succeeded was that mem-&#xD;
orable one in which war woke from its&#xD;
sleep of fifty years, and walked forth in our&#xD;
land. Fred Howland was at Harvard, and&#xD;
from its patriotic shades, in those (lays of&#xD;
blazing enthusiasm, he was among the first&#xD;
tQ go to the field. He fell at Big Bethel by&#xD;
the side of Theodore Winthrop, and died in&#xD;
Charhey's arms a few days later at F6rtress&#xD;
Monroe. The blow killed his mother; not&#xD;
all at once, but it checked the improvement&#xD;
of her health, and with the autumn flowers&#xD;
she passed away. The blank that fell upon&#xD;
the young lives of Charley and his cousin,&#xD;
through her loss, cannot be expressed in&#xD;
words. More than the young man realized,&#xD;
perhaps, was it a loss to him at the time&#xD;
when he was beginning to drift away from&#xD;
his uncongenial task to wayward paths, im-&#xD;
*&amp;amp;   peeled, rather than checked, by the cold dis-&#xD;
pleasure of his father, to drift as he would&#xD;
never have done had the soft hand and&#xD;
mother voice of old been there to restrain&#xD;
him. -&#xD;
s      The few years which preceded the open-&#xD;
ing of this history were uneventful, yet still&#xD;
&#xD;
st memorable, because in them his distaste&#xD;
~y for business and proneness to unlawful dis-&#xD;
1t traction grew too strong for control. His&#xD;
is father gave him no moral help; he had never&#xD;
I cared fbr and scarcely understood the thou-&#xD;
~s sand nameless attractions in hifli which divide&#xD;
s- the thoughts and labor of most men; he no-&#xD;
d ticed only their influence in extreme cases,&#xD;
f and condemned them unexamined in the&#xD;
n mass. For his son he l]ad as little charity,&#xD;
~- if not less, than lie would have had fir the&#xD;
d most alien of his employees. But where he&#xD;
y would have crushed the wrong tendency in&#xD;
s the one, he met the other with a silent re-&#xD;
mt seatment infinitely harder to endure; and&#xD;
when, in time, he hurled the punishment on&#xD;
I, his son, it was without a warning~ word.&#xD;
n Chancy had looked forward to his admission&#xD;
into the house as a partner, on his cominct&#xD;
e of age, as a matter of course, and the expec-&#xD;
~ station had helped to restrain him in the&#xD;
t weary struggle. When the anniversary ar-&#xD;
s rive4, however, and was let pass without a&#xD;
~ movement in the direction of his advance-&#xD;
,, ment, he threw off the last bond of his alle-&#xD;
giance, and in his bitter humiliation aban-&#xD;
m doned the hope of any possible future sue-&#xD;
- cess in the office. He turned more fully&#xD;
I from that day into those attractive ways&#xD;
wherein the men of his age find solace and&#xD;
entertainment in the days of their youth, and,&#xD;
if less recklessly than most, with still as little&#xD;
I ambition for anything better or dread of&#xD;
I anything worse. He did not positively go&#xD;
down upon the black books of the world as&#xD;
I one of the undefined fraternity of "fast&#xD;
young men"; society dealt leniently with&#xD;
the great banker's son, and would still have&#xD;
smiled sweetly and sought its mildest ex-&#xD;
* pressing to the end for him, had his name&#xD;
been a synonym of vice; but there re-&#xD;
mnained for him a better influence, far stron-&#xD;
ger and dearer than even he dreanmed, which&#xD;
was ever a living shield between him and&#xD;
the grossest evil. The lessons of a child-&#xD;
hood such as his had been, the daily contact&#xD;
with natures as delicate and pure as his own,&#xD;
had wrought a bright and unfading strand&#xD;
in his character, which wotild strengthen the&#xD;
weaker man, and which, if it could not pre-&#xD;
vent his stumbling, would hehjin him in the&#xD;
effort to rise.&#xD;
At the breakfast-table that morning no&#xD;
further mention was made of the missing&#xD;
Chancy, but his father wrote a brief note,&#xD;
before leaving for the office, to be handed to&#xD;
his son when he should come down. As&#xD;
the banker withdrew, his eye met the anx-&#xD;
ious glance of his niece, and he paused an&#xD;
instant in evident hesitation; then he passed&#xD;
out quickly, covering his departure by some&#xD;
last injunction to the servant.&#xD;
Charhey came in later in the morning, and&#xD;
met his cousin on his way up stairs. She&#xD;
seemed to have been watching for him, but&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7944-00000012"/>&#xD;
22                                0110&#xD;
he only addressed her with his ordinary&#xD;
salute, and went hurriedly to his room.&#xD;
Here he read the communication from his&#xD;
father. "I must remind you," it said, "that&#xD;
you have but twenty-four hours to make&#xD;
your final preparations in. I will attend to&#xD;
everything down town, so that it will not be&#xD;
necessary for you to revisit the office, and I&#xD;
will see you when you go. I haie said&#xD;
nothing of the matter to your cousin, and&#xD;
would recommend you to leave all explana-&#xD;
tion to me."&#xD;
He sat some time ruminating over the&#xD;
lines. He looked as if he had not slept,&#xD;
and seemed to have been drinking, - drink-&#xD;
ing as a man sometimes does in the vain&#xD;
effort to drown his thoughts. Something&#xD;
like defiance had flashed into his face at&#xD;
the first reading of the note, hut it, died&#xD;
away again into a gloomy shadow, which&#xD;
grew infinitely sad as his heavy eyes wan-&#xD;
dered over his pretty room, so full of the&#xD;
happy souvenirs of his young life. From&#xD;
the walls pictured faces looked down upon&#xD;
him, - that of his aunt, with her grave, sweet&#xD;
smile, faced the strange and severe visage&#xD;
of his forgotten another, copied by his own&#xD;
hand from the great, staring portrait of&#xD;
twenty years before, which hung down&#xD;
stairs; and side by side, in the sunlight, his&#xD;
two cousins - the brave boy sleeping at&#xD;
Old Point Comfort, and the fair-faced girl&#xD;
he had passed on the stair - gazed at him&#xD;
with loving eyes. He looked long at the&#xD;
last; it also was the work of his hand, and&#xD;
one upon which he had spent all his skill.&#xD;
He remembered well the burst of applause&#xD;
which had greeted its first exhibition, long&#xD;
before, to the circle at the country home;&#xD;
and while he studied its girlish features -&#xD;
the pretty, uxifilled shadow of the beautiful&#xD;
woman-face of to-day - the crushed paper&#xD;
dropped from his hand, and two big tears,&#xD;
which would no longer he repressed, rolled&#xD;
down his cheeks. Then he aroused himself&#xD;
with a start: "Heigho! What should&#xD;
such fellows as I do? I wonder if Prince&#xD;
Hamlet would have gambled and stolen?"&#xD;
- the word caine hard -" perhaps, if lie&#xD;
had been Charley Wales." And if Horatio&#xD;
had been Dick Huntley! He went to work&#xD;
th~h sharply. He would not have Stephen&#xD;
in to ask questions or worry his old head;&#xD;
so he ~lmgged out a large trunk from the&#xD;
closet and threw it open, disclosing a choice&#xD;
assortment of fishing-togs which had done&#xD;
service the summer previous at Minot's&#xD;
Ledge. Then he gathered some armfuls of&#xD;
effects from the vast repository of his ward-&#xD;
robe, and, tossing them on the floor, stood&#xD;
thereafter in the midst of them, an amusing&#xD;
picture of helplessness, despite his sad face.&#xD;
Afterwards he did better. What did it&#xD;
matter, indeed? A few things carelessly&#xD;
and hurriedly put in; some little treasures,&#xD;
&#xD;
dSY.                                                 OUT OF THE WAY.&#xD;
&#xD;
less carelessly selected, from the store of&#xD;
souvenirs on his table; a book or two, some&#xD;
photographs, and a packet of letters, - and&#xD;
the task was done. He closed and locked the&#xD;
trunk, and tossed the remaining things igno-&#xD;
miniously back into the closet just as Stephen&#xD;
summoned him to luncheon. As he entered&#xD;
the dining-room, struggling hard to look un-&#xD;
concerned, his cousin met him with a&#xD;
troubled face, and, drawing' near, laid her&#xD;
hand softly on his shoulder. ~" Charley, what&#xD;
is the matter? I know something has hap-&#xD;
pened between yoi~ and your father."&#xD;
"We have not quarrelled, Em, if that 's&#xD;
what you mean," he said with a smile.&#xD;
She looked fixedly at him, without seem~&#xD;
ing to notice the words, and his gaze&#xD;
avoided hers uneasily. "You are going&#xD;
away," she said.&#xD;
Charley looked alarmed. "No! - that is&#xD;
- what made you think that ~&#xD;
"I hear you packing in your room."&#xD;
He was at a loss, and stood silent some&#xD;
moments, digging his boot in the thick car-&#xD;
pet with eyes downcast. Then he looked&#xD;
up sadly, hut spoke with quiet resolution:&#xD;
"You are right, Em, something has hap-&#xD;
pened, but 1 can't tell you what; at least&#xD;
not just now. Don't ask me, please."&#xD;
She grew paler, and her hand trembled&#xD;
slightly, but sl]e kept it on his shoulder.&#xD;
"Then you are going away?"&#xD;
"Yes, 1 am - not far - that is, not for&#xD;
long, I hope. Shall you care much?" The&#xD;
words were uttered thoughtlessly, and he&#xD;
looked in her eyes as he spoke. They fell&#xD;
a moment, but met his own again full and&#xD;
warm in the next.&#xD;
"You know I shall care, Charley. What&#xD;
should I do without you? And then to have&#xD;
you go away dn bad terms with uncle!"&#xD;
"No worse than usual," lie broke in, bit-&#xD;
terly. The brief flash of feeling had died&#xD;
as it came.&#xD;
'.' I wish we could all he happier here,"&#xD;
she said with a sigh. "Don't you think&#xD;
you could be if you tried 2- with yodr&#xD;
father, I mean."&#xD;
He turned away to the table at the words.&#xD;
"1 should not make the effort, even if he&#xD;
gave mc the chance, which is n't likely; it&#xD;
is n't worth talking about. Let 's eat our&#xD;
lunch and be jolly."&#xD;
It was not jolly, however, despite his&#xD;
well-sustained efforts to make it so. His&#xD;
cousin w~is thoughtful and troubled through-&#xD;
out, and at the conclusion stopped him&#xD;
quickly, when he made a strategical effort&#xD;
to leave the room. "When do you go?"&#xD;
she asked.&#xD;
"To-morrow, or next day. Why, how&#xD;
worried you look because I can't tell you&#xD;
all about it! Don't you see, it may be one&#xD;
of those terrible business affairs, - crisis at&#xD;
the Bank of Son'mething, - delinquent cash-&#xD;
&#xD;
icr, and I a special emissary to protect th&#xD;
gigantic interests of Wales, Burton, &amp;amp; Co&#xD;
bound in the nature of business to conduct&#xD;
my operations with the tremendous mystcr~&#xD;
appropriate to the case. You poor pusm&#xD;
don't bother your brain about it! I wil&#xD;
see you again, - must go down town now&#xD;
Au rcvoir!" And he got away, leaving he&#xD;
no whit relieved.&#xD;
She went to her own room with an anx&#xD;
ious and sinking heart, and sat awhile is&#xD;
troubled thought; then she yielded to th(&#xD;
temptation of her fears, and stole up t&#xD;
Charley's room only to find the door locked&#xD;
and the key gone, - a state of things with&#xD;
out precedent, and which sent her back tc&#xD;
her chamber more alarmed than before. Al&#xD;
last she rang for Stephe~m. The good old&#xD;
man had been her mother's servant, and&#xD;
had watched and loved the cousins from their&#xD;
earliest years. He looked distressed as he&#xD;
came in.&#xD;
"Did you want me, Miss Emmie?"&#xD;
"Yes, I wished to ask you - Stephen,&#xD;
I 'm afraid something very serious has oc-&#xD;
curred between Mr. Charles and hi~ father."&#xD;
Stephen shuffled uneasily before the in-&#xD;
quiring gaze of his young mistress. He&#xD;
possessed an endless sympathy for her, but&#xD;
he was discretion itself, and he had con-&#xD;
ceived, moreover, a wholesome respect for&#xD;
the senior Wales, which, in these later years,&#xD;
had in no small measure subdued the once&#xD;
lively tendencies of his tongue. "I hope&#xD;
not, Miss Emmie," he said, - "I hope not.&#xD;
You know they have some little difThrence&#xD;
atween 'em, but that will all come right in&#xD;
time. Mr: Charles is very yo]ng, you see,&#xD;
Miss Enimie. Why, it seems on'y yestcr-&#xD;
day-~~&#xD;
"Yes, I know, Stephen, but I think there&#xD;
is something - something dreadful now.&#xD;
Charley is going away."&#xD;
"Bless you, Miss Emmie, you don't mean&#xD;
it!"&#xD;
"Yes; he has been packing all the morn-&#xD;
mug.&#xD;
"I am astonishedd to hear you. Packing?&#xD;
Why, Mr. Charles never packed his own&#xD;
trunk in his lifi~!" And Stephen~s incre-&#xD;
dulity got the better of his anxiety for the&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
"But he did to-day, and he told me he&#xD;
was going away. Don't you know anything&#xD;
about it, Stephen? Don't you know what&#xD;
was in the note his father left for him this&#xD;
morning'?"&#xD;
He looked at her reproachfully. "Bless&#xD;
you, Miss Emmie, how should I? I will&#xD;
tell you," he added, after a sober pause,&#xD;
"all I saw, though I ought n't, because it&#xD;
was not for me to see. After I gave Mr.&#xD;
Charles the note this morning, I thought&#xD;
he might want some breakfast, so I went up&#xD;
again, and knocked at his door. I knocked&#xD;
&#xD;
23&#xD;
&#xD;
e three times, Miss Emmie, and got no an-&#xD;
swer; then, thinks 1, perhaps he is ill or&#xD;
t needs something, so I made bold to open&#xD;
~' the door. There I saw him sitting , very sol-&#xD;
, cmn-like, on a chair, Miss Emmie," con-&#xD;
I tinned the old man, and his voice grew&#xD;
- tremulous in the recital, "with the paper in&#xD;
r his hand; but he was n't a reading' of it, he&#xD;
was looking up at the picture of poor Mr.&#xD;
- Frederick on the wall, absent-like, and the&#xD;
tears was running' down his cheeks. I shut&#xD;
the door, then, very soft, and came away~&#xD;
I would n't 'a' told this to any one but you,&#xD;
I Miss Eminic."&#xD;
He drew his sleeve across his eyes as he&#xD;
concluded, but Emma did not see it. It was&#xD;
growing dark in the room, but had the old&#xD;
man's eyes been less dim he might have seen&#xD;
by the firelight her own tears falling thick&#xD;
and fast. There was silence after this, until&#xD;
he said witlvwn effort," Thank you; that is&#xD;
all, Stephen."&#xD;
As the door closed on the servant her&#xD;
head sank wearily forward into her hands,&#xD;
and the great dread at her heart welled&#xD;
up in unrestrained and almost convulsive&#xD;
weeping. The scene so simply pictured by&#xD;
Stephen confirmed her fears; what it was&#xD;
she knew not, but that something had&#xD;
occurred to rob her not very happy home&#xD;
of its single bright presence was no longer&#xD;
to be doubted. She made an effort and&#xD;
went down when the dinner-bell rang.&#xD;
Charley had not come home, and Mr. Wales&#xD;
sat in his place more silent and stern than&#xD;
she had ever seen him. She burned to ask&#xD;
him for some explanation, but his face for-&#xD;
bade her, and she excused herself, in sheer&#xD;
inability to bear up longer in his presence,&#xD;
and hurried from the untasted meal to her&#xD;
own room. Here she kept watch with her&#xD;
tears, struggling with the terror and faint-&#xD;
ness of her heart, and longing, 0 so bitterly!&#xD;
for that mother's help and the dead brother's&#xD;
hand in this hour of peril. Far into the&#xD;
night she sat thus, and then lay sleepless,&#xD;
still straining her ears painfully for the&#xD;

desperately, "0 uncle! do tell me what is&#xD;
the trouble with Charley. Why is he go..&#xD;

The banker looked at her not unkindly,&#xD;
almost pitifully.&#xD;
"I will tell you to-night, Emma. You&#xD;
must not be distressed; we will do all for&#xD;
the best."&#xD;
She had to be content with this, for she&#xD;
felt the uttem~ hopelessness of demanding&#xD;
more. The banker going out -to his carriage&#xD;
carried with him the picture of the pale,&#xD;
strained face, so like the Ellen Wales of&#xD;

THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.               25&#xD;
&#xD;
In a word, he was a success. In the fe&#xD;
years he had lived in the financial mart I&#xD;
studied silently the field, and, entering&#xD;
afterwards as an active man, he pushed h&#xD;
way rapi(lly to the front, with a subtle ma:&#xD;
tery of all the details of business, and&#xD;
clear insight into its mysteries which noti&#xD;
ing escaped. It needed only that he shoul&#xD;
secure a footing within the select circle&#xD;
the great houses, and obtain the protection&#xD;
and endorsement of some one among them&#xD;
once established in that coign of vantage~&#xD;
his course was clear and the end assured&#xD;
It will be imagined that he soon founi&#xD;
means to accomplish that object, and th&#xD;
modes will bear description.&#xD;
The young house of Iluntley &amp;amp; Co. coul&#xD;
not claim to be a heavy lender of money&#xD;
but it was known to carry hamidsome hal&#xD;
'ances at times, and was quite high on the list,&#xD;
of the borrowers. One afternoon they had ar&#xD;
application for fifty thousand dollars from r&#xD;
small neighbor. Huntley was in the office&#xD;
at the time, and, though fully aware of hh&#xD;
inability to accommodate them at the&#xD;
moment, he did not omit to examine the&#xD;
collateral. Something about them fastened&#xD;
his attention; he was a very clever judge&#xD;
of securities, and he made careful notes&#xD;
before handing them back to the bearer.&#xD;
"Sorry I can't serve you," he said, "but&#xD;
we have drawn lower than I supposed; try&#xD;
Brooks, or, still better, perhaps, Wales, Bur-&#xD;
ton."&#xD;
The clerk hurried away. Huntley sent&#xD;
a boy to watch him, made some pencil notes&#xD;
from memory, and awaited the return of his&#xD;
spy, who came back directly.&#xD;
" Well ?" he asked.&#xD;
"Made his loan at Wales, Burton, sir.&#xD;
The broker called in at the great house&#xD;
at an early hour the following morning and&#xD;
requested a private audience of Mr. Wales,&#xD;
who received him politely; he was not&#xD;
unknown to the banker, but he was on the&#xD;
latter's list of" new men," - a class he dealt&#xD;
with cautiously.&#xD;
"I will not apologize for taking your&#xD;
time, Mr. Wales," he said, "the matter is&#xD;
one of confidence, and I come in the pro-&#xD;
tection of mutual interests. I recommended&#xD;
a party to your house for money, last night,&#xD;
- Stevens and Leonard. Do you happen&#xD;
to know it' you loaned them anything?"&#xD;
"We did."&#xD;
"Fifty thousand, was it not, on a thou-&#xD;
sand Erie?"&#xD;
"I think so. I will inquire-"&#xD;
"Will you also allow me to see the col-&#xD;
laterals?"&#xD;
"Certainly."&#xD;
The securities were brought, and, drawing&#xD;
a memorandum from his pocket, Huntley&#xD;
compared some numbers and further ex-&#xD;
amined the certificates; ten of Erie Railway&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
w common stock of one hundred shares each.&#xD;
ie It was a rapid, though thorough, inspection,&#xD;
it at the conclusion of which he exclaimed,&#xD;
is "I was afi'aid of it! they are altered certifi-&#xD;
s- cates, Mr. Wales!"&#xD;
a "Is it possible?"&#xD;
"I am sorry to say it is undoubted. I&#xD;
d regret to have been the cause, perhaps, of&#xD;
f your taking them in; but I was on the&#xD;
n point of advancing the loan myself, when&#xD;
my cashier informed me we could not do it.&#xD;
I had already taken the numbers in pencil&#xD;
I. at the moment. By the merest accident,&#xD;
I having some Erie transfers to make this&#xD;
a morning, I noticed the rather uncommon&#xD;
entry of ten shares in one-share lots upon&#xD;
I the hook. The name struck me at once. I&#xD;
asked to see thej stumps' and compared these&#xD;
- numbers, which I fortunately had about me.&#xD;
They are the same certificates, sir, altered&#xD;
to a hundred shares each!"&#xD;
Of course, Wales, Burton, &amp;amp; Co. lost no&#xD;
time in securing themselves, which they&#xD;
were barely in time to do, by attaching the&#xD;
bank account of the eccentric gentlemen,&#xD;
Messrs. Stevens and Leonard; and of&#xD;
course, Mr. Huntley secured the most valu-&#xD;
able patrons he could have had, perhaps, in&#xD;
the street, and with them the position to&#xD;
which he aspired. He was, henceforth, a&#xD;
frequent and cordially received visitor at&#xD;
their office; and the moral effect - the&#xD;
moral effects of Wall Street are peculiar -&#xD;
of his coup was to give him the confidence&#xD;
of men, and procure for him an increase of&#xD;
business and opportunities.&#xD;
Charley Wales thus came to see more of&#xD;
the man with whom he had previously en-&#xD;
joyed a speaking acquaintance at the club,&#xD;
and who had always possessed a certain&#xD;
attraction for him, - as he did, indeed, for&#xD;
every one.&#xD;
Charley sought and cultivated a more&#xD;
intimate intercourse, which we were all&#xD;
surprised to see freely accorded; and it was&#xD;
said at the Mayflower that Dick Huntley&#xD;
had at last found his "man 'Friday." It&#xD;
was less difficult to explain the intimacy on&#xD;
the youimg man's side, for there could hardly&#xD;
have been a character more attractive to him&#xD;
than that of this passed man of the world, who&#xD;
carried under his calm exterior the rich and&#xD;
varied experiemmee of his class, and who,&#xD;
when he chose to put away the sober day-&#xD;
dress of his life, as he sometimes did for&#xD;
Charley, showed beneath the real warmth&#xD;
and passion of his nature. To Charley he&#xD;
opened the closed pages of a singularly&#xD;
eventful career; not all of them, indeed,&#xD;
nor any that were too darkly shaded, but&#xD;
very many of that tenor which fascinates an&#xD;
impressible nature like that of his young&#xD;
friend. Nothing could have equalled the&#xD;
charm which the latter found in the fabric&#xD;
of reminiscences dealing with other lands&#xD;

&#xD;
and the great and small people thereof, and&#xD;
checkered with the adventures of a clever&#xD;
but rather reckless young man to whom&#xD;
Continental life was a solved problem at an&#xD;
age when most men are entering upon its&#xD;
investigation. From these detached bits of&#xD;
his history Chancy gathered in time what&#xD;
formed a half-connected train of events.&#xD;
Iluntley was a younger son of a good&#xD;
family - as Chancy suspected, a titled one&#xD;
- in England, ~nd had gone out to India&#xD;
with his regiment at an early age, to hold&#xD;
his own as best he might in that hotbed of&#xD;
nature and social life. The traditions of a&#xD;
tempestuous youth were not ignored: in the&#xD;
colonial world, Charley judged, but on this&#xD;
period of his life Iluntley touched very&#xD;
lightly. He came back after some years to&#xD;
England, - a circumstance which seemed to&#xD;
have received no attention at the War Of-&#xD;
fice, - and subsequently went on the Con-&#xD;
tinent as an atlache', where he floated frbm&#xD;
embassy to embassy for more than ten years;&#xD;
and it was this interval which furnished the&#xD;
sparkling souvenirs which were Charley's&#xD;
delight. Of the circumstances which led&#xD;
to his emigration to America, Huntley never&#xD;
spoke, and Charley did not seek to know;&#xD;
the barrier of reserve peculiar to the man&#xD;
was never entirely removed, even for him.&#xD;
The intimacy was naturally the subject of&#xD;
considerable, and not always very charitable,&#xD;
remark among the rather outspoken mem-&#xD;
bers of the Mayflower club for a time; but I&#xD;
am certain that when Iluntley began to come&#xD;
more among us with Charley, and, relaxing&#xD;
from his former reticence, showed us at&#xD;
times something of the unsuspected man&#xD;
within, there was not one of the observant&#xD;
company who failed to feel the rare charm&#xD;
of his presence, or wondered longer at Char-&#xD;
ley's preference. Old Byrnes would have&#xD;
his growl. It had been his privilege to&#xD;
know Aaron Burr, and to him he was fain&#xD;
to lik~n Dick Huntley in manner and ap-&#xD;
pearance; hut he, too, would look up from&#xD;
the columns of his paper and listen as&#xD;
attentively as the rest of us when the broker&#xD;
had the floor.&#xD;
Huntley was an occasional guest at the&#xD;
Wales mansion. Charley had met with an&#xD;
unusually gracious. response when he first&#xD;
proposed his friend's company at his father's&#xD;
table, and his boyish ambition to exhibit&#xD;
the pro(ligy to his cousin led to many&#xD;
subsequent visits. There were very many&#xD;
pleasant evenings indeed in the grand&#xD;
parlors, where the handsome and fascinating&#xD;
broker came soon enough to be the centre&#xD;
of attraction for all eyes and ears. He&#xD;
went very little into society, and seldom&#xD;
except with Charley, but he met every-&#xD;
where with the same smiling reception;&#xD;
questions of antecedents were forgotten in&#xD;
the great fact that he was a brilliant and&#xD;
&#xD;
rising man; and the patronage of the Wales&#xD;
family was itself a guaranty which silenced&#xD;
any captious inquiries. At the social&#xD;
events at the Wales niansion he was soon&#xD;
an unfailing light; he grew, in fact, to be&#xD;
their crowning feature in the feminine&#xD;
esteem; and if any delicate argument some-&#xD;
times arose in some fair bosom as to the&#xD;
propriety of attending the "Wales party"&#xD;
or the " XVales musical" because Mr.&#xD;
Charles Wales hadTheen neglectfiml in his&#xD;
calls or Miss lowland and her friend and&#xD;
chaperone, Mrs. White Jennings, similarly&#xD;
remiss in their conventional duties, it was&#xD;
more than answered in the reflection that&#xD;
"Mr. Huntley was sure to be there!"&#xD;
And so, in truth, he was, and his faithful&#xD;
presence at the banker's house ultimately&#xD;
gave rise to certain pleasant conjectures in&#xD;
which Mr. Charles ceased to figure as the&#xD;
explaining cause; very many good people&#xD;
foresaw at once a happy alliance for the&#xD;
broker, which was quite in pursuance of&#xD;
their previous prognostications respecting&#xD;
Mr. Huntley's future, and on the 'Change of&#xD;
gossip the matter speedily became an&#xD;
accepted fact. That the possibility had&#xD;
dawned on his own mind at an early day is&#xD;
also true; he never lost sight of the utmost&#xD;
reach of his opportunities, or failed to weigh&#xD;
them promptly and thoroughly; and the&#xD;
advantages offered to him at Charley's&#xD;
home were carefully considered by him&#xD;
from the first. He did not immediately&#xD;
determine upon action, for there existed&#xD;
some formidable objections to marriage&#xD;
in his case; but the project grew upon him&#xD;
insensibly, even while he reasoned with him-&#xD;
self on its impracticability, until he had half&#xD;
mechanically entered upon its execution. It&#xD;
is possible that he would still and indefinitely&#xD;
have pursued that course in the half-consent-&#xD;
ing and half-resisting spirit in which men's&#xD;
dispositions beguile their judgments, but&#xD;
that a sudden rude shock aroused him to a&#xD;
perception of an unsuspected obstacle, put&#xD;
an altogether new face on the situation, and&#xD;
left him the choice of withdrawal or of&#xD;
entering formally into what promised to be&#xD;
a difficult campaign. The obstacle was, in&#xD;
truth, a tremendous one. To say that his&#xD;
reception at the banker's had been warm&#xD;
and encouraging scarcely expresses the&#xD;
unreserved friendliness which Mr. Wales&#xD;
manifested for the successful man of the&#xD;
street, and the equally unquestioning re~&#xD;
gard shown by Miss lowland for her&#xD;
cousin's friend; there had never been any&#xD;
abatement of either, and he was able to&#xD;
measure with satisfaction the evident pleas-&#xD;
ure ienived from his company by all alike,&#xD;
and especially, perhaps, by the young&#xD;
woman, to whom, as to Chancy, the man&#xD;
was a revelation; it was only when he ven-&#xD;
tured, with delicate empressernent, a nearer&#xD;
&#xD;
approach to her, that he met with a ver&#xD;
perceptible element of repulsion. Too war&#xD;
to commit an indiscretion, he did not imme&#xD;
diately repeat the experiment; but a sul&#xD;
sequent moment of encouragement havin~&#xD;
offered itself; he made a second advance&#xD;
and was received with a cold surprise whic]&#xD;
completely baffled him, while it stung hin&#xD;
into consciousness. He awoke sharply ti&#xD;
the knowledge of an unseen lion in th&#xD;
path; but on9e awakened, it needed no lonl&#xD;
time for the clear eye to penetrate thii&#xD;
shadow to the fact, and to reduce that a&#xD;
well to its exact proportions.&#xD;
Emma lowland loved her cousin, - th~&#xD;
laughing, careless boy, whose fondness fo:&#xD;
her, if it had possibly a deeper root, ha(&#xD;
never taken, he was sure, the form anc&#xD;
semblance of love. The discovery Was noi&#xD;
a flattering one to Huntley, who held m&#xD;
small opinion of his own merits and capa&#xD;
abilities with the sex; but he did not allow&#xD;
the feeling to blind him to the strength am]&#xD;
endurance of the woman's affection, which,&#xD;
as he very correctly estimated, was th&#xD;
growth of years of intimate association, aiid&#xD;
a sentiment closely latwined with her wl~ok&#xD;
life.&#xD;
The revelation brought on a crisis in&#xD;
Huntley's life. His first confused resolve&#xD;
was to leave the field, to leave Charley to&#xD;
the ultimate and inevitable enjoyment of&#xD;
the rare love and the rare woman who&#xD;
waited only to be asked, and to whom, as&#xD;
he could so clearly foresee, the unthinking&#xD;
boy of to-day would turn some other day in&#xD;
a 5u(lden awakening of his own man's heart.&#xD;
'ihis first true impulse was only natural&#xD;
on Huntley's part, for he had liked Char-&#xD;
ley, liked him for himself, and made him&#xD;
as much his friend as it was possible&#xD;
for the man to make any one; but in&#xD;
the tumult of thought and feeling which&#xD;
followed it, the boy was but a straw tossed&#xD;
in the passionate flood of the elder's&#xD;
soul.&#xD;
XVhy give it up? Why give her up?&#xD;
Ay! iman!&#xD;
Hantley stopped short in a mad prome-&#xD;
nade of his own chamber, and faced his re-&#xD;
flection in the mirror. It was not an un-&#xD;
common thing for him to do; and as for&#xD;
that he might search far and long to find&#xD;
the equal of the splendid face with its deep&#xD;
black eyes and wonderful power of expres-&#xD;
smon which looked out at him at that mo-&#xD;
ment, - looked out with a strange light upon&#xD;
~    it, and a curve iii the lips which was half&#xD;
smile, half sarcasm. Many a time had he&#xD;
thus faced the man in the glass, and held&#xD;
excited debate with the emotionless shadow.&#xD;
~    It nerved an~ cooled him to do so; and&#xD;
in more than o~me dark passage of his life it&#xD;
had been a singularly strengthening thought&#xD;
to him that, come what might, the creature&#xD;
&#xD;
y before him would be the same magnificent&#xD;
y work of nature still.&#xD;
"Is it you, Dick Huntley?" asked the&#xD;
shade, with the curve deepening about the&#xD;
g mouth, - "really you, and after all these&#xD;
, years and all your lessons? Just now, too,&#xD;
Ii when you have your future in your hands,&#xD;
a and a weakness would be fatal. J'shaw!&#xD;
o what is it? A pretty girl's heart, a brief&#xD;
e tale of legendary 'bliss.' You ought to&#xD;
~ know what that is worth, and what it&#xD;
e sometimes costs I "&#xD;
s The face was a sneering devil's now. He&#xD;
did not like it, and resumed his walk with-&#xD;
m out calling up his visionary guest again.&#xD;
r The struggle was a fierce~ one, but it was&#xD;
I brief, as with him any struggle must be.&#xD;
I He ended it by tossing his cigar in the grate&#xD;
and tossing himself upon a lounge with a&#xD;
ninoino' lauo-h. "Egad I there 'II be merri-&#xD;
- mne~t % heYl to-night! And now, travail-&#xD;
ions!"&#xD;
The good woman who had the honor to&#xD;
be Mr. Huntley's landlady, and who was at&#xD;
that moment an aifrighted listener at his&#xD;
keyhole, did not possess, fortunately, a&#xD;
knowledge of the Continental languages;&#xD;
had she done so, she would have been inex-&#xD;
pressibly shocked by the nature as well as&#xD;
the expression of these last words, and&#xD;
have seen in the smiling gentleman who&#xD;
came out some moments later, and passed&#xD;
her with a bow in the hall, nothing less&#xD;
than Mephistopheles "warm from his bed";&#xD;
and she would not have been far wrong,&#xD;
figuratively speaking.&#xD;
Huntley's intercourse with the family at&#xD;
the house on the avenue went on as before;&#xD;
he had experienced one nervous tremor in&#xD;
approaching Miss Howlaid again, but her&#xD;
manner indicated no recollection of the&#xD;
circumstance we have noted, and the broker&#xD;
was careful to avoid the dangerous ground&#xD;
whereon he had slipped. As for Emma,&#xD;
she led herself easily to believe that she&#xD;
had erred in being startled at all, and even&#xD;
chided herself for the momentary emotion&#xD;
she had felt. There had been a vague&#xD;
shadow which rose when Huntley came&#xD;
again, but this faded before his guarded&#xD;
manner, and under the convi6tion that she&#xD;
had misjudged him, she labored to efface&#xD;
the effect, if there might be any, by in-&#xD;
creased kindness towards him. Huntley&#xD;
read the simple girl-heart as he would have&#xD;
rea~l an opened book, and shaped his course&#xD;
thereby. He shut up his secret in his soul,&#xD;
and gave no sign; but he went out to'his&#xD;
work with watchful eyes, and with every&#xD;
faculty of his being centered on the attaiji-&#xD;
ment of his hopes. The situation was&#xD;
difficult. There could be no progress for&#xD;
him so long as Chancy remained on the&#xD;
scene, and everything hung on the removal&#xD;
or the destruction of the obstacle. No&#xD;

wonder that Mr. Huntley wrinkled his fine&#xD;
brows of nights over the problem, or that in&#xD;
his vexed heart the friendship for his young&#xD;
friend curdled quickly into bitter hate.&#xD;
Who stood in this man's way was his ene-&#xD;

deeper resentment than against the warm-&#xD;
hearted boy who had been the chosen inti-&#xD;

We have seen how chance, true to the&#xD;
interests of this man-waif, who was its devo-&#xD;

find an answer to the question which was&#xD;
ever in his thoughts after the night at&#xD;
Worthington's, as to what would be the re-&#xD;

variety of sequences, all having a general&#xD;
conclusion, and pointing to a more or less&#xD;
complete estrangement between father and&#xD;
son, and partial or permanent banishment&#xD;
of the latter from the office in Wall Street,&#xD;
and from New York. He hoped it, without&#xD;
daring to expect it, and pictured to him-&#xD;
self a possible exile to some Western city&#xD;
as the likeliest result. More than this he&#xD;
had scarcely anticipated, and it may be&#xD;
imagined with what exultation he read&#xD;
the telegram, and broke the silence of his&#xD;
room with the ringing words, "Cit va&#xD;
bien I"&#xD;
It had indeed "gone well," better by&#xD;
some thousand miles of sea than he had&#xD;
ventured in his wildest thought to hope.&#xD;
It was all he asked. The boy was far re-&#xD;
moved now; his be the task to keep him&#xD;
away.&#xD;
He called in at the banker's on his arri-&#xD;
val, and was received somewhat nervously&#xD;
by the latter. "I have been over to Phila-&#xD;
delphia, Mr. Wales," he said, in ordinary&#xD;
business tone, "and I find, as I expected,&#xD;
that there is no life in that quicksilver af-&#xD;
fair; nothing doing or likely to be done in&#xD;
it, and I think Simpson must ~mave been&#xD;
misinformed."&#xD;
"Ah I-yes, probably," responded the&#xD;
banker, rather absently. He was busy with&#xD;
some papers, and did not look up at the&#xD;
speaker.&#xD;
Huntley experienced a little uncomforta-&#xD;
ble thrill. "All well, I trust, Mr. Wales, at&#xD;
your house, - Miss lowland and Charley,&#xD;
- I missed him outside." He watched the&#xD;
banker like a hawk, andsaw him recover&#xD;
himself sharply at the name, and pause&#xD;
before speaking.&#xD;
"You will be surprised to learn that my&#xD;
son has gone away."&#xD;
"Gone away I I beg your pardon -"&#xD;
Huntley was the picture of amazement&#xD;
&#xD;
and concern, as the banker turned in his&#xD;
chair, and added, "He sailed for England&#xD;
yesterday. The event is one which in-&#xD;
volves some painful explanations, and I beg&#xD;
you will allow me to make them at some&#xD;
future time."&#xD;
Huntley bowed in silence.&#xD;
"As you circulate somewhat among his&#xD;
acquaintance," continued Mr. Wales, in&#xD;
some embarrassment, and fumbling with a&#xD;
check-cutter, "I had thought of asking you,&#xD;
Mr. iluntley, as my son's friend, to confer&#xD;
a favor on us. His abrupt departure~)will&#xD;
occasion some remark, perhaps; will t not&#xD;
be as well to attribute it to ill-health? In&#xD;
fact, it is but a tardy pursuance of the&#xD;
course advised by Dr. Martin after Char-&#xD;
icy's illness in the spring, and which his&#xD;
own disinclination alone prevented his fol-&#xD;
lowing at the time."&#xD;
"I shall be glad to do as you desire, Mr.&#xD;
Wales. I need not say that I am shocked&#xD;
by the event; but I trust we shall have him&#xD;
back again, bright and hearty, before many&#xD;
months." He watched closely for the ef.&#xD;
feet of these words, and experienced a&#xD;
secret delight in noting that the banker&#xD;
affected not to hear them, and turned again&#xD;
to his desk. "May I inquire his address,&#xD;
Mr. Wales?" he asked, rising.&#xD;
"Letters in Tompkins's care at Paris will&#xD;
reach him for the present."&#xD;
Huntley rgturaed his thanks, and went&#xD;
to his own office in a happy state of mind&#xD;
concealed under a troubled exterior. One&#xD;
important point which had caused him some&#xD;
lingering anxiety was settled, - his own&#xD;
connection with the affair at the gaming-&#xD;
house was unknown to Mr. Wales; and an&#xD;
important pr'obability was also certified,&#xD;
- there was no prospect of an early return&#xD;
of the exile.&#xD;
He made his appearance at the May-&#xD;
flower in the evening with a serious face,&#xD;
and to the questions with which he was be-&#xD;
sieged - for Charley's sudden voyage was&#xD;
already generally known - he replied,&#xD;
gravely and sadly, "Doctor's orders. I&#xD;
had not suspected it myself, but it seems he&#xD;
was ordered abroad in the spring, and would&#xD;
not go. I am awfully sorry, but I suppose&#xD;
it was the best thing to do."&#xD;
A general oxpr~ssion of regret and good&#xD;
wishes followed the intelligence, while Hunt-&#xD;
icy withdrew to a corner and read the brief&#xD;
and rather incoherent note of farewell&#xD;
which Chancy had left for him with Simms.&#xD;
That ever-smiling functionary, who had,&#xD;
however, toned down his face into some-&#xD;
thino' akin to sadness suited to the occasion,&#xD;
stood discreetly aloof while the broker pe-&#xD;
rused~the missive, after which he apologized&#xD;
for the liberty, but begged to state that Mr.&#xD;
Wales had left a fund in his hands to liqui-&#xD;
date his obligations to different gentlemen&#xD;

CHOISY.&#xD;
&#xD;
until that last moment, when he had reached&#xD;
a wild and almost chaotic state of mind,&#xD;
and was half unconscious of what he wrote.&#xD;
It was a confused, almost unmeaning, jumble&#xD;
of words, and might be cruel levity or the&#xD;
bitter outpourings of a despairing heart.&#xD;
"I suppose I am neither worse nor better&#xD;
than most men," he wrote; "I only know I&#xD;
am not very happy, and do not expect to be&#xD;
again. I know not where I shall go, or&#xD;
what I shall do; what will it matter? I&#xD;
shall adopt the true maxim of the outlaw,&#xD;
and waste no love on a loveless world."&#xD;
Twenty other equally reckless words,&#xD;
redeemed by a little burst of affection for&#xD;
herself at the end, and that was all; it&#xD;
confirmed her fears, and she had gone in an&#xD;
agony of terror and bewilderment to her&#xD;
uncle, and demanded to know the whole&#xD;
truth.&#xD;
With all the gentleness of which he was&#xD;
capable, Mr. Wales received her. lie&#xD;
forbore to reveal Chancy's disgrace to her,&#xD;
setting forth a rather plausibkf 'story about&#xD;
the necessity of change for the young man,&#xD;
dwelling lightly on his later and mistaken&#xD;
course, and more forcibly on the benefit&#xD;
of removal from damaging associations.&#xD;
Ii           The sweet, tearful face touched a hidden&#xD;
cord, perhaps; for he kissed her almost&#xD;
tenderly when she left him, and said in con-&#xD;
clusion, "It is all for the best, my dear, and&#xD;
you must not grieve for him. The change&#xD;
was an absolute necessity, and no doubt he&#xD;
will find great enjoyment in new scenes, as&#xD;
well as the benefits I hope for, and come hack&#xD;
- come back some day, I trust, sobered&#xD;
~nd improved."&#xD;
And he did trust so. If there had&#xD;
his wandering eye caught the steamer list&#xD;
been any momentary compunction following&#xD;
the resolve which he had so suddenly taken&#xD;
on the morning of Mr. Knarles's visit, when&#xD;
in the paper, it was rapidly appeased by his&#xD;
arguments, - arguments so&#xD;
reasonable in his own esteem&#xD;
soon canie to regard the scheme&#xD;
as a particularly happy conception~. He saw&#xD;
h his son on board the vessel, and bade him&#xD;
farewell solemnly, with much serious advice.&#xD;
If          He made liberal provision for him abroad,&#xD;
and left the limit of his absence to be fixed&#xD;
by himself beyond a term which he con-&#xD;
Ii          sidered it advisable to exact. He believed&#xD;
lie had acted with good judgment and with no&#xD;
little charity, and enjoyed intense seif-satis-&#xD;
4           fiction in consequence. Had he been con-&#xD;
scientious or even capable in an analysis of&#xD;
II         the feeling, he would have found it to be&#xD;
really more a sense of relief to himself than&#xD;
a sentiment of especial regard for his ~on.&#xD;
It might still be urged that the course&#xD;
was a wise one, - possibly, as a tardy rem-&#xD;
ed How~and&#xD;
for the ne elected ill.&#xD;
~mmna          accepted the fiat of her&#xD;
&#xD;
uncle in dumb consciousness of the futility&#xD;
of appeal. She fled from his presence, and,&#xD;
alone with her misery, sought to find&#xD;
consolation in hope; but it was a weary and&#xD;
pitiful effort. These later years had been a&#xD;
sad sequel to her happy childhood at the&#xD;
river-side home. The double loss of mother&#xD;
and brother had overwhelmed her with its&#xD;
crushing weight; and from this she had&#xD;
rallied, painfully 'clinging with desperation&#xD;
to the sole remnant of~ the dear old life now&#xD;
left to her, - the affection of her cousin. And&#xD;
this, in its kind, was unfailing. It was nut&#xD;
a sentiment of words, but an invisible element&#xD;
of their every-day life, and, though unex-&#xD;
pressed, no less a strong, enduring bond.&#xD;
They had grown up together in an unbroken&#xD;
home intimacy; there was not an event of&#xD;
her life with which he was not associated,&#xD;
and it had never entered her thoughts that&#xD;
their future lives could be separated. The&#xD;
child's affection had ripened with her years&#xD;
into something stronger and deeper, but&#xD;
the feeling had slept in the happy fullness of&#xD;
the present. If there had been moments&#xD;
when some secret voice spoke to the patient&#xD;
heart, moments which bred a nameless&#xD;
craving that stirred the hidden depths&#xD;
of her being, she had hushed the one and&#xD;
given the other no heed, living content in&#xD;
her daily food. So had she passed the age&#xD;
when most women in our tropic society are&#xD;
married and given in marriage without a wish&#xD;
or a thought of aught beyond their portions,&#xD;
and in that she was happy. Charley was never&#xD;
changed or careless, or less than he had ever&#xD;
been to her. Probably in all their lives he&#xD;
had never in word ordered so bruised her heart&#xD;
as he had done by those unhappy farewell&#xD;
gnes, and the cruel stroke awoke her fully&#xD;
to the true nature of her feelings. There&#xD;
was no resentment or any lesser emot ion in&#xD;
her soul, however; all, everything, was swal-&#xD;
lowed up in the single crushing thought of&#xD;
her loss. She had never dreamed of that&#xD;
possibility. Moments of trouble and little&#xD;
fleeting pangs of heart she had sometimes&#xD;
had, though to he jealous, as we use the&#xD;
word, was not in her nature; but these had&#xD;
faded as they came.&#xD;
She summoned her forces in vain to meet&#xD;
the blow; it was blank, bitter despair, with-&#xD;
out a ray qf light, and it crushed and con-&#xD;
quered her. She felt that she did nut know&#xD;
all, that there was still a mystery hidden&#xD;
beneath Charley's hurried lines and her&#xD;
uncle's guarded words, but she cared to&#xD;
know no more. What did it matter what&#xD;
he had done? What could lie do, her&#xD;
darling! that the world would not smile&#xD;
upon, and any hut that cold, hard father&#xD;
down stairs forgive with gladness? For&#xD;
an instant the spirit of her mother glowed&#xD;
in the wretched girl as the thought swept&#xD;
through her mind; then she drooped again,&#xD;

tures taken on the spot, you know, on the&#xD;

Emma laughed again at the irrepressible&#xD;
girl, and in some measure even shared her*&#xD;
elation; indeed, the knowledge of the ad-&#xD;
dress land sent a thrill to her heart. She&#xD;
had not yet been able to summon the cour-&#xD;
age to ask for, and Mr. Wales had neglected&#xD;
to offer, it; and she found a new strength&#xD;
growing in her heart as she listened to her&#xD;
enthusiastic friend.&#xD;
It was late in the evening, long after the&#xD;
girls' exuberant fancy had spent its ecstasy,&#xD;
as they sat with locked arms before the&#xD;
flickering fire, when Clare sprang up with&#xD;
an exclamation, and precipi a e sought&#xD;
the hat and jacket. "Gracious, goodness&#xD;
me! how I am staying! I have n't been a&#xD;
Job's comforter, at any rate, have I? Now&#xD;
you will go to bed and sleep, can't you,&#xD;
darling? If you don't, I shall not, you&#xD;
know." She was struggling wildly with the&#xD;
tiny seal-skin, but paused and took breath&#xD;
to add, "I will stay, dear, if you want me.&#xD;
You could send Stephen -"&#xD;
"No, it is n't necessary, you dear, good-&#xD;
hearted child; but you must put on these&#xD;
rubbers, and Stephen will see you across."&#xD;
"My poor~ pretty slippers I they are just&#xD;
ruined. There I you 'II never see your rub-&#xD;
bers again, I guess. Good night, you&#xD;
naughty, darling girl!"&#xD;
There was a rapturous exchange of em-&#xD;
braces, and Miss Clare turned to go. At&#xD;
the table she stopped to pick up Huntley's&#xD;
card, lying thereon.&#xD;
"0, he has been here, and you did n't&#xD;
see him! I wonder if-"&#xD;
What the young woman wondered is lost&#xD;
to history, as she failed to complete the sen-&#xD;
tence, and, bouncing off, rattled down stairs&#xD;
to where Stephen stood ready to escort her to&#xD;
her home across the way. He got a cheery&#xD;
"good night" for his pains; and as he came&#xD;
in again and closed up for the night he said&#xD;
to himself, "It 's a blessed thing for Miss&#xD;
Emmie to have a friend like Miss Clare to&#xD;
ehirk her up a bit these days."&#xD;
They were in truth old friends, these two&#xD;
girls so unlike and so equally lovely in&#xD;
their characters. The Jenningses were a&#xD;
family of the great upper world, and pos-&#xD;
sessed a splendid country property upon&#xD;
the river, which had immediately adjoined&#xD;
that of Mrs. Howland. Early acquaintance&#xD;
had led to friendship and much intim~tcy&#xD;
between the families during the long sum-&#xD;
mer holidays, and especially between Clare&#xD;
and Emma, who were nearly of the same&#xD;
age. The events of later years had served&#xD;
to make their relations even more intimate.&#xD;
Clare had wept her heart out at Fred How-&#xD;
land's death; she could never choose clearly&#xD;
between him and Charley, and had made&#xD;
&#xD;
desperate love to both ever since the era of&#xD;
short dresses; but when "Aunt Ellen," as&#xD;
she had always called Mrs. lowland, was&#xD;
taken, her grief was something like Emma's&#xD;
own, and had revealed to the latter an un-&#xD;
suspected depth of feeling.&#xD;
Mrs. Jennings made a protege' of the&#xD;
motherless girl from that time. She wa~&#xD;
very kind and sympathetic, and, indeed,&#xD;
loved Emma as a daughter; but she was,&#xD;
as I have said, a woman of the grand world,&#xD;
and believed implicitly in worldly curatives&#xD;
for worldly ills. She was a brilliant, clever&#xD;
woman, and a power in the circle in which&#xD;
she moved, but, what was admirable and&#xD;
perhaps rare, a power for good. The mass&#xD;
of women are moulded by society, while a&#xD;
few mould society to their will. Mrs. Jen-&#xD;
nings had found it possible to be a star in&#xD;
the social world and to fulfil her duties as&#xD;
wife and mother; to "queen it," in simple&#xD;
words, and remain a good woman; and few&#xD;
do as much.&#xD;
She carried Emma away to the sea-shore&#xD;
that sad summer, and was very tender and&#xD;
careful with the bruised heart, while she&#xD;
drcw the line sharply where a natural sor-&#xD;
row becomes a consuming melancholy, and&#xD;
fought the weakness of Emma's too plastic&#xD;
nature bending to earth under its weight of&#xD;
tr~mble. In time, by argument and en-&#xD;
treaty, she won her victory, and ushercd&#xD;
Emma into her own golden realm, and the&#xD;
appreciative girl found there much consola-&#xD;
tion and some happiness.&#xD;
Emma rallied bravely on the new hope&#xD;
awakened by Chire's giddy but thoroughly&#xD;
good and loving fancies, and, after the child&#xD;
had gone, busied herself in her room with&#xD;
more spirit than she had known for days,&#xD;
piled coals on her fire, and, drawing her&#xD;
writing-table near it, sat down and wrote&#xD;
far into the night, wrote a letter of warm,&#xD;
unquestioning affection to her truant boy.&#xD;
After that she slept a deep, restful sleep; but&#xD;
she was down betimes in the morning, look-&#xD;
ing quite like herself, and gave the letter to&#xD;
Stephen to mail with a smile that gladdened&#xD;
the old man's heart. "Mail it at once,&#xD;
please, and find out when it will go," she&#xD;
said; and the servant, having caught the&#xD;
superscription, shuffled off nimbly enough&#xD;
to do her bidding. He did it faithfully too,&#xD;
and it was with silent amusement that&#xD;
Emma received the impetuous Clare at a&#xD;
later hour, and proceeded with her to the&#xD;
joint construction of that wonderful letter&#xD;
of reprimand, instructions, and commissions,&#xD;
smoothed down "at the end" with a great&#xD;
deal of love and good wishes; her own was,&#xD;
meantime, being hurried aboard the steamer,&#xD;
and would be miles on its way before the&#xD;
sun went down. But the occupation was a&#xD;
pleasant one, and made the day a happy&#xD;
contrast for Emma to those of the preced-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing week. Clare was ecstatic; her idea&#xD;
poured out in a flood upon her paper, whic]&#xD;
was written and crossed, and rewrite:&#xD;
diagonally, while Emma barely finished he&#xD;
sheet in single lines between her fits o&#xD;
laughter at the irresistible and not un&#xD;
frequently preposterous inspirations of he:&#xD;
friend. Then it was insisted that Emmn~&#xD;
should rea(I her missive aloud, after which&#xD;
and not without some difficulty, Clare rent&#xD;
her own, - a happy circumstance, since ~i&#xD;
led to a salutary system of corrections auc&#xD;
the supplying ot~ innumerable omissions, ir&#xD;
the absence of which the epistle would hav&#xD;
puzzled a more adroit hand at manuscript&#xD;
than Charley XVales. The affair was finally)&#xD;
achieved with great e'claf, and Clare was iii&#xD;
a fever of childish delight when the neal&#xD;
packet was duly scaled and addressed in&#xD;
Emma's clear hand ready for the post&#xD;
She made a little face at the thought of the&#xD;
"awfully" long time it would require to&#xD;
bring response, wondered that Emma should&#xD;
remember the address, which she had quite&#xD;
forgot ten, and went home congratulating&#xD;
herself with un~elflsh happiness on having&#xD;
brought back the smiles to the poor, dear&#xD;
thing's pale face. And she had done well,&#xD;
the big-hearted girl, better even than she&#xD;
dreamed.&#xD;
When Mr. Huntley called some evenings&#xD;
later, he found Miss Howland "at home,"&#xD;
and was met by her with a face and manner&#xD;
that filled hint with uneasy surprise. He&#xD;
found no external evidence of the shock&#xD;
and grief he believed she had sustained; she&#xD;
spoke with regret of her cousin's absence,&#xD;
but did not dwell on it, and the fine edifice&#xD;
of delicate sympathy he had reared for the&#xD;
occasion fell ~o the ground and left the&#xD;
clever wording at an actual loss for words.&#xD;
He made a brief call, and emerged into the&#xD;
street oppresse(I with a sense of discomfiture.&#xD;
I am sorry to add that he came afterwards&#xD;
to the club and astonished Simums by making&#xD;
a rude demand for "the money Wales owed&#xD;
him," and surprised us all by a display of&#xD;
temper over our really unexceptionable whis-&#xD;
key and the club attendance. We won-&#xD;
dered at the unusu~d exhibition on the part&#xD;
of the impassive man, and Tommy West&#xD;
gave utterance to the opinion that he was&#xD;
the "wrong way all up his back," as the&#xD;
door closed on him.&#xD;
He took his way later to the abode and&#xD;
place of business of Mr. Worthington, where,&#xD;
in fact, he had been a rather frequent&#xD;
visitor since the Occasion which introduced&#xD;
him to the reader. That he was not in an&#xD;
agreeable state of mind as he moved up the&#xD;
street might have been inferred from the&#xD;
rapid and nervous manner of his walk and&#xD;
the savage whirl of his cane; a stray dog&#xD;
sneaking inoffensively along the house-wall&#xD;
came in for a blow from that weapon, and&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
an equally stray policeman Ofi the corner,&#xD;
Ia who favored the gentleman with a curious&#xD;
a glance, little dreamed of the latter's very&#xD;
r strong inclination to serve him in the same&#xD;
f way. He did not enter the parlors at&#xD;
- Worthington's, or go to the dining-hall; ~but&#xD;
r left a message for the master with an at-&#xD;
a tenant, and proceeded up stairs to a private&#xD;
sitting-room with the readiness of one famil-&#xD;
I mr with the way. here he ordered a hot&#xD;
punch, lighted a cigar, and, throwing himself&#xD;
I into an easy-chair before the fire, brooded&#xD;
gloomily.&#xD;
it was some time before Worthington&#xD;
entered the room, which he did at last with&#xD;
a feeble attempt at his usual gracious smile;&#xD;
evidently lac was not enchanted witla the&#xD;
visit.&#xD;
"Ah! you, is it, Dick, making yourself&#xD;
comfortable as usual? Quite right, old fel-&#xD;
low; always do it when you can, you know,"&#xD;
he said, carelessly, coming to the fire and&#xD;
planting himself before it with a glance&#xD;
down at Huntley.&#xD;
Thac broker neither moved nor responded,&#xD;
but brooded still with his head on his breast&#xD;
and his eyes on the coals. Worthington&#xD;
watched him an instant longer, and then,&#xD;
shrugging his shoulders, gathered a coat-tail&#xD;
over each arm5 spread himself kurionsly&#xD;
before the fire, and awaited eVents.&#xD;
Hundey spoke finally in a desperate,&#xD;
tleci~ive way: "I must have more money,&#xD;
Sam."&#xD;
The gambler frowned heavily,~but did not&#xD;
turn. He took a cigar out of lais mouth&#xD;
delicately, and, biting the end off with his&#xD;
sharp, white teeth, blew it into space; this&#xD;
pantomime concluded, he smoked silently.&#xD;
Huntley broke out again: "That infernal&#xD;
slaort venture in Old Southern is getting me&#xD;
in a ('orner. Somebody must have crammed&#xD;
Jenkins, or else he lied deliberately about&#xD;
the stock, for it has crawled up steadily&#xD;
ever since I sold it, and from what I hear&#xD;
to-day it is liI~ely to be bulled five or even&#xD;
ten per cent higher. I can't cover; it&#xD;
would ruin me unless I could go long of the&#xD;
stock to balance, and I have n't the money&#xD;
to (10 it."&#xD;
There was no response yet from tlae man&#xD;
before the fire. Huntley looke(I up and&#xD;
continued "It is a pretty sure thing, this&#xD;
rise; the Druid clique are in it, I know, and&#xD;
if 1 had the means I would take one or two&#xD;
thousand shares to-morrow. A check for&#xD;
thirty or forty thousand would do it, as money&#xD;
loans free on the stock, - another good&#xD;
sign. Why not make a joint operation?"&#xD;
"I cama't (10 it, Huntley," answcm'ed the&#xD;
other, at last, with marked impatience; "I&#xD;
am in down there now a deuced sight deeper&#xD;
than I wish I was, and I have to thank you&#xD;
for the most of it. I have n't a spare dollar&#xD;
outside of my need now, and what I kt you&#xD;

BENT TO THE TASK.&#xD;
&#xD;
have last week has really inconvenienced&#xD;
me."&#xD;
Iluntley looked up angrily. "By -!&#xD;
*          Worthington, it 's too bad to try to put that&#xD;
off on me. I '11 take your gains any full&#xD;
night down stairs and chance it to get out&#xD;
*          of my scrape on them!&#xD;
"My 'gains (Iowa stairs*' are none of your&#xD;
affiuii s, I)tck," responded Worthington, dtyly.&#xD;
Huntley looked at him in mingled surprise&#xD;
and rage; but the fine face of the gambler&#xD;
was unruffled.&#xD;
"Now see here!" cried the broker, pas-&#xD;
sionately, "I won't stand that! I put an easy&#xD;
ten thousand in your hands a week ago -"&#xD;
" And have taken it nearly all out again&#xD;
since. I will give you the rest to be quits,&#xD;
if you will stow that business forever; it&#xD;
was dirty, and I don't like it!"&#xD;
Huntley waS silenced for some moments&#xD;
by these words, but recovered his sangfroid&#xD;
rapidly.&#xD;
"This won't do, Sam," he resumed quietly;&#xD;
"we can't afford to quarrel, and we ought&#xD;
to know how to give and take by this time,&#xD;
fdlow-countryinen in a strange land as we&#xD;
are, - n'est ce&#xD;
There was an imperceptible twitch in&#xD;
Worthington's face at the last words, and he&#xD;
*          did not meet the eye of the other, who looked&#xD;
at him with soniething of an ironical smile.&#xD;
" You will never lose anything by mc,&#xD;
Sam; don't let that worry you. And as for&#xD;
your having any conscience about that&#xD;
matter of young ~Vales, it 's simply absurd.&#xD;
Why! it was the biggest piece of double luck&#xD;
imaginable; you got your money, and 1 got&#xD;
the young brute out of amy way!"&#xD;
"Is it a fact, then, that you are going to&#xD;
try the game in that quarter?"&#xD;
Huntley's heart revolted despite himself&#xD;
at the quick question; but lie showed no&#xD;
sign, and met Worthington's eye steadily as&#xD;
he answered, "And why not?"&#xD;
"XVhy not, to be sure; only, I should&#xD;
think-"&#xD;
" Well, what should you think ?"&#xD;
The words were almost fiercely put, and&#xD;
the gambler laughed with well-assumed&#xD;
gaycty.&#xD;
"By Jove! I don't know what to think&#xD;
sometmmcs~ Dick; it 's a ruin world to live&#xD;
in! But I must go down. I am really not&#xD;
in funds, but I can let you have some&#xD;
securities."&#xD;
"What are they?"&#xD;
"The old lot, five-twenties."&#xD;
Huntley made a grimace. "0, the regis-&#xD;
I&#xD;
tered ones?"&#xD;
"Yes, the same," laughed Worthington.&#xD;
"Look out where you burrow on them.&#xD;
I would n't recommend old Wales; he&#xD;
can't be very fond of my name on paper!&#xD;
I '11 send them down in the morning, - ta,&#xD;
ta!" And he went out.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jiuntley remained some time in his luxu-&#xD;
rious solitude, silent and tl~ioughtfuI.&#xD;
"I wonder what mad~ the man show&#xD;
ugly," he said to himself. "He ought to&#xD;
know better, and, by-, he shall be aught,&#xD;
if he tries it a~nia!" He aroused himself&#xD;
at this juncture, looked at his watch, and,&#xD;
whistling at its disclosure, betoek himself&#xD;
homeward.&#xD;
The bonds came down promptly in the&#xD;
morning, and the amount raised on them&#xD;
enabled iluntley not only to weather the&#xD;
shoals, but to follow as well his scheme ol&#xD;
hedgingo' whereby he came our of tl~e&#xD;
affair with a handsome balance. It was&#xD;
with n6 little satisfaction that lie returijed&#xD;
the securities to their owner a week later,&#xD;
with his compliments and regrets. " What&#xD;
a pity you would not come in on the Old&#xD;
Southern!" he wrote; "a clear use of five&#xD;
per cent in two days." On reading which&#xD;
Mr. Worthington shrugged his shoulders,&#xD;
as was his wont, and remarked that "the&#xD;
fellow always fell on his feet."&#xD;
The broker was therefore in a genial hu-&#xD;
mor when, some evenings after his visit at&#xD;
the Wales mansion, he called across the&#xD;
way on his charming acquaintance, Miss&#xD;
Clare Jennings. That young lady was in&#xD;
quite a flutter over her visitor, for the&#xD;
handsome Englishman had an ardent ad-&#xD;
mirer in Miss Clare, and she had on divers&#xD;
occasions deployed all her forces against&#xD;
him with an exasperating uncertainty of&#xD;
success. She received him, accordingly,&#xD;
with much grace, but seoldeti him coquet-&#xD;
tishly for his neglect in calling. Iluntley&#xD;
thought what a splendid creature she was,&#xD;
looking at her as she sat before him toying&#xD;
with a shadowy bit of handkeu chief, and&#xD;
casting arch glances at him. How much&#xD;
easier to be had than that other one! A&#xD;
card t&amp;amp; play, perhaps, if the other failed.&#xD;
"I owe you infinite apology, Miss Jen-&#xD;
nings; it is we who suffer, however, com-&#xD;
pelled as we are to deny ourselves the&#xD;
pleasure of your society. You know how&#xD;
it is-"&#xD;
"0 yes, I know; please don't vex my&#xD;
ears with the thrice-told tale. 'Business,'&#xD;
of course, always 'business'!"&#xD;
Quite right; stupid, is n't it, that no&#xD;
one invents a new plea? I have tried. It&#xD;
has cost me nights of sleepless study, it has&#xD;
indeed, Miss Jennings, in the vain hope of&#xD;
winning the gratitude of my f~'llow-sinners."&#xD;
"And of course you did not succeed. I&#xD;
shall suspect you, however, hereafter. It is&#xD;
horrid, though, that you men ~annot con-&#xD;
tent yourselves with all day in Wall Street,&#xD;
but must have a 'Board, or whatever you&#xD;
call it, at the hotels in the evening. I&#xD;
would turn you all out in the street, if I&#xD;
were the Fifth Avenue Hotel !"&#xD;
Huntley laughed gayly at the idea. "So&#xD;
&#xD;
you would, and be a benefactress to us all&#xD;
You see, if some go, all must follow; ani&#xD;
so we of the mass are dragged in by th(&#xD;
incorrigibles."&#xD;
"Yes, I see; you all distrust each other&#xD;
and fear to lose an advantage by being ab&#xD;
sent. You poor souls!"&#xD;
The reasoning of Miss Clare was irresisti&#xD;
ble. Huntley laughed and surrendered.&#xD;
"1 cry you mercy, Miss Jennings, as one&#xD;
of the convicted. Behold me at your feet,&#xD;
And the gay world? Following its course,&#xD;
I presume, as merrily as marriage-bells. I&#xD;
have bv'en such a recluse for a month past,&#xD;
that I feel like a monument of antiquity."&#xD;
"0, the same old tliinol" said the young&#xD;
woman, with a pensive sigh. "I ani quite&#xD;
worn out with it, I assure you, and every&#xD;
fresh card of invitation gives me a shudder.&#xD;
it is n't satisfying, Mr. Hunt'ey."&#xD;
She had seen two winters in society,&#xD;
poor thing! Mr. Huntley looked comically&#xD;
grave. "No more it is, Miss Jennings," -&#xD;
he was not quite sure of her meaning, but&#xD;
he was immensely sympathetic,-" no more&#xD;
it is; the more we see of it, the less satis-&#xD;
faction it affords us. It is almost sad some-&#xD;
tinies. is it not? 'If this be all, and naught&#xD;
beyond!' Ah, well! we must go on with&#xD;
the world, of course; but as for me, I have&#xD;
no heart to go about since our Charley ran&#xD;
away so unceremoniously."&#xD;
Was a't it a shame? I was so surprised&#xD;
 and grieved! And to think lie was ill all&#xD;
that time and no one knew it. Of course,&#xD;
he would n't speak of it."&#xD;
"I had no suspicion of it; indeed, I can&#xD;
scarcely believe it now; but doctors know&#xD;
best, and must be obeyed. He must be&#xD;
sadly2 missed over the way."&#xD;
"You can't think how much. That poor,&#xD;
dear Em! She was inconsolable, and just&#xD;
as miserable as she could be."&#xD;
"I can well imagine it." He spoke with&#xD;
sweet sadness, and Miss Clare darted a&#xD;
soft glance at him.&#xD;
"Ah, Mr. Huntley, it was beautiful, that&#xD;
attachment!"&#xD;
The gentleman moved nervously, but&#xD;
oaked volumes of sympathy.&#xD;
"The poor thing was so wretched," con-&#xD;
tinned Clare, "that I was heartbroken about&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"But I found her quite cheerful, and&#xD;
~. evidently much consoled, when I called on&#xD;
4~ Wednesday," said Hantley, with an expec-&#xD;
tant heart. "So much so, that I confess I&#xD;
was surprised."&#xD;
Clare looked at him triumphantly. "That&#xD;
was ate, Mr. Huntley. I did that."&#xD;
"1 can understand what measureless com-&#xD;
~ fort she would gather from your sweet sym-&#xD;
- pathy, Miss Jennings."&#xD;
~    "Ah, yes; but you don't know how I&#xD;
revived her spirits, and by such a simple&#xD;
&#xD;
thing. I can't conceive what made Char.&#xD;
I ley act so strangely about o'oing; why, do&#xD;
you know, he never saw cEmn before lie&#xD;
went, or even let her know where he , was&#xD;
going !&#xD;
She wrinkled her pretty brow a motnent&#xD;
over the problem, and iluntley said, "No&#xD;
- doubt the poor boy was awfully cut up. I&#xD;
inferred as much from his farewell note to&#xD;
me. I was unluckily out of town when lie&#xD;
* left."&#xD;
"How astonished you must have been!"&#xD;
" I was, indeed. - more than astonished.&#xD;
iBut you have not told me by what magical&#xD;
process you consoled Miss Howland."&#xD;
* "0, just the simplest thing! She did n't&#xD;
even know Charley's address, and had not&#xD;
the courage to ask Mr. Wales for it, and&#xD;
she was breaking her heart about it. So I&#xD;
just marched into his sanctum, and de-&#xD;
manded it on the spot."&#xD;
And got it, of course," cried her listener,&#xD;
with well-assumed admiration. He was&#xD;
gnawing his lip the while, and cursing this&#xD;
new chance. "Who could refuse you, if&#xD;
you(cam9 thus?"&#xD;
course I got it; and we wrote such&#xD;
a nice long letter to the dear fellow Em&#xD;
became positively happy over it, and has&#xD;
been so ever since; though I suppose it&#xD;
will hr an age before an answer can come."&#xD;
"It is vexatious, is n't it?&#xD;
It was vexatious, very vexatious, to him;&#xD;
and after the t&amp;amp;e-~e-t&amp;amp;e had dragged through&#xD;
another half-hour, in which he lost much&#xD;
ground in the good graces of Miss Chare by&#xD;
his excessive dulness, he took his depart-&#xD;
ure in great annoyance, and was even less&#xD;
amiable at the club afterwards than he had&#xD;
been on a previous evening. But the man&#xD;
had ere this fully measured and accepted&#xD;
his task. He made a secret no longer, to&#xD;
the nightly guest in the mirror, of the pas-&#xD;
sion that was growing in his heart, roused&#xD;
by the opposition of circumstance and&#xD;
nourished now by ever-present dreams. He&#xD;
gave himself over to it, heart and soul, and&#xD;
shaped his course to the fierce resolution of&#xD;
winning by fair means or foul. Plots and&#xD;
counterplots circled in his brain, keeping&#xD;
hini for days in a mad whirl of passionate&#xD;
thoughts, and almost unfitting hini for his&#xD;
business. To these there succeeded the&#xD;
clear outlines of well-defined schemes rioid&#xD;
lines of conduct to be followed, and ~'he&#xD;
moves of the game to be stu(lied and sure.&#xD;
The creature who had been a wild and&#xD;
reckless adventurer for the better half of&#xD;
his life, governed by the caprice of the&#xD;
hour, tossed by his passions, and led by&#xD;
chance, became, with this last touch of na-&#xD;
ture, the master of himself, the instrument&#xD;
of a sentiment stronger than himself. Would&#xD;
he win the game, this clever, undaunted&#xD;
player, schooled of the world, - this bold,&#xD;

&#xD;
strong, far-sighted, silent genius of self,&#xD;
without conscience, without principle, and&#xD;
without fear?&#xD;
A hundred to one against the field I&#xD;
Weeks and months went by, and men&#xD;
saw a marked change in the broker. In&#xD;
the street they called it imprQvemeflt and&#xD;
an improvement was certainly visible in&#xD;
his affairs there, as his bankers could tes-&#xD;
tify. At the club it was said, inelegantly,&#xD;
that the man was "soured"; but as he&#xD;
came more and more rarely and stayed&#xD;
briefly, it was a short-lived topic. Proba-&#xD;
bly the elegant Worthington was more per-&#xD;
plexed by the change than any other ob-&#xD;
server; it began by interesting, and ended&#xD;
by alarming him.&#xD;
"1 can't think what is on with the man,"&#xD;
said that worthy to himself, ~ifter a settle-&#xD;
ment of accounts in which H~ntley cleared&#xD;
off his entire obligation to the gambler;&#xD;
"evidently training for something, and&#xD;
wants to shake his old friends." And the&#xD;
gentleman, whose soliloquies were largely&#xD;
tinctured with sporting terms, looked trou-&#xD;
bled. He went so far as to send certain&#xD;
speculative orders to be executed by hunt-&#xD;
ley &amp;amp; Co.; and though the broker smiled&#xD;
wickedly at the messenger, he did not re-&#xD;
fuse to accept his new customer.&#xD;
"Nervous, is Sammy 1" said he to him-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
"Glad he took 'em," thought Worthing-&#xD;
ton.&#xD;
Huntley called regularly, hut not with&#xD;
marked frequency, at the house on the ave-&#xD;
nue, lie displayed rather less of his for-&#xD;
mer volatile brilliance in conversation, and&#xD;
Miss Ciare, who happened in occasionally&#xD;
during his calls, thought he was becoming&#xD;
decidedly stupid and blas6; but Emma&#xD;
found his quiet and wonderfully sympathetic&#xD;
manner very agreeable. He moved cau-&#xD;
tiously and by inches, but he worked well,&#xD;
and made progress; for, from being kind to&#xD;
him for her cousin's sake, who had asked it&#xD;
in his last lines to her, Emma came in time&#xD;
to take a growing pleasure in the broker's&#xD;
society for itself; and in tie studied atti-&#xD;
tudehe assumed toward her there was a&#xD;
rare attraction she could not but leel, that&#xD;
no woman could fail to feel, who sees before&#xD;
her a man of superior years, of a rich and&#xD;
checkered experience, and an extensive&#xD;
knowledge of the world that speaks in&#xD;
trifles but is constantly discerned, - a man&#xD;
we call "accomplished" and believe to he&#xD;
wise; whom we admire and wonder at, and&#xD;
who flatters us insensibly but deeply by&#xD;
a subtle, studied deference. Desdemona&#xD;
would always love her heroic wonder, Mi-&#xD;
randa her beautiful stranger from the un-&#xD;
known world; and though the heart of Em-&#xD;
ma Howland was guarded with a love too&#xD;
strong to be overcome, she was not proof&#xD;
&#xD;
against the strong though unsuspected in-&#xD;
fluence of this skilled reader of hearts. in&#xD;
her he had no common character to deal&#xD;
with. lie had learned that quickly, and,&#xD;
fortified in the knowledge, his advance s&#xD;
were made with all the skill and caution of&#xD;
a master tactician.&#xD;
Meantime letters had come in tedious&#xD;
course from Chancy. He had received&#xD;
that written by Emma and the famous joint&#xD;
production we have described, which were&#xD;
forwarded to him in London from Paris.&#xD;
He wrote briefly but cheerfully. He was&#xD;
well, and gathering rare enjoyment in his&#xD;
new atmosphere. When he should be set-&#xD;
tled at Paris, the orders of the ladies would&#xD;
be attended to, but he had found London&#xD;
so attractive that he could set no time for&#xD;
his departure. He wrote a half-tender&#xD;
apology to Emma for the manner of his&#xD;
leaving: lie was so miserable that he was&#xD;
scarcely conscious at that time what he did;&#xD;
"would she forgive him, and believe him&#xD;
always her loving and affectionate Char-&#xD;
ley?" And Emma kissed the sheet, and&#xD;
slept with it under her pillov. She wrote&#xD;
him again, tenderly and tearfully, and&#xD;
waited long for a reply.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
ASHORE ON ~EA~A.&#xD;
THE June roses were blooming in the&#xD;
parterres of the imperial Terrace when&#xD;
Charley Wales arrived at last at Paris. lie&#xD;
had lingered long in London, making some&#xD;
pleasant acquaintance, and held by the&#xD;
magic attraction of the grim monster moth-&#xD;
er of cities, which, for his untravelled fancy,&#xD;
possessed a fascinating and romantic charm.&#xD;
His intermediate bit of sea life prepared&#xD;
him admirably for the enjoyment of new&#xD;
scenes, - those twelve wild and exciting&#xD;
days on the winter Atlantic, with just&#xD;
enough congenial society l~elow dccl s to dis-&#xD;
sipate the gloomy thoughts that might have&#xD;
come in with the star'iess nights and the&#xD;
grand old waste that warred with the winds&#xD;
incessantly before his eyes. It was a pe-&#xD;
riod of regeneration for the young man,&#xD;
smoothing down the angry and troubled&#xD;
feelings which had marked the first hours&#xD;
of his expatriation, and leaving him with a&#xD;
sober consciousness of. his position; some-&#xD;
what saddened at times by the error that&#xD;
had marred his life, but more and more re-&#xD;
solved to turn the lesson to good account,&#xD;
to reap some pleasure from his present, and&#xD;
qualify himself for a better future. There&#xD;
was a sort of mental arrest in. this abrupt&#xD;
change from his free and careless existence&#xD;
ashore, with the warm relief of a luxurious&#xD;
home and countless friends, to the solemn&#xD;

Chancy was fortunate to have lingered and&#xD;
enjoyed the parent city before he turned to&#xD;
its glittering neighbor across the strait.&#xD;
You will db ~vell, reader mine, to follow his&#xD;
eXamnl)le.&#xD;
And so in the early days of June Chancy&#xD;
found himself in Paris. It was the Paris of&#xD;
the Second Empire, of Baron Haussmann&#xD;
and Louis Napoleon; the peerless, laughing,&#xD;
sinning, glorious Pails of the nineteenth&#xD;
century, in its sixth decadee. Even then&#xD;
the Saii(IS were running fast in her hour of&#xD;
triumph, ann through all the wild revel and&#xD;
tumult of lien giddy life there fell at intervals&#xD;
a shadow of the future and a cry from some&#xD;
solitary, watchful soul. But she heard or&#xD;
heeded not; it was a feast where the lights&#xD;
shone so l)nightly, and hearts heat so ~ias-&#xD;
smonately, that the words upon the wall were&#xD;
idle and unnoticed things. Who shall write&#xD;
the story of those (lays? who paint the&#xD;
scene where wealth was melted into impossi-&#xD;
bk sImlemlor, and luxury carried to nameless&#xD;
vice; where the man of the Faubourg vied&#xD;
with the prodigality of the Emperor; where&#xD;
woman, like the genius of fhte, ruled and&#xD;
ruine(l, and where she might stand to-day&#xD;
in the tatters of her scarlet robe and cry&#xD;
with l)elilah, " Behold my work&#xD;
Ilium/hit! and we weary of the unchanged&#xD;
story of her succeeding tistenhood ; let the&#xD;
man who kne~v Paris in her golden days&#xD;
fold the rare memory in his heart, and sing&#xD;
of it like Homcr when he is blind with age.&#xD;
There i~ an inevitable first4heling of&#xD;
isolation in a new land where one hears no&#xD;
longer his own tongue, and finds himself&#xD;
surrounnlcil by the unwanted physiognoumics&#xD;
of another rae ; it makes some acquaintance&#xD;
a covete(l boon, and it led Charley without&#xD;
delay to l)m'eselit his credentials to Monsieur&#xD;
Somers at the latter's apartments in the&#xD;
Rue Pasquier. Mr. Somers received him&#xD;
with something like a huzza. lie was a&#xD;
large, almost too large, but very handsome&#xD;
man ; an undoubted Engli4mman, with the&#xD;
skin and color of a woman, straight, full&#xD;
nose, an(l laughing light blue eyes, with&#xD;
heavy whiskers of the very lightest brown,&#xD;
and a sweeping moustache that effectually&#xD;
hid his mouth. A man of undefinable age,&#xD;
he might be thirty-five and possibly ten&#xD;
years older; puzzling, but attractive at first&#xD;
glance. Treasuring the most cordial feeling&#xD;
for Iluntley, Chanley accepted the blond&#xD;
giant at sight with a certain enthusiasm.&#xD;
Had he known Iluntley better, he might&#xD;
have formed another estimate of Iluntley's&#xD;
" 01(1 friend."&#xD;

of one o'clock was just taking his coffee in&#xD;

his handsomely furnished parlor, and met&#xD;
our hero with a laughing apology for his&#xD;

robes.&#xD;
"My dear Mr. Wales! I am delighted.&#xD;
Eajia! Why, I am wasted whh hope de-&#xD;
fi rved! Voyoas; it must be a year since&#xD;
Huntley wrote inc of your coming!"&#xD;
Scarcely," said Charley, laughing at the&#xD;
irresistible bonhomie of the other, " nbt&#xD;

sailed in December."&#xD;
"AIm, yes, so you did. I remember now&#xD;

"Well, to return to 'Mr. Thompson.'&#xD;

regulates his movements by the Guide.&#xD;
He breakfasts, like a barbarian, when Paris&#xD;

so&amp;amp;ety and proceeded to indulge in the&#xD;
exotic practice of whiskey cocktails at mid-&#xD;
day. To arrive at this he posts recrularly&#xD;
to the Grand Hotel each day, where Tie will&#xD;
not fail to find a morning coterie of his&#xD;
compatriots, with continual additions; this&#xD;
leads to new acquaintances, and the cele-&#xD;
bration of the same, after your genial cus-&#xD;
tom, by the consumption of fiery compounds&#xD;
unknown to Europeans. It has often seemed&#xD;
to me that Mr. Thompson's recollections of&#xD;
Paris will relate mainly to those wlhom he&#xD;
met there; for he keeps this thing up fre-&#xD;
quently all day, rotating from the Grand&#xD;
Hotel to Thorpe's in an endless succession&#xD;
of new acquaintances and cocktails. To&#xD;
dine, he goes with a party of confr~res to&#xD;
the most celebrated establishment on his&#xD;
list as yet unvisited. Of these places he&#xD;
makes it a point to try a new one every&#xD;
day, which prevents his becoming known&#xD;
and properly served; so he ends by being&#xD;
dissatisfied with all of them. Then he&#xD;
goes to Mabille, Musard, Closerie, or one&#xD;
of a hundred places, and gets home at any&#xD;
hour, with a plundered purse, and a green&#xD;
sickness from a hideous mixture of spirits&#xD;
and wine. A month of this wears him out.&#xD;
He believes he has 'done Paris,' thinks it&#xD;
rather slow, and leaves it with a disagree-&#xD;
able consciousness that it has been rather&#xD;
expensive and not very satisfactory.&#xD;
":Now, I am not disposed to quarrel with&#xD;
your national habits, Mr * Wales, and what&#xD;
.1 have said about the whiskey-drinking is&#xD;
simply to illustrate. The mistake these&#xD;
gentlemen make is the natural one of cling-&#xD;
ing to home ideas and endeavoring to im-&#xD;
port them to a foreign soil, and, by turning&#xD;
some corner of Paris into New York, to live&#xD;
in a sort of transplanted atmosphere of&#xD;
their own. What should you think of a&#xD;

cook of those days made well, had given&#xD;
place 'to American Fish-Balls' and 'Buck-&#xD;
wheat Cakes,' which, though not a judge, I&#xD;
will venture to bet he makes execrably. It&#xD;
is positively melancholy, Mr. Wales; the&#xD;
very cuisine, the blossom of French civiliza-&#xD;
tion, has been prostituted to your irregular&#xD;
tastes; and if I want a choice p/at, such as&#xD;
we could get in fifty places in old times, I&#xD;
am at a loss now where to go for it."&#xD;
He paused with a sigh of regret, and&#xD;
blew a meditative column of smoke at the&#xD;
opposite wall.&#xD;
"Pardon my scold," he said, resuming.&#xD;
"It 's about tIme only hobby I mount, this&#xD;
growing anarchy in the kitchen which is&#xD;
spoiling all our dinners. All I have said,&#xD;
as you may imagine, is simply in preface to&#xD;
the question, whether, being of the school&#xD;
Thompson, you expected to fellow the&#xD;
Thompronian method. 1 may as well tell&#xD;
you, frankly, that his ways are not mine, nor&#xD;
do I think you would find any profit or sat-&#xD;

Charley was rather puzzled. "To tell&#xD;
you the truth, Mr. Somers, I had not calcu-&#xD;
lated on putting myself under -that is,&#xD;
making myself a burden on your hands -"&#xD;
"Thcre it is again I YGu (haps from&#xD;

ber abstractions are French. Let us com-&#xD;
promise, Mr. Wales. Give me a month to&#xD;
develop my scheme, and then, if it isn't&#xD;
agreeable, we will dissolve."&#xD;
Charley did not clearly understand what&#xD;
he was subscribing to, but the genial Bo-&#xD;
hemian was quite irresistible.&#xD;
"I put myself entirely in your bands, Mr.&#xD;
Somers; but I must also confess that I&#xD;
should enjoy meeting my fellow-Americans,&#xD;
even," he added, laughing, "'Mr. Thomp-&#xD;
son,' for want of a better."&#xD;
"Of course, of course; and I did n't mean&#xD;
to convey the idea that 'TLompson' is a&#xD;

will not agree to join him in his peculiar&#xD;

"Not very good, I fear," replied Charley.&#xD;

had dived into his dressing-room, and was&#xD;
rapidly completing a street toilet. "We 'II&#xD;

lie came out directly, with hat and cane,&#xD;
and fitted on the first before the glass; after&#xD;
which he turned to Charley with the pecu-&#xD;

been greater, he was too new to the sweet&#xD;
sin of table-worship to form an intelligent&#xD;
estimate of the rare excellence of the repast.&#xD;
lie knew only that the food was ambrosial,&#xD;
and the wine a warm, rich blood, and under&#xD;
the influence of both he grew rather ecstatic.&#xD;
A dim conviction forced itself into his fancy&#xD;
that he had lived a barbarian up to that&#xD;
hour, and that he had entered another&#xD;
atmosphere, where life was divested of dross&#xD;
and scientifically reduced to the pure gold&#xD;
of pleasure. He sealed the impression with&#xD;
his last glass of purple Bordeaux, and went&#xD;
down with his companions to the coffee-room,&#xD;
where Madame Foyot herself, the ample,&#xD;
smiling dame, whose kindly face is photo.&#xD;
graphed in the memories of more men than 1&#xD;
would venture to number, sat in her chair&#xD;
of state and ruled, a benignant genius of&#xD;
mocha anil the weed. The pretty, busy salon,&#xD;
with its throng of evening guests, the Orient&#xD;
odor of coffee, and clouds of smoke1 the&#xD;
groups of absorbed chess-players, and noisy&#xD;
tables of e'cartd and pi(luCt, the ever-merry&#xD;
tumult of conversation, and the conspicuous&#xD;
wit of more than one repeated jest, the fun and&#xD;
good-nature and thoroughly mutual enjoy-&#xD;
ment that revilede, all served to strengthen&#xD;
our hero's enthusiastic repossession in favor&#xD;
of Parisian lifh. The spell of this life was&#xD;
in full possession of his senses; London, if&#xD;
he paused t? recall it, would have seemed a&#xD;
far, nusty vision of the past; and when he&#xD;
rode home with Somers, after biddingYasour&#xD;
good night at his door, it was in a delicious,&#xD;
dreamy state of mind which rendered him&#xD;
rather absent and incoherent in his replies&#xD;
to the questions of his worthy companion.&#xD;
"I asked Vasour to make a third in our&#xD;
landau to-morrow at the races," said Somers;&#xD;
"but he pleaded an engagement. Clever,&#xD;
as n't lie ?"&#xD;
"Wonderfully," returned Charley; "every&#xD;
one is clever at Paris, n'est cc pas?"&#xD;
"Generally, at and after dinner. Beware&#xD;
though of an empty or a badly fed French-&#xD;
man I"&#xD;
The establishment in the Malesherbes was&#xD;
indeed, "princely," and the rooms seemed&#xD;
the embodiment of comfort isn(l luxury&#xD;
un(ler the soft light of the big candelabra.&#xD;
Somers flung himself in herculean abandon&#xD;
on a lounge, and surveyed the scene with&#xD;
deep satisfaction.&#xD;
"Snug, is it not? We were deuced&#xD;
lucky to get them; and now couckons!&#xD;
We have a long day before us to morrow."&#xD;
Charley was only too glad to avail himself&#xD;
of the privilege; he was worn out in mind&#xD;
and boily, though he had not realized it&#xD;
until with a return to quiet the excitement&#xD;
of the (lay was succeeded by the naturdi&#xD;
reaction. He was in a deep, dreamless&#xD;
sleep before Somers had finished his habit-&#xD;
ual half~pipe of tobacco, as that gentleman,&#xD;
&#xD;
glancing in at Charley's door before going&#xD;
to his own room, perceived.&#xD;
Mr. Somers arranged his night toilet in&#xD;
a meditative mood. "Nice boy he seems&#xD;
to be. I wonder whatever can be Huntley's&#xD;
scheme? 'Tie him up 1' llumph! et com-&#xD;
ment? Can't say I like the commission, or,&#xD;
indeed, perceive exactly how the thing is to&#xD;
be done. Just like that inscrutable Dick.&#xD;
Not to hear a word of him in five years,&#xD;
and then be called on tQ play third hand&#xD;
without even knowing what 's trumps.&#xD;
Mais enfin! the campaign opens cheerfully.&#xD;
What an ineffable comfort to have got&#xD;
these quarters, - the ambition of years.&#xD;
Sleep sweetly, Edward, on the field of&#xD;
victory! But how? 'Tie him up' like&#xD;
Schneider to a Post! Good, that was. Elm&#xD;

And Monsieur Edward relapsed into ob-&#xD;

of worldly cares in scriptural phrase.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
LAUGHING LUTETIA.&#xD;
THE bright skies smiled their sweetest&#xD;
the next morning, when the gay world, lin-&#xD;
gering in the Beautiful City to celebrate its&#xD;
concluding summer festivities, opened its&#xD;
drowsy eyes and remembered what day it&#xD;
was. The French "Darby" - since every&#xD;
born Englishman so calls it, it seems absurd&#xD;
to write the word Derby - was a refined&#xD;
copy of the English event. Every one&#xD;
went out to assist at it, for it was run on a&#xD;
Sunday, when all men above the actual sans&#xD;
cut otte are at leisure in Paris, and every one&#xD;
was ecstatic and excited, and thoroughly im-&#xD;
bued with the fantastic enthusiasm with&#xD;
which the Parisian enters into matters of a&#xD;
sportive kind; but the demarcation of class&#xD;
was no less sharply drawn on that day, and&#xD;
of that terrific rowdyism amid unrebuked&#xD;
license of the mob which make the day at&#xD;
Epsom a scene of hideous communism there&#xD;
was no sign at Longehamps. The immacu-&#xD;
late fossil of the Jockey Club and the gilded&#xD;
irresistible of the Maison Dor6e need fear&#xD;
no stain to their matchless exteriors from&#xD;
showers of plebeian eggs or siroccos of lime&#xD;
and flour. There would be no rampant&#xD;
disorder on the road, or brutal and inde-&#xD;
cent exhibitions in the ficid, no private&#xD;
prize-fighting or mountebank prodigies of&#xD;
disgust, no dreadful, invisible phalanx of&#xD;
pickpockets, and little if any of that shame-&#xD;
less drunkenness which makes half a million&#xD;
contemporaneous headaches in London once&#xD;
a year. People would have a "good time,"&#xD;
for, starting out with that object, the Pa-&#xD;
risian knew no such word as fail; and there&#xD;
would be wine and intrigue and wickedness&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
and some exaggerated gayety. Anonyma&#xD;
would sit in high places, and Breda elbow&#xD;
her way to the very side of St. Germain,&#xD;
and the "man as he should be" would smile&#xD;
alike on each; for it was France and Paris,&#xD;
capital du monde, where custom no longer&#xD;
submitted to criticism, and real life scorned&#xD;
the government of rules. It was Sunday,&#xD;
to be sure, though the stone-cutters of An-&#xD;
toine would swarm like bees upon the un-&#xD;
finished Opera house, and Ilanssmann's&#xD;
army of brawny iconoelasts pause no in&#xD;
stant in the cutting of ruthless pathways&#xD;
through whole squares of storied old tene-&#xD;

seventh days. Monday, more than any&#xD;
other, was that of rest; but there would&#xD;
still be a general closing of shops on this,&#xD;
both on the Boulevards and in the by-&#xD;
streets; and the Rive Gauche as well as the&#xD;
northern faubourgs would send its thou-&#xD;
sands to the Lono- Field We might see&#xD;

gay fbte-day robes debouching from a hun-&#xD;
dred streets upon the pretty quals, and&#xD;
merging there into a vast throng from&#xD;
which the several streams will flow down to&#xD;
the trim little Seine steamers for Point du&#xD;
Jour and over the bridges to the Palais&#xD;
Royal, whence start the omnibuses for Passy&#xD;
and Auteuil. An army will reach the Bois&#xD;
by those routes; another will enter it ~&#xD;
pied, trudging patiently, even gayly, the&#xD;
whole long way by the Champs Elys6es and&#xD;
the Avenue of the Empress, pausing at&#xD;
every second step to turn and view the&#xD;
marvellous panorama of the road, and ar-&#xD;
riving hot and wearied, but indefatigable,&#xD;
on the t~round. A cold "bock" of Fon-&#xD;
taine's Vienna beer, a cigarette of apparelal&#xD;
(in which both possibly participate), and&#xD;
Jean and Marie are themselves again. On&#xD;
the great highways rolls the central column&#xD;
of the holiday throng, beau-monde, dem-&#xD;
monde, monde-e'tranger, in an endless va-&#xD;
riety of vehicles, from the cavernous and&#xD;
cumbrous landau of Monsieur le Due, down 4&#xD;
to the simple panier which honest Citizen&#xD;
Duval, purveyor of saucissons to the popu-&#xD;
lation of Popincourt, has engaged at a bar- I&#xD;
gain for the day, and which, with its load&#xD;
of Monsieur and Madame, five children and&#xD;
cocker, - eight, all told; - is dragged along&#xD;
by a single little indomitable horse in the&#xD;
wondrous procession.       -&#xD;
What a spectacle it was I A glittering&#xD;
stream of humanity, winding like an enor-&#xD;
mous serpent along the most beautiful of&#xD;
thoroughfares, which the stranger, standing c&#xD;
at the Obelisk, might follow with his won- f&#xD;
during eye in an unbroken line to the Arch ~&#xD;
of the Star, two miles away.          c&#xD;
A flutter and a trumpet-blast, and the I&#xD;
living river divides along its whole length I&#xD;
to give passage to a squadron of magnificent ~&#xD;
&#xD;
44&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
horsemen, whose helmets of gold and long&#xD;
streaming plumes of silk flash and flaunt in&#xD;
the air as the riders thunder past. They are&#xD;
the mysterious Cent Gardes, and closely fol-&#xD;
lowing roils the imperial equipage, in which&#xD;
sits "our neighbor of the Tuileries" with&#xD;
his wife and child. You know him at once,&#xD;
the gray, stern, watchful face, somewhat&#xD;
softened now as he strives to have it, as he&#xD;
returns the salutes of the people. And you&#xD;
may know her too, the sweet-faced, smiling&#xD;
woman at his side, who bends so gracefully&#xD;
and wins your heart, and even makes you&#xD;
forget that she sits an empress in a stolen&#xD;
chair. The mass closes in n~ain behind&#xD;
them like parted waters; and stemming&#xD;
her way in the wake of the imperial coridge'&#xD;
a blond goddess of the Folies, seated in&#xD;
her coach of triumph, scarcely less splen-&#xD;
did than the Emperor's own, pursues her&#xD;
lightsome route, - a significant picture, at&#xD;
which we smile as we replace our hats.&#xD;
The noon of this day found Chancy and&#xD;
his new friend and guide enjoying a de-&#xD;
lightful breakfast under the shade of inge-&#xD;
niously twined trees at Passy. Somers had&#xD;
preferred this quiet and gradual manner&#xD;
of approach, representing its advantages&#xD;
with the wisdom of experience "We&#xD;
should ham stifled with heat and dust&#xD;
on the road; all the balayeurs in Baby-&#xD;
lon could not reduce the amount of either&#xD;
on the Avenue to-day, though they had the&#xD;
entire Seine in their hose; and as for the&#xD;
crowd, we shall see the cream of it on the&#xD;
field. We can drive out quietly to Pussy,&#xD;
and breakfast luxuriously in a miniature&#xD;
wood, - there's a fair cafd there, where&#xD;
some square yards of nature do duty for a&#xD;
dining-room, - and enter the Bois after-&#xD;
wards at our leisure. I think you will be&#xD;
amused."&#xD;
So they had gone out before the gather-&#xD;
ng of the multitude, and were pleasantly&#xD;
stalled at their rustic table when the tide&#xD;
was beginning to swell in the Champs. And&#xD;
Charley was amused, though to his charmed&#xD;
tenses a lesser cause than the excited and&#xD;
imaginativee Frenchmen about them, who&#xD;
bund all the enchantment of Armida's gar-&#xD;
len in the little enclosure of saplings, and&#xD;
lid homage to their several Amaryllises in&#xD;
in exuberant, pastoral style, ludicrous be-&#xD;
pond description, would have yielded rare&#xD;
delight.&#xD;
"Funny, is n't it?" said Somers, linger.&#xD;

The great stalls were thronged, and the&#xD;
occupants of the imperial pagoda in their&#xD;
places, when our friends arrived at the&#xD;
course, where, procuring betting-ring cards,&#xD;
they left their landau and strolled through&#xD;
the maze of rich equipages. Somers gos-&#xD;
siped in his usual style, as they wound&#xD;
their way leisurely onward. his frequent&#xD;
salutes betokened a numerous acquaintance,&#xD;
and niore than once Chancy felt himself to&#xD;
be the object of close scrutiny by the gay&#xD;
company of some splendid coach.&#xD;
"You see that old shadow over there&#xD;
being taken tender care of?" rattled Som-&#xD;
ers; "that 's Auber, and that other fossil&#xD;
with a perpendicular backbone is Bruns-&#xD;
wick, the man of diamonds. Why, we 're&#xD;
surrounded by the Orphean celebrities!&#xD;
That 's Herv~ yonder; and that little Jew&#xD;
dandy, sitting with the corpulent man, is&#xD;
Jean Offenbach. His companion is Vile-&#xD;
messant, redacteur of the Figaro. There&#xD;
is a merry party of your countrymen. The&#xD;
aroma of independence marks them even&#xD;
in t'iis mixed crowd; only it 's a pity that&#xD;
di y should begin so early and so recklessly&#xD;
on the champagne. You have n't seen the&#xD;
Emperor yet? We will saunter down.&#xD;
Ah 1 1 must stop here an instant."&#xD;
He dropped Chancy's arm as he spoke,&#xD;
and advanced, bowing, to the side of a car-&#xD;
riage which with its occupants was well-&#xD;
nigh hidden from view by the circle of gen-&#xD;
tlemen that surrounded it. Charley, fol-&#xD;
lowing with his eyes the movements of his&#xD;
friend, noted the fact with some curiosity.&#xD;
He did not immediately look again, but&#xD;
when he did so he met the laughing eyes&#xD;
of a lady who had raised herself slightly in&#xD;
her place, evidently to see him; and, over-&#xD;
come by a sudden and unaccountable con-&#xD;
fusion, he moved away abruptly, not hear-&#xD;
ing the little call which Somers gave at the&#xD;
same instant. It was an absurd thing to do,&#xD;
but in five minutes he had hopelessly lost&#xD;
himself in the crowd. He could find nei-&#xD;
ther Somers nor their conveyance, and after&#xD;
fruitless efforts he gave himself up to the&#xD;
situation, sat down philosophically and saw&#xD;
the great French race run by English jock-&#xD;
ics, and after it, not being fanmiliar with&#xD;
the main route, walked briskly back to the&#xD;
barrikre at Passy, and took a cab to the&#xD;
Malesherbes.&#xD;
As for Somers, he excused himself to his&#xD;
fair acquaintance at once, on observing that&#xD;
Charge~ had disappeared, and made an un-&#xD;
availing attempt to find him in the throng.&#xD;
Ho returned alone to the lady's carriage&#xD;
with a rueful face.&#xD;
' Le pauvre Hercule!" cried she whose&#xD;
eyes had routed our Charley. She sat in&#xD;
&#xD;
state, with an elderly lady of smiling mien&#xD;
at her side, and a court of aristocratic gal-&#xD;
lants about her, who were visibly envious&#xD;
of the familiarity accorded to the colossal&#xD;
Englishman. "One would think," she&#xD;
said, "that Omphale had been scolding!&#xD;
Mais, dites doac - who is your Apollo?"&#xD;
Somers smiled saucily, and shook his&#xD;
head at the questioner.&#xD;
"Pardon, Madame Ia Baronne; it is an&#xD;
infant from the land of the IVlohicans, sent&#xD;
to my especial care; he must he spared."&#xD;
"La belle affaire!" laughed the beauty,&#xD;
with a nioue at the Bohemian which sent a&#xD;
thrill through the hearts of the admiring&#xD;
observers assembled. "I honor your scru-&#xD;
ples, my good man, and in recognition&#xD;
of them," she added, leaning forward and&#xD;
speaking to him alone, "I order you to&#xD;
bring him to de~'ftueer to-morrow, peine&#xD;
d'amende! Bon jour, Monsieur le Compte!&#xD;
bon jour, Monsieur Gedran When I~go to&#xD;
the wicked places, I meet all my friends.&#xD;

was giving place to the new-comers, and&#xD;
was bowing a retreat, - "remember my or-&#xD;
ders," and tl~e injunction was accompa-&#xD;
nied by a pretty menace with a fan. Som-&#xD;
ers, too far removed to reply, bowed again,&#xD;
and betook himself, somewhat thoughtfully,&#xD;
to the betting-ring. "What a 'go' that&#xD;
would be, to be sure!" he said to himself,&#xD;
half audibly, as he approached a group of&#xD;
excited sportsmen. A moment later he&#xD;
was inimersed in the affairs of the field, and&#xD;
did not recall the existence of his "charge"&#xD;
until tented in lAs conveyance on the way&#xD;
home. He found our hero comfortably dis-&#xD;
posed on several chairs, tr~ ing to worry&#xD;
through the epigrams of the (1auloi.~ and a&#xD;
French plagiarism on a cigar.&#xD;
"Ah! home all right? how the deuce&#xD;
did you manage to lose yourself so sud-&#xD;
denly? or were you carried off bodily?"&#xD;
"I 'ii be hanged if 1 know!" returned&#xD;
Chancy, assuming the upright. "Neither&#xD;
could 1 make out who won in the race."&#xD;
"0 - the Frenchmen! The English&#xD;
horses were nowhere, and lost everything,&#xD;
precisely as I anticipated. There will he&#xD;
rare offerings to the gods to-night over the&#xD;
success of the French stables. Are you&#xD;

"Very much ready, I might sny~ - I am&#xD;

"Good! we '11 go to Voisin's; it 's con-&#xD;

flickering tights that made it look like a&#xD;
long train of fireflies, leading from the&#xD;
mighty monument to the entrance of the&#xD;
I3oas. A, myriad of air-seekers, in fact,&#xD;
were swarming out again over the same&#xD;
path of the day-throng, filling the avenue,&#xD;
and wellnigh filling the wood, where all the&#xD;
branching roads were flooded with their&#xD;
cabs.&#xD;
"Look at them I" cried Somers, as they&#xD;
passed the Barribre, with that genius of fig-&#xD;
ures in his place who must that day have&#xD;
taken the numbers of ten thousand voitures,&#xD;
and emerged into the forest shade. "The&#xD;
material for crowds in Paris is incredible;&#xD;

the composition of as many more. There&#xD;
is a reserve population which is as inex-&#xD;

say to-night, looking at the Champs and&#xD;
the central Boulevards, that all Paris was&#xD;
divided between them; but here is a league&#xD;
of forest alive with people, and he will find&#xD;
like multitudes at Monceaux, at the Luxem-&#xD;

where. Let him try, for an experiment, to&#xD;
find a corner in Paris to-night where there&#xD;
is not a crowd. I don't believe it can be&#xD;
done!"&#xD;
They made the tour of the lake, and,&#xD;
halting at Fontaine's, lingered long over&#xD;
a refreshing mug of biere de Vienne, gath-&#xD;
ering endless amusement from the study&#xD;
of the merry table-groups about them. it&#xD;
was nearly midnight when they came down&#xD;
the avenue again' into the city, meeting,&#xD;
even at that hour, hundreds of noisy cab-&#xD;
loads pursuing the outward course. Charley&#xD;
could not repress his astonishment&#xD;
"Heavens! do these people never sleep?"&#xD;
"You will repeat the question with more&#xD;
propriety two or three hours hence," said&#xD;
Somers. "Why, life is just beginning now&#xD;
for half of Paris! You shall see. - A Ma-&#xD;
blue, cocker! eveille-toi I"&#xD;
Cocker was fast asleep, of course. Slum-&#xD;
ber is cocker's normal condition in the city&#xD;
of the sleepless, of which he is a mystic and&#xD;
unique production. He responded to Som-&#xD;
ers's sharp orders only by a guttural boa!&#xD;
m'sieu', opening one eye by sleepy instinct&#xD;
when the turning at the avenue Montaigne&#xD;
was reached, and landing them at the illu-&#xD;
mined portal two minutes later, with his&#xD;
organs of vision sealed alike to them, to the&#xD;
many-colored glare, and the stately gens-&#xD;
darmes who ornamented the entrance like&#xD;
monuments of decorative art.&#xD;
"Tell me, cocker," said Somers, laughing,&#xD;
as he gave the man his fare and drink-&#xD;
money, "you have slept the whole way&#xD;
from Fontaine's, eh?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Monsieur has parfaitement raison,"&#xD;
responded the heso of the glazed hat with&#xD;
sober dignity, as he wheeled away to give&#xD;
place to the ever-arriving throng.&#xD;
Mabille was a madness that night as the&#xD;
two entered; even somers gave a little whis-&#xD;
tie as they drew up outside the great cir-cle&#xD;
promenade, and Charley was speechless at&#xD;
the spectacle. Rubens' wildest dream of a&#xD;
bacchanal would be a congregation of color-&#xD;
less shadows beside the scene that met their&#xD;
eyes, and the master-bands which Tiled the&#xD;
walls of the Sistine and the Ducal Palace&#xD;
with writhing masses of humanity might&#xD;
still have shrunk from the task of portraying&#xD;
this. The simple dance-garden - pitiable,&#xD;
gilded mart of flesh that it was - sometimes&#xD;
acquired a kind of dignitysimply by the colos-&#xD;
sal proportions that it took on. It had been&#xD;
thus magnified to-night, and he must have&#xD;
been a rare ascetic who, staii(ling in the&#xD;
full glare of the ensemble, could still dis-&#xD;
member and reduce it to the paltry and hid-&#xD;
eous details of which it was mainly composed.&#xD;
There were legions of women and a great&#xD;
host of men; women of every country, of&#xD;
every hue, of a dozen tongues, and a&#xD;
bewildering variety of dress. The Egyptian&#xD;
girl with her bronze skin and strange, fan-&#xD;
tastic costume; the Italian and the Greek,&#xD;
scarcely less dark, and sharing equally the&#xD;
haunting charm of the black, unfathomable&#xD;
eye of the East; the pure blond Plain-&#xD;
mande, all pale gold and rose,'with a cloud&#xD;
of yellow hair, like Ruhens's Venuses, or&#xD;
better fulfilling, perhaps, the i(lea of the&#xD;
beautiful Scandinavian Fates; and her sister&#xD;
blonde of England, less fair and infinitely&#xD;
coarser, with the man's hand, the man's&#xD;
voice, and little of the woman but her smooth&#xD;
beauty; the North German, with wide Ibre-&#xD;
heads, sleepy blue cycs, plaited hair, and&#xD;
the sadly incongruOus kausfrau look; the&#xD;
tall, thin Russe, flashing with diamonds,&#xD;
thrilling you with strange, imperious eyes,&#xD;
and filling you with wonder at the marvel-&#xD;
lous linguistic skill of the far Northerner;&#xD;
the silent Espagnole, the transplanted Arncr-&#xD;
icaine, and the Parisienne herself, least in&#xD;
beauty but queen unquestioned; the fever-&#xD;
ish, quenchless embodiment of the whole,&#xD;
sacrificing life to passion, and embracing sin&#xD;
with exultant frenzy. And to mate these&#xD;
some hundreds of Frenchmen, sallow, worn,&#xD;
and fleshless men, with circled e~ es warmed&#xD;
into a blaze by absintke, whose very smiles&#xD;
were brutal sneers, and on whom 'wreck'&#xD;
was written iti ineffaceable lines. A spri~k-&#xD;
hug of foreign male faces filled up the pic-&#xD;
ture; here and there an awkward group of&#xD;
cockneydom striving to master the situation,&#xD;
but suffering from evident embarrassment&#xD;
and rather frightened, and other, more&#xD;

all ignored; as the music quickens and from behind brings Charley's hat down&#xD;
the restless throng presses closer about the upon hi~ nose with a crash, and he hears a&#xD;
dancers, with its thousand-tongued clamor shout of triumph, a very silvery shout, in&#xD;
of laughter and applause, more than one his rear. Struggling on t of his hat, he tries&#xD;

with a toss over her arm and springs into like a Titan and holding his own castor in&#xD;

revel, and the dense circle heaves and cigar, "saw you ever one like that? And&#xD;

thrown in, you know, at Mabille. There 's&#xD;
not a whole hat on the ground by this time.&#xD;
Stop at the corner, cocker, while I get a light."&#xD;
"But who smashed my hat?" asked&#xD;
Charley, as Somers put fire to his cigar.&#xD;
Charley was thinking of the pretty hand.&#xD;
"Ah!" replied Somers, deliberately,&#xD;
and between long puffs of his weed, -his&#xD;
thoughts were busy too at the moment, -&#xD;
"you would hardly care to know, at least&#xD;
not now. When you do, you may. But&#xD;
what did you think of the affair? How did&#xD;
it strike you in its grand entireness?"&#xD;
Chanley never thought of resenting the&#xD;
rather dictatorial manner of his friend,&#xD;
which was worn with so much grace that it&#xD;
was scarcely felt. He forgot the parasol&#xD;
for the moment, and went back to the pre-&#xD;
vious scenes.&#xD;
"I could hardly express my opinion," he&#xD;
replied. "I never saw anything like it&#xD;
before, or formed any conception of it."&#xD;
"You should see a bal d'opera," said&#xD;
Somers, who always had the superlative in&#xD;
reserve; "you will see one, probably."&#xD;
"Most likely; in the winter, I suppose."&#xD;
"Yes, after New Year. - Voi~&amp;amp;! the&#xD;
Boulevard; now you might ask, 'When&#xD;
does Paris sleep?' It 's past one o'clock,&#xD;
and look at the walks I"&#xD;
They had entered the Italians by the&#xD;
Rue Luxembourg, and the effect was indeed&#xD;
startling, as the brilliant line of cafe's with&#xD;
their millions of lights,, and the undimin-&#xD;
ished tide of humanity rolling and swelling&#xD;
about them, came into sudden view. They&#xD;
got out at the Grand Hotel, dismissed their&#xD;
panier, and sauntered with the current to&#xD;
the next corner, where, at Somers's sugges-&#xD;
tion, they went across to the Udder for a&#xD;
rognon broclie'.&#xD;
"One must feed the fires, you know; and,&#xD;
in fact, supper at two o'clock is the most&#xD;
natural thing possible at Paris, untimely as&#xD;
it might seem anywhere else. Besides, the&#xD;
last scene of this 'strange, eventful' com-&#xD;
edy is enacted in these and other popular&#xD;
coffee-rooms, and remains to be seen."&#xD;
Charley was nothing loath, to tell the&#xD;
truth, and the broiled kidneys, washed down&#xD;
with warm Bordeaux, were delicious. The&#xD;
retreating army of Mabille arrived, too, in&#xD;
rapid detachments, and the pretty rooms&#xD;
assumed the liveliest possible appearance;&#xD;
everybody was hungry, and a score of nim-&#xD;
ble waiters ran -breathless races to and fro.&#xD;
How they did eat and drink and laugh!&#xD;
How the lights dazzled, and the corks&#xD;
echoed in cheery chorus to merry voices,&#xD;
until the hours stole away, until the air was&#xD;
heavy with Laferme and Moca, and the&#xD;
long day of carousal was growing cold and&#xD;
lifeless among the yesterdays!&#xD;
When our friends emerged upon the&#xD;
&#xD;
SMILES 2&#xD;
&#xD;
Boulevard, daylight was tingling the sky;&#xD;
and as they walked rather lazily toward the&#xD;
Malesherbes, they met more than oiie troop&#xD;
of blouse workmen coming up from the&#xD;
river to their early labor, - heavy-browed&#xD;
men, who eyed them askance and muttered&#xD;
in undertones. Charley might have seen&#xD;
in them the night-sleepers he had looked&#xD;
for, though they slept badly in St. Antoine,&#xD;
and had wild dreams, even in those un-&#xD;
clouded days.&#xD;
"Now," cried Somers, as they entered&#xD;
their cosey parlor at last, "ra te couclier!&#xD;
It is four o'clock; you can have nine hours,&#xD;
and you will need them all."&#xD;
CHAPTER YIII.&#xD;
SMILES AND EYES.&#xD;
IT was not without a certain degree of&#xD;
pleasant excitement that Chancy, roused by&#xD;
somers at noon from a wild vision of hobgob-&#xD;
ha Cent Gardes and dancing girls, proceed-&#xD;
ed to make his toilet, under the eye of his&#xD;
Mentor, for the event of the day, the d4/eu-&#xD;
ner with the lady of the gray eyes. The&#xD;
charm had worked swiftly and surely on&#xD;
our boy-hero; he had strayd in the en-&#xD;
chanted ground, where the spell of the glow-&#xD;
ing present shaded the past and masked the&#xD;
years to come; he wandered in the rose-&#xD;
twined paths in ecstasy, unconscious that&#xD;
they too, like the old Cretan serpentine,&#xD;
led to no end and afforded no retreat.&#xD;
Few men could breathe freely the Paris&#xD;
atmosphere of those days without imbibing&#xD;
something of the subtle poison, and sharing&#xD;
in some measure the intoxication of the&#xD;
time; and Charley was not one to resist or&#xD;
analyze the magic influence. Why should&#xD;
he, indeed? Why question the nature of&#xD;
the charm which made time so swift and&#xD;
sweet, and life so lovely, when one is young&#xD;
and the blood is warm, with all those sober&#xD;
years yet to come, in which, if nued be, one&#xD;
may make amends for the follies of his&#xD;
youth, and be blessed after the manner of&#xD;
the world? The vexed problem of an ex-&#xD;
hausted civilization or the inexorable logic&#xD;
of antecedents were not likely to disturb&#xD;
his enjoyment of visible effects. Paris&#xD;
might be, as it was, the fevered brain where&#xD;
the disease of the nation was centredcon-&#xD;
suming its victim with hidden fires; to&#xD;
Charley - to any of us, wondering strangers&#xD;
within its gates - it was only gay, brilliant&#xD;
Paris. We might, indeed, recoil at times&#xD;
from the too scorching heat; we might own&#xD;
to a silent relief in the thought that it was&#xD;
not our abiding-place nor yet our country,&#xD;
and we should not have eared to call the men&#xD;
and women we saw there brothers and&#xD;
sisters before the world; still we were not&#xD;
&#xD;
called on to dream sad dreams of "Greece,&#xD;
Rime, Carthage," in its sunny streets, or&#xD;
con the melancholy lesson of national decay.&#xD;
And we did not, - did we, sir? Not we;&#xD;
though you, as representing the peculiarly&#xD;
rigid community of Churchtown, might have&#xD;
done so with some propriety. But then -&#xD;
you know how it was!&#xD;
I remember standing once before that&#xD;
strangely suggestive painting of Couture's&#xD;
in the gallery of Luxembourg, Les Rb-&#xD;
mains de la De'cadencc. It shows a wild&#xD;
revel of degenerate Romans, who have cho-&#xD;
sen the very tribune of the Forum fbr the&#xD;
scene of their debauch, and the groups of&#xD;
wine and drug maddened men and women&#xD;
are drawn with startling power. Those&#xD;
who have seen it will not readily forget it, -&#xD;
the two or three splendid but ruined faces&#xD;
among the women in the foreground, and&#xD;
the delirious agony of' one who stands in&#xD;
middle - distance, tearing her hair, with&#xD;
shrieks; the man who ~clings reeling to a&#xD;
column, holding out his overflowing cup to&#xD;
the stern bust of Cicero, with an idiot's&#xD;
mockery; the crouching slave who pnurs&#xD;
the crimson Falernian, and casts stealthy&#xD;
glances at the brutes who are yet his mas-&#xD;
ters; and the two sad, thoughtful citizens&#xD;
in humble dress who pause to note the scene.&#xD;
An intelligent Frenchman was my com-&#xD;
panion, and observed my interest.&#xD;
"More majoruin!" he said, laughing;&#xD;
"but they do it better at ."&#xD;
Chancy was guilty of some trifling vani-&#xD;
ties - rather exceptional for him they were&#xD;
- in the process of dressincr before alluded&#xD;
to. In fact, the laughing glance that had&#xD;
met his own on the race-ground lingered&#xD;
persistently in his memory, - it was only a&#xD;
part of the Paris spell, perhaps,-- and he&#xD;
had a youthful desire to look his best&#xD;
before the unknown. Somers, who was&#xD;
stretched ponderously on a lounge, watched&#xD;
the young man with a curious smile.&#xD;
"By Jove!" he cried, at length, laughing I&#xD;
his musical, contagious laugh, "you sur-&#xD;
pass the traditions, Charley. We are fa- 1&#xD;
niliar with the lamb which goes meekly to&#xD;
Ic sacrifice, but for that which studies the I&#xD;
minutise of pleasing ornament for the cere-&#xD;
mony we are scarcely prepared." 1&#xD;
The merry Colossus, however, was well&#xD;
pleased with his charge. If a third party I&#xD;
had been on the scene, and a commentary&#xD;
possible, his thought would have been ex- I&#xD;
pressed in the words, "Handsome~dog, is n't I&#xD;
he?" As it was, his unspoken reflection&#xD;
took another form, and an inspiration pro-&#xD;
cisely identical with that which had given t&#xD;
him a little shock the day previous at Long-&#xD;
champs led to the i'eiteration of the thought, e&#xD;
"That wou'd be a 'go'!"&#xD;
If I have failed critically to describe my ~&#xD;
&#xD;
.&#xD;
&#xD;
LND EYES.                           51&#xD;
hero in any foregoing page, the failure is&#xD;
due to my confidence that my amiable read-&#xD;
er would never suspect me of introducing&#xD;
in that capacity any other than a "hand-&#xD;
some dog," as described by Monsieur Som-&#xD;
ers. I leave that dangerous innovation to&#xD;
writers of a bolder school than mine, espe-&#xD;
cially as I am dealing with certain ingredi-&#xD;
eats of fact; and I can satisfactorily assure&#xD;
the reader that Charley richly deserved the&#xD;
encomium bestowed by his friend. Not so&#xD;
bad a one, indeed, after all; for among the&#xD;
millions of dogs, as well as men, we all know&#xD;
how few are "handsome "I The "Man in&#xD;
the Club Window," who, with true English&#xD;
acumen, puts the whole world in the cruci-&#xD;
ble of Pall Mall, would have said of young&#xD;
Wales, "There 's a fine specimen of your&#xD;
American; pity he will not wear his&#xD;
beard!" And the Ladies of the Lake, t'se&#xD;
winsome nainds ol~ the Bois, and no bad&#xD;
judges, would have cried with one voice,&#xD;
"My God! what eyes! what petite pretty&#xD;
feet! c'est un Rassiqniac!"&#xD;
As he stood at last completely arrayed,&#xD;
and lighted cigar number one for the day,&#xD;
he might have been photographed as a man&#xD;
of rather more than medium height, slight&#xD;
without being slim, with the straight, down-&#xD;
ward lines in trunk and limb of the immor-&#xD;
tal Archer in the Belvedere Court. Short,&#xD;
curling, dark brown hair fell over a low,&#xD;
wide forehead, below which the big brown&#xD;
eyes slept, like unmanned fires, undi~r the&#xD;
womanish lashes. A luxuriant mustache&#xD;
hid the rather full mouth,- the only posi-&#xD;
tively faulty feature he had. The nose was&#xD;
straight and well defined, -the rarest beau-&#xD;
ty, I fancy, in the human physiognomy. One&#xD;
found a littl~suspected squareness in the&#xD;
chin and jaw, but the neck below was full&#xD;
and round like a woman's, and displayed as&#xD;
it was by the low, broad collar of' the day,&#xD;
dipping in front to the bone, gave him&#xD;
something of a softer feminine look. His&#xD;
dress required no criticism; Somers admit-&#xD;
ted as much in his heart, and was silent.&#xD;
"What then is the hour prescribed for&#xD;
these afternoon ' breakfasts'?" asked Char-&#xD;
Ley, spinning a ring of smoke before him as&#xD;
he spoke.&#xD;
"We are expected at two o'clock. You&#xD;
nust forswear your transatlantic measure-&#xD;
nents of time, Charley, with us. I don't&#xD;
mow what they are; something like our&#xD;
l~nglish divisions, probably, which I have&#xD;
forgotten . In Paris life never begins he-&#xD;
'ore the meridian hour, and takes its repose&#xD;
srhen it likes. You laugh at the epidemic&#xD;
prevalencee of clocks; but it is just because&#xD;
heir office is ignored that they are tolerated&#xD;
a such profusion. There are only two&#xD;
vents in the daily revolution of a Parisian&#xD;
rhich make it necessary to consult a time-&#xD;
dece,-~-his dinner and the rendezvous."&#xD;
&#xD;

52                        CHOISY.                                                         SMILES AND EYES.&#xD;
&#xD;
The speaker brought himself to a sitting&#xD;
posture as he spoke, and consulted his own&#xD;
watch.&#xD;
"Is this a dinner then, or a 'rendezvous,'&#xD;
my noble Frenchman?" asked Chancy,&#xD;
with a puff and a smile.&#xD;
"Ma foi, Charles 1" cried Somers, ris-&#xD;
ing, "I venture no guess. I can read nei-&#xD;
ther stars nor women, wh&amp;amp; are equally be-&#xD;
yond our mortal ken. We are favored&#xD;
souls; that 's all I know, and, like discreet&#xD;
persons as we are, let us accept the good&#xD;
fortune without questioning the eyeless&#xD;
deity, - a clear case of 'no talking' to the&#xD;
genius of the wheel, ehi A/ions! I want&#xD;
to hear how our new coup~ strikes you. 1&#xD;
have n't seen it, but I left it to Vernay, and&#xD;
he does nothing badly."&#xD;
The vehicle was at its post, a natty&#xD;
affair in aristocratic green, with a smart,&#xD;
handsome cob and a well-fed Jehu, all&#xD;
smiles, drab cloth, and gilt buttons. Som-&#xD;
ers was pleased: "Neat, is n't it? Cinder-&#xD;
ella's pumpkin reduced to the modest re-&#xD;
quirements of two quiet young men. Cocker&#xD;
15 a jewel. M'sieur Stokes, is it not?"&#xD;
"Non, Monsieur, je me nomme Gabriel."&#xD;
"Bab! it 'a out of. all propriety; we&#xD;
want the affair of the horse, horsy. Ob-&#xD;
serve, my good man, that you are hereafter&#xD;
'Stokes,' and nothing but 'Stokes,' and&#xD;
that we take the curb for nobody."&#xD;
It is to be doubted if the personage in&#xD;
drab entirely relished the summary meta-&#xD;
morphosis of his cognomen; but he closed&#xD;
the door with a gay smile, and, in obedi-&#xD;
ence to Somers's instructions, whirled them&#xD;
across to the precincts of Monceaux, draw-&#xD;
ing up at the closed porte-coch&amp;amp;e of a large&#xD;
residence in the Avenue de la Reine Hor-&#xD;
tense. Somers dismissed the coup~ and led&#xD;
the way through a flowery court to a door&#xD;
where they were ceremoniously received by&#xD;
a servant in livery, and conducted to a luxu-&#xD;
rious reception-room opening upon an en-&#xD;
closed garden, and breezy with perfume.&#xD;
Charley was in considerable bewilderment,&#xD;
from which he was aroused on the instant&#xD;
by Somers, and presented with some for-&#xD;
mality to a lady of rather more than middle&#xD;
age, but of aristocratic demeanor, who had&#xD;
entered immediately after themselves. She&#xD;
acknowledged Charley's low bow with much&#xD;
grace, and launched at once into that easy&#xD;
flow of words which is the unfailing re-&#xD;
source of the Frenchwoman at all times&#xD;
and in all circumstances. She was de-&#xD;
lighted to know Monsieur ~Vales, both as a&#xD;
friend of Monsieur Somers and as a repre-&#xD;
sentative of the great country beyond the&#xD;
sea. She cherished a profound interest in&#xD;
l'Ame'rique. She had an ancient relative,&#xD;
en effrt, since dead, who had performed&#xD;
prodigies of valor under- the General La-&#xD;
fayette against the negroes en Bre'szl, was it&#xD;
&#xD;
not? And she had devoured with ecstasy&#xD;
in earlier days those charming legends cf&#xD;
Coupaire and ce charmant Mon6ieur Gu/V-&#xD;
va~re. Would the gentlemen sit; and how,&#xD;
monsieur, had he found it, the Paris? Ma-&#xD;
dame Ia Baronne had run away far one lit-&#xD;
tle moment; she goes to come immediately.&#xD;
And on the word the lady entered, com-&#xD;
ing in with a little stumble and a real of&#xD;
laughter as a microscopic terrier, victim of&#xD;
unlucky chance, darted with a ~ elp from his&#xD;
hiding-place in the rug of foaming llama,&#xD;
where her foot had caught him. Chancy&#xD;
came to his feet half dazed, preserving&#xD;
just sufficient self-possession to repeat his&#xD;
deep obeisance as Somers's voice fell on his&#xD;
ear.&#xD;
"Madame la Baronne, permettez; Mon-&#xD;
sieur Charles Wales; voici vos ordres ol3e'is!"&#xD;
"C'est bien fait, - merci."&#xD;
In this instant of by-play Chancy stood&#xD;
voiceless, an amusing mixture of grace and&#xD;
qaucherie, with his gaze fixed on the hostess.&#xD;
The recollection of the grand eyes at Long-&#xD;
champs, lingering as it was, had scarcely&#xD;
prepared him for the magnificent woman&#xD;
who now smiled before him. Her dress&#xD;
was an exquisite morning neqlige' of some&#xD;
misty material which melted into a foam of&#xD;
lace about her neck and shoulders, and fell&#xD;
in soft, airy folds along her fbrm, like a&#xD;
tissue of snow, shortened in front, so that&#xD;
the tiny slippers with their square buckles&#xD;
of gold peeped out as she walked. Masses&#xD;
of dark hair were gathered carelessly in a&#xD;
great knot at the back of her head, from&#xD;
which a shower of curls fell far below her&#xD;
shoulders, kept in place apparently by a&#xD;
mimic dagger with a diamond hilt. It was&#xD;
the only ornament she wore; there was not&#xD;
so much as a ring upon the hand she ex-&#xD;
tended with a winning smile to Charley, as&#xD;
she glided across to him, a perfect girl-god-&#xD;
dess in her fresh and rosy loveliness. He&#xD;
took it awkwardly, and was making a des-&#xD;
perate struggle ~o frame an appropriate sen-&#xD;
tence in French~ when she spoke to him, with&#xD;
a divining look, in English pure as his own.&#xD;
"I am most happy to meet you, Mr.&#xD;
Wales, and you are very good to come.&#xD;
That naughty Hercules !It was just an ac-&#xD;
cident that I learned he had a friend come&#xD;
from the end of the world to see our beau-&#xD;
tiful Paris, and obtained the privilege of&#xD;
contributing my mite to make it pleasant&#xD;
for you. He knows that his friends are&#xD;
mine. You are quite in disgrace, indeed&#xD;
you are, Monsieur Somers," she continued,&#xD;
and added mischievously, in a lower tone,&#xD;
". and I turn you bodily over to the tender&#xD;
mercies of Mamma Grandoie."&#xD;
"But, Madame, I do assure you&#xD;
"Silence "she cried, with a pretty, tragi-&#xD;
cal stamp, "assure me nothing. Go and do&#xD;
your penance I"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
She broke into a little silvery laugh at&#xD;
the fine Bohemian moved away disconsolate&#xD;
towards the .A~gis. "Le pauvre hon homme&#xD;
But you are not long in Paris, Mr. XVales?&#xD;
"I arrived but four days since."&#xD;
"And you like it?" with a pretty eleva-&#xD;
tion of her eyebrows.&#xD;
Charley was recovering, and he replied&#xD;
that he had found it the "most delightful&#xD;
spot on earth."&#xD;
She looked innocently interested. "It&#xD;
seems very popular with your countrymen,&#xD;
of whom we see so many and meet so few.&#xD;
Is it not absurd that you are really the first&#xD;
American I have ever met in my house?&#xD;
I have many English friends, however.&#xD;
Tell me, is it true that you say in America,&#xD;
'We shall go to Paris when we die'?"&#xD;
"If we are good, it is the hope of our&#xD;
lives, madame; I am only just learning&#xD;
how happy a one it is; but- do people die&#xD;
here?"&#xD;
"Ma/heureusement! I believe so; and&#xD;
you are here snce four days only" (the&#xD;
home. idiom, which never entirely quits the&#xD;
French tongue made her English very piq-&#xD;
uant). "I must suspect you have been fbr-&#xD;
tunate in discovering attractions.~~&#xD;
"Ma(lame suspects with ~ said&#xD;
Charley, bowing; the little glimmer of&#xD;
merriment in her eyes made him bolder, and&#xD;
he a(lded, " I am only puzzled to understand&#xD;
in what unhappy atmosphere I have hereto-&#xD;
fore existe(l."&#xD;
She looked comically sympathetic, but&#xD;
smiled ineredul~usly.&#xD;
Was it so bad? but then, Mr. Wales, at&#xD;
your years much can be done to repair the&#xD;
losses of a previously dull life. Paris will&#xD;
do you good."&#xD;
Heaven knows what foolish thing Charley&#xD;
had on his tongue to say, but at that mo-&#xD;
ment a grave functionary opened and shut&#xD;
himself twice at the door and then an-&#xD;
nounced the d~7euner. Charley gave his&#xD;
arm to the Baronne, and they proceeded to&#xD;
the breakfast-room, followed by the others.&#xD;
The meal, perfect in its details and delight-&#xD;
ful beyond words in its easy familiarity,&#xD;
was a revelation to Charley; one does not&#xD;
always discover in our home-land that she,&#xD;
the ~vomar, who gives a ~grace and smooth-&#xD;
ness to the rough surface of our lives, may&#xD;
even extend her influence to the ceremony&#xD;
of eating, and rob that exercise of what t~he&#xD;
fastidious are sometimes fain to term its&#xD;
"vulgarity." But the Baronne in her place&#xD;
as hostess was at once the beaming woman&#xD;
and the watchful dispenser of her bounty;&#xD;
a spniteall wit and smiles, and yet a con-&#xD;
vive with whom the art of eating was to eat,&#xD;
and eat freely. Charley first wondered and&#xD;
then admired as, perhaps, he had never be-&#xD;
fore admired a woman.&#xD;
"1 will not have you slight my wine, Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Wales, it is too good to be neglected," said&#xD;
the Baronne severely, as Chancy, like the&#xD;
barbarian he was, ignored the brimming&#xD;
glass by his plate.&#xD;
"Your pardon, madame, and your health,&#xD;
if you will permit me. it is the elixir of the&#xD;
gods," he added, recoverinoP his wits under&#xD;
the inspiration of the drau~t.&#xD;
"Bon! what is the Olympian judgment,&#xD;
Monsieur Hercules?" cried the lady,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
"Apollo has said it, madame," replied&#xD;
Somers; 1 moi, I have had the blessed privi-&#xD;
lege of former acquaintance with it, and I&#xD;
drink in tears."&#xD;
" ('ommeut ce/a? tears!"&#xD;
"Ay I that I must needs ever drink any&#xD;
other. My dear Madame Grandoic," he&#xD;
continued, turning to his vis-is-vis with a&#xD;
comic solemnity which sent the Baronne&#xD;
into a spasm of suppressed merriment, "let&#xD;
me not be outdone by my chivalrous friend.&#xD;
Madame, your good and continued health.&#xD;
May you long rejoice in the possession of&#xD;
those graces which win all hearts and&#xD;
brighten the existence of all about you!"&#xD;
Madame acknowledged very graciously&#xD;
what, being delivered in English, she had&#xD;
very imperfectly understood.&#xD;
"Poor mama~a Grandoie," said the Ba-&#xD;
ronne, in an undertone to Charley, "she al-&#xD;
ways accepts his nonsense so soberly. But&#xD;
you have nothing to eat! a bit of this pdte',&#xD;
will you not? Robert, server ceci is monsieur."&#xD;
But do you not speak French, Mr. Wales?"&#xD;
"Sans fa~on, madame, as I was unhap-&#xD;
py enough to treat your wine," replied Char-&#xD;
icy, in that tongue.&#xD;
"Mais / - why, that is excellent; and all&#xD;
this time you have made me talk in my poor&#xD;
English I"&#xD;
"Your English is perfect, madame, as I&#xD;
am sure is everything you do!"&#xD;
"Ah, but you should always use the&#xD;
French, Monsieur Wales," she returned with&#xD;
an arch smile.&#xD;
- "Whypray?"&#xD;
"Because it is the language of compli-&#xD;
ment, par exce//ence. Monsieur Somers,"&#xD;
she continued, severely, "why did you not&#xD;
tell me that Mr. Wales spoke French -&#xD;
mechant I"&#xD;
"Dignefemme! I forgot that trifle. But&#xD;
I told you he was a prodigy, and, fbr aught I&#xD;
know, he speaks all the known tongues. In&#xD;
his country they do everything on that mag-&#xD;
nificent scale. I have heard the infants -"&#xD;
"Strangle the serpents in their cradles;&#xD;
n'est ce pas, mon Hercu/e? But the Ameri-&#xD;
can women are very lovely, are they not,&#xD;
Monsieur Wales?"&#xD;
For his life Charley could not repress a&#xD;
flush, which the Baronne noted with an arch&#xD;
smile. Somers also saw it, and came to the&#xD;
rescue.&#xD;

"Ali! madame, permit me to shelter the&#xD;
modesty of my friend. With the sole ex-&#xD;
ceptions of yourself and Madame Grandoie,&#xD;
the American women are the loveliest in&#xD;
the world. It is the verdict of the na-&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
"Then we poor daughters of France can&#xD;
hold but a low rank among the attractions of&#xD;
Paris in your esteem, Mr. Wales," said the&#xD;
hostess, rather demurely.&#xD;
"Ma(lame," returned Charley, who had&#xD;
regained his self-possession with the unob-&#xD;
serve(l aid of a glass of wine, "Monsieur&#xD;
Somers deals with a popular but flattering&#xD;
fiction. 1, who am an American, have only&#xD;
learned at Paris what beauty in a womaxi&#xD;
may be!"&#xD;
&amp;amp;mers experienced a wild desire to&#xD;
whistle, hut took his wine instead, afl(l&#xD;
glanceil furtively at the depleted bottle'&#xD;
at Chancy's side. The latter, as it may&#xD;
be inferred, was unaware what he was&#xD;
drinking. Somers could have given him&#xD;
name and date for a rare vintage of the&#xD;
Gironde, of which every drop was costly as&#xD;
a jewel; lie only knew it was some blood-&#xD;
warming, spirit-stirring draught which filled&#xD;
his veins with an unwanted fire and in-&#xD;
spired a ready gayety which preserved him&#xD;
from any further lapses into confusion. ~I lie&#xD;
Baronmie experienced the force of this change,&#xD;
when, after a merry interlude in which her&#xD;
woman's wit flashed ceaseless repartee to&#xD;
Somers's ever~ amusing l~avardage, ~vhile it&#xD;
held Charley in wondering admiration, and&#xD;
even elicited some mild scintillations from&#xD;
Madame Grandoic, she returned strategeti-&#xD;
cally to the charge, and asked him suddenly,&#xD;
with laughing eyes, "And is there no&#xD;
.~none mourning her runaway Paris on&#xD;
some hill in the sunset land?" for Charley,&#xD;
with unblushing impudence and a bow&#xD;
worthy of D'Orsay himself, replied, "Ma-&#xD;
dame, we feel that Paris could have had no&#xD;
hove before Helen." And the lively Ba-&#xD;
ronne was herself nonplussed for the mo-&#xD;
ment by the quick retort and the big lion's-&#xD;
eyes looking full in her own.&#xD;
When the gentlemen came away some&#xD;
time later, Somers seized an instant to&#xD;
speak to the Baronne.&#xD;
"Et l'enfhnt'i" lie asked.&#xD;
"II est gentle, l'enfarmt, mon Hereule."&#xD;
She had this day a thousand little press-&#xD;
ing cares of preparation for departure from&#xD;
t~wn, but she seemed to forget them at that&#xD;
moment. She stood thoughtfully by the&#xD;
open window of the drawing-room after her&#xD;
guests had gone, forgetting even to tantalize&#xD;
the mite of a terrier who hovered about her&#xD;
feet, more alarmed than gratified by her&#xD;
umisual forbearance. Madame Grandoic&#xD;
looked in nn(l exclaimed, " Que fais-toi?&#xD;
The landau is waiting, ma cke'rie, and you&#xD;
are not even dressed."&#xD;
&#xD;
"lam coming," she answered, turning with&#xD;
an absent air. Passing the piano, she paused,&#xD;
and presently pulled out one of the sheets&#xD;
of music; from a box of crayons on a sido&#xD;
table she selected one with which she&#xD;
dashed off, skilfully and rapidly, a cartoon&#xD;
of a male head, short close-curling hair,&#xD;
broad forehead, great shaded eyes, droop-&#xD;
ing mustache, with straggling ends, and the&#xD;
full, square chin, -- Charley Wales for a&#xD;
(lucat, as the whole Mayflower Club could&#xD;
have sworn. The portrait finbhed, she&#xD;
studied it attentively; one could have seen&#xD;
the woman's divining, penetrating instinct&#xD;
all aflame in the eyes which strove to read&#xD;
the hidden meaning of that pictured face.&#xD;
It read too Well, - the frank, smiling eyes,&#xD;
the manly lines of brow and jaw, with a&#xD;
strange softness irradiating all. Men wore&#xD;
such faces, she had seen them; but their&#xD;
hearts -? No, they are only masks, one&#xD;
anti all of them!&#xD;
The bewildered Grandoic reappeared at&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
"Mais, voyons! petite, it is Ilenriette and&#xD;
Frederick and time pedicure, and all the&#xD;
world qui l'attends lou/ours!"&#xD;
"Bon! I fly, ma vicille."&#xD;
It was not often that this last expression&#xD;
of endearment fell on the good woman's&#xD;
ears; when it did she was wont to retreat&#xD;
in confusion and seek refuge in her own&#xD;
apartment, where she would bestow a fur-&#xD;
tive glance upon herself in the mirror and&#xD;
shed a few easy tears. She did as much on&#xD;
this occasion, while the Baronne, pausing to&#xD;
take a farewell look at her croquis, put it&#xD;
carefully among the sheets of music, and&#xD;
went off to Henriette, and pedicure, and" all&#xD;
the world."&#xD;
Meantime our Charley, left to himself on&#xD;
the crowded walk of the Champs Elys~es&#xD;
by Somers, who had to run away to settling&#xD;
day at the club, was wenklyfollowing the sug-&#xD;
gestion of that worthy to "take a stroll, and&#xD;
see the promenade in its expiring glory; for&#xD;
you know," he had added, "the court goes to&#xD;
St. Cloud on Wednesday, and Paris will be&#xD;
deserted simultaneously by the entire monde."&#xD;
But though the afternoon ti(le was at its&#xD;
full, Chiarley wandered absently along, see-&#xD;
ing only the one face with its ever-laughing,&#xD;
ever-unfathomable eyes, the long soft tresses,&#xD;
and tIme white shoulders under the spray of&#xD;
lace. He trod on a dozen dressess and&#xD;
made as many unintelbgible apologies, after&#xD;
which he became suddenly ~nware that lie&#xD;
was contributing an immense amount of&#xD;
amusement to a host of promnenaders, and&#xD;
roused himself sufficiently to jump into a&#xD;
cab and effect his escape - to the Male-&#xD;
sherbes. Here he flung himself royally on&#xD;
a sofa, and experienced something like sur-&#xD;
prise in the reflection that this was absolute-&#xD;
ly the first moment of restful solitude he had&#xD;
&#xD;
had since his arrival at Paris, - the fix&#xD;
respite in the whirl of that magic life in&#xD;
which lie had made so sudden an entrauc&#xD;
A season of thoughtfulness came with&#xD;
and, going to the secretary, he hunted out&#xD;
unfinished letter from among a mass of p&#xD;
pers tossed carelessly therein. He set 01&#xD;
conscientiously to read it, having forgottc&#xD;
its contents, but he found the task una&#xD;
countable tiresome, and after a moment&#xD;
Iiesitatioii lie added a few hurried lines&#xD;
the sheet, closed and sealed it, ~tnd wx&#xD;
scrawling the superscription with a guilt&#xD;
conscience-stricken look, when the do~&#xD;
flew open with a crash, and Somers cam&#xD;
in. lIe had just time to toss the letter in&#xD;
drawer, and I may as well sketch its subs&#xD;
quent history. The amiable Somers foun&#xD;
it there some months later, and read the a~&#xD;
dress with elevated eyebrows and shrugged&#xD;
shoulders, after which he enclosed it dutiful&#xD;
to Mr. Richard Huntley at New York, "V&#xD;
be handed by him to the interesting 'ad&#xD;
dressed,' whom, no doubt, lie had the hap&#xD;
pines to possess on his list of acquaint&#xD;
ances." Whereat Mr. Iluntley d-d Mi&#xD;
Somers's "ilnpu(lence," but was nevertheless&#xD;
glad to possess the enclosure.&#xD;
"Ah!" cried the new-coiner, "here yoi&#xD;
are. The vulgar world of the Champ&#xD;
had no charms for you after the feast che~&#xD;
the goddess supreme, - eli? You have no'&#xD;
told me what you think of her, by the way.'&#xD;
"1 should think there could be only orn&#xD;
opinion," said Charley, rather coolly; some&#xD;
how Somers's light speech grated on hh&#xD;
nerves at the moment.&#xD;
"No more there can, my dear boy," con~&#xD;
tinted Somers, detecting instantly lik&#xD;
friend's irritation, and speaking in a warm&#xD;
but sober tone, "especially when she beamt&#xD;
and radiates as she did to-day. It may&#xD;
sound foolish, but you were favored, Char-&#xD;
hey. I have seen her an icicle to the best&#xD;
of them. She 's an enigma, is Nina Choisy,&#xD;
but as good as gold."&#xD;
"Nina Choisy?"&#xD;
"Yes, when we dare be so familiar, far&#xD;
away, you know. She is 'ha Baronne&#xD;
Choisy' to the grand world. Did I not tell&#xD;
you her name&#xD;
"No, and I wondered ~-"&#xD;
"And wondered at mSr privileged famil-&#xD;
iarity, too, probably. Well, she and my&#xD;
youngest sister were twins in affection at&#xD;
Madame Gaspard's pension here in Paris.&#xD;
I made the most of their friendship, and she&#xD;
is wonderfully good to me. I have been&#xD;
mon Ilercule some years now, and there&#xD;
is n't a man in Paris who would n't give his&#xD;
head for my place in her favor. I don't&#xD;
mind telling~ you that I have been hopelessly&#xD;
in love with her since the first hour I saw&#xD;
her," continued Somers, lighting a cherished&#xD;
pipe; "bad case of the unrequited, mais,&#xD;
&#xD;
'st que voulez-vous?" Aud the giant's shru'~&#xD;
to was a magnified but ridiculously faithful&#xD;
e. copy of the grimace with which every&#xD;
it, born Frenchman accompanies that favoi'ite&#xD;
m phrase. "Ned Somers shall die, and worms&#xD;
a- shall eat him, but not for love. Would you&#xD;
at believe it, she flung that identical senti-&#xD;
a ment at me, like another Rosalind, one day&#xD;
e. when the fever was on me and I attempted&#xD;
's the theatrical? I had sat lap all night,&#xD;
~o smoked a pound of capparal and drank a&#xD;
is gallon of caf~ noir to aid the effect. She is&#xD;
~, good to me, though, and it wakes the chival-&#xD;
)r nc spark. 1 had an ai~cestor who was an&#xD;
e entire crusade in miniature; his picture&#xD;
a hangs in the old hall at home, and they say&#xD;
i- I am like him. Fancy me in penny-mail&#xD;
d and a buskin I Yet am I not warlike? But&#xD;
I- I would make a Paynim holocaust any day&#xD;
d of substituted Frenchmen for Nina Choisy,&#xD;
y and I think she knows it."&#xD;
o   Charley was pleased and puzzled by this&#xD;
1- queer mixture of nonsense and feeling. He&#xD;
was beginning to like his great man-mastiff&#xD;
very much, without in any degree pene-&#xD;
trating his character. Somers, stretched on a&#xD;
s lounge, puffed silently after his speech; and&#xD;
Chancy summoned courage to ask what&#xD;
i was in effect a foolish question, since its&#xD;
s answer was and had been palpable to him.&#xD;
Perhaps he struggled still, or hoped blindly&#xD;
against the truth. "And yet, of course,&#xD;
she is married, is she not?"&#xD;
Somers drew in his breath at the words,&#xD;
and blew a great white cloud slowly into&#xD;
space before he replied, "Yes, married as&#xD;
they marry in France; married to a shadow&#xD;
* whom no one has ever seen, and to some&#xD;
thousands of acres which furnished the&#xD;
hush-money required in such contracts. I&#xD;
I am no student of social ethics, Charley, and&#xD;
* I am an infant in the moral philosophies;&#xD;
* but if there is a character on earth I pity,&#xD;
and for whom I have unquestioning charity,&#xD;
it is for the Frencliwoman who is wedded&#xD;
to a rag of law and a chateau, and buried&#xD;
~alive just as she becomes a woman!"&#xD;
Somers checked himself abruptly and&#xD;
sucked his pipe. "We must n't get on&#xD;
that ground here, though, it 's a mortal of-&#xD;
fence in Paris and to Paris," he resumed&#xD;
with new gayety. "Bury the moralities,&#xD;
mon enfant, or pack your trunks; it is the&#xD;
philosophy of the time and place!" Where-&#xD;
upon the speaker rose and laid aside the&#xD;
exhausted meerschaum, looked at his watch&#xD;
and yawned like a griffin. "Six o'clock!&#xD;
We will dine late, i(you are not otherwise&#xD;
disposed; dress first, a9d drop in comfort-&#xD;
ably at the opera after our cigars Patti's&#xD;
last night, and a great squeeze. You will&#xD;
see everybody, and get a word with our host-&#xD;
ess of the afternoon in her box, though I&#xD;
promise you not without a struggle. She&#xD;
shares with Diva the homage of the house."&#xD;
&#xD;

56                        CHOISY.                                                        SMILES AKD EYES.                   57&#xD;
&#xD;
Charley heard the proposition with a&#xD;
thrill of delight which he neither paused to&#xD;
analyze nor struggled to repress. He ran&#xD;
away to his room, and was dressed a full&#xD;
half-hour before his companion, who smiled&#xD;
beneath a mask of suap-fuam, when, sus-&#xD;
pending his ablutions for an instant, he&#xD;
turned to view the young man radiant in&#xD;
evening dress.&#xD;
"Egad! you '11 excuse me, but you are&#xD;
rather magnificent," spluttered Somers. To&#xD;
himself, later, screened in a towel that&#xD;
would have served for a bedspread, he mu&#xD;
tered, "Deuced little of the Puritan in-&#xD;
stinct in him!" Once that afternoon the&#xD;
thought had made him uneasy, but he rea-&#xD;
soned well and watched closely, did Mon-&#xD;
sieur Somers, and his conclusion, as above&#xD;
expressed, was substantially correct. He&#xD;
had little to fear from an obstruction of&#xD;
that character in the development of his&#xD;
plans, - plans that fate was hurrying to&#xD;
sudden consummation. Already he thought&#xD;
he saw the end, and smiled at himself in&#xD;
the glass, and shrugged the elephantine&#xD;
shoulders as he gave his long, soft whiskers&#xD;
a last stroke. "3Iais! ce n'est pas moil&#xD;
it was always Dick Huntley's luck. For-&#xD;
tune has ever dealt him trumps, only he&#xD;
would play out of rule."&#xD;
"What did you say? "asked Charley, in&#xD;
all innocence, appearing at the door as if&#xD;
summoned.&#xD;
"Me? Did I speak? It must have been&#xD;
to myself, unconsciously. 'There are some&#xD;
men so loose of soul,' you know, and I was&#xD;
thinking about Hamilton, ass that he is,&#xD;
backing his scrubs against the French field.&#xD;
it must have cost him a nice penny. Are&#xD;
you ready? Bon! speaking of Hamilton,&#xD;
suppose we dine at the Maison Dor$e; it&#xD;
will be convenient."&#xD;
The Italien was thronged as Charley and&#xD;
Somers entered somewhat late in the even-&#xD;
ing. Our hero had puffed away two cigars&#xD;
very impatiently after their dinner, while&#xD;
the placid Bohemian calmly finished a single&#xD;
one. The latter was not blind to the ner-&#xD;
vous restlessness of the young man; but&#xD;
he had a lively idea of the crush and heat&#xD;
that awaited them at the opera, and was&#xD;
himself in no haste to face the ordeal.&#xD;
When he did set out, however, it was with&#xD;
his usual vigorous tactics of advance, and&#xD;
in those packed lobbies and passages Char-&#xD;
Icy rather exulted in his irresistible leader-&#xD;
ship. Isabella, at the feet of her recreant&#xD;
lover, was filling the air with the glorious&#xD;
melody of Robert, toi que j'aime, as they&#xD;
pressed through the crowd and caught the&#xD;
glittering spectacle of the house, - wave&#xD;
above wave of rapt faces turned to the&#xD;
stage, with only the soft ripple of myriad&#xD;
fans breaking the charm of absolute immo-&#xD;
bility. in the tumult of the enr'acte they&#xD;
&#xD;
fought their way valiantly to the box of the&#xD;
Baronne. It, too, was thronged with ex-&#xD;
travagantly dressed men, whose presence&#xD;
was singularly distasteftil to Charley. while&#xD;
their number was rather discouraging; but&#xD;
Somers effected access, and Charley fol-&#xD;
lowed resolutely on his heels, quite igno-&#xD;
rant of the puzzled and curious regards&#xD;
which met him on all sides.&#xD;
"Ah I bon soir, Monsieur Somers, and&#xD;
Mr. Wales, too, - how delightful I" She&#xD;
turned half round, and put out her hand to&#xD;
the dazzled Charley, who took it in its&#xD;
snowy glove almost timidly, and stumbled&#xD;
sadly in his words. Struggle as he would,&#xD;
the old readiness failed him before this wo-&#xD;
man, and, indeed, the rencontre with the&#xD;
rosy deity of the afternoon could scarcely&#xD;
have schooled him for the splendid creature&#xD;
now before him, in the richest of evening&#xD;
dress, with bare, white arms and shoulders,&#xD;
and diamonds flashing from breast and&#xD;
brow, - flashing blindness and delirium to&#xD;
his eye and brain.&#xD;
"Mais, Monsieur Ic Compte, a thousand&#xD;
pardons! un si vieux ami -" It was the&#xD;
Baronne' s voice in the sweetest, most be-&#xD;
seeching tones; and M. le Compte, who was&#xD;
the happy occupant of the chair behind her,&#xD;
surrendered the same in angry bewilder-&#xD;
ment to the smiling Chancy, who lost no&#xD;
time in taking possession thereof, secretly&#xD;
enchanted to find himself already an "old&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
M. le Compte withdrew in high dudgeon,&#xD;
followed soon by the others, all equally im-&#xD;
pressed with the conviction that their pres-&#xD;
ence was no longer necessary to the situa-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Who is the phenomenon, Count?"&#xD;
asked one.&#xD;
"Mule diables! how should I know !"&#xD;
responded that gentleman - a marvellous&#xD;
conserve of sixty sumiucrs - with much&#xD;
phlegm&#xD;
"0, I beg pardon!" laughed the other;&#xD;
" the grace and readiness with which you&#xD;
gave him your chair led inc to suppose -"&#xD;
"Bah! c'est trap fort! Sans doute it is&#xD;
some distinguished relative from the Bas-&#xD;
Rhone districts."&#xD;
"Very likely - to he sure."&#xD;
A single shadow clung to the name of&#xD;
Nina Choisy; and, after the manner of&#xD;
their race, these gentlemen consoled their&#xD;
wounded hearts by dwelling on and mag-&#xD;
nif~ing it.&#xD;
Our two friends, remaining masters of&#xD;
the field, settled themselves in the coveted&#xD;
places with perfect contempt of the laws of&#xD;
succession; Somers paying assiduous court&#xD;
to the smiling Grandoic, whose miraculous&#xD;
preservation as displayed in opera costume&#xD;
was the won~ler of his soul ; Charley lean-&#xD;
ing over the Baronne and drinking the deep&#xD;
&#xD;
intoxication of her backward glances, wis&#xD;
ing the mimic love-story on the stage mig&#xD;
never end. In the pretty, girlish enthu~&#xD;
asmn of the Baronne, it is probable there w&#xD;
much of the actress. Somers, who h~&#xD;
seen her yawn through the same scene mo&#xD;
than onc~, thought so, but coupled tI&#xD;
thought with approval. But upon our we&#xD;
shipping Charley there came no shadow&#xD;
suspicion; he was insensible even to tI&#xD;
most natural consideration that the beaui&#xD;
before him was and could be no other thi&#xD;
~      the schooled woman of the world, to who&#xD;
that glare of light and luxury, that wonde&#xD;
ul music even, and the listening thousand&#xD;
werethings worn and old and lifeless. fl&#xD;
never thought of that; but he exulted&#xD;
the dewy freshness of the beauty befor&#xD;
I      him, and the artless insouciance - perfe~&#xD;
tion of art- in manner and word of it&#xD;
possessor. It was this childlike innocence&#xD;
~      which charmed him, and the charm hid th&#xD;
exception. Poor boy! he worshipped pur:&#xD;
d and simplicity in a French opera-box&#xD;
n(l the Bayonne knew it all, and reveille&#xD;
the knowledge It was something cci&#xD;
fresh from his breez&#xD;
ir, standing an unsullied knight-errant a&#xD;
er chair; but there was yet a germ in he&#xD;
oman's heart that swelled into delicious&#xD;
in the presence of this surprise.&#xD;
it had seemed but a moment to Char&#xD;
rising and falling of the curtain&#xD;
y, that sweet dreamy interval of stolen&#xD;
lances and smiles and whispered words&#xD;
though it had been a whole, long, fatiguin~&#xD;
scene for the matchless Adelina, no doubt&#xD;
He hid sighed unconsciously when the veil&#xD;
f~dl, awl fancied with a lover's&#xD;
vanity that tIme Baronne had joined him in&#xD;
that sentimental expression. Certainly she&#xD;
I ~ remained pensive and silent while Charley&#xD;
~ arranged her mantle, which lie did with&#xD;
trembling hands. Something of the same&#xD;
feeling seemed to pervade the four as they&#xD;
lingered a fhw moments in the box, while&#xD;
e multitude poured out in a slow, im-&#xD;
peded stream, arid Somers broke a profound&#xD;
silence when he spoke.&#xD;
"Woe is me, Alhama! It is desolating&#xD;
to think thit this fkiry scene, which in ten&#xD;
minutes will be 'chaos and old night,' is&#xD;
but the epitome of the Paris of to-morrow.&#xD;
The world has packed its trunks ~and flies&#xD;
with the dawn, like the elfin phalanx.&#xD;
Do you go also to-morrow, Madame la&#xD;
Baronne?"&#xD;
"I believe so," she replied, listlessly. She&#xD;
stole a glance at Charley as she spoke, and&#xD;
was fairly startled by his changed face.&#xD;
N'est ce pas, maman?&#xD;
"Mais aid," responded that amiable fe-&#xD;
male with responive melancholy. She&#xD;
measured the march of time too closely not&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
h- to feel sorrow at the end of another season,&#xD;
l~t but her respect for the conventionalities&#xD;
51- was superior to every other consideration.&#xD;
as "After to-morrow, you know," she said,&#xD;
id "Paris will be quite insupportable."&#xD;
re Charley seemed paralyzed; twenty un-&#xD;
ac speakable things surged to his lips, twenty&#xD;
r- impracticable schemes flitted through his&#xD;
of brain. Going away? to-morrow? where?&#xD;
ic He would follow her! Then the flame&#xD;
by flared out and left a cold gloom. Somers&#xD;
in had set the example, and, giving his arm to&#xD;
in the Baronne, Chancy followed the others&#xD;
r- into the corridor. Neither spoke; the&#xD;
s, Baronne was waiting, and Charley could&#xD;
[e not trust his tongue. At last, as the lights&#xD;
* n grew di miner, he managed to ask timidly,&#xD;
e "Is it truc that you go away to-morrow?"&#xD;
"He/as! cci," she answered, briefly. She&#xD;
~s hung rather heavily on his arm, and looked&#xD;
e downward persistently, and there was an&#xD;
e interval of silence.&#xD;
i-   "Shall you care - very much? you, who&#xD;
I have known me but a day!"&#xD;
I The words were almost in the tone of&#xD;
v badinage, and Charley, who turned to look&#xD;
y quickly as he~ heard them, met a half-sad,&#xD;
r half-laughing face. But in her eyes was a&#xD;
t deep, serious light, - alert, questioning, in-&#xD;
r tense. Even in the shade he caught it, and&#xD;
it sobered him, checking some heated&#xD;
inspiration of the moment. When he an-&#xD;
- swered, it was soberly, but with undisguised&#xD;
feeling.&#xD;
"I shall care; I should like to know&#xD;
you better."&#xD;
"lion!" came the response on the in-&#xD;
stant; "then I will not go!"&#xD;
I They had reached the portal, and in an-&#xD;
other minute (Jhanley had handed her into&#xD;
the coupe and stood uncovered at the door.&#xD;
She gave him her hand, just an instant, as&#xD;
* he stood there, anti spoke quick and low,&#xD;
"lion soir, mon ami; i~ bieat6t!"&#xD;
Soon! it might as well have been a cen-&#xD;

CHOISY-.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
MADAME.&#xD;
THE Baronne Choisy was a star of' the&#xD;
first magnitude in the fashionable world of&#xD;
Paris. She was, indeed, more than that;&#xD;
she was a meteor, and since she had first&#xD;
flashed upon the social horizon, two years&#xD;
before, had held a pre-eminent place among&#xD;
the sisterhood of society's queens. The&#xD;
coming of the, unknown provincial beauty&#xD;
had been duly heralded by Madame (~ran-&#xD;
doie, whose acquaintance we have made.&#xD;
This lady was the widow of a dignitary of the&#xD;
last Orleans Court, and a somewhat antique&#xD;
relic of the old aristocracy of' the Chauss~e&#xD;
d'Antin. She made the most of her not very&#xD;
clear claim of ancienne noblesse, and clung to&#xD;
the boards of' the social stage with a clever&#xD;
tenaei~ty known only to a Frenehwoman,&#xD;
securing her position by a certain popu-&#xD;
larity with the younger class, for whom she&#xD;
rendered diplomatic services in a variety of&#xD;
ways; fom' trustworthy instruments of that&#xD;
character were much in demand in latter-&#xD;
day Pam'is. 'flie entree of Nina Choisy in&#xD;
the fashionable arena was a godsend to the&#xD;
worthy dame; she was a soi-disant relative,&#xD;
and had been requested by the Baronne&#xD;
to take the position of ~gis of the new&#xD;
and elegant hotel in the Avenue de Ia Reine&#xD;
Hortense. It may be imagined with what&#xD;
ecstatic joy she assented, and how felici-&#xD;
tously she trumpeted abroad the intelligence&#xD;
of Nina's coining, weeks before her arrival.&#xD;
"Such a dear child!" she cried to her&#xD;
first victim, la Comtesse Brie'; " she is so&#xD;
lovely, and so fine. She was here a long&#xD;
time, you know, at the pension Gaspard,&#xD;
and would always escape and come to me,&#xD;
poor child! She could not bear the re-&#xD;
straint. Ah ! the ingenious illnesses we&#xD;
invented to gain holidays; they were su-&#xD;
perb. La paucre che'rie! Monsieur le Baron,&#xD;
you know, is imbecile, and the poor, dear&#xD;
Colonel, her father, was killed in the hunt.&#xD;
Fancy the life for the darling in that heart-&#xD;
breaking wilderness! Me, I was writing&#xD;
her forever to come to Paris, and voil~! she&#xD;
comes. She will capture all the hearts.&#xD;
Ah! les beaux yeux! I go to tell Madame,&#xD;
Monsieur le Compte, that she must keep&#xD;
you un(ler the good guard when my ravish-&#xD;
in~ prot6qee arrives!"&#xD;
~Ionsieur le Compte laughed lightly, but&#xD;
he had been all ears, and, after seeing&#xD;
Madame Grnndoie to her carriage, he saun-&#xD;
tered off to the Jockey Club with his news,&#xD;
and retailed the same in epigrammatic style&#xD;
to a circle of acquaintances which fringed&#xD;
an indolent pai'ty at e'carte'. "Prodigy en&#xD;
route fm'om the districts; projected eclipse&#xD;
of all the fixed stars and movable planets&#xD;
generally in the social ~vom Id!"&#xD;
"Mon Dien, Count, - go the Academy&#xD;
&#xD;
MADAME.&#xD;
&#xD;
with your convulsions of nature, and leave&#xD;
us in peace," cried a player.&#xD;
"He has pillaged the secrets of the astro-&#xD;
nomical genius in the Place VendOmne!"&#xD;
"Spare us the homily of the Piciades, 0&#xD;
Count ! the lost, the fallemi -&#xD;
"JAah! it 's only a woman;&#xD;
see?"                         don't you&#xD;
Tiens! I thought it was a comet!"&#xD;
"From where, did you say?"&#xD;
"'Paris, Lyon et Meditcrran~e,' "laughed&#xD;
the Count, rallying from the cross-fire his&#xD;
original remark had drawn upon him.&#xD;
"Bah! the marrans are not in season, my&#xD;
good man!"&#xD;
"A toute sauce, mon cher, so the filet is&#xD;
prime !&#xD;
"Hearken to the beast ! I mark the&#xD;
king. You don't tell us xxho it is."&#xD;
"Baronne Choisy, - you know the name;&#xD;
owned all Lyons once, and may yet, for&#xD;
aught 1 know."&#xD;
Dead, is n't he, the Baron ? " asked&#xD;
some one.&#xD;
"No, but un peu pres, I judge, nothing&#xD;
left but his stomach !&#xD;
"Great Epicurus! nothing but stomach!&#xD;
Baron Choisy, mats blessed of the gods!"&#xD;
"Are you quite correct in the name,&#xD;
Monsieur le Compte?" inquired a withered,&#xD;
painfully preserved old gent fi-om his chair,&#xD;
- one of those immeasurably antique relics&#xD;
of society which abound in Paris.&#xD;
"Monsieur l'Ombi'e, I speak from the&#xD;
cards," responded the Count with a bow,&#xD;
while the whole circle turned with instinc-&#xD;
tive expectation toward the "shade." Nor&#xD;
did he disappoint them ; he filled the office&#xD;
of his class with singular fidelity, arid could&#xD;
disinter the buried histories of half the old&#xD;
families of France at reasonable notice.&#xD;
But he chose at the opening to be distress-&#xD;
ingly succinct. "I knew her as a child;&#xD;
served with her Thtber, Colonel d'Alen-&#xD;
court in Afiica - flue nian - killed himself&#xD;
hunting two years ago - made an odd mar-&#xD;
riage - peasant-woman or ~omcthimmg - uf-&#xD;

some, but un pert' brute - after her mother&#xD;
probably."&#xD;
The listening gentlemen were not to be&#xD;
put off with these staccato details.&#xD;
"How do you say?" asked the Count&#xD;
Bri~, drawing nearer, and offering his jew-&#xD;
elled snuff-box to the veteran, while the&#xD;
others gathered quietly about, "peasant-&#xD;
woina~? a nme~saiiance then?"&#xD;
Monsieur l'Ombre preserved an exterior&#xD;
of solemn indifference, but was secretly very&#xD;
vain of the attention he received; the&#xD;
amour propre of an octogenarian is the&#xD;
essence of his existence in wb;mtever direc-&#xD;
tion it may tum'n, and the venerable "Jock-&#xD;

CHOISY.&#xD;
&#xD;
quired; but some grave contingency arose&#xD;
which had the remarkable effect of bring-&#xD;
ing the old Baron in desperation to the&#xD;
astonished Colonel with a proposal for the&#xD;
immediate alliance of their offspring. The&#xD;
paysanne-m~re was ignored, nor was the&#xD;
young man's character discussed; only the&#xD;
message went to Paris, and Nina was&#xD;
brought home to take for her husband the&#xD;
Beast. This passage of her life may well&#xD;
be curtained from view; it was such a mad,&#xD;
despairing struggle of the woman's heart as&#xD;
we should only shudder to read of, and we&#xD;
might err in reading it, and pity her. There&#xD;
was no escape; none but the one that even&#xD;
frenzy shrinks from, though she thought of&#xD;
it more than once. But imer strength re-&#xD;
fused it, and she was strong. Who knows?&#xD;
The old Roman blood ran in her veins, as&#xD;
it had come down warm and unsullied&#xD;
through the ages to the woman of ArIes, -&#xD;
the blood it might be of a Lucretia, as&#xD;
Count Brid had said in jest; burning for&#xD;
good or evil, but burning fierce and strong.&#xD;
Must she wed with this stained brute?&#xD;
There was an alternative, it was not sodiffi-&#xD;
cult to secure, - she was so young, so beau-&#xD;
tiful, so resistless in her intuitive coquetry!&#xD;
With a sort of mad ingenuity she grasped&#xD;
her fate and steeled her heart to the sacri-&#xD;
fice, and the world opened its sleepy eyes,&#xD;
and laughed brutally at the diplomacy of&#xD;
the school-girl, when it was known that she&#xD;
had married the old Baron and left the&#xD;
Beast to curse upon the doorstep.&#xD;
A personage who had been a silent mem-&#xD;
ber of the company which surrounded the&#xD;
veracious L'Ombre was especially interested&#xD;
in that gentleman's account of the Baronne&#xD;
Choisy, and afterwards went to considerable&#xD;
trouble among divers old memoranda in the&#xD;
evening seclusion of his own chamber, the&#xD;
result of which investigation was something&#xD;
like a grunt of ~atisfacsion, the indolent ex-&#xD;
tension of two colossal legs over an adja-&#xD;
cent chair, and a soliloquy to this effect:&#xD;
"Same party, as I fancied, - Flo's old&#xD;
arnie at Madame Gaspard's. Nina d'Alen-&#xD;
court, - pretty name! Peasant-mother,&#xD;
humph I - sick man - half of Lyons I -&#xD;
must look in there for old acquaintance, -&#xD;
'should old acquaintance be forgot?"'&#xD;
And with these last words feebly indi-&#xD;
cating a musical intention, our worthy&#xD;
friend, Monsieur Somers, at whom we are&#xD;
taking a glance some two years previous to&#xD;
the date of our story, drowsed off comfort-&#xD;
ably on his impromptu couch.&#xD;
Nina Choisy had been married three&#xD;
years when she burst upon the world at&#xD;
Paris. Tragic events had marked the time&#xD;
for her in congenial unison with the angry&#xD;
tempest in her soul. From the very day of&#xD;
his marriage the Baron, like the rash priest&#xD;
of the temple, who wooed the goddess, sank&#xD;
&#xD;
into a mumbling oblivion; the wretched&#xD;
profligate son cut short his career by his&#xD;
own insane hand; and her father, the Colo-&#xD;
nel, had killed himself in the chase. She&#xD;
was little moved by this series of fatalities.&#xD;
She only breathed more freely after them,&#xD;
and planned a future of her own, hugging&#xD;
each day more passionately the old girl-&#xD;
dream, shapeless, intangible, but living,-&#xD;
a shadow of the ideal. A strange charac-&#xD;
ter was formed in this woman, or, better, a&#xD;
character strangely deformed. Crushed,&#xD;
sacrificed as she was, with all the maiden&#xD;
whiteness blotted from her soul; reckless,&#xD;
and ready for any means to gain her end, -&#xD;
that end was still the old, sweet desire of&#xD;
her best days; the haunting vision of a&#xD;
love, pure, perfect, stainless, and all her&#xD;
own. She was one of a class; and can we&#xD;
not fancy how Judith and Beatrice and&#xD;
Charlotte Corday would have loved?&#xD;
Her entree at Paris was a triumph. The&#xD;
gay coterie gathered in idle curiosity ad-&#xD;
mired, wondered, and lingered in a spell.&#xD;
The men found something in her that was&#xD;
not to be explained, but which thrilled and&#xD;
held them captive al her feet; and some,&#xD;
who had built their pretty schemes on the&#xD;
fancied assailability of the provincial wife,&#xD;
were left to puzzle over the well-poised&#xD;
woman of the world, who stepped from the&#xD;
shadows of the distant chateau, like Palms&#xD;
from the brain of Jove, armed and equipped&#xD;
for the strife. It was an ordeal of fire, raging&#xD;
and fierce, that she had to pass; but she&#xD;
came through it bravely and unscathed,&#xD;
and her first season left her victorious and&#xD;
triumphant, a reine du monde, of whom&#xD;
Paris spoke in admiration and, what was&#xD;
rarer, with respect. She formed naturally&#xD;
her circle of chosen friends, and among&#xD;
these figured no less a dignitary than our&#xD;
giant of memoranda and dreams, M. Som-&#xD;
ers.&#xD;
I have said that he was a handsome and&#xD;
attractive man, and the reader has, perhaps,&#xD;
divined that he could be pleasant and win-&#xD;
ning in his way. I may add now that he&#xD;
possessed the additional advantage of good&#xD;
family, and held unquestioned position at&#xD;
Paris as an independent and reputable gen-&#xD;
tleman. Not a few of his countrymen made&#xD;
their home in the French capital in those&#xD;
days, many of them of high caste, and their&#xD;
society was much courted in that peculiarly&#xD;
mixed aristocracy where the title was not&#xD;
always strengthened with age, or even sup-&#xD;
ported by attest, and where the genuine&#xD;
article had an exaggerated value. Edward&#xD;
Somers, albeit not of actual blue-blood ex-&#xD;
traction, hailed from an eligible environ of&#xD;
May Fair. His elder brother had been&#xD;
knighted for distinguished services in her&#xD;
Majesty's Parliament, and the family was&#xD;
an old and wealthy one. There were peo-&#xD;
&#xD;

4&#xD;

4&#xD;
4&#xD;
10&#xD;
4&#xD;
4&#xD;
4&#xD;
I&#xD;
4&#xD;
4&#xD;
4&#xD;
4&#xD;
4&#xD;
4&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
pIe, indeed, of that impracticable class&#xD;
which afflicts all lands and races, who hinted&#xD;
at unpleasant passages in Mr. Somers's lifi~&#xD;
of long anterior date, and the whisper was&#xD;
heard, and perhaps remembered, but had&#xD;
never brought any damage to the subject&#xD;
thereof. Englishmen, visiting Englishmen,&#xD;
as a rule, "did not know" Mr. Somers.&#xD;
"Brother to Sir Robert? Awl indeed, was&#xD;
not aware Sir Robert had a brother; un-&#xD;
fortunate estrangement, perhaps." Where-&#xD;
upon Mr. Edward would be dropped with&#xD;
no particular d:smage to himself. He was&#xD;
not extravagant in his living, and made no&#xD;
debts, at least none that could be talked&#xD;
about, and he was very clever in sporting&#xD;
matters, and immensely popular at the&#xD;
Jockey Club. He was scarcely less popu-&#xD;
lar in the social world, where there lacked&#xD;
no smiles for thu splendid lion d'Angleterre,&#xD;
as he was not infrequently called; and he&#xD;
had experienced no difficulty in obtaining&#xD;
the entire at the Hotel Choisy.&#xD;
For the rest, it would scarcely have been&#xD;
our Monsieur Somers had he failed to push&#xD;
his way into pleasant friendliness with the&#xD;
Baronne. Of course, she "remembered the&#xD;
darling Florence, - was she married? - and&#xD;
she was so pleased to know her brother;&#xD;
now that she recalled his sister's face more&#xD;
clearly, there was much resemblance." And&#xD;
he was charme(l, as all had been befot'e him,&#xD;
and as all continued to be who came after.&#xD;
He was not without certain pretensions of&#xD;
his own as a man of conquests, moreover,&#xD;
and in his secret soul there had ever lin-&#xD;
gered a consoling faith in events which&#xD;
were, some bright day, destined to conduct&#xD;
his aimless bark into a haven of affluence&#xD;
and ease. More than once had the possible&#xD;
agent of this delightful consummation taken&#xD;
shape in the person of some new fair one&#xD;
dawning on the horizon of his acquaintance;&#xD;
and though doomed to repeated disappoint-&#xD;
ment, the hope burned brightly to the last&#xD;
upon the altar of his heart. It blazed into&#xD;
a more brilliant glow than ever when he en-&#xD;
countered the Baronne, but never was the&#xD;
illusion so short-lived ; his passion subsided&#xD;
instantly again to the sober warmth of trust&#xD;
and expectation: for h~was very wise and&#xD;
quick-sighted, ~vas Edward Somers, possess-&#xD;
ing an alert faculty under the free and I&#xD;
lightsome exterior that the world reeked&#xD;
not of, and his wisdom lent him eyes. He&#xD;
was very devoted to the Baronne, and she&#xD;
grew to like him immensely, called him her I&#xD;
Hercule soumis, and enrolled him among&#xD;
the privileged souls who enjoyed a certain&#xD;
intimacy at the now famous hotel in the&#xD;
Avenue de Ia Remne Ilortense.&#xD;
Once, at one of those delightful dejeuners&#xD;
iflhimes at which Somers was a favored par-&#xD;
ticipator, there occurred an incident. The I&#xD;
Occasion was marked by the introduction ~&#xD;
&#xD;
MADAME.                        61&#xD;
&#xD;
of a new assailant upon the arena where so&#xD;
many had contested for the high prize of the&#xD;
Baronne's smiles. This was a nobleman of&#xD;
certain celebrity; they called him Camours&#xD;
at the clubs, though we have heard him&#xD;
addressed by his correct name by Count&#xD;
Brid, some pages back. He came at the&#xD;
eleventh hour, like the tardy knight in ro-&#xD;
mance who enters the lists when the read-&#xD;
er's patience is at the ebb; he was the last&#xD;
of the irresistiblees" and Somers watched&#xD;
the encounter closely. He saw the Ba-&#xD;
ronne's eye take rapid measure of the man;&#xD;
it was just one quick, flashing glance,&#xD;
questioning, critical, infallible; but what&#xD;
another might not have seen Somers saw, a&#xD;
vague, far-away shade of expectancy, al-&#xD;
most of longing, followed by the droop of&#xD;
disappointment, - the look of one who seeks&#xD;
a lost face iii a throng of faces and cannot&#xD;
tln(l it. Scores, almost hundreds of times,&#xD;
he had caught that momentary expression;&#xD;
he had even seen it pass over her face at&#xD;
his own presentation to her, and in tiniQ he&#xD;
had mastered the thought beneath it.&#xD;
He was standing by her alone later that&#xD;
morning, when the party, which was quite&#xD;
numerous, bad returned to the drawing-room.&#xD;
'fbey were at an Ol)Cfl window, where the&#xD;
early roses strayed in at their feet, and she&#xD;
was teasing the miniature terrier, pushing&#xD;
him in amon~ the thorns as often as he&#xD;
struo'rrlcd out et submission to lick&#xD;
the tiny foot that wrought his woes. There&#xD;
had been a season of silence, broken only&#xD;
by her fits of merry laughter at the unhappy&#xD;
dog, until Somers spoke in a low, peculiar&#xD;
tone, 'Another, -and not he!" The little&#xD;
foot paused half-way in its campaign against&#xD;
the terrier, and she looked up, puzzlemi and&#xD;
startled, with the faintest possible flush on&#xD;
her face; the bi~ blu&#xD;
smihin~r met here' e eyes, half sad, half&#xD;
own, and he added in the&#xD;
same tone, "Mcii em~/in! couraqe! He is&#xD;
in the world, and he will come!"&#xD;
She looked away into the garden an in-&#xD;
s~tant, and felt how little she knew this great&#xD;
woman-faced man with his surface-manner&#xD;
of unconscious bonhomie and all that subtle-&#xD;
ty below. But she liked him; there was&#xD;
such an atmosphere of strength and protec-&#xD;
tion about him, and she hoped he could be&#xD;
~ood as she believed him, to be a gentleman&#xD;
and somehow, it disturbed her very little to&#xD;
Find he had read her secret. The hesi-&#xD;
bation was only momentary; she caught&#xD;
[mis hand and pressed it, an(l smile(l in his&#xD;
~yes, like a tiustin~g girl. How marvelously&#xD;
roung she kept that face l&#xD;
"Allons! mon ami, we shall always be&#xD;
uch good friends, - n'est ce pci?"&#xD;
Then she ran away and joine(l her com-&#xD;
rnny, while the man, who of all men in&#xD;
B'aris at that moment was the best satisfied&#xD;

smiled on the vernal scene without. It may&#xD;
be added that 1mb conduct that evening in&#xD;
the privacy of his chamber was the reverse&#xD;
of that which we noted on a previous soin-&#xD;
nolent occasion; it verged, in fret, on the&#xD;
acrobatic, - so closely, indeed, that a gentle-&#xD;
man of sedate and studious turn of mnind,&#xD;
who occupied apartments directly below&#xD;
those of Mr. Somers, abandoned time mid-&#xD;
night lanip in despair, and, being of disposi-&#xD;
tion averse to complaint, sought, rather, to&#xD;
escape tIme infliction by a promenade upon&#xD;
the Boulevards at an hour when for gentle-&#xD;
men of setlate and respectable character&#xD;
that glittering thoroughfare was one en-&#xD;
vironed by manifold perils.&#xD;
From that (lay it was noticed that the&#xD;
Baronne accorded a certain delicate famil-&#xD;
iarity to her blond hercules, who knew its&#xD;
value and guarded it accordingly; and it&#xD;
was no deti-inment to Monsieur Somers in his&#xD;
world of acquaintance to have gained the&#xD;
recognized title to something like a brother-&#xD;
ly privilege at the Hotel Choisy.&#xD;
Nina's secon(l season was, if possible, more&#xD;
brilliant than her first; she was more fasci-&#xD;
nating, lovelier, and more unapproachable&#xD;
than before: and the men raved, while time&#xD;
women applauded, and each with an equal,&#xD;
though secret bitterness. Somers was glo-&#xD;
rifled, and held his post with the spotless&#xD;
fidelity of the Pompeiian, revelling in his&#xD;
privileges, m~nd watching anxiously and un-&#xD;
easily for that "coming man." But the&#xD;
great myth, the ideal, came not and&#xD;
while our noble guardsman rejoiced, Nina,&#xD;
in her soul, lost much of the wild, unspoken&#xD;
hope which had so long animated and sus-&#xD;
tained her. She grew very weary with the&#xD;
long wimiter of ceastiess and unmeaning&#xD;
gayety, and hailed the semi-repose of the&#xD;
Lenten days with a sigh of relief: She had&#xD;
coveted this restless life, not so much for&#xD;
any charm of its own, but as the vantage-&#xD;
ground whereon her life-scheme might&#xD;
achieve its dear result. She met its perils,&#xD;
breathed its poisons, and shared its strug-&#xD;
gles with imidifferenee; but it wearied her&#xD;
in the en(l, an(l it had bruised her some-&#xD;
times so that now slme loved it not, and re-&#xD;
proached it for the disappointments it had&#xD;
borne her. The color was slowly fading,&#xD;
too, from that old, never-to-be-realized&#xD;
dream.&#xD;
"Dites-moi, Hercule," she cried, leaning&#xD;
her chin on her hands and looking vexed,&#xD;
half desperate, but more beautiful in her&#xD;
impatient abandon than ever a graceless&#xD;
daughter of earth had looked before; "on&#xD;
done est mon Ulysse?"&#xD;
Somers was omily human; with all his&#xD;
easy control he was often enough near play-&#xD;
ing the lbol with this siren, and he was&#xD;
never nearer than on this occasion. But&#xD;
he checked himself bravely, and answered&#xD;
&#xD;
in mock-melancholy, "Helas! madame, if&#xD;
it is to be Ulysses! The poor man was&#xD;
twenty years en route!"&#xD;
"Mon Dieu! Merci - la pauvre Penelo-&#xD;
pe! Me, I abandon Ulysses; he is mag-&#xD;
nificent, tacit ii coyage ~si doucement!&#xD;
The spring passed away, and Nina still&#xD;
lingered at Paris. Never had she so dread-&#xD;
ed and shrunk from the return to the cha-&#xD;
teau, and there were not lacking pleading&#xD;
voices to persuade her to remain in the&#xD;
gay city. So she stayed even to the close,&#xD;
fixing her departure for the day following&#xD;
the Grand P-ix. it was almost by accident&#xD;
that she had done this, as it was by acci-&#xD;
dent that from her carriage she had noted&#xD;
the new face by Somers's shoulder, and&#xD;
flashed surprise and confusion on it with her&#xD;
wonderful gray eyes. It had not precisely&#xD;
charmed her on the spot, this young hand-&#xD;
some face of our Chai-ley; but she liked it,&#xD;
and found time, amid all the demands upon&#xD;
her attention, to give the order to Somers&#xD;
that we heard.&#xD;
When she had seen him, looked him&#xD;
through and through, and read him as she&#xD;
could so easily do, she liked 1dm better.&#xD;
Indeed, the fever that possessed the young&#xD;
man called forth something like an answer-&#xD;
ing flush in the woman's hca-t; it had&#xD;
stolen in silently and insidiously, and she&#xD;
never knew it till it was there. Then she&#xD;
grasped the thought, and hugged it with the&#xD;
fist strength of a passion that might grow&#xD;
into delirium. He was only a boy; there&#xD;
were moments ~vhen she would have called&#xD;
him a child; but there was the unbroken&#xD;
bloom of his young manhood upon him, cool&#xD;
and fresh as water from tIme spring to her&#xD;
thirsting heart. It was a-cry sweet to turn&#xD;
from that exotic life with its heated, arid&#xD;
glow and sickly odors, its false flowers and&#xD;
flilser faces, and revel in the new, the al-&#xD;
most unknown, atmosphere that clung about&#xD;
his glorious youth, to read truth and feeling&#xD;
undisguised in his face, to see a fiist strong&#xD;
passion gathering in the lion's C) cal Was&#xD;
it her dream? She could not remember&#xD;
what she had dreamed; she was conscious&#xD;
only of the long-coming fire in her blood,&#xD;
and the tardy illumination of that shaded&#xD;
corner of her heart, and she was supi-emely&#xD;
content.&#xD;
And he had known her, site had known&#xD;
him, but a day l&#xD;

CHOISY.&#xD;
&#xD;
recognized "Monsieur le Compte" of the&#xD;
opera-box.&#xD;
Somers signalled him at the moment, and&#xD;
the two friends met in the hall.&#xD;
"What a jam I" cried the Bohemian.&#xD;
"I could n't get a word with the Baronne;&#xD;
but I saw the 'evergreen'" (such was his&#xD;
irreverent designation of Madame Gr4n-&#xD;
doic), "and it seems she is not going away&#xD;
immediately."&#xD;
"I believe not," returned Charley, dryly.&#xD;
"The gods be praised!" echoed Somers,&#xD;
who, if he noticed the young man's manner,&#xD;
evidently bore no i resentment. "What&#xD;
shall we do till dinner-time?"&#xD;
"I am indifferent; something quiet.&#xD;
Let 's drive."&#xD;
"Ban! we might look in, though, at the&#xD;
salon, - the art exhibition, you knbw, at the&#xD;
Palais de l'Industrie. There 's an acre or&#xD;
two of nude studies; an unusual number,&#xD;
and it has given rise to a curious whisper in&#xD;
the city which says they are portraits, the&#xD;
last freak of haul tan. It is tedious, how-&#xD;
ever, and there 's nothing else there; a&#xD;
drive be it."&#xD;
They coursed out the Champs and looked&#xD;
in a moment at the Hippodrome, where a&#xD;
blooming bevy of gini-jockies were riding&#xD;
absurd raee&amp;amp; on bicycles, after which they&#xD;
made a turn in the Wood, emerging at the&#xD;
Porte Maillot. It was an entertaining round,&#xD;
but Charley sat through it in dreamy si-&#xD;
lence, smoking innumerable cigars and&#xD;
drinking his glass of beer at the Cascade in&#xD;
blissful ignorance of its inferiority. His&#xD;
preoccupation was not unobserved by his&#xD;
companion, who smiled to himself and re-&#xD;
spectemi it; and it was with a start that&#xD;
Chamley awoke at the gate in the twilight,&#xD;
where they got out and went in to dine&#xD;
fuori le mura.&#xD;
Strolling down the Capucines, later,&#xD;
Charley stopped at one of the pretty flower-&#xD;
shops and or(lered a bouquet forwarded to&#xD;
the Hotel Choisy~ overwhelming the smiling&#xD;
Ceres with a hundred-franc note.&#xD;
"Alan Dieu! merci bica, monsieur! It is&#xD;
a great price. I will do my possible - un&#xD;
grand jali panier dora, with the camellia, the&#xD;
jasmine, les tub6-euses, les flours d'arange. I&#xD;
trust, monsieur, he will he pleased."&#xD;
"By Jove! my nmagtnjlco, there will be a&#xD;
feast in Clichy to-night, and your health&#xD;
drunk a mile deep in great flagons of Bar-&#xD;
delais! Will you comae down to the club?&#xD;
I must look in there a moment."&#xD;
Charley begged off, and sought his quar-&#xD;
ters; lie could brook no distraction from his&#xD;
fond thoughts. The rosy concierge met&#xD;
him in the court with an air of great mys-&#xD;
tery and importance, and slipped a tiny note&#xD;
in his hand, which he took breathlessly, and&#xD;
sped up stairs, madame of the candles&#xD;
smiling after him approvingly. The mis-&#xD;
&#xD;
sive was a crested one, and had come in&#xD;
due state, borne by no less a personage than&#xD;
a livened marvel of silence and discretion;&#xD;
and that was as it should be. Madame was&#xD;
a reader of Dumas, - qui sait? the court&#xD;
itself might have its quota of distressed&#xD;
beauty, as in days of old, and cc cher Man-&#xD;
sicur Vales, - was he not a D'Artagnan?&#xD;
Charley devoured the note with hungry&#xD;
eyes in the solitude of his chamber; it was&#xD;
not a lengthy feast, -&#xD;
"The good Hercules will have affaires,&#xD;
sans doute, to-morrow, at three!" was all&#xD;
it said, and an airy "N" was its signature.&#xD;
It need scarcely ha~e puzzled our Cliarley;&#xD;
the obscurity of lovers' messages should be&#xD;
as radiant daylight to lovers' eyes, read as&#xD;
they may to the unconcerned. W therefore,&#xD;
then, did the youth read it a score of times?&#xD;
wherefore, indeed, after putting it away&#xD;
jealously in isis bosom-pocket, and flinging&#xD;
himself upon a sofa to dream sweet dreams,&#xD;
must he needs start upright again, ravish it&#xD;
from its hiding-place, and read it half a&#xD;
score times more? The gentle, sympa-&#xD;
thetic reader can solve the problem perhaps&#xD;
better than I could.&#xD;
When Somers came in later, he found&#xD;
the youth stretched out in luxurious aban-&#xD;
don on the sofa, encase(l in a crimson dress-&#xD;
ing.gown, an~l fairly floating in smoke; the&#xD;
effect by gaslight was highly dramatic.&#xD;
"Diable des ~Etnas! how you sons of&#xD;
freedom do smoke!" cried Somers, divest-&#xD;
ing himself of his coat, and regarding&#xD;
Charley with serious eyes; "your daily&#xD;
portion of tobacco would shake me up,&#xD;
Charley, and I 'm no chicken. I must look&#xD;
after you, you know, - vans voila garde'!"&#xD;
The speaker busied himself the while at&#xD;
the sideboard, which particular feature of&#xD;
their mae'image, he had taken good care to&#xD;
have a model of its kind. He got out&#xD;
glasses and water and a mystic caraft, small&#xD;
in size but ominous in appearance, from&#xD;
which he poured a clear, greenish liquor&#xD;
into the two goblets, and by gradual and&#xD;
regulated additions of water transformed&#xD;
the whole into a milky, misty niixture that&#xD;
curled and wreathed itself like the genii-&#xD;
smoke. Charley watched the process with&#xD;
lazy eyes, and thought of Joe Jefferson&#xD;
"~mixing cobblers" at Laura's Keene's be-&#xD;
fore "Schneider" was "mein tog" by a&#xD;
handful of years.&#xD;
"What the deuce is that?" he asked.&#xD;
"The undiscovered elixir, my boy, what&#xD;

vexed tone, "and all my fimmily history in&#xD;

When Charley, punctual to the moment,&#xD;
as may be imagined, presented himself at&#xD;
the Baronne's, he was received with marked&#xD;
empressement by a venerable gentleman in&#xD;
house livery, who returned to him in the&#xD;
drawing-room after delivering his card, and&#xD;
begged that monsieur would follow him up&#xD;
~stairs. It was only to what in French par-&#xD;
lance is the "first story"; the ls6tel did not&#xD;
boast an entresol, and the Baronne herself&#xD;
met him at the stair landing and ushered&#xD;
.him into the broad doors of an upper salon.&#xD;
"Ban jour! Mr. Wales, you will pardon,&#xD;

as he followed her with a 'beating heart;&#xD;

pointments, and the latter in a dress of&#xD;
snowy muslin turned up at the wni4s with&#xD;
long, pointed cuffs, and down at the neck&#xD;
&#xD;
with a wide sailor-boy collar, was too&#xD;
charming for criticism. It was an odd cos-&#xD;
tume, odd for her in its girlish simplicity,&#xD;
and she had laughed gayly that morning as&#xD;
she buttoned on her cuiTh before time mirror&#xD;
at the petite pensioonaire, and grown sud-&#xD;
denly sober, afterwards, to see how little&#xD;
changed in all the years was time Nina&#xD;
tl'Alencourt of' Madame Gaspard's. Ah,&#xD;
the subtlety of a wolimami's dress ! Nina had&#xD;
not paused to definee the impulse which gov-&#xD;
erned her choice that day, anti sent hen&#xD;
back to the winsome school-girl, all inno-&#xD;
cence and momnanee ~mnd tlrcamns, of' six years&#xD;
agone. If it had seemed to her something&#xD;
of' a disguise, she overshot mIme mark, for it&#xD;
pleased without blinding time e~ es for which&#xD;
it was intentled. A trace only of the regal&#xD;
woman of the opera appeared where the&#xD;
cuff clasped time wrist an(l where the wide&#xD;
collar dipped in front anti showed a little&#xD;
chain, circling tIme full thin-oat like a thread&#xD;
of gold, and supporting some treasured talis-&#xD;
man on her heart (lie wondered with a&#xD;
little jealous spasm what it might he) ; but&#xD;
he saw the " form wimhiimi " alt the sanme&#xD;
the smooth, bare shoulders and the snowy&#xD;
neck and breast with its burden of flashing&#xD;
jewels, as he had seen it that night in lien&#xD;
box at the Itahien; and it was thins he should&#xD;
even remember hem-, cs in soiiie one dress&#xD;

wonderfully pleased with lien, though in&#xD;
this guise; he had never felt so little g&amp;amp;me'&#xD;
by her superb beauty; and as she tumbled&#xD;
the unhappy Tutu on his back in lien pretty&#xD;
childish impatience, and flashed lien white&#xD;
foot before his eyes, encased but uncovered&#xD;
in the how-cut graceful slipper of the day,&#xD;
the impulse was strong within him to catch&#xD;
hen up hike a child amid toss her to his lips.&#xD;
But he only looked sympathetic, and was&#xD;
"desolated" to learn she was "not her-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
0, 1 'm not ill," she said, petulantly,&#xD;
and then paused to add in a hmalf~mnelan-&#xD;
chohy tone, "though I often wish I might&#xD;
be, just fbr time change. I am glad yomm&#xD;
came. I want sonme one to talk to death&#xD;
this afternoon, some one sympathizing amid&#xD;

"By you? Life has no charm beside&#xD;
such a fate, madatrie!" cried Charley, gal-&#xD;
lantly, though with too much feeling for a&#xD;
gallant.&#xD;
"Ah! Mr. Wales, you, too, speak the&#xD;
language of the world when you like. If I&#xD;
measured you by that speech I would not&#xD;
have you in my sanetmun to-day. Venez!&#xD;

Her laugh stopped him, and made him un- low! how easy she found it to play with him!&#xD;

duolsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
his eye, and then held it like a magnet with&#xD;
her own, earnest, softened, almost tearful.&#xD;
"You were very quick to resent my&#xD;
words, Mr. Wales," she said, sadly, in Eng-&#xD;
lish, "and they were those of a poor, fool-&#xD;
ish wpman to a strong man. Have you an&#xD;
idea, I wonder, of what words 1 have had to&#xD;
listen to and smile, and bear my humilia-&#xD;
tion, here, under my own roof, thousands,&#xD;
I had almost said millions, of times?"&#xD;
Charley looked at her with a great throb&#xD;
of remorse; lie tried to say something, but&#xD;
succeeded only in uttering a word, "Ma-&#xD;
dame-"&#xD;
"I wonder also," she continued in the&#xD;
same weary tone, "if you have any concep-&#xD;
tion of the lives we lead, - for I am only&#xD;
one of a class, Mr. Wales, - of the life I&#xD;
have led, must lead to the hitter end ~?"&#xD;
She paused then, and Charley said, hum-&#xD;
bly, "I know little of Continental life, ma-&#xD;
dame, - nothing, you may say; but what&#xD;
you tell me seems incredible. In our coun-&#xD;
try it could not be. May I ask your pardon&#xD;
for my haste?"&#xD;
"You good child! Did you suppose I&#xD;
cared for it?" She was leaning her face on&#xD;
her hand now, and looking at him with a&#xD;
sweet sadness. "In your country all is free&#xD;
and beautiful, and a woman's burdens, if&#xD;
burdens they be, are of her own choosing.&#xD;
Do your women appreciate their condition,&#xD;
Mr. XValcs ? ".&#xD;
He smiled at the thoughts the question&#xD;
suggested.&#xD;
"Ah! you smile, and I read your thought;&#xD;
but would they change their state for ours?&#xD;
I think not, though I have known some of&#xD;
your fair countrywomen to come here and&#xD;
make marriages, which is droll."&#xD;
She shrugged her shoulders at the idea,&#xD;
and there was a little pause.&#xD;
"You have never heard, you know&#xD;
nothing of my life, Mr. Wales?"&#xD;
The question was rather direct, and he&#xD;
was confused by the reflection how little he&#xD;
did know.&#xD;
"Nothing, madame; I have no acquaint-&#xD;
ance, no opportunities; I am here since so&#xD;
short a time," he stammered, and then took&#xD;
courage and added quickly, "why need I,&#xD;
madame? I know that you are beautiful&#xD;
and good, very good to me, and I -"&#xD;
"You would die for me, would you not?"&#xD;
she put in mischievously, but with a glow&#xD;
on her face that his sudden show of feeling&#xD;
had called up. He saw the last and ig-&#xD;
nored the tone.&#xD;
"There may be that iti life which would&#xD;
make death dearer than life."&#xD;
"And that which would make life more&#xD;
terrible than death," she responded, in a&#xD;
tone as full of feeling as his own. "1 have&#xD;
known that; some day when we are the&#xD;
very, very good friends I hope we may be,&#xD;
&#xD;
69&#xD;
&#xD;
I shall tell you about my life, and you will&#xD;
pity me, perhaps, and like me none the less&#xD;
because I am less good than you had be-&#xD;
lieved. I have never had a friend, Mr.&#xD;
Wales, in all my life, - scores in name, but&#xD;
none in deed, - though poor Hercules would&#xD;
weep to hear me say it. You know what I&#xD;
mean?"&#xD;
"I can fancy it; a friend is rarer than&#xD;
the world allows. I have but one. He will&#xD;
he blessed indeed who shall claim the name&#xD;
from you."&#xD;
"I shall he blessed in finding him. Tell&#xD;
me, - I have never thought to ask you,&#xD;
how old are you, Mr. Wales Y"&#xD;
Vingi-sept," laughed Charley.&#xD;
"'Rouge, impair, a passe,'" she laughed&#xD;
back to his uncomprehending ears. "I did&#xD;
not think you so old. Tenez! I should be as-&#xD;
tonished when I think of it. Why, I am&#xD;
embarrassed, Mr. Wales; I thought you&#xD;
were mimy junior!"&#xD;
"If 1 might hope it would give me a grace&#xD;
in your eyes - Ah! madame," he ad (led,&#xD;
catching her sudden gayety, "let it not be&#xD;
remembered against me; I was happier to&#xD;
be-"&#xD;
"'The good child,' n'est ce paz?" she said&#xD;
as he hesitated. "Enfant! No, Mr. ~Vales,&#xD;
- and there 's a lesson for you, - no wo-&#xD;
man ever gave her heart entirely to a youn-&#xD;
ger than herself~"&#xD;
A sweet lesson and an apt scholar.&#xD;
"Then shall I assume my new powers,"&#xD;
cried Charley, blazing at her with his Isuob-&#xD;
ino~ e  ~b as               .      b&#xD;
~ yes, your reverend senior&#xD;
"No, no! I won't be ruled. Don't at-&#xD;
tempt it!" she cried back; "I am untam-&#xD;
able, Mr. Wales."&#xD;
" .1 think not."&#xD;
" ('jell how cool he is! How should I&#xD;
be tamed, monsieur?"&#xD;
How indeed! the question took a myriad&#xD;
forms in lip and eye and gesture.&#xD;
"By a tender hand, as nature's fiercest&#xD;
spirits are. Omme need only not to be afraid&#xD;
of you."&#xD;
"Mon Dieu! You are unmasking, Mr.&#xD;
Wales; and are you not afraid?"&#xD;
He did not look like it certainly, with&#xD;
the smiling lips and the bright gleam in his&#xD;
eyes. He had gathered up Tutu and won&#xD;
the coy friendship of that minute bit of ani-&#xD;
mation with his "tender hands," doing&#xD;
which he neglected to respond to the Ba-&#xD;
ronne's question.&#xD;
"1 asked you if you were not afraid?"&#xD;
she repeated with a little wondering at her&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
"No! Iwas; I am so no longer."&#xD;
"And why?"&#xD;
"Because," he said quickly, dropping&#xD;
Tutu and turning to her, "it is I who am to&#xD;
be your friend."&#xD;
For a moment they looked silently at&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;

4&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
each other, he with a rapt, almost exalted&#xD;
face, and she with wide-opened eyes am&#xD;
lips parted in a smile that had died at it:&#xD;
birth into something like pain. A threat&#xD;
held them apart at that moment - a little&#xD;
invisible thread that must break in another&#xD;
instant.&#xD;
Bnt she drew back before it parted. Nol&#xD;
yet, not yet! it was so sweet.&#xD;
"Grace, Monsieur le dompteur, it is I whc&#xD;
am afraid!" she cried with a laugh, and ris*&#xD;
ing as she spoke. "Are you a musician,&#xD;
Mr. Wales? Of course you are; music it&#xD;
essential to your system of soothing the&#xD;
savage heart."&#xD;
"I am no musician, madame, though I&#xD;
can play a little and sing a little," he an-&#xD;
swered, indolently. There was a little chill&#xD;
of disappointment in his tone that was not&#xD;
lost on her.&#xD;
"Ban! you shall both play and sing for&#xD;
me all the days when I wish it; n'est cc&#xD;
paz, mon ami?"&#xD;
"Ah yes! if you should ever wish it."&#xD;
There was no chill in his tones now.&#xD;
"I do wi4i it, even now," she cried. She&#xD;
had tripped across the salon and thrown&#xD;
open a little gem of a piano as she spoke,&#xD;
and now she came back to him, where he&#xD;
still sat watching her movements, and&#xD;
caught him by the arm, like an impulsive&#xD;
child that would not be denied.&#xD;
"Came, how delightful it is! No one&#xD;
ever plays for me that is, not as I care to&#xD;
hear. I am sure you will."&#xD;
Charley laughed happily and obeyed.&#xD;
He ran over some rambling snatches of&#xD;
Mendelssohn with the rare expression which&#xD;
was his peculiar gift, while Nina leaned on&#xD;
the instrument and watched him with spark-&#xD;
ling eyes. She worshipped music, and&#xD;
made it almost her key-note of character;&#xD;
and the firm but soft touch of the young&#xD;
man, modulated to the ordinary force of a&#xD;
woman's hand, but eloquent of concealed&#xD;
strength, was all her heart craved in him.&#xD;
"How beautiful I" she murmured, when&#xD;
he came to a pause, - meaning his music,&#xD;
probably, but looking at him.&#xD;
"And now, &amp;amp; vous!" he said, rising.&#xD;
She looked at him silently, as if she had&#xD;
not heard the request.&#xD;
"Do sing something for me," he pleaded,&#xD;
coming around to her. Some scattered&#xD;
sheets of music lay upon the piano, and he&#xD;
took them mechanically, waiting for her to&#xD;
wake from her revery. One of them caught&#xD;
his attention; a rough crayon-sketch of a&#xD;
head had been traced on it, and he turned&#xD;
to catch the light upon it. It was early&#xD;
twilight, or near it, and the room was dark-&#xD;
ening. He recognized himself, and turned&#xD;
to her with a quick impulse. She had&#xD;
awakened now, and was smiling and blush-&#xD;
ing all at once.&#xD;
&#xD;
I "Fi I give it to me," she cried, and made&#xD;
I a little snatch at it, which simply resulted&#xD;
in his catching her hand and holding it&#xD;
I very tight.&#xD;
"There / you asked me to sing for you,"&#xD;
she said, turning her head away, and tug-&#xD;
ging feebly fur freedom. He released her&#xD;
at once.&#xD;
"Please do," he said.&#xD;
She sat down and sang some brief, sweet&#xD;
romance he had never heard, - sang it so&#xD;
soft and low he could only gather a few&#xD;
words of its meaning; but the perfect music&#xD;
thrilled him to the soul. He begged a repe-&#xD;
tition, but she rose when she had finished.&#xD;
"No; some other time. You sing 'An-&#xD;
nie Laurie,' don't you? Please sing it for&#xD;
me. I was once in an English school here,&#xD;
you know. Ah, how happy I was then!&#xD;
and I had a darling friend who sang it so&#xD;
sweetly. Sing it you, and I will go to my&#xD;
corner and be so exquisitely sad I"&#xD;
It was one of the few songs he sang well,&#xD;
had sung all his life, and it might have&#xD;
brought "exquisite sadness" to the tra-&#xD;
ditional man of stone to hear him on this&#xD;
occasion.&#xD;
When he concluded there was perfect&#xD;
silence in the room. He could not see the&#xD;
Baronne from his seat, and he crossed over&#xD;
to the canape He found her with her head&#xD;
buried in the cushions, sobbing convulsively.&#xD;
A deep, immeasurable pity for the wearied,&#xD;
unsatisfied woman of the world welled up&#xD;
in his heart, and for the moment vanquished&#xD;
every other feeling. He went down upon&#xD;
his knees, and sought her hands and kissed&#xD;
them tenderly with the few words he could&#xD;
trust himself to speak. Her hands clasped&#xD;
his in turn, and pressed them on her heart,&#xD;
as if to still the tumult there; but she did&#xD;
not lift her head or speak, until he had&#xD;
leaned over and with his lips touched her&#xD;
temple where it met the cushion. She shiv-&#xD;
ered at the touch, and drew herself away.&#xD;
There had been no mockery in her emotion,&#xD;
for she was very pale, and the eyes that&#xD;
met his were streaming with tears. He&#xD;
would have kissed these away, but she re-&#xD;
pulsed him gently. Once she faltered, and&#xD;
he caught her to him for an instant, but she&#xD;
struggled from his arms in the next.&#xD;
"No, no!" she cried, and her voice was&#xD;
like a wail in his ears; "pity me! pity me,&#xD;
and leave me!"&#xD;
As she spoke, her cold, clinging fingers&#xD;
twisted themselves from his own, and he&#xD;
arose without a word, gave the hands a last&#xD;
kiss, and moved away. His tears half&#xD;
blinded him, and he paused before he&#xD;
reached the door to clear his eyes. He&#xD;
heard his name uttered clear and strong,&#xD;
and with an almost hysterical tenderness,&#xD;
and turning he saw her risen from her seat&#xD;
upon her trembling limbs, with arms out-&#xD;

stretched towards him, and the pale face&#xD;
drawn with an agony of feeling. In an-&#xD;
other moment she was sobbing on his breast,&#xD;
moaning low, unintelligible words, while her&#xD;
hands wandered nervously in his hair. Then&#xD;
she crept tip to his lips with her own, cold&#xD;
and trembling as a frightened child's. Ex-&#xD;
cept those of her dead father, they had&#xD;
touched no other man's in all her lifb. And&#xD;
the rarest words that ever pass a French-&#xD;
woman's lips c~ame in a whisper to him,&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
A MESSAGJi FOR AMERICA.&#xD;
THERE are certain divisional periods in&#xD;
his work where the veracious historian is per-&#xD;
initted by ancient custom to pause; and while&#xD;
he generously enables the absorbed reader to&#xD;
draw breath after a series of thrilling events,&#xD;
to stretch the limbs and adjust the chair-&#xD;
cushion, and light a fresh cigar, he does&#xD;
something of' the kind himself; and in the&#xD;
interval of the acts goes rapidly back over&#xD;
the ground lie has passed, and gathers the&#xD;
scattered threads of his narrative well in&#xD;
hand before procee~ling. And at this point&#xD;
it is asking no more than the time-honored&#xD;
privilege of the old Chorus to beg the&#xD;
reader's indulgence for a little speech.&#xD;
Does any one cry "Speech"? Perhaps&#xD;
not; but strengthened by entertaining remi-&#xD;
niscences of the Speaker's Gallery and&#xD;
'Scotch dinner-parties, I encourage myself'&#xD;
with time example of those good souls who&#xD;
will speak, to whom speech is not to be&#xD;
denied, and mount my stump. If it unhap-&#xD;
pily shall be judged that I have hurried my&#xD;
hero too rapidly from point to point in a&#xD;
career that savors somewhat of the descen-&#xD;
.sus A verno in the nostrils of the righteous,&#xD;
I have told the tale badly, and failed in an&#xD;
honest endeavor to give some redeeming&#xD;
color to the fatalities which dogged our&#xD;
Charley's path. it was certainly my hope&#xD;
to divest them in a measure of their sinful&#xD;
and irregular character, since, bad as they&#xD;
may be, they are but the precursors of worse.&#xD;
Having failed in this, as the ominous silence&#xD;
of my respected audience leads me only too&#xD;
surely to believe, I am impelled to express&#xD;
my regrets, as well as to insure my con-&#xD;
science by the addition of something like a&#xD;
warning. I regret, then, for a certain por-&#xD;
tion of my hearers, that my story is not one&#xD;
of peaceful scenes and virtuous deeds; that&#xD;
my hero must needs fall lamentably short&#xD;
in those high and peculiar qualities which&#xD;
could endear him to their hearts, or even&#xD;
render him tolerable in their eyes; and that&#xD;
my little stock of incidents and the several&#xD;
characters who figure therein are probably&#xD;
&#xD;
too thoroughly of the earth earthy to meet&#xD;
their lofty requirements. And let me be&#xD;
saved from any subsequent imputation of&#xD;
leading any spotless feet into the mire Un-&#xD;
warned. I have intimated that the course&#xD;
of this history, like the course of most his-&#xD;
tory, tends from bad to worse. Therefore,&#xD;
withdraw all ye who would avoid the dan-&#xD;
gerous exposure with dignity and prudence.&#xD;
I bow to your superior views of' life in all&#xD;
humility. 1 weep that all the world is not&#xD;
so good as you, and I lower my eyes, inno-&#xD;
cent of resentment, before the cold condem-&#xD;
nation of your glances as you pass out.&#xD;
To the few who remain I turn with a&#xD;
lighter heart. I am relieved, and I may&#xD;
even venture a smile of sympathy as I re-&#xD;
sume my story; and if, in my covert study&#xD;
of tIme upturned faces bef'ure me, I shall de-&#xD;
tect here and there one lighted by gleams&#xD;
of kindly interest that tell me I have awak-&#xD;
ened the hearer's emotions, and that I may&#xD;
end by soothing a bitter memory and giving&#xD;
courage to struggling resolves, 1 shall be&#xD;
richly rewarded, and strengthened in my&#xD;
trust that it is from the lives of feeble men&#xD;
and women like ourselves, who, through&#xD;
much error, have fought their way to truth,&#xD;
rather than from the records of unblem-&#xD;

It was the afternoon of a burning August&#xD;
day at Paris, just two months after the&#xD;
events recorded in the last chapter; one&#xD;
of those fearful days when the asphalt&#xD;
scorches one's boots, and the yellow house-&#xD;
walls reflect a white beat upon tIme streets;&#xD;
when the industrious shower of tIme water-&#xD;
carts is repelled in a mist of steam, and the&#xD;
few loiterers on the Boulevards hug the&#xD;
southern wall, and even the impervious&#xD;
cochers seek the interiors of their cabs or&#xD;
abandon the same for the nearest eslarninet,&#xD;
to groan and sweat over en(lless but inef-&#xD;
fectual hocks of icy beer. The Gardens of&#xD;
the Tuileries, the Champs Monceaux, amid&#xD;
even the little crescent o C green at the new -&#xD;
Church of the Trinity, are tIme refuge of per-&#xD;
spiring thousands, who linger in the grateful&#xD;
shade, but with the inextinguishable vivacity&#xD;
of their race defeat its kindly service by&#xD;
lively gossip and restless movement. Out&#xD;
in the Bois, one finds whole lines of deserted&#xD;
carriages along the shaded drives, with their&#xD;
sleepy Jehus watching them from under&#xD;
adjacent trees, while stray peals of laughter&#xD;
from hidd~ii corners of the tangled foliage&#xD;
tell of the wandering occupants. At&#xD;
Neeser's, an pxmy of half-melted gar~ons&#xD;
struggles against nature in furnishing the&#xD;
brewage of Munich to another army of&#xD;
suffering consumers; and in Rue Scribe&#xD;
one may see at intervals some adventurous&#xD;

&#xD;
same. In all this he found matter for much&#xD;
self-congratulation; but it should be said in&#xD;
his favor, that he did have a little sympa-&#xD;
thetic twinge for Charley; he "liked the&#xD;
boy," and wondered, with a spark of regret,&#xD;
why he could not have been "one of another&#xD;
sort." "Huntley means his ruin, and what&#xD;
Runtley means to do he does. I 'm sorry;&#xD;
I wish lie had left me out ofit; it's fishy!"&#xD;
But the fine Anglo-Parisian did not per-&#xD;
mit this single disturbing thought to mar&#xD;
the felicity of the moment. In the form&#xD;
employed by deliberative bodies his medi-&#xD;
tations might have been summed up thus -&#xD;
Whereas, the said Charles is a victim to&#xD;
certain mysterious combinations of the said&#xD;
Huntley, and is therefore entitled to com-&#xD;
miseration by reason of his many excellent&#xD;
and attractive qualities; and,&#xD;
Whereas, the said Huntley is a devilish&#xD;
clever and altogether formidable fellow,&#xD;
whose orders are in no respect to be ques-&#xD;
tioned, and who, moreover, is not ungener-&#xD;
ous in his recognition of services rendered;&#xD;
and,&#xD;
Whereas, the said Somers is infernally&#xD;
lucky to have served the one without hay-&#xD;
ma actually wrought injury to the other;&#xD;
'ileit resolved, that Trouville-sur-Mer&#xD;
offers at this moment a harbor of exceeding&#xD;
peace to the said Somers, to which, at this&#xD;
auspicious juncture of his affairs, it is voted&#xD;
that he shall without delay proceed, to en-&#xD;
joy a fitting respite from his labors in town.&#xD;
The simple fact was, that while Somers&#xD;
really felt a strong liking for Charley, he&#xD;
felt a stronger fear of Huntley; and there&#xD;
is no choice in life between the master one&#xD;
{ears and the master one likes.&#xD;
Diaposing of the final details of his prep-&#xD;
aration, Somers strolled around to the bank-&#xD;
er's, where he found some letters for Char-&#xD;
hey, which he brought away. He had done&#xD;
the same with exemplary regularity for two&#xD;
months, and forwarded the missives from&#xD;
various conycuient stations of the post, but&#xD;
never from the bank, where the question of&#xD;
Mr. Wales's whereabouts was one of no&#xD;
little mystery. This day he returned to&#xD;
his apartments and made a neat packet of&#xD;
the letters, elevating his eyebrows slightly&#xD;
as he noted the feminine character of their&#xD;
superscriptions. This packet he addressed&#xD;
to adittle-known Swiss village, -one of that&#xD;
vast colony of chalet-clusters where a sum-&#xD;
mer world hides its sins, - described in&#xD;
modern vernacular as "a small hamlet of&#xD;
Vaud, mule snetres de kauteur," and possess-&#xD;
ing the varied advantages of magnificent&#xD;
view, pure air, grape-cure, and cure of&#xD;
milk, courses de montagnes et prix mod6'e's.&#xD;
He smiled to himself oyer the task, and&#xD;
sang, softly,&#xD;
"Zwei Seelen und em f3edanke,&#xD;
Zwei Herien und cm Schiag."&#xD;
&#xD;
After which he gave the packet to the con-&#xD;
cierge to post, and bidding that amiable but&#xD;
desolated female an impressive farewell,&#xD;
bestowed himself forthwith in a cab, with&#xD;
his impedimenta, and drove gayly to St.&#xD;
Lazare. Not many hours later he descend-&#xD;
ed at the Arm of Gold, and there was joy&#xD;
among the nymphs of ocean, by whom the&#xD;
"Hercules" of Nina Choisy was gayly des-&#xD;
lo-nated Pare Neptune"; and in their de-&#xD;
lightful keeping we will leave him.&#xD;
The world gossiped, as it gossips ever, in&#xD;
the long, idle, summer days, and the invisi-&#xD;
ble agencies which bring in the supplies&#xD;
furnished more than one mysterious whis-&#xD;
per about the Baronne Choisy. Some Paris&#xD;
friends, bound to Switzerland and pausing&#xD;
at Lyons, discovered the fact of her absence&#xD;
from the chateau, and sent the news hack&#xD;
to Paris as a bonne boucke for the stay-at-&#xD;
homes; and from that point the wonder&#xD;
grew, and grew the more rapidly because&#xD;
there was no clew to her whereabouts.&#xD;
Somers, cornered at the club, denied the&#xD;
fact; driven from that, he confessed un-&#xD;
bounded surprise and utter ignorance;&#xD;
and so the busy bees, left to their devices,&#xD;
searched Europe for the lovely Nina, and,&#xD;
finding her nowhere, established her every-&#xD;
where, in one place after another, and&#xD;
sometimes in several at once.&#xD;
Then there came a lull, and the false&#xD;
oracles, warned by instinct, were silent as&#xD;
tombs. Some gallant club-men, afflicted&#xD;
with the Alpine mania of clog-soles and&#xD;
empty knapsacks, stumbkd upon the miss-&#xD;
ing divinity among the lower hills. They&#xD;
were unambitious climbers, and shunned&#xD;
Chamounix and St. Gothard for the Or-&#xD;
monts and cheap roulette at Saxon; hence&#xD;
their falling into sequestered paths. ~7hey&#xD;
came back to Paris, and, like discreet&#xD;
Frenchmen, retained their discovery until&#xD;
they had dined; before they dined again,&#xD;
it was known from the Tuileries to the&#xD;
Faubourg Poissonninre that the dashing&#xD;
queen of the Avenue de ha Rcine Hortcnse&#xD;
was (tout bas!) en liaison, sais-tu, avec ce&#xD;
jeune Americain de les grand yeax bruns!&#xD;
"Enfin!" cried the united Jockey Club;&#xD;
and with the afterthought it looked at itself&#xD;
in the glass, twirled its mustache, and said,&#xD;
under its breath, " Comment diable!"&#xD;
Mr. Cheerful Scribbler, Paris correspond-&#xD;

the rattle of table-talk at the Cafh Anglais.&#xD;
He made hurried notes of the ease, which&#xD;
he subsequently elaborated at his aerial&#xD;

came to pass that in tl:e waning summer&#xD;

We find the Jennings household, of&#xD;
which Enima lowland is a treasured mem-&#xD;
ber, installed in their cottage on the cliffs,&#xD;
where, indeed, they have passed the sum-&#xD;
mer. The gay world has seen little of&#xD;
Miss Rowland, however, and ~t is whispered&#xD;
that she is broken in health. As we see&#xD;
her this hazy afternoon, sitting with the&#xD;
rose-checked Clare in the shade of the east-&#xD;
ern porch, there would seem to be good real&#xD;
son for the report. The contrast is painful&#xD;
when one turns from the face of her merry&#xD;
friend, glowing and sparkling with life and&#xD;
health, to her own, so wan and colorless in&#xD;
the shade. The slender form, too, is more&#xD;
fragile than we knew it, and the hand which&#xD;
is twining itself in Clare's luxuriant curls is&#xD;
thin, and shows the dark, overlying veins&#xD;
all too plainly.&#xD;
Miss Jennings, with all the old child-&#xD;
manner, sits flat upon the porch, with her&#xD;
pretty head resting on Emma's knee, and&#xD;
her eyes staring blankly out to sea; the&#xD;
whereabouts of her legs - assuming, if we&#xD;
may, that she is possessed of those useful&#xD;
appendages - would best be described as&#xD;
"anywhere." TIme slant rays of the sun&#xD;
are Thlling beyond tIme cliffs upon sea&#xD;
and sail, and the drive is growing lively as&#xD;
fashion gathers to its sunset parade; but&#xD;
the silent girls keep their places, and seem&#xD;
to have no thought of the gay world with-&#xD;
out. Emma is the firbt to wake from her&#xD;
revery.&#xD;
"And Mamma Jennings is then quite&#xD;
decided?"&#xD;
"0 yes! You know she never decides&#xD;
twice, - I mean, she decides once for all;&#xD;
it 's as goo(l as done. And is n't it odd?&#xD;
After tensing her, a whole year to go, now,&#xD;
when it is certain to be, I feel a sort of&#xD;
shock; I think I am a little afraid. Dear&#xD;
me! I'm just like Nethdie; lie cried so&#xD;
hard to be let go to the minstrels, and&#xD;
when he saw their black faces he slid down&#xD;
on the floor and cried harder than ever to&#xD;
be taken home."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Have you lost your old desire to go?"&#xD;
asked Emma, smiling down at the upturned&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"0 dear, no! It is n't that, but I never&#xD;
thought much about the going, you know,&#xD;
and there 's that awful sea! I was fright-&#xD;
ened to death every moment the oIlier day&#xD;
when we were out in the yacht with Mr.&#xD;
Huntley. I shall be just good for nothing,&#xD;
I know, the whole way over. But I am&#xD;
glad, ever so glad! 'Not all 01(1 Neptune's&#xD;
flood,' as that darling Booth says, can&#xD;
wash that out!' And are you riot too ?&#xD;
"I shall enjoy it very much, very much&#xD;
indeed," answered Emma, quietly.&#xD;
In the interval of silence which followed,&#xD;
Clare caught the thin hand in her own and&#xD;
looked up softly.&#xD;
"Have you thought, dear, we might run&#xD;
across that naughty Charley somewhere?"&#xD;
There was the faintest possible flush on&#xD;
Emma's face, but no answering pressure of&#xD;
the hand.&#xD;
"I have thought of it, it seems quite&#xD;
possible. I should be very glad if we&#xD;
might."&#xD;
"'Would it not be nice! But what a lec-&#xD;
ture 1 shall give him. I shall study it up&#xD;
all the way. There 's mamma calling to&#xD;
know if we are going to ride. You don't&#xD;
care to? 1 '11 run and tcll her, an4 come&#xD;
back."&#xD;
Miss Rowland leaned back wearily in&#xD;
her chair, a great, soft wick er-work affair,&#xD;
that seemed to fold her in its arms in con-&#xD;
scious sympathy. The mention of' Charley's&#xD;
name had awakened painful thoughts -&#xD;
thoughts that sometimes slept, but never&#xD;
left her; and her eyes, looking upon the&#xD;
darkened waters, were dim and saw them&#xD;
not. Bravely and hopefully h~d she waited&#xD;
for an answer to liner second letter, written&#xD;
in the winter,- the letter so full of affection&#xD;
and tender words, - the letter in which all&#xD;
that she might write she had written; but&#xD;
it had never conic. ~he could not know&#xD;
that he, the most negligent of correspond-&#xD;
ents at best, had begun a reply to it, be-&#xD;
ginning the work in England, hurriedly&#xD;
completing it in Paris, and ending by toss-&#xD;
ing the epistle into his desk. We know&#xD;
what became of the letter; she never saw&#xD;
it, and it was just as well, perhaps. For&#xD;
months she watched and hoped, invented&#xD;
ingenious excuses for him and accepted&#xD;
them for herself, and fought oft; to the last,&#xD;
the shadow that boded such misery to her;&#xD;
but with the long summer days the hope&#xD;
had died. If she could have heard of him&#xD;
but in(lirecthy, some ~vor(l to tell of his wel-&#xD;
fare and his feelings, if he were well and&#xD;
not unhappy, the burden would not have&#xD;
been so hard to bear; but lie wrote tono&#xD;
one, after that single letter there came no&#xD;
tidings whatever. It was the very worst she&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. HUNTLE]&#xD;
&#xD;
had feared; he seemed utterly blotted from&#xD;
her life.&#xD;
But the patient courage of the woman&#xD;
gave no outward sign of failing; neither the&#xD;
ever-watchful eye of Huntlcy nor the ten-&#xD;
der solicitude of Clare could detect any&#xD;
further eVi(lcuice of the bruised heart in&#xD;
word or manner. To the latter, who waxed&#xD;
wratliful and tempestuous over the non-arri-&#xD;
val of the fhmou~ fasliion.plates, she said,&#xD;
"We ought to remember what a whirl he is&#xD;
in; and you know he always made such a&#xD;
task of a letter."&#xD;
"I don't care!" flashed Miss Chare,&#xD;
"it 's just a shanme, and I shall scold him&#xD;
famously when he comes home with his&#xD;
waxed mustache and Paris airs. I '11 make&#xD;
fun of everything lie says, and ask him if it&#xD;
is true, as Nurse Rollin says, that they eat&#xD;
nothing but frogs there, and cut off heads of&#xD;
a Suiiday in the square for public entertain-&#xD;
ment. 1 wish lie was here this minute !"&#xD;
Something, however, in this inspiring idea&#xD;
seemed to check the young lady's vindictive&#xD;
impulses, for she grew pensive at the thought,&#xD;
and ended by brushing away niore of those&#xD;
truant teirs. What drew them from their&#xD;
source was not quite apparent; but she was&#xD;
very tender to Emma thereafter, and in&#xD;
time they caine to speak very rarely and&#xD;
briefly of the absent one.&#xD;
Mr. IIuntk) bud asked Emma once quite&#xD;
suddenly, "You hear occasionally from&#xD;
your cousin, of course? I am in his black&#xD;
books; he writes me no more."&#xD;
"I have had but one letter from him;&#xD;
he was always a poor correspondent."&#xD;
There was not a tremor in lip or voce, and&#xD;
the heart of Ilumutley was glad. But the&#xD;
woman suffered; her pillow could have&#xD;
told a weary tale of tears, and the brave&#xD;
soul that bore itself patiently before the&#xD;
world faltered and grew faint in the dark-&#xD;
ness ami(1 solitude, and her health failed.&#xD;
This was the uuish)oken thought of all her&#xD;
friends; for, though there was no apparent&#xD;
disease, it needed ormly the comparison of&#xD;
the fadimig girl with her former self to con-&#xD;
vince the observer that she was really ill.&#xD;
She had never been a strong woman, hut&#xD;
from PkYsical delicacy she lapsed into weak-&#xD;
ness. Th~ anxious eye of Mi's. Jennings&#xD;
noted time change, and s'he had ventured&#xD;
once to question Emma very guardedly and&#xD;
carefully. But she n~met only with pained&#xD;
surprise, with unhesitating disbelief, indeed,&#xD;
at the time, which made further discussion&#xD;
of the subject impossible. She was so moved&#xD;
by her fears, however, that she ignored&#xD;
boldly the prescribed date of tIme fashionable&#xD;
hegira, amid hurrie(l her household down to&#xD;
the beach a month before the usual time,&#xD;
taking Emama with her.&#xD;
The niove was a serious inconvenience to&#xD;
Mr. Richard Iluntley. That gentleman&#xD;
&#xD;
~'S PROGRESS.                       75&#xD;
had made very satisfactory progress at the&#xD;
house in the Avenue, where he was grown&#xD;
to be something of an intirne, as he was also&#xD;
now a frequent participant in the business&#xD;
councils of Wales, Bwton, &amp;amp; Co. Without&#xD;
self-questioning and without the slightest&#xD;
anticipation that he could ever be more&#xD;
than the sympathetic an(1 congenial friend&#xD;
he was, Emma Howland'contiiued to meet&#xD;
him in her parlors, and after a time to&#xD;
accord him a certain preference which was&#xD;
not unnoted by her gentleman friends. Of&#xD;
their inferences she had no hint, and of the&#xD;
outside rumor she heard no word. But the&#xD;
advantage iva~ one that ilunticy budt on&#xD;
bravely; it thinned the ranks of his coni-&#xD;
petitors, and helped him to push that stolen&#xD;
march, of which the object never dreamed,&#xD;
with steady persistency.&#xD;
But the flight to Newport was a disaster&#xD;
to his arms; it occurred at a pet'ulialy un-&#xD;
fortunate period in his strategeticid game,&#xD;
and it is not to be wondered at if the&#xD;
guarded patience of the man gave way un-&#xD;

purely a borrowed quality with him, worn&#xD;
for a time and fbr a purl)ose. Tie lost his&#xD;
head, or came very near it, and went beyond&#xD;
his r6le, for he followed the party to New-&#xD;
port within a week, un(lcr a flimsy excuse&#xD;
of business in Boston; and as there was&#xD;
not a hotel opened in the place, they lodged&#xD;
him for three days at the cottage, during&#xD;
which time his devotion to Emma was so&#xD;
marked that even the unsuspecting girl was&#xD;
made momentarily uncomfortable by it.&#xD;
Then his blood cooled, and he caine back to&#xD;
town to think on whet he had (lone~&#xD;
Mrs. Jennings viewed the alThir in some&#xD;
perplexity. She was perfectly well aware&#xD;
of Miss Howland's feelings, an(l share(1 the&#xD;
general affection for the absent ('harley;&#xD;
but she was also very favorably ~lisposed&#xD;
towards the broker. She liked him, in&#xD;
fact, very much, and decided, after some&#xD;
reflection, that Emma would he made happy&#xD;
and rescued from that insidious decline by&#xD;
marrying him.&#xD;
"She is just wasting herself away over&#xD;
that wayward boy, who is forgetting her as&#xD;
fast as ever he can. If she would only&#xD;
learn to like Mr. Huntley! I think I'll&#xD;
speak to hei-"&#xD;
With this purpose she managed a t~te-~-&#xD;
l&amp;amp;e with Emma some days after Humintley's&#xD;
visit. It was in her own room, where the&#xD;
young girl often lingered, seated at the feet&#xD;
of the elder, for whom her affection was all&#xD;
that of a daughter, enWinced by an enthusi-&#xD;
astic sentiment of admiration and confi-&#xD;
denee.&#xD;
"I think you like Mr. Huntley very much,&#xD;
do you not, dear?" asked Mrs. Jennings,&#xD;
after a circumspect approach to the sub-&#xD;
ject.&#xD;

"0 yes I very much indeed. He is so&#xD;
agreeable, and so very clever, and was such&#xD;
- such a friend of Charley's, you know."&#xD;
"So he was. I remember."&#xD;
"I suppose he must be much older than&#xD;
he seems, he has seen so much of life and&#xD;
the world. He is really wonderful some-&#xD;
times."&#xD;
"I can readily imagine, though he has&#xD;
never exhibited his wonders to me," said&#xD;
Mrs. Jennings, smiling; "and you think&#xD;
him 'old'?"&#xD;
"I don't know, of course; not particularly&#xD;
old, perhaps; but forty or more, certainly.&#xD;
It is not easy to guess the exact age of a&#xD;
man like him."&#xD;
"Forty can scarcely be called old; men&#xD;
at that age possess deeper feelings than at&#xD;
any previous time."&#xD;
"I suppose so, &amp;amp;nd I have always im-&#xD;
agined Mr. Huntley to be a man of pecu-&#xD;
liarly strong feelings. One feels an in-&#xD;
stinctive curiosity about such people, a&#xD;
vague suspicion that their lives have been&#xD;
marked by great events, saddened by some&#xD;
heavy disappointment. Of course, they&#xD;
never speak of it, and one is left to one's&#xD;
surmises.&#xD;
"That does n't always follow, my dear; a&#xD;
man, many men, arrive at Mr. Huntley's&#xD;
age without having had their stronger&#xD;
affections engaged."&#xD;
"Do you think so? Of course, you ~re&#xD;
right; but I always think that passage of&#xD;
life belongs to earlier years."&#xD;
~' With women, as a rule, it does; hut&#xD;
with men, and especially with men who&#xD;
enter the world young and encounter much&#xD;
vicissitude, the sentiment often remains un-&#xD;
awakened."&#xD;
"But I am quite sure Mr. Iluntley has&#xD;
had his' experience.' I have detected indu-&#xD;
bitable evidences of it more than once."&#xD;
"Have you, indeed," laughed theeldier, -&#xD;
"you watchful puss! And in what, pray?"&#xD;
"0, 1 could scarcely explain in what,"&#xD;
answered Emma, blushing faintly. "Once&#xD;
or twice he has spoken of love, briefly and&#xD;
delicately; rather sadly too, and only as a&#xD;
man could do who has loved some one -&#xD;
"Or loves some one now," put in Mrs.&#xD;
Jennings, ('unningly.&#xD;
rphe shot fell short, however; Emma only&#xD;
mused, and after a moment said, innocently&#xD;
enough, "No, I should hardly think that&#xD;
possible."&#xD;
"What a child it is I" laughed Mrs.&#xD;
Jennings, bending down to kiss the upturned&#xD;
face; no one so well as she, the wise woman&#xD;
of the world, might know the rare value of&#xD;
that pure, guileless heart.&#xD;
"As I said," she continued, seriously,&#xD;
"men at Mr. Huntley's time of life and of&#xD;
a nature like his, if I judge him rightly,&#xD;
have intensely strong feelings. Whether&#xD;
&#xD;
they have had what you call an 'experi-&#xD;
ence' or not makes very little difference;&#xD;
if they conceive an affection, it is very deep&#xD;
and strong, and it must be a great misfor-&#xD;
tune for them if it is misplaced or made&#xD;
light of."&#xD;
"It would be very sad," said the young&#xD;
girl, sympathetically.&#xD;
"it would be more than sad; and it&#xD;
would be very wicked wilfully to encour-&#xD;
age or to deceive such a one, - would it&#xD;
not, dear?"&#xD;
"0, terribly! Could any one do that&#xD;
deliberately?"&#xD;
"There are some who would, I fear;&#xD;
very few; not you, I know, above all."&#xD;
"You good mamma! I would not, though&#xD;
- I could not!"&#xD;
"And yet - Listen, you funny child! I&#xD;
am going to tell you what every one in the&#xD;
world knows but you, - Mr. lluntley is in&#xD;
love with you !"&#xD;
Emma looked up for an instant with ter-&#xD;
ror and bewilderment in her eyes; then she&#xD;
flushed scarlet, and buried her face in her&#xD;
friend's lap.&#xD;
"0 Mamma Jennings, don't say that!"&#xD;
Mrs. Jennings was a little startled, de-&#xD;
spite herself, by the drawn face and the ap-&#xD;
pealing tone.&#xD;
"There, there! never mind, darling. I -&#xD;
somebody ought to have tuld you before,&#xD;
since you have got no eyes for yourself; if&#xD;
it had been sornd~ody 1 know, you would&#xD;
have seen it long ago! There is no harm&#xD;

that all my fine, preparatory questions were&#xD;
mistakes. I only wished to know just how&#xD;
you felt."&#xD;
"I never dreamed of such a thing!" said&#xD;
Emma, raising her pale, distressed face;&#xD;
"1 did not, indeed, mamma, and now -&#xD;
Dear me! I think I can see something of&#xD;
it. How stupid I have been! but~I did not&#xD;
know. 0 mamma! what shall I do?"&#xD;
And down went the glossy head again in&#xD;
despair.&#xD;
"Tut! It is nothing, child. The worst&#xD;
is over, and we will easily arrange the rest,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Jennings, with a little huskiness in&#xD;
her voice, as she patted the head lying on&#xD;
her knee.&#xD;
"I am so sorry! How could I have been&#xD;
so blind? And yet he was so serious, so&#xD;
old! 0 mamma! you don't think - have&#xD;
I - was I - encouraging him?"&#xD;
"No, pet; no possible blame can attach&#xD;
to you. But, child, why do you dwell on&#xD;
his age? Surely, lie is not so very venera-&#xD;
ble; he is younger in nature than half these&#xD;
ungoverned young men you know. After&#xD;
all, do you not like him a little, just a&#xD;
little?"&#xD;
The young girl was all alive now to the&#xD;
significance of Mrs. Jennings's words. She&#xD;

A GAIN OF GROUND.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jennings was perhaps the most formidable&#xD;
at that moment.&#xD;
"0,1 trust it is nothing!" said the lady.&#xD;
"These young bodies have their little mala-&#xD;
dies, you know, often as causeless as they&#xD;
are harmless. Miss lowland has had much&#xD;
sorrow, and, I fancy, was sadly afflicted by&#xD;
the unceremonious departure of her cousin&#xD;
in the winter. She is wonderfully tender-&#xD;
heatted; it is a pity we older ones cannot&#xD;
give these sensitive children a little of our&#xD;
savoir supporter, Mr. Iluntley; they are so&#xD;
absurdly given to bruised hearts and rainy-&#xD;
day sentiment!"&#xD;
"I trust Miss lowland has not fallen&#xD;
into that melancholy strait," said the broker,&#xD;
bewildered and enraged. The delicate&#xD;
manner with which she elevated him to an&#xD;
equality with herself as a grave senior, and&#xD;
her agreeable tone of confidence, were to-&#xD;
tally unappreciated by the gentleman.&#xD;
"Something of it, perhaps; if she were&#xD;
not such an angel, I should have less pa-&#xD;
tience with her. Do you m~ever hear from&#xD;
the runaway, Mr. hluntley?"&#xD;
"From - 0, Mr. Wales; he has quite&#xD;
discarded me. I hear of him, however, at&#xD;
Paris."&#xD;
He looked very much as if it were possi-&#xD;
ble to press further information from him&#xD;
on that head, but Mrs. Jennings showed no&#xD;
disposition to avail herself of the chances.&#xD;
"Indeed! enjoying himself, no doubt.&#xD;
They will do it, and Charley is like us all;&#xD;
if the scapegrace does not return to grace&#xD;
soon, though, I shall conspire against him."&#xD;
"And you would be a dangerous antago.&#xD;
nist!" Iluntley could not but say, though&#xD;
there was more evidence of the smart in his&#xD;
tone than he had imagined.&#xD;
"I should think I might be, Mr. Huntley,&#xD;
as I value the happiness of Miss lowland&#xD;
as I do that of my own daughters."&#xD;
After this he saw Emma, but always in&#xD;
the company of Mrs. Jennings, who, with a&#xD;
quiet persistency that foiled him effectually,&#xD;
assumed entire supervision of their inter-&#xD;
course, and shaped it according to her&#xD;
desires. He was bewildered by suspicion&#xD;
and anxiety, and the constraint he had not&#xD;
failed to detect in Emma's manner - for&#xD;
even under the broad, protecting wing, she&#xD;
felt a strange embarrassment in Huntley's&#xD;
presence - did not ten(l to quiet his alarm.&#xD;
It drove him to cx pedients, and under cover&#xD;
of a yachting party lie had hoped to escape&#xD;
the watchful guardian; but even in this, and&#xD;
to the speechless astonishment of her proge-&#xD;
fly, who knew her deep antipathy to boats&#xD;
of all kinds, Mrs. Jennings came resolutely&#xD;
to the front, and Mr. Huntley cycutually&#xD;
returned to New York in a state of despera-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Learning there of the European project,&#xD;
which had notbeen mentioned tohimatNew-&#xD;
&#xD;
port, he repaired incontinently to his quar-&#xD;
ters, hurled a fine new Christy at Venus&#xD;
Callipyge, and, glaring angrily at the man&#xD;
in the mirror, "d-d his luck" in no gentle&#xD;
terms. It was aggravating beyond words&#xD;
to have a complication more alarming, if&#xD;
possible, than all he had overcome, arise at&#xD;
this juncture of affairs. Only a little time&#xD;
before - it was when lie received tIme satis-&#xD;
factory advices of Mr. Somers at Paris -&#xD;
he had surveyed the field with exultant feel-&#xD;
ings, and like a great strategist, who has&#xD;
gained by covered movements the key aof&#xD;
the position, felt victory within his grasp.&#xD;
And now ! - it was bad enough to have&#xD;
Miss lowland dragged away from town a&#xD;
month earlier than he h~d expected, and to&#xD;
have that in- clever "Mamma Jennings"&#xD;
stepping between them, as she for some in-&#xD;
explicable reason seemed disposed to do.&#xD;
But to go to Europe - why, it was ruin&#xD;
out and out to all his plans! At the least,&#xD;
it would make slicer waste of all his months&#xD;
of careful advances, and night lead to -&#xD;
to anything,'cverything, lie did not like to&#xD;
think what. The man of passion got the&#xD;
better of the schemer at this thought.&#xD;
In his anger lie seized on a very small&#xD;
weapon indeed; for alighting on a copy of&#xD;
the "Tattler" containing the letter of Mr.&#xD;
Cheerful Scribbler which I have noted, lie&#xD;
sent marked duplicates of it by post to Mr.&#xD;
IVales and Miss Howland. After thia noble&#xD;
thrust lie smoothed his front, gathered all&#xD;
his hopes and fears and anger and love in&#xD;
one deep resolve, and in the last week of&#xD;
August went down to Newport to put it to&#xD;
the touch.&#xD;
Emma lowland, sitting alone in the twi-&#xD;
light, murmured again the glad words of&#xD;
Clare, simple echo as they had been to&#xD;
her unspoken but governing thought: "Per-&#xD;
haps I shall see him there! It seems even&#xD;
like a certainty, and yet how far away,&#xD;
how dreamlike! I wonder would he think&#xD;
me much changed; I wonder -"&#xD;
"Ah, you poor dear! I thought it was&#xD;
only about time drive, and behold, a long list&#xD;
of instructions from mamma, which has kept&#xD;
me all this time. Letters from New York;&#xD;
and fancy you dear impassive thing! -&#xD;

he could not do less; and she could not&#xD;
refuse to permit him. He was tenderness&#xD;
itself in arranging the big chair and its&#xD;
cushions in the cool parlor, full of a play-&#xD;
ful, petting attention and merry words&#xD;
that won her smiles and almost her heart.&#xD;

"I am ashamed to have been such a&#xD;

He looked the picture of dejection; but&#xD;
0, how his heart was battling in its strong&#xD;
walls! He needed all his matchless self-&#xD;
control now.&#xD;
"And thus you reward me by sending&#xD;
me away!" he said, with comic but mean-&#xD;
ing melancholy.&#xD;
"0 no!" said Emma, uneasily, "but I&#xD;
thought-"&#xD;
"Let me stay, please. I will be good.&#xD;
Shall I read you something" (it was so in-&#xD;
nocent to be read' to !) - something from&#xD;
this?" he added, taking a little volume&#xD;
from the table. "It looks like a favorite;&#xD;
well used."&#xD;
Could there be danger in that calm face?&#xD;
She looked at him covertly, and smiled&#xD;
when she saw the book.&#xD;
"Would it amuse you to read that?" she&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"I especially admire Heine," he respond-&#xD;
ed quietly, turning the pretty leaves; "once&#xD;
I was quite diseased with his verse, 1 as-&#xD;
sure ~'on; there are some rare gems among&#xD;
the Lieder, this, for example, -&#xD;
'Du bist wie eiae Blume&#xD;
So hold und schiin und rein.'&#xD;
I see you have marked it. And fancy him,&#xD;
the man of reckless, dissolute life, writhing&#xD;
upon a bed of agony and dictating the soft-&#xD;
est, sweetest lines in poetry!"&#xD;
"It is strange," answered Emma, absent-&#xD;
ly; but whether it were Heine on whom&#xD;
her thought rested, or the present Huntley,&#xD;
who was one never-ending revelation, it&#xD;
would be difficult to determine.&#xD;
He toyed idly with the book for some&#xD;
time in silence, and she, stealing a glance&#xD;
at him, felt her fears rising again.&#xD;
"The thought that you are going away&#xD;
so -soon and so far haunts m~ and spoils all&#xD;
my efforts to be agreeable," he cried at la'~t,&#xD;
tossino' the l~jou volume upon the table des-&#xD;
perate~y. "I can't think what will become&#xD;
of us when you are gone, and yet I doubt&#xD;
if you have many regrets."&#xD;
"0 Mr. Huntley, that is not kind!&#xD;
One does not go away from home without&#xD;
regrets. It is only the companionship of&#xD;
Mrs. Jennings and Clam that reconciles&#xD;
me to it at all."&#xD;
it was not much to say, but she said it&#xD;
&#xD;
more warmly than she thought.' There&#xD;
was another interval of silence, in which she&#xD;
felt his eyes upon her, and grew almost&#xD;
faint with dread, straining her ears in the&#xD;
desperate hope that some one would come.&#xD;
But no one did.&#xD;
"And you have no idea when you may&#xD;
return," he continued, pathetically. "Mrs.&#xD;
Jennings speaks of spending several years&#xD;
abroad; should you remain so long away&#xD;
also?"&#xD;
"0 no ! - that is, I think not. It will&#xD;
depend - I - I had not thought much&#xD;
about it."&#xD;
She had struggled bravely to form a con-&#xD;
nected sentence, having all the time a shud-&#xD;
dering consciousness that he had risen and&#xD;
come to her side; but for her life she could&#xD;
not raise her eyes. He stood there a mo-&#xD;
ment, silent, and then spoke in low, tremu-&#xD;
lous tones that she lono' remembered.&#xD;
"Miss Howland -~mma - do not go,&#xD;
or, if you will, let me go with you."&#xD;
There it was! all she had feared and&#xD;
dreaded so much! What could she say?&#xD;
O for Mamma Jennings - anybody - or&#xD;
an earthquake! She made a mighty ef-&#xD;
fort and met his eyes. There were tears in&#xD;
them, and this vanquished her.&#xD;
"0 Mr. Huntley, I am so sorry! I am&#xD;
afraid I did - did not understand."&#xD;
He was on his knee and had her hand,&#xD;
kissing it softly and trying to catch her eye.&#xD;
"My darling! may I tell you all?"&#xD;
Something flashed and thundered in her&#xD;
brain. "Charley! Charley!" was its bur-&#xD;
den. She snatched her hand away with a&#xD;
shuddering spasm. "0 no, no, no! for-&#xD;
give me, Mr. Huntley. I ha~ e been wrong.&#xD;
I did not dream until Mrs. Jennings told -&#xD;
I don't know what I am saying. Please&#xD;
leave me - some other time -" Her agi-&#xD;
tation was terrible; it frightened him, and&#xD;
he got up quickly.&#xD;
"My dear Miss Howland, I beg your par-&#xD;
don. I have erred; forgive me, if you can;&#xD;
I shall not offend again. There, I see them&#xD;
coming; I will go away."&#xD;
The sad, contrite tone reassured her and&#xD;
gave her strength to speak. "One mo-&#xD;

forgiveness. I fear I deceived myself and&#xD;
deceived you. 1 never supposed, never&#xD;

"Do not speak of it more, Miss How-&#xD;

to look cheerful smote her to the beast;&#xD;

but Paris still dines. I am awfully glad to&#xD;
see you, though; came by Lyons, I sup-&#xD;
pose."&#xD;
"No, Basle and Strasbourg, - strateget-&#xD;
ical lines, you know."&#xD;
"To be sure, but it did n't matter. You&#xD;
know, I presume -&#xD;
"0 yes! I know," said the young man,&#xD;
rather carelessly; "no escape for the wicked.&#xD;
I suppose they have had it pretty well out&#xD;
by this time, however, among themselves.&#xD;
I tell you what, I was never so near mur-&#xD;
&#xD;
during any one as those sneaking club-&#xD;
men; there 's a tail to that affair. Mais&#xD;
enjin, how about this dinner?"&#xD;
"I know no word so joyful; let us&#xD;
away! Why! do you know, your welcome&#xD;
face has rescued me at the brink, plucked&#xD;
me from the Slough of Despond? It's&#xD;
horrible here now; Paris is always horn. Y&#xD;
ble in September. One kind of everybody&#xD;
is out of town, and another kind is iii.&#xD;
that is to say, every one you wish to see is&#xD;
away, and every one you particularly desire&#xD;
not to see arrives. Shall it be Yoisin's?&#xD;
Bien! As 1 was saying, it is the heyday&#xD;
of tourists; the place is rammed and jammed&#xD;
with them, and my especial horror, the&#xD;
peripatetic parson, with blue spectacles and&#xD;
a red guide-book, runs you down in every&#xD;
corner; he is more numerous than the&#xD;
sergeants de ville, and quite as ubiquitous.&#xD;
And your own countrymen swell the&#xD;
throng; to joke weakly, they make it more&#xD;
swell,' without making it less disagree-&#xD;
able. Fact is, I suppose, they arc all mi-&#xD;
grating homewards at this time, and make&#xD;
a week in Paris a sort of crowning episode&#xD;
to their travels; they swarm by the cab-&#xD;
ful in the streets, crowd you into a corner&#xD;
at all the cafe's, and turn the whole place&#xD;
into a menagerie of the nations. I always&#xD;
dread the time, and generally manage to&#xD;
avoid it. I have only just come up from&#xD;
Trouville."&#xD;
"So I presumed. I fear I was the cause&#xD;
of tearing you from its delights."&#xD;
"Not entirely; I should have come up&#xD;
any way, though it was jolly, - too jolly,&#xD;
if anything; one forgets the rules in such&#xD;
an atmosphere."&#xD;
Later in the evening, when the gentle-&#xD;
men were enjoying a quiet hour of cigars&#xD;
and conversation in their quarters, Somers&#xD;
said, "I have n't ventured to ask if you&#xD;
have any plans; of course, you will not&#xD;
stay here through this epidemic of tourists&#xD;
for the next four weeks; going below, per-&#xD;
haps!'&#xD;
"No, I am conge' until - until the. Bar-&#xD;
onne comes to town," said Charley, awkward-&#xD;
ly; "I was going down to do the Baron the&#xD;
honor of shooting over his domains, but it&#xD;
was arranged differently. To tell the truth,&#xD;
I did not care to go; I have n't lived in&#xD;
France like you, you know, for twenty&#xD;
years. I suppose there 's Cognac ili-dedans,"&#xD;
he added, going to the sideboard and&#xD;
drinking a liberal glass of the fine liquor.&#xD;
"Nina did not press it either, so I caine&#xD;
here at the last moment. By Jove! this&#xD;
brandy is elixir after that horrible eau de&#xD;
vie de raisin one gets in Switzerland!"&#xD;
"I believe you, and Madame will come&#xD;
up early, sans doute. You left her well?"&#xD;
"Charming! She said she should come&#xD;
by the end of October. By Jove! Ned -&#xD;
&#xD;
bahl No! I don't want to stay here;&#xD;
what can we do?"&#xD;
"Do? Fifty things! anything but re-&#xD;
main here. ~ou make me live again. I&#xD;
was afraid you would want to plant your-&#xD;
self in town, and live on sighs and palpita-&#xD;
tions until - Allons! what do you say to&#xD;
Brussels, - belle Bruxelles? I know it ivell,&#xD;
and it's nice; if there were no Paris,&#xD;
there would be only Brussels, Bois de la&#xD;
Cambre, and Waterloo. We can kill time&#xD;
there and thereabouts, and dodge the ex-&#xD;
cursionists, have a look at K~inig Wilhelm&#xD;
at Spa, and, if you fancy it, a run down&#xD;
among those fine old ancestral connections&#xD;
of you New-Yorkers, who go to the beaver&#xD;
in place of the bee."&#xD;
"Anything you like; you repudiate Tron-&#xD;
ville, 1 observe."&#xD;
"Ah! it would n't suit you now; chorus&#xD;
of mermaids at the tenth hour, recitations&#xD;
in sentiment till dinner, with slow music&#xD;
and mgne-cljose, intensified by wine, truffles,&#xD;
and gaslight up to any hour afterwards,&#xD;
-' all things common else' for you, old fel-&#xD;
low. Only the worn veteran like me,&#xD;
vois-tu, whose 'young dreams' have become&#xD;
middle post nightmares, may cheat himself&#xD;
with A transient flicker in the ashes when&#xD;
Aphrodite is chez-elle by her native element,&#xD;
and the accessories are pretty. I was re-&#xD;
juvenated at Trouville; you would be hor-&#xD;
ribly g~nc2'&#xD;
"'Most reverend Nestor! Let me em-&#xD;
brace thee, good old chronicle, that hast so&#xD;
long walked hand in hand with Time.' As&#xD;
you elect, however; Brussels be it!"&#xD;
"'Up men, and at 'em!' Shall we go&#xD;
over to-morrow?"&#xD;
"The sooner the better, I should say;&#xD;
you have made me really nervous about I&#xD;
exposing myself to the army of invasion&#xD;
hereabouts."&#xD;
"As well you may be; I shudder to think&#xD;
of your fate if you fell in with Brown and&#xD;
Jones -"&#xD;
"'Thompson' vous-voulez dire?"&#xD;
"Exactly; 'acquaintances from home,'&#xD;
and the course of whiskey, Avenue Mon-&#xD;
taigne, and apr~s quoi they would drag you&#xD;
through with all the national ardeur!&#xD;
Apropos, I bad a young Cock.ney consigned I&#xD;
to me early in the summer, a4 rare circum-&#xD;
stance, I am happy to say, - tourist in em- t&#xD;
bryo, but will be a marvel of his species if c&#xD;
he lives. I concentrated all Paris for him&#xD;
into two hours of cab, dinner at Bignon's, I&#xD;
and 'Bullier' in the evening, and packed a&#xD;
him off for Italy the next day. I thought&#xD;
the world might escape him, through the a&#xD;
happy instrumentality of the Maremma, -&#xD;
fancy Rome in July! - but he burst in on a&#xD;
me here four days ago, and delivered him- ti&#xD;
self of all Italy, from Vesuvius to the Sim-&#xD;
plon, in a solid hour of the Holborn ver-&#xD;
&#xD;
nacular. He was evidently under the&#xD;
impression that no one in modern times had&#xD;
ever 'swam in a gondola' but himself; but&#xD;
I put a wedge in his ~eonceit by assuring&#xD;
him that in having failed, as he acknowl-&#xD;
edged with confusion and regret, to look&#xD;
up Van Dyck's portrait of the Wandering&#xD;
,Jew in the Uffizi, he had missed the finest&#xD;
thing in Italy. It poisoned all his souvenirs,&#xD;
and my revenge was delicious!"&#xD;
They went next day to Brussels, where a&#xD;
fortnight sped pleasantly. Then they looked&#xD;
in at Spa, and found it rather dry; so they&#xD;
came back and took the "run" down&#xD;
through the Low Countries, for the fat cattle&#xD;
and very fat good people of which Somers's&#xD;
enthusiasm knew no bounds. After this&#xD;
the excursion took a wider scope, and they&#xD;
found themselves drifting up the Rhine&#xD;
country, glorious in autumnal dress, and&#xD;
straying in at Homburg and Baden, where&#xD;
the summer season was in its last ao~onies.&#xD;
It was all so pleasant, and made to" cover&#xD;
such a deal of time, that Charley awoke one&#xD;
day with a start of surprise at the fact that&#xD;
the "end of Oct ber," which had seemed&#xD;
so far away, was close at hand, and he came&#xD;
back to Paris at top-speed and in some-&#xD;
thing, of a flutter. Nor was he more than&#xD;
prompt; on the same day the household in&#xD;
the Avenue de la Reine Hortense was called&#xD;
upon to receive ~ts mistress.&#xD;
Some days after his return Charley&#xD;
strolled in at his banker's, where his ap-&#xD;
pearance created an unmistakable sensation.&#xD;
He stopped, as one learns to do, by the reg-&#xD;
ister, and ran a swift, careless glance over&#xD;
the long lists of arrivals, going back over&#xD;
the weeks of his absence. An entry - he&#xD;
dl but missed seeing it - caught and fixed&#xD;
his eye -&#xD;
Mrs. Charles Jennings and family, New&#xD;
York, Hotel Westminster.&#xD;
Miss Emma Howland, New York, Hotel&#xD;
Westminster.&#xD;
He read the names twice, with a glad&#xD;
shrill at first, with a sinking of the heart at&#xD;
~he last.&#xD;
Some one at his elbow asked, "Mr.&#xD;
IVales, is it not?"&#xD;
One of the principals was standing by&#xD;
iim with a letter in his extended hand.&#xD;
"It was privately enclosed, with instruc-&#xD;
ions to deliver to you personally. You are&#xD;
juite a stranger with us, Mr. Wales."&#xD;
"I have been out of town - thank you.&#xD;
s - are the party - I would say~Mrs. Jen-&#xD;
iings, still in the city?"&#xD;
"No; they remained a short time only,&#xD;
,nd went South about the 20th, I think.&#xD;
~sked several times after you, but, as you&#xD;
re aware, we could give them no informa-&#xD;
ion."&#xD;
"Yes - ah - you have their address?"&#xD;
"Nice, I believe; or no, Mentone.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7944-00000044"/>&#xD;
86                        CHOISY.                                                     THE LAST STRAND.                    87&#xD;
&#xD;
Bi'iggs, what is the address of Mrs. Jennings&#xD;
and party of New York?"&#xD;
"Mentone, Alpes Maritimes, sir."&#xD;
"As I thought; there was a young lady&#xD;
with them in poor health, I believe. Beg&#xD;
pardon! What did you say?"&#xD;
"Nothing - that is - they left no mes-&#xD;
sage for me, I suppose?"&#xD;
"None beyond the expression of great&#xD;
regret at not finding you here, as they had&#xD;
evidently expected to do."&#xD;
Charley struggled to ask one more ques-&#xD;
tion: "You saw Miss Howland, I presume."&#xD;
"I did not have the pleasure, I regret to&#xD;
say. She did not call at the hank, and I&#xD;
was not able to see her when I paid my re-&#xD;
spects at the hotel. She was poorly on the&#xD;
voyage, I understood, and the journey South&#xD;
was pushed on her account."&#xD;
"Thank you," said Charley, turning to&#xD;
go.&#xD;
"When it is convenient, Mr. Wales, there&#xD;
are some rather important matters of busi-&#xD;
ness -"&#xD;
"I will see you to-morrow, sir." And with-&#xD;
out more words the young man, unable any&#xD;
longer to command his emotions, hurried&#xD;
into the street and to his apartments. He&#xD;
had glanced at the letter, and, recognizing&#xD;
his father's writing, had simply crushed it&#xD;
in his hand, as he made his way homeward.&#xD;
Once there he dropped in a seat.&#xD;
"Emma here! gone South, and ill, and&#xD;
not a word or a line to me!"&#xD;
Then he tore open the note hurriedly, in&#xD;
response to a sudden, crushing thought, and&#xD;
found his answer there. It was a brief one,&#xD;
but he read but half of it. What he read&#xD;
was this:-&#xD;
"Your conduct seems to indicate a per-&#xD;
sistent intention to alienate yourself utterly&#xD;
from your family and friends, and I have&#xD;
ceased to hope that my admonitions can in-&#xD;
fluence you. But I make a final request,&#xD;
that you will so far respect the feelings of&#xD;
your cousin, who is going abroad in broken&#xD;
health, as to conceal from her your disrepu-&#xD;
table connections, of which she, at present,&#xD;
knows nothing. You would best do so by&#xD;
avoiding a meeting with her. I have only&#xD;
to add that the property descending to you&#xD;
from your mother and grandlhther has beeii&#xD;
p laced at your disposal, through the Messrs.&#xD;
Tompkins, and is put entirely beyond my&#xD;
control-"&#xD;
He stopped here, letting the crushed pa-&#xD;
per fill to the floor, and rose mechanically&#xD;
to his feet just as Somers came in at the&#xD;
door. The Bohemian was frightened by&#xD;
his face.&#xD;
"Hallo! I say - my dear boy, is it bad&#xD;
news'?"&#xD;
The presence of the man strengthened&#xD;
Chancy. "Bad is not the word," he said&#xD;
hoarsely, and, striding over to the cabinet,&#xD;
&#xD;
he drank off a great draught of brandy at&#xD;
a single swallow. Then he looked hard at&#xD;
Somers with unmeaning eyes, and added&#xD;
greatly to the alarm of that gentleman by&#xD;
laughing in a wild, discordant way.&#xD;
"Why, Charley!" cried Somers, gently,&#xD;
"what is it, old fellow? Can I help you?"&#xD;
"Listen, Somers," said Charley, in a tone&#xD;
that made the trained man of the world&#xD;
tremble for a moment where he stood, "I&#xD;
don't know much about you, but I suspect&#xD;
you would hardly go straight to Heaven for&#xD;
your good works, eh?"&#xD;
"Devil a bit, I fear; but Charley -"&#xD;
"Never mind, I have been hit hard. I&#xD;
used to be one of your good boys, I did, by&#xD;
G-d I But there was something undivine&#xD;
that shaped my end. Look here! there was&#xD;
one thing left in the world I cared about, -&#xD;
cared about more than I knew till just now.&#xD;
It would have kept me always from going&#xD;
too low, I think; but they have cut me out&#xD;
of that!"&#xD;
"But, my dear old boy -&#xD;
"Listen, let 's have a clear understanding&#xD;
and no mistakes. I like you wcll enough,&#xD;
and I don't want to be a nuisance to you;&#xD;
but I tell you, Ned, I am going the whole&#xD;
pace from this out. It 's the only thing left&#xD;
and I 'ye got the money."&#xD;
"All right, old fellow. It is not Ned&#xD;
Somers who will cry cover, be your game&#xD;
what you like." Somers spoke cheerily,&#xD;
but he was watching the young man closely,&#xD;
and whirled a chair under him just as he&#xD;
sank down, overcome by the combined et~&#xD;
feet of liquor and excitement. Then he&#xD;
put his hand on Charley's shoulder, and&#xD;
spoke earnestly, "I am your man for any-&#xD;
thing you like, Charley; but it 's a mistake&#xD;
to take these things too bitterly to heart.&#xD;
You say you are hit hard. 1 don't know&#xD;
how, and it.'s none of my business, but I am&#xD;
sorry. I caught it pretty bad myself at&#xD;
your age. My God! what are you to do&#xD;
with the chances at twenty-five? I took it&#xD;
badly, too, though I am not so prone to do&#xD;
so as you, perhaps; but I had n't a friend&#xD;
in the world then, in my strait, - et voih~!&#xD;
I have pulled through pretty well, have n't&#xD;
I? My good fellow! these yelping curs&#xD;
that hound down a man for some slip in life&#xD;
run nine in ten 'guiltier than him they&#xD;
try.' Don't give them the chance to think&#xD;
you felt the cut; that's the true philosophy&#xD;
of it. Come, we must go and breakfast,&#xD;
and send something after that liquor, or it&#xD;
will play the deuce with your head. We '11&#xD;
talk it out afterwards, and you will find&#xD;
Ned Somers with you, heart and hand, in&#xD;
anything you elect."&#xD;
He got the young man on his feet, and,&#xD;
subsequently, to the Helder, where he&#xD;
tempted him with an exquisite d(jeuner,&#xD;
and with ultimate success. In all his life&#xD;
&#xD;
Somers had never felt an impulse so thor-&#xD;
oughly unselfish and sympathetic as in that&#xD;
moment, when he read the old story of&#xD;
shipwreck which he knew so well in Char-&#xD;
ley's white, stricken face. He had had ex-&#xD;
cellent opportunities latterly to find out&#xD;
more fully "what the young fish was made&#xD;
of," and the result was an admiration and&#xD;
liking for Chancy such as he had never&#xD;
given to any other man, regarding, as he&#xD;
did, the whole sex as his natural enemies.&#xD;
And there was an unmistakable effort of&#xD;
conscience in his soul just now. He saw&#xD;
in Chancy's distress only Huntley's handi-&#xD;
work, and cursed that gentleman soundly&#xD;
in his heart for the same. He also felt his&#xD;
own connivance, and felt it sharply, though&#xD;
all in the dark as to its actual gravity and&#xD;
consequences, and he made a desperate re-&#xD;
solve.&#xD;
Half-way down a bottle of Margaux he&#xD;
asked Charley, guardedly, "Heard from&#xD;
Huntley lately?"&#xD;
"No; not in an age. I wonder at it,&#xD;
too, since - I suppose," added Charley,&#xD;
catching himself, "he is over head and ears&#xD;
in business."&#xD;
Tant micux for him, though I should&#xD;
think he might find time to write you, such&#xD;
friends as you seem to have been."&#xD;
"Good fellow is Dick," said Charley,&#xD;
carelessly, and drinking his wine rather&#xD;
freely. "But perhaps he has gone along I&#xD;
with the rest of them; does n't like my&#xD;
'connections,' you know. BahI let us not&#xD;
visit the good people, even in our thoughts,&#xD;
lest we should incommode them! Order I&#xD;
another bottle, will you, please? By Jove!&#xD;
I believe I am engaged to ride with the&#xD;
Banonne at three. I had nearly forgotten ii&#xD;
it."                                   I&#xD;
Somers had had it on his tongue's end to&#xD;
make a clean breast of the whole business, I&#xD;
so far as his connection with it went, and h&#xD;
show up Huntleyin his true colors to Char- t~&#xD;
ley. The words had fairly trembled on his a&#xD;
lips; but it required no little resolution to&#xD;
speak them, and the momentary diversion si&#xD;
occasioned by the your~g man's words led b&#xD;
to hesitation, and the hesitation demoral- p&#xD;
ized him. The brave resolve faded, as it&#xD;
had arisen, in a moment.&#xD;
"It could scarcely have iltencd things h&#xD;
now," said he to himself, as he sauntered h&#xD;
upon the Boulevard, after parting from t(&#xD;
Charley. His predominant sensation was&#xD;
one of relief, and he recognized the inter-&#xD;
position of chance as a saving demonstra- el&#xD;
tion of some superior intelligence. "It cer- C&#xD;
tainly would not have helped my case. Eh ta&#xD;
6ien, laisser aller!" hI&#xD;
And the probabilities involved in the fu- na&#xD;
ture pursuance of this maxim of life, touch- se&#xD;
ing himself and Charley Wales, formed the in&#xD;
subject of his afternoon meditations, as he t1~&#xD;
&#xD;
bent his steps towards the club-rooms in&#xD;
the Rue Scribe. Arrived there, however,&#xD;
he did not enter, but, acting upon a sudden&#xD;
thought, walked on to the a esherbes,&#xD;
where he went up to the pretty parlor, and&#xD;
with some inconvenience fished out from&#xD;
under the massive sideboard a crumpled&#xD;
bit of paper. His quick eye had caught&#xD;
it when he had come in and found Charley&#xD;
so disturbed, and his equally quick foot&#xD;
kicked it, unperceived, out of sight. It was&#xD;
the letter with which the reader is familiar,&#xD;
and which he now spread out and read&#xD;
without scruple. He was mdmch perplexed&#xD;
by its contents, as was ver~~ evident from&#xD;
his countenance.&#xD;
"It 's the old gentleman, of course, though&#xD;
he does n't subscribe himself 'your loving&#xD;
father,' or any of that sort of thing. 'Cous-&#xD;
in,' eh? Whole party safe out of Paris, as&#xD;
I knew before we left Baden~ I suppose&#xD;
it is all here, but I can't make it out.&#xD;
Something between the girl and Charley,&#xD;
perhaps. I 'd have sworn to a woman&#xD;
somewkere, by his face this morniwr. But&#xD;
what can Dick Huntley possibly Lave to&#xD;
do in such a case? He might - no, he&#xD;
would n't dare!" He paced up and down&#xD;
ron some time in silent meditation. "Just&#xD;
is well I did n't peach," he continued,&#xD;
recentlyy. "He 's the Devil's own Jack&#xD;
it a turn, is Dick. 'Gad! 1 am frightened&#xD;
:o think how near it I was. No, no, Ed-&#xD;
rand, thou must look to thyself first, en&#xD;
out eas. I 'm sorry, though, for the boy -&#xD;
uch a boy as he is, too; ''t is ever thus&#xD;
)elow, the noblest and the bravest,' etc.,&#xD;
~ar example I"&#xD;
And with this bit of melancholy mcmi-&#xD;
nent he cut short his ruminations. He&#xD;
~ut the letter where Charley would find' it.&#xD;
The business instructions must be noted.&#xD;
~y Jove! the figures are handsome," was&#xD;
is commentary. And, catching a glimpse&#xD;
rough the persiennes, at that instant, of&#xD;
n inviting apparition in purple and velvet,&#xD;
rhich stirred a memory of Trouville, he&#xD;
nized his hat again, gave a twirl to the&#xD;
londe whiskers, and hurried down to the&#xD;
pleasant street of palaces.&#xD;
"Eh bien! laisser allen!" The words&#xD;
choed still in the bright, pretty room when&#xD;
e was gone. The man, his nature, and&#xD;
is life were pictured and embodied in the&#xD;
~xt.&#xD;
Out in a shaded byway of the Bois the&#xD;
egant landau of Madame Ia Baronne&#xD;
hoisy crept lazily down the long line of&#xD;
11, dark trees, whose turning leaves trem-&#xD;
Led and glistened far above in the latest&#xD;
ys of an October sun. A marvellous en-&#xD;
mble; an eq~uipage which typified lux-&#xD;

incrs, forming an intelligent and respon-&#xD;

sive whole, governed by the mistress-will.&#xD;
The granq, high-spirited bays, instinctively&#xD;
self-restrained and walking gravely, almost&#xD;
softly, under the trees; ihe two bolt-up-&#xD;
right figures on the box, which might be&#xD;
men or statues in their graven immobility;&#xD;
the soft-cushioned, soft-tinted interior, elo-&#xD;
quent, in itself, of the sweet myth called&#xD;
Ease.&#xD;
The two who sat within were silent, and&#xD;
wrapt in thought. Nina was leaning back,&#xD;
and gazing dreamily away over the tree-&#xD;
tops, not unhappily, it would seem, from&#xD;
the shadow of a smile that played about&#xD;
her mouth. Charley's eyes, wandering also&#xD;
with a certain feverish restlessness, came&#xD;
back and rested on the beautiful siren-face,&#xD;
until that strange magnetism of the human&#xD;
eye won an answering gaze from the Ba-&#xD;
ronne, whose smile deepened then into one&#xD;
soft, passionate, winning beyond words.&#xD;
He turned towards her, and gathered up&#xD;
the little hand which lay so softly in her&#xD;
lap~ She caught it away with the same&#xD;
silent smile, tore off the pretty glove with&#xD;
one swift wrench, and put it back in his&#xD;
own, bare, warm, and rosy.&#xD;
"Nina," he said, in a low tone, that made&#xD;
her look more closely and seriously in his&#xD;
eyes, "do you remember once in Switzer-&#xD;
land telling me that I must surrender all&#xD;
the world, everybody, everything, for you,&#xD;
and then being very cruel to me because I&#xD;
begged a reservation?"&#xD;
"Mais oui, monsieur I you were merchant;&#xD;
you broke my heart. I do not forget it!"&#xD;
"Pauvre pehie che'rie! ecoute-toi, to-day&#xD;
I surrender it, Nina; today and forever I&#xD;
am all your own!"&#xD;
She sprang forward with a great flash of&#xD;
joy in her face, and studied his an instant,&#xD;
as if to read the full truth there, while a&#xD;
last, lingering shadow stole out of her glad&#xD;
heart, a shadow which had stubbornly kept&#xD;
its place and poisoned her happiness. It&#xD;
was all gone now; she kept her swimming&#xD;
eyes on his, drew his hand to her heart,&#xD;
and her lips murmured softly, "Bdbe'!"&#xD;
And he leaned down and kissed her&#xD;
silently.&#xD;
The statues on the box gazed ever in the&#xD;
air, the big bays tramped onward with&#xD;
stately grace, and up above the yellow&#xD;
leaves flashed and quivered in the sunset.&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
THE "WHOLE PACE."&#xD;
THE winter that followed was one of un-&#xD;
diminished glory and popularity for the&#xD;
Saronne Choisy. Her empire remained&#xD;
undisputed, her court as numerous and as&#xD;
devoted as before. The splendor of her&#xD;
&#xD;
entertainments was the marvel and delight&#xD;
of Paris; her presence, the coveted guar-&#xD;
anty of success in all social enterprises;&#xD;
and her box at the thronged opera the very&#xD;
centre from which radiated that subtle,&#xD;
electric current which sets in motion the&#xD;
delicate machinery of society. The world&#xD;
in which she moved seemed at her feet,&#xD;
governed by her caprice, and flattered by&#xD;
her very breath; and in that French day&#xD;
of days, le Jour de l'An, she might have sat&#xD;
upon a throne and defied the simple fashion-&#xD;
leader of the Tuileries to match her over-&#xD;
flowing court. And yet there was a shad-&#xD;
owy transformation as, when the curtain&#xD;
rises upon a new act on our mimic stage,&#xD;
we see only the self-same mise en scene, the&#xD;
self-same players, but note at once a new&#xD;
disposal. Some of the outward circle have&#xD;
come within, some moved a little apart.&#xD;
The play goes on, and in the swift unrav-&#xD;
elling of the little plot the central figures&#xD;
come more full&amp;amp; before us in their individ-&#xD;
ual parts; we are stirred with new and&#xD;
startling chords, with wild, sweet melodies,&#xD;
that speak to all the emotions of the human&#xD;
heart, and blind us, in our enjoyment, to&#xD;
the shadow of the denouement; but over all&#xD;
lurks the saddening thought that the two or&#xD;
three copyists of life to whom, in the open-&#xD;
ing, we lent our ready sympathies, have&#xD;
copied only too well, and are dooming us&#xD;
to a destruction of our hopes.&#xD;
The world gazed with a single eye still on&#xD;
Nina Choisy, but not as before, and she saw&#xD;
and felt the change. She saw it among her&#xD;
own sex in the new-found confidence with&#xD;
which some drew nearer, in the careful del-&#xD;
icacy with which others fell away; and in&#xD;
the unenibarrassed abandonment of that&#xD;
thin mask of hesitating reserve among the&#xD;
men, she saw it still more plainly. A&#xD;
nameless tone that this society had once&#xD;
possessed for her it possessed no longer.&#xD;
Luxurious, reckless, even depraved as&#xD;
may have been the social circles of the&#xD;
Paris of thiit day, some good lingered in&#xD;
her gilded salons. There was respect invi-&#xD;
olate beneath tIme sneer at virtue, and a&#xD;
pang followed the cold laugh at truth; no&#xD;
man was altogether dead to its presence, no&#xD;
woman could be callous tmp.its loss, and&#xD;
where it moved it was known and felt, val-&#xD;
ued by most, feared by all.&#xD;
Nina had lived proudly in her conscious&#xD;
superiority, and found delight in keeping&#xD;
that wolfish world at bay. She could do so&#xD;
no longer in the same spirit, and she felt&#xD;
the change, but only as a change; in her&#xD;
heart regret and bitterness had no place.&#xD;
She had given her all, but she had re-&#xD;
ceived an all in return, and she was con-&#xD;
tent.&#xD;
And as we see her, she was still a queen&#xD;
in her world, and a qacen she would remain&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
to the end; there was in her nature no&#xD;
atom of that sensuous grossness which could&#xD;
ever reduce her below the level of the best&#xD;
of her class. Wise questions for men to&#xD;
argue, whIch they have argued since Sol-&#xD;
omon in the vain hope to prove the woman&#xD;
as bad as themselves.&#xD;
She was happy, - briefly, guiltily, but as&#xD;
completely as it is often allotted to a child&#xD;
of earth to be. Those three summer months&#xD;
in Switzerland had been one swift, golden&#xD;
dream iii which every hope of her life, the&#xD;
girl-visions of earlier days, had the fullest&#xD;
fruition. In Charley the old, romantic ideal&#xD;
was swallowed up in a far more splendid&#xD;
reality. Young, noble in nature, with warm&#xD;
strong passions like her own, and much of&#xD;
the same graceful refining sentiment which&#xD;
clothed her dreams; that fine, iinagina-&#xD;
tive faculty which, being unearthly, gives a&#xD;
better color to earthly things; he was all&#xD;
she had craved, more than she had ever&#xD;
dared to hope for. They lived through&#xD;
those days like nature's children, where na-&#xD;
ture had rolled a wilderness of grand old&#xD;
hills about them, shutting out the prying&#xD;
world beyond; and when, in the inevitable&#xD;
course of things, that world found them out,&#xD;
Nina, who reasoned while Chancy slept his&#xD;
guilty sleep, sighed a tearful farewell to the&#xD;
hour of Paradise, and nerved herself to hold&#xD;
fast the substance of her happiness whose&#xD;
first, brief glamour was gone. She came&#xD;
back to her place in the field with the&#xD;
strong woman's heart braced for the contest&#xD;
she now foresaw; and though there were&#xD;
moments when the sweet vision of lover's&#xD;
life, of long, beautiful years of unbroken in-&#xD;
tercourse with him alone in some unnoticed&#xD;
corner of earth, arose in her brain, she dis-&#xD;
missed them calmly, as became the woman&#xD;
of the world, to whom the fancy was no&#xD;
longer illusive. Readily, however, as she&#xD;
did this, she could, never contemplate the&#xD;
possibility of a change, of separation, of any&#xD;
pause, indeed, in this new life. Her world-&#xD;
ly prescience was all at fault, and she&#xD;
shrank from the thought of a future without&#xD;
him; it had been her one uneasy, haunting&#xD;
fear, that he retained other ties in life which&#xD;
might some day prove stronger than that&#xD;
which bound him to her. Her joy at his&#xD;
declaration in the Bois may then be im-&#xD;
agined; it was beyond all speech, and found&#xD;
expression only in the low-spoken pet-name&#xD;
and the offered lips.&#xD;
If, from this day, she found ~n alteration I&#xD;
in hima new, almost fierce intensity at times,&#xD;
coupled with reckless abandon, she con-&#xD;
strued it gladly as a new proof that he had I&#xD;
wholly embraced his sort. He threw him-&#xD;
self into the glittering life (for in all places&#xD;
and at all times he was the Baronne's rec-&#xD;
ognized and envied attendant) with careless&#xD;
ease, with a certain grace, indeed, that&#xD;
12&#xD;
&#xD;
won the admiration of the clever an4 criti-&#xD;
cal circles in which they moved, and gave&#xD;
him a new charm in Nina's fond eyes. The&#xD;
beau petit Puritain, at whom she had some-&#xD;
times made a laughing moue, had disap-&#xD;
peared, and given place to the homme (le&#xD;
eceur, sufficiently inflamed for even the&#xD;
Parisian taste. No wonder that men found&#xD;
a new charm in her, that in the glowing at-&#xD;
mosphere of the Hotel Choisy the wild, gay&#xD;
world revelled with an added e'tan and fbr-&#xD;
got to pine for 01(1 Versailles and naughty&#xD;
Regents. The tropic glories of the Second&#xD;
Empire centered there, and thence distribu-&#xD;
ted their intoxicating influence. Antony&#xD;
sat down again with Egypt, and the mad&#xD;
throng gathered to the feast.&#xD;
Paris gossiped bravely over ce jeune&#xD;
A mericain, who drove his grand trotters in&#xD;
the Avenue do l'Imnperatrice with such re-&#xD;
sistless dash, and who infused a rare anima-&#xD;
tion into a certain coterie of distinguished&#xD;
sportsmen by unprecedented figures at the&#xD;
card-tables of the club.&#xD;
" On dit," said one, levelling his lorgnette&#xD;
at the Baronne's box, between the acts at&#xD;
the Italien, "that he lost a hundred thou-&#xD;
sand to Count Brie."&#xD;
"Voyons! a hundred and fifty. Somers&#xD;
told me so himself."&#xD;
"Sapristi! mais comment cela? it is then&#xD;
the American Crwsus!"&#xD;
"Sais pas; his horses shame the stables&#xD;
at St. Cloud, and they say a petit soupe~'&#xD;
he gave at the Maison Dor~e after the last&#xD;
Opera Ball was made to cost twenty thou-&#xD;
sand."&#xD;
"[neroyable! Mais oul; they were at&#xD;
the ball together, I was told, - he and the&#xD;
Baronne."&#xD;
"Yes; and Somers sur le plancher in&#xD;
Roman dress~iIe was superb; all the party&#xD;
were in costume save Madame and the&#xD;
American.~~&#xD;
"Joli cela! and you saw them?"&#xD;
"I saw Somers, he was magnificent; and&#xD;
Brid and old Goujon lz la Grand Ture and&#xD;
Marie Velours. Diable / it was an adven-&#xD;
ture! Me, I was struggling to reach an&#xD;
outlet, when I received a tremendous thrust&#xD;
in my side from the elbow -of a robust gen-&#xD;
tleman in splendid evening dress. You&#xD;
should have seen him, - the lace shirt-front&#xD;
and diamonds, satin-faced waistcoat, and&#xD;
Kiemel's best coat quilted with glace' silk!&#xD;
I turned in a rage, and met that round&#xD;
laughing face with the thick blond curls&#xD;
parted to the side like a boy's. It was Ma~&#xD;
lame Marie, and I had only to kiss the&#xD;
floor, while Somers, en service, was near&#xD;
lying with laughter!"&#xD;
"I fancy you, and the Baronne -"&#xD;
"In a box with Monsieur and some others.&#xD;
[did not see her."&#xD;
"Studying for the masque, sans doute,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7944-00000046"/>&#xD;
90&#xD;
&#xD;
which was celebrated at the Hotel Choisy a&#xD;
week later."&#xD;
"You were there?"&#xD;
"No, Bni6 told me something of it; but&#xD;
it beggared description. The American&#xD;
was Antinous in the scanty garb of Egypt,&#xD;
clothed in a brown dye, Bni6 said; and the&#xD;
Baronne an antique Helidniste, white toga or&#xD;
something, shell cameos and tiara and san-&#xD;
dals, with bare arms and bare ankles bound&#xD;
in broad gold bands."&#xD;
"Ciel! que j'eusse bu!"&#xD;
The noble Somers was in clover in these&#xD;
days, as may be imagined; the rejuvenating&#xD;
influence of merry Trouville was a trifle&#xD;
compared with the happy infusion of spirits&#xD;
which he experienced in his active partici-&#xD;
pation in Chancy's dashing career, for he&#xD;
was still our hero's faithful companion in&#xD;
arms. He was afflicted by no more twinges&#xD;
of conscience, since never after that ineinor-&#xD;
able day had he detected the faintest indica-&#xD;
tion of a wound or bitterness in Chanley's&#xD;
manner or words. If he reasoned upon the&#xD;
matter at all, it was not with a view to dis-&#xD;
cover if the young man's course of life was&#xD;
prompted by any secret trouble. On the&#xD;
contrary, it was to arrive invariably at the&#xD;
satisfactory conclusion that "the boy" had&#xD;
iIamensely improved his condition in life and&#xD;
escaped that premature repression of the&#xD;
mercurial tendencies which in his eyes was&#xD;
the greatest misfortune of existence.&#xD;
"'Gad I this is the sort of thing!" would&#xD;
be his unspoken thought, as he sat by Char-&#xD;
Icy and was whirled out the Neuilly way&#xD;
behind the trottens, admired of all beholders.&#xD;
"Fancy him tied to an apron-string, and&#xD;
walking the dull, domestic beat; and he&#xD;
might have been, and known no better.&#xD;
A trifle too much of the spur, perhaps,"&#xD;
he would further reflect, in the quietude of&#xD;
their chambers; "but he rides well, and&#xD;
nothing shakes him. It will all come right,&#xD;
nothing more certain. We shall have&#xD;
him duly installed in the seigniorial dig-&#xD;
nities one of these days, and everybody will&#xD;
live happy ever afterwards. Why does n't&#xD;
the 'stomach' die now? Mais enfin! It&#xD;
can't be long, and what a revolution we will&#xD;
work then in the ine'naqe down below! I&#xD;
thrill at the thoucrht, - boar-steaks and the&#xD;
Burgundy of unto~id ages! Compi~gne shall&#xD;
hide its diminished head. En attendant,&#xD;
pas trop vite!"&#xD;
'Let us give Somers due credit, too, for a&#xD;
certain unperceived, but really judicious&#xD;
guidance of Chancy's course. It was due&#xD;
to him that the experiments at dearte' were&#xD;
less frequent than they otherwise would have&#xD;
been, and far less costly than he, in a mo-&#xD;
ment of mischievous exaegenation, had led&#xD;
the oracle of the opera.st~il to believe; and&#xD;
in many other ways did he shrewdly thwart&#xD;
Chancy's occasional tendency to excess.&#xD;
&#xD;
The youtmg man's career was in all general&#xD;
respects sufficiently electrical to warrant,&#xD;
perhaps, the sententious commentary of the&#xD;
wise men that he was "going there by the&#xD;
early train"; but it was many shades less&#xD;
meteoric than it might have been but for&#xD;
the influence of the easy-going yet philo-&#xD;
sophical Englishman. Somers was not pro-&#xD;
cisely a saving agent, but he was still alive&#xD;
to the propriety of observing limitation in&#xD;
all things.&#xD;
The winter months sped in their giddy&#xD;
pace, with no respite or pause for Chancy,&#xD;
atom as he was in the dizzy whirl of Paris&#xD;
life. If graver thoughts and memories&#xD;
sometimes struggled for a hearing in his&#xD;
heart, he was amply supplied with means&#xD;
for their repression, and too thoroughly un-&#xD;
der the spell as yet to hesitate in availing&#xD;
himself of these means. His devotion to&#xD;
Nina was all she could demand. The air&#xD;
brought her more than one whisper of a&#xD;
rival, but her unerring instinct proved the&#xD;
whisper false, and kept her secure in her&#xD;
content, and in the assurance of his pro-&#xD;
tecting constancy. I use the word protecting,&#xD;
because she had seen nothing so quickly,&#xD;
felt nothing so keenly, in her changed state,&#xD;
as the presence in the smooth world about&#xD;
her of more than one watchful soul ready at&#xD;
the instant of her lover's disgrace to rush to&#xD;
the siecre where the citadel frowned down&#xD;
on thea no longer. It needed no dramatic&#xD;
episode to attest the entire fealty and the&#xD;
chivalrous nature of her chosen knight;&#xD;
nothing was needed, indeed, to add to the&#xD;
passionate gratification of the hour or feed&#xD;
the brief delirium in which she lived. She&#xD;
thought little of the future; or, if she did, it&#xD;
was as a far end to the glowing present, and&#xD;
that end was death.&#xD;
Among the habitues of the Hotel Choisy,&#xD;
and promi~ient in her circle, moved an ltal-&#xD;
ian nobleman, tolerated by reason of his po-&#xD;
sition, feared in a measure, perhaps, by rea-&#xD;
son of his high diplomatic connections, but&#xD;
universally detested for himself. He was,&#xD;
in fact, an embodiment of the least amiable&#xD;
characteristics of his nation, combining a&#xD;
Machiavelian cynisme with that haughty&#xD;
air of superiority which is almost a nation-&#xD;
al characteristic of Italians. Profoundly&#xD;
indifferent as Chancy was to the mass of&#xD;
fashionable he encountered in Nina's sa-&#xD;
ions, he had conceived an instinctive dislike&#xD;
for this man from the first, avoiding him&#xD;
when it was possible, and when brought into&#xD;
contact with him displaying a marked con-&#xD;
tempt for his dignity. His antao~onism was&#xD;
not diminished by a pettish declaration of&#xD;
Nina's that she "could not endure the crea-&#xD;
ture - mon Dieu! comme ii est noir!" And&#xD;
from that time his contempt speedily har-&#xD;
dened into animosity. Herein, however, he&#xD;
was at a vast disadvantage. In the delicate&#xD;
&#xD;
91&#xD;
&#xD;

Perhaps, in his wisdom, Somers bad furious; Somers smoked and was cool.&#xD;
hoped to startle Chancy into discretion. "By Jove! I don't mind telling you I&#xD;

the fact that the very contingency he hinted only this morning that the man was going&#xD;

&#xD;
it any the better for having foreseen it;&#xD;

out."&#xD;
But the Italian did not wait; he sum-&#xD;
moned Monsieur Wales promptly to the&#xD;
field, and Somers felt something' like relief&#xD;
when his messenger arrived. fietween the&#xD;
latter, a gallant veteran of Montebello,&#xD;
with a head well seasoned to Somers's cog-&#xD;
nac and a delightful enthusiasm for his of-&#xD;
fice, and the genial "Hercules," matters&#xD;
were quickly arranged; while Charley, es-&#xD;
caping from Nina, was struggling to master,&#xD;
an intelligent thought in his own room.&#xD;
Somers, looking in, saw him writing at his&#xD;
table, and withdrew at once. He allowed&#xD;
him only a brief space, however, and en-&#xD;
tered again in half an hour's time in a busi-&#xD;
nesslike way. The notes were finished and&#xD;
sealed, and Chancy sat in his chair gazing&#xD;
absently at the window, with traces of re-&#xD;
cent tears in his eyes.&#xD;
"Done, I see. Boa! I am to take&#xD;
these, I suppose?" said Somers, brusquely,&#xD;
gathering up the notes. He noticed cu-&#xD;
riously but quickly the same name upon&#xD;
one of them that h~id graced the letter&#xD;
which he found in the secretary in the sum-&#xD;
mer and forwarded to Huntley. Hunt-&#xD;
Icy would never get this one, he thought.&#xD;
"Come! breakfast and a turn on the road&#xD;
afterwards is the order of the day.&#xD;
Chancy got up mechanically, but shook&#xD;
off his dmil ness by an effort as they emerged&#xD;
into the street.&#xD;
"it 's all arranged, I suppose?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"All; Vincennes at sunrise in the ap-&#xD;
proved style; pistols at thirty paces, and,&#xD;
as I trust, rognons sautds and Cbs Vougeot&#xD;
at the fielder afterwards."&#xD;
Somers spoke lightly, but watched the&#xD;
effect; apparently he was satisfied, as he&#xD;
rattled off at once on other things, as they&#xD;
proceeded to Voisins. He gave Charley&#xD;
little rest during the day; they called a&#xD;
moment at Vasour's, and drove a long two&#xD;
hours in the cold afterwards, coming home&#xD;
to the Malesherbes in the early winter twi..&#xD;
light.&#xD;
"You will dine with me, of course,"&#xD;
Somers said.&#xD;
"I must go to the Hotel," Charley re-&#xD;
plied.&#xD;
Somers looked worried.&#xD;
"Excuse mc, Charley, but I don't like&#xD;
that. I must go with you."&#xD;
"If you like," was the answer in rather&#xD;
indifferent tones; indeed, since the morn-&#xD;
ing, the young man had remained rather&#xD;
impassive, and Somers did not quite like it.&#xD;
"By the way, here are my pistols."&#xD;
Charley looked at them with a momen-&#xD;
tary spasm of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
"They are beauties," he said.&#xD;
"A nice pair; I had them of an old In-&#xD;
dian friend who had faced the cat of the&#xD;
jungle with them after his rifle went wide;&#xD;
you can trust them."&#xD;
Before they left for the Baronne's, Char-&#xD;
ley said suddenly to Somers, "About those&#xD;
notes, Ned; if there is no occasion to send&#xD;
them, just burn them, please; don't give&#xD;
them back to ~&#xD;
"As you like."&#xD;
Somers's heart was relieved of a misgiv-&#xD;
ing when, on their arrival at the Hotel&#xD;
Choisy, Nina met them with a matchless&#xD;
assumption of gayety, and in the brightest&#xD;
of dresses. He read and felt what an ef-&#xD;
fort it cost the poor woman, and fairly rev-&#xD;
erenced her for it. But he permitted no&#xD;
relaxation of the r6le, and with his persis-&#xD;
tent and indomitable bonhomie made the&#xD;
hour one of lively, almost careless causerie,&#xD;
and at its end arose abruptly.&#xD;
"Allons! we must hunt a dinner, Mon-&#xD;
sieur Wales. I lead no empty warrior to&#xD;
the field, moi. Fais tes adieux!"&#xD;
Nina sprang up and came across to him.&#xD;
"Let me go with you; I will be good!"&#xD;
He would have been a man of much&#xD;
sterner stuff than friend Somers, who could&#xD;
resist the look and tone of the supplant&#xD;
siren. Still he begaa dubiously, "Mais,&#xD;
ma chere Baronne, vo~is savez&#xD;
"Oui, je sais bien, you will have no fault&#xD;
to find with me; I will go!"&#xD;
And she ran away to arrange her toilet,&#xD;
while Somers shrugged his massive shoul-&#xD;
ders and sighed an immense sigh.&#xD;
"0 these women! They do what they&#xD;
like with us. En passant, I see, Chancy,&#xD;

certain knowledge. I think I pointed him&#xD;
out, to you. I asked him once over the&#xD;
third bottle how the thing was done. 'l~oyez,&#xD;
mon ami,' says he, 'I play all the days five&#xD;
hundred francs. If 1 lose, I stop; if I win, I&#xD;
stop also.' I did n't see it very clearly, but&#xD;
I followed the rule for three days. I lost a&#xD;
thousand in the two first; on the third I&#xD;
won ten thousand, lost them again and five&#xD;
more in desperation. I suppose I did n't&#xD;
know where to 'stop.' Ah! voilii ma-&#xD;
dame!"&#xD;
Nina entered in charming street dress,&#xD;
&#xD;
and laughing gayly at Somers's las&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"Fancy Hercules'in desperation'! Wha&#xD;
a colossal emotion! Was it an aft aire dm&#xD;
ewur, par e.remple, in which you did 'no&#xD;
know where to stop'? Fi donc!"&#xD;
"Ah, madame, where I have loved, crue&#xD;
fate has ever stopped me short of m~&#xD;
hope!"&#xD;
"Pauvre 'petit'!" cried the Baronn&#xD;
with a little laugh. The next instant bein~&#xD;
for a moment in the shadow of the vestibule&#xD;
she caught Charley's hand with a convul&#xD;
sive clasp and carried it to her lips.&#xD;
"You are not sorry to have me go witla&#xD;
you, be'be'?" 'she asked.&#xD;
The reply was not in words, but she shud-&#xD;
dered to find it restrained, almost cold.&#xD;
Their dinner, in the luxurious privacy of&#xD;
a cabinet at Laurent's, was a rare feast,&#xD;
which approached a frolic, as the watchful&#xD;
Somers had determined it should. Beneath&#xD;
his irreliressible gayety, re-enforced by rich&#xD;
~vines and tempting dishes, there remained&#xD;
no tenable ground for sober thoughts, and&#xD;
the single serious episode which marked&#xD;
the occasion was a momentary affectation&#xD;
of melancholy on his own part when h~ re-&#xD;
verted to his forlorn state as the" unmated&#xD;
third"; and this was so far from serious that&#xD;
Nina laughed till the tears ran down her&#xD;
cheeks at his grotesque face.&#xD;
"How desolate he looks! therchons une&#xD;
Omphale pour notre A icide!"&#xD;
" Une?" cried Charley, joining in the&#xD;
feverish merriment. " Voyons! nothing&#xD;
short of a demi-douzaine of the nymphs of&#xD;
Trouville would suffice his expansive heart,&#xD;
~pax moms!"&#xD;
"Or all the Muses for variety! I believe&#xD;
well the brave man has found them all in&#xD;
Paris !&#xD;
"C'h~re madame! a single face, a single&#xD;
memory, is enshrined in the sanctuary of my&#xD;
heart -"&#xD;
"Mon Dieu! what a waste of space! It&#xD;
is an untenanted cathedral; St. Peter's&#xD;
with a solitary vestal at the fount!"&#xD;
"' Ich habe gelebt und geliebt,' and I re-&#xD;
main the embodiment of constancy, as I am&#xD;
the model of virtue. I am going to turn&#xD;
monk; the maroon of th~ Franciscans be-&#xD;
comes me wonderfully. Dites done, amia-&#xD;

"Behold the model of virtue who calls&#xD;

shall be a monk, all Trouville will go to a&#xD;
nunnery sans doute. Fancy the mermaid&#xD;
sisters! and in convents mirrors are de'-&#xD;

"And baccarat unknown," cried Charley,&#xD;
mischievously; "wilt thou still be a monk,&#xD;
0 man of the burdened heart?"&#xD;
"Ay, will I so, if for nothing but to&#xD;
&#xD;
t shrive and chasten sinful youth. Irrever-&#xD;

"Smiling like the great Cmsar on Marie&#xD;

"Alas! you undo me quite; is she not&#xD;
glorious, though?"&#xD;
"Magn~ftque! It was thrilling to see you,&#xD;
- an encounter of Collossi! Did she, in-&#xD;
deed, sing to you 'Dites-lui'?"&#xD;
"Ah! did she? I hear her yet!"&#xD;
£~Vivat! the mysterious one is found!&#xD;
In the amplitude of the goddess we are con-&#xD;
soled for the vastness of the temple !"&#xD;
"IIelasV' said Somers, smiling wickedly&#xD;
in his wine, "what would you have? It is&#xD;
not good to be alone, and it is sometimes&#xD;
very desolate at the Malesherbes now.&#xD;
Mais en/In! time trots to-night. ,1~aro as!"&#xD;
They came back to leave the B.u onne,&#xD;
and Somers guarded his charge so closely&#xD;
that the parting was hut a brief, stolen&#xD;
clasp, a clinging of the hand, and a whisper&#xD;
from Nina's lips, "A Dien! mon ame, situ&#xD;
incurs je te suiverais!"&#xD;
Charley resented Somers's attempt to take&#xD;
him to their quarters, however, with half-&#xD;
angry impatience, and they spent two rest-&#xD;
less hours on the Boulevard, until fatigue&#xD;
drove him home despite himself. He dread-&#xD;
ed the silence of his room and the unavoid-&#xD;
able company of his thoughts, and over&#xD;
their parlor firethicy sat late, amid he drank&#xD;
more deeply of Somers's incomparable pumich&#xD;
than that worthy willingly permitted.&#xD;
There was no moving him, and Somers,&#xD;
stealing a few hours' sleep upon a eanape',&#xD;
after a vain injunction to him to do the&#xD;
same, closed his eyes with a last waking&#xD;
recollection of the young man still sitting by&#xD;
the fire and gazing moodily at the coals.&#xD;
It had come to him at last, as it comes to all,&#xD;
the shock of arrest; the pause in the wild,&#xD;
mad whirl, when thought and memory step&#xD;
like twin giants in the path and bar the&#xD;
headlong course. Wine and light and the&#xD;
feverish cheer of the evening, even the&#xD;
still powerful spell of passion, were power-&#xD;
less to stay the flood of thoughts that seethed&#xD;
in his brain, as the hours of this night, his&#xD;
last, perhaps, on earth, rolled away. And&#xD;
down among the glowing coals he saw&#xD;
forms and faces rise and smile, and weep&#xD;
and fade away, - forms and faces of those&#xD;
days which seemed so far away, so hope-&#xD;
lessly gone, but which rolled backward now&#xD;
in a tide to the man, who, with all his seven-&#xD;
and-twenty years of life, was still the gentle-&#xD;
hearted, motherless boy to whom the better&#xD;
memories of the past were the only treas-&#xD;

ures he had not squandered. Solemn, sor-&#xD;
rowful images, viewed with regretful, hope-&#xD;
less eyes.&#xD;
"Had life meant only this for him? Was&#xD;
it, indeed, all gone, so soon? and it hail&#xD;
been so empty and so weary! It mattered&#xD;
little. Who would remember him? The&#xD;
outcast, the self-destroyed! .... And she!"&#xD;
Then, as when a boy, long, long years be-&#xD;
fore, he wept silent, streaming tears blind-&#xD;
ing him to the images in the fire, until the&#xD;
weary brain grew numb ~nd cold to every&#xD;
sharper feeling, leaving him bowed and&#xD;
hopeless, but sleepless still.&#xD;
Somers, aroused by instinct while it was&#xD;
still barely light, stared despondently at&#xD;
the unchanged figure before the dead fire.&#xD;
A suspicion even flashed through his mind&#xD;
at the first glimpse of the bent form, with&#xD;
the head looked in the hands; but he dis-&#xD;
missed it on the instant, and got up briskly&#xD;
to his feet.&#xD;
"Nearly seven! We 'ye no time to lose.&#xD;
It remains to be seen if Fritz has obeyed&#xD;
orders about the coffee. I ought to scold&#xD;
you for sitting there like another Tony all&#xD;
nicrht. Slept any?"&#xD;
~' No, I think not."&#xD;
Somers started at the tone, and looked&#xD;
at him again rather s~iarply. The coffee&#xD;
came in at the moment, and he burnt the&#xD;
cups over with Cognac. Charley took&#xD;
his listlessly, and failed to respond, by any&#xD;
change of manner, to Somers's efforts to&#xD;
arouse him, until the latter was fairly bro-&#xD;
ken down by discouragement, not unmixed&#xD;
with a certain dread.&#xD;
"I say, old fellow," he cried, putting his&#xD;
hand on Charley's shoulder, "you 're not&#xD;
going to the ground in this sort of mood,&#xD;
are you? You know me and my way,&#xD;
Char Icy; if you don't ~'?&#xD;
He hesitated now, as the young man's&#xD;
eyes met his with a look in them he had&#xD;
never seen before, one that he was power-&#xD;
less to decipher. Then Chanley got up&#xD;
steadily enough, though he sighed as he&#xD;
did so.&#xD;
"Let us go now," he said.&#xD;
The long ride was a silent one. Somers&#xD;
was nonplussed, but no longer troubled&#xD;
with the discomforting thought that had&#xD;
arisen over their coffee. Whatever his&#xD;
companion's manner might cover, it was&#xD;
something in which hesitation or weakness&#xD;
had ~ro part; he saw that very quickly, and&#xD;
said no more. As their eoupd turned from~&#xD;
the Boulevards into the Place du Trone,&#xD;
another, which had evidently stood in wait-&#xD;
ing in the angle of Rue de Faubourg Saint&#xD;
Antoine, followed in rapid pursuit, but at a&#xD;
certain distance, and drew up discreetly in&#xD;
an unnoticed byway of the Bois, as the&#xD;
gentlemen in advance left their convey-&#xD;
ance. Its occupants were the l3aronne,&#xD;
&#xD;
worn and pale with sleepless suffering, and&#xD;
the faithful Henriette.&#xD;
They found the other party on the ground,&#xD;
and also Vasour, who had arrived by a third&#xD;
cab. Martini, cold and smiling, bowed pro-&#xD;
foundly to the new-corners, and shrugging&#xD;
his shoulders impatiently, with a curse at&#xD;
the rawness of the air, suc9c~ested despatch.&#xD;
Chancy lost none of his 'l~'stlessness in the&#xD;
brief interim of pacing the ground, and re-&#xD;
ceived his weapon in silence from Somers.&#xD;
"Cool is the word, old fellow," s~dd the&#xD;
latter, a little nervous at the last.&#xD;
The fall of Somers's handkerchief and&#xD;
the reports were simultaneous; and though&#xD;
Chancy's was only too evidently a careless&#xD;
delivery, the Italian staggered wildly, and&#xD;
the pistol fell from his hand; the ball had&#xD;
sunk deep in his shoulder. Charley was&#xD;
unhurt.&#xD;
All the fury of his nature surged into the&#xD;
Neapolitan's face under the sharp agony&#xD;
of his wound, and he called frantically for&#xD;
another weapon. The protestations of both&#xD;
seconds, as well as of Vasoun, who declared&#xD;
the injury to be serious and to require in-&#xD;
stant attention, were vain. He was de-&#xD;
moniacal in his violence, and, snatching a&#xD;
second pistol from the officer's grasp with&#xD;
his remaining hand, yelled to Charley to&#xD;
taj~e his place. Somers covered him with&#xD;
a loaded weapon in a flash, and hurled a&#xD;
tremendous oath at him, with an injunction&#xD;
that fell on deaf ears.&#xD;
"Give me your pistol," said Charley,&#xD;
quietly.&#xD;
"But - it's hellish! I won't have you&#xD;
murdered!" cried Somers, in whom the&#xD;
sleepy lion was fully aroused.&#xD;
"He will faint before he can fire," said&#xD;
Vasour, in a loud whisper.&#xD;
"En garde!" screamed the Italian again,&#xD;
livid with rage and pain.&#xD;
Chancy stepped to the mark and levelled&#xD;
his weapon, while Somers reluctantly drew&#xD;
his handkerchief. He had barely got it&#xD;
out when Martini fired in advance of the&#xD;
signal. Somers gave a great cry as Char-&#xD;
ley started slightly; but the young man&#xD;
recovered himself in an instant, and low-&#xD;
ered his arm without firing, as his opponent&#xD;
reeled to the ground in a swoon.&#xD;
"My God! are you hit?" cried Som-&#xD;
ers, coming up, and shaking like a leaf.&#xD;
"A scratch, I think, - here," replied&#xD;
Charley, putting his hand to his head,&#xD;
Nothing more, by the grace of Heaven;&#xD;
the merest graze of the temple, and a little&#xD;
groove among the thick, short curls; a&#xD;
shade deeper, and the letters in Somers's&#xD;
pocket must have gone to their destinations.&#xD;
There was a big lump in that worthy's&#xD;
throat and a mist in his blue eyes, as he&#xD;
wiped the few drops of blood from Charley's&#xD;
forehead.&#xD;

ON THE MOIYNTAIN-SIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
it the azure ocean shimmers in the sunlight,&#xD;
like a vast wave of velvet edged with gold.&#xD;
A world of nature framed in one dazzling&#xD;
scene, where all climes and seasons blend&#xD;
together; where the cold rocks look down&#xD;
on blooming vales, and the stately palm-&#xD;
tree on the shore waves a languid salute to&#xD;
the rugged pine above; where the worn'&#xD;
man, broken in the struggle in some sunless&#xD;
land, sits down in the shadow of the fig-tree&#xD;
and draws fresh life from the salted air,&#xD;
while far away he may catch a cold glimpse&#xD;
of winter, and his thoughts fly homeward to&#xD;
the ungracious but ever-dear corner of the&#xD;
world from whence he comes; where old,&#xD;
odd forms of life linger in curious preser-&#xD;
vation, and unwritten history teems with&#xD;
strange traditions and the dim legends of&#xD;
three thousand years; where the sea-going&#xD;
Greek, the stern Prietorian, the half-naked&#xD;
Goth, and the dark-eyed Saracen succes-&#xD;
sively have trod, and left in turn their im-&#xD;
press on the dweller and the land.&#xD;
Centuries of patient toil have ribbed the&#xD;
steep hills with terrace walls, until every&#xD;
mountain is like some giant's flight of steps,&#xD;
bordered and girt with wonderful old ranges&#xD;
of olive-trees whose ages may not be told.&#xD;
And fiu~ up, where only the eagle flies and&#xD;
broken masses of stone scorch in the sun, -&#xD;
in hidden crevices of the hills, where the&#xD;
few trees are shrunken things, and the vine&#xD;
grows short and thick and knotted in the&#xD;
cloud damps, - are little fairy villages&#xD;
reached only by hours of patient climbing.&#xD;
One sees there the antique type of the&#xD;
Latin in the strong-limbed men and hardy,&#xD;
gray-eyed women, whose forgotten ances-&#xD;
tors fled the shores, and from their secret&#xD;
nooks aloft looked down with watchful gaze&#xD;
upon the turbaned rover in his fleet ship.&#xD;
How they have lived on those wild peaks&#xD;
through all the cheerless winters of eight&#xD;
hundred years, how increased and thrive&#xD;
and preserved the stern integrity of the Li-&#xD;
gurian blood, constitutes a weird chapter of&#xD;
the past which no pen has added to written&#xD;
history. But like the eagles, who are their&#xD;
mates, no charm can tempt them from their&#xD;
airy heigbts and the bright picture on which&#xD;
they look down.&#xD;
The air in this land is full of beauty and&#xD;
mystery and silence, the land itself a worn&#xD;
and many-lettered page whose ancient char-&#xD;
acters we puzzle over but cannot read. We&#xD;
stand in the old beaten path of changing&#xD;
races who crept aroundd the sea-girt Alps,&#xD;
age after age, in the ever restless spirit of&#xD;
conquest, and marked it in their several&#xD;
fashions. With the roadside dweller on the&#xD;
shore, Gaul and Ligurian, Greek, Roman,&#xD;
and Moor, and the blond barbarian of the&#xD;
North, were in turn the victorious guests;&#xD;
and in the crabbed dialect of to-day, which&#xD;
defies all but a native tongue, we may still&#xD;
&#xD;
find traces of them all. Tradition fades&#xD;
with the Saracen; but hewn stone and&#xD;
crumbling monuments tell of the Augustan&#xD;
legions, and a dim but fixed antiquity points&#xD;
to the bold navigator of the Pira~us long&#xD;
before them.&#xD;
Here the wounded of the nations gather,&#xD;
and in the infinite charm which hangs&#xD;
about the historic hills find a rare auxiliary&#xD;
to the health-giving climate, which relieves&#xD;
the weary probation of the invalid in the&#xD;
long winter months. For Emma Howlana&#xD;
the study possessed a pleasure that was&#xD;
simply intense; and for her also there was&#xD;
a balm in the air which promised well to&#xD;
restore the rose to her cheeks. Once estab-&#xD;
lished ia their pretty villa by the sea, ("for&#xD;
all the worl~1 like a cottage of terra-cotta,"&#xD;
wrote Miss Clare to an envious friend,&#xD;
"with suck a sweet name - they are all&#xD;
named, you know, - fancy, 'Villa Sperhn-&#xD;
za'! ") and the quiet routine of Mentone&#xD;
life fairly begun, the days and weeks sped&#xD;
swiftly in a sunny dream; and even to&#xD;
those of the party in full health, for whom&#xD;
the new life was in such marked contrast to&#xD;
their gay winters at home, the change was&#xD;
fraught with a delh~ious, restful enjoyment&#xD;
that left no room for regret. Clare was ex-&#xD;
ultant, and entered into the business of ~x-&#xD;
cursions with a keen zest. There was no&#xD;
pause in her enthusiastic career until the&#xD;
summits of the Aiguille and Grandmondo&#xD;
had been duly scaled, the eerie hamlet of&#xD;
Sar~ta Agnesa visited, and the general&#xD;
topography of the five inland valleys learned&#xD;
by heart. She had ridden every donkey in&#xD;
the place, and knew their several names&#xD;
and natures, and shouted "Esa! "in broad&#xD;
patois to those that behaved ill, and "13u-&#xD;
ono!" to those that behaved well, quite as&#xD;
vociferously as old Mariana, the "donkey-&#xD;
woman," and much more musically. She&#xD;
had long since ceased to regard a scramble&#xD;
of the docile beasts around some dizzy turn,&#xD;
where a misstep was death, as anything&#xD;
more than a mild exhilaration, and had&#xD;
once ventured a gallop down a steep incline&#xD;
to the abject terror of the beholders, na-&#xD;
tive and ~foreign.&#xD;
Having run through the list of possible ex-&#xD;
cursions, she lapsed rather indolently under&#xD;
the growing warmth of the last winter month&#xD;
into the quieter employment that engrossed&#xD;
Emma's attention, and became her lazy&#xD;
companion in the ever-delightful foot ram-&#xD;
bles and expeditions of a botanical and&#xD;
artistic nature, the fruits of which accu-&#xD;
mulated in fern-albums and sketch-books.&#xD;
The winter had quite broken, and the&#xD;
days were growing rapidly longer and&#xD;
brighter, if possible, when Huntley, with-&#xD;
out warning, made his smiling appearance&#xD;
at the villa. He was received with a burst&#xD;
of joyous welcome, such' as only those&#xD;

ON THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
he caught at that happy token and no&#xD;
lop'rer feared failure.&#xD;
he was a famous accession to their circle,&#xD;
this wonderful man of the world. He in-&#xD;
fused new life into their slightly tedious&#xD;
routine, and brought his rare cleverness&#xD;
and versatility to bear effectively on all&#xD;
its details, from the more serious questions&#xD;
of a sanitary nature down to the simple&#xD;
process of drying a fern-leaf. He demol-&#xD;
ished the proud structure of Miss Clare's&#xD;
conceit at one fell blow, by discovering no&#xD;
less than three new specimens of ferns&#xD;
among the hills, long after she had sighed&#xD;
like Alexander over the exhausted field;&#xD;
and he was the especial admiration of that&#xD;
young lady, when, in knickerbockers and&#xD;
Tyrol blouse, he scrambled up the roughest&#xD;
precipices and ravaged impracticable crevi-&#xD;
ces f6r the early primroses and anemones.&#xD;
Then he introduced a new and delightful&#xD;
feature into their amusements by hunting&#xD;
up the least cumbersome of the fishing-&#xD;
craft, overhauling it neatly, and rigging it&#xD;
'with a pretty lateen sail; in this they made&#xD;
the merriest little voyages to the Bordighera&#xD;
Point and Monaco, and even Villefranche&#xD;
harbor, t~nd got as brown as the "lemon-&#xD;
girls" on the sunny sea. And in the eyen-&#xD;
ings, after the "sunset chill" was gone, it&#xD;
was simply blissful to sit in the little bal-&#xD;
cony over the beach, with the fisher-folk,&#xD;
men and women, pulling forever at the far-&#xD;
away nets, and chanting forever that self-&#xD;
same song:-&#xD;
"Mariannina comme chuagne&#xD;
ca s' ~ rotta la lancella!&#xD;
come fa la puverella&#xD;
Quanno 1' eequa a da tir~!&#xD;
Quanno 1' acquft a da tira!&#xD;
Quanno 1' acqua a ~Ia mira!&#xD;
Mariani sciasciona mia!&#xD;
Lassa a chub e piglia a me!"&#xD;
with the moonlight turning all the sea to&#xD;
silver, and Mr. Huntley, gathering inspira-&#xD;
tion from the scene, feeding his hungry lis-&#xD;
teners with a thousand curious reminiscences&#xD;
of that sea itself, and the far lands beyond.&#xD;
In advance, indeed, of their eagerly an-&#xD;
ticipated Italian tour, he wellnigh familiar-&#xD;
ized them with the marvels of that storied&#xD;
land, as well as of those which they &amp;amp;ould&#xD;
not hope to visit. There was n6ne he had&#xD;
not visited, studied, it would seem; and he&#xD;
knew well how to invest his recollections of&#xD;
them with that charm of description which&#xD;
has led many an innocent -traveller to&#xD;
grievous disappointment, and to which the&#xD;
vieux router listens with a smile and is not&#xD;
deceived.&#xD;
The appreciative Clare quite lost her&#xD;
heart to the charmer, and rhapsodized fer-&#xD;
vidly over his surpassing fascinations.&#xD;
"Is n't he splendid?" she said to Emma&#xD;
a score of times, adding once, with a little&#xD;
teasing laugh, "I am half in lbve with him&#xD;
&#xD;
myself. I should be quite if- if he were&#xD;
not 'spoke for' I"&#xD;
Whereupon Emmablushed painfully, but&#xD;
laughed also, or tried to do so, as she bent&#xD;
low over her sketch-book.&#xD;
"You darling goose I Do you know,"&#xD;
continued the impulsive girl, on whose un-&#xD;
flagging elasticity the soft, semi-tropical cli-&#xD;
mate had proved almost powerless, "you&#xD;
are becoming awfully handsome? You are,&#xD;
indeed; you never looked so well in your&#xD;
life, and it 's my only consolation that the&#xD;
sun has made you almost as black as I&#xD;
am!"&#xD;
Huntley would have used, a better word&#xD;
than "handsome," when, one afternoon sonic&#xD;
days later, they stood together on the high&#xD;
shoulder of the Corniche Road, beyond the&#xD;
Pont Saint Louis, waiting for the others,&#xD;
who were climbing up from the Red Rocks&#xD;
below with much unnecessary clamor.&#xD;
Emma had mounted upon a block of stone&#xD;
and was looking sown at the stragglers,&#xD;
laughing merrily at their laborious advance,&#xD;
and especiallyat Clare and her sister, who&#xD;
were "racing" fiir the top, and whose pro-&#xD;
gress was marked by a desperate disregard&#xD;
of life and limb, as ludicrous as it was excit-&#xD;
ing. Emma had taken off her hat as she&#xD;
stood there, and the smart sea-breeze, waft-&#xD;
ing aside her splendid hair (which Clare&#xD;
that morning had decided was "too beauti-&#xD;
ful" to be "done up," and which fell in&#xD;
golden luxuriance to her waist), showed the&#xD;
cheek, once more full and rounded, man-&#xD;
tling with rich color, an(l dimpled with&#xD;
merriment; and Huntley's soul was in his&#xD;
eyes as he gazed covertly upon the lovely&#xD;
face.&#xD;
A travelling vetlura was toiling up the as-&#xD;
cent, its four stout horses puffing in the hot&#xD;
sun, and the driver in front emulating the&#xD;
noisy dog upon the mountain of luggage be-&#xD;
hind by maintaining a steady volley of mu-&#xD;
sical "Ye-oups!" and an ear-piercing snap-&#xD;
ping of his whip. Of its two occupants one,&#xD;
a lady, was indolently conning a book; the&#xD;
other, a gentleman, as indolently blinking&#xD;
at the dimpled sea far down below. He&#xD;
had just caught sight of the gay party of&#xD;
climbers, and seemed about to call the at-&#xD;
tention of his companion to them, when the&#xD;
two figures on the hill-top met his eye, and&#xD;
he paused in the movement, while the smile&#xD;
died suddenly from his face. Even at that&#xD;
distance a thrill of recognition shocked him,&#xD;
and he shrank back in his corner with coin-&#xD;
pressed lips; but he never withdrew his&#xD;
gaze from the two who stood by the road-&#xD;
side, and whom the travellers wem slowly&#xD;
approaching. Once, indeed, he looked&#xD;
about quickly, as if thinking of escape, and&#xD;
his eye lingered a moment upon the unused&#xD;
sunshade on the seat before him; but he&#xD;
only clenched his hands after it, and settled&#xD;

CHlOISY.&#xD;
&#xD;
himself' with an air of desperation in his&#xD;
place, while a stri4en, suffering look over-&#xD;
spread his features.&#xD;
It was all in an instant; the carriage&#xD;
passed just behind the strollers, but south-&#xD;
ward-bound travellers were too common on&#xD;
that one great road to Rome to excite much&#xD;
curiosity, and Iluntley, who had glanced at&#xD;
it when it was still distant, had become&#xD;
suddenly interested in a just visible sail,&#xD;
and was scanning it through his glass.&#xD;
Emma alone turned as the carriage passed,&#xD;
an(l met the great brown eyes she knew so&#xD;
well; th~re were no others like them in the&#xD;
world. She started with a stifled cry, and&#xD;
her hand went to her heart; but the next&#xD;
minute the vehicle had gained the ridge and&#xD;
went thundering down the Ventimiglia side&#xD;
at a gallop. She could have screamed then,&#xD;
and in the first bewildering impulse sped&#xD;
after it as after the last departing hope of&#xD;
her life; but that swift, strained glance&#xD;
which had recognized her cousin, pale, star-&#xD;
tled, strangely altered, she thought., and&#xD;
staring at her with hollow eyes, had taken&#xD;
in as well the handsome, unconscious wo-&#xD;
man, reclining indolently by his side. She&#xD;
was paralyzed for the instant; breath, sense,&#xD;
everything but sight, seemed gone; but I&#xD;
when the reaction came, the memory of that&#xD;
woman s face gave her strength to repress&#xD;
the cry that had sprung to her lips. While&#xD;
Huntley remained intent on the sail, she&#xD;
struggled to calm the tumult of her heart;&#xD;
luckily he did not observe or address her&#xD;
for some time, and a little later he went 1&#xD;
down the hillside a few steps to give his&#xD;
hand to the panting Clare. Then Emma I&#xD;
ran breathlessly into the road, and, after a&#xD;
moment's search, gathered a little book from&#xD;
the dust, and hid it in her dress. She had I&#xD;
seen it fall, and marked the place, and was&#xD;
fortunate enough to gain it unseen.&#xD;
On the way home she was absent and&#xD;
constrained, and Huntley noticed it uneasi-&#xD;
ly, the more uneasily because she was also&#xD;
pale.&#xD;
"I fear you have walked too far, AMiss 1&#xD;
Emma; will you let me go for a panier?"&#xD;
"0 no; it is nothing, just the least head-&#xD;
ache. Please excuse me if I am stupid." a&#xD;
He understood, and kept silence to the&#xD;
villa, but he was discumforted. Once there t&#xD;
and in her room, she examined the book I&#xD;
with eager, trembling hands and hungry i&#xD;
eyes. It was a pretty liUou copy of focelyn, t&#xD;
and on the fly-leaf was an inscription f&#xD;
wreathed in a delicate border of ivy-leaves, a&#xD;
the whole in pencil and by what artist-hand s&#xD;
she knew only too well: -               b&#xD;
NINA CHOISY, Vallat, Switzerland, Au- ~&#xD;
gust, 186-.&#xD;
The date was seven months old! She&#xD;
studied it long and silently, while the tears v&#xD;
gathered slowly in her eyes; then. she ~i&#xD;
&#xD;
kissed it where his hand had set its mark, -&#xD;
what was the name to her, since the char-&#xD;
acters were his? and hid i~ away. Theim&#xD;
she sat in her window-corner and wept&#xD;
quietly.&#xD;
Clare came in, and, after a quick glance of&#xD;
surprise, tumbled on her knees beside the&#xD;
silent girL&#xD;
"What is it, darling?" she asked, peering&#xD;
up into Emma's face with the black eyes&#xD;
which were always so sensitive to the influ-&#xD;
ence of tears, and never more so than now.&#xD;
"Nothing, dear; or only a little thing&#xD;
which I will tell you by and by. Don't tell&#xD;
the mamma, will you? It is the last, the&#xD;
very last time!"&#xD;
Clare's eyes overflowed at the melancholy&#xD;
cadence of the last words.&#xD;
"Tell me, dear, was it Mn Huntley -"&#xD;
"No, no! I will tell you, but not now.&#xD;
Don't ask me, please. There, I am going&#xD;
to be good again; promise that you won't&#xD;
speak of it, Clare, there 's a good girl, and&#xD;
go and dress for dinner."&#xD;
Two days later Emma found herself&#xD;
alone with Mr. Huntley,- under the pines&#xD;
of the Cap Martin; the others were career-&#xD;
ing wildly far ahead in pursuit of an un-&#xD;
happy butterfly, with much uproar and a&#xD;
mad flourish of gauze nets.&#xD;
"Mr. Huntley," she said, suddenly, "I&#xD;
irish to ask you a question."&#xD;
ile had marked her closely for these two&#xD;
lays, and noted a new and alarming preoc-&#xD;
~upation in her manner. It alarmed him&#xD;
because he could not understand it or dis-&#xD;
~ern it~ cause, and nothing so tried him as&#xD;
:he intangible. His heart sank at these&#xD;
~v'ords, for no visible reason, - how he&#xD;
miled afterwards when he recalled it! -&#xD;
)ut he said quickly, "It is always a pleas-.&#xD;
ire, Miss Emma."&#xD;
"But this is a strange question, perhaps;&#xD;
lo you know who 'Nina Choisy' is?"&#xD;
"Nina Choisy I - do I? - yes - that&#xD;
s -" He was absolutely at fault.&#xD;
"I see you do. Don't fear to tell me, Mr.&#xD;
luntley. I know all."&#xD;
- you know all?"&#xD;
"Yes, only tell me, Mr.~Huntley, is he -&#xD;
~re they married?"&#xD;
She asked the question with an effort,&#xD;
hough in all innocence. Evidently, thought&#xD;
luntley, who was struggling~ hard for bear-&#xD;
ugs, she did not "know alP." His hesita1-&#xD;
ion was marked, but she did not notice it,&#xD;
bough she hung on the answer. He said,&#xD;
t last, with a flash in his eyes she did not&#xD;
ce, "No, bat I believe they are going to&#xD;
e. Pardon me, Miss Emma; I thought,&#xD;
re all thought, that it would be painful,&#xD;
perhaps - Mrs. Jennings -"&#xD;
"You are all too good to me. I-I am&#xD;
ery glad of it, Mr. Huntley. I hope he&#xD;
nIl be very happy; do you not also? There&#xD;

&#xD;
I meant to be brave about it I am not&#xD;
very, am I ?" She was trying to smile&#xD;
gayly, but two telltale tears had broken&#xD;
bounds on her cheeks.&#xD;
"Miss Emma," said her companion, so-&#xD;
berly, and his voice seemed to tremble a&#xD;
little, "you are the noblest woman I have&#xD;
ever known; I cannot tell you how I honor&#xD;
you.~~&#xD;
"Thank you, but I don't deserve that&#xD;
praise. Shall we turn back now? I see&#xD;
they have gone around. 1 will explain how&#xD;
I discovered this."&#xD;
She did so, while he listened, gravely,&#xD;
and winced a little when he learned she had&#xD;
seen her cousin. He was very guarded in&#xD;
any further mention of Charley, and hurried&#xD;
at once to communicate with Mrs. Jen-&#xD;
nings.&#xD;
"She asked me if they were married. It&#xD;
was terribly awkward, and I was absolutely&#xD;
at a loss. I said, after some hesitation,&#xD;
which must have seemed strange, that they&#xD;
were going to be." Mrs. Jennings did not&#xD;
like the deception, simply because it was a&#xD;
deception. As for Chancy, she had quite&#xD;
thrown him over, and thought Emma: now&#xD;
could bear the whole truth. But Huntley&#xD;
clung to the fraud. "It is scarcely a decep-&#xD;
tion," he said quickly, a little impatiently&#xD;
she thought;" I have the best authority for&#xD;
assuring you that it is a conclusion which&#xD;
may occur any day, and which is practically&#xD;
inevitable, soon or late."&#xD;
"Yon seem to be informed," said the&#xD;
lady, with some curiosity.&#xD;
"His intimate friend at r~fis is an old&#xD;
acquaintance of' my own, to whom I gave&#xD;
him letters, Through Somers I hear of him,&#xD;
and through him also I have made more&#xD;
than one effort to reach Chariey, as you&#xD;
may believe. He has resented them one&#xD;
and all."&#xD;
"It 's a pity his 'intimate' and your 'ac-&#xD;
quaintance' could not have exercised a little&#xD;
restraint over him," said Mrs. Jennings,&#xD;
with a slight elevation of the brows. "I&#xD;
have had to hide my 'Galignani' for a&#xD;
week past. You saw it, of course."&#xD;
"I read of a duel, - cela va dans l'addi-&#xD;
lion, - and it accounts for his flight through&#xD;
here. No one regrets his course more deep-&#xD;
ly than I do, and no one, perhaps, so well&#xD;
knows thd utter futility of attempting to ar-&#xD;
rest it. It must reach its goal, as it will,&#xD;
in marriage. Her husband lives only&#xD;
from day to day, cannot possibly live lono,&#xD;
and the future is clear to my mind, it&#xD;
would not be well, surely, to embitter Miss&#xD;
Emma's affectionate memories of her cousin&#xD;
at such a time, when to-morrow may amend&#xD;
his fault in the world's eyes, and put him&#xD;
precisely in the position where she now im-&#xD;
agines him. I cannot but think it would&#xD;
be unwise, if not cruel, to do it."&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Jennings did not argue further&#xD;
was quite sure now as to the issue of&#xD;
ley's suit, and accepted it as inevitab&#xD;
any case. The deception - for, despi&#xD;
words, a deception she felt it to be&#xD;
repugnant to her; but in view of the&#xD;
which now seemed assured, she stifled t1~e~&#xD;
small whisper of conscience, and held her&#xD;
peace.&#xD;
Baronne Nina, startled by the sudden in-&#xD;
crease of speed, as the vetturino lashed his&#xD;
horses into a run down the hill, had given a&#xD;
little nervous spring which sent the book in&#xD;
her hand unnoticed over the si(le, and&#xD;
caught Charley's arm.' "Mon Dieu! how&#xD;
the animal drives!" The next moment&#xD;
her eyes fell on the face of her companion,&#xD;
and noted the change there in alarm.&#xD;
"Qu'as-tu, che'rie?" she asked, quickly,&#xD;
catching his hand as she spoke. What lie&#xD;
"had" at that instant was a dull "wonder"&#xD;
if a leap over the dizzy precipice along&#xD;
which they were now whirling was not&#xD;
preferable to such a life as his had become.&#xD;
Fur the first time h'e drew his hand quickly&#xD;
away froni her with a half-recoil. that sent a&#xD;
chill to her heart. "Mais, qu'as-tu? you&#xD;
are ill, dear; we will go back to Mentone."&#xD;
"No ! no ! " he said, excitedly; but calm-&#xD;
ing himself quickly, he forced a laugh. "I&#xD;
had a bad (lream, pet; was it a dream? I&#xD;
wonder -"&#xD;
"What? what are you talking of?"&#xD;
" What? I don't know, I 'in sure. I was&#xD;
asleep, I think. Where do we stay to-&#xD;
night, did you say?"&#xD;
"Me! I did not say, I don't even know.&#xD;
Oneilly or something like; you are a little&#xD;
stupi(i, bbe'; you arrangetl it all your-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"So I did, I remember now. How lovely&#xD;
it is!"&#xD;
And because it was so lovely, he leaned&#xD;
back wearily and closed his eyes. She&#xD;
watched him with a troubled face, and&#xD;
marked his contracted brow and twitching&#xD;
lips in genuine concern. Once she caught&#xD;
a muttered name. tie opened his eyes&#xD;
presently, and found her watching him.&#xD;
" Who is ' Iluntley '2" she asked, curtly.&#xD;
He stared at her an instant, and then smiled&#xD;
an u4leasant smile. "My cousin, pet, or&#xD;
going to be!"&#xD;
Strange that his words should be the&#xD;
same as those of the cunning tongue of&#xD;
Huntley himself two days later, "going to&#xD;
be"!&#xD;
Nina did not recover from her alarm that&#xD;
day or the next, or for many. A spirit of&#xD;
recklessness, of desperation even, seemed to&#xD;
have taken possession of Chancy, which&#xD;
she was powerless to control. He began&#xD;

new-coiner at the Hotel Choisy,&#xD;
who had so far attracted the attention of&#xD;
our hero as to provoke the inquiry recorded&#xD;
in the last chapter, was, as Somers had said,&#xD;
an old family intimate of the D'Alencourts.&#xD;
The elder D orion had been a brother in&#xD;
arms with the Colonel, and, dying in Africa,&#xD;
had sent his orphaned boy to France some&#xD;
years after the Colonel's return, with a last&#xD;
message begging the good offices of the&#xD;
friend in his child's behalf. Though the&#xD;
boy had a home among his father's kindred&#xD;
at Lyons, he spent much of his early life at&#xD;
the chateau of the D'Alencourts, and there&#xD;
had been a firm and rather tender alliance&#xD;
between the little Nina and the dark-eyed&#xD;
Gustave. Through the Colonel's patronage&#xD;
the boy was sent to St. Maur at Paris when&#xD;
he was still in the season of sand-pies and&#xD;
pain de sucre, and Nina a demure and di-&#xD;
minutive little body of six years' growth.&#xD;
They met but seldom afterwards, though&#xD;
often enough to preserve the simple entente&#xD;
cordial of their childhood. He was away&#xD;
on service during the brief interval between&#xD;
Nina's withdrawal from the seminaire at&#xD;
Paris and her marriage, and did not appear&#xD;
to renew the ancient acquaintance until she&#xD;
was the established lady du monde of the&#xD;
Boulevard Monceaux.&#xD;
It might be said that no marked emotion&#xD;
was awakened in the bosom of the gallant&#xD;
spahi by the news of her marriage, which&#xD;
&#xD;
reached him in due course through the mess-&#xD;
gdssip, by Afric's sunny mountains. He&#xD;
smiled slightly when he recalled the well.&#xD;
remembered spectre of Chateau Choisy;&#xD;
but was apparently disposed to regard the&#xD;
match with a certain degree of approval,&#xD;
as his thoughts foreshadowed something&#xD;
very like the state of things which after-&#xD;
wards existed at the gay Ho a Paris.&#xD;
lie pledged the happy pair in a beaker of&#xD;
foaming Seltzer warmed with the cognac&#xD;
of Cette, and wjis glad to think that he&#xD;
might some day meet the blooming Nina at&#xD;
a certain advantage in the world. Nor was&#xD;
he disappointed in this regard, as whenever&#xD;
afterwards he enjoyed an opportunity of&#xD;
basking in the hospitable glow of the Ba-&#xD;
ronne's town-heuse, his heart had been&#xD;
cheered by manifestations of great friendli-&#xD;
ness on the part of the mistress, and his&#xD;
pride more than gratified by a marked rec-&#xD;
ognition of his personal merits. Truth to&#xD;
tell, Monsieur Gustave was a commendable&#xD;
specimen of his kind. In appearance he&#xD;
was the beau ideal of the French soldier,&#xD;
and had already won honorable mention in&#xD;
desert strife; and in his circle he ruled&#xD;
first favorite by virtue of rare good-natm'e&#xD;
and that insouciant dash which is the dis-&#xD;
tinguishing charm of the military scape-&#xD;
grace. Nina liked him immensely. He&#xD;
amused her, and sharing a perfect under-&#xD;
standing, which rendered mistakes impossi-&#xD;
ble, they had even beguiled themselves with&#xD;
some thoroughly amiable and thoroughly&#xD;
unmeaning flirtation. It was edifying be-&#xD;
yond words when the handsome soldier af-&#xD;
f~mcted a pale and sickly melancholy, and&#xD;
dwelt with sweet sadness on the cruel issue&#xD;
'of their lives, so lovingly twined at the be-&#xD;
ginning, so ruthlessly torn apart, etc., etc.&#xD;
Nina could listen with sympathetic solem-&#xD;
nity, but would hint at the end that the&#xD;
whisper of the 'world led her to believe he&#xD;
had found much consolation in the usual&#xD;
sources; whereupon there would be smiles&#xD;
and "qac vualez-vou~'s?" and cigarrettes&#xD;
Laferme.&#xD;
He had resented the conquest of the&#xD;
"barbarian of the West," however, had the&#xD;
noble soldier, and swore a round oath in&#xD;
the seclusion of his quarters, when the&#xD;
amazing news reached him in due course of&#xD;
correspondence. It was a reflection on the&#xD;
national prestige~ on his own personal re-&#xD;
pute as a winsome knight, and a shattering&#xD;
blow to his amour propre; and though the&#xD;
fires of his wrath burned suiphurously for a&#xD;
time without disastrous consequences, he&#xD;
finally asked a leave and crossed the llIag-&#xD;
num in a belligerent state of mind. When&#xD;
he appeared on the scene, soon after the re-&#xD;
turn of the party from italy, it was with a&#xD;
chivalrous resolution to oppose the present&#xD;
state of affairs at any cost. He proved&#xD;
&#xD;
more a Deus ex macidna than in his simple or, if he did, it was only to feel a certain&#xD;
soul he had dreamt of being.           pleasure in the addition to the habitue's at&#xD;

&#xD;
absence, - days of which it would have puz-&#xD;
zled him sorely to give account, - entering&#xD;
the salon at a late hour on a stormy March&#xD;
night. A few callers only had braved the&#xD;
tempest of the streets for the goal of warmth&#xD;
and luxury in those gilded parlors. Ma-&#xD;
dame Grandoic was seated at whist with a&#xD;
select t;rio of her own favorites, - elderly&#xD;
gentlemen of a studiously military poise, due&#xD;
mainly to latent whalebone, - and most&#xD;
of the others had made the game the centre&#xD;
of their revolutions. Chancy missed the&#xD;
Baronne, but as he passed into the inner&#xD;
salon he heard her short laugh from the&#xD;
conservatory beyond; it ran at right angles&#xD;
with the room, and at the same instant, in&#xD;
the large mirror which filled an opposite&#xD;
space, he caught the full reflection of an in-&#xD;
teresting tableau which caused him to pause&#xD;
sud(henlv in his advance.&#xD;
It is to be presumed that the gallant Lieu-&#xD;
tenant, in view of the fact that his short&#xD;
leave expired this vei'y night, felt himself&#xD;
justly entitled to some slight token of grati-&#xD;
tude for time part he lately sustained with,&#xD;
it must be owned, admirable art. Em-&#xD;
boldened by the consciousness of desert, he&#xD;
had seized the opportunity in the conserva-&#xD;
tory to speak plaintively of his forced flight&#xD;
on the morrow; and Nina looked soberly at&#xD;
him as he spoke, thimiking not of him, but of&#xD;
certain matters as yet unaccomplished and&#xD;
to the furtherance of which his assistance&#xD;
seemed essential. There was danger in&#xD;
the glance, however; Monsieur Dorion quite&#xD;
mistook its nature, which was the more nat-&#xD;
ural since lie was French and a large&#xD;
drinker of wine at dinner; he caught both&#xD;
her hands in his with a quick, strong grasp,&#xD;
amid, before she could make a niovement to&#xD;
resist him, drew her close and kissed her&#xD;
cheeks one after the other.&#xD;
This was the. picture Chancy saw; and&#xD;
seeing it he swung around on his heel with&#xD;
something like a smothered oath.&#xD;
An instant later the Baronne brushed&#xD;
past him with a flaming face, and apparent-&#xD;
I y without perceiving him; Dorion followed&#xD;
in her steps, and paused rather confusedly&#xD;
before our hero. Charley regarded him&#xD;
with a strange mixture of feelings, in which&#xD;
anger, however, bore no part.&#xD;
"Boa s~oir / Monsieur Wales," said the&#xD;
officer with an embarrassed bow, curiously&#xD;
unlike his usual easy manner.&#xD;
"Bin soir / Monsieur Dorion," returm~ed&#xD;
Charley, with a smile that added to the&#xD;
warrior's discomfiture; "you were going,&#xD;
n'est ce pas?"&#xD;
"Mais oni; I had - that is, it is my last&#xD;
night in the city, and I must look in at the&#xD;
club."&#xD;
"Will you share my coupe'? I was just&#xD;
about to take my leave, and shall be hon-&#xD;
ored."&#xD;
&#xD;
'Kllferci; but you are just arrived!" re-&#xD;
turned Dorion, ~laneng timidly to~rards&#xD;
Nina, to whom the conversation was quite&#xD;
audible. She was leaning over the players,&#xD;
and the fire of her face was giving place&#xD;
slowly to a deathly pallor.&#xD;
"True," said Charley, with a clear, cold&#xD;
laugh; "it is like F~ydeau's two cooks,&#xD;
celui qui arrive - celui qui pars. No offence,&#xD;
my dear Dorion; we will say I had an en-&#xD;
gagement."&#xD;
Nina did not turn as they passed out, nor&#xD;
did they address her; but as the door closed&#xD;
on the two, and while every occupant of the&#xD;
room stood open-mouthed in wonder at the&#xD;
scene, she gave a low shuddering sob, and&#xD;
sank senseless on the floor.&#xD;
In that instant when Dorion's hot lips&#xD;
were on her fhce, she had caught sight of&#xD;
the tall figure in the mirror, and even at&#xD;
that distance felt the glitter of the b-own&#xD;
eyes. No mortal* voice could have 4ivm&#xD;
adequate expression to the cry which sprang&#xD;
to, but stopped unspoken, at her lips, "Je&#xD;
suis perdue!"&#xD;
'fhe~e was wild confusion in the room.&#xD;
Madame Grandoic followed the example of&#xD;
her charge with commendable promptness,&#xD;
and the demoralization of the three vicux&#xD;
militaires was pitiful. The others, under&#xD;
Henriette's guidance, bore the unconscious&#xD;
Barroune to her chamber, where she was&#xD;
left to the care of the faithful maid, while&#xD;
the guests hurried away with eager feet to&#xD;
spread the marvellous tale. It was not too&#xD;
late for these industrious worthies, and in&#xD;
twenty Parisian salons it was known that&#xD;
night that the Baronne Choisy had had a&#xD;
"violent altercation" with" the American,"&#xD;
and been left insensible on the floor of her&#xD;
parlor by that barbarian. It was fu ther&#xD;
learned, indeed, that same night, that he had&#xD;
knocked her down; and for days that fol-&#xD;
lowed no epithet was too severe for the&#xD;
man concerning whom Paris had quite ex-&#xD;
hausted its indolent curiosity, and from&#xD;
whom it was swift to withdraw its fickle&#xD;
favor.&#xD;
" Vale, 'Vales '- veillez veilleurs!" cried&#xD;
an alliterative wit at the club; and twoscore&#xD;
gentlemen, who might have been classed&#xD;
as the "watchers," drew a quick breath at&#xD;
the news, pricked up their fourscore ears like&#xD;
hounds on the scent, and cried, "Eu/In!"&#xD;
Charley and his companion, arriving at&#xD;
their destination, found the brilliant club-&#xD;
rooms thronged with a numerous company&#xD;
escaped from the stormy streets, and the&#xD;
play at high tide. They sat down mechani-&#xD;
cally at e'carte', neither being in a very col-&#xD;
lected state of mind, and glad of the*&#xD;
diversion; and a circle soon formed about&#xD;
them, attr&amp;amp;~ted by the c(lual skill of the&#xD;
players, as well as by a piquant interest&#xD;
which their known relations, aupr~s the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
FREEDOM--&#xD;
&#xD;
Baronne, lent to the game. No thing that&#xD;
is novel is ever lost in Lut~ce; and as it&#xD;
becamiie known through the salons that the&#xD;
compe'titeurs of the Hotel Clioisy were pitted&#xD;
in play, the encircling group rapidly as-&#xD;
sumed the appearance of a galerie, at least&#xD;
in point of numbers and enthusiasm. The&#xD;
side-betting was excited and extravagant,&#xD;
and the players seemed to catch the reck-&#xD;
less spirit as, while the fortunes of the table&#xD;
varie(l imiipartially, the stakes reached a fig-&#xD;
ure that was far beyond the "rules."&#xD;
Clinrlcy was drinking freely; in which iii-&#xD;
dulgence his opponent, qualified by an&#xD;
African expei-ience, vied with a good grace,&#xD;
but to an indiscreet excess. The soldier's&#xD;
skill, or good luck, deserted him finally,&#xD;
and the luck remained with Charley, until&#xD;
Dorio~ quite lost his head, and, at the con-&#xD;
clusomi of a game which cost him ten thou-&#xD;
sand francs, swore a big soldier oath, and&#xD;
cried a double.&#xD;
"If you will," laughed Charley; "we&#xD;
will prove the maxim of love and cards to&#xD;
be true or false to-night; eh, Dorion 2"&#xD;
" Comment?"&#xD;
"Nothing, double it is; your cards, 1&#xD;
believe."&#xD;
The outsiders had repudiated the even&#xD;
stake ii la Vichy, and five to one was given&#xD;
on Charley. Dorion lost again and again,&#xD;
and was sufficiently sobered to decline fur-&#xD;
ther play, as he well might be. his losses&#xD;
would cripple him for a year to come. I&#xD;
Charley drew him aside, and tore the 1&#xD;
IOU's into bits before his eyes.&#xD;
"Pardon me, Dorion, I cannot take your&#xD;
money, lie said to the amazed and of-&#xD;
feuded officer; "I am indebted to you for&#xD;
enabling me to forget inyseW for two hours.&#xD;
You g to Algiers in the morning?"&#xD;
"Yes; hut, Monsieur Wales -"&#xD;
"We shall not meet again, probably,"&#xD;
continued Charley, ignoring the other's&#xD;
assumption of dignity; "my best wishes,&#xD;
Lieutenant; l)on soir et boa voyage!" Be-&#xD;
foro the bewildered officer could collect his&#xD;
ideas, the young man was gone.&#xD;
"Diable (les A mericains!" he muttered, s&#xD;
as he turned again to the tables; "it 's a&#xD;
case for Charenton; mais il a du c~w', l'en- r&#xD;
faid ! "                                a&#xD;
It was past midnight when~ Charley came a&#xD;
out into the street and the sturm; but the b&#xD;
mood of the elements soothed his heated r&#xD;
brain, and, ignoring the few shivering cab- o&#xD;
bies who k-pt watch at the corner, he e&#xD;
walked away towards the Malesherbes, led t&#xD;
more by instinct than reason. He had for- fi&#xD;
gotten his paletot, and met the beating gale f~&#xD;
in thin evening dress; but of this he had no tI&#xD;
consciousness. A single thought surging a&#xD;
back upon him after the momentary dis- h&#xD;
traction of play occupied his mind swept h&#xD;
from it all others.&#xD;

and by no act of his; to bun emancipated,&#xD;
what were stormy skies Or whistling winds?&#xD;
The heavy bond of yesterday was broken,&#xD;
He had never fully realized the weary&#xD;
weight of that bond till now when it was&#xD;
broken; and the feeling of relief was almost&#xD;
intoxicating. lie reached his quarters, and&#xD;
hurried to his room; a fi~verish, sudden&#xD;
impulse had seized him by that time, -&#xD;
the impulse to fly, to put land and sea&#xD;
between him and this hated Paris, with&#xD;
its glitter and deceit; and he acted upon it&#xD;
with an eagerness that was almost cowardly.&#xD;
He tossed a few things into a portmanteau,&#xD;
anti changed his soaked (Iress for a trav-&#xD;
elling-suit. He felt chilled and uncomfort-&#xD;
able all the time, and drank frequently,&#xD;
and found it a difficult thing to do when he&#xD;
sat down to pen a brief note to ~Somers&#xD;
(who was not "at home" this night), ask-&#xD;
ing him to look after his things for the&#xD;
present.&#xD;
It was not yet daylight when lie rang up&#xD;
the sleepy porter and- dispatched him for&#xD;
a cab. The execution of this order was&#xD;
not conspicuously prompt, but a vehicle was&#xD;
brought at last, and a shining louis lent&#xD;
such sudden speed to Jean's lazy limhs,&#xD;
that the portmanteau was tossed up to its&#xD;
perch as soon as Charley himself had en-&#xD;
~ered the cab and banged the door after&#xD;
him. With the imperturbable dignity of&#xD;
his class, cocker sat silent aloft while these&#xD;
reliminaries were accomplished, blinking&#xD;
with drowsy eyes at his horses. It was&#xD;
)nly when Charley was beginning to won-&#xD;
icr that they did not move off that the&#xD;
~cnius of the box leaned tiown to the win-&#xD;
low, and said quietly, "Eh b'en! mon-&#xD;

Where, indeed! Chancy had not thought&#xD;
)f that. "Was there a train out of the city&#xD;
n any direction at that hour?"&#xD;
"There is one at six for the North,&#xD;
n'sieur; it is the express for Calais."&#xD;
As the cab rolled away upon the Boule-&#xD;
ard, the now thoroughly awakened porter&#xD;
thought himself of a sin of omission, and&#xD;
ushed wildly in pursuit, with a tiny note&#xD;
a his hand which had come at midnight for&#xD;

to Calais; he felt badly, but attributed his&#xD;
illness to loss of sleep, and fought; off the&#xD;
chill with his flask; and there was some-&#xD;
thing so inspiriting in the thought of getting&#xD;
back to grave, homelike old London, which&#xD;
loomed up in his fancy now as a great,&#xD;
secure refuge ahead, that it nerved him to&#xD;
resist the growing weakness. It was a&#xD;
bitter, drizzling day on the Channel, with&#xD;
a legion of storm-devils howling down from&#xD;
the North Sea; but he had turned hot by&#xD;
that time, and walked the deck careless of&#xD;
rain and cold. Only when he sat in the&#xD;
train en route to London did he begin to&#xD;
suspect he was really ill, and find his&#xD;
strength deserting him. He was barely&#xD;
able to drag himself to a cab at Ludo'ate&#xD;
Hill and order the driver to his 1Lote'~ in&#xD;
Saint Martin's le Grand.&#xD;
"The seasickest Frenchman you never&#xD;
saw!" cabbie informed divers of his con-&#xD;
frhres over the traditional "bucket of water&#xD;
and 'two' of gin," "what wanted to allay&#xD;
veet to the - 'Otel for bun pubwar!"&#xD;
Limited as was that worthy's acquaintance&#xD;
with the French tongue, it quite covered&#xD;
the significance of the last word, and he&#xD;
had whirled Charley around to Aldersgate&#xD;
as only a Jehu of the London streets may&#xD;
do.&#xD;
At the hotel Charley went to bed, and&#xD;
after some hours of increasing distress sent&#xD;
for a physician. It was not too soon; at&#xD;
midnight he was in a raging fever, which&#xD;
was only diverted from his head to take the&#xD;
equally serious form of acute inflammation of&#xD;
the lungs, -his old weak spot. He hung&#xD;
between life and death for days; but his&#xD;
attendant was a man of skill, who kept him&#xD;
in the sleepless care of an accomplished&#xD;
nurse, and he rallied at last, feebly indeed,&#xD;
but surely. His convalescence was slow,&#xD;
an(l the spring had worn away to its latest&#xD;
month before he was strong enough to get&#xD;
upon his feet. It was a memorable time;&#xD;
and among the last to fade from his&#xD;
recollection will be those long, thoughtful,&#xD;
regenerating days, when he lay so weak and&#xD;
helpless in the very heart of London, a&#xD;
shipwrecked waif upon that vast ocean of&#xD;
life. With all its myriad voices he grew&#xD;
familiar; in the long night-watches be&#xD;
learned the very tones of the time-bells;&#xD;
the solemn echo of St. Paul's, the historic&#xD;
ring of St. Saviour's, which for centuries had&#xD;
sling the death.song for the condemned of&#xD;
Old Bailey; the silver clamor of Bow Bells,&#xD;
and the clear but distant notes of St. Mary's&#xD;
le Strand~ These alone spoke in the brief&#xD;
pause of darkness; but with the hint of day&#xD;
the murmur of life began again, swelling&#xD;
with the dull light of early morning into a&#xD;
million-tongued roar, eloquent yet unintel-&#xD;
lio'ible. The laden omnibuses tearing down&#xD;
t~'the Bank, witl~ some merry trumpeter on&#xD;
&#xD;
the box, waking the echoes of the "highest&#xD;
ground" with a silver note; the sharper&#xD;
rattle of motley vehicles; the cry of fleet&#xD;
newsboys and lagging hucksters; the rag-&#xD;
man's bells; the tramp of parading volun-&#xD;
teers, or clatter0of little feet as charity-school&#xD;
children trudged by ; - all floated in at his&#xD;
window, conveying in one tremendous voice&#xD;
all the immeasurable life that dwells under&#xD;
the name of London. Well might one&#xD;
grow sober and humble at thought of all&#xD;
thbse millions of sorrow-burdened hearts,&#xD;
and turn to ponder anew upon the sorrows&#xD;
and the resources of his own.&#xD;
In these passive days he grew strong,&#xD;
morally as well as physically, and he rose&#xD;
from his bed a changed man.&#xD;
The day when he might be moved came&#xD;
round at last.&#xD;
"We must have you out of this," said&#xD;
Duncan, "and down among the green fields,&#xD;
or, what is better, by the sea. I have taken&#xD;
the liberty to arrange it all for you, though&#xD;
my part is in simply turning you over to a&#xD;
professional friend at Ventuor. He has&#xD;
found a place where you will have quiet,&#xD;
home care, and, if medical assistance should&#xD;
be needed, I can recommend him fully as&#xD;
my successor. But all you require now is&#xD;
air and discretion, and you will be yourself&#xD;
again in a short time. You have had a&#xD;
narrow escape, and I suspect there was not&#xD;
much excuse for your danger. Ah! you&#xD;
young men! If 1 had the ruling of it, none&#xD;
of you should go to Paris till you were as&#xD;
gray, at least, as I am!"&#xD;
So Charley went down to the Isle of&#xD;
Wight, and was lodged in a pretty cottage&#xD;
in the Undereliff. The May roses were&#xD;
already blooming about the door, while&#xD;
over the sand the familiar Atlantic stretched&#xD;
away before him in sunny glory. Here the&#xD;
days sped swiftly; but each brought a gain&#xD;
of health and strength.&#xD;
Down at that other cottage by the Med-&#xD;
iterranean, the early April days brought the&#xD;
date fixed for beginning the long-canvassed&#xD;
Italian tour. Richard Huntley still lingered&#xD;
with the party, but said he should only&#xD;
remain to see them safely over the border,&#xD;
and then take his way to the North. To the&#xD;
urgency of Clare and the frankly expressed&#xD;
wish of her mother that he would accompany&#xD;
them, he returned the same half-sad, half-&#xD;
smiling reply, and waited ever for the other&#xD;
voice. But Emma kept silence; the poor&#xD;
heart no longer knew itself. The farewell&#xD;
rambles came at lust; long, dreamy, and&#xD;
regretful, among the fragrant orange-trees,&#xD;
and along the terraces carpeted with scarlet&#xD;
anemones; and in one of them he said to&#xD;
her, "Once I asked you, Miss Emma, if I&#xD;
might go with you on a long voyage; may&#xD;
I ask again now?"&#xD;
&#xD;
107&#xD;
&#xD;
And she answered simply, as in a daze, "I am going with you to Italy!" he&#xD;
"If you will, Mr. Huntley," giving him her cried, gayly.&#xD;
hand as she spoke.                      "It 's not a compliment to my powers of&#xD;
She too had come to regard the gift as persuasion, monsieur," said the lady with a&#xD;
inevitable, and she thought of it, if without laugh, though there were tears in the eyes&#xD;

to her, that sometimes she felt borne down maliciously, as if she were studying a pen-&#xD;
by a weight of obligation, and she was ance for him, but~he only beamed more&#xD;
happier now in the thought of making gayly.&#xD;
payment. She was not sure she loved him, "We will work you well, at any rate; and&#xD;
certainly she did not as she bad loved the you may begin, Sir Richard, at once, by en-&#xD;

herself if this serious, grateful regard which "A triumphal car, madame; we will enter&#xD;

in words that soothed the little tumult of "Trust me, dear Mrs. Jennings, I'll be&#xD;
her heart,                            awfully good," he said, laughing; but adding&#xD;
"As the years go, Emma, I am almost an with infinite tenderness, as he turned to go,&#xD;

hand softly, so softly that from time to time lin&#xD;

that th6y might avail themselves of the&#xD;
smooth Atlantic of early summer. Hunt-&#xD;
ley found unusual difficulty in securing their&#xD;
passage across. The Cunard steamers were&#xD;
taken up with full lists for weeks ahead,&#xD;
and he was eventually compelled to take&#xD;
staterooms on a steamer of another line.&#xD;
They made efforts at Paris to communicate&#xD;
with Charley, but could learn nothing what-&#xD;
ever of his whereabouts. Huntley informed&#xD;
himself fully through Somers of the young&#xD;
man's mysterious disappearance, but was&#xD;
discreetly silent even to Mrs. Jennings;&#xD;
the utter absence of any clew puzzled him,&#xD;
and gave him considerable uneasiness. The&#xD;
Baronne, he learned, had left the city, imme-&#xD;
diately after Charley's departure, for her&#xD;
chateau, to "assist," as the Parisian world&#xD;
said, at the demise of Baron Choisy, who&#xD;
was gathered to his ancestors soon after.&#xD;
Beyond this nothing was known; at the&#xD;
banker's no word whatever had been re-&#xD;
ceived from Mr. ~Vales, nor had any wan-&#xD;
dering soul succeeded in this instance in&#xD;
tracing him to a hiding-place. The gossips&#xD;
themselves, having exhausted their wits on&#xD;
the subject, finally compromised upon the&#xD;
hypothesis that a reconciliation had been&#xD;
effected between the young man and Nina,&#xD;
and that he was only awaiting in seclusion&#xD;
the passage of a saving interval, after which&#xD;
the monde expected nothing less than a mar-&#xD;
riage of veuve Chosy and "the Amcrican."&#xD;
Huntley was pleased finally to accept this&#xD;
view of the case as favorable to his ends;&#xD;
though Somers declared it was "all wrong,"&#xD;
and so much of the story as related to the&#xD;
expected alliance he communicated to Mrs.&#xD;
Jennings, who in turn conveyed it carefully&#xD;
to Emma. If the latter was especially dis-&#xD;
appointed, she gave no visible evidence of it&#xD;
beyond saying very quietly, "I should have&#xD;
liked to see my cousin very much."&#xD;
Did she then misjudge herself? Per-&#xD;
haps; at any rate, Richard Huntley, who&#xD;
heard the words with a chill, said in his&#xD;
soul, "I am desperately glad you did not!"&#xD;
Matters followed their rapid course; and at&#xD;
noon precisely, on the 22d of June, they&#xD;
steame(l out of Liverpool harbor for home,&#xD;
and Huntley's heart was glad.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
EEVELATiON.&#xD;
I HAVE said that the time sped pleas-'&#xD;
antly for Charley at his new home in&#xD;
"stately Wight"; but the words fail to&#xD;
express the quiet enjoyment of those days,&#xD;
in which the sweet sense of returning&#xD;
health gave a glad and grateful tone to sur-&#xD;

REVELATION-.&#xD;
&#xD;
hero. He was the guest of a widow lady,&#xD;
whose slender income received additions by&#xD;
the occasional contributions of one or more&#xD;
invalid lodgers like himself, coming to her,&#xD;
as he had done, at the advice of the princi-&#xD;
pal physician of the place. The household&#xD;
consisted of the mistress, her aged father,&#xD;
and two children, boys of twelve and four-&#xD;
teen. There was, besides, an invalid lady&#xD;
of a certain age, who seldom left her cham-&#xD;
ber, and held coldly aloof from "the Ameri-&#xD;
can" until that charitable young man quite&#xD;
won her over by deferential attentions and&#xD;
the grateful acceptance of a budget of&#xD;
Church publications. Chancy was espe-&#xD;
cially interested in his hostess, whose win-&#xD;
ning and motherly manner was marked by&#xD;
a settled melancholy that appealed power-&#xD;
fully to his sympathy. Her age was a puz-&#xD;
zle; but he was quite sure that the worn&#xD;
face, which had once been very lovely, and&#xD;
the silvered hair, were aged rather by suf-&#xD;
fering than by years. Had he required her&#xD;
care, he felt how gentle and tender a nurse&#xD;
she would have been; but that need was&#xD;
past. It was wonderful how he rallied in&#xD;
the bracing sea air, and felt the lost strength&#xD;
coming back with every breath; and it was&#xD;
only when he faced himself in the mirror,&#xD;
and looked curiously at the thin, white fea-&#xD;
tures, thrown into vivid relief by a thick,&#xD;
dark beard, that he realized the "facts"&#xD;
again; though even at these he only smiled&#xD;
now in the fullness of his spirits.&#xD;
He made himself a great favorite at the&#xD;
cottage in a little time, winning all hearts&#xD;
with his pleasant words, and demolishing&#xD;
the prejudices of the elders against his&#xD;
"Yankee" blood, with never-varying good-&#xD;
humor. With the old gentleman, who was&#xD;
a quaint relic of the smaller commercial&#xD;
class of London, he would sit up to any&#xD;
hour, over mild gin-and-water, and listen&#xD;
without weariness to ,endless reminiscences&#xD;
of Kent Road and the" City" of fifty years&#xD;
back; while with the boys, fine, manly fel-&#xD;
lows, whose dark, un-English faces always&#xD;
stirred some undefinable memory in his&#xD;
heart, he shook off ten heavy years, joining&#xD;
them in their boating, paddling for shrimps,&#xD;
and " larking" in a hundred ways, for days&#xD;
together. Not but that he had mnny sober&#xD;
hours, even sad ones, in which the life to&#xD;
come was studied bravely and hopefully,&#xD;
though not without some pain; but in this&#xD;
holiday-time and day of deliverance, as it&#xD;
sometimes seemed to be, there was much&#xD;
that was joyous, and of this he made the&#xD;
most.&#xD;
"You are getting strong so fast we shall&#xD;
lose you some fine day soon, I fear," said&#xD;
the widow, a little sadly, when June with&#xD;
its daily pilgrimage of city wanderers, in-&#xD;
tent on Canisbrook and Osborne House, had&#xD;
come.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Indeed, Mrs. Delafield, I had scarcely&#xD;
thought of it, it is so delightful here, an&#xD;
~ ou have made it seem like home to m&#xD;
es, I must go soon~"&#xD;
"Shall you return to New York, Mi&#xD;
Wales?" she asked, thoughtfully.&#xD;
"Yes, I think so; not to remain there&#xD;
perhaps, but for a time, certainly."&#xD;
After a moment of silence the lady con&#xD;
tinned, flushing slightly as she spoke&#xD;
" Some day before you go, Mr. Wales, wil&#xD;
you allow me to inflict somncthing of my his&#xD;
tory upon you? If you knew it, you migh~&#xD;
do me a service in America."&#xD;
"1 should be glad indeed of the oppor&#xD;
unity to dp that, to do anything in my&#xD;
power for you, Mrs. Delafield. I shall al~&#xD;
ways owe you a debt, and Welcome any&#xD;
chance of paying you in part. I must think&#xD;
more of going now, too. I have been re-&#xD;
luctant to do it heretofore."&#xD;
Yes, he would go back to New York.&#xD;
There had been a nervous shrinking when&#xD;
he first approached that determination; no&#xD;
moment probably was more trying to the&#xD;
prodigal than that in which he mastered the&#xD;
stubborn heart and resolved to go back in hu-&#xD;
mility to his father's house, to face the gibes&#xD;
and sneers, and win back the difficult favor&#xD;
of the world; but he met it bravely, and&#xD;
grew strong in the resolve. If it were per-&#xD;
mitted him,, he would try to win forgiveness&#xD;
of his father. He would ask no further fa-&#xD;
vors, as he had still something of his own;&#xD;
and in some of the countless avenues,&#xD;
in some one of those marvellous growing&#xD;
Western cities perhaps, he could begin&#xD;
the new life, surround himself with new as-&#xD;
sociations, and grow to fill some useful&#xD;
place. They were brave pictures, and he&#xD;
found a deep gratification in drawing them,&#xD;
and sometimes a strong impulse to hasten&#xD;
away to their accomplishment; but this he&#xD;
checked. He would do nothing more hastily&#xD;
or blindly as long as he lived. He thought&#xD;
often of his cousin, too, with a sad humility&#xD;
that was void of bitterness. The scene on&#xD;
the Corniche was very vivid in his memory,&#xD;
and he imagined her now only as the wife&#xD;
of Richard Huntley, and bowed to the fate.&#xD;
"He will make her happy because he will&#xD;
appreciate her. how thingseome about!"&#xD;
he said to the sands. "I could not have&#xD;
borne the thought once. Heigho! here are&#xD;
the boys. Well, what is it? a row? I 'm&#xD;
with you; I have gqt quite strong with the&#xD;
oars again."&#xD;
"So you have, Mr. Charles, -- so you&#xD;
have!"&#xD;
tie lingered in the island for more than&#xD;
a fortnight after that brief conversation with&#xD;
the. widow; but he had set a day, mean-&#xD;
while, for his departure, and like all set&#xD;
days it came around very soon. it was only&#xD;
on the preceding afternoon that, lAying&#xD;
&#xD;
109&#xD;
&#xD;
y delicately reminded his hostess of her pro-&#xD;
ri posed commission, and repeated the assur-&#xD;
ance of the pleasure it would give him to&#xD;
serve her in any way, lie received from her&#xD;
lips the promised narrative. It was in the&#xD;
privacy of the little parlor, the scene of&#xD;
, many pleasant memories to Charley, who&#xD;
little dreamed of the great event which was&#xD;
- at hand to make it more than memorable.&#xD;
"You will not find my story a vci'y&#xD;
1 happy one, Mr. Wales," she began, with a&#xD;
- sad smile, and evidently with some effort.&#xD;
There was a pitiful, appealing expressiomi&#xD;
in her face that won all his sympathy at&#xD;
the start, and instinctively he took the thin&#xD;
hand and held it while she spoke. "hf I&#xD;
- did not know your good heart, I should not&#xD;
burden you with my sorrows; but it has&#xD;
been my hope tbr years to meet with an&#xD;
American in whom I could confide, and&#xD;
you have seemed almost like an answering&#xD;
messenger to my prayer. You will think&#xD;
me weak and foolish, it may be, when you&#xD;
know 'dl, and the one hope in life I retain;&#xD;
but there are ties in life, Mr. Wales, from&#xD;
which no woman's heart can free itself.&#xD;
I am not a widow; I am only a deserted&#xD;
wife. I feel sure that my husband still&#xD;
lives, though I have heard no word fm'oiu&#xD;
him for twelve years. May God forgive&#xD;
me if I do him wrong! he may have died&#xD;
even in those days so long ago; but I cam~-&#xD;
not stifle the voice of my heart, which&#xD;
always tells me he is alive, and that I shall&#xD;
see him again." She paused a moment, and&#xD;
turned away to brush two stubborn tears&#xD;
from her eyes, while Charley silently pon-&#xD;
dered on this explanation of the stricken&#xD;
face. "It sounds strange to you," she con-&#xD;
tinued, "and scarcely less so to me, listening&#xD;
to my own words; in all these years it has&#xD;
seemed a bitter dream. I can never real-&#xD;
ize it, and am always thinking I shall&#xD;
wake again, and find him with inc. It has&#xD;
been hard, Mr. Wales. One day I was a&#xD;
young, happy wife -0, so happy! - and&#xD;
the next as you see me now, alone ii~~the&#xD;
world."&#xD;
"But have you never had a~my tidings, no&#xD;
clew---?"&#xD;
"Neve~but once, and then a mere straw.&#xD;
I had best tell you all the story. Fifteen&#xD;
years ago we lived on Clapliam Rise,&#xD;
you know it, - over on the Surrey si(lc. My&#xD;
mother was living then; but I was the only&#xD;
child left at home, all my brothers having&#xD;
married and scattered. We had a large&#xD;
house, and mother was one of those old-&#xD;
fashioned, busy women who live in a con-&#xD;
stant state of occupation; she had always&#xD;
had a great family to look after, and it&#xD;
made her miserable to be so~sohitary and&#xD;
have so little to do, especially as flither was&#xD;
absent a great deal of the time at Ports-&#xD;
mouth], assisting my eldest brother in busi-&#xD;

&#xD;
ness; so, though we did not need to do it,&#xD;
we took in gentlemen lodgers. Among&#xD;
them were two young men who engaged&#xD;
our best suite of rooms at a liberal price,&#xD;
making them partially their lodgings. They&#xD;
wer~ of about the same age, and both very&#xD;
handsome men; evidently wealthy and aris-&#xD;
tocratic, and very great friends. They&#xD;
led gay lives; sometimes large parties of&#xD;
fine gentlemen would call for them, and in&#xD;
the season a great many notes and invita-&#xD;
tions arrived fbr them by every post. We&#xD;
believed then that they were younger sons&#xD;
of noble families, who took the rooms for&#xD;
convenience, as many of that class do.&#xD;
Well, to come to my part, the gentlemen&#xD;
were always very gracious and polite to mc,&#xD;
and the elder - we always thought him&#xD;
the elder by a few years - grew atten-&#xD;
tive at last. I was a rather attractive girl,&#xD;
I suppose; and being the only daughter in&#xD;
a large family of brothers, I had been made&#xD;
much of. My poor father gave me every&#xD;
opportunity to become accomplished, and&#xD;
I had improved my advantages fairly;&#xD;
mother was very proud, I renieu~ber, of my&#xD;
music and drawing, and I must have been a&#xD;
little conscious; a little vain, perhaps, as&#xD;
the boys all called me 'The Duchess.'&#xD;
Mother was watchful, and did not like Mr.&#xD;
Delafield's attention to me; but I was head-'&#xD;
strong and followed the usual course of&#xD;
girls, giving him ample return, until we&#xD;
had a final acknowledgment of mutual'&#xD;
affection. Our courtship ended happily,&#xD;
however; he told father who lie was, very&#xD;
frankly, an(l asked my hand in marriage,&#xD;
only stipulating that the ceremony should&#xD;
be kept secret for a time from his family.&#xD;
lie belonged to the nobility, and had been&#xD;
an officer in India and a great deal abroad,&#xD;
on government service; but at that time and&#xD;
for some reason I never learned, he was on&#xD;
bad terms with his brother, who was the&#xD;
head of the family. We were married pri-&#xD;
vately, only two or three of his friends&#xD;
being present, and then ~vent down to a&#xD;
cottage he had rented at Richmond, where&#xD;
we lived very happily for more than a year,&#xD;
and where William was born. My husband&#xD;
was away from me a great deal in London,&#xD;
but continued always very loving and de-&#xD;
voted when at home, and I was perfectly&#xD;
content and happy. He never told me&#xD;
much of his life; he seemed always to be&#xD;
waiting for a reconciliation with his brother,&#xD;
and often said that we should go into the&#xD;
world some day, and meet his people; but&#xD;
I cared very little for that, and told him&#xD;
so; he was the world to me. And I think&#xD;
- I know, he loved me then. He was so&#xD;
good to me, and he could be very passionate&#xD;
and terrible to others, as I had opportunities&#xD;
of knowing. No, that doubt has never&#xD;
added to my sorrow; for even now, after&#xD;
&#xD;
years of thinking, I know my husband loved&#xD;
me.&#xD;
She paused a moment, and Charley felt&#xD;
the clasp of her fingers tightening, but un-&#xD;
conscious, on his own.&#xD;
"His friend visited us often at the cot-&#xD;
tage; except my parents, he was the only&#xD;
one who came, and I sometimes fancied&#xD;
that he and Robert were engaged together&#xD;
in some sort of business, though perhaps it&#xD;
was only horse-racing. I never asked my&#xD;
husband about such things. The gentleman&#xD;
was a very pleasant, merry man, and we&#xD;
used to have delightful evenings together&#xD;
when he was there.&#xD;
"Well, about eighteen months after our&#xD;
marriage, this man caine one day in great&#xD;
haste to the villa, and asked for Robert,&#xD;
who was not at home. He then hurried&#xD;
away, after telling me not to be alarmed&#xD;
if I did not see my husband that night, or&#xD;
even for several days. Then I got a note&#xD;
from Robert in the evening, saying that&#xD;
business would take him away, perhaps for&#xD;
a week. It was more than a week before&#xD;
I heard again, and then a letter came from&#xD;
him at Paris, saying he would soon return;&#xD;
but I was to leave the house at Richmond,&#xD;
and meet him at my father's. I began to&#xD;
he frightened by all this mystery, but did&#xD;
as he bade me, though it wrung my heart&#xD;
to leave the cottage; I had slept under its&#xD;
roof every might mince our marriage. He&#xD;
came back a few days afterwards, as he had&#xD;
said, and joined me at Clapham. He looked&#xD;
pale and worn, and seemed to have tried to&#xD;
disguise himself by shaving' 'his face clean.&#xD;
I was sure there was some trouble, and&#xD;
asked hint what it was. He said it was&#xD;
all along of 'poor Ned' and the 'Jews,'&#xD;
but he could n't tell me any more then,&#xD;
and I must n't worry, as it would all come&#xD;
right. He did not go out at all for two&#xD;
days; but one or two men came in the&#xD;
evenings, and he had long, private inter-&#xD;
views with them in the library. The second&#xD;
night he came up very late to our room.&#xD;
I was in bed, but lay awake awaiting him;&#xD;
but he said he must write some letters&#xD;
and I must go to sleep; I did so, while he&#xD;
was writing at tIme table. In the night I&#xD;
woke up with a start; he was standing over&#xD;
me, looking at me very strangely. X~ hen&#xD;
he saw I was awake, he bent down amid&#xD;
kissed me, and said, ' Go to sleep again,&#xD;
puss; I am not through yet'; and went back&#xD;
to the table. I did fall asleep again, Mr.&#xD;
Wales, I was such an unsuspecting, happy&#xD;
child! In the morning he was not there;&#xD;
he had gone out in the night, and I have&#xD;
never seen him since."&#xD;
It was a strange story, and Charlr'y sat&#xD;
silent and thoughtful at its close; while Mrs.&#xD;
Delafield dried her tears and choked down&#xD;
a soh or two which came at the last.&#xD;

&#xD;
arranged to go in the morning, and his&#xD;
trunks were packed. In spite of his trem-&#xD;
bling hand he managed to make a hurried&#xD;
croquis of that flice; he could have hit it&#xD;
almost as well from memory. Mrs. Dela-&#xD;
field marvelled at the likeness, but said&#xD;
quickly, "You have left out the whis-&#xD;
kers!"&#xD;
"Yes, they were not necessary, and I&#xD;
hurried over it. Your revelation has spurred&#xD;
my conscience, Mrs. Delafield, given me&#xD;
another incentive to hasten home; so I&#xD;
have determined to lose no more time, but&#xD;
go up to London to-night."&#xD;
"AhI but to-morrow will do as well; we&#xD;
shall be sorry to miss this last evening."&#xD;
"And so shall 1; but I have already&#xD;
delayed too long. 1 mean to catch Satur-&#xD;
day's steamei at Liverpool, and I must go&#xD;
over to Paris first; so you see there is a&#xD;
great deal of travelling to be done in a&#xD;
short time. I shall save a day by going up&#xD;
to-nioht."&#xD;
"~ou know best, of course; but you must&#xD;
not overdo yourself. You know you are&#xD;
not quite so strong yet as you were.&#xD;
Bidding her good by, Charley said to&#xD;
her in a low voice, "I shall find your&#xD;
husband; I know it, and promise it."&#xD;
She embraced him with uncontrollable&#xD;
joy, but could not speak. She ~v~nidered&#xD;
why he had shuddered when sbe ki' sod him.&#xD;
The old gentleman and the boys went&#xD;
with him to the station, which was close at&#xD;
hand. On the walk thither, while the boys&#xD;
were running ahead, the elder said, inter-&#xD;
rogatively, "My daughter has told you the&#xD;
sad story of her life, I think?"&#xD;
"Yes; I was deeply pained by it," an-&#xD;
swered Charley.&#xD;
After a moment Mr. Raygood continued:&#xD;
"I need hardly tell you that she was quite&#xD;
blind to the real character of her husband,&#xD;
and has always remained so. We thought&#xD;
it best that she should. He was a criminal,&#xD;
sir; influence and name alone saved him&#xD;
from penal service."&#xD;
Charley heard the womds with a dull pain.&#xD;
How he had been duped in this man! But&#xD;
what he had done seemed insignificant com-&#xD;
pared with what he might still do. "It&#xD;
was criminal to leave his wife as he did,"&#xD;
h0 said, mechanically.&#xD;
"I cannot think any benefit would come&#xD;
to her through his return, even if that were&#xD;
possible," added the old man.&#xD;
fly this time they had reached the sta-&#xD;
tion; the boys had come up, and Charley&#xD;
made no reply. Five minutes later he was&#xD;
steaming away to Ryde.&#xD;
At Portsmouth he learned that he could&#xD;
take a steamer from Southampton to Havre&#xD;
that night; but a quick calculation showed&#xD;
the London route to be the shortest in time;&#xD;
so on to the city he went. He was at Water-&#xD;
&#xD;
be at six o'clock, and had time to snatch a&#xD;
meal at Ludgate Hill before the night ex-&#xD;
press for Dover. He had for a moment de-&#xD;
bated the question of stopping a day in&#xD;
London to see if anything could be learned&#xD;
there, but all his instincts moved him&#xD;
towards Paris. It seemed, also, as if Hunt-&#xD;
Icy would avoid London. At any rate, he&#xD;
determined to push on. Steam-speed seemed&#xD;
a foot-race to his impatience; but there was&#xD;
no delay. He dashed by St. Denis in the&#xD;
glow of sunrise, and was back at the great&#xD;
Station of the North when Paris was at its&#xD;
early coffee.&#xD;
He left his modest luggage at the gare,&#xD;
and feed a sleepy cocker munificently to&#xD;
drive him quickly to the Grand Caf~, which,&#xD;
of course, that immovable functionary in-&#xD;
sisted upon doing at the traditional trot.&#xD;
The bank doors in the Rue Scribe were not&#xD;
yet opened, and he went in to get some&#xD;
breakfast at the cafes where his not very&#xD;
elegant exterior was irreverently comment-&#xD;
ed upon by sundry gar~ons in spotless waist-&#xD;
coats and the whitest of neck-ties. They&#xD;
were far from recognizing l'enfant dc l'Amc'~.&#xD;
rique of six months before, whose appear-&#xD;
ance had been the signal fQr the fleetest&#xD;
of movements and the most graceful Que&#xD;
vcut-il prendre, monsieur?&#xD;
"You don't know me?" asked Charley,&#xD;
quietly, of the elegant gentleman who&#xD;
poured his coffee.&#xD;
"ZIIais non; pour le moment, snonsicur.&#xD;
Pardon! have I ever had the honor -?"&#xD;
" Tant micux!" said Charley, indiffer-&#xD;
ently. "Know you if Monsieur Somers is&#xD;
in Paris?"&#xD;
"At this moment Monsieur Somers is in&#xD;
Paris."&#xD;
"Merci! l'addition."&#xD;
The knight of the napkin brought the&#xD;
note in a daze, and remained in a daze&#xD;
when Charley tossed a louis on the plate,&#xD;
and went out.&#xD;
"Voilh un homme!" said the immaculate,&#xD;
with great dignity to his mates. "On no&#xD;
peut juger jamais le via par l'ctiquette.&#xD;
Parbleu! cinq francs de pourboire plus&#xD;
quatre-vingt centimes!"&#xD;
Charley went at once to the banker's, and&#xD;
walked directly into the inner office with a&#xD;
beating heart. A principal, seated at his&#xD;
desk, looked up in surprise.&#xD;
"I beg pardon," said Chancy with a&#xD;
tremulous voice, "can you tell me if Mrs.&#xD;
Jennings and party are still in Europe?"&#xD;
"Ab! they will tell you outside," was&#xD;
the curt reply. It had at least the good&#xD;
effect of quieting Charley's pulse like a&#xD;
dash of water.&#xD;
"Thank you. I. am Mr. Wales of New&#xD;
York. Do you happen to have any letters&#xD;
for me?"&#xD;
"Mr. Wales! is it possible? A thou-&#xD;
&#xD;
REVEl&#xD;
&#xD;
sand pardons. I did not recognize you.&#xD;
You are wonderfully changed. Letters?&#xD;
I will inquire ~&#xD;
And Mrs. Jennings's address, if you&#xD;
please."&#xD;
"Ab, yes! they were going home soon, I&#xD;
think. Brooks, have Mrs. Jennings and&#xD;
party sailed for home yet?"&#xD;
"Sail in the - on the 22d, sir."&#xD;
"When!" cried Charley.&#xD;
"The 22d; to-morrow, sir," the clerk re-&#xD;
peated.&#xD;
"From Liverpool, of course. They were&#xD;
here a few days since only; the young&#xD;
lady invalid quite recovered, I understood.&#xD;
There was a gentleman with them who in-&#xD;
quired after you, - Mr. Hunt-"&#xD;
"Yes, I know; and Miss flowland was&#xD;
quite well?"&#xD;
"I was told so. There has been a great&#xD;
deal of inquiry for you, Mr. Wales. Ak!&#xD;
here are some letters."&#xD;
"Thank you. Can you tell me whether&#xD;
I could catch this steamer?"&#xD;
"To-morrow's steamer?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"It 's a chance. There is a tidal train&#xD;
by the Boulogne and Folkstone route at one&#xD;
o'clock, I think. By that you might catch a&#xD;
night express on the Northwestern, and be&#xD;
in Liverpool by mornino-."&#xD;
"Thank you. Will y~eu have my account&#xD;
balanced? I will call for it. Good morn-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
Going out Charley glanced at tl~e regis-&#xD;
ter, and felt a second thrill of satisfaction&#xD;
in seeing the name "Miss lowland"&#xD;
therein, even though it was written in the&#xD;
bold hand of [-luntley. But he must catch&#xD;
the steamer; and he grew hot amid cold by&#xD;
turns, thinking of the chances. Once he&#xD;
was tempted to telegraph something to Mrs.&#xD;
Jennings and secure a delay; but it was&#xD;
only a momentary impulse: that resort&#xD;
would remain, thanks to science and cables,&#xD;
even if he missed the ship. He went in at&#xD;
Bowles's, and posted himself fully about&#xD;
the trains, though the result of his inquiries&#xD;
only confirmed the banker's statement;&#xD;
there was nothing earlier than the Boulogne&#xD;
"tidal." This gave him some hours to re-&#xD;
main in the city, but they were unwelcome&#xD;
ones. There was nothing he eared for&#xD;
there, and he rejoiced in the natural dis-&#xD;
guise which concealed his identity so ef-&#xD;
fectually from more than one well-known&#xD;
eye. He read his letters, but they were all&#xD;
of ancient dates, and none, as he faintly&#xD;
hoped, from his father or cousin. Then he&#xD;
went to the Malesherbes, and met with a&#xD;
touching and iuelod~amatic reception from I&#xD;
the concierge. In the old quarters nothing&#xD;
was changed. Somers's room showed sio-ns&#xD;
0~&#xD;
of recent occupation, and his own was in&#xD;
perfect order and readiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
~ATJON.                             113&#xD;
"He orders it so, monsieur; all the weeks&#xD;
he makes me to change the linen on the&#xD;
bed. He is desold because monsieur goes&#xD;
to come never again."&#xD;
Charley dismissed her and hung himself&#xD;
upon a sofa in the little salon-parlor, fwnoir,&#xD;
and consultation-room of those other days.&#xD;
How strano'e and unreal it all seemed!&#xD;
Only the windowss opened there with the&#xD;
same soft air of summer wafting in, as of a&#xD;
year before, with the shadows of the incipi-&#xD;
ent Haussmannic trees falling across the&#xD;
sills, and Madame's cherished family of&#xD;
canaries chirping away below, seemed curi-&#xD;
ously home-like and real. One's earliest&#xD;
memories of particular places are ever the&#xD;
most vivid; and here Charley's Paris life&#xD;
had begun only a year before! It seemed&#xD;
an age, with all the phantasmagoria of&#xD;
scenes and faces dancing in the glass of&#xD;
memory. For the first time since he had&#xD;
entered the gates, he thought of her with a&#xD;
dull sensation of pain, perhaps of pity. A&#xD;
step on the stairs put the thought to flight;&#xD;
it might be Somers. He eared not if it&#xD;
was or was not; that individual had small&#xD;
prominence in his present plans, though he&#xD;
would have chosen, perhaps, not to see him.&#xD;
It was Somers. He came in puffing with&#xD;
the noon heat, and stopped short as his eye&#xD;
fell on the recumbent figure. He had&#xD;
missed the concierge and was unwarned.&#xD;
WTClI ! " he cried with a short lauoh&#xD;
"here 's a go! By Jove! I admire mon:&#xD;
sicur's graceful abandon. May I inquire&#xD;
to whom-? Good God! is it you, Char-&#xD;
Icy?"&#xD;
"Why not?" was the cold response.&#xD;
"Why not, indeed? why not months&#xD;
ago? heavens, how altered you are! you&#xD;
(lon't look well. You are not refusing my&#xD;
han(l, arc you, old boy?"&#xD;
He had come up and extended his own,&#xD;
but Chancy lay quite .notionless, looking at&#xD;
him steadily but rather indolently.&#xD;
"It looks like it, does n't it? I am only&#xD;
wonOering now, Ned Somers, ~whether you&#xD;
too are a villain, or only a victim!"&#xD;
The Englishman flushed scarlet, and&#xD;
Charley, still watching him steadily, saw&#xD;
big drops gather on his forehead.&#xD;
"I don't know what you mean, Charley,"&#xD;
he said, sadly. "I never did you an inten-&#xD;
tional wrong; and if I lent myself to such a&#xD;
purpose, it was in simple ignorance and be-&#xD;
cause I had no choice. I don't think I am&#xD;
~juite a villain, as you put it; but I am a&#xD;
victim fast enough, God knows I&#xD;
Chancy was silent; Somers sat down, but&#xD;
instantly got up again and walked nervous-&#xD;
ly up and down the room.&#xD;
"I don't know what you may have dis-&#xD;
~overed; I can't know, because the whole&#xD;
sifair in which you and Dick Iluntley have&#xD;
figured in some secret connection has been&#xD;

&#xD;
CHOISY.&#xD;
&#xD;
an inexplicable mystery to me from first to&#xD;
last. My only active part in it, if you care&#xD;
to know, was getting you away from Paris&#xD;
last September, and you will hardly accuse&#xD;
me of having forced you much on that occa-&#xD;
sion. I got occasional orders from Huntley;&#xD;
that was one of them; and there were&#xD;
pretty powerful reasons for my attending to&#xD;
them, though, had I known you then as I&#xD;
did later, I should have faced the risk and&#xD;
refused all share in what I suspected from&#xD;
the first was a scheme, against you, despite&#xD;
your own representations of the strong&#xD;
friendship which existed between you and&#xD;
him. What was the nature of that scheme,&#xD;
I know not; I never could form an idea of&#xD;
it. I am not the sort of a man to parade&#xD;
my affections, but I don't think you will&#xD;
doubt my subsequent friendship for you."&#xD;
Charley kept stubborn silence; he was&#xD;
thinking of whtt he might learn from this&#xD;
man, and whether it would repay the effort.&#xD;
Somers was at the end of his rope, sure of&#xD;
nothing and fearful of everything.&#xD;
"One morning you got some news or&#xD;
something that cut you up badly. We&#xD;
went to the Helder afterwards,.and I asked&#xD;
you whether Huntley kept up his 'friendly'&#xD;
correspondence with you; you remember,&#xD;
perhaps -"&#xD;
"Yes, I think I do."&#xD;
"Well, I had it on my lips then to tell&#xD;
you of my suspicions and warn you against&#xD;
him. I knew him - my God! I should&#xD;
think so! He ruined my life, and I expected&#xD;
nothing less than that he would ruin yours.&#xD;
Well, you remembered an engagement at the&#xD;
]3aronne's, and left inc at the critical mo-&#xD;
ment, and I never had the courage to do it&#xD;
afterwards."&#xD;
"You would have saved much pain to&#xD;
several persons, if you had," said Chancy,&#xD;
quietly, looking at his watch as he spoke.&#xD;
Somers noted the movement, and sr~id&#xD;
with bitter dejection, "My position was&#xD;
a hard one, you could not know how&#xD;
hard."&#xD;
"No, I could only suspect," said Charley,&#xD;
rising; "something dating back to the nota-&#xD;
ble association of Somers and Delafield per-&#xD;
haps. There, never mind; it is quite out&#xD;
of my way, and it is only with him I have&#xD;
to deal. So far as you are concerned, I am&#xD;
willing to take you at your word as being a&#xD;
victim of that infernal scoundrel; it could&#xD;
hardly be a nice position, and I am sorry for&#xD;
you. I must go now; I am going over to&#xD;
London by the afternoon express. Y-ou&#xD;
can have my things packed up and sent to&#xD;
store at the bank at your convenience. It&#xD;
is not likely we shall ever meet again; so&#xD;
good by, old fellow."&#xD;
"But - Charley - a moment -"&#xD;
"I really have n't more time, Ned. I&#xD;
would n't miss the train for all Paris, and I&#xD;
&#xD;
don't think we need to talk any more. I&#xD;
bear you no ill-will; we are good quits,&#xD;
adieu 1"&#xD;
Poor Ned Somers! many a shattered&#xD;
dream had marked his earthly pilgrhnage,&#xD;
and many a disappointment darkened the&#xD;
day that followed a rosy morning, but few&#xD;
more bitter than this. Ever hopeful as he&#xD;
was, he had watched patiently all these&#xD;
days for Charley's return, and doubted not.&#xD;
And the cherished picture of the future,&#xD;
the " seigniorial dignities," the metamor-&#xD;
phosed chateau dearer than those of Spain,&#xD;
the "boar-steaks" and the red, red wines&#xD;
of matchless Chambertin, all glowed as&#xD;
brightly as ever in his prophetic soul, more&#xD;
brightly even, since the "stomach" was no&#xD;
more. It was a big hope that swelled the&#xD;
colossal heart, and it died hard. Voisin's&#xD;
menu was rubbish that day; and for the first&#xD;
time ir~ the memory of man, l'aimahle Anglais&#xD;
lost his temper over a paltry matter of&#xD;
francs at pcquet at the club. Some dayl&#xD;
later he went rather less joyously than&#xD;
usual down to the loved shades of Trouville-&#xD;
sur-mner. Let us hope that there was a&#xD;
balm in Calvados for the bruised heart; in&#xD;
these pages he appears no more.&#xD;
Charley found an unsatisfactory state of&#xD;
things at Boulogne. A gale was blowing&#xD;
up channel, and there was a doul)t about&#xD;
starting ~the boats; but some titled digni-&#xD;
tary, who ha1)pcned tc be en route, exercised&#xD;
the " divine right " w~th coi~shle'able spirit,&#xD;
and the potency of rank, if it could not quite&#xD;
still the sea, made the ship to go down&#xD;
thereon, much to, Chancy's satisfaction.&#xD;
The crossing was perilous, and occupied&#xD;
twice the ordinary time, so that he reached&#xD;
London full two hours late for the midnight&#xD;
train to the Northwest. There was an-&#xD;
other at an early hour, which he was told&#xD;
would catch the steamer, and he waited in&#xD;
sleepless excitement and at last went off,&#xD;
leaving his luggage behind. Arrived at&#xD;
Liverpool he sped to the steamer office; lie&#xD;
was only just in time, and no accommoda-&#xD;
tions were to be had but a steerage berth.&#xD;
He paid the modest charge for this without&#xD;
wasting a second of time in hesitation, and&#xD;
went aboard in the very last boat.&#xD;
The deck of the broad poop was thronged&#xD;
with cabin passengers, and from his position&#xD;
below he scanned the faces with a heating&#xD;
heart. He did not see those he sought, but&#xD;
he knew they she was there; he had seen&#xD;
the names on the list at the office; and now,&#xD;
as he made his way across the busy open&#xD;
deck to a quiet corner, they greeted his&#xD;
eyes again from the billets of a great multi-&#xD;
tude of portmanteaus. He got away by&#xD;
himself and leaned against the bulwark as&#xD;
the vessel slowly gathered her huge strength&#xD;
and swung around in the stream. His heart&#xD;
was full of gladness and unutterable con-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
IN THE HOLLOW HAND.&#xD;
&#xD;
tent, and a thrill of ecstasy traversed his&#xD;
heart as they swung clear of the shipping&#xD;
and moved off with the bow to the west.&#xD;
No chance could part them now; he was&#xD;
there with herr once more with her, and in&#xD;
that strangely binding atmosphere of ship-&#xD;
life; there to see her, to breathe the air she&#xD;
breathed, and sleep within the sound of her&#xD;
voice, to watch and guard and save her.&#xD;
Above all the roar of voices and the deep&#xD;
thunder of those never-silent shafts and cyl-&#xD;
inders, above the rush of the winds and the&#xD;
sharp flapping of the unfurled sails, one sin-&#xD;
gle voice spoke and re-echoed in his heart:&#xD;
"She is here! She is with you I Lose her&#xD;
not again!"&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
IN TIlE HOLLOW HAND.&#xD;
CITAnLEY lost no time in hunting up a&#xD;
functionary, and happened on the head-&#xD;
steward, to whom he stated his case, making it&#xD;
peculimrly attractive by the graceful transfer&#xD;
of a five~pound note. lIe was provided forth-&#xD;
with with an odd berth in the steward's cabin&#xD;
for the first night, with the promise of an&#xD;
arran(reinent which should secure him cabin&#xD;
accommodations on the morrow; to the&#xD;
table and poop free access at once was&#xD;
un(lcrstood; the steward would explain&#xD;
matters to the captain directly.&#xD;
Then Charley reflected: eventual recog-&#xD;
nition seemed inevitable if he became an&#xD;
inmate of the cabin, and recognition meant&#xD;
exposure on the instant for Iluntley. 'Would&#xD;
it be well? The temptation to go in there,&#xD;
where she moved and slept, was welinigh&#xD;
irresistible; yet did lie resist it, for he&#xD;
thought of the shame aad pain to which&#xD;
it midit subject Emma and Mrs. Jennings,&#xD;
and 17e felt the moral impossibility of taking&#xD;
a recognized place by Huntley's side among&#xD;
them and holding his peace. It were less&#xD;
difficult, though it was hard, to bear the&#xD;
brief; self-imposed banishment, even with&#xD;
the galling thought of that soulless villain&#xD;
standing in relations of intimacy with his&#xD;
cousin. What these were he did not know,&#xD;
and only half surmised; but he was begin- I&#xD;
ning to see through the dark mists of the&#xD;
past eighteen months pretty clearly; and ic&#xD;
all his righteous hatred for the man, he did&#xD;
not ignore his powers. They were not mar-&#xD;
ried: how God had been thanked for that!&#xD;
And never for a moment did the belief tor-&#xD;
meat him that she loved him. I&#xD;
He weighed his thoughts well, and then c&#xD;
arranged with the stewards to keep his&#xD;
berth among them, and also to dine with L&#xD;
their mess, giving up the cabin entirely, a&#xD;
and to this plan he accommodated himself s&#xD;
with great success. He also got a hat from t&#xD;
one of them to replace his thin, silk tray- s&#xD;
&#xD;
115&#xD;
&#xD;
elling-cap, - a wide, black Van Dyck, which&#xD;
was at once comfortable and picturesque,&#xD;
- and after sleeping the night through like&#xD;
a babe, he mounted the bridge-deck the fol-&#xD;
lowing morning at Qucenstown and tested&#xD;
the completeness of his disguise by passing&#xD;
before Huntley, who was smoking a medi-&#xD;
tative cigar thereon. The niomentary cx-&#xD;
citement in Charley's bosom, as he encoun-&#xD;
tered the careless eye of the broker,&#xD;
awakened no corresponding emotion in&#xD;
that gentleman; he noticed simply a rather&#xD;
tall, rather thin, and altogether "seedy"&#xD;
personage with a profusion of dark beard&#xD;
and an absurdly large slouched hat, and&#xD;
associated the figure instinctively with un-&#xD;
successful artistic or literary proclivities.&#xD;
Chancy was exultant and emboldened,&#xD;
while ime also felt more forcibly than before&#xD;
how impossible it would be for him to speak&#xD;
the smiling lies of hypocrisy to this white-&#xD;
faced demon. He extended his restless&#xD;
promenades to the main deck and the gang-&#xD;
way stairs, and persistently followed these&#xD;
lines for the next three days, though quite&#xD;
unrewarded for his pains. The sea was&#xD;
restless like himself, and the cabin people,&#xD;
after their unhappy fashion, nursed them-&#xD;
selves in the pent air of their staterooms.&#xD;
He had still some struggles with himself&#xD;
too, in these days, did Charley; it was&#xD;
agony to think of her just within there,&#xD;
suffering and ill, perhaps a little frightened&#xD;
by the sharp gusts that came chasing after&#xD;
them from the Kerry hills away out to sea,&#xD;
making the good ship plunge and shake her&#xD;
inane. He bribed a steward with a princely&#xD;
hi-ibe for secret reports, and was made fool-&#xD;
ishly happy by the news that she kept&#xD;
strict privacy, and was as invisible to Hunt-&#xD;
ley as himself.&#xD;
"You - you do not seeher?" he asked,&#xD;
with a rather ludicrous disregard of the&#xD;
propniethis.&#xD;
"Me? Why, no; the stewardess tells&#xD;
me, you know."&#xD;
"To be sure; not a word about me, you&#xD;
know, Burns."&#xD;
"I takes you, sir; not a haccenfl"&#xD;
Whereupon Burns improves the first op.&#xD;
3ortunity to enlarge mysteriously on this&#xD;
sident case of the affections to the smiling&#xD;
tewardess, with whom he is desperately&#xD;
~namored. "A gentleman all up his back;&#xD;
hould n't wonder if it wuz a real pelt-&#xD;
neller! Looks like a lay on the hotelier&#xD;
me, don't it? But he 's the real swell."&#xD;
lut the stewardess was wise, and the suspi-&#xD;
io~i went no further.&#xD;
Charhey saw Huntley constantly; but the&#xD;
atter, self-contained as usual, noticed him&#xD;
0 more, nor indeed any one else, but&#xD;
moked endless cigars and walked the decks&#xD;
thoughtfully for hours together. Our hero,&#xD;
ecure in his disguise, watched the man&#xD;

116                   CHOISY.                                              IN THE HOLLOW HAND.&#xD;
&#xD;
with a strange interest, and marvelled at&#xD;
his nature, at once so evil and attractive,&#xD;
and it was in this study that his apprehen-&#xD;
sion of the past grew to a settled conviction.&#xD;
In his long reveries by the rail, with this&#xD;
miracle of craff and deceit pacing before&#xD;
his eyes, his mind ran hack over everylit-&#xD;
tie incident of their connection, resting&#xD;
painfully on that fatal night at Worthing-&#xD;
ton's, struggling to gather the truth from&#xD;
the chaos of its memories. And over that&#xD;
shameful subsequent life he passed, with a&#xD;
shuddering suspicion that in some deep,&#xD;
mysterious way this man's brain had guided&#xD;
it. lie was only human; and with this&#xD;
feeling in his soul, there came sometimes a&#xD;
mad desire to face the wretch in his ner-&#xD;
vous walk and hurl the accusation in his&#xD;
face. But he did better, saving his strength&#xD;
for the day of reckoning, and girding him-&#xD;
self with patience.&#xD;
He was at his jealous post on the bridge-&#xD;
deck, the fourth morning out, at an early&#xD;
hour. The sea had fallen in the night, and&#xD;
the bright, sunny morning had awakened&#xD;
bright, sunny hopes in his heart. Standing&#xD;
thus, and guarding the cabin gangway with&#xD;
hungry eyes, lie felt his heart leap suddenly&#xD;
to his throat with one upward plunge that&#xD;
sent the blood flashing through all hi~&#xD;
veins, and, fairly dizzy, he leaned on the&#xD;
rail beside him, as two slight figures&#xD;
emerged and climbed awkwardly to the&#xD;
deck above, both marked by the pallor of&#xD;
illness, both ludicrously unsteady on their&#xD;
feet, but merry with laughter, and rejoicing&#xD;
in their escape from the cabin. Just as&#xD;
he had seen her last on the Italian hill,&#xD;
with the sea-wind tossing her hair, and an&#xD;
amused smile parting her lips, she stood&#xD;
with an arm laced in that of Clare, and&#xD;
looked out wonderingly on the waves, while&#xD;
her companion chattered like a free bird,&#xD;
and broke out into peals of ringing laughter&#xD;
at each little clumsy stagger. Poor Char-&#xD;
Icy! It was hard to stand there with&#xD;
strained eyes and beating heart, watching&#xD;
the dear, familiar faces, and crushing down&#xD;
the longing to fly across to them which filled&#xD;
his heart, and shook him like a tempest.&#xD;
A smothered exclamation near him caught&#xD;
his ear; and Huntley, tossing away his cigar,&#xD;
passed swiftly with an expression of mingled&#xD;
pleasure and vexation on his face. The&#xD;
sight braced him, and he sauntered across&#xD;
with well-affected carelessness and took up&#xD;
his regular promenade on the main deck,&#xD;
where he could glance up at the faces just&#xD;
above him, as he passed. He had twice&#xD;
traversed his little beat, when Emma's eyes,&#xD;
coming home from the sea, looked down&#xD;
and met his own just when he was nearest.&#xD;
She gave a little start and an exclamation, as&#xD;
he passed on; then he heard Huntley make&#xD;
some remark which brought a quick laugh&#xD;
&#xD;
from Clare, but none, as his l~eart told him,&#xD;
from the other. He paused by the bulwark&#xD;
to let the flush die out of his face, and then&#xD;
returned on his path and met the gaze of&#xD;
all three bravely. He rocked lift le of&#xD;
Huntley's or Clare's, but in EmmiVs he read&#xD;
something which thrilled him to the soul.&#xD;
What was it? Commiseration, curiosity,&#xD;
eagerness, all were there, and something else!&#xD;
The look unmanned him, frightened him,&#xD;
indeed, and he hurried forward to hide&#xD;
himself. Every day now they came on&#xD;
deck, and every day Chancy walked his&#xD;
beat, and was rewarded with that soft,&#xD;
puzzled glance from Emma. He had even&#xD;
seen her eyes fixed on him while he leaned&#xD;
over the side' in the pauses of his march,&#xD;
and, without daring to ask himself its mean-&#xD;
ing, he carried the memory of it warm&#xD;
his heart, and dreamed on it at night.&#xD;
They had smooth and delightful seas before&#xD;
coming on the Banks, and the evenings&#xD;
were lovely beyond description, the great&#xD;
ship careering landward beneath a moonlit&#xD;
sky and over a silver sea. Chancy strayed&#xD;
into the forecastle (where he had long since&#xD;
"paid his footing" with more thaa one&#xD;
largess of "Jamaica ") on one of these&#xD;
nights, while mirth and sailor-music filled&#xD;
the hour with the "watch below." They&#xD;
knew him there, and hailed his coming with&#xD;
a volley of rough welcomes, followed by&#xD;
loud calls for a song; and it would have&#xD;
warmed the hearts of those who know the&#xD;
hard truths of" foksul" life to have seen the&#xD;
silent enjoyment with which the poor fellows&#xD;
listened to Charley's ready songs, those&#xD;
familiar, plaintive home-ballads which are&#xD;
as dear to Jack's heart as double grog. Un-&#xD;
noticed by Charley, some of the passengers&#xD;
had come forward with an officer; Jiuntley&#xD;
was among them; and at the conclusion of a&#xD;
motley chorus, in which the seamen brought&#xD;
their weird minor notes into a strikingfinale&#xD;
to Charley's solo, Huntley pressed them to&#xD;
select a number of voices and come out to&#xD;
the main deck for the entertainment of the&#xD;
cabin. The men were only too glad of the&#xD;
chance, and only waited for the officer's&#xD;
permission, which was freely accorded. A&#xD;
group was then formed about the after&#xD;
hatchway, which boasted several very good&#xD;
untrained voices, with a surprising banjo-&#xD;
p~ ayer and a clever violinist by way of&#xD;
orchestra; and Charley having accepted the&#xD;
leadership, an impromptu concert was given,&#xD;
heartily enjoyed by the cabin-passengers,&#xD;
who swarmed out upon the poop above.&#xD;
There is a marvellous pathos in these&#xD;
cherished songs of below-decks, which are&#xD;
literally the sailors' hymns. Poor Foster is&#xD;
the saving genius of the forecastle, and his&#xD;
homely melodies wifl echo still on the seas&#xD;
when they are all but forgotten ashore.&#xD;

"Not so bad to-night," said the broker&#xD;
in a friendly tone.&#xD;
"No," returned Charley, in a low anc&#xD;
indistinct voice. He would have giver&#xD;
worlds to get away.&#xD;
"We shall o'ct in in good time to-morron&#xD;

"I wished to see von before we left thc&#xD;

"and thank you for your share of the enter.&#xD;
tainment the other evening, for the Indies&#xD;

"I am very glad," responded Charley, in&#xD;
the same low tone.&#xD;
"Excuse me, I did n't hear you -&#xD;
Huntley bent his head close to Charley's&#xD;
face as he spoke.&#xD;
"I said I was glad that they were&#xD;
pleased," shouted our hero.&#xD;
At the same instant the other gave a&#xD;
strong pull at his cigar which flashed a mo-&#xD;
mentary glare in Charley's face. After&#xD;
this there was a silence.&#xD;
"It 's no use, Charley," said Huntley,&#xD;
after the pause, in a tone intended to be&#xD;
kindly; "I have suspected you ever since&#xD;
the night you sang, and now I'm sure of&#xD;
you, though you are terribly altered. Why&#xD;
in the world did you not let us know? 'I&#xD;
fear you have been in distress on the voy-&#xD;
age. Surely you must have known me!"&#xD;
Charley was silent, stunned, and full of&#xD;
speechless wrath.&#xD;
"Come!" cried Huntley, "I am waiting&#xD;
to shake hands; you don't dream of trying&#xD;
the disguise any longer, do you? We '11 go&#xD;
below and have a toddy and a cigar, and&#xD;
talk over the hiatus. I 'm all eagerness to&#xD;
hear the story of your adventures!" Still&#xD;
no response, and Huntley said quietly, "I&#xD;
hope you have n't put me in your bad books,&#xD;
old fellow; I don't deserve that. Besides, I&#xD;
am going to be your cousin, Charley, and&#xD;
we must be friends -"&#xD;
"You d-d infernal scoundrel I" yelled&#xD;
Charley, his cool blood rising to fever heat;&#xD;
"what do you mean?"&#xD;
Huntley drew, back slightly, but spoke&#xD;
quickly. "I might rather ask what you&#xD;
mean; my meaning is simply that I am&#xD;
going to marry your cousin, and -"&#xD;
"Never!&#xD;
Huntley puffed his cigar coolly. Was it&#xD;
worth his time to waste words on this aban-&#xD;
doned boy, who, very likely, was half drunk&#xD;
at that moment, on the rtim of the fore-&#xD;
castle?&#xD;
"Why not?" he asked, shortly.&#xD;
"For a hundred reasons!" cried Char-&#xD;
ley, who was clenching his fists in the dark.&#xD;
"Because you are a villain, and, as I suspect,&#xD;
a convicted one, and because you have a&#xD;
wife living!"&#xD;
&#xD;
Huntley started violently, but recovered&#xD;
himself on the instant.&#xD;
"You have evidently acquired some ac-&#xD;
complishments in your gay career," he said&#xD;
with a cold sneer; "you were not so ready&#xD;
with a lie once."&#xD;
Charley gave way under this, and struck&#xD;
at the man with all his strength. Huntley&#xD;
reeled under the blow, but closed with him&#xD;
like a tiger and forced him sharply against&#xD;
the boats bow.&#xD;
"Will you have done, you fool ?" he&#xD;
cried, hoarsely.&#xD;
Charley tore an arm loose, and, seizing&#xD;
the other by the throat, held him back for&#xD;
an instant. All the demon in his nature was&#xD;
aroused.&#xD;
"I know you, Robert Delafleld alias "&#xD;
At the name, Huntley gathered himself in&#xD;
a spasm of strength and fell on Chancy&#xD;
with resistless force. Always powerful, he&#xD;
seemed to have redoubled might in his arms;&#xD;
and Chancy, weakened by long illness, was&#xD;
a mere child in his grasp. in an instant&#xD;
Huntleyhad wrenched the handfrom his neck&#xD;
mmd lifted the young man with one tremendous&#xD;
wrench from the deck. They were close at&#xD;
the rail; and without a spoken word the&#xD;
Englishman raised his victim and hurled&#xD;
him over. Charley clutched frantically at&#xD;
his opponent, and caught a momentary hold&#xD;
on his sleeve; shaken from this he clutched&#xD;
at the rail, but missed it, and went down&#xD;
the ship's side without a cry. The moon&#xD;
was entirely obscured and the steamer&#xD;
shrouded in darkness as Huntley bent over&#xD;
and strained eye and ear for a last sign of&#xD;
his victim. There was none; nothing but&#xD;
the inky darkness, the rush of the water&#xD;
through which the ship was ploughing at&#xD;
high speed, and the dun wake of white&#xD;
foam behind, along which he ran his gaze&#xD;
until it was lost in the blackness. lie drew&#xD;
a long, hard breath and wiped the moisture&#xD;
from his forehead, where a great lump had&#xD;

"Not a sound!" he muttered; "the&#xD;
screw must have crushed him on the instant.&#xD;
He will not come back again this time!"&#xD;
He went away quickly from the spot.&#xD;
Even in his hardened heart the conscious-&#xD;
ness of his fearful deed began already to&#xD;
breed its nameless terrors, and he hurried&#xD;
from that vast and awful presence where an&#xD;
accusing voice seemed to arise in every&#xD;
wave. As he passed the officer at the bin-&#xD;
nacle, the latter said, " Good evening," and&#xD;
asked if "Mr. Thompson" was not "over&#xD;
there aft"?&#xD;
Huntley shivered, but replied calmly, "I&#xD;
think not:1 saw no one."&#xD;
"Ah!" was the dry rejoinde~. The sail-&#xD;
or's practiced eye rarely deceived him, dud&#xD;
he had seen the two figures by the cutter in&#xD;
a flash of moonlight just before. He waited&#xD;

&#xD;
public eye in simple text, with the supple-&#xD;
mentary information that the said gentleman&#xD;
was not to be found on any floor inferior to&#xD;
the classic fourth. My "business hours"&#xD;
were from ten to three; my hours of business&#xD;
are quite another matter, of which it is not&#xD;
here necessary to speak.&#xD;
I was alone in my outer office on a certain&#xD;
day in July, 186-, the same on which at an&#xD;
earlier hour the steamer --, of the' Guion&#xD;
line, had come to moorings in the savory vi-&#xD;
cinage of Desbrosses Street. As the perusal&#xD;
of the shipping' list in ~o way entered into&#xD;
my habits at t~at time, I was probably un-&#xD;
aware of' this maritime fact; certainly I was&#xD;
far from suspecting that it possessed any pos-&#xD;
sible interest for me, being, as I distinctly&#xD;
remember, deeply engrossed at the moment&#xD;
in a case of small dimensions but sufficiently&#xD;
perplexing nature, wherein an irate landlady&#xD;
of a "quiet locality," and an obtuse neigh-&#xD;
bor of questionable character, were the par-&#xD;
ties litigant. I had, as I further remember,&#xD;
almost exhausted the field of expedients&#xD;
and my own temper in the study of the&#xD;
momentous problem, and felt a growing&#xD;
consciousness that lunch-time was fully&#xD;
arrived, when the door opened suddenly&#xD;
and there entered unto me a gentleman.&#xD;
The first glance at the stranger's ensemble&#xD;
was inspiring; I was refreshed, indeed, by&#xD;
his very foreign and really unique appear-&#xD;
ance. The exceptional is always attractive,&#xD;
and never more so, perhaps, than in a law-&#xD;
yer's office, where it is dimly suggestive of&#xD;
something out of the common in the way&#xD;
of causes and cases, fees and charges.&#xD;
I salamed the visitor, and placed a chair,&#xD;
which courtesies he gracefully ignored; he&#xD;
removed an avalanche of' hat, and, coming&#xD;
up to me, administered a vigorous slap on&#xD;
my back.&#xD;
"So you don't know me, either! Egad!&#xD;
1 might~as well be Rip Van Winkle! How&#xD;
are you, Harry? My name&#xD;
"Is wonder! I 'd never have known&#xD;
you, Charley; but I 'm awfully glad to see&#xD;
you, all the same. From what heathen pos-&#xD;
session do you come?"&#xD;
"No worse thaim England. But how are&#xD;
you and everybody and the babies?"&#xD;
The young man's exuberance was trying,&#xD;
with the mercury at 850.&#xD;
"I am well; 'everybody(' is always well,&#xD;
I believe; as for the babie~, Charles I for&#xD;
what do you take me? Why am I thus -"&#xD;
"Sinner! I had hoped you were reformed;&#xD;
bachelorhood and its sinful indulgences still&#xD;
keep their hold on you. Speaking of indul-&#xD;
gences, have you lunched?"&#xD;
"I was just going; will you join me?"&#xD;
"You anticipate me; now that I think&#xD;
of it, 1 have fasted since last evening. I&#xD;
have a queer story to tell you, Harry, and&#xD;
work for you also, - work that must be done&#xD;
&#xD;
quickly. Can you give me a day or two&#xD;
of your time?"&#xD;
"Only too glad; but since you are fasting,&#xD;
let 's go across to Del's at once; the fatted&#xD;
calves will be all served before the tardy&#xD;
prodigal arrives.&#xD;
I need not have used the word; it slipped&#xD;
out in the usual way when one is trying to&#xD;
be "funny" I&#xD;
"Do you see my father, Harry? Is he&#xD;
well?" he asked just afterwards, as we were&#xD;
crossing the Park.&#xD;
"You have n't seen -? 0, he is as&#xD;
usual, I think; I saw him at the office a&#xD;
few days since."&#xD;
"A strange questions was n't it?" said&#xD;
Charley, smiling. "I 'ye enough that 's&#xD;
strange to tell you."&#xD;
As we went in at the familiar Chambers&#xD;
Street portal, he asked, "Do you remem-&#xD;
ber the last night I saw you at the May-&#xD;
flower, when I had just come up town with&#xD;
Dick Huntley, after dining here?"&#xD;
"Yes, very well; we were all very much&#xD;
cut up by your sudden taking off. By the&#xD;
way, where is iluntley? 1 suppose you&#xD;
met him abroad."&#xD;
My information respecting Charley was&#xD;
that of the gossips, and I hesitated to a~k&#xD;
several questions which arose in my mind.&#xD;
I thought this a safe one.&#xD;
"Lie is here in New York; we arrived&#xD;
by the same steamer, though by no fault of&#xD;
his, Dieu sait! Thereby hangs my tale."&#xD;
We were a long time over our luncheon;&#xD;
Quill, who is my office-boy, clerk, and&#xD;
copyist, and who awaits my return accord-&#xD;
ing to regulations before running down to&#xD;
Gould's for his frugal bowl of clam soup,&#xD;
evinced an amount of feeling I had never&#xD;
before observed in him when our return to&#xD;
the office relieved his watch. Chancy told&#xD;
me a part of' his story over our wine, and&#xD;
completed the narrative in my sanctum. I&#xD;
need not repeat any of' the details, which&#xD;
are already known to the reader; he stated&#xD;
them to me minutely; and more clearly than&#xD;
be, perhaps, I traced the guiding hand from&#xD;
the gambling-house to the very end. The&#xD;
deep game was worthy of Huntley, and&#xD;
murder in a terrible form its fitting cli-&#xD;
max.&#xD;
"Now," said Charley, at the close of the&#xD;
recital, lighting his fifth cigar with a certain&#xD;
satisfaction, "what is to be done? I leave&#xD;
it to you entirely; but let it be done spee&amp;amp;&#xD;
ily; ''t were well 't were done quickly I'"&#xD;
"'There would have been a time for such&#xD;
a word, to-morrow,'" I retorted; "we need&#xD;
not be driven; the fact that he believes you&#xD;
in the Atlantic will prevent him from push-&#xD;
ing matters."&#xD;
"But 1 dread every instant's delay! I&#xD;
can't bear to think he is here, free, and&#xD;
near my cousin.&#xD;
&#xD;
I smiled in secret at the soft emphasis on&#xD;
"cousin," but made no sign.&#xD;
"Well, if' I understand you, you don't&#xD;
wish to go at bun in legal form."&#xD;
"No, not if we can avoid it; anything&#xD;
but publicity."&#xD;
I reflected a moment, and not without a&#xD;
little pang of regret; to have sent him to&#xD;
Sing Sing for life, this villain of the premier&#xD;
ordre, in a blazing speech to the bench!&#xD;
"Do you want to see the man?" I asked&#xD;
Chancy.&#xD;
"No, indeed! that is, I am indifferent;&#xD;
as you elect."&#xD;
" We can warn him off' &amp;amp;"~ him our&#xD;
hand, and give him three, five, or 'seven&#xD;
days to leave the country, and se~ 2~at he&#xD;
does it, and all without seeing him."&#xD;
Charley pondered, and was evidently&#xD;
unsatisfied.&#xD;
"It 's letting him off with nothing;&#xD;
besides, I want in some way to be able to&#xD;
show up the facts to my father, and, if&#xD;
necessary, to - to the others."&#xD;
"Then it 's a confession signed and wit-&#xD;
nessed; not an easy thing to manage, if 1&#xD;
know the man.~~&#xD;
"We must try it. rut it squarely to&#xD;
him, - that or arraignment. He does n't&#xD;
know that Curtis saw the affair."&#xD;
"Or that you are alive, for that matter.&#xD;
I think we might cow him by a combination.&#xD;
Curtis will help us?"&#xD;
"The good fellow will do anything; he&#xD;
promised it, in the name of all the Apostles!"&#xD;
"Good! now the details."&#xD;
These were very simple; I wrote two&#xD;
notes, one to Curtis on the steamer, and&#xD;
another to a man of my choice at the&#xD;
Detective Agency.&#xD;
The afternoon was spent, and we went&#xD;
up town together to my quarters, which&#xD;
Chancy agreed to share for the present.&#xD;
1.Ve dined later in an obscure corner at the&#xD;
hoffman, and in the evening I a~com-&#xD;
panied him in a walk up the Avenue,&#xD;
rea(lily divining, the impulse which led his&#xD;
steps in that direction. As we were pass-&#xD;
ing his father's house, a figure appeared in&#xD;
the doorway. Before I could breathe a&#xD;
caution, Chancy sprang up two steps and&#xD;
called in a low voice, "Stephen!"&#xD;
The old man stood mute ~ moment, and&#xD;
then caine down the steps like a boy of ten.&#xD;
"Mr. Charles!"&#xD;
"'Sh! It 's I, sure enough, bless your&#xD;
01(1 heart! I shall be home again in a few&#xD;
days, and you must not speak of seeing me.&#xD;
has - has Mr. Huntley been here yet,&#xD;
Stephen?"&#xD;
"No, sir; he arrived in the steamer with&#xD;
the ladies, but did not come to the house.&#xD;
He is expected this evening, I think, sir."&#xD;
"Listen, Stephen; if he comes he must&#xD;
not be admitted. Tell him Miss Emma is&#xD;
16&#xD;
&#xD;
unwell; anything, but make some excuse&#xD;
and keep him out."&#xD;
"But, Mr. Charles-."&#xD;
"Never mind, I will take the entire re-&#xD;
sponsibility, and you need have no fear.&#xD;
You can trust me, can't you, Stephen?"&#xD;
"You know I would do that, Mr. Charles."&#xD;
"On no account admit him. I must go&#xD;
now; I shall conic home to stay very soon."&#xD;
"God bless you, sir, I hope so; we have&#xD;
grown old without you, Mi'. Charles." The&#xD;
faithful old fellow's voice was tremulous as&#xD;
he spoke. Charley paused at the words.&#xD;
"My father is well?"&#xD;
"About as usual, sir; he 's not so strong&#xD;
as he was. You are well, I hope, sir."&#xD;
"Quite; not a word, mind, and remember&#xD;
about --"&#xD;
"I won't fail, Mr. Charles."&#xD;
Charley was exultant as we walked on.&#xD;
"You can't think what a relief it is!"&#xD;
he said; "it was horrible to think of that&#xD;
wretch beino' admitted there again. Old&#xD;
Stephen is ~s good as gold; Huntley ivihl&#xD;
not get in there to-night, you may be sure."&#xD;
"Nor to-morrow," 1 responded, sharing&#xD;
something of his feeling.&#xD;
"0 that 'to-porrow'! I ache for it!"&#xD;
It would come soon enough, as all to-mor-&#xD;
rows do, despite the maxims; and I confessed&#xD;
to a rather disagreeable foretaste' of its task&#xD;
in my mind, though I gave the feeling no&#xD;
words in the long evening of pleasant talk&#xD;
which we enjoyed amid the chaste sur-&#xD;
roundings of Coelebs' chambers. So much&#xD;
tobacco-smoke and such unconscionable&#xD;
hours, I may honestly aver, were strictly&#xD;
exceptional under my modest roof-tree.&#xD;
Huntley was not a little nonplussed, when&#xD;
he arrived at the house on the Avenue1 to&#xD;
he informed by Stephen, with much nervous&#xD;
and rather extravagant politeness, that Miss&#xD;
Howland was" much fatigued, and begged to&#xD;
be excused," and that Mr. Wales had "just&#xD;
stepped out on unavoidable business, and&#xD;
left, his regrets." He went away in a bail&#xD;
humor, asking himself angrily if it was&#xD;
usual for young ladies to "excuse" them-&#xD;
selves to their fiance's, or for sober bankers&#xD;
to appoint evening interviews, as Mr. Wales&#xD;
had done that day, at the office, and be&#xD;
absent on "business" when the hour ar-&#xD;
rived. In other days he would have in-&#xD;
sisted upon the absurdity of such anomalies,&#xD;
and poor old Stephen's little fraud would&#xD;
have fhhlen through, it is to be feared;&#xD;
but the broker had no heart this night to&#xD;
assert his opinions or his rights. He had&#xD;
borne himself bravely all the day, had seen&#xD;
the ladies ashore and in their carriage, with&#xD;
a smiling promise to call in the evening, and&#xD;
covered with a witticism the bruise on his&#xD;
temple that the "boom" had given him.&#xD;
Then in a round of business calls, reports&#xD;

122                         CHOISY.&#xD;
&#xD;
of his successful transactions abroad to&#xD;
divers financial potentates, and a rapid&#xD;
running over of the books in his own office,&#xD;
he so carried himself as to win the com-&#xD;
mendation of all with whom he came in&#xD;
contact.&#xD;
But with the shadows of night arose the&#xD;
demon of' unrest. Thrown back upon him-&#xD;
self; with all his thoughts massed in one&#xD;
horrible memory, the struggle for control&#xD;
became an unequal combat, an agony. He&#xD;
had even feared to make the visit at the&#xD;
Wales mansion, called himself a fool after-&#xD;
wards, and,, braced by a deep draught of&#xD;
brandy, started boldly for the house.&#xD;
"It will wear off," he muttered.&#xD;
Coming down the steps after hearing&#xD;
Stephen's messages, he glanced across the&#xD;
way, and noted signs of life and gayety in&#xD;
Mrs. Jennings's lighted parlors. He felt&#xD;
tempted to enter there, but some counter-&#xD;
impulse prevailed, and he kept on down&#xD;
the street. His uneasy feet wandered to&#xD;
Worthington's, but he found the house&#xD;
empty of people, with only a few lazy ser-&#xD;
vants about, who vexed him with curious&#xD;
looks and fawning attentions; the master&#xD;
himself was out of town, with the world.&#xD;
He stretched himself in the private room&#xD;
above and drank furiously; but the solitude&#xD;
maddened him, and he went out soon again&#xD;
into the streets. Then he strayed in at Wal-&#xD;
lack's; the play was "The Colleen Bawn,"&#xD;
and he came into the lobby at the moment&#xD;
of the drowning scene, which he watched&#xD;
with fascinated eyes. Some acquaintances&#xD;
found him out and drove him wild with&#xD;
questions. One noticed the contusion on&#xD;
his forehead.&#xD;
"It 's the mark of Cain," he said, with a&#xD;
bitter laugh, and went out.&#xD;
"By Jove! one might almost believe it!"&#xD;
said the questioner, recalling the man's&#xD;
face.&#xD;
He wandered for hours with aimless but&#xD;
vigorous steps, drinking recklessly and ig-&#xD;
norant of his whereabouts, until some con-&#xD;
genial instinct led him into the glittering&#xD;
haunts of vice of the West side. Here, as&#xD;
the central figure of wild and horrible rev-&#xD;
els, invoked by his open purse, he experi-&#xD;
rieneed a momentary distractionn.&#xD;
Long after midnight he found himself at&#xD;
a far corner of Broadway, overcome with&#xD;
weariness, but with the same awful unrest&#xD;
in his brain; it had worn out the body and&#xD;
raged still with unabated force. He took a&#xD;
hack to his lodgings. "I must sleep," he&#xD;
said; "but how?"&#xD;
He got out at Union Square, and under&#xD;
the light of a lamp on a blank page torn&#xD;
from a letter wrote a prescription in tech-&#xD;
nical terms, signing it with illegible initials.&#xD;
The sleepy clerk at Hegeman's did not&#xD;
recognize the writing or letters, but the&#xD;
&#xD;
appearance of the applicant was satisfactory,&#xD;
and the mixture only a powerful sedative.&#xD;
"I wish it immediately; the patient is in&#xD;
great pain," said Huntley.&#xD;
It was prepared and given to him, and he&#xD;
rode to his rooms~ Here he lighted a blaze&#xD;
of gas, and, taking the opiate at a swallow,&#xD;
threw himself half dressed on his bed. The&#xD;
effect of the potion was like that of a gas, -&#xD;
it spent itself in thirty minutes, leaving him&#xD;
worse than before. He bounded out of bed.&#xD;
"Fool! never to have thought of it!" He&#xD;
went to his secretary and from a drawer&#xD;
produced a bi~ou medicine-chest. Out of&#xD;
this he chose a small vial, and a tiny in-&#xD;
jector with a tube like a needle, and wfth&#xD;
these returning to his bed he sat down upon&#xD;
the edge. Then he bared his left arm, -&#xD;
even in his semi-delirium his hand was&#xD;
steady as steel, - and filling the miniature&#xD;
instrument from the bottle he drove the&#xD;
point through a prominent vein, and forced&#xD;
the fluid into the wound. Quickly placing&#xD;
the things on his bed-stand, he rolled over&#xD;
upon the couch, and in a moment was sunk&#xD;
in slumber, deep and dreamless as death&#xD;
itself.&#xD;
I sent a note to Mr. Huntley at the office&#xD;
of Huntley &amp;amp; Co. the following morning,&#xD;
begging that he would call at my office at&#xD;
three o'clock that day, "on a matter of the&#xD;
first importance to himself, R. S. V. P."&#xD;
He had not yet come down town when it&#xD;
was delivered, but at noon I received a&#xD;
line from him, saying that he would come&#xD;
at the hour appointed, or as soon afterwards&#xD;
as possible.&#xD;
He came very promptly, and greeted me&#xD;
with his customary easy grace, a slight club-&#xD;
acquaintance having subsisted between us;&#xD;
but I was struck by the alteration in his&#xD;
face, which had lost something of its iron&#xD;
rigidity, and its usual pallor had become&#xD;
lividness.&#xD;
"Ah! how are you?" he said. "I am&#xD;
prompt, am I not? although I come in fear&#xD;
and trembling, as becomes one who enters&#xD;
into the august presence of Justice. What&#xD;
is it, Meegs? I half suspect, you know.&#xD;
Some of my clerks in my absence -?"&#xD;
There was a vague uneasiness, almost a&#xD;
dread, expressed. in his face and tone that&#xD;
gave me a chill. I had never before met&#xD;
murder face to face, and I shrank a little at&#xD;
the contact. "Sit down, Mr. Huntley,"I&#xD;
said, giving him a seat somewhat in the rear&#xD;
of my large writing-table; "it is a suffi-&#xD;
ciently serious affair."&#xD;
He sat down silently, and at the same&#xD;
moment I gave a short cough. The door of&#xD;
the inner room opened at the sound, and&#xD;
the officer Curtis came in, followed by Char-&#xD;
hey in the same dress he had worn on the&#xD;
steamer. Can a man be frightened to death?&#xD;

as he bent his head without meeting our none, as I saw at once t~hat the diversion&#xD;
gaze. Charley, I saw, avoided looking at had its effect on Huntley. He glanced at&#xD;
him; but Curtis watched him closely with the sailor, and winced under the man's&#xD;
his gray eyes in sober curiosity, steady eyes.&#xD;
"What do you want of me?" he asked "If I sign this," he said, hurriedly, "I&#xD;

refuse. We are wasting time and grace on&#xD;
you.&#xD;
I called Quill, and he ushered in a second&#xD;
patient gentleman, who bowed, but re-&#xD;
niaine(1 aloof by the door. Huntley noted&#xD;
him with a quick glance. He hesitated still&#xD;
a moment, with a simply reckless impulse&#xD;
to fight to the last; but some other thought&#xD;
decided him, and, seizing a pen, he signed&#xD;
the confession boldly.&#xD;
"Accepted under protest, gentlemen, and&#xD;
not so much because I fear your ability to&#xD;
prove the pretty lies, as because of the law's&#xD;
delays, which I know you are so capable of&#xD;
employing." He even laughed while Curtis&#xD;
and myself signed the paper as witnesses.&#xD;
"It is to be hoped you ~vill severally en-&#xD;
joy the recompense of your kindly offices.&#xD;
Egad! it 's like the 'butcher, the baker, and&#xD;
candlestick-maker'! Working thus in a&#xD;
trio, you will allow me to say you make a&#xD;
'whole team'! I suppose 1 may go?"&#xD;
"Of course - only -Mr. Fergusen, Mr.&#xD;
Huntley. Mr. Fergusen will in no way in-&#xD;
convenience you; probably you will not&#xD;
come into contact at all, but it is well you&#xD;
should know him, perhaps, to avoid mis-&#xD;
takes."&#xD;
"Your considerateness overwhelms me.&#xD;
In the language of the journals, Mr. Meegs,&#xD;
you are an ornament to your profession.&#xD;
Gentlemen, I have the honor -&#xD;
Charley stepped up to him at the last&#xD;
moment&#xD;
"Richard Huntley, or Robert Delafield, is&#xD;
it possible that anything I might say could&#xD;
move your heart for the poor woman and&#xD;
children who belong to you?"&#xD;
The Englishman glared at the speaker&#xD;
for an instant with such an expression of&#xD;
hate as I have never seen equalled in a hu-&#xD;
man face. Then he spoke five words, - the&#xD;
reader may thank inc for not printing them&#xD;
here, - and, turning on his heel, went out,&#xD;
followed by the detective.&#xD;
Curtis wiped his head with the bandanna,&#xD;
while Charley brought out some cigars.&#xD;
"Nice lad, that," said the officer; "he&#xD;
'minds me of a Spanish captain we caught&#xD;
on the slave-coast, when I was a boy in the&#xD;
navy. I did n't quite understand your&#xD;
trade, but I hope you are quits with&#xD;
him."&#xD;
There was a rare good dinner served&#xD;
"for three" at Delmonico's presently, dur-&#xD;
ing which the sturdy old sailor warmed into&#xD;
a flow of reminiscences and good-nature.&#xD;
We saw him aboard, later; and when&#xD;
he sailed again that day week he was&#xD;
richer in worldly goods by a handsome&#xD;
chronometer timepiece from Tiffany's, with&#xD;
his own and the donor's name in honorable&#xD;
association graven therein. As long as his&#xD;
precarious life is siiared, Charley Wales has&#xD;
a brave friend in John Curtis.&#xD;
&#xD;
Charley left me at my rooms in the even-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"I must try to see my father to-night:&#xD;
I can't wait."&#xD;
"As you th~nk best, though I don't think&#xD;
you need fear anything more from iluntley&#xD;
in that quart~r. I fancy the Avenue will&#xD;
not see him again."&#xD;
Nor did it. On some business 1)lea cov-&#xD;
ering designs best known to himself he left&#xD;
town the next day, and I received a dispatch&#xD;
from Fergusen in the evening from Newark,&#xD;
in which salubrious city the broker had&#xD;
sought seclusion. Saturday arrived, and I&#xD;
looked anxiously for the detective during&#xD;
the afternoon. He came in at last, and&#xD;
took the offered chair like a tired man.&#xD;
"The bird is gone, eb?" II asked, quickly.&#xD;
"Off, sure enough, and seemed glad to&#xD;
go. You don't think he '11 be much missed&#xD;
down there in Wall Street?"&#xD;
The tone was inquiring.&#xD;
4' I fancy not, he has been out of general&#xD;
business almost entirely for some time."&#xD;
"Perhaps you 're right. I did n't know;&#xD;
he was wonderful shy the last morning in&#xD;
the street. Thank you; it 's liberal. My&#xD;
respects to Mr. Wales. Good day, sir."&#xD;
Did they "miss" him? It was not&#xD;
known, and Wall Street keeps its secrets&#xD;
well. The world wondered for a day or&#xD;
two; somebody seized the books, too,&#xD;
when it was known that the man was gone&#xD;
for good and all; but there were no "devel-&#xD;
opments," and in that mart of gold what is&#xD;
man that he should be remembered?&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
A ROSE IS CRUSHED.&#xD;
WITH the connivance of Stephen, Char-&#xD;
Icy made his way unobserved in the even-&#xD;
ing to the library of the house in the Avenue,&#xD;
where his father sat alone over the night's&#xD;
journals. The old servitor had said that&#xD;
Mr. Wales was not so strong as he had&#xD;
been; but it was not yet known to Chancy&#xD;
that some months before the banker had&#xD;
been prostrated with severe and danger-&#xD;
ous illness. I had omitted to speag of it to&#xD;
him, supposing, indeed, that he must have&#xD;
known it; but, as the reader is aware, he&#xD;
did not, and was consequently unprepared&#xD;
for the great change in his father's appear-&#xD;
ance.&#xD;
Time and incessant toil had broken the&#xD;
man of iron at last; it was the first actual&#xD;
sickness of his life, and brought with it the&#xD;
first realizing sense that Nature, tried and&#xD;
disdained, l)rooks no plea of" business" nor&#xD;
yields to any force of will in the execution&#xD;
of her laws and the infliction of her punish-&#xD;
ments. She had been kind, cruelly kind,&#xD;
&#xD;
to him, and borne the long subordination&#xD;
ivell; hut wheii the avenging stroke fell it&#xD;
was merciless an(l terrible, and he rallied&#xD;
fi-om it only to find weakiWss and weariness&#xD;
in the place of his former strength, -a strong&#xD;
shackle on hip and limb never again to be&#xD;
loosened. He was compelled to modify his&#xD;
habits, but he resented savagely the advice&#xD;
of his physician to retire from active busi-&#xD;
ness. lie would cling to the last to some&#xD;
mimicry of the 01(1 life, and in his bitterness&#xD;
struggle to the very end against the convic-&#xD;
tion of powers impaired and duties defied.&#xD;
It is an every-day picture of the working-&#xD;
day world, this soulless slavery of age, this&#xD;
cnin~ino bondaoe of the to the&#xD;
graybeard&#xD;
idols of his prime. His all is this little&#xD;
concomitant of existence "stamped in&#xD;
gold." Life has no other meaning for him:&#xD;
what to him must be the meaning of&#xD;
death?&#xD;
It may be that other and different feelings&#xD;
came to the banker with the sense of weak-&#xD;
ness and the dread realization of physical&#xD;
decay, awakening the cravings of age and&#xD;
rendering the old chosen isolation oppres-&#xD;
sive. Certain it is that he welcomed the&#xD;
return of his niece with marked plefisure,&#xD;
an~l Emma's pain in finding him so broken&#xD;
was mitigated by gratification at his unusual&#xD;
display of feeling.&#xD;
Charley was shocked and saddened by the&#xD;
striking change that had come upon his f~-&#xD;
thor. lIe advanced with a faltering heart,&#xD;
as Stephen withdrew, closing the door soft-&#xD;
ly behind him; and Mr. Wales's face assumed&#xD;
a puzzled and rather dissatisfiedd expression&#xD;
as the young man paused by his chair with&#xD;
his hat in his hand. The father failed to&#xD;
recognize his son.&#xD;
"You do not know me, father: it is&#xD;
Chancy," said the loor boy; and it re-&#xD;
quired a strong effort to nerve the trem-&#xD;
bling lips even for those few words. He&#xD;
had studied, too, what he was to say, but&#xD;
now when the time for utterance had come&#xD;
the words failed hiiAt&#xD;
The banker started, and seemed about to&#xD;
rise, but he did not do so, nor did he give&#xD;
his hand to his son. After one sharp, rec-&#xD;
ognizing look at Chancy's face, he withdrew&#xD;
his eyes and fixed them on Macancy; he&#xD;
was evidently trying to mould his features&#xD;
into the old rigid lines. It was not alto-&#xD;
gether a surprise; he had reasoned, as he&#xD;
thought, infallible, that just such an event&#xD;
would occur sooner or later, just such a re-&#xD;
turn of the prodigal when the last resource&#xD;
had been exhausted, and the wayward spir-&#xD;
it humbled with suffering and want. He&#xD;
had made the contingency a study at times,&#xD;
more frequently of late, and, crushing&#xD;
some faint impulses which stirred his heart,&#xD;
had resolved to be just in his actions above&#xD;
all questions of affection; and leniency had&#xD;
&#xD;
no conspicuous place in Mr. Wales's ideas of&#xD;
justice. He intended so to act now, though&#xD;
for an instant he had been stas-tled into softer&#xD;
feelings by Chancy's appearance; he had&#xD;
not reckoned on so early a denouement. He&#xD;
remained quite silent, collecting huis thoughts,&#xD;
and Charley got a little self-possession in&#xD;
the pause.&#xD;
"I am sorry, father, if my presence is un-&#xD;
welcome to you. I did not come on my-&#xD;
own account, - at least not entirely; I had&#xD;
no longer any right to do that, as 1 am fully&#xD;
aware. I cannot explain things in any way&#xD;
so well as this paper will do it, and you&#xD;
would rather read it than hear my words,&#xD;
perhaps; will you look at it, please?"&#xD;
Charley produced and extcnde'l to his&#xD;
father the confession of Richard Huntley.&#xD;
The hanker had looked up rather curiously,&#xD;
and received it mechanically from his hands.&#xD;
He was not pleased with this feature of the&#xD;
interview; he believed it to be some small&#xD;
piece of charlatanry, and it was very bitter&#xD;
for him to think his son had descended to&#xD;
~such a method of gaining favor. Without&#xD;
opening the paper, he asked, coldly, "What&#xD;
is this?"&#xD;
"It is the witnessed acknowledgment of&#xD;
a villain who has deceived and injured all&#xD;
of mms, father. I hope it will not pain you too&#xD;
greatly: the man is Richard Huntley."&#xD;
It was a little strange that conviction of&#xD;
their truth went straight to the banker's&#xD;
heart with these words; he had never&#xD;
formed any defined suspicion of Iluntley,&#xD;
but his earliest judgment of the man had&#xD;
never changed, and it had never been&#xD;
wholly favorable to him. In his business&#xD;
connections with Wales, Burton, &amp;amp; Co., Mr.&#xD;
Huntley never found himself in a position&#xD;
of entirely unguarded trust; he had noted&#xD;
the fact often enough, but ascribed it read-&#xD;
ily to the well-known cautious policy of the&#xD;
house. Mr. Wales accepted human nature&#xD;
en masse with reservations; lie accepted&#xD;
Huntley with an additional allowance, for&#xD;
which ~there is no ready word of description.&#xD;
There was not a shadow of feeling in the&#xD;
banker's face, however, as he proceeded de-&#xD;
liberately to open the document. He said&#xD;
simply, "I trust you do not make such&#xD;
an extraordinary statement unadvisedly."&#xD;
Charley remained standing, and watched&#xD;
his father with a beating heart, as he read&#xD;
down the sheet. Mr. Wales first glanced&#xD;
at the signatures, and then passed slowly&#xD;
and carefully over the first allegation, read-&#xD;
ing it twice, but with a still implacable face.&#xD;
He looked up after it, however, and said&#xD;
quietly, "Won't you sit down?"&#xD;
The young man murmured," Thank you,"&#xD;
and sat down humbly enough. After the&#xD;
second clause the banker wrinkled his brows,&#xD;
and Charley, watching him covertly, was&#xD;
glad to see some evidence of feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7944-00000064"/>&#xD;
126                        CIIOISY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You know this to he true?" he asked&#xD;
sharply; he did not specify the charge, but&#xD;
Charley had followed his eyes down the&#xD;
page, and knew which he meant.&#xD;
"I lived more than a month in his wife's&#xD;
house in England," he replied.&#xD;
"You might have been deceived."&#xD;
"You forget, father: he confesses the&#xD;
charge~ Even if he had not, it could be&#xD;
proved beyond question."&#xD;
Mr. Wales moved uneasily in his chair&#xD;
and looked up quickly as he read the last&#xD;
charge. "He tried to take your life?"&#xD;
"It was partly my fault. I labored hard&#xD;
to avoi(l him on the ship, but he recognized&#xD;
me finally. We had some words and I - I&#xD;
struck him; he threw me over the ship's&#xD;
side, and I was saved by the merest chance."&#xD;
The banker drew a long, painful breath,&#xD;
and remained silent and thoughtful for&#xD;
some moments.&#xD;
"What have you done?" he asked.&#xD;
"There seemed to be only one thing to&#xD;
do and avoid publicity. We got him to&#xD;
sign the paper, and he is to leave the coun-&#xD;
try immediately." Afterwards, at his fa-&#xD;
ther's request, Charley described more mi-&#xD;
nutely the struggle on the ship and the in-&#xD;
terview at my office; at the end he said,&#xD;
"This will be very painful for my cousin;&#xD;
would it not be best to engage Mrs. Jen-&#xD;
nings to tell her?~'&#xD;
"Yes; I think so," replied Mr. Wales.&#xD;
There was silence after this, and some-&#xD;
thing like perplexity in the banker's mind,&#xD;
occasioned by the unexpected developments.&#xD;
Gentler impulses were struggling for pre-&#xD;
dominance, but the old man's stubborn preju.&#xD;
dice died hard.&#xD;
"Where are you staying?" he asked at&#xD;
last, and rather abruptly.&#xD;
"With Mr. Meegs at his rooms for the&#xD;
present."&#xD;
"Have you any plans?"&#xD;
Charley could not determine whether the&#xD;
tone was kindly or not, but he bore up&#xD;
bravely.&#xD;
"I have no settled plans," he said; "this&#xD;
matter has completely absorbed my thoughts.&#xD;
I had an idea, however, of going West and&#xD;
finding something to do. I have still some-&#xD;
thing left," he added with a flushed face,&#xD;
"and I might make my way there in some&#xD;
business."&#xD;
"It is not a bad project," said his father,&#xD;
more kindly; "the best, perhaps. Mean-&#xD;
time you had better come home."&#xD;
Charley's heart was in his throat at the&#xD;
words. Before he could speak Mr. Wales&#xD;
asked, "You will see Mrs. Jennings?"&#xD;
"Yes, at once; to-night, if I am not too&#xD;
late."&#xD;
" It would be as well, certainly."&#xD;
Charley got u~ to go, and his father rose&#xD;
at the same time, but in an absent way.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chanley was obliged to ask hhn for the pa-&#xD;
per, which he retained in his hand.&#xD;
"I ought to show it to Mrs. Jennings, or,&#xD;
at least, be provide with it, that I may do&#xD;
so, if necessary. I shall not see you again&#xD;
sir, to-night. You said- you think I should&#xD;
come home?"&#xD;
"Of course; there will be time enough&#xD;
to arrange your plans afterwards."&#xD;
"Then I will come to-morrow and be&#xD;
very happy to do so. I thank you for the&#xD;
privilege, father. Good night!"&#xD;
He put out his hand tiiaidly; but Mr.&#xD;
Wales took it and held it a moment, while&#xD;
he looked at the young man fully for the&#xD;
first time and noted his thin face.&#xD;
"Good night, my son," he said soberly,&#xD;
yet kindly; "you have found experience a&#xD;
hard teacher, have you not?"&#xD;
"I have indeed, sir; I hope the lesson&#xD;
will be a useful one."&#xD;
"I trust it may. Good night. I shall&#xD;
not mention to your cousin that you are&#xD;
here."&#xD;
Charley went out as he had come in, see-&#xD;
ing no one but Stephen; but a light hand&#xD;
was running softly and rather sadly over&#xD;
the piano keys, as he passed the parlor&#xD;
doors, and his heart bounded at the sounds.&#xD;
"You are coming back, Mr. Charles?"&#xD;
asked the servant anxiously at the door.&#xD;
"To-morrow, Stephen, to-morrow, you&#xD;
good old soul!"&#xD;
His heart was in the skies as he ran&#xD;
across the street. There was a blaze of&#xD;
light and a rattle of merry voices in the&#xD;
drawing-rooms, hut he hardly noticed them&#xD;
particularly.&#xD;
"Will you tell Mrs. Jennings that an old&#xD;
friend wishes to see her in private for five&#xD;
minutes?" he said to a bewildered domes-&#xD;
tic, who subsequently declared that "his&#xD;
voice struck her all of a heap, ~t did, but&#xD;
she 'd never 'a' known it was Mr. Charles."&#xD;
Mrs. Jennings, coming lato the library,&#xD;
was unspeakably astonished and a little dis-&#xD;
mayed to see the singer of the ship standing&#xD;
therein, and could not restrain a momentary&#xD;
impulse to call back the servant. Charley's&#xD;
quick words checked her, "Don't be&#xD;
alarmed, Mamma Jennings; it 's only poor&#xD;
me, - Charley Wales!"&#xD;
"Bless my soul! you poor boy!" lit was&#xD;
all she could say. Tears were in her eyes&#xD;
and in her throat, and only a woman's over-&#xD;
flowing pity in her heart sweeping away all&#xD;
other thoughts. She ivent up to him and&#xD;
took the bearded face into her two hands to&#xD;
see it better, and the smiling eyes reassured&#xD;
her. She kissed him lightly on the brow, and&#xD;
then gave way to a little burst of tears that&#xD;
prevented all speech for the moment.&#xD;
Charley made her sit down.&#xD;
"1 bring you a very painful revelation,&#xD;
but it must be made without delay. We&#xD;
&#xD;
A ROSE IS CRUSHED.                 127&#xD;
&#xD;
have all been terribly deceived, mam-&#xD;
ma!"&#xD;
Mrs. Jennings's emotions on hearing of&#xD;
Huutley's duplicity (for Chancy told her&#xD;
but half) all touk the form of sympathy for&#xD;
Emma.&#xD;
"The poor child! what an escape for&#xD;
her! It will be very bitter for her, though&#xD;
I'm not sure- lain glad you are hereglad&#xD;
you are the deliverer. You have been a&#xD;
great scamp, Mr. Charles! Of course you&#xD;
have seen your father."&#xD;
"He was very good to me; I am going&#xD;
back home to-morrow."&#xD;
~' You haven't seen Emma, then?"&#xD;
"No, I must not; I do not want to see&#xD;
her until she knows all."&#xD;
"To be sure, Mr. Wisdom! And that&#xD;
was you all the time on the steamer? How&#xD;
strange it is! The wretch is going; we&#xD;
shall not have to see him again?"&#xD;
"Never, I trust."&#xD;
"I can't realize it! It 'sjust like a dream,&#xD;
and I sha' n't sleep a wink after it. Poor&#xD;
Em! she must know it at once!" 1&#xD;
"You will tell her gently; do you think&#xD;
she - she will find it very hard?"&#xD;
The wise woman smiled wickedly at him,&#xD;
despite her perplexity.&#xD;
"I can't tell, I hope not; only, you must -&#xD;
There! let me think about it."&#xD;
"I leave it all to you; only I must go&#xD;
home to-morrow, and I want to see my&#xD;
cousin," said he, plaintively.&#xD;
"So he shall," laughed the lady, "though&#xD;
he does n't half deserve it. I ought not to&#xD;
say that, however, since you have saved her a&#xD;
from what I can't bear to think of. You I&#xD;
are lucky to have so well atoned, sir! -&#xD;
There, I 'm talking nonsense. I 'II see Em- a&#xD;
ma in the morning;* I must think about it." a&#xD;
"You won't say anything about the ship c&#xD;
singer?" said Charley, rising, and with ill-&#xD;
diso-ulsed anxiety. d&#xD;
'~'1t does n't seem necessary; but she d&#xD;
must know you are here." U&#xD;
"I think not; father will not tell her yet, h&#xD;
and Stephen is bound with oaths. Don't tell e&#xD;
her, please."&#xD;
"Ah, I see! Well, I won't, though I V&#xD;
may tell her who found the villain out." c&#xD;
"If you like; it won't m~tter. I shall e&#xD;
see her in the afternoon. I will go now.&#xD;
Good night."                           U&#xD;
Half-way to the door he turned to her u&#xD;
again and fixed a hungry, beseeching look ~i&#xD;
on her face.                           n&#xD;
"Mamma Jennings, you know! Will you&#xD;
tell me something?"&#xD;
"That depends, young man!"           V&#xD;
"Does Emma - Has she love&#xD;
much?."                      dkimvery n&#xD;
The temptation to punish him was strong, n~&#xD;
but there was n~ resisting the appeal of h&#xD;
that young face! -&#xD;
&#xD;
"Emma never loved any one but a naughty&#xD;
fellow who did n't deserve&#xD;
The sentence did not reach a conclusion.&#xD;
The two lithe arms went around the mam-&#xD;
ma's neck, and a profusion of whiskers&#xD;
obstructed speech and vision for a moment;&#xD;
and in the next the gentleman-passenger of&#xD;
the steerage went out with flying coat-tails&#xD;
at the door.&#xD;
"How happy they will be!" said the&#xD;
good woman, exultantly; "and to think&#xD;
of that wretch! He did send the paper,&#xD;
after all! You are only a blind old woman,&#xD;
Susan Jennings!"&#xD;
The "mamma" went unannounced, next&#xD;
morning, to Emma's own room, and caught&#xD;
that young woman dreaming over some&#xD;
written papers that she hid hastily as her&#xD;
visitor entered. Mrs. Jennings did not&#xD;
fail to notice the troubled face, upon which&#xD;
something of the old look of suffering had&#xD;
come back; but it gave her no great pain&#xD;
or uneasiness now. She felt tolerably sure&#xD;
of the case; her quick perception told her&#xD;
that the old love had struggled into power&#xD;
again among the old associations, and she&#xD;
guessedd shrewdly at the condition of feeling&#xD;
[n which Emma had fallen; hut she guessed&#xD;
niy half of the truth.&#xD;
"I came to look after you, you truant!"&#xD;
die cried, gayly; "here are two evenings&#xD;
lone, and we have not had a glimpse of you.&#xD;
~ll the world has been calling, or 1 should&#xD;
mve come sooner."&#xD;
"I know," said Emma, embarrassed. "I&#xD;
vas expecting Mr. Huntley all the time,&#xD;
md could not go out. He has not been&#xD;
here at all since we arrived. I don't know&#xD;
- I suppose we ought to send and inquire&#xD;
~bout him; had we not? I asked uncle last&#xD;
might, but he did not seem to think it ne-&#xD;
essary. Yet he may be ill."&#xD;
"Your nncle is generally right, dear;&#xD;
Lon't fret about it. Come here and sit&#xD;
[own by me; there, like that. It's a long&#xD;
~me, ls n't it, since you and the old lady&#xD;
ave had a good, old-fashioned chat togeth-&#xD;
Emma had come rather wearily yet gladly&#xD;
o the old place by the mamma's knee, and&#xD;
crouched there silently, not meeting her&#xD;
yes. Her faoe was hidden from Mrs.&#xD;
innings; but could that lady have seen it,&#xD;

When Emma grew calmer her friend told twenty times she came up to "Sultan" in&#xD;
her careftdly and tenderly the whole story, his gilded cage, and watched him with un-&#xD;
all that she herself knew; how this man, responsive eyes as he heat his wings against&#xD;

"Tut! let me go! I won't answer any trusting look of a woman who gives all&#xD;

I did, from the very first moment on the&#xD;

"And you gave no sign!"&#xD;
"Did I not? I was so unhappy! 0&#xD;
Charley! I can't bear to think of it; but&#xD;
I trusted you!"&#xD;
He gathered her closer with hi~ strong&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
"And loved me a little?" he asked.&#xD;
"I have always loved you, when you did&#xD;
not know it; ever since I can remember!"&#xD;
There could be but one answer to that,&#xD;
and he gave it; hut one way to repeat the&#xD;
avowal without words, and that she adopted.&#xD;
Then they sat down like two people in a&#xD;
dream; and old Stephen, who, after a peep&#xD;
at them, had kept the gate like Horatius&#xD;
of old all this time against a discouraged&#xD;
domestic bearing a huge tray of steaming&#xD;
dishes, now let that functionary pass, and&#xD;
walked away to the vestibule, where he&#xD;
blew his nose excitedly, with much ditl'usion&#xD;
of bandanna, and made a haIfa dozen absurd&#xD;
and unnecessary rearrangements of the&#xD;
door-mat.&#xD;
How beautiful she was to Charley's hungry&#xD;
eyes, as she busied herself at the little ta-&#xD;
ble, and made a parade of ministering to&#xD;
his wants who wanted nothing! How&#xD;
lovely the old-new face, now timid and&#xD;
blushing under his relentless eyes, now bold&#xD;
with love's boldness, and meeting his gaze&#xD;
with the conscious joy that comes but once&#xD;
in life!&#xD;
How noble and wonderful he was! No&#xD;
one was ever half so good, so heroic, so&#xD;
tender, so brave, so admirable as he!&#xD;
And what a love was theirs! Surely&#xD;
no two had ever so loved before.&#xD;
The poor, crushed rose! she took it ten-&#xD;
deny from her dress and gave it to him,&#xD;
when he begged for it, and seemed to want&#xD;
as well the hand that gave it; but it had 1&#xD;
come between their hearts, and been pressed -&#xD;
out of all semblance of a rose~&#xD;
sweet, strong odor made it beautiful still, I&#xD;
and in its martyrdom it had been sanctified.&#xD;
Happy the paths of those who have found I&#xD;
a crushed rose somewhere ~n the weary&#xD;
way!&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
WON AND LOST.&#xD;
S&#xD;
CHARLEY did not "go out West." Those s&#xD;
far-away, industrious votnmunities, whose s&#xD;
names seem the synonyms of enterprise and&#xD;
success, will never rejoice in the accession&#xD;
to their population of that reconstructed t&#xD;
and thoroughly estimable young man. For s&#xD;
him the problem of the future was resolved 'J&#xD;
in a glow of love's sunshine and by love's n&#xD;
spirit hands in that morning hour whose c&#xD;
17&#xD;

~D LOST.                           129&#xD;
events we have just described. Not that he,&#xD;
as my impulsive reader, being also young in&#xD;
heart, if not in years, may have imagined,&#xD;
not that he and his true "ladye-love" were&#xD;
forthwith launched in a painted boat upon&#xD;
a painted sea, and amid the dazzling and&#xD;
sulphuric surroundings of a modern "trans-&#xD;
formation scene" wafted by scented breezes&#xD;
to some swbet, secluded, and mysterious&#xD;
hourne, following in the wake of Monte&#xD;
Cristo and the princess to slow music and&#xD;
an invisible chorus. The advantages of a&#xD;
scenic denouement of that kind are unde-&#xD;
niably very great, and to none more patent&#xD;
than the writer, - than to writers in gen-&#xD;
eral, I fancy, who must ever endure the&#xD;
pain of having the fbw last moments of&#xD;
their little comedies made chaotic by a&#xD;
rising audience and a shuffle of impa-&#xD;
tient feet towards the door. There is,&#xD;
indeed~ something enlivening in the smoky&#xD;
ending of a romance that sends the two&#xD;
happy ones away under full canvas to find&#xD;
and people Avalon; the process perpetuates&#xD;
theis felicity, and they escape the rude&#xD;
after-touch of the vulgar practical by disap-&#xD;
pearing at once and forever from our eyes;&#xD;
beside such an attractive and inspiring con-&#xD;
clusion the trite old addendum that "they&#xD;
were married and lived happily ever after-&#xD;
wards" becomes positively coarse~, and&#xD;
retains no quality to recommend it beyond&#xD;
great convenience to the scribe. I confess&#xD;
a leaning to the poetical climax. 1 like&#xD;
the somewhat hackneyed, but ever-alluring&#xD;
idea of seclusion from the world, and the&#xD;
shared solitude of Byron's dream. I toss&#xD;
my hat to About's gallant Marquis, and&#xD;
his exquisite picture of a far island in a&#xD;
military sea, "upon that isle a single palm-&#xD;
tree with you (Ia liien aime'c) at its foot, and&#xD;
at your feet myself!"&#xD;
But it is .ju~t pos4ble that to our Charley&#xD;
the simple earthlyy - nay, vulgar, if you will&#xD;
- culmination was so entirely satisfactory as&#xD;
;o leave no room for an unspoken desire. His&#xD;
irst step was to make Emma promise to&#xD;
narry him in three months' time, a compact&#xD;
:o which she subscribed with commendable&#xD;
resignation . Then he did what all the&#xD;
doctors had not been able to do, he got his&#xD;
ather away from Wall Street, and forth-&#xD;
rith transported the household down to a&#xD;
luiet corner of the New England beach,&#xD;
vhere they were joined by Mrs. Jennings&#xD;
md her family, and where the summer days&#xD;
ped to such joyous measures that even the&#xD;
low blood of the worn-out banker warmed&#xD;
uto neal~ life.&#xD;
I was permitted the happiness of joining&#xD;
he circle, and shared, for a brief season,&#xD;
something of the gladness that animated it.&#xD;
throughh my life I shall carry the pleasant&#xD;
memory of that time, - of Charley and his&#xD;
constant kindness; of Miss lowland, whom&#xD;

&#xD;
to know was to worship with almost re-&#xD;
ligious reverence ; of Clare, whose untamed&#xD;
soul had caught a serious, perhaps a wistful,&#xD;
shade from the spectacle of Emma's crowned&#xD;
life ; and of Mrs. Jennings, who had lost a&#xD;
little of her absolutism, and was the embodi-&#xD;
ment of motherly sweetness to the happy&#xD;
trio, to all of whom she was the loved&#xD;
" mamma."&#xD;
Before they came back to town I had&#xD;
gone to other skies. I had promised to&#xD;
" stand up " with Charley ; but before the&#xD;
day came round fate and a doctor had in-&#xD;
tervened, and the ocean rolled between us.&#xD;
The years go on, and more than one has&#xD;
dropped to the rear since .that day of mar-&#xD;
riage bells. Messages come to me in far-&#xD;
away corners, and grow .old in the transit ;&#xD;
but they tell me all is well with Charley in&#xD;
the new life. His father, I hear, has practi-&#xD;
cally withdrawn from the street, and the&#xD;
young man gives a certain guidance to the&#xD;
affairs of the great office in his place ; but I&#xD;
have been informed that the old name will&#xD;
soon disappear altogether from its ancient&#xD;
niche, and be known no more in the active&#xD;
mart. Meantime a river-side nest has sprung&#xD;
up among the cedars, where, years ago,&#xD;
three laughing children chased butterflies&#xD;
and filled the shady hollows with the echoes&#xD;
of their simple nursery songs. It is hal-&#xD;
lowed ground now. Of those young voices&#xD;
some are silent, and will sing no more on&#xD;
earth ; but the memory is sweet to Charley&#xD;
Wales and his beautiful wife, who are dwell-&#xD;
ing there among the treasured scenes, hav-&#xD;
ing realized the hope of their lives after&#xD;
many perils and grievous pains.&#xD;
I was standing alone, only the other day,&#xD;
at a corner of the grand Promenade at&#xD;
Nice. A few people moved lazily along the&#xD;
walk, and a thin line of vehicles clattered&#xD;
by me in the roadway. The wonderful&#xD;
trottoir of other days, which for animation&#xD;
and display in the winter time was without&#xD;
a rival in Europe, was now a desolate shad-&#xD;
ow of itself, and shrouded in a gloom which&#xD;
needed not the presence of maimed men in&#xD;
uniform and sad-faced women begging aid&#xD;
in the name of the Geneva Cross to&#xD;
heighten its sombreness. From the long&#xD;
line of noble villas all signs of life had fled.&#xD;
The great Casino gates were closed and&#xD;
locked, and a subscription-box hung thereon&#xD;
with the ever-present appeal of Secours aux&#xD;
Blessed's staring at the passer-by.&#xD;
Standing thus and gazing idly down at&#xD;
the rock-strewn beach, where the low-voiced&#xD;
Mediterranean waves followed out each&#xD;
other in tranquil succession and broke&#xD;
without sound upon the stones, I had lost&#xD;
myself in a vague, dreamy meditation which&#xD;
drifted away into seaside fancies of a thou-&#xD;
sand things, -mostly sad they were. I had&#xD;
&#xD;
been wondering, indeed, if there might not&#xD;
be a thread of meaniing in that eternal and&#xD;
unending wave-song at my feet, if in the&#xD;
soft swash of those wonderful azure waters,&#xD;
over which fair Helen of old fled to luckless&#xD;
Troy, and on whose " sounding shore "&#xD;
blind Homer sang, there was not some un-.&#xD;
known measure. of words, which, if we&#xD;
could but interpret them, would tell us such&#xD;
tales of wonder of the ages dead and gone&#xD;
and the great souls who faded with them,&#xD;
as would shame the poor lives and the&#xD;
feeble deeds of to-day.&#xD;
And still as I stood and dreamed two shat-&#xD;
tered relics of my race came and sat on a&#xD;
bench near by: one, a soldier of the line, in&#xD;
soiled red pants and a tattered great-coat&#xD;
of blue ; the other, a Garibaldian, in a&#xD;
crimson shirt and cap and enormous jack-&#xD;
boots.&#xD;
" I lost my arm at Dijon, comrade," said&#xD;
the last; "and you -?"&#xD;
"I was shot down at Villejuif, under the&#xD;
walls of Paris."&#xD;
Paris ? The name had lost its meaning;&#xD;
from the soldier's lips it fell like that of a&#xD;
buried- thing whom yesterday we called&#xD;
man and friend, and who to-day is dust.&#xD;
There is no longer a Paris. A hideous,&#xD;
spectre decked in cheap tinsel, a painted*&#xD;
and bedizened thing, will flaunt itself to-&#xD;
morrow before the world, and borrow the&#xD;
old name to conceal the fraud. But no one&#xD;
will be deceived, and all will turn away&#xD;
weary and sick at heart to see the Moenad&#xD;
revel where ruled the queen. La reine est&#xD;
morte, and there is no succession.&#xD;
People are coming and going in the walk,&#xD;
and a murmur that flies swiftly among them&#xD;
reaches me and disturbs my fancies. I turn&#xD;
with indolent curiosity and follow the direc-&#xD;
tion of the general gaze. Down the broad&#xD;
avenue a pony-phaeton moves rapidly, driv-&#xD;
en by a lady who sits alone, - the groom in&#xD;
his perch behind can hardly be called a&#xD;
companion, - and I am able only to catch a&#xD;
glimpse of her face, as the fairy equipage&#xD;
flashes past. But its cold yet marvellous&#xD;
beauty thrills me:I with a strange feeling,&#xD;
while more than one voice in that outspoken&#xD;
throngr comes to my ear, "How lovely she&#xD;
is still'!"&#xD;
It is not strange to me, that clear mixed&#xD;
profile, with the smouldering gray eyes and&#xD;
the pallid but rounded cheeks. 1 saw it first&#xD;
amid the strange surroundings of the great&#xD;
rouge-et-noir table at Monaco, and had gazed&#xD;
with wonder at that magnificent but icy&#xD;
framework of a soul. She was playing, -&#xD;
playing with a listless, contemptuous hand&#xD;
that tossed thousands upon the cloth with an&#xD;
air of utter indifference, and a face that gave&#xD;
nio token, only that in its very immobility&#xD;
one might read the epitaph of feeling.&#xD;
While 1 watched it the cold, careless eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
fell upon me and lingered for an instant -&#xD;
with something like a flash in their clear&#xD;
depths. I felt myself flush and tremble&#xD;
under the scrutiny, and looked away in boy-&#xD;
ish confusion. When I turned again she&#xD;
was idly following the dealer's cards, and I&#xD;
saw her eyes no more. They told me, when&#xD;
I asked, that she was Nina Choisy, and at&#xD;
the C6rcle the brave gentlemen shrugged&#xD;
their shoulders at the name, and looked at&#xD;
me a little angrily I thought.&#xD;
More than the name they could tell me&#xD;
nothing. The woman moved in their world&#xD;
still, but moved apart. Not that she was&#xD;
unapproachable, but a certain indefinable&#xD;
renown had attached itself to her name. The&#xD;
few who had sought favor at her hands came&#xD;
back discomfited, and, warned by the ex-&#xD;
ample, men withdrew, and ventured no more&#xD;
