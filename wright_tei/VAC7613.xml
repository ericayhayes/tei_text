" My name is Houston, sir."&#xD;
"   ;A name already well known to fame ; but.&#xD;
there are those 'who affirm that you are opposed&#xD;
to prosecuting an energetic war, such as the&#xD;
I-esent cisis requires." I&#xD;
"Let those who assert'tlat I am opposed to&#xD;
decisive measures, shoulder their guns:'and fol-&#xD;
low me; and he who'is the 'first to, turn back,&#xD;
let, posterity brand him a coward, and a traitor,&#xD;
to his country."&#xD;
"I pel dve not all the tales I have l heard&#xD;
That youlare a brave man, his been proved to&#xD;
the world. I shall keep myself advised of your&#xD;
movements as much as possible, and when there&#xD;
is fighting to be done, I shall be near you to&#xD;
take part in it."'&#xD;
" Your bold bearing, your free speech, your&#xD;
soiled and blood-stained garments all assure me'&#xD;
that you can fight. May I ask the name of one&#xD;
who' braves death so fearlessly'?"&#xD;
"My name can be of little 'consequence to&#xD;
you, but it were uncourteous not to give a fitting&#xD;
answer.  I am  called Ethington ; but I care&#xD;
not to besnown, or would be known only by&#xD;
my deeds."&#xD;
" Brave men should not give place to mis-&#xD;
anthropy, because, forsooth, the lady of their&#xD;
love has proved fickle or unkind. Away with&#xD;
melancholy, sir, for fortune seldom forsakes one&#xD;
not to return again."&#xD;
"The advice is frankly given and well meant ;&#xD;
but I regret to say that upon one like me, it is&#xD;
thrown away. I hope, in return, that you will&#xD;
never live to'tarnish the fame which you have&#xD;
won, and that you may finish the bright career&#xD;
before you with honor unsullied by a single act'&#xD;
of cowardice or indiscretion."&#xD;
"The word cowardice is offensive, sir. What-&#xD;
ever changes time may produce, it will fail to&#xD;
make me a coward," said the general, contract-&#xD;
ing his' brows.  " You shall have war, and war&#xD;
to the knife.  I say it-Sam Houston says it-&#xD;
and no man can say these lips ever uttered a&#xD;
falsehood."*&#xD;
" Texas looks 'to you for aid in this trying&#xD;

The parties rode on in silence for some dis.&#xD;
tance. The sound of water was at length heard&#xD;
and they soon reached the Colorado, whose banks&#xD;
were fringed with broad woodlands, broken into&#xD;
bold bluffs, or covered with grass, bordering&#xD;
upon prairies and affording pasturage, where the&#xD;
wild mustang, the deer and the buffalo were&#xD;
often seen.&#xD;
The horses were turned loose, and Ethington&#xD;
and his servant took peaceable possession of a&#xD;
small cabin near the river, which had evidently.&#xD;
been occupied by some person qfiite recently.&#xD;
Felix kindled a fire, and Ethington took his&#xD;
rifle and went in quest of game, for neither had&#xD;
tasted food since the previous day.&#xD;

I-&#xD;

'4'&#xD;
&#xD;
determined never to return, but to unite hi&#xD;
fortunes to the Texan patriots who were stra&#xD;
gling for their liberties, and die like a brav&#xD;
man fighting to the last.&#xD;
The cup of his short-lived happiness was dash&#xD;
ed to the earth, and he desired to 'live no long&#xD;
er. His negro servant refused to ,desert' hin&#xD;
and had shared all the dangers' of his reckless&#xD;
career since entering Texas. He had been I&#xD;
many engagements, fought- boldly, and exposed&#xD;
himself rashly to the enemy ; but strange to rd&#xD;
late, had, miraculously as it would almost seeri&#xD;
escaped death; and to crown all had passed&#xD;
through the terrible tragedy of the Alant ,&#xD;
scathed, while over one hundred and eighty me&#xD;
had fallen.&#xD;
Walter Ethington was about; twenty-foW&#xD;
years of age, and had been pronounced "ban&#xD;
some " by the ladies, who are competentjudg&#xD;
in such matters, as every man of gallantry"'&#xD;
allow. In filgure he was rather above the e&#xD;
dium size, straight as an arrow, firm  and mar&#xD;
pendent in his bearing. 'lHe was 'bz'avelin b&#xD;

.&#xD;
&#xD;
T will be understood by the perusal of the&#xD;
foregoing chapter, that our hero had met&#xD;
with some severe disappointment in matters per-&#xD;
taining to the heart, which had driven him from&#xD;
his home and friends, and made him a reckless&#xD;
wanderer in the wilds of Texas.&#xD;
The particular circumstances which had led to&#xD;
these results shall be made known to the read-&#xD;
er in due time. It is enough for'the present&#xD;
purpose to say that he had been deeply enamor-&#xD;
ed with a young lady, by the name of Andrea&#xD;
St. Aubert, and for a brief period had firmly&#xD;
believed that his passion was reciprocated.&#xD;
Miss St.. Aubert was endowed with rare&#xD;
beauty of person, and those excellent gifts of&#xD;
the mind which are calculated to charm and&#xD;
dazzle those within the sphere of its influence.&#xD;
Walter Ethington was at length, as he believed,&#xD;
undeceived in relation to the object of his idol-&#xD;
atry (for his love fell little short of adoration).&#xD;
He obtained such proofs of her inconstancy that&#xD;
he felt all was at an end between them. Ad-&#xD;
dressing her a hasty note, full of reproaches for&#xD;
her perfidy, he left Louisiana, his native State,&#xD;

, occasionally interspersed with the ash&#xD;
sycamore, pausing atitervals to watch the&#xD;
ters-hurrying on to be discharged into the&#xD;
if of Mexico. Emerging from the wood after&#xD;
an hour's walk, he stood on the border of a&#xD;
all, rolling prairie, green with. grass and&#xD;
bbery. At that moment he saw a deer&#xD;
etly browsing at the distance of about three&#xD;
dred yards.  Ethington was a good marks-&#xD;

Agai $   ee  but I regret to see you&#xD;
&#xD;
have not profited by my advice,'7 he said, with&#xD;
some coldness of manner.&#xD;
"I have not, neither did I intend to," re-&#xD;
plied Walter. "Why you take the liberty to&#xD;
interest yourself in my affairs, I know not ; but&#xD;
I will assure you, as I did at our first meeting,&#xD;
that I thank you not for your interference. By&#xD;
some means, Heaven knows how, you have ob-&#xD;
tained some knowledge of ny past life, and have&#xD;
presumed to make use of it under the mask of&#xD;
friendship, disinterested, and all those, fine&#xD;
things; but you are mistaken in your man. I&#xD;
know my own mind, and am pleased'to follow&#xD;
my own inclinations."&#xD;
"Headstrong boy, how long will it be ere&#xD;
you listen to the voice of reason ? Whatever&#xD;
friendship I might have professed to feel for you,&#xD;
on ghe occasion of our first meeting, was real&#xD;
and not affected, and is in nowise diminished&#xD;
to-day. What if you do not understand the&#xD;
motives which have impelled me to interest my-&#xD;
self in your welfare. Judge me as you find me,&#xD;
according to my actions, and not according to&#xD;
your own prejudice. Go back to Andrea St.&#xD;
Aubert, whom   you have basely forsaken, and&#xD;
upon your knees beg to be forgiven, and rein-&#xD;
stated in her favor."&#xD;
"Never, sir ! I have had sufficient proofs&#xD;
of her inconstancy, and to speak farther upon&#xD;
this subject will be to offer me- a personal af-&#xD;
front."&#xD;
"Were Andrea, St. Aubert, to declare with&#xD;
her own fair lips that She: had sacredly kept her&#xD;
faith to you, would you believe her, or would&#xD;
you not ?"   added  the  stranger,  somewhat&#xD;
sternly.&#xD;
" How could I believe her, sir, when I have&#xD;
the evidence of my own eyes. Leave me ; I&#xD;
tell you I will hear no more. Go and give&#xD;
your advice to yonder. beardless boy,; he will&#xD;
perhaps listen to you. When I need your&#xD;
counsel, I will seek you out and ask it boldly ;&#xD;
until then, do not forget that we are strangers."&#xD;
Walter spoke with much energy and bitter-&#xD;
ness, and when he had ceased turned his back&#xD;
towards the unknown and was walking away.&#xD;
'e QO word more before we part. You are;&#xD;

So are all men; but I have ceased to fear&#xD;
danger."&#xD;
.taut it is near-even at the door, to use a&#xD;
scriptural phrase."&#xD;
So much the better ; let it come.   Any-&#xD;
thing is better than monotony and inactivity."&#xD;
There are those who seek your life."&#xD;
"Let them take it ; for it has lost its value."&#xD;
You will not be warned ?"&#xD;
"I thank you not for this officiousness.  Per-&#xD;
haps your offers are well meant ; I know not&#xD;
and care less. . I am not in a reasonable mood,&#xD;
and have no desire to be otherwise. I have be-&#xD;
come indifferent to all the common affairs of&#xD;
life. Deceived where I trusted the most, I no&#xD;
longer lay myself liable to deception by. trusting&#xD;
again. Unloved where I loved the most ten-&#xD;
derly, I no longer bestow my love upon those&#xD;
who are no better, and but dust and ashes, like&#xD;
her and myself. , If I appear rude and ungrate-&#xD;
ful, you know why I am so, and thus have the&#xD;
reason of my ingratitude and rudeness. To&#xD;
warn me of danger is time lost, for it is what&#xD;
you term 'danger' that I seek ; and if you will&#xD;
inform me in what direction to find it, there will-&#xD;
I hasten to meet it, and feel a pleasure in doing&#xD;
80.&#xD;
"The rash boldness that has signalized yu&#xD;
in the hour of battle, has attracted the attention&#xD;
of the enemies of Texas, and a certain number&#xD;
of them under the command of one tGaroia, a&#xD;
desperate fellow, have devoted themselves to the&#xD;
task of destroying.-the 'Texan Bravo,' as you&#xD;
are styled among them," said the unknown,&#xD;
without heeding the remarks-of Ethington.&#xD;
" That'suits me well;" replied Walter, with&#xD;
a smile. "It will afford me excitement, ands&#xD;
give me an opportunity to merit the name they&#xD;
have bestowed upon me.  Let them come-the&#xD;
'Texan Bravo ' is ready ; my life shall cost&#xD;
them a dozen of their best men.   Sorrow  to&#xD;
him who comes within the range of this rifle, for&#xD;
these 'sights' never cover their object in vain.&#xD;
And' see, if they venture to close quarters, here&#xD;
are my pistols and bowie knife, ready to receive&#xD;
theym  while my arms have ' the physical power&#xD;
of eco such cowardly- fellows."&#xD;
&#xD;
"This is sheer madness," said the stranger.&#xD;
"To say more is useless. I abandon you to&#xD;
your fate."&#xD;
"Allow me to ask the name of such a disin-&#xD;
terested friend," added Ethington, somewhat&#xD;
sarcastically.&#xD;
"My name is Ridgley," replied the other;,&#xD;
then walked thoughtfully towards the boa,&#xD;
pushed it from the shore, stepped in, took&#xD;
seat in the stern, and paddled down the stream&#xD;
with the lad.&#xD;
Walter looked after them a moment, and then&#xD;
went to take possession of his game. Cutting&#xD;
the choicest portions from the deer, he placed&#xD;
them upon his shoulders, and retraced his steps&#xD;
to the cabin. Felix now performed his part,&#xD;
and very soon they were dining upon roasted&#xD;
venison, which emitted a most savory odor, es-&#xD;
pecially for the olfactories of a hungry man.&#xD;
When Ethington had satisfied the demands of&#xD;
hunger, he laid down by the blazing fire and&#xD;
slept. He was not long permitted to enjoy this&#xD;
luxury uninterrupted. lHe was aroused from'&#xD;
his dreams by Felix, who affirmed that he had&#xD;
seen a man in the vicinity' of the cabin, who ap-&#xD;
peared to reconnoitre the premises without being&#xD;
seen. This suspicious individual, he further-&#xD;
more asserted, was a Mexican, and was lurking&#xD;
about for no good.&#xD;
Ethington endeavored to assuage the fears of&#xD;
his servant, telling him that his imagination, ex-&#xD;
cited by the horrors he had recently witnessed,&#xD;
had transformed some wild .animal into a Mexi-&#xD;
can scout. But in this benevolent effort he en-&#xD;
tirely failed. Felix could by ,no means be in-&#xD;
duced to believe for a moment thV he had made&#xD;
such a mistake.&#xD;
Our hero now recalled the warning words of&#xD;
Ridgley, and resolved to watch for 4he appear-&#xD;
ance of the object of his servant's alarm. f Hav-&#xD;
ing prevailed on the latter to lie down and take&#xD;
the rest he so much needed, Walter took his&#xD;
rifle, and from the crevices on either side of the&#xD;
cabin, commenced his vigils.&#xD;
For a long time he kept his eyes fixed upon&#xD;
the surrounding woods without making a v'dis-&#xD;
coveries. This monotonous employment -soon&#xD;

&#xD;
Ire recognized the ornament at 'a glance, for&#xD;
he had in happier days given it to Andrea St.&#xD;
Aubert.  But how came it in its present situa-&#xD;
tio ?  By what magic had it been returned to&#xD;
him'? Perhaps the paper would tell. He has-&#xD;
tened to examine it, and :found only the follow-&#xD;
ing words traced in the fair hand of Andrea:&#xD;
"This chain once possessed inestimable value&#xD;
for one ; but has now lost its worth, and I res-&#xD;
tore it to the original' owner."&#xD;
This was, all the paper contained, and there&#xD;
was no signature, but the chirography could not'&#xD;
he mistaken.  As Ethington gazed at-the chain,&#xD;
the past was recalled with such vividness, that&#xD;
he found it exceedingly difficult to govern his&#xD;
emotions.  He heard once more, in imagination,&#xD;
the soft voice of Andrea, beheld her face' in its&#xD;
dazzling beauty, and, her figure in its exquisite&#xD;
grace. He shed tears as he thought of her love-&#xD;
liness both of person and mind, and grew indig-&#xD;
nant as he' remembered her inconstancy.&#xD;
"0, Andrea !" he exclaimed, "fair, but.&#xD;
false, may Heaven forgive you for the anguish&#xD;
you have caused me."&#xD;
Ethington's thoughts naturally led him to&#xD;
consider by what singular means the chain and&#xD;
note had beeh returned; but upon that interest-&#xD;
iag point he was obliged to content himself with&#xD;
mere conjecture. He finally settled down into&#xD;
the opinion which appeared the most reasonable,&#xD;
that Andrea had employed some person to re-&#xD;
store' the ornament, and 'that person had faith-&#xD;
fully performed the commission.  Walter would&#xD;
have pondered upon this subject all day, most&#xD;
probably, had not Captain Wion, the ranger,.&#xD;
who had left the cabin at sunrise, now returned&#xD;
with the' information that a scouting party of&#xD;
the 'enemy, numbering some ten or" fifteen per-&#xD;
sons, were in the neighborhood.  He had ap-&#xD;
proached the spothere they haad passed the&#xD;
night,  and" discovered  them' engaged in prepar-&#xD;
ing arid eating their morning meal.&#xD;
'If I'd had but half a dozen of the Rangers&#xD;

" Have the enemy ever ventured so far as&#xD;
here before ?", asked Ethngton.&#xD;
"Seldom or never; but they're gettin' un.&#xD;
commonly bold now. The affair of 'the lIamGo&#xD;
gives the 'tarnal critters the idea that they+e&#xD;
conquered all the country; but they'll fi4d&#xD;
themselves mistaken when they get a fair speci-&#xD;
men of Kentucky sharp-shootin',' What do you&#xD;
say to having a brush with the rascals'?"&#xD;
"Nothing could be more agreeable," replied&#xD;
Walter, "for I have reason to suppose that I&#xD;
am the object of their pursuit. I. have been&#xD;
told that some of our enemies have taken pat'&#xD;
ticular offence at my mode of fighting, and have&#xD;
sworn to accomplish my death."&#xD;
Then you are the hoss they call the Texan&#xD;
Bravo ?" rejoined the ranger, quickly.&#xD;
I believe Ilhave been thus called," answer.&#xD;
ed Walter; "but it is a title I never coveted,&#xD;
for I have not, and do not seek notoriet*  I&#xD;
wish to remain unknown, and such bae been m&#xD;
desire since I passed the boundary of my native&#xD;
State."&#xD;
" I have heard about your fightin'," said&#xD;
Wilson, "and they say there is .a great deal of&#xD;
the wild hoss in you, with a small sprinklin' of&#xD;
the Kentucky alligator and snappin' turtle."&#xD;
"Yah, yah ! heah, heah ! What a ner'&#xD;
speciment ob human natur'!" exclaimed Felix,&#xD;
displaying two rows of ivory.&#xD;
"In what way do you propose to, fight this&#xD;
scouting party, Captain Wilson ?" asked Wal-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;

a break directly for the cabin, take our bosses&#xD;

them down through the crevices as fast as:they&#xD;
show their heads."&#xD;
"The scheme pleases me ; - let us hastento&#xD;

18                 THE TEXAN BRAVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
"But first, let us see if we.can get the horses&#xD;
inside this door," added Walter.&#xD;
Upon trial, the door was found large enough&#xD;
to admit the horses without difficulty.  The two,&#xD;
then mounted, and rifle in hand rode off, the&#xD;
ranger leading the way. A ride of ten minutes&#xD;
,brought them within a few hundred yards of&#xD;
thscouting party.   Turning a little towards&#xD;
'the prairie on the right, they came suddenly in&#xD;
sight of the enemy, whp set up a great shout,&#xD;
and sprang instantly upon their mustangs, which&#xD;
wer e standing saddled and bridled near them.&#xD;
Ethington and Wilson now turned and fled, as&#xD;
iad been agreed upon, and thereupon ensued a&#xD;
siniring and scattering of the wildest and&#xD;
most exciting kind.  They put their mustangs&#xD;
8t9 their best.speed, and a dozen escopetas were&#xD;
discharged in as many seconds ; but the balls&#xD;
ell short, or whistled harmlessly by the pur-&#xD;
* uedT.&#xD;
"Hurrah for Old Kentuck !" cried the ran-&#xD;
.    and slackening his speed, brought his rifle&#xD;
Siface and fired.      A stout fellow tumbled&#xD;
from' his.seat, and the riderless mustang, not&#xD;
owingwhat else to do, kept on with the rest,&#xD;
aso&amp;amp; deing relieved of his burden, made the best&#xD;
hedeag of any.    Ethington, not wishing to be&#xD;
outdonietby the "alligator from Kentucky,"&#xD;
followed his example with equal success.&#xD;
These feats greatly enraged their pursuers.&#xD;
They yelled with redoubled energy, and urged&#xD;
nu their mustangs with new zeal; but the large,&#xD;
fine animals ridden by Walter and the captain,&#xD;
easily kept out of range of the escopetas.  In&#xD;
o±der toprolong the sport (for such they con-&#xD;
sidered it), they had diverged considerably from&#xD;
a direct course towards the cabin, and they now&#xD;
Mw, with some alarm, that several of their ene-&#xD;
nuies were making directly for the place of their&#xD;
sitreat, apparently for the purpose of cutting&#xD;
themn 6ff; which event would leave them only&#xD;
the alternative of trusting to the fleetness of&#xD;
their'horses, and throw Felix into their power.&#xD;
Both of our friends perceived the importance&#xD;
ef frustrating this design, lest the negro should&#xD;
pay the penalty of their rashness with his life ;&#xD;
a caltvnitjt which Ethingon would have greatly&#xD;
&#xD;
regretted, and a poor. reward for the fidelity&#xD;
which had induced him   to follow his unhappy&#xD;
master into the swamps, chapparels' and prairies&#xD;
of Texas, to urge war upon a people destitute&#xD;
of honor and humanity.&#xD;
6" Let us charge through the foremost of the&#xD;
cowardly curs !"  cried  Ethington..  Turning&#xD;
the heads of their powerful horses in another&#xD;
direction, slinging their rifles upon their backs,&#xD;
and grasping their pistols, they bore down upon&#xD;
the Mexicans at an increased speed. This sud.&#xD;
den manoeuvre took them by surprise, as they&#xD;
had not supposed it possible that two men could&#xD;
have the audacity to charge a dozen.&#xD;
Before they had time to reflect much, upon&#xD;
the subject, Ethington and the ranger were in&#xD;
their midst, overturning several of their small&#xD;
mustangs by the violence of the charge. Firing&#xD;
their pistols at the nearest, they dashed on with.&#xD;
out a wound or a. scratch,-and in three minutes&#xD;
from that time were safely in the cabin, much&#xD;
to the satisfaction of Felix, who had heard the&#xD;
screaming and yelling of the enemy, and. ex-&#xD;
pected every moment to see them thundering up&#xD;
to the door. The horses were led in, the door&#xD;
barricaded in a proper manner, and other pre-&#xD;
parations for defence made. These necessary&#xD;
preliminaries were scarcely accomplished, when&#xD;
the 'enemy came in sight,,.upon the most open&#xD;
side of the little fort--that which bordered upon&#xD;
a small prairie or tract of pasture land. They&#xD;
halted about two hundred yards from the cabin,&#xD;
and appeared to be holding a council of war.&#xD;
"See the 'tarnal critters !" exclaimed Wil-&#xD;
son, angrily; "huddled together like a flock o'&#xD;
sheep. If they were Kentuckians or Texans,&#xD;
we shouldn't stand no chance at all of our lives;&#xD;
for they'd pull this'log hut down about our ears&#xD;
in a twinklin'. Let's -give . 'em a touch of&#xD;
American shooting."&#xD;
"Go it, massa Kentuck !" cried Fehx, get&#xD;
ting somewhat excited witli the idea of knock'&#xD;
ing a Mexican out of his saddle, without giving&#xD;
him time enough to say an are, or a pater nos&#xD;
ter. Their, rifles were thrust carefullyy through&#xD;
the crevices which were to serve as port holes&#xD;
The Mexicans were busily engaged in talking&#xD;
shouting and gesticulating.&#xD;

A RUSE DE&#xD;
&#xD;
GUEIRE" THE CONFLICT RENEWED.&#xD;
&#xD;
A°a short time several of the enemy appeared&#xD;
bearing a white flag; and not daring to vend&#xD;
tine very near, by screaming and hallooing,&#xD;
gnified that they wished to carry off their dead&#xD;
angounded. This they were permitted to do&#xD;
withodt(interruption; but the business appeared&#xD;
to proceed very slowly, and they returned sev-&#xD;
eral times, when it might reasonably have been&#xD;
supposed theycould have accomplished the task&#xD;
in less, than half the time.&#xD;
Supposing that the fighting was ended, Felix&#xD;
Began to unbar the door, under the impression&#xD;
farther precaution was unnecessary. He&#xD;
l4 scarcely removed the fastenings, when there&#xD;
was a sudden rush from the woods upon, the&#xD;
rear of the cabin, and. renewed shouting and&#xD;
firing. While the others had been attracting&#xD;
the attention of Ethington and his comrades;&#xD;
these had been advancing cautiously on foot in&#xD;
another direction ; and now threw themselves&#xD;
against the door with a violence that burst it&#xD;
open instantly. The two foremost fell dead&#xD;
upoh the,threshold before the rifles of Walter&#xD;
and the ranger, and the head of' a third was&#xD;
&#xD;
dashed in pieces by a tremendous blow from&#xD;
Felix.&#xD;
The ruse having proved thus successful'&#xD;
thole who had been ostensibly engaged in carry'&#xD;
ing away the wounded, now came running to&#xD;
the assistance of their companions, and a most&#xD;
desperate and bloody conflict immediately en&#xD;
sued. The numbers of the enemy ha(not been&#xD;
correctly estimated ; for, notwithstanding those&#xD;
that they had lost, and those rendered incapable&#xD;
of fighting by their wounds, there were still&#xD;
eleven to contend with our gallant fellows.&#xD;
" Strike home I" cried Ethington.&#xD;
" Hrra for old Kerituck I" exclaimed Wil&#xD;
son. "Give it to the 'tarnal critters 1"&#xD;
"Go yer deth, massa debbil I" yelled Felix&#xD;
exerting his gigantic strength in a manner which&#xD;
defied all opposition, and forced the enemy to&#xD;
give ground inch by inch, leaving several of&#xD;
their numbers hors du combat, and some who&#xD;
would never fight again.  As there was U1&#xD;
room enough in the cabin for them to use their&#xD;
clubbed rifles with sufficient effect,, they were&#xD;
thrown aside, and that fatal weapon drawn, e&#xD;
&#xD;
well known in the south and southwest-the&#xD;
bowie-knife-and the work of slaughter com-&#xD;
menced in earnest.&#xD;
It was fortunate for our heroes that all the&#xD;
enemy could not enter and fall upon them  at&#xD;
once; otherwise the conflict might soon have&#xD;
been brought to a close.&#xD;
The horses, frightened at the struggle going&#xD;
on about them, became restive, reared and&#xD;
plunged, and finally broke through the Mexicans,&#xD;
who were forcing themselves in at the door, and&#xD;
gained the open air, leaving more room within&#xD;
for the fight to go on.&#xD;
This sudden movement of the terrified beasts&#xD;
somewhat disconcerted the enemy, but soon&#xD;
proved for their advantage ; in a moment after&#xD;
Ethington and his friends were completely hem-&#xD;
med in, and there seemed but little prospect of&#xD;
tieir coming out of the melee alive. Each did&#xD;
his best, and with the much dreaded bowie-knife,&#xD;
dealt those deadly thrusts which tell so fearfully&#xD;
upon the body of an adversary, and which baffle&#xD;
so effectually the skill of the surgeon.&#xD;
But the strongest arm is not iron, and must-&#xD;
feel at length that weariness consequent upon&#xD;
long exertion ; and it g,ew evident that a con-&#xD;
flict so unequal could not last 'much longer.&#xD;
The Mexicans bgme more cautious as their&#xD;
numbers decreased, and though they fought des-&#xD;
perately, observed more prudence in their as-&#xD;
saults., Felix and an athletic fellow had grap-&#xD;
pled with each other in an embrace which was&#xD;
to yield only to the embraces of death, on one&#xD;
side or the other, and were now upon the ground,&#xD;
struggling with all. the fury of mortal late.&#xD;
They rolled over and, over, writhed, twisted,&#xD;
and mutually strained every nerve, while two or&#xD;
three of the enemy stood with uplifted swords&#xD;
to put an end to the conflict when an opportu-&#xD;
nity should offer ; but the evolutions of the com-'&#xD;
batantsw'ere so rapid, that t hey could not strike&#xD;
without endangering thercomrade.&#xD;
At length the stronghand of Felix found its&#xD;
way to his adversary's throat, and ,closed upon&#xD;
it with all its muscular' force. The efect was&#xD;
mstantoneos; the arms of the Mexican relax-&#xD;
etheir: hol, is face grew purple hiis limbs&#xD;
&#xD;
straightened out, and the next moment the&#xD;
knife of the African- was sheathed in hisleit:&#xD;
The conqueror cast the body from him, aiosa&#xD;
with a triumphant shout, and engaged with ro&#xD;
more with unabated ferocity and energy; ff&#xD;
his frame seemed proof against that elheston&#xD;
which his master and the Kentuckian begainto&#xD;
feel.&#xD;
At that critical juncture, when the fatedfthey&#xD;
day hung doubtful, a new shout was suddenif&#xD;
heard to mingle with the confused sounds of'thh&#xD;
fights--a voice clear as the tones of a 'silvetl&#xD;
trumpet, and fiercer than the neigh of a"i&#xD;
horse.&#xD;
Ethington glanced toward the door, and b&#xD;
held the towering form of lidgley dashing aside,&#xD;
the enemy, as if they were mere children in his&#xD;
way.&#xD;
There's for the death of Travis, and Crock&#xD;
ett, and Bowie !" he cried, dealing a blow with,&#xD;
a good sized hunting axe, which he wield&#xD;
with case, with his right hand, at the medtio&#xD;
of each name. The fighting instantly ceaaed&#xD;
and those who could do so, fled, without loss io&#xD;
time. Six of the eleven were left behindyj3&#xD;
fording ample proofs of Texan prowess.&#xD;
"Up and away !" cried Nidgig.    "    er&#xD;

ing forward by different routes, to effect a junc-&#xD;
tion of their forces at the Comanche crossing, at&#xD;
Trinity river.&#xD;
Santa Anna, hearing that the Convention had,&#xD;
adjourned to Harrisburg, changed his plans&#xD;
somewhat, and marched directly towards that&#xD;
place, with a view to the capture of the new&#xD;
government. The Texan army now numbered&#xD;
only about five hundred and twenty men, but&#xD;
was increased to seven hundred strong by the&#xD;
time they reached San Jacinto. Previous to&#xD;
that event, they had received the disheartening&#xD;
news, that Fannin and his men had been in-&#xD;
humanly massacred at Goliad. This piece of&#xD;
information the general affected to treat with-the&#xD;
greatest contempt, and assured his little band&#xD;
that it was a fabrication of the enemy, in order&#xD;
to frighten them into submission ; although he&#xD;
entertained no doubt in regard to the 'authen-&#xD;
ticity of the report.&#xD;
This policy on the part of Houston proved of&#xD;
great advantage, inasmuch as it prevented de-&#xD;
sertions among his men-an inevitable result,&#xD;
had the astounding news been allowed to spread&#xD;
through the camp uncontradicted. The general&#xD;
did not reach Harrisburg until it had been re-&#xD;
duced to ashes by Santa Anna. The army&#xD;
halted near the smoking ruins, and looked upon&#xD;
them with stern and threatening visages.&#xD;
"Look!" said Houston, to our hero ; " see&#xD;
the work of the tyrant and the assassin. What&#xD;
man is there among us who will not fight, after&#xD;
beholding such a spectacle ?"&#xD;
"He is a craven indeed who will not fight&#xD;
for his liberty, his wife, his children, or his&#xD;
sweetheart," replied Ethington.&#xD;
"We are but a handful,". returned the gen-&#xD;
eral ; " but we will meet the enemy and con-&#xD;
quer, or never leave the field alive. I will give&#xD;
yonder brave fellows a battle-cry which shall&#xD;
endow the arm of each with the strength of three&#xD;
of their adversaries. Let those who love Texas&#xD;
follow me in the approaching fight, and if I'&#xD;
shrink or falter in my duty, may Heaven pun-&#xD;
ish me upon the spot by the ignoble death I&#xD;
should so richly merit."&#xD;
" The man who fought so daringly at the&#xD;
&#xD;
Horse Shoe, can never be justly suspected of,&#xD;
cowardice or want of decision," said Walter.&#xD;
"Without stooping to 'flattery," answeed&#xD;
the general, with a smile, "'I can well affoNd to&#xD;
repay the generous compliment.; for the'bofl&#xD;
deeds of the ' Texan Bravo ' are well knowniStoe&#xD;
me. I feel assured that you will set  our, me4&#xD;
an example that will contribute towards the, suc-&#xD;
cess of our arms. - But," added Houston,.ma&#xD;
friendly voice, " I learn with regret-hatine&#xD;
dark spirit of misanthropy has settled  up&#xD;
you; and in fact, that you are weary of cis-&#xD;
tence. This is not as it should be. . bravO&#xD;
and chivalrous young fellow like you, shoudnf&#xD;
rise above disappointment, and be able tolook'&#xD;
misfortune unflinchingly in the face."&#xD;
"I thank you, general, for your kind words&#xD;
and benevolent intention, and I will only say&#xD;
in reply, that in the hour of battle, you will find&#xD;
me at my post."&#xD;
"I doubt it not, sir," returned the general,&#xD;
kindly.&#xD;
"There's a great deal of the wild hoss in him,&#xD;
with a choice sprinklin' of the alligator. and&#xD;
snappin' turtle," remarked Captain Wilson,&#xD;
who joined them at that moment.&#xD;
"We shall soon need all those excellent&#xD;
qualities," said Houston, good naturedly. "I&#xD;
will answer for him and the Rangers."&#xD;
"When you march us up to face the enemy,&#xD;
general, the voice of Old Kentuck will be heard&#xD;
the loudest in the fight," rejoined Wilson, earn-&#xD;
estly.&#xD;
"'Spress yerself !" exclaimed Felix, exhibit-&#xD;
ing a choice collection of ivory.&#xD;
"'Be silent I" said Ethington.&#xD;
"Can he fight ?" asked Houston, regarding&#xD;
the athletic frame of Felix with evident admira-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"There isn't a better man among us when if*&#xD;
comes to blows," replied Walter.&#xD;
"Heah, heah !" or something of that nature&#xD;
was heard to escape the lips of the African.&#xD;
"He's capable of eating three Mexicans at a&#xD;

sentinels, the dissonant ringing of anss, asni&#xD;
sometimes a hum of voices, was borne to pi&#xD;
ears upon the whispering winds, from the eO&#xD;
my's bivouac. Ethington's thoughts were no&#xD;
engaged with those objects upon which  ;s&#xD;

Grieved and disappointed as he hadbean b;&#xD;

the echoes of the adjacent hills and woodlands ;&#xD;
while the balls spent their fury upon the shel-&#xD;
tering trees, splintering their. trunks and lop-&#xD;
ping off their boughs.&#xD;
After doubling the guard and taking all the&#xD;
precautions which a soldier of his experience&#xD;
thought necessary to prevent a surprise, the&#xD;
general-in-chief wrapped himself in his military&#xD;
cloak, placed his saddle for a pillow, and feel-&#xD;
ing that he had done all which duty required,&#xD;
slept the warrior's sleep, undisturbed by the&#xD;
random shots of the enemy, dreaming of victory&#xD;
on the morrow.&#xD;
The gentle moon rode up into the starry skies,&#xD;
and the goddess of silence at length waved her&#xD;
misty wings over the two armies.    Walter&#xD;
Ethington felt but. little .inclination to sleep.&#xD;
Seated upon one of the field pieces,'he had kept&#xD;

upon the advancing Texans ; but their aim was c1&#xD;
bad, and most of the leaden hail whistled harm- g&#xD;
lessly overtheir heads.&#xD;
" Steady, men i reserve your fire until the li&#xD;
word is given 1" thundered Houston, and well&#xD;
each man obeyed.  When within pistol shot of t&#xD;
the Mexican columns, the word "fire " was r&#xD;
shouted along the Texan lines, and al deadly b&#xD;
volley was poured into the enemy's ranks, pros- I&#xD;
trating them as the winds shake off the leaves a&#xD;
in autumn.   .                               t&#xD;
When they had discharged their pieces, they&#xD;
did not pause to reload them, but rushing for--&#xD;
ward upon the foe, broke them over their heads.c&#xD;
This done, they drew their' pistols from their&#xD;
belts, fired them" with terrible effect, and then&#xD;
threw them  at those nearest them.  Then un-&#xD;
sheathing their bowie-knives, they clambered'&#xD;
over heaps of the slain, and plunged them to the&#xD;
hilt in the bodies of those in the rear.  Thus&#xD;
the work of slaughter went on, and the red&#xD;
demon of carnage rode triumphant over that&#xD;
prairie, so peaceful and bloodless an hour ago.,&#xD;
The right and left-wing of the Mexican army&#xD;
gave way before the irresistible -harge of' the&#xD;
Texans; but the centre remained 'firm, and&#xD;
strove with desperate energy to withstand the&#xD;
shock. At this critical period Santa Anna pre&#xD;
pared to charge the   Texan infantry at the&#xD;
head of five hundred of his best mtn.  Houston&#xD;
instantly pei-ceived-the danger,.and rallying his&#xD;
men and putting himself at tmir head,-stood his&#xD;
ground manfully, and shouting the battle-cry&#xD;
once more, ordered themn, to fire.&#xD;
"Take good aim !" cried Wilson to his Ran-&#xD;
gers, and the command was well obeyed. When&#xD;
the Te-ans poured forth their leaden storm once&#xD;
more, but thirty-two out of the five hundred&#xD;
who had prepared to charge them     remained&#xD;
among theliving; aid they were instantly made&#xD;
prisoners.&#xD;
A  terrible panic  now  seized the enemy.'&#xD;
They saw their comrades falling on every hand,&#xD;
and felt that they had never encountered such&#xD;
determined foes before.  Masses of the dead,&#xD;
presenting a horrible memento of war, lay piled&#xD;
up where their front ranks had received the&#xD;
&#xD;
charge of the Texans, and' mounting over this;&#xD;
hastly breastwork, those who remembered the&#xD;
Alamo, plunged their reeking blades into the&#xD;
giving men who fought behind them.&#xD;
The prowess of hirelings was not proof against&#xD;
he valor of soldiers who contended for human&#xD;
ights ; they broke and fled, and the slaughter&#xD;
ecame more fearful still.. Towards Vine's,&#xD;
Bridge, the routed remnant of the dictator'a&#xD;
rmy fled ; when they reached the spot where&#xD;
hey had crossed, by straining every .nerve,&#xD;
urged on by the flashing steel of the Texans,&#xD;
and their mad battle-cry, their onsternation&#xD;
cannot be conceived when they saw the stieai&#xD;
rolling darkly on, spanned by no- bridge 'by'&#xD;
which they could escape the fury of their con-&#xD;
querors.&#xD;
Some, with cries of mortal terror, threw them-&#xD;
selves into the water, which, before they had&#xD;
sunk for the last time, and while the pains of&#xD;
suffocation yet held tihetni was stained witli. th&#xD;
blood of their coinpaniioins in arms ; an hen&#xD;
they went downto rise no more, the fi b1 -&#xD;
ls that marked the spot where they: disapepOO&#xD;
ed, were red'as the currents which had  arme&#xD;
their own hearts. "Remember 'te e1no,'&#xD;
were the last sounds that greeted the ears of'the&#xD;
despaning wretches.&#xD;
At the place where the bridge had 'been cut&#xD;
away, many turned and fought, while' some fall&#xD;
ing upon their knees, criel out in tone  at&#xD;
long haunted the ears of Ethingfn, that they&#xD;
were not at the Alamo. But what did that&#xD;
avail with men who felt that they had}been&#xD;
wronged past reparation, and by the' 'trea#tnen&#xD;
which they had received from their foes, no lon;&#xD;

Side by side 'with Captain Wilson, 'atd followed&#xD;

THINGTON walked slowly towards the&#xD;
t  bivouac of the previous night, to which&#xD;
e soldiers, wearied of the work of slaughter,&#xD;
ere returning in squads, without much regard&#xD;
order. It was' now night, and our hero&#xD;
ought of his appointment with Wikoff. Stretch-.&#xD;
g himself by a fire which the Rangers had&#xD;
ndled, and ; ordering Felix to awaken him&#xD;
hen the moon had arisen, he was soon lost in&#xD;
eep, dreaming of the horrors of the day, and&#xD;
pry possibly of Andrea St. Aubert.&#xD;
Faithful to his charge, the African awakened&#xD;
s master at the time designated. Captain&#xD;
Filson was seated near him, repairing his rifle,&#xD;
which had been somewhat injured in the fight.&#xD;
thington had already made him acquainted&#xD;
th the strange appointment, and asked his&#xD;
rvices, which were offered with that genuine,&#xD;
ough rough cordiality, which characterized the&#xD;
nest Kentuckian.&#xD;
Provided with proper arms, they now repair-&#xD;
I to the spot indicated by Wikoff. They stood&#xD;
the waters of the San Jacinto-waters which&#xD;
d quenched the flame of more than one life&#xD;
&#xD;
that day. Occasionally there floated past them&#xD;
some mournful remnants of the fight-.a hat, a&#xD;
cap, some fragment of a garment, and anon a&#xD;
lifeless body. While Ethington gazed upon the&#xD;
inanimate clay, as it was being borne onward by&#xD;
the current, he asked himself if it had ever 'en&#xD;
shrined an immortal soul, and if so, what was&#xD;
the fate of that soul? He turned from it with&#xD;
a sigh, remarking :&#xD;
- " How many that feared death as the greatest&#xD;
evil, have found it since the sun crossed the&#xD;
meridian ; while I, who have regarded it as a&#xD;
friend that comes to hush up the sorrows of 'the&#xD;
feverish heart, have been spared. Strange that&#xD;
the bolts of death should pass me by, and spend&#xD;
their force upon others. Inscrutable are the&#xD;
ways of Providence."   I&#xD;
The moon was looking down upon the river&#xD;
with a tranquil light. The hour seemed :too&#xD;
quiet for bloodshed, and was better suited to&#xD;
meditation and serious thought, than to the busi-&#xD;
ness which had called our hero aid his friend to&#xD;
the spot.&#xD;
Wikoff did not make his appearanceana&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;

<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7613-00000017"/>&#xD;
86                             THE TEXA&#xD;
Ethington paced slowly up and down awaiting&#xD;
him, while Wilson seated himself beneath an oak,.&#xD;
thinking, doubtless of Marianna Lee. At the&#xD;
expiration of half an hour, the figure of a man&#xD;
emerged cautiously from the copse of trees. It&#xD;
was Wikoff. He appeared disappointed when&#xD;
he saw Ethington, and stood irresolute; but the&#xD;
keen eyes of the ranger were fixed upon him,&#xD;
and he instantly signified that they were await-&#xD;
ing him.&#xD;
"So you have survived the conflict ?" said&#xD;
Wikoff, approaching Ethington.&#xD;
" My presence seems to justify that conclu-&#xD;
sion," replied the latter, coldly.&#xD;
'It strikes me that you didn't expect to see&#xD;
un, observed the captain.               '&#xD;
" No matter what I expected," returned&#xD;
Wikoff.  "I am here, and ready to proceed.&#xD;
Have you brought weapons ?"&#xD;
" I have," answered Wilson. " What dis-&#xD;
tance do you propose ?"&#xD;
"Twelve paces," said Wikoff.&#xD;
" Arrange it as you will," added Ethington.&#xD;
makes no difference to me."&#xD;
The Kentuckian now paced off the ground.&#xD;
"On which side do you intend to place me?"&#xD;
asked Wikoff.&#xD;
4 :Upon that nearest the river," replied the&#xD;
" And.is that a specimen of your fairness'?&#xD;
'  potest'against it, for my adversary will have&#xD;
all the advantage of the light. No, sir, I will&#xD;
not stand up tq be shot in that way. Measure&#xD;
the ground in another direction, or let me have&#xD;
hQ,.other side !" exclaimed Wikoff, with a scowl&#xD;
Y  ftdisapprobation.&#xD;
Don't show too much of the snappin' turtle,"&#xD;
said Wilson, briefly.&#xD;
"You had -better comply with his wishes,"&#xD;
suggested Walter. The ground was now meas-&#xD;
ured off according to the directions of Wikoff,&#xD;
pad the parties tooktheir places. Wikoff found&#xD;
fault with the weapons which the ranger had,&#xD;
brought, and concluded to use his own; and&#xD;
~his ,wa also agreed to by Ethington. Wilson&#xD;
was to count three, and the word three was to&#xD;
he the signalto, fire,&#xD;
&#xD;
N BRAVO.&#xD;
Ethington appeared as calm as usual, and be-&#xD;
trayed no anxiety for the result. He had be.&#xD;
held all the preparations unmoved, and in fact&#xD;
with total indifference.- Not so with Wikoff;&#xD;
his cheeks which were flushed when he first ap.&#xD;
peared, were now pale to ghastliness; while a&#xD;
sickly and sinister smile rested upon his lips,&#xD;
Deadly hatred and hostility were vividly traced&#xD;
in the expression of his whole visage. Though&#xD;
his arm did not shake when he took his stand,&#xD;
and tle weapons were placed in his hands, he.&#xD;
was evidently suffering from some emotion, anx-&#xD;
iety or fear.&#xD;
" Now, gentlemen, do not fire until I have&#xD;
pronounced the word three," said Wilson, tak.&#xD;
ing a position equi-distant from the parties.&#xD;
" Have you any word to leave for Andrea St.&#xD;
Aubert ?" asked Wikoff, in a sneering tone to&#xD;
Ethington.&#xD;
" Captain Wilson, I am ready," said Walter,&#xD;
calmly.&#xD;
"Are you ready, sir ?" asked Wilson, turn-&#xD;
ing to Wikoff.&#xD;
" All ready," responded the latter, with, the&#xD;
same sinister smile.&#xD;
" Then, gentlemen, remember the directions,&#xD;
and fire. after the word. three, for I want this&#xD;
thing to be done fair, and in a way that wouldn't&#xD;
disgrace Old Kentuck itself.4&#xD;
Wilson paused a moment, looked steadily at&#xD;
the parties to see how they bore themselves;&#xD;
and then proceeded, apparently well satisfied&#xD;
with the deportment of Ethington.&#xD;
"Gentlemen, I shall now give you the word:&#xD;
One!"&#xD;
There was no change perceptible in the fea&#xD;
tures or attitude of Walter ; but his antagonist&#xD;
grew paler, if possible, and smiled more fright-&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
"Two!"&#xD;
Instantly Wikoff fired, in defiance of all the&#xD;
rules of honor, before the word three had been&#xD;
spoken. Ethington's arm fell to, his side, the&#xD;
pistol dropped from his grasp, he tottered a step&#xD;
and sank to the ground.&#xD;
.With a hasty imprecation uporz Wikoff, who&#xD;
turned and fled, the ranger ran to his friend and&#xD;
&#xD;
raised him from the -earth. Walter looked up t&#xD;
into the face of the Kentuckian, smiled sweetly,&#xD;
and immediately became unconscious. Wilson&#xD;
took him in his arms, and bore him swiftly to-&#xD;
wards the Texan encampment, where a surgeon&#xD;
was hastily summoned.&#xD;
When Ethington's mind regained somethingI&#xD;
of its former lucidity, he found himself in a dark-&#xD;
cued room, lying upon a comfortable bed. He&#xD;
heard soft footsteps and whispered words, like&#xD;
those breathed in the chamber of the sick. A&#xD;
young lady was seated near his bedside, whom,&#xD;
upon closer scrutiny, he discovered to be Marian-&#xD;
na. Our heras conscious of being very weak,&#xD;
and was sensible that he must have been very&#xD;
ill. He glanced silently about the apartment&#xD;
once more, but saw no familiar object, with the&#xD;
exception of the maiden.&#xD;
" Marianna'?" he said, in a feeble voice.&#xD;
Instantly a gleam of satisfaction passed over&#xD;
the face of the young lady.&#xD;
"Then you remember me, at last !" she ex-&#xD;
claimed.  "I am glad to see your consciousness&#xD;
returning. Yqu have been very ill, and we&#xD;
have sometimes despaired of your life."&#xD;
"And, I am indebted to you for much -good&#xD;
nursing, and probably my life," he added.&#xD;
Marianna was about to make a reply, when&#xD;
the door was opened, and a youth entered with&#xD;
light and noiseless footsteps. It needed no se-&#xD;
cond look to assure him that it was the same&#xD;
that he had seen 'with Ridgley, though dressed&#xD;
in different style. He now wore a black frock,&#xD;
and pants, of fine fabric, and which fitted very&#xD;
neatly to his person, and became him well; -and&#xD;
together with a light buff vest, silk neck tie, and&#xD;
Byron collar; all adjusted with a graceful negli-&#xD;
gence, gave him rather a dandyish appearance.&#xD;
Walter was prejudiced against the lad at the&#xD;
first glance, and though he could not but ac-&#xD;
knowledge that he was very good looking, he&#xD;
turned his eyes from him, mentally resolving to&#xD;
notice him as little as common courtesy would&#xD;
possibly allow.&#xD;
" To this kind youth you are much indebted&#xD;
for your recovery," said Marianna. "It is&#xD;
SAugustus Henrie, a cousiA' of mine ; who,&#xD;
38.&#xD;
&#xD;
though he has his eccentricities, is a very b&#xD;
cellent lad at heart. I assure you, Mr. Etbing4&#xD;
ton, his attentions have been unremitting.&#xD;
Ethington reluctantly turned his eyes towad&#xD;
the youth again.&#xD;
"I am very much obliged to you, my youna&#xD;
friend, I am sure, and hope I may be permitted&#xD;
to acknowledge the kindness in a more substin-&#xD;
tial way," he said, with considerable effort.&#xD;
Augustus Ienrie averted his eyes ;modestly,;&#xD;
and appeared confused; buttrallied immediately#&#xD;
and replied with tolerable grace and assurance:&#xD;
"To tell the truth, sir (which they say mst&#xD;
not be spoken at all times), I have done bit'ra&#xD;
very little to contribute towards your recovery,&#xD;
or happiness ; and to my fair cousin, Marianna,&#xD;
you owe all your thanks."&#xD;
Walter fixed his gaze once more upon the&#xD;
large, dreamy eyes of Augustus, and deterinm&#xD;
ed yet again not to like him.&#xD;
"I evidently owe a debt of gratitude: to seao&#xD;
person or persons, and I am content to- pay the&#xD;
larger share to Marianna. Will that do; .in&#xD;
lad ?"&#xD;
"I am content," replied Augustus.  "But'&#xD;
how is this'?  I did not expect to find your-i&#xD;
tional. It gives me great pleasure to see:yop&#xD;
thus."&#xD;
"How long have I been' ill?" asked Ethingf1&#xD;
ton, turning to Marianna.&#xD;
-"-The battle of San Jacinto wassfought th'ee&#xD;
days ago," she replied.&#xD;
"It has not seemed as many hours."&#xD;
"Probably not, which is a very good thing,&#xD;
as you were not sensible of your sufferings and&#xD;
danger."&#xD;
"Have I talked very wildly'?" he asked,&#xD;
anxiously.&#xD;
" You have talked considerably, and that&#xD;
question reminds me of what the physician told&#xD;
me ; that I must not permit you to talk much if&#xD;
you should recover your consciousness. I must&#xD;
now enforce obedience."&#xD;
"I shall endeavor to submit gracefully," he&#xD;
replied, with a faint smile ; " for to tell the&#xD;
truth, I do not feel very strong."&#xD;
Augustus now withdrew, and Walter was&#xD;

ide him. He took. some medicine from- his&#xD;
hafid attendant, and, did not awake again&#xD;
peilsiepr(morning; when the youth. was still&#xD;
ing#,ythe bedvery-patiently.&#xD;
Ethington observed him for a moment through&#xD;

ableswihis elbow. upon it,? and his forehead&#xD;
mpsing. inthe:palmof his hand. , His features&#xD;

op id(nnaid some. strayringlets of his long,&#xD;

aDpi the antipathy whichaEthington had&#xD;
taken to Augustus, he was candid enough to'&#xD;
wdmit there was something interesting and at.-&#xD;
&#xD;
tractive about him, which under other circum-&#xD;
stances might. ,have won. his friendship; but he&#xD;
could not forget that he had;twice seen him with&#xD;
Ridghey. Walter's heart accused him, of ingrat.&#xD;
itude.. Had not this. youth befriended him,&#xD;
and passed many sleepless hours by his couch of&#xD;
suflbring 2 He resolved to conquer his, pre-&#xD;
judice.&#xD;
In a kindly voice he urged the boy to retire,&#xD;
or allow Felix. to take. his place.  Augustus&#xD;
assured him that he felt no weariness, but if he&#xD;
preferrd. the. society of his colored servant, he&#xD;
would leave hin. Ethington answered that he&#xD;
must. be sadly in want of sleep, and under the&#xD;
circumstances- he should prefer Felix.  The&#xD;
youth withdrew, and as his light, and symmetri..&#xD;
cal figure disappeared, Walter sighed, and felt&#xD;
that he was ungrateful to the kind and unpre-&#xD;
suming lad.&#xD;
Felix manifested unfeigned joy. at the pros-&#xD;
pect of his master's recovery, which: he. had&#xD;
hitherto despaired of, and declared-his fixed in-&#xD;
tention of punishing Captain Wilson for leading&#xD;
him intodanger.  He said he should " 'spress&#xD;
hisself freely on that subjeck, and teach Massa&#xD;
Kentuck to promulgate," in a different direc-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Ethington-now. learned, with much satisfac-&#xD;
tion,. of the 'capture of- Santa Anna.  Felix&#xD;
described very minutely his appearance, and the,&#xD;
interview with General Houston, in which, he&#xD;
styled himself, in the, true spirit;of arrogance,&#xD;
the "Napoleon of the. West."&#xD;
&#xD;
T   IME   passed on.  April came with its&#xD;
showers and sunshine.  It was a warm,&#xD;
clear day ; the sun had passed the meridian.&#xD;
A man was standing upon the east bank of the&#xD;
Nueces river, looking thoughtfully into the&#xD;
water. Just above him, on the right, was a&#xD;
thick chapparel, and below was a broad strip&#xD;
of bottom-land or interval.&#xD;
He turned slowly and walked towards the&#xD;
latter, and approaching the water, commenced'&#xD;
washing out his rifle, While he was thus em-&#xD;
ployed, another person appeared at the extremi-&#xD;
ty of the bottom-land, and after scrutinizing him&#xD;
for a few seconds, advanced, though not without&#xD;
some hesitation.&#xD;
"Washing out your shootin' iron ?" he ob-&#xD;
served, when within a few yards of the individual&#xD;
first mentioned.&#xD;
" Yes;" replied the party addressed, gruffly.&#xD;
"It don't require much penetration to see&#xD;
that."-&#xD;
" I think I shall follow your example," added&#xD;
the other, nothing daunted by the very courte--&#xD;
ous reply.&#xD;
&#xD;
"As you will; there is plenty of water."&#xD;
" So it would seem," replied the new-coiner,&#xD;
somewhat testily ; and immediately set u&#xD;
cleansing his rifle.&#xD;
The other party completed his task; and sit-&#xD;
ting down upon the grass, observed the stranger&#xD;
with considerable interest.&#xD;
"Perhaps you belong to the R ng rs?" h&#xD;
remarked, at length.&#xD;
" Perhaps I don't," was the briefirejoinder:&#xD;
"Did'you fight at San Jacinto?"&#xD;
"I can't say that I did particularly. I look&#xD;
out for number one, principally."&#xD;
"That's the rule I go upon, and I find it&#xD;
works very well. I hope you wont be offended&#xD;
if I ask your name ?"&#xD;
"You seemed to be rather short with me just&#xD;
now, but I don't mind telling you my= ide.&#xD;
I am called'Cogswell."&#xD;
" A very good name, I am sure.  Iii retiil&#xD;

lyikoff smiled, and asked if he had been long&#xD;
in that part of the country. Cogswell replied&#xD;
that he had not.&#xD;
"It appears somewhat singular,"   added&#xD;
Wikoff; "that you do not take part in the&#xD;
struggle now going on between the Texans and&#xD;
t   Mexicans'?"&#xD;
"I have business enough of my own to at-&#xD;
tend to," answered Cogswell, with a scowl.&#xD;
Some enemy to punish, or possibly some&#xD;
fair girl to woo," replied Wikoff, lightly, at the&#xD;
same time watching the countenance of Cogs-&#xD;
rell with the greatest interest.&#xD;
With a quiet smile of satisfaction he saw the&#xD;
blood rush tumultuously to his face, and knew&#xD;
that he had touched the right chord at last.&#xD;
- " Stranger, you seem to be rather inquisitive,&#xD;
but in your last remark you wasn't far from the&#xD;
truth. I have an enemy to punish, and there&#xD;
Us a fair maiden I would win."&#xD;
"Spoken like a brave fellow   and a true&#xD;
ran 1" exclaimed Wikoff, with warmth. "I&#xD;
perceive that you are made of the right kind of&#xD;
material. I see plainly that we are destined to&#xD;
beome good friends, and who knows but we&#xD;
iny be of mutual service to each other ; for I&#xD;
also have an enemy to punish."&#xD;
. ive us your bread-hook !" said Cogswell,&#xD;
with some enthusiasm. "You're a smart chap,&#xD;
ap#. we shall get on,well together."&#xD;
" Very happy to make your acquaintance.&#xD;
Our meeting appears to be quite providential.&#xD;
I am glad you do not belong to the Rangers."&#xD;
. Ihate the Rangers, and the captain more&#xD;
than all."&#xD;
IJgguess your secret ; he's your rival, doubt-&#xD;
I own up to the charge," responded Cogs-&#xD;
"Now this is a very singular coincidence, sir,&#xD;
for the man whom I can endure least of all men&#xD;
living als6 belongs to the Rangers,. or at least&#xD;
eis:with then. The captain's name is Wilson,&#xD;
I believe ?"&#xD;
"I have met him," contioned Wikoff.&#xD;
&#xD;
"lHe's much attached to a harum scarum&#xD;
fellow, sometimes called the 'Texan Bravo,'&#xD;
but whose name I think is Ethington."&#xD;
"That's my man," added Wikoff, contract-&#xD;
ing his brows fiercely.&#xD;
"He was wounded in a duel, I heard, and&#xD;
came near dying. Perhaps you're the chap&#xD;
that drew trigger upon him ?"&#xD;
'I have rio wish to deny it.. I only regret&#xD;
that my aim was not better. Sit down here,&#xD;
and I will speak plainly. I once loved a maid-&#xD;
en; her name was Andrea. St. Aubert. A&#xD;
favorable opportunity offered and I declared my&#xD;
passion. The result you have doubtless antici-&#xD;
pated. I was rejected. A short time after, I&#xD;
saw her with a young gentleman. . I inquired&#xD;
his name, and was told that it was Walter&#xD;
Ethington, a favored lover. This information&#xD;
filled me with indignation, and I resolved to&#xD;
break up the engagement in a way that would&#xD;
be deeply humiliating to both, more especially&#xD;
to Ethington. I accordingly set my wits at&#xD;
work, and succeeded as well as I could have&#xD;
wished. The particulars of the plot by whIch I&#xD;
accomplished my purpose, I will not at this time&#xD;
divulge. Grieved and mortified at the-supposed&#xD;
perfidy of Andrea, Ethington carne to Texas and&#xD;
joined in the struggle against te dictator of,&#xD;
Mexico.&#xD;
When the surprise of Miss Aubert had in&#xD;
some measure subsided, I again ventured to re-&#xD;
new the old subject, and was more decidedly&#xD;
rejected than before. Soon- after this event she&#xD;
suddenly disappeared, and it was rumored that&#xD;
she had gone to visit an uncle residing in Texas.&#xD;
Determined to carry my point, I immediately&#xD;
came hither, resolved that if I cquhl not sue-&#xD;
ceed in winning her affections, to be near to&#xD;
prevent any explanation between her and her&#xD;
lover."&#xD;
"And perhaps do more than that," added&#xD;
Cogswell.&#xD;
"That is true ; I would," replied Wikoff.&#xD;
"I cannot tolerate him-he is a serpent in my&#xD;
path. I would place my. heel upon him and&#xD;
destroy him."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TEXAN BRAVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
There is every chance for you to do so,'&#xD;
answered Cogswell. "The Rangers are en&#xD;
camped only a couple of miles below here, and&#xD;
he is with them. It would be easy to surpris&#xD;
him in his walks, and-"&#xD;
"I understand ; but there is a colored fellow&#xD;
with him, who scarcely ever leaves him, and it&#xD;
would be more difficult to deal with him than&#xD;
with his master."&#xD;
"Serve him the same way," said Cogswell.&#xD;
"And what will you do with Captain Wil-&#xD;
son ?" asked Wikoff.&#xD;
"Just what you would do with Ethington, if&#xD;
you had him in your power. Have you found&#xD;
this Miss St. Aubert yet'?"&#xD;
Wikoff hesitated a 'moment, and then an-&#xD;
swered:&#xD;
"I have reason to suppose that I have ; but&#xD;
I will not speak of the subject at this time, for&#xD;
reasons of my own. If Ihave found her, I will&#xD;
keep my own secret, for the present. And now&#xD;
let us devise some method of carrying out our&#xD;
mutual wishes in regard t6 these two men, whom&#xD;
we consider our enemies."&#xD;
To this proposal Cogswell readily assented ;&#xD;
the two then proceeded to plan a nefarious&#xD;
scheme for the destruction of Ethington and&#xD;
Wilson.  The conversation continued for a long&#xD;
time. The parties came to a very good under-&#xD;
standing, and appeared mutually pleased with&#xD;
each other. But Wikoff was evidently the&#xD;
shrewdest of the two; he had the deepest knowl-&#xD;
edge of human nature, and sufficient skill to&#xD;
make a mere tool of Cogswell.&#xD;
When everything had been talked over and&#xD;
arranged in regard to their future proceedings,&#xD;
they walked towards the spot where the Texan&#xD;
Rangers were encamped.&#xD;
It will be well for us to remark in this place,&#xD;
that after the capture of Santa Anna, most of&#xD;
the Mexican forces had withdrawn to the west&#xD;
side of the Rio Grande ; but quietness and or-&#xD;
der was by no means restored to the frontiers&#xD;
of the Lone Star. Bexar was still harassed by&#xD;
marauding parties-of the enemy, and by lawless&#xD;
banditti, who carried on a kind of guerrilla war-&#xD;
fare, to~the great annoyance of the inhabitants.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Rangers had accordingly been stated&#xD;
- there to punish offenders, and preserve pae&#xD;
l and order. It will be seen by the foregoing&#xD;
e that our hero had recovered from his wounds,&#xD;
and had accompanied the party to whoi he had&#xD;
become attached, and whose dangers he had&#xD;
t shared at San Jacinto.&#xD;
As Wikoff and Cogswell neared the encaui&#xD;
meant they advanced with more cautiousness, and&#xD;
when they came within sight of it, conealed&#xD;
- themselves from observation in some museiit&#xD;
bushes.&#xD;
f   It happened to be the hour on which the&#xD;
Rangers were wont to parade ; accordingly they&#xD;
were formed and went through various eolia-&#xD;
tions in fine style, , after which they practised&#xD;
target shooting.&#xD;
Whether Wikoff and Cogswell did not expe-&#xD;
rience sensations of shame at seeing those braves&#xD;
men disciplining themselves in warlike arts, in&#xD;
order to defend their country and repel tyraniiy,&#xD;
we do not know ; but it is certain tht they&#xD;
should have felt such emotions, if theirsouls get&#xD;
retained a single spark of patriotism.&#xD;
At a short distance from the company sted.&#xD;
Ethington, observing their evolution  with-1&#xD;
terest ; and near him was the faithful Felix'&#xD;
"There," said Wikoff, pointing at ,1ie for-&#xD;
mer, ",you behold my enemy."&#xD;
"And I must say that he is not a bad lok-&#xD;
ing man," replied Cogswell. "Thoujh like&#xD;
him not, he has a fine figure, a pleasing cunte-&#xD;
nance, and the reputation of being rashybred ;&#xD;
qualities which are very likely to make him a&#xD;
dangerous rival.&#xD;
Wikoff muttered something' indistin 4e-&#xD;
tween his teeth, and glanced indignantly at hi&#xD;
new friend.&#xD;
"You do well to try to get him out of tine&#xD;
way, if Andrea St. Aubert is inclined to love&#xD;
him," added Cogswell.&#xD;
Wikoff bit his lip and remained moodily sent.&#xD;
The former resumed.&#xD;
" That straight, independent looking fellow&#xD;
is the captain of the Rangers. He is as hateful&#xD;
to my sight as the 'Texan Bravo' can',. to&#xD;
yours. He bears upon his person a  oudof&#xD;

The 'most difficult part of the business re-&#xD;
,n i erto be done;" interrupted Wikoff.&#xD;
# e  What is that!?" asked Cogswell.&#xD;
"T'o win Mrianna Lee."&#xD;
Cogswell sighed heavily, and gave utterance&#xD;
rething that sounded like an oath; for he&#xD;
fajtuh astness ofthe-remark.&#xD;
4ilAt that moment Felix was observed to leave&#xD;
i  ;a wster's side and walk up the river. He&#xD;
passed the spot where Wikoff and his ally were&#xD;
n9 #1d, singing a favorite negro melody.&#xD;
od f Let'us-follow him," said Wikoff, and the&#xD;
wythy pair immediately left their hiding-place,&#xD;
Ti4 eted upon the suggestion.' Felix saunter-&#xD;
ed on for the distance of half a mile, wholly un-&#xD;
esejiusthat :his.movements were watched.&#xD;
Let us seize hin,'" added Wikoff.&#xD;
' *greed," said the other, and both rushed&#xD;
pt peliz ;and caught him by the arms ; he&#xD;
*aiggWe violently, and shook them off. - Wikoff&#xD;
jstmtly levelled his rifle &amp;amp;t the African's head,&#xD;
and threatened to shoot him, if he.did not sub-&#xD;
ilpeeea ly to their wishes. Felix looked at&#xD;
4 twppesentedri-fle with alarm, and asked what&#xD;
they: vted.&#xD;
So e awith i, and do not resist," replied&#xD;
Wikoff.  "Tie his hands, Cogswell, and if he&#xD;
, ;will shoot him."&#xD;
(ogawell;took the belt which he wore about&#xD;

&#xD;
"Fire, massadebbil --go yer death !" cried&#xD;
Felix, while heimade ashield of Cogswell, who&#xD;
struggled in vain tofree himself from the strong&#xD;
arms which held him. This demonstration on&#xD;
the part of the negro put Wikoff in a rage, and&#xD;
he would gladly have shot him down without&#xD;
remorse, could he have done .so without danger&#xD;
to Cogswell; but he:could not, and it was in&#xD;
vain that he tried.&#xD;
"Knock him over the head with the breech&#xD;
of your rifle; crack his skull !" exclaimed&#xD;
Cogswell,&#xD;
" rSpress yerself ; promulgate," said Felix,&#xD;
watchingithe movements of Wikoff attentively,&#xD;
who, resolved to follow Cogswell's advice, now&#xD;
cautiously approached the negro with his weapon&#xD;
upraised.&#xD;
The moment came for which Felix had waited;&#xD;
he raised his great fist, dashed Cogswell to the&#xD;
earth,.4nd with a shout sprang upon Wikoff.&#xD;
With his left hand he arrested the descending&#xD;
weapon, and with the other struck a tremendous&#xD;
blow against the forehead of Wikoff, who fell&#xD;
down like an ox that was stricken with a butch-&#xD;
er's axe.&#xD;
"Go it,, white folks ! Yah, yah! ,Heah,&#xD;
heapi!" The next moment at culledd ,nder-&#xD;
vidooal," resembling Felix more than any other&#xD;
person, was seen running very rapidly towards&#xD;
the camp of the Texan Rangers.&#xD;
When Wikoff and Cogswell .recovered some-&#xD;
what from the shock which they had received,&#xD;
they raised themselves slowly upon their elbows&#xD;
and gazed lugubriously into- the faces of each&#xD;
other.&#xD;

F the reader will consent to accompany us to&#xD;
San Antonio de Bexar, we will make him&#xD;
more intiinately acquainted with characters who&#xD;
have hitherto been kept in the back ground, or&#xD;
only casually noticed.&#xD;
We are informed upon credible authority that&#xD;
the only places occupied by a white population&#xD;
in 1821, were the Spanish posts of San Antonio,&#xD;
Nocadoches and (loliad, comprising in all about&#xD;
three thousand inhabitants. Not long after, in&#xD;
consequence -of the inducements held out to set-&#xD;
tiers, there was an extraordinary influx of em-&#xD;
igrants from the United States.&#xD;
Many of those who sought homes in the new&#xD;
country carried with them slaves. Mr. Ridgley&#xD;
was among the early emigrants from the great&#xD;
republic. He haid settled at San Antonio, and&#xD;
accmulateda handsome property by industry&#xD;
and attention to business.&#xD;
It is known that in 1832 the people pf Texas&#xD;
formed a State Cpnstitution, and tried to obtain&#xD;
from the MXkican Congress an :admission into&#xD;
the :confederacy, as an1 independent State. The&#xD;
refusal resulted in an appeal to arms, and after&#xD;
&#xD;
that period, San Antonio de Bexar hd3 uIlit&#xD;
tle rest and tranquillity ; it was subject eii_&#xD;
tinual alarms and invasions from.the enen&#xD;
and fell into their possession several times.._&#xD;
Mr. Ridgley, having taken an active:pa In&#xD;
the war policy, was obliged on several; occasions&#xD;
to seek safety in flight, and bore arms  gsinst&#xD;
the invaders more than once.&#xD;
When the enemy were driven out, he retri-&#xD;
ed to look after his affairs and repair damaes;&#xD;
for war always leaves the imprint of his destgy-&#xD;
ing handuppon everything which falls i d 4s&#xD;
way.&#xD;
Mr. Ridgley owned an elegant unasio4t&#xD;
San Antonio, which had miraculsusly escaped&#xD;
destruction during all the vicissitudes fi the&#xD;
sanguinary struggle, and we now find him oc-&#xD;
cupying it with his family.&#xD;
It was the evening of-the day sueeeed g the&#xD;
events of the last chapter. A gentle-moon ad&#xD;
bright silvery stars illuminated, the reh of the&#xD;
overhanging ski s. Two young odies we e&#xD;

THE TEXA&#xD;
little above the medium height, well-formed&#xD;
and graceful, and bore a striking resemblance&#xD;
to each other. One was Andrea St. Aubert--&#xD;
our heroine-and the other, her cousin Rosalia,&#xD;
Mr. Ridgley's only daughter.&#xD;
"If I thought," said Andrea, looking timidly'&#xD;
at her companion, "that I had overstepped the&#xD;
bounds of maidenly reserve and modesty, I&#xD;
should indeed be deeply mortified."&#xD;
"My fair cousin," replied Bosalia, earnestly,&#xD;
"highly endowed as you are with good sense&#xD;
and noble sentiments, it is quite impossible that&#xD;
you should or could have done aught to cause&#xD;
you a single sigh of regret or blush of shame.&#xD;
"'it is said that each one of us has an angel, and&#xD;
that he keeps a record of all our worthy actions,&#xD;
and I am sure there has been something good&#xD;
accredited to you by his ready pen long before&#xD;
 this hour-.-thoe very deeds which you are now&#xD;
disposed to blush and cry about."&#xD;
A. tear of gratitude moistened the dark eyes&#xD;
of Andrea ; she. pressed her friend's hand in&#xD;
silence.&#xD;
Nkid 4I been placed in your circumstances,&#xD;
uin; I should have attempted to do just&#xD;
ttyou accomplished 'so nobly.' You have a&#xD;
deep conviction that there has been a cruel mis-&#xD;
i 4^  standingon 'the part of-of-"&#xD;
Walter," added Andrea, softly.&#xD;
' On=the part 'of Walter," said Rosalia ;&#xD;
"resulting from the jealousy or malice of some&#xD;
9eon unknown. As your conscience acquits&#xD;
Bitf'giving any realcause of offence, you -have&#xD;

"Rush,'osalia ;  don't flatter me," said&#xD;
Audea    A.                        ..&#xD;
"You have learned that he still loves you,&#xD;

&#xD;
that- your false lover was here, fighting in the&#xD;
Texan army with rash daring, seeking death in&#xD;
the thickest - of- the fight, doing prodigies of&#xD;
valor, and providentially escaping unharmed on&#xD;
most occasions. All that took place 'afterward&#xD;
was done with my approval, and the consent of&#xD;
my father,, your uncle ; for he said, 'it was a&#xD;
pity that two young -'persons who loved each&#xD;
other, should be separated by a trifling misun-&#xD;
derstanding.' Believing as he does in your in-&#xD;
nocence, be assured that he is too proud and&#xD;
noble to compromise you, in any manner what.&#xD;
ever ; and if the truth were known,-has been&#xD;
rather severe with Ethington than otherwise.&#xD;
I am certain that he required your lover to re-&#xD;
turn and ask your pardon upon his kftees."&#xD;
"I am sure he ought to," replied Andrea,&#xD;
with a smile.&#xD;
"And I predict that he will, when the truth&#xD;
is known," added Rosalia.&#xD;
" Hark !" said Andrea. " I thought I&#xD;
heard some one climbing over the wall.".&#xD;
"Where ?" asked Rosalia.&#xD;
"There-in that direction," answered An-&#xD;
drea.&#xD;
" Let us walk towards the spot," said the&#xD;
other.&#xD;
" No let us retire to the house, rejoined her&#xD;
cousin ; but Rosalia drew her along with gentle&#xD;
force towards the spot indicated.&#xD;
"Don't be alarmed, fair ladies,' said a voice.&#xD;
"Pardon this intrusion."  The figure of a tall&#xD;
man emerged from the shrubbery which grew by&#xD;
the wall, and stood before the two girls. He&#xD;
lifted his hat and bowed very low.&#xD;
"Come away," whispered Andrea -to her&#xD;
companion.,&#xD;
" What is your wish, sir ?" asked .losalia.&#xD;
"To speak a few words with Miss St. Au-&#xD;
bert,'' replied the intruder. ' Will you dome&#xD;
the favor to retire a moment, that I may address&#xD;
her alone ?"&#xD;
"No, sir, I will:not ; she has no secrets that&#xD;
she would keep from me. If you have aught to&#xD;
say, speak on, or leave us instantly."&#xD;
"You are pleased to be severe with me,"&#xD;
said 'the man.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TEXA&#xD;
"Do you know   this rude person ?" asked&#xD;
Rlosalia, turning to Andrea.&#xD;
"1His voice sounds familiar. I should say&#xD;
that I had met him  somewhere ; but if so, I&#xD;
have no desire to renew the acquaintance," re-&#xD;
plied Andrea, with a slight shudder.&#xD;
"You hear what Miss St. Aubert says," add-&#xD;
ed Rosalia, firmly.&#xD;
"I do," returned Wikoff, with another bow.&#xD;
"I once presumed to speak to Miss St. Aubert&#xD;
on a certain subject. She was pleased to dis-&#xD;
courage my hopes, and I submitted to my fate&#xD;
as best I might. Since that time I have strug-&#xD;
gled with my .unhappy passion, and I trust.I&#xD;
shall overcome it; at least I shall trouble her&#xD;
no more with the recital of my love ; it were a&#xD;
useless task, and painful withal, and I came not&#xD;
hither to speak of it. I have come to bid her&#xD;
adieu forever."&#xD;
"It is Wikoff !" exclaimed Andrea, trem-&#xD;
blin violently.&#xD;
"Yes, it is that unhappy man,"     sighed&#xD;
Wikoff.  " Suffer me to kneel but one moment&#xD;
at your feet-to press your hand once more to&#xD;
my lips, and then you will be spared the pain,&#xD;
of seeing me again in this world of vicissitude&#xD;
and suffering."&#xD;
While Wikoff was speaking, he advanced&#xD;
quickly, caught the hand of Andrea and sank&#xD;
upon, his knees, pressed it hastily to his lips,&#xD;
and seemed loth to relinquish it.&#xD;
"Go, sir, go !" cried Andrea, much disturb-&#xD;
ed at this unlooked for demonstration. " Leave&#xD;
me, I entreat of you, and let me never behold&#xD;
you again ; your presence makes me miserable ;-&#xD;
I cannot be happy near you."&#xD;
Wikoff released her hand, and arose from his&#xD;
humble posture, while our heroine clung ner-&#xD;
vously to Rosalia for support.&#xD;
" Duty to God and to you, Miss St. Aubert,&#xD;
prompts me to say a few words more before I&#xD;
tear myself from your presence forever. There&#xD;
.is a certain person-I will not speak his name&#xD;
in your pure ears--once favored with some por-&#xD;
tion of your regard, who now vilifies your name,&#xD;
and speaks it and causes it to be spoken where&#xD;
it should not be heard. I have heard the name&#xD;
&#xD;
N BRAVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
of Andrea St. Aubert coupled with the rude&#xD;
jest and ribald song in yonder camp, and my&#xD;
blood has boiled to punish the villain."&#xD;
"You mean Walter Ethington !" cried An-&#xD;
drea, in tones of real anguish.  " You speak&#xD;
falsely--it cannot be-it is not his nature."&#xD;
"Alas," added Wikoff, solemnly, " how&#xD;
prone is the trusting heart to deception. Far&#xD;
be it from me to disturb your tranquillity of&#xD;
mind, or trample upon the hopes which you still&#xD;
fondly cherish. Time will test my friendship&#xD;
and truth, though it cannot heal the wounds of&#xD;
a broken heart. I could have wished, and have&#xD;
wished, and do wish that this man whom you&#xD;
have dleigned to love, were more deserving.of&#xD;
your affections. He deserted you basely-most&#xD;
basely-and seemed insensible of the happiness&#xD;
of being beloved by an angel."&#xD;
Wikoff paused, passed his hand suddenly&#xD;
across his eyes, and then added, still more int-&#xD;
pressively :&#xD;
"Had this youmig man been worthy of-you,&#xD;
I could have resigned all hope =of winning your&#xD;
affections with half the internal strife it is cost&#xD;
ing me ; but let that pass ; the ways of Heaven&#xD;
are inscrutable. .Peerless Andrea, idol of my&#xD;
soul ! I bid you adieu."&#xD;
Wikoff bowed once more, and turning quick-&#xD;
ly, disappeared from view.&#xD;
"Courage," said Rosalia, supporting Andrea,&#xD;
who was nearly unconscious, so much had she&#xD;
been agitated by this strange scene. " He has&#xD;
gone-we are alone."&#xD;
"Forgive this weakness," said Andrea.&#xD;
" The sight of that man always makes me mis-&#xD;
erable. I instinctively shrink from him ; he&#xD;
terrifies me ; he is evil; I know it by intui-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
The young ladies now walked slowly towards&#xD;
the house, Rosalia striving to re-assure and&#xD;
comfort her friend with gentle and hopeful&#xD;
words. Soon after entering the parlor, Andrea&#xD;
discovered that a ring which she had worn upon&#xD;
the third finger of her left hand, was no longer&#xD;
there. She communicated the fact to Rosalia,&#xD;
remarking that it was the only article in her&#xD;
possession which had belonged to Ethington.&#xD;
&#xD;

46                             THE TEXA&#xD;
" Wikoff took your left hand," said Iosalia.&#xD;
"And he has taken the ring," replied An-&#xD;
drea; '. for I had it upon my finger when I&#xD;
went into thegarden."&#xD;
Inthis opinion, MissRidgley fully concurred;&#xD;
she had observed that the ring was rather large,&#xD;
aid couldeasily be slipped- off. This circum-&#xD;
'.tance paused our heroine much pain, for she&#xD;
highly valued the ring, and knew not what use&#xD;
Wikeff might make of it ; and indeed she was&#xD;
et a little vexed at his presumption in daring&#xD;
to possess himself of it in such a manner.&#xD;
While, she was reflecting upon this subject,&#xD;
Mr. Ridgley made his appearance, bringing&#xD;
news of considerable importance.  He had&#xD;
.,,ard that there were a large number of Mexi-&#xD;
cs, flitting sup and down the Nueces river,&#xD;
watching for an'jpportunity to plunder San&#xD;
oAntgnio de-hx'r.&#xD;
"But tfe Texan :Rangers are encamped near&#xD;
ts" said Rosalia. "Are they not sufficiently&#xD;
dtiknto, defend the place ?"&#xD;
" They are 'but -a handful of men, although&#xD;
th r number has been doubled since the battle&#xD;
ofMab Jacinto,:and the enemy are said to ex-&#xD;
s edthem: greatly numerially---two to one, at&#xD;
least,"replied Ridgley. "They are stimulated&#xD;
ly h ehope.of plunder, and will fight better,&#xD;
probably, than Mexicans are wont without this&#xD;
Wwperful incentive. 1 had hoped that since the&#xD;
decisive affair of San Jacinto, we should have&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
N BRAVQ.&#xD;
peace ; but it would seem. that we are doomed&#xD;
to disappointment. We have now to deal with&#xD;
what appears a lawless banditti, having no other&#xD;
aim than bloodshed and indiscriminate plun.&#xD;
der."&#xD;
" We must trust in the Rangers, my dear&#xD;
uncle," said Andrea.&#xD;
"And in God," added Ridgley, solemnly.&#xD;
"Was it not.stipulated by Santa Anna, that&#xD;
all his forces should withdraw to the west side&#xD;
of the Rio Grande !" asked Rosalia.&#xD;
"It was ; and the promise has been in a&#xD;
measure fulfilled ; but those who are now -boy.&#xD;
ering about Bexar, like hungry wolves, care&#xD;
little for stipulations and :agreements ; - they&#xD;
know no law but their own wills. They respect&#xD;
no governments, ither human or divine, and&#xD;
their masters are their own unrestrained desires,&#xD;
If they would come out and attack us boldly,'&#xD;
we should fear them but little, and have no&#xD;
great difficulty in defending our own ; butthey&#xD;
will watch their time -and fall upon us like'&#xD;
thieves in the night,"&#xD;
" Is the danger then so great ?" continued&#xD;
Rosalia.&#xD;
" I would not alarm you unnecessarily, but&#xD;
leave you to draw your own inferences from&#xD;
what I have stated."&#xD;
Soon after-this conversation the family retired,&#xD;
each unusually thoughtful, and anxious for the&#xD;
future.-&#xD;
&#xD;
WALTER ETHINGTON was consider-&#xD;
ably surprised when Felix returned and&#xD;
related his adventure with Wikoff and Cogs-&#xD;
well, whom he described as accurately as possi-&#xD;
ble; and our hero was not much at a loss to&#xD;
determine who they were, and the object they-&#xD;
had in view. Some portion of Walter's mis-&#xD;
anthroiy had worn off, and he was heartily glad&#xD;
that his'faithful friend had escaped so well. He&#xD;
strongly advised him to be careful in his future&#xD;
walks, always to go armed, and never venture&#xD;
out of sight of the camp. He requested Felix&#xD;
to relate the affair to Captain Wilson, and both&#xD;
agreed that Cogswell and Wikoff must have&#xD;
been the parties concerned, and that some mis-&#xD;
chief was evidently in progress, which it was&#xD;
their duty to guard against by every rational&#xD;
means.&#xD;
"Both, of them have sought to take our&#xD;
lives," said Wilson, "in an underhanded and&#xD;
unmanly way.   Cogswell was, no doubt, the&#xD;
unseen marksman who wounded me. after 'the&#xD;
battle of San Jacinto, and Wikoff acted the&#xD;
coward and the assassin by firing before the&#xD;
&#xD;
word was given; a circumstance which canhe&#xD;
near proving fatal to you. I do not believethe&#xD;
story of his being a successful rival.-If his&#xD;
suit had prospered with Andrea St. ;Aubert,&#xD;
why should he be here, and -why wish to destroy&#xD;
you?   Depend upon it, he is - a :disappointed&#xD;
man ; for success does not. produce revengeful&#xD;
feelings. Look at the case of Cogswell;Marl-&#xD;
anna did not favor him so much as she didtame.&#xD;
He perceived that he was losing ground, and&#xD;
that I was rising in the esteem of Marianna in&#xD;
proportion.  You know   the result; be, has&#xD;
sought my life ever since with as much zeal iS&#xD;
Saul sought the life of Iavid. Now'these~t o&#xD;
fellows- Cogswell and Wikoff-are equally&#xD;
mated-; they are both consummate villains, and&#xD;
it is our duty to keep our eyes open and not let&#xD;
them have it all their own way."&#xD;
"I coincide with you in much that you have&#xD;
saidd" replied Walter.&#xD;
" It's my settled conviction," added Wilson,&#xD;
"that this person who calls himself, Wikeff, is&#xD;
the cause of all your. misfortunes  IfEtime&#xD;
proves mehwrong, then I will give up 411elainis&#xD;

" You mean well, Captain Wilson," answered&#xD;
Ethington, but he added with a faint smile, and&#xD;
extending his hand to the captain, " we will&#xD;
continue the subject at another time."&#xD;
" Felix," said the latter, when Ethington had&#xD;
walked away.&#xD;
" Here's dis nigger," said Felix.&#xD;
" Do you know what caused this fatal mis-&#xD;
understanding between your master and Miss&#xD;
St. Aubert ?""&#xD;
"Yes, sare, I do'sen't know," replied Felix,&#xD;
gravely.&#xD;
"I like your master, Felix, and wish to make&#xD;
him more happy, if possible. If you know&#xD;
anything about this affair, don't be afraid to tell&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"'Twouldn't be safe, massa cap'en."&#xD;
"Nonsense, speak out."&#xD;
"He cotched her walking in de garden wid&#xD;

"Well, go on, Felix."&#xD;

"You're a great nigger, Felix," added the&#xD;
captain, good naturedly.  "You're worth your&#xD;
weight in gold."&#xD;
"'Go it, massa Kentuck, promulgate, 'spress&#xD;
your phelinx, heah, heah ! " and Felix left the&#xD;
'captain, not a little flattered by his off-hand&#xD;
etoirgh rather dubious compliments.&#xD;
The Texan Rangers were encamped but a&#xD;
short distance from San Antonio, and late on&#xD;
the evening of the following day Ethington&#xD;
talked into the town. As he passed from&#xD;
street to street, his thoughts recurred. to thtg&#xD;
pst, note especially to his recent adventures in&#xD;
the land5of the'" Lone Star," bis various extra-&#xD;
erdin'ary escapes, and the kindness.which he had&#xD;
~received on several occasions frord strangers.&#xD;
&#xD;
48&#xD;
&#xD;
pensive character of his meditations soon had&#xD;
their effect, and in a little time Walter was in&#xD;
the misty land of dreams.&#xD;
He was awakened at length by the discharge&#xD;
of fire-arms, and loud and continued shouting.&#xD;
He sprang to his feet, at a loss, for a moment,&#xD;
to account for what he heard';.-then the sharp&#xD;
crack of the Texan rifles reached his ears, and&#xD;
he divined at once that the town had been at-&#xD;
tacked by Mexican banditti.&#xD;
The confusion, and firing, and outcries,:rapid-&#xD;
&#xD;
again together."&#xD;
Heavy, hurried steps were now heard upon&#xD;
the stairs, and Ridgley'dashed into the chamber,&#xD;
considerably excited, and judging from his dis-&#xD;
ordered dress, fresh from a scuffle of some kind.&#xD;
He paused suddenly when he beheld Ethingtpn&#xD;
and seemed confounded.&#xD;
Our hero was the first to recover himself.&#xD;
"Ibelieve I was in time to be of some service&#xD;
to this young lady," he stammered.  "What&#xD;
means this confusion?  What has happened ?"&#xD;
he asked, still confused and-embarrassed, and&#xD;
&#xD;

who, with the former, had watched over him     ton hurried towards the scene of tumult. In&#xD;
in hours of pain and unconsciousness.          leaving the camp he had not neglected to take&#xD;

nature to the employments of the other sex than saw lights flashing from the windows, heard&#xD;
those of his own.                               voices, and the sound of rapid footsteps within.&#xD;
The reason of this will be more apparent       To run through the open gate and enter the&#xD;

placing Miss St. Aubert, who now 'showed signs&#xD;
of returning animation, in an easy chair.&#xD;
"I thank you in the name of Andrea," re-.&#xD;
plied Ridgley. "Where is Rosalia ?"&#xD;
"I have seen no other female," said Ething-&#xD;
ton. At that instant there was a great crash&#xD;
in the next room. Ridgley caught the -lamp&#xD;
from the table and ran in. The cause of the&#xD;
noise was soon discovered; the man whom Wal.&#xD;
ter had knocked down, had recovered his sense'&#xD;
and made his escape by leaping through tle&#xD;
window. Rosalia had fainted at the moment of&#xD;
Walter's appearance, and was found in the&#xD;
apartment unharmed, though very much terrified.&#xD;
Sheregained her courage instantly upon seeing&#xD;
her father, and hastened to minister to Andrea..&#xD;
"The danger has passed, I believe, of what.&#xD;
ever nature it might have been," said the young,&#xD;
man.   "I hear the sound of conflict near us,&#xD;
and I will therefore hasten to join my brave eome&#xD;
panions."&#xD;
"Our house has been assailed by rnmans,"&#xD;
replied Ridgley.  "You have rendered me an,&#xD;
important service, which I shall be sure to;rep&#xD;
member. The object of this attack I seaicel f&#xD;
know, for I have not yet had time to olleet' r&#xD;
thoughts."&#xD;
Without trusting himself to look in oat&#xD;
Andrea, Ethington descended' the stair. The&#xD;
door was still open as he had found it, but upon&#xD;
the steps lay the body of a man, apparently&#xD;
dead. Walter bent over him, looked at the&#xD;
face, and felt quite sure that it was Wikeff;, but&#xD;
wishing to be quite certain of his identity, he&#xD;
entered the parlor where a lamp was burning,&#xD;
and returning with it, examined the features.&#xD;
He was correct in his first impressions; it&#xD;
was indeed Wikoff. One hand lay across his&#xD;
breast, and upon the fourth finger sparkled a&#xD;
ring with upcommon brilliancy, as the rays. Hof&#xD;
the lamp fell upon it. Ethington could not re-&#xD;
press an exclamation of surprise, as his eyes&#xD;
rested upon the ornament, for he recognized it ;&#xD;
he A-kpce given it to Miss St. Aubert. .,ow&#xD;

Wikof's chest heaved convulsively, and he&#xD;
gave signs ofreturning'life. Walter dashed the&#xD;
lanip upon the ground with a muttered impre-&#xD;
cation, and with a frowning brow walked hastily&#xD;
from the spot.&#xD;

'4"o thespot where the firing and shouting were&#xD;
Niitheard. He wt s soon among- the combat-&#xD;
ani, fighting with atl his accustomed daring&#xD;
and bravery.&#xD;
Suddenly he was prostrated by a blow upon&#xD;
the head  He knew no mire of the fight-he&#xD;
head no longer theloud ringing"voice of Wilson,&#xD;
orthe crack of the Texan rifles. It was broad&#xD;
. d  i  before he was again conscious, of exis-&#xD;
Stei~aig e found himself lying on the ground,&#xD;
boun ,ain aand foot. Around him lay several&#xD;
Mdicans wrapped in their blankets, sleeping.&#xD;
He attempted to arise to a . sitting posture, but&#xD;
could not.  The bands upon his wrists gave&#xD;
him intense pain, and he' felt very faint and&#xD;
miserable. He reconnoitered:the spot as well as&#xD;
he ould in a horizontal position, and perceived&#xD;
that they were surrounded on-all sides by a dense&#xD;
chapareL  At' a short distance was a tent,&#xD;
and judging bf the sounds that occasionally&#xD;
cam&amp;amp; from it; Ethington concluded th    n-&#xD;
Staied= wounded men.&#xD;
&#xD;
Though suffering much pain, our hero was:&#xD;
forced, to lie unnoticed for two hours, when-a&#xD;
man came from the tent and' approached ,him.&#xD;
He was not a little astonished at seeing the in-&#xD;
dividual who now stood beside him, for in him&#xD;
he recognized Cogswell, the lover of Marianna&#xD;
Lee. He was industriously smoking a cigarillo,&#xD;
and contemplated the prostrate figure of our&#xD;
hero with the cahmest satisfaction.&#xD;
Ethington asked him to loosen the cords a&#xD;
little, as his limbs were now considerably swol-&#xD;
len ; but Cogswell declined to comply with this&#xD;
reasonable request, assuring him that if he were&#xD;
to do anything in the premises, he should' make-&#xD;
his bands tighter.&#xD;
"Miserable renegade !" exclaimed Ething.&#xD;
ton, indignantly. " I should have known that&#xD;
a creature who will fight against his country-&#xD;
men, will not show common humanity towards&#xD;
a fellow-being,"&#xD;
"Here comes a gentleman who will doubtless&#xD;
entertain you more agreeably than I can," re-&#xD;
plied Cogswell, with a malicious sneer.&#xD;
Ethington turned his eyes with difficulty to-&#xD;
wards the person indicated, and saw his antago-&#xD;
nist in the late duel at' San Jacinto. His head&#xD;
was bound up with a handkerchief, and he was&#xD;
deadly pale from loss of blood.&#xD;
"Well, sir, you are not with the Rangers&#xD;
now !" said Wikoff.&#xD;
" It is quite unnecessary to inform me of that&#xD;
fact," replied Ethington.  "It is very evident&#xD;
that I am not among men of honor."&#xD;
" Did you ever'see this ring before ?" asked'&#xD;
Wikoff, holding up his finger.&#xD;
"I saw you lying -senseless upon the ground&#xD;
last night," retorted Walter.  "' You were in:&#xD;
my power, but I 'scorned 'to take advantage of'&#xD;
your helpless-condition."  '&#xD;
"You were very humane," rejoined Wikoff,&#xD;
changing color.  " But what do you say of this':&#xD;
ring ?"&#xD;
" Perhaps , you  purloined it;' I  d anot  know  ;&#xD;
a man without honor is capable of any meanness&#xD;
&#xD;
if Miss St. Aubert bestowed it upon you, she&#xD;
was certainly very unfortunate in the-choice of&#xD;
a friend.  But you have yet to explain the&#xD;
cause of being found: insensible upon the door&#xD;
steps of the house where the lady resides."&#xD;
"That has little to do with our present busi-&#xD;
ness. Suffice- it that you have always been- in&#xD;
my way, and were so last night ; but it shall&#xD;
soon be beyond your power to mar my plans or&#xD;
baffle my purposes. Look up at the sun; it&#xD;
never shone more brilliantly ; gaze your fill and&#xD;
say ' farewell;" for you will never see it rise&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"Dare you then lift your hand against my&#xD;
life ?"&#xD;
"The 'Texan Bravo' shrinks from   the or-&#xD;
deal! I thought it was death that he was seek-&#xD;
ing?"&#xD;
"I fear not death, when met honorably ; but&#xD;
I never sought it at the hands of a villain who&#xD;
would make my demise the means of carrying&#xD;
out his nefarious schemes, and bringing down\&#xD;
ruin upon others. I can die like a man,; but&#xD;
remember that the Texan rifles will avenge my&#xD;
death.  Perhaps you never saw one of the Ran-&#xD;
gers look through the double sights ?"&#xD;
Wikoff grew a shade paler, and Cogswell&#xD;
shrugged 'his shoulders significantly at the men-&#xD;
tion f the " double sights."  Both knew'the&#xD;
fatal' significance of the words, for the sharp&#xD;
shooting of the Rarfgers was proverbial; and it&#xD;
is a well known fact that great numbers of the&#xD;
enemy who were left on the field in various bat-&#xD;
ties were shot through the head.*&#xD;
Wikoff and Cogswell now walked away to-&#xD;
gether, while one of the Mexicans, more humane&#xD;
than they, loosened' the cords about his limbs,&#xD;
which gave him great relief. Presently there&#xD;
* General Green, in his history of'the Mier expedi-&#xD;
tion, informs us that after the battle of Mier he visited&#xD;
the building where the wounded of the enemy were&#xD;
inder surgical treatment. He says: "One hundred&#xD;
aid thirty-six of the enemy's wounded were stretched&#xD;
out on the floor, many of whom had been shot in the&#xD;
head, and their brains had oozed out, from the size of&#xD;
a marble to that of one's fist. It was a horrible sight."&#xD;
&#xD;
was considerable bustle in the camp. The sol.&#xD;
diers (if we may thus call them)were got utder'&#xD;
arms by their leader, the identical Captain Gar-&#xD;
cia, who had led an attack against Ethington&#xD;
and his two friends on the Colorado.&#xD;
Our hero's feet were now set at liberty, and&#xD;
he was marched out in front of the marshall&#xD;
band by a file, f' men. Ethington understood&amp;amp;&#xD;
these preparations well; it was evident thathe&#xD;
was about to be shot, and he endeavored to com-&#xD;
pose his mind, and fix his last earthly thoughts&#xD;
on the only Being who could now assist ad sus-&#xD;
tam him.&#xD;
In the brief space that was allowed hi  r&#xD;
meditation, he reflected upon the stormy events&#xD;
that had been crowded into his life since he had&#xD;
left his native State, a reckless and hopeless&#xD;
man. As he could discern in the portents of&#xD;
the future no brightening of the sun of his des-&#xD;
tiny, he resigned himself to his fate without a&#xD;
murmur. Although existence had no charms&#xD;
for him, and he had often sought death, yet he&#xD;
could not but feel and confess to himself that he&#xD;
was not wholly prepared for the great change&#xD;
which awaited him.&#xD;
The near prospect of dissolution brought&#xD;
with it clearer views of man and his duties. He&#xD;
began to doubt whether misanthropy was not t&#xD;
crime in the sight of God, and if the last few&#xD;
months of his life had not been sinful in the ex-&#xD;
treme. But there was now little opportunity to&#xD;
discuss such questions; he stood face to face&#xD;
with those selected to be his exeeutioners--a&#xD;
band of lawless and savage-looking fellows, ap-&#xD;
parently dead to all the finer susceptibilities of&#xD;
human nature.&#xD;
A man now came forward with a handker-&#xD;
chief to bandage his eyes, but Ethington shook&#xD;
his head, saying proudly:&#xD;
I-have often faced death, and' I am no-&#xD;
afraid to face it once more. It is the coward&#xD;
soul alone that shrinks from beholding the ter&#xD;
rors of death."&#xD;
"Proud to the last," murmured Wikoff, who&#xD;

measure, and does not mean to falter in its en-&#xD;
cution.&#xD;
His features never looked more repulsive and&#xD;
forbidding to Marianna, and she heartily wished&#xD;
the interview at an end. She was about to edl&#xD;
her mother, when her quondam lover requested&#xD;
her to be seated and hear what he had to com-&#xD;
municate. She reluctantly complied, and Cows.&#xD;
well mustered all his eloquence and ingenuity to&#xD;
make a final impression upon her heart. Vain&#xD;
attempt ! useless expenditure of words!&#xD;
"You have long known, Miss Lee," he be&#xD;
gan, " that I have ventured to raise my thouglits&#xD;
to you, and to come to the point at once, that I&#xD;
entertain a sincere affection for you; I have&#xD;
now called to hear, from your own lips, the de.&#xD;
vision 'of my'fate. To be brief and plain-for 1&#xD;
am a man of few words-will you become 1%s.&#xD;
Cogswell?"&#xD;
"To be brief and plain, I decline," replied&#xD;
Marianna, firmly.&#xD;
"May I ask your reasons ?" continued Cogs.&#xD;
well, with assumed calmness.&#xD;
&#xD;
W        E will now return to Marianna, whom&#xD;
we shall find comfortably domiciled at&#xD;
San Antonio de Bexar, Mr.. Lee having dispos-&#xD;
ed of his property at San Jacinto, and removed&#xD;
to a small estate which he owned at the place&#xD;
we have mentioned. Marianna rejoiced at this&#xD;
change of residence for several reasons ; and one&#xD;
of the most prominent was, that she' hoped to&#xD;
escape the society of Cogswell, whom she dis-&#xD;
liked and feared.&#xD;
It was the evening of the day upon which&#xD;
Wikoff and Cogswell met for the first time.&#xD;
Marianna Lee was the sole occupant of a small&#xD;
apartment fronting upon the street, while the'&#xD;
other members of the household were either not&#xD;
within doors, or busy in another part of the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
There was a heavy tread upon the steps, and&#xD;
soon a gentle knock upon the door. Marianna&#xD;
hastened to answer the summons, and met Cogs-&#xD;
well upon the threshold. The -blood forsook&#xD;
her cheeks, her heart beat' faster, and it was&#xD;
with difficulty that she could restrain her emo-&#xD;

54               THE TEXAN BRAVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
"There are many, Mr. Cogswell-Ineed not&#xD;
enumerate them-spare me that task, suffice it v&#xD;
that there is a want, of congeniality of dis-&#xD;
position and temperament," said Marianna, in as t&#xD;
gentle a manner as possible.&#xD;
" Could not that objection be overcome-be h&#xD;
melted away by time ?"p&#xD;
"I think not; I can extend no such hope ;&#xD;
it were wrong to do so."                    e&#xD;
"I can well guess-the cause," said Cogswell,&#xD;
with much bitterness. " It is because I have f&#xD;
a rival.  Captain Wilson has stolen away the'&#xD;
regard which you once entertained for me ; and r&#xD;
your blushes are my witnesses that I speak the&#xD;
truth." &#xD;
"The person you have named never injured&#xD;
you in my estimation,'' returned Marianna,c&#xD;
with some asperity of manner.  " I regret to bej&#xD;
forced to tell you that I never entertained any&#xD;
deeper sentiments of friendship for you than I 1&#xD;
now do."&#xD;
'"And that is saying but little, I suppose !"F&#xD;
he retorted, giving his fair auditor a searching&#xD;
t" You are right, sir. There is no reciprocity&#xD;
between us. - I should niot make choice of one&#xD;
like  yog for a friend, much less for a lover.  Do&#xD;
tiot be offended ; you have wrung this confession&#xD;
from 'ni' Learn wisdom; when a maiden says&#xD;
nay,' do not' press her farther, that you iay&#xD;
enjoy some portion of her respect, if not her&#xD;
love. "This subject, I now hope, is put to rest&#xD;
'forever, and.you will do ine a kindness never to&#xD;
dude to it again, in any manner."&#xD;
"You deceive yourself, Miss Lee ; you have&#xD;
mistaken my character ; your perversity does&#xD;
not discourage me. It is time that you should&#xD;
know me better; if you cannot love me, I will&#xD;
atleast teach you to fear me. I have a power&#xD;
odvr you and 'your lover which you do not&#xD;
dream of."&#xD;
"'And do you threaten 'those who find it im-&#xD;
possible to love you ?" exclaimed Marianna,&#xD;
with dignity.&#xD;
"I was saying that I had power over your&#xD;
1friAes' which you do not know of,' or compre-&#xD;
hend," he added, knitting hiis 'bi-ows;.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And if you have this power you speak of,&#xD;
will you use it against a.youthful maiden ?"&#xD;
"I will! I call heaven and earth to witness&#xD;
hat I will !" cried Cogswell, angrily.  "You&#xD;
latter yourself, like others, that you are safe&#xD;
here ; that the Texan Rangers can defend the&#xD;
lace against the attacks of the enemy."&#xD;
"Banditti, you should have said," interrupt-&#xD;
d Marianna.&#xD;
" Call them what you will, I care not ; the&#xD;
act stands the same. The- destruction of San&#xD;
Antonio de Bexar is decided upon ; before&#xD;
many days it will be a heap of steaming ruins."&#xD;
If anything were wanting," retorted Marian-&#xD;
na, with burning cheeks and flashing eyes, " to&#xD;
make me regard you with deeper loathing and&#xD;
contempt, it was what you have now uttered.&#xD;
Above all living things I despise a traitor !"&#xD;
" That is bitter language," said Cogswell,&#xD;
biting his lips.&#xD;
" Let us part now; relieve me of your pres-&#xD;
ence, I beg of you," responded the ' maiden,&#xD;
rising.&#xD;
"Hear me out."&#xD;
"No, I had rather see you out."&#xD;
"You are witty at my expense ; but my turn&#xD;
will come anon. Who will be your protector&#xD;
when Bexar is wrapped in flames, and its streets&#xD;
are full of blood-thirsty men, to pillage and&#xD;
destroy ?"&#xD;
"I pray Heaven I may not be so much de-&#xD;
serted by God as to accept protection from' a&#xD;
traitor. I would sooner share the fate ofthe&#xD;
Alamo,". said Marianna, with spirit.&#xD;
" Listen ! Just beyond the Rio-Grande is a&#xD;
beautiful rancho, of which I am to be master.&#xD;
You have only to say a word to be its mistress,&#xD;
and San Antonio shall not be harmed. And&#xD;
more than this-Wilson's life shall be spared."&#xD;
" Go, sir ! I will make no terms. If all&#xD;
your allies are like yourself, San Antonio will&#xD;
never be conquered. As for Captain Wilson,&#xD;
if he cannot defend himself and maintain his&#xD;
position, it will be because he has forgotten San&#xD;
Jacinto. "&#xD;
" I perceive that you love to talk of San Jar&#xD;
cinto; it gives you pleasure. But remember&#xD;
&#xD;
my words-the time draws near-San Antonio&#xD;
will burn-will become a heap .of ashes-and&#xD;
the Rangers shall be swept away with the besom&#xD;
of destruction. Reflect one instant ; will you&#xD;
prevent this awful calamity ?"&#xD;
"Shall I light you out, or will you force me&#xD;
to speak to my father?"&#xD;
Cogswell trembled with rage, and with a mut-&#xD;
tered curse and -a frowning brow,. prepared. to&#xD;
depart. He paused a moment on the steps,,&#xD;
and darting a threatening look at Mariaina,&#xD;
exclaimed :&#xD;
You shall regret this insult ; my words are&#xD;
prophetic. I will make them true. Bexar shall&#xD;
burn, and--"&#xD;
Marianna closed the door and did not hear the&#xD;
conclusion of the sentence, though she could&#xD;
well guess its import. She retired to-her cham-&#xD;
ber, feeling truly wretched,- and gave way to her&#xD;
emotions without restraint.  That: she feared&#xD;
Cogswell, she could not deny ; and his threats&#xD;
had terrified her greatly, in addition to the re-&#xD;
pugnance she had always felt towards him.&#xD;
Soon after Walter Ethington's departure from&#xD;
camp, Captain Wilson gave orders to Lieuten-&#xD;
ant Cameron (a tried officer and soldier who&#xD;
had shared the dangers of various battles) to&#xD;
double the guard and take other precautions, as&#xD;
he had reason to believe that an attack upon the&#xD;
town was meditated by a band of the enemy that&#xD;
had been seen upon the west bank of the Nueces.&#xD;
Having given the lieutenant such instructions as&#xD;
he thought necessary, he called. Felix, and pro-&#xD;
ceeded towards San Antonio.&#xD;
"Now, Felix," said Wilson.&#xD;
Open your ears and hear what I am going&#xD;
to say," added the captain.     -   -&#xD;
" Locomote yer sentements-'luminate de&#xD;
natur ob de subjeck," responded Felix.&#xD;
"You see I am going into the town ?"&#xD;
"I know what for, massa ?"&#xD;
" Name it, you colored specimen."&#xD;
"He, he ! keep- cool, massa Kentuck ; don't&#xD;
go for to bein' hard on dis nigger feller ; you're&#xD;
a gwine up to see dat harnsum white gal; heah,&#xD;
heahl"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Right, Felix, for once in your life."&#xD;
"Don't blame ye, massa ; I used to-go to&#xD;
see a white gal once."&#xD;
Y'ou?"&#xD;
Ob course.&#xD;
"Come, Felix, be careful,"&#xD;
Yes, sare."&#xD;
"Do you see this rifle?"&#xD;
Does I see dat rifle?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
Ob course I does."&#xD;
"Well, take it, and I will tell you what I&#xD;
want you to do with it.&#xD;
" Splanify . de natur ob de case, massa&#xD;
cap'en."&#xD;
Wilson walked on a little while in silence,&#xD;
while Felix followed close at his heels.&#xD;
"Now," he resumed, stopping just within the&#xD;
town, "I want you to stand here with the rifle,&#xD;
and if you hear any disturbance, or see anything&#xD;
that looks like an attack from the.enemy; fire,&#xD;
and then run to the camp as fast as. you can,&#xD;
and turn out the Rangers..}&#xD;
"Yes, sare. I'll give ye a tall speciment ob&#xD;
runnin' ; I'se good at dat."&#xD;
." I've no doubt but you will do the running .&#xD;
part well; but you must tell Lieutenant Came-&#xD;
ron what you have seen as soon as you reach&#xD;
camp."&#xD;
"Well, what'll dat be ?"&#xD;
"Why, you rascal ! your skull wants',rasp-&#xD;
ing down. How should I know what you will&#xD;
see or hear?  It may be one thing, or it may&#xD;
be another, and perhaps just nothing at all."&#xD;
"Dat' 'luminates de cocoe ob dis nigger; I&#xD;
magnify's de hole at a glance. But wouldn't&#xD;
it be safer not to fire till I get to de camp ?"&#xD;
" Snappin' turtles, and Kentucky alligators i"&#xD;
cried the captain; "your head is bullet proof.&#xD;
It might be safer for you, but not for me."&#xD;
" You can't be safe wid dat Miss Marianna,-&#xD;
no how ; dem bright eyes ob hers will' do de&#xD;

With a good-natured laugh the honest Ken-&#xD;
tuckian repeated his injunctions and walked on;-&#xD;

&#xD;
in a fewinutes he found'himself blushing be-&#xD;
neath the battery of Marianna's eyes. - Before&#xD;
leaving camp, he had deliberately, resolved to&#xD;
speak to her in relation to the subject nearest&#xD;
his heart, but now that he was face to face with&#xD;
her, he was unable to say a word regarding the&#xD;
matter uppermost in his-mind.&#xD;
Marianna received him with uncommon kind-&#xD;
ness, and after some preliminary remarks and&#xD;
many blushes, she proceeded to relate what had&#xD;
passed between Cogswell and herself; repeating&#xD;
in detail, so  as she could recollect, all hehad&#xD;
threatened con   ing the destruction of Bexar.&#xD;
Captain 'Wilson ''tened with breathless at-&#xD;
tention and rising indi ation.&#xD;
"It appears, then," s''d the latter, "that&#xD;
he has joined the band of Me 'can outlaws that&#xD;
is hovering about the Nueces rive . His threats&#xD;
are by no means idle, and no doubt he intends&#xD;
to do all he has spoken of. I thank you sin-&#xD;
cerely for the confidence you have reposed in&#xD;
me, and it affords me inexpressible pleasure to&#xD;
have the means of protecting you in my power ;&#xD;
also to feel assured that you have no-no-"&#xD;
" No what ?" asked Marianna, innocently.&#xD;
" No friendship.for a man capable of such&#xD;
baseness," he added, greatly embarrassed.&#xD;
"I always feared him, and      instinctively&#xD;
shrank from him.   But tell me if you really&#xD;
think Bexarin danger ?'"&#xD;
"Bexar can never be taken," said the cap-&#xD;
tain, earnestly, " while half a dozen Texan&#xD;
Rangers live to 'look through the - double&#xD;
sights.'* Rest assured that when Cogswell&#xD;
marshalls his forces about the dwelling whose&#xD;
roof covers Marianna Lee, that we shall be&#xD;
near."&#xD;
The captain spoke enthusiastically, and was&#xD;
repaid by a timid yet grateful look from the&#xD;
maiden     .&#xD;
"Our foes are cowards," he resumed. "They&#xD;
turn:pale when they hear the report of a Texan&#xD;
rifle.  They.know.that we are devoid of fear,&#xD;

threshold, no matter if he be followed by an&#xD;

ignobly, or retire baffled, and burning with&#xD;
mortification."..&#xD;
Your bold , words   re-assure  me,"  said&#xD;
Marianna.&#xD;
r " If I dared," added Wilson, desperately,&#xD;
" to say what--what-"&#xD;
" You have said what twice, captain," re-&#xD;
marked Marianna, demurely. " Shall I call&#xD;
brother James ?"&#xD;
"No-yes-by all means-certainly not,"&#xD;
stammered the captain, dreadfully embarrassed,&#xD;
and an awkward silence ensued.    4&#xD;
" I had thought," resumed Wilson at length,&#xD;
and then quite broke down; and Marianna was&#xD;
so much confused herself, that she lost her&#xD;
presence of mind and could not say a word.&#xD;
The captain choked and went on again.&#xD;
" I can face an enemy," he said; and stuck&#xD;
again.&#xD;
" Certainly," murmured Marianna, who now&#xD;
really felt called upon to 'say something.&#xD;
S"I can face an enemy, but find it impossible&#xD;
to say-that is, to express, what I would like to&#xD;
on all occasions," added Wilson, with an effort&#xD;
such as a drowning man makes to catch at a&#xD;
straw.&#xD;
Marianna was now trembling and blushing&#xD;
very much, and still trying to look 'perfectly&#xD;
unmoved. and composed.&#xD;
"I thought James would return before this&#xD;
tune," she managed to articulate.&#xD;
Mariannar-" continued the captain.&#xD;
"Yes-" said the maiden.&#xD;
"Did you say yes ?" he added, wiping the&#xD;
cold perspiration from his forehead.&#xD;
" Yes," said Marianna.    =&#xD;
"Is it possible that I am  so happy as to&#xD;
be-&#xD;
" What ?" asked the maiden, dropping hers&#xD;
embroidery and scarcely knowing where she&#xD;
was, or' who she was.&#xD;
"Aliaors and Kentucky      losses .  ex-&#xD;
claimed Wilson, frantically. " I'm a blunder-&#xD;
ing schoolboy. The fact is, I love you."&#xD;
&#xD;

"Dear me !" said Marianna, striving to hide&#xD;
her confusion.&#xD;
"Yes, dear you," answered   the captain,&#xD;
turning from red to pale, and from pale to red&#xD;
in an incredibly short space of time, and taking&#xD;
her hand very cautiously and respectfully.&#xD;
Marianna burst into tears,. and felt that her&#xD;
heart was beating very fast, and that her cheeks&#xD;
must be dreadfully crimsoned, especially after,&#xD;
the captain was so bold as .to draw her towards&#xD;
him, and-, but for her sake we will not'&#xD;
finish the sentence.&#xD;
The " ice," as the saying is, was now-"bro-&#xD;
ken," and a mutual understanding seemed to be&#xD;
speedily brought about. If Marianna trembled&#xD;
and wept, it was not because=she waspunhappy;&#xD;
while the captain was filled with wonder at- the&#xD;
progress he had made, and was ready to believe&#xD;
that he was at camp asleep and dreaming pro-&#xD;
foundly. He had just begun to think there was&#xD;
some foundation in his dreams, when -Mr. Lee&#xD;
and James appeared ; a' circumstance, which,:&#xD;
however agreeable it might have been at any&#xD;
other time, certainly did not wholly harmonize&#xD;
with his feelings now..&#xD;
Beside, his extreme modesty and bashfulness&#xD;
left him still in doubt as to the state of Marian-&#xD;
na's affections . What would have seemed am-&#xD;
ply sufficient to a more experienced man in love&#xD;
matters, appeared enigmatical and of dubious.&#xD;
meaning to him ; though on the whole he felt-&#xD;
very well satisfied thlit he was getting along&#xD;
so finely ; and we presume the discerning&#xD;
reader is pretty much;of the same opinion:&#xD;
Other subjects were now'discussed by the&#xD;
new-corners, and the threats which Cogswell 'had&#xD;
made against the peace ,and safety of San Anto-.&#xD;
nio de Bexar was fully talked over. By this&#xD;
time the ' captain had forgotten Felix, and- the&#xD;
solitary vigil he was keeping. The moments&#xD;
winged themselves rapidly away, and the small&#xD;
hours of the night approached.&#xD;
Suddenly there was the crack of a rifle that&#xD;
reverberated sharply from street to street ; and&#xD;
brought the captain to his feet, as though he&#xD;
had received a powerful shock from a galvanic&#xD;
battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
N BRAVO.                                57&#xD;
"Bring out your weapons I" he exclaimed ;&#xD;
there is danger near ; perhaps the town is&#xD;
attacked."&#xD;
Marianna's cheek grew pale, and she thought&#xD;
of Cogswell's threats. The captain's trepida-&#xD;
tions vanished at once. The sound of the rifle&#xD;
and the prospect of a fight, aroused all his war-&#xD;
like blood and quickened his energies. He&#xD;
could now speak firmly and calmly, and express&#xD;
his wishes without difficulty. The bright eye&#xD;
of a niaiden might abash him, but from the eye&#xD;
of an enemy he never shrank.&#xD;
"Hark !" he exclaimed.    "I hear the&#xD;
tread of 'armed men ; they approach the house.&#xD;
Hand me out one of those rifles. Miss Lee, do&#xD;
not fear-keep out of the range of the windows ;&#xD;
extinguish the lights."&#xD;
Wilson stepped to the window the moment&#xD;
the lights were extinguished, and looked outs.&#xD;
The street in front was full of men.&#xD;
The captain fell back and spoke to his two&#xD;
companions in whispers. "There are men in&#xD;
front of the house ; they are preparing to enter ;&#xD;
be ready to give them a volley. Marianna and&#xD;
her mother had better retire to a situation less&#xD;
exposed."&#xD;
They now heard the gate, which gave access&#xD;
to the little yard in front, opened softly. They&#xD;
were obviously meditating a surprise.&#xD;
Young Lee was no longer able to curb his&#xD;
curiosity; and followed Wilson's example of re-&#xD;
connoitering from the window. He. laid his&#xD;
hand nervously upon the captain's arm, saying&#xD;
in a voice not above his breath:&#xD;
"I see a figure that resembles Cogswell.&#xD;
And look ! those with' him are Mexicans. I&#xD;
know them by their jaunty rig, an  '    r&#xD;
if by no other means. Cogswell is disposed to&#xD;
keep rather in the back ground, and pnt his&#xD;
fellows forward.R&#xD;
"ie's a coward," said Wilson.&#xD;
"Do you know what I think he's here for;&#xD;
with those ugly chaps ?"&#xD;
" I don't," replied, the captain.&#xD;
" I will tell you; 'tis to carry off Marian-'&#xD;
" Do you think he will do it ?" asked the&#xD;
ranger, significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;

"If he does, he'll have to carry off several&#xD;
of us,or settle up our earthly accounts for us,"&#xD;
answered young Lee, firmly.&#xD;
' Can you see' him now7" whispered the&#xD;
captain, looking anxiously forth in the dark.&#xD;
"I can't ; he has stepped back. What does&#xD;
thisdelay mean, I wonder ?"&#xD;
"' Surrounding the house, most likely. Lis-&#xD;
ten! "they are trying the door."&#xD;
he door was shaken gently at first, and&#xD;
smore violently anon, by those without.  The&#xD;
parties within waited long enough for these pre-&#xD;
parations to assume form sufficiently offensive&#xD;
to warrant them in acting on the defensive,&#xD;
when Wilson urged the propriety of firing upon&#xD;
them. His companions were not averse to this&#xD;
proposition, for James had been anxious to look&#xD;
thiroigh the sights for the last five minutes. -&#xD;
" You see a cluster of fellows there by the&#xD;
gate'?" said the ranger.&#xD;
"Yes," said Lee, "and we will thin it&#xD;
out."&#xD;
"A.fine chance for a shot," continued Wil-&#xD;
son ; "let us improve it."&#xD;
The moon whose light had been. hitherto&#xD;
deeply obscured by clouds, now shed a momen-&#xD;
tary gleam upon the swarthy faces of the group,&#xD;
revealing dimly their outlines.  They stood,&#xD;
carelessly leaning upon their escopetas, as if&#xD;
waiting some signal from their companions at&#xD;
the door, not dreaming that their presence was,&#xD;
suspected by the inmates.;&#xD;
"Give ,them your lead!"    whispered thel&#xD;
ranger.&#xD;
The report of three rifles breaking suddenly&#xD;
upon the stillness of the night, and upon the&#xD;
unsuspecting ears of those without, gave a start-&#xD;
ling indication that they were discovered.&#xD;
A sharp cry of pain was heard, a few half-'&#xD;
uttered exclamations and curses, and when the&#xD;
smoke had cleared away, not a Mexican was to&#xD;
be seen ; but very soon there was a A shower of&#xD;
balls against the house, perforating the walls,&#xD;
and shivering the glass, doing no other injury.&#xD;
It was in vain that Wilson strained his eyes&#xD;
to catch a glimpse of the figure of Cogswell; he&#xD;
took good care not to expose his person.&#xD;
&#xD;
LN BRAVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
There was an interval of silence, and a sus-&#xD;
pension of offensive operations on the part of the&#xD;
belligerents ; they were doubtless holding a con-&#xD;
suitation.  But the temporary calm was of short&#xD;
duration ; a general attack upon the dwelling&#xD;
speedily followed, and it was very certain that&#xD;
those within could not long defend it when there&#xD;
was such a disparity of numbers.&#xD;
Doors, windows, and every assailable part was&#xD;
assailed simultaneously.  Lee and his compan-&#xD;
ions fought with heroic courage ; they passed&#xD;
from window to window, dashing back their&#xD;
enemies, and putting forth efforts that seemed&#xD;
well nigh above human capacity.&#xD;
Wilson thought of Marianna, and as he be-&#xD;
held the foe. fast gaining ground, the thought&#xD;
was fraught with unspeakable agony. - She&#xD;
would unquestionably be torn from him, and&#xD;
irrevocably lost to him at the very crisis when he&#xD;
was sure that he had some share in her affec-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
In every-assailant he hoped to meet Cogswell;&#xD;
and grown desperate at length, he loudly called&#xD;
on him and dared him to an encounter ; but&#xD;
there was no response,, and Wilson cursed his&#xD;
cowardice.&#xD;
The enemy were pouring in at the window,&#xD;
and for the first time the bold ranger experienced&#xD;
a feeling of despair. He thought of Cameron,&#xD;
and would have given his right hand to have&#xD;
heard the steady steps of the Texan Rangers.&#xD;
"Where are my brave fellows !" he exclaim-&#xD;
ed.  "What can keep them away so long'?"&#xD;
At that critical juncture, to render the scene&#xD;
more - deplorable, Marianna and her mother&#xD;
rushed into the apartment closely pursued.&#xD;
The ranger threw his arm  about Marianna,&#xD;
and with his good sword defended her bravely,&#xD;
making his own fearless bosom, a bulwark for&#xD;
her defenceless head. The hand that had felt&#xD;
weary but a moment before, was endowed with&#xD;
double energy ; for the gentle being whom he&#xD;
now pressed to his heart had restored all his&#xD;
strength, and fired his daring soul with uncon-&#xD;
querable determination.&#xD;
S" We are lost !" cried Lee, " but we will&#xD;
perish doing our duty."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TEXAN BRAVO.              59&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, we will all die together," said Mrs.&#xD;
Lee. " Our separation will be momentary, our&#xD;
re-union speedy."&#xD;
" Yield !" cried a voice from the mIdle of&#xD;
the assailants; " yield, and we will spare your&#xD;
lives."&#xD;
"'Tis Cogswell!" exclaimed Mrs. Lee.&#xD;
" No, villain ! we will fight it out," replied&#xD;
Lee.  "We will not yield    our defenceless&#xD;
women to you; they prefer to die honorably&#xD;
with us."&#xD;
"Desist !" shouted Cogswell once more;&#xD;
"every moment you endiangerThelives  of those.&#xD;
you love."&#xD;
S"Meet me like a man,"     cried Wilson ;&#xD;
"come forward, and letus decide this matter'&#xD;
face to face.','&#xD;
" Never !" replied Cogswell  "The:affair&#xD;
is already decided.. You are surrounded, and&#xD;
cannot hold your ground three minutealonger..&#xD;
Relinquish your hold upon that girl, whose life&#xD;
you are recklessly exposing, and I will withdraw;&#xD;
my men."&#xD;
The ranger's blood boiled with indignation,&#xD;
and he made desperate efforts to cut his way&#xD;
through the levelled lances to reach Cogswell.&#xD;
Suddenly there .came   sounds that made&#xD;
every heart leap and every ear tingle.  The&#xD;
points of both lance and sword fell to the ground ;&#xD;
for the trumpet tones of Cameron were ringing&#xD;
upon the air.&#xD;
"Forward, my      lads-forward--steady-.&#xD;
now give it to the swarthy d-ls !"&#xD;
The deadly crack of the. Texan rifles fell like&#xD;
sharpest thunder upon the senses of the assail-&#xD;
ants within the dwelling ; they rushed simulta-&#xD;
neously towards doors and windows, struck with&#xD;
a frightful panic ;, and many of them fell pierced&#xD;
with rifle balls while forcing themselves out.&#xD;
"Was there ever sweeter music'?" cried&#xD;
Wilson, as the rifles continued to utter their&#xD;
voices of death.&#xD;
"Never, since the world was made," replied&#xD;
&#xD;
Lee. "Cameron and the Rangers forever!,&#xD;
God bless them !"&#xD;
"Those without are flying," said James.&#xD;
Captain Wilson sprang to the window, still&#xD;
supporting Marianna, and shouting the name of&#xD;
Cameron. The well-known voice of their com-&#xD;
mander reached the ears of the Rangers, and&#xD;
they cheered him to the echo.&#xD;
In an instant Cameron sprang in through a&#xD;
shattered window, and Wilson wrung his hapd&#xD;
in expressive silence ; the hearts of all parties&#xD;
were too full to speak.&#xD;
The dark face of Felix appeared in the win-&#xD;
dow&#xD;
",Go yer death, massa Kentuck !"&#xD;
"All safe, Felix," said the ranger, in a low&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
Where's massa Ethington?"&#xD;
The captain's countenance fell, and he looked&#xD;
inquiringly at Cameron ; the latter shook his&#xD;
head. The African glanced from  one to the&#xD;
other, and his large eyes displayed a frightful&#xD;
quantity of white.&#xD;
f Here's a scrape for dis nigger " he ,ex-&#xD;
claimed. "You'd better all on ye be dead, and&#xD;
dis child better be dead too. Why don't, yer.&#xD;
'luminate de subjeck, some on ye-?"&#xD;
"We can't," said the captain. "I.would&#xD;
most gladly, if I could. I trust he is: safe,&#xD;
however."&#xD;
"I shan't 'spress my idees till I know. sui-&#xD;

ominously.  "But if dis darkey," he added,&#xD;

be ambigerous to de happiness ob dis occasion"&#xD;
Lights were speedily procured,- the dead and&#xD;
wounded removed by the Rangers, and such&#xD;
precautions for the general safety taken ad the&#xD;
ease required. The enemy were completely&#xD;
routed, and the bold Texans had the pleasure of&#xD;
receiving the heartfelt thanks of the people of&#xD;
Bexar, whose homes they had defended.&#xD;

of the fact that Mr. Ethington, the brave gen-&#xD;

"Yes, I -know," replied the youth, " and&#xD;

"I will tell you, my lad, with pleasure. I&#xD;

AexclaimiedAugustus, warmly.   "I knew you&#xD;
were of a bold and chivalrous nature."&#xD;
"Whether that be the case or not, the man&#xD;
whom I am going to seek is the soul of soldiery,&#xD;
the heart of honor; and I will never forsake&#xD;
him; while there is a chance, however' small it&#xD;

"Jossibly it is too late to. if-u' ny essential&#xD;

"dry true.   He has been an object of par.&#xD;

exactly know, and never could find out," ob-&#xD;
served Wilson.&#xD;
"It is to be regretted that he never tried to&#xD;
have the difficulty explained," resumed Au-&#xD;
gustus, thoughtfully.&#xD;
"He did not like to say much about the sub-&#xD;
ject.; and- the fact was, he said it never could&#xD;
be :explained ; but. it 'is my opinion that this&#xD;
same Wikoff had an .agency in the affair," an-&#xD;
swered the captain.&#xD;
" Have you seen Mr. Ridgley, this morning ?"&#xD;
",I have, and he told me of the unwarrant-&#xD;
able attack ort his mansion, and of the service&#xD;
rendered by our mutual friend, Ethington. It&#xD;
appears that Mr. Ridgley is Miss St. Aubert's&#xD;
uncle ?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
' You know her, then ?"&#xD;
"Very well, but not quite so well as I wish&#xD;
I did," said the youth, with a sigh.&#xD;
"Why, my lad, you are not in love with her,&#xD;
are you?"&#xD;
"0, no; but I like her very well when she.&#xD;
pleases me."&#xD;
"Is she handsome ?"&#xD;
"Rosalia thinks she is."&#xD;
" Well,'what do you think ?" .&#xD;
" My opinion isn't worth much on such mat&#xD;
ters ; but I should say that she had a fair share&#xD;
of beauty, though not much more than usually&#xD;
falls to the lot of young ladies.  She has regu-&#xD;
lar features, and Rosalia says a very good figure,&#xD;
but I imagine I could find fault with both."&#xD;
"Rosalia is Mr. Ridgley's daughter ?"-&#xD;
"And consequently my cousin, also."&#xD;
"Well, I hope it will all come right ultimate-&#xD;
ly."&#xD;
"No one desires such an event more sincere-&#xD;
ly than the youth now before you," added&#xD;
HIenrie, sighing.&#xD;
With mutual good wishes the parties sepa-&#xD;
rated, the captain to make the necesssary prepa-&#xD;
rations for pursuing the enemy, and the other&#xD;
to follow the bent of his own fancies, whatever&#xD;
they might be.&#xD;
Cameron and a half-dozen of the boldest and&#xD;
hardiest of the Bangers were 'selected to carry&#xD;
&#xD;
out the object in view, while, the company was&#xD;
left in command of the second lieutenant until&#xD;
they should return.  The captain did .not con-&#xD;
sider it safe to take more men, as the town might&#xD;
be again attacked, when all would be needed in&#xD;
its defence.&#xD;
Well armed, and feling fully prepared for&#xD;
any ,emergency, the little party set off on the&#xD;
expedition, followed by the good wishes of those&#xD;
who remained behind. They crossed the Rio&#xD;
San Miguel, and directed their course towards&#xD;
the Nueces. Felix had joined Wilson and his&#xD;
brave fellows, greatly elated with the prospect,&#xD;
of being ,of anyservice to his master.&#xD;
It was found 'a matter of some difficulty to&#xD;
trace the enemy.  They were obliged to pro-&#xD;
ceed slowly,.and 'with the observance of much&#xD;
caution, to prevent a'surprise by large parties of&#xD;
Mexicans who might be scouring the country in&#xD;
that vicinity. During the first half day's travel,&#xD;
numerous signs of the retreating 'enemy were&#xD;
seen; .but after passing a small tributary of the&#xD;
Rio Frio, they discovered that they were no&#xD;
longer guided by the landmarks that had direct-&#xD;
ed their footsteps previously.&#xD;
The region which they were now entering&#xD;
differed materially from that behind them, being&#xD;
covered with dense chapparel and stunted trees,&#xD;
interspersed;with -fonds and small salt lakes.&#xD;
After spending considerable time to find traces&#xD;
of the"enemy, and tle night approaching, it was&#xD;
thought best tocam iii the neighborhood, and&#xD;
prepare for a more thorough and earnest search&#xD;
upon the following day.&#xD;
Wilson and Cameron stood apart from their&#xD;
companions. With folded arms and thoughtful&#xD;
faces,"they watched the shadows of night steal-&#xD;
ing over lake and chapparel.&#xD;
" An hour like "this casts a spell upon my&#xD;
spirit," said Cameron.  "I love to see    e&#xD;
glare of day fade and give place to the im&#xD;

Cameron made no reply, and the parties re-&#xD;
mained silent. Wilson was the first to speak.&#xD;
" That's a heavy rifle of yours," he said,&#xD;
glancing at the- weapon upon which Cameron&#xD;
was leaning.  "I dare say it has been of ser-&#xD;
lice to you in its time ?"&#xD;
" No money could induce me to part with it,&#xD;
because I 'have proved its metal on many occa-&#xD;
sions. Did I ever tell you of an adventure that&#xD;
I had once.near Red river ?"&#xD;
" You never did ; I should like to hear it,"&#xD;
said Wilson.&#xD;
"Several years ago," resume Cameron, '"I,&#xD;
was hunting near Cross Timbera; not far from'&#xD;
\Red river. -The Indians 'were then 'trouble-&#xD;
soine, and frequently committed their depreda-&#xD;
tions upon the frontier settlements ; but Iwas&#xD;
fond of hunting, and cared little for them, will-&#xD;
ing to trust to my own courage and ingenuity,&#xD;
in any emergency that might occur. I carried&#xD;
this same rifle, and was called ' one of the best&#xD;
shots in the country.&#xD;
"Many people said the4,piece was too heavy&#xD;
for common use ; but' I.was accustomed to it,&#xD;
and it didn't feel burdensome to me ; and when&#xD;
I fired, it was sure to do the right 'thing, for&#xD;
what animal. could carry offain unce, and a half&#xD;
of lead, skilfully sped on pitsr errand? .t a.-&#xD;
"Having discovered -'Indian signs one day, I&#xD;
thought it best to change my hunting ground,;&#xD;
and so put a considerable distance between my-&#xD;
self and the spot, andhencamped&amp;amp; on a wide prai-&#xD;
rie, bounded on the east by the' Cross Timbers.'&#xD;
Not long after this event,. I was sitting on the&#xD;
bank of a small stream, "resting-my weary limbs&#xD;
after a long and fatiguing "hunt, when I was&#xD;
fired upon and slightly wounded&#xD;
" I was .fortunate enough to discover the&#xD;
marks:nan, who proved to be an Indian, of what&#xD;
tribe I do not now remember. I instantly shot&#xD;
him dead, and then perceived that he was not&#xD;
alone ; for one of his brethren was with him,&#xD;
who made good his escape. , Time passed on,&#xD;
* A continuous series of forest, varying in breadth&#xD;
from five to ten miles, and extending in a direct line&#xD;
from the source of the Trinity northward to the Ar-&#xD;
kansas river. ,&#xD;
&#xD;
BRAVO.                                    63&#xD;
and I was undisturbed in my amusements for a&#xD;
long time.&#xD;
One day not feeling very well, I returned to&#xD;
my camp sooner than usual. I laid down and&#xD;
tried to sleep, but couldn't. I felt uneasy and&#xD;
nervous, and so arose and went out on to the&#xD;
prairie. The grass was now very tall, and the&#xD;
hot suns of the season had dried it until it was&#xD;
crispy, and rattled as I walked through it. I&#xD;
ascended a gentle swell and looked around me.&#xD;
The scene was a grand one. On one hand were&#xD;
the 'Cross Timbers' dimly seen in the distance,&#xD;
resembling a dense wall of wood built by human&#xD;
hands ; while in every other direction the prai-&#xD;
rie stretched, away until lost in the' distance.&#xD;
The sun was getting low, and looked like a sun-&#xD;
set on the sea. As - my eyes wandered from&#xD;
point to point, they were suddenly fixed upon a&#xD;
solitary figure several hundred yards distant, at&#xD;
the foot of the long swell or roll upon which I&#xD;
was standing.&#xD;
" He stood in an open space,. and'at first I&#xD;
wondered how that could be, as the grass was&#xD;
so high:in every other place ; but the affair soon&#xD;
explained itself.&#xD;
 "More careful observation showed me that the&#xD;
solitary figure was an Indian, and his object in&#xD;
plucking up the dry grass was evident'; he was&#xD;
going to-fire the prairie ! It was doubtless the&#xD;
Same fellow that had escaped at the tine when&#xD;
I had , been- fired at. He 'had discovered my&#xD;
retreat,.and was about to revenge his comrade&#xD;
in a signal manner.               .&#xD;
"MThe wind was blowing fresh towards me,&#xD;
and if the grass was once set on fire, no power&#xD;
on'earth could, save me, for the fleetest horse&#xD;
could not run fast enough to escape its devour-&#xD;
ing flames. A terrible dread of that kind of a&#xD;
death cane over me. I stood like one fascina-&#xD;
ted, and gazed at the preparations of the savage.&#xD;
He stood in the middle of the open space he&#xD;
had made, with a blazing torch in his hand.&#xD;
Innumerable thoughts rushed through my mind&#xD;
in an instant of time. I was never so complete-&#xD;
ly paralyzed and ,stupefied before in my life.&#xD;
The power of thought seemed the only power&#xD;
left me, and that was stimulated to an unnatu-&#xD;

ral degree. The past, present and future were&#xD;
reviewed and speculated upon in'that brief and&#xD;
broken fragment of time in which the savage&#xD;
stood waiting for the brand to burn up more&#xD;
brightly before he thrust it into the grass.&#xD;
"Yes ; my destiny was to be burned !  Some&#xD;
hunter or traveller would find my body charred&#xD;
and blackened;. and others, after a time, would&#xD;
pass my bones bleaching in .the sun. I shud-.&#xD;
dered ; my eyes felt hot ; my tongue was dr;&#xD;
and I imagined that I felt the flames creeping,&#xD;
over me. If it hid been a danger that I could,&#xD;
have battled with, or if I could have seenaiy&#xD;
chance for escape depending upon my own exer&#xD;
tions, it would have been different; bi it now all&#xD;
I could do was to stand and'staf&#xD;

while even one faint hope remained. I lifted&#xD;

As my glance ran over the intervening distance,&#xD;
I felt how desperate indeed was my prospect of&#xD;
life, for an hundred good marksmen might try&#xD;
their skill in vain, in aiming at an object so far&#xD;
off. Then I remembered that my weapon was&#xD;
of uncommon calibre and weight, and would&#xD;

"Not at all," said the captain, earnestly.&#xD;
"I should never part with it, if it was mine.'&#xD;
&#xD;
ARLY in-the morning Captain Wilson and'&#xD;
Lieutenant Cameron, leaving their horses-&#xD;
with their.companions, left the camp oi footto&#xD;
reconnoitre. Being w1acquainted'with the.&#xD;
habits of their enemis t ey apprehended little'&#xD;
or no danger in suchaapvement, ands o&#xD;
separated.     -   'nd                   ,&#xD;
Wilson struck off tothe right, and'pkrsued a&#xD;
north-westerly direction over a ruoghanmnii&#xD;

his way through musqu   ushessothiklymat&#xD;

culty to proceed.  At length  e reached .aor&#xD;
open region, and was' abbe to go.forwary 1i'ht&#xD;
less exertion.&#xD;
The wide' rolling prairies, characteristic of&#xD;
most of the country between the.Nueces and the&#xD;
Colorado, were no longer seen. The captain&#xD;
entered a narrow defile, and after following it&#xD;
for some time, ascended a sharp hill, at the foot&#xD;
of which lay a sluggish looking lake, with some&#xD;
sickly vegetation growing upon its margin.&#xD;
Near this sheet of water he discovered signs of&#xD;
a party of horsemend&#xD;
&#xD;
J pna closer inspection he felt sure that the&#xD;
treats mere produced by the small feet of the&#xD;
mustang, commonly used among the Mexicans.&#xD;
To 'p t the matter beyond doubt, he followed&#xD;
the tracsla; considerable distance, and as the&#xD;

7 ot l'ggrses' feet at full gallop caused him&#xD;
to turn his'- attention in another direction.&#xD;
Thrge Mexicans mounted after the fashion of&#xD;
thc country, upon mustangs, were advancing at&#xD;
1ie top of their speed.  Two of the party had&#xD;
lassos in their hands, ready to throw with that&#xD;
terrible precision acquired by long 'and constant&#xD;
practice, while the third held an escopeta in such&#xD;
a manner, that Wilson was led to expect im&#xD;
mediateacts of hostility.&#xD;
They abated their speed as they neared the&#xD;
ranger, evidently fearful of the effects of the&#xD;
rifle which laid across his arm. Perceiving that&#xD;
a direct approach would be likely to prove fatal&#xD;

&#xD;
to one or more of them, they began to ride&#xD;
around him in circles, and at.a considerable dis-&#xD;
tance from each other, hoping to confuse him&#xD;
and so distract his attention, that the fellow with&#xD;
the escopeta might, by a sudden movement, get&#xD;
within shooting distance ; but this idea' proved&#xD;
how little they knew of the disposition of the&#xD;
Kentuckian. So far from being embarrassed,&#xD;
or having his attention divided by their ma-&#xD;
noeuvres, he beheld them with perfect calmness&#xD;
and self-possession.&#xD;
He had been in many engagements, and&#xD;
smelled gunpowder too often to be thus easily&#xD;
frightened. Momentarily the assailants lessened-&#xD;
the diameter of their circles, shaking theirlasos,&#xD;
shouting, and scattering the sand at a great,&#xD;
rate.a&#xD;
Though the ranger dreaded the lasso, he re-&#xD;
solved to bring down the fellow withthe escopeta&#xD;
first, if possible, and then deal with the others&#xD;
as circumstances might permit. He patiently&#xD;
waited his opportunity as the circle narrowed;&#xD;
but the object he had selected for his mark seem-&#xD;
ed to mistrust his intentions, and kept. his mus-&#xD;
tang continually upon the move.&#xD;
Tired at length with this continual watchful&#xD;
ness, he let the breech of his rifle fall to the&#xD;
ground, determined to suffer them to exhanust&#xD;
themselves with their efforts.  Seeing him thus&#xD;
standing, calmly leaning upon the muzzle of&#xD;
his rifle, the Mexican checked his-aillinal, and&#xD;
raised his weapon to his shoulder.&#xD;
Knowing the Mexicans to be poor marksmen,&#xD;
and the distance being great, the ranger had no&#xD;
fears for the result, and tauntingly shouted to&#xD;
him to fire. He obeyed, and the ball struck;&#xD;
the ground several yards from the captain.,&#xD;
Cursing his poor powder and want of success,&#xD;
the Mexican scampered away to reload, leaving&#xD;
his comrades to shout and threaten, and shake&#xD;
their lassos to their hearts' content.&#xD;
In a moment the cowardly fellow returned,&#xD;
his courage somewhat increased by the report of&#xD;
his weapon. It was now apparent that he in-&#xD;
tended to try his luck again, with the additional&#xD;
improvement of getting a little nearer. Urged&#xD;
on by the taunts and sneers of his companions,&#xD;
&#xD;
he gradually approached the Kentuckian.  He&#xD;
stopped his mustang, levelled his escopeta, and&#xD;
threw himself forward in the saddle ; but Wil-&#xD;
sonr was too quick for him; he had not practised&#xD;
rifle shooting for nothing in the wilds of " Old&#xD;
Kentuck."   Before the finger of the Mexican&#xD;
had touched the trigger, a leaden messenger had&#xD;
pierced his heart ; he sprang up into the air,&#xD;
and fell to the ground never to mingle again&#xD;
with the affairs of earth.&#xD;
The mustang shook himself, smelled the body&#xD;
of his master, and with a snort shied away from&#xD;
the spot. But with Wilson the worst was to&#xD;
come; the fellows with the lassos would now be&#xD;
upon him in a moment, as his rifle was empty&#xD;
and they had no more to fear from it.  He sprang&#xD;
to reloading as fast as possible, but before the&#xD;
powder had reached the place of its destination,&#xD;
or the ball had followed it, a lasso was flying&#xD;
through the air, the fatal noose directed towards&#xD;
the captain's head.&#xD;
He avoided it by a dexterous movement, and&#xD;
before he had well recovered himself for another&#xD;
exertion, the - second lasso was suspended over&#xD;
him.  He could not wholly evade it; it caught&#xD;
his right arm in his attempt to ward it off, and&#xD;
he wad dragged several yards before he could&#xD;
extricate himself.&#xD;
And now succeeded a terrible struggle for&#xD;
life and death.; the skill with which they han-&#xD;
dled those execrable instruments of strangula-&#xD;
tion, requiring all the agility, strength, and&#xD;
presence of-mind of the Kentuckian to prevent&#xD;
the object in view. He drew a pistol, but amid&#xD;
the rapid evolutions which he was obliged to&#xD;
make, it was difficult to use it with any kind of,&#xD;
accuracy ; and he' only had the satisfaction of&#xD;
inflicting a slight flesh wound, which served to&#xD;
stimulate his antagonists to fresh exertions with&#xD;
their infernal lassos, which, despite all his en-&#xD;
deavors to the contrary, he began to believe they&#xD;
would eventually succeed in fastening upon his&#xD;
neck, when his fate would be sealed ; this ob-&#xD;
ject achieved, the mustang would be spurred into&#xD;
a gallop, and himself dragged at his heels until&#xD;
life was extinct.&#xD;
With this tragical prospect in view, the joy of&#xD;
&#xD;
the ranger may in some measure be imagined,&#xD;
when in the scuffle and confusion, he caught a&#xD;
glimpse of Cameron looking through the double&#xD;
sights. Before he could breathe twice, the fel-&#xD;
-low most active with the lasso was knocked out of&#xD;
his saddle by an ounce and a half of lead, which&#xD;
crashed through his skull, scattering his brains&#xD;
in the face of his companion.&#xD;
Struck dumb and powerless with surprise and&#xD;
horror, the latter became motionless in the very&#xD;
act of throwing his lasso. Wilson caught the&#xD;
other pistol from his side, and in a moment he&#xD;
lay beside the body of his friend.&#xD;
"God bless you, Cameron !" exclaimed Wil-&#xD;
son, sinking exhausted upon the earth.&#xD;
"Just in time," replied   the lieutenant.&#xD;
"You were having a hard time with those in-&#xD;
fernal contrivances, he added, pointing at the&#xD;
lassos which were made fast to the saddles, and&#xD;
were now trailing upon the ground as the mus-&#xD;
tangs moved away and began to nibble at the&#xD;
tufts of grass that grew here and there.&#xD;
" Alligators and snappin' turtles ! I can&#xD;
deal with anything better than those lassos,"&#xD;
said the captain, wiping 'the pe-spiration from&#xD;
his brow.&#xD;
" They are greatly to be dreaded when there&#xD;
is a proper field for their use,"  answered&#xD;
Cameron,,&#xD;
" What a relief it was to ' see you with that,&#xD;
implement of death to your faee," added Wil-'&#xD;
son.  " I knew I ivas safe"when I caught a&#xD;
glimpse of you looking along thesights; it was&#xD;
the most joyful emotion that I ever experienced,&#xD;
for I was dreadfully worried and put to my,&#xD;
trumps, I can tell you."&#xD;
"I can form a. tolerable idea of it. I was&#xD;
placed in a situation somewhat similar myself.:&#xD;
I was on a prairie between the Rio Frio and the&#xD;
.San Miguel; I stood looking at the 'western&#xD;
skies, lost in a pleasing reverie.  While in that&#xD;
position, I partially forgot myself, lei my rifle&#xD;
slip from my grasp, and fall upon the grass at&#xD;
my feet. I did not immediately pick it up, and&#xD;
it was lucky that I did not, for before the lapse&#xD;
of three minutes, I saw a Mexican chap approath-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing at a fast gallop with his lasso ready to whirl&#xD;
at my head.&#xD;
"The moment I put my eyes on him, I&#xD;
thought I could play the 'possum a little. .I&#xD;
did not so much as look towards my rifle, but&#xD;
dropped right down upon my marrow bones,&#xD;
held up both hands, and begged for mercy in&#xD;
Spanish with all the eloquence I could muster&#xD;
for the occasion. You see he thought I was&#xD;
unarmed, and advanced boldly with an expres-&#xD;
sion of malice upon his face that I shall never&#xD;
forget should I live to be as old as the most&#xD;
venerable of the patriarchs.&#xD;
"I continued to cry out most piteously un-&#xD;
til he got pretty near me, when I caught my&#xD;
rifle from among the grass, and aimed it straight&#xD;
at :his villanous countenance. It's my opinion&#xD;
you never saw a fellow sto more suddenly than&#xD;
he did, and his dark visag grew as white as a&#xD;
pale-faced girl's. I let 'hii- enjoy the surprise&#xD;
for a few' seconds, and theJ blazed away. If&#xD;
you should ever pass.over that spot in the sea-&#xD;
son of the year, you will find the prairie grass&#xD;
growing very rank there in a certain place about&#xD;
six by two. I rode his mustang into camp that&#xD;
very hour, and that is the ena; of the story."&#xD;
"And it's my opinion," answered the cap-&#xD;
tain, that we had better ride those animals&#xD;
yonder, back to our brave lads."&#xD;
"All right," said Cameron, and the mus-&#xD;
tan s were speedily caught and mounted. The&#xD;
one that had filst been freed from his rider, had&#xD;
strayed a considerable distance ; but Cameron&#xD;
found him and led him by the bridle ; in this&#xD;
manner they safely reached their companions&#xD;
before night, who had begun to feel alarmed at&#xD;
their long absence.&#xD;
The following morning the party resumed&#xD;
their way, passing over the same ground which&#xD;
Wilson had traversed the preceding day. After&#xD;
a hard ride, they encamped on the margin of a&#xD;
small salt lake, near which, was a tolerable&#xD;
growth of cypress, oak, and elm, and plenty of&#xD;
pasturage for the horses. While they were&#xD;
busily employed making preparations to pass&#xD;
the night as comfortably as the case would ad-&#xD;
mit of, Ridgley suddenly appeared among them,&#xD;

&#xD;
mounted upon a stout horse, which gave un-&#xD;
mistakeable signs of being over-ridden.&#xD;
Each man -ceased operations in surprise, for&#xD;
no arrival could have been more unexpected.&#xD;
Ridgley threw himself from his steed, and beck-&#xD;
oned Captain Wilson to approach.&#xD;
" I bring news for you," he hurriedly said.&#xD;
"The enemy are all around you; you cannot&#xD;
go forward and you cannot return. If you&#xD;
would save your lives, let each man takehis axe&#xD;
and fall to work erecting a suitable defence.&#xD;
Cut down those oaks yonder, and other trees of&#xD;
- a proper size, and.build them up into a fort or&#xD;
something of that kind, which you will know&#xD;
how to construct better than I can tell you."&#xD;
" What makes you think the danger is so&#xD;
pressing ?" asked the ranger.&#xD;
" Because your enemies number more than a&#xD;
hundred, and are bent on your destruction,&#xD;
They are moving slowly towards you, confident&#xD;
that there is no way for you to escape," replied&#xD;
Ridgley.&#xD;
"Can't we cut our way through them ?" con-&#xD;
tinued Wilson.&#xD;
"No ; it were folly to attempt it. Lose no&#xD;
time, but follow my advice."&#xD;
" But' they will starve us out," added&#xD;
Wilson.&#xD;
"Perhaps assistance will reach you before&#xD;
that time," said Ridgley.&#xD;
" What will you do?"&#xD;
"I shall take care of myself, and possibly&#xD;
do something for you; at least it is better for&#xD;
one to perish than nine brave fellows.  Shall&#xD;
"you follow my advice ?"&#xD;
"I think I shall; it can do no hurt at all&#xD;
events to put ourselves in a state of defence.&#xD;
If no enemy appears, after waiting a proper&#xD;
time, we can push forward again."&#xD;
"But what good will you do by advancing&#xD;
fartherttowards the enemy's country ?  The suc-&#xD;
cess of an expedition like this, depends upon its&#xD;
secresy.' You, it would seem, are already dis-&#xD;
covered, consequently can effect nothing on ac-&#xD;
count of your numbers."&#xD;
" There is much-reason in what you say," re-&#xD;
turned the captain. " If the enemy are really&#xD;
&#xD;
on our track, a part of our object is' already&#xD;
bafted, unless we can manage to elude them and&#xD;
leave them at fault."&#xD;
i'If you are attacked,-I know you will make&#xD;
a brave defence, and hold out to the last," re-&#xD;
sumed Ridgley. " As for our friend Ethington,&#xD;
I trust we shall be able to serve him' yet, if&#xD;
they have not already put him out of the way.&#xD;
But I must leave you. Adios, capitan !"&#xD;
Ridgley sprang to the saddle and clattered&#xD;
away as fast as the nature of the ground would&#xD;
admit.&#xD;
" That's a brave fellow," said Wilson to Cam.&#xD;
eron, pointing after the retreating figure of the&#xD;
horseman.   "He is every inch a soldier."&#xD;
"Then he is a man for the times," replied&#xD;
the lieutenant.&#xD;
" He is," was the emphatic rejoinder.&#xD;
The two officers now consulted together for&#xD;
a few moments, and then tha captain addressed&#xD;
his men as follows:&#xD;
" My bold lads, it would seem that the Mexi.&#xD;
cans are on every side of us in great numbers,&#xD;
and contemplate an easy victory over us, we be.&#xD;
ing but a handful of men.  The-person who has&#xD;
just ridden away, has brought the news, and he&#xD;
can be relied - on. We must disappoint our&#xD;
enemies, if possible, and to do so, we must erect&#xD;
some kind of a defence. Let every man of you&#xD;
fall to work with such implements as we may&#xD;
have, axes, hatchets, etc., and construct a log&#xD;
fort, in which we can use our rifles with good&#xD;
effect, while we are, at the same time, protected&#xD;
from the balls of our enemies."&#xD;
This short speech was well received, and the&#xD;
men instantly began to work. Such as had&#xD;
axes, felled trees, and others dragged their&#xD;
trunks to the spot selected for the rude struc-&#xD;
ture, to which they intended to give the name&#xD;
of a fort.&#xD;
The black and post oak were principally em-&#xD;
ployed for this purpose, being locked together&#xD;
.at the ends by notches upon each side, which&#xD;
gave firmness to the fabric. Leaving the work&#xD;
going on. very rapidly, Wilson and Cameron&#xD;
went forth to reconnoitre, and bring in some&#xD;
game, if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
They made a long detour around the camp, v&#xD;
but saw nothing to excite suspicion, and began f&#xD;
to question the soundness of Ridgley's advice.V&#xD;
They were fortunate enough to kill a deer, and&#xD;
returned to their comrades pretty well convinced t&#xD;
that the danger had been greatly overrated by b&#xD;
their friend. But they thought it best not to&#xD;
express their views on the subject, and so fell to&#xD;
work and assisted the men.&#xD;
Before the sun was up in the morning, they&#xD;
had the satisfaction of seeing their labors nearly&#xD;
compl ted.  The walls were erected, and the top&#xD;
covered over with getimber, which could not&#xD;
be easily fired. Notches had been cut in the&#xD;
logs previous to their being placed, which, when&#xD;
they were fitted into the structure at the proper&#xD;
height, gave the fabric the appearance of being&#xD;
pierced for loop-holes, after the fashion of more,&#xD;
elaborate fortifications.&#xD;
The Texan rifles were to play a conspicuous&#xD;
part through  those rough apertures.   The&#xD;
horses were next to be cared for, and it was&#xD;
unanimously agreed to leadthem to the opposite&#xD;
side of the lake, where there was good pasturage,&#xD;
and let them shift for themselves. This proposal&#xD;
was duly carried into effect. The finishing&#xD;
touches were put to the fort, and the Texans&#xD;
were prepared for an enemy. Their numbers,&#xD;
all told, amounted to, nine-the captain and&#xD;
lieutenant, six Rangers, and Felix. The men&#xD;
were in good spirits, and longed to test the&#xD;
superiority of their weapons over the fire-arms of&#xD;
the " blanketed nation," as they contemptuous-&#xD;
ly called the Mexicans.&#xD;
In asserting that the men were in good spirits,&#xD;
we perhaps ought to make one exception. 'There&#xD;
was one among them, evidently advanced in life,&#xD;
who had been in, many skirmishes with the In-&#xD;
dians, and who had never, as the saying is,&#xD;
"shown the white feather " on any occasion.&#xD;
He was a daring, iron-sinewed fellow, always the&#xD;
first in mirth and danger.  But now the sound&#xD;
of his laughter was not heard ; his jokes and&#xD;
sallies of wit no longer infused life into his com-&#xD;
panions ; he worked on in silence. It was in&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
ain that the men rallied him; they brought j&#xD;
orth no genial sparks; he was deaf to all their &#xD;
well meant jests.&#xD;
When the fort was completed he stood near&#xD;
he captain, contemplating it with a gloomy&#xD;
brow.&#xD;
"Parker, you look sad. What ails you,&#xD;
man ?" said Wilson, laying his hand in a famil-&#xD;
ar manner upon his shoulder.&#xD;
"A strange feeling has fallen upon my&#xD;
spirits " replied Parker, in a low tone of voice.&#xD;
'Every time I look at that fort we have built,&#xD;
I cannot shake off the conviction that I am&#xD;
ooking at the spot where my grave will be&#xD;
dug."&#xD;
"It's nothing, my brave fellow, but hard&#xD;
service and want of rest," returned the cap-&#xD;
tain.  " Sleep two hours, and you will wake up&#xD;
all right."&#xD;
"No, captain, no sleep can take away the&#xD;
impression that my end is fast approaching. I&#xD;
have often heard of people having such a feel-&#xD;
ing whei death was very near. Look there,&#xD;
captain, where the sun-shadow falls across the&#xD;
door of the fort ; 'at this hour, on the morrow,&#xD;
it will rest on the mound that covers me. Don't&#xD;
think I am afraid, for I am not. I never was&#xD;
a coward-I never was away from my post&#xD;
when there was fighting to be done, and never'&#xD;
shall be while I can look through the sights ;&#xD;
so don't attribute this feeling to weakness, but&#xD;
to the kindness of that great Being who does,&#xD;
not wish to remove a -sinful human creature like&#xD;
me without warning, but gives him a chance to&#xD;
reflect a little on his past life.&#xD;
"It's very singular," said Wilson.&#xD;
" I grant it, but you will know by this time&#xD;
to-morrow," replied Parker, and the conversa-&#xD;
tion was dropped.&#xD;
Hour after hour passed, and the men grew&#xD;
impatient, for there were no signs of an enemy.&#xD;
Both Cameron and Wilson feared they had&#xD;
wasted valuable time in useless labor, and re-&#xD;
solved to move forward in the morning, if no&#xD;

enemy appeared. Just before sunset, all their&#xD;
,,doubts in regard to the expediency of what they&#xD;
had done, vanished. About an hundred mount-&#xD;
ed Mexicans appeared on all sides of them, ex-&#xD;
cept that bounded by the lake. The hearts of&#xD;
the boldest among the Rangers beat faster at&#xD;
beholding such overpowering numbers ; they&#xD;
felt, and justly, too, that their case was a des-&#xD;
perate one.&#xD;
" Here's work for us, boys," said Cameron,&#xD;
calmly. " We must fight or die, and perhaps&#xD;
do both," he added, in a lower tone of voice.&#xD;
" Felix?" said Wilson.&#xD;
"Yes, massa," said Felix.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Can you use a rifle ?"&#xD;
"I can 'spress myself in dat line."&#xD;
"Well, here is one ; it belongs to your mas-&#xD;
ter-the bravest of the brave ; see that you do&#xD;
not disgrace it."&#xD;
"Go yer death, massa Kentuck."&#xD;
"And you go yours."&#xD;
"I shall 'luminate de subject ob makin' de&#xD;
daylight shine frough. I shall fight like de&#xD;

The Texan Rangers silently took their places,&#xD;
and with their trusty rifles grasped firmly in their&#xD;
hands, awaited the assaults  their enemies.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIIL1&#xD;
TIHE CACEL AT LAREDO-'THE MEXICAN MAIDE1.&#xD;
&#xD;
E left lthington in a critical position.&#xD;
\AJ\,Ir His fate seemed inevitable.  Armed&#xD;
men were drawn up in order before him, who&#xD;
waited but the word of command from their&#xD;
leader, to terminate his existence ; but that or-&#xD;
der -was never given.. The consultation among&#xD;
the three most proaninent characters of the&#xD;
group ended, and hasty preparations Were made&#xD;
for a march.&#xD;
The whole party were soon in the saddle and&#xD;
moving forward in the direction of the Rio&#xD;
Grande. The sudden change in the aspect of&#xD;
affairs surprised our hero not a little. By&#xD;
some strange dispensation of Providence (for he&#xD;
was disposed to consider it providential), he had&#xD;
been snatched from the very jaws of death, and&#xD;
reserved for a destiny known only to the great&#xD;
Disposer of events.&#xD;
He was placed on horseback with the rest,&#xD;
and strongly guarded.  Wikoff and Cogswell&#xD;
kept a little in advance of the cavalcade, deter-&#xD;
red either from shame or some other cause from&#xD;
keeping near Ethington, for which he was grate-&#xD;
ful; as their society would have been an inflie-&#xD;
&#xD;
tion he could not have endured calaly. Whethsi&#xD;
er Ethington felt that degree of gratitude to as&#xD;
higher power which most men under similar cir-&#xD;
cumstances would have felt, we are not prepare&#xD;
ed to say ; but it is certain that the 'startling&#xD;
incidents of the day produced a long train of re&#xD;
flections which were not without their benefieild&#xD;
results upon his mind.&#xD;
He thought of Andrea with less bitterness,&#xD;
and his whol being was pervaded by a more&#xD;
forgiving spirit towards her. He was even dis-&#xD;
posed to regret his hastiness in leaving her. o&#xD;
abruptly, without first seeking an explanation.&#xD;
The many imperfections in his own character&#xD;
had never appeared so palpable. Though his&#xD;
heart was softened by the spell of his betters&#xD;
angel, his courage and natural energy of charac._&#xD;
ter were not yet subdued.&#xD;
He felt within- himself the same energy to&#xD;
overcome difficulties, or to Meet a foe, that had&#xD;
heretofore characterized him and given him the&#xD;
name (among his enemies) of the " Texan&#xD;
Bravo ;" an appellation which, though not en-i&#xD;
tirely deserved, could very well be applied to&#xD;

bands of banditti and villains, and our hero the "I have no desire to know."&#xD;
most daring and desperate among them.         " I will tell you; I am going to see Miss St.&#xD;

&#xD;
ance and torture could have been more success-&#xD;
ful than that adopted by Wikoff; and the latter&#xD;
perceived the fact and congratulated himself&#xD;
upon his cunning.,&#xD;
He left the cartel, well satisfied with the pain&#xD;
he had inflicted, and resolved to render his suf-&#xD;
fering still more intense.&#xD;
Although Walter had been willing to believe&#xD;
a short time before, that Andrea had possibly&#xD;
given Wikoff some encouragement, and perhaps&#xD;
some trifling mark of 'favor, a revulsion now&#xD;
took place in his mind, and he was strongly in-&#xD;
clined to the opinion that he would be obliged&#xD;
to trust more to stratagem to bring about his&#xD;
wishes, than to the usual mode of wooing a fair&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
Knowing him to be a villain, and wholly unfit&#xD;
to be the companion of one like Andrea, not-&#xD;
withstanding her infidelity to himself, Ethington&#xD;
now felt an eager desire to escape in order to&#xD;
baffle him in his designs, if for no other reason.&#xD;
In the event of his effecting this object, if&#xD;
he should be able to discover that Miss St. Au-&#xD;
bert had really entertained any friendly feelings&#xD;
towards him, he would contrive some way to&#xD;
warn her of her danger, and thus discharge a&#xD;
duty which he felt that he should owe to any,&#xD;
female similarly situated.&#xD;
Ethington's unexpected. meeting with An-&#xD;
drea, had called up many emotions which he had'&#xD;
known in the past. When the' first .shock of&#xD;
surprise consequent upon that unexpected meet-&#xD;
ing had passed away, and he had thought calm-&#xD;
ly and rationally upon the subject, he was quite&#xD;
sure that he had judged -too hastily in regard to&#xD;
any cgnection which she might have had with&#xD;
Wikoff's object in being near her on the night&#xD;
of the attack upon Bexar,&#xD;
Without pausing to notice the different'&#xD;
phases of thought and feeling which agitated&#xD;
him -by turns, we will reiterate the fact that he&#xD;
was now fully determined to make strong efforts&#xD;
to regain his liberty.&#xD;
The next time the turnkey visited him he&#xD;
complained.of his chains-that they hurt his&#xD;
wrists and' ankles, and needed to be more skil-&#xD;
fully adjusted, or changed for others less objec-&#xD;
&#xD;
tionable.  By dint of fair words he prevailed&#xD;
upon the turnkey to send the blacksmith to ex-&#xD;
amine the obnoxious portions of the chain, and&#xD;
if he thought proper, to make the desired alter&#xD;
ation.&#xD;
So much being conceded, he hoped he should&#xD;
be able to manage the rest without difficulty.&#xD;
The smith came, and was left with our herb&#xD;
" Well, senor, what's wanting'?" he asked;&#xD;
throwing some of the more common implements&#xD;
of his trade upon the'floor",For a reply, Ething&#xD;
ton managed to get his hand into his vest poe&#xD;
et and take out a piece of money.&#xD;
"My jewelry does not fit well," he said'&#xD;
with a significant smile.  "You will oblige m'&#xD;
by taking out those iron rivets and putting lea&#xD;
ones in their places."*&#xD;
".Jesu, senor 1" exclaimed the smith, app&#xD;
rently horrified at the proposal&#xD;
"It is easily done,'' added Ethington.&#xD;
"Ah, Dios !" he added, not forgetting&#xD;
pocket the money. " What would be' done'&#xD;
me if I-should be discovered !"        - '&#xD;
"There is no need of being discovered " co&#xD;
tinted Walter.&#xD;
"But If they should chance to come in 6&#xD;
catch you with your chains off.   Gracioe&#xD;
Dios !"&#xD;
" That they will not do ; I will be careful.&#xD;
"I .should be shot in the plaza ; Si -'&#xD;
cierto "-yes, for certain.&#xD;
"7Tonteria-nonsense ; you willdie in yo&#xD;
bed, with your friends all around 'you. '8&#xD;
I have more of the dust."&#xD;
The turnkey entered and interrupted this&#xD;
teresting conversation.&#xD;
"Mi Dios !'' cried the smith, pretending&#xD;
examine the chains. " These things must&#xD;
fixed; precicoes-it is necessary ; they w'&#xD;
kill him. I will go and get sonie inre suitab&#xD;
implements and return."&#xD;
With a significant wink at Ethington,' t&#xD;
a Some would bribe the blacksmith to make the&#xD;

with charcoal had much the appearance of irati, yh'&#xD;

worker jin iron left the carcel-to come back&#xD;
"after the lapse of half an hour, duly provided&#xD;
with leaden rivets, which were properly placed,&#xD;
Maceording to our hero's wishes.&#xD;
It was about dark when these operations were&#xD;
completed , and after receiving a liberal reward,&#xD;
the smithdeparted with a pleasant "buenos&#xD;
SoQ/pes "--good night.&#xD;
. The outer door of the cartel had scarcely&#xD;
closed upon him, when Ethington's jewelry was&#xD;
lying ;harmlessly beside him. So far, all had&#xD;
;gone, well; other steps were now to be consid-&#xD;
ered, and he lay awake a long time during the&#xD;
eight, concocting various plans of escape, very&#xD;
few of which, upon mature consideration, ap-&#xD;
peared feasible.&#xD;
When the turnkey brought him his black&#xD;
bread and water the next morning, he was still&#xD;
undecided. While he was examining the car-j&#xD;
eel, and puzzling his brains for expedients, a&#xD;
Mexican female was ushered into his cell.  The&#xD;
urnkey drew  back, closed the door, and the&#xD;
two persons thus left cara a cara, regarded&#xD;
pseh other with'profound embarrassment.&#xD;
The young lady was very pretty, and wore&#xD;
e silken ribosa, that covered her shoulders 1&#xD;
m4neck, with charming grace.i&#xD;
" Good morning, senorita," said Ethington,&#xD;
the language of the country, and bowing very&#xD;

The bright-eyed beauty blushed like a peony, n&#xD;
ta  gathered her ribosa more closely about her&#xD;
;Qnely person.                             s&#xD;
" You are an American ?" she said,.or rather, 1&#xD;

Walter replied in the affirmative, and with e&#xD;
smile politely pointed towards the only seat&#xD;
the cell.&#xD;
" Ave Maria!" she added, glancing about&#xD;
be little cell.  "What a close place, and&#xD;
rhat irons they have put upon you, senor&#xD;
" They are very ungraceful, senorita. Should&#xD;

"Sure enough I why should you !"~ said ci&#xD;

Ethington. "Now, fair doncella, tell me what&#xD;
you wish ; or more properly, the object of your&#xD;
visit?"&#xD;
" Not to harm you, senor."- replied the&#xD;
maiden.&#xD;
"Ah, I can well believe that," answered&#xD;
Walter. " The heart of kind woman is the&#xD;
same Jall over the world. When she visits the&#xD;
prisoner, it isusually to do the work of an angel&#xD;
of mercy."&#xD;
" Muchisimas gracias-thank you ; it is&#xD;
kind of you to say so. Do you know any of&#xD;
the Texan Rangers ?"&#xD;
" I know them well; I have fought, side by&#xD;
side with them many a time."&#xD;
"There is one among them-"&#xD;
The maiden hesitated and looked down.&#xD;
" I read part of your secret, I think. There&#xD;
is one among them whom you know !" added&#xD;
Walter.&#xD;
Si, senor."&#xD;
"Perhaps he is fond of'you," continued the&#xD;
other, softly. "May I ask his name ?"&#xD;
" Cameron," said the maiden.&#xD;
"Lieutenant Cameron-a brave fellow ; and&#xD;
ho is honorable, too. 'If he has made any prom-&#xD;
ses, he will keep them."&#xD;
" Bueno !" said she, and seemed well pleased.&#xD;
" But tell me, how you came here ; I will sit&#xD;
down here and listen very patiently; I shall&#xD;
not be tired."&#xD;
And Carmencita-for that was her-name-&#xD;
at down and remained quiet, while Ethington&#xD;
caned against the wall and told her how he was&#xD;
aptured, together with some of the principal&#xD;
vents in his history.&#xD;
"You were at the Alamo, then ?"&#xD;
"I was, doncella."&#xD;
" You saved a young man's life there ?"&#xD;
" I did."&#xD;
" That was my brother," said Carmencita.&#xD;
" How fortunate that I did so ; because it&#xD;
ai d you so much grief."&#xD;
" And saved your life ?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
" And shall save it again," added'Carmen-&#xD;
ta, firmly. " I love him very much, and I&#xD;
&#xD;
am grateful to you, because you saved his life.&#xD;
I am sorry that you are so unhappy. Was this&#xD;
Andrea you have spoken of, so very cruel and&#xD;
deceitful?"&#xD;
Ethington sighed and remained silent.&#xD;
"You look sad ; it was very wrong of her to&#xD;
deceive you. But let us think of getting you&#xD;
out of this gloomy carcel."&#xD;
" I am not averse to that, though having&#xD;
formed so agreeable an acquaintance, I am not&#xD;
so anxious in that respect as I was." .&#xD;
",You may be obliged to stay here some time&#xD;
yet to enjoy it," replied Carmencita, with a&#xD;
laugh. " But you must be patient ; I may not&#xD;
be able to do anything for you in one day, or&#xD;
two, perhaps, yet you are safe."&#xD;
"I seem to be safe,'"' said Walter, looking at&#xD;
the damp stone walls.&#xD;
"Yes, but not in that sense. You shall be&#xD;
at liberty before a week. Remember that I am&#xD;
your friend, and protectress. Colonel Savrie-&#xD;
gro is expected here daily."&#xD;
" And who is Colonel Savriegro !" asked&#xD;
Walter.        F&#xD;
" Mi padre-my father," answered Carmen-&#xD;
eita. "When he returns to Laredo, you shall&#xD;
&#xD;
BRAVO.                                     75 I&#xD;
be set at liberty, and before that time if pos-&#xD;
sible."&#xD;
Ethington expressed his thanks in graceful&#xD;
terms, and saw, with a sigh, the door of the2&#xD;
cartel shut out the charming figure of his new&#xD;
friend.&#xD;
Misanthrope as he had been, and still was,&#xD;
he was not insensible to the worth'of the other&#xD;
sex.  He felt that it was an amelioration of his&#xD;
sufferings to have the sympathy of one gentle&#xD;
heart ; and if he sighed when the darkeyed&#xD;
Carmencita passed from sight, he was sadder&#xD;
when he could no longer hear the light echo of&#xD;
her footsteps.&#xD;
Musing upon the tones which still lingered&#xD;
like some sweet perfume with which the senses&#xD;
had been momentarily regaled, he repeated the&#xD;
burning words of England's noblest bard:&#xD;
"I have not loved the world, nor the worldme,--&#xD;
But let us part fair foes ; I do believe,&#xD;
Though I have found them not, that there may be&#xD;
Words which are things-hopes which will not de.&#xD;
ceive,&#xD;
And virtues which are merciful, nor weave&#xD;
Snares for the failing; I would also deem&#xD;
O'er others' griefs that some sincerely grieve ;&#xD;
That two, or one, are almost what they seem-&#xD;
That goodness is no name, and happiness no'dream."&#xD;

Despite an occasional visit from Carmencita,&#xD;
Walter felt depressed, and a rapidly increasing&#xD;

and fixed itself most deeply upon his pind, that&#xD;

and save her, even as he should do for any&#xD;
female under heaven. That she was in dan-1&#xD;

that he. hoped aught from Andrea;,for he did&#xD;
:not. To him she was dead, and there could' be&#xD;
no resurrection.&#xD;
One day the turnkey thrust another prisoner&#xD;
into his cell. His plea for doing this was that&#xD;
the cartel was full, and there was no alterna-&#xD;
tive.  Ethington expostulated, but it availed&#xD;
nothing.&#xD;
" He is a very harmless fellow," said the&#xD;
turnkey ; " and you will like him. He is so&#xD;
peaceable that I put no irons, upon him, you-&#xD;
see. Ah, Dios!, I wish they were all as docile."&#xD;
If the new-comer was" docile," his appearance&#xD;
greatly belied him ; 'for Walter, after a hasty&#xD;
scrutiny, determined that a more ugly looking&#xD;
fellow never respired wititin the four walls of a&#xD;
prison. He was a Mexican, and seemed to&#xD;
have been picked .up front among the lowest of&#xD;
the robber hordes that infest the dark valleys&#xD;
and gloomy mountains of Mexico. His face,&#xD;
&#xD;
that portion of it not lost in a wilderness of&#xD;
dirty black beard, was frightfully seamed with&#xD;
scars, received, he only could tell where and&#xD;
under what circumstances.&#xD;
His apparel had been rich and showy in its&#xD;
day, with the full complement of silver buttons&#xD;
and red stuffs ; but its gaudiness had long since&#xD;
passed away, and it now, exhibited only a large&#xD;
amount of filth and raggedness. He had a&#xD;
strong odor of vino mescal, and was enjoying a&#xD;
cigarillo at the moment of his entry.&#xD;
"He's as gentle as a lamb," added the turn-'&#xD;
key.&#xD;
-The fellow drew forth his cigarillo, grinned&#xD;
horribly, and bowed..&#xD;
"What's his crime ?" asked Walter, not at&#xD;
all liking the tout ensemble of his prison-mate.&#xD;
"He is suspected' of- holding treasonable.&#xD;
communication with los Arnericanos," said the&#xD;
turnkey, and retired.&#xD;
The worthy gentleman took possession of&#xD;
Ethington's couch of straw without ceremony,&#xD;
and smoked away at the stump of his cigarillo&#xD;
with admirable nonchalance, eyeing our hero all&#xD;
the while with much attention.&#xD;
"Will you have a cigarro ?" he asked.&#xD;
Walter declined the proffered civility.&#xD;
Ah ! lo que es el mundo! ah, what is the&#xD;
world ?" he exclaimed, in a sentimental way,&#xD;
though in a voice far from musical. - " It's a&#xD;
miserable world," he added, " a very rascally&#xD;
world."&#xD;
" Perhaps, so," replied Walter.&#xD;
"I know it is," resumed the fellow ; " I.&#xD;
shouldn't be here, if it were not so ; no se,&#xD;
senor."&#xD;
From the instant Ethington saw this man, he&#xD;
had felt a conviction within him that his object&#xD;
in coming there was not a good one'; that (to&#xD;
be plain) some evil was meditated against him-&#xD;
self. His sinister expression, a certain villanous,&#xD;
twinkle :in the eye, his easy devil-may-care&#xD;
familiarity, all tended to strengthen his suspi-&#xD;
cions, and put him upon his guard.&#xD;
"I have heard, senor, that you are a 'des-&#xD;
perate fighterT he remarked, after a silence of&#xD;
several minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Walter thought it best to encourage this idea,&#xD;
and therefore replied:&#xD;
"Yes, I am a match for three Mexicans."&#xD;
'You must be very strong.- What do,you&#xD;
eat?" said the new-comer, with a shrug of the&#xD;
shoulders, and a facetious expression.&#xD;
Raw flesh t" answered Walter, gruffly.&#xD;
"What kind, senor ?"&#xD;
"I prefer a tender Mexican," replied Wal-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
"Mi Dios!" exclaimed the fellow, nth a&#xD;
scowl.  "Los    Americanos   are cannibals !&#xD;
Well, I have heard so. Do you love to fight?"&#xD;
"Prodigiously !" said Walter. " If these&#xD;
chains were off, I should like to try it with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
His prison-mate perpetrated a strange laugh&#xD;
resembling the growl of a young bear.&#xD;
Walter's suspicions were now fully awakened,&#xD;
and he resolved to watch the Mexican closely.&#xD;
In order to do so, when he believed himself&#xD;
unobserved, he closed his eyes after . little&#xD;
time, and feigned sleep. The prisoner address-&#xD;
ed him, but Ethington made no reply.&#xD;
"I have fought in various places, senor"&#xD;
he said ; but there was no response,&#xD;
"I have received my share of wounds, too.&#xD;
I have deserved well of:   country, and yen&#xD;
see how Iam rewarded. As I said before, it is&#xD;
a rascally world."&#xD;
Walter's breathing was deep and, natural.&#xD;
His chest heaved as a, sleeping person's , chent&#xD;
should ; but his eyes were not quite shut.=It&#xD;
was near the hour of night ; the sun's beams&#xD;
were receding rapidly from the prison, and made&#xD;
but a faint track of light across the bars of the&#xD;
grated windows. The first mist of twilightcam&#xD;
stealing in.&#xD;
" You are bad company, senor ; I believe you.&#xD;
are sleeping."  Our hero respired heavily,'and&#xD;
made a slight spasmodic movement, as sleepii&#xD;
persons are apt to do.&#xD;
The man laid aside his sombrero, which&#xD;
he had worn till now, threw, aside', the~,sht&#xD;
stump of his cigarro, and scrutinized W t~er'l&#xD;
features particularly; As he bent fgrw~rI to&#xD;

Walter now resolved to make an experiment&#xD;
which possibly might be the means of regaining&#xD;
his liberty, and perhaps; on the contrary, might&#xD;
add to the rigor of his imprisonment. He placed&#xD;
the whistle to his lips and blew a shrill blast.&#xD;
In a short time he heard steps approaching, and&#xD;
presently the door of his cell was opened by the&#xD;
turnkey.&#xD;
Walter drew the sombrero over his eyes, and&#xD;
jostled him in such a manner, while he was en-&#xD;
tering, as tQ knock the light from his hand.&#xD;
" It is done," he whispered, "let us go."&#xD;
"Jesu, senor !  So soon ." exclaimed the&#xD;
turnkey.&#xD;
"Yes, it is all over; .come away," and&#xD;
Ethington caught him by the arm, and hurried&#xD;
him.along the corridor of the carcel towards the&#xD;
little court opening upon the street. They&#xD;
stood before the large door of the prison ; the&#xD;

keeper fumbled in his girdle for the key; but, it&#xD;

the right one. They passed into the court, and&#xD;
a gate was yet to be opened.&#xD;
"Was it easily done ?" asked his conductor,&#xD;
as ho placed a key in the lock.&#xD;
" Quite " said Walter.  "One blow, and&#xD;
all was over."&#xD;
"Life is short," moralized the keeper.&#xD;
Very, and changeful, too," answered Wal-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
The key had already turned in the, lock of&#xD;
the outer gate, when the first rays of the moon,&#xD;
which had just arisen, fell across Walter's face.&#xD;
"Ah, Dios / whom have we here ?" exclaim-&#xD;
ed the keeper.&#xD;
For a reply, Walter knocked him down, and&#xD;
pushing open the gate, ran from the career as&#xD;
fast as possible.&#xD;

&#xD;
HE night drew on apace and flung its&#xD;
silent shadows over the land of the&#xD;
" Lone Star." Prairie, lake and chapparel&#xD;
were wrapped in the dreamy mists of the hour.&#xD;
The gentle winds had departed with the sun,&#xD;
and left the leaves at rest. The wild melody of&#xD;
birdsfloated no longer upon the fragrant air.&#xD;
The little lake near the fort seemed to slumber&#xD;
in the stillness.&#xD;
Men," said Wilson, "a serious contest is&#xD;
before us. But we are well protected by these&#xD;
rough yet firm walls of wood, We have for a&#xD;
long time been trained to war, and each of us&#xD;
knows what is required of him in a case like&#xD;
this. In our hands we hold the weapons which&#xD;
have sent terror among our enemies more than&#xD;
once. No men living understand the art of&#xD;
using them better than we. The Texan Ran-&#xD;
gers are well known and dreaded, and we will&#xD;
not throw a stigma upon their well-earned repu-&#xD;
tation. Yonder you can discern the bivouac of&#xD;
our foes ; they are cowards when matched with&#xD;
equal numbers, and revengeful when the superi-&#xD;
ority of numbers gives them an advantage. They&#xD;
&#xD;
will destroy us to a man, if, they can, and the&#xD;
fate of the defenders of the Alamo and of Goliad&#xD;
tells us what we may expect. Let us remember&#xD;
that we were at San Jacinto, and do our duty&#xD;
to the last. ( Surrender, we will not ; I, for one,&#xD;
would sooner perish where I stand.".&#xD;
"And I also," said Cameron ; " and I also,"&#xD;
responded every one.&#xD;
" Shall we wait for them to attack us ?" ask-&#xD;
ed Wilson ; "or shall we give them a taste of&#xD;
our metal; ,they are within reach of us, as you&#xD;
will perceive."&#xD;
"Perhaps we had better keep quiet until&#xD;
they make a demonstration," replied Cameron.&#xD;
"They are, preparing to do it now," return-&#xD;
ed Wilson.    " See, a small party have mount-&#xD;
ed their mustangs to see what they Can make of&#xD;
us at a nearer point of view.  They are armed&#xD;
with carbines and escopetas, I should judge.&#xD;
They hope the darkness will render their bodies&#xD;
rather indistinct marks for our rifles. . They&#xD;
expect to draw our fire at but little personal&#xD;
hazard, and thus determine our strength."&#xD;

"There are about fifteen advancing.- I won-&#xD;
der how many empty- saddles will return; it&#xD;
would be interesting to know. I wish the moon&#xD;
would'hurry up.  How still it is; such a hush&#xD;
this frequently precedes storms. I would&#xD;
give something to know what those fellows are&#xD;
thinking of. Perhaps the fear of death has al-&#xD;
ready fallen upon some of them with all its chill-&#xD;
ing mystery."&#xD;
Parker, who was standing near Cameron,&#xD;
turned towards him with a strange though quiet&#xD;
smile, faintly discernible in the feeble light&#xD;
which crept in through the pierced walls.&#xD;
"I should think they might feel some dismal&#xD;
forebodings. If there are indeed presentiments&#xD;
they should have them; for they are so near&#xD;
their dissolution," added Wilson, impressively,&#xD;
"that the angel of death might crush them with&#xD;
his wings Is he flies over."&#xD;
"I will pick off the leader," said Cameron.&#xD;
Good heavens ! how tardy the moon is 1,"&#xD;
"We can see well enough to answer our pur-&#xD;
pose, I think. Now, men, see if you can cover&#xD;
an object with your steel barrels. Let your&#xD;
barkers speak up sharp and disturb the diges-&#xD;
tion of some of those fellows !  Cameron, give&#xD;
yonder chap an ounce and a half."&#xD;
" It shall be done, captain," said the lieu-&#xD;
tenant.&#xD;
"Go yer death, massa Kentuck," added&#xD;
Felix.&#xD;
"I can cover him," added Cameron.&#xD;
"Then give it to him."&#xD;
A single report broke the silence; the fore-&#xD;
most saddle was emptied, the party drew such&#xD;
denly up and were motionless for a brief space ;&#xD;
but that brief space was enough. The Rangers&#xD;
instantly pounced in their fire, with what effect&#xD;
they could not well judge ; for the darkness of&#xD;
the hour and the smoke served to cover the&#xD;
retreat of the survivors; but it was quite cer-&#xD;
tain from the speed with which they returned to&#xD;
&#xD;
This prompt and probably unexpected re&#xD;
pulse checked the ardor of the assailants for the&#xD;
time being, and the Rangers began to believe&#xD;
that they shouldn't be .molested again during:&#xD;
the night,. but they were doomed to disappoint-&#xD;
ment. Just before the dawn of day there was&#xD;
a general assault upon the fort. Advancing upon&#xD;
all sides, save that towards the lake, they, dis-&#xD;
charged their carbines, and received the fire of&#xD;
the Texans. Some of- them  reached the ° fort&#xD;
and clambered upon its flat roof; others passed&#xD;
them up'dry sticks and every combustible mate;&#xD;
rial that they could obtain. After several at-&#xD;
tempts, a dense smoke curled up from the roof,&#xD;
and presently a flame, which soon streamed up&#xD;
into the skies, reflecting fantastic shadows upoi"&#xD;
the lake.&#xD;
During the time occupied in producing: th n.'&#xD;
result, the Rangers had not been idle ; they&#xD;
had employed their weapons with deadly 'efl'et;&#xD;
but the darkness that is always the precursor of&#xD;
day, proved their enemy.&#xD;
"They can't reach us," said Wilson, "un-&#xD;
less they burn us out, and these logs"are "t01&#xD;
green to afford them much chance of thatt"&#xD;
"They begin to give back," renriaked'Cam-&#xD;
eron. "The Texan rifles terrify them. ,HalW&#xD;
what was that ?"&#xD;
"I heard nothing new," replied Wilson.&#xD;
"I smell fire !" exclaimed Cameron. "Look&#xD;
up'! they have kindled a fire over our head.&#xD;
The infernal heathen wish to burn us alive."&#xD;
"Keep cool-they can't do it !" cried Wil&#xD;
son.  "The logs are too wet to burn-it will&#xD;
go out of itself. Give it to them, men--e&#xD;
lively-blaze away  wherever you see their&#xD;
heads-be sure that every shot tells."&#xD;
"The 'Lone Star' forever !" shouted the&#xD;
Rangers.&#xD;
Wilson paused and looked anxiously up; b&#xD;
fire was indeed spreading.&#xD;
"I thought it was too green to burn," : _&#xD;
observed, while a painful shade of anxiety crps&#xD;
ed his face.&#xD;
&#xD;

Green wood makes the hottest lire wh&#xD;

-'Look -a heah, massa Kentuck," observe&#xD;
Felix. "Jest let dis darkey feller out, an&#xD;
he'l fix de fire in no time, and perhaps less da&#xD;
dat."&#xD;
£ ":Nonsense, Felix ! they'll fix you, mor&#xD;
likely," returned the captain.&#xD;
'"I isn't a good mark, mass cap'en," h&#xD;
answered.-&#xD;
"And whynot ?" asked Wilson.&#xD;
"'Kase I's so near de cullor ob de night,&#xD;
rejoined the African..&#xD;
" They'll see the whites of those two eyes,'&#xD;
remarked Cameron.;.&#xD;
'I wasn't 'dressin' myself to you," sai(&#xD;
Felir, with dignity.&#xD;

",What can you do out there, Felix'?" asked&#xD;
Wilson,,after looking again anxiously at the&#xD;
flames, which were fast increasing in volume.&#xD;
"Fyrow off de combustionable sticks, and&#xD;
pitch de Mexicums to de debbil," replied Felix,&#xD;
firmly. "Now open de door and let me out&#xD;
quick, for de flames begin to promulgate like&#xD;
tinder,"          . one&#xD;
Wilson cast one more hurried glance upward,&#xD;
and then said :&#xD;
" Go, and if you are killed, we shall lose one&#xD;
of h best niggers in the world."&#xD;
Ltot me look out in that direction before&#xD;
you unbarthe door," said Cameron.- "Now's&#xD;
your time-all clear-let him out," he added,'&#xD;
immediately..&#xD;
Ay !" said Wilson-" open it is-go it,&#xD;
Felix."&#xD;
' Go yer death !" crud the latter, and dash-&#xD;
ed out into the open air where the bullets were&#xD;
fiarig like, hailstones. In a moment he had&#xD;
gr fme4the ends of the' projecting logs, and&#xD;
drawn himself to the.. roof. Two of the enemy&#xD;
&#xD;
en were still there, feeding the flames with dry&#xD;
ey sticks and bark which their comrades threw up&#xD;
to them. The African sprang towards them&#xD;
3d with irresistible fury ; one he felled 'with his&#xD;
Ld fist,' and the other he caught in his athletic&#xD;
en arms and threw from the roof as he would have&#xD;
thrown a billet of wood ; another moment and&#xD;
re he was scattering the blazing brands in all diree.&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
le A loud shout arose from the Mexicans, and&#xD;
a shower of balls whistled about him as he spun&#xD;
the flaming materials away with his foot. The&#xD;
" task was done; the negro swung his old hat in&#xD;
the air-shouted at the top of his voice :&#xD;
"    " Go yer death, yer debbils !" leaped down&#xD;
and was instantly pulled into the fort by Wilson&#xD;
d and Cameron.&#xD;
"Heaven bless your woolly head !" exclaim.&#xD;
e ed the captain.  "There's considerable of the&#xD;
Kentucky alligator about you, after all. You're&#xD;
a brave darkey, and I'll bear that in mind.".&#xD;
"'Spress yerself-pile it on," said Felix.&#xD;
It being near dawn, the enemy made no&#xD;
farther attempts to fire the fort, but kept up a&#xD;
continual discharge of carbines and escopetas,&#xD;
covering themselves as much as possible behind&#xD;
trees, rocks and shrubbery to guard against the&#xD;
fatal effects of the Texan rifles.  The chapparel&#xD;
served their purpose very well, and the firing&#xD;
was most frequent in that direction. Occasion-&#xD;
ally a bullet would find its way through a cre-&#xD;
vice, and its strength being spent, roll' harm-&#xD;
lessly upon the ground, or strike the opposite&#xD;
wall with feeble force.&#xD;
The Rangers were impatient for the daylight,&#xD;
that they might use their weapons with more&#xD;
fatal results. The darkness melted away before&#xD;
the approaches of the sun. The red light swept'&#xD;
along from  the ruddy east, and revealed the&#xD;
scene of the contest.&#xD;
Several figures were discovered lying upon&#xD;
the earth whose eyes received no light, and&#xD;
whose bodies felt no warmth from the dazzling&#xD;
beams. They had fallen in the conflict ; their&#xD;
ears were deaf to all earthly sounds, and the&#xD;
passions which lad hurried them to their fate&#xD;
were extinguished forever.&#xD;

Parker stood near Wilson reloading his rifle,&#xD;
which he had just discharged. The latter turn-&#xD;
ed to the former with a good-natured smile :&#xD;
"You see that your presentiments amounted&#xD;
to nothing," he remarked.  "I hope you feel&#xD;
quite well now?&#xD;
"It is not noon yet," was the calm reply.&#xD;
"If I should fall, bury -me here, and say to my&#xD;
friends that I did my duty."&#xD;
Parker ceased speaking, and threw his ram-&#xD;
rod upon the ground. - In the very act, of plac-&#xD;
ing a cap upon the tube, a ball struck him upon&#xD;
the breast; he staggered, and Wilson caught&#xD;
him as he was falling.&#xD;
" It's in my lungs," said Parker.&#xD;
'The captain tore open his vest, and the blood&#xD;
was bubbling slowly from a wound in the right&#xD;
breast. Wilson had seen many wounded men,&#xD;
and knew by the peculiar red color of the vital&#xD;
current that it came from the lungs.&#xD;
"Don't mind me," added Parker.    "You&#xD;
can employ yourself better; it's of no use. I&#xD;
knew it would come to this."&#xD;
The kind-hearted ranger did what he could to&#xD;
staunch the blood, but it was a vain attempt.&#xD;
He placed some blankets under him, then re-&#xD;
turned to his post and encouraged the men, who&#xD;
were endeavoring to pick off those who had&#xD;
taken a position in the chapparel. It was cer-&#xD;
tain death to him  who exposed his person ; an&#xD;
unseen messenger was sure to find him.&#xD;
In a short time Wilson was by Parker's side&#xD;
again. He was suffering intense pain ; at every&#xD;
respiration the blood welled forth afresh.&#xD;
" How do you find yourself'?" asked the&#xD;
captain.&#xD;
" It goes hard with me," said Parker.&#xD;
"Do you feel as though you were going'?"&#xD;
continued Wilson, taking his companion's hand.&#xD;
" Sinking fast," murmured Parker.. "Isuf-&#xD;
fer much--I had hoped to have gone easier."&#xD;
"Can I do anything-do you feel prepared ?"&#xD;
added the captain.&#xD;
"'As well prepared, perhaps, as if I had&#xD;
been permitted to lives longer. War is not a&#xD;
trade that fits one for heaven," was the reply,&#xD;
spoken with much effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
" You have fought for your country," said,&#xD;
Wilson.&#xD;
" Yes, in the past;Abut now I am fighting&#xD;
with an enemy that cannot be conquered," re-&#xD;
plied Parker.&#xD;
"The angel of death is strong," said the&#xD;
ranger, wiping his eyes.&#xD;
"Yes, he tears me," added the dying man,&#xD;
painfully convulsed.  "His fingers are at work&#xD;
here-here,"-laying his hand upon his chest.&#xD;
Cameron now drew near, and leaning on the&#xD;
barrel of his rifle, looked sadly'upon the face of&#xD;
his comrade in arms.&#xD;
"You see how it is," said Parker, in a faint&#xD;
voice. "I am paying the last debt; I&#xD;
bound to the unknown country ; the last enemy&#xD;
is pressing hard upon me."&#xD;
"We are sorry to part with you," replied&#xD;
Cameron, solemnly.&#xD;
For a short time the dying ranger was unable&#xD;
to speak, and the angel tugged away at his brave&#xD;
heart. He then raised himself upon his elbow&#xD;
and spoke again:&#xD;
'I'm going on the long march," he added;&#xD;
"a road which all the world must march over.&#xD;
I hear the tattoo of death; I go to my last&#xD;
quarters!  God bless you.--farewell."&#xD;
Parker feebly pressed the hands of his com-&#xD;
panions, his lips moved as if in prayer-he&#xD;
looked at Wilson, smiled, and joined the great&#xD;
army which no man can number.&#xD;
An hour before noon they buried him there,&#xD;
and the sun at his meridian crept in, and his&#xD;
beams lay across the grave.&#xD;
,The enemy having lost many of their I umnf&#xD;
bers, observed much caution in their offensive&#xD;
operations during the day, but upon the ensuing&#xD;
night several determined assaults were made,&#xD;
which were promptly repelled by the Texans.&#xD;
Attempts were also made to fire the fort, but&#xD;
providentially their purpose 'was baflled by,; '&#xD;
shower. Finding that they gained nothing by&#xD;
this mode of warfare, the Mexicans now resolved&#xD;
to reduce the brave band by famine.&#xD;
But little was now done on either side, and&#xD;
the assailants waited patiently for. hunger to&#xD;
perform what mere force of arms couldunot.&#xD;

The Rangers saw with feelings of the deep-&#xD;
est solicitude their little stock of provisions&#xD;
wasting rapidly 'away, and' finally disappear.&#xD;
Their new enemy was now the most formidable.&#xD;
They began to suffer from hunger and thirst,&#xD;
more particularly the latter.&#xD;
"Something must be done," said Captain&#xD;
Wilson one day to Cameron.   " Our brave fel-&#xD;
lows begin to suffer."&#xD;
J41, know it," replied the lieutenant; "and&#xD;
I Piavethought of a plan which may perhaps&#xD;
succeed."'&#xD;
" Lot us hear it," replied the other.&#xD;
It is this," said Cameron.  " When it be-&#xD;
coanes dark to-night, I will leave the fort and&#xD;
endeavor to make my way to the other side of&#xD;
the lake where we left our horses. If fortune&#xD;
favors: me, I shall reach Bexar and bring you&#xD;
relief.  A few shots from our gallant boys would&#xD;
dispirse yonder cowards. like sheep."&#xD;
"'But the great difficulty of your plan is to&#xD;
leave the fort without being shot down or taken.&#xD;
They intend to starve us out-that. is evident ;&#xD;
and' they are watching us as a cat watches a&#xD;
mouse. It 'grieves me to see a brave man haz-&#xD;
ard his life in such a way, for the chances are&#xD;
against you, ten to one."&#xD;
" I am a are that it is a hazardous under-&#xD;
taking, cap 'n; but one will be more likely to&#xD;
succeed th   all of us.  I am resolved to try,"&#xD;
replied Cameron.'&#xD;
"No, I will go. I planned this expedition ;&#xD;
I have led you and our companions in arms into&#xD;
danger, and it shall be mine to make an attempt&#xD;
to extriicate them," said Wilson.&#xD;
I' wil  not consent to it,"'replied Cameron,&#xD;
earnestly. "' I claim the right to incur the risk.&#xD;
Remember Marianna."&#xD;
"I have thought of her," answered the cap-&#xD;
taini  "And there is a name you have spoken&#xD;
wish I have not.ifoi-gotten. "&#xD;
' Yes, Uarmencita ; but her remembrance&#xD;
must not deter me from duty ; it should rather&#xD;
stimulate me' to acts of heroism,'' rejoined the&#xD;
liisenit.&#xD;
~eeiving that Cameron' was fully ibent upon&#xD;
putting his ytlan into execution, Wilson ceased&#xD;
&#xD;
LN BRAVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
to press the subject farther; and when the night&#xD;
came, the former made preparations to go forth&#xD;
on his mission.&#xD;
"This rifle," said Cameron, when ready to&#xD;
make the attempt, " I will leave with you; for&#xD;
if anything should happen to me, I should not&#xD;
like to have it fall into the hands of our ene-&#xD;
mies ; it has'done too. much good service to&#xD;
merit such a fate. Will take this weapon that&#xD;
belonged to poor Parker. Now, my lads, let us&#xD;
shake hands all round, for perhaps we may&#xD;
never meet again."&#xD;
"It is useless to tell you to be cautious,"&#xD;
said the captain, "for .I know you will exer-&#xD;
cise all the prudence that mortal man can. If&#xD;
you shouldn't be successful, and we should&#xD;
never see your face again in time,'what shall we&#xD;
say to Carmencita, should we happen to meet&#xD;
her by some singular chance ?"&#xD;
"That I was true to her to the last ; that&#xD;
will be enough ; she will know what it means,"&#xD;
he replied.&#xD;
"Word for word," responded Wilson.&#xD;
"It is quite dark now and I need delay no&#xD;
longer."&#xD;
The door was opened cautiously; the manly&#xD;
form f Cameron passed out, and all was still.&#xD;
They listened breathlessly, but no sounds came&#xD;
back to tell them of their comrade's fate.  They&#xD;
ventured to hope that he had baffled 'the vigil-&#xD;
ance of the enemy and reached the opposite&#xD;
side of the lake in safety.&#xD;
"I think I can see some object in the water,"&#xD;
said one of the men.&#xD;
" So can I," said Felix.&#xD;
"Where?" asked Wilson.&#xD;
The first speaker indicated the spot with his&#xD;
finger.&#xD;
" I see !" exclaimed the captain, energeti-&#xD;
cally.  " It's Cameron; .he is swimming across&#xD;
the lake. . His rifle is lashed upon his back, and&#xD;
he strikes out boldly ; but I fear this sudden&#xD;
burst of moonlight will betray him."&#xD;
"He is still within gunshot of the enemy,"&#xD;
added the other ; "they could riddle him  with&#xD;
their bullets in a moment."&#xD;
&#xD;
44&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TEXAN BRAVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
"He's a strong swimmer," said the captain,&#xD;
"but I fear the chances are greatly against him..&#xD;
Hark ! I hear the centinela alerta of the senti-&#xD;
nels.  Cameron has gone down; but he breaks&#xD;
water and appears above the surface again. He&#xD;
is yet undiscovered ; I believe he will suc-&#xD;
ceed."&#xD;
The parties watched the brave swimmer until&#xD;
he passed round a 'small headland and was no&#xD;
longer visible. From each.heart there went up&#xD;
a silent yet earnest prayer for his safety.&#xD;
In the long catalogue of human miseries there&#xD;
is none more dreadful than the, agonies of in-&#xD;
tense thirst. The Ranges had already begun&#xD;
to feel its horrors; lips were parched, tongues&#xD;
hot and dry. If they slept, they saw in their&#xD;
dreams delicious streams of water that mocked&#xD;
their thirst.'&#xD;
But necessity is the mother of expedients';&#xD;
with such implements as they had, the men be-&#xD;
gan to dig a hole withintheir narrow precincts.&#xD;
After much labor they bad the pleasure of seeing&#xD;
the excavation gradually fill with dirty looking&#xD;
water; but they drank it-eagerly and with grate-&#xD;
ful hearts.&#xD;
Their-courage now revived, and the enemy&#xD;
heard them cry viva la Texas, with an energy&#xD;
that surprised them. Wilson declared that the&#xD;
muddy liquid was the sweetest water he ever&#xD;
drank.&#xD;
We will not follow the devoted band step by&#xD;
step in the sufferings which they experienced&#xD;
for the next two days. We -will not describe&#xD;
their hollow cheeks and sunken eyes; nor paint&#xD;
the inroads of hunger upon constitutions natu&#xD;
rally robust. But there were no murmuring&#xD;
heard. Stern resolution and defiance was- writ&#xD;
ten in legible characters upon every face. Each&#xD;
spoke hopefully, and no one thought of sur&#xD;
rendering.  Each remembered the fate of Tra&#xD;
vis and Bowie, Crocket and Fannin. When&#xD;
ever an enemy came within range, he instantly&#xD;
covered the sight of a Texan rifle ; and it way&#xD;
next to a miracle if he escaped.&#xD;
On the night of the second day' after the de&#xD;
parture of Cameron, the assailants made a des&#xD;
perate attempt to storm the little fort. Be&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
lieving that the Texans must inevitably be in a&#xD;
poor condition to fight, they resolved to defer&#xD;
the moment of triumph no-'longer.&#xD;
The Kentuckian encouraged his companions,&#xD;
and determined to beat them- back 'or perish.&#xD;
All was done that the most exalted courage could&#xD;
suggest, or the most dogged obstinacy inspire.&#xD;
The men fought with the desperation of de-?&#xD;
pair ; but hunger had enfeebled them, and con-&#xD;
tinued watching, anxiety and  exertion ha,&#xD;
wasted their energies to' an alarming degree.&#xD;
None were more daring or efficient than Feli&#xD;
'He used his master's rifle with great effect, an&#xD;
manifested a spirit of determined bravery.&#xD;
"My friends and comrades," said Wilson&#xD;
"the worst has come. We must either bea&#xD;
them off, or never see another sun rise. The&#xD;
will probably overpower us at last ; but we w&#xD;
die here and leave our bones to bleach beside&#xD;
those of poor Parker. Our countrymen wil&#xD;
not forget us, and the Rangers will avenge o&#xD;
death. It is not so hard a thing to perish figh&#xD;
ing for one's country as cowards imagine. Th&#xD;
good soldier rises superior to pain; he feels b&#xD;
one slight pang and all is over."&#xD;
"They are all around us," said one of th&#xD;
men.   " We can keep them out but little lo&#xD;
ger; they will either burst in upon us, or bur&#xD;
us up."&#xD;
"If the Rangers were only here," replie&#xD;
LWilson.&#xD;
"We'll fight 'em to the death !" exelaime&#xD;
the other.&#xD;
S"Here dey come like de debbil !" said F&#xD;
lix. "Good-by, massa Kentuck."&#xD;
The enemy were now attempting to force tl&#xD;
door. At that instant, the surrounding count&#xD;
- resounded with rifle shots, and the battle-cry&#xD;
- 'the " Lone Star" drowned the shouts of'the&#xD;
- sailants, and found many an echo among t&#xD;
y hills and gorges.&#xD;
s    " 'Spress yerself ! Go yer death !" eni&#xD;
Felix.&#xD;
"The Rangers, by heavens !" exclaim&#xD;
- Wilson. "Thank God, boys, we are saved&#xD;

THE FINALE.&#xD;
&#xD;
E left Walter Ethington running.from&#xD;
the cartel.  Hehad not-,proceeded far,&#xD;
before the cries of the.turnky had'turned out&#xD;
the guard and many of the citizens of Laredo.&#xD;
Our hero was surrounded just as, he reached the.&#xD;
plaza ; for not being acquainted with localities,&#xD;
he had taken the wrong direction. He'prepar-&#xD;
ed for a determined resistance ; but'the guard,&#xD;
were brought suddenly upon him ,at a charge;&#xD;
bayonet, and he was marched     back toy the&#xD;
carcel.&#xD;
As he was conducted to his cell, he met the&#xD;
personage who had attempted his life.  His head&#xD;
was bleeding profusely, and he ,had just been&#xD;
relieved of the "jewelry." He favored our&#xD;
hero with an expressive glance, and took occasion&#xD;
to remark, with a malicious grin:&#xD;
That it was a very rascally world indeed."&#xD;
As it was his turn to triumph, Walter bit his&#xD;
lips with vexation, and made no reply. In a few&#xD;
moments he found himself established in his old&#xD;
quarters, and provided with a new set of irons.&#xD;
much heavier than the former ones. It was use-&#xD;
less to repine, and he bore his disappointment&#xD;
with as much stoicism as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carmencita did not visit him forseveral da&#xD;
and he began to wonder at, her long absen&#xD;
At length she came.&#xD;
"I began to think you had forgotten ia&#xD;
he said, with a smile.&#xD;
"No, senor ; I seldom forget my promise&#xD;
but youbegan to despair, it would seem, and&#xD;
tried to escape.without my assistance," she&#xD;
swered.&#xD;
"I attempted to regain my freedom,"&#xD;
turned Walter; "and I think you will pronoul&#xD;
the trial excusable, when you learn ,that I&#xD;
rowly escaped assassination."&#xD;
Walter then related the particulars of, there&#xD;
cident which led to his futile endeavor to reg&#xD;
his liberty.&#xD;
Carmencita was greatly shocked at hear&#xD;
this, and declared her determination to lay&#xD;
matter before those whose business it 'was1&#xD;
look after such things.&#xD;
" My father has returned to Laredo,""&#xD;
added; " and I have obtained an order fory&#xD;
liberation. 'In a few minute yon will be l&#xD;
from those irons."          '&#xD;

While she was speaking, the smith appeared,&#xD;
snd relieved him of his irons.&#xD;
"I feel like a man again," said Ethington,&#xD;
s he spurned the irons away with his foot, and&#xD;
Felt that he once more had the entire control of&#xD;
is limbs.&#xD;
" I sent information to Bexar by a trusty&#xD;
messenger," continued Carmencita, "concern-&#xD;
ig your condition. The bearer of my message&#xD;
as fortunate enough to meet those who were&#xD;
interested in your fortunes.  They await you a&#xD;
hort distance from Laredo. You will be con--&#xD;

owe you, will, in some measure, be' liqui-&#xD;

"Fair   Carmencita,"  replied - Ethingtorn,&#xD;

Ridgley without reserve.                 p&#xD;
" Your efforts to serve me," said" Walter, in&#xD;
have disarmed me of prejudice. I confess t]&#xD;
Fself your debtor."&#xD;
4The account may be balanced at your lei- sa&#xD;

Walt 4-mrning. to Augustus Henrie, And T&#xD;
mig his small, white hand, " I scarcely know hs&#xD;
&#xD;
what to say. You have served me with singu-&#xD;
lar fidelity and disinterestedness."&#xD;
"But never was so fortunate as to be much&#xD;
of a favorite," replied the youth, with a smile.&#xD;
" I will be frank," rejoined our hero, with a&#xD;
slight change of color.  " I will confess that I&#xD;
did not formerly feel very friendly towards&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" You were inclined to think me rather fop-&#xD;
pish, I believe, Mr. Ethington," returned Au-&#xD;
gustus, -good naturedly.'&#xD;
1' If I were ever so unkind asto do - you in-&#xD;
justice, I.trust you will pardon me; for I regret&#xD;
m y. ingratitude very sincerely " resumed Wal-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
' -ith pleasure, sire- With my smooth,&#xD;
beardless face and slight figure, it was perhaps&#xD;
natural that you should think menwanting in&#xD;
many manly attributes ; we will'let that pass."&#xD;
" I trust it willcure me of the foolish habit&#xD;
of judging by appearances' added our hero.&#xD;
"I cordially hope Rso,"said Ilidgley, earn-&#xD;
estly; "for the very habit has caused all your&#xD;
unhappiness."&#xD;
"Tou allude to Andrea St. Aubert," re-&#xD;
plied Ethington, quickly, and with less cor&#xD;
diality.  "Upon that subject you know' we&#xD;
never agree."&#xD;
"I have;heard that you once loved my cousin&#xD;
Aiidrea," rejoined Augustus.&#xD;
"You heard truly, my good youth. I loved&#xD;
her most"devotedly; but do me the justice to&#xD;
)elive that I would not have broken off the con-&#xD;
nection without sufficient cause."&#xD;
"I have never sought your confidence," said&#xD;
iidgley, " but I ask you now in the most&#xD;
arnest manner, and entreat you by any grati-&#xD;
ude or friendship which you may now be dis-.&#xD;
osed to feel towards me, to speak plainly, and&#xD;
form me why you left my .niece, Andrea, in&#xD;
he abrupt and strange way which you did ?"&#xD;
"I will do as you desire," answered Walter,&#xD;
adly.  " Upon a certain evening I witnessed&#xD;
a interview between her and another lover. I&#xD;
aw them part with mutual tears and embraces.&#xD;
'he sight maddened me past endurance, and I&#xD;
ave not been happy a moment since that fatal&#xD;
&#xD;
r'&#xD;
&#xD;
hour. Can you wonder at my misanthropy-&#xD;
can you reproach me that I am miserable ?"&#xD;
" He can do better than that," replied Au-&#xD;
gustus.  " He can inform you that that young&#xD;
man was her brother, who was to leave her that&#xD;
very hour to return to his class in a northern&#xD;
college."&#xD;
The party had dismounted and were standing&#xD;
near each other. At hearing this unexpected&#xD;
announcement, Walter's cheek grew ashy pale,&#xD;
and he turned his eyes wildly toward Augustus.&#xD;
Springing forward, he, caught him by the arm,'&#xD;
exclaiming':&#xD;
"What is this I 'hear! What strange words&#xD;
would you utter ?'&#xD;
The youth was much agitated, and unable to&#xD;
reply immediately, and Ridgley spoke.&#xD;
"The lad speaks the truth. Andrea St.&#xD;
Aubert is pure as the angels. She was incapa-&#xD;
ble of wronging you  ,Natures like hers are&#xD;
elevated far above such deceit. An enemy has&#xD;
imposed upon you."&#xD;
" Repeat what you have said,", added Wal-&#xD;
ter, shaking the arm of Augustus with consid-'&#xD;
erable impatience. " I would hear it repeated&#xD;
from your lips."&#xD;
" It is true-true as holy writ," stammered&#xD;
Augustus, greatly discomposed by the vehemence&#xD;
of Walter.&#xD;
"And that man was her brother !" cried the&#xD;
latter, flinging the youth from him. " Then I&#xD;
have wronged Andrea St. Aubert past forgive-&#xD;
ness ; my headlong haste has  made me the&#xD;
most unhappy of men. I have been duped-&#xD;
cruelly duped."&#xD;
"You have," resumed Ridgley, " and Wikoff&#xD;
is the man. It was by his agency that you were&#xD;
induced to doubt her and seek proof of her&#xD;
guilt. He sent the false friend to you who led&#xD;
you to the place of the pretended meeting."&#xD;
"It must be so," returned Walter.&#xD;
"It appears to me," said Augustus, "that&#xD;
you were a little too precipitate. You should&#xD;
have seen my cousin Andrea, before you broke&#xD;
off the engagement. A word from her would&#xD;
have prevented all this long protracted misunder-&#xD;
standing."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Very true ; but that time has passed an&#xD;
cannot be recalled. I can only lament my&#xD;
error, and punish the villain who has deceive&#xD;
me by cunning artifices."&#xD;
The revulsion that took place in the mind, 6&#xD;
Walter was very great, as well as unexpected.&#xD;
To hear that Andrea St. Aubert was innocent&#xD;
was indeed a relief; but with the gladness con&#xD;
sequent upon such a discovery, there was, minx&#xD;
led much self-reproach and bitterness. He per&#xD;
ceived that he had been deceived and wronge&#xD;
by an artful rival, and while smarting under th&#xD;
suposd ,grievances, had cruelly wronged on&#xD;
a( dear to him as his own honor.&#xD;
As he rode forward' towards B'exar, accom&#xD;
panied by Ridgley and Augustus, and the half&#xD;
dozen. neigbhdrs who had volunteered to assist&#xD;
the former, lie was a subject of the deepest re;&#xD;
morse.&#xD;
"Did you really feel any friendship for An:.&#xD;
drea ?" asked Augustus, unconcernedly.&#xD;
"That's cool !" said Walter, coldly. " Yo&#xD;
are not very deeply' versed in matters pertain-&#xD;
ing to the affections ?"&#xD;
"I don't care to be, if it makes people se&#xD;
desperate," retorted Augustus.&#xD;
"Wait till your beard .grows," added Wal-&#xD;
ter, with a smile.&#xD;
" That will be a long time," said the youth,&#xD;
passing his hand over his smooth chin.&#xD;
'I think so," answered our hero.&#xD;
On the following day the party were agree'&#xD;
ably surprised by meeting the Texan Raugral&#xD;
who were moving towards Laredo, fully ,deter&#xD;
mined on Walter's release. It was a' leasan&#xD;
incident to our hero, for he felt a. strong ,&#xD;
tachment for Captain Wilson and . ieutenari&#xD;
Cameron,'. as well  as  their' bra e fellows&#xD;
Ethington was rauch affected at theft recital&#xD;
their sufferings, and the friendship theyliar&#xD;
manifested for him.  The order to "right abou&#xD;

The pains of death had already seized him.&#xD;
here was a , dark spot upon his forehead ;-a&#xD;

&#xD;
the sound of the angel's wings, as he conducted&#xD;

"Thus ends the career of a villain !" said&#xD;
Wilson.-&#xD;
"Yes," replied Walter, with a sigh ; "and&#xD;
may God forgive him."&#xD;

than I: ever expected you ;would," returned the&#xD;
ranger,. as they moved away from the spot.&#xD;

"Do you think,.  aid   alterto Augustus&#xD;
Henrie, ', that I'scould have.aniterview with&#xD;
Miss St. Aubert ?  ."&#xD;
"For what purpose,?" he asked.&#xD;
"To.confess my fault, entreat her to pardon&#xD;
me,and sayfarewell. :.Will you .be 1ay mes-&#xD;
senger to Andrea?"&#xD;
"I will;" replied the youth..&#xD;
"This very hour ?" added Walter.&#xD;
1 This.eryhour," said Augustus.&#xD;
Gogthen, rmy good youth, and I will await&#xD;
your return here at the camp. Do not keep me&#xD;
longinsuspense, because my feelings during&#xD;
your absence will not be of the' most enviable&#xD;
kind."&#xD;
Promising to be expeditious, and use all his&#xD;
influence with Andrea, Augustus departed upon&#xD;
his mission: After the lapse of an hour which&#xD;
seemed an' age to Ethington, a colored servant&#xD;
brought a note from  Mr. Ridgley, stating that&#xD;
Miss St. Aubert had reluctantly granted his re-&#xD;
quest ; but begged that the interview might be&#xD;
as brief as ,possible.&#xD;
Our hero directed his steps towards Mr.&#xD;
Ridgley's mansion, agitated by emotions which&#xD;
no man in his senses could have coveted. He&#xD;
felt as a person might be supposed to feel who&#xD;
has committed some great crime, and is on his&#xD;
way to the confessional to unburd1m  his con-&#xD;
science. ~&#xD;
&#xD;
"How   would Andrea receive him? how&#xD;
should he appear in her presence ? was there&#xD;
any hope that she would pardon him ?"&#xD;
To none of these questions could he return a&#xD;
very encouraging answer. The man who fought&#xD;
at San Jacinto trembled violently when he en-'&#xD;
tered the dwelling. of. Mr. Ridgley. He was&#xD;
conducted to the parlor and kept waiting a few&#xD;
minutes in a state of trepidation bordering on&#xD;
insanity.&#xD;
He heard the door yopen and light footsteps&#xD;
advancing; ,h ventured tosraise'his eyes; and&#xD;

deeply I regret; whatahas'happened."&#xD;
"Augustus has tokdiall," replied Andrea,&#xD;
striving to suppress her emotions.&#xD;
"I have suffered much," continued Ething-&#xD;
ton.&#xD;
"I know  it, Walter, and I freely forgive&#xD;
you. You were more sinned against than sin-&#xD;
ning," said Andrea, in a gentle voice:&#xD;
"I thank you from the deepest fountains of&#xD;
my heart for this condescension-!" exclaimed&#xD;
Walter.  "You will forgive me, then ?".&#xD;
"For the sake of Augustus," saidrAndrea.&#xD;
"But your kindness is limited to }a certain&#xD;
extent ; it leaves me nothing to hope from your&#xD;
love, and I did not expect it," resumed Walter.&#xD;
"To please Augustus," added- Andrea.&#xD;
"Dare I believe what I hear !" he exclaim-&#xD;
ed, advancing and taking Andrea by the hand.&#xD;
"To -please Augustus," repeated Andrea,&#xD;
with ' smile.&#xD;
The next moment-no, that will not- do ;&#xD;
the blushes of my heroine shall be spared. I have&#xD;
no right to describe what ensued. Who will&#xD;
dare embrace the mistress of his heart after a&#xD;
&#xD;
reconciliation, if it is to be put in print and pass&#xD;
before the optics of an hundred thousand read-&#xD;
ers! It is not fair ; such moments of 'apture&#xD;
belong wholly to those who experience them.'&#xD;
"As you have done so much to please&#xD;
Augustus,",said Walter, after an interv T" of&#xD;
expressive silence, "be good enough to ring&#xD;
the bell and send for him, that I may 'thank&#xD;
him as he deserves."&#xD;
Andrea wiped the happy tears from her eyes,&#xD;
and left the room. . In a short time Augustus&#xD;
and'Mr. Ridgley appeared.&#xD;
nou I have had an excellent advocate,"&#xD;
sad  Walter, embracing the youth warmly.&#xD;
y Through your intercession, I have been made&#xD;
the happiest of men."&#xD;
"It's a pity I am such a dandy," rejoined&#xD;
Augustus.'&#xD;
" I thought you had forgiven and forgotten&#xD;
that," added Walter, with a smile. "Where's&#xD;
Andreaf I wish to see you both together,"&#xD;
"You shall," said Augustus; and instantly&#xD;
throwing off his cap and outer garments, our&#xD;
hero saw both Augustus and Andrea in one.&#xD;
"Andrea St. Aubert !" exclaimed Ethington,&#xD;
recoiling with surprise. "Is it possible that I&#xD;
have been so stupid !"&#xD;
.'Spress yerself ! promulgate-luminate de&#xD;
idee !"  cried Felix, rushing into the room.&#xD;
"Yah, yah ! heah, heah !"&#xD;
,Walter turned towards Ridgley and attempt.&#xD;
ed to speak ; but his heart was too full.&#xD;
 She is unequalled," said Ridgley.&#xD;
"I feel that I am unworthy of her," replied&#xD;
Walter, greatly wrought upon by the singular&#xD;
denouement.&#xD;
"But tog;'please Augustus," said Andrea,&#xD;
archly.&#xD;
"Yes," replied Walter, earnetly, "to please&#xD;
Augustus, I would undertake a pilgrimage to&#xD;
Jerusalem."&#xD;
It is unnecessary," added Ridgley.&#xD;
I can now understand how, a certain chain&#xD;
was restored to me," added Walter.&#xD;
"I was her agent in that transaction," an&#xD;

[1ROM TILE FLAG OF OUR UNION.]&#xD;
Sw 5ERIL COTTAGE.&#xD;
BY JOSEPH C. BAKER.&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
&#xD;
ONE of the dearest reminiscences that comes&#xD;
through the long vista of the shadowy past, is&#xD;
the remembrance of Sweetbrier Cottage, and its&#xD;
dear old inmate, Cousin Patty, as she was fa-&#xD;
miliarly styled by the circle of us young ones,&#xD;
who loved to congregate within its loved pre-&#xD;
cincts, and listen to the tales of years agone&#xD;
that our kind hostess was ever willing to relate;&#xD;
and many times have I caught myself with wide-&#xD;
ly distended eyes and gaping mouth, drinking&#xD;
in, what I then thought marvellous accounts,&#xD;
but which I have since discovered to be stern&#xD;
reality.&#xD;
Methinks even now I behold the kind old&#xD;
lady ensconced in her high-backed arm-chair, and&#xD;
presenting by no means, a small pattern of good-&#xD;
natured humanity, for she completely filled up.&#xD;
&#xD;
her throne, which was of ample dimensions ; and&#xD;
as it was moved out on the porch in the- calm&#xD;
summer twilight, with us grouped around our&#xD;
empress, I thought no place could be more envi-&#xD;
able, and I am sure we have never since tasted&#xD;
such unalloyed happiness as in those dear days&#xD;
of our innocent childhood.&#xD;
To describe that group as it then appeared,&#xD;
would We almost impossible, for all were of such&#xD;
different dispositions and appearance ; but an&#xD;
universal harmony always prevailed. The lead-&#xD;
er in all our pranks, the wildest, most unaccoun-&#xD;
table little creature in all that little band, was&#xD;
Nelliiaywood, a black-eyed, curly-headed girl&#xD;
of thirteen summers, who was scarcely ever known&#xD;
to proceed with any degree of studied propriety,&#xD;
ps a skip, jump, or perfect run was always pre-&#xD;

ferred by her to a steady walk ; she was a&#xD;
merry-hearted, sportive), fawn-like creature-but&#xD;
ala! the world has sadly tamed her now ; and&#xD;
the very' opposite to, though her firmest friend,&#xD;
was the gentle, lady-like Mary White, whose&#xD;
dark, hazel eyes were at times lit up with such&#xD;
a glow of enthusiasm as was totally at variance&#xD;
with her usual calm, steady system of deport-&#xD;
ment. She was continually trying to bring the&#xD;
giddy Nelly into some degree of subjection, and&#xD;
as often failed ; for as wellmight she have sought&#xD;
to chain the fitful breeze that came with' cca-&#xD;
sional wild bursts through the bower'of 'eet-&#xD;
brier, that gave the name to our 'littleaiirylik&#xD;
cottage, whose walls, as they gleamed here and&#xD;
there through the twining vines, were always as&#xD;
white and spotless as the driven snow.&#xD;
Carrie Lane and her twin sister,' Lizzie, were&#xD;
often there too, and the sweetest little darling.&#xD;
in the world, and the pet of Cousin Patty and&#xD;
the whole band, was Lilly Raymond, the tiniest&#xD;
little mortal for twelve years that could well be&#xD;
imagined, andsright appropriately was she called&#xD;
Lilly, her clear white complexion, light blue&#xD;
eyes and sunny hued locks, could be compared&#xD;
to nothing else than that pure and gentle flower ;&#xD;
she appeared too good for this dark world of sin,&#xD;
and by far too frail to battle with the rough&#xD;
waters of life ; and it cannot be wondered that&#xD;
she was our darling, and always claimed the fa-&#xD;
yorite seat on the low stool at Cousin Patty's&#xD;
knee, with-the old lady's left hand playing with&#xD;
her soft silky curls, while with her right she&#xD;
made from time to time such appropriate mo-&#xD;
tions, as was to us the very perfection of elocu-&#xD;
tionary evolutions. Lil's brother Frank and&#xD;
myself were seldom  absent from' the circle,&#xD;
though the girls, especially Mary; often throat-&#xD;
ened to drive us forth, if we did not ieave off&#xD;
our rough ways and teasing tricks, lbut we al-&#xD;
rays had a: zealous champion in the frolicsome&#xD;
Nell, who would often join us against her gen-&#xD;
tler companions, though one coaxing look from&#xD;
Cousin Patty was sufficient to still our most&#xD;
boisterous mirth, and through her influence the&#xD;
boys were allowed to remain.        .     .&#xD;
The cottage was situated ir the nuidst of on~e&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
of the loveliest valleys of 'Penn, surrounded&#xD;
with its pretty garden, large fields of grin,&#xD;
grass and wide-spreading orchards of the choic-&#xD;
est fruit, while beside it was the little white&#xD;
barn with its red roof and tiny dove cot, Brin-&#xD;
dle and Cherry chewing their cud in the ample&#xD;
barnyard, and the turkeys; chickens and ducks&#xD;
keeping up an almost deafening cackling when-&#xD;
ever old Dinah distributed their evening food,-&#xD;
making ierself'scaacely less noise than the feath-&#xD;
ered recipients of her: bounty.&#xD;

Our-merry band now, as usual at this hour,&#xD;
approached the cottage, and Nell, who had been&#xD;
gaily chatting all the way down the lane, but&#xD;
keeping her hands behind her, suddenly leaped&#xD;
up to Dinah, as she was closing the barnyard&#xD;
door, and heaped upon her woolly pate an enor-&#xD;
mous wreath of oak' leaves ind cabbage roses,&#xD;
and she, full of surprise, blushing no doubt, if&#xD;
we could only see through her ebony complex-&#xD;
ion, with a low courtesy, wished us "good eben-&#xD;
in', young folks," and with her towering crown,&#xD;
walked every -majestically towards the dairy,&#xD;
greeted with a wild burst of merriment from us&#xD;
all, and even her mistress stood atthe little gate&#xD;
shaking her fat sides with a hearty fit of&#xD;
laughter,&#xD;
Instead of being angry, the good natured&#xD;
negress soon came forth with a large vessel of&#xD;
milk and cups, still bearing the crown, and de-&#xD;
claring herself " de queen ob night," and with&#xD;
-her shining black countenance illuminated with&#xD;
her white teeth and rolling eyeballs, she was&#xD;
certainly  a fit emblem   of the empress of&#xD;

&#xD;
much at home as in our own cottage.. The time&#xD;
passed on in making and receiving visits, at-&#xD;
tending places of amusement, and all the rou-&#xD;
tine of a city life, which, being new to me, I&#xD;
enjoyed with all possible zest.&#xD;
"Among the most frequent visitors at my un-&#xD;
cle's house, was Harry Campbell, a young law-&#xD;
yer of rare talents, amiable disposition, prepos-&#xD;
sessing appearance, and in my eyes, really hand-&#xD;
some. Ever gentle and obliging, he performed&#xD;
with willingness every little act of kindness we&#xD;
requested. He was on very familiar terms with&#xD;
the whole family, and being the first young&#xD;
gentleman into whose company I had been so&#xD;
often thrown, and having such ample means of&#xD;
judging his qualities, it is no wonder that he&#xD;
found favor in the sight of a girl of the age of&#xD;
seventeen years.&#xD;
"The happiness I always experienced in his&#xD;
absence, the longing for his return, gradually&#xD;
unfolded to me the knowledge that I loved ; the&#xD;
sensation was new to me, and perfectly inde-&#xD;
scribable. I would hurry over this part of my&#xD;
narrative, for in your happy innocence, you&#xD;
kitow not the tender feeling, and may you nev-&#xD;
er know it to your sorrow. I will not tell how&#xD;
my love for him was to my heart what the sun-&#xD;
shine, dew and gentle zephyrs are to the open-&#xD;
ing blossoms ; how the delicate leaves of the&#xD;
bud unrolled themselves 'neath his smile, and&#xD;
gave forth their fragrance for him alone. Now I&#xD;
had indeed commenced to live ; I was a woman,&#xD;
a trusting, loving woman, but 0, how the dream&#xD;
of my heart faded !&#xD;
&#xD;
"That I was beloved in return, I could not&#xD;
doubt; his every glance seemed to speak in that&#xD;
language to my heart, but never being alone,&#xD;
we had not an opportunity of expressing in&#xD;
words our true feelings.  I soon'made a new&#xD;
discovery ; my cousin also loved Harry-a wild,&#xD;
passionate love had taken possession of her heart&#xD;
which she could not control, nor even conceal;&#xD;
a change came between us. Before we were&#xD;
confidants in 'everything ; now each strove to&#xD;
hide from the other the only thing she had to&#xD;
confide ; but Anna soon guessed my secret, and&#xD;
jealousy -sprang up in her heart, and she put&#xD;
forth all the little arts of which she was mistress&#xD;
to win his love, and not possessing a disposition&#xD;
with which the concealment of her passion was&#xD;
compatible, I soon knew all, and thinking that&#xD;
I might be mistaken in regard to his feelings&#xD;
towards me, and that Anna was the favored&#xD;
one, I strove as far as I was able, to crush the&#xD;
all-absorbing power of my first love, and avoid-&#xD;
ed intruding myself upon their presence, and&#xD;
turned my attention to others.  Harry, observ-&#xD;
ing my reserved and backward deportment,-&#xD;
deemed me cold and unmindful of him; and be-&#xD;
ing left alone more frequently with Anna, he&#xD;
was not long in finding out the feelings with&#xD;
vhich she regarded him, and which she did not&#xD;
endeavor to conceal. Seeing that he had wound&#xD;
himself around her heart, and as it is so pleas-&#xD;
ing to know that we are beloved, which knowl-&#xD;
edge seldom fails in some degree to win a re-&#xD;
turn, his heart warmed towards her with the&#xD;
strongest friendship.&#xD;
&#xD;
CIALPTER II&#xD;
&#xD;
"B   the hour of trial was at hand.  Harry&#xD;
had received letters from the south, pertaining&#xD;
to pressing business that required his immediate&#xD;
presence. He was alone with my cousin and me&#xD;
on the evening that the uminons' reached him,&#xD;
and told us of his inte ded journey, and that&#xD;
the period of his return Was indefinite. I can-&#xD;
not describe the effect the unwelcome "informa-&#xD;
tion had upon us; it came so suddenly that we&#xD;
had no time for reflection, and this was his part-&#xD;
ing visit. Anna burst into tears, and I, not&#xD;
wishing to expose myself, and endeavoring to&#xD;
crush the rising emotions, after a few hurried&#xD;
words of regret, arose and.left the apartment.&#xD;
The proceedings of that hour sealed my destiny.&#xD;
Anna, unasked, made a full confession of what&#xD;
should have been her heart's dearest treasured&#xD;
secret, and he, thinking me cold and haughty,&#xD;
from my studied indifference, and seeing the ex-&#xD;
tent to which matters had gone, made her a&#xD;
proposal of his hand, and    of course, was&#xD;
ecepted.&#xD;
" This I learned when I had summoned sufli-&#xD;
dient courage to return to the presence of him I&#xD;
&#xD;
loved so profoundly- --but he had gone, and I&#xD;
should see him no more, until he returned to&#xD;
wed another.&#xD;
'; The dark, wild thoughts that took posses-&#xD;
sion of my breast in that next hour, can never&#xD;
be known ; my sweetest dream was fading, my&#xD;
brightest hope gone; and the light of life seemed&#xD;
almost extinguished. While I laid motionless,&#xD;
burning thoughts were ryhing through niy&#xD;
heartait seemed almost bursting, and I became&#xD;
so oppressed that I could scardely b the; a&#xD;
flood of tears brought some relic, and . I was&#xD;
enabled to consider with more cal ness acnd rea-&#xD;
son what course to pursue. I det mined from&#xD;
that hour to hide every trace of m unhappy&#xD;
love. I felt that I must have been m taken,&#xD;
and that he had never regarded me with warm-&#xD;
er sentiments than those prompted iby friendship ;&#xD;
and my sincere wishes being for hia happiness, I&#xD;
vowed to live for its promotion, even at the sac-&#xD;
rifice of my own peace of mind.&#xD;
" I came that evening from my own little&#xD;
sanctuary, a changed being--I seemed to have&#xD;
lived years of sorrow in that brief hour, but the&#xD;

greatest fury of the storm was passed, and a&#xD;
momentary calm had in a measure succeeded.&#xD;
I ascep led to the parlor, and seeing Anna with&#xD;
a face radiant with hope, although fairly shud-&#xD;
dering, I approached, and embracing her, wish-&#xD;
ed her joy. She gazed long and earnestly into&#xD;
my countenance. .I quailed not beneath that&#xD;
searching glance, and seemingly satisfied, she&#xD;
pressed me to her bosom and wept tears of very&#xD;
happiness.S&#xD;
" How strangely, our hearts contrasted, as&#xD;
we stood that night clasped in each other's arms;&#xD;
her head was resting upon my breast, and I&#xD;
wonder my beating heart did not -whisper the&#xD;
sad tale of my sufferings in her ear. The same&#xD;
cause had occasioned such widely different ef-&#xD;
fects in our bosoms-her's brimming full of joy,&#xD;
gladness and delightful, rapturous anticipation-&#xD;
mine of woe, darkness and -blighted hope,-not&#xD;
one ray to inspire me with even a tolerable fu-&#xD;
ture ; how well I sustained myself in that try-&#xD;
ing hour, I cannot tell, but from that time for-&#xD;
ward we were the fondest friends. Anna told&#xD;
me her every hope, which I endeavored to en-&#xD;
courage, for I would not have had another&#xD;
heart seared like mine, for worlds.-&#xD;
"The months rolled rapidly by, and had&#xD;
numbered nearly a year, before Harry returned,&#xD;
and when he did, themeeting with his betroth-&#xD;
ed was not as warm as I thought it should have&#xD;
been, but she was happy in his presence, and&#xD;
saw not the want of affection. I had schooled&#xD;
myself for the first meeting with him, and not&#xD;
daring to trust myself alone, it was in the pres-&#xD;
ence of the whole fanuiy ; and he little thought,&#xD;
as I carelessly, though in a friendly manner,&#xD;
welcomed him back, that my heart was crushed&#xD;
and hopeless. The day was fixed for the mar-&#xD;
riage, -and I had consented to be Anna's brides-&#xD;
maid. ,I decked her in her bridal robes, and&#xD;
thought ahe never looked more lovely, her eyes&#xD;
beaming with the joy that reigned in her heart,&#xD;
and governed her every action. A  wreath of&#xD;
orange buds clasped the veil that fell over&#xD;
her snowy, well rounded shoulders, and shaded&#xD;
her dark curls ; a fragrant bouquet was fastened&#xD;
at her bosom, and-the rich perfume of the deli-&#xD;
&#xD;
R COTTAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
cate flowers was not sweeter than the hopes&#xD;
that animated the heart beneath.   All was&#xD;
ready, and I approached with them the altar at&#xD;
which my happiness was to be sacrificed ; the&#xD;
guests were all excitement, the rustling of silks&#xD;
and fluttering of fans was by me unnoticed.,&#xD;
I mechanically performed the office of withdraw.&#xD;
ing the glove and other customary duties of the&#xD;
bridesmaid, and was nerving myself for the last&#xD;
effort. The ceremony proceeded, Anna plight.&#xD;
ed her vows in calm, happy tones, but harry,&#xD;
as his eyes met mine, which were fixed earnestly&#xD;
upon him, faltered, and replied in a low confus-&#xD;
ed tone. My suspicions were verified. I could&#xD;
bear up no longer, and as the nuptial benedie.&#xD;
tion was being delivered, I sank upon the ground&#xD;
before him Who had implanted such a thorn&#xD;
within my breast, and he alone suspected the&#xD;
real cause of my fainting; the others ascribed it&#xD;
to the close air and want of ventilation, and re-&#xD;
moving me-to a carriage, bore me with the par.&#xD;
ty home.&#xD;
"It was now no home for me. I returned to&#xD;
my own cottage, and in the quiet duties of a&#xD;
country life endeavored to find the balm to heal&#xD;
my 'wounded spirit, and in a degree succeeded,&#xD;
though my lightness and elasticity of spirits had&#xD;
vanished, and my kind anxious mother would&#xD;
shake her head and say she knew Patty would&#xD;
not be benefited by her city residence.&#xD;
"I had been but a short time home, when&#xD;
Anna wrote and earnestly entreated me to&#xD;
come -to her, she was unhappy ; I could&#xD;
not resist her pleading, and I went, though I&#xD;
fain would have remained at home. When I&#xD;
arrived, I saw all things were not right ; she&#xD;
shed tears as she embraced me, but they were&#xD;
not of joy, for a shade of mournful sadness ha&#xD;
settled on her countenance, and I saw her sn&#xD;
ticipations had not been realized. She uttere&#xD;
not a word of complaint, but my woman's nature&#xD;
divined the cause, and from the bottom of a&#xD;
heart I pitied her.-&#xD;
" In his home where a husband should fin&#xD;
his only true happiness, Harry was discontent&#xD;
-the steady love of Anna: was a reproach t&#xD;
him, for he could not return it, and he felt tha&#xD;

&#xD;
he had basely deceived her ; and such being the&#xD;
case, he mingled more with the companions, in&#xD;
whose company, by reason of his active life, he&#xD;
was ,thrown; the intoxicating glass had been&#xD;
raised to'his lips, and he was a marked victim&#xD;
of intemperance.  How many a poor weak&#xD;
youth has yielded to the tempter beneath the&#xD;
guise of ruby wine, and having been entangled&#xD;
in the meshes of the lurking snare, gone down&#xD;
to an outcast's grave. .,0, when will the accurs-&#xD;
ed demon, which is laying waste our beautiful&#xD;
land, be cast out from among us, and our hap-&#xD;
piest hearthstones cease to be made desolate'?&#xD;
Widowed and broken hearts, blighted youth and&#xD;
withered, decrepit, gray-headed, old age sinking&#xD;
slowly into the tomb, are crying oft to Heaven&#xD;
for vengeance against the foul, hydra-headed&#xD;
monster. How my heart bled for Harry and&#xD;
poor Anna too,-she never murmured, but tried&#xD;
to win his love by her devoted attention.&#xD;
"One evening Harry came home earlier than&#xD;
usual and found me alone; it was the first&#xD;
time since his fatal marriage,-and dropping on&#xD;
his knees, he told me of the deep love he was&#xD;
consumed with, and that I was the object. I&#xD;
endeavored not to listen, and tried toi rise and&#xD;
leave his presence ; but I was 'spell-bound, and&#xD;
had not the power to move, till summoning all&#xD;
my energy when he begged that I should fly&#xD;
with him and be happy, I repelled the insulting&#xD;
proposal, told how ardently I had loved him,&#xD;
and when he became another's how I had crush-1&#xD;
ed that feeling, which he should also have done,&#xD;
and turned his attention to her who was his&#xD;
proper care, and had the only right to claim:his&#xD;
affection; and since he had plighted those vowsI&#xD;
which could not be broken without the great sin&#xD;
of foulperjury, he had highly outraged my feel-&#xD;
ings by the utterance of such a proposition. I I&#xD;
hastily left his presence, and without a word to f&#xD;
Anna as to the true cause of my abrupt depart-'&#xD;
ure, I started home on the following day. 't&#xD;
" The knowledge that my love had been re- f&#xD;
turned, was soothing to my heart ; and though s&#xD;
it had been so unfortunately interrupted, I re-&#xD;
&#xD;
R   CTTAG.                                99&#xD;
mained true to him, who alone had ever been&#xD;
able to call forth that affection without which I&#xD;
could never marry.  I never saw him      again,&#xD;
until I was summoned toeconsole his broken-&#xD;
hearted widow, and look upon his disfigured&#xD;
corpse arrayed for its last resting-place;long&#xD;
and passionately I mourned athis untimely end.&#xD;
I felt that it was not sinful to allow my love to&#xD;
break forth in weeping, now that his spirit had&#xD;
winged its way from earth; and I sympathized&#xD;
with Anna as none but I could do. Weprayed&#xD;
together, and scalding tears coursed down, our&#xD;
cheeks, for we had both loved with ardor and&#xD;
truth.&#xD;
"I remained long enough to see my poor&#xD;
cousin and her little one follow the husband to&#xD;
his narrow bed, and once more returned to my&#xD;
country home, never to leave it till the ,angel of&#xD;
death shouldmsummon me to traverse that dark&#xD;
valley over which he holds dominion."&#xD;
Wiping a tear from her eye, Cousin Patty&#xD;
earnestly entreated us for her sake to think&#xD;
kindly of pld maids, and never to join in the&#xD;
uncharitable slanders against them; for, al.&#xD;
though so often sour and crabbed, we know not&#xD;
the blighted hearts that have sustained that title,&#xD;
nor the sorrows and trials they may have nobly&#xD;
borne.&#xD;
We all readily assented, and if she was a&#xD;
specimen, they must be the dearest old creatures&#xD;
in existence. Mary White decidedly averred&#xD;
that she would never marry, but live a life of&#xD;
single blessedness; and Nell declared that no&#xD;
masculine should ever tame her. Why, the de-&#xD;
ceitful creatures were not worth wasting a&#xD;
thought upon. When we arose to depart night&#xD;
had thrown around us her dusky mantle; and&#xD;
having each culled a bouquet of Cousin Patty's&#xD;
flowers, which we thought always had a sweeter&#xD;
fragrance than our own, we proceeded on our&#xD;
way, lighted by the flashing fairy-like lanterns of&#xD;
he fireflies, that, like so many stars dropped&#xD;
from the blue expanse, gleamed from the road-&#xD;
ide thicket and hedge.&#xD;
It was the last time that undivided grup mt&#xD;

Sweetbrier Cottage-; the: ;next day Carrie&#xD;
Lane-was taken ill, and ere the winter folded&#xD;
around his snowy mantle, she fled to her'angel&#xD;
home ; and thus was the first link of. our little&#xD;
chain of friends severed.  And as the years&#xD;
wore away, we one after another parted, till&#xD;
that band snow widely scattered.&#xD;
Mary White, in spite of her proposed old&#xD;
maidenhood, married our Lilly's brother Frank ;&#xD;
and Nell, after running a brilliant and fashion-&#xD;
able season in New York, - married a. dashing&#xD;
.rake, and is now, sadly tamed.&#xD;
Lizzie Lane also became a steady matron, and&#xD;
&#xD;
our beautiful Lilly is still a maid; tall, grace.&#xD;
ful, and handsomer if possible than in her child.&#xD;
hood, and not half so frail in appearance; and&#xD;
though she still visits Cousin Patty, and tells&#xD;
her that she is going to follow her example,.yet&#xD;
there is some one who is laboring to coax her&#xD;
out of that notion, and will one day persuade&#xD;
her to embark upon the sea of matrimony; and&#xD;
he fondly cherishes the idea that he will be suc-&#xD;
cessful, and has sly visions of Lilly as a charm-&#xD;
ing little wife, and those scores of nothings&#xD;
which, all combined, lift two fond hearts united&#xD;
in wedded bliss, to the height of mortal felicity.&#xD;
