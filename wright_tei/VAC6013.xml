                  <head>CHAPTER I.—PUTTERRUM.</head>
                  <p>In the harbor of a certain small city in the Indian Seas (the capital of a
                     petty fifteenth-rate Asiatic power, which I shall call the port of Putterrum,
                     for the reason, that the incidents which are herein narrated are of such recent
                     occurrence that to give the real name would be to incur the danger of consular
                     investigation,) lay at anchor a small whaling bark of something-above three
                     hundred tons burthen.</p>
                  <p>She was of the class known to the whaling fraternity as a "plum-puddener," i.e.
                     a vessel cruising on a short voyage for sperm whales, though they do not stand
                     on it as a specialty, but will "lower" for anything of the cetaceous species,
                     from a "right whale" to a grampus. These vessels cruise in the Atlantic and
                     Indian Oceans, and the one mentioned had just arrived from the vicinity of the
                     Seychelles, stopping into Bourbon Island on her way down to the present port.
                     Here she was to sell a little oil for port expenses, and then shape her course
                     for another whaling ground.</p>
                  <p>She had a number of men among her crew who had "shipped by the run" as it is
                     called, to this port, and who were told at the time of shipping that the vessel
                     was going "right down to Putterrum without delay." That, however, did not at
                     all prove to be the case; but, on the contrary the captain cruised about for
                     whales, and made the "run" by so doing six months from Cape Town to Putterrum—a
                     passage that should not have taken, under ordinary circumstances, longer than
                     several weeks. This course had caused a deal of mutinous conduct upon the part
                     of the men thus misled; and it reached its climax when the mate announced that
                     they would remain only twenty-four hours in port and then go down the coast,
                     and that no one of the crew was to be permitted to go on shore while at
                     Putterrum. There was some specious reason given, in connection with the
                     quarantine regulations, but the real object was to keep the Cape Town man as
                     they were called,<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC6013-00000002" /> for another cruise. If
                     they had been old sailors, such a course would not have been attempted, as it
                     would have caused a general fight; but these were green hands, just out from
                     New Bedford, and had been left in the hospital at Cape Town sick with scarlet
                     fever, which had broken out on board of the outward-bound whaleman on which
                     they originally shipped. These men, eleven in all, were thus rid of the onerous
                     prospect of going on with the ship just at the time when they were most
                     thoroughly homesick. They were all, with one or two exceptions, of a
                     respectable class of their kind, rough young men or boys, with half-learned
                     trades, and a proclivity for roving and adventure.</p>
                  <p>After the bark had been properly moored and everything made snug, the mate
                     called out:</p>
                  <p>"Come aft here, all of you beach comers;" to which the steward, a sort of
                     privileged darkey, added in a lower tone:</p>
                  <p>"Gladiators, killers and Canton-wreckers."</p>
                  <p>The men came aft as far as the waist, when the mate, taking the main hatch for
                     a rostrum, delivered a specimen of salt-water oratory, thus:</p>
                  <p>"Now, then, you fellers expects to git your discharge here; but you've hearn me
                     say that it's agin the quarantine laws. The quarantine laws is mighty strict
                     here—mighty strict. It's also agin the laws of the islant for men to be
                     discharged here without a permit. Now, how's you fellows gwine to git a permit?
                     And then if you got a permit, they'd pick you up agin after sixty days. You
                     ain't passengers, you ain't citizens, you ain't nothin' but jist men aboard a
                     ship; and I don't see anything you can do but just stop where you are till we
                     git to some port where a white man's a white man."</p>
                  <p>This produced a very audible growl, and the mate proceeded:</p>
                  <p>"Now, the cap'n's willin' to do the square thing by you fellers, and is
                     willin', if all come up and sign to go the voyage round to Singapore, he'll
                     discharge you there, and you'll git the one-hundredth lay, and he won't charge
                     agin you what you've had from the slop-chist; and that's the best chance that
                     men over did have, fixed as you fellers is fixed."</p>
                  <p>"We don't sign no more dockerments."</p>
                  <p>"Now look here men"—</p>
                  <p>"We wan't our discharge; and we'll have it in some fashion or other."</p>
                  <p>"Now hear to reasonable talk," continued the mate. "If you fellers will jist
                     sign as I told ye, and make up your minds to go with the ship, it will all come
                     right; and the cap'n's willin' to give all—all hands—every other day ashore for
                     a week. He'll keep the ship on expense of port charges here for a week, to give
                     you all liberty. If you don't do that, you won't git a site to put your foot
                     ashore at all, none of ye; we'll go to sea to-morrer."</p>
                  <p>The remainder of the crew, thus made interested in the issue which was thus
                     artfully contrived, urged the refractory ones to sign as the mate offered; but
                     all stoutly refused, and amid the various noises of an angry disputation the
                     mate proceeded with his harangue.</p>
                  <p>"What do you fellers want to stop ashore in this rotten little town fur? I'd
                     like to know; I raly should. There's nothin' here but yaller-fever, thieves and
                     scoundrels of all sorts. Why, the most respectable business men here is mostly
                     all busted-up merchants from England and the States, and swindlers of one sort
                     and another."</p>
                  <p>"Old Jinks, you needn't blow any more, we aint going to stay another day,"
                     shouted one.</p>
                  <p>"Well, go your way, go your way, I've done all I can do;" said the orator,
                     waving his hand, which was of the general form of a boxing glove. "Go your way,
                     I've done all I can do; but you'll have to stop aboard this ship; and you mout
                     as well be cheerful about it;" concluded Mr. Jinks, walking aft.</p>
                  <p>In about an hour afterward there was an attempt to seize the bow boat, which
                     ended in a fight and the defeat of the Cape Town men, as they were outnumbered
                     greatly. I came on deck, and saw them driven back, and taking refuge in the
                     forecastle, where they remained till I left the ship. I had taken passage in
                     the vessel at Bourbon; and during the short stay on board had become somewhat
                     acquainted with the American men; the others, being a hard set of various
                     nationalities, I had no speech with whatever.</p>
                  <p>My baggage being light, a straw valise with one change of outer clothes, four
                     shirts, a meerschaum pipe, a revolver and lorgnette, I had nothing to do but
                     get into a boat and go on shore, as soon as the captain returned from the
                     custom house with the permit, which the mate seemed to think, or rather to make
                     those inexperienced green hands think, was almost as hard to obtain as an
                     appointment to West Point.</p>
                  <p>I made a pretext to go forward as the boat came alongside, and said in a low
                     voice to those in the forecastle:</p>
                  <p>"I'll see that you get ashore; don't attempt any high-handed measures."</p>
                  <p>I was soon on the beach. The great capital of one of the trumpery seven by-nine
                     principalities which abound in the lost corners of the Oriental world, though
                     it glistened white and picturesquely from the anchorage, was a very
                     dilapidated, or, as the mate termed it, "rotten," collection of stucco huts,
                     with narrow streets choked up with fruit stands, bullock carts, thieves,
                     desperadoes and abandoned women of all hues—a very whited sepulchre indeed. The
                     few establishments of anything like a commercial character lined the beach at
                     the extreme end of the town; and were merely a solemn cordon of low, broad tile
                     or thatched-roof ware-houses; holding in some remote corner a matted space,
                     screened with mats from the interior merchandise, and containing a desk or two,
                     a safe, and a punkah swinging overhead to circulate the air at midday. There
                     were a few bazarrs of a civilized appearance, containing a very rich display of
                     laces, European and Indian, with other costly fabrics that so interest and
                     gladden the ladies of Christendom, but the most of them contained merely a
                     jumbled collection of red and striped silks, bandanas, turbans, pistols,
                     carbines, cimitars, krisses, daggers, and such murderous cutlery, chiefly of
                     Chinese manufacture. Back and above the town rose the dingy walls of the
                     palace, a great rambling building, containing the government office in the
                     basement story; also the audience halls and court rooms. A mosque in the centre
                     of the town raised its light-house looking minarets above the sea of
                     dilapidated roofs; and from these the muezzens drawled out several times a day
                     a very lugubrious invitation to the inhabitants to perform their devotions. I
                     wandered about in search of the American consular agent—the post not being of
                     sufficient importance for a full consul—and after some trouble found him living
                     in a rookery of a building in the vicinity of the "palace."</p>
                  <p>After obtaining money on a letter of credit, I investigated the subject of the
                     detention of the Cape Town men, and ascertained that there would be no
                     difficulty in the way of their release, provided they had American protections
                     (a document furnished all seamen on leaving the United States). These they had,
                     though the papers were in possession<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6013-00000003" /> of
                     the captain. After some further conversation the agent said he would have them
                     released forthwith, though as the mate had stated, they would have to ship
                     again in sixty days, or be taken in charge by the Aga of the port, unless they
                     obtained a citizen's permit.</p>
                  <p>The end of the matter was, that they were on shore the next day, wandering
                     about, with no settled purpose other than to make a 'raise,' as they termed it,
                     in some way, and then ship on board a vessel bound for the "States" if one
                     could be found. They were exceedingly grateful to me for my interference in
                     their behalf, and were ready to follow any lead I might decide upon if they
                     were wanted so to do.</p>
                  <p>"We'll stick to you, Doc,' through fire and smoke," was the general sentiment,
                     and at first I was rather afraid that they were terribly in earnest in this and
                     similar remarks, as there was very little money in the party, and that little
                     likely to go fast; and then I should have the alternative of turning my back
                     upon fellow-countrymen, needy and in a strange land, or furnishing them with
                     means from day to day. However, they established themselves with an old native
                     woman, who let out sleeping mats for a few "cash" per night, and traversed the
                     city in a body, eating here and there at the market stalls during the day,
                     which routine they called "seeing the place."</p>
                  <p>My object in visiting this port was to find a vessel bound to Hong Kong; whence
                     I desired to take passage to the United States, being thoroughly tired of
                     roving. I had been moderately successful in a voyage of trade with a small
                     "dhow," and was returning in ballast to Singapore, when one moonlight night,
                     lying becalmed in the Straits of Balli, the dhow was boarded by a small prahu
                     from the mainland, containing forty or fifty saffron-colored miscreants, who,
                     after clashing their creeses about me, and striving in various ways to extort
                     from me what I did not have, to wit, gold, ordered myself and crew into our
                     small boat, and took possession of the vessel. Finding her of little account,
                     for she was an old scow which I had found stranded at Amboyna and bought cheap,
                     they set fire to her, after taking what stores and other plunder there was on
                     board and made off toward the land again with their sweeps, very little the
                     richer for that night's expedition. The old box blazed up beautifully on that
                     moonlight sea; and, together with the long, low, snake-like prahu stealing away
                     into the darkness, made a very pretty moonlight picture. The light of the
                     burning vessel brought down, in a few hours, a French brig, the Beranger, bound
                     to Bourbon Island, which took us thither. My crew, all Javanese but one, went
                     in a small coasting boat to Mauritius.</p>
                  <p>I remained for a few weeks, waiting for the spirit to move me, for I was
                     undetermined upon any course. My funds were safe with a business house at Point
                     de Galle, Ceylon, whose letter of credit and some forty rupees I saved from the
                     greedy hands of the Balli thieves by thrusting them, on the first noise of
                     their approach, into the lead line tub.—There was no vessel bound to Hong Kong,
                     nor to any other place that I would have given a rupee to go to The choice lay
                     between a "gay diang" to Macassar or a Chinese Junk to Singapore. I did not
                     like to face the prospect of a passage in one of the Celestial floating barns,
                     with the almost certainty of lying wind-bound in the straits for fifteen or
                     twenty days, and therefore concluded to wait till something should turn up.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER II.—IN WHICH SOMETHING TURNS UP.</head>
                  <p>Something did turn up. I was contemplating a light transaction in areca nuts,
                     and strolled with that in view down among the warehouses of Putterrum. As I
                     entered one, I heard a voice apparently proceeding from the counting room at
                     the opposite end of the shed, giving some person a recapitulation of his
                     shortcomings; a sort of lecture built upon the famous models of Mrs.
                     Caudle.</p>
                  <p>The loud voice was that of an elderly man, and the responses came in from time
                     to time low and deprecatory.</p>
                  <p>I walked slowly toward the office, seeing no one but a few native porters, who
                     had laid themselves out upon the sacks of merchandise for the midday nap common
                     to the highest and lowest in the tropics.</p>
                  <p>"You went down to Bole's, and you had two bottles there; now don't tell me you
                     didn't, for I paid him for them. Then you had wine and brandy at the 'Jolly
                     Mariner.'"</p>
                  <p>Second voice—"Mr. Creighton, I'll swear to you"—</p>
                  <p>First voice—"Now Jeffers, don't swear to <emph>anything;</emph> you can't tell
                     me; don't I <emph>know you</emph> well enough? You get worse and worse; you've
                     not been in condition to do business in three days; and just now at a time when
                     you could be of a great deal of use to me, Jeffers."</p>
                  <p>Second voice—"Mr. Creighton, I haven't taken"—</p>
                  <p>First voice—"Now don't tell me you <emph>haven't taken</emph>. Didn't you go
                     down to Grimshaw's last night and drink four or five bottles with Capt. Stott?
                     Yes you did; you know you did. Then you went up to Chesney's, had three bottles
                     there; and you told him that I 'would come around and pay it'—that I 'did not
                     pay you enough—and that you intended to leave me in the lurch,' if I did not
                     'mind'—and such stuff as that. And just at this time, Jeffers, when I want,
                     that is, we both want, to—to be very careful. Now what must I think? I don't
                     sleep any. I can't sleep when I see what course you are pursuing, right at a
                     time when, if you had an iota of gratitude in you, you would try to act
                     differently. You know, Jeffers, that I picked you out of the gutter. You were
                     hungry and penniless; you hadn't eaten anything but bananas for four days. And
                     now, all this time, whenever you've been getting drunk and sotting about three
                     days and four days at a time, I've put up with it because you were so penitent
                     and promised to do better. I didn't want to see you starve. I knew you would,
                     or have to ship in a whaleship before the mast."</p>
                  <p>Second voice—"I didn't drink a drop at Chesney's yesterday."</p>
                  <p>First voice—"No; but you did the day before. What does it signify? You went
                     down to the Sicundar Bagh and had two bottles there, and then you went down to
                     an 'opium hell' and laid there all day in an opium trance."</p>
                  <p>Second voice—"I just laid down there"—</p>
                  <p>First voice—"Don't tell me that you didn't; you know that it will be a
                     falsehood if you do. Why your countenance tells it plainly. Your hands tremble
                     now. I've not been on this beach for eight years, not to know what I see. When
                     you're sober there's not a better beach clerk in the port, or sharper business
                     man; but from the first day I took you up, now seven years ago, you have never
                     been perfectly, sober over two or three months at a time. You haven't intended
                     to do it neither, that's where the trouble is. Then you went up to the palace
                     and had four bottles there in that row, sotting with palkee men and the lowest
                     riffraff about there."</p>
                  <p>"Quite a little spree," I thought to myself, and quite a reliable clerk.</p>
                  <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6013-00000004" />
                  <p>I had approached the office near enough for the occupants to see me; but no
                     notice was taken of me by either party, so I sat down upon a rattan settee just
                     without, until the homilies were concluded. I could see both individuals
                     without turning my head, and moralized upon the scene at my leisure.</p>
                  <p>The proprietor, for such was the first speaker, was a tall, thin man, with the
                     peculiar color of Europeans long residents in the tropics, and a most severe
                     money-making cast of features, though with a trace of geniality which had
                     apparently been partly ploughed out from his nature by the long-continued
                     pursuit of gold gathering.</p>
                  <p>"Young man, what do you want," said he, at length.</p>
                  <p>"I came to look up a little investment for the Singapore or Hong Kong markets,"
                     said I, without noticing his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">brusque</foreign> manner;
                     "but as you seem to be in somewhat of a bilious humor I will call again if I
                     conclude to buy."</p>
                  <p>"Nothing shipping to Hong Kong or Singapore either; the Dutch Company have
                     monopolized all the freights. Unless you own a vessel, there's nothing to be
                     made."</p>
                  <p>"He has made money enough," thought I, and walked out. But after a little
                     prospecting I found that though his words were not delivered in the most
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">suave</foreign> manner, they had the merit of being
                     true.</p>
                  <p>The silence of night had fallen upon the town; all business having given way to
                     the noontide nap, taking a palankeen, for the heat was getting oppressive, I
                     was carried at a languid trot back to the "Sicundar Bagh," a large cement
                     structure with wide, open arches, whitewashed and cool. This was the only
                     decent hotel in the town, and was kept by a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ci
                        devant</foreign> Chinese comprador, a half European and half Chinese
                     Boniface, who certainly had a very good <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >menage</foreign>, though his sleeping accommodations consisted of ratan or
                     bamboo cots, caged off in bamboo compartments with matting screens, odorous
                     with perfumes of Araby the blest.</p>
                  <p>I took a siesta, and afterwards a bath and <hi rend="i"/>tiffin. Then thought
                     to while away the time with a game of billiards, in the long wing attached to
                     the hotel, which contained a dozen good American tables. Here the first person
                     that came in my view was the clerk of the beach warehouse, the one whose sins
                     of omission and commission I had heard that morning somewhat feelingly dilated
                     upon. His bearing was considerably different from when he was undergoing the
                     'recapitulation,' and I saw that he was now enjoying the revivifying effect of
                     about three glasses of "smooth brandy." He was not at all the sullen,
                     crouching, browbeaten clerk of the counting-room scene, shaky and pale, and
                     anxious to deny every accusation. As he stood carelessly pushing the balls
                     about with his cue, waiting for a player, he struck me forcibly as being a good
                     specimen of a man utterly wrecked. He was above the ordinary stature, with a
                     slim and well-set figure; but his face, which apparently had been once frank
                     and open, bore now the impress of debauchery, the hard sinister lines of
                     profligacy. As I moved towards the table he turned his large, hollow but
                     piercing black eyes upon me with a glance of recognition, and said, "Do you
                     wish to play, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't mind playing a few games, but not for a stake."</p>
                  <p>"I never gamble," he said, placing the balls.</p>
                  <p>"That is one redeeming trait," I thought, "if it's true," and answered:</p>
                  <p>"It is a custom that I deprecate. There would be no enjoyment in billiards to
                     me if I were compelled to loose or win by the game.</p>
                  <p>We played a few shots, when he said rather abruptly:</p>
                  <p>"Old Creight was rather stringent this morning; he eats too much currie at
                     tiffin. You heard his rigmarole," he continued; "do you think a man could drink
                     as much brandy as he told off on me for a three days jaunt, and live, in a
                     climate like this?"</p>
                  <p>"I should think not, without help," I replied.</p>
                  <p>"No sir. After you left he took a palkee and went to his bungalow up the hill,
                     and I hope there'll be no more of him for a day or two; he has a deal to
                     trouble him at home just now, and that should be sufficient to keep him
                     there."</p>
                  <p>"What is the nature of his domestic troubles?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"Well, he has a daughter, a saucy little witch; the prettiest woman that was
                     ever on this beach, though, and the old Rajah wants her."</p>
                  <p>"The King?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"Well, yes, he calls himself a King or Sultan; he's nothing but a Rajah,
                     though, and a small one at that; and," he continued; "he will have his title of
                     Rajah knocked from under him if he isn't careful how he meddles with the Dutch
                     Company."</p>
                  <p>"Well, where lies the trouble you allude to?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, he is a hundred and fifty years old."</p>
                  <p>"The Rajah?"</p>
                  <p>"More or less," he added.</p>
                  <p>"And the girl is greatly frightened, I suppose," I said.</p>
                  <p>"Well, no, I rather fancy she likes the idea of being a 'queen.'"</p>
                  <p>"You think so?"</p>
                  <p>"I gather that, and the old yellow devil is bent upon having her."</p>
                  <p>"I should suppose that he would not insist, against the will of her
                     father?"</p>
                  <p>"As matters are supposed to stand, he <emph>can</emph> insist. Old Creight and
                     he have been together in the spice trade for years; and nobody knows what
                     devilments they have been up to. Creighton has got to be a nabob; and the Rajah
                     is the greatest old gold hoarder in the East Indies; that is for a king of his
                     calibre."</p>
                  <p>"Do you mean that Mr. Creighton could not send his daughter away without being
                     in jeopardy from the king?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"Exactly so," proceeded the clerk. "He could not leave himself or send her
                     away. He would not be permitted to make the first move, before Old 'Sequins'
                     would be down on him."</p>
                  <p>"He could at any rate take her on board the first English cruiser that stops in
                     here, or send for one through the consul, if need be."</p>
                  <p>"Well," he said pausing, "why doesn't he do it?"</p>
                  <p>"Does he care anything for her?"</p>
                  <p>"She's the apple of his eye."</p>
                  <p>"It is rather singular."</p>
                  <p>"Well, it is somewhat singular to an outsider, but when you've been knocking
                     about this country six or eight years, you'll wonder at nothing.'</p>
                  <p>"I must now look after old Creight's matters on the beach. If you are here when
                     I return I will talk with you again. Perhaps I can put you in a way of making
                     something snug."</p>
                  <p>He turned, after a few steps toward the door, and said:</p>
                  <p>"From what you said you have traded among the groups lately."</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"In your own vessel?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, an old dhow. She's gone glimmering, now, though."</p>
                  <p>"That's immaterial, you can navigate, I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"Are you used to these small <unclear>craft</unclear> out here? Can you handle
                     a lateen rig—a three-masted felucca, for example?"</p>
                  <p>"Well enough."</p>
                  <p>"Humph. So far, good. I'll talk with you again this evening."</p>
                  <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6013-00000005" />
                  <p>"As you please," I answered.</p>
                  <p>"My name is Jeffers. I am quite glad to have made your acquaintance."</p>
                  <p>I gave him mine and he withdrew.</p>
                  <p>It occurred to me that there was some more important relation subsisting
                     between the clerk and his employer than that apparent upon the first view. For
                     what business man would retain in his employ, or even at all, a person who was
                     addicted to drunkenness and profligacy, as was this person. From the little
                     that I had heard in the morning, and the manner of the man who had just left
                     me, as much as what he had said, I felt assured that there was a sphere of
                     usefulness to the merchant that he had grown into and filled, which enabled him
                     to lead a life of frequent dissipation with immunity from discharge.</p>
                  <p>After a little consideration, I determined to enter into the spirit of anything
                     that he might suggest, cautiously observing, however, the limit of
                     prudence.</p>
                  <p>With nothing specially in view, I walked out into the town, and upon reaching
                     the mosque, sauntered into that edifice, but was invited to abstain from coming
                     any further than the entrance by what might have been the grand mutti for all I
                     knew. Standing by the door, I saw a portion of the interior, however, and
                     thought it was tolerably gorgeous for barbarians. Taking the palace terrace, I
                     then strolled out upon the road that winds along the hill and commands a view
                     of the town and harbor. Along this broad graded avenue, which is supported by a
                     continuous revetment of coral rock, are scattered the bungalows of the foreign
                     merchants, consuls, and wealthy native residents. These buildings were for the
                     most part built after the same general model, and were large, single storied
                     rectangular structures, with high open windows, screened with muslin,
                     flat-roofed, and surmounted with one or two greenish domes. They were plastered
                     on the outside with white, yellow or lead-colored stucco, and more or less
                     modeled after the Indian style of architecture.</p>

                  <p>While viewing the beauties observable in the landscape, a small troop of
                     various-colored horses came trotting down the road, with their olive hued
                     grooms, laughing and calling to each other. It was the Rajah's stud, out for
                     their evening course. I noticed some magnificent limbed steeds among them as
                     they came by, all of pure Arabian blood, and several of them snow-white, and
                     without a spot.</p>
                  <p>"The old satrap keeps good horses," I thought, as their clattering hoofs
                     receded, leaving a slight mist of dust buoyant on the evening breeze. I noticed
                     a commotion among them, and heard an increased confusion of voices, now
                     rendered indistinct by the distance, while at the same moment the cavalcade
                     parted right and left, and a young girl, mounted on a superb lithe-limbed
                     Arabian mare, came bounding along the road. She was simply radiantly beautiful.
                     I might have had a better view of her in passing, had she not, with a sauciness
                     that somewhat exceeded, as I thought, the bounds of propriety, brushed a long
                     garland of crimson wild flowers in my face as she galloped past me.</p>
                  <p>"On the <unclear>Di.</unclear> Vernon order," was my astonished ejaculation,
                     and I stooped to pick up one of the large crimson bells that had fallen from
                     the twig.</p>
                  <p>"That is, without doubt, old Creighton's daughter," said I, "and a very fine
                     girl she is, but—"</p>
                  <p>Women are not afraid of doing some very impudent things at times, especially if
                     they are not compelled to remain and face what might follow. "I'll warrant she
                     is demure enough in a drawing room," I reflected as I proceeded on my
                     ramble.</p>
                  <p>My walk brought me to a bridge, and thence I took a street leading down to the
                     town. On my way thither I met my friends of the bark, a little elevated with
                     toddy, and singing very loudly the chorus: <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>"And how does the search come on," I asked. "If you can't find a home, I
                     suppose you'd take up with a chance to ship on a homeward-bound ship?"</p>
                  <p>"Hello, Doc! Where do you keep yourself?" asked one.</p>
                  <p>They had started the title of "Doc" on board the vessel, from my performing two
                     operations in minor surgery on the passing down—bandaging the cooper's arm, and
                     stitching up a gash in a boat-steerer's cheek, both wounds received in the
                     capture of a humpback whale.</p>

                     patronized some of the bazaars, for they now sported red sashes and kreeses;
                     and were apparently anxious for an opportunity to make use of them upon the
                     "copper-colored scorpions" about the port. They reiterated their expressions of
                     interest for my welfare, and assured me that if I wanted them for any little
                     "cruise among the islands," I might consider myself captain of "Gideon's
                     Band."</p>
                  <p>That evening, while looking over the columns of the latest
                        <title>Scindian</title>, Mr. Jeffers came in, called for a
                        <unclear>carston</unclear> of brandy, and commenced<pb n="10-11"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000006" /> conversation on the subject he had introduced
                     last, in a very guarded non-committal manner. After some half hour's talk in
                     this style, he suddenly changed and said, off-hand:</p>
                  <p>"Well, it's just such a person as yourself that is wanted; and if you'd like a
                     chance to make some money by a short cruise and a little risk. you can have
                     it."</p>
                  <p>"But of course I should want to know the business that the vessel is bound on
                     before I took charge of her," said I.</p>
                  <p>"You can know that just as you are going on board, and then if you see anything
                     you dislike about it you need not, of course, move a stop. The reason of that
                     course is simply this: the parties for whom I act don't care to have their
                     secret rattling about in the head of any one too long before its time to act.
                     It might produce—well its impolitic.</p>
                  <p>"I see; very good. I'll take the vessel into the track of the homeward-bound
                     East Indiamen. What then? board and capture one?"</p>
                  <p>He laughed. "Not quite, but perhaps a few packages of luggage may be put on
                     board, and passengers accompany it."</p>
                  <p>"Ah; defaulters, criminals, or anything of the sort!"</p>
                  <p>"No sir. No chance for compromising you in any way. You'll understand all about
                     it before you go on board."</p>
                  <p>"I don't mind consenting to perform, especially with the reserved right to
                     refuse at the last moment."</p>
                  <p>"That's good enough; I've been on the watch for the right person for three
                     weeks, and now that so much is done, let's play a game or two and then go out
                     for a 'slam round.' I can show you some little mysteries in this town that dont
                     appear to the naked eye."</p>
                  <p>I declined politely the "mysteries" feeling satisfied that the gambling hells
                     of Putterrum could afford me no interest or edification, but accepted the
                     billiards.</p>
                  <p>During the game he asked:</p>
                  <p>"Who were those fellows you were with?"</p>
                  <p>"When?"</p>
                  <p>"Yesterday."</p>
                  <p>"You saw me, then, did you?"</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Si Senor</foreign>," said he, making a shot.</p>
                  <p>"They were men shipped by the run in the bark that I came here in."</p>
                  <p>"You know them somewhat, then?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, somewhat."</p>
                  <p>"Whaling sailors?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"What are they looking for, a ship?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, yes, a ship bound home, or a short cruise in anything but a whaler."</p>
                  <p>"They've got enough of whaling?"</p>
                  <p>"I judge so from their talk."</p>
                  <p>"Could you get them to go with you?"</p>
                  <p>"I might."</p>
                  <p>"Well that would be a good move," he said, turning from the game, "only say
                     nothing about it to them for the present."</p>
                  <p>"I saw your employer's daughter to-day," said I, after the conversation had
                     changed.</p>
                  <p>"Fannie Creighton? On horseback, wasn't she?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, on the hill road."</p>
                  <p>"She's a typhoon. Always on horseback; if 'Old Sequins,' up there on the hill,
                     don't get her, she'll lead some man a devil of a life."</p>
                  <p>"Is she high tempered?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, I don't know as she is; in fact, I know but very little about her, but
                     she doesn't fear anything to speak of, and would be apt to do entirely as she
                     pleased, and her husband would have his time fully employed if he undertook to
                     control her with a curb but the Rajah is crazy after her since she's been back,
                     and I suppose he will get her."</p>
                  <p>"She don't stay here, then, generally?" I said.</p>
                  <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6013-00000007" />
                  <p>"Oh no she's been brought up principally at Cape Town, the Isle of France and
                     Singapore. Old Creight is a widower, and Fannie was a little snip of a girl
                     when he came out here. The old man failed in Liverpool and came out here to get
                     on his legs again. An old French lady at Mauritius has had charge of her.
                     Fannie comes out here every four months or so. You wouldn't see a girl with a
                     complexion like her's, raised on this island."</p>
                  <p>I inquired of the necessity of her father's sacrificing her to the old Rajah;
                     but he did not seem to be as communicative on that subject as before. I
                     supposed, therefore, that was merely said for an object.</p>

                     or prehu very long and with exceedingly fine lines. She had belonged to a party
                     of young men, many of them cashiered officers from the Indian Navy and Army,
                     who were cruising about in her, for what purpose no one exactly knew. She was
                     named the "Nautch Girl," and came into the hands of the present owner at a
                     sacrifice. In fact she was mortgaged for means to enable the party to fit

                     contain all its active and medicinal properties, to the exclusion of the bitter

                     only solved in "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar."</p>
                  <p>The great merits of Tar are again coming to the attention of the Physicians of
                     France, and several trials were made in fifteen hospitals with the best
                     results. Hundreds of Physicians in the United States prescribe 'Dr. Crook's
                     Wine of Tar' because they find it the best preparation in the market. See that
                     every bottle has the name of "Oliver Crook &amp; Co." on the wrapper. All

                     Bladder, &amp;c. &amp;c. and it is its action upon this membrane which gives
                     "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" such great success, and gives it the prominent place

                  <p>My new acquaintance seemed to have time enough at his disposal, and suggested a
                     sail down the bay to see her.</p>
                  <p>We were soon on the water in a little deep-built pink-sterned boat, with a
                     sprit-sail, and as the breeze was steady, slipped briskly along past the
                     congregated proas, "gay-diangs," "cougnars," junks and other vessels of
                     outlandish build. Soon rounding the stern of a lumbering "country ship," which
                     lay at anchor a cable's length from the "Nautch Girl," we stood across the bows
                     and luffed alongside the latter vessel. We did not go on board, but I saw that
                     she was plainly but well built, upon a very fine model and was heavily sparred.
                     Her long lateen yards were beautiful symmetrical sticks, and with the short
                     raking masts which supported them, were of a white shining species of timber
                     not common to mere drogers or cheaply built craft. Her sails were being bent
                     and were new. There were workmen engaged, apparently, upon the repair of her
                     cabin. We passed under the stern and read the name "Nautch Girl." "Singapore,"
                     the letters of which were carved and gilt—the only ornamental work observable.
                     Her decks were clear fore and aft, excepting a caboose and a heavy teak boat
                     between the foremost and mainmast. The rail was low, and the deck plank narrow.
                     From the flatness of her decks and some other points, I judged that she was
                     designed by some one of sound nautical taste and experience.</p>
                  <p>A serang and his lascars were bending her sails. The white duck hung
                     picturesquely from the lofty yards, and the native riggers looked like lizzards
                     crawling up and along the smooth spars, which glistened in the sunshine and
                     were without a blemish. She was worth making any sort of a trial for. The clerk
                     noticed my look of admiration, and said: "It's a very little thing you have to
                     do to get her; but the person for whom I act will have no use for the vessel
                     after her mission is over; and so if you are the lucky one, you'll get
                     her."</p>
                  <p>I answered more decidedly than before, that I would undertake the performance
                     of the trip and provide the men.</p>
                  <p>"Very good. I thought you<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6013-00000008" /> would, and
                     now there comes to be considered a point or two requiring some little address
                     and—ah—false appearances." A person, not the real owner, now has the vessel in
                     charge, and is fitting her up for sea. There she will lie, with a shipkeeper on
                     board, until the next move is taken. I will point the person out to you and you
                     can get more information from him."</p>
                  <p>With that the boat was laid along side the low boat wharf, and we jumped out.
                     Handing the man a rupee for his boat, we walked about the lower part of the
                     town until, after looking around in all sorts of places, junk sheds, opium
                     hells, bird fanciers', monkey emporiums; drinking shanties, and various dingy
                     holes, swarming with a mongrel population of Malays, Lascars, Chinese, women,
                     thieves and desperadoes, he at last pointed out a short, stout,
                     Portuguese-looking man, with gold ear-rings and snaky black eyes set obliquely
                     in a flat, villainous, sensual Mongolian countenance.</p>
                  <p>"That's 'Macao Joe;' he's spotted, so I must not speak with him here; but you
                     must introduce the conversation by saying that 'Jeffers told you that the
                     "Nautch Girl" was for sale.' He will understand you then."</p>
                  <p>"Who is he?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"He has been an interpreter on Coolie ships sailing out of Macao. He's out of
                     that now, and picks up crews for country ships, furnishes working gangs,
                     gambles, and fits up vessels occasionally. He has mohurs in abundance though,
                     and keeps a palkee." "There," he continued, "he just told that woman that he
                     was going up to the 'Iron Pot.' That will be a good place to see him. We'll
                     take a palkee up to that end of town, for it's getting hot. I've been drinking
                     rather stoutly of late, and can't stand the sun."</p>
                  <p>On our way up there, as the palkee bearers trotted slowly along side by side,
                     Jeffers furnished some more meagre information, in his hidden ambiguous way,
                     which completely mystified me regarding the real nature of the business I was
                     about to engage in. I had imagined that some persons, state criminals, perhaps,
                     and these are numerous around small oriental potentates, were secreted here,
                     and were to be conveyed away. This did not seem likely from subsequent remarks
                     which he let fall. "Perhaps Jeffers himself." No, he was but a go-between. So
                     was Macao Joe. Perhaps it had something to do with the "Heavenly Three," a sort
                     of fraternity widely extended among the lowest classes of that mixed population
                     which infests the ports of China and the Indies, called generally by Europeans
                     the "Triad Society."</p>
                  <p>It was some of the "Heavenly Three" that boarded me in the straits of Balli. I
                     suppose. I rejected all these suppositions as improbable, and concluded that,
                     be it what it might, it was certainly an affair that would be quickly prevented
                     if discovered, and that my suitability and value for the part that was offered
                     me consisted in the fact that I was a total stranger. An attempt to get a
                     master for the vessel among the sailors of the port would induce suspicion and
                     investigation; and I recollected that Jeffers had asked—almost the first
                     question—whether I spoke the native language. I did a little, but so
                     indifferently that, not considering it worth an affirmative reply, I answered
                     negatively. Nevertheless, I understood him when he told a native official of
                     some kind in Hindostanee that I was "a missionary." I felt that I could spring
                     a mine on Mr. Jeffers and his <foreign xml:lang="LAT">sub rosa</foreign>
                     employers, whoever they were, by simply taking an interpreter and asking any
                     two or three of the population at random, "what it was that Mr. Jeffers wanted
                     me to take a felucca a few hundred miles to sea for?"</p>
                  <p>I had asked if Mr. Creighton was aware of this project in any way, and was
                     cautioned by the clerk not to speak of it in the remotest manner, if by chance
                     or in <choice>
                        <sic>busines</sic>
                        <corr>business</corr>
                     </choice> I met that gentleman. It had the appearance of an elopement; but who
                     were the parties? Any one who could afford to give away a vessel need not have
                     to elope in this apparently dangerous way, unless it was with a princess of the
                     blood, and I believe there were none of those in the market at all. The more I
                     reflected on it, the more bewildered I became; but I determined not to distress
                     myself about it, but to earn that staunch, fast-sailing felucca out in the bay,
                     though, if it was taking too much risk, in the last hour I could throw up the
                     business and go back quietly to the Sicendar Bagh, and wait for a ship to Hong
                     Kong.</p>

                  <p>We arrived at the extremity of the city, where Putterrum ends and the taro
                     patches and jungle begin. A point of land ran out into the bay, at the
                     extremity of which was an old castle or fort, containing some very good French
                     guns. The houses were fewer, and scattered off toward the point; and, among the
                     taro-patches, close to the water, was a long tile-roofed house, with a dozen
                     canoe-like boats on the beach at the door. Jeffers had turned his palkee off
                     among the taro-patches. I pointed to the house and said:</p>
                  <p>"Iron Pot?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Shahib," said the bearer, and on reaching it I gave the palkee men "drink

                     palkee passed us lower down by the beach; he was looking over a man's shoulder
                     while the latter read aloud a letter written in French. Macao Joe could not
                     read. It was something like a love-letter.</p>
                  <p>I took a glass of brandy and water at the bar, and after the letter was
                     concluded accosted him:</p>
                  <p>"You are <choice>
                        <sic>Macoa</sic>
                        <corr>Macao</corr>
                     </choice> Joe, I believe!"</p>
                  <p>"Dey call me dat."</p>
                  <p>"You pick up crews for vessels?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, I finds dem some time," looking very inquiringly at me with his snaky
                     eyes and a slight scowl withal.</p>
                  <p>There was no one near, so I said in a low tone:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Jeffers told me that the "Nautch Girl is for sale."</p>
                  <p>His eyes changed their expression at the word "Jeffers. And when I had finished
                     the sentence, he took rapid scrutiny of me from head to foot, saying:</p>
                  <p>"You tink you buy?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"How much you geev?'</p>
                  <p>"How much do you want?"</p>
                  <p>He answered this question like some of my own countrymen, by asking
                     another.</p>
                  <p>"Ken you sail a ship, take de sun an' all dat?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"How much year you navigate?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, off and on a long time."</p>
                  <p>"You know all bout crenometer?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said I, bluntly, not liking to stand one of "Lloyd's" examinations from
                     such as he. He noticed the tone, and his eyes gave the faintest possible
                     scintillation; but he answered:</p>
                  <p>"Den I give you dat boat, if you get crew and take her out to sea."</p>
                  <p>"When?"</p>
                  <p>"I tell you day after to-morrow. Den I know. Do not now."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Macao Joe," said I to myself, "I am getting tolerably well disgusted
                     with Mr. Jeffers' and your hoodwinking and fol de rol. If you<pb n="16-17"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000009" /> want me to get a crew and take the vessel out to
                     sea, or wherever she is to go, I must know something more than I now do, or it
                     will not be long before I conclude to have nothing to do with it."</p>
                  <p>"Den you no like go; you no go, eh?" As he spoke this, a most diabolical
                     expression flitted over and settled upon his Asiatic countenance.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I'd like to do the job and get the vessel, but I insist upon knowing when
                     I am to be ready, and what is the risk, if there be risk, that I take, either
                     now or afterward; or in case the project should get wind and be prevented, who
                     wants to prevent it, and who don't? That is about the extent of my thirst for
                     knowledge at this stage of the proceedings."</p>
                  <p>"Well, den, I tell you. Mr. Jeffers no tell you?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he told me some things, and said that you would explain more fully, and
                     it was for that object I sought you."</p>
                  <p>"Dere are some peoples what want to get away from Putterrum; and the king he no
                     like hab 'em go, he make too much out'en dem. So de king hab plenty spies to
                     watch. Eberybody be spy to get de money, dey know dey git money, dey fraid to
                     go in any ship cause dey know it at de Custom House, and ship no get her papers
                     till been search, den if dey on board it be bad ting I tink, king he do what he
                     please."</p>
                  <p>"Well, now then, what would be the result if we got caught before we got
                     outside?"</p>
                  <p>Macao Joe reflected, and said:</p>
                  <p>"Well den, I tink somebody stick knife in you, and wid dem odder man's what go
                     I spec he do more'n dat."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, that's it. Stick a knife in me in some dark corner," I said:</p>
                  <p>"You see when de king want white mans out de way he no kill 'em and
                        <unclear>cut ears off now like he use'd de.</unclear> De Dutch Com'ny make
                     big row 'bout dat, so when he wants mans killed somebody stick knife in 'em,
                     dat's a fight. Dutch Com'ny no care 'bout dat. Den you see some black debbil
                     drunk for long time."</p>
                  <p>"And if we get out all right, how then?"</p>
                  <p>"Den you hab a fine vessel, but neber come back to Putterrum."</p>
                  <p>That word grated on me, somehow. The last thing that Jeffers said as his palkee
                     was diverging from mine had been: "Of course, Putterrum will be a sealed book
                     to you afterwards."</p>
                  <p>What should I care about Putterrum, the dirty miserable hole? The last place in
                     the world to live in or sojourn at. But somehow or other, I could not get over
                     it, and at last admitted to myself that there would have been no reason for
                     liking the town, if I had not taken that stroll up on the hill road. The idea
                     was foolish, and I dismissed it.</p>
                  <p>After some more conversation with Macao Joe, I took the palkee back to the
                     Sicundar Bagh, for the noonday sun was scorching out the vital element of the
                     atmosphere, and the lassitude, which the most hardy constitution cannot repel
                     in those latitudes, was creeping over me.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER VI.—MISS CREIGHTON.</head>
                  <p>I awoke from my sleep and sat up on the side of the ratan cot at the Sicundar
                     Bagh, and reflected. I washed my face in a brazen basin, lit a cigar and
                     lounged back in the cot again, reflecting on the enterprise of Jeffers &amp;
                     Co. It did not seem like the golden opportunity that it had appeared early in
                     the morning. I set a sort of balance, thus: The "Nautch Girl" and the ready
                     gold in one scale, and—Putterrum a sealed book in the other. Then there were a
                     few make-weights in the way of knives, bow-strings, poison and the like, that
                     did not entirely tirely sooth the troubled mind. I went to tiffin and partook
                     of some mysterious but savory dishes, and a small bottle of cool champagne, and
                     felt better. If I was to leave the town for good I would take a farewell view
                     of it from the hill road.</p>
                  <p>Taking some little pains with my simple toilet I left the hotel for the walk.
                     My first care was to call at the rendezvous of Gideon's band, and taking one of
                     the most prudent of them aside, hinted that I was getting up an enterprise that
                     would afford an improvement on life at Putterrum, to say the least. He
                     expressed himself for all, eagerly, and hinted that funds were getting low with
                     some of them already. I immediately told him to say that I would come back
                     again and provide for board for the entire party for a while at least. That was
                     balm for "Gideon's Band," if not in Gilead, and I left them more eager than
                     ever to bestow upon me the leadership of the party, which had now been
                     augmented by three other whalemen and five American man-of-wars men, all
                     deserters, perhaps, but united in one body politic for mutual benefit—nineteen,
                     all told—and quite ready for any adventure that I might propose. Here was the
                     crew for the "Nautch Girl," at a word.</p>
                  <p>It was but a passing glance that I had had of the radiant young equestrienne on
                     the preceding day, yet, transient and momentary as it was, it left an
                     indescribable emotion in my breast that passed with me at the time for
                     admiration merely. But now I wended my way toward the hill road, undecided and
                     miserable. Here was love at first sight with a vengeance. "Pshaw," I muttered,
                     "what have I, a homeless wanderer, to do with the entertainment of such
                     emotions?" Nevertheless, I strode along the gentle ascent leading to the Palace
                     road with no other object in view than to obtain, if possible, one more glance
                     at the merchant's daughter.</p>
                  <p>I fully appreciated the absurdity and apparent hopelessness of this sudden
                     passion, and had my attention been required in any channel, I should not have
                     suffered it to take such immediate possession of my whole being. The
                     alternative of giving up the proffered opportunity of being owner and master of
                     such a vessel, or turning the city that she made bright with her presence into
                     a lurking place for assassins, waiting specialiy for me, was well pondered upon
                     as I sauntered along, without, however, arriving at any definite determination
                     of what was my proper-course of procedure. To decline the clerk's offer would
                     simply enable me to remain in the port—nothing more. There was a long road,
                     presenting many difficulties, even to obtaining an introduction. And what then?
                     I had the usual amount of confidence in my good looks and winning ways that is
                     common to young men generally; but the only daughter of a wealthy Englishman of
                     aristocratic prejudices would be about the last person whom a stranger and
                     comparatively moneyless adventurer might hope to win. Not that my career had
                     been such as would of necessity excluded me from the pale of society; nor was I
                     without respectable and even wealthy friends and acquaintances in this part of
                     the globe; but an adventurer is almost invariably considered as nothing but an
                     adventurer by all respectable people, and particularly by John Bull.</p>
                  <p>I had walked a mile, perhaps, with these and other similar reflections
                     uppermost in my mind, and had left the vicinity of her father's residence. I
                     stopped to light a cigar and lean a few moments upon the stone ballustrade of a
                     bridge that spanned a deep irregular ravine, at the bottom of which a brook
                     hurried along on<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6013-00000010" /> its way to the sea.
                     As the fragrant cheroot asserted its calming and humanizing influence upon my
                     mind, a plainer and more practical view of the case prevailed. I was ashamed of
                     my romantic and foolish waverings. The whole aspect of the subject impressed me
                     as extremely nonsensical; and I forthwith determined with a single impulse, to
                     tell Jeffers that evening that I had learned of the nature of the trip and the
                     risks attendant from Macao Joe, but that I had the men ready and waited only
                     for the word. Out upon the placid surface of the bay rode the felucca swinging
                     lightly at her <hi rend="i"/>coir cable. Her sails were now all bent, and there
                     were several boats alongside, bringing evidently the stores for the trip. With
                     my pocket-glass I could see that they were hoisting in barrels with a whip.
                     From the number of barrels and boxes that were on her deck in the waist, it
                     seemed that she was being victualled either for a large number or a long
                     voyage. My eyes dwelt with a seaman's admiration upon her beautiful model and
                     general graceful taunt exterior.</p>
                  <p>Far out into the small bay stretched the sandy point, with its thin, straggling
                     jungle, and at the extremity stood the gray castle, with a small fleet of war
                     proas at anchor around it, the navy of the Rajah. Farther out from the fort two
                     small steamers, also in the same service, were at anchor, one of which was the
                     flagship, and had on board a brass band. They were then playing, and the music
                     floated with a soft, mellow cadence along through the uncouth shipping, over
                     the sea of roots below and up to the cool terrace where I stood. The music was
                     "Lochaber no more."</p>
                  <p>"The leaven of civilization is working in these remote regions," I thought." "A
                     fleet of proas, with a brass band among them: How long is it since this benign
                     Rajah sent his navy out to skulk about islets and the straits in search of
                     junks and native traders? Not a great many years. The monsoons brought his
                     revenue to him then, and it comes in now with more show of red tape and
                     papering, but not much honester, I am afraid. Putterrum, city of the blest, I
                     shall bid you farewell in a few days— <q>
                        <l>"And if forever, then forever fare the well."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I heard the approach of horses. It was only the Rajah's body guard, patrol, or
                     something of the sort. Their bridles and accoutrements jingled orientally as
                     they passed along Their uniform was a barbaric imitation of French chasseurs,
                     and their commanding officer was unmistakably a moustached fierce-looking
                     Frenchmen. When they had passed I turned seaward again, and mingling reveries
                     and cigar smoke, I thought of my past turbulent life, of my old home on the
                     Susquehanna, of the burning dhow, the bark, the restless spirits composing
                     "Gideon's Band" waiting my orders, Jeffers and his mysterious outlawed
                     employers, and then I thought of the sweet English face that was fixed like an
                     instantaneous photograph upon my soul.</p>
                  <p>"Stranger!"</p>
                  <p>Hearing this backwoods salutation of my own country, I wheeled as briskly as a
                     French sergeant at dress parade. A clear and bell-like voice spoke the word,
                     and turning I beheld the tall, lithe form of the subject of my reverie, looking
                     steadfastly at me. A smile, gentle and modest, illumined her now half-bashful
                     face, but her eyes had a certain unconventional fearlessness of expression, a
                     sort of "clear lookout afar" that lent a double splendor to their deep liquid
                     azure.</p>
                  <p>"I wish to ask your pardon," she said, as I turned, "for my rudeness
                     yesterday."</p>
                  <p>Some half-gallant reply was on my lips, for if my self-possession is greater at
                     one time more than another it is in a moment of extreme danger, or in the
                     presence of a handsome woman. But she continued:</p>
                  <p>"I mistook you, then, for a person whom I know and dislike, and did not
                     discover the mistake until I had committed the rude act. It was not very
                     proper, I suppose, in either case, but," she proceeded, "I dislike him, and in
                     a thoughtless moment intended to tell him so in that manner."</p>
                  <p>"And who, may I ask, is the person that so resembles me, and is so fortunate as
                     to have even the displeasure of so glorious a being?"</p>
                  <p>A startled and somewhat arch expression flitted over her features as she
                     hastened to interrupt me with:</p>
                  <p>"I have said so much to properly explain the rudeness, but," gathering up the
                     reins of her bay Arabian, "there can be nothing further <choice>
                        <sic>revelant</sic>
                        <corr>relevant</corr>
                     </choice> to the apology."</p>
                  <p>"Then will you be kind enough to accept my thanks for that thoughtless impulse
                     which has procured me the pleasure of a moment's speech with a very charming
                     young lady?"</p>
                  <p>I said this with a feeling of reckless gallantry, for I had made up my mind to
                     leave in the "Nautch Girl," and felt in the mood for bandying gallant speeches,
                     careless how Hibernian they might be as regarded directness.</p>
                  <p>She smiled and frowned at the same time, her face wearing the expression of a
                     handsome woman trying to be displeased with a compliment, and replied:</p>
                  <p>"And I in turn thank you for the readiness with which you pardon my act of
                     yesterday. Good afternoon, sir."</p>
                  <p>She was about to gallop away, when I said quickly, to protract the interview a
                     little longer:</p>
                  <p>"Pardon the detention, if you please; but I desire very much to<pb n="20-21"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000011" /> know how you succeeded in approaching me so
                     noiselessly, on horseback. I was not asleep, and was as much as anything else
                     listening for the sound of your horse's feet."</p>
                  <p>"You were waiting for me?"</p>
                  <p>"With much respect, yes."</p>
                  <p>"Why did you think you would meet me?"</p>
                  <p>"You ride morning and evening."</p>
                  <p>"Are you a stranger in this port?"</p>
                  <p>"I was, but since seeing you"—</p>
                  <p>"No more of that."</p>
                  <p>"An' thou lovest me," said I, making out a quotation.</p>
                  <p>"This is what one gets by indirectness," she said in a low tone; "but you have
                     not answered me. Are you a stranger?"</p>
                  <p>"I arrived three days ago."</p>
                  <p>"Then having seen me but once, how did you know it was my custom to ride on
                     this road daily?"</p>
                  <p>"I might say that I guessed it from the grace with which you rode yesterday.
                     Such dash and elegance united come only from daily practice."</p>
                  <p>"Well, do you then say that you arrived at the conclusion from reasoning thus
                     upon the subject?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I was told it."</p>
                  <p>"By the person to whom you communicated my unladylike act?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I breathed that to no one."</p>
                  <p>"The information was volunteered?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, partly:"</p>
                  <p>"You know my name, then?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"What's your's?" she asked in a softer tone.</p>
                  <p>I gave her the fictitious name I had assumed for the present, in view of the <choice>

                        <corr>business</corr>
                     </choice> contemplated, though my real name was known at the consul's
                     office.</p>
                  <p>She paused a moment: "Excuse my catechising you thus. I have not answered your
                     question. This animal can creep like a pointer dog. It was trained in those
                     stealthy movements by a young Sikh chief, who gave it to me at Benares."</p>
                  <p>"Have you been much at Benares?"</p>
                  <p>"Only one season."</p>
                  <p>"How do you like it?"</p>
                  <p>"Not at all?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, why not, if I may ask?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I don't like large cities, at least in India, but I should like them in
                     England, I know."</p>
                  <p>"And do you expect soon to go there?"</p>
                  <p>She appeared a little pained at some thought the question suggested, and
                     answered, looking to the ground:</p>
                  <p>"Not for the present, if ever," and then continued, "you have not told who was
                     the person who spake to you of me."</p>
                  <p>"You did not ask."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I do now."</p>
                  <p>"I have said so much to properly explain."</p>
                  <p>"There, dont hand me back my own words, it is not in keeping with your previous
                     gallantry, she returned quickly, with a smile.</p>
                  <p>"But perhaps it might cause some trouble."</p>
                  <p>"You need not mind, I already know."</p>
                  <p>"Then perhaps you can tell me."</p>
                  <p>"It was a person named Jeffers."</p>
                  <p>"True enough; but it now occurs to me that there is something not apparent that
                     you wish to approach."</p>
                  <p>"Do you think so?" with a little surprise.</p>
                  <p>"I think so; and if you will not consider it impertinent. I would like to know
                     how Mr. Jeffers came to speak of me to you?"</p>
                  <p>She paused again as if to reflect, and answered: "He spoke of you in my
                     hearing."</p>
                  <p>"It was necessary that I should know something more, so I asked: <unclear>"In
                        what connection? if the</unclear> question is not trespassing too much upon
                     so short an acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>"In connection with an enterprise projected by himself and some others," she
                     answered, looking steadily at me.</p>
                  <p>"You know all about it then?"</p>
                  <p>"Not all, but something."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, Miss Creighton, I will ask you one more question. No idle one, I
                     assure you," I said, assuming a serious tone, "but a question of advice and
                     direction. Mr. Jeffers has made a proposition to me which I have accepted with
                     a reservation to reconsider at the last moment if I choose, when the business
                     is fully explained, but how am I to be certain that it will be fully explained
                     then, or that I will be able, if it is, to judge of the extent and consequences
                     of my complicity in the matter? Moreover, by refusing at the lass moment, I may
                     place others in greater jeopardy than they are now. Therefore, as you seem to
                     know, and from what you have said it is evident that you do know, the general
                     nature of the undertaking; and as that is for some cogent reason kept from me
                     at present, I will ask you and be governed by your reply, whether I in
                     accepting the duty that has been offered me, have involved myself in any
                     criminal or dishonorable connection?"</p>
                  <p>"What causes you to think that you have?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"The persons with whom I have been brought in contact in the preliminary steps,
                     the extraordinary secresy, the extreme reticence of Mr. Jeffers, and the
                     secresy observed toward myself."</p>
                  <p>"And what if I am compelled to answer that you have involved yourself?"</p>
                  <p>"Then I should abandon the adventure forthwith, when it is not too late for the
                     success of the parties concerned, leaving them to find some more suitable
                     person."</p>
                  <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6013-00000012" />
                  <p>"Are afraid of the risk?"</p>
                  <p>"Not in a good cause; but I have risked my life too many times amidst honorable
                     dangers, to now jeopardise it in any infamous undertaking."</p>
                  <p>"And what leads you to suppose that I would be cognizant of any infamous
                     undertakings?" she asked with a certain tone and manner.</p>
                  <p>This was rather a poser; but between ourselves, reader, I thought that she was
                     just the girl to be mixed up with the intrigues around small Indian potentates.
                     I had seen such things in my experiences, and her style of dialogue
                     strengthened the impression.</p>
                  <p>"I hardly know how to answer that," I replied slowly, taking time, "but as you
                     have said that you knew something of the affair, and as the whole proceedings
                     have a strong smack of Oriental politics, suggesting assassination, forgery,
                     plundered exchequers and flight, is it strange that I should be willing to
                     think that you might be privy, at least partially, to something of the kind,
                     especially when I consider our first meeting, and our rather unusual
                     introduction and conversation?"</p>
                  <p>The crimson mounted to her cheeks and forehead, and then in her eyes came a
                     wild, strange expression, a faint trace of which had lurked there several times
                     during the whole conversation. She controlled the emotion that appeared
                     struggling for utterance; then, in a lower, and, it seemed, a triumphant tone,
                     said:</p>
                  <p>"But you have trusted me with your complicity already, and would further be
                     quieted by my advice."</p>
                  <p>"That is strange to you, perhaps, and it is so to me in a measure; but
                     nevertheless, I should be guided implicitly by your advice in whatever course
                     you may suggest."</p>
                  <p>"What if I should be an intriguante<foreign xml:lang="FRA">guante</foreign> in
                     the 'Oriental politics' to which you allude? You have committed yourself to me
                     completely, be on what side I may. It is easy to see what would be the course
                     consistent with the spirit of such desperate deeds as far as regards
                     yourself."</p>
                  <p>"What?" I asked, a little at a loss to understand her,</p>
                  <p>"There's a variety, though not an option."</p>
                  <p>"I do not comprehend yet exactly."</p>
                  <p>"You are neither for nor against, and have enough of the secret to be
                     dangerous."</p>
                  <p>"I think I understand now," I replied, "but go on."</p>
                  <p>She leaned forward in the saddle and said, with a wicked look in her blue
                     eyes:</p>
                  <p>"The bow-string, poison or the knife. Don't you think I've got you?"</p>
                  <p>I was thunderstruck; she struck me at the moment as exceedingly dangerous
                     muslin for a man in my circumstances to dally with.</p>
                  <p>She was right. Whichever side of the miserable business she was interested in
                     or connected with—and it was plain now that she was not indifferent about it,
                     she held my life in her hands. I began to feel quite uncomfortable. She leaned
                     forward again and said:</p>
                  <p>"Since you have trusted me so far, an admission more or less makes but little
                     difference; tell me what was to be your reward?"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Was to be?</emph>" Those words sound-like a death knell. After a keen
                     scrutiny of her beautiful face, I answered:</p>
                  <p>"The vessel and a hundred mohurs."</p>
                  <p>"And to what use did you intend putting the vessel?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, that's something," thought I, "that I am sure you don't know, so I will
                     not tell you," and said:</p>
                  <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6013-00000013" />
                  <p>"Oh, there is use enough in these waters for a fast sailing felucca."</p>
                  <p>She gave me a penetrating glance at this reply, and said:</p>
                  <p>"Well, it is unimportant—perhaps."</p>
                  <p>"Since you have my information in addition to your own, let me ask when it was
                     that Mr. Jeffers spoke of me in your presence, as you have said?"</p>
                  <p>"I beg pardon, I said in my <emph>hearing</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"Whoa, Cheetah," she continued carelessly, to the bay mare, patting the animal,
                     which ceased its restiveness at the sound of her voice.</p>
                  <p>Here was another revelation which did not tend to reassure me, but feeling that
                     I was to be mixed up in some affair that was going to raise the "devil's
                     delight," as sailors express it, and whether I would or not, I merely said:</p>
                  <p>"Well, Miss Creighton, I am new ready for your advice."</p>
                  <p>"You are sure you will follow it?" she responded.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," I said, "positively sure. Your connection with this infernal business is
                     incomprehensible, and not pleasant to contemplate; but if there is one thing
                     that I am sure of more than another, it is that I shall follow your advice to
                     the letter <emph>now</emph>."</p>
                  <p>Her manner changed, and with a smiling expression, which was slightly roguish,
                     coming back to her lovely features, she replied:</p>
                  <p>(TO BE CONTINUED.)</p>
                  <p>The interesting romance of "The Nautch Girl" will be published in serial form
                     for twelve weeks. By stitching each number before cutting the leaves, and
                     preserving them, you will have a "New Story" at no expense.</p>

                  <p>Tar has long been known as a valuable medicine; yet, how to prepare it to

                     only solved in "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar."</p>
                  <p>The great merits of Tar are again coming to the attention of the Physicians of
                     France, and several trials were made in fifteen hospitals with the best
                     results. Hundreds of Physicians in the United States prescribe 'Dr. Crook's
                     Wine of Tar' because they find it the best preparation in the market. See that
                     every bottle has the name of "Oliver Crook &amp; Co." on the wrapper. All

                  <p>Every one knows that Tar is one of the most powerful modifiers of the mucous
                     membrane, and this membrane lines the Stomach, Intestines, Throat, Lungs,
                     Bladder, &amp;c. &amp;c. and it is its action upon this membrane which gives
                     "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" such great success, and gives it the prominent place
                     it now has in the world. "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" is a clear fluid, divested
                     of all foreign matter, rich in the medicinal properties of Tar, pleasant to the
                     taste, and endowed with efficacious properties. Try one bottle.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.—THE CONSUL.</head>
                  <p>The time for vacillation and indecision was now past. From a remark that
                     escaped Macao Joe at our first meeting, and which I forgot to mention in its
                     proper sequence, I was led to suspect that, once fully complicated in the
                     business of clandestinely conveying the unknown persons away from the port,
                     there would be serious difficulties in the way to defeat and utterly prevent me
                     from washing my hands of the matter at a word. The more I reflected upon his
                     words, and some subsequent precautions of Jeffers, the more I became convinced
                     of the justness of this conclusion.</p>
                  <p>The day following my interview with Miss Creighton upon the Hillwood bridge was
                     employed in bringing my part of the preparations to completeness. The vessel
                     was conveyed to me by sale, the instrument specifying that the payment of the
                     remainder of the purchase money, two-thirds of the whole, was to be made at
                     Singapore, whither Macao Joe was to accompany me in the felucca to receive it.
                     This was only a nominal transaction, to give a plausibility to the succeeding
                     steps. The vessel was furnished with no charts, chronometer or navigating
                     instruments of any kind, and the afternoon was employed in selecting and
                     purchasing suitable ones from the small assortment afforded in the<pb n="26-27"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000014" /> town. These were bought with funds furnished by
                     Macao Joe, who suggested that I should chaffer and beat down after the manner
                     of the trading masters of the port, though in reality the best should be
                     purchased without regard to cost.</p>
                  <p>In dealing with the subject before the Cape Town men and their associates, I
                     took the precaution to speak of the voyage as contingent entirely upon my
                     success in finding certain friends at Singapore willing to advance the money
                     for concluding the bargain, but named a sum offered to each for the run
                     thither. These preliminaries despatched, I had nothing more to do but wait till
                     Jeffers recovered from his drunkenness sufficiently to say what should be the
                     next move on the card. While this last named individual was incapacitated from
                     his duties as "master of ceremonies," I was left entirely alone, as Macao Joe
                     informed me it would be more prudent for him also not to be seen too much in my
                     company. Said he:</p>
                  <p>"I no see you no more now much; dis small town not like big city. Ebbry body
                     watch odder mans, and talk, talk, all de time he too much talkee. Peeples tink
                     now you buy de ship; den dey say 'Macao Joe he guine fool dat young man outen
                     money.' But if you an' me guine knock about togedder much, dey say 'dat young
                     man no fool, he an' Macao Joe up to some big debbilment.' Den come some de
                     king's officer, an' watch and spy all de time."</p>
                  <p>This sounded highly plausible, and I hastened to assure him that I did not
                     yearn to be seen in his company a moment more than was necessary, even in such
                     an undiscriminating community as that in Putterum.</p>
                  <p>I did not consider it advisable to tell the men the nature of the expedition in
                     the light in which I viewed it. Nor was it necessary as a matter of justice
                     toward them, for there was no probability of their being held in any way
                     accountable by the "powers that be" in case of failure; and, further, I knew
                     that there was nothing more suitable to their present inclinations and
                     circumstances than a trip like the one now projected. There was no other
                     deception, for the (to them) important part of the agreement was the passage to
                     Singapore, which I <choice>

                     noticed the cabin was fitted up luxuriously, and a bulkhead had been put up in
                     the large cabin, thus dividing it in two compartments. These general
                     alterations suggested the conclusion that my passengers were persons of wealth
                     and refinement, and moreover meant to remain in strict seclusion.</p>
                  <p>On returning from the felucca after this visit, I found a note from the consul
                     waiting for me at the hotel. I proceeded to the consulate forthwith. After
                     salutations, he said:</p>
                  <p>"I am requested to make some inquiries about you—from a high quarter at that;
                     no less a personage than the Vizier, and, of course, this is the result of
                     something you have been doing. What is it?"</p>
                  <p>"I've done nothing that should excite any such idle curiosity."</p>
                  <p>"They are not much given to idle curiosity up there on the hill; but as every
                     man who is not a common sailor in appearance—or in fact any stranger who
                     appears to have means and no <choice>
                        <sic>busines</sic>
                        <corr>business</corr>
                     </choice> object—is at once subjected to scrutiny, you, of course, come in for
                     the same, as that is about your status here. They know full well that Putterrum
                     is not a resort for tourists and invalids, nor has it many claims to the
                     attention of the traveling public in point of convenience, curiosities, beauty
                     of scenery, or matters of local interest, historical or otherwise. Consequently
                     when a decently-dressed person arrives and gives evidence of having ready money
                     at his command, and the object of his appearance here does not become shortly
                     evident, it is a practice of the Vizier to <choice>
                        <sic>acertain</sic>
                        <corr>ascertain</corr>
                     </choice>, through the consul of his country, who he is and what he wants. The
                     present, and I might say the usual condition of our political relations renders
                     this course imperatively necessary; and therefore it should be met with
                     reciprocal frankness on the part of those who are unconnected with any sinister
                     purpose."</p>
                  <p>He made these remarks reclining backward in a large cane chair, keeping me
                     under a steady glance during them. I had become satisfied long ere he concluded
                     that he suspected me of being employed as I was.</p>
                  <p>"If the condition of affairs here renders such vigilance requisite," I
                     answered, "I am frank to say that I shall get out of the port as soon as my
                     arrangements are completed."</p>
                  <p>"May I ask if you have any objections to answer a few interrogations?"</p>
                  <p>"None in the least. I will answer them with pleasure; if it will relieve me
                     from the suspicion of the government, which strikes me as being at once
                     extremely absurd and somewhat dangerous to me."</p>
                  <p>"It is perhaps amusing, and also, as you say, dangerous, in some degree,
                     viewing the utter want of a systematic and equitable method of adjusting
                     matters of this nature; but I think it is in my power to relieve you at once of
                     this state of things, if you answer a few questions freely and frankly."</p>
                  <p>"I will do that," I replied.</p>
                  <p>"What are the arrangements of which you mean to hasten the completion?" said
                     the consul, taking snuff from a gold snuff-box of native manufacture.</p>
                  <p>"The fitting up of a vessel which I have agreed to take off the hands of the
                     present owner on or before my arrival at Singapore, a small portion of the
                     purchase money being paid down to bind the bargain."</p>
                  <p>"Who is the person selling?"</p>
                  <p>"A person called Macao Joe."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! And the vessel?"</p>
                  <p>"The Nautch Girl."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! Have you had any applications from persons wishing to take passage by the
                     vessel?"</p>
                  <p>"No, not yet."</p>
                  <p>"Do you expect to-take any should they apply?"</p>
                  <p>"I would do so, if it were necessary, or very much desired."</p>
                  <p>There was a silence. I saw that he was revolving something important in his
                     mind. I had thrown dust in his eyes so far. He looked steadily at a paper in
                     his hand and said:</p>
                  <p>"You intend, I presume, to take out certain papers for the vessel here?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I have but one suggestion to make, and as you heed or disregard it will
                     you escape or encounter difficulties in clearing the vessel from this
                     port—difficulties that are not easily surmounted, and that involve great
                     expense and delay. I do not presume that the few passengers that you could
                     accomodate would repay you for the risk of such contingencies, even though they
                     paid ten times the usual passage money. The suggestion I make is this, that you
                     immediately notify me if there be any<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6013-00000015" />
                     applications for the cabin of the Nautch Girl. I advise you to take none at
                     all, but particularly to advise me forthwith if any one should apply. This is
                     merely a proceeding of mine to prevent a great deal of possible mischief; but a
                     matter that you, of course, can take no interest in, nor even need understand.
                     That is about all."</p>
                  <p>I rose to depart just as his clerk and a sort of confidential adviser came
                     in.</p>
                  <p>"I understand enough to take care that I do not entangle myself in any of these
                     matters. If any person does apply for passage I will let you know." Thus
                     assuring him, I walked out of his office.</p>
                  <p>"Very <choice>
                        <sic>grod</sic>
                        <corr>good</corr>
                     </choice>, there will be no trouble with you, I think."</p>
                  <p>On passing out he said to the clerk, audibly enough for me to hear, though it
                     was not so meant:</p>
                  <p>"It's nothing but one of Macao Joe's transactions, and not likely to be
                     anything else."</p>
                  <p>I had learned that this consular agent had demanded the discharge of the bark's
                     men, alluded to in the beginning merely, only to gratify a <choice>
                        <sic>litte</sic>
                        <corr>little</corr>
                     </choice> personal pique, which resulted from the captain's refusing to tender
                     a sufficient bribe. On our arrival the captain of the bark consulted the agent
                     as to how he should keep the men, who were not regularly shipped for the
                     voyage. The agent's reply was: "It will cost you something." Whereupon the
                     captain answered that it "was too small a matter to cost much, and that he
                     would keep them anyhow." But for this occurrence, they might have been kept on
                     board until a more serious mutiny involved them criminally.</p>

                  <p>The next day Jeffers stood before me a sober man. He said he had been a "little
                     unwell," and had kept his house. Everything was new in readiness. A cook had
                     been shipped, and the men's names were all upon the felucca's papers.</p>
                  <p>"To-night," said Jeffers, "you will drop down on the first of the ebb till you
                     get abreast of that thick clump of jungle below the Iron Pot, when you will let
                     go a kedge in about four fathoms water—that is, some two or three hundred yards
                     from the beach. When you are hailed, 'Is that the Santa Anna?' that will be the
                     parties who want your service. You can answer, of course, 'No, this is the
                     Nautch <choice>
                        <sic>Giel</sic>
                        <corr>Girl</corr>
                     </choice>. The Santa Anna lies further out.' This is for the edification of the
                     patrol bangkongs, if any be about. The party will leave the Iron Pot first. The
                     Santa Anna is a whale ship and is to be condemned. Her men are ashore every
                     night. This is all. I have made all arrangements. Macao Joe will go as mate.
                     Did you ship a cook I sent you?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, a Mauritius negro."</p>
                  <p>"He is a good cook, and can prepare very superior dishes; in fact, he has been
                     mostly on steamers and big ships. He will go as cook and steward for the cabin.
                     A cook for the men will be sent off before night,"</p>
                  <p>"I have nothing to do now," said I but to take the chronometer on board and am
                     committed to the enterprise beyond withdrawal. You can safely confide in me
                     those particulars that have till now been withheld, for I shall not waver or
                     attempt to back out, you may depend upon it."</p>
                  <p>He looked at me fixedly for a moment, and shook his head.</p>
                  <p>"Not yet, you had better not know; it can be shown, in case of failure, that
                     you did not know."</p>
                  <p>"It will be difficult to escape death even then, for you and I and the others,
                     at least some of them."</p>
                  <p>He paused again and an expression of mingled pain and disappointment, I
                     thought, passed over his handsome but haggard-looking features tures. His eyes
                     wandered about the room, then glared out of the window upon the bay, which
                     glittered brightly in the morning sun.</p>
                  <p>In this narration I have gone over the first and even all portions of my
                     intercourse with Jeffers very briefly, more so than was in reality the manner
                     and character of it. I had met him at the Sicundar Bagh and elsewhere in our
                     short acquaintance on occasions other than those mentioned here; but those
                     interviews containing nothing specially <choice>
                        <sic>revelant</sic>
                        <corr>relevant</corr>
                     </choice> to these incidents, have not been introduced in this tale. Throughout
                     the whole, however, I did not fail to perceive that under his off-hand,
                     careless, man about-town demeanor there lurked a painful remembrance of
                     something past, and at times his eyes held an expression, a sort of shadow of
                     what was yet to come. At first I ascribed it to that ever-present phantom which
                     calls out, ever and anon, through the waking hours, "It might have been." But,
                     as subsequent meetings gave me a nearer view of his character, I felt that he
                     was one trying to awake to the realization of a long-cherished delusion, and
                     dreading the approach of an event which till now seemed remote or improbable.
                     What this phantom of misery might be I could not conjecture from so limited an
                     acquaintance with him. Nor did I seek further than to speculate upon its
                     connection with the coming departure. With no knowledge of his antecedent
                     career, however, I could in no way connect them satisfactorily.</p>
                  <p>He continued looking out upon the water with an absent manner, though the
                     muscles of his mouth twitched nervously. It might have been merely an unstrung
                     condition of the nerves from his late debauch, or it might have been the mental
                     torture of a man who was drawing near to a future that shadowed forth nothing
                     but unrest. I thought it was the latter.</p>
                  <p>Turning from the window at length he said:</p>
                  <p>"The Consul sent for you yesterday, didn't he?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes." I then narrated what had passed there.</p>
                  <p>"He is a blister," he said at the conclusion, "and wishes to become of great
                     importance in the port.—Bah!"</p>
                  <p>"Any trouble to be apprehended from him?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"None whatever. He hasn't brains enough to be formidable, and besides you have
                     put him to sleep."</p>
                  <p>"There is nothing more to talk of now, is there, connected with the business?"
                     I said, after another silence, in which he had turned to the window.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing more. I have prepared all things that can be touched now. The play is
                     ready for the stage, and at about an hour before midnight the curtain will rise
                     on the first performance."</p>
                  <p>"There is a long hiatus, till then, to be filled up," I said:</p>
                  <p>"I am going to sleep," he replied, and turned to leave; "If" he said, turning
                     in the doorway, "if there should be a noise on the beach and a pistol fired
                     twice out of the window of the 'Iron Pot,' you can do what you think best,
                     abandon the vessel, or try to run out with her, anything you please, for the
                     fort will probably begin to fire on you." And he departed.</p>
                  <p>Left alone I turned to the window, and mused upon the incidents of the past few
                     days. I wanted to go on board and remain; for the town had become almost
                     intolerable to me; yet I hesitated to leave the beach, to relinquish my hold
                     upon the land that held the only woman I had ever loved, and one that I loved
                     with a passion as intense and<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6013-00000016" />
                     tumultuous as it was novel. What would I not have given for one more interview
                     with her, or even another rapid, fleeting glance at that bold, beautiful face!
                     It was the face of a woman possessing all the elements of heroism, made bold by
                     the circumstances and events of an uncongenial life, yet with all the
                     brightness and softness of her sweet youth yearning for a calmer life of
                     love.</p>
                  <p>I ran over in my mind each word of our strange interview, and recalled her
                     rapidly changing expression, saw again before me those deep azure eyes beaming
                     with fire, or melting with the all-pervading love of maidenhood—waiting to be
                     drawn toward and poured out lavishly upon the object of his souls devotion. Had
                     I trod upon the confines of that glorious realization? I felt that I was nearer
                     to the possession of that heart's wealth than reason dared to acknowledge. But
                     it was gone. I was acting in the present mysterious affair solely upon her
                     bidding. I had favored the proposition first from motives of gain alone; but
                     now, but for her earnest injunction to go forward with my part of the
                     agreement, all the Nautch Girls, animate or inanimate, all that ever floated on
                     the blue buoyant billow or floated in the voluptuous measures of their own
                     peculiar dance in palace halls, would not have tempted me to sunder myself,
                     forever from the island that was her home, from the sweet hope of meeting and
                     knowing her again, however fruitless the meeting might be.</p>
                  <p>Another thought hung like a pall of darkness over what few feeble hopes strove
                     still to rise. The Rajah—to him she would be <choice>
                        <sic>saarificed</sic>
                        <corr>sacrificed</corr>
                     </choice>. I scouted at the clerks expressed belief that she would go a willing
                     sacrifice to the arms of that old barbarian sensualist. That remark irritated
                     me every time I recalled it. But what was the alternative of refusing a
                     father's life, a father's honor and pride of affluence? It was the old
                     story.</p>
                  <p>I would have gone to the hill road once more, but for her last injunction to
                     the contrary. She knew that I would come again, and bade me not. She knew that
                     I loved her. All the savor of life was gone; the beauty and loveliness had
                     passed away from the future. I went on board like one going to spend his life
                     in a wilderness. It was a strange thing for one of my temperament to do; but I
                     went, and hoped to forget her.</p>
                  <p>Before I went on board I wrote a few lines to Miss Creighton, and sent the note
                     by the smallest boy that I could pick up in the street. That there might be no
                     risk of its being intercepted, I saw him enter the house, and rewarded him with
                     a rupee for giving it into her own hands, on his return. It was a very
                     non-committal love-letter, indeed. It merely expressed, guardedly, my distaste
                     at the idea of leaving Putterrum in the mysterious manner contemplated, and
                     hinted at the possibility of my speedy return. It formally expressed a hope
                     that she was not connected in any way with the affair, for I had grave <choice>

                     </choice> of its being as honorable an enterprise as she had thought, and
                     feared that she had been misled in regard to it herself. But in case of failure
                     she might rely implicitly upon my secresy respecting her cognizance of it. This
                     was all.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IX.—NIGHT FALLS.</head>
                  <p>I was just the man for the expedition. I was anxious that the affair should be
                     successful in its termination, but cared really as little for any risk that I
                     might be taking upon myself as I cared for the political future of the
                     principality of Putterrum. In truth, a disastrous termination of the night's
                     work before fore me would, I felt, have been borne with a small grain of
                     satisfaction, as it would give me the hope of seeing her once more. I laid down
                     upon a sofa in the forward cabin, after leaving orders with the second mate to
                     call me when the tide turned to ebb. I tried to sleep away the few hours
                     remaining, knowing that I must be on deck all that night and possibly the next
                     but chiefly to escape from the glamour of despondency that was on me.</p>
                  <p>I dreamed of Fannie Creighton. In fact, sleep did not come with its healing
                     oblivion until my thoughts settled upon a hopeful tissue of fancies woven in
                     with her bright face. My dream was singularly distinct. I shall never forget
                     it. It was divided into three fleeting visions.—First I saw her on board the
                     Nautch Girl, sitting a few feet from me in a corner of the little after-cabin.
                     Her face was hid in her hands, and her bosom heaved; she was weeping. I was
                     awakened suddenly by the steward placing coffee upon the table. He apologised
                     for waking me, and asked if I would have supper; not wishing anything, I slept
                     again. Then came a vision of confusion, and fighting; it seemed that we had
                     been boarded and swarthy foes were all around me with kreeses. Somewhere in the
                     scene was Jeffers, with his features horribly distorted with fury and
                     excitement. It appeared that he was arrayed against me, for I met him, he
                     pointed a pistol at me, but it missed fire. I felt myself wounded. It was the
                     most perfect semblance of reality that car be imagined, and had all the
                     sensation and pain of the real act. Then I felt heavy, as if loaded with
                     chains. This period seemed much longer than the others. Then I saw her again,
                     arrayed in bridal robes, her deep blue eyes brighter and deeper than the
                     diamonds and sapphires she wore.</p>
                  <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6013-00000017" />
                  <p>"It's the fast of the ebb, now, sir."</p>
                  <p>I awoke, and there came upon me a presentiment strong and sufficient that
                     disaster and failure would threaten me. It carried with it, however, the
                     certain solace that I should see her again.</p>
                  <p>"How's the wind, Kitler?" I said, springing up.</p>
                  <p>"Right after us, sir, what little there is, but it will freshen a bit before
                     morning, I think."</p>
                  <p>I went on deck with very unusual sensations. The lights glimmered about on the
                     water, and the town was seen only as an irregular string of lights. Dull and
                     redly at the lower extremity of it glimmered the beacon light in the vicinity
                     of the Iron Pot.</p>
                  <p>"Loose the foresail and mainsail; loose the jib one hand, and stand by, the
                     rest of you, to pick up the anchor."</p>
                  <p>We were riding to a heavy kedge, the anchor that had been down previously
                     having been got on the bows at sundown; and the coir hawser then holding her
                     was bitted and extending aft, with a few turns around the capstan. Nothing was
                     to do but man the capstan, and walk her up to it. Round went the men in
                     silence, and save the scuffling tramp of their feet, all was still.</p>
                  <p>"Are you hove short yet?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, right up and down, now."</p>
                  <p>"Down foresail, then. Run up the jib, two of you. Starboard your wheel,
                     there."</p>
                  <p>"Hard a starboard, sir."</p>
                  <p>The kedge, broken from its hold, was run swiftly up to the bows.</p>
                  <p>A light fanning breeze that scarce sufficed to ruffle the great triangular
                     lateen foresail, looming through the night like a spectral glazier, wafted us
                     silently down past the shipping of the port. Going out with the tide," I
                     thought. "Whither?" Aye, in this life are we not always going out with the
                     tide, that tide that has no flow? Will tomorrow find us on the deck of this
                     gallant little vessel, springing over the blue billows, or will the setting sun
                     find me in the Rajah's fort out on the point, with a black, lank-haired sentry
                     looking in at my cell-grating occasionally?"</p>
                  <p>We drifted on, close aboard a huge country ship, just arrived from Goree with
                     cattle. The lowing and struggling of the poor brutes in their confined places,
                     mingled with the jabbering of her numerous Lascar crew, fell curiously on the
                     ear at that time. Then came a few low native vessels, prahus, cougnars, and gay
                     diangs. Then came a large, homely-looking junk, looming up grandly over the
                     surrounding craft; and all heavily manned, for mankind is cheap and plentiful
                     in these waters, such mankind as it is. We passed on our way. The bark I came
                     in was still in port, and appeared and vanished in turn with the others.
                     Another whaleship loomed past as, but not a sound was audible on board. It was
                     not unlikely that all hands, the anchor-<choice>
                        <sic>wotch</sic>
                        <corr>watch</corr>
                     </choice> included, were asleep. It was the Santa Anna.</p>
                  <p>"The grand panorama of Putterrum," I thought bitterly, "to conclude with an
                     exciting naval combat, Greek fire, slow music, and lights
                        <unclear>half</unclear> down, and grand tableaux, after which the entire
                     troupe will go through the interesting calisthenic exercises of hackleing coir
                     in the fort-yard, and perhaps perform some high tragedy far more entertaining
                     to the spectators than the performers." I felt an inclination to loosen my
                     cravat fancying that I felt a bowstring lying lightly thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>The cruisers, belonging to the Dutch Company then came into view. Bluff-bowed
                     and lumberingly built, they lay on the water like huge hearses, with deck and
                     gangway lanterns sending out a solemn glimmer; and their officers on the
                     quarter-deck talking of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in all probability.</p>
                  <p>Away off to the <choice>
                        <sic>starboark</sic>
                        <corr>starboard</corr>
                     </choice> lay a Yankee trading schooner, Her light, and that of the beacon,
                     would make the line on which I decided to come to anchor; thus bringing the
                     felucca about off the beginning of the uninhabited part of the beach, as
                     Jeffers directed. A few straggling lights could be seen, trending away toward
                     the beacon, while a dark strip intervening, indicated the point whence would
                     come the boat. The helm was put a little to port, as we came closer in to
                     shore.</p>
                  <p>"Heave the lead there, one of you."</p>
                  <p>"And a quarter, six," called out the leadsman.</p>
                  <p>"Haul up foresail, Another cast. Keep it a-going."</p>
                  <p>"By the mark—six."</p>
                  <p>"That will do the foresail; stand by to let go that kedge."</p>
                  <p>"Quarter less six."</p>
                  <p>"Let her come up more," to the helmsman.</p>
                  <p>"And a half-five."</p>
                  <p>"Let go."</p>
                  <p>And without any clatter or noise the kedge sank to the bottom, for it had not
                     been lifted above the surface, and the coir hawser slipped out noiselessly
                     through the hawse-pipe.</p>
                  <p>"Now," thought I, we shall see what we shall see, shortly."</p>
                  <p>The channel beacon-light was now but a short distance off, glimmering like a
                     dull red moon over the water It was of no consequence as a landmark to get in
                     or out of the port by for small vessels; none but the deeply laden bullock
                     droghers requiring to take any thought of the channel or the bar.</p>
                  <p>There was a cheeping of ropes and rattling of matting sails, mingled with
                     voices slightly audible, and growing nearer. It came, how<pb n="34-35"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000018" /> over, not from the darkened line of beach, but
                     from the direction of the bar. It was a prahu coming in. She passed along
                     within easy hail, and it was a wonder they did not hail us to enquire the state
                     of the markets. Then again all was silent, save the rustling of the felucca's
                     sails hanging loosely in the buntlines. We listened attentively, but nothing
                     was heard but the low plash of the waves, sullenly and slowly falling away from
                     the beach as the tide ran out.</p>
                  <p>Some minutes had now elapsed since the kedge was let go, and no indication of
                     any boat from shore.</p>
                  <p>The sound of oars at length was heard, and as it drew nearer it proved likewise
                     from the wrong direction, for it came from the shipping above. Suddenly a light
                     flashed over the waves, and we were in the rays of a powerful lantern. Then
                     suddenly all was dark again, and the beams reached out into the bay in the
                     opposite direction. It was the patrol boat. It too passed by, and disappeared
                     on its rounds of tomfoolery, for harbor thieves and pirates were as plentiful
                     as though such a force as the harbor-guard never had existence; and very little
                     did such gentry care for that same boat and its partner, if an opportunity
                     offered for pillaging a vessel.</p>
                  <p>Again the sound of oars, and from the beach this time. Sweeps rather, for a
                     rumbling like to a small lighter was the nature of the noise, plain and
                     unmistakable. There came a shadow in the beacon's red ray, and a hail, low but
                     distinct, and a voice that I well knew. It was Jeffers.</p>
                  <p>"Ahoy, there."</p>
                  <p>"Aye, aye."</p>
                  <p>"Where's the patrol boat?"</p>
                  <p>"Just passed down the bay toward the fort," I answered in a low voice.</p>
                  <p>"All right. Ship in your oars."</p>
                  <p>A small lighter, such as was chiefly ly used in discharging coastwise freight,
                     now came alongside. There was some little awkward clashing of the sweeps, which
                     brought forth from Macao Joe a few turgid oaths in a low tone.</p>
                  <p>Some one handed a light over the side.</p>
                  <p>"Take that infernal lantern inboard again," said Jeffers, "do you want the
                     patrol boat down here again?"</p>
                  <p>By its light I saw a small barge full of the hardest-looking scoundrels that it
                     had ever been my lot to behold. They seemed, in my brief glance, to have been
                     selected exclusively with reference to their hideous and diabolical aspect.
                     Rascality was stamped in every line of their faces.</p>
                  <p>In the stern sat Jeffers and his factotum, with a few bundles of luggage behind
                     them. The natives, gathering their bags and wallets of clothing, clambered over
                     the rail without more ado; and a general fire of native jabbering followed, as
                     they cast about for accommodations down below and about the head and forward
                     part of the vessel.</p>
                  <p>Jeffers and Macao Joe threw on board their luggage, and followed it when the
                     lighter was cast adrift. I had looked in vain for the unknown refugees, and
                     said:</p>
                  <p>"Where are the political refugees, or is that small shoal of the devil's
                     kinsfolk, the one for whom you have made all these preparations?"</p>
                  <p>"Scarcely," he answered, without looking from the direction of the shore. I did
                     not like nor understand this new addition to the felucca's crew, for the men
                     that I had supplied were sufficient to work her, and no more could be
                     necessary, as I understood the object of the cruise.</p>
                  <p>"What new phase of the proceedings has rendered it requisite to ship any more
                     men?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, it's all right; this is a part of the programme," he answered.</p>
                  <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6013-00000019" />
                  <p>"I am surprised, however," I replied, "that you did not mention it."</p>
                  <p>"There may be use for a large crew, and if there is not no harm will be done.
                     You are the first master of a vessel I ever saw who objected to a numerous crew
                     who cost nothing."</p>
                  <p>"They will not mess with your men," he added, "but keep aloof, that they may
                     not loose caste."</p>
                  <p>There was a grin on his features as he made this allusion to the peculiarity of
                     certain of the castes but it was transient, and the old rocky expression
                     settled back again instantly.</p>
                  <p>"They are coming at last," I said, as the cheep of oars was heard.</p>
                  <p>"Dat so! I give de kedge up den;" and Macao Joe moved forward among his crew
                     with the necessary orders.</p>
                  <p>A small shore boat or gig slipped alongside and shipped in the oars
                     noiselessly. I had but time to discern four figures in the stern sheets, when a
                     hail from the opposite direction fell sharply on all ears, and considerably
                     startled Jeffers and myself. What effect it had upon these in the boat I did
                     not remark but jumped upon the rail to answer it.</p>
                  <p>"On board that felucca, there," said a gruff voice.</p>
                  <p>"Aye, aye; what's wanting?" I answered sharply.</p>
                  <p>"Can you take my line till the tide turns? I've lost both anchors outside, and
                     cant fetch up to the town with this light breeze and the tide agin me."</p>

                  <p>Tar has been used immemorially in Medicine, and its merit is beyond dispute.
                     Many preparations are in the market, but only partly containing the right
                     properties, have not the desired effect. By our careful method of preparation
                     we obtain ALL the Medicinal properties of the Pine Tree in the highest degree,
                     and as the Medicine in color and clearness resembles Wine, we have selected
                     "Wine of Tar" for its name and "trade mark."</p>
                  <p>Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar</p>
                  <p>Is Alterative, Sedative, Tonic and Expectorant. It is a wonderful curative in
                     all Throat and Lung diseases—allaying all irritation and removing phlegm and
                     other morbid secretions from the Throat and air passages, giving health and
                     vitality to the Lungs themselves, and enabling them to more thoroughly remove
                     from the blood the diseased and impure particles which, if retained, render
                     life one of misery, and lay the foundation for incurable consumption.</p>

                     the yards swung slowly round for another tack. She hung in stays some little
                     time, her sails aback and the reefpoints rattling against them as they lifted
                     and shivered in the faint breeze, but filled away at last, and disappeared in
                     the darkness.</p>
                  <p>"A lime-juicer," said Macao Joe, (a nickname among seamen for an English

                     'John Bull's bellowing calves of the ocean."</p>
                  <p>"Some debbilment been kick up outside, certain," said Macao Joe in a knowing
                     tone of voice.</p>
                  <p>"Down foresail," was the order. as the kedge again broke ground. "Down
                     mainsail—square in the yards—loose the driver." And we were off at last,
                     sweeping along with the tide and a mild steady breeze. The boat which brought
                     the last-comers was not cast adrift. but dropped astern. After replying to the
                     query from the English brig I came to the companion-way to see the
                     all-important people in whose employ I was. The last of the four was just
                     descending. He was a wiry-faced native, about fifty years old or thereabouts,
                     and was very neatly but plainly dressed in the costume of a Parsee.</p>
                  <p>I glanced down into the after-cabin through the skylight. One of the three was
                     a European. His back was turned to me, but the other two were plainly in view.
                     They appeared to be a couple of young native bucks of the wealthy class, and
                     were attired in the latest English fashions from Singapore.—Their small,
                     useless hands were bedizzened with jewelled rings, which sparkled in the light
                     of the cabin lamps, as they raised them to remove occasionally their
                     cigarettes. Both wore fine slouched hats, which shaded and partly concealed
                     their faces from my view, though I could see that they wanted but a few shades
                     of being as dark as negroes. The features of both, though good of a certain
                     kind, had a cruel, unpleasant expression, to say no more. They were jabbering
                     together in the<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6013-00000020" /> native tongue, but I
                     did not hear distinctly, not did I wish to play eavesdropper. The only thing
                     that impressed me favorably toward them was the singularly clear and melodious
                     voices which both had—one in a marked degree. The steward was handing coffee
                     and refreshments with great unction, knowing and appreciating their high caste
                     and consequence more than I did.—For him it was well enough, but I viewed them
                     as a brace of undersized, effeminate unprincipled young knaves, wealthy beyond
                     all reason, and in danger now through their own profligacy; and nothing else. I
                     am writing this precisely as I felt at the time, the better to picture the
                     incidents as they existed, and the current of emotions properly belonging to
                     each.</p>
                  <p>The European of the party poured out a glass of brandy from a decanter that
                     swung in a rack overhead. In turning to replace it he turned his face full in
                     the light. It was the merchant, the father of Fanny Creighton. Everything
                     dawned upon me at once. The daughter had been sold to purchase the father's
                     departure home with his wealth. Then the query suggested itself, "why does he
                     leave so secretly?" Perhaps it was inexpedient to remove her now. Then what
                     folly was manifest in leaving her to the rapacity of a despotic barbarian
                     ruler, who owned the very lives of his subjects, and to whom consuls and
                     official residents bowed and pandered that they might not be hindered in their
                     gold getting!</p>
                  <p>She was gone. I had no hope to build a hope on, but nevertheless I felt
                     indignant that the one solitary person in this world, or this part of the
                     world, to whom she could appeal, with the sanction of law and custom, was now
                     stealing away in company with his companions in crime, his dissipated clerk,
                     his riff-raff crew, and she left behind alone. I had a strong impulse to run
                     the felucca into the Rajah's small fleet—we were then passing it—and denounce
                     all hands, myself included, to the first one within hail. This feeling was in
                     part dispelled, however, as I remembered her last words on the hillroad bridge.
                     Hoping that all might prove in time to be for the best, I turned away to attend
                     to the vessel, satisfied, however, on one point, that Miss Creighton was in
                     great danger. Whatever was the cause of her being left, I hoped it was better
                     than it appeared on the surface just then, and walked to the binnacle to note
                     the bearing of the port light, as a point of departure.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER X.—MR. CREIGHTON.</head>
                  <p>Macao Joe was getting the anchors secured, and everything made snug forward.
                     Jeffers was walking up and down the quarter deck. He went to the companion way
                     as though called thither; and a conversation between himself and one of the
                     younger passengers, as I knew by the nearly inaudible voice, took place.</p>
                  <p>"More dark lantern business," I thought. The talk was short, and terminated by
                     Jeffers' habitual, "Very good." As he turned away and came to where I was. I
                     asked:</p>
                  <p>"Who are your 'other friends,' Mr. Jeffers?"</p>
                  <p>"For the present it is thought expedient that they remain <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">incog</foreign>.—Recollect that we're not out of the
                     wilderness yet, therefore they choose not to be known by any one who might
                     recognize them again." He said this with a matter-of-fact manner that carried
                     plausibility with every word, though it proved to be a mere excuse for his
                     refusal.</p>
                  <p>"Jeffers," said an authoritative voice. I turned, and saw Mr. Creighton
                     standing with his head out of the after-companion way.—Jeffers approached
                     without answering, and the former continued:—"Are you getting the guns out and
                     ready?"</p>
                  <p>"No sir, not yet; Macao Joe is forward with the men, at work there."</p>
                  <p>"My goodness, man, how long will it take to get those guns ready?"</p>
                  <p>"Not long; there's no sea, and won't be for hours yet; this bank runs out
                     nearly forty miles, with only six to twelve fathoms of water on it; it will be
                     smooth as a mill-pond till we get into deeper water," said Jeffers.</p>
                  <p>"There is no time to waste. I want them ready now; our greatest danger is to
                     come yet," he answered, peevishly.</p>
                  <p>"The deuce it is," I thought, as Jeffers replied:</p>
                  <p>"There's nothing to do but knock to pieces the water-tanks and clap on the
                     tackles."</p>
                  <p>The guns were in raise-deck tanks. That was a very clever arrangement. I had
                     noticed the rather unusual size and height of these two tanks. They were
                     bottomless, it appeared, and each was set over an American-made gun, of
                     Dahlgreen's pattern, already mounted on its carriage. They were medium
                     thirty-two pounders.</p>
                  <p>The English merchant lowered his voice, and asked: "How does that young man
                     take matters. Cool, eh?"</p>
                  <p>"He's cool as need be about the business in hand, but he's worrying a little
                     about something else, I think," replied Jeffers, promptly.</p>
                  <p>"Humph. What do you think it is?"</p>
                  <p>"I'm rather inclined to believe that he has lost all his money gambling in
                     Putterrum."</p>
                  <p>The merchant replied:</p>
                  <p>"No, not at all, not at all. I know that well enough. Whatever it is, it has
                     not, probably, anything to do with this matter; and, therefore, is none of our
                     business, so he understands thoroughly what is before him, and is the man for
                     the pinch."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, when I spot a man, rest satisfied that he will answer for the work," said
                     Mr. Jeffers, in rather a vain-glorious tone.</p>
                  <p>"Well, let him get the guns ready, and have those American men to man them;
                     they are the ones. And by the way, Jeffers, it seems to me that you've got a
                     great gang of men there; more than was necessary."</p>
                  <p>"Not if we make a running fight of it, and something is shot away."</p>
                  <p>"Well, perhaps not." And Mr. Creighton disappeared down the companion-way
                     again."</p>
                  <p>This conversation was afterwards reported to me by one of my men who was at the
                     helm. Jeffers spoke to me regarding the guns; and Macao Joe was at the work
                     with his gang in a trice. In a few minutes they stood revealed in position,
                     looking over either rail, with breechings and tackles complete.</p>
                  <p>"Good evening, captain."</p>
                  <p>I turned to the speaker; it was the merchant. He offered his hand, saying:</p>
                  <p>"I call you captain, though we're all captains after a fashion; but I believe
                     strongly in the truth of the proverb which says, 'When there are many captains
                     the ship sinks,' and therefore, I now formally invest you with the command of
                     the vessel, and there shall be no interference till you desire it. What I want
                     of you is to put me on board of a homeward-bound English ship, and the lawful
                     ownership of the vessel will then accrue to you by agreement. To do this you
                     may have to fight a little at long range for a time; for no doubt one of the
                     Rajah's steamers, if not the whole fleet, will put after us before daylight. I
                     am exceedingly loth to fire a shot at them, but it<pb n="40-41"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000021" /> will not do to be overhauled; and if they find
                     that we are prepared to sprinkle a few balls in return at them, they will dog
                     along without coming up, until they are justified in putting back for want of
                     coal. You will find a successful termination of the trip much more profitable
                     than a 'little investment for the Singapore markets,'" he concluded, quoting my
                     words on the day of our first meeting.</p>
                  <p>I told him that I would spare no exertions to make the escape safely, and that
                     the men, those that I had shipped, would, I thought, like nothing better than a
                     frolic with one of the Rajah's cruisers. I then gave orders to get ammunition
                     and implements from below, and placed the second mate in charge of the
                     battery.</p>
                  <p>"It would have been rather an awkward business for us both, perhaps," continued
                     the merchant, "if I had sold you any of the packages of merchandise that were
                     piled up in my warehouse."</p>
                  <p>"Why?"</p>
                  <p>"They were mere rubbish, dummies, spice packages without, but chaff of one sort
                     and another within. So you understand now why I was rather short with you that
                     morning. I did not want so sharp a young fellow as you looked to be about the
                     floor at all; at least it was prudent not to sell any small lots, as I had only
                     a certain per centage of genuine packages, and kept those for an
                     emergency."</p>
                  <p>"They will be lost. I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I've cut the Rajah out of those even, for I sold them yesterday afternoon,
                     for cash; and there will be but dry pickings for that hungry shoal of
                     adventurers around the palace."</p>
                  <p>"Adventurers"—he said the word with all the hearty hatred of a wealthy
                     Englishman toward that class of the world's children. No people as a nation,
                     furnish such a large percentage of these rambling individuals as the British
                     Isles, yet none exhibit so much unqualified intolerance of all who are not well
                     known by "sombuddy at 'ome," as Mr. Bull.</p>
                  <p>It occurred to me just then, that considering his present position, with the
                     risks involved, and the antecedent doings, whatever they were, that out him off
                     from British protection, thus necessitating this surreptitious exit from the
                     city of Putterrum, the less he said disparagingly of adventurers the more
                     consistent and proper it would appear to the casual mind. I had noticed that
                     several men were employed in lifting out of his boat some weighty package, but
                     was too much occupied at the time to give it further attention. It was carried
                     into the cabin. I concluded that it was money.</p>
                  <p>"You leave nothing of importance in Putterrum then?" I asked, with a view of
                     leading him to a certain subject, to ascertain if he felt any twinges of
                     conscience at what I considered the basest desertion. But the reply was in
                     strict keeping with what had thus far been apparent, I was not greatly
                     astonished when he answered:</p>
                  <p>"Well, no; there were some sacrifices that were perhaps unpleasant, but
                     imperative—utterly so. Twenty years ago I might have thought more of those sort
                     of things, but at my time of life they go but for little."</p>
                  <p>The miserable old gold-worshiping wretch! I turned away across the deck with a
                     feeling of general contempt for every one on board the vessel, excepting the
                     few heedless souls composing "Gideon's band," who were at that time collected
                     in the waist, and speculating among themselves as to what "Doc and his crowd
                     were up to."</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XI.—WE PREPARE TO FIGHT.</head>
                  <p>I saw, from the ambiguous style of the merchant's last reply, that he did not
                     wish to continue the subject, and suggested that the men should be drilled a
                     little at the guns.</p>
                  <p>"A most excellent idea, indeed.—Should there be any occasion to use them—which
                     God avert!—a little timely practice with the implements now will prevent a vast
                     deal of confusion, and, perhaps, accident."</p>
                  <p>I gave the necessary orders to Kitler, the oldest of the man-of-wars men.</p>
                  <p>"Come, now, all of Gideon's Band, there's work for ye," said the latter, moving
                     toward the group of white men; "I'm going to let you into the way of handlin'
                     these champagne bottles."</p>
                  <p>"Tom, you take the stabb'rd one; Charlie, you the port gun."</p>
                  <p>"Stations were accorded, implements handed, and after some shoving about,
                     explanations and exclamations characteristic of such a scene, they got at the

                  <p>"Your men," said Mr. Creighton, "don't seem to be as good material for the guns
                     as I thought they would."</p>
                  <p>"Oh never fear for them when the pinch comes," I answered. "You will see them
                     handy enough in an emergency. The drill must be modified somewhat for the
                     occasion."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, something should be done, though I don't pretend to suggest what it
                     should be."</p>
                  <p>"The regulation drill of the navy contemplates more time than we are allowed to
                     acquire efficiency in."</p>
                  <p>"I presume so."</p>
                  <p>"I will simplify the exercises considerably without greatly impairing their
                     suitability for what may be demanded on this occasion."</p>
                  <p>"Do."</p>
                  <p>I saw that he had lost confidence entirely in my man's capabilities, for
                     serving the guns in any way; but I knew the man better than he did, and went to
                     one of the guns. They had ceased practice, and were involved in a disputation
                     in which some one was going to "bat" somebody else "right in the snoot."</p>
                  <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6013-00000022" />
                  <p>"I'll take the gun awhile, Tom," said I. "Attention."</p>
                  <p>The quarrel ceased after a word or two more.</p>
                  <p>"When, you hear the command, 'Starboard guns' crew, stand by!' you will take
                     your present positions; so remember them. Jim has the rammer till he is killed.
                     At the command 'Load,' you" pointing to a man, "go to the booby hatch and get a
                     cartridge from some one who will hand it up, and carry it to that man; he puts
                     it in the gun, and Jim rams it home, giving it two smart taps, thus. Then you,
                     Daley, get a shot from the tub, and stand by to hand it. And all get back to
                     your places when you are not required out of them."</p>
                  <p>A slight explanation like this, all the way through the exercise, from
                     "clearing away the gun," to securing the piece again, was sufficient for them,
                     now interested, and comprehending thoroughly what was wanted.</p>

                  <p>"They are doing well enough now, you see," I observed, as Creighton came up
                     from below after a time.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, yes; they seem to be going along smoothly enough now; but I protest I
                     thought at first they would ruin everything. Won't you join me in a glass of
                     most excellent brandy?"</p>
                  <p>I thought I would if it was unusually good.</p>
                  <p>"Ronak?"</p>
                  <p>The Parsee was his servant.</p>
                  <p>"Sahib," said the servant, emerging from below.</p>
                  <p>"Bring <emph>my</emph> brandy and glasses."</p>
                  <p>The tray was set upon the skylight-and we drank. The superintendence of the
                     vessel called me away for a short time. On my return aft, one of the "bucks"
                     before mentioned was walking up and down the lee side by himself. Jeffers was
                     watching the drill, and the merchant had retired below. I took a scrutinizing
                     glance at his face as he passed back and forth, through a broad ray from the
                     skylight. It was a face that I had met, but where? It haunted me, as it were,
                     for several minutes At last he crossed over the deck to where I was, and poured
                     out a small glass of the merchant's brandy, and took, as it appeared to me, a
                     very slight sip, then throwing his light military cloak off from one shoulder,
                     held out his jeweled hand, with:</p>
                  <p>"Good evening, captain; how far have we got from Putterrum? We are not off the
                     bank yet, and the wind don't appear to freshen any."</p>
                  <p>"The moon is rising now, though, and that much is satisfactory."</p>
                  <p>"Hardly. I should like it better if it was darker."</p>
                  <p>"Why?"</p>
                  <p>"Because we're on dark business, and to be in keeping with the 'eternal fitness
                     of things,' we should have a dark night."</p>
                  <p>"Do you know it is dark business?"</p>
                  <p>"No; but I should not call it the most open every day transaction in life."</p>
                  <p>"The 'dark business' may have been already done." And I thought of poor Fanny
                     and the life before her.</p>
                  <p>"And we all succeed keeping you in the dark pretty; well as to those matters,
                     oh? Is that what you would say if it came just right?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I am content to know no more than I now do of who we all are and what
                     we've all been doing." I answered moodily, for the voice of the speaker was low
                     and musical as the bass, strings of an Æolian harp, and carried me back to the
                     hill road interview, and the evident treachery of some kind toward that
                     forsaken young girl.</p>
                  <p>"Why, then, did you seek to know at first?"</p>
                  <p>"I was not aware that I did particularly. I felt a right."</p>
                  <p>"I thought you did at one time."</p>
                  <p>"Why, what do you know of me or my doings?" said I somewhat sharply.</p>
                  <p>"Don't you suppose you were watched after you were seen with Miss Creighton?
                     What a long talk you two did have then."</p>
                  <p>"And is that a sufficient cause for spying, in your city—being seen in
                     conversation with a young lady?"</p>
                  <p>"It depends altogether who the lady is," said he.</p>
                  <p>"What is the inference in this case?"</p>
                  <p>"The inference is that there is something on the board," he replied, in the
                     most careless manner imaginable, "that needs watching."</p>
                  <p>"Am I to understand you as referring to her or myself?"</p>
                  <p>"To her, of course, though you would be placed under <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >espionage</foreign> in consequence."</p>
                  <p>I regarded him as closely as the bright moonlight would permit while uttering
                     these words but saw nothing but an unreadable fixed expression on his dusky
                     face. His words sent a melancholy thrill through my breast, though a feeling of
                     anger was fast getting uppermost.</p>
                  <p>"And what resulted from the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">espionage?</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>"Several things were noted."</p>
                  <p>"Such as what?"</p>
                  <p>"One thing was certain, that you did seek another."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, are you sure of that?"</p>
                  <p>"Sure."</p>
                  <p>"And at whose instigation was I so closely watched?"</p>
                  <p>"That's not an admissable question, at present but they were those, who, for
                     their own benefit probably, were interested in your safety."</p>
                  <p>"Safety?"</p>
                  <p>"That's the word."</p>
                  <p>"What else was revealed by that honorable mode of proceeding."</p>
                  <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6013-00000023" />
                  <p>"My friend the end justifies the means."</p>
                  <p>"That is not sound ethics in my view, but what else was noted?"</p>
                  <p>"Secondly, that you entered with more earnestness of purpose into the business
                     of getting the vessel ready, and completing the details incident thereto."</p>
                  <p>"Who the devil can this be," I wondered. The voice was familiar, the accent
                     foreign, and strange in a certain way that is impossible to indicate by
                     letters; though his acquaintance with and command of English clearly indicated
                     much culture for a barbarian.</p>
                  <p>"Any other important discoveries?" I inquired, sarcastically.</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"I should be glad to hear them all."</p>
                  <p>"Very well; you were, notwithstanding all your activity, exceedingly loth to
                     leave Putterrum."</p>
                  <p>"This is the devil in disguise," I thought, now somewhat interested; but more
                     startling revelations were to come.</p>
                  <p>He lighted a cigarette, turning from me as he did so, evidently that I might
                     not from the light of the match see his face plainly.</p>
                  <p>"Never mind," I said to myself, "daylight will give us a chance to sum you
                     up."</p>
                  <p>"You mailed a letter to her, plainly revealing the extraordinary control which
                     she possessed over you, though you endeavored to conceal it in the manner of
                     the letter. With a woman of her subtlety there is no knowing what purpose she
                     has designed you for; but one thing was evident—that you were hound on the same
                     journey as the rest."</p>
                  <p>"The rest?" I repeated.</p>
                  <p>"That is if you return to Putterrum," he said, looking at me steadily in the
                     moonlight, and his eyes, I fancied, glistened with a sort of mysterious triumph
                     the while, as he continued: "And you know that you do intend to return, and
                     have up to this moment."</p>
                  <p>"And what if I return?" I said.</p>
                  <p>"You would not think of going back there if we escape safely?"</p>
                  <p>"I might. Never mind. Suppose I did," I answered in a stern voice; for without
                     being able to see why just then, I was getting in a very hot temper.</p>
                  <p>"You might escape, with great care, and many friends and much influence—you
                     might, but it is a chance in a thousand—you might elude the bowstring or
                     kreese, but you would go with the rest."</p>
                  <p>"What rest?"</p>
                  <p>"Those who sought her."</p>
                  <p>"And where did they go?" I exclaimed in a sharp tone that was wrung from me by
                     the pain his words caused.</p>
                  <p>He looked at me steadily, threw away the cigarette, drew his light cloak upon
                     his shoulder and said, slowly emphasizing each word,</p>
                  <p>"They missed her."</p>
                  <p>I took a turn up and down the quarter-deck and stopped in front of him. He was
                     lounging with his back against the companion-way, gazing vacantly up at the
                     moon.</p>
                  <p>"Here's another sharp intriguer around the petty principalities," I
                     thought.</p>
                  <p>"And what is the object of telling me all these things?" I asked, confronting
                     him.</p>
                  <p>"No object, specially. I think they came out in the common course of
                     conversation," he returned.</p>
                  <p>"But you have admitted many things that are not creditable, to say the
                     least."</p>
                  <p>"Opening letters in cases like that is perfectly justifiable. You can set it
                     down to the score of regard for yourself."</p>
                  <p>"For me?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"Why?"</p>
                  <p>"You are taking us safely out of Putterrum, you know!"</p>
                  <p>"For which I am to be liberally rewarded, I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"And that is solely what prompts you to run the risk of putting your neck in a
                     bow-string, is it?"</p>
                  <p>"No; if that was all, you'd be skulking about Putterrum now, and Jeffers still
                     on the scent for a smart fool in want of money."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, then, it must be friendship for Jeffers."</p>
                  <p>"Jeffers be hanged, and you, too. I can't exactly explain why it is, but I feel
                     very certain of it, that you are in some way antagonistic to Miss Creighton;
                     and her father being in your company, both of you hail follows together, just
                     out of some devilment—the Lord knows what—it does appear that he too has an
                     opinion of her similar to the one you express; or that you are putting yourself
                     in a very awkward position by speaking as you do."</p>
                  <p>"Why, my very excited friend and captain, without noticing your very coarse
                     remark, let me just say to you that her father and myself between us know what
                     she is. We speak of her occasionally. I make her wants known to him, and he
                     supplies the money for them. I disburse the larger portion of it—that's enough,
                     isn't it? So you now appreciate my disinterestedness, I hope; and don't let
                     yourself be any more disturbed about a miserable <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >intriguante</foreign> at a petty Indian court. But, by Jove! you are hit
                     hard. Fanny <emph>does</emph> play the deuce with a freshman. And so take the
                     advice of one who has spent a life in the atmosphere of Indian treachery and
                     intrigue, and one who has a growing esteem for you, and never think of going
                     back to Putterrum."</p>
                  <p>"My young blade," said I, with as much calmness as I could command, "I think
                     you have been laying it on a little too stoutly, to use a homely<pb n="46-47"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000024" /> but expressive phrase, and a few words will, I
                     think, enable you to understand me clearly. How far you and her father, and
                     that other imp down below, and others may be, have succeeded in involving a
                     young innocent and affectionate girl in your networks of intrigue and mystery,
                     I can't say. My acquaintance with her was casual, accidental, and unimportant,
                     in connection with what I am going to state. But whatever motive you may have
                     in trying to prejudice me against her, is entirely frustrated. She can't have
                     many friends when her father has forsaken her. It isn't the way of this world;
                     and as soon as you and the rest of the gang are out of this vessel, I am going
                     to bout ship and go back to Putterrum to investigate this most mysterious,
                     unnatural, and apparently despicable business; and, if she wants a friend,
                     having none better than I am, I will take care of her to the last of my life.
                     And furthermore, if you utter another word of implied aspersion of her
                     character in any way, I give it as my opinion that I shall put you over the
                     rail forthwith."</p>
                  <p>He drew off from me while uttering these words, and said:</p>
                  <p>"Good night, sir. We understand each other now, I think," and descended the
                     companion stairs.</p>
                  <p>I thought I heard a low laugh as he disappeared, but in my frame of mind I
                     could not heed anything particularly.</p>

                  <p>I paced the deck a few minutes in no very pleasant mood, when the helmsman
                     struck four bells and the wheel was relieved. The drilling at the guns had
                     ceased, and the men were grouped about, some of them leaning listlessly over
                     the bulwarks, talking in low tones as they watched the pale glimmering of the
                     water peculiar in these seas. Others were lying about the decks in corners out
                     of the moon's rays, sleeping. I descended to the forward cabin, examined the
                     barometer, looked at the chart, and determined the vessel's position on it. I
                     looked in at my stateroom door, and saw my straw valise, containing my scanty
                     wardrobe, lying just where it had been thrown when I first came on board the
                     day before.</p>
                  <p>Everything in the cabin was luxurious and inviting. I had not slept for three
                     days more than half dozen hours altogether. I was wretchedly tired, but knew
                     that it was useless to think of sleeping. Sleep would not come to me then.
                     Going on deck I beheld Jeffers, just awakened, in a low-toned earnest
                     conversation with Macao Joe in the waist by themselves. Then it was that a
                     presentiment took possession of my mind, from no apparent cause, that I was not
                     to come into possession of the vessel regularly as per agreement, without
                     trouble. It originated from no occurrence or change in the aspect of affairs
                     that I could define, as exciting it, nor was I able in reflecting upon all the
                     previous conversations and acts relative to the matter, to detect a single
                     circumstance that would rationally justify such a conclusion. The secresy
                     observed by all was perfectly consistent with the deportment to be expected in
                     such a clandestine departure as was ours. There was nothing in the demeanor of
                     Jeffers or Macao Joe, or their precautionary measures, but appeared demanded by
                     the circumstances to secure the safety of all. The undertaking was hazardous,
                     and required for the execution of it a person skilled in navigation and
                     seamanship, one suitable to command the obedience of seamen; and lastly, one
                     possessing enough of the sense of chivalry and decency to prevent him from
                     seeking to trade<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6013-00000025" /> on the confidence
                     necessarily reposed in him. I was flattered by their discrimination in my
                     favor. The price offered was large, but only in keeping with the importance of
                     success to and the wealth of the persons paying it.</p>
                  <p>I knew enough of the world to feel that there was but little
                        <emph>reasonable</emph> cause for apprehending a want of good faith toward
                     me. But in the face of these reflections came the presentiment that there would
                     be in attaining my right of property in the felucca, difficulties to surmount,
                     the nature of which I was totally unable to foresee. I had, without seeing the
                     names in papers that conveyed the vessel to me, perfect assurance from a source
                     which I relied upon, that all was regular and legitimate; the chain of title
                     perfect, and the contract fulfilled the moment that the passengers named in the
                     instrument placed their feet upon the dock of an English vessel, homeward
                     bound. "Whatever overreaching Messrs. Creighton &amp; Co. have been guilty of
                     in a general way, they are far from attempting any small trickery with me. It
                     isn't the way of this world, as I have learned it; let obstacles arise if they
                     must; sufficient unto the night are the evils thereof." And with these thoughts
                     I left the masts against which I had been leaning, and paced the deck.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIII.—(CONTINUED.)</head>
                  <p>At one point in every passage each way by the skylight I could see down into
                     the after-cabin, under the sash raised for ventilation. The lamp swung
                     languidly in the gimballs, and cast a clear light upon the two occupants. One
                     was Mr. Creighton sitting with his head and arm upon the table asleep. The
                     other was sitting back against the bulkhead, gazing intently at nothing. His
                     face wore the expression to me then of a man devising rascality. It was the
                     purser. The thoughts that were then current in his mind might have been, and
                     probably were, nothing more nefarious than reflections whether Miss Creighton
                     had placed her father's nankeens in the first box or the third box, or if the
                     linen jackets were convenient; for he did not have the packing of them.</p>
                  <p>But the foreboding alluded to had so tempered my mind with fanciful suspicions
                     that I dwelt, in spite of a disinclination to do so, upon the dismal prospect
                     of coming short of complete possession of the felucca just at a time when it
                     was the one thing needful for the purpose I had in view However much I may have
                     coveted the swift bark that was under my feet, with a sailor's and a rover's
                     appreciation of such things, in the opening of the events above related, the
                     revelations of the last half hour had increased my desire for speedy possession
                     a hundred fold. The lagging breeze chafed and irritated me. I was eager to have
                     the vessel back again upon the spot where she then was, but with her bows
                     cleaving the waves toward Putterrum. Impatient to be returning to steal away
                     the poor abandoned girl, or at least to offer her the choice between a stout
                     heart brim full of devotion, and a life wasted with hope wretchedly thrown
                     away. It never once occurred to me that the girl might have remained of her own
                     election; that the opportunity of tyrannizing over a superannuated love-smitten
                     rajah, ruling him and his people with all the attendant homage and Oriental
                     splendor, would be sufficient, of itself, to make almost any girl, not born to
                     better things "consider on it," at least. My thoughts never so much as skirted
                     along the margin of such a conception.</p>
                  <p>These events occurred more rap idly than would appear from the relation of
                     them, for when, after a few turns upon the deck, I noticed the clock in the
                     cabin, it seemed a long time, though but a few minutes had elapsed since the
                     conversation last recorded.</p>
                  <p>The night was getting chilly, a slight mist had risen on the water, and the dew
                     was heavy. I shut down the skylight frame and went forward, intending to look
                     out for the "little headland," as it was time that it should begin to loom
                     through the<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6013-00000026" /> night. The look out was
                     seated upon the pall-bitts, humming to himself some popular sentimental
                     air.</p>
                  <p>"Is that you, Prince?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                  <p>"See anything that looks like land yet?"</p>
                  <p>"I was wonderin' if that yonder was land or cloud bank, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, it's the little head,'" I said, gazing a moment.</p>
                  <p>"I was just going to pass the word aft about it," he continued; "but I was
                     watchin to make out if I saw a light. I thought I did—jest a minit it flashed
                     up and then went right out agin. I thort it was sing'lar."</p>
                  <p>"Keep a good lookout; it is probably a native craft out there somewhere. Where
                     was it?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"Right ahead, jest a little on the starboard. It jest flashed right up, and
                     went out agin, different from a common light aboard a ship."</p>
                  <p>I looked, but it was dark enough then. I went aft. In passing the forward
                     companion way my eye caught sight of a very small boot, and the leg belonging
                     to it, of some one sitting at my table, where the chart was unrolled. I knelt
                     down on the deck the better to see down into the cabin, and beheld the unknown
                     person with whom I had spoken of Miss Creighton. He was sitting in the corner
                     with his face buried in his hands, and I thought instantly of my dream. He was
                     either laughing or weeping, I could not at that distance determine which; but
                     the hands and head moved with the appearance of emotion. Slight though it was,
                     it convinced me that he was in tears. It was nothing to me how much he wept, or
                     what for, so I passed on.</p>
                  <p>Kittler suggested that he should drill the men again for a short time. I
                     consented. Drowsiness began at last to steal over me with a heaviness
                     proportionate to my broken rest of the last few days. I laid down on the cabin
                     trunk, with a block of cork for a pillow, not intending, however, to sleep.
                     Jeffers was in the waist acquiring the drill from observation; and Macao Joe
                     was in charge of the deck. The breeze had sprung up a very little, and the
                     sails were still.</p>
                  <p>The noise of the drilling grew more and more indistinct, as drowsiness stole
                     over my senses, though for some time a cloudy consciousness enabled me to hear
                     the clink clank of the rammer, and the commands, mingled with isolated words
                     now and then. I felt something upon me; I was too near dreamland to
                     investigate, but I felt a drowsy gratitude toward the considerate individual.
                     It was a mantle or shawl thrown over me.</p>
                  <p>The chilliness of the air was excluded, and I fell asleep. My dream was a
                     curious mixture of previous and present impressions upon the mind. Somewhere
                     before me I saw the Rajah, and heard him say, in a deep tone of voice, "Run
                     in," then the consul somewhere in the picture replied; "Keep that britchin
                     clear of the trucks, remember that." Fannie Creighton answered, in her silver
                     voice, "Fire." Mr. Creighton then appeared with a rammer, and said "By Jove,
                     men, let's shift off. You take it, Scotty, awhile." Old Jinks of the whaling
                     bark wanted to know "if them 'mokes' wasn't going to take their 'tower' at
                     these guns." Then Jeffers again appeared, and said, "That will do, boys, till
                     next time. Secure the piece, haul taut the side tackles and kile every thing
                     snug."</p>
                  <p>Then I felt, or dreamed that I felt, the shawl turned down from my face, where
                     it had been spread to keep off the distorting moon's rays, and Fannie
                     Creighton, in company with the mysterious companion of the merchant, stood by
                     my side, and looked steadily down at me. I was unable to move, though I
                     attempted to take her hand. Suddenly and hurriedly she bent down and <choice>
                        <sic>paessed</sic>
                        <corr>pressed</corr>
                     </choice> her warm lips upon my forehead. I struggled to cry out, and in fact
                     did so, and then Fannie Creighton vanished, and the dark, mysterious companion
                     hastily replaced the shawl, and departed into darkness. I struggled, awoke and
                     sat up. Two of the men came up to me from the waist.</p>
                  <p>"You was having a nightmare, sir. I he'erd you call out in a bitter manner and
                     I came over; 'peared like you was excited like."</p>
                  <p>"I never thought it was a good thing to sleep on deck in these latitudes at
                     all, even if you kivered yourself up," said the other to the first who had
                     spoken.</p>
                  <p>"Has any one been around here just now?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"No, sir; leastways I hain't seed none; did you, Bill?"</p>
                  <p>"No, there's been nobody around nearer to you than the man at the wheel, sir.
                     Have you seed anybody skivin around, Tom?" continued the man to the
                     helmsman,</p>
                  <p>"No, I wouldn't 'av' seed 'em though, there in the shadder of the sail, the
                     moon's got over the peak of the mainsail now.</p>
                  <p>"There were persons here, for I am almost certain that I saw them;" I said.</p>
                  <p>"Has you lost anything, sir?" asked the first who had spoken. 'It's a wery
                     vagram lot of chums that has come aboard last."</p>
                  <p>"No, I have lost nothing."</p>
                  <p>"You must ha' been dreamin'. sir, I think," and they walked away.</p>
                  <p>"Dreaming!" Yes, <emph>one</emph> part of the dream was clearly a dream, but I
                     was getting awake toward the last. I thought, as I stretched myself out, to try
                     and dream it again, if possible; while the men who had come to me were, with a
                     group around them, in the waist, going all over it again, and making sage and
                     ominous prognostications from the trifling incident.</p>
                  <p>I examined the covering that had been thrown over me.</p>
                  <p>It was a large India shawl. I did not wish to have any more investigations or I
                     should have inquired about it then, though I guessed that it was some of Macao
                     Joe's private property. As I was dropping to <unclear>sleep</unclear> again I
                     heard the voice of Jeffers call out:</p>
                  <p>"Joe, have those luggage boxes passed into the cabin."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIV.—THE BANGKONG.</head>
                  <p>I had been asleep an hour, when I recovered consciousness, amid some confusion
                     and tramping about the deck, and a jerk from Jeffers, who said as he jerked
                     me:</p>
                  <p>"Here's that infernal bangkong, right ahead."</p>
                  <p>I was up in an instant, and found the felucca in the tail of a small comet
                     apparently, for the light of her great lantern streamed out of the polished
                     reflector in one long <choice>
                        <sic>brilliaat</sic>
                        <corr>brilliant</corr>
                     </choice> train, making it almost day on our decks. It blazed out over the
                     water like the awful eye of an enraged sea griff, but it wasn't, for it was the
                     patrol boat that passed down by us a short time before. From the light of the
                     lantern we could see her long banks of oars sticking out horizontally like a
                     centipede, legs at rest. She lay a little out of our track, about one hundred
                     and fifty yards ahead, her triangular sail gathered loosely in the trail, over
                     the dusky shadow of a heavy crew.</p>
                  <p>Near the forward companion way on our own deck stood the three men most
                     interested, Creighton, Jeffers and Macao Joe. A perceptible palor overspread
                     the features of them all, but the face of Jeffers wore the most terrified
                     expression of the three. There was time enough to note that and wonder at <choice>
                        <sic>it it</sic>
                        <corr>it</corr>
                     </choice>, but<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6013-00000027" /> my eye glancing further
                     back rested with amazement upon the head and shoulders of two women standing in
                     the after companionway. It was Fannie Creighton and an Ayah. The luxuriant
                     tresses of the former were thrown back, as if interrupted in the performance of
                     her toilet, and her face exhibited a calm though interested expression that
                     was, oh! how beautiful. My eyes met hers, their "clear look out afar" ahead
                     vanished, and she bent her head away. The Ayah was jabbering all the while.</p>
                  <p>I turned to the danger now menacing.</p>
                  <p>"Let her come up a point! Aft sheets! Clear away that starboard gun and clap in
                     a stand of grape!" I shouted.</p>
                  <p>"No, no," said the merchant, "not by any means, if it can be avoided."</p>
                  <p>I did not intend to risk the bangkong alongside, full of men as it was, and
                     replied.</p>
                  <p>"Very well, sir; but I am almost certain that they will attempt to board, if we
                     dont come to."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then I shall not hinder you."</p>
                  <p>I was rather of the opinion that he would not either, for as I then felt I
                     would have blown forty bangkongs into kingdom come, one after another, before
                     anything should take us back to Putterrum. Never was any prospect more
                     appalling to contemplate than that of returning to that hole. Nevertheless I
                     felt buoyant as a cork, and cared no more for one bangkong, and the crew in it,
                     than I did for their king. We ranged up to it with a light three-knot breeze;
                     the men were called to stand by to repel boarders; cutlasses were brandished in
                     a trice, and pistols were plentiful.</p>
                  <p>Whence came these arms so suddenly? The men whom Jeffers and Macao Joe brought
                     off were professional marauders; men of whom there is to be said only that they
                     would take hard knocks and the chances of death for a little ready money. Such
                     fellows, of course, carry their arms with them even as a piper his pipes, or a
                     harper his harp, or an organ grinder his organ. Kreeses and cutlasses they then
                     had, but the pistols were in a chest, loaded and ready at a word. This same
                     chest I remembered to have looked into, and saw that it contained, on top,
                     spunyarn, mallets, marlin-spikes and was in appearance a "second mate's
                     ditty-box."</p>
                  <p>I heard one of the man-of-war's men, probably a "sea-lawyer," reflectingly
                     mutter over something about "being jestified in this 'ere business," but the
                     majority of the crew prepared with alacrity for the prospective brush with the
                     Rajah's bangkong, as a matter of course. "Gideon's Band" were particularly
                     elated with the opportunity of a regular romantic combat after the style of the
                     melodramas, or the yellow-covered sea-tales usually found on ship-board, caring
                     little enough for the consequences.</p>
                  <p>The felucca drew up within easy hail of the patrol boat, which was then on the
                     starboard bow. Some one on board of her opened the lantern door to adjust it,
                     seemingly, and the light for a moment fell upon the clump of officers in the
                     high stern, revealing their drawn swords and unusually gaudy dress.</p>
                  <p>Jeffers came up to me with a cutlass in his hand and a revolver in his belt,
                     looking calm and determined. I asked him if "his men" would fight.</p>
                  <p>"Of course they will," he answered. "Who of any of us wants to be taken
                     alive?"</p>
                  <p>"They know us on board the bangkong," I said.</p>
                  <p>"Oh yes, they know all about it now, for we've all been standing in the blaze
                     of her light."</p>
                  <p>"Is there any reply specially that you want me to make to his demand to 'come
                     to?'"</p>
                  <p>"No, you can say what you choose."</p>
                  <p>"Ahoy, dere," came over the water</p>
                  <p>I paid no attention to the hail, but motioned to the helmsman to raise his
                     wheel, with a view to running her down, so that they would be employed in
                     getting out of the way; and thus prevent their dashing along side to board.
                     This manœuvre was thoroughly successful, for by the time they had hailed again,
                     the fellucca's prow was pointed squarely for the boat, and as she came up to
                     the wind like a thistle-down, riding both air and water, they had much ado to
                     get out of her way. As it was, the sharp prow of our vessel broke a half dozen
                     or more of the sweeps, and gave the boat itself a grazing bump that made it
                     writhe like an old basket. With a confusion of curses and orders they scrambled
                     clear of the long gaunt sides of the vessel, and another hail was roared forth
                     above the confusion.</p>
                  <p>"Come to dere, or I kill all dam Ingleese.'</p>
                  <p>They began to work their sweeps with a will, and had it not been for the number
                     that was disabled, either by breaking the sweep itself, or the single pin in
                     the gunwale to which it worked with a strap, they would have shot alongside,
                     and might have got on board, some of them, after a short fight, for the
                     bangkong was heavily manned, and her people were used to that kind of business,
                     besides being no doubt stimulated both ways by hope of reward and by fear of
                     failure.</p>
                  <p>"Slack off dem sheets, or ebryting sall die," was now the order.</p>
                  <p>No answer had as yet been vouchsafed; this perfectly candid statement was
                     intended to have the effect of intimidating some portion or all of the crew
                     into letting the sheets go, which would thus lose the vessel her headway, and
                     enable them to get alongside before the trouble could be remedied. But they did
                     not know with what care the felucca's invoice of Asiatic stabbers had been
                     selected, by one thoroughly competent, from long experience in picking material
                     for transactions out of the usual line, to wit, Macao Joe. He had in this case
                     outdone himself, and exhausted his genius, for, from the general murderous
                     aspect of these gentry, the inference might have been drawn that they were the
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morceaus</foreign> carefully laid aside during a
                     long professional career, as something rare and valuable. They seemed to
                     understand the menace from the bangkong, and replied to it with a long drawn
                     "Cha-hah-ah-ah" expressive of contempt.</p>
                  <p>The patrol boat, however, kept on laboring at the oars, now assisted by the
                     sail, and seemed to hold its own on the felucca's quarter. The half naked crew
                     straining at the rumbling sweeps, which dashed up the pale flame-colored foam
                     in broad, sparkling paths on either side, chanted a wild and weird war song
                     that was common, no doubt, in bygone years, when the Rajah of Putterrum was in
                     the zenith of piratical conquest. It was rather a startling composition, and
                     would not have disgraced a chorus of fallen angels; in fact, it was a harmonic
                     cadence of yells and howls, and could be likened to nothing but the shrieks of
                     the damned, set to music.</p>
                  <p>"Ruther brash singin'," said one of the crew to another.</p>
                  <p>"I never expected to hear sich this side of the great breakin' up," returned
                     the other.</p>
                  <p>"I wonder if it helps 'em to pull any, hollerin' that way."</p>
                  <p>"They think it does, the poor benighted <foreign>balachang</foreign>
                     eaters."</p>
                  <p>I feared that the slightest abatement of the breeze would enable them<pb
                        n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6013-00000028" /> to get alongside, and therefore
                     commanded:</p>
                  <p>"Stand by, starboard gun's crew!" and noted the degree of routine we had
                     acquired in such short time.</p>
                  <p>The alacrity with which this order was obeyed showed that the bangkong's people
                     were getting rather near the abode of the spirits of their wooden gods. No
                     sooner was the matting thrown off from the "champagne bottles" than the bustle
                     on board the felucca drew upon it again the light of a lantern, which had been
                     sweeping around in other directions. The powerful illumination, from a
                     locomotive head-light, which it was, showed them a thirty-two-pounder gun,
                     looking at their boat with one man placing the percussion wafer and another
                     holding the lock lanyard ready. This was a picture on the white background of
                     the felucca's foresail which they little dreamed it was in the power of their
                     lantern to display—a revelation which cut short the war chant, and startled
                     them suddenly into one unanimous opinion which they immediately gave expression
                     to actions speaking louder than words. They lay upon their oars, and dropped
                     rapidly astern, giving utterance to a long drawn "Ah-hah-ah ha," that seemed
                     literally pushed out of them by consternation, and vanished, for their lantern
                     went out in a twinkling.</p>
                  <p>I looked for the one uppermost in my thoughts, as soon as the incidents just
                     related passed from the condition of things doing to that of things done, but
                     she too had vanished below. I joined in the conversation with Mr. Creighton and
                     Jeffers upon the escape, and was congratulated by the merchant for the
                     fertility of expedients evinced. I listened to these praises with a quickened
                     pulse and a generally comfortable frame of mind, the cause of which he little
                     dreamed.</p>

                  <p>Ere long a vivid blue train mounted high into the air from the direction of the
                     bangkong. It rose vertically to a great height and an intensely red glow
                     kindled and hung a moment in the air. The patrol boat was signalling with
                     rockets.</p>
                  <p>"Blue and red," said Jeffers, "whatever that means."</p>

                  <p>"We had better have rubbed out that bangkong, und done with it," I said.</p>
                  <p>"No, it is vastly better to have frightened her off without committing
                     ourselves to more than we have already. Once clear of these parts, there will
                     be nothing to apprehend that I have not devised a remedy for, more or less
                     sufficient."</p>
                  <p>"What do you think brought the patrol boat down here?" I asked; "a suspicion of
                     the purpose for which the 'Nautch Girl' was fitting for sea would have
                     occasioned, I judge, a different mode of procedure."</p>
                  <p>"It is not easy to conjecture precisely how far the suspicions of the Rajah
                     were awakened, if at all; for the utmost precautions certainly were taken to
                     arouse none. In this matter, however, which it is not expedient to explain
                     fully, the Rajah himself was compelled by circumstances to proceed with
                     caution; and would not, but for a certain determination that had taken
                     possession of him, to the exclusion of all rational arguments, have cared to
                     hinder my departure from Putterrum.</p>
                  <p>Rather, however, than I should take my child and property out of his territory,
                     he would proceed to extreme measures; though he is crafty enough not to take
                     any such steps until I shall be taken indisputably in the act of departing
                     clandestinely. Much was dependent on that and I am inclined to your opinion ion
                     that the simple arrest of this vessel I would not have been entrusted to a
                     bangkong sent down the coast for the purpose, if a suspicion of her errand out
                     of Putterrum had been entertained.</p>
                  <p>There is on the other hand, however, a bad look to the matter just now. From my
                     thorough acquaintance with eastern trickery and turpitude, and no place fuller
                     of it than Putterrum, I would not be at all surprised if the patrol-boat's
                     presence out here was but the first part of some shrewd attempt on the part of
                     the Rajah to kill two birds with the same stone. These orientals all of them
                     are proverbial for the beauty, if such things can properly be called beautiful,
                     of their plots, and the ingenious plausibility of projected, systematic
                     murders. The strange behavior of the patrol-boat, and the significant fact that
                     a single bangkong out of a number—the Rajah has thirty or thereabouts—was
                     despatched down here, instead of one or both of his steamers which latter would
                     be in every way more suitable and effective, convinces me that the Rajah is
                     fearfully in earnest in preventing my departure; though what the plan of his
                     operation is remains to be seen.</p>
                  <p>He walked up and down the deck nervously, while uttering these reflections and
                     at the conclusion stopped at the after companion-way and leaned over it in deep
                     thought. Calling Jeffers to him, after some moments the two entered into a low
                     earnest conversation, no part of which was audible.</p>
                  <p>Leaving them to discuss their own matters, I crossed over to the opposite side
                     of the deck, and amused myself by recurring to, the numerous and striking
                     events that had been crowded into the last few days. The men on board the
                     felucca were now on the alert, walking up and down in knots and couples forward
                     and in the waist, all in earnest conversation. The low confused hum of their
                     voices, on the otherwise stilly night, had a singularly impressive effect. It
                     was the like the hum in the third parallel just before the line moves out for
                     the assault.</p>
                  <p>What of Fannie Creighton now? The reader of this narrative has no doubt traced
                     the connection of different portions of it as the ambiguous phases are cleared
                     up by succeeding events. Still thus for her connection with the preceding
                     events and the causes which led to their recurrence was vague. The hints which
                     had been given by Jeffers during the first day of our acquaintance had not
                     afforded a very clear solution of the apparent mystery; and a better knowledge
                     of that person's salient qualities of mind and character, following duly with
                     increased intercourse, led me to <choice>
                        <sic>scrutenize</sic>
                        <corr>scrutinize</corr>
                     </choice> his acts, and to weigh well his station cats before accepting them as
                     worthy of their seeming interpretation. I was impressed with a belief that he
                     was a part of a mystery within a mystery, and one that was not shared by the
                     merchant. Whether Fannie Creighton was perfectly identified with this
                     undercurrent was not easy to determine, but that she was in some measure
                     connected with it was a conviction that I could not, from what had thus far
                     occurred, shake off.</p>
                  <p>While pondering these things Jeffers had resumed his walk, and after
                     interchanging a few words connected immediately with the vessel, he said:</p>
                  <p>"Did you notice the bangkong's crow were half naked and without turbans?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I noticed that; the crew looked more like Sakavan pirates than the coast
                     patrol."</p>
                  <p>"And the officers were dressed differently from the Rajah's naval
                        <unclear>officers."</unclear>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6013-00000029" />
                  <p>"Yes, I noticed that, in the few moments the lantern door was opened to adjust
                     the light'"</p>
                  <p>"Do you recollect the English brig's captain inquiring if any gunboats or a
                     frigate were in port?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"And what would you conclude from these things?"</p>
                  <p>"That the bangkong was a pirate?" I answered, inquiringly.</p>
                  <p>"Do you think the prahu or bangkong gentry would have forgotten to bring the
                     felucca to with a volley from their muskets and gingalls?"</p>
                  <p>"Of course not; I expected they would fire into us, and for that reason had the
                     starboard gun pointed, in readiness to blow them under the water if they did
                     so."</p>
                  <p>"This bangkong is not the same one that passed down the bay just before we came
                     on board. The light of this one was more brilliant, and she was more heavily
                     manned than that one. These two points are clear enough. Moreover, she was the
                     one that had probably surprised the English brig at her anchors, outside on
                     this bank, somewhere, and made her cut from them."</p>
                  <p>All that looked plausible enough, for I knew that vessels bound across the bank
                     often came to anchor in light, baffling winds, as a strong current was setting
                     to the northward along there. And years ago, and even now, during the season of
                     trade to Singapore, occasional instances of piracy were occurring, which had
                     only the effect of bringing a gunboat or two down, to fire away at random into
                     the jungle, or gladden with their presence, for a few days, the numerous
                     bamboo-hutted villages in the vicinity. The brig may have left or lost one
                     anchor elsewhere, and the other, for these vessels seldom have over two, was
                     probably lying on this bank, where she slipped her cable, to get out of the way
                     of some marauders, a few hours before. Stopping in at Putterrum to get another
                     and report the circumstance to the British consul, was manifestly the next
                     step.</p>
                  <p>"But," he continued, "pirates dont throw up rockets after failing to get on
                     board of a ship. It isn't an <choice>
                        <sic>occasson</sic>
                        <corr>occasion</corr>
                     </choice> with them for fireworks and rejoicing."</p>
                  <p>He paused, waiting to note the expression on my face, but whatever I thought I
                     said nothing.</p>
                  <p>"The conclusion that I have arrived at is this: The Rajah has sent out a
                     bangkong with a picked crew, disguised as pirates, trying to disguise
                     themselves as one of the coast patrol, by carrying a reflecting lantern. In
                     this character the bangkong that we frightened off has been down here making
                     feints and razzias. By way of establishing a reputation, then, they attempted
                     to plunder the brig. That was a feint, but the last attempt, to board us and
                     put every soul to death but Fannie Creighton, was anything but a feint. This
                     would have been a fine method of rubbing out at once all troublesome persons,
                     and, at the same time, gaining a claim on Fannie's good will by pretending to
                     ransom her—or rescue her with an expedition of bangkongs and a steamer to back
                     them. This very satisfactory consummation of his desires was to have been
                     accomplished by another atrocity, as the Singapore journals would say, with a
                     paragraph like this in the Singapore Times, after it was all over:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>"Despatches by the steamer Fou-Chou-Fou furnish us with the leading
                        particulars of another piratical razzia Putterrum bank, within thirty or
                        forty miles of that port. The yacht Nautch Girl, the property of Ex-Consul
                        Creighton, was boarded and captured by a large bangkong a few hours after
                        leaving Putterrum, bound for Singapore. Mr. Creighton and his family,
                        including his daughter, a young lady of seventeen, were on board on their
                        way to England, by way of Singapore. All on board the vessel but the
                        daughter are known a have been murdered, as the mutilated bodies were left
                        on the deck of the vessel piled together in a heap. The young lady is still
                        missing, and it is supposed that she was carried off by the miscreants, to
                        endure sufferings worse then death.</p>
                     <p>"The yacht was plundered of everything valuable, even to her stores. She had
                        on board (here his voice sank into a whisper) eleven thousand pounds in gold
                        belonging to the owner of the yacht, the proceeds of the sale of his real
                        estate at Putterrum. This of course has gone beyond recovery, but the vessel
                        was found slightly damaged by an attempt to set her on fire in Chambuk
                        river, whither the wretches had taken her. It has not yet been ascertained
                        from what point the pirates came, but a strange bangkong had been seen on
                        the coast a day or two previous to the capture of the Nautch Girl,
                        simulating the appearance of the Putterrum patrol boats, by carrying a large
                        reflecting lantern upon a <unclear>short</unclear> spar above the
                           <unclear>stern</unclear>, thus deceiving the vessels trading thereabout.
                        An attempt was made to board the brig Dusenbury Johnson the previous day,
                        but it was frustrated by being seen in time to slip the cable and stand out.
                        The pirates did not give chase for some reason unknown. The opinion of the
                        master of the brig was that they were all more or less drunk, and quarrelled
                        among themselves after their failure to surprise the Dusenbury Johnson, as
                        yells and pistol shots were plainly heard by all on board the latter
                        vessel."</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>He paused, after giving so much of a very plausible newspaper article; and I
                     supposed that, considering the occasion, he had been stimulating. There was,
                     however, no other proof of it than a desire to hear himself talk, evident from
                     the foregoing.</p>
                  <p>"You have the regular newspaper twang," said I; "did you ever correspond for
                     the press?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes. Would you like to hear the continuation of the account of our
                     death?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, proceed by all means. It is interesting in the absence of any thing
                     else."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, I'll bet that the article would wind up after this fashion."</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>From what has transpired in relation to this atrocity, it is conjectured and
                        generally believed, that these pirates came to this point in expectation of
                        the Nautch Girl, having no doubt obtained intelligence of her projected
                        trip, and possibly particulars relating to the passengers, money, &amp;c. A
                        significant circumstance in this connection obtains that the master engaged
                        to take her to Singapore was a total stranger to the port, and excepting a
                        letter of credit for a small amount upon the American Consular agent there,
                        was totally without credentials of any character. He, it is thought,
                        obtained the confidence of Mr. Creighton's agent, (who had sole charge of
                        getting the vessel ready for sea, procuring crew, officers, &amp;c.) and
                        this person, Mr. N. W. Jeffers, was the one through whom the berth was
                        obtained. Mr. Jeffers was well known in the port as a shrewd, energetic
                        managing man, but much given to intemperance and low associates. Knowing
                        these facts, the engagement of an unknown adventurer to fill a post of more
                        or less responsibility does not seem very difficult to account for. The
                        master was an American, or claimed to be such, and was on the Nautch Girl's
                        papers under an assumed name. He was, beyond doubt, either as<pb n="58-59"
                           xml:id="VAC6013-00000030" /> emissary or a guiding spirit in the bloody
                        enterprise, and came to Putterrum to ship on board the yacht in some
                        capacity, or to furnish more intelligence concerning her, when accident
                        placed him in command and control of many innocent lives, which were
                        deliberately decoyed into a frightful death. This miscreant was known to
                        have obtained men from a whaling bark calling in at Putterrum, and it is
                        thought, included them to run away. It is known that be furnished them means
                        while on shore, and engaged them as a part of the crew of the Nautch Girl,
                        under the pretext that he was to find <unclear>parties to</unclear> buy the
                        vessel on their arrival at Singapore."</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>"That is exceedingly good," I replied, as he paused again, "but is deficient,
                     of course, in the chief feature of interest, by the bangkong not being able to
                     board. It is a pity that such a good thing should be lost."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but the 'ides of March are not gone' yet."</p>
                  <p>"True enough; but do you suppose that they will try it again?"</p>
                  <p>"You will see before daylight," he said.</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, I must see very soon, for yonder is the sunrise shimmer on the
                     horizon."</p>
                  <p>"And yonder," he said pointing astern, "is the smoke of one of the Rajah's
                     steamers coming to the signal of the red and blue rocket. She has, no doubt,
                     followed us out, and kept at a convenient distance to allow part first of the
                     Putterrum drama to be enacted. This failing, she is signalled, and now comes to
                     overhaul, us in the regular way and bring us back by order of the Rajah. I knew
                     it would be so and have waited for daylight to see the smoke that I know is
                     there."</p>
                  <p>I looked astern and saw something that might be taken for smoke, but it was yet
                     too dark and misty to be able to speak decidedly about it.</p>
                  <p>The breeze had sprung up and the Nautch Girl was slipping along thro' the
                     water, noiselessly as yet, but not slowly by any means. I did not fear the
                     steamer, if the breeze held, for the Rajah's steamers, both of them, were very
                     clumsy boxes. One was converted from an old Hoogly river tow-boat, and, in her
                     day, was a suitable craft enough for dragging a tow up that swift river, but

                     pretty tender, causing the engineer to be very circumspect regarding the
                     pressure in them. She had English engineers, a class of men who are tutored by
                     the laws of England to entertain a professional horror of depressed crown
                     sheets, and to keep such an engineering <foreign xml:lang="FRA"

                     native built vessel,) with a pair of old Swedish trunk engines and a screw
                     placed in her. The engines were good yet. They had been taken out of a steamer
                     cast away on the Rajah's dominion somewhere, having been bought cheap from the
                     underwriters. This vessel was even slower than the first mentioned; but seven

                     got out of either of them in a sea way, while the arrow-like felucca could reel
                     off her ten knots easily, with the wind setting free into her great white
                     wings. The only danger lay in the breeze failing us. I had gathered these
                     particulars concerning the Putterrum cruisers during my leisure hours in the
                     port and felt assured that with a fair wind and no favors our chiefest dangers
                     were already over. In spite of everything indicating an increase of wind rather
                     than a calm, I felt uneasy and apprehensive.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it was something in Jeffers' face a sort of glint in his black eyes,
                     that seemed to say. "I know my power." He appeared to have no fears, from some
                     reason of his own, of capture no, but during the struggle of the bangkong to
                     get alongside, the muscles of his month twitched almost convulsively, and his
                     pale face grew as white and bloodless as flesh and blood can grow. It was<pb
                        n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6013-00000031" /> not from personal fear. There was a
                     reason beyond that. I studied him. From the first he appeared to be studying
                     me, and whenever he began a conversation with me I felt that he was only
                     "taking my measure."</p>

                     to his remark:</p>
                  <p>"Let them come; 'those who dance must pay the piper.'"</p>

                  <p>"All of us means Creighton &amp; Co. I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"Exactly. You are one of the innocents,' found occasionally in bad company, and
                     should such an improbable calamity occur as our being walked back to our old
                     friend, the Rajah, it will be my pleasing office to shield you from the
                     heaviest implication by confessing that you also were my dupe in this

                  <p>Also! He did not mean to let that word slip out. Who, then, were the others? I
                     cast about for them, without much result. It could not be the Rajah? Perhaps it
                     was; perhaps there was another phase that was yet to be illumined.</p>

                  <p>Every one knows that Tar is one of the most powerful modifiers of the mucous
                     membrane and this membrane lines the Stomach, Intestines, Throat, Lungs, R
                     adder, &amp;c. &amp;c. and it is its action upon this membrane which gives "Dr.
                     Crook's Wine of Tar" such great success, and gives it the prominent place it
                     now has in the world. "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" is a clear fluid, divested of
                     all foreign matter, rich in the medicinal properties of Tar, pleasant to the
                     taste, and endowed with efficacious properties. Try one bottle.</p>
                  <p>A farmer living in Zell Township, four miles west of Boonsboro, Iowa, named
                     Harrison McCloskey contracted a severe cold early in the Spring of 1868. He
                     could get to relief—grew worse, spit blood, had severe pain in his side and
                     breast, night sweats, loss of appetite, and could do so work of any kind. He
                     was completely cured by the use of Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar, and has gained
                     twenty-five pounds in weight, no cough, good appetite, and able to do any

                  <p>"I thank you for the intention," I answered. "Men are exceedingly apt to forget
                     such things; and besides, 'misery loves company,' you know. If you are
                     captured, it will then be idle for me to appear in the character of a
                     dupe."</p>
                  <p>"Why?"</p>
                  <p>"There will be a warm sprinkling of shot before a cruiser gets up to us, and I
                     shall order it."</p>
                  <p>"Humph! I see."</p>
                  <p>"And a hand-to-hand fight before they get on board," I continued; and I shall
                     be there also."</p>
                  <p>"You evince a keener interest in our escape than I expected. It seems to have
                     grown on you. You know you did not take very kindly to my proposition at
                     first."</p>
                  <p>"Explanations of such a change naturally suggest themselves" I said.</p>
                  <p>"Well, not to me. Say on."</p>
                  <p>I knew what he expected I would betray; but I "put him to sleep," to use his
                     own words.</p>
                  <p>"Gallantry, a beautiful and interesting young lady, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">et
                        cetera</foreign>, romance, sentiment."</p>
                  <p>I parried him with the object he sought to hit. He looked a little relieved, I
                     thought, and said:</p>
                  <p>"Never mind; you have good reasons. I suppose, for not wishing to tell. A
                     vessel like this is a prize worth fighting for."</p>
                  <p>Then smiling slightly, he asked:</p>
                  <p>"When did you discover Miss Fannie's disguise?"</p>
                  <p>"Not at all; she is a perfect actress. The deception was perfect."</p>
                  <p>"Have you seen her since she doffed it?"</p>
                  <p>"I saw her standing in the companion way when the bangkong was upon us. The
                     paint was removed and her hair down."</p>
                  <p>"What do you think of her?" This time he appeared lying in wait for my
                     reply.</p>
                  <p>"I think she is very fine looking. Why do you ask? It can't matter to you or
                     her either what I think."</p>
                  <p>"No, but she wished me not to tell you that she was on board."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! I was upon the point of asking you why you were so close about it."</p>
                  <p>"That was the reason. I thought that she intended making a conquest of you, and
                     was going about it in her own strange way."</p>
                  <p>"She is given to that sort of feminine sport, is she?"</p>
                  <p>"I should say, rather."</p>
                  <p>"Well, it's too late in the day, now," I said, truthfully, too, for the
                     conquest was already made. The answer pleased Jeffers, I thought, for he
                     laughed slightly and replied:</p>
                  <p>"Well, Fannie don't please some men."</p>
                  <p>"What would be her satisfaction in gathering in my affections, if I had any to
                     give?"</p>
                  <p>"To relieve the tedium of the cruise, I suppose, and furnish material<pb
                        n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6013-00000032" /> terial for her diary. I should like to
                     see that diary." He said these words in the most matter-of-fact tone
                     conceivable.</p>
                  <p>"There may be material-enough about daylight or an hour after; perhaps. Her
                     object in remaining disguised after getting safely on board, though—do you see
                     how that would help her to make a conquest? I think this a strange time to be
                     considering such things."</p>
                  <p>"I do not; and it was possible that such was not her object. She only said
                     'Don't mention to our captain or to any one else that he has any lady
                     passengers.'"</p>
                  <p>"Then it was merely prompted by motives of modesty, no doubt, it not being
                     convenient to assume her proper dress."</p>
                  <p>"But she added also, 'I want to bewilder him a little as soon as we get safely
                     out, he looks so invitingly stupid,'" replied Jeffers, quietly lighting a
                     cigar.</p>
                  <p>"You are betraying confidence, then," I said.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, I don't join her in every whim, she has too many," he replied. "If I did
                     it would be requisite to open an office for the business, and give full
                     attention to that and nothing else."</p>
                  <p>"You have known her some time. I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, intimately for years. I used to live at the bungalow, and fetch her to
                     and from Mauritius or Capetown." While he said this his voice was altered. It
                     was the tone of one recalling pleasant memories of things forever gone.</p>
                  <p>"She has a different look, somehow, from most English girls," I remarked.</p>
                  <p>"Probably her mother was a Corsican lady. She has all the Italian fire that is
                     requisite in any character," said Jeffers slowly, as if reflecting.</p>
                  <p>"And the object of leaving Putterrum in this secret, hazardous manner is to
                     save her from the necessity of marrying the Rajah?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, it is easily stated thus, 'Give me your daughter, or I'll throw you in
                     prison, take your property and have her anyhow."</p>
                  <p>"That was the Rajah's ultimatum, was it?" I said.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, twelve months ago. He then set spies to watch Creighton, who affected to
                     consent; but demanded time on his daughter's behalf. Fannie was sent for to
                     reside permanently in Putterrum; and then the business of getting away his
                     property from the East was cautiously commenced. To do this without being
                     suspected was fine manœvering, I assure you. I don't know how we should have
                     got along without Fannie. It was at last accomplished, however, and the bulk of
                     his fortune removed. The conversion of the real estate required shrewd
                     management and just the right buyers; but the withdrawal of his capital from
                     the local markets without discovery was a financial problem that considering
                     all things, was the most difficult of solution. Intrigue and Asiatic
                     double-dealing must be met and baffled; so we made Fannie into an <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">intrigante</foreign>, and, as your countrymen say, she was
                     our best holt.' Her intellect was greatly in advance of her years—or sex, for
                     that matter. She had great control over the Rajah, and managed many things that
                     would have been impossible without her. She discovered and baffled an attempt
                     set on foot to show up Creighton's movements, in a certain transaction, which
                     would have proved ruinous to the whole proceeding that were thus far
                     successful.</p>

                     Creighton's money, through Macao Joe. Any attempt to own a yacht at this time
                     would have been death to our hopes. Macao Joe was the best person that could be
                     obtained for the business of fitting out the felucca, and getting a crew at the
                     last moment. It was prudent, however, and necessary that we should have a hold
                     on him, lest at the eleventh hour he might want to trade. Fannie's wit was
                     equal to this also, and Macao Joe would not dare to turn traitor to the firm,
                     be his inclination and temptation ever so strong. Macao Joe knows how he has
                     laid himself open to capital punishment at the hands of the East India Company,
                     and Fannie knows also. The secret is safe with her, as long as Macao Joe is
                     faithful.</p>
                  <p>"Three weeks ago, some transactions with the Dutch Company in regard to the
                     sale of some securities by a certain person let in a little daylight into the
                     Rajah's lulled mind and there was imminent danger of utter ruin. The next night
                     an attempt was made to poison me with brandy, which caused me to look shy where
                     and when I drank. The person I refer to as the one who sought to be troublesome
                     was a cashiered subaltern from the Company's service; he is of Dutch and
                     English parentage, and was employed—after being dismissed from the Indian navy
                     at Colombo—in some of the offices at Batavia. He was dismissed <choice>

                     </choice> that again afterward for insolence to the Governor there. He is a
                     member of the Triad Society, speaks four or five languages well, and as many
                     more indifferently; has killed two men in duels; betrayed and ruined a young
                     governess at Singapore, and, with these qualifications, came down to take
                     service under the Rajah, in view of his threatened difficulties with the Dutch
                     Company.</p>
                  <p>To give himself a better introduction at Court, he makes use of some
                     information obtained stealthily from the secret office of the Dutch Company.
                     But Fannie was too quick for him, and created in the Rajah's mind an impression
                     that he was a spy of the Dutch Company, after which he could do no more damage,
                     though he had the whole transactions of Creighton with the Dutch company during
                     the past year in his hands, and proof with it. The Rajah's suspicions were
                     somewhat aroused nevertheless, and it was necessary to get away at once, as he
                     had named the day of Fannie's doom. Fannie ascertained that the Rajah was
                     endeavoring to settle up with the Dutch company the points of difference which
                     grew out of his countenance given to a piratical expedition, or the next thing
                     to it, which plundered several of their protectorate chiefs, and obtain the
                     company's sanction to placing a short embargo upon his ports. He gave specious
                     reasons enough for this measure; but the real one was to ascertain, as he could
                     by that means, if Creighton's capital was really invested in trade, as
                     heretofore, which he doubted. Other dangers threatened; and Creighton began to
                     worry. A master for the Nautch Girl was now wanted. He would have nothing,
                     though, but a new-comer, a young man who did not speak the language, to prevent
                     trading on our confidence, and a total stranger, to take the vessel out. 'An
                     English man preferred,' as the advertisements say; but you filled the bill near
                     enough. There were several good 'catches' before you came, but they were not
                     navigators. That, of course, was essential. A master obtained, little more was
                     to be done."</p>
                  <p>"What became of the person mentioned as endangering the prospect?" I asked;
                     "the cashiered naval officer?" for I knew him before I ever saw Putterrum.</p>
                  <p>"He is about there still, protected from assassination by the suspicion<pb
                        n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6013-00000033" /> of being an agent of the Dutch
                     Company, though it is rather a dangerous protection. He is lounging about the
                     adjacent ports, and returns frequently to Putterrum, sometimes richly dressed
                     and with plenty of money; at others dressed as a common sailor, or, again, as a
                     naval officer of some sort. He is seen in the lowest hells of Putterrum, and
                     has also the entree of the palace. He stayed for a while at the Sicundar Bagh,
                     but afterwards took a small oremgaso on the hill. He has monthly a stipendium
                     from some source, and gambles for the rest, or perhaps does worse.</p>
                  <p>"What sort of a looking person is he?" Jeffers had obtained but a portion of
                     his history.</p>
                  <p>"He looks in form and feature exactly like you," he replied.</p>
                  <p>"What is his name?" I thought of him when Miss Creighton explained her mistake
                     on the hill road bridge.</p>
                  <p>Jeffers laughed lightly and said: "It is getting light, do you see the smoke
                     now?" and then answered, "Van Horn is his real name. He has a dozen
                     besides."</p>
                  <p>There was only a blue haze discernible yet in the mist. The wind was still
                     blowing briskly, and there was nothing to be apprehended, for the present, at
                     any rate.</p>

                  <p>I could discern the headland looming up blue right in the vessel's track. It
                     looked like an ultramarine shadow, and was a long way off yet. When the vessel
                     got up to it there would be the point to take a departure, and leave the land
                     for deep water.</p>
                  <p>So, thought I, Julius Frazee, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alias</foreign> Trainor,
                     you have barely escaped giving me trouble again. Who would have expected to ran
                     upon you at Putterrum? Or have you, like Dick Swiveller, "closed up" other more
                     desirable placers? Then I thought that I, too, had "closed up" one small city
                     against further visits, but it was small loss.</p>
                  <p>"We are getting a little sea on now," said Jeffers.</p>
                  <p>"Yes; you're not going to get seasick, are you?',</p>
                  <p>"Not at all; I'm an old traveler on the water. Fannie and I have been many a
                     mile on the salt water. She's a very good sailor, and knows as much about 'port
                     and starboard' and those technicalities as many a swell yachtsman, at
                     least."</p>
                  <p>"Which is not saying much, however. The wind's hauling more abeam." "Aft sheets
                     everybody," I hailed to the groups in the waist. By the time the sails were
                     trimmed properly to suit the changed direction of the wind, the edge of the sun
                     was pushing above the horizon line, like a brazen shield just from the
                     polisher's hands.</p>
                  <p>Right astern, plainly now, could be seen the smoke and hull of a steamer. It
                     was well known to all on board by this time, and I heard various comments
                     expressive of doubt and misgiving as to the criminality of resisting her, if we
                     found the steamer overhauling us. This feeling was the result of "croaking" on
                     the part of one of the old man of war's men. These have as a class, from long
                     obedience to the authority of naval officers, a strong repugnance to firing
                     into anything that flies governmental bunting, unless under the orders of a
                     proper naval officer. There are, of course, numerous exceptions to the case,
                     not so much now as formerly, for many American men-of-war have crews composed
                     of all kinds of men and often a large percentage of a cruising frigate's
                     complement is first-rate material for fillibustering expeditions, and the like.
                     There were two old English <foreign xml:lang="FRA">matelots</foreign> among our
                     party, one of whom had previously, as before mentioned, expressed his doubts as
                     to the felucca's right to carry arms, or use them. He and another old seaman
                     now came to the quarter deck, and one, as spokeman, said:</p>
                  <p>"Cap'n, we dislikes to do anything that 'pears like a disrespect of dooty but
                     me and my chum wants to ax you if that steamer astarn is after us, and if so be
                     she is, and them guns is to be used, there is not a man in the ship as would
                     slat 'em around more willin'ly than me and my chum, if ther' was a chance to
                     git out 'en it arterward; but if things goes wrong, and we gets took, and
                     captured like, and there's a trial, an' a pow-wow, we of course would ax
                     protection of the English counsel. And the fust thing he'd ax us would be 'What
                     wus you doin' on that boat? Did you hear her commission read? Did you ship to
                     man guns?' and sich like questions as would be orkard fur to answer."</p>
                  <p>The old sea lawyer paused here, as if waiting for some remark from me that
                     would lead the way to more investigation.</p>
                  <p>"Well, what comes next?" I said, after a pause.</p>
                  <p>"Well, we hain't hyerd no cummission read in this ship, and nothin' was said
                     about guns when we shipped; and we don't see that she's appinted like a cruiser
                     no ways; and things don't look to us like as if we'd like to have any handlin'
                     of the guns, in case you intends to do it, and we tho't we'd jest speak of it
                     now, when everything is cool, so that when the time comes, there wouldn't be
                     any pow-wow like."</p>
                  <p>I saw in a moment that this feeling would gain ground rapidly if not uprooted
                     at once: Therefore I waited till they had finished and then answered:</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw, what do you mean by such insubordinate talk. You shipped to obey
                     orders, didn't you?—Well, that will stand between you and harm, any of you. I'm
                     captain of this vessel, and she carries an armament to protect her from pirates
                     and the like, and if a vessel chases us and I say that it is a pirate and fire
                     into her, that takes you all clear. That will do."</p>
                  <p>They walked away, taking a new view of it, and quite satisfied. I thought it
                     best to put the matter in its proper light before the American seamen, they
                     having no doubt become tinctured with doubts, which, at such a time are
                     catching, I knew precisely what to say to them. Having all hands called to the
                     waist, I came to the break of the low quarter-deck and delivered an harangue
                     something like the following:</p>
                  <p>"Men, when I shipped you, I did not expect to hear grumbling and jangling every
                     time a little smoke arose on the horizon. Let me hear no more talk about 'being
                     justified.' This vessel is to all intents and purposes mine, and you are the
                     crew proper. The rest are working their passage as stowaways, I am an American,
                     you are Americans, and therefore this vessel is an American vessel, and as such
                     we are bound to see her out, and if we do, it won't set you back any, be
                     assured. Now, if the wind should fail, and that Putterrum Pirate should
                     overhaul us, I want to know right now if you are going to let those fellows
                     wave <choice>

                     </choice> free born Americans? The bloody skull-and-cross-bones a wa-a-a a-ving
                     over the gorgeous banner, Liberty? What one of you could hold up his head like
                     a man, and walk into a saloon in New York or New Orleans, or anywhere, after
                     such a story got back there? How would you feel if you heard some one say,
                     'There's one of them bummers that let the stars and stripes be trampled on by a
                     parcel of barbarian<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6013-00000034" /> barian niggers.'
                     Hear 'em say, 'Them men had plenty of arms and ammunition, two good guns and a
                     'bully boy with the auburn hair,' that wasn't afraid of blue blazes, to lead
                     'em, but they would'nt fight, because they was afraid they would not be
                     'justified.' Your liquor would not do you any good; it would'nt even 'scratch.'
                     It would taste like gall and wormwood.</p>
                  <p>There was a loud, tumultuous cheer, ending with a tiger, cutting short any more
                     "spread-eagle talk," and that was the last of any qualms on the subject of
                     firing into the Rajah's cruisers. I stepped back, feeling a little sheepish at
                     my salt water oratory, and not a little astonished at the boisterous
                     acclamations. I had expected that there would be some parley, questions and
                     explanations necessary before they settled down into a willingness to resist,
                     and was therefore taken by surprise at their ready shouts.</p>
                  <p>I was not long at a loss for the key to it, for aft on the weather side of the
                     quarter deck stood a very radiant incarnation of all that is lovely. Miss
                     Creighton had come up, unperceived by me as I faced the men, and passed quietly
                     to a good position to hear the orator. That was the key of the enthusiasm. Her
                     father was just appearing as I concluded, and said with some slight surprise,
                     though in a placid tone:</p>
                  <p>"It looks as though we were having a sort of hustings on board."</p>
                  <p>In a few words I explained the difficulty, and then showed him that the steamer
                     had commenced to draw up to us quite rapidly. The breeze was lighter now, and
                     everything looked favorable for a running fight. Jeffers came up from the
                     forward cabin where he had been napping a little on the sofa, and said, after
                     looking at the steamer:</p>
                  <p>"Come on Mr. Kingsley, here we are."</p>
                  <p>It was the side-wheeler that was astern, and no other sail or smoke was in
                     sight in any direction. She was after us no doubt, with a reward to stimulate
                     all on board.</p>
                  <p>"What were you saying just now in that queer style," asked Jeffers; "what was
                     the object of it?"</p>
                  <p>"That's the custom in the States when occasion arises for making the fur fly,"
                     I replied.</p>
                  <p>"Wouldn't your men come to time without all that sort of 'Hail Columbia?'"</p>
                  <p>"Properly authorized, they would; but as this vessel is just now, in the eyes
                     of maritime law, a pirate, and nothing less, it required a little explanation
                     on my part to get up the proper degree of enthusiasm, and to drown out, so to
                     speak, the bad look that matters were assuming in their eyes."</p>
                  <p>"My men don't require any thing of the sort."</p>
                  <p>"No, I judge not," I returned dryly; "but will they stand fire?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"I doubt it somewhat."</p>
                  <p>"Why not, as well as yours? They have all of them smelled gunpowder enough in
                     their time, I'll warrant," he returned.</p>
                  <p>"They look hard enough to have stood almost anything; but, ten to one, midnight
                     surprises and fireworks is their style of fighting."</p>
                  <p>He colored a very little through his white skin, and said quickly:</p>
                  <p>"I'll bet they stand the racket cooler and better than your green hands
                     there."</p>
                  <p>"And I'll bet you twenty rupees that they scatter about the decks like ducks in
                     a hailstorm, at every shell."</p>
                  <p>"Done," he said, and raised the glass for a view at the vessel.</p>
                  <p>Wondering at his extreme <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nonchalance</foreign>, with
                     the prospect of capture and something worse before him, I turned away to attend
                     to the vessel, far from feeling so very tranquil, I am willing to confess. The
                     loss of the Nautch Girl, and the chance of being killed or crippled by the
                     cruiser's shot or shell, did not occupy my attention. The vision of a loathsome
                     prison, consuls' letters, procrastination, delay, and perhaps death, passed in
                     review before the mind's eye, without exciting other than a dogged
                     stubbornness. But the contemplation of the probability of being cut off from
                     hoping; and still more the imminent fate of one who had in a few short days
                     beamed upon my miserable life, brightening it with hope of real happiness,
                     factitious and unwarranted, but still hope, created a feeling in my breast that
                     may have worn the outward semblance of fear.</p>
                  <p>The merchant glanced at me with a certain expression, which I interpreted
                     correctly. Jeffers said in a low tone to Miss Creighton, which, though not
                     intended for my hearing, seemed to crash through my brain like the tones of a
                     Chinese gong, "Our captain is beginning to show the white feather, Fannie."</p>
                  <p>I was upon the point of springing toward him, and choking out a retraction of
                     the words, when she replied, with a flushing cheek and kindling eye:</p>
                  <p>"Hush, he will hear you; and then you may have cause to change your opinion,
                     I'm not often mistaken, and his emotion is not that of personal fear, I know.
                     Do avoid any cause for a disturbance now."</p>
                  <p>My attention was called to the waist of the vessel by loud words in many
                     languages, and some shoving and crowding among the men. This was no occasion
                     for intestinal brawls. Not waiting to inquire into the merit of the disturbance
                     I fired three shots from my revolver, in quick succession, over the
                     belligerents, thus securing their attention; and directed Macao Joe to inform
                     his friends—for the quarrel was among the native crew exclusively—that my next
                     bullet would find its way <emph>into</emph> their midst instead of over head,
                     if there were any more of such proceedings. This was done by that individual
                     with some polyglot swearing and much gesticulation. The knives were put up,
                     with the usual muttering, and an occasional sharp word at each other, after the
                     manner of fish women. The presentiment of evil, out of mind for a short time,
                     returned to me again. By this time there was but little breeze, and the chance
                     of a running fight even died away with the wind. Nearer drew the steamer, her
                     hull showing plainly now, and in the glass the white water at her bows was
                     easily distinguishable.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVIII—IMPROVING THE HOUR</head>
                  <p>"Here comes the breeze again," said I, as a blur was apparent to an experienced
                     eye on the water. "Let the men get breakfast, there's another lease of hope."
                     The sails distended, and the felucca acknowledged the impulse, gliding off like
                     a thistle down, or a dead leaf on the bosom of a rapid. The aroma of coffee
                     mingled with a positive odor of onions, floated on the balmy morning air of the
                     tropics, as the cook handed out from his galley the morning meal. The steward
                     was slicing off steaks from a huge hind-quarter of beef that swung from the
                     back of the galley, for the cabin meal, while the cabin boy, a young gentleman
                     whom I had never the honor of laying eyes on before that moment; brought a tray
                     of coffee and sugar cakes, and passed them.</p>
                  <p>"Where did you spring from?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">No intiende, senor captain</foreign>," he
                     answered.</p>
                  <p>"He came with our crowd," said, Jeffers, I forgot to send one aboard before.
                     This <foreign xml:lang="SPA">muchacho</foreign> I found wandering<pb n="68-69"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000035" /> dering about Putterrum, with no money, no
                     friends, nowhere to go, and nothing to do when he get there. He belongs to
                     Manilla, he says.</p>
                  <p>"How did he get adrift in Putterrum?"</p>
                  <p>"Same old story; ran away from a vessel, a whaling brig, and ran away from home
                     to get on her. Now, having seen enough of the world, he is making his way back
                     to his mother, who no doubt wishes that he would remain abroad
                     permanently."</p>
                  <p>"Why, Mr. Jeffers, how can you speak so?" said Miss Creighton, a sort of
                     tender, motherly expression stealing over her face, as she regarded the weary
                     and worn-looking young wanderer. "His mother, if living, is yearning for his
                     return, no matter who she is, or what kind of a boy he was. Though I suspect he
                     has been something of 'a trial,' as the old ladies say," she continued,
                     regarding the hunger-thinned, but handsome, manly face of the lad.</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw! I know Manilla people of his class well enough. They rejoice when a
                     brat falls into the river; there's one less to feed. But they don't fall in
                     often; if they do they manage to get out again," he returned. I was thinking of
                     my early drifting about, and watching the strange loveliness of Miss
                     Creighton's face. It was a perfect blending of the Madonna and Lady Gay Spanker
                     types, and sometimes one or the other predominated. Now there was a tenderness,
                     a sort of yearning expression in her eyes and features, that showed her to be a
                     true woman in soul, and that she emerged from the almost wanton life at the
                     Putterrum court as uncorrupted as a young angel.</p>
                  <p>"I shall make a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protege</foreign> of that poor lad, and
                     see that he gets home again," said Miss Creighton, as the cabin boy went below
                     with the things.</p>
                  <p>"You had better get out of the hands of the Phillistines yourself, Fannie,
                     before you look after others," answered her father from the other side of the
                     deck.</p>
                  <p>I had kept aloof from her thus far from a regard for her own feelings, together
                     with a certain embarrassment that I felt in addressing her, after our second
                     extraordinary interview; but after her father and Jeffers had gone below, to
                     take a glass of brandy, probably, and confer together, she came to me, and
                     extending her hand in a frank, girlish way, said:</p>
                  <p>"It is rather late to say 'how do you do,' after being on deck so long, but you
                     would not even give me a nod of recognition, so I shall make your acquaintance
                     myself, as I did on the hill road."</p>
                  <p>"I waited till you might be pleased to renew our singular acquaintance, and at
                     last am rewarded for my patience."</p>
                  <p>After a short conversation she asked, with some slight embarrassment: "What do
                     you think of me, after last night?"</p>
                  <p>"It can't be of consequence to you what a stranger like me thinks."</p>
                  <p>"But it is of consequence. What could I have been thinking about! I felt so
                     sorry afterward for the deception I had practised upon you."</p>
                  <p>"And for drawing me out completely, I suppose," I answered.</p>
                  <p>"I could not resist continuing the deception, you were so perfectly astray. My
                     intention at first was only to try my disguise upon you, and then to leave you,
                     still unsuspecting, till I could appear after changing the dress for my proper
                     one; but the luggage boxes were not readily got at in the hold, for they were
                     sent aboard as merchandise, and, by mistake, put away as such. The conversation
                     took such a strange turn, that I thought to see what you thought of me, for you
                     could not help but think something."</p>
                  <p>That is very likely. I thought a great deal that I am rejoiced to find was only
                     an idle, unwarranted fear; and if anything that I spoke last night was
                     unpleasant, you will know how to excuse it. How did you disguise your voice so
                     perfectly? It seems that one ought never to forget it after once hearing it. It
                     recalled you to me but still was disguised a great deal."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, that was not difficult, for I had practised such things for amusements
                     when a child. How completely bewildered you were."</p>
                  <p>"Recollect that it was dark. No shade of brown paint could hide your features
                     from my scrutiny in daylight," I replied.</p>
                  <p>"But my expression was hidden too, or much altered. It was bold, perhaps, to
                     take such a costume, but the circumstances required it. I could not have got
                     through the town without being recognized. Ladies, you know, never come down
                     into it at night, and to go with papa I must have male attire. It was managed
                     very cleverly; for since a certain person tried to ruin papa by exciting the
                     Rajah against him, the town has been full of spies who noted every movement of
                     ours; but none recognised me. To leave the bungalo at night would have drawn
                     upon me a watcher, so I went in the afternoon to ride, and did not return as
                     usual. I had stopped in the meantime at the house of my ayah's mother, and
                     there put on the disguise that had been sent thither previously. This house was
                     three miles from the <choice>
                        <sic>supurbs</sic>
                        <corr>suburbs</corr>
                     </choice> and remote from any other. I then came back home on foot, met papa at
                     his usual place on the Verandah, and told him that his daughter's horse had
                     lamed itself very badly, and that she was waiting for another to be sent to a
                     certain house, naming it, and the servants all knew that it was where my ayah
                     lived.</p>
                  <p>So nothing was suspected when papa said, 'Jupenna you can ride out there and
                     remain with your mother till to-morrow. The household is tired, so I will go
                     myself for the ride.' The men servants had been purposely employed the whole
                     day to make that plausible, otherwise it would have been wondered that he did
                     not send a groom with a led horse; and anything that was out of the usual way
                     would be forthwith reported, we knew. Papa left casually, telling the pipe-boy
                     to have his favorite hookah tube carried out and mended against his return.
                     When out of the vicinity of the hill residences the horses were hid in a
                     thicket, and we crossed down toward the town and passed through it.</p>
                  <p>My woman had, while in her apartment, disguised her face, and took with her the
                     male attire which she put on in the thicket. On the way down we met the other
                     servant by pre-arrangement, and papa pretendingly scolded him and sent him on
                     an errand to the lower end of the town, where he joined us again unobserved.
                     These were the only servants that we dared to trust with the secret of our
                     flight, and these not till the last few days."</p>
                  <p>"The men who came with the boat, how were they provided?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"Macao Joe sent them to a point to wait for him. They are his boat's crew, and
                     it was his boat. On our arrival there papa told them that Macao Joe was on
                     board of a vessel out in a bay waiting for him. That excited no suspicion with
                     them.—The servant then took two of them and fetched a box from close by, where
                     it had been hidden, and we shook off the dust from Putterrum.</p>
                  <p>"Why did you not go to the house of some friend and put on the disguise?" I
                     asked.</p>
                  <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6013-00000036" />
                  <p>"No one who has to remain in Putterrum would desire to have the Rajah's
                     displeasure; it is a serious matter. Besides the espionage of their servants
                     would be as bad.—Neither did I wish to subject any friend of ours to the danger
                     of the Rajah's rage, when he discovered our escape. His vindictive spirit would
                     lead him to injure all who assisted in it. So here are all who were concerned;
                     ready for disposal, if that steamer can get up with us,"</p>
                  <p>"Some of us will be safe beyond the reach of his vengeance before they capture
                     you," I answered with some warmth.</p>
                  <p>"It would be useless to fight the steamer's crew. It would be throwing your
                     life away, and your mens. You and they can escape by the protection of your
                     consul, perhaps, at least from open danger."</p>
                  <p>"I can speak for them and myself, that you shall not be given up without a
                     fight, hand to hand; and if the native crew that Jeffers brought with him on
                     board will fight at all, we can hope to beat off the steamer's men. Her crew is
                     not much larger than ours."</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid it will be throwing your life away," she said, quietly.</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, I'll throw it away. It will not be worth much after you—that is,
                     after what I have already done to involve me in the fate of the rest."</p>
                  <p>She looked at me with a sad expression, and said: "No; papa has left a letter
                     to be handed to the commander, who is an Englishman, and who is indebted to
                     papa for his position in the Rajah's service, besides other important
                     assistance. The letter provides for a supply of means if he loses his position
                     under the Rajah, by failing to capture us. If that does not answer the purpose
                     there is no likelihood that shedding blood will succeed."</p>
                  <p>"Well, we'll have a 'battle royal' with Kingsley's riffraff before we give up.
                     I have great faith in hard knocks, in a case of this kind. If I had as many
                     more lads on board like those forward, yonder, I should not value the steamer a
                     rush, officers and crew, engineers and firemen, and the whole aggregated lot."
                     I replied.</p>
                  <p>"What class of men are those, they do not look quite like sailors?" she asked,
                     looking in the direction of Gideon's band, who were seated apart by themselves,
                     putting away a large quantity of Mr. Creighton's provisions, with much
                     indifference to a prospective "scrimmage" with the Rajah's gunboat,
                     apparently.</p>
                  <p>They are a part of the brood of the American Eagle, genuine specimens of
                     republican 'sovreigns,' and are a part of what the American constitution rests
                     upon. Rough, uncultivated freemen, they drink whiskey, fight, play poker, and
                     have besides a great many other sins of omission and commission. They probably

                  <p>There was a pause, and she went to the companion way and looked down.</p>
                  <p>"You spoke of a person who attempted to frustrate Mr. Creighton's plans for

                  <p>"I used to think him very ill-looking, she said, but I suppose that I must
                     ascribe that to prejudice, and think now that he must have been handsome," she
                     replied, looking at<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6013-00000037" /> me with the
                     fairest twinkle in her blue eyes, little thinking that I knew whom the man
                     resembled.</p>
                  <p>"What was his name?"</p>
                  <p>She paused again, and then replied:</p>
                  <p>"Van Horn was one of his names. I think he was in the habit of changing it as
                     occasion required."</p>
                  <p>"That brings me to think of a question that I wanted to ask," said I. "Who was
                     the person for whom you mistook me, on the hill road, when you switched me in
                     the face with the festoon?"</p>
                  <p>"What did you think when I committed that rudeness?"</p>

                  <p>"I presume so; but what his name?"</p>
                  <p>"He called himself Trainor," she replied, with a slight blush.</p>
                  <p>"That was one of his names; but wasn't he in the habit of changing it as
                     occasion required?"</p>
                  <p>"Jeffers has been telling you," blushing still more.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, Jeffers and you together; and now I'll tell you what I thought on
                     that occasion."</p>
                  <p>"I don't think I want to know now," she answered hesitatingly: "you have acted

                  <head>Why Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar cures so many diseases.</head>
                  <p>Every one knows that Tar is one of the most powerful modifiers of the mucous
                     membrane, and this membrane lines the Stomach, Intestines, Throat, Lungs,
                     Bladder, &amp;c. &amp;c. and it is its action upon this membrane which gives
                     "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" such great success, and gives it the prominent place
                     it now has in the world. "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" is a clear fluid, divested
                     of all foreign matter, rich in the medicinal properties of Tar, pleasant to the
                     taste, and endowed with efficacious properties. Try one bottle.</p>
                  <p>A farmer living in Zell Township, four miles west of Boonsboro, Iowa, named
                     Harrison McCloskey, contracted a severe cold early in the Spring of 1868. He
                     could get no relief—grew worse, spit blood, had severe pain in his side and
                     breast, night sweats, loss of appetite, and could do no work of any kind. He
                     was completely cured by the use of Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar, and has gained
                     twenty-five pounds in weight, no cough, good appetite, and able to do any
                     work.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman in West Cornwall, Conn. named Hamilton B. Howard, writes that he
                     has used Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar for Bronchitis, and <emph>it has entirely
                        cured him</emph>, although his family physician pronounced his case beyond
                     cure. A friend who knew the merit of Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar, prevailed on him
                     to try it, and he sends permission to publish his statement.</p>

                  <p>"Hatefully, I suppose; that's often a lady's word to express a great deal or
                     nothing," I replied, filling out the hiatus.</p>
                  <p>"Not, perhaps, so bad as that; but you know what you think, and you may be
                     mistaken."</p>
                  <p>"Jeffers told me something more. Perhaps he considered it confidential, or that
                     I would not be sufficiently intimate with you to speak of it again. At all
                     events, as you both are well acquainted, I will do it. Such a small matter
                     cannot impair the friendly relations of years."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Jeffers has always been very much attached to me ever since I knew him,"
                     she replied, with childish ingenuousness; "but he is not very discreet in some
                     things, however deep his character may be for others. You may tell me without
                     fear of creating ill-feeling between us, though I have a foreboding of what it
                     is."</p>
                  <p>"He said that you wanted to bewilder me, because I looked so invitingly
                     stupid."</p>
                  <p>The lovely carnation flush overspread her slightly dimpled cheeks, as she
                     replied, a little embarrassed:</p>
                  <p>"Is that all? I feared that with his usual penetration he had suspected my
                     dearest secret; and I suppose that you felt vexed and uneasy, until you had
                     confronted me with it."</p>
                  <p>"I had hoped that it was a mistake of his, or that you could put a different
                     look upon it, by explanation."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps it is true. <emph>Are</emph> you not a little stupid?" she asked, in a
                     smiling, tantalizing way.</p>
                  <p>"I don't think so," I replied.</p>
                  <p>"Well, now, I think you are a little stupid not to understand a woman any
                     better than that." And with a light laugh she descended to the cabin, saying as
                     she went down the companion steps, with a certain winning, witching of manner,
                     that was death to one's peace of mind: "I must not converse too long with you,
                     it might look as if I wanted to 'bewilder you.' If that steamer does not catch
                     us, I have something to tell you."</p>
                  <p>"And if that steamer does catch us I have something to tell you," I said, more
                     to myself than her. For if the dread hour should draw nigh, when the dismasted
                     and sinking felucca, waited on the waters for the coming vessel that was to
                     take her back to the Rajah's mercy, I felt that if I lived I should speak out
                     like a man the all-pervading love that otherwise would have to be locked up in
                     my own breast, perhaps for ever. But it would then be a relief to tell her
                     all.</p>
                  <p>She stopped, and looking back, it seemed with a more saddened expression, as
                     she asked:</p>
                  <p>"Was that intended for me?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, if you heard it," I answered.</p>

                  <p>"I already know it," she replied, and disappeared.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIX—A RUNNING FIGHT.</head>
                  <p>"I think we're leavin' the steamer now, sir," said Kittler, handing me the
                     glass, "if we were only clear of that headland yonder, we'd have a spankin'
                     breeze and could run that smoke house hull down astern, directly.</p>
                  <p>I looked. She had evidently not gained on us, at least, but was, from the
                     quantity of smoke issuing from her funnel, doing her best towards it.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the steward announced breakfast. Contrary to all the precedents of
                     orthodox lovers, and in defiance of my somewhat romantic situation, I went down
                     and did ample justice to the meal, which fully justified all that Jeffers had
                     spoken of the steward's ability. I had thought that perhaps I would have been
                     honored with a place at the merchant's table in the after-cabin; but Jeffers
                     himself sat down with us in the cuddy. The meal was devoured in the sullen
                     silence peculiar to <unclear>mariners</unclear>, interrupted occasionally, by a
                     brief remark upon our chances of getting clear of the steamer, or a demand for
                     something from the steward. The deck had been left in charge of one of the old
                     sailors whom I had appointed to the brevet dignity of third mate and boatswain,
                     which entitled him to take the deck when occasion required it. His name was
                     Speed.</p>
                  <p>At intervals during the meal we could hear the clear silvery tones of Miss
                     Creighton's voice speaking in Spanish to the cabin-boy who was serving them;
                     and I thought how happily would a life glide away to the daily melody of such a
                     voice for a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tete-a-tete</foreign> at meal times. These
                     musings would be jarred away anon as Kitler would growl out, "Steward, more
                     taters," or Macao Joe, desisting from his activity, expressed gutterally, in
                     his broken style, an opinion on the weather. The meal was nearly concluded when
                     a loud flap of the mainsail told us how suddenly and utterly the breeze had
                     failed again. We all went on deck.</p>
                  <p>There was no trace of a flaw from the windward, or what had been the windward.
                     It was almost a dead calm. All came up. The sun shone brightly on the greenish
                     waters that heaved sluggishly with the constant ground-swell on Putterrum bank.
                     Ahead, now clearly defined, rugged and patched with green foliage and sporadic
                     cultivation, arose Putterrum Head. It was but a few miles distant, and two
                     hours more of the breeze would have opened the broad ocean sweep to fill our
                     canvas and waft us away—away beyond the reach of the Rajah's cruiser, or the
                     Rajah's rapacity and wrath.—But it was not to be.</p>
                  <p>The felucca had barely steerageway now, and anxiety was apparent upon the stern
                     features of the merchant. It seemed as if the dream which had sustained him
                     through many years of toil and hazard, and which was now all but realized; was
                     dissipated with the ominous shake of the felucca's broad wings. What emotions
                     were teeming then in his despairing breast, as he gazed at the pale face of his
                     child, were difficult for one not so placed to conceive.—She gazed at the
                     approaching cruiser with a calm, steadfast expression of resignation.
                     Underlying it, however, could be detected the repressed agony of mind at the
                     contemplation of her own miserable future, and her father's heart-breaking
                     grief that would ensue.</p>
                  <p>The men moved restlessly about the decks, making little personal preparation
                     for a change that foreboded evil.</p>
                  <p>"Come, Scotty, pay me that three rupees now while I think of it. A man wants
                     all his little money in his garments when things is goin' to cave in," said
                     one.</p>
                  <p>"What cheek you have about the money; didn't I say I'd pay at Singapore, and
                     the money is mine till we get to Singapore? Besides, I ha'nt got it; I spent it
                     for drinks and some terbacker; and you helped drink the liquor."</p>
                  <p>Jeffers looked a little nervous now. He and Macao Joe conferred hurriedly
                     together. The native crew were the least concerned, and stood gazing stolidly
                     astern, uttering a few remarks among themselves.—There was no chance now for
                     Kingsley, the English commander of the cruiser; to accede to the offer of the
                     letter alluded to by Miss Creighton. There was no loophole to escape through,
                     or mitigating circumstances to excuse or palliate his failure to capture the
                     felucca now. Nothing short of an explosion of the steamer's boilers, or
                     breaking down of her engines, would save him from the Rajah's "naked wrath."
                     Aside from this, it was not certain that he would choose to take any risk
                     whatever, as there was, no doubt, a reward for the capture of the felucca, that
                     would be sufficiently remunerative.</p>
                  <p>"Hear the drumming of her paddles!" said Speed.</p>
                  <p>The red paddles of the coming vessel flashed in the sunlight, and their low
                     muffled dash was faintly audible.</p>
                  <p>"Here comes a puff," said Kitler, and the sails filled out once more. But it
                     was almost too late now, the cruiser was within distant range of her guns, and
                     would no doubt fire upon us as soon as it was noted that we were drawing ahead
                     again.</p>
                  <p>"That opens the ball," exclaimed Jeffers, as a white cloud swelled out lightly
                     from her bows, and rolled along the surface. A few seconds of silence
                     intervened ere the report boomed over the water upon our ears; then there came
                     a hoarse, wicked scream, as the shot passed away to starboard, plunging with a
                     dull bang, and a white feather of spray darting up, to mark its resting
                     place.</p>
                  <p>"Stand by, both guns' crews," I shouted.</p>
                  <p>The men stepped out to their places with the air of veterans, like men to whom
                     the business of fighting against recognized powers was a matter of course. The
                     men in charge of each piece gave the order, "Load away, boys," and soon all was
                     ready. I stepped to the merchant:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Creighton," I said, "I'm sailing this vessel under your orders in
                     everything but resistance to yonder steamer. I will give you a chance to
                     provide a defence in case we are taken, before the tribunal of your own nation.
                     You can have witnesses to testify that you ordered me not to fire into the
                     steamer, and that I set your orders at defiance."</p>
                  <p>That I thought might avail him somewhat if we were taken.</p>
                  <p>"Young man," he replied, "I would be glad not to be utterly cut off from such
                     aid as money will obtain in this business. It is a feeble hope, for there are
                     some difficulties in the way of direct application to English protection, or I
                     should not have been hindered from leaving Putterrum at any time by the Rajah.
                     These measures he has been loth to adopt, as he himself would become more or
                     less involved; but I would be cut off from all hope, if the flag of Putterrum
                     was fired on by my direction. Are you aware of the position you become placed
                     in by such a course?"</p>
                  <p>"Perfectly."</p>
                  <p>He called the steward.</p>
                  <p>"I tell you not to fire into yonder vessel; mark that, steward."</p>
                  <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6013-00000039" />
                  <p>"Yes, sir," said the man, understanding it, as it seemed.</p>
                  <p>"I shall not obey your orders, for I want this felucca, and if an active
                     skirmish with round shot will save her, I shall try to beat the steamer
                     off."</p>
                  <p>"Very good, I wash my hands of it."</p>
                  <p>"There she comes agin," shouted some one as the smoke rolled out from the
                     steamer; and, as before, the shot flew wide, and went wandering away off the
                     quarter, little jets of spray rising closer to each other, as the spent ball
                     ricocheted over the green surface. There was a murmur among the native crew;
                     slight, but I noted it.</p>
                  <p>"He is loth to hit us," said Creighton; "but as the breeze has increased
                     considerably, he will come nearer next time. There is a hope yet if the wind
                     will stay with us."</p>
                  <p>"His ball practice is rather poor," said Jeffers, with a show of his usual easy
                     manner.</p>
                  <p>"Look out! two! hull! three!" exclaimed several together, as the steamer, from
                     the successive discharge of three guns, was now surrounded with smoke, and her
                     three shot tore the air. Another succeeded after a short interval. Suddenly a
                     white cloudlet in the air was followed by a report, and the hissing of shell
                     splinters above and about us.</p>
                  <p>The wind was still taking us blithely along Putterrum head drew nearer. Beyond
                     that was safety. The next shot might cripple the felucca's spars, or a splinter
                     from a shell might take <emph>her</emph> life. It was closing the gate to all
                     hope for me if we were taken. With no gold to keep afar a loathsome dungeon, a
                     lingering death in a tropical prison, I was taking a heavier risk than that in
                     common with all on board; but I did not give it a thought then. I was only
                     waiting to see if the commander was not making a mere show for his own benefit.
                     A disclosure of our armament would be likely to increase the onerousness of his
                     failure by laying him open to the accusation of cowardice. If the steamer's
                     practice improved any, or another shell was thrown, there would be no further
                     doubt, and nothing left for us but to reply as rapidly as possible, with the
                     chance of disabling him, or at least injure the aim of his gunners.</p>
                  <p>"We are all ready to bombard, why the blazes don't they let us bombard?" said
                     one of the crew at the guns, impatiently.</p>
                  <p>Again came the steamer's three guns in succession. The first shot passed
                     through the mainsail, making a rent in it two feet from the mast, and two
                     succeeding shells burst together, the splinters, many of them, driving down
                     upon the vessel.</p>
                  <p>"All ready there?"</p>
                  <p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>
                  <p>"Let her come up a point and a half," I ordered the helmsman.—Any time you're
                     ready there, commence firing," I shouted.</p>
                  <p>"We're all ready, sir, give the word."</p>
                  <p>"Fire, then."</p>
                  <p>The felucca trembled. The smoke enveloped her. Bang went a shell overhead.</p>
                  <p>"Raise your wheel—keep her off—more yet—starboard gun now." And presently the
                     little vessel shook with the second detonation.</p>
                  <p>"Close shooting, old boy, we'll get you next time!" exclaimed Kitler, looking
                     toward the steamer, as one of our shot dashed up the white water close to her
                     port paddle. All around was smoke, for the breeze blew it back upon us, and
                     various exclamations could be heard fore and aft from persons veiled in it.</p>
                  <p>"Look out new men," said the chief of a gun, "take your time, take your time,
                     you've the world before you. Stand shy," and a shell burst low down and the
                     fragments blew shrilly around.</p>
                  <p>"He's after us, boys, he <emph>means us</emph>," said one of the men.</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"That's what I begin to think that I believe that I perceive," jocularly
                     replied another.</p>
                  <p>Deeming that we had got near enough to the Head to clear a sunken reef running
                     out from it, I kept the felucca away till the steamer was off the quarter. The
                     port gun was shifted over to the starboard, and its breeching and side tackles
                     hooked into eyebolts in the plank-shear, conveniently forward of the other gun.
                     This gave us the double advantage of avoiding any loss of headway by yawning,
                     and of sooner getting clear of the head. The steamer, drawing more water, would
                     be compelled to stand further out, while we crossed through a gap in the reef
                     closer in to the head, which was a desirable advantage for the Nautch Girl.</p>
                  <p>"Now hammer away at her," I shouted, as soon as all was ready, "and let that
                     fellow find out that we are not dead."</p>
                  <p>"We'll show him that there is a gun in the Nautch Girl this time," said the
                     gunner of one, pointing the piece. "To the right a leetle more. Steady. Fire."
                     The deck shook, and, as before, we were hid in our own smoke. A shell burst
                     very near. There was a rush among the native crew; and loud exclamations,
                     denoting demoralization. "Fire," came the order from out the sulphurous mist,
                     and the other gun lumbered.</p>
                  <p>Just then there was a crash, and about fifteen feet of the mainyard swung like
                     a broken wing, hanging only by the head rope of the sail. The native crew had
                     rushed together in a close group, gazing at something.</p>
                  <p>"What's the matter there?"</p>
                  <p>"A man killed, sir. Head smashed with a shell splinter."</p>
                  <p>"Are you fellers goin' to stand and gawp at that dead nigger the balance of the
                     fight? Get aft here to this mains'l," shouted Kitler.</p>
                  <p>"Jeffers, did you see that letter. properly started?" exclaimed Mr. Creighton
                     in a voice high above the confusion.</p>
                  <p>Bang went another shell, and the splinters flew from the bulwarks.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, he has it surely; and that's the way he replies."</p>
                  <p>"There's nothing meaner on God's green earth than a renegade Englishman,"
                     shouted Creighton in a frenzy of wrath and excitement, alluding to
                     Kingsley.</p>
                  <p>"Jump up there a light man, and clear that line foul of the end of the yard.
                     Quick's your play now."</p>
                  <p>Bang went a shell, and the fragments sung keenly and struck near.</p>
                  <p>"Lay aloft there, you feller, and lash up that head rope to the yard, <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">sabe!</foreign>" said the boatswain Speed to a Chinese who
                     stood near, in great terror, handing him at the same time a piece of ratline
                     stuff.</p>
                  <p>"No can do," was the response. "All same Pekin side no hab got." meaning that
                     he had never done such a thing in his own country.—He did not want to go.</p>
                  <p>"Jump up there, one of you black scorpions, and lash that head rope before the
                     end drags off the whole sail," roared out Speed, making a rush at one, who
                     nimbly bustled away. No one moved though, and he was about to go himself.</p>
                  <p>"Me <foreign xml:lang="SPA">sabe</foreign>," said a voice, and Speed turning
                     beheld the cabin boy motioning to the crippled spar. "Me <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">sabe</foreign>," he repeated.</p>
                  <p>"Here <foreign xml:lang="SPA">muchacho</foreign>" giving him the ratline stuff,
                     "you're worth a junk-load of them banana bolters."</p>
                  <p>Up went the lad, though several<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6013-00000040" /> shells
                     burst over him while there, and secured the sail from impending damage.</p>
                  <p>Smash went a shot through the <unclear>tip</unclear> of the caboose, tearing it
                     off and scattering tip pans and other vessels about the deck. Crash! came
                     another through Macao Joe's boat, that was hanging from the davits. Again our
                     two bull-dogs replied, making all on board sensible of their presence.</p>
                  <p>"Dam ole Kingsley," growled Macao Joe, looking at his boat; "I wish he been in
                     dat boat right den."</p>
                  <p>"They are warming our ears some," said Creighton. "Our shooting is scandalous.
                     Can't we hit her as all?" he continued in rather a fidget.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes; we've hit her three times, and she's stopped her wheels once. She'll
                     stop them for good, I hope, very soon. There is more motion on this vessel,
                     which is a disadvantage," I answered, as he paced up and down in
                     excitement.</p>
                  <p>"Aim carefully every time," I shouted to the gunners, "there's no time to
                     waste."</p>
                  <p>The men at the guns were stripped to the waist and begrimmed with dust and
                     gunpowder, working like beavers, and squirting tobacco juice about in all
                     directions, with true American abandon.</p>
                  <p>"My child! go down below again" exclaimed Creighton, as Miss Fannie appeared in
                     the smoke, and being a little startled at the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">al
                        fresco</foreign> appearance of the cannoniers, turned to me and said:</p>
                  <p>"I want to see something of this horrid light. Are there any killed?"</p>
                  <p>"One," I answered, feeling quite as uneasy as her father at her presence on
                     deck.</p>
                  <p>"Thank God, there are no more," she returned, fervently.</p>
                  <p>"Fanniel" exclaimed her father, seizing her by the arm, "you must go down
                     below."</p>
                  <p>"She wants to see her American cousins at gineral quarters," said a sailor in
                     an undertone to his neighbor.</p>
                  <p>"Papa, I want to be with you, it is no more secure below than here."</p>
                  <p>"It is a little more so, my daughter there, go down my dear."</p>
                  <p>"That gal's got a good stout gizzard," said a sailor, in honest and respectful
                     admiration. I thought Miss Fannie heard that remark, for she went below again
                     forthwith.</p>
                  <p>"We're one ahead of you yit, Dave," called out one gunner to the other. "You
                     ain't nowhar, we're goin' to hit her agin this time."</p>
                  <p>"Another man hit there?" I asked as there was a rush from the explosion of a
                     shell.</p>
                  <p>"Two more, sir." The score was running up against me. "How will this end?" I
                     thought in an instant. Then came a sharp crash—crack—crack—crash—and the lofty
                     lateen yard came down with a lumbering noise, all hands scattering from it as
                     it fell. The main mast had been shot away about fourteen feet from the deck,
                     and the long yard and fragment of the mast lay partly over the vessel's side, a
                     tangled mass of hamper, which, dragging in the water, brought the felucca
                     broadside to the steamer in spite of her helm, and nearly destroyed her
                     headway.</p>
                  <p>"It is all over," groaned the merchant, sinking down upon the cabin trunk and
                     covering his face with his hands. "My poor child, my poor child."</p>
                  <p>"Keep those guns agoing; what do you stop for? Slue them broadside to, and keep
                     it up. We hav'nt but just commenced to fight yet," I shouted, with a reckless
                     determination never to be taken alive pervading my whole being. "Get that yard
                     clear, Speed; overboard with it. The wind is stiff enough now."</p>
                  <p>We were drawing clear of the Head, and as was expected the breeze was strong
                     and constant.</p>
                  <p>"Git along here, you cussed <foreign>batachong</foreign> eating scoundrels, and
                     help save the ship, or I'll massacre every bloody one of ye," yelled the
                     boatswain.</p>
                  <p>They cut it adrift, while our armament opened on the steamer again, and as the
                     yard and the fragment of the mast were shoved overboard and dragged clear of
                     the Nautch Girl's side, a cheer burst from the begrimmed members of "Gideon's
                     Band."</p>
                  <p>"That rumbled in his coal bunkers," said one.</p>
                  <p>"We hit the ingine ourselves."</p>
                  <p>"No you didn't. She stopped her paddles afore you fellers fired." While they
                     were thus jangling for the honor of the lucky shot, the steamer began to blow
                     off steam, a <choice>
                        <sic>eign</sic>
                        <corr>sign</corr>
                     </choice> that there was no more for the engines to do at present. A loud,
                     enthusiastic cheer from all hands rent the air again; and the felucca payed off
                     with her foresail and sailed joyously out into the broad ocean under her
                     remaining canvas.</p>
                  <p>I have given the incidents of the fight as near as I can recall them. In the
                     confusion incident to such a scene, it is of course difficult, if not
                     impossible, to note particularly all that took place. Suffice it to say that
                     the above is the best picture I can draw of the little transaction off
                     Putterrum Head which has cost me a world of trouble since.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XX—A BURIAL AT SEA.—HEAD MONEY.</head>
                  <p>I now proceed to relate the most unpleasant part of this little history, and in
                     recalling the events previous to chronicling them, my mind is impressed with
                     the melancholy connection, of the weakness of our poor natures, and the truth
                     of the maxim that it is often opportunity and circumstances combined which make
                     us villains; and that temptations and forces of a peculiar character might
                     serve to draw aside and destroy many who are considered above temptation.</p>
                  <p>I have not a doubt but that Jeffers was as innocent of any previously concerted
                     arrangements, looking to the acts which are now to be recorded, as was the
                     merchant's daughter herself; and that the circumstances surrounding the
                     preparation and final departure of the felucca, which may have impressed the
                     reader with a suspicion of his fidelity heretofore, were purely accidental.
                     Subsequent opportunities for obtaining information on these points have led me
                     to this conclusion. It is with me, therefore, a settled conclusion that he was,
                     the night of his arrival on board the Nautch Girl, nothing different from the
                     character of a faithful young man in the employ of Mr. Creighton, and, aside
                     from his one vice of occasional dissipation, merited esteem and confidence.</p>
                  <p>These habits of dissipation were, it is but fair to suppose, more the result of
                     certain perturbed forces of his nature, greatly stimulated by the mental
                     excitement inseparable from various difficult and even dangerous duties of the
                     commercial intrigue at Putterrum, than any natural inclination to vicious
                     courses.</p>
                  <p>The later services, requiring as they did the constant tension of an active and
                     subtle intelligence, and fraught with personal peril to himself as well as his
                     employer, may have assisted, and probably did assist, greatly in increasing the
                     partial or moderate dissipation resulting from the previous life of
                     intrigue.</p>
                  <p>The precise nature of the transactions with which he was thus identified I do
                     not know; in fact, I have never sought to investigate the subject, and am,
                     therefore; but little<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6013-00000041" /> better informed
                     in those respects than is the reader.</p>
                  <p>The latter will, if he has perused the preceding pages with attention, perceive
                     that the character of Jeffers was not very dissimilar to many met in the daily
                     walk through life; and in addition thereto will have noted that he was
                     apparently upon the eve of a change in the habits, hopes and plans for the
                     future, that were fraught with no pleasant anticipations.</p>
                  <p>I shall explain briefly, as they arise in their relation to the remainder of
                     this tale, what events produced these despondent feelings, and what they
                     eventuated in more in detail. After the engagement above described, the
                     felucca, unpursued, passed on her way toward a certain strait leading into the
                     Java Sea. Her departure was taken from Putterrum Head, and the course laid for
                     this highway. But after leaving the land I was desirous of ascertaining if the
                     chronometer had altered its rate, that is, deviated in any way from the true
                     Greenwich time, as this sometimes occurs from much cannonading on board a small
                     vessel. Precautions had been taken to prevent this, but I chose to be certain,
                     and therefore made a run for a certain well known landmark, which was somewhat
                     out of our course and in the vicinity of a chain of small groups of islands,
                     which have served from time <choice>
                        <sic>immemoriai</sic>
                        <corr>immemorial</corr>
                     </choice>, for the hiding places and nests of nefarious and predatory
                     hordes.</p>
                  <p>There was nothing to fear on our part from being in those waters, as our force
                     was amply sufficient to defy any attempt to capture the vessel. But
                     circumstances resulted from going thither which probably gave rise to the first
                     conception of what took place while in those waters.</p>
                  <p>After departing from the direct course to sight the landmark mentioned, I was
                     influenced by the expressed impatience of the merchant to proceed directly
                     through the groups, that no time might be lost in getting on, as would be the
                     case by remaining on the original course. The vessel was put in as good trim as
                     possible after the loss of her mainsail, and as the length of the passage,
                     hardly justified the delay of putting in anywhere for repairs, we kept on the
                     course. On the morning following that on which we escaped from the steamer the
                     three dead men were properly prepared for burial, and the felucca hove to with
                     the colors set at half mast. There was no man on board qualified by consistent
                     Christian character to read the burial service, and it was about to be omitted,
                     I not choosing to trifle with the sacred offices though it is often done by
                     non-professing captains.</p>
                  <p>The bodies were placed side by side upon planks, the ends of which rested on
                     the rail and the starboard gun. Around them in a semi-circle were grouped the
                     men in reverential silence. In the absence of any religious ceremonial I had
                     ordered a salute of ten guns to be fired, and the men requisite for that duty
                     were at their stations.</p>
                  <p>"Stand by," I said to those who were to raise the planks, thus sliding the
                     bodies into the deep.</p>
                  <p>Miss Creighton's light touch turned me toward her.</p>
                  <p>"You surely are not going to launch them overboard yet," she asked.</p>
                  <p>"How else, what shall I do more?"</p>
                  <p>Handing me her Bible, the only one on board, she said: "For the sake of their
                     poor heathen comrades, show the remains a common Christian respect. All sea
                     captains do so much."</p>
                  <p>I took the small Bible, and failing to find a proper chapter after a protracted
                     search among the leaves, during which some slight mirth was manifest among the
                     men at my ignorance of the book, 1 gave it to her again, a little vexed.</p>
                  <p>"I will read it," she said.</p>
                  <p>"Very good."</p>
                  <p>All gave profound attention, and listened to the soothing tones, breathing
                     lowly and sweetly Immanuel's promise to the world.—After a selected chapter she
                     recited the Episcopal burial service for the dead at sea. At the words, "we
                     therefore commit these bodies to the deep," the corpses were launched overboard
                     and sank from view. "Looking for the resurrection of their spirits when the sea
                     shall give up its dead," she concluded solemnly, and then rejoined her father,
                     who had been standing at the taffrail.</p>
                  <p>The yards were braced forward, and the Nautch Girl once more started on her
                     way.</p>
                  <p>That day one of the crew, a rough untaught young man, whose leisure hours from
                     childhood had been spent in rum-mills and engine houses, was heard pondering
                     the words, "I have fought the good fight, I have kept the faith, I have
                     finished my course," probably the first words of Holy Writ that had ever
                     attained a lodgment in his mind.</p>
                  <p>The men killed were natives, hardly known to their own comrades, and were soon
                     forgotten. The watches were set, and even with the loss of her mainsail, the
                     felucca went merrily along; the wind being from astern, its loss was not so
                     much felt.</p>
                  <p>A few hours after, while taking the sun at noon for latitude, there was a
                     little commotion around the <choice>
                        <sic>ferehatch</sic>
                        <corr>forehatch</corr>
                     </choice>, and shortly the crew, in a body, approached the quarter deck,
                     bringing with them a strange native. He had been discovered in the forehold,
                     stowed away, and refused to account to them for his presence there. After
                     completing the observation I asked him who he was, but his reply was
                     unintelligible. He was half naked, and wore on his head a close fitting skull
                     cap of straw, and was variously tattoed on his chest and arms. Jeffers spoke a
                     few words with him, and turning to me, said:</p>
                  <p>"He says he can tell something it you will promise that he shall not be
                     hurt."</p>
                  <p>He was assured of protection, and Jeffers and the natives had a longer
                     conference. Then, turning to me, the former said:</p>
                  <p>"It is as I thought. This is one of that bangkong's crew; they were all from
                     among the neighboring islands under their own chief, and were to have had ten
                     thousand dollars for murdering every person on board this vessel but the 'white
                     woman.' His story was, in substance, that he was thrown overboard by his own
                     oar when the felucca ran into the bangkong, and was caught against the stem of
                     the vessel, to which he clung till she shot past. Climbing inboard by the head
                     rigging, he had taken advantage of the darkness and other favoring
                     circumstances to secrete himself in the forehold, until his fellows should get
                     on board."</p>
                  <p>By their failure to do so he found himself at the mercy of those he had sought
                     to kill, and shrewdly created the impression on our minds that he was a common
                     stowaway from Putterrum, until he had received assurance of safety. He was
                     hurt, and evidently in pain, for his side and arm were much swollen; but he
                     bore it with stolid stoicism, and chewed his betel quid as he gazed around upon
                     the faces of the Nautch Girl's crew with apparent nonchalance. The native
                     claimed to have been ignorant of the object of the expedition when he left for
                     Putterrum, and refused to give the name of his chief, or his haunts.</p>
                  <p>He was a murderous-looking savage<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6013-00000042" /> age,
                     though I contemplated him with no resentful emotion, as he was but a more
                     ignorant creature of the grand old scoundrel at Putterrum, and we were now free
                     of him for good.</p>
                  <p>The crew were directed to interfere with him in no manner, and none sought to
                     do so, though some members of Gideon's Band expressed a desire to "mug him a
                     little."</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XXI—ANOTHER PASSENGER</head>
                  <p>We made the "land-fall" of the headland before alluded to, and I found the
                     chronometer nothing out of the way whatever; but here our course was altered,
                     and the wind being abeam, the felucca behaved so unsatisfactorily without the
                     mainsail that, after a consultation with Macao Joe and my other officers, I
                     determined to put in at a small island then in sight to get a spar for a jury
                     mainmast and set the foresail upon it, putting the driver or after sail in its
                     place. Mr. Creighton expressed some uneasiness at this delay, but it was
                     unavoidable. A few hours brought us off the entrance to the river, and abreast
                     of a small collection of huts supposed to be a town. Macao Joe went ashore, to
                     look out a suitable spar. No sooner had the felucca's bows headed in toward the
                     settlement than a number of boats came off, and as soon as the anchor was down
                     most of them came alongside. One of them contained a Spanish-looking gentleman
                     who, from his dress and appearance looked out of place in that unfrequented
                     village. He came to seek a passage elsewhere, anywhere in fact, stating that he
                     had been cast away on a neighboring island, and had removed hither with his
                     crew as a port more likely to receive a visit from prahus and other native
                     craft He gave his name as A. Mucia, and showed me papers for the brig
                     Restorador, of which he was master, sailing out of the port of Manilla. He had
                     fourteen men on shore whom he would bring on board, when we were ready to sail.
                     Some of them came off in boats afterward, fraternizing with our crew. They were
                     an ordinary lot of Philippine Islanders. We consented to take him and his men
                     to Singapore, he urging that it was very sickly here, his mate having died
                     during the two weeks that they had been in the place. The weather at that time,
                     however, was very dry and salubrious for such a locality. When Macao Joe's boat
                     arrived, towing the spar, all hands turned to, including the Spanish crew, who
                     were on board, and the spar was lashed firmly to the stump of the other. A
                     short time sufficed to rig it and shirt the heavy lateen yards. When all was in
                     readiness, the wrecked crew being by that time all on board, the anchor was
                     picked up again, and we stood out upon the voyage. Mucia seemed a very pleasant
                     companion, and his crew were prompt, handy seamen. They were however quite
                     superfluous, as the felucca's crew was more than sufficient without them, and
                     the deck was very much crowded in consequence.</p>
                  <p>Captain Mucia seemed very much "taken," to use the word, with Miss Creighton's
                     appearance, and, having a guitar belonging to one of his own men, sang some
                     Spanish, ballads or madrigals, for her benefit, no doubt, as they contained a
                     great deal of Spanish love sentiment. He was a good-looking man, about thirty
                     five, tall, pale, and with a thick, black mustache. He was the personification
                     of a Spanish bandit of the stage, though with much less open hardihood than the
                     simon pure article that the soldiers bring to the villages of Spain on ox-wains
                     or mules from time to time. He showed his white teeth with a bland smile
                        when<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6013-00000043" /> Miss Creighton was on deck,
                     and was apparently desirous to make her acquaintance, but she seemed to avoid
                     him, and he never expressed a wish to know her, either to Jeffers or
                     myself.</p>

                  <p>It was on the fourth day out from the island that I noticed that he and Jeffers
                     were growing tolerably intimate, and were often exchanging low hurried words
                     together. I had observed, also, something that gave me some little thought and
                     perplexity. Miss Creighton had appeared to avoid my society, and, though the
                     weather was fine, remained most of the time secluded in the privacy of her own
                     cabin, Whenever she appeared on deck, when I was present, she bowed distantly,
                     and avoided the vicinity where I stood. An unmistakable change had come over
                     her in that regard, and, of course, a change likewise came o'er the spirit of
                     my dream. With Mucia or myself she held no converse, though I observed her
                     regarding me, when alone, with a certain expression the interpretation of which
                     was beyond my penetration. Captain Mucia she seemed also to shun, and after a
                     few days would return to the cabin when he appeared upon the quarter deck.
                     Jeffers, likewise, had but little speech with me.</p>

                  <head>Why Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar cures so many diseases.</head>
                  <p>Every one knows that Tar is one of the most powerful modifiers of the mucous
                     membrane, and this membrane lines the Stomach, Intestines, Throat, Lungs,
                     Bladder, &amp;c. &amp;c. and it is its action upon this membrane which gives
                     "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" such great success, and gives it the prominent place
                     it now has in the world. "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" is a clear fluid, divested
                     of all foreign matter, rich in the medicinal properties of Tar, pleasant to the
                     taste, and endowed with efficacious properties. Try one bottle.</p>
                  <p>A farmer living in Zell Township, four miles west of Boonsboro, Iowa, named
                     Harrison McCloskey, contracted a severe cold early in the Spring of 1868. He
                     could get no relief—grew worse, spit blood, had severe pain in his side and
                     breast, night sweats, loss of appetite, and could do no work of any kind. He
                     was completely cured by the use of Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar, and has gained
                     twenty-five pounds in weight, no cough, good appetite, and able to do any
                     work.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman in West Cornwall, Conn. named Hamilton B. Howard, writes that he
                     has used Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar for Bronchitis, and <emph>it has entirely
                        cured him</emph>, although his family physician pronounced his case beyond
                     cure. A friend who knew the merit of Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar, prevailed on him
                     to try it, and he sends permission to publish his statement.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXII.—(CONTINUED.)</head>
                  <p>Mr. Creighton had always observed a distant demeanor; and I began to consider
                     that my peculiar and perhaps valuable services being now nearly performed, the
                     whole trio were en trenching themselves behind a "rocky" civility preparatory
                     to repudiating me altogether.</p>
                  <p>Finally, though it was of no consequence however, Captain Mucia declined to sit
                     at board with the rest of the men, and took his meals afterward, making it
                     satisfactory to the steward with a little gold. This arrangement I could, of
                     course, have interfered with, but he ascribed as a reason for this very unusual
                     procedure that he was accustomed to certain ours from long habit, and that any
                     departure from them interfered with his digestion.</p>
                  <p>I reflected upon the changed demeanor of these persons, and determined to seek
                     a solution of it. With this in view, approaching Miss Creighton one evening at
                     sundown, as she stood at the taffrail watching the immersion of the day-god in
                     the blue ocean, which twinged, as it settled away for the night, the horizon
                     clouds with a crimson halo, I said:</p>
                  <p>"Miss Creighton, I have seen so little of you for the past few days that the
                     time begins to hang very heavily."</p>
                  <p>This was, perhaps, as awkward a remark as could have been found by searching,
                     and was not what I probably meant to say, but at the first words that were
                     spoken, a fixed expression of pity and sorrow was so apparent, as she turned
                     her gaze upon me, that I proceeded mechanically, without thought, and uttered
                     what was uppermost in my mind.</p>
                  <p>She moved toward the companion way, and with somewhat of the air of a lady who
                     has been accosted by an utter stranger without justifying circumstances,
                     replied:</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry that my society is so necessary to your comfort. I trust the
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> you experience will be only
                     temporary," and moved to the companion way. She stopped half way down the
                     steps, then turning as she had done once before, added hurriedly, "I must see
                     you once more—alone—to-night in the midwatch I will be on deck," and
                     descended.</p>
                  <p>"There is a nigger in the wood pile somewhere," I said inwardly, with an
                     expressive south-western phrase, and went down to supper.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXIII—SOUNDING.</head>
                  <p>At the table Jeffers remarked:</p>
                  <p>"Captain," (he had adopted this title within the last few days), "you will have
                     a little trouble to get a tough, pliant spar like the one lost off the
                     'Head.'"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but I presume one can be got for the money at Singapore, where the vessel
                     was built," was my reply.</p>
                  <p>"Captain Mucia was remarking that you would be more likely to get repairs
                     cheaper and sooner at R—s, and as that is a convenient port to make from the
                     Straits, I would be highly pleased myself to look in there, for though it is a
                     small port like Putterrum, it is a veritable <foreign xml:lang="LAT">multum in
                        parvo</foreign>, and the great rendezvous for the petty Malay chiefs, when
                     concocting a short moneymaking war. There would be a chance for you to
                     determine easily the best business to place the Nautch Girl in."</p>
                  <p>"I know the place somewhat from report, and from rumors respecting it I should
                     think it was a much worse hole than Putterrum, if that were possible. You speak
                     as though you were not bound for England with Mr. Creighton. How is that?</p>
                  <p>"No, I am not," he replied.</p>
                  <p>"That is a late determination, is it not?"</p>
                  <p>"No, not very. Fate seems to point out a different road, and I must follow
                     it.</p>
                  <p>"You believe in <foreign xml:lang="TUR">kismet</foreign> then?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but in a different way from the Mohammedan fatalists."</p>
                  <p>"What is your schism in that respect?"</p>
                  <p>"I prefer to think that it is the tendency of mankind to gravitate downward in
                     this world, and that circumstances, may produce an opportunity to overcome this
                     gravitation. It is destiny to embrace or neglect these chances."</p>
                  <p>"That is a sort of Oriental adjunct to Shakspeare's 'tide in the affairs of
                     men," &amp;c. I said, feeling all this was but a prelude to something.</p>
                  <p>"Precisely. A manifest train of circumstances seems to suggest a certain course
                     to achieve happiness, and the contrary one offers nothing but misery."</p>
                  <p>"And does the first clearly promise happiness?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>He seemed to be reflecting, and answered slowly:</p>
                  <p>"There might be some happiness come of it."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Jeffers, if you choose to make a confidant of me, you can get my
                     poor opinion upon it," I replied carelessly.</p>
                  <p>"I want your opinion, and the outline of what has changed my prospect is
                     briefly this: Mr. Creighton has informed me that a handsome quarterly allowance
                     will be paid to me at Singapore or elsewhere, so fixed as to be subject to no
                     alteration or reduction so long as I remain out here, or at least do not visit
                     England. That act would cut off the stipendium. This, together with a
                     comfortable bonus which he offers, I am at liberty to accept or refuse, and the
                     condition is binding for his lifetime only.</p>
                  <p>"All the world beside England, Ireland and Scotland is open to you, is it?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"I should take it. There is a land toward which my heart yearns now, a land w
                     where liberty and citizenship are open to all, and whose people proper claim
                     kindred with their English cousins who choose its government as their adopted
                     one. You can go there."</p>
                  <p>"But still America is not England; and Englishmen, though they leave it for
                     years, only leave it, in the hope to return and dwell more comfortably on its
                     soil," he replied.</p>
                  <p>"What means are to be furnished you even in case you decline the first
                     offer?"</p>
                  <p>"None. I have saved a portion of my salary, which was ample, and looked forward
                     to continue in his employ in some way in England."</p>
                  <p>I reflected, but never once dreamed of the subject he sought to approach.</p>
                  <p>"Was this alternative offered before leaving Putterrum?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"It was. A year ago, nearly, he said in a conversation relating to his
                     departure, 'Once clear of Putterrum and the Rajah's clutches, you will be
                     provided <choice>
                        <sic>for for</sic>
                        <corr>for</corr>
                     </choice> life, and it is to be hoped then that you will make it a useful and
                     happy one for all concerned, and abstain totally from these occasionally
                     frolics and dissipation, which are dangerous. Do you understand me?" These were
                     about his words. I have utterly mistaken their meaning, and interpreted them
                     far differently. I think now that he intended that I should construe them as I
                     did. At all events, as nothing more was spoken in that connection, and nothing
                     was noticed by me to suggest a different meaning to them, I remained buoyant
                     with a fallacious hope—a hope that has been abruptly dispelled in a recent
                     conversation which I had with him just before our last at Putterrum."</p>
                  <p>I did not yet guess at the true nature of his disappointment. In fact, the
                     manner in which he approached this confidential disclosure tended naturally to
                     lead a listener away from the real cause of his despondency, which was,
                     notwithstanding his affected commonplace demeanor, evidently very keen.</p>
                  <p>"Do you feel," he asked, after a pause, "that you have been sufficiently
                     rewarded for the risk you have taken, and the inconvenience and jeopardy to
                     which that fight off Putterrum Head will subject you in the future?"</p>
                  <p>This was a question that had some interest for me; and he proceeded to point
                     out what future complications would arise out of the affair in various ways.
                     When he paused again I replied:</p>
                  <p>"This comes rather unexpectedly from you, at whose hands I undertook the
                     business."</p>
                  <p>"It may look strange," he replied "but the probabilities of such a fight as
                     took place, and the bloodshed which may have resulted on the steamer as well as
                     this vessel, were distant, and not at all to be apprehended. Provision was to
                     be made to avoid anything more than the mere semblance of an attempt upon the
                     felucca, as you have heard. This was a failure, and but for your determined
                     resistance, Creighton and his daughter would now have been back to Putterrum,
                     and the town all agog with excitement. It was worth a handsome sum in ready
                     money, in addition to a dismasted felucca of this size, to have taken the
                     consequences of such resistance, saying nothing of the immediate personal risk.
                     Perhaps he<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6013-00000045" /> will consider it in the
                     settlement, speaking commercially," I answered willing to lead on to what was
                     to follow. Jeffers continued:</p>
                  <p>"I doubt it. To say the truth," I mentioned the <choice>
                        <sic>subjsct</sic>
                        <corr>subject</corr>
                     </choice> to him. His reply was, as near as I can recall it: I have paid
                     enough. The young man knows his price, and faced the consequences to earn the
                     vessel and the money offered. I want to get away from this cursed country, and
                     wash my hands forever of all adventurers roving up and down it."</p>
                  <p>That remark stung me. In connection with the coolness of himself and daughter;
                     and the attempt to view me now in the light of a common hireling, taking
                     bowstring risks and hard knocks for money, I began to acknowledge to myself the
                     unenviable position that circumstances had led me to assume.</p>

                     left the cuddy. Other conversation followed. Speed said:</p>
                  <p>"Did you ever see our cabin boy before, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"No, not that I remember," I answered.</p>
                  <p>"He's seed you. I heard him tellin' one of them Spanish chaps something about

                  <p>"Humph; he is mistaken, I presume, in the person. I don't think he ever laid

                  <p>"Nothin', only I think he has done you some dammidge with—some folks." He
                     stopped with a look that indicated more to tell.</p>
                  <p>"Go ahead," I said.</p>
                  <p>"Ye see the lad is a harmless boy, and was tellin' somethin' of you in great

                     Guv'ner-Gineral,' and a hull string of devilments and rigs that you was up to
                     with three or four other wimmin, ontill bimeby I looked across the deck and saw
                     the young lady <unclear>harbin</unclear> to it all, and lookin' mighty sollum;
                     and then arterwards she called him down aft. and the skylight bein up I could
                     hear her askin him questions, and it 'peared like she was tryin to pump outen
                     him all he knowed. If you haint got your bonus for this here voyage, you'd
                     better stop up that young colt's mouth, or any rigs that would be much agin you
                     might git to the old man, and he havin them sort o' things to go on, might try
                     to waller outen payin you what he 'greed. I know this part of the world
                     powerful well, powerful well."</p>
                  <p>"Was there anything else that was unusual?" I asked, without noticing his sage
                     deductions.</p>
                  <p>"Well, agin I seed that Captain a askin him questions, and then, lastly, the
                     old man, and the other one, Mr. Jeffers had him and was talkin to him—fust one,
                     then the other—and the boy, he was tellin everything he ever seed and knowed,
                     and lots, I reckon, what he just cunjered jered up. I couldn't hear what he
                     said; but this I know, they are after gittin some hold on you, to git outen
                     nayin us all our jest dues."</p>
                  <p>I assured him that he need have no fears on that score; that I was responsible
                     for their wages, and that they would be paid liberally on our arrival in port.
                     Leaving them to discuss it with themselves, I went on deck.</p>
                  <p>Macao Joe was in conversation with Mucia in the waist. Jeffers was at the
                     taffrail smoking his cares away, and the merchant was pacing up and down the
                     quarter deck. He cast a gleaming eye of distrust at me, and left the weather
                     side of the deck, which by custom belongs to the captain of the vessel, though
                     when the relations between him and his passengers are cordial, it is shared
                     with them in promenading. This relation he chose to disclaim, by leaving the
                     windward side. I went to look at the compass. The binnacle was just aft of the
                     companion-way leading to his cabin. Miss Creighton stood near it. I looked in
                     her face as I stood at the binnacle fronting her. It bore no expression of
                     recognition. Her eyes met mine, and were averted instantly; but there was a
                     sadness in them that at once raised my apprehensions that some mysterious
                     mischief was upon me, and the dream flashed across my mind, and the
                     presentiment before alluded to returned with redoubled force. I was upon the
                     point of speaking to her, but, as if mistrusting my intention, she withdrew
                     from the companion way. I turned away pondering upon the irritating and yet
                     unapproachable status of affairs. Jeffers approached and said:</p>
                  <p>"When the cabin is vacant I will converse with you there upon a subject that I
                     think will interest you," and then moved to the waist, joining Mucia and Macao
                     Joe there.</p>
                  <p>"The mid-watch will tell the tale," I muttered, and went down to my stateroom
                     to examine my chart, after calling to Macao Joe to have the deep-sea led hove
                     every hour and pass the order to Kitler in his watch, and not to shoal less
                     than twenty fathoms without calling me. While sitting at the chart I heard the
                     merchant's voice, as if to some one, repeat my soliloquy:</p>
                  <p>"The mid-watch will tell the tale."</p>
                  <p>The responding voice was Mucia's and the words were:</p>
                  <p>"Ha! So soon as that? Let us take care of him at once, then. He is known to be
                     a desperate fellow, and must be surprised."</p>
                  <p>My first impulse was to rush on deck, and demand an explanation; but prudence
                     dictated another course I listened, and felt justified under the
                     circumstances.</p>
                  <p>"Take your own course, Captain Mucia; and be assured that you will have my
                     hearty endorsement and co-operation. Your penetration and sagacity have
                     confirmed my latent suspicions, and I am ready to authorize any step you may
                     advise.—Why, he is the most accomplished scoundrel that ever existed, and this
                     a specimon of the refinement of rascality. This part of the world is the great
                     hive of his kind. He is certainly very young for such turpitude."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Creighton, we will have his smooth, innocent countenance looking
                     through a grating, before long," said Mucia.</p>
                  <p>"Lord! was there ever such a villain? But I suspected him; I suspected him from
                     a certain circumstance<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6013-00000046" /> stance which is
                     not important to mention now."</p>
                  <p>"We had better wait till he commits himself to your business man, Mr. Jeffers,
                     who intends to draw him out to-night with a promised co-operation."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, Mr. Jeffers, will you?" I thought.</p>
                  <p>What in the name of mystery they were alluding to was beyond my powers to
                     surmise.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXV—THE INTRIGUE SUCCEEDS, AND THE NAUTCH GIRL CHANGES HANDS.</head>
                  <p>"What to do now," was the query uppermost in my mind, and as often as I
                     recurred to the vexatious and threatening aspect of affairs surrounding me, did
                     the foreboding arise of the consequence of a single rash or impolitic step.
                     Conscious of my own rectitude and innocence of any premeditated villainy, I was
                     utterly at a loss to conceive how it was in the remotest degree feasible for me
                     to commit any act inimical to the welfare of Mr. Creighton or any person on
                     board the vessel. Sitting down again as the conversation ceased, I leaned upon
                     the table to collect my turbulent thoughts. A low voice sounded through the
                     bulkhead air-port, which was left open for the circulation of air. It was Miss
                     Creighton's voice, and I listened again, now free from all compunctions on that
                     score. I even got up and placed my ear to the air port. She was at prayer. I
                     heard the earnest words of supplication, "May this danger now threatening be
                     averted without the shedding of blood. And may this poor misguided young man,
                     upon whose soul rests the stain of many crimes, be led away from the dark,
                     dangerous path which he has known, to the bright tranquility of a Christian
                     life. Oh, God! let the prayerful entreaty of one—if but one there be—not fall
                     unavailing in behalf of his lost soul."</p>
                  <p>I waited to hear no more; the deep pathos of the voice, pouring out in anguish
                     a supplication to the throne above in my behalf, thrilled every fibre of my
                     body. With feelings easily imagined I rushed to the deck. Confronting Mr.
                     Creighton, the first person in view, I said:</p>
                  <p>"Sir, I have overheard a conversation between you and Captain Mucia, relating
                     to me, that requires explanation, and I will have it now. I have no time to
                     wait. Of what am I suspected, and what are the grounds?"</p>
                  <p>"Talk to me, sir. I am in command here," and turning, I beheld Mucia. He
                     continued: "Any attempt to get up a row, and you cast your life away."</p>
                  <p>He held a revolver down at his side. The long steel barrel looked cold and
                     bright in the light of the binnacle lamp. To die then, with the horrible
                     unknown suspicion resting upon my memory, with her mind unenlightened, and the
                     story in shreds and patches finding its way back to those in my own native
                     town, was more repugnant and appalling than a score of common deaths. This
                     dread was all that restrained me from springing upon Mucia with the strength
                     that deep-seated hatred only can give, and tearing the acknowledgment of his
                     villainy from his throat.</p>
                  <p>I comprehended then the whole position, and my thoughts, with the readiness of
                     a mind accustomed to action in danger, settled at once upon the whole plot. We
                     gazed at each other a short moment, and in that brief period I had read him
                     through. He had blackleg and sharper stamped in every lineament. Low-lived and
                     ambitious, just such men can be seen around the hells of New York; thimble
                     riggers and other mustached pusillanimous thieves. This one was, also, an
                     American. He had admitted to American birth and residence previously. But now
                     the New York sharper was plainly to be seen. To be confronted and held in check
                     on the quarter deck of my own vessel by such a person as was this Captain
                     Mucia, was a humiliating thing, such as I hope will never be my lot to
                     experience again. I never forgave him. That he longed for a pretext to take my
                     life, safe from consequences by the impossibility of afterproof, and protected
                     in the crime by the co-operation of the wealthy merchant, was clearly apparent.
                     I was careful not to give him the chance he coveted. This desire was more
                     strikingly evinced by his anxiety to create some confusion that would justify
                     the murder. He cried in a loud tone:</p>
                  <p>"Your jig is up, young gentleman, and now what do you think of your deep laid
                     scheme?" at the same time rudely grasping my shoulder. To my ear, accustomed to
                     the various accents of New York city, his whole character was so openly
                     exhibited that a mingled feeling of pity, contempt and wonder swept through my
                     mind at the gullibility of a man who had baffled the untiring watchfulness of
                     an eastern despot and his host of spies, only to fall into this sharper's
                     arms.</p>
                  <p>The man, finding that he could not provoke a struggle by threats, gave me a
                     slight jerk, saying:</p>
                  <p>"Down you go into the hold; you can't play any tricks upon an old sea-captain
                     like me; come along." In that last remark he gave me another clew to his
                     character, which was the discovery that he was not a captain of anything. Then
                     speedily fell into connection a chain of circumstances, trivial at the time,
                     and till now out of mind, proofs strong and confirming the opinion. He
                     attempted to drag me, but I remained immovable, repressing my emotions. I
                     replied calmly:</p>
                  <p>"Keep your hands away. I will obey you implicitly for a time." The man at the
                     wheel, one of Gideon's Band, now commenced to beckon to those in the waist.</p>
                  <p>"Look at that rascal. You rascal, what do you mean," exclaimed Creighton,
                     excitedly. Then turning to me: "Now, sir, if you attempt to precipitate a
                     disturbance, your life is not worth a baubee, not two pice, sir." Still more
                     excitedly. "You infernal villain, after my exceedingly liberal treatment."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, there's no use to talk to such as him, sir, in any style like that. He
                     wants his head shaved and stripes on him; that's what he wants now,"
                     interrupted the ambitious Mucia, with a sort of policeman tone.</p>
                  <p>The men had now gathered at the break of the quarter deck, and some commotion
                     was threatening.</p>
                  <p>"You're too late, you chaps," said Mucia, "the best thing you can do is to deny
                     hav'n anything to do with it at all, and I do'no as you'll get off<pb n="92-93"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000047" /> then. I intend to straighten this whole thing
                     out before I'm done with it." Then to me, with a slight shake, "You're a purty
                     man, you are, this gen'lman here with his daughter—</p>
                  <p>"H—l, Doc, what's the matter with you?" roared out one of the Americans. "Are
                     you dead, or shill I git there. Come, boys—"</p>
                  <p>"The rascals," roared Creighton. "Get back, every one of you. Your devilish
                     leader is at the end of his rope, and every one of you will see the inside of
                     an English prison shortly."</p>
                  <p>"Fellers—," said the sailor.</p>
                  <p>"Silence!" shouted Mucia.</p>
                  <p>Kitler and Speed now stepped up to the group, and Jeffers, I found, had been
                     standing behind me with a cutlass. The helmsman was steering wild, and the
                     rattle of the sails drew the attention of Mucia.</p>
                  <p>"Keep your course there, there's nothin' to be excited about. Oh, you're one of
                        <emph>his</emph> crowd, of course you're a little shaky. Relieve the wheel
                     there—a good man, some man you know, sir (this last to Jeffers.)</p>
                  <p>Speed, deeming that moment the proper one for him to speak, expressed himself
                     in about these words:</p>
                  <p>"There's some onaccountable mistake here, sir; or else you're tryin' to git
                     around pay in us all what we've honestly earned a fightin for ye. I
                     thought"—</p>
                  <p>"Look a-here now, I'm captain of this boat now, and I want you to know it. Git
                     back where you belong," exclaimed Mucia quickly; "we're fixed for you fellahs;
                     you can't do anything with <emph>me</emph>. You are come to put in an oar too,
                     are you?" (this to Kitler.)</p>
                  <p>"Ef so be you'll hear me speak, sir," said Kitler to Creighton, not deigning to
                     look at Mucia, "I mought."</p>
                  <p>"Shut up your jaw now right off, right off," said Mucia, interrupting him. "Do
                     you see that party?" pointing to his own men, armed with cutlasses and pistols,
                     and a part of the native crew, armed likewise.</p>
                  <p>Creighton looked about, "Where's Jeffers?"</p>
                  <p>"Here I am, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Jeffers, do remain right here at the companion stairs with Fannie; there's
                     going to be an attempt at mutiny, I know it; they are—"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>I'll</emph> see that no harm comes to your daughter, sir," broke in
                     Mucia with an air. "That's what I'm goin to do. Stand by, our side. I'd better
                     shoot this dog right off to begin with."</p>
                  <p>In the waist were voices in all tones of disputation and wonderment. For
                     example:</p>
                  <p>"Here men, let's take and clean out this ranch at one swipe. We kin do it,"
                     cried Scotty.</p>
                  <p>"What's that bloody thief there callin himself captain fur?" demanded Speed.
                     Macao Joe, confronting Scotty, said:</p>
                  <p>"You dam Merikan raskal, what fur you—"</p>
                  <p>Gideon's Band: "Bust him, bust him."</p>
                  <p>Scotty: "Do you take that sort of talk? Let me get there."</p>
                  <p>And soon, as I feared, a row was the consequence, the very thing I hoped to
                     avoid, and for which end I restrained my own raging wrath, having a definite
                     result to attain by another and the only safe course.</p>
                  <p>"Shall I shoot him, shall I shoot him?" exclaimed Mucia, presenting the
                     revolver within a few inches of my face. It was time for me to speak. Turning
                     to him. I said:</p>
                  <p>"Stand back, sir, if you want to prevent the shedding of blood."</p>
                  <p>Then turning to the crew, I said:</p>
                  <p>"Men, if you wish me to command this vessel, heed my orders now. Remain quiet;
                     you can do so much for me. I am charged with some crime which I infer is an
                     attempt to take this vessel.</p>
                  <p>"That's about the size of it," interjected Mucia; "and the money," he
                     added.</p>
                  <p>"The absurdity of which will of itself speedily become apparent unless you are
                     precipitated into a disturbance to give coloring to it, which can only result
                     in defeat, as you are unarmed, and every one outside of 'Gideon's Band' is in
                     league against you. If this were not so I would have sounded the battle-cry
                     long ago."</p>

                  <p>"His head's level."</p>
                  <p>"Go ahead old fel," and similar responses.</p>
                  <p>"Wonderful rascal, wonderful to the last degree. What consummate acting!"
                     exclaimed Creighton.</p>
                  <p>Oh yes, they are goin to try and git out of it now," then turning to me. "But
                     it's no use, not a bit of use; you'd had better acknowledge the whole thing,
                     and this gen'lman will—"</p>
                  <p>"I promise no clemency; not at all. No sir, the law must take its usual course:
                     Such dangerous men ought not to be at large," broke in Creighton,
                     excitedly.</p>
                  <p>"Well, we must put 'em all in irons now, at any rate," said the hero of the
                     hour. "Have you any irons on board? I don't suppose you have. Well, we can get
                     up something that will do as well. Fetch that small spar here, one of you,"
                     calling to his men. Then addressing the crew: "Now all of you fellers that has
                     been up to this thing, if you want to get off light, make no resistance
                     whatever, and it shall all be sifted fine, and the leadin' ones will have to
                     stand it, and the rest will get off light. I advise you not to make any
                     resistance, or you will not make anything by it, now I can tell you. Tie them
                     fellers up! Go right along with it!"</p>
                  <p>"Stop," I exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>"What have you got to say; you've got to have a good lashin up, you have; I'll
                     fix you myself, I've seen your kind before," returned the hero.</p>
                  <p>"You can never succeed in getting those men tied up without a fight. Neither
                     will I suffer myself to be bound by such as you, or any one else in this prahu.
                     If you want to create a disturbance that may end seriously, and lend some
                     feeble plausibility to your absurd charges, the whole object of which is to
                     ingratiate yourself into the good opinion of Mr. Creighton and his daughter,
                     with a view of obtaining money, and—"</p>
                  <p>"Dry up right there!" he interrupted, giving me a jerk.</p>
                  <p>"You dirty New York blackleg," I shouted, losing all control; and seizing him
                     by the throat with the whole hatred of my body concentrated in my fingers, I
                     threw him heavily upon the deck and hung at his throat. His pistol was
                     discharged, wounding us both, but at the time I did not know I was touched. The
                     men of Gideon's Band rushed to us;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6013-00000048" /> and
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">per contra</foreign>, the others feeling the
                     security of their numbers and arms, assaulted them, dealing cutlass blows
                     without mercy.</p>
                  <p>It was a very boisterous, tumultuous little fight, and lasted some minutes,
                     ending in the defeat of the American party, though not until they had dealt
                     some ghastly wounds upon their assailants. One Lascar was stamped senseless,
                     while a Chinese sailor and Macao Joe were both cut seriously in the face and
                     head with the heavy brass belaying pins of our party. I did not let go my hold
                     on Mucia's throat till compelled to do so to extricate myself from the crowd
                     above me. Several pistol shots were fired, and one of the Americans was badly
                     wounded. Many of them had cutlass wounds upon the head, and all hands of us
                     were bloody and dirty. "Gideon's Band," disdaining to leave the field, remained
                     on the quarter deck. It seemed that the cessation was only to get breath, as
                     the combatants still remained panting in front of each other. The extreme odds
                     against us gave no hope of success, we being at the time totally unarmed, which
                     made it expedient to make use of a little strategy, which was suddenly
                     conceived and put into execution with equal celerity.</p>
                  <p>"A way to the forecastle," I shouted, and sprang forward, followed by our
                     party. I did not, however, get many steps before the momentary paralysis
                     occasioned by the wound in my leg caused me to stagger, and support myself by
                     clutching the caboose lashing. At that instant Mucia, who had regained his
                     feet, covered me with his revolver and fired twice; but his hand shook so
                     violently with the excitement of the recent struggle that both bullets whizzed
                     harmlessly by. He was cocking the weapon again when Miss Creighton darting
                     forward wrenched it from hand and brought it to me, saying, as she did so, "You
                     shall not be killed like a mad dog." She then returned to the companion
                     way.</p>
                  <p>"Here is certain death for three men. Who will go first?" I said, cocking the
                     pistol and presenting it toward the group.</p>
                  <p>"I am going to my stateroom," I continued, "who will prevent me?" Then turning
                     toward Creighton, who stood apart, I remarked: "I resign the vessel to your
                     charge, and shall make no more resistance, except to defend myself against
                     violence. I am now as anxious for the courts as you can possibly be, and this
                     night's work has wrought you no good."</p>
                  <p>"Threatening me is idle sir. But as your followers are now safe, you can remain
                     in your stateroom until I get out of the vessel, but any attempt to communicate
                     with your infamous associates will be followed by immediate <choice>
                        <sic>confinemeut</sic>
                        <corr>confinement</corr>
                     </choice>."</p>
                  <p>"My followers were not 'infamous' were they, when they fought the steamer to
                     secure the safety of you and your daughter?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't wish to bandy words with you, sir. If you know when you are well off,
                     you will go quietly below. You have forfeited your right to expect this vessel,
                     as you cannot fulfil your part of the agreement now. That must be entrusted to
                     better, or at least more honest men. You may go below, sir."</p>
                  <p>"I <emph>may</emph> go below. I <emph>will</emph> go of my own will, and death
                     is the portion of any one who tries to stop me." I cared but little whether I
                     killed Mr. Creighton himself or any man then on deck.</p>
                  <p>As I came to the companion way the groups about it gave way, in wholesome
                     respect to my pistol. Stooping to pick up a cutlass resting against it I
                     descended, and locking the state-room door threw myself upon the berth, and lay
                     "chewing the end of sweet and bitter fancies." The bright moonlight streamed in
                     through the open air port, and the sullen dash of the spray against the
                     felucca's side beat in solemn cadence to my own bitter despondent
                     reflections.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the Americans had gained the forecastle, a part of the others
                     immediately surrounded the scuttle, and the Nautch Girl changed hands.</p>

                     LIMITED.</head>
                  <p>After a short hour of feverish reflection, I concluded to take the matter as
                     philosophically as might be, and lit a cigar to assist in arriving at that
                     beatific state which I once heard a Chinaman describe as being the usual mental
                     condition of the officiating prelate of the "Josh House" where he performed his
                     devotions. "He too muchee good padre; he tinkee, he smokee, he smokee, he
                     tinkee. When ting he go somettime bad, he tink, belly well. When ting he go

                     cause no care dam."</p>
                  <p>It was not easy, however, to achieve that degree of stoicism with a bullet hole
                     in one's thigh, and a positive conviction of evil drawing nigh to one who,
                     whatever were her feelings toward me; was dear as life itself. For myself I had
                     but little apprehension, notwithstanding the seeming difficulties that had
                     sprung up around me in the last hour. I heard the tramp of the new firm of
                     Jeffers &amp; Co. as they paced the deck, devising the next steps in their plan
                     of villainy. Creighton was in his cabin, for I could hear his voice
                     occasionally, not yet modulated from the high pitch incident to the mental
                     excitement of the recent scene. In the waist the scuffling noise of the crew's
                     feet and their gutteral tones, as they talked over their individual exploits of
                     valor in getting roughly handled by a few unarmed men; but above all, that
                     tended to irritate and keep on fire my now fevered blood, were the tones of the
                     New York blackleg hero, as he uttered his mandates with a sharp, self important
                     inflection, and a decidedly nasal twang.</p>
                  <p>After long hours of prospective and retrospective meditation, I fell asleep,
                     and dreamed of the Susquehanna and my childhood. Being aroused by a knock at
                     the stateroom door, and the steward's voice asking admittance, I reached from
                     the berth and turned the bolt, not, however, before cocking the pistol that lay
                     in the berth where I had thrown it a few hours before. The breeze was fresher;
                     the vessel pitched somewhat, and occasional drops flew in at the open air
                     port.</p>
                  <p>"What is wanting, steward?"</p>
                  <p>The negro thrust his head into the doorway and said:</p>
                  <p>"I come for to tell you, sar, dat I has fixed you a hammock, sar; a swinging
                     cot, sar; man-o'-war cot, sar, in de country. De Captin Mucia<pb n="96"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000049" /> cia want dis state room, sar, whar de
                     chronometer and tings is, sar."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Mucia is welcome to this room if he wants it. Why can't I go into
                     one of the other two berths opposite?"</p>
                  <p>"De new officers has got dem, sar, de Spanish officers, sar."</p>
                  <p>The place he had denoted as my new quarters was an open space between the
                     bulkhead separating the after-cabin and the premises presided over by himself,
                     namely, the store room and pantry. A narrow passage led between these two rooms
                     into the forward cabin and cuddy. This space, which the steward had styled the
                     "country") a man of-war term for the open space between the two steerages), was
                     originally a washroom, but the late alterations in the cabin had cut it off to
                     be used as a spare stateroom, if necessary.</p>
                  <p>The others had eaten breakfast, and the steward placed some for me. After that
                     I came on deck, and stood in the waist watching the foam fly past the gray
                     sides of the felucca, surveying anon the new order of things around me. I
                     learned from the cook, who came to the waist to empty his galley tub, that the
                     Americans had announced their intention to remain quietly in the forecastle
                     during the remainder of the passage, and if there was any attempt to smoke them
                     out, or interfere with them in any way, they would "set fire to the bloody
                     hooker."</p>

                     off much of the morbid matter which otherwise would be thrown on the Lungs and
                     overburden and weaken them.</p>

                  <head>Why Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar cures so many diseases.</head>
                  <p>Every one knows that Tar is <emph>one of</emph> the most powerful modifiers of
                     the mucous membrane, and this membrane lines the Stomach, Intestines, Throat,
                     Lungs, Bladder, &amp;c. &amp;c. and it is its action upon this membrane which
                     gives "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" such great success, and gives it the prominent
                     place it now has in the world. "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" is a clear fluid,
                     divested of all foreign matter, rich in the medicinal properties of Tar,
                     pleasant to the taste, and endowed with efficacious properties. Try one
                     bottle.</p>
                  <p>A farmer living in Zell Township, four miles west of Boonsboro, Iowa, named.
                     Harrison McCloskey, contracted a severe cold early in the Spring of 1868. He
                     could get no relief—grew worse, spit blood, had severe pain in his side and
                     breast, night sweats, loss of appetite, and could do no work of any kind. He
                     was completely cured by the use of Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar, and has gained
                     twenty-five pounds in weight, no cough, good appetite, and able to do any
                     work.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman in West Cornwall, Conn. named Hamilton B. Howard, writes that he
                     has used Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar for Bronchitis, and <emph>it has entirely
                        cured him</emph>, although his family physician pronounced his case beyond
                     cure. A friend who knew the merit of Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar, prevailed on him
                     to try it, and he sends permission to publish his statement.</p>

                  <p>They also stipulated that they should be served regularly with meals, and a few
                     of their number permitted on deck at a time. Any molestation of these would
                     meet with speedy retaliation in the manner threatened and in these words,
                     "We'll all go to the bottom together." All now on board, from the merchant
                     down, stood in fear of this threat being executed, and acceded to these
                     demands. The Americans had, upon gaining the forecastle, armed themselves with
                     their krisses, which had been, as personal property, hidden about in their
                     berths and mattresses; but the pistols—supplied to them on the night of the
                     adventure with the bangkong, and which I had permitted them to retain—were now
                     nearly all missing. A few were produced, however, and with these they made a
                     show at the scuttle of being fully armed.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after Mucia proceeded to take the altitude of the sun, the forenoon
                     observation, for ascertaining the time at the chip, <choice>
                        <sic>and and</sic>
                        <corr>and</corr>
                     </choice> from it compute the longitude.</p>
                  <p>I noted him keenly. He showed his lack of experience in using the instrument,
                     simple as the operation is, and his hesitation and delay on reading off the
                     altitude on the quadrant told me half his story. Jeffers was at the chronometer
                     taking off the time, as he had done for me. At the conclusion of the
                     observations Mucia went below. The "sights" evidently did not suit the new
                     navigator, for he came up afterwards and repeated them.</p>
                  <p>"This vessel is going to get ashore," was my inward remark. Whoever this fellow
                     was, and by what means he became acknowledged as the accredited captain of a
                     vessel, he was but a tyro in the science of navigation, and had never, I felt
                     assured, had the responsibility of a vessel upon him before. I did not think
                     him of the right material or proper qualification even for a second or third
                     mate.</p>
                  <p>The first step, as I then thought, was to show Jeffers that he was an imposter,
                     then the refutation of his statements mitigating against me would easily
                     follow. The uselessness of any such attempt will be seen in the following
                     chapter.</p>

                  <p>At a little past noon the steward came to the door and said: You are wanted in
                     the cabin sir."</p>
                  <p>"Who wants me?" I asked, getting out of the cot where I had been endeavoring to
                     read myself to sleep with a very Frenchy sensation novel.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Creighton and Captain Mucia, sar. Dey is gwine to do something wid you
                     sar, I spect. You can take dis, sar; it's good for to have<pb n="98-99"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000051" /> two some time, sar," he said in a lower tone,
                     handing me a revolver loaded and capped.</p>
                  <p>"It is a very unseasonable time for any one to experiment with me," I said,
                     taking it. "I will go, however, for the want of something better to do." In
                     truth, I was in fine tune for almost anything in the shooting line.</p>
                  <p>I went on deck, and the steward led the way to the after-companion way,
                     saying:</p>
                  <p>"Walk down, sar."</p>
                  <p>There in solemn conclave sat Mr. Creighton, Mucia and Macao Joe. The apartment
                     was handsomely fitted up with a sort of compromise between the heavy upholstery
                     of Europe and the light, open furniture suitable in the tropics. A canvas
                     screen, ornamented with rich Chinese papering, divided this room from the
                     stateroom belonging to Mr. Creighton and his family. Behind this screen was
                     Miss Creighton, I felt positive. Macao Joe was seated uneasily upon the edge of
                     the transom cushion. Jeffers was before a table with some papers, like a stage
                     notary. The merchant was in an easy Manilla chair, with his back toward the
                     screen; and the "coming man" reclined, swelling with importance, on a sofa,
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vis-a-vis</foreign> to Creighton. As I came down he
                     was speaking of his inability to sleep from the "execrating pain from my
                     limb."</p>
                  <p>"I deplore the accident truly, and trust it will prove only of short duration,
                     and my servant, who is skilled in dressing wounds, shall attend to it regularly
                     during my sojourn on board."</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir," began Mucia, as I seated myself in the august presence of the
                     Putterrum "king," "I have sent for you, at Mr. Creighton's suggestion, to take
                     down your statements, and if they are suffish'ntly ac'rate, and there's no
                     trying to lie out of this thing, we will, or he will allow you a little show
                     for yourself, though I wouldn't give you—"</p>
                  <p>"Did Mr. Creighton or you send for me," I interrupted him, sternly.</p>
                  <p>"He sent for you, I didn't send for you."</p>
                  <p>"Then let him talk to me." I replied with scorn.</p>
                  <p>"Now, see here, young man, I aint quite done with you yet myself. It is only on
                     account of Mr. Creighton that I—"</p>
                  <p>"Enough of that now," I said; "proceed with your business."</p>
                  <p>"Well, the first thing that I want you to do is to give up that pistol."</p>
                  <p>"Yes; there is no occasion for you to retain fire arms," joined in the
                     merchant.</p>
                  <p>I handed him the one that had but three remaining charges, knowing that I could
                     get another if I chose from the steward, though one was enough.</p>
                  <p>"Now, sir," continued Creighton, "your antecedents are tolerably well known;
                     and a fine story it is truly—a fine career, indeed. But it does not signify at
                     present. I am going to make a report of this whole matter to the authorities at
                     Singapore; and if you choose to sign an acknowledgment of your criminality in
                     the matter, a full, unreserved avowal of your nefarious design upon my life and
                     the lives of those men who refused to join in your scheme, including also your
                     persistent ent opposition to my repeated commands, in firing into the Rajah's
                     cruiser"—here he blinked slightly as his eyes met mine, but continued
                     brazenly—"and, in short, if you choose to sign that document," placing his
                     hand, upon a paper before Jeffers, we will take upon ourselves the risk
                     attaching to your release, and put you and your miserable associates ashore
                     at-er-ah-at some point whence you can in time make your way back to your
                     friends, if you have any; and if this scrape prove a warning to you all to lead
                     a better life, the way is open to you at least once more. I am, in doing this
                     unheard act of clemency, yielding to er-ah-er influences which, though against
                     my better judgment, I have given way to from feelings which er-ah, which are
                     prompted by compassion for your extreme youth and outward evidences of better
                     things; your coolness and determination on a certain occasion (though I know
                     now what was the mainspring of it all), and the chance, the bare improbable
                     chance—that you may, under Providence, try for a better life. You are young, of
                     honest appearance, and with an intelligence that would make you a useful member
                     of society if directed in any honorable channel, instead of skulking along the
                     face of the universe, herding with vile adventurers, or seeking to entrap with
                     your honest countenance and plausible forgeries the confidence of mankind.</p>
                  <p>"You can go back to the woman you have married, or the one who is your lawful
                     wife—I suppose you have a dozen, good and bad—(here there was a grin
                     perceptible on Macao Joe's features, and a shrugging of Jeffers' shoulders,
                     while Mucia looked sternly around with an expression that was meant to say,
                     "There is nothing funny in the contemplation of such a character") "and try to
                     make her some amends for the misery you have caused her thus far. Now, if you
                     choose to sign this paper, which releases your show of title in the vessel, and
                     this one which contains the admissions that I have mentioned, you can go, and
                     joy go with you. I shan't sleep well till you are out of the ship."</p>
                  <p>There was a pause. Mucia was preparing to speak. I motioned to him to stop, and
                     he did so. The preposterousness of all, from first to last, that I had seen and
                     heard, began now to assume the character of a grand, melancholy and dangerous
                     joke. With a morbid and reckless indifference to the result, I determined to
                     lead on the farce to its conclusion, feeling secure in the belief that such a <choice>
                        <sic>mushroon</sic>
                        <corr>mushroom</corr>
                     </choice> growth of error and rascality combined could not long, even with my
                     own silence, keep itself from toppling over. An inclination to appear as if
                     entertaining the proposition prompted me to proceed in a very unnatural manner
                     under the circumstances, and I replied to the above heavy and somewhat
                     magisterial homily:</p>
                  <p>"I would like to take a short time to consider upon this, as it involves much
                     more than is apparent at the first glance. Let me read those papers."</p>
                  <p>Jeffers handed them. The first was an acknowledgment of my inability to perform
                     the agreement, ascribing as a reason an inability to maintain authority over
                     the crew, and enforce obedience to my orders; and concluded with a resignation
                     of the charge of the vessel on the high seas. The second was a
                        carefully-written<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6013-00000052" /> fully-written
                     instrument, containing, in proper, comprehensive forms of expression, all that
                     the merchant had specified, and ended with an acknowledgment that my name was
                     Julius Frazee, and that I had been a midshipman in the Indian Navy. and was
                     cashiered from that service for the committal of an act of extreme cruelty
                     while in charge of a small prize. I now saw that Van Horn's Manilla career was
                     to be imputed to me, as neither the merchant nor Jeffers was acquainted with
                     that portion of his history, nor the above <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                        >alias</foreign>.</p>
                  <p>"So my name is Julius Frazee, is it?" I answered slowly. "It is desirable
                     always to know these little points, to avoid the danger of misapprehension at
                     any time."</p>
                  <p>The merchant looked somewhat surprised at my tone, and uttered the words,
                     "Wonderful, wonderful."</p>
                  <p>"There is a good deal involved in signing this paper."</p>
                  <p>Creighton and Mucia exchanged glances, the latter saying, "Oh, he's keen
                     enough, sir, I'll warrant you."</p>
                  <p>"Who drafted this extraordinary document? I see the writing is Jeffers', but
                     who was the author of this wonderful paper?"</p>
                  <p>"I dictated it, sir, from ample and satisfactory information and data which I
                     have," said the merchant.</p>
                  <p>"You have not included the wives and false marriages. I would like that to go
                     in, so as to feel assured that I am the right person, and not somebody
                     else."</p>
                  <p>"If you think this is an <choice>
                        <sic>accasion</sic>
                        <corr>occasion</corr>
                     </choice> for trifling and sport, sir, you make a grand mistake, I assure you a
                     grand mistake. A word more, sir, and I withdraw the opportunity offered."</p>
                  <p>I knew that a positive refusal to sign would terminate the audience, thus
                     depriving me of the opportunity of further investigation, in the course of
                     which I hoped to arouse the merchant's suspicions to the nature of the trap he
                     was falling into. Not that I cared anything for his own security now, after the
                     utter mulishness and distrust of me evinced from the beginning; nor was the
                     loss of the Nautch Girl the motive actuating me. I felt that after the
                     engagement with the steamer I should be in somewhat the position of him who
                     drew the elephant, with that vessel on my hands.</p>
                  <p>"I must feel my way in this matter," I said, "Permit me to ask one
                     question."</p>
                  <p>"I am not here, sir, to waste time in answering idle questions only to prolong
                     and seek some opportunity for—for—I don't know what; for you have nothing to
                     hope from me whatever, if you decline to sign. It's time I was taking my nap,"
                     answered the merchant sharply.</p>
                  <p>"One word. Admitting that I am Julius Frazee, that I have married a dozen
                     women, more or less, and committed all sorts of enormities too various to
                     mention, what evidence have you that I contemplated any violence whatever on
                     board this vessel? What evidence other than the bare statement of an utter
                     stranger to us all, and his miserable associates, together with your own
                     terrified suspicions?"</p>
                  <p>"Young man, there is no earthly use for you to attempt to turn fool in this
                     way. It won't avail you a single point—not a single point. To show you now the
                     uselessness of it, those men," pointing to Jeffers and Macao Joe, "have been
                     throwing dust in your eyes ever since your first hint of the matter. They
                     waited till you had fully committed yourself before a word was spoken to
                     me."</p>
                  <p>"And what do they depose?"</p>
                  <p>"They depose all, the whole of your infernal plan to take my money. It's not
                     much, it's true," he added parenthetically, with the craft of a deep old
                     gentleman, "but it was enough to tempt the cupidity of your rascals, who, I
                     think sometimes, concocted the thing and forced you into it. But I don't know,
                     perhaps they are the most innocent themselves."</p>
                  <p>"No, they did not force me into it."</p>
                  <p>"They didn't, eh. You admit, then, that you was the getter up of the
                     enterprise."</p>
                  <p>No, I don't admit that. I only admit that they did not get it up."</p>
                  <p>"You won't make anything by spending your breath with him, sir," struck in
                     Mucia, beginning to grow, I thought, a little uneasy.</p>
                  <p>"No, of course not; but he assures me positively, and if it was anything of

                     </choice> it would be quite funny," said Creighton.</p>
                  <p>"I don't think that this will be at all funny by the time you get further into
                     it," I replied, glancing sideways at Mucia, whose eyes trembled an instant, and
                     then resumed their wonted composed expression.</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir, what are you going to do? Say quick!" asked the merchant.</p>
                  <p>"What is the alternative of refusing?"</p>
                  <p>"You go in irons," said Mucia.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Jeffers," said I, turning to that individual, "you assert, I suppose, that
                     I made overtures to you with a view of getting your co-operation to take the
                     money? What else were we to do; of course there was something else
                     planned?"</p>
                  <p>"You and I were to cast lots for Miss Creighton."</p>
                  <p>"The rascal!" exclaimed Creighton, with his teeth shut hard.</p>
                  <p>"Go on."</p>
                  <p>"And the Ayah was to be retained, but Mr. Creighton and his servant were to be
                     put ashore on a small, uninhabited rock, with a supply of food, which was to be
                     poisoned. The coffee was to be poisoned."</p>
                  <p>"Drive ahead! it is interesting," I said.</p>
                  <p>"You were to take the vessel down to Temple Island, where we would lie in wait
                     for the traders, bound up on the <choice>

                     </choice>."</p>
                  <p>"Isn't that old story most worn out—taking a ship and turning her into a
                     pirate? It is in every dogwatch yarn." I asked, cooly.</p>
                  <p>"I think it is myself." he said.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, indeed," I continued, "Why did you not have it that you would claim the
                     girl, Mucia thinking to cut you out of her; and after selling the vessel and
                     dividing the spoils, leave—he for New York and you for London, as you both
                     think to do after you get me out of the way."</p>
                  <p>"I don't know as we are called upon to listen to any more of his stuff," said
                     Jeffers, this time to hide some little astonishment.</p>
                  <p>I had hit then a central spot, and put a flea in the ear of Jeffers, in
                     referring to the "cutting out by Mucia.</p>
                  <p>"Enough of this, sir," broke in Mucia; "if you think, that we are not inclined
                     to face you with the charges, I will show you. I first<pb n="102-103"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000053" /> heard you mentioned among my men, they having
                     seen you before. Then I heard the cabin boy of this vessel say he'd seen you at
                     Manilla, and then, I found that I saw you at Manilla myself, in the chain gang.
                     I know all about you; and my men know you, and the cabin-boy's mother lives
                     next door to one of your wives, out toward the factories. All your doings are
                     plain enough. When I overheard you speakin' to one of my men in a confidential
                     sort of way, I thought something was up, and watched you; It is all known. You
                     had been among my men, feelin' your way, and you had half of the Malays into
                     it, but they got scared and came and blowed on the whole thing. So it's no use
                     fifing any more."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Macao Joe what do you say?"</p>
                  <p>"I say you no fool, but you been fool dis time, dat what I say
                     Yank—Yank—Yank."</p>
                  <p>"Tell us your story. I want no one to come to me after I explode this thing,
                     and pretend that they were working on my behalf secretly. I want you to commit
                     yourself."</p>
                  <p>There was a decided uneasiness evident in the trio, and some surprise-evident
                     in the merchant's face. The first mentioned, however, felt so secure in their
                     strength that they did not much fear anything I could say.</p>
                  <p>"My story is all same as todder. You come talkee to me; way back yonna at de
                     island. You say, Joe, what for you an' me live like dog for all time. You say,

                  <p>"You have said enough; I have you on record," I said quietly. At this time a
                     faint glimmer—the faintest glimmer imaginable—of common sense was beginning to
                     dawn upon Mr. Creighton's mind.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXVIII—MR. CREIGHTON IS ENLIGHTENED.</head>
                  <p>"I retract my clemency." said Mr. Creighton. "I am done with sentiment. To
                     Singapore prison you go; and if money, the persistent and lavish expenditure of
                     money will secure you a felon's doom, you shall have it. Some beings are born
                     with crime and sin in their very soul, in every drop of blood; and you are such
                     a one, and any mistaken temporizing with such a creature would be criminal in
                     the sight of God and man. Now, sir, you can go to your stateroom, and if you
                     show yourself while I or my daughter are on deck, you shall be bucked and
                     gagged for the remainder of the passage."</p>
                  <p>He breathed hard. The glimmer of wrath and execration showed plainly in his
                     gray eyes as he glared at me. I returned it, I believe, without the quiver of a
                     muscle, and seeing now that further opportunity for getting the slightest hold
                     upon his confidence was over, I felt that my duty to him and his daughter could
                     be performed, for the present ent, at least, after putting in operation an
                     expedient that I had hit upon a little time before. Looking him calmly in the
                     face, I said:</p>
                  <p>"Give me some paper; I am going to make a clean breast of something."</p>
                  <p>All eyes were immediately fastened upon me as I took a pencil from my pocket
                     and wrote: <q>
                        <p>"You are most miserably fooled. Notice the three. They are disappointed
                           at the prospect of my still remaining on board. Jeffers loves your
                           daughter, and baffled by your refusing to take him with you to England,
                           has concocted this scheme to get me out of the way and secure what he
                           desires. I love your daughter, and she loves me. This explains why I have
                           thus far borne this much. I am not Julius Frazee, but know him well. He
                           is my double, and was at Manilla, and it is him the cabin boy has seen.
                           This is not the first time I have been taken for him. He has been with
                           you at Putterrum. You and your daughter know him. His name is Van Horn: I
                           am positive that Mucia is not the name of the person present. I will show
                           you that presently. He never was a shipmaster in his life. He is a New
                           York impostor. He is no navigator, but has only a smattering of the
                           acquirement. He never was at Manilla. Now heed my last injunction, on it
                           depends much. I am going to admit their lies. Mark how it will surprise
                           them:"</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Creighton read and re-read these hurriedly written sentences, and, after a
                     scrutinizing glance at all present, his gaze rested on me again, his
                     countenance clothed with alternate expressions of bewilderment and distrust.
                     There was the most intense interest manifested on the part of the others, but
                     none spoke. After a pause, during which he seemed intently reflecting upon
                     something, he said in a somewhat changed tone:</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir, we will hear your confession."</p>
                  <p>I proceeded, looking at nothing, apparently.</p>
                  <p>"I shall now confess the whole truth. I did attempt to tamper with Mr. Jeffers
                     and Macao Joe, and thought they were going to join me in the murder of yourself
                     and others. They affected to hate you and desired a portion of the money. I see
                     I have been miserably deceived, and have no more to say."</p>
                  <p>A rapid glance around showed the trio staring at each other.—Bewilderment was
                     the dominant expression of all. Creighton leaning forward in his chair, with a
                     slight stammer asked:</p>
                  <p>"Who are you, any way?"</p>
                  <p>"Julius Frazee," I returned. "You are misinformed; I never really married but
                     two women, and one of them is since dead."</p>
                  <p>I uttered this falsehood with the same intention that I did the previous one,
                     but as I finished speaking I heard a movement behind the screen and a low sob.
                     Instantly a stateroom door was softly shut, and the effect of my own words
                     smote upon my heart with a sensation I never felt before. What would I not have
                     given to have unsaid those words! My impatience to do something, not clearly
                     knowing what, was so tormenting that I was upon the point of rushing to my
                     quarters, and retracting my words thro'<pb n="104-105"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000054" /> the bulkhead air port, when Mucia regaining his
                     usual manner, said:</p>
                  <p>"Hadn't we better tumble him ashore at the nearest island, and be done with
                     him, sir?"</p>
                  <p>That was a very unfortunate remark for him, and did more to fasten the new
                     arisen suspicion in the merchant's mind than anything I could have said. He was
                     now somewhat aware of the possibility only of what I had <choice>
                        <sic>writen</sic>
                        <corr>written</corr>
                     </choice> being true, for he still was disposed to regard me as working with a
                     subtle mind to gain command of the vessel for sinister purposes. Taking a piece
                     of paper he wrote, saying as he did so to the others, to mislead them:</p>
                  <p>"There are some things, gentlemen, that are sacred even to the lowest
                     criminal."</p>
                  <p>I shall always believe that the glance which Mucia and Jeffers exchanged at
                     that remark, if truly interpreted, would have read:</p>
                  <p>"We have made a mistake; we might have had him with us. It is not too late,
                     yet."</p>
                  <p>The merchant handed me what he had written. It was:</p>
                  <p>"Prove to me that this man is an impostor."</p>
                  <p>I was proceeding to write again, when Jeffers arose and said:</p>
                  <p>"We will retire, and return at your pleasure."</p>
                  <p>They were evidently anxious to confer upon what had occurred. As Jeffers passed
                     me I looked hard into his eyes, and gave him a knowing fraternal wink, which he
                     appeared to appreciate, though it surprised him slightly. After they had
                     retired, I said:</p>
                  <p>"It is a trifle, but is sufficient as far as it goes. He does not spell the
                     name right, which is Murcia."</p>
                  <p>"That does not prove anything. He may have adopted that change, or his father
                     before him."</p>
                  <p>"But the papers," I interrupted him, of the vessel contain the name spelled
                     with an '<hi rend="i"/>r.' He showed them to me as credentials, and though I
                     glanced briefly at them the form of the name is still in my mind, but the
                     discrepancy never occurred to me till the afternoon."</p>
                  <p>"How will you establish it," he asked.</p>
                  <p>"Get him to write his name several times, and then, to avoid suspicion, make
                     some excuse to look at his papers. You only wish to convince yourself. You
                     might casually call his attention to the mistake as a mistake, and watch his
                     expression but be careful not to excite his fears that you mistrust him."</p>
                  <p>It was one of those mistakes in the spelling of words familiar to all, but it
                     probably never happens in a person's real name. My impression was this, that
                     when the self styled Mucia first came in possession of the papers, or when he
                     conceived the idea of palming himself off as the Captain Murcia denoted in
                     them, he glanced at the name, and not being a man of much clerkly experience,
                     probably he mistook the spelling of the rapid custom-house hand at first, and
                     it remained fixed in his mind.</p>
                  <p>The name occurred elsewhere more plainly written, but he had got the letters
                     already fixed, and his attention never settling especially upon that point, it
                     went uncorrected. The idea of a captain having his name misspelled all through
                     his vessel's papers, is, to a person familiar with such things, absurd.</p>
                  <p>He requested me to call the others down again after this point and others
                     connected with the subject had been discussed. A great change had taken place
                     in his view of the matter, though he was far from being convinced of my single
                     mindedness even yet. Another subject upon which he was evidently pondering was
                     my very candid avowal concerning his daughter, and the equally ly conceited
                     claim to her reciprocation of my affections. Those statements were merely the
                     impulsive expression of the relations that I believed existed, but were written
                     to serve a definite purpose. In that short missive I grouped together the most
                     striking facts relevant to the occasion, with the sole object of starting him

                     entertaining and acting upon the last injunction, relative to the confession.
                     Had this failed, the opportunity of giving him the aid of myself and men in
                     season to be of any avail would have been lost forever.</p>
                  <p>When the conspirators came down again, I observed that they cast a friendly eye
                     toward me as they seated themselves.</p>
                  <p>"I have concluded," observed Creighton, "from what I have learned, to leave
                     this person to the companionship of his own doings. He can do no more harm if
                     kept under casual notice, and he can depart at Singapore without hindrance from
                     me. It was my intention to have handed him over to the law, but upon reflection
                     there can not be proved against him any crime which I <emph>now</emph> take
                     special interest in having punished. A part of his confession you have heard,
                     but some of the statements which he has made to me are such as will lead to the
                     conviction of parties whom. I am exceedingly anxious to have punished, and
                     certain circumstances suggest that the course that I have marked out will be
                     perhaps the best upon the whole. But I want to have down one or two of his
                     gang, and ascertain, if possible, from examination of them how far this person
                     has deviated from the truth in certain of his revelations to me. You can go,
                     sir."</p>
                  <p>I departed, feeling now satisfied that the merchant was awake at last to the
                     snare set for him, and now depended upon me and the men in the forecastle to
                     extricate him. It was not a moment too soon, for with address and moderate
                     luck, all might yet be well, but it was of the utmost importance that Jeffers
                     and his associates remain utterly deceived regarding the merchant's discovery
                     of their machinations. It was with this in view that he uttered the last well
                     invented remarks.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XXIX—WHAT THEY WANTED</head>
                  <p>I went to my cot and, lighting my cigar, endeavored to arrange some practicable
                     course of procedure, but nothing presented itself to my mind as at all
                     feasible. We were now completely at the mercy of as unprincipled a set of
                     wretches as ever drew a kreese, and without some successful stratagem I could
                     not hope to recover the command of the felucca. To devise a suitable plan of
                     action seemed utterly beyond my power. My usual fertility of expedients had
                     apparently deserted me. It was not at all probable that the three villains
                     entertained the thought of dividing the money, large though she sum might be,
                     among the number of scoundrels whom they controlled. It was, therefore, safe to
                     conclude that there was a plot within a plot.</p>
                  <p>Again, I was morally certain that both Jeffers and Mucia each looked upon the
                     possession of the merchant's daughter as an individual right, and my remark a
                     short time since had caused them to consider, each for himself, that subject.
                        Thus<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6013-00000055" /> far, and no farther could I
                     see the way out of the present almost hopeless entanglement. In reflecting upon
                     the probable intentions of the two men—Jeffers and Mucia—I could arrive at but
                     one conclusion, namely, that each sought to <emph>marry</emph> Miss Creighton.
                     The course contemplated by them, however, it might strike the mind at first as
                     being Quixotic and foolish, was nevertheless, upon closer scrutiny, evidently
                     feasible and easy if pursued with a desperate persistance and determination.
                     And either of them was capable of anything.</p>
                  <p>A beautiful young woman alone in the midst of a horde of miscreants like those
                     on board, and borne to some out of the way haunt, such as they would repair to,
                     would find herself so entirely helpless that the necessity of the protection of
                     some one of them would pave the way to consequences which she would be forced
                     finally to accept. The present means which the large sum on board would afford,
                     and the prospect of eventually reaching all or a portion of the remainder,
                     through the usual way of heirship, together with the probability of sooner
                     arriving at a settlement and reconciliation, by the strong ties of parental
                     affection, formed doubtless the attractive prospect which presented it self to
                     the mental vision of the two men, who sought to make use of each other in
                     attaining this end.</p>
                  <p>That Jeffers had long entertained an ardent affection for this young girl, and
                     stood in the relation of a brother to her during her childhood, which relation
                     grew at last to a deep rooted passion, was also plain from what had been
                     revealed incidentally.</p>
                  <p>The sum total of the other's motive of possession, aside from the mercenary
                     one, was but the sensual longing of a vile, vulgar voluptuary.</p>
                  <p>I had been below but a short time before I was again sent for by the merchant,
                     who, without giving any satisfactory reason, obtained my promise not to
                     acquaint his daughter with any facts relating to myself or to our situation, at
                     least for the present. I was exceeding loth to grant such promise, but deferred
                     to his wishes in that respect, knowing that the impending trouble would, all
                     too soon, disclose itself to her. I also guessed at the shrewd motive that
                     prompted him to bind me with this promise, and concluded that notwithstanding
                     his sagacity in other matters he had a very limited conception of a woman's
                     nature, and especially that of his own child. In conclusion, he requested that
                     I would send the most trusty and prudent of my men, as all efforts to induce
                     them to come into the cabin had been unavailing.</p>
                  <p>I went to the scuttle, and called Kitler. A number of gratified faces met my
                     view, in looking down into the forecastle. Anxious inquiries after my general
                     health and future prospects were plentiful. I saw with regret and rising
                     indignation, their bruised and cut features, which had been as yet uncared for.
                     My own wound was still undressed, and pained me no little, but I determined to
                     provide them with suitable dressings, and looked after them personally, if
                     permitted. Permission was accorded after some delay, and the<choice>

                     their hearty, off-hand style, that they were still undaunted, and could be

                  <p>"Hillo, Doc," hailed one, "do they let you run about loose?"</p>
                  <p>"I've heard you got a bullet bite; whereabouts was it?" said another.</p>
                  <p>"Them fellers have been here to get some of us down in the cabin, but their

                  <p>"What has pisened that old yellow sinner agin us all so allmighty suddent,

                     this bust up. I can't get no head nor tail to it. Dick Dailey sez he's seen
                     that captain around New York with them Howard Street thieves, and after that he
                     was one of the jewelry swindlin' fellers with envelopes and numbers in 'em.

                  <p>"Where is Dailey?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"He's asleep there. Sam wake him up; this ain't no time to sleep, with the
                     inimy around us. He sat up with Seeley all night," said the speaker, addressing
                     me.</p>
                  <p>"Hillo, Doc, I thought you was dead, I did, by smoke! I seed you sorter gin out
                     and look desolate like, and I knowed you was hit. I felt like I ort to a
                     stopped, then I seed that wouldn't do," said Dailey, as he came under the
                     scuttle.</p>
                  <p>"Dailey," I asked, "do you know this fellow, calling himself Mucia?"</p>
                  <p>"Mucia! That ain't his name. I knowed him when he was a roperin, a capper for a

                     say so, Jake?"</p>
                  <p>"What is his name?" I inquired.</p>
                  <p>"He is know'd mostly in York by the name of Tit, Jack Tit. You ask him if he
                     knows Bill Peterson."</p>
                  <p>"Well, never mind, now, I only wanted to know his name."</p>
                  <p>"He hove a stove plate at him, and cut his ear. I'll bet you'll see a scar now
                     on his ear, one car. I'll bet you the drinks for all hands, and I havn't saw
                     his ear in my life."</p>
                  <p>"Kitler," I said, "Mr. Creighton wants to see you; you can go in the cabin
                     without fear of trouble or detention."</p>
                  <p>"What's up, capting?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"He wants to ask you some questions," I said, and walked away.</p>
                  <p>After providing them with a few articles from the medicine chest, and attending
                     to the most serious of the wounds, I left them in readiness for an opportunity

                  <p>Some persons insist that a remedy can not with dignity be advertised, Very
                     strange, indeed. We have a medicine prepared under the direction of a regular
                     physician of extensive practice. It is a want in the community—benefits and
                     blessings following its use. Shall it be placed to the disposal of the
                     public—or its good effects confined to a few?</p>
                  <p>We know some persons have advertised worthless medicines, but a practical test
                     causes all such to soon disappear from the public notice, while those with

                  <p>If he had feared any further outbreak, resulting from my visits to the
                     forecastle, why did he not direct some of his men to attend me? The truth was
                     that both he and Jeffers felt assured of my co-operation, and they intended to
                     make use of me in the furtherance of their villainy.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXX—THE COUNTERPLOT BEGINS.</head>
                  <p>A few hours later, Jeffers, taking the opportunity when I stood apart from any
                     one, approached and said:</p>
                  <p>"If we had known that you were all right there would have been no trouble. I
                     intended to sound you, and did commence, but you remember we was interrupted. I
                     intended to see you again, on deck, but Mucia brought things to a head sooner
                     than I expected."</p>
                  <p>"It was a shabby trick, I thought," I answered moodily.</p>
                  <p>"He could not believe," continued Jeffers, "that you would come in, and was
                     opposed to my running any risk about it; but I think he did not want to divide
                     the money among too many. Now for my part, I think that the bullion will divide
                     handsomely among four, and we can easily bamboozle the men as to the amount; a
                     small amount will go a great ways with those poor devils, who can live on a few
                     pice a day. They think now that the sum is only a tenth of what it is; so that
                     is all provided for."</p>
                  <p>Mucia's dog instincts, it seemed, had taught him that I was not of the right
                     material for the business.—Again my prescience had proved correct in relation
                     to the division of the gold. One thing more was to be ascertained, for I now
                     began to see my way out of the dangers that drew nigh. There was,
                     notwithstanding the valiant eagerness of "Gideon's Band," but slight hope of
                     overcoming the fearful odds arrayed against us. The achievement of brilliant
                     victories in the face of vastly superior numbers is all entertaining and proper
                     enough in the melodramas and romances, and not unfrequently is actually
                     exemplified in military operations. But those familiar with hand-to-hand
                     combats on shipboard will perceive that the likelihood of succeeding against
                     Mucia and Jeffers in a square pitched battle was indeed a very forlorn hope,
                     under all the circumstances. With the outlines of a plan of action which would
                     afford a reasonable probability of success in my mind, I proceeded to lead on
                     Jeffers.</p>
                  <p>"All that is very well, but there is one obstacle which I don't see how to
                     remove practicably."</p>
                  <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6013-00000057" />
                  <p>"What is that?" asked Jeffers.</p>
                  <p>"The daughter," I replied. "I don't know why it is, but I don't like to have
                     any hand in putting her out of the way; I don't want to know even when it is
                     going on. Now, as for old Creighton, I shall deal with him myself. I shall
                     claim it as a right, but the girl must be got rid of somehow, that is evident,
                     for she would be a dangerous person to be adrift, smart as she is."</p>
                  <p>Jeffers did not disguise the satisfaction that he felt at the exhibition of so
                     much moral turpitude as my words betrayed, and hastened to reply.</p>
                  <p>"Oh there is no danger of that. She will be taken care of. You need not fear.
                     We want to manage this little affair without the loss of a single life of any
                     importance. We want to do it without violence, except what may possibly occur
                     at the dispersion. You see the plan is to so proceed that if at any time
                     afterward the thing should be brought up in court, there would be a good
                     chance, with plenty of money, to strain it around into a common row on
                     shipboard, all hands drunk and the money stolen. Don't you see but for that we
                     might go ahead right now, and tell old Creighton that we wanted his money, and
                     put him ashore and go down to a certain place and get all hands drunk on shore,
                     and with just enough to man the vessel, put away for elsewhere?"</p>
                  <p>"And Miss Creighton?" I said inquiringly.</p>
                  <p>"I'll take charge of her. She won't pester any body, I'll fix that if I'm not
                     interfered with, and I hope I wont be, though there's a chance." He was
                     thinking of Mucia and my remark in the cabin, as he paused, and looked as if
                     contemplating a confidential disclosure. I suppose he concluded to approach the
                     subject in a more roundabout manner, for he at last asked:</p>
                  <p>"What was your motive in acknowledging our fictions as true, in the cabin? That
                     has scared Mucia. He was for having you accidentally fall overboard to
                     night."</p>
                  <p>This last was no doubt true, but Jeffers mentioned it to increase my natural
                     ill feeling toward that person.</p>
                  <p>I knew that the motive which I gave actuating me to commit that, to them,
                     inexplicable act, must be plausible and bear the impress of truth upon it to
                     allay Mucia's suspicion, or prevent any from arising in the mind of Jeffers. I
                     declined. therefore, giving an explanation just then, telling him I would clear
                     it up at another time, and hinted that I was a comrade of Van Horn's, and that
                     we operated in company.</p>
                  <p>"But how will you get rid of Miss Creighton?" I concluded.</p>
                  <p>"There is but one safe way," he replied, "and my chance of managing it is
                     better than any one else's."</p>
                  <p>"How is that?"</p>
                  <p>"By marrying her," and he noted the effect of his word upon me.</p>
                  <p>"Well, if you can bring about a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">bona fide</foreign>
                     marriage, it would do better than putting her out of the way," I replied,
                     feeling how monstrous was the falsehood I uttered, for it would be far better
                     for her future hopes if she went to rest now than to be linked to this
                     debauched and now utterly abandoned man. "But it must be a genuine marriage," I
                     continued. No sham would he safe," for I am experienced in these sort of
                     things. Nothing but keeping her a respectable woman will prevent her blowing on
                     us all when you and she had a flare up, which would be probably the first time
                     you got drunk."</p>
                  <p>"You have the correct view of the matter," answered he, gratified at my ready
                     concurrence. "And she must either marry some one of us four, or—be put out of
                     the way. The last is shocking to us both. Whom will she marry with the best
                     grace and the least trouble? is now the question. Macao Joe? that's idle. You
                     have already enough," and we both smiled, though with far different thoughts.
                     "Mucia and myself are the only two available candidates for matrimony," he
                     proceeded. "He may, for all we know, have a lawful wife already. In that case
                     what would be Fannie's course when she discovered it? It is not necessary to
                     tell you what a woman like her could and would do under such circumstances.
                     It's very evident. Now, again, whoever under-takes to marry her must not be
                     interfered with by the others. Any girl would hold off and play one against the
                     other, till she saw an opportunity of escaping, and then we all would have to
                     stand from under. I assure you, I know her well. Now then, no time must be
                     wasted, after we commence, which must be soon. She must see that she is
                     entirely without protection, save from the one offering it to her; and with a
                     priest ready, I don't see as there is any special criminality in it at all."
                     And he glanced around, evidently not liking somehow to meet my gaze.</p>
                  <p>"No, it is a perfectly straightforward transaction, in my view," I replied.</p>
                  <p>"There is another point," he said slowly. "It wouldn't do to kill old
                     Creighton. He's old; he'll soon die, and then whoever has Fannie will see that
                     the rest don't suffer," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>"What will you do with him? It's a delicate matter to manage. How will you keep
                     on any sort of terms with the daughter, while her father's fate is unknown, or
                     threatening?"</p>
                  <p>"That is the very point I wish to arrive at with you. This business must be
                     handled without gloves, you understand; and, mark you, there must be no
                     interference whatever, from first to last, by any one. This condition is
                     imperative for the safety of all. When we commence I will candidly tell
                     Creighton that I want to marry his daughter. He will see where he is, and may
                     give his consent, though that last is doubtful. I will explain to him just what
                     is before her without mincing it. If she does not comply, and if he still
                     remains obstinate, we'll go down to a certain place that Macao Joe knows, and
                     lie at anchor there for weeks. There's accommodations on shore, and it's a fine
                     place. Plenty of fruit and water, and everything, and is not inhabited. It will
                     be strange if I don't manage it there. I can do it; it's all here," he said,
                     tapping his forehead. "I know Fannie, and the confidence she reposes in me is
                     half the battle."</p>
                  <p>"But will not that confidence be somewhat impaired," I said, in a quiet tone of
                     dryness, "when you appear before her in the character of abductor and plunderer
                     of her father's money?"</p>
                  <p>"I can manage all that," he said; "you have only to give in your co-operation,
                     and all will come right. In the first blush of the proceedings I shall take the
                     character of Mucia's dupe—that is, if he will agree to it—and as such it can be
                     managed by a plan that I have here, and he again tapped his forehead, while his
                     gray eyes glistened with a sinister determination.</p>
                  <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6013-00000058" />
                  <p>"You'll keep Creighton, of course, safe?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"By all means, we'll try it all ways—with him safe, with him threatened, with
                     him in immediate imminent peril, and lastly with him"—he paused and caught my
                     eye and finished—"out of the way. That will work out right, I know."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXXI.—A CONVERSATION WITH JEFFERS.</head>
                  <p>"Nice young men for an evening party," was my mental reflection at the time, I
                     thought he must have meditated something of this character long before our
                     departure from Putterrum. But such proved not the case; for a conference with
                     the merchant at Putterrum a few days before we left, disabused his mind of his
                     error in interpreting his employer's first words, and dispelled his hopes
                     forever. He had deluded himself with the belief that Creighton intended, at
                     some period not far distant, to sanction and approve, and even to bring about
                     his marriage with Miss Creighton. Nor was he without plausible grounds for
                     supposing that the merchant would prefer him for the husband of his daughter to
                     any other man, considering the confidences that had existed between them during
                     the previous years of hazardous but successful commercial intrigue. These
                     hopes, which had their origin in the misinterpretation of Mr. Creighton's words
                     twelve months before, were rudely brushed away by the proposition to furnish
                     Jeffers with a quarterly sum of money, on the condition that he would not visit
                     England until after his death. He perceived then, the hallucination under which
                     he had so long labored, and it is very probable that the shock, for it was
                     indeed a shock, falling so suddenly, completely prostrated and paralysed his
                     whole moral nature for the time. Chance threw in his way a creature in whom he,
                     with his penetration, perceived a fitting tool, if properly managed. The time
                     before him admitted of no course of action but that desperate and criminal one
                     which he chose. Once committed to the attainment of the merchant's daughter by
                     these hastily conceived and exceedingly reckless measures, he cut loose from
                     all moral ties, and abandoned himself to the approval of any means that would
                     further the end. Not looking beyond the difficulties presented to his immediate
                     view, he entirely lost sight of the thousand and one chances that were against
                     him to prevent the final successful settlement of this outrage, after the
                     high-handed criminality contemplated had placed him within the pale of
                     felony.</p>
                  <p>I appeared to be reflecting a moment, and then brought forward the first point
                     of my plan to entrap the black enterprise as soon as it announced itself; for
                     the mere announcement only was requisite, as they had possession of the vessel
                     already, and now that I had apparently joined them there was no motive for
                     further delay.</p>
                  <p>"Do you guess what Mucia secretly contemplates?" I asked, looking him squarely
                     in the eyes, with the air of one in possession of another secret.</p>
                  <p>"Well, I hardly think he has any design beyond getting the money, and perhaps
                     sharing in—in—"</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw," I interrupted.</p>
                  <p>"What then?" he asked with great interest.</p>
                  <p>"Mucia contemplates making himself a cheap hero. This class have that weakness.
                     It is a sort of disease, rather, that has its origin from reading sensation
                     newspapers and a longing to live comfortably without working. It is frightfully
                     epidemic in my country just at this time, and may also be elsewhere. In short,
                     Mucia does not intend to take the money at all. He wants to pursue a safer
                     course. His will is good enough, but he lacks the nerve, Gentry of his stripe
                     like their ease too well to endanger it by acts which would render them
                     amenable to the law. Mucia has not the hardihood to face the prospect of a long
                     imprisonment and hard fare. He thinks it would kill him."</p>
                  <p>"Go on," said Jeffers.</p>
                  <p>"Mucia wants to be the leading spirit of the hour with you and the men, and
                     while appearing to go with you, he will secretly assure Mr. Creighton that he
                     will extricate him by strategy; for example, drug the men's coffee with
                     laudanum and other narcotics from the medicine chest (for I don't think there
                     is laudanum enough quite on board to get this whole band to sleep), or by some
                     trickery, perhaps running away from the rendezvous. What would prevent him from
                     running the vessel into Singapore, or some large port? He is not much of a
                     navigator, but he might find it. You and Macao Joe know nothing of navigation,
                     and when he made the landfall of Singapore, for instance, it would be too late,
                     for it would be the easiest thing to come to anchor among the islands, make
                     some pretext for sending a cutter in by a prahu, and then what a fine <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">coup de theatre</foreign> it would be for a launch and two or
                     three cutters from Her Majesty's steam corvette 'Boomering' to dash alongside,
                     young Lord Cocquerell commanding, his lordship himself in the boarding party?
                     How glorious would be the effect when in the darkness they dashed alongside!
                     The honest, clean-looking blue jackets, cutlass in hand, and headed by their
                     brass-buttoned officer, driving your dirty barbarians down in the hold! How
                     glorious in the lantern light would appear the spectacle of you being accused
                     by Mucia of the whole plot, in the presence of Creighton and Miss Fannie,
                     before the honorable officers and the middies giving way to astonishment at the
                     rehearsal of the whole thing by Mucia! Then the sharp interrogation by his
                     lordship, ending with the order "put him in irons." I presume that he hopes for
                     the final culmination, in wedding cards and marriage settlements, <foreign

                     anything else, and I know that I could do it if so placed."</p>
                  <p>This little picture made a strong impression upon Jeffers, and he replied:</p>
                  <p>"That might have been done, but could not be now."</p>
                  <p>"I could do it, even now, were I in his place," I replied. He was rather
                     incredulous.</p>
                  <p>"Not in that particular manner, perhaps," I added; "but the person who sails
                     the vessel, the others not being navigators, holds them in the hollow of his
                     hand, unless he has committed himself by direct act of violence, and even that
                     might be got over if it was not too flagrant."</p>
                  <p>"What are your reasons for thinking that he holds any such intentions?"</p>
                  <p>"I know the man as well as if I had sailed with him for years. His name, to
                     begin with, is not Mucia; he has made a mistake in spelling it. You can satisfy
                     yourself of that by examining the papers belonging to the vessel he pretends to
                     have commanded. His name is Tit that is one of his <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                        >aliases</foreign>. One of my men<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6013-00000059" />
                     knows him. And the best evidence of his calibre lies in the fact that he is a
                     low-lived taker-in of greenhorns, and has been practising that business in New
                     York city. If you think that a person of that stamp is a regular 'out and
                     outer,' with stomach for the clean thing, it shows that you do not know your
                     man. Suffer me to know something of my own countrymen, good and bad. I should
                     not want him in any business of this sort with me, unless he dips right in deep
                     at the start, and leaves no hole to creep out of in time to come."</p>
                  <p>What I had uttered thus far in relation to Mucia I believed to be true. That it
                     was Mucia's intention to turn to his advantage any circumstance that might
                     offer, I was convinced, knowing full well that he totally lacked the courage to
                     commit a bold, nefarious act. He had too wholesome a terror of the law's
                     punishment.</p>
                  <p>"I wish I had spoken with you first," said Jeffers.</p>
                  <p>"I wish you had," I answered, truthfully enough.</p>
                  <p>"But I somehow got the impression that you wouldn't do. You have a devilish
                     honest look," he said, with a grin.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, that's what I go upon. A man's talents would be very much crippled if he
                     couldn't appear as 'O. K.' as the world around him; and, in fact, I feel just
                     as honest and respectable as any man."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, of course, why shouldn't you. A man may do a few little things that would
                     look bad on the outside, but when you come to get down to the motives and the
                     circumstances that forced him to commit them, there is natural enough excuse
                     for him."</p>
                  <p>He was saying that to stultify and quiet his own qualms of conscience.</p>
                  <p>"What do you suggest doing with Mucia? We outrank you now in numbers."</p>
                  <p>"Mucia, whatever be his participation in this thing, will be in the way of your
                     marrying Miss Creighton. Of course he would want to make himself as secure as
                     possible."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, that has been in my mind some little time."</p>
                  <p>"Now, the only safe plan is to declare your intentions to him at once, and if
                     he does not accord freely, or if he winces in the least, I'll take command, and
                     will put the matter right through without delay. I'm for having everybody put
                     his hand to the plough, and no shilly-shallying; nothing short of that would
                     satisfy my men."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, you can have the vessel as your collateral. Macao Joe wants to get to
                     Havana, in the West Indies, after everything is over. He has changed his plan
                     since I sprung this scheme on him."</p>
                  <p>"When shall we break the ice? Time is precious: we must be getting into the
                     vicinity of the groups on this side."</p>
                  <p>"Say to-night in the midwatch. What do you say?"</p>
                  <p>"To-night be it then. I have some preparations to devise; I will continue in my
                     present status; you go on with your part. Have some cutlasses and pistols sent
                     into the forecastle for my men at dark. That is about all for the present; you
                     can tell Mucia I'm all right, and get him used to the idea of four shares to
                     the money; and, by the way, my men can't be put off with a little bit.</p>
                  <p>"That I know, and they shall have more than the others," replied he.</p>
                  <p>"Well, there's nothing more, I believe," said I.</p>
                  <p>"No, we had better separate; old Creight will be up presently. <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">Adios Captain</foreign>," and he moved away. I went down to
                     my quarters.</p>
                  <p>"The mid-watch will tell the tale, after all," I muttered on reaching the
                     place. There was no especial reason for the delay of Mucia and Jeffers up to
                     this moment, as they had possession of the gold, the vessel, and the persons of
                     the few not in the plot, who could offer no resistance with hope of success.
                     But they were both to take the irretrievable step, with the men in the
                     forecastle and myself upon their hands. They had hoped that we would be put
                     ashore on some remote island under the delusion that they were what they
                     appeared, thus greatly lessening the probability and possibility of our after
                     interference with them. Furthermore, they were loth to proceed to the length of
                     deliberately taking life—though their men would not have scrupled at it a
                     jot—for the single reason that they lacked experience and familiarity with
                     murder. But they knew that, rather than the money should slip through their
                     hands, the gang of miscreants now cumbering the Nautch Girl's decks would
                     commit any atrocity, no matter how great, when once set in motion. Upon them
                     they relied for the bloody business, intending to keep aloof from
                     participation, and leave them clandestinely in some out-of-the-way corner when
                     all was over.</p>

                  <p>After taking a cup of coffee, I went again to the forecastle, and explained
                     everything to the men. They were to come up on deck now, unmolested, and be in
                     readiness for the climax. I then went to my quarters, and wrote a statement
                     which I sealed in a bottle, taken from the pantry. It was to provide against
                     the worst, but it was well to take all the chances. The paper in the bottle
                     contained these words.</p>

                                 Macao half breed, called Macao Joe, living lately as Putterrum.

                  <p>This was placed in the air port, opening out-board from my quarters, where it
                     would be unperceived in the darkness, and ready to be thrust overboard if all
                     failed. After a short time I again went to the forecastle, and found those
                     there busily engaged loading the firearms which had been supplied them, and
                     expressing astonishment at the changed aspect of affairs, and also a fixed
                     determination to succeed or die. I learned from Kitler that the merchant had
                     admitted his conviction of having been made the victim of an artfully contrived
                     plot and that I and the men were now fully restored to his confidence, but that
                     he feared it was too late to be of avail, unless by the intervention of some
                     unusual good fortune. He had deplored the wounds received by my men at the
                     hands of the armed crew, and promised that ample amends should be made if he
                     ever got clear of his present danger.</p>
                  <p>On my return I met Jeffers, and perceived from his remark how narrowly my
                     deception of him had escaped exposure. He had brought a sheaf of cutlasses
                     himself, and handed them down into the forecastle. Kitler having returned and
                     related what the merchant had said, the men naturally mistook the<pb
                        n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6013-00000060" /> source and object of the arms, and
                     made, in their way, some comments. These, however, happened to be so expressed
                     as to admit of two constructions, but when he returned with the pistols, one of
                     them remarked: "If we had had these things last night, them mokes would not
                     have had the deck now. You tell the old chap, though, that we'll walk him out
                     of his trouble when he sounds his horn." This was the remark that Jeffers had
                     in mind when he said, after a short conversation on the matter in hand, "Your
                     men think that you are in some difficulty yet; they spoke of 'bringing the old
                     chap out of his trouble.' I suppose they meant you."</p>
                  <p>Without exhibiting any change of countenance, I merely said, "I suppose so,"
                     and proceeded to speak of something else.</p>
                  <p>The helmsman struck eight bells—eight o'clock. In four hours more my scheme
                     would succeed or fail miserably. I might lose my life, and so might Mr.
                     Creighton, in the struggle. It was a dreadful thought to die then. She would
                     then go on to her fate, whatever that might be, with the impression on her mind
                     of my miserable antecedents and general execrable character. The thought was so
                     repugnant that I resolved to break through my promise to her father, the exact
                     reason of which I could not fathom, and undeceive her while there was yet time.
                     With that purpose, I was upon the point of descending to the after cabin, and
                     had reached the companion-way, when she emerged from it. The night was pleasant
                     and genial; the moonlight shone softly on the sea, silvering a pathway on the
                     sluggish billows away out to the horizon.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>You</emph> here," was her low, mournful exclamation, as I confronted
                     her. What a volume was expressed in the tone of those two words. Her face was
                     calm but sad, and the light from the lambs below, streaming up from the
                     companion-way, showed me that her father was keeping his own counsel.</p>
                  <p>The man at the wheel was a spaniard, who I knew understood scarcely a sentence
                     of English. Mucia and Jeffers were below drinking, and Macao Joe was forward
                     with his men</p>
                  <p>"What can you want," she added, as I still confronted her without speaking. At
                     last I answered, "I wish to speak with you,"</p>
                  <p>"I thought our speech was done with by this time. Say quickly what you have to
                     say, for I would not be seen in conversation with you,"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Creighton has obtained from me a promise, the reasonableness of which does
                     not appear, that I will not disclose to you your present jeopardy, and my false
                     position. But I must tell you. Mucia and Jeffers seek to obtain possession of
                     you and the money on board, and contrived my disgrace and discharge from
                     command as a preliminary step. My confession of their charges in the cabin,
                     together with an acknowledgment of the truth of what the cabin boy has reported
                     (mistaking me for the double whom you and whom <emph>I</emph> know very well,)
                     was merely a piece of strategy, which I made use of to open Mr. Creighton's
                     eyes to the deception practised upon him. The decisive struggle will take place
                     to-night in the mid-watch. I am now supposed to be in the league against Mr.
                     Creighton and yourself. The chances of success are only moderate. I may lose my
                     life, your father may also die; and I could not bear the thought of leaving you
                     to remember me as the abandoned wretch whom you heard openly confess his
                     turpitude this afternoon."</p>
                  <p>While I was uttering these words, a light of gladness appeared stealing back
                     into her pale features, and at the conclusion she gasped with a half doubting
                     inflection:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, if this were only true."</p>
                  <p>"A few hours will prove or disprove it."</p>
                  <p>"I believe it now, and never wholly doubted you till I heard your own
                     confession."</p>
                  <p>"You can, if you see fit, acquaint your father of what I told you."</p>
                  <p>"I shall not mention it. I can do no good by doing so, and am both pained and
                     puzzled that he should ask such forbearance of you. I am afraid it bodes—"</p>
                  <p>She paused. There was a shadow again upon her face as she left the sentence
                     unfinished.</p>
                  <p>"I dare not, for your safety, remain longer here. Mucia or Jeffers would
                     suspect if they saw us; and even the helmsman has appeared to glance this way
                     quite as often as he does at the compass. May God protect you."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXXIII—THE MID WATCH TELLS THE TALE.</head>
                  <p>How tiresome seemed each hour. At seven bells (half past eleven) it seemed as
                     though a cycle had elapsed. Jeffers and Mucia had been drinking freely, and an
                     angry altercation had broken out between them several times, subsiding again as
                     if by the pressure of the important business at hand. The unusually loud hum of
                     conversation among the men told my practised ear that liquor had been served
                     out to them also, and the occasional boisterous language of the Americans
                     indicated that they had partaken of a respectable share of it.</p>
                  <p>I had informed Mr. Creighton of my plan of action, which was to divide the
                     opposing numbers by decoying about one half of the gang into the forward cabin,
                     and securing them there while the issue was tried in a hand to fight with the
                     remainder on deck. The interview was hurried and abruptly terminated, but he
                     gathered enough of the plan to create in his mind a feeling of assurance of our
                     final success, which I was far from sharing.</p>
                  <p>The row began a little earlier than was anticipated, and in the following
                     manner.</p>
                  <p>For an hour Jeffers and Mucia had been in consultation in the forward part of
                     the vessel, where a continual din of English, Spanish, Malay and other tongues
                     vibrated on the stilly tropical night. The two leaders appeared to be at
                     variance on some essential point; and their dissensions had drawn in the
                     respective crews as partisans, which did not tend to an amicable adjustment of
                     the disagreement, whatever it was.</p>
                  <p>I had cautioned the Americans to keep aloof as much as might be from the
                     others, and myself paced up and down in the waist, remote from the dense group
                     forward,</p>
                  <p>It was a dead calm. One of the lately appointed Spanish mates was pacing the
                     quarter deck, glancing occasionally down into the after cabin. I heard Mucia
                     say, "I'll have it all my own way if I choose. Who the devil are you,
                     anyhow?"</p>
                  <p>The helmsman struck eight bells (twelve o'clock) as Jeffers came to the main
                     hatch, where I stood. He was somewhat fired with brandy, and exclaimed
                     abruptly.</p>
                  <p>"We've got to handle Mucia and his whole infernal crowd."</p>
                  <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6013-00000061" />
                  <p>"Speak lower; they can hear you fore and aft," I said.</p>
                  <p>"We might as well commence <emph>right now</emph>," (with emphasis.)</p>
                  <p>"Wait," I replied, fearing that he was about to frustrate my preconcerted
                     arrangements by precipitating a fight <choice>
                        <sic>beiore</sic>
                        <corr>before</corr>
                     </choice> I had secured a portion of his men below, "wait, or you will give him
                     a great advantage; remember our arrangement. The man that has possession of the
                     gold can dictate to the rest. Gather over half of your men and go down and take
                     possession of the box; carry it into the forward cabin, and place your men with
                     it. Be quick, now.</p>
                  <p>He strode forward and soon returned with a troop of his miscreants, headed by
                     Macao Joe, the only sober one in the gang. The oblique eyes of that knave
                     twinkled with the brutal joy of expectation as he passed in the light of the
                     forward companion way. Down they went with a drunken growl into the cabin and
                     Jeffers with them. I thought there <emph>might</emph> be a scream, but there
                     was none. Up they came again, a knot of them clustering around the heavy box as
                     they dragged it along the deck a short distance, when one burly villain
                     shouldered it and plunged down into the forward cabin, followed by the
                     remainder, who gave a yell of triumph and clashed their kreeses and cutlasses
                     as they descended. Kitler and the one called Scotty stood by and slammed too
                     the companion doors, drew the slide over and fastened it securely with its
                     brass padlock. The Spaniards and a few of Jeffers' men left on deck had rushed
                     to the waist, a little puzzled at this sudden movement, and blaspheming in
                     Spanish and other tongues. I could not see Mucia anywhere. The Americans with
                     drawn cutlasses were moving about impatiently, and such exclamations as "We're
                     all ready, Doc," "Sound your horn, Doc," "What are you waiting for, Doc," rose
                     above the noisy scene.</p>
                  <p>At last Mucia appeared. He had remained forward probably with a view of
                     refraining from participating in the actual outbreak and violence, but hearing
                     his own men in loud commotion, came aft to see that he did not get outgeneraled
                     in any way.</p>
                  <p>"Get back from about that companion-way," I exclaimed to some of Mucia's
                     men.</p>
                  <p>Hearing this, Mucia rushed across the deck, and levelling a pistol a few feet
                     from my face, shouted: "Are you captain of this prahu, or am I?"</p>
                  <p>"I am!" I shouted, trembling with rage and hate combined, recollecting the last
                     night's scene. With a sweep of my cutlass I knocked his pistol overboard.</p>
                  <p>Not comprehending the situation, he shouted: "Knock him down there some of you,
                     beat his cursed head off.</p>
                  <p>His men and the others that remained on deck ceased their jangling, and stood
                     stolidly gazing upon the scene, viewing it as a fight between the leading
                     spirits, which did not demand immediate partisanship; and, in addition, there
                     were the American men, armed and among them. They knew it would be altogether a
                     different sort of fight from the preceding one, as the odds were largely
                     diminished, and their late antagonists now well-armed.</p>
                  <p>"Get hold of a cutlass, Jack Tit, and take a fair chance, for I'm going to
                     settle with you," I called out to him, in the true melodramatic style.</p>
                  <p>A light flashed over the scene. It was the steward with a lantern, standing on
                     the closed companion slide.</p>
                  <p>"What does all this mean," he exclaimed, grasping, with trembling hand, a
                     cutlass from one of his men, who appeared loth to let it go, apprehending
                     instinctively that something dire was about to take place. Meantime there was a
                     thundering on the companion doors from the inside. "Hurry up, Doctor," shouted
                     some one, impatiently.</p>
                  <p>"It means that you are baffled, taken in at last, and in a bad way. Remember
                     last night, and make the best fight you are able." A sickly pallor overspread
                     his face, and he prepared for the onset. That was the battle cry. It was
                     followed by a clash of cutlasses, curses, yells, and pistol flashes. At the end
                     of some pushing and shoving, intermingled with groans, blows and cries for
                     quarter, the Spaniards and others broke away and fled for the galley, the
                     forecastle, and the fore hold. Those taking refuge in the galley were hunted
                     out of it, and driven into the forehold with the others, and the hatches were
                     put on and the hatch bar fastened down. The forecastle scuttle was secured
                     also. In the meantime, those in the forward cabin thinking that the struggle
                     going on was only between the Americans and Mucia's men, commenced at the
                     instigation of Jeffers for the purpose of maintaining the latter's ascendency,
                     supposed that the companion doors had been fastened by Mucia, for his party
                     were tolerably quiet considering all things Jeffers coming from the cabin where
                     he had been having a violent scene with the merchant, comprehended at last the
                     true nature of affairs on deck. Rushing to the companion-way he shouted:</p>
                  <p>"Break your way out Joe, or we are all ruined."</p>
                  <p>"What you say?" shouted that worthy from within.</p>
                  <p>"Burst out, break out, through the cabin bulkhead, or we are all gone."</p>
                  <p>Hearing him shouting thus. I ran from forward, calling ont, "Lay aft here,
                     everybody, they are going to break out." Jeffers, on my approach, pointed a
                     pistol, but it missed fire, and he darted away. The noise of heavy blows now
                     resounded in the forward cabin, and the crashing of planking told that the thin
                     bulkhead was yielding. Rushing into the merchant's cabin just as several of the
                     splintered planks had been torn away from within, I saw Macao Joe and two
                     others crowding themselves through A vigorous drive or two with the cutlass
                     point cleared the breach. A pistol was fired on the inside, and the bullet made
                     what sailors would call a "blazing star" on a large mirror above the
                     transom.</p>
                  <p>"Better go on deck, Miss, they ain't a going to give it up easy," said one of
                     the men.</p>
                  <p>I looked around. Miss Creighton, pale and a little agitated, was beside me.</p>
                  <p>"Are you hurt?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"Not much." But I felt the smarting of a flesh wound upon my arm, received some
                     time in the fight, from the point of a kreese.</p>
                  <p>Bang went another shot.</p>
                  <p>"The next bloody willain that shoots shall be crucified," shouted Speed at
                     them.</p>
                  <p>"Surrender in there." I called out.</p>
                  <p>"Don't surrender, Joe; it's a gone case if you do. Make a charge out," shouted
                     Jeffers, looking down<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6013-00000062" /> the after
                     companion-way, with pistol and cutlass in either hand.</p>
                  <p>"Let me git at that bloody sar-pint," and Speed dashed up the stairs. There was
                     a pistol-shot, followed by the clattering of cutlasses and a deal of hard
                     swearing. Then there was a cry, and the sound of the combatants running.</p>
                  <p>"Do you <choice>
                        <sic>infernai</sic>

                     </choice> scoundrels surrender, or shall we massacre the entire party?" I
                     called out.</p>
                  <p>"What for we surrender?" said Macao Joe.</p>
                  <p>"To save us the necessity of breaking all the ship's crockery with pistol
                     balls."</p>
                  <p>"You tink we care dam bout de ship's crockery?" he answered.</p>
                  <p>"Answer quickly, your time is getting short."</p>
                  <p>"You put us ashore, pose we surrender?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I make no conditions:"</p>
                  <p>"Come up here one or two o' ye, and help me fetch this man," cried Speed from
                     on deck. Two men went.</p>
                  <p>"If Mista Jeffer surrender, we surrender. He no surrender, we no surrender.
                     Burn up de ship fust."</p>
                  <p>"Burn away; we will take to our boats, and let you all burn up like
                     cockroaches."</p>
                  <p>"If you're waitin' for Jeffers, you needn't wait; he's about to go to his long
                     home."</p>
                  <p>There was a movement in the rear of us as Speed said this; and turning I beheld
                     the two men supporting by each arm a pale, ghastly wretch, with his face bloody
                     and his moustache saturated with and dripping blood.</p>

                  <head>Why Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar cures so many diseases.</head>
                  <p>Every one knows that Tar is one of the most powerful modifiers of the mucous
                     membrane and this membrane lines the Stomach, Intestines, Throat, Lungs,
                     Bladder, &amp;c. &amp;c. and it is its action upon this membrane which gives.
                     "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" such great success, and gives it the prominent place
                     it now has in the world. "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" is a clear fluid, divested
                     of all foreign matter, rich in the medicinal properties of Tar, pleasant to the
                     taste, and endowed with efficacious properties. Try one bottle.</p>
                  <p>A farmer living in Zell Township, four miles west of Boonsboro, Iowa, named
                     Harrison McCloskey, contracted a severe cold early in the Spring of 1868. He
                     could get no relief—grew worse, spit blood, had severe pain in his side and
                     breast, night sweats, loss of appetite, and could do no work of any kind. He
                     was completely cured by the use of Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar, and has gained
                     twenty-five pounds in weight, no cough, good appetite, and able to do any
                     work.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman in West Cornwall, Conn. named Hamilton B. Howard, writes that he
                     has used Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar for Bronchitis, and <emph>it has entirely
                        cured him</emph>, although his family physician pronounced his case beyond
                     cure. A friend who knew the merit of Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar, prevailed on him
                     to try it, and he sends permission to publish his statement.</p>

                  <p>"He pinted down here, and wanted to come down here, sir. Nothing else would do
                     him," said one of the men with him, apologetically, as the merchant looked at
                     them with a stern expression of inquiry.</p>
                  <p>There was a hum of voices inside as, looking through the cracks made by the
                     started planking, his men saw the condition of their chief.</p>
                  <p>"It—is—no—use—Joe. We—are—gone up," slowly articulated Jeffers. Then turning
                     his gaze toward Miss Creighton, he uttered in a deep broken tone the single
                     word "Fannie". At this the young girl bowed her head upon her father's breast,
                     and wept as if her heart was breaking. I do not think I ever witnessed such an
                     outburst of sorrow. Nothing was said; even the wretches on the opposite side of
                     the bulkhead were hushed. Jeffers was laid upon the transom, and Miss Creighton
                     went to him.</p>
                  <p>"Spose you put us ashore, all right; if not, we bust open dis box and trow de
                     money out de air port," said Macao Joe, after a pause.</p>
                  <p>"Let them do it! Let them do it!" said Mr. Creighton.</p>
                  <p>"There is no need of that. It is a cowardly, disreputable act in us to permit
                     it. Stand by everybody to follow me."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Creighton said, with an expressive wink, "Let them do it; tell them to go
                     on and do it." Then speaking to the Portuguese, "Go ahead and throw it out,
                     Joe."</p>
                  <p>I thought of infernal machines, noxious gases, and caged <choice>
                        <sic>rattlesuakes</sic>
                        <corr>rattlesnakes</corr>
                     </choice>; but never hit upon, the right solution.</p>
                  <p>"Come men, stand by, we'll not allow that if we have to kill every thunderin
                     raskil in there," said Kitler.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Creighton, however, interfered, and with a sign endeavored to explain
                     something. We were all puzzled and stood back.</p>
                  <p>"Bust opin dat box dere," Macao Joe was heard to exclaim. "Take de second mate
                     hatchet."</p>
                  <p>There was a continued thumping for a while with a splitting sound following it,
                     and to that succeeded a general yell of surprise and disappointment from the
                     men within. A running fire of native execrations followed, and Macao Joe's
                     voice was heard announcing his willingness to surrender unconditionally. They
                     were led out one and two at a time, disarmed, and marched on deck where they
                     were tied to the rail in a row. The bulkhead was knocked back in its 'place,
                     and' the wreck generally cleared up. I stepped in to look at the contents of
                     the box. It was sand and buck shot, loosely mingled in a stout looking bullion
                     box made of teak. And all this misery was for that. The merchant explained that
                     he had provided it for any occasion that might require<pb n="122-123"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000063" /> a heavy bribe. For example, detention in the
                     harbor by the patrol boat; or peradventure "the thing was
                        <unclear>possible</unclear>—treachery on the part of any whom I had
                     trusted"—were his words. I felt that I myself was included among the possible
                     recipients of the prospective black mail. I also was seized with the conviction
                     that Mr. Creighton must be a very wealthy man.</p>
                  <p>On looking for the bottle containing the statement alluded to in a previous
                     chapter, I found it in pieces on the floor, but the paper was no where to be
                     seen.</p>

                  <p>Those of the first party defeated, who fled to the forecastle, were ordered up,
                     and came with but little delay. They were badly out and stabbed, some of them
                     dangerously. Those also from the fore hold were brought up, and all not
                     mortally wounded were lashed to the spare spars, the rail, ring bolts, or any
                     secure place that afforded room without interference with working the sails.
                     The felucca presented a very queer appearance, with the crestfallen gang strung
                     around the rail or down at the ring bolts by the hatches and at the guns.</p>
                  <p>Moved by feelings of common decency, I examined and dressed the wounds of those
                     most seriously hurt, after ascertaining that my own men were but little wounded
                     this time. Coming back to the waist just as the natives had been secured, I saw
                     men gathered around a prostrate man.</p>
                  <p>Scotty said "That man's a dyin', gentlemen."</p>
                  <p>"Where is he hurt the must?"</p>
                  <p>"Stand back, men, and give the man air."</p>
                  <p>"By granny, they musn't try to run over people."</p>
                  <p>"Now what good did it do you to say that to a dyin' man?"</p>
                  <p>Scotty—"That man's a dyin', gentlemen."</p>
                  <p>"You'd better toll him that again. it'll make him feel good."</p>
                  <p>And so on. They placed him on a mattress and I examined the groaning wretch
                     carefully. He was not dangerously wounded, but severely cut upon the head in
                     two places, and had a thrust as if with the point of a cutlass in the chest and
                     abdomen. However, no large blood vessels were severed. I closed the wounds with
                     sutures, and placed a pledget of lint under a loose bandage, and left him to
                     such comfort as he might take.</p>
                  <p>Some of the others were as badly hurt.</p>
                  <p>Jeffers, however, was not anywhere near his "long home," as Speed had thought,
                     but was only faint and weak from the loss' of blood and his own miserable
                     emotions. Miss Creighton, now entirely oblivious of his dark treachery toward
                     her father and herself, watched and attended upon him with the pity and
                     solicitude of a sister. Those acquainted with the sympathetic and somewhat
                     inconsistent nature of a warm-hearted woman will not wonder at this. Upon
                     consultation with Mr. Creighton, he was, I found, strongly inclined to the
                     measure of landing them on the nearest island. To this course I made no
                     objection, not wishing the trouble and delay which the delivery of them to the
                     authorities would occasion. Besides, I did not wish to have any detention in
                     relation to the cruiser affair, which would most assuredly follow. Mr.
                     Creighton's indignation toward Jeffers was great and he would have retained him
                     for further disposal, but his daughter pleaded so long and earnestly for the
                     only brother of her childhood's days, that he consented to release him with the
                     others. A day passed away, and the next brought us up to a small uninhabited
                     island, where the greater portion of the day was consumed in landing the entire
                     gang of pirates, and some stores for their subsistence. The water being shoal
                     for a long way out, the passage to the shore with a few at a time occasioned
                     delay. A mattrass was put into the boat, and Mucia placed upon it. The
                     suffering wretch found his tongue at last, and muttered, as the boat was
                     lowered into the water:</p>
                  <p>"I'll come up with you, yet," addressing me.</p>
                  <p>Jeffers, when his turn came—he was the last of the wounded—said: "I am a
                     miserable man. I wish to die." Miss Creighton leaned over the rail and bid him
                     good-bye, in tears. Macao Joe sullenly got into the last boat, saying: "Well,
                     dis is one dam bust all aroun'." On the return of the boat it was hoisted to
                     its place, and the Nautch Girl's sharp bow was pointed for the Straits. How far
                     I had implicated myself in releasing these criminals I did not precisely know,
                     and cared still less. The Spanish boy that was with Mucia's men took occasion
                     to leave them and remained on board by permission. From him I gathered a
                     tolerable account of Mucia and his men, which I will hereafter relate.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXXV—COMING TO AN UNDERSTANDING.</head>
                  <p>Many were the pleasant moments that fell to my lot even in the short time that
                     elapsed before the Nautch Girl entered the Straits. We passed through the
                     groups of islands and inlets that gem and endanger the thoroughfares of these
                     eastern seas. Like the sirens of old, they enchant with their beautiful
                     exterior afar off; and woo the passing mariner with the spice-laden breezes,
                     that sigh tunefully among the nodding palms. But beware! A broad reef fringes
                     and encircles them with its dangerous deceptive loom of distance, and its
                     sunken branches make far out beneath the fair emerald surface. In many of them
                     pestilence and death lurks in the still rustling jungles at the waterside, and
                     what have been poetically denominated the 'spicy breezes blowing soft o'er'
                     Java's isle, are but the aromatic miasma floating away from them laden with
                     death. Not all, however, are so to be considered. Many salubrious sea-washed
                     Edens reveal to the presence of the delighted visitor all that has been spoken
                     of them in story and song. Stretching away to the horizon like a panoramic
                     creation of the scenic painter, lay those emerald peaks glittering in the
                     sunset glow.</p>
                  <p>"We soon shall be in the straits now—<emph>too soon</emph>," said Miss
                     Creighton as we stood gazing upon such a scene.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Creighton appears very impatient to get there, of late particularly."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I know." And she was thinking of something that brought a shade of
                     seriousness upon her features. "Where are you going with this vessel when we
                     leave it?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"I don't know now; perhaps to my own country."</p>
                  <p>"Have you got a home there?"</p>
                  <p>I did not want to admit that the door's of my childhood's home were not open
                     with a welcome to the returning<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6013-00000064" />
                     turning wanderer, and attempted to evade a direct answer; but who can deceive a
                     woman interested in knowing all about one?</p>
                  <p>"Poor boy, you are a homeless wanderer,"</p>
                  <p>"I am not a poor boy by any means. I have hope and a will to do, and the world
                     is before me."</p>
                  <p>"But any one is poor, indeed, who has no one to love and long for their
                     return."</p>
                  <p>"'No one to love, no one to caress,' as the song says." I answered, lightly.
                     "But I have been happy in the thought that I did have some one to love me a
                     little."</p>
                  <p>She blushed, very slightly, but answered calmly.</p>
                  <p>"I meant other love. The warm, pure affection of a mother (I have longed for
                     that myself), and the hopeful pride that springs from a father's heart."</p>
                  <p>"I have neither," I answered.</p>
                  <p>"Your mother is dead?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, years ago."</p>
                  <p>"And you had a step-mother?'</p>
                  <p>"Yes. You are good at guessing."</p>
                  <p>"I thought so. When did you leave home to wander?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, a long time ago."</p>
                  <p>"And have not returned since?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, several times."</p>
                  <p>"And wouldn't stay?"</p>
                  <p>"I could not. There was no place there for me. And I pleased them best when I
                     spoke of leaving."</p>
                  <p>"What kind of man is your father.'</p>
                  <p>"An iron man."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! yes. And you are not going back home again?"</p>
                  <p>"No, never. Not till I am called home, which will be never."</p>
                  <p>We conversed of other things, her life at Putterrum; our first meeting; and by
                     natural sequence arrived at the first night on board the felucca. I thought of
                     my dream which had passed till then from memory.</p>
                  <p>"Were you laughing or crying when you sat in my chair by the chart table just
                     after your bewildering conversation with me on the night of our departure?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, it is not polite to investigate a lady's emotions."</p>
                  <p>I related my dream.</p>
                  <p>"Your dream was correct, then; I was weeping, though I cannot tell why. I do
                     not know why."</p>
                  <p>"The second part has also come to pass. The struggle and even the waking
                     presentiment of evil was a true harbinger," I returned.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, you would do well to write a dream-book How interesting all this would be
                     to my old Ayah at Mauritius. She had the most unbounded reliance on all sorts
                     of superstitious signs and omens."</p>
                  <p>"But the figure in the bridal dress has spoiled the completion of the other
                     visions," I said.</p>
                  <p>"You must hope for the fulfilment of that also. There was no limitation of
                     time, was three?" she answered naively, and turned away.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Creighton had come on deck and commenced with his morning promenade on the
                     quarter deck. It seemed even now that a lurking glance of distrust was in his
                     eyes when regarding me, at least the look was not friendly. Whenever he
                     addressed me, the tone was cordial, but after a generous explanation on his
                     part, touching recent events that seemed in justice to demand it he spoke to me
                     but seldom, and then only on subjects requiring a conference.</p>
                  <p>As soon as her father retired below, which he did after a short promenade, she
                     again introduced the subject of the dream, saying.</p>
                  <p>"There was one part of your dream that will, I hope, not be fulfilled. The
                     chains! You said that you were loaded with heavy chains. It is a pity that you
                     should have dreamed that, for you cannot hope for the <emph>other</emph> part
                     being true without fear that it will be <emph>too</emph> true."</p>
                  <p>"I begin to feel the chains now," I said: "and they are not light, as Cupid's
                     chains are supposed to be."</p>
                  <p>"Why, you are speaking very gravely about a trifle," she replied.</p>
                  <p>"I have noticed that you seldom speak to me when your father is on deck; and
                     when we are in conversation his appearance is a signal for your
                     withdrawal."</p>
                  <p>"I must tell you something. It is what I alluded to when saying I had something
                     to tell you, if the steamer did not catch us. I am afraid that he has taken a
                     dislike to you for some cause. He has said nothing; but I know him so well that
                     in whatever relates to me his manner and ways betray before he speaks. If not
                     increased by what he would view as further grounds for his dislike, it will
                     pass away. I hoped it would have done so before now; but since the exposure of
                     Mr. Jeffers' treachery, it has increased somewhat, notwithstanding all you have
                     done. Now papa is very distrustful of any one whom I like. It is not very
                     flattering to be sure; and I was going to tell you that morning of this trait
                     of his, that you might not appear too glad to see me, or too anxious to improve
                     the miserable little time that I shall be on board. Papa dislikes every one
                     that I like or that likes me; and I don't see how I am ever to get a husband
                     comfortably," she concluded, with a slight pout.</p>
                  <p>"Why did you not speak of it before," I asked.</p>
                  <p>"There was no need. You appeared intuitively to understand it; so I would not
                     run the risk of hurting your feelings by saying such a thing. We were not so
                     well acquainted then, you know."</p>
                  <p>"And are we much better acquainted now?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, I feel as though I had known you for years."</p>
                  <p>"Must I continue to think of you as one whom I may hope to obtain only through
                     the working of a miracle?"</p>
                  <p>"How?" she asked, a little startled.</p>
                  <p>"Why, with all respect to Mr. Creighton, the eradication of a deep seated
                     prejudice from an Englishman's mind is a miracle."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I hope not. There is something that greatly increased his dislike to you
                     since or at the time of your exposure of Mucia and Mr. Jeffers. What it can be
                     I do not know. But it cannot be anything but what will give way in time, as he
                     knows you better."</p>
                  <p>I knew what it was, and felt that it would never give way.</p>
                  <p>She continued: "Papa considers that I am only distantly acquainted with you,
                     and would, if he knew how well I like you, insist upon a <choice>

                     in love with some 'unsuitable person,'—that is his phrase for those whom he
                     dislikes—that any one whose society is at all agreeable to me, meets with but
                     small cordiality from him. I am loth to deceive papa, for I love him with all
                     heart, but—"</p>
                  <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6013-00000065" />
                  <p>"But what?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know what else to do," she answered slowly, with a sigh.</p>
                  <p>"If you will find a paper that I handed him on the day of my 'confession, it
                     will show you that there is but little use in attempting to deceive him, or
                     little hope of his dislike to me ever giving way."</p>
                  <p>She soon after went below, to search for the paper, I thought; and I also, to
                     look for a letter that I had written on the day preceding my accusation by
                     Mucia. Being called on deck just as I had finished it, I forgot to seal the
                     envelope, and thrust it into the pocket of my loose grasscloth jacket. Some
                     time afterward I thought of it, but it was gone. The more important issues then
                     at hand caused me to forget it; and now I sought to find it again, though I had <choice>

                        <corr>made</corr>
                     </choice> some previous search for it. This search, like the first, was
                     fruitless, and I concluded and hoped that it had fallen overboard, little
                     thinking that the unfortunate letter was yet on board, to rise in my path like
                     a cobra.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXXVI—IN THE STRAITS.</head>
                  <p>From the boy that was with Mucia's party, and whom they treated very brutally,
                     if his word was to be taken, we learned that Mucia was a runaway sailor from
                     the American bark Oscar, and that at Guam, a port in the Philippines, he got
                     possession of the papers alluded to. These papers were left in a room which had
                     been used as a consul's office, and which was afterwards taken for a gambling
                     den. Mucia, following his instincts, sought for a gaming establishment while on
                     liberty at that port, and obtained the papers there. He afterward ran away from
                     the vessel at an island near the place where we found him, and, speaking their
                     language, fraternized with some Spanish sailors whom he found there. These
                     latter were wrecked seamen from a small Manilla trader. After their vessel was
                     taken charge of by a wrecking tug, they having unwarrantably broken bulk, that
                     is, broken into the cargo, left it. After Mucia's arrival, the plan was
                     concocted of passing themselves as crew and captain, the better to obtain a
                     passage away from the island. Mucia told them boastingly that he had been
                     obliged to leave the United States for some misdemeanor, but the truth probably
                     is, that he became destitute, and shipped on board a whaleman, as many do.</p>
                  <p>We drew near the Straits. Sails innumerable dotted the water in all directions.
                     Fleets of gaudily painted junks rolled sluggishly on with the wind free in
                     their uncouth-looking ribbed sails, and <choice>

                        <corr>picturesque</corr>
                     </choice> prahus skimmed along on the wind, overshadowed by great triangular
                     wings of matting that swept them over the billows like gulls, their outriggers
                     kissing the curling billow tops, or splashing the white spray from an
                     occasional one higher than the others. Lumbering merchantmen, from all quarters
                     of the globe, bound in, freighted with articles of a nation's handiwork, passed
                     by; others returning homeward, laden down with the rich products of India's
                     prolific soil. Beautiful clippers, from my own great land, cleft the seas with
                     the characteristic eagerness of the race that sent them forth, and straight
                     built war-ships ploughed sternly outward, urged by the flukes of Vulcan and
                     swelling canvas. Blue on either bow, the lofty outline of the mountains trended
                     away into indistinctness, while the horizon line ahead dotted with sails, spoke
                     sadly to my heart of the approaching farewell, for it was the entrance to the
                     Straits.</p>
                  <p>"I want to get a passage in one of Greene's ships, if I can," said the
                     merchant. "I thought at Putterrum that I should not be at all particular, so
                     that I got aboard of one that flew the English flag; but as we have a choice
                     it's as well to get a good, comfortable ship, while at it.</p>
                  <p>I was gratified at that decision as the time for the dreaded farewell would,
                     perhaps, be stayed yet a little while longer in waiting. Right ahead, then, was
                     a large English Indiaman; bowling along in our track; but by the mark in her
                     foretopsail she was not one of Greene's navy. The merchant, looking at her in
                     the glass, said:</p>
                  <p>"I've a strong mind to go in her, and not wait, she is a large ship."</p>
                  <p>"No, papa, I <emph>know</emph> she is not a comfortable ship. I can see that
                     without a glass. See how she pitches about."</p>
                  <p>Miss Fannie had evidently something of a sailor's eye, though her objection
                     might have been prompted by another motive.</p>
                  <p>"Speak her at any rate, and see if any of Greene's vessels are close
                     behind."</p>
                  <p>We lulled into her track, and made preparations for speaking her. The coming
                     ship hauled up her courses, clewed down her royals and topgallant sails to
                     decrease her headway. As she came within hail I shouted through the
                     trumpet:</p>
                  <p>"Ship ahoy!"</p>
                  <p>"Aye, aye!"</p>
                  <p>"Are there any of Greene's ships behind you?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, three. They will be along about to-morrow noon if nothing happens."</p>
                  <p>I waved adieu with the trumpet and she passed on her voyage.—Another day, and
                     then—then what? I had no purpose for the future now but to face and overcome
                     one rising obstacle to my hope of happiness. I felt that it had already risen,
                     and, like a genii of the fates, stood barring the avenues to rest and
                     tranquility, saying, "Thus far and no further."</p>

                  <p>The Nautch Girl, with her stores, armament, small arms, and ammunition, was
                     formally made over to me. After this was properly completed, a check was drawn
                     for myself on Singapore, and another for an amount which was to be divided
                     equally among the crew.</p>
                  <p>"I will now furnish you with certain letters and credentials that will greatly
                     facilitate the obtaining of new papers for this vessel. You see the propriety
                     of so doing, don't you?" I assented, and thanking him, withdrew while he wrote
                     them. I had stood off the land to lessen the possibility of accident, to make a
                     tack on again at daylight. While gazing over the ship's side, Miss Creighton
                     came softly to me.</p>

                  <p>"What do you think of calling her?"</p>
                  <p>"I know of no prettier name in the world than Fannie."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, in remembrance of me?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, in remembrance of you."</p>
                  <p>"Then you will have"—she paused.</p>
                  <p>"Two Fannies to think of. Yes, and between them both, I shall have enough to
                     keep head busy and heart sore," I replied.</p>
                  <p>"But <emph>one</emph> will not stay in your thoughts very long," she responded,
                     with a certain tone which did not imply a strong belief in her own words."</p>
                  <p>"Does every woman like to be told over and over again how much she is loved?" I
                     asked.</p>
                  <p>"I don't know, but I suppose they like to feel <emph>sure</emph> of it," she
                     replied, quite naively.</p>
                  <p>"Well, my letter at Putterrum you told me was very explicit in that way." She
                     smiled the mischievous glad smile that I first saw on the hill road, and
                     exclaimed:</p>
                  <p>"Well, that <emph>was</emph> a simple letter."</p>
                  <p>"I thought it was rather carefully got up."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I dare say. Did you ever write to a young lady before?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I never did."</p>
                  <p>"I thought not. It said in every line as plain as one could wish—"</p>
                  <p>"What?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, it is too good to tell," she answered in a smiling tantalizing manner.</p>
                  <p>"Come, what did those few formal lines express other than what I intended them
                     to?"</p>
                  <p>"They told how utterly miserable you were at the prospect of leaving Putterrum,
                     and how much you feared that I was in some way connected with the mysterious
                     departure of the vessel, and how certainly you would have returned at the risk
                     of your life if—" Again she stopped and I finished the sentence;</p>
                  <p>"If you had not turned out to be on board. Yes, I will admit that such were my
                     feelings and intentions. But there was nothing in the letter that expressed so
                     much."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! you wrote a very foolish letter; with all your quickness you don't
                     comprehend how thoroughly a woman can analyze and dissect a man's thoughts on
                     paper."</p>
                  <p>"If that is the case I would not have it extant. Did you destroy it?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I have it here," she said, taking it from her pocket and holding it
                     up.</p>
                  <p>"Will you give it back to me?"</p>
                  <p>"By no means; I shall keep it forever. I have another specimen of your
                     literature."</p>
                  <p>"Where did you get that?"</p>
                  <p>"I took it from papa's jacket pocket," and she held up a crumpled bit of paper.
                     It was my hurried penciling in the cabin.</p>
                  <p>"You had better destroy that, at any rate."</p>
                  <p>"Never! I shall keep these two little bits of paper as a memento of my first
                     and last and only real love affair."</p>
                  <p>"Are you certain it will be your last?"</p>
                  <p>"I am certain. Whatever ill-fortune may interfere to prevent our happiness,
                     there is no fate that shall take from me the sweet reflection of having kept
                     the faith, waiting for God's own time."</p>
                  <p>How noble and beautiful she looked saying this. Glancing at the paper her eyes
                     filled with tears.</p>
                  <p>"Poor Mr. Jeffers," she said in a low voice. Her eye had caught his name and my
                     revelation of his love for her.</p>
                  <p>The cabin boy came with a message from the merchant, desiring his daughter's
                     presence in the cabin. I waited for her reappearance on deck, as it was a
                     glorious moonlight night, and seemed created expressly for all the lovers of
                     that hemisphere, but I waited in vain.</p>

                     long sharp prow divided the sluggish groundswell.</p>
                  <p>The helmsman stood gazing meditatively into the binnacle, as with one hand he
                     slightly moved the wheel at intervals to keep the felucca on her course.</p>
                  <p>Around us glimmered the lights of distant vessels, and above the felucca's
                     broad wings loomed through the moonlight in spotless whiteness the reef points
                     whispering with the friendly breeze that wafted us forward.</p>
                  <p>The lead was hove, and I went below to note the chart.</p>
                  <p>The swinging lamp shed a dimmed light upon the soundings registered thereon,
                     and I went to the locker in the steward's pantry to get another. A murmuring
                     sound of conversation was audible in the after cabin, and after the getting
                     lamp, as I turned to go back to the chart table, I heard Miss Creighton,s
                     voice, heretofore inaudible, utter with a wild sob of anguish and despair,
                     certain words that sounded like a knell to our hope of happiness.</p>
                  <p>Those words I will place at the termination of a conference which preceded
                     them, which conference Mr. Creighton had called his daughter to participate
                     in.</p>
                  <p>How I obtained the elements of this conversation between the father and
                     daughter, without listening, is not pertinent to this narrative. It is
                     sufficient to assert that I did obtain nearly the exact words, and in an
                     honorable way.</p>

                  <p>"Very good. We can come at once to the point. By that paper you have seen, if
                     you did not see it before, (which of course you did,) that the young gentleman
                     who has done so much for us makes a pretence of loving you."</p>
                  <p>"A pretence; why, papa?"</p>
                  <p>"Very well. Admitting that he is perfectly sincere and devoted, that's
                     reasonable enough, too. Admitting all that, now, what do you or I know about
                     him?"</p>
                  <p>"We know what we have seen."</p>
                  <p>"And what have we seen? Look at it now without the prejudice of his faithful
                     works to bias you, or any transient and fleeting affection that you may have
                     permitted in your heart; look at the circumstances as a young lady should do,
                     and what will a calm scrutiny reveal? It will reveal this much: That<pb
                        n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6013-00000067" /> the young man is a very unsuitable
                     person to claim an acquaintance even with a respectable, virtuous young lady.
                     Had it not been that his bravery and zeal entitled him to claim respect and
                     consideration at our hands, I should have forbidden your speaking to him at
                     all. When at Putterrum, our critical position demanded that the most qualified <choice>
                        <sic>persod</sic>
                        <corr>person</corr>
                     </choice> in our party should ascertain certainly his trustworthiness and
                     suitableness, before placing ourselves in his hands, I consented that you
                     should see and have speech with him. Your indiscretion the day previous
                     afforded you a good opportunity <choice>

                        <corr>without</corr>
                     </choice> excuse for renewal on his part. Our circumstances and the general
                     exigencies of the situation would justify so much; but there it should have
                     ceased; and when you came on board this vessel it should have been as a
                     stranger to him. He never would have presumed to seek a renewal of the
                     acquaintance himself. But you have gone and fallen foolishly in love with him
                     at first sight—a most monstrous, unheard-of piece of indiscretion and
                     indelicacy, and totally without precedent in decent society at least The like
                     was never heard of before out of the novels. Now, this would be a very simple
                     matter to rectify, if this were all; but his late courage and devotion—noble
                     conduct, I will admit—have so complicated my position in this matter that I am
                     forced to call upon you to do for me what would otherwise be a very simple and
                     evident duty. I want you to send him about his business."</p>
                  <p>"Papa, do not ask me to say an unkind word to him, for I could not do it."</p>
                  <p>"Well, my dear daughter, it is only an act of evident justice, after what he
                     has risked for us, that he be undeceived, and not left with a foolish hope to
                     distract him from whatever career in life he seeks. That much he is justly
                     entitled to at our hands, and he must be treated like a man and a
                     gentleman."</p>
                  <p>"You appear very much prejudiced against him, papa."</p>
                  <p>"I am prejudiced, my dear, deeply prejudiced, I will admit, and not without
                     sufficient reason. Let us now examine him from a calm disinterested standpoint.
                     What were your impressions respecting him on the occasion of the fight with the
                     steamer? Remember now his extreme youth, his not having been a naval officer—at
                     least he does not admit it, and if he has, and conceals it, it is a very bad
                     sign—and but little acquaintance with his men and vessel. Yet there he stood
                     during that fight, with a very queer expression in his eye, coolly and quietly
                     managing the affair with all the air of a man used to such scenes of strife and
                     danger; the air of a man used to running fights, either from or toward his
                     antagonist. He seemed to know all about it. He seemed to know altogether too
                     much about the business he was engaged in. I say, what did you think then of
                     him?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, papa, I thought he was a here."</p>
                  <p>"Now, my dear, that is just the difference between youth and age. I formed a
                     very had opinion of him, I can assure you. I then from that moment formed a
                     suspicion of the straightforwardness of his antecedents. Now let us look
                     further. He comes to Putterrum unknown, with no apparent business there but to
                     get away again immediately. He has a double there; that looks very bad. He
                     knows no one, but comes hunting about the beach for a speculation. He knows no
                     one, but he can put his hands on a very good fighting crew on the very shortest
                     notice. Macao Joe could not get together a crew as easy as that Then he seems
                     never surprised at anything, and ready with an expedient in the most critical
                     moment of danger. Look at the first night out there with the bangkong; the
                     quiet manner of ridding himself of that, his coolness in the first fight with
                     those precious scoundrels Mucia and Jeffers, the frightful nonchalance of his
                     deportment in the cabin next day; the utter disregard of his wound. I don't
                     think he has spoken of it yet. I havn't heard him mention it; I've been waiting
                     to see if he would. The only change that is observable is the changing of his
                     pantaloons. Then the facility and ease with which he affected to join the plot
                     against us, and deceived them so thoroughly. All these things, my dear, say to
                     me in most unmistakable terms, that he is a very unsuitable person to be on
                     terms of any sort with my daughter. Now there is one more point that I have
                     reflected upon much, since my mind was <choice>
                        <sic>trauquil</sic>

                     </choice>, and I would not harbor an <choice>

                        <corr>ungenerous</corr>
                     </choice> suspicion against him after what he has done, for I want to 'speak
                     well of the bridge,' you know; but I merely call your attention to it that you
                     may look at these things without unreasonable prejudice. Do you think that I
                     and my supposed gold, and you my dear, would have been so heroically defended
                     and so safe if the chances in his mind, for his future welfare, had been more
                     promisingly set forth by a different course—if you had treated him with
                     coldness and reserve, holding no speech with him whatever? I am afraid it is
                     ungenerous, apparently, for me to say so, but I think not."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, papa, how ungenerously you are speaking of that poor, noble young man! I
                     would not have him know of your sentiments regarding him for the world. I do
                     think that he would have striven as conscientiously and honorably to protect
                     you if I had treated him with scorn, or had never been in existence?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, you are talking exactly as I feared you would, my dear, but I shall go
                     on. You can defend him, and I hope I may be wrong. To return, this person given
                     but a very meagre account of himself. He says he lives somewhere in America, on
                     the banks of some river, I've forgotten what."</p>
                  <p>"The Susquehanna, papa, I know all about it."</p>
                  <p>"You know all that he has told you, no doubt. But to proceed. He does not say
                     who his connections are, or what they are engaged in, or what he is doing out
                     in this part of the world. Jeffers, with his faculty for sounding people, could
                     not get at anything on that head, and from some business cards and a commercial
                     envelope, with a medalion on it, left in his room at the Sicundar Bagh, and a
                     few other stray facts, I am nearly convinced that he is the son of a very
                     wealthy man. A firm that I happened to have known of incidentally, while at
                     home, corresponds to those business cards exactly. His name was identical with
                     that of the leading member of that firm, evident from the<pb n="132-133"
                        xml:id="VAC6013-00000068" /> simple fact of his signature at his consul's
                     where he got money. The name that he bears now is fictitious, and put on for
                     occasions of this adventurous kind. Jeffers hunted him out as thoroughly as he
                     could, and his characteristic report was: 'All right for our business, but
                     something very wrong about him.'</p>
                  <p>And without doubt there is something <emph>very</emph> wrong about him. Pay
                     attention now. This wealthy firm are one of the heaviest exporting houses in
                     their port, and employ a number of young men, in various departments of their
                     business. Not one of them, I'll venture to say, has more talent, taste, or
                     material ability than this man. Now, then, as I said before, the father of this
                     young man I know incidentally to be a fine, upright, staid old gentleman. His
                     name was often mentioned in connection with benevolent projects, and he is well
                     known and widely respected in his extensive circle of acquaintances, both
                     business and social. Now, if this is his son, and I think it is, what is he
                     doing away off here, concealing his name, and making a living by roaming about,
                     if his record is as it should be at home? Wait a moment till I am through. You
                     and I know that he is smart, temperate, apparently industrious, anxious to get
                     on in life, has a very honest look generally, and on the whole, is exactly such
                     a son as any man would be proud of, and happy to establish in life to keep him
                     at his right hand, if there was not some dark, mysterious something or

                     "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" such great success, and gives it the prominent place

                     of all foreign matter, rich in the medicinal properties of Tar, pleasant to the

                     could get no relief—grew worse, spit blood, had severe pain in his side and
                     breast, night sweats, loss of appetite, and could do no work of any kind. He
                     was completely cured by the use of Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar, and has gained

                  <p>that is silently deplored, and carefully concealed, while he is bidden to take
                     another hemisphere for his abode, to avoid sullying the honor of the rest of
                     his family. In short, there is <emph>crime</emph> there, my dear child; and I
                     should be but a poor father to you, indeed, if I did not plant myself squarely
                     in your path, at whatever cost of present suffering, and turn you back from a
                     fate that I can see would only end in a slow, wretched death in life. No, no,
                     my dear, no outcast can have the guardianship of my child's happiness. When
                     your mother was dying, she said, 'David, pray let Fannie's life be made happy,
                     and do not neglect her in the struggle for wealth.' I feel that I have not
                     altogether been faithful to that dying injunction, out under Providence, from
                     this time to my death I will make your happiness the paramount thought of my
                     life."</p>
                  <p>"But, papa, I can wait till something is known definitely of him. I can't
                     believe that he is so bad. I know that he has committed no unworthy act. He has
                     told me the reason of his being a wanderer.—He has a stepmother, and his father
                     is a stern, selfish man. If I—"</p>
                  <p>"All those statements of his prove nothing, but that he wants to work upon your
                     sympathies. Another evidence only against him. That story of a stepmother or a
                     stepfather is as old as the everlasting hills, and the stock excuse made use of
                     by every wanton and every young scamp of a thief, when forced to give a
                     starting point for his or her career of knavery. I am done with this part of
                     the world, and I am going to wash my hands of it forever, and it the young man
                     was well known as a respectable, upright and wealthy young gentleman, I even
                     then should be loth to have him for a son-in-law, simply because I want to cut
                     loose completely from this side of the earth, leaving all acquaintances here
                     that were made here, and am determined to do it. It is reason, prejudice and
                     superstition, all in one. The idea of your picking up an unknown and
                     questionable lover on the flight out of Putterrum—a man whom I hired to risk
                     his neck for pay—is repugnant to my sense of decency to the last degree."</p>
                  <p>"You did not hire him, I know that much. The last words I heard him speak in
                     Putterrum were to the effect that he had reserved the right to withdraw from
                     the business at any time, and that it was appearing to him as he proceeded very
                     disreputable, and that he would abide entirely by what I advised. He was glad
                     to meet with one upon whom he could rely for such advice. If I had told him to
                     abandon it, we probably should not have been safe now."</p>
                  <p>"Well, well, I can't see anything<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6013-00000069" />
                     good about him but his fidelity to us and his bravery. That goes a great way
                     with women, who always make the great mistake of thinking that because a man is
                     brave he is a Chevalier Bayard as a matter of course. The greatest miscreants
                     we know or hear of are fearless of death; and, in fact, to an upright man life
                     is dearer than to one whose life is already forfeited, and who sooner or later
                     must come to his doom.</p>
                  <p>Now to conclude, I will tell you where I think this young man has been
                     acquiring that knowledge of ordnance and running fights with cruisers, and all
                     the concomitants of a nautical desperado, where he has grown so wonderfully at
                     home in commanding reckless turbulent spirits. Do you recollect that account in
                     the Singapore papers of a private armed league organized for the pretended
                     object of cruising against the Chinese pirates and all freebooters, in these
                     waters, to be self-supporting from the right-of-capture theory in the prizes?
                     They would not have made their salt in that way, and they did not expect to.
                     They contemplated cruising about in armed vessels, protected by the Chinese
                     Commissioner's manifesto (and whatever documents he issued for the purpose at
                     the time of the outlawry proclamation), to do a little plundering here and
                     there in out of the way places, in a variety of ways, so that the onus of it
                     would be foisted on the Chinese pirates and those in the Archipelago. Old
                     Stott, of Foo Chow, was at the head of it, and concocted the whole scheme. The
                     cruiser at last waked up, and displayed some little activity for a while, which
                     caused them to hunt out of the way corners for refuge; and I'll wager my life
                     against a rupee that this is one of the officers in old Stott's Combodia navy,
                     crawling out to pick up a vessel for another cruise."</p>
                  <p>"And, papa, why cannot he be just what he appears to be and nothing more—a poor
                     young man tired of wandering, and anxious to go back to his own country, or
                     somewhere else, and go to work."</p>
                  <p>"Just because he is not, my dear; that's a woman's reason, and another is that
                     he knows altogether too much for a man of his age and appearance about ships,
                     and guns, and running fights, and surgery. Why, did you see the skill with
                     which he probed after bullets, and stitched up the wounds of his men and the
                     others?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, that's proverbial of his countrymen; they can do a little of everything,
                     and supply with ingenuity the place of experience."</p>
                  <p>The dear girl! Her heart prompted the true solution of the matter.</p>
                  <p>"Well, I have said this much to prepare you for what I am firmly <choice>
                        <sic>aud</sic>
                        <corr>and</corr>
                     </choice> irrevocably resolved upon."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, papa, do not say that, but wait and see. Let us try."</p>
                  <p>"Don't talk of trying; its nonsense with me. I tried Jeffers. God knows how I
                     wrought with him and strove, for the sake of his unfortunate early life and the
                     frank, open countenance that promised well when I first took him up. But I saw
                     at last that his occasional drunkenness would increase and unfit him ere long
                     for any further confidence. He had served me faithfully, and was attached to us
                     both. I told him that his future life would be provided for, beyond the
                     probability of accident. When I told him of my preparations for his return to
                     Putterrum he seemed ungratefully dissatisfied, and, as it turns out, went
                     straight to plotting for my money and your ruin. He threatened, the night of
                     the late attempt to take the vessel, to carry me back to Putterrum if you did
                     not marry him. So much for trying outcast men and boys. I am done with that,
                     whatever other follies are still in store for me. Now, here is this young
                     devil, rising up from the ashes of Jeffers, and attempting to take advantage of
                     the peculiarly romantic position that he has forced or fought himself into, and
                     is trying to steal away the heart and happiness of a poor motherless girl, who
                     has had no fitting one to seek for counsel and guidance in matters of this
                     sort."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, don't say that, papa, for I was the one who—who"</p>
                  <p>"Well, well, it's all the same my dear. Whatever his motives may be, you know
                     that mine are unselfish. I know that I must lose you in time. I am prepared for
                     it, and want to secure only your true happiness. Rich or poor, I shall offer no
                     opposition to the man you take for a husband, provided he be honest and
                     straightforward; but I tell you now, forever and for good, that none but such a
                     man will take you away from me with my blessing. Now, here is a letter picked
                     up on deck, where he and Mucia had their first struggle. I retained it until I
                     should convict him thoroughly of what we then believed him guilty. I have
                     retained it yet for this reason. In handing it to him I wished to call his
                     attention to the person to whom it is addressed, and note his demeanor under my
                     questions. It is not sealed, but I have not looked <unclear>at it</unclear>,
                     from motives of common honesty, though I believe him to be a scamp. I have
                     deferred even speaking to you of my repugnance to him lest he should see with
                     his infernal quickness that my money was not likely to get to him through you;
                     and then he in his turn might want to take me back to Putterrum. There would be
                     no self-interest counterplotting to save me then; and you would be gone
                     forever. We have spoken a vessel here, and to-morrow I will take my child away
                     from his presence and infernal fascination forever, and I would rather that you
                     would save me the unpleasant duty of notifying him that he is to speak to you
                     to-morrow for the last time on this earth, I hope, and most likely in eternity
                     too, unless a great change indeed takes place in him. Now this letter will
                     decide whether you or I shall do it. If the gentleman I mentioned is not his
                     father, then I will demand some explanation of his career and circumstances;
                     and if he can give a proper account of himself, all then may pet be as you
                     hope. But, on the other hand, if he is the son of that gentleman, the matter is
                     ended now forever; and nothing will induce me to tamper with the happiness of
                     my child, by leaving any hopes on her or his mind to breed future heart sorrow.
                     You then must dismiss his hopes. I will send for him now and give him the
                     letter."</p>
                  <p>The messenger returned saying that I had gone below to sleep.</p>
                  <p>"Very well. To-morrow will answer even better than to-day."</p>
                  <p>"Give me the letter. I will look at it. I can not wait. We are one now in the
                     sight of God."</p>

                  <p>On hearing these words, that smote upon my heart with a dim foreboding, I went
                     hastily to the deck and passed along to the after companion way. There was some
                     little movement among the servants below, and their hurried, low tones,
                     frequently interrupted by the merchant's sharp, excited voice, indicated
                     something unusual going on there. I listened for Miss Creighton's voice, but it
                     was not to be heard. Then I guessed the truth. She had fainted.</p>
                  <p>I waited with eagerness for the usual exclamations of the attendants when the
                     patient is returning to consciousness. Still, nothing came up but the ayah's
                     low, frightened voice, calling to her young mistress in trembling sobs. I was
                     upon the point of descending unbidden to the cabin, for my suspense now had
                     become anguish at her long swoon, when the merchant exclaimed with an
                     inflection that I shall long remember: "She must be bled, call that
                     cursed—"</p>
                  <p>I sprang down to my stateroom where had been left the pocket-case belonging to
                     the medicine chest, and returning met the servant. I sped past him. Reclining
                     upon the transom cushions in the place where she had bent so tenderly over
                     Jeffers a few days before, was Miss Creighton, pale and Madonna-like, then in
                     her deathly swoon. Stripping up the flowing sleeve of her jaunty Indian jacket
                     with a mingled feeling of guilt and indignation, I sought for the blood vessel.
                     Her white supple arm rested heavily in my hands as I endeavored to distend the
                     vein by compression. It seemed a cruel necessity that demanded the lancet's
                     keen point in that alabaster skin. The warm blood trickled faster. I stopped
                     the flow at length with a compress.</p>
                  <p>The merchant buried his face in the pillow, and groaned, as a man so stricken
                     only can.</p>
                  <p>I bent down to the sweet white face, and pressed my lips upon her forehead.
                     Then it seemed as if it would be a relief to die too. There was a faint,
                     shadowy quivering of the closed eyelids, but it was transient and fleeting as a
                     shadow. Again it returned, more perceptible than before, and the dark lashes
                     raised slowly a little way. The ayah was crouching on the carpet, uttering a
                     low, plaintive wail, and rocking to and fro in the untutored expression of
                     grief. The servant stood apart, gazing mournfully at his master.</p>
                  <p>I dared not look at or listen to the cabin boy, who was weeping as though his
                     heart would break, lest my tears should also gush forth, feeling that I had no
                     right to such relief, except alone.</p>
                  <p>Fearing to call the merchant back to hope yet, lest he might meet a deeper
                     despair, I refrained from uttering the glad words that sprung to my lips at a
                     gentle pressure of <choice>

                     upon mine with a fixed, faint pressure, and the fringed lids again half
                     revealed those eyes fixed with melancholy vacancy upon mine. How I trembled
                     lest they should close again; but stealing slowly back into their liquid depths
                     came the light of life and consciousness. With her eyes fixed on mine there
                     came a smile faint and feeble, that played waveringly upon her lips, ere it
                     wreathed itself there, in the gladdening conscious smile of life anew. She
                     spoke slowly, and with an effort, my real name. Then all started to her side.
                     She was safe back again to us; to me. I bent down to her ear and whispered a
                     few words. Her eyes closed, naturally, now, as from weariness, and all was
                     quiet. I gave place to her father and the attendants, and contemplated the calm
                     tranquility of her rest, as the subtle life-tide ebbed and flowed feebly but
                     steadily in its channels once more.</p>
                  <p>The brave young heart was beating again, happily, for the blighting weight of
                     sorrow and despair that had crushed it down to the dark threshold of the great
                     unknown was rolled away, leaving the mysterious essence of vitality, till now
                     so nearly flown, to spring np and gather life with each succeeding pulsation.
                     My mission was done, and I left her to the sacred privacy of the moment.</p>
                  <p>"Anything happened dangerous down there?" was Kitler's remark as I came to the
                     deck.</p>
                  <p>"Yes. Miss Creighton had fainted, but she is recovering now." And that was all
                     that was <choice>

                  <p>The father and daughter conversed long into the night. When, after all was
                     still below, the merchant came on deck, I read in his face the indications of
                     more difficulty, and asked him respectfully, but earnestly, if he had drawn a
                     moral from the late painful scene. He replied:</p>
                  <p>"Providence may visit upon us a swift retribution for attempting in our
                     ignorance to interfere or control the working of its inscrutible measures, but
                     reason is all we have to guide us in this world; and as it has sufficed to keep
                     the world aright so far, I am not one to lay it aside in the dearest offices of
                     our responsibility here below. Still, I am much changed."</p>
                  <p>"So, also, I am much changed; and how far I might have come short of my duty,
                     in deference to your authority and the customs of men, before my eyes were
                     opened, I can not say; but I would now no more dare to relinquish my right of
                     demanding the precious gift which the God of nature has said is mine, than<pb
                        n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6013-00000071" /> I dare commit any other crime in the
                     eyes of the Almighty."</p>
                  <p>He looked at me with a curious expression, and had I then known what he had
                     said but a few hours before to his daughter, I would have known that his mind
                     was harboring a fear that I would demand his daughter then and there, under
                     pain of taking him back to Putterrum.</p>
                  <p>"I must demand time, both time and conditions. It is imperatively necessary;
                     and I insist on proceeding very guardedly," he replied, with the obstinacy of a
                     man knowing his power.</p>
                  <p>"And what if the conditions are not fulfilled?"</p>
                  <p>"Then you must wait till they are," he answered.</p>
                  <p>He walked away, not in very tranquil frame of mind, I thought, and descended to
                     his cabin.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XLI.—THE FAREWELL.</head>
                  <p>The morning found the Nautch Girl running gallantly into the Straits. Miss
                     Creighton stood by my side, but the flow of word and sweet thoughts was gone.
                     We conversed but little; and the coming separation weighed heavily. She was far
                     from having fully recovered from what the previous day had brought to her young
                     life.</p>
                  <p>It was near six o'clock, p.m. Up to this time no suitable vessel had passed;
                     and the hope sprang up in my breast of being yet another night in the same bark
                     that held all I cared for on earth.'</p>
                  <p>We were sitting together on a seat near the companionway. I had given orders to
                     Kitler to notify me if anything needed my presence on deck. The sunlight was
                     mellowing softly down to dusk. An hour more and he would plunge behind the
                     horizon, thus securing another night of happiness and pain. She had just been
                     telling me of her <choice>
                        <sic>ealy</sic>
                        <corr>early</corr>
                     </choice> life, and also of the last wearying year of activity and suspense at
                     Putterrum, where she must seem always cheerful when she felt always sad, and
                     gay and miserable at the same and every moment of the weary, weary days.</p>
                  <p>"One o' Green's ships a-coming, sir," Kitler called down the companionway. It
                     sounded like the voice of the executioner. I felt that sad choking in the
                     throat which all mankind well know, as I went on deck.</p>
                  <p>Right ahead, plunging her gaunt bows into the billows, and then rearing them
                     majestically again, came one of the London East Indiamen. Her bright copper
                     flashed in the sunset as with a sidelong roll the huge lead-colored mass,
                     cleaving through the billows, would lift its wedgelike bows and show her copper
                     line back to the main chains.</p>
                  <p>"Here comes a ship with forty feet of dead wood," said a sailor, alluding to
                     the extreme sharpness of her bows.</p>
                  <p>"That is one of Green's new ships; this is her second voyage," said Speed.</p>
                  <p>"You are all ready, I suppose," I asked of Mr. Creighton.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear me, yes! I've been looking for this moment a year."</p>
                  <p>"Make ready to speak that vessel, Kitler," I said, and went below.</p>
                  <p>"Come up, Fannie, your father expects you on deck, I think. We must have our
                     farewell now; there will be no other chance."</p>
                  <p>She blushed and smiled with the brightness of hope in her radiant but pale
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"I am glad to see you in good spirits. There is nothing like keeping up a show
                     against the enemy It seldom does hurt, and many times serves a very important
                     purpose." I continued,</p>
                  <p>"How do you feel?"</p>
                  <p>"All serene, as the men say," I continued in a light tone, which was far from
                     my real feelings, for my heart was heavy as lead.</p>
                  <p>"Oh yes, for I <emph>know</emph> that whatever happens you will let me hear
                     often, and come if I send for you."</p>
                  <p>The tone of these words startled me, for it was the tone of a woman trying to
                     still with her own words a frightened misgiving heart.</p>
                  <p>"My dear, there are times when it is unworthy to doubt, and this is one."</p>
                  <p>The Indiaman was now but a short distance off, and observing our preparations
                     to speak her, was hauling up her courses in like preparation.</p>
                  <p>"What a great ship it is. Papa, I hope you'll be <emph>comfortable</emph> in
                     it, as size seems to be a requisite with you."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I don't know, my daughter, I think we've all made out to be tolerably
                     comfortable in a vessel of this size. Tolerably," he repeated slowly, with a
                     bit of dry humor in his tone and look.</p>
                  <p>Nearer came the great hull, with a large Lascar and European crew clustering
                     along her rail. Her broad quarter-deck showed comparatively few passengers. As
                     she surged down toward the felucca's quarter I hailed.</p>
                  <p>"Ship ahoy!"</p>
                  <p>"Aye, aye!"</p>
                  <p>"Where are you bound?"</p>
                  <p>"London!" came through his trumpet.</p>
                  <p>"Is that one of Greene's ships?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, the Him-ma-la-ya!"</p>
                  <p>"Can you take some passengers to Capetown?"</p>
                  <p>"How many?"</p>
                  <p>"Four!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes!"</p>
                  <p>"Will you send a boat? There is considerable luggage."</p>
                  <p>"Aye, aye!"</p>
                  <p>She swung off, and bracing up forward and aft came to the wind with her
                     maintopsail aback. The time that was spared to us yet, waiting for the boat, we
                     made use of in feeling wretched and trying to conceal it. In this we were
                     successful; for on board the Nautch Girl none but the merchant and his servants
                     knew or suspected anything of our pain at parting. When the coming boat was
                     near at hand, Fannie recollected something left behind in the now deserted
                     cabin; and there was an opportunity for a satisfactory lover's adieu which I
                     improved. A large boat filled with strangers was at hand to bear her away.</p>
                  <p>She shook hands with each of the men who had fought so well for her. The
                     cabin-boy she took a kind leave of, having furnished him with means and a
                     letter to a missionary at Singapore. My turn came next. Her lip twitched a
                     little, but she said in what to the rest might have seemed her ordinary voice
                     and manner:</p>
                  <p>"You must not fail to see us if you come to England," and with a squeeze of the
                     hand the last leave was taken.</p>
                  <p>Brave girl! she came through it safely, but it was the narrowest escape from
                     bursting into tears I ever saw. And, to be candid, I was not very far from it
                     myself. Calling me aside, Mr. Creighton said:</p>
                  <p>"I will write you on my arrival in England. Remember and heed my injunctions.
                     They comprehend all that is needful for Fannie's and your happiness; and if you
                     have been following any pursuits that do not square with the world's view of
                     what is legitimate and regular, abandon all such <emph>now</emph>, while there
                     is time, so that your past can be set down hereafter as only the foolish,
                     irresponsible recklessness of youth."</p>
                  <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6013-00000072" />
                  <p>He stepped over the side and the boat shoved off. I watched it crawl over the
                     waves, get alongside, and after its precious freight was taken on board, rise
                     to its place on the cranes.</p>
                  <p>The Himmalaya swung off, squaring in her fore and cross-jack yards; and the
                     breeze wafted her away from me. I was alone with my loneliness.</p>
                  <p>"You want to brace forard, sir?"</p>
                  <p>I had stood forgetfully gazing at the departing ship, and Kitler's voice
                     reminded me that I was now at liberty to go <choice>
                        <sic>np</sic>
                        <corr>up</corr>
                     </choice> and down on the sea, to and fro on the earth, or whithersoever I
                     listed. "Brace forward." I said, and went down to the after cabin. Throwing
                     myself upon the cushioned transom, where she had <unclear>lain</unclear> poised
                     on the verge of death, I tried to weep for relief like a woman, but no tears
                     would flow. I gathered up what little articles she had left, a glove, a bit of
                     ribbon, and some little odds and ends, and put them carefully away.</p>
                  <p>Kitler came to know what course to steer. His question called to mind that she
                     had expressed an earnest desire to know of Jeffers, and wished that he might be
                     safe. It was a relief then to obey that wish; I would seek Jeffers.</p>
                  <p>"I am going back to the island where we left those men, to get Mr. Jeffers.
                     Keep her down the coast, I will be up soon."</p>
                  <p>She had said, with a prescience beyond her years and sex, "Who will take care
                     of the wounded in that crowd of baffled, selfish spirits? With no present
                     interest to keep them together, they will quarrel over their stores and
                     separate, each for himself, and leave the wounded by themselves. Poor Mr.
                     Jeffers, it would be such a relief to know that he at least was safely cared
                     for while he was wounded."</p>
                  <p>I determined to do that, for I could not forget that it was he, who whatever
                     the motive, placed the Nautch Girl and Fannie Creighton in my way. A fair wind
                     soon carried us down to the island; as we drew dear there appeared no evidence
                     of them at the place of landing; no living creature was visible on the beach. A
                     boat was sent out, and further search only revealed the fact that they were
                     gone from the island. As the boats crew were returning to the beach to embark
                     one of them picked up a paper and brought it on board to me. It was a copy of
                     the statement which I had placed in the bottle, but the writing was neither
                     Mucia's nor Jeffers'. I kept it as a souvenir.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XLII—CONCLUSION.</head>
                  <p>A short run brought us into the vicinity of Singapore, and through the familiar
                     island groups we sped till its imposing water front greeted the eye; a little
                     more delay in the loitering breeze and the Nautch Girl's anchor held her.</p>
                  <p>A new mast, yard and sail were made, and the felucca ere long was ready for sea
                     again. "Gideon's Band" stopped with the vessel, and they, together with some
                     new men shipped, when all was ready, made rather a heavier complement than
                     would appear necessary, but as the voyage projected carried us into out
                     of-the-way and dangerous localities, a large crew was proper enough, especially
                     as it cost but little more. The cabin-boy came back a few days after leaving
                     the vessel, and wanted to remain in his former berth. He brought with him from
                     the mission an English boy, who, having lived somewhere in the Phillippines,
                     could jabber fluently in Spanish, and the two had fraternized. The Spanish
                     boy's story was in substance that the missionary treated him kindly, and
                     proposed to retain him till opportunity should present of sending him home.
                     However, his good lady asserted that "the house should not be filled up with
                     ruff-scuffs from everywhere, even to Putterrum," and "what was Fannie Creighton
                     thinking and doing, a little tom-boy like her sending sailoring people to be a
                     nuisance and a hindrance to the mission?" It was probably some years since the
                     good wife had seen the "little tomboy."</p>
                  <p>So Fannie's protege was forth with put to work in the garden, and about the
                     premises, which employment it is my belief he did not take to very kindly.
                     Concluding to float around for a season before returning home, he came back to
                     the Nautch Girl, judging her to be the most suitable vessel for his vagrant
                     proclivities. The English lad was also anxious to ship, probably not wishing to
                     follow gardening as a permanent calling. I suggested the impropriety of my
                     taking him from the mission without the consent of the persons there who had
                     been providing him a living, but with the utmost candor he replied: "What, she?
                     Law, sir, she'll be ever so mighty glad I'm gone, that she will. She's a
                     gallivanter, she is." I formed some vague impression of what he meant to convey
                     by that phrase, and concluded that there would be no impropriety, as far as
                     that was concerned; as he would answer for a powder-boy, I kept him; not,
                     however, without some misgivings as I recalled a concentrated bit of wisdom
                     heard in my boyhood, to-wit: If you have one boy, you have him. If you have two
                     you have but one, and if you have three you have none at all. As I had kept
                     also the one who came with the Spanish crew, I had three; or none.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Creighton's letters and credentials procured me the requisite aid, and
                     after a short stay at Singapore, the Nautch Girl's sharp bow was pointed for
                     the islets of the Eastern seas.</p>
                  <p>"Doctor, do you ever expect to see that Putterrum gal agin? I'll bet you never
                     do, old hoss. You didn't play your cards fine enough, though you held a mighty
                     winnin' hand."</p>
                  <p>My rough friend uttered these words carelessly, without knowing how they sank
                     upon my soul like a leaden pall; but as the months flew by there came little
                     messengers to the wanderer, telling of the happy time drawing steadily on.</p>
                  <p>Jeffers and his companions were taken off from the island the next day after
                     their landing. I have seen him since; once in the crowded court room,
                     deliberately swearing my liberty and good name away. But the race is not always
                     to the swift. Again I sat before him for hours in the gilded hell of a Malay
                     chief. He was dealing faro. The golden discs clinked monotonously throughout
                     the long hours of a sultry tropical night, as I watched the man before me for
                     an expression of<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6013-00000073" /> recognition. It
                     would have been the signal for our final settlement.</p>
                  <p>There was with me at the table an old acquaintance, who was winning heavily and
                     regaining his losses of the previous night. He played but to get his own and
                     have done with the curse of gambling forever. I felt that his career for good
                     or evil was contingent upon his success, and forebore to disturb his luck,
                     though If he had begun to lose again, the calm unrecognizing eye of Jeffers
                     would have served him no longer. The splendid composure of the man on that
                     dangerous occasion compelled admiration, for none should know better than he
                     how much mercy to expect at the hands of those he had sought to imprison, and
                     failed. I was not alone, nor was he, for the punkas waved lightly to and fro,
                     like vampire's wings, over the groups sitting at the tables, or sauntering
                     along the corridors with impatient hands clutching kreeses and revolvers. Also
                     there, scenting retribution in the air were the villain accomplices in the most
                     gigantic man-trap ever sprung on a Malay. When one tampers with or jeopards a
                     Malay's liberty he never gets forgiven, though he might for attempting his
                     life. These had come at my bidding to follow in the search for the missing man,
                     who had been the prime devising spirit in this attempt.</p>
                  <p>I had traced him here and sat before him. He well knew what would follow hard
                     upon the first word of angry recognition. I had only to point my finger and
                     blood would drench the matted floors. Gaudily dressed young chiefs, thirsting
                     for vengeance, sauntered noiselessly as cheetahs up and down the gallery
                     without, or sat inattentively at the tables with dice and cards. Malay blood
                     was up, and their tiger ferocity hardly brooked the unaccountable indecision.
                     The stern undertone, the rattling of dice, and the clink of mohurt went on, as
                     I waited. He knew his hour had come, but it would seem recked little if it had.
                     There he sat, pale, wary and silent, watching the men watching me; yet never
                     turning his head quickly or exhibiting the slightest discomposure. How little
                     his life was worth then he well knew. It hung on a word; yet never the feeblest
                     of those involuntary motions of the facial muscles which betray the mind, was
                     perceptible, and the careless expression of his eye was simply magnificent
                     defiance.</p>
                  <p>My friend retrieved his losses; yet I waited. He gathered up his winnings and
                     retired a saved man. Even then I could not speak the word. The shining columns
                     of golden mohurs on the tables glittered in the greedy eyes of the Malay
                     chief-tons, and all were concluding that I had unaccountably deceived myself
                     and them.</p>
                  <p>My tongue refused its office. I panted for the pure and uncontaminated air
                     without, free from smoke and the fumes of brandy. I longed for darkness; to be
                     rid of the sight of the human tigers that waited on my word; for all through
                     those latter hours of apparent indecision was my purpose held by contending
                     forces. Up before me had risen a vision of the past, a retrospect, reaching
                     back to the night on board the felucca, when the motherless and brotherless
                     girl sobbed over the wretch. "Where is Jeffers," was the question I felt I
                     should have to answer. I remembered the pale lips of one speaking with a tender
                     deprecation of his conduct; of one who could not think of him but as a brother,
                     and hoped for his return to a better life. To add another weight to the load
                     wearying that faithful yearning young heart was a task for other hands than
                     mine. The sight of the rooms interior and all within grew hateful to me. The
                     avenging Nemesis I had invoked seemed all too eager then, and as I looked at
                     the vengeance-hungry chiefs, I foreswore the companionship of such forevermore,
                     no matter what the errand or end.</p>

                     ancestors a hundred years back, yet clothed in the rich stuffs of Christendom
                     and Asia, they are arrogant in their <unclear>gold-bought</unclear> association
                     with the white thrift-getting people. Such a horde as this waited patiently,
                     yet fiercely, for the first unguarded word of Jeffers. He had forfeited all
                     claims to mercy, and he asked none, but calmly trusted in his <foreign
                        xml:lang="TUR">kismet</foreign>, and it saved him, for there came at last an
                     urgent, hurried message for me. As I quitted the room abruptly, the movement
                     caused some slight confusion, and the crowd came with me to the galleries. On
                     returning, the game was going on at the table where Jeffers had been, but a
                     native was in his place. Jeffers had fled. The others having slipped away
                     before him, we considered it a mistake, and so it was left.</p>
                  <p>Could an unfelt agency have sped from another continent, sent on the pinions of
                     a pure child-love, to stay off the doom, and leave yet more scope for

                     perfunctory prayer. I never sought Jeffers since. He lives yet, and we may meet
                     again; but her love is a mantle of <choice>

                     mind that such was not my intention. Besides, you must remember that when it is
                     impossible to figure creditably ourselves, we are apt to leave the tale for

                  <p>Every one knows that Tar is one of the most powerful modifiers of the mucous
                     membrane, and this membrane lines the Stomach, Intestines, Throat, Lungs,
                     Bladder, &amp;c. &amp;c. and it is its action upon this membrane which gives
                     "Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar" such great success, and gives it the prominent place
                     it now has in the world. "Dr. Crook's Wing of Tar" is a clear fluid, divested
                     of all foreign matter, rich in the medicinal properties of Tar. pleasant to the

                  <p>A farmer living in Zell Township, four miles west of Boonsboro, Iowa, named
                     Harrison McCloskey, contracted a severe cold early in the Spring of 1868. He
                     could get no relief—grew worse, spit blood, had severe pain in his side and
                     breast, night sweats, loss of appetite, and could do no work of any kind. He
                     was completely cured by the use of Dr. Crook's Wine of Tar, and has gained
                     twenty-five pounds in weight, no cough, good appetite, and able to do any
