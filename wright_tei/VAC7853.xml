PERCY'S RELIQUES.&#xD;
UPON a glorious morning,, in the midsummer of 18-, two&#xD;
equestrian travellers spurred their horses up ,the ascen~ of&#xD;
the Eagle's Flight, the loftiest and most perilous pass o7the&#xD;
leghanies.&#xD;
Though the sui~ was near the meridian, and all the sky&#xD;
'                   above was "darkly, deeply, beautifully blue," and perfectly&#xD;
clear, yet all the earth beneath was covered by a thick, low-&#xD;
lying fog9&#xD;
On reaching the highest point of the pass, both travellers&#xD;
drew rein and paused, looking-.-N~rth, South, East, West-'-&#xD;
over the ocean of vapor rolling from horizon to horizon below&#xD;
them! And while they so pause, let us catch that nearly ver-&#xD;
tical ray of the s~in that falls upou them, lighting up the group&#xD;
like fire above, the fog, and daguerreotype them as they stand.&#xD;
Both are young men of' about the same age, probably&#xD;
twenty-five; both are well mounted upon fine bay horses;&#xD;
an~j both wear the undress uniform of the Regiment&#xD;
of Cavalry; and here all resemblance between them ceases.&#xD;
He on the right hand, who holds in his horse's head with&#xD;
so tight a rein, causing the gallant steed t~ arch his beautiful&#xD;
neck so gracefullyt while be lets fly a falcon-glance around&#xD;

TIIii~ CURSE OP CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
the shrouded horizon, is Archer Clifton, of Clifton, now hold&#xD;
ing the rank of Captain in the ~-~- Regiment of Cavalry.&#xD;
His form is of middle size, strongly built, yet elegantly pro~&#xD;
portioned. His comp~exmon is dark and bronzed as by ex.&#xD;
posture; his features are Roman; his hair and whiskers&#xD;
trimly cut, are of the darkest~ chestnut, with what painters&#xD;
call &amp;amp;ootijght~ Whii~h~i5 tck p~ tlii~t there is no warmth of&#xD;
coloring even wtie~re ~he ~iin' lights. Indeed, there is no&#xD;
warmth about the loQks of the Whole man. His eyes are&#xD;
singularjy beautiful and brilian*,~combining&#xD;
all those dark,&#xD;
shifting, scintillating, prismatic hues, that would drive an&#xD;
artist mad, for want of colors to portray, or an author to&#xD;
despair, for lack of Words to ~describe. He wears the dark&#xD;
blue uniform of hi~ regiment, and manages his noble charger&#xD;
with the ease and griic&amp;amp; only~to be found in the accomplished&#xD;
cavalry ofllcer. left 'hind, ~ ~~~gUiQ air and&#xD;
He                   ~-~-- ~                loosened&#xD;
rein, inclines his hodyforward; permitting his graceful horse&#xD;
to droop his head a~4, scent the earth, as in quest ?~ herbage,&#xD;
is Francis Fairfax, of Green Plains, a Lieutenant in the com~&#xD;
pany nnd~r'the. comina~jd: ofOaptairi.o.lif~0~ flei~ of aiout&#xD;
tbe~ me height of Clifton, bu~ his ~gure is slender almost to&#xD;
ity. His 'teatures.ar&amp;amp; delicate and piquant~ RI5 eom~&#xD;
plexion is fair and transparent. His hair is also very fair2&#xD;
and Waved off~fronm a forehead so~ snowy, round and smooth,&#xD;
as to seem childlike, especially with those clear blue eyes;&#xD;
that now brood roguishly under their golden lashes, as in~&#xD;
profound quest of mischief, and now light up and sparkle with&#xD;
fun and ftolic. He m~sman~ges hi~ spoiled pet of a steed&#xD;
with the ohar~ming insoUciance, only to be seen in the amateur&#xD;
poets painter, Player, musician, etc., etc., etc. And yet~&#xD;
there is sometimes an earnest, thoughtful aspect 1~bout the&#xD;
'youth, that Surprises one into the suspicion that all his levity&#xD;
is superficial,~~ hides his deeper and betternature, as stub..~&#xD;
ble sonmtiine~covers and conceal a mine of pm'ecious metal.&#xD;
"Well!"      last spoke, Mr.~F~iirf~x, " is is now about&#xD;
twelve hours since we were emptied out of that atrocjou8 old&#xD;
stage coach, which, for a week past, has 'leen beating us&#xD;
about in its interior, from side to side, and from seat to ceil...&#xD;
ing, as if we were a lump of butter in an old woman's churn,&#xD;
and whose kindest turn of all to us was, when it turned over&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIFTON9             19&#xD;
ud shook us out down the precipice, andinto the trough of&#xD;
he Wolf's Lick, as if we had been apples fed to the pigs!&#xD;
Oh! by the lost baronetcy of the house of Fairfax, my self-&#xD;
steem will never recover the effects of it! Perdition~ seize&#xD;
the picturesque at this price! And ever since long before&#xD;
daybreak this niornilig, have we been wandering about over&#xD;
hese mountain tops, with 'the earth below us hidden in mist,&#xD;
and only the highest peaks looming through the sea of vapor&#xD;
like islands in the ocean! And we plunging wildly about in&#xD;
the fog, like death on the pale horse riding the waves! 'And&#xD;
to the momentarily recurring risk of riding over some hidden&#xD;
precipice of a thousand feet perpendicular. If this be&#xD;
your glorious mountain scenery, to the demon with it!&#xD;
For I had as lief be on the open sea with the 'Ancient&#xD;
Mariner ~&#xD;
To this half petulant, half laughing philipic Captain Clif-&#xD;
ton, while his glance still roved over the shrouded hemis-&#xD;
phere, replied, with an indulgent smile-~-&#xD;
"You cannot see the face of the country for the morning&#xD;
veil she chooses to wear. But wait till high noon~ when the&#xD;
sun, her royal lover, in the meridian of his glory, shall raise&#xD;
thatgauzy covering, and she, like a right royal bride, shall&#xD;
~mile and blush in light and glory~"&#xD;
"By my soul, I could fancy the lady earth wore this veil&#xD;
to conceal fast gathei~ing tears, rather than smiles or blushes!&#xD;
./Inglic6, I think we shall have rain soon-though blistered&#xD;
be my tongue for saying it !-not about the 'rain 'but about&#xD;
the veil For, look you! F~ret as I may at this journey&#xD;
through the mist--yet this fine scenery, under a cloud as it&#xD;
literally is, gives me a feeling of breadth, grandeur] I ex~&#xD;
pand, spread out ever the vast area of its ~h~ouded solitudes!&#xD;
Oh! it is only on the boundless sea or on the mountain top,&#xD;
with a hemisphere below mue, that I feel ~ if I 'had i~oom&#xD;
enough to live in! And you give me a feeling of suffocation&#xD;
'by drawing in this a*ful shrouded 'world to the simile of a&#xD;
lady's veiled face! But it is not to be wondered at! No,&#xD;
by the shade of Mare Autony, and all otker great ~men, who&#xD;
held the whole world light in the balance with a 'woman's&#xD;
evanescent smile or tear! everything is aproixisA femmes&#xD;
with yotl now. Could the music of thee sph~r~ suddenly&#xD;
burst upon your astonished ears, as soon as ~7'had recovered&#xD;

your senses, your highest note of admiration would be to&#xD;
compare that universal diapason of divine harmony to Lady&#xD;
Carolyn's silver laugh !"&#xD;
"I do not recollect ever to have heard 'Lady' Carolyn&#xD;
laugh."&#xD;
"Ten thousand pardons! A Clifton of Clifton never&#xD;
laughs. But tell me, Captain, whereabouts in the world-&#xD;
I mean in the clouds, are we? And when shall we see this&#xD;
pure pearl of beauty and the rich casket that enshrines her;&#xD;
this stately lily of the mountains and. the parterre where she&#xD;
blooms ;-wheu shall we behold Paradise and the Pen..-.&#xD;
Clifton and Lady Carolyn '?"&#xD;
Without replying to this mock-poetic strain, Captain Clifton&#xD;
remained with his eyes still wandering from East to West,&#xD;
and back again over the rolling vapor. And Fairfax con-&#xD;
tinned-&#xD;
"I suspect now, by your abstracted air and wandering&#xD;
eye, that you have lost your way in the clouds-not the first&#xD;
time such a thing has happened to a lover, nor gould it be&#xD;
strange in a place like this, where the only land-marks are&#xD;
mountain tops sticking out of the fog with a day's journey'&#xD;
between each !"&#xD;
At this instant a distant group of peaks broke suddenly&#xD;
through the znist like newisles thrown up by the sea, and&#xD;
glittered whitefly in the sunlight against the deep blue&#xD;
horizon.&#xD;
"See!" exclaimed Clifton, roused from his apathy by the&#xD;
sudden apparition. "Look, Fairfax! I will show you White&#xD;
Cliffs! Look straight before you to the Western horizon-&#xD;
a little North of West. You see a crescent of seven peaks&#xD;
rising through the mist against the sky. ~That is White&#xD;
Cliffs."&#xD;
"Looking white enough at this distance-quite lik~ snow-&#xD;
capped mountains, in fact."&#xD;
"Yes. They ar&amp;amp;of ~white quartz, and their peaks rising&#xD;
from the girdle of dark evergreens around their base and&#xD;
sides, have quite a cooling effect in hot weather."&#xD;
"Ali! just so. Now how far off are those same blessed&#xD;
refrigerators V'&#xD;
"About twenty-five irdles in a bee-line, But the moun-&#xD;
tain road is very circuitous, and makes the distance nearly&#xD;

&#xD;
forty. However, if we ride well, we shall be able to reach&#xD;
Clifton in time to surprise Mrs. Clifton at tea."&#xD;
"Heaven be praised for that . possibility !" ejaculated&#xD;
Fairfax, as they prepared to descend the mountain&#xD;
side.&#xD;
As they rode down, Captain Clifton, warming slightly from&#xD;
his cool reserve, said-&#xD;
"I think, Fairfax, that you, poet and artist as you claim&#xD;
to be, will rather like Clifton. Tourists, who hayc visited&#xD;
our part of the country, think the scenery there, very fine.&#xD;
It impresses me merely as being unique. There is something&#xD;
formal-but, to myself, not therefore nupleasing in that&#xD;
crescent of seven peaks-~-the tallest being in the centre and&#xD;
gradually declining thence to the loii~est, which may be called&#xD;
the horns of the crescent, and point Southward. Those&#xD;
peaks rise from a forest of-first elms and oaks around their&#xD;
base; then pines farther up their sides; and last of cedars,&#xD;
above which rise the pinnacle of white quartz. This crescent&#xD;
of mountains surrounds and shelters from the North winds&#xD;
the family mansion, which is situated in the woods at its foot.&#xD;
North of the peaks, the country is wild and rugged, but&#xD;
partly covered with thick forest, and affording the best hunt-&#xD;
ing grounds in the world. There you may course the hare;&#xD;
track, the deer; or if your tastes aspire to a fiercer conflict,&#xD;
hunt the wolf, the wild cat, or the bear- !"&#xD;
"-Or the rattle-snake, copper-head, or moccasin! Thank&#xD;
you, I have no inclination for crusade against those menu-&#xD;
taineers," laughed Fairfax.&#xD;
"Perhaps you like angling ~ There is a trout stream at&#xD;
the foot of the wooded lawn, in front of the house. I must&#xD;
tell you about that, for it is the head waters of a fine&#xD;
river.&#xD;
"From the Western cliff there springs a torrent that with&#xD;
many a leap, and fall, and rebound, tumbles tumultuously&#xD;
down the side of the mountain, and falling into a channel at&#xD;
the foot of the lawn, flows calmly on, until it meets a second&#xD;
fall, from whence it goes hurrying on, through. forests, fields'&#xD;
and rocks, taking tribute from many ~Vmountain-torrent, and&#xD;
many a meadow-stream, and widening 'as it goes, until it be-&#xD;
comes a mighty river, rushing on, to pour its floods into the&#xD;
majestic James. After which, they both 'go on, breaking&#xD;

&#xD;
through range after range of mountains, and so conquer their&#xD;
passage to the- sea-even as in the feudal days of the olden&#xD;
country, some mountain chieftain, gathering his vassals to-&#xD;
gether, came rushing down from his highland home, and&#xD;
laying all the country under tribute in his course, hurried on&#xD;
to throw all his treasures at the feet of his sovereign, and go&#xD;
with him to the wars."&#xD;
"Clifton !" said Fairfax, more seriously than he had yet&#xD;
spoken, "all your illustrations-all your metaphors-all&#xD;
your thoughts, fancies and imaginings are-not' of the earth,&#xD;
earthy,' but worse-far worse-of the world, worldly! Of&#xD;
the world, its castes, customs and conventions-~-its pomps,&#xD;
vanities and falsities! You speak of' the grandest, the most&#xD;
imposing-oh! let me call it a~t once, the most magnificent&#xD;
area of mountain-scenery in the hemisphere, with all the&#xD;
earth, below and around, covered with a sea of vapor that&#xD;
rises and falls, rolling from horizon to horizon, like the wives&#xD;
of th~ ocean, and you compare it to a veiled royal bride&#xD;
You describe a mighty mountain-river, rending its passage&#xD;
through the everlasting rocks, overleaping, uprooting, bear-&#xD;
ing down and bearing on all obstacles to its resistless rush&#xD;
towards the sea, ~md you liken it to a chieftain going to pay&#xD;
tribute to a King! Ah, Clifton of Clifton, the beauty, the&#xD;
glory, and the majesty of the earth pleases you, but the&#xD;
'pomp, pride, and circumstance' of the world inspires you!&#xD;
But when was it otherwise with a Clifton, of Clifton ~ 'The&#xD;
spirit of intense worldliness has ever becen their bane and&#xD;
curse-their sin and its punishment!"' he concluded, re-&#xD;
lapsing into his mock-tragic air.&#xD;
Ab! so you ar~ familiar with the popular legend that&#xD;
you have just quoted," said Captain Clifton. "But," he&#xD;
added, with a sarcastic smile, "were Georgia here, I think&#xD;
she could refute the charge, and prove one Clifton, at least,&#xD;
has been guided by any spirit rather than that of 'intense&#xD;
worldliness."'&#xD;
"Georgia?"&#xD;
"I beg her pardon! Mrs. Clifton, of Clifton."&#xD;
"Oh! your aunt! 4i~ut by my soul, Captain, that was a&#xD;
very irreverent way of introducing the old lady! Do young&#xD;
men in your patriarchal part of the country call old gentle-&#xD;
women by their Christian names !"&#xD;

"Old gentlewomen !" repeated Clifton, slowly, with a&#xD;
~ musing smile, adding-" Georgia is about seventeen years&#xD;
~ of age, and the most beautiful woman in the world !"&#xD;
"Whe-e-e-ew! I'm amazed! I'm confounded! I'm&#xD;
stunned! Then-the present Mrs. Clifton is the second wife V'&#xD;
"No, sir-Georgia is my uncle's fourth wife."&#xD;
" Overwhelmed !-annihilated!" exclaimed the young man.&#xD;
"The- the-old Blue-beard! the old Henry VIII.! Four&#xD;
wives! Are they all living ~-if not, where does he bury his&#xD;
dead ~"&#xD;
"Fairfax!" exclaimed Captain Clifton, in a tone, and&#xD;
with a look, that speedily recalled the young man to himself&#xD;
-then he added, rather haughtily-" My Uncle Clifton is a&#xD;
simple, gentle-hearted old man, excessively fond of women,&#xD;
but mark you, sir !-it is the affection of the patriarch, not&#xD;
of the pacha."&#xD;
"Hang me if ever I saw any difference between Solomon&#xD;
the king, 'and Solimaun the caliph; Abraham the pati'iarch,&#xD;
and Aroun the pacha, in that respect," laughed the young&#xD;
man, until, stealing a furtive glance at the cold and haughty&#xD;
face of' Clifton, he held out his hand, and suddenly exclaimed&#xD;
-" Pardon me, Clifton! or call me out! I-can't help a&#xD;
jest, to save my soul! but P11 fight or apologize, or render&#xD;
any other sort of satisfaction afterwards !"&#xD;
Captain Clifton remembered that Francis Fairfax was his&#xD;
guest, going to spend a long mid-summer furlough at his&#xD;
mother's house, and so he cleared his brow and answered-&#xD;
"NonsenseP'&#xD;
"Now tell me about Henry VIII.'s fourth Queen-how&#xD;
long has she been married-I mean the present Mrs. Clifton ~"&#xD;
"About two years. My uncle wedded her when she was&#xD;
fifteen-she is now seventeen-and, as I said, the most beau-&#xD;
tiful creature' that you, or I, or any one else, ever did, or&#xD;
ever shall sees anywhere."&#xD;
"./lllons-.stop there! False knight 'and recreant! whose&#xD;
colors do you wear while you uphold the peerless beauty of&#xD;
Georgia ~ What would Miss Clifton of Clifton say to your&#xD;
admiration ~"&#xD;
"Ridiculous, sir! Miss Clifton is herself very beautiful,&#xD;
but not the most beautiful. Miss Clifton has other and&#xD;
rarer distinctioiis, I am proud to say'?"&#xD;

"Oh, I understand-her family mime !-nevertheless, be&#xD;
hanged if I don't believe you have been in love with&#xD;
Georgia !"&#xD;
"Imppssible, sir! The perfect beauty of the young girl&#xD;
struck me forcibly, as it strj~es all others-nay, more-un-&#xD;
pressed my imagination deeply perhaps. I confess to a&#xD;
penchant for female beauty-and-observe-it is the artist's&#xD;
taste, sir, not the sultan's. But in love with Georgia! Im-&#xD;
possible, sir! She was a girl of humble parentage !"&#xD;
"Au! then you think it quite 'impossible' that a gentle-&#xD;
man born, should be in love with a girl of 'humble parent-&#xD;
~&#xD;
"Preposterous, sir !-utterly&#xD;
hear no more about it       preposterous!  Pray, let us&#xD;
"Yet your uncle-"&#xD;
"My uncle married such an one, you would say. Old&#xD;
gentlemen, living on their own estates, will do such things.&#xD;
And the w9rld charitably ascribes it to dotage, smiles and&#xD;
forgives them. You will oblige me by changing the subject)&#xD;
Frank."&#xD;
Fairfax fell into reverie, and Clifton dropped into thought,&#xD;
and they rode on for some time in silence, and in-joy-&#xD;
until-.&#xD;
"Floods and furies! Fire and flames!! Lightning and&#xD;
tempests, and sudden death!! !" exclaimed Fairfax, rearing&#xD;
and backing his horse with a terrible jerk, and throwing him-&#xD;
self from the saddle, bathed in perspiration, and shaking with&#xD;
terror. "Look! Look there! There at your feet! Back!&#xD;
Back your horse, unless you wish to ride straight to the&#xD;
kingdom of Heaven, or-to the other place! Oh, blessed&#xD;
Lord! I shall never survive the shock!"&#xD;
Captain Clifton backed his horse, dismounted, and follow-&#xD;
ing the index of Fairfax, approached the brink of the awful&#xD;
abyss, and looked down a perpendicular precipice of more&#xD;
than a thousand feet, with the remaining distance lost in&#xD;
shadows and dim vapors, while faintly to the ear came a low&#xD;
and hollow murmur, as of the roaring of many waters at a&#xD;
vast depth!&#xD;
"This is the head of the Devil's Staircase! We have lost&#xD;
our way !" said Captain Clifton.&#xD;
"Devil's Staircase! I should think it was! Ugh! Oo-&#xD;
&#xD;
oo-oo-ooh! I shall never survive it! Where does it lead to!&#xD;
Tell mc that! To the infernal regions, I suppose, of course.&#xD;
JJr-r-r-r-r !" exclaimed Fairfax, with his teeth chattering.&#xD;
"We have indeed made a very narrow escape," said Cap-&#xD;
tain Clifton, gazing thoughtfully dowfl the horrible pit.&#xD;
"Narrow escape! Ur-r-r-r-r!" exclaimed Frank, shaking,&#xD;
shuddering, and streaming with cold perspiration. "I tell&#xD;
you, when I was providentially led to lnok down, and saw the&#xD;
fog roll away from beneath my horse's feet, and reveal that&#xD;
ghastly-Ur-r-r"r-r! Ur-r-r"r-r! I believe I shall chatter my&#xD;
teeth to powder !"&#xD;
"Come, come, Fairfax! this is really unmanly. Thank&#xD;
an ever-watchful Providence, that has preserved you from a&#xD;
sudden and horrible death, land calm yourself. Be a&#xD;
man&#xD;
"Be a man! You might as well say to my shuddering&#xD;
horse, there-be a horse!* This is unhorsely! Ur-r-r~r-r!&#xD;
I tell you it has given me the tertian ague !"&#xD;
"Why, Frank! Really !"&#xD;
"Look at my horse-look even at that dumb beast! Yes,&#xD;
look at that gallant steed, who would charge upon a phalanx&#xD;
of fixed bayonets, and impale himself upon their points, if&#xD;
spurred to it-look at him! Positively frozen with terror !"&#xD;
"Fairfax, you astonish me-certainly you are not really&#xD;
so much overcome."&#xD;
"Overcome! My nerves are shattered to atoms, I tell&#xD;
you! Ur-r-r-r-r! It has given me the tertian ague, and&#xD;
the St. Vitus' dance! both together! 1IJ'r-r-r-r-r !"&#xD;

'He wasn't buried-the crows eat him up,' etc., etc., etc.!&#xD;
Oh! I know what my posthumous fame would be in such a&#xD;

Francis Fairfax, who, fifty years hence, at a good old age,&#xD;
shall die in his downy bed, with the archbishop praying by&#xD;

mortal services to his grateful country, in receiving her&#xD;
honors and emoluments for more that half a cent~iry! Can't&#xD;
give up that glorious future for the sake of dashing myself&#xD;
to pieces this afternoon, Clifton. No !" said the young man,&#xD;
folding his arms, and striking an attitude a-la-sYapoleon,&#xD;
"I have a destiny to fulfill, and shall not stir from this spot&#xD;
until the mist rises or falls."&#xD;
"Mr. Fairfax! it is now drawing late in the afternoon. We&#xD;
shall have a storm before night; and a storm on the moun-&#xD;
tains, let me tell you, is a much more delightful thing to read&#xD;
about in Childe Harold, while stretched at your ease upon&#xD;
the settee in your shady piazza, than to take in pro-&#xD;
pria persouw on the Alleghanies," said Captain Clifton,&#xD;
quietly.&#xD;
"Only warrant me from bringing up suddenly to the&#xD;
jumping-off place before I know it-ahd I'll make an at-&#xD;
tempt! Yea! let him only insure my body unharmed by&#xD;
fire or water, and I'll valiantly follow my leader through&#xD;
flood and flame!" replied Frank, recovering himself with a&#xD;
few more shudders, and preparing to mount.&#xD;
"We have left the right road about Iwo miles behind,"&#xD;
said Captain Clifton, turning his hors~head and leading&#xD;
the way.&#xD;
The fog below was condensing very fast. From the North-&#xD;
Western horizon black clouds were rising behind masses of&#xD;
foaming white vapor. The air was still and oppressive, and&#xD;
from all around came a faint, low moaning sound, as if na-&#xD;
ture cowered and frenibled before the coming of the terrible&#xD;
"storm king." The fog was now rolling down and gather-&#xD;
ing info clouds below them-revealing the majestic features&#xD;
of the landscape, mountains, vales and forests, rocks, glens&#xD;
and waterfalls, in wild and magnificent confusion-all wear-&#xD;
ing now a savage and gloomy aspect ~under the shadow of&#xD;
&#xD;
the coining storm. Captain Clifton's eye had been con-&#xD;
stantly on the alert in hope of discovering some mountain&#xD;
cabin, which might shelter them from the fury of the tem-&#xD;
pest, but as yet his search was unsuccessful-no human&#xD;
dwelling even of the humblest description was to be .seen.&#xD;
At length the attention of the travellers was attracted by&#xD;
the faint tingling of a bell-then by the bleating of sheep-&#xD;
and then from ~the deep clouded glen at their right, sprung&#xD;
up into their path a beli-wether followed by two-five-ten-&#xD;
a whole flock of sheep; and driven by a girl on a pony;&#xD;
a little coarse, sun-burned girl, in a boy's coarse straw hat&#xD;
and a homespun gown, riding on a little rough-coated, wiry,&#xD;
mountain pony.&#xD;
"A shepherdess, by all that is romantic," exclaimed Fair-&#xD;
fax, vaulting aside to let the sheep pass. Then springing to&#xD;
the side of the rough-coated pony, he doffed his hat to the&#xD;
rider and said-&#xD;
"My good girl-for the love of Providence, will you tell&#xD;
us ~ivhere we can find shelter from the storm ~"&#xD;
The child raised her fine eyes to the stranger's face with&#xD;
the look of a startled fawn-and dropped them again in-&#xD;
stantly. Fairfax repeated his question. The child stole&#xD;
another furtive glance at the fine gentleman in the very fine&#xD;
uniform, and then at her own coarse raiment, and blushed&#xD;
deeply. But before Fairfax could reiterate his request, she&#xD;
said, quietly-&#xD;
"Grandfather's cabin is not far off, if you and the other&#xD;
gentleman will come with me."&#xD;
"With great pleasure-and ten thousand thanks, my dear&#xD;
little girl. Be so g~pd as to lead the way."&#xD;
The flock of sheephead gone on before. The girl put her&#xD;
pony in motion, and the gentlemen followed-Mr. Fairfax&#xD;
addressing all his conversation to his little companion; and&#xD;
Captain Clifton riding on in silence and abstraction.&#xD;
~Phe sky was darkening very fast, and great single drops&#xD;
of rain occasionally falling. They quickened their pace, and&#xD;
after riding briskly several hundred yards, came to the head&#xD;
of a glen, deep down in Which was seen a small, lone cabin.&#xD;
At this instant the sheet lightning glared from horizon to&#xD;
horizon, followed by a report as. of exploded and falling&#xD;
rocks, and their the rain came down in a deluge. The dark.&#xD;

&#xD;
ness was so dense now as to hide their way. The girl jumped&#xD;
from her pony, and giving him a little slap that sent him&#xD;
travelling down the path, went up to the head of Clifton's&#xD;
horse and said, shyly-&#xD;
"You can't see the way, sir, and you don't know the&#xD;
road-let me lead youi' bo~r~e."&#xD;
"By no means, my good girl," replied Clifton, speaking&#xD;
in a tone of haughty astonishment.&#xD;
Without reply the child turned from him and went to-&#xD;
wards Fairfax. And at the same instant a thunder-bolt was&#xD;
hurled from Heaven with a terrific crash, driving the ground&#xD;
on which she had just stood. When the panic was over, the&#xD;
first thought of Captain Clifton was for the safety of that&#xD;
presumptuous child. A glare of lightning revealed her&#xD;
lying on the rock. He hastened to her side.&#xD;
"My dear child, are you hurt," he asked, dismounting&#xD;
and stooping to lift her.&#xD;
"Oh! sir, I am So glad to hear you speak! I thought&#xD;
you were struck."&#xD;
"Are you hurt ~"&#xD;
"Oh no, sir, I was only thrown down," replied the child,&#xD;
lightly springing to her feet.&#xD;
"Oh, yes! Exchange your mutual condolences and cone&#xD;
gratulations. But who the mischief cares whether I am&#xD;
hurt or not ?" exclaimed Fairfax, stumbling along towards&#xD;
them-for he also had dismounted.&#xD;
" You were entirely out of danger," replied clifton.&#xD;
"Out of danger! Who the deuce is out of danger ~within&#xD;
a hundred miles of these infernal mountains V'&#xD;
The rain was still pouring clown in floods, and in~ the inter-&#xD;
val of the thunder, the roar of the swollen torrents was'&#xD;
deafening. The question now was, whether ~t6 remain stancb&#xD;
ing there exposed to all the fury of the storm, or to attempt&#xD;
the now dangerous descent into the glen.&#xD;
"I could lead your horses down in safety, if you would&#xD;
let me, for I know every inch of the road so well," said the&#xD;
girl.&#xD;
Another blinding glare of lightning, another terrific peal&#xD;
of thunder, and another deluge of rain, put a stop to all re-&#xD;
ply. At last the child repeated her offer, saying that she&#xD;
oould lead the horses down very well, "one at a time." But,&#xD;
&#xD;
of course, that was not for a moment to be thought of by&#xD;
the young men. And her plan was rejected at once.&#xD;
"Well, then, the only way will be to go down on foot,&#xD;
and leave your horses here to follow. For you will need&#xD;
y our hands as well as your feet in groping down the slippery&#xD;
rock through the darkness," said the girl.&#xD;
After a little more consultation, her last proposition was&#xD;
adopted, and they began the descent on foot.&#xD;
After some twenty minutes' toil and struggle through&#xD;
darkness and deluge, thunder and lightning, they reached&#xD;
the lowly door of the cabin, pushed it hastily open, and hur-&#xD;
ried in.&#xD;
It was very dark, and nothing was to be seen but the red&#xD;
glow of a few smouldering embers on the hearth. Towards&#xD;
these the girl went.&#xD;
"And what do you think has become of your flock of&#xD;
sheep, my good girl V' inquired Frank, kindly, remembering&#xD;
her interests while he stood there wringing the water out of&#xD;
his coat skirts.                                A&#xD;
"Oh, the bell-w6 ~her has led them all into the pen long&#xD;
agQ, sir. They are always safe when they are once in the.&#xD;
glen," replied the child, as she lighted a candle.&#xD;
The sudden glare of the light showed a rude apartment,&#xD;
with an earth floor, log walls, and a fire-place of unhewn stone.&#xD;
On the right of the fire-place stood a poor bedstead, upon&#xD;
which lay a venerable, white-haired old man, covered with a&#xD;
faded counterpane, and near the bed sat an old, chip-bot-&#xD;
tomed arm-chair. On the left of the fire-place were two&#xD;
rough plank shelves, the lower shelf adorned with a few&#xD;
pewter plates and mugs; the upper one filled with-&#xD;
books !~.-piles of old dingy, musty books; and near these&#xD;
shelves stood a spinning-wheel, with a broach of yarn on the&#xD;
spindle, and a basket of broaches under it. At the opposite&#xD;
end of the room, one corner was occupied by a little old oak&#xD;
table, and the other by a ladder leading up through a trap-&#xD;
door into the loft overhead. A few rude stools were ranged&#xD;
along the walls, junks of smoked venison, ropes of onions,&#xD;
bunches of dried herbs, hanks of yarn, and the old man's old&#xD;
hat and coat garnished the walls. All this was seen at a&#xD;
glance.&#xD;
"Is your grt~&amp;amp;ndfather sick 'P' inquired Frank.&#xD;

~~IIE CURSE ~OF CLfli'TON.&#xD;
&#xD;
The girl turned her eyes wistfully towards the venerable&#xD;
sleeper, and did not reply.&#xD;
"Is your grandfather sick P' repeated Fairfax.&#xD;
The ghild raised her eyes sorrowfully to the face of the&#xD;
young man, and remained silent.&#xD;
"Is be so very~ sick ~" e~wnestly reiterated Frank.&#xD;
"He is not sick, sir," answered the girl, in a low, sad&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"What is the matter with him, then ~" thoughtlessly per-&#xD;
sisted Frank.&#xD;
Without reply, the girl dropped her eyes, and blushing&#xD;
deeply, turned away. Setting the candle down upon the&#xD;
table, she took a pail of water and went up the ladder, and&#xD;
into the loft. After an absence of a few minutes, she re~&#xD;
turned, and said-&#xD;
"If you will go up stairs now, you will find two suits of&#xD;
grandfather's and Carl's Sunday clothes. They are not fine,&#xD;
but they are clean and dry."&#xD;
Our wet and jaded travellers thanked their young hostess,&#xD;
and prepared to accept her offer.&#xD;
"And if," she added, "you would like to rest after so&#xD;
much fatigue, there is a bed."&#xD;
They reached the loft, and found it a small, low place,&#xD;
with a little window, and a little, clean bed. On the bed&#xD;
lay the two suits of homespun, and two coarse towels. And&#xD;
on a sto&amp;amp;l near, sat a pail of water and a tin basin."&#xD;
"I do believe that little girl has given us her own sanc~.&#xD;
tuary. What a dear little thing she is !-so full of courage,&#xD;
and shyness, too! If she were two or three years older, and&#xD;
a great deal prettier, I could fancy myself writing poetry&#xD;
about her," said Frank,&#xD;
Clifton in~de no eGn~ment.-he was engaged in divesting&#xD;
himself of his wet garments, and thinking about-.~N[iss&#xD;
Clifton.&#xD;
When they had refreshed themselves by washing and&#xD;
changing their, dress, Frank threw himself upon the bed,&#xD;
stretched out his limbs luxuriously, and declared that the&#xD;
rustic's clothes were very loose and comfortable, and his own&#xD;
position truly delightful. Captain Clifton walked to the&#xD;
window, and looked out at the storm, which was now&#xD;
abating.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
Frank was already sound asleep.&#xD;
And while Clifton stood at the window, drawing compa-&#xD;
risons between the meanness of the hut in which he found&#xD;
himself, and the magnificence of the mountain scenery around&#xD;
it, he heard-in that small, shelF-like cabin-he could not&#xD;
help hearing-what follows. First a heave and plunge, as&#xD;
if the old man below stairs had started violently from hi~&#xD;
bed and fallen again; and then a fearful, shuddering voice&#xD;
exclaimed, "Kate! Kate! they're coming again! They're&#xD;
after me, Kate! They're on me! They're on me! Save&#xD;
me, Kate! Save me, Kate! Save-"&#xD;
~~Grandfather-dear grandfather," said the soothing voice&#xD;
of the girl, "there is no one here but me-there, there, be&#xD;
quiet-be still; nothing shall hurt you here-nothing can,&#xD;
you know."&#xD;
"Look! Look, Kate! Look! They're not men now,&#xD;
but devils!" A violent plunge, struggles, exclamations of&#xD;
terror and despair which the low, soothing tones and gestures&#xD;
of the poor girl vainly assayed to tranquilize for some time,&#xD;
and then-silence for a few minutes-which wgs again in-&#xD;
terrupted by-" Snakes! snakes, Kate! Snakes! Green&#xD;
snakes! See! see how they dart! They fly! They're on&#xD;
me! They're on me! Help! Help !" And the sound of the&#xD;
maniac laying about him furiously. Captain Clifton started&#xD;
up with the intention of going to the poor girl's assistance-&#xD;
but by the time he reached the head of the ladder, the voice&#xD;
of the child had again calmed the infuriated man.&#xD;
All~was quiet for a quarter of an hour, and then another&#xD;
violent start' and throw that seemed to shake the little hut,&#xD;
and a horrible shriek of-" A dragon! A dragon, Kate! A&#xD;
green dragon belching flame !" Then a succession of violent&#xD;
shrieks and struggles, which aroused Frank, who springing&#xD;
up in bed, exclaimed-&#xD;
"What the deuce is the matter ~ Has the* Major got&#xD;
another fit of mania-a-potU on him V' Then, as all again&#xD;
was quiet, he rubbed his eyes and said, laughing, "I do bew&#xD;
lieve I have been talking in my sleep! I dreamed we were&#xD;
in our mess, and the Major was drunk again."&#xD;
"A "part of your dream was real. The old man bclow&#xD;

&#xD;
"What! and you stating here !~ I must go down and&#xD;
help the girl."&#xD;
"You had better not as yet. She seems to have the pow-&#xD;
er of soothing him. Your presence might, by exasperating&#xD;
him, do more hai~m than good."&#xD;
At this moment another outbreak of fury from the mad-.&#xD;
man caused Frank to spriiig to his feet, and, exclaiming-&#xD;
"I can't let that maniac tear xny dear little hostess to&#xD;
pieces--" rush to the head of the ladder.&#xD;
"I tell you you had best not intrude-his mania seems&#xD;
perfectly harmless to the child."&#xD;
But Frank was at the foot of the ladder; where, however,&#xD;
an impediment met him. The girl, who had just succeeded&#xD;
in again soothing the madman, came and stood before him,&#xD;
saying, "Pray do not come in, sir, just yet."&#xD;
"But, my good girl, I must come in and remain to protect&#xD;
you," gently trying to pass her. She stood her ground&#xD;
firmly; her lips said-&#xD;
"I am not in any danger. I beg you, sir, do not come in&#xD;
yet ;" but her steady and rather threatening glance said---&#xD;
"Do not dare to look upon the old man in his degradation !"&#xD;
Frank tni:ned back, and went and perched himself at the&#xD;
top of the ladder to watch over the safety of the girl, and&#xD;
be ready in case of exigency.&#xD;
lie saw the old man lying, clutching the cover around him,&#xD;
while his terror-dilated eyes glared out like a wild beast's&#xD;
from its lair-all ready for another start and spring! lie&#xD;
saW the girl mix a mug of strong vinegar and water, and&#xD;
take it to him, and the old man grasp and quaff it with fiery&#xD;
thirst; three times she filled the mug, and three times he&#xD;
gulphed its contents with voracity. Then she laid his aged&#xD;
head tenderly down, and went and saturated a clbth with&#xD;
vinegar, and placed it about his burning forehead and tem-&#xD;
ples. Next she took a rustic fan of turkey feathers and&#xD;
stood by him and fanned him until he fell into a sleep, that&#xD;
every moment became deeper and deeper. Finally she gently&#xD;
laid dpwn the fan, sunk upon her knees by the bedside; and&#xD;
bQwed her head upon her clasped hands in silent prayer.&#xD;
At last she arose, pressed a light kiss upon the furrowed&#xD;
brow of the sleeper, and silently went about her household&#xD;
work.&#xD;
&#xD;
From a shed at the back of the house she brought wood&#xD;
and water, made up the fire, filled and hung on the tea-&#xD;
kettle, set an ovell and oven-lid to heat, and again disap-&#xD;
peared through the back door into the sl~ed. In about&#xD;
fifteen minutes she returned with a tray of dough and a pan&#xD;
of venison steaks. She made her dough into a loaf and put&#xD;
it in the oven to bake, and prepari~d her venison steaks to&#xD;
lay upon the coals. She set her table with milk and crean),&#xD;
and butter, brought in, doubtless from a rude, but cool&#xD;
spring-house, near at hand.&#xD;
When all was done, she sat down to knit, seeming to wait&#xD;
the coming of' another-for she often paused and listened&#xD;
with her head turned towards the door, and at length got u~&#xD;
and drew from under the bed a trunk, whence she took an&#xD;
old, well-patched but clean suit of homespun clothes, with a&#xD;
shirt and a pair of socks, and hung them over a chair.&#xD;
Soon after a step was heard without-the door was thrown&#xD;
9pefl, and a thin, dark young man, dressed as a farm laborer,&#xD;
entered. Throwing his coarse hat to the other end of the&#xD;
room, he approached the fire, when seeing the situation of&#xD;
the old man he stopped short, and placing his arms a-kimbo,&#xD;
gaze&amp;amp;on him, exclaiming~-.-.&#xD;
"Drunk again, by        !" and then turned, with an&#xD;
interrogative look, towards the girl.&#xD;
A short wave of the hand-.a quick, distressful nod, and&#xD;
the choking down of a sob, told him that it was so.&#xD;
The young man let down his arms, and with 'a frown of&#xD;
mingled sorrow and anger approached and gazed upon the&#xD;
sleeper.&#xD;
"Have you had much trouble with him, dear Kate V'&#xD;
The same choking sob and quick nod answered him.&#xD;
"Where DID he get the liquor ~ What has he laid his&#xD;
hands on and sold now-any of my books ~"&#xD;
"No! no !.-it was my bonnet-but never mind, I can&#xD;
wear your old hat, you know !.-it doesn't matter for me !"&#xD;
"Well, now, by all that's-"&#xD;
"Hush, hush, Carl! Don't swear-he is our grandfather,&#xD;
you know; and besides," she added, suddenly dropping her&#xD;
voice, "there are strangers up stairs."&#xD;
"Strangers! What strangers ?"&#xD;
"Two gentlemen#who came in here out of the storm."&#xD;

34             THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Umph !" said the young man, dropping himself into the&#xD;
arm-chair, ana falling into deep thought, from which he was&#xD;
aroused by the voice of Kate, saying-.&#xD;
"Carl, don't sit down in your wet clothes; take those on&#xD;
the chair, and go in tbe shed and pi4 them on. And make&#xD;
haste, p~ease,~ Carl, because, supper is nearly ready, and the&#xD;
L                  gentlemen up stairs must be hungry."&#xD;
The young man arose, with a heavy sigh, saying-&#xD;
"I'll only change my jacket, that, I can do here. Oh&#xD;
Kate !" he continued, as he divested himself of his wet jacket,&#xD;
and drew on the other-" Oh! Kate! what between one thing&#xD;
and another this is no home for you! Indeed, indeed, every&#xD;
I               morning J go away from you with a heavy heart, and all day&#xD;
long I can hardly work for the di~ead that's on my mind&#xD;
about yaw If I could only find a place for you to wait on&#xD;
some lady, or to' nurse a baby-but, Lord! what with th~&#xD;
there is never a place to be got here for a poor white&#xD;
plao:tos:w-Iwouldn't leave him. Why, Carl,&#xD;
girl."&#xD;
'Oh, Carl, if you could, get me the best place in the world&#xD;
would break his. heart,. He woujd grieve himself to death!"&#xD;
shoul&amp;amp;b&amp;amp; dead! .And-better&#xD;
for you and all 9oncerne4 !"&#xD;
"Oh, don't say so, Carl! Don't say so! Come and look&#xD;
at him, and let the eight ~6ften' your heart to him," said the&#xD;
girl, taking the youth's l~aud, and drawing him to the bed-&#xD;
side. "Look, now, at that poor old wrinkled face-it has&#xD;
not, got very lo~ig to live, anyhow-and see the two or three&#xD;
thin, *hite hairs on his temples-and see the poor, poor&#xD;
withered hands-so helpless! Oh~! I think it is all ~o pi~i-&#xD;
ful. And now see, he is asleep, but how much trouble there&#xD;
is on his poor old face-po, no! don't say ha~l thing~ of&#xD;
him, it cuts me to the heart,! And, C4rl, no matter how bad&#xD;
las- fit may behe never offers to hurt me or anything else.&#xD;
Only terror and horror is aU 'that is on him! He is a gentle,&#xD;
harmless, poor old man. And I always pity him like I pity&#xD;
any one very ill."&#xD;
"Kate! I dare say you think this is all tender-'hear~edness,&#xD;
and you give yourself a great deal of credit for it! But I&#xD;
tell you it's nothing but weakness. 4nd it may be the ruin&#xD;
of you, too, before long~ And now I tell you, Pm going to&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
get a place for you, if I can. Yes, and make you go to it, too.&#xD;
I can do without you-that is, I must do i~rithout you! I&#xD;
can get the breakfast befoi~e I go away in the morning. And&#xD;
I can leave something for the old man's dinner, and come&#xD;
home time enough in the evening to get his supper! And&#xD;
to-morroW I am going down to th9 turnpike gate' to thrash&#xD;
Scroggings, and bring your bonnet home. And I'll tell him&#xD;
if ever he 'lets the old man have any more liquor, I'll kick&#xD;
him round his groggery till he hasn't got a whole bone left in&#xD;
his body. Yes, and Ill do it, too !"&#xD;
Kate was placing the supper on the table, but she 'turned,&#xD;
with the same expression of countenance with which she had&#xD;
stopped Fairfax at the foot of the stairs, and said-~&#xD;
"I should be very Sorry for any violence from you, Oarl.&#xD;
lint of one' thing be sure-do what you may, I will never,&#xD;
never leave our grandfather !"&#xD;
"There! now, whenever you get that hateful Maria Theresa&#xD;
look, I hate you, Katterin! I hate to see strength in we-&#xD;
nien! It don't belong to them, nor grace them, anyhow !"&#xD;
"Strength of ~jfedion does, Carl. But now please call&#xD;
the gentlemen down to supper," said Kate.&#xD;
Carl rapped at the foot of the ladder, and summoned the&#xD;
travellers accordingly.&#xD;
Now, though Fairfax had honorably withdrawn from the&#xD;
trap-dooi~, the moment he found thathis services would not&#xD;
be required, and that the conversation between Kate and&#xD;
Carl was growing confidential, yet every word of that conver-&#xD;
sation had been distinctly heard by both young men, and had&#xD;
produced an effect upon both. Frank with difficulty withheld&#xD;
himself from exclaiming aloud, as pity, disgust, anger or ap-&#xD;
probation moved him in turn. Captain Clifton, far less un-&#xD;
pressible, and moi~e reserved than his companion, had re-&#xD;
mahied perfectly quiet and silent, though his thoughts were&#xD;
more practically busy with the case 'than those of his' com-&#xD;
panion. They went down, and wei~e x~eceived at the foot of&#xD;
the ladder by Carl, Who, with a sort of rough politeness,&#xD;
placed stools at the table, and~ invited them to be seated.&#xD;
They placed themselves at the board, at the head of which&#xD;
Kate already presided, with folded hands and downcast eyes.&#xD;
Then to their utter astonishment, the rude, irreverent young&#xD;
man, Carl, stoodup and asked a blessing, saying, afterwards,&#xD;

that he was no parson, nor no Methodist, but Kate would&#xD;
have it so, and he thought it was best upon the whole, not to&#xD;
oppose females in such notions. And then he began to wait&#xD;
upon his guests.&#xD;
Their supper consisted of good coffee, with cream and ma-&#xD;
ple sugar; good bread, with fresh~ butter and cheese; venison&#xD;
steak and broiled chickens; and lastly, of a dish of baked&#xD;
pears, cold, and a pitcher of milk. Frank was surprised to&#xD;
find such excellence of fare amid the ragged poverty of the&#xD;
mountain cabin; but, on afterwards expressing this,~surprise&#xD;
to Captain Cliftou, he was told by the latter, that such con-&#xD;
trasts were by no means rare. Mr. Fairfax applied himself&#xD;
with zeal to the good things before him, until the sharpness&#xD;
of his appetite was sated, and then lingered long over the&#xD;
meal, conversing with his host upon the state of the country&#xD;
in his region, the climate and soil, productions, market, etc.,&#xD;
and receiving from the young mountaineer the information&#xD;
that there was no great amount of produce about there, ex~&#xD;
cept in the glens, grazing for the cattle, and that the roads&#xD;
were so bad, and the towns and villages so distant, that no-&#xD;
thing was raised for market, except such kind of produce as&#xD;
could walk thither, - to wit: flocks and herds. That bis&#xD;
grandfather, before the infirmities of age had come upon him,&#xD;
had raised herds of kine and hogs, which he drove fifty miles&#xD;
to market every year; but that was some tears ago, when he&#xD;
himself was a child. That now they only had a few sheep,&#xD;
which his sister tended while he was at work on apJktation&#xD;
at the foot of the mountain. In reply to a question Frank&#xD;
put while leisurely using his gold tooth-pick, the young man&#xD;
informed him farther that himself and his sister were of Ger-&#xD;
man and Irish descejit. That the old man, their grandfather,&#xD;
was a German by birthbut had lived nearly seyMnty years&#xD;
in America. That his name was Carl Wetzel, and his only&#xD;
daughter, 'Caterina, had been married tQ an Irish emigrant,&#xD;
of the name of Kavanagh. That they were the parents of&#xD;
himself and sister. Finally, that they had b~en dead nearly&#xD;
Seven years. It was farther ascertained that old Carl Wet-&#xD;
zel had been a man of considerable education; ~nd it was&#xD;
easily seen that Carl Kavanagh had inherited much of his&#xD;
father's Irish quickness of intelligence, and much of his&#xD;
grandfather's German love of knowledge.&#xD;

Frank, on his part, was equally communicative, and, in&#xD;
spite of the haughty reserve 'of Captain Clifton, informed his&#xD;
host that he had come up in that neighborhood for the pur-&#xD;
pose of acting as groomsman at the approaching marriage of&#xD;
his friend, Captain Clifton, of the - Regiment of Ca-&#xD;
vairy, to his cousin, Miss Carolyn Gower Clifton, of Clifton&#xD;
Place. That their journey,~so far, had been rather disas-&#xD;
trous; that they had set out from Washington City on horse-&#xD;
back, but had become so fatigued by the excessiVe heat, that&#xD;
they had been obliged, on arriving at Winchester, to take&#xD;
places for themselves in the stage for Staunton, 'and to hire&#xD;
a man to bring their hOrses after them-riding one and lead-&#xD;
ing the other, and so alternately. That before reaching&#xD;
Staunton, they had been thrown from the stage-without&#xD;
serious injury to themselves, however, and'~had been obliged&#xD;
to walk some ten miles to a village on their route, and wait&#xD;
the arrival of their horses, which, fortunately, were not&#xD;
many hours behind them. That they had ridden all day in&#xD;
a thick fog, lost their way, came near going over a fearful&#xD;
precipice, and finally got caught in the tempest that drove&#xD;
them for shelter to the cabin.&#xD;
During all this time, Captain Clifton had seemed lost in&#xD;
thought, and only once spoke to inquire of the young moun-&#xD;
taineer whether it were possible for them to pursue their&#xD;
journey that night. To this the young man replied that it&#xD;
would be impossible, even if it were then daylight, inasmuch&#xD;
as the torrents were swollen so greatly. And at the thought&#xD;
of pursuing their journey, a pang of remorse for his for-&#xD;
getfulness of his horses shot through the breast of Frank,&#xD;
and-&#xD;
"What the devil can have become of Saladin ~" he ex-&#xD;
claimed, starting up.&#xD;
"Oh, he is safe," answered Clifton., "I ~saw them&#xD;
both in the shed. as I looked from the little window up&#xD;
stairs."&#xD;
"Who put them there ~"&#xD;
"I tended them," answered the girl, quietly.&#xD;
They all-now arose from the table. The girl cleared the&#xD;
hoard, and carried all the things out to wash up. Carl&#xD;
begged his guests to excuse him, and went out 1o give the&#xD;
horses a rub down and another feed.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
Captain Clifton threw himself into the arm-chair) crossed&#xD;
his legs, took out his tablets, and began to make memoran-&#xD;
dums.&#xD;
Frank irupertineutly peeped over l~is shoulder and read.-..&#xD;
"Mem. Ask my mother if she can take a little girl as a&#xD;
companion." Clifton closed tI~ book instantly, in silent&#xD;
rebuke of Frank~'s impudence. And Frank himself walked&#xD;
about fidgety and unhappy for not knowing what to do with&#xD;
himself, until, at a restless movement of the old ~nan, he went&#xD;
and poured out a mug of water, and carefully keeping be-&#xD;
hind the eye of the patient, lifted up his head and gave him&#xD;
drink, and after setting down the empty mug, fanned him till&#xD;
he went sound asleep again.&#xD;
The brother and sister soon returned. Carl sat down and&#xD;
begun his best efforts at entertainment. But Frank, who&#xD;
amused himself by seeing everything, saw Kate go up stairs&#xD;
into the loft and bring down and carry out his own and his&#xD;
friend's regimefitals.&#xD;
After which she camein, and drawing a stool to the table,&#xD;
sat down and began to knit, as quietly, as silently, as if no&#xD;
strangers were in her hut.&#xD;
Carl took down and laid upon the table a rough draught&#xD;
board, and invited his gues1~s to play with each other.&#xD;
Frank eagerly caught at the opportunity, but Captain&#xD;
Clifton declined, on the plea of distaste to the amuse-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"Play with me, my dear fellow, for pity sake," said&#xD;
Frank to Carl, "and don't mind my friend there! You see,&#xD;
he doesn't want to play, neither does he want to talk, nor to&#xD;
do anything but sit and think about Miss Clifton."&#xD;
"Do play with him, and keep him quiet, if you can, my&#xD;
good youth," said Captain Clifton, turning his cJ~ajr slightly&#xD;
aside from the table, so that his face was in the .4hade. Op..&#xD;
polite to him, at the other corner of the table, sat Katherine,&#xD;
with the light shining full upon 9lier face and head, as she&#xD;
bowed it over her work. Captain Clifton did not fall into a&#xD;
brown study, he fell into a study of the brown girl. Let no&#xD;
one presume to misinterpret him. It was not likely that a&#xD;
man of twenty-five should fall in love with a girl of four-&#xD;
teen9 Dotards do such things, not men. Then it was&#xD;
Utterly preposterous to suppose that Archer Clifton, of&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CUR8~ OW CLIFT0~?.&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
Clifton, Captain in the Regiment of Cavalry, the fasti-&#xD;
dious amateur in female beauty, should be smitten with a&#xD;
hard-featured, sun-burned girl, in a coarse, homespun frock;&#xD;
that the all-accomplished scholar should be-charmed with&#xD;
~ the little ignoramus; that the arrogant conservative of rank&#xD;
should condescend tc~ a low-born mountaineer; or that the&#xD;
expectant bridegroom of the beautiful and haughty Carolyn&#xD;
Clifton, of Clifton, should wish ~o marry a girl who united&#xD;
all these repulsive qualities of ignorance, ruggedness, and&#xD;
low-birth. Yet if he could have looked only two short years&#xD;
into the future!&#xD;
But Clifton was a physiognomist,~and liked to study a&#xD;
novel individuality. A new and very curious subject was&#xD;
before him now. At first he had seen in Kate nothing more&#xD;
than a coarse-featured, dark-skinned country girl. Now, as&#xD;
he sat and watched ber at her quiet work, with her counte-&#xD;
nance in the repose of thoughtfulness, he saw that her fea-&#xD;
tures, though certainly not beautiful or classical, were even&#xD;
of a higher order of physiognomy, combining the rarest&#xD;
elements of power and goodness. The broad and massive&#xD;
forehead, straight nose, and square, firm jaws, were the strong&#xD;
and ugly features-the rugged frame work, as it were, of her&#xD;
countenance, and indicated great force of character. But&#xD;
her hair, eyes, and lips were beautiful. Her hair, of rich&#xD;
dark brown, with golden lights, rippled around her forehead,&#xD;
shading and softening its stern strength. iler eyes, large&#xD;
and shadowy, with drooping lashes, and her lips sweetly&#xD;
* curved, full, and pensively closed, suggested a profound depth&#xD;
of tenderness. Indeed the brooding brow, the downcast eyes,&#xD;
and the compressed lips seemed to be habitual with her, and&#xD;
gave her countenance an expression of grief and care beyond&#xD;
her years, and of thought and intellect above her station. As&#xD;
Clifton sat and studied her, he thought-not of&#xD;
"Full many a flower that's born to blush unseen,&#xD;
And waste its sweetness on the desert air,~~&#xD;
forthe girl did not resemble a flower so much as a hardy,&#xD;
pine sapling of her native mountains. No; that look, strength,&#xD;
intellect, and self-balance-in a word-that look of POWER,&#xD;
suggested -rather-girl as she was-&#xD;

It was a Maria-Theresa face without the wickedness.&#xD;
Captain Clifton's physiognon~ioal studies were. interrupted&#xD;
by the abrupt starting of Frank, who exclaimed vehe-&#xD;
mently-.&#xD;
"Beaten in four games! Now, that's what I call out-&#xD;
rageous! Don't you know, my dear fellow, that there are&#xD;
three persons in the world who should never be 'beaten-a&#xD;
guest, a woman, and a monarch ~"&#xD;
Carl laughed and chuckled, and beating the draught-boai~d&#xD;
tamborine-like above his head in triumph, carried it off and&#xD;
put it away.&#xD;
The whole party then arose to retire. Carl took the&#xD;
candle and showed his guests up into the loft and left them&#xD;
to repose.&#xD;
"Now Where will that child sleep, for we have got her&#xD;
room ?" asked Frank, with concern, as soon as they were&#xD;
alone.&#xD;
"Oh-h!" replied Captain Clifton, indifferently, "any-&#xD;
where-on a pallet-perhaps, down stairs."&#xD;
"But the old man and the young one-"&#xD;
"Oh-h !" again drawled Clifton, in a bored tone, "if you&#xD;
expect to ni~et with refinement among the mountain people,&#xD;
you will be disappointed"&#xD;
Long after the travellers had laid down to rest, they heard&#xD;
the sound of 'footsteps movii~g about in the room below.&#xD;
They moved quietly and cautiously, as if fearful of disturb'&#xD;
ing the guests; but, as I said before, all sounds, even the&#xD;
lowest, could be distinctly heard through tht~t shell of a&#xD;
house.&#xD;
On awaking the next morning, the young men found their&#xD;
own clothes well cleaned, dried, and pressed, ready for them&#xD;
to put on.&#xD;
"Ah, ha !" said the sagacious Frank, "that is what the&#xD;
poor girl was at work at so late htst night."&#xD;
On going down staii~ they found the lower room neatly&#xD;
~4 arranged, and breakfast ready for them-hot coffee, corn&#xD;
~ pone, hot rolls, rashers of fried bacon, eggs, potatoes, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;

Some CROMWELL guiltless of his country's blood."&#xD;
&#xD;
/ \',,,&#xD;
&#xD;
40&#xD;
&#xD;
And there, in the arm-chair, in a clean homespun suit, sat&#xD;
the old man, looking as calm, as seJ.f~possessed, as noble and&#xD;
venerable as a Roman senator. He arose and bowed to the&#xD;
gentlemen~ and offered his chair to one of them,&#xD;
No wonder it bowed the young girl's head with grief' and&#xD;
shame-it pained and humbled even these strangers, to know&#xD;
that~ this most reverend white-haired patriarch was often&#xD;
transformed by drunkenness into the beast! It was a dis-&#xD;
ease, Kate had often said, wringing her hands with anguish,&#xD;
while seeing his degradation.&#xD;
It was a disease, and never till vice is treated as such, will&#xD;
an effectual remedy be applied.&#xD;
Immediately after breakfast, the gentlemen took leave ot~&#xD;
the family, and mounted their horses to pursue their journey.&#xD;
Frank, in the thoughtless kindness of his heart, would have&#xD;
offered the poor people some remuneration for their enter-&#xD;
tainment, but Clifton, who knew the ~habits and feelings of&#xD;
the mountaineers better, arrested a purpose that might have&#xD;
given offence. But on parting with Carl Kavanagh, Captain&#xD;
Cjifton expressed his thanks for the hospitality that had been&#xD;
extended to himself and friend-adding, that if he could&#xD;
then, or at any time, in any uiaiiner, be of use to his kind&#xD;
host, he should be happy to serve him, etc., etc. To this the&#xD;
young man replied-&#xD;
"I thank you, sir. I know Captain Clifton by report, and&#xD;
feel that I can trust to his generosity~ I have a heavy care&#xD;
-my young sister. If you could hear of a place at service&#xD;
for her among the honorable ladies of your family or acquain-&#xD;
tance, I. should feel very grateful indeed, sir.&#xD;
Captain Clifton kindly gave his promise to make inquiries.&#xD;
Frank again shook hands with Carl, bowed to Kate, nodded&#xD;
to the old man through the window, and then the travellers&#xD;
turned from the door of the niountain hut, cantered briskly&#xD;
up the glen, and took the road to WrnTE CLIFFs.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
&#xD;
CLIFTON AND THE BEAUTIES.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE torrents had been so terribly swollen and overflowed,&#xD;
and the roads so dreadfully washed and guttei~ed by the tem-&#xD;
pest and flood of the preceding evening, that the travellers&#xD;
found the greatest difficulty in pursuing their journey, often&#xD;
having to turn back miles on this road to take another way,&#xD;
and often being obliged to search leagues up, and down the&#xD;
course of a river, to find a practicable ford.&#xD;
Therefore it was near night-fall when they crossed the la~st&#xD;
range of forest-crowned mountains, and descended into the&#xD;
wooded valley that lay between them and White Cliffs. A&#xD;
winding road through the woods brought them to the house.&#xD;
The full moon was rising East of the cliffs, and casting~their&#xD;
shadow back across the house and lawn. The mansion was&#xD;
a lofty edifi!,e of white stone, with terraced roof, and many&#xD;
irregularpprojecting wings. The tall trees surrounding the&#xD;
buildings, the lofty cliffs rising behind them, the dark shadow&#xD;
falling on all; 4he hour, the silence, and the solitude, gave&#xD;
an air of refreshing coolness and deep repose to the scene.&#xD;
On turning an angle of the building, they saw the drawing-&#xD;
room windows open, and the light from them gleaming out&#xD;
cheerfully across that part of the lawn. At that moment a&#xD;
servant, waiting at the hall door, came down to take their&#xD;
horses.&#xD;
~" All well at home, Dandy ~" inquired Captain Clifton, as,&#xD;
he dismounted, and threw him the reins.&#xD;
"Sarvint, sir! All very well," replied the man2 toueiing&#xD;
his hat.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.,&#xD;
&#xD;
Captain Clifton led the way up into the hail adjoining the&#xD;
drawing room, where they were met by an old gentleman,&#xD;
who seized both of Clifton's hands, and shook them slowly&#xD;
and cordially, as he said, dropping each word separately,&#xD;
with a hearty, luscious emphasis-&#xD;
~ glad I am-to see you!"&#xD;
"And I am very happy to 1~ with you, sir; and to find&#xD;
you ~looking so well. Allow 4'e to introduce to your ac-&#xD;
quaintance-JAeute ~t Fairfax, of my company," said Cap-&#xD;
tain Clifton, prese ~ his friend.&#xD;
"Glad to see hi ~. ~YUad to see Mr. Fairfax! Glad to&#xD;
welcome any fria~ ~f~my nephew's to Clifton. How do you&#xD;
do, sir ~ KneW~ yo~ir relative, Lord Fairfax, of Greenway&#xD;

"Oh, a change of dress, by all ~ suggested Frank.&#xD;
"Dandy-DANDY !" exclaimed the 61d gentleman, raising&#xD;
his strong' voice, till the servant appeared, "show Mr.&#xD;
Fairfax to General Washington's room."'&#xD;
General Washington had slept one night at Clifton, and&#xD;
from that time to this, the room he occupied has been&#xD;
"General l,~Tashington~s room."&#xD;
The servant conducted Mr. Fairfax up stairs. And then&#xD;
the old gentleman, turning to his nephews took his hands&#xD;
again, and said-&#xD;
"My dear boy, once more I must say, I'm-..-~o-giad-to&#xD;
-see you! You are at home, you know. So go ~nd find&#xD;
your room, and ring and give your orders, my son, for you&#xD;

Half an hour sufficed the young gentlemen to&#xD;
selves presentable. At the end of which time they descended&#xD;
the stairs,, and were met in the hail by old Mr. Clifton, who&#xD;
ushered them into the drawing-room.&#xD;
This apartment was a most delightful summer room. It&#xD;
was very spacious, occupying the whole first floor of one&#xD;
of those irregular wings of the house. The ceiling was lofty,&#xD;
the walls were covered with pearl white paper, and lhe floor&#xD;
of white oak was waxed and polished to an, ivory sm9oth-&#xD;
ness. On three' sides were tall windows, reaching t&amp;amp; the&#xD;
floor, and opening out upon the piazza or the lawn, and&#xD;
draped with snowy, flowing curtains. On' the fourth side.&#xD;
wa~ the open fire-place, whitened inside, and having on its&#xD;
marbk hearth an alabaster vase of lilies, whose fragrance&#xD;
filled the air. The walls were adorned with tall mirrors, and&#xD;
with choice paintings, all of a cool, refrigerating character,&#xD;
such as: An Alpine Scene, A G~een Forest Glade, with&#xD;

&#xD;
:Deer Ileposing, A Mountain Lake, A Shaded Pond, with&#xD;
Cows, A Farm Yard in a Snow Storm, etc. A piano stood&#xD;
at the farthest end of the room. A harp reclined near it.&#xD;
A few marble-topped stands and tables, scattered~ over with&#xD;
rare prints, books, virtu, bijouterie, etc., stood at convenient&#xD;
distances. A lady's elegant work-table, with its costly tri-&#xD;
fles, was a pleasing feature in the room. Sofas, ottomans,&#xD;
divans, and lounging chairs, "fitted to a wish for study or&#xD;
repose," were everywhere at hand.&#xD;
Through the open windows came the evening wind, laden&#xD;
with the fragrance of flowers, the murmur of falling waters,&#xD;
the whisper of leaves, and the cherry chirp of insects-&#xD;
those night songsters who begin when the birds go to sleep.-.&#xD;
nature's vesper choir. While from the open windoWs could&#xD;
be darkly seen the tall shadowy trees, the towering white&#xD;
cliffs, and, in the distance, a bend of that great river which&#xD;
took its rise here, and which there sleeping among the dark&#xD;
green hills, with the moon shining full upon it, seemed a re-&#xD;
splendent mountain lake, flashing back the moonbeams from&#xD;
its bosom in rays of dazzling light. The whole effect of&#xD;
the room and the scene was delightfully cooling and re-&#xD;
freshing.&#xD;
When Mr. Clifton conducted his guests into this saloon,&#xD;
it was occupied by three young ladies, who, immediately on&#xD;
their entrance, arose to receive them; and whom, in present-&#xD;
ing his visitors, Mr. Clifton severally named as, My wife,&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton,-my daughter, Miss Clifton, and my second&#xD;
daughter, Zuleime. Captain Clifton, in turn, saluted his aunt&#xD;
rind cousins. Miss Clifton, his betrothed, received him with&#xD;
cold hauteur.&#xD;
So, these were the heauties-.-and beautiful, passing beau..&#xD;
tiful, they were indeed, though differing from each other in&#xD;
beauty, as "' one star differs from another in glory." But&#xD;
let me describe them.&#xD;
Carolyn Clifton is tall and elegantly proportioned, and&#xD;
moves with high-bred dignity. Her features are Grecian.-.&#xD;
her complexion is dazzlingly fair, save when the pure rich&#xD;
blood mantles in her cheek, and crimsons the short and scorn-&#xD;
ful lip. Her eyes are blue, and half veiled by their fair&#xD;
lashes, as in disdain of aught that might seek their glance.&#xD;
Her fair hair is carried up from her forehead, and falls~ in&#xD;

bright tendril-like curls around the back of her neck) lend-&#xD;
ing an intellectual and queenly grace to the proud hea~i.&#xD;
The costume of that day closely resembled the prevailing&#xD;
mode of our own. Miss Clifton wore a dress of pale blue&#xD;
silk, made low in the neck, with a long-waisted stomacher,&#xD;
tight sleeves reaching to the elbows, and ample flowing skirt.&#xD;
The neck was trimmed with a fall of deep lace, then called&#xD;
a "tucker," and answering to the present bert/us. The tight&#xD;
half-sleeves were trimmed~ at the elbows by deep lace ruffles,&#xD;
shading the arm. A necklace of large strung pearls aronnO&#xD;
her throat, a bracelet of the same on her arm, and a pearl-&#xD;
headed pin run through the Grecian knot of ringlets at the&#xD;
back of her head, completed her toileL She carried in hei&#xD;
hand and toyed carelessly with a beautiful fan of marabout&#xD;
feathers. She was the daughter of the first Mrs. Clifton, of&#xD;
Clifton, a fair, proud Maryland lady, one of the haughty&#xD;
Gowers, who lived long enough to augment by precept and&#xD;
example, the double portion of family arrogance Carolyn&#xD;
Clifton had inherited from both sides of her house. Miss&#xD;
Clifton had "received her education" at a first-class "La-&#xD;
dies' Institute" at Richmond.&#xD;
Zuleime, the younger sister, was about fourteen years of&#xD;
age, but well grown and full-formed for her years. She was&#xD;
the daughter of the second Mrs. Clifton, a beautiful West&#xD;
Indian Creole, who died in giving her life. Sbe had the&#xD;
snowy skin and damask cheek of her father's fair race,&#xD;
and the glittering black hair and sparkling black eyes of her&#xD;
Creole mother. Her dress was of plain 'white muslin, with&#xD;
short sleeves and low neck, and coral necklace, which well&#xD;
set off the exceeding brilliance of her complexion. Zuleime&#xD;
was home for the mid-summer holidays.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton, of Clifton, Georgia!&#xD;
"Yes, she is indeed the most beautiful woman in the whole&#xD;
world," exclaimed Fairfax, to himself, as he turned from the&#xD;
fair and dignified Carolyn-the brilliant and sparkling Zu-&#xD;
leime, to the dark and graceful. Georgia. She is of medium&#xD;
height~. Her complexion is a rich, dark, uniform olive, her&#xD;
very cheeks being of the same hue, but so transparently clear1&#xD;
that that which would mar the perfection of another face,&#xD;
adds deeper' beauty to hers. Yes! the delicate bloom of&#xD;

liant Zuleim'3, seem common-place beside the perfect beauty&#xD;
of the 'pure, clear olive cheek of the dark Georgia. Hex&#xD;
hair is intensely black, with depths under depths of dark..&#xD;
ness, lurking in the labyrinths of irregular curls that cluster&#xD;
around, and throw so deep a shadow over her witching face.&#xD;
Her eyebrows are black and arched. Her eyelashes are long,&#xD;
black, and drooping. her eyes are-pause-I have been&#xD;
trying to think of something to which her wondrous eyes&#xD;
may be 'compared, for darkness, profundity and power. Mid-&#xD;
night? No, her eyes are darker, stiller, and more solemn&#xD;
yet. Thunder clouds'? No, for her eyes are more stormy&#xD;
and impending still-and their electric stroke is silent as it&#xD;
is fatal. In short, her eyes resemble nothing but themselves.&#xD;
Her dress is of black gauze, over black silk, made high to&#xD;
veil her neck, and finished with a narrow black lace, within&#xD;
which gleams around her throat a necklace of jet and gold.&#xD;
She wears no other jewelry. A large black lace mar~tilla is&#xD;
carelessly thrown over all.~ When she moves her every&#xD;
movement is undulating grace-her motion might be set to&#xD;
music. And when she sits still she is so still, and dark, and&#xD;
beautiful-and something else, besides, that the gazer expe-&#xD;
riences something like the fascination and terror one feels in&#xD;
looking down the' depths of a dark chasm.&#xD;
She was the daughter of a portrait painter in Richmond,&#xD;
and this was what Captain Archer Clifton, in his arrogance,&#xD;
called humble parentage. Mr. Clifton had met her under&#xD;
the following circumstances: On finally withdrawing his eld-&#xD;
est daughter from school, he wished, befoic carrying her&#xD;
home, to have her portrait taken, and went for that purpose&#xD;
to the stadjo of Mr. Fuller, portrait and miniature painter,&#xD;
where he chanced to see her for the first time, the artist'~&#xD;
beautiful child, Georgia. He took so strong a fancy to this&#xD;
bewitching creature, that he delayed his departure-prolong-&#xD;
ing his stay in the city for three weeks, at the end of which,&#xD;
besides the accomplished Miss Clifton, with her elegant&#xD;
wardrobe, splendid jewels, costly presents, and finished por-&#xD;
trait-he took home the artist's daughter as the fourth Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton, of Clifton, much to the indignation of the haughty&#xD;
Carolyn, who never ceased to treat her beautiful young step-&#xD;
mother with scorn and contempt.&#xD;

requested his nephew to lead in his wife, while ho himself,&#xD;
took the arm of his eldest daughter, and left Zuleime to Mr.&#xD;
Fairfax. They crossed the hall and entered a large and&#xD;
pleasant dining-room, where stood an elegant table, laid with&#xD;
a damask table-cloth, set out with silver plate, and Seyres.&#xD;
porcelain, and laden "with all the luxuries of the season."&#xD;
Waiters of perfect dress and address were in attendance.&#xD;
"I assure you, Miss Zuleime, that contrast is all the sea-&#xD;
soning of existence-and this is a high seasoning. For yes-&#xD;
terday we sat down to eat supper off of pewter plates, on a&#xD;
bare board, in a mean hut, in company with rude moun-&#xD;
taineers, and to-night' we sit at the elegant tea-table of&#xD;
Clifton, surrounded with beautiful, refined, and accomplished&#xD;
ladies," said Frank, as he' handed his 'lively companion into&#xD;
her chair, and took the seat by her side.&#xD;
The sprightly Zuleime laughed, and said she doubted~&#xD;
whether he would find more substantial or savory fare here&#xD;
than he got at the moi~ntain-hnt.&#xD;
After all were seated, and all served, the conversation'&#xD;
became general and vivacious-old Mr. Clifton being evi-&#xD;
dently "the life of the company." He chatted, jested,&#xD;
laughed, told anecdotes, and finally, inspired Frank, who&#xD;
gave a laughable description of their adventures on the Alle"&#xD;
ghanies; of being upset in the stage-coach, and pitched into&#xD;
Wolf's Lick; of being lost in the fog, and near going down&#xD;
the Devil's Staircase; finally, of being caught in the tempest,&#xD;
and shut up in a mountain-hut with a raving maniac. At&#xD;
this the old gentleman began to rally his proud daughter on&#xD;
her gratuitous ill-humour of the preceding evening, at the&#xD;
said delay, and then to scold the young men for their effemi-&#xD;
nacy aiid want of gallantry, courage, in suffering themselves&#xD;
to be deluged by the, storm. Now, to be charged, all at&#xD;
once., with effeminacy, and want of gallantry, and courage,&#xD;
even in jest, was too much~ and in Frank's case, too near&#xD;
the truth to go without reply. So he began vehemently to&#xD;
clear his fame, assuring the assembled company that it was&#xD;
not altogether effeminacy; for that they had been hospitably&#xD;
sheltered in the cabin of a beautiful shepherdess.&#xD;
"Xes," said Frank,.maliciously, "so beautiful that Clifton&#xD;
there couldff't keep his eyes off her, and while I sa~ and&#xD;
played 6heeker8 with her brother, he sat and studied' her&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, what a deal of scorn looked beautiful&#xD;
In the contempt and anger of her lip'!"&#xD;
&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
There are some women who cannot bear jest upon such&#xD;
subjects-who cannot tolerate that their lovers should look&#xD;
with common curiosity-far less gaze with interest or admi-&#xD;
ration "for hours," upon any other young female face. And&#xD;
such a woman was Carolyn Gower Clifton. Captain Clifton&#xD;
knew this, and adoring her above all things, silently wished&#xD;
Frank and the mountain girl both at the bottom of the Devil's&#xD;
Staircase.&#xD;
The old gentleman chatted and laughed; Frank jested&#xD;
and blundered; the sprightly Zuleime sparkled and over-&#xD;
flowed with fun and frolic, and the meal went on merrily~&#xD;
notwithstanding.&#xD;
'When supper was over they adjourned to the airy summer&#xD;
drawing-room, where they distributed themselves according&#xD;
to their several humors. Miss Clifton passed imperiously&#xD;
down the room, and tool( her seat upon a distant divan.&#xD;
Oaptain ~Clifton followed, with a troubled air, and sat down&#xD;

"'Never gazed the moon&#xD;

As 'twere her eyes.'&#xD;
Fact, my dear lady, and I should be guilty of misprision of&#xD;
treason, to conceal it !" laughed Frank, shaking his head at&#xD;
his friend.&#xD;
"Ah-h-h! H-a-a-ah !-are you there, my fine fellow !"&#xD;
chuckled the old gentleman, gleefully rubbing his hands,&#xD;
and pointing his finger at his nephew, greatly ~enjoying his&#xD;
discomfiture.&#xD;
"I assure you, si;," began Captain Clifton, gravely.&#xD;
"Oh! don't assure me! don't assure me! Assure&#xD;

on the low ottoman at her feet. They doubtless thought-&#xD;
if they thought at all-that they were in a very obscure&#xD;
nook. But Frank bad the impertinence to see them. There&#xD;
sat the haughty and scornful girl, with chin erect, lip&#xD;
curled, and eyelids cast down in disdain upon her supplant.&#xD;
And there sat Archer Clifton, with his high, proud face&#xD;
turned up to hers, with an earnest, pleading, passionate&#xD;
gaze!&#xD;
"Now, by the venom of Cupid's shaft !" exclaimed Frank,&#xD;
to himself, "I cannot see what Clifton finds to worship in&#xD;
that arrogant girl. If it were this bright, warm Zuleime,&#xD;
here, now! ]3~~t her! I might really suspect him of being&#xD;
a fortune-hunter, and her of being an heiress, if I didn't&#xD;
know that Archer Clifton is himself the heir of the entailed&#xD;
estate of Clifton, and that if his uncle were to die tonight,&#xD;
he might, if. he pleased, turn all these penniless women out&#xD;
of the house to"morrQw! Can't understand it, for my life!&#xD;
But I suppose the bond of sympathy between them i,~ their&#xD;
name and their pride !"&#xD;
"Do you find talking to yourself a very amusing pastime,&#xD;
Mr. Fairfax," asked Zuleime, touching him on the elbow.&#xD;
"No, my dear, delightful little girl, I don't. What a&#xD;
delightful thing, in a country house, is a beautiful girl of&#xD;
fourteen, home for the holydays-a black-eyed, red-lipped&#xD;
girl, in a white muslin gown and a coral necklace !"&#xD;
"Are your soliloquies as good nature as your converse~&#xD;
tion, Mit. Fairfax," inquired the laughing Zuleinie.&#xD;
"Not quite, ~ afraid, my dear."&#xD;
"Do you know. how to play chess, Mr. Fairfax ~" she&#xD;
asked, opening the chess-board.&#xD;
"I know how to play anything you wish me to play, my&#xD;
love-even the fool !"&#xD;
"Oh! the latter is not so rare or difficult an accomplish-&#xD;
ment," laughed the maiden, taking her seat, and beginning&#xD;
to arrange the chess-men. Frank sat down, and they com-&#xD;
menced the game in earnest.&#xD;
All this time the old gentleman, with his white head and&#xD;
rosy face, and kind smile and glance, had been walking&#xD;
leisurely up and down the floor slowly, robbing his hands&#xD;
with an air of great enjoyment-p~iusing now by the work-&#xD;
table. at which sat his beautiful wife, and gazing on her&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
fondly while he toyed with the elegant trifles of her work-&#xD;
box-then sauntering off towards the chess-table, and patting&#xD;
the head of his "little black-headed darling"-as he called&#xD;
Zuleime-or passing a jest with Frank as he overlooked the&#xD;
game-until the boy came from the post-office somewhat late;&#xD;
when taking the paper he went and ensconced himself in an&#xD;
easy-chair on the opposite side of his wife's work-table, and&#xD;
was soon busied in the perusal of the debate on Mr. Jeffer-&#xD;
son's bill for cutting off entails. Frank felt very much&#xD;
pleased that the old boy, as he mentally called him, was&#xD;
quieted at last, and that he himself had at length an oppor-&#xD;
tunity of initiating his. charming companion into the mys-&#xD;
teries of flirtation, while she imparted to him the secrets&#xD;
of chess.&#xD;
The room was now very quiet. And Frank was soon deeply&#xD;
immersed in his game. Yes-'the room was very quiet, it&#xD;
seemed the sanctuary of domestic love and happiness! At&#xD;
one extremity sat the betrothed lovers, conversing in a low&#xD;
tone, softer than the hum of far-off bees. At the other ex-&#xD;
tremity sat the graceful young' wife, placidly pursuing her&#xD;
quiet work, and seeming more like the darling spoiled child&#xD;
of the old man, her husband, who sat reading by her side,&#xD;
and whose kind eyes~ often wandered from the paper anl&#xD;
rested fondly upon her. About midway of the room, sat&#xD;
Frank and his briglit companion, too deeply interested in&#xD;
their chess to notice the happy lovers, or to observe the quiet&#xD;
contentment of the old man with his beautiful darling. Yes,&#xD;
this room seemed a temple of domestic truth and trust~-of&#xD;
family peace and joy. At least so thought Frank, until&#xD;
raising his eyes from his game, his glance chanced to fall for&#xD;
an instant upon the face of Mrs. Clifton.&#xD;
It might have been the darkness of her surroundings&#xD;
which threw into such strong relief that fearful countenance,&#xD;
for the black dress and flowing black mantilla veiled all her&#xD;
form, while the clustering deep black curls darkly shaded&#xD;
her face. Her form was turned from the table and bent&#xD;
over the arm of the chair-her bosom was heaving, her lips&#xD;
.apart and humid, her nostrils slightly distended, and her&#xD;
eyes, those dreadful eyes, fixed with a passionate, fierce,&#xD;
devouring gaze upon some distant object.&#xD;
Fr~nk impuhively followed the direction of that eonsumin~&#xD;

gaze, to where the betrothed lovers sat 'fully reconciled.&#xD;
Clifton, unconscious of all eyes, but those blue orbs that&#xD;
smiled so graciously upon him, was pressing Carolyn's hand&#xD;
to his lips in an ecstaey of love and gratitude. Frank&#xD;
turned again to Mrs. Clifton. Her countenance had changed&#xD;
as by the passage of a thunder-cloud. Her bosom was still&#xD;
as death. Her brow and cheek was darkened, her teeth and&#xD;
lips. clepehed together, her eyes fixed upon the levers with&#xD;
'the baleful glare of a demon, If the head of the fabled Me-&#xD;
dusa had suddenly met his astonished gaze, he could not&#xD;
have felt a, deeper thrill of horror. And yet it was only a&#xD;
look-~-the look ~f an instant-it came and went like the&#xD;
swift swooping past of a fiend's wing-but the shadow on all&#xD;
things ~eemed to remain. No more did that room seem the&#xD;
blessed retreat of household faith and love-no! a deadly&#xD;
serpent lay coiled among its flowers-a deadly poison lurked&#xD;
in its cup of joy-the shadow of a demon's wing was brood-&#xD;
ing in the air-the house was CURSED!&#xD;
Frank was of a highly honorable nature, but nervous and&#xD;
impressible-he could no longer confine his attention to the&#xD;
game; he misplayed awkwardly-ridiculously. Zuleime&#xD;
laughed at him-and her silver laughter struck almost un-&#xD;
pleasantly upon his ear. He lost the game, and finally,&#xD;
complimenting his young antagonist upon the excellence of&#xD;
her own play-an excellence which he admitted he had not&#xD;
fully brought out-Frank arose from the table and sauntered&#xD;
~ut into the piazza, exclaiming inwardly-" Ugh ! ii believe&#xD;
in Sata~i, since I've seen that woman! Ugh! Whe-ew!&#xD;
Every time I think of her I shall feel hot and smell brim-&#xD;

~ioonlight-.-the distant glimpse of the bend in the river,&#xD;
where it lay like a silver lake among the hills-the divine&#xD;
peace and holiness of nature fell soothingly, refreshingly&#xD;

the piazza for some twenty minutes, he returned, to the par"&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
MRS. CLIFTON~ OF HARDBARGAIN.&#xD;
She is a lady of confirmed honor, of an unmatchable spirit, and de.&#xD;
terminate in all virtuous resolutions; not hasty lo anticipate atfront, nor&#xD;
slow to feel where just provocation is given.-OnAuL~s LAMB.&#xD;
CLIFTON by the morning sunlight! Oh! that I could&#xD;
show it to you as Fairfax saw it from the balcony of his&#xD;
chamber on the morning after his arrival! The whole face&#xD;
QJ the country was very high~ yet even this elevated land&#xD;
was broken into hills and valleys, rocks, and glens. Behind&#xD;
the house 'arose the white cliffs so often mentioned, shutting&#xD;
out the Northern view, but before the house lay the valley&#xD;
in which the plantation was situated, and around that, East,&#xD;
West an~ South, stretched a magnificent panorama, ridge&#xD;
beyond ridge of mountains, covered with gigantic forests,&#xD;
clothed with the richest verdure, rolling on until they gradu-&#xD;
ally faded away in the distance, their forms lost among the&#xD;
clouds of the horizon. It seemed a vast, boundless ocean of&#xD;
greenery, of which the vales and mountains were the stu-&#xD;
pendous waves, charmed to sleep.&#xD;
It was a magnificent solitude. Not a human dwelling to&#xD;
be seen. The planters' mansions-if there were any in the&#xD;
neighborhood, were low in the vales, and hidden from sight.&#xD;
The mountain torrent, as' it came leaping down the side of&#xD;
the cliff, running through the wooded lawn, losing itself in&#xD;
the forest vale, and reappearing as a mountain lake among&#xD;
the distant hills, was a beautiful feature in the landscape.&#xD;
The deep intense blue of the clear skies, the early splendor&#xD;
of the pun-light, the murmur of the breeze among the wav-&#xD;
ing tre~s, the joyous songs of birds, gladdened all the scene,&#xD;
and put to flight Frank's blue devils, long before Dandy'&#xD;
called him to breakfast.&#xD;
The breakfast-table was set in the lawn under the shadow&#xD;
~of the pine elms.&#xD;
&#xD;
The old gentleman, in his suit of cool white linen-the&#xD;
sisters in neat morning dresses of white cambric, and the&#xD;
dark Georgia, in her usual 'dress of black, were assembled&#xD;
on the piazza. They greeted Mr. Fairfax with lively wel-&#xD;
come,. telling him that Clifton li&amp;amp;d not yet made his appear-&#xD;
ance. But even while they stoke, Captain Clifton joined&#xD;
them, and they sat down to breakfast. Those breakfasts on&#xD;
the lawn! How many times in after years, in the sultry&#xD;
heat .of the city hotel, did Fairfax recall them!&#xD;
Soon after breakfast, Captain Clifton invited Mr. Fairfax&#xD;
to accompany him in a ride up the ridge to his mother's&#xD;
farm. And after taking leave of the ladies they set out.&#xD;
They lef1~ the 'house by the back way, and took a winding&#xD;
bridle-path up the side of the cliffs. The day was very fine&#xD;
and cool, and their path was shaded by overhanging trees.&#xD;
It was altogether a delightful ride, and as they went&#xD;
Clifton, who led the way, turned his head around and in-&#xD;
quired-&#xD;
"Frank! what 'instigated you to romance so last night&#xD;
about our sojourn at the mountain hut ~"&#xD;
"Romance ~ I didn't romance, except in saying that the&#xD;
girl was beautiful. I said that for your credit !"&#xD;
"Oh! I ought to be exceedingly obliged to you !"&#xD;
"Yes-I think so, too-but what malicious Puck gave&#xD;
you a love-weed, and fooled you into sitting and studying&#xD;
that ugly little girl's hard face all the evening ~"&#xD;
"I did not think 'her ugly at all. She has a noble coun-&#xD;
tenanqce. A most noble countenance. One, of which an&#xD;
empress might be proud of!"&#xD;
"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! F saw nothing but a&#xD;
mountainous forehead, and a strong portcullis jaw!' 'Noble!'&#xD;
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I said you'd taken the love-powder !"&#xD;
"Yet even you cannot find any but a noble simile in speak-~&#xD;
ing of her 'ugly' features !"&#xD;
"Ah! what will Miss Clifton think of this admiration V"&#xD;
"Sir, Miss Clifton has my deepest homage, and when she&#xD;
is my wife, she will indulge no follies. But, Fairfax, yoa&#xD;
are absurd, and I beg you will abandon this ridiculous con-&#xD;
versation. You know that I have always had a proclivity&#xD;
to the study of character. Nature made me something of a&#xD;
physiognoniist. And if there be any truth in my favGrite&#xD;

&#xD;
Science, that mountain girl's face presented the most extra-&#xD;
ordinary combination of power and goodness I have ever&#xD;
met with."&#xD;
"Oh! then you only studied the maiden as the botanist&#xD;
would study a new plant, the geologist a new fossil, or the&#xD;
naturalist a strange animal ~-.--"&#xD;
-" Or the astronomer a new STAR ~ Precisely, sir! Ex-&#xD;
cept that the human' being is the highest and most absorbing&#xD;
study of all&#xD;
"Really! really! this passes belief-the proud, fastidious&#xD;
Archer Clifton, to be smitten with an ugly mountain girl !"'&#xD;
"Frank! Nonsense-you really anger me. Listen, then,&#xD;
and I will tell you why that cbild-for she is but a child-.-..&#xD;
interested me so much. I saw in her face the signs of won-&#xD;
derfu.l force of character, as yet undeveloped, and I saw in&#xD;
~ll her actions that which corroborated their testimony. I&#xD;
was surprised to find all that in the humble mountaineer,&#xD;
and speculated as to what, in her very humble situation, it&#xD;
might lead. That was simply all !"&#xD;
"And did you'not wish to be a providence to the moun-&#xD;
tain girl, and open a field for so much energy V'&#xD;
"Perhiips such a thought might have presented itself to,&#xD;
my mind. If soit was dismissed at once. A highly gifted&#xD;
man of low birth must have extraordinary talents indeed,&#xD;
Fairfax, really this conversation has taken&#xD;
ud be placed in extraordinary Circumstances, to elevate-&#xD;
above his condition-for a ~girl in such a case it is&#xD;
tone than I designed it should. .Really,&#xD;
character, though very rare among 'the lower&#xD;
classes of society, is yet' not so impossible as t~ excite our&#xD;
wonder.. there are others like Kate Kavanagh-.-"&#xD;
-.-" 1:tow pat you've got her name! Now I bad forgotten&#xD;

"Pooh!   ~say                ie         ey&#xD;
great-.--they live and die, and the world hears nothing ~of&#xD;
them. And talents that might have swayed the eounsels'~of&#xD;
a monarch, and decided the destinies of an ~znpire% have&#xD;
been employed to direct the household ~f a s~e~he~4, and'&#xD;
determine the fate of a sheep! Such is the erd~r of soCiety;&#xD;
and better, far better so, than that its boundaries 'should be&#xD;
thrown down, its ranks intermingled !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"There spoke a Clifton of Clifton ~" said Frank.&#xD;
They 'were now at the top of the ridge, and entering upon&#xD;
a hard, stony, half-reclaimed farm, in the midst of which&#xD;
stood a rude, but substantial house, built of hewn rocks of&#xD;
every shade of gray, and surrounded by trees. Below them,'&#xD;
all around, rose the forest-crowned hills; behind them the&#xD;
white cliffs concealed the mansion of Clifton from their sight;&#xD;
all around them lay fields of stunted corn.&#xD;
"This is Jlardbargain," said Captain Clifton, opening a.&#xD;
rude farm gate, and holding it open, while his companion&#xD;
passed through.&#xD;
"Hardbargain! a most appropriate name! I should think&#xD;
it the hardest of all bargains, to receive this farm as a pre-&#xD;
cious gift," replied Frank, looking around upon the stony&#xD;
held and stunted corn.&#xD;
admitted Captain Clifton," it is a~ell-merited title.&#xD;
once called Rocky Ridge. A poor man got a grant&#xD;
of it, and settled there first.-spent all his health and strength&#xD;
in trying to bring the rugged soil under cultivation-failed&#xD;
'-chri~tened the place llardscrahble, and sold it to my grand-&#xD;
father for thrice its value. My grandfather repented. the&#xD;
purchase, re-christened the ill-starred farm Hardbar~ain,&#xD;
and, as the Clifton estate was entailed upon his eldest son,&#xD;
gave this farm' as a portion to his yo~mger son, my Lather..&#xD;
My father was then a subaltern officer in the Continental&#xD;
Army, and absent with Washington, at Valley Forge. My~&#xD;
mother, with myself, then an infant, was a temporary&#xD;
sojourner at Clifton, No sooner had my grandfather made a&#xD;
gift to my father of this neatly barren farm, than my mother&#xD;
set all her faculties at work for its cultivation and improve-&#xD;
ment. My mother was nearly penniless, being the daughter&#xD;
of a family of decayed fortune. My father was uiiable to&#xD;
send her anything except the Continental notes, with which&#xD;
he himself wa~ paid, but which would scarcely pass farther.&#xD;
But being. determined not to eat the bread of dependence by&#xD;
remaiuing~t Olifton after my grandfather's death~ mymother&#xD;
sold' 'all her jewelry and plate, which had been left her by a.&#xD;
deceased x~iaid1en ai~nt, and applied the proceeds of the sale&#xD;
to thc in~provei~ent of Rardbargain. She' hired laborers.&#xD;
There was a i~ud~ log hut, built by the first settler upon the&#xD;
land. She hired a woman~ and placed her in that hut to&#xD;

keep house and cook for them. She read books on agricul-&#xD;
ture, and consulted my uncle's overseer upon the same sub-&#xD;
ject. And every morning she rode up and spent the day at&#xD;
Ilardbargain, overlooking the laborers. She was her own&#xD;
overseer!' Frank! you appreciate high worth when you see&#xD;
it! I may, besides, tell you anything-you are my only&#xD;
companion-I tell you that my dear mother was one in ten&#xD;
thousand. She was a true heroine, a heroine of domestic&#xD;
lifej 'Abandoning all her habits of elegance and refinement,&#xD;
despising luxury, ease and comfort, disdaining the sneers of&#xD;
the world, and giving herself to toil and hardship, and weari-&#xD;
ness of body and mind, that she might win from the desert&#xD;
an independent home for her family! My dear mother- had&#xD;
no reason to suppose, and never admitted the possibility that&#xD;
my uncle would not be blessed with a male heir, that I, her&#xD;
son, for whom 'she toiled to secure a rugged farm, would be&#xD;
the inheritor of entailed Clifton! And so she toiled, year&#xD;
after year, until at the end of the war, when the army was&#xD;
reduced, and my father came home, he found a comfortable&#xD;
house, and a productive farm."&#xD;
Clifton seemed to have fallen into one of his fits of remi-&#xD;
niscence; scarcely conscious that he was talking to his true&#xD;
but volatile friend, scarcely conscious that he was talking at&#xD;
all, he went on-&#xD;
"My first recollection of my dearest mother, is of a very&#xD;
noble looking lady, of dark complexion, black hair, and gray&#xD;
eyes. II recollect, when an infant of four years old, being&#xD;
brought out from the mansion house of Clifton every morn-&#xD;
ing, to the back road gate, where she sat upon her horse&#xD;
awaiting me, with a little basket, containing our dinner,&#xD;
hanging, on the horn of the saddle. I used to be lifted to&#xD;
the saddle before her, and while her left arm encircled me,&#xD;
with hcr right hand she would guide her horse around the&#xD;
base of the cliff, and take the winding bridle-path that led&#xD;
up the Rocky Rid~, upon which lay her sterile farm of&#xD;
Hardbargain. Oh! I remember how she used ti~ ride from&#xD;
field to field, making investigations, and giving directions to&#xD;
her rude workmen-and with what deference the rough mm&#xD;
were 'ised to address her-hat in hand~ I' remember, too,&#xD;
our cold dinners, taken under the shade~ of ar~ elm free,&#xD;
4.~bbse iowcst branches sheltered a fin&amp;amp; spring--the he~d&#xD;
&#xD;
waters of that very torrent, which, in course of time and&#xD;
space, swells into the mighty river I told you of. Oh! my&#xD;
noble mother! how few would have displayed her courage&#xD;
and fortitude !-not one in a million but would have rather&#xD;
sat down in the luxurious ease and abundance of Clifton,&#xD;
where she had a long welcome for as long as she should&#xD;
choose 4o stay-rather than have dared the toil and hard-&#xD;
ship that she endured. The land was at. last cleared up, the&#xD;
farm laid off in order, and brought under the best possible&#xD;
cultivation. A comfortable house was built, and my mother&#xD;
moved into it to receive my father when he should come&#xD;
home, at the disbanding of his company. He came at last-&#xD;
it was a happy time-and well I remember~ how my mother's&#xD;
young, but 'stern and weather-beaten face, bloomed &amp;amp;~nd&#xD;
softened again into youth and beauty and womanhood, by her&#xD;
soldier's side. But~ ah! he had survived all the horrible&#xD;
perils and sufferings by cold, hunger, and the foe, endured&#xD;
by our army during that long and terrible ~struggle, and re-&#xD;
turned safe, to die in a time of peace-to die at home, where&#xD;
every care and comfort surrounded him. Yes, he came home&#xD;
in the winter of -82. Towards the spring, he took a slight&#xD;
cold-it was neglected as of little account-it settled upon&#xD;
his lungs-before winter came again, he died, and the first&#xD;
snow that fell, fell upon his grave. My honored mother was&#xD;
a strong-minded woman. After what IL have told you, you&#xD;
know that she was! She loved him as only the strong can&#xD;
love. She suffered' as only the strong can suffer. She rose&#xD;
above that death-blow to her happiness as only the strong&#xD;
can rise, But she has never been the same woman since.&#xD;
When a few years had passed, and her son's welfare demanded&#xD;
her care, she aroti~ed every faculty of her mind a4nd body,&#xD;
for -the 'purpose of insuring' his greatest good. Even at&#xD;
that epoch of time, there was no reason to suppose that .1&#xD;
should inherit the Clifton estate. My uncle was then in the&#xD;
prime of manhood, had married his second wife, and by no&#xD;
means despaired of male issue. My dear mother taxed soul,&#xD;
body and estate to the utmost, to defray my expenses at&#xD;
college, luring ..the seven years of my residence there. It&#xD;
was also to her persevering exertions, as well as to ~he late&#xD;
military services of my deceased father, that I owed ~ny com-&#xD;
mission in the army. They say that mi8fortun~s neve ~ p&#xD;

&#xD;
single. Good fortz~ne certainly never does, if I may judge&#xD;
of our own experience of both. When I had left college,&#xD;
the heaviest tax was raised from our income, and when I oh-&#xD;
tamed a commission in the army, nay year's pay more than&#xD;
doubled the annual income from the proceeds of the farm.&#xD;
At this time also .my mother received a legacy from an aged&#xD;
and distant relative, which enabled her. to stock her farm&#xD;
well, and furnish her house comfortably. Furthermore, my&#xD;
uncle having lost his tkird wife, and at last given up all&#xD;
thoughts of a son 'of his own; began to take quite a paternal&#xD;
interest in rae-insisting, when off duty, I should 8pcnd all&#xD;
my time with him-and finding neither myself nor my mo-&#xD;
ther disposed to forego each other's society, ~would have per-&#xD;
suaded the latter to take upcher abode under his roof. But&#xD;
that arrangement did not suit my mother. She, who in her&#xD;
young womanhood had too high a spirit for dependence-&#xD;
preferring to give herself to severest toil and privation, rather&#xD;
than live in easy luxury under another's roof-could not in&#xD;
her stern maturity be bribed to give up her well-earned in-&#xD;
dependence. Nor indeed, under any circumstances, should&#xD;
I have consented to the plan. We compromised the matter&#xD;
by my agreeing to spend half the time of furlough at Clifton.&#xD;
This was the more congenial to my feelings, as my cousin&#xD;
Carolyn had now left school permanently. As for my uncle,&#xD;
he consoled himself for his disappointment in not getting my&#xD;
mother's society at Clifton, by marrying a fourth wife."&#xD;
"I am impressed with the idea that your mother is a very&#xD;
proud woman, Clifton !" said Frank, taking advantage of&#xD;
Captain Clifton's first thoughtful pause.&#xD;
"No, no," he answered, slowly, as in half reverie, "no-&#xD;
sI~e is not what the world calls proud-she is no conservator&#xD;
of rank, as I am. She is the only true republican I know&#xD;
in this whole Republic. Sprung, herself, from an ancient,&#xD;
noble, and haughty race, she yet honors talent and virtue,&#xD;
when met with~ in the lowest ranks, as much-nay, I verily&#xD;
'believe, more, than when found in the highest circles, where&#xD;
it is natural they should be more frequently seen."&#xD;
"But here we are, and you shall judge for yourself,"&#xD;
concluded Captain Clifton, as he opened a 'gate admitting&#xD;
them into a shady yard, in the midst of which.stood the hopse.&#xD;
They alighted at the, gate and gave their horses into theichtu~go&#xD;
&#xD;
of a negro boy, and walked on to the house. It was a plain&#xD;
oblong stone building, of two stories, with a deep, shady&#xD;
piazza, running the whole length of the front. It was divided&#xD;
through the centre by a wide passage, way, the front and&#xD;
back doors of which were both open and drawing a fine draft&#xD;
'of air, and from which opened four large airy rooms, two on&#xD;
a side. They stepped up on the piazza, and were met at the&#xD;
front door by a neatly clothed negro girl, who admitted them&#xD;
into the passage, and opening a door on the right hand next&#xD;
the front, showed them into a ~ol, breezy, but plainly fur-&#xD;
nished parlor; the walls and ceiling being simply white-&#xD;
washed, and the floor bare but highly polished with wax, as&#xD;
was the summer custom of the country at that day. The&#xD;
fire-place was open and filled with green bushes. The win-&#xD;
dow-curtains, and the lounge, and easy chair covers, were&#xD;
all of chintz. There was a reality of substantial and perma-&#xD;
nent comfort about the place, that Frank thought he had&#xD;
never seen elsewhere. And when Clifton invited him to be&#xD;
seated, and he rested himself in one of those cool arm-chairs&#xD;
in that shaded room, he declared that a feeling of at-home-&#xD;
ativeness came over him, such as he had never experienced&#xD;
since he left his own mother's house, and never hoped'to feel&#xD;
again until he should have a house of his own. The negro&#xD;
girl whom Clifton addressed as Hennie, then left the room to&#xD;
summon her mistress, and shortly after the lady of the house&#xD;
entered.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton, of llardbargain, 'was now about fifty years&#xD;
of age-tall, and inclining to en bon point, but not more so&#xD;
than well became her years. Her complexion was dark, arid&#xD;
her hair and eyes black. Her features were strongly marked&#xD;
and commanding, indicative of great strength of will and&#xD;
indomitable firmness of purpose, all moderated, however, by&#xD;
the expression of her countenance, which was at once coim~&#xD;
posed and gracious. Her manner was marked by unaffected&#xD;
dignity and courtesy-her dress was of very plain dark silk,&#xD;
made high to the throat, and with sleeves coming down to&#xD;
the wrists, a small ruff set closely around her neck, fastened&#xD;
with a mourning pin. Her ~only head-dress was her own&#xD;
black hair, which, though slightly mingled with gray, was&#xD;
worn uncovered. Indeed, cap or turban upon that noble&#xD;
head would have looked impertinent. She advaneedi~to the&#xD;

room and greeted her son with affection, and welcomed Mr.&#xD;
Fairfax with courtesy, though her words were so few, and&#xD;
her maimer was so calm, as to seem cool. Frank thought&#xD;
her a very noble looking woman, though somewhat stiff and&#xD;
cold. Indeed, all strangers, and superficial observers, thought&#xD;
her cold and proud. ~Never was a greater misapprehension&#xD;
of character-never did a larger or more generous heart live&#xD;
in the bosom of woman-albeit, its pulsations were of the&#xD;
calmest and most regular character. She sat down and en-&#xD;
tered into an easy conversation with her son and his friend,&#xD;
inquiring into the particulars of their journey, and making&#xD;
conunents as they were related. Once during the recital her&#xD;
cheek almost imperceptibly changed. It was at the telling of&#xD;
the hair-breadth escape at the brink of the Devil's Staircase,&#xD;
but upon that she made no observation whatever. She rang&#xD;
a little hand-bell, which was answered by the entrance of&#xD;
Hennie. She took a bunch of keys from her pocket, and&#xD;
giving them to the girl, directed her to bring refreshments.&#xD;
Ilennie left the room, but soon returned bearing a large&#xD;
waiter with home-made wine, cake, and a basket of fine&#xD;
peaches and pears. While they regaled themselves upon&#xD;
these luxuries, she inquired after the health and well-being&#xD;
of the family of White Cliffs, and having received satisfactory&#xD;
answers, turned to Mr. Fairfax and hoped that he was suffi-&#xD;
ciently well pleased with their neighborhood to favor it with&#xD;
a long sojourn. Frank assured her that he should never&#xD;
grow weary of the delights of his visit, and should conclude&#xD;
it only when compelled to do so, and then with great regret.&#xD;
The conversation thon became of more general interest. The&#xD;
weather, the condition of the roads, the health of the neigh-&#xD;
borhood, &amp;amp;c., were discussed. And ~then th&amp;amp;- discourse took&#xD;
a higher tone, and the agricultural and political condition&#xD;
and prospects of the whole country, and the great probability&#xD;
of another speedy war with 'Great Britain,. were debated.&#xD;
And Mr. Fairfax. wondered at the extent of information, the&#xD;
strong grasp of mind, and the depth and justness of thought,&#xD;
displayed by this recluse lady upon subjects apparently so&#xD;
foreign to her daily experience.&#xD;
They made quite a long morning visit, and before their&#xD;
departure, Captain Clifton took an opportunity~..-..while Mr.&#xD;
Fairfax was walking around the room and staring at soni~&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
old family pictures, among which hung a portrait by ~-,&#xD;
of Oliver Cromwell, as Lord Protector of F1ngland-to draw&#xD;
his mother aside, and say to her-~-&#xD;
"Madam, I have a proposition to make to you, or a favor&#xD;
to ask-as it may turn out."&#xD;
"What is it, my son V' gravely inquired the lady.&#xD;
"You heard Mr. Fairfax speak of the young mountain-girl&#xD;
whom we met just before the storm, and who kindly con-&#xD;
ducted us to her grandfather's cabin ~"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"It is of her that I would speak, and for her that I would&#xD;
enlist your sympathy and protection-"&#xD;
"Go on, I attend, my son."&#xD;
"You have given me some credit for insight into character.&#xD;
If my judgment is worthy of your consideration, this young&#xD;
girl is deserving of your kindest offices."&#xD;
"Does she deserve them 'P'&#xD;
"Madam, she impressed me as being a child of high moral&#xD;
and mental endowments, and the trying experience of one&#xD;
night pro~ted the truth of that impression."&#xD;
"Does she need my good offices 'P'&#xD;
"Mother! with the finest intellectual capacities, she is&#xD;
nearly destitute of all opportunities of intellectual culture.&#xD;
That is bad-but not so deplorable as. what follows. Kate&#xD;
Kavanagh-that is her name-is far removed from all of her&#xD;
own sex. Her young brother, her only protector, is absent&#xD;
from home from earliest dawn till. late at night. Her only&#xD;
companionn is an old man, an habitual drunkard, subject to&#xD;
frequent and furious fits of mania-a-potU. Her case, upon&#xD;
my slowing, may not be so exigent. But if you had seen&#xD;
her as I did, it would seem so. Her brother being best ac-&#xD;
quainted with the circumstances, is the best judge in the&#xD;
premises, and is very anxious upon his sister's account, and&#xD;
wishes to get her a place at service.~~&#xD;
* "But' if she is a girl of ~o excellent a nature as you have&#xD;
supposed, will she leave her aged relative '~"&#xD;
"Not willingly, certainly-but-I wish the opportunity&#xD;
of improving her condition afforded her, indeed, I promised&#xD;
'her brother Carl that it should be presented."&#xD;

last year. I formed a good opinion oZ him. If his sister is&#xD;
equal to him she must be a meritorious girl."&#xD;
"She is very superior to him, madam."&#xD;
The lady was mistress of great promptitude and decision&#xD;
of action. With her eyes fixed upon the ground she re-&#xD;
flected for a few moments, then lifting them, said-.-&#xD;
"Write to your friend Carl Kavanagh~~.-."'&#xD;
"Not my friend, dear madam, an' it please you!" haughtily&#xD;
interrupted her son.&#xD;
A slight shade of disapproval or of displeasure clouded the&#xD;
lady's brow for a moment, and she said-&#xD;
"Write then to your dependent, Carl Kavanagh, and let&#xD;
him know that I am willing to receive his sister into my own&#xD;
service 'on trial-and that he may bring her hither as soon&#xD;
as is convenient."&#xD;
"Thank you, dearest madam, I will write to-day, and send a&#xD;
messenger with the letter. I am really pleased and grateful&#xD;
for this kindness," said Archer Clifton, pressing his lips to&#xD;
the cheek she offered to his salute.&#xD;
'The young men soon after took leave, being engaged to&#xD;
dine that' day at home at White Cliffs.&#xD;
"Clifton !" said Mr Fairfax, as they rode along, "excuse&#xD;
me for telling you freely how highly I honor your mother.&#xD;
Yes! you may stare! I-the irreverent-the rash said-&#xD;
eccc~tse me for telling you how highly I honor your mother-..&#xD;
for, by my faith, she is a lady whom to praise is presump-&#xD;
tion! But, my d~ar Clifton, how is it that she resembles so&#xD;
closely that .old portrait of Oliver Cromwell, which hangs,&#xD;
besides, between two family portraits. It is not possible you&#xD;
claim descent from him ?"&#xD;
"My mother does, by the female line. I do not think I&#xD;
have much of his nature. In his time I should have been a&#xD;
royalist. My mother venerates his character very highly."&#xD;
"By my soul! she is like him enough in feature."&#xD;
"Yes, and in many points of character,*she is strikingly&#xD;
like him."&#xD;
In conversation such as this the friends reached White&#xD;
Cliffs, and Mr. Fairfax retired to his 'chamber to dress for&#xD;
dinner, and Captain Clifton entered the library for the pure&#xD;
pose of writing a letter to Carl Kavanagh.&#xD;

THE TIDE OF FATE.&#xD;

CAPThV(N Clifton had written to Carl Kavanagh, informing&#xD;
him of the situation he had procured for the sister of the&#xD;
latter, at Hardbargain. And within' this letter he had in-&#xD;
closed a longer one, to Kate, filled with good counsels and'&#xD;
urgent reasons why she should yield to the wishes of her&#xD;
brother, and accept the place offered to her. After hav-&#xD;
ing dispatched these letters by a boy, who left White Cliffs&#xD;
that afternoon, on horseback, he delivered himself up to the&#xD;
delights of Miss Clifton's society, forgetting all about the&#xD;
mountain-girl, until the next day, when, being seated in the&#xD;
library, his messenger returned, entered his presence, and&#xD;
handed him a packet. It was a letter from Carl Ka~ranag1i,&#xD;
inclosing one from Kate. He read Carl's epistle first. It&#xD;
began by expressing much gratitude to his benefactor, for&#xD;
his kindness in having procured a situation for his sister, and&#xD;
went on by expressing much sorrow that he could not prevail&#xD;
upon Kate, either by entreaties or threats, to accept it, and&#xD;
unbounded indignation at what he called the girl's wicked&#xD;
stubbornness. The letter closed by reiterating the thanks&#xD;
of the writer. Captain Olifton held the letter open in his&#xD;
hand, and lifting his head, fell into deep thought. It was&#xD;
strange how much this little matter depressed him. Account&#xD;
for it, any philosopher that can. 'Some proud people have a&#xD;
proclivity to patronage-Captain Clifton was very proud,&#xD;
and perhaps he was piqued at being prevented playing the&#xD;
patron. Perhaps it was really disappointed benevolence.&#xD;
Only it is certain that Archer Clifton did not possess that&#xD;
quality to an imrioderate degree-and having once done his&#xD;
duty of charity, would be likely to content himself wi~th any&#xD;

result. Perchance he felt a deeper interest in the rugged&#xD;
little mountaineer than he would have acknowledged, even&#xD;
to himself. Perhaps it was prescience-the shadow of com~&#xD;
ing events. Be that as it may, Archer Clifton walked up&#xD;
and down the floor in silent thought, occasionally 'broken by a&#xD;
slight sigh. It was wonderful how much the knowledge that&#xD;
he should not have this child at home in his mother's house,&#xD;
vexed his soul.&#xD;
At length he recollected Kate's own letter, yet unopened.&#xD;
But of what avail to read it! It would certainly be the&#xD;
counterpart of Carl's. He opened it. It was not, however.&#xD;
In the first place, 'the paper was perfectly clean; and in the&#xD;
second, the writing, spelling, and style, were rather better.&#xD;
She acknowledged the goodness of Captain Clifton, in taking&#xD;
thought of her humble wants-expressed regret that she&#xD;
could. not 'avail herself of his kindness-could not leave her&#xD;
grandfather, who needed her services, and subscribed her~clf&#xD;
Captain Clifton's obliged and grateful servant. It was very&#xD;
much like Carl's, after all. But here is a postscript. What&#xD;
morp can she have to say, after what she has said, thought&#xD;
Clifton, as he turned to it. It read thus-&#xD;
"P. 5.-I hope Captain Clifton ~will pardon me, if he thinks&#xD;
that I am doing wrong-but it has come into my head, that&#xD;
as Captain Clifton is about to marry, and reside in future at&#xD;
White Chffs.-and as Mrs. Clifton of Hardbargain, will then&#xD;
be quite alone-and as she is not so young, or active, or&#xD;
able to ride about her plantation, overseeing her field hands&#xD;
as formerly-perhaps she will be thinking of getting a farm..&#xD;
manager..-~..if so, will Captain Clifton kindly remember my&#xD;
brother Carl, and speak a favorable word for him to the lady&#xD;
of Hardbargain, who already knows and trusts him ~ If&#xD;
Carl gets a situation as overseer, I can keep house for him,&#xD;
and we can both take care of our grandfather. Indeed I am&#xD;
afraid Captain Clifton will be justly angry with me for this&#xD;
liberty."&#xD;
"What a letter !" exclaimed Archer Clifton, as his face&#xD;
alternately lighted up with satisfaction, or became clouded&#xD;
with thought. "What a letter for a rustic girl of fourteen!&#xD;
Yet characteristic of her and of her situation. Showing the&#xD;
germs of reflection, forethought, courage and promptitude,&#xD;
&#xD;
the gifts of nature, mingled with that frankness bordering&#xD;
upon presumption, which belongs to total ignorance of the&#xD;
world. To dare to speak familiarly of our domestic affairs&#xD;
Rut yet how naively she deprecates my displeasure, at what&#xD;
she feels may be received as presumption."&#xD;
So deeply did Captain Clifton study Kate and her letter;&#xD;
Kate's remarkable countenance, with its breadth of brow and&#xD;
gentleness of eyes, haunted him.&#xD;
He was a man of'prompt decision and action-so, having&#xD;
once admitted the idea that his mother needed an overseer,&#xD;
he exclaimed-&#xD;
"Yes-my mother must be relieved from her arduous oc-&#xD;
cupation~unbefitting a lady of her rank, and especially of&#xD;
her age. Why could I not think of that before ~ Why&#xD;
should I never have seen the necessity, until Catherine held&#xD;
it up before me ~ Yes-my mother must have a manager 6u&#xD;
her farm, and Carl Kavanagh shall be the man. I will pay&#xD;
his salary myself." And he rung the bell, ordered his horse,&#xD;
and in less than fifteen minutes was on his way to Hard..&#xD;
bargain.&#xD;
As he rode up to the house, he met a girl with a pail on~&#xD;
her head, going to the spring, 'and inquired of her where her&#xD;
mistress was to be found. He was told,," down in the wheat&#xD;
field." So, turning his horse's head a little to the left of the&#xD;
house, he rode down the slope of the hill, to a wide harvest&#xD;
field, where he found Mrs. Clifton, seated on her mule, super-&#xD;
intending the operations of some fifteen or twenty laborers,&#xD;
who were employed in stacking wheat. He rode up to his&#xD;
mother's side, alighted, and held out his hand, saying-&#xD;
"How-do-you-do, to-day, madam ~ Busily engaged as&#xD;
ever, I see, mother."&#xD;
"How-do-you-do, Archer $ Yes, very busy."&#xD;
While Captain Clifton was revolving in his mind the best&#xD;
way of introducing the object of his visit, which he had&#xD;
reason to believe would be distasteful to the energetic, inde-&#xD;
pendent lady-she quite unconsciously anticipated his in-&#xD;
tention, and relieved him fi'om his embarrassment, by .say-&#xD;
ing-&#xD;
"The heat is extremely oppressive, and I begin to find&#xD;
this business too much for me, Archer. This continuing out&#xD;
in the fields day after day, and all day long, throughout&#xD;

this burning weather, begins to tell, even upon my constitu&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
Archer Clifton looked at his mother and noticed for the&#xD;
first time a slight but certain change in her countenance,&#xD;
invisible, perhaps, to an indifferent glance, but seeming to&#xD;
the eye of affection., fearfully like the very earliest premoni-&#xD;
tory symptoms of decay. That look pierced him to the&#xD;
heart. The fainter sound of her voice, too, had vaguely&#xD;
suggested failing strength-it fell upon his, ear like a pro~&#xD;
phecy, a warning, a knell. He realized then, for the first&#xD;
time, that his mother was mortal-was growing old-that&#xD;
some day he should lose her. He felt then,, for the first time,&#xD;
how much he-a man-had rested on this good mother-and&#xD;
his heart was troubled within him.. And yet it was all caused&#xD;
only by a transient weariness in the look of her *face, and a&#xD;
faintness in the tone of' her voice. But more than all things&#xD;
else on earth-more deeply-though less ardently-than his&#xD;
own fair expectant bride-.--did Archer Clifton love his mo-&#xD;
ther! It had even been said, some years before, by one who&#xD;
knew him best, that Clifton could never love any woman&#xD;
with the full force of his nature unless in qualities of mind&#xD;
and heart she resembled his mother. But of course, Captain&#xD;
Clifton had disproved that prophecy by adoring his cousin,&#xD;
the haughty and beautiful Miss Clifton. This is a digression&#xD;
-.to return-&#xD;
As the new pang of fear for his mother's health sped&#xD;
through his heart, Archer Clifton took her hand-he had a&#xD;
singularly sweet and persuasive voice and manner, when&#xD;
moved by his affections, and said-&#xD;
"There is no necessity for it, dear mother. Surely, the&#xD;
motive that prompted you when I was a lad, and when this&#xD;
farm was our only prospect, has long ceased to operate."&#xD;
"I know it, Archer. For some years past this personal&#xD;
superintendency of the fields has been mo.re a matter of.&#xD;
habit, than a matter of necessity~ If I could find a good&#xD;
manager I might try one."&#xD;
"What do you think of Carl Kavanagh in that capacity,&#xD;
mother ~"&#xD;
*" Carl! I never thought of him at all. He has never&#xD;
xoanaged a plantation."&#xD;
"But yet he has been a farm laborer many years-has a&#xD;

practical knowledge of agriculture, and is, besides, a man of&#xD;
more intelligence than is usually to be found in his class."&#xD;
"Yes-he is," said the lady, thoughtfully.&#xD;
"He is also ~a man of excellent moral character, and fault-&#xD;
less habits-qualities not too frequently met with among&#xD;
those of his grade."&#xD;
"True-most true-but yet he is young, and has had no&#xD;
experience in overseeing.&#xD;
"And never will have, dear madam, unless some one gives&#xD;
him the opportunity of making the trial. And as for his&#xD;
youth, mother-why his youth is positively an advantage-&#xD;
for with his practical knowledge, intelligence and honesty;&#xD;
he will be free from the conceit and crotchets of an old&#xD;
manager, and will the more readily fall into your system."&#xD;
"There is something in that," said the lady. "And now,&#xD;
Archer, you will remain and dine with me to-day. And re-&#xD;
member, that when this week' is out, the next week belongs&#xD;
to me. You must bring your friend with you when you&#xD;
come. Where did you leave him ?"&#xD;
"Playing battledore with Zuleime. But, dear mother,&#xD;
about this Carl Kavanagh-I hope you will consider the plan&#xD;
favorably, and' try him."&#xD;
"I will think of it, Archer, because you propose it, if for&#xD;
no other reason. And now the horn is blowing for the hands&#xD;
to go to dinner, and my task for the. day is relieved. Let&#xD;
us return to the house."&#xD;
They turned their animals' heads, and rode up the ascent,&#xD;
and entered the shady yard. Then the lady alighted from her&#xD;
mule, gathered up her riding skirt, and leaning on the arm&#xD;
of her son, entered the house. A plain but substantial din-&#xD;
ner was soon served. Archer Clifton enjoyed his mother's&#xD;
plain meals more than the most luxurious dinners-not but&#xD;
that he had a taste for luxury..-what man has not ?-but that&#xD;
there was a home comfort about his mother's table, that gave&#xD;
him appetite and spirit. And then, after dinner, 'he could&#xD;
go and stretch himself upon the best lounge in that large,&#xD;
shady, breezy parlor, ~ith a book, and read or doze until she&#xD;
had attended to the putting away of 'her 'things, and had&#xD;
locked up her pantries. Then she would come and 'sit in the&#xD;
rocking~chair by his side, while he could stretch himself at&#xD;
ease, in any ungainly attitude he pleased, and feel what a&#xD;

TIlE CURSE OF' CLIFTON.           'TI&#xD;
&#xD;
refreshing. thing it ~wa~ to throw off his dignity in the' pre-&#xD;
sence of~ the onjy one with whom he could do so~.-his own&#xD;
familiar mother. Not but that he honored-nay, revered her&#xD;
~~~tbut ~that he enjoyed only in her house, that deep, full&#xD;
sense of' home freedom, which not only 'her son-but to a&#xD;
certain degree all others felt, who possessed the privilege of&#xD;
the lady's: friendship.&#xD;
This afternoon, then, he was lying at his ease on the cool&#xD;
lounge between the two front windows, which were drawing&#xD;
strOng drafts of air, and flapping the festooned curtains lazily.&#xD;
He had thrown himself out at full length upon the lounge,&#xD;
* in the most delightfully degagi~ attitude, albeit it was some-&#xD;
what angular and awkward-.his head being~ throw~i: back&#xD;
over the end of the lounge,, his hands clasped ahoye his fore-&#xD;
head, and his elbows very prominent, one foot, minus a slip-&#xD;
per, hoisted upon the window..sill; and the other slippered&#xD;
foot 'dangling on the carpet. 'But the picturesque beauty of&#xD;
his dark,~ handsome face, atoned for all the rest. His mother&#xD;
sat in an easy-chair near him, with her feet upon a~footstool,&#xD;
and a workstand by h~r side. She was engaged in stitching&#xD;
wristbande-~--for that vigorous woman never required lounge&#xD;
in the day"time..-.but though she 'never took one, yet she&#xD;
never blamed the indulgence of that habit in others for which&#xD;
she herself felt no inclination. She was .the rno~t liberal and&#xD;
benevolent of alihuman beings, in every act of her daily life.&#xD;
She was happy in seeing others comfortable around her. She&#xD;
was ever pleased to see them enjoying those relaxations which&#xD;
her own strong nature did, not need. Indeed, courage with-&#xD;
out asperity, fortitude without indurancy, strength without&#xD;
hardness, self..denial without sternness, power without arro-&#xD;
gaiice, forn~ed: the peculiar excellence of her character. No&#xD;
wonder that her son revered her. No wonder it had been&#xD;
said of 'him% that he never could love a woman with all the&#xD;
power of his nature, 'unless:in mental and moral endowments I&#xD;
she resembled hi~ mother. As they talked together this&#xD;
afternoon, the hours 'slipped away till late in ,the evening,&#xD;
before the image of the, beautiful Carolyn bad power to draw&#xD;
him from the t&amp;amp;te ~ t6le.. During the afternoon lie had pre-&#xD;
vailed with his mother to receive Carl Kavanagh as her over"&#xD;
seer-and to have the comfortable log-cabin which had been&#xD;
&#xD;
occupied by the first proprietor of the soil, prepared for the&#xD;
reception of the family.&#xD;
When Archer Clifton at length arose to' take his leave,&#xD;
he pressed his mother to his heart with so much fondness&#xD;
and pOwer, that the quiet, calm lady laughed, a little, low;&#xD;
jolly laugh, and jested about Carolyn's jealousy-even of his&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
Ca&#xD;
self ptain Clifton returned to White Cliffs, and gave him-&#xD;
up for the rest of the evening, to the charms of Carolyn's&#xD;
conversation.&#xD;
K The next day was one of festivity. Mrs. Cilfton, of Hard-&#xD;
bargain, came over to dine at 'White Cliffs, and to meet a&#xD;
large party of the neighboring gentry. Th~ day after that&#xD;
the whole party dined and spent the evening at Hardbargain&#xD;
-and this was 'the commencement of a series of neighbor-&#xD;
hood entertainments in honor of the approaching marriage,&#xD;
which were kept up for several weeks. The wedding was&#xD;
to come off in the course of a month-the' present delay being&#xD;
owing to this circumstance: old Mr. Clifton had sent' to&#xD;
England,. by the good ship Rockbridge, Captain Cater, an&#xD;
extensive order, including a splendid outfit for the bride;&#xD;
and ~they were now awaiting to hear of the the arrival of' 'the&#xD;
Rockbridge at Norfolk. In all the excitement of 'social&#xD;
enjoyment, Captain Clifton had found time to ride to the&#xD;
mountain hut, and arrange with Carl Kavanag~ to come and&#xD;
take the situation of overseer at Hardbargain.' He agreed&#xD;
to pay the latter a liberal salary, and to provide a comfortable&#xD;
house for his family. One thing surprised and annoyed&#xD;
him. Kate, who. had written so freely, frankly, alinoist pre-&#xD;
sumptuously to him-received him with: the old cold shyness&#xD;
and reserve-not even expressing the least gratitude for the&#xD;
kindiless he had shown in getting the situation for her brother,&#xD;
or the trouble he had condescended to take, in 'coming. per-&#xD;
sonally to inform them ~f it. 'He agreed With Carl, th~t the&#xD;
latter, with his grandfather arid sister, should remove to&#xD;
Hardbargaiu in the course of the week-and on his~ own part&#xD;
he promised to have the log-heuse prepared ' for their re-&#xD;

turned pale and trembled, and when he took her hand he&#xD;
found it cold.&#xD;
"I do not think you are well, my dear girl-your moun-&#xD;
tai~ air does not engender chills, does it ?" he asked, pressing&#xD;
the cold fingers.&#xD;
She raised her eyes one brief instant to his, and dropped&#xD;
them quickly again, while her pale cheek and brow became&#xD;
suffused with crimson, and her hand that he held in his own&#xD;
throbbed like a heart.&#xD;
"When we get you to the plantation you will be better,&#xD;
my dear girl," said Clifton, kindly, shaking her hand and&#xD;
letting it go.&#xD;
Captain Clifton rode away full of thought-speculating&#xD;
more upon Catherine's reserve than became a gentleman of&#xD;
his station and importance. What was it to him that a rustic&#xD;
girl was too shy to express in person, her thanks for a favor&#xD;
received, even though she had "screwed her courage to the&#xD;
sticking place" to write to him and solicit it? Many people,&#xD;
more conversant with the world than Catherine, can write&#xD;
that which they-never can bring their lips to say. Besides&#xD;
it was uo matter-what was that lowly maiden to him, the&#xD;
heir of Clifton, and the prospective husband of the highest&#xD;
and haughtiest lady in the land? Yes-what to him except&#xD;
an object of his high patronage could be that girl of-i--not&#xD;
only "humble parentage," but indubitably low birth? lie&#xD;
rode on dissatisfied, he knew not wherefore, with her and&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
As for Catherine, she stood-lost-where he had left her&#xD;
-lost to the consciousness of her grandfather's and of Carl's&#xD;
presence-with her eyes fixed upon the ground, blaming her-&#xD;
self for her awkwardness and seeming ix~gratitude; wonder-&#xD;
ing if he blamed her too; wondering why it was that when&#xD;
she saw him enter she grew cold and trembled so; and when&#xD;
be spoke to her in' that gentle tone, and looked at her with&#xD;
that gentle gaze-her whole nature shrank away in fear and&#xD;
trepidation-and though she would have given the world foi&#xD;
the ability to express her gratitude and regard, all power of&#xD;
uttering a grateful word or of lifting a grateful glance to his&#xD;
face, deserted, and left her pale and trembling before the&#xD;
man whom she had no cause to fear, and every reason to&#xD;
trust. CatherinQ stood with her mind- deep in this problem,&#xD;
&#xD;
until the harsh voice of Carl ~tartlod her, saying, in rasping&#xD;
tones-&#xD;
"Well! are you going to stand there burrowing your&#xD;
eyes in the ground all day? A pretty way you have behaved!&#xD;
Please goodness, you've got no more manners than a dumb&#xD;
brute! I take my oath I am ashamed of you! Now there&#xD;
was Captain Clifton, a gentleman of so high rank, conde-&#xD;
scending to come here and tell us himself of the 'place he&#xD;
had got for us, even after your unmannerly refusal of that&#xD;
first place-and here were you with not one word of thanks&#xD;
tI give-no! please Heaven', not' so much as one civil look!&#xD;
I wonder what he'll think of you ?"&#xD;
"What, indeed ?" repeated Catherine, very meekly.&#xD;
But Carl scarcely recognized her voice. It was no longer&#xD;
the childish treble-it was the deep, full, melodious voice of&#xD;
rich womanhood.&#xD;
"Why, the kindest thought he can have of you, 'will be to&#xD;
think you are a fool-that is all."&#xD;
"Carl, I was in fear of him."&#xD;
";In fear of him! In fear of Archer Clifton! A man&#xD;
whom all the country knows to be of the highest honor-&#xD;
and one to whom even I, cautious as I am, could trust you&#xD;
with, to go from one end of' the world to the other !"&#xD;
"I know that, Carl-I know he is a gentleman of honor,&#xD;
but-but-I tremble before him, and have not courage to&#xD;
lift my eyes-"'&#xD;
"But that is so confoundedly ridiculous, now! why are&#xD;
you afraid of shim ?"&#xD;
Kate shook her head and waved her hand in that quick,&#xD;
short manner which was peculiar to her, and turned away-&#xD;
repeating in her own heart the question-"Yes, why, why,&#xD;
WHY ?"&#xD;
Whether the maiden found an answer to her question or&#xD;
not, remained a secret to Carl; this was the first and last&#xD;
conversation they ever held on the subject; and whatever&#xD;
phenomena the opening heart of the maiden revealed to her-&#xD;
self, were carefully shrouded away from the eyes of all.&#xD;
How beautiful was Car&amp;amp;lyn Clifton! So fair, so purely,&#xD;
so divinely fair, so radiant, so refined, so stately! How fit&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
There is a divinity that shapes our ends,&#xD;
iLough hew them as we wilI.--SUAKsPEARE.&#xD;
CARL KAVANAGH and his sister were settled in the log.&#xD;
cabin on the farm of Hardbargain. Carl, as an old acquaint.&#xD;
ance of the mistress, and a late laborer on the plantation, fell&#xD;
readily into his new business of overseeing it. Catherine&#xD;
began to busy herself in the management of her new and&#xD;
very comfortable home. Their cabin contained a sitting-&#xD;
room, kitchen, and two chambers. Mrs. Clifton had gratified&#xD;
her own kindly and benevolent disposition by adding several&#xD;
plain articles of furniture to the small stock possessed by the&#xD;
poor family. She had, besides, given Catherine a set of half-&#xD;
worn, white dimity curtains, and a pair of coarse, home-made,&#xD;
white counterpanes. These gave an air of neatness, ap-&#xD;
proaching-I had almost said refinement to. the sitting-room,&#xD;
and two little bed-rooms. Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain,&#xD;
was not addicted to taking sudden likings-indeed, though a&#xD;
lady of perfect frankness, benevolence and liberality of judg-&#xD;
ment, she was cool and prudent-yet, notwithstanding this,&#xD;
her kindest affections were at once attracted towards Kate.&#xD;
It is true she had been prepared to think well of the child&#xD;
from an intimate knowledge of her brother Carl's honesty&#xD;
and intelligence, but at the first sight of Catherine, the noble&#xD;
countenance of the mountain-girl riveted her esteem. There&#xD;
are some faces which we know at a glance cannot belong to&#xD;
other than a fine, high-toned character. And such a coun-&#xD;
tenance was that of Catherine. And it won upon the lady&#xD;
every day, as no merely beautiful face could ever have done.&#xD;
For hers was a brow-&#xD;
"Where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance&#xD;
of-"&#xD;
a peerless woman. Often Mrs. Clifton invited Catherine to&#xD;
bring her work and sit with her through the afternoon, und&#xD;

&#xD;
seldom did she let the girl return without placing in her hand&#xD;
some book just suitable to her very age, and the stage of&#xD;
progress of her mind. And oh! did not the heart of the&#xD;
maiden kindle and glow with love and admiration for the&#xD;
noble lady, who, without one particle of pride, or the least&#xD;
pretension to condescension-condescended so much. And so&#xD;
Catherine grew to understand and appreciate Mrs. Clifton,&#xD;
and to k~ok upon her with a feeling amounting almost to&#xD;
worship. How happy were those afternoons spent with her&#xD;
in the cool and breezy parlor.' How deeply grateful was&#xD;
Rate for all her benefits-how anxious to prove her grati-&#xD;
tude-~.to do something for her benefactress. But Kate was&#xD;
very ~shy, and her love only spoke in the stealthy look of af-&#xD;
fection fixed upon the lady, and withdrawn with a deeply&#xD;
blushing cheek if discovered. But by these tokens sure did&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton know the sweetness' and the tenderness, the&#xD;
modesty and the sincerity of the maiden's hidden heart. And&#xD;
all this time was Catherine wishing for the ability to tell her&#xD;
friend how much she thanked and loved her. One afternoon&#xD;
she mustered up the courage to tell the lady that she should&#xD;
like to read to her any time that it would be agreeable; also,&#xD;
that she had some skill in doing up laces and such things,&#xD;
and that she should be happy if she could assist Mrs. Clif-&#xD;
ton in such matters. Mrs. Clifton' placed her hand atEec~.&#xD;
tionately on Catherine's head, and declined all her offers of&#xD;
service except that which related to the reading-which she&#xD;
accepted-hoping thereby to improve her prot6g6 in many&#xD;
ways--.to direct her choice of books, to correct her elocution,&#xD;
and to awaken her understanding of what she read by quest.&#xD;
tions' and comments. So. they began a course of historical&#xD;
reading with Rollin's Ancient 'History. And that which&#xD;
this excellent lady commenced as a duty of kindness soon&#xD;
became a matter of daily recreation. It was indeed a rare&#xD;
intellectual pleasure to arouse, cultivate and hold communion&#xD;
with a fresh, vigorous, original enthusiastic mind like that&#xD;
of Catherine. And those afternoons were almost as happy&#xD;
for the lady as for her prot~g~-happier for Catherine they&#xD;
could not have been. Once; the shy girl was entirely car-&#xD;
ried out of herself and her reverie by the following circum-&#xD;
~stance: The lady had inadvertently let fall that she was a&#xD;
descendant of Oliver Cromwell, when Kate, hurried beyond&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
her consciousness, clasped her hand and gazed fervently up&#xD;
in her face, exclaiming-.&#xD;
"Descended 'from Oliver Cromwell! Descended from&#xD;
Oliver Cromwell, that friend of man? that friend of freedom?&#xD;
Oh! it is no wonder, lady, that you are so noble! so supe-&#xD;
rior to all the world !"'&#xD;
"My Catherine," said the lady, calmly withdrawing her&#xD;
hand. "You know too little-far too little of the world, to&#xD;
judge how I stand in comparison to others. And what know&#xD;
you of Oliver Cromwell? Our reading has scarcely reached&#xD;
the invasion of Britain by the Romans."&#xD;
"Oh, lady! lady! lady !" said Kate, warmly, being not&#xD;
yet recovered from her trance-" lady-Carl and I had not&#xD;
many books, so we read what we had over and over again!&#xD;
And one of the books we~read the most was the life of Oliver&#xD;
Cromwell !"&#xD;
"You are generally so shy, Catherine, that it is a blind&#xD;
work in me to direct your studies, not knowing what you&#xD;
have read and what you have not."&#xD;
Yes-very delightful to both were these seasons, and very&#xD;
strong was the affection beginning to cement between the&#xD;
lady and the maiden. There was only one tbing that dis-&#xD;
turbed Catherine in the perfect enjoyment of these after-&#xD;
noons. When Archer Clifton would surprise them by&#xD;
suddenly entering the room, and throwing himself into&#xD;
an arm-chair or upon a' sofa, 'her heart would stand still,&#xD;
and her whole frame tremble with an agitation as impossible&#xD;
to comprehend as to conquer. And yet much as his&#xD;
arrival disturbed her, his departure failed to make her&#xD;
happy.' On the contrary, it left a strange sadness and yearn-&#xD;
ing she could not shake off. But then these things were of&#xD;
rare occurrence. Captain Clifton very seldom found time to&#xD;
visit his mother-he was contented to know that she had a&#xD;
companion ;-and as for Kate, he never thought of her at&#xD;
all-she was pro~4ded for and forgotten. Body, soul, and&#xD;
spirit were taken up-absorbed in the contemplation of his&#xD;
promised bride, and in the anticipation of her possession.&#xD;
Catherine knew he was soon to be married, but what of that?&#xD;
She was a child, with no knowledge at her tender. years to&#xD;
understand her own heart, and no skill to define its first de-&#xD;
velopuients.&#xD;

TIlE CTTRSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
At White Cliffs "all went merry as a marriage bell."&#xD;
The "Rockbridge" was at length telegraphed at Norfolk,&#xD;
A letter with an invoice was received by Mr. Clifton, who&#xD;
immediately dispatched a special messenger to receive his&#xD;
valuable portion of the cargo. The wedding-day was fixed&#xD;
for that day week, and great preparations were on foot.&#xD;
The gentry of the neighboring counties were invited. The&#xD;
mansion-house was "swept and garnished" from garret to&#xD;
cellar. Frank and Zuleime were daily rehearsing their parts&#xD;
as bridesmaid and groomsman, which Frank declared to be&#xD;
only an apprenticeship to the business of enacting bride and&#xD;
groom. Some 'city guests from Richmond had arrived by&#xD;
particular invitation, four or five days before the expected&#xD;
wedding. Last of all came the wagon with the boxes from&#xD;
Norfolk. They were opened in the hall-such treasure of&#xD;
splendid attire, and such sets of jewelry! And, above all,&#xD;
such a trousseau for the bride-conspicuous in which was the&#xD;
bridal dress and veil-the bridal dress and train of richest&#xD;
white brocade heavily embroidered with silver, after th~ gor-&#xD;
geous fashion of that time-the bridal veil of finest lace-&#xD;
the orange flower wreath of pearls and emeralds-the pearl&#xD;
embroidered gloves and slippers-the pearl and silver mounted&#xD;
fan, and all complete in correspondence. And richer still&#xD;
was a ball-dress of blue silver-embroidered brocade, with its&#xD;
elegant coiffure of ostrich feathers, the sight of which Zuleime&#xD;
declared was enough to precipitate any girl into matrimony.&#xD;
Every one was too happy, too busy and too self-important&#xD;
to notice the deathly hue of Georgia's cheek, far less to~ de-&#xD;
tect the fitful glare of the well-guarded eye. Every one but&#xD;
her husband, who, leaving his daughters and their maids to&#xD;
unpack the boxes, followed her into her own chamber, saying,&#xD;
as he fondly laid his hand upon her shoulder-&#xD;
"My darling doesn't seem to be merry."&#xD;
She shrank-shuddered from his touch, exclaiming, almost&#xD;
shrilly.-&#xD;
"Leave me&#xD;
"Leave, you, my dear !-~--my child 1-why, leave you?" he&#xD;
asked, passing his hand gently around her shoulders.&#xD;
"Leave me! leaye me !" she cried, sharply, casting off&#xD;
the arm and springing Vack-her cheek blanched, her teeth&#xD;
snapping, her eyes sparkling fire, more like a terrified wolf&#xD;

than a woman, "have I not told you never, never to come&#xD;
n~r me in my dark hour ?"&#xD;
"But why should my cherished pet have dark hours ?" he&#xD;
persisted, approaching her.&#xD;
"Keep off! keep off! old man, you know not what you&#xD;
do!"&#xD;
"Yes, I'm old-I know I'm old-I wish I wasn't, for I&#xD;
love you, my darling. Yes, I love you more tenderly and&#xD;
less selfishly than if I was younger. I love you entirely-&#xD;
altogether- your little dark face-your little fiery ways-..&#xD;
your little outbursts of temper that no one sees but me, who&#xD;
look upon it with indulgent eyes. Would a young man love&#xD;
you so tenderly, Georgia ?"&#xD;
"IDriveller! you make me loathe you! 'My little fiery&#xD;
ways.' 'My little outbursts of temper,' forsooth! How&#xD;
little do you understand me! You sting my soul to frenzy&#xD;
with your dotage, and then twaddle about liking my 'little&#xD;
outbursts of temper,' forsooth."&#xD;
"Dotage! Yes! I really do suppose you consider it&#xD;
dotage!"&#xD;
"Yes! drivelling! idiotic! imbecile dotage 1"&#xD;
"Yes! I do suppose you think it is! I am too old for you,&#xD;
Georgia-I know it, alas! too well, now that it is too late-&#xD;
and yet you did not raise the least objection to becoming my&#xD;
wife, Georgia."&#xD;
"Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! Objection! Iwas1but&#xD;
fifteen years of age when you bribed me to your arms with a&#xD;
set of jewels, and a gold mounted work-box! I was a child,&#xD;
delighted with glittering toys! and fond, yes very fond of&#xD;
the grandfatherly old man that poured them into my lap!&#xD;
Did that child-fondness deceive you ?"&#xD;
"It did, it did! You were very fond of me when you&#xD;
were a child! Would to God I could have spell-bound you&#xD;
to that age, so you never could have grown older! Oh! I&#xD;
could find it in heart to shame my manhood, to shame my&#xD;
gray hairs and weep! I should not have married you, Geor-&#xD;
gia, child! I should not have sacrificed you to my selfish&#xD;
bye-yet, no! It was not selfish love! I wished your&#xD;
greatest good. I wished to surround you for life with all the&#xD;
means and appliances of -happiness. I wished to lavish&#xD;
wealth upon you-ay, wealth of gold, and wealth of affec-&#xD;

do you know what Women value more than gold and jewels,&#xD;
and dress, and carriages, and horses, and servants ?-I'll tell&#xD;
you-the ungalled, unfettered heart's freedom !"&#xD;
"I know it! Oh! I know it! My love has destroyed&#xD;

bird, and long to have it for your own, only to caress and&#xD;
pamper and pet it! Oh, Georgia! my child, my pet, my&#xD;

"~1h4! And did you never see such a bird~as you spoke&#xD;

wished only to make you happy-I have failed! I have&#xD;
made you miserable !"&#xD;
"'.Miserab!e,' ruined! despairing! desperate!" she cried,&#xD;
wildly wringing her hands.&#xD;
"Nay, not despairing, Georgia! I am an old man, as you&#xD;
justly said-quite an old man. I have not very long to live,&#xD;
and when I die, Georgia, you will still be a very young wo-&#xD;
man. Rethink you, you are scarce seventeen-in ten years&#xD;
more you will be but twenty-seven, and is it even likely that I&#xD;
shall lWe so long as that! No! And after my heart is&#xD;
cold, and my head is laid low, Georgia trill be a beautiful&#xD;
young widow-ay, and with a rich jointure, too! I shall&#xD;
take care of that !"&#xD;
"Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! pathetic! I tell you, that if you&#xD;
were to die to-morrow, my life is not the less ruined-~de-&#xD;
spairing !" bitterly exclaimed the young woman.&#xD;
"Nay, but that cannot be, Georgia. Ruined!. Despair-&#xD;
ing! What! at seventeen years of age! Nonsense, my&#xD;
love! .A'othing but crime can make the yo~ithful despair!&#xD;
Nonsense, my child! You are hysterical !" he said, moving&#xD;
towards her with outstretched arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Dotard! driveller !" she cried, turning fiercely upon&#xD;
him, with eyes blazing with scorn and malignity. "Imbecik!&#xD;
Will you leave me to myself !"&#xD;
The old gentleman turned away, walked several times.&#xD;
slowly up and down the floor, and finally saying-&#xD;
"Yes, I know I am a dotard! I know it, and I grow&#xD;
ashamed of dotage-" clapped his hat upon his head and&#xD;
walked out.&#xD;
Bitterly did the old man rue his folly, yet, alas! he knew&#xD;
but half the cause of that ingrate and wretched woman's&#xD;
fierce outbreaks of temper.&#xD;
She followed his retreating form, with a glaring of mingled&#xD;
rage and fear, gnawing her whit~ lips, while she muttered, in&#xD;
a low, fierce tone-&#xD;
"I could tear my heart out! I could bite my tongue off,&#xD;
for thus betraying me! Shall I ever have power to chain&#xD;
and guide the tiger in me! But he with his doting, and they&#xD;
with their dalliance, goad me to extremity? But," she ex-&#xD;
claimed, clenching her fist, setting her teeth, and glaring,&#xD;
while all her countenance darkened with rage and anguish-&#xD;
"But, before they shall MARRY under my very eyes, and live&#xD;
here, maddening my soul and senses, day and night, by the&#xD;
view of their love and joy, I will pull down ruin on the heads&#xD;
of all! Yes, although myself should be the first to fall !"&#xD;
She paused in silent thought some time, then rising, said,&#xD;
"Down, tiger heart! Dourn! crouch! Be smooth, brow!&#xD;
Be smiling, lip! Be 1~ender, eyes! Be soft, voice! And&#xD;
now to go and pacify the old inan,%efore his vexation betrays&#xD;
me to the others. Ah! it is well they have never witnessed&#xD;
my excitement! Come! in time I shall, learn to curb wild&#xD;
impulses, and only spring upon my prey when time and place&#xD;
is fit!"&#xD;
Soft, smooth, fascinating, seductive, she glided from her&#xD;
chamber out into the upper piazza, where the old man's slow&#xD;
and heavy footfall was heard-she glided after him, an&amp;amp;with&#xD;
an air of sweet, familiar, childish freedom, she raised his arm,&#xD;
and putting . her beautiful head under it, drew his hand&#xD;
around her neck and over her bosom, and looking up plead-'&#xD;
ingly, simply, into his benevolent face, muEmured, merely-&#xD;
"I am so sorry, Mr. Clifton !"&#xD;

"Oh, but II am! so sorry !"&#xD;
"Yow, child! Do you think I mind your little petu-&#xD;

"Oh! you are good, you are good. Indeed, I'm quite&#xD;

against his bosom, and clinging close.&#xD;
"You, darling !" cried the old man, stroking her curls in&#xD;
delight.&#xD;
"I am such an irritable, petulant child! I am sure no one&#xD;
would have patience with me but you-that is the reason J&#xD;

worse than ever&#xD;
"My sweet! you can't be spoiled! you are so ingenuous!&#xD;
But now tell me, what vexed my little girl this evening?&#xD;
Come, let me hear?" asked the old man, caressing the&#xD;
syren.&#xD;
"Well! now it was this! I thought you loved Carolyn&#xD;

gazing half-repro~chfnlly, half-pleadingly ~up into hi~ smiling&#xD;

Georgia servedd her loathing heart to give the demanded&#xD;

beautiful, smooth,~ seductive, dangerous as ever; while the&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
THE RUPTURED TIE.&#xD;
Alas! they had been friends in youth,&#xD;
But whispering tongues can poison truth;&#xD;
And constancy lives in realms above,&#xD;
And life is thorny, and youth is vain,&#xD;
And to be wroth with one we love&#xD;
Doth work like madness on the brain.&#xD;
WHAT ruin a single spark of fire may ~pread, if carelessly&#xD;
or designedly dropped amid combustible or inflammable&#xD;
material.&#xD;
What desolation a single word may cause, if thoughtlessly&#xD;
or intentionally- let fall into a passionate, impetuous heart.&#xD;
The three scenes I am about to describe, took place very&#xD;
nearly as they are related.&#xD;
But first a few words of explanation.&#xD;
I feel- that I have~scarcely done justice to the character&#xD;
of Carolyn Clifton, in presenting her only by that cold and&#xD;
frosty crust of pride, which was but the superficial covering&#xD;
of a high-spirited, honorable nature. Her manners were cold&#xD;
and haughty-almost scornful and arrogant-it is but too&#xD;
true. And most people, her family included, supposed her&#xD;
to be destitute of sensibility. Perhaps she was lacking in&#xD;
warmth of affection for her immediate domestic circle. Jier&#xD;
whole heart, with all its deep, profound, untold, unguessed&#xD;
devotion~ was given to Archer Clifton. And while secretly&#xD;
bestowing upon him her entire, un~ivided love-she openly&#xD;
exacted a full, unshared return-al exclusive worship.&#xD;
In truth, in her proud, secret heart, she was a little jealous&#xD;
of Clifton's affection for his mother! She did not love her&#xD;
father so devotedly! -why should Clifton -worship his mo-&#xD;
~5her so'? To1 this jealousy she had never given breath, of&#xD;
course-indeed, to her own passionate love, she had never&#xD;
yet given word-preferring, in her high toned, maiden pride,&#xD;
&#xD;
84&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.             85&#xD;
to leave it to 1~e inferred. She had never even looked her&#xD;
jealousy, yet Mrs. Clifton, with the fine instinct of a woman&#xD;
and a mother, guessed it, and in her presence, skillfully&#xD;
eluded all demonstrations of affection from her son. And so&#xD;
well was the proud, exacting spirit of Miss Clifton known in&#xD;
her own family, that even the sprightly and mischievous out-&#xD;
law, Zuleime, dared take no childish liberty with her sister's&#xD;
betrothed. Thus it happened that Frank Fairfax's unlucky&#xD;
jest had deeply offended the arrogant lady~ the more espe-&#xD;
ciall as in that day, and in that neighborhood, the term&#xD;
"mountain-girl," was too often the mildest name for an evil&#xD;
woman.-ThiS fact, of course, Frank was not acquainted&#xD;
with. And, therefore it was, that he could not understand&#xD;
Carl Kavanagh's excessive anxiety to send his young sister&#xD;
off the mountain ; and could not in the least comprehend the&#xD;
intense indignation of Miss Clifton, and the difficulty Archer&#xD;
Clifton had in restoring her good humor. Even now, Caro-&#xD;
lyn Clifton had not forgotten the circumstance. And truth&#xD;
to tell, she was not well pleased at the continued interest&#xD;
displayed by Captain Clifton for his prot~g~, in bringing her&#xD;
and her family upon his mother's plantation. But she was&#xD;
too proud again to allude to the subject. Carolyn Clifton&#xD;
had never known a care or a contradiction in her life. Her&#xD;
heart was a sound, strong, high, proud thing, and therefore,&#xD;
very like to break itself without fear, full tilt against the first&#xD;
impedimitnt that opposed it. She was, besides, like all women&#xD;
of her fair complexion and fine tempered nerves-" a dis-&#xD;
cerner of spirits." And this quick, delicate, and sure per-&#xD;
ception never failed her, except when she was agitated and&#xD;
blinded by inward passion. Thus, perhaps, quite uncon-&#xD;
sciously, she read the heart of h~ betrothed-and knew it&#xD;
better than he did himself-aLnd thus, perhaps, involuntarily,&#xD;
she afterwards acted on that knowledge.&#xD;
At all events, there was quite enough combustible material&#xD;
on hand for a single spark to ignite it and spread a confla-&#xD;
gration.&#xD;
And the spark-and many sparks were not wanting. A&#xD;
thoughtless jest of Frank's-a slight word dropped by&#xD;
G-eorgia at exactly the right, or rather the wrong time and&#xD;
place-and the whole neighborhood of R-~ County&#xD;
were agog with gossip. And Captain Clifton and his pro-&#xD;

to educate. and marry, and that his repuidican mother was&#xD;
highly in favor of the plan. Others told how tastefully the&#xD;
overseer's house had been furnished and adorned, and-.&#xD;
without the slightest foundation in truth-how many hours a&#xD;
day Captain Clifton now spent with his interesting pupil.&#xD;
The suspicious and malignant circulated a still darker talc,&#xD;
and wondered how long it would last, and how it would all&#xD;
end. And then they denounced Captain Clifton, blamed his&#xD;
mother, and pitied Mis~ Clifton! And all this time, while&#xD;
the whole county was ringing with various and contradictory&#xD;
reports, the persons most concerned ki~w nothing about it.&#xD;
Until the day before the wedding, it was suddenly&#xD;
brought to the knowledge of' both partied, in the following&#xD;
manner&#xD;
The company assembled at Clifton, consisting of old Mr.&#xD;
Clifton's brother-in-law and sister, Judge and Mrs. Cabell,&#xD;
of Richmond, with their three daughters and son, Frank&#xD;
Fairfax, Zuleime, and Captain Clifton, had gone over to dine&#xD;
by previous engagement with Mrs. Clifton,'of Hardbargain.&#xD;
Carolyn Clifton. had been compelled, by a slight headache,&#xD;
to remain at home. And Georgia had chosen to stay to keep&#xD;
her company. The two ladies sat in the dressing-room of&#xD;
Miss Clifton. Carolyn was silent. and abstracted, yet her&#xD;
countenance betrayed more of inward joy than she suspected.&#xD;
A great contrast was her fair, placid face, to that of Georgia,&#xD;
dark, and traversed by spasms of pain-like clouds hurling&#xD;
past a, stormy sky. But if Carolyn lifted her fair lashes a&#xD;
moment, instantly that dark face cleared, crc its expression&#xD;
could be detected. At length she ventured, in a sweet tone,&#xD;
tosay- /&#xD;
Carolyn, my. dear, to morrow is yourwedding day. And&#xD;
-but-there is something which you ought to know before-&#xD;
hand, and which for weeks past I have been trying to gain&#xD;
courage to tell you."&#xD;
"Well, madam ~" asked Miss Clifton, slowly lifting .her&#xD;
snowy lids.&#xD;
"I should-that is, I might expose myself to the resent-&#xD;
ment of all your family by telling you."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then you had best not tell .me, madam."&#xD;
"And yet you ought to be informed, and must. I&#xD;
should never forgive a friend for keeping such a secret from&#xD;
me."&#xD;
A vague fear and tremor seized upon Carolyn Clifton, and&#xD;
kept her silent. The dark lady went on-.&#xD;
"I think the honor, the happiness, even the tranquillity&#xD;
of your married life, depends upon your previous knowledge&#xD;
of this circumstance."&#xD;
"Madam-the honor, happiness, and tranquillity of my&#xD;
married life pass into the keeping of my husband, Captain&#xD;
Clifton, and in him I have the utmost confidence," remarked&#xD;
Carolyn, coldly and proudly, though, alas !-not truly.&#xD;
"Heaven forbid that I should unnecessarily mar that con-&#xD;
fidence! But, my love, you will be sure to hear it, when&#xD;
too late, and from less friendly lips than mine!"&#xD;
"Will it please you, then, madam, to speak out frankly&#xD;
and honestly, and let us know what it is," said Carolyn,&#xD;
scornfully, at the same time that her heart was rising with&#xD;
emotion.&#xD;
"Is it possible you do not guess V'&#xD;
"I do not take the trouble to do so, Mrs. Clifton."&#xD;
"Au! you have always treated me with scorn and hauteur,&#xD;
Miss Clifton. Yet that,. alas! does not relieve me of the&#xD;
painful duty. of putting you on your guard. In a word, then,&#xD;
do you understand the nature of the relations subsisting&#xD;
between Captain Clifton and the sister of his mother's over-&#xD;
seer~"&#xD;
The brow of Carolyn Clifton flushed crimson-but she&#xD;
answered, coldly-&#xD;
"Madam, I believe ti~at young person has been the object&#xD;
of Captain Clifton's benevolence."&#xD;
"Ah! I believe so too! His benevolence is certainly in-&#xD;
disputable, and his honor should be above suspicion !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Georgia, fervently.&#xD;
"Madam-it is !" coldly replied Miss Clifton.&#xD;
"Yes-and yet, Carolyn, my love, a poor and beautiful&#xD;
young maiden cannot continue to be the recipient of a hand-&#xD;
some young ofiiG~er's beneficence with credit to herself, honor&#xD;
to him, or peace or safety to his wife !"&#xD;

&#xD;
~(Jg she so very beautiful ?" was the question surprised&#xD;
from the haughty girl.&#xD;
"Passing beautiful, I think, Carolyn, and this it is that&#xD;
makes the country gentlemen jest so about the matter. They&#xD;
give a far different motive than benevolence ~to the kindness&#xD;
of Captain Clifton to his lovely charge. I know that they&#xD;
do him gross injustice! But this thing should not go on. It&#xD;
is a dangerous relation-dangerous to Archer's own fidelity,&#xD;
dangerous to your peace, and most dangerous of all, to the&#xD;
poor girl's reputation. I advise you to speak to Archer. I&#xD;
would do so myself, but it is too delicate a matter for me to&#xD;
speak to a young gentleman ab~ut. Now in these palmy&#xD;
days of courtship, he may listen to you as he never would~&#xD;
perhaps, afterwards, and you will be able to prevail with him&#xD;
to send this dangerous young beauty, his prot6gii, away.&#xD;
Yes! and you may tell Archer that I advise this; for the&#xD;
good of all parties. Tell him that the whole neighborhood&#xD;
is ringing with gossip that may become slander. Tell him&#xD;
that I say the parties most concerned in this rumor, or in&#xD;
any rumor, will be ever the last to hear it. Tell him that I&#xD;
his friend, Georgia, venture to do him this service, informing&#xD;
him through you. tet there be no concealments. Let all&#xD;
be open candor. I did feel afraid, when I began to tell you&#xD;
this-but now it is out, I feel relieved-I~ have more&#xD;
courage."&#xD;
"Madam !" said Carolyn, more haughtily than before-...&#xD;
"Captain Clifton is quite capable of directing his own con-.&#xD;
duct! And if he were not, I should never rem~ign to him the&#xD;
future control of mine! And, furthermore, madam !" she&#xD;
added, sarcastically, "I too highly honor the man about to&#xD;
become my husband-I have too much self-respect and deli-&#xD;
cacy, to inquire into the nature of Captain Clifton's indi-~&#xD;
vidual and private amusements, whether they relate to&#xD;
hounds, horses, or beggar girls! I leave such investigations&#xD;
to the daughter of the sign-painter!" and with an air&#xD;
of the greatest possible scorn and arrogance she arose, and&#xD;
left the room. Yet under that proud, disdainful bearing, a&#xD;
thousand scorpions, of doubt and jealousy, maddened hit&#xD;
soul. She went at once into her own room, and having&#xD;
locked the door, that no rash intruder should look upon her&#xD;
weakness, gave herself up to. the anguish of her emotions--.&#xD;
&#xD;
now pacing up and down the floor, wringing her hands in&#xD;
distraction-noW throwing herself, face downward, upon the&#xD;
bed, in despair. And yet she had no confidence in Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton's honesty of purpose either&#xD;
En the -meantime, the party assembled~ at Hardbargain&#xD;
were enjoying themselves and the hospitalities of their hostess,&#xD;
to the fullest extent.&#xD;
The late dinner was over; the ladies were lounging about&#xD;
in arm-chairs, or on sofas, in the breezy parlor-dozing,&#xD;
reading, or chatting in low tones, all serenely enjoying that&#xD;
pleasant feeling of home fr~medom and repose, into which Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton ever charmed her guest.&#xD;
The gentlemen had left their wine, and in parties of two&#xD;
and three were strolling about the shady yard, or out&#xD;
through the fields and orchards, to cool their heads, previous&#xD;
to joining the ladies at the tea-table.&#xD;
Archer Clifton, with his cousin, Major Charles Cabell, and&#xD;
Frank Fairfax, took the wooded path leading down the South&#xD;
side of the ridge to a fine spring in the hollow. They came&#xD;
to a log cabin, half hidden by surrounding and overhanging&#xD;
elms-and literally covered with climbing and creeping vines.&#xD;
Before the door sat a girl, spinning on a little wheel, who, at&#xD;
the first glimpse of strangers, instantly arose, and tak~ug up&#xD;
her wheel, retired into the house. - Captain Clifton left his&#xD;
conipanions, and going up to the door, called, saying-&#xD;
"Catherine, my good girl, briug me a gourd here."&#xD;
Kate Kavanagh came, and with her eyes fixed upon the,&#xD;
ground, and her face suffused with a deep blush, handed the&#xD;
required article, and instantly disappeared within.&#xD;
"By all the angels, what* a fine face !" exclaimed Major&#xD;
Cabell, gazing after her.&#xD;
Archer Clifton shot a quick, piercing glance at the speaker,&#xD;
who, meeting it full as he turned, laughed, exclaiming,-as if&#xD;
a new discovery had been made-&#xD;
"Oh! Ay! Soh! you are there, are you? So then,&#xD;
this is the mountain-beauty, the hidden treasure of Archer&#xD;
Clifton, that has set all the country ladies agog with scandal,&#xD;
and all the country gentlemen mad witih envy ?"&#xD;
The hot blood rushed to Clifton's brow.&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
:1&#xD;
If&#xD;
I&#xD;
~ (&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7853-00000041"/>&#xD;
"Oh! now, don't be jealous! Don't be alarmed! Your&#xD;
treasure is safe from me-though, by all the queens of chi~&#xD;
vairy, hers is a noble face-a face to bleed and die for!&#xD;
None of your pretty lily and rose baby beauties that may be&#xD;
seen by hundreds anywhere-but a noble girls fit for a tuon-&#xD;
arch's love and counsellor!"&#xD;
In an instant Archer Clifton strode up and stood with&#xD;
bended brow and folded arms before him; and said, in a low,&#xD;
deep, stern tone of concentrated passion-&#xD;
"You are my relative, friend, ~guest! Your three-fold&#xD;
claim upon my forbearance should protect you from any re-&#xD;
sentment for words spoken against~my honor. But, I charge&#xD;
you, retract your words! And if you harbor one single sus-&#xD;
picion against that young girl, you are a villain! S'deatb,&#xD;
sir! Has the world come to such a pass, and is the honor&#xD;
of Archer Clifton of so little worth, that he cannot protect a&#xD;
poor young maiden without injury to her? By Heaven! be&#xD;
warned! For if you do but breathe one breath to dim the&#xD;
lustre of that girl's goad name-by the good Lord that made&#xD;
us good, and the demon that turned us to evil! relative,&#xD;
friend and guest as you are, I will slay and drag you to her&#xD;
feet to die !"&#xD;
So sudden, so mighty-so appalling was this burst of pas-&#xD;
sion, that for a moment after it was over, Cabell and Fairfax&#xD;
stood as if transfixed with astonishment. Then Cabell, in&#xD;
the frankest way in the world, held out his hand, exclaim-&#xD;
ing-&#xD;
"I like that! D-d if I don't! Come, Clifton-I was&#xD;
wrong, forgive me! give me your hand! By my soul, I like&#xD;
a man that will stand up for-there! by all that's fatal, I&#xD;
had liked to have tripped again !"&#xD;
"Understandume, sir," said Archer Clifton, sternly. "You&#xD;
know me to be on the eve of marriage with our cousin. She&#xD;
is my liege lady, and never for one instant in thought, word,&#xD;
or deed, has my allegiance swerved from her service. And&#xD;
more, gentlemen, both! A single word touchiiig the fair&#xD;
fame of her-of Catherine, I mean-touches me home."&#xD;
They were here overtaken by two or three other gentle-&#xD;
men,. and the conversation took another and less perilous&#xD;
turn, as they wandered down towards the mineral spring.&#xD;
After slaking their thirst, the party divided. Major Cabell&#xD;
&#xD;
joined the three latest corners, and Clifton and Fairfax turned&#xD;
towards the farm-house.&#xD;
'~You seem to be moody this evening, Archer," said&#xD;
Frank, after they had pursued their way for some time in&#xD;
silence.&#xD;
"Yes~that foolish jest of Cabell's has annoyed me. It&#xD;
is villainous! It is diabolical! Such light words, in which&#xD;
a young girl's fair fame is laughed and jested away, may be&#xD;
thoughtless, but they should be punished with death !"&#xD;
"That's a harsh sentence !"&#xD;
"A just one&#xD;
"You feel this bitterly !"&#xD;
"I DO. For her name has been used! Frank! you be-&#xD;
lieve that if a word of disrespect were to be breathed by any&#xD;
inaii against my mother, I would lay that man dead at my&#xD;
feet without an instant's grace ?"&#xD;
"Yes! I thoroughly believe that you would send such an&#xD;
one to his last account in a great hurry."&#xD;
"And if any one were but to look an insult to Catherine,&#xD;
it wOuld rouse all the ferocity of the demon in me to over-&#xD;
throw and trample him to death !"&#xD;
"'All this I steadfastly believe,' as the catechism says&#xD;
about total depravity !"&#xD;
"And, Frank! you, yourself have sometimes spoken flip-&#xD;
pantly of my regard for that girl-never so insultingly as&#xD;
Cabell did just now, else you would not now possess my&#xD;
esteem and friendship-but you have tr~flecl with the subject.&#xD;
Now understand, Frank, that I shall consider it a deep per-&#xD;
sonal affront in future if you repeat it !"&#xD;
"You haven't heard me joke to you about Kate for a long&#xD;
"No-I certainly hayc not."&#xD;
"No-for be hanged if the matter is not getting far too&#xD;
serious for jesting !"&#xD;
"What do you mean&#xD;
"Archer! Have you never heard ~t said that those whom&#xD;
it concerns first to be made acquainted with an injurious re-&#xD;
portare usually the last to hear it, and when they are inno-&#xD;
cent, they are the more exposed for being innocent, because&#xD;
they never suspect the slander, and never guord against it'?"&#xD;
"In Heaven's name, what do you mean'?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"This. Cabell's jest was but the echo of the whole county&#xD;
talk. I have been asked, I suppose, twenty times, by twenty&#xD;
different young men, to tell them all about our adventure&#xD;
upon the mountain."&#xD;
"That was because you first of all represented it as an&#xD;
adventure."&#xD;
"I confess it! In shame and confusion I confess it-but&#xD;
then many times I a~n also asked what is the precise nature&#xD;
of the relations subsisting between yourself and this girl 'f"&#xD;
"NoNd!"&#xD;
"Yes, I tell you !"&#xD;
"No! no one dares to question that !"&#xD;
"But they do, I tell you! Ay, and answer their own&#xD;
questions in a manner that reflects very little honor upon the&#xD;
parties !"&#xD;
"Would God I had never seen the ,girl! Would God I&#xD;
had never brought-her here! I would give my right hand&#xD;
rather than evil should befall her! But wuo is it that dares&#xD;
slander her ~ Tell rhe! Give me some name! Let me&#xD;
have SOME one to make an example of!"&#xD;
"Nay, Clifton! you can't make an example of women and&#xD;
children !" said Frank, evasively.&#xD;
"By Heaven, sir, they have husbands and fathers, who&#xD;
shall be held accountable for the license of tongue they allow&#xD;
their wives and daughters !"&#xD;
"Nay, now, Archer! This is a mere matter of gossip,&#xD;
that will die out, if you are discreet !"&#xD;
"To dare to talk of her! They never looked upon' her&#xD;
face! Else they never could associate the thought of evil&#xD;
with that noble brow, those thoughtful eyes, and serious lips!&#xD;
To slander her!"&#xD;
"Nay, nay-it is not slander; only what I am afraid&#xD;
should become such. It is only fun-joke-"&#xD;
"To dare to joke of her I"&#xD;
"'Her!' Verily, Clifton, any one to hear you breathe&#xD;
'her!' with your full soul's volume poured into the little&#xD;
word, would think there was but one 'her' in the world!&#xD;
Archy, you take a very strange interest in that girl. Are&#xD;
you sure that you are not in love with her ~"&#xD;
"In love with her! Nonsense-she is a child !"&#xD;

"Well then, are you sure you should not be in love with&#xD;
herif she were a woman ~"&#xD;
"iRjdiculous! She is a low-born girl !"&#xD;
"Oh! I forgot! I beg pardon! You demonstrated that&#xD;
to me before."&#xD;
"And, besides, sir; please to remember that all my love&#xD;
and faith are due to my cousin, Miss Clifton; and that she&#xD;
has my whole heart! I love, admire, honor, my beautiful&#xD;
betrothed bride-nor for her proud sake will I brook tl~at&#xD;
any one should think it possible that I could even ~n thought&#xD;
fail in full loyalty to my liege lady! But, Frank! my soul's&#xD;
dear brother! as I tell you everything, I will tell you this!&#xD;
that I feel the very deepest interest in Catherine's welfare!&#xD;
If you ask me why-I tell you I do not know! It surprises&#xD;
and confounds myself! But from the first moment I looked&#xD;
upon her noble face, I felt that interest stir within my deep-&#xD;
est soul. And it has never since ceased !"&#xD;
"I swear you are enamored of her !"&#xD;
"Preposterous, Frank! you make me angry! It is a&#xD;
very different thing from being enamored of her, let me tell&#xD;
you! There is my beautiful, but cold and scornful bride, up&#xD;
at Clifton! Well, I am the most patient of all adoring&#xD;
slaves! I wait upon her* sovereign eyes all day. long! I&#xD;
am 'proud to submit to her ~hims-.to do' her lightest bid-&#xD;
ding, and pick up her lap-dog-or to obey her severest&#xD;
command, and exile myself from her gracious presence all&#xD;
day long But now observe the difference! I feel a deep,&#xD;
strong, strange interest in Kate. I cannot account for It.&#xD;
I feel a sort of unratified -right of property in her. I wish&#xD;
to do her good. But I wish that all the good she may ever~&#xD;
possess in the world, may come from only me! and that for all&#xD;
good things with which I cannot supply her, she may suffer&#xD;
the want rather than owe their possession to another! Very&#xD;
like love, is it not ~ But I wish to control her destiny! I&#xD;
wish to have her in my power !-in all honor, however! It&#xD;
galls me to think that I have no right of authority or guar-&#xD;
dianship over her! I ardently desire such a right! I long&#xD;
to have the disposal of her person and fate! I crave with a&#xD;
frantic cra~ing, to have inore than a father's-more than a&#xD;
husband's-more than a ii~aster's right over her! I would to&#xD;
God she were born mine-my own-body, soul and spirit!&#xD;

&#xD;
My own to use or~ abuse-to crown or kill, as I listed !"&#xD;
exclaimed Clifton, passionately, while his cheeks and very lips&#xD;
were white and dry, and his eyes burned with a fierce, con-&#xD;
suming, inward fire. And forgetting all things real, he felt&#xD;
as in a vision, a girl's spirit swoop down upon his bosom, and&#xD;
a dream voice murmur in his ear-" Oh! if it will give you&#xD;
one instant's joy to press me strongly to your heart-ctush me&#xD;
to death in the fold, and my soul will exhale in rapture to&#xD;
Heaven." The fervid vision came and passed like lightning,&#xD;
and Clifton roused himself from reverie, with a smile and a&#xD;
sneer, saying-" Very like love, all that! is it not ~"&#xD;
But as Frank did not reply, and as they had now arrived&#xD;
*            at the gate leading into the yard, the conversation ceased.&#xD;
The early tea-table was set out' under the shade of the&#xD;
great oaks, and the ladies were walking about, taking the&#xD;
opening air in the yard. As supper was only waiting the&#xD;
arrival of Captain Clifton and Mr. Fairfax, it was i~ow speedily&#xD;
served.&#xD;
After tea was over, the carriages were all brought round,&#xD;
and the company took leave of Mrs. Clifton, and departed.&#xD;
Captain Clifton and Mr. Fairfax were the last to leave..&#xD;
They mounted their horses and took the bridle-path down&#xD;
the mountain-side. This separated them from the rest of&#xD;
their party, who went by the road.' They did not, however,&#xD;
converse. Frank was thoughtful; and Clifton himself buried&#xD;
in a deep reverie.&#xD;
It was quite early when they arrived at White Cliffs; and&#xD;
the remainder of the party had not yet arrived. Mr. Fairfax&#xD;
joined Mrs. Clifton in the garden, and Archer Clifton sought&#xD;
his lady-love, where he was informed he would find her,&#xD;
namely, in the Summer saloon, He threw down his hat and&#xD;
entered hurriedly, intendix~g to surprise from her a hasty kiss.&#xD;
Carolyn was standing looking out of the window upon the&#xD;
rich sunset scen&amp;amp;~-the last sun that would set upon her&#xD;
~.naiden life, perhaps, she thought. On seeing Clifton sh~&#xD;
moved away, and' retreated to' the work-table at which she&#xD;
seated herself. Clifton approached, and with an air of gal-&#xD;
lantry, half serious, half playful, kneeled upon one knee&#xD;
and kissed her hand. She drew it coldly away-but that&#xD;
was the custom of the "proud ladie," and did not surprise&#xD;
her lover. He arose and drew a chair to her side and seated&#xD;
&#xD;
himself, and began to affect an interest in her little lady-like&#xD;
occupations. Her right hand rested upon a pile of beautifully&#xD;
fine linen cambric handkerchiefs-an item in the imported&#xD;
trousseau. He laid his hand upon hers, and asked her some&#xD;
trivial question about them.&#xD;
Now, Carolyn, after a day's extreme suffering, had almost&#xD;
gained a victory t~ver her passion. Her haughtiness had almost&#xD;
saved her. Not to one soul in that house-not to Georgia,&#xD;
had she betrayed the least sign of the cruel suspicion 'that&#xD;
had nearly maddened her brain. Not for all Clifton-not&#xD;
for all the world would she have betrayed her passion to her&#xD;
lover-or condescended to admit that she Iould be jealous&#xD;
of him* for she felt that once to accuse him would be to&#xD;
impose upon her the necessity of breaking with him. How&#xD;
could she, in honor, marry a man to-morrow whom to-day&#xD;
she had accused of treachery ?-.besides, she was not sure-.&#xD;
could never be sure of his moral dereliction. And while&#xD;
there was a doubt in his favor, she must conquer or&#xD;
conceal all suspicion,.. oi', letting escape, must break with&#xD;
him, even at this last moment--.-must break with him for-&#xD;
ever! At least so her high spirit' and her pride argued.&#xD;
She could not part with him-pride forbade that also.-.&#xD;
What! the marriage of Miss Clifton of Clifton broken off at&#xD;
"the last moment, and all about a mountain-girl ~ Pah!&#xD;
Forbid it, all the shades of all the buried Cliftons! Hearts&#xD;
might break, but haughty heads must not be bowed! Bet-&#xD;
ter lost peace than lost place! And then ~he loved him !-.&#xD;
loved him the deeper for suppressing all signs of love !-and&#xD;
she could not bear to lose him! And banish him she must,&#xD;
if she should once betray the jealous passion of her heart.&#xD;
This mighty motive kept down the rising storm. Yet all,&#xD;
depended upon her vigilant self-control. Should a look, a&#xD;
word of suspicion, escape her then, she felt the curbed frenzy&#xD;
of her soul would have broken all bounds~ even as by the&#xD;
smallest fracture in the dyke, the mighty and irresistible 'sea&#xD;
is let in upon the land, carrying destruction and death before&#xD;
it! All depended on her silence. So, to keep her lover&#xD;
from noticing her mood,-.or fatally inquiring its cause-and&#xD;
to give him employment, she pushed the pile of handkerchiefs&#xD;
towards him, saying calmly-...&#xD;
"Mark them for me."&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
Clifton smilingly took them, found the little vial of inde1i~&#xD;
ble ink; and went to work-himself well pleased to have&#xD;
some service to perform for his liege lady, that would, with-&#xD;
out disrespect to her, deliver him from the duty of keeping&#xD;
up a running conversation, for 'which he felt indisposed.&#xD;
She need not have feared that Archer Clifton would oh-&#xD;
serve her mood. He himself. was too abstracted, too thought-&#xD;
ful, to be critical or inquisitive. He was deeply troubled by&#xD;
the recollection of the conversations of the afternoon, affect.&#xD;
ing Kate Ravanagh. Instead of benefiting, had he really&#xD;
wronged that excellent girl ?-~~darkened the very morning&#xD;
of her just opening life with the clouds of suspicion? And&#xD;
was even )ais mother's protection insufficient to shield her in~&#xD;
nocence from such attacks of slander? Yes !-for the fact&#xD;
of his mother's protection was not even acknowledged.&#xD;
Slander shuts its eyes to truth, while it opens its lips to false.&#xD;
hood.. Should he send her back to the mountain, and expose&#xD;
her to all the evils of that life? No, no !-his whole heart&#xD;
protested against that course. Yet what to do to save her?&#xD;
He could not decide then. He could not even get his own&#xD;
consent to consult his mother. What! wound her ear with&#xD;
the repetition of such a story? Never! His usual prompti-&#xD;
tude of decision and action forsook him quite. A cry was&#xD;
in his heart, and he could only repeat to himself her name&#xD;
in deep sorrow,-" Oh, Kate! Kate! Kate Kavanagh !"&#xD;
until her very name" Kate Kavanagh," became the refrain&#xD;
of a plaintive silent melody! Meantime he pursued his oc-&#xD;
cupation quite mechanically, marking and laying down, One by&#xD;
one, the handkerchiefs, until the whole dozen was complete.&#xD;
Carolyn Clifton watched his complete and mournful abstrac-&#xD;
tion with increasing suspicion.&#xD;
When all the handkerchiefs were marked,' he took the&#xD;
parcel, and shaking off sad thought, smilingly laid them be-&#xD;
fore his lady's eyes, gayly entreating her to examine his work,&#xD;
and reward him with a kindly word if it should please her.&#xD;
Miss Clifton~ took up the parcel, her eyes fell npon the&#xD;
topmost handkerchief, and she started violently. She swiftly&#xD;
turned it over and looked at the second, and the blood rushed&#xD;
to her brow! At the third, and it receded again, leaving&#xD;
her pale~ as death! She hurriedly went through the dozen,&#xD;
t1~en springing to her feet, she hurled the parcel to the floor,&#xD;

&#xD;
and setting her heel upon it, lifted her proud form to its&#xD;
loftiest height, and stood, her chest expanded, her. head&#xD;
thrown hack, her cheek kindling, her .eyes blazing,-full!&#xD;
full !-yet proudly suppressing all utterance of passion!&#xD;
Captain Clifton st rted to his feet, exclaiming-&#xD;
"Carolyn, my dear cousin&#xD;
But spurning the parcel beneath her heel, she turned im-&#xD;
periously away, and walked up the room.&#xD;
He followed her, repeating-&#xD;
"Carolyn, my dearest Carolyn! what is it ?"&#xD;
Turnjng and flashing upon him her fierce, imperious eyes,&#xD;
she stretched out her arm, and pointed in scornful silence to&#xD;
the handkerchiefs on the floor.&#xD;
ile went and picked them up to examine them. Oh!&#xD;
treacherous absence of mind! Oh! fatal refrain of the&#xD;
mental melody! Oh! horror of horrors! Catastrophe of&#xD;
catasti~ophes! Upon every handkerchief was beautifully&#xD;
marked-" KATE KAVANAGH."&#xD;
"Confirmation strong&#xD;
As proof from Lioly Writ."&#xD;
Ay, and a great deal stronger, as sight is more convincing&#xD;
than faith! What. was to be done? It was in vain to deny&#xD;
or attempt to explain it! Yet he must try, even if he should&#xD;
make himself ridiculous. Hurling the fatal "haudker~hiefs"&#xD;
down with virulence, he sprang to the side of the outraged~&#xD;
and indignant beauty; ~eized her 'hand, exclaiming, vehe-&#xD;
mently-&#xD;
"My dearest love-pardon! pardon! This is all a mis-&#xD;
take !"&#xD;
Spurning his clasp from her hand, she turned away in&#xD;
arrogant silence.&#xD;
Dropping upon one knee, he took her hand again, and&#xD;
looking up in her face, said, in a voice of entreaty-&#xD;
"My Carolyn! this is all a mistake !-the most absurd&#xD;
mistake! The effect of the merest absence of mind! The&#xD;
most ridiculous thing !"&#xD;
"Oh, sir !" she answered, with slow and withering scorn,&#xD;
drawing her hand away again, "I do not doubt it was a mis-&#xD;
take. I never supposed you would dare an intentional insult&#xD;
to my father's daughter !"&#xD;

"But, Carolyn, my dearest cousin, only permit me to ex-&#xD;

"Oh, sir, I treatet you spare me the humiliation of hear-&#xD;
ing the story !" she sneered, with curling lip.&#xD;
"But, Carolyn, my dear, loved bride! My bride, that&#xD;
will be, to-morrow-if you will allow me to tell you all the&#xD;
simple truth-.--the reason why this young girl's name ran in&#xD;
my head so."&#xD;
"Oh, sir !" she exclaimed, raising both hands, and turning&#xD;
away her head in loathing-" I implore you !-I most humbly&#xD;
beseech you to forbear! Spare me details that might shock&#xD;
my-delicacy !"&#xD;
- "Carolyn," he said, gravely and reproachfully rising, and&#xD;
taking her hand-" this does not become you."&#xD;
Throwing off his hand, with scorn and indignation, she&#xD;
replied..-.&#xD;
"It would less become me, sir, to listen to the history you&#xD;
would tell !" Then subsiding into a mood of contemptuous&#xD;
irony, she said, with a sneering smile-" Believe me, sir, I&#xD;
feel more disgusted at your bad taste than shocked at your&#xD;
sin, or wronged by your bad faith. .~q mowntain-girl!&#xD;
Truly, I am humiliated to think so base a rival should have&#xD;
moved we-even to contempt. I am dishonored, sir, in that.&#xD;
Iliad your wandering fancy fixed upon one of my cousins-&#xD;
one of the elegant Misses Cabell, I might have mourned your&#xD;
infidelity, but should have been saved this deep humiliation&#xD;
for myself, and this utter contempt for you-but a mountain-&#xD;
girl! A coarse, ignorant, ill-bred mountain-girl! 0/i-/i-A!&#xD;
that you should have.stooped, or I should have been moved,&#xD;
by so low a creature as that! I could bury my head with&#xD;

"Carolyn!" he said, sternly, "permit me to inform you-"&#xD;
"No, siu !" she exclaimed, scorn writhing her lips, indig-&#xD;
nation flashing from her eyes-" JN~o, sn~! You shall tell&#xD;
me NOTHING! It would ill-become my mother's daughter to&#xD;
listen to the revolting history of-your base amour with the&#xD;
mountain-girl !"&#xD;
Yes, in the bitterness ~f her passion, she forgot her maiden&#xD;
delicacy, and spoke those shameful words to his astonished&#xD;
ears!&#xD;
"Miss Clifton !" he replied, severely, folding his arms,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
and gazing sternly and steadily into her blushing face-for&#xD;
she was already blushing for her temerity-until she quailed&#xD;
before him-" Miss Clifton, you mistake my purpose-I have&#xD;
no intention, now, to explain anything-the man who would&#xD;
condescend' to deny so base a crime 'as you have charged upon&#xD;
me-is not too high or pure to commit it. Therefore, I deign&#xD;
to say nothing for myself. 'But for the admirable girl that&#xD;
you have slandered-I will say this: Had a man dared to&#xD;
asperse the fair fame of Catherine Kavanagh-though that&#xD;
wan had been my bosom friend-he should have expiated his&#xD;
falsehood with his life :-Had any other woman breathed a&#xD;
breath of slander on her-her husband or her father should&#xD;
have atoned for the fault :-For yourself, Miss 'Clifton-you&#xD;
shall retract your words, before ever I shall call you wife!"&#xD;
This roused her passion to ungovernable fury. Turning&#xD;
ghastly white, while the light seemed to leap from her eyes,&#xD;
she exclaimed, in a low, deep, intense tone-&#xD;
"DEATH, sir! Do you threaten me? Insult me in my&#xD;
father's house? Leave it! You are unworthy to stand&#xD;
upon this floor! BEGONE !" And reaching out her hand,&#xD;
she seized the bell cord, and rang a peal that presently&#xD;
brought a servant to the door. The advent ofa third party,&#xD;
though that party was a menial, constrained the lady to' re-&#xD;
member herself. Miss Clifton was her cold, serene, dignified&#xD;
self again. Turning to the servant, she said, haughtily,&#xD;
"Show Captain Clifton to the front door, and bring round&#xD;
his horse, instantly. He returns to Hardbargain, to-night."&#xD;
And she bowed to Clifton, and calmly and imperiously walked&#xD;
from the room.&#xD;
The man stood waiting and bowing. Captain Clifton&#xD;
snatched his hat, saying-&#xD;
"Let my horse be brought round, without delay, Damiy,&#xD;
and tell your master, when he returns, that he shall hear&#xD;
from me at Hardbargain."&#xD;
When the man had bowed and retired, Captain Clifton&#xD;
passed out through the open leaf of the window, into the&#xD;
piazza, and thence down into the lawn, to speak to Frank,&#xD;
who was just entering from the 'gai'den with Mrs. Clifton on&#xD;
his arm.&#xD;
Georgia saw at a glance, that her train of gunpowder had&#xD;
caught, and the magazine had blown tip, and her dark, beau-&#xD;

tiful, demoniac, witching face lighted up with a lurid joy for&#xD;
one unguarded instant, and then all was self-recollection,&#xD;
self-control, and sweet, smooth, serene, alluring glamour.&#xD;
Bowing deeply to Mrs. Clifton, he said-&#xD;
"Madam, an unexpected event sends me from Clifton this&#xD;
evening. Pray make my adicus to my uncle and cousin.&#xD;
And permit me to commend my friend here to your hospi-&#xD;
table care until such time as he pleases to become my guest&#xD;
at'Hardbargain-if, indeed, he will not ride thither with me&#xD;
to night," he added, turning to Frank.&#xD;
Fairfax was too surprised to speak.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton, who was not surprised at all, yet affected&#xD;
much interest, said, archly-&#xD;
"Oh, but we shall see you back very early to-morrow&#xD;
1~~&#xD;
morning.&#xD;
"I regret to add, madam, that it is not likely," he said,&#xD;
with another bow; then turning to Frank, he asked-&#xD;
"Will you ride with me to-night, Fairfax ~"&#xD;
Frank glanced at tho lady on his arm, and then looking&#xD;
rebukingly at Clifton, begged to be excused.&#xD;
"Well, then, you are my guest, Fairfax, and my mother&#xD;
has often pressed you to give her a few weeks of your com-&#xD;
pany. Join me at Hardbargain as soon as possible-the&#xD;
soorfer the better. To-morrow even-"&#xD;
"To~morrow!" archly smiled the wily lady. Tomorrow,&#xD;
I Cancy, his attendance and your own will be required here.&#xD;
Do you forget ?-Well, that is the worst instance of absence&#xD;
of mind I ever saw or heard of! A young bridegroom to&#xD;
forget, for an instant, his wedding-day! Too bad, even for&#xD;
you, the notoriously-absent-minded Archer Clifton !".&#xD;
Not wishing to enter into explanations, Captain Clifton&#xD;
merely replied with another bow-a most convenient, safe&#xD;
and polite manner of answer, since, without lack of&#xD;
it committed nothing.                -       courtesy,&#xD;
Then, taking leave of both lady and gentleman, and re-&#xD;
peating his invitation to Frank, he turned and went to take&#xD;
his horse from the servant that held it, threw himself up into&#xD;
the saddle, and, with a parting wave of his hat, rode away at~&#xD;
full speed.&#xD;
"Clifton looks darkly-what can be the matter P' asked&#xD;
Frank.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
ifJl&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, nothing! probably Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain,&#xD;
has been troubled with some refractory servant, and has sent&#xD;
for her son to come up and reduce him to order-or possibly&#xD;
there may be some dispute or difficulty in settling the de~&#xD;
inands of the hired harvest hands. They are often even&#xD;
dishonest in their extortions."&#xD;
"Deferring to your bettQr judgment, madam, still, I fear&#xD;
not! I think such trifles would scarcely have raised so dark&#xD;
a thunder-cloud upon Clifton's brow," said Frank.&#xD;
"Oh, well! At worst it is but sonic lover's quarrel with&#xD;
his most exacting queen, Carolyn !" playfully replied the&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
Frank was not satisfied-he was pained. This most dan-&#xD;
gerous dark beauty fascinated and frightened him by turns.&#xD;
He had never seen the fiend in her face since that first night,&#xD;
and her witching power had almost erased the remembrance&#xD;
of it from his mind. Indeed, if he had ever recollected it, it&#xD;
was with wonder and remorse that he should have ever read&#xD;
such fearful meaning in a lady's frown, and he ascribed it to&#xD;
the phantasmagoria of his own fatigued nerves and over~&#xD;
excited brain. But now he felt vaguely anxious, suspicious,&#xD;
foreboding-he scarce knew wtierefore. He had no reason&#xD;
to reply to the lady again, for at the instant she finished&#xD;
speaking, the carriages drove into the yard, bringing the&#xD;
company from Hardbargain, and they walked forward to&#xD;
welcome them home.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
THE SEVERED HEARTS.&#xD;
Alas! how slight a cause may move&#xD;
Dissension between hearts that love-  A.&#xD;
Hearts that the world in vain had tried,&#xD;
And sorrow but more closely tied;&#xD;
That stood the storm when waves wera rough,&#xD;
Yet in a sunny hour fell ofi;&#xD;
Like ships that have gone down at sea,&#xD;
When Heaven was all tranquillity!&#xD;
A something light as air-a lo6k-&#xD;
A word unkind or wrongly taken;&#xD;
Oh, love that tempests never shook,&#xD;
A breath-a touch like this hath shaken.-MooaE.&#xD;
So1~iE hours after the arrival of the company, old Mr.&#xD;
Clifton sat alone in his study, examining piles of accounts,&#xD;
merchants', mechanics', and hired laborers' bills, that had&#xD;
come in as usual upon the first of July, many weeks before,&#xD;
yet had not, up to this night, been settled. For many years&#xD;
past the financial affairs of the Master of Clifton had been&#xD;
falling behiudhand. The cause of ths was that no planta-&#xD;
tion and plantation house can thoroughly succeed without&#xD;
the personal superintendency of an efficient mistress to assist&#xD;
the master's effort. Often, indeed, it happens, that while&#xD;
the master himself is engaged in state politics, or off at the&#xD;
legislature, or at congress, or on the circuit as a.judge of the&#xD;
court, or in the metropolis of the state, or of the nation,&#xD;
holding some high office under the government-the mistress,&#xD;
at home upon the plantation, is the main-spring of all its&#xD;
business-superintending........not only the house and house-&#xD;
maids, with their multifarious cares and avocations, suc1~ as&#xD;
a city housewife cannot conceive of, but managing the planta-&#xD;
tion also-keeping the overseer to his duty, adjudging&#xD;
equitably all difficulties that may arise between him and the&#xD;
slaves under his charge-looking over all the numerous&#xD;
accounts, paying debts, and, when necessary, retrenching&#xD;
&#xD;
J&#xD;
}&#xD;
&#xD;
expenses. Now the Clifton plantation had been singularly&#xD;
unfortunate in a series of inefficient mistresses, even before&#xD;
it foil in regular succession to the present Mr. Clifton. And&#xD;
after that, affairs were worse than ever. His first wife, the&#xD;
haughty Miss 0-ower, the mother of Carolyn, was far too&#xD;
groat a lady to look after a housekeeper and overseer, and&#xD;
her successors had been all rung girls, very worthless, ex-&#xD;
cept as pets and playthings, and who had, besides, to be&#xD;
indulged every year with their winters in Richmond, or in&#xD;
Washington-a two-fold evil, as it took the master from his&#xD;
plantation and men, and the mistress from her house and&#xD;
maids, and laid them, besides, under the heavy expense of&#xD;
city hotel living, dressing, dinner-giving, theatres, balls,&#xD;
concerts, etc. Once in awhile, as a bridal treat, or at the&#xD;
successive "comiii~ out" of daughters, a winter in the me-&#xD;
tropolis may be well enough. But when continued year&#xD;
after year, through a lifetime, to the total neglect of the&#xD;
plantation, the revenues of no ordinary estate will hold out.&#xD;
So it followed, that as the master and mistress ceased to&#xD;
look after the overseer and the housekeeper, the overseer&#xD;
and housekeeper ceased to look after the men and maids,&#xD;
and the men and maids grew careless and indolent in the&#xD;
performance of their duties. Thus, as the expenses rose,&#xD;
the income fell. And thus, at the present time, old Mr.&#xD;
Clifton was almost irredeemably in debt, and all the Clifton&#xD;
property, except the land, mortgaged to its full value. The&#xD;
mortgage might foreclose at any instant. And at this pre-&#xD;
sent moment, the poor old master of great Clifton had not&#xD;
the ready money to pay his harvest hands. The extent of&#xD;
his liabilities was, however, so little known in the neighbor-&#xD;
hood, that his credit was still good, and almost high-and&#xD;
the estate of White Cliffs was' still considered as one of the&#xD;
most prosperous in the county, and the owners still held as&#xD;
very enviable people. While old Mr. Clifton sat pondering&#xD;
most dismall~r over his impracticable accounts, the study&#xD;
door was suddenly thrown open, and Miss Clifton entered,&#xD;
in great excitement, and threw herself into a chair before&#xD;
her father, exclaiming-&#xD;
"Father, I have been insulted !"&#xD;
The old man, never indifferent to his children's cry-ever&#xD;
ready in the midst of his own real cares, to hear and sympa'&#xD;

papers in perplexity, inquiring-&#xD;
"What is it 3 What did you say, my child 3"&#xD;
"I have been insulted !-outragcd sir !"&#xD;
The old man gazed at her in surprise, repeating......&#xD;
Insulted, outraged!"'&#xD;
"Yes, sir! contended, despised, scorned, insulted, out-&#xD;
raged, rejected!"              /&#xD;
The old man placed his hands upon the arms of the chair,&#xD;
and gazed in astonishment, exclaiming......&#xD;
Insulted !~-outraged!' Whom 3 You, my daughter!&#xD;
Miss Clifton! Impossible."&#xD;
"Yes, sir! me, your daughter-Carolyn Clifton!"&#xD;
"Who has presumed-who has dared- 3"&#xD;
"Captain Clifton, sir, 'has dared!"' ~ep1ied the indig-&#xD;
nant beauty, rising in her excitement.&#xD;
The old gentleman stared at her in blank wonder for a&#xD;
minute, and then-taking her hand-&#xD;
"Sit down-..sit dowr~-.--sit down-sit down," he kept' re-&#xD;
peating, "and tell me ~all about it."&#xD;
Carolyn drank a glass of ice water that stood near her on&#xD;
the table, and then, in a cooler manner, told her father ex-&#xD;
actly what had passed, and how it had finally ended.&#xD;
The old gentleman scratched his snow-white head in vex-&#xD;
ation and perplexity, but the winter bloom of his broad, rosy&#xD;
face, was neither heightened nor lowered at the hearing of&#xD;
the tale. He did not by any means display the indignation&#xD;
the offended beauty had expected.&#xD;
"Well, sir!" at last she said, rather haughtily, "what do&#xD;
you say to this 3"&#xD;
He put his arm fondly around her waist, and drew her to&#xD;
him, saying, caressingly-&#xD;
" You're a fool, Carolyn ! A vain, jealous little fool,&#xD;
that's all! Nay, now !-no airs with your old father! Ac-&#xD;
cording to your own showing, it has been Archer that has&#xD;
been condemnedd, despised, scorned, insulted, outraged, re-&#xD;
jected!' and the rest of it-and upon no just grounds, either!&#xD;
as I can easily prove to you. I am very much mortified-&#xD;
deeply humbled, indeed, to hear that my daughter, a high-&#xD;
born young maiden, should have forgotten her feminine pride&#xD;
arid delicacy, and reproached her lover with an intimacy with&#xD;
&#xD;
a ~ountaiflgirla race of women, with very few exceptions,&#xD;
so low and wretched, that a young lady should ignore their&#xD;
very existence. Oh, my conscience, Carolyn! why do you&#xD;
not cover your face, and die with humiliation 3 I do not&#xD;
wonder a man of such high honor and delicate sensibility as&#xD;
Archer Clifton, should have been shocked and disgusted.&#xD;
Nay, my child !-no airs with me! No tossing of the head,&#xD;
and curling of the lip with me! I am your father. You&#xD;
must listen to me. You have done Archer the most out-&#xD;
rageous injustice. And your jealousy is as ridiculous as it is&#xD;
indelicate. In the first place, this girl, though brought up&#xD;
on the mountain, comes of respectable, if humble parentage,&#xD;
and possesses, by all accounts, a higher toned moral and in-&#xD;
tellectual nature than most young ladies are endowed with.&#xD;
She is as far removed from vice as my own Carolyn! In the&#xD;
second place, she is the prot~g6 of Mrs. Clifton, as well as&#xD;
of Captain Clifton, and enjoys that excellent lady's esteem&#xD;
and friendship, spending half of every day in her company,&#xD;
except when visitors are at the house.. In the third and last&#xD;
place, she is not a beautiful woman, but an ugly child-being&#xD;
scarcely fourteen years of age, and having the ugliest face I&#xD;
ever saw in my life-at least I think so, though Mrs. Clifton&#xD;
says it is a noble face. It has large features, and is full of&#xD;
strength and expression, like a boy's. There, now, that's&#xD;
all! Now! what do you think of yourself 3"&#xD;
During this short explanation, Carolyn's beautiful counte-&#xD;
nance had changed expression as rapidly and as variously as&#xD;
during the lay of the minstrel the harp changes and varies&#xD;
its notes. At its close she dropped down by the side of the&#xD;
old man, and throwing her arms and her head upon his knees,&#xD;
in utter weakness and dejection, sobbed-&#xD;
"Father! how shall I ever be forgiven 3"&#xD;
He raised her to his knee, and putting his arm around her&#xD;
waist, drew her head upon his bosom, and said-&#xD;
"It is an ugly lover's quarrel, certainly, my love! And&#xD;
Archer Clifton is as proud as you are! But itmust be made&#xD;
up! It must be made up! A very ugly quarrel, indeed!&#xD;
And on the eve of your marriage',,too! iRut it must be made&#xD;
up! It must be made up! Ah, doubtless he will be. over&#xD;
to-morrow night! He~ feels as bad as you do, I'll warrant&#xD;

he does! I'll warrant he does! I ~iiusAd, I know, if 1&#xD;
wore he !"&#xD;
"Ah,'father! no he does not! ITo was in the right! [&#xD;
was in the wrong !"&#xD;
"Yes! you were wrong, Carry! And I hope it will be a&#xD;
lesson to you! But that~ makes n~ difference in his feelings,&#xD;
not a whit! He suffers as much as you do! Why, whei~ I&#xD;
have a ditliculty with my poor little pet, Georgia, if she is&#xD;
ever so 'wrong, and I ever so right, I am nevertheless the&#xD;
most miserable ivan alive!"&#xD;
"Ah, father, but there is a great difference-I am not&#xD;
Archer's pet, but was to be his consort. We-Archer and&#xD;
myself, are nearly equal in station, ay, education, disposi-&#xD;
tion, and so are more responsible for our conduct towards&#xD;
each other !"' sighed Carolyn, dropping her head dejectedly&#xD;
upon his bosoni.&#xD;
"Oh, well! now if you are~ so full of doubts and fears!&#xD;
it is but ten o'clock! I will mount my horse, and ride up to&#xD;
Hardbarg4n, and knock the young gentleman up-I doubt&#xD;
if he is asleep !-and bring him back here, to-night!"&#xD;
"Not for the world! Not for ten thousand worlds !" ex-&#xD;
claimed the proud girl, vehemently.&#xD;
"Ah, then I don't know what to do with you-go to bed,&#xD;
and try to sleep, and if you can't do that, ring for the house-&#xD;
keeper, and make her give you some of her nostrums, to put'&#xD;
you to sleep! And go into a state of non-existence, that&#xD;
shall obliterate the time between this and to-morrow morn-&#xD;
ing. And to-morrow, I'll warrant Archer will be here to&#xD;
breakfast with us, and to beg your pardon for the sins that&#xD;
you 'committed! for that's the en4 ~of all lovers' quarrels!&#xD;
No m~t~ter who's right and who's' wrqi~g-who's sinned&#xD;
against, and who's sinning, the genthinian has tod~ the pen-&#xD;
ance! There! kiss me, and be off with you !-~-and hark ye,&#xD;
Carolyn! don't forget to kneel down and prayileaven to&#xD;
give you the grace of a meeker temper !"&#xD;
Carolyn 'Clifton went to her room and retired to bed, to&#xD;
heat her pillow with her feverish head, to wet it with her&#xD;
~hot tears-to sigh, an4 groan, and toss, and sob all night.&#xD;
This bitter, bitter quarrel,"was the first trouble, the girl had&#xD;
evor had in all her favored life. And she was impatient&#xD;
&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
with it, indignant at it. She was angry with herself for her&#xD;
injustice and indelicacy; angrywith Clifton for not forcing&#xD;
upon' her the explanation she would not consent to receive,&#xD;
but which, had she been forced to hear, would have arrested&#xD;
the quarrel, and saved this' cruel suffering; angry at the to-&#xD;
dious night, that lingered so long, keeping her in agonizing&#xD;
suspense ;*rngry at the morning, that delayed its coming,&#xD;
and bringing her the peace and joy of a reconciliation. ~And&#xD;
so she tossed, and groaned, and 'suffered, like one in high&#xD;
fever, while tb~e long, long night was slowly, slowly passing&#xD;
away.&#xD;
In. the meantime Captain Clifton had ridden away~ not so&#xD;
angry as shocked, repulsed and alienated by the unprece-&#xD;
dented behaviour of his lady-love. He disliked all demon-&#xD;
strations of emotion, and detested all exhibitions of evil&#xD;
passion in a woman. It was the high-bred delicacy and re-&#xD;
finement-the queenly placidity-the cool reserve and stately&#xD;
~dignity of Carolyn Clifton, 'that had attracted his first admi~&#xD;
ration. And though he 'sometimes gallantly complained of&#xD;
her cruelty, he would not have had her manner one degree&#xD;
warmer. But now this fair, cool, peerless queen o'er her-&#xD;
self and her emotions, had yielded to passions that might&#xD;
govern a serving-maid-to suspicion, 3ealou5y, and fierce&#xD;
auger-had descended to viruler~t, vituperative abuse! And,&#xD;
henceforth, ~he was dis~rowned, and degraded from her pride&#xD;
of place.&#xD;
He arrived at Hardbargain-gave his horse in charge of&#xD;
a servant, and entered the house.&#xD;
The candles werejuBt lighted in, the parlor, and Mrs. Clif-.&#xD;
ton and her favorite Kate sat sewing by the work-stand. As&#xD;
he entered; Kate arose as usual with the intention of with-&#xD;
drawing, but he signed to her' with hishand, and said in a&#xD;
tone of command-&#xD;
"No-stay, Catherine, and once for all give up that habit&#xD;
of retiring as soon as myself or any other visitor enters."&#xD;
The young girl returned to her seat and resumed her Work.&#xD;
Then with a sort of spirit of persecution upon him, as one&#xD;
would think, he went' to the maiden and inquired, impa-&#xD;
tiently--.-&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
* "Why do you always do that! Why do you always rise&#xD;
and leave as soon as any one enters the room !"&#xD;
She glanced up at him with those large, shy eyes, and in~&#xD;
stantly veiled them again; while the blush 4eepened on her&#xD;
cheek. Her heart-her disobedient, rebellious heart that&#xD;
would not be calm when she bade it-was beating fast against&#xD;
her bosom, as it ever beat, when he looked at h4 or spoke&#xD;
to her. To have saved her soul alive, she could not have&#xD;
put her niotive into words, and told him that she ever feared&#xD;
her society, or even her presence, might not be as acceptable&#xD;
to Mrs. Clifton's visitors as it was to that kind lady herself.&#xD;
She only bowed her head and blushed the deeper that she&#xD;
could not answer, and yet deeper still, that she felt him&#xD;
gazing on her. He was gazing on her !-gazing down on&#xD;
that beautiful, dark auburn hair, rippling and glittering under&#xD;
the light of the lamp-on that broad monarchal forehead, on&#xD;
those even eyebrows and long eyelashes, dropping fine&#xD;
shadows on the glowing cheek-yes! gazing and thinking of&#xD;
Major Cabell's enthusiastic admiration, and wondering why&#xD;
all the world did not agree with him in thinking that counte-~&#xD;
nance grandly beautiful! Yet even while admiring her so&#xD;
much, he spoke angrily, and said-&#xD;
"Catherine! You have a second habit even worse than&#xD;
the first! Lately you have taken up the practice of not re-&#xD;
plying to me when I ask you a questipn-~...~and when you are&#xD;
obliged to raise your eyes to mine, you drop them instantly&#xD;
as if mine burnt them. Now I have always disliked and&#xD;
suspected eyes that cannot look freely into other eyes !"&#xD;
At this the very forehead of the girl burned with a crimson&#xD;
flush. Cliftor~ took hold of her hand, which fluttered in his&#xD;
own like a frightened bird, and said, in a kinder tone-&#xD;
"Come, my child! see now if you can look me honestly&#xD;
in the face, and tell me why you will not talk to me!"&#xD;
But Kate's distress became so great that Mrs. Clifton in-&#xD;
terposed, and said-&#xD;
"Do, Archer, leave her alone! It does seem to me, son,&#xD;
that you take a malicious pleasure in tormenting that poor&#xD;
girl because she is so shy! Don't mind him; Kate! lie has&#xD;
been a tease ever since he was a boy, when he used to pull&#xD;
the ears of kittens and puppy dogs. Take up your work,&#xD;
child, and hurry on with it. And you, Archer! I am as&#xD;
&#xD;
much surprised as pleased to see you back here to-night. To&#xD;
what am I indebted for the pleasure !"&#xD;
"My dear mother, I will tell you after awhile-let me be&#xD;
quiet now a little time."&#xD;
And Mrs. Clifton looked up in surprise, and noticed, for&#xD;
the first time, how deeply troubled was Archer Clifton's face.&#xD;
After watAflg him a few minutes as he sat and watched&#xD;
Kate, she said, suddenly-&#xD;
"Oh! I have a letter for you-arrived by the afternoon&#xD;
mail. Henry brought it from the post-office this evening&#xD;
after you left. Perhaps it was in quest of that you came,&#xD;
and its contents may dispel your uneasiness," and rising, the&#xD;
lady went to the card rack, hanging above the mantle-piece,&#xD;
and brought him a letter, which he tore open and read hastily.&#xD;
Then starting up, he exclaimed, "Good! Good! Most ex-&#xD;
cellent, most opportune !"&#xD;
"What is it, my dear Archer! II am very glad it gives&#xD;
you such satisfaction, at any rate! What is it !"&#xD;
"An order from head-quarters to join my regiment imme-&#xD;
diately, to take command of a detachment to march within&#xD;
ten days for the Indian frontier-to put down an insurrec-&#xD;
tion there !"&#xD;
"No !" exclaimed the lady, in amazement.&#xD;
"Yes, indeed, my good mother !" replied Archer Clifton,&#xD;
exultingly.&#xD;
"Xe! You astonish me! Ordered upon active duty~-~&#xD;
upon distant and dangerous service at the very time you are&#xD;
about to be married! Call you that opportune~-fortunate!&#xD;
I call it most inopportune, unfortunate !"&#xD;
"Ah! madam, you do not know! What, and if my mar~&#xD;
riage were already broken off! Is it not lucky-I mean&#xD;
providential, that I can join my regiment immediately, and&#xD;
depart for a distant scene, and active service, in which I may&#xD;
forget the sorrow and the humiliation!"&#xD;
"Your marriage broken off! What! Now, at the last&#xD;
moment! A marriage that has been looked forward to for&#xD;
so many years! To be broken off when every thing is ready!&#xD;
Impossible, it cannot be !"&#xD;
"I assure you upon my word, madam, it is but too&#xD;
true !"&#xD;
"Why-what--do you tell me 3" exclaimed the lady, in&#xD;

increasing astonishment. "When did it happen 3 What&#xD;
caused it 3 Had Mr. Clifton anything to do with it 3"&#xD;
"It happened this evening after my return to Clifton. Mr.&#xD;
Clifton had nothing whatever to do with it-not having&#xD;
reached home at the time it occurred. It was occasioned by&#xD;
a most humiliating quarrel between myself and Miss Clifton !"&#xD;
"Oh, a quarrel! A lovers' quarrel! That ~ nothing!&#xD;
Though, in truth, it surprises me that the calm, proud Caro-&#xD;
lyn should descend to such' a thing, as it does that my own&#xD;
son should deign to take a part in it. But it is really no-&#xD;
thing! Such things occur in almost every courtship !"&#xD;
"And those who quarrel in courtship should never venture&#xD;
upon matrimony."&#xD;
"Ah ! 'that is an inhuman, unfaithful sentiment, my son!&#xD;
Young people are like other young natures, petulant, vain,&#xD;
irascible, exacting~but life trains, them into modesty, so-&#xD;
briety, forbearance. For this quarrel, Archer, it must be&#xD;
adjusted! It shall be to-morrow morning!"&#xD;
"No, madam, it shall not! ' This quarrel is irreconcilable,&#xD;
believe me !"&#xD;
"Pooh, pooh! What! with Carolyn? Nonsense !"&#xD;
"Mother! you shall judge! She has descended from her&#xD;
high place of maidenly pride and delicacy, and betraying the&#xD;
most revolting phases of suspicion, jealousy and fierce anger;&#xD;
she has charged me with infidelity, base treachery and vice !"&#xD;
"Dreadful! dreadful! as all angry words and acts ever&#xD;
are! But not unpardonable! Spoken in the frenz of as-&#xD;
sion-~--they will be retracted to-morrow! And then you must&#xD;
be reconciled. Things must go on as they have been planned.&#xD;
There must beno discreditable exposure of this affray. The&#xD;
marriage must take place, as proposed, to-morrow evening.&#xD;
Then, if you must join your regiment, why it will be easily&#xD;
understood that you must. And there will be no reproach&#xD;
under those circumstances in leaving your newly wedded&#xD;
bride under her father's protection !"&#xD;
"Impossible, madam! Miss Clifton has to-night exhibited&#xD;
her character and disposition in such revolting colors, that I&#xD;
can never, never take her to my bosom !"&#xD;
"You are angry now, Archer! You will think better of&#xD;
it! I trust in Heaven you may do so before there is an ex-&#xD;
posure. Think what will be the astonishment of the wed-&#xD;

in&#xD;
&#xD;
dingConiPanY who will assemble to-morrow evening-the&#xD;
mortification of the family at Clifton, and worse than all, the&#xD;
scandal! the nine days wonder !"&#xD;
~ thought my dear mother had too strong a mind to fear&#xD;
these bugbears of the little, when a just occasion for meeting&#xD;
ILnd braving them occurs.&#xD;
"But I do not consider this an adequate occasion. That&#xD;
this quarrel will be finally adjusted, I firmly believe. And&#xD;
I think it a pity and a shame that to-morrow evening, three&#xD;
hundred guests should be disappointed and dispersed, to&#xD;
spread a subject of speculation and scandal all over the&#xD;
country. And this merely because you will yet a little&#xD;
longer indulge your anger ~',&#xD;
"I' am not angry, mother. If I were only angry I should&#xD;
let the marriage go on, if Miss Clifton thought proper to do&#xD;
so, for I should know that my anger would pass away. No,&#xD;
I am 'not angry, mother, but shocked, repulsed, and totally&#xD;
estranged. I could no more marry Miss Clifton now, than t&#xD;
could take any other loathed object to my bosom! The idea&#xD;
makes me shudder !"&#xD;
"Still I affirm that all this is intense anger, nothing else!&#xD;
and that there will come a reaction. Why in anger, Archer,&#xD;
the object is as much loathed as in love it is desired-but&#xD;
1/tat is temporary, and this, I hope% you will find permanent.&#xD;
I hope, at bott&amp;amp;ni, you respect Carolyn 3 I esteem her. She&#xD;
has been a spoiled child, but has so many undeveloped good&#xD;
qualities, that she only wants the discipline of a little affec-&#xD;
tion to make her a very excellent woman. I shall say no&#xD;
more about this affair to-night, but wait t6 see what disposi-&#xD;
tion I shall find you in to-morrow 1"&#xD;
At this moment there was a knock at the door, and instantly&#xD;
afterwards Ilenny came in and informed her mistress that Mr.&#xD;
Kavanagh had come to take his sister home&#xD;
"Ask Mr. Kavanagh to sit down in the hall. Put up&#xD;
your sewing, Catherine, my dear?' said the lady.&#xD;
Catherine arose to fol~l up her work, while Captain Clifton&#xD;
looked very much as if he would like to stop her agaIn.&#xD;
"Does she not remain with you at night madam 3"&#xD;
"Certainly not-her brother always comes for her at bed~&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"How early does she come in the morning 3"&#xD;

"She never comes in the morning. Catherine has her&#xD;
own domestic affairs to attend to during the forenoon. She&#xD;
never gets here till late in the afternoon."&#xD;
"Then I shall not see her to-morrow--.-.not see her again&#xD;
for many months-.-perhaps never see her again! Come here,&#xD;
Catherine !"&#xD;
Catherine came to his side, and stood, as usual, with her&#xD;
eyes fixed up6n the ground, and her cheek painfully Ilu~hed.&#xD;
He took h~r hand and pressed it in his own, while he said-...&#xD;
"Catherine! you have heard all that passed between my..&#xD;
self and Mrs. Clifton, this evening ~"&#xD;
A quick, short, but not ungraceful nod was all her answer.&#xD;
"And you know that I am going away on a distant and&#xD;
dangerous service; I leave here very early in the morning.....&#xD;
I may never come back, Catherine," he said, slow&#xD;
at her steadily.                           ly, looking&#xD;
Her hand in his grew cold-her cheek paled-her heart&#xD;
stopped still as death-but no word did she speak in reply.&#xD;
"Catherine! before I go, I intend to give you a command......&#xD;
do you hear me ~"&#xD;
A spasmodic nod was her reply.&#xD;
"I may be gone many years. In the meanwhile you will&#xD;
grow up to womanhood, Catherine; do not have any lovers-....&#xD;
beau~r-.....as young girls call them, while I am away-and above&#xD;
all things, do not choose a husband without first consulting&#xD;
me through my mother."&#xD;
Not knowing what to reply to this, Catherine remained&#xD;
Perfectly silent.&#xD;
"Will you obey' me in this, girl ?" he asked, rather impa-&#xD;
tiently.&#xD;
A low,' earnest choking "Yes sir," was ~hei~ answer.&#xD;
"Kiss me, then! for I may never return," said Archer&#xD;
Clifton, folding her for one moment to his bosom, and press-&#xD;
ing a kiss upon her full lips.&#xD;
But her lips grew cold at the touch-her face paled and&#xD;
fell away from his bosom-her form drooped and sank back&#xD;
Over his arm, where she lay like one dead, in a swoon.&#xD;
Surprised, alarmed, Clifton raised her in both arms, and&#xD;
hastened to the lounge, where he laid her, calling to his&#xD;
mother. The lady caine forward without any trepidation,&#xD;
and bringing a bottle of Hungary water, began to chafe her&#xD;

&#xD;
temples and face, and finally gave that task to Clifton, while&#xD;
she herself loosened Kate's dress.&#xD;
"What could have been the cause of this, mother l Is&#xD;
she subject to these attacks '~"&#xD;
"I never knew her to faint before, though I have seen her&#xD;
under very trying circumstances with that old man, her&#xD;
grandfather."&#xD;
"What could have occasioned it V'&#xD;
"Why, the 8udden news of your going away on dangerous&#xD;
service, of course," said Mrs. Clifton, as she resumed the&#xD;
bottle, and continued to chafe the girl's face and hands.&#xD;
"The child loves you, Archer; she has a very grateful,&#xD;
affectionate heart, and very strong feelings. She loves us&#xD;
both. And when you bade her good-bye, for a long and&#xD;
perilous absence, is it, strange she should have been over-&#xD;
come ~ When soldiers talk of danger, children' may be&#xD;
for given for being Do go and tell Kavanagh&#xD;
frightened.&#xD;
that Kate must remain here to-night, and dismiss him."&#xD;
went, and before he came back again, Kate, with a&#xD;
ug drawn sigh, had opened her eyes and recovered.&#xD;
"You must raise her, and take her up stairs, my dear&#xD;
Archer. She must suffer no more agitation to..night,".Said&#xD;
Mrs. Olifbn.&#xD;
And he lifted the form of Catherine, and took her up stairs,&#xD;
while his mother called Ilenny. When they had laid the&#xD;
young girl on a bed, and left her to the care of Ilenny, and&#xD;
had returned to the parlor again~-.CaPtain Clifton said-&#xD;
"Mother! take care of that girl! She has been the inno-&#xD;
cent, unconscious cause of my trouble to-day, but I cannot&#xD;
feel dislike or even indifference towards her. Take care of&#xD;
that humble maidep, mother, as if she were your daughter&#xD;
~ my sister. Don't let any rustic beaux come near her,&#xD;
mother. I cannot endure the idea of her marrying, or even&#xD;
being wooed 'by any low, miserable fellow of her brother's&#xD;
grade. And do not permit any young gentleman of the&#xD;
neighborhood to trifle with her heart, or endanger her good&#xD;
name. You know how easily, even without her fault, that&#xD;
sole possession of a poor maiden is lost. The thought that&#xD;
such an unmerited misfortune should befall Kate, exasperates&#xD;
me beyond measure, and I feel like quarreling with the&#xD;
whole order of society!"&#xD;

"This from you mother!" exclaimed Archer Clifton, re~&#xD;

Mrs. Clifton, who was walking about the room, quietly set~&#xD;

smiled. And soon after she lighted a night-lamp, and&#xD;
placing it in the hand of her son, bade him good-night, and&#xD;
retired to her chamber. Captain Clifton remained pacing up&#xD;
and down the room, in troubled thought, some time after she&#xD;
had left, before seeking his own couch.&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
LOST AFFECTION.&#xD;
"Oh! cast not thou&#xD;

That bright gem's purity."-DdIUS. HEMA1~4S.&#xD;

freshed, weak, dizzy and sick. This was the first night's&#xD;
rest she had ever lost in her life. And on looking in the&#xD;
giass~habituallY the first thing the beauty ever did after&#xD;
rising-she was shocked to see what havoc one night's evil&#xD;
passions had made in her appearance. What a fright she&#xD;
had become! How pale her cheeks, how dragged the&#xD;
muscles, how red, dim, and sunken her eyes! And this&#xD;
upon her wedding~day~and wken she had a quarrel to make&#xD;
up with her intended husband, too! When, in fine, every&#xD;
circumstance pressingly demanded that she should appear in&#xD;
the highest beauty. Would Archer Clifton~~-wOuId that&#xD;
fastidious, artistic worshiper of the bcautiful-~feel inclined&#xD;
to a reconciliation with such a spectre as herself, she mentally&#xD;
inquired, as she gazed wonderingly, deploringly, upon her&#xD;
haggard face ~ Carolyn was vain and proud and scornful-&#xD;
so vain and proud and scornful that she did not know-could&#xD;
not imagine that that very haggard face~haggard with sor-&#xD;
row for the estrangement and the separatiOns would be a&#xD;
stronger appeal, make a deeper impression upon the heart of&#xD;
her lover, than all the glory of her beauty had ever done.&#xD;
And thus vanity, pride and scorn punish their subject, not&#xD;
only by depriving her of very much respect and affection she&#xD;
would otherwise have, but by making her insensible of that&#xD;
love and esteem that really does surround her.&#xD;
Carolyn at length rang for her woman. And after some&#xD;
little delay she came in, evidently just aroused up out of her&#xD;

wonder gave way to alarm, and she exclaimed-&#xD;
"My good gracious alive, Miss Carolyn! What's der&#xD;

"Aunt Parky, I am not ill. I have had a bad night's&#xD;

"Aunt IDarky," said Miss Clifton, feeling in no way flat-&#xD;
tered by the parallel, "go and get my bath ready, and have&#xD;
a cup of strong coffee brought the instant I leave it."&#xD;
"Yes, 'honey-an' hadn't de baff's water better have de&#xD;
air tuk 'off o' it, as yom~'se not so strong dis morning' ~"&#xD;
"Yes, yes-what makes you trouble me by questions l&#xD;

"An' so I allus does know, honey-ony when I does my&#xD;

&#xD;
When Miss Clifton had left her warm bath, and had par-&#xD;
taken of the rich strong coffee-~.strong as the essence of&#xD;
coffee, and made rich and thick by being half cream and&#xD;
sugar, and~ brought to her in a tiny porcelain cup, she felt&#xD;
sufficiently refreshed to be ~ible, with the assistance of her&#xD;
woman, to make her morning toilet.&#xD;
When she had finished dressing it was still very early, and&#xD;
two hours remained before breakfast-but she left her room,&#xD;
and met her father, who was an early riser, in the upper&#xD;
hail.&#xD;
lie came forward and kissed her. Then held both her&#xD;
hands, and looked in her face, exclaiming-" What! pale,&#xD;
my child ~ Oh, tnt! tnt! tut! tnt! tnt! That's all&#xD;

"Father! has he come yet V'&#xD;
"No, no-it's quite early yet! He'll be here anon! You&#xD;
should not have risen these two hours !"&#xD;
"Father, IL could not sleep! I could not even lie in&#xD;

"Oh, pooh! pooh! pooh! All folly! All nonsense!&#xD;
Go back and rest."&#xD;
"Father, I cannot! My words to him were so wrong! so&#xD;
bitter! so insulting! I feel them to have been such, and I&#xD;
can never rest until I have told him so !" said Carolyn,&#xD;
dropping her head upon the only bosom to which her&#xD;
haughty heart could bear to confide its sorrow and its re-~&#xD;
pentaiice.&#xD;
"Well, so you weres wrong, very wrong! It will teach&#xD;
you a lesson that will benefit you 'for the fnture.~ And for&#xD;

He then kissed Carolyn and let her go. As she left him,&#xD;
he saw to hi~ surprise Frank Fairfax emerge from his chain-&#xD;
her, with a portmanteau in his hand. Frank immediately set&#xD;
it down, and advancing, said-&#xD;
"Ah, sir! I was just about to seek you, to let you know&#xD;
that, to my infinite regret, I must leave you to-day."&#xD;
"To day ~ You astound me! What is up now ~ . You&#xD;
mustn't go-you shan't!"&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Sir, I have received an order to join my regiment with.&#xD;
out delay!"&#xD;
"Oh-h-h, that's bad! That's bad! Devil fly away with&#xD;
military life! Titat's what was always hiking away Archer&#xD;
at the very time I wanted him ~nost. But no frantic hurry!&#xD;
You needn't go to-day! You mustn't. Why, this is the&#xD;
wedding-day, you rascal !"&#xD;
"I know it, sir! iBut, to my everlasting regret, I must&#xD;
forego the pleasure of being present upon that occasion. My&#xD;
order is a peremptory one, to join my regin~ent instantly."&#xD;
c~ Well, well! To-morrow'll do! To-rnorrow'll do! One&#xD;
day cannot make so much difference !"&#xD;
"My dear sir, I surely need i~ot tell you that soldiers&#xD;
should be 'minute men' in their obedience. Besides, if I&#xD;
do not seize the opportunity of meeting the Staunton stage&#xD;
as it passes through IL- to-night, I shall have to wait&#xD;
three days for the next stage. So, you see-"&#xD;
"Yes, yes; I see! I am always called upon to see some-&#xD;
thing I don't want to see! Ah! herecomes the mint-julep!&#xD;
Did Miss Carolyn mix it V'&#xD;
This was addressed to the colored boy who brought a pint&#xD;
tumbler on a little waiter.&#xD;
"Yez, zur," said the boy.&#xD;
"Do you take julep in the morning, Frank ~ Try this.&#xD;
Another julep for me, Nace !"&#xD;
"No, no, I thank you, sir! I never do. I wish you&#xD;
good-morning till breakfast time," said Frank, taking up his&#xD;
portmanteau, and going down stairs.&#xD;
Frank put his little burden down in the lower hall, and&#xD;
went into the summer saloon, where he was sure, by the pre.&#xD;
cement of the last thirty days, of finding Zuleime at the&#xD;
window, doing her sampler-work. Yes, there she was, in her&#xD;
white muslin and coral, with her jet black hair and damask&#xD;
cheeks! He went and sat down by her, (after saying&#xD;
"Good-morning,") and sat for some minutes in perfect&#xD;
silence, watching Zuleime work the word ~Zoti~, in crimson&#xD;
silk. At length-&#xD;
"Whom do you love best in the world, Zuleime '?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"How can you ask ~ Whom does everybody love best ~-&#xD;

'her nairi sell,' as the Welchman says, of course!" exclaimed&#xD;
the merry maiden.&#xD;
~~1lumph! Well, whom do you love the next best to&#xD;
yourself&#xD;
"Why, let me see," said. the girl, pausing thoughtfully,&#xD;
with her needle poised in her hand; "Ii think, that next to&#xD;
myself, L1ove~Zuleime Clifton best of all the world 1"&#xD;
"I thought so! And I can lay my hand upon my heart,&#xD;
and say, that you don't love Zuleinie Clifton ~ whit better&#xD;
than I do !-no, nor half so well! I'll throw down my gage&#xD;
on that, and fight it out to extremity! Come !-What have&#xD;
you to say to that ~" asked the young man, with all the&#xD;
earnestness in his face and manner that his light words&#xD;
wanted-" say, speak! What do you say to that ~"&#xD;
"Why, that you are as foolish as Zuleime herself, in&#xD;
loving such a little, 0ut~of~the-way baggage, that is neither&#xD;
woman nor child, nor good nor bad, nor any thing else in&#xD;
particular."&#xD;
"Well, at any rate, we both agree in loving and worship-&#xD;
ing Zuleime, however we may differ in our opinion of her-.&#xD;
1, for instance, thinking her a beautiful, joyous, delightful&#xD;
girl. So, it's settled, i~~'t it ~"&#xD;
"What is settled 'i"&#xD;
"Oh, you know, you tease !"&#xD;
"I know the weather is settled, if you mean that !"&#xD;
" Pooh ~&#xD;
"I don't know that the naval trouble with Great Britain&#xD;
is settled, if you mean that!"&#xD;
"Pooh, pooh!"&#xD;
"I know that the marriage dower of thirty thousand dol-&#xD;
lars is settled upon Carolyn, if you mean that !"&#xD;
"Pooh, pooh, pooh !"&#xD;
"Well, I shall not try to guess again, lest you should say,&#xD;
'Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh !'-four times !"&#xD;
"Zuleime !" said the young man, earnestly, "I think,&#xD;
without presumption, I may say that I know your disposition&#xD;
towards me. Zuleime, I wish that we should pass all our&#xD;
lives together, side by side! I would like to open my heart&#xD;
and bid you look into it and read for yourself. I hate to&#xD;
say, 'I love you,' (though if you could look into my heart!)&#xD;

prostituted, so degraded from its high meaning-' I love you'&#xD;
so often means 'I need your wealth,' 'need your family in.&#xD;
fluence,' 'I desire your delightful beauty!' Oh, Zulejine,&#xD;
dearest girl, how then shall I express my true, sincere, earn-&#xD;
est devotion to you ~"&#xD;
"You needn't-I know you like me, Frank," nrnrlnured&#xD;
Zuleime, very low. And then she added, lower still-" IBut&#xD;
I am nothing but a wild school girl, and, seriously, Ii fear it&#xD;
isn't right for me to listen to such words for years to come&#xD;
* yet. And I fear father might not like it, only that he likes&#xD;
you so very well."&#xD;
And Zuleime bent over her sampler, diligently, commenc-&#xD;
ing the next word, 1$o~je, in azure silk.&#xD;
"I know it, Zuleime! Dear, candid girl, I know it all-.-&#xD;
all the seeming error! But, Zuleime, I am going away to-&#xD;
* day," (she looked up in surprise,) "and I may be gone for&#xD;
several years. When I come back I shall certainly return&#xD;
a captain, if not probably a major, or possibly a colonel.&#xD;
Before I go, I wish to have a fair understanding with your-&#xD;
self and your father, so that I may go away with some feel-&#xD;
ing of security. I want you both to promise that when I&#xD;
return you will give me your hand."&#xD;
"You may speak to father, Frank. But I tell you frankly&#xD;
now, what I wish you had heard before. It is this :-that I&#xD;
have been promised to my grim cousin, Major Cabell, ever&#xD;
since I can remember anything. And till you came, I have&#xD;
always, whenever 1 have anticipated the future at all, looked&#xD;
forward to being his hum-drum wife, and living inagrini&#xD;
three-story red brick, in a row, and opposite another row of&#xD;
stiff, prison-like red brick houses, each one of which, taken&#xD;
singly, is more dreary than all the rest. I didn't like the&#xD;
prospect, Frank; but I thought it was my fate, and the best&#xD;
father could do for me, and so I thought of no other possi-&#xD;
bility but the grim red brick house in the ~iity and Major&#xD;
Cabell. Besides, father is so good a father, and so fond and&#xD;
indulgent, that it seemed too wicked to think of disappoint-&#xD;
ing his gentle wishes, that never take the form of commands.&#xD;
And so, Frank, although whenever I would think of the&#xD;
grim brick house, with tall dark chambers, and the narrow,&#xD;
stony, distracting street before it, and Major Cabell, my&#xD;
heart would sink very heavy, and I would think, young as I&#xD;

was, that there was scarcely any, hope for me at all-yet, I&#xD;
would recollect my dear good father wished it, and I would&#xD;
cluck up my spirits and feel blithe ,as a bird again. It was&#xD;
all understood at the school where I am getting finished, as&#xD;
they call it. And father left word that Major Cabell should&#xD;
be admitted to visit me. So when I am there he comes to&#xD;
~jgjt me frequently, and takes me out riding, or driving, and&#xD;
to concerts. And the girls'whisper together, and say that I&#xD;
am engaged&#xD;
~ Pardon me, Zuleime! Par-&#xD;
don me, dear girl! But, I am giddy~indeed, I am ill!&#xD;
Illave you yourself promised to marry him V'&#xD;
"No, surely not; and that is the reason why I consider&#xD;
myself in some sort free-but of my duty to my good father.&#xD;
No, he has never even asked me. lie considers my father's&#xD;
promise quite sufficient, and our marriage quite a matter of&#xD;
course. And so I used to consider it, too. These things&#xD;
are often done, Frank. These betrothals, I mean. Any&#xD;
one might suppose the custom 0~50lete~~having died in the&#xD;
dark ages. It is not. It prevails here to a considerable ex-&#xD;
tent. It is done to keep family property together, or family&#xD;
interest closely cemented. And, Frank, he has never courted&#xD;
me yet. You see he considers me a child 5till. And so I&#xD;
am, compared to him, in years. And so I should be, in all&#xD;
things, a child, but that the shadow of that grim brick house&#xD;
is always falling on my heart !"&#xD;
"And yet, with all this, you ar~ a very, very merry&#xD;
maiden ~'&#xD;
"Yes, so I am. I try to be!. I keep a din up in my&#xD;
head to prevent me hearing what my heart wants to say.&#xD;
Goodness! I can do nothing for the poor thing, you know,&#xD;
andwhat's the use of stopping to listen to its cry ~-that&#xD;
would only encourage it to complain the more. Don't look&#xD;
so sorry, Frank! It is not all effort! It could not be, you&#xD;
know. I'm jiaturally of a glad, elastic temper; and but for&#xD;
this drawback, Heaven knows what I should be! the wildest,&#xD;
maddest, most liarem-scarem, most heels~over-head, skip-&#xD;
over-the-moon madcap that ever turned a quiet home topsy-&#xD;
turvy, and drove a quiet family to distraction! The Bible&#xD;
says,-' God loveth whom lie ehasteneth, and scourgeth&#xD;

(I do think, sometimes, young and volatile as I am,) 'I think&#xD;
that every one whom God redeems has some sorrow, and that&#xD;
that sorrow is always the~precise one fitted to cure their be-&#xD;
setting sin! As the proud are still kept down by poverty&#xD;
and oppression, the vain lose their charms, or the power of&#xD;
enhancing them, etc., etc., etc., among all the erring wh9nu&#xD;
God designs to set right. And I, who am naturally so wild&#xD;

"Zuleime, does this man love you ?"&#xD;
"Frank, if I say he does not hate me, it is the extent of&#xD;
all favorable things I can say about the state of his mind&#xD;
towards me. No, he does not love me. Ibis entirely a be-&#xD;
trothal of convenience. Sometimes I look forward to my&#xD;
future life in that great unknown city, which I should dislike&#xD;
under any circumstances, and especially to pass my whole&#xD;
life in, with one I do not like, and who does not like me, and&#xD;
I wonder how I shall contrive to exist,-I, who love to be&#xD;
in the country, on this dear old homestead, with my fond old&#xD;
father and my tender old nurse, and the colored folks who&#xD;
love me so well,-and where I have so many occupations,..-.&#xD;
and, oh, my soul and body! I think how shall I ever put&#xD;
life through in that packed up city! Sometimes I think-.&#xD;
for I must have something to occupy my whole soul with-..&#xD;
that I will be very gay and worldly, and dress, and visit, and&#xD;
give balls, and go to 1411s, and theatres; but then again I&#xD;
reflect that it would be wicked to spend. all one's time and&#xD;
attention upon such things. And then I think I shall try to&#xD;
grow serious enough to join a* church, and that I will be a&#xD;
leading member, and a Sunday School teacher, and a patron-&#xD;
ess of the Bible Society, and of the Missionary Society, and&#xD;
a getter-up of new kinds 'of benevolent associations, and&#xD;
Porcas circles, and be a Committee woman, and a distributor&#xD;
of tracts, and a collector of subscriptions, etc. One must&#xD;
do something to fill up the long, long days; one must live&#xD;
somehow, and, upon the whole, I thought this latter plan&#xD;
might do, as it would occupy me entirely, and is not so&#xD;
wicked as the other."&#xD;
"Ab, I don't know that, Zuleime! But, my dearest girl,&#xD;

marry him. You have never promised to do so. It is a&#xD;
mere betrothal of convenience, made by the parents of both&#xD;
for the purpose of keeping family property together, and&#xD;
j,01nenting family interests. Oh, it is all wrong! And there&#xD;
is thingg in it! IL will speak to your father. I will enter&#xD;
the 'lists with this Major Cabell, as a competitor for your&#xD;

"Yes," murmured Zuleime, beginning to~ embroider the&#xD;
last word of the frio,~..ft1itIbin sunbeam silk. No time&#xD;
was to be lost. Itie raised her hand to his lips, and darted&#xD;
out upon the lawn to meet old Mr. Clifton, whom he saw ap-&#xD;
proaching the house.&#xD;
"My dear sir !" exclaimed Mr. Fairfax, rather excitedly,&#xD;
"I have something of the utmost importance to say to you!&#xD;
Will you take a turn .with me&#xD;
"My dear sir !" repeated the old gentleman~ smiling,&#xD;
"breakfast is ready! Let's go on to the house !"&#xD;
"But my dear sir! my business .i~ urgent !"&#xD;
"My very dear ~sir! the coffee is getting cold !" said the&#xD;
old man, laughing at Frank's excitement.&#xD;

"Say on then, my dear boy! say on !" exclaimed the&#xD;
benevolent old gentleman. But Frank, now that he had got&#xD;
leave to speak, was struck dumb. He thought it was per-&#xD;
fectly easy and simple to ask for Zuleime, but now the re-&#xD;
quest, like Macbeth's amen, stuck in his throat. "Come,"&#xD;
said the old gentleman~ running his fat arm through Frank's&#xD;

"No, sir," said Frank, glad to recover the use of his&#xD;

"Mr. Clifton, I love your daughter Zuleime. And I have&#xD;
come to beg your sanction to our engagement !" As the old&#xD;
man only said, "Whew-w-w-w !" Frank continued.~....c~ You&#xD;
know my rank in the army, and my prospect of promotion.&#xD;
You are acquainted with my family, and are aware of their&#xD;
interest and influence in the country. Allow me farther to&#xD;
add, that my own private. fortune amounts to fifty thousand&#xD;

"Stay, stay--my dear fellow, stay !" interrupted the old&#xD;
man, with a troubled look. "This is all nonsense, now!&#xD;
Zuleime is a child.' And you have not known her more than&#xD;
six weeks. Love Zuleime! Pooh, pooh! You young men&#xD;

Pooh, pooh! Now, Frank, my boy, come! let's hear no&#xD;

and Heaven forefend, a little Platonically smitten with all&#xD;
their wives, too! Come, I know you! Nonsense! Let's&#xD;

"Mr. Clifton, I am no trifler in matters of the affections.&#xD;

or accepted hiss suit, "I have never, in my 'whole life, been&#xD;

might judge, from what I told you! And when I tell you&#xD;

that I shall love her to the last hour of my life !"&#xD;
"Bah! bah! It's all tom..foolerI, I tell you! You get&#xD;

you didn't! But it is such love as will not outlast your&#xD;

"Tah! tah' tah 1-you'll fall desperately in love with the&#xD;

"Oh, God !" groaned the young man, bitterly, dropping&#xD;
his face into his hands. "There is no, way of making a&#xD;

force of the emotion that agitated, the old man, shaking his&#xD;
huge form, and choking up his utterance.&#xD;
Mr. Fairfax looked at .him with mingled astonishment,&#xD;
wonder and compassion.&#xD;
"Boy~boyyou haven't entrapped my der~r child's&#xD;

excess of feeling.&#xD;

proudlY and inouruftilly. "I learned to love her, and I&#xD;
Won her love without designing to do either !"&#xD;
"Lost! Lost!" cried Mr. Clifton, dropping his head upon&#xD;
his bosom. lie walked on in silence so responding, that&#xD;
Fairfax could not bring himself to intrude upon it. They&#xD;
went on until they suddenly met .Major Cabell himself coming&#xD;
down the hill, apparently from llardbargain.&#xD;
The 1~Iajor was walking slowly, with his head do~n, and&#xD;
twirling around his finger a topaz necklace. As soon as he&#xD;
perceived Messrs. Clifton and Fairfax, his forehead flushed,&#xD;
and he hastily crammed the necklace into his vest pocket.&#xD;
Fiank thought the whole thing strange, but, hut stranger&#xD;
still was the eonduetthe metamorphosisthe transfigura-&#xD;
tion of Mr. Clifton, who, upon observing the Major, instantly&#xD;
put a violent constraint upon himself, and became the broad-&#xD;
faced, rosy, smiling, blue-eyed, debonair old gentleman, so&#xD;
lavish in the display of his fine teeth, and hearty, cordial&#xD;
words and smiles. Frank was provoked that their conversa&#xD;
tion was so completely arrested.&#xD;
"Ah, good morning," said Mr. Clifton, addressing the&#xD;
Nlajor. "B9en tQ J~ardbargain this morning so early ~ How&#xD;
are all the folks up there ~ See, Archer ~ Why didn't he&#xD;
walk with you ~ Eh ~ Expected him !"&#xD;
"Ii have not been to ~ardbargain, sir," replied the Major,&#xD;
rather morosely.&#xD;
"Been out taking a morning stroll then, eh I Fine appe-&#xD;
tite for breakfast, no doubt. And it is waiting for us, too.&#xD;
Come, Frank, let's turn about."&#xD;
They did so. Frank now noticed for the first time that&#xD;
the manner of the old gentleman was 0onciliating, while that&#xD;
of the Major was surly.&#xD;
They soon reached the house, and the breakfast-room,&#xD;
where the ladies were awaiting their arrival.&#xD;
As they entered, the countenance of Carolyn Clifton was&#xD;
flushed and~eager. But when they'had all got in, and were&#xD;
seated at the table, the color died out of her face, leaving&#xD;
her pale as marble. She merely trifled with her breakfast,&#xD;
pretending to eat, but no morsel passed .her lips. When&#xD;
breakfast was over, and the company dispersed about the&#xD;

room, Carolyn almost reeled past her father in going out, and&#xD;
muttered with pale lips-" Father! Not come yet ?"&#xD;
"Never mind! Never mind, my dear! II will ride up t~&#xD;
Hardbargain and fetch him."&#xD;
"Not for the universe, father! if he never comes !" re.&#xD;
plied the determined girl, plucking up her spirit, and sweep.&#xD;
nig proudly past and going into the piazza, where she sat,&#xD;
hy-the-bye, with her eyes strained up the mountain-path by&#xD;
which he ought to come.&#xD;
Frank got no opportunity of speaking alone with Zuleinie.&#xD;
Old Mr. Clifton met him, however, when he came in from&#xD;
looking after his horse, and said, kindly patting him on the&#xD;
shoulder-&#xD;
"Indeed, my dear boy, I don't see the least necessity for&#xD;
your leaving us until after dinner. The stage coach doesn't&#xD;
pass through I till eight o'clock at night, and five'or&#xD;
six hours is ample time in which to reach ther~ !"&#xD;
"Yes, sir! I grant it, but I have to go thi&amp;amp; morning to&#xD;
ilardbargamn to take leave of Mrs. Clifton, and of 'my friend&#xD;
Archer, if, indeed, the latter is not ordered on the same duty&#xD;
as myself, which, upon Miss Clifton's account, I am inclined:&#xD;
to fear !"&#xD;
"Oh! Are you going to ride to Hardbargain ~ Then,&#xD;
perhaps, you will be pleased to learn that Zuleime is going&#xD;
there this morning, also, to assist Mrs. Clifton in putting the&#xD;
last finishing touches to her dress for this evening. And you&#xD;
can escort her!" said Georgia, smoothly gliding between them,&#xD;
and laying her head and hand with child-like freedom and&#xD;
affection upon the old man's shoulder.&#xD;
"Oh! I shall be very happy !" said Frank, "really happy&#xD;
-nay, overjoyed, intoxicated, with the prospect of an unin-&#xD;
terrupted, farewell l~te-~-t~te with Zuleime."&#xD;
Old Mr. Clifton looked rather disappointed,, but he was&#xD;
not of a very combative disposition....-especially had he no in-&#xD;
clination to contradict Georgia. Besides, he at once reflected&#xD;
that there was really no danger. They couldn't be married&#xD;
in the neighborhood,. because they could get no license, and&#xD;
no clergyman dare marry them without one. And it was not&#xD;
probable, or even possible, that Frank would elope with his&#xD;
daughter on the very eve of joining his regiment for a distant&#xD;
and dangerous service. In truth, he felt it was folly to&#xD;
&#xD;
129&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
cherish a misgiving. And yet he had misgivings, nor could&#xD;
he banish them-the utmost* extent of his self-control was-&#xD;
not to act upon them-not to forbid their riding together.&#xD;
While Zuleime was putting on her hat and riding habit,&#xD;
Frank got the ear of the old gentleman once more, and for&#xD;
the last time. The old man had sunk into his broad-&#xD;
bottomed flag chair in the hall, with his thick gold-headed&#xD;
~tjck between his knees, and his two hands and his chin rest~-'&#xD;
ing upon it, when Frank stood before him with folded arms&#xD;
and head dropped upon his breast, and said-&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton~~Once more, and for the last time, I ask you,&#xD;
and I implore you to answer me candidly. Is there any pos-&#xD;
sibility that, under any change of circumstances, at any future&#xD;
time, I may hope for your consent to my union with Zn-&#xD;
leime V'&#xD;
The earnestness, deepening almost into solemnity, of the&#xD;
young man's manner and words, impressed Mr. Clifton very&#xD;
deeply, but he replied-" Mr. Fairfax, it is best to speak the&#xD;
plain,.h~rsh, cutting truth, though that truth is the axe laid&#xD;
to the root of all your hopes of Zuleime. No. Yet I regret&#xD;
~. this, Frank! You do not know how much! But you must&#xD;
forget her! I hope you will soon do so! I know you must!"&#xD;
Frank shook his head in despairing negation. And farther&#xD;
colloquy was arrested by the coming down of Zuleime equip-&#xD;
ped for her ride.&#xD;
"Come here, my daughter! Now you must be sure to be&#xD;
back by dinner tim~, do you hear 'P'&#xD;
"Certainly, sir!"&#xD;
"Promise me."&#xD;
"Of course I do."&#xD;
"Upon your honor!" said the old man, seriously.&#xD;
"Upon my honor, sir, I will return by dinner time! But&#xD;
what makes you so emphatic about it, dear father V'&#xD;
"A notion of mine, my child! but I have your promise !"&#xD;
"Of course you have, sir !" said Zuleime, drawing on her&#xD;
gloves.&#xD;
Mr. Fairfax was taking leave of Mrs. Clifton. Presently&#xD;
he turned to bid adieu to Mr. Clifton.&#xD;
The old gentleman shook his hand warmly, wishing him&#xD;
all the success he desired, and affecting to laugh and jest,&#xD;
while he exacted a like promise ffom Fairfax, namely, that&#xD;

130             THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
- he should take his girl to Hardbargain, and leave her There&#xD;
to return by dinner time.&#xD;
Frank gave his word very cheerfully. The young couple&#xD;
then mounted, and rode away. The old man watched them&#xD;
from the piazza in sorrowful love, murmuring-&#xD;
"~'od bless them. I wish they could be married. Poor&#xD;
things. If they do love each other so much, or if they think&#xD;
they do, which is quite as bad while it lasts-.why, it is but&#xD;
kind to let them have this last little parting comfort of a ride&#xD;
together! And it was well, too-" chuckled the old gentle-&#xD;
man~-" to tie them up with promises, so that they can't rim&#xD;
away, which they might else be tempted to do in their part-&#xD;
ing hour. But they will neither of them ever break their&#xD;
word, and I shall have her hack safe by dinner time. For&#xD;
it is utterly impossible for thefri to get married without a&#xD;
license, and it is quite 'impracticable to get a license this side&#xD;
of L ,or to ride to L between this and noon,&#xD;
much less to ride thither and return here in time for dinner!.&#xD;
Ah! I have them there! And yet, I am sorry for them, too!&#xD;
Poor things !"&#xD;
All this time Carolyn Clifton had sat like one dead, only&#xD;
with her eyes strained up the mountain bridal-path.&#xD;
In the meantime, Frank and. ~uleime pursued their ride.&#xD;
As soon as they were out of sight and hearing of a band of&#xD;
field laborers, employed in cutting grass, and had entered the&#xD;
shady mountain path, Frank said- -&#xD;
"Well, Zuleime, my dearest girl, I spoke to your father-"&#xD;
-" And his answer--I almost dread to hear it-yet I&#xD;
know what it was, too."&#xD;
Frank nodded his head, and they rode on in silence for&#xD;
some minutes, 'broken at last by Frank, who suddenly ex-&#xD;
claimed-&#xD;
"Zuleime! you bear this so well !"&#xD;
"Frank, you know this is no new thing to me; I have&#xD;
known it, and been prepared for it all along!" replied the&#xD;
girl, with a look of. resignation.&#xD;
"Oh, Zuleime! is there no way to prevent it 'f"&#xD;
"None that I know of, Frank !"&#xD;
"Zuleime! 'P was in every way his equal-.-~why, when that&#xD;
is the case, and when I was supported by your voice, too-&#xD;
why was I rejected '?"&#xD;
&#xD;
4',&#xD;
THE CU1~SE OF CLIFTON.           131&#xD;
&#xD;
The maiden shook her head.&#xD;
"Zuleime, when is this hideous marriage expected to como~&#xD;
off-do you knowP'&#xD;
"Whenever Major Cabell chooses to demand my hand,&#xD;
I believe !"&#xD;
"Really! Upon my word He is a personage of tre-&#xD;
mendous importance! Whenever HE chooses to demand your&#xD;
hand!! Zuleime! that is passing strange! This a~air&#xD;
seems then to rest entirely with Major Cabell! ! !"&#xD;
"Yes, it does entirely."&#xD;
"Bless his Majesty. Zuleime, what hold has that man on&#xD;
your father ?"&#xD;
Zuleime shook her black ringlets mournfully, but did not&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"Do you know, my dear girl, that I am impressed with&#xD;
the idea that your father does not at heart wish to give you&#xD;
to Major Cabell, but rather yields to a strange power the&#xD;
man holds over him ~"&#xD;
"At times I have thought so, 'too. But then my dear&#xD;
father at other times really seenis so set upon the marriage,&#xD;
that the thought has been driven out of my head again! I&#xD;
do not know what to think! But what I do know is, that II&#xD;
will never willingly do anything to give my dear father&#xD;
pain!"&#xD;
"My dearest girl, do you know that I believe, from my&#xD;
soul, that your marriage with Major Cabell will give your&#xD;
father more pain than any other circumstance could s?"&#xD;
The young girl looked up in surprise.&#xD;
"Zuleime! he told me to-day, that though he had promis-&#xD;
ed you to Major Cabell, he would rather die than see you un-&#xD;
happy,, or stand in the way of your perfect happiness !"&#xD;
"My dear father! My dear, gentle father! My fond,&#xD;
old father !" exclaimed Zulei~ne, with the bright tears rolling&#xD;
on her damask cheeks, like dew on the red rose. "My kind,&#xD;
generous father! He shall never know that I am unhappy!&#xD;
And neither shall I be unhappy when pleasing him !"&#xD;
"My dear, excellent girl! listen to me! You shall not&#xD;
be unhappy any way! Do you suppose, Zuleime, that' I could&#xD;
ride by your side so cheerfully, if I thought you were going&#xD;
to marry that man, on whom your father no more wishes to&#xD;
bestow you, than he wishes to send you to perdition ~ Listen,&#xD;

132             2~~E CURSE OF CLIFT&amp;amp;K.&#xD;
my darling girl! When your father told me what I have&#xD;
repeated to you, he went on to say, that for certain family&#xD;
reasons, it was incumbent on him to fulfill his promise, and to&#xD;
bestow your hand upon Major Cabell, unless some insurmount..&#xD;
able obstacle should interpose to arrest the union! Zuleitne!&#xD;
a flood of light broke on me then I and I felt and knew that&#xD;
the old man would yield his darling daughter to th~ myste..&#xD;
rious power exercised over him by Major (Yabell, rather than&#xD;
bestow her with esteem and affection! Zuleime! without&#xD;
vanity, I think that he loves me better, and would prefer me&#xD;
for a son-in-law, if he were free to choose. I think, indeed&#xD;
I do, that he would hail with secret joy "an in~urmountable&#xD;
obstacle," which would prevent the marriage, and not im-&#xD;
plicate him in any manner. I think that was what he meant&#xD;
when he said what he did. Still, I am convinced that the&#xD;
words slipped from him unintentionally. I am certain he&#xD;
did not mean to give me the hint, which nevertheless, I take,&#xD;
,for he is a man of' strict honor, I knQw, and would never&#xD;
tamper -with the spirit of a promise any more than he would&#xD;
break' the words I"&#xD;
"Oh! no, he never would, indeed !"&#xD;
"'-And again, my dearest girl, when I asked him just be..&#xD;
fore we came away, whether, at any future time, under any&#xD;
possible contingency, I might hope to obtain his consent to&#xD;
our union, he assured me that I might not, and earnestly en-&#xD;
-treated me to forget you! That further convinced me that&#xD;
he bad no design in giving me the hint upon which I am&#xD;
about to aet.-do you hear me, dearest Zuleime ?"&#xD;
Zuleime did not, or at least did not appear to. -&#xD;
"-Zuleime, my darling, m~y love," said Frank, dismount-&#xD;
ing in the path, and lifting her from her saddle, "I am about&#xD;
to raise 'an insurmountable obstacle' to your marriage with&#xD;
the Major !"&#xD;
~uleime turned -deadly pale with surprise and terror, and&#xD;
;glanced wildly around, while she fell upon his arm and seemed&#xD;
about to' faint.&#xD;
"' Why, Zuleime! Come, come. What is the matter?&#xD;
Don't be afraid! What, afraid of me, of Frank, your play-&#xD;
mate? Why, look up in my face and see! Come, lift up&#xD;
-your head! I want to talk to you! There! there! Why,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE OUflSE OF CLIFTON.           183&#xD;
what arc you afraid of~ I will take no step without your&#xD;
consent, sweet Zuleime !"&#xD;
The infinite tenderness of his words, tones and manner,&#xD;
reassured the frightened girl, and she raised her face, now&#xD;
suffused with blushes. He supported her with his arm&#xD;
around her waist, while he pointed down into a narrow glen&#xD;
to the right, and said-&#xD;
There! Look there, Zuleime. Do you see that little&#xD;
stone house-.---there in the bottom of the glen-there by the&#xD;
spring-but so much like the rocks, near it, and so deep in&#xD;
the shade, as hardly to be distinguishable! IDe you see it V'&#xD;
"Yes," breathed the maiden, very low:&#xD;
"Do you know who lives there 3"&#xD;
~ No."&#xD;
"A good old man! A saintly old man! A poor Baptist&#xD;
missionary preacher, who lives in that hut quite alone, and&#xD;
preaches there every Sunday to an humble congregation,&#xD;
composed of poor mountaineers and negroes. 1911e has d&amp;amp;.&#xD;
voted his life to labor among the mountaifl' people, and has&#xD;
done wonders in reforming them! Is it possible that you,&#xD;
living in the neighborhood, knew nothing of-him!"&#xD;
"Oh, yes! I have heard a great deal about Mr. Saunders,&#xD;
only I did not know where exactly his hat was. There are&#xD;
so many of them, you know !" said the girl,' somewhat re-&#xD;
covered, and much interested.&#xD;
"My dearest Zuleime! we will go down to that hut! 'I&#xD;
see by the smoke, that so gracefully curls,' that the old man&#xD;
is at home. We will tell him the whole story, as far as we&#xD;
know it, and get him to raise that required insurmountable&#xD;
obstacle ~&#xD;
"Oh! Frank!" exclaimed Zuleime, shocked, delighted,&#xD;
terrified, overjoyed.&#xD;
"But, my dearest Zuleime! my dearest love! I have&#xD;
recorded an oath in Heaven, to save you 'from that marriage&#xD;
with Cabell! And I will never leave you until you are my&#xD;
wife. If you refuse NOW, I will throw up my commission in&#xD;
the army, and live there in that hut with the old parson,&#xD;
until you do consent !"&#xD;
~C But, my father, Frank! My dear father!"&#xD;
"II~earest girl, he will be glad !" Here Frank went over&#xD;
the whole story again, and added-" And Zuleime, have you&#xD;

no love, no pity left from your father to bestow upon the&#xD;
poor soldier who loves you so, and who is going out to the&#xD;
Indian frontier, where he may lose his scalp, or be burned&#xD;
alive, or eaten raw within a month by the red-skins ~ Will&#xD;
you refuse his last prayer?" ete,, etc., etc. Over and over&#xD;
am, fervently, earnestly, imploringly, despairingly he re~&#xD;
pleated the argument and the prayer, while he held the maiden&#xD;
" half willing, Ealf~ afraid." "8he who hesitates is lost," it&#xD;
iB said.&#xD;
Zuleime ;hesitated a long time, and, consequently, was lost&#xD;
to all eternity. What could she oppose, indeed, to what&#xD;
seemed so right and, reasonable? With a deep sigh she&#xD;
yielded at last. There was no path that way down into the&#xD;
glen, and .the descent was deep and precipitous, and over-&#xD;
grown with stunted cedar, pine and thorn bu~hes. So,&#xD;
Romeo and Juliet began to chamber down, by foot-holds of&#xD;
jagged rooks, and fist-holds of thorn hushes, to the great&#xD;
risk of wounded hands and torn pants and petticoats. And&#xD;
so it was in rather a disordered state of attire, as well as in&#xD;
~an e~oited state of mind, that they at last arrived before the&#xD;
door of Father Lawrence's cell, and rapped. While they&#xD;
~waited for the old man to appear, Frank, very much to the&#xD;
surprise of ~uleiine, drew from his vest pocket a license-a&#xD;
regular. bouz fide license, signed by the clerk of R&#xD;
county, and sealed with the county seal. Resting his foot&#xD;
~upon the door-step, he took off his hat, turned it down on his&#xD;
knee, laid the license upon its top, and drawing from his&#xD;
other pocket a ~travelling pen and ink case, proceeded to&#xD;
write the names of Erancis RuI~land Fairfax and Zulejine&#xD;
]2~ovilliers Clifton in the blank spaces.&#xD;
"You lool~Isurprised, my dearest girl," said he, as he re-&#xD;
turi~ed the pen and ink case to his pocket. "You wonder&#xD;
hoW I came L~y this license? I will tell you. I have it by&#xD;
a stroke of the rarest good fortune. You know, being&#xD;
groemsinan, I was entrusted with the duty of riding to&#xD;
1~-~-----~--, and procuring the marriagee license for Archer and&#xD;
your sister. W~dl! when I arrived at the clerk's office, by&#xD;
the strangest caprice of memory, I entirely forgot Miss&#xD;
Clifton's middle name, so I got the clerk to give me one&#xD;
license filled out with the names of Carolyn Clif~on and&#xD;
4rohei~ Clifton, and then knowing how extremely punctilious&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTOif.&#xD;
&#xD;
135&#xD;
&#xD;
you all' are here, in this' county, I procured another license&#xD;
regularly signed and sealed, but leaving blank spaces for the&#xD;
proper names of the parties! There, darling! that is the&#xD;
wanner in which I came 1~y it! Now, this blank one I fill&#xD;
up with our names, which I really think look quite as pretty&#xD;
as the others would! As for Clifton and your sister, if they&#xD;
want a license, they will have to put up with the first, which I&#xD;
will hand to Archer as soon as we get to flardbargain. Bless&#xD;
my soul! what has become of that old man?" he exclaimed~&#xD;
rapping loudly, then trying the door and. pushing it open.&#xD;
The house was empty. Frank looked dismally disappointed,&#xD;
but Zuleime plucked him by the sleeve, and whispered, hur-&#xD;
riedly-&#xD;
"Here he comes-behind you !'~&#xD;
And he turned to see the old preacher coming from the&#xD;
spring, bending under the light weight of a small pail of&#xD;
water. Frank immediately went to him, greeted him respect-&#xD;
fully, and took from his hand the pail, and carrying it,&#xD;
walked by ~is side, till they reached the house. Lieutenant&#xD;
Fairfax then introduced himself by name and station, and&#xD;
presented *IMIiss Zuleinie Clifton. The old man bowed and&#xD;
offered his hand, with a courtly grace, in strange contrast to&#xD;
his rude garb and rough habitation. He invited them to&#xD;
come in an~ sit d0wn. And when they ~had entered, and&#xD;
Zuleime was seated, Frank took the old man aside, commu-&#xD;
nicated the object of their call, and produced his license.&#xD;
The old man glanced from the earnest countenance of Frank&#xD;
to the blushing, downcast face of Zuleime, shook his bald&#xD;
head, and looked very grave.&#xD;
Frank drew him off to the farthest corner of the little hut,&#xD;
made him sit down on the foot of his bed, seated himself by&#xD;
his side, and in a fervid, earnest,, eloquent manner, told him&#xD;
their little story.&#xD;
Many times the old man shook his thin, gray locks. They&#xD;
were not good things-these secret marriages-they never&#xD;
prospered. Marriage should be open as day-with the&#xD;
blessing of God-with the blessing of parents-with the&#xD;
sympathy of friends-with the good wishes of acquaintances&#xD;
to hallow and prosper the union~&#xD;
"Oh!" said Frank, but this was an extraordinary occa-&#xD;

riage, but circumstances compelled him to withhold his open&#xD;
consent-he himself, (Frank,) was about to depart on a long&#xD;
journey, and merely wished to secure his bride against a&#xD;
forced marriage of convenience during his absence. In short,&#xD;
Frank recommended the argument, and told it all over from&#xD;
beginning to end.&#xD;
Still the old man shook his bald head and demurred~&#xD;
Frank began the story over again, recited the whole of it,&#xD;
with many additions and improvements.&#xD;
To no purpose.-...the old man was obdurate. Frank, then,&#xD;
half angrily, arose and said-&#xD;
"Come Zuleime! We must go on to the frontier together,&#xD;
and find somebody to marry us on the route, and let Mr.&#xD;
Saunders here be responsible for all trouble that may ~ensue,&#xD;
since with the license before him, he refuses to unite us."&#xD;
At this, Zuleime burst into tears and wept heartily.&#xD;
The old preacher dropped his head upon his breast in trou-&#xD;
bled thought for some moments, and, whetherr the arguments&#xD;
of Frank had after all produced some effect, or whether he&#xD;
feared to encounter the responsibility of sending this wild&#xD;
young couple on their way unman ."' or whether he was&#xD;
moved to pity by the tears of Zulcime, or whether, as is&#xD;
more probable, all these considerations actuated him, I know&#xD;
not; but ho slowly rose to his feet, uncovered his head, and&#xD;
lifted up his eyes in silent prayer awhile, then bade the&#xD;
young pair stand up, for that he would marry them.&#xD;
Frank clasped the hand of Zuleinie, and led her forward.&#xD;
And in less than fifteen minutes more, by the magic of a few&#xD;
words, the youth and maiden were man and wife. And whiP&#xD;
Mrs. Fairfax, with trembling white fingers, was tying her&#xD;
hat, Mr. Fairfimx would have emptied the whole contents of&#xD;
his purse in the minister's. hands,~-but, though that moneys&#xD;
might have supplied the poor old preached~ with many neces-&#xD;
saries for which he really suffered, and made him very com-&#xD;
fortable for a long time, yet he turned away his head, and&#xD;
put it away from him, saying-&#xD;
"No, young man, I cannot take your gold; I may have&#xD;
erred in what J have done, but I did not do it for money."&#xD;
"But you always take a fee, do you not i",&#xD;
"From others I do-not 'from you. It would not be&#xD;
blessed."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
The boyish brow of Frank clouded and darkened, but it&#xD;
cleared again instantly as he turned towards his bride.&#xD;
They were about to bid the old minister adieu, when be&#xD;
took a hand of each, and joining them again, held them in&#xD;
his own, while he said-&#xD;
"Children, if this thoughtless act bring you into much&#xD;
trouble, in the long, weary years of trial and suffering that&#xD;
may result from it, reproach me for my share in the rash&#xD;
deed as much as you please, but,-" be paused and looked&#xD;
solemnly from one to the other,-" never, as you value love,&#xD;
and fidelity, and peaCe,-never~ as you value the favor of&#xD;
heaven, never reproach each other with it! So may God&#xD;
forgive, and bless, and prosper you! Good-bye !"&#xD;
The young bride and groom had bowed their heads during&#xD;
this benediction, and at its close responded with a silent,&#xD;
he~xtf'elt amen. They then left the cabin.&#xD;
If the minister of God grievously erred in performing this&#xD;
secret marriage. ceren~ny, he was soon called to account for&#xD;
it; the old man died that night.&#xD;
As Mr. and Mrs. Fairfamr left the cabin, they perceived&#xD;
Kate Kavanagh, on her little rough-coated mountain pony,&#xD;
coming straight down into the glen-her sure-footed little&#xD;
animal treading with perfect security the precipitous descent&#xD;
down which they had been 'obliged to clamber. Kate was&#xD;
looking very pale and care-worn, so that her ponderous&#xD;
abutting forehead, in its pallor, reminded Frank of a bare-&#xD;
bleached cliff. And, indeed, he thought that Kate's face&#xD;
looked more like that of an anxious politician, with the af-&#xD;
fairs of a nation on his shoulders, than of a grieved girl.&#xD;
But this was the fault of her marked features. But little&#xD;
time or thought had Mr. Fairfax to bestow upon the moun-&#xD;
tain-girl; so as soon as he caught sight of her, he turned in&#xD;
'another direction, to avoid being recognized, saying-&#xD;
"By all that's fatal, my dearest love, we were near being&#xD;
detected! And by all that's fortunate, we have escaped!&#xD;
Come, this way, we will take a stroll down the glen and&#xD;
into the forest for a little while, until this girl is clear of the&#xD;
way.~~&#xD;
"Oh, but it will delay us so much, I shall not have time&#xD;
to go to Rardbargain, ~ud assist Aunt Clifton, and get back&#xD;
home to dinner, as I promised 1',&#xD;

".]Jfy dear!" said Frank, reproachfully, "do you grudge&#xD;
me these last few hours of your society, when we are about&#xD;
to be separated so far and so long ~ Besides, you know you&#xD;
are my own dear wife now. Will you refuse ~"&#xD;
"No, no, I cannot! But, oh, let me return~ to father...&#xD;
my dear, fond, confiding father,-...-as soon as - I promised!&#xD;
Lct me keep the word of promise to his ear, if I have broken&#xD;
it to his hope!" cried Zuleime, bursting into a passion of&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
Safe tears, and unobserved but by him who kissed them&#xD;
away, for already they had entered the thicket, and were&#xD;
veiled from the sight of Kate Kavanagh, who now dis..&#xD;
mounted before the door of the hut, and taking from the&#xD;
horns of the saddle a basket and a bundle, entered the poor&#xD;
preacher's humble habitation. We will turn from the erring&#xD;
pair and enter with her. None but God knew how much dis.&#xD;
interested good the poor mountain..girl did in this world.&#xD;
Even the minister, who loved and req~ected her, knew little&#xD;
beyond the good she did for him. lie knew that she knit&#xD;
flew stockings and darned old ones for him-that she took&#xD;
his scanty clothing every week, and mended, and washed,&#xD;
and ironed it for him-and that when she brought it back,&#xD;
she would always bring him butter, cream and cheese of her&#xD;
own making, and a fresh loaf of rising bread of her own&#xD;
baking, and often some little rural luxury besides, as a jar&#xD;
of honey or a piece of venison. And that she would stay&#xD;
and clean up his house before she left, lie knew that she&#xD;
was his good spirit.&#xD;
As Kate entered the room, the old man came and met her,&#xD;
and took the basket and the bundle from her hands and set&#xD;
them down, and set a chair for her, and made her sit down&#xD;
in it, while h~ said-&#xD;
"My dear child! my excellent child, you do too much for'&#xD;
rue! You hurt yourself, Catherine, and make me too deeply&#xD;
your debtor !"&#xD;
Kate waved her hand in that quick, short way peculiar to&#xD;
herself, silently beseeching him to stop.&#xD;
"But it is the truth, Catheri&#xD;
be able to repay you ~     ne, my child!  I shall nevor&#xD;
"Oh, sir! you have reversed the case! It is I who am&#xD;
i~'our debtor! If I were not par4culariy your debtor for all&#xD;

ever received, up to the time of my coining to Ilardbargaifl&#xD;
still I should be generally your debtor, as youth is the gene-&#xD;
ral debtor of age~oWiflg it all the service it can give."&#xD;
Then, to change the subject, the girl laid off her straw hat,&#xD;
drew off her sheep-skin home-made mittens, and arose and un-&#xD;
covered her basket, saying~.~~~In5tead of a loaf of rising bread,&#xD;
Mr. Saunders, I have brought you some fresh biscuits; I&#xD;
thought they might be an agreeable change. There is also&#xD;
a fresh print of butter, and a bottle of cream, and a beef's&#xD;
tongue, boiled-T thought the last would give you an ~ppe-&#xD;
tite-I think you have not had a good appetite, lately !"&#xD;
And without more ado Catherine put the things away in the&#xD;
cupboard, setting the bottle of cream in a bowl of water, to&#xD;
keep cool, and ~4shing to herself that she had a lump of ice&#xD;
to put on the old man's print of butter. Next, she unrolled&#xD;
the bundle, took the old man's nicely washed and mended&#xD;
clothes, and put them neatlyy away in the chest of drawers.&#xD;
Then she set the empty basket aside, rolled up her sleeves,&#xD;
stooped down upon the hearth, and began to make the fire,&#xD;
saying-" You know I have come to dine with you to-day,&#xD;
Mr. Saunders!"&#xD;
"I know you have come to bring me many comforts,&#xD;
and to cook my dinner, and clean np my house, and&#xD;
make me very comfortable, you good girl, my dear little&#xD;
Brownie ~&#xD;
Catherine moved about, in her quick and quiet way-&#xD;
filled and put on the kettle-for the old man would always&#xD;
have his cup of tea--and set the table, placing all the little&#xD;
rarities she had brought upon it. When all was ready, and&#xD;
they sat down, the old man found leisure to observe that&#xD;
Kate ate notl~ing, and looked pale and thoughtful.&#xD;
"What is the matter, my dear Kate 'i-yoU who are always&#xD;
serious; are now positively sorrowful! What is it V'&#xD;
Kate, who was truth itself whenever she spoke, chose for&#xD;
that reasofl to give no answer.&#xD;
The old man looked more and mo1~e disturbed, and laying&#xD;
down his knife and fork, said-&#xD;
"Nay, hut Catherine, my dear child, there is something&#xD;
the matter! I do not wish to intrude on your confidence,&#xD;

"Dear Mr. Saunders, don't trouble your good heart about&#xD;
my cloudy face. Sure and hasn't a poor girl the same right&#xD;
to her smoke that a wealthy young lady has to her vapors ~"&#xD;
said Kate, smiling.&#xD;
The old minister did not press his question, but resumed his&#xD;
knife and fork with a look of mortification that worried (lath-&#xD;
erine, so that she said-.&#xD;
"I will tell you, then, what troubles me. My dearest,&#xD;
best friend and patron, Captain Clifton, has bidden me good-&#xD;
bye, and departed for the frontier! That is bad-oh, yes!&#xD;
-'-.very bad. But that is not the worst. He has gone away&#xD;
very unhappy. I might as well tell you what everybody&#xD;
will soon know :-his marriage is broken off! He has gone&#xD;
away in anger with his promised bride; He has gone away&#xD;
so wretched! Mr. Saunders, when I saw him last night,&#xD;
looking so pale, and stern, and proud-and knew the haugh-&#xD;
tiness and the anguish of his heart, I thought I could have&#xD;
died to have restored peace and joy between him and her he&#xD;
loved so strongly."&#xD;
"Merciful Heaven !-those Cliftons! This is another in-&#xD;
stance of their fatal subjection to passion! Do you know,&#xD;
my dear child, what caused this quarrel V'&#xD;
"I know nothing but this-the marriage is broken off for&#xD;
the present! I do not know wherefore."&#xD;
"Some jealous suspicion of one party or the other!&#xD;
Those Cliftons all have Spanish blood in them, and the Span-&#xD;
ish character is uppermost in their nature. They are all&#xD;
haughty, reserved, jealous, stispicious."&#xD;
"Ah, but 4hey are full of courage, mag1~animity and be..&#xD;
nevolence," said Catherine.&#xD;
"Archer Clifton is of a very jealous and suspicious nature&#xD;
~-was his betrothed inclined to coquetry '~"&#xD;
"Oh, I do not know, sir, but the misunderstanding did&#xD;
not originate in any charge against Miss Clifton. It was&#xD;
something of which Miss Clifton accused him, but of what, I&#xD;
do not know i-he did not say. My dear Mr. Saunders, I&#xD;
told you what troubled me, to satisfy your kind heart, and&#xD;
allay your benevolent anxiety* on my account. And now&#xD;
please forgive me, for beseeching you not to question me&#xD;
&#xD;
farther upon the subject. They-the parties, I mean-are&#xD;
far removed above my sphere of thought and action-and the&#xD;
investigation of their motives of action, by me, seems to in..&#xD;
volve a certain indelicacy-I fear even impertinence of inter-&#xD;
ference," said Catherine, gently.&#xD;
"Yet, far above your sphere of thought and action as you&#xD;
say they are, they are not-at least one of them is not-&#xD;
above your sphere of sympathy and emotion. His sorrow&#xD;
affects you with sorrow&#xD;
The blood rushed to Kate's brow, and she remained silent.&#xD;
The old man and the maiden soon after arose from the&#xD;
table. She washed up the dishes, tidied up the house, and&#xD;
collected the poor preacher's soiled an4 broken clothes, and&#xD;
tied them in a bundle to take away with her to wash and&#xD;
mend. Then she tied on her hat, and took leave of him;&#xD;
the old man calling her back, again and again, with vague,&#xD;
prophetic meaning, to repeat over and over-" God bless you,&#xD;
my child! God bless you !" It was his dying benediction.&#xD;
A poor mountaineer, that called early the next morning&#xD;
to get the poor minister to the poor to come and bury his&#xD;
wife-found the old man dead.&#xD;

Mus. IIEMANS.&#xD;
ALL the forenoon, Carolyn Clifton sat in the same place and&#xD;
in the same attitude in which we left her, affecting to read,&#xD;
but ~really watching the mountain-path with heart-sickening&#xD;
anxiety. Every distant sound of a horse's hoofs that struck&#xD;
upon her ear, sent an electric shock to her heart, causing her&#xD;
to start violently, tremble, and turn deadly sick and faint,&#xD;
with accelerated hope and fear, until its nearer approach re-&#xD;
vealed sonic neighbor going on his way, or some negro com-&#xD;
ing from the mill or the village, to her despairing sight.&#xD;
Even the sound of carriage wheels, as they occasionally rolled&#xD;
by, made her heart pause in its pulsations until it passed, and&#xD;
proved to be some family going on a visit or a shopping er-&#xD;
rand.-For still she hoped that if he did not come down the&#xD;
mountain-path on horseback, he might come round the road&#xD;
with his mother in her carriage. He came not. And oh,&#xD;
the wedding day was almost over! No one saw the strife of&#xD;
hope and fear, like the sti'uggle of life and death, going on&#xD;
silently in her bosom. Mrs. ~Georgia Clifton spent the whole&#xD;
forenoon in her own apartment, professing to be engaged&#xD;
with many elegant preparations for the evening; but really&#xD;
full of triumph for the success of her wicked scheming, and&#xD;
&#xD;
anxiety and wonder for the events of the evening, and dark&#xD;
regret also for the absence of him who, if lost to Carolyn&#xD;
foi'ever, was lost to herself for a time at least. Wiffi all&#xD;
these passions and emotions striving in her bosom, she dared&#xD;
not show herself, lest her conscious heart and conscious face&#xD;
should betray her-for Georgia was yet young in wickedness.&#xD;
The Misses Cabell were in their own chamber, putting a&#xD;
few finishing touches to their dresses for the evening, for&#xD;
they, with Zuleime, were to be the bridesmaids.&#xD;
Zuleime herself had not yet returned, although it was near&#xD;
noon.&#xD;
Old Mr. Clifton had been out, as was his daily habit of a&#xD;
forenoon, riding around his plantation.&#xD;
He came in to-day a little earlier than usual, and finding&#xD;
his daughter exactly where he left her, but looking still more&#xD;
pale, haggard and anxious than in the morning, he sat down&#xD;
by her side, put his arm tenderly around her waist, and&#xD;
gazed lovingly into her whitened and sharpened countenance,&#xD;
before he said interrogatively-&#xD;
"Not come yet, Carolyn ~"&#xD;
"No ,sir !" answered the young lady, rising and putting&#xD;
off her father's caressing arm, and her own humiliating des-&#xD;
pondency, with a proud and queenly air.&#xD;
"Well!" said the old man, with sudden energy, "I WILL&#xD;
certainly now ride up to Hardbargain and know' the reason.&#xD;
DANDY !-my horse, there! Bring him back !-I've not&#xD;
done with him !"&#xD;
"Father !" said Carolyn, seizing his hand, and detaining&#xD;
him, while she raised her head and looked and spoke in a&#xD;
manner that reminded him more strongly than ever of her&#xD;
arrogant mother, "Father, no, you will not go! No, no,&#xD;
father, if you have any love for me, any respect for the&#xD;
memory of my dead mother, do not subject her daughter and&#xD;
yours to such a mortification! No, father, if he never comes,&#xD;
never go after him !"&#xD;
"You're a fool, girl !" cried the old man, breaking away&#xD;
from her, "a palpable fool !-You were a fool for quarreling&#xD;
with him and sending him away, and now you are a greater&#xD;
fool for persisting in the quarrel. 'Mortification,' indeed!&#xD;
Who'll be the most mortified this. evening, II wonder, 'if he&#xD;
never comes ~' What the deuce are we to say to the~people&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIFTDN.&#xD;
&#xD;
who will come here this evening to see you married?~ Tell&#xD;
me that ?"&#xD;
Before she could say another word, a large family carriage&#xD;
rolled down the road, and turned and entered the lawn.&#xD;
Carolyn sank back in her seat, nearly swooning with the&#xD;
swift hope and fear that strove almost to agony as she gazed.&#xD;
It looked so like Mrs. Clifton's carriage.&#xD;
It was not, Jiiowever. It contained the very earliest of the&#xD;
wedding guests, who, coming from a distance of thirty miles;&#xD;
had set out early enough to arrive in time to secure a Whole&#xD;
afternoon's rest and refreshment before dressing foil the&#xD;
evening. This was customary with those coming from afar.&#xD;
Old Mr. Clifton went down the steps, to receive his guests.&#xD;
Carolyn arose and withdrew into the house, fortunately&#xD;
before she had been recognized by the visitors; for it would&#xD;
have been shockingly out of all etiquette for a bride to be&#xD;
visible on her wedding-day before the wedding-hour.&#xD;
When Mr. Clifton had ushered his guests into the drawing-&#xD;
room, he returned to the piazza to give some directions con-&#xD;
cerning the stabling of the horses, for where so many animals&#xD;
were expected to be provided for, it required some extra&#xD;
thought and care in their bestowal. While still giving his&#xD;
orders, he saw his younger daughter riding slowly up to 'the&#xD;
house. Pleased to see her return in safety, in spite of his&#xD;
evil forebodings of the morning, and thinking besides that&#xD;
she could give him some news of the laggard bridegroom, lie&#xD;
hastened to . meet her and lift her from the saddle, with a&#xD;
joyous-&#xD;
"Well, my darling! well, my damask rose-bud! Back&#xD;
in time, according to promise, eh ?"&#xD;
But at the sight of her father, the girl's face flushed and&#xD;
paled so swiftly, her bosom rose. and fell so rapidly, her&#xD;
whole frame was so agitated, her manner so confused, that&#xD;
the old man was seized with alarm, and exclaimed, hur-&#xD;
riedly.-&#xD;
"In the name of Heaven, my dearest child, what is the&#xD;
matter ?"&#xD;
But Zuleime, incapable of reply, looked as 'if she would&#xD;
sink into the ground.&#xD;
Mr. Clifton's first definite thought was that some a~~cident&#xD;
or catastrophe had befallen the bridegroom.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Good Heaven, Zuleime, what has happened? Where is&#xD;
Archer Clifton? Speak-has he come to any harm ?"&#xD;
Much relieved that her father's suspicions had fallen out&#xD;
of the true track-yet still considerably shaken, Zuleime re-&#xD;
plied, in a faltering voice; that Captain Clifton had received&#xD;
orders', and had departed that morning with IAeutenant&#xD;
Fairfax for Winchester, where their regiment was quartered,&#xD;
and that Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, desired to see Mr.&#xD;
Clifton as soon as possible. Without another word-totally&#xD;
unsuspicious that Mrs. Fairfax stood before him-the old&#xD;
man threw himself on horseback, and rode furiously toward&#xD;
llardbargain.&#xD;
Mrs. Frank Fairfax, our runaway daughter, and widowed&#xD;
bride, stole to her own little room to weep in secret, a little&#xD;
over her fault, but a great deal over the absence of and the&#xD;
danger about to befall her husband.&#xD;
Dinner was served without Mr. Clifton, Miss Clifton,&#xD;
Zuleime, and the Misses Cabell. Mrs. Georgia Clifton alone&#xD;
entertained the newly arrived company. This did not occa-&#xD;
sion remark. Mr. Clifton was known to be absent, and it&#xD;
was customary, as I said before, for the bride and her&#xD;
attendants to be invisible.&#xD;
In the meantime, Carolyn Clifton sat in her chamber-&#xD;
pride, love, regret, anger, hope, fear-al1~goOd and evil pas-&#xD;
sions striving in her soul, or in turn holding the mastery over&#xD;
it. It was drawing near the hour when she should commence&#xD;
her bridal toilet, if indeed any bridal array was to be assumed&#xD;
that evening. Amidst all her keen anxiety, she dreaded lest&#xD;
some one should come in and tell her it was time to dress.&#xD;
What should her proud heart permit her to explain to such&#xD;
a one. She need not have feared interruption, however.&#xD;
The Misses Cabell, her bridesmaids, it is true, sat together&#xD;
in their chamber very impatiently awaiting a message from&#xD;
the bride-very impatiently, indeed, for after her ceremonious&#xD;
dressing, they had their own very elaborate toilet to make.&#xD;
But they wo~ild not enter. hdr dressing-room unsummoned,&#xD;
or at least until they should receive from some member of the&#xD;
family a suggestion that it was now proper to do so. And&#xD;
no one thought or remembered to give them the hint.&#xD;
Mrs. Georgia Clifton~self~conviCted of being the' origina-&#xD;
tor of all the great trouble that had befallen, and the greater&#xD;

that was about to befall the house-kept herself as much as&#xD;
possible aloof.&#xD;
And Zuleime was as yet too deeply absorbed in the con-&#xD;
templation of her own recent bridehood, and the sorrow of&#xD;
her widowhood, to think of anything else.&#xD;
Meanwhile old Mr. Clifton had ridden as for life up to&#xD;
Ilardbargain, thrown' himself from his horse, flung the bridle&#xD;
upon his neck and let him go loese, while he himself rushed&#xD;
up the stairs and into the hall, and without the ceremony of&#xD;
a 'rap, burst into the quiet presence of Mrs. Clifton as she&#xD;
sat sewing in her shady parlor. She arose calmly to receive&#xD;
him; and the very quietness of the lady threw the excited&#xD;
old gentleman off his guard, and out of his politeness, and&#xD;
into a rage.&#xD;
"Well, madam !" he exclaimed, throwing his hat down&#xD;
with a thump into a chair, and tramping up and down the&#xD;
floor. "Here's a pretty state of affairs !"&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, you are excited."&#xD;
"Yes, madam, I AM excited !" interrupted the old man-&#xD;
"very muek excited, madam! Very much excited, indeed,&#xD;
madam! Where is Archer Clifton? tell me that !"&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, sit down and compose yourself!"&#xD;
"Compose myself! Compose myself with a prospect of&#xD;
three hundred people pouring into my house to-night, each&#xD;
one of them agape to see a wedding, and to have to tell them&#xD;
there will be no wedding !"&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, you can't regret this circumstance more&#xD;
than I do!"&#xD;
"I don't regret it at all, ma'am! I rejoice at it, nia'am!&#xD;
I congr~itulate myself and my daughter, ma'am! But I'll&#xD;
have satisfaction, ma'am! I'll have satisfaction, ma'am "'&#xD;
said the old man, wiping the perspiration from his red face.&#xD;
"Satisfaction for what you rejoice at, Mr. Clifton ?" in-&#xD;
quired the lady, smiling at his unreasonable anger with her-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
"J'll-yes~I'll have satisfaction, ma'am !"&#xD;
"From whom? From me? Do you intend to call me&#xD;
out as my son's representative? Do you wish to compel me&#xD;
to fight a duel; or to make an apology~which ?" inquired&#xD;
the laiy, coolly.&#xD;
"Dem it, mem, I'll-I'll have satisfaction !" exclaimed&#xD;
&#xD;
TilE OURSI~ OF CLIFTON           147&#xD;
the old man, growing shorter and shorter in his syllables.&#xD;
"I'll-I'll write to the Colonel of the regiment! I'll-I'll&#xD;
make the matter known to the Major General of the Army!'&#xD;
I'll-yes, dem-nie! P11 go to Washington and tell the Presi-&#xD;
dent! I'll have that young rascal cashiered, and broken and&#xD;
dismissed from the service !"&#xD;
"What! all three f Why, that is passing cruel! Quite&#xD;
as bad as being killed and murdered, and mortally wounded!"&#xD;
said the lady, smiling at his insane vehemence.&#xD;
"Dem it, mem! don't take my words up !" he exclaimed,&#xD;
stamping up and down the floor, and then breaking out into&#xD;
vituperative abuse of Archer Clifton, all addressed to Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton, who, though becoming very much agitated, now pre-&#xD;
served a dignified silence.&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton forgets that he is a man, and that he speaks&#xD;
to a woman !" said a stern, but low-toned voice.&#xD;
And the old gentleman turned to see Kate Kavanagh,&#xD;
"severe in youthful beauty," standing within the door; yes,&#xD;
in becutty, for her slight figure was drawn gracefully up-her&#xD;
bosom heaving, her fine head erected, her cheeks crimson,&#xD;
and her eyes intensely brilliant with the ~just indignation that&#xD;
moved her soul, as she walked straight up to Mrs. Clifton,&#xD;
and said-&#xD;
"Dearest lady, allow me-do allow me to attend you to your&#xD;
own room, and be your substitute here, in waiting upon Mr.&#xD;
Clifton."&#xD;
"No, Kate-no, my dear girl. I have to talk rationally&#xD;
t~ the man as soon as he comes to his senses," replied the lady.&#xD;
"Who is that girl ?" inquired the old gentleman, not re~&#xD;
cognizing Kate under the new aspect-or affecting not to do&#xD;
so. "Who is that girl, Mrs. Clifton ?" he repeated, while&#xD;
the lady gazed fondly on her prot6g~.&#xD;
"Miss Kavanagh my son's ward, and my own adopted&#xD;
daughter," replied Mrs. Clifton, without withdrawing her&#xD;
fond gaze from the face of Kate, who was blushing under it.&#xD;
"Miss Kavanagh, your son's ward, and your own adopted&#xD;
daughter! A promising relationship all around, that is-up&#xD;
~ou~-.my~wordit is !" said Mr. Clifton, very deliber-&#xD;
ately. "However," he added, "she has brought me to re-&#xD;

lence of speech and manner; it is a family failing, you know.&#xD;
Pray pardon me."&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, please' to sit down near me.' My voice is&#xD;
not strong. It may be disquietude, but I find a difficulty in&#xD;
raising it, or in keeping up a running conversation."&#xD;
"My dear sister, I am afraid your lungs grow weak! I nrn&#xD;
indeed! I have noticed it before. I ~have said the same to&#xD;
Georgia and to Carolyn! Indeed, my dear sister Clifton, I&#xD;
wish you would take care of yourself. I was a brute to throw&#xD;
myself into a passion in your presence. I was, indeed! I&#xD;
see it has overcome you! Kate Kavanagh, my dear, you&#xD;
Were perfectly right. I did forget myself. And you were&#xD;
a fine girl to recall inc. Give me your hand, my dear."&#xD;
Blushing deeply, as was her wont when praised, Kate gave&#xD;
het hand, saying-half apologetically, half appealingly.-....&#xD;
"Mrs. Clifton is not strong, sir. She should not be&#xD;
agitated, especially so soon after her son has left her."&#xD;
"I know she is not strong! 1VJy dear sister, I wish you'd&#xD;
b&amp;amp;careful of yourself! I do, indeed! You're not strong."&#xD;
"After fifty, we do not grow strong as we grow old," said&#xD;
the lady, pointing to a chair by her side, and indicating that&#xD;
he should take it! lie did so. And then Mrs. Clifton&#xD;
turned to Kate, and said-.&#xD;
"Now Catherine, my dear, I wish you to go up into my&#xD;
chamber and amuse yourself with a book, while I have a&#xD;
confidential talk with Mr. Clifton."&#xD;
Kate immediately arose, courtesies, and left the room.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton turned to her brother-in--law, and said, iyzp&#xD;
quiringly, "You know the cause of this lovers' quarrel ?"&#xD;
"Of course I do, madam ~ Satan fly away with them&#xD;
both! I know all about it! It was about her-up stairs!"&#xD;
he replied, indicating Kate KaviLnagh by a crook of his thumb.&#xD;
"Yes; it was about Kate. But it was very absurd !"&#xD;
"Now, I don't know that ma'ain!"&#xD;
"But it certainly was-ridiculous! Mr. Clifton! she,&#xD;
Catherine, knows nothing about it! Does not even dream&#xD;
that she herself had the remotest connection with the quarrel,&#xD;
and I do hope and trust, that she never may suspect it. What&#xD;
I wish to say to you, is plainly this: That I know enough&#xD;
of human nature generally, and of young people particularly,&#xD;
and of Archer and Carolyn individually, to feel sure that this&#xD;

"Yes, very extremely inconvenient, indeed !" emphatiCallY&#xD;
interrupted the old man.&#xD;
"Is only temporary-&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am, but that don't make it the less embarrass-&#xD;
ing-the less inconvenient !"&#xD;
"I know it! Hear me out !"&#xD;
"What the deuce, ma'am, are we to do with the people&#xD;
who are coming to the wedding even now&#xD;
"I am about to tell you, if you will quietly listen to me."&#xD;
"Well! well! Yes, ma'am! I beg your pardon-I am&#xD;
all attention."&#xD;
~'Carolyn, I am sure, already regrets her hasty violence&#xD;
of temper."&#xD;
"Yes! that she does! It's easy to see that !"&#xD;
"And Archer, who is slower to anger and slower to re-&#xD;
pentance~4hough deeper and stronger in both for being&#xD;
siow~Archer, in a very few days, will bitterly repent the&#xD;
step he has taken, more especially as being on his Western&#xD;
march, it will be impossible to retrace it. Under these cir-&#xD;
cuinstances, this is what you must say to the assembled&#xD;

peremptory order arrived for Captain Clifton to join his regi-&#xD;

present. Let the company then enjoy themselves as at a ball.&#xD;
And all will go off well, and without scandal. I will be&#xD;
present myself, as the representativee of our side of the house.&#xD;
II sent for you, Mr. Clifton, to give you this advice, and to&#xD;
suggest this plan of action in meeting the embari~as5ing diffi-&#xD;
culties of this evening. I should not propose this, if I were&#xD;
pot sure that the marriage is only deferrecV~that if the par-&#xD;

Mr. Clifton! I am willingtO pledge my own truth and honor&#xD;
on it, and become responsible for it! The plan I propose to&#xD;
you for meeting the guests this evening, is truest, wisest and&#xD;

"I do not think of it at all! I see its excellence at a&#xD;

You'll see how gloriously I'll execute your orders! You'll&#xD;
make me Lieutenant-General when you are Lady Protector&#xD;

and clapping his hat upon his head, and joking like a boy,&#xD;
for very joy that his difficulty was smoothed. lie shook hands&#xD;
with Mrs. Clifton, begging her not to be late, as he should&#xD;
want the encouragement of her presence in order to enable&#xD;
him to make his speech. Then he mounted his horse, and&#xD;
rode rapidly away down the mountain-path to Clifton. When&#xD;
he arrived at home, he found the lawn already covered with&#xD;
carriages, horses and Servants, and the piazza, halls, and all&#xD;
the first floor rooms, thronged with company. lie passed,&#xD;
through them all, bowing right and left and hastened to his&#xD;
daughter's room. Mr. Clifton had some doubts about getting&#xD;
his proud daughter to consent to the wise plan suggested by&#xD;
his sister-in-law. But he meant to carry his consent by a&#xD;
coup-de-.main. So he pushed open her door, burst into her&#xD;
chamber, and threw himself, puffing, blowing, and perspiring,&#xD;
into the nearest chair, exclaiming-.&#xD;
"He's gone, Oarolyn! He's clear ,gone, confound him !"&#xD;
Carolyn drew nearer her father, and gazed into his face,&#xD;
to read there the confirmation of what she scarcely could be-&#xD;
lieve. The old man wiped his streaming face with his hand-&#xD;
kerchief, and stuffed it again into his pocket, exclaiming-.&#xD;
"Yes! he's gone! gone! gone! gone!" Then opening&#xD;
wide his arms, 'he murmured, "But never mind, my dear&#xD;
child! you've got your o14 father left to love you, and to&#xD;
avenge you, too, if needful! Don't grieve! Come to my&#xD;
bosom! Don't grieve !"&#xD;
"'Grieve,' sir !" exclaimed the imperious girl, elevating&#xD;
her queenly head, "we do not grieve for a traitor! We&#xD;
pronounce sentence on him, and execute it !"&#xD;
"True! true! my noble girl! There spoke ybur mother's&#xD;
daughter! Yet-." suddenly cried the old gentleman, as by&#xD;
a quick recollection and revulsion of feeling, "what a devil&#xD;
of a kettle of fish this is, my dear! Blame the fellow, what&#xD;
are we to 'do ~ Deuce take the man-what are we to say to&#xD;

Carolyn stood in proud and bitter thought for some minutes,&#xD;
and then she smiled, with a scornful smile, and said-&#xD;
"190 nothing, sir Let all go on as was planned!. Let&#xD;
the band of music take its place in the saloon! Let the&#xD;
wedding guests come, and be received! And then' leave all&#xD;
the rest to me! And now, my dear father, pray excuse me,&#xD;
as it is time to dress."&#xD;
"To dress! Why, Carolyn, what do you mean ~ Are&#xD;
you mad ~ Dress for what ?" asked the old gentleman,&#xD;
anxious to know if perchance her idea in any way resembled&#xD;
the plan adopted by himself, from Mrs. Clifton's suggestion.&#xD;
"No, sir! I am not mad. 'My pulse, as yours, doth&#xD;
temperately keep time,'" said the young lady, extending her&#xD;
hand to the bell-rope, and ringing a peal that presently&#xD;
brought her woman hurrying up stairs and into her presence.&#xD;
"IDarky !" said she addressing her attendant, "go to Miss&#xD;
Zuleime, and to the Misses Cabell, and let them know that I&#xD;

will have a conversation, in which I will tell you my simple&#xD;
plan for getting through the evening. I have not quite nia-&#xD;

couple of hours, father !"&#xD;
She opened the door for her father, who just escaped the&#xD;
young bridesmaids, who were coming in.&#xD;
lie went out muttering-&#xD;
"I don't know what she means. I suppose I can have&#xD;
confidence in her. At least I must for the present, and then,.&#xD;
there is Mrs. Clifton's plan." He went into his own room.&#xD;
and arrayed himself in festive garments for the occasion, and&#xD;
then went below stairs to groan inwardly over the numerous&#xD;
arrivals of guests, whose carriages' thronged the lawn, and&#xD;
whose servants crowded the piazza, hall and entries. Pre-&#xD;
sently a servant approached him, 'and ~aid, respectfully, in a&#xD;

CC Father !" she said, "I will not wear the willow for a re-&#xD;
creant lover! 1 have determined that the festivities shall go&#xD;
on to-night. I will go down and lead off the first dance my..&#xD;
self. You, my father, may explain, as you please, that the&#xD;
marriage is broken off, but that the music, dancing, and feast..&#xD;
ing are not arrested for that reason."&#xD;
The old man had determined within himself what to speak,&#xD;
but he answered....~&#xD;
"My dear child, are you equal to it ~"&#xD;
"Equal sir? Try me !"&#xD;
"Very well, my dear. Come! And I will say-what is&#xD;
proper upon the occasion."&#xD;
In the meanwhile the splendid company assembled in the&#xD;
brilliantly lighted saloon, awaited with great impatience the&#xD;
entree of the bridal train.&#xD;
Made conspicuous in that gorgeous assembly by his black&#xD;
gown and bands, sat the clergyman who was to perform the&#xD;
ceremony.&#xD;
Georgia..darkly, resplendently beautiful as ever, moved&#xD;
gracefully through the crowd.-....fulI of gracious courtesy, yet'&#xD;
flushed, anxious, feverish.......half fearing' that the bridegroom&#xD;
would appear at this last moment. This fear was aroused&#xD;
by the presence, and the calm, eheerftil, self~possessed looks&#xD;
of Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain. At length light steps were&#xD;
heard in the hall. The doors of the saloon were thrown&#xD;
open. And all eyes were turned to see the wedding pro-&#xD;
cession enter. But instead of a bridal train, came old&#xD;
Mr. Clifton, leading in his daughter Carolyn. The surprise,&#xD;
the wonder of the company was at first silent and breathless&#xD;
as it was profound. But soon a low whisper arose, and like&#xD;
a low 'breeze in the leaves, passed from one to another, until&#xD;
the room was in a general buzz.&#xD;
Mr. Clifton led his daughter into the centre of the saloon,&#xD;
and with her still hanging on his arm, 'turned and faced the&#xD;
company, waiting until they should be silent before he would&#xD;
speak. The father and daughter, as they stood there, pre-&#xD;
sented a fine, imposing appearance. Both were arrayed with&#xD;
the gorgeous splendor that prevailed at that day.&#xD;
The old gentleman had his snow-white hair turned back&#xD;
off his forehead, and carried all down to the nape of his&#xD;
neck, where it was plaited into a queue, and adorned with a&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE 013' CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
large white satin bow, both snowy plait and bow in pleasant&#xD;
relief against the back of the dark crimson velvet coat-his&#xD;
vest and small clothes were of white satin, and his long hose&#xD;
of white silk were fastened to the small-clothes below the knee&#xD;
with white satin bows and gold buckles-his slippers were&#xD;
of crimson morocco, with high heels, large bows, and gold&#xD;
buckles. His dress was rather antiquated even for that day.&#xD;
And he stood there waiting for silence with the suave and&#xD;
stately courtesy of the old school gentleman.&#xD;
Very much like a queen looked the beautiful Carolyn, 'but&#xD;
very little like a bride, either in her dignified. self-possession,&#xD;
or in her magnificent array. Her fair hair was carried up&#xD;
above her forehead, and dressed high, in the regal style of&#xD;
that day. Its rich waves and bands were wreathed with&#xD;
pearls, and adorned with a plums of white ostrich feathers,&#xD;
powdered with minute silver spangles. Her neck and arms&#xD;
were bare, but adorned with pearls, and softly shaded with&#xD;
the finest lace at the edge of the bodice and sleeves. Her&#xD;
dress was of rich blue satin brocade, made with long waist,&#xD;
sharp pointed stomacher, and flowing sleeves and flowing&#xD;
skirt-the edges of the skirt finished with a very deep border&#xD;
of silver embroidery; a lighter border of the same running&#xD;
around the sleeves; the stomacher ~vas embroidered with sil-&#xD;
ver and pearls. Over her skirt she wore a train of splendid&#xD;
lace, lightly embroidered with a running vine of silver. She&#xD;
toyed with an elegant fan of carved mother-of-pearl and&#xD;
marabout feathers. She stood there, as I said, not at all&#xD;
like a bride, either in her gorgeous apparel, or her self-assert-&#xD;
ing manner. She stood there with a gay, proud air, beneath&#xD;
which none could have discerned the deeply humiliated spirit&#xD;
of the arrogant woman, or suspected the wounded and&#xD;
breaking heart of the forsaken bride.-When the murmur of&#xD;
voices which had greeted their entrance had subsided, and&#xD;
silence was restored, Mr. Clifton bowed deeply, and-win the&#xD;
somewhat high-flown grandiloquence of style he had once'&#xD;
soon exhibited by a manager of a city theatre, when apolo-&#xD;
gisii~g for the' non-appearance of the evening's star-spoke&#xD;
as follows: "Ladies and gentlemen, the distinction of your&#xD;

dignity of your society here for that purpose." (An embar&#xD;
raised pause, while the assembly listened in breathless cnn.&#xD;
osity and expectation, and he continued,) "Ladies and gentle&#xD;
men, 'man proposes, but God disposes.' The great Arbiter&#xD;
of destiny has ordained the issue of events otherwise than&#xD;
as we had hoped, planned, and expected. Even last night&#xD;
suddenly came a peremptory order from head-quarters, to&#xD;
Captain Clifton, to join his regiment instantly for the purpose&#xD;
of taking the command of a detachment of cavalry, to march&#xD;
immediately to the Indian frontier to put down an irruption&#xD;
of the Shoshowanawas! Ladies and gentlemen !" (continued&#xD;
the old gentleman, warming up with his subject,) "you know&#xD;
the stern, uncompromising duty of the soldier at such a cri-&#xD;
sis. One syllable~one single syllable comprehends his in-&#xD;
supportable obligation-' Go.' The man, the lover, the&#xD;
bridegroom must give place to the soldier. As our greatest&#xD;

trumpet, must&#xD;
~C C Leave unterided the herd,&#xD;
The floek without shelter,&#xD;
The dead uninterred,&#xD;

"Ladies and gentlemen, our gallant Captain Clifton has&#xD;
literally left his 'bride at the altar.' But soldier's love may&#xD;
not mourn bridegroom's loss. Nor may we deny ourselves&#xD;
the distinction and joy of your presence for the whole night&#xD;
-nor," (the old man was unconsciously sliding from his&#xD;
lofty magniloquence down to the plain vernacular,) "nor&#xD;
must I disappoint these young men and maidens of their&#xD;
dance to-night. lie! music there! Strike up the liveliest&#xD;
quadrille air t~pon your list. Let them dance to the briskest&#xD;
music while they are fresh. Charley Cabell, my boy, come&#xD;
here and lead out your cousin Carolyn !"&#xD;
Major Cabell advanced, and with much grace and dignity&#xD;
led Miss Clifton to the head of the quadrille, as the music&#xD;
pealed forth.&#xD;
"Young gentlemen, select your partners!" exclaimed the&#xD;
old man, adding example to precept, by choosing the youngest&#xD;
and prettiest girl in the room, and leading her to the place&#xD;
right opposite his nephew and daughter. Soon all the Sur-&#xD;
prise and disappointment were forgotten in enjoyment The&#xD;
&#xD;
evening was spent in the gayest hilarity~~Carolyn Clifton,&#xD;
the forsaken bride, apparently the gayest of the gay. So&#xD;
gay, indeed, was Miss Clifton, that she drew upon herself the&#xD;
severe animadversions of several ladies present, who affirmed&#xD;
that her conduct was heartless in the extreme; to laugh and&#xD;
sing and dance and jest with such thorough abandonment to&#xD;
pleasure, just after the departure of her lover to brave the&#xD;
ghastly horrors of Indian warfare. Much more did they&#xD;
approve of the pensive manners of Zuleime. Poor Zuleime&#xD;
was all unskilled in self~contrOl~her heart was "exceeding&#xD;
sorrowful," and so she let it appear. The company separated&#xD;
at a very late hour that night, or rather a very early hour&#xD;
of the next morning. Those in the neighborhood departing,&#xD;
those from a distance retiring to the chambers to take some&#xD;
sleep before breakfast, after which they were to set out for&#xD;

THE 5ISTEfl5.&#xD;
Sister! Since I met thee last,&#xD;
O'er thy brow a change hat h past;&#xD;
In the softness of thine eyes,&#xD;
Deep and still a shadow lies;&#xD;
From thy Voice there thrills a tone,&#xD;
Never to thy childhood known;&#xD;
Through thy soul a storm bath moved,&#xD;
-Gentle sister, thou hath loved.&#xD;
OVERTASKED, weary and exhausted by her lon~g efforts,&#xD;
Caiolyn Clifton sought her own chamber, and threw herself,&#xD;
all splendidly arrayed ~ts she was, upon her bed. She had&#xD;
no fear of interruption, for it was not yet daybreak, and her&#xD;
woman would not be up for several hours. So she was sur-&#xD;
prised, and not at all pleased when a gentle rap came to the&#xD;
door. She would not answer or move to let the rapper know&#xD;
that she was awake. She was weary, weary with acting for&#xD;
one night, and needed rest. But after the unknown had&#xD;
rapped two or three times, the door was gently opened, and&#xD;
the sweet voice of Zuleime was heard to say-&#xD;
"Sister, I know you are not asleep~will you let me come&#xD;
in ~" And without waiting for an answer, she entered, and&#xD;
softly closed the doqr, and can~e to the bedside, saying-" I&#xD;
heard you when you came up and threw yourself down on&#xD;
the bed, and I knew you were not asleep-let me stay with&#xD;
you, dear sister, Won't you ?"&#xD;
no, Zuleime, I wish to sleep," said Carolyn, still&#xD;
~p~'essing both hands to her throbbing temples.&#xD;
"Well, then, dear Carolyn, let me undress you, you can&#xD;
never compose yourself in that dress ;" and the affectionate&#xD;
girl began fo take off her slippers and stockings, saying-" I&#xD;
can take off all the small articles, and unlace your stomacher&#xD;
without disturbing you, sister, and then you need not ~tand&#xD;
up more than a minute to disrobe."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CUI~SE OF CLI~FTON.          16T&#xD;
In indifference or abstraction, Miss Clifton p5mitted the&#xD;
gentle girl to unclasp all her jewels, and loosen her dress,&#xD;
without ever removing her hands, clasped tightly upon her&#xD;
temples, till Zuleime, wishing to take down the elaborate&#xD;
coiffure, gently withdrew them, and unwound the strings of&#xD;
pearls, and unfastened the plume of feathers. When the&#xD;
affectionate girl had laid aside all these glittering gewgaws,&#xD;
and freed her long, fair hair, and relieved her oppressed and&#xD;
fevered head, the proud and scornful Carolyn, subdued by&#xD;
the gentleness of her sweet, only sister, looked in her face,&#xD;
read there a strange sympathy, delicate as it was deep, and&#xD;
suddenly put her arms around her neck, drew her head down&#xD;
to her own, and kissed her fondly, murmuring-&#xD;
"Oh, Zuleime! my child, my child! if you knew-"&#xD;
"I do know, dearest Carolyn! IDearest sister, I ~u1o know&#xD;
it all! all! and feel it-feel it from the bottom of my heart!&#xD;
That is the reason I came in, Carolyn! But I did not come&#xD;
in to disturb you, even by my sympathy. I came in to put&#xD;
you to sleep. Stand up, dearest Carolyn, and drop these~&#xD;
heavy robes, and I will throw this light wrapper around you,&#xD;
and then you can lie down again-there!&#xD;
"Oh! sleep !-when shall I sleep again V' bitterly asked&#xD;
Carolyn, as Zuleime laid her head tenderly back upon the&#xD;
freshened pillow.&#xD;
"Well, don't talk, dear Carolyn, and you will see that&#xD;
God will send sleep." And Zuleime cooled her brow by&#xD;
passing over it several times a lump of ice in a napkin, and&#xD;
laid down by her side, and fanned her, in that measured,&#xD;
monotonous time, so inducive to slumber. So slowly ~he&#xD;
fanned her, 'resistin~7dl her attempts to enter into conversa-&#xD;
tion, until wearied nature yielded, and Carolyn was asleep.&#xD;
Then, as it was morning, Zuleime hoisted the windows, to&#xD;
admit a fresh current of air, but left the blinds clos ~d, to&#xD;
exclude the light. ~4ext, she put all Carolyn's things sam-&#xD;
fully away, and silently restored the room to order. Then&#xD;
she laid a folded napkin, dipped in ice-water, over the still&#xD;
burning brow, and cautiously left the room, to go and order&#xD;
tea and toast to be ready for Carolyn as soon as she, should&#xD;
awake. She found the house below stairs in a great but&#xD;
comparatively sien~t bustle. The servants, who had scarcely&#xD;
retired the night previous, wete engaged in clearing away&#xD;

the disorder of the saloon, parlor and dining-room, and in&#xD;
laying the cloth for breakfast for the numerous visitors who&#xD;
had remained over night. Zuleime passed on to the kitchen,&#xD;
and gave her orders, and then silently stole up stairs again&#xD;
to her sister's room~&#xD;
Carolyn slept long and heavily. Several hours passed&#xD;
before she awoke. When she opened her eyes, arid fixed&#xD;
them gratefully upon Zuleime, she raised her arms, again&#xD;
embraced her, saying-.&#xD;
"You have comforted me, dear Zi~zleime."&#xD;
"And I will comfort you more, dear sister. I know how&#xD;
to. doit. how do you feel, Carolyn ~"&#xD;
"Better-my head clearer-my nerves steadier-but a&#xD;
weary weight at my heart."&#xD;
"It shall go away, Carolyn. I know how to drive it away.&#xD;
But first you must take something."&#xD;
And Zuleime rang the bell, and told the servant who zip-&#xD;
peared, to bxing Miss Carolyn some fresh tca~ and toast.&#xD;
While he was gone after it, Zuleime bathed her sister's&#xD;
face and hands, and combed out her hair, and by the time&#xD;
she was made comfortable, the servant r&#xD;

"I cannot appear this morning, Zuleime! I am tired of&#xD;
acting a p~rt !"&#xD;
"You need not do it, dear Carolyn! The people have&#xD;
breakfasted, and are almost all gone-and the others are&#xD;
going. Carolyn, dear, I saw drcherwhen he went away-"&#xD;
Miss Clifton was still too proud to make a comment.&#xD;
"Carolyn, he looked broken-hearted, despairing-indeed&#xD;
he did! Ol~, Carolyn! I think if he could have hoped that&#xD;
you. would have made up with him, he would have let his&#xD;
regiment go to perdition rather than not hastened to your~&#xD;
feet!"&#xD;
"Why did he not try, then ?"&#xD;
"Oh, sister, you banished him, and men have some pride.&#xD;
He waited for your relenting, feel sure !"&#xD;
Carolyn remembered, with bitter regret, her refusal ~o let&#xD;
.h~r father go and really him.&#xD;

"Carolyn, write to him. The detachment under his coin-&#xD;
niand does not march from Winchester for nine days yet.&#xD;
Write, Carolyn-there is abundant time for him to get your&#xD;
letter and answer it before he goes. Then you will be re-&#xD;
conciled and happy. Everything will be restored, and you&#xD;
will comfort yourself by remembering that he would have had&#xD;
to have gone, any way, and that he is gone reconciled !"&#xD;
Miss Clifton shook her head.&#xD;
"No, Zuleime! I cannot!' I should not know how to&#xD;
write such a letter! What could I say to blin ~"&#xD;
"Say! I should know what to say! If you have banished&#xD;
him, revoke your sentence of exile. If you have ascertained&#xD;
that you have done him injustice, tell him so. If you are&#xD;
sorry that you parted in anger, let him know it. If you wish&#xD;
to hear from him before he goes, ask him to write to you.~~&#xD;
"I could not !-I could not! I never could write such a&#xD;
letter! My heart-stringS would crack in the attempt !"&#xD;
"And are y~u so proud ~ And will you let kim go forth&#xD;
to that ghastly Indian war-oh, God my flesh creeps only&#xD;
to think of it !" said Zuleime, shuddering. "And will you&#xD;
not retract your false accusation, and revoke your cruel sen-&#xD;
tence of banishment, and express kind feelings and kind&#xD;
wishes for him about to be exposed to such horrors '~"&#xD;
"I can't! I can't! I cannot! My heart~string5 would&#xD;
snap with the effort! I can bear sorrow, but not humiliation!&#xD;
I can die, but I cannot be humbled !"&#xD;
"You cannot be humbled by an act of justice, sister. That&#xD;
letter would be only an act of justice. And, oh! it would&#xD;
give him such happiness, and bring you such sweet peace, in&#xD;
place of all this heartburning. Think of it, dear Carolyn !"&#xD;
While Zuleime spoke, a rap was heard at the door, and a&#xD;
servant appeared, and said that "Marster wished to see Miss&#xD;
Zuleime in the parlor."&#xD;
"Think of it, dear Carolyn," said Zuleime, in a cheerful&#xD;
voice, kissing her sister's forehead, and then hastening out&#xD;
of the room.&#xD;
Carolyn did think of it! The idea once presented, she&#xD;
could not banish it again ;-the hope of a reconciliation once&#xD;
raised, could ~not be suppressed! She could think of no-&#xD;
thing else. "It was but an act of conunon ju5ti0~-it was a&#xD;

grimly in her determination to protect that gentle, loving&#xD;
missive of sorrow and affection from an assault of her beset-&#xD;

her dressing.-gown, and stole down the back stairs, where she&#xD;
found a boy lounging. She ordered him to saddle~a horse&#xD;
immediately, and take that letter to the post office. Nay,&#xD;
she waited till she saw the boy off, and was sure that none&#xD;
had seen him or the letter he carried. Then she returned&#xD;
to her own room, determining that no soul.-.not her father..-..&#xD;
not even Zuleime, should share her confidence and know her&#xD;

lie was sitting in an easy-chair, doing u~thing, but appa-&#xD;

"Come hither, Zuleime," he said.&#xD;
And when she went up to him, he drew her upon his kuee,&#xD;
and passed his left arm around her waist, while, with his&#xD;
right hand, he smoothed her black hair.&#xD;
And lie gazed fondly in her face. He noticed that her&#xD;
cheek was pale, and her countenance pensive, but hoped that&#xD;
it was from the excitement of the night before. He could not&#xD;
bear to think of its being regret for Frank. He feared to ask&#xD;
her the cause of her seriousness. He disliked to recall Frank&#xD;
in any manner to her recollection. He wished her to forget&#xD;
him, if possible. At least, he would do so.&#xD;
"Zuleime," he said, after he had stroked her hair some&#xD;
time, "you know, my love, that your aunt Cabell, atid yo~ir&#xD;
cousins, are goix~ig back to Richmond to-day."&#xD;
"Are they, sir ~ I did not know it," said Zuleime,~ turn-&#xD;

coming.&#xD;
"Yes, my dear, they are. And, Zuleime-" here he&#xD;
paused-then he went on, "you have been thinking, I sup-&#xD;

upon your school duties again, as the first of September is&#xD;

"Thank you, my dear child. I am very glad to see you&#xD;
so prompt to oblige me; but, my dear Zuleime, I have good&#xD;
news for you."&#xD;
"Good news, sir ?"&#xD;
"Yes, girl! the best news! the very best news! news that&#xD;
young ladies always rejoice to hear !"&#xD;
"What news, sir ?" she asked, fearfully.&#xD;
"Don't whine, girl! it is not your sentence of death! It&#xD;
is your deed of emancipation! Your 'free papers,' as the&#xD;
niggers would say. You are not to return to school any&#xD;
more!&#xD;
now Are you noV surprised ~ Are you not rejoiced&#xD;
Zuleime was not. She was anxious, foreboding.&#xD;
"Why don't you speak, my dear ~ Ain't you glad you're&#xD;
not going back to school, to leather shoulder braces and hack&#xD;
boards, and square and compass rules and regulations, that&#xD;
mean nothing, unless they mean persecution and torture!&#xD;
Say, ain't you glad ~"&#xD;
"I think I ht~d rather go back to school for the present,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
"Nonsense, now, my dear! Ah! I see how it is! You&#xD;
want to return with your dear aunt Cabell, and the dear city&#xD;
cousins......especially cousin Charley! Eh, you monkey! You&#xD;
grow tired of the country and your old father, as soon as&#xD;
ever your aunt and cousins talk about returning to the cit4~y!&#xD;
Ah! you rogue," said the old man, chucking her under the&#xD;
chin, and devoutly praying that he might be right in his eon-&#xD;
jecture......for, oh! that child's happiness! It lay nearer his&#xD;
heart than anything else on earth or in heaven.&#xD;
"Dear father !" she said, embracing him, "I do not wish&#xD;
to leave you, indeed I do not. I prefer the country. And&#xD;
I had~ rather never leave you, or my home."&#xD;
"Dear little rogue, now don't tell. me that! I know better,&#xD;
you know! And it is quite natural, and nobody blames you!&#xD;
The young bird must leave its nest, and the young girl her&#xD;
home, when she l~ecomes a wife. Your mother left her pa-&#xD;
rents and came home here with her husband. So do not&#xD;
*tluiink, my love, that your old father will charge you with&#xD;
selfishness for wishing to leave him.-no, not wishing to leave&#xD;
him, but wishing to go with one who is to be youi4 hus-&#xD;
band."&#xD;
&#xD;
~uleiIDe dropped her head, to conceal the deadly pallor&#xD;
that crept over her face.&#xD;
"Yes, dear Zuleime, you will soon return to Richmond,&#xD;
though it will be not as a school~girlbut as a happy bride-&#xD;
as Mrs. Major Cabell! What a sonorous name and title for&#xD;
my little, romping Zuleime! Here, Charley Cabell! I have&#xD;
broken the ice, now come and speak)for yourself!" exclaimed&#xD;
Mr. Clifton to Major Cabell, who was going by the door.&#xD;
1'rlajor Cabell came in, passing the old geutleman~ who had&#xD;
seized his hat, and not trusting himself to look at his daugh-&#xD;
ter, rushed out of the room. Zuleime remained standing&#xD;
where he had placed her, when he put her off his knee-&#xD;
panic struck~5tUpiduntil Major Cabell took her hand,&#xD;
and attempted to lead her to a seat, then snatching her hand&#xD;
away with a shudder, she asked almost wildly-&#xD;
"Cousin Charles, when does father want this marriage to&#xD;
come off~"&#xD;
"As soon as my dearest Zuleilne will consent to make me&#xD;
the happiest of men !" replied the commolvPlace wooer, at-&#xD;
tempting to re-capture her hand, but she retreated shudder-&#xD;
ing, and asking, in a frantic tone and manner, in great con~&#xD;
trast to her calm words-&#xD;
"Cousin Charles, do me a favor! Do not press this mat-&#xD;
ter for a week or so."&#xD;
"Heaven forbid that I should hurry a lady, though that&#xD;
lady be my own little cousin and betrothed-Only fix the day&#xD;
and I will rest content-SO that it is not a far distant day,"&#xD;
he said, re~capturiflg her hand, throwing his arm around her&#xD;
waist, and drawing her towards him.&#xD;
"Please, don't! Let me go, cousin Charles!" exclaimed&#xD;
the girl, in great distress, struggling to free herself.&#xD;
"'Please, don't let me go, cousin Charles!' I don't in-&#xD;
tend to, pretty cousin, until you tell me when you will give&#xD;
yourself to me !" replied Major Cabell, kissing her all the&#xD;
more heartily because she strove to escape.&#xD;
"You know what I meant! Let me alone! It is un-&#xD;
manly to behave so! Don't make me hate you !" was on&#xD;
her quivering lips and in her flashing eyes, as by a sudden&#xD;
effort she threw his arms off and sat down; but then she re-&#xD;

to possess over him, and she choked 'down the indignant&#xD;
words, and said instead-&#xD;
"Please, don't hurry and worry me, cousin Charles&#xD;
this is so very sudden! I am sure I never dreamed you&#xD;
would ask for poor me for years to come yet. Ii am so&#xD;
young."&#xD;
So young!' Ah, Zuleime, that is a piece of pretty little&#xD;
womanish hypocrisy.-a little finesse that belongs to your&#xD;
character, and is inherited from your French mother! 'So&#xD;
young!' Now, my pretty childish cousin, you know you&#xD;
have received an offer of marriage this very week! And&#xD;
that, indeed, has accelerated my proposal. Fair Zuleime, a&#xD;
man does not care to see his young betrothed bride courted&#xD;
by another !"&#xD;
"I know that!" replied Zuleinie, in a peculiarly sad voice,&#xD;
moving to the other end of the room.&#xD;
The slightest gesture of avoidance of him by the girl,&#xD;
seemed to act as a provocative on him, so he followed her,&#xD;
and clasped her in his arms, and laughing, almost rudely&#xD;
kissed her, begging her between the kisses not to set his&#xD;
heart on fire by her charming prudery and petulance, but to&#xD;
fix the day, like a good, sensible girl as she was. Almost&#xD;
frantic with rago. and shame at being so freely handled, the&#xD;
Clifton blood rushed to her brain, and forgetting her father's&#xD;
interest and everything else, she dashed her hand violently&#xD;
into his face, and before 'he recovered from his astonishment,&#xD;
broke from him and escaped-her heart beating with one&#xD;
thought-one sudden, joyous thought-that come what might,&#xD;
she never could be either forced or persuaded' into a marriage&#xD;
with Major Cabell, because she was already a wedded wife-&#xD;
no set of circumstances, whatever, could make it her duty,&#xD;
or make it even possible for her to marry Major Cabell. In&#xD;
all her sorrows, that was one blessed truth to sit down and&#xD;
rest upon. All her duty was flow due to her husband: And&#xD;
with a youthful wife's enthusiasm firing and strengthening&#xD;
her heart, she thought she should stand as upon a rock,&#xD;
secure against a sea of troubles. Poor child! she had yet&#xD;
to learn that no position founded on a fault is for a moment&#xD;
safe. Several things soon forced themselves upon her me-&#xD;
mory and grieved her heart ;-her father's unknown but&#xD;
certain danger, her own promise of secrecy in regard to her&#xD;

marriage, the necessity of giving some definite answer to&#xD;
Major Cabell, and the obligation pressing upon her to pre-&#xD;
vent, by all and any means, the highly improper and ex-&#xD;
tremely offensive demonstrations of passion from her suitor,&#xD;
She determined to write to Frank, tell him all that had&#xD;
occurred, and ask his advice and direction; and to do this it&#xD;
was necessary to gain time, and to give no false promise in&#xD;
the interim. Already was Zuleime beginning to taste the&#xD;
bitter fruits of her stolen marriage, and might have exclaimed,&#xD;
in the perplexity of h&amp;amp; distracted he~rt and brain-&#xD;
Oh, what a tangled web we weave,&#xD;
When first we venture to deceive.&#xD;
While Zuleime's heart was beating so fast with many emo-&#xD;
tions, her father sauntered into the parlor, where ho found&#xD;
Major Cabell caressing and soothing his afflicted face.&#xD;
"Well, Chancy, boy! How is it with you, eh ~ 'Could&#xD;
you win a hearing from my little girl, oh? Give her time,&#xD;
you know, eh ?" said the old gentleman, affecting a lightness&#xD;
of heart which he was very far from feeling.&#xD;
To his surprise, Major Cabell laughed heartily, still coax-&#xD;
ing his ill-used phiz.&#xD;
"What's the matter, Charley? What's amused you, oh 'i"&#xD;
"Your girl! By my soul, Governor, I shall end in falling&#xD;
seriously in love with that girl! I didn't fancy her much at&#xD;
first to tell you the truth! She was entirely too good humored&#xD;
-always laughing.. And I had a fancy for marrying a shrew,&#xD;
just for the spicy fun of taming one! The same instinct,&#xD;
Governor, that makes me like to spring upon the back of the&#xD;
most vicious horse I can find, and ride and lash and spur&#xD;
and fatigue the soul out of his body, until I break his back&#xD;
or his temper, one-oh, Governor ?"&#xD;
The old man's florid cheeks became pale with rage, and ho&#xD;
felt an impulse to kick the puppy out, but a terrible neces-&#xD;
sity tied his tongue and hands, and Charles Cabell went on&#xD;
laughing and talking to this eWect&#xD;
"Now, then, having a fancy to marry and tame a shrew-.&#xD;
a real live, vicious, beautiful vixen-I did not want the&#xD;
spiciest part of the sport taken out of my hauds by fathers&#xD;
and mothers and pastors and masters. I shouldn't have&#xD;

much educated-too good humored, too polite, too docile,&#xD;
too much of the young 'lady,' too little of the wild young&#xD;
animal-and fiat and insipid in consequence; so I cared very&#xD;
little about her. But, ha, ha, ha! I never was more mis-&#xD;

Never mind! let the little tigress look out for the next .time&#xD;

The old man's bosom was tlled to bursting with suppressed&#xD;
passion, but he answered, calmly-.&#xD;
"Oh! she's young-she's young, a spoiled child-a spoiled&#xD;
child; be patient with her-she means well-give her time-&#xD;
be patient with her."&#xD;
"'Patient with her !' Why, uncle, I wouldn't have her&#xD;

his' riding-whip and cracking it against his boots, he went&#xD;
out.&#xD;
The old man boiled over-he clenched his teeth, and&#xD;
shook his fist-nay, shook his whole person, as he turned&#xD;

livid with rage; then his arms fell helplessly by his side-&#xD;
he sank into a chair-dropped his face upon his hands, and&#xD;
groaned aloud. He felt a pair of arms encircling his neck1&#xD;
and a sweet voice murmuring in his ear-and he raised his&#xD;
head to see Zuleitne, and to hear her ask in loving tones-&#xD;
"Father, what is it ~"&#xD;
He put his hand tenderly around her waist, and drew her&#xD;
gently to his knee, and said, while he gazed remorsefully&#xD;
into her face-&#xD;
"1 am a villain, Zuleime! A hoary-headed villain !"&#xD;
Zuleime placed her hand upon his mouth to stop the dread-&#xD;
ful words, and pressed her lips to his brow, with a look and&#xD;
manner of the profoundest love and veneration.&#xD;
"Yes, a hardened, persevering sinner, Zuleime! For I&#xD;
intend~to persevere! I intend to give you to Charley Cabell,&#xD;
my child," he said, gently removing her hand, and still&#xD;
gazing on her. He continued-" II love you so much, Zn-&#xD;
lejine! I love you so much! But, dear child. He's coming!&#xD;
Dear child, tell me when you Will marry Charley~~Tuesday&#xD;
three weeks or four weeks ~ Don't let it be longer than four&#xD;
weeks, my girl !"&#xD;
"Father! will you tell me why you wish me to marry&#xD;
cousin Charles ~"&#xD;
"I cannot! I cannot! My child, I cannot. It is for&#xD;
your good, I hope! Some day I will, perhaps. Tell me&#xD;
now, that's a good girl. What day will you give this little&#xD;
hand to cousin Charley V'&#xD;

indeed, father, I cannot!"&#xD;
"Come, now, nonsense, my child; why can't you ~ Here&#xD;

"I cannot, father ~&#xD;
The old gentleman kissed, and coaxed, and almost wept;&#xD;
a manner of attack so hard to be resisted, that had Zuleune&#xD;
been really free, she would have sacrificed her own and&#xD;
Frank's hopes, and yield~d. But Zuleime was not free, and&#xD;
therefore was as firmly proof against persuasion, as she would&#xD;
have been against force. Two powerful motives operated in&#xD;
preventing her from confessing her marriage-first her pro-&#xD;
mise to keep it secret, and then the fear of precipitating&#xD;
some violent, scene between her father and cousin, or some&#xD;

joy or sorrow, they must alike suddenly give way. Towards&#xD;

Oblivious of pride and caution, careless of exposing herself&#xD;
to the malign sneers of Georgia, or the rude comments of the&#xD;
servants, she sat in the piazza, watching the road by which&#xD;
the carriage should corne-one wild, anxious, repairing hope&#xD;
possessing her. "The drowning catch it straws "-and she;&#xD;
in her despair, had clutched qne mad possibility, and clun~g&#xD;
to it, until to her weakened, confused, insane soul, it seemed&#xD;
a probability, and then almost a certainty. It was the hope&#xD;
that Clifton might return with her father! Oh, yes! That&#xD;
Clifton might resign his commission and come back to her.&#xD;
Oh! if indeed he loved her, as he had a thousand times&#xD;
sworn, if he sorrowed over their estrangement only half as&#xD;
much as she did, no hope of ~lory, no fear of disgrace would&#xD;
keep him back. The more she brooded over- this, the more&#xD;
likely, the more certain it appeared to be. And she sat and&#xD;
gazed up the dim forest road.&#xD;
The sun sank to the edge of the horizon, and lit up all the&#xD;
mounttiin tops with fire, and then went down. And when&#xD;
she could no longer see, she still sat and strained her ear to&#xD;
catch the di~tant~ sound of wheels.&#xD;
The moon arose, and flooded all the mountain scenery with&#xD;
silver light, and flashed upon that distant bend of the river,&#xD;
until it seemed a silver lake, lying among %~he dark hills, and&#xD;
pointed the peaks of White Cliffs, until they stood up and&#xD;
glittered, like an enormous row, of spears, against the deep&#xD;
blue sky.&#xD;
At last,, at last the very distant sound of wheels came&#xD;
faintly like a doubt to her ear, and faded away again. Then&#xD;
it came more distinctly, nearer, and a moving object ap-&#xD;
peared upon the road. And she knew indeed it ~was her&#xD;

father~ carriage. She saw and recognized it in the moon-&#xD;
light.' It turned into the lawn gate, rolled rapidly around&#xD;
the circular drive, and swept swiftly up to the entrance,&#xD;
where it stopped. The steps were let down, the door opened,&#xD;
and old Mr. Clifton got out, followed by-no one.&#xD;
Carolyn had bent eagerly, unconsciously forward; now she&#xD;
started up and caught her father's hand, and gazed silently,&#xD;
imploringly into his face, for the news she could not ask&#xD;
for.&#xD;
"The detachment has marched, my dear child! Marched&#xD;
the morning of the day upon which I reached Winchester~&#xD;
and two days before it was expected to have gone. So, you&#xD;
see, I could not get a sight of either Frank or Archer. They&#xD;
were thirty miles on their road before I reached the city.&#xD;
Can't think what could have been the reason of the new&#xD;
order, to anticipate their departure by two days. However!&#xD;
cheer up! No use fretting, my dear! No use fretting! The&#xD;
family have supped long ago, of course-have they kept my&#xD;
supper ~hot for me ~ I am as hungry as an old wolf," said&#xD;
the old man.&#xD;
Carolyn did not hear him. Her hold relaxed upon his arm,&#xD;
her hands flew up to her head, and she turned, asne struck&#xD;
with sudden blindness, and tottered into the house. It was&#xD;
so dark in the shady piazza, screened from the moonbeams&#xD;
by interlacing cypress vines, that the old man did not see her&#xD;
state. He hastened into the house, where another awaited&#xD;
him with equal anxiety&#xD;
Zuleime's private hope had been that Frank would seize&#xD;
the opportunity of Mr. Clifton's visit, and confess his mar-&#xD;
riage, and invent some way of delivering her father from the&#xD;
toils of Major Cabell.&#xD;
"What news, father ~" she asked, meeting him in the hall.&#xD;
"'What news V Why, I am as hungry as a bear, my&#xD;
pet! That's the news! I stopped to supper at L-.&#xD;
But, my life! They like to have poisoned me with fried&#xD;
beefsteaks and heavy biscuits and green coffee. Couldn't&#xD;
touch a morsel, child! And now I am starved up to a savage&#xD;
pitch! What have you got for supper V'&#xD;
"Turtle soup and old crusted port, among other things,&#xD;
father," replied Zuleime, waving her own anxiety for the sake&#xD;
of satisfying him.&#xD;

"TURTLE soup! And OLD CRUSTED PORT ;" exclaimed&#xD;
the old man, in an ecstasy of delight. "Why, where on earth&#xD;
did they come from ?"&#xD;
"The turtle came from a ship at Norfolk, and was sent&#xD;
hither by Major Cabell, who added a dozen of port of his&#xD;
own importation," said Zuleime, dying with. anxiety to hear&#xD;
from Frank.&#xD;
"Ah-h-h-h! That was kind! He's a fellow! He'll make&#xD;
a magnificent husband and son-in-law, Zuleime! I hope you&#xD;
know how turtle soup should be made ?"&#xD;
"Father, I know it should be eaten quite hot, and it is on&#xD;
the table by this time. Come in.,~&#xD;
The old man needed no pressing, but went into the dining-&#xD;
room, and sat down at the table, with a face radiant with de-&#xD;
light. Zuleime waited on him, although there was a servant&#xD;
in attendance. And when he had freely partaken of turtle&#xD;
soup, devilled crabs, a roasted fowl, etc., washed them down&#xD;
with port wine, she brought him a cup of fragrant Mocha&#xD;
coffee and his case of cigars. , And he sipped the coffee with&#xD;
an air of infinite leisure, and then lit a cigar and puffed slowly&#xD;
away, as if eternity was before him.&#xD;
"Fath~', what news from Winchester ?" again asked Zn-&#xD;
leime, though her hopes had fallen very low. "Whet news,&#xD;
dear father ?"&#xD;
"What's that to you, my pet? Will you let me digest&#xD;
my supper in peace ?"&#xD;
Zuleinae sat down, but looked so anxious, that her very&#xD;
looks worried the old gentleman, and he said-&#xD;
"Don't you know, girl, that indigestion is very dangerous&#xD;
to a man of my time of life? I't may bring on apoplexy!&#xD;
Don't worry me !"&#xD;
Zuleime veiled her anxious gaze, but even then the pale-&#xD;
ness of her cheeks annoyed her father, and he testily in-&#xD;
quired.-.&#xD;
"Now, what is it to you? I can understand Carolyn's&#xD;
anxiety. I cannot comprehend yours at all! There, now.&#xD;
.Go and send my wife to me!"&#xD;
Zuleime arose to obey, but before she went, she threw her&#xD;
arms around his neck, and asked-&#xD;
"iDearest father, only tell me! Where our friends well?&#xD;
Have they gone? Did they send any message ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
173&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Only answer you three questionS at a time! That 15&#xD;
reasonable! However, Ii can answer all in one. I have not&#xD;
seen our friends. Their detatchiflentileft Winchester twelve&#xD;
hours before I reached there. And now I'll tell you what I&#xD;
did not like to tell Carolyn, poor girl! Namely, that the de-&#xD;
tachment marched two days earlier than was intended, upon&#xD;
account of dispatches received from Fort -~ praying for&#xD;
speedy succor in a reinforcement. The savages have been&#xD;
inassacreing and scalping there at. a most tremendous rate!&#xD;
It is really a very dangerous service, In4ian warfare! God&#xD;
grant that our young friends may return to us safe! Why&#xD;
don't you go along and tell Georgia to come to in~ ?"&#xD;
Zuleime kjg~~d her father, settled the cushion under his&#xD;
feet, and went on her errand. That dispatched, she sought&#xD;
her own chamber, and lay down to collect 'her thoughts. No&#xD;
letter or message from her husband, and her promise of&#xD;
secrecy in regard to her marriage, binding on her as ever.&#xD;
And next week she must ~ive an answer to her father for&#xD;
Major Cabell. She was confident that one of two things had&#xD;
happened. Either her letter had never reached Frank, or else&#xD;
his answer had been lost. And by the transaction only&#xD;
one week's respite had she gained for her fathev-for next&#xD;
week her refusal must be decided and final, and then-what&#xD;
might not the consequence be to him? These thoughts ex-&#xD;
cited her mind, and kept her awake. And despite her de-&#xD;
termination to sleep, and her efforts to do so, she heard every&#xD;
passing hour strike. It was soon after one ,o'clock that she&#xD;
had fallen into a fitful slumber, when ~he was awakened by&#xD;
the sound of a gay, high voice, intermingling merry words&#xD;
and joyous laughter. Indeed, there seemed to be not only&#xD;
one, but many voices, talking and laughing in the most jocund&#xD;
manner. And 5trange~~pa5sing strange!. it seemed to come&#xD;
from her sister's room, which adjoined hers! She listened&#xD;
awhile; the words became fewer, but the laughter grew&#xD;
wilder! And then it struck upon her' frightened senses that&#xD;
Carolyn was a maniac, talking, laughing to herself! Spring-&#xD;
ing from her bed, and without even waiting to slip on a gown,.&#xD;
she ran into the passage and knockiA at her sister's door,&#xD;
and attempted to push it open. It was locked- on the inside,.&#xD;
and all her efforts to force an entrance were vain, and all her&#xD;
entreaties for admission were answered by peals of uncon-&#xD;

scions laughter. At last she ran to her father's door, and&#xD;
rapped loudly, exclaiming-&#xD;
"Father, father! Get up! get up! Something, I am&#xD;
sure, has happened to Carolyn! Something dreadful! Get&#xD;
up! getup!"&#xD;
The old man was hard to awaken, even by the efforts of&#xD;
'Georgia, who was aroused at once, and came and opened the&#xD;
door for Zuleime! And all this time the sound of loud talk,&#xD;
high laughter, and wild snatches of song, as from several ex-&#xD;
cited people, rather than from ono, issued from Carolyn's&#xD;
chamber. At length, by the united exertions of his wife&#xD;
and daughter, the fatigued and drowsy old gentleman was&#xD;
aroused and placed upon his feet, and mad6 to&#xD;
"Un~Ierstand a horror in their words-&#xD;
If not the words."&#xD;
He threw on his shawl gown and hastened to Carolyn's&#xD;
'door, which was instantly forced open.&#xD;
And what a sight met their eyes!&#xD;
There stood Miss Clifton arrayed in her gorgeous bridal&#xD;
costume, looking gloriously beautiful, though certainly as no&#xD;
bride ever looked before! The raging fever had given the&#xD;
brightness and richness of the carnation rose to her com~&#xD;
plexion, and imparted a supernatural light to her eyes, that&#xD;
'burned and flashed, and seemed to strike fire as they sprang&#xD;
from one to the other of the intruders, with a mad, joyous,&#xD;
defiant glance!&#xD;
The alarm of her father was unlimited, unspeakable! He&#xD;
darted from the room, and almost precipitated himself down&#xD;
the stairs in his haste to mount and dispatch a servant for&#xD;
the family physician. And while he was gone, Georgia and&#xD;
Zuleime, by coaxing and humoring the phantasy of the poor&#xD;
girl, succeeded in undressing her and putting her to bed-&#xD;
she still raving about her marriage, and sometimes breaking&#xD;
out into a wild laugh, and once telling Georgia that 8ke,&#xD;
being a married woman, had no right or business to be offi-&#xD;
ciating as bridesmaid.&#xD;
It was near morning when the doctor came.' After exam-&#xD;
ining the state of the patient, he pronounced her disease to&#xD;
be brain fever, brought on by over-excitement of the nervous&#xD;
system. He wrote prescriptions, and remained with her until&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
they were administered. And then he departed with a&#xD;
promise to return early in the forenoon.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton, of llardbargaiii, was summoned, and lost no&#xD;
time in hastening to the sick room of her daughter-in-law,&#xD;
as she chose to call Carolyn.&#xD;
For many days the struggle between life and death went&#xD;
on, and no one, not even the medical attendant, was able to&#xD;
form an opinion as to which power would eventually conquer.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton had taken her station by the bedside of the&#xD;
patient as permanent nurse, and she constantly refused to&#xD;
yield her post to any other person. And it' was to her vigi-&#xD;
lant attention, quick perceptions, and intelligent treatment,&#xD;
that all the family. ascribed the recovery of the girl. For tho&#xD;
crisis came and passed, and Carolyn Clifton lived.&#xD;
But no sooner was the patient pronounced out of danger,&#xD;
and the excitement of anxiety over, than the. nurse herself&#xD;
fell ill. And Nrs. Clifton, exhausted, prostrated, entered&#xD;
her carriage, and was driven to Hardbargain.&#xD;

CHAPTER ~XIII.&#xD;
ARCHER CLIFTON'S SKETCHES.&#xD;
The deepest sorrow that stern fate can bring&#xD;
In all her catalogue of suffering,&#xD;
An eating rust-lhe spirit's direst pain-&#xD;
'to love, adore-nor be beloved again,&#xD;
Or know between you lies a gulf that ever&#xD;
Your forms, your hopes, your destinies must sever-.Mas. LEWIS,&#xD;
As soon as Mrs. Clifton reached home-leaning on the&#xD;
ann of her maid, she walked up stairs and.entered her son's&#xD;
deserted room, and when her attendant had relieved her of&#xD;
scarf and bonnet, she lay down upon his lounge, and sent&#xD;
Ilenny for Kate Kavanagh. In less than half an hour Kate&#xD;
entered. And the lady turned to her and said-&#xD;
"Catherine, my dear, I must take you into my confidence~&#xD;
yes, and into other people's, too, whether they approve it or&#xD;
not. Draw Archer's writing-desk up here to the side of the&#xD;
lounge. I want you to write a letter to him. Catherine's&#xD;
brow crimsoned, and ~he trembled very much as she obeyed.&#xD;
"My dear Cath~rine, I am sure you will be discreet, and&#xD;
never speak of what I am about to entrust to you. I can&#xD;
rely on you P' said the lady, interrogatively, raising those&#xD;
fever-brightened dark eyes to the girl's face. Catherine&#xD;
nodded quickl5r, in her usual way, when the words would not&#xD;
come. "You see, my dear child, this most unhappy ~quarrel&#xD;
between Carolyn and Ar6her, is causing a great deal of un-&#xD;
necessary suffering to both-aud Carolyn, as the frailer of&#xD;
the two, is nearly dying under it. Her brain fever was&#xD;
caused by it. And it was as much as Dr. Barnes and my-&#xD;
self could do, to bring her safely through it with life and&#xD;
reason. This estrangement between them must not continue,&#xD;
or she will die. She is not so strong as she looks to be.&#xD;
Indeed, she is very delicate, like her mother. Arche~ is far&#xD;
on his Western march now, and cannot return of course;.&#xD;

but he must write to her, and comfort her. I wish you to&#xD;
write and tell him so. Now, then, child, you know the ob-&#xD;
ject. Open the desk, and lay out the paper, while I try to&#xD;
think what I want said, and how I want you to say it."&#xD;
Catherine's hands quivered as she turned down the leaf of&#xD;
the desk, and mechanicallY laid the paper out on the top.&#xD;
"Just date it, dear child, and then I will tell you how to be-&#xD;
gin." Catherine dipped her pen in ink, and was just about&#xD;
to put it to paper; when something there caught and held her&#xD;
eyes,~ and she gazed with dilating pupils, and trembled more&#xD;
than ever.&#xD;
The paper before her was covered with a water-colored&#xD;
sketch of Marguerite, of France, at the siege of Damietta.&#xD;
And the ideal face of the royal heroine, was the real one of&#xD;
the humble Catherine herself. And in the corner of the&#xD;
paper were the initials A. C. He had taken her homely fea-&#xD;
tures as his notion of those of the heroic Queen of St. Louis.&#xD;
And as she gazed, her heart shuddered with a strange, wild&#xD;
emotion of blended wonder, joy and remorse. The nature&#xD;
of the maiden was becoming vaguely intelligible to herself.&#xD;
And Mrs. Clifton did not see her trance, but lay upon ~he&#xD;
sofa very weary, with her hands pressed upon her temples,&#xD;
trying to settle in what manner she should address her son&#xD;
upon this delicate subject. And Catherine forgot everything&#xD;
in the sketch before her, and the tumultuous, blissful, painful&#xD;
emotions it excited. An abyss was suddenly thrown open&#xD;
in the depths of her heart, whose existence was unsuspected&#xD;
till now. Sow was she sorry that the marriage between&#xD;
Archer Clifton and his cousin, was broken off-by mutual&#xD;
consent~ She tried very earnestly to feel sorry, for she b&amp;amp;&#xD;
lived it her duty to be so. She forced herself to remember&#xD;
Carolyn's illness, and Archer's own suffering, in consequence&#xD;
of the estrangement between them. But, oh! there lay that&#xD;
picture before her eyes, with her own plain face idealized,&#xD;
glorified up to a high, pure, divine beauty, such as it had&#xD;
never, even in her highest, holiest, most inspired moods, pos-&#xD;
sessed. And a voice from her profound heart whispered-&#xD;
"Oh, yes, and he could ma1~e me r*lly beautiful and glori-&#xD;
ous as his ideal there-for he could make me good, and glad,&#xD;
and great beyond whatever I could make myself-if he&#xD;
chose 1" She reproached her heart severely for its seduc-&#xD;

tive whisper. She offered up a silent prayer to God to for..&#xD;
give her, and save her soul from secret sin. She called her..&#xD;
self foolish, presumptuous, treacherous. But, oh! in spite&#xD;
of alL these, would sparkle up from the depths of her spirit,&#xD;
sprays of gladness, as if there had suddenly sprung within&#xD;
an everlasting fountain of joy. Yet again she blaixied her-&#xD;
self most bitterly. She repeated that despairing complaint&#xD;
or confession of David-.." The heart is deceitful above all&#xD;
things, and desperately wicked." She almost realized its&#xD;
truth. She silently cried to God to enter her heart, and ex-&#xD;
pel its secret sin.&#xD;
"Well, child! are you ready!" inquired Mrs. Clifton,&#xD;
withdrawing her hands from her temples, and looking towards&#xD;
the entranced girl. Kate did not hear or see, her soul and&#xD;
senses were absorbed in the subject before her. Yet she did&#xD;
not think or hope about the future. It was the present, the&#xD;
present that absorbed her heart, despite of will, resistance&#xD;
and conscience.&#xD;
"Kate! are you asleep or in a trance ?" asked the lady,&#xD;
gazing at her.&#xD;
The maiden started, and blushed deeply.&#xD;
"Catherine! what are you thinking of?" she repeated,&#xD;
fixing her dark eyes upon the girl, until they seemed to burn&#xD;
into her soul.&#xD;
Kate looked guilty and bewildered, recovering herself by&#xD;
an effort,, and answered, almost at random.-.&#xD;
"This is not letter paper, madam, it is Bristol board."&#xD;
"Oh, well! there is writing paper in the other department&#xD;
of the desk, my child, get it out."&#xD;
Kate examined the contents of the desk, and then re-&#xD;
plied-.-&#xD;
"There is no letter paper here, whatever, Mrs. Clifton."&#xD;
"What are those ?"&#xD;
"Only card boards and sketches, madam."&#xD;
ketcheses. That is just like Archer, to keep his sketches&#xD;
in his writing desk. his writing material will no doubt be&#xD;
found in his portfolio. But let me see those sketches, Cathe-&#xD;
rine; I have not seen lj~ni yet, and they will be something&#xD;
new to me-almost like a recent letter from Archer. I like&#xD;
to look over his drawings; they always mean something apart&#xD;
from their subject, as it seems to me. I often think his&#xD;

sketches form a running commentary, though an involuntary&#xD;
One, on his life and thoughts! Hand them to me, my child.'&#xD;
"These are only old historical ~subjects," said Kate, with&#xD;
visible reluctance to produce them.&#xD;
"Pass them over to me, my dear. If their subjects are as&#xD;
old as the Chinese History of the Creation, they will never-&#xD;
theless be eloquent to me of my son's present mood-of the&#xD;
state of his heart, and the progress or the retrogression of his&#xD;
ndnd. You cannot imagine, Catherine, the anxious curiosity&#xD;
of a mother to catch furtive glimpses of the interior of that&#xD;
heart she cannot always enter, and which is often hidden,&#xD;
too, from its possessor! 'We know not what manner of&#xD;
spirit we are of,' Catherine. For instance, do you know&#xD;
ypur own heart or mind? In all hearts lie depths below&#xD;
depths, never known to the owner until some earthquake of&#xD;
sorrow, or of passiOns throw them open to view! There are&#xD;
in all minds powers beyond powers of achievement or of en-&#xD;
durance, unsuspected by their possessor until some emergency&#xD;
calls them into action! But give me the drawings, Kate,&#xD;
they will refresh me like a talk with Archer."&#xD;
Catherine lifted them, en~ masse, and handed them to&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton, who took and examined each separately and&#xD;
leisurely.&#xD;
"Um-m-Tkie," she said, smiling gently, as she recognized&#xD;
their subjects :-"' Marguerite of France, at the Siege of&#xD;
Pamietta,' 'Joan of Arc, at Rhiems,' 'Margaret of Anjou,&#xD;
at St. Albans,' 'Last interview of Lord and Lady Russel,'&#xD;
and all these battle-axe heroines, wearing the likeness of my&#xD;
serious, domestic Catherine!* In truth, Archer has put you&#xD;
through as many characters and costumes as though he de-&#xD;
signed you for a tragic actress, in the heaviest line."&#xD;
Kate Kavanagh did not like that.&#xD;
"But two of these characters bear any affinity to you, my&#xD;
dear. I cannot fancy any similitude between the tender and&#xD;
fiery Marguerite~that 'falcon-hearted dove,' or her haughty&#xD;
and remorseless namesake of Anjon, and ~my grave, gentle&#xD;
Catherine. But the high and holy enthusiasm irradiating&#xD;
Joan's face, and the noble resignation of Lady Russel's&#xD;
countenance, suit your striking features very well. But I&#xD;
am talking like a mediocre~ stage critic. Captain Clifton has&#xD;
a very high opinion, Qf you, my Catherine. Pray try to&#xD;

merit it, my dear girl!" concluded the lady, with a little&#xD;
pardonable motherly ptidc.&#xD;
Kate Kavanagh looked down, and fingered the pens and&#xD;
wafers, for she felt the lady's eyes gazing through and through&#xD;
her-reading her very soul.&#xD;
"By-the-way, Catherine, 'have you seen Captain Clifton'5&#xD;
last work of art'!"&#xD;
"No, madam." (I wonder why she ealls him "Captain&#xD;
Clifton" to me-she never did so before, thought Kate.)&#xD;
"It is a highly finished miniature of Miss Clifton, painted&#xD;
on ivory. He had it set in a plain gold locket, and has&#xD;
taken it away with him. I saw him hang it around his neck,&#xD;
and lay it near his hearth"&#xD;
Catherine honestly believed that she was glad to hear this,&#xD;
for it seemed one wore stay to keep her thoughts right.&#xD;
"And' that, Catherine, is one reason among many others&#xD;
I have, for knowing his indestructible' love for Carolyn. And&#xD;
that is why I feel no hesitation in having this letter written,&#xD;
to end this foolish quarrel, and to restore peace to these two&#xD;
unha~5py young people," said Mrs. Clifton, looking, Catherine&#xD;
thought, very strangely at her-so strangely, that the&#xD;
maiden felt her cheeks burn with a vague sense of humiliation.&#xD;
She asked herself-....(Y~uld' Mrs. Clifton have read what had&#xD;
been passingin hoi~ mInd'! Well! if so-..-that was another&#xD;
band to bind her thoughts to the right.&#xD;
"LN~ow, then, to your task, my child. You will find paper&#xD;
in Captain Clifton's portf~Aio." She spoke gently as ever to&#xD;
Kate, but still called her son "Captain Clifton," as if to&#xD;
widen the distance between them.&#xD;
Kate felt troublQd at this, and then took herself to task for&#xD;
a state of minc~ so morbidly acute to impressions, that she&#xD;
noticed everything, even that trifle. She searched1and found&#xD;
the;writing materials in the portfolio, and went to work and&#xD;
wrote, from Mrs. Clifton's dictation, a letter, full of gentle&#xD;
rebuke, and kind, motherly counsel, to Ai~cher Clifton. And&#xD;
all to the end that he should write immediately, and recon-&#xD;
ciLe himself to Carolyn, who was extremely ill, and whom his&#xD;
mother fell assured, she said, that he must be most anxious&#xD;
to propitiate. The letter was sealed and dispatched, and&#xD;
the. l~dy, thoroughly worn out, and leaning upon the arm of&#xD;
Catherine, sought her own bed-ohamber,&#xD;

TIlE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
The next morning, Mrs. Clifton was so weary that she&#xD;
could only leave her bed-chamber to lie upon the sofa in the&#xD;
shady parlor, where she could be at hand to direct the opera-&#xD;
tions of her house servants-now engaged in cutting out and&#xD;
waking up the Fall clothing for the negroes. Catherine&#xD;
came early to assist in this onerous task. It was in the&#xD;
afternoon while the lady was still reclining on the sofa, aiid&#xD;
Catherine standing at a work-table basting a linsey~wool5ey&#xD;
frock~body-when a horse was heard to gallop up into the&#xD;
yard, a man to jump off and hasten up the steps of the piazza,&#xD;
and the instant, after, old Mr. Clifton entered~ the parlor,&#xD;
looking very much flurried and alarmed.&#xD;
"What is the matter'! I hope Carolyn is no worse&#xD;
asked the lady, anxious, yet calm.&#xD;
"No! Yes! A great deal better of course since the turn&#xD;
last night! Most malignant form of the disease, and grow-&#xD;
ing rapidly worse every hour. I tell yoz~ it is! The doctor&#xD;
affirms it !"&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton gazed at him in a sort of self~.posses5Cd per-&#xD;
plexity.&#xD;
"She has got the small-pox, madam."&#xD;
"The small-pox !"&#xD;
"Yes, madam, the confluent small-pox, in its worst form."&#xD;
"You astonish me! I trust-I believe you are mis-&#xD;
taken!"&#xD;
"No-I wish to Heaven I was! No, madam! Doctor's&#xD;
opinion !"&#xD;
"Why, how on eartl4. Sit down, Mr. Clifton! Kate, my&#xD;
dear, wheel that arm-chair around."&#xD;
Catherine obeyed, and the old gentleman sank among its&#xD;
* soft cushions, and took out his pocketA~andkerchief and wiped&#xD;
his face.&#xD;
"How on earth could she have got it'!" asked Mrs. Clifton.&#xD;
"Ah! Lord Almighty knows! Came spontaneously, I do&#xD;
suppose! You noticed those two pimples that appeared&#xD;
upon her forehead after the crisis of her fever passed'!"&#xD;
"Yes; but I thought nothing of them."&#xD;
"Nor did we at the time. But at any rate, that was the&#xD;
first appearance of the eruption"-little as we guessed it at the&#xD;
time. You see, she naturally began to grow better when&#xD;
this other disease began to break out, II suppose. Indeed, I&#xD;

have no doubt it was the coming of the sm~ill-pox, that ar-&#xD;
rested the fatal termination of the brain fever. Well, you&#xD;
see, last night after you had left her so much better, we en..&#xD;
trtzsted her to the care of Zuleime, who did not seem to be&#xD;
so much worn out with watching as the rest of us. So Zn.&#xD;
leime sat up with her; and she tells me that before midnight&#xD;
her face was sprinkled all over with those pimples. And&#xD;
this morning, when I first saw her-" The old man~s Voice&#xD;
broke down for a moment. "Oh ! it was dreadful! her&#xD;
beautiful, fair face, neck, bosom, arms, all covered Over with&#xD;
that horrible eruption It had all run together in one mass.&#xD;
We sent off to hasten the arrival of the doctor, who, when&#xD;
he came, pronounced the disease to be confluent small-pox.&#xD;
Oh, it is horrible! horrible, even if her life be spared! Dis"&#xD;
figured for life! What a fate for a woman! I drove Zuleime&#xD;
~out of the room against her will-for she, dear, generous&#xD;
girl, wished to stay and tend her sister. Georgia told me at&#xD;
breakfast, that she had just got a letter from her father, who&#xD;
was ill-and that she must have the carriage to-go to Rich-&#xD;
mond. She did not show me the letter, for she made haste&#xD;
and started almost immediately. Everything falls out disas-&#xD;

a nurse to that disease, for love or money, in this neighbor-&#xD;
hood. Advise me what to do. The necessity is so urgent!"&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton was now sitting up, supporting her he&#xD;
her hand, and essaying her strength.     ,    ad upon&#xD;
"I must go back, and nurse Carolyn myself."&#xD;
"You! Now, never suppose, my dear sister, that I have&#xD;
been hinting for you to return and finish killing yourself for&#xD;

I'll lock and bar the doors and windows, to keep you out,&#xD;

done. There is no one at home but Zuleime~and even if I&#xD;
were willing she should risk taking the - dreadful disease, she&#xD;
is so very young and inexperienced that I should be afraid to&#xD;
trust her sister's safety in her hands. ButI am* not willing&#xD;
that she should run any risk to herself~that's flat. But&#xD;
what's to be done ~"&#xD;
"There is not a servant on your plantation, or on this&#xD;

The lady maintained her purpose against Mr. Clifton's ve-&#xD;
hement opposition, and her calm persistence must have con~&#xD;
quered, but Kate Kavanagh mildly interposed, by saying- -&#xD;
"Let me go."&#xD;
"You! exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. Clifton, in a breath.&#xD;
"Yes; I am not a bad nurse. I have had considerable&#xD;
experience with sick people."&#xD;
~~But~yOu'Ve never had the small~pox~.~you're not the&#xD;

I,,&#xD;
"No, sir, I have never had that disease.&#xD;
"And you are willing to risk taking it V'&#xD;

"What! and you a young girl! Ain't you afraid of catch-&#xD;
ing it, and having your face spoiled V'&#xD;

you are willing to risk it, and ~fraid of catching it. - I do not&#xD;

~'Catherine is so simply truthful and straightforward !"&#xD;
said the lady, smiling; "she means that she is perfectly con-&#xD;

thinks it her duty to brave it, nevertheless! Is. not that it,&#xD;
my dear ~ IBut, Catherine, much as we thank you for your&#xD;
generous self-devotion, we must not permit you to think of&#xD;
going. I must do that, for I have had the disease. If you&#xD;
were to persist in your purpose, my' dear girl, you would&#xD;
almost certainly get the small-pox, and then your life, or at&#xD;
the very least, your beauty, would be sacrificed."&#xD;
"Beauty !".-If I had it and were to lose it, dear lady,'&#xD;
there is no' one to care for it !"&#xD;
"Yes, 1 should care for it, my Kate," said the lady, putting&#xD;
her arm around the girl's waist, and drawing her closer.&#xD;
"In fine, my good girl, you shall not go if you are afraid'&#xD;
That's certain !" said Mr. Clifton.&#xD;
"Oh, sir, that would not interfere with the faithful dis-&#xD;

"Excellent, sir! But indeed I do not like her exposing&#xD;
herself in my stead. I should not permit her to do it, indeed,&#xD;
if my power seconded my will," added the lady, sinking&#xD;
back fatigued upon her sofa cushions.&#xD;
Old Mr. Clifton was evidently inclined to accept Kate's&#xD;
services. Mrs~ Clifton was obliged to yield,-.....more to tho&#xD;
weakness that overpowered her frame than to the arguments&#xD;
set forth by Catherine. It was settled, then, that Kate&#xD;
should go. And she quickly put on her little straw bonnet&#xD;
and black silk scarf, and entered the gig that the old gentle-&#xD;
man borrowed from the lady to convey the girl to Clifton.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE mansion-house at White Cliffs was all but deserted.&#xD;
The very hou~e-serVant5, pretty mulatto girls, more afraid&#xD;
of destroying their good looks than losing their lives, had&#xD;
retreated to their own dens, feigning illness as an excuse to&#xD;
keep out of t'he reach of contagion. Catherine was intro-&#xD;
duced at once into the sick room. That sick room! What&#xD;
mind can conceive, or what pen should describe it. Only&#xD;
those who have nursed a patient through that worst form&#xD;
of the most loathsome pestilence, can realize its revolting&#xD;
horrors. To see any human being looking as the once beau-&#xD;
tiful Carolyn now looked. Her very features almost oblite-&#xD;
rated, while - fill up the pause, you who have seen the&#xD;
horrors of that pest. It was worse than any form of illness&#xD;
-it was worse than acath and decay. Disgust almost over-&#xD;
mastered pity, and Catherine turned away, shuddering with&#xD;
sickness of body and soul. Old Mr. Clifton cast one ago-&#xD;
nized look upon the ruin, and unable to bear the sight,&#xD;
rushed from the room. Catherine turned to her duty. The&#xD;
wretched patient was tossing about in high fever, and tearing&#xD;
her arms and bosom under the intolerable irritation. That&#xD;
work of destruction must be stopped first Catherine knew.&#xD;
Catherine caught her right hand, and it took all her strength&#xD;
to hold that hand, whose flesh seemed as it~ it would drop off,&#xD;

under the pressure, while she secured it to the bedstead.&#xD;
Then she captured the other dashing, tossing hand, and con~&#xD;
fined it in the same manner. And then she looked at the&#xD;
state of her own palms. Oh, offensive duty! No wonder,&#xD;
she thought, that the beautiful ~4eorgia had fled to Richmond,&#xD;
and the two pretty house-maids were extremely ill in their&#xD;
attic! Iliad she a wish to follow their example? No-for&#xD;
now all selfish fears were lost in deep compassion for the&#xD;
poor, forsaken wreck of beauty, that lay there at her mercy.&#xD;
She return~' to her duty. She administered to her patient&#xD;
an opiate, to soothe her restlessness. Took a sponge and&#xD;
tepid water, and thoroughly cleansed the surface of the skin,&#xD;
and anointed face, bosom and arms with a fragrant  emol-&#xD;
lient, to allay the intolerable itching. She then released her&#xD;
hands, and laid them easily upon the counterpane: Lastly,&#xD;
she ventilated and darkened the chamber, and took her seat&#xD;
by the bedside, to faii her patient while she slept. And deep&#xD;
was her satisfaction in watching that quiet, refreshing sleep.&#xD;
It is not my-intention to lead my reader through the dismal&#xD;
days that followed in that sick room, until the "secondary&#xD;
fever," the crisis of the disease, came and passed. Catherine&#xD;
nursed her patient tenderly, faithfully, night and day. Ca-&#xD;
rolyn's life was spared, but her peerless beauty was gone&#xD;
forever. Her luxuriant, fair hair was all lost, and her head&#xD;
was as bald and discolored as her face-and that!&#xD;
In that darkened chamber, and in the midst of physical&#xD;
suffering and weakness, Carolyn had had no Opportunity of&#xD;
ascertaining the extent of the ravages the disease had made&#xD;
in her beauty......if indeed she knew the nature of the former,&#xD;
or thought about the latter. But as she convalesced, and&#xD;
became able to sit up in bed and converse, she felt an in-&#xD;
valid's childish curiosity to look in the glass, and frequently&#xD;
requested her gentle nqrse to hand her one. But Catherine,&#xD;
dreading the effect of the shock, steadily refused to comply&#xD;
with her wishes in that respect, and perseveringly kept the&#xD;
room darkened. And the sick girl, too weak to persist long&#xD;
in any controversy, yielded the point.&#xD;
But one day, while Ga.therine was at her breakfast, and&#xD;
old iDarkey supplying her place by the bedside of the patient,&#xD;
Carolyn said in a tone that adn4tted of no denial, or bven&#xD;
delay..-~&#xD;
&#xD;
TILE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
187&#xD;
&#xD;
"IDarkey, ~1iand me that hand-glass from my dressing-&#xD;
table."&#xD;
And the old woman impulsively, thoughtlessly obeyed&#xD;
her, and brought it. Carolyn was propped up in bed. She&#xD;
took the mirror, gave one interested look into it-plucked&#xD;
off her little cap-gave another hurried glance-and utter-&#xD;
ing a long, low cry of despair, sunk back insensible upon&#xD;
her pillow.&#xD;
Old Darkey flew from the chair to ~ie patie an~d~ from&#xD;
the patient to the bell, in great trep~i ~ation~r1~Igiflg peals&#xD;
that brought all the household hurrying in alarm to the room.&#xD;
Old Mr. Clifton, being nearest at hand, arrived first. And&#xD;
when he saw and understood what had happened, he seized&#xD;
the hand-glass, and threw it out of the window, and laid hold&#xD;
of the heavy toilet mirror, and sent it flying 'after. Then he&#xD;
drove old iDarkey from the room, forbidding her, for a stupid&#xD;
and dangerous maniac, ever~ to show her face there again.&#xD;
And all this time, Catherine, who had entered so quietly that&#xD;
no one saw or heard her, was silently trying to restore the&#xD;
swooning girl. As Carolyn, with a deep sigh, opened her&#xD;
eyes, Kate motioned for every one to leave the chamber.&#xD;
And all noiselessly withdrew. Carolyn shivered and shud-&#xD;
dered several times, as she raised her eyes appealingly, des-&#xD;
pairingly to Catherine, who was bending tenderly over her.&#xD;
Catherine ~thought it best to answer that silent appeal by&#xD;
speaking at once to the point.&#xD;
"My dear Miss Clifton, you must not think that your face&#xD;
will continue to look anything like it does now, for it will&#xD;
not, indeed. For though it is very much discolored, it is not&#xD;
much pitted, and the discoloration will wear off in a few&#xD;
days. And as for your hair, Miss Clifton, that will grow out&#xD;
very soon, and be even more beautiful and luxuriant than be-&#xD;
fore, on account of the renewal of th kin-so, dear lady,&#xD;
take comfort and do not look in the g ass again until you are&#xD;
bettor." And all this time that Catherine stoke in this&#xD;
gentle manner, she was bathing the~girl's face and hands&#xD;
with bay water, and her tender touch was even more soothing&#xD;
than the sedative liquid. Catherine was almost impelled to&#xD;
say-" Have patience-bow to the will of God, and try to&#xD;
learn the lesson He inten~ to teach in this." But she felt&#xD;
the hour had not come for speaking such words. That she&#xD;

THE CURSE OF 0LIFToi~.&#xD;
&#xD;
herself must have patience and wait for the time when she&#xD;
might minister to her spiritual need.&#xD;
Up to this period, Miss Clifton did not know who her nurse&#xD;
was. Shc had heard her called "My dear child," or "My&#xD;
good girl," by the physician and by her flither, and they were&#xD;
the only visitors to the room, except old Darkey, who came to&#xD;
relieve the nurse at meal times, ai~d who simply called her&#xD;
"Miss." And if once or twice she had heard her called&#xD;
Catherine i ill she~ever imagined her to be Kate Kava-&#xD;
nagh, but some hire a endant. And, indeed, in the lan-&#xD;
guor of illness she thoftght nothing about it. A few days&#xD;
after this, however, when she had grown more composed and&#xD;
resigned, and while she lay watching Catherine's quiet move-&#xD;
nients through the room, she said-&#xD;
"My dear, good girl-my gentle nurse-tell me your&#xD;
name ~ I do pray sometimes, and I wish to know your name&#xD;
that I may ask God to bless you for exposing life and health&#xD;
and beauty for one whom mother, and sister, and servants'&#xD;
all deserted." Just now, for the first time, it flashed like&#xD;
lightning through Kate's mind that all the danger of infec-&#xD;
tion was over, and that she might now thank God for preserv-&#xD;
ing her from contagion. 'Yes ! ~she had forgotten herself for&#xD;
some time past, but now he~ -h~art leaped for joy and grati-&#xD;
tude, and she thanked God before she replied to Miss Clif-&#xD;
ton's question,. and said-.-&#xD;
"My name is Catherine Kavanagh."&#xD;
"So !-you are Kate Kavanagh! Hoist up the blind.&#xD;
Come to me. Let me look at you," said Miss Clifton, rais-&#xD;
ing on her elbow. Smiling, because unconscious of the&#xD;
hidden meaning in her words, Catherine approached and sat&#xD;
down by her bed. And Carolyn took both her hands, and&#xD;
"Fell to e perusing of her face,&#xD;
As thou,, she'd learn it off by heart."&#xD;
She pored over the' broad, square4orehead, looking strong,&#xD;
but not beautiful, for all the bright chestnut hair Was pushed&#xD;
carelessly aside-she gazed upon those dark gray eyes under&#xD;
their long black fringes-such deep, transparent wells of&#xD;
darkness and light they were.-she dwelt upon the' beautiful&#xD;
lips, and then her glance roved *er the symmetrical form.&#xD;
And she thought she had never seen so perfect a figure. And&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON. ~&#xD;
&#xD;
she sighed and raised her eyes again to the remarkable coun-.&#xD;
tenance, with its large features, pale and cadaverous now with&#xD;
a long season of confinement, fatigue and loss of sleep, and&#xD;
grave with thought, and earnest with deep feeling. And she&#xD;
could not settle it to her satisfaction whether Kate Kavanigh&#xD;
was a sublime beauty or a fright. Upon the whole, the girl&#xD;
interested and pained her. And she continued to hold her&#xD;
hands with a nervous grasp, and pore over her face and form&#xD;
as freely as though she had been only a ~eadfull scinating&#xD;
statue-while 1(ate blushed under the infliction, ~and finally&#xD;
drew her hands away and sat down. ~&#xD;
But every day Miss Clifton's confidence in, and esteem for&#xD;
Kate Kavanagh, increased. And every day Catherine sought&#xD;
to draw her. patient's soul to 'tl~e only true source of light,&#xD;
strength and consolation; and to sanctify this terrible afflic-&#xD;
tion to her spirit's good. The obligation to do this pressed&#xD;
upon the girl's conscience heavily, as if it were the hand of&#xD;
God. It was in vain that she said to herself, "I am nothing&#xD;
but a weak, erring girl. It would be presumption in me to&#xD;
speak. It might be received as impertinence, and do more&#xD;
harm than good." Still the answer arose from the depths of&#xD;
her heart, saying-" Speak the fitting words at the fitting&#xD;
time, as they arise within your mind, for they are the inspira-&#xD;
tion of God's spirit." And wisely, lovingly, reverently she&#xD;
spoke them as occasion called them forth. The right thing&#xD;
was always said at the moment it was needed. "Words&#xD;
spoken in season are like apples 'of gold on p1a~es of silver."&#xD;
Many a willing but bungling Christian would have failed to do&#xD;
Carolyn any good, for Miss Clifton was a very difficult subject.&#xD;
There is nothing so hard of impression as pride and scorn and&#xD;
jealousy. It was the dominion of that infernal triumvirate&#xD;
that made Lucifer an impracticable subject among the angels.&#xD;
But Catherine was moved and guided b~a higher power than&#xD;
herself. .Of herself she dared say nothing on Divine sub-&#xD;
jects. She only spoke #aen strongly, irresistibly impelled&#xD;
to do so. And her words were blessed to her patient and&#xD;
sanctified to her own spirit.&#xD;
Catherine had a powerful coadjutor in her good work. It&#xD;
was the sorrow in Carolyn's heart.' And ah, who could sound&#xD;

answered. And too often all is lost, or seems lost, before&#xD;
we consent to save ourselves. With Carolyn, all the trea-&#xD;
sures of her youth were gone,-health and beauty, love and&#xD;
hope. Something like this she breathed to Catherine, in a&#xD;
weak, despairing mood,-for only in a miserably depressed&#xD;
state of mind and body would the proud girl deign to com-&#xD;
plain.&#xD;
"Dear lady, do not say so sadly that 'allis lost~forever&#xD;
lost.' Dear lady, nothing is ever lost. It is~ impossible.&#xD;
The Lord, in His Divine Wisdom, may withdraw His gifts,&#xD;
but they are not lost-they have gone into His keeping."&#xD;
"I do not comprehend you! My poor good looks, such&#xD;
as they were, are surely gone forever. Nothing can restore&#xD;
their'! And oh, Catherine! you do not know-you cannot&#xD;
understand all the blessings, the hope, and the joy of my life&#xD;
fled forever! You are a child-yOii do not understand it !"&#xD;
"Perhaps I do not, lady, and perhaps III do! Seek all&#xD;
that you have lost in God! He has withdrawn His gifts,&#xD;
your treasures, that He may draw you to Himself! They&#xD;
are safe in His treasure house. If you have lost the beauty&#xD;
of the fair roseate complexion, He can endow you with a&#xD;
higher beauty, emanating from the sQul.. If you have lost&#xD;
human love, He can satisfy your soul with the richness and&#xD;
fullness of Divine love that never faileth! And for your&#xD;

"Oh! but it is the lost earthly hope, personal beauty and&#xD;

"And He can restore even those! 'But seek ye first the&#xD;

that saying. The days of miracles are not passed. Until&#xD;

stopped, fearing that she had said too much. And sh~&#xD;
silently prayed for a faith that should be as far removed froni&#xD;
presumption, as from despair.&#xD;
Carolyn convalesced very slowly. It was weeks before&#xD;
she left her bed. And then many more weeks before she left&#xD;
her room.&#xD;
It was a glorious day in Autumn, when she first walked&#xD;
out upon the lawn, supported between Catherine and her&#xD;
father. And as soon as she set foot upon the green sward,&#xD;
some cattle that were browsing there-..by some caprice to&#xD;
which cattle are subject~.~.started off as if seized by sudden&#xD;
panic, and ran huddling together confusedly, and. precipi-&#xD;
tating themselves towards the outer gate. And so weak Were&#xD;
the poor invalid's nerves, and so morbid her mind, that she&#xD;
burst into tears, and declared that gie very brutes fled from&#xD;
before her face, as from one less human than themselves!&#xD;
Nor could any argument- of Mr. Clifton's or of Catherine's,&#xD;
disabuse her mind of this absurd idea. She begged Cathe-&#xD;
rine to take her back to her chamber. And for many weeks&#xD;
no entreaties could induce her to leave it.&#xD;
Zuleune came freely to her sister now. She had her harp&#xD;
brought into her broom. And she soothed the recluse with&#xD;
music every day. And at last Kate Kavanagh, who had&#xD;
gradually merged from nurse into companion, added her own&#xD;
rich, full-toned voice in accompaniment. The Misses Clifton&#xD;
were both very much surprised to see -this" gift of gracious&#xD;
nature" thrown away upon a poor girl, with no hopes or&#xD;
prospects but manual labor for her living. And Zuleinie,&#xD;
who could be thoughtful and benevolent in the midst of&#xD;
'anxiety and sorrow, proposed to give Catherine lessons on the&#xD;
harp. But this was soon stopped. J*~th Zuleime and Cathe-&#xD;
rine perceived that the music, far from soothing, seemed to&#xD;
~irritate the invalid. And for this reason, Carolyn had lost&#xD;
her voice. She could never sing again. And even in speak-&#xD;
ing, her tones were harsh and rough. The harp was ban-&#xD;
ished, and books were brought. And while Zuleime worked,&#xD;
and Carolyn fondled a little King Charles, that had been&#xD;
bought for the childish invalid, Kate read aloud to the sis-&#xD;
ters. And now it was that the world of written poetry&#xD;
broke upon the maiden's delighted view. Before this, she&#xD;
had never read a line of poetry in her life, except hymns-&#xD;
&#xD;
for Mrs. Clifton had judiciously suppressed all books of that&#xD;
nature. But now the treasures of Milton, Goldsmith, and -&#xD;
Cowper, were opened to her ardent mind! Oh, those days&#xD;
that followed the convalescence of Miss Clifton-those even-&#xD;
ings after Carolyn had gone to rest, when she and Zuleime&#xD;
would go into the summer-saloon and spend the-hours in mu-&#xD;
sic or poetry, or in talk as musical, and as poetic. Those&#xD;
evenings, spent with a refined, warm-hearted girl like Zn-&#xD;
leime-theY were unfitting her for her prospective hard life&#xD;
of coarse labor and coarser association. She felt that it was&#xD;
so. And she determined to leave. She only waited until&#xD;
Mr. Clifton went to Richmond and brought back his wife.&#xD;
And then she bade them all good-bye and returned home-&#xD;
not to the farm-house of Jlardbargain, but to her bTother&#xD;
Carl's cabin.&#xD;
She needed to commune with herself, and be still. She&#xD;
wished to descend into the unsounded abysses of her heart,&#xD;
and examine, though with awe, the mystery of iniquity that&#xD;
in some unguarded hour had germinated there-this growing&#xD;
passion for a man betrothed to another. No matter if the&#xD;
marriage was broken off for the present. They loved each&#xD;
other. And that was the true betrothal. As for herself,~she&#xD;
would, with the grace of God, turn out this dangerous bosom&#xD;
guest, so divinely fair as td seem like an angel of light rather.&#xD;
than the tempting demon that it was! And to do this effectu-&#xD;
ally, she must break every tie that held her to that fair illu-&#xD;
sive life she had lately led. She must forsake every associa-&#xD;
tion connected with her sin and folly. 'She lov~d Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton-~loved her first for herself alone, and then as the&#xD;
mother of-one whose name she dared not now to breathe&#xD;
even to herself. She enjoyed the congenial society and oc-&#xD;
cupation~ at White Cliffs and at Rardbargain. And now she&#xD;
was the most welcome visitor on ~the list of both families.&#xD;
Thit she must forego the privilege this gave her. More 1~han&#xD;
all, she had enjoyed her -pleasant life at Hardbargaifl. ~he&#xD;
cheerful housekeeping cares she had shared with its mistress&#xD;
-the conversations over the pleasant tea-table or the social&#xD;
work-stand-the books, the newspapers, and the evening&#xD;
music, and the society of the admirable Mrs. Clifton-these&#xD;
formed the externals, the body of her happiness; but the&#xD;
interior, the soul of her joy, was that there was the home of&#xD;

white muslin dress for a fine crimson poplin one, and began&#xD;
to think of the pleasant autumn evenings, when all the family&#xD;
would gather around the hearth, with needle-work and books,&#xD;
and social chat. And, like a child, she was forgetting the&#xD;

but was expected back to tea. And there sat the tea-table,&#xD;
a little aside, to be clear of the chair, near the fire-place, and&#xD;
radiant with snowy damask and shining silver.&#xD;

and relieved her of the large shawl she had wdrn through the&#xD;
chilly passages, and closed her dressing-gown, and settled&#xD;
the lace border of the delicate little cap, and placed the&#xD;
softest cushion under her feet, and then kissed her forehead,&#xD;
but did not speak. Carolyn repaid her with a silent look of&#xD;
affection. Since the, departure of Catherine, Carolyn had&#xD;
sunk into a sort of mute despondency, in spite of all the care&#xD;
and affection of her sister, for it was her moral nature that&#xD;
needed help, and the young Zuleime could not&#xD;
"Minister to a mind diseased."&#xD;
Mrs. Georgia Clifton entered, and silently glided to her&#xD;
seat. Unconsciously, Georgia became a dark and terrible&#xD;
picture. She sat upon a low ottoman, at the corner of the&#xD;
fire-place, her head supported by her hand, and all her gut..&#xD;
tearing ringlets falling like a glory down each side of her&#xD;
darkly splendid face. And through that strong light and&#xD;
shadow her form palpitated, her bosom heaved and fell, her&#xD;
moist lips dropped apart, and her ey~ gleamed with a set,&#xD;
steady fire, as though some passionate trance wrapt and spell-&#xD;
bound her soul.&#xD;
Zuleime was moving about the room, and giving directions&#xD;
to a servant, who had brought in cakes and preserves. Finally&#xD;
she sat down, and took out her knitting-..-it was a pair of&#xD;
white lamb's wool socks, for her father-and knitted while&#xD;
she waited. She had not long to wait.&#xD;
The door swung open silently, and Mr. Clifton entered,&#xD;
with a newspaper in his hand, but looking so shocked and&#xD;
troubled, that all, with one accord, raised their eyes in silent&#xD;
inquiry.&#xD;
"Poor Frank! poor Frank 1" exclaimed the old man, as&#xD;
if he was ready to burst into a passion of tears.&#xD;
"What !-what of Frank'?" asked a faltering, gasping&#xD;
voice, which he could not recognize as belonging to either of&#xD;
the three young women present..-.yet answered, mechani-&#xD;
cally.-...&#xD;
"Those bloody Redskins! Those ghastly, horrible Sava-&#xD;

"There-there has been so me fighting! Is-----........~&#xD;

&#xD;
sallow and fierce, the eyes of Georgia gleamed the terror and&#xD;
anxiety she dared not express!&#xD;
"Archer is safe !" said Mr. Clifton.&#xD;
And the light of a sudden joy flitted across Georgia~s dark&#xD;
faee,-and Carolyn sank back, with a look of grateful relief.&#xD;
And no one noticed Zuleime. And no on&amp;amp; knew that she&#xD;
had spoken.&#xD;
"Yes! Archer is safe! Thank God! And a thousand&#xD;
times thank God, that Archer is safe! But Frank !-poor&#xD;
Frank! My God what a fate! Who shall tell his mother'?"&#xD;
"For Heaven's sake !-what has happened to Mr. Fair-&#xD;
fax'?" asked Georgia.&#xD;
"There! There! Read for yourself," replied the old&#xD;
man, getting up, and handing her the paper. He did not&#xD;
mean that she should read aloud, perhaps-but he forgot-&#xD;
he was confused with trouble.&#xD;
And she took the paper, and read :-~" FROM TIlE INDIAN&#xD;
FRONTIER HORRIBLE MASSACRE NEAR FORT&#xD;
PROTECTION.DisPatehes from our Western frontier&#xD;
bring the most painful account of a horrible massacre of a&#xD;
part of our troops by the Indians, in the vicinity of Fort&#xD;
Protection. On Monday, the 15th ultiino, a small recon-&#xD;
noitering party left the Fort, under the command of Lieu-&#xD;
tenant Fairfax. They had proceeded about a mile on their&#xD;
way, when they fell into an ambuscade of Indians, and were&#xD;
cut to pieces in the most shocking manner. The body of&#xD;
Lieutenant Fairfax, in particular, was so horribly mutilated&#xD;
as to be scarcely recognizable. The full particulars of the&#xD;
massacre, given below, are copied from the 'National Sen-&#xD;
tinel.' "&#xD;
Then followed a long account of the catastrophe, with&#xD;
every revolting circumstance detailed with horrid distinctness.&#xD;
The old man heard and groaned at intervals. Carolyn&#xD;
shuddered and wept by turns. And even Georgia's voice&#xD;
broke down for pity and horror. But she-the wife-the&#xD;
widow-she-the fearfully bereaved-she sat and listened to&#xD;
all the murderous story. She heard all-all. How he had&#xD;
been set upon by six or seven-.--hoW he had singly battled&#xD;
with them, when all his party. were lying dead around him-&#xD;
how then he tried to escape such fearful odds-how he was&#xD;

warm, beating heart was cloven through-.the fair hair torn&#xD;
from the bleeding skull-the fingers chopped off for the sake&#xD;
of the ring..- Frank wore but one-a simple gold ring, with&#xD;
a coral set, that she had taken from her slender fore finger,&#xD;
and contrived to squeeze past the joint, and get it comfortably&#xD;
upon his little finger. And they had cut it off in their haste&#xD;
to get it. How real that trifle made the whole horror, that&#xD;
might else have seemed like a nightmare! She sat and&#xD;
heard it all-all. And no motion, no tear, no cry escaped&#xD;
her.&#xD;
At last, when the reading was over, and they were re-&#xD;
leased from the spell of horror, old Mr. Clifton thought of&#xD;
Zuleime, and feared its effect on her. He turned to look at&#xD;
her. At first he saw nothing amiss.&#xD;
She eat so naturally, though still, with her knitting in her&#xD;
hands, as though only stopped for an instant, and her face&#xD;
turned in a listening attitude toward Georgia, who had ceased&#xD;
to read.&#xD;
* "It is all over-there is no more to hear, Zuleime, my&#xD;
darling," said the old man.&#xD;
But she did not move or speak. She seemed to look and&#xD;
~listen intently.&#xD;
"Zulejine," said her father gently.&#xD;
She remained perfectly still.&#xD;
"Zuleime !" he exclaimed, in a louder tone. She did not&#xD;
hear.&#xD;
..." ZULEIME! !" he cried, a third time, going towards her,&#xD;
to seize her shoulder.&#xD;
But he started back in aifright. They were all gazing at&#xD;
her now.&#xD;
"My God! she is DEAD ejaculatedted the father.&#xD;
"She is MAD !" exclaimed Georgia.&#xD;
They gathered around her. She knew it not. She sat&#xD;
there as if frozen into that attitude.-.-her face white and&#xD;
hard- -her lips bloodless and stiff, and her eyes still fixed&#xD;
towards the spot from which Georgia had been reading, but&#xD;
beyond it-beyond it-into the far distance, as if fascinated&#xD;
by some spectacle there of unutterable horror!&#xD;
"Zuleime! what are your looking at? Speak to me, my&#xD;
child !" cried her father, in great distress.&#xD;
'He might as well have expected a statue to speak.&#xD;
&#xD;

Carolyn took the knitting away, which, through all this,&#xD;
had dangled between her stiff, unconscious fingers. Georgia.&#xD;
rubbed her hands. Carolyn bathed her face. The old man&#xD;
cried to her-all in vain! They might as well have performed&#xD;
these offices for the dead.&#xD;
They lifted her up, and laid her on a sofa-her limbs&#xD;
hanging helplessly, like those of a dead or swooning girl.&#xD;
J3ut she was neither dead nor swooning. Wherever they&#xD;
moved her, her eyes were still fixed, in that bright, burning,&#xD;
horrible stare, upon the distance, as though the vision of the&#xD;
ghastly spectacle that had been conjured up before her&#xD;
imagination, followed her wherever she was turned.&#xD;
They took her up stairs, undressed and put her to bed.&#xD;
All night long she lay in th'e same state.&#xD;
In th~ morning there was no change, except that the&#xD;
muscles of the face had fallen, the cheeks sunken, the chin&#xD;
dropped, and that concentrated, intense gaze into vacancy,&#xD;
was more burning bright than ever. It was as though a&#xD;
burning soul was consuming the unconscious flesh to death.&#xD;
Or as if a body were turning to dust and ashes with the spirit&#xD;
still imprisoned in it.&#xD;
"She is sinking, and must die, unless she can be n~oved&#xD;
to tears," said the doctor.&#xD;
But what should move her to tears? Was there anything&#xD;
on earth that she could weep for now? Her old gray father&#xD;
had knelt, weeping, by her bedside, and torn his silver hair&#xD;
in anguish, without causing a single eyelash to quiver over&#xD;
that fixed, burning eye! What should make her weep?&#xD;
Plaintive music? She could not be made to hear it! The&#xD;
very songs that she and Frank had sung together? The&#xD;
sound was drowned in the groans from that scene of&#xD;
blood!&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton, of Ilardbargain, had come over, but though&#xD;
she was a woman of great skill and experience, all her efforts&#xD;
failed to rouse the girl from that fearful trance, which seemed&#xD;
likely to end in death.&#xD;
"Send for Catherine! If any one in the world can do&#xD;
her good now, it will be Catherine. There is, besides,'a&#xD;

Mrs. Clifton.&#xD;
"Ah! My Lord !-this is worse than any stupor! I&#xD;
wish to Heaven she would fall into a stupor," replied the&#xD;
father.&#xD;
"I know it! For her mind is not dulled, but seems&#xD;
wrought u~ to the highest pitch, and intent upon some im-&#xD;
Tb&#xD;
aginary vision of horror. She must be brought out of it.&#xD;
She must be subdued. Send for Catherine."&#xD;
Mr. Clifton went himself in the gig, to bring the kind&#xD;
girl.&#xD;
When Catherine arrived, and while she stood by the&#xD;
side of the stricken, insensible girl, Mr. Clifton said to&#xD;
her-.&#xD;
"You see, my dear child Zuleime seems to have been very&#xD;
much attached to this poor young man. And the news, of&#xD;
his horrid death was broken to her suddenly, and it has JnRt&#xD;
thrown her into this state! Look at her eyes! What do&#xD;
you think they see-in imagination, Ii mean ~?"&#xD;
"They see that scene of massacre-they see the death of&#xD;
her lover," said Kate, looking piteously at her friend-(for&#xD;
Zuleime wa~ her friend)-and brooding deeply Over some&#xD;
idea.&#xD;
"The doctor says she must die if she cannot be made to&#xD;
weep! Oh, Katey, my dear, dear girl! If you can only&#xD;
make her weep! I will give you-i was going to say-I&#xD;
would give you half of all I have in the world! Come, try!&#xD;
That's a good girl! You girls all know each other's little&#xD;
fool-secrets and love nonsenses. Come, try. Do you want&#xD;
to be left alone with her ~"&#xD;
Kate sh6ok her head in that quick way usual to her when&#xD;
strong feeling kept her silent-but she added-&#xD;
"Give me her keys."&#xD;
The old man seemed surprised, but looked about and dis-&#xD;
covered the required articles in her little work-basket, and&#xD;
handed them to Kate.&#xD;
"I only want to search and see if I cannot find some-&#xD;
thing that was his-some little token or keepsake, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
The old man took his station at the foot of the bedwhile&#xD;
Kate pursued her search. She knew what she was looking&#xD;

for, it was a curl of fair hair. She had caught a glimpse of&#xD;
it once-when Zuleime had opened a box in her drawer, and&#xD;
had immediately shut it again with a deep blush. And now&#xD;
she knew whose hair it was; and that the sight of it would&#xD;
bring tears to those burning eye-balls, and consciousness to&#xD;
that frenzied brain. She found it. She could have wept&#xD;
herself as she raised it from its little hiding place. She took&#xD;
it to the bedside-put her hand gently over those glaring&#xD;
eyes to darken them, and break the spell if possible, and&#xD;
then lifting her hand off again, she held up the lock of hair&#xD;
by the end, letting it drop into a fair shining ringlet before&#xD;
the eyes of the girl, as she said-&#xD;
"Zuleime, do you know whose hair this is V'&#xD;
The poor scathed eye-balls flied upon it-softened&#xD;
melted from their searching glare-a change came over her&#xD;
face-she extended her hand, and caught the tress as if fear-&#xD;
ing to lose it; and pressed it with both hands to her heart.&#xD;
Then her bosom began to heave convulsively, as with a great&#xD;
coming agony. Catherine caught her up, for she seemed&#xD;
about to suffocate. It was only the coming of the flood of&#xD;
tears-yes, the flood, for she fell upon Catherine's sustaining&#xD;
bosom, and sobbed and wept-such a deluge of tears, that&#xD;
the girl's dress was dripping wet, and it grew a wonder where&#xD;
so much came from. And Catherine's heart was smitten,&#xD;
and she wept, too-wept till she grew so weak she could&#xD;
scarcely sustain her burthen. And then old Mr. Clifton&#xD;
came around and relieved her, taking Zuleime into his arms&#xD;
and laying her head against his shoulder, saying-&#xD;
"There, cry! Cry on its father's neck, as much as it&#xD;
wants to! It shall cry its fill, poor thing! poor little heart-&#xD;
broken thing !"&#xD;
And she did, abundantly !-but pressed and kissed her&#xD;
father's neck the while for his tender words. This melted&#xD;
down the old man's heart so that he said-&#xD;
"They shan't plague you! None of them shall! Charley&#xD;
Cabell shan't come here to trouble you! That he shan't.&#xD;
Come what will; you shan't be forced to marry him! No,&#xD;

the heart and burst it! I will never try to stop a woman&#xD;
from crying again. Cry on, my poor little thing !" And so&#xD;
most ten~lerly, but half"childishly, the old man talked, and&#xD;
petted, and cooed over her.&#xD;
Catherine slipped down stairs to prepare tea and toast.&#xD;
When she came back, she found Zuleimelying back upon&#xD;
the pillow exhausted, but composed, and still pressing the&#xD;
little lock of hair. Catherine set dowi~ the little waiter, and&#xD;
took a bowl and napkin and washed her face with cologne&#xD;
and water, and then brought the cup of tea.&#xD;
Zuleitne shook her head mournfully.&#xD;
Catherine stooped and whispered.&#xD;
"For your father's sake, dear. Look at him."&#xD;
Zuleime raised her eyes to the old man's grief-worn, anxious&#xD;
face, and then extended her hand for the cup, and drank the&#xD;
tea.&#xD;
While Zuleime was resting in Catherine's arms and drink-&#xD;
ing the tea, a knock was heard at the door, and when Mr.&#xD;
Clifton opened it, a servant appeared and told him that Major&#xD;
Cabell had arrived, and wished to speak with him.&#xD;
And the old gentleman set his teeth, and immediately went&#xD;
below.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
MR. CLIFTON'S RESOLUTION.&#xD;
Full many a storm on this gray head has beat,&#xD;
And now on my high station do I stand,&#xD;
Like the tired watchman in rocked tower,&#xD;
Who looketh for the ho~ir of his release.&#xD;
I'm sick ofworldly broil, and fain would be&#xD;
With those who strive no more.-JoANNA BAILLut.&#xD;
"WELL, old two pence ha'penny, how d' y' do ~ Family&#xD;
all well at last, eh ?" said Major Cabell, advancing to meet&#xD;
Mr. Clifton, as he entered the parlor.&#xD;
The old gentleman extended his hand gravely, and wel~&#xD;
corned his visitor to White Cliffs. Then he rung the bell and&#xD;
ordered refreshments, but Major Cabell declined the latter,&#xD;
and inquired after the ladies.&#xD;
"My family are all in affliction! ID-n it, Charley, you&#xD;
know it! Curse that Indian war! ~y dear Carolyn scarcely&#xD;
recovered from the effects of that loathsome pestilence, be-&#xD;
fore here comes the news of that hideous massacre of poor&#xD;
Fairfax and his men, and just overwhelms my little Zu-&#xD;
leime !"&#xD;
"Zuleime ~ My dear little wife ~ I trust that nothing has&#xD;
been permitted to afflict her P'&#xD;
"The news of Fairfax's horrible death shocked her into&#xD;
a sort of appalled ecstacy, which lasted for twelve hours!&#xD;
And from which she was only roused to break into such tears&#xD;
and sobs, as I never heard before, and hope never to hear&#xD;
again.~~&#xD;
The old man wished to prepare Major Cabell, gradually, for&#xD;
the announcement he intended to make of the marriage about&#xD;
to be broken off. lie wished to touch his heart, to excite&#xD;
his sympathy, to awaken his generosity. He even hoped-&#xD;
for people will have wild hopes in extremity-that Major&#xD;

Cabell might anticipate his wish, and resign his claims, lie&#xD;
never was more mistaken in his life!&#xD;
Major Cabell listened in grave silence to his speech, and&#xD;
then in high displeasure, exclaimed~...&#xD;
"Bymy soul, sir! this is a very astonishing and most&#xD;
offensive thing, you. tell me! Why should Zuleime grieve&#xD;
thus immoderately over the death of this young officer. Will&#xD;
you explain that ?"&#xD;
"Yes! I might say-because he was her intimate con~..&#xD;
panion in her own home all the summt~r~and was soon after&#xD;
leaving it, so barbarously slaughtered. That is quite a soul-&#xD;
cient reason for the tender-hearted child to grieve excessively,&#xD;
But I will not deceive you, Major CabelL She loved this&#xD;
poor young man !"&#xD;
"Sir! Mr. Clifton! By Heaven, sir ~&#xD;
"It cannot be helped, Charley! Hearts cannot be bound&#xD;
by parchment and red tape! She loved this poor Frank&#xD;
Fairfax~and her heart is broken by his sudden, dreadful&#xD;
loss. Her grief, poor thing, must have its way! She shall&#xD;
not be troubled !"&#xD;
"And pray, sir," began Major Cabell, speaking with de-&#xD;
liberate scorn~~" how long shall this faithless girl be per-&#xD;
mitted to weep over the memory of that fellow, before she&#xD;
is required to give her hand to one who might have claimed&#xD;
it as his right long ago ?"&#xD;
"Charles Cabell," said the old man, speaking slowly and&#xD;
sadly, "is it possible that you can~that any man could wish&#xD;
to marry a broken-hearted girl, mourning over the grave of&#xD;
her freshly murdered lover !"&#xD;
"Wish to marry her? Wish to marry Zuleime? Give&#xD;
her to me! Give me Zuleime! Only give her to me, and&#xD;
then see! She is my right! I claim her by your promise-&#xD;
and I would take her now!"&#xD;
"But you are certainly mad! You would be miserable&#xD;
with her!"&#xD;
"Should I? That is my affair! Only give her to me!&#xD;
Come! let me have her to-day, or to-morrow, and I will take&#xD;
her home to Ri~hmond with me," said Major Cabell vehe-&#xD;
mently, almost fiercely.&#xD;
Old Mr. Clifton looked up at him in surprise, amounting&#xD;
almost to fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
205&#xD;
&#xD;
TH~ CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
Have I ever described Major Cabell to y~ii? lie was a&#xD;
small man, with clear cut, sharpened features, and pale face,&#xD;
surrounded by light brown hair and whiskers, with very&#xD;
handsome dark brown eyes, but with a certain latent ferocity&#xD;
in the eyes, and grimness about the thin, set lips. Somehow&#xD;
or other he irresistibly reminded you of a hyena~~eSPeciallY&#xD;
when he happened to laugh that thiiY, ungenial laugh.&#xD;
The old man looked at him in surprise, almost amounting&#xD;
to fear, and then he said-&#xD;
"But she does not love you now! She cannot love you&#xD;
yet! She loves Frank in his shroud better than any one left&#xD;
alive !"&#xD;
"I do not care! She must forget Frank, and love me!&#xD;
Women can be made to feel or feign anything, by one who&#xD;
understands them.~~&#xD;
"But her heart is breaking, I tell you !"&#xD;
"It must stop breaking, and nerve itself to life."&#xD;
"She is weeping her life away! She is a Niobe,~ I tell&#xD;
you! A living fountain of tears !"&#xD;
"She shall dry them and smile! See if I do not make&#xD;
her do it! Pooh! it is baby love, all this! IDo you think&#xD;
a girl of her age, can feel any lasting love, or grief, or en-&#xD;
during passion of any sorf at all? Pooh, pooh! I tell you&#xD;
if her lap-dog were killed, she would blubber and weep as&#xD;
much over its death, as she does over this other puppy's fate!&#xD;
But, once for all, Mr. Clifton, I tell you I do not intend to&#xD;
be put off, or in any way annoyed by this girl's grief and&#xD;
petulance. It is not well for you, her, or myself, that it&#xD;
should be indulged. Give her to me at once, according to&#xD;
your promise, and afterward I shall know how to deal with&#xD;
her-far better than you seem to know."&#xD;
"And you really wish to marry her in her present state,&#xD;
and take her home with you ?"&#xD;
"Yes! What ~objection? A wedding-party is not an in-&#xD;
dispensable accessory to the ceremony. A bridal journey&#xD;
from here to Richmond would be a very good substitute.&#xD;
Indeed, since the catastrophe of the last wedding-party&#xD;
at Clifton, I think the bridal journey would be in the best&#xD;
taste "4&#xD;
"Umph! And you would marry her so, and so take her&#xD;
away ?"&#xD;

"Certainly."&#xD;
"Brute I"&#xD;
"Sir'!"&#xD;
"BRUTE, I say! She would rather lie down with Frank&#xD;
in his bloody grave than marry you! And I would rather&#xD;
lay my child there-.-.ALrvE.......than give her to you! There!&#xD;
it is said! Now, I hope you understand me'!"&#xD;
Major Cabell brought his two. fierce brown eyes to bear&#xD;
upon Mr. Old Gentleman, and gazed as if he thought him&#xD;
bereft of his senses. Then he spoke in a peculiarly thin,&#xD;
smooth, distinct voice-.&#xD;
"Do you mean what you say, sir'!"&#xD;
"Yes I do! There !"&#xD;
" And have you duly considered this, sir'!"&#xD;
"Yes I have! There !"&#xD;
"And you know and are prepared to meet the conse-&#xD;
quences'!"&#xD;
"Yes! Do your worst! There !" said the old man, set-&#xD;
ting down his foot.&#xD;
Major Cabell arose and walked up arid down the floor in&#xD;
deep, perplexed thought. To say that he was surprised at&#xD;
this sudden, unexpected rebellion and daring on the part of&#xD;
Mr. Clifton would not be sufficient. He was just astounded,&#xD;
and could not surmise where the strength of the old man to&#xD;
oppose him, with his claims and his power, could come from!&#xD;
lie thought some external aid had been given! lie never&#xD;
guessed that it was the internal victory of conscience over&#xD;
cowardice.&#xD;
Old Mr. Clifton also arose and stretched himself, expand-&#xD;
ing his chest, and taking a long, deep breath of i~itense relief&#xD;
and satisfaction, saying-.-...&#xD;
"Thank Heaven, I feel better. Feel more like a man&#xD;
than I have felt for ten years. Now let the worst come, I&#xD;
can meet it !"&#xD;
Major Cabell glanced sideways at him, and continued his&#xD;
thoughtful pacing up and down the floor, lie was possessed&#xD;
with a sort of ferocious passion for Zuleime, a passion fanned&#xD;
to fury by opposition, lie was not one to bend his pride to&#xD;
sue. And yet he must have her! Soon, too!&#xD;
Old Mr. Clifton, now feeling and looking so mu4 better&#xD;
iind franker, and remembering that Major Cabell was his&#xD;

guest as well as his relative, went up to him and held out his&#xD;
hand, saying, heartily-&#xD;
"Chancy, give me your hand! I do not know what you&#xD;
are going to do, but III know that I am ready to meet what&#xD;
comes! In olden times mortal foes shook hands before they&#xD;
entered upon a deadly combat. In our times the executioner&#xD;
and his victim exchange courtesies. And the humanity of it&#xD;
is a touching comment upon the cruel necessities of our legal&#xD;
and social code. Let us not be more ungracious adversaries&#xD;
than they. Give me your hand. You are welcome to Clifton&#xD;
as long as you please to give us your company. Sport is&#xD;
good now on the mountains, and you can amuse yourself as&#xD;
you please.~,&#xD;
~vlajor Cabell paused in his walk, and placed his hand in&#xD;
the open palm of Mr. Clifton, saying-&#xD;
"I will take you at your word, sir! 1 will remain your&#xD;
guest for a few days. IL will hope that what you have said&#xD;
in regard to the marriage of myself and your daughter, has&#xD;
been spoken in haste, and under the influence of anger. I&#xD;
trust that you will review your words. To-day you speak from&#xD;
exeitement~~to~~morrow I hope that judgment will dictate&#xD;
your reply. You will remember that I, too, had something&#xD;
to complain of in the fact that my affianced bride, or one that&#xD;
I considered such, should have been so ill guided, or so illy&#xD;
guided 'herself, as to suffer her affections to fall into this en-&#xD;
tanglement. But we will say no more about it now, for I see&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton about to enter."&#xD;
Georgia entered indeed, smiling.&#xD;
Old Mr. Clifton seized the opportunity, and while Major&#xD;
Cabell was paying his devoirs to the beauty, excused him-&#xD;
self and left the room to go and see how Zuleime was getting&#xD;
on, and to reassure her if necessary.&#xD;
As soon as he had left the room, Georgia drew Major Ca-&#xD;
hell off to a distant sofa. And they sat down and entered&#xD;
upon a long, confidential conversation. And when it was&#xD;
ended, they arose and separated with looks of great satisfac-&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
~HE WIDOWED BRIDE.&#xD;
Her look composed, and steady eye,&#xD;
Despoke a matchless constancy,&#xD;
And there she sat, so ctdni and pale,&#xD;
Tbat but her breathing did not fail,&#xD;
And motion slight of eye and head,&#xD;
And of her bosom warranted&#xD;
That neither sense nor pulse she lacks,&#xD;
You might have thought a form of wax,&#xD;
Wrought to the very 'rife was there,&#xD;
So still she was, so pale, so fair.-Scovr.&#xD;
A FEW days after the incidents recorded in the last chap-&#xD;
ter, Mrs. Georgia Clifton entered Zuleime's room. The poor&#xD;
girl was sitting in an arm-Qhair near the window, idle, as was&#xD;
never her habit before, with her hands lying languidly one&#xD;
over the other and her eyes fixed upon vacancy.&#xD;
The beauty went to her with her soft, winning way, and&#xD;
took her hand, and stole her arm over her shoulder, and said,&#xD;
tenderly-&#xD;
"Zuleime, my love, do not sit here by this open window.&#xD;
Let me close it, and lead you to the sofa."&#xD;
Thereis nothing so quiet as despair, except death. There&#xD;
is nothing so, docile as despair often is. The beauty knew&#xD;
this by a satanic inspiration, and calculated on it. Zuleime&#xD;
suffered herself to be led to the sofa, which was wheeled up.&#xD;
near the fire, as she would have permitted herself to be led&#xD;
auy, where else. Georgia sat down by her side, and passed&#xD;
het arm around her waist, and said-&#xD;
"My dear, I think you love your old father-do you&#xD;
not~"&#xD;
The poor girl raised her eyes mournfully to the lady's&#xD;
face, as if she did not understand~&#xD;
"You love your father. You would not be willing to&#xD;
see him ruined in fortune, and degraded in honor, would&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
Still Zuleime kept her eyes fixed upon the speaker, with&#xD;
an expression of hopeless imbecility. ~&#xD;
"My dear child, let me be explicit. And try to under-&#xD;
stand me, Zuleime. It is of vital necessity to your father&#xD;
that you should. Will you listen to me, Zuleime 'P'&#xD;
"Yes," said the mourner, mechanically, without remo~ring&#xD;
her gaze.&#xD;
"Well, then, you know your grandmother left you thirty&#xD;
thousand dollars ~ Well. Your father owes debts amount-&#xD;
ing to twenty-five thousand dollars, and is in danger of an&#xD;
execution or a prison, every day! You would willingly give&#xD;
him your fortune to pay his debts with, we know. But, un-&#xD;
fortunately, you cannot do it, because you are not of age.&#xD;
Neither can your father appropriate it, of course. But if&#xD;
you were to marry, then your husband would be in legal&#xD;
possession of that property, and could dispose of it. Now,&#xD;
Major Cabell has bought up your father's notes to the&#xD;
amount of eighteen thousand dollars, using all his available&#xD;
funds, for the purpose of saving him from great distress, and&#xD;
in the expectation of marrying you, his daughter, and ob-&#xD;
taining your little fortune, which would replenish his cofli3rs&#xD;
again. Now, Zuleime, Major Cabell is himself pressed for&#xD;
money. He would not, of course, come down upon your&#xD;
father with an execution, but he will be compelled to sell&#xD;
those notes again for whatever he can get for them. And&#xD;
then of course the purchaser-some Jew or broker, would&#xD;
have no such scruples, but would levy on all the personal&#xD;
property of his debtor, and most likely throw him into prison,&#xD;
where he might languish for years-where he might die!&#xD;
Zuleime! you will not suffer this, if you can prevent it, will&#xD;
you ~ Speak to me, my love! I do not believe you under-&#xD;
stand me. now! Why don't you answer me, Zuleime ~"&#xD;
"I-I don't know. Yes I do. It was about a-about a&#xD;
-about somebody's going to prison. Was it the murderer ~&#xD;
Alas, that will not bring him back. Neither do I wish it.&#xD;
Not even I, who loved him so. I would not make any body&#xD;
suffer, for the world. Oh, no."&#xD;
The beauty looked at the pale girl in deep perplexity a&#xD;
moment, and then said-&#xD;
"Zuleime, your father is suffering! Let's see if that will&#xD;
rouse you !"&#xD;

"My father? Oh, no, he mustn't. Tell him not to' mind&#xD;
it. I do not, much, now. I know he is at rest.. And we&#xD;
shall be, soon. Tell him not to mind it."&#xD;
"Zuleime! Awake! Arouse yourself! Your father is in&#xD;
danger, I tell you'!"&#xD;
"In danger-in danger. Tell me about it."&#xD;
"Listen to me, then! Rouse your mind! and fix it&#xD;
upon what I am going to tell you about your father's peril."&#xD;
And the lady took her hands and looked into her eyes,&#xD;
watching their expression, and bringing back her wandering&#xD;
ideas every time they showed the least sign of flying, and&#xD;
rousing up her flagging intellect every time it betrayed a&#xD;
disposition to sink-and so repeated the whole history of the&#xD;
difficulty over again. But the distracted mind of the poor&#xD;
girl was' scarcely able to follow the pains~.taking narrator&#xD;
through the facts of the case. Passing her hand once or&#xD;
twice across her corrugated brow, she said-&#xD;
"What-what is it you say about father, and prisons, and&#xD;
Major Cabell? I-I am afraid my memory isn't as good as&#xD;
it used to be-please tell me over again."&#xD;
The beauty, wjth a shrug of her shoulders, reiterated the&#xD;
story, placing it in the fewest, simplest, ~and most direct&#xD;
words she could find. But the stricken girl only looked&#xD;
sorely distressed and perplexed, and said, plaintively-&#xD;
"Please forgive me, and tell me what it is that threatens&#xD;
father !"&#xD;
"An execution-that will sweep off all the furniture from&#xD;
the house, and all the negroes from the plantation; parting&#xD;
husbands and wives, and parents and children, and brothers&#xD;
and sisters, among those poor, faithful creatures who love&#xD;
you so well. , for your father's person, a jail, where he&#xD;
may be for years, or until he dies."&#xD;
"Oh, pray doli't talk to me any, more, my head is so wild,&#xD;
so wandering, it wants to go back to something," said the&#xD;
poor thing, pressing her temples, and strongly attracted to&#xD;
her one great wo.&#xD;
"But your father!"&#xD;
"Yes! Oh, only tell me what you want me to do !"&#xD;
"To nrnrry Major (Jabell, who will then have the disposal&#xD;
of your fortune, and can cover those notes and save your&#xD;
father."&#xD;
&#xD;
* "But-oh, yes! Now "I remember. Father said there&#xD;
was no necessity !" I needn't do it !" said the girl, pressing&#xD;
her finger hard upon the centre of her forehead, and. 'looking&#xD;
keen and old with the mental effort to bring memory, atten-&#xD;
tion and understanding ~o bear upon the subject. "Yes,&#xD;
yes, yes, yes,-he said I ~hould weep in peace."&#xD;
"Yes, your poor old father loves you better than himself.&#xD;
And he said that sooner than you should marry a iian you&#xD;
did not love, he would die in jail."&#xD;
"Did he? My dear good father! Oh, yes! now I think&#xD;
of it, it was something like that, sure enough! Only my&#xD;
head is 80 i~ueer! He must not go to jail-oh, never !"&#xD;
"tie must, unless you marry Major Cabell, and save&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Well, I can marry Major Cabell-it don't matter much-&#xD;
do you think it does? Spirits up in Heaven know nothing&#xD;
of what is going on on earth, or they know all about it, and&#xD;
either is better than our deceptive half'.knowledge. If spirits&#xD;
know anything, they will know our spirit. Dear. Frank will&#xD;
know-will know my spirit-nay, he does! I feel sure of&#xD;
it at this moment. I will marry Major Cabell."&#xD;
* "But, Zuleime, if your father thinks you dislike Major&#xD;
Cabell, he will not permit you to marry him."&#xD;
"But I don't dislike Major Cabell. I don't dislike any&#xD;
one. I could not now. It seems to me that I feel sorry for&#xD;
every one. I pity every one. Every one has so much trou-&#xD;
ble, mamma! Mamma, I feel' sorry for you. I do not know&#xD;
* how it is, but I do feel very sorry for you. Have you any&#xD;
trouble? You must have. Well, let God do as He pleases&#xD;
with you, because He knows best. Besides, it is only for a&#xD;
little while. And it will all come right. Kiss me, mamma.&#xD;
I don't think I loved you well enough when you first came&#xD;
here a stranger. Never mind, I will try to love you more m&#xD;
the future."&#xD;
Georgia let the poor girl kiss~ her, and then arose and made&#xD;
an excuse to go. Zuleime was weakening all her purposes.&#xD;
And she was obliged to escape as people fly sometimes from&#xD;
a sermon.&#xD;
"Please send Kate to me, xnamma," said Zuleime.&#xD;
And very soon Catherine entered.&#xD;
"Dear Kate! please come and comb and curl my hair,&#xD;

and put on my crimson 'dress, and make me decent and pretty&#xD;
to go down into the parlor to see Cousin Charles. It don't&#xD;
matter, you kiiow, Kate. Frank knows all about it. He&#xD;
thinks so, too. "Because he sees my heart is breaking all the&#xD;
faster for it, and that I shall the 'sooner be with him. You&#xD;
see, Kate, it is the heart-strings that hold the soul down to&#xD;
the body, and when they snap-there! It is off-it is gone&#xD;
'like a balloon,.-.when the cord is cut it ascends to Heaven!&#xD;
I feel light like that, sometimes, as if only one' little thread&#xD;
kept my souV down, and' if it were to snap, I could go."&#xD;
Catherine looked at the mourner in deep trouble. Then&#xD;
she began to take down her hair and comb its long sable&#xD;
tresses out, because she knew that in itself to be a soothing&#xD;
process. And she stood and combed and brushed it a long&#xD;
time, and then put it up, and bathed her face and hands.&#xD;
"Now, my crimson dress," said Zuleime, quietly.&#xD;
Catherine sat down by her side, and embracing her affec-&#xD;
'tionately, said-&#xD;
"Dear Zuleime, you are not quite well enough to go down&#xD;
into the parlor; and, besides, Major Cabell is not here. He&#xD;
is gone with some gentlemen upon the mountain to shoot&#xD;
birds."&#xD;
Zuleime sat silent for a long time, enveloped by Cathe-&#xD;
rine's arms, and leaning upon her shoulder. At last Kate&#xD;
whispered-&#xD;
"Dear Zuleime, confide in me, and relieve your overbur~-&#xD;
dened bosom. A secret is so hard to keep alone in a sor-&#xD;
row1~ul breast. Lay yours on my heart, Zuleime, and it shall&#xD;
be safer there than my own life. Tell me-what tie is it&#xD;
that binds you to Frank i!"&#xD;
"Hush,' oh, hush !"&#xD;
"Tell me, darling-you know it is not from curiosity I&#xD;
ask-it is that I wish you to relieve your heart."&#xD;
"Hush! I pron sed him not to tell."&#xD;
"Death absolves you from that promise. A painful secret&#xD;
is very hard to keep alone. I know it, dearest, for I, too,&#xD;
have a secret. Now will you trust me&#xD;
"Hush! hush! It was his last request-I must comply&#xD;
with it !" said the girl, with wild eyes.&#xD;
Catherine knelt down before her, clasped her arms arQund&#xD;
her, and ~partly to win' her confidence, and partly to draw&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
her mind from dwelling upon the wo that was crazing her,&#xD;
said                               1&#xD;
"Zuleime, look at me. I am going to tell you my secret,&#xD;
that which it will pain and humble my heart to tell !-that&#xD;
which it makes my. cheek burn now only to think of! Zu-&#xD;
leime, I love a map yho never sought, and who would despise&#xD;
my love! And ~hh whom it is forever and forever impossi-&#xD;
ble that I should marry. Yet I love him so much~-so much,&#xD;
that my heart is ready to burst with its powerless longing to&#xD;
do him some good! Zuleime, I would give him myself-.-.&#xD;
(nay, never mind my cheek burning-I will speak in spite of&#xD;
its protest)-or any dearest faculty or possession of mine, if&#xD;
it only could increase his happiness. Zuleime, there is a&#xD;
richness and fullness of joy in sacrificing one's self for one&#xD;
e love that passes all understanding."&#xD;
in "],~j~now there is," breathed the mourner, looking down&#xD;
face seriously.&#xD;
"That is the joy that I long for. And oh, believe me, I&#xD;
would sacrifice myself or any possession or faculty I have, if&#xD;
it would only add to his happiness or power. Eyesight is a&#xD;
precious treasure, is it not ~ If I could give mine to him,&#xD;
and endow him with perfect vision down to deep old agej&#xD;
would consent to be dark forever. The power of speech is&#xD;
a great gift-if by the loss of mine I could endow him with&#xD;
irresistible eloquence, I would be dumb forever. He, thinks,&#xD;
Zuleime, that I have talent. And sometimes I think-but&#xD;
I don't know, either! Anyhow, if by yielding all mine I&#xD;
could add a mite to the treasures of his intellect, II would be&#xD;
willing to be a fool for life. In a word-if by abdicating all&#xD;
my being, I could add to the largeness of his life, I would&#xD;
glow with joy to do it."&#xD;
"Do ~not love him so! He will die if you do! I know&#xD;
it! Frank died !"&#xD;
"And yet, Zuleime, it is not that I wish to lose my being,&#xD;
but to add to it. I do not know why it is, butT feel-not&#xD;
like an individual, independent existence, but like the&#xD;
complement of that other existence-a half ~fe-not full&#xD;
and complete of' itself, waiting to be joined to the other&#xD;
half."&#xD;
"He will love you. He will find you out," said Zuleime.&#xD;
And 'her words, and tone, and look thrilled like a prophecy&#xD;

~to the heart of Catherine, but she shook her head gravely,&#xD;
and answered--&#xD;
"Never, Zuleime! It would be a sin even to hope it!&#xD;
But, Zuleime, I have laid my secret on your heart-now will&#xD;
you confide in me&#xD;
"Oh, Kate! I would do it. I wish to do it! But I&#xD;
promised him!"&#xD;
"Dear Zuleime, when he required that of you, he did not&#xD;
think what might, what has happened. You must tell me,&#xD;
Zuleime. For if you have not some one with whom you can&#xD;
talk freely, you-I fear for you. You cannot bear your&#xD;
burden alone! Few human beings can! Tell me, darling '?"&#xD;
"Oh, Kate! It was the last thing he asked me! I must&#xD;
comply with his wish !"&#xD;
"Zuleime! I am about to cast away all reserve! I am&#xD;
about to tell you the name of him I love so madly. It is&#xD;
Archer Clifton, your cousin-your sister's betrothed! There!&#xD;
I have thrown open the very sanctuary of my heart to you.&#xD;
I have shown its secret sin and shame! Now, will you con..&#xD;
fide in me!"&#xD;
"Dear Kate! Dearest Kate! My own secret's without&#xD;
reserve, but not another~s.~,&#xD;
Catherine a~ose and took the seat by the mourner's side.&#xD;
Well would it have been for Zuleime in after life, if she&#xD;
could now have made a confidant as well as friend of ~the&#xD;
excellent girl. But at least Catherine's efforts had not been&#xD;
all in vain. The mind of the mourner was a little more&#xD;
rational-her part in conversation not quite so district.&#xD;
Presently Zuleime said-&#xD;
"It is getting towards evening. Cousin Charles will be&#xD;
back to supper. Curl my hair, Kate! and put on my crim-&#xD;
son dress, I must go down and spend the evening with them.&#xD;
in the parlor! I must, Kate. It is for my dear father's&#xD;
sitke! You do not know, Kate, else you would also advise&#xD;
it."&#xD;
Catherine essayed to prevent her, but finding her quite&#xD;
determined, yielded the point, and assisted her to dress.&#xD;
When her toilet was complete, she sat down again upon the&#xD;
sofa, and put her hand to her head in troubled thought.&#xD;
Then at last she spoke, saying-&#xD;
"Kate! I am afraid. It seems to me that-that my head&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
has not been quite right. And-and my speech has not&#xD;
been quite to the point. Kate, I want you to tell me-can&#xD;
I trust myself to talk, do you think ~ or had I better not try&#xD;
this evening ~ They might think me crazy if I should not&#xD;
talk straight! But I am not! I am not crazy-only~---&#xD;
Tell me how I am, and what I had better do, dear Kate '?"&#xD;
"Try to attend and be interested in what is going on,&#xD;
dearest, and talk when occasion presents itself. And do not&#xD;
be afraid. Every one will understand it is only nervousness,&#xD;
darling."&#xD;
"You encourage me, Catherine," said the poor girl, "and&#xD;
now just give me your arm down stairs."&#xD;
Kate complied with her request.&#xD;
The parlor was empty when they entered, and Zuleime&#xD;
had an opportunity of settling herself in a large arm-chair,&#xD;
and composing herself, before any one came in. Mr. Clifton,&#xD;
Major Cabell, and several other gentlemen returned from the&#xD;
shooting excursion and entered the parlor, together. Mr.&#xD;
Clifton looked surprised and pleased to see Zuleime, clothedd&#xD;
and in her right mind ;" and Major Cabell seemed interested&#xD;
and curious. Zuleime arose, and supported herself by restr-&#xD;
ing one hand upon the arm of the chair, while she, received&#xD;
the greetings of her father's guests. , And thanks to the&#xD;
shadowing of the black lustrous c~4'ls, and the reflection of&#xD;
i~he crimson dress, none could see ~he wanness of her face.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton and Miss Clifton entered soon after, and in the&#xD;
general conversation that ensued, poor Zuleime escaped par-&#xD;
ticular notice. Once Major CabeU contrived; without draw-&#xD;
ing attention upon himself, to find his way to her side, an&amp;amp;&#xD;
enter into conversation with~ her. And he was surprised,&#xD;
perplexed, nonplussed at the gentleness and almost tender-&#xD;
ness of her manner. Before leaving her he asked-&#xD;
"When can I have an interview with you, Zuleime 'P'&#xD;
"Whenever you please, Cousin Charles," she answered,&#xD;
gently.&#xD;
At parting, he pressed her hand, and to his surprise, the&#xD;
pressure was softly returned. And he left her, thinking&#xD;
"the sex" more of ariddle than he ever thought it before.&#xD;
The next 4ay, about noon, M~jor Cabell and Zuleinme met&#xD;
in the saloon, and had an interview of nearly an hour's&#xD;
length.&#xD;

When Zuleime left him and came out; she met her father&#xD;
in the hail. Taking his hands in hers, she looked up in his&#xD;
troubled face and said-&#xD;
"Dear father! you remember many weeks ago, you asked&#xD;
me to fix the day when I should be married to Cousin&#xD;
Charles 'P'&#xD;
"Never mind, never mind, my dear! That is all over&#xD;
now!. You shall not be troubled, my love !"&#xD;
"Dear father, I have just told Cousin Charles that I will&#xD;
give him my hand on Tuesday fortnight," said Zuleime, and&#xD;
pressing both the old man's hands to her lips, she turned and&#xD;
left him standing there in speechless astonishment, while she&#xD;
went up stairs-and throwing herself upon her knees by her&#xD;
bed, buried her face in the clothes, and breathed-" It won't&#xD;
be for long, Frank! Oh! Frank, you know it won't be for&#xD;
long !"&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
THE YOUNG MOURNER.&#xD;
Mine after life? What is mine after life?&#xD;
My day is closed. The gloom of night comes on,&#xD;
A hopeless darkness settles o'er my fate.-JoANNA BAILLT~.&#xD;
THERE is no state of mind so calm as that of hopelessness.&#xD;
And, therefore, there is none so often mistaken for resigna-&#xD;
tion. Zuleime'~ cheeks were pale and hollow, her eyes&#xD;
heavy and sunken, and surrounded by a dark, livid circle-.&#xD;
and she had contracted an unconsci6us habit of pressing her&#xD;
hand tightly over her heart, while a look of pain corrugated&#xD;
her brow. Yet, withal, she moved through the house very&#xD;
quietly-without a sigh or a tear-yea, even with a smile for&#xD;
whom she chanced to meet-a wan smile of tenderness, fel-&#xD;
low-feeling. For the grief that had come to her own young&#xD;
heart, had revealed to her the secret of a general sorrow,&#xD;
and awakened a deep human sympathy. Yet perhaps it was&#xD;
a morbid excess of this feeling that made her see, in every&#xD;
one she met, a fellow-sufferer. Her father misunderstood&#xD;
her serenity and her sweet smile. And his ,wife led him into&#xD;
that misunderstanding.&#xD;
"It is a merciful provision of Heaven, that young people&#xD;
of her tender age, can feel no lasting grief. At first, over&#xD;
any misfortune they lament excessively. But it is very&#xD;
soon forgotten," said Georgia.&#xD;
"Ah, yes! Chancy Cabell said something like the same&#xD;
thing, and, indeed, it seems to be true," replied Mr. Clifton.&#xD;
We are easily persuaded to believe that which we wish to&#xD;
credit. And so the old gentleman believed in the correctness&#xD;
of his wife's judgment, and in the reality of his daughter's&#xD;
peace.&#xD;
Major Cabell was baffled and perplexed. "Jealousy is as&#xD;
cruel as the grave," and so, also, is that base passion which&#xD;

&#xD;
often goes by the holy name of Love. It had been under&#xD;
the influence of both of these that Charles Cabell had sworn&#xD;
to punish Zuleime severely for what he called her faithless-&#xD;
ness. But for the present, at least, he was completely frus-&#xD;
trated. There was nothing to complain of in her conduct to&#xD;
him. She was very kind and gentle-not with the gentleness&#xD;
of meekness and humility, but with that of a compassionate&#xD;
toleration-such as an angel might feel in looking down&#xD;
upon. a determined. sinner-seeing his moral insanity, and&#xD;
foreseeing his consequent wretchedness. Major Cabell had&#xD;
frequently heard of mourners who could not bear to hear the&#xD;
names of their beloved, lamented dead, spoken before them.&#xD;
And he thought to torture her bosom by frequently revert-&#xD;
ing to " that horrible massacre," and "poor Frank." But&#xD;
he could not add one pang to those she had already endured.&#xD;
Her sorrow was too deep to be probed--to be touched by a&#xD;
superficial hand like his. She could bear to listen and reply&#xD;
when he talked of her massacred love. For like a stationary&#xD;
panorama of the past and the present, h lifee and death were&#xD;
ever before her mind. She could co verse, without new&#xD;
emotion, of him over whose fate, in its deepest, darkest hor-&#xD;
~rors, she was ever brooding. If any mourners cannot brook&#xD;
to hear the name of the lost mentioned in their presence, it&#xD;
is because they are already blessed with long seasons of for-&#xD;
getfulness, and shrink from the pain of remembrance. She&#xD;
had nio such pang of sudden recollection to dread. His me-&#xD;
mory-her sorrow-was ever present with her.&#xD;
Catherine watched her with deep and painful interest.&#xD;
She sought an opportunity, and once more had a serious con-&#xD;
versation with her. .&#xD;
" Zuleime, don't marry under present circumstances. If,&#xD;
as you say, your father is in the power of Major Cabell, it is&#xD;
bad. But if you marry him to deliver your father, it will be&#xD;
worse, and will not eventuate in any good. And two wrongs&#xD;
never make a right, Zuleime. Do no wrong, dearest, but&#xD;
trust in God for deliverance," said Catherine, earnestly.&#xD;
"It seems to me that I am doing right. It will please&#xD;
Cousin Charles, and save father. And as for myself-it&#xD;
can't matter much, you know," replied the despairing girl.&#xD;
And to this view of-the case she adhered, with all the tenacity&#xD;
of a morbid resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
218&#xD;
&#xD;
A few days .after this Catherine returned to her brother's&#xD;
cabin, wondering what new misfortune would-against her&#xD;
fixed determination-throw her back among the Cliftons.&#xD;
Major Cabell had written to Richmond for his mother and&#xD;
sisters to come down and be present at his marriage. And&#xD;
one day, near the last of the. week, the carriage of Mrs.&#xD;
Cabell rolled up to the door. Knowing nothing whatsoever&#xD;
of Zuleime's attachment to the young soldier, and consequent&#xD;
deep grief at his fate, they were very much shocked to see&#xD;
her looking so ill, but quietly ascribed it to fatigue and anx-&#xD;
iety in nursing Carolyn. .And Mrs. Cabell was emphatic in&#xD;
demonstrations of motherly kindness, which the gentle girl&#xD;
'acknowledged with grateful'smiles, and by such attentions as&#xD;
she had the power to bestow. The city ladies had made a&#xD;
short stage that day, and were but little wearied, so that&#xD;
after a little slumber, and the refreshment of the bath, and&#xD;
of tea, thcy felt well enough to spend the evening -in the&#xD;
parlor.&#xD;
The'-family were all around the evening, fire, when Mrs.&#xD;
Cabell and her daughters entered.,&#xD;
Major Cabell-who was as usual sitting by Zuleime, with&#xD;
his arm over the back' of her chair in a property-holding sort&#xD;
of manner-arose, and handing his mother to a seat, received&#xD;
from her hand a roll of papers.&#xD;
" It is some new music, my son, for the dear girls. There&#xD;
are some beautiful songs of Moore's just published. Carolyn,&#xD;
love, I have thirsted to hear your sweet voice again. Will&#xD;
you sing ?"&#xD;
Miss Cliftonis eyes filled- with tears, and she turned away&#xD;
her head.&#xD;
Zuleimie stole to her aunt's side, and while seeming to ex-&#xD;
amine the music, whispered-&#xD;
-" Dear Aunt Cabell, Carolyn has entirely lost her voice !"&#xD;
The lady was very much shocked to hear it, and grieved at&#xD;
her own unfortunate proposition, but durst not trust herself&#xD;
to reply, lest Carolyn should .hear and understand the sub-.&#xD;
ject of their conversation.&#xD;
Major Cabell, who was turning over the music, suddenly&#xD;
had his gaze fixed by one particular piece. His eyes lighted&#xD;
up with a peculiar satisfaction, and turning to .Zuleime, he&#xD;
said-&#xD;
&#xD;

"My own. you can read music at sight. Can you not V'&#xD;
"Yes," replied the girl.&#xD;
"And you can sing and play at sight-can you not V'&#xD;
"Yes, if it is not too difficult."&#xD;
"Is this difficult 'P' he asked, holding a page out to her.&#xD;
"No, that is very simple," said Zuleime, looking entirely&#xD;
at the music-not at the words.&#xD;
"It is a ballad of Thomas Moore's. I wish you to sing it&#xD;
for us. Will you V'&#xD;
"Certainly."&#xD;
"Come, then," he said, and took her hand, and led her&#xD;
to the piano. He seated her, and laid the song before her,&#xD;
saying to himself, "If she can sing that through without emo-&#xD;
tion-ay, or with emotion-if she can get through it at all-.&#xD;
she can do, or suffer anything! She is a heroine."&#xD;
Zuleime was reading over the words, preparatory to sing..&#xD;
ing them.&#xD;
And he was watching her intently. But she read through&#xD;
the song, turning the leaves calmly, her pale cheek never&#xD;
changing its hue. Then she restored the first page to its&#xD;
place before her, and began to play the prelude. The ladies&#xD;
and old Mr. Clifton drew near, and gathered around her.&#xD;
Then her voice arose, soft,.clear and plaintive, but unfalter-&#xD;
ing as her cheek remained unchanging-though her father&#xD;
trembled for her as the words of the song fell on his ear.&#xD;
That song was "The Broken Heart," by Thomas Moore.&#xD;
Zuleime sang-&#xD;
She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps,&#xD;
And lovers around her are sighing,&#xD;
But coldly she turns from iheir gaze and weeps,&#xD;
For her heart in his grave is lying.&#xD;
She sings the wild songs of her dear native plains,&#xD;
Every note which he loved awaking:&#xD;
Ah! little they think, who delight in her strains,&#xD;
How the heart of the minstrel is breaking.&#xD;
Her voice faltered-she paused.&#xD;
"Come! no miserable, maudlin, mawkish self-pity, I be-&#xD;
seech you !" whispered Major Cabell, stooping to her ear.&#xD;
Whether Mr. Clifton heard the cruel whisper, or whether&#xD;
he only saw her slight agitation, is uncertain-but ~ie drew&#xD;
near and stood by her side. She recovered, and continued-&#xD;

&#xD;
tie had lived for his love, for his country he died,&#xD;
They were all that to life-&#xD;
She paused again-again essayed to sing-her voice qua-&#xD;
vering, sunk into silence like the rudely-swept strings of the&#xD;
harpsichord-~-the grayness of death crept over her counte-&#xD;
nance, and she fell back into the arms of her father, who&#xD;
angrily exclaimed-&#xD;
"Charles! you are a brute! ~ demon! to ask her to sing&#xD;
that song. Zuleirne! Zuleime, my darling! speak to me&#xD;
lie sat down on the sofa, holding her in his arms. The&#xD;
ladies drew around with fans, with cold water, with hartshorn.&#xD;
But she recovered very soon, and sat up-and declined going&#xD;
up stairs to bed-and thanked them all for their care, gently~&#xD;
begging them not to take so much trouble on her ac-&#xD;
count.&#xD;
"This is all Very strange, macfain," said Mrs. Cabell, aside&#xD;
to Mrs. Clifton.&#xD;
"Zuleime is so nervous and sensitive ever since Carolyn's&#xD;
illness, that the news of that massacre, and the death of her&#xD;
old playmate and companion, has quite overwhelmed her. I&#xD;
suppose this music awoke h6r sensibilities," said Georgia,&#xD;
composedly.&#xD;
If Mrs. Cabell had any suspicion of the truth, she was too&#xD;
well bred to express it then and there. And the matter ended&#xD;
for the moment.&#xD;
But after this evening, Zuleimo was never the same. Her&#xD;
fortitude seemed entirely to have given away. Her calmness&#xD;
was utterly broken up. A 'strange, wild terror and incerti-&#xD;
tude had come upon her.&#xD;
The next day, Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, came over to&#xD;
call on the visitors. Nevertheless, in the course of the call,&#xD;
Major Cabell found the opportunity he sought, of taking Zu-&#xD;
leime to task for what he called her miserable weakness.&#xD;
"You are unfaithful-false at heart-you cherish the&#xD;
image of this young man secretly, while you pretend to be&#xD;
true to me!. Pah! Well! why don't you answer me ~ Have&#xD;
you anything to say ~"&#xD;
"Cousin Charles, does not the grave sanctify any affec-&#xD;
tion? Is it a crime to remember a dead friend ?"&#xD;
"lit is a miserable, ruling weakness! a maudlin, mawkish,&#xD;
driving, puling piece of unfaithfulness to duty-and leads&#xD;

Such whining, whimpering, contemptible self-pity!/ I protest&#xD;

with in my life. It is your own griefs and regrets and re-&#xD;

Come ! say ! Wasn't it self-pity ?"&#xD;
"JVNo, nor was it the song. If I pitied myself, should I&#xD;
not pity you as much ? It is not such a happy fate, Cousin&#xD;
Qharles, to marry a grief-stricken girl like me, I know."&#xD;
"XJVo! If I calculate upon your continued indulgence of&#xD;
that grief, which I do not ! NJVo! Trust me on the part of&#xD;
my wife, there must and sh'all be no such exhibitions of feel-&#xD;

"I do not know why you wvish to~ marry me !" she broke&#xD;
fdrth, with strange wildness. " You do not love me ! Per-&#xD;
haps you hate me, and marriage will give you the same power&#xD;
to work out your hate as it would to act out your love ! Yes !&#xD;
I do suppose that is really the key to the riddle !"-&#xD;
" Perhaps it is," he answered, sarcastically.&#xD;
" One thing I beg of you," she said ; " while we stay here&#xD;
-in my father's presence-try to use me kindly-to spare&#xD;
his feelings-he is an old mnan. Reserve your vengeance&#xD;
until I am your wife, until we get to Richmond, when you&#xD;
will have full power, and ample time and space to work your&#xD;
will."&#xD;
While she spoke so wildly, she pressed and rubbed her&#xD;
hand spasinodically against her heart. And her pale brow&#xD;
was corrugated, and her intense black eyes strained and sharp-&#xD;
ened as by mental and physical pain. She gasped for breath,&#xD;
and began again.&#xD;
" I do not know-I am sure-I cannot tell-whether-,&#xD;
after all, we will ever mnar-2'&#xD;
What she was about to say was cut short by the entrance&#xD;
of Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, who came in, with her shawl&#xD;
and bonnet on, to take leave of Zuleime and Major CabeHl,&#xD;
and invite them to join the rest of thie family i11 coming to&#xD;
dine and spend the evening at Hardbargain the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Major Cabell accepted the invitation for himself and Zuleime,&#xD;
and the lady took her departure.&#xD;
The next day was Saturday. The family set out on their&#xD;
visit, at an early hour of the day, as is the social custom of&#xD;
country neighbors. Old Mr. Clifton, his wife, and his eldest&#xD;
daughter, rode in his carry-all.. Mrs. Cabell and her three&#xD;
daughters went in that lady's carriage. Zuleime rode on&#xD;
horseback, attended by Major Cabell.&#xD;
It was a glorious Indian summer day, when the splendor&#xD;
of the autumnal sunlight would be too dazzling, but for the&#xD;
soft, warm mist spread veil-like over it. At another time,&#xD;
Zuleime, true worshiper of nature, might have drawn deep&#xD;
draughts of pleasure from the beauty of the scene. But&#xD;
now the gorgeous magnificence of the forests, in their many&#xD;
colored foliage-the misty mountain steeps softening the glory&#xD;
-the fine transparent neutral tint of the heavens leading&#xD;
the eye and mind up through infinite heights of ethier-the&#xD;
glowing clouds reposing along the horizon-all were lost upon&#xD;
her.&#xD;
An hour's ride by the carriage road brought the party to&#xD;
'Hardbargain.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton received them with her usual quiet cordiality.&#xD;
There-was something very composing in that calm, kind, self-&#xD;
possessed woman's manner. There was something very se-&#xD;
dative also in the air of her home. In her company and in&#xD;
her house the restless became quiet, the anxions easy, the&#xD;
desponding cheerful, even the despairing mourners over some&#xD;
great heart-.wreck, grew languidly aware of how much good&#xD;
was left them in the comforts of daily domestic life, and the&#xD;
amenities of social intercourse.&#xD;
She was strikingly like her son. One was inclined to won..&#xD;
der how they-so nearly identical in features and complexion&#xD;
-should differ so widely in many points of character and&#xD;
sentiment, and had to remember that all in which he did not&#xD;
resemble her was inherited from the Cliftons. Kate felt the&#xD;
likeness keenly. And when the lady turned those quiet,&#xD;
brilliant eyes upon her, her heart thrilled to the glance with&#xD;
strange pain and pleasure. Anda when once or twice-for&#xD;
the lady was never very demonstrative in her affection-she&#xD;
had quietly drawn then maiden to her* bosom-it was such'a&#xD;
heart-feeding comfort, that Kate felt there would be no pos-&#xD;

sibility of forgetting Archer Clifton, while thrown into daily&#xD;
intercourse with his mother. Once when Mrs. Clifton had&#xD;
looked tenderlfinto her eyes, and drawn and pressed he&#xD;
closely against her breast, the girl, lost for an instant, ha&#xD;
thrown her arms around the lady, and buried her face in her&#xD;
bosom. And for some time after that, terrified at her own&#xD;
impulse, she had been as shy of the mother, as she could have&#xD;
been of the son. Kate had kept away from llardbargain for&#xD;
many weeks, but to-day, when the party from White Cliffs had&#xD;
arrived, Mrs. Clifton sent for her, with the message that her&#xD;
friend Zuleime had come. That was no sufficient lure to the&#xD;
resolute girl, however, who had once for all determined that&#xD;
nothing but the absolute necessities of others should draw&#xD;
her again into the dangerous association of the Cliftons. She&#xD;
returned thanks to the lady, declining the visit. Mrs. Clif-&#xD;
ton was disappointed in missing the society of her young fa-&#xD;
vorite for that day. Yet the time passed very pleasantly&#xD;
notwithstanding. There is scarcely any such thing as a stiff&#xD;
dinner party in the country. And -such a thing was impos-&#xD;
sible at Hardbargain. The ladies had all brought their&#xD;
"parlor work"w-.flue netting, knotting, knitting, or sewing-&#xD;
and they worked and conversed in a quiet, pleasant way,&#xD;
while the gentlemen mingled in their conversation, or talked&#xD;
with each other upon the two reigning subjects of country&#xD;
discussion-agriculture and po1itics-~-or sauntered out upon&#xD;
the lawn to ei~joy the fine autumnal weather until dinner.&#xD;
After which, the ladies jn the cozy parlor lounged a little&#xD;
more lazily, and grew a great deal more kindly in their inter-&#xD;
change of thought and sentiment, and the gentlemen enjoyed&#xD;
a promenade on the piazza, and the stolen luxury of their&#xD;
cigars.&#xD;
After an early tea the party took leave. They returned&#xD;
in the same ~manner in which they had come. Zuleime on&#xD;
horseback, escorted by Major Cabell; the others in carriages.&#xD;
- Even the soothing influence of Mrs. Clifton's home and&#xD;
society had almost failed to quiet the miserable girl. Her&#xD;
manner, all day long, had been erratic in the extreme-now&#xD;
depressed into gloom-sunken nearly to the depth of stu-&#xD;
pidity-now full of "starts and flow~" as the crime-&#xD;
burthened Macbeth. As she rode home, in perfect silence,&#xD;
the evil eye of her companion watched her. stealthily. Her&#xD;
&#xD;
.TIIE CURSE OF CLIFToN~           225&#xD;
cheek was pale and hollow, and her eye sunken and heavy.&#xD;
Yet sometimes -her eyes would lighten as with sudden terror,&#xD;
1~ke those of a startled hare, and her cheek would flush and&#xD;
fade. The road was broad, yet shadowy, from the meeting&#xD;
of the branches of the huge trees overhead. And so soon&#xD;
as the sun went down it became too dusky to permit him to&#xD;
see the flickering and sinking of the fire in her eye and cheek,&#xD;
but he watched her closely; nevertheless. Suddenly he saw&#xD;
her sway to and fro in the saddle, like a reed blown by the&#xD;
wind. Then, ere he could spying to her aid, the reins dropped&#xD;
from her hands, and she fell from the horse, her foot ~ateh-.&#xD;
mg in the stirrup. The well-trained palfrey stopped, and&#xD;
stood without so much as lifting a hoof. With a deep curse,&#xD;
Major Cabell threw himself from his steed, and raised her,&#xD;
disengaging her foot from the stirrup. He sat down on a&#xD;
bank, with her on his knees, and took off her hat, and began&#xD;
to feel her head, neck and arms, for ir~juries. It seemed im-&#xD;
possible to tell whether, or how she, was hurt. The carriages&#xD;
were some yards behind, and concealed by a turn of the road.&#xD;
He dipped his hand in a run, at the foot of the bank, and&#xD;
sprinkled her face; and before the carriages arrived, she had&#xD;
opened her eyes, and sat up. She said that she was net hurt-.&#xD;
that it was only a fainting spell, such as she had had at the&#xD;
piano. But her voice was very weak, and., her frame trem~-&#xD;
bling, and her general manner frightened. She placed her&#xD;
hand against Major Cabell's chest, partly to assist herseli~ in&#xD;
rising, partly to push him away, and stood alone upon her&#xD;
feet, until her father's Ca'rriage drew up. Then she said she&#xD;
was tired, and wished to get in.&#xD;
Old Mr. CliftQn sent a glance of impotent rage at Major&#xD;
Cabell, as he lifted his child in-placing her in the vacant&#xD;
fourth seat-.-the      ee being oc&#xD;
other thr        eupied by his wife, eldest&#xD;
daughter, and himself.&#xD;
Zuleime sat next to her sister, an~ opposite Georgia; and&#xD;
the last mentioned lady studied her vis-a-vis, with as much&#xD;
interest, and with far more curiosity and comprehension, than&#xD;
Major Cabell had exercised.&#xD;
The girl sat perfectly still, and quite lost to all around&#xD;
her. But Geoi~gia saw that it was the fearful stillness of&#xD;
self-restrained frenzy.&#xD;
They reached home at last. Georgia was handed out first;&#xD;

&#xD;
she waited for Zuleline, who followed. She wished to draw.&#xD;
the girl's arm within her own. But Zuleime, turning on her&#xD;
a dilated, strained, fiery gaze, fled past her into the hous~.&#xD;
And then the lady saw, with a shudder, that it was indeed&#xD;
the fires of incipient madness that kindled the lambent flame&#xD;
in the girl's eyes!&#xD;
When they were all assembled in the parlor, around the&#xD;
evening fire, with books, and mu~ic, and light needle-work-&#xD;
"Where is Zuleime V' asked ber father.&#xD;
"She has retired to her room, very much fatigued," re-&#xD;
plied his wife, and the subject dropped.&#xD;
The next morning, when the family gathered around the&#xD;
breakfast-table, the youngest daughterwas still missing.&#xD;
"Where is Zuleime? Why doesn't Zuleime come? Caro-&#xD;
lyn, have you seen your sister this morning? how is she '?"&#xD;
asked old Mr. Clifton.&#xD;
Carolyn replied that she had not seen her since the pre-&#xD;
ceding evening.~&#xD;
"Send some one, then, to her chamber, to see how she is,&#xD;
and whether she will join us at breakfast, or have anything&#xD;
sent up to her room. Or-stay! Carolyn, don't send-go&#xD;
yourself, 'my love, to your sister, it will be only kind."&#xD;
Carolyn left the table, and went up stairs, and after an&#xD;
absence of fifteen or twenty minutes, returned, and announced,&#xD;
with a pale cheek, that 2~uleime's chamber had not been oc-&#xD;
cupied duriug~the night-that she herself was no where to be&#xD;
found in the house-and that no one of the servants had seen&#xD;
her since the evening before!&#xD;
A dreadful suspicion instantly seized upon all who reinem-&#xD;
bered her wild and moody looks and manners of the preceding&#xD;
few days; and they simultaneously arose from the table, and&#xD;
with looks of alarm, dispersed in various directions, in quest&#xD;
of the missing girl.&#xD;
The hc~use, kitchen, out-buildings, negro quarters, garden,&#xD;
vineyard, orchard, the plantation and the woods were succes-&#xD;
sively and vainly searched.&#xD;
Messengers were dispatched to Hardbargain 'and to the&#xD;
neighboring plantations, with inquiries that proved fruitless.&#xD;
-~ Old Mr. Clifton ran up and down the house and grounds&#xD;
like one distracted.&#xD;
At last, near night, traces were discovered of the lost one.&#xD;
&#xD;
226&#xD;
&#xD;
IlTpon the edge of the stream, where the banks were soft and&#xD;
deep, small foot-prints were seen-.and hidf-way down the&#xD;
bank her little slipper was found, with its toe deep in the&#xD;
mud, and the ~heel sticking up, as if lost there in the down-&#xD;
ward run of its owner-and from the branch of a sapling&#xD;
near, a shred of her crimson dress fluttered, as if caught and~&#xD;
torn off in the same swift descent.&#xD;
Old Mr. Clifton walked down there, to see the spot; but&#xD;
he was carried back.&#xD;
And before the next sun arose, Mrs. Georgia Clifton had&#xD;
her heart's first desire.&#xD;
She was a widow.&#xD;

No mother-God forgot me-and I fell!&#xD;
BROWNING-BLOT ON T-HE 'ScUTcHEoN.&#xD;
&#xD;
A RETROsPECTr of several hwurs is necessary here. You&#xD;
will remember that during the drive home from Hardbargain,&#xD;
Mrs. Georgia Clifton had watched Zuleime with much in-&#xD;
terest and curiosity, and with mere perspicuity. When the&#xD;
unfortunate girl had sprung from the carriage, and fled up&#xD;
the steps into the house, Mrs. Clifton had followed her. In-&#xD;
stead of going up into her chamber, she had passed directly&#xD;
through the ha;ll, and gone out at the back-door-Georgia&#xD;
having kept near her. There was the kitchen garden at the&#xD;
back of the house, and' then the vineyard, and then the&#xD;
orchard-through all these she successively passed, with the&#xD;
same wild, hurried gait, and entered the forest beyond, and&#xD;
descended into the deep glen, through which the mountain-&#xD;
stream roared. It was very difficult to follow the reckless&#xD;
steps of the fugitive down this rough declivity, and while&#xD;
cautiously descending, with the aid of projecting fragments&#xD;
of rock and smaller branches of trees and bushes, Georgia&#xD;
lost sight of the girl. When she reached the bottom of the&#xD;
gorge, through which the torrent raged and raved, Zuleime&#xD;
was no where to be seen,.&#xD;
The night was very, dark, and though a few large, brilliant&#xD;
stars were to be seen directly over head, yet low from the&#xD;
horizon, heavy, black masses of clouds were slowly rolling&#xD;
up. And the wind moaned and died away at intervals--&#xD;
prophetic of the winter's storm. The single, large stars&#xD;
overhead were reflected in the stream-not clearly and&#xD;
calmly, but plunging and leaping with the wild water. The&#xD;
banks each side lay shropided in gloom and mystery, rocks&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
-228&#xD;
&#xD;
229&#xD;
&#xD;
and trees indistinctly blended together in dark and sombre&#xD;
hues. The everlasting mountains stood around, vast, vague,&#xD;
and awful. The seven white peaks gleamed up in the back&#xD;
ground, like the ghostly genii of the scene. .A shiver of&#xD;
superstitious fear shook the frame of Georgia, and she had'&#xD;
turned to retrace her steps home, when assound between a&#xD;
inoan and a suffocating sob arrested her purpose. She crept&#xD;
towards the spot whence -the sound proceeded, and there,&#xD;
half hidden in. the deep gloom of overhanging willows, she&#xD;
dimly discerned the figure of the unhappy girl, endingg over&#xD;
the stream, and gazing intently upon the water, where the&#xD;
reflection of the stars leaped and plunged with the waves.&#xD;
As if communing with herself,, she -murmured-" There is&#xD;
peace there ! There is peaceghere!" Then her form bent&#xD;
lower, her gaze grew more earnest and intense, as though&#xD;
body, soul and spirit were irresistibly fascinated, drawn&#xD;
down by the glaniour of the water ! And-" Thei'e is peace,&#xD;
deep peace. there," she muttered ! How stormy must- have&#xD;
been the soul that saw deep peace in the. raging torrent !&#xD;
Her eyes shone in the dusk with a bright, phosphoric light,&#xD;
and still pouring their splendor upon the dark, wild water,&#xD;
she murmured---" Peace ! deep peace." Suddenly up flew&#xD;
her arms, and she sprang forward.&#xD;
The ready hand of Georgia caught hershoulder and pulled&#xD;
her back, exclaiming-&#xD;
S" Mad girl! What are you about to do ?"&#xD;
Zuleime sprang around with her eyes all wide and ablaze,&#xD;
like one suddenly waking up from a terrible dream, and not&#xD;
yet quite brought to consciousness. Georgia drew her away&#xD;
from the dangerous proximity of the torrent. Zuleime threw&#xD;
her hands to her head with sudden recollection and intensity&#xD;
of consciousness, and sunk down at the feet of the lady,&#xD;
clasping her knees, and 2exclaiming-&#xD;
" Oh ! you don't know what you've done ! Why did you&#xD;
pluck me back ! There was -peace there ! The only peace&#xD;
left for mel!"&#xD;
'"You are frantic, miserable girl! What is the meaning&#xD;
of this madness ?" asked 'Georgia, in a stern, curt tone.&#xD;
Convulsive sobs, shaiking as with a tempest the form of the&#xD;
girl, alone answered her.&#xD;
" What will your father-what will your intended hus-.&#xD;

band think of this ? Say ! Speak ! What do you suppose&#xD;
Major Cabel-"&#xD;
"Oh! do not speak of him !" gasped the girl.&#xD;
" Will you tell me what you mean by this conduct 'P'&#xD;
sneered Georgia.&#xD;
" Mamma-" commenced Zuleime-but her voice broke&#xD;
down. A&#xD;
" Zuleime ! come ! get up and come home !"&#xD;
" Oh, no, no, no! JVot home!- .Never home again!"&#xD;
" Once more, what am I to think of this frantic be-&#xD;
&#xD;
haviour.&#xD;
"Mamma !"&#xD;
" Don't call me mamma, if you please ! It may not be&#xD;
pleasant or politic, to acknowige that tender relationship.&#xD;
*But explain yourself, lest I bring you to those who will de-&#xD;
mand the explanation with less forbearance !"&#xD;
" Mercy ! 'mercy ! I will tell you anything ! everything !&#xD;
Only do not kill my father with the story !"&#xD;
"Speak, then !"&#xD;
ILadyan ?&#xD;
But some feeling stronger than fear, gripped her heart&#xD;
and stopped her speech.&#xD;
" Zuleime ! How long will you try my patience ?" .&#xD;
" Madam__"&#xD;
Another hesitation.&#xD;
"What, then ?"&#xD;
" I have been-a wife! I am-a widow ! I am fated&#xD;
to be-"&#xD;
" Well," asked Georgia, in a deep-drawn breath between&#xD;
her teeth, " you are fated to be-"&#xD;
".4 mother I" breathed the girl, in a dying voice, cover-&#xD;
ing her face with both hands, and sinking lower on the&#xD;
ground.'&#xD;
There was a long, deep pause, filled up with the roar of&#xD;
the torrent and the moan of the rising wind. Suddenly&#xD;
up sprang Zuleime, with fire in her eyes, and made a dash&#xD;
towards thie water. The 'swift arm of Gieorgia caught and&#xD;
dragged her back. No word was spoken yet. The impulse&#xD;
of frenzy passed off, and Zuleime sunk into her old'&#xD;
posture&#xD;
1CC&#xD;
&#xD;
280&#xD;
&#xD;
" Get up," at last said Georgia, half-shaking, half-putting&#xD;
the girl upon her feet. " Get up and come with me."&#xD;
And she drew her to a fragment of rock, at a safer dis-&#xD;
tance, pushed her down on the seat, and dropped herself by&#xD;
heir side.&#xD;
""Now, tell me of this," she commanded, in a hard, curt&#xD;
tone. " You were married ?"&#xD;
." Yes, yes !&#xD;
-" Who was your husband ?"&#xD;
" Ah, you know ! You must know ! He who died in&#xD;
yonder field of blood, under the tomahawk of the Shosho-&#xD;
nowa-I am very wretched !"&#xD;
" Stay !-is this true-about the marriage, I mean ?"&#xD;
"True as God's Word !"~&#xD;
" Certainly the marriage was not legal without your&#xD;
father's cotisent, and would have been annulled by him. But&#xD;
now he will perjjmit his consent to be supposed. Let's see!&#xD;
the widow of an army officer entitled to his half-pay, per-&#xD;
haps ; I do not know.-perhaps to a pension,. too, asr he died&#xD;
in the field of battle. Zuleime, upon~ the whole, I think that&#xD;
j  you were rash to attempt suicide. -Your position and pros-&#xD;
pects are not so bad. If'Major Cabell is anxious' to possess&#xD;
you, now that he supposes you to be a maudlin, love-sick&#xD;
'girl, grieving yourself to deaths over the grave of your lover,&#xD;
he will be quite as willing to marry you a year hence, when&#xD;
he knows you to be the widow of Captain Fairfax-for that,&#xD;
I understand, was his rank when he fell. Come, girl, live!&#xD;
Acknowledge your marriage, like a truthful woman ! Bring&#xD;
your child into God's world like-a Christian woman! And&#xD;
after a sufficient time has elapsed, marry Major Cabell, like&#xD;
a sensible woman ! For I do assure you, that the gallant&#xD;
,Major is sufficiently enamored of your young beauty to wait&#xD;
that length of time, if compelled to do so."&#xD;
" Ah, yes ! I think he is enamored of me as the Shosho-&#xD;
nowa was of poor Frank's hair !" bitterly said the girl.&#xD;
" This marriage ust be announced at once ! Who per-&#xD;
formed the ceremony ?"&#xD;
"Old Mr. Saunders, the Baptist preacher.'&#xD;
" What! He who was found dead in~his bed.&#xD;
"Yes, yes, it was he !"&#xD;
"Pity for your sake that he is dead! But, you doubtless&#xD;

"No! There was none! hf was so sudden !"&#xD;
"None !-no proof of your marriage! Yet stop-..~stay '!-.&#xD;
there is a chance yet, I believe; I do not know. You were&#xD;
married with a license, of course!"&#xD;
"Yes, yes!"&#xD;
"The county clerk who issued it will probably remember&#xD;
the occurrence. That will be something in your favor,&#xD;
though, ~alas! only imperfect, circumstantial evidence; for&#xD;
the mere taking out of a license is no conclusive proof of a&#xD;
marriage."&#xD;
"Ah, great or small, as proof it is of no avail. The&#xD;
license was procured btornk, for Carolyn and Archer, because&#xD;
he had forgotten her full name, and it was afterwards filled&#xD;
out with our' names."&#xD;
"No matter. You were married with it! 'And now I&#xD;

"I do pot know! I never saw it! If the parson gave&#xD;
~one, probably Frank took charge of it !"&#xD;
Again a pause fell between them, and the noises of the&#xD;
wind and waters arose in gloomy concert. At last Georgia&#xD;
spoke-.7-.&#xD;
"Miserable girl! And so you have no proof whatever of&#xD;
this asserted marriage !"&#xD;
"None! none! But oh, what does that matter, after all!&#xD;
God knows that we loved, and were married, as lie knows&#xD;

"And at any rate, girl, this plan is far better than the self~&#xD;

"Ah! to what end ~ To be as miserable as its mother ?"~,&#xD;

her hand to assist her in rising.&#xD;
The unhappy girl mechanically yielded herself to the&#xD;
guidance of "the dark ladie," and they ascended the glen. ;~~j&#xD;
Retracing their steps through forest, field, orchard, vine- ;&#xD;
