            <head>TO THE PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>AT the desire of MISS DAVENPORT, for whose benefit this collection of original
               Miscellanies by American authors has been made, I write this brief Preface, without
               having had time to read the contributions which it is designed to introduce. The
               names of the writers, however, many of which are among the most distinguished in our
               literature, and are honored wherever our language is spoken, will suffice to
               recommend the volume to the attention of the reading world.</p>
            <p>If this were not enough, an inducement of another kind is to be found in the
               circumstances of the lady in whose behalf the contents of this volume have been so
               freely contributed. A few years since, she was a teacher in our schools, active,
               useful, and esteemed for her skillful communication of knowledge. At that time it was
               one of her favorite occupations to make sketches and drawings from nature, an art in
               which she instructed her pupils. A severe illness interrupted her duties, during
               which her sight became impaired, and finally lost. A kind of twilight came over it,
               which gradually darkened into utter night, shutting out the face of nature in which
               she had so much delighted, and leaving her, without<pb n="viii-ix"
                  xml:id="VAC6523-00000005"/> occupation, in ill health. In this condition she has
               already remained for five years.</p>
            <p>To this statement of her misfortunes, which I trust will commend her to the
               sympathies of all who are made acquainted with them, as one who was useful to society
               while Providence permitted, I have only to add the expression of her warmest thanks
               to those who have generously furnished the contents of the volume she now lays before
               the public.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTORY.</head>
            <p>THIS volume speaks so well for itself that it does not need many words of preface to
               commend it to a wide circle of readers. Its rich and varied contents, however, become
               far more interesting when interpreted by the motive that won them from their authors;
               and when the kindly feeling that offered them so freely is known, these gifts, like
               the pearls of a rosary, will be prized not only severally but collectively, because
               strung together by a sacred thread.</p>
            <p>The story of this undertaking is a very short and simple one. Miss Davenport, who had
               been for many years an active and successful teacher in our schools and families,
               especially in the beautiful arts of drawing and painting, was prostrated by a severe
               illness, which impaired her sight and finally terminated in blindness.</p>
            <p>The late Benjamin F. Butler, in a letter dated October 13, 1858, which will have
               peculiar interest to the many readers who knew and honored that excellent man, writes
               thus:</p>
            <p>"Miss Davenport has for several years been personally known to me. She is now blind
               and unable to follow the<pb n="x-xi" xml:id="VAC6523-00000006"/> calling by which,
               before this calamity befell her, she obtained her living. Having lost her parents in
               early life, and having few relatives, and none able to assist her, she is dependent
               for her support on such efforts as she is still capable of making. These, were she a
               person of common fortitude, energy and hopefulness, would be very small, for to her
               great privation is added very imperfect general health. Yet she has struggled on in
               the hope of gaining such a competency as should ultimately secure 'a home that she
               may call her own.' I commend Miss Davenport to all who feel for the afflicted and who
               wish to do good."</p>
            <p>The Rev. Dr. S. Storrs writes: "Miss Davenport is a Christian woman, of great
               excellence of character, and of many accomplishments, whom God in his providence has
               made totally blind within a few years past."</p>
            <p>We need add but two remarks to these statements—one in reference to the volume itself
               and the other in reference to her for whose welfare it is contributed.</p>
            <p>The volume is one of the many proofs which have been gathering for years, of the
               alliance between literature and humanity. Every good and true word that has been
               written from the beginning has been a minister of mercy to every human heart which it
               has reached, whilst the mercy has been twice blessed when the word so benign in its
               result has been charitable in its intention, and the author at once yields his
               profits to a friend's need, and his production to the public eye. Thackeray has
               written well upon humor and charity, but should he undertake to carry out his idea
               and treat of literature and humanity in their vital relations, he would have his
               hands and heart full of work for more than a lifetime. Princes who give their gold to
               generous uses are worthy of honor; but there is a coinage of the brain that costs
               more and weighs more than gold. The authors of these papers would of course be little
               disposed to claim any high merit for their offerings, yet any reader who runs his eye
               over the list of contributors will see at once that they are generally writers whose
               compositions are eagerly sought for by the public, and among them are some names
               whose pens can coin gold whenever they choose to move. All these articles are
               original, and nothing is inserted in this book that has been before published. We are
               confident that it deserves, and will command wide and choice circulation</p>
            <p>A word as to the lady for whose benefit these gifts are brought together. The preface
               of Mr. Bryant and the letter of Mr. Butler, tell her story with sufficient
               distinctness, and the readiness with which our men and women of letters have so
               generally complied with her request, shows what eloquence she bears in her presence
               and statement. Some certificates from her pupils in drawing, who testify to her love
               of nature and her delight in sketching directly from nature, so greatly to their
               improvement in this beautiful art, give peculiar pathos to her case. The organ that
               was the source of her highest satisfaction is closed up by this dark sorrow, and the
               gate called Beautiful, to this earthly temple no longer is open to scenes and
                  faces<pb n="xii-13" xml:id="VAC6523-00000007"/> of loveliness. What a fearful loss
               is this loss of sight—on the whole the noblest of the senses, and certainly the sense
               of all others most serviceable, alike to the working hand and the creative
               imagination. The eye may not be so near the fountains of sensibility as the ear, and
               no impression reaches the sympathy so profoundly as the pathos of living speech, but
               the eye has a far wider range than the ear and fathoms the heavens and sweeps the
               earth and sea, whilst the ear hears distinctly but within a very narrow limit, hardly
               a stone's throw. When the eye, then, loses its marvellous faculty and sees no longer
               the light of day and the countenances of friends, let the ear do what it can to make
               up for the loss by every cheering word of sympathy and hope. In God's Providence
               there is a principle of compensation that aims to balance every privation by some new
               privilege, as for instance by giving new acuteness to the senses which are called to
               do the work of the senses lost. But genial humanity is the great principle of
               compensation, and by this God's children glorify the Father in Heaven. May this
               volume serve his merciful will, and may the light shed from the stars of our literary
               firmament do something to lessen the night upon every dark path.</p>

                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>How good a thing it is to live! The morn is full of music; and Annie is singing
                     in the hall!</p>
                  <p>The sun falls with a tranquil glory on the fields and forests, burning with the
                     golden splendors of the autumn—the variegated leaves of the mighty oaks are
                     draped about the ancient gables, like a trophy of banners. The landscape
                     sleeps; all the world smiles—shall not I?</p>
                  <p>I sat up late last night at my accounts; to-day I will take a holiday. The
                     squire has bidden me good morning in his courteous, good-humored way, and gone
                     in his carriage to attend a meeting of his brother magistrates:—I am away for
                     the time<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6523-00000008"/> from my noisy courts—the
                     domain is mine—all the world is still!</p>
                  <p>No;—Annie is singing in the hall.</p>
                  <p>She sings to herself, I think, this autumn morning, and would not like to be
                     interrupted. I will therefore take a ramble—and you shall accompany me, O
                     friend of my youth, far away in distant lands, but beside me still! Whither
                     shall we go? It is hard to decide, for all the world is lovely. Shall we go to
                     my favorite woodland? It skirts the river, and I love the river; so we pass
                     into the forest.</p>
                  <p>How regal is the time of the fall of the leaves! A thousand brilliant colors
                     charm the eyes—the eyes of their faithful lovers. How the mighty oaks reach out
                     their knotty, muscular arms to welcome us!—how their ponderous shoulders bear
                     aloft the imperial trappings—trappings of silk and velvet, all orange, blue,
                     and purple! The haughty pines stand up like warriors—or call them spears of
                     nordland heroes, holding on their summits emerald banners! The tulip-trees are
                     lovely queens with flowers in their hair, who bend and welcome you with
                     gracious murmurs; the slender elms sway to and fro, like fairest maidens of the
                     royal blood; and sigh, and smile, and whisper, full of the charming grace of
                     youth, and tenderness, and beauty.</p>
                  <p>I salute my noblemen, and queens, and princesses; they bow in return to me,
                     their king. Let us wander on.</p>
                  <p>——Ah! that is well; my river view! Of all my broad domain, I think I like this
                     part the best. Is it not beautiful? That clump of dogwood, however, obstructs
                     the view somewhat; I must cut it down. Let us move a little to the right. Ah!
                     there it is! See my lovely river; surely you must admire my swan-like ships,
                     flying, with snowy canvass spread, before the fresh breeze. And see that
                     schooner breaking the little waves into foam. Is that a telescope which the
                     captain of my vessel points toward us? He salutes me, does he not? But I fear
                     the distance is too great; he could hardly recognize me. Still I shall bow—let
                     us not neglect the laws of courtesy.</p>
                  <p>My ship is sailing onward. In earlier days I had many barks which sailed from
                     shore; they were freighted with the richest goods, and made me very anxious. So
                     my argosies went sailing, but they never came again. One bore my poem, which I
                     thought would make me very celebrated, but the ship was lost. Another was to
                     bring me back a cargo of such beautiful things—things which make life
                     delightful to so many!—pearls, and silks, and wines, and gold-laced
                     suits—garters, rosettes, and<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6523-00000009"/> slips of
                     ribbon to be worn at the button-hole. This, too, was lost, and yet it did not
                     grieve me much. The third caused me more regret; I do not think I have yet
                     wholly recovered from its loss. It bore a maiden with sunny hair, and the
                     tenderest, sweetest eyes! She said she loved me—yes a thousand times! and I—I
                     loved her long and dearly. But the ship in which she sailed went down—the
                     strong, good ship, as I regarded it. She died thus,—did she not?—or is it true
                     that she was married to a richer suitor far away from me in foreign lands? . .
                     . . . These are foolish tears—let me not think of her with want of charity; she
                     was only a woman, and we men are often very weak. ONE over all, is alone great
                     and good. So, beautiful ship!—I say—that sailed across my path in youth, sail
                     on in peace and happiness! A lonely bark, lonely but not unhappy, sees you, on
                     the distant, happy seas, and the pennon floats from the peak in amicable
                     greeting and salute. Hail and farewell! Heaven send the ship a happy voyage,
                     and a welcome home!</p>
                  <p>This little soliloquy perhaps wearies you; it is ended. Let us sail for an hour
                     or so on the silver wave; my new pleasure-boat is rocking here beneath in the
                     shadow of the oak. She is built for speed. See how gracefully she falls and
                     rises, like a variegated leaf upon the waves—how the slender prow curves
                     upward—how the gaily-colored sides are mirrored in the limpid surface of the
                     joyous stream! Come, let us step into the little craft, and unfurl the snowy
                     sail . . . . How provoking! I have left my boat key at the hall; another day we
                     will sail. Let us stroll back to the good old house again.</p>
                  <p>Are not my fields pleasant to behold? They are bringing in my wheat, which
                     stretches, you perceive, throughout the low-grounds there, in neatly arranged
                     shocks. My crops this year are excellent—my servants enjoy this season, and its
                     occupations. They will soon sing their echoing "harvest home"—and over them at
                     their joyous labor will shine the "harvest-moon," lighting up field and forest,
                     hill and dale—the whole "broad domain and the hall." The affection of my
                     servants is grateful to me. Here comes Cato, with his team of patient oxen, and
                     there goes Cæsar, leading my favorite racehorse down to water. Cato, Cæsar, and
                     I, respectively salute each other in the kindest way. I think they are attached
                     to me. Faithful fellows! I shall never part with them. I think I will give this
                     coat to Cæsar; but, looking again, I perceive that his own is better. Besides,
                     I must not be extravagant. The little money I make is required<pb n="18-19"
                        xml:id="VAC6523-00000010"/> by another, and it would not be generous to buy
                     a new coat for myself. This one which I wear will do well enough, will it not?
                     I ask you with some diffidence, for 'tis sadly out at elbows, and the idea has
                     occurred to me that the coolness and neglect of certain visitors to the hall,
                     has been caused by my coat being shabby. Even Annie ——, but I'll not speak of
                     that this morning. 'Twas the hasty word which we all utter at times—'tis
                     forgotten. Still, I think, I will give you the incident some day, when we
                     ramble, as now, in the fields.</p>
                  <p>From the fields we approach the honest old mansion, across the emerald-carpeted
                     lawn. The birds are singing, around the sleepy-looking gables, and the
                     toothless old hound comes wagging his tail, in sign of welcome.</p>
                  <p>'Tis plain that Milo has an honest heart. I think he's smiling.</p>

                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>My ancestors were gentlemen of considerable taste. I am glad they built me that
                     wing for my books; my numerous children cannot disturb me when I am composing,
                     either my speech to be delivered in the Senate, or my work which is destined to
                     refute Sir William Hamilton.</p>
                  <p>Let us stroll in. A strain of tender music comes from the sitting-room, and I
                     recognize the exquisite air of "Katharine Ogie" which Annie is singing. Let us
                     look, nevertheless, at the pictures as we pass.</p>
                  <p>What a stately head my old grandfather had! He was president of the King's
                     Council, a hundred years ago—a man of decided mark. He wears a long peruke
                     descending in curls upon his shoulders—a gold-laced waistcoat—and snowy
                     ruffles. His white hand is nearly covered with lace, and rests on a scroll of
                     parchment. It looks like a Vandyke. He must have been a resolute old gentleman.
                     How serene and calm is his look!—how firm are the finely chiselled lips! How
                     proud and full of collected intelligence the erect head, and the broad white
                     brow! He was a famous "macaroni," as they called it, in his youth—and
                     cultivated an enormous crop of wild oats. But this all disappeared, and he
                     became one of the sturdiest patriots of the Revolution, and fought clear
                     through the contest. Is it wrong to feel satisfaction at being descended from a
                     worthy race of men—from a family of brave, truthful gentlemen? I think not. I
                     trust I'm no absurd aristocrat—but I would rather be the grandson of a faithful
                     common soldier than of General Benedict Arnold, the traitor. I<pb n="20-21"
                        xml:id="VAC6523-00000011"/> would rather trace my lineage to the Chevalier
                     Bayàrd, simple knight though he was, than to France's great Constable de
                     Bourbon, the renegade.</p>
                  <p>So I am glad my stout grandfather was a brave and truthful gentleman—that
                     grandma yonder, smiling opposite, was worthy to be his wife. I do not remember
                     her, but she must have been a beauty. Her head is bent over one shoulder, and
                     she has an exquisitely coquettish air. Her eyes are blue—her arms round, and as
                     white as snow—and what lips! They are like carnations, and pout with a pretty
                     smiling air, which must have made her dangerous. She rejected many wealthy
                     offers to marry grandpa, who was then poor. As I gaze, it seems scarcely
                     courteous to remain thus covered in presence of a lady so lovely. I take off my
                     hat, and make my best bow, saluting my little grandmamma of "sweet seventeen,"
                     who smiles and seems graciously to bow in return.</p>
                  <p>All around me I see my family. There is my uncle, the captain in Colonel
                     Washington's troop. I do not now mean the Colonel Washington of the French
                     wars, who afterward became General Washington of the American Revolution—though
                     my uncle, the captain, knew him very well, I am told, and often visited him at
                        <emph>Mount Vernon,</emph> the colonel's estate, where they hunted foxes
                     together, along the Potomac. I mean the brave Colonel Washington who fought so
                     nobly in North Carolina. My uncle died there. His company was much thinned at
                     every step by the horrible hailstorm of balls. He was riding in front with his
                     drawn sword, shouting as the column fell, man by man, "Steady, boys,
                     steady!—close up!"—when a ball struck him. His last words were "A good death,
                     boys! a good death! Close up!" So, you see, he ended nobly.</p>
                  <p>Beside my uncle and the rest of his kith and kin of the wars, you see, yonder,
                     a row of beauties, all smiling and gay, or pensive and tender—interspersed with
                     bright-faced children, blooming like so many flowers along the old walls of the
                     hall. How they please and interest me! True, there are other portraits in our
                     little house at home—not my hall here—which, perhaps, I should love with a
                     warmer regard; but let me not cramp my sympathies, or indulge any early
                     preferences. I must not be partial. So I admire these here before me—and bow to
                     them, one and all. I fancy that they bow in return—that the stalwart warriors
                     stretch vigorous hands toward me—that the delicate beauties bend down their
                     little heads, all covered with powder, and return my homage with a smile.</p>
                  <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6523-00000012"/>
                  <p>Why not? Can my shabby coat make the lovely or proud faces ashamed of me? Do
                     they turn from me coldly because I'm the last of a ruined line? Do they sneer
                     at my napless hat, and laugh at my tattered elbows? I do not think of them so
                     poorly and unkindly. My coat is very shabby, but I think, at least I hope, that
                     it covers an honest heart.</p>
                  <p>So I bow to the noble and beautiful faces, and again they smile in return. I
                     seem to have wandered away into the past and dreamed in a realm of silence. And
                     yet—it is strange I did not hear her—Annie is still singing through the
                     hall.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>I promised to tell you of the incident of the coat, the unfortunate coat which
                     I sometimes think makes the rich folks visiting the hall look sidewise at me.
                     It is strange! Am I not <emph>myself,</emph> whether clad in velvet or in
                     fustian—in homespun fabric, or in cloth of gold? People say I am simple—whooly
                     ignorant of the world; I must be so in truth.</p>
                  <p>But about the coat. I hinted that Annie even saw, and alluded to it; it was not
                     long after my arrival at the hall, and a young lady from the neighborhood was
                     paying a visit a Annie.</p>
                  <p>They were standing on the portico, and I was leaning against the trunk of the
                     old oak beneath, admiring the sunset which was magnificent that evening. All at
                     once I heard whispers, and turning round toward the young ladies, saw them
                     laughing. Annie's finger was extended toward the hole in my elbow, and I could
                     not fail to understand that she was laughing at my miserable coat.</p>
                  <p>I was not offended, though perhaps I may have been slightly wounded; but Annie
                     was a young girl and I could not get angry; I was not at all ashamed—why should
                     I have been?</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry, but I cannot help the hole in my elbow," I said, calmly and
                     quietly, with a bow and a smile; "I tore it by accident, yesterday."</p>
                  <p>Annie blushed, and looked very proud and offended, and it pained me to see that
                     she suffered for her harmless and careless speech. I begged he not to think
                     that my feelings were wounded, and bowing again, went up to my room. I looked
                     at my coat, it <emph>was</emph> terribly shabby, and I revolved the propriety
                     of purchasing another, but I gave up the idea with a sigh. She needs all my
                     money, and my mind is made up; she <emph>shall</emph> have the black silk, and
                     very soon.</p>
                  <p>I very nearly forgot to relate what followed the little scene on the portico.
                     During all that evening<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6523-00000013"/> ing, and the
                     whole of the next day, Annie scarcely looked at me, and retained her angry and
                     offended expression. I was pained, but could add nothing more to my former
                     assurance that I was not offended.</p>
                  <p>Toward evening, I was sitting with a book upon the portico, when Annie came out
                     of the parlor. She paused on the threshold, evidently hesitated, but seemed to
                     resolve all at once, what to do. She came quickly to my side, and holding out
                     her hand said frankly and kindly, with a little tremor in her voice, and a
                     faint rose-tint in the delicate cheeks:</p>
                  <p>"I did not mean to hurt your feelings, Mr. Cleave, indeed I did not, sir; my
                     speech was the thoughtless rudeness of a child. I am sorry, very sorry that I
                     was ever so ill-bred and unkind; will you pardon me, sir?"</p>
                  <p>I rose from my seat, and bowed low above the white little hand which lay in my
                     own, slightly agitated,—</p>
                  <p>"I have nothing to pardon, Miss Annie," I said, "if you will let me call you by
                     your household name. I think it very fortunate that my coat was shabby; had it
                     been a new one, you would never have observed it, and I should have lost these
                     sweet and friendly accents."</p>
                  <p>And that is the "incident of the coat."</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>IV.</head>
                  <p>The week that has just passed has been a pleasant one. I have thought, a
                     hundred times, "how good a thing it is to live!"</p>
                  <p>I must have been a good deal cramped and confined in the city; but I enjoy the
                     fair landscapes here all the more. The family are very friendly and kind—except
                     Mrs. Barrington, who does not seem to like me. She scarcely treats me with
                     anything more than scrupulous courtesy. The squire and Annie, however, make up
                     for this coldness. They are both extremely cordial. It was friendly in the
                     squire to give me this mass of executorial accounts to arrange. So far it has
                     been done to his entire satisfaction; and the payment for my services is very
                     liberal. How I long for money!</p>
                  <p>There was a spendid party at the hall on Tuesday. It reminded me of old times,
                     when we, too,——but that is idle to remember. I do not sigh for the past. I know
                     all is for the best. Still, I could not help thinking, as I looked on the
                     brilliant spectacle, that the world was full of changes and vicissitudes. Well,
                     the party was a gay and delightful one; the dancing quite extravagant. Annie
                     was the beauty of the assemblage the belle<pb n="26-27"
                        xml:id="VAC6523-00000014"/> of the ball—and she gave me a new proof of the
                     regret which she felt for the speech about my coat. At the end of a cotillon
                     she refused the arms of half a dozen eager gallants to take mine, and promenade
                     out on the portico.</p>
                  <p>"Do you ever dance?" she said.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes," I replied; "that is, I did dance once; but of late years I have been
                     too much occupied. We live quietly."</p>
                  <p>"You say 'we.'"</p>
                  <p>"I mean my mother and I; I should have said 'poorly,' perhaps, instead of
                     'quietly.' And I am busy."</p>
                  <p>She bowed her head kindly, and said, smiling:</p>
                  <p>"But you are not busy to-night; and if you'll not think me forward, I will
                     reverse the etiquette, and ask you to dance with me."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed I will do so with very great pleasure."</p>
                  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>
                  <p>"Could you doubt it?"</p>
                  <p>"I was so <emph>very</emph> rude to you!"</p>
                  <p>And she hung her head. That, then, was the secret of her choice of my arm. I
                     could only assure her that I did not think her rude, and I hoped she would
                     forget the whole incident. I was pleased in spite of all—for I like to think
                     well of women. The cynical writers say they are all mean, and mercenary, and
                     cowardly. Was Annie? She had left many finely-dressed gentlemen, faultlessly
                     appointed, to dance with a poor stranger, quite out at elbows.</p>
                  <p>I saw many cold looks directed at myself; and when Annie took my arm to go into
                     supper, the gloom in the faces of some gentlemen who had been refused, made me
                     smile. When the party was over, Annie gave me her hand at the foot of the
                     staircase. I saw a triumphant light in her mischievous eyes, as she glanced at
                     the departing gallants; her rosy cheeks dimpled, and she flitted up, humming a
                     gay tune.</p>
                  <p>It is singular how beautiful she is when she laughs—as when she sighs. Am I
                     falling in love with her? I shall be guilty of no such folly. I think that my
                     pride and self-respect will keep me rational. Pshaw! why did I dream of such
                     nonsense!</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>V.</head>
                  <p>So—a month has passed.</p>
                  <p>My coat, it seems, is to be the constant topic of attention.</p>
                  <p>A day or two since, I was sitting in my chamber,<pb n="28-29"
                        xml:id="VAC6523-00000015"/> reflecting upon a variety of things. My
                     thoughts, at last, centred on the deficiencies of my wardrobe, and I muttered,
                     "I must certainly have my coat mended soon;" and I looked down, sighing, at the
                     hole in my elbow. . . . . . . . It had disappeared! There was no longer any
                     rent. The torn cloth had been mended in the neatest manner; so neatly, indeed,
                     that the orifice was almost invisible. Who could have done it, and how? I have
                     one coat only, and——yes! it must have been! I saw, in a moment, the whole
                     secret: that noise, and the voice of Sarah, the old chambermaid.</p>
                  <p>I rose and went out on the staircase; I met the good crone.</p>
                  <p>"How did you find my coat in the dark?" I said, smiling; "and now you must let
                     me make you a present for mending it, Sarah."</p>
                  <p>Sarah hesitated, plainly; but honesty conquered. She refused the money, which,
                     nevertheless, I gave her; and, from her careless replies, I soon discovered the
                     real truth.</p>
                  <p>The coat had been mended by Annie!</p>
                  <p>I descended to the drawing-room, and finding her alone, thanked her with
                     simplicity and sincerity. She blushed and pouted.</p>
                  <p>"Who told you?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"No one; but I discovered it from Sarah; she was unguarded."</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir," said Annie, blushing still, but laughing, "there is no reason for
                     your being so grateful. I thought I would mend it, as I formerly laughed at
                     it—and I hope it is neatly done."</p>
                  <p>"It is scarcely visible," I said, with a smile and a bow; "I shall keep this
                     coat always to remind me of your delicate kindness."</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw! 'twas nothing."</p>
                  <p>And running to the piano, the young girl commenced a merry song, which rang
                     through the old hall like the carol of a bird. Her voice was so inexpressibly
                     sweet that it made my pulses throb and my heart ache. I did not know the
                     expression of my countenance, as I looked at her, until turning toward me, I
                     saw her suddenly color to the roots of her hair.</p>
                  <p>I felt, all at once, that I had fixed upon her one of those looks which say as
                     plainly as words could utter: "I love you with all the powers of my nature, all
                     the faculties of my being—you are dearer to me than the whole wide world
                     beside!"</p>
                  <p>Upon my word of honor as a gentleman, I did not know that I loved Annie—I was
                     not conscious that I was gazing at her with that look of inexpressible
                     tenderness. Her sudden blush cleared up<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6523-00000016"
                     /> everything like a flash of lightning—I rose, set my lips together, and
                     bowed. I could scarcely speak—I muttered "pray excuse me," and left the
                     apartment.</p>
                  <p>On the next morning I begged the squire to release me from the completion of my
                     task—I had a friend who could perform the duties as well as myself, and who
                     would come to the hall for that purpose, inasmuch as the account books could
                     not be removed—I must go.</p>
                  <p>The formal and ceremonious old gentleman did not ask my reasons for this sudden
                     act—he simply inclined his head—and said that he would always be glad to serve
                     me. With a momentary pressure of Annie's cold hand, and a low bow to the frigid
                     Mrs. Barrington, I departed.</p>

                  <p>Five years have passed away. They have been eventful ones to me—not for the
                     unhoped for success which I have had in my profession, so much as for the long
                     suffering which drove me, violently as it were, to seek relief in unceasing
                     toil.</p>
                  <p>The thought of Annie has been ever with me—my pain, though such a term is
                     slight, was caused by my leaving her. I never knew how much I loved her until
                     all those weary miles were thrown between us. My days have been most unhappy,
                     my nights drearier still; for a long time now, I have not thought or said "how
                     good a thing it is to live!"</p>
                  <p>But I acted wisely, and honorably; did I not? I did my duty, when the
                     temptation to neglect it was exceeding hard to resist. I went away from the
                     woman whom I loved, because I loved her, and respected my own name and honor,
                     too much to remain. It was better to break my heart, I said, than take
                     advantage of my position at the hall, to engage a young girl's heart, and drag
                     her down, in case she loved me, to the poor low sphere in which I moved. If her
                     father had said to me, "You have abused the trust I placed in you, and acted
                     with duplicity," I think it would have ruined me, forever, in my own esteem.
                     And would he not have had the right to say it?</p>
                  <p>So I came away from the temptation while I could, and plunged into my proper
                     work on earth, and found relief; but I loved her still.</p>
                  <p>Shall I speak of the correspondence which ensued between the squire and myself?
                     'Twas a somewhat singular one, and revealed to me something which I was before
                     quite ignorant of. It is here beneath my hand; let us look at it. It passed
                     soon after my departure:</p>

                                 with some attention, and fear that it was occasioned by a want of
                                 kindness in myself, or some member of my family. I saw with regret
                                 that Mrs. Barrington did not seem to look upon you with as much
                                 favor as I hoped. If any word or action of mine has wounded you, I
                                 pray you to forget and pardon it.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>I need not say that I went at once. As I approached the old manor house a
                     thousand memories knocked at the door of my heart. There were the fields over
                     which I had rambled; there was the emerald lawn where so often I had wandered
                     in the long-gone days of earlier years. The great oak against which I had
                     leaned on that evening to watch the sun in his setting, and where Annie had
                     whispered and pointed to my torn elbow, still raised its head proudly, and
                     embowered the old gables in the bright-tinted foliage of autumn.</p>
                  <p>I entered. The old portraits I had loved seemed to smile; they saluted me
                     sweetly, as in other hours; the old mansion appeared to welcome me—I saw no
                     change, but Annie was not singing in the hall.</p>
                  <p>All at once I heard a light tinkling footstep; my heart beat violently, and I
                     felt a blush rise to my cheeks. Was the queenly woman who came to meet and
                     greet me, indeed the Annie of old days? I held the small hand, and looked into
                     the deep eyes for some moments without uttering a word. She was taller, more
                     slender, but her carriage possessed a grace and elegance a thousand times finer
                     than before. Her eyes were filled with the strangest sweetness, and swam with
                     tears as she gazed at me.</p>
                  <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6523-00000018"/>
                  <p>"Papa has been waiting impatiently for you, Mr. Cleave," she said, in a low,
                     sad voice; "will you come up and see him at once? he is very ill."</p>
                  <p>And turning away her head, the fair girl burst into uncontrollable sobs, every
                     one of which went to my heart. I begged her earnestly not to yield to her
                     distress, and she soon dried her eyes, and led the way into the parlor, where I
                     was received by Mrs. Barrington, still cold and stiff, but much more subdued
                     and courteous. Annie went to announce my arrival to har father, and soon I was
                     alone with the old man.</p>
                  <p>I was grieved and shocked at his appearance. He seemed twenty years older. I
                     scarcely recognized in the pale, thin, invalid, the portly country gentleman
                     whom I had known.</p>
                  <p>The motive for his letter was soon explained. The executorial accounts, whose
                     terrible disarrangement I had aided, five years before, in remedying, still
                     hung over the dying man's head, like a nightmare. He could not die, he said,
                     with the thought in his mind, that any one might attribute this disorder to
                     intentional maladministration—"to fraud, it might be."</p>
                  <p>And at the word "fraud," his wan cheek became crimson.</p>
                  <p>"My own affairs, Mr. Cleave," he continued, "are, I find, in a most unhappy
                     condition. I have been far too negligent; and now, on my death-bed, for such it
                     will prove, I discover, for the first time, that I am well-nigh a ruined
                     man!"</p>
                  <p>He spoke with wild energy as he went on. I, in vain, attempted to impress upon
                     him, the danger of exciting himself.</p>
                  <p>"I must explain everything, and in my own way," he said, with burning cheeks,
                     "for I look to you to extricate me. I have appointed you, Mr. Cleave, my chief
                     executor; but, above all, I rely upon you, I adjure you, to protect my good
                     name in those horrible accounts, which you once helped to arrange, but which
                     haunt me day and night like the ghost of a murdered man!"</p>
                  <p>The insane agitation of the speaker increased, in spite of all which I could
                     say. It led him to make me a singular revelation—to speak upon a subject which
                     I had never even dreamed of. His pride and caution seemed wholly to have
                     deserted him; and he continued as follows:</p>
                  <p>"You are surprised, Sir, that I should thus call upon you. You are young. But I
                     know very well what I am doing. Your rank in your profession is sufficient
                     guaranty that you are competent to perform the trust—my knowledge of your
                     character is correct enough to induce me not to hesitate.<pb n="36-37"
                        xml:id="VAC6523-00000019"/> There is another tie between us. Do you suspect
                     its nature? I loved and would have married your mother. She was poor—I was
                     equally poor—I was dazzled by wealth, and was miserably happy when your
                     mother's pride made her refuse my suit. I married—I have not been happy. But
                     enough. I should never have spoken of this—never—but I am dying! As you are
                     faithful and true, St. George Cleave, let my good name and Annie's be
                     untarnished!"</p>
                  <p>There the interview ended. The doctor came in, and I retired to reflect upon
                     the singular communication which had been made to me. On the same evening, I
                     accepted all the trusts confided to me. In a week the sick gentleman was
                     sleeping with his fathers. I held his hand when he died.</p>
                  <p>I shall not describe the grief and suffering of every one. I shall not trust
                     myself, especially, to speak of Annie. Her agony was almost destructive to her
                     health—and every throb which shook her frame, shook mine as well. The sight of
                     her face had revived, in an instant, all the love of the past, if indeed it had
                     ever slept. I loved her now, passionately, profoundly. As I thought that I
                     might win her love in return, I thrilled with a vague delight.</p>
                  <p>Well, let me not spin out my story. The result of my examination of Mr.
                     Barrington's affairs, was saddening in the extreme. He was quite ruined.
                     Neglect and extravagant living, with security debts, had mortgaged his entire
                     property. When it was settled, and the hall was sold, his widow and daughter
                     had just enough to live upon comfortably—scarcely so much. They gladly embraced
                     my suggestion to remove to a small cottage near our own, in town, and there
                     they now live—you may see the low roof through the window.</p>
                  <p>I am glad to say that my reëxamination of the executorial accounts, which had
                     so troubled the poor dying gentleman, proved his fears quite unfounded. There
                     was mere disorder—no grounds for "exception." I told as much to Annie, who
                     alone knew all; and her smile, inexpressibly sweet and filled with thanks, was
                     my sole executorial "commission."</p>

                  <p>I have just been discarded by Annie.</p>
                  <p>Let me endeavor to collect my thoughts and recall what she said to me. My head
                     is troubled to-day—it is strange what a want of self-control I have! I thought
                     I was strong—and I am weaker than a child.</p>
                  <p>I told her that I loved her—had loved her for<pb n="38-39"
                        xml:id="VAC6523-00000020"/> years—that she was dearer, far, to me than all
                     on earth beside my mother. And she answered me—agitated, but perfectly
                     resolved:</p>
                  <p>"I cannot marry you, Mr. Cleave."</p>
                  <p>A long pause followed, in which she evidently labored with great distress—then
                     she continued:</p>
                  <p>"I will frankly and faithfully say <emph>why</emph> I cannot. I know all—I know
                     your feelings for me once. You went away because you were poor, and you thought
                     I was rich. Shall I be less strong than yourself? I am poor now; I do not
                     regret it, except—pardon me, sir, I am confused—I meant to say, that
                        <emph>you</emph> are now the richer. It humbles me to speak of this—why did
                     you not"——</p>
                  <p>There she stopped, blushing and trembling.</p>
                  <p>"Why did I not? Oh! do not stop there, I pray you."</p>
                  <p>She replied to my words in a broken and agitated voice:</p>
                  <p>"I cannot finish. I was thinking of—of—the day when I mended your coat!"</p>
                  <p>And a smile broke through the tears in her eyes, as she gazed timidly at me. I
                     shall not prolong the account of our interview. She soon left me, resolute to
                     the last; and I came away, perfectly miserable.</p>
                  <p>What shall I do? I cannot live without her.</p>
                  <p>My life would be a miserable mockery. To see her there near me, at the window,
                     in the street; to see her tresses in the sunlight, her little slipper as it
                     flits through the flower-enveloped gate; to feel that she is near me, but lost
                     to me! Never could I endure it! But what can I do? Is there anything that can
                     move her?</p>
                  <p>——Ah! that may! Let me try it. Oh, fortunate accident. To-morrow, or very
                     soon—very soon!</p>

                  <p>A week after my rejection, I went up to my chamber, and drew from the depths of
                     my wardrobe, the old coat which Annie had mended. I had promised her to
                     preserve it. I had kept my promise. Yes, there it was, just as I had worn it at
                     the hall—my shabby old coat of five years ago! I put it on, smiling, and
                     surveyed myself in a mirror. It was strangely old-fashioned; but I did not
                     think of that. I seemed to have returned, all at once, to the past; its
                     atmosphere embraced me; all its flowers bloomed gaily before my eyes.</p>
                  <p>I looked at the hole in the elbow. There were<pb n="40-41"
                        xml:id="VAC6523-00000021"/> Annie's stitches—her fingers had clasped the
                     worn, decayed cloth—the old garment had rested on her arm!</p>
                  <p>I think I must have gazed at the coat for an hour, motionless in the sunlight,
                     and thinking of old days. Then I aroused myself, suddenly, put on my hat, and,
                     with a beating heart, went to ask if Annie remembered.</p>
                  <p>I shall not relate the details of our interview. She remembered! Oh, word so
                     sweet or so filled with sadness! with a world of sorrow or delight in its
                     sound! She remembered—and her heart could resist no longer. She remembered the
                     poor youth who had loved her so dearly—whom she, too, had loved in the far away
                     past. She remembered the days when her father was well and happy—when his kind
                     voice greeted me, and his smile gave me friendly welcome. She remembered the
                     old days, with their flowers and sunshine—the old hall, and the lawn, and the
                     singing birds. Can you wonder that her soft, tender bosom throbbed, that her
                     heart was "melted in her breast?"</p>
                  <p>So she plighted me her troth—the dream and joy of my youth. We shall very soon
                     be married. The ship which I sent from the shore long ago has come again to
                     port, with a grander treasure than the earth holds beside—it is the precious,
                     young head which reclined upon my heart!</p>
                  <p>——And again I can say, as I said long ago: "how good a thing it is to
                     live!"</p>

               <head>A LEAF FROM MY PARIS NOTE-BOOK.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY H. T. TUCKERMAN.</head>
               <p>FRESH from Italy, we enter the gallery of the Louvre with a feeling that it is but
                  a grand prolongation of the glorious array of pictured and sculptured trophies,
                  scattered in such memorable luxuriance, through that chosen land of art; but the
                  sensation is that of delightful surprise when we have but recently explored the
                  dim chambers of the National Gallery, or obtained formal access to a private
                  British collection. To cross the now magnificent hall of Apollo, with its grand
                  proportions flooded by a cloudless sun, expands the mind and brightens the vision
                  for their feast of beauty. Here too, a magic improvement has been recently
                  wrought, and the architectural renovation lends new effect to the ancient
                  treasures, so admirably preserved and arranged. I stood long at one of the windows
                  and looked down upon the Seine: it was thence that the people were fired upon at
                  the massacre of St. Bartholomew; there rose, dark and fretted, the antique tower
                  of Notre Dame, here was the site of the Tour de Nesle, that legend of crime
                  wrought in stone; gracefully looked the bridges as they spanned the swollen
                  current of the river; cheerfully lay the sunshine on quay and parapet; it was a
                  scene where the glow of nature and the shadows of history unite to lend a charm to
                  the panorama of modern civilization. And turning the gaze within, how calm and
                  refreshing seemed the long and high vistas of the gallery; how happy the artists
                  at their easels;—girls with their frugal dinners in a basket on the pavement,
                  copying a Flemish scene; youths drawing intently some head of an old master;
                  veterans of the palette reproducing the tints born under Venetian skies; and
                  groups standing in silent admiration before some exquisite gem or wonderful
                  conception. It is like an audience with the peers of art to range the Louvre; in
                  radiant state and majestic silence they receive their reverend guests; first
                  smiles down upon him the celestial meekness of Raphael's holy women, then the
                  rustic truth of Murillo's peasant mothers, and the most costly, though, to our
                  mind, not the most expressive, of all his pictures—the late acquisition for which
                  kings competed at Marshal Soult's sale; now we are<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000024"/> warmed by the rosy flush of Rubens—like a mellow
                  sunset beaming from the walls; and now startled at the life-like individuality of
                  Vandyke's portraits, as they gaze down with such placid dignity and keen
                  intelligence; at one point, we examine with mere curiosity the stiff outlines of
                  early religious limning; and, at another, smile at the homely nature of the Dutch
                  school; Philip de Champagne's portraits, Wouverman's white horses, Cuyp's meadows
                  and kine, Steen's rural <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fêtes,</foreign> Claude's sunsets,
                  Pannini's architecture and Sneyder's animals; David's melodramatic pieces,
                  Isabey's miniatures, Oudny's dogs, Robert's "Harvest Home," all hint a chapter,
                  not only in the history of art, but in the philosophy of life and the secrets of
                  the beautiful—enshrined there for the world's enjoyment, with a liberal policy yet
                  more aptly illustrated by the vast and lofty colonnades, the courteous custodes,
                  and the provisions for students in the drawings of successive schools.</p>
               <p>In order to exchange the fascinations of the moment for the lessons of the past,
                  one cloudy morning we drove through the avenue of the Champs Elysées, by the
                  triumphal arch of Napoleon, to the palace of St. Cloud, and from the esplanade
                  gazed back upon the city, over the plain below, to the dense mass of buildings
                  surmounted by the domes of the Invalids, and the Pantheon and the towers of Notre
                  Dame. To the eye of contemplation it is one of the most memorable of landscapes; a
                  stand-point for historical reverie, which attunes the mind for subsequent and less
                  discursive retrospection. Enter the apartment where Bonaparte dispersed the
                  assembly of five hundred—the initatory act of his rule; it is now a conservatory,
                  whence rising terrace walks, statues and fountains only are visible; in the fresh
                  silence of morning, they offered a striking contrast to that eventful scene. In an
                  adjacent room a picture representing Maria de Medici's interview with Sully after
                  the death of Henry IV., carries us back to an earlier era. Here Blucher had his
                  headquarters, and here was settled the convention by which Paris was yielded to
                  the allies. The saloon of Vernet, the well-trimmed vine-trees of the garden, the
                  vivid hues of the tapestry, the newly waxed floors, the hangings and couches of
                  Lyons silk, the elegant Sèvres vases, and Florentine tables of <foreign
                     xml:lang="ITA">pietra dura,</foreign> the velvet cushions of the chapel, and
                  late publications on the library desks—all free of speck or stain—proclaim this
                  summer palace as great a favorite now as when resorted to by the princes of
                  Orleans. In this hall the two Napoleons were proclaimed; and the brilliant memory
                  of those summer festivals that lately made St. Cloud dazzling with light and
                  beauty, was<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6523-00000025"/> reflected from mirror,
                  cornice, and tinted fabric; from this gilt on the iron chain of usurped dominion,
                  a glance through the window revealed its origin: a throng of people were on their
                  way to mass and a regiment was on parade—the one illustrating the blind exaction
                  of bigoted authority, the other the machinery of brute force—the church and the
                  army, the mitre and the sword, superstition and violence; with these, in all ages,
                  have the multitude been subdued; and between these two representations of
                  elemental despotism, clustered on a high wall, stood a crowd to watch the meek
                  procession of worshippers, and the exactitude of the manual, or admire the
                  spirited, yet controlled, evolutions of the officer on his noble charger. The
                  whole scene typified France as she is; uneducated devotees, a military
                  organization at the beck of its chief, and a surplus of curious, intimidated or
                  acquiescent spectators.</p>
               <p>To pass from St. Cloud to Versailles is like turning from the last to the first
                  chapters of French history. The vast court of the palace is lined with colossal
                  statues; and thus we enter the vestibule through a file of pale and majestic
                  sentinels, summoned, as it were, from the tomb to guard the trophies of
                  nationality. Our pilgrimage through such a world of effigies begins with Clovis
                  and Charlemagne, and ends with Louis Philippe: the place itself is the ancient
                  home of royalty; the gardens, visible from every window, have been trod by
                  generations of monarchs and courtiers; the ceilings bear the arms of the noble
                  families of the kingdom; while around are the faces and figures of the men of
                  valor and of genius that consecrate her history. Through this panorama move
                  peasants, workmen, citizens, and foreigners, gazing unrestricted, as upon a
                  procession evoked from the inexorable past, in which are all those of whom they
                  have heard or read as illustrious in France; they see the battles, the leaders,
                  the kings, the poets, the human material of history. This grand conception, which
                  has of late years been mainly realized by the last king, is certainly one of the
                  most grand and significant of modern times. Even in this, our one day's
                  observation, how many ideas are revived, how many characters brought into view;
                  what events, associations and people throng upon our consciousness, as slowly
                  gazing, we tread the interminable halls and scan the countless memorials of
                  Versailles!</p>
               <p>Taking up the thread of reminiscence when looking at the old moldy mortar that
                  belonged to the knights of St. John when at Rhodes, the expiring chivalry of
                  Europe gleams fitfully upon us, once more, to provoke a mortifying comparison with
                     the<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6523-00000026"/> not yet completed pictures of the
                  capture of Abd-el-Kader and the last siege of Rome; thence turn to the "Jeu de
                  Paume," where the ardent figure of Mirabeau represents the genius of the
                  Revolution, and from it to "Louis XVIII. and the Charter," emblematic of the
                  Restoration; how shines on this canvas the "helmet of Navarre" in the "Battle of
                  Ivry," as in Macaulay's spirited lyric, and chastely beautiful in its stainless
                  marble, stands the heroic Maid of Orleans; while, appropriately in the midst of
                  these historic characters, we find the bust of that ideal of picturesque
                  narrators, Froissart. The modern rule of France is abruptly and almost grotesquely
                  suggested amid such associations, by the figure of De Joinville on the deck of a
                  man-of-war, well described by Talfourd, as "the type of dandified, melodramatic
                  seamanship." The cycles of kingly sway is abruptly broken by the meteoric episode
                  of Bonaparte: first he appears dispersing the Assembly, and then in his early
                  victories, wounded at Ratisbon, at the tomb of Frederick the Great, distributing
                  the Legion of Honor at the Invalides, quelling an insurrection at Cairo, engaged
                  in his unparalleled succession of battles, and at the altar with Maria Louisa. The
                  divorce from Josephine and the murder of the Due D'Enghien, are events that only
                  recur more impressively to the mind of the spectator because uncommemorated. From
                  the career of military genius which transformed the destinies of France, we pass
                  to apartments where still breathes the vestiges of legitimacy as in the hour of
                  its prime. The equestrian statue of Louis XIV. in the courtyard, his bed and
                  crown, his clock and chair in the long suite of rooms kept sacred to his memory,
                  typify the age when genius and beauty mingled their charms in the corrupt
                  atmosphere of intrigue and profligacy. The noble expanse of wood, water, and
                  meadow; the paths lined with stately myrtles and ancient box, spread as invitingly
                  to the eye from this embayed window, as when the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">grand
                     monarque</foreign> stood there to watch the graceful walk of La Vallière, or
                  the staid carriage of Maintenon. The abandonment and quietude of these chambers,
                  mirrored, tapestried, and solitary, owe not a little of the spell they exercise
                  over the imagination, to the vicinity of the galleries devoted to the men of the
                  Revolution and the campaigns of '92; amid the smoke of conflict ever appears that
                  resolute, olive face with the dark eye fixed and the thin lip curved in decision
                  or expectancy. We mechanically repeat Campbell's elegy as we mark "Hohenlinden,"
                  and linger with patriotic gratitude over "Yorktown," notwithstanding the absurd<pb
                     n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6523-00000027"/> prominence given to the French officers;
                  Condé, Turenne, Moreau, Lannes, Massena, and Lafayette fight over again before us
                  the wars of the Fronde, the Empire, or the Republic. The monotony of these scenes
                  of destruction is only relieved by the individual memories of the chiefs; they
                  link a certain individuality with the flame and shroud of war, the fragmentary
                  conquests, and the struggles that make up so large a portion of external history;
                  and we emerge from the crowd of warriors into the company of statesmen, wits, and
                  poets, with a sensation of refreshment. Each single triumph of thought, each
                  victory of imagination and memorial of character, has an absolute worth and charm
                  that the exploits of armies can never emulate.</p>
               <p>Racine's portrait revives the long controversy between the classic and romantic
                  schools; that of La Bruy re the art of character-painting now one of the highest
                  functions of popular literature; that of Bossuet the pulpit eloquence of France
                  and the persecution of Fénelon, and that of Saint Cyr the Jansenist discussion. A
                  blank like that which designates the place of Marino Faliero in the Ducal palace
                  at Venice, is left here for Le Sage, as the nativity of the author of Gil Blas is
                  yet disputed. We look at Rousseau to revert to the social reforms, of which he was
                  the pioneer; at La Place to realize the achievements of the exact sciences, and at
                  St. Pierre to remember the poetry of nature. Voltaire's likeness is not labelled
                  for the same reason that there is no name on the tomb of Ney; both are too well
                  known to require announcement How incongruous become the associations as we
                  proceed; old Père la Chaise cheek by jowl with the American Presidents;
                  Cagliostro, who died before the word his career incarnated had become
                  indispensable to the English tongue—the apotheosis of humbug; Marmontel, dear to
                  our novitiate as novel readers; and near by the original Pamela; Chateaubriand's
                  ancestor the Marshal; Bisson going below to ignite the magazine, rather than "give
                  up the ship;" and the battered war dog, with a single eye and leg, beneath whose
                  fragmentary portrait is inscribed that Mars left him only a heart.</p>
               <p>It is with singular interest that we look upon the authentic resemblance of
                  persons with whose minds and career literature has made us familiar, and compare
                  what we have imagined of their appearance with the reality. Of such characters as
                  Gluck, Klopstock and Madame Le Brun, whose ministry of art has excited a vague
                  delight, we may have formed no very distinct image; but associated as is the name
                  of Madame Roland with courage, suffering and affliction, we naturally expect a
                     more<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6523-00000028"/> dignified and less vivacious
                  expression than here meets us, until we remember the earlier development of her
                  rare and sympathetic intelligence. Count Mirabeau has a look of mildness and
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sang froid</foreign> instead of the earnestness we
                  fancied. Who would have supposed the fair assassin of Marat such a thin, delicate
                  and spirituelle blonde? The sensuous face of George IV. and the tragic one of
                  Charles I., in the ever recurring Vandyke, with Sheridan's confident, handsome and
                  genial physiognomy, seem grouped to make more elevated, by comparison, the noble
                  abstraction of Flaxman. Talleyrand resembles a keen, selfish, humorous and
                  gentlemanly man of the world, in an unexceptionable white wig. Richelieu is
                  piquant and Madame de Staël impassioned and Amazonian. What decadence even in the
                  warlike notabilities is hinted by glancing from Soult to Oudinot! I thought of the
                  French fleet in the memorable storm off Newport, as I recognized the portrait of
                  the Count d'Estaing; and realized anew the military instinct of the nation in the
                  preponderance of battle-scenes and heroes, and marked the interest with which
                  groups of soldiers lingered and talked before them.</p>

               <head>ON POPULAR KNOWLEDGE.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY GEORGE S. HILLARD.</head>
               <p>AGAINST all institutions for the diffusion of knowledge among the community, an
                  objection is often urged that they can teach nothing thoroughly, but only
                  superficially, and that modest ignorance is better than presumptuous
                  half-knowledge. How frequently is it said that "a little learning is a dangerous
                  thing." This celebrated line is a striking instance of the vitality which may be
                  given to what is at least a very doubtful proposition by throwing it into a
                  pointed form. If anything be a good at all, it is a good precisely in proportion
                  to the extent in which it is possessed or enjoyed. A great deal of it is better
                  than a little, but a little is better than none. No one says or thinks that a
                  little conscience, or a little wisdom, or a little faith, or a little charity is a
                  dangerous thing. Why then is a little learning dangerous? Alas, it is not the
                  little learning, but the much ignorance which it supposes, that is dangerous!</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6523-00000030"/>
               <p>We also frequently hear it said, that the general diffusion of popular knowledge
                  is unfavorable to great acquisitions in any one individual. This is a favorite
                  dogma with those persons whose views are all retrospective, who are ever
                  magnifying past ages at the expense of the present, and who will insist upon
                  riding through life with their faces turned toward the horse's tail instead of his
                  head. "We have smatterers and sciolists in abundance," say they, "but where are
                  the giant scholars of other days?" Dr. Johnson once said, in reply to a remark
                  upon the general intelligence of the people of Scotland, that learning in Scotland
                  was like bread in a besieged city, where every man gets a mouthful, but none a
                  full meal. He also observed in a conversation held with Lord Monboddo, that
                  learning had much decreased in England, since his remembrance; to which his
                  lordship remarked, "you have lived to see its decrease in England; I, its
                  extinction in Scotland." The fallacy of views like these consists in taking it for
                  granted that there is always just about the same aggregate amount of knowledge in
                  the world, and that only the ratio of distribution is changed. But there is no
                  such analogy between learning and material substances. The wealth of the mind is
                  not like gold, which must be beaten out the finer, as the surface to be covered by
                  it is more extensive. As to the alleged superiority of past ages, in anything
                  essential, I am more than skeptical. I hold rather that of all good things,
                  learning included, there is as much in the world now as there ever was—not to say
                  more. The great scholars of Europe in our time are not inferior to the greatest of
                  their predecessors. Even in classical literature and antiquities, the searching,
                  analyzing and investigating spirit of our age has poured new light upon the remote
                  past, and rendered the labors of former generations useless By elevating the
                  general standard, it is true that there is less distance between the common mind
                  and the deeply learned. The scholars of the middle ages seem the higher, from the
                  low level of ignorance from which they rise. They are like mountains shooting
                  abruptly from the plain. Our scholars seem to have reached an inferior point of
                  elevation, because the level of the general mind has come nearer to them, as
                  mountain peaks lose somewhat of their apparent height when they spring from a
                  raised table land.</p>

               <head>THE PRINCE AT LAND'S END.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY CAROLINE CHESEBRO.</head>
               <p>LAST from the church came the organist, Daniel Summerman. He was less hurried than
                  others; to him it was not, as to people in general, a day of increased social
                  responsibility. His great duty was now performed. Done, whether well or ill. He
                  descended the stairs slowly, but with a step so light you might have taken it for
                  a child's. No need for him to haste; the precious moments would go fast enough—he
                  wished not to lose one.</p>
               <p>In the porch he paused a moment, to draw on his woollen gloves, and button his
                  great coat, and for something besides. Perhaps the person who laid the wreath of
                  cedar leaves on his organ stool was somewhere about, and had some criticism to
                  offer in respect to the choir's performance.</p>
               <p>But he descended the church steps without having met even the sexton; somewhat
                  disappointed, it was not with indifference that he saw a stranger standing in the
                  churchyard among the graves; by the grave, it chanced, of a child who died in
                  October, five years old. When the organist perceived this, a purpose which he
                  would have formed later in the day, anticipated itself, and led him to the little
                  mound. He would leave the cedar wreath on Mary's grave.</p>
               <p>He was not ashamed of his gracious purpose when he had drawn near. His gentle
                  heart was glad to do this homage to the dead, in the presence of a stranger who
                  had never seen the living child. Stooping down, he smoothed the frozen grass, and
                  laid the wreath upon it; and when he saw the stranger watching him, he said:</p>
               <p>"She was the prettiest child in the village; if she had lived, we should have had
                  one singer in the choir. I would have taught her. She loved music so much."</p>
               <p>Here was an introduction sufficient for an ordinary man. At least the organist
                  thought so. But when he looked at the stranger he was sorry that he had spoken,
                  for no genial sympathy was in that face, and still less in the voice that
                  asked,</p>
               <p>"Will you leave the wreath here? Where did it come from?"</p>
               <p>The organist replied as though he did not perceive the indifference with which the
                  questions were asked:</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6523-00000033"/>
               <p>"I found it in the choir," said he. "One of the children left it, may be. Any way
                  this is the best place for it. Dear little girl! I should hate to think that she
                  was really down there."</p>
               <p>"Where, then?" asked the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Up above, as sure as there's a heaven." As Summerman spoke, he stepped from the
                  frozen ground to the gravel walk, and turning his back on the stranger he brushed
                  a tear from his cheek.</p>
               <p>The gentleman, whose name was Redman Rush, followed him. He was a well-dressed
                  person; indeed, his attire was splendid, in comparison with the rough garments of
                  the little organist. His fine broadcloth cloak was trimmed profusely with rare
                  fur, and he wore a fur cap that must have cost half as much as the church paid
                  Summerman for playing the organ a twelvemonth. He was a noticeable person, not
                  merely on account of his dress. His bearing was elegant, that of a well-bred man,
                  not indifferent to the eyes of others; that of a man somewhat cautious of the
                  reflection he should cast in a region of shadows and appearances. But, moreover,
                  the face of this Redman Rush was the face of misery. If ever a wreck came to
                  shore, here was the torn and battered fragment of a gallant craft.</p>
               <p>"Were you in the church this morning?" asked the organist, struggling with
                  himself, speaking with effort; for, to his gaze, the aspect of the stranger was
                  forbidding and awful; and yet it was beyond his power to walk by the side of any
                  man cautious, cold, and dumb. This person was at least a gentleman, and perhaps
                  understood music.</p>
               <p>"Yes," was the brief answer.</p>
               <p>"How did the singing go?"</p>
               <p>"Tolerably."</p>
               <p>"That's a comfort," said the organist, looking more pleased than the occasion
                  seemed to warrant. But he was not a vain man; he merely supposed that the
                  gentleman's reply promised criticism worth hearing.</p>
               <p>"Didn't you hear it yourself?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, after a fashion. I play the organ. It isn't the best situation for
                  hearing. I thought it decent. Particularly the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Gloria in
                     Excelsis.</foreign> I was most anxious about that. How did it sound to you,
                  sir?"</p>
               <p>"Well."</p>
               <p>"But, after all, they didn't understand it."</p>
               <p>"Understand what?"</p>
               <p>"The meaning. It opens with the song of the angels, you know. 'Glory be to God on
                  high; on earth, peace, good will toward men.' They couldn't tell, coherently, what
                  the Peace and Good Will<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6523-00000034"/> meant. That's the
                  worst of it. How can they sing what they don't understand?"</p>
               <p>"Surely. Why don't you teach them?"</p>
               <p>"Why don't I teach them!" exclaimed the organist. "I'm not a brain-maker; that's
                  the reason, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Then, you've tried it?"</p>
               <p>For a minute Summerman seemed vexed by this question; but for no longer than a
                  minute.</p>
               <p>"What's the use? what's the use?" he said to himself, and his answer to the
                  question was a laugh.</p>
               <p>The laugh, though neither loud nor boisterous, but merely a mild evidence of
                  good-nature that was not to be clouded by vexations, had a disagreeable sound to
                  Redman Rush. He looked contemptuous, and felt more than he looked, so that it was
                  really surprising to see him linger for such conversation as this of the organist,
                  and to hear him ask,</p>
               <p>"How do you teach your choir? Whose fault is it that they cannot learn?"</p>
               <p>"Their own fault," answered Summerman. "They've got to learn more than the notes.
                  So they complain. You can't make a singer out of a note-book. I've tried that
                  enough. Now I try to show them that peace means a riddance of selfishness ness,
                  and that selfishness is the devil's device for holding the world together. Not
                  God's; for his idea is love, and was in the beginning. Wasn't the world given to
                  understand, that the life which was born was the love, truth, and beauty of the
                  world, and that by Him all truth and beauty must live? They can't see it. I can't
                  make a man or woman understand that an idea must be the centre around which the
                  life will revolve. They come to practise, not to hear preaching, they say."</p>
               <p>It seemed as if at this, and because of this announcement, Redman Rush drew
                  himself apart and up, loftily, and with a gloomy defiance looked around him. When
                  Summerman's eyes turned toward him, he seemed gazing into distance, and gave no
                  indication that he had heard a word of what had been said. The organist was
                  disappointed. He had hoped again for criticism; but he went on, perhaps with some
                  suspicion of the correctness of his convictions—at least he had not said all he
                  wished to say.</p>
               <p>"We must have a centre—an idea," said he. "And if that be self, then the devil's
                  to pay. Christ is the only absolute idea—the only possible giver of peace,
                  therefore. I mean by Him, His doctrine. He stands for that, <emph>being</emph>
                  Truth, as he said, you know. They came out better on the<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000035"/> 'good will to men,' if you noticed. It was easier
                  for them to believe in the eternal good will of God, this morning. But they failed
                  in the next line, 'We bless Thee, we give thanks to Thee, for Thy great glory!' If
                  they knew more they would sing better. You know what was said, sir, 'Milton
                  himself could not teach a boy more than he could learn.' That's the amount of
                  it."</p>
               <p>Now and then, during these last words, spoken so evidently by a man who liked to
                  talk because he looked for sympathy, and hoped for it, the face of the stranger
                  had changed in its expression; there seemed to be less fierceness, more sadness in
                  his gloom. But the change was so slight as to be hardly perceptible, even to the
                  eyes of Summerman. When he paused in speaking he had still no answer.</p>
               <p>They walked on a few paces in silence, when suddenly the organist stepped up to
                  the door of a house that opened on the sidewalk, and unlocked it.</p>
               <p>"This is my shop," said he; "won't you come in, and warm yourself? it is so cold
                  in spite of the sun."</p>
               <p>Redman Rush hesitated, with his foot upon the doorstep. He looked up and down the
                  street. It was beautiful and bright without, but, oh, how bare and cold! homely
                  enough within, but the glare of a hot coal fire suggested comfort, as the skylight
                  did cheerfulness. Did he really wish for warmth and comfort, for cheerfulness and
                  company? That was the point.</p>
               <p>"Come in, I will show you something," said Summerman.</p>
               <p>"He invites me as if I were another boy like himself," thought the man. Perhaps
                  for the sake of that unimaginable boyhood he crossed the threshold, and allowed
                  Summerman to close the door behind him.</p>
               <p>This room was the organist's home. His household gods were all around him when he
                  stepped into the shop. It was a little place, but so well arranged, that there
                  seemed room, and to spare. Summerman was hospitable as a prince—the shade of
                  Voltaire reminds me of the great Frederick's hospitality! yet, let the word
                  stand.</p>
               <p>This shop gave outward and visible signs of the versatility of its owner's mind.
                  The front part was devoted to the clock and watch making business; before the
                  large window stood a table, where the requisite tools were kept for conduct of
                  that business. A few clocks, and frames of clocks, gathered probably from auction
                  rooms, were ranged upon a shelf, and dust was never allowed to accumulate around
                  or upon them. Never was housemaid<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6523-00000036"/> more
                  exact and scrupulous than the proprietor of this Gallery.</p>
               <p>In the back part of the shop, which was lighted by the skylight, stood the
                  instrument for daguerreo-typing, possession of which would have made the organist
                  a proud man, if anything could have done so.</p>
               <p>When he had invited Mr. Rush to sit down, and the invitation was accepted, it was
                  by a device of Summerman's that the gentleman found himself directly facing the
                  machine, and now, if he took an interest in any earthly thing, or was capable of
                  curiosity, some good would come of it, thought the organist.</p>
               <p>He had promised to show his visitor somewhat, and accordingly approached him with
                  a miniature case in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rush had removed his fur cap, and Summerman approaching him, was so struck by
                  his appearance, the dignity, and pride, and trouble his countenance expressed,
                  that he nearly exclaimed in his surprise, and quite forgot the intention he had,
                  till Mr. Rush reminded him by extending his hand for the picture.</p>
               <p>"This is little Mary," exclaimed he, presenting the miniature. "I took it last
                  summer. She died in October. Maybe you will understand now why I said that we
                  should have had a singer, if she had lived."</p>
               <p>But Summerman was in doubt about this, as, from the point to which he immediately
                  retired, he cast a glance at the face of the stranger, who took the picture, and
                  surveyed it, with such a look.</p>
               <p>At first, it appeared as if a glance would suffice him. But he did not return it
                  with a glance. Was it the brightness and innocence of the young face that won upon
                  him, or did it for the moment take its place as the type of all beauty and
                  innocence, and hold him to contemplation, as for the last time. Was it really into
                  the face of <emph>that</emph> little child, dead and buried since October, that he
                  looked? or was <emph>he</emph> really <emph>here,</emph> under the roof of this
                  poor organist, shut up with the warmth of his coal stove this bright Christmas
                  day, locked safe his secret thoughts, himself secure with them?</p>
               <p>At last some word or sound escaped the organist. He had gazed at Mr. Rush till he
                  seemed possessed of nightmare. So wild, so haggard, so awful, the man's face
                  appeared to him, that the cry, an involuntary one, expressed better than any
                  inquiry could have done, how much disturbed he was. The stranger heard, and seemed
                  to understand, for at the sound he rose quickly, and laid the picture on the
                  counter; not gently; at the same time he looked at<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000037"/> Summerman and laughed; but without merriment.</p>
               <p>"Come," said Summerman quickly, "let me take your portrait. I have quite a
                  collection here, you see." And as he spoke he did not remove his eyes from the
                  stranger—he had come to the conclusion that he was mad, or in some direful strait
                  that made him almost irresponsible, and his first purpose was one of helpful
                  commiseration.</p>
               <p>Instead of quitting the shop straightway, as Summerman expected he would do when
                  he made this proposition (and if he did depart he meant to follow), the stranger
                  walked toward the instrument, and on his way picked up the picture he had thrown
                  down with so little ceremony. He seemed to think he owed this courtesy:</p>
               <p>"Do you find much patronage here?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Oh, considerable," replied Summerman. "Just now more than common. Your likeness
                  is such a good present to make your friend!"</p>
               <p>"Do you think so?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly," was the emphatic response.</p>
               <p>"You ask to take my likeness—what for?"</p>
               <p>"I want it myself."</p>
               <p>"Oh—for a sign. Well, young man, you don't know what it's the sign of, after all,"
                  and here Mr. Rush evidently set himself against the world.</p>
               <p>"I hope it's the sign of a friend," answered Summerman, who was keeping up his
                  spirits by an effort, for the mere presence of this man weighed on them with an
                  almost intolerable weight. Yet he was sparing no effort to retain that
                  presence.</p>
               <p>"Why do you hope that?" asked Mr. Rush with a disagreeable show of authority.</p>
               <p>"Because we met at the church door on Christmas day." Simple answer—yet it was
                  spoken so gently, so truthfully, it seemed to make an impression.</p>
               <p>"Christmas day. So it is. But it's getting late. How high is the sun yet?"</p>
               <p>"Three hours, maybe."</p>
               <p>Hearing this, the gentleman turned away, and walked to the further extremity of
                  the shop. Summerman's eyes followed him with anxiety. But he went on polishing a
                  plate, and seemed beyond all things intent on that.</p>
               <p>Presently Mr. Rush came back.</p>
               <p>"You may take my likeness," said he. "You are a good fellow. And it will help pass
                  time."</p>
               <p>So the artist stepped quickly about, and looked pleased, but not too much so. The
                  work was soon done. While Summerman was putting it through the process of
                  perfection, the gentleman stood and watched him.</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6523-00000038"/>
               <p>"How did you want your choir to sing 'good will to men?'" he asked.</p>
               <p>Summerman did not look up to answer—did not express any surprise, but the whole
                  man was in the reply given:</p>
               <p>"From the heart, sir. Full, confident, assuring. They owe that to God and man, or
                  they've no business in a choir."</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose they could do it?" asked Mr. Rush, not immediately, but, as it
                  seemed, when he had controlled the unpleasant influence the speaker's enthusiastic
                  mode of address had upon him. It seemed as if he were not merely speaking, and
                  engaging the organist in speech for pastime—but rather because he could not help
                  it. His questions, when he asked them, had a more surprising sound to himself than
                  to the person who answered. And they vexed him—but not Summerman. When Mr. Rush
                  asked him if he supposed it possible for them to sing in the way signified, he
                  replied quite confidently:</p>
               <p>"Yes, if they only knew what they were about."</p>
               <p>"But you explained that to them?"</p>
               <p>"Well, then, yes, if they believed it; for after all, belief is of the heart."</p>
               <p>"You don't think they believe it?"</p>
               <p>"It's a hard thing to say. But if they did, they would do better. They are not a
                  happy set altogether. They whine—they talk one thing, and live another. One of
                  them lost a little money the other day—pretty nearly all he had, I suppose—but
                  what of that?"</p>
               <p>"What of that!" exclaimed Mr. Rush, and he looked at the organist amazed.</p>
               <p>"Yes, what of it? The man has his health and his faculties. What's money?"</p>
               <p>"What's money!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, when you come to the point—what is it? Eyes, hands, feet—blood, brain,
                  heart, soul? You would think so to hear him talk. It's dust! I've seen that
                  proved, sir, and I know 'tis true!"</p>
               <p>"You don't allow for circumstances," said the stranger, sharply.</p>
               <p>"Circumstances!" repeated Summerman, incredulous.</p>
               <p>"Yes, the difference between your affairs and those of your neighbors. You seem to
                  judge others by yourself?"</p>
               <p>"My affairs! I haven't any to speak of," said the organist, with a grave sort of
                  wonder.</p>
               <p>"I suppose," replied the stranger, almost angrily, you are a human creature;
                  things happen to you, and they do not. If you have any feeling at all you are
                  affected by what happens." He ceased<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6523-00000039"/>
                  speaking with the manner of a man who is annoyed that he should have been so far
                  beguiled into speech.</p>
               <p>"Some things have happened to me," answered Summerman quietly, seeing everything,
                  pretending to see nothing. "I lived ten years among the Gipsies. I belonged to
                  them. That's where I had my schooling. I worked in the tin ware; and clock mending
                  I took up of myself. I left my people on account of a church-organ. My father and
                  mother were dead. I had no brother or sister; nor any relation. But I had friends,
                  and they would have kept me; but I had to choose between them and the rest. I
                  couldn't learn the organ in the woods and meadows; I was caught by the music as
                  easily as a pink by a pin. But I kept to the clock mending. I used to travel about
                  on my business once in a while, for a man can't settle down to four walls and a
                  tread-mill in a minute, when he's been used to all creation. Then I learned to
                  take pictures, and I travelled about for a time, carrying the machine with me. But
                  for the last year I've lived in this shop and had the church organ. So you see how
                  it is. I have all these things to look after, and I try to keep in tune, and up to
                  pitch.</p>
               <p>"You are a happy man," said Mr. Rush, who had listened with attention to this
                  humble story. "But," he added, "you could not understand—for you have had no
                  cares, no one dependent on you—how necessary to some persons money is for
                  happiness. What ruin follows the loss of it. How many a man would prefer death to
                  such a loss."</p>
               <p>"I guess not," said Summerman, in a low tone. "I believe in the Good Will
                  doctrine."</p>
               <p>"What has that to do with it?" asked the stranger, impatiently.</p>
               <p>To this Summerman replied, speaking slowly—humblest acquiescence sounding through
                  his speech.</p>
               <p>"When I settled down, and got the situation in the church, I was about to bring
                  her here. . . . . You understand. . . . . She died about that time. I have not
                  seen her picture. Her brother had died before. I was to be the son of the old
                  people. We were sure that after awhile they would be attracted by our happy home,
                  and by our fireside all their wanderings would end. They should be free as in the
                  forests. . . . . It is all changed now—but I am still their son, and I wish
                  nothing better than to work for them. The old man is failing, and I think that I
                  shall yet persuade them to come and live with me—we might be one family still—and
                  it would please her. If I succeed, there are two or three rooms close by where we
                  can be tolerably<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6523-00000040"/> happy, all together. God
                  is not indifferent. He sees all. And sure I am that He bears me no ill will. So it
                  must be for the best. She used to wear this ribbon around her splendid hair. She
                  was so young and gay! It would have done you good to look at such a face.
                  Sometimes I catch myself thinking what a long, gay life we ought to have lived
                  together—and I know there's no wickedness in that. It's more pleasant than
                  bitter."</p>
               <p>"So you support the old people," was the listener's sole comment. Not loss, but
                  fidelity—not grief, but constancy, impressed him while he hearkened to this
                  story.</p>
               <p>"I have adopted them," answered the organist. "Yes, they are mine now. Just as
                  they were to have been. Just as she and I used to talk it over. Only she is not
                  here."</p>
               <p>"So you support them," repeated Mr. Rush. And he seemed to ponder that point, as
                  if it involved somewhat beyond his comprehension.</p>
               <p>The organist replied, wondering. And he looked at the questioner—but the
                  questioner looked not at him.</p>
               <p>"Yes, certainly," he said.</p>
               <p>"I suppose they are moderate in their wants. They don't require suites of chambers
                  with frescoed ceilings, and walls hung with white satin, rose color, lavender—and
                  the rest. They don't need a four-story palace, with carpets of velvet to cover the
                  floors from attic to basement. Do they?" All the scorn and bitterness expressed in
                  these words the organist happily could never perceive. But he discerned enough to
                  make him shudder, and he believed that the speaker was mad.</p>
               <p>"I don't think I understand you," he answered, perplexed and cautious. He feared
                  the effect of his words. But anything that he might say would produce now one sole
                  result.</p>
               <p>"Very likely you don't understand," said Mr. Rush.</p>
               <p>"But," said the organist, "I wish I did."</p>
               <p>"Why, man?"</p>
               <p>"You look so troubled, sir."</p>
               <p>"Troubled?"</p>
               <p>"As if you—hadn't—tired out the Good Will doctrine. I mean—yes, I do! that I
                  shouldn't suppose you believed in it," said Summerman, bravely.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rush laughed bitterly. "I'll tell you a story," said he.</p>
               <p>"No—no—I mean not yet—don't," exclaimed Summerman, quickly.</p>
               <p>"Why, it's a short tale. I'm not going to<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6523-00000041"/>
                  trouble you much longer. A fine holiday you're having! But you'll never have
                  another like it, I believe. I—I want your advice before I go. Besides, you have
                  kept to your green, sunny love so long, I would like to give you a notion of
                  what's going on the other side of the fence."</p>
               <p>"Then we will walk," said Summerman, "if it's agreeable to you, sir, I mean, of
                  course. I always walk around the lake at this hour." The little man had put on his
                  overcoat while he spoke, and now stood waiting the stranger's pleasure, cap in
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"Dare you leave that face of mine among the other faces?" asked Mr. Rush, with all
                  seriousness.</p>
               <p>The organist looked nervously around as if he expected something to justify the
                  trouble this question occasioned him.</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes—I'll take the risk," he answered, but he spoke without a smile. One
                  thought alone prevented him from heartily wishing himself rid of this companion,
                  who; in spite of him, had cast such a gloom over his Christmas day. The man seemed
                  to have more need of him than Summerman had of his dinner deferred.</p>
               <p>They set out together to walk through the frosty air under the cloudless sky. The
                  sun was near to setting. In half an hour a deep orange belt would unroll round the
                  east, flaming signs would mark the heavens, and a great star hang in the midst of
                  an amethyst hemicycle.</p>
               <p>They noticed that the sun was near to setting, and one of them saw the glory.</p>
               <p>"I want you to tell me honestly," said the other. "You have taken my picture; what
                  do you think it looks like? That is a fair question."</p>
               <p>"Like misery," replied Summerman, promptly enough.</p>
               <p>"Is that all? I thought worse. I thought it looked like a very devil's face. When
                  I go back, I'll destroy it. But, then, it looks like me! Now, I can't afford to
                  live a scarecrow. I believe I wasn't made to frighten others to death. I'd choose
                  to die myself first." He dropped his voice to a whisper. "I've been trying to do
                  that. Tried twice. Is there any particular luck in a third time, that you know
                  of?"</p>
               <p>Summerman did not answer, though Rush was looking full upon him; neither did he
                  avoid the long and piercing gaze the stranger fixed upon him. He met that like a
                  man.</p>
               <p>"You think I'm mad," at last said Mr. Rush.</p>
               <p>"Not exactly."</p>
               <p>"Thank you. But you are a gipsy. Read my fortune."</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6523-00000042"/>
               <p>Gravely Summerman looked at the fair, smooth palm that was suddenly stretched
                  before him.</p>
               <p>"You have been unfortunate," said he.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no; you mustn't admit that. Only a little money lost, that's all."</p>
               <p>"Is it all, indeed?" asked Summerman, and he dropped the palm. Then he shook his
                  head. "I do not think it could have served you so. A little loss!" said he.</p>
               <p>"That is because fortune never made a fool of you. Let me alone; I want to think."
                  He spoke in the quick, peremptory manner of a man who is accustomed to command;
                  but he came very near to smiling the next moment, as he looked down at the little
                  person whom he had ordered into silence.</p>
               <p>Then he broke the silence he had enjoined.</p>
               <p>"Suppose you were in my case," said he, "how would you act?"</p>
               <p>"I am not. How can I tell?" was Summerman's prudent answer.</p>
               <p>These words, as indeed any words that he could have spoken, were the best that
                  Redman Rush could hear; for now he was leaning with the whole weight of his moral
                  nature on the life of this strong-hearted, true-hearted organist. He liked the
                  unpresuming, modest, generous word.</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you what you would be," said he, quickly. "A month ago worth half a
                  million—to-day not a cent. Brought up like a fool, you would probably be one.
                  Turned out of house, helpless as a baby. You have yourself—master of your wits and
                  your hands. Look at these hands! And all my wits can advise me is, this life isn't
                  worth the keeping."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no; not to-day! They don't say that to-day!" exclaimed Summerman, speaking as
                  if he knew. And he ventured further, boldly: "They advise you, go home to your
                  wife and your child; live for them and yourself, and God's honor."</p>
               <p>"Wife—child!" repeated Rush; and he blushed when he added; "you read fortunes.
                  Your pardon."</p>
               <p>"I saw it in your face," said the organist, quietly. "When you looked at our
                  little Mary, I believed you were thinking of some other little child. And it
                  reminded you of some other young lady, when I told you what I expected once. If it
                  hadn't been for them, you would never have thought of destroying yourself; and I'm
                  sure, on their account, what you ought to ask and hope is, that your life may be
                  spared."</p>
               <p>It is said that drowning men will grasp at straws. This elegant stranger, who had
                  emerged from mystery<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6523-00000043"/> tery to disturb the
                  Christmas day of a humble organist, now leaned on the friendly arm of the little
                  man, walking along with him, <emph>not</emph> as he once sauntered through the
                  promenade, a butterfly disdaining all but the brightest of sunbeams, the sweetest
                  of flowers. Poor worm! he was half frozen in this wintry brightness, this
                  exhilarating atmosphere, in which Summerman throve so well.</p>
               <p>"Are all the men that are born in woods and meadows, and brought up tinkers, like
                  you?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"No," answered Summerman. "Some turn out fools, and some knaves, and some ten
                  times better men and wiser men, than I shall ever be."</p>
               <p>"Like the rest of the world. Are men, men everywhere?"</p>
               <p>"Pretty much. You talk about your wits. You were made to do a bigger business than
                  I shall ever do. Go home and begin it. I've a mind to go with you, so you shan't
                  lose your way."</p>
               <p>"You know the way so well," said Rush. He had not before spoken as he now spoke,
                  almost cheerfully, almost hopefully. Here was this fellow that told fortunes,
                  daring to prophesy good days for him! But then, was he not a bankrupt? And if he
                  lived—a beggar still?</p>
               <p>The sun had set, and the faces of the two men were again turned to the village.
                  They had walked quite round the lake, and Summerman had concluded that he would
                  invite the gentleman to dine with him when they came back to the inn; would he
                  accept the courtesy? Summerman looked at Mr. Rush, that he might ascertain the
                  probabilities, and thought that he could see a breaking of the black clouds which
                  held this man a prisoner. He wanted to preach to him. He wanted exceedingly to
                  launch out again on the Good Will doctrine; and at length he did, but not exactly
                  in the manner he would have chosen, had he been left to himself.</p>
               <p>As they walked along in silence, suddenly came and met them the sound of a quick
                  clanging church bell; then rose a mighty cry, and a still more potent flame
                  ascending heavenward.</p>
               <p>"It's a fire!" cried Summerman. And, true to his living impulse and instinct,
                  which was forever—first and last, and ever—the good of the public, the little man
                  set off on a run. His companion, the gentleman who had never, in his thirty years,
                  run to a fire, with generous intent, followed on as fleetly. So they came together
                  to the village street, when, lo! the shop of Daniel Summerman, was making all this
                  stir! drawing such crowds<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6523-00000044"/> about it as
                  never before the artist's varied powers had done.</p>
               <p>There was neither door nor roof, wall or window, visible, but a pit of flame, and
                  within, as everybody knew, the entire stock, sum total of the organist's worldly
                  goods.</p>
               <p>"Well! well!" said he, as, panting, he came to a stand-still in the middle of the
                  street, his companion close beside him.</p>
               <p>"Curse God, and die!" was all that the wife of Job could think to say to him, in
                  his extremity.</p>
               <p>"Well! well!" was the comment Redman Rush could make on this disaster, repeating
                  Summerman's words with an emphasis not all his own. It was evident that, for a
                  moment at least, he had forgotten himself; his face was no longer dark with
                  misery, but full of consternation, alive with sympathy. And still he said:</p>
               <p>"Where's your Good Will doctrine, though?"</p>
               <p>"Safe!" cried the organist, and he crossed his arms on his breast with a look of
                  perfect triumph.</p>
               <p>"You eat your words with a vengeance. You preach the best sermon I ever heard,
                     <emph>I</emph> swear," said Mr. Rush, looking at him with amazement.</p>
               <p>"Humph!" ejaculated Summerman.</p>
               <p>"I believe, after all, 'twas my cursed picture that did it," continued Rush. He
                  was not able to stand there in silence listening to the roaring of the fire, by
                  the side of the man whose property was being destroyed in this relentless manner.
                  He must talk; and no one hindered him, for the most of the working force of the
                  village was busy trying to draw water from the frozen pumps of the
                  neighborhood.</p>
               <p>"I might have known such a face would raise the devil," muttered he.</p>
               <p>"Then, they are both done for!" was Summerman's quick answer. "If you are burnt to
                  death, it's clear you can't be drowned. So, it seems you're a new man altogether.
                  Sir, your wife calls you! But, before you go, pray, take the Good Will doctrine
                  in. A present from me, if you please."</p>
               <p>Having said these words, the organist wiped his eyes, and laughed.</p>
               <p>"If this is a dream," said Redman Rush, astonished into doubt of all he saw and
                  heard, "let me get home before I wake up, for God's sake." And he turned away from
                  the organist, and was hid in the crowd from the eyes that followed him.</p>
               <p>He turned away, but would he ever lose the memory of a soft voice, saying:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Summerman, my boys and I insist on your coming to spend the holidays with
                  us."</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6523-00000045"/>
               <p>Or, of a grey-haired gentleman's aspect, who came hurrying through the crowd till
                  he stood face to face with the little organist, whose hands he grasped as he
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Never mind, lad; never mind. You'll be a richer man before night than you ever
                  were before. Here is a year's salary in advance, from the church, sir. You
                  understand. And we all want our daguerreotypes; so order an instrument."</p>
               <p>Or, of an agitated voice, that followed him like the voice of a spirit, mysterious
                  and persuasive:</p>
               <p>"Oh, believe in the Good Will Doctrine!"</p>

               <p>THREE names, clustered together in more than one marked association, have a

                  to the heart, of kindred sympathy and suffering. True poets, they have placed in
                  their spiritual alembic the common woes and sorrows of life, and extracted from
                  them "by force of their so potent art," a cordial for the race.</p>

               <p>Has it ever occurred to the reader to reflect how much the world owes to the poets
                  in the alleviation of sorrow? It is much to hear the simple voice of sympathy in
                  its plainest utterances from the companions around us; it is something to listen
                  to the same burden from the good of former generations, as the universal
                  experience of humanity; but we owe the greatest debt to those who by the graces of
                  intellect and the pains of a profounder passion, have triumphed over affliction,
                  and given eloquence to sorrow.</p>
               <p>There is a common phrase, which some poet must first have invented—"the luxury of
                  woe." Poets certainly have found their most constant themes in suffering. When the
                  late Edgar Poe, who prided himself on reducing literature to an art, sat down to
                  write a poem which should attain the height of popularity, he said sorrow must be
                  its theme, and wrote "The Raven." Tragedy will always have a deeper hold upon the
                  public than comedy; it appeals to deeper principles, stirs more powerful emotions,
                  imparts an assured sense of strength, is more intimate with our nature, or
                  certainly it would not be tolerated. There is no delight in the exhibition of
                  misery as such, it is only painful and repulsive; we discard all vulgar horrors
                  utterly, and keep no place for them in the mind. Let, however, a poet touch the
                  string, and there is another response when he brings before us pictures of regal
                  grief, and gives grandeur to humiliation and penalty. Nor is it only in the higher
                  walks of tragedy, with its pomp and circumstances of action, that the poet here
                  serves us. His humbler minstrelsy has soothed many an English heart from the tale
                  of "Lycidas" to the elegiac verse of Tennyson. George Herbert still speaks to this
                  generation as two centuries ago he spoke to his own. His quaint verses gather new
                  beauties from time as they come to us redolent with the prayers and aspirations of
                  many successions of the wives, mothers and daughters of England and America;
                  bedewed with the tears of orphans and parents; an incitement to youth, a solace to
                  age, a consolation for humanity to all time.</p>
               <p>These have been costly gifts to our benefactors. "I honor," says Vaughan, "that
                  temper which can lay by the garland when he might keep it on; which can pass by a
                  rosebud and bid it grow when he is invited to crop it." This is the spirit of
                  self-devotion in every worthy action, and especially of the pains and penalties by
                  which poets have enriched our daily life. We are indebted to the poets, too, for
                  something more than the alleviation of sorrow. Perhaps it is, upon the whole, a
                     rarer<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6523-00000048"/> gift to improve prosperity. Joy,
                  commonly, is less of a positive feeling than grief, and is more apt to slip by us
                  unconsciously. Few people, says the proverb, know when they are well off. It is
                  the poet's vocation to teach the world this— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-1">——"to be possess'd with double pomp,</l>
                        <l>To guard a title that was rich before,</l>
                        <l>To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,</l>
                        <l>To throw a perfume on the violet."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> The poet lifts our eyes to the beauties of external nature, educates us to a
                  keener participation in the sweet joys of affection, to the loveliness and grace
                  of woman, to the honor and strength of manhood. His ideal world thus becomes an
                  actual one, as the creations of imagination first borrowed from sense, alight from
                  the book, the picture or the statue once again to live and walk among us.</p>
               <p>The resemblances which have induced us to bring together our sacred triumvirate of
                  poets, are the common period in which they lived, their similar training in youth,
                  a congenial bond of learning, a certain generous family condition, the inspiration
                  of the old mother church out of which they sprung, the familiar discipline of
                  sorrow, the early years in which they severally wrote.</p>
               <p>A brief glance at their respective lives may indicate cate still further these
                  similarities and point a moral which needs not many words to express—which seems
                  to us almost too sacred to be loudly or long dwelt upon.</p>
               <p>HERBERT was the oldest of the band, having been born near the close of the
                  sixteenth century, in the days of James, who was an intelligent patron of the
                  family. The poet's brother, the learned Lord Herbert of Cherbury, whose
                  "Autobiography" breathes the fresh manly spirit of the best days of chivalry, was
                  the king's ambassador to France. George Herbert, too, was in a fair way to this
                  court patronage, when his hopes were checked by the death of the monarch. It is a
                  circumstance, this court favor, worth considering in the poet's life, as the
                  antecedent to his manifold spirit of piety. Nothing is more noticeable than the
                  wide, liberal culture of the old English poets; they were first, men, often
                  skilled in affairs, with ample experience in life, and then—poets.</p>
               <p>Herbert's education was all that care and affection could devise. "He spent," says
                  his amiable biographer, Izaak Walton, "much of his childhood in a sweet content
                  under the eye and care of his prudent mother, and the tuition of a chaplain or
                  tutor to him and two of his brothers in her own<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000049"/> family." At Cambridge he became orator to the
                  University, gained the applause of the court by his Latin orations, and what is
                  more, secured the friend ship of such men as Bishop Andrews, Dr. Donne, and the
                  model diplomatist of his age, Sir Henry Wotton. The completion of his studies and
                  the failure of court expectations were followed by a passage of rural retirement—a
                  first pause of the soul previous to the deeper conflicts of life. His solitariness
                  was increased by sickness, a period of meditation and devotional feeling, assisted
                  by the intimations of a keen spirit in a feeble body—and out of the furnace came
                  forth Herbert the priest and saint. All that knowledge can inspire, all that
                  tenderness can endear, centres about that picture of the beauty of holiness, his
                  brief pastoral career—as we read it in his prose writings and his poems, and the
                  pages of Walton—at the little village of Bemerton. He died at the age of
                  thirty-nine—his gentle spirit spared the approaching conflicts of his country,
                  which pressed so heavily upon the Church which he loved.</p>
               <p>The poems of Herbert are now read throughout the world; no longer confined to that
                  Church which inspired them. They are echoed at times in the pulpits of all
                  denominations, while their practical lines are, if we remember rightly, scattered
                  among the sage aphorisms of Poor Richard, and their wide philosophy commends
                  itself to the genius of Emerson.</p>
               <p>It is pleasant in these old poets to admire what has been admired by others—to
                  read the old verses with the indorsement of genius. The name adds value to the
                  bond. Coleridge, for instance, whose "paper," in a mercantile sense, would have
                  been, on "change," the worst in England, has given us many of these notable
                  "securities." They live in his still echoing "Table-Talk," and are sprinkled
                  generously over his writings—while what record is there of the "good," the best
                  financial names of the day? One sonnet of Herbert was an especial favorite with
                  Coleridge. It was that heart-searching, sympathizing epitome of spiritual life,
                  entitled <q>

                  </q> These poems, it should be remembered, are private devotional
                  heart-confessions, not written for sale, for pay or reputation; they were not
                  printed at all during the author's life, but were brought forth by faithful
                  friends from the sacred coffer of his dying-room, in order that posterity might
                  know the secret of that honorable life and its cheerful end. Izaak Walton has
                  given a beautiful setting to one stanza from the eloquent ode "Sunday." "The
                  Sunday before his death," his biographer tells us, "he rose suddenly from his bed
                  or couch, called for one of his instruments, took it into his hand, and said: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                  man's poetry is to know the man and what he may have encountered, we may cite the
                  poem entitled "The Pearl." It is compact of life and experience: we see the
                  courtier and the scholar ripening into the saint; the world not forgotten or
                  ignored, but its best pursuits calmly weighed, fondly enumerated and left behind,
                  as steps of the celestial ladder.</p>

               <p>We might linger long with Herbert, gathering the fruits of wisdom and piety from
                  the abundant orchard of his poems, where many a fruit "hangs amiable;" but we must
                  listen to his brethren.</p>
               <p>HENRY VAUGHAN was the literary offspring of George Herbert. His life, too, might
                  have been written by good Izaak Walton, so gentle was it, full of all pleasant
                  associations and quiet nobleness, decorated by the love of nature and letters,
                  intimacies with poets, and with that especial touch of nature which always went to
                  the heart of the Complete Angler, a love of fishing—for Vaughan was wont, at
                  times, to skim the waters of his native rivers.</p>
               <p>He was born in Wales; the old Roman name of the country conferring upon him the
                  appellation "Silurist"—for in those days local pride and affection claimed the
                  honor of the bard, as the poet himself first gathered strength from the home,
                  earth and sky which concentrated rather than circumscribed cumscribed his genius.
                  His family was of good old lineage, breathing freely for generations in the upper
                  atmosphere of life, warmed and cheered in a genial sunlight of prosperity. It
                  could stir, too, at the call of patriotism, and send soldiers, as it did, to bite
                  the heroic dust at Agincourt. Another time brought other duties. The poet came
                  into the world in the early part of the seventeenth century, when the great
                  awakening of thought and English intellect was to be followed by stirring action.
                  He was not, indeed, to bear any great part in the senate or the field; but all
                  noble spirits were moved by the issues of the time. To some the voice of the age
                  brought hope and energy; to others, a not ignoble submission. It was perhaps as
                  great a thing to suffer with the Royal Martyr, with all the burning life and
                  traditions of England in the throbbing heart, as to rise from the ruins into the
                  cold ether where the stern soul of Milton could wing its way in self-reliant
                  calmness. Honor is due, as in all great struggles, to both parties. Vaughan's lot
                  was cast with the conquered cause.</p>
               <p>His youth was happy, as all poets' should be, and as the genius of all true poets,
                  coupled with that period of life, will go far to make it. There must be early
                  sunshine for the first nurture of that delicate plant: the storm comes afterward
                  to perfect<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6523-00000053"/> its life. Vaughan first saw
                  the light in a rural district of great beauty. His songs bear witness to it.
                  Indeed he is known by his own designation, a fragrant title in the sweet fields of
                  English poesy, as the Swan of the Usk, though he veiled the title in the thin garb
                  of the Latin, "Olor Iscanus." Another fortunate circumstance was the personal
                  character of his education, at the hands of a rural Welsh rector, with whom, his
                  twin brother for a companion, he passed the years of youth in what, we have no
                  doubt, were pleasant paths of classical literature. How inexhaustible are those
                  old wells of Greek and Roman Letters! The world cannot afford to spare them long.
                  They may be less in fashion at one time than another, but their beauty and
                  life-giving powers are perennial. The Muse of English poesy has always been
                  baptized in their waters.</p>
               <p>The brothers left for Oxford at the mature age—not a whit too late for any
                  minds—of seventeen or eighteen. At the University there were other words than the
                  songs of Apollo. The Great Revolution was already on the carpet, and it was to be
                  fought out with weapons not found in the logical armory of Aristotle. The brothers
                  were royalists, of course; and Henry, before the drama was played out, like many
                  good men and true, tasted the inside of a prison—doubtless, like Lovelace and
                  Wither, singing his heartfelt minstrelsy behind the wires of his cage. He was not
                  a fighting man. Poets rarely are. More than one lyrist—as Archilochus and Horace
                  may bear witness—has thrown away his shield on the field of battle. Vaughan wisely
                  retired to his native Wales. Jeremy Taylor, too, it may be remembered, was locking
                  up the treasures of his richly-furnished mind and passionate feeling within the
                  walls of those same Welsh hills. Nature, alone, however, is inadequate to the
                  production of a true poet. Even Wordsworth, the most patient, absorbed of
                  recluses, had his share of education in London and travel in foreign cities.
                  Vaughan, too, early found his way, in visits, to the metropolis, where he heard at
                  the Globe Tavern the last echoes of that burst of wit and knowledge which had
                  spoken from the tongue and kindled in the eye of Shakspeare, Spenser and Raleigh.
                  Ben Jonson was still alive, and the young poets who flocked to him, as a later age
                  worshipped Dryden, were all "sealed of the tribe of Ben." Randolph and Cartwright
                  were his friends.</p>
               <p>Under these early inspirations of youth, nature, learning, witty companionship,
                  Vaughan published his first verses—breathing a love of his art and its pleasures
                  of imagination, paying his tribute to his<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6523-00000054"
                  /> paternal books in "Englishing," the "Tenth Satyre of Juvenal," and not
                  forgetting, of course, the lovely "Amoret." A young poet without a lady in his
                  verse is a solecism which nature abhors. All this, however, as his biographer
                  remarks, "though fine in the way of poetic speculation, would not do for every-day
                  practice." Of course not; and the young "swan" turned his wary feet from the
                  glittering stream to the solid land. The poet became a physician. It was a noble
                  art for such a spirit to practise, and not a very rude progress from youthful
                  poesy if he felt and thought aright. There was a sterner change in store, however,
                  and it came to him with the monition, "Physician, heal thyself!" He was prostrated
                  by severe bodily disease, and thenceforth his spirit was bowed to the claims of
                  the unseen world. The "light amorist" found a higher inspiration. He turned his
                  footsteps to the Temple and worshipped at the holy altar of Herbert. His poetry
                  becomes religious. "Sparks from the Flint" is the title which he gives his new
                  verses, "Silex Scintillans." After that pledge to holiness given to the world, he
                  survived nearly half a century, dying at the mature age of seventy-three—a happy
                  subject of contemplation in the bosom of his Welsh retirement, passing quietly
                  down the vale of life, feeding his spirit on the early-gathered harvest of wit,
                  learning, taste, feeling, fancy, benevolence and piety.</p>
               <p>Of such threads was the life of our poet spun.</p>
               <p>His verse is light, airy, flying with the lark to heaven. Hear him with "his
                  singing robes" about him: <q>

               <p>But we must leave this fair garden of the poet's fancies. The reader will find
                  there many a flower yet untouched.</p>
               <p>RICHARD CRASHAW was the contemporary of the early years of Vaughan; for, alas! he
                  died young—though not till he had transcribed for the world the hopes, the
                  aspirations, the sorrows of his troubled life. He lived but thirty-four years—the
                  volume of his verses is not less nor more than the kindred books of the brother
                  poets with whom we are now associating his memory. A small body of verse will hold
                  much life; for the poet gives us a concentrated essence, an elixir, a skillful
                  confection of humanity, which, diluted with the commonplaces of every-day thought
                  and living, may cover whole shelves of libraries. The secret of the whole of one
                  life may be expressed in a song or a sonnet. The little books of the world are not
                  the least.</p>
               <p>Crashaw, also, was a scholar. The son of a clergyman, he was educated at the famed
                  Charter-house and afterward at Cambridge. The Revolution, too, overtook him. He
                  refused the oath of the covenant, was ejected from his fellowship, became a Roman
                  Catholic, and took refuge in Paris, where he ate the bread of exile with Cowley
                  and others, cheered by the noble sympathy—it could not be much more—of Queen
                  Henrietta Maria. She recommended him to Rome, and the sensitive poet carried his
                  joys and sorrows to the bosom of the church. He lived a few years, and died canon
                  of Loretto, at the age of thirty-four.</p>
               <p>Though the son of a zealous opponent of the Roman church; Crashaw was born with an
                  instinct and heart for its service. There runs through all his poetry that
                  sensuousness of feeling which seeks the repose and luxury of faith which Rome
                  always offers to her ardent votaries. It is profitable to compare the sentiment of
                  Crashaw with the more intellectual development of Herbert. What in the former is
                  the paramount, constant exhibition, in the latter is accepted, and holds its place
                  subordinate to other claims. Without a portion of it there<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000057"/> could be no deep religious life—with it, in excess,
                  we fear for the weakness of a partial development. There is so much gain, however,
                  to the poet, that we have no disposition to take exception to the single string of
                  Crashaw. The beauty of the Venus was made up from the charms of many models. So,
                  in our libraries, as in life, we must be content with parcel-work, and take one
                  man's wisdom and another's sentiment, looking out that we get something of each to
                  enrich our multifarious life.</p>
               <p>Crashaw's poetry is one musical echo and aspiration. He finds his theme and
                  illustration constantly in music. His amorous descant never fails him: his lute is
                  always by his side. Following the "Steps of the Temple," a graceful tribute to
                  Herbert, we have the congenial title, "The Delights of the Muses," opening with
                  that exquisite composition: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Untwisting all the chains that tie</l>
                        <l>The hidden soul of harmony,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> "Music's Duel." It is the story—a favorite one to the ears of our forefathers
                  two centuries ago—of the nightingale and the musician contending with voice and
                  instrument in alternate melodies, till the sweet songstress of the grove falls and
                  dies upon the lute of her rapt rival. It is something more than a pretty tale.
                  Ford, the dramatist, introduced it briefly in happy lines in "The Lover's
                  Melancholy," but Crashaw's verses inspire the very sweetness and lingering
                  pleasure of the contest. It is high noon when the "sweet lute's master" seeks
                  retirement from the heat, "on the scene of a green plat, under protection of an
                  oak," by the bank of the Tiber. The "light-foot lady," <q>
                     <l>"The sweet inhabitant of each glad tree,"</l>
                  </q> "entertains the music's soft report," which begins with a flying prelude, to
                  which the lady of the tree "carves out her dainty voice" with "quick volumes of
                  wild notes." <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"His nimble hand's instinct then taught each string,</l>
                        <l>A cap'ring cheerfulness; and made them sing</l>

               <p>What wealth of imagery and proud association of ideas—the bubbling spring, the
                  golden, waving harvest, "ploughed by her breath"—the fane of Apollo suggesting in
                  a word images of Greek maidens in chorus by the white temple of the God, the dew
                  of Helicon, the soft waking of men from beneficent repose. It is all very well to
                  talk of a bird doing all this: we admire nightingales, but Philomela never
                  enchanted us in this way; it is the sex with which we are charmed. The poet's
                  "light-foot lady" tells us the secret. We are subdued by the loveliest of
                  prima-donnas.</p>
               <p>There is more of this, and as good. The little poem is a poet's dictionary of
                  musical expression. Its lines, less than two hundred, deserve to be committed to
                  memory, to rise at times in the mind—the soft assuagement of cares and
                  sorrows.</p>
               <p>A famous poem of Crashaw is "On a Prayer-Book sent to Mrs. M. R." It breathes a

               <p>We are not reprinting Crashaw, and must forbear further quotation. It is enough if
                  we have presented to the reader a lily or a rose from his pages, and have given a
                  clue to that treasure-house— <q>
                     <l>"A box where sweets compacted lie."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A generation nurtured in poetic susceptibility by the genius of Keats and
                  Tennyson, should not forget the early muse of Crashaw. His verse is the very soul
                  of tenderness and imaginative luxury: less intellectual, less severe in the
                  formation of a broad, manly character than Herbert; catching up the brighter
                  inspirations of Vaughan, and excelling him in richness—it has a warm, graceful
                  garb of its own. It is tinged with the glowing hues of Spenser's fancy; baptized
                  in the fountains of sacred love, it draws an earthly inspiration from the
                  beautiful in nature and life, as in the devout paintings of the great Italian
                  masters, we find the models of their angels and seraphs on earth.</p>

               <head>THE KINGDOMS OF NATURE PRAISING GOD:</head>
               <head type="sub">A SHORT ESSAY ON THE 148TH PSALM.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY REV. C. A. BARTOL.</head>
               <p>SURROUNDED as we are with the art and handicraft of man—almost everything we see
                  bearing the mark of his finger, the house and the street, the market and exchange,
                  every instrument and utensil—it is well, occasionally, to look forth from this
                  little world of custom and convenience we ourselves have constructed, into that
                  which bears the impress of the Almighty's hand—is still as it was left from His
                  forming strength, and brings us into immediate communion with His Infinite mind.
                  Let us, at least, listen to the notes of David's lyre on the creative Majesty.</p>
               <p>After an invocation to the heavenly host, the Psalmist calls first on the forms of
                  inanimate and inorganic existence. These things, of which he enumerates a few,
                  praise the power of God. The crags and headlands, jarred and worn by the billows
                  lows they breast; the granite peaks, bald and grey, under light and tempest, with
                  the silent host of rocky boulders, swept, we know not by what convulsions, from
                  their native seat, stand up as the first rank in the choir of the Maker's worship;
                  and infidelity and atheism are hushed and abashed by their lofty praise.</p>
               <p>Organized, but still unconscious existence takes the next station in this
                  universal chorus. The solemn grove lifting its green top into the heavens, beside
                  that motionless army of ancient stones, adds a sweeter note than they can give to
                  the great harmony. It is a note, speaking not alone of the Creator's power, but of
                  His wisdom too. Here is life and growth. Here are adaptations and stages of
                  progress. From the minutest germination, from the slenderest stem, from the
                  smallest trembling leaf to the hugest trunks and the highest overshadowing
                  branches, this vegetable organization, verdant, pale, crimson, in changeable
                  colors, runs; stopping short only with Alpine summits or polar posts, swiftly and
                  softly clothing again the rents and gashes in the ground made by the stroke of
                  labor or the wheels of war—blooming into the golden and ruddy harvest on the stalk
                  and the bough, even overpassing the salt shore, to line the dismal and unvisited
                  caves of the<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6523-00000064"/> deep with peculiar
                  varieties of growth; and casting forth into our hands from the foaming brine
                  delicate and strangely beautiful leaves and slight ramifications of matchless
                  tints and proportions.</p>
               <p>But the Psalmist summons a third order of beings to contribute its melodious share
                  to this hallelujah; and that is the living and conscious, though irrational
                  tribes. This sings not of power and wisdom alone, but more complex and rich in
                  adoration, sings of goodness also. God has not made the world for a dead spectacle
                  and mere picture for His own eye. How full and crowded with life, and happy life,
                  His creation is! Go forth from inclosing city walls, and, in the summer noontide,
                  stop in solitude and apparent silence and listen; and soon the sounds of this
                  joyous life shall come to your ear: the chirp of the insects—the rustle of
                  wings—the crackling of the leaves, as the blithesome airy creatures pass—the
                  short, thick warble of the bird by your side, or its varied tune, clearer than
                  viol or organ, from the thicket beyond—while, from time to time, the deep low of
                  cattle reverberates from afar. Or if you are where the still and speechless
                  creatures inhabit, open your eye to gaze and examine, and it shall be filled with
                  the visible, as the ear with the vocal signs of living enjoyment. Walking at the
                  edge of the ebbing tide, you tread on life at every step—shelly tribe on tribe of
                  fish pressing together, while in the clear water, other tribes noiselessly swim
                  and glide away. Every vital motion speaks of pleasure, whether in that restless
                  current below, or in the air above, as the feathered songster passes, darting up
                  and down his element, delight gushing from his throat at every buoyant
                  spring—silence and sound, with double demonstration, declaring to the Creator's
                  praise the great and limitless boon of life.</p>
               <p>But there is one accent more, that of love, without which the hymn is not
                  complete; and there is another human order of Being to speak that accent. Man
                  includes in himself all the preceding orders of Being, with all the notes of their
                  praise: the material clod, for is he not made of dust; the plant, for he has an
                  outward growth and circulation—the animal, for he has instinct and feeling; while
                  reason and conscience and spiritual affection he has peculiarly and alone; so that
                  Power, Wisdom, Goodness and Love, all concentrated in him, complete the ground of
                  his praise.</p>
               <p>Yet, as we look out upon this mighty sum of things in the external universe, the
                  level earth stretching off to some ascending ridge in the horizon's blue
                  distance—the boundless deep spread afar,<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6523-00000065"
                  /> till, at the misty edge of vision it bends, in mingling threefold circles, to
                  embrace the globe, the impenetrable below and the infinite above him, how slight
                  and insignificant a creature he seems! like a fly that clings to the ceiling, or a
                  mote that swims in the sunbeam, one of the mere mites of nature, easily lost by
                  the way or a frail figure ready to be crushed by any stroke of the ponderous
                  machinery mid which he moves. When he reflects on his condition—his brief date,
                  his speedy doom—how inconsiderable his existence appears! Or when he regards
                  himself as not a compound of matter merely, but as a living soul, how easy it
                  seems, as his contemplation runs out absorbed into the wondrous glory of the
                  world, for all the vital energy which is for a moment insulated in his frame, when
                  his frame dissolves, to pass into the general substance from which it came, the
                  thinking creature ending as it began! But a voice from heaven cries to him and
                  says, "Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him. I will
                  set him on high because he hath known my name; with long life will I satisfy him
                  and show him my salvation."</p>
               <p>This love of God makes the society of all human affection. "God made the country,
                  and man made the town," is an oft quoted line; and not seldom it is implied that
                  the open or thinly-peopled landscape is somehow a better and holier place for the
                  soul than the thronged city. But let it not be forgotten that man himself is God's
                  work and His highest work on earth. Would we sing our psalm now or hereafter with
                  the sweetest relish, we must go forth from any little circle we may have drawn
                  around us, of private ease and personal comfort, in friendly intercourse to hear
                  the cry of the unfortunate, the sighing of the prisoner, the sob of the mourner,
                  the groan of the sick, the appeal of the injured and oppressed. By our aid,
                  consolation and succor, we must gather their voices into the chorus, before, with
                  perfect satisfaction, we can mingle in it our own.</p>
               <p>Upon a Sabbath day, I walked amid all those charms and fascinations, in which
                  nature can bind us as in a spell. I passed through green aisles of woods, that
                  were ever-shadowed and made fragrant with every various vegetable growth of this
                  temperate northern clime; while the morning beam of the sun in heaven fell
                  brightly aslant the leaves and branches; and the birds, that my lonely step
                  startled from their perch or nest, flew from glen to glen, making with their song,
                  save the murmur of the breeze in the boughs, the only sound I could hear. At
                  length, the high-arched avenues of this<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6523-00000066"/>
                  immense forest-cathedral let me out upon the broad, open shore, where I saw and
                  heard wave after wave break on the rocks, with shifting splendor and that mellow
                  thundering music which so saddens while it delights. Solitude, verily, was
                  stretched out asleep in the sun upon the length of sandy beach and beetling
                  promontory; and I sat and gazed now over the boundless waters, now into the
                  devouring abysses opened by the bending crests of the billows, and anon into the
                  gloomy depths of the forest or the serene and measureless openings of the sky.
                  What grandeur in every line transcendent! Yet what impenetrable mystery too, what
                  menacing ruin to the small remnant of human life still spared from the generations
                  in ages past, already swallowed up! Peering around in this pensive mood, in which
                  the joy of being mixed with the uneasy doubt of its tenure, my eye fell at last on
                  the spire of a little church, rising like a pencil of light to heaven, out of the
                  fathomless waste. And there my soul alighted and found rest. Like some sea mark to
                  the voyager, that slender shaft, reared by the social religion of the world, stood
                  to tell me where in the universe I was; the common Christian consciousness
                  reinforced my own, and dark queries and agitating uncertainties subsided from my
                  spirit, as the deluge from the dove that Noah sent out to pluck the green branch
                  of promise. From the illimitable reaches of the huge, but dimly responding
                  creation around, the slight, frail temple for God's praise drew me to its welcome
                  and peaceful embrace. As I approached it, the tolling of the bell struck on my ear
                  in a touch of gladder tidings than I had received from all the melody of the great
                  wind-harp of the trees, with all the soft accord of the tossing billows. Stroke
                  after stroke, distinctly falling, seemed to bring to me the echoes of a million
                  holy telegraphic towers all over the surface of the globe; and when I came to
                  stand under the eaves of the small sanctuary, the measured turning, in the belfry,
                  of the wheel, by revolutions such as I had seen long years ago in my childhood,
                  filled my eyes with gracious tokens, that were not drawn from me by the sublime
                  circling of the sun and moon, then moving east and west in their spheres. The
                  final tone of praise in the great ascription to God is, in its fullness, supplied
                  by a revelation greater than blessed the times of David. A new and sweeter string
                  is strung upon the lyre his royal fingers so nobly swept, and the voice of
                  thanksgiving is more highly raised for an "unspeakable gift." The kingdoms of
                  nature are the chords on the harp we may sound to the Creator of all. There has
                  been of late much discussion as to the<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6523-00000067"/>
                  place nature should hold among religious influences and appeals, some
                  super-eminently exalting her, and others putting her in contrast and almost
                  opposition with all spirit, beauty and truth. This is no place, nor has the
                  present writer inclination, here, to take part in the grand debate, infinitely
                  interesting as it is, on either side. He would only catch, or repeat and prolong
                  the strain of an old and sacred ode—he would contribute a meditation. He would run
                  the matchless ancient verse into a few particulars of fresh and modern
                  illustration, content if he can make no melody of his own, to recall for some,
                  perhaps not enough heeding it, the Hebrew music that has lingered so long on the
                  ear of the world.</p>

               <head>RECOLLECTIONS OF NEANDER, THE CHURCH HISTORIAN.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY THE REV. ROSWELL D. HITCHCOCK, D.D.</head>
               <p>IN the spring of 1848, during the progress of the European revolutions, which
                  promised so much and performed so little, I spent several weeks in Berlin, the
                  capital of Prussia, and saw much, both in public and in private, of "the father of
                  modern church history," whose name I had long revered, and whose image now is one
                  of the choicest treasures of memory. Of all the Christian scholars I have ever
                  known, he stands in my thoughts without a rival; a child in simplicity, a sage in
                  learning, and in broad, catholic and fervent piety, a noble saint. In common with
                  hundreds of my countrymen, I owe him a debt of gratitude, of which this humble
                  tribute to his memory will be but a faint acknowledgment.</p>
               <p>Of Neander's outward history there is but little to be reported; his life was the
                  retired and uneventful ful one of a peculiarly intense and abstracted student. It
                  is hardly a figure of speech, but almost exactly the literal truth to say that he
                  was born, and lived, and died, beneath the shadow of the Universities. He was not,
                  indeed, quite so much of a recluse as his fellow-countryman Kant, the renowned
                  Königsberg philosopher, who, though he reached the age of eighty, and had a
                  reputation which filled all Europe, was never more than thirty-two miles away from
                  the spot where his mother rocked him in his cradle. But considering the ampler
                  means at his command, and the greatly increased facilities for travelling,
                  Neander's neglect of locomotion is nearly as much to be wondered at as Kant's; I
                  doubt if he was ever beyond the boundaries of Germany.</p>
               <p>He was born January 16th, 1789, in Göttingen, a city of some eleven thousand
                  inhabitants in the kingdom of Hanover, the seat of a famous University, which,
                  though now less prominent than formerly, has numbered amongst its professors such
                  men as Blumenbach, Eichhorn, and Michaelis. His parents were of Jewish blood and
                  the Jewish religion, and he inherited from them, in a strong degree, both the
                  peculiar physiognomy and the distinguishing faith of that despised but most
                  remarkable race. Nor was he a Jew only outwardly<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000071"/> wardly; from the beginning he was marked as an
                  Israelite indeed, a true Nathanael soul.</p>
               <p>At an early period in his life, his father having suffered reverses and been
                  reduced to poverty, he removed with his parents to Hamburg, a commercial city on
                  the Elbe, and one of the four free municipalities of Germany. In the Hamburg
                  gymnasium, corresponding in rank with our American academies, though prescribing a
                  wider range of studies, he received his first public instruction. It is related of
                  him, that he used frequently to steal into one of the book-stores, and for hours
                  together sit buried in some rare and erudite volume. And here the original bent of
                  his genius was early developed; subtlety, profoundness, and intense subjectivity
                  of thought were noticed as the distinguishing characteristics of his mind. In a
                  letter from Neumann to Chamisso, bearing date February 11th, 1806, when, of
                  course, he was only seventeen years old, it is said of him: "Plato is his idol,
                  and his perpetual watchword. He pores over that author night and day; and there
                  are probably few who receive him so completely into the sanctuary of the soul. It
                  is surprising to see how all this has been accomplished without any influence from
                  abroad. It proceeds simply from his own reflection and his innate love of study.
                  He has learned to look with indifference upon the outward world." Such was the
                  beginning of his illustrious career. He was thoroughly a Platonist. And it
                  happened to him, as to so many of the early fathers of the church before him; he
                  was led from Plato to Christ. The honored walks of the Academy were exchanged for
                  the manger and the cross; and so he passed from Judaism to philosophy, and from
                  philosophy to faith. "Pray and labor," writes he in one of his letters, "let that
                  be the bass-note, or rather praying merely; for what else should a human, or even
                  a superhuman do than pray?" This was the dawning of the light. Of his progress in
                  the Christian experience, we have no means as yet of tracing the steps. We only
                  know, in general, from what he started, and to what he came.</p>
               <p>In the April of 1806, he joined the University at Halle, where he came under the
                  influence of Schleiermacher, whose learned and thrilling voice was the first to
                  sound the return of infidel Germany to the truth as it is in Jesus. Schleiermacher
                  was then thirty-eight years old, in the first bloom and vigor of his faculties,
                  and made, of necessity, a very profound and durable impression upon the young and
                  ardent Hebrew Platonist, who was already, in obedience to his own impulses,
                  seeking the way of life.</p>
               <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6523-00000072"/>
               <p>He had been in Halle about six months, when the city was captured by the French
                  under Bernadotte. The University was immediately suspended by Napoleon, and the
                  students ordered to disperse. Neander fled, with one of his friends, to Göttingen,
                  the place of his birth, where, joining the University, he came under the
                  instruction of Gesenius, afterward the great Hebrew lexicographer, then but twenty
                  years of age, and just commencing his distinguished career. The manner of their
                  introduction to each other is a curious bit of literary history worth preserving.
                  Gesenius was returning to Göttingen from his native place, Nordhausen, which was
                  then in flames, having been set fire to by the French. The soldiers of the broken
                  Prussian army were hurrying to their homes. In the general flight and confusion,
                  Gesenius saw two young men on their way from Halle to Göttingen, one of whom had
                  broken down, unable to go any further, and was entirely out of money. He procured
                  a carriage for the unknown young student and conveyed him to Göttingen. That young
                  student was Neander; and this little adventure led to a friendship which lasted
                  for life, the gulf which subsequently yawned between them, in respect to matters
                  of faith, abating nothing of their mutual respect and kindliness. "At first it was
                  painful to me," said Neander, writing from Göttingen, "to be thrown into this
                  place of icy coldness for the heart. But now I find it was well, and thank God for
                  it. In no other way could I have made such progress. From every human mediator,
                  and even every agreeable association, must one be torn away, in order that he may
                  place his sole reliance on the only Mediator."</p>
               <p>In 1809 he returned to Hamburg to become a pastor. But the city had a small fund
                  to support one of its theologians as a lecturer at Heidelberg. This was wisely
                  appropriated to Neander, who promised more as a scholar than as a preacher.
                  Accordingly, in 1811, we find him established at Heidelberg as a teacher in the
                  University, he having previously, on his public profession of Christianity,
                  assumed the name of <foreign xml:lang="DEU">Neander,</foreign> deriving it from
                  the Greek, <foreign xml:lang="GRC">νεος ανηρ</foreign>, "a new man," to signify
                  the entire change which had come over him. The family name was Mendel. The year
                  following he was appointed Professor Extraordinary, which, in plain English, means
                  a professor without a regular salary from government, and shortly issued his work
                  on "The Emperor Julian and his Time," the first of those monographs which awakened
                  the admiration of his learned countrymen, and paved the way for the great<pb
                     n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6523-00000073"/> undertaking of his life, "A General
                  History of the Christian Religion and Church."</p>
               <p>In 1813, when but twenty-four years of age, he was called to a professorship in
                  the then recently established University of Berlin, and signalized his removal
                  thither by a work on "St. Bernard and his Age." Five years later, he published a
                  work on Gnosticism, and in 1821, his "Life of Chrysostom;" besides some treatises
                  of minor note, which we need not pause to enumerate. At length, in 1825, when of
                  course he was thirty-six years old, the first volume of his General History of the
                  Church appeared. And to say that this work put him directly at the very head of
                  Christendom as the expounder of its inward life, is saying only what we all know
                  to be true. After that, he turned aside occasionally in obedience to other calls
                  of duty, at one time to write a history of the Apostolic Age, and at another the
                  Life of Christ, but always returning to his General History, as the one great task
                  appointed him of God to do. As I parted with him in the spring of 1848, my heart
                  drawn out toward him with an admiring tenderness and reverence, such as I had
                  never experienced toward any other living scholar, I could not forbear assuring
                  him, that many prayers would go up for him in America as well as in Europe, that
                  he might be spared to complete his work. "I hope it," he replied, "but that must
                  be as God wills." But this wish of his heart was denied him. He died in Berlin on
                  Sunday, July 14th, 1850, in the midst of his unfinished labors. He had published
                  what brings us down to the year 1294, and was then at work upon the centuries
                  which lie between that and the Reformation. The posthumous volume, edited by
                  Schneider, still falls short, by nearly a hundred years, of that important epoch.
                  Had he been spared to proceed thus far, we had been the better reconciled to his
                  dying; although his countrymen were anxious to have him turn his peculiar powers
                  upon the Reformation itself, and the world-wide movements which have grown out of
                  it. But this was not to be. He died, leaving no one to take his mantle; died, too,
                  somewhat prematurely, for he was only sixty-one years old.</p>
               <p>Of his personal appearance, which was altogether unique, descriptions have
                  frequently been given. He was small of stature, his height not exceeding five feet
                  and four or five inches. He had studied so hard, exercised so little, eaten so
                  sparingly and suffered so much from imperfect health, that his muscles seemed
                  entirely relaxed and flabby. His hand, when he gave it in salutation or in
                  parting, was like that of a sick child. But his hair remained<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000074"/> as black as a raven. His brows were shaggy and
                  overhanging, and his black eyes, when ever and anon the drooping lids were lifted
                  away from them, shot forth a very deep and searching light. As one sat over
                  against him, watching his words, he might easily imagine himself gazing through
                  those glowing orbs back into the ages. His study, up two flights of stairs,
                  overlooking one of the public squares of the city, was a place to be remembered.
                  Its furniture was a plain round table, a standing-desk, an old sofa and two or
                  three chairs. High up on the walls between the book-shelves and the ceiling,
                  nearly all round the room, hung engraved portraits of distinguished men; and he
                  showed his noble catholicity of spirit, in having the great men of his native land
                  all there, without regard to their peculiar schools and sentiments. His library
                  contained about 4,000 volumes. They filled the room; table, chairs and sofa were
                  loaded with them; they lay in stacks upon the floor; and, in some cases, were
                  piled, two or three tiers deep, into the shelves against the walls. To anybody
                  else the library would have been a chaos; but he could lay his hand at once upon
                  any book he wished for. It was in this room, thus crammed with books, that he used
                  to entertain the little parties he invited to sup with him. The repast was always
                  frugal; the conversation versation, on his part, such as might have gone into
                  print. A man-servant brought in the refreshments on a tray; or, sometimes, one of
                  his pupils officiated. His only sister, who kept house for him during the greater
                  part of his life, never made her appearance at these exclusively masculine
                  entertainments. He himself rarely paid any attention to the progress of the meal,
                  but seemed to be as much a visitor as any of his guests. The little he needed was
                  soon dispatched, and his thoughts were again afloat, sounding along from theme to
                  theme.</p>
               <p>He never married, and, at the time I speak of, was almost alone in the world.
                  Neither father, nor mother, nor any other near relative remained to him, save his
                  sister, Johanna, whose care of him had need to be almost maternal. Well-nigh every
                  day in the year these two might be seen walking out together to take the air. They
                  went always arm in arm, a beautiful embodiment of the tenderest affection. Hardly
                  the king himself attracted more attention in the street. Scarcely a person he met
                  failed to raise his hat and salute the venerable scholar with the heartiest good
                  will. As he was both short-sighted and suffering from diseased vision, he had to
                  depend upon his sister to know who bowed to him; and it was amusing to see his
                  returning salutation bestowed, in almost every<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000075"/> instance, a little too late. Many anecdotes were
                  afloat in Berlin, and indeed all over Germany, going to illustrate his habits of
                  abstraction and absent-mindedness, some of which no doubt were true, and all of
                  which were likely enough to have been so.</p>
               <p>An exact description of his manners in the lecture-room would, by any one who
                  never saw him, be thought a caricature. He entered the room with his eyes upon the
                  floor, as if feeling his way; a student stood ready to take his hat and overcoat
                  and hang them up in their places; while he went directly to his stand—a high pine
                  desk; threw his left elbow upon it; dropped his head so low that his eyes could
                  not be seen; tilted the desk over on its front legs, so that you expected every
                  moment to see it pitching forward into the lecture-room, with the lecturer after
                  it; and, seizing a quill, always provided for the purpose, began at once to speak,
                  and to twist and twirl and tear in pieces the quill. Sometimes, in the heat of his
                  discourse, he would suddenly jerk up his head, whirl entirely round with his face
                  to the wall and his back to the audience, and then as suddenly whirl back again,
                  his words all the while pouring along in a perfect torrent of involved and fervent
                  thought. Add to this a constant writhing and swinging of his legs, with a frequent
                  slight spitting, produced by a chronic weakness of the salivary glands, and you
                  have a picture of the outward man known in Berlin as John William Augustus
                  Neander; to be known in history as one of the most learned, revered and beloved
                  teachers of our century.</p>
               <p>While it is indispensable to our full and lively appreciation of Neander that
                  these little things be known of him, no one will be so foolish as to let such
                  accidents and eccentricities of the outward life divert his attention from the
                  grand and rarely equalled manhood which lay behind and beneath them. To give
                  anything like a just estimate of this manhood would be no easy task, however. His
                  native endowments, the attainments he had made in the learning pertaining to his
                  department, and the part he was called to play in the regeneration of German
                  science and German faith, were all remarkable. From the first glimpse we catch of
                  him, when, at 17 years of age, he had given his head and heart to Plato, he
                  strikes us as no ordinary character; and our wonder deepens at every step, till at
                  last we behold him sinking exhausted amidst his labors, and all Christendom
                  gathered in sorrow around his grave.</p>
               <p>His native instincts, tastes and sympathies were<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000076"/> all singularly pure and generous. His family
                  attachments were strong. In the latest periods of his life, when she had long been
                  dead, the name of his mother could not be mentioned by him without a visible gush
                  of deep and tender emotion. The loss of his favorite sister, some years before his
                  own departure, almost shattered him. For days he drooped and mourned amongst his
                  books, and could do no work. Only the thought that God had taken her to Himself,
                  and that He doeth all things well, finally availed to quiet him. So of all his
                  friends; he never forgot and was never false to them. But his special care was
                  bestowed upon the young men of the University, who had gathered about him, in the
                  spirit of a most enthusiastic discipleship, out of all Germany, and indeed out of
                  nearly all Christendom. To the last he continued to be a young man himself, as
                  fresh, impulsive and eager, and with as entire a freedom from all appearance of
                  assumption and authority, as though his pupils and he were merely peers. There was
                  at once a warmth, a blandness and a child-like simplicity of manners, which made
                  him the idol of every heart. And he carried the same amenity of temper into all
                  the theological controversies of his life. He never stooped to ungracious
                  personalities, and never seemed to be in pursuit of victory at the expense of
                  truth and fairness. The result was that he was never assailed with personalities
                  in return. Through all the bitterest contentions which raged around him, he was
                  uniformly treated with respect and deference. Not that men were ignorant of his
                  opinions, or thought him neutral, but because he was felt to be an Israelite
                  indeed, in whom there was no guile. He committed himself to no clique, and allowed
                  no clique to be committed to him.</p>
               <p>In his personal habits he was temperate and frugal in the extreme; though not for
                  the sake of accumulation. His income from his books and lectures must have been
                  considerable; but he gave it nearly all away. Hundreds of indigent students could
                  testify to his generosity, while amongst the poor of the city, there were many
                  pensioners upon his bounty.</p>
               <p>In regard to his intellectual gifts and powers, their peculiar cast has already
                  been intimated. The dominant feature of his genius was its deeply subjective and
                  spiritual character. The accidents of a subject never detained him for a moment
                  from his search after the essential and the abiding. Outward circumstances were of
                  little interest to him. And in this direction lay the main defect of his mind; it
                  was too exclusively Platonic, subjective and spiritual. Had his profound Germanic
                     intuitiveness<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6523-00000077"/> tiveness of vision
                  been tempered with a little more of our homely Anglo-Saxon common sense, the
                  combination would have been well-nigh perfect.</p>
               <p>What has just been said of his intellectual peculiarities will help us to
                  understand also his religious life. It was preeminently an inward life; a fire in
                  the very marrow of his being. As it was his own solitary and independent
                  reflection which first turned his feet toward Nazareth and Calvary, so was it by
                  deep and steady communion with his own heart that he advanced in sanctity. The
                  natural and unchanging atmosphere of his life was that of faith and prayer. His
                  religious experience was rooted in peculiarly deep and pungent views of sin. Not
                  that he had gross outward offences to be ashamed of; but he felt the law of evil
                  working within him, disturbing his peace; and he longed for the serenity of a
                  child of God. Thus did he learn his need of Christ. His pupils relate with much
                  interest how, on the evening of one of his birth-day festivals, when they were
                  gathered at his house, he spoke to them of his own spiritual infirmities, and with
                  trembling voice confessed himself a poor sinner seeking forgiveness through
                  atoning blood. Theologically, he was comparatively indifferent in regard to minor
                  points; but he clung with the tenacity of a martyr's faith to the great essentials
                  tials of the Gospel. His religious life was therefore at once very fervent and
                  very catholic. Loving Christ with all the ardor of a passion, he loved with a
                  generous latitude of heart all those of every name in whom he discerned Christ's
                  image. The motto adopted by him as best describing his own aim and method, was
                  that of St. Augustine: "Pectus est quod facit theologum." <emph>It is the heart
                     which makes the theologian.</emph> It was a Divine Form, for which he was ever
                  seeking, while he walked about amongst men, as he walked up and down the centuries
                  of our Christian faith, murmuring to himself: "It is the Lord."</p>
               <p>As a writer of church history, his first great claim to gratitude is on account of
                  the living pulse of faith and love which beats through all his pages. He traces
                  the golden thread of Christian life through the darkest centuries. He does much to
                  save the church of God from reproach, and God's own gracious promise from
                  contempt, by showing how much there has been of Christian grace and truth under
                  the worst forms and in the worst ages. He has thus made his History what he said
                  it should be, "a speaking proof of the Divine power of Christianity, a school of
                  Christian experience, and a voice of edification and warning sounding through all
                  ages for all who are willing to believe."<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6523-00000078"
                  /> Of the original sources of history, particularly for the earlier centuries, his
                  knowledge was profound, and his use of them masterly. How thorough and how fair he
                  is, can be fully appreciated only by those who explore for themselves the
                  fountains from which he drew his materials. His chief defect is in the matter of
                  form. He had but little dramatic power. He gives us the inward life, but not the
                  outward stir and shock of history. Nor is he remarkable for analytical sharpness
                  in his delineation of the growth of Christian doctrine. It is in the sphere of
                  experience and life that he succeeds the best. His own doctrinal views were not,
                  at all points, quite up to our English and American standards of orthodoxy. But
                  these points were of minor importance. All that is cardinal was precious to him.
                  With peculiar fidelity did he cling to the Head, which is Christ, and was full of
                  that faith which conquers the world and saves the soul.</p>
               <p>His last days, as described by his friends and pupils, were in marked keeping with
                  his whole career. On Monday, the 8th of July, at 11 o'clock, he lectured at the
                  University. But he had been for some time back much feebler than usual, the
                  weather was sultry and debilitating, and his system was out of tune. His voice
                  failed him two or three times in the course of the lecture, and it was only by a
                  desperate struggle that he got to the end; his strength barely sufficing to bring
                  him home. The impression upon his class was such, that one of the students,
                  turning to his neighbor, said: "This is the last lecture of our Neander."
                  Immediately after dinner, which he scarcely tasted, his reader came. He dictated
                  on his Church History three hours in succession, repressing by force of will the
                  rising groans, his debility all the while increasing. At 5 o'clock the symptoms of
                  a dangerous illness appeared; but he would not abandon his work. His sister, who
                  came to expostulate with him and warn him against further effort, was sent
                  impatiently away. "Let me alone," he said; "every laborer, I hope, may work if he
                  wishes; wilt thou not grant me this?" At seven he was compelled to pause. His
                  reader gone, his first thought was to call back his much loved sister, and say to
                  her: "Be not anxious, dear Jenny, it is passing away; I know my constitution." But
                  his physicians were agreed in the opinion that the very worst was to be feared.
                  They succeeded, however, in subduing the symptoms of the disease, which was a
                  violent cholera, and began to hope. The next morning, having hardly got breath
                  from this first furious attack, he inquired<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000079"/> with touching sadness, "shall I not be able to
                  lecture to-day?" When answered in the negative, he distinctly demanded that the
                  suspension should be only for that one day. In the afternoon of Tuesday, he called
                  out vehemently for his reader, desired him to go on with Ritter's Palestine, with
                  which he had been occupied, and impatiently blamed the anxiety of his friends who
                  had dismissed his assistant too hastily. He then, according to his daily custom,
                  had another of his pupils read to him the newspaper. He followed the reading with
                  lively attention, making his remarks now of agreement and now of dissent, till at
                  length he fell asleep, and so ended the day's work. Later in the afternoon, while
                  racked with pain, it occurred to him that his sister might think of foregoing
                  sleep on his account, which he begged her not to do. Wednesday he had the
                  newspaper read to him, and made his comments, as usual. Thursday night brought
                  with it a convulsive hiccough. Friday, his spirit was clear, peaceful and full of
                  love. But Friday night extinguished the last hopes of his friends. The pains he
                  endured were excruciating. With an indescribably affecting and deeply tender
                  voice, before which no eye remained tearless, he exclaimed, "Would to God I could
                  sleep." Saturday he was clamorous for the servant to bring him his clothes, that
                  he might dress and go about his work. His sister came: "Think, dear August, what
                  thou hast said to me when I have rebelled against the directions of the physician,
                  'It comes from God, therefore must we acquiesce in it.'" "That is true," answered
                  quickly the softened voice, "it all comes from God, and we must thank him for it."
                  During the day he asked to be taken into the study. The sweet sunlight, streaming
                  on his nearly blinded eyes, refreshed and gladdened him. After this, a bath of
                  wine and strengthening herbs was administered, which seemed to do him good.
                  Finding himself amongst his books again, he rose upon the cushions which supported
                  him, and, to the astonishment of all, began a lecture upon the New Testament, and
                  announced for the coming term a course of lectures upon the Gospel of John. At
                  half-past nine, having inquired the hour, he fell asleep. When he awoke, it was
                  Sunday. There came back a gush of bodily strength, the last leaping of the light
                  before it flickered in the socket. Taking up the thread of his history where he
                  had dropped it two days before, he began to dictate for some one to write. The
                  passage was about the mystics of the 14th and 15th centuries. The concluding
                  sentence was: "So it was in general; the further development is to follow." Then
                     turning<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6523-00000080"/> ing to his sister, he said:
                  "I am tired; let us make ready to go home;" as though they were somewhere on a
                  long and wearisome journey. And then rallying his last energies in one parting
                  word of tenderness to her who was bending over him with a breaking heart, he
                  murmured, "Good night," and died.</p>
               <p>Thus he died with his harness on, not aware, probably, that he was so near his
                  end; else he might have uttered some dying testimony, which would have passed into
                  the literature of the church to be the comfort of other saints in their mortal
                  agony. But, on his own account, no such dying testimony was required. For
                  thirty-seven years he had stood his ground gallantly in Berlin, witnessing for
                  Christ in the face of a learned skepticism, and he could well afford to pass
                  directly, without an interlude, from the toils and conflicts of earth to the joys
                  and triumphs of the redeemed in heaven.</p>
               <p>His labors had been prodigious. He usually lectured not less than fifteen times a
                  week, published twenty-five volumes, and left behind him several other volumes
                  nearly ready for the press. His health was never firm. A rheumatic disease lurked
                  in his system from the time of his illness at Göttingen. Three years before he
                  died, this disease settled in his eyes, and made him nearly blind. But against all
                  impediments, he struggled on, fighting the good fight of faith, patient and
                  resolute, till suddenly his course was finished, and he took his crown.</p>

               <head>THE NEW ENGLAND THANKSGIVING.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY THE REV. HENRY W. BELLOWS, D.D.</head>
               <p>WHEN cellar and barn and storehouse were filled with food for the coming winter,
                  our pious New England forefathers used their first common leisure to make public
                  and joyful acknowledgment of their blessings to the God of sunshine and of rain;
                  to Him, who clothes the valleys with corn, and the hills with flocks. Almost
                  universally, they placed the meeting-houses, where these thanks were rendered, on
                  the hill-top commanding the widest view of the fields from which their prosperity
                  sprung, and nearest to the sky, whence their blessings came. Their modest homes
                  were sheltered from the winds by the barns that held their wealth and overshadowed
                  their low dwellings. The earth was precious in their eyes, as the source of their
                  living. They could spare no fertile or sheltered spot, even for the burial-ground,
                  but economically laid it out in the sand, or on the bleak hill-side; while they
                  threw away no fencing on the house of God, but<pb n="166-167"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000084"/> jealously preserved that costly distinction for
                  their arable lands and orchards. They were farmers; and it was no unmeaning thing
                  for them to keep the harvest feast. They had prayed in drought, with all faith and
                  fervor, for the blessing of rain; in seed-time, for the favoring sunshine and soft
                  showers; and in harvest, that blight and frost might spare their corn; and when in
                  the late autumn, all their prayers had been heard, and their hands and homes were
                  crowned with plenty, their thanksgiving anthem was an incense of the heart, and
                  their honored pastors knew not how to pour out a flood of gratitude too copious
                  for the thankful people's "Amen." A full hour's prayer wearied not their patient
                  knees; and the sermon, with its sixteenthly, finally, and to conclude (before the
                     <emph>improvement,</emph> itself a modern sermon in length), did not outmeasure
                  the people's honest sense of their grounds of thankfulness to God.</p>
               <p>The landscape appropriate to thanksgiving is not furnished by brick walls and
                  stone pavements. It is a rural festival. The smoke from scattered cottages should
                  be slowly curling its way through frosty air. As we look forth from the low porch
                  of the homestead, the ground lightly covered with snow, stretches off to a not
                  distant horizon, broken irregularly with hills, clothed in spots with evergreens
                  greens, but oftener with bare woods. The distant and infrequent sleigh-bells, with
                  the smart crack of the rifle from the shooting match in the hollow, strike
                  percussively upon the ear. Vast piles of fuel, part neatly corded, part lying in
                  huge logs, with heaps of brush, barricade the brown, paintless farmhouses. Swine,
                  hanging by the ham-strings in the neighboring shed; the barn-yard speckled with
                  the ruffled poultry, some sedate with recent bereavement, others cackling with a
                  dim sense of temporary reprieve; the rough-coated steer butting in the fold, where
                  the timid sheep huddle together in the corner; little boys on a single skate
                  improving the newly frozen horse-pond—these furnish the foreground of the picture
                  during the earlier hours of the morning. Later in the day, without, the sound of
                  church bells, the farmers' pungs, or the double sleighs, with incredible numbers
                  stowed in their strawed bottoms, drive up to the meeting-house door. An occasional
                  wagon from the hills, from which the snow has blown, with the crunching, whistling
                  sound of wheels upon snow, sets the teeth of the crowd in the porch on edge, as it
                  grinds its way to the stone steps to deposit its load. Great white coats, with
                  seven or eight capes apiece, dismount, and muffs and moccasins—each a whole
                  bearskin—follow. Long stoves, with live coals<pb n="168-169"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000085"/> got at the neighboring houses, occasionally join
                  the procession. Few come afoot; for our pious ancestors seemed to think it as much
                  a part of their religion to fill the family horse-shed as the family pew; and in
                  good weather would send a mile to pasture for the horses to drive a half mile to
                  meeting. But, meeting out, the parson's prayer and sermon said, the choir's
                  ambitious anthem lustily sung, the politics of the prayer, and the politics of the
                  sermon, both summarily criticised, approved, condemned, partly with looks and
                  winks, and partly with loud words in the porch, there is now a little space for
                  kind inquiries after the absent, the sick, and the poor; a few solitary spinsters,
                  and one old soldier, lame and indigent, are seized on and carried off to homes,
                  where certain blessed Mothers in Israel, are wont to keep a vacant chair for a
                  poor soul that might feel desolate if left alone on this sociable day. Some
                  full-handed visits are paid on the way home to scattered and rickety houses; but
                  by one o'clock, all the people are beneath their own roofs, never so attractive as
                  on this glorious day. The married children from the neighboring towns have come
                  home, and the old house is full.</p>
               <p>The great event of the day is at hand. It is dinner-time. The table of unnatural
                  length, narrower at one end, where it has been eked out for the occasion, groans
                  with the choicest gifts of the year. There is but one course, but that possesses
                  infinite variety and reckless profusion. For one day, at least, the doctrine of an
                  apostle is in full honor. "For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be
                  refused, if it be received with thanksgiving." The long grace sanctifies the feast
                  with the word of God and with prayer. The elders and males are distributed to
                  front the substantials of the board—the round of <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >a-la-mode,</foreign> the brown crisp pig with an apple in his mouth, the great
                  turkey who has frightened the little red-cloaked girls and saucy pugs for months
                  past, the chicken-pie with infinite crimping and stars and knobs, decorating its
                  snowy face. The mothers and daughters are placed over against the puddings and
                  pies, which have exercised their ambition for weeks—vying with rival housekeepers
                  in the number and variety of sorts—and which, after the faint impression made on
                  them to-day, shall be found for a month, filling the shelves of spare-closets and
                  lending a delicious though slightly musty odor to the best wardrobe of the family.
                  Children of all ages—to the toddling darling, the last babe of the youngest
                  daughter—fill up the interstices, while the few books in the house are barely
                  sufficient to bring the<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6523-00000086"/> little ones in
                  their low chairs to an effective level with the table. Incredible stowage having
                  been effected, the sleepy after-dinner hours are somewhat heavily passed; but with
                  the lamps and the tea-board, sociability revives. The evening passes among the old
                  people, with chequers and back-gammon. Puss-in-the-corner, the game of
                  forfeits—blindman's-buff entertain the young folks. Apples, nuts and cider come in
                  at nine o'clock, and perhaps a mug of flip—but it is rather for form's sake than
                  for appetite. At ten o'clock the fire is raked up, and the household is a-bed.
                  Excepting some bad-dreams, Thanksgiving day is over.</p>

               <head>A NIGHT AND DAY AT VALPARAISO.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY ROBERT TOMES.</head>
               <p>AS night came on, the steamer doubled the rocky cape, and, steaming with all its
                  engine force, stood right for Valparaiso. Her speed soon slackened, and she began
                  to feel her way cautiously, going ahead, backing, turning, and coming to a full
                  stop. "Let go the anchor," was now the word, followed by a hoarse rumble of the
                  chains and a noisy burst of steam. A fleet of shadowy ships and small craft
                  surrounded us, and ahead glimmered the lights of the city, which, irregularly
                  scattered about the dark hill-sides, appeared in the night like so many stars
                  dimly twinkling through a broken rain cloud. With the quick instinct of the
                  presence of a stranger, the dogs became at once conscious of our arrival, and
                  began a noisy welcome of barks and yelps, which continued throughout the night.
                  The port officials in tarnished gilt came alongside the steamer, had their talk
                  with the captain and pushed off again. Two or three gusty-looking<pb n="174-175"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000088"/> ing sea-captains boarded us, gave their rough
                  grasps of welcome, drank off their stiff supplies of grog, and pulled back to
                  their ships. Some few of the more impatient of our comrades turned out from the
                  bottom of their trunks their "best," and went ashore in glossy coats and shining
                  boots. Most of us, however, awaited the coming of the morning.</p>
               <p>I was up on deck at the earliest dawn of day. The steamer was at anchor close
                  before the city, and I looked with no admiring eyes upon its flimsy white-washed
                  houses and wooden spires, scattered about the base and sides of the cindery,
                  earth-quaky hills upon which it is built. There was hardly a blade of grass or
                  tree to be seen anywhere, except where the thriving European and American
                  residents had perched themselves on one of the acclivities. The dwarfed trees
                  here, moreover, all in a row before the little painted bird-cage-looking houses,
                  appeared to have no more life of growth and color in them than so many painted
                  semblances in a toy village. Familiar looking shanties, of the tumble-down sort,
                  built of pine wood and shingles, crowded the ground by the water side, and indeed
                  the low land seemed better suited to their staggering aspect than the steep
                  acclivities. Painted signs with English names and English words, stared familiarly
                  from every building. The universal "John Smith" there conspicuously posted his
                  name and his "Bakery." Mine host of the "Hole in the Wall" invited the thirsty in
                  good round Saxon to drink of his "Best Beer on Tap," or his "Bottled Porter," as
                  "you pays your money and take your choice."</p>
               <p>The steamer was enlivened from the earliest hour by the native fishermen, who,
                  with their fleet of canoes, had sought the shades of our dark hull, to protect
                  them from the hot sun, which seemed to be fairly simmering the waters of the bay.
                  They were making most miraculous draughts of fishes. I watched one little fellow.
                  He was hardly a dozen years of age, but he plied his trade with such skill and
                  enterprise, that he nearly filled his canoe during the half hour I was watching
                  him. It was terrible to see with what intense energy and cruelty the little yellow
                  devil, with bared arms blooded to the shoulders, pounced upon his prey. With a
                  quick jerk he pulled his fish in, then clutching it with one hand and thrusting
                  the fingers of the other with the prompt ferocity of a young tiger into the
                  panting gills, he tore off with a single wrench the head, and threw the body, yet
                  quivering with life, among the lifeless heap of his victims lying at the bottom of
                  his boat. The sea gulls, hovering about shrieking shrilly and pouncing upon the
                  heads and entrails as<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6523-00000089"/> they were thrown
                  into the water, fighting over them and gulping them down with hungry voracity,
                  seemed to heighten this picture of the "Gentle art of angling."</p>
               <p>The return of the steward and chaplain with a boat load of "marketing" was a
                  welcome surprise. The parson, whose unquestionable taste in the æsthetics of
                  eating had been wisely secured by the steward, dilated with great gusto upon the
                  juicy beefsteaks, the freshness of the fish, and the richness of the fruit. When,
                  at breakfast, we enjoyed as salt-sea voyagers only could, the stores of fresh
                  meat, fresh eggs, fresh butter, fresh milk, juicy grapes, white and purple, with
                  the morning's bloom still upon them, the peaches, the apples, the pears, the tumas
                  (prickly pear fruit) the melons, musk and water, we acknowledged his reverence's
                  judgment, and gratefully thanked him for his services.</p>
               <p>On landing to take a look at the town, I made my way through a throng of boatmen,
                  of picturesque native fruitsellers and loitering sailors, to the chief business
                  street, which ran along the shore. The stores, which were mainly under the
                  proprietorship of the foreign merchants, had a rich, thriving look, being crammed
                  full of miscellaneous goods, while the sidewalks were heaped with bales and boxes.
                  Odd-looking carts moved slowly along with their drivers in picturesque costume
                  lying in full length upon their loads, smoking their cigarettes, and looking
                  wondrously lazy and happy. Stately Chilians from the interior, dressed in genuine
                  Era Diavolo style, rode by on their prancing horses, all glistening and jingling
                  with silver. There were abundant loungers about, in the cool shade of every corner
                  and projecting roof. The listless men with the universal poncho—an oblong mantle
                  of variegated cotton or woollen, through a hole in the centre of which the head is
                  thrust, allowing the garment to hang in folds about the person—looked as if they
                  had been roused suddenly from their beds, and not finding their coats at hand, had
                  walked out with their coverlets over their shoulders. The women, too, in their
                  loose dresses and with shawls thrown carelessly over their heads, had a very
                  bed-chamber look. They were mostly pretty brunettes, with large, slumbering black
                  eyes, which, however, were sufficiently awake to ogle effectively.</p>
               <p>Having a letter of introduction to present, I entered the counting-house of the
                  merchant whose acquaintance I sought. I found him boxed off at the further end of
                  his long, heaped-up warehouse. He had closed his ledger, lighted his cigar, and
                  had just filled his glass from a bottle of wine which<pb n="178-179"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000090"/> stood on the window-sill, when I entered. I was not
                  surprised, under such provocation to good fellowship, to receive a warm welcome.
                  My mercantile friend was in the best possible humor, for times, he said, were very
                  good. Every one at Valparaiso was making his fortune. It was the epoch of the gold
                  excitement. Large fortunes had already been made. The contents of the shops and
                  warehouses had, as soon as the gold discovery became known, been emptied into
                  every vessel in the harbor, and sent to San Francisco. The lucky speculators had
                  gained five or six hundred per cent. profit for their ventures of preserved and
                  dried fruits, champagne, other wines and liquors, Madeira nuts and the most paltry
                  stuff imaginable. In five months some of the Valparaiso merchants had cleared five
                  hundred thousand dollars. The excitement was still unabated. Shippers were still
                  loading and dispatching their goods daily for San Francisco. Many were going there
                  themselves, and hardly a clerk could be kept at Valparaiso at any salary, however
                  large.</p>
               <p>The day was brilliantly bright, and the air so pure and bracing that it did the
                  lungs good to breathe. So I made my way out of counting-house and street for a
                  walk. I ascended the dry, crumbling hills which with long, deep gullies and breaks
                  in them, and friable soil, looked as if they were ready to tumble into pieces at
                  the first shake of one of those earthquakes so frequent in the country. On the
                  road, chained gangs of surly convicts were at work, and some smart-looking
                  soldiers, in blue and white, came marching along! Caravans of mules, laden with
                  goods, produce and water casks, trotted on, and here and there rode a dashing
                  Chilian cavalier on his prancing steed, or a dapper citizen on his steady cob. In
                  a ravine between the dry hills there trickled the smallest possible stream. Above,
                  some water carriers were slowly filling their casks, while the mules patiently
                  waited for their burdens; below, was a throng of washerwomen, beating their
                  clothes upon the stones, just moistened by the scant water which flowed over them,
                  and interchanging Spanish Billingsgate with each other and a gang of man-of-war
                  sailors.</p>
               <p>Frightened away by the stony stare of the English occupant from an
                  imposing-looking residence on the top of the hill, I crossed the road and entered
                  the private hospital. Around a quadrangle, laid out in gardens beds there was a
                  range of low two story buildings. Some bleached sailors, in duck trowsers and blue
                  jackets, were about; one was reading a song-book, another his Bible, and a third
                  was busily making a marine swab out of ropes' ends.<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000091"/> Among the convalescents, out on the balconies to
                  catch a breath of the pure air, was a naval officer in a gilt cap, reading a
                  novel; and all looked snug and encouraging. On entering, I asked the attendant, a
                  gaunt-looking Englishman, who in his musty black suit, was not unlike a carrion
                  crow or a turkey buzzard, whether there was any serious case of illness in the
                  hospital. "There are two consumptives," said he, "who've been a deceiving us for
                  the last two weeks." He seemed to think it a very base fraud that these two
                  consumptives had not died when he and the doctor thought it was their duty to do
                  so, some fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Coming from the one hill to another, I reached a miserable quarter of the town,
                  called by the sailors the "foretop." It was composed of rude mud hovels, stuffed
                  with a population of half-breeds, a half-naked gipsy-looking people, grovelling in
                  the dirt, and breathing an atmosphere reeking with the stench of filth, garlic and
                  frying fat. I was glad to escape, and get to the "Star Hotel," where, refreshing
                  myself with a chop and brown stout, I could fancy myself, with hardly an effort of
                  the imagination, taking my dinner at an ordinary in the Strand.</p>

               <head>PAID FOR BY THE PAGE.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY EDWARD S. GOULD.</head>
               <p>THE labourer is worthy of his hire. A man who produces an available "article" for
                  a newspaper or a periodical, is as properly entitled to a pecuniary recompense, as
                  a doctor, or a lawyer, or a clergyman, for professional services; or, as a
                  merchant or a mechanic for his transferable property. This is a simple
                  proposition, which nobody disputes. The rate of such compensation must be a matter
                  of agreement. As between author and publisher, custom seems to have fixed on what
                  an arithmetician would call "square measure," as the basis of the bargain; and the
                  question of adjustment is simplified down to "how much by the column, or the
                  page?"</p>
               <p>This system has its advantages in a business point of view; because, when the
                  price, or rate, is agreed on, nothing remains but to count the pages. Whether the
                  publisher or the writer is benefited by this plan of computation, in a literary
                  point of view, may, however, be doubted.</p>
               <p>A man who is paid <emph>by the page</emph> for his literary labour, has every
                  inducement but one to expand lines into sentences, sentences into paragraphs, and
                  paragraphs into extravagant dimensions. An idea, to him, is a thing to be
                  manufactured into words, each of which has a money value; and if he can, by that
                  simplest of all processes—a verbal dilution—give to one idea the expansive power
                  of twelve; if he can manage to spread over six pages what would be much better
                  said in half a page, he gains twelve prices for his commodity, instead of one; and
                  he sacrifices nothing but the quality of his commodity—and <emph>that</emph> is no
                  sacrifice, so long as his publisher and his readers do not detect it.</p>
               <p>When a man writes for reputation, he has a very different task before him; for no
                  one will gain high and permanent rank as an author, unless his ideas bear some
                  tolerable proportion to his words. He who aims to write <emph>well,</emph> will
                  avoid diffuseness. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Multum in parvo</foreign> will be his
                  first consideration; and if he achieves that, he will have secured one of the
                  prime requisites of literary fame.</p>
               <p>In the earlier days of our republic, a discussion was held by several of the
                  prominent statesmen of the period, on the expediency of extending the right of
                  suffrage to others than freeholders. Some of the debaters made long speeches;
                  others made<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6523-00000095"/> short ones. At length, Mr.
                  JAY was called on for his views of the matter. His brief response was: "Gentlemen,
                  in my opinion, <emph>those who own the country ought to rule it.</emph>" If that
                  distinguished patriot had been writing for the bleeding Kansas Quarterly, at the
                  rate of a dollar a page, he would probably have expanded this remark. He might
                  have written thus:</p>
               <p>"Every man is born free and independent; or, if he is not, he ought to be.
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">E pluribus unum.</foreign> He is, moreover, the natural
                  proprietor of the soil; for the soil, without him, is nothing worth. He came from
                  the soil; he lives on the soil; and he must return to the soil. <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">De gustibus, non est disputandum.</foreign> So much for man in
                  his natural state, breathing his natural air, surrounded by his natural horizon,
                  and luxuriating in his natural prerogatives. But this is a very limited view of
                  the question. Man is expansive, aggressive, acquisitive. <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >Vox populi, vox Dei.</foreign> Having acquired, he wills to acquire.
                  Acquisition suggests acquisition. Conquest promotes conquest. And, speaking of
                  conquests, the greatest of all conquests is that which a man obtains over
                  himself—provided always that he does obtain it. This secured, he may consider
                  himself up to anything. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Arma virumque cano.</foreign>
                  Owning the soil by right of possession; owning himself by right of conquest; and,
                  being about to establish a form of government conformable to his own views of
                  right and wrong; let him protect the right, confound the wrong, and make his own
                  selection of subordinate officers. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Mus cucurrit plenum
                     sed.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>This, by way of illustration. The Jay style sounds the best: the dollar-a-page
                  style pays the best. But the dollar-a-page system is a very bad one for the
                  well-being of our newspaper and 'periodical literature, simply because the chief
                  inducement is on the wrong side. If an author receives twice as much pay for a
                  page as for half a page, he will write a page as a matter of course; and, as a
                  matter of course, the quality of what he writes will be depreciated in geometrical
                  proportion. For the same thing, said in few words, is ten times more effectual
                  than when said in many words.</p>
               <p>No doubt, different subjects require different handling, and more space is needed
                  for some than for others. An essay is not necessarily too long because it fills
                  five columns, or fifty pages; but periodical and newspaper writing demands
                  compactness, conciseness, concentration; and the fact of being paid by
                  measurement, is a writer's ever-present temptation to disregard this demand.</p>
               <p>The conceit of estimating the value of an article by its length and rating the
                  longest at the highest<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6523-00000096"/> price, is about
                  as wise as to estimate a man by his inches instead of his intellect.</p>
               <p>Certain names there are in the literary world, which carry great weight in a
                  reader's regard, independently of the quality of the contributions. If a Sir
                  Walter Scott were to write for the <title>North American Review,</title> he would
                  temporarily elevate the reputation of the Review, however carelessly he might
                  throw his sentences together. But, theoretically, the articles in our periodical
                  literature are anonymous; and, practically, they stand on their intrinsic merits.
                  And it is out of the question that a system which offers a money premium for the
                  worst fault in periodical writing—to wit, prolixity—should not deteriorate the
                  character of such writing.</p>
               <p>Much more might be said on this subject; but, to the wise, a word is sufficient.
                  And it would ill become one who is endeavouring to recommend conciseness, to
                  disfigure that very endeavour by diffuseness.</p>

               <head type="sub">(PASSAGES FROM A MANUSCRIPT SERMON.)</head>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>THE OFFERING OF CONTRITION.</head>
                  <p>THAT deepest lowliness of all—the prostration before God, the prostration in
                     penitence—is the highest honor that humanity can achieve. It is the first great
                     cardinal requisition in the Gospel; and it is not meant to degrade, but to
                     exalt us. Self-condemnation is the loftiest testimony that can be given to
                     virtue. It is a testimony paid at the expense of all our pride. It is no
                     ordinary offering. A man may sacrifice his life to what he calls honor, or
                     conceives to be patriotism, who never paid the homage of an honest tear for his
                     own faults. That was a beautiful idea of the poet, who made the boon that was
                     to restore a wandering shade to the bliss of humanity—a boon sought through all
                     the realm of nature and existence—to consist, not in wealth or splendor, not in
                        regal<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6523-00000098"/> mercy or canonized glory,
                     but in a tear of penitence. Temple and altar, charity and pity, and martyrdom,
                     sunk before that.</p>
                  <p>I have seen the magnificence of all ceremonial in worship; and this was the
                     thought that struck me then. Permit me to describe the scene, and to express
                     the thought that rose in my mind, as I gazed upon it. It was in the great
                     cathedral church of the world; and it brings a kind of religious impression
                     over my mind to recall its awfulness and majesty. Above, far above me, rose a
                     dome, gilded and covered with mosaic pictures, and vast as the pantheon of old
                     Rome; the four pillars which supported it, each of them as large as many of our
                     churches; and the entire mass, lifted to five times the height of this
                     building—its own height swelling far beyond; no dome so sublime but that of
                     heaven was ever spread above mortal eye. And beyond this dome, beneath which I
                     stood, stretched away into dimness and obscurity the mighty roofing of this
                     stupendous temple—arches behind arches, fretted with gold, and touched with the
                     rays of the morning sun. Around me, a wilderness of marble; with colors as
                     variegated and rich as our autumnal woods; columns, pillars, altars, tombs,
                     statues, pictures set in ever-during stone; objects to strike the beholder with
                     never-ceasing ceasing wonder. And on this mighty pavement, stood a multitude of
                     many thousands; and through bright lines of soldiery, stretching far down the
                     majestic nave, slowly advanced a solemn and stately procession, clothed with
                     purple, and crimson, and white, and blazing with rubies and diamonds; slowly it
                     advanced amidst kneeling crowds and strains of heavenly music; and so it
                     compassed about the altar of God, to perform the great commemorative rite of
                     Christ's resurrection. Expect from me no sectarian deprecation; it was a goodly
                     rite, and fitly performed. But, amidst solemn utterances, and lowly
                     prostrations, and pealing anthems, and rising incense, and all the surrounding
                     magnificence of the scene, shall I tell you what was my thought? One sigh of
                     contrition, one tear of repentance, one humble prayer to God, though breathed
                     in a crypt of the darkest catacomb, is worth all the splendors of this gorgeous
                     ceremonial and this glorious temple.</p>

                  <p>And let me add, that upon many a lowly bosom, the gem of virtue shines more
                     bright and beautiful than it is ever likely to shine in any court of royalty or
                     crown of empire: and this, for the very<pb n="196-197"
                        xml:id="VAC6523-00000099"/> reason that it shines in loneliness and
                     obscurity, and is surrounded with no circlet of gazing and flattering eyes.
                     There <emph>are</emph> positions in life, in society, where all loveliness is
                     seen and noted; chronicled in men's admiring comments, and perhaps celebrated
                     in adulatory sonnets and songs. And well, perhaps, that it is so. I would not
                     repress the admiration of society toward the lovely and good. But there is many
                     a lowly cottage, many a lowly bedside of sickness and pain, to which genius
                     brings no offering; to which the footsteps of the enthusiastic and admiring
                     never come; to which there is <emph>no</emph> cheering visitation—but the
                     visitation of angels! <emph>There</emph> is humble toil—<emph>there</emph> is
                     patient assiduity—<emph>there</emph> is noble
                        disinterestedness—<emph>there</emph> is heroic sacrifice and unshaken truth.
                     The great world passes by, and it toils on in silence; to its gentle footstep,
                     there are no echoing praises; around its modest beauty, gathers no circle of
                     admirers. It never thought of honor; it never asked to be known. Unsung,
                     unrecorded, is the labor of its life, and shall be, till the heavens be no
                     more; till the great day of revelation comes; till the great promise of Jesus
                     is fulfilled; till the last shall be first, and the lowliest shall be loftiest;
                     and the poverty of the world shall be the riches and glory of heaven.</p>

               <head>THOUGHTS UPON FENELON.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY THE REV. SAMUEL OSGOOD, D.D.</head>
               <p>FENELON died at Cambray, January 7, 1715, aged 64, some years after the death of
                  Bossuet, his antagonist, and shortly before the death of his royal patron and
                  persecutor, Louis XIV. The conscience of Christendom has already judged between
                  the two parties. Never was the spirit of the good archbishop more powerful than
                  now. Whilst ambitious ecclesiastics may honor more the name of Bossuet, the heart
                  of France has embalmed in its affections the name of his victim, and our common
                  humanity has incorporated him into its body. When Fenelon's remains were
                  discovered in 1804, the French people shouted with joy that Jacobinism had not
                  scattered his ashes, and a monument to his memory was forthwith decreed by
                  Napoleon. In 1826, his statue was erected in Cambray, and three years after, a
                  memorial more eloquent than any statue, a selection from his works, exhibiting the
                  leading features of his mind, bore witness of his power and goodness to this
                  western world. The graceful monument which the wife of Follen thus reared to his
                  memory was crowned by the hand of Channing with a garland that as yet has shown no
                  trace of decay.</p>
               <p>To any conversant with that little work, or with the larger productions of
                  Fenelon's mind, need I say a single word of tribute to his character or gifts? Yet
                  something must be said to show the compass of his character, for common eulogium
                  is too indiscriminate in praise, exaggerating certain amiable graces at the
                  expense of more commanding virtues.</p>
               <p>He was remarkable for the harmony of his various qualities. In his intellect,
                  reason, understanding, fancy, imagination, were balanced in an almost unexampled
                  degree. The equilibrium of his character showed itself alike in the exquisite
                  propriety of his writings and the careful and generous economy of his substance.
                  He died without property and without debt. Some critics have denied him the praise
                  of philosophical depth. They should rather say, that his love of prying
                  analytically into the secret principles of things was counterbalanced by the
                  desire to exhibit principles in practical combination, and by his preference of
                  truth and virtue in its living portraiture to moral anatomizing or metaphysical
                  dissection. He could grapple wisely<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6523-00000103"/>
                  with the fatalism of Malebranche and the pantheism of Spinosa, as his
                  controversial works show; he could hold an even argument with the terrible Bossuet
                  on the essence of Christianity. He preferred, however, to exhibit under forms far
                  more winning than controversy, his views of human agency, divine power, and
                  Christian love. The beautiful structure of his narratives, dialogues, and letters,
                  is not the graceful cloak that hides a poverty of philosophical ideas. It is like
                  the covering which the Creator has thrown around the human frame, not to disguise
                  its emptiness, but to incase its energies, and to ease and beautify its action.
                  With this reservation, we will allow it to be said that his mind was more graceful
                  than strong.</p>
               <p>His heart was equally balanced with his intellect. Piety and humanity, dignity and
                  humility, justice and mercy, blended in the happiest equilibrium. His gentleness
                  never led him to forget due self-respect, or forego any opportunity of speaking
                  unwelcome truths. Bossuet and Louis, in their pride, as well as young Burgundy, in
                  his confiding attachment, had more than one occasion to recognize the singular
                  truthfulness of this gentle spirit. Measured by prevalent standards, his character
                  may be said to lack one element—fear. His life was love. The text that the beloved
                  disciple drew from his Master's ter's bosom was the constant lesson of his soul:
                  "He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love."</p>
               <p>His active powers were great, for he filled with efficiency posts of duty so
                  various as to call for different orders of ability. Priest, preceptor, prelate, as
                  well as statesman, poet, orator, theologian, he was eminent in every capacity, and
                  in each sphere took something from his distinction by being rival of himself in
                  other spheres. Take him for all in all—allowing to other men superior excellence
                  in single departments—where can we find a man on the whole so perfect as he
                  was?</p>
               <p>I am well aware that he has not escaped disparagement, and that the animadversions
                  of his contemporary, St. Simon, have been more than repeated in the suspicions of
                  the over-skeptical historian Michelet. True, that the courtesy that won the hearts
                  alike of master and servant, the high-born lady who sought his society and the
                  broken-spirited widow who asked his Christian counsel, has been ascribed to a love
                  of praise that rejoiced in every person's homage, or a far-sighted policy that
                  desired every person's suffrage. True, that his self-denial has been called a deep
                  self-interest that would win high honors by refusing to accept the less rewards.
                  True, that his piety has sometimes<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6523-00000104"/> been
                  called sentimentalism, and an alloy of baser emotion has been hinted at as running
                  through some of his letters to enthusiastic devotees. True, that he has been
                  called very politic and ambitious. We claim for him no superhuman perfection. Nor
                  do we deny that he was a Frenchman, whilst we maintain that he was every inch a
                  man.</p>
               <p>But let him be judged not by a skeptical suspicion that doubts from the habit of
                  doubting of virtue, but by the spirit of his whole life. That life, from beginning
                  to end, was an example of the virtue commended by our Lord in his charge to his
                  apostles. Sent forth like a lamb in the midst of wolves, he blended the wisdom of
                  the serpent with the gentleness of the dove. Whatever failings he may have had he
                  conquered. His course was ever onward to the mark whither he deemed himself called
                  of God.</p>
               <p>We probably have often felt, on reading Fenelon, as if his sweetness of temper
                  were sometimes at the expense of his manliness, and we could easily spare some of
                  his honeyed words for an occasional flow of hearty, even if bitter, indignation.
                  To his credit, however, be it said, that with him gentle speech was often but the
                  smooth edge of faithful counsel most resolutely pointed and sharpened at the
                  consciences of the great whom rudeness would offend and inelegance gance disgust.
                  Recent discoveries have given ample proof of his unflinching boldness to the
                  French Court. During his banishment (1694-97) he wrote that masterly and fearless
                  letter to Louis XIV., which was not discovered until 1825, and which the most
                  earnest of his eulogists, not even Channing, we believe, seems to have noted. Than
                  these intrepid words, Christian heroism cannot further go.</p>
               <p>Would that there were time to speak of his works in their various departments,
                  especially those in the departments of education, social morals, and religion.</p>
               <p>No name stands above his among the leaders in the great cause of education. None
                  surpass him in the power with which he defended the mind of woman from the
                  impoverishing and distorting systems prevalent in his day, and by his example and
                  pen taught parents to educate their daughters in a manner that should rebuke
                  vanity and deceit, and blend grace with utility. None went before him in knowledge
                  of the art of taming obstinate boyhood into tenderness, and with all modern
                  improvements our best teachers may find in his works a mine of knowledge and
                  incentive both in their tasks of instruction and discipline.</p>
               <p>In social morals he was a great reformer; not, indeed, so remarkable for being
                  engrossed with<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6523-00000105"/> some favorite
                  innovation, as for urging the constant need of applying Christian truth and duty
                  to every social institution. He rebuked the passion for war, by his own demeanor
                  disarmed the hostility of combatants, and by his instructions struck at the root
                  of warfare in the councils of princes. We may well be amazed at his political
                  wisdom, and taught more emphatically than ever that we are to look for this not to
                  the hack-politicians who think only of the cabals of the moment, but to the sage
                  men who interpret the future from the high ground of reason and right. His
                  political papers embody the lessons that France has since learned by a baptism of
                  blood. Hardly a single principle now deemed necessary for the peace and prosperity
                  of nations, can be named, that cannot be found expressed or implied in Fenelon's
                  various advice to the royal youth under his charge. Well may the better minds of
                  France and Christendom honor his name for the noble liberality with which he
                  qualified the mild conservatism so congenial with his temperament, creed and
                  position.</p>
               <p>As a theologian, he constantly breathes one engrossing sentiment. With him,
                  Christianity was the love of God and its morality was the love of the neighbor.
                  Judged by occasional expressions, his piety might seem too ascetic and
                  mystical—too urgent of penance and self-crucifixion—too enthusiastic in emotion,
                  perilling the sobriety of reason in the impassioned fervors of devotion—sometimes
                  bordering upon that overstrained spiritualism, which, in its impulsive flights, is
                  so apt to lose its just balance and sink to the earth and the empire of the
                  senses. He has written some things that prudence, nay, wisdom, might wish to
                  erase. But, qualified by other statements, and above all, interpreted by his own
                  life, his religion appears in its true proportion—without gloom, without
                  extravagance. To his honor be it spoken, that in an age when priests and prelates
                  eminent for saintly piety sanctioned the scourging and death of heretics, and
                  enforced the Gospel chiefly by the fears of perdition, Fenelon was censured for
                  dwelling too much on the power of love, that perfect charity that casteth out
                  fear. It may, perhaps, be a failing with him that he had too little sympathy with
                  the fears and passions of men, and appreciated too little the more sublime and
                  terrible aspects of Divine Providence. His mind was tuned too gently to answer to
                  all of the grandest music of our humanity, and we must abate something of our
                  admiration of him for his want of loyalty to the new ages of Christian thought and
                  heroism. He evidently loved Virgil more than Dante, Cicero more than Chrysostom,
                  and thought<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6523-00000106"/> the Greek Parthenon, in its
                  horizontal lines and sensuous beauty, a grander and more perfect structure, alike
                  in plan and execution, than Notre Dame or Strasbourg Cathedral, with its uplifting
                  points and spiritual sublimity. He was a Christianized Greek, who had exchanged
                  the philosopher's robe for the archbishop's surplice.</p>
               <p>Viewing him now on the whole, considering at once his gifts and graces of mind,
                  and heart, and will; his offerings upon the altar of learning, humanity and
                  religion, we sum up our judgment in a single saying. He worshipped God in the
                     <emph>beauty</emph> of holiness. His whole being, with all its graces and
                  powers so harmoniously combined, was an offering to God that men cannot but admire
                  and the Most High will not despise.</p>
               <p>We may not take leave of Fenelon without applying to our times the teachings of
                  his spirit, the lesson of his life. However rich the topic in occasion for
                  controversial argument, we defer all strife to the inspiration of his gentle and
                  loving wisdom. Let an incident connected with the tomb of Fenelon furnish us an
                  emblem of the spirit in which we shall look upon his name. His remains were
                  deposited in the vault beneath the main altar at which he had so often ministered.
                  It would seem as if some guardian-angel shielded them from desecration. Eighty
                  years passed and the Reign of Terror came upon France in retribution for her
                  falsity to her best advisers. The allied armies were marshalling their hosts
                  against the new republic. Every means must be used to add to the public resources,
                  and the decree went forth that even the tombs should be robbed of their coffins.
                  The republican administrator of the District of Cambray, Bernard Cannonne, in
                  company with a butcher and two artillery-men, entered the cathedral and went down
                  into the vault which held the ashes of so many prelates. The leaden coffins with
                  their contents were carried away and placed upon the cars; but when they came to
                  the inclosure whose tablet bore the name of Fenelon, and lifted it from its bed,
                  it appeared that the lead had become unsoldered and they could take away the
                  coffin and leave the sacred dust it had contained. Years passed, and the reign of
                  Napoleon bringing a better day, rebuked the Vandalism that would dishonor all
                  greatness and spoil even its grave. The facts regarding the acts of desecration
                  were legally ascertained and the bones of the good archbishop triumphantly
                  reserved for a nobler than the ancient sepulchre. There was a poetical justice in
                  the preservation of them from violence. It was well that the bloody revolutionists
                  who went to the<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6523-00000107"/> tombs for metal to
                  furnish their arsenals, were made, in spite of themselves, to respect the ashes of
                  one whose counsels of duty heeded would have averted that revolution by a system
                  of timely concessions and benignant legislation.</p>
               <p>Now that we virtually draw near the resting-place of this good man, let it not be
                  to furnish material for bullets of lead or paper to hurl against theological
                  antagonists. Appreciating the beauty of his spirit, let us learn and apply the
                  rebuke and encouragement it affords. A genius so rare we may not hope to approach
                  or imitate. Graces still more precious and imitable are associated with that
                  genius and create its highest charm. Our time has been worse than thrown away, and
                  our study of his works and his biographies has been in vain, if we are not better,
                  more wise, and earnest, and gentle for the page of history, the illustration of
                  divine providence that has now come before us. Placed in the most perplexing
                  relations, he never lost hold of the calm wisdom that was his chosen guide.
                  Exposed to the most irritating provocations, he never gave up the gentle
                  peacefulness of his spirit.</p>
               <p>Our age is not peculiarly ecclesiastical, yet we have not done with the church and
                  its teachers. Many a time of late we have had cause to think with regret of the
                  persuasive eloquence of the Archbishop of Cambray, of the sacred Art that could
                  make truth lovely to wayward youth, and religion beautiful to hard and skeptical
                  manhood. Has it not sometimes seemed as if ambitious prelacy had forgotten the
                  purer example for the baser, and copied Bossuet's pride instead of Fenelon's
                  charity? Nay, has not priestly assumption coveted the talons and forgotten the
                  wings of the Eagle of Meaux and lost sight wholly of the Dove of Cambray? What
                  government or ruler in Christendom would not be the better for a counsellor as
                  eloquent and fearless as he who dared rebuke without reserve the great Louis of
                  France in words like these:</p>
               <p>"You do not love God; you do not even fear him but with a slave's fear; it is hell
                  and not God whom you fear. Your religion consists but in superstitions, in petty
                  superficialities. You are like the Jews, of whom God said: '<emph>Whilst they
                     honor me with their lips, their hearts are far from me.</emph> You are
                  scrupulous upon trifles and hardened upon terrible evils. You love only your own
                  glory and comfort. You refer everything to yourself as if you were the God of the
                  earth, and everything else here created only to be sacrificed to you. It is you,
                  on the contrary, whom God has put into the world only for your people."</p>

               <head>A STORY OF VENICE.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS.</head>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>WHEN I was in Venice I knew the Marchesa Negropontini. Many strangers knew her
                     twenty and thirty years ago. In my time she was old and somewhat withdrawn from
                     society; but as I had been a fellow-student and friend of her grand-nephew in
                     Vienna, I was admitted into her house familiarly, until the old lady felt as
                     kindly toward me, as if I, too, had been a nephew.</p>
                  <p>Italian life and character are different enough from ours. They are
                     traditionally romantic. But we are apt to disbelieve in the romance which we
                     hear from those concerned. I cannot disbelieve, since I knew this sad, stern
                     Italian woman. Can you disbelieve, who have seen Titian's, and Tintoretto's,
                     and Paolo Veronese's portraits of Venetian women? You, who have floated about
                     the canals of Venice?</p>
                  <p>I was an American boy; and my very utter<pb n="218-219"
                        xml:id="VAC6523-00000110"/> strangeness probably made it easier for the
                     Marchesa Negropontini to tell me the story, which I now relate. She told it to
                     me as we sat one evening in the balcony of her house, the palazzo Orfeo, on the
                     Grand Canal.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>The Marchesa sat for a long time silent, and we watched the phantom life of the
                     city around us. Presently she sighed deeply and said:</p>
                  <p>"Ah, me! it is the eve of the Purification. My son, seventy years ago to-day
                     the woman was born whose connection with the house of Negropontini has shrouded
                     it in gloom, like the portrait you have seen in the saloon. Seventy years ago
                     to-day my father's neighbor, the Count Balbo, saw for the first time the face
                     of the first daughter his wife had given him. The countess lay motionless—the
                     flame of existence flickered between life and death.</p>
                  <p>"'Adorable Mother of God!' said the count, as he knelt by her bedside, 'if thou
                     restorest my wife, my daughter shall be consecrated to thy service.'</p>
                  <p>"The slow hours dragged heavily by. The mother lived.</p>
                  <p>"My brother Camillo and I were but two and our years older than our little
                     neighbor. We were children together, and each other's playmates. When the
                     little neighbor, Sulpizia Balbo, was fourteen, Camillo was eighteen. My son,
                     the sky of Venice never shone on a more beautiful girl, on a youth more grave
                     and tender. He loved her with his whole soul. Gran' Dio! 'tis the old, old
                     story!</p>
                  <p>"She was proud, wayward, passionate, with a splendor of wit and unusual
                     intelligence. He was calm, sweet, wise; with a depthless tenderness of passion.
                     But Sulpizia inherited her will from her father, and at fourteen she was
                     sacrificed to the vow he had made. She was buried alive in the convent of our
                     Lady of the Isle, and my brother's heart with her.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>"Sulpizia's powerful nature chafed in the narrow bounds of the convent
                     discipline. But her religious education assured her that that discipline was so
                     much the more necessary, and she struggled with the sirens of worldly desire.
                     The other sisters were shocked and surprised, at one moment by her surpassing
                     fervor, at another by her bold and startling protests against their miserable
                     bondage.</p>
                  <p>"Often, at vespers, in the dim twilight of the chapel, she flung back her cape
                     and hood, with the<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6523-00000111"/> tears raining
                     from her eyes and her voice gushing and throbbing with the melancholy music,
                     while the nuns paused in their singing, appalled by the religious ecstasy of
                     Sulpizia. She was so sweet and gentle in her daily intercourse that all of them
                     loved her, bending to her caresses like grain to the breeze; but they trembled
                     in the power of her denunciation, which shook their faith to the centre, for it
                     seemed to be the voice of a faith so much profounder.</p>
                  <p>"While she was yet young she was elected abbess of the convent. It was a day of
                     triumph for her powerful family. Perhaps the Count Balbo may have sometimes
                     regretted that solemn vow, but he never betrayed repentance. Perhaps he would
                     have been more secretly satisfied by the triumphant worldly career of a woman
                     like his daughter, but he never said so.</p>
                  <p>"Sulpizia knew that my brother loved her. I think she loved him—at least I
                     thought so.</p>
                  <p>"The nuns were not jealous of her rule, for the superior genius which commanded
                     them also consoled and counselled; and her protests becoming less frequent, her
                     persuasive affection won all their hearts. They saw that the first fire of
                     youth slowly saddened in her eyes. Her mien became even more lofty; her voice
                     less salient; and a shadow fell gently over her life. The sisters thought it
                     was age; but Sulpizia was young. Others thought it was care; but her duties
                     could not harass such a spirit. Others thought it was repentance; but natures
                     like hers do not early repent.</p>
                  <p>"It was resolved that the portrait of the abbess should be painted, and the
                     nuns applied to her parents to select the artist. They, in turn, consulted my
                     brother Camillo, who was the friend of the family, and for whom the Count Balbo
                     would, I believe, have willingly unvowed his vow. Camillo had left Venice as
                     the great door of the convent closed behind his life and love. He fled over the
                     globe. He lost himself in new scenes, in new employments. He took the wings of
                     the morning, and flew to the uttermost parts of the earth,<ref rend="super"
                        target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref> and there he found—himself.
                     So he returned an older and a colder man. His love, which had been a passion,
                     seemed to settle into a principle. His life was consecrated to one remembrance.
                     It did not dare to have a hope.</p>

                  </note>
                  <p>"He brought with him a friend whom he had met in the East. Together upon the
                     summit of the great pyramid they had seen the day break over Cairo, and on the
                     plain of Thebes had listened for<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6523-00000112"/>
                     Memnon to gush with music as the sun struck him with his rod of light. Together
                     they had travelled over the sea-like desert, breaking the awful silence only
                     with words that did not profane it. My brother conversing with wise sadness—his
                     friend Luigi with hope and enthusiasm.</p>
                  <p>"Luigi was a poor man, and an artist. My brother was proud, but real grief
                     prunes the foolish side of pride, while it fosters the nobler. It was a rare
                     and noble friendship. Rare, because pride often interferes with friendships
                     among men, where all conditions are not equal. Noble, because the two men were
                     so, although only one had the name and the means of a nobleman. But he shared
                     these with his friend, as naturally as his friend shared his thoughts with him.
                     Neither spoke much of the past. My brother had rolled a stone over the mouth of
                     that tomb, and his friend was occupied with the suggestions and the richness of
                     the life around him. If some stray leaf or blossom fell forward upon their path
                     from the past, it served to Luigi only as a stimulating mystery.</p>
                  <p>"'This is my memory,' he would say, touching his portfolio, which was full of
                     eastern sketches. 'These are the hieroglyphics Egypt has herself written, and
                     we can decipher them at leisure upon your languid lagunes.'</p>
                  <p>"It was not difficult for my brother to persuade Luigi to return with him to
                     Venice. I shall not forget the night they came, as long as I remember
                     anything."</p>
                  <p>The Marchesa paused a moment, dreamily.</p>
                  <p>"It was the eve of the Purification," she said, at length, pausing again. After
                     a little, she resumed:</p>
                  <p>"We were ignorant of the probable time of Camillo's return; and about sunset my
                     mother, my younger sister Fiora, and I, were rowing along the Guidecca, when I
                     saw a gondola approaching, containing two persons only beside the rowers,
                     followed by another with trunks and servants. I have always watched curiously
                     new arrivals in Venice, for no other city in the world can be entered with such
                     peculiar emotion. I had scarcely looked at the new comers before I recognized
                     my brother, and was fascinated by the appearance of his companion, who lay in a
                     trance of delight with the beauty of the place and the hour.</p>
                  <p>"His long hair flowed from under his slouched hat, hanging about a face that I
                     cannot describe; and his negligent travelling dress did not conceal the
                     springing grace of his figure. But to me, educated in Venice, associated only
                     with its silent, stately nobles; a child, early solemnized by the society of
                     decay and of elders whose hearts were<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6523-00000113"
                     /> never young, to me the magnetic charm of the young man was his youth, and I
                     gazed at him with the same admiring earnestness with which he looked at the
                     city and the scene.</p>
                  <p>"The gondolas constantly approached. My brother lay lost in thoughts which were
                     visible in the shadow they cast upon his features. His head rested upon his
                     hand, and he looked fixedly toward the island on which the convent stands. A
                     light summer cloak was drawn around him, and hid his figure entirely, except
                     his arm and hand. His cap was drawn down over his eyes. He was not conscious of
                     any being in the world but Sulpizia.</p>
                  <p>"Suddenly from the convent tower the sound of the vesper bell trembled in
                     throbbing music over the water. It seemed to ring every soul to prayer. My
                     brother did not move. He still gazed intently at the island, and the tears
                     stole from his eyes. Luigi crossed himself. We did the same, and murmured an
                     Ave Maria.</p>
                  <p>"'Heavens! Camillo!' cried my mother, suddenly. He started, and was so near
                     that there was a mutual recognition. In a moment the gondolas were side by
                     side, and the greetings of a brother and sisters and mother long parted,
                     followed. Meanwhile, Camillo's companion remained silent, having respectfully
                     removed his hat, and looking as if he felt his presence to be profane at such a
                     moment. But my brother turned, and taking him by the hand, said:</p>
                  <p>"'Dear mother, I might well have stayed away from you twice as long, could I
                     have hoped to find a friend like this.'</p>
                  <p>"His companion smiled at the generosity of his introduction. He greeted us all
                     cordially and cheerfully, and the light fading rapidly, we rowed on in the
                     early starlight. The gondolas slid side by side, and there was a constant hum
                     of talk.</p>
                  <p>"I alone was silent. I felt a sympathy with Camillo which I had never known
                     before. The tears came into my eyes as I watched him gently conversing with my
                     mother, turning now and then in some conversation with Luigi and my younger
                     sister. How I watched Luigi! How I caught the words that were not addressed to
                     me! How my heart throbbed at his sweet, humorous laugh, in which my sister
                     joined, while his eyes wandered wonderingly toward mine, as if to ask why I was
                     so silent. I tried to see that they fastened upon me with special interest. I
                     could not do it. Gracious and gentle to all, I could not perceive that his
                     manner toward me was different, and I felt a new sorrow.</p>
                  <p>"So we glided over the Lagune into the canal, and beneath the balconied
                     palaces, until we reached<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6523-00000114"/> our own.
                     The gondolas stopped. Luigi leaped out instantly upon the broad marble
                     pavement, and assisted my mother to alight, then my sister. Then I placed my
                     hand in his, and my heart stood still. It was a moment, but it was also an age.
                     The next instant I stood free upon the step. Free—but bound forever.</p>
                  <p>"We were passing up the staircase into the palace, Luigi plucked an orange bud
                     and handed it to me. I was infinitely happy!</p>
                  <p>"A few steps further, and he broke an acacia for my sister: ah! I was
                     miserable!</p>
                  <p>"We ascended into the great saloon, and a cheerful evening followed. Fascinated
                     by these first impressions of Venice, Luigi abandoned himself to his abundant
                     genius, and left us at midnight, mutually enchanted. Youth and sympathy had
                     overcome all other considerations. We had planned endless days of enjoyment. He
                     had promised to show us his sketches. It was not until our mother asked of my
                     brother who he was, that all the human facts appeared.</p>
                  <p>"'Heavens!' shouted my younger sister, Fiora, laughing with delight, 'think of
                     the <emph>noble</emph> Marchese Cicada, who simpers, <foreign xml:lang="ITA"
                        >per Bacco,</foreign> that the day is warm, and, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">per
                        dieci,</foreign> that I am lovelier than ever. Viva Luigi! Viva O il
                     pittore.'</p>
                  <p>"'My daughter,' said my grave, cautious mother, 'you are very young yet—you do
                     not understand these things. Good night, my child!'</p>
                  <p>"Fiora kissed her on the brow, and darted out of the room as if she were really
                     alive.</p>
                  <p>"When she had gone, Camillo smiled in his cold, calm way, and turning to me,
                     asked how I liked Luigi. I answered calmly, for I was of the same blood as my
                     brother. I did not disguise how much superior I thought him to the youth I
                     knew. I was very glad he had found such a friend, and hoped the young man would
                     come often to see us, and be very successful in his profession.</p>
                  <p>"Then I was silent. I did not say that I had never lived until that evening. I
                     did not say how my heart was chilled, because, in leaving the room, Luigi's
                     last glance had not been for me, but for Fiora.</p>
                  <p>"Camillo did not praise him much. It was not his way; but I felt how deeply he
                     honored and loved him, and was rejoiced to think that necessity would often
                     bring us together; only my mother seemed serious, and I knew what her gravity
                     meant.</p>
                  <p>"'Do not be alarmed, dear mother,' I said to her, as I was leaving the
                     room.</p>
                  <p>"'My daughter,' she answered, with infinite pride, 'it is not possible. I do
                     not understand<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6523-00000115"/> you. And you, my
                     daughter, you do not understand yourself nor the world."</p>
                  <p>"She was mistaken. Myself I did understand; the world I did not."</p>
                  <p>Again the Marchesa was silent and tears stood in her eyes. She was seventy
                     years old. Yes, but in love's calendar there is no December.</p>
                  <p>"The days passed, and we saw Luigi constantly. He was very busy, but found
                     plenty of time to be with us. His paintings were full of the same kind of power
                     I felt in his character. He never wearied of the gorgeous atmospheric effects
                     of which Titian and Paul, Giorgione and Tintoretto were the old worshippers.
                     They touched him sometimes with a voluptuous melancholy in which he found a
                     deeper inspiration.</p>
                  <p>"Every day I loved him more and more, and nobody suspected it. He did not,
                     because he was only glad to be in my society when he wanted criticism. He liked
                     me as an intelligent woman. He loved Fiora as a bewitching child.</p>
                  <p>"My mother watched us all, and soon saw there was nothing to fear. I sought to
                     be lively—to frequent society; for I knew if my health failed I should be sent
                     away from Venice and Luigi. He had given me a drawing—a scene composed from our
                     first meeting upon the Lagune. The very soul of evening repose brooded upon the
                     picture. It had even an indefinable tone of sadness, as if he had incorporated
                     into it the sound of the vesper bell. It had been simply a melancholy sound to
                     him. To the rest of us, who loved Camillo, it was something more than that. In
                     his heart the mere remembrance of the island rang melancholy vespers
                     forever.</p>
                  <p>"This drawing I kept in a private drawer. At night, when I went to my chamber,
                     I opened the drawer and looked at it. It lay so that I did not need to touch
                     it; and as I gazed at it, I saw all his own character, and all that I had felt
                     and lived since that evening.</p>
                  <p>"At length the day came, on which the parents of Sulpizia came to my brother to
                     speak of her portrait. Camillo listened to them quietly, and mentioned his
                     friend Luigi as a man who could understand Sulpizia, and therefore paint her
                     portrait. The parents were satisfied. It was an unusual thing; but at that
                     time, as at all times, a great many unusual things could be done in convents,
                     especially if one had a brother, who was Cardinal Balbo.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6523-00000116"/>
                  <head>IV.</head>
                  <p>"It was a bright morning that Camillo carried Luigi in his gondola to the
                     convent. He had merely said to him that there was a beautiful abbess to paint,
                     an old friend of his; and Luigi replied that he would always willingly desert
                     beautiful waters and skies for beautiful eyes. They reached the island"——</p>
                  <p>The Marchesa beat the floor slowly with her foot, and controlled herself, as if
                     a spasm of mortal agony had seized her.</p>
                  <p>"They reached the island, and stepped ashore into the convent garden. They went
                     into the little parlor, and presently the abbess entered veiled. My brother,
                     who had not seen her since she was his playmate, could not pierce the veil; and
                     as calmly as ever told her briefly the name of his friend, said a few generous
                     words of him, and, rising, promised to call at sunset for Luigi, and
                     departed."</p>
                  <p>The Marchesa now spoke very rapidly.</p>
                  <p>"I do not well know—nobody knows—but Sulpizia raised her veil, and Luigi
                     adjusted his easel. He painted—they conversed—the day fled away. Sunset came.
                     Camillo arrived in his gondola, and Luigi came out without smiling. The
                     gondoliers pulled toward the city.</p>
                  <p>"'Is she beautiful?' asked Camillo.</p>
                  <p>"'Wonderful,' responded his friend, and said no more. He trailed his hands in
                     the water, and then wiped them across his brow. He took off his hat and faced
                     the evening breeze from the sea. He cried to the gondoliers that they were
                     lazy—that the gondola did not move. It was darting like a wind over the
                     water.</p>
                  <p>"The next day they returned to the island—and the next. But at sunset, Luigi
                     did not come to the gondola. Camillo waited, and sat until it was quite dark.
                     Then he went through the garden of the convent, and inquired for the painter.
                     They sought him in the parlor. He was not there. The abbess was not there. Upon
                     the easel stood her portrait partly finished—strangely beautiful. Camillo had
                     followed into the room, and stood suddenly before the picture. He had not seen
                     Sulpizia since she was a child. Even his fancy had scarcely dreamed of a face
                     so beautiful. His knees trembled as he stood, and he fell before it in the
                     attitude of prayer. The last red flash of daylight fell upon the picture. The
                     eyes smiled—the lips were slightly parted—a glow of awakening life trembled all
                     through the features.</p>
                  <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6523-00000117"/>
                  <p>"The strong man's heart was melted, and the nuns beheld him kneeling and
                     weeping before the portrait of their abbess.</p>
                  <p>"But where was she?</p>
                  <p>"Nobody knew. There was no clue—except that the gondola of the convent was
                     gone.</p>
                  <p>"Camillo took the portrait and stepped into his gondola. He returned to the
                     city, to the palace of Sulpizia's parents. Slowly he went up the great
                     staircase, dark and silent, up which his eager steps had followed the flying
                     feet of Sulpizia. He entered the saloon slowly, like a man who carries a heavy
                     burden—but rather in his heart than in his hands.</p>
                  <p>"'It is all that remains to you of your daughter,' said he in a low voice,
                     throwing back his cloak, and revealing the marvellous beauty of their child's
                     portrait to the amazed parents. Then came the agony—a child lost—a friend
                     false.</p>
                  <p>"Camillo returned to us and told the tale. I felt my heart wither and grow old.
                     My mother was grieved in her heart for her son's sorrow—in her pride for its
                     kind and method. Fiora did not smile any more. Her step was no longer bounding
                     upon the floor and the stairs, and the year afterward she married the Marchese
                     Cicada.</p>
                  <p>"The next day, Camillo returned to the island. The abbess had not returned, nor
                     had any tidings been received. Only the gondola had been found in the morning
                     in its usual place. The days passed. A new abbess was chosen. The church did
                     not dare to curse the fugitive, for there was no proof that she had willingly
                     gone away. It might be supposed—it could not be proved. Camillo hung in his
                     chamber the unfinished portrait, and a black veil shrouded it from chance and
                     curious eyes. He did not seem altered. He was still calm and grave—still cold
                     and sweet in his general intercourse.</p>
                  <p>"My friendship with him became more intimate. He saw that I was much
                     changed—for although pride can do much, the heart is stronger than the head.
                     But he had no suspicion of the truth. People who suffer intensely often forget
                     that there are other sufferers in the world, you know. Camillo was very tender
                     toward me, for he thought that I was paying the penalty of too warm a sympathy
                     with him, and often begged me not to wear away my health and youth in
                     commiseration for what was past and hopeless. I cultivated my consciousness of
                     his suffering as a defence against my own. We never mentioned the names of
                     either of those of whom we were always thinking; but once in many months he
                     would call me into his<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6523-00000118"/> chamber and
                     remove the veil from the portrait, while we stood before it as silent as
                     devotees in a church before the picture of the Madonna. Camillo pursued his
                     affairs—the cares of his estate—the duties of society. He assembled all the
                     strangers of distinction at his table. Yes, it was a rare and great
                     triumph.</p>
                  <p>"For myself, I was mistress of my secret, and I reveal it to you for the first
                     time. Why not? I am seventy years old. You know none of the persons—you hear it
                     as you would read a romance. My heart was broken—my faith was lost—and I have
                     never met since any one who could restore it. I distrust the sweetest smile if
                     it move me deeply, and although men may sometimes be sincere, yet sorrow is so
                     sure that we must steer by memory, not by hope. In this world we must not play
                     that we are happy. That play has a frightful forfeit. Society is wise. It eats
                     its own children, whose consolation is that after this world there is
                     another—and a better, say the priests. Of course—for it could not be a
                     worse.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>V.</head>
                  <p>"Suddenly Sulpizia returned. My brother was in his library when a messenger
                     came for him from her parents. He ran breathless and pale to his gondola. The
                     man was conquered in that moment and the wild passion of the boy flamed up
                     again. When he reached the Balbo palace he paused a moment, despite himself,
                     upon the stairs, and the calmness of the man returned to him. Nature is kind in
                     that to her noble children. Their regrets, their despairs, their lightning
                     flashes of hope, she does not reveal to those who cause them. Every man is
                     weak, but the weakness of the strong man is hidden. He entered the saloon.
                     There stood Sulpizia with her parents.</p>
                  <p>"Death and victory were in her eyes. They were fearfully hollow; and the
                     strongly-carved features, from which the flesh had fallen during the long
                     struggles of the soul, were pure and pale as marble. It seemed as if she must
                     fall from weakness, but not a muscle moved.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing was said. Camillo stood before the woman who had always ruled his
                     soul, to whom it was still loyal. The parents stood appalled behind their
                     daughter. It was a wintry noon in Venice—cold and still.</p>
                  <p>"'Camillo,' said Sulpizia at length, in a tone not to be described, but
                     seemingly destitute of emotion—as the ocean might seem when a gale calmed
                     it—'he has left me.'</p>
                  <p>"Child, I have not fathomed the human heart;<pb n="236-237"
                        xml:id="VAC6523-00000119"/> but after a long, long silence my brother
                     answered only, I know not from what feeling of duty and of sacrifice:</p>
                  <p>"'Sulpizia, will you marry me?'</p>
                  <p>"Cardinal Balbo arranged the matter at Rome, and after a short time they were
                     married. I was the only one present with the parents of Sulpizia, who were glad
                     enough so to cover what they called their daughter's shame. My mother would not
                     come, but left Venice that very day and died abroad. The circumstances of the
                     marriage were not comprehended; but the old friends of the family came
                     occasionally to make solemn, stately visits, which my brother scrupulously
                     returned.</p>
                  <p>"You may believe that we enjoyed a kind of mournful peace after the dark days
                     of the last few years. I loved Sulpizia, but her cheerfulness without smiling
                     was the awful serenity of wintry sunlight. She faded day by day. It was clear
                     to us that the end was not far away.</p>
                  <p>"Two years after the marriage, Sulpizia was lying upon a couch in the room
                     behind us, where you have seen the veiled portrait which hung in my brother's
                     chamber. All the long windows and doors were open and we sat by her side,
                     talking gently in whispers. I knew that death was at hand, but I rejoiced to
                     think that much as he had suffered, there was one bitter drop that had been
                     spared him.</p>
                  <p>"Sulpizia's voice was scarcely audible, and the deadly pallor deepened every
                     moment upon her face. Camillo bent over her without speaking, and bowed his
                     head. I stood apart. In a little while she seemed to be unconscious of our
                     presence. Her eyes were open and her glance was toward the window, but her few
                     words showed her mind to be wandering. Still a few moments, and her lips moved
                     inaudibly, she lifted her hands to Camillo's face and drew it toward her own
                     with infinite tenderness. His listening soul heard one word only—the glimmering
                     phantom of sound—it was 'Luigi.'</p>
                  <p>"His head bowed more profoundly. Sulpizia's eyes were closed. I crossed her
                     hands upon her breast. I touched my brother—he started a moment—looked at me,
                     at his wife, and sunk slowly, senseless by the couch."</p>

               <p>THE date is September 5, 1857. I am at Haworth, whither I had walked from the
                  Bradford Station, some ten or twelve miles distant. This Haworth—a place but a few
                  years since quite unknown to any but the few residing in its immediate vicinity—is
                  built upon the side of a hill, and, with its long line of grey houses creeping up
                  the slope, seems like a huge saurian monster, sprawling along the hill-side, his
                  head near the top and his tail reaching nearly to the vale below. At the summit,
                  in the very head of our saurian, stands Haworth Parsonage, and the church near by,
                  with the square old tower rising above the houses that cluster about it. I well
                  remember my first view of this place. It was an autumn afternoon, and near sunset.
                  The sky had been cloudy, but as I stopped to take my first long look at the little
                  village, so hallowed by the memory of the Brontë sisters, the declining sun sent
                  through a breach in the clouds a few spears of dazzling light, that played about
                  the old church and parsonage with an ineffable glory. It lasted but a few moments,
                  the sun went down, and darkness and night gradually settled over the scene. The
                  little incident seemed almost like a type of the life of the gifted woman chiefly
                  to whom Haworth owes its fame; for her life, like this very day, had been dark and
                  wearisome, overshadowed by clouds of cares, tears falling like rain-drops upon
                  newmade graves, until near its close, when there came a sweet season of bright
                  domestic happiness, that lasted too shortly, and then gave place to the darkness
                  and night of death.</p>
               <p>Strolling through the village, after my quiet meal at the Black Bull Inn, which
                  poor Branwell Brontë had so often frequented, I stopped to make some trifling
                  purchases at a stationery store, and casually asked the proprietor—a small,
                  delicate-looking man, with a bright eye and a highly intellectual countenance—if
                  he remembered the Brontë sisters. It was a fortunate question, for he knew them
                  well, and was a personal friend of the authoress of Jane Eyre, to whose
                  handsomely-framed portrait he<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6523-00000124"/> proudly
                  pointed. He had provided her, as he said, with joyful delight, with the paper on
                  which she wrote the manuscripts of most of her novels; he is referred to in one of
                  Miss Brontë's letters to Mrs. Gaskell, as her "one friend in Haworth," and is the
                  "working-man" mentioned in her memoirs, who wrote a little <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >critique</foreign> on Jane Eyre, that came to the notice of the authoress and
                  afforded her great pleasure. To talk of the Brontë girls—to express his admiration
                  of them to one who had come from America to visit their home and grave, was to him
                  a great gratification. He told me how he used to meet them on the moors—how they
                  were accustomed to stroll all three together, and talk and gather flowers; then
                  how Emily died, and Anne and Charlotte were left to pace the familiar path
                  arm-in-arm; then how they took Anne away to the sea-side, whence she never
                  returned, while Charlotte would take her lonely moorland walk, rapt in sad
                  contemplation. Sometimes he would meet her on these occasions, and if he passed by
                  without attracting her attention, she would chide him when told of it afterward.
                  She was always so kind, so good-hearted, and with those she knew, so really
                  sociable.</p>
               <p>Sunday, with my new friend, I attended the church. The storm of the day before had
                  cleared away, and even the place of graves looked bright and cheerful. The
                  churchyard was crowded with country people from miles around, who sat carelessly
                  on the long, flat stones that so thickly covered the ground, waiting for the
                  opening services, while the parish bell kept up a merry peal. Everything seemed
                  simple and happy, and I do not wonder that the Brontës loved their home, with its
                  little garden of lilac bushes, the old church in front, and the sweeping moors
                  stretching far behind. On many a Sunday morning like this they had trodden the
                  very path I then was treading, and had entered the church-door; but how few of
                  these simple villagers knew the treasures of genius showered on these quiet,
                  reserved sisters!</p>
               <p>The church inside is old, and quaint, and simple; it can neither be called
                  elegant, comfortable, spacious nor antique. Old Mr. Brontë was to preach, and the
                  Rev. Mr. Nicholls read the service. As a compliment to a stranger, I had been
                  invited by the organist of the church to play the organ—a neat little instrument
                  of some eight or ten stops; and it was while "giving out" the familiar tune of
                  Antioch that I noticed, in the reflection of a little mirror placed above the
                  keyboard, that Mr. Brontë had entered the church, and was passing up the aisle. He
                  wore the customary black gown, and the lower<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000125"/> part of his face was quite buried in an enormous
                  white neckcloth—the most monstrous article of the kind I had ever beheld. The
                  reflection in that little mirror I shall never forget. The old man, walking feebly
                  up the aisle, shading his eyes with his right hand, and supporting himself with a
                  cane, the quiet congregation, and the singular dress and venerable bald head of
                  the old preacher, all formed a character-picture, that is not often seen. His
                  sermon was extempore, and consisted of a series of running paraphrases and simple
                  and touching explanations upon a few verses selected from the Lamentations of
                  Jeremiah.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>After church, my friend the stationer walked with me on the moors. Charlotte
                  Brontë's experience of the world was so very limited, that in drawing the
                  characters in her novels, she had to select the real, living people in the
                  vicinity. Thus, my friend pointed out one house and another to me as being the
                  residence of many of the originals of many of the characters in her works,
                  especially in "Shirley." Soon, however, our path across the moors took us out of
                  human habitations, and among the moorland solitudes the Brontë sisters so fondly
                  loved. Cold and desolate as they appear from a distance, a nearer examination
                  proves them to be replete with exquisite site beauty. Delicate heather-blooms
                  carpet the immense slope, and bend like nodding plumes, in graceful waves, to the
                  breezes that play heedlessly down the hill-side. Gay yellow buttercups, bright
                  purple heath-flowers, and dark bilberries, vary the general violet tint, while the
                  tiny stems of these gentle plants spring from rich tufts of emerald moss, and are
                  pushed aside by the spray-like leaves of the wild fern. The hum of bees imparts a
                  half busy, half drowsy sound to the scene, while far down the long easy slopes are
                  little valleys, through which trickle talkative brooks, that sometimes peep
                  between the low foliage on their margins, and are the next moment lost to sight
                  behind the crowding bushes. It is no wonder that Charlotte and her sisters loved
                  their quiet walks along the moors.</p>
               <p>The next day I bade farewell to Haworth. It is now frequently included in the
                  route of American tourists, by many of whom the memory of Charlotte Brontë is as
                  fondly cherished as by her own countrymen and women; and Haworth is no longer the
                  quiet, unknown Yorkshire hamlet that it was a few years ago.</p>

               <head>JUNE TWENTY-NINTH, EIGHTEEN FIFTY-NINE.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY CAROLINE M. KIRKLAND.</head>
               <p>TO talk about the weather is the natural English and American mode of beginning an
                  acquaintance.</p>
               <p>This day—the one that glares upon us at our present writing—is eminently able to
                  melt away what is called the frost of ceremony, and to induce the primmest of us
                  to throw off all disguises that can possibly be dispensed with. It is a day to
                  bring the most sophisticated back to first principles. The very thought of
                  wrapping anything up in mystery, to-day, brings a thrill like the involuntary
                  protest of the soul against cruelty. We are not even as anxious as usual to cover
                  up our faults. We hesitate at enveloping a letter.</p>
               <p>The shimmer that lives and moves over yonder dry fallow, as if ten thousand
                  million fairies were fanning themselves with midges' wings, fatigues the eye with
                  a notion of unnecessary exertion. Wiser seems yon glassy pool, moveless, under
                  heavy, not<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6523-00000128"/> melancholy, boughs. That is
                  reflecting—keeping one pleasant thought all the time—satisfying itself with one
                  picture for a whole morning, as we all did while the "Heart of the Andes" was laid
                  open to our longing gaze. The pool has the advantage of us, too; for it receives
                  into its wave-less bosom the loveliness of sky and tree without emotion, while we,
                  gazing on the wondrous transcript made by mortal man of these measureless glories,
                  felt our souls stirred, even to pain, with a sense of the artist's power, and of
                  the amount of his precious life that must have gone into such a creation.</p>
               <p>By the way, if we had energy enough to-day to wish anything, it would be to find
                  ourselves far away amid flashing seas and wild winds, hunting icebergs, with
                  Church for our Columbus, his banner of <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Excelsior</foreign>
                  streaming over us, his wondrous eye piercing the distant wreaths of spray, in
                  search of domes and pinnacles of opal and lapis lazuli, turned, now to diamonds,
                  now to marble, by sun and shade. One whose good fortune it was to be with the
                  young discoverer at Niagara, came away with the feeling of having acquired a new
                  sense, by the potent magic of genius.</p>
               <p>But to-day, Art is nothing—genius is nothing—but no! that is blasphemous. It is we
                  that are nothing—if not stupid. Dullness is the universe. The grasshoppers are too
                  faint to sing, the birds sit still on the boughs, waiting for the leaves to fan
                  them. Children are wilted into silence and slumberous nonentity; boys do not bathe
                  to-day—they welter, hour after hour, in the dark water near the shaded rock. Even
                  they and the tadpoles can hardly be seen to wriggle. The cow has found a shade,
                  and, preferring repose to munching, lies contented under the one great elm
                  mercifully left in the middle of her pasture.</p>
               <p>A hot day in June is hotter than any other hot day. It finds us cruelly unguarded.
                  After we have been gently baked awhile, the crust thus acquired makes us somewhat
                  tortoise-like and quiescent. If we were condemned to suffer thirty-nine stripes,
                  or even only as many as belong to our flag, would it or would it not be a
                  privilege to take them by degrees, say one on the first day, two on the second,
                  four on the third, etc., in the celebrated progression style, until the whole were
                  accomplished? Or were it better to have the whole at once, and so be done with it?
                  In either case, or in present case, what a blessing to be made pachydermatous! (a
                  learned word lately acquired by ladies, though doubtless long familiar to
                  lords).</p>
               <p>But words beginning with the sound of <emph>ice,</emph> are<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC6523-00000129"/> more agreeable for to-day—such as icicle,
                  isolation, Islip.</p>
               <p>Some unhappy critic has said that the "icicle that hangs on Diana's temple" is not
                  colder than other icicles. We pity him, and would like to try the comparison
                  to-day. We have already tried "thinking on the frosty Caucasus," and quite agree
                  with Claudio—was it, or Romeo, or who?—that this is of no service in case of
                  fire.</p>
               <p>Delicious music for to-day—the tinkling of ice in the pitcher, as Susan, slowly
                  and carefully, brings up-stairs the water we wait for. It were really a loss to
                  have the way shorter, or the servant a harum-scarum thing who would dash in with
                  her precious burden before one knew it was coming.</p>
               <p>We might try, to-day, the latest novelty in cookery, a ball of solid ice wrapped
                  in puff-paste, and baked so adroitly that the paste shall be brown while the ice
                  remains unmelted.</p>
               <p>Akin to this, is an antique achievement culinary, as old as Mrs. Glasse, at
                  least—the roasting of a pound of butter, an operation not unlike the very work we
                  are engaged in at this moment—indeed so like it, that the remembrance has occurred
                  several times. Your pound of butter is to be thoroughly crusted in bread-crumbs to
                  begin with, and then put upon the spit and turned before a very hot fire; the
                  unhappy cook standing by to dredge on crumbs continually, to prevent the slippery
                  article from running away. When the crumbs (and cook) are quite roasted, the thing
                  is done.</p>
               <p>And so should we be, but that here comes a thunder storm, fit conclusion for an
                  intense day, and very like the sudden and terrific blowings up which terminate the
                  most ferocious kind of friendships. Thick clouds, shaped like piles of cannon
                  balls, have slowly peered up from behind the horizon, and rolled themselves hither
                  and thither, spreading and gathering as they went. Now and then a thunder-whisper
                  is heard, so faint, that if we were conversing, we should not notice it; and an
                  occasional flash of lightning seems, in the sun's glare, like the waving of a
                  curtain by the fitful breeze that begins to touch the pool here and there. The
                  cloud masses gather fresh and fresh accession as they move on, like revolutionary
                  armies marching up to battle. Looking overhead, there seems a field-day in heaven;
                  great bodies of artillery in motion, forming themselves into solid phalanx, and
                  giving more and more dreadful notes of preparation. Volleys tell when divisions
                  join, and the light that announces them is as if the adamantine arch were riven,
                  disclosing dread splendors unspeakable<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6523-00000130"/>
                  Most grand, most beautiful storm! New music—that of the delicious rain, and in
                  such abundance that it washes away the very memory of the parched and burning day.
                  No wild commotion, no terror! Sublime order and an awe which is like peace. One
                  more proof of the unfailing, tender love of our heavenly Father.</p>

                  <l>With figures not severely Greek,</l>
                  <l>And drapery more or less antique;</l>
                  <l>The play, if one might call it so,</l>
                  <l>A Hebrew tale, in silent show.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>And with the throng the pageant drew</l>
                  <l>There mingled Hebrews, not a few,</l>
                  <l>Coarse, swarthy, bearded—at their side</l>
                  <l>Dark, jewelled women, orient-eyed.</l>
                  <l>If scarce a Christian hope for grace,</l>
                  <l>That crowds one in his narrow place,</l>
                  <l>What will the savage victim do,</l>
                  <l>Whose ribs are kneaded by a JEW?</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>Close on my left, a breathing form</l>
                  <l>Sat wedged against me, soft and warm;</l>
                  <l>The vulture-beaked and dark-browned face</l>
                  <l>Betrays the mould of Abraham's race;</l>
                  <l>That coal-black hair—and bistred hue—</l>
                  <l>Ah, cursed, unbelieving Jew!</l>
                  <l>I started, shuddering to the right,</l>
                  <l>And squeezed—a second Israelite!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>Then rose the nameless words that slip</l>
                  <l>From darkening soul to whitening lip.</l>
                  <l>The snaky usurer,—him that crawls,</l>
                  <l>And cheats beneath the golden balls,</l>
                  <l>The hook-nosed kite of carrion clothes—</l>
                  <l>I stabbed them deep with muttered oaths:</l>
                  <l>Spawn of the rebel wandering horde</l>
                  <l>That stoned the saints, and slew their Lord!</l>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>Up came their murderous deeds of old—</l>
                  <l>The grisly story Chaucer told,</l>
                  <l>And many an ugly tale beside,</l>
                  <l>Of children caught and crucified.</l>
                  <l>I heard the ducat-sweating thieves</l>
                  <l>Beneath the Ghetto's slouching eaves,</l>
                  <l>And thrust beyond the tented green,</l>
                  <l>The leper's cry, "Unclean, unclean!"</l>

                  <l>The show went on, but, ill at ease,</l>
                  <l>My sullen eye it could not please;</l>
                  <l>In vain the haggard outcast knelt,</l>
                  <l>The white-haired patriarch's heart to melt;</l>
                  <l>I thought of Judas and his bribe,</l>
                  <l>And steeled my soul against his tribe.</l>
                  <l>My neighbors stirred; I looked again,</l>

                  <l>A soft young cheek of olive brown,</l>

                  <l>Locks dark as midnight, that divide</l>
                  <l>And shade the neck on either side;</l>
                  <l>An eye that wears a moistened gleam,</l>
                  <l>Like starlight in a hidden stream;</l>
                  <l>So looked that other child of Shem,</l>

                  <l>Thy scutcheon spotted with the stains</l>

                  <l>And, lo! the very semblance there</l>
                  <l>The Lord of Glory deigned to wear!</l>

                  <l>The faintly-crimsoned cheek that shows</l>
                  <l>The stain of Judah's dusky rose.</l>
                  <l>Thy hands would clasp His hallowed feet</l>
                  <l>Whose brethren soil thy Christian seat;</l>
                  <l>Thy lips would press His garment's hem,</l>

                  <l>A sudden mist, a watery screen,</l>

                  <l>I strove the glistening film to stay,</l>

                  <l>The shadow floated from my soul,</l>
                  <l>And to my lips a whisper stole,</l>
