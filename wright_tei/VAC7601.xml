ere he had turned out of' sight, he cast one more glance to where she stood, and&#xD;
waving his. hand in adieu, descended the1hilly wile Rose slowly and sadly walked&#xD;
baek' to'the cottage.&#xD;
A LOVER'S QUARREL.&#xD;
I was ho ever, perfectly true that Charles had for ever and hopelessly surren"&#xD;
denied his heart to the flirting bnttbeautiful Ellen Freshville; .and it was equally&#xD;
true, that thehandsomest youth in Walton, "gentle or simple,'' had obtained a&#xD;
greater share of herheart than any other man had ever yet gained. Her father,&#xD;
a mnan of most exaggerated=ideas, dnd of shattered fortunes, comparatively speak-&#xD;
ing, was an exacting, unloving man., Frorm  a frivolous and fashionable mother&#xD;
she had received the elements.of her exquisite beauty, of her hollow and useless'&#xD;
attainments ; and a residence in the metropolis had confirmed her in that detesta-&#xD;
ble doqetry, which' is in a 'woman, what gambling or dpunkennesas-i in man-the&#xD;
sure germ of future misery. Although for the present, the seed sown by coquetry&#xD;
and flirtations do not produce at once the terrible harvest we may not unfrequently .&#xD;
see raised, still it may be counted upon with the same certainty that results follow&#xD;
certain daises; and should be t he more guarded against, that it is a vice asodious&#xD;
and hateful as it is evident and plain.&#xD;
Yet to look ilto her bright beautiful face, to gaze into her sparkling eyed, and&#xD;
dwell on het 'moist ruddy lips,-to see that wildly tossed hair, in glossy ringlets&#xD;
flying'lbneath the coquettish gipsy hat, was to see and to surrender. There was&#xD;
magic in the music of her thrilling contralto yoice. There was witchery in the&#xD;
waving -hair. To see that light form, clad in white, a blue band around her waist,&#xD;
a gauze scarf, floating fairy-like from her shoulders,"and to see ringlet and curl&#xD;
tosss 'with the' most infantinte gtace aroundwherneck, agl down her shoulders; .to&#xD;
hear 'the laugh, to catch a glimpse of the wicked eyes sparkling benetth the strw&#xD;
hat, was to'fee aifor(in that was calculated to make the most ineffaceable impres.&#xD;
sion upon a heart so inflammable as that of Charles.&#xD;
It was so vast, overwhelming, and intense;'that 'he would have been dumb in en-&#xD;
deavoring to 'describe it. Words failed to depict the fire that was. consuming his&#xD;
heart. So much the morerwas his bliss'when' she smiled, but also,'"s. much the&#xD;
greater was his agony when she frowned,' whether beauyt Was- shocking to look&#xD;
at, and every charm for a moment faded' away.&#xD;
The truth is, that Charles, who often met the dashing. beauty at church, at&#xD;
town parties (for the standing of the'Palm'ie familywas good), at;a ball occasion-&#xD;
ally, and-at a score of other places, till' lately by accident or design, had not been&#xD;
able to pluck up the courage to tell her his love. He had danced with.her, of late&#xD;
had escorted her home, and met her in her walks oftener than formerly. She com-'&#xD;
greherided all in a moment ;' and there was'that in his fair, ingenuous,, and strik-&#xD;
ingly handsome face and demeanor,that insensibly attracted her despite herself.&#xD;
Finally Charles,'through the medium of "cousin" 'Rose, had taken heart;of grace,&#xD;
anid inaking 'h  the mistress of his secret, had- thusiuformed Ellen of his love,&#xD;
till, by banter- and laugh, he laid his heart himself'at her feet, and in * a torrent of&#xD;
burning eloquence, that. startled the noyel-reading girl, struck some, sacred and&#xD;
holy'chord a moment-in her breast, and she pledged her love to him in return..&#xD;
A vivid imagination could fancy the delitvium of delight 'whichh nps~t have filled&#xD;
the feverish brain 'of' Charles as he walked' home, the accegpIted lover, on that night&#xD;
of .nights-that night marked in his' calendaLr, by a wven' a1endor of moon and&#xD;
etafs such as never before tmet-his ecstatic sight&#xD;
"I love you, death Charles ! I love!"&#xD;
&#xD;
Such were the-rapturois sounds that the air sang, as thougL every fibre was the&#xD;
chord of a harp and become vocal.&#xD;
lays passed l7y, and, they were happy, though their walks and interviews were&#xD;
few and unwitnessed,' for Ellen afteiallAhad a hesitation' in' ltting it be known&#xD;
generally that Charles had been her choice. To do this would be'"to' surrender&#xD;
every other chance of flirting; of'missing the compliments of young, "'Squire," of&#xD;
goin 4to the balls given bythe garrison of Liverpool-for her- father knew the of-&#xD;
ficers of the mess well.-and of visiting the theatre-after, of doing and'saying a thou-&#xD;
sand things, which it did not suit her temperament to surrender, so that--they had&#xD;
much bickering, many quarrels. But 'she 'had enslaved him ; she was now his ty-&#xD;
iant, and h was adaptive 'at' hetknee.&#xD;
Uridet a huge'beech, that' stood at the foot-ofr the little wooden bridge, crossing&#xD;
the brook to a greep lane, there, perfectly clear of intruders, and' about the same&#xD;
hour that Edward was holding hisifterviewwith-Rose, Charles stebd with Ellen&#xD;
by his side,.&#xD;
"'Wel," said 'the petulant beauty, ' why do you 1not speak to me ?  Have I&#xD;
taken all this troulble't6 dress=my hair in 'the -ringletW you rave-about so much, to&#xD;
have no.word ? Am IQgrown.hideout to-night ?"&#xD;
"Oh, o--Elei" e&amp;amp;replied; hrriedly; "you are only too beautiful."&#xD;
Too beautifulI" she sacl; smiling,'yet flattered. " I don't understand that.-&#xD;
'Just look me in the'fsee now,'and speak the truth without any ambiguity. ' Come,&#xD;
turn-now speak out ;" and taking him by the arm by a sort of gentle force she&#xD;
made him obey her, as if he had 'been a child.&#xD;
There was something'audacious -ii the unceremonious nature of her sway over&#xD;
him, and yet it was full of a resistless attraction. As he did look into her face,&#xD;
with its great wealth 'of beauty, his heart filled with a sense of pain ; for after all,&#xD;
with her'lightness' and -her mood like that of April weather could she really love&#xD;
him? and if not, hoW. dreadful''the deceit ! But lovely she certainly was. The&#xD;
eyes of Charles were dazzled, and again they grew dim. He smiled at first, and&#xD;
then the smile vanished. :His cheeks paled with his deep love. His lips trembled.&#xD;
sever had she rpssed other beautiful hair more attractively.&#xD;
"Why, good gracious !" she exclaimed,' " what's the matter with you, Charles?&#xD;
Are you really, going to 'cry because I look better }than usual ?"&#xD;
'No'; that wad not what would have m ade him 'cry,he thought.&#xD;
"   naery wretchedEllen,"' said he, hanging down his head.&#xD;
" Why ?" was the natural question ; and at the moment he could not help fan-&#xD;
cying she laughed at hir. "'l'&#xD;
"You are going to Liverpool to-night,".said he, "to 'a ball, given by the offi-&#xD;
:ers of the garrison, to mingle among the crowd of fashionables, in the gay, heart-&#xD;
less throng who have no feeling for others, and care not how the world goes if&#xD;
their own'selfish pleasures are not marred."&#xD;
"I am going to eijoy the music, the dance, the company," replied Ellen. " Are&#xD;
you sorry that I intend tobe pleased ?"&#xD;
" The smiles and the cot pliments of the, men !" exclaimed' Charles, bitterly.-,&#xD;
" Oh ! you should have added those. Elen, you love those praises ot' your beauty&#xD;
far:too well."&#xD;
' Heyday, sir, what is this?  And are you not going?  You have been invited,&#xD;
that I' know ; -for 'you'told me so a fortnight back."&#xD;
"I refused it," replied Charles. "Mr. Louis desired it ; but I declined it."&#xD;
" And knew that I was going, all the time," said Ellen.&#xD;
" I thought'in huad gienup' the idea," was his reply.&#xD;
"I changed my ifrnd, and youhad better do the same. Why should I not en-&#xD;
joy those pleasures that are suitable to my age, temperament, to my place and sta,&#xD;
£ion ?"&#xD;
S" Do not go, Ellen, if you love me," urged Charles, staggered at the question.&#xD;
" And why, for that very reason, should&amp;amp;I not go ?" insisted hllen.&#xD;

"Don't tell us your name, old 'Slip-the-wind,'" interrupted another, with a&#xD;
wrin. " We knows it too well: but what's to be done, bo'? If the lads get shy,&#xD;
and small blame to 'em, they can't be catched like blackbirds with salt on the&#xD;
tail."&#xD;
"Salt be hanged," returned a beter-dispositioned member of the gang. "'Who's&#xD;
to blame the poor devils?  Shiver my timbers, if I wouldn't rather be nigger-&#xD;
hunting on the Gold Coast than skulking here, and in no such good company,&#xD;
than picking mayhap, some old messmate, after giving him a wipe of a cutlass.&#xD;
It's the most onhiiman dodge, mind me, as ever was hit oti for manning the&#xD;
navy-"i&#xD;
"Do you mean me, by your good company, Jack Jigger ?' asked Slip-the-wind,&#xD;
With mock politeness ; "'cos if you does-"&#xD;
"Well, what if I does ?" growled the seaman.&#xD;
Why, that's my-answer, that's all I" and as he spoke,;the ruffian seized a'heavy&#xD;
jug and hiirled it with such fury at him, that had it :net. the other's head in all&#xD;
probability no thickness of skull could have saved itz from fracture. As it was, it&#xD;
passed him within an inch, dashed the glass bar-window into atoms, and came&#xD;
with such force against "Black Dick," the landlord (who was just then bargaining&#xD;
with another of his genus for a capture,) as to drive him, blaspheming and groan-&#xD;
ing, into a corner under his own'bar, whence he was picked up, covered with blood&#xD;
and liquor, looking a- ghastly object."&#xD;
" Curse you !" roared the fourth, who it appears .had. charge of the party;&#xD;
" can't you keep your flappers still, spilling good grog and kicking up a shindy.&#xD;
Take that,' and be d-d to you!I" and instantly, with a frightful crash, descended&#xD;
on the aggressor's head an immense bludgeon, which in turn laid Slip-the-wind,&#xD;
under the table..&#xD;
As the men in the hurry of their surprise had seized their " stretchers," it would&#xD;
not have taken much to make the fight general, but the hoarse voice of their&#xD;
leader, bidding them stop their quarrel,' brought a truce, and the next moment&#xD;
the face of Black Dick, whose head had been bound with a cloth, through which&#xD;
the blood was oozing, appeared at the door, and his voice in a hissing, half whis-&#xD;
per, attracted their attention.&#xD;
"There's a chance," said the scoundrel. " And so that's the boy that hit me a&#xD;
lick, isit ?"' he added, as he saw Slip-the-wind rn'pretty much, the. same condition&#xD;
as himself, seated on a chair, preparations of brown paper and vinegar being on&#xD;
hand; " Ah ! I'll remember the swab, I'will.'"&#xD;
'Stow all that' said the leader, "and tell us what's in the wind,"&#xD;
" Why, there's a kid just acrossing the lane by the maripe store-shop, where&#xD;
he's going in; old Carney Grogger told me of him this minute. If you watch&#xD;
him out, you can nail him; and, bo'sun, don't forget my ' tips.'"  . .&#xD;
"KBe off-be scarce, you ugly hound," replied Jack Jigger. ."You and Carney,&#xD;
who is an unhanged robber, would sell your own fathers, I believe, and-"&#xD;
"Bear a hand," interrupted the leader, authoritatively, "and 'let's have none of'&#xD;
your ' bosh,' Jack Jigger, or I'll report you whenwe gets on board ; if I don't&#xD;
-   -" and he uttered a tremendous litany of oaths. "'tCome get your tools, and un-&#xD;
der weigh, and remember he must not be missed."&#xD;
The next moment they were stealthily creeping down the dirty alley, under&#xD;
cover of the darkness, and crossing the road, erouched under the shadow of an old.&#xD;
shed opposite some small houses, on one of which the sign of the treacherous&#xD;
store-dealer surmounting a black doll, was to be seen.&#xD;
A young man, who had ,the look of an artizan, with his apron half tucked&#xD;
round his waist, by the momentary blink of the moonshine was seen to emerge&#xD;
cautiously out of, the shop, the door of which was instantly closed behind him,&#xD;
and in another instance he was surrounded y half-a-dozen men, who, with, oaths&#xD;
and menaces and flashing weapons, would have startled a man of a-far more comn-&#xD;
posed nervous system than the unfortinate rey they now made sure of.&#xD;
" Not so much noise, my chickens," said blip-the-wind, whose head, bound likle&#xD;
&#xD;
the landlord's, gave to his cadaverous and livid blood-stained face the most hcsribl~e&#xD;
appearance, as he, caught hokd of the youth's arm, he having just fellpd:one ina,&#xD;
by aClever' blow, to the ground, and, with, a c1ry that' roseto a shriek, the' streets&#xD;
risounded to-.&#xD;
[ "Ielpi..murder-I help! The press-gang.  Help, for the love of God!"&#xD;
For- an instant there ran, like fire in a powder magazine, like the vision of sud-&#xD;
den death from, a pistol-shot or mortal stab, a thrill of horror through 'his whole&#xD;
being.&#xD;
Seh .a; terrible :cry, was not likely to raise any in -his defence, while'the an-&#xD;
moungement. of the press-gang would only have a tendency to hurry avay those&#xD;
already flying to his aid, as the first words rose' shrilly on the night air.&#xD;
rNeyertheless t did 'attract one to his side, who, to say the truth, had better&#xD;
have been a hundred miles, away, and he had already mingled in the melee before&#xD;
a sense;pf his frightful danger dawned upon' him.&#xD;
Edward had arrived in town, and either ignorant, or'presuming upon his imden-&#xD;
tures (as apprentice to his father, for the law had, a clause, oftener neglected.than&#xD;
heeded, i favor of the approutice), had traversed Dale Street, Water Street, and&#xD;
the Goree, in order to make across the .most dangerous, locality in Liverp6ol, at&#xD;
the time, towards Treatham, bordering the river, where several 'houses, (timber&#xD;
yards, and shipwright's workshops stood, and among which Mr. Louis dwelt.&#xD;
He was already stumbling on the gang, when the awful cry startled him, and in&#xD;
its agony woke all his sympathies.&#xD;
Thenext moment he was among them. The strife was determined and furious,&#xD;
but ;birefand;bloody! ;Senseless, and severely wounded, both the young men were&#xD;
dragged into a boat that lay in a neighboring basin, which put off at once into&#xD;
the river.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE BROTHER'S PRESS       ENTIMENT.&#xD;
"WHAT'O the matter, Charles?" asked IRose,,the next morning, as they met be-&#xD;
low. "You look ill, and worn. I hope that nothing has occurred between you&#xD;
and Ellen?""-&#xD;
" No-no," he replied: "nothing of consequence-t4iat's not it," and the poor&#xD;
lad drew his-hand across his pallid- brow. "It's far other than that."&#xD;
" What then, Charles, is it?--for thelove of'heaven; tell me," she exclaimed in&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
Something has happened to Edward. I know it. It was told to melast night&#xD;
as I was going to bed," said he in a decided tone.&#xD;
"Told you-told you, last night!. ;Something' happened to Edward !' and she,&#xD;
too, turned deadly pale, as she remembered what had struck her, as her lover left&#xD;
her, with a smile on his lips, and a promise to be back next day.&#xD;
' 'I Don't youknow that we are twins,?" said. Charles, with a gielanciolly smile.&#xD;
"It isno less strange than true thatwe,have both of us had a presentinent of any&#xD;
ill happening to the other, and that has, occurred from boyhood, w'en we were&#xD;
separated by school, or anything else.: This 'i so infallible that I never mistake it.&#xD;
I tell you, Rose, that some danger has occurred to him."&#xD;
Rosesank fainting on., chair, just as Martin Palmer came in to breakfast, and&#xD;
his wife entered from her bedroom,&#xD;
A5 Why, Charley, ladi" said the old man, " what the deuce ails you, that you look&#xD;
so whiter and scared'?"&#xD;
: -" And here's Rose," exclaimed nTrs. Palmer: "sh is faig. Do go, Martin,&#xD;
ar-d get her a cup of cold water.&#xD;

rents would thus be rendered. The thought was almost impiety.&#xD;
He was startled by a light footstep late in the afternoon while alone in the shop,&#xD;
leaning moodily against the work-bench. Little had been' done that day. He&#xD;
lifted up his eyes, and saw that it was Rose. Apprehension and fear were written&#xD;
on her face, but he had no consolatgioni.toloffer, her, and he stood gazing upon&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Oh, Charles," she said, ",speak to me, say. something to relieve me of my&#xD;
dreadful terrors. Your poor hiothr 'has actuallyy sobbed herself to sleep. Your&#xD;
father has, Rot yet returned, and I cannot bear my own thoughts or company. You&#xD;

CHAPTER V.'&#xD;
THE   E NLIST MENT. .&#xD;
IT was a lovely afternoon, and the populous village of Kirkdale was fnl of bustle&#xD;
and merry-making, for drums and fifes were in the street. The recruiting-sergeant&#xD;
was at..work; beer was fdwing, the whole place had the semblance of a fair ; and&#xD;
men, women, and children were out- adding to the vivacity of'the scene, though&#xD;
groups of tipsy laborers, here and 'there, -with the, fatal butsch of 'ribbons in theii-&#xD;
caps, showed the thoughtless creatures had been caught-s me under the pressure&#xD;
of evil times, some from the result of intoxication, the ser eant's oily tongue and&#xD;
mendacious promises ; and others, through a 'propensity for ;what seemed a life of&#xD;
- glitter and false glory. There were women too, with pale, sad faces, to be seen&#xD;
gazing with alarm and apprehension, on some men here and there-husbands-&#xD;
brothers-sons-that either had or were likely to be induced to "follow the drum;"&#xD;
and the tale of wretchedness, broken homes, and heart-br ak, 'were'to be' read so&#xD;
legibly on the tearful countenances of others, that Charles, as i walked among&#xD;
the, crowd, needed no dictionary to'translate the agony but too palpable.&#xD;
It was, in' fact, a country fair-day, 'and the sergeant--Sergeant'-1jtely, by your&#xD;
leave; of the Royal Kensington Grenadiers,. to give himhis full title, without any&#xD;
invidious distinctions-had been so well aware of this, that  plans were .so&#xD;
inwoven with the business of the fair, as to have monopolized no small share, of the&#xD;
interest the day created.&#xD;
With the keenest of eyes the wily sergeant Went to and fro, as restlessly as'Satan&#xD;
wanders about "like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour."  It was his&#xD;
eye that- beheld Hodge Naylor having a' "tiff " with his pretty sweet-heart, Bally&#xD;
Brown, and followed up the' black advantage of 'the moment so well, that the&#xD;
shilling, the beer, and the cockade had been accepted by the smartingountryman&#xD;
ere he had time tq cool his rage, or Sally time to withdraw him from the recruiting&#xD;
officer's clutches.&#xD;
It was Sergeant Kitely that overheard "Missis" Clatter belaboring her half&#xD;
tipsy husband with her tongue so mightily, that there was litle difficulty in making&#xD;
himself master of. the carcass, of " jolly" Dlick Clatter, bricklayer ("ljolly," s his&#xD;
comradJes in~ their' ups called him ;) fo that while sally 'Brown would hae No ery&#xD;
ber eyes out, and seek for another lover whichi doubtless she did,) " Missis"' Olatter,&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
with her heart wrung and her spirit broken, must'fain betake.her to the workhouse&#xD;
with her two young children, .the one to become a mendicant, the children n&#xD;
process of time t; sgi1 the ranks of crime, which -in those ' glorious tines of the&#xD;
war" annually drew its contribution from the helpless infancy and the plastic&#xD;
childhood that was left to want and wretchedness,,having no ':other means of ex-&#xD;
istence in the arid' world before them. Oh, the sergeant was a clever tactician,&#xD;
and prided hip self on his skill in livingg" the silly birds with his "chaff," as he&#xD;
honestly admitted it -to he..&#xD;
It was Sergeant Kitely-he, and none other,-that stood by the window of'Dame&#xD;
Morris's cottage, and overheard the poor weeping mother pray to God for her son,&#xD;
that he would eschew strong, rink and repent ; pray-for she was a widow, and&#xD;
Robert a fair'young lad barely twenty, who sat dreamily in a chair, after.an orgie&#xD;
the previous night with several " gay" young men, who had a desire to be thought&#xD;
fine, dashing, "live-har4" fellows-she, I say, was a widow; and.he was the oldest&#xD;
child of' her love, the support of three young children,:and her only hope in life--&#xD;
pray mightily, and then fling herself in an agony of sorrow at the lad'A feet,&#xD;
beseeching hi to be warned; in time,;and to repent of his courses ; to which,&#xD;
though he felt a pang for it, the youth--who would not "be: a "spooney',a "milk-&#xD;
sop,".tied to an old woman's' apron-strings for the world-turned a dea fear with a&#xD;
laugh.&#xD;
It was Sergeant Iitely that-heard and witnessed this, who said to himself with&#xD;
a elnugkle, ",Aha! my lad, you'll be mine before night." And so he was.&#xD;
.Towardsthe afternoon, Charles had arrived-in front. of some: booths pleasantly&#xD;
shaded by trees, through which peeped the gray tower and spire of; the church;&#xD;
and at a little. distance off ,Charles. stood aloof, and' with a keen glance surveyed&#xD;
the whole,.taking every incident, as it . occurred at a glance, and his heart ached&#xD;
none. the less for what he thus mastered.&#xD;
In front of a crowded booth, in which-crowds were dancing, singing, and drink-&#xD;
ing, while the bustle, noise, and confusion of the fair rose in discordant echoes&#xD;
around him, were placed a number of benches, on which several farmers'&#xD;
lads, and laboring and working men set, while a gaily dressed brother sergeant-&#xD;
the joyial dog, who sang such funny songs-martial,:humorous, bacchanalian, and&#xD;
anacreontic--was at the moment- treating them to a celebrated, chorus, beginning&#xD;
with "Why; soldiers, why ?", and so on, to, which the gaping crowd listened with&#xD;
raptures, and in honor of which they drank their ale, and clattered their drinking&#xD;
vessels, as if they werpabout to charge the enemy, or had just returned victorious&#xD;
out of some tremendous battle.&#xD;
Beside thsseforms;stood a youth (Dame Morris's son,) whose flushed cheeks and&#xD;
dreamy eyes expressed the result of potations taken probably to drown the.memgry&#xD;
of his, mother's prayers and remonstrances,-his elder sister's tears, or the lisping&#xD;
intercession of his younger brothers, and so had rushed out for excitement,&#xD;
Hefound it, sure enough. He was reeling- up towards thebooth in question&#xD;
(Charles was watching him,) and, as two or three who knew him hailed him with&#xD;
a' tipsy welcome, the glittering eyes of the sergeant' fell upon him, and he in-&#xD;
stinctively knew that this was his, moment,. In the; morning the infatuated Robert&#xD;
might' repent, and even. bid the;dashing Sergeant Kitely "go to there devil ;" but&#xD;
if he (Sergeant Kitely) missed him now, he muttered, " he would forgive him," and&#xD;
the morning would come too late.&#xD;
here's a ay, smart, well-built fellow, now, who would make tone of the smartest&#xD;
soldiers in hi Majesty's arumy, God bless him !"-,here the sergeant "saluted''-,&#xD;
".with clean limbs, a quick eye, and a form as straight as a May-pole. ,I'll warrant&#xD;
him an. o cer's commission in a. month., Glad to: see you, my lad.;". and the cordial&#xD;
sergeant held out his hand to him, which was taken.&#xD;
" Thaukee-thankee," stammered Robert; "but I don't mean to 'list this time;&#xD;
I ain't going to be an officer yet-haw, haw    'ad"         .ck    t&#xD;

- "And what'll they do at home ?", asked Robert, gravely&#xD;
' Confound the clown "  muttered the sergeant.  "What the devil does it&#xD;
signify to me? Do at home ?" 'he 'loudly":said. "Why, live nobly on, the fine&#xD;
plunder you'll be able to-send them from Spanish cities."'&#xD;
"Ah! it's a long way to gd for it,""tbrted Robert.'-&#xD;
"' Think -of the pretty girls-when quartered in a country town-think of the&#xD;

soldier-erimp's-general beverage--" and wishing his Majesty had a thousand more&#xD;
fellows like you to serve him. Drink !"&#xD;
"Thank you kindly," and Robert drank deeply. "Here's wishing the same."&#xD;
Just -then; a sturdy. little boy ran up between the sergeant and hisintended&#xD;
victim,.and clasping Robert round the knee, the curly pate, whimpering, said,&#xD;
"Bobby, do'ee come home, cousin. Jane sent me to say as mammy be crying-&#xD;
do'ee come-"&#xD;
" Cousin Jane's a fool," was the reply ; but he, bitterly, regretted the words the&#xD;
moment they were spoken.&#xD;
"So your mother makes a pet of you,,does she ?" said the sergeant,; with a grin.&#xD;
"And a pretty. cousin I suppose sends to look after you, eh? Ali! well, it's a&#xD;
pity."&#xD;
"What's a pity ?" demanded Robert, furiously, and ashamed. of himself.&#xD;
"Why, that you are not more of a man," was the, dry response.&#xD;
The sympathy which Charles felt this momenton behalf of the poor dupe was&#xD;
almost irresistible, and he pushed his way through the crowd towards them, as&#xD;
Robert disengaged the boy from his knee,;and, with aninsulted dignity-that would&#xD;
have been comical but for the tragic result that lay couched beneath, drew himself&#xD;
a step or two back, scowling on the speaker.-&#xD;
" I am man enoughfor you," retorted the flushed and angry youth, " and good;&#xD;
enoug-h to make a soldier-aye,,;or an officer-"&#xD;
" 4Thy, so I said," insisted the sergeant. "'Do you say-done ?"&#xD;
" I say ' done !' " shouted Robert ; and his palm fell. with a smack on Kitel 's.&#xD;
Charles stepped forward. ;"Don't take it," said he to Robert. " Wait till the&#xD;
morrow, and think of it-better."&#xD;
It was too late. The ,man who hesitates is lost. As Robert, struck with the&#xD;
words, was a moment'mute, the shilling was in hishand, the colors fastened in his&#xD;
cap, the drum set up its noisy roll, and the fifes were triumphant in the "Con-&#xD;
querig hero comes ;" and Dame Morris was robbed of her son.&#xD;
" The devil take your soul," said the sergeant, turning -a face upon Charles full&#xD;
of the most malignant and. diabolical hatred. " If I don't have you in my clutches&#xD;
before very long, my name's not Sergeant Kitely ; and so look out, my boy."&#xD;
But Charles had not heard the words. He walked away hurriedly homewards,&#xD;
pondering deeply, as well as 'other thoughts would. permit him, on what he had&#xD;
seen, at the same time that Robert was hurried away to take the necessary oath.&#xD;
CHAPTER VL&#xD;
ILL' NEWS...&#xD;
IT was with no lighter heart that Charles turned himself homeward th w&#xD;
he started forth. . He had not seen in his walk anything that was cale&#xD;
renew the brightness which had begun to fade away so blackly, and theshadows&#xD;
deepened on his soul, as the still and, purple evening succeeded the flaming gold of&#xD;
the setting sun. . The noise and the murmurs of the crowds he had quitted 'died&#xD;
away, and the familiar trees and church-tower of his own pretty village met his&#xD;
look without infusing into him the slightest sentiment of cheerfulness. Hisheart&#xD;
beat fast as he approached the.pleasant, lane where ithad so often bounded at the&#xD;
sight of Ellen in her snowy frock, with her, exquisite face lighting upwith joy at&#xD;
his approach.. All was sombre now, and he rned sharply away without having his&#xD;
old tenderness turned into emotion by a glimpse of her. She was not there. She had&#xD;
not returned probably from her gay Liverpool friends. She was possibly the life&#xD;
and soul of a happy group at the present moment, and. thought, very likely, as~it,&#xD;

tie -of him who had been her adorer as though he had never existed for her. It Is&#xD;
not an easy task for a man to surrender up at once every tie that has become to&#xD;
him a portion of-his existence, and Charles was no exception to the rule. But he&#xD;
would never kneel at her feet more. lie would never sue for a love that was like&#xD;
water-light as air-unsubstantial as the morning mist, and vainer than the&#xD;
shadows of a dream.&#xD;
Yet how beautiful she was?  Vividly, life-like she started up before him, her&#xD;
dress transparent in the purple twilight, and her eyes like radiant stars bending so&#xD;
fondly their glances upon his own.. Much reading of heroic poesy, and the old lore&#xD;
that has made love an immortal theme with the poet and th e romancist, had cast&#xD;
him for a long time into a world far other than the world of work in which he&#xD;
daily and honorably toiled. His visions were such as vista a poet in his sleep.&#xD;
Sounds came in his dream like the melodies of  lolian hars-like those miracu-&#xD;
lous sonnatas that the great.composers had written when awaken from a dream of&#xD;
Paradise. Pictures such as artists, now immortal, have c nceived -spread them-&#xD;
selves before him, and he was suddenly and rudely awaken from his life-dream--&#xD;
neither poet, musician, nor artis, even in f1icy, but an humble worker -a man of&#xD;
intense feeling, whose heart had been shamefully scorned, and who no longer be-&#xD;
lieved in the existence, far less the power, of love. His heart at least acknowl-&#xD;
edged its sway no more. Ashes alone were left of its past fires.&#xD;
It is quite possible, after all, that Charles, to a certain extent, exaggerated the&#xD;
nature of the outrage (for he would look on it in that light) which Ellen had been&#xD;
guilty of towards him, because she refused-and laughed at his objections while she&#xD;
did so-to abstain from going to what, next to a handsome beau, most pleased her,&#xD;
a ball. He made no allowance for the long course of habt which had familiariz-&#xD;
ed her with such things. He did not think whether he ha not been as unreasona-&#xD;
ble as he felt sure she herself was. Lovers generally do think each other in the&#xD;
wrong, and themselves in the right ; under the circumstances, hence arise bicker-&#xD;
ings, quarrels, self-tortures, separations, and much self-infflicted misery ; for of all the&#xD;
egotistical sentiments which affect man or woman, none is greater than that arising&#xD;
from the passion of love. What faults they can see in others, yet own to none&#xD;
themselves ! How pitiless they are to the offender, how f411 of tenderness for their&#xD;
own feelings ! Alas ! they are very often egregiously in eiror.&#xD;
With dark and bitter feelings, Charles therefore pulled his hat over his brows&#xD;
as he passed the old frequented spot, and went on homewards, unseen, as he thought.&#xD;
But it was not so. Under the spreading branches of a great beech stood Ellen,&#xD;
gazing after him ; and as she saw, that he averted his face from the once beloved&#xD;
spot, and saw the shadow on his handsome-countenance, tpe idea of losing him for&#xD;
ever struck her heart like an ice-bolt. She did not know till then what a hold he had&#xD;
got of her affections, and unconsciously she wrung her hands!together in the bitterness&#xD;
of her anguish, like one that mourns the deepest loss a h man being can sustain&#xD;
At this moment, had he known it, Charles would have felt himself fully avenged.&#xD;
It was with a slow step, a tearful eye, with her bright face all clouded with&#xD;
sorrow, that she in turn walked homeward ; for she had returned from Liverpool&#xD;
ere the noon, and made sure-that he would be there to r ieet her to "make it up",&#xD;
with her, and to part from her in the evening with a fond kiss of love---and this&#xD;
was the wretched result. She retired to her chamber, add would have wept ; but&#xD;
her pride came to her aid, and repressed her tears. He could not love her so&#xD;
much, she thought, or he would not have been angry at such a trifle. " But per-&#xD;
haps," whispered hope, " to-morrow evening he will come;" And then she smiled&#xD;
again, and felt glad as she looked'on her beautiful face in the glass.&#xD;
Charles meanwhile arrived at home, and found his mother sad and mournful enough,&#xD;
listening vaguely to the consolations which Rose was eadeavoring to force into&#xD;
her beliefs She started and uttered an exclamation of joy when Charles entered.&#xD;
He' embraced her tenderly, and as he received, in anwrt  his query, the infor-&#xD;
mation that his father had not yet returned, his apprehe siops became awakened ;&#xD;
but he had received no repetition of his presentiment. No fai-ther harm as yet had&#xD;

happened to his brother.; but the yearning that he felt to he near him rose into an&#xD;
impatient agony.&#xD;
he evening wore on, and while they waited in.monotonous silence for old Mar-&#xD;
.tin's return, his well-known footsteps struck upon the ear. Rose sprang to the&#xD;
door, and he entered it-alone!&#xD;
" Edward !--Oh, where is Edward, Martin ?" asked his wife.&#xD;
The weary old man shook his head, as he took his accustomed chair, and wiped&#xD;
his face and eyes with his pocket-handkerchief. "I don't know much more than I&#xD;
did," said he, "and he must certainly be on board the ' tender;' but I could -not&#xD;
get any boat to go with me along side-the boatmen were all too much&#xD;
alarmed."&#xD;
" And have you no news at all for us, dear uncle ?" asked Rose.&#xD;
"Yes, father," said Charles, "'tell us what you have done, have heard, have&#xD;
seen. Tell us that, andlet us see what must be done.&#xD;
"Speak, Martin, dear," said Mrs. Palmer, "have you any news, in God's&#xD;
name?"&#xD;
"A little,-and better news than I thought," said old Martin, again wiping his&#xD;
eyes. " On inquiring, I found that Edward had not got to Mr. Louis's house or&#xD;
he would have been safe ; and I was told that cries for help had been heard in the&#xD;
night, and that the press-gang had carried off some persons. Edward must have&#xD;
been, one of them.o.&#xD;
b1 Yes, Martin--yes," broke in his wife. " But go on-tell me the little that is&#xD;
good, for this is bad enough."&#xD;
" Well," continued Martin, while Charles listened most intently, "I went with&#xD;
him to the magistrates, and told him my case, and that he was my    ren-&#xD;
tice----                                                          p&#xD;
"Yes-_yes, father, I understand that," urged Charles, hastily ; "and what said&#xD;
the magistrates to you then ?"&#xD;
"They told me that as I had two sons, I might spare one for my country," re-&#xD;
turned Martin, despairingly.&#xD;
" Cant!" cried Charles with scorn; " the cant of patriots that are paid for&#xD;
maintaining what is -termed the 'government.' Well, father, for all that, there&#xD;
was the law in your favor, if there be law at all. What did they say to&#xD;
that ?"                              S.&#xD;
" I said 'so, too," Martin went on, " and insisted upon that point. They seem-&#xD;
ed struck with that view, and I was told that inquiries would be made, and I add-&#xD;
ed that I would pay for his release, if they would be moderate with a man&#xD;
'who had lost one of his best workmen, and the means of his small prosper-&#xD;
ity-P- P&#xD;
"Well-well," said Charles, impatiently ; " pray-pray go on ?"&#xD;
"Well, that-that was all ;" and Martin Palmer bent his face in his hands and&#xD;
sobbed, murmuring, " My boy, my boy ! where are you'?"&#xD;
"4Think, dear father," urged Charles, "is there no more ?"&#xD;
" I forgot to gay," returned Martin, lifting up his face more cheerfully for '&#xD;
moment, " that Mr. Louis, who is influential there, told me he would not, let the&#xD;
matter rest, and see that everything was done that could be done ; but, oh I there-&#xD;
.is no hope--there is no hope."&#xD;
"I think there is a little still," Rose quietly said, during a pause;- - " what we&#xD;
must now do is to know as much as we possibly can of him, which will guide ia&#xD;
the better what to do."&#xD;
-  "Excellent, Rose!" exclaimed Charles; "you are right--you are always in the&#xD;
,right,! Would that more resembled you I" and there was a constrained bitterness&#xD;
in his tone at the last, words.&#xD;
- .ose blushed, but continued, though she knew what his meaning was.  'The&#xD;
next is to submit to what we neither foresaw and could not avoid with the, best&#xD;
;rignation, and pray that heaven will protect him."&#xD;
" Yes, Rose, my child," said the mother, " that we will do with all our hearts.&#xD;

soul."&#xD;
"'And I think I have a plan,'l began Rose once more.&#xD;
"A plan !" exclaimed Charles ." let us hear it ; that is j ast what I want to hit&#xD;
upon myself, and cannot."                    '  .     s&#xD;
"Nor can you do anything in it, Charles," returned Rose, very tranquilly, "ex-&#xD;
cept remain at home in quiet, and comfort your parents,-and be as patient as Jos-&#xD;
' Yes-yes, it is easy to say patience," cried the impatient youth ; "but if you&#xD;
knew how intense my dread-my--But why should I do you the injustice of&#xD;
thinking your anxiety less than my own. Pardon me, Rose, and let us hear of&#xD;
your plan."&#xD;
"It is to go myself, said Rose.                    t&#xD;
"Yourself! Go where ?" was the general question.&#xD;
"iTo Liverpool-to the tender, which you shall tell me allabout."&#xD;
"You are mad," began old Martin; "you are mad, girl. Why, I&#xD;
" They do not press women," said' Rose, smiling. "I will find the means.--&#xD;
There's a way to every will; and if you can trust  to me, I will bring you back&#xD;
news'ofEdward, without running any danger that a se man's wife does not&#xD;
run.''&#xD;
"Well, I am not afraid of you, .my girl,", said Martin comnmendigly-; "and-If&#xD;
-a little money can get you a boat to go alongside the tender,' you shall have it. I11&#xD;
write a letter for you to take to Mr. Louis, and if he does! not go with you, 'he&#xD;
will, perhaps, put you in the way to do so. 'As for me, he insisted that I should&#xD;
return home as soon as possible, and, beg of you,. Charles.not- to go too near&#xD;
the town. It is dangerous now, for the ' press' is hot, and en are scarce."&#xD;
Sd it was agreed that Rose should go ; and, that night .hey retired to rest a&#xD;
little relieved after Rose and Charles had held a long and uninterrupted conversation&#xD;
-together.&#xD;
CHAPTER         VI I.,&#xD;
THE TNDER.&#xD;
TuE tender, which was in effect one prominent feature of the system  of&#xD;
"pressing," or kidnapping men for the navy, is certainly th# very antithesis of its&#xD;
name, and signifies only some old useless hulk or other, 'storm or battle-beaten,&#xD;
'which'tended or waited' on the wants of a war-ship in the matters of men, stores,&#xD;
&amp;amp;c., as necessity dictated.&#xD;
It was into the low and foul forecastle of the tender that' Edward;and his com-&#xD;
'panion, 'still bleeding and faint, were driven 'after the boat come alongside, and its&#xD;
prey dragged rather than lifted 'out.. The' siekeing smell; =and the close atmosphere&#xD;
of the place, -brought on the-faintness which the air of tie river had begun to&#xD;
dissipate in a slight degree. With about as little tendernes as slavers show when&#xD;
stowing their 'holds, the two were brutally bundled' below, to die if they liked, or&#xD;
to find awhat accommodation and rest, if rest was4to be hal, they could. A dirty&#xD;
piece of sail-cloth, or some such matter, was also handed them, which some, more&#xD;
compassionatee than the rest; bound round their heads,:for, after all, dead men would&#xD;
have been useless'; and for the raging tirst which soon 'ban to affect them; a&#xD;
pitcher of water, whose nature the imagination was 'happil = ignorant of, had been&#xD;
.left and herded there with'a dozen others , they were left i 1 the darkness to brood&#xD;
'upon their' fate.                             - ''&#xD;
Their thoughts were dismal enough. .I2dWard was ahrqost xiiad with veratin&#xD;
and~a'larm, for, from' what he 'had heard, and' now knew, his release was one oftthe&#xD;
&#xD;
TH E TWIN. BRO rHERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
21&#xD;
&#xD;
most hopeless matters under the sun. No entreaties, no prayers, no influence that&#xD;
he could command (even if ;he. could command any,) would avail him, and he could&#xD;
only think of the anguish and terror of his.loving Rose,-his brother's pain,-his&#xD;
parent's grief,-his happy, hopeful prospects for ever destroyed and gone, as if with&#xD;
the last winter's snows.&#xD;
With throbbiiig head and aching heart, amid the curses of some,.the wailing of&#xD;
others, and the desperation of some one or two, who had less to lose in the world&#xD;
than he, did Edward fall into fitful dozes of sleep till the morning came, when the&#xD;
surgeon was-to come on board and examine them, in order to draft them  off to&#xD;
H. M. gun-brig the Harpy (excellently named carrier of a crew to slaughter,)&#xD;
whose compliment of men had been much lessened by demands made upon her in&#xD;
turn, and a "brush" or two that she had been engaged in, with the enemy in the&#xD;
Channel. - Edward would have given something to have been crippled in any way,&#xD;
as this would at once have insured his release, but he was far too likely a man to&#xD;
suit ;. and when with the rest he went on deck at the hoarse. summons of the&#xD;
boatswain, it was-as.men go to the scaffold or.,the hulks, without .a fragment of&#xD;
hope that anything would step in between him and his fate.&#xD;
The scene on the deck was sufficiently striking to catch his attention, and his&#xD;
wounds, though painful, were neither dangerous, nor would his condition permit&#xD;
him to think on that subject. On the one side lay the beautiful Cheshire coast&#xD;
reposing in the broad sunshine ; on the other was stretched the splendid town of&#xD;
Liverpool. A little distance off in the river was anchored a taut and trim-built&#xD;
gun-brig, whose exquisite proportions caught the eye in 'a moment, and he was&#xD;
thinking of liberty and home, when a rude and sudden thrust drove his thoughts&#xD;
away, and sent him almost on his face on the dirty deck of the tender.&#xD;
"This here young fellow,". said the leader of the ipress-gang, "run his head into&#xD;
the noose, to cut this here other captive out," pointing to the man Edward had&#xD;
hastened to assist, " and.fought like-a devil, your honor."&#xD;
"So much the better," was the officer's comment; "he'll do good service for the&#xD;
King, I hope."&#xD;
"Come, my man,t strip,".began the surgeon, coolly,&#xD;
Resistance was s9 hopeless, the chances of escape so utterly against him, that&#xD;
he could only calculate upon what the future might do in his favor ; besides that&#xD;
there were plenty around him to drag his clothes off his -back. He took off his&#xD;
coat and shirt, and the surgeon with a critical eye proceeded to examine the fine&#xD;
form before him.&#xD;
"What a magnificent deltoid," said he, in the tone of a connoisseur,. pointing to&#xD;
the development of Edward's shoulders and muscles. " Its quite a picture, on my,&#xD;
word.'&#xD;
"You'd ha' said that, your honor, if you'd seen the way in which he floored a&#xD;
couple of"our chaps : they went down like a brace of sixty-fours."  And the man&#xD;
laughed, as though he rather liked the -display Edward had made.&#xD;
." He'll do," said the surgeon ; " pass over ;" and he pointed to a group that had&#xD;
already gone from under his hands; 'and Edward without ,a word picked up .his&#xD;
jacket, and obeyed.' Within another hour he had mounted the side of the gun-&#xD;
brig, and was rated on her books as a landsman, who was to be drilled into the&#xD;
duties of a seaman with all possible speed. His wounds were dressed, his clothes&#xD;
changed ; and he wore the canvass trousers, the striped frock, and the round jacket&#xD;
of a man-of-war's-men, before noon of the third day of his better experience had&#xD;
expired.&#xD;
The real hardships of his new life, physically speaking, now commenced in&#xD;
earnest. He had'to be taught the whole 'technology of the seamen's art; how to&#xD;
hand, reef, and steer ; and his teachers were not the most polite and delicate that&#xD;
he , had come near inc his life. If anything, they were a leetle too strong in the&#xD;
richness of their vocabulary,-the high relish of their oaths, the earnest physique&#xD;
with which they enforced orders or' directions with a piece of " twice-laid." But&#xD;
they were not devils utterly : seamen are rdeither cruel nor unkind to each other,&#xD;

&#xD;
There are more of the active sympathies of humanity ,wake in their breasts,&#xD;
perhaps, than exist in any others ass; and their rude tenderness, grotesque but&#xD;
rofuse generosity, and reckless bravery, are become proverbial matters. The&#xD;
lonely and perilous life. of the ocean, which puts a number of men together for a&#xD;
length of time, has a tendency to consolidate friendships ; and they thus know how&#xD;
to appreciate.the companionship-in which they are thrown..&#xD;
With the philosophy of a man who was determined to make the best that he&#xD;
could of the worst condition he can be placed in, Edward resolved to adapt himself&#xD;
to circumstances, and see if he could not draw some honey out of the sting. He&#xD;
was admirably calculated by his frank and winning manners to make friends, and&#xD;
an hour had not passed ere he was on excellent terms with his messmates. Among&#xD;
them was one Jack Pipes, a thorough sailor, who had beep rocked in the cradle&#xD;
of the deep" from a very "babby," as he phrased it.&#xD;
Jack soon mastered the secret of Edward's grief, and sincerely sympathized with&#xD;
him ; and in order to dissipate it, he took him about the vessel through.every part&#xD;
that he could, explaining and informing him of the names and uses of all that he&#xD;
saw. There was a novelty about this which pleased Edward, and the desire for&#xD;
information being strong within him, he forced himself to take an interest, as much&#xD;
as he possibly could, in matters nautical ; and found in the grizzled old seaman,&#xD;
who thus became in a manner his tutor, the utmost facilities--for Pipes had a&#xD;
thorough sailor's love for the ocean, and believed that a vessel of war was the&#xD;
essence and ideal of mechanical beauty.,&#xD;
Certainly there are few things more beautiful as works of art, and few things&#xD;
more perfect specimens of order and arrangement, than a battle ship, be she large&#xD;
or small, a twelve or fourteen-gun brig, or a royal three-decker, with a triple row&#xD;
of cannon-a battery that is often more formidable than the stoutest ashlar fortress,&#xD;
and which, having dealt death and destruction in one place, is borne away with&#xD;
ease to another : and there reigned on the snow-white decks of the Harpy a system&#xD;
of order that contrasted most agreeably with the hideous and repulsive aspect of&#xD;
the tender.      .&#xD;
A group of men assembled in the forecastle in the afternoon drew Edward near&#xD;
to them ; and he found that they were watching the coming up the river of a fleet&#xD;
of merchantmen,.whose stately appearance, with the swelling sails stretching from&#xD;
the decks to the mast-heads, and extending, far on either side, struck him with&#xD;
admiration. The transition in the conversation, which left matters of immediate&#xD;
moment to those more foreign, was speedily made in favor of those ships ; and&#xD;
Livespool, her marts, ships, and commerce became the staple of an interesting con-&#xD;
versation.*&#xD;
" How those heavy old tubs roll about," observed a sailor. "One would think&#xD;
the frigate in convoy would have to race round -'em and whip 'em up, or they'd&#xD;
drop into Johnny Crapaud's mouth without the asking."&#xD;
" A fiddle-head and a round starn," added another. " What can you expect&#xD;
from these merchan'-men-  -"&#xD;
" Steady there, my lad ! steady !" sung out Jack Pipes, eyeing the last speaker&#xD;
with a sardonic grin. "-Who talks about craft as he has never seen ? Some lubber&#xD;
that's only known a collier-brig boxing about between the Tyne and the Thames,&#xD;
and looks on a long-boat as a young boy, tha'll grow in time. There are as noble&#xD;
ships, and as daring mariners, sent from that port, my lads," he added, with much&#xD;
emphasis, " as ever swam the seas, or trod a deck ; and I myself remember one&#xD;
who got the name of the 'Ocean Racer,' because he used to handle his craft in all&#xD;
weathers-blow high, blow low--just like a 'Flying Dutchman'--"&#xD;
"And was you on board as her mate ?" asked a sailor, with a quid in his cheek&#xD;
about the size of a small paving stone, and with a " tail" that could have felled an&#xD;
ox, if it could have been unshipped from the back of his head, lashed as it was&#xD;
with oakum and black ribbon.&#xD;
"Aye, that I was," replied Jack, " and Icould tell you a yarn of her sail ng-"&#xD;
-" A yarn ' a yarn I" exclaimed several voices, delightedly ; " side out fra bend&#xD;
&#xD;
boys, and pay away, Jack Pipes, good luck to you." Instantly Tom took his seat&#xD;
at the foot of the bowsprit, and while the shadows of the awning sheltered them&#xD;
from, the noon-day sun, the men clustered eagerly round him ; and Tom, without&#xD;
preface or apology began his story, which we shall endeavor to do as much justice&#xD;
to as lies in our power. Casting- one eye gravely along the deck to where the&#xD;
officers were parading the after.part of the brig, and clearing his throat with a&#xD;
tremendous hem ! preparatory to the introduction of a startling cube of cavendish&#xD;
tobacco, in order to lubricate his mouth, and combine enjoyment'with information,&#xD;
Tom Pipes began his yarn, to which we will devote another chapter.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
T HE YARN OF THE LIVERPOOL ,SKIPPER.&#xD;
"You see shipmates, when I was a manakin, something bigger than a quart-&#xD;
pot, I had already smelt salt water, and the waves of the sea had been blowing&#xD;
over ny cradle before I was rated as a powder-monkey on board a letter-of-marque,&#xD;
though that's neither here nor there. ?The Tobins were then among the greatest&#xD;
ship owners in Liverpool, and dealt in black contraband-that's Guinea-birds, my&#xD;
lads, niggers black for the plantations, palm oil, ivory, and gold-dust,o-and one of&#xD;
the crack craft that they wasp most proud of answered to the hail of the ' John&#xD;
Tobin,' and was commanded by Captain Jack Deadeye, who feared neither man nor&#xD;
devil, and loved a gale of wind better than a capful, if he could only run before&#xD;
it, and a stiff nor'-wester better nor a calm. Lord! how I have heard him rap&#xD;
out when we did get into them still latitudes, and sitting on the taffrail whistling&#xD;
for the breeze ; and when it came, and freshened up, and began to sing, how he&#xD;
would rub his hands, and crack on canvass, sail after sail, to the very trucks, till&#xD;
the mast bent like whips, and the craft went over the sea, fairly leaping out like a&#xD;
young dolphin   "&#xD;
" I dessay he used to spend a good many spare spars and Russia duck," observ-&#xD;
ed a hard-featured topman.&#xD;
" You may say that, bo," replied Pipes, " and not so much as you'd fancy after&#xD;
all. Ue had a way of trimming her when the top-hamper seemed likely to give&#xD;
way, and it was just, shifting the helm a point or two, and at it again ; but what,.&#xD;
ever the damage was, his quick passage a' most always made all ends square, with&#xD;
a trifle logged dowgy in his favor. Captain Jack Deadeye was a broad Dutch-built&#xD;
little fellow, and no great beauty at the best of times-But avast ! I'm getting&#xD;
to t'other tack."&#xD;
" Aye, aye," said a listener, " stick to one course, mate."  . r&#xD;
"Well,' resumed Jack Pipes, good-humoredly casting a look, and giving Ed-&#xD;
ward a nod, as the latter in his awakened interest closed in with the group-" well,&#xD;
you must know that sometimes the wind sets in to the Channel here, blocking up&#xD;
the Dee and the Mersey just for all the world as if there was a great sea-wall&#xD;
built, and a whole fleet of merchantmen outward-bound have been boxing about&#xD;
for nigh-hand a month at a spell, which consarn, d'dye see, was a clincher to the&#xD;
owners, and ate into the profits of the voyage most preciously. This style of&#xD;
thing happened on an occasion when I was Captain Jack's cabin-boy, and the&#xD;
John Tobin lay at anchor in the ' Channel out of dock there, with her canvass&#xD;
down, ready to trip and be off, only, d'ye see, the wind set in such a steady nor'&#xD;
wester, as by the glass deemed likely to last many days before it blew itself&#xD;
out.&#xD;
" Captain Jack had a s'picion of this," continued Pipes, giving his quid a turn,&#xD;
and discharging from his-mouthi, through the port-hole, a jet of amber-hued saliva&#xD;

that would have discommoded a shark, had.there been one at hand to receive it ;&#xD;
and so, d'ye see, he had set all hands at double duty alow and 'aloft, and led the&#xD;
stevedore the devil's own life of it with the stowage of the cargo, for i spite of&#xD;
everything he meant to make a' run for it, and if he could but once round the&#xD;
bluffs and headlands at the Channels entrance, it would have been all right. All&#xD;
day long there had been a stiff, steady, squallish wind blowing, and as the evening&#xD;
came on matters did'nt mend_; but howsomever, there they were all aboard, only&#xD;
waiting the word to trip the anchor,,and 'sheet home,' and drop with the tide, if&#xD;
the wind wasn't bang a-head so strong as mayhap to have borne the. craft up to&#xD;
Runcorn-gap. The tide was on the turn at five in the morning, about the same&#xD;
time as the daylight began to wander out, and the mate, a Cornish man, and as&#xD;
thorough a seaman as ever broke biscuit, but a tartar for all that, was on deck the&#xD;
whole night waiting for Captain Jack to come aboard.'&#xD;
" Now the fact is that the skipper had been bousing his jib pretty taut with&#xD;
some old messmates at the ' Capstan-bar,' a, tavern kept by a buxom widow in&#xD;
Red Crose Street, somewhere beyond the Goree warehouse yonder ;" and Pipes&#xD;
pointed with his finger in the direction indicated. " Well, there I sat squatted in&#xD;
the bow, minding a bag of sundries as I had been to his house to bring, waiting&#xD;
for him to weigh ; but bless you, the company was too' good, and the grog too&#xD;
plentiful; there the half-dozen of blow-hards-and drink-hards too, for the matter&#xD;
of that-kept roaring and bellowing away till long past midnight, and the landla-&#xD;
dy' herself got tired of 'em-and she was as nice a craft-eyes like sloes, and lips&#xD;
like roses after the rain- However, about two o'clock in the, morning one or&#xD;
two takes it in their heads to knock off, that is, by doubling themselves under the&#xD;
table all at-once, and taking out a caulk, just as they tumbled off tlieir chairs."&#xD;
" In-hebriated, Jack, I s'poses," said a marine, with a strong metropolitan as-&#xD;
piration of the h;; and a highly congeited'air of polished superiority.&#xD;
"Well now," replied Pipes, turning 'upon the speaker- a loon of comical per-&#xD;
plexity and furtive fun, "if that means as they had stowed each under his belt as&#xD;
much liquor as would make the whole of the watch 'see twice as much as they do&#xD;
generally, you are right, and shiver my timbers ! they was in-hebriated, as you calls&#xD;
it."&#xD;
" After sharing hands, and so on, and making one or two wild bolts,,and bring-&#xD;
ing-up, suddenly, and-tacking through the passage and the street, we (that is Cap-&#xD;
tainJack' and me) made for the dock's side, the Princess's, away yonder, and&#xD;
as -there was a short cut through St. -Nicholas's Churchyard-the one as you see&#xD;
yonder,"-and Pipes pointed to an old tower which indicated the site of the-said&#xD;
venerable edifice, at the- foot of Water Street,-" why we made for it through&#xD;
Bunnel's Weind, and in the hazy moonshine, with my heart in my nouth and&#xD;
trembling like a leaf, I found myself crossing the churchyard ; Captain Jack, as he&#xD;
stumbled over the grave,stones, whistling the ' Black Joke,' and thinking no more&#xD;
of Davy Jones or his crew than I was of King Bomba or the black birds of para.&#xD;
dise on the costt"&#xD;
- " Cross a churchyard at night !" said a sailor, with a.thrill.&#xD;
"I say, Jack, is therea ghost in your yarn ?" then demanded another, in a tone of&#xD;
awe.&#xD;
"There is, bo', and I saw it to," answered Pipes.&#xD;
A murmur of admiration and astonishment ran round the group as Jack Pipes&#xD;
proceeded.&#xD;
" I heard the waters plash, and the winds sigh, and the gray -church looming&#xD;
like a three-decker in the hazy blink of the moon, and my heart was in my mouth,&#xD;
for I thought of ghosts, and of nothing else, d'ye sed; and though I .didn't care&#xD;
for the sight of any living thing, smash my taffrail, if that warn't all too much';&#xD;
but the skipper, with a stout'twig in his fist, held on, and lurched now and then&#xD;
rather heavy, when all at once "&#xD;
" Yes.-yes!" said' the seamen, wrought up to a pitch of excitement,.&#xD;

"All at once I saw a flash and heard a roar, and then, shipmates, from behind&#xD;
a grave-stone, rose a tall figure, all in white--."&#xD;
"iMy eye, Jack !" interrupted a mariner, whose teeth chattered as his fancy re-&#xD;
alized the description. '"Didn't you make sail ?"&#xD;
"I couldn't stir," said Pipes, " my feet were lead. It- gave a cry-a howl like&#xD;
a catamount, and held out its arms to the skipper, who said, ' What are you ?'--' I'm&#xD;
a sperrit,' says a voice,.-' Then vanish, and be d-d,' - said Captain Jack, hitting&#xD;
the ghost a crack with his stretcher thatsounded' like the sheet-block falling on&#xD;
Sambo White's coco'. 'Vanish,' says he ; 'you've no business to be out of your&#xD;
grave,' says he, ' at such an unreasonable hour;' and down it dropped with a yell&#xD;
that might have waked all the sleepers, while a second figure flung off a sheet, and&#xD;
scudded away for.the bare life."&#xD;
" Why then, Jack, the ghosts turned out to b:e-"&#xD;
"They proved to be a couple of footpads," said Jack ; "and glad enough I was&#xD;
as it turned out. We got out as the watch came in, and made for the pier-head&#xD;
with all speed.&#xD;
"'Boat, your honor?' says a man coming ups&#xD;
"' Halloo ! why it blows a few,' says Captain Jack.&#xD;
"'It does so,' said the boatman, ' and it'll do so for a month, and not a craft&#xD;
will be able to leave the riv er-"&#xD;
"' That's a lie, any how,' says the captain : ' for I mean the John Tobin to go ;&#xD;
so get half-a-dozen boats, and man them,-and if it's to be:done, we'll do it;' and&#xD;
so, when the captain got on. board, hawserswere passed forward ; the capstan&#xD;
manned ; the, Anchor tripped ; the jibs trimmed ;.and with lanterns lighted, and all&#xD;
hands out in the boats, the ship was fairly out in the Channel before the day was&#xD;
well out. He paid the watermen liberally, and they left us to tack, and box-haul,&#xD;
and beat our way as we best could; and we did it, for in four-and-twenty hours&#xD;
she was snoring away under every stitch of canvass ; and while a matter of fifty&#xD;
sail lay snug in the river, we were running down the Irish Channel, and soon fairly&#xD;
out to sea."&#xD;
"Well,'l continued Jack, "You may be sure that there was a pretty bobbery&#xD;
among the merchantmen, when: they knew we'had got out during 'the -night, and&#xD;
they couldn't start a single tack, for the weather got worse, and the greater num-&#xD;
ber put back into dock again, and days and weeks went by, while we were at the&#xD;
Bonny river, getting 'our palm oil and sandal wood, ivory, and so on abtad, with-&#xD;
out 'loss of an hour ; and I should say that ten days suffices to unload, stow a fresh&#xD;
cargo, fish up our cracked spars and-the rest of it ; and wasn't we all glad when&#xD;
the John Tobin made sail again for England, for of all the 'farnal hot places 'as ever&#xD;
I was in, I never was under such a sun."&#xD;
"And, how did you stand the voyage, being such a little 'un, Jack ?" asked a&#xD;
brother tar.&#xD;
" I s'pose I was borne to it," replied Jack ;' " and there was' a few old salts&#xD;
aboard as were' as wild as fury when they saw that I was neither sea-sick, nor&#xD;
afraid of taking a turn aloft, and didn't tumble into: the scuppers. as the vessel&#xD;
-made~a lurch ; and somehow Captain Jack took a fancy to me, and larnt me navi-&#xD;
gation on the passage, when he wasn't colting me with the bight of a sheet or any&#xD;
loose coil he could lay his hard fist upon-But hold hard !-getting abroad&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"Aye, aye ! steady helm, old Jack, and crack along," rose up around him in a&#xD;
tone of warning and encouragement.&#xD;
" So I will," responded Pipes. " Well, we sighted-England, after having been&#xD;
away for a matter of little more than two months; and after we-were fairly in the&#xD;
Mersey again, what d'ye think we saw, my lads ?"&#xD;
" Not the ghosts-or the footpads," said several laughing voices.&#xD;
"No," replied Pipes ; " but a whole fleet of the merchantmen-and almost&#xD;
every one on 'em the very same as we had left, when we made a~Start with the&#xD;

could draw. We had actually made the voyage out and home, while they had&#xD;
been kept in by contrary winds ;* and if Captain Jack didn't make his guns roar,&#xD;
and waste powder, while the crew made themselves hoarse with 'cheers, for every&#xD;
vessel they passed that day, I'm no man but a-porcupine, that's all. I've a notion&#xD;
that he made the skippers wild enough to have made a barbecue-of him, if they'd&#xD;
got him; and he didn't spare his bragging, I can tell you: and after all he could'nt&#xD;
be much blamed for it, seeing as he'd done what all thought was just impossible ;&#xD;
and this just placed him A 1 with his owners, who gave him a piece of plate, and'&#xD;
a dinner, and I don't know what-"&#xD;
The shrill piercing, and painfully acute cry of the boatswain's whistle rang sud-&#xD;
denly in their ears. Every man was silent and on the alert, and then the hoarse,'&#xD;
thunderous sounds of a voice that had become damaged by contention with the&#xD;
elements followed : " Cutters ahoy ! Away there! Bear a hand, you sea-dogs !&#xD;
Look alive, my sons !"&#xD;
While Edward was wondering what this command meant, half-a-dozen men, clad&#xD;
in snowy frocks and canvass trousers, with belted cutlasses by their sides; sprang&#xD;
over the side into a boat that swung by the " davits " or smell cranes which held&#xD;
the boat suspended. " Overhall the fall I" followed next. - " Lower away !" and&#xD;
with an officer in the stern, the men took their flashing oars, and at the words&#xD;
" Shove off! give way !" as by magic the blades clove the water, and with the low,&#xD;
slow, steady stroke peculiar to the man-of-war's-man, the boat was propelled to-&#xD;
wards the Liverpool side.&#xD;
,This incident, which was common enough to those aboard, was a fresh novelty to&#xD;
Edward ; and the picturesque appearance of the seamen in the boat, the regularity&#xD;
of their pulling, and the noiseless order of the whole, inspired him with a certain&#xD;
amount of admiration of the rigid and, faultless discipline feigning around him,&#xD;
even though he was likely to be a sufferer from the extreries to which it was&#xD;
carried.                  .                          I&#xD;
The group on the forecastle resumed their conversation when the bustle on the&#xD;
boat's departure was over, and various criticisms of a profoundly professional&#xD;
kind were unreservedly made upon the " yarn " which Jack Pipes had told them.&#xD;
Some few admired the seamanship, but. condemned the rashn ss,'of Captain Jack&#xD;
Deadeye, while one or two, more sceptical, would fain have ronounced the whole&#xD;
a " bam," a forgery, a cheat, a falsehood, in fact; if they had dared to brave the'&#xD;
storm of indignationthat such an open assertion would undoubtedly hav aroused ;&#xD;
for the story-teller on board ship is a man of too great imp stance to be treated&#xD;
with any undue disrespect.&#xD;
"I s'pose as how you doesn't believe in the ghosts ?" sai one disdainfully to&#xD;
another, more doubtful than his comrades.&#xD;
"Ghosts ! Why, didn't Jack say himself as they warn't gl osts, but land-sharks&#xD;
under false colors ?" was the reply.&#xD;
" Well, what of that?  More -likely to be true ; and I dessay as how you'll say&#xD;
there's no church yonder that hails as St. Nicholas, seeing ashow you can sight&#xD;
the tower this immediate minute, eh, you swab ?" scornfully r joined the other.&#xD;
This confirmation of the truth of Jack Pipes's yarn was o' so decided a nature&#xD;
that no farther dissentients ventured an opinion, save what was in every way&#xD;
favorable ; and Captain Jack's plan became now supported b a variety of curious&#xD;
eases in point, though their relevancy would have seemed so ewhat doubtful to&#xD;
any one that was particular as to the literal exactness of the testimony offered.&#xD;
"Talking of, Captain Jack Deadeye," observed another, "reminds me of a skip.&#xD;
per we used to call the ' Star-cleaver," from the way in which he used to make&#xD;
t'gallan'-sails, royals, sky-scrapers, and all serve him. If a squall came on he&#xD;
never stopped to take in canvass. ' Crack on,' says he, ' and  we'll get out of this&#xD;
before the scud comes on.' And then if the squall did cate him, he go so far&#xD;

ahead, and the wind would be so much weakened, that he hardly ever got into any&#xD;
great harm.&#xD;
"'Sides," added a second spokesman, "it's so easy to send them flying jigger-&#xD;
imaree things down ; and I know it's a good Yaihkee plan that of outsailing the&#xD;
wind, for there's many a good ship lost by clueing up, and waiting till it comes&#xD;
upon you, and you're in the middle-of. it--"&#xD;
"And then it's too late to shorten sail, and down comes your top-hamper, my&#xD;
boy, and then cut away is theword," suggested a bystander.&#xD;
" It may-hap so, and may-hap not," said Jack Pipes, ; " but all I know is,.that&#xD;
I've given you atrue log, and that's more than you can say for all the galley yarns&#xD;
you have ever uncoiled."&#xD;
The " yarn " party was over. The "pipe to dinner" was every moment ex-&#xD;
pected, and the cry of "scoldings'" had already sotinded from the cook's caboose.&#xD;
Edward, separated for the time from his companion in misfortune, who was' in a'&#xD;
different part of the ship, began, after the-interest of the, scene he had been a sharer&#xD;
in was over, to think of his own hopeless fate, and the depressing reaction was&#xD;
almost unbearable to him. He sighed bitterly, as his head sunk on his breast,&#xD;
while leaning against the bulwarks.&#xD;
A kindly hand patted him on' the shoulder; it was that of.Jack Pipes : "Come,-&#xD;
cheer up, my lad," said he; "«it's of no use to sink into a fit of-the doldrums ; and&#xD;
the bustle of a cruise will do you no great harm, if shot and wreck do not cut&#xD;
your life-lines. Better times will come, and you may yet lie up snugly ashore.&#xD;
Rely on Jack Pipes to help you if he can. I have seen more than one likely lad&#xD;
turn out a happy-go-lucky fellow."&#xD;
"Thank you for your consolation, and for your kindness," said Edward. "If&#xD;
anything can be a satisfaction for lost liberty, it will be that of meeting sympathy&#xD;
from one whose hairs have grown gray in the service."&#xD;
"Aye, aye, my lad, they're grizled enough," began Pipes.&#xD;
"Halloa,!" shouted a sailor, "here's Mother Dobbins in her bumboat, with a&#xD;
cargo of greens for the copper, and fresh eggs for the middies- "&#xD;
"And sink me if'there isn't the prettiest girl with her in the starn as I've ever&#xD;
lapped eyes on,-since I left Bet Skylight at the Point," added another ;1 and a&#xD;
group gathered once more together.&#xD;
"Bet .Skylight, besides having a face like a full moon, with all the colors painted&#xD;
.on it that go to the mixing of a bowl of punch, would make about four of her,''&#xD;
interposed another, with the air of a connoisseur.&#xD;
"EAh ! Bet was a fine woman for sartin, and could carry a press of sail !" added&#xD;
a fourth, 'admiringly.&#xD;
"iAnd a power of licker, too," said a fifth. '"By the same token, too, when in&#xD;
drink she was as playful as a young kid. I shall never forget the rattling she gave&#xD;
my box of ivories with a back-hander once for snatching a kiss of her. Zounds!1&#xD;
how she swore in defence of her vartue, as she called it."&#xD;
The#men were, not wrong in the conclusion they came to. In the stern of the&#xD;
shore-boat there certainly did sit as pretty a young girl as ever touched the im-&#xD;
pressionable heart of a sailor, and they all looked on her with undisguised admi-&#xD;
ration.&#xD;
"I do think the young creature is a piping of her eyes," exclaimed one, in a tone&#xD;
ct sympathy. "I wonder who she is in chase of. It is one of the new hands&#xD;
aboard."&#xD;
Edward pricked 'up his ears. He advanced to the side, and turning deadly pale,&#xD;
staggered back against Pipes. Too well did he know that pale and lovely face.&#xD;
" My cousin Rose I" murmured Edward, in a tone so low and broken that only&#xD;
Pipes was aware of it.&#xD;
The sailor had heard all Edward's story, and saw at a glance what it all meant.&#xD;
" Come 'below with me, my lad," said he, " and you shall' chatter with the bravo&#xD;
1MB8 in our mess-room, and I'll take care that no one interrupts you."&#xD;
" Oh, thanks! thanks I" said Edward, following him below.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
THE sHORE-BoAT-os           A RI v s.&#xD;
: WE must retrace our steps for.a short time, in order to see how Rose came to'&#xD;
have been so far successful in her adventurous plan of obtain ng a passage .to' the&#xD;
dreadful war-brig, when the whole had so discouraging an expect, and trium  ed&#xD;
over difficulties which seemed to be insuperable.&#xD;
Faithful to her purpose, Rose the next morning took a tender leave of her&#xD;
"mother" (asshe always; called Mrs. Palmer) and of the wo ried old man, and ac-,&#xD;
companied by. Charles, who Went part of the way for protection and company,&#xD;
made for Liverpool, by way ofKirkdale, where, taking leafe of her, with many&#xD;
a charge, and many a message -to his brother Edward, Rose , $ounted a coach that-&#xD;
then passed by, and in an hour descended at one of the great hotels, in Dale&#xD;
Street, from whence she had to make her way to the  house bf Mr.. Louis, which-&#xD;
lay between the docks and the river, in Trentham Street. Towards that direction&#xD;
she inquired her way. Mr.:Louis was well known, and the difficulty lessened.&#xD;
Rose felt no fear, and but little fatigue. She crossed the several bridges of the&#xD;
docks, the water-gates, where a sound and a rushing roar, like that of a 'small cat-&#xD;
aract, showed the dense weight of water sustained, by the mighty structure, espe-&#xD;
cially when the tide was low, in the basins. She marvelled 4t the numerous rows&#xD;
of shipping,:lying side by side; the forests of masts on all ha ds, where the white&#xD;
sails here and' there hung down in graceful folds. She noted the din of traffic, the&#xD;
busy hum of men, cargoes loading and unloading, and the thousand distracting&#xD;
but interesting sights that a ramble around the docks of a g eat sea-port perpetu-&#xD;
ally offer. Finally she arrived at her destination, and round Mr. Louis at&#xD;
home.&#xD;
- The worthy timber-merchant, on hearing her name, and D(arning her business,&#xD;
which a few minutes suftioed to do, received her with a paternal cordiality that in.&#xD;
one respect placed her at her ease.- - Introducing her to his $ife, a kind, ladylike&#xD;
'woman, who beldstate in a little parlor which looked riverward, both insisted, as&#xD;
a preliminary, that she should take some refreshment before doing aught else, to&#xD;
which Rose very sensibly acceded, for there was very likely a long fatiguing day&#xD;
before her, and she was bent upon going through it, at any cost.&#xD;
While partaking, then, of the refreshment so cordially offered her, she told her&#xD;
story with such a simplicity of air, that-rendered her bereavement ten times more&#xD;
pathetic than ever ; and the woman's heart of Mrs. Louis w ,s won to her at once,&#xD;
though her method of cheering up Rose's ,depression had. the triteness only of a&#xD;
woman of one idea.&#xD;
"I hope I shall give you but little trouble, Mr. Louis," said Rose in continua-&#xD;
tion, "and I only called to gather from you all the intelligence you can give me&#xD;
respecting my poor cousin-Edward"-here she-broke short off, to stifle her emo-&#xD;
tion and a hearty rising sigh.&#xD;
"My dear," he returned, in a friendly tone, "I am sorry that my information is&#xD;
not of the most cheerful kind ; Edward, I have ascertained, s on board the ten-&#xD;
der, lying in the river---"&#xD;
"The tender-!" exclaimed Rose, a little surprised.    \&#xD;
"-Yonder is the tender," said Mr. Louis, pointing to a dark, dismasted hulk,&#xD;
lying apparently, under the farther shire, but in reality, midway in the river.-&#xD;
"That old battered piece of timber is called the tender ; and from thence, if he be&#xD;
not already-removed, he will be taken, fora cruise, at all events, in yonder wasp of&#xD;
a gun-brig ;" and farther up, idly, but gracefully rocking at her anchors, he show. -&#xD;
ed Rose the "-Harpy," with her -elegant spars and intricate tracery of cordage,&#xD;
drawn with the fineness of a spider's web against the sky, as a back-ground,&#xD;
&#xD;
Rose was very pale as he spoke. " Is there, then, no chance for his release:?"&#xD;
Mr. Louis looked very grave, and shook his head in the negative. '" Ifear not,"&#xD;
said he, "' and regret it the more, as he was such a promising -young man, and the&#xD;
son of one I have respected for so many years. - I have made all inquiry, and&#xD;
pressed his freedonri as i'favor on the magistrates," continued: Mr. Louis ; "but&#xD;
from the evasive nature of the answers - I received, aid the great demand there&#xD;
is for men at the present moment, I fear there is not a shadow" of hope."&#xD;
Rose:felt a dreadful:faintness seize her, as she beheld the only chances left this&#xD;
destroyed. Up to that moment she h'ad vaguely believed in the existence of some&#xD;
of those events that,"like'auling Providence, at -the last moment interfere to save&#xD;
when least expected.-But here was a man who was friendly disposed .in every&#xD;
way-who had, in fact, exerted himself-who wdald not willingly bid her relin-&#xD;
quish hope,,if ever so, small.-+-here he was telling her that none remained for her,&#xD;
or Edward, or any one. 'It was a' dreadful.blow, but she bore it well.&#xD;
" I must see him," said she, rising to her feet.&#xD;
"My dear child--" began Mr. Louis.&#xD;
"I must see him--if only for a moment," and her looks. grew wild and voice&#xD;
harsh.&#xD;
It is piot possible," he said.&#xD;
"iIf only at a distance," persisted Rose,--.--" I shall die if I do not-; and die I Will&#xD;
not, if it pleases heaven, until I do, Oh'! Sir," she cried,' in accents that pierced&#xD;
.his heart, "if you have tpity on-, a poor heart-broken "girl,:ldnds me your as-&#xD;
sistance,-or show me' how thisis to, be done," 'and she seized-his- hand. -&#xD;
".Can't you possibly manage it-for the poor thing, my dear  John?" said Mrs.&#xD;
Louis, weeping out of' very sympathy.&#xD;
"Not a boatman willventu e-eqt to 'them, I fear," was',his despairing reply,&#xD;
when Rose again broke in.&#xD;
"'I -have some money with me, sir," she said. :"' Can the offer of a reward not&#xD;
induce any of them to go ?"&#xD;
"I should not be sparing of a little money myself; for the lad's sake,' replied&#xD;
Mr. Louis. "But the dread:of the -' press-gang' is greater than self-interest, and&#xD;
the boatmen know that they would not be safe fromthe-grasp of those constantly&#xD;
looking, out for them' Liberty to' the poorest is so priceless-..'."&#xD;
" Alas ! and what must be the agonies of Edward" e claimed ' Rose, clasping&#xD;
her hands, " to be deprived of his-to lose home, liberty-all--'=to -be lost to his&#xD;
parents-hisIbrother-to me I' and sinking in'a chair, she gave way'to a fit of&#xD;
passionate tears she ho longer had the power to repress.&#xD;
The ,scene was' distressing, and Mrs. Louis was greatly agitated., Mr. Louis&#xD;
had taken his telescope,"and at the open window of the'little parlor' had pointed&#xD;
it towards the Cheshire coast, towards whichhe turned his eyes with an attention&#xD;
that seemed' to have been -most vividly awakened by some 'object or other that. en-&#xD;
grossedhim. At last turning away, and closing his glass, . "I have it," he said,&#xD;
cheerfully ; "I think it can be done, after all.'&#xD;
" Oh-lF sir; heaven will bless you!' Thank you-thank you !" cried Rose, in a&#xD;
transport, her tearful eyes all in a sparkle again. " Oh ! how very good 'you are&#xD;
ir !"&#xD;
"Cheer up, cheer tip," said Mr. Louis, gaily : " yes, you shall see him, but in-&#xD;
deed you must be contented with that-."&#xD;
"And not speak to him ?" and the face of Rose grew clouded again.&#xD;
"I don't mean that," he said; "but you must make up your mind to part with&#xD;
him for awhile---"&#xD;
"I'll try," replied Rose ; " and I think-I- could do it cheerfully, if I saw him,&#xD;
and spoke to him, and-and took leave of him," continued Rose, stoutly ; "and&#xD;
then I could hope for his return ; but I should hope for nothing, if I knew noth-&#xD;
ing of him, you see, sir."&#xD;
" Well, my child, resume your hat and shawl, and follow me," said Mr. Louis,&#xD;
getting his own hat. " I know that I can get across to the ferry in a custom-&#xD;

house boat ; perhaps it will hail the tender in passing, when we shall know to a&#xD;
ertainty where your lover is. Nay, don't blush, my pretty Rose," he continu-&#xD;
ed, patting her on the shoulder ; "there is nothing to be ashamed of in honest&#xD;
love."&#xD;
No Sir," responded Rose, who was quite ready and a little impatient, "I know&#xD;
there is not, and I am not ; and so--"&#xD;
" And so we will hasten,"- said Mr. Louis, as Rose bade a kind good-bye to Mrs.&#xD;
Louis, and thanked the old lady for her attention, and for her sympathies on her&#xD;
behalf.&#xD;
Walking smartly until they came to St. George's Pier, Er. Louis spoke a few&#xD;
wordsto a waterman, who wore the jacket and hat of a custom-house officer. It&#xD;
so happened, that the boat lay then at the steps, and that ie was going to be ta.&#xD;
ken on board a vessel just then coming up the river ; and to oblige Mr. Louis he&#xD;
promised to land him at the first ferry, but more he could not do, as his time would'&#xD;
not permit him. This was done, and both crossed the river, but too far down to&#xD;
hail the tender, or recieve any information regarding those on board. Giving the&#xD;
men a' gratuity for their trouble, Mr. Louis took Rose's ar  under his, and direct-&#xD;
ed his steps to a ferry some half-a-mile away up the shore, and opposite to where&#xD;
the gun-brig lay, where they soon arrived.&#xD;
" I thought so," exclaimed Mri Louis ; " there's Mother] Dobbins in b' r store.&#xD;
boat going to the gun-brig. Hallo ! boat ahoy!. Mother-Mother Dobbins," he&#xD;
.shouted, as the large flat-bottomed .craft, laden with vegetables, linen, milk and&#xD;
purser's "stores," which was just-putting off, held back a moment, and a ruddy.&#xD;
face dame stepped heavily ashore, as -our two friends hastned to meet .her; .and&#xD;
in a few hasty words Mr. Louis told her the whole of . he -matter which had&#xD;
brought them there, and at once enlisted the tenderness'of the old woman in their&#xD;
favor.-&#xD;
"Mother Iobbins," as she was familiarly called, was an old farmer's wife, built&#xD;
in the same scale of breadth as her boat,-a female of many petticoats, great&#xD;
weight, and much importance. She possessed a fund of irscible good nature, the&#xD;
.former quality being easily aroused by the jokes of the young mischievous men-of-&#xD;
war's men ; but she was capable of doing a generous and  disinterested action, and&#xD;
had more than once befriended the scapegraces who might by some overt act have&#xD;
got themselves into difficulty-sometimes.into danger.&#xD;
"1 can't take you on board," she said to Mr. Louis. in reply to his application,&#xD;
" but the pretty girl I will. Lord ! it makes me think of Black-eyed Susan going&#xD;
to see her William after a cruise. You see, Mr. Louis (fdr.the builder was well&#xD;
known,) the brig's under sailing orders, though p'r'aps they don't know it yet on&#xD;
board, and the captain has forbidden any of the " male seats," as he calls 'em (he's&#xD;
a zion of nobility, they calls him ;) but as for the lassie, bless her pretty face-..&#xD;
Come int my dear, sit in the.stern ; and do you, old chap, go in and have a chat&#xD;
with my good man in the cottage. We shall be back in hlfran-hour or so. Shove&#xD;
off, old Jack-shove off. There, dry your eyes my pretty," she continued, ad.-&#xD;
dressing Rose, as the boat fell away, and with two powerful sweeps was being&#xD;
pulled to the ship; "dry your eyes, my darling, and you'll see your lover. Here&#xD;
we are alongside ; and now do you follow me ;" and mounting on deck without&#xD;
ceremony, led the blushing Rose forward, when, descendinginto the mess-room, over&#xD;
which Jack Pipes held sway, Rose with a throbbing. heart was pressed to her&#xD;
lover's bosom..&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
T HE INTERvIEW.&#xD;
"RosE, my own, own darling," exclaimed Edward, when they werE alone,&#xD;
Mother Dobbins being busied with the purser, and Pipes at his post,-" Rose, my&#xD;
own love," and he strained her to his heart, " bless you and thank you for this&#xD;
meeting.. I did not think I should ever have seen you again, and this has lighten-&#xD;
ed my heart of a great weight of sorrow."&#xD;
"1Oh Edward ! dear Edward !" said Rose, "I never felt the force of my be-&#xD;
reavement till this moment. - To hold you thus, and to know that in a short, short&#xD;
time I shall be torn from you, breaks my heart, and I feel that I am not so strong&#xD;
as I ought to be under the circumstances-."&#xD;
"Is there, then, no chance ?" asked Edward, hastily.&#xD;
"None, Edward, none," she sobbingly returned. "Mr. Louis has, with a gen-&#xD;
erosity worthy of him, done all that possibly can be done : but they throw delays&#xD;
in the way, and raise all sorts of frivolous objections, and want men, they say.-&#xD;
Besides, I hear that the vessel is to sail  "&#xD;
" To sail!l When ?" demanded . Edward.&#xD;
" Soon ; to-day, perhaps, or to-morrow-"&#xD;
" Listen, Rose," he interrupted, his face darkening under the force of the indig-&#xD;
nant passion which moved him.. " I feel that I cannot submit to the tyranny of&#xD;
this act, which places me in mortal array against those I know not, and have&#xD;
never received or done an injury to. I shall endeavor to escape-"&#xD;
" Escape !" replied Rose, trembling ; " but how ? will it not be dangerous? Can&#xD;
it be safely done ?"&#xD;
" I do not know," was his answer ; " but as well perish in endeavoring to be&#xD;
with you, as perish hopelessly far away from you. Besides, I cannot bear to be&#xD;
parted from Charles. I have had such restless dreams of him. How is he ?" he&#xD;
added, abruptly.&#xD;
" He is quite well," replied Rose, " but much dispirited and cast down. He&#xD;
knew the same night that something had happened to you, for you appeared to&#xD;
him, he.said, as he was going to bed&#xD;
"As he was going to:bed," repeated Edmund, dreamily. " Aye, the sympathy&#xD;
between us is as mysterious as it is true," he murmured ; " and it must have been&#xD;
at the time that I was struck senseless by-one of the ruffians who attacked me;&#xD;
for I have a vague consciousness that the activity of.the soul was not suspended,&#xD;
and that I did indeed hold a communication with him."&#xD;
" It is almost awful," said Rose, in a subdued voice.&#xD;
"And my old mother-my poor father," said Edward, "how did they sustain&#xD;
.my absence? Do not disguise anything from me. How did you leave :them at&#xD;
home this morning ?"&#xD;
" Very sad-very sorrowful, Edward ;" and Rose here told him how the old&#xD;
man, on Charles relating his vision to him, had hastened to town the next day,&#xD;
and with what result ; adding, also, that she had decided to do so, and the success&#xD;
which attended her.&#xD;
"My- brave Rose !" exclaimed Edward ; and once more clasped her to his&#xD;
breast. " Am I not much altered, Rose ?"&#xD;
" You are paler, and you have suffered," replied Rose, gazing more earnestly in-&#xD;
to his countenance than before ; and then she saw that under his hat he wore. a&#xD;
bandage, and that his forehead was bound with strapping where he had received&#xD;
two or three cuts. "Good heaven !" she cried, " you have been wounded---"&#xD;
"It's not much," returned Edward, with a melancholy smile. " It's.---"&#xD;
" Sorry to interrupt you," said Pipes, suddenly putting in his head at the sliding&#xD;

entrance, " but you must bear a hand ; for the little warbler must soon go ashore,&#xD;
and the boatswain will be round in the twinkling of a handspike ;" and again he&#xD;
closed the entrance.&#xD;
"Must I go so soon, then, Edward ?' asked Rose, convulsively.&#xD;
"I fear so," he replied, sadly; "but I was speaking of escaping--"&#xD;
" Yes," she tremulously said,; ' but it will be attended. with great danger, will&#xD;
It not? I tremble for you, dear Edward."&#xD;
I do not tremble for myself,": he replied, "but for you-for all that is so dear&#xD;
to me. - Oh II cannot, I cannot submit to this, and yet I know not what I had&#xD;
better do."&#xD;
"Do nothing,'Edward," said Rose, "if there is the slightest chance of making&#xD;
your condition worse than it is. They do tell such dreadful stories of punish-&#xD;
niento - -"&#xD;
",Aye, my Rose," hebegan, "and what is worse, the most dreadful stories that&#xD;
they tell have good-grounds for belief."&#xD;
"What do you mean, Edward ?" asked Rose, her alarm roused afresh. " What&#xD;
will they do to you?"&#xD;
" Whythey will not do anything more to me now if I am submissive and obedi-&#xD;
ent, andiwill kill:and slay when they bid me; and put arms in my hand," returned&#xD;
Edward. " They exact nothing but the most .implicit obedience, and then all is&#xD;
well."&#xD;
"But if you are taken in the act of escaping ?" asked Rose, " what will they do&#xD;
to you then, Edward ?"-&#xD;
"Punish me as a deserter," he replied.&#xD;
"Punish you! How ?" said Rose, turning pale.1&#xD;
"By hogging, perhaps, was his answer.,    -&#xD;
" Merciful God 1" exclaimed Rose, ".that must surely not be."&#xD;
"And that is not all," continued he, with savage playfullness.t&#xD;
" Not all! Alas ! what more can they do ?"&#xD;
"They can hang meto the yard-arm of the vessel-so I have been told," said&#xD;
Edward ; " and they.can, do no more.".&#xD;
Rose almost fainted from the added terrors which this probability gave to tl&#xD;
fate of her lover. That he, so handsome in form, and so good in hart, should be&#xD;
flogged like a hound, o'r hanged at the yard-arm, for the very natural attempt to&#xD;
escape. from a capture that no law, iot even that of expediency, could justify,&#xD;
seemed too appalling to be true. And yet it was so ; and she felt it fartoo intensely&#xD;
to believe otherwise.&#xD;
" Oh, 'Edward ! Edward !" she moaned, " what a fate is our's I"&#xD;
" Aye, dear Rose, and what a fate is that of many, who like. ourselves, full o,&#xD;
the impulse of fresh, young, loving hearts, are torn asunder at a stern and merciless&#xD;
mandate which tramples every feeling of humanity under foot, and. recognises no&#xD;
right save that of the strongest.and the law of conquest.".&#xD;
" You must:not -attempt to escape," said Rose, hurriedly.&#xD;
"No !" and Edward smiled. " WhyoRose, there would be nothing.to run from,&#xD;
if it were not for lash and halter, and men might take a trip to sea as a healthy&#xD;
exercise : do yousee that -"'&#xD;
"But you must- promise me not to attempt it," interrupted Rose. - " I shall&#xD;
have no.rest, no. sleep, no, peace.. I will bear. all your absence, Edward. I will'&#xD;
love you, think of you, be your own Rose, praying for you when far away, but do&#xD;
not, do not, think of escaping ! Promise me that, I beg of you !"&#xD;
While she spoke, both sitting on a 'sea-chest, in., the darkened space, his arm&#xD;
being round herrwaist, and she drawn to his breast, Pipes hi d entered unheard.&#xD;
his quick ear.detected the word ""escape I" and his mind, accustomed to judge the&#xD;
desire 'of freedom urging a young man from former scenes, told him at once Ed-&#xD;
war d's enin Pipes, a~s they started on seeing imu, " I h ard what was said ;&#xD;

CHAPTER, XL&#xD;
LEAVING   aog.&#xD;
WE left Charle , after having-parted from Rose sauntering slowly back; but&#xD;
he felt no desire to return homejust then, The'poie and hubbub of the fair co-&#xD;
tinued from the previous ;day, and crowds filled the boohs, the taverns, and the&#xD;
streets; through which'Sergeant Kitly, within sfluttering;ribbons, perambulated,&#xD;
with drum andf-fe, and lied his trade with a pealthtlmest would have called&#xD;
commendable, if it had not been of so equivocal a hature ; buthis .uceep wasi&#xD;
nomeans despjqab, to jtlge by the rout that, with cockades n.their Batttred&#xD;
'felt hats, staggered '9 a sort of h.lf-tipsy gloryater him.&#xD;
The sght of this riap, pomponss, self-sufficieri, silent, and' fill f  ile, renew-&#xD;
ed at once all Charles,'s dislike to the:prpfession; and the recQsctiqn. the scene&#xD;
he had witnessed the previous ;day, when tle; sill Robbert Morris fe1 into the&#xD;
toils, came upon him with a freshsense of repulsiveness. He was passing,. ward,&#xD;
with his hat draw ,a little over hi Prows, his foeh d dark with a frpwn, and his&#xD;
step sickened, he by an active ianceuvre,- the ,ergeant, bo-ght his. burly&#xD;
form in the way, and they met face to fpe, Evidently this was done intentionally&#xD;
on the part of the soldier.    '      3'              'x           .{  ly&#xD;

of a little sister I once had... Tke my adyike, submit to what can't be helped,&#xD;
and dopt thipk of. maing a 'run' of t. Depend upon it, it will enA badly."&#xD;
"Listen to him  Idhard,"paid it se  asLiten to this kind old man, who wil&#xD;
always aid and  sit' you.&#xD;
" If Jack Pipes can stand between you and harm, he'll do it," resumed the&#xD;
sailor. " And a for helping and assisting, ipy pretty dear, why' to be sure I will,&#xD;
bless your sweet eyes and so ceer up. What can't&#xD;
It'll only be a cruise. -&#xD;
" 0  ye, Edward, ft' will be' better to submit," said Rqse  " Tell me that you&#xD;
think so.&#xD;
"If you think so, Rose," said'; Edwad, deectedly. "I will prondse you to&#xD;
submit to any fate rather than add to your grief."&#xD;
"It is:because tt iichces of begae  '' began Rose.&#xD;
" The chances now, mnterrup     pipes, " are ninety to one against yon  The&#xD;
sentries aredoubled.."- The brig is under saying orders to the seuth, 'Portsmouth, or&#xD;

he walked away displying a taste 'that ;gas of the most tender and refined nature.&#xD;
The part ng between the lovers was saddening enough and tears interrupted&#xD;
their kisses.  The fervent "od bles you !" was spoken, the last embrace given,&#xD;
and Rose wasin the boat--her eyes, blinded by, a milt of tears--while Edward&#xD;
continued to wateh it to the Iast.&#xD;

"Soh, my fellow,", said the sergeant, with a flourish df his rattan, "would a&#xD;
likely youiig chap; like oi1, choose to serve the king, and win for yourself fame&#xD;
and glory, a commission, and a commp nd, eh ?"&#xD;
The flashing eyes of;Charles, and the stern look which fixed upon the ser&#xD;
gant's face, told the latter that the reply, but for obvious regions, would be more&#xD;
emphatic than the negative shake of the head with which Charles received his&#xD;
proposal.&#xD;
Soh, so !" said the sergeant, with an oath. "-Zound , have we a rebel here,&#xD;
that he looks so black upon his sacred majesty's officers? Do you turn your nose&#xD;
up at the service, young fellow, that you look so cursedly supercilious."&#xD;
If you inean to ask' me whether' I am fool enough to le caught by your chaff&#xD;
and your glitter," retorted Charles, "I should fancy that you need not long'wait for&#xD;
your answer. I am neither drunk nor starving ; and as for #ehonor of the service-&#xD;
wyu it's in good keeping, I 'dare 'say,;n  respect it, in its representative, accord-&#xD;
ingly."  And while expressions of approbation-from several, whom the altercation&#xD;
brought round, arose, Charles pushed  and hurried on.&#xD;
a You lily-livered insolent," said the sergeant,' between his teeth, and greatly&#xD;
disconcerted, for he thought to have got better off with onie of his rude and broad&#xD;
retorts; but the play was against him, and, with. a bitter oath of vengeance, he&#xD;
swallowed his chagrin and went on.,&#xD;
Charges was leaving the town, ly the Walton path, Khen a pretty road-side&#xD;
cotta  caught his attention, and as window and door were open, he could scarcely&#xD;
hel     ing in ;'and there, seated dejectedly on a chair, with his throbbing brow&#xD;
resting everishl on his hands, sat Robert Morris. Charles recognised him at&#xD;
once. It was a neat cottage, tastefully but hunmblyi.furn shed. The mother was&#xD;
busied with her household work, casting now' and. then  look of anxious sadness&#xD;
'uspon her sonthe pride of her 'age-while two or threi younger children were&#xD;
playing but not noisilyas if intimidated and afraid, hy the back-door, which opened&#xD;
into a little trim garden. A young woman, of about' eighteen,rpale and rather&#xD;
pretty, but worn with anxiety and deep trouble, was tryhik to persuade the lad to&#xD;
take some tea, which sheheld out 'to hiu' n'basm. ; buhe only shook his head,&#xD;
and made no reply. Charles saw that his grief washintese, and settled; that the&#xD;
recollection of his ridiculous excesses weighed upon him, and that the reflection of&#xD;
the day succeeding his debauch were of the most agonizing kind. It did not seem&#xD;
that he had confided to them the secret of his fate. The heaviest blow of all was&#xD;
yet to come, and Charles lingered without, anxious to, know the result, yet dread-&#xD;
The roll of the drum, and the squeak of the fife, was heard in the distance, and&#xD;
apparently coming that way. The youth started. His cheeks were blanched, and&#xD;
his lips white, and his appearance would have moved the compassion of the hardest&#xD;
man.             .'mt'te'tata'adarO&#xD;
"Robert," said his mother to hin, soothingly, "take the tea, tat's a dear b oy,&#xD;
it will do you good ; and we will forgive the past, and hope and pray for the future."&#xD;
" All hope is over for me, mother,"' he said,.in a d hollow voice.lher&#xD;
Jane tremulously placed the tea on the table, and affectionately puttingher&#xD;
hand upon his' shoulder, said, "What makes you say that, Robert?  There is&#xD;
always hope, you know."f                            i    the foorreply.&#xD;
He took out of his pocket a crumbled cockade, and tlug it on  r, in rlyh.&#xD;
That,and the aspect of his face, told them the whole store of his error, his fatal, his&#xD;
irretrievable error. The mother and Jane gazed on othadreadful token as though&#xD;
it were some poisonous' snake; and, indeed, the analogy. Would have been but too&#xD;
true a one. Neither spoke ; but with a shudder they sat down in stupified and&#xD;
despairing silence.&#xD;
The children, young as they were, appeared to be completely awed at the sight&#xD;
of the silent grief they witnessed, with a strag fear tOne hdo-olittlr'in halfrwld&#xD;
to:its mother's feet unheeded, while the gir? jl y tohldohemtersao,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
and the little boy, at ast taking courage, walked towards his brother, and saw'-&#xD;
the cockade.&#xD;
" That's the pretty ribbon the soldier gave you yesterday," said the boy, stoop.&#xD;
ing to pick it up, when Robert,gavea starton his chair.&#xD;
" Don't touch it," almost shrieked out Robert. " It is even dangerous. Don't&#xD;
touch it-let it be. It has-done for eme,. and touching it is dangerous for any.&#xD;
"Well, good folks, a pleasant day to you," said the sergeant, entering at the&#xD;
moment. .I am come to tell my young friend here that, time's p.p, ' march' is the&#xD;
word, and the order for advance to the depot is given. Say good bye,' my boy,&#xD;
andei rout 'for Liverpool."                                    s   t&#xD;
"Liverpoql?" muttered Charles,, to himself, as a fancy,.he gave no utterance to,&#xD;
struck -hi.&#xD;
Why, how's this," continued the sergeant, "here's your gay ribbon on the floor.&#xD;
,What ! not chicken-heaited, eh ? pooh ! nonsense ."&#xD;
,he se geant picked up the cockade, and spread it out, with a great show ofeare&#xD;
and pride. "Give me a pin, mother," said he, with a sort of free and easy air," and&#xD;
let's fsten his colorsto him. He'll be proud of them some day, and sowill.you too."&#xD;
"Ohsir" pried, the mother, " what's this you've done ? and what has made you&#xD;
rob me of. myboy.?-&#xD;
R Ib you of your boy !" said the sergeant. "Nonsense. Give me a pin."  He&#xD;
then finned it on Robert's jacket, and turning round, said," Come, come,, don't&#xD;
take on. You see the king wants soldiers, and pays liberally for them, besides the&#xD;
chances of .advancement ; and when he comes back to you, he'll be a brave soldier&#xD;
who will be telling you of the things he.has:seen-'"&#xD;
" L would rather, he was.in his grave," said'the mother.&#xD;
"See him a month,hence," continued: the segeant, "when he's got his handsonie&#xD;
uniform on, and his sword by his side, and gold epaulettes on his shoulders ; when&#xD;
e's drilled and the rest of it; when-damme-when he's a soldier, in fact ; and&#xD;
then you may. be proud of him---&#xD;
"Oh! that he had never been born ," moaned the widow.&#xD;
" Why,.that's unrateful in you, mother," said the heartless sergeant. " Would&#xD;
you spoil fortune wlien she's ready to make a great man of him"?" .&#xD;
ButDane Morris was stupi Iedt She sank into a chair,:and with the ypunget&#xD;
child in her arms,,placed herhands over her face, and gave vent to. a grievous&#xD;
mon an  i, pallid 'as death,.and speechless, only hung on Robert's sboulders,&#xD;
and gazed lovingly in his face...&#xD;
A shiver ran throughall the 'limbs. of the do med youth.&#xD;
Mother, mother,".said he, hurriedly; "kis nie-forgive me--bless me-a d&#xD;
say'good bye.,. I have been a bad son, and ,may be ,a worse man. It's best as it&#xD;
is. Speak to me, mother-speak you, Jane."&#xD;
But Dame Morris had'grown hght-headed, and began to say that she would -all&#xD;
upon Mr. Freshvill,,for he might help her ifIhe would The grin.an ,hd .indu-&#xD;
ence ;i and,- besides,. he. had a relation a. major,  captam', or songething;of that&#xD;
kind, in the army. It might be of, service, it might not; but, at all events! a&#xD;
chance however small must not be cast away. And- Charles, as he overhead&#xD;
them speak of the father of Ellen, wondered how it wasthey knew him.: It turned&#xD;
out, however, that they were tenants of Mr.' Freshville, and  e sighed ,t the&#xD;
thought of how useless any such appcation would be..&#xD;
In the meantime Robert had. kissed his ipother, embraced Jane, and witl a&#xD;
dreadful cry of heart-wrung anguish, had rushed forth from the house, while the&#xD;
poor woman still sat muttering to herself that she would have him released, apd&#xD;
the sergeant, marched off with his -prize.&#xD;
"Ie'll be a soldiervhen he comes, back." .Charles overheard Jane, with her&#xD;
ghastly face, say. "Alas! will he ever come back?  Few of them 'do"&#xD;
- Yery few, Jane, and those who dio return, crippledl for life, see unloving objects&#xD;
enough then, and'depend upon human char-ity for their hard-doled alms.&#xD;
tu the price ofa glory, however, and must be paid," said Charles ; and I~e in&#xD;
tunwent his way thinking of his brother~ Ed ward, and what'success Rose would hai'e.&#xD;

Harpy appeared on this day that'bheath a scorching stin, and in a breeze that&#xD;

She wears armlets, too, magnificent jeweller,-fr is there not around her masts&#xD;
a gleaming array of steel battle-axes, pnd are 'not the flashing l oarding-pikes so&#xD;

pistols ; pikes, and grappling-irons are in'her tops, with chests of small-ajms ready&#xD;
to replace any of the lost,-for theEfarpy is 'profuse, and 'very careless.&#xD;
After all, she is beautiful, but just as beautiful as thesnake is, with its hues of&#xD;

a pair of purser's lops, cgmpldadcostume which made the crew appear part&#xD;
and parcel of theornamergts ofthe Harpy on that especial day. Blue, and white,&#xD;
and gpld, varied the costume qf the captain, and the officers'; and the gigantic&#xD;
bo'sun, with his: hairy arms, bared,: and his silver whistle suspended rud 3his&#xD;
negk, mstat not. be omitted in thi} eatglogne of the Harpy's full dress ball cos-&#xD;
tume.&#xD;
Ifnthe Ijiarpy, however, with her, crew of dare alls, with her "bulldogs," her&#xD;
boarders, her nimble topnlen ,her reeyles  .waisters," and her mnimi powder-mon-&#xD;
keys, who, {children as theywere, had it;flashing under their goses by the hoin-&#xD;
if the Harpy wor ean air so winnip, so holiday-like, so munh like youi- sweetheart&#xD;
going to merry-makirng, it was not to conceal the fierce and robyist joy thafseemed&#xD;
to, pervade every fibreef her frame. Her timbers trembled for joy ; she was geigg&#xD;
to meet her .groom--like a bride decked for marriage-aid she would salute. him&#xD;
with an embrace from which nothing could unclasp her arms. She was going into&#xD;
battle ; and, byheavens.! if'oak and;iron, cord, and woven cloth could rejoice, she&#xD;
sailed rejoicingly, lightly, gajlyr-like thosp courtiers of the past regimes who&#xD;
would go to a duello the next morning, perfumed, and dressed in their richest,&#xD;
handsomest suits of bravery, after having parted, with smiles and stately bows, from&#xD;
their intended opponents on the previous night.&#xD;
It did not require much at any time to -compel such a metamorphosis of the&#xD;
Harpy as would have staggered you, good reader. Her laughing air would harden&#xD;
into a sardonic grin. She would tuck up her vestments~in a trice, and out of ev-&#xD;
ery jewel-box would issue thunders lightnings, and a hail of iron as deadly as ever&#xD;
broke out of Egypt. Her resounding batteries would pour forth volley upon vol-&#xD;
ley ; like so many huge forges opening their furnaces, -the vivid combustion was&#xD;
seen a moment in eruption, and next felt! tier roaring, like a monster in a fit of&#xD;
rage;,.quelled .the elements. Only the hungry waves- thirsted for her.; but though&#xD;
gaping, and torn to,the very water's edge-being one huge and bleeding wound-&#xD;
still she defied all,;,  still the defiant. cry arose ; still the commandof" Fire ! fire f" was&#xD;
heard ; and even when rolling, disinasted, not a single particle of her noble and stately&#xD;
-spect of the :past hour visible-she was gay, rejoicing, and buoyant as before.--&#xD;
One immitigable burst, one broadside, one final blow, and then she wpuld be alone&#xD;
on the;sea, herenemy in the depths-.--or rather,,her bridegroom strangled-for in&#xD;
her horrible amours she was insatiate ; and then she would roll heavily into port&#xD;
again, he~r' tor flag;flying from a staff raised where it could, and anon she would&#xD;
re-issue foith, gay, brave, and beautiful, and, plunge into her furious Bacchanal&#xD;
orgie with' as much, zest as ever! And if her paintings, her rogue, her v million,&#xD;
her plumage, were soiled and disfigured, she would come forth in green. nd gold,&#xD;
in azure and crimson, with a younger look than ever-a younger loot-but one&#xD;
more immodest., ,Qh! how this Ilarpy longed for such another lover, such another&#xD;
bridegroom, to jll with her stifling ,embraces-to kill with.her kindness&#xD;
Like a vultur , she scented the 'attle, afar off. The brows of her commander&#xD;
expanded. . The broad chests of her tarry llerculeses-her children-grew still&#xD;
wider} as they stretched forth their arms-and toyed with her adaamantine jewels, and&#xD;
bedecked, themselves with them. How.she strained tack aigd sheet, sail and stay,&#xD;
and checked the eager bending of, her masts, like .a racer :approaching the goal,&#xD;
whenthe foe. came in sight! low she plunged on, dashing the haughty- waves&#xD;
withhanghtier ,bound!I. How she answered, even when most eager, the slightest&#xD;
touch of her helm-the smallest pull upon brace or sheet ! How she sang in ev-&#xD;
ery'vibrating cord, converting the whole into an .Eolian harp, and sounding a&#xD;
battle .nare l' How the, men clustered at.the guns, and trifled with the monsters,&#xD;
alone would toy withchildren ! Then, with :t    oarding- settings triedd up-..&#xD;
bristling like a w lf at lhay-and the hammock-cloths on her bulwarks, with her&#xD;
sails shortening, like a boxer stripping, to his work, how she would range herself&#xD;
'p, and coquettishly give a salite with an unshotted gun, as much as to say,&#xD;

" Fire first, gentlemen -fire first. The Harpy always receives the first blow, and&#xD;
then-look to it !"  Such would be her significant aspect.&#xD;
Just like a lovely young girl with perfumed 'garments, odorous hair, and cheeks&#xD;
with the slightest touch' of the rose in them, entering the' ball-room, so was the&#xD;
Harpy. Then when the inspiring music rose up, and made the llood palpitate,&#xD;
and the heart throb, and kindled the eyes with a dazzling light, and made the cheeks&#xD;
crimson, so would the Harpy color up, and 'thrill through from her ;keel 'to her&#xD;
'very truck-from stem to stern.&#xD;
Look now at the beautiful 'girl, abandoning 'herself to the fascinations of the&#xD;
dance. Her hair is tossed from its arrangement, her garments float- in the air,&#xD;
which they' perfume in passing (and the 'Harpy leaves . on the air a perfume of&#xD;
burnt powder;)' and so-in a very shoit time afterthe music of the "ocean-dance,&#xD;
the sword song had begun, would sheyield herself up to the fierce trance, and care&#xD;
no more for appearance; only rejoicing 'in the delirium which warmed her in the,&#xD;
fight. More analogies would offer but we must omit them now. - Hurrah ! she is&#xD;
going to join the fleet, and meet the foe'!&#xD;
"g This is certainly a fine introduction to a dissertation on the horrors of war,"&#xD;
Inethinks I hear the reader say.' "For my part, friendly reader," I reply, that&#xD;
"just now I cannot, for the'life of me, help it."'-&#xD;
C HA PT ER      XII I.-&#xD;
MAKE SAIL!&#xD;
" CRAcK on ! master, crack on !" cried 'the impetuous young commander of the&#xD;
-1arpy to his sailing-master as he paced the quarter-deck, and gazed anxiously&#xD;
around the horizon before them ; for the sea opened to infinity on one hand ; but'&#xD;
the white cliffs of England lay yet on the larboard bow. " Crack on'! more sail!&#xD;
Hew beautifully she behaves herself, -from eight up to ten knots! Crack on ! and&#xD;
a fresh pull at the braces; there."&#xD;
They had rounded Cornwall, had anchored in Harnoaze, and were 'out now to&#xD;
join the Channel fleet-for the French were out, too-and there was to be a trial&#xD;
of strength ; and though'the Harpy on this occasion; was playing the part of an&#xD;
aide-de-camp, so to speak, it was, fondly hoped, they might pick up sohe French&#xD;
gun-brig, some corvette, 'some frigate, with whom they might have a "brush," as-&#xD;
the old "salts," the "smell powder,"' the tarry ",bull-dogs"-- almost Harpy born&#xD;
-would term a sea-fight.&#xD;
'Edward, who had been stationed in the fore-part of the ship, made himself as&#xD;
much at home as he could among his new comrades ; and his frank good temper,&#xD;
added to the general disposal of his allowance of grog among 'his' messmates, ob-&#xD;
tained him speedily a number of friends, each of whom vied with the other in&#xD;
teaching the landsmen the duties and technicalities of their profession : and this'&#xD;
they did:the more readily that he showed a desire to learn, and a tractable but'&#xD;
bold disposition, which latter quality they admired the more. To this was added'&#xD;
the patronage of Jack Pipes, onwhom all looked with respect and deference,; ow-&#xD;
ing to his seaman-like qualities, his long experience, themany battles in which he&#xD;
had fought, the storms and tempests he had braved, and the wrecks he had' more&#xD;
than once escaped..-&#xD;
'The men, too, were far above the common class who were so often drafted 'iti&#xD;
these vessels-men of no character, thieves, drunkards,' nd even felons. e The&#xD;
crew of the Harpy were a. picked :lot, and their captain was proud of them --.&#xD;
Good character was a recommendation even to a pressed-man : and when thie first&#xD;
hardships were over, Edward, whose hopes began to revive (he hall not yet been&#xD;
&#xD;
in battle, nor storm, nor did he hear much of the horrors of a French prison,)&#xD;
sought in every way to adapt -himself to ,circumstances : and if the cruise was to&#xD;
be short, why there were chances in his' favor ; and so he submitted to that dis-&#xD;
cipline it had been worse than useless to rebel against, for .to it was added the&#xD;
power over freedom and limb, over life ind death. And so dreaming of his sweet&#xD;
Rose, thinking of his home and parents tenderly, and of his brother Charles often&#xD;
with anxiety, he was borne along in the beautiful craft, with his gay and reckless&#xD;
companions-borne he knew not whither, nor for what destiny.&#xD;
There existed-a singular anomaly between the two services-the army and the&#xD;
navy. In the former, service ,was not compulsory till, the man, of his free-will,&#xD;
took the shilling and the oath; and,:in spite of the flowery and delusive' pictures&#xD;
of the recruiting sergeant, the majority knew well enough its hardships and suf-&#xD;
ferings. While this was free, its tyranny and cruel treatment were of the most&#xD;
wantonly flagrant kid. To flogy to imprison, or to shoot, were, especially in -the&#xD;
former, matters of common, hourly o urrence, and the soldier's 'llfe was rendered&#xD;
unbearable ?' ivlile, on the other hand, !f the naval -service was compulsory, and&#xD;
men were dragged from their homes,- their treatment, exceptunder- very exception-&#xD;
al circumstances, was infinitely better. There was little flogging (in comparison,) '&#xD;
or putting in irons, or hanging, except for direct mutiny or desertion. 'The, fam&#xD;
tigues' of'marching, bivouacking, of enduring hunger and -thirst, and heat and cld,&#xD;
wet and drought, were not-known'; though' some martinets in the naval service&#xD;
tortured their ien with horrors of unnecessary exercise in shortening and making&#xD;
sail, and so on. But the sea-service was largely popular ; and the love of change,&#xD;
and of adventure, so natural to nan, might be one reason; but the great differ-&#xD;
ence in treatment on the whole' must have been the 'chief one. This 'cannot&#xD;
soften down the dreadful pictures at home of ruinedhearths, widowed women, des-&#xD;
titute orphans, poverty, and wretchedness attendant. Those things were patent&#xD;
enough, and all the mechanical beauty of the Harpy or a whole fleet of battle-ships,&#xD;
cannot diminish the fact. But 'to return.&#xD;
" There's mischief in the captain's eye, my lads," said a grim, scarred veteran to&#xD;
his mates around the windlass, as he' folded his arms across his broad chest. 'The&#xD;
fighting gear of the Harpy is not put out for nothing ; nor have the boarding-&#xD;
traps been overhauled for the purpose of picking your teeth with the pikes."&#xD;
"She is a real galley-nipper, this little craft," added a topman, who had just&#xD;
come from aloft. " The master-at-arms is overhauling the arm-chests yonder'; and&#xD;
old Tempest, the boatswain, is below, looking up his active lumber. The gunner&#xD;
is freshening up his spunyarn, to make linstocks ; and there's the armorer with&#xD;
his mates at the grindstone, sharpening up cutlasses. It will soon be,' 'Stand by&#xD;
your guns!' I can tell-"&#xD;
"Right, boy," said Pipes. "I smell powder 'already !" and the men laughed.&#xD;
"I wonder if we.shall overhaul the Channel' fleet to-night," remarked a sailor,&#xD;
who had, with a keen eye, bee gazing over the waste of foam that moaned and&#xD;
hissed in the coming distance.&#xD;
"f she makes-such long legs as she does,-and on this tack she's a regular&#xD;
witch to walk, I can tell you.--we shall come up to them hand over fist," replied&#xD;
a topman. "They say she makes elevenknots and more.&#xD;
"I 'spects as how we're a-taking out papers to the admiral," surmised another,&#xD;
who was considered as a sort of sea-lawyer, who generally guessed wrongly, how-&#xD;
ever, and whose imagination was very vivid.&#xD;
"That's to tell him, from the long-shore nobs, how to ,trim the ship, and lick the&#xD;
doe, I s'pose. Much they know about it, and a pretty bobbery they'd kick up if the&#xD;
lords c'missioners were obligated to sit over the powder magazine, while the red-&#xD;
hot shot was walking slap through her timbers," replied Pipes, scornfully---&#xD;
" Halloa! the leaf'nant speaks."&#xD;
" Give a pull at those weather-braces forrad !" was thundered through the speak-&#xD;
ing-trumpet; and a dozen ready hands immediately obeyed.&#xD;
"JHow do you feel about this, mate ?" asked Pipes, as he walked up to Edward,&#xD;

who was gazing wistfully at.the fading shores ; while the speed of the brig, by a&#xD;
skillful shifting of the helm, was sensibly increased, and she tore on like a dol-&#xD;
phin.&#xD;
"I scarcely know how I feel," replied Edward. "I don't think I am a coward ;&#xD;
bnt I confess I feel a terrible sinking of the heart when I, think that - soon this&#xD;
beautiful fabric more like .a holiday plaything than an armament ofwar may be&#xD;
dealing out death and destruction upon unoftiending men -"&#xD;
" Avast thire !" broke in Pipes: " as for-unoffending, I don't see that drift .so&#xD;
leafly; The French are our nat'ral{horn enemies," he added,, with all the blind&#xD;
prejudice of a seaman of the "old school ;", "and though it's hard lines enough to&#xD;
reckon up a, poor fellow's reckoning with shot or steel, it comes -to this,-we&#xD;
must kill or be killed; and I've no wish to see the inside of a French prison-.-"&#xD;
"Nor they an English one,.:I suspect." said Edward..&#xD;
" And for that reason," replied Pipes, gravely; "when we do come into action,&#xD;
the Lord ha',mercy on us all,+and, that's my total cdf the reckoning,-for there&#xD;
-  'ill be the most 'farnal tussle a ever you seed ;= and so throw all that overboard.-&#xD;
You fights for 'England, home, and beauty;' as the song says.",&#xD;
"I shall fight against my will," returned Edward ; " but what must be, must,&#xD;
and it is very useless to argue the question."&#xD;
Jack Pipes gave a nod confirmatory ofthis opinion, and coolly said to himself,&#xD;
as he walked across the deck,"If that young fellow flinches nuder the first fire,&#xD;
he will eat it the next broadside ; for as quiet as he is--or I'm no judge-..&#xD;
Howeve-, there's no telling ! Thunder and lightning ! how she does race away !"&#xD;
This was said as the:Harpy,- with a tremendous bound, consequent on a slight&#xD;
alteration of the wheel, met an enormous sea, which would have pooped her, had&#xD;
she not as if by instinct, lifted, up herbows and dashed like a pugilist into. his ad-&#xD;
versary; cleft it in two, and, plunging into the pathway thus made, glided between&#xD;
two green nioutitains of water,'that went seething past,. only to unite again at the&#xD;
stern, and to gather their forces for an assault upon some vessel less able to resist.&#xD;
It was this position, quite unexpected, that lifted her to an angle of forty degrees,&#xD;
that disarranged even the " sea-legs" of the most experienced ; for the warning&#xD;
cry of the officer to " Hold on everything !" came at the moment that .Pipes was&#xD;
rolling in the watery scuppers, and half-a-dozen hands were penned together in a&#xD;
coinper at her bows.&#xD;
The cook rushed on deck to see if the brig was tumbling overboard, and lament-&#xD;
ing the loss of sundry articles of crockery .that were "expended" in compound&#xD;
fractures about the floor of his sanctum ; and sundry bumps suffered by those be-&#xD;
"   low, followed by a few direful polyglot oaths, told that the wind was freshening&#xD;
and the sea rising.=&#xD;
The sun set redly, and the clouds gathered their forces, and there was every in-&#xD;
dication of a gale; but not a-tack was started,, not a reef taken, not a sail short-&#xD;
ened. On, on went the Harpy, fierce, glad, and gay ; and when the watches were&#xD;
changed, and the gale was fresh, when the wearied ones sought sleep, shaking their&#xD;
heads in the expectation of being called up,'she still sailed on with all set, and the&#xD;
darkness which, fell;over the ocean was only broken by the light of the battle laa-&#xD;
terns, which herecand there illuminated the deck.&#xD;
&#xD;
c&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
CN1APTER XIV&#xD;
THE ENGAGE ME-NT..&#xD;
Ean fext morning dawnel,the gale had not increased, but Edward saw that&#xD;
during his absence from.deck some of the lighter sail -had been furled ; but these&#xD;
were again shaken out, and as the Harpy was steering in another tack, her speed&#xD;
was not so great. Evidently, sle was yin the, neighborhood of the ground- she was&#xD;
estined for.&#xD;
The captain. and his officers were oti the quarter-deck, and an earnest .consulta-&#xD;
tion was held among them. Edward with his mates were at their posts; and a si-&#xD;
lence reigned;among the men, broken only by whispers. Was something import-&#xD;
ant going to happen? IYid they expect the enemy ?&#xD;
A voiceas from the clouds reached the deck. " sail ho 1" 'it- cried in a clear&#xD;
tone, which came distinctly to -every ear. This was from a man stationed in the&#xD;
fore-top.&#xD;
" Where away ?" demanded the captain from the deck.&#xD;
6dut onpthe. weather-quarter, your honor !" was the reply. "The'e's a light&#xD;
scud just lifting over It."&#xD;
The captain was peering through, his glass in the direction indicated, but was&#xD;
unable tonakethlie saii out. He lifted up, his head :towards the mast, and said]&#xD;
".Can you; make out  the rig ?"&#xD;
"'Tis a 'renchman, your ",qIr !", returned the man, " by the out of the sails&#xD;
and the trim of the yards., Si's under easy canvass, and, a frigate chock fullof&#xD;
teeth. .A pleased; murmur arose from 'all.&#xD;
".Al1 hands mpkg 'sail!" was the cry, and.then followed directions for turning&#xD;
the head of the Harpy inthat direction, which a few minutes served to do. This&#xD;
was in her favorite sailing point, and she did not belie her reputation, nor the ex-&#xD;
pectation of those on board.&#xD;
"'Fore George !" said the captain, his glass to his eye, "She begins to lift up&#xD;
now, and the fellow is quite right Beat to qurarters !"&#xD;
Thisshort, sharp, and decisive command was followed by the whistle of the&#xD;
boatswaim arid the roll of the drum. Without another word of command being&#xD;
needed,,each captin of the gun, with his ien, were at their posts in a'thrice ; and&#xD;
the apparent confusion of 'an instant was followed by a pause, order, and stillness,&#xD;
when very man and boy on board was.at his allotted place.&#xD;
Orders were now given to clear the decks, to knock in the bulkheads, to open&#xD;
the magazine, and to take the arns that were ranged round the masts. The board-&#xD;
ing settings were up, the cannon-balls piled in their" places, sponges' and' ramrods&#xD;
handled; guns loaded, and the linstock lighted ready for ,the:work.&#xD;
" Six-and-twentyteeth, said the sailing-master ; "and the 'fellow is stopping&#xD;
his ship for work like a man. Shaht I get the yards slung; your honor ?"&#xD;
"Yes," replied the captain; and bear a hand about it, too, for he- seems to&#xD;

corps, "and fill the tops. Ready fore and aft!"-&#xD;
"Aye, aye, sir !" was .the ready but;subdued response.&#xD;
The Harpy was still sailing,,but' her handsome;eterior was becoming very&#xD;
menacing. The sails were furled, the lower yard slang, and every preparation was&#xD;
made to pounce upon the victim."&#xD;
" Doctor, to your post," ordered the captain ; and the person indicated.descended&#xD;
into the cockpit; where, his assistants, with their open i6hests, were already waiting.&#xD;
In the meantime the stranger had laid his sails flat,:'and theh furled them. f As the&#xD;

A gun from the frigate was heard booming on the water.&#xD;
" He's asking us to surrender, I think," said the captain, with a scornful smile,&#xD;
as he grasped a heavy sword, and put his pistols in his belt. " Steady, my men,"&#xD;
he continued ; " you see your-Work, and I expect'fbu'll do it. Let them hear us&#xD;
speak. Fire a gun forward there" .Bang it went : and itnow became a strug-&#xD;
gle for the"weather-gage&#xD;
"Fire at the first flash," said the captain; and then silence deep as death reign-&#xD;
ed throughout the -brig.&#xD;
Edward was stationed on the forecastle, at a gun over which Jack Pipes was&#xD;
captain, and was armed like the rest with pistols and cutlass, his boarding-pike'&#xD;
within reach-for the guns must be worked first-and,"either to board or to resist,&#xD;
the pike'was a most effective weapon. "&#xD;
The men had flung their jackets off, for the most part, and had on only their&#xD;
shirts and trousers. The slippers were kicked off and cast below, and with no in-&#xD;
cumbrance they-waited for the first deadly sign. Every gun had its man, with a&#xD;
lighted match ready,.the latter stooping down with his eye on the-Frenchman. The'&#xD;
flash came.&#xD;
"Fire !"  God, what a roar ! what , a deafening, horrible clangor ! What&#xD;
crashing followed, and what frightful shrieks ! The fight was begun. Some bleed-,&#xD;
ing forms already lay on the decks.. Some lives were already gone. Both vessels'&#xD;
now fired broadside after broadside ; and the wind fell; till the sails' hung as in' a&#xD;
calm. The faces of the men became dark with bldd and powder ; their counte..&#xD;
nance grew fierce and savage. The thunderous discharges hurtled and crashed,'&#xD;
and the crew of each gun worked away like so riauiyends.&#xD;
The Harpy was in hertglory. She was rejoicing, "even as her fine'rigging was&#xD;
cut, her white sails burnt and torn ; as her spars" were snapped, her bulwarks&#xD;
smashed, her sides riddled, her men bathing het decks with blood' in that fierce&#xD;
baptism of fire. Fast and sharp did broadside follow broadside, and nearer and.&#xD;
nearer came the vessels together.&#xD;
" In the tops there !" shouted the captain.&#xD;
" Aye, aye, sir," replied the ready voices.&#xD;
" Stand by with your grapnels !" he cried again. "If he means to embrace us,'&#xD;
we 'will help him to hold. 'Bear a hand with that tackle on the fore-yard-arm.-,&#xD;
One of the slings is disabled. Master, look to It.'&#xD;
G" A ye, aye, sir !"  And through smoke and fire, and the furious cannonading&#xD;
that ceased not for -an instant-a cannonading that swept the decks of both, and&#xD;
broke and battered the hull and bulwark, and tore away masts and stays--by mu-&#xD;
tual consent they laid themselves together in order to commit as much havoc as&#xD;
possible, and then, with one wild and frenzied cheer from those of the combatants'&#xD;
left, sink into the depths of their ocean tombs.&#xD;
"Stand by, to repel boarders !" shouted the captain, springing into the rigging,&#xD;
sword iti hand. " Stand by' on the starboard quarter !" and a body of men, armed'&#xD;
to the teeth, rushed, at the order, to the post they were directed to with loud cries,&#xD;
of defiance..&#xD;
" Give it thom- my lads ! One broadside more," continued the captain, waving'&#xD;
his sword, "and they will be alongside, morecrippled than they expect."  The&#xD;
broadside roared, and fresh shrieks arose.&#xD;
" Where's the master ?" demanded the captain, hurriedly, looking round him.'&#xD;
"Here, sir ! -here your honor !" shouted' the master, in reply..&#xD;
He was clinging to a stay, with his foot on a splinter of a mainmast, nailing the'&#xD;
colors, which had been shot from the ensign halyards,0to it; This done, he slid&#xD;
down on deck,&#xD;
" Bravely done, old friend !" said the captan : " it's wai-m work."&#xD;
" Man the gangways-! Stand by there, boa~rdei-a !" shouted the master, suddenly&#xD;
He was grim as TYulcan, but cool and collected, in casting an eye to the 'injuries&#xD;
&#xD;
masts, sails, and 'rigging .received. "Man the gangways; .for he's coming down&#xD;
upon us."&#xD;
"We are ready for him. Keep your fire alive,,my men. There goes, the last'&#xD;
of'his sticks over the side !'&#xD;
"I am thinking, your honor, if this shaving' goes on a little longer, .as we'll&#xD;
both be a pair"of sheer hulks," observed the ,master,-with a laugh, as a terrific&#xD;
broadside with more fatal effect, swept the deck with its witheringareath.&#xD;
"Heave 'the' grapuels ! heave !" -cried the captain. "So, well swung ! '-He's&#xD;
going to board us1' His deck swarms with men! ,, Down from the tops-down&#xD;
all!" and instantly-the tops:were deserted, and the men clustered' forward, as the&#xD;
deck of the Frenchman was visible to them, full of; men, dead and . wounded, and&#xD;
covered with ruinous confusion.&#xD;
'"Away there, boarders !" 'shouted the Commander., ".Clear the decks of-them !"&#xD;
And as'fifty or sixty men leaped from the Frenchman,:andcut through the netting,&#xD;
and clambered' where they 'could, the, "bull-dogs," of the' murderous: Harpy,&#xD;
with pike and cutlass; thrust or cut them down ;! and those who were :not driven&#xD;
back on-their own decks, fell:into the sea.; The strife was now more .desperate&#xD;
than ever. The great guns were silent, and shot and steel'did the rest of the san-&#xD;
guinary and unnatural work.&#xD;
" Stand by to board !" shouted the captain after this advantage springing to&#xD;
his own forecastle. "Norris!" he called to his lieutenant, "Board on the quar-&#xD;
ter. Make headway amidships. Give a pull on the grapnels, and, my lads, and&#xD;
the Frenchman is your own. There's-;no going back now ;" and while the men,&#xD;
with ready hand, seized on the slack of the grapnels, which had got entangled in&#xD;
the rigging of the foe, the two vessels were .now chafing their sides against each&#xD;
other, and the slaughter grew greater.&#xD;
The state of the fight was now reversed, and the English,, instead of; defending&#xD;
their decks, - were in turn, theassailants,, having made good their footing on&#xD;
the decks of' the foe, pouring over the side a cataract of steel and shot, and hunyan&#xD;
beings, eager, savage, arid merciless, were stabbing, shooting, killing, neither giv-&#xD;
ing nor asking for quarter.&#xD;
The musketry of the-larpy's marines here assisted them, though the withering&#xD;
fire of the Frenchman had decimated the numbers of the former;' and ,the strife&#xD;
on the deck was'sickening in the intense fury withwhich it raged. , The deeks&#xD;
were slippery with gore, the scuppers ran with blood, and the wounded, mingled&#xD;
with' the slain,'died 'with shouts of "Vive 1' Empereur! '' and " God save the king I&#xD;
for it had now become impossible:to remove the wounded away.&#xD;
In the waist of the French' frigate, the .two bodies met.; and,,as the English&#xD;
sailors were leaping down, a couple of carronades from the .quarter-deck were&#xD;
fired with such'effect,.that for a mpoment:it was thought, that-every man was killed,&#xD;
and the fore-part of the 'ship itself riddled like a seive.. This was a Mistake ; for&#xD;
instantly after,:a deafening cheer arose, and .loud above, the din was heard the voice&#xD;
of the captain shouting,, "Ahoy !,'there, you Harpys, forward I Weave ahead, sea-&#xD;
dogs?  Show them your teeth, and let them, feel your bite !"&#xD;
The cheers redoubled. The infernal din increased. 'The. sharp crack of pistol&#xD;
shot-the oath-the -blow-the sound of the,;cloven skull, and the fall of the body&#xD;
on the deck,,assisted the diabolical .melee.- Still more ;of the Harpy's crew capre&#xD;
tumbling over the side ; 'and though ths Frenchmen fought with the' most dp&#xD;
termined courage, they gave. way insensibly before the furipusardor they encoun-&#xD;
tered.&#xD;
The French captain-foremost in the battle, and seen everywhre--seemed to&#xD;
be struggeling to meet the captain of the Harpy. Fierce,, and yet 'calm in his&#xD;
orders, he rallied his men around him, and the fortune of the fight; as yet sus-&#xD;
pended in the ballance when both the chiefs met, and thenext moment were joined&#xD;
in fierce conflict.&#xD;
:Jack Pipes had been severely wounded and struck down. just as .hs leaped on&#xD;
the desk, and his life Was not worth ane minute's purchase, when FEdward, who had&#xD;

AFTER Rose had!etpirued and detailed to Edward's family all she had done,-&#xD;
tieir parting, his lit messages, -and so-oil,-the'first (stupifying pang of grief gave&#xD;
why before those hopes, which human nature, iii its vacillation and its. re-action,&#xD;
will cherish in spite of all: and pearly a weekhad elapsed since Edward' was first&#xD;
taken away from them, wile by little and little, Martin and his :'wife recovered&#xD;
their tranquillity, but i-edoubled; if-possible, their love for Charles ; while -Rose,&#xD;
anxious to second whas  efned likely to be productive Of some good, went cheer-&#xD;
fullya"bout her hdusehol 'duties,: and thought 'how' she could best serve Charles&#xD;
'utsCharye     coding, thoughtful, and melancholy -was, clearly to all, an al-&#xD;
tered creature. lfe went to his labor as usual, but not to work ; and, he would&#xD;
uitw it to take long walks in the relds, carefully avoiding the quiet lahe-and shady&#xD;
beeches, whichremihded him of so much that he had lost. By turns the image&#xD;
of Ellei; with'her face of-f fascination, would appear to hitn, and anon the loss of&#xD;
his brother totallyilestroyed the ordl strength- which he possessed. With all&#xD;
his'good' sens; and With  lknowledge'of the necessity of submission, this weighed&#xD;
upon 'him like a tesistless fate. - How it was he knew not. He :felt it to be sot&#xD;
and he. could not shake off 'the, strange and depitessing shadow of a nameless fear&#xD;
that weighed'.o heavily upon him.'&#xD;
One afternoon'he was returning home from a long 'ramble, depressed-and inelan-&#xD;
dhdlly beyond endurar ee. - His fancy had 'taken a lond flight into the mo-e bliss-&#xD;
ful days' of the past, 'andlis-heart was heavy with tfie very weight of a tender.&#xD;
hess whose sensation' wai a compound of- pleasire" and anguish. There was- a&#xD;
soft and enervating stillness all around him. Gray towers, slumbering in the sum-&#xD;
bier air, cotitrasted With the lazy and luxurious nodding of the trees, whose&#xD;
branches softly sahg a gentle tune, to which rivulets flowing across the meadows&#xD;
forined an accompaniment. The birds"were singing in the hedges, and the " hums&#xD;
of. the giasshlipei' Was heard front the waving'grass. It was the time, the place,&#xD;
where young lovers mi ht 'meet and tell the secrets of each othei's hearts, and&#xD;
Oharles felt the inihen'6 tie i&amp;amp;scene catryiiighirai back to'the blissful hours when&#xD;

&#xD;
beautiful, and gifted a creature, should harden herself against the holiest impulses&#xD;
of humanity, and out of an execrable pride borrow an armor which went far to&#xD;
convert the woman into somethingoless than human. With a heart like hers, why&#xD;
should its wells'grow arid=?-with loveliness.,like hers, why should it be withered&#xD;
in the dthrnace' ofrher 'haughty passions ?  If she was not a highborn lady, the&#xD;
same-feelings;,with their cause and efiect,-hold good in the humble peasant girl;&#xD;
and this:is.why I am.so minute indetailing the anatomy of this antagonism be-&#xD;
tween them, which asingle breath might have blown away.&#xD;
She etfoughtthe looked. haggard,'and worn,.and anxious. Her heart beat at&#xD;
this, because sheknew-it' was all for her sake:that his fine eyes were dulled. "'Oh,."&#xD;
she thought, "if he would but speak !". At the instant a manly voice called -out&#xD;
Ellen ;" and:    n' ,.with a handful of wild field aid hedge flowers, came -up&#xD;
the path. He was a soldier---an officer ; a tall, handsome man of some six, or&#xD;
eight-andthirty, sun-burnt and- scari-ed, but erect in bearing, bold, and stately.-&#xD;
'The undress' uniform, the;sword,-sash, and cap added to his fine person a' sort of&#xD;
picturesque.grace which the :quick and jealous glance of Charles instantly wit-&#xD;
nessed;.and as a matter of course, whatever had been generous in his thoughts a&#xD;
moment ago, gave way.&#xD;
The- officer came up to the'stile; and gave a slight start at seeing the sombre&#xD;
youthful face on the other side it. With a smile, he said; "Now, my friend, per-&#xD;
mit us to pass you;" just as if he had been speaking to any common creature,&#xD;
and not her lovers and his rival (as Oharles thought.) Hemoved slightly aside.&#xD;
There was:such an' imploring agony-in themute look which Charles lifted up to&#xD;
her face, thatagain she wavered and shook : but Charles noticed,: or .fancied he&#xD;
did, that her glance-wandered, with a supercilious air that bit deep into his soul,&#xD;
from his own.well-formed:but simply-clad person to the' faultless exterior of the&#xD;
dashing officer. TheJatter leaped lightly over, and with his powerful arms lifted&#xD;
Ellen off and placed her on the 'path, within a foot of Charles.&#xD;
"Good -good---evening, Mr. Palmer," she said,.hesitating.&#xD;
"What 'ldo you know this ,young rustic, then ?" demanded the officer gaily, and&#xD;
a rapid-glance was passed from the one to the other as some discrepancy struck&#xD;
him. a&#xD;
"Good -evening-eMiss," said Charles faintly, and his frame "quivered from&#xD;
head to foot. This, thei---and:Charles eyed the officer-this, they, was her part-&#xD;
ner at the ball-the attraction that drew her to -Liverpool-this, then, was his&#xD;
successful: rival!  s&#xD;
" Why, zounds ! what's the meaning of these lackadaisical looks and tones ?"&#xD;
said the officer,-witha laugh.. "Have we had a lover in the case?  Does the&#xD;
gay , the beautiful Miss Freshville encourage the admiration of clowns, too, what-&#xD;

A red spot=mounted to the cheeks of Charles at the word " Clown."  It left&#xD;
them again as:the fondand-familiar expression, "My dear,""followed.&#xD;
"Oh, no," she"replied with- a laugh that thrilled through him with the effect of&#xD;
a,mortalbblow--and that laugh otherwise so melodious, was like that of a hyena.&#xD;
" Oh, no," she said, " he is only, the son of a neighbor-that's ' all. Good eve-&#xD;
ning !"-.and she turned to him with all the courage she could pluck up, and truth&#xD;
to say,-poor Ellen was in no little embarrassment as well as pain.&#xD;
"That's-all,!" murmured Charles, as- he stood with pale and livid face before&#xD;
them both, the officer puzzled, yet laughing, and then cheelping himself as he saw&#xD;
the dreadfullybpale face of -the- poor lad, who, withhis hat off hanging listlessly in&#xD;
his hand, which he had removed for air to cool his throbbing forehead, looked like&#xD;
the hero of;some tragic-comedy.!-&#xD;
."-:1think.this is a serious matter, upon -my faith," said the officer. " What does&#xD;
it mean; Ellen.?"&#xD;
- "Depend -upon it," -she-rreplied, " It's i-thing-is it, Charles ?" and she turned&#xD;
:to him.- H~e-fancied that- -she 'was not so collected as she desired to have it&#xD;

her words after her. " It is-nothing-nothing! Nothing now, nor ever will&#xD;
be-&#xD;
, "My good fellow !" said the officer, "explain yourself." -&#xD;
"God protect'your Ellen;j' said Charles,- wildly ; 4and may you be to"another&#xD;
what you have not been- to me:.-Farewell! - I' will crossfyour path no more !" and&#xD;
with a bound he:cleared the- stile:and hurried away.&#xD;
" Indeed, I think' it will be better so,"'the officer observed to her as he went on,&#xD;
while the ghastly smile on her lips, and the -horrible faintness at her heart, proved&#xD;
that she sustained herself only by a heroism that would be great in a better cause.&#xD;
" I think so, too," he said. " I'll tell you what it is, my, pretty niece, you must&#xD;
not smile too kindly on these poor lads.' 'Your beauty will drive them crazy, and&#xD;
a smile or s a nod finishes the work. But come, let us complete-our-walk; to-night,&#xD;
you know, I must join my regiment, which to-morrow is on the march.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
CAUGHT AT LAST.&#xD;
IF Charles had been pursued by a fiend,-haunted by one of those fabulous&#xD;
creatures, who, half woman aid half serpent, lure men by their supernal loveli-&#xD;
ness, and win their soul and body, and then disclose all their horrors,"as they de-&#xD;
stroy the victim they have secured, and unfold the hideous folds of their demoniac&#xD;
forms, till maddened- with terror, the great gulf of everlasting death opens broadly&#xD;
to the eye of the soul,-if he had been; listening to' the song of such a syren; and&#xD;
was fiCeing from the glimpse he -had caught of the evil nature to which this fascin-&#xD;
ation had been bound, he could not have hurried -away with a more tremendous&#xD;
dread than=he"did then.&#xD;
° ' That 'he 'had parted from-her once and forever, in the full and implicit belief&#xD;
that she=knew him not-valuedhim not-and loved: him not a whit, but rather&#xD;
played -and trifled with hini, was' perfectly true. 'He admitted it'  to himself ; but&#xD;
he had not calculated on her obtaining so crushing a triumph over him; It was a&#xD;
humiliation that abased him to the lowest depths of misery, and to 'meet her again&#xD;
after that second parting, was what, in this life, he promised himself could not be.&#xD;
The topmost Alps were not farther removed from the lowest depths of the ocean&#xD;
than he was parted from: her. Let her go, the heartless one, till, some day, the&#xD;
penalty of her falsehood would burn into her ,heart like fire, and let him' go where&#xD;
he would be beyond all chance of crossing her path. Better be ' with the dead&#xD;
than here. Better be ih danger and peril with' his brother than here. Yes ! he&#xD;
would go! He would so effectually break the link this time, that all 'the powers&#xD;
of the'universe should never- lnitd it again.&#xD;
She was happy, too-happy in her way ! He laughed- with a fierce bitterness,&#xD;
as he' thought-heaven;forgive him !-that her light and wanton conduct would&#xD;
lead her at last to, ruin and perdition !  What else, could; come to her ?-&#xD;
What could the coquette expect? :;-What but one conclusion 'was to: be dr wn&#xD;
from all the conditions she 1had created for herself. Alas forther I 'aid alas; too,&#xD;
for him ! He could not but be sorry that so-vast a love ' as his should- go unre-&#xD;
warded--be so :unappreciated.&#xD;
Over field and meadow, green lane and dusty road, he had passed ; and once&#xD;
more he was at Kirkdale. The: thought of the'recruiting sergeant flashed across&#xD;
him, and- the recollection of parents-home-all- were forgotten. Did his ear be-&#xD;
lie hirmi- Did he still hear thie beating of the drum?- Wasthat the shrill fife&#xD;

" Do they send soldiers out of the country by ships ?" asked Charles.&#xD;

the answer.&#xD;

" And if I--if I enlist?" began Charles.&#xD;
"You will be on board the same ship with your brother in a week; and," added&#xD;
the sergeant, sotto voce, "that may or my not be true, but it won't be the less&#xD;
true that you're nailed ; and the devil himself I don't think will be able to un-&#xD;
clench them for you. Now,. then,' he added, aloud, " hold out your hand, and&#xD;
take your cockade."&#xD;
 " The first I will ; the latter-not yet. If you want to settle the matter, and&#xD;
make me your own, you had better let me take the oath at once."&#xD;
"That's true'! ._Odd's i1uskets'- and bayonets !" swore the sergeant,," that's&#xD;
true ; and here we are before the magistrate's; house already. Follow me!"&#xD;
Charles followed his conductor into the office of-the magistrate, where, in com-&#xD;
any with some:other reetuits, the- oath was taken, and the cockade fastened on&#xD;
im., Now Charles belonged no more to himself. He had sold his heritage, his&#xD;
right, his will, his body, for less than a mess of pottage., It required a strong&#xD;
heart now to supporthis 'thoughts ; a little bustle in the-office for a moment dis- -&#xD;
tracted hi  ttention.&#xD;
The oll y jovial sergeant was obtaining a warrant for a deserter, Robert Morris&#xD;
by name, who, two days ago, had.quitted his regiment, and was supposed to have&#xD;
gone back to his mother's house.,&#xD;
Here was another chapter in.the history of human wretchedness for Charles to&#xD;
study. Robert Morris, the son of the widow, hunted out as a deserter !-to be&#xD;
flogged or shot? Doubtless he would know more, for he, miserable fool, was one&#xD;
of the initiated, and might it not:' be his own turn some day of recklessness or&#xD;
other,?&#xD;
Yes-he had witnessed the opening chapter of' that story.   He now be-&#xD;
held the second chapter opening. What would the third and concluding one be&#xD;
like?&#xD;
The warrant was granted with coarse jests and low witticisms : and Charles be-&#xD;
held at once half the veil of the lie rent ,away with which the sergeant had be-&#xD;
guiled his anxiety.:, It is true he 'had himself suggested to him the way in which&#xD;
he was to ,be 'deceived ; but the deceit= was so fai agreeable that he would willingly&#xD;
believe it with all his heart. To join his brother would now be a balm for every&#xD;
suffering. Taking the sergeant aside, he said, "Youdo not deceive me-I shall&#xD;
g on board the Harpy?"&#xD;
" Upon my honor !"' was the answer.&#xD;
"And, if possible, I had rather be off at once to the depot ?"&#xD;
At this moment the 'jolly sergeant, with the warrant, went" forth in order to&#xD;
-hunt. up his victim.&#xD;
"You will be 'a general, sir !"- said 'Kitely. "Damme! I like your pluck. How&#xD;
eager you are to serve his Majesty'!"'&#xD;
As Charles was marched with his comrades on. towards Liverpool, within an&#xD;
hour- after, they passed a corporal and' two soldiers, with muskets 'and fixed bayo-&#xD;
nets on their shoulders. 'Between the two latter walked a haggard, head-bowed&#xD;
man, handcuffed, and clad in tattered garments. 1 A -woman followed behind. It&#xD;
'wasthe deserter ! ' It was the-son of the widow-Robert Morrs ! and the woman&#xD;
that followed was the heart-broken cousin. But of them, more anon.&#xD;

.THE TWIN BROTHERS.,&#xD;
ChAPTER XVIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
ELLEN'S REICO RSE .&#xD;
GREAT was the consternation next day, when after a night spent intenxiety and ter&#xD;
ror, a letter from Liverpool came to the house of the Palmer's, telling -them that&#xD;
(Jharles had taken the irrevocable.step,--had.enlisted,-and by the time they re-&#xD;
ceived it would be far on his way to join his brother. He had left them withorit&#xD;
a word s a farewell, an embrace, a kiss. He had left them for ever I Ungrateful&#xD;
-unkind boy!    ,&#xD;
The anguish of'the:old man 'was like a stroke of paralysis. He wept, but spoke&#xD;
not, stirred not., In the mute apathy of an overwhelming anguish that is too vast&#xD;
for any words to express, he only saw the bleeding artery which had been cut ;&#xD;
and in the cutting of which his two noble, brave lads,-the light of his eye, the&#xD;
pride of his manhood,-were lost to him for ever.&#xD;
It was a sad, harrowing spectacle, to:see the hale man mute in his great sorrow,&#xD;
sitting like an inanimate mass in his easy-chair. - Tears trickled down his venera-&#xD;
ble cheeks, and his trembling hands would:writhe and turn in one another convul-&#xD;
sively every now and. then. A partial imbecility had struck him ; and, for the&#xD;
time, he did not appear-to - recognize any round him. Occasionally the names,&#xD;
"Edward !" "Charles !"- would 'break on his lips, showing that his stricken fancy,&#xD;
in its dementia, clung to them.&#xD;
The aged mother wept, and, like Rachael, mourned for her children ; 'for to her,&#xD;
indeed, they were not ! She could never see them again-never-never-never&#xD;
more. Oh ! the dreadful pain of that .agonized moaning, and the wrinkled hands&#xD;
wringing themselves in the stupendous despair that forgets there is God above all,&#xD;
or that there is a final meeting, even though the parting. here be for ever ! Oh 1&#xD;
the.pain of beholding age dumb and frozen in its grief !-to listen to the broken cry&#xD;
--the exclamation--the prayer-s-the poor broken-spirited, bowed-dowe mother gave&#xD;
vent to !&#xD;
Rose had to endure all without shrieking, fainting, crying, or wringing of her&#xD;
hands. She had been stunned too at the news ; but when she saw the old man&#xD;
sink into {his chair, and heard the poor mother's wailing, her strong heart,&#xD;
though it was strained to cracking too, supported her. A moral courage of the&#xD;
noblest kind came to her. aid and sustained her.'. The sense of duty made her&#xD;
strong, and the charge left on her hands by Charles' sad but affectionate and de-&#xD;
spairing letter, demandedevery energy. She summoned them, and they came.&#xD;
Indignation .sustained her-and her indignation was directed against Ellen&#xD;
Freshville. It was not difficult for her woman's apprehensions to light on the&#xD;
cause of the-poor lad's reckless and miserable resource. She never beheld her own&#xD;
sex placed in so contemptible a position ; for too well assured-that Charles had ,a&#xD;
heart as loyal as it was affectionate, the coquettish .trifling of which}Ellen had been&#xD;
guilty was as clearly at the head of the: offence as it was despicable, and Rose re-&#xD;
solved to see her; and, in feminine parlance, "tell her a bit of her mind.".&#xD;
In the evening she desired a neighboror, two to stay with the old people while&#xD;
she went out awhile, which was done with willing kindness. The doctor had been&#xD;
called in and had left some soothing draughts; but Time only would heal the&#xD;
wound, and cure the sickness of the mind ; and this Rose felt as well as he could&#xD;
tell her.&#xD;
In the evening, therefore, she put on her mantle and hat, and passing rapidly&#xD;
out of the village, crossed the church and madd for the green lane and the beech&#xD;
trees, where she knew Charles had been accustomed to meet Ellen.&#xD;

be told, unless she trusted in one of the numerous chapters of accidents ; nor was&#xD;
she in the wrong,--for charming, but pensive and pale, there Ellen certainly&#xD;
was.&#xD;
They had often been accustomed to meet in the best of friendly terms ; but&#xD;
Ellen had never seen such a light in Rose's.eyetbefore, nor had she remarked such&#xD;
a color on her cheeks.&#xD;
"What have you done to Charles, Ellen ?" demanded Rose, with an abrupthess&#xD;
q,       almost fierce, in reply to Ellen's salutation.&#xD;
"Doneto Charles!" responded 'the haughty beauty, by her coquettish instinct&#xD;
thinking that this was an overture of peace, and deeming that here came the mes-&#xD;
senger to bring her his submission to her feet. "Done to Charles ?" and she gave&#xD;
her head a, toss.'  He has been telling her of our meeting 'last night, she&#xD;
thought.&#xD;
" Yes!" said Roe: "I repeat, what have you done to him ?"&#xD;
" Why, what do you mean by such a strange -question, my- dear ?" said&#xD;
El!n, half laighing. ' What in the world do you think I could have done to&#xD;
him?"r&#xD;
"Ellen !" said Rose, with startling gravity; " this is no. time for airs and aflfe-&#xD;
tation. The question is. far 'too important-too dreadful-"&#xD;
"Dreadful! My God! what do you mean"?" cried Ellen, in affright.&#xD;
"  mean that, if you never cared for him, that 'it can be of no further conse-&#xD;
(        quence tp you,"' continued Rose, bitterly; "for all that might have been done to&#xD;
heal the breach between you comes too late."&#xD;
"-What do you mean, Rose ?" once more demanded Ellen, with blanched&#xD;
cheeks.&#xD;
"And if," continued Rose, remorselessly, " you 'did love him, your affected in-&#xD;
difference, your scorn, your torture of his affectionate heart, has -dhe its work,&#xD;
and he is as much lost to you -as he is to us ; lost without relief. What have you&#xD;
done to him ?, I insist upon'ap answer."&#xD;
"Tell me what this means," 'said Ellen, trembling ; "for I cannot say I under-&#xD;
stand you -.something-dreadful   "---"&#xD;
" We shall never-never see him again, Ellen," said Rose, bursting into tears,&#xD;
and now sobbing unrestrainedly.&#xD;
The deadly pallor-that increased on Ellen's face, and drove every drop of blood&#xD;
out of her cheeks, was awful to behold. She became rigid as stone, and the&#xD;
fires seemed to die away in her beautiful eyes. The change was beyond credi-&#xD;
bility.a                               e  ot&#xD;
"Stop-a moment," she said, in changed voice. " Ler,  e .utiderstand-you&#xD;
-  Let me think--lost 4 'to me-to you!1-to all!=-Never se       u-him-&#xD;
more&amp;amp;--" 'She kept, repeating with her white trembling lips. " Rose, for&#xD;
pitf's sake, do not torture me, but speak plainly at once.",.&#xD;
" Did you love Charles or did you not ?" asked Rose emphatically. " This is&#xD;
not the moment to trifle, not the time to hesitate, not the instant to deceive your-&#xD;
self or me. Did you love him, Ellen ?"'&#xD;
"I-did !" replied Ellen, in a thrilling whisper.&#xD;
"Unhappy, foolish, mad girl !" exclaimed Rose ; "then you have, in your&#xD;
wretched use of your beauty, sealed your own unhappiness and wrought your own&#xD;
punishment."&#xD;
"I loved him as I loved my soul, Rose !" cried Ellen, in a voice broken with&#xD;
intensity. " I' loved him so utterly, that till this moment I never knew how&#xD;
deeply; and now words-words will never, never tell how. great was my love.&#xD;
And now-now that I have told you all, confessed all, and would give anything to&#xD;
have him here to tell him sc, let me know the worst !"&#xD;
" The worst is, Ellen, th it he last night enlisted-that he last night left this&#xD;
place without returning home-that by this time he is far on his journey, never&#xD;
perhaps to return."'&#xD;
" Gone 1-left me t-enlisted !" shrieked Ellen. " Rose, do you want me to fh&#xD;

'I saw him-and. I spoke to him; but I saw him with averted eyes, I spoke&#xD;
to him-with a changed voice, I disguised my looks, and hid my heart from him ;&#xD;
and now- --"- and Ellen, sinking on the grass, pressed her hand upon her fore.&#xD;
head, and burst into a fresh shower of hot tears, heedless now of 'll Rose could&#xD;
.Say.,&#xD;
I siall aie!'I shall die, Rose ! I loved,'I worshipped him! 'I shall go mad!'&#xD;
His father-his mother will curse me.!- Oh, heaven !-Oh, heaven,! what-what&#xD;
shall I do?  How can I meet them ? What is to be done?   Rose, dear,.good&#xD;
Rose, ie my friend, and help me in this trial."&#xD;
" I know not," said Rose, "unless your father has friends and influence. ~We,"'&#xD;
she added,'sorrowfully, -" have, none ; and 'both Edward and Charles are gone,&#xD;
and only myself, helpless and alone, left to the old people?"&#xD;
"My father I",murmured Rose. " Influence !-and-what did you say?&#xD;
Well, we sh l1 see,! Come with me, Rose, comer with me ;" and she hurriedly&#xD;
rose up, dragging the young girl by the hand.&#xD;
"Wh     are y  going?" asked Rose.&#xD;
" To kneel at their fee-toaask-their pardpro for-having been so_-wicked., To&#xD;
beg their prayer and blessing. If I cannotetfect his release, he shall feel that I&#xD;

" But, Ellen-" began Rose.&#xD;
" What?" said, Ellen.&#xD;
" Who knows what may be his fate?  It may be too late'!"&#xD;
Let us pray to God- to avert the evil," replied Ellen.&#xD;
That night,after a scene of great and hear-rending anguish, Ellen aftei- having&#xD;
obtained the forgiveness-a,nd the blessing of the old people,.and taken a more than&#xD;
ordinarily affectionate leave for the night of, her father; on her ,return home and&#xD;

CHAPTER      XVIII.&#xD;
THE DESERTER.&#xD;
IN spite of summer weather, the evening winds grew gusty, clouds gathered i10&#xD;
the north-east, and the air grewchill and sombre, as the night deepened over-head.&#xD;
The -heavy sighing of the breeze was indescribably mournful, and accorded well&#xD;
with the sorrow of those who thought at home of' those far' away.&#xD;
Dane Morris was seated by her lonely fireside, with her head bent over her&#xD;
bosom, and her haids clasped together on her knees." On those knees had she,&#xD;
many a time and oft, nursed and' dandled the poor lad, who, in the infatuation of&#xD;
the hour, had surrendered himself to the temptation which had borne him away to&#xD;
the dreary bondage of a soldier's life.&#xD;
'Jane sat opposite to her, and the same gloom had infected her. She had grown&#xD;
paler, thinner, and sadder. The blight had fallen upon that little household, and&#xD;
there was no avenue by which any cheering ray could come near to them more.&#xD;
Half of what had made life lovely and attractive was gone. The youth of her&#xD;
heart was torn away. The support of the household was gone. In addition to&#xD;
the pangs of bereavement, they had to sustain the greater' one, if possible, of pen-&#xD;
ury. There were three little innocents sleeping in their humble beds. What had&#xD;
the future for them 'but beggary or crime?&#xD;
It was with this phase of sorrow that the mind of the mother was engaged. It&#xD;
was in tracing the lines of this hideous portraiture that her maternal heart was&#xD;
throbbingly following the frightful labyrinth ; to the streets, to the workhouse, or&#xD;
to the prison. What else, in their helplessness, could they expect?&#xD;
'he She had applied to Mr. Freshville, and the stern and arid old man had told her&#xD;
he could do nothing; that her son was a fool, and a "do-no-good."  The King&#xD;
wanted men. Roburt' had redeemed half his errors by becoming a'soldier ; so the&#xD;
old man said. It was useless to apply. She must submit, and make the best of,&#xD;
the bad : and, as for him, he had nothing, to do with the matter.' He did not&#xD;
think how soon he would have to mourn for his own loss. He had no idea that&#xD;
he should soon be tearing his own white'hairs, and lamenting the loss of his beau-&#xD;
ti}ful daughter, who told him, iii a hasty note that she had gone to seek her soldier,&#xD;
and to join her fate to his, whatever that fate might be.&#xD;
A nd the widow mourned. It was a very da!,k bleak, sorrowful world for her,&#xD;
poor soul, now; and Jane could offer no consolation, as she wanted it greatly her-&#xD;
The solemn winds, to the poor girl's fancy, sang war-cries, and echoed the sound&#xD;
of cannon and musket-shots. She heard the tramp of men marching to the&#xD;
charge. She heard their shouts, theii- groans; their dying moans. She saw her&#xD;
own lover shot'down, Oh, God ! temper the wind to her,.for it was very chill&#xD;
and bitter ; and she shuddered.&#xD;
The winds sobbed, as people do in grief. The rain fell, like tears from over-&#xD;
charged eyes. It pattered against the little casement; and swept with a hurried&#xD;
rush over eaves and roof. - Heaven pity all in the storm this night, she said to&#xD;
herself; and she prayed that God would protect the poor lad who had loved her,&#xD;
but whose headstrong will and passions had wrought the web of his own doom.&#xD;
The day had brought its duties, and with it a feverish attention, that awhile&#xD;
distracted her' mind from its sombre occupants. But when that day 'was over,&#xD;
when the work was done, and night brought ease and leisure, how was 'it spent?&#xD;
There was 'no relaxation, 'no cheerfulness. She had 'not to prepare the supper, to&#xD;
attend to Lobbert'gslightest wish, to-'be anxious that he should be pleased. 'She&#xD;
had nothing but her own thoughts, and, of a truth, they. were not the beft  things&#xD;
for a poor loving girl's heart to be occupied with.&#xD;

,TH:- TWIN DBUOTHE1RS.&#xD;
The aecustomed chimney corner was vacant. Would it ever be filled more --&#xD;
for she tried to hope, and oh! the weary, weary pain of attempting that against&#xD;
conviction. 'It was empty now ; and had she not dreamed her waking dream of&#xD;
her lover lost, dead perhaps, lying on the plaion,.With the wind singing his dirge,&#xD;
with that of many another rash, brave lad, and the rain drenching his corpse?&#xD;
But what could he heed of that: now ?-&#xD;
" When he comes back," said the sergeant, ".he'll be a soldier, and you'll be&#xD;
proud ofhim."                                r&#xD;
So she. would, and be very :proud ,of him too, if he did but. return. The ser-&#xD;
geant had. assured her so. Well, there was a little comfort in that. reflection, and&#xD;
she made the best of;it, as. all' women in tribulation do.r&#xD;
Would he come back? ,What's that?  Both started with pale faces and eager&#xD;
eyes,,,the mother and the niece looked on each other---pale with dismay and anxiety.&#xD;
"What's-that?'f Something tapped at the;,window. Could it be possible?&#xD;
But no. : The wind sobbed: aloud. The rain beat heavily. That was all. Their&#xD;
faces grew blank. Their eyes fell again.&#xD;
But the tapping is renewed  It grows importunate-loud. It is now at the&#xD;
widow-now at the door. What can it be ? who can it be!,&#xD;
"fMother 1" says the niece ; "Mother " says poor Jane trembling from head to&#xD;
foot ,  ,5,       '&#xD;
Jane 'responds the other,. shaken to the very heart:  '&#xD;
- "What, canbeetheret, Openy!"&#xD;
Each says.so:simultaneously- and each, out of the very wildest hope, dreads -to&#xD;
move. But they must, for the knocking grows- louder. The, latch is tried, but&#xD;
the door is fastened.within. It will not give way.; . ,. .&#xD;
They getup. Theygo with tottering steps to the door, and both say-4their&#xD;
souls, a§ it were, hanging on the reply-botheall' out breathlessly  Who is&#xD;
there ?"       ,".&#xD;
"It is me-it's Robert !' is the reply.&#xD;
With tremulous hands; the door is unfastened. A figure, wearied to death,:dusty,&#xD;
soiled, in a tattered and sordid garb, totters, "n,.and the door .'shut quickly, and&#xD;
locked.&#xD;
" '" My Robert I--oh, my Robert !" sobs Jane.,&#xD;
My .son 1 My child! . .Oh God, protect, him!." sobs the mother.&#xD;
What. wild and thrilling agonies of fear andl love moves them now! They em-&#xD;
brace, they sob, they cannot speak; only the:names are mentioned, and the man&#xD;
cries like a child.&#xD;
"My dear boy !--my darling Robert!" says the another, When she can; speak ;&#xD;
what have they done to you ?"&#xD;
"They have made me mad. They have made a devil of me. They flogged me&#xD;
like a dog-lashed me like a hound-for what they call a breach of duty; .and, as&#xD;
heaven is above me, I onlysinned in ignorance. I endeavored to, do all I could ;&#xD;
I was sober,attentive, respectful, and I committed a fault without knowing or in-&#xD;
tending i.They flogged me,d-n themI" he said. through his gnashing teeth,&#xD;
"and I deserted!l"&#xD;
Dame Morris did not .know, why she shuddered, and felt a greater dread than&#xD;
ever. Those with whom he ;went must now be far away. -Ie had been, flogged !&#xD;
His poor back-had been wounded with thebrutal whip ! She did notknow the&#xD;
reality.. She did not know that it was even then raw and bleeding.. She did .not&#xD;
imagine thatsthe torture of the condemned were even then being: undergone by&#xD;
him, She had him back, and he would leave. them, no more.&#xD;
But to flog him, so young, so ignorant, so willing ! Why, they must be-human&#xD;
devils ! 'They must be very brutal, these officers, these gentlemen, these nolemnen.&#xD;
these ducated, polished, ien, and make no allowance for anything ! . Not a .bjt:!&#xD;

THE TW IT -B1OTHERS-.&#xD;
the simple picture of torture which it was his ill-fortune to have undergone. In&#xD;
the necessities of life there are many phases of suffering and endurance, and, gen-&#xD;
erally speaking, men do not -complain and grumble at them, because -they are&#xD;
among the categories of things which:all must meet with the like chances ; but&#xD;
those things inflicted wantonly, and with all the rigor of an- unmitigated barba-&#xD;
rity, heightened by skill in the .multiplication of torture, which is truly infernal,&#xD;
it cannot be expected that patience will hold out ; it cannot be desired, even, that&#xD;
a despicable submission to such can come within the scope and limits of human&#xD;
duties&#xD;
"You must hide me, mother I" he said ; "you must hide me! I must lie like&#xD;
the squirrels in , the winter."&#xD;
" Hide you! What for ?" asked Dame Morris.&#xD;
"They will send in search of me !'r he replied.&#xD;
." And if they find you ?": asked Jane, as Rose before this had asked her lover;&#xD;
Edward.&#xD;
"They will flog, imprison, transport, or perhaps shoot me," was the answer.&#xD;
"To desert in time of war is a capital crime," he added, with. the emphasis of a&#xD;
jurist.&#xD;
"Capital crime!" :murmured Jane, and she smiled.&#xD;
In the grotesque association of words and meanings, even in the tremendous&#xD;
moment, something that is irresistibly absurd will strike the active fancy, Such&#xD;
was -now the case.&#xD;
Robert smiled too. "Capitalcrime I" he repeated. " It is not capital, my girl&#xD;
as we should say, ' clever, excellent,' or ' well managed.': Ah, no ! I havelearn:&#xD;
ed a good deal in ithe few days I have been'away; and, it means an act for which&#xD;
you must pay with imprisonment for-life,:the hulks, or the penal settlement-.&#xD;
you see I've picked up a few fine words,; with large meanings to them, too---or&#xD;
with your life," he added, correcting the deviation he hadmade.&#xD;
This was confirming the vague, dread, .both :the females felt. They knew he&#xD;
could not hope to escape withoutsome risk.'&#xD;
They bathed his bruised shoulder with oil. They tenderly aided him, up into&#xD;
an old loft where he might lie hid and remain until the rumor and the.search, if&#xD;
search there would be, was over. They ^began to feel lighter-+despite the&#xD;
bruised back and the degrading punishmerit-for they had him back, spite of&#xD;
all.&#xD;
a"Is Sergeant Kitely about yet ?" aked Robert, as he went up the ladder-like&#xD;
staircase.&#xD;
" Yes;" replied both, in a breath.. "Why?"&#xD;
"Then I am not safe," he added. " He will know me directly."&#xD;
"-He must not see you," .said they, encouragingly.&#xD;
" I must leave here, I tell you," replied Robert _&#xD;
" Not to-night," they urged, tenderly.&#xD;
"To-night ! 'I couldn't walk half-a-mile farther.' No, but to-morrow I must go&#xD;
farther away." -'And.he crept to his pallet.- And if he slept it was because na-&#xD;
ture was exhausted. It- was more than his 'mother or his cousin did ; but they&#xD;
were much happier.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
4rHE CAPTU RE.&#xD;
THE next day and the next passed by, and Robert is still in hiding. They hope&#xD;
with all their souls that the sergeant, with his drums and fifes, will leave the&#xD;
neighborhood, as they cannot be at ease- while he is near. If he only happens to&#xD;
pass the door, and cast a glance in at the window, Dame Morris 'and Jane turn&#xD;
quite pale, and tremble for the safety of the poor wretch up-stairs.&#xD;
By and bye it is rumored that recruitingis over in-,this quarter, and not a ves&#xD;
tige of a soldier will be seen when the week is past. 'They arse more hopeful now&#xD;
They fear lessand less, daily ; but there is no certainty. Robert, who had in-&#xD;
tended to change his hiding-place, changed his mind. His frame was not equal&#xD;
to the fatigue. The strong and insurmountable feeling-of self-preservation, that&#xD;
had nerved him to so difficult and tremendous a task, had now, quitted him. He&#xD;
felt his bruised limbs at ease. ' He was at home. 'He would 'remain there ; and so&#xD;
he did.&#xD;
But woe to their hopes. The jolly sergeant, who has a sinister smile on his-&#xD;
deceitful lips, sudden  appears, and there is with him a corporal,' and a couple of&#xD;
files of soldiers armed with muskets and'bayonets. What'do they want?  Dame&#xD;
Morris, in mortal agony, thinks.she can answer that question, but she will not. It&#xD;
would be too terrible to admit the full force of the hideous presentiment that had&#xD;
crossed their threshold, and once more, like a spectre, taken its abode on their&#xD;
hearth, darkening and blighting everything within the circle of its influence.-&#xD;
' They are looking for Robert !" this spectre would 'whisper though the mother&#xD;
would stop her ears, and deny it. "Take care of him, mother! Take care of&#xD;
your son !".it would go on, the haunting spectre. "And :this time, if you lose&#xD;
him, you will never have him back !-never--never again !" So ran on its deadly&#xD;
mutterings.&#xD;
It was undoubtedly very trying, this sort of life. ,'It was harassing to be always-&#xD;
startled by a strange step at the door, to feel the heart sink when a knocking sum-&#xD;
moned Dame Morris or Jane to open, since they expected to see before their the&#xD;
armed soldiers in search of the missing man,, who were hunting the deserter,. in&#xD;
order that they might flog the flesh off hissbones, as a' warning to others ; and'&#xD;
this wretched nervousness only increased , hen -the jovial sergeant and his' party&#xD;
appeared, and it was rumored-that they were looking for no other -than Robert&#xD;
Morris. Then their terror reached its climax ; and it was resolved, in' a consulta-.&#xD;
tion that Robert, his mother, and his cousin held, that he should escape a second&#xD;
time that night, and seek a shelter elsewhere.&#xD;
The day wore on heavily, and all longed for the evening, since only under its fa-&#xD;
voring shadows could the escape be made. , And there were yet several hours in-&#xD;
tervening. The strange step redoubled their terrors., The neighbors at the&#xD;
door suggested the armed power, which to them was more potential ,than the de-&#xD;
cree of fate, awakened their dread, and intensified every fear. They were un-&#xD;
strung, nervous, and all of a trembling terror.'- Such a condition is one of the&#xD;
most pitiable, perhaps, that can afflict a human creature, for as it attacks the af-&#xD;
fections, the pain must necessarily be sharper and keener. -Honr after hour pas-&#xD;
sed by, however, and the dreaded soldiers came not.f May heaven prevent them&#xD;
for awhile longer, and then they will be at ease !&#xD;
It was afternoon. Jane had gone forth to procure the co-operation of a distant&#xD;
neighbor. Charles was at the time in conversation withi Sergeant Kitely. The&#xD;
o~lly sergeant was obtaining the warrant of arrest ; and with' her heprt at her&#xD;
pits very action almost suspended, Dame Morris sat by her fire, while Robert,&#xD;

&#xD;
pale and shaken with his own deep dread, lay-still in hiding in the little loft, his&#xD;
heart filled with apprehension&#xD;
Hark!!what is that which makes the poor widow faint to the heart, and blanches&#xD;
her aged cheeks. It is her fancy, perhaps. No, for this time it is "tramp-.&#xD;
trami.! tramp !" and the 'unmistakable sound of heavy feet, in "the unison of a.&#xD;
military step, comes with a vagte nienace to her ear. They halt at her door! 'and&#xD;
the heavy grounding of the muskets, and a knock, deep, single; and impressive, are&#xD;
heard.&#xD;
" Oh ! my boy-my boy V" she murmurs. "They are here !"&#xD;
The knock is impatiently repeated. :What can she do ?  She may not open,&#xD;
and cannot resist. The latch is lifted. The door is fastened. Itmight not have&#xD;
been done so purposely, but by some instinct she had put the bar across when&#xD;
Jane left the house.&#xD;
The latch is tried. The next moment the butt-end, of a musket sent the frail&#xD;
bar in fragments. The door flies open. The scarlet coats, the gleaming bayonets,&#xD;
the brown firelocks, the stern, silent men are there. No vision of terror can equal&#xD;
that awful reality. The jolly sergeant, with a jest, enters ; a paper is in his hand.&#xD;
It~is the warrant.&#xD;
"INow, dame !" he said-" now, mother ! I want Robert Morris."&#xD;
",He is-Ahe is- --" 'she began stammering.&#xD;
"'He is here," said the sergeant, "It's no use, old lady ; I'nm not to be done.&#xD;
Look alive, lads!' Ferret himouta!" and as she falls in a swoon on the floor, one&#xD;
man, more humane than the rest lifts her to a chair, while two others, disregard&#xD;
iig' the cries of the little child en, mount the stairs, the loft-ladder, and finally&#xD;
come forth, dragging the livid and unstrung victim  with them. In a dead, dead&#xD;
faint lies the mother, and heaven is merciful to her. The poor lad casts a glance&#xD;
of tenderness and despair upon- her, and his hands are pinioned without a word.&#xD;
They are gone forth Ore' Jane, who has completed- her arrangements with a&#xD;
neighbor, has time to return. Downcast, with a vertigo that' made'the brain&#xD;
swim, and blinded eyes, and stopped-up ears, the corpse-like man staggered on be-&#xD;
tween his captors. All was ber for ever.        e Adie, brother ! rae ye well,&#xD;
Jane!' The red whip, a round of ball, and a grave in some obscure corner, that's&#xD;
My' end now !" and so brokenly swept this fancy in his brain. It was thus' that&#xD;
Charles saw the poor fellow pass him.&#xD;
Jane was hurrying home, had turned the corner of a street, when she saw a&#xD;
crowd of people, men, women,.and children, moving forward, and caught the glit-&#xD;
ter of bayonets. She stoodstill,'as if-she had been changed into stone. What&#xD;
-fedr was it that spoke his name-that 'showed him snared and caught, if it was&#xD;
not that instinctive truth that carries a foregone conviction with it, and which is&#xD;
incontrovertible? 3It muse be Robert! Her leaden feet moved with difficulty,-&#xD;
the blood that stagnated a moment moved again in her breast-she tottered fors&#xD;
ward, and with a piercing cry, uttered the nane -of "Robert!'&#xD;
He gave a start, and halted too.&#xD;
" Forward !" said the corporal---" March !"&#xD;
A chariot with blazonedj panels was going by at the moment. It bore fair&#xD;
women, 'who cast only 'a listless, heedless glance at the crowd, and the. cry 'of the&#xD;
girl only told them that there was a great strife of horror near them. "But these&#xD;
people Were not of' their class; -they could not spare sympathy so absurdly mis-&#xD;
placed, and, what was mdre, they did not. The carriage rolled 'on, and the per'&#xD;
fumed occupants thought of their own little woes, and magnified them accord-&#xD;
ingly.                                                               r&#xD;
There is a lady, however, with a fair pale face, full of pity and tenderness, look.&#xD;
ing on, for in those livid lipst and-iopeless eyes-in the cry of the pooi- gir,'she&#xD;
read a sad, sad story, and it reminded her of a spn she herself had1 far, far away in&#xD;
the Indian army; and 'she went by sighing heavily, praying for' the two Wrecked&#xD;
creatures she could not otherwise help.&#xD;

PICKING UP.&#xD;
Ir is not necessary here to detail the weary. life which Charles led after he had&#xD;
been surrendered into the hands of theferocious drill-sergeant,'whosetlessons 'were&#xD;
administered witia sternness that made the, man thin' now and 'then that the&#xD;
rattan which that subordinate. -fficer wielded,;would, instead of flourishing 'in 'the&#xD;
air, describe a flourish more: than once upon his 'shoulders. If. such had been the&#xD;
case, there would have been little help fo:rthe outrage. Charles. beheld it done&#xD;
morethan once, and only avoided its himself by an attention to the minutims of his&#xD;
new duties, which won noappreciation from the mechanical individual who mould-&#xD;
ed him into a-rmachine to be. mo:ed at will,.to act with the steady, correct,&#xD;
a d unreflecting regularity of. a. steak engine, and to be just as destitute of senti..&#xD;

Je bore all, did all, learned all, with an apathy that 'was, perhaps, better for&#xD;
the perfect state of his drill than any application, on. his. own part would, have&#xD;
been.. The same;feeling, too, or rather the absence'of +all !feeling, on -that sconen e&#xD;
made him blind and deaf to the rude gesture,the harsh..:voice, the repulsive ' man'&#xD;
ner, of the impassable individual to whom he had been consigned.,. The exigences&#xD;
of the case.were such}asspeedily to releasehim from;this daily torture, and he&#xD;
was soon drafted' into his regiment, so far as'the manipulation went,-a,"perfect -sol.&#xD;
dier, -who lacked nothing but experience and a battle.&#xD;
He had not long to wait before he knew that the promises of the recruiting'&#xD;
sergeant, Kitely, as regarded the Harpy; were among the number, of .those admir-&#xD;
able fictions that worthy never ,hesitated to perpetrate. Thesullen fury with&#xD;
which Charles brooded over this was stifled by the uselessness of complaint orre.&#xD;
sistance, and the first thought of desertion was .speedily scattered by witnessing&#xD;
the fate of Robert Morris, whom he -again saw at;his -parade-ground, brought up&#xD;
to receive the punishment.of his defection, a court-martial having pronounced up-&#xD;
on him the sentence of two hundred and fifty lashes, and the drafting, after into a&#xD;
foreia egiment,,      I   A&#xD;
The eep, unutterable loathing which Oharles tpok to. his profession was con-&#xD;
solida- and indurated by the horrible scene he, beheld., The first lash sent a&#xD;
thrill of sickn es and horror through his, being. He'beheld the'lash grow clogged&#xD;
with lumps of flesh, and the spattering of the blood}seemed to have converted the'&#xD;
air into a moist and sanguine medium, which ;transformed those around him&#xD;
into so .many several .incarnations of the horrible,,, and the executioner, into a&#xD;
fiend.            ...  .  -&#xD;
While the head of the soldier fell on his breast,, and the doctor stepped to feel&#xD;
:he pulse, which, under the excess of the lash, had become still, Charles had fallen&#xD;
un the ranks, and was carriedaway fainting. He was. told that the mutilated man&#xD;

ceive the reside, if all had not been administered; atid that'thenche-*ould be sent&#xD;
abroad, to be killed by savages or die of; a swamp fever. Le saw poor 'Morris,&#xD;
then, no more.&#xD;
That same night, while Charles lay in his bed still laboring under, the&#xD;
sickness, of heart !that revolting spectacle ;had Created, he dreamt of his absent&#xD;
brother..&#xD;
The confused shadows increased, multiplied, grewinall their varieties'of interest;&#xD;
their attractiveor repulsive forms,.their fantastic or familiar aspects, before the&#xD;
active and creative fancy could suggest or adapt ; and dreams, that;in as singular&#xD;
extremewere marked with  the vivid hues of life, 'crowded- around hin, and the&#xD;
communion, which the psychological-construction of, their moral nature rendered&#xD;
perfect, but not to be explained, was once more entered into.&#xD;
Over plain and forest, mountain and river, rock and fell, the winged minister&#xD;
swept, and he:beheld 'a great sea spread and trodden out before him, ';There was&#xD;
light in the sky, and the green depths were, translucent, and a soft halcyon breeze&#xD;
passed over the-surface,:and filled the light sails of boats. dotting the distance,&#xD;
where the;fisherman, or the'bold pilot, were plying their perilous but usefUl avo,&#xD;
cations._t&#xD;
Then came the boom of a gun, sounding a harsh dissonance on the dancing&#xD;
waves; objects, at first indistinct, grew broader in their outline, and the white&#xD;
sails of ships were seen growing larger' and larger ; then a fleet of stately men-of-&#xD;
.war appeared, with sails set, the cannon in serried ranks pointed, and ready run&#xD;
out, the men at-the guns, the officers at:the post, while the flag of St. George in-&#xD;
dicated that they were English.&#xD;
The gun was echoed by another ; r and1 with the flag of France flying at the&#xD;
mast-head, the regal lilies having given place to the tricolor, the fleet of the French&#xD;
marine:hove up above the.horison, and both came to meet each ; other with aspects&#xD;
calm, pictateeque, and beautiful, rather, like floating 'swans, about to exchange&#xD;
friendly greetings and good wishes, thanto belch forth fire. and death- into.%eaeh.&#xD;
Then began the .thunderous cannonading, and the fires of; a sea-fight ,lighted, up&#xD;
a lurid gloom that the gathering smoke produced and the eight. menthat manned&#xD;
every gun grew grimand bloody, and .black, with the furious work. There. were&#xD;
masts crashing, men shriekingwith:'pain, or breathing deep curses, and they met&#xD;
on the.,bulwarks with cut, and thi-ust, and stab, and deadly shot i. and the ships&#xD;
were riddled, looking like char-ed.;cinders, and baring' theit fractured ribs like' the&#xD;
spectres of vessels that had'. 'been destroyed, and yet haunted the scene of their&#xD;
terrible conflict&#xD;
.Then, amid awful cries, one of the battered battle-ships;riddled and: broken&#xD;
from the bulwarks,to the water, gave a great groan, a terrible plunge; 'and amidst&#xD;
cries of victory and dread, she 'plunged'-into the depths of the sea, and was seen no&#xD;
more.                                             .   -.&#xD;
SFrom' 'the decks 'of 'nothet ai'ose dense volumes of smoke-'and flame, which&#xD;
, climbed around niast and' rigging arid eagerly licked the air with, for'ked tongues&#xD;
of fire, From end. to end rose criestfor help, andidesperate men. leaped from the&#xD;
side into the waves, and those that were not killed by shot and shell, died for the&#xD;
most~part by drowning. 'Then boattwer~e lowered and :put fof-th in order to pick&#xD;
up such as were still enabled ito sustain 'theruselves by swimming, or bficlinging to:&#xD;
pieces of the wreck that 'were floating about in all directions.&#xD;
SThe attention of the sleeper was iThen drawn to'one, whose foi-m and face, flecks.&#xD;
ed 'with blood, and blackened with .smoke and powder, was helplessly':Bloating&#xD;
about, and whileithe eyess were closing in the fastness 'of death, the relaxed, and&#xD;
flaccid limbs, as if tangled with sea-weed, which tied -and fastened theiii up, re-&#xD;
tarding their action, were being ttossad from side to side. This fOrm was droWn-&#xD;

ward-! mybrotherEdward-!" he seemed to cry aloud, but none heard the stifled&#xD;
exclamation.&#xD;
And the deeper struggled in his vastieffortsto plunge into the waters-tainted&#xD;
with,=the hues of carnage--to ,save him; but he felt as if chained down by&#xD;
some resistless power, and his mental tortures were tlhus increased a hundred-&#xD;
fold.&#xD;
Presently a boat came up, and strong arms willingly stretched themselves forth,&#xD;
and grasped the drowning man in the very nick of time. Into the boat the form&#xD;
was puled, and with the rough, yet tender roughness of'seamen, he was lifted&#xD;
through a port, and carried down into the cockpit, where restoratives were ap..&#xD;
plied, and-his hurts looked into.&#xD;
The active sympathy which had thus placed before the twin-brother, for a second&#xD;
time, the risk whih the other had gone through, was now, from the veryfact of&#xD;
his safety being assured,:weakened. The outlines of the ruddy waters, the blazing&#xD;
ships, the 'foundering hulks; and the.taking of those in tow which it was possible&#xD;
to do by:the survivors, now grew faint and dim. Presently all vanished, and a&#xD;
deep refreshing sleep:fell over Charles, as the quiescent mind surrendered itself to&#xD;
the calm influences now impressed upon it, so that .the :next morning he awoke&#xD;
cheerful, feeling assured that Edward lived, and that danger was once more aver-&#xD;
ted from him.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
THE BIIVOUA.&#xD;
MANY inonths hadanow passed by. 'Edward'had become a sailor- --was held to&#xD;
be one of the smartest hands, and boldest, bravest men on board the Harpy-; but&#xD;
he ,was also known for being as kind as brave, as temperate in language as in all&#xD;
else, for which he would have been despised by his messmates, if they 'had not&#xD;
known the innate manliness of his disposition;-and he was respected and beloved&#xD;
accordingly. -Besides, Pipes, who was held up as a high authority in all matters,&#xD;
owed his life to him, and the brave old man loved him like a son-a fact that told&#xD;
more in Edward's favor than even his own admirable qualities could have done.&#xD;
Rose had been enabled to shed a rayof joy-on the darkened lives of the old people,;&#xD;
for Mhost-simultaneously.came letters .from Charles 1 nd Edwardistating that they&#xD;
had been in battle, had been wounded, and had recovered, and expressing 'hopes-&#xD;
thatif the war closedsoon, as it was likely to do (thoughthe American war broke&#xD;
out soon after), they ,would return to the -bosom of their family.&#xD;
Of Ellen Freshville no news had been heard; and the old man, like a raging lion,&#xD;
when he knew of her love for Charles, and that it was solely on his account that&#xD;
she quitted-her parental roof, found no measure in the indignant terms with which&#xD;
he denounced. and execrated the son of the village carpenter, as he called Martino&#xD;
Palmer,-a-'course that produced just the amount of satisfaction that might have&#xD;
been expected.=&#xD;
Charles: was in Spain =meanwhile, soon after the taking of Badajoz (and the&#xD;
battle Qf'Sdaamanca) and thanked God that 'he had been spared any share in, or'&#xD;
sight of, the fiendish atrocities that had' been committed there, where men, women,,&#xD;
and children were indiscriminately butchered:in: cold blood;, the episodes of this&#xD;
unutterable storming being the most infamous that blacken the chronicles of war,&#xD;
and illustrating lu'hues the most dreadful the extent -to which the unrestrained pas.&#xD;
aionisiof lust, murder,'and conquest can uirge men to go.--: ..-.&#xD;
-'The capture of 'Madrid,.and. the retreat ofu Joseph- Bonaparte: from thence, was&#xD;
succeeded by a series of battles and victories of more or less consequence to the:&#xD;
armes tlere engaged; and in several of which Charles was' compelled to take his&#xD;

nature was not deficient in' that courage which can face danger and 1eath with un-&#xD;

which, under the peculiati citcumstances they are rendered,-enhance their value so&#xD;
greatly; and ponsolidates.the good understanding that should always exist among&#xD;
a community of men.&#xD;
The Ehglish army under Wellington was Oncampndionthe Plains of Vittoria,&#xD;
and the enemy under Marshal Jourdan rwashsit great force arrayed against, them,&#xD;
and the battle was likely to be one of the most important and desperately contested&#xD;
of any that had yet been fought. - Upon its issue.depended the mightiest results;&#xD;
and as both were equally confident and daring, and there was an enormous quantity&#xD;
of cannon in the field, the sacrifice of life waslikelyto be immen'se-a very second&#xD;
ary 'consideration to the generals, whatever it might'be to the men.&#xD;
Night had fallen 'upon the-tented: plain, and'the blaze 'of watch-fires, spattered&#xD;
for miles inlength, indicated 'the lines. of the two great armies.- Silent and still&#xD;
as wre'the heavens, with only the inelancholy wind' sweeping mournfully over&#xD;
head, and now and then opening the.flags as they hung listlessly'fto'the poles, there&#xD;
wass confused 'muimur,: wiehr iingled'-with the occasional neighing of'-horses,&#xD;
the challenge of the sentinel, the tramp of -men going'their -rounds, the 'rush of&#xD;
mounted officers, wrapped =in cloaks, who ;were, reconnoitring the different posts,&#xD;
the clang of aris, together .with those varieties of sounds 'which will gather and&#xD;
arise whei:vast bodies of=menare gathe~ed'inrlarge assemblies.&#xD;
The.scene was picturesque enough, beneath' the pale, soft moonlight, and the far-&#xD;
flashing fires of' the' bivouacs. 'Here were 'pitched-a-eluster of white: tents, where&#xD;
the officers iested and slept ; there, was a troop of horse, picketed; and looming&#xD;
sternly in the obscurity of the distance might have- been seen the serried lines of&#xD;
the slumbe rin~gcannon, ready to{open their :fiery throats 'ahddischarge their deadly&#xD;
messengers'with all the a effect' that consummate skilland a slaughtQrous impulse&#xD;
could suggest. It :ws ta- scene on which the' imagination' could dwell 'with a&#xD;
significant,moral and' with vety sad and solenin deductions; But' sleep now&#xD;
visited most 'of the 'weary ones; and if they dreamt, it 'was- mostly of home;'of&#xD;
those beloved, or lost and far a ay.&#xD;
Among;a group, whose-axis were piled around a watch-fire, and around which&#xD;
the wakeful sentinels'traversedto and fro, wrappedup in his-niilitary coat, and with&#xD;
his head pillowed on his knapsack, was Charles Palmer. He slept not. His busy&#xD;
fancy was far toovivid'to woo that slumber which was 'so delicious' t. his tired&#xD;
comrades. Something had°so utterly' 'driven it saway, that he lay on his elbow&#xD;
end peeredsamiong, the distant "shadows justlwhere' the light of the fires- mingled&#xD;
with the partial darkness, and where he fancied he had seen a shadowy form pass&#xD;
with a'ligli butseiriouhstep   '&#xD;
'Yes'; bf- the'side of}the '°treamnlet, beneath-the nodding beeohes, wandering on&#xD;
the flo*6rgtnarge of those'singing waters 'with birds andssunshine above his head,&#xD;
the rapt youth'wa'bnonrie away, and with' him, clasped to his side, walked the pham.&#xD;
torn of his th'cughsEllen ! If A had  repudiated'her,;his heart clung to . her.&#xD;
'What had thus carried him back to what was a fallacy and a falsehdod?&#xD;
Had he beheld that face anywhere since hequited hoane? Had some strange&#xD;
fortune, by a change,'Fthrown her across his path?&#xD;
'lb 'heave s, there 'it 'is again1!i' he claimede' with a: sudden start.&#xD;
" Why comrade, what is;the maltter-with=you ?' demanded a soldier, who turned&#xD;

" Did you see anything ?-did any one pass ?" asked Charles, 'in breathless&#xD;

"Pass? No! You must have been dreaming," was the reply,- j" dreaming and&#xD;
tkiiikihg ot ti d" light of other days'"&#xD;

" "All thesame," responded his comrade ;:"'for when one is thinking of home, or&#xD;
of one's sweetheart, one dreams just thesame:' comrade- i '&#xD;
"'Yes," returned Charles, after a pause,-during which he' still followed the form&#xD;
with his eyes -till;it vanished ; and then falling back, with a sigh, "Yes,'yes, I sup-&#xD;
pose, it'is so-: onlythat some'.are more vivid than others".'?  .&#xD;
s'rWhy,,you have not seenanything, have you ?" asked the soldier, in a tope of&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
' IL have-that-is,'I'think II have," returned Charles; 'and some might take it&#xD;
as an evil' omen -as a messenger of death."      -a ''&#xD;
'Every bullet has its billet, comrade, and some of us will get it to-morrow&#xD;
without ever a message being sent," was the philosophic reply. :" After 'all, what&#xD;
does itmatter 7" 'r'         :&#xD;
" Well,"'said Charles, moodily, "'perhaps very little in the end."&#xD;
" All the same to'.me," spoke a young andsingularly handsomen soldier, who, by&#xD;
his wild-and tameless excessespandby the ardor with:which he had plunged into the&#xD;
heat 'of.the fight on more than one occasion,'seemed really to have 'conceived a&#xD;
disgust at life ;.:the result (if such it was)' doubtless of some event that had ren-&#xD;
dered it:unbea-rable to him.                              .-:&#xD;
Hewas aimere ladin age and appearance, and yet his temples were-fringed with&#xD;
gray.hairs. With an impunity that: startled some:of the stoutest topers of the&#xD;
regiment-and there were not wanting plenty, whose feats of excess would have&#xD;
done credit t&amp;amp;6 one of the: Homeric; heroes- in. their. drinking exploitsr-he could&#xD;
swallow the most heady wines; the'most fiery spirits and iin such undiluted quanti-&#xD;
ties as would hive beeni followed, in. niostt cases, with :intoxication, 'if not ,total&#xD;
stupefaction ;'ibut owing -to some derangment-of 4the nervous or mental system, his&#xD;
excesses had-no'effect upon him  His boyish, pallid face, so beautiful, struck one&#xD;
withthe terrible melancholy{ which was expressed upon it. His eyes had a dull&#xD;
sombre fire in them, 'which told that when he did sinkif he was not killed in bat-&#xD;
tie- it would be once sudden and unannounced. He -seemed to- fearnothing, to&#xD;
lose; or hate. nothing,,to be' frightfully indifferent: to everything living or dead.&#xD;
"All the same," he' said,. with weary air. - "It would be barely achange.".&#xD;
There was a mystery in his;history, suggested by his slight aristocratic-looking&#xD;
face and frame, his manner, his words, his own, individuality. It must have .been&#xD;
some dreadful:, event'that' placed the. winter :of sixty .on that head of barely a&#xD;
score,-that out of the heart of, a boy, cast out -by a frosty winter, the genial&#xD;
smniner :of his youth.&#xD;
" There! there.1" cried Charles, once more suddenly, drawing the attention of the&#xD;
men where 'it had been' fastened by the reckless words, -and which now. followed&#xD;
the finger-of Charles, that pointed to some object he alone .(so they asserted)&#xD;
could' see.   ;.             .t&#xD;
The figure of a woman hovering on the outer circle of the bivouac was certain&#xD;
ly very distinctly!seen. ; With parted lips, and'eyes that seemed starting out of&#xD;
their sockets,'.Charlesraised himself still; higher on hist arm,and fixed his IQok&#xD;
upon-this form, that with a slow step' passed :on, now vanishing, behind some&#xD;
projecting mass of arms, or lost in the shadow of a tent, and- again crossing the&#xD;
bars of fiery light. ..&#xD;
"Do. younot sed anything now ?" he asked.&#xD;
" I see nothing," was repeated by one and another, in turn.&#xD;
The moonshine fell-'on theftace, once more, lit {as-white, clear,., and certainly&#xD;
more' pha'ntom.like than real. 'Then it vanished again.. '&#xD;
"Whose tent is that yonder ?" asked Charles, pointing to one some consider'&#xD;
ble distance away:  'i'&#xD;
"Major Freshville's of the -th foot," was the answer. " Djdn't you , now it ?'&#xD;
nsked his eorn.radein turn.{.               '&#xD;
No, he did not kimw it-had never heard the name,.that he remsmnbered.; but&#xD;

Freshville ! A tremor ran' through all his frame as a train of conflicting fancies&#xD;
came crowding confusedly upon him. His first impulse was to hurry after the&#xD;
figure ; and his next was, with a proud submission, to fall back again on his arm.&#xD;
"What matters it ?" he murmured.&#xD;
His eyes fell on the gloomy, but, fair,'and how'fearfully white face of the young&#xD;
soldier, who had spoken of life and death with a kind of scoffing impiety, that at&#xD;
the moment shocked Charled'; but hei read in it so vast a tale of human wreck&#xD;
and misery, that he was ashamed of his own sorrow, for here was a greater.&#xD;
And sorrow, be it known, is a sacred thing among the most reckless.&#xD;
d' Do you then careso little what comes of 'the morrow ?'" said Charles to him&#xD;
in a low tone.&#xD;
"No more than I do for the smoke -that comes from the  corporal's pipe," said&#xD;
the  youth;.&#xD;
"It must be something'very sad-"&#xD;
"I 'have'a silent"sorrow' heie,"'exclaihied the youig soldir;,'with a wild, short,&#xD;
scoffing laugh,laying his hand Abohi Heart.&#xD;
"Tell ustwhat it i;, Dick;will you ?"'said a comrade, in reply. " Aye, tell us your&#xD;
story, lad, if'=you -caa't go to sleep. I' think Charley, here has-seen a ghost, that&#xD;
he looks so white about it, and has roused me up. iMay I never, if here's not two&#xD;
or three more turning-up. Zooks! lads,' this is bad preparation for a, day's work."&#xD;
And another Was added to the'gi-oup.                                . .&#xD;
Well, let young' Dick, here, tell his'story," suggested.the first. "I'll tell'mine,&#xD;
if there's any storyeto tell--it's: short and sweet--but if his be long enough to&#xD;
send us to sleep again  "&#xD;
"Why, we'll thank him," broke irV a fourth,&#xD;
- The young man, who turned from one to the other, a face on which some strong&#xD;
emotion was working, paused a moment/ and then said, "Well, my lads, since to-&#xD;
morrow will end all, or- else 'I must try'some other means-But pass 'me your&#xD;

to the soldier, 'Dick' as he was. fainiliarly termed, after' having taken a deep pull,&#xD;

'Their curiosity'was greatly excited, and silently a dozen' men gathered round,&#xD;
leaning on  their arms in a cidrle ;  the majority' of 'whom, lit their 'ipes, in order&#xD;
to give a deeper relish to the story, which every one had an idea must contain some&#xD;

"Yes, yes, we know," ran in low murmurs round. -                 , '&#xD;

and purple, and'grew up as pne born to command. : I went to. college, and very&#xD;
likely you think I was a wild, harum-scrum devil of, a. fellow-boating, driving,&#xD;
hunting, gowning-and-towning, it-cultivting women, wine,,cardsrand so on,-as&#xD;
you may have heard that young fellows with plenty of, money do. Well, if you&#xD;
think so, you are mistaken. I was a quiet studious young man. I might add:&#xD;
noral,"-and his sardonic laugh jarred as before,; "and it.wouldt have been per-&#xD;
fectly true. I loved books, study, and peace, was a gool scholar, studied music&#xD;
and the arts, fenced like Angelo--there is not a man ii;the army, perhaps, that&#xD;
can play at the small-sword with me-and quiet as an infant,, I still had a spica&#xD;
of a wild, tremendous, explosive fiery, devil nme.;&#xD;
I fell in love, ha! ha ! with a little doll of a girl about my age, that was seven-&#xD;
teen, and for whom I would have taken m  heart out of my bosom.- She was sa.&#xD;
frail and fairy-like a creaturethatI could have put her in my breast to shelter as,&#xD;
one would a little bird ; and she ldved -me with suc strength of faith, that had,&#xD;
I been Don Juan himself; there was such lavish trust in her, that. she would have.&#xD;
converted me from a-debauchee into a true, honest man.&#xD;
"She is 'as still now as a frozen rill-slee Ani like the streams in winter-she.&#xD;
will never waken again.  and his head fell., on his .breast, though his eyes, which&#xD;
ere burning with the rpain of his:strog agony, were not moistened with a tear.&#xD;
Theyhad dried at- the very oi-ntains.- it              e in -&#xD;
I dare say more than one among you kgW  hats ,to. be'm.love, my Lads,&#xD;
Here is Charley, for instance," and our hero gave a start ; " he, I imagine, can&#xD;
understand me."=%&#xD;
" Yes-yes !" again murmured the soldiery;- " we know it."&#xD;
" Yes !" he repeated somewhat scornully; all very well that, but different men&#xD;
have different ideas of love. Some are sensual and depraved, and with them.&#xD;
love is mere pollution and a mis-comprehension of the sublime passion ; and I&#xD;
have met with but few that could understand it. as I did, but it was with me a&#xD;
portion of life-of existence !&#xD;
" Yes, with me it was different ; she was a lovely little trusting flower, the daugh-&#xD;
ter of a very worthy, honest tradesman, who loved her like the apple of his eye ;&#xD;
but she was worthy of a throne, and I would have given her one. As it was I&#xD;
could make her, I thought-fool that I was'!-honored, great, wealthy. She is&#xD;
poor enough.now, and so am I!.&#xD;
" Our dream of love was delicious, but very brief. She eloped with me, and as&#xD;
the Lord God'liveth, I meant her no harm-for I made her my wife ;" he added&#xD;
this with a solemnity that startled the soldiers, who were not often moved by any&#xD;
strength .of expression.&#xD;
" Yes, she became my wife !" he continued.&#xD;
" Your wife !" ejaculated one or two of the men. " Thundpr and lightning, here,&#xD;
Dick, give us your hand, my boy 1" and a cordial grasp was given. ." We thought&#xD;
you trifled with the little child."&#xD;

"My parents heard that I had eloped with the child of a tradesman," the soldier,&#xD;
heedless of this, went on ; "and threatened the poor old fellow with'ruin "and&#xD;
annihilation. . It would not have taken much to have broken his heart, for it was&#xD;
half gone already; but what was done could not be undone ; and I thought iiy&#xD;
father and mother loved me too well to thwart me, and 'that 'I -had only to bring&#xD;
her home to give her another father and mother,:who would love her like her own.&#xD;
"I meant to have put her back into lis bosom, and said, 'Embrace your daughter,&#xD;
but also ;embrace my wife, and you can love her still!' but that day never came.&#xD;
I believed, however, tery firmly in it, and I was happy living in a little Eden of my&#xD;
own, far from the turmoil' of life, and expecting then my little baby hourly.&#xD;
" My parents prevented this," hel continued, after a convulsive pause, during&#xD;
which he drew his hand over his brow several times, as though things were crowd.&#xD;
ing into his brain, and confusing him with their multitudinous variety.&#xD;
" Yes, they hindered all. We lived in Wales at the time; and when my baby&#xD;
was born, and she put it in my bosom, and laid her own sweet little-head like a&#xD;
blossoming flower beside it,J1I-I prayed to God for her, for both, and loved thejin&#xD;
more and more. Then I made up my mind to return to my father's house.&#xD;
" One -day I went to my little home, after walking, or fishing, or something, and&#xD;
I-found her-gone-both gone ! Oh! then the sleeping devil within me -woke up.&#xD;
I learned from the' people of the 'hise that a stern man, and a proud, 'pale woman,&#xD;
richly dressed, drove up in a splendid chariot, drawn- by four horses, and carried&#xD;
her off-robbed me.of my wife and tmy child. This man-this 'woman; were my&#xD;
parents.' I travelled'night and day, and arrived at their house in town.&#xD;
" I demanded my wife ; they called her a designing, cunning girl-and they said&#xD;
something worse of her than I deuld bear, and I silenced them, and made them&#xD;
turn pale and tremble. I demanded my child.-" They knew nothing of either. I&#xD;
cursed them both, and quitted the house, never to return to it more.&#xD;
"I'need not tell you how long after, or by what means, I traced my Alice through&#xD;
stages of wretchedness and penury, till I found both mother and babe, my wife&#xD;
and child, dying on a mean pallet, in a parish woikhouse.&#xD;
"I could have, called curses from heaven and fires from hell to' avenge this&#xD;
immitigable wrong ; for what had this pale, crushed, tender dove done to win such&#xD;
an atrocious injury? But when I saw her pale, thin cheeks, and heard her moan-&#xD;
ing, and saw my wasted babe on the half1starved breast of the woman I adored,&#xD;
as devotees adore heaven, I stilled my soul-I shed no tears-I heard her utter a&#xD;
cry of joy and pain, and then the thin helpless hand wandered over my head, as I&#xD;
laid it, kneeling by her side in that horrible hole upon her breast beside my child.&#xD;
"Little Alice,' I said, 'little Alice, you and your sweet baby shall live here no&#xD;
longer.'&#xD;
"'No, George-no,' she said. Oh, her thin lips, how they trembled ! 'No,&#xD;
George, dear, we shall not live here long-not very long  qive me that brandy,&#xD;
my lad !" said the soldier abruptly.&#xD;
"iTo lose a parent,-to lose a mother one 'loves,-to lose a friend one is&#xD;
devoted to,-to lose a dog that has been your companion for years, is all painful;&#xD;
what was it to this ?" continued the soldier. "When I heard what she said I had&#xD;
a terrible foreboding of the future. Was it for this I had sought her? Was it&#xD;
thus my parents had shown their love? Was it to see her die that I had moved&#xD;
heaven and earth to discover her? If tears were rain, and not the bitter and acrid&#xD;
shower which scalded my face like a caustic, roses would have sprung to life around&#xD;
her dying pillow ; and that golden hair so dabbled-&#xD;
"'Tare my head in your arms, my dear George,' she said, faintly. 'Take my&#xD;
child in your arms, too. Kiss me-kiss the baby. You love us, do you not?&#xD;
God bless you ! God protect youI Do not separate us. Do not forget us. I&#xD;
Lhave borne much-but I loved you so dearly; and I forgive every one, as I hope&#xD;
to be forgiven !"&#xD;
The rough soldiers turned away, and one or two wiped their eyes furtively. A&#xD;
few sturdy but suspicious " hems" sounded niggardly, and they averted their face.&#xD;

"'$1 and onjy going before you,' shl said ; and I felt that she was speaking the&#xD;
truth. 'I am going before you ;-,clasp me closer, let me feel your lips ;-lift up&#xD;
my ;head,--put any baby's mouth oto mine-and-and so she died,,my lads ! and for&#xD;
an, hour after I held her baby in:my bosom till I felt it cold. It was dead, too I"&#xD;
There was-a ;long, deep, impressive pause, and again he went ,on.&#xD;
"They made my heart desolate, wrecked, and void; and I-I, in turn, desolated&#xD;
their household, and wreaked their :peace for fever. As they had. two passions to&#xD;
feed and fqster-.--be most boundless love for me,:their only child, anda pride; which,&#xD;
God forgive then, they 'dad also given to me, and the latter the greater, they sacri-&#xD;
iced me to that prideA .;Well, I trampled on their pride. -They knelt tome in i&#xD;
the 4i'st and ,ashes of hgrnility, and I scorned them. -They offered me a bride,&#xD;
the fairest in the land,.and Ilaughed at them. They could not give me little Alice,&#xD;
and I had nothing else to ask for. I had a grand funeral from that workhouse for&#xD;
my wife and child, ;and I put my name on her coffin-lid, and after that day I forgot&#xD;
1hat 1 had a name'or parents, :and I knew that I had avenged Alice, for their house&#xD;
is a house of mourning andthe world is to them, as to me--a sepulchre.&#xD;
"And this is the reason, ,ay boys, that I don't care for anything that comes or&#xD;
goes, that happens or that does not happen. !I want to be dead. I want to sleep, for&#xD;
ny eyes barn so that at night Idon't close them ; I only see little Alice;,my golden-&#xD;

trumpet wakes me up, and then I have only the bullet that hits me to look for. It&#xD;
has not come yet., but to-morrow. will have better luck ! And so hand me the&#xD;
brandy !"&#xD;
He tools a deep, deep draught, and a strong hectic "hue came into his white&#xD;
cheeks. The soldier s were deeply shocked, end their rude emotions made their&#xD;
hearts throb painfully in their-broad chests..&#xD;
"Ifnone of yog can match that story,":said the soldier, "go to sleep, and don't&#xD;
disturb me:; I am going to ream of my Alice-and her child agin;" and he fell&#xD;
back on his side, and apo rnfnl wind swept wailing by, as -if it had been the oice*&#xD;

Tirt hill reveile startled the sleepers. 'Fromn line to line ran the roll of the&#xD;
thrillinvdrums, and the whole army was Aroused from'the sleep of the long 'night.&#xD;
The men made a 'hasty breakfast on the ground, and folding away their great&#xD;
;coats, 'buckled them behind in their ruishal places. ' The lines were then :formed ;&#xD;
a~nd in an incredibly short space of timerthe whole British army was in Carms, and&#xD;
'with bounding heart;ready and waiting ifor the battle.&#xD;
'Then, while flags were'proudlyifloating in' the air;---while videttes'were hurrying&#xD;
to the heights where the commander-in-chief had posted himself,-while the aides-&#xD;
detamy were hearingg 'from post to post, bearing orders of the- greatest conse-&#xD;
quence,--while the impatient war-horse was champing his bit and pawing the&#xD;
ground,-then roseithe wild blare of the stirring 'martial music,,with that electric&#xD;
effect which transformshman, we know -not how or why, into something fierce, bold,&#xD;
and hardy enough to dare Deatb even, in'his own iron den.&#xD;
The wild magic adences th4t rang with such a fierce ?melody, and to which the&#xD;
beat of the hollow drum added an inspiration that was almost delirious, sounded&#xD;
cross the wide plain; and ever and anon thedeep slogan of the Irish regiments,&#xD;
as they ranto-batlle-eager,in' the'old-proverbial phrase of,'the Greek poet, "to&#xD;
grapple wit'h' g ory naked"-increased the excitement felt:by those who were' yet&#xD;
'standing on their arms, waiting ifor the word to go forwardrd"&#xD;
When 'the thrilling, blood~titring melody of the Scotch'bagpipe drove the light&#xD;
and limber mountaineer bounding like a buck on his native braes; and with eredt&#xD;
forms kindledcheek=and tfladhing ey's the  honts of their clans :re-echoed those&#xD;
of fang h-a-ballagh " and 4thewhole mingled in 'one huge human roar, when the&#xD;
fetartling3 "harrah 1" of the English soldier told that he too was going intofaction&#xD;
with a-'step as light as though he were. going to the dance; and:then one 'awful,&#xD;
reverberatingearthquaking roar told that the artillery had begun its destructive&#xD;
'work, and theybatle raged with =fury from end to end of the plain; while in a&#xD;
dense and iaiid ciiopy of smoke,'that sink heavily over the combatants; the sharp&#xD;
horrors of the atrife 'Were for a while 'obscured.&#xD;
The greaticannon soon did their work : whole battalions were swept down, yet&#xD;
their places 'Weie filled up wherever it was Necessary to concentrate men. And&#xD;
oolly on the heights Sat the 'commander-in-chief on horseback, glanding through&#xD;
his glass at the-progress of the fight, ordering 'the voids to be filled; the broken&#xD;
gaps again rendered*a fAlir and 'serried 'mass, sending men to take this position, to&#xD;
capture that batch of the foe, with as much compunction and just as quietly as if&#xD;
he were playing chess, and the enon he lost had as little blood or sense 'of pain in&#xD;
'them as those made 'of ivory.&#xD;
'The :cannon ceased after a while.; for those that were not captured were remov-&#xD;
'ed, or else aftera.vain effort, and the literal waste, of hundreds of dives, the .im-&#xD;
pregnablepoint was given up as',impracticable. Then began' the 'chargesiof the&#xD;
regiments of horse, hurling their weight of man and horse upon all in their way,&#xD;
as:though they were'the missiles forced from some' superhuman engine 'in {a. guise&#xD;
as'graddly terrible as fatal. The battle grew the deadlier and fiercer, when the&#xD;
bayonet charges were begun, for they now grew intermixed; were 'hand to, hand,&#xD;
or point to point; and the battle raged, and roared, and thundered, as troop after&#xD;
'roop :went madly en,--as sheet 'after' ssheet of. vivid flame was feilitwed 'by the&#xD;

&#xD;
they seemed to be borne on with a resistless force that nothing could withstand,&#xD;
till they fell in heaps, and choked up the way : and then the scene was more sick-&#xD;
ening, for horses brained dead men, and tore their limbs, and mangled their&#xD;
corpses. War, and Glory, and Death had a triumphant orgie in that field of car-&#xD;
nage.&#xD;
Charles has escaped as by a miracle. The youth whose story so moved him has&#xD;
been shot through the heart, and lies at his feet=with a face so calm and smiling,&#xD;
that he seemed to have at last attained the happiness life refused.to promise him.&#xD;
The name of "Alice"  ias the last breathed on'his lips : and Charles, had time to&#xD;
cast his coat over the boyish form; and to think of that love, stronger than death&#xD;
which he could have felt, but which the loved object refused to accord him.&#xD;
In that hail of death, officers and men have suffered severely, andt of the.first&#xD;
scarcely one is left ; so that the remnant-of.this slaughtered regiment is now added&#xD;
to another, and Major Freshville on horseback leads them on, His bright' blade&#xD;
gleams, and his noble horse bounds like a hunter over a;barrier-a barrier of dead&#xD;
forms.&#xD;
" Fo  ard; my lads 1-forward I" he cries, waving his -sword and pressing on:&#xD;
Char  on them !---hurrah !'&#xD;
And "Hurrah ! hurrah :hurrahl1" rings:triumphantly from the throats of the&#xD;
terribly excited men, who have stood for hours retaining, their post, and are now&#xD;
deciding the fate of the battle. They give .no'way, though cannon, andhorse, and&#xD;
foot-have been trying to oppose them. They give no way-and just. no*they are&#xD;
advancing. "'Hurrah 1";&#xD;
Major Freshville is a brave, but a rash. man. . He leads his companies into a&#xD;
fire which seems likely to annihilate them;; but hewill ndt go back. ",Forward !"&#xD;
is the-cry, and forward they go. A film comes over the 9yes of Charles, but it is&#xD;
a film of blood. He begins to feel the same tigrish instinct :moving in his own&#xD;
veins and arteries. He is being. carried away by the ardor of the fight. But&#xD;
Major Freshville is in danger.&#xD;
His horse-is shot dead under {him..  He falls in the melee. The bayonets&#xD;
ofY the foes, with a'dull jarring, grating sound, crash and clash, and, then find less&#xD;
resistance, and make far less noise, as they cleave and split the hearts of those who&#xD;
are to baptize their bloody points. From the bayonet to the stock, the musket is&#xD;
wet and red; and Charles is, fighting :like a gladiator over the body of the pros..&#xD;
trate officer, because his name is Major Freshville chiefly, and because he has re-&#xD;
cognized in him' the officer he met with Ellen on the day of their last, meeting:&#xD;
and even in the roar and amidst the slaughter, he- has time to think of this.-&#xD;
"Thabks,. my lad, thanks!" says the officer, who has been saved hy efforts the&#xD;
most tremendous and determined, and mountinga horse that was then flying. past,&#xD;
" Thanks'! if we live after the battle, come to me to my. tent ;": and setting his&#xD;
spursinto the noble -animal, on they.go again like a whirlwind.&#xD;
Three times did the-battle seemlost and won. Three times had either side ap-&#xD;
peared to giveaway, but they rallied-together again, and seemed' determined to die&#xD;
where they were rather than retreat. The great plann is wet, but it is not the&#xD;
rain of the spring, nor the dews of the summer night. Little rills are running&#xD;
about; and ,joining others larger, deeper, wider,. till the rills are a river. But the&#xD;
river is not 4a 'river of water,-it is river of blood l'Out of that sanguine irri.&#xD;
'gation, 'what fruit shall grow? what rank'weeds thrive?. Not corn, or pastures, I&#xD;
trow.&#xD;
TIhe regiment went into the battle nine hundred strong ; nine hundred bright,&#xD;
blazing bayonets, and not enough were- left in Charles's' division to make 'up three&#xD;
companies: Well-might a soldier call the slaughter most graphically a ".butcher's&#xD;
bill."            .&#xD;
The battle was fought and over. The arm of slaughter was wearied. It was&#xD;
a "-glorious victory." It led to other fields of fight, more butchieries, but also to&#xD;
"glorious 'victories" in .succession!&#xD;

T   E cock-pit of the Harpy was on more than one occasion the scene of many&#xD;
revolting spectacles; such groans and shrieks were wrung, by the "very intensity&#xD;
of pain, from the lips of men to whom the fear of death or the dread of a wound&#xD;
were things little heeded. Some there might be found in the "'sick bay," this ship'9&#xD;
hospital, where the doctor and his assistants -work like butchers in a sham les,&#xD;
cutting up joints-some with broken limbs dangling by the skin, others with the&#xD;
intestines torn away, others again, with part of the face shattered; and, after a&#xD;
battle,a warm reek of human blood would issue from that hideous butchery ; a&#xD;
mist,'hot and clinging, would rise, vapor-like, from that gory chamber, which would&#xD;
have filled a spectator with horror and loathing. What can be imagined is other=&#xD;
wise unutterable.&#xD;
It was Edward's turn now to submit to-one of these accidents of battle, which&#xD;
only missed a vital part by the merest chance ; for during one of those actions&#xD;
which almost daily took place, he had' been struck down beside Jack Pipes, to the&#xD;
great horror and concern of the latter, who, stooping down, said,&#xD;
"How now, bo'? Not hove down yet, I hope, eh ?" and taking the flaccid hani&#xD;
of the bleeding youth, he bent down his head anxiously to see if he was really&#xD;
dead or had fainted ; but Edward neither spoke nor opened his eyes.&#xD;
"I'd rather have lost a limb myself," said the seaman, with great feeling; " fca&#xD;
a braver heart, nor a better fellow, never broke biscuit. Here, Sambo White !*'&#xD;
he added, turning to a 'gigantic negro who stood beside the gun which had just been&#xD;
discharged at the enemy, "lift up his feet, you woolly angel, steady and gently.&#xD;
Bear a hand! 'Out" of the way there, you clumsy lubbers !" he sternly added,&#xD;
address ug a.,couple of seamen who were about to stumble against them. " Steady&#xD;
Sambo'- you nigger--"&#xD;
"Sa abo am steady," returned the black, with an air of offended dignity.&#xD;
"Sam},o am no nigga. He colored gempleman, sar !" and with a very slight&#xD;
exertic q of his tremendous strength, he tenderly bore Edward towards the nouth&#xD;
of the cockpit, while Pipes -assisted, bearing Edward's head and shoulders undet&#xD;
his var t hands, and down, delicately asian infant, they carried him.&#xD;
" N ane of that, doctor," Pipes suddenly -exclaimed, as the surgeon was about&#xD;
to ue his horrible-looking instruments for the amputation of Edward's arm, which&#xD;
had leen shattered ; " no -meddling with the lad's flipper. Sink me; if I don't&#xD;
think. 't's unchristian to go cutting, and slashing. and sawing so. If you'll be so&#xD;
good ir, as'to lash a tourniquet round it, I'll answer for his recovery all the&#xD;
"Pihaw !" was the impatient exclamation of the surgeon who had become blunte&#xD;
by onany harrowing scenes." "Pshavl the arm is'too hopelessly injured ; how-&#xD;
ever, if you think you can save him, do so--I shall not hinder you' ;" and he&#xD;
turned away abruptly..                            .     ..           ,&#xD;
" lere, Sambo, my son ; for, after all, your blood's red like my own, and your&#xD;
bmart's in the right place ;-here, Sambo 1" said Pipes, his eyes moist and dim.&#xD;
" May I never drink another can, if I-don't-think the heart of'the doctor there is&#xD;
m hard as a capstan or a cannon-ball. Just take my bandanna off, will you, darky ;&#xD;

splinters along the broken arm, the degro tied them up, and soon the arm was&#xD;
securely bandaged, and then obtaining for Edward a sleeping draught, Pipes had&#xD;

young man fell into a long, deep, sleep, from which he awoke refreshed.&#xD;

and corner, of the English seas,'had fought. a ozen battles, and once.or twice had&#xD;
put into a foreign port to  'refit, to get stores, and sometimes to leave tokens of&#xD;
esteem inthe shape of- fire and sword, in an, enemy'scountry ; and during all this&#xD;
time Edward had not heard from Rose, from home,, nor from his brother ; and&#xD;
there, were times when his 'heart-grew sick, and his hopes sank, at the probability&#xD;
that time and death,, absence; and. forgetfulness, might. break for ever those ties&#xD;
which had been so very dear -to mhim.&#xD;
The Harpy had;in obedience to orders, left her Mediterranean station, and was&#xD;
carrying despatches=of some consequence to Sierra Leone, so that now she was&#xD;
running down the African coast with a. favorable wind, occasionally obtaining&#xD;
sight,of the dusky shores where some branch of the formation of the 4tlas chain&#xD;
lifted, up itsdusky and stricken brow to the fervid rays; of the sun, .or towered&#xD;
aloft, sublimein its tranquil grandeur, as a pinnacle jostling with the stars. f&#xD;
Edward wad pow in anew element, breathing a strange atmosphere. He had&#xD;
left: the blue waters, the soft breezes, the azure skies of the..Mediterranean, and&#xD;
was now in a torrid, zone, where in the deadcalmfof, a day, whose sky was a can-&#xD;
opy of copper, hot as an oven, suffocating and enervating, he saw a sun in the sky&#xD;
that burned with such fierceness as, to any one incautious enough to, brave it,&#xD;
would strike.a deadly fever to the brain: with a single ray.,&#xD;
They were' cruising among shoals, and bars, and. blights, and Watching suspi-&#xD;
eious Spanish and French craft with low black hulls,.thatwere engaged;in the slave&#xD;
trades at the mouths of rivers. They breathed thspdeadly, air of waters where; the&#xD;
dense vegetation- knitted and. intertwisted overhead,: rotted and, rotted in the&#xD;
water, which, as it.flowed. on, stirring up the stagpant slime, where noisowue and&#xD;
deadly thingsdurked, and the savage and the serpent,co4pned together with the&#xD;
poisonous exhalations of a most infernal climate, to attack thewhite man, to ar-&#xD;
rest the progress of his daring spirit, to limit his step, to kill him in every con&#xD;
ceivable way, and by .fevers. of' every ghastly kind.&#xD;
The Harpy had. tradsacted business'.at SierraUeone, and having taken on board&#xD;
a considerable quantity of ;gold dust, the captain, in pursuance of instructions reT&#xD;
ceived from the government1,proceeded again for sea, and a rumor spread, through&#xD;
the brig that they were in search of a notorious.Spanish pirate slaver, who, under&#xD;
the command of a, daringcreole'-of Brazilian extraction,;had defied all the cr-&#xD;
sers on. the coastforalong.time past. The reputationof. this lawless: rover for&#xD;
seamapslip and hardihood, was' coupled ;with ,characteristics of a darker nature;&#xD;
It was statedthat he;had committed.the most wanton:cruelties-; that whole crews&#xD;
had been compelled to walk the plank. If there happened to be any females, on&#xD;
board any of the vessels so unfortunate as to cross his path, they became hi4&#xD;
property,.or, a. prey to the bxutalities of his crew, So horrible were the deeds&#xD;
Ieilad done, that a. determined effort.was decided upon: for the extermiatuon of;&#xD;
this .band of marauders, and a the duty of doing- this devolved uppn ,the  arpy'&#xD;
whose crew calculated upon a princely share of prize money,;'&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
A CRUISE IN A LAiQOON.&#xD;
Tu Harpy was hugging the shore under easy sail, on the banks of the Quorra,&#xD;
peeping into those innumerable creeks and hiding-places which alkcund at the,&#xD;
entrance of African rivers ; but not a sail was visible. At last they happened to&#xD;
enter into a vast lagoon, which they had not yet explored, and where the fantas.'&#xD;
tical tropical scenery, the-singular beauty of the broadening waters, the blinding&#xD;
sunlight which ;dashed- upon it, and the great numbers of' verdant islets, that, like&#xD;
pictures in a dream, appeared and disappeared, tended to give a sort of drowsy&#xD;
attraction to a scene more' beautiful than anything ,dward had hitherto seen ;&#xD;
and holding his breath with delight, he. glided' with his buoyant- vessel over the,&#xD;
magical depth of those marvellous waters, rather realizing. some illusion of the&#xD;
fancy than being concerned in the barefact of every-day life.&#xD;
Clustered in groups beneath the awnings, the men were assembled upon the deck,&#xD;
anxiously discussing the subject of their cruise, and holding, as many different-&#xD;
opinions upon it.&#xD;
"Here's the place, howsomever; to, meet 'Yellow Jack' " observed a grizzled.&#xD;
seamen: "for in the most beautiful corners of these 'farnal lagoons,;you goes to'&#xD;
sleep in warmth and sunshine, and wakens, with slimy damps all over you, and&#xD;
then down you go,-a few hours raving, and shark 'and alligator finish up the&#xD;
count.: That's the way to tottle up an African cruise."&#xD;
"Well, for my patt, we shall have better fun, I hope,. messmate," said a light&#xD;
and agile boarder. " I have heerd that in same of these black. craft, besides a-&#xD;
pretty good lot of gold dust, there's a good haul of dollars and Portugal pieces to&#xD;
be found snug in the 'tween-decks. But avast !-what have we here ?"&#xD;
All at once a sort of small village appeared at the extreme end of the bay, and on&#xD;
a strong' and' rudely-constructed fort the yellow flag of Spain floated proudly.&#xD;
Primitive as was the architectural style of these houses, all built of .timber and&#xD;
matted in, here and there evidences of cultivation were to be seen in fields and.&#xD;
wellestocked gardens ; and the breadth and extent of some of the- structures- indi-&#xD;
cated a station of sonie importance. It might, be a mere trading depot for ivory,&#xD;
gold dust, and palm oil.: It might, however, be the head-quartery of a slave&#xD;
merchant. The captain and crew of the Harpy had the more reason-to believe this&#xD;
from the bustle they witnessed' among a group of persons ashore, and from. their&#xD;
having seen, from aloft, the tapering and. raking mastsof some craft from among&#xD;
the trees, which appeared, however, to remain in perfect security among those&#xD;
"keys " and retreats,, mostly inaccessible, and known only. to those- who had. be.&#xD;
come familiar with them, when engaged: in their nefarious, traffic, or in escaping.&#xD;
from the hot persuit of a king's' ship.a&#xD;
" I say,'Danvers,"'said the captain to his lieutenant;"it strikes me that we are&#xD;
on the ,trail of this creole cut-throat. Take the boat. and go ashore, with. my&#xD;
compliments to the governor, and if he; is curious to know what brings us here,.&#xD;
tell him that we want fruit and' water, and some provisions, but not a hint-as to&#xD;
what we really seek."&#xD;
" Aye, aye, sir-;" and the lieutenant, touching' his. lat, was lowered with 'his,&#xD;
boat, as the brig saluted the Spanish flag, which the fort returned in compliment;&#xD;
to the ensign of St George, that hung. listlessly over the' taffraiW;gand bending&#xD;
to their oars, the rowers, in their neat frocks and broad-leaved hats, and neat black&#xD;
belts, in which cutlass and pistol were stuck, pulled to a rude jetty, and followed&#xD;
by the coxwaine, the officer advanced tona, sentry and asked to see the governor.&#xD;
"Don Jose--yonder," said the sentinel, pointing to a long low building surround-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
A NIGHT ATTACK.&#xD;
&#xD;
ed by a verandah. The officer went in the direction indicated, and his observa'it&#xD;
eye beheld a range of log huts, such places as he had heard slaves were packed in&#xD;
previous to their being bound and stored on board ship, and he did not for a mo-&#xD;
ment doubt but that he rambled through the streets of one of those demoniac colo-&#xD;
nies devoted to the pursuits of the slave trade, and prepared to defend the&#xD;
iniquitous traffic with their heart's blood.&#xD;
The governor, a bloated; ruffianly looking Spaniard, surrounded by his council&#xD;
of half-a-dozen armed men, who looked more like the crew of some pirate than a&#xD;
decent municipality ought to look-areceived the officer with a sort of bullying&#xD;
civility that was as disagreeable as suspicious. The desire . for frmts, water, and'&#xD;
provision-the last in the shape of pigs and poultry-was granted ; and two or&#xD;
three times that the brig's boats passed to and fro sufficed to, complete an arrange-&#xD;
ment that was rather intended as a blind than otherwise ; and the lieutenant hav-&#xD;
ing mastered more than Don Jose, the liquor-loving governor, would have desired,&#xD;
returned on board the brig, ;that again stood for the mouth of the lagoon.&#xD;
Among these half-dozen of mien Lieutenant Danvers had observed around the&#xD;
council-table of the undignified looking governor, there was one whose striking'&#xD;
appearance excited his curiosity in a peculiar degree. - Tall, commanding, young,&#xD;
and eminently handsome, with=curling, odorous locks, a silken moustache, an eye&#xD;
that had a satanic gleam in its intense depth, and a smile that was as fascinating&#xD;
as a woman's, but which, when it writhed under a sense of irritation, had a wither-&#xD;
ing and bitter curl in its inexpressible menace. He wore a costume of barbarian&#xD;
elegance, half oriental, and his feet were clad in boots of buff-colored, Spanish&#xD;
leather. Pistols richly mounted were in a silken sash, and the handle of a yata-&#xD;
ghan *as prominently displayed. He wore superb ear-rings, and rings of great&#xD;
value decked his fingers. , A singular air' of deference was shown towards him,&#xD;
and the lieuterant, by putting "that and that together," as the saying is, came to&#xD;
the conclusion that he stood in the presence of no less a person than the creole&#xD;
pirate, or slaver captain, himself. From this arose another conviction, namely,&#xD;
that the tall and raking masts of the vessel they had seen so slily hidden among&#xD;
the trees, were none other than those of the swiftest sailor that had ever on that&#xD;
coast hitherto given the slip to all that attempted her capture.&#xD;
This stranger thus spoken of was curiousin his questions, speaking in a hun-&#xD;
ga franca which Danvers knew, and which is more or less known on all foreign.&#xD;
coasts ; and while asking a variety of questions that might give a clue to the true&#xD;
reasons that brought a brig-of-war to so unusual a spot, and pretending an utter&#xD;
ignorance of nautical matters himself, gave it out that he was sailing in a Spanish&#xD;
trader (which his uncle commanded,) and that he stopped on shore with his friend,&#xD;
the governor, while the trader made a stretch down the coast, to speculate a little&#xD;
farther in the business which had brought them to this quarter.&#xD;
All this failed in mystifying the lieutenant, nor did it deceive the captain of the&#xD;
Harpy ; and accordingly they set down the whole of the handsome senor's unasked&#xD;
communication as so much irrelevant matter that was to be read in the reverse&#xD;
ratio. By this time the- brig had gained the opening of the lagoon ; and bringing&#xD;
her to, they cast a couple of anchors, attached to buoys, ready to be slipped, and&#xD;
impatiently waited for the night to fall.h                            t&#xD;
"Do you think, master, we can surprise that fellow who plays such a pretty&#xD;
gameS at hide-and-seek, out yonder ?" said the captain to his old favorite and,&#xD;
teacher.'r&#xD;
1 Ayeaye, yer honor,-I'll engage it," was the answer. "A. couple of boats,&#xD;
well manned and armed, and 'I'll back my warrant against a biscuit the task is&#xD;
done."&#xD;
" Pipe away the boats, then," said the captain.'&#xD;

A COUPLE of the brig's boats, with some twenty men in each, seamen, marines,&#xD;
and offices, all. well armed, provisioned for twenty-four hours, with rockets and&#xD;
signal-lights, the crews filled with expectation, were shortly after proceeding with&#xD;
.muffed oars, beneath the dense shadow of the mangrove bushes on anisland shore,&#xD;
and through a channel which had not yet been explored, but which these fearless&#xD;
men ventured into without hesitation. Edward was in one of the boats, but&#xD;
Pipes, much against his wish, remained, with the others, on board. The lieutenant&#xD;
commanded one, and the sailing-master:the other.&#xD;
Strange was the aspect of land and water, and the depths of air around them.&#xD;
The lucid heaven of the tropics, filled with zodiacal lights, broadened above with&#xD;
an expanse and depth not observable in other latitudes. Monstrous and sometimes&#xD;
terrifying exaggerations of palms, mangroves, and trees of.huge girth and growth,&#xD;
-lifted up their proportions on the shore ; while the water, first clear as light itself&#xD;
grew gradually thick and turbid ; and as the darkness deepened, the were con-&#xD;
pelled to pull farther out in the almost tideless stream of waters, to avoid the&#xD;
snake-like roots and twisted stems of enormous creepers, that suggested huge and&#xD;
horrible serpents, and then the,putrid exhalations that rose up in a pestiferous&#xD;
mist became as sensibly felt as seen. There was something revolting about the&#xD;
whole.&#xD;
" Baccy is the best thing for these here fever damps and fogs," observed a&#xD;
seaman, as he turned a quid in his cheek. " Something's alleys wanting in these&#xD;
cussed whereaways."&#xD;
"Take a cigar, Mr. Spurrel," said the master to a midshipman who sat beside&#xD;
him. " What old Tempest, here, has just said is quite right ;" and the cigars were&#xD;
lighted. "Pull away with a willI" he suddenly exclaimed. Do you think the&#xD;
Harpy's boats were meant to be buoys, stuck in the middle of an African creek,&#xD;
for a slaver to make fast to ?"&#xD;
The quick, stern tone of the command acted upon the men like an electric shock.&#xD;
The long, steady strokes of the rowers were just as before, but it was evident that&#xD;
a strength ran from the arms to the very blades, by the greater progress made.&#xD;
" Look out a-head there for a light," continued the master. "These fellows,&#xD;
secure in their hiding, I guess, will be hanging out as many lamps as if the craft&#xD;
was lighted up for a ball-room, just the same as though we were in port, and the&#xD;
war time over. That's it, men ; that's it. Can an  of you see Mr. Danvers's&#xD;
boat ?" he added, peering into the moist, dank darkness.&#xD;
"No sir, no," several voices murmuringly replied. " I think, sir, as the leeft'&#xD;
nant's taken the other leading of the stream," suggested another.&#xD;
"I hope we sha'n't get separated, though," said the master, somewhat more&#xD;
quickly. "What's that? Rest on your oars, men. Mr. Spurrel, your ears are&#xD;
young, sir. Just construe me those noises if you can."&#xD;
With the muffled oar-blades dripping on either side of the boat, the men one&#xD;
and all listened with an intensity that increased, and even grew into alarm, as un-&#xD;
accustomed sounds, that now stormed the senses, suspended the very pulsations of&#xD;
the heart, and gave to the darkness, the mystery, and the deadly atmosphere that&#xD;
encircled 'them, a kind of awful charm.&#xD;
The sound which rose so clearly upon the ear was that of a dull, drumming&#xD;
noise ; and so continuous, so regular, and so monotonous was this sound, as to&#xD;
convey only the most disagreeable sensation 'to the listener. At intervals, and&#xD;
conjointly with this -noise, arose that of mingled laughter and shrieks, rendered&#xD;

somewhat indistinct by the distance, but rendered at the same time with such&#xD;
clearness, that there was no possibility of mistaking this for the babble of waters,,&#xD;
the sighing of the woods, or the cries of wild animals. A superstitious man would&#xD;
have said that the devils were holding revelry, or that the natives were at some of&#xD;
their unhallowed rites, which came to precisely' the same thing. Whatever it&#xD;
arose from, the result was, that a nameless terror struck the men, whose whispers&#xD;
indicated to the master the fears that beganto fasten on them.&#xD;
"Give way, my lads," said the master. "It grows cold, and I should like to&#xD;
warm. myself aboard the slaver. Together,.and with a- will!", and once-mord the&#xD;
boat shot away, while' the master, thinking. some explanation, necessary, con&#xD;
descendedto give it, and:sodissipated some of that nameless-dread, while they felt.&#xD;
"I know what it is," said the master; with a shudder. "'I once heard it before,&#xD;
when a younker on the Bonny river. Some of the black fellows are cannibals-&#xD;
that is, they eat each oter.-"-.:&#xD;
"The onnatural brutes ," exclaimed the strokesman, with an oath.&#xD;
"Exactly so, Master Tempest," assented the master. "You wouldn't like to&#xD;
eat a slice out of your messmate-never mind which-don't look about for the&#xD;
tenderest-tougher than powdered beef, any one of them, and tarry too---"&#xD;
" I'd rather eat a chain cable, and pull the bolts out of the brig with!-my teeth,"&#xD;
responded the sailor, with a grimness: of disgust and horror that raised a laugh,&#xD;
and so dispersed the rest of the terror the men-at all' times superstitious-had at&#xD;
first felt.&#xD;
" Well," resumed the master, "that's what they're at now. One tribe has had&#xD;
a battle with some other tribe ; and the conquerors are going to- have a feast&#xD;
They'll sell the prisoners-to the trader, andfthat's what the slaver'shere for=--"&#xD;
"There,,my lads, look !" exclaimed an oarsman, involuntarily.&#xD;
An opening appeared between the high and sheltering trees which sloped to the&#xD;
water-side. In the-middle of thisopening a huge fire blazed up, fed. by pine-wood,&#xD;
and kept constantly supplied. Above this was something like a- scaffold, and&#xD;
appended to flesh-hooks, suspended over this blaze, were three or four mutilated&#xD;
human beings, some'of which might even yet be alive.. A thrill of fear once more&#xD;
ran through the seamen.&#xD;
The sound of that horrible drum added to the sickening features of this scene&#xD;
of blood and barbarism. Scores of men, with wild yells, danced, and capered,&#xD;
flitting between the spectators and the light, like so many spectres--like so many&#xD;
fiends, rather-for their naked, forms, their fantastic ornaments, their yells and&#xD;
screams, the drum still monotonously sounding, the .leaping flames, the victims&#xD;
hung, and cut limb from limb while yet alive,-allthis combined to create a scene&#xD;
which might have suggestedan idea of pandemonium.&#xD;
Far across the line a boat full of men was seen pulling and the'tracery of the&#xD;
slaver became visible.-&#xD;
"One can hardly think that these brutes canbe worth the blood and the money&#xD;
they cost," muttered the master. , " Qive- way there, men. I'm sick!--I should&#xD;
like to drive into them with a.howitzer- --"&#xD;
" Boat ahoy, there!" hailed a man- at the. bows&#xD;
"Aye, aye 1" continued the master, half' apart. "I thought we should get- to&#xD;
Danvers before long. - Isappose he's been looking at this pretty sight. hail him&#xD;
again, my man."  This was done.&#xD;
"Hoi !-.hoil" was:the hesitating response, in a tone, an accent, and a language&#xD;
so different, that his suspicious were aroused at once.&#xD;
"Zounds !" exclaimed the master,-" zounds:and-the devil! that's not Danvers's&#xD;
boat. I say, Master:Spurrel, there's a- screw loose here.; and I'll wager a button&#xD;
that the smart scoundrel has a suspicion. Egad I it would; be conical enough if&#xD;
we were both of a mind;and while we are looking, for the slaver, for the crew of&#xD;
the slaver to pluck up, the impudence to board the brig. Look to your arms, my&#xD;
men.-and, corporal--"&#xD;

"See if it isn't the Eddystone, you- booby," growled the officer, who had already&#xD;
beheld the- twinkling' of a lamp far over the surface of rippling waters : the light&#xD;
from which came soft and silvery towards them. The effect was as exquisite as a&#xD;
pature-a picture soon to be;changed.&#xD;
"Corporall" said'ithe impatient master.&#xD;
" Yes,,sir-a" replied,'the corporal, who hd:a party of marines under his care.&#xD;
"1Just speak to that boat, will you, by firing a musket over his head. I should&#xD;

Hurrah ! here we are alongside. Now, my lads, one Britishcheer, and up you. go&#xD;

As the cheer rent the air, however, a sheet of flame broke from the side of the&#xD;

THE   HAR.PY s1,R)ISED.&#xD;
THE iHarpy,.shrouded by-darkness (but so secure in her. watch and armament&#xD;
a 'ainst surprise, that the idea of an attack never for a moment entered into-the&#xD;
mind of either her commander or of-Jack Pipes, who had-the look-out forward)-&#xD;
the Harpy was-rocking quietly on the sluggish. waters: .Glooin-the, dim gloom&#xD;
from.that terrible miasma -reeking upward from stagnant waters, and rotten vege.&#xD;
nation, hung' above her: 'A battle lantern or two-threw a light n the decks, and&#xD;
afew meny clustered here and 'there in groups, formed shadowy picture in the&#xD;
obscurity, to, whichthe-imagination would have given a strange animation.&#xD;
The officer of the watch, cigar between-:his-lips; promenaded the white, quarter,&#xD;
deck; thinking-of home, and friends,.and drawing his night jacket: tighter round&#xD;
him, as he felt the pernicious damps strike him.. The captain was = below in his&#xD;
cot. One or two of the sails hung in motionless festoQus from the yards; A few&#xD;
men on the/:forecastle wee smoking their pipes, spinningfarns,, or drowsily&#xD;
shivering in'the bitter'cold of a-tropic night, such as congeals the marrow, in those&#xD;
terrible African:creeks and: rivers.&#xD;
Pipes was walking to and fro, accompanied by Sambo White, and taking his&#xD;
station by-,one of -the-cat-heads, refreshed hitnself by a puff, or two of his short&#xD;
dudeen, while listening-to the negro's reminiscences of his past life.&#xD;
"And so you were aIprince-eh, Sanibo ?" he said,&#xD;
"A prince in my own 'country," said - the stately black, stretching out his hand&#xD;
towards the land, which forest and jungle hid from: view, and speaking in that&#xD;
broken dialect peculiar to the African; "and .1 had 'warriors, and councillors, and&#xD;
I led men to battle, till one day-" A spasm crossed his face, and he .waspsilent.&#xD;

nearly scuttled the slaver, tdo," he' added, sententiously, "but they found it out in&#xD;
dirne."&#xD;
me"Hem !' said Pipes, who was puzzled in what 'manner to receive this latter&#xD;
information ; and whether he ought not to reprehend a man who conceived the&#xD;
atrocious desire of scuttling a ship,'and drowning the crew, whatever they might&#xD;
be.&#xD;
"IUallo ! what makes that warp quiver ?" exclaimed Pipes,'whose hand was on&#xD;
a turii taken round the bitts, and finding in this a relief from his perplexity, he&#xD;
peersdinto the shadows across the waters of the lagoon, and in a whisper that was&#xD;
short and stern, added, " Sambo, give a squint here ; your eyes are better than&#xD;
"Natives ! boats !" said the negro the next moment. "They are the enemies&#xD;
of my people ;" and his sharp teeth glistened. "They have two boats full of white&#xD;
"Stand by, here !" said Pipes; ' my lads, bear a hand, there's going to be a&#xD;
scrimmage. Pikes and hatchets !"-and, as a dozen of the brig's crew leaped up&#xD;
to the bulwarks, Pipes ran aft, and conveyed his suspicions to the officer of the&#xD;
watch.&#xD;
"Call the boatswain!-pipe all hands !" said the officer ; " beat to quarters !"-&#xD;
and the shrill call of the boatswain, followed by the sonorous cry of " All hands on&#xD;
deck !" and the sharp rattle of the drummer's call, woke the ship up from lethargy.&#xD;
The officer then descended into the cabin.&#xD;
"TWe are surrounded by a crew of savages, and the slaver's boats, sir," he said&#xD;
to the captain, who sprang out of his berth in a second, and who, donning his&#xD;
dressinggpown, seized h sword and pistols, and was on deck in a second, followed&#xD;
by his officer.,sw&#xD;
The ienrwere at their posts. Every eye was on the alert, and bent anxiously&#xD;
out on the waters. Not a thing could be seen. Not a canoe-not a boat-not a&#xD;
human being. Were these the creations of fancy ?  Neither Pipes nor Sambo&#xD;
were much used to dreaming with their eyes open; and all this time, as the men&#xD;
with light steps leaped to their posts, the silence of death,-ominous enough, per-&#xD;
haps,-reigned around them. Where, then, and who were the dreaded foes that&#xD;
th reduced crew of the Harpy had to do with?&#xD;
Pipes rubbed his eyes, spat on his hand, and griped his cutlass. "If these ben't&#xD;
the devil and his imps, Sambo, they're pretty much like them. They say old&#xD;
Davy is king among these cannibals, ttoo.".&#xD;
They are clinging to the chains," said Sambo. " They are mounting the side,&#xD;
now . Get some shot ready to drop !" Still, and all breathless and expectant, the&#xD;
crew from one end to the other, waited. As yet not one foe was visible.. Sambo's&#xD;
whisper had, however, ran round, and reached the ear of the commander.'&#xD;
The captain bent over the side; and beheld a worried mass of black forms, lightly&#xD;
leaping out of the spectral canoes and boats that had so far evaded the watch as&#xD;
to have made themselves fastnalongside, and a flush crossed his angry cheek.&#xD;
There was insolence as well as deadly murder in that attack.&#xD;
"Ready with the iron," he whispered. "Heave, men, heave !-let fall " and&#xD;
crash, and splash, the metal fell, breaking almost every boat. -"Run out the guns !&#xD;
-fire !" he added, loudly.&#xD;
The fire ran round the brig, but little mischief was done by the discharge. This&#xD;
was succeeded by a horrible yell-a murderous, sanguinary cry ; and black men&#xD;
and white, -armed with all manner of hideous weapons, leaped on the bulwarks,&#xD;
and began to cut, and thrust, and hack with demoniac shouts. No disguise needed&#xD;
"Into' the sea with them, my men !" shouted the captain. " Don't -spare the&#xD;
rascals ; use pike and cutlass, aiid leave the guns 1"&#xD;
&#xD;
What light there was now for the ghastly strife, besides the one or two lanterns&#xD;
at the poop, arose from the pistol shots that were fired with deadly effect, and by&#xD;
the sparks which the steel of the combatants gave forth as they crossed and met ;&#xD;
and the desperate condition of the aggressors, whose numbers, their cries, mingled&#xD;
with oaths, and the darkness Maggerated(certainly, man to man, they doubly out-&#xD;
counted the.crew of the Harpy) the loss of their boats, or canoes, and the know-&#xD;
ledge that they had no quarter to expect, rendered themas formidable as dan-&#xD;
gerous. In fact, such audacious attacks as these, where there was no lack of a&#xD;
certain reckless daring, was calculated, generally to carry the aim intended.&#xD;
So furious, therefore,-and on the whole, so unexpectedly overwhelming was this&#xD;
night's surprise,,that the savages had gained the decks, and the armed 'crew of the&#xD;
slaver, forcing the blacksto bear the brunt, of ;the first resistance, that though the&#xD;
latter, were slaughtered i- misses, the slavers,, as yet, had experienced but little&#xD;
harm. Between the twofires the savages began to confuse.the melee, and, as the&#xD;
crew of the brig: gathered themselves.in a firm and compact mass,: and gave way&#xD;
to the first rush, the cool bravery, the steady front, the thorough. workmanlike&#xD;
style in which the. men-of-war's men wielded their weapons, neither yelling, nor&#xD;
blaspheming, nor gesticulating, that they began 'to change the aspect-of the fray&#xD;
and the blacks were beginning to be driven overboard by a well-directed charge&#xD;
of pikes, seconded by the seamen's small arms ; and here, too, the marines on- the&#xD;
quarter-deck began to thin the numbers of the pirates'that had as yet made good&#xD;
their footing.                ; .&#xD;
"You circumventing jackanapes, take that !" said Pipes, parrying of the blow&#xD;
of the sweeping scimetar, and in turn making his cutlass bite deeply into the skull&#xD;
of his foe. 'You; come and catch, weasels asleep, does you?  Go it, Sambo, my&#xD;
prince ! Shiver my:top-lights, that's walking into them !' for wieldinig'a handspike&#xD;
with all his enormous strength,,the African felled the three, or four that were&#xD;
within reach of his'-tremendous lever; the resistless swing with which it; cleared a&#xD;
E lane" for his shipmates to follow,.being fatal to those whom the heavy weapon&#xD;
struck.&#xD;
The fate of the battle, however;. was .likely to go againt the Harpy and her&#xD;
gallant crew, when the sound of,.a :gun was heardI and a cheer that restored hope&#xD;
to the panting captain and his men, Who fought with the greatest,.gallantry,&#xD;
announced that help ws at hand. The crew replied to this cheer with a heartily&#xD;
good will, andrenewed, their exertiotn to 'the great chagrin of the slavers, who&#xD;
saw that they had but one chance' left them. . This ;they were preparing for.&#xD;
The masts of the slaver slowly made their appearance in the tortuous waters of&#xD;
the lagoon'; and asi the flag. she wore was:down, and the Union Jack floated at her&#xD;
gaff, the prize thus betrayed itself., IMeantinme a boat, one-of the Harpy's, manned&#xD;
and armed, was. also seen;approaching, and the master, grim as a Triton, and&#xD;
evidently meaning mischief, was seen: in the stern animating his men.&#xD;
"Hurrah . cried the captain: " hold your ground, my men ! One charge more,&#xD;
and the decks are' clear !'r and the last despairing chance was hazarded, with an&#xD;
increase of fary, and fire, and;slaughter.&#xD;
"Fight, amigos! fight, you'fends !" crieda voice, which.Danvers, as he gained&#xD;
the side, knew to belong to the handsome looking reprobate he had net at the&#xD;
governor's, and who was thecaptain of the slaver.&#xD;
" Ydm fight with a rope round your:neek !" and at the instant, Edward grappled&#xD;
rith the slaver captain..&#xD;

LET us now see how matters proceeded onboard the slaver, who, better prepared&#xD;
for the reception of the harpy's boats' or keeping better watch, 'had opened a fire&#xD;
on the boat in which the mastercommanded with such fatal results 'as to kill three&#xD;
or four, and wound others. :But tliere was 'this lieutenant and his boat in the&#xD;
meantime ?  Of that, nothing could be seen, and there, was neither time nor&#xD;
opportunity for -consideration or "the solving of'a'Aonbt., .It was every man for&#xD;
himself; and, in turn, the boat's.crew of the briig were 'on the decks, and making&#xD;
good their footing on the slippery planks.  .&#xD;
" At them, you bull-dogs l At them, Harpy I"" shouted the master; speaking&#xD;
wrathfully, and mingling blows with his curses.&#xD;
The attack was, however, in favor ,of the than-of-war's men, who -drove the&#xD;
greater number of the laver's crew below ; but despite their weakened amount of-&#xD;
men, owing to theirdeaptain having headed some fifty;desperadoes at hour before,&#xD;
in order to make an attack upon the brig, there was still a numerous body to&#xD;
oppose them.&#xD;
Edward, who had fought fiercely in the first batch that 'went over the sid ia&#xD;
happened-to pass the master. " Harkye, my man," said the latter'; "just press&#xD;
forward, and cwt away' the hawse and warp, Or whatever 'she be fastened with.&#xD;
Take an axe,'and-do your wpork like 'mat. Do oyou," he continued, as Edward&#xD;
rushed forward, and addressing a couple of nimblestopmen,'"'do you sheer aloft,&#xD;
and loose, the fore-topsail ; thats;my sons,"-wand downlhe:sprang off-the forecastle.&#xD;
"Mr. Spurrel, sir !" he continued, while using both cutlass and pistol, " make your&#xD;
way aft, at any cost ; keep her head to the-wind, as .he gathers way ; hug it, sir,&#xD;
as if--take that, you buccaneering rascal!-'hbg it, sir, as if it was your&#xD;
sweetheart ; and--who's got the blue light?"  2&#xD;
"Here sir-here!" replied the coxswaim.&#xD;
"Send it up, and let's see what sort, of gentry'wehave to deal with., By heavenly&#xD;
they're signalling themselves -howsomever  " and, as he spoke, with an unerring&#xD;
aim, he levelled his pistol at ,a wildlydressed ruffian,iwho, busied with a chest' at&#xD;
the foot of the',mast, had'just sent up t-arocket that illuminated'the 'savage picture&#xD;
of strife, and cast a fierce redglareonthe ship.' rThe astounded combatants,.sur-&#xD;
pised for, a moment 'by the =unexpected 'light1'paused Ito gaze on each other, and&#xD;
calculate their probabilities, disadvantages, and' so- on. ' The ; man so selected by&#xD;
the master fell dead On the 'deck. ..'&#xD;
'rhe blue lightof the Hay at the same inst At went whizzing upward, and the&#xD;
livid glare so soon succeeding the deep crimson of the flashing rocket, gave' all a&#xD;
hue still more startling, till a cry from some of the Spanish crew drew attention&#xD;
elsewhere.&#xD;
For a moment the combatants beheld each other ; "and the quick eye of; the&#xD;
master, and the midshipman, the stern order, the noiseless bustle.of the brig's best&#xD;
fighting-men, who, with tightened belts, bared cutlasses, and pointing pike or pisto,&#xD;
showed how they were equipped for the nght,-detected what advantages were to&#xD;
be derived from this momentary "light thrown on the subject."&#xD;
"Drive 'em below, or overboard !"  s'ted the master, leading on his men to&#xD;
where the slaver's crew, with savage faces, and threats still more ferocious, made&#xD;
a stand. " Hurrah ! mv sons of thunder-down they go! Batten the hatches!"&#xD;
The fight was renewed, but a lurch given by the slaver showed that Edward had&#xD;
succeeded in cutting the hawsers, and the vessel, as she bent over to the light&#xD;
breeze, was brought to thE wind as had been directed ; and then allowing the sail&#xD;

&#xD;
to fill, the battle was half fought, and the victory almost won. Still, the rovers,&#xD;
brought to bay, fought like maddened wolves.&#xD;
" I think, sir, they're going to bring their black chaps out to eat us," quoth&#xD;
Tempest. drily. " If they makes a drill of me, I'll be -:--"&#xD;
" What's the =matter ?" said the master, interrupting the expletive that was .on&#xD;
the tongue of the panting tar.&#xD;
"There goes the goigs, and yonder's the canoes. Shall I point this gun, and&#xD;
Jet drive at 'em ?" he added, with a grin.&#xD;
"Yes, yes ! Throw up another light there&amp;amp;, coxswain," replied the master.. " I&#xD;
wish to heaven the boat 'would come up. Rally round here, my lads. One more&#xD;
charge---and,.coxswain, lets have a light E 'Blaze away 1"&#xD;
" Aye, aye, sir" responded the coxswain, and again the light, like a Lucifertah&#xD;
star,-stood a moment inr the heavens, burst, =broadened, and cast a phosphoric&#xD;
effulgence, with an effect that would have been admired in a pyrotechniam display.&#xD;
At present, there was no time for applause.&#xD;
"Now, at 'em--one, and all. Down, or into the 'sea !" A deafening shout,.a&#xD;
rush of men, the clash of steel, the sharp rattle of pistol-shot, and the next moment&#xD;
not a Spaniard was to be seen on the decks.' A dense mass of-canoes, beyond&#xD;
couut, were then seen putting off from the shore, and stealthily skirting the bushes,&#xD;
in the direction of the Spanish prize.&#xD;
To-their great joy, from behind the thick foliage rose the gleam of another blue-&#xD;
light, and faint sounds of approaching 'cheers were also'heard-those cheers which,&#xD;
given with that hearty good-will that characterizes the English seaman, whether he&#xD;
is going into the battle or out, going to a wreck or to assist his friend, always give&#xD;
such a fervent encouragement to those beset 'by peril.&#xD;
"That's Danver's boat," exclaimed'Spurrel, rubbing his hands joyously.&#xD;
" Now, Tempest, my man, take care, and don't waste the shot," broke in the&#xD;
master, curtly. "Hit the niggers ; for I guess, if the murderous savages can hit&#xD;
any of us, they will. Wait for the word."&#xD;
"Kill and eat us all," added Sambo White, with a brevity of style and manner,&#xD;
that, backed by a knowing nod, expressed no two opinions on the subject on his&#xD;
part, at least.pi&#xD;
With those horrible cries, that so frightened Robinson Crusoe, as also many&#xD;
other hapless creatures who have been menaced by the ferocious savages ill fortune&#xD;
at any time cast them among, the floating phalanx, as if certain, of success, or un-&#xD;
conscious of danger, came boldly on.&#xD;
The flotilla was almost abreast of the vessel, and closing in as a discordant war-&#xD;
whoop rose. It was clear enough to the meanest capacity, that an instant massacre&#xD;
would have been the doom of those on board ; and the master gave one of his grim,&#xD;
dark smiles, as he heard the cry, and glanced from the gun towards the advancing&#xD;
foe.&#xD;
" Fire !" he said. " Let them have it !" and for an instant his fierce nature,&#xD;
aroused by a sense of the peril they were in, knew no mercy.  Fire ! Tempest-&#xD;
fire !"&#xD;
The iron agent, of death delivered its deadly message in a sheet of vivid flame,&#xD;
and the roar of the cannon was echoed by the sharp, shrill cries of pain and torture,&#xD;
by the crashing of the canoes, and by the hissing and plashing of the water that&#xD;
was ploughed up in all directions by the frightful missiles. Simultaneously the&#xD;
Harpy's boat came alongside, and Danvers and several of his crew leaped on deck,&#xD;
and a few hurried words and a few cordial grasps were interchanged.&#xD;
Just then, a seaman came to the lieutenant, and said, " Please your honor, them&#xD;
fellows below are kicking up a pretty rumpus-they're trying to get at the&#xD;
magazine---"&#xD;
"The deuce !" exclaimed the startled master, seizing a musket, and, poininng it&#xD;
down the hatchway in the direction of some menacing sounds, he fired without&#xD;
further hesitation, and was answered by a groan and a cry for mercy from those of&#xD;
the slavers who had fled below.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Mercy, eh ?" growled the officer ; " half-a-dozen of you men go below and see&#xD;
what they're after. Report to me at once, and let a couple guard the magazine,&#xD;
for I suspect they, have a pretty good supply of powder to blaze away with."&#xD;
This command was obeyed (the savages, as many as were left, having dispersed,)&#xD;
and it turned out that the extreme resort of the master had.,been needed, for aifew&#xD;
of the most desperate had actually cut through the bulk-heads, and the smoking&#xD;
match was trampled out within a yard of'the magazine door. The captives were&#xD;
then securely chained, plenty being at hand, and the brig now became the subject&#xD;
of anxiety.&#xD;
"I expect the Harpy's .in danger," said Danvers. " I saw some boats passing&#xD;
in the distance, and heard a musket. It strikes me,.a part of the gang mean to&#xD;
attempt her.".&#xD;
".Eh! just what I thought," replied, the master. " Well, we must out boats,&#xD;
and make these slavers pull. Two or three fellows with a brace of pistols can keep&#xD;
'em at it, and a man to steer in each. We must tow the craft I suppose, and keep&#xD;
her on with what sail thisdeadly-lively air will lend us. Piff ! warm work, this,&#xD;
eh, Danvers ?"                                                ,&#xD;
" It is. I'llgo in the first boat, and leave you to manage the craft," and down&#xD;
he descended.&#xD;
" Very well !" said the master, and called out aloud, " Pass the hawsers forward!I&#xD;
Aloft, there ! Let fall the t'gallant sails !- So! she begins to feel the breeze."&#xD;
And thus they came up to the Harpy at a critical moment.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
T HE SLAVER - PIRATE'S       DOOM.&#xD;
By the time that the battle-lanterns of the Harpy'were lighted up, and the decks&#xD;
blazed as with an illumination, showing them incarnadined with blood, while here&#xD;
and there groups of bodies, with ghastly wounds in them, were strewn about in&#xD;
heaps, dying where they fell,-by this. tine, the brig had been cleared of the&#xD;
savages, the slavers all dead, drowned, or prisoners, the vessel of the latter was&#xD;
alongside, and yet a desperate hand-to-hand fight, in which neither one could&#xD;
receive assistance, was continued between the gaily-dressed captain of the slaver&#xD;
and Edward. The former knew but too well that he fought with a rope around&#xD;
his neck, and the mad thirst .to be amply revenged, and to do as much evil and&#xD;
mischief as he could, raged in his bosom, nerved his arms, and, though bleeding&#xD;
from a dozen wounds, to exhibit a strength and a ferocious tenacity that might&#xD;
have commanded admiration but for the vile causes these passions espoused, stil,&#xD;
with a fierce smile, he -continued to ply Edward.&#xD;
.Active and agile,. skilled by this time in the use of his., weapon, bold and quick&#xD;
of eye, he was yet no match for a man whose strength was that of a gladiator,&#xD;
whose mastery of every point of fence amounted to an accomplishment not easily&#xD;
rivalled ; it is therefore no wonders that Edward gave way before the flashing&#xD;
Damascene blade. which the rover wielded. To all cries to yield, he only laughed&#xD;
his bitter laugh of scorn. lHe had already slain some, and desperately wounded&#xD;
several with his own hand ; and some of Edward's messmates were closing round&#xD;
him, with the intention of disarming him, when, with a bold sweep of his glittering&#xD;
sabre, Edward's cutlass flew a score of feet out of his hand, and the next moment&#xD;
would have been his last, had he not-in retreating stumbled, while, in so doing, the&#xD;
rover's blow fell short, and, meeting no resistance, so embarrassed him as to bring&#xD;
him on the deck, when, seizing Edward by the throat,.the fight became like that&#xD;
between two, bulldogs, neither of -.which will let go while there is still left the&#xD;
smallest power of holding fast. Edward put forth a strength not weakened by any&#xD;
previous wounds or loss of blood, and heightened by the imminence of the-peril&#xD;
which surrounded him, but to little purpose ; while the dark and handsome face of&#xD;
the rover, distorted by hatred and revenge, with fiery eyes and frothy lips, glared&#xD;
before him. The left hand of the ruffian was on his throat, and the 'right hand&#xD;
stealthily drew a stiletto, that, like an asp, glided out of his breast, and with its&#xD;
deadly.point seemed to menace;the unlucky. Edward. He thought of home-his&#xD;
parents-Charles-and his beloved Rose, and a silent prayer was uttered. The&#xD;
blow was, however, stayed.&#xD;
"Hallo, my hearty ! Sharpen your knife elsewhere ! Odds bobs ! my messmate's&#xD;
ribs are not intended for any such sheathing as you seem to count upon ;" and with&#xD;
a gripe of iron, Pipes-who had just stepped over the gangway-seized the&#xD;
murderous arm, and gave it such a twist as extorted, a groa-n front tne now captive&#xD;
captain,-while the murderous weapon fell on  the deck. Following up his&#xD;
advantage, despite the. blasphemies and struggles of the baffled foe, Pipes held his&#xD;
arm, lustily calling out, "Bear a hand with the. darbies, there, armorer; this fellow&#xD;
will jump overboard, and turn intosa shark, if he's not fast. Soh 1 belay all that ;&#xD;
and now you may ease your mind with a bit of swearing, if a prayer for your&#xD;
sinful soul is of no use." Turning round, then, with an air of indifference as to the&#xD;
hereafter of the ,rover, Pipes helped Edward upon his feet, saying : "Well, Ned,&#xD;
bo', how is it with you now? What cheer ?"&#xD;
Queer, Jack, queer. I was nearly done for ; and I owe my life, as well as a&#xD;
limb-ad---.'&#xD;

" Stow that. Come down below, and let's have a can of grog. I see ; it's pipe&#xD;
all hands. Lord ! what a tussle we've had. By all the fiddlers in Portsmouth,&#xD;
we've got a prize-"&#xD;
"A. prize !" echoed two or three, who overheard him.1&#xD;
"What, you've unplugged your ears, have you ?" isked the sailor, with an ironical&#xD;
grin. "Well, yes. That black craft--and aclipper she is too--is well stored&#xD;
with--"&#xD;
"With what, Jack Pipes ?" demanded an impatient sailor.&#xD;
"About forty or fifty of the:prettiest black armlets you ever sett eyes on---&#xD;
and this Pipes accompanied with'a knowing wink.&#xD;
"Armlets !_ what, in thunder, are you driving at now?1&#xD;
" To hold niggers with, in the slaver's hold," said Pipes."&#xD;
" Pshaw !" ejaculated the other, walking away in disgust-speedily diffused&#xD;
however, by the orders to "Splice' the main brace !-grog ahoy !"&#xD;
" For all that," whispered Jack, as he went down with Edward, she is a prize.&#xD;
There's more gold dust and stolen plate aboard than would give ev rf man of us&#xD;
his six months' pay, prize and carouse, after the captain and officers had taken&#xD;
their whack."&#xD;
On examination of the slaver's vessel, it was found that though her cargo of&#xD;
living ware had not been completed, sufficient were found chained in ier unhallowed&#xD;
hold to constitute a lawful prize, and to condemn her in court according to law.&#xD;
In her cabin', however, was found a victim to the rover captain's turpitude, in the&#xD;
shape of a young nun, who, having been beguiled from her convent, had by force&#xD;
and fraud became the victim of his passions ; and such a story of horror did the&#xD;
dying creature relate, as moistened with the human dews of sorrow  he eyes of the&#xD;
captain, his. chief officers, as also those of the, Harpy's chaplain, and the 'more&#xD;
callous-hearted doctor. The captain, thertefdre, determined to put as many men&#xD;
on board the slaver as he could spare, and despatch her, with her treasures, to&#xD;
England ; while he took the rover to Sierra Leone, to be tried for piracy, slavery&#xD;
murder, and a lono catalogue of crimes, not only proveable -from the Idepositions of&#xD;
the dying Spanisi nun, but from others on board, who had been forced, from the&#xD;
fear of death, to join the desperate crew, and who were now ready to bear witness&#xD;
against the ruffian upon oath.&#xD;
aAmong those selected,; from their bravery, their, good dispositi n, and for the&#xD;
dpendd ce which could be placed upon them, were Edward and his 4ld friend Jack&#xD;
Pipes; and by noon the next day, the prize, commanded by Danver ,accompanied&#xD;
als by the brav little Spurrel, parted from the Hlarpy (and the fearful African&#xD;
coast) with joyous cheers, the one setting sail for England, and the other still&#xD;
lingering for a while on the spot.&#xD;
The trial- of the magnificent bravo (for such he was;) a spoiled, desperate prodigal,&#xD;
was not dzelayed. 'Thle same ease, but accompanied by such ribaldry ,and fearful&#xD;
mockery, the same bravado, the same contempt for captors, ju lges, death, and the&#xD;
future, marked hin throughout his trial as had characterized him before. As his&#xD;
life had been, so was his death likely to be; for when the ug story of a short life,&#xD;
and the episodes of his crimes, were detailed, the, sneer of a-demon was on his hand-&#xD;
some lips.&#xD;
When, however, he was sentenced to be hanged for piracy, &amp;amp;c., according to&#xD;
British laws, then the full-vedom of the fiend broke out. He cast himself upon his&#xD;
guards, and dreadfully mutilated one; he bit, and. wrestled, and tore like a wild&#xD;
beast, and when he had necessitated:thd strength of half-a-dozen men, having literally&#xD;
disabled six others to mastei- him, a horribly unnatural calm fell over him.&#xD;
"Hang me '--me with the blood of an hidalgo in my veins-never !"&#xD;
And- disappointed justice-earthly justice, at least ; for the following morn-&#xD;
ing, when his gaoler went into his well-guarded and carefully-examined cl, ther&#xD;

to lie peculiar to- men of the class to whom he had attached himself. This wa&#xD;
often resorted to in order tobaffle the last exaction of the law.&#xD;
We must now return to Charles, whom we left on the field of battle, among the&#xD;
wounded and the slain, and where the vulture ande the wolf,.and the robber of the&#xD;
dead, appear simultaneously.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
THE NIGHT OF THE-BATTLE.&#xD;
THE "night after the battle" must suggest momentous matter,-must be fraught&#xD;
with vast changes, affecting friends and foes, homes, hearths, and altars,-the&#xD;
people and the state,-to neighbor nations as well as foreign foes,- the immortal&#xD;
as well astthe mortal. Where is the;bounding strength, the bold manliness, the&#xD;
elastic nature, tried in field and fray, that turned back at nothing.? Where is the&#xD;
herculean -framie, the intellectual 'brow, the frame of Apollonian! grace, the reckless-&#xD;
prodigal, the hoping, half-despairing lover? What has become of the pomp and&#xD;
aiusta       o    oruswar, wen masses, ithe sunshine of the golden morning,&#xD;
youtirrus  attl trumps, hte theosound of martial music, leaped to battle as&#xD;
youths-ruish to play, as men hasten to meet the. belyed ? Where are the cannon,"&#xD;
thehorsemen) the serried phalanxes, the brilliant staff, the cool old officers the&#xD;
wary generals, the plumages, the banners? Al'aihdbod       ons    age&#xD;
heaschare  ragnet,   ,roenwah n dAll vanished :.bloody mounds, mangled&#xD;
heaps, charred fragments, broken wheels, dismounted cannon, overthrown baggage&#xD;
and other waggons, dead horses, dead men ; dying men, with wolf, and ,vulture,&#xD;
and human devils murderously marching beneath the moonshine-that is all left.&#xD;
All left for you, aged parents  at home, who will no more behold the pride of&#xD;
your old hearts ; all that is left for the, pale maiden, that droopeth from the day&#xD;
the news of that deadly battle arrives; all left for friends and relations,' brother&#xD;
and sister, except the mourning you have to wear for the dead, and the sombre gap&#xD;
that is deep in each heart ;-all, all that is left-and, alas ! what a mere handful&#xD;
of ashes is this all!e e    '      '&#xD;
Long and level lies 'thep lain, with its sinister and unequal line marked on the&#xD;
horizon. The pale, weeping moon mounts up,-with a splendor that seems dimmed&#xD;
with tearful mists, and it reveals here and there such sights of horror, as, detailed&#xD;
in words, would shock and horrify. Here man and- horse, in furious charge fixed&#xD;
midway by the fatal shot, have fallen, and rolled, and never stirred more. Here&#xD;
some, hall~stripped corpses lie,.because there, are wretches- who prowl about the&#xD;
field, like vampyres, and, with unhallowed appetite for plunder, strip the dead.&#xD;
Here are broken wheels,and yonder a dismounted gun-carriage ; here a startled&#xD;
steed, neighing' for his. pale, rider and bleeding to death, utters perhaps his. last half-&#xD;
human cry, " startling the ear - of night."  Yonder, horrible ,and obscene, is the&#xD;
wolf come to the prey that he smelt afar off. - Down the air, rushing like something&#xD;
fromnplat o laclouds,comes the vulture, seeing and scenting prey from high.&#xD;
From place to place soon echoes the hideous scream, and the more hideous howl&#xD;
and bark of the wolf,.while  break and jaw drop gore. fIt is:a frightful carnival&#xD;
night; and there is light  cast down on the whole from fulgent moon andsstars.&#xD;
And over that field among the dead, besides wolf and vulture and the sacrilegi-&#xD;
ous robber of the slain-the murderer of the wounded as yet not dead--there&#xD;
wandered wailing women, seeking for the corpses of those they loved, or hoping&#xD;
with all the strength of their souls that they might be found, evendifs_&#xD;
eyet livin. They boie tears, and. held, and solicit ou nd a edene beond h&#xD;
ravenous enemy, no matter whether mnan, beast, or bird, and they saved a life at a&#xD;

&#xD;
moment when it would seem forfeited to the fates ; and that life was theirs ever&#xD;
after ; and with what right no one that lived'or loved, or has, been in peril and&#xD;
near to death on a stricken field, can question.&#xD;
A strong, brutal form might have been seen kneeling here and creeping slowly&#xD;
there, moving from place to place the cursed ghoul!1 busily engaged n striping the&#xD;
dead. He wore the loose Cossack breeches and a hideous fur cap. His shaggy,&#xD;
red beard, the evil glassy eye, the bare arms, the sleeves, tucked up, butcher-like,&#xD;
for free action, were stained with blood. In his hand he carried a heavy wooden&#xD;
mallet ; brains, and blood, and human hair were clotted on it. Valuables, swords&#xD;
spoils of slain men, were in his girdle. A huge wallet, swollen into a sack, was&#xD;
slung on his shoulder. This had been a brave harvest to him. The wretch came&#xD;
with the wolf and vulture, and the three worked well together : each took what&#xD;
he wanted, and all were satisfied,&#xD;
That flitting forn which Charles had observed from the watch-fire,-the phantom&#xD;
that _his imagination had converted into Ellen's face and shape,-was :in reality&#xD;
the poor, devoted girl herself ; who, by dint of almost incredibl exertion, had&#xD;
discovered the regiment to which Charlesbelonged, and which, in fact,-was com-&#xD;
manded by her own relative, Major Freshville (to whome she, had not ventured to&#xD;
reveal herself) ;;and from a distance, with a depth of devotion that was the grea-&#xD;
ter from her former neglect and coldness, she- watched over him ; willing, if possi-&#xD;
ble, to do him some real service, ere she dared to claim from him al remembrance&#xD;
she could not but fear had been obliterated by her insufferable coquetry. It is not&#xD;
necessary to explain how she crossed the seas, followed the track of the army, and&#xD;
hovered upon its skirts on the field, and penetrated its very heart, ason the previ.&#xD;
ous night. A little money, aiding the generous devotion-of a womat,-who, when&#xD;
she is devoted and determined, can overcome everything,-had brought her in&#xD;
safety and honor. Assuming the office of nurse, among others, which the exigen-&#xD;
cies of the war necessitated, she became attached to the company in that capacity ;&#xD;
and thus, on the night after the battle, she, too, was traversing that drenched plain,&#xD;
with far different purposes to the creatures we have enumated ; and having&#xD;
known that her lover was not found among the survivors, she set forth on her&#xD;
perilous and almost hopeless errand, determined that while she could stand she&#xD;
would search ; and, failing in that, would lay herself down to die,-the only atone-&#xD;
ment she had in her power now to make.&#xD;
She sees the form of the stealthy assassin going among the dead. She had&#xD;
heard the murderous blow, too ; and, passing groups of sobbing women who have&#xD;
found their dead, some internal instinct tells her that yonder, too, her own Charles&#xD;
lies low, and that the form over which the wretch is bending 'must be his. She,&#xD;
hastens onwards, just in time; and, with a shriek, she goes betwen the victim&#xD;
and the brigand, who. for atmoment, shrinks back appalled,--the w iite form looks&#xD;
go like a 'spirit. She glances upon the prostrate form, and recognises Charles in&#xD;
an instant..                                                         .&#xD;
" Spare him! he lives ! he lives !" she exclaims, and is on her kne  beside him-&#xD;
With a horrible execration the man recovered his courage, and hi brutality was&#xD;
only stimulated from his having been at the first moment frustrated and startled as&#xD;
by a shadow.&#xD;
"Out of the way !" he said, grinding his teeth, and menacing.&#xD;
" Mercy ! if you be a man,"-she cried."&#xD;
" Get out, youfool-! What signifies to the dead ? Consume you! do you want&#xD;
the plunder for yourself? Ah1 by thunder! we'll have no shares here. Out of-&#xD;
the way ! All !- all!--1'll have it all "&#xD;
A pistol lay at the ruffian's foot. The man was lifting up his frightful weapo,&#xD;
and the glaring wolfish eyes emitted rays of such diabolic fury as f oze her blood.&#xD;
A pistol lay at his foot ;-with a blind impulse she-seized it,-loaded or not, she&#xD;
knew not ;-she pointed it at him. iluis villain was none other than our old&#xD;
acquaintance, " Slip-the-wind."                             ,,&#xD;
He laughed hoarsely ; it was like the 'croak of a bird of prey. '~ 11l brain you&#xD;

fire seize you, for a meddling fool---" Whether the pistol was cocked or not, she&#xD;
did not know. The same instinct made her point it to him, and her inexperienced&#xD;
finger found the trigger. The weapon had fallen from the grasp of a dismounted&#xD;
dragoon, who' lay under his horse, and it was both loaded and cocked ; she drew&#xD;
the trigger desperately.&#xD;
"All!" she said: "take all!"&#xD;
With the report was mixed a hideous cry, oaths, blasphemies, and shrieks of&#xD;
pain ;' and the ruffian fell, his bowels torn to rags with the discharge. As Ellen&#xD;
sank, half-fhinting calling upon her lover, and clasping his head to her breast a&#xD;
party of mounted soldiers come up, and one descended at her cry. She fainted&#xD;
on hearing that Charles still lived. In half-an-hour, while life still lingered horri-&#xD;
bly in the mutilated form of "Slip-the-wind," he was fighting with wolf and vi-&#xD;
tare: but they had their prey.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
DEvoTION REWARDED.&#xD;
"CoNDUCT us to Major Vreshville's tent," said Ellen, faintly; "I have a matter&#xD;
of great consequence to inform him."&#xD;
" This poor boy had better be. taken to the rear, so that' the doctor and the&#xD;
nurses can attend upon hiim," suggested one of the patrol.&#xD;
" Yes, yes-you are right," assented Ellen. "Take him-I'll go with you; but&#xD;
I must see the'major, too. Be very tender with him; he is-he is-wounded I"&#xD;
"Well, I'm going to the tent with some reports," said a dragoon, good-humor-&#xD;
edly ; " so come with me, my pretty one ; and as for the lad-he's a sweetheart of&#xD;
your's, for a guinea. Eh, my lassie ?"&#xD;
Ellen blushed through her pallor; but with an impressive firmness, and sonie&#xD;
courage , she said, pointing to Charles," He is all the world to me !"&#xD;
" Why, bravely said," observed the trooper, pleased with the frank acknowledg-&#xD;
ment ; " and, for your sake, we'll take him as tenderly as an infant. And so, my&#xD;
lads, hoist him on my horse, and I'll hold him in my arms; he's not 'so heavy. So!&#xD;
that will do."&#xD;
And thus Charles was carried away tenderly enough by his strong, rough-limbed,&#xD;
gentle-hearted friends ; and Ellen was about to follow the:soldier towards the tents&#xD;
that now rose white in the moonlight, when she hesitated, and as Charles was be-&#xD;
ing borne away, she turned round, and advancing towards him, seeing his pale and&#xD;
inanimate face resting on the brave soldier's shoulder, she said, 'No, with him&#xD;
first-I must tend him !"&#xD;
"As you like, my girl," returned her proposed guide. "You will find no diffi-&#xD;
cultyin seeing the major, if he's not badly wounded-I hear that he was hurt ;&#xD;
dud so God protect you ! Good bye, comrades !" And with a cordial salutation they&#xD;
parted, the clear moonlight revealing fresh scenes of awe and terror, of devoted&#xD;
love, and of ghastly murder and death.&#xD;
Charles was placed in a bed in a large commodious tent, set apart for the sick&#xD;
and the wounded; and Ellen, aided by the surgeon, had the satisfaction of seeing&#xD;
him revive, and of hearing the medical officer say that, though desperately wound-&#xD;
ed, he would survive-maimed, injured for life, it may be; but as it was, thete&#xD;
was room for her to be thankful,-and Ellen was, for the first time in her life, per-&#xD;
haps, really so. He lived, dreadfully wounded in the breast-every sear in front!&#xD;
He lived ! that wyas quite enough.&#xD;
Follaving the surgeon, was a soldier belonging to Charles's regiment. "Ahi 1'&#xD;
he said, " there's as brave a fellow as ever shouldered a musket ! The say he's done&#xD;

prodigies of valor to-day ! I believe it ! I know him well," continued the man ; " it's&#xD;
Charley Palmer, of Major Freshville's company. -Why, he saved the major's life&#xD;
in the battle, so I heard-it was in everybody's mouth--"&#xD;
The surgeon .had beard how the young: soldier had been found, Turning to&#xD;
Ellen, he said, "He will have cause to thank you. You have saved the lifg.of one&#xD;
all speak well of  "'&#xD;
Saved his life!1 What words for Ellen.! Here was a claim on her lpver's affection&#xD;
at once. But that this lover should also have saved her uncle's, an' fficer, influc.&#xD;
tial-so her fancies ran-this~constituted for her a right to ask his interposition.&#xD;
What she had determined on doing' on her own account, she would now do. fQr&#xD;
Charles; and thus she quitted the tent, and crossing the field, by gu rd and picket&#xD;
-and the same silent picture of death and'desolation, of life and hope, now ming-&#xD;
led with these elements also-she sought the tent of her uncle with feelings too&#xD;
full for utterance, and yet she had a touching tale to tell. Wht if he were&#xD;
too disabled to hear her?&#xD;
It was easy to find the tent.  That was -not the difficulty. Cound she find the&#xD;
major ! One moment she stood hesitating at the entrance after the sentry had&#xD;
permitted her to pass ; the next, she had lifted up the folds of the tent, and was&#xD;
beside his bedstead-now used sofa fashion-exclaiming, "Uncle ! dear uncle ! pity,&#xD;
and .help me !'&#xD;
The wounded officer had been dozing upon his camp-sofa, his bruised arm band-&#xD;
aged, and his military cloak flung over his fine form; and it was  ith an air of&#xD;
amazement, as if startled by the appearance of an unexpected form-4-the idea that&#xD;
the sense is deceived, and confounding .the remembrances of past events with the&#xD;
present-that he beheld Ellen rushing in, and calling upon him for pity and help.&#xD;
"Ellen !" he exclaimed-" Ellen-Freshville, is this you ?"&#xD;
"It is-it is indeed ! I  "&#xD;
"Good heavens ! I can't comprehend it ! What does it mean ? What does-&#xD;
But no, I must be dreaming ?" and he drew his hand across his eyes like one who&#xD;
would disipate a vision, or concentrate the wandering faculties on a graver point.&#xD;
"Stop !" he said, half rising, and drawing his cloak about him ; " stop a moment ;&#xD;
I am quite confounded. Now-now tell-me all--"&#xD;
"Ah !" he exclaimed, when she had told him of the fervid, love of the carpenter's&#xD;
poet son,-when she had explained to him the deep sincerity, the truth, the hones.&#xD;
ty, and stedfastness of his nature, and had shown the black and blurred spots in&#xD;
her own vain character-those faults she had seen when it was dreaded that sorrow&#xD;
and repentance came too late-" So, this, then, is the youth whose heart I saw was&#xD;
in agony when you met him so lightly by that lonely stile, and. who, scorned and&#xD;
contemned, offered a life to his country, when you refused his heart. You have&#xD;
done a bold thing, Ellen. You have done even a reprehensible thing. You, a&#xD;
young girl, to leave your home, your old father in solitude and terror ! Wilful and&#xD;
wayward ; if there was not, after all, something heroic in your own devotion, and&#xD;
that this wounded soldier was worthyy of your love, I would move no step in the&#xD;
matter, but have you-sent home."&#xD;
"I do not go without him," she said in a low but determined voice. "Where&#xD;
he goes, I will go. Where he lodges, I will lodge. H  Ile shall be to me all:I hope&#xD;
for or desire, wounded, sick, dying, or dead. If he will take me, hfs home is mine,&#xD;
his father mine, his country, his God mine, wherever over the world he may here-&#xD;
after wander.'&#xD;
"ChildI child ! how you talk," began themajor,&#xD;
"Pardon me, 'dear uncle," she said; " if I have done wrong, I have sought to&#xD;
repair it. I owed him an atonement ; I hope I have rendered it. He himself has&#xD;
claim upon'you:-&#xD;
-" A claim !-upon me 7"' ejaculated the officer.&#xD;
" Yes, for in the battle to-day he saved your life."&#xD;
SI .know that a brave .young man did so," said Major Freshville, eoinewha*&#xD;
-surprised.&#xD;

T.H,E TWIN    BROTHERS.&#xD;
"It is he ! it is my Charles !" cried Ellen, eagerly.&#xD;
" My Charles !" echoed the other, smiling. "Upon my' word, you are going on&#xD;
at a pretty rate, Miss Ellen. However, if it be really he, he shall not lack a friend-"&#xD;
"And I, uncle-" said the hesitating Ellen.&#xD;
"Why, as for you, troublesome baggage 'that you are, you have shown that&#xD;
there is in your nature something more.than the mere impulse of girlishness ; so&#xD;
that if I take care of the one, I must of necessity do the same for the other-"&#xD;
"Oh.!how shall I thank you !" cried Ellen, tears of joy and-gratitude overflow-&#xD;
ing her eyes.&#xD;
o not thank me yet. But," he added,, in a changed tone," your position&#xD;
must be changed-your. garments-your. oice-c-&#xD;
t han nothing uncle, I implore you.!".she said. "Let me be still the nurse--&#xD;
nurse  There are not many women in the camp, and there are&#xD;
not.many men in lghospital-alas4 too.many lie on the plain."&#xD;
"Yes !,I know that full well," iepied the major, in a tone of deep feeling; "still&#xD;
this must be arranged. I can send you to Lisbon,.and,"he, also added, "there you&#xD;
will meet my wife ; 'and for the rest, hope that soon you and your lover shall be-&#xD;
hold England."&#xD;
Why dwell upon the joy, the delight, the rapture which filled the bosom of the&#xD;
poor invalid, when he found that the devoted nurse, the heroic woman, that had&#xD;
saved him in battle (and who unconsicously had avenged on the person of "Slip-&#xD;
4he-wind" the outrae which had robbed.him of Edward), that now, with tears&#xD;
and prayers, begged to lje forgiven for herpast scorn' nd indifference, was none&#xD;

saves a life is raised up to an equality  with it, let his former station be ever so&#xD;
low; but there was intelligence of soul and good yeoman's blood in Charles's veins&#xD;
which rendered him something more than a   ymere pasant.&#xD;
w3y the influence of the major, Charles was despatched to head-quarters with other&#xD;

THE TWIN. fROTlBE.K*&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
THE BURIAL       AT SEA.&#xD;
THE sailing qualities of the Spanish slaver were such as to astonish Pipes, whc&#xD;
clung tenaciously to the prejudice of his race, viz, that nothing could beat English&#xD;
oak and canvass, manned 'by British tars, whether in sailing or fighting ; but he&#xD;
was forced, with some chagrin, to acknowledge that the Bonita was a clipper that&#xD;
could hold her own with the Flying Dutchman, even, and sail right in the wind's&#xD;
eye.&#xD;
They were, however, unlucky enough:to fall in with a portion of the thannel&#xD;
squadron when almost within sight of'port, and less than a day's sail from it ; and&#xD;
as the enemy was out in great force, a general engagement was appre ended, and&#xD;
was indeed .sought for eagerly on both sides, French as well as English. The&#xD;
Bonita, therefore, on joining the fleet, received additional guns, men, and officers.&#xD;
A chaplain was also added ; and, for the'time, the slaver's vessel became a regular&#xD;
man-of-war, and had her station assigned her in the fleet,.which had now a stately&#xD;
and formidable apearancefally arrived. The ene  hove in sight, and the eager&#xD;
vessels, like majestic birds of rare and wondrous plumage, with steel talons and&#xD;
fiery throats, prepared to meet each other. The decks were cleared of all that was&#xD;
likelyto incommode the men at their guns. The cabins had their bulk-heads&#xD;
knocked away. Guns were' run out, yards slung in chains, boarding-nettings&#xD;
traced, magazines opened, and, armed from head to loot, the picked men of every&#xD;
crew waited with anxiety for the signal to engage. As usual, Edward, Pipes, and&#xD;
Sambo were at the same gun. 'The signal went forth, the mighty cannon bdomed&#xD;
and thundered, 'And, with awful flashes of vivid fire, the work of wild havoc began.&#xD;
Soon tall masts toppled ; soon scuppers ran with bjood; noon wrecks strewed the&#xD;
sea; soon ships began to reel, and stagger, and founder, and sink ; soon grim,&#xD;
black wrecks, with red rivulets coursing their sides, went foundering, water-logged,&#xD;
with rudders shot away ; soon others began to welter in fatal fires ; .soon the&#xD;
magazines exploded, and rent men and-timbers into burning atoms, till dismembered&#xD;
limbs, bleeding and charred, fell out of the air into the waters, and made stout&#xD;
hearts sick with the horrible ugliness of the sight.&#xD;
This time again the English fleet was victorious, but it had paid for the triumph&#xD;
by an appalling loss of men and ships for the French had fought with that desperate&#xD;
bravery characteristic of their greater battles; and the knowledge that this was in&#xD;
a manner one of those decisive combats which settle the fate of a people and a&#xD;
nation, urged them to efforts that were stupendous, and so produced so prodigious&#xD;
a sacrifice. It was really avenging the victory.&#xD;
This time Pipes fell terribly wounded on deck, and was in turn assisted into the&#xD;
cockpit by Edward and the friendly negro. . The poor fellow had been shot through&#xD;
the chest, and at one time the hemorrhage was so considerable as led Edward to&#xD;
fear that death would be so instantaneous as to preclude those last words and&#xD;
solemn farewells, men who have been upon such friendly, even brotherly terms, in&#xD;
storm and battle, love to give. He rallied, however, and as he opened his waning&#xD;
eyes, their softened expression fell on the two anxious faces before him. As he&#xD;
stretched out a hand to each, and read their concern for him, a smile broke on his&#xD;
rugged face, softening those grim lineaments into something almost beautiful, and&#xD;
he said, but faintly and with an effort,-&#xD;
" They've cut-my-life-lines now-messmates. I'm adrift, d'ye see, and want&#xD;
a bhoy, or a life-boat-and it's-getting dark-very dark. Where are you Ned,&#xD;
my boy ?" he asked, in a hurried and changed tone, which denoted a crisis.&#xD;
"Here," said Edward mournfully,-" here, by your side."&#xD;

"That's-that's right," gasped the old seaman; "I've got poor Sambo's hand&#xD;
In mine. 'Tis a, warm, stout hand---is-Sambo's-be kind to him, Ned-for m&#xD;
sake. You're-you're close--to me, do you say ?-"&#xD;
"1Close to you," replied Edward, much affected at the tenderness which the&#xD;
rugged sailor manifested towards the negro, who, to tell the truth, received but&#xD;
little consideration from the other sailors ; " close to you, Pipes, old friend."&#xD;
"That's right-stand-by, and. steady," Pipes continued  W'vesodb&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
NWS FRO. THE ABSENT*-&#xD;
ALMOST at the same time, soothing tie anxieties of those in the home of the&#xD;
Plmers, in the home of te less submissive and irritable father of Ellen, and to&#xD;
the still more desolate hearth of poor Dame Morris, came news of the absent ones.&#xD;
Wounded and iIl  ut still happy beyond t1he power' of words tq convey, Charles&#xD;
took the earliest opportunity of writing'to his parents, stating his hopes soon to be&#xD;
with thew, Yai d relating, in a postcript, tt;ose, how bravely Ellen had retrieved&#xD;
herself, aid= gven to his love ;sp loftyngppgreciption. 'hat mysterious and in-&#xD;
explicable relation, too, which existed between the twin-brothers, seemed to produce&#xD;
a lettertfromrMdward simultaneously wih 'that df dharles ; and the home of Martin&#xD;
Palmer, so long deficient in its, old cheerfilness and mirth, began to put on an&#xD;
appearance of joyousness. ''he 'old man at once appgayed to have become a dozen&#xD;
years younger,, Mrs. Ialper prepared for ther eception of 'both' her sons, as her&#xD;
strong maternal hopes, that converted a wish into a reality, argued for the best ;&#xD;
and on the delicate countenance of Rose,long so sadly subiige to her 'ate, the&#xD;
roses began to bloom once anore. Tliey were now eagerly expectant: none knew&#xD;
the mon ent when the' bloyed ones, so long absent, might cross the threshold.&#xD;
B3loth had been wounded, both -had done their duty,and of oth the most gratifying&#xD;
pi'aises had been heard-.                       ,&#xD;
Fram the day that the wa ward Ellen Freshville had quitted her father's .roof,&#xD;
From theiday thatethe wa&#xD;
the stern old man had lookd wth a wrathful gnd vindictive eye upon the family&#xD;
of the Palmers. F 'or one of iem had,s" beautiful daughter sacrificed her name,&#xD;
his pride, and'aU the brilliant hopes which the ,selfish and ambitious man had&#xD;
formed. For a "life full of vicissitude, 'peril, anl of vulgar c9ntiniencies, this&#xD;
maiden, so delicately nurtured, bad surrendered all the conforts, and luxuries of'a&#xD;
home eminentlyattractve, -where she reigned sole and undisputed mistress. It was&#xD;
with some sense of uneasiness, of pity, and of pride, however, that Martin Palmer&#xD;
and his wife beheld the usually hard and .pitiless parent of Ellen enter their house&#xD;
on the following day, holding a letter 'inhishand. His strongly marked features&#xD;
betrayed an unusual emotion ; and though the firm jaw and the shaggy eyebrows&#xD;
had the same repellent power in them as before, his voice was softened, and in his&#xD;
eyes there was a milder gleam than Marin had witnessed for a long time.&#xD;
" Have you heard from your son Charles ?" lie asked, after a pause.&#xD;
" Yes-yesterday,", was the answer.&#xD;
"I have heard als from my daughter. I-I have wronged you ! Forgive me !"&#xD;
and he held out his and to the astonished - carpenter, who took it, saying,'"I am&#xD;
'glad you have heard, from Miss Ellen,-and Ihope that you will find now that we&#xD;
were not to blame-"-&#xD;
"Yes--yes," lurriedly said Mr.Fre hville; "none to blame but myself. But;"&#xD;
added he, with a firmer accent, "let them;return,, and I will make them both happy.&#xD;
'My brother, Major Freshville, whose life yogr son Charles has savedVspeaks of his&#xD;
bravery and goodness, as Ellen does of his devotion, and of her love that nothing&#xD;
can alter. I resist no longer. I am an' old man, and must learn to forgive before&#xD;
it is too late ; and to-day I send her my pardon, granting all her prayers, and&#xD;
sending her such immediate means for .ner return as may be necessary. Not a&#xD;
word now-not a word. I cannot trust myself to speak-only, do you write to&#xD;
Charles : tell him to hasten and look on me as a second father, if he will, for I now&#xD;
see that nobleness of nature belongs to no one class more especially than to another.&#xD;
Good-bye-good-bye. I have a good deal to do-much to learn-muc to unlearn&#xD;
and forget ; if it be not too late, I will do so !" and leaving them al lost in sur&#xD;
prise and joy, Mr. Freshville abruptly departed.&#xD;
&#xD;
._      _. - -  -  1&#xD;
&#xD;
Evidently he had s me weighty and hurried matters that pressed 'anxiously upon&#xD;
him; for striking oat of Walton, and entirely from the 'direction ofthis own house&#xD;
he made for Kirkdale, and without word or question sought out the cottage -of&#xD;
Dame Morris, which (being his own) he was not 'long 'in finding. 'He pushed. open&#xD;
the door, and a more wretched scene had not often met his eyes.. Ragged and&#xD;
dirty, the younger crying for food, the children lay about the floor. Sunk in&#xD;
apathy, her aged. face furrowed by privation, and her eyes red with weeping,' the&#xD;
poor woman, deprived of Jane, bereaved of her son, her support and her, pride,&#xD;
despite his follies, looked the very picture of misery. She saw and knew Mr.&#xD;
Freshville in a moment, and feebly rose from her chair.&#xD;
" I cannot pay your rent,.Mr. Freshville,"' sbe'said, plaintively.&#xD;
"You once called upon me on behalf of your son, Robert Morris; did you not ?'&#xD;
he began, without heeding her words.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I did," she answered, with a sigh. "Yes-I thought-L-but he was&#xD;
taken from me-dhe had deserted-he was-punished."&#xD;
Evidently the letter she had received brought:little comfort.&#xD;
" And I refusedto listen toyou, to hear you. I have been punished for it ; but&#xD;
if I had I could not have aided you. That makes no:difference," continued IMr.&#xD;
Freshville ; "and I might have made my refusal a little less harsh, at least---"&#xD;
"Oh! sir-but :I don't know what to say!", began the widow.  -&#xD;
"Say, at least, nothing about your rent; and"take-'this for present wants,"-and&#xD;
he handed her a guinea., Heedless of her exclamation; he went on. "Have you&#xD;
heard from him at all since his departure? Do not thank :me. I owe you. some&#xD;
thing, at least. I owe much more to many," he added, apart, "than I fear I ever&#xD;
can pay. Have you had-a letter ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, yesterday," returned the surprised widow; who, knowing the nature&#xD;
of the man that stood before her, was. utterly bewildered by his words and liberality.&#xD;
"Thank God!                        y Pray let me see it !" he exclaimed, breathlessly  ";Quick 1so&#xD;
that he can be written to at once."&#xD;
Dame Morris, despite the 'hope which sprang up in her bosom, could not help&#xD;
shaking her head, with a mournful air, as she advanced to the chimney-piece; and&#xD;
taking a letter, 'creased and soiled,, out of a little chinacup-his cup-which stood&#xD;
thereon, handed it to her visitor in silence; who, putting on his spectacles, hastened&#xD;
to read it, with an,, attention that showed he was really in earnest, whatever his&#xD;
motive might have been.&#xD;
"His fate has been a hard one.! his lot a sad one, Mrs. Morris !" he said, after'&#xD;
having read it ; and refolding it, toordown some particulars,-and theiddress,'into&#xD;
:his note-book. "However, let us hope that it will not 'last long.' He has been-wrecked&#xD;
and wounded ; but he has a tender, trusting, loving heart beside him, I'll tell you&#xD;
what it is-your sex shames ours ; and if it was only for my daughter's sake, Iwill&#xD;
try and reward his young wife's constancy and affection (for he has ma-rried his&#xD;
cousin Jane, you see, he says,) -and I will see, at once, about purchasing his dis-,&#xD;
charge. If I have been a hard man- apd that I feel I have in too many instances&#xD;
I hope I have the 'courage to acknowledge faults, and the grace. to be sorry for&#xD;
them. Get those young ones fed, cleaned,: and clothed-" and he glanced con-&#xD;
miseratingly around him.&#xD;
" Oh ! sir, you give me a new life-you make mhe hope," began.Mrs. Morris ; but&#xD;
gratitude is oftentimes not very'eloquent; uand she could only stammer her thanks.&#xD;
"Hope !"' echoed t1he old man almostot gaily. " Ihope I-do miake you 'hope.. If&#xD;
there's hope in a .gnarled old trunk like,-me°,what may you andyounger ones not&#xD;
hope for. So no more on that score. I'll find employment for your two boys, and&#xD;
the others shall go to school;'and'we'll soon: change all thisM--" +&#xD;
" May heaven bless you, sir-I" faltered the poor widow.&#xD;
" Now, write the letter' for your son, and bring it to my house to' be forwarded&#xD;
as soon as that is done ; and if you can't write, get a neighbor to do it. Leave&#xD;
the rest to me. Be certain that before Christmas conies you'll see him at home&#xD;

free, and all right, I hope. And now-and now-good day."  And hurrying out&#xD;
of-the cottage;to avoid the torrent of gratitude he knew was coming, the old man,&#xD;
with a lighter heart than he had -carried for many a day, hurried back home, and&#xD;
engaged himself in the several pieces of business he had undertaken, like a man&#xD;
who knew the priceless value of every moment.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
THE MEETING OF THE TWIN-BROTHE RS .&#xD;
SoMs weeks after this, there was a great commotion at Portsmouth, for the cre .&#xD;
of the " Bonita" had been paid off, had received their prize-money, and, marvello- .&#xD;
to say, were their own masters, in spite of many fears to the contrary. But.fortue&#xD;
was favorable to them ; and Edward, with Tom Tempest and Sambo White,&#xD;
presided over a huge festival, given among the crew of the old Harpy, previous to&#xD;
exercising the right of his discharge, and restrained his impatience to see Rose and&#xD;
his parents, in remembrance of old companions in breeze and battle, whom he was&#xD;
never likely to see again ; for one thing he had determined on, viz., that he would&#xD;
no more tempt the dangers of press-gangs or crimps ; but, having discharged his&#xD;
part in many important engagements in the war, live for the future for himself.&#xD;
This his discharge gave him the right to do. Besides, he was now a rich man.&#xD;
The revelry of seamen on shore, after a long and protracted cruise, especially if&#xD;
successful, has been so often and so well described, that we may be spared any&#xD;
further attempt-at detailing the present scene of jollity. As a whole, the picture&#xD;
was something like the following&#xD;
The largest room in the " Admiral's Head" was occupied by some sixty or eighty&#xD;
noisy, elated, bronzed, and jovial tars. The groaning tables were covered with a&#xD;
profusion that certainly made up for many a past " banyan" day ; and air, earth,&#xD;
and sea had been ransacked for the prodigious feast. The Indies (East and West.)&#xD;
the continent, and the islands of Greece, Sicily, and Madeira supplied them with&#xD;
spirits, wines, and scarcest liquors ; but the general tendency was in favor of&#xD;
punch,-of which vast China bowels were continually being brought in replenished,&#xD;
and emptied with a gusto that soon raised the guests to an hilarity fitted for&#xD;
" fiddlers'-green."  Dancing was demanded ; and while coaches brought shoals of&#xD;
the fair sex of every hue and shade, all the fiddlers in Portsmouth were-engaged ;&#xD;
and, after one toast given to the memory of " The Harpy, her commander and crew&#xD;
(living and dead,") accompanied by cheers that were not unlike their own can-&#xD;
nonading, the more orderly aspect of the company gave way to that of riot ;-&#xD;
dancing, singing, courting, drinking, fighting, and the rest of it, made up the sum,&#xD;
It was now that Edward, accompanied by Sambo White, who was also going to&#xD;
London, found an opportunity to steal away and seek the coach-office, where he&#xD;
had already secured places. From all, he had parted on the kindliest terms ; a few,&#xD;
not so far gone, called for vehicles, and insisted on going with him to " head&#xD;
quarters".and seeing him off, " getting under way and making sail," -and the rest&#xD;
of it ; and with all that noisy, vigorous, and showy demonstrations. which sailors&#xD;
are so devotedly attached to, our hero was conducted like a conqueror to his&#xD;
coach.                                                             ,&#xD;
"1You're not going to turn into that there crib of a cabin I hopes, Ned," said&#xD;
Tempest, rolling a great quid in his mouth. -,"Why, old Jack Pipes wouldn't have&#xD;
owned ye. Mount aloft man,.and con the craft. Mayhap, your helmsman may&#xD;
want a hint."&#xD;
And Edward, in obedience to this hint, mounted the coach, on the top of which&#xD;
the Union Jack, fixed to a pole, was flying. Beside him got Sambo; and a&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
THE TWIN BROTHER$.,&#xD;
&#xD;
93&#xD;
&#xD;
glorious crowd of tars,hurrying to. London for their prize-money and liberty, filled&#xD;
the remaining seats. They had a fiddler, plenty of provisions, while bottles of rum&#xD;
were freely handed round ; and amidst an incessant shower of rude wit, good-&#xD;
humored badmage, and sundry oceanic expletives, which were often grotesque iii&#xD;
their imagery, Edward, with a sense of freedom, with a buoyancy of hope freshly&#xD;
revived, and cheered by the reflection that whatever he might have suffered, was&#xD;
now over, and that he was at last on his homeward road. Home ! how thatdear&#xD;
word brought the old faces fondly before his mental vision once more.&#xD;
It also happened, that on this very day a Lisbon packet had landed several&#xD;
passengers, male and female.: Among them was a man, young, worn and pale,&#xD;
whose appearance denoted that of an invalid, while somethingabout him indicated&#xD;
the soldier. By him, withanair of most affectionate solicitude, hovered a beautiful&#xD;
young woman, pale too ; but-both smiled when they encountered, each other's eyes ;&#xD;
and there was, despite the look of wanness and suffering in the man's face, sufficient&#xD;
to show that it was of' a temporary kind-that rest and nursing would soon restore&#xD;
to him his old vigor and elasticity, while every hour appeared to produce in his&#xD;
companion the most gratifying change for the better. - Both had evidently suffered&#xD;
much ; but it would seem as if- their sufferings, were about to be among those&#xD;
forgotten things which heighten the enjoyment of the present. They, too, sought&#xD;
the, coach, into which both entered.&#xD;
A strange unimaginable thrill ran through Edward's breast as the cdach door&#xD;
closed on the last two comers, whom he could not see ; and this sensation filled&#xD;
.him with emotions so conflicting, that he could not.comprehend the nature of those&#xD;
fancies working so vividly in his busy brain. Nor indeed would the gay, spirits of&#xD;
.his companions afford him much leisure. Finally, with one continued round of&#xD;
cheers, the coach bore away its cargo, leaving the rest to return to the. revel, or&#xD;
follow the example of the departing ones with all convenient speed.&#xD;
How pleasant were these charming English roads, through pasture lands, breezy&#xD;
uplands, over wooded heights, through verdant hollow,-and by ivy-covery villages,&#xD;
where the homes nestled like birds under the sheltering wing, when compared to&#xD;
the trackless sea, the stormy nights, the. battle plain, the storm and siege ; for&#xD;
those without, and those within, had experienced each of these, and they never&#xD;
thought that the loveliness of an English landscape could have beet so perfect as&#xD;
it now appeared by comparison with scenes and places so diametrically opposed.&#xD;
Charles-for it was :he and Ellen who were within--experienced the same.&#xD;
yearning as his brother did, and dreaming as little of being near to Edward at that&#xD;
moment as he would of being in Nova Zembla ; yet there ran through his soul'&#xD;
some consciousness that spirit called to spirit-that a mystical and magnetic com-&#xD;
munication was passing between them. He knew that in sleep. this would be more&#xD;
definite ; the active, waking functions of the body kept this current of communion&#xD;
at bay, so far as to embarrass its direct run and tendency. He sought to sleep,&#xD;
but the very fact that he sought that while the frame was not prepared for it,&#xD;
drove sleep away. He could close his eyes, but this was the signal for opening&#xD;
them again, with an acquisition of wakeful vigor that made him give over the&#xD;
attempt in despair, but which did not calm the irritation of his spirits. Even the&#xD;
presence and the conversation of Ellen, her, tender attention to, his.comforts (for&#xD;
he was yet her patient-brave girl that she was!) could scarcely soothe him.&#xD;
Towards evening, the coach rattled along the great road into town. They were&#xD;
in London-the queen of cities !-the mistress of the world!-the mightiest capital&#xD;
since the coronet had faded on the brows of Rome! Along Piccadilly to the&#xD;
White Horse Cellar, it flew among cheers and greetings-for.seamen were in high&#xD;
favor with 'the populace--and our jolly tars returned their cheers with shouts as&#xD;
deeply sounding as had ever echoed along,the decks, or when cannon thundered on&#xD;
the deeps. The living load dismounted, and the men approached and reeognised&#xD;
each other.&#xD;
" Edward !-dear brother I" cried Charles.&#xD;
