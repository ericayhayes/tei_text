&#xD;
of youth should have lingered to caress her. It being&#xD;
i~~sted upon Maud Livingstone, while the rosy sunbeams&#xD;
tlie~ daily delight of her guardian to impress her with the&#xD;
idea that she was little better than a pauper, and that it&#xD;
was only by his generosity that she was not a beggar in&#xD;
the streets, no surprise will be expressed w~n it is re~&#xD;
corded that life failed to impress her with t1i~se Protean&#xD;
charms which usually fascinate the young.&#xD;
A chic to the malignant persecutions which were&#xD;
heaped upon this orphan girl may be discovered in the&#xD;
fact, that he had deeply wronged her.&#xD;
Aye, and to go further, it was because his conscience&#xD;
unceasingly racked him with the thought that lie had&#xD;
buried her father in a bankrupt's grave, while his coffers&#xD;
were enriched with the gold won by treachery, and&#xD;
which, by right, should now be hers.&#xD;
Could the same last resting-place have held both parent&#xD;
and child, he would have gloated on their double death&#xD;
With the~ brutal pleasure of a ghoul. Failing, however,&#xD;
to realize this wicked desire, and having the child evei'&#xD;
before him as a daily torture, he made her young life&#xD;
pay the penalty of his iniquity in loneliness and in teai~.&#xD;
Mrs. Marlowe shared the prejudices of her husband ~n&#xD;
all subjects, and only added fresh thorns to the crown&#xD;
~which they daily placed upon the unoffending head of&#xD;
tlieir helpless charge. She was a living representative of&#xD;
~ cei~tain class, who are saint~ in public, and vipers in&#xD;
pri ~ge life, and with much external, religion, her woman'~&#xD;
~ ~~nwomanly heart entertained no spark of sympathy for&#xD;

that they would be to her as father and mother? Were&#xD;
they not afraid that he would come back from the grave&#xD;
to blast them ~ven as they were bligh ting the life of hi8&#xD;
fitagile child AMen who have no fear or respect of God&#xD;
in their hearts dare do anything, arid living in fancied&#xD;
security, dream nut of the wrath that is accumulating&#xD;
ao'ainsf and ~itin~ for them until the final day. 4... ~&#xD;
Under this galling experience, Maud's young heart&#xD;
became embittered just when her pathway should have&#xD;
been strewn with roses. Her nature was as sensitive&#xD;
as a poet's, and some faint idea of the oppression under&#xD;
which she daily writhed may be found in her constant&#xD;
contemplation of suicide. But these thoughts would be&#xD;
vanquished by the consciousness~ of the sin of indulging&#xD;
them, and taking up her cross again, Maud would return&#xD;
with heavy heart to bitter realities, determined to meet,&#xD;
if powerless to resist, her cruel fate.&#xD;
Among the mountains of Georgia, the beautiful village&#xD;
of M~ nestled lovingly, arid with its varying scenery~&#xD;
cool air, and good water, presented a delightful retreat ~&#xD;
to those who were in search of health and repose. Among&#xD;
its most honorable citizens Mr. Marlowe stood ~pre-emb :i~&#xD;
nent, and when people passed his stately residence thayE&#xD;
said, "How fortunate Maud tivingstone is, to have s~reh&#xD;
iJoi~n~! alas, they knew nothing of the tears shed at&#xD;
midnight~beneath that inhospitable roof-..they dreiuzit&#xD;
not of the young life within those unfriendly walls, wli.iel~&#xD;
slaked it~ thirst only from the bitter waters of Marali.&#xD;
Wi~fhin that house a trio sat ~t the~ tea-t'  -~&#xD;
~ng, a~d without knowing that ~they were living,&#xD;
ing creatures, they might have been mistake~fo  ~&#xD;

~WHO WAS HER FATHER?"         15&#xD;
&#xD;
14         "WHO WAS HER FATHER?"&#xD;
&#xD;
tons, for they exchanged no words, and the only sound&#xD;
to be. heard was the sipping of tea, and the occasional&#xD;
clatter of china. The room was severe, but tasteful, and&#xD;
the same precision~ which was to be observed from~garrct&#xD;
to basement in that prim house, here also predoiiiiii~ted.&#xD;
The walls \vere frescoed in light oak, the furniture was&#xD;
rich and elaborately carved, while carpet and curtains&#xD;
,harmoniously blended ~in producing that effect upon the&#xD;
eye, which found ready endorsement by cultiv~itcd taste.&#xD;
The side-board and tea-table glittered with silver, but&#xD;
little did the penniless girl who ~sat there imagine that it&#xD;
was purchased by her father's ruin and death. Maud's&#xD;
tea ~vas untasted, and she sat carelessly turning the pages&#xD;
of the "Court of Napoleon." Mr. Marlowe had handed&#xD;
her' the book when he entered, and on the title-page was&#xD;
written, "A birthday gift for Maud, from G. S."&#xD;
True, it was her seventeenth birthday, but she had for~&#xD;
gotten it until that moment, and as memory took a hasty&#xD;
review of the cheerless past she sighed, in thinking of its&#xD;
loijeliness.&#xD;
Scanning the book hastily, she turned again to the&#xD;
* frontispiece, which represented Josephine in all the&#xD;
gorgeousness of, imperial robes, and in all the radiance of&#xD;
effulgent prosperity, fo~ the picture 'had evidently been&#xD;
taken at the flood of fortune. But while looking upon&#xD;
the smi1h~g face, Maud's thoughts recalled the noble&#xD;
woman in her wretchedness, the deserted wife who was&#xD;
sacrificed to gratify ambition; and she wondered if any&#xD;
1. pi4ure was extant of the discrowned queen, who passed&#xD;
tbe evening of her life in such desolation at the omin~&#xD;
~ti~1y named' palace of .Afalmctison, the house of pain.&#xD;
The chord of sympathy '~~~as touched, for a heart which&#xD;
&#xD;
has had sorrow of its own is always more sincere in Leek&#xD;
ing for the misfortunes of others, and to Maud's chagrin&#xD;
a tear dropped upon the open page.&#xD;
"Maud, your tea is getting cold; put by your book&#xD;
until you have eaten something;" and Mrs. Marlowe's'&#xD;
voice jarred discordantly on the silence.&#xD;
"Thank you, I do not wish any tea," and her ~voice&#xD;
was tremulous wi~h hushed tears.&#xD;
"Well, what are you crying about? I do not see any.&#xD;
*   thing to cry for."&#xD;
"Always blubbering about something," added Mar.'&#xD;
lowe, looking up. insteadd of being thankful for the&#xD;
home I g~ve you, one would suppose you were shut up in&#xD;
a dungeon, from the way you go moping and crying&#xD;
around."&#xD;
"Indeed, I'm very grateful, Mr. Marlowe," Maud&#xD;
answered, between sobs and tears.&#xD;
"Thankful, the d-l! What are you always crying.&#xD;
for, then?"&#xD;
"Be~ause-.-..--.2' But the sentence was nnfinishej for&#xD;
the tears burst forth in such a torrent, as to prevent fur:&#xD;
tlier conversation.&#xD;
Even the heart of the waiter was touched, and ~he&#xD;
brushed away a. tea~ that flowed in sympathy for the*&#xD;
unfortunate girl, whose lot had been cast amoY~g such&#xD;
unfeeling people, while the faces 'of husband and wife&#xD;
Were expressive rather of triumph than of kindness.&#xD;
After watching Maud for some little time, Marlowe&#xD;
said-.-&#xD;
"You'll find when you have to work for your daily&#xD;
bread, that you'll not have time for so much&#xD;
o perhaps you had better take it out here."&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;

<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8258-00000008"/>&#xD;
16&#xD;
&#xD;
WHO WAS HER FATHER?"&#xD;
&#xD;
No response but fresh SOI)5. Suddenly s rting up~&#xD;
and gi~asping her book, Maftd was hastening from the&#xD;
room, when Marlowe sprang to the door, and seizing her&#xD;
by the arm, detained her saying,-&#xD;
"not so fast, Miss Sentimentality; I have business&#xD;
with you. As you know, you have been educated for a&#xD;
teacher, and it was the dying request of your father that&#xD;
~ou should not be a dependent, after you were old.&#xD;

sufficiently far advanced for you to take charge of at&#xD;
least a primary class, and I wished to ask if you desire&#xD;
me to advertise for a situation for you?"&#xD;
The last sentence had been spokeii in such a sneering&#xD;
tone as to arouse Maud's xvhole being with indignation,&#xD;
~nd standing there weeping, the desire of her heart was&#xD;
to be a man, that she might strike her tormentor dead at&#xD;
N\   her feet.&#xD;
Marlowe still held her by the arm, and after awaiting ~&#xD;
impatiently for a reply, said:&#xD;
"Did you hear what I said?."&#xD;
K        "Tf you please," was the indistinct reply, and fresh&#xD;
P tears were added to the torrent which was falling, as she&#xD;
then fully realized that the "wide, wide world" was soon&#xD;
to be her home.&#xD;
"Why do you not marry George Stanley?"&#xD;
As if forced to answer, she said brokenly,-&#xD;
"ITe-has-never-aske). me."&#xD;
"From present appearances, he'll do that soon," Mar~&#xD;
lowe said sneeringly, as he dashed her arm ~wayjrom&#xD;
him; "and who knows, perhaps you may be a fin lady&#xD;
some day, instead of a poor little music teacher!"&#xD;
But Maud was gone, for human nature could stand nu&#xD;

UNDER THE MOONLIGHT/            17&#xD;

&#xD;
EORGE STANLEY was very popular, and nW&#xD;
unjustly, for it is rare to find a man combining;&#xD;
so many admirable traits. To a widowe4 moth~&#xD;
er and only sister, he was a model son and brother,&#xD;
leaving nothing undone which could add to their happi~&#xD;
ness. By his habits of morality and general good coii~&#xD;
duct, he had won the respect of old and young, and it&#xD;
had passed into a proverb, that "George Stanley had net&#xD;
an e~einy in the tpwn." Add to his unblemished repu~&#xD;
station a large fortune, and the combination which made&#xD;
him so eagerly sought will be readily discovered. All&#xD;
things taken into consideration, it is not surprising tht~t&#xD;
several match-making inammas failed to hide their vexa~&#xD;
tion, ahd that as many calculating papas groaned in~&#xD;
hardly, when it became currently reported that he w~s a&#xD;
suitor for the hand of the penniless Ataud Livfrgt~~&#xD;
But women are not generally attracted hy such mo~&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8258-00000009"/>&#xD;
men, and not infrequently' are they discarded for the&#xD;
dash and impudence of some reckless profligate. Domes~&#xD;
tic unhappiness ensues, and when it is too late, the warn-&#xD;
ings 'of anxious parents ring in tliQ ears of the wretched&#xD;
,'and perhaps forsaken wives.&#xD;
George had been Maud's earliest and best friend, and&#xD;
it is not strange that this long-existing friendship should&#xD;
~have ripened into a warmer feeling, as the years advanced.&#xD;
.Their parents had been deeply attached to each other,&#xD;
and this family were solitary in besto~~dng upon Maud&#xD;
that love for which her bereaved heart yearned. It was&#xD;
only beneath their roof that she ever approached gayety,&#xD;
as it was there only that the pleasures of home were&#xD;
revealed to her. Almost every day saw her the recipient&#xD;
of some delicate gift from George, which was evidently&#xD;
the suggestion of a deep and thoughtful love ;~ but in&#xD;
accepting these tokens of his affectionate regard, she&#xD;
failed to realize that she was encouraging a passion which&#xD;
her heart could never reciprocate.&#xD;
As yet, no word of love had passed between them, and&#xD;
rumor was false in naming the solitaire diamond ring&#xD;
worn by her a betrothal pledge. True, George had&#xD;
placed it upon her finger, but there was nothing binding&#xD;
in it; and she innocently wore it, without the thought&#xD;
that it might excite inquiry or suspicion.&#xD;
She had been spending the evening at the Stanleys',.&#xD;
and George thought he had never seen her look so beaw&#xD;
tiful, dressed as she was in' simple white, with a moss&#xD;
rosebud in her rich brown hair. In truth, he was infat-&#xD;
~iated, and, under the witching. influence' of the moonlight&#xD;
that night, he felt as if forced to disclose the unutterable&#xD;
Iove'which filled his heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
His deep blue eyes were brimming with tenderness, a~&#xD;
now and then he furtively gazed upon her, in the half&#xD;
cowardliness with which love sometimes possesses his'&#xD;
victim; and silently they wended their footsteps in the&#xD;
moonlit direction of the Marlowes'.&#xD;
The silence was ominous, Maud thought, for women&#xD;
know by intuition when a certain interesting hour has&#xD;
arrived, and the bantering words which4 she tried' to&#xD;
speak died upon her lips. Both were ill at ease, and while&#xD;
George only looked and sighed, IMlaud hummed snatches&#xD;
of song to hide her embarrassment, and then-after&#xD;
a wlmile-George said in a stammering, school-boyish&#xD;
way:&#xD;
"Do you know, Maud, that for years I have done little&#xD;
else than think of and love you ?" and pressing her hand,&#xD;
he gazed into her face f~or&#xD;
lie was trembling 'with his reply.&#xD;
the emotion which thrilled his&#xD;
being, and it was a rude shock to him when Maud laughed&#xD;
in his face, and said:&#xD;
"Why, George, what a woi~tl~less life you have led!"&#xD;
"No, not worthless, if I have won your love in return;"&#xD;
his tone expressing all the earnestness he felt.&#xD;
"You know I love you, George, for I think you are the&#xD;
only friend I have in all the world."&#xD;
"It is not as a frieimd that II wish you to love me, Maud,&#xD;
but as your husband."&#xD;
"But I cannot love you as my husband unless we were&#xD;
married," ~he answered laughingly, determined If possi-&#xD;
ble to evade 'the crisis.&#xD;
"But i~wish you to be married to me, darling, and&#xD;
could you look into my heart, and see how I wQrship you,&#xD;

~deut of Sn CCCS5.&#xD;
With the singular rapidity which is perhaps only&#xD;
known to women, all the friendship that she' had for&#xD;
merly entertained for George was instantly changed into&#xD;
a kind of disgust, and she almost disliked him.&#xD;
Explain it, ~ye who can! Maud only knew that th~J'&#xD;
change was there, and although scorning herself for such )&#xD;
ingratitude, she still could not control the sudden&#xD;
unaccountable revulsion which had taken place in her&#xD;
heart. They were now at the door, and the declaration&#xD;
she had first listened to remained unanswered. She&#xD;
deeply regretted this misplaced love, and her silence&#xD;
arose from a desire to avoid giving pain..&#xD;
"Why 'do you not speak to me, Maud?" he then said,&#xD;
anxiously.&#xD;
But still no answer came. 'Then pressing her hand to&#xD;
his lips, he murmured, in a pleading tone:&#xD;
"Don't you love me, j tist a little, Maud?"&#xD;
Now, why could she not have looked him in the face,&#xD;
and in a straightforward, honest way have said, "No;&#xD;
Idon't!"&#xD;
She was not a coquette, but her great desire to spare&#xD;
her ~Iover's, feeling made her vacillating to a degree that&#xD;
rendered her almost as culpable as a premeditated flirt.&#xD;
For the first time this trait of~ her woman's nature pre-&#xD;
dominated, and she answered his question by saying very&#xD;
archly:&#xD;
"Don't you know?"&#xD;
"But tell me, Mand, do you love me?" His tone was,&#xD;
Lull of apprehension.&#xD;
"And what if I don't?" she said, playfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
UNDER THE MOONLIGHT.            21&#xD;
"how tantalizing you are;" but 'never suspecting front&#xD;
her manner that his love was not returned, he folded hei~&#xD;
to his heart and said:&#xD;
"Come now, darling, let this ring you wear be our&#xD;
gagement ring," and as ho attempted to seal the sacred&#xD;
mpact with a kiss, she cried:&#xD;
'Oh-no !-no !-no-George!" and, blushing half&#xD;
with shame, she extricated herself from' bis embrace.&#xD;
~, Then seeking refuge within the hall, and peepin~through&#xD;
an opening in the door, she said:&#xD;
"Good-night, George! Good-night."&#xD;
But the heart of the young man was deeply wounded;&#xD;
and without responding he walked sadly and slowly&#xD;
away. His frank, cheery face wore an aggrieved expres-'&#xD;
~ sion as the moonlight fell upon it, and his heart ached&#xD;
~ with the keen disappointment for which he was so en~&#xD;
i timely unprepared. It was a cruel 'awakening from a&#xD;
dream, rosy with hope and sweetened by e4ectation.&#xD;
Until that moment he never suspected but that the love&#xD;
of his young lifetime had kindled something like mag-&#xD;
netic sympathy in the heart of iMlaud Livingstone.&#xD;
Engagement ring, indeed!" she said, when within&#xD;
her chamber she jerked the unoffending diamond from&#xD;
her linger. And as his love, so was his gift spurned-.&#xD;
his sole offence, that he loved her!&#xD;
ho can explain it? What is the cause of such per- ~f'&#xD;
versity ~ Why is it that both men and women feel a sort&#xD;
of sufficiency that amounts almost to contempt whenal&#xD;
love is won~&#xD;

She was his all in all-" the ocean to the river of his&#xD;

Under the moonlight which streamed into her room,&#xD;
Maud fell asleep thinking on all these inconsistencies,.&#xD;
~ud when the gray dawn marched silently up in the East,&#xD;
she still slumbered, dreaming of the mysteries and per-&#xD;
plexities of this twofold life.&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;

~~5HE HAS TWO EYES 50 SOFT AND BROWN.~~&#xD;
&#xD;
TIE was neither a blonde nor a brunette, but a&#xD;
beautiful woman, nevertheless, with glorious&#xD;
brown eyes, a low, broad forehead, bow-shaped&#xD;
moutI~ with crimson lips, pearly teeth, fresh complexion,&#xD;
chestAut hair, and Grecian contour. Her profile was&#xD;
strictly classic, and many an artist has sighed in vain for*~&#xD;
such a model. It was quite evident that Colonel hart-&#xD;
ridge was fast becoming a victim to her charms, and to&#xD;
Mrs. Marlowe's chagrin, the breakfast did not tempt him,&#xD;
for. his eyes did his feasting on the summer morning in&#xD;
piestion.&#xD;
The Colonel came from the beautiful seaboard cit~f&#xD;
~asrannah, and combined with a line personal appearance&#xD;
&#xD;
"SHE HAS TWO EYES SO SOFT AND BR0WN.~&#xD;
&#xD;
that courtliness of manner which is not unusual among&#xD;
her citizens. He was a lawyer of some eminenceA~~ ar3d&#xD;
having known Mr. Marlowe through business transae~ons,&#xD;
had been induced to accept an oft-repeated invitation to&#xD;
visit him. He was rather reticent than talkative, but&#xD;
what he said was well-spoken, and to the point.&#xD;
If Maud had ever thought of him at all, it was in a&#xD;
grandfatherly way, and although he had been~ in the&#xD;
house some weeks, they had exchanged but few wdrds.&#xD;
her deportment was always refined and lady-like, but&#xD;
over-sensitiveness produced a reserve which rendered hei&#xD;
almost unapproachable. J~&#xD;
Under these circumstances, Colonel Hartridge wor&#xD;
shipped at a respectful distance, and said little to the ob-&#xD;
ject of his admiration.&#xD;
Before his arrival, Maud had conceived a secret preju-&#xD;
dice against him, which was called forth by Mr. Marlowe's&#xD;
daily advertisement, in which he was announced as "a&#xD;
rich old widower, who was anxious to console himself in&#xD;
his lonely estate by the appropriation of a second help-&#xD;
meet," 't~tc. Daily contact only served to increase this&#xD;
unjust prejudice, which, after some weeks, had grown&#xD;
into a positive dislike.&#xD;
Becoming decidedly uncomfortable~ under the steady&#xD;
gaze of her vi&amp;amp;dvis, that morning, she excused herself,)&#xD;
after sipping a cup of coffee, and left the .breakfa~room,&#xD;
hurriedly. A few moments after, the house was filled&#xD;
with melody as a master-spirit presided at the piano. The&#xD;
selection was "La Cascade," that weird f~t~is~ of&#xD;
Pauer's, and the same under-current of feeling that in-&#xD;
spired the composer evidently pervaded the pe~fo~xpr~&#xD;
for the rendition of the piece was faultless. The nch~ -&#xD;

chords with which it begins are quite suggestive of the&#xD;
grand and silent depths of some vast forest, where one is&#xD;
suddenly startled by the splashing and pattering of a&#xD;
gentle waterfall, as it playf ally gurgles over its stony bed.&#xD;
Thei~ as the pretty demi-semi-quavers glid&amp;amp; harmoniously&#xD;
into each other, the imitation of rippling water is so true,&#xD;
that it seems to say:&#xD;
"I chatter over stony ways&#xD;
In little sharps and trebles;&#xD;
I bubble into eddying bays,&#xD;
I babble on the pebbles."&#xD;
And finally, when the sound of the last note dies away,&#xD;
&amp;amp;ne is sadly reminded of the fact that the little stream is&#xD;
lost also,*as it&#xD;
"Flows on to join the brimming river."&#xD;
During the performance Colonel llartridge had entered&#xD;

floated around her, would she forget a~ her loneliness,&#xD;
and her face would beam with the radiant happiness~ that&#xD;
dwelt in he~~ soul.&#xD;
~~There w~ silence still, and when looking through her&#xD;

"But really and truly, it affects me as no other mushy&#xD;
ever has~"&#xD;
"You are very kind to say so ;" and for the first time&#xD;
their eyes met, as she looked the thanks her lips failed to&#xD;
utter.&#xD;
This well-turned complimei~ was a fiag.of4rnce, ~nd a&#xD;
smile still played in the corners of her mouth, as she&#xD;
placed another selection upon the music-board. But just&#xD;
then her coinpan ion preferred conversation, and quite to&#xD;
her surprise he said:&#xD;
"What a brilliant solitaire you wear!"&#xD;
"Yes?" was the interrogatory reply, while her cheeks j&#xD;
were dyed with crimson, and at' the same moment she&#xD;
struck some chords on the ivory keys, to conceal her em~&#xD;
barrassment.&#xD;
Then, nothing daunted, he astonished her still more by&#xD;
saying:&#xD;
"Is rumor correct in naming the ring you ~wear an. eu&#xD;
gagement ring?&#xD;
"Colonel llartridge!" burst in surprise from her lips,&#xD;
while her eyes reiterated her astonishment.&#xD;
"You do not mind telling me, do you?"&#xD;
This but provoked his listener still niore. Then, after~&#xD;
looking searchingly at him for a moment, as if doubting&#xD;
his sanity, she arose from the piano:&#xD;
"You will pardon me," she said, "if I decline making.&#xD;
a confidant of an utter stranger."&#xD;
"It is tr~ue then?" he exclaimed; but she had vanishede,&#xD;
and only an odor of violets filled the air, while a pair ~f&#xD;

that if every wish is gratified, they still sigh for some-&#xD;

which do not end in weariness , and which point to an&#xD;
enduring hereafter, which shall begin and end in ever~&#xD;
lasting' joys? George thought that the possession of&#xD;
Maud's love would make him the happiest of men, while&#xD;
she believed that her joy would be complete, could her&#xD;
1)arel)ts be restored, and so they both were thinking as&#xD;
they drove slowly along a shaded road, which ran thrqngb&#xD;
a dense forest, one summer evening.. The. fleet-footed..&#xD;
Organs were covered with foam, and looked as if tl~ey&#xD;
had had a long and a fast run. A light shower still left -&#xD;
the rain-drops sparkling on the grass and wild-fiowers.-~&#xD;
the dove cooed mournfully at a safe distance--.--the part..&#xD;
ridge whistled .confidently from his hiding-piace--~-the&#xD;
frogs croaked noisily from a marsh near by, and the&#xD;
locusts screeched lazily from their refuge in the tree-tops..&#xD;
All nature seemed smiling and happy, but it was from&#xD;
no special good behavior on her part, for her la~w~ beh~g'&#xD;
fixed and inevitable, she can never commit the trans~tesv&#xD;
sions which, in the physical code, bring suffermg~&amp;amp;&#xD;
death to man.                                    -&#xD;
George sympathized fujly with the ancient dame ~&#xD;
her joyous mood, and all, things seemed to bear th&#xD;
impress of his new-found bliss.&#xD;
It is probable he was over-confident, though., for the&#xD;
sad expression which rested upon INland's pale face, aii~7&#xD;
the sighs which she strove to suppress, betofeued ~&#xD;
thing wrong within her breast.&#xD;
however, being under the delicious spell which IQv~&#xD;
first induces, George failed ~to observe Maud's sad an4 ~j&#xD;
abstracted manner. At length, becoming restive uu4~.4~&#xD;
the protracted silence, she said:&#xD;

"I am so happy, darling," and his eyes were beaming&#xD;
with love, as he gazed admiringly into her averted face.&#xD;
"I wish I could say the same," she sighed and. said.&#xD;
"I hope you can, dearest," he replied, in the innocence&#xD;
of his heart and the purity of his love.&#xD;
"No, George," she answered sadly; "I cannot recall&#xD;
a single happy hour, not even in childhood."&#xD;
"Do not think of the past, then," he said, tenderly.&#xD;
"I cannot forget the dark fate that cruelly deprived&#xD;
me of my parents, and left me so desolate;" and her&#xD;
voice trembled with unshed tears.&#xD;
"0 Maud, do not refer to it," was the grieved reply.&#xD;
But continuing, as if talking to herself, she said: -&#xD;
"Neither can I ever forget those hard-hearted people,&#xD;
who have so deeply embittered every hour of my life."&#xD;
"For' my sake, darling, do not think of them;" and&#xD;
could itliave been possible, his love would willingly have&#xD;
plunged in oblivion. the unhappy recollections of his&#xD;
cherished idol.&#xD;
"Could you know, George, half the agony which I&#xD;
have suffere~1, y~u would not be surprised to hear that I&#xD;
have often prayed to die;" apd her beautiful brown eyes&#xD;
were swimming in tears.&#xD;
4Ake any true man, George loved her infinitely more&#xD;
for her very loneliness, and longed to shield her from&#xD;
further suffering, under the ~gis of his warm heart.&#xD;
Drawing her to him, he said, tenderly:&#xD;
"Promise me, my 'darling, never to refer to the past&#xD;
again. - Promise me, 5 look forward to the future alone,&#xD;
which I shall endeavor to make bright and cloudless for&#xD;
~you. Do you promise?"&#xD;

"Your friendship."&#xD;
"Friendship indeed! say rather love, idolatry; for I&#xD;
can scarcely recall an hour in. which Ii have not wurshipped&#xD;
you.&#xD;
Knowing how undeserving she was of such deep love~ his&#xD;
words smote her, and she said:&#xD;
"You should not worship anything but your God. It&#xD;
is a sin"&#xD;
"If I never commit a greater crime, I have no fears&#xD;
about a home beyond the skies," was his joyous response.&#xD;
"I am unworthy of ~o much love, George, for I do not&#xD;
love as you do;" and Maud watched him closely to sceif&#xD;
any suspicion of the true stat~ of her feelings~ darted&#xD;
through his mii~d, for love i~ ever jealous, a~nd she hoped&#xD;
he would awaken from his false dream himself. On the - -&#xD;
contrary, he said, trustingly: -&#xD;
"At present, dearest, I have a sufficent supply for both.&#xD;
By and by, when I have made you&#xD;
I have done something to merit your love, I will deman&#xD;
the exchange."&#xD;
"You are too good, George," she answered, and evad..&#xD;
ing entirely the subject in question.&#xD;
"I wish you would be equally good, and make me&#xD;
supremely happy by naming our wedding-day."&#xD;
Why did she start, then hurry to say, with averted face: ~&#xD;
"Not this evening, George.'~&#xD;
In a tone of disappointment, he said, "Is it always to&#xD;

They~ had, at least, made no change in a certain house.&#xD;

b&#xD;
the Marlowes.&#xD;
What could be the attraction?&#xD;
If peeping behind the curtain did not spoil the enjoy~&#xD;
merit of the play, a surmise might be revealed, but then&#xD;
t destroys the interest to anticipate, and 59 it is better to&#xD;
forbear.&#xD;
The advertisement had been inserted, and as IMlaud&#xD;
waited day after day for a response, the time hung heavily&#xD;
on her hands, and she longed for the hour which wrn~d&#xD;
take her from under that roof forever. Her music~was a&#xD;
source of great consolation, but yet she roamed absently&#xD;
around, like some spirit doomed to walk in penance hero&#xD;
awhile, before entering upon those joys which are to come~&#xD;
hereafter.&#xD;
Colonel Hartridge was neither blind nor slo~w of obser-&#xD;
vation; and his heart was filled with sympathy for this.&#xD;
lonely girl, who was the victim of such cold and unfeeling&#xD;
people. But notwithstanding these kindly sentiments, ~11&#xD;
heir frequent daily meetings, Maud repulsed him so de..&#xD;
cidedly as to make him very uncomfortable. ~he en~&#xD;
deavored to persuade herself that she disliked him, but at&#xD;
the same time acknowledged that he was deeidegly~&#xD;
superior to the numerous visitors with whom she mingled&#xD;
at her o'nardian's house; and upon a self-investigation of&#xD;
her estimate of him ,she found she rather admired him.&#xD;
"But what had becoxhe of George ?"&#xD;
Maud\sighed as she mentally asked this questio~r.&#xD;
Feeling unusually sad and depressed, she lingered ~&#xD;
a late one night over her music. After playing ~verA ;&#xD;

"IN SILENCE A~D 1N TEAR5.~~&#xD;
&#xD;
concluded the evening with Gottschalk's "Last Hope."&#xD;
There was a latent agony, and at the ~ame time a divine&#xD;
resignation in the piece, which harrowed while it soothed&#xD;
and the strange combination made it peculiarly fascinate&#xD;
~ ing to her. While playing, the tears trickled slowly&#xD;
down her cheeks, and as the last note floated away upon&#xD;
the midnight air, she bowed her head upon the music-&#xD;
rack and wept. The town clock pealed forth the hour&#xD;
of twelve; but distance had so softened each stroke,&#xD;
that they failed to arrest the attention of her who sat&#xD;
there, "in silence and in tears."&#xD;
The unmusical serenade of the Katydids jarred harshly&#xD;
upon the stillness which pervaded all space, and one poor&#xD;
little candle-fly flew around and around the lamp, caught&#xD;
by the false glare, which lured it to its death. A star or&#xD;
two peeped through the delicate lace curtains, the young&#xD;
moon sent silvery, shimmering beams through the open&#xD;
~indows, and silence reigned profound. It was the&#xD;
season in which charnel-houses yield up their dead, and&#xD;
had a ghostly figure, clothed in its winding-sheet, appeared&#xD;
upon the scene, it would only have been in keeping with&#xD;
the hour and the picture. But INland still leaned upon&#xD;
the music-rack, and was so absorbed, that a gentle footfall&#xD;
did not arouse her. The puritanical habits of the family,&#xD;
the scarcity of visitors, ahd the lateness of the hour, all led&#xD;
her to suppose herself free from intrusion. Imagine, then,&#xD;
how startled she must have been, when a voice near her&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"In tears?"&#xD;
The tone was sympathetic, ~nd in the familiar voice of&#xD;
the speaker, she recognized Colonel Hartridge, who had&#xD;
&#xD;
t~IN SILENCE AND IN TEAR5.~&#xD;
&#xD;
33.&#xD;
&#xD;
been spending the evening out, and had j~ist return4&#xD;
Such a thing had never occurred before, and if INland j~&#xD;
given him a thought she would have~ supposed him in the&#xD;
land of dreams some hours before. Why should he have .~&#xD;
spent this evening, of all others, away from home? and.&#xD;
if so, why should be return so late?&#xD;
Is there then indeed "a divinity that shapes our ends,&#xD;
rough-hew them how we will"?&#xD;
Trembling with fright at this unexpected interruption,&#xD;
IMlaud lifted her tear-stained face to the Colonel but to&#xD;
bury it again in her hands, while her whole frame was&#xD;
convulsed with suppressed sobs.&#xD;
Colonel Ilartridge was deeply moved, and Beating him.&#xD;
self beside her, said kindly:&#xD;
"Maud, tell me all that troubles you, and believe me, I&#xD;
will be a friend to you."&#xD;
But she could not speak for weeping, and yet these&#xD;
words fell as soothingly upon her lonely heart as balm&#xD;
poured into the gaping wound.&#xD;
"I know what your life is here, for I have seen enough,&#xD;
and my worst suspicions have been confirmed by what I&#xD;
have heard. Do not be afraid to trust me, but tell me in&#xD;
what way I can serve you."&#xD;
Choking back her sobs she faltered out:&#xD;
"Ion are too kind I "&#xD;
"Prove that you believe ~what you say by confiding in&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"It will soon be over now, for I shall leave here in a&#xD;
short tinie," she answered.&#xD;
"For what?"&#xD;
"To teach."&#xD;
"To teach!" he exclaimed, and in mournful sympathy&#xD;

added. "Poor child, you are young to battle with the&#xD;
world."&#xD;
"Yes; but I shall welcome the day which takes me&#xD;
hence;" then remembering the lateness of the hour, she&#xD;
arose. ~" I must go now, but allow me to thank you&#xD;
sincerely for the unexpected sympathy you have extended&#xD;
towards me;" and while her hand rested in~ his, she forced&#xD;
back the tears which sprang to her eyes again.&#xD;
"Maud, I love you, and would take you from the lonely&#xD;
life you lead here," was the reply of this honest, straight-&#xD;
forward man.&#xD;
Was ever declaration of love more simple-more true?&#xD;
Was she dreaming? Did she hear aright ~' And as sur~&#xD;
prise suc~ed~'d astonishmentshe gazed into his face with&#xD;
a bewild6r~ look, but to see his words reiterated in the&#xD;
frank expression which beamed therefrom. There could&#xD;
be no deception in those eyes so wonderfully mirroring&#xD;
the deep emotiQn~ which stirred his saul and she was&#xD;
reassured of it, when he continued:&#xD;
"Will you come with me? I have a home in which&#xD;
you shall reign-queen. My wealth shall be at your&#xD;
eoinmaud, and the dark days you have known here shall&#xD;
be blotted from memory, by new and ever-changing&#xD;
pleasures. Will you be mine, Maud?" and he pressed the&#xD;
hand that lay in his, tP his lips.&#xD;
She cEorgot in that hour how she had disliked him. She&#xD;
ignored the difference in their years, and thought only of&#xD;
the kind words which fell like a soothing benediction&#xD;
upon her hungry soul. Yet it was so unexpected that her&#xD;
lips c6uld not frame a, reply, and she stood before him&#xD;
trembling like a frightened bird, and blushing in coy,&#xD;
half shamefacedness. At length she looked trustingly&#xD;
&#xD;
"IN SILENCE AND IN TI~AR5.~~&#xD;
up into the manly face, that watched her ev~ry breatb,&#xD;
and murmured innocently, as if not knowing what else to&#xD;
say:&#xD;
"I must go now."&#xD;
"Not without a promise," said he, detaining her quiv.&#xD;
ering hand.&#xD;
"Will you answer me to-morrow?"&#xD;
"To-morrow !" she 'echoed, as if not, comprehending&#xD;
exactly what lie said.&#xD;
"Yes, to-morrow. Will you to-morrow answer what I&#xD;
have asked you to-night?"&#xD;
"Yes," he whispered. "Good-night!" and was gone.&#xD;
Sitting down by a window in the moonlight, he thought&#xD;
on wh~t he had done; and no regret mingled with iho&#xD;
joy tJ4t filled his heart.&#xD;
SI~ was beautiful, he loved her. She was lonely, he&#xD;
would comfort her. But would she permit it?&#xD;
"Aye-there was the rub 1" The future only ceuld&#xD;
tell.&#xD;
The young girl who had just parted from him sat also&#xD;
in the moonlight-and thinking too. But the one ab~&#xD;
scoring topic of her thoughts was the prospect of quitting&#xD;
forever that hated roof. She cared little whose hand it&#xD;
might be who should release her from the thraldom of&#xD;
mind and spirit by which she was tortured, so it was ae~&#xD;
coinplished; and her dreams wer&amp;amp; only of anticipated&#xD;
release, such as the caged bird may be supposed to-&#xD;
experience.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
FRAILTY7 THY NAME 15 WOMAN!~~&#xD;
AIITD was a living example of this stinging epi~&#xD;
gram, as she sat'one morning reflecting.&#xD;
her reflections were rather complicated, for&#xD;
she found herself the unintentional and double object of&#xD;
two engagements, and in what manner to dismiss the one,&#xD;
* was much more perplexing than the consummation of&#xD;
matters with the other. It was quite evident that she&#xD;
could not be married to both of them; the moral code'&#xD;
forbid!&#xD;
at To break the news as gently as possible to George, and&#xD;
the same time to retain his friendship, was the earnest&#xD;
Aesire of her heart, but could it be accomplished, and if&#xD;
so, how? He had been the friend of tier childhood, her&#xD;
girlhood,. and the avowed lover of her womanhood. Did&#xD;
~ it not seem like heartless ino'ratitude to abandon him fQr&#xD;
a stranger?&#xD;
It is to be regretted, that women are guilty of such&#xD;
irregularities, but when the false education which teaches~&#xD;
them to be. so utterly regardless of their word is remein-&#xD;
j, ber~d, they are perhaps as much to be pitied as censured&#xD;
Suppose the same dishonor was attached to female flirts~&#xD;
which stigmatizes. men of the same profession, would&#xD;
~ hero not be a better state of affaii~s in society? It would&#xD;
~ be a restraint which is sorely needed; it would check that&#xD;
love of adulation which is the bane of so many, and would&#xD;
make earnest women instead of frivolous pleasure-seekei~.&#xD;
Under the present r4gim~, how few women contemplate&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;

marriage with any degree of seriousness. ~1'hey coquette /&#xD;
with first one and another, until waning beauty warns&#xD;
I them to "make their fortune," as it is called, ere it is too ~&#xD;
late. \$~'hen, with a sigh, at leaving all their former free~ /&#xD;
I&#xD;
dom, they wed some suitor, perchance for money or posi- /&#xD;
~ tion, and without ever giving a thought to the duties ,~'&#xD;
which nmst devolve upon wife and mother. itt thef&#xD;
same spirit of rashness, they forget that marriage i~ ~&#xD;
lifetime business, and not the folly of a day, which ma~&#xD;
be repented of, and committed no more.&#xD;
The intention is not to make this picture general, but&#xD;
every one knows some instances which answer'~he de~&#xD;
~ription, to say nothing of the hasty and ill-considered&#xD;
match&amp;amp;which daily occur, and which must as surely end&#xD;
in unhappiness, it is a rite as ancient as the world, and&#xD;
sanctioned as it is by the holy approval of Divinity, should&#xD;
be entered into with great solemnity.&#xD;
Maud did not love Ge6rge as a woman should love the&#xD;
man to whom she is to be united in wedlock, and no re~&#xD;
proach could have clirno' to her for this.~ But. she and all&#xD;
'~other women should be~ censured for encouraging the&#xD;
honest love of men, when they know they can never re-&#xD;
ciprocate it.t~ Here is where the dishon6'r lies. It is true,&#xD;
George took ~Maud's love quite as a matter of course; but&#xD;
then she might and ought to have undeceived 'him. Did&#xD;
she love the man to whom she was to be married? flee&#xD;
heart was touched by his generous sympathy, but did i~&#xD;
never occur to her that she would have, left that house&#xD;
under almost any circumstances? Were these the only&#xD;
feelings which she expected to sustain her in, all the long&#xD;
years which were yet to Zeome? Heaven forbid!&#xD;
She saw little of George nowadt~ys, for some excuse&#xD;

turned, him away almost every' time he called, but his&#xD;
eonfklirig nature suspected nothing, and whenever Maud&#xD;
1t~d offered him his ring, he had as often forced it back&#xD;
up~rn her finger; then ~Iie would blush, look quietly, and&#xD;
say nothing, and he was happy in the belief that he was&#xD;
belevod.&#xD;
Yt~cillation was crime here, was it not? Just at this&#xD;
uncomfortable stage of her reflections, Mr. Marlowe&#xD;
entered the library where she sat, with an open letter in&#xD;
'..~ his hand, and advancing to her said,-&#xD;
"I received an ansxver to my advertisement this morn~&#xD;
ing, from the President of the Female College at L-&#xD;
lie offers you a situation as assistant teacher of music,&#xD;
~ith a salary of three hundred dollars a year. It will&#xD;
bai~ely pay your board, but that's better than doing noth-.&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
Trembling from head to foot, she took the letter from&#xD;
his hand, and said timidly,-&#xD;
"Thank you-"&#xD;
"Thank you yes, or no? Which do you mean? Don't&#xD;
keep inc waiting when I have told you every thing that&#xD;
is in the letter. Tell me what reply I am to make-of&#xD;
course you are going;" and his eyes danced at the very&#xD;
thought of being rid of this daily reminder of his in-.&#xD;
famy.&#xD;
"I am very much obliged to you, but-but L-." and&#xD;
like a frightened child she could say no more.&#xD;
"But what? Out with it-out with it, and don't stand&#xD;
~there stammering and trembling '~s if you were afraid to&#xD;
speak; I've. never seen a woman who was afraid to do&#xD;
that yet," and his words were accompanied with meuac~&#xD;

"I shall not teach now," and she trembled as though&#xD;
confronting the arch..flend himself.&#xD;
"Not teach?" was the amazed exclamation. "What&#xD;
will you do, then? Do nothing and starve, I suppose;"&#xD;
and the sneer which parted his lips and made him more&#xD;
repulsive than ever was significant of The secret dread he&#xD;
entertained, lest she should remain a dependent upon his&#xD;
bounty for an indefinite period of time.&#xD;
Maud was burning with indignation, but by a grea$&#xD;
effort she controlled herself, and said, with apparent&#xD;
composure, "I beg that you. will give yourself no further&#xD;
trouble in regard to me, as I am-to be-married soon."&#xD;
As surprise succeeded indignation, he said:&#xD;
"But ~[ thought you told me George Stanley had never&#xD;
addressed you?"&#xD;
"Is he the only man in the world?" was the quiek&#xD;
rejoinder.&#xD;
"The only one who would ever be fool enough to&#xD;
court you," was the ungentlemanly retort.&#xD;
11ev blood boiled at this merciless tannt~, and yet she&#xD;
was completely in his power, without the necessary means'&#xD;
to quit his. home, or friends to ~.y to, and even at that&#xD;
moment with relief in sight~ her lonely and unprotected&#xD;
situation was experienced more bitterly than ever. For&#xD;
several minutes they stood eying each other in silence,&#xD;
as two antao'onists might do before the deadly contest&#xD;
begins; then drawing herself proudly and defiantly ~np,&#xD;
she said,-&#xD;
"Mr. Marlowe, I have endured your taunts and insults&#xD;
from childhood, and could I force myself to believe that&#xD;
my father knew your character as I know it, I should&#xD;
curse him in his grave for placing me in your ~h&amp;amp;ge j ~o&#xD;

far, you haVe embittered my whole life, and this CO~c&#xD;
ardly p~u't has been enacted all the better, because you&#xD;
thought I had no one to defend me-to-day it must end;&#xD;
~an~d I am happy ~o inform you, that a few weeks hence,&#xD;
Colonel llartridge, as my husband, will protect me against&#xD;
any more of your insults."&#xD;
The doors being open, these last words reached the ear&#xD;
of a certain visitor, as he descended the stairs, and&#xD;
instaut~y recognizing the familiar tones of Maud's voice,&#xD;
he entered the room unannounced, and* standing by her&#xD;
side said,-&#xD;
"lie is here to do it now."&#xD;
A cry of delight broke from her lips, and as he slipped&#xD;
his arm protectingly around her waist, her head sank upon&#xD;
his shoulder, and the tears which could be restrained no&#xD;
longer, burst forth. Marlowe was livid with ~uppressed&#xD;
rage, but in the sudden presence of Colonel Iiartridge&#xD;
his face became wreathed with smiles, thus giving an&#xD;
ocular demonstration of how a man can "smile and smile,&#xD;
and be a villain still."&#xD;
hi the twinkling of an eye, he changed his tactics, and&#xD;
with the best expression he could command, said, "Well,&#xD;
really, I must congratulate you both upon this unexpected&#xD;
but happy state of affairs," at the same time extending his&#xD;
hands to them in a friendly way. They were hastily&#xD;
withdrawn, as neither friend nor ward accepted the peace&#xD;
offering, and he retired a pace or two, as Colonel hart..&#xD;
ridge said,-&#xD;
* "I must reject both your proffered hands and congrat~&#xD;
ulations, Mr. Marlowe, until I know the cause of the dif4&#xD;
faculty which my timely presence terminated."&#xD;
"Oh, it was nothing," said Marlowe, with a forced smii~&#xD;
&#xD;
~FRAILTY, THY NAME IS WOMAN ~        41.&#xD;
*&#xD;
"only a slight misunderstanding between Maud and mya&#xD;
self. Come now, we must not quarrel-let us be friends."&#xD;
But Colonel Hartridge maintained a sullen silence, and.&#xD;
an uncompromising manner, while Maud attempted to dry&#xD;
her tears, and Marlowe looked as uncomfortable as he felt.&#xD;
They were all becoming quite nervous under the pr9tract-&#xD;
ed silence, when Mr. Marlowe made a final attempt at re~~&#xD;
conciliation, by saying:&#xD;
"Come, child, forgive me if I wounded you, for I did&#xD;
not intend to. Come, Colonel, we have nothing to quar-&#xD;
rel about. Come now, shake hands with an old man, who&#xD;
hopes he may not sue iii vain for pardon;" and as he ex-&#xD;
tended his hands again, a spirit of magnanimity, which ho&#xD;
was unable to appreciate, prompted both Naud and the&#xD;
Colonel to pi~ess them, and grant him that mercy which he&#xD;
never exercised towards others. But the reconciliation&#xD;
was only partial, for Maud's heart ached with bitter mem-&#xD;
ories, and Colonel llartridge suspected that there was&#xD;
more behind the scenes ~hau he yet knew. Nothing was&#xD;
said for a little while, until Marlowe broke th~ silence by.&#xD;
saying,-.&#xD;
"Now that you have forgiven me, I will no longer in.-&#xD;
trude;" but as he left the room, Colonel llartridge joined&#xD;
him, and when in the hall, said,-&#xD;
"Mr. Marlowe, I have made honorable proposals to&#xD;
your ward, and she has consented to become my wife at&#xD;
an early day. I shall demand an explanation of her, and&#xD;
if it confirms my suspicions of your treatment towards&#xD;
her, I shall \hlold you personally responsible, sir."&#xD;
lie was pale with ano-er as he spoke, and Marlowe wa~&#xD;
mute with terror.&#xD;
"For, my sake, let there be no more of this," said Mand&#xD;
&#xD;
*1&#xD;
&#xD;
, I&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8258-00000021"/>&#xD;
joining them. "Pray, let Mr. Marlowe go, and I will ex&#xD;
plain everything to you;" for, although she knew ho~v&#xD;
unjustly he had treated her, yet it was her sincere desire&#xD;
now to prevent a difficulty for what was past, and could&#xD;
not 1)0 helped.&#xD;
"That's right, child-that's right, child," said Marlowe,&#xD;
as he trenibled with fear. "You know I would not harm&#xD;
a hair of your head; you know how good I have always&#xD;
been to you, and how fond I always was of you, don't you,&#xD;
child? You can make it all right with the Colonel, can't&#xD;
you, Maud?"&#xD;
"Oh! yes," she said, quickly and impatiently. "Go&#xD;
on, please-go on, and I'll make it all right," and with&#xD;
these words she gently drew Colonel llartridge back into&#xD;
the lil)rarv, while Marlowe made a hasty retreat.&#xD;
"Well now, Matfd, since you have taken this matter in&#xD;
your own hands, I would like to know what it all means,"&#xD;
said the Colonel, as they seated themselves. But the ex-&#xD;
~itoment had l)een too much for her, and the depression&#xD;
which generally succeeds such scenes now manifested it-&#xD;
self in a fresh burst of tears. A natural delicacy induced&#xD;
the Colonel to forbear pressing an answer~so he waited&#xD;
until she was sufficiently calm to speak. After a while,&#xD;
between half-smothered sobs and falling tears, she said,&#xD;
"I assure you it~ is nothing. I believe it is not new or&#xD;
strange for a ward and her guardian to be at variance."&#xD;
"But it is something entirely new to me, for a man to&#xD;
insult a la~1y and go unpunished," was the gallant reply.&#xD;
"I should have become hardened to 'it in this time, for~&#xD;
I have knowii little else since misfortune and a father's&#xD;
ignorance placed me beneath this r~of twelve years ago.&#xD;
I caun~t force myself to believe that he knew these peo.&#xD;

pie as I do, or he would have talent me down into tho&#xD;
grave with him, rather than left me in their care;" and&#xD;
the tears gushed afresh.&#xD;
"You shall leave here instantly," said the Colonel.&#xD;
"But I have nowhere to go," she said, as she remem&#xD;
bered with bitterness the indifference of her relatives,&#xD;
and the scarcity of her friends.&#xD;
"You shall come with me. What's the difference be-&#xD;
tween now and a few weeks hence?" and folding her to&#xD;
his heart, lie kissed her beautiful brow with pride.&#xD;
"Bat I am not prepared;" and then, as she thought of&#xD;
her poverty, an expression of pain came over her face, and&#xD;
she said, "I have no trousseau.~~&#xD;
"That is of no consequence. Can it not be made after&#xD;
marriage, as well as before?"&#xD;
"It is not customary," she said, blushing deeply; then&#xD;
added quickly, "If I had my preference, it would be, to&#xD;
be married in a travelling suit, and leave at once."&#xD;
"how long will it require to have the travelling suit&#xD;
made?" asked the Colonel eagerly.&#xD;
"A day-or two days at farthest."&#xD;
"Get your hat; we will go and order it at once, and in&#xD;
two days' time will leave this accursed place forever. Do&#xD;
not worry about your trou~eau, for I will give you a&#xD;
carte-blanche to purchase it a week hence in New York."&#xD;
"Youi. are too good," said Maud, looking timidly up in&#xD;
his face. "No one has ever been so kind to me before,"&#xD;
and for the moment ~he forgot a certain life-long friend,&#xD;
who had been the only sunbeam across her darkened path.&#xD;

THE FEVER OF DELIGHT.&#xD;

THE FEVER OF DELIGHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIE sky was cloudless, and the sun was unusually&#xD;
brilliant, as it flooded the village of M-' one&#xD;
~wuiflg, in its golden beams. The dew still&#xD;
glistened on tho grass, and the wild woods rang with the&#xD;
matin songs of birds, but Colonel and Mrs. Ilartridge&#xD;
were many miles away, the ceremony having been per-&#xD;
formed at day~ dawn, and the train bore them swiftly on&#xD;
their bridal tour. It had been the dream of Maud's life&#xD;
to travel, to visit art-galleries, to linger in libraries, and&#xD;
to study the men and women who compose the great world.&#xD;
Now that this wish was to be so suddenly realized, she&#xD;
could scarcely believe it. The transformation had been so&#xD;
rapid that her brain was in a whirl; she was in a fever&#xD;
of delight, but, not belonging to the ecstatic~ school, l~er&#xD;
enjoyment was quiet rather than demQnstrative-it was&#xD;
the fever of the soul, drinking in deep, but silent&#xD;
draughts, as is always the case with the true lover.&#xD;
Colonel Ilartridge, who had travelled extensively, both&#xD;
in the Old and New Worlds, saw nothing specially worthy&#xD;
of note, so doze4 over his papers, and occasionally smiled&#xD;
proudly upon hi~ "beauteous bride."&#xD;
They were the most quiet couple imaginable, and a&#xD;
mere' looker-on might have concluded, naturally enoi~gh,&#xD;
that they had been married for years, instead of a few&#xD;

rarest devices. It wasall so new and strange tQ her, though,&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;

that each fresh token of love was received with the tears&#xD;
which spring from a grateful heart. From the Metropo-&#xD;
lis they sallied forth upon the tour common to pleasure&#xD;
seekers, and so rapidly did they travel that it seemed as&#xD;
though gazing at kaleidoscopic views, which changed&#xD;
while they still looked, thus causing that flrs~ launch on&#xD;
the broad ocean of life to appear to Maud like some&#xD;
gorgeous vision, which was too beautiful to last. Col-&#xD;
onel Ilartridge was all goodness and kindness, but he and&#xD;
his young wife were unusually reticent towards each&#xD;
other, and Maud found, to her chagriu, that she conversed&#xD;
fluently with others, while at a loss to talk to her husband.&#xD;
Married people should struggle against this state of things&#xD;
with all the earnestness of their souls, for thus living to-&#xD;
gether and yet apart, may eventually lead to misplaced&#xD;
confidences. They should know every thought of each&#xD;
other's hearts, and no one else should own the sacred'&#xD;
privilege of entering the "sanctum sanctorum." The&#xD;
human heart must and will have sympathy and love, and&#xD;
perchance it may l)e bought at a price which would be&#xD;
fearful, even to whisper. Talk about self-sufficiency!&#xD;
there is no such thing, for the holy Book says, "no m~n&#xD;
liveth unto himself, and no man dieth unto himself."&#xD;
They who prate of being self-supporting may deceive the&#xD;
world, and hide.~ from its curious gaze the yearning for&#xD;
congeniality and affection which burns within their hearts,&#xD;
but the feeling will be there all the same, and the clamor&#xD;
will' never cease, until silenced by love expended, and love&#xD;
returned.&#xD;

on board ship, and anchored in sight of the gem of Geor&#xD;
gia, the "Forest City!" The sail from New York had&#xD;
been pleasant, but entirely devoid of any incident worth&#xD;
mentioning. Maud had won the hearts of the passengers&#xD;
by her kindness and charm of manner, and thus moving&#xD;
in the circle which she was born to grape, her timidity&#xD;
was fast yielding to an ease and elegance of manner&#xD;
which is only found in refined and polished society. her&#xD;
beauty elicited much admiration, and it was already evi~&#xD;
dent that she was destined to become a favorite. She&#xD;
1~oked unusually lovely that day, as standing on deck&#xD;
her eyes turned longingly to the spot that was to be her&#xD;
future home.&#xD;
"A penny for your thoughts, Maud," said her husband&#xD;
just then.&#xD;
"I was wondering if my intuition could designate the&#xD;
location of my future home."&#xD;
"I certainly hope that your intuition will do nothing&#xD;
of the kind, as I desire that honor myself; besides, you&#xD;
cannot see the private, residences from here."&#xD;
A sweet smile and a look of gratitude expressed what&#xD;
she felt, but did not say. After landing, adieux were&#xD;
hastily spoken, and in the confusion ~. securing luggage,&#xD;
and gai fling the carriage, the subject was dropped, and&#xD;
not renewed. -&#xD;
From the wharf to the door of his residence, the' Cob&#xD;
onel was bowing and smiling to old friends, while Maud&#xD;
leant back in the carnage, and feasted her eyes upon the&#xD;
beauties which burst upon her at every step, and which&#xD;
forced her, at first sight, to believe all and more than she&#xD;
had yet been fold of this "Kingdom by the Sea." Eu~&#xD;
tin~ely oblivious of the admiring glances which were be~&#xD;

stowed upon her, she was entertained by examining the&#xD;
stately residences empowered in vines and evergreens;&#xD;
by looking at the broad avenues, with their double rows of&#xD;
forest trees, and by watching the myriads of children&#xD;
playing in the squares. These pleasurable impressions&#xD;
increased with each step, until the acme of her dreams&#xD;
was realized, as stopping near the "Pulaski Monument"&#xD;
Forsyth Park" lay spread out before them in all its&#xD;
1)eanty and loveliness. The gorgeous tints of gold and&#xD;
red foliage were heightened by a brilliant autumnal sun,&#xD;
the fountain splashed and danced like so many diamond&#xD;
dew-drops, and in a burst of enthusiasm Maud exclaimed:&#xD;
"how beautiful! Why it's fairy-land!" and as she&#xD;
drank in the whole picture with the discrimination of&#xD;
her poetic nature, her husband watched her, and was'&#xD;
happy in her happiness.&#xD;
Failing to observe that the carriage had stopped, she&#xD;
was a little startled when her husband said:&#xD;
"Maud, we are home!,'&#xD;
Looking 'around then, for the first time, she saw that&#xD;
they had di'awn up before a palatial residenc9, and hastily&#xD;
alighting they entered their' beautiful home.&#xD;
When within the vestibule, the Colonel folded his fair&#xD;
young bride to his heart, and said, kindly:&#xD;
"Mand, everything here Js yours, and my prayer is&#xD;
that you may find it in truth, "Home, sweet home."&#xD;
"I echo your prayer, for it is something~ I have never&#xD;
known;" a~nd for the first time in two months the team&#xD;
sprang into, her eyes.&#xD;
Was it a happy or unhappy omen to enter her future&#xD;
home thus tearfully?&#xD;

asked in a considerate manner, as she stood in the v~sti.&#xD;
~ bule examining some statues which filled the niches.&#xD;
"Oh, no," was the cheerfuljesponse, "I shall be only&#xD;
too happy to be introduced at once to my new, or rather,&#xD;
J$rst home."&#xD;
"Let bygones be bygones, Maud, and try, for my sake&#xD;
to be happy in the present."&#xD;
In making a hasty survey of the rooffis, she saw&#xD;
that all the appointments ~were in the richest, as well as&#xD;
most tasteful keeping. The walls of the rooms, as well&#xD;
as those of the halls, were artistically frescoed-the car-&#xD;
pets were of the rarest Turkish designs, while copies&#xD;
from the old masters were gracefully suspended from&#xD;
the walls; antiques and French bronzes adorned the man-&#xD;
tels, and all things bespoke wealth and refinement of taste.&#xD;
At length they stood iii the sitting-room, and as ColoneL&#xD;
lllartridge opened a window which led into the ~onserva~&#xD;
tory, the most delicious odors filled the air, while a canary&#xD;
that hung in an orange tree trilled a merry welcome, and&#xD;
a miniature fountain sent gentle sprays of water softly&#xD;
upwards.&#xD;
"Do I dream, or is it reality?" said Maud, as her very&#xD;
soul drank in the beauties by which she was surrounded.&#xD;
"It is reality, INland, and all yours," said the Colonel,&#xD;
with a smile of intense satisfaction.&#xD;
"Everything is so bea~itiful-so new and strange-sc&#xD;
different from my dull, cold life at th~ Marlowes'-that&#xD;
I think I must be dreaming. I will go to my room now,&#xD;
and to-morrqw will finish the survey of my fairy doma~ins.&#xD;
There's too much now. I am as one intoxicate4 with&#xD;
some bewildering drink," and in a fit of apparent e4~au~&#xD;
she sa&#xD;

&#xD;
"Why not rest here?" asked her husband, with tender-&#xD;
ness, as he leant over and kissed her brow.&#xD;
"I prefer being alone, for I am really very weary."&#xD;
"Why, certainly; come, and 1 will show you. to your&#xD;
rooms.~,&#xD;
As they ascended the stairs to her apartments, new&#xD;
beauties greeted her at every step, until she felt that she&#xD;
would like to close her pyes, and see no more, for that&#xD;
day at least. While removing her hat and wrappings,&#xD;
the Colonel said:&#xD;
"1 will leave you npw, Maud, for a sight of my long-&#xD;
deserted office. Try an~ get a nap, and be bright at din-&#xD;
ner. Would you like a cup of tea or coffee?"&#xD;
"Ko, thank you, nothing ~now."&#xD;
"Good-by, then;" and a moment afterwards the door&#xD;
closed, and she was alone. Springing up, and turning&#xD;
the bolt, she threw herself upon the bed and wept9 Was&#xD;
it from nervousness, from undue excitement, or from&#xD;
some undefined foreboding? Thht such emotions at that&#xD;
hour were' ungrateful, she acknowledged, but there are&#xD;
some moments in life when the feelings burst forth in a&#xD;
torrent which cannot be controlled. Snatched from pov-&#xD;
erty and loneliness, and surrounded by every luxury that&#xD;
wealth could purchase, what more could be desired?&#xD;
Kind words fell upon her hungry heart, and still she ~at&#xD;

ChAPTER YIIL&#xD;
THE FEVER OF DELIRIUM.&#xD;
N a darkened chamber a man lay ill unto death.&#xD;
It was the hour of midnight, but the watchers&#xD;
showed no signs of~ drowsiness. The physician&#xD;
walked slowly, and noiselessly about the room, and his&#xD;
eyes were cast down, his hands folded behind him, and&#xD;
1 us face betokened unusual anxiety. An elderly woman&#xD;
sat before the fire, iii an arm-chair. witfr her face buried&#xD;
in her hands; and her low~ sobs, and heart-rending sighs,&#xD;
were but faint expressions of a mother's agony.&#xD;
A young woman sat by the bedside, pressing a bag of&#xD;
ice to the temples of the sufferer with one hand, while&#xD;
with the other she vainly strove to keep the cover drawn&#xD;
over him. Sometimes he would cry out in all the agony&#xD;
of conscious~ pain, at intervals lie would grow quiet and&#xD;
seem to be sleeping; and again, springing from the bed&#xD;
with superhuman strength, he would defy the power of&#xD;
his nurses to hold him, and rushing up and down the&#xD;
room like a madman, shriek out:&#xD;
"Thud! Maud! Mand! Maud!"&#xD;
This would continue until, exhausted, he would sink&#xD;
into the arms of his physician, and by him be replaced&#xD;
in his bed, like a little child.&#xD;
"Curses on tl~at woman," muttered old Mrs. Stanlc~, as&#xD;
she bent anxiously over her only son.&#xD;
"Oh, mother!" cried her daughter in a tone of pain&#xD;
and disapproval.&#xD;
" With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured~ to&#xD;
&#xD;
you again," said Mrs. Stanley, as if COmi~uning with hei&#xD;
own conscience; "and my prayer shall be that Maud Liv-&#xD;
iifgstone shall have to drink of the same cup of bitterness&#xD;
which she has so remorselessly held to our lips."*&#xD;
"Oh, mother! dear mother, do not talk so again,"&#xD;
pleaded Mary, for she knew that that was not the spirit&#xD;
of Christ, which teaches men the divine nature of f~r~&#xD;
giveness.&#xD;
It had now been a month since the marriage of Maud&#xD;
had taken place, and in that fact can be discovered tho&#xD;
cause, indirect and direct, of George Stanley's subse~~juent&#xD;
dissipation and illness. When disease had finally made&#xD;
him powerless to resist or evade the kind entreaties of his&#xD;
mother and sister, they were enabled to keep him yt home,.~&#xD;
and not till then.&#xD;
It was during his illness that Mary had discovered in&#xD;
the pocket of oze of his vests a crumpled and soiled note&#xD;
which ran thus:&#xD;
"DEAR GICoRGE:&#xD;
I return your ring, and earne~tly beg pardon if I&#xD;
have misled you in regard to the true state of my feel-&#xD;
ings. I have always loved you as a brother, and as long&#xD;
as life lasts shall evet~ remember your unwavering kindness,&#xD;

THE FEVER OF DELIRIUM.&#xD;
&#xD;
ascribed to the young lover, in the most triumphant man.&#xD;
ncr, the happiness of the bridegroom, and, to his astonish'&#xD;
ment, the startling intelligence was received without corn~&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
George seemed as one petrified. ills heart stood still,&#xD;
and his tongue refused to give utterance to the thoughts&#xD;
which burned and seethed within him. He wondered if&#xD;
he had suddenly become demented, and asked himself&#xD;
whether or not his senses deceived him.&#xD;
And still old Marlowe talked of Mand-of llartridge&#xD;
-of his money-but George was silent, not even reply-&#xD;
ing to the taunt of hi~ tormentor, when he said:&#xD;
"It is a pity, Stanley, you let the old man cut you&#xD;
At these words th~ two men parted, and while Marlowe&#xD;
betook himself to some fresh scheming, the boy-lover fled&#xD;
on and on-~he scarcely knew whither. His heart was&#xD;
numb and cold rather than bleeding; his brain seemed&#xD;
chilled, and throbbed with slow pulses of despair; and&#xD;
when he found that his unguided footsteps had led him to&#xD;
the village cemetery, a strong impulse was upon him to end&#xD;
his unhappy life, and take up his abode in the "City of&#xD;
the Dead."&#xD;
Following his instincts, he soon reached th? family sec-&#xD;
tion, and cast hiniself in mute grief at the foot of his&#xD;
father's grave.&#xD;
lit was the first great sorrow of a boyish heart, that was&#xD;
as trusting and confiding a~ that of a child. It was the&#xD;
first great disappointment which had yet~ darkened ~his&#xD;
young life, and the cross was heavy, and the cup he&#xD;
*     drained filled with the bitterest of bitterness. When the&#xD;
fir~t outbreak of the surcharging of his pent-up feelings&#xD;
&#xD;
bad gushed forth and subsided, he tore open the note&#xD;
and, with hot, tearless eyes, read the words which forever&#xD;
dispelled the gay illusions of his youthful dreams. His&#xD;
trust in mankind was gone: the world was only a blank&#xD;
to Win-a meaningless page-a noisome bedlam: ho&#xD;
prayed to die!&#xD;
lie did not have sufficient force of character to endure&#xD;
sileiiee, nor yet the 'courage to take the life he would so&#xD;
willingly have resigned, in this moment of~overmastering&#xD;
weakness; and so from his honored father's resting-place&#xD;
he weiit forth, in a sort of stupid mania, and sought the&#xD;
lethe of oblivion in potent liquors.&#xD;
Maud's ingratitude to him made 'all the world appear&#xD;
false. lie did not pause to reflect how much of her love&#xD;
he had taken for granted; lie only knew he loved her&#xD;
wildly, madly; he only felt that she was lost to hiin-lost&#xD;
forever.&#xD;
There is nothing, happily, in after life, which can&#xD;
brino' with it the keen suffering' of the first disappoint.&#xD;
ment. Before that the world seems bright and joyous,&#xD;
despite phantom vagaries; after that the victim goes&#xD;
forth with a cloud over his pathway-~a shadow on hi~&#xD;
soul. Life is never the -same, and he is never the same.&#xD;
So absorbed was George in his own- reflections, that&#xD;
time slipped by unnoticed, and when he returned to the&#xD;
village, the sun had sunk in the vest, and earth was&#xD;
drawing around her the dusky veil of twilight.&#xD;
Entering the first one of those vile dens, called "bar~&#xD;
rooms," that curse the land, he called for brandy, and&#xD;
drank until his reason was dethroned, and memory, with&#xD;
all its haunting of the past, was drowned. It had been&#xD;
a rare thing for him to partake even of a "social ~&#xD;

&#xD;
so a small quantity, comparatively, of the fiery potion di~&#xD;
the work.&#xD;
After some hours of ..uproarious merriment, he SnC*&#xD;
cumbed to the stronger power, and would have fallen to&#xD;
the floor but for the aid of the bar-keeper, who placed hi in&#xD;
upon his own bed, as he thought, with a gleam of tri-&#xD;
uniiph, of the rich prize he had secured in this new con-&#xD;
vert to the vile habits which enriched his coffers.&#xD;
The news of Maud Livingstone's unexpected marriage&#xD;
soon spread over all the village and when George failed to&#xD;
return to his home at the wanted hour, the hearts of his&#xD;
motheiT and sister were filled with anxious fears. 'When&#xD;
the day had passed into the night and he caine not, they&#xD;
were frantic. Seeking their nearest neighbor, Mary ex~&#xD;
planned the appr~nsions of her mother and herself, and&#xD;
besought him to go with her in search of her brother.&#xD;
But, after insisting upon her return home arid escorting&#xD;
her himself, this tried friend started on what seemed at&#xD;
first a fruitless mission. No one had seen George since&#xD;
early morning, and as ho never frequented thb haunts of&#xD;
drink, the thought did not suggestt itself that he might be&#xD;
an unconscious inmate of one of them. After several&#xD;
hours his retreat was discovered, and aboQt two o'clock&#xD;
heAvas borne, in a state of insensibility, to his home.&#xD;
The first tears shed over a son gone astray are like the&#xD;
first griefs, the bitterest; and such were the tears that&#xD;
Mrs. Stanley shed over poor, helpless George; tears,&#xD;
*     that the morning light saw dimming the sleepless eyes of&#xD;
the mother, and heavily dewing the pale cheek of the&#xD;
*     sister.&#xD;
The next day was far spent when George awoke and&#xD;
found. the sad faces of mcsther and sister watching over&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
him, and raising up he looked at them for a moment, then&#xD;
falling back, closed his eyes without speaking.&#xD;
"What will my darling boy have?" tenderly asked hi~&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
"Nothing," lie replied huskily.&#xD;
"Tell sister what troubles you," said Mary, in the&#xD;
gentle playfuhiess of their childhood, as she took his&#xD;
feverish hand and stroked it between her cool palms.&#xD;
"Don't you know, sister?" he asked, and turning his&#xD;
head a~vay he groaned heavily.&#xD;
"'Will you ~iot have some breakfast,~yson~"saidhi~&#xD;
anxious mother.&#xD;
"Breakfast, mother? why, how could I eat?"&#xD;
It was a sad little household .on that morning, and time&#xD;
only made it sadder. Soon the mother and sister retired&#xD;
from the room, and, after making his toilette, George'&#xD;
joined them; but their hearts were too full for the usual&#xD;
tide of family conversation, they noted the restless,, fitful&#xD;
maimer with which he wandered fm'orn room to room,&#xD;
with no intent, in silence. Ills thoughts were wholly hi~&#xD;
own, and a cloud of gloom, like a funeral pall, spread over&#xD;
the usually happy household.&#xD;
Against the earnest protestations of both mother and&#xD;
sister, George left the house, and again, before niightfaU,&#xD;
found relief from his oppression in tempting drink. 'riiis&#xD;
was but the beginning of a series of the most sickening&#xD;
debaucheries, an account of which would prove too revolt~&#xD;

attack which brought the pooi~ victim to death's door, and&#xD;

NOTICINGNG TO&#xD;

'(Auyvhing to pass away the time!&#xD;
\, Just anything!"&#xD;
&#xD;
HAT a commentary upon th~ present times I&#xD;
And yet there are a small class- who do not be-&#xD;
ye this period to be the most corrupt age of the.&#xD;
world. But certain it is that the poor have always had to&#xD;
drudge for the rich, and that only the few work from a&#xD;
sense of duty, while fewer still labor ~because they like it.&#xD;
Not only is this true of 'monarchical Europe, but of re-&#xD;
publican America, for whether the work is for aristocracy&#xD;
of blood, or aristocracy of money, one thing is quite# cer-&#xD;
%taill, and that is, that the labor has to be performed all the&#xD;
same. While this life-grin ding is going on among the&#xD;
lower Qiasses, enter the circles of fashion, and one will be&#xD;
amazed to find the members of it-especially the women-&#xD;
with absolutely nothing to do; their chief occupation con-&#xD;
sisting in devising means of passing the time, which hangs&#xD;
'so heavily ~ipon their pampered idleness.&#xD;
Were these women educated to comprehend that&#xD;
"Life is real, life is earnest,"&#xD;
&#xD;
~'~TOT1JELNG TO DO."'         57&#xD;
they might be zealous workers in the great vineyard.&#xD;
But sb long as the present superficial system of instruction&#xD;
continues, so long as women are reared with the idea that&#xD;
they have nothing to do but cultivate their physical&#xD;
beauty, dress, and run the gauntlet of the marriage mar-&#xD;
ket to advantage, just so long will they be the giddy but-.&#xD;
terilies of fashion one finds them; with now and then an&#xD;
earnest soul struggling for something higher, only to be&#xD;
dragged down by gossips and critics. The ballot-box is&#xD;
not what is asked for not what is needed, but a more&#xD;
thorough education for women.' Is it not the mother who&#xD;
has the training of her offspring? She must not be un-&#xD;
sexed in the blind wisdom of fanaticism, nor robbed of a&#xD;
single feminine attribute, but to make "a perfect womam&#xD;
nobly planned," she must be intellectua~y, but not ma~&#xD;
cuhinely strong. She must be allotted some nobler mis.&#xD;
sion in life than conjuring up frivolous, and consequently~&#xD;
pernicious, ways of disposing of her time.&#xD;
They say they have "nothing to do."&#xD;
Nothing to do, when there is so much to be done?&#xD;
much misery to alleviate, so many heart-aches to soothe?&#xD;
When there are souls to save ?-when, perhaps, they are.&#xD;
endowed with the" ten talents"? Oh, daughter of Time,&#xD;
remember they will be required at the end, and do not&#xD;
forget the fate of the 'barren fig-tree.&#xD;
Every human being has duties. To sit idling erie's&#xD;
time away is a grievous omission, to say the least of it;&#xD;
and judging by Christ's estimate, will be accounted as ~in~&#xD;
As is usual with people who have absolutely nothing to&#xD;
do, Maud Irartridge became fascinated with the round of&#xD;
gayety in which she lived; and found that time hung&#xD;
grievously heavy on her hands, unless there was some e~*&#xD;

NOTHING TO DO.&#xD;
&#xD;
excitement or amusement always in contemplation. On one&#xD;
of these many idle days she lingered with Guy Witherell&#xD;
in the breakfast-room, talking. Colonel Ilartridge had&#xD;
gone to his business long before, as had every one else&#xD;
who was so fortunate as to have any. As Guy had neither&#xD;
duties nor employment, it was natural that he should&#xD;
seek the society of those similarly situated; and thus it&#xD;
was that he wasted the golden hours of his youth, either&#xD;
in the society of frivolous women, or with those gentlemen&#xD;
of elegant leisure, who lounged around hotels, drove fast&#xD;
horses, and frequented club-houses, lie was but a type&#xD;
of a certain class of young men, who have no higher am-&#xD;
bition than to live in idle extravagance upon the hard-&#xD;
earned savings, which, by industry and economy, their&#xD;
fathers have amassed. lIe had a good mind, and l)y&#xD;
study and application, could have gained an honorable if&#xD;
not an eminent position among his fellow-men. his father&#xD;
had given him the best advantages, and had expended&#xD;
large sums of money upon his education. But, cui bono?&#xD;
his highest aspiration seemed to be to make a clown of&#xD;
himself, for the amusement of the crowd into which he&#xD;
might chance tu fall-'4o "pick the banjo;" to "fiddle" a&#xD;
little; sing a good deal, and do nothing, generally. No&#xD;
amount of entreaty from his mother, nor threatening from&#xD;
hiss father, could induce him to change his course; and.&#xD;
thus he ~vent on his way rejoicing. Being a cousin of the&#xD;
first wife of Colonel llartridge, he had always been inti-&#xD;
mate at the house, and it soon became an establishedifact,&#xD;
that when in disgrace at home, he took refuge under the&#xD;
roof of his quasi cousin. The young ladies ~raved about&#xD;
his "love of a mustache," and declared that his mis-&#xD;
chievous blue eyes committed sad havoc with their hearts&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
59&#xD;
&#xD;
He was accordingly, exceedingly vain, and exerted his&#xD;
wonderful powers on willing subjects. His diminutive&#xD;
size prevented him frdm ever being accounted a hero or a&#xD;
soldier, but lie seemed content to play the r51e of carpet~&#xD;
knight, and hear silly women declare he was "the dearest&#xD;
little fellow in the world."&#xD;
In reply to remonstrance from his parents, Guy would&#xD;
say,-&#xD;
"What difference does it make whether ; I do anything&#xD;
or not? I am just as highly respected as the most ol&#xD;
men. My associations are with the 'first people,' and I&#xD;
am sure I have the undisputed entree of the 'best so-&#xD;
ciety.' So what does it matter?" True, but he forgot,&#xD;
or failed to realize, that his position was purchased with&#xD;
his father's gold. What if those riches should "tak~&#xD;
unto themselves wings and fly away"? It is altogether&#xD;
possible, nay highly probable, that the doors of the "first&#xD;
people" would be closed against, and the entree into the&#xD;
best society denied him. He would then necessarily be&#xD;
thrown upon his own resources, and what talents he had&#xD;
been endowed with by nature would be called into re-&#xD;
quisition, perhaps, to keep him from starving. It is an&#xD;
np-lull business either to study a profession, or fornm habits.&#xD;
of industry late in life; and those who make the attempt&#xD;
find this inevitably true. No more mornings idled away&#xD;
in silly talk to idle pretty women; no more lounging&#xD;
around hotels, but. work, work must be the order of the&#xD;
day. Why is it that the purse-proud sneer at those who&#xD;
labor, and contemptuously esteem them niere drudges-.&#xD;
"hewers of' wood and drawers of water" for the more&#xD;
dubiously fortunate? Was anything good, great, or&#xD;
glorious ever accomplished without daily apphicatio~j ~&#xD;

Then such efforts should be encouraged, instead of being&#xD;
condemned. On the other hand, if a man works his.&#xD;
up in the world, he will steadily hold his position, and be&#xD;
altogether independent of the freaks of the fickle goddess.&#xD;
If she frowns upon him, he laughs in her face, and whis-&#xD;

to fight out the battle of life alone, no matter how fierce&#xD;
the contest, or weary the marches, or steep the ram-&#xD;

With the easy manner of being quite :at home, Guy&#xD;
had thrown himself on a lounge, and was evidently enjoy~&#xD;
ing to the fullest extent the fragrant cigar he held be-&#xD;
tween his sans souci lips.&#xD;
IMland was sitting near him, listening, rather than talk-&#xD;
- ing, and petting her two dogs. "Tiny," a little black~&#xD;
and-tan terrier, .~ nestled cosily in her lap, and as she&#xD;
stroked her, "Carl," a splendid Xewfoundland, laid at&#xD;
her feet; and' looking wistfully up into her face, seemed&#xD;
tosay: "Love motoo!"&#xD;
An affectionate stroke now and then, on his head, quite&#xD;
satisfied his jealousy, and closing his great black eyes,&#xD;

he fell asleep. Just then, Guy was saying, "Come, co;&#xD;
don't worry about 'Lucille;' her foot will soon be welL"&#xD;
"I am sure I hope so."&#xD;
"And if it isn't, I'll try my skill upon it."&#xD;
"Thanks, Guy; I wish you w' old. For aside from&#xD;
her suffering, I miss my daily ride sadly."&#xD;
"And mine are very lonely without you. It has 110W&#xD;
been more than a week since our last ride to I3onaven~&#xD;
ture."&#xD;
"Oh, that weird, lovely spot, that beautiful 'city of the&#xD;
dead.' It has haunted my memory ever since we were&#xD;
last there!"&#xD;
She closed her eyes as if to recall the beauteous picture,&#xD;
which was firmly engraved upon her recollection, and&#xD;
then opening them, said, a little sadly and in much eam&#xD;
nestness:&#xD;
"It would almost reconcile me to dying, if I knew It&#xD;
could be buried there, with those grand~ old oaks keeping&#xD;
sleepless vigil over me, and the long moss, as it sways&#xD;
in the winds, chanting never-ending requiems."&#xD;
Were her words prophetic, or only some idle fancy of&#xD;
*tbe brain?&#xD;
"Well, I. am quite sure if I could be translated, to say&#xD;
nothing of suffering, dying, and being buried, I should&#xD;
not be reconciled to the thought of leaving this wodd~&#xD;
It is good enough for inc."&#xD;
But Maud did not notice Guy's reply. Her thoughts&#xD;
seemed wandering, and she gazed vacantly into space.&#xD;
For a few ijilmites not a word was spoken; but the si~&#xD;
lence was at length broken by Guy.&#xD;
"Well, if you intend to sit there looking as mournful&#xD;

a hasty exit.&#xD;
"Oh, Guy!" fell faintly upon his ears, as he reached&#xD;
the front door, and smiling, said to himself triumphantly,&#xD;
"too late! ~na lelle."&#xD;
An unusual depression played upon Maud's spirits,&#xD;
that morning, and she roamed around the house as if in&#xD;
search of something, she scarce knew what. At length,&#xD;
the syren music enticed her, and in its soothing melodies&#xD;
she quaffed "the kind nepenthe," for which her restless&#xD;
and weary soul thirsted.&#xD;
Thus day after day passed away, and when the calen-&#xD;
dar had told six mouths, they seemed not as many days.&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
"HONESTY THE BEST POLIOY.~'&#xD;
flE weather had become suddenly very warm, and&#xD;
but for the refreshing sea-breeze which daily vis-&#xD;
.sive. ited the city, the heat would have been Oppres-&#xD;
Accustomed to tl~e bracing air of the mountains,&#xD;
became quite enervated, and Colonel Ilartridgc&#xD;
was 'making all haste to leave for his summer home on&#xD;
Lookout. Being engaged in the conservatory one eve-&#xD;
ning, wateringg her flowers, she was surprised to have hem&#xD;
husband join her, for the hour was earlier than he ~en&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
rally came from his office. lie seemed in unusually&#xD;
buoyant spirits, as laughing, lie said:&#xD;
"See, Maud, read the P. S. to this letter and say what&#xD;
~ shall do."&#xD;
Taking the opeu letter from his hand, she read ~&#xD;
"If you come up-country this summer, we shall be glad&#xD;
to see you with iNtaud at our house.&#xD;
Again, truly yours,&#xD;
J~ T. MAL~own."&#xD;
The bitter recollections of the dreary years that were&#xD;
past and gone, rushed over her like a torrent; and filled&#xD;
with these memories, she tossed the letter aside, aud said,&#xD;
with deep feeling'&#xD;
"I would rather die thaii ever enter tiiat house again!"&#xD;
"Why, Maud ?" said her husband, laughing at the&#xD;
childish impatience of her manner, as he stooped to pick&#xD;
up the despised missive she had dropped from her hand,&#xD;
as if its touch might defile; "iou must forgive, even as&#xD;
you hope to be forgiven. Why may we not stop a day9r&#xD;
two to see the Marlowes on our route up to Lookout?"&#xD;
and he folded her in his arms as though she were a fright-&#xD;
ened bird. 11cr head rested confidingly on his shoulder,&#xD;
and the tears sprang to ~ier eyes, but her lips were sealed.&#xD;
Thus a few minutes passed, then gently lifting her head&#xD;
and looking into her eyes, lie said:&#xD;
"Will you not do this for my sake?"&#xD;
I~emernb~ring all his goodness and 1oving-kindnes~ to&#xD;
he~ she said, after a while:&#xD;
"If you desire it."&#xD;
It cost her, however, a bitter struggle, and a dart of&#xD;

anguish pierced icr heart as the words escaped her.&#xD;
But she was determined to keep her promise, aye, as&#xD;
bravely as ever martyr walked to death.&#xD;
"Come then, dry up those naughty tears. They make&#xD;
your beautiful eyes red, and their fringed lids swollen,"&#xD;
and he playfully kissed her pale brow. Then as if anx-&#xD;
ious to change the subject, which he fancied gave her use-&#xD;
less pain, he asked:&#xD;
"What are you going to do with your flowers?"&#xD;
"I was just giving William parting directions about&#xD;
them. I think of taking my birds and dogs with me."&#xD;
"Why, Maud, who ever' heard of such a thing?" and&#xD;
he laughed long and heartily. Maud looked surprised,&#xD;
and perhaps a little offended, at the thought of his treat~&#xD;
ing her pets with such disrespect, and said timidly:&#xD;
"That is, if you do not object."&#xD;
"No, dear, assuredly not. Besides, who knows' but&#xD;
the poor things need a change of air ;" and as they passed&#xD;
into the sitting-room he laughed still more heartily as he&#xD;
bethought himself of the absurd figure he would pre%&#xD;
sent, travelling with a bevy of birds, and a troop of&#xD;
pet dogs. Maud felt happier that evening than she&#xD;
had for a length of time, but her happiness was destined&#xD;
to be of short duration; even as brief as a ray of sun-&#xD;
light piercing the storm-cloud. Why did not her hue-&#xD;

A stream of light poured invitingly from the library4&#xD;
and entering this favorite room, Colonel iiartridge settled&#xD;
himself to his papers, while iMlaud resumed ,~ book she&#xD;
had been reading. Her eyes rested upon the open page,&#xD;
but the leaves were not turned, and while sitting in this&#xD;
mood, and looking at her husband, she thought ~" How&#xD;
happy we might be!"&#xD;
Oh, that word "might!" It is the death knell of so&#xD;
many fond hopes-the last clod upon the grave wherein&#xD;
are buried, one by one, the joys of life!&#xD;
A week later Colonel llartridge and Maud were the&#xD;
guests of Mr. and Mrs. Marlowe. A careless observer&#xD;
would have said that both place and people were un~&#xD;
changed; but iNland Jlartridge, who thoroughly compare~&#xD;
headed the situation of affairs in the household of her&#xD;
host, noted full well the harder lines that had crept&#xD;
around Mrs. Marlowe's lips, and that ~he wrinkles had&#xD;
deepened on her forehead. She was a trifle more sallow,&#xD;
and a trifle thinner, while her restless eyes and uneaq&#xD;
manner betokened something wrong within. Strange'to.&#xD;
say, she conducted herself toward Maud more like &amp;amp;&#xD;
fawning inferior than the stern superior of other days.&#xD;
"My dear Maud!" seemed forever on her lips, an epi~&#xD;
thet to which they were not tutored when the, young&#xD;
orphan girl hungered for a word of kindness, 'a b~re&#xD;
breath of affection..&#xD;
Marlowe was the same whited sepulchre;" pQlished,~&#xD;
without, as ashen as Dead-sea fruit at heart, and disgust.&#xD;

~H0NE5TY THE BEST rOLICY.~~&#xD;
He found many topics for discussion with Colonel&#xD;
Uartridgc, as inca always do, and their former disagree-&#xD;
meat seemed entirely forgotten. When business, politics,&#xD;
or current every-day events are the topic of the hour,&#xD;
men, though they be at enmity, may pass the time as&#xD;
si noothly as thbse who are friends. This is not usually&#xD;
the case with women: they are perhaps not more honest&#xD;
l)ut less politic then men, and where there is dislike, there&#xD;
is very little chance for the exercise of the genial ameni-&#xD;
ties of life bet~veen them. Women are commonly indif-&#xD;
ferent diplomatists. They rarely teach themselves to&#xD;
control the real state of their feelings; and their inter..&#xD;
course, if the entente cordiale does not obtain, is naturally&#xD;
constrained and uncomfortable.&#xD;
Mrs. Marlowe and her orphan charge had no sympathy&#xD;
of feeling, and Maud, thinking it was rather late to begin&#xD;
the cultivation of such sentiments, absented herself, as&#xD;
much as courtesy would permit from the family circle.&#xD;
~he had been a day and a night in the house, but had&#xD;
spemit only a few hours in the society of her hostess.&#xD;
Colonel llartridge kindly entered a protest ag~im~st such&#xD;
conduct on the pert of his wife, but it was of no avail.&#xD;
Within her chamber she sat, looking sadly out of the&#xD;
window at the village that lay stretched before her.&#xD;
Memory was busy and carried her back to that cruel day&#xD;
when her father was snatched front her; and yet a little&#xD;
farther back and the brokemi shaft of her iriother's tomb&#xD;
rose up before her, and burying her face in her hands,&#xD;
she strove to shut out the past with its many reminis-&#xD;
cences, and cried in the bitternessof her bleeding heart:&#xD;
"Ohm God! why were these things so?'~&#xD;
~he indulged those unhappy reflections, however, bat&#xD;
&#xD;
~HONESTY THE BEST POLICY.~&#xD;
&#xD;
67&#xD;
&#xD;
~or a momeflt,-then brushing away the great tears that&#xD;
rose up in her eyes, and dimmed her sight, she gazed as&#xD;
before through the window.&#xD;
Everything in the panorama was the same as of old,&#xD;
but they were endeared by no youthful associThon, and&#xD;
not a single object brougilit the least joy to her heart.&#xD;
,~ Persons generally revisit the scenes of their childhood&#xD;
with pleasure; l)ut they are those xvho have there been&#xD;
tenderly cherished, and whose early years were not disci-&#xD;
plined in the school of adversity. There were the same&#xD;
walks which her feet had pressed so often and so wearily,&#xD;
as she bent her steps to the college within whose walls&#xD;
she was a comparative stranger; for her timid and sensi~&#xD;
tive natur~aehd her aloof from the conventional intima-&#xD;
cies of schoolmates.&#xD;
Piercing its slender shaft through the trees was to be&#xD;
seen the spire of the village church, at whose altar she&#xD;
had learned that the lips may falsely utter those words&#xD;
which find no response in the heart. There were th~&#xD;
same tasteful flower-gardens, either brightening the hum~&#xD;
ble cottage, or lending an additional charm to the abode&#xD;
of the wealthy. Occasionally, a carriage would drive&#xD;
slowly by, and in its occupants she would recognize some&#xD;
familiar faces. She could not call them friends, and&#xD;
there wa~ no desire in her heart for association with them,&#xD;
so she sat quietly in the embrasure of the window, oh-&#xD;
servino' without b observed, and lon~&#xD;
beino' o             sing for the hour&#xD;
of their departure. Did the rejected friend of her youth&#xD;
and loneliness claim no share in her thouo'hts? At&#xD;
length the door opened and as her husband entered he&#xD;
sai(l:&#xD;
"~[aud, gct ready; we leave in an hour."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
t -&#xD;
&#xD;
"Thank Heaven!" she cried, with much earnestness,&#xD;
and commenced preparations for departure at once.&#xD;
"I am going out with Mr. Marlowe, but will return ix~&#xD;
time" he said to her, as he left the room.&#xD;
"Do be quickie please," she pleaded, "or we may b~&#xD;
left," as she pressed hastily the spring of her watch.&#xD;
But he tarried, and smiled anxiously as he noted the&#xD;
state of her mind.&#xD;
"One might suppose, Maud, from what you say, this&#xD;
was a haunted house, or the abode of fiends."&#xD;
"If it were either one or the other I could not be&#xD;
more wretched than I am here."&#xD;
And she evidently meant what she said.&#xD;
"Well, we shall soon be gone," he murmured, leaving&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
"God speed the hour!', she replied, busily replacing&#xD;
some effects in her trunk. Then putting on her hat, she&#xD;
joined ~ Marlc~we.&#xD;
They had been conversing only a few moments on in-&#xD;
different topics, when, much to her relief, the gentlemen&#xD;
returned.&#xD;
Etiquette demanded, and Colonel llartridge extendedd&#xD;
an invitation to his host and hostess to return their visit,&#xD;
which Maud failed to second with l~er approval, and in&#xD;
her heart prayed they might think proper not to accept.&#xD;
Good-byes were hastily and coldly exchanged, and Maud&#xD;
was wicked enough not to care if the parting was for all&#xD;
time.&#xD;
From the first moment pf their arrival, in the village&#xD;
an undefined apprehension had seized upon her, and she&#xD;
felt a -secret dread lest some new trouble awaited her.&#xD;
She had not spoken of it, but the spectre stood befo'~a&#xD;
&#xD;
~1t&#xD;
&#xD;
her and would not "down at her bidding." So far nothing&#xD;
had occurred to justify her suspicions, and remembering&#xD;
that the train would shortly bear them away, she drew a&#xD;
sigh of relief. When they arrived in sight of the rail.&#xD;
road station they noticed a small group of men gathered&#xD;
around some one, and Maud's heart beat fearfully fast,&#xD;
when, stepping upon the platform, these wo~ds fell upon&#xD;
her ears:&#xD;
"I heard she was here, and, by Heaven, I'll see her, or&#xD;
die! I'll tell her to her face how she deceived me!"&#xD;
A desperate scuffle ensued, and the same voice was&#xD;
heard saying:&#xD;
"Let me go! L&amp;amp;~t me go "-then with a fearful oath,&#xD;
added, "or somebody will b~ hurt!"&#xD;
With superhuman strength the speaker wrested him-&#xD;
self from the men who held him, and the next instant the&#xD;
report of a pistol-shot sent terror through the hearts of&#xD;
the bystanders; fortunately it was discharged in the air&#xD;
or some innocent life might have paid the forfeit of&#xD;
such rashness. Several gentlemen now rushed forward,&#xD;
and while one seized the weapon, two others held th~ un-&#xD;
fortunate man. Ills fury having expended itself, he ab&#xD;
lowed his friend to lead him away, without offering re~&#xD;
distance. Sorrow now took the place of anger, and&#xD;
scarcely an eye was dry when they saw this strong hut&#xD;
deluded man moved to tears. This scene, in one of&#xD;
life's many tragedies, was enacted in a few minutes; -but&#xD;
what years of agony are sometimes compressed into the&#xD;
shortest space of time. True oiie lives not by th~ eold~&#xD;
calendar of days, but by their own deeds.&#xD;
Maud did not scream or faint, but stood as if riveted&#xD;
to the spot. Colonel llartridge seemed powerless, ~&#xD;

<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8258-00000035"/>&#xD;
70          ~HONE5TY TUE BEST POLTOY.~~&#xD;
to act, nor did lie stir from the spot until the scene wa~&#xD;
over.&#xD;
Then, as if suddenly recollecting himself, he hurried&#xD;
.Maud into the ladies' saloon.&#xD;
happily for her the crowd were so intent upon watch-&#xD;
ing the movements of this rude disturbed she had been&#xD;
unobserved. No word escaped her lips, but by her quiv-&#xD;
ering frame it was evident how intensely she suffered.&#xD;
l3eneath her drawn veil her tears flowed silently, while&#xD;
Colonel hlartridge walked the floor in a mood of excite-&#xD;
ment altogether unusual with him; and both were impa-&#xD;
tient to be gone.&#xD;
A few minutes passed thus, when the arrival of the ex-&#xD;
pected train aroused them to immediate action. Step-&#xD;
ping to the door of the saloon, the Colonel discovered, to&#xD;
his joy, that the crowd had dispersed with the object of&#xD;
this unfortunate occurrence. Hastily gathering up his&#xD;
effects, he said tenderly:&#xD;
"Come, Maud, we will go now."&#xD;
Only too glad to quit a place that was fraught with&#xD;
such harrowing memories, Maud followed quickly, but with&#xD;
a sad tremor, the footsteps of her husband. As the train&#xD;
bore them swiftly away a fervent prayer arose from her&#xD;
heart, and that prayer, could it have found vent in more&#xD;
titan a soul-surdiarging aspiration, would have been in the&#xD;
following words:&#xD;
"Oh, that I may be leaving this unfortunate locality&#xD;
forever."&#xD;
It is not difficult to recogilizo George Stanley in the&#xD;
author of this unhappy scene.&#xD;
Colonel llartridge and Maud sought a seat far apart*&#xD;
from the rest of the passengers; the one silent, and the&#xD;

other endeavoring to bury her feelings beneath a thick&#xD;
veil which covered her face. She had seen George Stan-&#xD;
ley but for a single moiient, but that moment had&#xD;
branded his iffiage on her memory for all time. It mat-&#xD;
tered not that her eyes were closed and a 'handkerchief&#xD;
pressed to them; the wreck of her boyish lover stood be-&#xD;
fore her, and cried for revenge. I~Iis clothes were soiled;&#xD;
his face haggard and flushed; his beard unkempt, and hi~&#xD;
hair hanging in tangled luxuriance over his broad shoul-&#xD;
dci's.&#xD;
"Oh, heaven! what a falling off was there."&#xD;
A victim to a blind infatuation, the disappointment&#xD;
which it brought had made him the slave of a vile habit;&#xD;
had blasted all the bright prospects of his youth; had&#xD;
driven his mother into an untimely grave~, and blighted&#xD;
all the budding hopes of an only and loving sister.&#xD;
Oh, woman! thou who shouldst save and not destroy-&#xD;
I thou who shouldst make virtue beautiful ~nd point the&#xD;
way to heaven, think on the ruin thy trifling may bring,&#xD;
and pause before permitting the bye of admiration to&#xD;
become the ruling passion of life.&#xD;
Maud might have been called the innocent cause of&#xD;
George Stanley's ruin, but the excuse seems flimsy, by&#xD;
the way of pretext, when rightly considered, for ~voinauI~&#xD;
candor might have saved him, and spared her the bitter&#xD;
pai~gs of an accusing conscience. ( Even granting her&#xD;
imloceucy, it is fearful to think of the sinfulness of those&#xD;
women whose chief delight seems to consist iii entangling&#xD;
the affections of the opposite sex~&#xD;

cries out, "Give! give !" her grasping heart hungering&#xD;
f~r flattery from every man. And if her sinfulness&#xD;
ended with the attainment of her object, there might be&#xD;
some hope; but feeding only stimulates such hunger, and&#xD;
gratification assumes the strange form of disappointment.&#xD;
This may seem paradoxical, but the inner-life of almost&#xD;
any-strictly speaking-woman of the world would verify&#xD;
the possibility of the paradox.&#xD;
Such a woman has no moral sense-no high4oned prin-&#xD;
ciple; her whole life is an acting falsehood; she is hcr~&#xD;
self a libel on her sex; her end, grievous. ~ She will&#xD;
never make a true wife, for the love of a ~ing1e honest&#xD;
heart would never satisfy the grasping desires of her owm~&#xD;
She cannot fill a mother's holy place, for the chief source&#xD;
of parental respect, confidence, is nullified, and the&#xD;
corner-stone of their education, truth, is put to the&#xD;
blush. The deadliest draught is not more poisonous to&#xD;
the stomach than to society and the family is the daily,&#xD;
heartless life of the avowed coquette. What though she&#xD;
may not reel upon the streets and carouse in dens of&#xD;
iniquity? There should, perhaps, be less excuse for her&#xD;
conduct than for the unfortunate profligate, for she acts&#xD;
with premeditation. On the other hand, the inebriate&#xD;
is for the time but the victim of fictitious excitement;&#xD;
the agent of a poison which permeates mind as well as&#xD;
body, detlirones intellect, and makes him temporarily&#xD;

stances of the first transgression in this particular for the&#xD;
cause to be disregarded. There is scarcely a person but&#xD;
can x'ecall some wreck Qf a man who sought to drown his.&#xD;
earliest ~ri&amp;amp;f~ in the. poisoned cup.! The habit was soon&#xD;
&#xD;
formed; the love of it grows upon t~ indulgence; the&#xD;
I~ubicon of this vice is rarely recrossed, as the wretched&#xD;
end of these martyrs too often attests.&#xD;
Of the many women who are the victims of bad men&#xD;
the world knows cornparati vely little. Their names ar~&#xD;
recorded only in the Book kept Above; but their wounds&#xD;
heal not without leaving deep scars, and yet, like Portia,&#xD;
they endure and suffer in silence, because the world to&#xD;
woman is so cruel. Yet'the poison is not the less deadly,&#xD;
or the less maddening because borne in secret, and it will&#xD;
bias her life for good or evil; it will tend to harden or&#xD;
soften; it will lead her through tribulation to the Ever-&#xD;
flowing Fountain, there to drink of Living waters and be&#xD;
healed, or drive her to recklessness or revenge. If to the&#xD;
latter, may God have mercy upon her soul!&#xD;
Is not honesty, then, the best policy?&#xD;
Colonel Jfartridge and Maud were at their mountain&#xD;
home. It had been a dreary fortnight for both of them.&#xD;
The trees were robed in their greenest verdure, the earth&#xD;
was carpeted with flowers of the brightest hue, the birds&#xD;
trilled their merriest roundelays, the sunbeams and the&#xD;
mbot~beains sent quivering rays into the secret nooks, and'&#xD;
all nature smiled invitingly, but Maud was still confined&#xD;
to a darkened chamber and took no note of anything.&#xD;
* The shock had been too severe for her, and utter nervous&#xD;
prostration had ensued. Her physician quieted the anx-&#xD;
ious fears of her h~band by assuring him that she was~&#xD;
in nodanger.N&#xD;
"Time must do the work, my dear sir, time will. he~d,~'&#xD;
- he would say, with a slight shake of the head and a mnP&#xD;
tered, deprecating "perhaps~"&#xD;

Poor old Time! when, remedies fail, and skill is baffled,&#xD;
he marches along with the same noiseless tread, and per~&#xD;
forms miraculous cures, that are never set down to his&#xD;
credit. It is well that this consulting physician knows&#xD;
what to do, or the turf might be green above many who&#xD;
are only suffering from "a mind diseased," or "a rooted&#xD;
sorrow."&#xD;
"If we could only persuade her to leave that room; if&#xD;
we could only divert the channel of her thou~lits, she&#xD;
mght be cured," said the doctor to Colonel Ilartridge&#xD;
'one day.&#xD;
"I Lave it!" exclaimed llartridge. "I will persuade&#xD;
her to let us carry her to "The Point" to-morrow. We&#xD;
will lunch and spend the day there. We can also carry&#xD;
a lounge, so she can rest when fatigued."&#xD;
his face brightened as lie spoke.&#xD;
"That done, the result will be all we can desire," an-&#xD;
swered the doctor.&#xD;
TJie day was long to both of theni; the night restless&#xD;
to Colonel Ilartridge and distressing to Maud, for she&#xD;
could not sleep. The morrow dawned bright and cloud-&#xD;
less, and the sick wife yielded indifferently to her bus-&#xD;
band's wishes. But her manner was so listless that he&#xD;
hoped for little. however, fortune favored him, and the&#xD;
unexpected arrival of Guy gave the impetus so inn c~u&#xD;
needed. lie supported one side of the inipromptu chair&#xD;
in which they carried her, and the woods echoed with&#xD;
their bursts of laughter. They ate, drank, and were merry:&#xD;
and the day flew by on rosy wings. Fatigue induced&#xD;
the sweet, refreshing sleep that night, which opiates had&#xD;
failed to bring; and from that 'date Mand steadily mi&#xD;
proved. In a week she was almost herself again, and&#xD;
&#xD;
quite able to join the daily excursions of their little&#xD;
party.&#xD;

for his yearly tril) North.&#xD;
It was impossible to 1111 his place, but among the daily&#xD;
arrival of visitors they found some friends, formed many~&#xD;
pleasant acquaintances, and the summer promised to pass&#xD;
To a close observer Maud's face was very sad at times,&#xD;
and a deep sigh betokened something wrong within. In&#xD;
her sleep she would start and cry, as if pursued by some&#xD;
avenging Nemesis.&#xD;
By consent, their late visit was never referred to, but&#xD;
the memory of it lingered in their hearts, and refused to&#xD;
be banished. Aye, more. The raven folded its sable&#xD;
wings above their door-way, and east a shadow across the&#xD;
threshold; and as he sat there croaking " nevermore!"&#xD;
their hearts echoed the refrain, and this cruel memory&#xD;
was banished " nevermore.~~&#xD;

'16              COUNTRY A~1D CITY.&#xD;
All nature gives praise unto Iiim~ who sits upon tim&#xD;
throne of the most high, but man, who is made in the&#xD;
image of his God, and who is only a little lower than the&#xD;
angels, clings to this sin-stained earth, and the clesii'e of&#xD;
his heai~t seems to be to put eternity between his Maker&#xD;
and himself. The contemplation of nature awakens a&#xD;
reverence, a solemnity, and an awe, that is never aroused&#xD;
by the works~ of man; and Moltaire, scoffer though he was,&#xD;
might have been a better and a purer man if he had&#xD;
- studied cities less and the country more.&#xD;
Men are but copyists at best, but if they would study&#xD;
closely the models fresh from the Almighty's hand, they&#xD;
might bring forth better works, and exalt themselves in&#xD;
so doing. Take Voltaire for example! ta man who was&#xD;
at one time the idol of France, the shining star of the&#xD;
age in which lie lived, the brilliant genius upon whom all&#xD;
Europe gazed, and see how perverted men will become,&#xD;
who ~vaiider away from The only true and living God, in&#xD;
search of new theories and strange dogmas. Born in a&#xD;
corrupt age, his effort seemed to have b~en to leave it&#xD;
more corrupt than lie found it. T6 him, religion was a&#xD;
moekery,-friendship, a name,-Aove, a myth-virtue,&#xD;
unknown - truth, a liai'- heaven, Utopia - and God,&#xD;
21 ~xm -mon. If he had locked these depraved sentiments&#xD;
in his own heart, and thrown the key into the bottomless&#xD;
pit, to the keeping of the demons who had aroused them,&#xD;
then. his crime might have been tortured into virtue.&#xD;
Btrt instead of this, his life and genius were devoted to&#xD;
the dissemination of his views among men. Almost. ~iiy&#xD;
religion is better than none, for there are few forms of&#xD;
worship that do not tend to improve their devotees.&#xD;
Even the heathen, when bowing down to the idol which&#xD;
&#xD;
COUNTRY &amp;amp;ND CITY.&#xD;
his own hands have created, but yields obedience to the&#xD;
instinct which dwells in his heart, and forces him to ~&#xD;
knowledge a superior power. If infidels and ath6ist~&#xD;
would take the trouble to look into the motives which&#xD;
urge upon these deluded creatures this form of worship,&#xD;
they might find something in their lives, strange as it&#xD;
~may sbem, worthy of imitation. Every one, no matter&#xD;
how insignificant, has some influence, and that power&#xD;
should be exerted for good, instead of evil. If the pun~&#xD;
isinnent is in accordance with the talents entrusted; woe&#xD;
unto those who, by their genius, attract the attention of&#xD;
men but to instruct them adversely to the divine doe~&#xD;
trines of Christ. If such persons would leave th~.&#xD;
crowded cities, where corruption seethes and boiLs; ~&#xD;
they would flee to the mountains, and, like them, lift&#xD;
themselves up to the heavens; if then they would pray&#xD;
for light, the sun of God's righteousness would hasten to&#xD;
come and flood their hearts with noon-day splendor.&#xD;
Earnest pleadings might then change places with impious&#xD;
tcachiugs,-and the world grow better instead of worse.&#xD;
Maud thought it was glorious to be in the mountains,&#xD;
and enjoyed there a feeling of freedom and liberty, which&#xD;
she had never known within the narrow limits of town&#xD;
or city.&#xD;
She had viewed the mountain in every aspect, now&#xD;
bathed in the most glorious sunshine, then enshrouded in&#xD;
mist, and had watched the storm-king when abroad with&#xD;
his legions of destruction, hurling rocks violently down to&#xD;
unfathotned abysses, while the trees were uprooted with&#xD;
the wind, and splintered ~by the l~ghtningandyer1had~&#xD;

grandeur in nature that filled her with awe, ~nd frequently&#xD;
she would remain upon some cliff, gazing at the clouds&#xD;
as they grew blacker, and listening to the massing of&#xD;
heaven's artillery, until the big drops would patter down&#xD;
and she would be drenched before reaching the houses A&#xD;
great dreamer, at other times she would sit for hours on&#xD;
"Point Lookout," and study the clouds as they floated laz-&#xD;
ily up from the silvery Tennessee, until, rising higher and&#xD;
higher, they would eilvelop her in their fleecy robes, and&#xD;
then fade away into the blue ether above, and be lost to&#xD;
~sight. Or she would sit hour after hour by the. side of&#xD;
the lakes, and amuse herseTh casting in little pebbles, and&#xD;
watching the circles, which were so small at first, widen&#xD;
and widen, untjl they reached the bank. how closely&#xD;
those little wavelets resemble human lives, which become&#xD;
more and more extended, until checked at last by the nar-&#xD;
row bed in whh~h all must repose. Maud became deeply&#xD;
attached to their ~iinple home in the mountains, and it was&#xD;
only after much persuasion that her husband prevailed&#xD;
upon her to appoint a day for her return to the city. lie had&#xD;
been a bird of passage all summer, coming and going, as his&#xD;
business required, and the fact of being alone so much, with&#xD;
absolutely nothing to occupy her time, had only served to&#xD;
heighten the ideal state in which she lived. Now that&#xD;
the "melancholy days had come," she was basking in the&#xD;
glorious beauties of the season, and disliked especially to&#xD;
abandon them for the contracted, limits of the city. The&#xD;
grand forests had donned their autumnal robes of red and&#xD;
gold and russet brown, and her chief occupation then con-&#xD;
~msted in making wreaths and crosses of the richly tinted&#xD;
and Varied leaves.&#xD;

proach of hoary winter.&#xD;
The mountainn air had worked wonders for Maud, and&#xD;
the out-door exercise had brought the rose to cheeks&#xD;
which before had only been kissed by th&amp;amp; lily. More&#xD;
than a year had passed since her marriage, and with pain&#xD;
is it recorded that that year seemed only a&#xD;
There was soineth lug wanting in her life. What was it?&#xD;
Colonel llartridge became more reticent, and more en-&#xD;
grossed in l)IISiIICS5 every day, while his wife withdrew&#xD;
closer and closer within herself as time advanced. There&#xD;
was no expressed sympathy, no confidences exchanged,&#xD;
and apparently, little congeniality.&#xD;
But neither one sought to remedy the evil, for they&#xD;
failed to appreciate the fact that ~usband~ and wives should&#xD;

What position is there that the world can give, that wilL&#xD;

torture is worse than being bound to the rack, for with&#xD;
one, life would soon be extinct, while the other method js&#xD;
a kind of "load en-fo~ted" torment, that wrings the heart&#xD;

Kate and Daisy had now 1een home for some weeks,&#xD;
and Maivl( was almost liap:'y w'~ ~li such cheerful and conge~&#xD;
nial companions. Acquaintance ripened rapidly into&#xD;
friendship, ~nd their' ages and tastes being similar, their&#xD;
pi~rsuits, naturally enough, became the same. They were&#xD;
both a!nateurs in music, and together, with Maud and&#xD;
(4i'i y, formed a merry as well as a musical quartette; and&#xD;
4~e bou~e of the ilartridges, from being the most quiet&#xD;
~ne in town, became the abode of gayety. Maud revelled&#xD;
iii the excitement of the hour, and was, strange to say,&#xD;
K&#xD;
glad of anything that left' her no time to herself. Cob&#xD;
6nel Hartridge was, if possible, more overwhelmed in&#xD;
business than ever, and unfortunately made his office hi~&#xD;
home. However, he silently acquiesced in what gave&#xD;
Maud and the girls pleasure, or if he did not no one xvas&#xD;
any the wiser, for he kept his own counsels. Kate flyrd&#xD;
was the only child of his' most intimate friends, who had&#xD;
both died suddenly of yellow fever some years previous,&#xD;
leaving her and her fortune in his hands. Daisy Dean&#xD;
was the 'niece of his first wife, and his adopted daughter,&#xD;
having been left motherless at an early age. Was it not&#xD;
strange that those two girls and Maud should, by the~cir4&#xD;
Cuitous path of fortune, have been thus thrown together&#xD;
&#xD;
COUNTRY AND CITY.&#xD;
in the same household? How dearly they all learned to&#xD;
love one another, and how closely their very heartstrings&#xD;
became entwined, will be known hereafter. Rate was&#xD;
the very imp of mischief, committing the most outrageous&#xD;
acts, of which no one thought anything, as they laughingly&#xD;
said, "It's only Kate Byrd."~ She was very pretty, with-&#xD;
out being beautiful, and in her pale blue eyes lurked a&#xD;
spice of merriment which was quite provocative. With&#xD;
soft, light brown hair, she had a complexion which was&#xD;
clear but tale, and was tall and slender, and grace itself. To&#xD;
these beauties of person were added the generosity of as&#xD;
warm and good a heart as ever beat within human breast,&#xD;
and by her witty and sparkling manners she startled,&#xD;
rather than won admiration.&#xD;
T1~ere was but one opinion in regard to IDaisy, and that&#xD;
was that she was beautiful. She was a perfect blonde,&#xD;
with deep blue eyes, golden hair, snowy complexion,&#xD;
dimpled cheeks, ruby lips and pearly teeth. Add to this&#xD;
loveliness the most winning ways, and the problem by,,.&#xD;
which she bewitched all hearts will be readily solved.&#xD;
"The immaculate trio," as Guy called them, were grouped&#xD;
artistically one morning in the sitting-room, discussing a&#xD;
ball that was to be given that night at Miss Ware's.&#xD;
"Yes, we are all goino~" said Kate in response to an&#xD;
inquiry on the subject.&#xD;
"Then I will make some bouquets," said Mana, 82nd&#xD;
stepping into the conservatory, clipped a basket of e~otiics&#xD;
for the purpose. Daisy had thrown herself gracefully ~i&#xD;
upon a lounge, and was loQking through ~the "last Demo~ ~&#xD;

her head like a crown of gold. Kate sat rocking slowly&#xD;
back and forth, reading what she called a note, but what&#xD;
certainly verged on a letter. A smile played in thc&#xD;
corners of her mouth, and her eyes beamed with happi.&#xD;
ness, as she looked up.&#xD;
" Well! what does he say, Kate ~" asked Daisy, with a&#xD;
liberty which was admissible, considering the intimacy&#xD;
which existed between them.&#xD;
"Oh, it's nothing but an invitation from harry to&#xD;
attend the ball to-night," and her face criinsoned with&#xD;
blushes.&#xD;
"And how many pages does it require for so small a&#xD;
request," persisted Daisy, with mock innocence.&#xD;
"As many as you like," was the curt reply; and Kate,&#xD;
evidently teased, left the room to send a reply.&#xD;
Her dress of green and blue plaid displayed her com~&#xD;
plexion and figure to fine advantage, for she never looked&#xD;
better than on that particular morning. Maud wore a&#xD;
breakfast robe of pearl-colored cashmere with facings of&#xD;
crimson silk, and, if possible, it heightened a beauty&#xD;
~hieh required no assistance from art.&#xD;
The canaries warbled sweetly, the delicate rose-colorc~1&#xD;
ceiling shed a warm halo over everything; new books,&#xD;
ipagazines, and papers were tossed in l)retty confusion&#xD;
on the tables; choice pictures and rare statuettes adorned&#xD;
the walls, the air 'was laden with the perfume of orange&#xD;

home that evening, so it was quite eleven when&#xD;
he and his beautiful young wife, together with&#xD;
the b and their escorts arrived at Miss Ware's.&#xD;
The home~'of the Wares was one of those old "Tabby&#xD;
Houses," to be seen now and then in this "ghoul-haunted&#xD;
woodland of Weir," which stand boldly out like some&#xD;
grand antig~t~, and whisper silently of gentle blood and&#xD;
spotless history. Entering the brilliantly illuminated&#xD;
honse to strains of enchanting mu sic, the party in&#xD;
question hurriedly paid their respects to their host and&#xD;
lioste~s, and repaired at once to the dancing saloon. here,&#xD;
their tablets were soon filled, and they abandoned them~&#xD;
selves to the gayety of the hour. As Colonel llartridge&#xD;
did no~ dance, he sought the card-room, and was soon&#xD;
deeply interested in a game of whist. Maud looked&#xD;
superb that evening, for she was dressed most becomingly&#xD;
in a rose-colored moire-antique made em train, with&#xD;
g)c6nier of joint c4ppiiqud, while diamonds glittered upon&#xD;
her neck, arms, and corsage, and a tiny diamond bird;&#xD;
which held a pink moss-bud in its mouth, sparkled in the&#xD;
puffs which arose as a coronet upon her classic head. She&#xD;
was quite a favorite in society; and her beauty elicited&#xD;
bursts of admiration wherever she turned; but her digni&#xD;
lied manner kept every one at a proper distance, and h0&#xD;
would have beemi bold who had dared couch his praise i~&#xD;
any but the most respectful terms.&#xD;

"You are looking perfectly radiant to-night, Kate,"&#xD;
said harry Fielder, as she sank upon an ottoman to rest.&#xD;
just as they finished a spirited gcd op.&#xD;
"Don't I always look so?" asked this imp of mis-&#xD;
Chief. -&#xD;
"Of course you do, my darling," he answered, while ho&#xD;
gazed upon her with a look of intense admiration.&#xD;
"Don't be so affectionate, harry. People might sup-&#xD;
pose we were in love;" and. a becoming pout was visible&#xD;
upon her thin, ruby lips.&#xD;
"I hope they would think correctly?" was the rather&#xD;
doubtful reply, as harry looked searchingly into her&#xD;
saucy blue eyes.&#xD;
"Not a bit of it," laughed this coquette, as she went&#xD;
off with some gentleman, who just then reminded her&#xD;
that the last half of that ~r&amp;amp;dop belonged to him. harry&#xD;
~stood looking after this capricious creature, with a troubled&#xD;
expression upon his manly face, while there was ~ miug~&#xD;
Rug of, love and pain' in his heart.&#xD;
Her dress, which was exceedingly becoming, was a&#xD;
happy combination of the simple and beautiful, consisting&#xD;
as it did of white tarlatan, elaborately puffed, the puffs&#xD;
being divided by blue satin piping. The panier and&#xD;
corsage were trimmed correspondingly, while sprays of&#xD;
silver #heat, caught by silver bees, sparkled in her browr.&#xD;
hair, and silver jewelry, and a blue Roman sash, completed&#xD;
this exquisite toilette.&#xD;
While Kate was trying her charms upon her new&#xD;
partner in a retired corner of the saloon, Fred West was&#xD;
saying, "What. a lovely 'Undine' you would make to~&#xD;
night, IDaisy!"&#xD;
"My dress is appropriate; do you like it, Fred?"&#xD;

"I think I never saw a more exquisite toilette," and he&#xD;
gazed at her with his whole soul beaming in his eyes.&#xD;
The conversation was inieri'upted by a Mr. llunter,~wlio&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"I was just in search of you, Miss Dean-I believe this&#xD;
is our waltz," and leading her off, ti~iey were soon whir1~&#xD;
lug in that delicious dance, to the music of the "ililda&#xD;
ViTaltzes."&#xD;
As she floated around the room, her light and airy&#xD;
dress attracted niuich attention. It was composed of tarlm.&#xD;
* tan, in the new shade of IMletternich, made with myriads&#xD;
of narrow frills, while the overskirt and corsage were ('f&#xD;
crystal tarlatan, producing the effect of dew-drops on green&#xD;
gossamer. ITer golden hair was cr4pecl and fl~wiug,&#xD;
while a little crystal bird peeped out hereand there, hold.&#xD;
ing sprays of sea-weed and grasses in their months. She&#xD;
wore no jewelry, for her good sense told her that youth&#xD;
and beauty required no embellishment.&#xD;
The two hours before supper flew by on rosy wings,&#xD;
and Maud could scarcely realize it was past one, when the&#xD;
Colonel came to escort her to the table. Tie was unnsu~&#xD;
ally silent, and fancying a cloud rested upon his brow,&#xD;
Maud said:&#xD;
"lYhat is the' matter?"&#xD;
"Nothing," he answered and smiled, as they made slow&#xD;
progress in following the crowd into the banquet-hall.&#xD;
"Put I fear you are not well," she insisted.&#xD;
"I assure you. I am pt~rfectly well, but a press of bust&#xD;

"Then we will go home as soon as supper is over~."&#xD;

of others. By this time they had reached the supper&#xD;
room, and the conversation was broken, not to be renewed.&#xD;
Sitting in the embrasure of a window, looking around,&#xD;
she thought her eyes had never listed upon a more&#xD;
brilliant assemblage. The women were incomparable,&#xD;
the men gallant and distingu~, the nmsic entrancing, and&#xD;
the feast all that the most fastidious epicure could have&#xD;
asked. Wit and repartee flashed around the board, and&#xD;
many were the toasts that were pledged in the exhila-&#xD;
ratii)g 1~oderer; but neither the dainty dishes, nor choice&#xD;
yiands, tempted Maud, and her manner was abstracted,&#xD;
as she gave only random answers to the questions of two&#xD;
or three gentlemen who were standing around her. Tired&#xD;
of the crush incident to a crowded supper-room, she was&#xD;
only too glad to join the ladies, who were then leaving&#xD;
the gentlemen to their xvine and cigars. having been&#xD;
denied the pleasure of a conversation with Miss Ware,&#xD;
eaily in the evening, she sought that opportunity but to be&#xD;
disappointed, for the young hostess was engaged else-&#xD;
where. Left to her own resources, she entered the&#xD;

turning the leaves of some sheet music.&#xD;
Seating herself at the instrument, her fingers glided&#xD;
almost unperceptibly into that most touching of all airs,&#xD;
"Ah, che, lc&amp;amp; morte."&#xD;
The arrangement was her own, and so intensely did&#xD;
she enter into the spirit of the composition that, for the&#xD;
time being, all other thoughts were ignored. Suddenly&#xD;
&#xD;
she became aware of the presence of some one, and look~.&#xD;
ing rip, encountered the burning gaze of a stranger. ITo&#xD;
had glided noiselessly to the piano, and was regarding&#xD;
her with an intensity which must have proceeded from&#xD;
an appreciation of her music. In blushing confusion she&#xD;
arose hastily, and was just leaving the instrument, when&#xD;
Miss Ware joined her and said, "Mi's. Ilartridge, allow&#xD;
me to present Mr. D'Estaing; I am sure you will be the&#xD;
I)C5t of friends, since one is such a brilliant performer,&#xD;
and the other, such a connoisseur in music."&#xD;
"Oh, Miss Ware, I must enter a protest against such&#xD;
flattery," IMland smiled and said.&#xD;
"As T must al~so, but with thanks to Miss Ware for her&#xD;
kindness."&#xD;
his voice~ was low and musical, and his accent slightly&#xD;
foreign. As their hostess then bowed and left them, the&#xD;
stranger said,&#xD;
"I trust you will pardon me, madam, for the liberty I&#xD;
took in listening to your music."&#xD;
"Oh, certainly. I am only too glad, if. you found it&#xD;
worthy your attention."&#xD;
"It has been an age since I have heard any one play&#xD;
with so much soul and expression; "Ak, eke, Ia morte"&#xD;
is my favorite air, although the emotions it awakens&#xD;
might be justly called painful yleasures."&#xD;
Without noticing his allusion, Maud said,&#xD;
"I think Verdi's name should be enrolled among the&#xD;
saints for that air alone. But do you not play, Mr.&#xD;
D'Estaing?"&#xD;
"Not now," he said, with a sigh.&#xD;
"You have?"&#xD;
~ other days."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Then I hope to be enabled to recall those other days~&#xD;
and&#xD;
"You know not what you hope," was the quick reb&#xD;
spouse, and f ' a moment a cloud rested upon his brow,&#xD;
T~ecovering himself almost instantly, he said,&#xD;
"I fear my lyre is forever silenced, but my apprecia~&#xD;
tion is as keen as evet, at least, for such music as yours."&#xD;
"Au, Maud, I was in search of you," said Colonel&#xD;
Ilartridge, joining her. "If you are ready, we xviii go."&#xD;
"Mr. D'Estaing, Colonel llartridge," said Maud, pre~&#xD;
sentin g the two gentlemen. As they grasped each other's&#xD;
hands, in genuine Southern style, the Colonel said,&#xD;
"I am happy to meet you."&#xD;
"I am equally delighted, and more especially as I am&#xD;
the bearer of some messages to you from your friend,&#xD;
IMI~reau.&#xD;
"Indeed? Where did you know him?" asked the&#xD;
Colonel with pleasure.&#xD;
"In the East."&#xD;
"I should as soon have expected news from the dead,&#xD;
for he never writes now," said the Colonel with regret.&#xD;
"Theii you have been a wanderer, too ~"&#xD;
~ answered D'Estain~ with a sigh.&#xD;
~~&#xD;
"Well, I declare, this is an unexpected pleasure. how&#xD;
did you leave him, and did he. say nothing of coming&#xD;
hoi'ne&#xD;
"lie was well when we parted, and said nothing of re~&#xD;
turning. When I spoke of making the South my home,&#xD;
a thought of living in Florida, and he was anxious to give&#xD;
i~ie letters of introduction to yourself and other friends&#xD;
in this city. My movements being then very uncertain&#xD;
&#xD;
I declined them, assuring him, however, that 11 would see&#xD;
you, if fate cast me in your midst."&#xD;
"I am glad to welcome you to our city, and shall do&#xD;
myself the honor of calling. Where shall I find you?"&#xD;
"At the office of the Savannah Tim1es, where I shall&#xD;
be most happy to see you, sir."&#xD;
The conversation was here interrupted byiMaud, who&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"As it is gro~Ting late, Colonel, we had better go."&#xD;
Shaking hands warmly with the stranger, the Colonel&#xD;
made an appointment to call on the morrow, and as&#xD;
Maud bowed gracefully to him, he left the room.&#xD;
hastily paying their adieux to their ho~t and hostess, with&#xD;
flattering compliments to their eleg5t entertainment,&#xD;
they were soon at "home, sweet home."&#xD;
Being too tired to talk, they soon slept, and in their&#xD;
light shiinbers, bright visions, bewildering fancies, a~d&#xD;
half-remembered strains of sweetest music held high ear~&#xD;
nival, and completed the night so happily beo'un.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
ALPUONSE D'ESTAING.&#xD;
~ UT there is nothing that makes its way more&#xD;
directly to the soul than beauty, which immedi-&#xD;
~ ately diffuses a secret satisfaction ~and comply;&#xD;

anything that is great or uncommon. The very first dis&#xD;

90.               ALPuONSE D'ESTAING.                                                 ALPHONSE D'ESTAING.                91&#xD;
&#xD;
~o'very 'of it trikess the mind with an inward joy, and&#xD;
spreads a cliee~'fulness and delighe through all its facul'&#xD;
t~ies." Thus wrote Mr. Addison, and the verdict of maw&#xD;
kind will 1)0, that lie wrote truly, for where i~ h~imtw&#xD;
beii~g with eyes so blind and soul so dead, who has not&#xD;
al some time, felt tke potent charm of beauty? I3oth mdi&#xD;
and wonien. are vanquished by its powers, and if their lips&#xD;
refuse to speak its praise, their hearts acknowledge, in&#xD;
sec:~et, that "a thing of beauty is a joy forever."&#xD;
Alphonse D'Estaing would have boon considered a&#xD;
noble specimen of his race, in any age and among any&#xD;
people, and it is but just to add that he had been the&#xD;
object of much silent admiration wherever his roving&#xD;
footsteps had led him. Among his friends lie was often&#xD;
spoken of as that "perfect specimen of nfaiily beauty,"&#xD;
and here, amid strangers, his "unfortunate appearance,"&#xD;
as he considered it, made him conspicuous where he had&#xD;
hoped to remain unnoticed. His whole air was so striking&#xD;
that if an author had been in want of a hero, D'Estaing&#xD;
would have been chosen at once as the man to fill the&#xD;
place. lie had the sad, dreamy eyes, the melancholy cast&#xD;
of features, tl~e ~manly proportions,~ and the mysterious&#xD;
something, which writers fancy, and which fascinate the&#xD;
reader. Beauty is a dangerous gift to both men and&#xD;
women, and if IYEstaing had not abused his personal&#xD;
charms in order to gain unenviable triumphs, it might have&#xD;
been attributed to the fact that his life was absorbed by&#xD;
some fatal remembrance, and not that he was freer from&#xD;
tern ptation than othei's.&#xD;
The morning after the ball, he sat in his "sanctum,"&#xD;
buried in reflection. Lightly, but surely, fell the foot of&#xD;
time, and the world went on the same, but ho was evi~&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
gently oblivious, if not indifferent, to both. His hat was&#xD;
drawn over his eyes, wreaths of cigar smoke encircled his&#xD;
head, and leaning back in a chair, his feet rested upoii a&#xD;
table of papers, books, and magazines which sat near. A&#xD;
review of those books, etc., as well as an editorial, were to&#xD;
be forthcoming by a stated hour, but up to the present&#xD;
moment his d aties had claimed no part of his attention.&#xD;
lie was conscious of only one thing, and that was a dis-&#xD;
tracting memory of the music he had heard the evening&#xD;
before. The touch was so like nEns-his beautiful, inno-&#xD;
cent dead. Yes, there was sornetjiing about her that re~&#xD;
called poor Marie. It was not a resemblance-no-it was&#xD;
a certain tone of voice, a softness of maimer-a pair of&#xD;
dreamy brown eyes, full of pleading tenderness. No, they&#xD;
had no features ali ~ce, and yet-and yet, there was some-&#xD;
thing similar, ~nd that something was very bewildering.&#xD;
lie vainly thought the " dead past had buried its dead,"&#xD;
and did not dream it possible that a strain of music could&#xD;
so vividly recall the images of the "loved and lost."&#xD;
Then, to' his horror, the "Misei'cre" sounded painfully&#xD;
in his ears, like a funeral dirge that was being chanted by&#xD;
mocking demons, his murdered playmates passed before&#xD;
him, and in another moment their voices seemed to join.&#xD;
in their O~vu requiem. The tones were the same in&#xD;
which Gustave sang during those last happy (1~yS ~n&#xD;
Paris as "Manrico," with Marie as "Leonora," and the&#xD;
friends who happened to be present rendering the chorus.&#xD;
'Was lie holding communion with the (lead, or had the.&#xD;
dead conic back from the grave to mock him? Was it&#xD;
reality~was it fancy? Was lie waking-was he sleep-&#xD;
ing? Who knows, as I~aphiaeI von Ezra says, in "Ilypa-&#xD;
tia," but what dreams are realities, and sleeping waking?&#xD;

92              ALPHONSE D~ESTAINO.&#xD;
Thu~ hour after hour, D'Estaing sat brooding over that&#xD;
pa~t 'whieh he firmly believed nothing but resurrection&#xD;
b&#xD;
day could disentomb, until memory was maddened-brain&#xD;
was frenzied-heart was on lire, and life became almost&#xD;
msnpp~ tablel.&#xD;
Whence this strange man came, or what were his ante-&#xD;
cedents ~no one knew, but his courtliness of manner evi-&#xD;
dently stamped him as one born in the purple. his ac~&#xD;
quaintanee with Mr. Ware, which had been secured&#xD;
through the publicatIon of some able articles on "IRepub-&#xD;
licanism in Europe," ~as fortunate, for it had been the&#xD;
means of introchwiTlg him to a small literary coteriewliere&#xD;
he was duly appreciated. It was difficult to gain an&#xD;
enfrie into this circle, and Mr. Ware rather hesitated&#xD;
about presenting him; but the fact of his being an entire&#xD;
stranger was soon forgotten in an increased and apprecia-&#xD;
tive popularity. This was perhaps owing as much to his&#xD;
modesty and want of assumption, as to his polished manners&#xD;
and cultivation. Preferring to be left alone, he sought no&#xD;
one, but when an advance was made to liimit was met&#xD;
wjth consideration and politeness. lie was nol a cynic,&#xD;
for he was not embittered; nor yqt a misanthrope, for he&#xD;
hftd found it impossible to live without the society of&#xD;
friends.&#xD;
His melancholy was of that s~ubdned kind, which shows&#xD;
that the heart has been softened by whatever sorrow it&#xD;
may have known. And his air, although tinged with&#xD;
kauteur, waS proverbially amiable. his eyes and hair&#xD;
w~ere jet black; his brow high and intellectual, his nose&#xD;
~lightly l~oman, while a very dark complexion bespoke&#xD;
the foreign blood which flowed in his veins. His mus~&#xD;
tache and imperial, which had been the envy of princes,&#xD;
&#xD;
ALPHONSE D~ESTA1NG.            93&#xD;
did not conceal the peerless lips and faultless teeth&#xD;
beneath, 1)uit rather revealed them in greater beauty.' lie&#xD;
had attained the perfection of height, and his proportion~&#xD;
were in accordance. lie looked and walked like a king~&#xD;
and although iris young life seemed bowed down by some&#xD;
"weight of woe," when looking into his penetrating eyes,&#xD;
one felt sure that there was nothing concealed which&#xD;
would tarnish his honor if revealed.&#xD;
This ~)rOlOflgOd reveri~ was terminated abruptly by a&#xD;
rap at the door, and as 1~ir. D'Estaing awakened slowly&#xD;
from his day-dreams, he~ sprang to his feet, and said,&#xD;
"Come in," before lie actually knew what had aroused&#xD;
him, or to whom he spoke. Ills visitor stood in 'the door-&#xD;
way, but was evidently undecided whieth~r to enter or not.&#xD;
"Your pardon, Colonel lIartridge," D'Es.taing ~ow&#xD;
said, and, advancing quickly, grasped him by the hand.&#xD;
"Iwas indulging a fanciful mood, and was so lost in&#xD;
thought that I did not know who asked admittance. I&#xD;
am delighted, to see you."&#xD;
"Thanks, but you see I am not very punctual, as I&#xD;
was to be here at eleven, and it is now one."&#xD;
"One o'clock!" exclaimed D'Estaing in surprise. "It&#xD;
cannot be possible. here have I been sitting dreaming&#xD;
the whole morning, with all my duties neglected. I fear&#xD;
I shall make but a poor editor."&#xD;
"It must be a very hum-drum kind of life, that is, I&#xD;
mean to say that the same daily routine must become&#xD;
very tedious."&#xD;
"On the contrary, I find it really fascinating. But&#xD;
then I suppose any employment would seem better than&#xD;
none to a man who has been for years a wanderer, with&#xD;
nothing particularly to do."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8258-00000047"/>&#xD;
114             ALPHONSE D'ESTAING.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, I presume so. I hope I find you well aftei&#xD;
th~ dissipation of last evening?"&#xD;
L~Not so, I regret t#y. I am so unaccustomed to late&#xD;
hours and parties, t4at I arose fronri a troubled sleep this&#xD;
morning with such ~ severe headache, that it has totally&#xD;
unfitted me for my duties. I was just trying a cigar,&#xD;
which is my panacea for every ill. Do let me offer you&#xD;
one.&#xD;
"Thanks. I, too, find them, as Buiwer says, 'a solace in&#xD;
every sorrow, an amendment to every joy, a panacea for&#xD;
every woe."'&#xD;
"Parties are such a bore to me that I am half-vexed&#xD;
with myself for attending this one. However, Mr. Ware&#xD;
has been so kind to me since my arrival here, that I could&#xD;
not well decline hi~ invitation."&#xD;
"Then you knew tile 'Wares before?"&#xD;
"Never! My pen was my first and only introduction tQ&#xD;
Mr. Ware."&#xD;
"For my own sake, I am very glad you attended .the&#xD;
party, or I mio'ht never have known you.&#xD;
Colonel Ilartridge was not a demonstrative i~ian, as has&#xD;
alrea(ly been shown but he felt iustiuctiv~ly drawn&#xD;
toward the young stranger, and, singularly enough for&#xD;
him, yielded to the blind intuition., It was rather a re-&#xD;
markable coincidence that D'Estaing should entertain the&#xD;
same feeling for his kind visitor, for if they had any sen~&#xD;
timents in unison they were as yet undeveloped.&#xD;
* "You are very kind, I am sure, and I must thank you.&#xD;
In speaking of this ~)arty, I only intended to refer to my&#xD;
d~sl~ke for general society. I infinitely prefer a social&#xD;
hour with a friend to all the balls and parties."&#xD;
* "We agree exactly ofl this point, but, as my wife is fond&#xD;
&#xD;
AL~HON8E D'ESTAING&#xD;
of such gayeties, I try to cultivate a taste for them foe&#xD;
her sake. But you have told me nothing of my old&#xD;
friend Morean."&#xD;
Well, there is little to tell, for although we were.&#xD;
travelling companions for nearly two years we exchanged&#xD;
110 coiifid~iic~s.&#xD;
"Is it possible?"&#xD;
"At one time we wandered on the classic shores of&#xD;
Greece too~ether, at another time we traversed the burn-&#xD;
ing deserts of Arabia, and on one occasion stood side by&#xD;
side upon the Pyramids; but at all seasons, and in all&#xD;
places, he wore the same haggard, wretched look. It&#xD;
seemed as if life was over for hhn, but he never breathed&#xD;
a word to me, nor I to him."&#xD;
"Poor fellow! to think he has allowed the faithlessnesrs&#xD;
of a frivolous woman to blast his xvliole. life-simpleton&#xD;
that he is."&#xD;
"But his nature is so intense, that he feels deeply and&#xD;
for a long time."&#xD;
"Perh4s so, and as time cures all things, my only hope&#xD;
110W 15 that his poundss may be healed in years to come."&#xD;
"But time does not cure all thimigs; would to God it&#xD;
did," caine from tile lips of D'Estaii~g~ with so much&#xD;
earnestness as to make his visitor suspect that he, too, had&#xD;
apa8t.&#xD;
"lIe has written me that he is frequently without a&#xD;
dollar, and that he is sleeping upon the ground, while his&#xD;
fortune is lying-idly here, and he goes into such inaceessi-&#xD;
ble places that no money can reach him."&#xD;
"lIe has become fascinated with the !dfc," said WEs-&#xD;
taiiio'&#xD;
"Indeed, we both liked it, and used often to laugh at&#xD;

our poverty. What brought me back to civilization, 1&#xD;
know not, for I was better contented in the wild Arabdife&#xD;
we led than I have been since my arrival here."&#xD;
C~J am sorry to hear you say so, and I hope when you&#xD;
have ~ere longer, and know us better, that you will&#xD;
change your opinion."&#xD;
The conversation then drifted into a variety of sub-&#xD;
jects, all of which were ably discussed by the stranger,&#xD;
and when Colonel llartridge consulted his watch, he&#xD;
found, to his amazement, that two hours had glided rapidly&#xD;
by. Arising to go, he said, "I really must beg pardon,&#xD;
Mr. D'Estaing, for trespassing so long upon your time."&#xD;
"And I must thank you for a most opportune and&#xD;
agreeable visit."&#xD;
"If I thought your aversion to society did not extend&#xD;
to a quiet family dhiner, I should request the honor of&#xD;
your company this evening.~~&#xD;
"I am deeply grateful for your kindness, but it will&#xD;
be impossible to-day, as I am in arrears with all my&#xD;
duties. At some future time I shall be most happy to&#xD;
accept the kind invitation with which y6u. have honored&#xD;
"To-morrow, then ~"&#xD;
"Yes, to-morrow, for I am eager to heai~ some of your&#xD;
wife's delicious music again."&#xD;
"She says I do not appreciate it," at the same time&#xD;
smiling proudly at this compliment to his beautiful young&#xD;
wife.&#xD;
The two then shook hands warmly, and as they parted,&#xD;
To-morrow, at six.&#xD;

THE DINNER-PARTY.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV".&#xD;
THE DINNER-PARTY.&#xD;
"We may live without poetry, music and art;&#xD;
We may live without conscience, and live without heart;&#xD;
We may live without friends; we may live without books;&#xD;
But civilized man cannot live without cooks.&#xD;
He may live without  , ~what is knowledge but grieving?,&#xD;
He may live without hope,-w~iat is hope but deceiving?&#xD;
He may live without love,~w~at is passion but pining?&#xD;
But where is the man that can live without dining?"&#xD;
hAT man cannot live without cooks and dining,&#xD;
may, in the words of Owen Meredith, be very&#xD;
true, but it is neither the one nor the other that&#xD;
makes "the hour of dinners the most blessed upon earth;&#xD;
it is "the feast of reason, the flow of soul," the society of&#xD;
congenial spirits, th~ brilliance of conversation, which&#xD;
flavors the wine, renders the patA famous, and consecrates&#xD;
the odor of certain flowers.&#xD;
It was neither the viands, nor the delicacies, which&#xD;
have handed down, through two centuries, those famous&#xD;
dinners, which used to be given in a certain alley in&#xD;
Paris, but it was the wit of Scarron,'and the brilliance of&#xD;
Madame de Maintenon, which have preserved the memory&#xD;
of them.&#xD;
When Marc Antony partook of the most extravagant&#xD;
feast of which the world has any account, it would have&#xD;
lacked the proper flavor, unless the pearl had been dis~&#xD;
solved by the "glorious Sorceress of the Kile2' and while&#xD;
it is admitted that cooks and~dinners, in themselves, may&#xD;
be necessary to sustain life, it isno less true7 that company. K&#xD;

Tfl]~ DINKEi-PA1~TY.                                                       TJJ]iJ DIR-PA~?jy*                    ~99&#xD;
&#xD;
ionship and circumstances are the requisites which make&#xD;
~ "the hour of dinners the most blessed upon earth."&#xD;
~ut it xvas of neither ancient nor modern, simple nor&#xD;
extravagant banquets, that D'Estaiug thought, as he said&#xD;
to himself,&#xD;
"Ought I to go to this dinner to-day? I have promised,&#xD;
but I can be released. Is it exactly honorable for me to&#xD;
accept the hospitality of any one, under the false charac-&#xD;
ter in wliidi fate compels mc to appear?"&#xD;
But the music of that evening at the ball tempted him,&#xD;
with its lingering echoes; as the day advanced no excuse&#xD;
was sent, and at a little pa3t six he handed Mrs. hart-&#xD;
ridge in to dinner. There were many elements which&#xD;
should have made it a "blessed hour," but notwithstand-&#xD;
ing the combination, there seemed to rest upon one and&#xD;
all a constraint which would not be dispelled, and to&#xD;
Maud the meal was interminable. The table was ~pre~id&#xD;
d Ia Russe, and after expressing his admiration at the&#xD;
profusion of exotics, which so vividly recalled his child-&#xD;
hood~s days, the stranger, to the right of the hostess,&#xD;
lapsed again into a silence, which was only broken by the&#xD;
deinarwls of courtesy. Colonel Ilartridge ventured a few&#xD;
remarks, with the hopes of inducing a general con ver-&#xD;
sation, but they fell stilLborn, and the dead silence which&#xD;
followed each effort only heightened the quiet embarrass-&#xD;
ment which they all felt. Maud looked beseechingly at&#xD;
Guy, who was always so ready and witty; but he was&#xD;
never easy in the presence of his rival, harry Fielder, and&#xD;
her plead ing glances failed to produce the desired effect.&#xD;
Kate seemed under a ban, and Daisy and Fred. talked in&#xD;
a low whisper, which rather resembled the tone of fear&#xD;
than of. ~p1aisanteri~. ~ot even the champagne, with it~&#xD;
&#xD;
* exhilarating effects, had the power to elevate their spirits,&#xD;
arid as soon as the cc~f6 noir was served, Maud and the&#xD;
girls eagerly availed themselves of the privilege of retir..&#xD;
lug, and leaving the gentlemen to their cigars. When&#xD;
in the pai'lor, Kate said, in her usual impressive st&#xD;
"Ileavens! If Luerezia I3orgia had&#xD;
presided at that&#xD;
dirinei, and forced us to drink her fatal poison, it could&#xD;
not have been more funereal. What's the matter with all&#xD;
of us?"&#xD;
"What's the matter with you?" asked Maui&#xD;
"I don't know, I'm sure! I feel as if ~bout to be exe~&#xD;
cuted, and you both look the same. We must be indebted&#xD;
to the 'mysterious stranger' for such horrid feelings.&#xD;
Who knows, anyhow, but that lie may have Borgia blood&#xD;
in his veins?"&#xD;
"Oh, IKate," said Daisy, as a feeling of terror ran&#xD;
through her.&#xD;
Ataud said nothing, but seating herself at the piano,&#xD;
wandered off into some dreamy air, which reached the&#xD;
diiiiiig-roorn, and soon brought the "mysterious stranger"&#xD;
to her side. Pausing to acknowledge his presence, he&#xD;
said, "Do you know that your music has haunted me ever&#xD;
since the evening of the ball ?"&#xD;
"Indeed? that i~ quite a compliment," and~; her face&#xD;
~~as wreathed with smiles.&#xD;
"It is true, and I have tried in vain to exerejse the&#xD;
memory of it."&#xD;
"To ejeorci8e it?" burst in surprise from her lips.&#xD;
" Then it gave you pain rather than pleasure?"&#xD;
"Yes. It was.~ painful pleasure."&#xD;
A deep sigh followed the words, an expression of&#xD;
suffering came over his face, and Maud regarded him i~&#xD;

THE DINI~U&amp;amp;B-PARTY.           101&#xD;

THE PIN~ERPARTY.&#xD;
&#xD;
wondering silence. The merry peals of laugT~r which&#xD;
came from the opposite room at this moment sounded&#xD;
like mockery, but perhaps were fortunate, as they served&#xD;
to arouse D'Estain~ from a melancholy mood which was&#xD;
neither suited to the time nor place. Suddenly rccollect~&#xD;
ing that he was in the presence of a stranger, he said,&#xD;
"Do give me some music."&#xD;
There was no reply, but, as if acting under a spell,&#xD;
Maud selected a piece which happened to be lying on the&#xD;
piano, and holding it up, said,&#xD;
"Shall I ~ this?"&#xD;
"XVhat is it?"&#xD;
"Prudent's Miserere."&#xD;
"No--for heaven's sake, no "-came from his lips with&#xD;
such earnestness and "wild regret," as made her shudder.&#xD;
Quickly dropping the piece, as if there had been pollu~&#xD;
tion in the touch, she looked again at the singular being&#xD;
before her, but said nothing. After a few moments he&#xD;
hurried to say,&#xD;
"I beg pardon, madam, bat there are such bitter mem~&#xD;
ones associated with that air, that Ii never wish to hear it&#xD;
again.&#xD;
There is nothing more embarrassing than a half-conff&#xD;
deuce, and a painful pause ensued.&#xD;
Thinking to dispel the momentary gloom which had&#xD;
seized her guest, and extended to herself, she left the&#xD;
piano, and calling to Kate, said,&#xD;
"Come and sing one of your bright songs for Mr.&#xD;
D'Est~ing. My music is all too sad for liin-i."&#xD;
Without awaiting to be pressed, Kate did as requested,&#xD;
and rendered that reckless song, called "The mirth of&#xD;
despair.~~ It was written by an English officer, ~ho was&#xD;
&#xD;
stationed in India, and is said to have been sung by the&#xD;
soldiers, during the terrible ravages of some epidemic&#xD;
there, which swept them away by hundreds, when every*&#xD;
man felt that lie might be the next victim. G~iy joined&#xD;
in ihe chorus, and as they saiig verse after verse, IMlaud&#xD;
became nervous, and Mr. D'Estaing was horrified to het&#xD;
a woman's lips sing,&#xD;
"Here's to the dead already,&#xD;
Efnrrah for the one who dies next."&#xD;
At its conclusion a feeling of relief burst from every&#xD;
heart in the room, and Kate retired, writhing under a si..&#xD;
lent condemnation, which was felt as keenly as if it had&#xD;
been expressed. From that night a mutual dislike sprang&#xD;
up between herself and Mr. D'Esta~iig which amounted to&#xD;
indifference on his part, and hatred on hers, and time but&#xD;
increased these sentiments. As Kate and Guy repaired&#xD;
to the libi.ary, Maud said,&#xD;
"Come now, Daisy, and sing my favorite for Mr. D'Fs.&#xD;
tain&amp;amp;'&#xD;
"With pleasure, if Mr. D'Estaing wishes to hear it,"&#xD;
she smiled and said.&#xD;
The gentleman referred to evinced his desire by es~&#xD;
cortiug her to thQ piano, and she sang, in her mpst be~&#xD;
witching manner, "'Tis but a little faded flower."&#xD;
his pleasure was expressed in his face, and when' she&#xD;
had finished the only two verses it contains, ho begged&#xD;
that she would sing it again. But as they were calling&#xD;
her to complete a game of cards in the library, she ex-&#xD;
cused herself by promising an early repetition, and re~&#xD;
tired. Maud was watching the stranger with increasing&#xD;
interest, and she wondered if he "kept dead flowers," 01&#xD;

"a ring," or "a tress of golden hair." When they were&#xD;
alone once more, he said, with great emphasis,\&#xD;
"Will you not give me some music?"&#xD;
With a mi~cliievous smile she said, "Have you not been&#xD;
listening to music?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes," he replied, with a shrug of the shoulders,&#xD;
which plainly signified " Oh no."&#xD;
"But with due respect to the ladies, I do not fancy&#xD;
th~t style."&#xD;
"Well, what shall I play ? '~ asked Maud with some&#xD;
hesitation at making a selection.&#xD;
"Anything you choose. I have no prejudice against&#xD;
any other air, except your first selection."&#xD;
Without replying she placed Ilerz's "Andante" upon&#xD;
the board, and played it with all that dreamy pathos and&#xD;
depth of feeling which it must ever arouse in the soul of&#xD;
the appreciative. With bowed head, D'Estaing drank in&#xD;
every note, and when the last echo had died away, he&#xD;
looked up only for a moment, to say,&#xD;
"Play on-play on."&#xD;
His appreciation inspired INland, and a number of clas-&#xD;
sical selections followed each other in rapid succession,&#xD;
until she was forced to cease from physical exhaustion.&#xD;
The last chord had been played, but the sound of it still&#xD;
floated on the air; and the listener sat with bowed head,&#xD;
as the performer arose from the instrument.&#xD;
Looking up just then, iD'Estaing said, "I cannot find&#xD;
words, madam, to express to you the exquisite pleasure&#xD;
your music has afforded me."&#xD;
"I congratulate myself upon having had such an ap&#xD;
preciative listener."&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
* "My only reo'ret is that it is over so soon."&#xD;
.1  ~&#xD;
"P~~t it is not so soon," said Maud, for she was really&#xD;
suffering with fatigue.&#xD;
"Tine-and I must beg pardon for trespassing so long&#xD;
upon your time."&#xD;
"1 am never happier than when playing for some one&#xD;
who loves music as I do."&#xD;
"You are more than kind, and I must return my&#xD;
thanks for a charming evening. I promised to join your&#xD;
husband very soon, when we parted at the table, and I&#xD;
fear he will think inc a sad delinquent."&#xD;
"Oh, no; he ~vill only consider his wife's charms&#xD;
greater than his," said Maud mischievously.&#xD;
"And he will consider very rightly," added D'Estaing&#xD;
with fervor.&#xD;
"Come, we xviii look him up," said Maud, and leading&#xD;
the way, ID'Estaing folloxved her, and they entered the&#xD;
sitting-room together, to find the Colonel dozing over a&#xD;
cheerful fire.&#xD;
Maud then said "good-night," and not feeling in the&#xD;
humor to join the gay circle in the library, sought her&#xD;
own chamber, and wheeling~ an arm-chair before the&#xD;
grate, sat gazing into the glowing embers, and thinking of&#xD;
their strange visitor, until her eyelids drooped and she&#xD;
fell asleep. She slumbered lightly, and in her dreams&#xD;
came visions of a dark and handsome stranger, a rich,&#xD;
mellow voice fell softly upon her ear, a pair of poetic&#xD;
eyes gazed into hers, and the air was filled with seraphic&#xD;
strains. D'Estaing remained hut a moment with his host,&#xD;
for he was in no mood for talking, and he desired chiefly&#xD;
to be alone. But in the solitude of his chamber he waa&#xD;

"Beware! Beware!&#xD;
Trust her not,&#xD;
She is fooling thee."&#xD;
OR heaven's sake, Kate, do be serious for once&#xD;
in your life, and tell me if you really love&#xD;
* These words were spoken with deep&#xD;
feeling by Harry Fielder, several days after the dinner-&#xD;
party, during which time his patience and devotion had&#xD;
been sorely tried. * Kate thought she would have a little&#xD;
fun, and a mischievous smile parted her lips, as she said,&#xD;
"Well, really, Harry, I don't know whether II do or&#xD;
not."&#xD;
"Who does, then?" was the quick retort.&#xD;
"1 regret II cannot inform you," came provokingly&#xD;
from a pretty roscbud mouth.&#xD;
"Perhaps Mr~ Witherell could give me the desired in--&#xD;
formation, as he seems to be your confidential friend at&#xD;
present."&#xD;
"Perhaps he could," was archly said by the fair tor--&#xD;
mentor.&#xD;
"Kate, this coquetting has gone far enough. You&#xD;
know how I worship you, and yet you can find it in your&#xD;
heart to tantalize me in this cruel manner. You say you&#xD;
&#xD;
do n~t know whether you love me or not, and that per.&#xD;
haps another person can give me the desired information,&#xD;
and that-"&#xD;
"Why, Harry, I do believe you are jealous," and a&#xD;
pretty picture she made, sitting there picking a camellia&#xD;
to pieces, which he had just given her.&#xD;
"No, I am not jealous, Kate; and yet I would not foi"&#xD;
the world think I owned a heart which was not wholly&#xD;
nnne"&#xD;
"What nonsense you talk, Harry," was the taunting&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"I swear, Kate, you are enough to provoke a saint from&#xD;
heaven."&#xD;
"But you must not swear at all, Harry, and especially&#xD;
in the presence of a lady.~~&#xD;
harry was provoked beyond description, and all his&#xD;
efforts at concealment were vain; but his wounded tone of&#xD;
voice failed to soften the heart of the capricious creature&#xD;
so fondly loved, as he said, a second time,&#xD;
"Do ~you love me, Kate, and do you intend to be mar-&#xD;
ried to me?"&#xD;
"The first question has been discussed sufficiently, and&#xD;
the second one will be answered at the altar, when the&#xD;
priest asks, 'Wilt thou take this man to be thy wedded&#xD;
husband?'"&#xD;
"But who is to be the happy man?" eagerly asked&#xD;
ITarry.&#xD;
"I haven't the slightest idea," she laughed.&#xD;
"Oh, Kate, why will you keep me in such cruel sus~&#xD;
pense."&#xD;
"Well, indeed I don't know, Harry;" and her merry1&#xD;
childlike laughter grated harshly on her lover's heart.&#xD;

"Take care, Kate, for remember there is suclu~thing&#xD;
~s going too far, and patience may be exhausted."&#xD;
These words were spoken more iii sorrow than in an-&#xD;
ger, but misconstruing them purposely, Kate said haugh-&#xD;
tily,&#xD;
"Oh, you threaten, do you?"&#xD;
"No, my darling, but you cannot understand how&#xD;
deeply I feel your treatment, nor how much pain you&#xD;
dive me, because you do not love as I do."&#xD;
"If you read hearts so well, why have you asked the&#xD;
same question so frequently?"&#xD;
" Oh, Kate, II do not read hearts,-wou1~d to Heaven I&#xD;
did, for then I might discover ~what I fear I shall never&#xD;
learn from your lips."&#xD;
"And what is that?"&#xD;
"Why ask, when you know so well? It is whether you&#xD;
~in~erely and truly love me or not?"&#xD;
having toyed with her victim until she was tired ,this&#xD;
imp of contradiction and waywardness threw up her&#xD;
handkerchief, arid cried,&#xD;
"A truce-a truce,"-and Harry's        face and&#xD;
beaming eyes expressed his unuttered thanks. Not know-&#xD;
in g what to say, or what to expect, he awaited tile pleas-&#xD;

most bewitching and coquettish manner," Do you forgive&#xD;
me, Harry?"&#xD;
"Freely and fully, my darling,"-&#xD;
"Will you listen to what I have to say?".&#xD;
"With all my heart."&#xD;
"Well, Ilarry, you know I am nothing but. a madcap&#xD;
ti'iily, and that I scarcely know my own mind two minutes&#xD;
at a time. Suppose I were to say now that I love y~u&#xD;
&#xD;
better than all the world beside, engage myself to you to&#xD;
be married on a certain day, and the next week or month&#xD;
brought some one whom I should like better, what then ?"&#xD;
"1 have never contemplated it in that light, K ate," and&#xD;
cloud rested upon the face that was so hri~lit a moment&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"Well, then, it is high time you had done so, for it is&#xD;
altogether possible and probable that that xviii be the&#xD;
very xvay I shall do."&#xD;
harry made no reply, but a deep sigh expressed what&#xD;
he felt.&#xD;
"Come, don't be so downhearted, Harry, for at pres-&#xD;
ent II like you better than any one else ;-does that fact&#xD;
give you any pleasure?"&#xD;
"Indeed it does," was the happy rejoinder of one who&#xD;
lived between clouds and sunshine.&#xD;
"And if I promise that at the expiration of a year I&#xD;
will consummate matters, provided my feelings undergo&#xD;
110 change, will that satisfy you?"&#xD;
~&#xD;
'~ Not so fast, my young man-I said provided. In the&#xD;

Snatching it away, she sprang from her seat and said,&#xD;
Ii declare, harry, I'm 'tired to death, for II never kept&#xD;

"You do indeed remind me of the promised land-just&#xD;

iRushing to accept the banter, he was doomed to fresh&#xD;
disappointment, for making her escape, she laughed mer~&#xD;
rily, and running up stair~, threw him kisses from the tips&#xD;
of her pretty lingers.&#xD;
So, harry, poor fellow, had to leave without a kiss, or&#xD;
even a pressure of the hand; and notwithstanding this&#xD;
hoyden provoked and teased him to such an extent, he&#xD;
was more madly infatuated, with her than ever.&#xD;

UNLIGHT and twilight and music, "I' the.&#xD;

True, it had been a mingling of. roses and thorns&#xD;
-of bitter and sweet-of pleasure and' pain, and yet the&#xD;
memory of it was cherished fondly. Maud played with&#xD;
more fecliug than usual one evening, and the inspiration&#xD;
which produced such a happy effect was doubtless to be&#xD;
traced to an appreciative listener who sat near.&#xD;
D'Dstaiug had now become almost a daily visitor at&#xD;
the hlartridges's, as well as a constant companion in their&#xD;
drives and walks, and at the theatre and opera he inva~&#xD;
riably lingered a moment in their box, if he did not attend&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Their friendship~\as everything to this stranger and&#xD;
wandered~, and they enjoyed equally his ai~tfait criticisms&#xD;
upon art, music, poetry. and the drama. Th~y had visited to~&#xD;
gather every point of interest around the poetic and dreamy&#xD;
city, and the beauty of each spot had always been enhance&#xD;
by his discriminating taste and artistic eye. On the even~&#xD;
ing referred to, either some strain in the music, or a&#xD;
similar thrill of the soul, recalled an hour of long ago,&#xD;
and, as if impelled by an unseen power, D'Estaing said,&#xD;
"Without drawing invidious comparisons, you reilly must&#xD;
go to Italy, the land of song, to hear the old masters ren.&#xD;

"I' Tilt GOLDI3~{ CLThX~!"&#xD;
&#xD;
7 sunsets was gilding tower and steeple, spire and dome, and&#xD;
'shedding its last dying tints of red and gold over high&#xD;
and low, II entered the beautiful city of Florenco.&#xD;
Several days' tramp in the Apennines, which had been&#xD;
undertaken with the hope of dispelling painful memories,&#xD;
had quite exhausted me; but finding no peace anywhere,&#xD;
I roai~cd on, little caring whither. After wandering for&#xD;
somo time, ~o particular place in view, I at last&#xD;
rested upon the ,ponte di &amp;amp;tntct Trni~ita, the, most rioted&#xD;
of the bridges that covers the Arno, as it flows gracefully&#xD;
\ through that lovely city. There, I tried to amuse myself&#xD;
by examining the statuary with which the bridge is&#xD;
adorned, and by watching the gay promenaders who&#xD;
assemble there in the evening. The pure Italian of those&#xD;
Tuscans caine trippingly and musically from pretty lips,&#xD;
and, fool that I was, I wondered how they could be so&#xD;
merry when I was so wretched.. There were many&#xD;
Americans and English people among the happy throng,&#xD;
but, as I shunned mankind in, those days, they were un-&#xD;
known to me, and I was indeed, 'a stranger in a strange&#xD;
land.' Growing weary of this scene, I passed on, whither&#xD;
I knew not, and cared less. At length, unintentionally, I&#xD;
found myself at the entrance of the 'Church of Santa&#xD;
Croce,' which is, as you know, the 'Westminster Abbey'&#xD;
of Florence. j had been there before OW a visit to the&#xD;
tqml)5 of Michael Angelo, Machiavelli, Galileo, Alfieri,&#xD;
and' the other illustrious dead who sleep there, but had&#xD;
never d~amed of attending service, for I thought myself&#xD;
too wicl~ed even to enter. the house of God. however,&#xD;
being just then in a fit mood to be swayed by the slightest&#xD;
appeal to my overwrought and overtaxed senses, I yielded&#xD;
to t~ie inclination which prompted me to follow the s~uud&#xD;
&#xD;
of the organ, and entered the h~ly sanctuary. Locvv&#xD;
ceilings. which were covered with frescoes by the old&#xD;
masters; tall, Gothic windows of exquisitely sMined glass;&#xD;
myriads of tinted sunbeams quivering upon the kneeling&#xD;
multitude, and the music of seraphs burst upon me in&#xD;
such beauty and grandeur as words cannot portray. As&#xD;
I drank all this iii at one draught, although not a profes&#xD;
sor of any religion, I involuntarily sank upon my kn~~s, and&#xD;
with bowed head, remained immovable, even when The&#xD;
con o'reo'ation arose. The service was soniewhat advanced&#xD;
for it ~vas the hour of vespers, and all at once the most&#xD;
~,n~ehic voice I have ever heard fluttered pleadingly&#xD;
forth, then growing stronger and richer each moment, the&#xD;
whole building seemed to tremble with melody.&#xD;
"Times without number, I had prayed to die from&#xD;
wretchedness, but on that evening I thought it would be&#xD;
so sweet to 'pass away, while the senses were steeped in&#xD;
such excess of rapture. '0 Salutaris ilostia 'had never&#xD;
been sung before, and 'Tantum Ergo' sounded as if the&#xD;
heavens had parted, that I might hear the eternal praises *&#xD;
of the angelic host, as they reverberate day and night&#xD;
around the throne of Jehovah. Finally the service was&#xD;
concluded, the priests had gone, and, with the exception.&#xD;
of a few devout ones, who told their beads in silence., the&#xD;
congregation had all disappeared. The sunset had deep-&#xD;
ened into twilight, and still the unseen organist played&#xD;
'such divine music as was never heard before nor sifice,&#xD;
and still I knelt, alQne and in the gloaming. ~ddenly&#xD;
an insane desire seized me to behold the being who could&#xD;
thus hold 'no riveted, as if by some potent speii. Rush~&#xD;
lug, like a madman, to the loft, I there saw, by a dim&#xD;
light, the most beautiful, and at the same time the ino~U&#xD;

*   revolting sight that my eyes ever looked upon. A hor~&#xD;
rid deformity, neither man nor beast, but a combination&#xD;
of 1)0th, was before me. -To say that he was hunch-backed,&#xD;
dwarfed, old, wrinkled, with skin like a Moor, and eyes&#xD;
like a hyena, set in the head ~f a man, club-footed and&#xD;
with hands like claws, would be but poorly describing the&#xD;
man-benst who presided at the organ, and gave forth such&#xD;
seraphim~ strains. Near a table, which was piled 'with&#xD;
books and sheets of music, sat a young girl, who, horrible&#xD;
to related, I afterward learned was the daughter of this&#xD;
deformed genius, and the same person who sand so db&#xD;
finely. She was pale, wan and weary, but lovely beyond&#xD;
description, in her sisterhood's dresg, as, leaning her head&#xD;
upon her hand, she gazed dreamily into vacancy. In-&#xD;
stantly regretting my rashness, I lingered but a moment,&#xD;
then turning hastiI~ away, left as noiselessly as I had en-&#xD;
tered. The memory of the evening haunted me so that .1&#xD;
could not sleep that night, and it was days before I could&#xD;
dispel it ~rorn my mind. The remembrance of it lingers&#xD;
with me in all its freshness, and will, no doubt, to my&#xD;
dying day. But you ~re weary, and I must say 'good.&#xD;
niohit.' "&#xD;
"Good-night," she said, and, with a pressure of hands,&#xD;
he was gone. Maud was deeply affected~ by this thrilling&#xD;
little story, and as she sat thinking, she seemed to see the&#xD;
deformed organist and the pale young girl, while the&#xD;
music of seraphs filled the air. Was she dreaming, or&#xD;
did an invisible host chant to her lonely and hungry&#xD;
soul?&#xD;

such a priceless treasure as your love."&#xD;
"And why ?"&#xD;
"I do not know, unless I agree with the poet, who&#xD;
says: 'The brightest still the fleetest,' and acknowledge&#xD;
a secret dread that my treasure may be snatched away&#xD;
from me."&#xD;
"Poets are allowed much license, you know, and simply&#xD;
because their words jingle and are pleasant to the ear,&#xD;
they attempt to make their philosophy correspond."&#xD;
~VWTeIl , y little darling'~ and so let it be in our&#xD;
said in&#xD;
case, the rhyme to correspond to the philosophy of others,&#xD;
while we set the world an enduring example of love and&#xD;
constancy."&#xD;
"With all 'my heart! But, then, they say also, 'There&#xD;
is nothing constant but change.' Is that the constancy&#xD;
you would have?" asked this little sprite archly.&#xD;
"Why, what a meddler in philosophy you have grown,"&#xD;
said Fred, his sparkling eyes bespeaking his idolatrous&#xD;
admiration. "No, indeed! I would know nothing of con~&#xD;
stant chang~ except that which is needful to supply your&#xD;
wants, and surround you with elegance and comfort. But&#xD;
surely you must have been reading Carlyle, or Haven, or&#xD;
Bacon."&#xD;
"No; I have 'no use of any philosophy or creed to'&#xD;
teach me how to do a tlm~ng my heart fashions itself to&#xD;
involuntarilyY&#xD;
"And what is that your heart fashions itself to invol-&#xD;
untarily !"he asked ~agerly.&#xD;
"Why, Fred! what but love of your own 4ear self I"&#xD;
and the merry blue eyes gazed lovingly into another pair&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC8258-00000058"/>&#xD;
of blue eyes which reflected back ardently the love-lit&#xD;
glances which from them shone.&#xD;
"Say it ~ail, darling. IL could die to such sweet&#xD;
music as falls from your lips;" and he kissed away the -&#xD;
little half-sighed rippling laugh that gushed forth, like&#xD;
the timid twitter of a young song-bird.&#xD;
"Oh, Fred I "exclaimed the pretty mouth, while a gen-&#xD;
tle resistance was offered to his caresses; "you are mak-&#xD;
ing such a baby of me;" then turning her face to her&#xD;
liver again, suffused with a vivid blush even to the vein.&#xD;
netted temples, "What could I do bat love you?"&#xD;
Another kiss upon the tempting lips expressed his&#xD;
thanks, though with something like a sigh, he said,&#xD;
"~aisy, could I but foresee that our future would be as&#xD;
bright and cloudless as at this moment, what would 1'&#xD;
'iiot give? But it will not-cannot be!" he coiftinued&#xD;
sadly.&#xD;
"Oh, Fred, why do you talk 80'?" was her anxious in-&#xD;
quiry.&#xD;
~(Becau5e~nothing!" was the abstracted reply. "Only&#xD;
it i~ more of a blessing than we dare hope for."&#xD;
"No, Fi'ed. Be honest That is not altogether t~he&#xD;
reason of your sadness. Tell me, or I shall be iniser~&#xD;
able."&#xD;
As if forced to utter words from which lie would have&#xD;
refrained, Fred looked into the dim and shadowy dis-&#xD;
tauice, and said,&#xD;
"Let me try as I ~ay to banish such thoughts, when-&#xD;
ever I look forward ~o the future there is a dark cloud&#xD;
that looms up before me, and envelops our' whole hod-&#xD;
zon in midnight blackness; while you and I, my pet,&#xD;
&#xD;
stand within its shadow, and are covered in a 'pall of&#xD;
glooin.~~&#xD;
"Dear Fred!" tremblingly escaped her lips, as she&#xD;
nestled more closely by his side, and a moment afterward&#xD;
was sobbing, while her golden head related on his honest&#xD;
breast.&#xD;
"Pardon! a thousand pardons, sweet Daisy !" and&#xD;
lifting up her face, he kissed the great tears from her&#xD;
silken:fi inged eyelids.&#xD;
She smiled, and a child-like laugh followed. "I am&#xD;
foolish and nervous, Fred."&#xD;
lie smiled as well, with another and another kiss.&#xD;
"Thus let me ever bring sunshine after the shower, Daisy.&#xD;
We are both rather cliildi~h, I am inclined to think. But&#xD;
let us away with gloomy forebodings. Perhaps, after all,&#xD;
it is only an envious, cruel phantom, which comes to mock&#xD;
our happiness."&#xD;
"You are not well, Fred," said Daisy, noting his hot,&#xD;
feverish hand; "and it is said such fancies often spring''&#xD;
from an over-taxed brain. Promise me you will not con~&#xD;
fine yourself ~o closely to your studies."&#xD;
IDo I i~ot study for your sake, darling? And am I&#xD;
not endeavoring to become more worthy of my priceless&#xD;
pearl ?"&#xD;
"But I do not think any improvement necessary;"&#xD;
said the trusting girl.&#xD;
"'low doubly sweet is this' flattery from your lips,"&#xD;
said Fred; "but indeed I must' go now, oi Blackstoiie&#xD;
will feel sadly neglected for this day at least. If you only&#xD;
knew how hard it is for me to go, you would be cross, and&#xD;
send me with frowns away. Instead of that you smile,&#xD;

"I~ather do 1 find language powerless, Daisy, when I&#xD;

the clasp of his strong arm around her waist, she retreated,&#xD;

cheeks, and she sank again upon the cushion to dream of&#xD;
a happy future.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIIL&#xD;
"OM4Y WAITING!"&#xD;
. AITING for what ?-for whom? For an event&#xD;
or for a person? If for the former, what was it?&#xD;
If for the latter, who was it?&#xD;
i~eadei', have you never felt a vague unrest, which&#xD;
could n~t l)e accounted for by any, prophetic demonstra-&#xD;
tio~ uf the past-an undefined something, you knew not&#xD;
* what.--afata morfctnct, 'an ignisfatt&amp;amp;u~, which lured you&#xD;
on arid on, and then left you to grope alone in midnight&#xD;

darkness or mystery inexplicable? An invisible power&#xD;
impelling you forward, you knew not whither, until y~n&#xD;
were lost in mist and clouds, while myriads of fch hut&#xD;
unseen sprites mocked and jeered at your cieduli~y?&#xD;
If you have never, known this,-if you have never felt&#xD;
the aching void of the unrest, or the mysterious snr~&#xD;
i'oundhig of these invisible but powerful impelling&#xD;
agencies,-if busy demons have never tempted or goaded&#xD;
you to peel' iiito the inscrutable, or to attempt to span the&#xD;
breadth of infinitude, it is well, and the blissfulness of&#xD;
ignorance reaches heights of sublimity.&#xD;
"Only waiting!"&#xD;
Her air was listless, her manner abstracted; she wan~&#xD;
dered around the house-out of, yet in the body-in a&#xD;
maze. Sometimes in her dreams she was borne into&#xD;
illimitable space, but to fall from dizzy heights, or sink&#xD;
into fathomless depths of strange speculation. At other&#xD;
times she felt as if floating on. the immeasurable expanse&#xD;
of waters, like "leaves along the limpid streams of Eden,"&#xD;
soon to be rudely tossed back upon "Mother 32artl~"&#xD;
The hoped-for haven seemed often to be almost reached,&#xD;
-so near that the prow of her lY~at well nigh touched&#xD;
the glittering strand; but it was all mockery-only an&#xD;
illusion; for a fathomless whirlpool seethed and tossed&#xD;
just before her, and sense and feeling bade her take in her&#xD;
sail and reverse the action of her oars: she therefore ~at&#xD;
"waiting-only waithig!"&#xD;
Ye who have had your footsteps tracked by this invis-&#xD;
ible and shapeless something, must know full well how it~&#xD;
Wrings the heart with anguish, how it causes "Cimm~&#xD;
nan dai'l~i~es~" to reign~at high noon, how the feet must ~&#xD;
travel the pathway alone; for this grim, unsoci~b1e ~&#xD;

120             ~ONLY WAITING!"'&#xD;
&#xD;
rience admits no human coinpanionship, and scoffs at&#xD;
human sympathy-even the possibility of it. It is the&#xD;
inevitable foe~ with whom so many are condemned to&#xD;
wage warfare, unaided, as they sit "waiting only,,&#xD;
waiting." Grieve not, but "8uft'~e~, and be 8t~ong.".&#xD;
,Maud'~ gay companions were not ignorant of, nor blind&#xD;
to, the changes that had come over her; but in response&#xD;
to the kindly inquiriess' as to what was the matter, she in-&#xD;
variably replied, "Nothing!"&#xD;
"Nothinol" A world of meaning 'may be conveyed&#xD;
in that "on~ word." What yearnings unsat.isfled,&#xD;
what tears withheld,--what heart-aches endured,-what&#xD;
misery inconceivable,-what hopes blighted,-what love&#xD;
~nutold! All these, and how incomprehensibly much&#xD;
more may be understood in that trite little dissyllable.&#xD;
But Colonel ll~rtridge was mercifully blind to all this&#xD;
tumult that raged in the heart of his wife, and which&#xD;
was wearing her life away, like the continual dripping&#xD;
that melts the' stone. Why? Simply because he was too&#xD;
much with his business , and too little with his wife.&#xD;
True, every temporal want was diligently looked after&#xD;
and supplied; and what right has. a wife to expect more?&#xD;
So she is fed and. clothed and housed, and the comforts&#xD;
which speak to 'the oal;side world are not neglected, it&#xD;
matters not how or in what manner-according t6 the&#xD;
received rules of social ethics-duty is done, and carping&#xD;
tongacs silenced. The world does not consider it cruel&#xD;
for the husband to be cold, silent, abst~'acted, unsocial,&#xD;
J inattentive, undemonstrative; but it is. thought' worse&#xD;
n crimiuai for a wife's heart to yearn fo~' that love and&#xD;
sympathyy which every trusting,, loving womaii needs,&#xD;
though it may be denied her from the proper source.&#xD;
&#xD;
But who can control the heart; and what Herculean&#xD;
power is there with streno'th sufficient to still human&#xD;
yearnings?&#xD;
Men may preach and men may practise,-they may&#xD;
trammel the impulses of the heart, and place in th hands&#xD;
of conscience the spear and the rod,-bnt just ~a '~iirely&#xD;
will coldness and neglect send a woman's in&#xD;
search of th~ympathy and warmth, the affectio~g and&#xD;
J tender~~with6ut which it freezes and dies, as the Hower,&#xD;
confined~to cold and darkness, will lift its sickly branches&#xD;
to the one ray of sunlight which pierces its prison cell.&#xD;
iMlaud Ilartridge had all the outward appliances of&#xD;
comfort, but she yeai'ned for kindly words, delicate atten~&#xD;
tions, the numberless little evidences of a thoughtful&#xD;
husband's care and love. But they came not, and a deep&#xD;
melancholy pervaded her life, as she was "waiting-o&#xD;
waiting."&#xD;
It was a dismal, dreary evening, and the wind sighed as&#xD;
mournfully around the eaves of the house, as if freighted&#xD;
with thq~piteous wails of the lost. Maud sat before a fire&#xD;
of glowing edals, gazing into the blue blazes, as if trying&#xD;
to read in them what the future might hold in store for&#xD;
her. There was a theatrical celebrity in the city, whom&#xD;
the girls had gone to see; and, as usual, Colonel Hart-&#xD;
ridge had business at the office which detained him, and&#xD;
the young wife was alone.&#xD;
A ring at the door-bell startled her; not that it was a&#xD;
thing unusual, but she had grown nervous of late, ~nd a&#xD;
sudden sound would set her heart to wilder throb~ and&#xD;
her pulses to quicker beats. Supposing it was eithe~' her&#xD;
husband, or some visitor of the young ladies, the r~ierie;&#xD;

room; and, with a smile, she cried out,&#xD;
~" Why, what a sad truant you have been!"&#xD;
"I am sure I have been the only loser," he replied,&#xD;
gratefully pressing the hand extended to him, "and am&#xD;
almost repaid by knowing that I have been considered a&#xD;
'truant,' foi~ that may imply more than I had dared&#xD;
hope."&#xD;
"If you wish it to imply that you have been missed&#xD;
during the ctqe we have not seen you, then your vanity&#xD;
may be gratified. We have missed you dreadfully."&#xD;
"You are very kind; thanks! However, I owe you&#xD;
an apology for my informal en1tr~e; I thought, of course,&#xD;
you were at the theatre, and only stopped in passing to&#xD;
leave a book, when the servant told me at the door you&#xD;
were in the library; and IL assure you the temptation was&#xD;
too strong to resist. Therefore my entrance unanw&#xD;
nouncdd. Can I hope to be. forgiven?"&#xD;
"Without doubt," laughed Maud. "You attach won-&#xD;
derful importance to ceremony, I see."&#xD;
"But Ii fear I frightened you."&#xD;
"Oh, no; I was a little startled, I confess,. at the ring-&#xD;
ing of the bell, but that i~ nothing new. ii find I have&#xD;
become so nervous latterly, that I shrink even from im-&#xD;
aginary things."&#xD;
"You cannot be well 1" and scrutinizing her closely he&#xD;
was strui~k with her excessive pallor. "But here is the&#xD;
book;" and as she hastily tore the wrapping off, he said,&#xD;
"Do you feel musical to-night?"&#xD;
"Not at all; I would much rather talk. Come, draw&#xD;
up close to the fire and we can have a nice, cosy chat."&#xD;
I.&#xD;
beforee he could reply, "How beautiful I" burst from&#xD;
&#xD;
123&#xD;
&#xD;
her lips, as she discovered the book to be an elegantly&#xD;
illustrated copy of Owen Meredith's "Lu~ile." Just&#xD;
then her eye fell upon the fly-leaf, and she saw written&#xD;
thereon, "A Souven~ir, February, 186-." Simple enough,&#xD;
assuredly, and an additional proof of the faultless taste&#xD;
of the~ man who never seemed to overdo anything.&#xD;
After a moment or two, she raised her eyes, eloquent ol&#xD;
thanks for this token of hi~ remembrance. "flow can 1&#xD;
be grateful enough," she said, in a low, deep voice, "for&#xD;
your kindness. I have been very anxious for this book&#xD;
and shall prize it more highly than any thing you could&#xD;
have given me."&#xD;
"A mere trifle," said he. "Your enthusiastic ~dmir~&#xD;
ation for the work makes you value so highly the form&#xD;
in which it comes to you."&#xD;
She made no answer to this remark, for in a forgetful&#xD;
manner, sh~ was eagerly turning the leaves, and enjoying&#xD;
the* fragrance of a few fresh violets which had been&#xD;
thoughtfully strewn between them.&#xD;
D'Estaing watched her, weikpleased; and after study-&#xD;
ing the illustrations, she looked up and said rather impa~&#xD;
tiently,&#xD;
"But you must like 'Lucile?'"&#xD;
"Oh, I like it well enough! The conception is good,&#xD;
the style beautiful and origin&#xD;
"What?" she cried. al, but-.-J'&#xD;
"I do not admire the character of 'Lucile."'&#xD;
"Do not admire the character of 'Lucile!"' was the ~&#xD;
astonished exclamation. "Neither do I admire 'Sir&#xD;
Alfred Yargrave"'&#xD;
"Nor I. I should have said I do not sympathize with&#xD;

which sent her lover back to his betrothed, and left her&#xD;
desolate."&#xD;
"Yes; but prior to that, when Sir Alfred was free to&#xD;
wed her?"&#xD;
"Well, it is useless ,to. argue this subject again," said&#xD;
Maud, rather impatiently, "for each discussion but&#xD;

that the other is wrong~ Though I should have known&#xD;
that it is impossible for one of your sex to understand or&#xD;

"Do you think, then, I would now be the lonely wan~&#xD;

"A woman sent Moreau to the deserts."&#xD;
"Yes; but Moreau and I are different men. Such a&#xD;
giddy butterfly as wrecked his life could never inspire me&#xD;
with a feeling above contempt.?'&#xD;
"You are fortunate to be so impervious to :beauty'8&#xD;
charms."&#xD;
"I admire beauty only when it is linked with virtue.&#xD;
No; the woman whom I shall love must possess a soul a~&#xD;

"Duty compels, or you do not know how happy it&#xD;

was enveloped in a haze that bore a close resemblance to a&#xD;

&#xD;
London fog, and it required unusual faith to believe that&#xD;
"behind the cloud the sun was ~till shining." Such&#xD;
days are dreary enough tQ those who are surrounded by&#xD;
every comfort, for who does not love the merry sunshine?&#xD;
but how doubly dreary to the poverty-stricken who are&#xD;
suffering from cold arid hunger, as they sit lmddled to~&#xD;
gather in some damp cellar, shivering over a handful of&#xD;
coals.&#xD;
The waIIs~of that dismal room (not home) are covered&#xD;
with a noxious mould, and the rain beats in piteously at&#xD;
the broken panes; while in her luxurious boudoir'~" my&#xD;

daf brings. Search well your heart; probe carefully&#xD;
your conscience; ask whether you have done your whole&#xD;
duty to your fellow-creatures: to the starving, who are so&#xD;
ffliserable; to the weak, who are so helpless; to the timid,&#xD;
who are full of fears; to the bereft, who are so desolate;&#xD;
F     and then return to your girded and mirrored boudoir, and&#xD;
fret over the rainy day, which robs your delicate lace robe&#xD;

crispness. IRernember too, while puerile repinings distort&#xD;
your classic features, that when the night shall close in&#xD;
upon this day, it will be a day dead forever! The howl-&#xD;
ings of the wind, and the shrieks of the tempest are but&#xD;
indifferent precursors of gladness and sunshine to the&#xD;
physical universe; and fretfulness and selfishness are&#xD;
scarcely prophetic of happiness and contentment on the&#xD;

On on6 of these dark, dreary days, the ladies of a cer~&#xD;

fireTendered the apartment too warm for comfort, and&#xD;
contrasted strangely with the cold and rain without. The&#xD;
rose-tinted walk painted the cheeks of the inmates with a&#xD;
becoming color, and the canary birds in the conservatory&#xD;
trilled merrily; the flowers filled the air with delicate&#xD;
odors, while altogether 'the scene was one of tropical&#xD;
beauty and exquisite softness.&#xD;
iMilaud was absorbed in " Corneth up as a flower," that&#xD;
dashing, daring, original conceptiOn of a sixteen-year old&#xD;

grammatical or social conventionalism; and which is full&#xD;
of the quaintest superlatives, and the ~provokinge8t and&#xD;

most questionable naturalness. Daisy was deep in th~&#xD;
last number of the "London Court Journal ;" deep in&#xD;
wonder as to how Lady this, and Lady that, looked in vel-&#xD;
vet and gossamer, train, and laces, and jewels, at the last&#xD;
drawing-room of her Majesty; while Kate paced the&#xD;
floor with impatience, at being con dned in doors."&#xD;
A constraint, which almost amounted to indubitable&#xD;
embarrassment, had been perceptible of late in the inter..&#xD;
course of these three friends; but it was never referred&#xD;
to. There were IIQ more midnight conferences, when&#xD;
women grow confidential over d~jdng embers, as men do&#xD;
over their wine. No more experiences were exchanged,&#xD;
and each one seemed either entirely self-reliant, or wholly&#xD;
self-occupied.&#xD;
What was the cause of it? What had happened~?&#xD;
When one is happy it is not necessary to whisper it se~&#xD;
cretly to a few friends, for the whole world knows and&#xD;
feels it. happiness is electrical. It permeates the at..&#xD;
mosphere, and extends its circles, out and out through all&#xD;
the regions of spiritual sympathy, until it writes itself&#xD;
wherever feeling is known, bearing hope on it~ wings, and&#xD;
light to the deepest midnight that ever groomed a human&#xD;
soul.&#xD;
And this was the case with blithe little Daisy. When&#xD;
one s conscience is ill ~at ease, its accusations are usually&#xD;
ended in silence, and the sufferer shrinks from the pry..&#xD;
ing eyes of investigation, rather than from human sym..&#xD;
pathy; even as he would like to shun the eye of the All-&#xD;
Seeing.&#xD;
By slow degrees Maud had arrived at this unpleasant&#xD;
condition. When one is discontented without cause, un~&#xD;
happy without reason, exposure to a friend ih deprecated~.&#xD;

S.sh and festering wounds to the action of the fro~ty air&#xD;
of midwinter; so they endure, rather thati court con-&#xD;
dolence. Poor Kate had learned to feel this; and&#xD;
whether c~r not her troubles were imaginary, she suffered&#xD;
equally. Is it not sad to know that neither of these three&#xD;
young women had ever knowA a mother's care; had&#xD;
ever been taught at a mother's knee; or had ever been&#xD;
schooled in those invaluable lessons of patience and for-&#xD;
bearance, best taught from a mother's lips, by a mother's&#xD;
experience?&#xD;
"When will it ever cease raining, I wonder!" fell&#xD;
jarringly upon the heavy silence that pervaded the room.&#xD;
There was no reply ~ and Kate seemed talking only to&#xD;
hcr~elf, as she stood at the ~ ndow gazing out on the&#xD;
~~ceIy more than dense, impalpable mist.&#xD;
"Foil days it ha~ poured incessantly, and now the sky&#xD;
is almost black, and forebodes a continuation of inclem-&#xD;
ent weather. I think I shall put on my water-proof suit&#xD;
~nd Polish boots, and go out for a talk despite the rain.&#xD;
Will you not join rue, Daisy?"&#xD;
Yes, yes ~ '~ said Daisy abstractedly, without raising&#xD;
her eyes from the subject-matter of the Princess ~oyal's&#xD;
i~ose-colored velvet robe, ostrich tips, and diamonds.&#xD;
"But----i'e&amp;amp;Ily, i(ate, ekcnse me! What did you say?"&#xD;
was the impatient rejoinder. "(.)f course&#xD;
~ young lady ~ufferipg from an acute attack of heart-&#xD;
disease is expected to be affected also with that corre-&#xD;
sponding disease, 'absence-of-mind.' I only wish Guy&#xD;
would come once more, and then I could defy alike the&#xD;
raging storr~ without and th~ dead calm within."&#xD;
"Mr. Wi'therell would certainly feel complimented if&#xD;
&#xD;
he knew how much he was missed and lamented," said&#xD;
Daisy, nonchalantly.&#xD;
Kate's face turned crimson at this supposed taunt, and&#xD;
walking up to Maud, she demanded, rather than asked,&#xD;
"What oii earth did you say to Guy that morning you&#xD;
were closeted in the library with him? It has been three&#xD;
weeks since then. Did you order him from the house?"&#xD;
"&amp;amp;~ertainly not, Kate."&#xD;
"Do you know where he is?"&#xD;
"No!" was the calm, laconic reply.&#xD;
"Can you tell why lie never comes near us any moreV'&#xD;
"I think I can."&#xD;
"Then do tell me! Why have you not told me this&#xD;
before?"&#xD;
Her voice trembled, and she sank upon her knees be.&#xD;
side Maud.&#xD;
"Because, dear, I am not at liberty to tell;" and as&#xD;
she twined her arms tenderly around Kate's neck, and&#xD;
kissed her flushed cheek, the wayward girl burst into&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
With native delicacy Daisy left the room, and, closing&#xD;
the door softly behind her, left INland and Kate alone.&#xD;
The pause was an unbroken one. Maud did not know&#xD;
what to say by way of consolation to her capriciona&#xD;
friend, so she stroked her, brown hair in silence. At&#xD;
length, however, when Kate's sobs had grown fainter and&#xD;
shorter, a furious ring of the door-bell startled t~em~ A.&#xD;
moment afterward a familiar voice in the hail was heard&#xD;
crying out,&#xD;
"Where is everybody?"&#xD;
Instantly the trio recognized Guy's voice, and rush~4&#xD;

IDaisy brought up the rear.&#xD;
Then followed volleys of kisses and embraces, difficult&#xD;
to decide by xvhom accomplished; and bestperhaps, left&#xD;
t~ conjecture. They dragged, rather than led him into&#xD;
the reception-room, saying, as with a sin gle voice,&#xD;
"Where have you been all this time?"&#xD;
"If one at a time will ask me, I shall try to answer&#xD;
their questions."&#xD;
"Tell me first, then!" exclaimed Kate, smiles peeping&#xD;
out of her dimples, and laughter beaming through tears.&#xD;
"Are your nerves sufficiently well tempered to bear a&#xD;
rude shock?"&#xD;
"II am, mercifully, nerveless; so go on&#xD;
"Why, what a female prodigy!"&#xD;
"I cannot bear comment. IL only wish to know where&#xD;
you have been all this time?"&#xD;
"Don't be too inquisitive, Kate; or you may hear&#xD;
of somethingg to my disadvantage. No man is justifiable&#xD;
in the eye of the law in criminating himself; nor is it&#xD;
hardly fair to expect a man to be willing to blast his own&#xD;
reputation."&#xD;
A laugh followed this diplomatic parry, while Maud, in&#xD;
mock concern, said,&#xD;
* "I was just about to hang crape on the door for you.*"&#xD;
"And I was about to put on mourning," said Daisy.&#xD;
fAnd I was thinking of advertising you as 'lost,&#xD;
strayed, or stolen,'" added Kate.&#xD;
"Upon my soul!" cried Guy, "it is a greaf pity I&#xD;
didn't stay-well-drunk!"&#xD;
"Oh, Guy!" burst from the lips of his fair auditors,&#xD;
with a show of consternation painted on their faces.&#xD;

"Ali, that's better!" said iMlaud, laughing. "For I&#xD;

But tins conversation is entirely too one-sided! Tell me&#xD;

"N~thing! absolutely nothing'!" cried Kate.&#xD;
"What! No parties, balls, weddings, operas, theatres,&#xD;

monotony?"&#xD;
"Not even a hand-organ, oVa monkey," said Kate.&#xD;
"This ~vilI never do; we must arouse the natives some-&#xD;

"I have a treat in store for you," said IMlaud, "but&#xD;
hadn't I better reserve it for the nexf rainy day?"&#xD;
"No, no; let us have it now!" came as from one&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"Well, Colonel llartridge proposes that I shall give&#xD;

"And nephew," added Guy.&#xD;
"If you xviii have it so," said Thud kindly. "And ho&#xD;

"Oh, a masquerade, by all means!" exclaimed Kate in&#xD;
delight.&#xD;
"Well, it is to be left to the vote, and I am to infor*n&#xD;
him of the decision at dinner, so that he may order the;&#xD;

"What is your choice,' Daisy?"&#xD;

THE MASQUERADE BALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Suppose we say a fancy-dress ball, without masks,"&#xD;
suggested Maud.&#xD;
"Oh, that would spoil all the fun," cried Kate; "be-&#xD;
sides, I have a fancy for personating a dozen different&#xD;
characP~rs."&#xD;
"Anything to please then," said Maud, with her usual&#xD;
amiability.&#xD;
"And a mask-ball it shall be!" pursued Kate tri-&#xD;
umphantly.&#xD;
Just then a flood of sunlight poured into the room, and,&#xD;
as if to leave nothing undone that would add to the en-&#xD;
joyment of the hour, the quartette retreated to the piano,&#xD;
aud sang the merriest, most san8 8OUC~ songs which be.&#xD;
longed to Maud's musical repertoire.&#xD;
CHAPTER XX~&#xD;
THE MASQUERADE BALL.&#xD;
"On with the dance I let joy be tmconflned;&#xD;
No sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet,&#xD;
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet."&#xD;
BOUT half-past elcvei~ the rooms preGented a&#xD;
brilliance of scene which was dazzling. Nymphs&#xD;
were grouped beneath overhanging boughs,&#xD;
naiads sparkled in coralline caves, and gypsies sat beneath&#xD;
a teiit tellin~ fortunes, or dancing around a swinging pot,&#xD;
for all of these accessories had been sirnilated in the&#xD;
decorations of the house. Myriads of wax tapers threw&#xD;

their ~uft and becoming light upon the guests, who repre-&#xD;
sented almost every clime and race; rare exotics exhaled&#xD;
delicious perfumes, to which were added the odor of&#xD;
burning censors, and enchanting music thrilled the soul&#xD;
with joy. The crowd was so great that Colonel Hart~&#xD;
ridge and IMlaud made their exit unobserved, a~ they ro..&#xD;
tired to don their costumes, now that they thought they&#xD;
were through receiving.&#xD;
A fearful storm raged without, and it seemed as if the&#xD;
carnival of joy within and the carnival of terror without&#xD;
had thrown down the gauntlet to leach other, to see which&#xD;
could be the most reckless. What did it matter to that&#xD;
gay and giddy throng hQw many ships went down that&#xD;
iiiglit? What did they care for the little bare-footed&#xD;
ones who wandered out in the streets, and whose, only&#xD;
shelter was the raving elements? Sorrow and suffering&#xD;
were ignored by these children of fortune, and reckless&#xD;
gayety ruled the hour.&#xD;
Maud had neither the eyes, hair, nor complexion for&#xD;
"Mai'ie Antoin~tte," but had consented to personate the&#xD;
character to please the Colonel, who was arraying himself&#xD;
in all the regal splendor of th~ much beloved and cruelly&#xD;
persecuted Louis.&#xD;
Their costumes had been sent from 1~ew York, at a&#xD;
great expense, and would have done credit to the persons&#xD;
represented during their reign, for they were reaUy~&#xD;
gorgeous. In dressing hurriedly, Maud had failed t~&#xD;
observe a tiny bouquet that lay upon the toilette, until&#xD;
her maid tailed her attention to it, saying one .of the&#xD;
servants had brought it to the door, and left it for het&#xD;
While examining it, a crumpled piece of paper fell from&#xD;
the gerarrium leaves to the floor, and as her maid handed&#xD;

it to her, she opened it, with trembling fingers, and reads&#xD;
* a disguised hand, the following words:&#xD;
"If not inconsistent with the character you represent,&#xD;
wear these flowers."&#xD;
Scarcely giving the note a thought, and fancying it&#xD;
was some trick of the girls or Guy, she suddenly remem~&#xD;
bered that the proud Austrian beauty was the first prim!&#xD;
cess who ever dared to wear natural flowers, and saying,&#xD;
"how very opportune," exchanged the artificial roses in&#xD;
her corsage for this gift of nature, from an unknown&#xD;
hand. Just then her husbaAd entered, and after much&#xD;
mutual admiration, they drew on their masks, made their&#xD;
exit by a private way, and entering the front door, were&#xD;
duly announced, as the other guests~ had been. The&#xD;
reception room was rather empty at that hour, and after&#xD;
a mock attempt to find the host and hostess, they wended&#xD;
their way to the dancing-saloon. Their costumes attracted&#xD;
considerable attention, and all eyes were turned upon&#xD;
them as they entered. Maud~was at once surrounded by&#xD;
a bevy of gay rnaskers, and yielding to their importunities,&#xD;
was soon whirling in the mazy dance; nor did she imagine&#xD;
that the little bouquet had already betrayed her to a&#xD;
pair of eager eyes that* were earnestly watching her&#xD;
fi'oin the conservatory.&#xD;
At length, dizzy from the whirl of the dance, suffocat-&#xD;
ing with the heat of the room, sickened by the odor of&#xD;
the perfumed air, she stepped into the conservatory,&#xD;
hoping to recover herself there unobserved; and Heaven&#xD;
knows there wa~ no treachery in her heart to any human&#xD;
being when she took that fatal step. A momentary&#xD;
faintness came over her, everything swam around, and&#xD;
she fell forward. Quick as thought, a man, with a Roman&#xD;

THE MASQUERADE BALL.&#xD;
toga folded around him, and a hat drawn over his eyes&#xD;
sprang from behind an orange tree, and supported her ii~&#xD;
his arms. Tier mask was instantly thrown up, a fervent&#xD;
kiss was imprinted upon lie~ lips, and a well-known voice&#xD;
murmured softly, "liLy darling."&#xD;
But the impassioned words fell unheeded, for conscious.&#xD;
ness was gone, and did not return until a loving hand&#xD;
was dipped in the fountain, and somiie of the crystal water&#xD;
therefrom was sprinkled upon her face. Upon opening&#xD;
her eyes, what was her horror to find D'Estaing bending&#xD;
anxiously above her, while words of love came trembling~&#xD;
from his lips.&#xD;
Shrinking from his embrace, she sank upon a seat near&#xD;
by, and sighed heavily, as she buried her face in her&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
Leaning over her, D'Estaing said, in a husky voi~e,&#xD;
"You wear my flowers-I have discovered you.-wifl&#xD;
you keep your word and grant my request?"&#xD;
Recalling her foolish words of.'the day before, when she&#xD;
had promised to grant any request to the one who should&#xD;
discover her, she tore the flowers from her bosom, and&#xD;
dashing them indignantly at his feet, said,&#xD;
"The ruse was dishonorable-the words were a jest,"&#xD;
and arising', she would have left his presence, but a feeling&#xD;
of faintness compelled her to sink again upon the ottoman.&#xD;
Kneeling at her feet; he seized her hands, and in an&#xD;
cited voice said,&#xD;
"Why seek to close our eyes, and steel our hearts to&#xD;
the truth? We love-I know it-I feel it; and if it is a&#xD;
crime to love you, how gladly will I pay the penalty.&#xD;
Stay but a moment, and tell me that you do not hate me&#xD;

&#xD;
for my rashness. Say that you will forgive me, and think&#xD;
of me kindly, my darling one."&#xD;
She looked np-they exchanged one burning glance.&#xD;
It was enough! "Eyes looked love to eyes which spake&#xD;
again," and what they saw written therein made their&#xD;
hearts leap with joy. But it was the joy that is linked&#xD;
wil'h despair; and so thought Maud, as she sank at his feet&#xD;
and said, in a tone of agony,&#xD;
"Lectve me-if you love me-1etve me!"&#xD;
Yes, leave her, while there is yet time. Fly from her;&#xD;
put seas and oceans and distant lands between you.&#xD;
But wherefore?&#xD;
The work is done, and distance cannot blot it from the&#xD;
heart. Still clasping her hands, and bending above ~her&#xD;
kneeling figure, he said, in a whisper,&#xD;
"lfIlov9you!"&#xD;
Then pressing his lips to her pale brow, he slowly went&#xD;
his way, and she was left alone.&#xD;
Alone with her own heart, which in that brief period&#xD;
had sent forth, in a torrent, all its pent-up love, and she&#xD;
worshipped where it was crime to worship.&#xD;
This little heart-sc~e had occupied only a fewminutes,&#xD;
but when iMlaud arose, and tried to force back the tears&#xD;
which were bursting from her heart, she felt as if an age&#xD;
had passed over her head since she entered that lovely&#xD;
~spot. There was little time for reflection, however, for&#xD;
her maid soon entered, and said that Colonel Ilartridge&#xD;
desired her presence, so that the guests might unmask&#xD;
and go in to supper. Speedily joining him, at a given&#xD;
signal the masks were withdv~wn, and many were the&#xD;
amusing scenes that then occurred, for all had sustained&#xD;
their characters so admirably that there had been hut few&#xD;

discussed with avidity the delicacies and luxuries which&#xD;
were there spread before them, and nothing seemed want~&#xD;
ing to ~dd to the happiness of the hour. fl6~he' ~er~&#xD;
formed the duties of hostess the remainder of the evening&#xD;
was a mystery to Maud, for her thoughts had fob&#xD;
lowed her heart, and she desired above all things to be&#xD;
alone. A delicious "German" followed supper, which&#xD;
lasted until the sombre, leaden light of a gloomy day&#xD;
warned the guests to depart. At length, adieux were&#xD;
spoken, the "maddest, merriest." night was gone, and the&#xD;
most'brilliant ball of the season was a thing of the past.&#xD;

&#xD;
clutched the iron railing, and her pale blue eyes, though&#xD;
glazed in ileath, still turned toward the dancing saloon,&#xD;
where the bright lights and sounds of music had lured&#xD;
her to her death. Why did she not wander on?&#xD;
Then, tattered and torn as were the rags, which poorly&#xD;
hid her fragile limbs, she might still have lived and not&#xD;
been cold and stark in death, a reproach to those who&#xD;
revelled in luxury, and forgot the poor, who wandered&#xD;
out in the streets.&#xD;
With heart on fire. and brain in a whirl, when she&#xD;
reached her room, IMlaud had thrown herself in exhaustion&#xD;
upon a lounge. She could not sleep, for thought was too&#xD;
busy, heart too full. After a few moments an unusual&#xD;
noise in the house made her spring nervously up to mn~&#xD;
quire the cause. A presentiment of something horrible&#xD;
rushed over her, and following the sound ,jof voices and&#xD;
footsteps, she went hastily below stairs. in the hall she&#xD;
almost ran against her husband, who bor~ in his arms&#xD;
what appeared to be a lifeless child. ~From whence had&#xD;
she come? where had they found her? were questions&#xD;
which IMlaud asked herself, but no word was spoken, for&#xD;
one and all seemed struck dumb with horror, and they fol~&#xD;
lowed mechanically the Colonel and his hapless burden&#xD;
into the late dancing saloon. Laying her tenderly upon&#xD;
a sofa, he felt her pulse, and shaking his head ominously,&#xD;
said,&#xD;
~" I fear all is over with her."&#xD;
No word escaped Maud's lips, but the agony she felt,&#xD;
was written in her fade, as she sank down by the side of&#xD;
the unknown guest that death had ushered into their&#xD;
midst. Scalding tears rained down her face, and fell&#xD;
npon the pale, pinchea cheeks of the little strange~', and&#xD;
&#xD;
she chafed the tiny hands, as if that would warm her back&#xD;
to life again. Kate~and Daisy knelt beside her, and theit&#xD;
half-smothered sobs, mingling with those 9f the ~e~'vants&#xD;
of the household, grated upon the silence that reigned in&#xD;
~ the chamber of death. A more striking picture can&#xD;
scarcely be imagined than was there presented, as the&#xD;
grayish morning light, weirdly blending with the flicker~&#xD;
ing waxen tapers, fell upon the glittering ball-dresses of&#xD;
the three beautiful women, who knelt around the death~&#xD;
couch of the ragged innocent. Alas! tears and sympathy&#xD;
were unavailing then, for they had come too late. Why&#xD;
did they not protect he~ from the exposure, and snatch her&#xD;
from the starvation which laid her dead at their thres~.&#xD;
hold? Remember, children of plenty, that while yesit&#xD;
refining, the grim monster is abroad in the land, and ye&#xD;
might balk his inhuman appetite by even a crust of&#xD;
bread. Quick! to the rescue!!&#xD;
For what grander benevolence can there be, than to&#xD;
"feed th6 hungry, and clothe the naked"? A physician&#xD;
had retYirned with Colonql Hartridge, every restorative&#xD;
had been applied, but in vain, for the little wanderer slept&#xD;
the last sleep. Taken from sorrow to come, she had gone&#xD;
where neither cold nor hunger should be felt any more.-&#xD;
The city had been aroused and shocked by th6 horrid&#xD;
eventhere recorded, and many kind people came to pi~of~&#xD;
fer their assistance. The police were making every effort&#xD;
to trace the little one, to find if there was any frenzied&#xD;
mother, or ~grief-stricken father, who were in search of&#xD;
their lost child. In the meanwhile, Maud and the girls&#xD;
performed, for the first time, the last sad duties for the hap-&#xD;
less innocent, and the room that had only a few hours&#xD;
before been the scene gf mirth and gayety was unexpe*&#xD;

edly changed into a chamber of Death. They clothed&#xD;
her in dainty robes, and surrounded her with calnellias)&#xD;
which rivalled the marble whiteness of her pallid cheeks,&#xD;
and as she laid there; so still and cold, who could have told&#xD;
that gentle blood did not flow in her veins? lit is well&#xD;
for these poverty-stricken ones, that, unlike man, God is&#xD;
no respecter of persons, or the deserving might be cast&#xD;
into "outer darkness" in the next world, as they some~&#xD;
times are in this. Low sobs, which came from strangers'&#xD;
hearts, broke the awful solemnity of the occasion, and si-&#xD;
lent tears trickled down Maud's cheeks as she watched by&#xD;
the couch of the dead. She had taken no rest, .although&#xD;
the girls and her husband had pleaded with her to do so,&#xD;
and it was a positive relief from her own tempest-tossed&#xD;
feelings to assume the woes of others. As a dim-remem-&#xD;
bered air will sometimes come, when least expected, so a&#xD;
s1o v and measured step fell strangely across the stillness.&#xD;
Maud raised her tear-stained face to :flnd D'Estaing gaz-&#xD;
ing at her ii~ an appealing way which spoke volumes.&#xD;
They exchanged but a glance, and yet, in that 'one look,&#xD;
they both read the anguish of each other's hearts. her&#xD;
head sank, aad. when she looked up again th~ bier was&#xD;
strewn with flowers, but he who placed them there was&#xD;
'gone. The day was n~w far spent, and still no clue to&#xD;
the heart-rending tragedy came to clear away the mys-&#xD;
- tery in which it was enslirouded. Suddenly there caine&#xD;
from the depths of the deep silence a woman'S shrieks.&#xD;
They rent the air, and made space hideous, and the female&#xD;
monster, who thus rudely entered the presence of the dead,&#xD;
threw herself in an agony of grief across tlfe breast of h~r&#xD;
little one. The rags which partly covered her person&#xD;
were filthy, her tawny hairj~ung in tangled masses around&#xD;
&#xD;
her neck, while the deep lines which furrowed her bloated&#xD;
fac~ were unmistakable evidences of debauch and de4&#xD;
pravity; and yet this inhuman creature was a mother.&#xD;
lIol~ name, what sacrilecr ! Raising the child up, and&#xD;
folding her in her arm~ as if to force her back to life, be-&#xD;
tween tears and sobs, she pleadingly said,&#xD;
"Come back, IMiamie, and be mother's little pet once&#xD;
more. Mother was drunk - mother was cruel-but&#xD;
mother will not be so any more. Mother will never leave&#xD;
you again, and go to those wicked places. Oh, speak to&#xD;
me once more, my little darling. Open your blue eyes,&#xD;
and smile on mother once more. Dead-dead-no~no&#xD;
-no-not dead." And her shrieks again burst forth, and&#xD;
with them were mingled the pitiful wails of a child's&#xD;
grief, as little Henry Wood said,&#xD;

"Come back, Mamie. I'll be your horsey; you shall&#xD;
vide on my back as much as you please; Buddie lost you&#xD;
last night, it was so dark. Wake up, sister;" and ~3~aking&#xD;
-~ her, he would have awakened her, but she was dad, and&#xD;
could not hear his little voice. Maud drew liin'4 to her,&#xD;
and tried to. make him understand that " Manie" had&#xD;
gone to live with the angels in heaven, and that if he was&#xD;
a good boy, God would take him up there some day, too,&#xD;
and then he should see his little sister again.&#xD;

taken him in his store-room, where, overcome by exposure&#xD;
and hunger, he fell asleep.&#xD;
Attracted by the lights and music which proceeded&#xD;
from the house of the llartridges, Mamie, iw childish do~&#xD;
light, had clung to the iron railing until the icy arms of&#xD;
death were clasped about her. The wretched mother&#xD;
was still in a drunken stupor when the officers had ar-&#xD;
rived at her hut of poverty,, and they were only able to&#xD;
identify the lost child by Henry's description, whom&#xD;
'they found Bitting in the door of his miserable home, cry-&#xD;
ing bitterly for his little sister. At first, they could not&#xD;
inal~e the unhappy mother understand her loss, or of&#xD;
what they sp~ke; but finally, when the truth flashed upon&#xD;
her, and she felt that she had murdered her child, such a&#xD;
paroxysm of grief and reproaches ensued, as was horrible&#xD;
to witness.&#xD;
And yet, taking all things into consideration, she was&#xD;
but the indirect cause, for was she not the victim of pov-&#xD;

steps; whose' form followed her wherever she went, and&#xD;
entering in at her cheerless door, sat by her wireless hearth.&#xD;
Poverty, that. stared at her from the sunken eyes and&#xD;
pinched, cheeks of her little ones, until, in her desperation,&#xD;
she would drown her senses in the fatal cup, and for a&#xD;
time forget everything.&#xD;
Alt through the long, weary watches of that horrible&#xD;
.~ i~ig1~t, and until the little form was borne from the house&#xD;

wretched mother, and Remorse lay upon the tear-stained&#xD;
pillow of Maud. To think that she found the heated,&#xD;
p~rfume4 &amp;amp;ir sickening, and left the luxuries untas ted,&#xD;
&#xD;
while t1~is little wanderer hungered, starved, froze, and&#xD;

CHAPTER XXH.&#xD;
LENTEN DAYS.&#xD;
TME for Reflection, time for Introspection, time&#xD;
for Retrospection, was found in the quiet of the&#xD;
sacred Lenten days, that followed so closely upon&#xD;
the tragedy enacted in the last chapter. The miserere&#xD;
of Him who was crucified was being chanted, and the&#xD;
solemn festivities of the Occasion&#xD;
orated.                       ~~~eing commem.&#xD;
To those who regard the holy season of Lent, it will&#xD;
ever be suggestive of those trying days in the wilderitess,&#xD;
when prayer and fasting were necessary even for the Son&#xD;
of the most High. All men have their dark days, butAo&#xD;
they fast and pray for strength to resist the seductive&#xD;
voice of the tempter? Do they try to help themselves in&#xD;
asking God, to help them, or do they viaiiily fancy that&#xD;
the intercessions of His Son and His great mercy will do&#xD;
the work? The example of the blessed Saviour p&amp;amp;nts to&#xD;
the contrary. The Bible teaches that He both morti~ed&#xD;
the body and humbled the spirit, before even lie was&#xD;
aI)le to triumph over "the the an4 ~he&#xD;

flow much more essential, then, that men, po~r worms&#xD;
of the dust, should follow in his footsteps, before they&#xD;
can ever hope to begin, as it were, the beginning of a new&#xD;
life? Why do they sit refining, and asking, "What&#xD;
have I done to deserve this?"&#xD;
In their selfishness and egotism they forget that it is&#xD;
by God's mercy and not by his justice that they live at&#xD;
all; that by his goodness alone they enjoy the blessings&#xD;
which are showered upon them.&#xD;
Excitement, loss of sleep, and mental anguish, com~&#xD;
bined with that horrid tragedy, had completely, prostrated&#xD;
Maud; and for weeks she wa~ the victim of that peculiar&#xD;
form of nervous depression, which is more to be dreaded,&#xD;
than physical pain. Oh I the struggle of those days!&#xD;
Tier efforts were worthy of success; but without the aid&#xD;
of ddne grace, all attempts at reform are futile.&#xD;
"What are human resolves? Straws upon the wind-&#xD;
the feather on the ocean. Things made to be broken, or&#xD;
erased, like the name on the sand! What are the best&#xD;
laid plans of men ~ Castles in the air!',&#xD;
Thus thought Maud, as in her vain attempts to cast her&#xD;
idol from her heart, she would find it reinstated, with&#xD;
fresh impulses to worship. Like that other Maud-Maud&#xD;
Muller-the rare and exquisite conception of the New&#xD;
England Quaker poet-she wept and thought, "It might&#xD;
have been I"&#xD;
Not now. Heavens! No I She was another's! And&#xD;
she would spring from her couch, like some guilty wretch,&#xD;
aiid ~huddei' when remembering what treachery it was to&#xD;
allow her thoughts to wander over such criminal gronild.&#xD;
Thus day after day of indecision and shattered hopes&#xD;
weiit,~by bringing additional misery with each s~cceediiig&#xD;
&#xD;
hour, for when did transgression ever give anything else&#xD;
in the shape of reward than suffering? ('Be sure your~&#xD;
sins shall find ye out I She did, not pray: she couk~ -&#xD;
not. She knew nothing as yet of casting her weary bur.&#xD;
den at the feet of her Saviour, and imploring his aid in&#xD;
carrying it; and "the long, long weary days," made her&#xD;
sigh and fea~.&#xD;
Do not condemn, but pity her! Remember that she&#xD;
had never known the sweet privilege which others enjoy,&#xD;
of lisping at a mother's knee, "Our Father, who art in&#xD;
heaven."&#xD;
There had never been any religious influence~ exerted&#xD;
over her and she failed to comprehend how a Christian's&#xD;
bark may be tossed by adverse winds, even to a haven of&#xD;
peace-of "that peace which passeth all understanding."&#xD;
Like many who had gone before, she was gropiDg in&#xD;
"the Valley of the Shadow of Death;" and instead ~&amp;amp;f-&#xD;
humbling her rebellious heart, and asking guidance, she&#xD;
foolishly relied upon pledges made to herself to suatain&#xD;
her.&#xD;
But withhold your sentence, ye hollow-hearted inhabit. 2&#xD;

to-day the ghost of cherished hopes and joys long since&#xD;
departed? Are they not, alas? too often buried at tbe&#xD;
altar? But still the immolating priest murmurs the&#xD;
marriage service; the lights upon the shrine burn n~st&#xD;
brightly; and if the victims walk boldly to the sacrifice~&#xD;
with bleeding heart, and bleeding feet, who cares, or&#xD;

148                      DAYS.&#xD;
- 1rn~gth a sense of duty aroused Maud. By a desperate&#xD;
~effort she once more joined the family circle, but she was&#xD;
so pale and depressed as to arouse anxious solicitude in&#xD;
her behalf. In answer to the kindly and frequent inqui.&#xD;
ries relative to her health, she~ would simply say, "It is&#xD;
iiothi no'? I shall feel better by and by."&#xD;
Better "by and by!" Heaven grant she may, poor&#xD;
woman!&#xD;
As soon as her strength permitted, she accompai1ied her&#xD;
young friends in their daily attendance upon div ne ser~&#xD;
vice, and tried to delude herself into the belief that she&#xD;
was becoming a better creature. Yam delusion I ]IMd&#xD;
not God knbw that ~t was a mockery, and that she but&#xD;
performed mechanically what he required should be done&#xD;
in spirit and in truth? How dared she kneel there&#xD;
before her Maker with such deception in her heart?&#xD;
Why did she crouch within herself and sink lower and&#xD;
lower, when the priest read, "Thou shalt not make to&#xD;
7 thyself any graven image"? Why did she feet that these&#xD;
~iple words were directed at her, and that her heart&#xD;
i~~s bared to every eye?&#xD;
It was because, "conscience~ doth make cowards Qf us&#xD;
all"; and she knew that even in that holy temple she&#xD;
was worshipping in secret and in silence at the shrine of&#xD;
that earthly idol which she had made ~mto herself.&#xD;
had she flO fears of an avenging a~d jealous God?&#xD;
ShQ knelt a~ the others did, but could not pray; and&#xD;

THE PrONIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
outA9or amusements had begun, and the many delight.&#xD;
ful localities around the city were thronged with pleas.&#xD;
ure seekers. Picnics and moonlight excursions followed&#xD;
in quick succession, and the whole population; ,from the&#xD;
infant to the gray-haired man and woman, save those&#xD;
whom Poverty had bound upon her immolating, tear-&#xD;
stained, sigh-breathing altar, entered with zest into tlie~e&#xD;
animal festivities.&#xD;
Upon the ~ay in, question, rather,, a select party had&#xD;
gone to the "Isle of Hope," and, judging by indications,&#xD;
their spirits~ x~ere as bright as the cloudless sky above.&#xD;
Light figures flitted here and there, while upon a plat.&#xD;
form erected for the purpose, the dancers enacted "the&#xD;
poetry of motion " to inspiring music. Beneath the grand&#xD;
old oaks, with their graceful drapery of long moss, were&#xD;
groups '~f the gay revellers, indulging in various games.,&#xD;
Pleasure boats with happy occupants were floating lazily&#xD;
upon the waters, and, in all its detail the picture was&#xD;
pleasing beyond description.&#xD;
The party had gone out in the afternoon with the in-&#xD;
tention of returning by moonlight, and as "the charmed&#xD;
sunset lh~gered low adown in the red west," the banquet&#xD;
was spread and pai~taken of, with appetites sharpened by&#xD;
fresh air and exercise. Wit and repartee lent additional&#xD;
Lest to the meal, and as the dying sunbeams kissed the&#xD;
trees and played upon the waters~ the gay party dis&#xD;
perked to other enjoyments. Weary alike of cards, dan-&#xD;
cing and talking, Maud IIartridge cheerfully accepted aii&#xD;
invitation from Captain Beall for a sail. Her husband,&#xD;
having been debarred the pleasure of joining the ex~ur-&#xD;
~iou, had eutrustd her to the care of this gentleman, who&#xD;
~vas an old and iiitimate friend. He was an accomplished&#xD;
&#xD;
scholar, but unfortunately boating had not been in6lnded&#xD;
in his education, and INland was evidently amused t~t the&#xD;
awkwardness with which he used the oars.&#xD;
Amid deafening shouts and gushing rills of laughter,&#xD;
a closely contested boat-race was just beYng concluded,&#xD;
but not participating they only skirted the shore and&#xD;
skimmed the "crisping ripples" which reflected the"&#xD;
moonlit sky above.&#xD;
The undertaking was hazardous, and was rendered&#xD;
doubly so by the excited manner of the Captain; the&#xD;
cause of which can be easily inferred.&#xD;
A desultory conversation was sustained at first, but it&#xD;
soon lapsed into silence as Maud grew thoughtful, and&#xD;
the effects of the wine began to be felt by her escort.&#xD;
Thus, mentally occupied, they failed to appreciate the&#xD;
danger which threatened them, and were only aroused by&#xD;
a heavy shock, as the boat struck violently against~Jree&#xD;
which obstructed their way. It was instantly capsized~&#xD;
and a moment afterwards, they were both struggling in&#xD;
the waters. Neither of them could swim: no help was&#xD;
near-no human being in sight; the pleasure-boats had all&#xD;
returned, and death seemed inevitable. As quick as&#xD;
lightning a man sprang from his hiding-place under the&#xD;
overhanging boughs where he was concealed, and plung~&#xD;
ing into the water, soon gained the scene of the disaster,&#xD;
The moon was shining in full-orbed, undimmed bright&#xD;
ness, and just at that moment Maud came to the surfae~&#xD;
for the second time; but her clothes becoming entangled.&#xD;
in 'the drooping limbs of the tree, she must have perished.&#xD;
but for the timely assistance of this unexpected deliverer.&#xD;
Seizing her, with one arm around her waist, he managed,&#xD;
by the aid of the swaying branches, to draw himself with&#xD;
&#xD;

his burden from the water; and when he reached the&#xD;
shore, to his horror beI~e1d, in the clear moonlight, the pale&#xD;
but beautiful features of the woman he so madly loved.&#xD;
What to do, in thjs extremity~ he knew not. As he&#xD;
chafed her brow and temples and hands, he covered them&#xD;
with kisses, as if they would restore t~ life. He began to&#xD;
think, and thought rapidly. "Must I leave her and try&#xD;
- to rescue her companion, or does it behoove me to remain&#xD;
by her side, and seek lici' resuscitation alone? Of what&#xD;
'more use could he be to her; and another life might be&#xD;
ebbing away? She might be already dead, and that&#xD;
other one might be saved?" And thell he asked himself,&#xD;
whether, in preserving two lives, he might not atone for&#xD;
the past?&#xD;
There was but a momentary struggle. Out in the&#xD;
water a fellow-being was wrestling with death. Laying&#xD;
the body of the won~an, he held so lovingly to his heart,&#xD;
where the sharp 'moonbeai might not glare too fiercely&#xD;
in the half-closed eyes, he tore himself away. and again&#xD;
plunged boldly into the dark waters, striking out for the&#xD;
heavy figure that twice had come up in the sheen of light&#xD;
that silvered their bosom. For awhile his efforts were&#xD;
fruitless. No eddying circle betrayed the fatal locality of&#xD;
the perishing fellow-being. He strained his eyes in vain&#xD;
over the glittering expanse, and his features were dis-&#xD;
* touted from the pain of keen disappointment. He W&amp;amp;s&#xD;
~bout to abandon the search as hopeless, and, raising his&#xD;
voice, cried out in the silent air of the night,. when a fig-&#xD;
ure bounded up like a cork to the surface, a short dis.&#xD;
tanco to the right of him, and revealed the shape of a&#xD;
man. A vigorous swimmer, he soon reached the spot,&#xD;
a~d ~lutchfng the drowning man by the hair, directed his&#xD;

course for the shore. But the current was strong an4 &#xD;
swift, and breasting across it would have been hard&#xD;
work, even when unencumbered; it was doubly difficult&#xD;
with the hindrance to ~ich he was subjected, while the&#xD;
branches of the trees that drooped and laved themselves&#xD;
in the water were 53 interlaced as to form an almost im~&#xD;
penetrable net-work. Tq go farther down the stream&#xD;
would have been running a greater risk, while to go up&#xD;
it with the heavy weight he bore, would have been im-&#xD;
possible. Meanwhile Maud might be dying or quite&#xD;
dead, with only the sky and the moon and the stars look-&#xD;
ing on, and the quiet night-air catching her last sigh.&#xD;
Urged by. this thought he struggled bravely with the&#xD;
waves. Strong as he was, he felt that his strength&#xD;
was failing rapidly, and the fear of becoming exhausted&#xD;
rendered him almost powerless. At length, however,&#xD;
after many and repeated efforts, his struggles were re-&#xD;
warded with success, and reached the shore with his&#xD;
burden.&#xD;
4&#xD;
They were a short distance below where~Maud lay, and&#xD;
D'Estaing begrudged the little service rendered th~&#xD;
almost dead man before him, because it forced an absence&#xD;
from her. holding the unfortunate man up, the water&#xD;
streamed from his ears, nose, and mouth, and for the first&#xD;
time the horrid dread seized him that life might be so&#xD;
nearly extinct as to render resuscitation impossible, and&#xD;
perhaps Maud was also dying or dead. "What must I&#xD;
do?" he cried in agony. He bad no restoratives about /&#xD;
him, nor did he think that another human being was&#xD;
within hearing. "One might as well be buried in a wil $&#xD;
derness," thought he, "or lost in the jungles of i~di~."&#xD;
And &amp;amp;till he reflected hopelessly, and still the unf~t~M~.&#xD;

m~ gave no s~igns of life, lie used such inean~as were&#xD;

laid him gently down and returned to Maud. He had&#xD;
been absent but a few, moments, but they seemed to him&#xD;
an age; and hi~ conscience groaned in accusation foi&#xD;
neglecting her a single moment for any one else.&#xD;
Taking her in his arms he covered her pale face with&#xD;
kisses.&#xD;
"Maud! Maud, deai~est," he cried, "open your eyes and&#xD;
speak to me!"&#xD;
With the quick eye of lo~ve he thought he discovered&#xD;
the faintest pulsation in the temple, and pressing his&#xD;
fingers upon it, a thrill of joy shot through his heart, as&#xD;
his hopes were verified; and he lifted her up in the moon~&#xD;
light and looked down upon her blanched face. "Maud!&#xD;
~iaud 1" he called again in tender but beseeching ac~&#xD;
eents~ He shook her gently. A moment more of sus~&#xD;
pen~~ and w:,ith a faint sigh, as the waking of an infant&#xD;
from sleep, and she opened her eyes full upon ~the face of&#xD;
stingain, bending lovingly and anxiously above.&#xD;
Her damp garments clung about her like cerements,&#xD;
and shivering with cold and trembling with: fear, she&#xD;
looked around in a bewildered manner, and turning to the&#xD;
water, shuddered and fell back.&#xD;
"Maud, darling, why do you shrink from me?"&#xD;
That his words were unheeded. Consciousness had not&#xD;
yet returned.&#xD;
The moon and the stars looked down upon them; the&#xD;
birds twittered; the wind sighed through the long ,moss;&#xD;
the sea moaned in the distance, and still he kielt, ~and still&#xD;
her eyes were closed-only for a moment had they opened&#xD;
~-aud still her lips were sealed. At length this age of&#xD;

THE PIONIO.&#xD;
&#xD;
suspense to D'Estaing was ended. flaising herself slowly&#xD;
up, she looked at him in a bewildered and pitiably help&#xD;
less manner.&#xD;
Supporting her in his arms, he whispered, "Maud,'&#xD;
how h~s all this been brought about? Oh that I might&#xD;
always have the privilege of thus sheltering you beside xxty&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
With the little strength left at command, she disen'&#xD;
gaged herself from his embrace, and replied,&#xD;
"I must not listen to you, Mr. ]YEstaing~ I am a&#xD;
wife!" then crawling a short distance from him, she fell&#xD;
from exhaustion, and gr~velling upon the earth, sobbed in&#xD;
the agony of an aching heart.&#xD;
"Ah, do I not know that to my sorrow?" was the pas..&#xD;
sionate declaration breathed in her ear, as he lifted hei&#xD;
trembling form and clasped her to his bosom. "But&#xD;
you are mine, Maud, by a right stronger than any bond&#xD;
of man, by a love I cannot and would~not control. You&#xD;
are mine, in the sight of Heaven."&#xD;
"Spare me!" she cried with quivering lips.. "Go and&#xD;
leave me, I beseech you, unless you would make me for~&#xD;
feit my honor."&#xD;
"And going would not abate my love, Maud," lie&#xD;
whispered.&#xD;
"Why did you not let me die in the waters'&#xD;
sobbecL.&#xD;
"1 wished you to live to bless me with your love," he&#xD;
selfishly answered.&#xD;
Taxing her strength to the utmost, she lifted herself from&#xD;
his embrace, and cried with vehemence, "To curse you,&#xD;
rather. What can this love be but a curse to both of u&amp;amp; ~f,&#xD;

"hell itself, Maud, would be. heaven,, if your love could&#xD;
follow rue there," he said under his breath.&#xD;
"For heaven's sake!" she cried, "do not talk so reck.&#xD;
lessly. , Even now I feet the curse of God is testing upon&#xD;
both of us." Then, as if a sudden recollection had swept&#xD;
away all thought of the present, she asked with trembling&#xD;
eagerness,&#xD;
"Where is Captain Beall? Did you let him perish?"&#xD;
"There!" said ID'Estaing, pointing to where he lay.&#xD;
"Drowned?" she cried, shading her face with her cold&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
"Great God! I fear so!" he answered, as he led the&#xD;
way to the spot where Beall was lying.&#xD;
Kneeling beside him, they both felt in vain for any&#xD;
sign of life. There was none. The bounding heart was&#xD;
stilled forever. lIe was even then stiff and cold. This&#xD;
fact flashed first across the mind of D'Estaing; but it did&#xD;
not seem to reach Maud's comprehension.&#xD;
"What is to~ be done?" she said imploringly.&#xD;
"Heaven only knows," he answered, "unless you can&#xD;
watch here while I go to the island for assistance. It is&#xD;
not more than a mile, and Ii can soon swim it."&#xD;
"Watch here alone?" she asked, with a shudder creep-&#xD;
ing ovei her and a vague sense of the real situation.&#xD;
"I hate to ask it, my darling," lie said tenderly, kneel-&#xD;
ing beside her and taking her hands in his; "hut poor&#xD;
Beall is already dead, and his body must have some atten&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"Do not leave me!" she cried, like a terroi'-strickera&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
ThE ~io:~rio.              I$~T&#xD;
child. "I cannot remain here alone. They will surely&#xD;
come in search of us."&#xD;
"As you say, then," he returned, taking hei' head on&#xD;
his bosom and stroking her wet haii'. "I would Ie~u1d ~&#xD;
never be compelled to leave you." And thus, in the delh'.&#xD;
hun of sin, they told their love beside the dead.&#xD;
Alreac~y their brows were wreathed with cypress, and&#xD;
the altar xvhereo~i they placed their idol was bathed in&#xD;
tears. "Tears from the depths of a divine despair," a'hun~&#xD;
gem that lived ir~ their hearts. Could they not see "the&#xD;
hand-writing on the wall ?"&#xD;
There had been two declarations followed by two&#xD;
deaths. Was it the funeral of their hopes-the guilty&#xD;
shadow of their crime that thus tracked them, clad in&#xD;
sombre weeds of mourning. Alas! the trail of the ser-&#xD;
pent followed them, and they xvalked blindly to the end.&#xD;
It was a picture worthy of Rembrandt, with its ghastlp~&#xD;
lio'hts and shadows, as these two wretched beings sat in&#xD;
depths of the forest, silently watching beside the still&#xD;
form of the sleeper, sleeping "the sleep that knows n.o&#xD;
waking." T he water lapsed and moaned and gurgled as&#xD;
V the wind tossed the waves; the long gray moss sighed and&#xD;
whispered in the night breeze; the moonbeams shim~&#xD;
mncred timidly through the overhanging boughs of the&#xD;
trees; the shrill cry of the curlews name up like grief~&#xD;
notes for the dead, arid divided the sounds that broke the&#xD;
awful stillness of the night, with Maud's heart-wrung&#xD;
sighs and tears. The night advanced, but no relief came;&#xD;
and, like two guilty spectres, they sat still and silent in the&#xD;
alternate lights and shadows.&#xD;
"flow selfish I am!" Mand exclaimed at last. "Foi&#xD;

&#xD;
Heaven's sake, go at once, and bring some one to take&#xD;
care of my poor friend."'&#xD;
"It is too late now," said ID'Estaing. "I shall not leave&#xD;
you here alone, so we must take the consequences."&#xD;
Drawing close to the dead body, she stroked the white&#xD;
~forehead and placed her slender hand on the mute hips.&#xD;
"So cold and still I" she murmured. "Who could have&#xD;
thought of this, this morning. Oh, what a miserable&#xD;
wretch I am!"&#xD;
Just then a shout rang out, clearly and distinctly, upon&#xD;
the midnight air. They both sprang to their feet, and&#xD;
their hearts beat' with gratitude as D'Estaiig responded.&#xD;
They knew that help was at hand. Still another and an~&#xD;
other greeting was exchano'ed until all the woods re.&#xD;
verberated with the 'welcome sounds.&#xD;
Soon a boat came in sight as it glided gracefully&#xD;
around a curve, and a party of friends, having stepped&#xD;
ashore, were congratulating Maud upon her~~ safety. But'&#xD;
their joy was instantly changed to sorrow. Beall was a&#xD;
great favorite, and as they beheld him sti~etclied in the cold&#xD;
calm of death, their laughter was turned into mourning.&#xD;
In as few words as possible D'Estaimig 'related the story&#xD;
of the sad disaster. Tenderly they lifted and laid his r&amp;amp;&#xD;
mains jn the boat, and silently taking their seats, floated&#xD;
over the moonlighted waters to the island. They soon&#xD;
came in sight, and the whole expectant party who were&#xD;
standing on the shore greeted them with waving hand.&#xD;
kemThiefs and loud hurrahs. But soon the rejoicing was&#xD;
changed to weeping, anid humbled before the awful dis~&#xD;
sensation of Providence they rePirned to the 6ity, wiser,&#xD;
perhaps better, for the terrible lesson of the feeble tenure&#xD;
which is held upon life.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIY.&#xD;
A LETTER.&#xD;
BOUT a week after the picnic, a small company&#xD;
were as mbled one evening at the residence' of&#xD;
Colonel rtridge. iMlaud was playing for them&#xD;
to dance, while D'Estaing, who never indulged in this in~&#xD;
nocent amusement, stood near, twirling the tassel of a fan,&#xD;
and stealing furtive glances at the beautiful profile of the&#xD;
performer.&#xD;
Finally his protracted silence became embarrassing, and&#xD;
although it was a moment of ecstasy, Maud said, under&#xD;
her breath,&#xD;
"Why don't you talk?"&#xD;
2l3ending gracefully over her he whispered softly,&#xD;
"Ian~ ~oo haypy."&#xD;
His face was radiant, and her glorious eyes sank be~&#xD;
neath his buining gaze, while her cheeks flushed crimson.&#xD;
After a few moments of pretty confusion, Maud looked&#xD;
up and said,&#xD;
"Do you like to receive letters?"&#xD;
"I think it is one of the greatest pleasures in life-.that&#xD;
is, it must be."&#xD;
"iMlust be?"&#xD;
"Yes, to those who have dear ones to write to them."&#xD;
"Really~then, have you no loved ones with whom you&#xD;
correspond?"'&#xD;
"Not a human being," he said sadly.&#xD;
"Suppose I should Write to you?"&#xD;
"Do not tantalize me."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8258-00000080"/>&#xD;
100            A LETE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Nothing is further from my thoughts. But what&#xD;
would you think, should Ii write you?"&#xD;
"Did it contain what my heart is dying for, I should&#xD;
be, of all men, the most happy. I can scarcely be more&#xD;
wretched thaii I am, no matter what were its contents. It&#xD;
would require but two little words to consummate my&#xD;
joy or seal my woe."&#xD;
"What are they?"&#xD;
"Pope."&#xD;
"And the other?"&#xD;
"Foro'et"&#xD;
Quickly slipping from her belt a piece of paper closely&#xD;
folded, she laid it, upon the keys of the instrument, and&#xD;
looking up at him said,&#xD;
"it is yours."&#xD;
The act was so adroitly performed as not to attract at~&#xD;
tension, and pressing the note to his lips, a moment after.&#xD;
ward, D'Estaing said,&#xD;
"Does it contain either of the two words?"&#xD;
"Edo not know-don't, ask me-but leave me now, 1&#xD;
beseech you. This effort is too much, and I am ready to&#xD;
sink to the floor."&#xD;
"Your humblest desire is my greatest pleasure. Good~&#xD;
night."&#xD;
They exchanged a hasty, but meaning glance, and mak-.,&#xD;
ing his exit through a side door, he disappeared without&#xD;
being observed or missed by the gay dancers. Rushing&#xD;
madly along the streets, he soon gained his room, and&#xD;
tearing open the letter, read the following:&#xD;
"That this qff~air, which was revealed to us by the&#xD;
~nerest accident, must end, you will readily appreciate~&#xD;
&#xD;
60&#xD;
&#xD;
A LETTER.                  161   ~&#xD;
I am another's, and we can and must only meet in the fit.&#xD;
tare as casual friends. You are a strpng man, i but a&#xD;
weak woman; and I demand your assistance in the pem&#xD;
forinance of my duty elsewhere. Let all things be as for&#xD;
merly, or else, Ii must implore you to fly, to leave me-to&#xD;
go-to put oceans and seas between us,---to forget me--to&#xD;
bury me in oblivion, while my prayers and tears shall ac~&#xD;
company you.&#xD;
In agony,&#xD;
D'Estaing read the letter time and again, until every&#xD;
word seemed branded in his heart. He pressed it to hi~&#xD;
lips, then walked the floor, and the more he thought on&#xD;
the impossibility of ever making the loved one his, the&#xD;
mote intense grew his passion-the wilder his despair.&#xD;
Then lie would reason with himself, and vow that he&#xD;
would think of her no more-that he' would forget her,&#xD;
and yielding to her request, leave the country and return&#xD;
to his old life of roaming. But what reason or philosophy&#xD;
has ever stood the test of a great, strong passion? All&#xD;
theories a~re shaken by it, even as the monarchs of the&#xD;
forest are riven by the whirlwind. W1~at pledges have&#xD;
not been dissipated in its elysian dreams, even as the mist&#xD;
is dissolved before the rising sun? So it was with D'Es~&#xD;
taing! Life had dawned anew, and the world, which for&#xD;
years' had held nothing for him but wretchedness, sud'&#xD;
denly became resplendent with incQnceivable ecstasy&#xD;
A)e all-powerful and uncontrollable passion which had  N&#xD;
hiken such violent possession of his soul tinged all things  7&#xD;
with noonday splendor, and he sighed heavily as asking&#xD;
himself if he should so soon relinquish the treasur6w~l~ieb&#xD;

he h~d just found. Opening the window and gazing out&#xD;
into the calm, still night, lie fancied the moon shimmered&#xD;
with more softened rays and that the "twinkling stars were&#xD;
Ianghing," as if to congratulate him upon his new-foimd&#xD;
bliss. He leaned out of the window, and as the night air&#xD;
fanned his heated brow, revelled in delicious dreams. But&#xD;
only for a little while did he bask in these ecstatic fancies,&#xD;
for soon he thought, "What madness-what folly for me&#xD;
to love this woman. It might have been, 'but not now.&#xD;
What misery in the thought. No-her position must not&#xD;
be sacrificed-her honor is sacred, and, by the powers&#xD;
above, I will protect it with my latest breath. 1 must&#xD;
leave her. IL will quit the country and return to my old&#xD;
life of wandering and homelessness." Then the tempter&#xD;
would whisper, "Why should I? heaven knows, my&#xD;
life has had few pleasures enough, andwhymaylnoten&#xD;
joy those so bewitchingly held out to me now? Why may&#xD;
I not love and be beloved?"&#xD;
These delusive fantasies were almost instantly dispelled&#xD;
though, and in the next moment he was saying,&#xD;
"Am IL a man of honor? her husband my best friend?&#xD;
What perfidy! I will ciusli these feelings from out my&#xD;
heart, if they cost me my life." And thus did the day.&#xD;
dawn find him struggling with the passion which threa~&#xD;
ened to engulf him in the whirlpool of its ma~ilstroin.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
IN THE DEPTHS.&#xD;
/ S IMlaud sat alone, the next evening, in the win.&#xD;
dow of the conservatory that opened on the en~&#xD;
trance, these words of Byron came into her&#xD;
mind:&#xD;
"Oh, love! what is it in this world of ours&#xD;
Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why,&#xD;
With cypress branches hast thou wreathed thy bowers,&#xD;
And made thy best interpreter a sigh?"&#xD;
Thus, mentally soliloquizing, she thought on the b~'il~&#xD;
liant and erratic genius who penned these lines, and won~&#xD;
dered what exquisite torture had induced them. Then,&#xD;
plucking a cluster of flowers, and pinning them in her&#xD;
aorsage, as some dim-remembered song, the remaining&#xD;
lines sprang to her lips, and she said half-aloud,&#xD;
"As those who dote on odors pluck the flowers,&#xD;
And place them oz~ their breast-but place to die-..&#xD;
Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish&#xD;
Are laid within our bosoms but to perish."&#xD;
Yes! even as quickly as the perfume of flowers passes&#xD;
away will that love die which fancy paints eternal But&#xD;
who believes it?&#xD;
Does a day of change, of neglect, ~nd of coldness, ever&#xD;
dim the rainbow-tinted dreams of those who revel in the~&#xD;
fairy domains of love? Ah, no! each one considers him.&#xD;
self an exception to a rule , which, alas! has proven but&#xD;
too general, until the cruel awakening comes,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

164               IN THE DEPTHS.                                          IN THE DEPTHS.               165&#xD;
&#xD;
'What though despair and hopelessness were mingled&#xD;
with iMlaud's guilty love, no cruel thought suggested even&#xD;
the possibility of a change, as sitting~, in the gloaming,&#xD;
with the evening breeze lightly kissing her brow, she&#xD;
wondered if it bore to her the sighs of some other be~&#xD;
ing as wretched as herself. Then, as she watched the&#xD;
staid's peep forth one by one, and s~w them twinkle so&#xD;
Therrily, she wondered again if misery was known in&#xD;
those far-off realms that looked so bright? Then she&#xD;
thought on the inconsistencies of life. I' Our life is two.&#xD;
fold," says Byron; but he refers only to the hours of wak~&#xD;
ing and sleeping. Is it not rather two-fold when wake&#xD;
ing, or as. that fascinating writer, Owen Meredith, cx.&#xD;
presses it,&#xD;
"Stilt, as once with the actors in Greece, 'tis the case,&#xD;
Each must speak to the crowd with a mask on his face."&#xD;
How true this is, fQr who carries his heart in his face&#xD;
for the vulgar gaze of the public, and how little do men&#xD;
know of eaeh other.&#xD;
It is often true that those who are most envied, and&#xD;
w~o are apparently the gayest of the gay, are but masked&#xD;
pieces of wretchedness.- There is but one eye, though,&#xD;
that can penetrate the hidden cavernS of the human&#xD;
heart, and read what is written there, as there. is but one&#xD;
T3eiug who can change w ailing into songs of joy.&#xD;
The world said, Maud had everything to be envied for&#xD;
-a good husband, a home of luxury, friends by the&#xD;
legion, youth, beauty, and accomplishments. 'What more&#xD;
could be desired?&#xD;
How little did they know that all this failed to answer&#xD;
the demands of a heart that ~4~:dying to be loved. how&#xD;
&#xD;
little did they dream that she arose from the feast hungry,&#xD;
and departed from the wine-table thirsty.&#xD;
While silently indulging these sad musings the death~&#xD;
like quiet that reigned was broken by the gentle fall of&#xD;
footsteps. They were not hurried, like those that bear&#xD;
glad tidings, but were slow and measured, like those that&#xD;
follow in some funeral train.&#xD;
Maud shuddered with ill-defined fears, then trembled&#xD;
with a kind of painful joy, as ID'E~taing stood before her;&#xD;
for she felt that those were his footsteps even when he&#xD;
himself was invisible. His manner was hurried and ex-&#xD;
cited, while she looked as though chiseled ouf of marble;&#xD;
but beneath that cold exterior burned a living fire, which&#xD;
would only be quenched in death.&#xD;
"Good-evening," he said softly, and, lifting his hat&#xD;
gracefully, seated himself on a step at her feet.&#xD;
She did not speak, b~it only smiled and extended the&#xD;
tips of her fingers, which he warmly grasped, as he tossed&#xD;
into her lap what seemed to be a letter, although it bore&#xD;
no superscription.&#xD;
As she eagerly seized it, he said hurriedly, "In those&#xD;
pages you will find something like a reply to the letter&#xD;
you gave me last evening. Promise me that you will an-&#xD;
swer it, and that you will not keep me in suspense."&#xD;
11cr heart was throbbing m adly, but her voice betrayed&#xD;
no emotion, as she saul,&#xD;
"I promise."&#xD;
For a few minutes there was silence, then springing up,&#xD;
.D'Estaing said, "Adie~t.f"&#xD;
Their hand3 were clasped as if never to part, and in a&#xD;
voice tremulous with suppressed emotion, Mau&amp;amp; said,&#xD;
"Will you ~ot remain t&amp;amp; tea?"&#xD;

I.. ~&#xD;
~' flow could '1? 1 have no de4e for food, and t~&#xD;
attempt to eat, seated by your side, i~ a mockery I do not'&#xD;
care to enact."&#xD;
Still clasping her hand, the storm which raged in&#xD;
heart broke forth in a torrent as he said,&#xD;
"My l9ve fills heart and soul and engrosses every ~&#xD;
thought. L~It is the ruling passion of my life-it is misery&#xD;
to be separated fro you, and it is torture t~4e with you.&#xD;
You love me; you d not tell me so, but I 'feel it;, I know&#xD;
it; and yet you co~ ld find it in your heart to write that&#xD;

"Would you have the fate of a criminal linked witfr&#xD;
yours?" sounded harshly in the deepening twilight. 'iI~&#xD;
"You would be ~no more criminal then than nowV"&#xD;
and Maud's sensltA~e nature fancied that there was ~a&#xD;
covert sneer beneath these words of passion. Stung to&#xD;
the quick, she jerked her hand from his clasp which was&#xD;
almost painful, and saying, "It is well your words recall&#xD;
me to a sense of propriety, and remind me that I must&#xD;
not listen to you," without another word she quickly&#xD;
entered the house, while he walked slowly away&#xD;
Locked within he~ chamber, she st6od beneath the gas-&#xD;
light a few moment~ afterward, reading the following:&#xD;
"Could I unbosom all that which now burns and thrill~&#xD;
within me, you would then know how deeply, how devo-&#xD;
tedly, and how entirely I love you.{ Could I but lay bare&#xD;
my heart, that you might' see its every pulsation, you&#xD;

to the future; change and clouds will come soon enough.&#xD;
Why hasten them? You are mine by that invisible&#xD;
power which scorns conventionalities and unites hearts&#xD;
in bonds that cannot be sundered. A love as pure and un*&#xD;
defiled as ours might call forth the approbatiQn of even&#xD;
the angels in heaven. It is not of our making, and has&#xD;
none of the taint or drQss of earth in it, and yet you&#xD;
talk of parting. Recall those cruel words, and write me,&#xD;
if but one word, to bid me koy~.&#xD;
"Only yo~u~rs,&#xD;
When she had finished reading, the letter was blotted&#xD;
and stained with tears, and still the torrent ixured, as if&#xD;
that would ease her bursting heart.&#xD;
To hope, was sin-to love, was crime; none knew this&#xD;
better than Maud, and without acknowledging it to her~&#xD;
self, she did both.&#xD;
She felt that she was a treacherous wife in thought, if&#xD;
not in deed, and her heart ached with conflicting emotions.&#xD;
Realizing at length that the indulgence of grief is a'&#xD;
luxury not to be enjoyed by the guilty with impunity, she&#xD;
joined the gay party below, only to find the evening in.&#xD;
terminally long and weary.&#xD;

"The stars above were brightly shining,&#xD;
Because they'd nothing else to do."&#xD;
&#xD;
OAPUOIIIN preached one day on the marvels of&#xD;
nature. "My brethren," he said, "you wonder&#xD;
at many things, while others that are by far more&#xD;
Important seem not to affect you. at all. Thus, for in-&#xD;
stance, you admire the sun, and appreciate the moon very&#xD;
little; and yet the latter sheds her rays dyer you when&#xD;
the darkness of night would fright en you, while the sun&#xD;
r shines only in the broad daylight." When Madame de&#xD;
Sta~l heard this anecdote, she exclaimed, "The Capuchin&#xD;
was a ~avi~nt. We ought to have made him -acquainted&#xD;
with Buffon."&#xD;
On the, night in question the stars twinkled as merrily,&#xD;
the moon shoi~ as calmly, the sky was as cloudless, as if&#xD;
hunger ~nd poverty, crime and murder, sin and death, did&#xD;
;~ ziot stalk abroad over this beautiful earth.&#xD;

What am Eden this earth Would be if its denizens&#xD;

On this same evening, in a chamber where there was&#xD;

"TIlE STARS ABOVE WERE BRIGhTLY ShINING."&#xD;
to iuifold their bright pages, and read therein his destiny.&#xD;
Long and silent he sat there, and the mental soliloquy&#xD;
in which he indulged, ran thus:&#xD;
"She is going away, and without the slightest intima-&#xD;
tion or one word of parting. Well! let her go. She is&#xD;
like all the rest, fair and false, arid II will endeavor to forget&#xD;
her as she has forgotten me. I will pluck her image&#xD;
from my heart though it cost me my life. Who talks of&#xD;
forgetting ~ Alas, it is easy to talk, but how difficult to&#xD;
erase from the memory those forms which are branded&#xD;
on the heart! I have not been near her, but Heaven&#xD;
knows it was for her sake, not mine; for did I consult&#xD;
my own feelings, I should be by her side eternally."&#xD;
Then, ~vith fresh regret, he said, "Why has this pew-found&#xD;
bliss been born to me but to perish? Why could I not&#xD;
have gone on in the same loneliness without knowing&#xD;
that there could exist for me a brighter day? I know&#xD;
that the indulgence of this passion is incompatible with&#xD;
my ideas of honor, but why talk of love and honor?&#xD;
Suppose even Aristides and Cupid were weighed in the&#xD;
same scales, who doubts but they would lean to the side&#xD;
of the latter? But still, as a man claiming to understand&#xD;
thoroughly the code of moral ethics, I hate myself for not&#xD;
crushing these feelings, as I would smother the flame&#xD;
kindled by the midnight incendiary~ II must see her&#xD;
once more; and then-~and then- But the future&#xD;
must take care of itself."&#xD;
Springing up, he followed the direction of his thoughts,&#xD;
a short walk brought him to the desired haven, whe~&#xD;
the well-known sounds of Beethoven's "MQonli~ht" ien-&#xD;

With pleasure rather beaming from her eyes than ex~&#xD;
pressed in her manner, INland said,&#xD;
"I'm delighted to see you! Why, what a stranger you&#xD;
are!"&#xD;
Pressing the small white hand which still rested con&#xD;
Iidingly in his, he said,&#xD;
"Pray go~on with your music, as I fear it will be a&#xD;
long time before I shall have the pleasure of hearing you&#xD;
scram."&#xD;
With an astonished air, she said,&#xD;
"Why do you say so? Does the accomplished editor&#xD;
of the Times contemplate an absence from the city?"&#xD;
"If your description refers to rnys~lf, I do not intend&#xD;
the city; but I have heard that you did."&#xD;
is a mistake."&#xD;
Why, this is very strange! I heard you expected to&#xD;
start North to-morrow, and came to pay my adieux."'&#xD;
"Oh! Well, Colonel Hartridge and the girls are&#xD;
going, and I was to have- gone with them, but have aban-&#xD;
doned the trip. So I hope it will be a long time before&#xD;
you have occasion to pay your adieux to me."&#xD;
"God grant it!" he said with so much earnestness,&#xD;
that the tell-tale blushes crimsoned INland's cheeks.&#xD;
"Wait until I start for Europe, or become a voluntary&#xD;
exile, or an inmate of some convent, or a lone wanderer&#xD;
in the deserts of Arabia,' or a weary pilgrim dragging my&#xD;
aching feet toward Mecca,---then you may say 'good.&#xD;

"And who may that one be?" she asked, in a coquet.&#xD;
Lish manner that was entirely foreign to her.&#xD;
It is said that every woman has a spice of coquetry iii&#xD;
her nature; but perhaps what is known as that feeling&#xD;
may be only a great desire to be doubly assured of that&#xD;
love and sympathy whhh are so necessary to her happi-&#xD;
ness. Naturally enough, D'Estaing had fallen into this&#xD;
erroneous impression, which exists in the world, and ~he&#xD;
was a little piqued, as he said:&#xD;
"Ask your own heart."&#xD;
"And what if that should not answer truly?" she&#xD;
answered, in a spirit of merriment.&#xD;
"A woman's heart, when in converse with itself, and&#xD;
no eye save that of God beholds it, will answer truly..&#xD;
No matter how false it may be to the world,~ it has its&#xD;
honest hour, like that which comes to men when they are&#xD;
dying. At such an hour, I bid you answer my question."&#xD;
INlaud had become rather restive under thi~ solemn&#xD;
rebuke, but, with a feminine determination not to yield&#xD;
an iota, asked, with apparent frivolity:&#xD;
~ And what about mejn's hearts?"&#xD;
He looked at her closely for a moment, to see, if possi~&#xD;
ble, whether she were only jesting, or whether she was in&#xD;
earnest~; then, in a wounded tone, said:&#xD;
"If you knew how this trifling grated upon a heart&#xD;
that' is already tortured beyond description, you would&#xD;
cease your taunts. - But how can a woman, whose highest&#xD;
ambition is to outnumber her sisters in victims, be ex-&#xD;
pected to know anything of mercy!"&#xD;
"She cannot know anything of it, because it is a&#xD;
Divine attribute; and of course, if we are the fiends you&#xD;
put Us, we must be strangers to this beautiful vi~ttie."&#xD;

ID'Estaing had arisen, and stood before her, with ii&#xD;
nation flashing from his eyes. for, at the moment, h~&#xD;
believed her to be as false as she was fair. What great&#xD;
injustice he did her, those alone know who can penetrate&#xD;
the hidden recesses of her heart, and see with what&#xD;
idolatry she worshipped him. her pride asked, what&#xD;
right he had to arraign her in such a manner for a few&#xD;
idle words; and as she sat there, feigning the indifference&#xD;
she did not feel, it was to see&#xD;
"How light a cause may move&#xD;
Dissension be~weex~ Iwarts that love."&#xD;
No ready reply sprang to her lips, and, after a few&#xD;
moments of pair~ful silence, iD'Estaing said "good even~&#xD;
ing," and, without awaiting an answer, quietly left~ the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
Maud sprang up, and the great desire of her heart was&#xD;
to rush after him-to bring him back-to crouch at his&#xD;
feet and implore his pardon. But no; it would never do&#xD;
p      to follow him, for women are bound down like slaves to&#xD;
the conventionalities of society; and, sinking down in&#xD;
wretchedness, she thought she too would go away on the&#xD;
morrow, and never, never see him again.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
A. MIDNIGHT REVELATION.&#xD;
IIEQUENT letters from the absent ones assured&#xD;
Maud of their welfare and happiness; while&#xD;
newspaper notices of the beauty and attractions&#xD;
of both Kate and Daisy filled her heart with pride.&#xD;
They had first visited the Greenbrier Springs pf Vir..&#xD;
ginia, where were gathered a society of chivalric men&#xD;
and refined women which would have graced the most&#xD;
.fastidiot~s European court. From thence they had gone&#xD;
to New York, Saratoga, Niagara, and, when last heard&#xD;
from, were en route to Long Branch.&#xD;
Ruth Leigh was with Maud, and but fork their music,&#xD;
the time, which passed wearily enough, would~ have been&#xD;
intolerable. Three weeks had dragged slowly by, but&#xD;
brought no glimpse of him who filled the heart, mind,&#xD;
and soul of Maud llartridge. Had he left the city? or&#xD;
had he voluntarily abandoned her to suffer the penalty of&#xD;
her transgression? These questions were asked time and,&#xD;
again, but no answer came, and she still groped in fri~&#xD;
penetrable darkness. One ~evening, just at this tim~,&#xD;
Maud, Ruthiand Guy were taking tea, in real Southern&#xD;
style, upon the galle The air was perfumed with&#xD;
night-blooming jasmi and roses, and th~ soft moonlight&#xD;
flooded everything with its silvery light. The converse~&#xD;
tion was general, Guy taking the lead, of course, when,&#xD;
unexpectedly, Mr. D'Estaing joined them. After pre.&#xD;
renting him to Ruth, Maud said,&#xD;
"I thought you must have left the city."&#xD;

174           A ~tIDNIGHT REVELATION.&#xD;
"Ne; I have been ill," he answered.&#xD;
"Ill ?" replied Maud, in a tone of pain and surprise;&#xD;
and as the gas-light just then fell full upon his fa6e, she&#xD;
started~'a't its paleness. Without another word to him,&#xD;
she proposed going in and having some music.&#xD;
Ruth's voice was highly cultivated, and~, after singing&#xD;
quite a number of classical selections, she pleaded a head.&#xD;
ache, and, retiring, left Maud and D'Estaing alone.&#xD;
They looked at each other for a moment, but as neither&#xD;
seemed ready to make the first advance, INland resumed&#xD;
her seat at the piano, and wandered off into Gottschalk's&#xD;
"Last' hope."&#xD;
"flow ~R~OYO8 of my feelings!" said D'Estaing, lean.&#xD;
ing over the piano; "for it is a last, dying, glimmering&#xD;
hope, that has brought me here to-night. Come~4or the&#xD;
first time I do not wisb~ to hear you play. I must talk to&#xD;
you!" And, taking her by the hand, he led her to a&#xD;
"Have you read 'Tricotrin'?" he asked.&#xD;
"Then you sent me the book? I suspected 'as much.&#xD;
Yes, I have read it. Is he not glorious! But is it not&#xD;
deplorable to think that such noble~ selfJsacrificing, and&#xD;
devoted spirits, live only in romance?"&#xD;
"More's the pity that such love as his should have been&#xD;
returned with such base ingratitude! ". was the sarcastic&#xD;
reply. '&#xD;
"Do not think for an instant that I would shield Viva;&#xD;
and believe me, I altogether condemn her utter heartless.&#xD;
Doss. But' you will agree with me when I say that&#xD;
women, as a class, are more entirely unselfish in their&#xD;
loves than men."&#xD;
"I have known only one instance," he said, bitterly.&#xD;
&#xD;
A MID IIGUT REVELATION.&#xD;
Could it be himself he had reference to, Maud thought.&#xD;
That there was some mystery surrounding his life, the&#xD;
depths of which she had not yet penetrated, was evident;&#xD;
but, eagerly proceeding with the conversation, she said,&#xD;
~vith intense feeling, and as if talking to herself:&#xD;
"Ah, how I could worship such a man as Tricotrin!"&#xD;
"Bestow your worship upon a real, a living, a breath~&#xD;
ing Tricotrin. Let me be all, and more, to you, than he&#xD;
ever was to Viva." And, pausing from excess of enio~&#xD;
tion, hc clasped her to his heart, and gazed into her um&#xD;
turned eyes, which were radiant with the intense love&#xD;
she vainly strove to conceaL "But, 0 ~misery!" and&#xD;
putting her from him, ~he said,' "Why do I talk thus,&#xD;
and fo 'get that you. are another's?" lie paused; then,&#xD;
scrutinizing her closely, said,' in trembling accents, "And&#xD;
yot&amp;amp; 1ov~ him ~"&#xD;
A guilty start, a deep sigh, and an undisguised glance, A&#xD;
spoke the volumes which words would have failed to&#xD;
express, and but addcd fresh torture to the heart of the&#xD;
'interrogator, as they revealed the true state of her feel.&#xD;
mgs.&#xD;
The silence which followed was oppressive, freighted&#xD;
as it was with the spasmodic gasps of one and the quick&#xD;
breathing of the other. Then, from the depths of agony&#xD;
with which his heart was bursting, D'Estaing said~&#xD;
"Maud, I must speak to you to-night; and~ yet, death&#xD;
were preferable. Some power, which I cannot control,&#xD;
urges me to the performance of this painful duty; and&#xD;
God knows, I 'long for that human sympathy which I&#xD;
know you will give me, as no man ever yearned b6fo#e."&#xD;

some horrible vision, such an 'agonizing groan eseape~1&#xD;

&#xD;
him as made Maud shudder. Some little time elapsed~&#xD;
then, as if driven to speak, he said,&#xD;
"As set, you know nothing of me."&#xD;
"I dc~ not wish to know anything " she said, quickly,&#xD;
a~ a presentiment of evil caine over her.&#xD;
"But you must know it, and hear it you shall. Then,&#xD;
if you can love ~ why, neither God nor man shall keep&#xD;
us apart."&#xD;
As a wife, iMlaud lnew full well the treachery of li~.&#xD;
tending to such language, and an accusing conscience&#xD;
forced the conviction upon her, that this guilty 'love could&#xD;
be nothing but a curse to both. To check a tornado in&#xD;
its fury would be as easy as to recede now; and, in the&#xD;
silence of that hour, she felt that the warnings which&#xD;
were whispered in her ears came too late. During the&#xD;
short interval that these thoughts filled he~Vmind, D'Es~.&#xD;
tailig sat with bowed head, and, sighed deeply. Suddenly&#xD;
looking up, and as if urged by some inv~ible power, he&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"My parents died when I was so young that I do not&#xD;
remember them, and my earliest recAlections are asso~&#xD;
~iated with a gentle sister, and a co4sin whom I always&#xD;
regarded as a brother. We were the ;last surviving mem-&#xD;
bers of an old and aristocratic house our ancestors hav~&#xD;
ing emigrated to this country when Louisiana owed alle-&#xD;
giance to the French Government. Consumption was&#xD;
hereditary in both families, and few of them ever attained&#xD;
even the full maturity of years. Thus, Gustave T~ela~&#xD;
mere's parents and ours all died within the short period&#xD;
of six years, 'and we three orphans, who were the last&#xD;
remaining on~s of 'the two houses, were confided to th~&#xD;

all parties. lie was a prominent and wealthy banker in&#xD;
New Orleans at that time, where we wei~e all born and&#xD;
partially reared. Gustave was my junior by two years,&#xD;
Marie being still younger; they were thrown much more&#xD;
together, and it was but natural that this love, which they&#xD;
felt for each~ other in childhood, should ripen into some-&#xD;
thing warmer as the years advanced. I hailed this state&#xD;
of affair's with delight for our houses. had always inter-&#xD;
married; and to have the two remaining branches united&#xD;
was al~nost more than I could have hoped for. Gustave&#xD;
always called her his 'little wife' when they were at.&#xD;
play; and Marie blushingly declared he. was to be her&#xD;
'husband when they grew to be big.' Well, the years&#xD;
flew by on golden wings, and soon we had crossed the&#xD;
Atlantic, according to our father's desires, where Gustave&#xD;
and myself were placed at school in Germany, and Marie&#xD;
was sent to Paris. If young hearts were ever torn with&#xD;
~g, they were ours when we kissed Marie '~eod~by1.'&#xD;
'We had never known a grief before, and we fancied w~&#xD;
could not bear the separation. ]3ut young nature~&#xD;
elastic, and, in the novelty of everything by which we&#xD;
were surrounded, our hearts soon rebounded~ and we&#xD;
were as happy as ever. Daily letters from M~4e~, kept us&#xD;
apprised of all her movements, and she, too, seemed t~&#xD;
have recovered her usual spirits. Gustave was wayward,&#xD;
impulsive, and generous to a fault, but the soul of honor~&#xD;
I firmly believed. His frank, open nature, made him ten&#xD;
friends where I had not one, and he was the acknowl-&#xD;
edged favorite of the school. He was quick and b~ril-&#xD;
'liant, and won, as many honors as I did, although I studied&#xD;
much, more assiduously. B~t the three years here were~&#xD;
numbered with the past before we dreamed of it; aud&#xD;

A 'MIDNIGHT REVELATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
now, after a season in Paris, we were to return to 'Home,&#xD;
sweet home!' So, to Paris we went, where our delight&#xD;
at seeing Marie again exceeded all bounds, and Gustave&#xD;
danced for very joy, while I pressed her to my 'heart and'&#xD;
kissed her time and again. She was wonderfully devel-&#xD;
oped, and, I thought, the loveliest woman I had. ever seen.&#xD;
She was grace itself, and in her manners combined the&#xD;
intensity of the Spanish with the vivacity of the French;&#xD;
and I did not think it an exaggeration whcn Gustave pro-&#xD;
nounced her perfect. She seemed the world to him, and&#xD;
for a short time all went as merry as a marriage-bell. It&#xD;
was not to be wondered at that Gustave, with his impul-&#xD;
sive nature, which had always been unchecked,'~"should&#xD;
plunge into every species of gayety and dissipation with&#xD;
all the excess of a novice. Marie implored me with tear-&#xD;
ful eyes to remonstrate with him; ~but II did not do it, for&#xD;
I thought he was only 'sowing his wild oats,' and would&#xD;
soon return to a more settled life. Instead of improving,&#xD;
matters grew worse day by day; all attempts to reclaim,&#xD;
or even influence him, were ineffectual, and at length the&#xD;
painful trath was forced upon me, that he was 'joined to&#xD;
his idols.' When Marie interceded, it only chafed, and&#xD;
made him ify to new excesses in which to drown his re-&#xD;
morse; while she-poor gii4 1-was wild with grief. She&#xD;
had not left the boarding-school of Madame F , and&#xD;
much subsequent suffering might have been spared her,&#xD;
which resulted from this change. Our guardian, not&#xD;
beii~g able 'to remain abroad, had confided her to the care&#xD;
of a Mr. and Mrs. Duponte, so. soon as her term at school&#xD;
should expire. Although unknown to us, they were&#xD;
'acquaintances of his, and residents of New Orleans, but&#xD;

A MIDNIGHT REVELATION.          1'I J&#xD;
ponte had called, and Marie had spent several evenings&#xD;
with her; but the innocent child never suspected that the&#xD;
devil lurked beneath the glare and glitter of that brilliant&#xD;
hotel. They soon discovered and sought Gustave, as they&#xD;
did almost every American who arrived; an&#xD;
repaired thither with Marie, greatly to our surprise, we&#xD;
found him on terms of intimacy with them, and appa-&#xD;
rently as much, at home as a member of the family.&#xD;
With what horror do I recall those people! for it was to&#xD;
their machinations, more than to all other causes com~&#xD;
bined, that Gustave owed his ruin and death; thaf Marie,:&#xD;
sank into an untimely grave; and that I am now an out-&#xD;
cast and a wanderer. It was there that the wine-cup was&#xD;
temptingly held out by female hands; it was there that&#xD;
the most brilliant 8aldn, which was no better than the&#xD;
lowest gambling-den in Paris, was presided over by fasci.&#xD;
noting women. Start not, for, as there ~s a God in heav-&#xD;
en, I speak but the truth. Monsieur iDuponte was whatI&#xD;
called a professional gambler; but the world (?) said ho&#xD;
was a very nice old gentleman, who enjoyed a quiet game&#xD;
at home, rather than seek it in haunts of vice.. That lie&#xD;
had his games at home, hundreds of agonized hearts can&#xD;
testify; and it makes the blood c~ir4le in my veins, to.&#xD;
think of the bright hopes that went down in midnight&#xD;
darkness around that board, until, ruined beyond redemp-&#xD;
tion, they died in some gutter, or filled a felon~~ grave.&#xD;
But weep for your sex-pray for your sex-when I tell&#xD;
you that that man's wife and only daughter were his&#xD;
ready. accomplices, his m6st fascinating assistants in hi~&#xD;
hellish schemes. From their lips Gustave heard that&#xD;
Marie's pure love was too exacting; and from them lie&#xD;
also learned that the restraints she would have thrown&#xD;

&#xD;
around him were a prisoner's chains, which would allow&#xD;
him no freedom or enjoyment. Occasionally, however,&#xD;
he would relent, and for days be the most constant and&#xD;
devoted lover. At such times Marie's face would beam&#xD;
with the radiant happiness she felt, as they talked of theli&#xD;
* far-off home and contemplated marriage. If we could&#xD;
have then withdrawn him from those evil associations, I&#xD;
firmly believe that, to-day, we might be a happy and&#xD;
united family, inst ~ad of two dead, and the other living a&#xD;
life of mysterious loneliness. But these seasons of ha~&#xD;
~iness were of short duration, and, the moment those&#xD;
female monsters would discover that Gustave had re~&#xD;
turned to his allegiance, they would put forth renewed&#xD;
efforts, and this infatuated boy would again fall a victim&#xD;
to their fiendish designs. i Their profession required that&#xD;
they should be well-read in the book of human nature;&#xD;
and comprehending from the first that I was no tool foi&#xD;
them, they left me alone. Not belonging to the set of&#xD;
fast men who made their house a rendezvous, and seeing&#xD;
very little of the family, ~it is not surprising that I was in&#xD;
almost total ignorance of what transpired beneath that&#xD;
roof. As for Marie-poor, deluded girl !-I verily be-&#xD;
lieve she would have gone to the brink of hell itself to&#xD;
have remained near Gustave; and so her lips were sealed,&#xD;
until it was too late. Thus three months passed misera-&#xD;
bly away, and the time drew near for us to turn our faces&#xD;
homeward. I still hoped and prayed that, for Marie's&#xD;
sake, his own honor, and the happiness of us all, Gustave&#xD;
would turn from the error of his way, and reform. But,&#xD;
alas! how idle were such hopes, the melancholy end ivill&#xD;
testify. All this time I walked as one in a dream-..~as a&#xD;
soixiflainbulist, who, having his eyes open, sees not; for I&#xD;
&#xD;
failed to notice the paling cheek and drooping forn of&#xD;
my preciouS sister, r the hectic flush that came and went,&#xD;
until the first h~merrhage filled me with horror. Neither&#xD;
did I know that Gustave was a bankrupt, until a letter'&#xD;
from our guardian informed me that he had honored hk&#xD;
drafts to the extent of his fortune. I cared nothing fo~&#xD;
this, as Marie and myself were both wealthy, and I&#xD;
thought perhaps an offer of a large sum might induce&#xD;
him to abandon his life of depravity, and tempt him tc&#xD;
return to the paths of virtue and rectitude. For a time&#xD;
my plan succeeded admhably, and my heart beat high&#xD;
with hope, when we arranged an early day on which to&#xD;
leave for home. But who can depict my despair, when Ii&#xD;
knew that the last dollar of the sum advanced had gone,&#xD;
like the rest, fbr gambling-debts and the most revolting&#xD;
debaucheries! I 110W determined to take Marie home,&#xD;
cost what it would. But no sooner had we decided to go,&#xD;
than the Dupontes declared their determination to follow&#xD;
suit. So, arriving at Ilavre together, we all took passage&#xD;
in the same vessel, and no words can describe the imupa-&#xD;
Pence I felt to reach my n~tiv~ land once more; for then&#xD;
I was resolved to break loose from our evil companions&#xD;
foi ever, and place Marie beyond the pale of their perse~&#xD;
cautions. The IDupontes, as well as Marie, were ignorant&#xD;
of Gustave's losses, and thd crafty mother and father had&#xD;
no idea of losing sight of one whom they expected to&#xD;
inveigle into a marriage with their daughter Elise.&#xD;
"Life on board ship was but a repetition of that in&#xD;
Paris; and, while Gustave was all attention to his new&#xD;
love, my poor sister drooped and faded, until it wrung my&#xD;
heart with agony to see her. A blow from th~ north-east&#xD;
gave her a severe cold and cough, and the ~eeond h~mor&#xD;

rhage ensued. The Madame and Elise were all kindness&#xD;
and attention-as well they might have been, for they&#xD;
were killing her. F or a day or two Gustave was all devo.&#xD;
tion, and Marie rallied so nuder these small crumbs from&#xD;
his traitorous hand that she was apparently well. She&#xD;
even allowed him to take her on deck, and declared that&#xD;
she never felt better. But Fate seemed inexorable, and&#xD;
when we reached New York, she seen'~ed more dead than&#xD;
alive.&#xD;
"Upon his return to America, Mr. Barri~re had settled&#xD;
in New York, leaving his partner in New Orleans; so&#xD;
that, upon our arrival, we were welcomed to his palatial&#xD;
residence on Madison Avenue, with the same cordiality&#xD;
as if we had been his own children. They supplied the&#xD;
places of the fondest parents to my darling sister, and&#xD;
everything was done for her that the warmest affection&#xD;
could suggest. Alas! she was to be a martyr to a false&#xD;
infatuation, and no love or skill could save her, for her&#xD;
days were numbered. Of course, I thought th? Dupontes&#xD;
would return to the Crescent City, and that we should~ be&#xD;
effectually rid of them; but, to my surprise and horror,&#xD;
they opened an establishment on Fifth Avenue, similar to~&#xD;
the one kept in Paris, which was frequented by fast me1~&#xD;
and women of doubtful reputation. Mr. Barri~re ~id&#xD;
myself made one last, final, effort to reclaim the erring&#xD;
one, and not without effect. Our kind guardian even&#xD;
touched upon a subject which I could not broach: it was&#xD;
my sister's declining health; and he asked him if he did&#xD;
not think his conduct heartless as well as dishonorable.&#xD;
The boy's heart was ever kind, and, being touched now if&#xD;
rear earnest, he pledged his sacred word and honor to&#xD;
break forever with his evil habits and associations, and&#xD;
&#xD;
A MIDNIGHT REVELATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
we had the indescribable pleasure of seeing him return&#xD;
to his first love-in gemuiuc penitence, as we thought.&#xD;
"The happiness of those days cannot be imagined, and&#xD;
Marie-poor, tender flower !-basked once more in the&#xD;
love and smiles of him who seemed indispensable to her&#xD;
being. She rallThd so as to be able to go out driving with&#xD;
him, and the ensuing month was replete with as pure and&#xD;
unalloyed bliss as ever falls to the lot bf mortals.&#xD;
"J~ust at this time it was currently reported that Gus-&#xD;
tave was soon to be married to Mademoiselle Elise Du~&#xD;
poute. I heard it, and, being asked several times if it.&#xD;
was true, of course indignantly denied such a charge.&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Barri~r~ gave themselves great concern&#xD;
about the report, and were pained lest it should reach&#xD;
Marie. Considering it one of those idle tales which&#xD;
readily find credence amongst a class whose sole aim in&#xD;
life is to detract from their fellow-men, IL gave it no atten~&#xD;
tion, or I should then and there have ferreted out the&#xD;
whole matter. Business connected with our estates call&#xD;
ing me to New Orleans, I went with the happiest heart I&#xD;
had knowii for many a day.&#xD;
"When kissing Marie 'good-by,' and confiding her to&#xD;
the care of Gustave, no misgivings entered my thoughts,&#xD;
for I expected to return at the expiration of a few weeks,&#xD;
and find him unchanged. But, alas!. to show what&#xD;
little confidence can be placed in human vows, within&#xD;
one brief hour after my departure, he returned, with&#xD;
a vigor which was increased by a short abstinence, to&#xD;
his old haunts and habits. Three days elapsed, ~aud&#xD;
Marie saw him not; then six went by; then ten-and&#xD;
still he came not. The intense anxiety and excitement&#xD;
caused by this cruel suspense brought on h~en2iorrhage&#xD;

regard to his approaching marriage with. Miss iDuponte,&#xD;
and the kind public even went so far as to name an early&#xD;
day for the nuptials.&#xD;
"Throuo'hthegossipping tongues of malicious friends Q~&#xD;
and servants, these reports reached Marie, and when Gus-&#xD;
tave came not, her life was jeopardized by the torture&#xD;
which racked her heart. An unexpected telegram brought&#xD;
me quickly back but to clasp her in my arms once more&#xD;
-but once again to 'kiss those lips which were soon cold&#xD;
and #silent in death. Her last words were, 'Brother---&#xD;

nearer-Gustave!' and with superhuman strength she&#xD;
Bat upright, and gazed wildly around the room. But the&#xD;
loved one greeted not the vacant stare which sought him,&#xD;
neither did he hear the dying accents which lisped his&#xD;
name,. for he was donning his wedding-suit. A death-&#xD;
groan was the only evidence we had of her disappoint-&#xD;
ment; and, as she fell back in exhaustion, a stream of&#xD;
fresh blood gurgled forth which drenched us both. The&#xD;
struggle was then soon over, for, without a murmur, she&#xD;
breathed her last as I bent anxiously over her."&#xD;
OveWbwered by harrowing memories, D'Estaing was&#xD;
forced to stop here, and, burying his face in his hands, lie&#xD;
wept as bitter tears as ever caine from human eyes.. 1-us&#xD;
whole being throb bed painfully; and Maud's tears&#xD;
flowed, too, for . this sister in sorrow, who loved "not&#xD;
wisely, but too well."&#xD;
Their low sobs filled the room, and some little time&#xD;
elapsed, when, turning to Maud, ID'Estaing said ex&#xD;
citodly:&#xD;
&#xD;
A MIDNIGHT REVELATION.       i8~&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do you wonder that I left the house a madman, and&#xD;
that revenge had taken possession of me, heart, minds&#xD;
and soul? I entered in that house a loving brother; I~&#xD;
caine out of it a fiend.&#xD;
"But time was precious, for the villain, was to b~ mar~&#xD;

ing my murdered angel a thousand farewells, V flew,&#xD;
rather than walked, along the streets, for 'l4iad a long&#xD;
account to settle with this worse than Cain, and I felt as&#xD;
if II should die unless it were done speedily. It was a fit&#xD;
night-was it not ?-to avenge the death of his murdered&#xD;
bride. I sought him at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, where&#xD;
he had lived since his desertion of us, but was informed&#xD;
that he had just gone with his bridal party to the Thi-&#xD;
pontes. 'Then the rumor is true,' I said, for until that&#xD;
moment I had not believed it; and as I turned hastily&#xD;
away, I wondered that tlNwrath of God did not strike&#xD;
him dead. It was but a short distance to the residence~&#xD;
of the Dupontes, and rushing madly along the street, I&#xD;
soon gained the desired haven. The house was brUliantl~&#xD;
illuminated, and the street was almost entirely blockaded&#xD;
with equipages; but darting through the crowded way, I '~&#xD;
soon gained the entrance, where the merry voices and gay&#xD;
laughter within grated hamhly upon my bleeding heart.&#xD;
The service was to take place at the famous cathedral in&#xD;
Twenty-eighth street; and while I stood as one palsied,&#xD;
with no del4ied plan in my mind, two or three of the&#xD;
bridal couples passed out and sought their respective car-&#xD;
riages. At length the object of my search made his&#xD;
appearance, when, quick as lightning, I sprang from my&#xD;
hiding-place, seized him by the throat, draggo4 him fx'o*n&#xD;

the hilt into his very heart, saying, as I did so, 'Take&#xD;
this-and this-and this-for your treachery to Marie&#xD;
Delamere; and know, before you die, that it is her&#xD;
brother who thus avenges her wrongs!'&#xD;
"it is astonishing how effective an arm can bo when&#xD;
nerved by such a cause as mine, for I must have dealt&#xD;
him a dozen blows before any one seemed to realize the&#xD;
~ituatioII, or before any attempt was made to stay me in&#xD;
my work of death. Suddenly my arm was seized, the&#xD;
weapon was wrenched from my hand, and, as I released&#xD;
the victim of my revenge, I had the satisfaction of see-&#xD;
ing him fall dead at my feet. No groan or word escaped&#xD;
him, and I wished then, and have wished ever since, that&#xD;
I could there have expiated the deed by death at the&#xD;
hands ~f the infuriated mob, who called loudly for&#xD;
revenge. The scene that ensued can never be described,&#xD;
and those only can have any conception of it who were&#xD;
eye-witnesses. In the terrible confusion, some cried&#xD;
'Murder!~ while others were paralyzed into silence.&#xD;
The police seemed under a spell, which withheld them in&#xD;
the performance of their duty;* women shrieked; the&#xD;
bride fainted,, and fell upon the dead body of the groom,&#xD;
and it seemed to me but a just retribution, when I beheld&#xD;
her wedding-robes bedabbledx in the blood of my sister's&#xD;
r~iurderer. The warm crimson stream ran at my feet,&#xD;
and, looking at it, I felt somewhat avenged, as I remem-&#xD;
bered it was 'blood for blood.'&#xD;
"The police then approaching, I gave myself up&#xD;
instantly, thus obviating the necessity of using any force.&#xD;
But the set of fast young men who composed the bridal&#xD;
party, being doubly maddened by the death of thefr&#xD;
thief, as well as cheated out of a night's debauch, now&#xD;
&#xD;
0&#xD;
&#xD;
sought revenge in return. Collecting a mob with the&#xD;
determination of hanging me, they followed us to the&#xD;
jail, with cries of 'Mob him! Shoot him! ilang him!'&#xD;
But not one of them being bold enough to take the lead,&#xD;
their suggestions were not put into execution, an~l they&#xD;
only succeeded in firing a few random shots, and throw-&#xD;
ilig stoAes at me. how little did I heed the~m or their&#xD;
threats! The only two who made life worth the living&#xD;
were dead, and such a death, as made me wish I too was&#xD;
of their silent number.&#xD;
"We had now reached the gloomy portals of tlie&#xD;
'Tombs,' and it was with great difficulty that the police&#xD;
could force an entrance, for the mob pressed right and&#xD;
left. But at length I wa~ alone in my cell; and as the&#xD;
heavy door banged to, I fell upon the~ cot in utter eihaus-&#xD;
tion and wretchedness, and perfect i:idifference as to the&#xD;
consequences. The yells of the rioters outside fell un~&#xD;
heeded, for a stupor had crept over me, which the sight&#xD;
of even a scaffold could not have shaken off. Several&#xD;
hours went by unnoticed. The moi outside had slunk~&#xD;
away one by one, and comparative quiet was noW re-&#xD;
stored. Suddenly the door of my cell creaked on. its&#xD;
hiwres, and the next i~ioment my kind guardian said,&#xD;
"'My God! Alphonse, why have you done this?'&#xD;
"I did not answer him, but pressed his hand in silence.&#xD;
"'What a~night of horror is this!' he shuddered and&#xD;
said, as he embraced me and burst into tears. Then&#xD;
springing up, he said, in an excited whisper,&#xD;
"'But there is no time to be lost. Take this hat alid&#xD;

"'Never!' I said, throwing the hat and cloak from&#xD;
me. 'Whathaveltolivefor?'&#xD;
"'Do not talk so, Alphonse!' he said. 'I fear there&#xD;
could not be a jury iinpanelled that would not convict&#xD;
you; and it would kill my wife and myself to see you&#xD;

If you have no regard for yourself, fly 'for the sake of&#xD;

"'And leave you here!' I said,&#xD;
"'Oh,~ they will not trouble an old man like me!' he&#xD;
said. 'Go-go, I implore you, Alphonse, before it is too&#xD;
late?'&#xD;
"I hesitated for some time, and then, from the depths&#xD;
of the painful silence which was upon us, I said, in a&#xD;
voice which was choked with tears:&#xD;
"'For your sake, and hers, who has been a mother to&#xD;
me, I go. Remember, it is not because I value life, but&#xD;
to spare the feelings of you and her.'&#xD;
"lIe folded me in his arms as a mother might an&#xD;
infant, and the tears rained down our cheeks. No word&#xD;
escaped our lips, for our hearts were too full, and our&#xD;
farewdl was silent. I passed the turnkey and the guard&#xD;
without any difficulty, and, rushing along the streets like&#xD;
some 'escaped convict who prizes his miserable life, at last&#xD;
arrived at the spot designated by my kind guardian. The&#xD;
man and boat were both ready and. waiting; the wind&#xD;
was favorable, and, sinking upon the miniature deck, I&#xD;
bade him begone, and soon we ~ia~d left New York far&#xD;
behind us. My heart was bkeding at every core. I'&#xD;
could not talk to my dusky companion, and after a quick&#xD;
&#xD;
A MIDNIGHT REVELATION.&#xD;

&#xD;
sail we landed at Nassau, without having exchanged a&#xD;
dozen words. It was here that I took the nan~e of D'Es~&#xD;
taing, for my real name is Delainere; and after coinmu~&#xD;
nicating with Mr. Barri~re, and receiving remittances in&#xD;
this feigned name, I went directly to Cuba. From there&#xD;
I went to 'Spain; then to the East, where I met your&#xD;
friend Moreau. Growing wear there, as everywhere, I&#xD;
came to the Continent. Here, as elsewhere, everything&#xD;
palled upon me. I was a stranger in a strange land; and&#xD;
thus five years passed wretchedly away. A great 'longing&#xD;
for the 'Sunny South' came over me. I could not resist&#xD;
it; and, crossing the 'deep, blue ocean,' the fugitive'&#xD;
from justice rested from his lonely wanderings, and made&#xD;
his home in your midst.&#xD;
"Thus I have given y~u a brief outline of my history.,&#xD;
Since my arrival here, you know what my life has been,&#xD;
for you have awakened those feelings which I thought&#xD;
would never exist for me. You have turned the bright&#xD;
page of my life outside, and made me wish to live. Now&#xD;
that you know all, tell me if you can tal~e theso hands,&#xD;
which are dyed with a brother's blood, in yours?"&#xD;
Pressing them warmly, she looked the "yes" which&#xD;
her lips refused to speak.&#xD;
"And you can love me?" he asked, anxiously, while&#xD;
gazing into her face.&#xD;
11cr glorious eyes made answer, as in one burning&#xD;
glance she betrayed the intense love which filled her&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
"And you are to be mine?" he whispered, as lie&#xD;
pressed her to his heart and kissed her brow.&#xD;
"Come, darling I If you love me, fly with me, ere it&#xD;
is too late!"&#xD;

At these words she drew away from him, and said,&#xD;
"I must not listen to such language."&#xD;
"May I not even hope that in the future you will be&#xD;
mine ? "&#xD;
"No-never!"&#xD;
There was a mingling of pain with love in both hearts&#xD;
at that moment; and as the clock told tWo, he arose,&#xD;
and, pressing her to his heart once more, ~vent out into&#xD;
the night; while she sank down upon th&amp;amp; tUe-d -tUe in&#xD;
untold misery.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
~~LEAF BY LEAF THE ROSES&#xD;
IROWNED! Who's drowned?" And thus&#xD;
the question flew from lip to lip, and loving&#xD;
hearts stood still, and rosy cheeks grew pale,&#xD;
and stalwart forms were shaken, and maiden eyes. were&#xD;
tearful, as each thought on the, one best beloved. Only a&#xD;
few days before, Fred West had called upon Maud to say&#xD;
"good-by," and had offered to be the bearer of messages&#xD;
or letters to the absent ones, whom he expected to join at&#xD;
the fashionable sea-side resort of Long Branch. A week&#xD;
lhter, as he stepped from the omnibus of the West End&#xD;
hotel, he was startled by the "hurrying to and fro," and&#xD;
th~ pallid chee~is of those he met, by the shrieks of&#xD;
women borne to him on the passing wind, and with one&#xD;
bound he sprang into the office of the hotel, and inquired'&#xD;
for Miss Dean.. Upon being informed that she had gone&#xD;
&#xD;
[&#xD;
&#xD;
out bathing with a party of friends, his heart stood still&#xD;
with fear; but that fear lent speed to his limbs, and with,&#xD;
marvellous rapidity he gained the beach, where a large&#xD;
crowd had already gathered. As he drew nearer, one&#xD;
long, loud shriek pierced his heart, and the well-known&#xD;
voice of Kate called to him, saying: "Oh, Fred! Daisy&#xD;
-Daisy! Quick! quick, or it will be too late! Here-&#xD;
here!" And, dragging him to the spot where they had&#xD;
gone in bathing, she pointed in the direction where they&#xD;
had lost sight of Daisy, and where there were already a&#xD;
number of gallant men struggling with the waves in&#xD;
hopes of finding the lost form. Fred, who was an expert&#xD;
swimmer, soon outstripped them all; and if the silent&#xD;
prayer which went up from his distracted heart could&#xD;
have been framed into words, it would have been, "My&#xD;
God, give me strength!'? Ere long, Daisy's gallant&#xD;
champions returned pne by one to the sea-girt strand, and&#xD;
a quiet shake of the head expressed more deeply than&#xD;
words the despair that reigned in their hearts. One form&#xD;
was still seen contending, although occasionally lost sight.&#xD;
of as the foam-crested waves swept over him. Each&#xD;
moment the breakers grew stronger and more frequent,&#xD;
and superhuman strength alone gould have resisted the&#xD;
fearful under-tow, which in its treachery had borne Daisy&#xD;
away, as, for a moment, she relinquished her* pon&#xD;
the rope.&#xD;
Amongst the lookers-on who stood watching the tern.&#xD;
ble struggle between the boyish lover and the boiling,&#xD;
seething cauldron of that wide waste of waters, were&#xD;
moist eyes and hearts that were throbbing with truest&#xD;
syn~pathy. But alas! it was hoping against hope, and he~.&#xD;
was fast expending his own life in what appeared to be a&#xD;

fruitless search. Determined to go down with the an gel&#xD;
of his life, or else to rescue her lovely form from its briny&#xD;
grave, he defied the waves, which were becoming terribly&#xD;
strong as they rolled in a resistless tide to the shore. ill is&#xD;
herculean efforts were exhausting him, and his strength&#xD;
was failing no less rapidly than his heart was sinkhig&#xD;
with disappointment and despair. lie was afar out froii&#xD;
the stakes, and was swimming and diving between the&#xD;
ropes, when suddenly Kate's quick eye caught a glimpse,&#xD;
of something which grew larger and more defined, as she&#xD;
screamed, "Fred,! here-quick!" From her prostrate&#xD;
position upon the beach, where she knelt and prayed and&#xD;
wept, she discovered Daisy's golden locks floating upon&#xD;
the water, and a nearer sight exposed a face white as&#xD;
marble, and a form enrobed in a blue bathing-suit. Sev-&#xD;
eral gentlemen then plunged in again and swain to the&#xD;
rescue; but, true in death as in life, the pulseless and ~&#xD;
insensible, body floated almost into the arms of its lover;&#xD;
and poor Fred, exhausted and fainting, gained the shore,&#xD;
and laid his "beauteous bride" at Kate's feet. Every&#xD;
restorative was applied, but in vain, for her 'soul had&#xD;
winged its flight to that God from whom tt came.&#xD;
Laying there dead, in all her youth and beauty, stony&#xD;
indeed must have been the heart that could have listened&#xD;
unmoved to the lamentations of the bereaved lover:&#xD;
"Not dead-oh, no! no! no! Daisy, my own darling&#xD;
open your blue eyes, if but once only, to look upon your&#xD;
lover, where he kneels in his anguish! Come back, 'i~y&#xD;
angel-my pet! And such a death! To think how&#xD;
fondly 1 would~ have folde&amp;amp; you to this heart, whose&#xD;
every throb is yours! But, instead of my caresses, the&#xD;
greedy waves Jashed you in their fury, while the briny&#xD;
&#xD;
waterS pressed those lips which my kisses should have&#xD;
covered!"&#xD;
Soon they bore her to the hotel, and throughout the&#xD;
long, lonely watches of that night his incoherent plead-&#xD;
ings never ceased. The dance-hall was deserted; no&#xD;
muSic was -..heard, and the gay laugh and idle jest were&#xD;
hushed. A cloud rested upon friend and stranger, and&#xD;
~neither {ime nor distance will ever obliterate the memory&#xD;
of this heart-rending occurrence. Maud had been ap-&#xD;
prised of it by telegram, and a torrent of bitter tears&#xD;
flowed for this faultless creature whom she loved so&#xD;
dearly. Both Ruth and Mr. D'Estaing shared her grief,&#xD;
as did the entire community; for Daisy had no enemies,&#xD;
and it might have been truly said,&#xD;
"None knew her but to love her,&#xD;
None named her but to praise."&#xD;
Thus "leaf by leaf the roses began to fall," and Maud.&#xD;
shuddered as she wondered who would be the next victim&#xD;
in the gay Ictrterre. Was the hand of sorrow to be&#xD;
stretched over them all, one by one, until none should&#xD;
remain without a blight .~&#xD;

A few days later, Christ Church, in Savannah, was&#xD;
filled to overflowing with the good and the true, all of&#xD;
whom seemed eager to pay the last sad tribute to one of&#xD;
earth's fairest flowers. In the midst of the solemnity&#xD;
that reigned, ~ lovely soprano voice sang pleadingly and&#xD;
willingly, "The Reaper and the Flowers." It touched&#xD;
the sympathetic chord in every heart there assembled,&#xD;
and low sobs filled the iloly temple.&#xD;
Amongst the chief mourners are a well-known trio;&#xD;

but Fred sheds no tears, as he sits with bowed head and&#xD;
bleeding heart; and, shuddering at Kate's excessive grief,&#xD;
Maud wonders if she can be the same hoyden of other&#xD;
days.&#xD;
Service concluded, the flower-decked coffin was borne&#xD;
from the church by loving hands, and the funeral train&#xD;
moved sadly and slowly in the direction of Buonaven-&#xD;
ture, that silent, weird, melancholy city of the dead.&#xD;
The grave was already 'yawning and waiting to. receive&#xD;
its beautiful treasure; and as the coffin was lowered, and&#xD;
some clods of earth thrown in upon it, these words~ of&#xD;
truth fell upon the bursting hearts of the bystanders, and&#xD;
made solemnity more solejjnn:&#xD;
"Man that is born of a woman has but a short time to&#xD;
live, and is full of misery. He comet up, and is cut&#xD;
down like a flower; he fleet as it were a shadow, and&#xD;
never continued in one stay. In the midst of life we are&#xD;
in death. Of whom may we seek for succor but of&#xD;
Thee, 0 Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased?"&#xD;
etc.&#xD;
At length the voice ceased; the grave that stood open&#xD;
was filled, and all had left but Fred, who threw himself&#xD;
in an abandon of~ grief upon the mound which held his&#xD;
life, his love.&#xD;
The wind was sighing through the long moss; the sun&#xD;
was low adown the sky; the shadows were lengthening&#xD;
over "ghoul-haunted woodland of ~Weir," and Fred&#xD;
crouched still lower in the darkness, and wept his "lost&#xD;
Uhdiime."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
A LOYER~ 5 QUARREL.&#xD;
ATE, your conduct is sadly changed towards&#xD;
me of late," said Harry Fielder, a few even-&#xD;
ings after the funeral.&#xD;
"And I an~ sadly changed," answered this capricious&#xD;
creature, as, seating herself by the centre-table, she buried&#xD;
her face in both hands, and heaved a deep sigh. A&#xD;
pretty picture she made, in her long, sowing robes of&#xD;
Qbombazine and crape, which she wore in memory of~&#xD;
Daisy.&#xD;
"And wha4 troubles my darling?" asked Harry in a&#xD;
tone of tenderness, as he seated himself very near her.&#xD;
"Oh, nothing-ev~rything!" w~s the impatient reply,&#xD;
as she pushed her chair back.&#xD;
"And why am I not to come near you, Kate?" was&#xD;
asked in a tone that betrayed only too well how deeply&#xD;
wounded the speaker felt.&#xD;
"Because I do not desire it," was the reply, as she sat&#xD;
breaking to pieces, in "wilful waste," an exquisite ivory&#xD;
fan which was a gift from Harry.&#xD;
"That surely is the best of reasons." And, slightly&#xD;
piqued, he moved his chair on the opposite side of the&#xD;
table, and regarded his wayward love.&#xD;
Kate did not look up, but toyed with the fan, and for&#xD;
once seemed subdued.&#xD;
One of the saddest things in life is the contemplation&#xD;
of the change that must and will surely come to such&#xD;
temperaments as Kate's. The stages of such a woman's&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC8258-00000098"/>&#xD;
life are very nice1~ comprehended by the French, who&#xD;
speak of them as "prude, coquette, devotee" Or is the&#xD;
reason to be found in the fact, that a certain amount of&#xD;
vitality being given to every one, and Kate, having ox-&#xD;
p~nded so much of herb, had grown prematurely old,&#xD;
while yet in the flush of youth? Whatever the case may&#xD;
or may not be, it was quite certain that that quiet or mob&#xD;
ancholy that comes to such natures had fallen upon her&#xD;
now, and she would never be the same, again. Like&#xD;
"Lucile," she might truly have exclaimed, "1 am xveai~y;&#xD;
I would rest."&#xD;
The silence was fast becoming unendurable, but neither&#xD;
one seemed disposed to break it. At length harry said:&#xD;
"Kate, you promised to appoint a day for our marriage&#xD;
npon your return."&#xD;
"I always make it a rule to forget all my promises;&#xD;
then I am not comp~1ed to fulfil them," was the provok-&#xD;
ilig reply.&#xD;
"Then it is your intention not to comply with your&#xD;
word? "-*and his voice trembled with emotion.&#xD;
With lips slightly curled, she said,&#xD;
'~ I did not say that this was to be the exception to the&#xD;
rule."&#xD;
"Oh, Kate!" was the exclamation; arid the' anguish&#xD;
and despair that was expressed in those two words would&#xD;
have wrung mercy and pity from any heart save that of&#xD;
*a capricious woman, whose chief delight is to toy and&#xD;
trifle with the deep devotiofr of some true and honest&#xD;
man. Ten to one, she discards that sincere love for the&#xD;
fulsome flattery of some polished rou~. Can any one&#xD;
explaiii why it is that both men and women so often&#xD;
Wound -most deeply those hearts which are nearest' &amp;amp;nd&#xD;
&#xD;
dearest, while taking especial pains to be khd and tender&#xD;
with the feelings of those who are nothing to them? ills&#xD;
it a refined torture that the perversity of humaft nature&#xD;
spontaneously and gratuitoi~ly prepares for its victims?&#xD;
Is it the modern rack which lovers institute and married&#xD;
people perpetuate?&#xD;
But Kate proceeds with her inquisition, as she answers&#xD;
his "Oh, Kate!" with "Well, Harry!" and her tone&#xD;
was as cold and indifferent as the veriest stranger could&#xD;
have been greeted with.&#xD;
"Kate, you no longer love me!" And he leaned for-&#xD;
ward and bent on her a searching look, as if he would&#xD;
penetrate to the depths of her heart, and read therein his&#xD;
fate.&#xD;
"I never told you that ill did-eh, Harry?" was the&#xD;
heartless rejoinder.&#xD;
"No, not in so many words.'~ And, being fully&#xD;
aroused, he now determined to resist all future taunts.&#xD;
"But you have given me to understand that you did,&#xD;
by all your 'actions, which speak louder than words '-&#xD;
by voluntarily Feceiving my undivided attentions-and,&#xD;
lastly, by engaging yourself to me. You are your own&#xD;
mistress, Kate, and entirely too independent to be influ-&#xD;
enced or directed by even the best of friends to enter&#xD;
into any compact~ that did not suit your fancy. A~ these&#xD;
circumstances led me to hope-aye, to believe-that you&#xD;
returned in some degree the love of a heart whose every&#xD;
throb is yours.. A few short month&amp;amp; ago we were happy&#xD;

"You speak altogether in the past tense, Harry," was&#xD;
the heartless reply to this outburst of passion.&#xD;

happiness once beamed, I now see discontent; where I&#xD;
thought ,there was love, I now behold indifference. Tell&#xD;
-I&#xD;
me, Kate, if these are only the wild imaginings of a&#xD;
heart that is jealous of your slightest word ?-or do you&#xD;
love me still? Tell me, I implore you!" ~ And he knelt&#xD;
at her feet.&#xD;
But no word escaped the lips of that strange being to&#xD;
quiet the fears of her honest and devoted lover, as he&#xD;
knelt pleading at her side Turning indifferently away,&#xD;
and resting her eIb9 on the table, she leaned her head&#xD;
on her hand, and thus silently rejected that love, that&#xD;
happiness, which was within her grasp, as only women&#xD;
recklessly can throw away the few pearls which are scat~&#xD;
tered on their pathway..&#xD;
Is there some angel .in disguise that withholds those&#xD;
blessings which would make this "earth an Eden," and&#xD;
allows men to follow the dictates of their restless hearts,&#xD;
until, weary and satiated, they ~cry out in their agony,&#xD;
"Peace! peace I Where can peace ~be found?"&#xD;
Turning to TIarl7 and extendingg her hand, which he&#xD;
kissed most fervently, she said,&#xD;
"Arise, Harry!' I would not have you kneel; and it&#xD;
pains me to tell you Ahow change~ I am."&#xD;
~ITer tone was sad and her Wh~&amp;amp;e manner subdued; but&#xD;
/ IJiarry noticed nothing, as he said, efcitedly,&#xD;
&#xD;
Changed!"&#xD;
"Yes-changed, harry! Not toward you I)~~'tidnlarly,&#xD;
but towards everything and everybody. Life is no longer&#xD;
the bright butterfly which I chased a year ago; but all&#xD;
things seem clouded, and I find myself continually sigh.&#xD;
mo' and weeping."&#xD;
"Do not talk so, Kate! It is only the late sad ~ocdur~&#xD;
rence that makes you feel so depressed. I trust that&#xD;
Time will heal the wound and bring oblivion to your sem&#xD;
sitive heart."&#xD;
Sighing, and shaking her head sadly, she said,&#xD;
"No. I shall never be the same again."&#xD;
How truly she spoke, the future will disclose.&#xD;
"No, never the same to me!" said harry, in the mos~&#xD;
excited manner ~ and, as a streak of jealousy shot through&#xD;
his heart, he added, hastily: "For to another is giv~r~&#xD;
that love that was mine. Another and only one, can call&#xD;
the smile to your lip, can bring jo~o yo'tir heart, or make&#xD;
life the same. Is it not so? Are not the words I speak&#xD;
true? Answer me!" And his quivering lips and flash.&#xD;
ing eyes rather commanded than asked a reply.&#xD;
Kate, who a moment before had been all kindness in&#xD;
endeavoring to break as gently as possible the r6al feek&#xD;
ings of her heart to Harfy, now no longer cared,, and,&#xD;
rather glad of an excuse to release herself from a boi~d-&#xD;
age which was becoming galling,~said, haughtily and ~defi~&#xD;
antly,&#xD;
"Granting your words to be true, Mr. Fielder, I do not&#xD;
acknowledge the authority which you presume to take."&#xD;
"I claim the ~uthority which niy deep devotion, my&#xD;
honorable wooing, an~ur engage~nent give. me."&#xD;
"That engagement is at an end from (his moment,",&#xD;

&#xD;
said Kate, angrily; and, taking from her fingers a spark~&#xD;
hug diamond, she handed it to him, saying, "Hero is the&#xD;
pledge of it."&#xD;
Taking it, he tossed it across the room, saying, as he&#xD;
did so,&#xD;
"Away with such baubles-such pledges!" and then&#xD;
very sarcastically added, "I presume the solitaire upon&#xD;
your first finger is the gift of that strolling vagabond,&#xD;
Guy Witherell. I must congratulate you upon its rare&#xD;
brilliance!"&#xD;
"Mr. Fielder," said Kate, whose cheeks were crimson&#xD;
with the indignation she felt, "Mr. Witherell is a friend&#xD;
of mine, and I will not hear him spoken of in such dP~.&#xD;
respectful terms."&#xD;
But Harry, nothing daunted, continued by saying:&#xD;
"I presume he purchases his diamonds with the same&#xD;
invisiblee means' by which he lives. I congratulate you&#xD;
both upon the posses#uui of such an inexhaustible for.&#xD;
tune. His love is to be very much prized, because ho&#xD;
lavishes it only upon those whom he can use. I wish you&#xD;
much joy of your new lover."&#xD;
As she arose to her feet, 4~e said,&#xD;
"Mr. Fielder, it is best that the conversation, already&#xD;
COQ prolonged, should end." And, walking to the door,&#xD;
she said, with trembling voice and flashing eye, "I wish&#xD;
yori good-night."&#xD;
her slow and stately step resounded along the hall,&#xD;
and, ascending the stairway, she reached her chamber but&#xD;
to cast herself in an agony of tears upon her sleepless&#xD;
couch.&#xD;
Some little time elapsed before harry sufficiently re&#xD;
covered himself to comprehend wh~t had occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
H4XKE~ SWEET&#xD;

&#xD;
Then, as one in a dream, he left the house, and not caring&#xD;
whither he went, wended his footsteps slowly in the direc&#xD;
tion of that lovely spot, Forsyth Place, leaned on the rail-&#xD;
lug, and gazed at the fountain. But it was a vacant stare,&#xD;
and he saw not how the moonbeams shimmered upon the&#xD;
water; he was not aware that the lovely flowers around&#xD;
that fountain exhaled the sweetest perfume; he 'did not&#xD;
see the twinkling stars laughing at each other, and all the&#xD;
beauties which had been gathered there by artistic hands&#xD;
were lost upon him.&#xD;

ago; and so sing I to-night," said Colonel&#xD;
Ilartridge, as he joined Maud on the gallery, late one&#xD;
evening. "Is it not strange that he could write so feel-&#xD;
ingly of what he never enjoyed ?-for, as you know, lxe&#xD;
was a Wanderer, and had no home."&#xD;
"We never fully appreciate the blessings which are&#xD;
ours," replied Maud. "I dare say, if ~Payne had pos-&#xD;
sessed the 'home' of which he sang, 4e worldd would&#xD;
have been minus his beautiful poem. UuxJ~ortunat~iy, our&#xD;
happiness seems never to consist in what w~&amp;amp;h~ye, but in&#xD;
the contemplation of imaginary things."&#xD;
"I am sorry to hear you say this, Maud," replied her&#xD;

"Oh, Id~ not speak of myself particularly," she cried&#xD;
"buf of :tho world in general."&#xD;
"TWat's better," said Colonel llartridge.&#xD;
j'You are a rare exception to the rule," she continued,&#xD;
Stand find happiness in those things which you possess.&#xD;
tThe secret of it must be found in that old couplet, which&#xD;
&#xD;
says,&#xD;
$&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Contentment gives a crown,&#xD;
Where fortune bath 'denied it."'&#xD;
&#xD;
"True, it is only one's self, after all. The heart must&#xD;
possess the charm of contentment and then there may be&#xD;
happiness."&#xD;
At these words, Maud's conscience pierced her with an&#xD;
accusing .sting. Then, looking long and peeringly into&#xD;
the shadowy twilight, she shuddered to think how her&#xD;
husband would be dismayed could he but get a single&#xD;
glimpse into her restless, wayward heart; and in a&#xD;
kind of soliloquy,' and more to herself than to him, she&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"If "tis home wherever the heart is,' what singular&#xD;
abodes hearts must take to themselves! And, to trans~&#xD;
pose Shakespeare, that would be giving 'a local habita-&#xD;
tion'to 'airy nothings.'"&#xD;
You surely do not call hearts 'airy' nothings'?" said&#xD;
Colonel .Ilartridge, mockingly.&#xD;
"Only figuratively," she sighed.&#xD;
"Without changing the subject, Ntaud, I cannot tell&#xD;
you how happy I am to be at home once more, and above&#xD;
ollto see you so much improved!"&#xD;
"I believe I am in better health than w~ien you left,&#xD;
althoughh I feel very listless at times, and dreadfully de&#xD;
pressed."&#xD;
&#xD;
C'HOME, SWEET HOME!,,          208&#xD;
"You must cheer up, and be gay like your old self.&#xD;
and not move around so ghost-like," said he, tenderly.&#xD;
As if she could be gay with such a weight of love and&#xD;
despair dangling at~ her heart-strings!&#xD;
Although his words were faultlessly conventional,~ no&#xD;
warm kiss or gentle embrace accompanied them; 'and&#xD;
he sat at a distance, as cold and undemonstrative as an&#xD;
iceberg. Thus it ever was. His love, that Maud had no&#xD;
cause to doubt, was most generally left to be instinctively J&#xD;
felt or passively inferred; it was never demonstrated.&#xD;
In the meantime, her ~oul was hungry for the all-&#xD;
absorbing devotion that the exacting heart of woman J&#xD;
demands, and without which her life, at best, is empty,&#xD;
and devoid of interest. (Why will men never under~&#xD;
stand that it is the little things of life which make&#xD;
women happy? A caress, a kiss at parting and return~&#xD;
ing, a flower brought or sent, a shawl folded lovii~gly&#xD;
about her shoulders-indeed, any trifling attention whidi&#xD;
silently tells her she is remembered. But love must be~&#xD;
demonstrated, just as if it were some abstruse Sciefloer ~&#xD;
and not left to be imagined. And in like manner must \ ~.,&#xD;
it be fed. J Do not all flames become extingushed,~ud&#xD;

Both. Colonel Hartridge and ~Eaud had fallen into a&#xD;
reverie, which was finally broken by him:&#xD;
"Maud, D'Estaing will be here this evening to tea&#xD;
and I am really very glad, for I have not had a long t~k&#xD;
with him since ruy return."&#xD;
With these words he entered the hall, and Maud. ~&#xD;

&#xD;
coming? or is there an invisible electric wire that corn-&#xD;
7 municates with and sends a thrill of ecstatic joy bound-&#xD;
ing from one heart to another?&#xD;
A moment before, Maud fancied a shapeless shadow&#xD;
stood' behind the Pulaski monument; but as it advanced&#xD;
nearer and nearer, the well-known proportions of the suN&#xD;
ject of her thoughts were clearly defined, and in another&#xD;
instant, standing by her side, he pressed her hand, and&#xD;
whispered,&#xD;
"Dearest!"&#xD;
Her lips had always refused to greet her idol of flesh&#xD;
and blood with the cold conventionalities which society&#xD;
demanded, and which were addressed to others, so she&#xD;
was silent, and pointed him to a seat.&#xD;
"Have we not time for a stroll in the park?" said&#xD;
he.&#xD;
"I suppose so," she answered.&#xD;
"Comethen;Imust speak to you to-night, or I shall&#xD;
die!"&#xD;
Without another word, they descended the steps and&#xD;
walked slowly by in the shadow of the monument, which&#xD;
is at once a source of pride and an honor to Savannah, to&#xD;
that lovely park almost um'ivalled in its simple yet lush&#xD;
beauty.&#xD;
The street was thronged with gay promenades return-&#xD;
inghonie, and the park ..was comparatively deserted, for&#xD;
evening was gathering thickly her purple ~hades over the&#xD;
twilight landscape. The careless jest and light laugh of&#xD;
the passers-by fell heavily over the hearts of Maud and&#xD;
D'Estaing, for they were both wretched and silent. After&#xD;
trollingg around for some little while and remarking 111)011&#xD;
the beauty of the fountain, they seated theniseWes in a&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
~UOME, SWEET hOME!"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
retired spot, where they were free from intrusion and&#xD;
interruption..&#xD;
"It seems like a century since I saw you last," said&#xD;
Maud.&#xD;
"It seems like two centuries to me," replied D'Estaing,&#xD;
gazing by the gas-lamp into her glorious eyes. "But tell&#xD;
me, Maud, are you now ready to give me the proof of&#xD;
your love for which I have so long pleaded?"&#xD;
"What fresh proof do you desire?"&#xD;
"Will you fly with me?"&#xD;
his voice trembled from excitement, and' his whole&#xD;
frame was shaken by the emotion which thrilled, him.&#xD;
heaven only knows how, in that hour, she was tempted&#xD;
to say "Yes!" and what a struggle it eost her not to&#xD;
accede to his request. Her tongue was bridled, but a&#xD;
whirlpool was raging in her breast, and her brain was on&#xD;
fire.&#xD;
D'Estaing bent over her, until his breath, like the gasp&#xD;
of a dying man, fanned her cheek. They were face to&#xD;
face, if not heart to heart, and in the darkness he pressed&#xD;
her hand until she could have cried with pain, but no&#xD;
word escaped her lips.&#xD;
"Will you fly with me?" he repeated again and&#xD;
again.&#xD;
how temptingly did love and pleasure beckon~ her to~&#xD;
an untried Eden! And, as if viewing with each other&#xD;
they both attempted to silence her conscience, and steep&#xD;
it in those oblivious draughts which make a crimfue a vir-&#xD;
tue. But the shadow of duty loomed up before her, and,&#xD;
submitting not to her inclinations, but 'the law which&#xD;
hound her to another, .she forced herself to say,&#xD;
"Never!"&#xD;

&#xD;
Dashing her hand from him in all the fury of di8ap.&#xD;
pointed love, he said, in a tone of bitterness,&#xD;
"Then you do not love me!"&#xD;
"Do not love you!" she thought to herself. "I would&#xD;
to'God I did not! Ifow much better would it be for me&#xD;
-for you-for others-if we had never met&#xD;
And could he have gazed into the depths orher heart,&#xD;
he would have pitied her.&#xD;
"The stars were brightly shining," the moonbeams quiv.&#xD;
ered over the fountain, the soft summer breeze gently&#xD;
kissed their brows, but they spoke not. Genuine sorrow&#xD;
is ever dumb, and refuses to give uttered expression to&#xD;
those feelings which cannot be depicted in mere words,&#xD;
those skeletons of thought.&#xD;
"'So near, and yet so far'!" sighed Maud, as she&#xD;
arose. "We will return now.~~&#xD;
Offering her his arm, they walked slowly and sadly&#xD;
home, and found Colonel Jlartridge impatiently awaiting&#xD;
them.&#xD;
No twinge of jealousy had ever disturbed his equilib~&#xD;
rium; and he failed to notice that D'Estaing was unusu-&#xD;
ally taciturn, or5 that Maud's manner was very di~trct'it.&#xD;
Tea was soon served,, and, as the gentlemen were retiring&#xD;
to enjoy. their cigars, Maud excused herself, and in the&#xD;
sanctity of her own chamber Uius gave vent to her feel-&#xD;
ings:&#xD;
"Oh, thou cheat! thou hypocrite! thou delusion of a&#xD;
fanatic's brain! thou shadow that men vainly pursue!&#xD;

indAlference, was not impervious to its dulcet tones. Oh,&#xD;
those maio~uvring inammas I No wily politician, versed&#xD;
in the intrigues of a corrupt capital, becomes a greater&#xD;
proficient in his art than do these female in~rigantes in&#xD;
the profession of their adoption. Young women, whose&#xD;
mothers possess this kind of fnesse, need have no fears as&#xD;
regards their future state; for, be they pretty or ugly,&#xD;
bright or stupid, rich or poor, if they will only walk in&#xD;
the path planned for them by their feminine IRichelieu,&#xD;
their bark will at last be anchored in the harbor Matrb&#xD;

The vanity of a certain misanthropic gentleman 'viii~s&#xD;
wonderfully flattered as he read and reread the note of&#xD;
Ruth Leigh, the first thing the morning of Ia fete. Not&#xD;
indifferent to the compli~'nent contained in those few&#xD;
lines, he determined to comply with the request-thus&#xD;
disregarding a previous engagement, which until that&#xD;
moment he had held as sacred. Fortunately, his valise&#xD;
was packed, and, having only a few minutes, he sprang&#xD;
into a hack, and arriving in time, stepped upon the train&#xD;
just as it started. His movements had been too hasty for&#xD;
a message or a note, and whatever qualms of conscience&#xD;
intruded themselves in regard to the broken engagement,&#xD;
were silenced by the flattering- thought that h~s "fastidP&#xD;
ous taste" was to be consulted about the preparations&#xD;
going on at the "Hermitage." However, there was little&#xD;
leisure for reflection in the few minutes which brought&#xD;
him to the desired haven, and his handsome. face was&#xD;
wreathed in smiles, as, stepping from the cars, he caught&#xD;
a glimpse of Ruth leaning upon the gate which opened&#xD;
into her mother's grounds. In' another moment he had&#xD;
&#xD;
LA. F~T]3 CHAMP~TB]L             209&#xD;
&#xD;
joined her, and her childlike beauty filled him with fresh&#xD;
admiration, as she said, in silvery tones,&#xD;
"Ab, Mr. D'iEstaing, mamma will be so delighted that&#xD;
you have come! for she i~ in quite a dilemma about the&#xD;
grotto, or something-I don't ~know what it is, for I have&#xD;
been too busy with my toilettes, II regret to say, t6 be of&#xD;
much assistance to her."&#xD;
"My knowledge of such things is limited, Miss Leigh;&#xD;
but what little I do know, I wili feel honored in placing&#xD;
at your mother's command."&#xD;
"She said you had told her of a similar ~f~te you once&#xD;
attended in France, and she thought you might be able to&#xD;
give her some useful hints. But here she is, to speak&#xD;
for herself; and as I am superintending the pitching of&#xD;
some tents in the woods below, you will please excuse&#xD;
me.&#xD;
With these words, she bowed, and vanished beneath&#xD;
the overhanging branches of the grandest of grandjp~ks,&#xD;
which were rendered more beautiful by the long moss in&#xD;
which they were gracefully draped.&#xD;
Both mother and visitor were silent as they looked after&#xD;
her for a moment; then, with all that ease and elegance&#xD;
of manner for which the 'ladies of that particular section&#xD;
are so justly celebrated, Mrs. Leigh said,&#xD;
"how very kind of you to respond so promptly to our&#xD;
rather informal request, Mr. ID'Estaing I And believe&#xD;
me, I deeply appreciate your goodness."&#xD;
"Pray don't mention it, Mrs. Leigh," he said, grace~&#xD;
fully lifting his hat, and bowing with that indefinable&#xD;
ease which prevails among Southern gentlemen; "but as&#xD;
tur time is limited, let's to work."&#xD;

ageA' since Ruth's return from the city, which was no~&#xD;
more than two months. Each time he discovered some&#xD;
new beauty at this lovely country seat; and as Mrs.&#xD;
KLeigh and himself sauntered slowly down the grand aye-&#xD;
n uc which led to the house, he thought that, abroad or at&#xD;
home, he ha~ never seen any spot of earth which pleased&#xD;
him so thoroughly.&#xD;
Leaving them to seek their field of labor, the reader&#xD;
will join, unobserved, another party, in which the mem&#xD;
hers seemed to be unusually happy on that bright and&#xD;
cloudless morning; and even if the shadows do lengthen&#xD;
as the sun sweeps down to his western couch, why may&#xD;
not the cloud be snatched from the pathway of one of&#xD;
them? Because, "to live is to suffer!"&#xD;
Kate and Guy were chatting merrily, and Colonel&#xD;
Hartridge was in an unusual glee, as he assisted his beau.&#xD;
tiful young wife from the carriage. Then, bidding them&#xD;
a hasty adieu, he sent many "regrets" to Mr~~ Leigh at&#xD;
his inability to attend the fUe, and drove rapidly away,&#xD;
as the train moved off.&#xD;
The boxes were crowded with the dlite, the fashion,&#xD;
the beauty, and the chivalry of the Forest City, all of&#xD;
whom were em route for the "Hermitage," to participate&#xD;
in the last of the autumnal festivities. A magnificent&#xD;
brass band discoursed, most appropriately, "It is better to&#xD;
laugh than be sighing," and it bu1~ expressed the senti-&#xD;
inent of all hearts, for apparently it was the determine.&#xD;
Lion of the gay crowd to make it&#xD;
"The maddest, merriest day,&#xD;
Of all the glad new year."&#xD;
A shade of disappointment rested ll~Ofl Maud'~ face,&#xD;
&#xD;
LA Fh E CHAMP RB.            211&#xD;
as she peered in every direction and yet caught no glimpse&#xD;
of the one for whom she sought. This would only hav&#xD;
been perceptible to a close observer; and, fortunately for&#xD;
her, her friends were too happy to discover anything but&#xD;
happiness in others. Such intense love as this infatuated&#xD;
woman felt may be compared to Paradise on one side&#xD;
and Perdition on the other; a~d her fears and suspicions&#xD;
made her wretched beyond description, while she asked&#xD;
in vain, "Where can the absent one be?" Thus it would&#xD;
seem that love, that ideal thing, that shadowy myth, for&#xD;
which so many hearts are yearning, is but a mixture of&#xD;
smiles and tears, which brings more misery thaai happi-&#xD;
ness, and ends its brief existence in keen ~nd hitter dis..&#xD;
appointments. Then why is it so eagerly chased?&#xD;
Whilst Maud was indulging in these reflections, the&#xD;
train had moved steadily on, and they were now at the&#xD;
entrance to the " Ilermitage." Instead of following the&#xD;
crowd d~wn the broad avenue of oaks and moss, the trio&#xD;
in question took a winding path through the woods, and&#xD;
at leno'th found themselves in sight of a pavilion, which&#xD;
was remP~red particularly striking by the red and whke&#xD;
material of which it was composed. It covered a plat-&#xD;
form, which was carpeted and furnished in real Eastern&#xD;
style, while upon a miniature throne IMirs. Leigh sat,&#xD;
receiving her guests with an ease and elegance which&#xD;
would have done credit to the blood-royal. A little in&#xD;
the rear, Ruth .stood conversing with some gentleman&#xD;
whose back was turned to the party who advanced to pay&#xD;
their respects. After the customary salutations, Guy and&#xD;
Kate passed on,.but Maud lingered, and Mrs. Leigh then&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Ruth, here is an old friend."&#xD;

At these words, Ruth and the gentleman who was with&#xD;
her b0th turned, and Maud started, as D'Estaing unex~&#xD;
peetedly advanced and pressed her hand. The life of&#xD;
deception that society forces upon women makes them all&#xD;
actresses to some extent; and it was well for Mand, on&#xD;
this occasion, that she recovered herself so quickly, or she&#xD;
might have been mortified by an unpleasant scene. After&#xD;
exchanging the coldest conventionalities, she said,&#xD;
"Excuse me; I will rejoin my party."&#xD;
"Allow me to escort you," said D'Estaing, offering his&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
"Thank you; I prefer to go alone," was ths cold&#xD;
reply, as she gave him one withering glance and walked&#xD;
rapidly away.&#xD;
Kate was surrounded, as usual, by a gay party, and,&#xD;
after bowing to them, Maud said,&#xD;

he broken his engagement with her, and how came lie on&#xD;
such intimate terms with the Leighs?"&#xD;
Drinking the writer eagerly which Guy brought,: she,&#xD;
scarcely understood him wheft he said:&#xD;
"I hate to leave you alone, Coz, but will be compelled&#xD;
to do so, as I am to dance this quadrille with Kate. Or&#xD;
shall I tell her that you are ill, and bring her here?"&#xD;
"Not for the world! Indeed, I am quite ~veU flow,&#xD;

"Only upon one condition: and that is, that you honor&#xD;

CCI do not feel like dancing to-day, Guy."&#xD;
But, without noticing her words, he said,&#xD;
"Do not leave here, and when this quadrille is overA&#xD;
will return for you."&#xD;
Scarcely heeding him, she threw her head back against~&#xD;

LA F~E CHAMPErRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
away, the band 'ceased~ to play, and the gay dancers dis~&#xD;
persed. Merry peals of laughter rang out upon the&#xD;
woods, and the parti-colored costumes flitting here and&#xD;
there beneath the dark green foliage made the scene bril.&#xD;
liant beyond description.&#xD;
The fairy-like grounds were bathed in a gorgeous Octo.&#xD;
bei~ sun; the air was delicious and balmy as Spring, and&#xD;
to all save two the day was as joyous as a cherub's drear~&#xD;
Soon a charming galop was wafted on the air, and Guy&#xD;
came in haste to claim Maud as his partner. Seizing her&#xD;
by her hand, he rather forced than led her to the plat.&#xD;
form, and in another moment they were, floating in the&#xD;
mazy dance. Thus, in an instant, she had passed from&#xD;
the depths of despair into recklessness, as only women&#xD;
can.&#xD;
Having paused in the dance while Guy went for a&#xD;
glass of lemonade, she was rather startled, as ID'Estaing&#xD;
stood before her, and said,&#xD;
"What! are you dancing?"&#xD;
"And pray why not, since you set me so good an&#xD;
example?"&#xD;
"Ah, but I was dragged into it," he said, impatiently.&#xD;
"Which was not so light Q~ a task, I should imagine,"&#xD;
was the laughing reply.&#xD;
"Do you intend dancing again?"&#xD;
"Certainly she does!" said Guy. "Is it not better to&#xD;
laugh than be sighing?"&#xD;
Without noticing the speaker, D'Estaing again ad.&#xD;
dressed Maud, saying,&#xD;
"May I have the honor of the next dance?"&#xD;
"I am engaged."&#xD;
"Well, then, the next?"&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
LA FETE CHAMP TRE.             215&#xD;
&#xD;
"Eno~aoed."&#xD;
"And the next?"&#xD;
"Engaged." And, in her heart, Maud perhaps felt a&#xD;
pardonable triumph at thus checkmating him at his own&#xD;
game.&#xD;
"Then you are engaged for the whole day?" he asked,&#xD;
rather haughtily, while a sneer rested upon his peerless&#xD;
lip.&#xD;
"Yes," she answered, and her voice did not tremble,&#xD;
and her eye was steady as she returned his penetrating&#xD;
gaze. Like Prometheus in the burning marl, the pride&#xD;
of Women sustains them, what, though their hearts are&#xD;
breaking.&#xD;
"Come, Coz, let's finish the galop." And in another&#xD;
moment they were whirling around to the merry strains&#xD;
of music. D'Estaing stood looking after. her a little&#xD;
while, then walked slowly and sadly away.&#xD;
Why does the human heart ever court~ wretchedness~&#xD;
and endeavor to make misery more miser~i le? heaven&#xD;
knows, the clouds come thick and fast enough, without&#xD;
forcing out the few sunbeams that fall across life's path.&#xD;
way. But what a contradiction this same life is! All&#xD;
mankind are iii a mad chase after pleasure, and yet, in&#xD;
the very moment of grasping the visionary thing, it is&#xD;
changed into an anathema by their own folly and, capri~&#xD;
ciousi~ess. ~Vhat hypocrites society makes of men. and&#xD;

for her to do but to walk therein; for no woman with Ear&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC8258-00000108"/>&#xD;
wits about her would voluntarily provoke the gossip of&#xD;
he~' sisters, knowing as she does that their covert sneers&#xD;
and whispered thrusts would soon torture a saint into a&#xD;
fiend. These laws are such a wonderful combination of&#xD;
the angelic and satanic, that nothing short of Machia-&#xD;
velli's astute brain ~ould discover the mud and slime that&#xD;
lie at the bottom of the beautifully clear surface; and&#xD;
yet every one must walk therein, or be subjected to social&#xD;
ostracism.&#xD;
Maud's heart went with ID'Estaing; and could she have&#xD;
yielded to its guilty dictates, she would have followed&#xD;
him, and, throwing herself upon his bosom, would there&#xD;
ha~ve ~wept the tears which were pleading to be shed. But&#xD;
no; they must back to their "briny bed," and she must&#xD;
-     dance and laugh while her heart is breaking, for society&#xD;
demands the sacrifice, and would be outraged at any&#xD;
betrayal of feeling.&#xD;
On the banks of a beautiful lake which was skirted by&#xD;
woods, the tables were spread, and a sumptuous repast&#xD;
was served. But when the heart is lacerated, and torn,&#xD;
and bleeding, the far-famed "nectar and ambrosia" of&#xD;
the gods would tempt the appetite in vain; and so Maud&#xD;
thought, as, taking a cup ~f coffee only, she turned* in&#xD;
sickening disgust away fr~m the luxuries which were&#xD;
placed before her.&#xD;
At length dinner was over, and, after wandering&#xD;
around the beautiful grounds until the sun had gone&#xD;
down, the guests sought their respective chambers, in&#xD;
order .to snatch a little repose and make their toilettes foF&#xD;
the masquerade.&#xD;
had ~been seen or heard of D'Estaing since the&#xD;
morning, and Maud thought perhaps he had returned t~&#xD;
&#xD;
the city. But, away down in the woods, a man had&#xD;
thrown himself upon the groufid in utter dejection. His&#xD;
hat was drawn over his face, and the deep sighs whieli&#xD;
came from his heart were freighted with untold agony.&#xD;
They were thinking and dreaming of each other; and&#xD;
yet, how far apart they seemed! for she felt forsaken,&#xD;
while he thought her too resentful. And here is but&#xD;
another evidence of "how easily things go wrong."&#xD;
And when they shall be righted, is still another thing.&#xD;
After much persuasion, Maud had reluctantly yielded.&#xD;
to a request of Kate's, and they had exi~hanged costume&amp;amp;&#xD;
Kate had enjoyed a refreshing nap, and, as Mau4~av~&#xD;
the finishing touches to her toilette, she swept gracefully&#xD;
from the room, and called back, as she drew down here&#xD;
mask:&#xD;
"Don't be long, darling'?" and then was lost to sight.&#xD;
Scarce heeding her words, and crushed with the weight&#xD;
of a coming woe which she could hot throw off Maud&#xD;
sank into a chair, and cried, in the agony of her heart,&#xD;
"God help me!"&#xD;
If she had only helped herself, that cry had not been&#xD;
in vain, for God has never yet turned a deaf ear to those&#xD;
who seek Him in spirit and in truth.&#xD;
But alas! she trusted to a frail bark guided by human&#xD;
~) hands? Will it be wrecked? She raised up for herself&#xD;
an image of flesh and blood, and worshipped it with an&#xD;
idolatry which was wild in its madness. Will it be cast&#xD;

LA F~TE CHAMP ThE.&#xD;
diately surrounded by a crowd of gay makers, and, yield.&#xD;
lpg to their entreaties, was soon whirling in the giddy&#xD;
dance. Feeling no interest in attempting to make discov.&#xD;
eries, she traversed every room, hall, and gallery, but in&#xD;
vain, for no "Friar" gratified her anxious search.&#xD;
At the same hou~ Kate was standing upon an eastern&#xD;
balcony, listening with intense (?) interest to the undying&#xD;
protestations of a certain Spanish cavalier, who by arti&#xD;
ficial wits and natural stupidity had mk~saken her for his&#xD;
bright particular star. The conversation w~s suddenly&#xD;
interrupted by a maker in the costume of a "Friar,"&#xD;
who made his unexpected presence known, by saying,&#xD;
"Will the 'Goddess of Night' honor me with a prome~.&#xD;
nade?"&#xD;
happy to be rid of her insipid companion, Kate said:&#xD;
"With pleasure!" And taking the proffered arm, she&#xD;
added: "It is but right that we should commune to~&#xD;
gather, for the night alone spes and knows the many&#xD;
charitable deeds which are done by the holy order you&#xD;
represent."&#xD;
"Would that my heart w~s as pure as my outside dress&#xD;
signifies it should be 1"&#xD;
"Whose who underrate themselves are always the most&#xD;
worthy, I believe."&#xD;
A heavy sigh was the "Friar's" only response, and&#xD;
they walked on for some distance in silence. Kate, who&#xD;
was always courting adventure, thought she was now&#xD;
about to have a real ones a~ her mysterious escort took a&#xD;
by~.path which was comparatively quiet, and which was&#xD;
apparently ~visited only by themselves. The grounds&#xD;
were brilliantly illuminated, every tree being hung with&#xD;

LA. Yk~E CMP*1'1U~.&#xD;
heightened by the numbers of gayly-dressed promEnaders,&#xD;
who sought a moment's respite from the heated air of the&#xD;
rooms.&#xD;
The "Friar" did not doubt for an instant but that it ~&#xD;
was Maud who leaned upon his arm, for he never dreamed&#xD;
of such a thing as an exchange of costumes; and when&#xD;
the mask is down~ it gives a muffled tone to the voice&#xD;
which would easily prevent a recognition. At length&#xD;
they arrived at what seemed to be the entrance to a cave,&#xD;
and the "Friar" said,&#xD;
"If you will permit me, I will lead you to a spot where&#xD;
you may reign a veritable and undisputed queen."&#xD;
"It is the one spot above all others that I should like&#xD;
to visit."&#xD;
her words reassured him, and he verily believed that&#xD;
the one so eagerly looked for had her face hid beneath&#xD;
that star-spangled mask.&#xD;
"A live wizard and a~real adventure!" thought Kate,&#xD;
and her fearless heart fluttered with excitement as her,&#xD;
escort led her down a short subterranean passage, which&#xD;
soon opened into a gorgeous chamber all hung with ever~.&#xD;
greens, and brilliantly illuminated. The soft murm~ir&#xD;
gurgling water was heard, as the sprays of water from&#xD;
the fountain in the centre of the grotto sparkled and&#xD;
flashed in the blinding light, like so many diamond dIW~&#xD;
drops.&#xD;
A burst of admiration broke upon the silence, as K.Kate&#xD;
exclaimed;&#xD;
"how enchanting! Ah, I see it all-I am the heroine&#xD;
of one of the 'Arabian Nights" stories! This is your&#xD;
palace, and you are the 'Fairy Prince,' or the ei4~axtter,&#xD;

satisfied with the explanation I knew II could offer. Be~&#xD;

already given rise to unenviable remarks; and you~ know,&#xD;

folded his arms about her, when the mask was quickly&#xD;
thrown up, and, to his amazement, Kate Byrd said,&#xD;
"Mr. ID'Estaino~ you are mistaken in the person whom&#xD;

-~a~ love rejected-a love betrayed. Exceptthe splash.&#xD;
ing of the water in the fountain; the silence of death&#xD;
prevailed. After a while D'Estaing said, as if speaking&#xD;
to himself,&#xD;
"Great God! what have I 4one?"&#xD;
"Only made a slight mistakee" answered Kate, in her&#xD;
most taunting manner, while a bitter smile lurked in tho&#xD;
corners of her mouth; for, to tell the truth, she almost&#xD;
hated the man who sat cowering at her feet. Arising&#xD;
hastily,~ and with a depth of feeling which was not&#xD;
feigned, he said,&#xD;
"Miss Byrd, I am painfully aware of the state of yonx&#xD;
feelings towards me; but could you see into my heart~-&#xD;
could you know what a cruel wrong I have done her for&#xD;
whom I would freely lay down my life, I think that even&#xD;
yoz&amp;amp; would have pity-pity for her, not for myself. And&#xD;
now, by the love that you bear her, let me beg that this&#xD;
interview shall go down to the grave with you. Promise&#xD;
inc that it shall be buried so deep within your breast, that&#xD;
no human eyes can discover it, and that the resurrection~&#xD;
day alone shall discntomb it."&#xD;
Kate bore no malice against this proud man, who was&#xD;
now her supplant, and, being touched by the appeal he&#xD;
made in behalf of one whom she loved so dearly, and&#xD;
whom she would not injure ror the world, she said,&#xD;

"If you please." And, taking his proffered arm, they&#xD;
walked slowly and silently out of the grotto and along&#xD;
the serpentine walks.&#xD;
Kate wore a subdued and almost melancholy air;&#xD;
while D'Estaing's breathing came quick and hard, like&#xD;
that of a man struggling with a great grief. Just before&#xD;

upon him,&#xD;

to the beautiful house, which resembled an illuminated&#xD;

"If yon will excdse me, Miss Byrd, I will not go in."&#xD;
"Oert~iniy," said Kate, in a softened tone.&#xD;
Then taking her hand in both ide, lie looked beseech-&#xD;

"Let him discover who can. But how did you know&#xD;

"Wh~r, isn't your mask up?" laughed Guy.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
~~ThAR AND BILLIARDS."&#xD;
0 sparkling or tn-colored jets allured the passer-&#xD;
by into entering one of those dens of iniquity,&#xD;
which sometimes conceal their real character&#xD;
under the genteel 8obriquet of "Turf Exchange," "TI&amp;amp;&#xD;
'~alaxy," or "Pleasant hours." No; it was only plain&#xD;
"Bar and Billiards," so that whoever walked beneath that&#xD;
truthful sign did it with eyes wide open and the conse&#xD;
quences apparent.&#xD;
There had been a number of gay revellers assembled&#xD;
in this parth~ular saloon that evening, but it was now&#xD;
nearing midnight, and only a few of the most misguided&#xD;
.remained.&#xD;
Two men sat apart, in a corner to themselves, watching&#xD;
at a table a game of faro, and betting hea~vily. The one&#xD;
was a stranger, the other a citizen-a good, quiet, respect-&#xD;
able,, law-loving and law-abiding man, who had been&#xD;
lured'into this haunt of vice, by the tempting accounts of&#xD;
~his newly-found friend c?), who had, induced him to be- ~&#xD;
lie~e that he could realize the possession of wealth in a&#xD;
single night, an4. raise his family from poverty to riches.&#xD;
i~t was a mighty~st4ke f~r~which he played, and his' inter~&#xD;
est deepened as red or black told I~or or against'h~m' At&#xD;
&#xD;
first h~e staked all the money lie had; lie then put up hi~&#xD;
watch, furniture, his wife's piano, his house; and la~t ~4&#xD;
all his wife's jewels and silver, and saw thena all swept&#xD;
away by the relentless grasp of Chance. And thus one&#xD;
phase of recklessness begot another, and another, an4&#xD;
another, until White was wild. That he was not hhns~W&#xD;
could have been easily discovered; and the cause was&#xD;
soon explained, for a lunch-table near them was covered&#xD;
with empty bottles, the labels of which betrayed what&#xD;
had been the nature of their contents-poison for the&#xD;
brain, poison for the heart, and death in the glow an4&#xD;
sparkle.&#xD;
White drank and better, and better and drank, until&#xD;
all of his pecuniary possessions slipped from him, an4&#xD;
until he knew he was ruined beyond the power of retrieve.&#xD;
Although heated by stwng potations and excited by play,&#xD;
he was not insensible to the fact that the morrow would&#xD;
find his family houseless and penniless; and already the&#xD;
cries of his children for bread, and the moans of his d~.&#xD;
dressed wife, sounded in his ears. Goaded to desperation&#xD;
~iy these harrowing thoughts, he determined to make eue&#xD;
inal effort to secure ~vhat he had so recklessly throw~i&#xD;
away. ~o, draining a glass'of brandyhe said, with an&#xD;

it t" And 'he tightened his clasp around, his enemy's&#xD;
throat, who gasped,&#xD;
"Never! never 1"&#xD;
Thex, as quick as thought, this midnight assassin&#xD;
plunged a dagger up to the hilt in t~he breast of poor&#xD;
White, who uttered a single broken shriek, and fell fQr'&#xD;
ward on his face. At the same moment, the pistol held&#xD;
in ~iis hand went off, hut; beii~g aiinkss, it ~vas only a&#xD;
stray shot, and the villain at whom it should have been&#xD;
~oi:ied stood gloating over the triumph of the dead and&#xD;
the ruined.&#xD;
D'Estaing, who was passing by from his office on Bay&#xD;
street to his rooms at the Pulaski House, hearing the&#xD;
,uoise, entered just in time to lift the dying man in his&#xD;
arms as he drew his last breath. The perpetrator of this&#xD;
horrible deed still stood there as one petrified, while the&#xD;
clenched' dagger in his hand was reeking with blood.&#xD;
D'Estaiug looked up at him.&#xD;
&#xD;
"My God ~ what have you done?" he exclaimed.&#xD;
"Murderer! villain!"&#xD;
The eyes of these two men met.&#xD;
"What! Delamere-here!" cried the stranger, hii&#xD;
wicked eyes staring out with a frightened though stonV&#xD;
expression.&#xD;
"Here!" answered D'Estaing, "and not afraid to&#xD;
inect an unscrupulous villain by the name of Bonne.&#xD;
theau!" he added, with intrepid coolness.&#xD;
"Since when did you turn saint? Since~ the murder&#xD;
of your cousin, Gustave Delainere?" said Bonnethean,&#xD;
"Seize this man!" said D'Estaing to the bystanders'&#xD;
as he held his dead burden in his arms.&#xD;
"Let him who dares touch me at his peril!" crie&amp;amp;&#xD;
Bonnetheau, flourishing the bloody dagger over his dishes~&#xD;
elled head; "for I swear mo~t solemnly to kill that main&#xD;
who may lay the weight of his finger upon me!" And 4.&#xD;
as he stood mad in the rage of an infuriated demon, n~&#xD;
one seemed willing to defy his threats.&#xD;
Stupefied by liquor and late hours, the three or four&#xD;
loafers who still lounged about the saloon were ne~i~ '&#xD;
asleep than awake, and, instead of coming to the~ai44 1,&#xD;
ID'Estaing, they all seemed terrified into inaction; an4&#xD;
not until it was too late, were they fully aroused to ~&#xD;
horror 'of the situation and the necessity of action.&#xD;
By this time l3onnetheaii~. had waThed' around to the&#xD;
entrance ~on Bull street, and, standing in the doo~ cast &amp;amp;&#xD;
backward glance toward D'Estaing, as he hisse4/betweer~&#xD;

and, turning the lifeless body of' the murdered man' ovei&#xD;
to one of the bystanders, he rushed fearlessly after the&#xD;
murderer. Even before he had gained the door, Bonne~&#xD;
thean was a square away, and ere the alarm could be&#xD;
given to the police, at least a mile, fleeing as rapidly as&#xD;
* he could in the direction of the woods.&#xD;
Unsuspicious of such a movement, D'Estaing and the&#xD;
detectives scoured the city from attic to basement;' but&#xD;
the wretch had made his escape, and the only consolation&#xD;
that could be derived in all the horrible detail of this&#xD;
tragedy was in the fact that he did, not dare return and&#xD;
claim the house and property of the widow and orphans.&#xD;
But that was of little avail to them-little to the man&#xD;
who was dead to the outraged community-dead to God,&#xD;
whose laws he had defied.&#xD;
"Thou shalt do no murder." Thus said the Lord of&#xD;
Illiosts, amid the glory of Sinai, when the lawgiver of&#xD;
Israel heard his voice above the thunder which proclaimed&#xD;
Ills majesty. And yet, such murders as these nightly&#xD;
blacken the scroll' of crime, and the Gains step forth from&#xD;
K' ~loons rich in gilding ~nd pictures and tapestries, and;&#xD;
K with the corpses of their viduki~ dangling to their skirts,&#xD;
find excuse, perchance, in some cunningly-used 'legal&#xD;

force be made to wink or tolerate.&#xD;
are equally guilty who patronize "The Turf Ex&#xD;
change,"'" The Galaxy," or.j' Bar and l3illiard3;" and&#xD;
outside of their fatal portals, who can know the destroyci&#xD;
front the destroyed? It is well, society owes much to the&#xD;
rigor of judgment, which is nearly akin to injustice.&#xD;
Gambling is a vice, in any and in avery form in which it&#xD;
~may be presented; but there shoul~l be a difference made,&#xD;
&#xD;
in a moral point of view, between the victim ~ud the vk~&#xD;
timized-the man whom a morbid thirst for excitement&#xD;
drives to drink of the poisoned bowl, and the practiced&#xD;
villain whose business it 'is to point or lead the way to&#xD;
where it is presented in its most fascinating fonn&amp;amp;~&#xD;
wreathed with flowers and heavy with aroma, glittering&#xD;
with gold and sparkling like the diamond.&#xD;
Is' murdered morality more venial than the murder of&#xD;
the physical body? Is religion of God, or God where&#xD;
such crimes are practiced? Is law justice, or~ is ther~'&#xD;

And ~what though in~re than seven ceLturies have&#xD;
passed away since this unhappy couple trod the tragic&#xD;
boards of life? Their memories are still embalmed in the&#xD;
richest aroma of romance, and their double grave is one&#xD;
of the greatest attractions at P~re le Chaise.. Flowers&#xD;
are ever abloom upon them; if not the fresh, culled from&#xD;
the prolific gardens of sunny France, the same immor&#xD;
tells which till late wreathed the iron balustrade around&#xD;
the column of Yend6me, from which the elligy of the&#xD;
~t Emperor looked down over gay, beautiful, surging,&#xD;
heartless Paris.&#xD;
No matter how outraged patriots, philanthropists, phil.&#xD;
osophers, and the world generally, in~y feel by s'ich an&#xD;
assertion, it is evident that no other sentiment of the&#xD;
Jan man heart has ever elicited such profound and widely-&#xD;
extended sympathy as love. And it would seem that this&#xD;
mysterious, inexplicable feeling, which passes through the&#xD;
heart as the electric current flies through air, is the one&#xD;
grand bond uniting the souls of mankind, and making&#xD;
them beat as with a single throb. It is the same setiti-&#xD;
gient which makes them realize a secret pleasure in res4-&#xD;
bag the loves of Petrarch andiLaura, Dante and Beat~'jce,&#xD;
Tasso and Leonora D'Est~, Antony and Cleopatra, J3yron&#xD;
sand Mary Chaworth; though with this "divine passion"&#xD;
there is so often interwoven the elements of sin, as in the&#xD;
fairesf of flowers there may be the essence of the deadli-&#xD;
est poison. But weighing all the pros and eons the one&#xD;
against the other, who but the snarling Diogenes will not&#xD;

the crime, of ~orshipping at an earthly shrine, antiN~e&#xD;
the importance for laying up treasure ~" wheri~ neith~&#xD;

At any rate, if love is to be immortalized, let it not be&#xD;
the hot-house passion born of forced sentiment and nui~&#xD;
tured by guilt-the intriguing devotion of Abelard for&#xD;
Heloise, as seen through French eyes, nor the unpardon~&#xD;
alAe attachment of D'Estaing for Maud llartridg~. Let&#xD;
it be the feeling which grows out of mutual esteem, con~&#xD;
genial tastes and sympathies, ieverential virtue,. couee~&#xD;
crated by the marriage rite, and strengthened by years of&#xD;
trial through the usual ordeal of domestic life. Let it ba&#xD;
the last attendant of the dying pillow, the companionship&#xD;
of that far-off Eden which all are striving for, and hop~.&#xD;
ing to attain when the passage of the "Yale of Tears " is&#xD;
made, and the light of eternity bursts upon the blinded&#xD;
eyes of mortality. Then there surely shall be no iteed of&#xD;
monuments, nor strangers to bestrew graves with flowers&#xD;
but such an example will rear its own mausoleum; and.&#xD;

~fen have the world before them, to use and bend it at&#xD;
will; 1)Ut women's duties are prescribed, and to a great&#xD;
measure are born with them. Theirs is not infrequently&#xD;
a hard lot and a sad one; and love is the only "nepen.&#xD;
the" that can soften and make it endurable. Then let&#xD;
xiot men withhold it. Let them be tender with their&#xD;
mothers, patient with their wives, gentle to their sisters,&#xD;
and the lover, in the father to the daughter. Their re&#xD;

hearts shall throb, and the angels in heaven will smile&#xD;

"Do I think I love you? Why, whs~t a strange ques-&#xD;
tion 1" said Ruth, in the brilliant moonlight t1~at flooded&#xD;
the balcony where they sat, her eyes looking the love her&#xD;
lips refused to speak.&#xD;
Their ~gagement was now openly acknowledged, and&#xD;
Ruth was not more radiantly happy than her mother was&#xD;
gratified. But was ID'Estaing happy? Did no memory&#xD;
of departed days haunt him? Did no \spectre of her&#xD;
who was forsaken rise up before him, and with beseech~&#xD;
iiig eyes say, "Look on the ruii~. you have wrought?"&#xD;
Three months of almost c~ii~ant intercourse with Ruth&#xD;
had brought D'Est~ing to her feet, and nearly obliterated&#xD;
9thcr days and other faces from his memory. Is anyone&#xD;
~ shocked? him stud men more closel and there&#xD;
A will be no occasion for surprise again.&#xD;
It wonk. not, however, e just, to say that, the conduct&#xD;
~f D'Estaing was premeditated. It seemed purely the&#xD;
consequence of accident. The misunderstanding on the&#xD;
morning of the fete, the resentment, and the culminating&#xD;
scene in.7 the grotto, had all combined to hasten the result.&#xD;
From the niokuent '~when he discovered ~he exchange of&#xD;
&#xD;
"TH1~(LD; OLD 8TOBY.~~&#xD;
&#xD;
costumes, he believed Maud false. ~That she w~ iiripe.&#xD;
rious and exacting, he knew, and from that hour hi8 w~t&#xD;
ship grew less intense, his love waned. And a~ day t~fte1&#xD;
(lay of comparative tranquillity passed by, he ab~ohitdy&#xD;
felt a relief at being~ rid of the tyranny under whieli he&#xD;
had lived for so many months. He was lonely and&#xD;
wretched, with no friend or relative to whom he could&#xD;
turn for sympathy. Mrs. Leigh and Ruth wei~e ufiren1itd~&#xD;
ting in their kiiidnesses; and their attentions fell upc~n&#xD;
his weary heart like dew upon the opening flowers that&#xD;
were withering in too fierce sunshine.&#xD;
Every day saw him a visitor at the "Hermitage," and.&#xD;
every day he returned to the eity with a positive engage-&#xD;
ment, either for breakfast, dinner, or tea, with his newly~&#xD;
made friends.&#xD;
lie was sad and thoughtful; Ruth was gay and cheery.&#xD;
He needed a friend, and Mrs. Leigh soothed him ii1 mo~&#xD;
ments of depression and gloom. Both mother and d~u~h-&#xD;
ter extended to him, the sympathy and tenderness craved&#xD;
by his storm-beaten heart; and who can. wonder at the&#xD;
result?&#xD;
It sometimes happens that those very women who would&#xD;
give the last drop of their heart's blood for that worsh4~&#xD;
from the other sex that is their due, drive the subject of&#xD;
this idolatry from them, by the tyrannous demands of&#xD;
mere caprice. Q~ove prefers amusement to torture~ ~n4&#xD;
herein is readily found the cause of D'Estaing's seeming&#xD;

at last yielded to the earnest entreaties of D'Estaing, and&#xD;
the time for the celebration of the nuptials was near at&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Why such haste?"&#xD;
Thd he fear that some invisible hand. would snatch his&#xD;
idol from him? Does not every one harbor such fears,&#xD;
when they prize and love an object very dearly?&#xD;
Sitting in the moonlight, the calm, soft breezes wafting&#xD;
to them the incense of the flowers, their souls attuned&#xD;
~ to beauty, their hearts to melody, they told their love in&#xD;
soft, sweet whispers, and talked of the hour which should&#xD;

were festooned curtains of the richest and heaviest s~&#xD;
~brocatelie; while each room was fr1rnished in ~ll the ~&#xD;
geousness and extravagance of Eastern luxury. - The car~&#xD;
pets were of the richest velvet; and the eyes were feasted&#xD;
on ~ from the hands of masters; statues of the&#xD;
most exquisite design and finish, antique bronzes, vases 4&#xD;
the rarest workmanship, and a wealth of ornament that&#xD;
can better be imagined than described. The chandeliers,&#xD;
which flooded the rooms with a soft, mellow light, were&#xD;
of the finest cut-glass, in the rarest patterns; and their&#xD;
prismatic pendants sent quivering rainbow4ints flashing&#xD;
in every direction. The walls were tastefully frescoed,&#xD;
and delicious harmony, elegance, and a faultless fancy&#xD;
pervaded each room, from the dainty play-room in sky~&#xD;
blue to the breakfast-parlor in fresh rose-color, the sea~&#xD;
green of a beautifully-arranged library, and the soft&#xD;
warm crimson of the reception-parlor. There was noth..&#xD;
ing pronomed, xiaught that savored in the least of the&#xD;
&amp;amp;~ornmon or vulgar, in the appointments of the place of&#xD;
habitation- of Alfr~do do Yore, but everything bespoke.&#xD;
purity 9f taste and high cultivation. But, notwithsta~d-.&#xD;

of money failed to bring happiness, or even comfort. He&#xD;
never slept the sweet, natural sleep of one whose mind is&#xD;
at peace; but when "tired Nature's sweet restorer"&#xD;
folded its soothing wings over his couch, it was induced&#xD;
by the heavy potations ivhich bring stupor rather than&#xD;
rest.&#xD;
When it .is remembered that only they whose~c'2~u.&#xD;

ehe'~ who still lingered in De Yore's apartments evinced&#xD;
rio symptoms of weariness. The air was heavy with the&#xD;
incense which forever ascended from those rooms, and&#xD;
redolent with the odors of rare flowers; and in' this close&#xD;
~t~n~phere, the mixture of cigar-smoke, the perfume of*&#xD;
exotics, and gas, was almost stifling; but the revellers&#xD;
wera scarcely affected by it, flushed as they were with&#xD;
~irii~e and' ~e~cited by cards. As usual, their host had&#xD;
heen successful, and, of course, was in the finest spirits.&#xD;
I1e~ had finally agreed to play "quits" for that night at&#xD;
i~a~t; and as they idly lounged there, smoking their&#xD;
choice llavanas, the following conversation occurred:&#xD;
"And so you are certain it was' Delamere?" came in&#xD;
~liose musical tones which are so irresistible to women.&#xD;
"~My life upon. it!" answered Bonnetheau, accompany-&#xD;
ing the declaration with such a blow of his fist upon the&#xD;
table as to endanger the safety of the cut~glass decanters&#xD;
and delicate wine-glasses. "And what do you think I&#xD;
&#xD;
~C3~ LIF'E tTPOl~ iTt"&#xD;
The rascal ordered me to be seized, as though I had bees&#xD;
a cut-throat or a highway robber!"&#xD;
"For' what'?" cried several voices at once.&#xD;
"Why, because I-&#xD;
"Out with it!" cried one.&#xD;
"Don't be afraid!" said another.&#xD;
Seeing that retreat was impossible, this mendacious viV&#xD;
lain stammered,&#xD;
"Well, you see, roaming 'around the country, I. got&#xD;
caught down. in. Savannah, and running upon one of&#xD;
innocent chaps ~ho knows nothing of~ life behind- the-&#xD;
scenes, 1 soon made havoc with what little he had; where~&#xD;
npon he flew into a rage, a~id, with a pistol pointed at my&#xD;
breast, demanded the return of the spoils; at which I&#xD;
told him, if he did not release me, I should kill him;&#xD;
and, refusing, I rid myself of his grip upon my thrQat&#xD;
by a dexterous dagger-thrust."&#xD;
"You did not murder him?" said De Vere, in a toxi~ ~&#xD;
of surprise and pain.&#xD;
"Well, I don't know; I hope I did not kill him I&#xD;
said the false scoundrel, assuming a look and 4~bne of the&#xD;
most gentle deprecation.&#xD;
"It is indeed to be hoped not!" said Da Vere, with&#xD;
more than wanted earnestness. But, seeming not to&#xD;
notice this, I3onnetheau proceeded:&#xD;
"Just at this stage Qf the game, who should step in but&#xD;
Delaniere, who, taking the fellow in. his arms, tuni~t t~&#xD;
the few loafers in. the 8a1on~, and ordered theta to arrest&#xD;
"So you did have some unpleasant words with him ?&#xD;

%3i0.&#xD;
"And you would like to be revenged?" asked Do&#xD;
V'ere.&#xD;
"Shouldn't I? I should like to see him at the stake o~&#xD;
the gallows ; "-..and the grin of a demon lighted up his&#xD;
earthyy visage. But for the wine which was coursing&#xD;
hotly through his veins, Bonnethean would never have&#xD;
been so comm~unicative. It was fortunate for him that&#xD;
the bond of eternal secrecy-~..-the "honor among thieves"&#xD;
~~-was imposed upon all who entered those rooms, or his&#xD;
own disclosure would have doomed him. his compam.&#xD;
ions wore a set of desperate, adventurous foreigners, and&#xD;
this fact, ~s much as their profession, allied them closely.&#xD;
No one replied to l3onnetheau's last remark; they did&#xD;
not wish to commit themselves, and all eyes turned upon&#xD;
Do VerQ, as ho sat by a table with his face buried in his&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
Surprise and wonder were depicted in every county~&#xD;
nance; and after a few moments of profound silence,&#xD;
Do Yore arose, and said, in his courtliest manner,&#xD;
"I beg that you will all excuse me now;" lint as they&#xD;
arose to depart, he added, quickly, "Do not go, I pray&#xD;
you, because I must leave, but remain as long as you may&#xD;
Iind it pleasant. My valet will close the rooms when you&#xD;
feel like retiring. Au revoir!" And, lowing to all&#xD;
around, he left their presence.&#xD;
And so they remained, and talked long and earnestly&#xD;
about this unexpected, and what promised to be exciting,&#xD;
news.&#xD;
Do Yore, upon reaching his bed.~chamber, had thrown&#xD;
~dn~eli ~~pon hi~ bed with Ida clothes on, but n~ot to sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
Iliad he given expression to his thoughts in words, the fob&#xD;
lowing soliloquy would have been .divulged :~&#xD;
"Aifd at last the bird has been caught! After six&#xD;
years of fruitless search, after paying, out thousands t6&#xD;
detectives, the whereabouts of the murderer have been&#xD;
discovered; and the ni~n who brings the news asks noth.&#xD;
ing but the privilege of helping to bring him to jnstiee.&#xD;
And Elise claims at my hands the life of this man, before&#xD;
she will consent to become the wedded partner of my.&#xD;
crimes. They who know the secret could be bribed into&#xD;
silence, and the life of this unfortunate man could be&#xD;
spared. I have nothing against him, and, God knows, my&#xD;
crinles are already sufficiently numerous to sink my soul&#xD;
to perdition. But then-Elise! Well, she is mine at&#xD;
any rate, but not in the eye of the law; and so tong. as&#xD;
she is my employee, I wince to think of the thousands~ I.&#xD;

Carlyle says,  ~ All life is a tragedy;" and so thought&#xD;
this erring cre4j~e in those days, when forsaken by the&#xD;
object of her love. She despised herself, and longed to&#xD;
die--to die! As if that were all-as if that were all of&#xD;
the ~ou1's existence and responsibility I&#xD;
If the soul's annihilation'were the consequence of the&#xD;
cessation of the mortal life, who would care or deign. to&#xD;
-- live and suffer? 'the Bard of Avon fitly- tells what&#xD;
"m~&amp;amp;kc~s cowards of us ally' when we might a blessed&#xD;
qnietu~ make "with a bare bodkin," in "the 4r~ac1 (4&#xD;

something after death," which "puzzles the will, and&#xD;
makes us rather bear the ills we have, t1~an fly to othei~&#xD;
that we know not of."&#xD;
If men undertake to beai~ those ills alone, the yoke will.&#xD;
be heavy and the journey ~9ng and weary. "Come unto&#xD;
me, all ye that labor and a~'e heavy-laden, a-nd I will give -&#xD;
you rest," saith the Lord God of hosts.&#xD;
But if, instead of going ~ Him and imploring lli~ aid&#xD;
and guidance, with proud ~nd rebellious will men close&#xD;
their hearts to all such pre ~iou~ consolation, and, with a&#xD;
wickedness that amounts to iinpiousness, ask why God has&#xD;
sent this or that affliction upon them, then mercy will&#xD;
nQt be outraged in the extr nest rigor of justice.&#xD;
Like many another benighted soul, IMlaud groped ~n&#xD;
spiritual darkness. Her conscious guilt deprived her of&#xD;
the comfortincr influences of Christ's holy religion, which&#xD;
alone gives power to resist~ the evil temptations of th~ - -&#xD;
world, apd to sustain when ~lie afflictions incident to life&#xD;
overwhelm, or the cr&amp;amp;~s~s ~nd temptations vex or lead&#xD;
astray. It is a common thin for men to forget God an4 ~&#xD;
their obligations to him, when life's pathway is strewn&#xD;
with ioxvers, and when the ~up of- pleasure is so full that&#xD;
only a light rose-leaf will prevent its overflow; while it&#xD;
is a sad commentary upon 4ie weakness and ingratitude&#xD;
of the human soul, when m~n are driven to seek refuge&#xD;
at the Throne of Grace only as the world tufts its back&#xD;
and refuses them shelter.&#xD;
Innocent and guileless as i~uth was, she aid not suspect&#xD;
that her joy was another's woe; and, indeed, no one&#xD;
except Kate discerned, the palIng cheek and drooping&#xD;

&#xD;
i~ioments when despair lifted from, her heart its iron&#xD;
dutch. But, without a groan or a sigh in others' hear.&#xD;
ing, she steeled herself to endure the bitterest trial that&#xD;
can come to a woman's heart-p--the fear or knowledge of~&#xD;
the fact that the heart she deemed wholly her own was&#xD;
shared, with or in. the keeping of another. But in the&#xD;
secret recesses of her soul, in the privacy of her chamber,&#xD;
and in the darkness of tho night, when. others slept, she&#xD;
unmasked her woe to the eyes of her Maker, and laid her&#xD;
heart all bare. She did not pray; she could not lift up&#xD;
her eyes to Him with such crimes festering in her soul.&#xD;
So, "the long, long, weary days," passed in tears away,&#xD;
"and' still at evening found her weeping."&#xD;
On one of those dreary evenings, Kate and IRuth had&#xD;
gone out driving with Colonel I-Jlartridge. Tie was trying&#xD;
a pair of recently-purchased horses. Maud had made&#xD;
some pretext for not accompanying them-glad to be left&#xD;
alone-and sought some distraction. to her heart-sorrows&#xD;
in. her~ long-neglected music.&#xD;
She had played that grandest of all dirges, "Morte,"&#xD;
by' Qottschalk, and still her lingers ran over and over it,&#xD;
as if the weird chords could extract some of the fiery&#xD;
anguish that was turning ou.t her life. But the pain each&#xD;
moment grew more' and more intense, until at last, with a&#xD;
low waWand hands passed over her heart, she bowed her&#xD;
head upon the music-rack and sobbed aloud4&#xD;
Another evening of more than two years previous will&#xD;
be vividly recalled, when, at the hour of midnight she&#xD;
sat weeping over the ills of life, and thinking tha er-&#xD;
1'iaps, the future held in store for her the treasure o p'&#xD;
pines which had neither blessed her childhood %o ight"&#xD;

seemed beset with cruel~Ths, end, as 1~he years advanced,&#xD;
the darkness thickened. The outside world th&#xD;
had much for which to be envied; but           she&#xD;
when does th&#xD;
envy of others for fancied superior' bi&#xD;
contenttnent or happiness ~       essings ever bring ~.&#xD;
As for those few, brief hours upon which she '1ook~d&#xD;
back as hours of unalloyed bliss, what were they but the&#xD;
"mirth of despair" ?' And they who have had&#xD;
of her inner ILCe knew they were far more full f te~x's~&#xD;
than smiles. happiness in the abstract is very diffei~eut&#xD;
from what it is in the realization; and nothing is evpr&#xD;
quite equal in the enjoyment to the vividness of anticipa~&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
The twilight was deepening no less surely than.' the.&#xD;
sunlight wa~ fading out of INland's sky; yet stilt she&#xD;
sat in the* deep, stealthy gloaming, while the heavy sobs.&#xD;
rent her bosom, and the unshed tears seo~ched her eye-&#xD;
balls.&#xD;
She thought she was~ alone, and did not seek to repress&#xD;
these evidences of her misery; but a well-known voice,&#xD;
in the softest and tenderest tone, said,&#xD;
"IMlaud! "&#xD;
"Who is it that calls me!" she exclaimed, springing&#xD;
frorg the piano-stool, and laying one cold hand upon her&#xD;
qpivering heart.&#xD;
"It is I, INland; do not be frightened ; "-and once&#xD;
more she was folded to the breast of the man to whom&#xD;
she had guiltily yielded her soul's worship. Though it&#xD;
wa~ but for a single instant that she gave Ii orin to h~s&#xD;

disengaging his vise-like clasp from around her waist, sh~&#xD;
drew herself ~ haughtily away, and, choking back her&#xD;
bursting sighs, said,&#xD;
"Because I cannot~forget!-aIid~IhOldIfly5eU in utter&#xD;
contempt!"&#xD;
"Neither have I forgotten, believe nie!" he replied, in&#xD;
his deep, full, rich tones, and his voice trembled, as he&#xD;
added, "But it will be better for both of us I"&#xD;
"What will be better?" burst excitedly from her trem.&#xD;
bling lips.&#xD;
"That I should be married," he answered, truthfully&#xD;
and fearlessly.&#xD;
Then it was true that he did contemplate marriage.&#xD;
She could no longer doubt it. Sinking down upon the&#xD;
stool, she buried hor face in her h~nds, and the last hope&#xD;
of what might be, winged its flight from her heart, and&#xD;
left it in impenetrable gloom.&#xD;
There was a painful pause, a dread silence, only inter-&#xD;
rupted by the spasmodic breathing of the wretched man&#xD;
and woman over whom the purple vei~l of twilight was&#xD;
deepening to the black of night, and~ this was broken by&#xD;
~Iaud.&#xD;
"I--i am sure-I wish you much happiness."&#xD;
I~r~wing r~earer her and taking her hand, D'Estaing&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Come, come, :Maud! let there be no useless conceal-&#xD;
ments between us. You still reign queen of my soul.&#xD;
~o not think, I beseech you, that any other woman ever&#xD;
could usurp your place there."&#xD;
She made no reply to this, but began to wonder whether&#xD;
it might or might not be that the 4istant future held a&#xD;

&#xD;
day in which she should become reconciled to seeing him&#xD;
another's. But her reverie was soon disturbed.&#xD;
"I have been ~aimo~t dragged. into this engagement,"&#xD;
said the man, who, seemed but the tool of some myst&amp;amp;&#xD;
rious fate. "I~uth is a sweet little creature, ~ am willing&#xD;
to confess, and byes me with all the devotion of her&#xD;
nature; and, lonely wanderer that I am, I almost believe,&#xD;
sometimes, she has been thrown across my way to brighten&#xD;
my dreary life."&#xD;
What unprecedented vanity! As if he bad ever done&#xD;
anything to merit a good turn either by the wheel of For-&#xD;
tune or by the Divine will!&#xD;
"And you love her?" asked Maud, reproachfully.&#xD;
"Not as I lov~ you, deare~t. But only think how cold&#xD;
and cruel you have been to me ever Gince that fatal fete /&#xD;
had it not been for our misi~inderstanding on that unfor~&#xD;
tunate day, I would not now perhaps be the betrothed&#xD;
lover of another. I have, however, come to make one&#xD;
more proposition to you. If, as you say, I am the only ~&#xD;
man you ever truly loved, why do you hesitate-why have&#xD;
you hesitated-to fly with me, away from the legal and &#xD;
conventional trammels which forbid our union P&#xD;
She shi~ddered, and receded from him, the hot l~Q4&#xD;
burning her face and neck.&#xD;
"Pray do not presume to breathe this to me again. ~&#xD;
she gasped. "God knows my crime is great enough&#xD;
already."&#xD;
"And yet you would deny me the privilege you enjoy~&#xD;
of a home, and some one to love me!"&#xD;
"The privil%1e I" Her tone, filled with loathing, ex&#xD;
pressed all the disgust which, in the ingratiti~de of hei&#xD;
heart, she felt for one whose greatest fault was loving her&#xD;

,too ~veil ~and ministering too carefully to her every wisb&#xD;
and caprice.&#xD;
A painful pause ensued, broken at length by D'Es'&#xD;
taing:&#xD;
"The fact is, this ~tft'aire of mine was so well managed&#xD;
by both mother and daughter, I was fairly committed&#xD;
before I was quite cei'tain what I was doing. You drove&#xD;
tue to desperation; this child soothed me. And when it&#xD;
was too late to recede, I fancied that perhaps, in a home&#xD;
of nay oWn) I might find a tithe of the peace to which I&#xD;
have been so long a stranger. If I do not, I shall be in&#xD;
a more pitiable condition than the wrecked mariner on&#xD;
his fragment of spar on the wide ocean. Now, do. not&#xD;
chide in~ ~any more. Only say you will love me, as I&#xD;

But flQ word left her lips, though a single tear fell upon&#xD;
the hand which had passionately 'grasped hers.&#xD;
'~Promise nie, darling. Quick! IL hear footsteps and&#xD;
voices. A moment more, and this heaven will be shut&#xD;
away from my sight; it will be too late. Say that you&#xD;
will love 1n~, as I feel you love me now!"&#xD;
As these worck fell upon her famished heart, how&#xD;
longed ~ho for more faith in him! how yearned she for&#xD;
the love that she. must throw aside as the *cup filled With&#xD;

the altar of matrimony is consecrated. No amount of&#xD;

With the sound of the merry voices in the vestibule,&#xD;
D'Estaing lighted the gas, while Thud commenced play-&#xD;

"I ~ glad you enjoyed it. Mr. ,D'Estaing, Kate."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXYL&#xD;
TIlE WEDDING.&#xD;
HE wedding-day had come at last, for "time and&#xD;
2 tide wait for no man,~~ not even in the Forest&#xD;
City.&#xD;
The bride was radiant in her happiness; the forsaken&#xD;
one, bowed beneath a load of guilt, walked through the&#xD;
"valley of humiliation," on to the "valley of the shadow&#xD;
of death;" while the bridegroom hovered between hope&#xD;
and fear, and vainly endeavored to dispel the gloomy&#xD;
forebodings which beset and enthralled him. Maud&#xD;
shuddered, as, drawing back the heavy folds of silken&#xD;
damask curtains of her chamber windows that morning,&#xD;
her eyes were greeted by a lowering sky and a cold, driv-&#xD;
ing mist. The sky was all white-dead white; and&#xD;
minute beaded drops, like seed-pearls, rested on every&#xD;
blad~ of grass, every leaf and twig, and in an icy shower&#xD;
over the dark green foliage of the live oaks. A keen&#xD;
north-east wind was blowing, and, as the storm increased&#xD;
in fury, there. recurred to her mind, and she whispered.&#xD;
&#xD;
249&#xD;
&#xD;
shudderingly, "Cursed is the bride that the rain falls&#xD;
on," and, turn where she would, these words rang in he~&#xD;
ears, or were. written before the eyes of her spirit in let~&#xD;
ters of funereal black.&#xD;
Were they omino~~s of evil? Impossible! for within&#xD;
the walls of the "Hermitage" everything seemed raai&#xD;
ant and jQyons. Mother and daughter little heeded&#xD;
the dim, leaden, white cloi~ds that draped the blue&#xD;
sky, or the driving blast, or the penetrating mist, except&#xD;
to regret the out-door illuminations. They were not&#xD;
infected with grim superstitions nor old wives' fables;&#xD;
and as the mother superintended the decorations of the&#xD;
rooms and table, a smile of happy triumph lit up her aris~&#xD;
tocratic face, and gave elasticity to her movements. The&#xD;
daughter; buoyan~with the hopes enkindled at the altar&#xD;
of her girlish devotion, made the house ring with merry&#xD;
songs, while her gay laugh gushed out like the ripple of&#xD;
a spring rivulet.&#xD;
After a while a package arrived from him who filled&#xD;
her every thought. Deeming it sacrilegious to open this&#xD;
before the vulgar gaze of those passing about The house,&#xD;
she ran to her own room, and, when safely locked within,&#xD;
carefully opened the casket, where, displayed to her&#xD;
admiring gaze, was an exquisite set of pearls and dia~&#xD;
monds, elegant enough for the costly and fastidious taste&#xD;
of the then petted and idolized French empress; and&#xD;
with the jewels came 'a tiny card, on which was traced,&#xD;
"For my little darling'"&#xD;
Kissing the card because his hand had pres~d it, she&#xD;
threw herself on the bed, and, placing the package be.'&#xD;
ncath her pillow, soon slept the sleep which comes only&#xD;
to the happy and the innocent.&#xD;

D'~taing Wa~ looked in his room, and looked very&#xD;
1ittl~ like the happy man thd worldmight suppose on th&amp;amp;&#xD;
da&amp;amp; ~f hi~ bi'idal. lie paced ~ floor slowly but im~&#xD;
patiently; his brows were contracted ~y a frown, and it&#xD;
wa~ Ovident he suffe~d acutely from nervofis anxiety.&#xD;
Th~ niorneuts were leaden-winged, ~&#xD;
other; thought that night would never come.&#xD;
Several hinidrCd invitations had been issued to the&#xD;
wedding; and, as it was expected to be th~ most brilliant&#xD;
affair of th~ Sdasoti, the fashionable of the city were&#xD;
tillcd with pleasurabk anticipations. Night, as if to&#xD;
acconinx~date the eagerness of those most nearly interest~&#xD;
ed, closed in almost two hours. earlier than* usual; and&#xD;
amid the clVeiiching~ r~ain which ~Vas falling, and the Egy~&#xD;
tian. darkness which had thrown its midnight veil over&#xD;
Nature, the guests wended their ways to the "ller&#xD;
initage."&#xD;
Driving up the long avenue of live oaks, whose&#xD;
brandies formed the most beautiful Gothic arches, it&#xD;
seemed to Matid as if the long moss, tossed back and&#xD;
forth, and fitfully swayed by the storm, sobbed and&#xD;
nioaned as though freighted with the refrain of some lost&#xD;
and wailing s~u1, as it floated on the Stygian. Shudder-&#xD;
ingslie drew further back in tho carriage, to shut out&#xD;
those dreary sounds~. Colony\ Jlartridge was silent and&#xD;
abstracted, and but for the sprightly conversation of Kate&#xD;
and her charming escort, Captain Yates, the inmates of&#xD;
that carriage might have been mistaken for pall-bearers&#xD;
rather thftn wedding-guests.&#xD;
The dwelling was brilliantly illuminated, and looked&#xD;
like a palace of fire, shining out of the blackness ~hjch&#xD;
enveloped heaven and eai~th. A large number of guests&#xD;
&#xD;
TilE WEDDII~"G.&#xD;
had already arrived, and the house was soon filled with&#xD;
beautiful women and brave men, whose costumes added&#xD;
a brilliance to the scene.&#xD;
Maud had scarcely entered the cloak-room, when a&#xD;
message came to her from Ruth, desiring her presence.&#xD;
V[ith aching heart and lagging footsteps she nerved hera&#xD;
selt as best she could for, this interview, this fresh ordeal,&#xD;
and entered the chamber of the bride-elect.&#xD;
Panoplied as she was in purity and innocence, her&#xD;
1)ridal robes, in their sheen of satin and frost-work of&#xD;
lace, floating around her like a snowy mist, became her&#xD;
well. She looked, indeed, like a Pen wandering upon&#xD;
this sin-stained earth, and in an earnestness of tone,&#xD;
which betrayed not her heart-ache, Maud exclaimed;&#xD;
"HoW lovelyl" Then, regarding her more closely, she&#xD;
really thought ~he had ~iever seen any creature kaif so&#xD;
angelically beautiful. her entrance and embrace now&#xD;
served to heighten the loveliness of that chambered&#xD;
tableau. The grouping 4 those three contrasting beau-&#xD;
ties would have done credit to the skill and taste of an&#xD;
artist.&#xD;
Mingled with the pride which was revealed in the&#xD;
mother's face, was a tinge of sadness which only a&#xD;
mother's heart can appreciate; for it matters not how&#xD;
willingly, nay, even proudly, she may relinquish her&#xD;
daughter's happiness into the custody of another, though&#xD;
that other be the man of her choice, it is always a sad&#xD;
hour. Women know well what is before their daughters&#xD;
in the relation of marriage, and they know that the duties&#xD;
of wife and mother require an untold amount of patience&#xD;
and endurance, no matter how much love, tenderness, and&#xD;
affection soften the difficult pathway.&#xD;

TIII~ WEDDING.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ekeuse me, will you, for sending for you?" said&#xD;
Ruth, advancing to Maud; "I wish you to pin my veil&#xD;
on;" and at the same time she put up her rose-bud&#xD;
mouth to be kissed.&#xD;
"Certainly, if you desire it; but I am sure your&#xD;
mother can arrange it very much more gracefully than I&#xD;
can; "-and she almost sank under the weight of this&#xD;
new trial.&#xD;
"But I have a particular fancy for having you do it,"&#xD;
replied the wilful, artless child-woman.&#xD;
"A particular fancy" for having her do it! Was the&#xD;
hand of an avenging destiny in all this? Truly, "the&#xD;
way of the transgressor is hard," and the ways of Provi.&#xD;
dence mysterious and "past finding out"!&#xD;
No longer hesitating, ~faud'took up the filmy web of&#xD;
yoint applique , and with trembling fingers arranged it&#xD;
with the wreath of orange-flowers over the glossy hair of&#xD;
the fair bride.&#xD;
As this duty was finished, an agonizing pain darted&#xD;
through her heart, and, turning a pallid white, ~he pressed&#xD;
both hands upon her left side, and, with a groan, sank&#xD;
into the nearest chair.&#xD;
"Heavens! what is the matter?" cried Thith, spring-&#xD;
ing up from before her mirror, and throwing both arms&#xD;
around her for support.&#xD;
"It is nothing, dear Ruth," she gasped; "I am already&#xD;
better "-suppressing a shriek that distorted ]~ier lips.&#xD;
"My physician calls' it neuralgia of the nerves around&#xD;
th~ heart; 1)ut it feels like a knife-blade piercing the&#xD;
heart itself."&#xD;
" But can I do nothing for you? Lie Iown, will&#xD;
you?~~&#xD;

&#xD;
"No, it would not be well for me to lie down; but, 11&#xD;
you have nothing more for me to do, I will seek the air.&#xD;
It is very close in this room, and the perfume of' the&#xD;
flowers is stiflino'"&#xD;
While speaking, she had advanced to the door, and, a~&#xD;
hcr hand turned the bolt, Ruth said, rather reproach.&#xD;
fully,&#xD;
"And you are going.without even a word?"&#xD;
Maud did not answer this remark, and Ruth, coming&#xD;
nearer, put her white, soft arms about her.&#xD;
"Do you not wish me something good?"&#xD;
Tears stood in Maud's eyes. A briny drop sparkled&#xD;
like a diamond on the bridal-veil, and, as she stooped to&#xD;
kiss the white, upturned brow she whispered,&#xD;
"Make him happy."&#xD;
She did not trust herself to say more; but rushed from&#xD;
the room, through Ruth's boudoir, down the wide stair-&#xD;
way, and almost directly against the bridegroom, in her&#xD;
wish to get a breath of air upon her fevered and. aching&#xD;
temples. lie stood in the passage, and, seizing her hands,&#xD;
cried, in evident concern,&#xD;
"how deathly pale you are! Your hands are like&#xD;
ice! Are you ill?"&#xD;
"What matters it if I am ? "~ she gasped, brokenly;&#xD;
"I-only---~-wish I were-dead!" and, nervously extri-&#xD;
cating her imprisoned hands, sh~ flew down a short pd-&#xD;
vate stairway to the back gallery, where the driving wind&#xD;
blew the cold mist in her face and the faintness from her&#xD;
heart. Leaning thei'e upon the railing, in the midst of&#xD;
the storm and darkness, she realized, more keenly than&#xD;
9Ver before, her folly and her wretchedness. The river&#xD;

growling ahd moaning, flow gladly would she at that&#xD;
moment have taken the final plunge, and, beneath those&#xD;
lapsing, gurgling, muttering, sighing, laughing waves,&#xD;
have ended her~ miserable existence!&#xD;
This unhealthy reverie was at length broken by her&#xD;
husband, #ho had ~ought her in almost every room in the&#xD;
house; and, while soothing her by a gentle rebuke, they*&#xD;
followed the crowd that surged in to the front parlor, just&#xD;
as the Right Rev. Bishop began, in tones full of&#xD;
unutterable feeling, the beautiful and appropriate mar-&#xD;
riage ceremonial of the Church of England.&#xD;
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here, in the&#xD;
eight of God and these witnesses, to join together this&#xD;
man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is corn-&#xD;
mended of St. Paul to be honorable among all men; and&#xD;
therefore is not by any to be entered into unadvis~dlyor&#xD;
lightly, but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and&#xD;
iu the fear of God. Into this holy estate these two per..&#xD;
eons come now to be joined. If any. man can show just&#xD;
cause why they may not be lawfully joined together, let&#xD;
him now speak, or else forever hereafter hold his peace."&#xD;
Ther&amp;amp; wa~ a pause; and the nervous dread which is&#xD;
always experienced by the hearers at this portion of the&#xD;
solemn exhortation, lest some one should appear to inter-&#xD;
fere, was j~lainly visible upon the faces of those whp wit-&#xD;
nessed, as they exchanged hastily with one another sur-&#xD;
reptitious and inquiring glances. Suddenly, as a peal of&#xD;
thunder might rumble forth when the noonday sunshine&#xD;
i~ most effulgent, a strange man rushed through the crowd&#xD;
like a madman, and stood by the side of the groom.&#xD;
"11 can show just cause why this man and this woman&#xD;
may not be htwfuily joined together. He i~ a murderer&#xD;
&#xD;
WEDDING.&#xD;
~~-a fugitive from justice!" Thou, turning to two men&#xD;
who had followed him, De V"ere-for he it was-com~&#xD;
manded, "Officers, do your duty!'~&#xD;
It was evident this was a most painful duty to the&#xD;
sheriff; but he, compu~ehending that the ui~ajesty of the&#xD;
law must be sustained at whatever cbst, laid his hand&#xD;
upon the arm of D'Estaing, and said,&#xD;
"By the warrant I hAd in my hand, Mr. D'Estaing, I&#xD;
arrest you.~~&#xD;
"Upon what charge ~" cried D'Estaino' while grim ~&#xD;
terror was writtefl upon every lineament of his face.&#xD;
"Upon the charge of killing one Gustave Delamere;&#xD;
and in obedience to a warrant issued by the Governor of&#xD;
Georgia, on demand made by the Governor of New&#xD;
York, ai~id of which J have the honor to be the bearer,"&#xD;
said the second man, in whom is recognized, as lie held&#xD;
aloft the terrible document, Do Leon.&#xD;
The consternation produced by this interruption c~ui&#xD;
better be imagined than described. Where all but a&#xD;
moment before had been mirth and laughter, wit and&#xD;
brilliant repartee, now reigned teif6r and confusion.&#xD;
Men breathed hard, and women looked the horror that&#xD;
could find no utterance in words. Had God's wrath&#xD;
riven the house in twain, and descended from heaven in&#xD;
a flame of fir~ in their midst, th~ dismay that took posses-&#xD;
sion of the company then as~ernbled could not have been&#xD;
greater. Mr. Leigh, the uncle of Ruth, and upon whose&#xD;
arm she lean~c1, wa~ the first to recover self-possession,&#xD;
andgrasping the arm of Dc Vere, exclaimed,&#xD;
"how dare you ruffians enter this house, and, in the&#xD;

man? Get out! get out! or, by the eternal God, I will&#xD;
8er)d you where you deserve to go!"&#xD;
"The charges are true, sir," calmly replied IDe Leon;&#xD;
"and unless you instantly release IDe Vere, you may have&#xD;
cause to regret it~;" and he drew and pointed a pistol.&#xD;
"Release that man," quietly said iD'Estaing to Mr.&#xD;
Leigh. "Put up your pistol, sir," turning to IDe Leon;&#xD;
"you certainly would not dare to use it, under any cir-&#xD;
cumstances, in this assemblage;" and, with one of hi~&#xD;
courtliest bows, he looked around the room upon the&#xD;
beautiful women and gallant men who had. gathered&#xD;
there, it would seem, to witness his disgrace. A fearful&#xD;
silence then ensued, broken by a whisper from D~ Vere&#xD;
to the sheriff, who, with his hand upon ID'Estaiug, said,&#xD;
"You are my prisoner, Mr. D'Estaing, or Mr. IDela-&#xD;
mere, or whatever name you may go by."&#xD;
"And I regret there is not more time for dramatics, as&#xD;
we must leave by the midnight train for New York,"&#xD;
added IDe Vere.&#xD;
"D'E~taing," cried Mr. Leigh, "hear me!"&#xD;
"For Ruth's sake, say that this horrid charge is false!~~&#xD;
cried the proud mother, above the unuttered words of Mr.&#xD;
Leigh, and sinking at the feet of him she importuned.&#xD;
"It is false! It is false 1" cried Ruth, folding her&#xD;
arms around him, as if to stay the hand outstretched for&#xD;
his ruin; while her bloodless brow was knitted, and her&#xD;
mild eyes, as stony as the stony eyes of Kiobo, glared&#xD;
around in the sublime strength of virtuous indignation.&#xD;
A very Pythoness seemed this soft, yielding, mirthful&#xD;
girl, throwing the shield of her protection pver the form&#xD;
of her lover, even as she knelt beside lii~ and clutched&#xD;
his knees. "Who are you, that dare to bring this foul&#xD;
&#xD;
accusation? Who are you, that would brand a spoties~&#xD;
name with crime ~ Base hirelings, begone!"&#xD;
Do Yore's mustache curled with the sardonic smile that&#xD;
played over his lips, and a gleam of cowardly triumph&#xD;
glisf cued in the cold, snaky eyes of D~ Leon. Deep&#xD;
sighs were heard, and an occasional sob burst over the&#xD;
apartment, but the master-feeling which ran through the&#xD;
witnesses to this spectacle was one of mute surprise and&#xD;
speechless horror.&#xD;
"My friends," said the Bishop, his hand still clasping&#xD;
the open prayer-book, "we have been strangely interrupt-&#xD;
ed. I dare not proceed. May God in lli~ wisdom and&#xD;
mercy soon annul this foul charge made against 'our&#xD;
friend Mr. D'Estaing, while lie tempers the wind to this&#xD;
poor, stricken lamb;" and, with an unuttered benedic-&#xD;
tion, lie laid his hands on the heads of both Ruth and&#xD;
D'Estaing.&#xD;
But D'Estaing neither moved nor spoke; no, not even&#xD;
to return poor Ruth's embrace. Like one petrified, he&#xD;
gazed into the face of the sheriff, a cold sipile wreathing&#xD;
his fine mouth, and a cold gleam, hard and chilling as&#xD;
ice, glimmered from his eyes.&#xD;
By this time certain of the women wept frantic, hyster-&#xD;
ical tears, that shook their nerves like a prolonged and&#xD;
powerful galvanic thrill, and made them as powerless as&#xD;
infants.&#xD;
Making his way through the crowd, Colonel Uartridge&#xD;
stood beside D'Estaing. There was infinite indignation&#xD;
in his glance, and a hard, metallic ring in his voice, as he&#xD;
said something to the man who held the warrant; and&#xD;
then, turning to his friend, said,&#xD;
"JYEstaing, are the charges true?"&#xD;

25~               THE WEDDING.&#xD;
- ~.v ~ ..&#xD;
His ~v6rd~, though few, were so replete with anguish5&#xD;
they sent a thrill of horror darting through every heart&#xD;
in the room-a thrill that surcharge in a universal wai&#xD;
of indignant sorrow as he locked his arms about him,&#xD;
over the bowed head of poor Ruth, and shook with the&#xD;
emotion of a gr~t, manly nature.&#xD;
But this touching act of friendship was rudely inter.&#xD;
erupted by the impatience of the law, the sheriff inform-&#xD;
ing him they had no time to lose. By a superhuman&#xD;
effort, D'Estaing' conquered himself. Lifting Ruth, he&#xD;
drew her head on his bosom, and kissed her cold, quiver-&#xD;
ing lips; then, grasping Jiartridge's. hand warmly, with&#xD;
the 1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;uteur peculiar to his 'air and bearing, he turned to&#xD;
the sheriff, and said:&#xD;
"I aTh ready. Do with me according to the law."&#xD;
At the~e words Ruth shrieked, and fell, as if dead, at&#xD;
his feet. Stooping, and gently raising her, he pressed her&#xD;
'convuulsively to his bosom, kissed her again and again&#xD;
with a tenderness born on the instant, and, while she was&#xD;
still insensible, laid her in her mother's arms, and fol-&#xD;
lowed those commissiond to take him in custody.&#xD;
It would have 1)een more than strange if imo recollec.&#xD;
tioi~, even then, had come back to him of the time when&#xD;
he had seen the wedding-robei~ of another bride bedab-&#xD;
bled in her husband's blood. "Vengeance is mine; I&#xD;
will repay, saidi the Lord;" and in his own good time&#xD;
and way He had seen it proper to do so.&#xD;
Another spectator to this terrible scene must not be&#xD;
forgotten,, for she, too, ~Va~ a s~iff~rer. As D'Estaiug and&#xD;
his captors walked slowly from the room, Mau4~ fell for.&#xD;
ward in a swoon, and those of ~tho wedding-guests who&#xD;
were not engaged in ~oothing Ruth and her mother, no~v&#xD;

THE WEDDTh~G.&#xD;

clustered arocmnd her, to apply restoratives, without si~s~&#xD;
eatingg the real secret of her emotion. In, a little while&#xD;
the larger portion of the gay crowd who had gathered&#xD;
to the nuptials had dispersed to their several homes-the&#xD;
wedding-feast untouched, the wine freezing in the ices,&#xD;
the fruits decaying in their lusciousness, the flowers with-&#xD;
ering in the gas-light, and the sweetmeats neglected for&#xD;
palates to test their perfection.&#xD;
In the grove near by, ]3onnetheau, the wretch who&#xD;
should have filled a murderer's and felon's grave, and&#xD;
who had been the direct cause of this strangely terrible&#xD;
and disgraceful scene, having been afraid to show him-&#xD;
self, joined the party in the darkness, under a feigned&#xD;
name, amid, entering a carriage, they arrived in the city&#xD;
just in time to take the midnight train going North.&#xD;
At that hour the "IIer4~i~tage" presented a strangely&#xD;
contrasting picture to thatT of the early evening. The&#xD;
lights burned low; a few women-kind friends of Ruth&#xD;
and her mother-with their ever-watchful, ever-faithful&#xD;
servants, walked on tip-toe and whispered as if they had&#xD;
been ~Vatching b'~ the cough of death; and the night&#xD;
~1&#xD;
dragged its w'~ary~ lemi~tli to~ ards the dawn, a~ Kate and&#xD;
Coloimel Ilartritlge sat bbndiug anxiously over the sofa&#xD;
upon which iMlaud was lying. She had recoveai~ed from&#xD;

letliar~y, utterii ig occasional incoherent mutterings, and&#xD;
startiiig 110W and then fitfully, as from a fever-dream. In&#xD;

ahnos~ a bride, decked in her sacrificial garments-the&#xD;
rich satin robe crushed and wrinkled, and the costly lace&#xD;

near by, a private sanctuary, in which she was wont to&#xD;
pour 6ut the deepest and tenderest orisons that were born&#xD;
in her soul, over a worn and well-used Bible the mother&#xD;
knelt, and cried out in strong prayers and tears for help,&#xD;
for strength; for resignation to every event of Provi..&#xD;
dence; for meekness under every stroke of His auger;&#xD;
for submission to his will; for wisdom to guide and com-&#xD;

trees, and the sun's first rays gilded the leaflets of the&#xD;
sturdy live oaks, and lighted up into myriads of. crystals&#xD;
the rain-drops which clung to evei~y leaf and- blade of&#xD;

and daughter, clasped in each other's arms, knelt and&#xD;
prayed 'together, and wept, and were in a measure&#xD;
strengthened. And, many. miles distant, the shrill shriek&#xD;
of a railroad-whistle aroused the slumbering passengers,&#xD;

for a while this beautiful "kingdom&#xD;
this "ghoul-haunted woodland of&#xD;
~wYeir," with all its charms and recollections, the&#xD;
reader will be transported to New York, "the great me-&#xD;
tropolis" of America. his business, however, is not&#xD;
with the gay promenaders on Fifth Avenue or Broadway,&#xD;
nor yet with the pleasure -seekers in~ Central Park, nor&#xD;
among the butterflies of fashion in any one of their cho-&#xD;
sen haunts, but with one whom God and man seem crn~&#xD;
elly to have forsaken.&#xD;
Finding himself on Centm~e street, away where the bus-&#xD;
tie and din of the more thronged portions of the city&#xD;
surge up like the roar of the ocean in the swelling of a&#xD;
storm, a dark, gloomy edifice looms up menacingly, fore-&#xD;
bodingly, before him; lie shudders as he stands beneath&#xD;
its overwhelming portico, knowing that he is about to&#xD;
enter that far-famed prison portentously called "The&#xD;
Tombs." The name is significant, whether iii reference&#xD;
to the moral death of its usual imnates, or their virtual&#xD;
burial from all that is bright amid beautiful on this lovely,&#xD;
God-made earth. The wretch incarccratcd in "The&#xD;
Tombs" may sn~ile in derision at the massive walls, the&#xD;
narrow, grated windows, th~ iron doors; but, with all hjs&#xD;
bravado, he feels dead to the life of niisuispectcd inno-&#xD;
cence in the past, and buried to all hope of an unsuspcet~&#xD;
ed social status in the future. here, vice and - depravity&#xD;
hold high carnival, with an occasional wincing under the&#xD;

tinges of remorse, and the speculation as to how this&#xD;
unhappy d6rnn~memt might have, been avoided. Yet, to&#xD;
ths place sympathy is not a stranger, ~hoi~gh its presence&#xD;
is more frequently provoked by a mortifying sense of the&#xD;
feebleness of human virtue and the strength of human&#xD;
depravity.&#xD;
having entered the cumbrous portal, one shiveringly&#xD;
crosses the open court, in which is' raised, when the need&#xD;
,requires, the dreadful tree of expiation, then enters an-&#xD;
other iron-barred and bolted door, and scarcely a footfall&#xD;
is heard as he glides along the dark, damp corridors, until&#xD;
a cell is reached, in which, if his heart is not made of&#xD;
stone, it must bleed for the occupant. lie does not&#xD;
belong to the class in which crime is born, like the inher-&#xD;
ited cancers. Gentle blood courses his veins, and the&#xD;
stamp of aristocratic birth rests utpon his iioble features.&#xD;
Lying at full length upon a miserable cot, his air is that&#xD;
of utter dejection-a hopelessness which shuts out all&#xD;
light, all life, all beauty. His complexion is pallid to&#xD;
ghastliness, and the deep, dark circles around hi~ eyes&#xD;
tell, more plainly thart w6rds, 'how terribly he has suf-&#xD;
fered.&#xD;
It has been only ten days since his Wedding-night, and&#xD;
he still wears his bridal-suit, the same in which he was&#xD;
arrested; but his dress is in utter disorder, and, with his&#xD;
dishevelled hair, shows that he has forgotten the selfish&#xD;
care of the person in the lightning-blast which has strick-&#xD;
en him down, and shivered his fondest hopes into atoms.&#xD;
Sigh after sigh, laden with thQ expression of his mis~&#xD;
cry, escapes him, and makes his gloomy cell still gloomier'&#xD;
in their echoless sound-for small echo have narrow chain-&#xD;
hers with* dense ,stone walls. S~gh'afte~ sigh, as rnen3o~y&#xD;

IN TIlE ~ TOMB5.~&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
dwells upon those dragged down by, and with, and&#xD;
through him, whose happiness he has forever blighted.&#xD;
lie may be called the cause, though in a measure inno~&#xD;
cent, of all the suffering with which he reproaches him-&#xD;
self; for had he not abandoned the world, disdained its&#xD;
necessary conventionalisms, and affected to despise the&#xD;
needful restraints which are imposed on society and man-&#xD;
kind?&#xD;
But "they would not let me rest," he said frequently&#xD;
to himself, by way of palliation. "Even when I fancied&#xD;
myself most secure from intrusion, my retreat was&#xD;
invaded, and I lured again and again into those haunts&#xD;
for which I was so well fitted, and from which I was at&#xD;
last driven by the assassin's hand." -&#xD;
Thus he continued to think, and sought to derive some&#xD;
consolation from what took to him the form of inevitable&#xD;
destiny.&#xD;
But if men excuse themselves for all their misdemean-&#xD;
ors on the plea of fatality, will they be excused by the&#xD;
Judge of quick and dead in the last great day? Thp&#xD;
hope is like an autumn leaf driven by the hurricane;&#xD;
and just so surely as that leaf is driven where it would'&#xD;
not by the relentless storm, will such a hope come to&#xD;
naught.&#xD;
Man has Moses and the prophets, Christ and the apos~&#xD;
tles; then why prate of fate and destiny?&#xD;
D'Estaing was neither a~i infidel nor an atheist, but he&#xD;
belonged to the popular school of infidelity which the&#xD;
P~ev. iobert hall has so elaborately considered and&#xD;
whose sermon on that, subject it would be well. for all to&#xD;
read and study who would wrest the words of Christ from'&#xD;
merely idle speculation.&#xD;

Every one knows-and with pain be it written-, that it&#xD;
has become quite the fashion, in these latter days, to scoff&#xD;
and sneer at religion, as something of which a well-bal-&#xD;
anced judgment should be ashamed.&#xD;
Knowing this, as all right-thinking persons do, should&#xD;
it not be the duty of every good and true citizen to put&#xD;
down all such attempts, since religion is the foundation&#xD;
of virtue and~ the strongest support of society; the friend&#xD;
of the helpless; the sacred guardian of the marriage&#xD;
rite; the faithful sentinel upon the light-house, that,&#xD;
decrying dander, gives the alarm, and then throws its&#xD;
protecting arms around the weary and the doubtful?&#xD;
Then should not every man endeavor, by all the means&#xD;
within his power, to perpetuate and spread this holy influ-&#xD;
ence, this life-giving principle, to all that is good and&#xD;
great; while he prays for more faith to practise what ho&#xD;
professes, that he may not be a stumbling-block in the&#xD;
way of the timid and unbelieving? In the words of&#xD;
Lord Bacon, let it ever be remembered, that "religion is&#xD;
the only thing that can teach temperance in prosperity or&#xD;
heroism in adversity."&#xD;
What an illustration of these precepts was D'Estaino'?&#xD;
Deprived at an early age of his natural protectors, and&#xD;
left to the training' of those who professed Christ only*&#xD;
b&#xD;
through a formula which has in it little of the true doc-&#xD;
trines of Christianity, he is to be pitied~ perhaps, rather&#xD;
than censured. Alas! it seems much easier to withhold&#xD;
pity, than censure; and, in the solitude of his cell,&#xD;
D'Estaing felt the full force of this perversion of human-&#xD;
ity from natural good.&#xD;
Without the influence of any divine teaching instilled&#xD;
into his youthful heart, he had given unbridled license to&#xD;
&#xD;
Di TIlE ~TOMB5~~&#xD;
&#xD;
265&#xD;
&#xD;
his passions, and they had led him first into revenge, and&#xD;
then. into the indulgence of a love which his honor for~&#xD;
bade, 14~t which honor alone could not restrain.&#xD;
In a felon's cell, believing himself forsaken by man&#xD;
and forgotten by God, crushed beneath the load of guilt&#xD;
that his own conduct had brought upon his soul, in the&#xD;
Cimmerian mental darkness which enveloped him, one&#xD;
little spark of hope had irradiated his heart for a brief&#xD;
moment; and that hope was, that his kind-hearted guar-&#xD;
dian would extricate him, if possible. That hope, how-&#xD;
ever, was doomed to perish with the breath that gave it&#xD;
life. Upon inquiry, he was filled with pain to discover&#xD;
that his guardian had closed his business in New York,&#xD;
and had gone abroad for an indefinite lengtl4 of time, and&#xD;
that no one could give his address.&#xD;
But why did he wish to live? To what part of the&#xD;
broad universe did he think to fly to escape the living&#xD;
death which burned within his scorched and seared&#xD;
breast?&#xD;
It was the thraldom of this feeling which made him&#xD;
fear to die; and yet, groping as he was in the "valley of&#xD;
the shadow of death," he still trifled with the interests of&#xD;
his immortal soul, and bade defiance to God and His laws.&#xD;
Misfortunes proverbially soften or harden; and D'Es-&#xD;
taino' wa~ fast coming under the latter unhappy proces~.&#xD;
Then, as~ waking days and sleepless nights rolled by, he&#xD;
asked himself continually, "Why was II born, or why so&#xD;
cruel a destiny allotted to me?"&#xD;
The air, as it stole in through the heavy grating, an-&#xD;
swered not; there was no reply in the echoless regions&#xD;
around him, and* none came from his dulled and be.&#xD;
numbed conscience.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
A DESEI~TED HOME.&#xD;
a darkened chamber, a woman lay ill unto&#xD;
death. Unconscious of pain, the delirium which&#xD;
~ locked her reason was happiness; for, in the fan.&#xD;
tastic visions which it fed, there came to her "the days"&#xD;
that were "no more." Again they met, never more to be&#xD;
parted; together, far over the seas, they wandered in&#xD;
sunny and poetic climes, where even the air was laden&#xD;
with love; where the flowers breathed it; where the&#xD;
moonbeams nourished it; where the stars whispered it;&#xD;
where fountains gurgled it; where the birds, as they nes-&#xD;
tled beneath the broad lush leaves of the beauty-laden&#xD;
tropics, sang it, and lived in it.&#xD;
Ecstatic happiness! Infinite bliss! Would that those&#xD;
dreams could have had some semblance in reality, or that&#xD;
from them the soul of the dreamer might have winged&#xD;
its flight to those regions where man is taught to* look for&#xD;
*     the re~liz~tion of all his ideal perfection, whether of&#xD;
beauty, ~ of the impulses which govern~ existence. But&#xD;
it was not so. That blessed abode is only attained&#xD;
~through the tribulation which purifies and refines lil:e the&#xD;
goldsmith's crucible.&#xD;
For three weeks Maud had dwelt in the fictitions&#xD;
£&#xD;
realms which grow up in the fevered brain, dulling ti~&#xD;
edgQ of sorrow, the point of pain, and peopling the sidk-.&#xD;
cha~nber with angels. Anon, she had roamed through&#xD;
shadows, and life and death contended together in every&#xD;
slender vein and pulsing artery that coursed her frames&#xD;
&#xD;
But, as often before, when the monster brandishes hig&#xD;
well-whetted sickle, he had been thrust aside, for the&#xD;
wheat was not yet ripe, and the tender blade was to sinilo&#xD;
again in the life-giving sunlight; though, torn by the&#xD;
blast and wrenched by the whirlwind, it gladly would&#xD;
have courted the cutting down.&#xD;
She recovered slowly, and lived on brokenly. There&#xD;
was a purpose in this. God in his infinite mercy hid&#xD;
that purpose from human ken; but it was His, and in&#xD;
his own season lie fulfilled it.&#xD;
Kate looked pale and weary and haggard from long&#xD;
watching; and a deep grief had settled on her heart,&#xD;
as the revelations by the sufferer's side opened fresh pages&#xD;
of life's miseries, and gave the impress of added years to&#xD;
her mien and deportment.&#xD;
Since the contre-tem23 of that fatal wedding-night,&#xD;
little else had been talked of in the Forest City. INo&#xD;
such sensation had ever been created in its social world&#xD;
before; and in the hearts of the good and pious, "Ileaw&#xD;
en graht that such an affair may never occur again," was&#xD;
the solemn ejaculation. A gloom had been cast over the&#xD;
community which seemed unlikely to be soon dispelled.&#xD;
Old women, devoured by nursery recollections and absurd&#xD;
superstitions, said they "knew it," "when people would&#xD;
defy all signs, and wed in such a storm as was 'on that&#xD;
dreary, jet-black night." Good and honest men ~lmook&#xD;
their heads, and declared "it was a very sad affair-very!&#xD;
very!" And some, less disposed to be generous, hugged&#xD;
sweet satisfaction to their narrow souls, and avowed they&#xD;

268              A DESERTED HOME.&#xD;
&#xD;
And so the winds of rumor, and scandal, and infer&#xD;
ence, and supposition, whispered or raged to little corn&#xD;
fort.for those most nearly concerned.&#xD;
And this one topic proved much more than "a nine&#xD;
days' wonder" to the itching ears and lashing tongues of&#xD;
the inhabitants, big and little, old and young; and all the&#xD;
1whule Time, like a river which knows no receding flow,&#xD;
rolled silently on, full-f;eighted, to the vast sea of Eter-&#xD;
nity.&#xD;
Amid the deep moxtiflcation consequent upon the&#xD;
unhappy frustratkn of IRuth's wedding, Mrs. Leigh had&#xD;
sailed for Europe-some said "never to return." Many&#xD;
conjectures were ventured in refei~ence to Maud's illness,&#xD;
but, on account of the high social position of her hus-&#xD;
band and self, suspicions found voice only in whispers.&#xD;
&#xD;
The sun was sinking, and the bracing air of a cool&#xD;
December evening quickened the steps of pedestrians as&#xD;
they sought their respective homes. I(ate sat in the em-&#xD;
brasure of an oriel window which commanded a view of&#xD;
the Pulaski monument and Forsyth Place;~ and many&#xD;
were the familiar faces upon which she looked down from&#xD;
her hiding-place, "linking fancy unto fancy," or calling&#xD;
~p froimi memory scenes and associations which did not&#xD;
trouble the ordinary c~iannel of her thoughts. - The satin&#xD;
damask curtaimis were drawn, but. did n9t prevent a deep&#xD;
groan from rcachhig her quick ear. Springing up, in an&#xD;
instant she was at the bedside of the sufferer, and asked,&#xD;
in the tonderest accents,&#xD;
"What is it, dear?"&#xD;
"Kate!"&#xD;
"Yes, dear; I am 1iei~e. What will you V'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Kate!" again whispered the weak, faltering voice,&#xD;
but said no more.&#xD;
"What do you wish, my dear?" said Kate, anxiously,&#xD;
as she knelt by the bedside, and slipped one arm undei&#xD;
the head of Thud.&#xD;
Then, as if by a sudden effort-yea, almost by forco-&#xD;
she asked,&#xD;
"Where is my husband ?"'&#xD;
Kate feared this. She trembled so that Maud felt tho&#xD;
thrill, and, almost gasping for breath, replied,&#xD;
"lie will be home by and by. Don't worry yourself&#xD;
about him.'~.&#xD;
"how many days ~hc it been, Kate, dear,? Three&#xD;
fouy, live "-counting them on her thin, pale fingers-&#xD;
"and he has not been near me! Why is this?"&#xD;
"Tie has be~en near you," said Kate; warmly, and&#xD;
blushing scarlet, she averted her face.&#xD;
"has been !-but-is-----not now! What~ is the mat-&#xD;
ter? What keeps him from me? Why does he not&#xD;
come, Elate?" she asked again, with apprehension in her&#xD;
But Kate did not answer her questions, and looked so&#xD;
confused, that what had been the most harrowing sus-&#xD;
picions since her husband's protracted absence began&#xD;
now, in Maud's mind, to assume the form of some terrb&#xD;
lAo reality. Was it the consciousness of having done him&#xD;
a great wrong that filled her mind with fears mingled&#xD;
with dread? Who can doubt it? Self-accusing moments&#xD;
come to every one; and if, in those honest hours, men&#xD;
would humble themselves in the dust, and ask for guide&#xD;
arice of God, they might in future years 100k back to&#xD;
their dark days as clouds which hide "the silver lining."&#xD;

A DESERTED hOME.&#xD;
&#xD;
The silence had grown painful, and Maud, raising her.&#xD;
s44f on her elbow, determined to know the worst.&#xD;
"Kate, you are unnecessarily embarrassed. What is&#xD;
the cause of it?"&#xD;
"Nothing," ~said Kate, with a sigh.&#xD;
"You are concealing something from me, I fear. Pray&#xD;
do not keep me in suspense. I have borne much; 1~ can&#xD;
bear yet much more. Tell meif you know, where my&#xD;
husband is."&#xD;
Her voice was calm, but her pulse throbbed wildly,&#xD;
and still Kate knelt by her side with bowed head, and&#xD;
made no reply.&#xD;
To be the bearer of ill news is ever, to the sensitive&#xD;
mind, a most revolting task, and one from which even the&#xD;
hardened are wont to shrink, unless there is pleasure&#xD;
found in the tortures of the rack; but life imposes pains&#xD;
as well as pleasures; and the true and good dare not&#xD;
sometimes falter in the performance of duty, when it&#xD;
requires the excision of a nerve, the probe, or scalpel,&#xD;
simply because of their nervous sympathy.&#xD;
"Kate; why are you silent?" said Maud.&#xD;
At last, fully realizing tl~at silence was no longer either&#xD;
possihie or merciful, Kate raised her head, and said,&#xD;
deprc~atingly:&#xD;
"Maud, dear, I have a letter f~r you."&#xD;
"A letter!" cried Maud, again raising herself in her&#xD;
bed ; "give it me! Quick! quick, Kate! A letter?"&#xD;
Taking it from her pocket, she placed it in eagei',&#xD;
tre~nbling hands, and, not wishing to be a witness to the&#xD;
coining agony of her friend, turned and left the room.&#xD;
She suspected, although she did not know, the contents&#xD;

as I would. You have forfeited tour right to that con&#xD;
sideration. During your illness, you have made, in&#xD;
delirium, such disclosures as will render it impossible for&#xD;
us ever to live together again as man. and wife. If I&#xD;
have not been as demonstrative as others, my manner, and&#xD;
not my heart, was in fault. God in heaven knows how&#xD;
deeply I have loved you. I do not censure, for I am&#xD;
aware I am neither attractive nor fascinating; but to ren~&#xD;

are blameless; but this sudden awakening from perfect&#xD;
security, and what Ii fancied was happiness, has undone&#xD;
me. In the hands of Mr. Broughton I have left a sufi[&#xD;

you live. The home in which I thought myself among&#xD;

As she finished reading, the note dropped from her&#xD;
lingers; bcad~d drops of cold perspiration stood upon her&#xD;
temples, and her teeth chattered in her month.&#xD;
"if I could have seen him but ~ne moment," she said&#xD;
to herself, "I could have told him all-hog I suffered-~&#xD;

But it was too late. She was as utterly alone as a&#xD;
wrecked mariner on the smallest isle in mid-ocean. God&#xD;
alone knew whether they should ever meet again, and her&#xD;
sighs and tears He alone took account of.&#xD;
Several hours dragged their slow length along. As she&#xD;
lay there, sobbing hysterically, her penitence was worthy&#xD;
of the cause which called it forth.&#xD;
But love is stronger than revenge, inasmuch as it en~&#xD;
twines within it the blessed promptings of piety; and&#xD;
soon her thot!ghts, untrammeled by discretion, ran out to&#xD;
~the one who at that moment languished in a dungeon.&#xD;
Did she love him still, with the crime of a homicide&#xD;
clinging to his soul? Aye, and more tenderly, in the&#xD;
very waywardness of woman's nature, than ever! Ilad&#xD;
&amp;amp;he no pride? Pride is insane beside the strength of&#xD;
woman's love-such love as Maud's, that would fatten&#xD;
even on the vapors of disgrace. It mattered not; she&#xD;
loved him, though the gyves and manacles were the jew-&#xD;
elry that clanked on his wrists and ankles. She loved&#xD;
him then; she would love him till her latest breath.&#xD;
Toward midnight, Kate entered Mand's chamber to&#xD;
resume her post as watcher, but they exchanged not a&#xD;
single word. To each the past was a closed book.&#xD;
By strictly ~following the directions of her physician,&#xD;
MIaud's health improved more rapidly than could have&#xD;
been expected; so that, at the expiration of two weeks,&#xD;
she sat up, and, with the assistance of Kate's supporting&#xD;
arm, walked about her husband's beautiful and forsaken&#xD;
home.&#xD;
Kate's love, kindness, and sympathy shone out to he3&#xD;

A. SCENE IN THE C0URT~R00M.&#xD;
like stars in the midnight of her woe; but no confidences&#xD;
were exchanged, and a melancholy, which seemed too&#xD;
heavy to break, settled on both of these bright young&#xD;
women.&#xD;
Two weeks later, at the darkest hour of the night, a&#xD;
muffled figure might have been seen stealthily leaving&#xD;
that house. The silence of the hour was scarcely broken&#xD;
by the soft tread; and, taking a carriage, the disguised&#xD;
figure was driven rapidly to the nearest station of the&#xD;
Central Railroad, while little thought was given to the&#xD;
deserted house left behind in the gloom of night.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
A. SCENE IN THE COURT-ROOM.&#xD;
ALE and haggard, but still beautiful, ~faud&#xD;
attracted more than usual attention as she&#xD;
walked hastily along the crowded thoroughfares&#xD;
of New York. Totally unconscious of the admiring&#xD;
glances which were bent upon her, her every thought wa~&#xD;
of one who lay immured within the walls of a dungeon;&#xD;
and how to gain access to him, puzzled, her brain, until&#xD;
she was almost crazed. Having arrived in this great&#xD;
metropolis the day before, she considered herself £ortm.&#xD;
nate in seciiiring board very near the prison. Why she&#xD;
congratulated herself upon this circumstance, is still a&#xD;
mystery, for, in reality, it brought her no nearer the&#xD;
object of her search.&#xD;

~1~4        A 5O~H rn TH~ OOU3T~'3OOM~&#xD;
desolation be imagined? In the solitude of the primeval&#xD;
forests, isolation would not have been more complete;&#xD;
but Maud's world now consisted of her thoughts alone,&#xD;
and they were confined, as is, already known, to one soli-&#xD;
tary being~.. An insane desire to rescue him from the&#xD;
hrn~ribIe fate which evil presentiments forced upon her&#xD;
excited imagination, had taken possession of all her facul-&#xD;
ties. How to do it, or in what manner to proceed, had&#xD;
not yet been developed. In one of those mad impulses&#xD;
which sometimes urge both men and women to deeds&#xD;
before undreamed of, she had abandoned friends, and&#xD;
home, and yielded to the blind dictates of a guilty pas-&#xD;
sion, which had brought only misery in the past, and&#xD;
which her heart told her too surely would bring ruin in&#xD;
the future. Who can account for such infatuation?&#xD;
And where it shall end, who is prophet enough to pre-&#xD;
dict?&#xD;
Sitting in her room, which commanded a view of the&#xD;
prison, she had done absolutely nothing but watch the&#xD;
g~boomy building which held 'the object of her thoughts.&#xD;
Once she had ventured to walk past it; then, as if acci-&#xD;
dentally entering into a conversation witli a policeman,&#xD;
* 'she learned, to her sorrow, that no one was allowed to see&#xD;
him.&#xD;
It was the day of his trial,' and with beating heart she&#xD;
read the announcement in. the morning papers. An&#xD;
intense excitement prevailed throughout the city. Every&#xD;
~v~nue leading~o the old Court-House on Chambers&#xD;
street was blockaded with people and vehicles; and as&#xD;
the living stream still poured in that direction, iMlaud was&#xD;
carried along with it, until she was in danger of being&#xD;
eri~shad.&#xD;
&#xD;
It had been noised abroad that the Prosecuting party&#xD;
would attend t~ie trial en~ mct&amp;amp;~e, and a vulgar curiosity,&#xD;
common to the human race, assembled a large concourse&#xD;
of people in the Temple of Justice that morning. Halls,&#xD;
galleries, 'stairways, and windows were packed with ~a liv-&#xD;
ing, breathing hiass. Iflut IMlaud's heart sank, as a neigh.&#xD;
boring clock told the hour of eleven, and the entrance&#xD;
was as far off as it had been an hour previous. The trial&#xD;
was announced to begin at ten; and while she was&#xD;
indulging these thoughts, the jury filed in and took their&#xD;
seats, and all eyes were turned upon the prisoner, who&#xD;
entered at the same hioment. For some reason not&#xD;
divulged, D'Estaing had persistently refused to employ&#xD;
counsel, although he knew that in the hands of his guar-&#xD;
d~an he must have an. ample fortune. Hence, counsel&#xD;
had been assigned him by the State, which thereby&#xD;
proved its desire to be merciful as well as just. his&#xD;
defenders had visited and consulted with him, but his&#xD;
statements were meagre, the conferences unsatisfactory,&#xD;
and their interest in him not what it might have been&#xD;
under different circumstances.&#xD;
lie was pale ~nd haggard, but bore with calmness the&#xD;
storm of glances that were levelled at him as he took the&#xD;
appointed seat. The case was called, and, just as the&#xD;
charge was about ~to be read, there was a sudden cra~i-~--&#xD;
the girder that supported the gallery snapped in twain,&#xD;
and its pi'ecious freight of hundreds of human souls was&#xD;
precipitated on to the floor of the court-roon~ below, all&#xD;
of which gave way, carrying within its last embrace the&#xD;
eager, curious beings who ~i~d gathered tkere to look on&#xD;
the misery of one of their fellow~creatures.v&#xD;

K                   A SCENE IN THE OOURT-EOOM.&#xD;
&#xD;
Great God! what a day of horror of misery, of woe,&#xD;
of untold wretchedness, was that!&#xD;
it was done so quickly that no one at first comprehend.&#xD;
ed what had occurred. iMlaud was now 'within the hall&#xD;
which led to the court-room, but a blinding, suffocating&#xD;
dust was all that she was conscious of, until some one&#xD;
near her said,&#xD;
"Great God! the court-room has fallen in!"&#xD;
She did not shriek or faint, but went with all haste to&#xD;
one of the doors of the gallery. As she stood on the&#xD;
brink of destruction, looking doWn upon the mangled,&#xD;
bleeding, dying beings in the pit below, an insane desire&#xD;
to cast herself into their midst and end her wretchedness&#xD;
came over her. The temptation grew stronger each min-&#xD;
ute, and, but for a kind-hearted fireman, might have been&#xD;
put into execution. Jerking her back, he said,&#xD;
"See, the floor is giving way under your feet!"&#xD;
"It matters not."&#xD;
"Would you kill yourself?"&#xD;
"I would."&#xD;
"Have you friends there ?"&#xD;
" One."&#xD;
"Come to the square, then, where they are making&#xD;
preparations to extricate the bodies, and perhaps you will&#xD;
lind him."&#xD;
Following this strange man out on to the square, a&#xD;
scene met her eyes which baffles description. Fire-bells&#xD;
were ringing, church-bells were tolling, the firemen&#xD;
those ~gallant fellows, who are ever foremost in the ranks&#xD;
of dariger-were busy in their efforts to relieve the suffer-&#xD;
ors; the military and police were doing all that human&#xD;
power could do; mothers* sisters, wives, and children,&#xD;
&#xD;
A SCENE IN THE COU3T-ROOM.&#xD;
rent the air with their shrieks; fathers, sons, and broth.&#xD;
ers hurried to and fro in a manner which betokened&#xD;
frenzy and despair; and the final day will scarcely be&#xD;
fraught with more horror, when the last farewells are&#xD;
spoken, and the greedy flames clasp in their cruel em,&#xD;
brace the forms of loved ones, and take them from 'sight&#xD;
forever.&#xD;
Standing near the spot where the bodies were swung&#xD;
down, Maud saw the disappointment of relatives when&#xD;
the missing one came not to greet their streaming eyes.&#xD;
11cr sympathetic heart was touched, and the tears, which&#xD;
had refused to flow for the last month, now came to her&#xD;
relief.&#xD;
While this scene was being enacted outside, the tragedy&#xD;
was deepening within that pit of human slaughter. The*&#xD;
dust from the plastering was blinding, and no man could&#xD;
recognize his neighbor. The groans of, the wounded and&#xD;
the prayers of the dying were enough to have melted&#xD;
hearts of stone; and the refinement of cruelty was there&#xD;
exemplified, for iio man could assist himself or help his&#xD;
friends. The timbers were still creaking and crashing,&#xD;
and the consternation increased with each moment, as&#xD;
minutes lengthened into hours, and so many, who might&#xD;
have been saved, died for want of time and assistance.&#xD;
At length, from out that chaotic mass of ddlris, a voico&#xD;
caine as from the dead, and said,&#xD;
"My friend, can you move a little?"&#xD;
"Heavens! that voice!" exclaimed D'Estaing~&#xD;
"My God! Delamere, is it you?"&#xD;
"it is Bonuethean; and I cannot i~ove hand or foot,&#xD;
for a beam has fallen across me."&#xD;
Thus these two men, persecutor and victim, were equal&#xD;

at last, for death equalizes all mankind. They wouki&#xD;
have been more than human not to have thought of the&#xD;
past; and to their honor be it recorded, that all animosity&#xD;
'vvas forgotten. D'Estaing bore no malice; aiid as il3onne-&#xD;
thean fclt that his last hour was approaching, he said,&#xD;
penitently, and in a weak voice,&#xD;
"~Can you forgive me?"&#xD;
"IL can, and do; and may God forgive you as freely&#xD;
and fully!" was the quick response.&#xD;
"That-4s-too much-to-expect 1" said l3onnetheau,&#xD;
in broken accents. Then, after a littTh while, he said,&#xD;
feebly, "Farewell!" and no more was heard of him until&#xD;
his name was announced among the dead.&#xD;
D'Estaing had received some slight wounds, but, in the&#xD;
excitement of the hour, was not aware of it. At length,&#xD;
however,,he turned deathly ~ick, and soon after fainted&#xD;
from physical exhaustion and loss of blood.&#xD;
For hours Maud stood upon the greensward watching&#xD;
this terrible tragedy in all its sickening detail, and still&#xD;
she watched and waited until the day was gone and night&#xD;
came on, and still the form she sought was missing. At&#xD;
last, anxiety, suffering, hunger, fatigue, thirst, and sleep-&#xD;
lessness conquered, and she fell fainting upon the square.&#xD;
&#xD;
Awaking to consciousness~ several hours afterwards, sh~&#xD;
found herself in one of those blest abodes where veiled&#xD;
~vonien move softly around doing good. The walls of the&#xD;
little room were white as purity itself,, and thorough neat-&#xD;
ness was written upon all its simple appointxnznts. It&#xD;
was near midnight, and a shaded lamp threw a subdued&#xD;
light over everything, but the peace which reigned within&#xD;
t1w~t chamber was a stranger to Maud's he~4; and, as a&#xD;

"Better? "-and passing her hand over her brow, as&#xD;
though not understanding, asked, vacantly, "Who are&#xD;
you?&#xD;
"~istor Agnes."&#xD;
"Where am I?"&#xD;
"In the Convent Qf St. Madeleine."&#xD;
"And where is that?" asked Maud, a~ if~ oblivious of&#xD;
what had occurred.&#xD;
"In New York."&#xD;
"in New York?" she asked, as if not hearing aright,&#xD;
and pressing her hands to her brow, as if to recall her&#xD;
wandering thoughts.&#xD;
"Yes, in New York. Do you not remember-4'&#xD;
J3ut she stopped suddenly, as if afraid to go. on with the&#xD;
sentence.&#xD;
Maud's mind seemed still bewildered, as she asked, iii&#xD;
a half-unconscious way,&#xD;
"how came I here?"&#xD;
"We foun&amp;amp; you tying upon the square in a state of&#xD;
insensibility, a~'d brought you here."&#xD;
"Why did younot let me die ~&#xD;
"Our mission is to save, and to bring all whom we ~an&#xD;
into the fold of Christ."&#xD;
Without noticing these words, Maud sprang up in the&#xD;
bed, and asked, as though it had just. occurred to her:&#xD;
"Was the prisoner killed?" and she scarcely breathed,&#xD;
as she awaited ~n answer.&#xD;
"No ~ but he w~s wounded." /&#xD;

"Who is Sister Madeleine?"&#xD;
"The prioress of this convent."&#xD;
"God rest her soul! She will have her reward. Can&#xD;
£ see her?"&#xD;
"She has just left me, and, as she is so much fatigued,&#xD;
begged not to be disturbed, unless it was something very&#xD;
urgent. You can see her in the mornincr"&#xD;
"But I must be gone with the early dawn.".&#xD;
"Gone where?"&#xD;
"To where duty calls me."&#xD;
"Our first duty is to take care of that life which God&#xD;
has given us, so that we. may thereby fulfil the mission&#xD;
for which each one of us is ordained."&#xD;
"My first and paramount and only duty is to one I&#xD;
love*; and I must hasten, or it will he too late."&#xD;
".De~ar lady, that is an earthly passion, and should be&#xD;
uprooted from your heart, wherein should be implanted&#xD;
alone the love of Christ and the advancement of his&#xD;
kingdom." And as this gentle woman ceased speaking&#xD;
she bent her brimming eyes upon the floor, her bosom&#xD;
heaved with excitement and paiu~hl emotions, as she&#xD;
remembered that a love misplaced and betrayed had sent&#xD;
her to seek consolation within those cloistered walls.&#xD;
Being too~ much occupied with her own thoughts to&#xD;
liced the ~&amp;amp;or4s of this good woman, after a few moments&#xD;
of abstraction, Maud said,&#xD;
"how does Sister Madeleine gain access to the pris~&#xD;
oiier?&#xD;
"We are never refused admittance anywhere. But do&#xD;
Lry and go to sleep now, and you will be better in the&#xD;
&#xD;
morning. I will be in the adjoining room, and if yoi~&#xD;
need anything, just ring."&#xD;
With, these words she kissed Maud's brow, and went&#xD;
softly out.&#xD;
Maud could not sleep, and with the early morning she&#xD;
was stirring, although vcry weak. Soon after, and much&#xD;
against the wishes of Sister Agnes, she left the Convent,&#xD;
and wended her footsteps' in the direction of her thoughts.&#xD;

prospect of dying-of expiating his many offences against&#xD;
God and man-and had prayed that all the fatal love&#xD;
which had been bestowed upon him might be turned into&#xD;
hate. He thought perchance he might be forgotten-or,&#xD;
better, his memory scorned, and he felt infinite gladness&#xD;
in the thought. But now, out of the comforting depths&#xD;
of woe, he was suddenly, mysteriously, and unexpectedly&#xD;
recalled to life, and love, and the world, upon whose&#xD;
mimic boards he had played a tragic part, had walked a&#xD;
shadow, a wretched thing of no substaiice; and all this&#xD;
came back to him with fresh charms, fresh temptations.&#xD;
Insidious as was the syren tongue which lured him back&#xD;
to love, and life, he stubbornly refused to listen to its&#xD;
seductive music; and to his honor be it said, his only&#xD;
thought now was, how he. might restore this deluded&#xD;
woman to home, husband, and friends. To die, he was&#xD;
determined; he was sick at heart of the misery which&#xD;
ever followed in his footsteps, like the pC5tihMiCC which&#xD;
comes with the East wind. If he fid influence Maud&#xD;
to return to her home-to forget aiid hate him-he would&#xD;
feel that he had not lived altogether in vain.&#xD;
in th~{midst of these reveries the guard entered with&#xD;
his coarse repast. it failed to toml)t his famishing tlionrh&#xD;
b&#xD;
fastidious appetite, and lie pushed it from him in dis~ust&#xD;
Soon after, Sister Madeleine made her daily visit. She&#xD;
was informed that her services would be no longer need~&#xD;
ed ~ and besides, as his trial would begin on the follow&#xD;
ii~ day~. he. might not be permitted to receive visitors.&#xD;
"As~ou wish, sir," said this gentle woman * "but if II&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
cannot visit yon, I will never cease to pray for the wel&#xD;
fare of your soul."&#xD;
"Your kindness is beyond what I deserve," said D'Es~&#xD;
taing, remorsefully,~ "and, could I bend my unworthy&#xD;
knee in prayer, it would be to ask the heavenly Father to&#xD;
reward you for all your goodness to a lonely, wretched,&#xD;
but not ungrateful luau;" and, pressing her hand to his&#xD;
lips, lie did utter an acceptable ejaculation to God as she&#xD;
glided from his presence.&#xD;
The day wore away slowly, wearily, to two hearts.&#xD;
While the one thought only of the coming meeting, the&#xD;
other thought of how this woman, who had~ suffered so&#xD;
much, had perilled so much, might be restored, unscathed&#xD;
by seaiidal, to her abandoned home.&#xD;
Then new difficulties arose as doubt was added to hope.&#xD;
lie feared that what lie would accomplish was simply an&#xD;
impossibility. how could a woman who had voluntarily&#xD;
forsaken her home ever be induced to return to~ it?&#xD;
There was so mnni~h to be forgiven, so many concessions&#xD;
to be made, so much to be endured; and even if. the hus~&#xD;
band and wife shon be reconciled under such circum~&#xD;
stances, would not t ghost of other days ever be rising&#xD;
up between them, as a barrier to all harmony of thought,&#xD;
feeling, and action in the future ~&#xD;
Alas! how easily things go wrong! Alas! how diffl~&#xD;
cult is it to right them I The expiation of a life, the&#xD;
bemided knee of penance, the sacrifice of all the heart's-&#xD;
most t'&amp;amp;miderly cherished idols, sometimes fail to undo the&#xD;
sin of a single l~our, a ~inrle mon&#xD;
Fully an hoar before the specified time, Maud was&#xD;
eqi ipped for l.ier walk. Thiou6'hi pale, worn, and hag-&#xD;
gard, she was still beautiful; and the dress of a ~e'&#xD;

&#xD;
AN UNEXPECTED LETTEII.&#xD;
&#xD;
1i~ieuse served but to enhance her refined, spiritual love&#xD;
lines.&#xD;
It was well for her that the dense population of the&#xD;
city were altogether too self-occupied to take notice - of&#xD;
her movements, or she might have been arrested in her&#xD;
mad undertaking. At her boarding-house she had made&#xD;
herself known as Mrs. hall, and her quiet, unobtrusive&#xD;
manners would have silenced all suspicion, even granting&#xD;
any had existed.&#xD;
Walking rapidly, she was soon at the entrance of the&#xD;
prison. The warden at first refused, and finally, with&#xD;
great reluctance, admitted her, only satisfying his con-&#xD;
science by attending her, himself until another was met,&#xD;
who conducted her to the cell of the prisoner.&#xD;
When the door creaked on its heavy hinges, Maud was&#xD;
fearful of a scene which might be tray her, and thwart&#xD;
the cherished purpose concealed within the hidden depths&#xD;
of a woman's ingenuity. And it was with the utmost&#xD;
difficulty that she controlled herself, as D'Estaing, spring-&#xD;
ing forward, seized both of her hands in his, and in an&#xD;
exci&amp;amp;d and tremulous tone, whispe~' d,&#xD;
"Angel of mercy! what am I, that you should so peril&#xD;
all you hold good for me?"&#xD;
She laughed, as at the ratings of an insane man. "A&#xD;
fellow-creature in distress. See, I have brought a Bible&#xD;
to comfort you."&#xD;
"May God in heaven," he cried, profiting by hei hint,&#xD;
"bless all those who make this cell radiant with their&#xD;
presence!"&#xD;
"Do not think of* that just now. Kneel with me, and&#xD;
let us offer up a silent prayer,. that strength may be given&#xD;
you sufficient to your present need."&#xD;
&#xD;
AN UNEXPECTED LETTER.           285&#xD;
Kneeling side by. side in that dark, sombre cell, ~&#xD;
kind of painful rapture thrilled those two misguided and&#xD;
guilty beings, as they prayed indeed to the great Alk.&#xD;
Father.&#xD;
The prayer was strengthening, sustaining. it was with&#xD;
reluctance that they arose from their knees. The mois~&#xD;
ture that covered the jailor's eyes like a film of fine glass,&#xD;
showed that a spark of tenderness, even in his heart, had&#xD;
survived the callousness that grows out of familiarity&#xD;
with criminals. His feelings were wrought up to un-&#xD;
comfortable tension. lie was glad when'* the prayer&#xD;
ended.&#xD;
Saying a hasty "good-by," Maud flew along ~he streets,&#xD;
until she again reached the train of cars upon which she&#xD;
had conie down, and in a little while, in her own room,&#xD;
was reading the following note, which had been slipped&#xD;
into her hand as she was rising from her prayer in the&#xD;
prison-cell :&#xD;
"My God! Max~d, why have you followed me here?&#xD;
But to make misery more miserable ?-to tempt me back&#xD;
to the life I shall resign most willingly? l~eturn, I&#xD;
implore you, to your husband, friends, and home! Go&#xD;
back, I entreat you, before it is too late! Know that I&#xD;
do not wish to live. I have determined to die. If not&#xD;
by the hand of the law, in some other way I shall end&#xD;
this wretched life. It has been nothing but a curse to&#xD;
me-a curse to others. Not even can you tempt me to&#xD;
live; and I scorn to be rescued by any power save that&#xD;
of natural death. Forgive me, if you can, for the past;&#xD;
and, if it be any consolation to you, know that I worship&#xD;
yoti,. miserable wretch tho~ighi I am. Do not attempt to&#xD;

&#xD;
see me any more. It may endanger your life, and assur~&#xD;
edly will your reputation, and can do me no good. Fare.&#xD;
well, forever!"&#xD;
She pondered. Was it for this, then, she had left her&#xD;
home, sacrificed her fair fame, risked, the loss of her&#xD;
immortal soul? Bitterer than the waters of Marah were&#xD;
the tears which flowed from her eyes upon reading this&#xD;
note~ ~he then fully experienced what it was to bo for-&#xD;
saken by both God and man.&#xD;
"Alone!" she cried; "alone! alone! ~&#xD;
Truly she was alone, in the great, heartless, heaving,&#xD;
tumultuous, bustling, busy world. Yet not all alone; her&#xD;
sorrows bore her willing companionship-ate, and slept,&#xD;
and walked, and talked with her, and gibed and mocked&#xD;
and laughed in contempt.&#xD;
CIIAPTEI~ XII.&#xD;
~ GUILTY~ OR NOT GUILTY.~'&#xD;
ILE trial had been resumed, and was being prose-&#xD;
cuted with all the energy of which ~ well-paid&#xD;
court is capable, and all the vigor, all the rigor,&#xD;
which hatred or revenge could inspire.&#xD;
The late fatality had somewhat chastened and subdued&#xD;
the ardor of the public, and the temporary court-room&#xD;
was not so much crowded as the judicial chamber had&#xD;
been ~upon the opening day of the trial However, there&#xD;
&#xD;
were many more or less interested present, and they were&#xD;
a motley gang of men and women, representing all class&#xD;
es, ages, and conditions.&#xD;
To a close observer, there was no difficulty in distin.&#xD;
guishing between the friends and the enemies of the&#xD;
prisoner. Perhaps, for "friends," the term "sympa-&#xD;
thizers" would be better; for the unfortunate man was&#xD;
an entire stranger in the city, and could claim but a&#xD;
single friend, who had dared everything, braved every-&#xD;
thing, deserted everything, to attest the strength of that&#xD;
friendship.&#xD;
human nature often presents strange contradictions, as&#xD;
well as odd intermingling of good and bad; and there&#xD;
is no greater evidence of the truth of this assertion, than&#xD;
is to be found in the sympathy that one supposed to be a&#xD;
martyr excites.&#xD;
Without claiming for D'Estaing the character and&#xD;
position of a martyr, he was a lonely man, without&#xD;
friends or influence, "a stranger in a strange place," and&#xD;
persecuted by a horde of man-shaped vampires with a&#xD;
malici6usness which would have distinguished a set of&#xD;
barbarians. Seeing and knowing this, as the publi~ did,&#xD;
i~i fact, the hearts 'of many strangers were moved to. coin-&#xD;
passion for the crrino ina~~, while at the same time they&#xD;
deeply condemned the dcccl with which he was charged.&#xD;
Generally, men endeavor 'to hide their best feelings&#xD;
from the world; so these sentiments in behalf of D'Eg-&#xD;
taing were only acknowledged in their own souls, and&#xD;
brought no relief to the prisoner in his hour of need, for&#xD;
whatever would be effective imist be active.&#xD;
Included among the spectators in the court-room that&#xD;
day were some of the associates 'of Gustave ])~zv'~"~&#xD;

~'GUILTY, OR NOT GUILTY.~&#xD;
&#xD;
some of the band of godless profligates of which h4~ had&#xD;
been chief; and as Maud ~ag~rly scanned the faces of all&#xD;
who entered, she visibly started, and pressed her hand&#xD;
upon her forehead, when IDe Vere came in, with a&#xD;
gaudily-dressed woman leaning on his arm.&#xD;
Tie was very pale. His, arm was in a sling, and it was&#xD;
evident that he too had suffered from the late calamity.&#xD;
There were traces of great beauty still visible in the&#xD;
woman's face, although' dissipation had impressed its'&#xD;
* stamp upon it, and a restlessness of the eyes and a nerv-&#xD;
ous manner betokened a conscience ill 'at ease.&#xD;
With a rapidity and correctness which is only known&#xD;
* to women through their ready intuition, Maud' felt confi-&#xD;
dent, without being informed, that this woman was Ehise&#xD;
Daponte. She was instantly surrounded by a ni~mber of&#xD;
flashily-dressed and dissipated-looking men, ~and soon was&#xD;
engaged in apparently as gay and amusing a conversation&#xD;
as if in a ball-room, instead of a hall of justice, where&#xD;
the life as well as the reputation of a man had been&#xD;
thrown in the scales.&#xD;
Maud was a silent witness of this harrowing scene,&#xD;
from behind the heavy crape veil drawn over her face;&#xD;
and although the trial was proceeding with much more&#xD;
than the usual interest and excitement, she saw nothing,&#xD;
aud heard nothing but the sneers and innuendoes, the.&#xD;
careless jest and heartless repartee, from the wicked per-&#xD;
secutors of the man she would save. At length, when&#xD;
her feelings could no longer endure this terrible torture,&#xD;
~he made a quiet exit from the court-room, and, gain-&#xD;
ing the streets, wandered about in an aimless and pur-&#xD;
poseless manner, until entire physical exhaustion drove&#xD;
he~ to seek her own room.&#xD;
&#xD;
The shop-windows with all their tempting brilliance,&#xD;
the dry-goods palaces with all their gorgeous appoint.&#xD;
meuts, the gayly-dress~d promenaders, the costly equi-&#xD;
~agcs with their burden of beautiful and fashionable&#xD;
women, had no attraction for her gaze. In all the wide&#xD;
world there was but one face, one figure, that then had&#xD;
part in her thoughts. And this face and this figure&#xD;
belonged to the prisoner on trial for his life. One idea&#xD;
alone absorbed her, and that was, how the life of this&#xD;
prisoner, might be clutched from the hands of the execu-&#xD;
tioner.~~~show his body, to her the impersonation of all that&#xD;
was perfect ift physical manhood-might be rescued from&#xD;
the allowsw' in a word how she mi~ht contrive to save&#xD;
D'Estaing.&#xD;
Waking or sleeping, it was ever with lici'; and some-&#xD;
times, in the still hours of the iiight, she would spring&#xD;
from her couch in horror, as her morbid imagination con-&#xD;
j ured up in dreams the frightful gibbet with its dangling&#xD;
victim. In such visions she saw his pale face, his blood-&#xD;
shot eyes, his quiverin, lips; and, the awaking to know&#xD;
they were but dreams, was but the awaking to know that&#xD;
the l)ictlll'es seemed destined to be real. And in the soil-&#xD;
tiude of her little chamber she made the nights pitiful&#xD;
with her wails, her sobs, her sighs; and in the midst of&#xD;
this agony she would cry:&#xD;
how long, 0 iLord, how long!&#xD;
At the ~ppoimitcd hour she visited the "Tombs," but&#xD;
was altogether unprepared for the new trial which await-&#xD;

~was on his countenance, when he extended his hand and&#xD;
bade her "good evening."&#xD;
"I am very sorry, Sister Madeleine," said he, "to refuse&#xD;
you admittance to the prisoner, but I have received posi.&#xD;
tive instructions to let no one see him wader any circurn-&#xD;
stances."&#xD;
She was overcome at this unexpected stroke of misfor-&#xD;
tune, and, sinking into a chair, groaned in agony of&#xD;
spirit. She was, indeed, naturally a timid woman, and,&#xD;
never having been called upon to act for herself, was not&#xD;
more courageous than inexperienced. But when the&#xD;
object of a woman's love is threatened, brain and heart&#xD;
quickly act in concert, and instantly suggest some plan of&#xD;
relief.&#xD;
Throwing back her veil, she looked up into the ward-&#xD;
en's face. '~ I am no Sister of Charity," said she. "Look&#xD;
at me-I am a 8?~?ering woman. here is gold for you.&#xD;
If you will permit me to see the prisoner instantly and&#xD;
alone, this sum shall be doubled, trebled-yes, even quad-&#xD;
rupled." And when she ceased speaking, she trembled&#xD;
* from, anxiety and suspense.&#xD;
* Seizing *the dainty, golden-fringed, ~ill~en purse, the&#xD;
eyes of the jailor sparkled as he opened jt, and counted&#xD;
fifty bright gold eagles.&#xD;
"V/eli, now, that's ~ot very bad 1" he said. "This&#xD;
much money isn't easily made every day. But-let me&#xD;
see! Let-.--me-5CC!" lie stroked his shaggy beard,&#xD;
and frowned, and looked down to the stone floor, as if&#xD;
there might be something on its smoothly-worn, flinty&#xD;
face, to enlighten him between avarice and duty.&#xD;
"Do ~not keep me long in suspense, L pray you 1" cried&#xD;
Maud, imjatiently.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Come, now; don't get in too big a flurry!" said the&#xD;
sailor, with an air of authority, and as if he would like&#xD;
to have said, "You are in my power." "It's no light&#xD;
matter, this way of being swung up just to ~gratify some&#xD;
fine lady's whim. I've got to get rid o~ the guard in&#xD;
some way, for they know of this order; but how to do it,&#xD;
is not such an easy thing."&#xD;
"how many are there? " asked Maud.&#xD;
"Only one-the one that walks in front of his celL"&#xD;
"Oh, that is easily done!" said IMaud. "Send him&#xD;
off on an errand."&#xD;
"Well, I declare!" ex~daimed the jailor, a grim smile&#xD;
lighting up his coarse, hard features. " It took a woman&#xD;
to find out the forbidden fruit, and the truth is, they huve&#xD;
been in so much devilment ever since, that they under-&#xD;
stand getting out of Scrapes as ~vell as most other people&#xD;
do getting into thefi~. I'll do as you suggest; so, just sit'&#xD;
down and make yourself easy until I clear the ~eoast, and&#xD;
I'll be back."&#xD;
Locking the door, he hurried himself away, and,&#xD;
although the time seemed well-nigh an age to Maud, his&#xD;
work was quickly done. IReturning for her, she followed&#xD;
him, with a quickly-beating heart, through the dark, cold,&#xD;
narrow galleries, and, unlocking, he pushed her rather&#xD;
rudely into the prisoner's cell.&#xD;
"When I rap three times, come out instantly," said he,~&#xD;
hurriedly.&#xD;
Once within the cell, she had to stand a minute or two&#xD;
before she could proceed; but, thanks to the kindness of&#xD;
a struggling moonbeam which just then stole through the&#xD;
grating, she discovered the object of her search lying on&#xD;
his coarse couch.&#xD;

&#xD;
By his deep aftd steady breathing she fancied he must&#xD;
be sleeping; and, advancing noiselessly and bending ovem&#xD;
him, she found that her surmise was correct. Kneeling&#xD;
beside him, she offered up to Heaven a prayer of thank-&#xD;
fulness; and raising his hand, which was thrown out over&#xD;
the edge of the conch, pressed it to her lips.&#xD;
lIe was instantly awakened; and as the moonlight fell&#xD;
4full upon her face, a cry of delight burst from him, and&#xD;
springing up, he clasped her convulsively to his bosom.&#xD;
"Maud! Maud! how came you here? Or is tl~is only&#xD;
a phantom come to mock me? Is it a dream?"&#xD;
holding her off at arm's length, he scrutinized her&#xD;
'closely.&#xD;
"It is not a dream," she whispered. "It is I-it is&#xD;
Maud!"&#xD;
"But why do you linger here?" he exclaimed. "bid&#xD;
I not implore you, in my letter, to return to those whom&#xD;
you have deserted for me? Go! go, I beseech you,&#xD;
before it is too late, for it can bring you only misery and&#xD;
death to cling to me."&#xD;
"Misery and death, with you, Alphonse, are preferable&#xD;
to happiness and life without you," ~he said, with assumed&#xD;
calmness.&#xD;
"I wish you did not love me!" said he, as he pushed&#xD;
back her hood and kissed her cold, sorrow-seamed bi'ow.&#xD;
"Why do you wish this? "&#xD;
"Because it makes it so hard to die," he replied, with&#xD;
a shuddering groan.&#xD;
"l3ut you shall not die! You must live!" were the&#xD;
agonized exclamations that burst from her heart.&#xD;
"how can that be?" he asked, quickly.&#xD;

"Lscape to what?" he cried, eagerly.&#xD;
" To life."&#xD;
"V~Til1 you fly with me? Will you live with me2&#xD;
Yf ill you be mine?" he asked, excitedly, holding her&#xD;
face up to the moonlight, as if to read his answer in its&#xD;
tell-tale looks. "If so, we will fly to-night-now I My&#xD;
wealth by this time must have increased largely. We&#xD;
will find my former guardian somewhere, and the 'wide,&#xD;
wide world' sh~ll be our home. Only say the word, and&#xD;
we will seek some little spot of earth, some lone island,&#xD;
where we shall be all in all to each other, and where our&#xD;
only ambition shall be to outvie each other in loving.&#xD;
Say the word, my love, my life, and we will go!"&#xD;
11cr head had sunk upon his breast; tears were pour-&#xD;
ing down her cheeks, and God-the God of mercy and&#xD;
all goodness-oiily knows how fiercely she wrestled with&#xD;
her heart to resist the temptation of tlia~ hour. 11cr low&#xD;
sobs were her only response, as, raising her head, he&#xD;
looked steadily in her face, and said,&#xD;
"You are silent-you weep. have you no answer for&#xD;
me?" Still not a word escaped her lips. "Will you be&#xD;
mine? Will you go, or not? Answer me, Maud! Now,&#xD;
or never!"&#xD;
The agony of her tortured heart found expression in&#xD;
the pale and distorted features of her face. She looked&#xD;
up, and, in a broken voice, replied,&#xD;
" I cannot ! "&#xD;
The next instant he threw her from him. Sh~~ laid~&#xD;
prostrate and weeping on the dungeon-~~r, while he&#xD;
fiercely strode from one end to the other of his narrow&#xD;
cell. At length he bent over, and gently said,&#xD;

&#xD;
"You have never loved me. My death be upon youm&#xD;
head!"&#xD;
A fresh groan burst from her, and in tears she implored&#xD;
him,&#xD;
"Recall those cruel words!"&#xD;
"As God lives, they are true. Here I was alone,&#xD;
deserted, and content-yes, eager-to die. You came,&#xD;
with all your soft blandishments, and wooed me back to&#xD;
life and love. What are life and love, without you?&#xD;
And when I ask you to be to fly with me-what&#xD;
is your answer? 'I cannot!' Go, poor deluded womaii,&#xD;
and leave me as you found me!"&#xD;
"Oh, Alphonse*!" she cried, in agony, "God knows&#xD;
that my love is as fathomless as the ocean, and as limit-&#xD;
less as space itself; but Ii cannot commit the crime to&#xD;
which you urge me."&#xD;
"In the eyes of the world you are already gu~ty," he&#xD;
said, with stinging reproach.&#xD;
"But in the eyes of God I am not guilty." And as&#xD;
she cast her eves heavenward, moved by an irresistible&#xD;
impulse, D'Estaing knelt by her side, and, in the unut-&#xD;
tered prayer that went up to the throne of the Eternal,&#xD;
they knew that they loved more madly, more hopelessly,&#xD;
more recklessly, t~han ever before.&#xD;
Three raps upon the iron door of the cell startled them..&#xD;
"Who is it?" said D'Estaing.&#xD;
"It is the signal tha1t I must leave you; but do not let&#xD;
us part in anger."&#xD;
"No, dearest," he said; "we will not." Then folding&#xD;
her closely to his heart, "Forgive me, my earthly angel&#xD;
all my angry words, all my ipapatience."&#xD;
"Freely and fully.~~&#xD;
&#xD;
The raps were repeated.&#xD;
"When will you come again?"&#xD;
"As soon as possible." And with these words sh~&#xD;
slipped out of the open door, out into the dimly-lighted&#xD;
corridor out into the wretchedness of her Ioneliness-het&#xD;
absolute loneliness-out into streets with her sick and&#xD;
weary heart-with her l)enumbed conscience, her weak&#xD;
despised self; hungry for light, hungry for the sympathy&#xD;
for which her soul would have endured eternal loss before&#xD;
it would have asked it from the world, that jostled her at&#xD;
cvery turn, and Jreathed even in her ear.&#xD;
As she hurried with the jailor along the' dark passage&#xD;
that leads from the open court of expiation, he told her&#xD;
he must say something more to her, and led her into a&#xD;
small private room.&#xD;
"It will be im~ossib1e," he said, "for me to do this&#xD;
sort of thing every night. I am afraid I shall ~be dis~&#xD;
covered. But if you will agree to pay me well, I can&#xD;
manage so that you shall get to see him once or twice a&#xD;

"You are very kind and considerate," said Maud. "I&#xD;
shall pay you well, rest assured."&#xD;
"%u must come, then," said he, in an undertone,&#xD;
"about eight, or half-past eight o'clock."&#xD;
"Very well, then. I shall be here without fail on&#xD;

to her temporary home. Upon reaching her chamber~&#xD;
she threw herself upon her bed, but not to sleep. From&#xD;
side to side she tossed, her heavy sighs alone relieving the&#xD;
surchargings of her misQry; and when the morning sun&#xD;
light crept in through the bars of her window-shutters, it&#xD;
saw her still in her serge dress; while her pale face and&#xD;
tear-stained eyes told the tale of despair which dwelt in&#xD;
her breast.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
UNDER THE GAS-LIGHT.&#xD;
HE 8aldns of Monsieur Duponte had never been&#xD;
more brilliant and attractive than on the night&#xD;
referred to. The playing had been reckless&#xD;
beyond conception, and several, who had entered those&#xD;
doors with princely fortunes, had departed penniless and&#xD;
Wretched.&#xD;
The coalition of Duponte and De Yore had been suc~&#xD;
eessfui, far exceeding their most sanguine expectations;&#xD;
but Elise was reserved ai~d melancholy. Do Yore in&#xD;
vain attempted to divine the cause. The godless life she&#xD;
had led was groxvin~ sickening. Vice and remorse were&#xD;
ploughing deep furrows across her once smooth brow, and&#xD;
a close observer might have told, by her startled and&#xD;
nervous manner, that the same cankering and corroding&#xD;
causes were eating into her vitals, and saPping even the&#xD;
life from the heart.&#xD;
"Why so pensive and silent, mcs ch~e ? "~ said Dc&#xD;
&#xD;
Were, as they lingered alone, and he pressed her to hi~&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
"I am weary and heart-sick," she answered, as the.&#xD;
giving ghost of misspent days and a wasted life rose up&#xD;
before her.&#xD;
"Weary df what, my love?" asked he, tenderly.&#xD;
"Weary of the life Ii am leading-.-of the life II have&#xD;
led; weary of life itself, disgusted with my acts, and&#xD;
heart-sick at their consequences." And tears, which had&#xD;
been long-oh, how long V-a stranger to the eyes of this&#xD;
reckless and relentless woman, forced their crystal drops&#xD;
through her slender jewelled fingers aiW fell upon the&#xD;
diamond brooch that confined a colla~ of rarely rich&#xD;
pQint d'A1en~on~ around her proudly arching threat, to&#xD;
the bodice of her velvet robe.&#xD;
"Why, Elise, you astonish, me!" exclaimesl De Vere.&#xD;
"What! tears in the eyes of the rich, handsome~ hAl.&#xD;
liant, envied Elise Duponte?" And, drawing still more&#xD;
closely to her, he applied a delicate cambric mouckoir&#xD;
her eyes, with gentle words and multiplied caresses.&#xD;
She withdrew the handkerchief with a gesture of iiu~&#xD;
patience, as if the perfume which scented its folds nause-&#xD;
ated her.&#xD;
"Let them flow!" she cried. "They relieve the&#xD;
oppression here "-laying her hand upon her heart.&#xD;
"You are only a little nervous to-night, m~s petite~&#xD;
You are wearied by all this heavy' work. Go to year&#xD;
room, dearest. I am sure a good night's rest will quite&#xD;
restore you"&#xD;
"Yes; but how can I rest? Sleep is unknown to me,&#xD;

languishing in that dungeon. I am pursued by spectres,&#xD;
who grin upon me, and whisper, 'Murder! Revenge!&#xD;
And this fascinating~.demoness, who now began indeed&#xD;
to feel the whip of conscience in its most torturing lashes,&#xD;
buried her fac6 in her hands to shut out the haunting&#xD;
sights conjured up from her evil deeds.&#xD;
~' Oh, Elise, this is all stuff-sheer nonsense!" cried&#xD;
iDe Mere, in a petulant tone, though he looked perplexed&#xD;
somewhat, as he added: "I cannot permit you to behave&#xD;
in this excited manner. You make yourself ill. These&#xD;
fears are childish, and unworthy a woman of your indoin&#xD;
table spirit."&#xD;
"Be they childish, womanly, or what you may please&#xD;
to esteem them, they must also come to you some day;&#xD;
for I, Elise Duponte, do tell you this night, that the con-&#xD;
science implanted in us by God, through which we may&#xD;
be enabled to distinguish between right and wrong, it&#xD;
matters not by what means w~ may crush and subdue its&#xD;
chiding for a while, will make itself heard at last, and&#xD;
then " The sentence was concluded only by a fresh&#xD;
burst of tears.&#xD;
"Elise! Elise, you know not how you distress me!"&#xD;
cried iDe Mere.&#xD;
"And I shall distress you still' more!" she exclaimed,&#xD;
vehemently. "I tell you, you must and dw&amp;amp;1l rescue&#xD;
Delamero from the gallows!"&#xD;
"Impossible I" cried De. Mere, in utter amazement.&#xD;
"Nothino in this life is impossible!" she cried, imupi-&#xD;
ousl~, "where gold is plentiful; and I swear to you,&#xD;
sooner will I die, and by my own hand, than have that&#xD;
man's blood added to the load of guilt on my soul."&#xD;

"Ask anything in reason, Elise, and I wilVgrant your&#xD;
request," he said, calmly; "but I cannot grant impossi.&#xD;

"Impossibilities! Empty your coffers; drain them to&#xD;
the last dollar; buy up counsel; bribe the jury and the&#xD;
prosedution-~Q~2l men have r rice and you have&#xD;
money enough to do all this. If this appear impossible,&#xD;
buy the wardens of the prison, if it should take the last&#xD;
dollar of qui' ill-gotten wealth, and set D'Estaing free.&#xD;
Then I promise to be your slave----~your abject slave, if&#xD;
you wish, for life-aud help you to make thousands more.&#xD;
We can soon refill our empty chests-can we not, dear&#xD;
Alfr~de?" she said, with tender blandishment-a look of&#xD;
mock humility softening her eyes as she gazed into the&#xD;
depths of his own for a reply.&#xD;
He answered, slowly, "It is now utterly beyond my&#xD;
power to avert the course of the law. By your commands&#xD;
the counsel and jury have already been purchased and per-&#xD;
jured. What would they think of me, were I to ask them&#xD;
to change now? One day y~u demand the man's life;&#xD;
the next you ask that he shall~ be set at liberty. ~It is too&#xD;
late now. You must abide th~ consequences."&#xD;
"Were their fees doubled, or trebled, they would ask&#xD;
no questions," she said, dog~dly. "And I tell you,&#xD;
AIfr6de De Mere, that I, and I alone, should pay the&#xD;
penalty of the death of Gustave iDelamere. Yes, I was&#xD;
his murderess; and I would to God the same dagger&#xD;
which pierced his heart had ended also ~my wretc1~ed&#xD;
existence."&#xD;
As a fierce pang of jealousy shot through the heart&#xD;
Do Mere, he arose to his feet, and said, in the moat&#xD;
intense state of excitement,&#xD;

"It is ever the same therne-Delamere! Delamere!&#xD;
And, with a sneer and an oath, "It is clear no one else&#xD;

"Will you~ do what I ask?" said Elise, her features&#xD;
pale and rigid with an unrevealed resolve.&#xD;
"Never !~ by heaven!" he cried, and strode the floor&#xD;
like a madman, muttering fierce and foul imprecations.&#xD;
"You will not?" said Elise.&#xD;
Never ! "&#xD;
"Then hear me, Alfr6de de Vere: my blood shall be&#xD;
required at your h~nds. You defy me? Then the result&#xD;
be on your soul."l And, with the forced caimPess of a&#xD;
mighty will, she gathered up the heavy folds of her vel-&#xD;
vet dress, drew more tightly around her the lace scarf,&#xD;
and walked from the room with the proud step of an&#xD;
empress.&#xD;
lIe was left alone-alone with his evil deeds; but they&#xD;
were company enough for him at that moment.&#xD;
ChAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
REMORSE.&#xD;
FEW days after this interview, the city papers&#xD;
were teeming with accounts of a thrilling inci-&#xD;
dent. From one of them the following is ex-&#xD;
tracted:&#xD;
"In the 'Tombs,' the cell of the pP~o~ier Alphonse&#xD;
&#xD;
I)elainere-D'Estaing w~.s the scene of a revolting tragedy&#xD;
last night, which resulted in the instant death of Elise&#xD;
Duponte by suicide.&#xD;
"Overcome with remorse at the part she had taken in~.&#xD;
the capture and persecution of the prisoner, and urged&#xD;
on l)y the death of Gustave and Marie Delamere, she.&#xD;
went to offer the prisoner his liberty. This he indig4&#xD;
neatly refused at her hands, and upbraided her in the&#xD;
bitterest terms xvith the death of those two whom he&#xD;
declared she had murdered. She cried for mercy, and,&#xD;
casting herself at his feet, implored him, with tears in&#xD;
her eyes, to fly, and rescue her soul from the guilt of his&#xD;
blood. As if her touch had been infectious, he cast her&#xD;
contemptuously from him, telling her he would prefer&#xD;
ten thousand deaths, to life given by such blood-stained&#xD;
hands. Again she pleaded, and again and again ;bnthe&#xD;
persistently cried, 'Never!' While she continued ear~&#xD;
nestly to implore him to escape.&#xD;
"At length, finding all remonstrance vain, she drew&#xD;
forth a Spanish stiletto which was concealed in her belt~,&#xD;
and, by a well-directed blow, sent its point into her heart.&#xD;
With a groan, and a piteous look from her startled eyes,&#xD;
she fell upon the floor of the cell, crying, 'Farewell!&#xD;
farewell!'&#xD;
"D'Lstaing flew to the door, and, beating furiously&#xD;
upon it, cried, 'Murder! murder! murder !' Pull soon&#xD;
the prison was aroused. A surgeon came, but he pxo.&#xD;
flounced all life extinct; for the weapon had been sent&#xD;
straight to the l)rineipal vital organ.&#xD;
"The jailor and his assistants have all been arrested,&#xD;
but there is a generally-expressed desire that the former&#xD;
shall be released. his services have ever been faithfully&#xD;

whiAi has so much the semblance of genuilene~s as tQ&#xD;
deceive those best skilled in the detection of false chiro~&#xD;
raphy, bearing this orcllkr:&#xD;
"'Allow Sister Fid6le access to the cell of the prisoner&#xD;
JYEstaiug.'&#xD;
"The fearful g~ncde of this misguided woman should&#xD;
be a warning to all those who prefer the gilded paths of&#xD;
vice to the unvarnished walks of virtue. For, sooner or&#xD;
later, though the time be delayed until the honest death-&#xD;
hour, remorse will overtake them, and crush them with&#xD;
the weight of its bitter accusations. The public heart&#xD;
goes forth in deepest sympathy for this wretched, and, it&#xD;
may be added, irresponsible woman; for, born beneath&#xD;
the sickly' glare of midnight carousals, reared in their&#xD;
demoralizing atmosphere, she was very early trained by&#xD;
both mother and father to the career of guilt in which&#xD;
she was such a brilliant and successful leader. If the&#xD;
daughter's soul wa~ so lashed into self -avenging fury,&#xD;
what torture must they suffer, who in the sight of Jleaven&#xD;
are responsible for the manner in which the child was&#xD;
reared. Vengeance unto them, while all must, or should,&#xD;
pray for pardon and peace to the ashes of Elise Du.&#xD;
poute."'&#xD;
The paper dropped from Maud's hands, With strained&#xD;
and flashing eyes she had commenced, and, dissolved in&#xD;
tears, she had finished the touching story.&#xD;
In this a new dilemma was presented her. The jaiior,&#xD;
her only friend, under arrest, what could she do?&#xD;
- Thought was agonizing. Wonder ceased to be wonder,&#xD;
and took the form of speculation. Should she ever sets&#xD;
&#xD;
D'Estaing again? and, if so, how and when? She. felt&#xD;
in her feebleness, like a prisoner bird fretting against the&#xD;
bai's of its cage.&#xD;
Throwing on ~her hat, she walked rapidly in the diree&#xD;
tion of the "Tombs," to find her worst fears confirmed..&#xD;
J)onblc guards, composed of strange, ro~igh men, were on&#xD;
duty. The bolted and barred iron grates looked more&#xD;
massive and formidable than ever. Then came another&#xD;
miserable reflection. her money was well-nigh exhaust-&#xD;
ed; and as she almost ran along the crowded streets, men&#xD;
turned to look after her. She was filled with despair,&#xD;
and maddened even to the desire to follow to the grave&#xD;
~Elise Dupoute.&#xD;
"But am I ready to die?" was her mental exclama-&#xD;
lion. "Ready? Ah, no!" She laughed the laugh of&#xD;
a maniac behind her thick veil. "Ready?* No, no; not&#xD;
until he is safe; and then-----"&#xD;
And what then?&#xD;
She sped along, down this street and that, around cor~&#xD;
ner after corner, to return again and again to the prison-&#xD;
gates, muttering incoherently, "Not until he is safe; alid&#xD;
then---"&#xD;
And what then? Poor Thud! thou hast sown the&#xD;
wind; it is meet thou shouidst reap the whirlwind.&#xD;

CIIAPTER XLIV.&#xD;
TOO LATE.&#xD;
ilE jury had brought in a verdict of "guilty" ~&#xD;
the sentence had been solemnly pronounced&#xD;
amidst a death-like silence, and the prisoner had&#xD;
been remanded to solitary confinement.&#xD;
The guards had been doubled, and peremptory orders&#xD;
given the jailor to admit no one, under penalty of removal&#xD;
'and imprisonment. The interest which had been mam~&#xD;
feasted for the unfortunate man ceased with his disappear-&#xD;
ance from public, and in his solitary cdl he felt what it&#xD;
was to be forsaken by friends and forgotten by the woi4d.&#xD;
If this oblivion could have included every human being&#xD;
whom he knew, it would have been welcomed gladly;&#xD;
but when he thought of her who had abandoned every-&#xD;
thing, even reputation and the salvation of her own soul&#xD;
for him, ho became maddened, and life was torture.&#xD;
Deprived of hmnan sympathy, and a stranger to the ~'~-&#xD;
CiOUS pl'011115C5 contained in the holy Book, his conscience&#xD;
racked. him with unceasing accusations, even as the vul-&#xD;
ture l)Icyc(l I1l)Ofl the vitals of Prometheus± his waking&#xD;
hours were written all over with Remorse, and his sleep&#xD;
was harrowed with frightful visions of that final hour&#xD;
which should expose him to mankind as an example of&#xD;
ist ice and a warl1in~ to evil-doers.&#xD;
But what an ignominious death! To be hung like a&#xD;
cOlunlOU felon! his refinement of feeling recoiled from&#xD;
such a death, and if it (x)uld be averted, it should be.&#xD;
But how? It would have. been better t6 have shunned&#xD;
&#xD;
the act which brought such ignominy as its reward, would&#xD;
it not? But men do not think of the consequences, when&#xD;
ruled by passion; and it was too late now to wish the&#xD;
dCC(l undone.&#xD;
Thus day after day of reproaches and heart-burnings&#xD;
passed away, and brought him nearer Eternity; but the&#xD;
hereafter gave him little concern, for his thoughts were&#xD;
equally divided between Maud, and how he could escape&#xD;
the awful death to which he had been sentenced. Prison~&#xD;
bolts and bars have never yet been able to crush a kindly&#xD;
feeling in the human heart, and oftentimes the custodians&#xD;
of unfortunate men have been induced to do them a&#xD;
secret service. Could he hope for such a thing?&#xD;
But what had become of Maud? Perhaps she\v~s ill&#xD;
-dying; and as D'Estaing recalled her pale and haggard&#xD;
face, he groaned in spirit, as memory forced upon him&#xD;
the painful recollection of the blight that fell upon all&#xD;
who came within his fated circle. Poor, erring woman!&#xD;
she was dying, but she gave it little thought, what though&#xD;
her strength was failing rapidly, and her life-blood was&#xD;
ebbing sadly.&#xD;
how the time came and went, she never knew, for the&#xD;
days were sunless, the nights were starless, and no spark&#xD;
of hope irradiated the gloom in whii~h she was enveloped&#xD;
like a funeral pall.&#xD;
Most of her time was spent in gazing at the prison-&#xD;
w~dls, which loomed up dismally before her like some&#xD;
terrible storm-cloud, which bears destruction and d&amp;amp;atE to&#xD;
those who come within its ~blackened track. Once or&#xD;
twice, when passing the prison, she had spoken to the&#xD;
guard, but, without i~eplying, they had only stared at her&#xD;
~nd turned away. Then, walking on, she would soon be&#xD;
&#xD;
R05&#xD;

&#xD;
Too an.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC8258-00000153"/>&#xD;
lost in the crowds which are always surging upon th~&#xD;
streets of the metropolis, until failing stre'igth would&#xD;
warn her to retrace her weary footsteps. When within&#xD;
h~r room, she would throw herself upon a couch, but to&#xD;
eat he the pillow afresh with scalding tears, or perhaps&#xD;
watch from the window those cruel Walls which impris&#xD;
oned her life.&#xD;
Was there no regret for the past, no apprehension fom&#xD;
the futtlre? No! Blinded and infatuated as this un-&#xD;
'ha~ppy woman was by an aThabsorbing passion, the past&#xD;
was forgotten and the future ignored.&#xD;
To battle with the present, required not only the cour-&#xD;
age of a hero, but the self~sacrificing spirit of a martyr;&#xD;
and human nature was fast yielding beneath the daily&#xD;
~h~cI~s whidi it received..&#xD;
And such is Love! -&#xD;
Or, at least, the ideal love, for which so many hearts&#xD;
are ever. yearning, and which they vainly believe will&#xD;
brin~'them happiness. But is not the - evidence here to&#xD;
the contrary? For wherever love is found, which is nei-&#xD;
ther controlled by reason nor guided by religion, it will&#xD;
have misery fonts companion.&#xD;
Thus a month-a wlmol~ month-dragged 'its weary&#xD;
length aIon~, and it was now but' the day preceding the&#xD;
execution. To say that Mand was distract,~ would fail to&#xD;
convey the slightest conception of the agony which was&#xD;
killing her. She scarcely tasted food; sleep was almost&#xD;
unknown to her; and having grown thinner and pak~m'&#xD;
- day by day, it was difficult to believe that the spectre of&#xD;
*    the present was the beautiful woman of a year ago.&#xD;
But "some gnef~ gnaw deep; some woes are hard tc&#xD;
I  K          ~- k~'~&#xD;
&#xD;
bear;" and upon heart and face of Maiid were dr~wu&#xD;
deep lines, which Time could never obliterate.&#xD;
On this last clay before that horrible sentence should be&#xD;
put into execution,' she thought, if she could only gain&#xD;
access 011CC more to his cell, that she would' yield to h~i~&#xD;
oft-repeated request, and fly with him-no matter where~&#xD;
no matter what the consequences, so she could but save&#xD;
him a felon's death.&#xD;
Wliile she was indulging these gloomy reflections,&#xD;
within the ~prison-walls certain officials were busily en~-&#xD;
gaged in the -final preparations for the execution, which&#xD;
was to take place at sunrise. The gallows-that grim&#xD;
destroyer of human life-threw its dismal shm~dow over&#xD;
the unhappy inmates of that home of misfortune; and&#xD;
even the officers trod softly, and whispered, as though&#xD;
they then stood in the presence of thp dead. The pris4&#xD;
oner was a gentleman, and by his courteous manner had&#xD;
awakened a* sympathy in the hearts of his rough keepers&#xD;
which they rarely felt for any one. But sympathy~buld&#xD;
not stay the law in -its course, nor defraud justice of its'&#xD;
xrictim; so the preparations went sadly on to their com~&#xD;
pletion.&#xD;
Justice! Who talks of justice '~&#xD;
An earthly judge and tribunal! It is ever thus with&#xD;
the works of man, as compared with, the acts of Christ.&#xD;
One scourgeth, the other consoleth; man seeks revenge,&#xD;
but "Jesijs is the Lamb of God, without wrath or judg-.&#xD;
mnents;" and Heaven grart that mercy, and not justice,&#xD;
may be administered in the final day!&#xD;
D'Estaing had waited and watched and hoped, until&#xD;
wai~m~~ ~ vain watdino' waS&#xD;
came despair.  ~             agony, and hi~)in~g be~&#xD;

&#xD;
And still she came not, although each moment s~p~&#xD;
rated them further and further, and brought the hour of&#xD;
execution nearer.&#xD;
it was 110W but twenty-four hours, and, as all hopes of&#xD;
ever seeing the loved again fled from his breast, he wrote&#xD;
her a hurried note, then swallowed a white powder, and,&#xD;
throwing himself upon his cot, whispered,&#xD;
"Farewell, Maud, forever!"&#xD;
Why such haste? Will they never meet again? Ii&#xD;
seems impossible; but who can tell?&#xD;
With a resignation which only contemplated the cessa-&#xD;
tion of the ills of this life, D'Estaing looked calmly on&#xD;
death, and sat, in the darkness of his cell, awaiting its.&#xD;
stealthy approach.&#xD;
The day crept by on leaden feet, and towards nightfall&#xD;
Maud groped forth, and for the' last time approached the&#xD;
gloomy walls of the home of misfortune.&#xD;
Recognizing one of the old guard on duty, a low cry&#xD;
broke from her lips, and, slipping a gold coin in his hand,&#xD;
she inquired if the jailor was restored. Upon hearing&#xD;
that he was, her heart beat high with hope, and she asked&#xD;
the guard to let him know that she was there.&#xD;
"I dare not even speak to him on~the subject," said the&#xD;
guard, as he examined the bright coin he held by the gas-&#xD;
light.&#xD;
*     '~ here's more money for you; and it shall be trebled,'&#xD;
if you will only take me to him," she pleaded.&#xD;
"Impossible!" answered the man, while lie pocketed&#xD;
the gold.&#xD;
her heart sank at these words, and the tears stood in&#xD;
her eyes, as one by one the hopes of a few minutes ago&#xD;
vanished in the gloom which was settling over her hue.&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
TOO LATE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The guard was walking his round again, as she stood&#xD;
gazing at the entrance, and the next moment ~she was&#xD;
hoping again, for her old friend, the jailor, stood within&#xD;
the doorway. It was but the work of an instant, and she&#xD;
was by his side. She seized hold of him, and, in attempt..&#xD;
ing to get rid of her, a terrible scuffle ensued, which&#xD;
resulted in landing them both within the hail. * It was a&#xD;
matter of life and death with one, and of displacement&#xD;
and imprisonment with the other. It was not' strano'e&#xD;
b&#xD;
that the first should win, for anxiety and love gave super-&#xD;
human strength to Maud's delicate limbs, and she cluiig&#xD;
to him with a tenacity which all his force could not extri-&#xD;
cate.&#xD;
"Let me see you but a moment," she pleaded.&#xD;
"Impossible! Let me go, or I ~vihl call a guard, and&#xD;
have you put out!"&#xD;
"Let inc see you alone, just one minute, and then yon&#xD;
may send me away, if you will," still pleaded the kneel-&#xD;
ing woman, as the tears poured down her cheeks.&#xD;
It was dark as midnight in the corridor, and it was for~&#xD;
tunate for both Maud and the sailor that it was, and that&#xD;
there was no one near to hear or see them.&#xD;
The heart of the r5ugh man was touched at last, and,&#xD;
after bolting and barring the door, he turned in the direc-&#xD;
tion of his ofdce, and said,&#xD;
"Come on!" muttering to himself as lie went, " The&#xD;
first mnam~i followed a ~voman to his ruin, and I bet the last&#xD;
man will be doinr the same thing." But gold was tempt~&#xD;
ing, and he was fast getting into a melting' mood Both&#xD;
0&#xD;
having entered his office, he closed and locked the door,&#xD;
and said, rather savagely,&#xD;
"What do you want with me I"&#xD;

TOO LATE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I must see the prisoner."&#xD;
"Impossible!" he said, stamping his foot impatiently&#xD;
on the floor. "I came too near getting a halter around&#xD;
my iieck for letting that last woman in there, and I'll&#xD;
never try it again, so help me -.&#xD;
"But this is different," pleaded Maud. ." I'll make no&#xD;
noise, and no one will ever know that I have been here."&#xD;
"There's no use talking; so you might just as well go."&#xD;
"But think-it is the last night. It is only a few hours&#xD;
until -" But the words died upon her lips, and a&#xD;
fresh burst of tears expressed what she could not utter.&#xD;
K "~ can't help it! And let me tell you, thai all the&#xD;
gol4 in the world could never tempt me to disobey orders&#xD;
again; so you might just as well go at once."&#xD;
- With a woman's quick perception, Maud knew that the&#xD;
time was too precious to be given up to weeping; so,&#xD;
forcing back her tears, she said:&#xD;
"To a man of your kind heart this must be a horrible&#xD;
life you lead."&#xD;
"It is! it is!" he said; a moment after adding, with&#xD;
much feeling, "and God knows, if I could, I would leave&#xD;
it this night, and forever."&#xD;
"Nothin~ easier," said Maud, with a well-assumed air&#xD;
o:f indifference, that was more persuasive than words.&#xD;
"hi God's name, tell me how!" claimedd the man, in&#xD;
a toue of interest and excitement.&#xD;
"Sit down, and I will tell you;" and, leaning across&#xD;
die table, she watched his face closely, as she said: "Sup-&#xD;
pose you had five thousand dollars; what would you do&#xD;
with it?&#xD;
\Vith sparkling eyes, lie said:&#xD;
"O~o to the country, bny me a farm, get - married~ &amp;amp;nd&#xD;

TOO LATE.                311&#xD;
SettlO down. It was with this object in view that I took&#xD;
your gold, and to the. same end that; I endure this devil's.&#xD;
life."&#xD;
"Let me but see the prisoner, and yoa shall have twico&#xD;
flsre thousand."&#xD;
"You jest! "~ he exclaimed, arising from his seat.&#xD;
"As there is a God in heaven, I am in earnest."&#xD;
"But what shQuld I do with it? I should be taken up&#xD;
and ~&#xD;
"Not so. Take the order which I will give you.&#xD;
Escape to-night. Get the money, and leave for parts&#xD;
unknown."&#xD;
"But what will become of you?"&#xD;
"Never mind me. But tell me, quick, if you will do&#xD;
i~ ?&#xD;
"So help me God, I will !"&#xD;
"Thank Heaven!" burst from Maud's lips, as she&#xD;
bowed her head in gratitude upon the table. A minute&#xD;
afterwards, she said, "Give me pen, ink, and paper, and&#xD;
while I write the order, dismiss the guard, and by the&#xD;
time you return I will be ready."&#xD;
handing her the desired writing materials, he shook&#xD;
his head, and, as he left the room, muttered significantly,&#xD;
"A Ii, woman! woman! woman! woman!"&#xD;
During his short absence Maud wrote th~ following&#xD;
note&#xD;
"Il\Iu. BROUGUTON:&#xD;

"P. S.-l{ate Byrd can identify the handwriting.&#xD;
'KM. II"&#xD;
With much difficulty the guard was at length disposed&#xD;
of, aLld after what seemed aii age to Maud, the jailor&#xD;
returned.&#xD;
Giving him the letter, she said,&#xD;
"hi the city of Savannah, Georgia, you will find Mr.&#xD;
Broughton, the gentleman to whom this note is addressed.&#xD;
Make all haste to arrive there; and, having secured the&#xD;
money, make all possible speed to quit the country. My&#xD;
best wishes, and the blessing of God, go with you."&#xD;
lie bowed, and took the letter in silence.&#xD;
"But one more question: If the prisoner will accept&#xD;
his release to.-night, can you, will you, let us escape with&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"I can, and will!" lie promptly answered.&#xD;
"But come-Act 'us be quick, for I fear I am already&#xD;
8llspected by two of the guards."&#xD;
They were now groping, through the long, dark corri~&#xD;
dors, and as' they reached the door the jailor said:'&#xD;
"As soon as the guards are changed at midnight, I will&#xD;
come for you."&#xD;
Another moment, and she was inside the cell; but the&#xD;
deep silence, the stifled air, and the midnight darkness,&#xD;
filled her soul with such gloomy forebodings, that she&#xD;
could not move.&#xD;
As soon 'as her eyes became accustomed to the dark-&#xD;
~ she discovered the~ loved one lying upon his couch,&#xD;
and, by his heavy breathing, fancied he must be asleep.&#xD;
Advancing hastily, she knelt by his side, and whispered,&#xD;
"Alphonse!" But no ~response or recognition c~mQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
TOO LATE.                s13&#xD;
shaking him, she called again, "Alphonse!" But he&#xD;
answered not. Then raising his head, whilst the most&#xD;
terrible a pierced her heart, she wailed forth pite~&#xD;
ously, "Alphonse I what is the matter? Awaken.--it is&#xD;
Maud who calls you!"&#xD;
Rubbing his eyes and opening them for an instant, he&#xD;
murmured, drowsily, as he turned upon his pillow,&#xD;
"iMlaud.!&#xD;
"Alphonse, awaken! I have come to fly with you-~--&#xD;
to take you from this prison-cell, to life and love!"&#xD;
Arousing himself once more, he murmured, brokenly,&#xD;
"Too late! I'm-dying!"&#xD;
"My God! Alphonse, what is the matter? Why do&#xD;
you talk so?" And she bathed his face with hot, ecald~&#xD;
ing tears.&#xD;
Bitt no word escaped his lips, for the poison which he&#xD;
had been taking at intervals during the day was doing its&#xD;
work well, and his life was ebbing . rapidly. Suddenly&#xD;
the truth flashed upon her, and she fell prostrate and&#xD;
fainting upon the floor.&#xD;
What a scene !~-one dying, the other unconseioiis.&#xD;
And this was 'the end of a love which they fancied w~w&#xD;
happiness! Was ever happiness so crowned with thorns?&#xD;
Were ever hearts so crucified? Guilt demands beavy&#xD;
sacrifices as its reward, and, like "knre," will, soon or&#xD;
late, be "its own aveno'er"&#xD;
Determined not 4to die the ignominious d~th to which&#xD;
he had been sentence~, D'Estaing had enlisted the kindly~&#xD;
services of one of the guard, and the man had furnished&#xD;
him the morphine with which he had ended his life. ll&amp;amp;&#xD;

fatal poison.&#xD;
Thus, with his soul fi~ll of guilt, had. he thrust himself&#xD;
uncalled into the presence of his Maker; and God grant&#xD;
he may not have committed the unpardonable sin!&#xD;
The swoon Maud had fallen into did not last long; but&#xD;
when consciousness returned, she was but the victim of&#xD;
fresh lamentations . And as ~he sat there in. the dark,&#xD;
with the loved one dying, she prayed most fervently that&#xD;
she too might die there by his side. Poor, deluded&#xD;
woman! She thought not ~f the eternity-of the end-&#xD;
less~~ges of suffering to which she longed to go. No; it&#xD;
was on.&#xD;
with ly an ove~whelining desire to be rid of the present,&#xD;
all its misei~y and unhappy memories, flier flrst&#xD;
impulse had been to call, the, guard and send for a sur~&#xD;
geon. But then ~ha thought, "No;* it is better so, for he&#xD;
will escape the. horrid execution at snn~ise," Thus,, with&#xD;
one hand pressed upon his heart and th~ other upon his&#xD;
temple, she kept her lonely vigil as his life ebbed slowly&#xD;
away. IIer tears ceased to flow, for the fountain. was&#xD;
exhausted, and only groans escaped her lips, while the&#xD;
old pain was piercing her heart like a dagger. her life&#xD;
was going too, but it was so slowly, so~ wearily I It was&#xD;
like the victims of old~ when, beino' bound to the rack,&#xD;
they were tortured until. life was nearly extinct, then,&#xD;
being unfettered and refreshed, were subjected to new&#xD;
ordeals.&#xD;
It had been thus, for iiionths past. And this was the&#xD;
result of that l6~e for which many hearts are yearning,&#xD;
and for which all ties, areometimes 1~,rokcn, and ~ ,t1i~.&#xD;

not of those she had deserted, or of that Hereaftei' to&#xD;
which she was swiftly going; for the past was forgotten;&#xD;
and the future was a black darkness into which she could&#xD;
not, dared not, penetrate.&#xD;
As she sat there stroking the temples of the dying prism&#xD;
oner, she was suddenly startled by the opening of the&#xD;
door; an~ as the clock then. told twelve, the jailor stood&#xD;
by her side. lie said, in a half-frightened whisper,&#xD;
"Everything is ready; let's be gone."&#xD;
"But I cannot got" said IMlaud. "112)o not wait for me,&#xD;
but go at once."&#xD;
"What! will he not accept his release?"&#xD;
"ile is already released!" And as the wozds left her&#xD;
lips, her head sank upon the breast of the dying man.&#xD;
"Already released! What do ~CLU mean?" exclaimed,&#xD;
the jailer, in surprise.&#xD;
Just then the, heart ceased it~ irregular beats, and she&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Put your hand upon his heart, and feel if it throbs."&#xD;
Doing as he was bidden, without feeling any responsive&#xD;
throb, he said,&#xD;
"My God! have you killed him?"&#xD;
"lleaven.s! no. I found him in this dying condition&#xD;
when. I came, and suppose he must have taken. some kind&#xD;
of poison; and here will I remain until they bear him to&#xD;
his final resting~place."&#xD;
"But you must not! They will accuse you of his&#xD;
death, and hang you. in, his stead."&#xD;
"I wish to God they would!"&#xD;

DEATH IN LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, no! do not talk so,'but fly! Go-leave me! I&#xD;
am only a~ blighted, wretched woman, who is weary of&#xD;
life, and ready to die."&#xD;
"But I will not go, and leave you here to suffer, while&#xD;
lain enjoying your gold."&#xD;
"That does not matter."&#xD;
"But you must go with me. Come,~ now; time is fly-&#xD;
ing, and we may be discovered." And, taking hold of&#xD;
her, he would have forced her from the cell; but she&#xD;
pleaded so for "just one more minute!" Then throwing&#xD;
herself madly across his bosom, she, kissed him a thou.&#xD;
sand farewells, while her burning tears bathed his face,&#xD;
and her heart bled drops of blood. It was an eternal&#xD;
farewell' and God in heaven alone knows to what dark&#xD;
despairing d~ths the human heart can descend without&#xD;
bi~6~kiii~7 What a relief it would have been to have&#xD;
dropped dead at his side! But the curse of suffering is,&#xD;
that the victim must live; and she lived to endure the&#xD;
torture of the damned. She took his hands in hers, and&#xD;
clutched in one was a piece of crumpled paper, which&#xD;
she seized and slipped in her pocket, thinking it might&#xD;
give her sorn~ clue to his death. Then, kissing him one&#xD;
long, last, eternal farewell, she fell fainting in the sailor's&#xD;
arms, and he bore her from the cell forever. Descending.&#xD;
the steps, he soon gained a subterranean passage, through&#xD;
which he ~ with his broken-hearted burden; and,&#xD;
rough man that lie was, he felt glad to ,have her uncon-&#xD;
scious, for he knew thatit was at least momentary relief.&#xD;
Soot ,tl~e~j~ad gained the street; and as lie stopped&#xD;
~:and ~ ced the fragile woman whom he held upon some&#xD;
steps, the night air revived her, and she opened her eyes&#xD;
to realize fully the eterrnd gloom' in which she was en-&#xD;
&#xD;
shrouded. The jailor walked impatiently back and forth,&#xD;
and Iiually ventured to say,&#xD;
"It will never do for us to be seen together."&#xD;
"True," answered Maud; then, tottering forward, she&#xD;
extended her hand, and said,&#xD;
"Good-by! May God bless you!"&#xD;
"But whero are you going?" asked this rough man,&#xD;
anxiously.&#xD;
"Never mind me, but look to your own safety."&#xD;
And as they pressed each other's hands in silence, the&#xD;
tears stood in their eyes, and the jailor felt an uncomfort-&#xD;
able twinge about his heart that was new to him. A&#xD;
moment afterwards, they were lost to view in the dark~.&#xD;
ness, as each one went their appointed way..&#xD;
The cold, pale starlight looked down upon iNland as she&#xD;
wended her weary footsteps to a building which was no&#xD;
stranger to her, and by the pale morning light she was&#xD;
discovered in a prostrate and insensible condition upon&#xD;
the steps of the Convent of St. Madeleine.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLV.&#xD;
DEATH IN LIFE.&#xD;
~ ~ER soul wandered in fill 'table space ;' but if&#xD;
it had drifted beyond th~Thlue ether in which&#xD;
it floated and sank not, it would have been, guilt -~&#xD;
laden as it was, hurled into "outer darkness." Then let&#xD;
not those who are blessed with health atid strength forget,&#xD;

&#xD;
that "in the midst of life" they are "in death." Let&#xD;
them think of it, and make their peace with God before&#xD;
it is too late.&#xD;
The constant strain of the last few months upon a con-&#xD;
stitution naturally delicate had culminated in inflamma-&#xD;
tion of the l)rain, and for three weeks Maud hovered&#xD;
between life and death, with her feet even over the&#xD;
shadowy border of the latter. The delicate weight,&#xD;
which preponderated first on one side and then on the&#xD;
other, at length fell into the scale of life, and she awoke&#xD;
from the long sleep of delirium to find all her hair gone,&#xD;
and her hands so wasted as-to be almost transparent.&#xD;
She was alone, and, on looking a round, instantly recog..&#xD;
~2 nized the little chamber which once before had afforded&#xD;
her shelter. Then, without an effort or desire to recall&#xD;
them, every incident of that last horrible night rushed&#xD;
over her recollection, and, groaning, she covered her face&#xD;
with her hands in a vain attempt to shut out the feai'~&#xD;
fully-remembered picture.&#xD;
Whether it had been one short hour before, or weeks,&#xD;
or months, she could not determine; for to those who,&#xD;
grope in unknown realms, Time is measureless, and&#xD;
months and years but as days.&#xD;
Lying there so still and cold, and passionless and tear~&#xD;
less, those beautiful words of "Lucile" came into her&#xD;
mind, and she whispered to herself:&#xD;
"I            within   t~ieI of life;&#xD;
e4~W4orA~ore  the km  ~'&#xD;
*, She had loved and lost; she had su1~ered the tortures&#xD;
of the rack and the wheel; she had mouriied in sack&#xD;
&#xD;
cloth ~nd ashes; and her penitence had leen worthy ~&#xD;
better cause.&#xD;
Life, with its joys~, its pleasures, its allurements, was&#xD;
over for her now, and weariness and resignation had&#xD;
taken the place of action and striving. Peeling that the&#xD;
end was i~ot far remote, she waited with patience.&#xD;

/ Vi ~' lfhe door was opened softly, and a gentle creature, who&#xD;
had nursed her most tenderly, glided to the bedside.; and&#xD;
as Maid raised her eyes in consciousness to hers for the&#xD;
first time, she smiled, and a gratified expression shone in&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"You are much better?" she said.&#xD;
"Yes, I suppose so-thank you," was the feeble reply~&#xD;
as ~he reached forth her small, thin hand, and grasped&#xD;
that of h~r nurse.&#xD;
"I am very glad; and, with care, you will Soon be&#xD;
well."&#xD;
"I shall never again be well, Sister Agnes," she said,&#xD;
sadly. "'Who can minister to a mind diseased,' or&#xD;
'pltidc frbtn the memory a rooted sorrow?' No, no;&#xD;
here ii~ my h~iu~ is a malady that can never be relieved."&#xD;
"There is One above, who is able to cure all pains, all&#xD;

forgiveness through the Atonement, and He will not cast&#xD;
you off."&#xD;
"Show me the way, Sister Agnes. Lead my guilty&#xD;
footsteps into the right path; and if I find the true God&#xD;
at last, I shall not have lived in vain."&#xD;
"Put your trust in Him, and He will bring all good&#xD;
things to pass. Pray, through faith and in faith; for it&#xD;
is by the prayer of &amp;amp;faith that the ear of God can be&#xD;
reached and His favor secured."&#xD;
And as that humble disciple of the Most High knelt&#xD;
by The sick woman's bedside, they both prayed earnestly&#xD;
that the one aching, blighted heart might rest at last&#xD;
from its reckless waywardness, within the fold of the&#xD;
Eternal. Their intercessions must have found an audb&#xD;
~nce in God; for, in that brief space of time, a peace&#xD;
which lie alone could have given descended upon Maud's&#xD;
heart, and the storm, that had so long raged in her young&#xD;
breast, was lulled into sweet calm.&#xD;
When Sister Agnes arose from her knees, Maud said,&#xD;
"Stoop' down! Bend lower! Let me kiss you, and&#xD;
fold you to my heart. I know God, the God who has&#xD;
spoken peace 'to my soul, will bless and magnify your&#xD;
holy ministrations."&#xD;
"God grant His peace, and give you His mercy and&#xD;
everlasting rest." And, bending over, Sister Agnes,&#xD;
ch~sped 'the emaciated form of Maud in her arms, while&#xD;
soft, refreshingg tears stole down the cheeks of both.&#xD;
Some little time passed in this clinging, tearful, affec~&#xD;
tio~iate embrace, and, again asking God's blessing upon the&#xD;
sufferer, the Sister disengaged her arms, and turned to go~&#xD;
* "Would it trouble you very much to send a dispatch&#xD;
for me?" said Maud.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No trouble at all, child ;-and here I have pencil and&#xD;
paper." And, by Maud's dictation, she wrote:&#xD;
"Miss I(ATE BYRD:&#xD;
"Come 'immediately to the Convent of St. Madeleine,&#xD;
street. Bring Harry with you. It is my dying&#xD;
request."&#xD;
"What signature?" said Sister Agnes, looking up.&#xD;
"None is needed. She will know from whom it comes.&#xD;
Address, 'Care of Mr. W. L. Broughton, Savannah,&#xD;
Georgia'; and please send without delay."&#xD;
"Yes, I will. And. now, if you will drink some of~&#xD;
this port~wine, [think you will be able tQ g~t some&#xD;
refreshing sleep. By the, by, here are your port&amp;amp;.mou.~&#xD;
naie, and a letter which I took from your pocket;" and,&#xD;
handing them to her, she quietly left the 'room.&#xD;
'Tearing open the note, INland read, with straining eyos~&#xD;
the last words penned by the man she had so long~ so&#xD;
madly, so sacrificially loved. She fell back upon her&#xD;
pillow, and folding both hands over her almost ~ti1ed&#xD;
heart, the film of death came over her eyes, and blessed&#xD;
insensibility came to relieve her of her more than death~&#xD;
agony.&#xD;
Enough! There is grief too sacred for disclosure~;&#xD;
and, drawing over this little. alt~,r-chamber the veil' of&#xD;
priv*~cy, the poor bruised reed is left alone with heart and&#xD;

CIIAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
JOI~GIVEN.&#xD;
0 describe all that Kate suffered on account of&#xD;
her absent friend, would be beyond the power of&#xD;
the pen. The telegram brought forth a ferveilt&#xD;
"Thank God ~" A letter from Sister Agnes, which fob&#xD;
lowed the telegram, confirmed her belief in the purity of&#xD;
Maud's life and conduct ~ and the sudden and unexpect-&#xD;
ed appearance of Ooionel Iiartridge startled her into&#xD;
silence. Tired of roaming, heart-sick and weary, he had&#xD;
yielded to an impulse which induced him to return to hi~&#xD;
abandoned home.&#xD;
The meeting between 1~Iate and himself was a sad ot~e.&#xD;
Kate was tearful; he was silent; while beth WerO bowed&#xD;
beneath a weight of agony which ~was more than oppres-&#xD;
sive. Without a word of explanation or apology, she&#xD;
placed the dispatch and the letter of ~ister~ Agnes in his&#xD;
hand; and when he had read them, ho looked up with&#xD;
tu~nttered meaning in his eyes, and simply said,&#xD;
"1 will go with you."&#xD;
Tier preparations for the journey were soon completed,&#xD;
and that afternoon they sailed f~r ~ew York.&#xD;
.     .~           .&#xD;
Between waking and sleeping, and the sad pleasure of&#xD;
seeing Kate once more, the following week flitted by, and&#xD;
was soon numbered with the past. One bright morning&#xD;
towards its end, Thud awoke from a refreshing slumber&#xD;
and a strangely soothing dream, to find Kate, the object&#xD;
of her dreams, standing over her. A low scream of&#xD;
&#xD;
delight burst frofi~ her lip~, ~id in the next in~ta~t they&#xD;
were locked in each other's arms, while a torrent of kisses&#xD;
rained on her lips, brow, and cheeks.&#xD;
"is it you-~-yoit, dear Kate?" she asked, as if rallied&#xD;
doubtilig the evidence of her senses.&#xD;
"Yes-yes, it is, my darling 1" and tears of joy stood&#xD;
in her eyes.&#xD;
Kat&amp;amp;s brow grew clouded and sorrowful at the pale&#xD;
face and weary look of her unfortunate friend, and she&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Why, Maud, did you not let me know where you&#xD;
were, and that you were ill?"&#xD;
Looking up at Kate, she shook her head, and said,&#xD;
"Not one word in reference to th~ past. I canii~t&#xD;
bear it."&#xD;
Kate bowed her head in assent, tears filling her tender&#xD;
eyes and flooding her ~heek~, as she contemplated the&#xD;
wreck of the young life before her.&#xD;
A Wistful look came over Maud's countenance, aiid she&#xD;
said, timidly,.&#xD;
"have you any tidings of Co1on~l llartridge, Kate?"&#xD;
Despite her surpriser Kate's face brightened, and sh~&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"Because, dear, I mii~t s~o him. My days are nurn~&#xD;
bored. I am dying;* and I cannot die in peace until I&#xD;
have asked hi~ forgiveness."&#xD;
"Do not talk ~f dying!" said Kate, sadly, as she bait&#xD;
over and kis~d her hollow, emaciated cheeks, but at~the&#xD;
same tiui~ i~ealh4ng that what she said wa~ fatally true.&#xD;
"Excuse me a xn~ment?" said she, hastily leaving the&#xD;

Very soon the door was opened, and Colonel llartridge&#xD;
entered.&#xD;
With a shriek, Maud sprang to the floor, her guilty&#xD;
conscience conjuring up some apparition which had&#xD;
intruded only to mock her. But as he raised her up,&#xD;
and laid her gently on the bed, the truth flashed upon&#xD;
her, an~1, drawing back, each regarded the other for a&#xD;
moment silently. Then taking D'Estaing's note from&#xD;
under her pillow, she handed it to him, and, with a trem-.&#xD;
bling voice, said,&#xD;
"Read that, and say whether you can for a dying&#xD;
woman?"&#xD;
Opening it his eyes detected the well-knowit 1iarid~&#xD;
writing of his friend, and a film came over his sight, as&#xD;
he read:&#xD;
"I have waited, and had hoped to see you once more,&#xD;
Maud; but we shall never* meet again. I am dying.&#xD;
The death-sealing drug has been kindly furnished me by&#xD;
one of the guard, too merciful to witness my death on&#xD;
the ignominious gallows-tree. Morphine is sure, while it&#xD;
robs dissolution of iiiany of its p~ngs. I am thankful&#xD;
for it. We are none of us very brave, I take it, in this&#xD;
hour. But enough! I only write to urge you to return&#xD;
to your noble husband. Tell him all, and ask his mercy&#xD;
-his forgiveness. Tell him, from me, a dying man, that&#xD;
you are worthy of his love. Your conduct is above all&#xD;
reproach. Tell him, that you oiily came to offer me xny&#xD;
liberty, and nothing more. If he would not believe an&#xD;
assertion you might make upon your own responsibility,&#xD;
he cannot doubt the word of the dying, for the dying are&#xD;
seldom guilty of falsehood or trifling. The day is grow.'&#xD;
&#xD;
FORGIV~.                  82~&#xD;
ing ~1ark around~ me; the light is fading; the shadows&#xD;
thicken! My pulse is growing weaker! I am not&#xD;
afraid there is light at the other end of the valley.&#xD;
God bless you, my poor Maud! Farewell, forever!&#xD;
"D'ESTAING."&#xD;
Ilaxring finished reading the note, Colonel Hartridge&#xD;
looked at Maud thoughtfully.&#xD;
"My wife, you have suffered; and in the more than&#xD;
mortal anguish of this suffering have expiated all offencos&#xD;
ao'ainst your husband. Therefore he forgives you, and,&#xD;
if he knows his own soul, as freely as he hopes to be for-&#xD;
given of God for the sins of the flesh."&#xD;
his language was measured. His words were well and&#xD;
carefully weighed-as well and as carefully weighed as&#xD;
any on record in a Court of Assizes. lIe stood at some&#xD;
distance from her, and his manner was as cold and as&#xD;
undemonstrative as ever. It is true, there '~as then cause&#xD;
for his coldness and haughtiness; but there had not been&#xD;
in the olden thnes, in the early days of their wedded life,&#xD;
when her heart hungered and thirsted for sympathy and&#xD;
tenderness, and when, 'perhaps, these-the love a woman's&#xD;
heart demands, the delicate attentions so flattering to her&#xD;
nature-might have averted the dreadful consequences&#xD;
which sowed their pillows with thorns, and wrecked the&#xD;
lives of both.&#xD;
"I do not deserve this," she said, meekly; "but I felt&#xD;
-I felt---that I could not die in peace until I had craved&#xD;
your pardon for my many offences."&#xD;
" But why talk of dying?" said he, seating himself&#xD;
beside her bed aAd clasping one of her thin white hands&#xD;

in one of his with ~me *armth of mariner. "We will&#xD;
cure you in a little time when we get yon home."&#xD;
"home!" she echoed, sadly, as she opened her dreamy&#xD;
eyes, and stared at him with a look of surprise. "home,&#xD;
did yon say?"&#xD;
"Yes; I said, when we get you home, we will soon&#xD;
have yon in good health again."&#xD;
"I have no home!" she answered, with a long sigh.&#xD;
"You have the same home, ~faud, as that to which you&#xD;
were borne as a bride; the same hearts to welcome you;&#xD;
the same e~y~s to watch over you; the same personal com~&#xD;
forts at command"&#xD;
lie drew nearer, his spirit feeling the mighty lack of&#xD;
her lifetime, and, taking her in his~ arms, ymrmured&#xD;
words of si~ch tenderness, such sympathy, ~ueh contrition,&#xD;
as had never before shaped themselves to his lips; and&#xD;
again and again he kissed her cold, pale brow;. and a&#xD;
single bnrnii~ tear fell upon her cheek, telling in unuP&#xD;
tered eloquence of the smothered heat that dwelt in hi~&#xD;
heart-of his burning, consuming love for her.&#xD;
At first she trembled and wasfrightened at this demon.&#xD;
station of emotion; and then she felt the softening,&#xD;
melth~g influence of his 'warn~, holy passion, upon. her&#xD;
chilled and frozen heart and she wept. The fountain&#xD;
that she fancied locked forever beneath coldness and&#xD;
neglect, burst forth, and the waters were sweet and heal.&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
Jn( the midst of this blissful experience, however,&#xD;
Remorse raised its st6ny visage~ Withdrawing his arms&#xD;
fro~n their clasp upon her form, she looked ~up at him,&#xD;
~t~d then1 ~ting dowi~ her eyes, she said,&#xD;
"I have foffeited all claim to your home, your love.&#xD;
&#xD;
your hearP-Ao all the friends and all the friendships&#xD;
which would welcome me back to my bridabhome."&#xD;
"Will you not let me decide that?" he said.&#xD;
"Pardon me, my husband," she said. "I can never&#xD;
eon~ent to outrage your liable golierosity. I can nevei&#xD;
return!"&#xD;
"But indeed you can!" cried Kate, coming in at that&#xD;
momCnt, gnd hearing hei~ last remark.&#xD;
"Yes, indeed you can!" eeh9ed U~rry Fielder, who,&#xD;
to Mand's surprise, ~entered the room with Kate, and,&#xD;
coming forward, pressed both of her hands in his, and&#xD;
kissed them, with sparkling tears in his honest eyes. "I&#xD;
have not the slightest idea what it is, but, you know, I am&#xD;
always ready to endorse all that Kate says."&#xD;
At a glance Maud saw the happy state of affairs that&#xD;
existed between those two, and with a glad sniiie gave&#xD;
them so to understand.&#xD;
The friends around her noted the smile; but it was&#xD;
soon drowned in a sigh.&#xD;
"Let me die here!"&#xD;
"No!" en~iphatically said Colonel llartridge.&#xD;
"No! no!" eri~d Kate.&#xD;
"'No! no! no!" cried harry Fielder.&#xD;
She placed h~r hand iii that of her husband.&#xD;
"I will go with you."&#xD;
"It is well!" said Colonel llartridge, with deep meau~.&#xD;

The parthig botw6en Mau~d and her gentle nurses was&#xD;
a sad one. H~r love of the w&amp;amp;rld had been fearfully&#xD;
exorcised,~ and she had thought to give up herself in&#xD;

her days, be they Lew or many, within those cloistered&#xD;
walls, and from those godly women learn to forget the&#xD;
vanities of the outer world, and to do good for the siim&#xD;
pie love she 'bore to the Author of all good.&#xD;
But it was not to be so. The same evening, as the&#xD;
gray shades of night drove from nature the purple&#xD;
shadows of twilight, and the stars peeped forth, they saw&#xD;
them all homeward-bound, and Maud not unwillingly.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVII.&#xD;
~HOME AGAIN ~&#xD;
"'Mid all these, how small one grief-.&#xD;
One wrecked heart whose hopes are o'er!~,&#xD;
LL life is a tragedy," says Carlyle; and as the&#xD;
curtain was so soon to fall upon "one wrecked&#xD;
heart whdse hopes were o'er," there remaii~s&#xD;
little else to be told. She was at "home again," but&#xD;
home to her no more; and strive as she did against&#xD;
she felt like an intruder within those walls. There ~he&#xD;
was, in. the same room to which she was brought as a&#xD;
bride, and wl4ieii life was spread out before her in an end-&#xD;
less panorama of beauty and sunlight. Looking from a&#xD;
bow~window into which her lounge had ~been rolled, she&#xD;
gazed upon the Pulaski monument, and her eyes then&#xD;
wandered on into the lovely park beyond, where innocent&#xD;
children, beautiful women, and stately men strolled leis.&#xD;
&#xD;
"hOME A4MIN?"               329*&#xD;
urely. The merry laughter of the little ~es fell like&#xD;
music upon her weary 'heart, and the men and women all&#xD;
looked so happy. But were they happy? Was there no&#xD;
skeleton in their hearts?&#xD;
"Into each life some rain must fall;&#xD;
Some days must be dark and dreary."&#xD;
But she hoped they were h~ppy, even if the shadows.&#xD;
were growing longer and deep er across her own pathway.&#xD;
It was not quite three years ago, and, yet it seemed like&#xD;
ages, sand the beautiful dreams of ,her bridal days van~&#xD;
ished out of sight, down the dreary vista of storms that&#xD;
had raged around her bark.&#xD;
Growing weary of gazing upon scenes which only&#xD;
recalled painful memories, she drew the curtains, and,&#xD;
turning over, closed her eyes.&#xD;
It was not to sleep, though; and, laying there, she&#xD;
thought,&#xD;
"Well, let it be. It is all over now, and can't be&#xD;
helped. Regrets are unavailing, and repinings are sinful.&#xD;
And perhaps, after all, nothing but the chastening rod&#xD;
under which I haye writhed would have ever brought me&#xD;
to the feet of Jesus. here, with a resignation which is&#xD;
only surpassed by my faith, do I kifeel, and pray that I&#xD;
may find, a home beyond the skies, eternal in the heav-&#xD;
ens.,,&#xD;
Growing weaker day by day, she knew full well that&#xD;
the end was near. Colonel Ilartridge and Kate, and Dr.&#xD;
Dnpr6e, all endeavored to cheer her with the prospect of&#xD;
being well again; but she and her "tired heart" felt that&#xD;
their weary pilgrimage was near its close. Fer the sake&#xD;
of those dear ones who watched h~r so tenderly, she&#xD;
