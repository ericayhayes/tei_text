            <p>Are now comprised in three volumes, uniformly bound, price $1.50, each sold

            <p>To say that these criticisms of ORPHEUS C. KERR are universally known, admired, and
               laughed over, would be superfluous. Their inimitable wit and sarcasm have made the
               author famous, and since his letters have been published in book form their
               circulation on both sides the Atlantic has been enormous. Copies will be sent by mail

               <p>"A FEW words by way of introduction,"—as an author frequently remarks, with much
                  native ease of manner, when about to astonish such weak-mined readers as peruse

               <p>Instruction as to the finely subtle significance of certain passages in the
                  appended work, which but for such explanation might seem to have no particular
                  meaning at all, is, of course, the apparent purpose of those few words; but, in a
                  majority of cases, it is their genuine intent to hint, very clearly, that the
                  author of the book should not be ignominiously forgotten in the book itself, and
                  that he takes this opportunity to step casually before the curtain of chapter I.,
                  and be modestly surprised at the ensuing applause.</p>
               <p>Having devised the sinister plain of inserting his signature a full score of times
                  in the historical volume which is herewith submitted to the public at a remarkably
                  low price, the present writer may forego the solemnity of such sentences as, "The
                  more thoughtful reader scarcely need<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7328-00000006"/> be
                  told that the following pages have a deeper," etc. "Something beyond the mere
                  frivolous amusement of an idle hour is intended by," etc. He may also venture to
                  stop addressing "the reader" in terms (inasmuch as that poor-spirited title
                  applies as well to editors, studious inmates of charitable institutions, and other
                  persons, who never pay for books, as to the really solvent individual who
                  patronizes the bookseller), and inscribe what he has here in store to the honest
                  retail book-buyer.</p>
               <p>As the honest retail book-buyer now scanning this page has, presumedly, committed
                  himself beyond all redemption by paying for the volume beforehand, it is scarcely
                  worth while to treat even him with any particular ceremony; and if he absence of
                  any farther propitiatory phrases should happen to strike him as a sign of
                  disrespect, he is hereby coldly authorized to get back his money—if he can.
                  Nothing being certain in this world, however, and the failure of a high-handed
                  outrage of the latter kind coming within the range of human possibilities, it is
                  to be hoped, for the sake of his family, that he will not make a fool of himself
                  in the event of ill success, but quietly submit to the inevitable and go on with
                  his reading. He has the book, the bookseller will not take it back again; and if
                  his bad temper thereat <emph>must</emph> have some vent, let him seize the first
                  opportunity to recommend a similar purchase to his mother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Not to trifle with the miserable man any longer, and supposing his possession of
                  any intelligence whatever to be purely a matter of vague conjecture, let it be
                  explained for his instruction, that when his superiors wish to behold an Eclipse
                  of the Sun, or any other solar entertainment, without injury to their eyes, they
                  use Glass which has been Smoked; and that this sensible medium of astronomical
                  vision not only protects the human sight from harmful confusion of objects, but
                  also presents to it the celestial luminary freed from all extraneous glare and
                  rigidly reduced to his true proportions. Viewed through such a medium, the
                  gorgeous, blazing sun, undergoing eclipse, looks lamentably like an apothecary's
                  most lurid show-bottle suffering serious encroachment from a dinner-pot, and the
                  revelation is calculated to impress feeble minds with the conviction that all is
                  not sun that glitters. Taking his idea from the device and its popular effects,
                  the author of the present volume has, for seven years past, studied a variety of
                  our most dazzling national achievements through a piece of Smoked Glass, with
                  results not less actually strengthening to the eye than astonishingly lessening to
                  the brilliance and apparent magnitude of the military and political pageants
                  surveyed. The ingenuous mind becomes positively confounded at the singularly
                  minute proportions to which much of the most brilliant generalship, patriotism,
                  and statemanship is reduced, when thus stripped of the refractions of partisan
                  prejudice and journalism, and commended in its simple realities to the undazzled
                  sight. To such pitifully small objects, indeed are they often resolved by the
                  process, that a record<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7328-00000007"/> of them in
                  relatively diminished terms might fail to make them visible at all; and, hence, to
                  render them clearly perceptible to others, the recorder is compelled to magnify,
                  or, as the critical cant goes, exaggerate them.</p>
               <p>So far as Burlesque means Perversion or Distortion of facts, the pages of this
                  book do not come properly under that name. The flaw in the iron of the boiler
                  which holds the really great peril of future explosion is that which the
                  magnifying glass only can detect; and the flaws in Patriotism and Statesmanship,
                  which most seriously menace the stability of a nation, must be magnified (or
                  exaggerated, if you will) to the capacity of popular vision, in order that they
                  may be recognized in time. The writer has precipitated brilliant events and
                  personalities, in Washington and in the South, through a carefully prepared piece
                  of Smoked Glass, and then magnified the reduced precipitates only so much as was
                  requisite to make their organic characteristics patent to the weakest sight. Thus,
                  the pageant of Impeachment is truly given as the culminative scene of a feud
                  between Representative THADDEUS Stevens and President ANDREW Johnson; the able and
                  dexterous Opening Argument of Manager B. F. Butler is presented in its absolute
                  meaning, rather than in its ostensible design; the pomp of the presiding Chief
                  Justice is shown to have been coldly tolerated, rather than in any sense
                  practically respected; the passiveness of the nation is shorn of its philosophical
                  lustre and explained in its true significance; the patriotic vehemence of partisan
                  journalism ism of to-day is set forth as it will be judged to-morrow; and the lame
                  conclusion of the drama is attributed to a cause at least as credible and
                  apparently logical as the one generally assigned for it. The same fidelity to
                  concrete actuality may be asserted for the sketches of such representative
                  sectional characters as Captain Villiam Brown, from cosmopolitan New York; the
                  conservative, from Kentucky; the solid Boston man; the loyal Southern Munchausen,
                  etc; and if, in treating of the concentrative national life at Washington, the
                  author has not felt at liberty to ignore the notorious local coloring which
                  sometimes comes in bottles, he has, at least, involved it in a tenderness of
                  phraseology which should not offend the most decorous.</p>
               <p>Recalling the honest retail book-buyer to the stand, and once more sneering at his
                  palpable stupidity in requiring so much prefatory explanation, it may be hinted,
                  that the description of Reconstructional life in the Southern comic States, is
                  intended as a logical sequel to the first half of the history. When not beheld
                  through a piece of Smoked Glass, the South has hitherto presented an effulgence of
                  lordly state and chivalry which few dreamed of attributing to the inordinate
                  reflection and refraction of female novelists and heavy mortgages. Even before the
                  rebellion, a well-smoked glass would have enabled the thoughtful observed to trace
                  much over-dazzling to the latter; but now, the same medium diminishes a race of
                  haughty cavaliers to a community of woefully attired impecuniaires<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000008"/> aires, and reveals their growing eclipse by empty
                  dinner-pots under the delays of Reconstruction. Only the other day, the writer
                  received from a person signing himself "Lucius Natura" a curious anatomical
                  drawing, of which the following is a fac-simile:— <figure/> Accompanying which was
                  a letter, wherein Lucius declared that a friend, in Georgia, had sent him from
                  that State the fossil remain indicated by the <emph>shaded part of</emph> the
                  drawing, and that, from thence, he (Lucius) had, by zoölogical induction, supplied
                  other portions of the extinct animal. "My immediate impression," wrote Lucius,
                  "was that the fossil (dug up in the extreme South, by-the-by) was nothing more
                  than the hinder portions of some enormous dog (GENUS—<foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >Canius tremendibus</foreign>—Linnæus), which is represented by the symbol K.
                  I.—a fallacy. I next assigned it to the Beaver tribe (GENUS—<foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">Tilelus</foreign>—Buffon; or <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >Plugus</foreign>—Descartes; or, perhaps, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Nobus
                     Coveræ.</foreign>) By unmistakable indications, I perceived that the animal was
                  assimilated to the lowest <emph>rodents</emph> which, says Cuvier, are possessed
                  of the least intelligence of all.</p>
               <p>"Goldsmith says: 'The beaver seems to be now the only remaining monument of brutal
                  society. From the results of its labors, <emph>which are still to be seen in the
                     remote parts of America</emph> we learn how far instinct can be aided by
                  imitation. We from thence perceive to what degree animals, without . . . . reason,
                  can concur for their mutual advantage. . . . . When alone, the beaver has but
                  little industry, . . . . and is without cunning sufficient to guard it against the
                  most obvious and bungling snares laid for it.'</p>
               <p>"In short, I am sure that my construction of the animal is correct, and that it
                  belongs to the beaver tribe."</p>
               <p>The present historian was much pleased with his triumph of the naturalist, and
                  particularly admired the mild eye of the restored animal; but happening to think
                  of his Smoked Glass, he quickly brought that to bear upon<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000009"/> on the drawing, and was astounded to discover that
                  the reconstructed fossil was nothing more than a Map of Virginia, the Carolinas,
                  Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi, taken apart from the rest of the
                  country and turned on end; and that the mild eye merely indicated the capital of
                  the first-named State.</p>
               <p>From this, it will be perceived, that the Southern comic States have no protection
                  from outrage, while Reconstruction, from whatever cause, is delayed. As the writer
                  knows, from recent personal observation, though a proper medium, at Chipmunk Court
                  House. they yearn eagerly for peace, and the withdrawal of our military vandals;
                  they desire early investments of Northern Capital with them on good bond and
                  mortgage; and, now that the fiercest gust of passion is over, the more advanced of
                  them would even prefer the supremacy of the African, to being ruled, like us of
                  the North, by the Corkasian.</p>

               <p>NOW that old Winter has been impeached, on charge of poking his snows into all
                  manner of things, and despotically endeavoring to bring our whole excellent
                  Republican organization to its sneeze; now that icicles, like D. Sickles, have
                  ceased being hangers-on around the House, and gone to vapor all about the country;

                  a veil of fog now and then to study the effect; and it is also pleasant to travel,
                  at this dustless season of the year, especially after you have passed beyond the
                  limits of New Jersey.</p>
               <p>Whoever has made the passage to this city, my boy, must have noticed that, soon
                  after the starting of the train from New York, all the passengers became
                     inexpressibly<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7328-00000010"/> melancholy of visage,
                  and devoted the most absorbing attention to the extreme backs of the hats on the
                  next seat. If some innocent foreigner, or other emigrant, in the car, chanced
                  (while hastily flying from the water-cooler under the impression that it was the
                  boiler) to remark upon this freak of nature, the nearest native exclaimed, in a
                  chilling whisper: "Hush! Mr. Hepworth Dixon,<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"

                  look out of the windows we shall be CHARGED for it." Whereupon a deep shudder of
                  terror ran through the entire vehicle, and Mr. Dixon made a memorandum in his
                  note-book, to say, in his next exciting volume on "America," that the Jerseymen
                  all had "Spiritual Wives," and allowed no through-passengers to look into their

                  of engaging English journals; but the day will come—mark me, scoffer!—the day will
                  come, when her name shall appear in every dictionary in the world—as a synonym for
                  "Economy."</p>
               <p>The vegetable interests of my dining-table made me acquainted, last summer, with a
                  Jerseyman of innumerable cucumbers; and, after recovering from the cholera which
                  he had sole me at not more than the usual friendly percentage over the highest
                  market-price, I went to his place to board, for the recovery of my health, at
                  rather more per-week than an own mother-in-law would have charged. He was a
                  Jerseyman, full of deep love for nature, especially when she could be sold for so
                  much a load, a basket, or a small measure; and was even so fond of animated
                  creatures that he cheerfully encouraged all his neighbors to keep chickens, and
                  buy corn for them from him. "And those sweet little English sparrows that are
                  flying about now-a-days," says he to me,—"I love them because they are the works
                  of my Maker; and I see that five hundred of them are advertised for, to be taken
                  West, for which a reasonable sum would be paid. How can I encourage the pretty
                  creeturs to flutter softly about my door?" Much moved by his beautiful enthusiasm,
                  I suggested that a little bird-seed, placed upon a board, would attract the
                  valuable warblers. He smiled feebly at me, and says he: "The seed would cost
                  something and I'm afeared they'd eat it. I suppose you haven't got a little seed
                  about you, that you'd let me have, without wanting it deducted from your board?"
                  Of course I had not; and for a whole week that admirer of the feathered works of
                  his Maker was a mournful man. Suddenly, however, he brightened again amazingly;
                  and early one morning, when an astounding twittering had called me to the front of
                  the house, I found him cheerfully laughing to himself under a board upon a<pb
                     n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7328-00000011"/> widow-sill, around which some scores of
                  sparrows were making much melody. "What!" exclaimed I, "have you rally bought the
                  seed at last, and put it on the sill? How could you afford it?" He caught me by
                  the lappel of my coat, and slapped his leg, gleefully; and says he: "H'sh—sh!
                  don't speak so that they can hear. There's some seed up there, to be sure; BUT
                  I'VE GLUED IT FAST TO THE BOARD!"</p>
               <p>perhaps I should not have remembered the circumstance, but for the fact the
                  representative of that same gentleman's district in Congress is about to present
                  his State's retraction of her former assent to the only civilized Constitutional

                  find the golden "mean."</p>

               <p>Pondering this reminiscence en route, I succeeded in reaching the Capital without
                  experiencing that unnatural disposition to mid-day slumber, which generally
                  attends the intervening approach to Philadelphia on the way. Philadelphia produces
                  some very creditable firemen, and will probably be q quite lively place when the
                  final conflagration of things occurs; but, in the mean time, it curiously
                  resembles some of those placid California fruits, which will keep growing larger
                  and larger just so long as you choose to leave them alone, and are seldom troubled
                  with enough distinctive flavor to tell whether they were ordinary pumpkins, or
                  extraordinary apples.</p>
               <p>Once again established in Washington, and in my old room at Willard's, I find
                  little of merely local importance to note immediately, save, perhaps, the number

                  numerous Pardons at his expense. These haughty nobleman are quite affable once
                  more in general society, and seem ready to negotiate fresh mortgages even with
                  rich reptiles from New England; yet it cannot be denied that they still look with
                  eyes of fire upon such of our national vandals in military attire as they chance
                  to behold around the War Office.</p>
               <p>But if the well-known Southern Confederacy has reason to feel more or less
                  indignation against our former strategic national troops for exploding the
                  incendiary musket against her, she may find much inexpressible comfort, my boy, in
                  contemplating the dreadful retribution now visited upon the head of the last
                  General of the Mackerel Brigade by the pleasing emissaries of an incorrigible
                  daily press. The other day, an affable and exhaustive correspondent of one of our
                  more exiting morning journals, having learned that the General was under orders to
                  become President of use United States in 1869, went cheerfully to his private
                  residence to make inquiries concerning his character and ascertain his views of
                  the freed-negro race. Reaching the chamber of the great, man, where the<pb
                     n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7328-00000012"/> latter sat practising upon the accordion,
                  this gifted and friendly correspondent first glanced over two or three private
                  letters, which were lying upon a desk near the window, and then says he,—</p>
               <p>"Although attached to a journal which gains ten thousand in circulation per week,
                  I am inclined to regard you as an equal, and shall only publish such portions of
                  your correspondence with your family as may be interesting to our female readers.
                  I find here," says he, opening a drawer in the desk, and smiling agreeably, "a
                  penknife, with which I will pare my nails, while asking you such questions as the
                  nation is determined to have answered. Firstly: What is your income for the
                  current year, and how is your grandmother's sprained ankle?"</p>
               <p>The veteran attentively regarded the middle knuckle of his right hand, and
                  performed "Ever of Thee," on the accordion.</p>
               <p>"I see," went on this cheerful correspondent, "that your servant has just brought
                  in your breakfast, and I don't know but I <emph>will</emph> try one of those eggs
                  myself. While I am eating I shall trouble you to tell me what you spend a year for
                  clothes, and also what property your wife brought you. The people of the country
                  are naturally anxious to have these matters clearly explained at once, and any
                  equivocation will tend only to depreciate our bonds abroad, and disappoint a
                  legitimate curiosity at home."</p>
               <p>The great soldier fixed glance earnestly upon a spot near the middle of the
                  ceiling, and executed "Oh, ask me not," with dreamy effect.</p>
               <p>"I will try one of your cigars, for a change," said the able correspondent, going
                  to the box on the self; "and while I am looking for a match in the pocket of that
                  waistcoat of yours, hanging on that nail you might tell me how many marriageable
                  nieces you have; and also, how much you contribute toward the support of your
                  unmarried aunt. The general public will scarcely be satisfied wit anything but the
                  most direct replies to these queries; and if you will also inform me what you gave
                  for your last dozen of shirts, I shall feel obliged."</p>
               <p>The hero now took a deep interest in the left-hand corner of the table near him,
                  and softly evolved, "Come rest in this Bosom," from his eloquent instrument of
                  music.</p>
               <p>"You are doubtless quite ready," continued this engaging correspondent,
                  abstractedly dressing his hair with a comb brush from the bureau, "to state how
                  much you allow your wife for keeping house, and how much you expect to make this
                  year. Upon these points, of course, your fellow-countrymen expect explicit
                  information nor must I forget to ask how you stand regarding the extension of
                  suffrage to the freed-negro race?"</p>
               <p>Here the famous veteran slowly arose from his chair, carefully laid his accordion
                  upon the table, and—winked. Then he quietly lifted a cat from the floor,
                  deliberately blew a ridge in her fur, and dexterously extracted therefrom<pb
                     n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7328-00000013"/> from, with thumb and finger, an agile
                  triumph of the insect kingdom. Thus supplied, he advanced upon the affable and
                  exhaustive correspondent, led him smilingly to the door by an arm, delicately
                  deposited the insect in his right ear, and closed the interview.</p>
               <p>And this subject naturally leads me to consider the "Grand Mackerel Army of the
                  Republic," which was organized here on Tuesday evening, by certain officers of the
                  great strategic Brigade, and the inaugural meeting of which I had the honor to
                  attend, The organization is for the purpose of promoting the Presidency of the
                  above General, keeping alive the memory of those feats of arms and legs, without
                  which we should not now be on hand as a nation, and securing for the political
                  recognition so necessary to persons who propose becoming governors, post master,
                  or successful clergymen. The meeting was held in the immediate neighborhood of a
                  bar-room; so that, in case of fire, water might be readily attainable; and I was
                  pleased to exchange greetings once more with Captains Villiam Brown and Samyule
                  Sa-mith, Sergeant O'Pake, and the thoughtful Mackerel Chaplain.</p>
               <p>The object of the organization having been stated by a waiter, and the memory of
                  those of our comrades who have married since the war having been drank in silence,
                  the next toast in order was,—</p>
               <p>"Our Native Land."</p>
               <p>To this Sergeant O'Pake responded. He said that our Native Land was open to all
                  Irishmen, whether they came from Italy, Poland, or Hungary; and that even to
                  Americans it offered some advantages. When we spoke of our Native Land, however,
                  we particularly meant the refuge of the foreign martyr of freedom; of him who
                  believed that Man <emph>must</emph> be Free, no matter what he was indicted for,
                  and never hesitated to break jail in demonstration of that immortal truth. He—the
                  speaker—could not better answer the last, toast, than by presenting a rhythmical
                  statement of the woes of the general foreign refugee of Freedom; and, while giving
                  the body of the sad tale in Irish, that it might seem more like home to Americans,
                  he had also sufficiently flavored the strain with various foreign tongues to make
                  it suit the general and everlasting martyr of tyranny. He begged leave, therefore,
                  to recite,—</p>

               <p>After we had all applauded the touching verses as well as our tears of sympathy
                  would permit, and expressed our sincere regret that we could not all be Irishmen,
                  the next toast was offered,—</p>
               <p>"The Last General of the Mackerel Brigade—Our next President."</p>
               <p>As I had been selected to honor this sentiment, and really knew no presidential
                  qualification that the General possessed, save his well-known fondness for
                  horse-flesh (and consequent supposable understanding of the common wheel), I
                  merely paid a passing tribute to this skill with the accordion and related a story
                  of that horse-y State,</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>VERMONT.</head>
                  <p>Possibly you have never happened to hear of such a town as Twinkleton before;
                     and so I am careful to state that it is within sound of the whistle of the
                     train that "breaks-up" at Bellows Falls, Vermont, and that its principal hotel
                     for man and beast is somewhat afflictive to the digestions of those travellers
                     whose stomachs look upon apple-pie three times a day as something in the nature
                     of a persecution. You say to the stage-driver, at the railway station, that you
                     wish to go to Twinkleton; and, if you happen to wear a scarf-pin with the head
                     of a coral horse upon it, he will induce you, be a series of the most ingenious
                     devices, to distrust the comfort of the "insides," and ride the box with
                     him.</p>
                  <p>"Yor're going to buy a horse up there," says he, turning ing the reins in his
                     hand, and glancing from your scarf-pin to your city hat.</p>
                  <p>"No, sir!" you say, rather, sharply; for you have an idea that you look vastly
                     above anything horsey, and wish your general get-up to be considered
                     impressive.</p>
                  <p>"Well, then," says the driver, "of course you must be going to 'Squire Maple's
                     so there's no use of my talking to you about that ere nigh-pacing mare, I
                     s'pose."</p>
                  <p>He can't conceive the possibility, can't the driver, of any other destination
                     for you in Twinkleton than 'Squire Maple's and you instinctively feel that a
                     request on your part to be put down at any other mansion, or at the hotel,
                     would at once entail upon you the suspicion of coming to buy a horse secretly,
                     and subject you to some pretty heavy boring in regard to the nigh-pacing
                     mare.</p>
                  <p>Such a state of things will seem indicate that no masculine visitor to
                     Twinkleton is safe from buying as horse, unless he stops at 'Squire Maple's.
                     This is true; and I defy any unarmed single gentleman of my acquaintance to
                     pass a night in Twinkleton without having a steed forcibly sold to him by
                     somebody before morning. In a wider sense, it will seem to indicate that
                     'Squire Maple's is the mansion of Twinkleton. This also is true. and makes me
                     quite anxious to lead my friends thither without further preface.</p>
                  <p>Taking upon ourselves mantles of invisibility, we boldly enter the hospitable
                     door of this celebrated house and are quite surprised to find host, hostess,
                     daughters and a<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7328-00000016"/> young-man visitor
                     named young Mr. Blinders, very heartily welcoming that delicious specimen of a
                     girl who came up in the stage with us.</p>
                  <p>"My dear Maggie Pye," say both of the old folks at once, "we're <emph>so</emph>
                     glad to see you. How <emph>did</emph> you leave pa and ma? Mr. Blinders, this
                     is our niece from New York, Miss Pye."</p>
                  <p>Young Mr. Blinders ducks his head with great emotion, turns very red in the
                     face, and puts both of his hands still deeper into his pockets.</p>
                  <p>A smile of rather cruel amusement is beginning to curl brightly from the
                     corners of Miss Pye's charming mouth, when her cousins, Cassandra and Minerva,
                     commence to tear off her "things," like affectionate young wild-cats, and she
                     permits Mr. Blinders to go uncrushed for the nonce.</p>
                  <p>Questions, answers, and hugs run riot for ten minutes; after which there is a
                     hasty washing of hands and smoothing of lacks, and then dinner is officially
                     announced by a young woman who has seen better days,—or, at least, days when
                     there would not be many plates to wash.</p>
                  <p>The table is substantially and generously furnished though, perhaps, the
                     presence of doughnuts as an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entrée</foreign> and
                     apple-pie as a vegetable, night not be considered orthodox in Fifth Avenue. It
                     is a table to make one feel at a glance that the natural act of eating is a
                     plain, honest, hearty act, not to be entered upon with any mawkish pretences of
                     bird-like pecking. Down they all sit, and the 'squire helps to corned pork and
                     doughnuts all around; after which delicate operation he starts up the talk.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Maggie, did you have a nice ride up? I wonder whether George drove the
                     roans, or the grays, to-day?"</p>
                  <p>"The roans—I seen 'em."</p>
                  <p>This from young Mr. Blinders, who is immediately conscious of having committed
                     an indiscretion, and knocks over a tumbler of water with his elbow by way of
                     helping matters.</p>
                  <p>"Is George the driver's name? says Maggie. "Why! don't you think, uncle, he
                     thought I was coming to Twinkleton to buy a horse and confidentially offered to
                     sell me a pacing mare!"</p>
                  <p>"O Cassandry!" says Minerva, appealing to her sister, "only think of Mag's
                     buying a horse out of her own pocket!"</p>
                  <p>He! he! from Minerva, to accompany the ha! ha! of 'Squire Maple, to accompany
                     the hor! hor! hor! of young Mr. Blinders.</p>
                  <p>"Well, I tell you what it is girls," says Maggie, shaking her curls; "pa's
                     given me a hundred dollars to spend, and I'm more than half a mind to buy a
                     dear angel of a saddle-horse with it. I do love horseback riding
                        <emph>so</emph> much, and our coupé horses aint fit."</p>
                  <p>"I say, Miss Pye—"</p>
                  <p>This from young Mr. Blinders, whose speech is suddenly checked by a nudge from
                     Miss Minerva, and a magical<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7328-00000017"/> ical
                     removal of his pocket-handkerchief from the table to his pocket.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Maggie, my girl," says the 'squire, "I consider myself responsible for you
                     now, and shan't let you run through your fortune in that way."</p>
                  <p>Miss Pye is about to respond with some playful defiance, when she is surprised
                     at receiving a most sinister and complicated wink from the right eye of young
                     Mr. Blinders.</p>
                  <p>The impudent booby! she thinks. How dare he! But she is too good-natured to
                     take serious offence, and begins to plan some choice fun at his expense.</p>
                  <p>Dinner is over, and young Mr. Blinders lingers around the room in speechless
                     clumsiness until the chatter becomes deafening, when he springs convulsively
                     from his chair makes a gape a at Miss Pye, as though about to utter something
                     remarkable, and then goes home.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon his peculiarities are all picked to pieces, as are those of all
                     gentlemen who have just left the company of ladies; and Miss Maggie Pye
                     rollickingly avows that she has made a conquest of him already, and intends to
                     do him brown. The Misses Cassandra and Minerva make a show of defending him;
                     but the general conclusion is, the warning of all presumptuous young men. It is
                     nearly eleven o'clock, P. M., when the question is finally settled and then all
                     the little dears retire to a double-bedded dormitory mitory upstairs, and in a
                     vivacious discussion of the Fashions talk themselves delightfully to sleep.</p>
                  <p>Next day young Mr. Blinders comes to dinner again, and lingers through the
                     afternoon, and manages to ask Miss Pye, in a blood-curdling whisper if she is
                     "going to be scared out of it by them Mapleses?"</p>
                  <p>In utter bewilderment Maggie is about to come out with a Good gracious me! when
                     young Mr. Blinders abruptly bolts out of the house, and leaves subsequent
                     laughter to serve as a flattering comment on his fragmentary style of wooing.
                     Oh, such a goose!</p>
                  <p>On the following morning, however, he comes not long after breakfast, when the
                     Misses Cassandra and Minerva—whose excellent parents <emph>will</emph>
                     pronounce their names as though spelled with a final <hi rend="i"/>y—artfully
                     manage to leave Miss Pye alone in the dining-room with him.</p>
                  <p>Five minutes,—ten minutes,—fifteen minutes,—and the front door is hear to close
                     after somebody, and Miss Pye comes tearing upstairs to the girls' room with her
                     curls fairly on end.</p>
                  <p>"O Cassy and Minny!" says she, "it' too funny! What do you think? He's asked me
                     to elope with him, and I've agreed!"</p>
                  <p>"What!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes! says he to me, 'I say, Miss Pye, you aint a going to be watched and
                     governed by these Mapleses—be ye?' Of course I told him 'No!! And then says
                     he—oh, dear, it's too funny, tough!—says he, 'Then<pb n="34-35"
                        xml:id="VAC7328-00000018"/> all you've got to do is to meet me out at the
                     road-gate to-night after the Mapleses is abed, and then we'll take the liberty
                     of doing as we please, with our own horse and our own money.' Now girls, we
                     must keep up the fun, you know; and I want both of you to hide behind those two
                     poplars down by the gate to-night and hear me rig your country beau."</p>
                  <p>The Misses cassandra and Minerva are at first disposed to decline any part in
                     such conspiracy; but remember in time that they have been called "these
                     Mapleses" as well as their parents, and determine to witness the downfall.</p>
                  <p>Night comes; seven o'clock' eight, ma goes to bed; nine o'clock, pa says he
                     must go to bed; ten o'clock and pa <emph>does</emph> go to bed. Half-past ten
                     o'clock and the Misses Cassandra and Minerva are behind the poplars, and Miss
                     Pye is at the appointed gate. In five minutes there after young Mr. Blinders
                     suddenly emerges from the dense shade of two trees across the road, and
                     cautiously approaches the wicket.</p>
                  <p>"I say, Miss Pye!" in a whisper.</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir," responds maggie, timidly, quite alarmed for a moment as the
                     magnitude of her joke flashes upon her.</p>
                  <p>"Shall we go to him, or shall I bring him here?" whispers young Mr. Blinders,
                     with great self-possession.</p>
                  <p>He means the clergyman, thinks Miss Pye. I ought to be ashamed of myself to
                     fool the poor fellow so, I declare clare; but I'll put him out of his misery at
                     once, and as delicately as I can.</p>
                  <p>"No, Mr. Blinders," she says, "I cannot go with you, In an affair of this kind
                     my parents should be consulted—"</p>
                  <p>"I say, Miss Pye," interrupts young Mr. Blinders, 'it's only them Mapleses that
                     could come between us in this, and it aint none of their business, anyhow. All
                     I ask is the hundred dollars that old Maples wanted to be responsible for You
                     know?"</p>
                  <p>"Sir!" says Miss Pye, horror-stricken at such mercenary frankness.</p>
                  <p>"Just let me show him to you, you know. I've got him nigh under that tree over
                     there," says young Mr. Blinders, incoherently.</p>
                  <p>"Him? What <emph>do</emph> you mean?" shrieks Miss Pye.</p>
                  <p>"Mean?" says young Mr. Blinders, "why, just the very saddle-horse for your
                     hundred dollars."</p>
                  <p>"I thought you wanted to run away with me!" screamed Miss Pye, quite forgetting
                     herself.</p>
                  <p>There is sound in the air as of the emphatic naming of a Holy City of the
                     Orient; in fact, the emphasized syllables are those of "Jerusalem!" and a manly
                     form is seen the faint moonlight to make rapid strides across the road.</p>
                  <p>"Tch—tch—tch—he! he! he!" comes from one poplar tree inside the gate.</p>
                  <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7328-00000019"/>
                  <p>"Tch—tch—tch—te-he! te-he!" comes from behind another poplar tree inside the
                     gate.</p>
                  <p>Two plump female shapes come from behind two poplar trees inside the gate and
                     surround a third female shape, while a swift horseman clatters furiously past
                     the <emph>outside</emph> of the gate, and disappears.</p>
                  <p>O Miss Pye! Miss Margaret Pye! how <emph>are</emph> you now, my pretty dear?
                     "What's this? Where are you?" Why, this is the hand of your Cousin Minerva

                     subsequently spoke in terms of glowing eulogy concerning one whose sterling

               <p>AS we survey Old Age, my boy, through a piece of Smoked Glass, and observe its
                  impressive use of colored silk handkerchiefs; as we note how much respectability
                  it can express in a sonorous cough, and how much knowledge of our own inmost

                  indeed feel inspired with abject reverence for all that is past sixty, and refuse

                  to another in a friendship as deep and quiet as the long sleep in which they must
                  soon be still! By that intuitive sympathy which makes natural friends of<pb
                     n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7328-00000020"/> all men when they stand together upon the
                  verge of a land equally strange to all, the withered hand clasps strong the
                  withered hand on the borders of an unexplored Eternity.</p>
               <p>In a village, on the blue Connecticut, where young shad are salted and sold for
                  the best No. 1 Mackerel, and negro suffrage is considered an insidious device of
                  federal tyranny,—in this Arcadian hamlet, where innocence exists to a degree that
                  is oppressive to the senses,—I once knew two venerable men, whose friendship for
                  each other I have never seen equalled, save by that of Secretary Seward for the
                  Czar of Russia. For years they had peregrinated together in this vale of tears,
                  until they actually became as like as brothers, even in physical aspect. The nose
                  of one had the same caloric hue with the nose of the other. The breath of one
                  exhaled the aroma of a liquid of the tropical isles, only to exactly counterfeit
                  the West Indian fragrance labiated by the other. Even in the management of their
                  tumblers they were like a man and his glass; and one, who remembered having seen
                  them sober once (when they were children), said that they seemed much drawn
                  together whenever they got into the same wagon.</p>
               <p>At last one of them died suddenly of a distracted panorama of black monkeys, and
                  was placed in the village graveyard, under a stone bearing the simple Latin
                  inscription "Hie!"</p>
               <p>The survivor uttered no lamentations; his only words for a week were but
                  reiterations of the one syllable of his friend's epitaph; yet he shed tears to an
                  extent which(inasmuch as he never touched water) made his frequent falls the
                  evident result of "drop" -sy. One night, while returning in great mental anguish
                  from a protracted interview with the glass-clerk of the village hotel, he was
                  attacked with great violence by both sides of the road, and driven irregularly
                  into the wayside inclosure where rested his ancient friend. And upon that friend's
                  grave did he sadly stretch himself; nor was the touching pathos of the act
                  lessened by his simple-hearted belief that he was retiring to bed at home, nor by
                  his broken utterance of the word,—</p>
               <p>"Wairzerquilt?"</p>
               <p>At morn they found him there, roused him from his slumber, and rudely dragged him
                  before the 'squire.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with you?" asked the latter.</p>
               <p>The bereaved old man leaned heavily upon a constable for support, under his
                  emotion, and said solemnly,—</p>
               <p>"Isht'zfriendship."</p>
               <p>"And is it friendship, too which makes you speak in that thick way?" queried the
                  'squire.</p>
               <p>"Yeshir," murmured the aged mourner,—"Yeshir!"</p>
               <p>"I am afraid," added the magistrate, "that you are intoxicated."</p>
               <p>The venerable prisoner smiled seraphically; but, happening to remember himself, he
                  immediately frowned terribly. Then he smiled very violently again, and laid
                     himself<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7328-00000021"/> more comfortably upon the
                  constable. After which, he repeated his friend's epitaph several times—with
                  tears.</p>
               <p>"Noshir, said he,—"noshir!"</p>
               <p>"How, then, does it happen," went on the 'squire, "that you are found in your
                  present condition?"</p>
               <p>"Condizh'n?" ejaculated the venerable Damon, forming his lips suddenly into the
                  shape of a very tight rose, and swaying majestically—"Condizh'n? Did you know my
                  fren', shir? He was a drink'nman. Yeshir!—an' I caught it from siz-siz-szleepin'
                  on's grave!"</p>
               <p>I was reminded of this small and excellent Connecticut tale on Wednesday morning
                  last, when the Venerable Gammon laid bare his benignant heart to such inalienable
                  worshippers as had just invited him to take a brevet with them at the bar of
                  Willard's Hotel.</p>
               <p>"My children," said the aged benefactor of the universe, smiling mournfully at the
                  boiled slice of lemon which he was about to swallow from a goblet, "my children,
                  when I compare the Union of to-day with the Union formed by my old friend, George
                  Washington, I feel that the present is not the past, and that the abyss toward
                  which we are drifting is the chasm whither our footsteps tend. If to feel thus is
                  to be disloyal," said the Venerable Gammon, with much oily effulgence of
                  double-chin, "then was the male parent of his country disloyal; for I breathe but
                  the warning spirit of the great Sleeper at Mount Vernon." Whereupon everybody
                  admitted that Washington was, indeed, rather less ruinous than our present
                  sagacious Congress to everything national whatsoever; and it was proposed to
                  present an immediate service of plate to the friend of the <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >Pater patria.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>It is sweet and soothing to know, my boy, that those who, by virtue of
                  inexpressibly superior years, or recent political snubblings, are placed upon the
                  particular watchtowers of the country,—it is sweet and soothing, I say, to know,
                  that vigilant watchers like those, can detect coming Ruin at such a very long
                  distance; that we are allowed plenty of time to avert it if we choose—by letting
                  the ruin us beforehand.</p>
               <p>Thinking of this, I was upon the point of leaving the place, when a Republican
                  chap of much forehead called for another brevet, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"The Union of to-day has been turned into a howling wilderness of irredeemable
                  paper money by the presidential treachery of our former tailor. Men and brethren!"
                  exclaimed this earnest chap, wildly; "it is Andrew Johnson who has wrought this
                  inexpressible woe, which nothing but Impeachment can allay. To call him a
                  demagogue were flattery. What, then, shall we call this man of sin?"</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says a soft voice, "couldn't we call him a Sinagogue?"</p>
               <p>Turning quickly, to see what creature was capable of such an unseemly suggestion
                  at this solemn crisis in the history of our beloved country, I beheld Captain
                  Villiam Brown, who, having recently returned from a meeting of<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000022"/> the "Mackerel Army of the Republic," was on his way
                  to assure Congress that our late strategic national troops may be depended upon in
                  an emergency.</p>
               <p>"Hail to thee, my son of swords," said I, affably. "Does Mars call again to deeds
                  of high emprise; or come you hither only to be appointed Secretary of War <foreign

                     amongst the military believes in its illegality, until finally an
                     unbelieving THOMAS was found.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"Ad interim!" says Villiam, dreamily. "No, my fren'; the military being who is too
                  ready for an ad interim, only invites everybody to pitch interim; and when so many
                  beings are pitchers, it is only left for him to be a tumbler. Impeachment," says
                  Villiam, reasoningly, "is chiefly a matter of pitchers and tumblers—the former of
                  which contain so much small-beer, that they will be found foaming at the mouth at
                  the 'bar' of the Senate when the Sinagogue of the White House goes thither for his
                  bitters."</p>
               <p>Perceiving that Villiam's thirsty military mind mistook for a spirituous
                  dispensary the august "bar" of that higher branch of our national legislature
                  which has Ben Wade in the balance and is found wanting the Presidency, I led him
                  out for a walk on the Avenue; and was about explaining to him that said bar
                  offered nothing stronger than the occasional crusty port of Mr. Sumner, when we
                  were abruptly accosted by a hasty Western chap in a soft black hat, linen duster,
                  and gray worsted mittens.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me," says he, pantingly; "but I have just arrived form the loyal State of
                  Illinois to offer ten thousand muskets to Congress for its approaching single
                  combat with the criminal tailor of the White House, and wish to be directed to the
                  proper authorities."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, "are they needle-guns?"</p>
               <p>"Why should they be that kind?" says the chap, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"Because," says Villiam, thoughtfully, "the President, being a tailor by
                  profession, will naturally adopt the needle-gun for himself, in case of war. You
                  know," says Villiam, pleasantly, "when there are breeches between two parties, and
                  they come to be much wore, the 'needle' gun is likely to be most useful in
                  patching up a piece."</p>
               <p>The Western chap scowled, and says he, "I'm a gun-maker myself, and wish to sell
                  the guns I have mentioned without further confusion." And he left us in great
                  indignation.</p>
               <p>"Behold," says Villiam, gazing after him, and simultaneously eating a
                  clove—"behold, my fren', how the loyal heart of the country responds when a
                  patriotic Congress stands forth against the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ad
                     interim</foreign> of arbitrary tyranny. I really believe," says Villiam,
                  confidently, "that if it should come to violence we might have every old duck-gun
                  in the country—for cash."</p>
               <p>Deeply impressed by the profound remark, I left him;<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000023"/> and in two hours thereafter was standing within the
                  storied Senate-Chamber of the United States of America! I am not a bad man, my
                  boy; nor can I accuse myself of any greater detriment to self-respect than may
                  have been involved in the spending of several days in New Jersey without
                  compulsion; but when I beheld that High Court of Impeachment,—when I looked down
                  from the gallery upon that scene of much shirt-collar, tremendous forehead, and
                  frequent judicial stomach, I was immediately conscious of the same painful
                  insignificance I had felt once before in my life when surveying an Elephant. Upon
                  that earlier occasion. I strove to reason with myself against such humiliating
                  personal microscopicality. I said to myself, there in unquestionably a certain
                  aggravating LARGENESS about him, and if he wore proportionate spectacles and
                  watch-seal he'd look nearly as majestic as a German musician. But where's the
                  Mind—the giant human Mind!—to inform that vast tabernacle of flesh, and give those
                  broad temples and equivalent intelligence?</p>
               <p>It was of no use. I'd seen too many fat ones of my own kind, without minds, while
                  attending the New York Constitutional Convention. I continued to feel smaller and
                  smaller in that enormous presence, until it suddenly recurred to me that I had
                  paid twenty-five cents to see the Immensity! At the thought, all my natural
                  complacency came back in a flash! Yes, sir, I swelled immediately; and winked so
                  much to myself, that an aged maiden in the throng thought herself affectionately
                  addressed thereby by, and dedicated a "personal" to me in next day's "Herald."</p>
               <p>I shall not attempt to explain just why such a matter should affect me thus; but
                  as I surveyed the High Court of Impeachment, and experienced the very same ole
                  sensation of comparative nothingness, I felt that the trouble lay in my not having
                  paid twenty-five cents before entering. Going back, therefore, for a moment, I
                  fairly compelled a doorkeeper to restore my self-respect by accepting the proper
                  money, and was then in a condition to behold with some equanimity one of the most
                  immense scenes in the history of our distracted globe.</p>
               <p>A door opened; the Sergeant-at-arms advanced toward the Chair of the Senate,
                  announcing "A Committee from the House of Representatives," and was followed by
                  the Committee, headed by a very old man. The President of the Senate arose. It was
                  proclaimed that any one who uttered sound from the galleries should be imprisoned.
                  The Old Man—a very old man, and tottering; yet young and of granite, with the
                  yearless, inexorable purpose of a Fate—handed his whip<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_004" xml:id="return_004">*</ref>
                   to the Sergeant-at-arms, cast his hat upon a chair, and—paused. The
                  President of the Senate glanced slowly around at the pale, intent faces about and
                  above him; extended a hand aloft; and dropped a pin. The noise of the fall reached
                  every ear distinctly. Then the Old Man spoke,—</p>

               <p>"We, the Representatives of the Republic, in the name of the whole People of the
                  United States. do Impeach Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, for
                  certain High Crimes and Misdemeanors; and shall present, in substantiation
                  thereof, divers Articles, known by grammar as the Definite and the Indefinite. And
                  we do demand that the Senate take my order to call the said Andrew Johnson before
                  its bar."</p>
               <p>The President of the United State said: "The Senate will take that order;" and the
                  Old Man (whose name, as I am informed, is Thaddeus Stevens) led his Committee in
                  silence from the chamber.</p>
               <p>It had been a grand, momentous, dreadful scene; and only the first, too, in a
                  drama which were paralyzing to a nation not already schooled to tragedy in its
                  high places. Who can wonder that it has already—it and its kind—produced much
                  demoralization?</p>
               <p>For instance: an enterprising chap of much news-agency has just been detected in
                  fraud possible only in a time and date of a newspaper at will, this unscrupulous
                  chap has been distributing the very same copy of that excellent morning journal,
                  The New York "Tribune," day after day to his patrons, for several months; buying
                  it back for quarter-price each night, and dealing it out again to the same parties
                  next morning with altered date-line. Probably he might have gone on this for a
                  year without detection, but for the recent discovery of a joyous man who had just
                  forwarded a paid advertisement of the death of his mother-in-law, and had his
                  suspicions aroused by not finding it in print.</p>
               <p>A still sadder case is that of a thoughtful and venerable file who, being a
                  subscriber for the New York "Times," had drawn two parallel but distinct chalk
                  lines on the floor of his office, the one marked "Republican" and the other
                  "Democratic." It was the custom of this truly eccentric file to stand upon one or
                  the other of these lines when reading his favorite and admirable journal of a
                  morning, according as that journal changed sides in politics each twenty-four
                  hours; but it happened that when Impeachment became a fixed fact, the same
                  pleasing daily journal took both sides with great ability.</p>
               <p>The aged file tried thereupon to read with one foot on one line and the other on
                  the other. Alas! the stretch was too great for one of his years, and he speedily
                  became what is called "cracked." Then with the dread fires of insanity blazing in
                  his eyes, he flew to the White House, tore madly into the presence of the
                  President, fell upon his knees, and says, he,—</p>
               <p>"A boon! my liege, a boon!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Johnson laid aside a spoon, the metal of which he had been testing in a glass
                  retort containing some hot liquid preparation, and asked, "What can your lawful
                  suzerain do for you, good Lorenzo? But hold! let me ring for an ad interim, or a
                  brevet, to raise your spirits."</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7328-00000025"/>
               <p>"No, my suzerain, I am not thirsty," cried the aged maniac. "But I would have your
                  consent to wed an old lady in your employ, whom I love."</p>
               <p>"Her name—what is it?" cried his sovereign, hastily.</p>
               <p>"She is Secretary Welles, of the Navy," moaned the madman.</p>
               <p>"Here, guards!" called the great ruler; "away with this lunatic. I would be
                  alone."</p>
               <p>This, this, is indeed Impeachment.</p>
               <p>And now, my boy, as I close this letter, there comes news of the arrival of a
                  high-toned Democrat of much cheek-bones, from New York, who, finding the
                  carrying-in-coal profession rather dull just now, has sped hither to pledge ten
                  thousand men for the support of the President against a demoniac Congress. But I
                  smile softly to myself while I write, that no such needless aid will be accepted;
                  for Mr. Johnson is a man who, under no possible provocation, could be induced to
                  "take the 'Pledge.'"</p>

               <p>WHAT luxury of feeling there is in that earliest hour of recognized Spring, when
                  the door by which Winter has gone out can be left open for a while Winter has gone
                  out can be left open for a while without discomfort, and the casement, that
                  uncloses to release the lingering smoky ghost of the last fire upon the hearth,
                  lets in a sunny spirit whose only flames and sparks shall be roses and
                  humming-birds!</p>
               <p>In terms not unlike these did I express the sentiment of the season to Miss
                     Agonies<ref rend="super" target="#note_005" xml:id="return_005">*</ref>
                   Blatherly,—only filial expense of the Hon. Senator Blatherly, of Pequog,
                  as I escorted her some morning ago to select her new spring things for the
                  Impeachment. It was "Opening-day,"—that day of deep thought, and much milliner's
                  bill, when the subtle mind of woman devises its most touching appeals to the funds
                  of the thing called Man,—and while carriage rolled slowly along the Avenue I spoke
                  as I have written.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_005">

               <p>"Oh, spring is perfectly sweet," she responded, with thoughtful earnestness; "and
                  pa says that the spring-lamb will he heavenly this year; but some of the
                  mantilla-jackets they're wearing now are utterly horrid."</p>
               <p>"Still," said I, with great depth of feeling, "your sensitive woman's heart can
                  scarcely take its usual delight even in the most expensive organdy, when you
                  remember that the present spring is to witness the most solemn State Trial within
                  the memory of man."</p>
               <p>She met my penetrating gaze with a look of timid sympathy, and answered, with a
                  sigh,—</p>
               <p>"I shall wear a black French grenadine, with the back widths full and the front
                  gored."</p>
               <p>The remark indicated such an appreciative sense of the grave perils of the hour,
                  that I could only press softly the little hand nearest my own, and tell her that
                  her selection of black instead of gay colors, to wear to the Impeachment, would
                  teach the world that woman knows how to feel for the inexpressible woes of her
                  distracted country. I told her also, in trembling accents, that it would be a
                  rebuke to those who opposed female suffrage on the ground that her sex knew not
                  how to judge great national events; and besought her not to let her exquisite
                  sympathy with the suffering nation lead her into too plain a waist.</p>
               <p>An air of patient sadness and resignation characterized the whole aspect of the
                  grenadine maiden, and said she,—</p>
               <p>"Pearl-colored poplin with vandyke flounces, and tan-colored gloves, may do for
                  the gay when pleasure's throng is nigh; but at such a moment as this, I love my
                  afflicted native land too well to wear anything but jet bead trimmings and a Marie
                  Antoinette scarf."</p>
               <p>Think of this, my boy, in your own home, when some thoughtful, loving face bends
                  over your shoulder, and a low, sweet voice asks to be taken to the Impeachment.
                  Think of it when, in a moment of brutal irritation, you would speak sharply to the
                  gentle creature who wishes to lay down her organdy and poplin for her country—and
                  is none the less earnest in such self-sacrifice because she thinks that
                  Impeachment must be something like the opera.</p>
               <p>While Impeachment is being prepared for the stage, I pass much of my time in
                  fashionable grenadine society, studying the fair young women of the Republic in
                  all their beautiful intellectual phases; and as no one of them has thus far
                  encouraged me to write her alone, I do now beg leave, with the utmost courtesy, to
                  address them all.</p>
               <p>You need not be informed, young ladies, that a majority of those excellent and
                  rather mature persons hitherto favoring you with counsel and criticism in print
                  have adopted a didactic and grievous strain, somewhat suggestive of those terrors
                  to the young known as spectacles. There is at all times about a pair of spectacles
                  a certain oppressive glare of severe human knowledge,—not to say patriarchal
                  malevolence,—which continually forces upon observing youth a sense of infantile
                  shortcomings, and a vague consciousness of unparalleled crime. The concentrated
                  glare of the spectacles of six clergymen with blue umbrellas, at a<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000027"/> fashionable revival meeting, has been known to make
                  a fair girl of thirty utterly embittered against herself and her frivolous younger
                  sister for two weeks; and it is upon record that a lovely seminary scholar, who
                  had received a note from a young man of limited salary, was induced, by the
                  spectacles of a maiden aunt, to confess herself guilty of murder.</p>
               <p>The kind of literature suggesting spectacles is apt to have a like crushing and
                  enfeebling effect,—causing the young partaker either to experience a morose
                  realization of the general inability of youth to surpass palpable idiocy in
                  anything; or to indulge in those untimely slumbers which notoriously indicate of
                  the celebrated Human Family. It may, indeed, be truthfully said, that the
                  relentless reiterative references to that same domestic circle, in this kind of
                  literature, have had a tendency to gift the minds of the incorrigibly immature
                  with an impression of a "Family" wearing spectacles of the most vindictive
                  manufacture, and continually glaring righteous indignation at an innumerable host
                  of youthful conspirators against its most sacred rights.</p>
               <p>Let it be my object then, young ladies, to counsel, you, kindly and courteously,
                  through the medium of a style betraying what may be delicately mentioned as the
                  disrobed eye,—basing my supposition of your needs upon comprehensive aspect to the
                  undraped optic; and tendering advice at no time savoring more of artificial vision
                  than may possibly be involved in an occasional hint of the two little orphan
                  goggles casually bestriding the nose of innocent and harmless manhood.</p>
               <p>Long and thoughtful contemplation of your delightful sex through a piece of Smoked
                  Glass—which I use to protect my eyes from over-dazzling—has impressed me with a
                  firm belief in the unquestionable superiority of all young ladies to their
                  parents; and I would especially bring to your attention the manifest propriety of
                  discountenancing any familiarity from your mothers when in society. If obliged to
                  go with your tiresome maternals to any social gathering, you may reclaim your
                  freedom immediately upon entering the room by slipping abstractedly away in the
                  direction of the piano, and from thenceforth being artlessly forgetful of all
                  messages forwarded to you, and miraculously blind to all beckonings and elevations
                  of fans. Sentimental dry-goods clerks have, before now, been greatly stricken at
                  heart by such evidences of refined feminine spirit; and distinguished foreigners
                  have more than once been tempted into offering their hands and hearts, by
                  well-timed exhibitions of filial contempt,—quite forgetful, in the enthralling
                  excitement of the moment, of the wives they already had in their own
                  countries.</p>
               <p>In fact, this question of the management of would-be familiar mothers is of vital
                  importance to the dignity of your whole young ladyhood, and should have a large
                  part of its treatment at home, where forward mothers are only too apt to presume
                  upon accidental amiability. Guarding<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7328-00000028"/>
                  yourselves vigorously against the vulgarizing entertainment of any old-fashioned
                  idea humdrum "duty," as the bores call it, let it be your business to watch
                  jealously for the first approach to undue freedom on the part of the vain old
                  ladies, and then give them immediately to understand that you are not children
                  now, ma, if you please. This wholesome reminder, administered with a proper sweep
                  of the skirts and pensive illustrations of firmness of character. Well-disciplined
                  mothers will seldom venture to express unasked opinions regarding the colors and
                  styles of dresses patronized by their daughters; but in cases where some momentary
                  indulgence has deluded them into this greater liberty, there is nothing like a
                  well-slammed door, or an immediate practice of the scales at the piano.
                  Well-slammed doors and those eternal scales are the tremendous instruments of
                  rebuke and torture with which your sex can at any time make life a burden to a
                  whole flock of enemies.</p>
               <p>In the subjection of your fathers to their proper condition of helpless neutrality
                  and financial liberality, you must exercise more gradual measures; for a certain
                  low kind of conceited importance clings to a man as long as he lives, and often
                  incites him to desperate efforts for the enslavement of his natural owners—his
                  children," if these necessary afflictions have the habit of smoking. You will then
                  have a perfectly just excuse for seeing as little of them as possible, and
                  gradually breaking their spirits and humbling them in their own estimations, by
                  casually throwing out hints at the breakfast-table about being almost choked
                  whenever you go near pa's room. Pa thus has impressed upon him a sense of his own
                  degradation, and will feel himself but poorly compensating for the great trial he
                  is to you, by abjectly and promptly responding to all demands upon his purse. He
                  will also hand your fan and shawl to you after the ball, when promising young man
                  is to be emphatically recalled to a sense of his continued insignificance. In
                  fact, a well-behaved father is useful in many ways, when trained with a firm hand,
                  and the skill employed in teaching him his tricks is never wasted.</p>
               <p>In regard to the piano which you all indubitably owe to society, young ladies, I
                  would unhesitatingly counsel systematic violence in the whole Italian department,
                  and a principled unconsciousness of the existence of any genteel compositions in
                  English. That is to say, you should thus exhibit your piano in society; though at
                  home it will be good policy to select some one national air as a means of
                  embittering the souls of your parents against music forever, and thus ridding
                  yourselves of those importunings for specimens of your skill with which only
                  perfect strangers have any right to assail you. A really great effect can be
                  achieved in company by miss-keying a little when you first take seat at the
                  instrument, and then looking artlessly up at the most eligible set of whiskers
                  present, as who should<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7328-00000029"/> say: Oh dear! what
                  a frightful creature I am! Promptly follow this by an impatient
                  straightening-up,—an archly affectionate glance, as for playful help, toward some
                  other young lady whom you have met that evening for the first time,—and an instant
                  plunge of all your fingers into the most deafening of the notes; and you will make
                  the eligible whiskers ruin himself with bouquets for you in less than a month.</p>
               <p>Additionally to the piano, you also owe to society a strict abstinence from
                  anything approximating to Nature; which, as all well-bred people know, is
                  something vulgarly cheap and only patronized by the lower classes. You must select
                  models for yourselves from those practitioners of the graces in your own sex whose
                  fashionable campaigns have made them your superiors in art, and whom you will
                  speedily know by the intense envy and hatred you will feel toward them from the
                  first. The envy and hatred in question will not be what common people call by
                  those names at all; they will really be the refined mental components of a high
                  order of intellectual energy, developing in you a genius for imitation conserving
                  the loftiest art.</p>
               <p>To make perfect your Artificiality, however,—to make it irresistibly eloquent of
                  womanhood's most exquisite sensibilities,—you must manage to subdue it here and
                  there with little touches of girlish prettiness. Thus, when conversing in society,
                  or even in the conservatory at home, with some eligible son of a rich Contractor,
                  you can appear sweetly thoughtful and girlishly innocent by a judicious bit of
                  by-play with your lace pocket-handkerchief. Supposing you to have prepared
                  yourself before hand with a handkerchief carelessly thrown over your shoulders,
                  you talk yourself apparently into a gentle sort of dreamy abstraction; and then,
                  with your eyes softly fixed on vacancy, though still talking, you unconsciously as
                  it were carry one end of your handkerchief to the mouth with the forefinger of
                  your right hand, keep pushing it thus, inch by inch, through your lips as you
                  stand, until the other end falls from your shoulders and the whole handkerchief
                  drops to the floor. This rouses you from your pretty reverie with a start, and (if
                  possible of production) a blush; you make a half-motion to pick it up; the
                  eligible captive is too quick for you, however, and succeeds in lifting the prize
                  just as the most enthralling of little slippers is darted out to save it. Don't
                  you see the inimitable hit thus made? Don't you see of a Contractor to insist upon
                  keeping the handkerchief, and thus hopelessly commit himself?</p>
               <p>These little touches of girlish prettiness are indeed of the utmost importance to
                  you, young ladies, and always convince the sensible masculine observer that you
                  have those tender and confiding qualities of heart which would enable loving
                  husbands to lead you by a thread.</p>
               <p>I would even specialize one more of these touches, lest you in your uncalculating
                  guilelessness should forget it. I would have you bear in mind the really beautiful
                     device<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7328-00000030"/> of having particular female
                  friends of your own age; and rather plainer than yourselves, whose waists you can
                  frequently embrace in public, and whom you can habitually salute as "darling
                  love," "my precious," "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">cheri</foreign>" or "my darling
                  dear," when gentlemen are present. No eligible single gentleman was ever known to
                  be proof against this Arcadian little—<emph>will</emph> you excuse me?—dodge. It
                  is not <emph>in</emph> a single gentleman to means to make head against such an
                  artless evidence of your inexpressible capacity for loving.</p>
               <p>In the matter of conversation, society expects you to express ignorance of every
                  material thing in the world as grammatically as possible. It also expects you to
                  practise the phrase, "How Perfectly Ridiculous," until you can use it as a reply
                  and comment to and upon everything not supposed to be of daily occurrence in high
                  life. As,—</p>
               <p>"Did you hear, Miss Gusherby, that your father's old partner had committed
                  suicide?"</p>
               <p>"How Perfectly Ridiculous!"</p>
               <p>"O Morianna Gusherby! I shall never get over it—I'm sure I shan't. I saw a man run
                  over in front of Stewart's to-day, and the-wheels went right over his face!"</p>
               <p>"How Perfectly Ridiculous!"</p>
               <p>Politics, of course, are too horrid to be talked about at all, save in that
                  general easy and graceful superciliousness of tone toward anything original with
                  your own country which infallibly indicates aristocratic elevation of sentiment
                  ment. Quite a reputation for intellect, too, may possibly be gained by a rather
                  scornful mention of Mr. Greeley as <foreign xml:lang="FRA">un ami des
                     noirs.</foreign> This is supposing, of course, that you have studied French
                  sufficiently to know where to find convenient phrases in the back of Worcester's
                  larger Dictionary.</p>
               <p>Possibly you will accuse me, young ladies, of counselling you as though you were
                  all expected to act precisely alike—were all to be exact repetitions, or
                  reflections, of each other; but such implied and intolerable sarcasm is by no
                  means characteristic of my courteous intent. In my large experience of the world
                  and perfect familiarity with the most estimable qualities of your sex, I have seen
                  the most brilliant effects produced, by some of you, upon plans quite distinct
                  from those occupying so much of this letter.</p>
               <p>For instance: I have known some of you to bless society with a real Sensation, by
                  continually maintaining a Thoughtful and Sceptical aspect,—as though enduring the
                  contact of the gay, giddy world only upon sufferance, and perpetually filled with
                  a sadly-sweet longing for the spiritual companionship of barely one Real Friend.
                  Your demeanor has conveyed an idea of the most touching, patient suffering, and
                  you have allowed it to be whispered about that your life-long affliction is a want
                  of True Sympathy,—an eternal yearning for Some One who can Truly Understand you.
                  It is recorded, in some musty tradition or other, that this tone of bearing in the
                  fashionable female<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7328-00000031"/> young, was attributed
                  by our rude ancestors to Dyspepsia,—a barbarous disease anciently produced by t a
                  too ardent addiction to boarding-school candies, vinegar, and slate-pencils. Now,
                  however, all genteel persons know it to be an indication of a finely strung
                  nature, and the young man who <emph>can</emph> Truly Understand does not struggle
                  long against his fate.</p>
               <p>To succeed in this plan, however, requires a force of character of which many fine
                  feminine organisms are not at all times capable. Being aware of this fact, it
                  affords me the greater pleasure to set, with all humility, before you, another and
                  no less effective means of indicating distinctive traits to the world. It is
                  possible for you to show a decided individually by the Dressing of your Hair; and,
                  perhaps, I cannot more clearly illustrate to you the wonderful use of
                  Hair-dressing alone to epitomize all that there is of distinguishing character in
                  your gracious sex, than by submitting to your indulgent attention an authenticated

                  mind thereby to write such an article on the Present State of the Universe as
                  shall at once fill out a column, and spare his subscribers the shock of being
                  tempted to read the "editorial page" for once in their lives; so do I look abroad,
                  my boy, from the window of my room at Willard's upon this entire humorous nation
                  of ours, and am so enfeebled in intellect by the spectacle of its unspeakable
                  equanimity under Reconstruction and Impeachment, that orders for thoughtful
                  newspaper-article upon the Progress of Democratic Principles in Russia may be
                  forwarded at once to my address. As I look thus extensively abroad—after
                  incidentally nodding in a chaste and pleasing manner to a grenadine maiden at
                  another casement—I cannot help observing to myself, "This is, indeed,
                     equanimity,"<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7328-00000034"/> and reminds me of what
                  once occurred in the Sixth Ward.</p>
               <p>In that cradle of American liberty in which many a one has been "rocked" by
                  political persons of Irish descent, there formerly resided a middle-aged top, of
                  dumpling forehead and continual fatness of smile, who went beaming around
                  everywhere like a private sun with spectacles on, and passed through two panics,
                  and a cholera season, with so much equanimity that his friends concluded he must
                  be either a statue of George Washington or a great philosopher. Did a vast fire
                  break out in his district, an election go this way or that way, or a riot destroy
                  all his neighbors' windown,—this fine old top would be out next morning in a
                  perfect sunrise of contented smile, covering everybody all over with a placidity,
                  and being taken by strangers for both Benjamin Franklin and Mr. Greeley. Did half
                  his family try to put him out of the house, or his two only sons half kill each
                  other in a domestic fight,—this calm old top would keep shining on harder than
                  ever, and plastering up his head and going to his daily business with such bright
                  looks that many mistook him for an unmarried man. Persons from other wards would
                  go to him and expostulate against so much equanimity,—telling him that it injured
                  the value of their property and produced sickness in their minds; but he only
                  shook hands with them all round in an extremely affectionate manner, and went
                  beaming away to attend the funeral of his brother.</p>
               <p>At last, however, a crowning calamity seemed to threaten this radiant top, and all
                  his wife's relatives hoped that his time had come. In a high-moral life insurance
                  company, of which he was an immense stockholder, a great dispute took place
                  between the President and the Board of Directors. The former, between two meetings
                  of the Board, took the responsibility of getting out a new style of "Policy," by
                  which the person who insured under it was obliged to assert no more than that he
                  had a sound Constitution. The Secretary of the Company, who had been made such
                  under a former President, opposed this style of Policy with all his might;
                  whereupon, the President suspended him from office, put in a Secretary <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">ad interim,</foreign> removed such agents of the Company in
                  other cities as refused to adopt the new Policy, and commenced doing such a
                  wholesale Constitutional business that all creation bade fair to be insured in a
                  month. Then came the Meeting of the Directors, a majority of whom were
                  patent-medicine men, and who, in the original Policy, had specified not only that
                  the insured should have sound Constitutions, but that said soundness should have
                  been specially produced by the use (affirmed under oath) of their
                  patent-medicines. The Directors reinstated the original Secretary and Policy; the
                  defiant President was arraigned before the Board with a view to his supersedure by
                  the Vice-President; and, in the ensuing public scandal, the whole business of the
                  Company stood still.<ref rend="super" target="#note_006" xml:id="return_006"

               <p>Then all the wife's relatives of the middle-aged and philosophical top believed
                  that they had him at last, and repaired in a body to his private residence to
                  witness the overwhelming defeat of his equanimity; but to their unspeakable
                  disgust they found him perusing, in great comfort, the latest news of the trouble
                  in a stentorian daily journal, the while his features shone with that debilitating
                  serenity which eternally characterizes the photographs we have taken for our
                  unmarried female friends.</p>
               <p>"Old man!" cried the relatives, rending their garments, and feeling sorry for it
                  immediately after; "do you realize that this quarrel will ruin you, by making your
                  stock in the Company worthless? How, oh how! under this last awful go, can you
                  exhibit so much equanimity?"</p>
               <p>"My friends," said this vivacious top, with a pleased expression, "why should I
                  shed the briny? Under the Director's 'Policy' there would never be any business at
                  all, which would be ruin. Under the President's 'Policy' the business would be
                  wholesale recklessness, which would be ruin; and in the fight between the two
                  Policies there is ruin any way. Give my love to your families, and send in the
                  Sheriff."</p>
               <p>After which the imperturbable top went cheerfully humming to put on his gaiters;
                  and tripped away, with the utmost satisfaction, to register his name under the
                  Bankrupt Act.</p>
               <p>I have been thinking, my boy, I have been thinking, that perhaps the curious
                  medical treatment of having its lower limbs kept in hot water for years,
                  accompanied by the amazing surgical operation of having its head slowly sawed off,
                  may not be the surest means of restoring health to the nation; and that the
                  inexpressible equanimity of the latter under Reconstruction and Impeachment may
                  possibly be based upon a philosophy like that which I have celebrated.</p>
               <p>Discussing this and other great questions, I was walking down Pennsylvania Avenue
                  with a solid Boston man yesterday, when we ran against a fellow-being who, with
                  his back toward us, was attentively contemplating our national banner as it
                  floated over a building near by. With arms folded, head thrown back, and the
                  south-east corner of the Ten-of-Clubs accidentally protruding below the lining of
                  his soft black hat, he reminded me somewhat of Hamlet, just prior to his little
                  affair with Laertes; but, upon looking more closely, I recognized the Conservative
                  Kentucky Chap.</p>
               <p>"Well met, my 'Knight of the Golden Circle!'" cried I, introducing my friend;
                  "what cheer?"</p>
               <p>"Hem!" says the Kentucky Chap, "the National Democratic Organization, of which
                  Kentucky is the pride, knows nothing whatsoever about any golden circle except the
                  'Whiskey Ring.'"</p>
               <p>Here the Conservative Kentucky Chap gazed again at the floating standard, and says
                  he,—</p>
               <p>"When I look upon that picture of Kentucky's starry sky, and remember than ten
                  stars in the constellation are still kept in eclipse by the negro-suffrage
                  despotism of New England, I feel as though the ten of diamonds had<pb n="70-71"

               <p>Here the solid Boston man breathed very hard, as though he had just arisen from
                  his usual morning prayer to Dickens, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Did you speak to me, Rebel?"</p>
               <p>The Kentucky Chap scowled such an intense frown of assent that the four of clubs
                  worked down out of his hat to the brow of his left eye, and gave him the
                  appearance of being under treatment for ophthalmia.</p>
               <p>"That flag is for every American freeman!" says the solid Boston man, "and is
                  favorably mentioned in the works of Dr. Holmes as such. Next to the Hoosac Tunnel
                  and Ticknor &amp; Fields' new bookshop, it is dearer to every loyal bosom, whether
                  white or black, than all else in the wide world. And shall its stars shine for the
                  white Rebel while the sable loyalist is forgotten? Forbid it, Bunker Hill! I tell
                  you," exclaimed the solid Boston man, growing purple in the face, "that
                  Massachusetts has at length decided to raise the free-negro race to their
                  birthright under the national stars, even though it should be necessary to trust
                  that flag entirely to black guards!"</p>
               <p>He meant it honestly, my boy; he almost cried under his keen sense of the
                  magnanimous intention of Massachusetts; but upon catching the intensely cocked eye
                  of the Conservative Kentucky Chap, I coughed in a manner quite unfamiliar to our
                  highest-priced physicians; and slapped Kentucky's favorite son so severely upon
                  the black, to save him from inexplicable choking, that a small black case-bottle
                  and three court-cards shot out of his forward vestments like meteors from a
                  cloud.</p>
               <p>Fain would this friendly pen pursue the theme, were it not for a card inscribed as
                  follows,—</p>

               <p>This ticket lies here upon my desk; and below it is a smaller one, answering to
                  the between-acts "check" of other theatres, and intended for use at the door when
                  you desire to leave for a few moments. It is inscribed, simply, <q>
                     <p>TICKET OF LEAVE.</p>
                  </q> and admits the bearer to the theatre again, after he shall have procured the
                  glass of water and eaten the clove, to lunch upon which he went out.</p>
               <p>Promptly, at one o'clock, on two days of this week, I used the first of the above
                  tickets, and had the pleasure of escorting a fashionable maiden, of imperceptible
                  bonnet, to one of the best seats in the house. Let this agile pen<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000037"/> move slowly, my boy; and this ink, which is of the
                  color of the freed-negro race, flow gently, while I recall the scene that burst
                  upon my vision and must have broken many pairs of spectacles. After seating the
                  maiden, and giving her half an hour to complete that pulling of skirts with which
                  the bell-shaped women of America are wont to soothe the nerves of all beholders at
                  church and the opera, I pulled out my piece of Smoked Glass, and began my survey
                  of a national pageant which were over-dazzling to eyes not thus protected. Two
                  injuriously lustrous planets at once saluted my startled gaze, fixed in line, on
                  an apparent firmament of deep blue; but before I could express the opinion that I
                  must be going mad, or that something seriously astronomical must be the matter
                  with my orbs, the shining twain resolved themselves into two gorgeous brass
                  buttons upon the cerulean dress-coat of a military being who had affably taken a
                  standing position right in front of my Smoked Glass.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, sir," said I, with bitter sarcasm; "but, as you have not a pane in
                  your stomach, I cannot see through you."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said a familiar voice, "if I'd thought of that, my fren', I'd have worn my
                  sash."</p>
               <p>Directing my Smoked Glass to his face, which was now turned toward me, I
                  recognized Captain Villiam Brown; who, with his own bit of glass, had been
                  engagingly observing the innumerable organdy and grenadine maidens in the
                  dress-circle.</p>
               <p>"Ha, my Lord Cardigan," said I, after excusing myself to the lady in my own care,
                  and moving away with the Mackerel hero, "do you come here to study the Black Crook
                  which out national affairs seem to have taken, or are you present rather as an
                  indifferent spectator of the White Forney?"<ref rend="super" target="#note_008"

               <p>"My fren'," says Villiam, taking a handful of peanuts from one of his pockets and
                  giving me half, "I come to the High Court of Impeachment to examine the fashions,
                  and see whether bonnets have got low enough yet to make it safe to enter into the
                  5-20 bonds of wedlock."</p>
               <p>"I don't know about the bonnets," said I, calmly; "for my Smoked Glass does not
                  magnify enough to reveal them to me. But this season's dresses are certainly low
                  enough—in the neck."</p>
               <p>"Ah! says Villiam, severely; "the dresses of some of these fair beings are so low,
                  that they are virtually a take-off of everything our mothers used to wear. Hum!"
                  says Villiam, anxiously, "some of them will take cold in this changeable weather
                  if they don't put on more fans."</p>
               <p>Thus speaking, he left me, and I hastened to the grenadine of my choice, carrying
                  thither one of the programmes, reading thus,—</p>

               <p>As I looked down from the dress-circle into the pit during the opening scenes, and
                  brought my bit of Smoked Glass to bear upon one after another of the great actors,
                  there came upon me an unseemly disposition to mislead the intellect of the
                  innocent being at my side, and encourage her to believe that the scene then "on"
                  was intended to represent a fashionable dining-saloon.</p>
               <p>"Why," she whispered, "does that fine-looking creature, at the top table, rap
                  so?"</p>
               <p>It was the Chief Justice rapping for order, but I told her that he was knocking
                  for a waiter to come and take his order.</p>
               <p>Was this wrong, my boy? Did I thereby cast ridicule upon the majestic judicial
                  proceedings of the United States of America, and fill the subtle mind of woman
                  with mistaken imaginings? Perhaps so, my Pythias; perhaps so; but she thought that
                  first scene was laid in an eating-house, and kept wondering why the tables of the
                  Counsel and Managers were not furnished at least with some representative of
                  Ham.</p>
               <p>Speaking of the latter, I was conversing last evening with the former chaplain of
                  the Mackerel Brigade, concerning the President's line of defence; and suggested to
                  him, that, inasmuch as Mr. Johnson is a tailor by profession, and therefore,
                  according to popular belief, only one-ninth of a man, it was palpably unfair for
                  the Senate to be his jury.</p>
               <p>"How so?" asked the chaplain.</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7328-00000039"/>
               <p>"Why," said I; "can there be any fairness in pitting a one-ninth-er against so
                  many Se'n-a-tors?"</p>
               <p>"Young man," quoth the Mackerel Chaplain, abstractedly; "the judgment of Heaven
                  has fallen upon the President because of his recreancy to the hapless children of
                  Heaven has fallen upon the President because of his recrency to the hapless
                  children of Ham, whose Moses he had promised to be. A black hand stretched to
                  Deity in a prayer for merited retribution may be stronger than the white hand that
                  invokes a blessing undeserved."</p>
               <p>How true that is, my boy, especially when you remember of what little account has
                  been that blessing once invoked for yourself by the hand of your father! A.
                  Johnson is doomed. Off with his head! So much for bucking Ham!</p>

               </opener>
               <p>EVEN as the blue-and-brassy bee, with one knowing eye fixed all the time upon some
                  goodly cabbage-rose, dallies with meaner flowers by way of adding relish to the
                  sweet delayed, so do I aggravate my self with baser themes only to make the
                  grander, when it comes, the full majesty of Impeachment. Be it known to you at
                  last, however, that on the occasion of my second visit, with the Mackerel
                  Chaplain, to the theatre where this successful piece is now running, we found at
                  the entrance there of one of the most loyal Southerners that ever refrained from
                  taking up arms against the Union on account of sickness. His name is Loyola
                  Munchausen, brother of Captain Munchausen, late of the well-known Southern
                  Confederacy; and as I gazed upon his spring-overcoat neatly manufactured from four
                  Confederate buttons and a bed-tick, his dress-hat composed of half a boot-leg,
                  mounted on one of those rims of tin through which stove-pipes enter chimneys; his
                  Parisian stock representing a spare strap with buckle form an old<pb n="78-79"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000040"/> trunk, and his April waistcoat worked up from a
                  remnant of once valuable stair-crpet,—I could not help murmuring sadly to myself,
                  "He does not look as wealthy as he did."</p>
               <p>At the moment of our meeting, this reduced but impressive Southern being was
                  fumbling in the eastern pocket of a pair of nether-garments, which seemed to have
                  been hastily made from thence the clam-shell which served him as a pocket-book. To
                  spare his feelings, I dropped my glance to his feet, which were plainly encased in
                  a pair of stirrups; but was not quick enough to avoid discovering that the sole
                  contents of his treasury were a shoe-string, a burnt match, and a cancelled
                  postage-stamp. Noticing my look, he loftily donned a pair of white cotton socks,
                  in place of gloves, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"What would you, Vandal?</p>
               <p>Grasping his left hand, and nearly wringing the sock off, I saluted him as the
                  brother of the very mirror of chivalry, and reminded him that I had been a
                  war-correspondent of an excellent Union journal while Captain Munchausen was a
                  Confederacy.</p>
               <p>"War-correspondent," says he, twirling the curtain-rod which he carried as a cane,
                  "war-correspondent?" He smiled darkly; and says he, "In that case, the sunny South
                  forgives your; for you must have been a real misfortune to her foes. I was about
                  to purchase a ticker here, but find that I must have left that hundred-dollar bill
                  in my other coat-pocket."</p>
               <p>"Come in with us," said I, gravely, "for we have sea-son-tickets for two; and, as
                  the audience is almost wholly feminine, we should be at least three-strong to
                  divide its staring and bad manners."</p>
               <p>"The ladies, sir," observed Loyola Munchausen, Kissing his right sock, "may stare
                  at me in a manner which I would not tolerate in a man; for a a true Southern
                  gentleman, I adore the sex; but, sir, if one solitary Yankee Vandal presumes to
                  fix upon me the gaze of a conqueror, there will be—ha! ha!—there will be another
                  war."</p>
               <p>After which he tucked the curtain-rod under one arm in a stylish and Malacca
                  manner, settled the boot-leg and tin rim more firmly upon his brow, and
                  accompanied us into the gallery, like one who had gone through a financial panic
                  without detraction from his largest-sized demeanor.</p>
               <p>Shall I confide unto you, my boy, how I lent the wealthy Southern my piece of
                  Smoked Glass, through which to observe, without detriment to his sight, the most
                  brilliant scene in our distracted national history; and pointed out to him all the
                  great men I could think of, without troubling myself much as to whether they
                  really were those great men or not? Shall I confide to you that I gave all the
                  principal female names in history to as many spring-bonnets as I could see? Let me
                  do nothing of the kind; for is not such conduct the exclusive privilege<pb

                  correspondents of all our reliable morning journals?</p>
               <p>But what is this procession that mine eyes behold, entering upon the stage? THE
                  SERGEANT-AT-ARMS, proclaiming that Impeachment is now about to begin. Followed by
                  THE CHIEF JUSTICE, asking himself the great question, "Am I am I, or am I not am
                  I?"</p>
               <p>After whom came A BLACKSMITH, to "rivet the attention of the audience;" A

                  words;" A GARDENER, to attend such as may be "withered by his invective;" MAN WITH
                  HOSE, to extinguish parties "fired by his eloquence."</p>

               <p>This procession having come fully into view, Thaddeus Butler stepped forth to
                  deliver the prologue of the piece, which he gave in the form of an ARGUMENT.</p>
               <p>"MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE MEN SENATE:—The onerous duty has fallen to my
                  fortune to present to you, imperfectly as I must, the several absences of fact and
                  law by virtue of which the House of Representatives will endeavor to sustain the
                  cause of the people against the President of the United States, not pending at
                  your bar. The difficulty of defining said 'people,' the unprecedented novelty of
                  said 'cause,' the perfect gravity with which we are trying to do it all, and the
                  evident propriety of holding out some idea that the questions to be submitted to
                  you adjudication have just occurred to us,—each and all must be my excuse for
                  giving you as much speech as human patience can endure.</p>
               <p>"Now, for the first time in the history of the world, has a nation brought its
                  Chief Magistrate to grief, by high legal process, for administering the powers and
                  duties of his high office in a manner somewhat disagreeable to the feelings of
                  those who expressly desired him to do otherwise. In other times and lands it has
                  been found that<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7328-00000042"/> despotism of this kind
                  could never be brought to trial in the courts, save upon rejoinder of the
                  defendant to recover costs and damages for frivolous prosecution, and, in the
                  absence of assassination, constitutional nations were obliged to endure rulers who
                  had been pronounced mad or imbecile by many whom those rulers had blindly
                  neglected to appoint to high and remunerative office. Only recently, one of the
                  most civilized countries in the world, and the one which we imitate and abuse the
                  most, was obliged to submit for years to the rule of a king currently believed to
                  be insane by every great man whom he had ever failed to make a prime-minister; and
                  all this because nobody could hit upon any particular reason for his removal.</p>
               <p>"Our fathers were wiser in founding our government, and provided,
                  constitutionally, that a President 'shall' be removed, on conviction of 'treason,
                  bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.' The provision is exact and
                  comprehensive in every particular, save one. It covers the whole ground of
                  Impeachment, save the specification of just what a disagreeable man can be
                  impeached for. This was wisely done, because human foresight must have been
                  inadequate, and the most ingenious human intelligence must have failed in the task
                  of anticipating anything like the fine point to which modern intellect has brought
                  the art of impeaching.</p>
               <p>"It may not be unamusing to remember, that the framers of our Constitution had
                  their minds improved, and their pride of human calculation humbled, while at their
                  noble work, by an exemplary case. In the previous year, only, Thaddeus Burke, from
                  his place in the House of Commons of England, had impeached Thaddeus Hastings for
                  the misdemeanor of governing India in such a manner as to absolutely render
                  soldiers and politicians unnecessary there. The mails were continually bringing
                  the gorgeous and burning speeches of the impeachers across the Atlantic; and the
                  great stress laid in these upon the above facts, and upon the additional
                  unheard-of enormity of Hastings not having made a fortune by his government, so
                  worked upon the intellects of our fathers, that they at once gave up all earthly
                  hope of anticipating what a man might be impeached for next, and left the document
                  open for modern improvements.</p>
               <p>"Now, therefore, we have the question; what are modern impeachable offences? To
                  quote from the learned judiciary labors of my able friend, the Honorable Thaddeus
                  Lawrence, of Ohio, we define an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor to be
                     <emph>an act committed or omitted in violation of the Constitution, or in
                     obedience thereto; and this may exist without violation of any positive law or
                     essential principle of government, yet be esteemed otherwise by those who, from
                     any motive or purpose, desire to impeach.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"The first criticism which will strike the mind on a thoughtful examination of
                  this definition is, that some of the despotic outrages enumerated in it are not
                  within the common-sense definition of Crimes. You will find, however<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000043"/> ever, upon turning to certain notes on the
                  commentaries of Thaddeus Blackstone, that '<emph>when the words "high crimes and
                     misdemeanors" are used in Impeachment, such words have no real meaning
                     whatever, but are used merely to give unspeakable solemnity to the
                     charge.</emph>' It being settled, therefore, that Impeachment may ensue from an
                  act either committed or omitted, and that the terms of the accusation have really
                  no earthly meaning, we next proceed to consider whether there actually exists any
                  tribunal to try the case.</p>
               <p>"The important question is, 'Does this Senate now sit as a Court, a Jury, or a
                  Coroner's Inquest?' The Constitution seems to have determined it to be the latter,
                  because, under its provision, a man must be politically deceased before he can get
                  any justice from it. You cannot be a Court, because there is no sign of law about
                  any of your proceedings. You cannot be a Jury, because you cannot be challenged,
                  and have made up your minds before hearing word of the case. You consult no laws
                  except the laws of health, and hold an Inquest by those rules only which refer to
                  Parliamentary 'bodies.' You are a law unto yourselves and to no one else.</p>
               <p>"In the first eight Articles of our charge the respondent is accused of removing
                  Secretary Stanton, and appointing Mr. Thomas Secretary <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ad
                     interim</foreign> when the latter was really of an opposite political party
                  from ours; which brings before the American Senate and people this plain issue:
                  Has the President, under the Constitution, the more than kingly prerogative to
                  remove executive officers of his own appointment, and replace them by others who
                  are not of our appointment? If the respondent can prove the affirmative, why then
                  the great question arises, whatever the Presidential office itself (if it has any
                  rights whatever) ought, in fact, to exist as a part of the Constitutional
                  government of a free people? If not, the respondent has no business to be
                  President at all; and whoever votes 'not guilty' on our Articles, votes to subject
                  our free institutions for four years to the presidency of any man who, being
                  elected President, may choose to officiate as such.</p>
               <p>"Article ninth charges that Major-General Thaddeus Emory being in command of the
                  Military Department of Washington, respondent did feloniously express to him the
                  belief that the Act of March 2, 1867, which provides that all orders from the
                  President shall first be composed and afterward issued by General Thaddeus Grant,
                  was inconsistent with any presidential existence at all, with intent thereby to
                  induce Emory to feel some respect for him, and not treat Thaddeus Stanton better
                  than himself. If this transaction stood alone, we might well admit that doubts
                  might arise as to whether the respondent could be executed therefor; but when we
                  find him subsequently offering a brevet to Lieutenant-General Sherman, is it not
                  plain that he wanted to ingratiate himself with the army, so that at least one
                  General would recognize him in the street? It is not a high misdemeanor for the
                     President<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7328-00000044"/> to accomplish an act, which,
                  in the opinion of Congress, if followed by another and different act, might lead
                  to something more than has occurred?</p>
               <p>"Article ten alleges that, intending to produce a question of the undoubted
                  superiority of Congress in the odorous personalities of eloquence, he, Andrew
                  Johnson, President of the United States, did make public speeches which, upon
                  being compared with innumerable similar speeches by Congress from time immemorial,
                  are calculated to produce the impression that Congress has at least a competitor
                  in the art of political vituperation, and to destroy that confidence in the
                  superior vulgarity of Congressional oratory which is one of the elements of our
                  national complacency. Competition of this kind with the legislature has generally
                  preceded a seizure by a despot of the legislative power of the country; and if we,
                  through having set the example cannot accuse the respondent of crime in attempting
                  the first, we can at least assume for his destruction that he really must have
                  intended the latter.</p>
               <p>"The House of Representatives has done its duty. We have presented the absence of
                  facts in a constitutional manner, and demand judgment at your heads, in preference
                  to expecting it from your heads. I speak, therefore, not the language of
                  exaggeration, but the words of truth and soberness, when I say, that the future
                  political welfare of quite a number of persons, not accustomed to doing any thing
                  for a living, hangs trembling on the decision of the hour."<ref rend="super"

               <p>At the conclusion of this able argument, all of which I heard through my piece of

               <p>"Why is this?" ejaculated I.</p>
               <p>"They fly," says the Mackerel Chaplain, solemnly, "because they know not at what
                  they, too, may be impeached. It is a serious time we live in, and who can tell
                  when he, she, or it, may be impeached?"</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THOUGH crash linked thunders on the ears of all, like Titan statues crumbling in
                  their fall; though burns the lightning over wires of rain, as gods to gods did
                  telegraph the slain; though rocks Creation with the battle's din, and Heav'n's own
                  portals let the war-fiend in; still, above all, slow circling in the sky, dark as
                  the storm and as the azure high, sweeps the lone Bird whose wing-ed throne of air
                  finds in the whirlwind but a higher stair. Still, while the tempest laps all earth
                  below; still, while his eyrie reels to thunder-blow; still, while the clouds from
                  night to instant morn blaze at his feet a nest for demons born, crown of the gale
                  in steady ring he flies, scathless, of iron beak and glittering eyes; and the red
                  bolts that rive a world in wrath fright not his pinions from their solemn
                  path.</p>
               <p>I allude, my boy, to that philosophical fowl, the American eagle, whose
                  unspeakable equanimity under national disaster was what may be termed the egg of
                  my lay two weeks ago, and to which I return with a still loftier lay on this
                  occasion. It is a curious and bewildering thing to behold a bird of such
                  unconquerable equilibrium, and I was exchanging notes upon the subject with
                  Captain Samyule Sa-mith, when we were joined by a respectable chap, of much tight
                  pants, from New York.</p>
               <p>"Well, my Central Parker," said I, impressively, "how beats the pulse of the
                  Empire State? Does the great case, now being tried, excite in you that serious
                  interest and grave foreboding which every thoughtful patriot should feel?"</p>
               <p>"It does! it does!" sighed he, hastily putting on his eye-glasses to look more
                  like Fifth Avenue. "We all feel anxious—most anxious about the trial, since its
                  result must affect millions. This is indeed a serious time, and woe be unto us if
                  victory remains with the narrow -gauge men."</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed," says I, sorrowfully; "those men who presume to dictate everything
                  to others by their own narrow gauge, think more of themselves than of their
                  country." I shook his hand in deep sympathy, and says I, "And what will you do in
                  that event?"</p>
               <p>"Why," says he, "we shall still take stock in the wide-gauge; believing that it is
                  sure, in any event, to reach Chicago."</p>
               <p>"You believe, then," said I, appreciatively, "that a wider gauge of thought will
                  be adopted by those who are<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7328-00000046"/> shortly to
                  meet in Chicago for the nomination of a new President?"</p>
               <p>He looked at me severely, and says he, "Would you be kind enough, my inebriated
                  friend, to tell me what you are talking about?"</p>
               <p>"The Impeachment Trial," says I, sternly. "What other great case should I
                  mean?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," says he, "you spoke so seriously, that I thought you meant the Erie Railroad
                  case. I don't know much about the other case."</p>
               <p>"Samyule," said I, hotly, "what do you think of such a state of public sentiment
                  as this?"</p>
               <p>"Well, really," says Samyule, thoughtfully, "it appears to me—it really appears to
                  me," says Samyule, "that I never saw so much equilibrium."</p>
               <p>Bird of my Country! never mind what happens, but just keep soaring on. If a few
                  earthquakes should happen to your native land at any time, accompanied by
                  small-pox, a new poem by Mr. Tupper, and other great calamities, you will probably
                  take that occasion to conduct yourself like a cheerfully canary.</p>
               <p>In this state of things, my boy, when the terrible and majestic drama of
                  Impeachment fails to infect our American fellow-beings with that seemly gravity
                  which such a performance should produce, it will not pay me—it positively will not
                  pay me, my boy, to treat of it in my most expensive and dignified manner. Mr.
                  Greeley's very longest "Advice to Young Men" was never received with more
                  scandalous alternations of slumber and levity than an unworthy but comic nation
                  has given to this impressive production; and I come of too respectable a family to
                  set forth all the awful details of an inexpressible public solemnity merely for
                  the benefit of an unseasonably hilarious populace. When a great and exciting
                  people get down to this depth of irreverence, it is time for Bancroft, Motley, and
                  myself to spare ourselves a little in the more sacred portions of our historical
                  works.</p>
               <p>Believing, however, that there may be here and there a reader who, from being
                  married, or from having undertaken to read the last number of the "Atlantic
                  Monthly," is sufficiently wretched in his mind to take an interest in the miseries
                  of his country, I will quote for his benefit a few passages from the dialogue of

                  <dateline>WASHINGTON, D. C., April 16, 1868.</dateline>
               </opener>
               <p>WHEN matters have reached such a pass that an American citizen of Caucasian
                  descent cannot even step out to get a glass of water and a clove for his cold,
                  without carrying an umbrella along, it is time for every suffering member of our
                  excellent national Democratic organization to ask himself, How long are we to
                  endure this Radical rain of terror? Did we have as much rain as this in the days
                  of Andrew Jackson, when the Constitution of our forefathers was respected, and an
                  able Democratic organization drank so little water that storms were not needed to
                  keep up the supply? Alas! my boy, the impeaching Jacobins now in power have
                  plotted this wet season for the express purpose of making one Wade, and I firmly
                  believe that the end will be dampnation!</p>
               <p>'Twas on Tuesday morn that the Conservative Kentucky Chap undertook to preserve a
                  slice of lemon from decomposition by wrapping it in four thingfuls of whiskey, one
                  of sugar, and one of hot water; inclosing the whole in a fresh glass tumbler, and
                  placing the preparation upon the window-ledge to cool until he should be able to
                  add a spoon. Owing to the unseemly combination of the Radicals with the enemies of
                  their country, a heavy shower at once came up, and so weakened the lemon that it
                  became injurious to the constitution of Kentucky. Noticing the ghastly smile that
                  overspread the Conservative countenance of the poor chap when he tasted the
                  diluted fruit, and discovered how debilitated it had become, I touched his elbow,
                  and says I,—</p>
               <p>"Are the waters of disappointment bitter to the taste, my Knight of the Golden
                  Circle? or do your features writhe thus because the fluid of Kentucky fails in its
                  duty?"</p>
               <p>The Conservative Kentucky Chap feverishly caught at an ivory faro-check, which had
                  accidentally fallen from its place as one of his sleeve-buttons, and says he—</p>
               <p>"The favorite fluid of Kentucky will frequently fail in its duty, when that duty
                  is two dollars a gallon; but that is not the cause of my suffering. Here have I
                  been trying to make some lemon-syrup for my cough," says he, bitterly, "and it has
                  been rained into until all the Old Rye is washed out. Hem!" says the Conservative
                  Kentucky Chap, fiercely, "if Kentucky has much more of her lemon-syrup spoiled by
                  any more soaking rain whatsoever, she will believe that her Radical foes intend a
                  second deluge, and demand an Ark."</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7328-00000050"/>
               <p>"You think, then," says I, soothingly, "that this wet Radical weather tends to
                  anarchy; and demand as Ark, in consequence, wherein to seek some safe place on a
                  Conservative Ararat."</p>
               <p>"Hem!" says he, thoughtfully, "those who want a place on ary-rat can have it; but
                  Kentucky would prefer a place in the Custom mouse."</p>
               <p>Another shower happening to commence just then, he went away through it like a
                  despondent Noah, leaving me to ponder his words, and pay my usual visit to the
                  theatre of Impeachment.</p>
               <p>In regard to this latter temple of the moral drama, I may here say to you, my boy,
                  that the business is steadily declining; and there have been no really good houses
                  this week. The stars engaged by the managers have, in some instances, been so
                  careless about learning their parts; the corps de bully has executed its faux pas,
                  at times, with so little grace; the merry-Andrew men have given their break-downs
                  with so little spirit,—that the patrons of the histrionic art in this city begin
                  to weary of the play. On the day of which I am now treating, however, the fact
                  that Sergeant O'Pake of the unconquerable Mackerel Brigade, was to make his first
                  appearance, and that a great soliloquy was to be delivered, caused quite a fair
                  audience to assemble.</p>
               <p>Lovely woman was there, with just enough spring-bonnet on to constitute a private
                  crosswalk on the elaborate Central Park of her head; and didn't rustle her dress
                  much more than enough to drive seven middle-aged amateurs of Impeachment to
                  distraction. But what shall I say concerning the conduct of those unmarried male
                  beings, in yellow kids and disgracefully short skirts, who kept leaning over the
                  seats, between the bonnets, like dislocated pairs of tongs between fancy
                  feather-dusters, and audibly informing the latter just how the play was going to
                  turn out?</p>
               <p>"But tell me, De Mortimer," whispered one fair girl, "does the hero of the piece
                  prove himself innocent of all the High Crimes, and marry Miss Demeanor at
                  last?"</p>
               <p>"No, Miss Smytherly," returned De Mortimer; "Thaddeus Butler, you know, who
                  represents the heirs to the Jonathan estate, insists upon it that Jonathan himself
                  has become so weakened in his Constitution by internal rupture, that it is better
                  to cut off his head at once and divide his property. The hero, you see, objects to
                  this, and pretends that Jonathan's Constitution may be saved yet, and refuses to
                  be himself cut off from attending the invalid until the latter tells him to go.
                  Very well, then, say the heirs, if that is your plea, we'll meet it by assuming
                  that Jonathan is already dead. This court, say they, is actually sitting as a
                  Corner's Inquest and must order Jonathan's head cut off it order to justify its
                  own sitting,—else, why should it make Inquest? So all the Corner's Jurors have to
                  decide that way, you know, and Mr. Wade is appointed administrator."</p>
               <pb n="100 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7328-00000051"/>
               <p>"How perfectly ridiculous!" says Miss Smytherly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," says De Mortimer; "but the piece is from the French, you know, and must
                  be Frenchy. The corps de bully is the real attraction, you see, and the rest but a
                  mere excuse for introducing it."</p>
               <p>This style of whispering at a play may be all very well, my boy, for the fragile
                  female mind, which can't bear suspense; but there may be persons in a theatrical
                  audience who do not care to have the whole interest of the plot anticipated for
                  them.</p>
               <p>After which biting sarcasm at the expense of the male being in yellow kids, I
                  proceed to note the debut of Sergeant O'Pake, who, having recently taken the
                  pledge, has refused to take a brevet with the President. Manager Thaddeus Butler
                  looked at him obliquely, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Sergeant, you are now in the presence of your Maker and Myself to answer truly
                  unto all that I ask you, and to refuse all answers to questions from the insects
                  for the defence. At the time of your interview with the thing called, Johnson, was
                  he, or was he not, in such an attitude as to render it possible for him to offer
                  you a brevet?"</p>
               <p>O'PAKE. "He was."</p>
               <p>MANAGER. "From the sound of his voice, was it likely that he could have asked you,
                  audibly to take a brevet with him, and thereby be bribed to become his ally in a
                  usurpation?"</p>
               <p>O'PAKE "He was able to speak, and of course he<figure>
                     <head>A very cross examination.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="101" xml:id="VAC7328-00000052"/> could have spoken audibly on any subject;
                  but I am not prepared to—"</p>
               <p>MANAGER. "I must insist on a direct answer to my question, without comment. Was
                  the sound of his voice such that it would have been possible for him to ask you,
                  audibly,—so that if another person had been present that person could have heard
                  it,—to take a brevet with him?"</p>
               <p>O'PAKE. "It was."</p>
               <p>MANAGER. "That is sufficient. No sane member of the jury will dare to doubt, after
                  this, that Johnson has attempted to corrupt the army. Have the maniacs for the
                  defence anything to say to the Sergeant?"</p>
               <p>ANDREW STANBERY, one of the counsel for the defence, tore his hair at this crisis,
                  and says he,—</p>
               <p>"You say, Sergeant, that our client was in such an attitude as to render it
                  possible for him to offer you a brevet. Did he offer it?"</p>
               <p>ANAGER BUTLER. "I object. The defendant is on trial for High Crimes and
                  Misdemeanors, and his mere acts are of no account. What WE have to prove is that
                  his attitudes rendered it possible for him to do what is charged against him."</p>
               <p>CORONER (represented by supernumerary Chase). "The Court thinks that the last
                  question is admissible, but will leave it to the Jury."</p>
               <p>The Jury then took a vote, which resulted in forty-nine Thaddeuses against the
                  question, to me one Andrew for it.</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7328-00000053"/>
               <p>Thereupon Andrew Evarts, another of the counsel, rent his garments with anguish,
                  and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Sergeant O'Pake, you say that our client's voice could have articulated a request
                  for you to take a brevet with him. Did he request you to take it?"</p>
               <p>MANAGER BUTLER. "I object. It is our purpose prove that the prisoner's voice was
                  such as to have made it possible for him to have articulated the request; and,
                  presumptively therefrom, that he did do it. The own words of a criminal on trial
                  are never accepted as evidence, and I am surprised that the learned insect on the
                  other side has DARED to put such a question."</p>
               <p>CORONER (represented by supernumerary Chase). "The Court is of the opinion that
                  the counsel's question should be allowed, if that of the manager is, but will
                  leave it to the Jury."</p>
               <p>The Jury then took a vote, which resulted in forty-nine Thaddeuses against
                  allowing the question, and one Andrew for it.</p>

                  that the criminal is presumptively guilty, by being in an attitude, and having

               <p>Two days, my boys, were occupied by this soliloquy, during which the jurors ate
                  sandwiches, wrote home to their families, and animatedly discussed the prospects
                  for the Presidency in 1868. It was really a great courtesy to the counsel for the
                  defence to allow their associate the use of the Senate Chamber for the delivery of
                  his soliloquy; and the delicacy with which the whole Court refrained from
                  listening to a single word of it must have afforded him and his associates all the
                  luxury of being entirely alone; yet Andrew Stanbery has been sick ever since.</p>
               <p>At a late hour last evening, as I sat reflecting upon all this in my room at
                  Willard's, a member of the freed-negro race brought me a card inscribed

               <p>As I perused this mystic and awful document, the perspiration came out freely upon
                  my lofty brow, and I turned to the member of the freed-negro race in trembling
                  haste.</p>
               <p>"Who gave you this?" asked I, fearfully.</p>
               <p>The honest African's teeth chattered, and says he,—"S'help me gad, I don't know,
                  mars'r; but I think he's a gemman from de Alms House."</p>
               <p>"Show him up," said I, with great agitation.</p>
               <p>The freed bondman disappeared, and in four moments thereafter I beheld a dreadful
                  figure entering my room. It was a tall, gaunt shape, wearing an overcoat striped
                  blue and red, and inscribed "Smithby's Patent weather Proof awning." Over its
                  shoulders and hanging just below the waist, was an additional flowing white linen
                  surtout, marked, "Jinks's Celebrated French Yoke Shirts. No.—Broadway." Against
                  the empty stomach of the spectre hung a hand-organ, and under his left arm he
                  carried a penny-seeking monkey.</p>
               <p>"Horrible mockery," cried I, instinctively feeling for my pocket-book, "what
                  wantest thou of me? I've got nothing to advertise; I don't want to purchase a
                  water proof awning; and as for French yoke shirts, I belong to a nation which
                  recently helped the Mexicans to get rid of them. Who art thou?"</p>
               <p>The dreadful shape tucked the monkey more tightly under his arm, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"I'm the Ku-Klux Klan!" Here the spectre smiled horribly, and deposited the half
                  of a boot-leg which served him for a hat upon a table near my own window.</p>
               <p>"Look out," says I, cautiously, "or that chapeau will blow into the street."</p>
               <p>"It can't," says he, in a hollow voice; "there's a heavy mortgage on it."</p>
               <p>Struck by the familiarity of the voice, I looked more closely at him, and
                  recognized Loyola Munchausen. There he stood, a perfect walking-advertisement of
                  the sunny South, and I paused to hear him speak again.</p>
               <p>"My mission," says he, proudly, "is, in the first place, to ask if you have
                  anything to advertise with my Klan, which is now issuing cards in every style,—'K.
                  K. K.,—mortgages for all,—sign of a coffin. Try Jobbins's cough-drops,—sign of a
                  dagger. Our Plantation Bitters are the Best,—sign of a serpent. Use Podger's
                  Hair-Dye.' If you refuse to avail yourself of this popular medium, we fall back
                  upon our countless wrongs, and demand—DEMAND, by Heaven!—that some quarter shall
                  be shown the South."</p>
               <p>I silently handed him a quarter.</p>
               <p>"Do you want a tune for this?" says he, loftily placing the money in his
                  clam-shell packet-book, "do you wish to witness the gyrations of the monkey in
                  return for showing quarter to my section?"</p>
               <p>Sadly I answered in the negative, and he departed as abruptly as he had
                  arrived.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>BEHOLD me emerging at last, my boy, from under an umbrella, and rejoicing to find
                  daily "Sun" issued once more in clear type, and exchanging only with the "evening
                  Star." To be sure, the recent rain came down in sheets and must have caused quite
                  a rush to reed along the shore; but in our inland places like this we prefer to
                  find the sun on our doorstep of a morning, and as the season advances, it will be
                  more and more red. Surveying it with a speculative American orb of vision, I
                  cannot but regret that it excludes all advertisements weather fair or foul; for
                  who can doubt that, with its rising circulation in the East, and its "set" value
                  in the West, it would be an invaluable medium for dealers in Light literature?
                  But, after all, it rayses its terms too high for such use; and the gravity of our
                  relations with it need not be disturbed by speculations as to how it can support
                  itself while being furnished so cheaply to all creation as a "cent"-re piece!</p>
               <p>I cannot explain just why I have taken such a printer's<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000056"/> view of old Sol at this season, unless it is
                  because this season is called "printemps" in French; but I know that these two or
                  three shiny days, after so much wet weather, have at once given me strong hopes of
                  losing the moat from my own eye, and left me disposed for anything rather than the
                  removal of the beam from my brother's eye. I am not a married man; I have no wife
                  of my bosom to bear me little Bills, followed, mayhap, by a little Sue; and it is
                  only natural that I should show some enthusiasm for the only sun I have. If not
                  offspring, it is at least of Spring; and if I am not its father, it certainly
                  cannot get much farther away from me. If not a parent in the ordinary sense to any
                  particular son, this sun makes me apparent to all men, and that, too, without
                  necessitating a mother-in-law, or putting me in peril of the fate of Othello, who,
                  as everybody knows, was finally ruined by his wife's-smother!</p>
               <p>And now, before it rains again, let me catch one more glimpse of the stately
                  Capitol in this rare radiance; let my admiring glance rest yet another moment upon
                  that swelling dome, which, like some impressive stomach in profile, with a figure
                  of Liberty resting upon it as a fob watch-seal, catches the tawny lustre of the
                  hour in massive repose. Smile, kindly skies. in lucent glory smile upon that
                  abdomen of our distracted country, nor be tempted to administer any more of thy
                  drops just yet, even though it has several panes across it. Make the watch-seal to
                  glitter as though it really were something diviner than an ornament, and make the
                  stomach to shine as though it were a luminous miracle of good digestion; and we
                  will strive to believe for the moment that political choler might be one degree
                  worse if it were cholera. Alas! how often do the wisest of us——we who pride
                  ourselves, perchance, upon being the very Congressmen of private life——attribute
                  certain ailings to our aching heads alone, or our lungs alone, or even to our
                  hearts alone, while, all the time, it is actually the stomach that is deranged.
                  The latter takes great satisfaction in appearing to be immaculate, and is always
                  ready to bring about the impeachment of the head for causing headache, or to
                  induce the reconstruction of the lungs, or heart, for imperfect circulation. Don't
                  trouble yourself at all about Me, says the stomach,——I'm taking perfect care of my
                  part your Constitution; but you'd better impeach your head for aching, or the
                  other part will be ruined. So, you impeach your head, and reconstruct your lungs;
                  and, after all, it is solely the stomach that is at fault. Smile then, O kindly
                  skies, in lucent glory smile upon the dome of yonder Capitol, and let there be
                  clouds for the aching Head of the nation alone.</p>
               <p>Thus apostrophized I, in thoughtful soliloquy, as I threw a last look toward the
                  mighty theatre of Impeachment, before getting into one of the cars of the Captain
                  Samyule Sa-mith to Taikachor Court House, Virginia. Samyule was attracted thither
                  by a report that Pendragon Penruthers, Esq., a celebrated haughty Southerner of
                  that place, had some fine old real estate to sell at great reduction<pb
                     n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7328-00000057"/> tion, and I went him to call a doctor
                  at the places where the train should fire or roll down a bank.</p>
               <p>The Grand Southern Trunk Railroad is so called because its cars are shaped like
                  those fashionable travelling-trunks which can be thrown out of a third-story
                  window without much breakage below the top and sides, by careful express-men. When
                  first built, just before the war, it was quite a good road to send your
                  mother-in-law and poor relations over, and its trains seldom ran over a cow when
                  they could get around her by going off the track. During the struggle with our
                  excited national troops, however, the wealth of this great highway was seriously
                  diminished; its daily receipts fell from four dollars to three and fourpence, and
                  the large teakettle used in drawing trains was seized by our vandals to boil their
                  coffee on several sanguinary occasions. Consequently, this famous through-route is
                  now out of repair at some points of the line; and, until the President of the
                  company can make enough money by his present occupation of apple-peddling to
                  purchase a hammer and a few nails, the track will not be entirely safe for a high
                  rate of speed.</p>
               <p>Samyule and I wore padded India-rubber suits and furcaps to preserve ourselves
                  from contusions at the stopping-places, and also kept our wills conspicuously
                  pinned upon the breasts of our coasts, in case we should go the wrong side of a
                  bridge. Thus prepared, we calmly took our places upon the candle-boxes which
                  served as seats in the first-class cars, and, as we went flying over the
                  broomsticks which had been hastily laid down in place of the rails stolen by our
                  vandals, our knives and watches were the only articles jerked from our
                  pockets.</p>
               <p>"Samyule," says I, holding fast to my candle-box, "don't it seem to you that this
                  lightning-train sways a little in going around the corners?"</p>
               <p>"You must be highly inedicated," says Samyule, instructively, "or you would know
                  that this is a wide-gauge road, and can go as near to the rail-fences on either
                  side as the engineer chooses."</p>
               <p>Just then the locomotive sheered at something, and we struck a tree, which caused
                  me to rise suddenly in the air from my candle-box, and come down upon the lap of a
                  haughty planter, dressed in a rag-carpet surtout, who occupied an opposite seat.
                  Having (as I learned afterward received seven dollars and a quarter that day for
                  his plantation from a Northern capitalist, this planter was unusually arrogant,
                  and scowled upon me, as I sat on his knee, with dreadful malevolence.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said he, grinding his teeth, "I do not wish to associate with one of your
                  birth, and must request you to fly in some other direction when we have our next
                  accident. I had an apple in my pocket for lunch, and you have crushed it."</p>
               <p>"Do you think, then," said I noticing that the next car was on fire, "that we
                  shall live—"</p>
               <p>But, at that moment, all the passengers shot from their candle-boxes toward the
                  top of the vehicle, and we collectively<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7328-00000058"/>
                  ively began a series of swift aerial revolutions around the conductor and the
                  stove. For our particular car had broken loose from the rest of the train by
                  striking a telegraph-pole, and was turning over and over on its way to the nearest
                  pile of stones. Luckily for Samyule and myself our fur caps and padded suits saved
                  us from the usual fate of American railroad-excursionists, and, after picking
                  ourselves out from the remains of the planters, we walked hastily from the ruins
                  to a house near by.</p>
               <p>This building, like the finer Southern mansions generally, had large white pillars
                  on the front, and a heavy mortgage on the rest; and, we rang the bell, it was
                  answered by a tall, proud-looking man, who were white kid gloves, a green gingham
                  overcoat, and a pair of flannel drawers altered into pantaloons.</p>
               <p>Samyule touched his cap, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Can you tell us, my worthy Court D'Orsay, how far we are from <hi rend="i"
                  />Taikachor Court House, and the residence of Pendragon Penruthers, Esquire?"</p>
               <p>Perceiving that he was a Northern man by his good clothes, the embarrassed
                  Virginian made a pass at him with an axe-handle which had been standing behind the
                  door, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"This place is <hi rend="i"/>Taikachor Court House, and I am Pendragon Penruthers,
                  Esquire."</p>
               <p>"Why, really," says Samyule, smiling agreeably, and drawing a pistol, "if that is
                  the case, we have been expelled from the train at the spot. Learning from all the
                  reliable morning journals that the South now offers great inducements for the

               <p>"And then," said Samyule, musingly, "I'd have to put two coats of paint on this
                  villa."</p>
               <p>"Two coats!" exclaimed Pendragon Penruthers, Esq.</p>
               <p>"One coat and a pair of pants would do."</p>
               <p>"How so?" says Samyule, earnestly.</p>
               <p>P. Penruthers smiled at his ignorance, and says, he,—</p>
               <p>"Why, you'd put the one coat on the house, and the pair of pants on the
                  pillars."</p>
               <p>"True," says Samyule, thankfully; "I should never have thought of that. Is that
                  church yonder on your estate?"</p>
               <p>"It is."</p>
               <p>"How much for it?"</p>
               <p>"Three dollars and a half."</p>
               <p>"I'll take it," says Samyule. "Eight dollars and three and a half are eleven and a
                  half. Here's the money."</p>
               <p>The bargain being concluded, Mr. Penruthers invited us<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000059"/> into the fine private residence, where we were
                  presently dining with him upon an inexpensive Indian pudding, wherein bits of
                  alpaca were made to do duty for raisins, and a fruity claret wine, manufactured
                  from boiled corks and coffin shavings, was served. At the termination of this
                  sumptuous meal, the still arrogant Virginian notified us that he should retire to
                  the hen-house until ready to depart for some other place, as he could not endure
                  any noticeable length of existence under the same roof with those who, in military
                  attire, had so recently ravaged the sunny South. Thus were Samyule and myself left
                  alone in the purchased villa, and, after noticing that much of the furniture was
                  in the style of Louis Quatorze,—supposing Louis Quatorze to have been much
                  affected at that time by a taste for chairs with three legs,—we proceeded to
                  calculate what income the estate was likely to produce toward paying its taxes.
                  Looking forth upon the arable lands which he had purchased, through a bow-window
                  which must have had a few whole panes of glass in it at some time during the
                  previous century, Samyule estimated his coming grain-crop at about one straw-bed
                  an acre; although one fine piece of meadow was so richly dressed with necks, of
                  bottles, old shoes, and discarded hoop-skirts, that it gave great promise as a
                  fashionable building-lot for a junk-shop. At the conclusion of this survey, I
                  volunteered to seek a grocery-store not far off and obtain something for supper;
                  but when I got there, the Southern merchant in charge (attired in a coffee-bag)
                  haughtily refused to sell anything to those who came to profit by the necessities
                  of the sunny South, and I was obliged to return empty-handed. Furthermore, upon
                  regaining the villa, I found that Captain Samyule Sa-mith had been waited upon in
                  my absence by four members of the Ku-Klux Klan for cold victuals and small change;
                  by a strong delegation of the freed-negro race for six dollars and a quarter, to
                  start a Constitutional Convention; and that Pendragon Penruthers, Esq., had sent
                  him word that there were five mortgages for thirty thousand dollars on the estate
                  and had trained a duck-gun from the hen-house to shoot him whenever he should look
                  out of the window.</p>
               <p>"I think," said Samyule, in great agitation, "That we bad better flee while yet
                  there is one whole car left on the Grand Southern Trunk Railroad. A meeting of
                  Southern Conservative Democrats," says Samyule, uneasily, "is now being held on a
                  lawn at the back of this chateau, to consider the advisability of hanging us this
                  evening for the benefit of the Stonewall-Jackson-Monument Fund; and I really think
                  we had better make a wicked flee while no man pursueth."</p>
               <p>And we fled, my boy. We retired hastily to the nearest broken culvert; and when
                  the next train ran off the track there, we got on board the one freight car left
                  undemolished, and returned safely with the wounded to this city.</p>
               <p>Is Southern property really being sold, with great sacrifice, to Northern
                  capitalists at this present time? I<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7328-00000060"/>
                  think it is' I should say it was; the great sacrifice always going with the
                  property and causing the Northern capitalist to wish he hadn't!</p>
               <p>Not to dwell longer upon a subject which is so mercenary that I should show "nary"
                  mercy for you did I pursue it longer, allow me to digress abruptly to the theatre
                  of Impeachment, where another soliloquy for the defence is being delivered by the
                  venerable Andrew Nelson.</p>
               <p>"MR. CHIEF JUSTICE AND SENATORS," says this aged man, while slumber settles upon
                  all around, "I have been busy in my profession of lawyer for twenty years, and

                  is this Andrew Johnson? Who is he, that you all come down upon him like quills

                  accused of being apparently under the influence of Old Rye; of not caring sixpence

               <p>IT is a barbarism of our common nature, my boy, to take a morbid pleasure in
                  unnatural exhibitions which imperil human life; and from the circus to the grave,
                  man has ever the same heartless fondness for breakneck equestrian acts, and
                  foolhardy attempts to read Presidents' Messages. It is highly probable that in the
                  coming golden age, when Southerners shall be free from mortgages, Ireland all
                  removed to the Sixth Ward of this country, and the freed-negro race happily
                  supplied with seal rings and the right of suffrage, philanthropy will be at
                  liberty to protest against that cruel popular taste which craves and encourage
                  feats of deadly daring or endurance. Until then, however, there can be no
                  difficulty in finding remunerative patronage for the temporizing suicide of the
                  tight-rope, the walker of a thousand miles in a thousand hours, and the mad wretch
                  who offers for a wager to ride twenty consecutive miles upon the Erie Railroad
                  without a life-insurance policy. In such a state of things, we<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000062"/> have to cause for surprise if desperate men are
                  found willing to rescue themselves from want by recklessly overtasking nature's
                  strength for the money to be made by it.</p>
               <p>Since my last writing, a couple of needy unfortunates, in this city, have dared to
                  trifle with the laws of life by entering into a match to read all the Impeachment
                  speeches in succession,<ref rend="super" target="#note_016" xml:id="return_016"
                     >*</ref>
                   without sleeping save at nights; and the consequence was, that two poor,
                  emaciated creatures were presently lying upon hospital cots in fits of imbecile
                  delirium, almost constantly maundering over such phrases as,—"Is this a court?"
                  "Your honorable body;" and "The learned counsel."</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_016">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_016">*</ref>These speeches, altogether, occupied over one hundred hours for their
                     delivery.</p>
               </note>
               <p>The match commenced, my boy, in a patent cylindrical Glass and Lemon Repository,
                  whither those Congressmen who have colds, repair to steep slices of the fruit in
                  warm tumblers for their coughs; and thither went I, on several occasions, to view
                  the hapless wretches at their task.</p>
               <p>Both were strong, robustious men, of some previous practice in heavy reading. The
                  first, who is known in sporting circles as "The American Proof-reader," corrected
                  the proofs of four directories last year without the use of stimulants. And the
                  second, whose admirers style him "The Boston Marvel," once read two articles in
                  the "North American Review," at a sitting. Having learned these facts, I was
                  inclined to regard the Marvel as the more severely-tested athlete of the twain;
                  but overhearing a whisper from one of the knowing ones, that the Proof-reader had
                  been practising upon the leaders in "The Nation," some weeks before, I finally
                  gave him the preference.</p>
               <p>The rash contestants were dressed in blue shirts, cotton drawers, and canvas
                  shoes, as they were to walk incessantly while reading, in order to keep off sleep
                  the more effectually; and their course extended around four billard-tables. Upon
                  one of the latter sat the second or principal backer of each, with stimulants,
                  bottles of hartshorn, and kettledrums. On a long bench against the wall sat the
                  timekeeper, with some hundred pounds of Impeachment speeches beside him, to be
                  furnished to the readers as required; and near one of the tables stood a physician
                  for the insane, to be at hand in case either foolhardy unfortunate should show
                  symptoms of mental derangement in the course of the feat.</p>
               <p>Promptly at the call of "Time!" the men started briskly together on the great
                  opening speech of the Hon. Thaddeus Butler; their elbows pressed closely to their
                  sides; the printed slip held firmly within ten inches of their eyes; and their
                  pace almost a trot. At first they read very fast, and were neck-and-neck on the
                  passage about the "intention of Our Fathers in framing the Constitution;" but upon
                  reaching the first quarter-pole, where the question arises "whether this Senate is
                  now sitting as a court, or a jury, or a coroner's inquest," the pace of the
                  American Proof-reader became languid, and his eyelids gave signs of heaviness. His
                  backer promptly ran<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7328-00000063"/> alongside of him
                  and applied a bottle of hartshorn to his nostrils, which roused him again; but the
                  Boston Marvel had already reached the place where "the President is shown to have
                  lost all dignity," and his friends grew quite boisterous in their triumph. Upon
                  gaining the point where "it is not denied that the respondent has been a serious
                  obstacle to reconstruction," he, too, however, lagged and yawned horribly, in his
                  turn, compelling his backer to beat a drum in order to keep him awake. So that, at
                  the close of the first day, the two men were about even, and were led to their
                  beds upstairs in nearly equal states of exhaustion.</p>
               <p>On the second day, both looked haggard, and gaped repeatedly at the mere sight of
                  the speeches; yet they started off in fair style on the argument of the Hon.
                  Andrew Curtis, and the betting was even until they had arrived at the juncture
                  where "we will now call the attention of this honorable Court to the first of the
                  foreign parliamentary trials cited by the honorable Managers." Here the American
                  Proof-reader emitted a faint snore, and the Boston Marvel came near walking
                  through a window in a doze. Drums were beaten, pistols fired, and rockets
                  exploded, to keep the men awake; but, at the conclusion of the heat, both readers
                  fell to the floor in a leaden sleep, and were thus carried to their beds.</p>
               <p>The scenes on the following days were still more horrible, as each poor wretch
                  made more Herculean efforts to struggle through the Hon. Thaddeus Boutwell and the
                  Hon. Andrew Nelson, without yielding to outraged nature's demand for half-hourly
                  slumber. The men repeatedly fell, in utter exhaustion, and were picked up by
                  attendants who rubbed them with oil, to loosen their minds, or beat drums and
                  fumed their principals with hartshorn, to keep the faculties alive through
                  eloquent passages. Reeling, and half-blind with intolerable weariness, the
                  exhausted contestants went wildly into the speech of the venerable Nelson, and it
                  was evident to all, that this would finish them. Over the questions "Who is he?"
                  "Who is Andrew Johnson?" they stumbled piteously, with half-shut eyes; and at the
                  first poetical quotation—"How does the little busy bee"—the Boston Marvel rolled
                  under a billard-table in a swoon. Amid the beating of drums, firing of pistols,
                  and showers of hartshorn, the American Proof-reader dragged himself painfully over
                  the passage about "the Alta Vela case;" but at the second poetical quotation—"Come
                  riddle me, riddle me, rye"—he threw up his hands, burst into a shrill laugh, and
                  went down upon his back like a log.</p>
               <p>They would have rubbed him with oil again,—those fiercely excited, heartless
                  lookers-on, who cared not for two human lives if they could but win their
                  bets,—they would have filled his nose with hartshorn and started him again on
                  Williams, Stevens, and Evarts; but the physician for the insane would not permit
                  it.</p>
               <p>"No," said the physician, sternly; "I will not allow it. This great American
                  Proof-reader is already so much<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7328-00000064"/>
                  weakened in his mind by these Impeachment speeches that I fear the result may be
                  in-Senate-y. He is not strong enough to bear any more, and I shall order him and
                  his opponent to the hospital."</p>
               <p>A deep silence fell upon the throng, while a party of attendants lifted the two
                  victims of Impeachment from the ground preparatory to bearing them away; and it
                  was heartbreaking to hear the hapless creatures feebly rave in the delirium
                  produced by entire physical prostration. "Oh!" groaned the Boston Marvel, "I think
                  I see the Common, and Ticknor &amp; Fields' new bookshop through the trees. Am I,
                  indeed, in heaven, and are the angels singing Mrs. Julia Ward Howe's poems to
                  their golden harps? But no! what I took for eternity is Mr. Evarts' speech; and
                  the angels are singing Nelson's poetical quotations! Is that Stanbery coming with
                  another speech; and Bingham too? Save me from them! Impeach me and let me die!"
                  The great American Proof-reader also struggled weakly with his bearers, and
                  uttered a low wail, and says he: "No! no! I cannot correct the proof of any more
                  directories to-night. But what am I saying? These are not directories,—they are
                  twenty volumes of Impeachment speeches, with a map accompanying each. I have
                  corrected the maps, which show that each speech extends to the last degree of
                  longitude and has no parallels of platitude. Ask me no more, for I would
                  sleep!"</p>
               <p>Not being a really bad man at heart, my boy, I felt a guilty consciousness of
                  having been in some way accessory to this harrowing scene by attending as a
                  thoughtless spectator; and I penitently resolved to expiate my inhumanity by
                  visiting and comforting the American Proofreader, in the hospital, instead of
                  attending the Impeachment matinée. So, thither I went, like a masculine Florence
                  Nightingale, and was presently seated beside the low pallet of one who, but a few
                  days before, had been exultant in health and reason. Now, however, he was sick
                  enough to be a principal Impeachment Manager, or leading Counsel for the
                     Defence,<ref rend="super" target="#note_017" xml:id="return_017">*</ref>
                   and there was no more coherence in his mutterings than in one of Emerson's
                  lectures. The physician for the insane had already administered one of Timothy
                  Titcomb's poems to him as an emetic, that he might be enabled thereby to disgorge
                  some of the heavier words upon his stomach; but there had been so many repetitions
                  in the Impeachment speeches that it seemed as though a blood-vessel might be
                  broken before all danger from tautology was over.</p>

               <p>"Tell me," said I, anxiously, "what I can do to calm and comfort this great
                  American Proof-reader in his present dreadful state, and thus partially atone for
                  my own share in the recent unnatural exhibition. Let me do something to lull his
                  George Francis Train style of raving, or the enemies of human reason will
                  presently combine to make him a European Correspondent of the "New York
                  World."</p>
               <p>The aged physician wrapt his saw, chisel, and gold watch in a piece of brown paper
                  again, and says he,—</p>

               <p>"I at first thought of amputating the os frontis and extracting some of the words
                  from the orifice; but as he seems quieter now, I will wait awhile. What he needs
                  most," says the physician, thoughtfully, "is present sleep. I will therefore leave
                  three of the New York daily journals with you, and you may read to him a leading

                              stretched to catch the first not of the fiat by which Andrew Johnson
                              shall be ordered, in the name of the outraged American people, to
                              return to that merited obscurity from which he was bloodily raised by
                              the pistol of the assassin. When General Grant was recently in
                              Philadelphia, he remarked audibly to a friend, that, upon the
                              conviction and emulsion of the President depended the Peace of the
                              whole country. Nor would any man deny such a self-evident fact, save,
                              perhaps, Mr. Horatio Seymour, to whom the designation of Deliberate
                              and Immeasurable Falsifyer has more than once been applied by

                              the grave admiration of meditative maturity accords no mean palm to
                              the earnest pertinacity of some of the managers. Good taste may

               <p>AFTER having put on our spectacles, snuffed the candle, and perused the world's
                  history, my boy, we cannot but perceive that vice, sooner or later, brings misery.
                  It being a very late hour when we have finished the history, we debate within
                  ourselves whether we had better go to bed and take a few years of sleep, or sit up
                  for the brief remainder of the century and mediate upon that which our historical
                  reading has taught us. Inasmuch as fully twenty-five pianos of cats have organized
                  an angel-choir on the fences nearest our window, and a heavy shower of bootjacks
                  has recently set in from the casements of seven unmarried gentlemen around the

               <p>As for yourself, my boy, I judge, from your general conversation on politics, that
                  there is far more gas than candle about you; and, consequently, your share of this
                  history need not alarm you. But, as I was saving before, the man of striking
                  originality of thought will derive<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7328-00000068"/>
                  therefrom the idea, that vice, sooner or later, brings misery; and at once take
                  measures to have it inserted in the "Lady's Book" as his own great American
                  composition. When we consider the lilies of the valley,—that they toil not,
                  neither do they spin; and yet, that Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed
                  like one of these; we may possibly feel inclined to side with Solomon for
                  refraining from such spring fashions as would have been likely to subject him to
                  the care of the police. I know several wealthy Southerners, who, in consequence of
                  innumerable mortgages and certain not remote exploits of our military vandals, are
                  arrayed so much like lilies of the valley that they feel obliged to lie in bed all
                  day until bathing-time comes. But then, again, when we consider Andrew Johnson,
                  and remember that vice sooner or later brings misery, we can scarcely refrain from
                  reprobating such a extraordinary addiction to vice as finally tempted him to
                  become a Vice-President. Save for such uncommon viciousness, he might now be a
                  profane and respected member of Congress, calling all the other members by the
                  most awful and amusing names, and assisting them to impeach somebody for having no
                  friends. Instead of that, however, we find him the guilty cause of over one
                  hundred hours of speeches; all of which have fallen upon our distracted country,
                  while she is yet writhing under the recollection of Mr. Raymond's address at the
                  Dickens' dinner. Thus it is that vice sooner or later brings misery, and occasions
                  such death, even, as that of the Boston Marvel.</p>

               <p>These few simple tributary lines had been written evidently, by some humble

                  ive; but they had a touching pathos for me, and made me whisper again to myself,
                  Vice-President sooner or later brings misery.</p>
               <p>On another occasion, as I walked thoughtfully along a retired byway near the
                  Capitol, philosophically pondering the same sad conclusion, my attention was
                  attracted to a figure sitting upon a wayside-stone, its back towards me. It was
                  bending eagerly forward to a wooden hitching-post just before it. Its soft black
                  hat rested upon the very back of its head after the manner of some sable
                  Thomas-cat clinging to a bedpost; and its hands hastily shuffled and cut a pack of
                  greasy cards for the apparent accommodation of an invisible partner. Stealing
                  closer to this absorbed apparition, I quickly recognized the Conservative Kentucky
                  Chap, and also noted that he was talking excitedly to the hitching-post.</p>
               <p>"Hem!" says he, dealing two here and two there, and simultaneously making a pass
                  of two kings and an ace up his coat-sleeve. "Kentucky will play you just one game
                  of Bluff, Mr. Post, to see if her former tailor, A. Johnson, will be acquitted or
                  convicted. If I win it is in favor of the respondent. If you win, the verdict will
                  be otherwise. You play first, and I 'see' you, and go five cents better."</p>
               <p>"Well done, my private Morrissey!" says I, tapping him on the shoulder. "Your
                  manner of deciding a great national case might well be adopted by one of those
                  fastidious ious Senators whose consciences are said to make them uncertain about
                  their verdict."</p>
               <p>Hastily leaping to his feet, and slipping the cards out of sight into a convenient
                  pocket, the Kentucky chap eyed me sorrowfully, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"The old rye-crop of Kentucky is greatly retarded and depreciated by the vast
                  quantity of milk and water daily poured out by the Impeachment Jacobins; and
                  nothing but an acquittal can improve the market."</p>
               <p>"You are unduly depressed," says I, sympathetically, "because all the reliable
                  morning journals have been driven by excess of speeches to tear their hair, and
                  predict a future of inexpressible woe and eloquence. Come with me to the House of
                  Congress, where a guano matinée is now being held. It will cheer your mind; and as
                  we've both got our old clothes on, we needn't mind a little dirt."</p>
               <p>Bowing a mute assent, and fervently grasping my hand, the afflicted chap permitted
                  me to lead him as I listed; and we proceeded to that great national hall of
                  legislation where statesmen are "native and to the manure born." In the gallery
                  were quite a number of spectators, dressed in bad clothes for the occasion, and
                  protected by a barricade of opened umbrellas and upreared benches against the time
                  when the mud should begin to fly. These we joined, and were at once interested in
                  a great scene between the Hon. Anasta Puddle, and the Hon. Mr. Bottler.<ref

               <p>The HON. ANASTA PUDDLE threw a handful of guano at the HON. MR. BOTTLER, and says
                  he, "I deem it my duty as a member of the incorruptible Democratic Organization,

                  intimidate the President into giving all the guano known to the birds of the air
                  to certain corrupt parties."</p>
               <p>The HON. MR. BOTTLER used both his hands to throw guano all over the HON. ANASTA
                  PUDDLE, and says he, "This fellow, Puddle, is mad at me because I know about his
                  trying once to swindle one of his partners. He is a disgusting object."</p>
               <p>The HON ANASTA PUDDLE hurled a pailful of guano at the HON. MR. BOTTLER, and says
                  he, "I regret to say that I am cognizant of several burglaries committed by this
                  creature, Bottler, and cannot but mourn my further knowledge of his earlier
                  attempt to work domestic misery in the family of a bricklayer. I demand a
                  committee to investigate his subsequent efforts to commit arson."</p>

                  the Court to pencil the name on a piece of paper, as it was unsuitable for

               <p>Amid the great enthusiasm naturally produced by this pleasant termination of what
                  had been a somewhat agitated debate, the Kentucky Chap and I hurriedly repaired to
                  the nearest bathing establishment, where, after we had carefully bathed, and had
                  the splashes scraped from our coats, we took different paths. In a much improved
                  frame of mind, the pride of Kentucky started toward Pennsylvania Avenue, while I
                  designed a brief stroll about the Capitol grounds for the quieter meditation upon
                  the great truths we had just heard. Plunged in a delicious reverie, I had but
                  commenced my walk, when sounds of loud cheering from the theatre of Impeachment
                  caused me to hastily enter that solemn temple and view the culminating
                  pageant.</p>
               <p>The HON. THADDEUS BINGHAM had just concluded his touching remarks detrimental to
                  the respondent. He had just finished his scathing exposure of an accidental
                  President whose lack of all decorum in public speaking has justly subjected him to
                  Impeachment by an outraged Congress; and the assembled populace were cheering the
                  consummate artist. Such disagreeable sounds, however, were unseemly in such a
                  place, inasmuch as they awoke thirteen aged Senators from much-needed slumber, and
                  jarred the spectacles from the noses of two venerable counsels for the
                  defence.</p>
               <p>The CHIEF JUSTICE tore off his night-cap and threw it at a deaf chap in the
                  gallery who had not heard the call for Silence, and was still stamping and
                  clapping horribly; and says he, "The police will please remove the galleries, as
                  it is impossible for the Senate to sleep amid such confusion."</p>
               <p>Thus, at the mandate of arbitrary power, we were all driven forth from our
                  dormitories into the pitiless air. Amongst the throng was the Mackerel Chaplain,
                  and says I to him,—</p>
               <p>"Who shall think, after such a popular ovation as this to a native orator, that
                  American eloquence is declining?"</p>
               <p>"MY good young friend," says the chaplain, shaking his head, "it will ever remain
                  a question in men's minds, whether the late applause was a tribute to native
                  eloquence, or a free people's irrepressible delight at the assured termination of
                  the last of the Impeachment Speeches."</p>

                  artistic resources of this distracted country, and contemplate the National
                  Academy of Design, the American Water-Color Society, and the House and Sign
                  Painters' Protective Union, we find ample encouragement for a hope that the
                  æsthetical future will develop some great native wizard of the ladder, pencil, and
                  brush, whose canvas shall worthily portray a few of the more awful and chaste
                  events of our intoxicated national history. Having paid twenty-five cents
                  admission fee to the old lady at the door, and taken checks for their canes from
                  the decayed artist's male orphan in the vestibule, our grandchildren will walk in
                  to survey the pictures after the manner of dispassionate critics. "Oh!"—they will
                  softly whisper to each other, as they stand affably before the paintings, and
                  assume that thoughtfully scowling expression of countenance which is equally
                  indicative of painters' colic, and a cultivated knowledge of the fine arts—"Oh!
                  how grand must these Impeachment scenes have been to those who beheld them in
                  reality! How much must they have reminded their living spectators of the sublime
                  Senatorial pageants of ancient Rome!" After saying which, and casually recognizing
                  a few spring bonnets of their acquaintance, our grandchildren will probably step
                  out together for a moment to obtain a glass of water and a clove for their
                  colds.</p>
               <p>The strict utilitarian will sneer at this artistic anticipation as the mere vision
                  of an enthusiast; the mere wild speculation of some dreamy worshipper of Titian
                  and Rubens, whose sanguine temperament has been unduly fired by an infatuated
                  adoration of the glorious frescoes upon the walls of the Capitol and the sides of
                  the East Broadway omnibuses. But I beg leave to make a pass at the strict
                  utilitarian with a broomstick, and calmly inform him, in the gossipy language of
                  the "Tribune," that he is a perjured traitor to Impeachment, a revolting object to
                  his constituents, and a source or permanent regret to his Maker. Upon a coarser
                  subject I should feel justified in using stronger terms; but art is still a
                  delicate exotic with us, and we must now attempt to dragoon its disbelievers into
                  unity with us by assailing them with violent abuse. I simply repeat, then, that
                  the strict utilitarian is an accursed renegade to all that preserves from the
                  loathing of his fellow-beings any person differing on any subject from myself.</p>
               <p>My belief in the exciting future of American Art is NOT<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000074"/> based upon the frescoes on the walls of the Capitol
                  and the sides of the New York omnibuses. No, sir! The members of Congress from my
                  State may unanimously call upon me to resign, or request me to refrain from
                  voting, but I must still adhere to my honest convictions. Great outside pressure
                  being brought to bear upon me, I may, indeed admit that I once noticed on the
                  interior panels of an Erie railroad-carriage a series of pink-and-blue Scriptural
                  paintings, which showed what native art may yet do toward preparing people's minds
                  for a roll down an embankment, and an accompanying fatal roast in a burning
                  sleeping-car. I may also admit, that much of the finer statuary in and around the
                  Capitol bids fair to find ample appreciation in every American household during
                  the coming years; mothers saying to their refractory children, "Don't cry now, my
                  dear, or the statue of Benjamin Franklin will come after you." "Go right to sleep,
                  like a good boy, Johnny, or the equestrian figure of General Jackson will catch
                  you." But more of these great works are responsible for my artistic faith in the
                  future.</p>
               <p>A true friend of mine (that is, one who tells me of my faults, and seems really to
                  regret that he has none of his own), who lives here in a frame house, got a young
                  artist acquaintance to do the front of his residence last week, and, as I watched
                  the progress of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chef d'œuvre,</foreign> I could not
                  but feel high hopes that the impressive splendors of Impeachment might indeed find
                  a worthy limner at last.</p>
               <p>Mounted on a ladder which was not more than twice tall enough for the edifice, and
                  armed with a brush not much larger than his head, the gifted young painter laid on
                  his touches with a boldness and breadth not always limited by the mere width of
                  the house. It must be admitted that he got nearly as much paint upon the ladder
                  and his own clothes as upon the residence, and that in reaching after some nice
                  effects of light and shade along the gutter-pipe, he produced quite a picturesque
                  and irregular white border on the edge of the red-brick house next door; but the
                  way that he threw chiaro oscuro into the shutters, and painted clean through a
                  pane of glass to the back of a rosewood chair standing inside, was enough to show
                  his genius. And then, when he finally descended to the sidewalk, which looked by
                  this time as though a violent snow-storm were stuck fast to it, and began
                  working-up the stoop in straw-color, I was amazed at the facility of this method.
                  Like other native artists, his drawing was not always exactly correct,—at times he
                  drew his brush so far over the edge that some of the straw-color ran down into the
                  area, and about a pint of it must have passed between the door and sill into the
                  hall,—yet his middle-distance was good, and the place where he rubbed off the
                  paint by sitting down on it to tie his shoe would not be noticed on a dark night.
                  Being no member of the pre-Raphaelite school, and scorning that mechanical
                  minuteness of petty detail which belongs rather to the photographer's drudge than
                  to the true artist, he neglected to paint behind a towel hanging from one of the
                  upper windows, and also left a few bare streaks up near<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000075"/> the eaves, but, then, to secure harmony of effect,
                  he painted the door-plate and door-knob with the greatest care.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon, my friend returned home from Impeachment, and, after slipping
                  down upon the white led on the sidewalk and getting his vest, coat, and hat
                  tastefully touched up with turpentine and straw-color, stared critically at the
                  great work.</p>
               <p>"Dear me," says he, with unreasonable hypercriticism, "isn't that place up there,
                  by the towel, a little too sketchy?"</p>
               <p>The sensitive young artist pushed him impatiently aside with his paint-brush, and
                  says he,—</p>
               <p>"Do you expect to examine a great painting by standing close enough to touch it
                  with your nose? Just step off to the proper distance,—a couple of blocks, say,—and
                  you'll see the difference."</p>
               <p>Mt friend retired a couple of blocks for the purpose; but quickly returned in
                  great agitation, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"From the distance the house doesn't look as though it had been painted at
                  all."</p>
               <p>"Exactly!" says the young artist, triumphantly. "The perfection of art is to
                  conceal art. I'll leave the ladder standing here five or six days, and send in my
                  bill immediately. "And he shook hands with us with the greatest good feeling, and
                  promptly retired with the pots to his Academy of Painting.</p>
               <p>His work, my boy, was a bold Sketch, a strong Study, rather than a
                  strictly-finished composition; and what I at first took for his signature in the
                  lower right-hand corner, has since proved to be the sign of a Dutch boot-maker
                  keeping shop in the basement; but the young artist is destined to rise (especially
                  when he has a ladder with him), and, as he is particularly noted for his
                  Varnishing also, we may well believe that the man destined to pictorialize
                  Impeachment for posterity is not far off. The man must be really great with
                  VARNISH, you see, or the sublime historical work may be regarded by posterity as
                  altogether too shallow-looking and crude to be tolerated by respectable
                  notice.</p>
               <p>As it is unquestionably a duty of the contemporaneous historian to give the future
                  artist certain vivid hints for his canvas, I take the liberty of insinuating that
                  last Monday and Tuesday afternoons offered fine opportunities for sketching, and
                  that some vigorous "whitewashing" was even attempted on the spot. Art, however,
                  has its separate departments; and if the inspired whitewasher shall also be
                  required to touch-up some of the principal figures in the great historical
                  Impeachment picture of the future, it is to be hoped that the gifted young painter
                  and varnisher will not grudge a reasonable share of the honors to his
                  brother-artist. Many of our very greatest public men are already known to prefer
                  whitewash to natural colors in such portraits of themselves as are taken for
                  posterity; and, aside even from the admitted necessity of this branch of art in
                  the depiction of such eminent historical personages, its practical encouragement
                  by all true philanthropists cannot<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7328-00000076"/> not
                  fail to aid notably in the elevation of the freed-negro race, many of whose
                  members are its ablest exponents.</p>
               <p>To both branches of art, then, I may intimate, that a picture representing a
                  massive lump of white sugar in an elevated background, and about ten thousand
                  agitated horseflies swarming at it in the force and middle ground, will convey a
                  reliable idea of the majestic Theatre of Impeachment on the afternoons I have
                  named. A general and particular understanding that the great final Transformation
                  Scene of the exciting play was to have a private rehearsal on Monday, preparatory
                  to its triumphant production at the Tuesday matinee, caused all the unemployed
                  persons in the United States to visit this city without further confusion; and, as
                  I looked down from my window at Willard's upon the dense throng of
                  amusement-seekers in the street, I could not help saying to myself, after the
                  manner of Xerxes,—</p>
               <p>"Of all these myriads, not one will be alive in a hundred years from now! None
                  live more than a hundred years, except revolutionary veterans and poll-parrots.
                  Even now, some five or six Senators are seriously sick from Impeachment Speeches.
                  The thought is melancholy, and I'll just step down to the bar-room and see if
                  there are any letters for me from Jamaica or Santa Cruz."</p>
               <p>But the surging through in the hallways caught me as I descended, and I was
                  summarily swept out-doors upon the Avenue, just in time to hear the remarks of the
                  venerable Miss P. Hen; who had arrived hastily from New York expressly to witness
                  the great Transformation Scene, and was waving her blue cotton umbrella in a
                  spirited harangue to the populace. Miss P. Hen is the author of the most reliable
                  History of the War ever delivered to subscribers at four dollars a volume, besides
                  being celebrated for bailing out the recent well-know Southern Confederacy; and
                  says she,—</p>
               <p>"The great Transformation Scene will satisfy everybody, and be universally
                  accepted by the press and public as the most splendid spectacle of the age. A.
                  Johnson is transformed into a private citizen; B. Wade is turned into the King of
                  Fairy-Land, and all the seven-thirties are changed into five-twenties. One of our
                  great machinists, named Trumbull, is probably the most ingenious man ever known,
                  and also deserves credit as the author of that immortal Civil Rights Act which
                  permits colored men to go behind the scenes and—"</p>
               <p>Here a well-informed chap came tearing frantically along from the majestic Theatre
                  of Impeachment, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"There's a hitch in the rehearsal of the Transformation Scene, my friends!
                  Trumbull refuses to perform; because, he says, that theatricals are immoral."</p>
               <p>Miss P. Hen made a pass at him with her blue cotton umbrella, and says she,—</p>
               <p>"As every enemy of decency and morality remarks, Trumbull is the most ingenious
                  man ever known; but outraged public sentiment points at him the withering finger
                  of scorn, and the coming ages shall regard him as a<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000077"/> noxious insect. Oh!" says Miss P. Hen, with wild
                  emotion, "I feel that I could tear his eyes out!"</p>
               <p>Turning sadly from sight of the gifted lady's tears, and edging slowly around a
                  group of solid Boston men, who were committing an assault with carpet-bags upon
                  another machinist, named Grimes, who was also suspected of having moral scruples
                  against the drama, I came suddenly upon that haughty Southerner, Loyola
                  Munchausen, who, in his surtout of French-Yoke Shirt, and Spring-overcoat of
                  Water-Proof Awning, was malevolently offering bets against the success of the
                  great Transformation Scene. He had left his organ and monkey at home in the
                  suburban hen-house where he now resides; but I noticed two or three new
                  business-cards pasted in the advertising panels of the half a boot-leg which he
                  wears as a dress-hat; and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Here you are, now, ten mortgages to five that the Transformation Scene don't
                  work. Here you are: first and second mortgages on improved Southern real-estate.
                  Ten to five that the great Transformation don't come off to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Before I could salute him, there was a fresh excitement right behind me, where the
                  irascible Miss P. Hen had 'lighted upon Fessenden, a third machinist, whose moral
                  compunctions would not allow him to take final part in the immoral drama, and was
                  indignantly beating him over the head with her blue cotton umbrella. "Oh!" says
                  she to him, "you nasty thing!" And she stuck the ferule of her umbrella into his
                  ear, and began spanking him with one of her shoes.<ref rend="super"

               <p>And when the memorable Tuesday came, and it was really announced to the vast
                  audience of the Impeachment matinee, that, in consequence of a defect in the
                  complicated machinery, the great Transformation Scene must be deferred until
                  Saturday, it actually seemed as though the dramatic public were bent upon having
                  the Scene, even though it were given separately as merely a Farce.</p>
               <p>Under the supervision of the incensed P. Hen, a public indignation meeting was

                  be adjudged guilty of corruption, tergiversation, and inexpressible iniquity.</p>

               <p>THE Human Mind!—what a marvellous, commonplace, firm, unstable possession it is!
                  The more we have of it to show, the greater is our envy of Shakespearian
                  Commentators, Native Dramatists, Congressmen, and others, who possess merely that
                  piece of mind which passeth show. Mine, my boy, is an inquiring mind,—that is to
                  say, it ventilates itself in quires,—and, having grown weary of those Impeachment

               <p>Peace, meek-eyed Peace, has cut its snowy pigeon-wings wings over the recent
                  Southern tracks of Federal carnage, and our beloved country reels more mighty and
                  prosperous from the late sanguinary affair than writhing Europe cares to admit.
                  How beautiful is the spectacle, as we view it through a piece of Smoked Glass! How
                  sublime a thing it is to see a million of strategic troops turning tranquilly from
                  the tented field, and selling Newtown pippins on the ferry-boats! How ennobling it
                  is to think that the very beings who were once brass-buttoned brigadiers, and
                  drank success to the good cause in many a fiercely-contested bottle, are now
                  applying in large numbers for admission to the bar kept by Themis!</p>
               <p>'Tis sweet, my native land, to behold thine exhibition of so much majestic shape
                  to the world; and all will ecstatically black thy boots, save affrighted Albion,
                  and that imperial Gaul whose not remote purchase of our iron-clad "Dunderberg"

               <p>Toning this sentiment to the more dulcet register of my fine organ(which I find to
                  be the name for "voice," in the admirable musical criticisms of all our excellent
                  morning journals), I expressed it to the Conservative Kentucky Chap, the other
                  day, in an ante-room of the White House, where we stood waiting our turn to take a
                  parting pardon with the Executive before departing on our several Government
                  salaries.</p>

                  Chap pulled on a pair of yellow kid gloves, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Tis sweet, indeed, to see our native land thus rising like a Felix from her
                  ashes, and causing all the iron-clads or nature to tremble horribly together at
                  Cherbourg and Spithead; but Kentucky far prefers the pageant of these
                  Confederacies, now forgiving their recent Vandal foes, and taking pardon at the
                  same table with him who was once their tailor."<ref rend="super"

               <p>Here the Conservative Kentucky Chap accepted an apology from the haughty
                  Virginian, who had accidentally knocked his hat over his eyes in an attempt to hit
                  an attempt to hit an adjacent crippled Hessian with his cane, and a hickory nut
                  from the lunch-basket of a female Confederacy in front of him.</p>
               <p>"Very true, my discriminating Von Bismarck," said I, sagely "and I doubt not the
                  forgiving nature of these sunny men expects to meet in return a disposition for
                  giving them—anything they ask!"</p>
               <p>"Hem!" says the Conservative Kentucky Chap, severely, as he moved hastily aside to
                  let a Confederacy of much collar get his shoes polished by a member of our
                  national conservative organization. "Hem!" says the Kentucky chap, "you possess a
                  radical soul, incapable of appreciating that noble sect of reconstructed planters
                  with whom Kentucky is connected by marriage."</p>
               <p>Cowering under his just rebuke, and thinking that, after all, I should be as well
                  without a pardon so late in the afternoon, I shook hands with him, and then
                  respectfully begged my way through all the Southern States to the front door, from
                  whence I sped to the railroad depot, where Captain Villiam Brown and the Conic<ref

               <p>We were going by rail ro reconstruct that sunflower of chivalry, Captain
                  Muchausen; and we took to him, as a Provisional Governor, his elder brother,
                  Loyola Muchausen, whose unflinching fidelity to the Union, in not taking arms for
                  the South while laid up with typhus fever and inflammatory rheumatism, had very
                  justly procured for him this appointment. It is by thus encouraging the loyal
                  element of sunny clime that we unite justice with magnanimity, and astonish
                  Professor Goldwin Smith, of Oxford.</p>
               <p>"Well, my wizard of the sword," said I to Villiam, as I espied that unpromoted
                  warrior on the platform of a car, giving directions as to the disposal of his
                  property to an attorney of his acquaintance, "is the Provisional aboard, and all
                  right for starting?"</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7328-00000080"/>
               <p>"Yes, my fren'," said Villiam, handing his watch to the attorney, and sadly
                  intimating that it was to be sent to his poor mother; "yes," says Villiam, "he's
                  holding his breath on a seat by himself, and trying to be cam."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said I, vainly endeavoring to appear unmoved, "where are we expected to have
                  our first engagement?"</p>
               <p>"Just below here, my fren'," says Villiam, cutting off a lock of his hair for the
                  attorney, "where a couple of rails are broken."</p>
               <p>Too much affected to say more, we went into the car reserved for officers and
                  civilians, and took a seat together, with our hands interclasped. Thus we sat;

               <p>O sudden Death! At any time thou seemest to us the most terrible of earthly ills,
                  save when Mr. Tupper brings out a new book; but how supernaturally malignant dost
                  thou appear when we have to buy the tickets for our<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000081"/> own funeral, and die standing on our heads between
                  two mutilated brakemen.</p>
               <p>"Hum!" says Villiam, thoughtfully, just as the train began to move; "are those the
                  marbles of my childhood which mine eyes behold?"</p>
               <p>I looked to the car floor, as he spoke, and beheld certain little figured glass
                  balls, as they appeared to be, rolling loosely around; but, upon picking one up, I
                  found it to be a human eye.</p>
               <p>"Conductor," said I, calmly as I could, to be being attached to his watch by a
                  large chain, who was waltzing solemnly down the aisle and doing the ticket
                  trick,—"conductor," said I, "what mean these?"</p>
               <p>"Why," says the conductor, pleasantly, "you see the cars haven't been swept out
                  since that last little affair we has with the night express from Pinchtown." Here
                  the affable conductor took up an eye, and says he, "If the crystal of that one
                  wasn't broken, it would make a neat scarf-pin!"</p>
               <p>Just at this moment, the engaging conductor quickly ascended to the top of the
                  car, and put his head through the ventilator, and all the gentlemen in the seats
                  adjacent joined me in sitting upon Captain Villiam Brown.</p>
               <p>For we had had a spirited skirmish with a milk train, and had killed two drovers
                  and a lozenge-boy.</p>
               <p>"You see," said the polite conductor, coming down, and continuing the
                  conversation, "when you have eyes only, you can't do much else than use them for
                  scarf-pins; but when you have a few good legs, five or six hands that have come
                  off clean, and as many tops of heads as would fill a small basket, the directors
                  let you sell them to the medical students, for the company, and pay a fair
                  commission to you."</p>
               <p>The really agreeable conductor now darted through the length of the car, and
                  placed his head through the top of the door, and four fat women and the
                  Provisional Governor went to bed upon Villiam and me.</p>
               <p>For we had had a sharp time on the right with a broken bridge, and wounded twelve
                  Mackerels and the baggagemaster.</p>
               <p>"It must be plain to everybody," observed the genial conductor, coming back with
                  his collar-bone broken, and resuming the interview, "that the leg and hand
                  business will hardly pay you sometimes; for I have known whole weeks to pass
                  without giving you anything more than a couple of dozen fingers, and a few
                  poorly-executed knee-pans, which don't pay you for taking them to the medical
                  college."</p>
               <p>It was at this moment that the amiable conductor went very swiftly and stood upon
                  his head behind the stove, and Villiam stretched himself at full length from a
                  pink bonnet to a large "chignon."</p>
               <p>For we had had a brilliant charge down a bank, and scalded three brakemen and a
                  conductor.</p>
               <p>"Some people might imagine," said the lively conductor not minding his broken
                  arms, and regaining the thread of his discourage, "that you might make something
                  out of the<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7328-00000082"/> feet and shoulder-blades you
                  sometimes get, but the feet are apt to be too much crushed to pay, and so many
                  shoulder-blades are brought to market from the Western trains, on which a great
                  many elderly maiden ladies travel, that they are perfect drug."</p>
               <p>Upon which the thoroughly fascinating conductor vanished magically behind the half
                  of the car-floor which arose between him and us, and Villiam and I retired over
                  the top of the water-cooler.</p>
               <p>For we had had a stirring affair with a broken tie, and rolled nine women and a
                  quarter-master into one vigntipede.</p>
               <p>Captain Villiam Brown removed the cover of the water-cooler from his head, where
                  it had rested like a helmet, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Who shall care for mother now?"</p>
               <p>"Cheer up, my blue and gold Achilles," said I, extricating my left thigh from the
                  side of the car, and noticing with satisfaction that we had just run over a cow
                  with safety; "cheer up, for we approach the place where awaits us the flower of
                  chivalry!"</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, taking his will from an inner pocket, and pinning it to his
                  coat collar, so that it might be easily seen by those who should find the upper
                  part of his body,—"ah!" says he, softly, "train up a man in the way he should go,
                  and he will not live to be old enough to depart from it. That is," says Villiam,
                  explainingly, "if the train is on a railroad appertaining to the United States of
                  America.'</p>
               <p>This sagacious remark of Villiam suggested to me that the "train up" in a man's
                  case, like the "train up" in a child's, not unfrequently owed its mishaps to a
                  misplaced switch; and I was about to convey the idea to Villiam, in the unstudied
                  phraseology of our more serious comic journals, when we both went up like rockets
                  into the air.</p>
               <p>For we had had something of a brush with the exploding boiler of the locomotive,
                  and had experienced what an ungrammatical person might denominate the last rose of
                  summer.</p>
               <p>"Hum!" says Villiam, from the top of a pine tree; "is this Chipmunk Court
                  House?"</p>
               <p>"It must be, my bird of Mars," murmured I, from the upper branches of a
                  horse-chestnut.</p>
               <p>Here a dreadful groan burst from Provisional Governor Munchausen, who was seated
                  on the chimney of a deserted house beside the track, and says he, "Do my
                  spectacles relate a falsehood, or is that really a human being up yonder?"</p>
               <p>It was the figure of the engaging conductor, impaled upon a lightning-rod
                  surmounting a lofty flag-staff, and striking feebly out with his hands and feet,
                  after the manner of a fly on a pin. As we gazed, there came down a soft voice of
                  solicitation, and is said, "Tick-ets!"</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, "his name is Tickets!"</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7328-00000083"/>
               <p>Here the friendly conductor wiggled impatiently, and held down a hand toward us,
                  and says he,—</p>
               <p>"TICK-ETS!"</p>
               <p>After which, he immediately folded up, and we felt that his spirit had fled to its
                  native depot.</p>
               <p>Luckily for us, my boy, Captain Munchausen now arrived at the scene, from his
                  native palace, to pick out a few remains of such friends as might have come on the
                  train; and as we came down the trees, and noticed nearly all the Conic Section
                  coming down from other trees around, he nodded the woollen stocking which served
                  him as a cap, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Having been overpowered by superior numbers, I am prepared to be reconstructed,
                  and accept the temporary protection of your armed ruffians."</p>
               <p>Villiam endeavored to draw his good sword, Escalibar; but, finding that
                  exquisitely tempered weapon too much bent to come out of the scabbard, he
                  remembered the terrifying effect of the word "Sirrah!" as found in all our
                  absorbing weekly journals of aristocratic romance, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Peace, sarah!"</p>
               <p>Captain Munchausen superciliously thrust his hands into his pockets, quite
                  forgetful that all his knuckles came visibly through in front, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Let the Union meeting proceed to organize, after the wishes of our noble
                  President."</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Provisional Governor at once mounted an inverted pail, and addressed
                  the vast assemblage in the following speech,—</p>
               <p>"FELLOW-CITIZENS OF ACCOMAC,—Four years of heroic war and glorious self-sacrifice,
                  for a wicked cause still dear to every freeman's heart, having failed for the
                  present to attain our independence, let us rejoice at the restoration of the
                  beloved old Union, under our noble President, and return to it full of forgiveness
                  for the present!"</p>
               <p>Here the meeting was for a moment disturbed, by Captain Munchausen's involuntary
                  discharge of a pistol at a Mackerel corporal, who was accidentally looking at him
                  like a conqueror; but order was quickly restored, by the arrest of the soldier, on
                  a charge of stealing glances, and the meeting went on.</p>
               <p>"I am appointed Provisional Governor, to secure your forgiveness by means of
                  provisions; and while I would earnestly entreat you, fellow-citizens, never to
                  cease cherishing the glory of that greatest and purest of patriots, Mr. Jefferson
                  Davis, I would also implore you to stand by our noble President in his struggle
                  with the reptiles of the North!"</p>
               <p>Captain Munchausen merely turned away for a moment, to make a kick at a mackerel
                  passing by, and then says he,—</p>
               <p>"The sunny South will receive you again as equals! Follow me with your vampyres to
                  my chateau!"</p>
               <p>As we followed him, through the shades of evening, I noticed that Captain Villiam
                  Brown was deeply moved.</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7328-00000084"/>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, profoundly, "the sunny South is like the feather-bed of my
                  early years, and grows larger from being well beaten."</p>
               <p>And like woman, who is never farther from her conqueror's feet than when she
                  yields to his arms!</p>

               </opener>
               <p>HOW exquisite a creation is woman, as she evokes the soothing melody of home from
                  a seven-octave piano, and warbles the anguish of Italy in a manner to reach the
                  ears of Garibaldi! How like a fairy of patient tenderness and love is she to the
                  little spanklings of the tranquil house, as she fondly confides them to the care
                  of her sweeping mother, while she goes out to do a little shopping; or
                  thoughtfully persuades them from the apartment when one calls whose misery as to
                  what to do with his hat and legs might overtask their delicate young nerves! How
                  softly creak her ministering steps in the sick-room, as she goes every three
                  minutes to see what time it is getting to be, and seldom upsets more than two
                  chairs and the tray of breakfast things on each chronological occasion! How like a
                  soothing vision from some better world is she to her careworn husband, when she
                  acutely sympathizes in all his troubles by having the sick-headache as soon as he
                  commences telling them to her, and ardently shares in all his joys at the exact
                  moment when they take the shape of an<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7328-00000085"/>
                  invitation to the opera! And then, when adversity comes down upon him to whom she
                  has sworn to send all her bills, and he finds it difficult to buy that daily cheap
                  cigar which he feels compelled as a gentleman to purchase at the gratuitous
                  lunch-saloon where he is inexpensively dines, how touching is it to see her so
                  willingly practising all the rigors of economy,—to see her giving only four
                  dollars for a "braid," when she might get one for four and a quarter and
                  contenting herself with three pounds of "mixed" candies, when French assorted
                  fruit-drops are so much higher!</p>
               <p>The arrival of Matilda Munchausen at the chateau of her brother is the event
                  leading me into this train of thoughts; and when I remember how this fair girl
                  freely offered a pair of ear-rings to be melted into canon for the South, and went
                  with her own feet to carry a pair of embroidered lamp-mats to a sick Confederacy
                  in the hospital, I feel that my eyes, in dying, could not rest upon anything more
                  beautiful and appropriate than a woman's hand presenting me with a crochet
                  smoking-cap.</p>
               <p>At the commencement of the recent misunderstanding between the sections, Matilda
                  fled from the chateau to Wilmington, where news of the latest fashions was likely
                  to be soonest heard; and at the period when the prospects of the South seemed
                  darkest, wrote to her brothers that the Elliptic Hoop-skirt was the best. And now,
                  that Reconstruction has set in, and edging is no dearer in Wilmington than it is
                  anywhere else, she has returned hastily to the halls of her fathers to get her
                  back-hair reconstructed.</p>
               <p>Captain Villiam Brown and I had just returned from reproving two Mackerels, who
                  had been scalded with hot tea by order of the Provisional Governor for looking at
                  the surrounding country like conquerors, as it were,—we had just returned from
                  this mission of duty, when Matilda Munchausen arrived and asked if anybody had
                  called during the last six years.</p>
               <p>"Matilda," said Captain Munchausen, impressively, as he retied the bit of twine
                  which held his vest together in front, "the two blue Vandals before you, trimmed
                  with brass buttons, are—ha! ha!—our Conquerors; and you must not spit on them for
                  the present. Miss Munchausen, Vandals; Vandals, Miss Munchausen."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, bowing as one who should look for a pin upon the floor, and
                  recovering himself just in time to save a small black bottle from sliding out of
                  his pocket, "we are Vandals only in our extreme willingness to take a Roam with
                  you."</p>
               <p>"And," said I, bowing also, "you are yourself fair enough to make each of us a
                  Cinna."</p>
               <p>"Sirs," said Matilda, haughtily, "while you are guests at my brother's chateau,
                  and have your minions on the grass-plat, which is a burning shame, I shall not
                  wear my hair in papers. But you must not bring any of your conquering airs here,
                  and I won't have you looking at my back-hair as if it was anything to be ashamed
                  of because<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7328-00000086"/> it isn't fixed ex-act-ly
                  like the latest style in New York. Oh!" said Matilda, with energy, "I should like
                  to scratch your eyes out!"</p>
               <p>"Matilda! Matilda!" said Captain Munchausen, gloomily.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Sarah," says Villiam, affably, "my fren' and I understand the fair
                  seck. Ah!" says Villiam, in soft ecstasy, "how like a bounding fawn would that
                  lovely face appear in a new style of spring bonnet which mine eyes beheld of late
                  in Washington! It was," says Villiam, dreamily, "a teaspoonful of lace, seasoned
                  with fine golddust, and garnished with raw tummattusses and green——."</p>
               <p>It was a shame that the Provisional Governor interrupted him just then; for her
                  beautiful head was thrown eagerly forward, her eyes were all alight with the
                  radiance of excitement, and her just-parted lips, like a cleft-rose, seemed to
                  exhale the fragrance of sweet thoughts.</p>
               <p>"The South, visionary satrap,"—said the Provisional Governor, taking off his
                  spectacles to cool them in consequence of his eyes having flashed with
                  indignation,—"the South, visionary satrap, refuses to buy the luxuries of the
                  North, having learned that six months' credit is to be refused with contumely.
                  Now, let us to crockay."</p>
               <p>We all followed his lead out doors to the croquet ground, our host having
                  enthusiastically adopted the game, upon information that it was fashionable in
                  Europe, from a cousin who sold lozenges on the Continent. Gaining the spot, and
                  looking down upon the half-hoops sticking into the ground, I was about to speak,
                  when Villiam suddenly gave a start, and I saw Matilda flitting hastily from his
                  side.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam.</p>
               <p>"How now, my Napoleon?" asked I.</p>
               <p>"My fren'," says Villiam, in a whisper, "that sweet being pinched me."</p>
               <p>"What for?" said I.</p>
               <p>"Hum!" says Villiam, rubbing his arm, "methinks she loves me; and she's winkin' at
                  me now."</p>
               <p>Alas! for the quick susceptibility of woman's heart! Matilda was indeed winking
                  and motioning in an extraordinary manner just at that instant, and seemed anxious
                  to remind the man of her choice that the terrible fact of their long and secret
                  attachment must on no account be divulged to her brothers. Thus it is that young
                  Love, when first an occupant of woman's nature—bold, yet timid—is ever making an
                  arrow escape!</p>
               <p>The mallets with which the game of croquet is played not having arrived from
                  Europe, we were supplied instead with shovels, marked "U. S.;" and as the
                  requisite balls were not found in the barrels from whence the half-hoops were
                  ingeniously extracted, we used apples in their places.</p>
               <p>With much chivalry of manner did the dignified Munchausen advance with his shovel
                  and strike an apple through half the hoops, closely followed by Matilda
                  Munchausen, who beckoned Villiam to follow her and struck her apple with still
                  better effect. Villiam, with a heavenly smile upon his countenance, attended to
                  his fruit with equal skill,<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7328-00000087"/> and the
                  Provisional Governor and I came after in a state of feverish excitement. Wildly
                  raged the manly sport, and all the apples were close together near the last
                  wicket, when there suddenly appeared upon the scene a ravenous pig, of severe
                  visage, who incontinently devoured them in a twinkling of the eye.</p>
               <p>"By chivalry!" exclaimed Captain Munchausen, "he's eaten up all the crockay."</p>
               <p>"Well, I declare!" said Matilda Munchausen, "to have all spoiled by a pig!"</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, softly, "be not offended with the accident, sweet warbler. Is
                  not a pig," says Villiam, tenderly, "like a bride, when he plights his troth?"</p>
               <p>The noble girl seemed not to hear this beautiful idea; for she looked quickly
                  around to be sure that her brothers were not looking, and then, grasping his
                  nearest hand, she murmured, earnestly,—</p>
               <p>"You will not disappoint me?"</p>
               <p>"Never!" says Villiam, with dreadful intensity.</p>
               <p>She put her face nearer to his, and hissed,—</p>
               <p>"Couldn't you put it in a letter?"</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiams, beginning to dance ecstatically, "let me put it upon that
                  lovely brow."</p>
               <p>"You are kyind, very kyind, sir," whispered the maiden, hurriedly, "but it would
                  not be right to accept such a thing from a stranger."</p>
               <p>"Hum!" says Villiam, musingly, "wilt meet me this evening by moonlight alone in
                  the back kitchen?"</p>
               <p>"Will you tell me all, then?" asked, eagerly.</p>
               <p>Villiam nodded after the manner of an incorrigible Byron.</p>
               <p>"Then I will be there," said Matilda; and flew to regain her brothers who were
                  already walking on.</p>
               <p>From that moment, until nightfall, Captain Villiam Brown spake never a word; but I
                  saw that he was steadily growing more depressed, and once or twice I caught him
                  contemplating, with suppressed sighs, a photograph of his mother. Oh, how
                  beautiful is that attribute of our common nature which, at any age, makes our
                  thoughts revert to "Mother" at the approach of a great danger! Even the old man,
                  on the verge of bankruptcy, has been heard to refer respectfully to his mother as
                  one who always cheerfully predicted that he would yet come to want, because, as a
                  boy, he had refused to eat crust; and the young man, whether in a storm at sea, or
                  threatened with marriage, equally regrets having left that mother's side.</p>
               <p>As the stars commenced to appear, I walked out with Villiam, and endeavored to
                  calm his natural fears. I told him, that if he felt really unable to purchase one
                  new bonnet, three pairs of balmorals, six lace handkerchiefs and four pairs of
                  gloves per month, it was his duty to avoid making any proposals; but that he must
                  seize her arm the moment she drew a pistol, and trust me to come to his assistance
                  with two muskets from behind the mangle.</p>
               <p>"My fren'," says Villiam, with deep emotion, "would<pb n="170 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000088"/> you have me rooflessly destroy all that young
                  beings vision of going to the milliner's and pricing expensive silks all the way
                  down Broadway? No!" says Villiam, sternly, "I will not blight her young life thus,
                  even with silk at its present exciting prices."</p>
               <p>Not having it in my heart to protest further against the sweet romance of two fond
                  hearts, I silently armed myself with two muskets from the Mackerel camp on the
                  lawn, and hastened in advance to conceal myself behind the mangle in the back
                  kitchen.</p>
               <p>Soon Matilda Munchausen entered by one door, with a lighted candle in her hand,
                  and Villiam came through another with feeble steps.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said Matilda Munchausen, "our seneschal, who is just outside the door in
                  the hall, must not be kept waiting too long before locking up the chateau for the
                  night; and so you will please be brief; but, at the same time, I must know all,
                  and I will see if I have enough money."</p>
               <p>"Money!" says Villiam, going down upon his knees; "don't think money will buy what
                  I could give thee freely!"</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, sir, to find you so intoxicated that you cannot stand on your feet,"
                  returned the maiden; "and perhaps you can tell me better at another time."</p>
               <p>"Madam," says Villiam, rising with dignity to his feet again, "I had reason to
                  suppose that you were interested in some remarks I made to-day."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I was," said Matilda.</p>

                  telling you all?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!" ejaculated the now agitated Matilda Munchausen, "and now tell me, how
                  was it trimmed?"</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, "how was who trimmed?"</p>
               <p>Miss Munchausen ate a peppermint drop as she sat on the refrigerator, and says
                  she,—</p>
               <p>"Why, the bonnet of course. That bonnet you commenced telling about this
                  morning."</p>
               <p>Villiam slapped his left leg with tremendous vehemence, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Come out with the muskets, my fren', and behold the wreck of what was once a
                  man."</p>
               <p>As I appeared from behind the mangle, Matilda fled from the kitchen with
                  precipitation, and the seneschal and I stood alone with him.</p>
               <p>"Well, my Marshal Ney," said I, pleasantly, "how was it trimmed?"</p>
               <p>"With '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Illusion,</foreign>' my fren'," says Villiam,
                  sadly; "with '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Illusion.</foreign>'"</p>
               <p>Better was it thus for him, my boy, than if he had really fallen a matrimonial

                  anticipation, is promise of breeches.</p>

               <p>TO the man of limited salary and a religious turn of mind, nothing is more
                  revolting than the presumptuous pride and four-horse turnout of a wealthy person.
                  The man of limited salary and a religious turn of mind, who takes his cheap but
                  happy ride to Central Park in a horse-car, pauses for a moment at the Fifth-Avenue
                  entrance of that park to scratch himself; and, as the sinful vehicles of the rich
                  roll by him, he softly murmurs, "Give me my horse-car and a clear conscience,
                  rather than a basket-phaeton and a soul guilty of wealth. My horse-car may not be
                  inclosed with plate-glass," says he, cheerily, wiping the dust out of his ears;
                  "it may not be devoted to myself alone," says he, scraping the mud from his knees
                  where an Irish-woman's baby had stood upon them during the trip; "but it brings
                  one here as safely as though it were a chariot. Roll on, then, ye hapless children
                  of mammon, in your shining carriages. I ask none of your gold to make me the more
                  virtuous as a man, or the more justly celebrated as an umbrella-maker."</p>
               <p>And what, after all, is this wealth, that its possession should bring pride, its
                  loss despair? Its sudden withdrawal in consequence of a Vandal war of emancipation
                  may, indeed, oblige men of imperious natures to go around in straw hats made of
                  the bottoms of baskets, and collars composed of wall-paper; it may compel them to
                  dine and attend church in dressing-gowns made of old window-curtains; but it
                  cannot crush the indomitable souls long accustomed to implicit obedience from
                  persons of African descent; nor humiliate the chivalric minds to which everything
                  from the North, save six months' credit, has always been inexpressibly
                  disgusting.</p>
               <p>Imagine yourself here beside me, my boy, at Chipmunk Court House, gazing at the
                  patrimonial chateau of the Munchausens, with four mortgages upon it, and a
                  Dutch-oven sticking out of the side. Has it any less dignity to the sight as the
                  castle of an ancient and knightly race, merely because a temporary
                  misunderstanding with the Rothschilds impels its owner to wear a woollen stocking
                  for a smoking-cap, and a pair of his deceased wife's hose for gloves? Does it loom
                  less princely upon the vision as a stately Southern home, merely because a few of
                  the shingles have fallen from the ramparts, and one of the towers closely
                  resembles a chimney with all the top bricks blown off? You dare not answer in the
                  affirmative. You dare not believe that a temporary misunderstanding with the
                  Rothschilds is any derogation<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7328-00000091"/> gation
                  from the native dignity of men who are strangers to fear and a fear to
                  strangers.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday morning, while Captain Villiam Brown was shaving himself, in his own
                  room, with the bit of window-glass which our host had lent him for the purpose,
                  and I was seated in my own chamber, upon an old wagon-seat, which served as a
                  sofa, there entered unto me Loyola Munchausen; who, with his usual haughty air,
                  threw himself upon the inverted butter-tub which represented a chair in the suite
                  of Southern cottage furniture.</p>
               <p>"I greet your highness," said I, rising, and pretending a delicate blindness to
                  the fact that the pocket-handkerchief fluttering in his right hand had undoubtedly
                  been manufactured from a discarded night-cap. "I greet your Highness. To what an I
                  indebted for your worshipful company this morning?"</p>
               <p>"Sir," said he, loftily, "I can no longer refrain from noticing that you have
                  brought a carpet-bag with you to the South."<ref rend="super" target="#note_027"
                     xml:id="return_027">*</ref>

               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_027">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_027">*</ref>"Carpet-baggers" is one of the affectionate titles given to Northern
                     visitors by Southern sarcastic journals.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"I cannot deny it," said I, coloring with shame.</p>
               <p>"Then, sir," added the imperious Southerner, leaning heavily upon the reversed
                  barrel which served as the toilet-table of the cottage suite, "let me warn you
                  against making that carpet-bag too conspicuous while you remain in the chateau of
                  my knightly brother, Captain tain Munchausen. The sunny South," says he hotly,
                  "has used no carpet-bags herself since the late Vandal war, and the sight of one
                  in the hands of a Northern Hessian is an insult to her during the present coolness
                  between herself and the Rothschilds."</p>
               <p>"Oh," said I, calmly, "I understand you now. The sight of a mudsill carpet-bagger
                  from the Yankee North is an aggravation to the sunny South, because she herself
                  has at present nothing whatever to put into a carpet-bag!"</p>
               <p>"Sir," said Loyola Munchausen, rising to his feet again that I might not too
                  closely observe the pair of india-rubbers which he wore as slippers, "you are
                  right. Your military Vandals may have—ha! ha!—conquered the sunny South for a
                  time, and rendered it temporarily difficult for her to pay the interest upon all
                  her mortgages; but she is still too proud to bear the insolence of carpet-baggers
                  in silence."</p>
               <p>Pausing for suitable words whereby to confess my own iniquity in possessing any
                  baggage, and my deep sympathy with one of the most sensitive peoples that ever had
                  a trifling difference with the Rothschilds, I was abruptly startled by a
                  tremendous clangor which seemed to come from some point over our heads.</p>
               <p>"Dear me!" says I, agitatedly, "is somebody cleaning a brass kettle on the roof;
                  or has the cat got a fit amongst the milk-pans?"</p>
               <p>"No, poor Vandal," says Loyola Munchausen, moving<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000092"/> haughtily to the nearest window, and swiftly
                  pulling aside the split coffee-bag which represented its damask curtains; "that is
                  the great bell of the chateau; and it is ringing in honor of the arival of
                  Pendragon Penruthers, Esquire, of Taikachor Court House, who comes in state to sue
                  for the hand of our fair sister, Matilda Munchausen."</p>
               <p>The original great bell of the Munchausen chateau, after having called the family
                  to dinner for ages, had been freely melted into cannon during the recent Vandal
                  carnage; but its place was now amply supplied by a large tin dish-pan, in which
                  swung a pewter spoon on a wire; and, as it gave forth its peal of welcome, and I
                  thrust my head through the window to behold the pageant, Captain Villiam Brown's
                  intellectual countenance also appeared from a neighboring casement.</p>
               <p>"My fren'," says Villiam, perceptibly trembling, "has a junk-shop exploded
                  anywhere? What is this horrible noise which mine ears behold?"</p>
               <p>I told him. in hurried accents, that the great bell was ringing in honor of the
                  Chevalier P. Penruthers, who came from his own baronial halls at Taikachor Court
                  House to demand the land of Lady Matilda Munchausen in marriage; and when I
                  noticed what a keen expression of pain usurped those particular portions of his
                  countenance where he had cut himself while shaving with the Munchausen family
                  razor, I remembered that he himself had once cast fond eyes upon the heiress.
                  Deeply affected by the thought, I turned my bit of Smoked Glass to the road below,
                  and there beheld a stately sight.</p>
               <p>Mounted upon a spirited snuff-colored barb, whose knee joints had been finely
                  developed by the equestrian sports of the canal tow-path, was Pendragon
                  Penruthers, Esquire. Attired in white kid gloves, a green bombazine overcoat, red
                  flannel inexpressibles, and a unique, tall, square paper hat, marked "7 lbs. BEST
                  JAVA COFFEE," he recalled to mind all that I have ever read of chivalrous
                  knighthood, and suggested some of the finest knightly portraitures of Sir Walter
                  Scott. At the grand gate, a few slats at the bottom of which had been fractured
                  the night before by the violent entrance of several pigs into the garden, stood
                  that mirror of chivalry, Captain Munchausen, neatly wrapped in his
                  window-curtain.</p>
               <p>P. Penruthers wound a shrill blast upon the tin horn which he carried as a bugle,
                  and I regret to say that my friend, Villiam, entirely misconstrued the knightly
                  summons.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, "that means fresh fish. Got any porgies?" cries Villiam, in a
                  pleasing voice.</p>
               <p>"Hush!" says I, greatly mortified, that is not a fish-horn. He winds his bugle as
                  a summons. Be silent, and mark what follows." Captain Munchausen raised his right
                  hand to the woollen stocking on his head, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Methinks, by our lady, thou blowest a keen blast, Sir Knight. Upon what high
                  embassy comest thou to our ancient chateau?"</p>
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7328-00000093"/>
               <p>Pendragon Penruthers, Esquire, did not dare bow in return, lest the motion should
                  overthrow his steed, which was at that moment standing weakly upon three legs, and
                  trying to scratch himself with the other; but he waved the clothes-pole, which he
                  carried as a lance, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"I come, sire, to lay my hand and heart, not to mention mortgages, at the feet of
                  the Lady Matilda Munchausen; and to offer knightly gauge to any losel knight who
                  would say me nay. Give her to me, sire, that my home in the Almshouse may be
                  lonely no more."</p>
               <p>"Sir Knight," responded Captain Munchausen, with emotion, "I know you for a member
                  of an old and heavily mortgaged race. Let us break bread together before entering
                  my halls. What, ho, seneschal!"</p>
               <p>Here the aged colored seneschal of the chateau made his appearance, bearing a
                  fresh hoe-cake on a dust-pan, and of this the two knights ate in token of amity.
                  At the conclusion of the ceremonial, Captain Munchausen motioned for his noble
                  guest to descend from his fiery charger, and leave the latter leaning up against
                  the fence; and says he,—</p>
               <p>"By my halidome, Sir Knight, you will find our ancient grass-plot occupied by a
                  horde of military Vandals from the plebeian North, who are sent to reconstruct us;
                  and the chateau is also defiled by the presence of two Yankee scorpions, who must
                  also be endured for a time."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Penruthers scowled fiercely, and says he, "Do they bring any capital with
                  them, sire?"</p>
               <p>"One of them, at least, has a carpet-bag," returned Captain Munchausen,
                  gloomily.</p>
               <p>P. Penruthers laughed a low, blood-curdling laugh, and he hissed through his set
                  teeth,—</p>
               <p>"Then I may once more know what it is to wear a clean collar. Let us within."</p>
               <p>As they passed in under the massive doorway, which would have been severely Gothic
                  but for the three or four emaciated hens roosting on top of it, I turned to
                  Villiam, and says I,—</p>
               <p>"Well, my fellow-scorpion, what think you now of the manners and customs of the
                  superior race?"</p>
               <p>Villiam thoughtfully brushed away an excited hen, which was striving to alight
                  upon his head, under the impression that his hair was something to eat, and says
                  he,—</p>
               <p>"My fren', if Matilda Munchausen leads that nobleman to the altar, she'll find him
                  the heaviest mortgage you ever heard of." After which malignant expression of
                  disappointed affection, Villiam passionately withdrew from public notice, and
                  resumed his toilet before the bottom of a tin pail which had been placed in his
                  apartment as a mirror.</p>
               <p>In about half an hour thereafter, the great bell of the chateau, which had been
                  removed downstairs, rang hideously for dinner; and my friend and I repaired at
                  once to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">salle à manger</foreign>, where we were
                  introduced as Vandals to the knight from Taikachor Court House.</p>
               <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7328-00000094"/>
               <p>Then, having taken seats on the inverted peach-baskets around the sumptuous table,
                  and noticed that the missing leg of the latter had been replaced temporarily by an
                  umbrella, we proceeded to discuss all the latest delicacies of the markets.
                  Pendragon Penruthers, Esq., passed a tin plate marked "U. S." to Villiam, and says
                  he,—</p>
               <p>"Sir Vandal, permit me to help thee to some hoecake! and would, by'r lady, it
                  might poison thee!" And, simultaneously, he leaned across the groaning board, and
                  took off my friend's clean collar.</p>
               <p>"Hum!" says Villiam, throwing at him a cracker marked "U. S."; "if you do that
                  again, my fren', I shall feel obliged to impeach you in the eye."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" says Matilda Munchausen, sticking a fork into me, "how disgusting it is to
                  have Northern reptiles at the same table with one!"</p>
               <p>At this crisis, Loyola Munchausen made a pass at Villiam with the wash-hand basin,
                  which served as a bread-tray, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"If you can't conduct yourself properly at our wassail-board, Sir Vandal, it will
                  be my painful duty, as a Provisional Governor, to fine you a couple of
                  dollars."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, cracking him on the head with the toasting-fork, "we don't
                  wish to alienate the Southern Union element; but if you try to pour anything out
                  of that teapot upon me, my fren', I'll call in my forces."</p>
               <p>Here a lamentable outcry came through the windows from the direction of the
                  grass-plot, and says I,—</p>
               <p>"What means this?"</p>
               <p>"It means, Sir Yankee," says Captain Munchausen, "that I have caused my seneschal
                  to pour some scalding water from the ramparts upon your Vandals out there, in
                  punishment for their having dared to look at our guest like conquerors."</p>
               <p>Merely pausing long enough to hurl at him one of the halves of dice-boxes which
                  served us as napkin-rings, Villiam flew from the feast to look after his scalded
                  Mackerels; and I immediately followed him, with one of Matilda Munchausen's
                  potatoes plastered against the back of my head.</p>
               <p>My friend was condoling with one of our scorched military Vandals on the lawn,
                  when I reached him, and says I,—</p>
               <p>"Are you going back again, Villiam?"</p>
               <p>He shook his head sadly, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"No, my fren'. It's dangerous for Northern Capital to dine with so many mortgages.
                  Let us wait and take our dinner with the seneschal."</p>

                  <dateline>CHIPMUNK COURT HOUSE, May 28, 1868.</dateline>
               </opener>
               <p>DURING the late violent proceedings of the United States of America against the
                  well known Southern Confederacy, our shameless military Vandals applied the torch
                  of the incendiary to all the fine wooden public buildings of Chipmunk Court House;
                  and I regret to say, my boy,—I mourn to observe,—that they attempted to justify
                  this wanton act, upon the ground that venerable female Confederacy had indignantly
                  protruded her spectacles from a second-story window while the troops were passing,
                  and hurled a hot rice-pudding at the principal brigadier. Taking advantage of the
                  temporary demoralization produced in the ranks by this dreadful episode, she had
                  also opened a scathing fire of saucepans and flat-irons upon the general army,
                  which so excited the head of the garrison that he at once scraped the pudding out
                  of his whiskers, removed the pudding-dish from his head, and ordered a speedy
                  ignition of the Slave Pen, the Whipping-post and other public edifices. Owing to
                  the fact that the local Fire Department was quite intoxicated at the time, and was
                  advised by his physician to bandage his head with a wet towel before trying to
                  remember where he had left his watering-pot, the flames spread fiercely to the
                  post-office, and destroyed the latter before a single lottery-circular could be
                  got out. Consequently, the present post-office consist of a former apple-stand
                  with a green cotton umbrella spread over it; and thither I repaired from the
                  chateau of the Munchausens, at an early hour this morning to ask for my mail.</p>
               <p>Donning the bottoms of two cologne-water bottles connected by a wire, which served
                  him as spectacles, the aged postmaster searched the blue worsted stocking, which
                  he used as a mail-bag, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"'Pears to me I did have a letter to your address; but I don't seem to remember
                  where it is. I haven't shaved lately," says he, meditatively,—"I haven't shaved
                  lately; so I couldn't have used it in that way; and we haven't lit a fire
                  recently; so it can't have been burnt. O—h—," says he, suddenly brightening up, "I
                  remember now. I let my wife have it last night, to take off the stove-lids with;
                  just wait a minute, until I step to the house and look in the coal-scuttle."</p>
               <p>Requesting me to mind the worsted stocking while he was gone, and see that no one
                  rifled the mail, the venerable postal official placed upon his head the scooped
                  rind of a watermelon, serving as his hat, and retired to the large<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000096"/> sugar-hogshead which he used as a family villa.
                  Presently, emerging from thence, with a gratified smile upon his countenance, he
                  briskly handed me what I at first took for a crumpled piece of leather, but
                  quickly found to be an envolope, scorched almost to a cinder.</p>
               <p>"Upon my word," says I, dispiritedly, "this is a nice-looking letter to get from a
                  friend. It may not have been inspired by 'thoughts that breathe;' but it looks as
                  though it certainly contained 'words that burn.'"</p>
               <p>The postmaster came flying out at me with a billet of firewood in his hand, and,
                  says he,—"See here, young man, if you're going to talk sarcastically about the
                  postal branch of the government, I shall have to chastise you for disloyalty. I've
                  tried to make this matter pleasant to you," says he, parentally. "I've tried to
                  get along with you without using passionate language; but you don't seem to know
                  what gratitude means. White paper is very dear just now at the South," says he,
                  explainingly; "and every day, when our oldest families around here want something
                  to wrap a pound of butter in, or to put in the bottom of a cake-pan, or to past
                  over a broken window, they send to me, and I let them have the letters directed
                  here to men from the Vandal North. Only yesterday," says he, with an injured look,
                  "one of our first ladies came to me for some waste-paper to do up her curls with
                  and, instead of handing her your letter, I gave her a despatch directed to a
                  military Yankee scorpion named Villiam Brown, Eskevire."</p>
               <p>"What!" says I, hotly. "Do you dare to violate private correspondence in this free
                  country?"</p>
               <p>He smiled a horrible smile, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Your own Congress, young man, has just decided that an official of the United
                  States of America has a right to do as he pleases with all private correspondence
                  whatsoever; and I shall look into the next letter that comes here for you, to see
                  what you do with all your money. And now," says he, passionately, making a pass at
                  me with the billed of firewood, "if you don't go away, and stop disturbing the
                  business of this office, I'll commit you for contempt of court."</p>
               <p>I remembered, then, that our able and investigating Congress had, indeed, asserted
                  the right to examine everybody's private telegraphic despatches, for the purpose
                  of obtaining accurate information as to the family-matters of those members of
                  their theatrical company who, at the last moment, had seceded from Impeachment
                  upon the plea that it was an immortal drama. I realized how umpleasant it must be
                  for some private gentlemen who had telegraphed a profane response to his
                  mother-in-law's seventy-fifth unprepaid lightning request that he would be sure
                  and be careful about her daughter's cold, to have his despatch publicly discussed
                  in legislative halls as having some probable occult bearing upon Impeachment; and
                  I wished that Congress Hadn't!"<ref rend="super" target="#note_028"
                     xml:id="return_028">*</ref>

               <p>Thoughtfully rubbing my head in the place where I had been struck by the billet of
                  firewood, I retreated with great humility to my apartment in the chateau, and
                  there succeed in extricating my scorched missive from the ashes of its envelop. It
                  was from the Conservative Kentucky Chap, at the Capital, and read thus: "Kentucky
                  has enjoyed herself very much to-day, and will be grossly inebriated this evening.
                  The great Transformation Scene, with which the drama concludes, failed, finally,
                  to work. Don't write or telegraph to any of your female acquaintances for a week;
                  or all your letters and telegrams will be read aloud in Congress, and published in
                  every one of the excellent morning journals, as having aided to corrupt Fessenden
                  and Grimes. Don't send any money to your mother-in-law by mail for a week, or it
                  will be taken out to pay for Impeachment. Weed the nobs and bone the swag."</p>
               <p>When a country has become so demoralized, my boy, that a chap of good family and
                  elegant language, like myself, can be familiarly addressed in that way, just as
                  though he were a President and entitled to no respect, it is high time for some
                  sort of change. Not wishing to conceal anything from those members of Congress who
                  have a right to know all about the letters we receive, I may as well observe that
                  "Weed the nobs and bone the swag" means, literally, "Equivocate, like any
                  commercial advertiser, with the nabobs around you, and get them to bet with you."
                  Such counsel I treat with contempt; and, as I am a happy and unmarried man, I
                  have, of course, no mother-in-law to support. As for my letters to female
                  acquaintances, I never penned one that I would not be perfectly willing to have
                  incorporated with the Congressional Impeachment Report; and such ladies as have
                  recently written to me for subscriptions to the "Old Women's Home," or "Lady's
                  Club," are cheerfully referred to that Report for rescripts of such replies as
                  they may otherwise fail to receive.</p>
               <p>So, after two postponements and three trials, the Great Transformation Scene has
                  finally failed to work! Seven machinists, at the very last moment, become
                  convinced that the drama is immoral, and refuse to co-operate! Just before the
                  first postponement I saw one of them, <q>

                  is, I can but sing: Wade down upon the Swanee river, far, far away.</p>
               <p>Believing that the above remarks are sufficiently in the school of that ecstatic
                  morning journal, the New York "Times," to render it utterly impossible for the
                  most acute intellect to infer from them anything detrimental to my future
                  political interests, no matter which side may finally win, I hasten back to the
                  commencement of the present week and the fine old Southern Family of
                  Munchausen.</p>
               <p>At the breakfast-table, on Tuesday morning, Captain Munchausen paused a moment
                  over his how-cake, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"In honor of our guest, the suitor for our sister's hand the Chevalier Pendragon
                  Penruthers, I propose that eftsoons we proceed in knightly pageant to that haunt
                  of losel Yankees, where a convention of black-and-tan emancipated terriers will
                  this day nominate a military Vandal for next President of our—ha! ha!—common
                  country."</p>
               <p>Penruthers was looking quite gallantly in a black silk basque, lent him by his
                  affianced, a pair of red flannel inexpressibles, and a pair of white kid gloves;
                  and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Now, by my halidome, I would not miss the sight, an' it were even more base-born.
                  Pass me the hoe-cake, thou Yankee varlet."</p>
               <p>"Grammercy," says Captain Villiam Brown, after the manner of an ancient nobleman;
                  "an' thou speak to me again in that way, my fren', I'll crack thy costard."</p>
               <p>"Pax vobiscum, gentle sirs," quoth Loyola Munchausen. "Let us not quarrel with
                  these Northern churls."</p>
               <p>Matilda Munchausen tossed her head so that two hairpins fell into my tin plate,
                  and says she,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, that some knight would do a feat of derring-do upon these losel wights, ere
                  they should sit at wassail board with us at all!"</p>
               <p>"Matilda! Matilda!" expostulated Captain Munchausen, gloomily "eat your hoe-cake
                  in silence. It ill becomes our superior race to make our sufferings audible to
                  churlish ears."</p>
               <p>Thus in knightly conversation passed the meal, at the conclusion of which the
                  snuff-colored Hambletonian of P. Penruthers, Esquire, was hitched with trunk
                  straps to the family carriage, marked "U. S. Ambulance;" and we all rode merrily
                  to the building in which the Convention was being held. Owing to the high price of
                  brown stone and white marble, just now, in the sunny South, this imposing edifice
                  had been rapidly constructed of fence-rails and condemned horse blankets. Its
                  order of architecture was what might be technically termed the no-Capital
                  Corinthian; and over the entrance waved a national flag which gave evidence of
                  having been economically fabricated from a<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000100"/> torn sheet, a red flannel shirt, and a pair of blue
                  overalls. Soap-boxes had been placed on end in the interior for the accommodation
                  of delegates and visitors; and upon these we seated ourselves just as the Chaplain
                  arose to preface the vote with a devout petition.</p>
               <p>The good man prayed that all persons there assembled, whatever their hue and cry,
                  might be brought to vote as they had been told to, and to give up all their bad
                  habits and—</p>
               <p>Here the Hon. GEORGE WASHINGTON arose to a point of privilege; but was taken down
                  again.</p>
               <p>The chaplain went on to express the hope that these delegates, and all other
                  delegates whatsoever, might be taught to distrust their own wisdom, and to cease
                  that excessive drinking which—</p>
               <p>Hon. TIBERIUS CÆSAR here moved the previous question, and was at once obliged to
                  move it back again.</p>
               <p>Instead of proceeding that the Hon. CAIUS GRACCHUS was "making eyes at him." Even
                  as he spoke, a putty-ball, thrown by the Hon. NUMA POMPILLIUS, smote him on the
                  nose; whereupon he descended from his soap-box in great agitation and promptly
                  engaged the latter delegate in single combat.</p>
               <p>These preliminaries being settled, it was then proposed that the Last General of
                  the Mackeral Brigade be nominated by acclamation, and that a Platform be built for
                  him. Both of which propositions were successful.</p>
               <p>Yes, sir, both were enthusiastically indorsed; and if you expect me to say any
                  more on the subject just now, you are doomed to disappointment. Throughout this
                  whole letter I have displayed great political ability, and marvellous purity of
                  motive, in endeavoring to walk on both sides of the way at once. To say another
                  word about the above enthusiastic nomination on this occasion, would be to commit
                  myself one way or the other; and I must peremptorily decline so doing. A
                  splendid-looking, gloriously gifted, pure-minded young man is dependent upon me
                  for support, and I must not risk his interests by too hastily taking sides. He,
                  himself, richly deserves to be President, and his name is</p>

               </opener>
               <p>IN consequence of a temporary financial misunderstanding, superinduced by the not
                  remote military outages of Federal Vandals upon a knightly people, and still
                  prevailing with great fervor in this sunny clime, the telegraphic facilities here
                  lack that complete typographical finish which is observable in the electric
                  circles of wealthy monetary centres. The "First National Bullion Bank" of this
                  place, in the temporary dearth of gold, has a reserved Specie Fund of some two
                  grosses of brass buttons; which have coated at a fabulous premium ever since the
                  spring month know in Southern almanacs as Sherman's MARCH, and still fluctuate
                  wildly as news of Congressional proceedings indicate that the high-strung nobility
                  of this section are, or are not, to wear cotton dressing-gowns forever. In order,
                  then, to obtain prompt intelligence from our distracted National Capital, and so
                  regulate its rates in accordance with the variations of the Impeachment pageant,
                  the "First National Bullion Bank" recently encouraged the formation of a
                  joint-stock company for the construction of a telegraph to the nearest station.
                  Ten capitalists in dressing-gowns at once responded with venerable garden-rakes,
                  which were ably erected along the roadsides at proper intervals, as the poles of
                  the new enterprise; other daring speculators contributed numerous yards of old
                  bell-wire, which was pieced out with sections of hoopskirt-springs and laid
                  carefully across the tops of the rakes, and a battery, composed of two
                  pickle-bottles, an oyster-can, two bent stair-rods and half a pound of blue
                  vitriol, was placed in the hen-house selected as the office of the company.</p>
               <p>It is a slight drawback to the pleasures of familiar intercourse with this bloated
                  monopoly that its President reserves the right to read and make literary
                  improvements in all despatches addressed to Northern men; and that he is very apt
                  to send his love at the bottoms of your telegrams to female acquaintances; but the
                  enterprise will yet be self-sustaining, if a wholesome check can be placed upon
                  those members of the freed-negro race who have a present habit of stealing the
                  rakes at night; and with the completion of Reconstruction we shall witness the
                  establishment of an efficient police, to prevent the roosting of fowls along the
                  line.</p>
               <p>We have found such cool knights down here, that Captain Villiam Brown has taken
                  cold, and is obliged to keep constantly with him an oblong tin medicine-chest,
                  containing the cough-syrup know to the poets as "red eye." While he and I were

                  this night-blooming balsam, in my chamber at the Munchausen chateau, on Wednesday,
                  a messenger burst furiously in upon us with a telegraphic despatch; which, on
                  examination, I found to be the Response of the Last General of the Mackerel
                  Brigade to his nomination for President of the United States in 1869.</p>
               <p>"Huzza, my Chief-of-Garrison!" says I, patriotically; "just listen to this able
                  document." Whereupon I took out my piece of Smoked Glass—to save my eyes from
                  overdazzling—and read from the bottom of a bandbox, on which the Telegraph Company
                  had inscribed it, the following</p>

               <p>My own brain was spinning in a revolutionary manner; but I strove to be calm, and
                  says I,—</p>
               <p>"It appears to me, Villiam, that this great document is worthy of Carlyle. As I
                  understand it, the writer simply pledges himself not to 'lay down;' and seems to
                  imagine that it is a chief part of a President's duty to administer upon
                  wills."</p>
               <p>"My fren'," says Villiam, cautiously taking the bottom of the bandbox, to read

                              and a purely administrative officer should always be left free to
                              execute the will of the people. I always have respected that will, and
                              always shall. Peace and universal prosperity—it sequence—with economy
                              of administration, will lighten the burden of taxation, while it
                              constantly reduces the national debt. Let us have peace."</p>

               <p>I looked at Villiam questioningly, and says I,—</p>
               <p>"In the present depressed state of affairs, my Mars; own child, the Southern
                  telegraph would appear to be eccentric in punctuation, and disloyal in typography.
                  Allow me to taste a little more of your cough-syrup."</p>
               <p>"No, my fren'," says Villiam, hastily putting aside his medicine-chest. "After
                  such rebel trifling with my feelings, 'the red eye of bottle is shut in
                  despair.'"</p>
               <p>We might have discussed the question further, but for an extraordinary noise
                  coming up from below our window, outside, causing us to look hastily forth from
                  the casement. And there, in the court-yard of the chateau, with his head thrown
                  slightly back, his right knee thrown a trifle forward ward, to support his
                  instrument, and his corresponding hand laboriously turning the crank, was a scion
                  of one of the First Families that ever saw better days. His coat was the waist of
                  a calico frock, which had not been warranted to wash; his inexpressibles were the
                  former sleeves of another frock; his hand-organ was a coffee-mill inclosed in a
                  candle-box; and attached to a string, grasped by his left hand, was a small black
                  child to represent a monkey.</p>
               <p>"Behold," says I to Villiam, "how greatly reduced in circumstances are this once
                  opulent and chivalrous people, when one of them is thus compelled to organize for
                  a living."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, sceptically, "I saw a more reduced objeck than he, yesterday,
                  my fren." It was a New York pickpocket," says Villiam, confidentially, "who had
                  come down here on speculation; and in twenty-seven Southern wallets—which had
                  once, my fren', been used as infants' shoes—he had found only four buttons and a
                  seidlitz powder. He took the latter," says Villiam, gloomily.</p>
               <p>Ay, my countrymen, the man was dead-broke.</p>
               <p>Dead-broke, Mr. President. Dead-broke, my Senators and Congressmen. Dead-broke,
                  Right Reverends and wrong Reverends of every order. Dead-broke, men and women,
                  born with heavenly compassion in your hearts. And prying thus around us every
                  day!</p>
               <p>But, alas! even while the despairing poor are endeavoring to smother their misery
                  with the deadly seidlitz powder, the aristocratic and gay go on with their giddy
                     sports,<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7328-00000104"/> as though the world knew no
                  keener sorrow than the soiling of a white waistcoat. From our meditation upon the
                  woes of others, my friend and I were called forth to the field by the aged colored
                  seneschal of the chateau, to join a brilliant cavalcade of lords and ladies in the
                  Munchausen Hunt.</p>
               <p>This regular Southern Spring Meeting took particular eclat from the rumor that a
                  fox had escaped from a menagerie, recently travelling through the place on its
                  road to bankruptcy; and as the animal must have been at large on the surrounding
                  estates for nearly a week, and could not live upon mortages, it was argued that
                  his near approach to death by starvation would render it nearly possibly for the
                  thoroughbred hunters all hounds of the Munchausens to keep up with him.</p>
               <p>At any rate, upon arriving at the site of an ancient cabbage-patch, we found the
                  assembled party in great spirits. Sir Pendragon Penruthers, mounted gallantly upon
                  his own snuff-colored blooded racer. cut quite a figure in his black silk basque;
                  and as Villiam had recovered his clean collar from him, in the course of a single
                  combat near the refrigerator on the preceding evening he now appeared in a
                  standing-collar, cravat, and pair of gloves, done in white paint. Captain
                  Munchausen, in his dressing-gown, occupied a thoroughbred mare, which I took to be
                  a cross between a Hambletonian and a skeleton-wagon, the springs and axles being
                  clearly defined under the sagacious animal's glossy coat. Loyola Munchausen, in
                  his surtout of patent-striped Water-Proof Awning, hat made of half a boot-leg, and
                  top-boots manufactured from sections of stovepipe, bestrode a prancing bay, which
                  was shaped not unlike a narrow kitchen-table with the leaves down and a pig's head
                  on one end. Matilda Munchausen appeared upon a sorrel palfrey, whose marked fluted
                  developments on either side seemed to indicate that the spirited creature might be
                  opened and shut like an accordion. Matilda wore a riding-skirt of
                  organdy,—supposing organdy to be extensively used this season to imitate one
                  bombazine petticoat sewed to the bottom of another,—and her jaunty jocky-cap of
                  muskmelon rind, and honiton veil of mosquito-netting, reminded me of Sir Walter
                  Scott's Diana Vernon. The two stately gray pacers assigned to Villiam and myself
                  had rather too much trestle-work about them to be comfortable as steeds, however
                  well suited they might have seemed to civil engineers as studies for suspension
                  bridges; but, as they exactly resembled the other hunters in having the
                  trade-marks "U. S." on their flanks, I could not doubt that they came of the same
                  fiery breed. The Munchausen Huntsman, who was a member of the freed-negro race,
                  stood just beyond us, poker in hand, to restrain the energy of the panting
                  hounds,—a majority of which must have looked well when trotting under their native
                  butcher-carts, but now wore a melancholy air of having decided in their own minds
                  that such a thing as a butcher must have been merely a feverish dream of the past.
                  In fact, the whole scene was more English than American; and when the<pb
                     n="202 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7328-00000105"/> pack was set loose in full
                  cry, fires of chips kindled under all our hunters by the seneschal to make them
                  start, and the shout of "Tally-ho!" sounded by P. Penruthers, saluted my ears, I
                  felt like a British nobleman.</p>
               <p>Away we flew like the wind,—supposing the wind to zigzag and come down upon its
                  knees, occasionally, by reason of a little touch of spavin. Tally-ho! Tally-ho!
                  and along we hopped in frantic chase; only now and then stumbling over such of the
                  dogs as had suddenly paused in mid-career to take nervous nips along their
                  backbones. Tally-ho! Tally-ho! and wildly we scudded over the Hampton plantation,
                  leaping mortgages after mortgages, and dauntlessly putting our good steeds at the
                  very deepest sheriff's levies. Just after running against a haystack, Pendragon
                  Penruthers allowed Villiam and myself to come alongside; and says he,—</p>
               <p>"By'r lady, and I win not the brush this day, call me losel Yankee churl!"</p>
               <p>"Pardie!" panted Villiam, from half-way up the neck of his charger, "an' thou
                  reflect upon me again, my fren', I'll whack thy halidome."</p>
               <p>Tally-ho-ahoe!—and we could see the hounds all tangled together in a standing
                  snarl, the older ones making a dead "point" at something in the grass. But we
                  found the latter to be only a dried bone which had been dropped there in olden
                  times by our military Vandals; and on we all flew again, with the first mortgage
                  on the Peyton estate just in sight.</p>

               <p>Tally-ho! Tally-ho—Captain Muchausen's dressing-gown standing out from his waist
                  like some monster ruffle, Loyola's Water-Proof Awning fluttering high behind his
                  shoulders after the manner of dragon's wings, P. Penruther's black silk basque
                  catching wind in the likeness of a complicated balloon, and Matilda's long skirt
                  giving her the aspect of a giant umbrella tied to a flying mastodon.</p>
               <p>At the very height of this awful excitement, and while I was anxiously scanning
                  the fields ahead through my piece of Smoked Glass, a yellow animal suddenly
                  started out from the bushes just beyond the hounds, and, after tapping one of the
                  latter slightly upon the nose, scudded frantically away toward an adjacent
                  chateau, with tail erect and greatly magnified.</p>
               <p>Simultaneously, the maddening "view-halloo!" was given by somebody, and in two
                  more seconds Villiam and I, crying "Yoicks-yoicks!" had thrown ourselves from our
                  foundered hunters under the very walls of the chateau. The fox had entered an
                  opening in the stone foundation of the edifice, and passed under the ancient
                  building; and around the hole sat all the dogs on their hams, in magisterial
                  semicircle, with their tongues hanging waggishly out of their mouths.</p>
               <p>Feverishly eager to secure poor Reynard's brush before the others could arrive,
                  Captain Villiam Brown promptly knelt before the hole, and, peering therein, beheld
                  two luminous green glass balls, of the size of the marbles of his<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000107"/> childhood. Then, thrusting his right arm far in
                  under the chateau, a sound was heard as of an irascible elderly gentleman spitting
                  from a casement, and my friend changed countenance and hastily drew out his arm
                  again.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, excitedly, "as sure as you live, my fren,' the fox has gone
                  and scratched me."</p>
               <p>In the moment, and while yet he was unguardedly stooping almost double, a window
                  right at my nose flew open like magic, an aged unmarried sister-in-law of the late
                  Southern Confederacy appeared thereat, armed with a huge butter-paddle, and
                  passionately used the latter to inflict an ear-splitting spank upon the absorbed
                  fox-hunter.</p>
               <p>Overcome by feelings too intense to be expressed in print, the nearly murdered
                  Federal officer leaped high into the atmosphere, and came down upon a dog that was
                  making his toilet.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, rubbing himself, "what made you do that to me, Miss
                  Southerland?"</p>
               <p>The venerable maiden made a pass at me, also with the still quivering
                  butter-paddle; and says she,—</p>
               <p>"If I catch you chasing after my innocent cat in that way again, young man, I'll
                  hurt you wuss'n that!"</p>
               <p>Here the other members of the hunt came tottering up to the chateau, to apologize
                  to Miss Southerland for our ill-bred Yankee mistake; and, as the sight of two
                  distant Northerners, in straw hats had rendered out horses too restive for
                  mouthfuls of the latter to make further hard riding safe, it was agreed that we
                  should all return home forthwith.</p>
               <p>It being evident that the sufferings of the wounded Federal officer would be
                  increased by additional saddle-exercise, he preferred to walk, and I with him; nor
                  could I disguise my admiration at the manner in which this heroic young man drew a
                  useful moral from his late disaster.</p>
               <p>"My fren'," says he, limping slightly, "more than once has he who would catch the
                  Fox with one tail, come nearer catching the Cat of nine tails."</p>

               <p>A NOSE by any other name would smell as sweet, my boy,—which may account for the
                  occasional use of the term "bugle" in that connection; but who can doubt that the
                  proper name of a man may sometimes give him a popular sweetness quite beyond the
                  attainment of mere virtue or genius? Why is it that we so instinctively realize
                  our own insignificance, and feel crushed with a vague and awful reverence, when
                  confronted with such names as Paracelsus, Cagliostro, and Theodore Tilton? Then,
                  again, how is it that by writing out all the names they have, on every possible
                  occasion, some men may attain an inexpressible eminence, which had never been so
                  amply accorded to their mere patronymics aloe? Look at Ralph Waldo Emerson, James
                  Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Martin Farquhar Tupper. There is
                  something LARGE-SIZED about names in this style; something swelling and
                  tremendous; and they virtually make a pass at you with a big club, and say: "There
                  is much in the very sound of us that is more high-toned than language can express,
                  and if you will now prostrate yourself in the dust before us, without further
                  confusion, we will sit down upon you for a while on this pleasant summer day." You
                  say to yourself that you have your best cloths on, that the dust is disagreeable,
                  and that your feeble intellect fails to discover any reason just now why you
                  should be so crushed; but down you go, and are sat upon.</p>
               <p>Reconnoitring the political field, after the manner of a practical philosopher and
                  realizing that Ulysses is the first name of one Presidential aspirant, and
                  Pendleton the family-name of another, I am at once overpowered with intimidating
                  classical memories of the amazing single combat with bully Ajax for the amazing
                  single combat with bully Ajax for the armor of Achilles, and almost suffocated
                  with depressing premonitions of immense shirt-collar, gold-headed cane, and other
                  pharaphernalia of deep-voiced Respectability. In the mere sound of Ulysses I hear
                  the assertion: "There are several collegiate Greek reasons why I should take a
                  little walk over you for my health, whether you can find any English reasons for
                  the same or not." And in the sonorous roll of Pendleton I recognize the sentence:
                  "If you come of good family, young man, and have a letter of recommendation from
                  your father, you may tell your friends that I have noticed you."</p>
               <p>When, upon a late occasion, I took up a copy of the "Daily Mortgage,"—a loyal
                  journal, published here every morning on bits of old muslin,—and remarked the
                  popular enthusiasm with which the Presidential nomination of<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000109"/> UIysses, last General of the Mackerel Brigade, has
                  been received, I could not help feeling that a crushing name is half the battle.
                  In one column I found a letter to the name from an influential gentlemen in South
                  Carolina, who wrote: "All hail, sir! I take this opportunity to pledge the State
                  of New Hampshire for a majority of at least fifteen thousand votes in your favor;
                  and if you could make it convenient to lend about three dollars and a half to a
                  man who has always respected you, the prompt remittance of that amount to my
                  address would greatly oblige me." Another gentleman of high position, at Mugby
                  Six-Forks, Florida, writes: "The Empire State of New York will respond to your
                  nomination in a tone of thunder: and should you see fit to notice the enclosed
                  card of the Mugby State Lottery, the immediate mailing of one dollar will entitle
                  you to a large farm in Alaska, less our commissions." A venerable leader of
                  society in Bowieville, Arkansas, says: "Greetings, illustrious Solider! Next
                  November will find the good old State of Connecticut standing shoulder to shoulder
                  with her sister States in the triumph of your cause; and by enclosing four
                  shillings to the address here given you will receive my 'Advice to Those About to
                  Marry,' ny return of mail."</p>
               <p>Turning to the editorial page of this same journal,—the editor of which makes
                  quite a good living and almost pays the interest of his mortgages by alternately
                  writing articles in his office and selling ginger-snaps on the trains,—I find a
                  tribute to the other name. "Mr. Pendleton," says the editorial, "is a dignified
                  gentleman, of enviable social Position and refined Antecedents; nor do the most
                  elegant annals of distinguished Society present the old family-name of one taking
                  higher rank in the walks of unblemished respectability. His position in Circles to
                  which we all look for models of bigh-bred gentility is unassailed by the remotest
                  suspicion of plebeian Extraction; while his polished Manners and courtly Address
                  will ever commend him to the most exclusive Appreciation in this community, where
                  our well-known fellow-citizen Wade Hampton Breckenridge, Esq., is now offering a
                  large stock of ably selected family groceries at prices which few would credit,
                  and for which he gives no credit himself."</p>
               <p>Just sound over these names to yourself, my boy, and see how they will make you
                  grovel, whether you want to or not. Then ask yourself whether a John Jobkins or a
                  James Podgers could ever attain so much world-wide reverence by any great act he
                  might accomplish? See what your own noiseless name has done for you! You think
                  yourself handsome (poor wretch!, and believe that you are both Great and Good; but
                  you have not yet succeeded in gaining even the respect of your mother-in-law. No,
                  sir! no one has any respect for you; and unless you induce the Legislature to
                  change your name to something like Aurelius Stanhope Jinks, I don't see you are
                  going to keep out of the Poor-house this summer.</p>
               <p>Why, look at me, here, in this great Southern monetary centre, being crushed out
                  of all self-respect and self-defence<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7328-00000110"/> by
                  the name of Pendragon Penruthers, Esquire. This knight does not wear such clothes
                  as one would like to see George Washington dressed in; yet he has so cowed me by
                  his mere nominal sound, that I am growing more and more self-depreciatory in his
                  presence; and a subtle intuition of this fact makes him actually ignore my low
                  Yankee existence of occasions.</p>
               <p>This morning, while I sat quietly upon a butter-firkin, which had been sawed into
                  an easy-chair, in the drawing-room of the ancient Munchausen chateau, P.
                  Penruthers entered, with Matilda Munchausen hanging upon his arm, and escorted her
                  to a wash-bench, which had been covered with a rag-carpet to represent a luxurious
                  settee. Then, drawing over his hands a pair of white cotton socks, which he had
                  borrowed from Loyola for courting-gloves, and displaying them in a manner to
                  impress her with his splendors of costume, he buttoned his silk basque to his neck
                  to make himself emotionally hoarse, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Miss Muchausen, further concealment of my feelings were useless; by 'r lady, I
                  love—"</p>
               <p>Here I coughed to remind them of my presence; where-upon he waved one of the socks
                  toward me, in a haughty manner, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"You see, fayre lady, that NOBODY is here."</p>
               <p>Matilda ate a slate-pencil dipped in vinegar to keep herself from growing stout,
                  and says she,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, my Lord, I see that yonder easy-chair is VACANT."</p>
               <p>The faintly scornful sound of these casual remarks stung me into a conciousness
                  that I was indeed a Nobody, and presented a marked aspect of Vacancy; but, even
                  with the misfortunes of my Vandal Northern birth and noiseless name, I have
                  moments of vague self-respect; and, with an air of considerable hauteur, I drew
                  out my piece of Smoked Glass and proceeded to gaze thoughtfully through it at the
                  pageant of Love's Young Dream.</p>
               <p>"Matilda," went on Pendragon Penruthers, in a deep base voice, "our Families are
                  equally Old; ancient mortgages draw us together, and it becomes us to complete the
                  holy tie. Hessian Vandals from the scorpion North are buying up our fair domains
                  at about seven dollars per castle, and private park, and I expect, by my halidome!
                  to realize some thirteen dollars and a quarter for mine own estate withal. With
                  this amount, I can safely run in debt for one year, and I ask you, ladie fayre, to
                  help me therein."</p>
               <p>"My heart's Pendragon Penruthers," signed Matilda, drawing off a blue worsted
                  mitten and giving him one of her hands to kiss. "I am but a poor weak maiden,
                  unaccustomed to public speaking, and have but onethird-mortgage in mine own right.
                  If that is any inducement, you might take me; but first, let me ask, are you a
                  Ritualist?"</p>
               <p>P. Penruthers smote his forehead with one of his socks, then seized a hymn-book
                  lying upon a Louis<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7328-00000111"/> Seize table
                  (flour-barrel covered with drugget) near at hand, and tore it into thirty-one
                  fragments.</p>
               <p>"Matilda," says he, frenziedly, "I cannot tell a lie. A clergyman living next to
                  me once had one of his cherry-trees cut down and I did it with my little hatchet.
                  I am an infidel, a pagan, and a spiritualist. Let me not hide such facts from
                  thee, dear one,—now that NOBODY is listening."</p>
               <p>She threw up her white arms, and he, expecting a blow from her, drew hurriedly
                  back and pitched headlong over the sand-box, which (as he chewed) he had taken
                  care to have near his feet before beginning the conversation. She had meant
                  nothing, however, but the most trustful affection; and, as the arrogant knight
                  slowly picked himself up from the floor and made a stealthy reach for the poker,
                  the lady of the chateau, by a sudden movement, caught his head under one of her
                  arms, and spat a loud kiss upon his forehead.</p>
               <p>"And think you, my dearest lord," cried she, "that I would turn from you on that
                  account? No! You have said that you cannot tell a lie, and you did it with your
                  little hatchet. Could a George Washington do more?"</p>
               <p>"Do I remind you of Washington, then?" asked P. Penruthers, softly, wriggling his
                  head out of chancery, and regaining his feet again.</p>
               <p>"Very much," she murmured.</p>
               <p>An expression of melancholy settled upon his countenance nance, and he folded his
                  socks over the breast of his silk basque.</p>
               <p>"Matilda," said he, huskily, "is the interest on your mortgage all paid up?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Pendragon."</p>
               <p>Again the anguished knight smote his forehead with a sock, and says he, "How can I
                  tell his trustful being the whole truth? How can I reveal to her that my present
                  home is in—the Almshouse!"</p>
               <p>She darted out her fair hands toward him; and he, anticipating a blow after such a
                  revelation, attempted to withdraw a pace, and tripped heavily over my feet. But
                  her gesture had meant only a demonstration of augmented attachment, and, before he
                  could arise from the ground, she flew at him, took his face between her mittens,
                  and smiled down at him.</p>
               <p>"Pendragon Penruthers," she said, very distinctly, "just lie where you are, and
                  listen to me. Rather would I give Matilda's hand, heart, and mortgage to you, a
                  Southerner, though in the Almshouse, than to a Northerner with the carpet-bag of a
                  Crœsus."</p>
               <p>His position being unfavorable for any other gesture of pleasure, Mr. Penruthers
                  kicked ecstatically in the air with those limbs, on which appeared his red flannel
                  inexpressibles, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Then, by my halidome, I ask no more. Thou art mine, Matilda; and, come weal or
                  woe, we will starve together."</p>
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7328-00000112"/>
               <p>"And allow me," said I, putting up my Smoked Glass, "to congratulate you on the
                  spot."</p>
               <p>At the disagreeable Northern sound of my voice, the lady of the chateau permitted
                  the fallen nobleman to reach a standing position once more, and he cast a
                  supercilious glance toward my easy-chair.</p>
               <p>"I see NOBODY," says he, contemptuously; "and yet I heard a hideous noise."</p>
               <p>Matilda tossed her head, and says she, "I heard NOBODY speak."</p>
               <p>"So did I," quoth Pendragon Penruthers, Esquire.</p>
               <p>After which they both looked directly at me for five minutes, in the manner of
                  those who would have their nearest personal friends understand that they are
                  staring at vacancy, and then retired from the apartment with great aristocracy of
                  demeanor.</p>
               <p>Had plain John Smith treated me thus, do you think, my boy, that I would have
                  borne it? No, sir! I should have gone after John on one foot, and attempted, for a
                  single energetic instant, to climb his backbone with the other. But a man named
                  Pendragon Penruthers, Esquire <emph>must,</emph> in some way, have a right to
                  exhibit a far greater immensity of aspect than one who is only</p>

               </opener>
               <p>IT is only in the South, that our distracted Republic possesses any of that
                  dignity of ancestry and pride of castellated outbuildings, which are familiarly
                  described by those more celebrated American travellers who have been admitted to
                  the principal kitchens of Europe. Here, as I sit musing before the grand old
                  chateau of Captain Munchausen, with the Conic section of the Mackerel Brigade
                  encampment upon the lawn beyond me, and at my right, the Provisional Governor, on
                  a barrel, trying four members of the freed-negro race for refusing to work for
                  four dollars and a half a year,—as I sit thus surrounded by all the exciting
                  richness of a land's affecting redemption from error, methinks I can see far back
                  into the antiquity of this chivalric people, and hold spiritual converse with the
                  grand old cavaliers. Methinks I see the celebrated and high-spirited Duke of Lee,
                  in his rich corduroy mantle and Vandyke hat with turnpike tickets in the band,
                  guiding the blooded steeds of his chariotful of early cabbages to market. Methinks
                  I behold the Earl of Hunter, attired<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7328-00000113"/> in
                  the rim of a straw hat and robes slashed with white under-clothing, bending
                  pensively over the sweet-potato patch and reckoning the probable profit on his
                  jewelled fingers. Methinks I observe the brilliant Marquis of Pendleton, in his
                  plumped helmet of ventilated white beaver and toga of alpaca, making boots and
                  shoes for the nobility and gentry of the castles adjoining his own.</p>
               <p>Then, as I look up at the patrimonial chateau of Munchausen, with four mortages
                  upon it, and a Dutch oven sticking out of the side, I at once feel that there is
                  an unspeakable lowness about everything but hunting, and experience an inordinate
                  desire to be supported by a colored man.</p>
               <p>Taking the arm of Captain Villiam Brown, who had just been shaving himself with a
                  bit of glass sent to his room for that purpose, and following the direction of the
                  aged seneschal who was carrying in the hoe-cake on a dustpan, I proceeded to the
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">salle à manger,</foreign> where Captain Munchausen,
                  Matilda, P. Penruthers, and the Provisional Governor were awaiting us. Each being
                  pointed to his proper inverted peach-basket by the master of the revel, we seated
                  ourselves thereon around the groaning board.</p>
               <p>Wishing to promote conversation, I helped myself to some hard-tack, and said
                  I,—</p>
               <p>"Tell me, my mirror of knighthood, what mean these letters 'U. S.,' which I find
                  imprinted upon the crackers, the tomato can, the claret cork, upon every eatable
                  on this wassail board except the ho-cake?" Captain Munchausen drew closer around
                  his shoulders the calico window-curtain which formed his <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >robe de chambre,</foreign> and says he,—</p>
               <p>"By Chivarly! they mean '<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Unum Semper,</foreign>' or 'One
                  Always,' which is the Latin motto of my family."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, dreamily, "give us this day our daily Unum Semper. Do you
                  know, my fren'," says Villiam, pleasantly, "that all the meals of our Mackerel
                  beings are Unum Sempers too?"</p>
               <p>"Sir Vandal," said Captain Munchausen, "your remarks must not be tolerated. Will
                  you have a clean knife and fork?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sarah," says Villiam, majestically, "and another spoonful of motto, if you
                  please."</p>
               <p>"Sebeschal," said Captain Munchausen, "go to the armory and bring some more knives
                  and forks."</p>
               <p>"Stop, brother," said the Provisional Governor, observing that our haughty host
                  was making movements as though to stab Villiam in the back with a butter-knife;
                  "this is not time for the South to bluster. Let us rather stand by our noble
                  President in his conflict with the scorpions of the North."</p>
               <p>"Sir," responded the proud Virginian, "you teach me my jooty. And now what say
                  you?—shall we invite the vipers to our tournamong, that they may witness the
                  ancient knightly pastime of the superior race whom they have—ha!
                  ha!—conquered?"</p>
               <p>Here Captain Munchausen laughed horridly; and would<pb n="218-219"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000114"/> have grown hysterical with scorn had he not
                  suddenly remembered that his knees, which he had drawn up to the rim of the
                  wassail-board, were looking forth like a couple of bald-headed prisoners through
                  the airy interstices of their respective sable dungeons. Whereupon he arose
                  quickly to his feet, and says he, "Seneschal, how stands our ancestral
                  treasury?"</p>
               <p>The aged servitor stopped cleaning the knives, and says he—</p>
               <p>"S' help me gad, Mars'r, I hab done got only two shillings for workin' de whole
                  day yesterday for one of dem Yankees down yar."</p>
               <p>A terrible smile trickled over those of Captain Munchausen's features which
                  illuminated his whiskers like lamps in a forest, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Will the Messieurs Vandal be good enough to note the—ha! ha!—blessing of Freedom
                  to the colored race? Will they note how the freedman is able to support himself?
                  Two shillings a day!! Seneschal," said Captain Munchausen, hastily, "give me the
                  two shillings, then, and I will to try to get along with them."</p>
               <p>The venerable retainer passed the largesse to his lord, and soon we all started
                  for the field of chivalric adventure, after the manner of several Ivanhoes.</p>
               <p>Now, spirit of Orlando, thou matchless paladin and sturdy hater of cold water in
                  any application, come to my aid with as much brass helmet as possible, while I
                  describe the scene of Arthurian splendor which exploded upon our vision when we
                  reached the field of tournay.</p>
               <p>A piece of historical ground, which had proved upon trial to be unfavorable to
                  potatoes, had been set apart for the knightly pageant; and all four sides of it
                  were supplied with an ancient staging of four descending seats, which ended at
                  short intervals in pillars driven into the ground. A lavish baron of the olden
                  time, who did quite a good thing in the oyster trade, had bequeathed the interest
                  of seven dollars per annum as a fund for keeping the staging impregnable to
                  vagrant cows, and the fact that only a few roasting pigs were grazing in the
                  lists, when we arrived, spoke well for the use of the legacy.</p>
               <p>The top seat all around, singularly narrow as it was, seemed to have the
                  preference; and, as its occupants were privileged to hook their insteps and ankles
                  on the next seat below, and the two seats still lower were chiefly practicable for
                  the use of chickens, I did not wonder at the choice.</p>
               <p>Captain Villiam Brown and I now took out the bits of Smoked Glass with which we
                  always protect our eyes when viewing dazzling spectacles, and surveyed the knights
                  and ladies as they arrived and climbed to the top seat.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, "if that rail should happen to turn, my fren', how many would
                  experience reverses!"</p>
               <p>We were both of us cogitating over this idea, when Captain Munchausen motioned for
                  us to take seats on the barrels next to his, and says he,—</p>
               <pb n="220 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7328-00000115"/>
               <p>"Hist, Hessians! see you not, by 'r lady, that the contending knights have
                  arrived?"</p>
               <p>Sure enough, my boy, two or three of the seats had been let down upon the other
                  side of the glittering arena, and there entered four stately figures upon steeds
                  branded with the motto, "U. S." Forward they came across the field, to pay their
                  devoirs to the Queen of Love and Beauty in a bonnet of the latest fashion of the
                  Spring of '61; while a party of New York heralds erected, at proper points in the
                  lists, posts from whose cross-bars hung many curtain rings.</p>
               <p>First of the champions was Sir Cooke de Puddingwell, in a casque of soft black
                  felt, through the top of which some locks of his hair protruded in an ingenious
                  plume. His colors were crimson, and he wore them in the shape of a red flannel
                  under-garment which flowed upon his breast between the flaps of his
                  rather-tight-at-the-waist alpaca mantle.</p>
               <p>Next was the Viscount Morgeejee, descended from a noble Welsh family of cavaliers,
                  in a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chapeau de straw,</foreign> shaped somewhat like an
                  umbrella, and a dress-coat of rich cotton velvet, gored and made low in the neck.
                  His colors were blue merino, and he wore them in quatriform patches on each
                  knee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly was Sir Blessingen Desguys, of French cavalier stock, in a helmet of black
                  silk with very little of the nap rubbed off, and a mantle of brown linen trimmed
                  with tulle and hem-stitched up the front with narrow edging on<figure>
                     <head>Field of the cloth of Gold after it had suspended specie payment.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="221" xml:id="VAC7328-00000116"/> the sleeves, and gored down the back, with
                  a frill of applique at the waist. His colors were a yellow silk handkerchief, one
                  end of which protruded behind his ear from under his helmet.</p>
               <p>The last was Sir Render Awdye, in a white plush helm, which he was reported to
                  wear in bed, a rich jacket of green baize with round bone blazonries, and the
                  quarterings of his coat-of arms engrossed upon his costume just below the brief
                  tails of his jacket. He appeared to have no colors, being only a banneret; but
                  something white occasionally appearing at the foot of his spine as he moved in the
                  saddle suggested the possibility of a hidden scarf of spotless satin, the secret
                  gift of some ladye fayre. It might have been his pocket-handkerchief though.</p>
               <p>Each knight was armed with a lance with the broom part broken off, which he waved
                  in salute to the Queen of Love and Beauty.</p>
               <p>"By my halidome!" quoth Sir Cooke de Puddingwell, picking a leg of cold chicken,
                  and stirring up his fiery barb so that a little touch of spring-halt might not be
                  too visible, "an' I take not six rings to-day, call me churl."</p>
               <p>"Gramercy for thy liberality, gentle sir," retorted the Viscount Morgeejee, who
                  had just bought some peanuts.</p>
               <p>"By the rood! an' ye shall prove the boast to the death, an' our lady wills it,"
                  quoth Sir Blessingen, brushing a fly from the place where his courser had been
                  galled by the collar when ploughing. At this moment the New York heralds appeared
                  in the centre of the field, and proceeded<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7328-00000117"
                  /> to publish the <hi rend="i"/>Personals of the Coming contest. One of them
                  lifted up his voice, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Here ye all! If the four gentlemen who rode up to Chipmunk this morning wish to
                  continue their acquaintance with the four ladies who love them: let them at once
                  address themselves to obtaining rings."</p>
               <p>Then all the heralds joined in the chorus of "Largesse, noble knights, largesse;
                  "and then retired to play seven-up behind a nobleman's carriage with "U. S.
                  Ambulance" inscribed upon its panel.</p>
               <p>Passing one half of his apple to the nearest lady, and putting the other half into
                  his pocket, Captain Munchausen took a standing position upon his barrel, and says
                  he,—</p>
               <p>"Let the Tournamong proceed!"</p>
               <p>Away hobbled all the knights at the word, in a series of uneven hops best adapted
                  to the infirmities of the mettled of Arabians they bestrode; making directly for
                  the first post of rings and aiming with their lances to cary off one ring at
                  least.</p>
               <p>Sir Cooke de Puddingwell almost had one, when his blooded mare took fright at a
                  "chignon" in the range of his vision, ad staggered horror-stricken against Sir
                  Render's Hambletonian, with such a shock to that knight, as caused his helmet to
                  fall off and reveal a lunch of two roast apples on his head. Seeing their
                  advantage, the Viscount Morgeejee and Sir Blessingen made a gallant push for the
                  other post, amid the plaudits of the nobility and gentry; but Sir Cooke and Sir
                  Render, recovering, were there, too, as quickly, and the wriggling of all their
                  horses was as one sound.</p>
               <p>"By the Mass! Sir Viscount," said Sir Blessingen, hotly, "an' thou keep not thy
                  lance from the small of my back., I will make thee cry Gramercy!"</p>
               <p>"Ay, by my halidome!" quoth Sir Cooke de Pudding-well, "an' thou keep not thy
                  steed, Sir Blessingen, from trying to sit in my lap, I will serve thee an' thou
                  wert a varlet!"</p>
               <p>Here Captain Munchausen, who had just drawn a pair of clean white socks over his
                  hands to be more genteel, once more arose upon his barrel, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"The first round of the Tournamong is over. Five minutes for refreshments, by 'r
                  lady!"</p>
               <p>I turned to Villiam, whose inferior Sixth Ward nature had become dumfounded at the
                  courtly display, and said I,—</p>
               <p>"Well, my Iron Duke, how standest thou the feverish excitement of the scene?"</p>
               <p>"Hum!" says Villiam, musingly, "methinks I see the Arabian Nights of my childhood.
                  Methinks," says Villiam, historically, "that mine eyes behold the Field of the
                  Cloth the Gold,—after it has suspended speshie payment."</p>
               <p>I was about to rejoin, when the ringing of a dinner-bell by an extra herald
                  brought the knights in line again, and the tournamong raged with renewed force.
                  Owing to the fact that the steed of Sir Cooke, while lunching upon the tempting
                  tail of Sir Blessingen's steed bit unexpectedly<pb n="224-225"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000118"/> upon the raw, the latter nobleman suddenly went to
                  the front, with a plunge like a huge grasshopper, and, striking full against the
                  first ring post, brought it crashing to the ground.</p>
               <p>"A foul blow, by my halidome!" shouted Sir Cooke, impatiently striving to break
                  his charger of the habit of walking on three legs, which it had acquired in the
                  grocery business.</p>
               <p>"By the Mass! an' thou sayest so thou liest, base churl!" roared the agitated Sir
                  Blessingen, doubly frantic at having jammed his fingers and found his pockets
                  picked of four gingernuts.</p>
               <p>In a moment all was in confusion; and to add to the dreadful splendors of the
                  scene, Sir Render Awdye, in bending eagerly down from his saddle to look for
                  rings, made such a display of a pair of suspenders as caused several ladies to
                  faint on the spot.</p>
               <p>In short, the tournamong was over; and, after amicably uniting forces to chastise
                  three members of the freed-negro race who had been heard to laugh, the knights and
                  spectators went their ways, and we returned thoughtfully to the chateau.</p>
               <p>Can it be, my boy, that a people who thus retain all the usages and hardihood of
                  knighthood, really lack any radical essential to suit the pleasure of the

               </opener>
               <p>FROM those passionate days when the arms and feats of Woman had so wrought upon
                  the feelings of a British army that it toasted the Maid of Orleans, there has been
                  a marked tendency amongst owners of mothers-in-law to let the Toast be Dear Woman.
                  But we must remember, that, in the time of Joan of Arc, protracted celibacy often
                  subjected the unwedded fair one to the rigors of a convent; and, rather than come
                  to that many a maiden was willing to accept a suitor who was half-a-loafer, upon
                  the principle that half-a-loaf was better than nun. The English troops may have
                  regarded Miss Joan's late proceedings in the light of a loaf; and, having cut her
                  off from the latter, felt justified in toasting her over the same fire with their
                  stake. At any rate, the historical precedent from which modern mother-in-lawyers
                  take inspiration for their malevolent convivial <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >mots,</foreign> has no force at all for those genuine admirers and respecters
                  of the sex who ask no toasting for<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7328-00000119"/> the
                  modest, domestic young woman who is home-maid bred.</p>
               <p>If, in following my mention of the heroine of Orleans with the name of Matilda
                  Munchausen, I should also greet the latter as a Maid of Four Liens,—because at
                  least four liens are held against the estates of the Munchausens by low Northern
                  persons having mortgages thereon—there are those who would accuse me of greatly
                  exasperating them with a hideous pun. I think, therefore, that it will be well for
                  me to respect the unhappy prejudices of such critics, and save them from a
                  degrading display of their bad temper, by not doing so. Suffice it to say, then,
                  that the lady of the ancient Southern chateau, which I am now aiding to
                  reconstruct, is certainly worthy the proud old name of Penruthers, attained by her
                  to-day in the bond and mortgage of matrimony; nor shall the apparent slight
                  coolness of herself and her family toward me keep back my delicate tribute of
                  admiration on such an occasion as the present. Her chamber in the luxurious
                  Munchausen chateau has hitherto been immediately above mine; and, early this
                  morning, while she, with all her windows open (to disguise the absence of a whole
                  pane of glass from any one of them), was getting ready for the bridal, I overheard
                  her softly singing to herself the following graceful little</p>

                     lyrics of Hugo) to be expressive of pleasant girlish
                     badinage. The young bride jocosely asks her lover if he has
                     her umbrella (synonymous with parasol at the South just now).
                     To which it answered, that he has not;—that he really has but
                     the clothes he stands in. This is the French way of stating
                     that he is very poor. Then the bride, in the same spirit
                     again, wants to know who is to take care of her pet
                     saddle-horse after she is married, and attend to its ailings;
                     as the creature must now come very near to two persons,
                     instead of one? But, in the last quatrain, woman's heart at
                     once accepts the situation frankly, contends that a good name
                     is better than gluttonous living, hints that those are rich
                     enough who have the former, and archly asks a compliment for

               <p>Unconscious of a hearer, the lovely songstress was taking French-leave, so to
                  speak, of her girlish days. As the student returned from a college where he has
                  acquired great facility in misunderstanding Latin will occasionally sing bits of
                  supposed verse in that language in a way to sadden everybody, so did this
                  affianced Southern bride warble the plaintive lines she had, perhaps, learned at
                  her happy early boarding-school, where French was the language if desired by
                  parents. And while I listened to the melodious strain, and imagined the beautiful
                  strainer dropping a final tear to the memory of her sunny days of girlhood, I
                  could not but envy the haughty bridegroom destined to have her for his own; and
                  wonder how the mischief he was ever going to support her.</p>
               <p>Even while I mused thus, the sound of another voice saluted my ears from below the
                  casement,—the voice of Captain Munchausen, who, in consequence of an accident to
                  his ancestral treasury, had just borrowed three dollars from the aged colored
                  seneschal, of the chateau, to aid in the approaching nuptial pageant.</p>
               <p>"Seneschal," says he, coldly, "if this is all that the varlet Yankees have given
                  thee in Iargesse, I will e'en place it in my gipsire for want of more."</p>
               <p>The seneschal appeared to heave a sigh, and says he, "Dat's all I got, Mars'r
                  Captain; and I hope Mar'sr 'll let me go and vote for de Convention dis mornin'
                  before Miss 'Tilda gits married."</p>
               <p>His former owner scowled thoughtfully at the ignorant black, and says he,
                  "Seneschal, what is this Convention to do?"</p>
               <p>The venerable freedman scratched his head, and says he: "I don't know, Mars'r, but
                  I b'lieve it's to get up a new Consumption for de State."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the scornful Southron, with horrible bitterness. "You mean
                  Constitution, poor gorilla; and tell me now, thou sorry knaye, what is a
                  Constitution?"</p>
               <p>"I don't Zactly, Mars'r Captain," says the aged negro, "and dat's a fac'. I
                  'spect, though, dat its some kind of canonderdrum out o' de Bible.</p>
               <p>"And these," hissed the proud Confederacy through his set teeth, "these are the
                  creatures who are to—ha! ha!—rule the down-trodden South, while we, her mortgaged
                  white sons, are dissss-feranchised!! Why, yonder losel military scopion, from the
                  plebeian North, shall show more intelligence."</p>
               <p>Here the disfranchised knight hailed one of our Mackerels, who chanced to be on
                  guard near the porch, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Tell us, thou reptile, what is a Constitution?"</p>
               <p>"Constechooshun is it, ye mane!" says the soldier, in a voice that had often
                  reached the north Poll, "Sure, and its a bit ay paper that every Amairikin
                  citeezen signs whin he declares his intintions."</p>
               <p>At this moment Captain Munchausen was seized with a<pb n="230-231 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000121"/> violent cough; and says he, "O—ah—yes, I see. But
                  you can retire, sirrah."</p>
               <p>"As for you, Satan," says he, making a pass at the aged seneschal with the
                  oiled-silk umbrella-sheath, which he carried as a purse, "if you attempt to vote
                  I'll discharge you."</p>
               <p>But the seneschal, in return, made a pass at him with the dust-pan, and peevishly
                  asked for his money again; whereupon the passionate knight called aloud for
                  military aid from the United States; and, but for the prompt mediation of the
                  Mackerel, the long expected War of Races must have commenced at the South.</p>
               <p>Hark, though! The pewter spoon has been hung upon its wire in the dish-pan, and
                  the great bell of the chateau, thus reconstructed, rings a merry peal for the
                  bridal. Let all political differences, my boy, be lost in the fragrant smoke of
                  Hymen's torch, while I skip over intervening incidents and take you directly to
                  the wedding.</p>
               <p>Inasmuch as the principal sacred edifice of this financial metropolis was torn
                  down, during the recent Federal carnage, by our military Vandals (because some
                  thirteen unconquerable Confederacies in spectacles occupied the turret with
                  duck-guns, and created now standing is composed of the body of an Dry Dock
                  omnibus, presented by wealthy southern exiles in New York, with a steeple over the
                  door-end formed successively of a cracker-box, a fish-keg, and a nine-shilling
                  gothic clock. This stately triumph of Noah's<figure/>
                  <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7328-00000122"/> Arkitechture is said to look much like
                  the famous English church of St. Mary-Axe, but, as it is not quite so large, it is
                  very properly called St. Mary-Hatchet; and here, in this cathedral, with a
                  spacious blackberrying-ground around it, the marriage of P. Penruthers and M.
                  Munchausen would have been solemnized, but for the high-handed conduct of a
                  prominent church-officer. To speak plainly, it is the custom of the sexton of the
                  cathedral of occupy the driver's seat of the former omnibus during the service,
                  and, by means of the strap wound about his leg, permit none of the congregation to
                  open the door and slip our while the collection is being taken up. When applied to
                  by the brothers of the bride, this embittered official agreed to admit the party
                  to the cathedral, but utterly refused to think of such a thing as letting them out
                  again without a collection for his won benefit. This, of course, settled the
                  matter, as the Rothschilds still mysteriously refrain from subscribing to the new
                  Munchausen Loan; and it was decided that the ceremony should take place, according
                  to the forms of the Ritualists, at the chateau.</p>
               <p>Nowhere save at the South, at this particular period of Reconstruction, is a
                  Ritualistic wedding seen in all its pomp. That is to say—nowhere else are so many
                  Pompeys present. As I gazed to-day at the row of sable retainers around the
                  nobility and gentry at the wedding, and wondered whom they expected to collect
                  their next quarter's wages from, it struck me that the Sheriff's writual had its
                  element there. Thus do wordly thoughts intrude upon the most solemn scenes, and I
                  merely mention it as an original discovery.</p>
               <p>Captain Villiam Brown and I had been invited, on condition of lending clean
                  collars, and furnishing a box of candles for the ceremony; and when we entered the
                  saloon of the chateau and gazed through our pieces of Smoked Glass upon the scene,
                  the brilliancy of the latter made us wink. The mangle, brought in from the kitchen
                  and converted into a covered table by means of a white counterpane, bore some
                  twenty burning tallow-candles in soda-water bottles. Above it trembled a tasteful
                  canopy, made from the top of a sugar-barrel, draped with evergreens. Behind it, on
                  the wall, hung a picture representing the arrest of one of the early Christians
                  for debt. At the table stood the Ritual rector, in chasuble made of the stuff left
                  over from the two large blue cotton umbrellas which Villiam and I had given to be
                  made into a bridal-gown and hoop skirt for the lady of the chateau. To the right
                  were a band of boy-choristers, from the local Orphan Asylum; on the left, a
                  company of acolytes from the neighboring Country House; still farther to the left
                  was the choir, composed of the Mackerel Brass Band with his nigh-key bugle, and
                  the aged colored seneschal, with a large comb wrapped in paper; around the room
                  sat the family and guests, on inverted peach-baskets; and, feeling the table and
                  rector, stood the lordly Pendragon Penruthers, Esquire, and his Southern
                  bride!</p>
               <p>You can form no idea of the knightly and chivalric aspect<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000123"/> pect of this people, my boy, save in a courtly
                  pageant like this. You at the North are chiefly familiar with Southern medical
                  students, who instead of using the ancient lance for artillery, use the modern
                  lancet for ill artery but, if you want to see what Chivalry really is, at the
                  South, come gaze through my Smoked Glass at this scene of Ritualism.</p>
               <p>The Ritual rector now intoned a Nux Vomica, accompanied in a slow adagio movement
                  by night-key bugle and comb; and then, looking steadfastly at the couple, snuffed
                  out two candles with his fingers. This signified that all their past separate
                  lives, save debts and mortages, were extinguished by marriage. Bride and groom
                  bowed assent; the acolytes filed between them and the table; and the Ritual rector
                  snuffed-out the remaining candles,—which signified that the family couldn't afford
                  to let them burn any longer, as they had no others in the house.</p>
               <p>Next, in time to slow music by the choir, the Ritual rector lifted from the
                  interior of the mangle a living wren, it s little feet and wings tied, and itself
                  lying upon about ten cents' worth of ice. What this chilled wren signified I could
                  not understand exactly, but bride and groom again bowed very low.</p>
               <p>"Then I pronounce you mortgaged to each other for life," says the Ritual rector,
                  commencing to eat an apple (significant of Eve's transgression), and the
                  boy-choristers at once began a solemn dance about the pair, singing<q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This concluded the impressive ceremony. The twain had been made one, for better,
                  for worse, in life and in debt; and, after the usual congratulations, the whole
                  party repaired in procession to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">salle à
                     manager,</foreign> where a wedding-banquet of hoe-cake and United States
                  rations awaited us. The ritual rector came with the rest, in high spirits, being
                  apparently affected by some sort of congestion of the brain, which led him into
                  the wild fancy that he was to be paid something for his services; but as the
                  moments rolled on, and the knightly brothers of the bride still dodged him around
                  peach-baskets and behind doors, he gradually settled into hopeless melancholy, and
                  finally went home to his starving family.</p>
               <p>Not knowing where they might get their next meal, the bride and her haughty lord
                  ate heartily; giving me opportunity to observe their happiness without peril of
                  resentment for my staring. And, as I studied the spacious cheek of Matilda, memory
                  went back to other days in<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7328-00000124"/> the sunny
                  South, when I, myself, had been near offering hand and heart to a belle no less

               <p>Ah, well! such memories have no business at a Munchausen wedding, my boy; and to
                  the latter let us return without farther reminiscence.</p>
               <p>When evening came, the great bell of the chateau called us out to the lawn, to
                  witness a surprise in the way of fireworks; and when, at a given signal from
                  Captain Munchausen, the torch was applied to a school-house recently erected by
                  vulgar Yankee capital for the freed-negro race, the display was really
                  creditable.</p>
               <p>Here let me take leave of the pageant, while yet its glory must be dazzling every
                  eye. The union of two loving hearts is a topic to which one poor goose-quill never
                  yet did justice,—a whole goose being requisite for the purpose. Will these two be
                  any less happy because they must go to the Almshouse pretty soon? Will a shadow
                  rest upon their united lives because a rash Collector of Income Taxes committed
                  suicide here last evening, shortly after conversing their gains during the past
                  year? Let us hope not. Let us trust that, as they gradually starve to death—their
                  love for each other as profound as their hatred of the scorpion North which still
                  refuse six months' credit,—they may find in each other's company additional
                  courage to scorn negro-suffrage and heap fresh contumely upon the head of any
                  Northern man who would seek to rescue them from the first-mentioned
                  consummation.</p>

                     AND REPORTING SOME OF THE ORATIONS AT SUSPER COLLEGE COMMENCEMENT.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THE human soul—how sensitive a thing it is! especially before its owner hears from
                  his poor relations, or has a wife subject to sick-headache. How keenly alive it is
                  to every impression of Change, even when the latter is not change for five
                  dollars! How quickly will it swell, or collapse, at the least variation in the
                  chromatic scales of that instrument of piano and forte emotions which we call
                  Home!</p>
               <p>You return to the latter after the day's business; and, before you have seen or
                  spoken to a soul there, a subtle sensibility to some unpleasant change in it comes
                  sickeningly over you. In another moment you detect a carpetbag and bandbox in the
                  hall, and then you know that your wife's mother has come to spend a week with you.
                  Regaining the same Home after a brief trip to the country, there is something in
                  the aspect of the very front-door that inexplicably impresses you with a
                  delightful sense of home's sweetest tranquillity. You enter, and are informed that
                  your eldest unmarriageable sister-in-law has decided to defer her visit until next
                  summer. So it is that some mysterious intuitive intelligence of the human
                  soul—that possession coming by nature to every man save the New Jerseyman—detects
                  the sadder and happier domestic changes for us long before the material senses can
                  act. Thus it is that we need no telling to comprehend, that the man with the
                  pew-bill has been waiting for us in the parlor nearly half an hour.</p>
               <p>And how much stronger is the vibration of this fine instinct, when the very
                  loudest component element of home has gone out of it! There has been a Marriage in
                  the house, and the merest stranger asks no telling to be aware of it before he has
                  been within the door five minutes. There is no more poking of a head in
                  curl-papers over the baluster of the second-story stairs every time the
                  street-bell rings. There is no more screeching of alternate hymn-verses and
                  "Duchess of Gerolstein" hand-organ airs through the third-story hall until eleven
                  o'clock every morning. There is no more slapping of infant brothers to stop their
                  crying for tumbling downstairs, and make them learn not to take their sister's
                  back-hair off the bureau and use it for a ball another time. There is no more
                  driving of nails (of her fingers) on the piano-fore, with all the parlor-windows
                  open, at what a merciful Providence intended to be the quietest hour of the
                  evening. There is no more standing on the front-stoop and taking three-quarters of
                  an hour to scream and giggle a good-night to the departing Young Man already
                  half-way to the corner, when five<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7328-00000127"/>
                  single gentlemen on the same block, who <emph>must</emph> get up at five o'clock
                  in the morning, are trying to swear themselves to sleep. No; there has been a
                  Marriage in the house, and the yearning souls of the survivors plaintively
                  acknowledge that the cessation of so much sweetness and noise makes it seem just
                  like Sunday, at home.</p>
               <p>The late Confederate pageant of a Ritualistic marriage has left the ancient
                  chateau of the Munchausens so lonely for me that I have made a flying excursion to
                  Succotash Court House, where even orations by collegians are better than no noise
                  at all. On the morning after the wedding, when Pendragon Penruthers, Esquire, his
                  bride and brothers-in-law, started for a day's bridal-tour of the Charitable
                  Institutions of Chipmunk Court House, Captain Villiam Brown and I were directed to
                  remain in the kitchen with the aged seneschal and help clean the knives; but
                  Villiam's unhappy disposition to want nobody to get married but himself had made
                  him such poor company for the occasion, that a sense of there having been a
                  marriage in the house grew intolerable to me, and I suddenly resolved to take a
                  sail up the Potomac for the day. When I told him of my determination, Villiam was
                  cleaning a costly cast-iron carving-knife, which, as there had been no earthly use
                  for it in the family since late Vandal war, had grown quite rusty—and says
                  he,—</p>
               <p>"Go, my fren', and I will continue the great work of Reconstruction alone until
                  your return. "Ah!" says Villiam, trying the highly-tempered blade on his
                  fingernail nail, "it is now nearly time for our ten o'clock snub, and that bright
                  being is not here to give it to us."</p>
               <p>Perceiving that his Democratic Northern nature drooped in the anticipated absence
                  of those daily affronts to which we were accustomed. I tried to comfort him with
                  the certainty that Lady Penruthers would yet insult us oftener than ever before
                  she finally went away with her lord to his home in the Almshouse; and so greatly
                  did the assurance cheer him that, just previous to my departure, he cleaned a
                  broken and very difficult fork in three minutes.</p>
               <p>A brisk walk of about an hour—through plantations so covered with mortagages as to
                  be actually dying because neither son nor heir could get to them—brought me to the
                  landing where the Confederate steamboat, "South C. Bubble," built in South
                  Carolina, awaited such passengers as the captain was willing to trust for their
                  passage-money. The floating palace, in question, had formerly been a coal-barge'
                  but now, by aid of a second-hand cooking-stove, a tin clothes-boiler, a steam-pipe
                  from thence to the hickory pistons of a walking-beam which had been ingeniously
                  manufactured from a large wagon-spring, and a couple of U. S. ambulance-wheels at
                  the sides, she made the best steamer that it was possible to run on credit.</p>
               <p>My payment of my passage in actual money threw the entire crew into a profuse
                  perspiration, and caused the captain to exhibit temporary signs of apoplexy; yet,
                  at the proper moment, the great naval commander was sufficiently recovered to
                  mount one of the wheel-houses,<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7328-00000128"/> (half a
                  cheese-box), draw forth his galvanized chronometer, and signal the engineer to
                  turn on the steam from the clothes-boiler. Wush-wush-wush-h-h went the
                  ambulance-wheels, high curled the smoke from the stack of old hats acting as a
                  smoke-pipe, and along moved the majestic vessel, after the manner of a dying
                  swan.</p>
               <p>Perceiving, from my payment of fare, and the absence of holes form the elbows and
                  knees of my garments, that I was a scorpion carpet-bagger from the plebeian North,
                  the company on board did not invite me to join in the games of euchre which they
                  were playing for bone-buttons, just abaft the mainstay; and, to keep myself in
                  countenance, I soon repaired to the dissecting-table of the surgeon of the ship,
                  and nearly threw that glassy official into a fit by paying him to make me a
                  strawberry festival.</p>
               <p>In coarse Northern cities, a strawberry festival, when gotten-up in aid of some
                  church, or charitable institution, is made as follows: A glass vessel, holding
                  about a pint, is supplied with enough ice to preserve the fruit, and upon the
                  extreme top thereof, two, and sometimes three strawberries are carefully placed.
                  Then, a rich sauce, composed of sherry, a little brandy, a spring of mint, a slice
                  of orange, a bit of pineapple, and a tall, hollow straw (hence STRAW-berry
                  festival), is poured over the preserved berries, and the festival is ready for
                  church-members. but, at the South, just now, owing to a momentary difference with
                  the Rothschilds, ice is too expensive to be had; so the surgeon of the ship used
                  some fragments of broken glass bottles instead; and, as his nearest approach to
                  sherry and brandy was some molasses and water, the strawberry festival he made for
                  me was not as stimulating as I have known such festivals to be.</p>
               <p>In fact, shortly after partaking of this strawberry festival, I was seized with a
                  serious seas-sickness; and as the vessel was stopping just then at Succotash Court
                  House to land those who had come thither to attend the commencement of the
                  celebrated Susper College, I too went ashore to shake off my illness by a passing
                  glimpse of the Confederate educational pageant.</p>
               <p>Susper College boasts a faculty composed almost exclusively of Major-General
                  Southern Confederacies who have not yet been hung for pointing and discharging
                  disloyal artillery against the United States of America, and occupies a large
                  wooden building situated upon one of the largest mortgages in the State. Prior to
                  certain late Federal outrages upon a wealthy and chivalrous people, the Southern
                  youth, attending this institution of learning, wore dress-coats at all hours of
                  the day, and spent nearly as much money for "poker," and other necessaries of
                  life, as would have sufficed to pay the interest on their fathers' debts. During
                  the present season, however, they are attired in coats and continuations, which
                  bear more rags to the acre than ever came before from sowing tares; and when a
                  young student of sixteen named Lieutenant-Col-onel Montmorency, stood upon the
                  ironing-table, used as a<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7328-00000129"/> rostrum, to
                  deliver his oration, I noticed that his coat was fastened in front with a wooden
                  skewer.</p>
               <p>The orations were impassioned, and scholarly appeals in behalf of State rights
                  Southern sentiment, showing that what the South now needs are independence and
                  capital. Colonel Chilmondely, a fervid young student of thirteen, spoke of
                  Virginia as the Mother of Mortgages, and drew a fine ideal picture of the future
                  days when all her debts should be paid off, and her railroads and her colleges
                  able to borrow some more money. Major Ilfracombe, aged twelve, and wearing a
                  brass-headed nail for a scarf-pin spoke eloquently of the State-debt, which, he
                  said, like the mighty Mississippi emptying into the sea, emptied into the Bankrupt
                  Act.</p>
               <p>Captain Penremington, aged nine years, urged his brethren to go boldly forth
                  College into the North, and demand—ay, DEMAND! six months' credit. The time had
                  now arrived when the South should assert herself, and,—in helm and with spear, if
                  necessary,—,—claim her share of the ill-gotten wealth of the North. (Great
                  sensation.) Let the South say to the North,—"We do not want you yourselves with
                  us; but we have need of your small change, to develop our great resources
                  (tremendous enthusiasm), to educate and exterminate our servile population, and to
                  prepare ourselves for another and mightier struggle with your vandal military
                  scorpions. (Prolonged cheers.) Then, after obtaining the small change, who could
                  doubt that the renovated and newly armed South would <q>

               <p>When the enthusiastic applause had subsided, General Hardupton, of South Carolina,
                  mounted the ironing-table, and proceeded to address the Literary Societies of the
                  College upon the "Duties of Citizenship." He told the students that, as citizens
                  of the Republic, it would be their first duty to be devoted exclusively to their
                  first duty to be devoted exclusively to their own State, which, upon the whole,
                  was the only State in the union worth mentioning. Let them remember her host of
                  noble sons, who comprised all the United States' Presidents worth speaking about.
                  At present, she was pecuniarily embarrassed, but would yet pass (should the
                  Bankrupt Act be proved Constitutional) from debt into life. In conclusion, he
                  solemnly warned the young man against ever "playing policy'" to the detriment of
                  their principal. If the temptation beset them, let them go into the nearest

                  <p>WHICH DILATES UPON THE MILITARY MIND AS AFFECTED BY SOUTHERN EXPERIENCE; SHOWS
                     HOW A DESERVING SOUTHERN UNIONIST WAS FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY TRIED BY

               <p>TO the military mind, withdrawn from contemplation of the ensanguined field
                  through a spy-glass, and informed upon application that there are no immediate
                  vacancies in the Custom House,—there is nothing more profoundly interesting than
                  the spectacle of a superior people gradually rising from their first unmitigated
                  astonishment at defeat, and rapidly regaining their original largeness of
                  impressive shirt-collar. The military mind, I say, in its few instances of not
                  being called immediately after a war to illuminate the office of Governor or
                  Secretary of State, finds a weird fascination in this development of a high-toned
                  characteristic of superior blood, and has been known upon certain garrison
                  occasions to grovel ecstatically before so much renewed immensity of aspect. The
                  mechanical effects of martial discipline, and some remembrance of having tended a
                  restaurant in earlier life, frequently conduce to make the American Military mind
                  exquisitely sensitive to that<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7328-00000131"/>
                  peremptory demand for an attached waiter which continually effulges from a
                  dress-coat mien sufficiently overbearing; and many a brass-buttoned brigadier of
                  our invincible army has paused, as commandant, in some refined Southern town of
                  his conquest, only to fall a prostrate valet before the large-sized demeanor of
                  its most insulting and respectable citizens.</p>
               <p>These reflections coursed pleasantly through my mind, and caused me to wink
                  knowingly with may mind's eye, as I stood in the little encampment, on the lawn of
                  the chateau, and listened to the talk of our reconstructing National troops. There
                  was one Mackerel cheerfully trying the range of his gun, by firing a few
                  experimental bullets at a member of the freed-negro race on an adjacent fence;
                  and, just as the redeemed freedman put down his hoe-cake on a post to see what was
                  in his hat, he turned immediately to another Mackerel, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"It's naygurs, the like of him convanient to the fince, that they kape us here to
                  purtect, whin the war's over intirely. An, sure, why couldn't they lave the black
                  craytures to the gintleman that ouns them, and lave us to go home an' vote?"</p>
               <p>The other Mackerel stopped dealing out rations to the aged seneschal, who had just
                  come with a basket for the Munchausen, family-breakfast, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Why, Antonio, nobody ouns them now. They're free, and will be a comin' and takin'
                  the bread out of our mouths next."</p>
               <p>Antonio only paused a moment, to kick the seneschal, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Ir's bate them, I would if I was the gintleman, and then see if it's us white min
                  that would interfere. Ah, but it's the rale gintleman he is, up at the house
                  yonder; an' I've not seen the like of him since I came over. He doesn't be spakin'
                  to common floks the like of us, at all, sure; and that was the way with Lord
                  Dunlaff when I tinded his horses at home."</p>
               <p>I turned from the spot, musingly, my boy, and it occurred to me that thee is
                  possibly a greater capacity for popular influence in cheek than in mouth.</p>
               <p>But why lingers my pen around these beautiful incidents, like a bee around
                  flowers, when the stern duty of the historian requires it to skip all the fragrant
                  poetry of human nature, and make note only of its scents-less and cons? Why
                  dallies my forgetful quill with what may be termed foreign phlox, when it should
                  be busy with something closely approximate to its native goose?</p>
               <p>Let Thems—Titanic Goddess, as Hesiod would have her—shrink to the dimensions of a
                  little girl with a "chignon," and hide her increased head, while I relate to an
                  excited universe thedetails of Captain Villiam Brown's court-martial-inquest, in
                  the case of a Southern Union man of Chipmunk, accused of having remarked, that he
                  cared not what others might say, but, as for him, give him liberty or give him
                  death.</p>
               <p>It did not appear that this observation had any particular<pb n="252-253"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000132"/> application to anything excessively national; in
                  fact, the said observation was believed by some to have been merely a quotation
                  from Patrick Henry, and having reference solely to a question of African choice
                  between emancipation and freedom; but Villiam at once convened a Mackerel
                  court-martial in the back kitchen, with an intelligent brought in with his
                  counsel, Villiam frowned majestically upon him from the mangle. and says he,—</p>
               <p>"Prisoner at the refrigerator, you are arraigned on a charge of having uttered
                  incendiary words, and are here to take your trial for better or worse. Have you
                  any reason to show why sentence of death should not be pronounced upon you?"</p>
               <p>Here the counsel for the defence arose hastily from a wash-tub, says he,—</p>
               <p>"Now this is really—"</p>
               <p>"Silence, sarah!" says villiam, sternly, "and don't try to bully this court, which
                  knows more about law." says Villiam, emphatically, "than ever you read of in
                  Story. You musn't try any of your bullying here, sarah!"</p>
               <p>The counsel for the defence merely wished to state—</p>
               <p>The Judge Advocate suggested that it was scarcely worth while to heed this
                  wretched man's miserable drivel; but if the convicted traitor at the refrigerator
                  would not at once confess himself guilty of arson against the government, the
                  witnesses must appear.</p>
               <p>Therefore, J. Smith, being duly, sworn testified that he had known the prisoner at
                  the refrigerator for some time, and always believed him to be fiend in human form;
                  had frequently supposed him to be a brute in human shape, and remembered he had
                  once asked a man at a deaf and dumb asylum if he did not think so too. Could not
                  tell precisely the hour on each day when he had spoken of the accused as a demon
                  in human habiliments, but thought it was every hour; the prisoner had owed him
                  four dollars and a half for three years.</p>
               <p>Counsel for defence put on his spectacles, and says he,—"But how did—"</p>
               <p>Here the Judge Advocate wished to inform the caricature of humanity then speaking,
                  that he must not try any of his low bullying here, because it wouldn't do. He must
                  not attempt to intimidate this court with his vaporings.</p>
               <p>The following witness, Alonzo Tubbs, being sworn, deposed that he had known the
                  prisoner at the refrigerator four years. and must admit that he regarded him as a
                  monster in human guise; had at times pronounced him to be a modern Nero, and often
                  thought he resembled a wolf in sheep's clothing had spoken to prisoner once as to
                  the feasibility of his lending seven shillings for a few days, and had been
                  refused in traitorous language.</p>
               <p>The counsel for the defence drew a paper from one of his pockets, and says
                  he,—</p>
               <p>"Will the witness inform the court—"</p>
               <p>The Judge Advocate desired to know whether the ravings<pb n="254-255"
                     xml:id="VAC7328-00000133"/> ings of the maddened blusterer then howling were to
                  be longer permitted? He must be taught that this was no place to bring his
                  threatening airs. His braggadocia would not be here.</p>
               <p>Abel Drinker, being properly sworn, stated that he had known deceased often, and
                  believed the counsel for the defence to be capable of any crime when under the
                  influence of liquor—</p>
               <p>Here the counsel for the defence tore his hair, and says he,—</p>
               <p>"I protest against—"</p>
               <p>"Silence, sarah!" says Villiam, "or I'll try you for the assassination of your
                  father. You can't bully this court, sarah!"</p>
               <p>The Judge Advocate could not pause to mention that the calumnious pettifogger had
                  several times attempted the life of his mother, but would consent to the
                  introduction of his first witness—not in obedience to any of his bullying
                  though.</p>
               <p>Docter Gigby, being sworn, affirmed that he had attended the prisoner at the
                  refrigerator during a recent illness, during which the said prisoner had
                  complained of seeing monkeys; at one stage of the disease heard say "Our noble
                  President" very distinctly—</p>
               <p>"Ah!" says Villiam, with such a start that he nearly fell into the mangle, "what
                  was that?"</p>
               <p>"He said, 'Our noble President' very distinctly."</p>
               <p>"Hum!" says Villiam. "If he said that, sarah, I hereby squash the indictment, and
                  declare him man and wife. Let the counsel for the defence be committed for a
                  further hearing."</p>
               <p>And, the court being therefore instantly dissolved, we repaired to the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">salle à manger,</foreign> where Captain Munchausen, Matilda, P.
                  Penrutheres, the Provisional Governor, and an aged Confederacy (who introduced the
                  stately fashion of wearing an overcoat and muffler indoors, by reason of being
                  temporarily deficient in the frock-coat and shirt-collar department), awaited us
                  at the groaning supper-board.</p>
               <p>"Gen-til-men," said the Provisional Governor, disguising a sneer in a highly
                  unnatural cough, "let me introduce General Lately (as slightly distinguished from
                  General Early), whom we propose to install as President of Cotton Seminary
                  to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Hum!" says Villiam, attentively eying the aged stranger through his bit of Smoked
                  Glass. "Methinks I have seen that being behind a musket, propelling glossy
                  missiles toward the United States of America."</p>
               <p>"You have, my man," responded the venerable Washington, in a deep bass tone; "but
                  I am now a cultivator of earth's teeming bosom, and have forgiven everything. I
                  have advised those who have surrendered their muskets, to fire no more at present;
                  but rather to give up slavery for the time being, and pay the freedmen six dollars
                  yearly for their labor."</p>
               <p>"And I," said the Provisional Governor, returning from a brief absence, "have just
                  directed the troops on the lawn<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7328-00000134"/> to
                  march away at once, by authority of our noble President; for my brother is now
                  sufficiently reconstructed to dispense with the military—who," said the Governor,
                  casually, "have been ordered to leave their rations behind with our
                  seneschal."</p>
               <p>"Furthermore," exclaimed Captain Munchausen, rising with dignity from a plate of
                  biscuit marked "U. S."—"furthermore, my sister can no longer endure the presence
                  of vandals drenched in the gore of her forefathers, and your immediate flight from
                  the chateau will be a cause of family congratulation."</p>
               <p>Here Matilda turned toward us, so that we could see the new buttons on her dress;
                  and a dreary voice, which seemed to say something about "them nasty Yankees," was
                  heard to float tenderly upon the twilight air.</p>
               <p>Villiam and I moved simultaneously toward the door, and says Villiam,—</p>
               <p>"Tell me, sarah, what message shall we convey to the United States of
                  America?"</p>
               <p>"Tell them, "said captain Munchausen advancing, supported by the Provisional
                  Governor and the aged Confederacy, who had just hauled a couple of muskets from
                  under the table, "tell them that Munchausen is fully reconstructed, and will
                  shortly demand a bottle of pardon for the patriot Jefferson Davis."</p>
               <p>"But, my Chevalier Bayard," said I, in bewilderment, "this reconstruction is only
                  a Congressional experiment."</p>
               <p>"Tell them," said Captain Munchausen, suddenly struck with extreme deafness, "that
                  the sunny South offers peace to the whole country, and will shortly be prepared
                  (in consideration of a few rations and six moths' credit for female wearing
                  apparel), to recognize the North as equals."</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>It rained drearily as Captain Villiam Brown and I set out to overtake the conic
                  section of the Mackerel Brigade, already on its march for the railway station; and
                  as the great drops drove each other through my clothing, I earnestly for at least
                  as much pardon in tumbler as would refract a spoon. I mentioned as much to

               <p>"Pardons, my fren', as there is no bar to them in this sunny clime, and as they
                  seem to be dispensed in accordance with the lick 'er law—Ah!" says Villiam,
                  pausing suddenly, "what's this?"</p>
               <p>It was a miserably dilapidated roadside house, through the windows of which feeble
                  light and the voiced of men singing came out upon then thickening darkness of the
                  night. Moving softly to the half-open door, we looked in, and beheld many members
                  of the freed-negro race kneeling, in the wretched room, around the figure of a
                  one-armed sable soldier of the Union, who, holding a lighted tallow candle in his
                  only hand, beat time with it to the supplication all were singing. Here and there
                  in the kneeling congregation appeared the blue uniform which, in every<pb
                     n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7328-00000135"/> other attitude than that, had stood out
                  a score of times in the red flash of battle; and, as the voices of homely praise
                  and prayer went up to Him who no less gave blackness to the raven than whiteness
                  to the goose, I thought it was fitting that the light, in its intoning rise and
                  fall, should alternately call from the shadows of a far corner and restore to them
                  again the bust of ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</p>

                     <p>OPENING ARGUMENT OF MANAGER, THE HON. B. F. BUTLER, IN THE HIGH COURT OF
                        IMPEACHEMENT, MONDAY, MARCH 30, 1868.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE:—The onerous duty has fallen to my
                     fortune to present to you, imperfectly as I must, the several propositions of
                     fact and the law upon which the House of Representatives will endeavor to
                     sustain the cause of the people against the President of the United States, now
                     pending at your bar.</p>
                  <p>The high station of the accused, the novelty of the proceeding, the gravity of
                     the business, the importance of the questions to be presented to your
                     adjudication, the possible momentous result of the issues, each and all must
                     plead for me to claim your attention for as long a time as your patience may
                     endure.</p>
                  <p>Now, for the first time in the history of the world, has a nation brought
                     before its highest tirbunal its chief executive magistrate for trial and
                     possible deposition from office, upon charges of maladministration of the
                     powers and duties of that office, In other times, and in other lands, it has
                     been found that despotisms could only be tempered by assassination, and nations
                     living under constitutional governments even, have found no mode by which to
                        rid<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7328-00000137"/> themselves of a tyrannical,
                     imbecile, or faithless ruler, save by overturning the very foundation and
                     framework of the government itself. And, but recently, in one of the most
                     civilized and powerful governments of the world, from which our own
                     institutions have been largely modelled, we have seen a nation submit for years
                     to the rule of an insane king, because its constitution contained no method for
                     his removal.</p>
                  <p>Our fathers, more wisely, founding our government, have provided for such and
                     all similar exigencies a conservative, effectual, and practical remedy by the
                     constitutional provision that the "President, Vice-President, and all civil
                     officers of the United States <emph>shall</emph> be removed from office on
                     impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery or other high crimes and
                     misdemeanors." The Constitution left nothing to implication, either as to the
                     persons upon, whom, or the body by whom, or the tribunal before which, or the
                     offences for which, or the manner in which this high power should be exercised;
                     each and all are provided for by express words of imperative command.</p>
                  <milestone n=".   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   ." unit="typography"/>
                  <p>But a single incident only of the business was left to construction, and that
                     concerns the offences or incapacities which are the groundwork of impeachment.
                     This was wisely done, because human foresight is inadequate, and human
                     intelligence fails in the task of anticipating and providing for, by positive
                     enactment, all the infinite gradations of human wrong and sin, by which the
                     liberties of a people and the safety of a nation may be endangered from the
                     imbecility, corruption, and unhallowed ambition of its rulers,</p>
                  <p>It may not be uninstructive to observe that the framers of the Constitution,
                     while engaged in their glorious and, I trust, ever-enduring work, had their
                     attention aroused and their minds quickened most signally upon this very topic.
                     In the previous year only Mr. Burke, from his place in the House of Commons in
                     England had preferred charges for impeachment against Warren Hastings, and
                     three days before our convention sat he was impeached at the bar of the House
                     of Lords for misbehavior in office as the ruler of a people whose numbers were
                     counted by millions, The mails were then bringing across the Atlantic week by
                     week the eloquent accusations of Burke, the gorgeous and burning denunciations
                     of Sheridan, in behalf of the oppressed people of India, against one who had
                     wielded over them more than regal power. May it not have been that the trial
                     then in progress was the determining cause why the framers of the Constitution
                     left the description of offences because of which the conduct of an officer
                     might be inquired of to be defined by the laws and usages of Parliament as
                     found in the precedents of the mother country with which our fathers were as
                     familiar we are with our own?</p>
                  <p>In the light, therefore, of these precedents, the question arises, <emph>What
                        are impeachable offences</emph> under the provisions of our Constitution? .
                     . . . . .</p>
                  <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7328-00000138"/>
                  <p>I pray leave to lay before you, at the close of my argument, a brief of all the
                     precedents and authorities upon this subject, in both countries, for which I am
                     indebted to the exhaustive and learned labors of my friend, the honorable
                     William Lawrence, of Ohio, member of the Judiciary Committee of the House of
                     Representatives, in which I fully concur and which I adopt.</p>
                  <p>We define, therefore, an impeachable high crime or misdemeanor to be <emph>one
                        in its nature or consequences subversive of some fundamental or essential
                        principle of government, or highly prejudicial to the public interest, and
                        this may consist of a violation of the constitution, of law, of an official
                        oath, or of duty, by an act committed or omitted, or, without violating a
                        positive law, by the abuse of discretionary powers from improper motives, or
                        from any improper purpose.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first criticism which will strike the mind a cursory examination of this
                     definition is, that some of the enumerated acts are not within the common-law
                     definition of crimes. . . . . . .</p>
                  <p>Mr. Christian, in his notes to the Commentaries of Blackstone, explains the
                     collocation and use of the words "high crimes and misdemeanors" by saying,—</p>
                  <p>"When the words 'high crimes and misdemeanors' are used in prosecutions by
                     impeachment, the words, 'high crimes' have no definite signification, but are
                     used merely to give greateer solemnity to the charge."</p>
                  <p>One of the important questions which meets us at the outset is: Is this
                     proceeding a trial, as that term is understood so far as relates to the rights
                     and duties of a court and jury upon an indictment for crime? Is it not rather
                     more in the nature of an inquest of office?</p>
                  <p>The Constitution seems to have determined it to be the latter, because, under
                     its provisions the right to retain and hold office is the only subject that can
                     be finally adjudicated: all preliminary inquiry being carried on solely to
                     determine the question and that alone. . .</p>
                  <p>A constitutional tribunal solely, you are bound by no law, either stature, or
                     common, which may limit your constitutional prerogative. You consult to
                     precedents save those of the law and custom of parliamentary bodies. You are a
                     law unto yourselves, bound only by the natural principles of equity and
                     justice, and that <foreign xml:lang="LAT">salus populi suprema est
                        lex.</foreign> . . . . . . .</p>
                  <p>The first eight articles set out in several distinct forms the acts of the
                     respondent in removing Mr. Stanton form office and appointing Mr. Themas
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ad interim,</foreign> differing in legal effect in
                     the purposes for which and the intent with which either or both of the acts
                     were done, and the legal duties and rights infringed, and the acts of Congress
                     violated in so doing. All the articles allege these acts to be in contravention
                     of his oath of office, and in disregard of the duties thereof. If they are so,
                     however, the President might have the power to do them under the law; still,
                     being so done, they are acts of official misconduct, and as we have seen,
                     impeachable. . . . . .</p>
                  <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7328-00000139"/>
                  <p>This, then, is the plain and inevitable issue before the Senate and the
                     American people: Has the President, under the Constitution, the more than
                     kingly prerogative at will to remove from office, and suspend from office
                     indefinitely, all executive officers of the United States, either civil,
                     military or naval, at any and all times, and fill the vacancies with creatures
                     of his own appointment, for his own purposes without any restraint whatever, or
                     possibility of restraint by the Senate or by Congress thorough laws duly
                     enacted? The House of Representatives, in behalf of the people, join this issue
                     by affirming that the exercise of such powers is a high misdemeanor in office.
                     If the affirmation is maintained by the respondent, then, so far as the first
                     eight articles are concerned,—the respondent must go, and ought to go, quit and
                     free. Therefore, by these articles and the answers thereto, the momentous
                     question, here and now, is raised whether the Presidential office itself (if it
                     has prerogatives and power claimed for it) ought, in fact, to exist as a part
                     of the constitutional government of a free people, while by the last three
                     articles the simpler and less important inquiry is to be determined, whether
                     Andrew Johnson has so conducted himself that he ought longer to hold any
                     constitutional office whatever. The latter sinks to merited insignificance
                     compared with the grandeur of the former. If that is sustained, then a right
                     and power hitherto unclaimed and unknown to the people of the country is
                     engrafted on the Constitution, most alarming in its extent, most corrupting in
                     its influence, most dangerous in its tendencies, and most tyrannical in its
                     exercise. Whoever therefore, votes "not guilty" on these articles, votes to
                     enchain our free institutions, and to prostrate them at the feet of any man who
                     being President, may choose to control them,</p>
                  <milestone n=".   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   ." unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Article ninth charges that Major-General Emory being in command of the military
                     department of Washington, the President called him before him and instructed
                     him that the act of March 2, 1867, which provides that all orders from the
                     President shall be issued through the General of the army, was intent to induce
                     Emory to take orders directly from himself, and thus hinder the execution of
                     the Civil Tenure act, and to prevent Mr. Stanton from holding his office of
                     Secretary of War. If the transaction set forth in this article stood alone, we
                     might well admit that doubts might arise as to the sufficiency of the proof.
                     But the surroundings are so pointed and significant might arise as to the
                     sufficiency of the proof. But the surroundings are so pointed and significant
                     as to leave no doubt on the mind of an impartial man as to the intents and
                     purposes of the President. . . . . Is it not a high misdemeanor for the
                     President to assume to instruct the officers of the army that the laws of
                     Congress are not to be obeyed? . . . . . .</p>
                  <p>Article ten alleges that, intending to set aside the rightful authority and
                     powers of Congress, and to bring into<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7328-00000140"
                     /> disgrace and contempt the Congress of the United States, and to destroy
                     confidence in and excite odium against Congress and its laws, he, Andrew
                     Johnson, President of the United States, made divers speeches set out therein
                     whereby he brought the office of President into contempt, ridicule, and
                     disgrace. . . . . .</p>
                  <p>It may be taken as an axiom in the affairs of nations that no usurper has ever
                     seized upon the legislature of his country until he has familiarized the people
                     with the possibility of so doing by vituperating and decrying it, Denunciatory
                     attacks upon the legislature have always preceded; slanderous abuse of the
                     individuals composing it has always accompanied a seizure by a despot of the
                     legislative power of a country. . . . .</p>
                  <p>The House of Representatives has done its duty. We has presented the facts in
                     the constitutional manner; we have brought the criminal to your bar, and demand
                     judgement at your hands for his so great crimes. . .</p>
                  <p>I speak, therefore, not the language of exaggeration, but the words of truth
                     and soberness, that the future political welfare and liberties of all men hang
                     trembling on the decision of the hour.</p>

                     General Thomas, and that he saw him, about the 7th of March, at a ball, and
                     told him that "the eyes of all Delaware" were upon him, and that he would be
                     expected to stand firm. General Thomas replied that in a day or two he would
                     "kick that fellow out;" by which the witness thought he referred to Mr.

                     speech made by President Johnson in Cleveland on the 3d of September, 1866. The
                     report made by this witness was made in long hand, and he was subjected to a
                     strict cross-examination as to his ability to report correctly by that method,
                     The witness said that the President was frequently interrupted by the cheers,

                        IMPEACHMENT, THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 1868.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE AND SENATORS:—I have been engaged in the practice of my
                     profession as a lawyer for the last twenty years, and I have, in the course of
                     my somewhat diversified professional life, argued cases involving life,
                     liberty, property, and character. I have prosecuted and defended every species
                     of crime known to law, from murder in the first degree down to simple assault;
                     but in rising to address you to-day I feel that all the cases in which I was
                     ever concerned sink into comparative insignificance when compared to this one;
                     and a painful sense of the magnitude of the case in which I am now engaged, and
                     of my inability to meet and to defend it as it should be defend, oppresses me
                     as I rise to address you. But I would humbly invoke the Great Disposer of
                     events to give me a mind to conceive, a heart to feel, and tongue to express
                     those words which should be proper and fitting on this great occasion.</p>

                  <p>If it is true as is alleged, that the President is guilty of all these
                     things,—if he be guilty of one tithe of the offences which have been imputed to
                     him in the opening argument, and which have been iterated and reiterated in the
                     argument of yesterday and to-day,—then I am willing to confess that he is <q>

                  <argument>
                     <p>DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SATURDAY, MAY 20, 1868, AS REPORTED
                        IN THE PAPERS OF THE DAY.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE letter of Mr. Washburne having been read by the clerk, Mr. Donnelly
                     remarked that he was certainly justified in the declarations he had made that
                     the annals of Congress presented no parallel to that letter, and he thought he
                     should establish that there were in that letter twenty three distinct
                     statements which were twenty-three distinct falsehoods. He should attempt to
                     deal with them as rapidly as possible. Mr. Donnelly went on to explain that he
                     had only received the draft of the bill on the 2d of March; that he had asked
                     leave to introduce it on the 20th; that Mr. Washburne had objected; that he
                     (Mr. Donnelly) had then gone to Connecticut to aid the Republican party in the
                     canvas in that State. He expressed his belief that the objection made by Mr.
                     Washburne had sprung from personal and malicious motives, and remarked that
                     that gentleman could not speak the truth when the truth would best serve his
                     purpose. Having referred to and examined<pb n="274-275"
                        xml:id="VAC7328-00000143"/> other points in Mr. Washburne's letter, Mr.
                     Donnelly went on to speak of Mr. Washburn, of Wisconsin, as "mousing around" in
                     reference to some other bill.</p>
                  <p>The SPEAKER interrupted, and said that that was not parliamentary language
                     toward a member who was absent, and who was not involved in the
                     controversy.</p>
                  <p>Mr. DONNELLY said he would withdraw the remark.</p>
                  <p>Mr. WASHBURNE (rep.), of Ill., expressed the hope that the party would be
                     allowed to go on.</p>
                  <p>Mr. DONNELLY after passing from that point, referred to the charge in Mr.
                     Washburne's letter that his (Mr. Donnelly's) opposition to the bill offered
                     some time since by Mr. Washburn, of Wisconsin, to reduce fares on the Pacific
                     Railroad might be attributed to the fact that he had never ridden over a mile
                     of the road, and did not expect to until it was completed from the Mississippi
                     to the Pacific. It would be a consolation then to know that this mighty work
                     had been resisted and opposed by every blatant, loud-voiced, big-breasted,
                     small-headed, bitter-hearted demagogue in all the land. (Laughter on both sides
                     of the chamber.) Referring to the charge made against him in Mr. Donnelly said,
                     "An official beggar!" and that from a gentleman bearing the name which he does!
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Et tu Brute!</foreign> "An official beggar!" Why,
                     Mr. Speaker, when I entered the State of Minnesota it was Democratic; when I
                     entered the country in which I live it was two to one Democratic. I asked no
                     office,—I expected none. But the charge comes from such a quarter that I cannot
                     fail to notice it. The gentleman's family are chronic office-beggars. They are
                     nothing if they are not in office. Out of office they are miserable, wretched,
                     God-forsaken,—as uncomfortable as that famous stump-tailed bull in fly-time.
                     (Laughter.) This whole trouble arises from the persistent determination of one
                     of the gentleman's family to sit in this body. Every young male of the
                     gentleman's family is born into the world with "M. C." franked on his broadest
                     part. (Laughter.) The great calamity seems to be that God in his infinite
                     wisdom did not make any of them broad enough to make room for "U. S. S."
                     (Laughter.) There was room for "U. S.," but the other S. slipped over and "U.
                     S. &amp; Co." is the firm. (Laughter.)</p>
                  <p>The SPEAKER interrupted Mr. Donnelly and reminded him that his language was
                     beyond the usual limit of parliamentary propriety.</p>
                  <p>Mr. WASHBURNE again expressed his desire that the "party" should be permitted
                     to go on.</p>
                  <p>Mr. DONNELLY said he was sorry to transgress the proper limits of debate, but
                     the House would perceive that the character of the letter on which he was
                     commenting made him speak under such feeling.</p>
                  <p>He has lowered by his wholesale, reckless assaults on the honor and character
                     of the members the standard of this body; he has furnished arguments for the
                     wit of Dan Rice;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7328-00000144"/> he has furnished
                     substance for the slanders of the pothouse. Mr. Speaker, I need enter into no
                     defence of the Fortieth Congress. In point of intellect, of devotion to the
                     public welfare, of integrity, of personal character, it will compare favorably
                     with any Congress that ever sat since the foundation of the government. It is
                     illustrated by names that would do honor to any nation in any age of the world.
                     If there be in our midst one low, sordid, vulgar soul,—one barren of mediocre
                     intelligence,—one heart callous to every kindly sentiment and to every generous
                     emotion,—one tongue leprous with slander,—one mouth which is like unto a den of
                     foul beasts, giving forth deadly odors,—if there be here one character which,
                     while blotched and spotted, yet raves and rants, and blackguards like a
                     prostitute,—if there be here one bold, bad, empty, bellowing demagogue, it is
                     the gentleman from Illinois. . . . . . .</p>
                  <p>Mr. WASHBURNE said: During my entire time of service in this House I have never
                     asked leave to make a personal explanation, and I never expect to. The party
                     from Minnesota has had the letter which I wrote to a gentleman in that State
                     read to the House, and it goes upon the records of the House and on the records
                     of the country, and there it will remain for all time. Every assertion made in
                     that letter is true, and whoever says it is not true states what is false. If I
                     were called upon—and I desire only to say that if I, under any operation of
                     circumstances, were ever called upon,—to make a personal explanation in reply
                     to a member, it would not be to a member who had committed a crime; it would
                     not be to a member who had run away; it would not be to a member who had
                     changed his name; it would not be to a member whose whole record in this House
                     is covered with venality, corruption, and crime.</p>
                  <p>The SPEAKER reminded the gentleman that his remarks were not parliamentary,
                     etc., etc.</p>
                  <p>Finaly, a committee was appointed to investigate the charges made in Mr.
                     Washburne's letter, and Mr. Donnelly informed the members, that, if it were not
                     unparliamentary, he would ask them all to take a drink!</p>

            <p>"——with all the highly-wrought interest of sensational fiction, yet with a delicacy
               that remains unsullied by associations an inferior writer would have avoided as the
               only means of preserving the purity of his pages, the story leads us through a
               diversity of scenes which the keen observation and educated eye of the artist alone
               could put before us—the foibles of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nouveaux
                  riches;</foreign> of the shopkeeping and political aristocracy of New York; the
               penetralia of Bohemia, of the Albany lobby and the Fire Points: of the theatres and
               newspaper offices and gambling hells of the city; the parlors of refinement and
               wealth, and of rich vulgarity; vice in purple and fine linen about the green cloth,
               and vice in squalor and nakedness in the groggeries of Cow Bay; knavery of high and
               low degree—a phantasmagoric view of metropolitan life, with such resources of the
               incongruous, grotesque, and pitiful, of hilarity and tenderness, as even Mr. Dickens
               has not more strikingly merged. And it is difficult to determine wherein the author's
               power is greatest. His constructive skill, his dramatic effect, his satirical
               insight, his fervid descriptions of scenes of grandeur and of horror, his humor, wit,
               pathos, the depths of passion, of sympathy, even of tenderness,—the combination of
               these attests a more universal genius, a large nature, than we supposed was to be
               found among American novelists."</p>
            <p>It is the work of the ripe intellect, and to it the author has given his maturest
               powers, and his long, unwearied labor. We welcome it to a high place in our permanent
               literature, and recognize it as one of the very ablest novels that the last decade
               has produced.—<title>N. Y. Citizen.</title>
            </p>
            <p>We have determined to read it, for the reason that no "puff" of the book has yet
               appeared in print, notwithstanding the fact that the author's position as a
               journalist affords him unusual opportunites for securing favorable mention of his
               book by the press.—<title>N. Y. Com. Advertiser.</title>
            </p>
            <p>In some parts it is worthy of Dickens, or Wilkie Collins, or of Anthony
                  Trollope.—<title>Memphis Avalanche.</title>
            </p>
            <p>As a satirist, the author reminds us of Addison. His satire is keen without
               malevolence, and witty without spleen. As an interpreter of the language of action,
               tone, and gesture, he is equalled only by Dickens.—<title>Rochester Union.</title>
            </p>
            <p>To Mr. Newel (Orpheus C. Kerr) we unhesitatingly accord a place second to no other
               American novelist, and there are few upon the other side of the water who is one work

               unable to pray, gives vent to his agonized feelings in a feebly attempt to trill our
               a few lines of hymn—possibly the last fleeting reminiscence of an innocent
               childhood—and his fellow Bohemians, one with a dog on his lap, another with a violin
               in his fingers, and a third with a pack of cards half out of his pocket, humbly and
               solemnly joining in the strain—has for depth of feeling and grotesquencess scarce an
               equal in the whole range of English literature.—<title>Trubner's (London) Literary

            <head>THE ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS.</head>
            <head type="sub">FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD SERIES.</head>
            <p>3 VOLS. 12mo. CLOTH. PRICE $1.50 EACH.</p>
            <p>These inimitable specimens of American Wit and Humor may be justly spoken of as
               world-renowned; for, in addition to their sale of upwards of fifty thousand copies in
               this country, there have been no less than four rival editions of them published in
               England. The following extracts from genuine criticisms show that the "PAPERS" enjoy
               the hearty commendation of the <emph>highest critical authorities</emph> in either
               country.</p>
            <p>
               <title>From the London Athenæum, in a three-column review.</title>
            </p>
            <p>"We opened his ('Orpheus C. Kerr's') volume with some misgiving, some dread lest
               wrong should be done to the honest who survived, or the brave who have gone down on
               either side in the great American struggle. We speedily, however, found ourselves
               reassured. Mr. Newell has, perhaps, an occasional hard hit at the Southerners; but,
               taken altogether, he is pretty impartial, and scatters his jokes wherever he finds
               anything that can justify him in flinging them about. The weaknesses, follies,
               eccentricities, blunderings and vices of human nature, as exhibited by the smaller
               men in the late great struggle, are fair game for him, and probably no men will laugh
               more sincerely than those at whom Mr. Newell laughs most loudly himself. In short, he
               makes mirth out of that which affords so much food for mirth, in similar
               circumstances, here at home. For prose, rhymes, parodies, and some good common sense
               uttered under the mask of satire, this volume may be commended to the notice of all
               holiday-makers this Christmas tide."</p>
            <p>The great success of the volumes of burlesque war-correspondence by "Orpheus C. Kerr"
               (Robert H. Newell) has placed him at the head of American humorists. Yet it would be
               doing him injustice to consider him as a mere jester. He is, rather, a keen satirist,
               who used wit as the means of giving greater force to criticisms just and needful, and
               wider currency to thoughts of weight and value.—<title>New York Independent.</title>
            </p>
            <p>He seizes the acme of the ludicrous as directly as Crockett himself.—<title>Round
                  Table.</title>
            </p>
            <p>The writer of the "Orpheus C. Kerr Papers" has struck an original vein of humor, and
               works it with decided effect.—<title>New York Evening Post.</title>
            </p>
            <p>The reader enjoys the vein of the author with a feeling akin to that with which the
               public revelled in the Pickwick papers when they first appeared.—<title>Wilkes'
                  Spirit.</title>
            </p>
            <p>We have laughed over some of Orpheus's letters until our sides ached with the
               pleasant emotion. Their wit and humor were so original and racy, and their broad
               burlesque so queer and good-natured, that we laughed even when we wished to be sober
               and serious.—<title>Providence Journal.</title>
            </p>
            <p>This humorous historian of the War ranks highest amongst the wits and satirists of
               America, and, since Thackeray died. has no living rival in the realm of English
               humorous literature.—<title>California Golden Era.</title>
            </p>
            <p>It is noticeable, too, that this author's eccentricities never degenerate into
               "slang;" his wit is always that of a scholar, and his satire that of a
                  gentleman.—<title>New York Leader.</title>

            <p>They (the "Papers") stir one up as carbonic acid gas will. They pull our sides out
               into jovial convexity.—<title>Milwaukie Sentinel.</title>
            </p>
            <p>Although they take a professedly comic view of men and things, the reader will detect
               an undercurrent of deep thought and even sorrowful reflection on the great events of
               the day, which render tem particularly attractive suggestive.—<title>New York
                  Sun.</title>
            </p>
            <p>Among the good effects of late war in America is the intercourse—social and
               intellectual—which it has promoted between the United States and England. This is
               abundantly proved by the quantity of American books of humor—for the most part in
               blazing red or yellow covers—which stare us in the face in all the booksellers'
               windows. Some are good; some bad. The good ones—including the "Bigelow Papers," the
               "Autocrat of the Breakfast Table," Artemus Ward, and the "Orpheus C. Kerr Papers"—are
                  <emph>very</emph> good.—<title>London Star.</title> "Literature of 1865."</p>
