ENTERED according to Act of Congress, in the year 1862,&#xD;

In the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the southern District of New York.&#xD;
FILMER &amp;amp; CO.,&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER 1.&#xD;
Two persons were seated in the bow-window of&#xD;
a beautiful little boudoir, which was situated in&#xD;
the second story of a tower corner in a quaint,&#xD;
odd-fashioned, but massive and costly building&#xD;
in Boston, which, standing upon one of the&#xD;
highest spots in the city, enabled the occu-&#xD;
pants of the room to look over the house-tops'&#xD;
into the harbor beyond.&#xD;
One-of course, the sex has the preference-&#xD;
was a lady of not more than nineteen or twenty&#xD;
years of age, tall, finely formed, with a full de-&#xD;
velopment of figure. Her features, as well as&#xD;
her black, flashing eye, denoted great strength of&#xD;
character. But now her face was pale, andfrom&#xD;
her great dark eyes tears came slowly welling&#xD;
out, and, dropping from beneath the jeweled&#xD;
hand which pressed her forehead, betrayed that&#xD;
grief was making furrows in her heart.&#xD;
By her side, dressed in the uniform of a gal-'&#xD;
lant volunteer regiment, stood one whose simi-&#xD;
larity of feature at once betrayed his relation-&#xD;
ship. His heutenant's uniform well became his&#xD;
figure, slight and boyish as it was-for he was&#xD;
but eighteen.&#xD;
Reader, become acquainted with Miss Fluta&#xD;
Winchester and her brother, Elmer. They are&#xD;
the only children of one of the most wealthy&#xD;
men-if not the wealthiest man-in all New&#xD;
England. His idols, too ; for their mother has&#xD;
passed away, and he has naught else to love-&#xD;
for, wealthy though he is, lie is not a gold-wor-&#xD;
shiper. Educated, not. in a college or a fash-&#xD;
ionable seminary, where vice is as readily learn-&#xD;
ed as virtue - more readily, in truth - but at&#xD;
home, by private tutors, who have devoted time&#xD;
and talents in preparing their minds for the&#xD;
world struggle of life, they are both possessed&#xD;
of far more than the ordinary accomplishments&#xD;
of persons of their age.&#xD;
When Fort Sumter fell, and the President&#xD;
called for aid from the loyal States to punish&#xD;
treason, Eluier Winchester Went to his father-&#xD;
&#xD;
who had long before retired from business-and&#xD;
asked his permission to volunteer his services as&#xD;
a soldier of the State.&#xD;
The face of the old gentleman paled when his&#xD;
boy made the request. There was good blood&#xD;
in his veins. His father and grandfather had&#xD;
both fought under the banned of Washington.&#xD;
The grandsire's bones lay mouldering under the&#xD;
ungrateful soil of South Carolina-for lie fell at&#xD;
Camden.&#xD;
"There are thousands, yes, tens of thousands,&#xD;
who will spring to arms Mader the governor's&#xD;
call, who are not situated as you are, iy son,"&#xD;
said Mr. Winchester. "Why do you feel so&#xD;
anxious to leave me in n~y old age ? 1 have&#xD;
none but you and your sister left ; and were you&#xD;
to fall on the battle-field, we would be desolate&#xD;
indeed."&#xD;
"I have thought of that, father, and also of&#xD;
your oft-repeated words: 'Providence is with&#xD;
us always.' I may go, win a proud name, serve&#xD;
the country you first taught me how to love, and&#xD;
yet come hack to gladden your eye and cheer&#xD;
your latter years!" replied the ardent boy.&#xD;
"Remembei, father, the stock we spring from.&#xD;
Revolutionary sires must not find recreant sons&#xD;
in this day. We must not leave the battles for&#xD;
our nation's flag to be fought by the Celt, the&#xD;
Teuton, or the sons of the Emerald Isle alone."&#xD;
True, my son-true. I admire your spirit&#xD;
while I shall have to mourn your absence. But&#xD;
you have no military education. Nor anticipating&#xD;
this fearful crisis, I have neglected that point."&#xD;
" Why, father, there is not a better swords-&#xD;
man in this city than I. As a shot, both with&#xD;
the pistol and rifle, I excel."&#xD;
"And yet of the soldier's drill, the movements&#xD;
of a company, or field evolutions, you know&#xD;
nothing. You must at once procure books and&#xD;
a competent instructor, put yourself in train-&#xD;
ing, and when you are fitted for an officer's&#xD;
position, I will not check your patriotic desire to&#xD;
serve your country."&#xD;

" Thank you, dear father - a thousand I cheeks, and even up to the brow, of the fair girl,&#xD;
thanks !"                                  when her brother mentioned the name of Will&#xD;
This conversation took place only six weeks Ashton, told that she was interested in him who&#xD;
before the day upon which this chapter opens. bore it. She was betrothed to him.&#xD;
And Elmer Winchester was not only a lieuten-  " I must go over and see Will, right away,"&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
In the double parlors of Mr. Winchester',&#xD;
grand, old mansion, there was a large and bril&#xD;
lientparty assem bled on the evening of the day&#xD;
which opens our story. They were friends of&#xD;
the fmil   whom Mr.inehester hadrinvited&#xD;
to spend a cheerful hour with Elmer before lie&#xD;
departed for the soat of war. There were old&#xD;
plan      young, all of tie first-class; for neo&#xD;
more aristocratic family than that of Mr. Win&#xD;
chester bore a coat-of arms uponits carriage.&#xD;
oiael in the modern Atsens. Several volunteer&#xD;
olhee.s were present, in their new and untar-&#xD;
rslied uniforms.  And others were there, whose&#xD;
,    rozedfaces, and uniforms not quite so new told&#xD;
of service - service on our tempestuous sea-&#xD;
board, or far awa tipon the frontiers, or bacl;&#xD;
.among the prairies, or in tihe depths of the&#xD;
Western forests. Even by their carriage and&#xD;
stalwart, upright forms Couldvon tell the regu-&#xD;
1 ir, hardened'in service, from him who had but&#xD;
just enlterd it, to become a soldier, if the mettle&#xD;
was in him.&#xD;
In one parlor there was music, and, of course,&#xD;
as the yong folk- gathrel there, dancing en-&#xD;
sued. [a tie other, carl-tables were plenty,&#xD;
- and ancient dames and venerable gentlemen en-&#xD;
jyed that most indispensable and innocent&#xD;
source of Bostonian amusement, Whist!" And,&#xD;
noiselessly, liveried servants  passed around&#xD;
from time to time, bearmg upon silver waiters&#xD;
tea, coffee, lemonade, cake, and fruit, to stay the&#xD;
appetite of the guests until thu more solid sup-&#xD;
per, which at a late hour' would preface their&#xD;
departure, could be pre ared.&#xD;
It was after tea of he clock---in truth, near&#xD;
eleven, when it would scm that all guests in-&#xD;
tending to coie woud inave arrived-when a&#xD;
.  tall, splendidly-formed, and  most decidedly&#xD;
handsome man, of not more than thirty years of&#xD;
age, entered the front rier. His dark, glossy&#xD;
hair and beard, his brunette complexion, and his&#xD;
jet-black eye, all proclaimed his Southern ori-&#xD;
gin ; while a bold and nsy carriage, and a free,&#xD;
confident manner made hin look the officer, al-&#xD;
&#xD;
though he was dressed entirely in citizen's garb&#xD;
-~-not even a button giving a sign that heheld&#xD;
an official position.&#xD;
He bowed low to Mr. Winchester as he ad-&#xD;
vanced ; and the latter seeing him, sprang up&#xD;
from the whist-table at which he was engaged,&#xD;
and, reaching out his hand, shook that of the&#xD;
young man heartily, as hie cried :&#xD;
"Will, my boy, I am glad to see you! Wel-&#xD;
come home from the sea again! .I heard your&#xD;
vessel was in, and sent a note of invitation right&#xD;
e away.&#xD;
e "Which I received early, sir," said Lieuten-&#xD;
- ant Aihton ; "but I had seine important duties to&#xD;
e perform which much belated ile."&#xD;
" Well, well, better late than never, my boy !&#xD;
e Have you seen Fluta dr Elmer yet ?"&#xD;
"No, sir; I have but this moment arrived."&#xD;
"Well, we must hunt theu up. Mr. Flagg,&#xD;
s will you be so good as to take my hand in the&#xD;
- game of whist ? Thank you. Now, Will, we&#xD;
will go and take a glass of wine, and then we'll&#xD;
f hunt up Fluta and Elmer. They're inthe dane-&#xD;
ing-room. Will is in uniform, and to-morrow&#xD;
he is off with his regiment for the seat of war!"&#xD;
"Surely, you do not mean to let him engage&#xD;
in this fratricidal contest!" exclaimed Ashton&#xD;
- "He is but aboy yet !"&#xD;
-   " Don't tell him that !"~said Mr. Winchester.&#xD;
Why, he has a moustache three-tenths of an&#xD;
- inch long, and in uniform he looks quite sol-&#xD;
dierly! But here we are at the wine-closet.&#xD;
I What will you have--port, sherry, Madeira, Ca-&#xD;
tawba, or Green-seal !"&#xD;
"A glass of Madeira, if su please," said&#xD;
Ashtoin, knowing it to be the old gentleman 's&#xD;
favorite wine, and consequently the best in his&#xD;
cellar. " By theway,sir," lie added, " I brought&#xD;
you home a few dozen fkon the Island of Ma-&#xD;
deira, that has been kept there for nearly a&#xD;
hundred years. It was owned by an old miser,&#xD;
who died while-our ship was in port; and I bid&#xD;
it off at an auction of his effects. I will have&#xD;
it sent over in the morning.'&#xD;
"Thank you, my boy. You are very kind,&#xD;

And having emptied a couple of glasses of&#xD;
wine, the old gentleman drew Ashton's arm&#xD;
within his, and started for the room where the&#xD;
youngest and gayest of the party were dancing.&#xD;
In a few moments they found Fluta, who was&#xD;
not dancing, but was seated in a corner of the&#xD;
room, looking rather sad than gay.&#xD;
Here's Will, just home t'roi sea, FlutLa !"&#xD;
said her father, as he hurried up to her side.&#xD;
I am glad to see Mr. Ashton," she said, as&#xD;
she rose, and extended her hand. But her man-&#xD;
ner was evidently constrained: it was n t her&#xD;
old wa.y of welcoming him.&#xD;

"Then let us sit down and wait for Fluta-&#xD;

of course, remain here to-night, so as to see me&#xD;
off in the morning. I start for Washington at&#xD;
seven o'clock."&#xD;
"I am sorry, Elmer--very sorry !"&#xD;
"Why? I am sure that the position of first-&#xD;
lieutenant in a splendid regiment is a proud post&#xD;
for a boy of my age."&#xD;
" The position is good," said Ashton, " but&#xD;
the thought of fighting against one's own coun-&#xD;
tryn isterrible 1"&#xD;
"When they ignore our flag, defy the best&#xD;
government in the woi-ld, and trample upon the&#xD;
Constitution which their fathers, as well as ours,&#xD;
gave to us, they cease to deserve the name of&#xD;
country men. Rebels and traitors-worse than&#xD;
Arnolds---they must be subdued, and I am but&#xD;
too glad that I am to have a hand in their sub-&#xD;
jection. But why are you not in uniform, Will?&#xD;
You look like a parson in that black suit."&#xD;
"I am not entitled to wear a uniform," said&#xD;
Ashton, nervously. "I have resigned my com-&#xD;
mission in the service of the United States !"&#xD;
"Resigned ?" exclaimed Elmer, in astonish-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
" Resigned ?" echoed his father, who had&#xD;
come up just in time to hear the words which&#xD;
Ashton had spoken.&#xD;
"Yes, resigned !" said Ashton, with almost&#xD;
desperate bitterness. "Do you think I'd re-&#xD;
main in the service to fight against the people&#xD;
of my own Southern land for all the cursed&#xD;
Yankees that ever lived ?"&#xD;
And almost wild in his excitement, the cx-&#xD;
lieutenant rose to his feet and rushed from the&#xD;
house, without uttering another word or waiting&#xD;
to hear one.&#xD;
"He must be drunk, or crazy !" muttered&#xD;
Mr. Winchester.&#xD;
".He has exhibited his colors in time," said&#xD;
Elmer. "tow I know why Fluta is absent.&#xD;
I'll warrant that he has expressed his secession&#xD;
principles to her; and much as she has loved&#xD;
him, the brave, true girl has left his side in&#xD;
scorn! But excuse me, father ; I must attend&#xD;
to our fair guests, for thismay be the last chance&#xD;
that I shall have to exhibit the kind of gallantry&#xD;
which they stand in need of to-night."&#xD;
And the young lieutenant hastened to take a&#xD;
partner for the "Lancers."&#xD;

, waves pro  ly in the centre, and the music of a&#xD;
e full-band rolls along upon the full wave of the&#xD;
t fresh, morning air.&#xD;
Still as so many statues carved from lifeless&#xD;
stone they stand, their arms at "present" until,&#xD;
the review over, the governor rides to the front&#xD;
t centre.&#xD;
Then, in clear, ringing tones from their col-&#xD;
tnel, come the orders:-reo0&#xD;
-   "Shoulder arms!     Order arms!    Parade&#xD;
rest!"&#xD;
As if they were but one iron-linked machine,&#xD;
each hand and weapon move at the same sec-&#xD;
ond, and at "rest" they stand as motionlessas&#xD;
before.&#xD;
The governor addresses them.' His words are&#xD;
but few, but they are to the point.&#xD;
"Go, fellow-citizens," he says "remembering&#xD;
that you depart from the vicinity of Bunker&#xD;
Hill, of Concord, and of Lexington. Go, re-&#xD;
membering the deeds of your patriot sires, and&#xD;
emulate them. Go, bearing the flag of your&#xD;
native land, and the banner of your State.&#xD;
Come not back without them. Go, and God's&#xD;
blessing go with you, for yours is a holy cause.&#xD;
You are sent to crush rebellion, and to conquer&#xD;
that best of all things-an honorable peace!"&#xD;
The governor ceased. But for a moment was&#xD;
there silence. It seemed as if that moment&#xD;
was spent in drinking in the weight of words&#xD;
which had come from the gubernatorial lips.&#xD;
Then arose a shout from those thousand throats&#xD;
that sounded far and near, and went up in roll-&#xD;
ing echoes toward the cloudless sky. Cheer af-&#xD;
ter cheer, the crash of martial music, and the&#xD;
boom of cannon firing the, parting salute, and&#xD;
the review was over.&#xD;
Companies were formed in platoons, from pla-&#xD;

ters, wives, mothers, and sweethearts, they&#xD;
.marched to the waiting train of cars, which was&#xD;
to hurry them away to the field of glory or of&#xD;
death.&#xD;
Now, for Scene the Second. Pacing to and&#xD;
fro in a large and spacious room in the Revere&#xD;
House, his eyes red with watching and the effect&#xD;

"What proposition have you to make ?" asked&#xD;
Ashtcn, beginning to be amused at the oddity of&#xD;
his visitor.&#xD;
" That's it! Now you're coming' to buisiness !"&#xD;
said Mr. Snaggs. "The long and the short of&#xD;
it is this :;1 was agoin' on the coast for a cargo&#xD;
of niggers, when this cussed war broke out. I'd&#xD;
just got a clipper brig built of four hundred ton,&#xD;
that can out-sail all creation. She's-all provis-&#xD;
ioned-got water aboard, and one long forty.-two&#xD;
and six thirty-two pound carronades in her hold&#xD;
ready for mounting. When I heard that the&#xD;
Southern chaps were agoin' to fit out privateers,&#xD;
I got to thinkin' there was more money to be&#xD;
made at that than there was a martin' niggers to&#xD;
Cuba, runnin' the risk o' gett in' catched, and all&#xD;
that. So I sent to old Jeff Davis for a letter o'&#xD;
-arque and a flag; and here they be."&#xD;
And Iehabod Snaggs drew a good-sized seces-&#xD;
sion flag out from under his vest with one hand,&#xD;
and the commission of a privateer from his&#xD;
pocket, with the other.&#xD;
"There !" said he, as he displayed these arti-&#xD;
eles-" you see how I'm fixed. All I want now is,&#xD;
a capting that understands using big guns, hand-&#xD;
hn' a vessel in a fight, and has got spunk&#xD;
enough to fight for a fortune for him and me.&#xD;
If you're the man, jast say so, and come aboard&#xD;
the 'Rattlesnake' as soon as you like."&#xD;
"Is that the name of your brig ?" asked Ash-&#xD;
ton, thinking of the slur in the paper.&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
" Very well. If a good crew can be shipped,&#xD;
I'll go. My command must be supreme, though,&#xD;
for I'll make her the terror of the seas !"&#xD;
"That's the sort ! I'll go as supercargo, and&#xD;
you shall have all to say aboard. When can&#xD;
you move, capting?"&#xD;
"Right away. The sooner the better. But&#xD;
I must first overhaul her thoroughly to see that&#xD;
she has arms enough of the best quality, plenty&#xD;
of ammunition, and is well found in every re-&#xD;
spect."&#xD;
"That's all right and proper, and anything&#xD;
that's wantin' shall be supplied, for I've got&#xD;
plenty of rocks," said Mr. Snaggs. " We'll ar-&#xD;
range about shares, and all that, as soon as you&#xD;
come aboard. And as you may need more&#xD;
instruments than I've got, and an outfit, you'd&#xD;
better take a couple of these five-hundred-dol-&#xD;
lar bills and use 'em. You needn't be backward&#xD;
-you see I've more of the same sort left."&#xD;
And Mr. Snaggs took two five-hundred-dollar&#xD;
bank-notes from a well-filled, greasy-.looking&#xD;
pocket-book, and handed them to Ashton.&#xD;
" Where does your brig lie ?" asked Ashton.&#xD;
"In the slip next above the India wharf. I've&#xD;
got her put up for St. Thomas, to blind the Cus-&#xD;
&#xD;
toms. I'm an old hand at dodgin' them, and do&#xD;
my work right under their noses. They don't&#xD;
suspect a feller there ; but if I was to fit out&#xD;
away up stream, or at some unknown old wharf,&#xD;
they'd pounce upon me like an Irishman on a&#xD;
boiled potato."&#xD;
"I'll be on board the brig a little after dusk&#xD;
this evening," said Ashton. "Meantime, you&#xD;
need not mention to any one, not even to your&#xD;
most intimate associates, who I am or where I&#xD;
come from. I can make a successful cruise. I&#xD;
know all the navy signals. I can easily fool&#xD;
their men-of-war for a while, and if we can take&#xD;
one or two California steamers, our fortunes are&#xD;
made."&#xD;
"That's so, by hokyI You're a trump, cap-&#xD;
ting-I can see that. - Excuse my manners, but&#xD;
I'm awful dry !"&#xD;
The latter part of, Mr. Snaggs' remarks were&#xD;
connected with his pouring out a glass of brandy&#xD;
from a decanter on the table, tad drinking it&#xD;
off.&#xD;
"Rather excuse me for not offering the liquor&#xD;
before," said Ashton. "I was careless."&#xD;
"Oh, never mind, capting ! I'm a great hand&#xD;
to help myself-never need much waitin' on&#xD;
where drink or provender is-in reach. But, bye-&#xD;
bye-I shall look for you at dusk&#xD;
And Mr. Snaggs, after securing his flag as&#xD;
before, and restoring his Jeff Davis document to&#xD;
its place, made a bow which would have shamed&#xD;
one of Barnum's trained bears, and retired.&#xD;
"The die is cast," said Ashton, when he was&#xD;
once more alone. "Privateer or pirate-about&#xD;
one and the same, but I am in for it. The day&#xD;
may not be very far away when I will persuade&#xD;
the haughty Miss Fluta to take a cruise with&#xD;
me. I can hate as well as love, if I know&#xD;
myself. I hope Elmer will be shot in the first&#xD;
engagement. Then she may alter her opinion&#xD;
about this war and its rights."&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
The "Rattlesnake" was indeed a model of&#xD;
maritime beauty. So thought William Ashton,&#xD;
as, in the twilight of a summer evening, he look-&#xD;
ed at her as she lay moored in the slip. Her&#xD;

"Why do you keep up such an incessant      "He joss has dat, Mrs'r Ich'bod !" said the&#xD;
whistling, Mr. Snaggs ?" asked Ashton, at his steward, who had popped his head up the cabin&#xD;
first moment of leisure.  -iacway in time to hear the last observation of&#xD;
"Cain' up a breeze, capting ---callin' up a Mr. Snaggs.&#xD;

it hadn t been for me, we'd have been in a dead second officer, whom he left in charge of the&#xD;
calm before now, with that cussed steamer to deck, " And if the wind freshens, take in sail -&#xD;
fight. I knew whistlin' would help us a heap ; we must be careful of our spars."&#xD;

"So I see!" replied Ashton, who was amused  With these directions given, Ashton went be-&#xD;

him the situation of a deputy in consequence of&#xD;
his evident good sense, and his knowledge of&#xD;
the character of various suspicious vessels in&#xD;

"I'm a million times obliged to ye, sir !" said&#xD;
Pat. "But there's an iday crapin' into the&#xD;

divil the bit do I know about sojerin'. I'm at&#xD;

all that, I'm after belavin' I'll be as awkward&#xD;

"You had better take my offer for a while,&#xD;
at least. Mr. Murdock," said the marshal.&#xD;
"Your pay will be good, your duties light, and&#xD;
a    you will have plenty of time to visit the city&#xD;
armories and drill-rooms, where you can look&#xD;
on and see the recruits drill, until you have&#xD;
learned enough to be a soldier, if you should&#xD;
still wish to go as such 1"&#xD;
"Your offer is mighty tempting , sir, as the&#xD;
bear said to the bee-hive that stood aforeninst&#xD;
him. But, sir, I might have to play traitor to&#xD;
some ould comrade that wants to go on a trip&#xD;
to the coast after nagurs."&#xD;
"I'll not ask you to look after slavers--but&#xD;
to look out for privateers," said the marshal&#xD;
"The success of the 'Rattlesnake,' in fitting&#xD;
out and getting to sea, will induce others to try&#xD;
the same thing ; for where there is money to be&#xD;
made, I am sorry to say my countrymen are&#xD;
not scrupulous as to the means they use to make&#xD;
it."t&#xD;
"Well, sir, I'll take your kind offer, on con-&#xD;
dition that, if I want to l'ave the office you'll&#xD;
let me do it, and not think me a deserter. For,&#xD;
if I do l'ave, it'll be to fight under the flag of&#xD;
the country that has befriended me antl more of&#xD;
my countrymen than there's left on the sod of&#xD;

"I'll make out your commission and assign&#xD;
you to duty right away," said the marshal,&#xD;
pleased with his new deputy.&#xD;
"The sooner the better, sir, as the red-headed&#xD;
gal said when her lover asked her when he'd&#xD;
marry him. I've only one favor to ask, sir"&#xD;
"What is that, Mr. Murdock?  If it is in my&#xD;
power to grant you any favor, you will not be&#xD;
likely to find a refusal."&#xD;
"If the 'Rattlesnake' was to be caught, her&#xD;
erew, owner, and officers would be treated as&#xD;
pirates-wouldn't they, sir?"&#xD;
"To be sure they would, Mr. Murdock!"&#xD;
"And hung, sir ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Of course ! That is the law, and our Govern-&#xD;
ment is too much in earnest to bear much tri-&#xD;
fling."&#xD;
"And you'd be the officer to execute the law,&#xD;
would'nt you,, sir ? And to execute the law&#xD;
would be to execute the prisoners.&#xD;
" Yes ; they would have to be hung by my-&#xD;
self, or a deputy."&#xD;
" Then, sir, the favor I'd ask is, if ould Snaggs&#xD;
is taken, that I may have the pleasure of windin'&#xD;
the rope about his long neck. When he's dane-&#xD;

the necessary papers to constitute the honest&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
When Captain Ashton went below into the&#xD;
cabin, after giving the course to his second offi-&#xD;
cer, he was somewhat surprised by observing a&#xD;
person emerging from the forward state-room&#xD;
whom he had not seen on board before. He&#xD;
was dressed in a seedy suit of black-his figure&#xD;
was tall and thin, a little stooping -his head&#xD;
was nearly bare of hair, his face thin, pale and&#xD;
-cadaverous. His nose was long and sharp, and&#xD;
turned up at the extreme end in a manner that&#xD;
seemed to say: "I'm on the smell all the time."&#xD;
"Who the deuce can he be ?" thought Ashton,&#xD;
as he paused at the foot of the companion-lad-&#xD;
der. "Not a-chaplain, for he wears no white-&#xD;
choker on his crane-like neck."&#xD;
Mr. Snaggs came to the rescue of his mental&#xD;
perplexity.&#xD;
" Capting Ashton," said he, "'low me to in-&#xD;
terduce to you our surgeon, Doctor Utubilicus.&#xD;
He's a reg'lar M. D., F. R. S., and has got diplo-&#xD;
mas enough on parchment to shoe the family of&#xD;
John Rogers, who got scorched at Springfield,&#xD;
or somewhere else in old times."&#xD;
Captain Ashton bowed, and Doctor Umbilieus&#xD;
bent over until the upper half of his lengthy&#xD;
body made a right angle with the lower part.&#xD;
But the doctor straightened in a hurry, for at&#xD;
that unfortunate moment Snowball, the steward,&#xD;
was entering the cabin with a pitcher of hot&#xD;
water to use in preparing Mr. Snaggs' " Jama-&#xD;
ky"; and his wooden leg happening to trip&#xD;
against the door-sill, he pitched forward, dis-&#xD;
charging the boiling water directly upon the&#xD;
most angular portion of the doctor's body.&#xD;
"Diabolus !" yelled the doctor, as he jumped&#xD;
up and down with his hands upon the seat of&#xD;
agony. "0 you black image of a Madagascar&#xD;
orang-outang ! you have ruined me. I shan't&#xD;
be able to sit down in a month."&#xD;
"Dc Lor' knows I didn't go for to do it, Mars'r&#xD;

with fright. " Dis darn ole wooden leg stub him&#xD;

&#xD;
" Oh-oh! Procure for me instanter a bottle&#xD;
of olive oleum !" groaned the doctor,&#xD;
" Oliveye hol'em ?" said the astonished darkey.&#xD;
" Yes, and haste ; the cuticle of my coxygis&#xD;
burneth with a heat like that of an oven !"&#xD;
"We've got brandy, and whisky, and rum,&#xD;
and wine, Mars'r Doctor; but I doesn't know&#xD;
nothing' 'bout the oliveye hole'um !"&#xD;
"Haven't you got any sweet-oil, you son of&#xD;
Pluto ?"&#xD;
-KOh yes Mars'r Doctor ! Lots of dat."&#xD;
4 "Then get me a bottle, or I'll jump down&#xD;
your throat !"&#xD;
Snowball hastened to obey, and the doctor&#xD;
retired to his state-room, from whence alternate&#xD;
groans and curses were heard for some time.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mr. Snaggs prepared the " Jama-&#xD;
ky," and soon both himself and Ashton had a&#xD;
brimming glass of" hot stuff" to their mouths.&#xD;
When the doctor came from his state-room in a&#xD;
more quiet manner, Mr. Snaggs asked him to&#xD;
"j'ine in."&#xD;
"Counter-irritants are excellent in their way,"&#xD;
said the doctor, as lie poured out a tumblerful&#xD;
and drank it off. "Aqua fervens is excellentin&#xD;
its proper place; but its application,upon the&#xD;
human body is not at all agreeable. Experien-&#xD;
tia docet !"&#xD;
And the doctor looked at Snowball with a&#xD;
malicious glance, which seemed to say, "only&#xD;
let me catch you sick, and I'll have revenge !"&#xD;
But he didn't say so. lie only said :&#xD;
"Steward, bring.me a couple of pillows from&#xD;
my room, and put them in this chair!"&#xD;
"Have you had much experience in surgery,&#xD;
doctor ?" asked Ashton.&#xD;
".Multum ! Or, as I should say in the vernc-&#xD;
ular, a great deal!" replied the doctor.  ' I&#xD;
graduated in Near York, served in hospitals&#xD;
there, then went to Ireland and attended Don-&#xD;
nybrook Fair, Tipperary, and other such places,&#xD;
for several years, to keep my hand in ; then&#xD;
went a voyage to the South Seas, got wrecked,&#xD;
and was for a long time chief-surgeon to Zou-a-&#xD;
whoo-whang-bee, the Emperor of the Cannibal&#xD;
Islands, where I should have been still, had it&#xD;
not been for a delicate affair which made it nec-&#xD;
essary for me to resign my position in haste,&#xD;
and to make a voyage for my health in one of&#xD;
his big war canoes, which I filled with cocoa-&#xD;
nuts and bread-fruit. My voyage nearly out-&#xD;
lasted my provisions ; but I was picked up,&#xD;
when existing on my last cocoa-nut, by a whaler,&#xD;
bound to New Bedford ; and as half her hands&#xD;
were down with the scurvy, had plenty of prac-&#xD;
tice on her, until I arrived once more on terra&#xD;
firma. Seeing an advertisement in the paper&#xD;
for a surgeon, I answered it, and found myself&#xD;
vis-a-vis with Mr. Snaggs, the advertiser, with&#xD;
whom I made an engagement. And here Iam&#xD;
my own first patient . '&#xD;

You ought to give the world a history of it !"&#xD;
said Ashton.&#xD;
"The Lord forbid !" said the doctor, solemn-&#xD;
ly. "My profession is bad enough. I would&#xD;
sooner end my fitful days with a dose of prussie&#xD;
acid or strychnia, than to become-an author I&#xD;
would rather endure to be an alderman or the&#xD;
member of a city council !"&#xD;
Snowball having prepared supper, the officers&#xD;
now dropped conversation for- a better use of&#xD;
their jaws.&#xD;

It may be the novelist's province, but most&#xD;
assuredly it is not his inclination, in this instance,&#xD;
to follow the gallant   th Regiment of Mas-&#xD;

will omit their ride by rail to Fall River-their&#xD;
tempestuous voyage over the raging Sound--&#xD;

tee of thp "Sons of Massachusetts," where the&#xD;
privates were feasted on beef and "common&#xD;
doin's," while the officers were taken over to the&#xD;

love to see "sogers," but don't like to be sogers !&#xD;
He will not even accompany then through the&#xD;

greet them, as they file out of the cars at the&#xD;
Washington depot; see them fall into column of&#xD;
march and move in a firm phalanx down to&#xD;
where Pennsylvania avenue butts its head against&#xD;
the Capitol grounds-thence along that broad&#xD;
avenue past the grand hotels, the grander faro-&#xD;
banks, the lager-beer saloons, and the other&#xD;
" attractions" of the seat of Government, until&#xD;
they reach the White hIouse, where they pass a&#xD;
review and tender al marching salute to the&#xD;
President of the United States. Then he will&#xD;
see them piled into the big, spare rooms of the&#xD;
new extension of'the Treasury building, where&#xD;
their stay will be brief, for there is work for&#xD;
tirn across the Potomac, and thither soon must&#xD;
they go.&#xD;
A week later-perhaps even a few days "over&#xD;
and above" a week. Near where the rebel Gen-&#xD;
eral Lee once held almost princely state on his&#xD;
heights of Arlington, you see a city of tents.&#xD;
In one of these, reclining on a blanket which is&#xD;
spread upon the ground, with a good-sized water-&#xD;
melon for a pillow, we find our friend Elmer&#xD;

&#xD;
20               THE RATTLESNAKE; OR,&#xD;
Winchester. The mail has just arrived in camp, I&#xD;
and his letters and the Boston papers absorb his&#xD;
attention. Several other officers are present-&#xD;
one siting on a camp-chest, another on a saddle,&#xD;
and others reclining on the bosom of Mother&#xD;
Earth.&#xD;
An exclamation of surprise, followed by a&#xD;
word or two which a pious mother would not&#xD;
have approved of, came from Elmer's lips.&#xD;
"What is the matter, lieutenant ?" asked his&#xD;
captain. "Anything going wrong at home '"&#xD;
" Not precisely at home. But what do you&#xD;
think. That Will Ashton, who was so near be-&#xD;
coming a brother-in-law of mine, but who show-&#xD;
ed his rebel colors in time to'save us from that&#xD;
disgrace, has fitted out a rebel privateer right&#xD;
under the nose of our " wide-awake" authorities,&#xD;
and roue to sea from Boston&#xD;
"The deuce! And was there no pursuit?"&#xD;
"Of course there was-when it was too late.&#xD;
I wish now that I was in a naval command, I'd&#xD;
chase that double traitor until I caught him  and&#xD;
when I did, I'd give him a dance beneath the&#xD;
yard-arm !"&#xD;
"No fear but that will be his doom at any&#xD;
rate !" said the captain. "Are you entirely&#xD;
awake, Mr. Winchester ?"&#xD;
" Yes, sir. But why do you ask ?"&#xD;
"I have been longing to share your    ow,&#xD;
as the old-maid said to a bachelor friend one&#xD;
leap-year."&#xD;
"1Pitch in captain," said Elmer, with a laugh,&#xD;
as he raised his head and rolled the huge water-&#xD;
melon out among the party, who instantly drew&#xD;
their knives upon the defenseless fruit. And&#xD;
soon the red, juicy slices were disappearing al-&#xD;
most as fast as pumpkin-pie would have gone&#xD;
had they been at homt, instead of there on the&#xD;
"sacred soil" of the Grand Mother of Presi-&#xD;
dents.&#xD;
But suddenly a sound fell upon their ears&#xD;
which started every man to his feet. It was the&#xD;
"long roll" of the drummers-the signal "to&#xD;
arms."&#xD;
A buckling on of swords, a belting of pistols,&#xD;
and in a minute more the tent was vacant. In&#xD;
three minutes more, the regiment was formed&#xD;
ready for the iiarch, or for service anywhere.&#xD;
So soon had raw recruits learned the duty of the&#xD;
soldier. Let foreign foes beware! When a half-&#xD;
miliion of armed volunteers spring into action&#xD;
in a few days' time to quell a domestic war, let&#xD;
them conceive how quickly two or three millions&#xD;
would arise to hurl back an invading fe, even&#xD;
as the sea-girt rock hurls back in frothy foam&#xD;
the mighty waves which roll up against its ada-&#xD;
manine battlements.&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
The cruise of the " Rattlesnake" was barren&#xD;
of interest, for full two weeks after she left the&#xD;
American coast. For Ashton, not wishing to&#xD;
get cruisers upon his track so soon, avoided&#xD;
&#xD;
THE'REBEL PRIVATEER.&#xD;
every sail which hove in sight, and occupied all&#xD;
of his time, except that allotted to meals and to&#xD;
sleep, in perfecting his crew in the use of their&#xD;
artillery and small-arms. He also had a daily&#xD;
school under one of his mates-a well-educated&#xD;
man-wherein the likeliest of the crew and the&#xD;
petty officers were instructed ii navigation, so&#xD;
as to fit them for future prize-masters.&#xD;
About fourteen days from the time when lie&#xD;
had last sighted land, he had the crew mustered&#xD;
aft ; and after complimening them upon their&#xD;
zeal and rapidity of improvement, he told them&#xD;
that lie now felt they knew their respective du-&#xD;
ties well enough to justify him in risking action&#xD;
whenever Fate threw a chalice in his way. He&#xD;
would make a prize of the very first vessel that&#xD;
hove in sight which wore the Stripes and Stars&#xD;
of the United States.&#xD;
The crew received this information with&#xD;
cheers of delight ; and even while their shouts&#xD;
rung out upon the " waste of waters," the look-&#xD;
out from aloft sung out: "Sail, ho!"&#xD;
"Where away?" asked Ashton.&#xD;
"Nearly dead-ahead, sir."&#xD;
"Can you make out her rig ?"&#xD;
"No, sir. She's no bigger than a gull's wing&#xD;
to the eye yet."&#xD;
"Report, if she lifts so that you can see which&#xD;
way she is standing."&#xD;
"Ay, ay, sir !"&#xD;
The brig was standing to the eastward under&#xD;
easy canvas with about an eight-knot breeze on&#xD;
the starboard beam. 'Her guns were all shot-&#xD;
ted, and the small-arms were in the racks ready&#xD;
for use.&#xD;
"Do we raise the strange sail any ?" asked&#xD;
Ashton, after waiting nearly a half-hour to hear&#xD;
from aloft&#xD;
"Yes, sir. We raise her fast. She seems to&#xD;
be a square-rig, and to be standing right for&#xD;
us."&#xD;
"Very well, keep your eye on her, and re-&#xD;
port when you can make out what she is," said&#xD;
Ashton. He then ordered the decks sanded&#xD;
down, the magazine opened, and every prepara-&#xD;
tion made for action.&#xD;
Doctor Umbilicus was sent to his station, and&#xD;
told to have his lint, bandages, andinstruments&#xD;
ready ; and Snowball was secretly ordered to&#xD;
have a good pail of grog ready to pass around,&#xD;
if a fight should happen to come off.&#xD;
Mr. Snaggs-determined to know as soon as&#xD;
any one what was coming-clambered up to the&#xD;
maintop-gallant cross-treeS with his spy-glass in&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
Ashton had just got the vessel and crew in&#xD;
perfect fighting trim, when Snaggs hailed him&#xD;
from aloft:&#xD;
"Cipting," said he, "if I'm any judge of&#xD;
water-craft, the vessel that's coming' down on us,&#xD;
bows on, is an American man-o'-war, and a two-&#xD;
decker at that."&#xD;
Ashton instantly had the Confederate flag&#xD;
&#xD;
hauled down, and the United States flag hoisted&#xD;
in its place. A man-of-war pendant was alto&#xD;
hoisted at the main truck. Then he went aloft,&#xD;
and taking the spy-glass from Snaggs, took a&#xD;
long and anxious look at the stranger.&#xD;
"You are right," he said, at last. "It must&#xD;
be the ' Cumb'erland ' coming home."&#xD;
"Then we'd better be sheering off," said Mr.&#xD;
Snaggs, in alarm.&#xD;
"Not at all, sir. I shall speak her," said&#xD;
Ashton, calmly.&#xD;
"Are you crazy, capting?" cried Mr. Snaggs.&#xD;
"Why, her broadside would sink us before we&#xD;
could repeat the Lord's Prayer!"&#xD;
"Yes; but she will not fire any. Were we&#xD;
to try to run away, she might outsail us - es-&#xD;
pecially if the sea and wind rose. As it is---&#xD;
knowing all their signals, and having a complete&#xD;
set on bard-it will be an easy thing for me to&#xD;
pass the brig off as a new United States brig-&#xD;
of-war. I know, and am known to, the officers&#xD;
of the frigate, who have had no chance to hear&#xD;
of my resignation ; and I shall visit them in uni-&#xD;
form ; and, giving them false news, perhaps gain&#xD;
news that may be of value to us."&#xD;
"Wall, eapting, you are cute! It was a rale&#xD;
merey on airth that I fell in with you. I haven't&#xD;
got anything more to lay. You're boss over&#xD;
this craft for sartin."&#xD;
Ashton made no reply, but went below and&#xD;
changed his dress for that of his former lieuten-&#xD;
ant's uniform.&#xD;
In the course of an hour more, the-noble frig-&#xD;
ate was close aboard. She had shown her sig-&#xD;
nal number, and Ashton had answered her ; and&#xD;
as she edged down, had thrown his vessel up in&#xD;
the wind with the main-topsail aback, signifying&#xD;
a wish to " speak" the other vessel.&#xD;
Therefore, when the frigate was nearly abreast&#xD;
of the brig, up went her courses, her helm was&#xD;
put alee, and she rounded to, just on the weath-&#xD;
er quarter.&#xD;
" What brig is that ?" asked an officer from&#xD;
the frigate's mizzen-riggings through a trum-&#xD;
pet.-&#xD;
"The United States brig 'Rattlesnake' (new)&#xD;
Lieut. Ashton commanding,^bound on a cruise,"&#xD;
replied the rebel coriander. " Iwill go aboard,&#xD;
if you please. I have late papers with the war&#xD;
news."&#xD;
"We shall be glad to get them," replied the&#xD;
officer.&#xD;
With a carefully-selected file of papers, in&#xD;
which there was no mention of his name, Ash-&#xD;
ton had a boat lowers i, and fearlessly went on&#xD;
board the frigate. 11 is visit was apparently&#xD;
pleasant, for he nit ol friends and shipmates,&#xD;
who as yet did  not km of his treason, and who&#xD;
pledged him in more than one glass, reminding&#xD;
him of gay and hi prv days which were past, to&#xD;
be by him renewed o more. He appeared gay ;&#xD;
but who can tell whit were the real feelings in&#xD;
the depths of his me:t? That a traitor can rest&#xD;
&#xD;
easy and enjoy life, is not probable. Arnold, it&#xD;
is known, led a miserable life ; Judas Iscariot&#xD;
was asuicide; and Aaron Burr, whose very am-&#xD;
bition was treason, descended from the loftiest&#xD;
height, to live out miserably the latter years of&#xD;
a perverted life.&#xD;
Ashton did not remain long on board the frig-&#xD;
ate, from which lie learned that they had passed&#xD;
two heavily-laden, homeward-bound packets&#xD;
early that morning. He returned to his own&#xD;
vessel;' and, as the frigate filled away on her&#xD;
course, he resumed that which he had held be-&#xD;
fore-confident.of falling in, before night, with&#xD;
one or both of the packets of which he had&#xD;
heard.&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
A palace -three stories high, and built of&#xD;
Northern brick at that. Its halls spacious,&#xD;
broad, and lengthy, and crowded with captive&#xD;
sovereigns. But above it floats a strange han-&#xD;
ner. Three bars of white and red, looking like&#xD;
a piece of Dutch patch-work, with seven stars&#xD;
scattered on a patch of blue in one corner. The&#xD;
flag-staff is of palmetto, and a snake is entwined&#xD;
around it-- emblematic of "the snake in the&#xD;
grass" worshiped by the rebellious.&#xD;
A palace now, but once velept a tobacco&#xD;
warehouse, in the great city of'Richmond, which,&#xD;
in 1781, was defended by the chivalrous La-&#xD;

Of course, sir. I am inyour power, and&#xD;

They are well pleased with the idea of a&#xD;

years of age, whose dark, brunette complexion&#xD;
and flashing black eyes told of a Southern ori-&#xD;
gin. By his side stood a beautiful boy, of ap-&#xD;
parently fourteen or fifteen years of age.&#xD;
"I understand you to be a captain in the&#xD;
service of the Confederate States ?" said the&#xD;
gentleman, addressing Ashton.&#xD;
"I am, sir."&#xD;
"Then, sir, I am most happy to meet you.&#xD;
My name is Rutherford. I am from South Car-&#xD;
olina, and am the bearer of important dis-&#xD;
patches to President Davis. Under the assumed&#xD;
name of Osgood, I came on board this packet,&#xD;
with ray son-knowing that packets like this es-&#xD;
cape notice, while every passenger on board the&#xD;
steamers has to go under police surveillance&#xD;
when he reaches a Northern city. I have mon-&#xD;
etary assistance with me for the Southern&#xD;
cause !"&#xD;
I am happy to hear you say so, sir. The&#xD;
hospitalities of my vessel are freely open to&#xD;
you ; and as I shall at once sail, with my prizes,&#xD;
for a point on the Southern coast not blockaded&#xD;
when I last heard from it, I hope soon to be able&#xD;
to place you where you can communicate with&#xD;
President Davis !"&#xD;
"Thank you, Captain. By what name may I&#xD;
address you ?"&#xD;
"Ashton, sir-William Ashton, formerly of&#xD;
the United Statgs Navy !"&#xD;
"Are you fiom the Ashtons on the Wax-'&#xD;
haw ?"&#xD;
"I am, sir. My father's name'is Lee Ash-&#xD;
ton "&#xD;
Why, my dear sir, Inm doubly glad to see&#xD;
you. Your father and myself were college-&#xD;
mates !" cried the gentleman. "Frank, the&#xD;
captain is the son of the gentleman you've heard&#xD;
me speak of so often, as the boldest rider that&#xD;
ever drew rein in a fox-hunt! Captain, this is&#xD;
&#xD;
Frank Rutherford-rather bashful yet, but good&#xD;
stock-good stock ! Come in the cabin, and&#xD;
take a glass of wine from my private stores !"&#xD;
Ashton thought that Master Frank Ruther-&#xD;
ford was indeed bashful; for when he turned&#xD;
his handsome eyes upon him, the boy blushed&#xD;
like a carnation, and his great black eyes sunk&#xD;
under the vail of their long lids.&#xD;
After refre hjng with Mr. Rutherford, Ashton&#xD;
at once set aout transferring his prisoners to&#xD;
his own vessel, and putting prize-crews on board&#xD;
the packets. It was nearly night before this&#xD;
was effected ; and then, with signal-lights hoist-&#xD;
ed, and orders not to part company, the pri-&#xD;
vateer headed off for the south-west, followed&#xD;
closely by her prizes, crowding all the sail they&#xD;
could carry.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
"A salute-what does that mean ?" asked-the&#xD;
prisoners of each other, as gun after gun, in&#xD;
regular succession, boomed on their ears some&#xD;
weeks after the time when we first introduced&#xD;
them in their tobacco-palace at Richmond.&#xD;
"Sonic new victory !" growled a wounded&#xD;
officer. "One of the old grannies has made a&#xD;
Great Bethel mistake, or a Bull Run blunder !"&#xD;
"I'll find out from the officer of the guard !"&#xD;
said Elmer Winchester, who, ever in a good hu-&#xD;
mor, was a favorite even with the rebels, who&#xD;
often, but in vain, made him tempting offers of&#xD;
a high position in their ranks, if he would join&#xD;
them. .&#xD;
He soon returned, with the desired information.&#xD;
"It is not much of a victory !" said he.&#xD;
"One of their privateers-"&#xD;
"Say pirates !" said Mr. Ely, benignly.&#xD;
"Well, one of their pirates has captured and&#xD;
brought in two of our packet-ships, with valu-&#xD;
able cargoes ; and a messenger has arrived with&#xD;
a loan of two or three millions of dollars from&#xD;
some romantic banker abroad ! We are to be&#xD;
treated to the sight of a triumphal procession&#xD;
in a little while. Hark ! there is the musi-.&#xD;
Here goes for a first-class orchestra ticket by the&#xD;
middle window !"&#xD;
And Elmer hastened to get a front position&#xD;
by the window ; for the room was so crowded&#xD;
that not one-tenth of its occupants could look&#xD;
into the street at the same time.&#xD;
Soon the band hove in sight. It consisted of&#xD;
four negro drummers ; four fifers, of the sama&#xD;
color; two buglers, and a clarinet-player, ditto;&#xD;
a lean Dutchman, with a huge bass-horn; a&#xD;
leaner Frenchman, with a trombone, and a very&#xD;
small Dutchman, with an immense ophicleide.&#xD;
Following, was a troop of cavaliers--F. F. V.s&#xD;
-in all styles bf dress and mount. Then came&#xD;
Company B, "Albemarle Yankee-Catchers";&#xD;
Company K, "Floyd's Fly-by-Nights"; Com-&#xD;
pany C, "Pryor's Bowie-Knife Rangers." Then,&#xD;
carriages, with illustrious guests, and civic and&#xD;
military dignitaries.&#xD;

THE RATTLESNAKE; OR, THE REEEL PRIVATEER.&#xD;
&#xD;
As the first of the latter approached, Elmer&#xD;
Winchester uttered a naughty word. In truth,&#xD;
he swore right out before folks.&#xD;
"There is that infernal rascal, Will Ashton,&#xD;
riding in the carriage with Pr sident Davis !"&#xD;
he cried. " He is the pirate titit captured the&#xD;
two packets. Oh! if I only hal him here five&#xD;
minutes, I'd add to his beauty 1'&#xD;
And shouting out the renegade's name, Elmer&#xD;
attracted his attention. Then shaking his&#xD;
clenched fist at him, he cried :&#xD;
"You'll rile to the gallows in a cart yet, you&#xD;
black-muzzled pirate !"&#xD;
Ashton saw and recognized him, smiled bit-&#xD;
terlv, but mae no reply.&#xD;
"Our Bull Run prisoners are rather ob-&#xD;
streperous !" said the President, apologetically ;&#xD;
for he knew not that Ashton was acquainted&#xD;
with any of them. " We are holding them here&#xD;
for a while, to see what the Yankees intend to&#xD;
do with those of our men whem they ha'e taken,&#xD;
They have threatened hanging. If they com-&#xD;
mence, we will follow suit ! Rope will go further&#xD;
than provisions !"&#xD;
And he smiled grimly, as, amid the plaudits&#xD;
of the rabble, the procession moved slowly&#xD;
:along toward the hotel where Will Ashton and&#xD;
his friend Rutherford were to receive the honors&#xD;
of a public dinner.&#xD;
It was late in the day--in fact, I should say&#xD;
it was already evening ; for the prisoners were&#xD;
enioYing their supper of dry bread and sugarless&#xD;
tea--when a messenger came tosummon Elmer&#xD;
Winchester to the guard-room, where a gentle.&#xD;
man-visitor waited to see him.&#xD;
Elmer dropped his crust of bread and tin cup&#xD;
of tea ; for a visitor was an event-one not to be&#xD;
neglected.&#xD;
To his surprise, when he reached the guard-&#xD;
room, William  Ashton, in a glittering  uni-&#xD;
form, stood conversing with the officer of the&#xD;
Guard.&#xD;
"You sent me word that a gentleman wished&#xD;
-to see me !" said he to the officer.&#xD;
" Yes, sir ; and here he is," said the officer,&#xD;
pointing to Ashton.&#xD;
"Do you call that cowardly deserter a gentle-&#xD;
man ?" cried Elmer, scornfully.  " If I had&#xD;
lived in his time, I might have pitied Benedict&#xD;
Arnold; but I should never have despised him&#xD;
as I do this man !"&#xD;
" Poh-poh, Elmer! you needn't make a fool&#xD;
of yourself because I didn't choose to marry&#xD;
your Yankee sister ! I came here out of kind-&#xD;
niess to-"&#xD;
What he came for Ashton had no time to ex-&#xD;
plain ; for before more words than we have re&#xD;
corded had passed his, lips, the clenched hand&#xD;
of Elmer Winchester was dashed furiously into&#xD;
his taee, and he fell, stunned and bleeding, to&#xD;
time floor.&#xD;
"Take that, you cursed pirate ! and thank&#xD;
your stars that I am unarmed, or I'd send voin&#xD;
&#xD;
where you belong-to your master, the devil !"&#xD;
shouted Elmer, almost black with anger.&#xD;
"Mr. Wincheste r, I am astonished at you,&#xD;
sir-you, who have even been a favorite for your&#xD;
good conduct, and treated with such unusual&#xD;
lenity !" cried the officer of the guard, seizing&#xD;
him by the arm.&#xD;
"Sir, if you were a prisoner, far away from&#xD;
an only sister, you would not let a wretch like&#xD;
that speak of her without resenting the insult !"&#xD;
"Perhaps not, sir. But o back to your&#xD;
quarters at once. If Captai Ashton does not&#xD;
report this outrage, I surely will not !"&#xD;
"I shall not report him-but, nyrk me, Elmer&#xD;
Winchester, I will have I'or that blow a ven-&#xD;
geance so deep and dire, that you will hail death&#xD;
as you would a bride when you hear of it. I&#xD;
command as fast a craft as skims the sea-I have&#xD;
a gallant crew, with which I'll make your Yan-&#xD;
kee merchants writhe, as I wrest their cherished&#xD;
millions from them. I only want a mistress in&#xD;
my fairy craft, to sing me lullabies on stormy&#xD;
nights. I shall look for one in Boston ! Good-&#xD;
night, sir-good-night !"&#xD;
And, with a mocking laugh, the rebel captain&#xD;
turned and left the room. Elmer vainly strove&#xD;
to follow him. He was so wildly violent that&#xD;
the officer of the guard had to summon assist-&#xD;
ance, and eventually, much to his regret, was&#xD;
forced to iron him.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
With the knowledge which he had gained&#xD;
while on the United Si ates Coast Survey, assist-&#xD;
ed by Mr. Snaggs, who was, as he had boasted,&#xD;
a capital coast pilot, William Ashton had man-&#xD;
aged, with the assistance of steamers of light&#xD;
draught and lighters, to get his prizes into an&#xD;
inlet of Pamjico Sound, beyond the reach of the&#xD;
United States cruisers, whom lie boldly and suc-&#xD;
cessfully eluded. We have already seen how his&#xD;
services were appreciated by the President of&#xD;
"tie so-called' Confederacy, and also how his&#xD;
real merits were appreciated by poor Elmer&#xD;
Winchester.&#xD;
Ashton was not in a'presentable position when&#xD;
he returned to his hotel after his interview with&#xD;
Elmer. The latter had not taken lessons from&#xD;
Price without avail. He struck from the shoul-&#xD;
der, and threw all his weight into the blow.&#xD;
The consequence was, that Mr. Ashiton's eyes&#xD;
were unnaturally black, and his face swelled into&#xD;
a resemblance of the full moon with a ragged&#xD;
cloud over it. He was obliged to have surgical&#xD;
assistance to remove some of the marks of Yan-&#xD;
- kee hatred ; but there was no lack of sympathy.&#xD;
- He was blamed only because he did not shoot&#xD;
the "infernal Yankee" on the spot.&#xD;
It was a week later. Now regularly commis-&#xD;
sioned as a commander in the Navy of the Con-&#xD;
federate States, William Ashton rejoined his&#xD;
brig, ready for another cruise. To keep his&#xD;

TIlE RATTLESNAKE; OR, THE REBEL PRIVATEER.&#xD;
&#xD;
crew faithful, he had, through the assistance of&#xD;
Mr. Rutherford and the exertions of the Presi-&#xD;
dent, managed to get the privateer's share of the&#xD;
prizes in gold, and his first act was to pay them&#xD;
off in their proper shares. He knew that this&#xD;
would not only firmly bind them to his service,&#xD;
but also give them new zeal in the prosecution&#xD;
of furLher adventures.&#xD;
On the second day after his arrival, he an-&#xD;
nounced tp his crew that on the next morning&#xD;
they must be ready for sea. He would then&#xD;
start upon another cruise. The information was&#xD;
received with cheers.&#xD;
True to his word, as soon as the men had&#xD;
breakfasted on the next day, the order was heard:&#xD;
" All hands, ahoy! Up anchorand make sail l"&#xD;
While the men were hastening to their sta-&#xD;
tions, Ashton observed a shore-boat, rowed by&#xD;
a negro, and containing one passenger, coming&#xD;
alongside.&#xD;
He went to the gangway to see who it was,&#xD;
and was astonished to see Master Frank Ruther-&#xD;
ford, who met him at the rail, followed by the&#xD;
negro, with a large trunk.&#xD;
"Why, what are you doing here, Mr. Ruther-&#xD;
ford ?" asked Ashton, in some astonishment ;&#xD;
for upon the voyage home the youth had avoid-&#xD;
ed all his advances toward friendship, and seem-&#xD;
ed, indeed, as bashful as a girl.&#xD;
"I've fallen in love with ihe sea and your life&#xD;
of adventure, sir; and am come to serve with&#xD;
you in any capacity to which you may appoint&#xD;
me-even as a cabin-boy, if nothing better will&#xD;
do," replied the boy.&#xD;
"Does your father know of your intention ?"&#xD;
asked Ashton, remembering the intense affection&#xD;
which Mr. Rutherford evinced for his child, and&#xD;
the great care he took of him.&#xD;
"He did not when I left him, sir. But I have&#xD;
written to him since. lie would have objected&#xD;
to my coming. To avoid a scene, I came away&#xD;
secretly ; for when I have set my mind upon&#xD;
anything, nothing can change it."&#xD;
"I think you had better reconsider this mat-&#xD;
ter," said Ashton, kindly, looking upon the&#xD;
handsome boy with friendly interest.&#xD;
"It is too late, sir," said young Rutherford,&#xD;
firmly. "Sam, pass that trunk, sword, and gui-&#xD;
tar-case aft. Now, Captain Ashton, the only&#xD;
way you can get rid of me is, to pitch me over-&#xD;
board !"&#xD;
"Which I shall not do at present," said Ash-&#xD;
ton, laughing. "If Acting-midshipman Ruth-&#xD;
erford wishes to take this cruise with me, he can.&#xD;
And if afterward his father consents to his re-&#xD;
maining in the service, I will do all that I can to&#xD;
fit him for advancement in it. So, trot aft,&#xD;
young gentleman, out of the way, while I attend&#xD;
to getting the brig under sail."&#xD;
"Ay, ay, sir !" said the young Southron,&#xD;
touching his cap in jaunty middy style. "May&#xD;
I take Sam with me, sir?  Heis my own prop-&#xD;
erty."&#xD;
&#xD;
27&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes. Snowball needs more help in the&#xD;
cabin."&#xD;
"Then let the old boat go adrift, Sam, and&#xD;
come down in the cabin and stow my things&#xD;
away. But mind, you must be very polite to&#xD;
Snowball, the steward. He's a Cuba darkey,&#xD;
and knows how to use a knife."&#xD;
"Mebbe he's nebber seen dis chile butt !"&#xD;
said Sam, grinning. "Niggers won't say knife&#xD;
to me, when dey knows I can out-butt a billy-&#xD;
goat. He, he, he&#xD;
And Sam, shouldering his master's baggage,&#xD;
followed him into the cabin.&#xD;
In a short time the brig's anchor was aweigh,&#xD;
and soon her spars were bending under the&#xD;
weight of canvas, filled by a spanking breeze&#xD;
from the northwest.&#xD;
"Which way are you going to put the brig's&#xD;
face, capting ?" asked Mr. Suaggs, after the ves-&#xD;
sel had reached the ocean.&#xD;
"After I gain an offing which will carry me&#xD;
clear of the United States cruisers, I shall alter&#xD;
her rig into that of a bark, and go North on a&#xD;
little private business," said Ashton. "That&#xD;
through with, I shall try for the California&#xD;
steamers. One or two of them would enrich&#xD;
the whole of us."&#xD;
"So 'twould," said Sni ggs. "Wasn't it a&#xD;
marey on airth that I happened to run afoul of&#xD;
you? Here we've shared well on to two hun-&#xD;
dred thousand dollar already, and never lost a&#xD;
man. I tell you, this beats the nigger trade all&#xD;
hollow. I begin to feel as if I'd be worth suth-&#xD;
in' handsome afore I die yet. The old folks-ll&#xD;
stare when Ichabod goes home, I'll bet a cookie.&#xD;
You needn't laugh, Mr. Rutherford. I was a&#xD;
runaway jest like you, vhen I went to sea first.&#xD;
And I hain't been hum yet. But I mean to,&#xD;
when I get rich enough."&#xD;
The youngster laughed merrily, as Snaggs&#xD;
addressed him--rather to the astonishment of&#xD;
Ashton, who had noticed the almost utter silence&#xD;
which the lad had kept, especially in the pres-&#xD;
ence of his father on the voyage home.&#xD;
But Snowball announced dinner at this mo-&#xD;
ment, and all but the officer of the deck attend-&#xD;
ed the summons.&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
For a little time after he was ironed and re-&#xD;
manded back to his quarters, poor Elmer Win-&#xD;
chester raved with maniac-like madness. But&#xD;
soothed, in a measure, by his symp athetic fel-&#xD;

"You've got the brig so fixed up, that the&#xD;

said Mr. Snaggs to Ashton, as lie glanced at her&#xD;
course by the compass in the binnacle. "May&#xD;

"D'ye mean to make any port afore long, cap-&#xD;

"Most likely I shall," said Ashton.&#xD;
Seeing the captain was not more communica-&#xD;
tive, Mr. Snaggs hazarded another question.&#xD;
"It isn't York oure gon' to-is it ?" said he&#xD;
" No. I have no business in Newv York."&#xD;
"Nor Providence? nor New Bedford ?"&#xD;
" Ihave no occasion to visit either of those&#xD;
places," said Ashton.&#xD;
"Then, by hokey, it must be BostonI"&#xD;
"Youu are a wizard for guessing, Mr. Snaggs,"&#xD;
said Ashton, with a laugh. " I have a little pri-&#xD;
vate business to attend to in Boston, and am&#xD;
going there. Disguised as wve are, it will be&#xD;
perfectly sfe--especially is I shall run into te&#xD;
lower harbor ony, at night, and then go to town&#xD;
in a boat, and go to sea before the dawn of day&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"Exactly ." said Mr. Snaggs. And then he&#xD;
said to himself:  I do wish I knew what his&#xD;
private business is. I'll find out, for I'll volun-&#xD;
teer to go with him!"&#xD;
"It bill blow heavy to-night, Mr. Snaggs,"&#xD;
said Ashton, looking at a heavy cloud to wind-&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
"Yes, capting. It'll blow great guns, and&#xD;
small-armrs thrown i. It has been brewin' a&#xD;
storm for a week. My rheumatics have been&#xD;
hinting that way most darnedly for two or three&#xD;
days ; and, like the barometer down in the cab-&#xD;
ii, they're mighty apt to tell the truth."&#xD;
You had better begin to shorten sail, and&#xD;
get up preventer stays and braces. And tell the&#xD;
gunner to double is gun-tackle, and see every-&#xD;
thing lashed securely for the gale," said Ashton.&#xD;
I am going below for awhile to rest, for I must&#xD;
be on deck if heavy weather comes on."&#xD;
"Goin' below to hear that young Southern&#xD;
chap play his guitar and sing irs love-songs, I&#xD;
reckon," said Snaggs to himself. " I don't see&#xD;
what's the use mi having such a do-nothin' chiap&#xD;
aboard. But it's no use for ie to say anything.&#xD;
The boy is always a laughing' at me ; and some-&#xD;
times the captain jines in. I s'pose ie can't&#xD;
help it. I don't like it ; but as lie's the goosey&#xD;
that lays eggs of gold for me, I must grin and&#xD;
bear it, as sister Renny used to say when I stub-&#xD;
bed my toe, or sat down a thistle." (   -&#xD;
And with these remarks Mr. Snaggs moved a&#xD;
little nearer to the hatchway to listen to the&#xD;
song, which young Rutherford was giving below,&#xD;
in full and most melodious soprano voice&#xD;
&#xD;

And Mr. Snaggs ordered the boatswain to cali&#xD;

The words which Juthrerford sang, and which&#xD;
elicited the contemptuous remarks from the&#xD;
Yankee,-were these&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
It was three o'clock when the rebel surgeon&#xD;
rode his beautiful cr:rger up in front of the&#xD;
prison-house of Elner Vinclester and his cons&#xD;
rades. Never had the splendid steed looked in&#xD;
better order than when the surgeon dismount-&#xD;
ed, and calling to a small negro boy, told him to&#xD;
hold it till re came out. Elher's eyes flashed&#xD;
as ie saw who was left in charge of the coveted&#xD;
animal. And his face grew pale - not with&#xD;
fear ; but all his blood was gathering to his&#xD;
heart as he nerved himself for Iris daring work.&#xD;
The surgeon came up to make Iris usual in-&#xD;
qiries regarding the health of the prisoners.&#xD;
Elmer slipped down to tre guard-room.&#xD;
Lieutenant Ferguson, the surgeon wishes to&#xD;
see you for a moment, u-stairs," said he to the&#xD;
officer of the guard.&#xD;
The latter instantly started to obey the sum-&#xD;
mons. Now Was Elmer's only chance. Before&#xD;
the lieutenant had reached the upper story,&#xD;
Elmer had seized the uifrn and a heavy&#xD;
sabre.  Dashing by the -tinished sentinel,&#xD;
knocking Iris musket from his hand as he did so,&#xD;
he vaulted into the saddle, and, as tire frighten-&#xD;
ed negro-boy let go the bridle, he gave the&#xD;
horse the steel, and a'ay, at its topmost speed,&#xD;
bounded the splendid animal. IIe had been in&#xD;
his shirt-sleeves. Now -capital horseman as&#xD;
he was-it was not a minute's work, even while&#xD;
at full speed, to buielde the sabre to his side, and&#xD;
to put on the rebel uniform.&#xD;
So sudden had been Iris movement, and so&#xD;

30              THE RATTLESNAKE ; OR,&#xD;
astounded was the guard, that he turned a cor- l&#xD;
ner before a shot could be fi ed at him.&#xD;
Then away he sped toward the Rappahannock&#xD;
road. He knew that he would be quickly pur-&#xD;
sued ; but if he could pass the batteries and&#xD;
guards at the outskirts of the city, all would be&#xD;
safe, On-on he dashed, at furious speed ; but,&#xD;
as no one was yet mounted and in pursuit, lie&#xD;
attracted no extraordinary attention ; for in&#xD;
war-time, orderlies and express-messengers, as&#xD;
well as aids, are expected to "make time" when&#xD;
they travel.&#xD;
As he neared the outer barriers, lie slackened&#xD;
his pace a little, and, as he approached the&#xD;
guard, cried:&#xD;
"I'm off with orders ! There is news at head-&#xD;
quarters, by telegraph.  Look out for work&#xD;
soon, boys !"&#xD;
Recognizing the rebel uniform, the guard did&#xD;
not attempt to stop him; and a clear road was&#xD;
ahead of him.&#xD;
Regulating the speed of his horse to a gait&#xD;
which, though rapid, he hoped lie could carry&#xD;
through until dark, or, at least, until lie could&#xD;
reach the river, Elmer now rode on. The boom&#xD;
of several cannons, as signal-guns, told him&#xD;
that the city had been alarmed, and his escape&#xD;
made known ; yet he felt that, with so macli&#xD;
start and such a noble horse, he could keep the&#xD;
lead of his p ursuers. He examined the hol-&#xD;
sters, and found the pistols and ammunition all&#xD;
right.&#xD;
He had ridden about fifteen miles, and passed,&#xD;
with his uniform, two mounted picket-guards,&#xD;
without question--when looking back from the&#xD;
top of quite a long hill lie had leisurely ascend-&#xD;
ed, to breathe his horse-he saw a cloud of dust&#xD;
a mile or two in his rear, and knew well that he&#xD;
was pursued by a considerable force.&#xD;
Once more lie put his horse to its speed, and,&#xD;
when some ten miles further on, lie came to&#xD;
a very steep hill, hearing no sound of pursuers,&#xD;
lie let his horse walk up it, dismounting himself,&#xD;
the more to rest it. But lie had barely gained&#xD;
its crest, when he heard a shout behind him;&#xD;
and looking back, saw a scattered line of forty&#xD;
or fifty horsemen, urging their animals to the&#xD;
utmost. The foremost was not half a mile in&#xD;
his rear.&#xD;
Again he sprang into the saddle-iot until,&#xD;
however, lie had let his horse take a long&#xD;
draught of water from a spring which gushed&#xD;
out by the road-side. The noble animal, seem-&#xD;
ing to appreciate his kindness, bounded away&#xD;
with renewed vigor; and again he drew away&#xD;
from his pursuers.&#xD;
"If they lo not get fresh horses, I am safe&#xD;
said he. " Night is coming on-it's not more&#xD;
than five or six miles to the river ; and once&#xD;
there, I'll see if my Yankee cunning does not&#xD;
outwit them.!"&#xD;
On -"on - now at his best speed - Elmer&#xD;
dashed ; and while the gloom of twilight was&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RATTLESNAKE ;1OR, THE REBEL PRIVATEER.&#xD;
&#xD;
31&#xD;
&#xD;
TItE R15E     1'lI V AeE   .&#xD;
drawing on apace, he saw before him the glit-&#xD;
tering waters of a broad river.&#xD;
On ahead of him was a small settlement-to&#xD;
his right. a cleared plantation-on his left, a for-&#xD;
est of large pines, sparsely intermingled with&#xD;
trees of smaller growth, mostly hard wood.&#xD;
Hearing his pursuers yet thunderimg in his rear,&#xD;
he looked back and saw that about a dozen, ev-&#xD;
idently on fresh horses, were not more than a&#xD;
quarter of a mile behind him, and were gaining.&#xD;
The matter began to look desperate. He took&#xD;
but an instant for thought. Then he dashed&#xD;
from the road into the forest, still bearing toward&#xD;
the river. In a few moments, he was on its&#xD;
brink. It was now almost dark. In a second,&#xD;
he detached the holsters from the saddle. With&#xD;
his sabre he cut a thorn-bush from a tree, slip-&#xD;
ped it under the tail of his horse, and, with a&#xD;
yell, drove the terrified animal down the steep&#xD;
bank into the river.&#xD;
Then, as the maddened animal swam for the&#xD;
other shore, he quickly hid himself beneath a&#xD;
shelving rock, while his pursuers, who came&#xD;
thundering up, fired volley after volley at what&#xD;
they supposed to be the steed and rider in the&#xD;
half-gloom-hidden stream beyond.&#xD;
"We've done for the Yankee, I'll swear !"&#xD;
cried the leader, as the horse was seen to go up&#xD;
the opposite bank apparently riderless. "It'll&#xD;
learn some more of 'em not to try to get out of&#xD;
our clutches-I reckon ! Let's go down to old&#xD;
Southark's and get some peach and honey. Such&#xD;
riding as this makes ife as dry as a preacher."&#xD;
Elmer was so near the speaker that he could&#xD;
have touched him with his sabre ; and he felt&#xD;
relieved when the party acceded to the propos-&#xD;
al to visit Mr. Southark's and liquor.&#xD;
Having heard his horse neigh, repeatedly, on&#xD;
the opposite shore of the river, he now looked&#xD;
for some means of crossing, feeling confident&#xD;
that lie would be pursued no further, in conse-&#xD;
quence of is supposed (lentil ; and that, if be&#xD;
could mount again, lie could reach the Poto-&#xD;
mac, not many miles distant, without trouble.&#xD;
With this idea, lie commenced looking for a&#xD;
boat ; and soon, to his joy, found a small skiff,&#xD;
which lie unmoored, and having paddled some&#xD;
way up the river in the demise shadow of the&#xD;
woods, he turned across. In less thiin an hour,&#xD;
le found his horse, which had swam away from&#xD;
the tormenting thorn-bush in the river, proba-&#xD;
bly. The animal was quietly feeding in some&#xD;
rank grass, and seemed quite rested when he&#xD;
again mounted.&#xD;
lie rode on for some time through a forest&#xD;
which skirted that side of t.e river, and at last,&#xD;
struck a road which led in the direction of the&#xD;
Potomac. And lie had the pleasure to see the&#xD;
first rays of the morning sun glitter upon the&#xD;
last-named river. Observing the solitary house&#xD;
of a planter near its 2ank. with a lot of negro-&#xD;
cabins near, he rode boldly up to the former,&#xD;
and asked for its proprietor.&#xD;
&#xD;

"Maybe not, father !" said his son. ' The&#xD;
last words the young man said to me was: 'Tell&#xD;
your father that if anything happens to prevent&#xD;
my returning by his house, that I will send his&#xD;
horse back!"&#xD;

CHAPTJIR XIX,&#xD;
Never was a returned officer received with&#xD;
more kindness than Elmer Winchester, when he&#xD;
reported first to the colonel of his regiment, as&#xD;
in duty bound, and then went with him to the&#xD;
Army Head-quarters, to report to the command-&#xD;
ing general.&#xD;
After he had modestly related the particulars&#xD;
of his daring escape, without giving his private&#xD;
reasons for the attempt, he gave the veteran"&#xD;
general the list of Maryland rebels which Cul-&#xD;
bertson had given to him, and also related im-&#xD;
portant points of information given by them to&#xD;
him voluntarily-they having full faith in his&#xD;
being i rebel officer.&#xD;
"Those men must ie arrested !" said the&#xD;
general. "We are in more danger from such&#xD;
secret traitors than in all the advances of an&#xD;
open enemy. A Cabinet meeting will be held&#xD;
this evening; and I shall send for you, in order&#xD;
that the President and his Constitutional advis-&#xD;
ers may hear your statement, and join with you&#xD;
in congratulating you upon your bold escape,&#xD;
and in complimenting you upon your bravery.&#xD;
If you will accept a commission in the regular&#xD;
army, I feel warranted in saying that it shall be&#xD;
tendered to you."&#xD;
i  "I am very grateful, general," replied Elmer.&#xD;
" I have, however, a favor to ask, which, with-&#xD;
out a knowledge of the very pressing circum-&#xD;
stances which cause the request, and which are&#xD;
strictly private, may seem inopportune when&#xD;
the enemy is in the field!"&#xD;
"Any favor that is consistent with the de-&#xD;
mands of the public service will not be refused,"&#xD;
said the general. " Your sufferings, as well as&#xD;
your gallantry, commend you to especial fa-&#xD;
vor !"&#xD;
"The favor I ask is, a brief furlough, sir.&#xD;
Considerations of immense personal importance&#xD;
to myself and my family, demand my immedi-&#xD;
ate attendance at home. But rest assured, sir,&#xD;
that I shall not remain a moment longer away&#xD;
from the army than the private affairs to which&#xD;
I refer imperatively require. I hope that only&#xD;
a week's absence will be all that I require !"-t&#xD;
",To-morrow you shall receive a month's fur.&#xD;
lough!" said the general, kindly. "If you&#xD;
choose to shorten it by an earlier return, we&#xD;
will be glad to see you. Your colonel and&#xD;
ourself will gratify me by taking a plain fami-&#xD;
ly dinner with me to-day."&#xD;
&#xD;
The officers cheerfully assented, ani as the&#xD;
general said that he dined at three, they consid-&#xD;
ered the interview ended, and withdrew.&#xD;
"We will walk around to ' Willards' to meet&#xD;
celebrities and read the papers, lieutenant," said&#xD;
the colonel. "You will be one of the celebri-&#xD;
ties, as soon as the 'particulars of your escape&#xD;
are made known through the press."&#xD;
"Without General Scott, or those who have&#xD;
an officialright to possess those particulars,&#xD;
make them known, I rather think the press will&#xD;
not possess them," said Elmer, quietly. "I have&#xD;
no desire to see myself in print, and like a&#xD;
newspaper reporter about as well as I do a dose&#xD;
of tartar-emetic. I had a surfeit of the class at&#xD;
Richmond."&#xD;
A red-faced, rather jauntily-dressed young&#xD;
man, with a peaked nose, and-sharp, ferret-like&#xD;
eyes, at this moment stepped out from Ham-&#xD;
mack's far-famed saloon. No sooner had his&#xD;
quick eyes rested on Colonel ---- and Elmer,&#xD;
than he rushed up to the former with extended&#xD;
hand, and said :&#xD;
"Colonel     , how are you, sir?  Delighted&#xD;
to see you, sir ! Fine weather this side of the&#xD;
Potomac ! How is it on the other side, sir ?'&#xD;
"Really, sir, you have the advantage of me&#xD;
in acquaintance," said the colonel, drawing up&#xD;
his portly figure.&#xD;
"Is it possible that you have forgotten me.&#xD;
sir '?" said the young man, with an air of mel-&#xD;
ancholy surprise. "I had theionor to be in-&#xD;
troduced to you at the foot of the stair-case in&#xD;
the Marshal house, at Alexandria, where poor&#xD;
Ellsworth fell, and there lent you my jack-knife&#xD;
to cut off a relic with. I was introduced to you&#xD;
by Colonel Parrott. My nane is Senacherib.&#xD;
I am a special correspondent of the Quadrilat-&#xD;
eral, of New York."&#xD;
" Ah, yes--a reporter. I remember," said the&#xD;
colonel, apologetically,&#xD;
Then thinking it might be as well to stand&#xD;
fair with even a reporter, the colonel bethought&#xD;
him of their peculiarities as a class, and polite-&#xD;
ly asked Mr. Senacherib to turn around, re-enter&#xD;
Hammack's, and imbibe.&#xD;
To which proposition the special made no ob-&#xD;
jection.&#xD;
The colonel then introduced Lieutenant Elmer&#xD;
Winchester to the special.&#xD;
"Is it possible? Do I really behold the hero&#xD;
of the late brilliant escape from.Richmond ?"&#xD;
cried the overjoyed special, looking at the shad-&#xD;
ow of a ten-dollar " special" article descriptive&#xD;
of "the hero and his deeds.' "Sir, I am de-&#xD;
lighted to see you, and shall be most happy to&#xD;
hear from your lips the particulars."&#xD;
"If I am in the city day after to-morrow, you&#xD;
shall have them, sir," said Elmer, coldly, as he&#xD;
thought of his forthcoming furlough.   "At&#xD;
present, until the Government consents, my lips&#xD;
are sealed."&#xD;
" Ah, yes ! I see-I see. The Government&#xD;

peared on the threshold as she advanced. A&#xD;
sudden gust of wind blew out the lamp, which&#xD;
she carried, and at the same instant, as she saw&#xD;
that a carriage was at the door, a pair of strong&#xD;
armsaencircled her, and a well-known but now&#xD;
hated voice, hissed in her ear :&#xD;
" Fluta Winchester, you are mine !"&#xD;
She gave one piercing shriek-no more ; for&#xD;
her shawl was instantly thrust in her mouth, and&#xD;
in another moment she was in the carriage,&#xD;
which drove off at a fearfully-rapid pace.&#xD;
The servant who had followed her, heard the&#xD;
words he had spoken, and even recognized the&#xD;
voice of Willia Ashton. Rie sprung forward&#xD;
to rescue his lady; lhut he was struck down by&#xD;

Ashbtn  through his trumpet. " Mr. Snaggs,&#xD;

she gets sternway. Round with the calistan,&#xD;
my hearty ina.    See the fore-storm-sta'sail&#xD;
ready for hoisting when she veers to the wind."&#xD;
The crew worked with a-will ; for they knew it&#xD;
would be grog-time when the anchor was on the&#xD;
bows, and the thought exhilarated them. Soon&#xD;
the cry :'" She's short, sir !" was uttered by the&#xD;
b atswain. Then, in a moment: " She's broke&#xD;
ground, sir !" caine shrilly aft on the breath of&#xD;
the gale.&#xD;
Snaggs shifted the helm, for the vessel was&#xD;
making stern-hoard. Her bow veered away to&#xD;
port ; and, a moment after, Ashtou shouted :&#xD;
" Hoist away the fore-storm, staysail and haul&#xD;
the sheet to wimdward."-&#xD;
By the time that sail was set, the boatswain&#xD;
piped to the men i)to pall time capstan, and shout-&#xD;
ed : "Anchor's up, sir!&#xD;
Very well   Man the topsail halhiards and&#xD;
sheets ; haul out time spanker. Sheet home and&#xD;
hoist the topsails. Slack the weather-braces-&#xD;
in with the lee ones."&#xD;
Rapidly the well drilled crew obeyed each or-&#xD;
der ; and soon the vessel, gathering headway,&#xD;
shot out from the smooth water of the little&#xD;
cove into tme heavy sea i of the bay beyond.&#xD;
The close-reefed topsails, spanker, and -storm-&#xD;
staysail only were upon her, yet she heeled over&#xD;
until her le-rail almost touched the water, and&#xD;
she threw the white foam high above her bows.&#xD;
The red sun was struggling its way up amidst&#xD;
a mass of black, swift-drivming, ragged clouds,&#xD;
and upon every side the white-caps crested the&#xD;
surgimg waves.&#xD;
The first tack of the vessel threw her bows&#xD;
rather up the harbor, and made her course tend&#xD;
toward one of mime island-forts which was erected&#xD;
to defend time entrance of the port.&#xD;
And from  this fort, when Ashton threw his&#xD;
vessel into stays to go on the other tack, he&#xD;
learned that his character was suspected, if not&#xD;
known. For one of its heavy ten-inch guns sent'&#xD;
a shot after him, which did not fall more than a&#xD;
able's length short of him. Another came still&#xD;
nmearr ; bmt by that time time vessel had got head-&#xD;

THE REBEL PRIVATEER.                       45&#xD;
But Ashton now saw, on looking up the har-&#xD;
bor with his glass, that two revenue-cutters were&#xD;
under way, beating down the harbor with all the&#xD;
canvas that they could carry. And a dense,&#xD;
black smoke, rising from the Charleston Navy&#xD;
Yard, told him that a steamer was firing up.&#xD;
4 The hounds have got our scent," he mutter-&#xD;
ed, scornfully.  " I'll show them  my colors, at&#xD;
any rate, for they evidently know Imc."&#xD;
And with his own hands, he hoisted the rebel&#xD;
rag at the gaff. After he had done this, he or-&#xD;
dered the crew to loose and sheet home the&#xD;
mainsail, for one of the cutters was evidently&#xD;
gaining upon him.&#xD;
" I know the craft," he muttered. "It is&#xD;
young Bennett's yacht-a volunteer cruiser. If&#xD;
she comes under ani guns, she may lose some&#xD;
of her fmncy-work."&#xD;
The " Rattlesnake" now    had   moore, thian&#xD;
enough wimd. Her hull creaked and groaned ;&#xD;
her spars buckled like reeds in the gale. But&#xD;
staunch and well rigged, she staggered on-&#xD;
sometimes dipping her lee-rail, and often taking&#xD;
in water over her brows.&#xD;
The crew mow received their grog and break-&#xD;
fast; and after that Ashton mmde them get all&#xD;
the guns below    except the two pivot-guns,&#xD;
'which could be used to lire on his pmisuelt.&#xD;
For he saw that to escape he must trim his ves-&#xD;

attack from  the cutters, though, better armed&#xD;
and manned, lie could have silenced tiems-for&#xD;

would disable him  amid enable the steamer to&#xD;
come up with him.&#xD;
ie stood on his second tack as long as he&#xD;
could, until he was close in shore-for it was his&#xD;

on her right; and the next moment she wasI&#xD;
threading her way through a narrow channel in-&#xD;
side of a tremendous range of breakers which&#xD;
hid everything else from the view of those on&#xD;
deck.    ,&#xD;
From his perch, Ashton could see a range of&#xD;
breakers extending seaward as far as the eye&#xD;
could reach. Put where his vessel was, the water&#xD;
was, smoeth-though the channel was devious&#xD;
and narrow, requiring a constant watch and&#xD;
most rapid handling of both helm and braces.&#xD;
)     But with smooth water and such a wind, she&#xD;
made rapid headway, and her escape no longer&#xD;
seemed an impossibility; for, long before the&#xD;
frigate could weather the reef to windward, she&#xD;
would be stretching away toward the islands off&#xD;
the New Hampshire coast, and probably be out&#xD;
of reach. For it was scarcely expectable that&#xD;
either of the cutters or the steamer would at-&#xD;
tempt the perilous path which she had taken.&#xD;
For full an hour-perhaps nearer two of them&#xD;
-the "Rattlesnake" dashed on, at times barely&#xD;
clearing the jagged rocks on either hand, and&#xD;
then she emerged into a clear sea. The reef&#xD;
was still outside, but wide and clear water was&#xD;
ahead, and Ashton came down from aloft.&#xD;
The men, during all of the time of peril, had&#xD;
remained silent - obeying the orders which&#xD;
came from aloft with celerity, but hardly look-&#xD;
ing at each other. the danger was so great. But&#xD;
now, when the action of their skillful command-&#xD;
er told them that the clanger was past, they burst&#xD;
forth into three as hearty cheers as ever came&#xD;
from the lips of men.&#xD;
He acknowledged their feelings by a cheering&#xD;
word or two, and sent a look-out aloft to keep&#xD;
watch ; and, at the same time, had the fore and&#xD;
mainsails set, and the mizzen gaff-topsail. For&#xD;
he still felt the necessity of keeping the lead&#xD;
which he had gained ; for he knew that his pur-&#xD;
suers would not be likely to give up the chase&#xD;
in a hurry.&#xD;
"If hollering would do any good, I'd holler&#xD;
myself hoarse to show how tarnation glad I am&#xD;
to be out o' that scrape !" said Mr. Snaggs, now&#xD;
resigning his station at the helm to the other&#xD;
steersman. "If ever there was a marcy on&#xD;
airth, 'twas when I met you, capting! I should&#xD;
have gin up afore I'd- have dared to run the&#xD;
craft where you did. There's not a pilot out o'&#xD;
Boston would try it ! See ! them revenue cut-&#xD;
ters has gone about on t'other tack, and the&#xD;
steamer is heading right out for sea. They&#xD;
think they can eut us off; but while they're&#xD;
working out in the teeth of the hurricane, we're&#xD;
running off full twelve or fourteen knots. on a&#xD;
slack bow-line. We'll have 'em out of sight in&#xD;
two or three hours !"&#xD;
" Yes ; if the wind holds as it is. We've been&#xD;
lucky," said Ashton.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
When Frank Rutherford went below,in obedi-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE REBEL PRIVATEER.                     47&#xD;
L ence to the orders of Ashton, he found Doctor&#xD;
Umbilicus watching over the sleeping form of&#xD;
poor Fluta.&#xD;
"Well, friend Sawbones, how does the demoi-&#xD;
selle prosper ?" he cried.&#xD;
"When you address me in my proper name,&#xD;
Master Jackanapes, I may answer you!' said&#xD;
the doctor, spitefully.&#xD;
"You'd better take a turn with your jaw-&#xD;
tackle," said the laughing youngster. "How&#xD;
would you like me to tell the captain that I&#xD;
caught you kissing this pet of his?"&#xD;
"I should tell him that it was a base fabrica-&#xD;
tion of yours."&#xD;
"Pooh !--he'd believe my word against your&#xD;
oath! But I won't tell of you, if you don't of&#xD;
mc. Here goes for a kiss, any way !"&#xD;
And-the audacious youngster actually bent his&#xD;
face down and kissed the sleeping girl.&#xD;
" Quae indecora!" said the doctor, raising his&#xD;
hands in horror.&#xD;
"Dont faint, doctor! The captain sent me&#xD;
down here to help you take care of her, and I'm,&#xD;
sure I'm doing it! She's asleep, and a kiss won't&#xD;
hurt her. Now let's be friends. I'm going to&#xD;
mix a sherry sangaree for myself. Shall I mix&#xD;
a rum punch for you ?"&#xD;
According to the "Pickwiek Papers," the Rev-&#xD;
erend Mr. Stiggins had a "vanity."   It was&#xD;
pine-apple runm, hot, with three lumps of sugar&#xD;
in it-if my memory serves me ; for it is well on&#xD;
to twenty years since I read the aforesaid "Pa-&#xD;
pers."&#xD;
And Doctor Umbilicus had a weakness. It was&#xD;
Jamacia rum, cold, without much water, but with&#xD;
plenty of sugar and lemon in it Therefore, in&#xD;
reply to the youngster, he said, with an air of&#xD;
forgiveness:&#xD;
"You may mix me a punch, Mr. Rutherford,&#xD;
if it is not too much trouble."&#xD;
Frank mixed the punch; and as the doctor&#xD;
smacked his lips over it, he inwardly forgave&#xD;
the youth for his many annoyances.&#xD;
" How long will she sleep, doctor ?" asked&#xD;
Frank.&#xD;
"Two or three hours, she will remain in a&#xD;
somnolent state," said the doctor. "I gave her&#xD;
an opiate to soothe her nerves."&#xD;
"I believe I could sleep just now without an&#xD;
opiate," said the youngster. "The vessel pitches&#xD;
and rocks like a bird's-nest on a swinging limb.&#xD;
I'll tumble down on the sofa here. doctor; and if&#xD;
you need me, why call me-that's all."&#xD;
And Frank threw himself on the sofa, and&#xD;
soon was, apparently, sound asleep.&#xD;
And as drowsiness is contagious, the doctor&#xD;
leaned back with his head against the berth&#xD;
where poor Fluta lay, and, opening his mouth,&#xD;
closed his eyes. It was a peculiarity of his to&#xD;
do this. Ile never could shut his eves without&#xD;
opening hip mouth. And such a mouth! It ex-&#xD;
tended from ear to ear, almost. Its teeth were&#xD;
snaggy-in fact, the interior of his month looked&#xD;

58              THE RATTLESNAKE; OR,&#xD;
whose red, juicy pulp she sliced up as a tempt- !&#xD;
ing morsel for her guests.&#xD;
"How do you like this, for a change ?" asked&#xD;
Frank of Fluta, whie Abeona was absent a mo-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"it is like heaven to be away from him-to be&#xD;
where I cannot hear /is hated voice !" said&#xD;
Fluta. " Cannot you hide me here so that he&#xD;
can never find rme, arid musot sail without me ?''&#xD;
"I have been thinking of it," said Frank ;&#xD;
" or, rather, of something bolder still ; for he&#xD;
would search every spot here so closely, that&#xD;
it would be in vain to try and hide you here !"&#xD;
What did you think of   Tehi nse, and if&#xD;
there is a hope of escape, I care n t how des-&#xD;
perate the plan, I am  ready to undertake it,"&#xD;
said Fluta.&#xD;
"The main land and the harbor of Ports-&#xD;
mouth, New Hamnpshire, is not more than twen-&#xD;
ty-five or thirty miles west of us, and if I could&#xD;
persuade Abeona's father to convey you there&#xD;
in his shallop, you would be safe,"~said Frank.&#xD;
"For, by railroad, you would be within a few&#xD;
hours' ride of home."&#xD;
"Oh yes ! And I have friends in Portsmouth,&#xD;
too. Oh, do try and get the man to take me&#xD;
there !"&#xD;
"Does your father go to the main land, ever ?"&#xD;
asked Frank of Abeona, whent she came ii, a few&#xD;
moments after.&#xD;
Not often," replied the girl. " Only two or&#xD;
three times since 1 can reieiber, whenl ie had&#xD;
to go to get some things-lie needed. Since then,&#xD;
two ships were wrecked near by us ; aiid, l got&#xD;
such a great quantity of things that lie says hie&#xD;
will never have to go where mite are again.&#xD;
And the old shallop is not -safe. It leaks, and&#xD;
the sail is rotten."&#xD;
Leaky or not, we iust try it," said Fluta.&#xD;
" I will never go back to that vessel alive !"&#xD;
What does she mean :" asked Abeona.&#xD;
Frank replied, hv telling Abeona how Fluta&#xD;
had been abductedfrom her home by Ashton-&#xD;
her desire to get back, and then ieged the&#xD;
sweet girl t-  persuade her father to take Fluta&#xD;
to the main land.&#xD;
" I will try," said Abeona. " I wil call him&#xD;
here, and then you must tell hin all the story.&#xD;
He has a good heart, if he is rough, and will do&#xD;
all he can for my srke."&#xD;
The recluse was called in, and listened atten-&#xD;
tively to all that Frank related to him.&#xD;
" Did I not say that men were devils ?" lie&#xD;
said, when she paused, "Here is proof ?' And&#xD;
he looked first at Abeona, and then at Fluta.&#xD;
"Will you carry her to the shore. so that&#xD;
this poor lady can escape from her 1eril ?" asked&#xD;
Frank. "1 will go myself to help you."&#xD;
"Yes; and leave Abeona to be carried off by&#xD;
that devil !" said the man. "No-o !"&#xD;
" Let Abeona go with us-when ie is gone,&#xD;
you can conic back here "&#xD;
"No ; the shallop leaks-is rotten, and will&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE REBEL PRIVATEER.&#xD;
not carry us all. If a little gale should rise, she&#xD;
would go to pieces."&#xD;
"0   heavens!-is there no hope for me ?"&#xD;
sighed Fluta, tearfully.&#xD;
"Sell me your shalop! I will bear all dam-&#xD;
ages !" said Frank, resolutely.&#xD;
"Jf he goes, I Will go !" said Abeona, to her&#xD;
father.&#xD;
He only laughed-a-wild, strange laugh.&#xD;
I am in earnest, father," site said.&#xD;
" None of you shall go !" he said, and laughed&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"I will kill myself before I am aanin placed&#xD;
in that bad man's power !" said Fluta.&#xD;
"I will keep you from his power," said the&#xD;
man. "lie will cone Ihere to look for you, and&#xD;
will not find you. Whn i e is one. then we&#xD;
will find ourselves. They, too, will sing, and&#xD;
you and me will dance."&#xD;
"Trust my father--he las soie plan formed&#xD;
for saving you," said Abona.&#xD;
"Send our boat back to the vessel, and tell&#xD;
the crew they need not coe or you until sun-&#xD;
set,".said the i cluse to Frank. "" When they&#xD;
arc gone, I will show you all a big secret, which&#xD;
no one knows but myself."&#xD;
Frank hastened to obey his directions.&#xD;
Wlhen the boat had left the lauding-place, ie&#xD;
hurried back to the hut.&#xD;
"We must chance our quarters, now," said&#xD;
the recluse. " Write a let ter to sour ca ptain,"&#xD;
added he to Frank, "and iii it tel hint that you&#xD;
have gone to Portsnmouth, und that he ade ht-&#xD;
ter leave these waters soon, or the cruisers may&#xD;
be after him."&#xD;
Frank did this, anmd then the recluse said to&#xD;
Abeona, as he took her harp : "Bring your&#xD;
guitar, and come with me. Come all," he&#xD;
added. "We have a short voyage to maie,&#xD;
and no time to lose !'&#xD;
They obeyed, wondering what he meant to&#xD;
do.&#xD;
He hurriedly led the way down to the landing,&#xD;
where he launched the frail, old slatllop, putting&#xD;
in its sail.&#xD;
" Get in, al of you 'lie said. " Get in !"&#xD;
"Are you lealy going to risk a oytune to the&#xD;
main ?" said Frank, as ie noticed the condittmn&#xD;
of the boat.&#xD;
"No questions-do as you are told'!" was the&#xD;
curt reply.&#xD;
They all got in, and ithe isan took the oars&#xD;
and boldly rowed out of the entrance toward&#xD;
the open sea. As the water bub bled in through&#xD;
the open seams of the leaking boat, Frank ex-&#xD;
claimed:&#xD;
, " Thsis smadness!-the boat wil lneve keep&#xD;
above water long enough to reach the main&#xD;
land !"&#xD;
"No ; I think not," said the man. Anid again&#xD;
a strange smile passed over his face.&#xD;
Fear not," said Abeona. " All is right&#xD;
when father smiles." *&#xD;

For time will teach me to forget thee.'&#xD;
"Yours in a hurry,       FLANK RUTHERroRD."&#xD;
"This may be but a ruse! But I will see.&#xD;
When daylight comes I will search every foot&#xD;
of the island '' said Ashton, as lie angrily tore&#xD;
up the note and scattered the fragments on the&#xD;
floor.&#xD;
He then returned to his vessel in anything&#xD;
but a contented humor.&#xD;
"Ias that youngster run away, capting ?"&#xD;
asked Snaggs,'when Ashton canse on board.&#xD;
" What is it to you whether he has or not?"&#xD;
said Ashton, s0nail  iv.'&#xD;
"Nothin'' muc "l in' plied  Snaggs, testily.&#xD;
" Only if he has, it's but a small loss!  That is&#xD;
my opinion!"-&#xD;
Aid Mr. i-bnaggs, having deliveredhis opinion,&#xD;
went to wi' iin his former occupation, that of&#xD;
mixing himself a glass of "hot Jammalcy."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
The occupants of the cave saw the sun-set&#xD;
boat push off from    the brig, according   to&#xD;
Frank's directions for it to come for him. And&#xD;
they also saw its return, and the angry gestures&#xD;
of Asiton, as he sprang int 1 it to visit the is-&#xD;
land in person.&#xD;
"I can imagine just what he is saying now,"&#xD;
said Frank, with a laugh.  " And how he will&#xD;
swear whenhlie reads my letter. It was anything&#xD;
but complimentary and conciliatory."&#xD;
"The ladies and gentleman will please to come&#xD;
to supper," said the father of Abeona, at this&#xD;
juncture.&#xD;
And he led the way to a little natural alcove&#xD;
which he had carpeted with solie costly goods&#xD;
'-bales of which hie hind arranged for seats.&#xD;
Here, upon a table which had evidently served&#xD;
in the cabin of a hianmdsomely-fitted vessel, he&#xD;
had tea served, also crackers, preserved fruits,&#xD;
meats, sardines, pickles, and various other lux-&#xD;
ulies.&#xD;
"No danger of starvation where I dwell," lie&#xD;
said, as he marshaledl his guests to s ats.  "Two&#xD;
winter storms provided more for 1me than we&#xD;
could use in years. And much of it will keep.&#xD;
I doubt much if there arc many who own a&#xD;
better vine-cellar !"&#xD;

"I surely will not negTect his kindness, nor&#xD;
will I ever forget it !" said Flute. "Do you&#xD;
think that the vessel will remain long"'&#xD;
"No, I am sure it will not. When Ashton&#xD;
finds that we really are gone, hie will fear for&#xD;
his own safety too much to remain an hour&#xD;
longer than lie can help in his present location&#xD;
lie knows that he works now with his neck in a&#xD;
halter!"&#xD;
"Might he not be bold enough to run into&#xD;
Portsmouth to see if he can get a trace of us '"&#xD;
"No, lie is fool-hardy, but not quite enough&#xD;
to visit a United States naval station after ll&#xD;
that has happened lately! Shall I help you to&#xD;
some of these pickled oysters ?"&#xD;
" Thanks!   Lou have helped me too lenti-&#xD;
fully already !"&#xD;
Will it be liafe for us to have music alter&#xD;
supper ?" asked Frank of Abeona's father.&#xD;
Yes ! The vessel is a mile away, and the&#xD;
roll of breakers between us will drown all souns.&#xD;
I brought the harp and guitar, so that we may&#xD;
have music.  When I listen to music the do i&#xD;
goes out of me and angels come and sit by me,&#xD;
and whisper me to forget the past! We wil&#xD;
have music ; and when we are weary, 'we w  t&#xD;
sleep and have pleasant dreams. I have pre-&#xD;
pared soft couches for all.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
Early on the next morning Ashton landed&#xD;
with his boat's crew, tnd tboroughva starched&#xD;
every portion of the island in vain, for he could&#xD;
find no trace of the absentees. Feeling convil ced&#xD;
that they had indeed made their way to the min-&#xD;
land, he returned on board in eve amm worse re-&#xD;
Sper than he had exhibited on the eveIilg he-&#xD;
fore. To lose Fluta Winchester' after ie had&#xD;
run so much risk to capture her, was very gal-&#xD;
ling to him. And to be thlwarted in his devilish&#xD;
enterprise by a boy like Frank Ruthierford,&#xD;
made the matter worse and worse.&#xD;
lIe exhibited his Ill-himnir to ill hands, not&#xD;
excluding Snaggs, Snowball. or even poor Doc-&#xD;
tor Umbilicus. But those who knew the cause&#xD;
of it, did not mind it; for, with ithe super-titin m&#xD;
of all old tars, they aid their late ill-lortune to&#xD;
the fact of their having had a woman on board,&#xD;
and they were secretly glad that she was gone.&#xD;
Neither Snaggs nor the doctor hiked young&#xD;
Rutherford. Ile had played toll many practically&#xD;
jokes upon them, and was forever turning both&#xD;
their words and actions into ri lie.&#xD;
Sam only was disconsolate, lie blulbere-d and&#xD;
wept to think his Mrs'r Frank should go ott and&#xD;

These were not long in getting on board, and&#xD;
soon, with her jib, mam, and foresails drawing&#xD;

Frank had not forgotten to purchase a coast-&#xD;

The words of the song were not so funny, but&#xD;
Pat's droll way of singing them brought tears to&#xD;
the girls' eyes-tears of laughter, however.&#xD;
But we are off our course in the story line.&#xD;
Young Winchester ran far enough out to sea&#xD;
to strike the edge of the Gulf Stream, and then&#xD;
bore away to the southward. His intention was&#xD;
to run down to an inlet, which Frances Ruther-&#xD;
ford showed him on the chart, and near which&#xD;
her fathers house was situated, and to take the&#xD;
responsibility of running in there under a flag&#xD;
of truce, and landing her and the Dinsmores ;&#xD;
and then to pursue his cruise, hoping again to&#xD;
meet them when the blessed angel of peace&#xD;
Caine to still the temn pest of war.&#xD;
For he did not think that the madness of re-&#xD;
bellion, fanned into life by the incendiary breath&#xD;
of a few disappointed demons of ambition, would&#xD;
long usurp the power of reason in minds once&#xD;
patriotic , and hoped, even as our bravest war-&#xD;
riors and truest patriots hope, soon to see&#xD;
"one country and oiie flag-one people, and&#xD;
they a brotherhood" again.&#xD;
CIIAPTER XLIX.&#xD;
After Aishtoin lost the packet-ship off the har-&#xD;
bor of Boston, well knowing that the alarm&#xD;
would fly along the coast on the wings of light--&#xD;
ning, he concluded to shift his cruising-ground&#xD;
without delay.   For he too well knew      the&#xD;
character of the navy which lie had just left, to&#xD;
desire to fall in with any of its cruisers, especial-&#xD;
ly any of equal or superior force.&#xD;
So, standing across the Gulf Stream, he head-&#xD;
ed away for the most windward of the West In-&#xD;
dia Islands.&#xD;
Weathering these, and capturing three sugar&#xD;
&#xD;
and coff e 1 ln ve sels, which he s nt with&#xD;
pr ze-re   o a i  cteure inlet on the Florida&#xD;
east, amiiien i" lii nit expect would be block-&#xD;
aded, and whence their cargo, could be easily&#xD;
landed, he squared away ior the, track of the&#xD;
homeward-uound steamers from    California,&#xD;
which, as lie knew, generally carried a. large&#xD;
quantity of specie on freight, besides the im-&#xD;
mense amount held by passengers returning&#xD;
from the Tierra del Ora.&#xD;
Having a schedule of their days of sailing, he&#xD;
knew almost to an hour and a league when and&#xD;
where he could meet one ; and so arranged his&#xD;
time and shaped his course as to lie in the&#xD;
track of one on the day after she should leave&#xD;
Aspinwall for New York.&#xD;
Knowing that they all carried a couple of&#xD;
guns, were full-handed, and had generally a&#xD;
large number of passengers, he did not expect&#xD;
to make a capture without resistance. And he&#xD;
kept his men thoroughly exercised at great and&#xD;
small arms, telling them openly of his plan, and&#xD;
saying that, though they might expect a rich&#xD;
prize, they would surely have to fight for it.&#xD;
And money is worth fighting for, boys," said&#xD;
Mr. Snaggs. " This fightin' for honor is all&#xD;
fudge. Honor won't buy a man's grog, nor&#xD;
clothes for his back, nor victuals for his belly.&#xD;
But money will' buy anything - everything !&#xD;
Money is what we go in for ; and we're bouni to&#xD;
have it this time, or go under l Three cheers&#xD;
for the casting, and then all hands to liquor.&#xD;
Them's msy sentiments !"&#xD;
Of course, the crew responded to the senti-&#xD;
ments of Mr. Snaggs, backed as they were by&#xD;
call to which few old tars will turn a deaf car--&#xD;
the call to liquor.&#xD;
It was a fair day, with a good ten-knot breeze&#xD;
blowing, when the look-out in the crss-trees of&#xD;
the "Rattlesnake" first sighted the smoke of the&#xD;
expected steamer. And his announcement of&#xD;
the fact was received with three cheers by the&#xD;
crew below, who with alacrity obeyed Ashton's&#xD;
orders to put the vessel in trim for action.&#xD;
In a short time, the look-out sung out from&#xD;
aloft that lie saw the smoke of another steamer,&#xD;
which seemed to be in company with the first.&#xD;
Ashton looked uneasy when he heard this.&#xD;
"T'hey don't go in couples now-do they,&#xD;
capting ?" asked Mr. Snaggs.&#xD;
No," said Ashton; "but I am afraid the&#xD;
company has had sense enough to get a man-of-&#xD;
war to convoy their treasure-ship. If so, the&#xD;
jig is up with us, and we iust keep well clear&#xD;
of them, or our bread will be baked. For,&#xD;
though we could disable and take one 'of their&#xD;
side-wheeled steamers, we are no match fir a&#xD;
man-of-war thrown in."&#xD;
"Goodness ! no!" said Mr. Snaggs, alarmed&#xD;
at the possibility before him.&#xD;
"I will go aloft and-take a look at the steam-&#xD;
ers, and yous may edge the brig up a little more to&#xD;
windward," said Ashton. " If my glass tell&#xD;

far enough for them to pass us without discov-'&#xD;
ering what we are. To make things more sure,&#xD;
run up the French flag That will be the least&#xD;
suspected."&#xD;
Snaggs hastened to obey, while Ashton went&#xD;
aloft.&#xD;
His inspection of the advancing steamers,&#xD;
which came rapidly toward them, was by no&#xD;
means satisfactory. In a little while, he shouted&#xD;
to Snaggs to brace up his yards and stand to&#xD;
the south-east-a course which would take them&#xD;
right away from the track of the coveted ves-&#xD;
sel.&#xD;
The crcw looked astounded ; for they were,&#xD;
in imagination, almost counting their prize-&#xD;
money.&#xD;
But when Ashton, coming on deck, told them&#xD;
that the treasure-ship was convoyed by a war-&#xD;
steamer of heavy force, which they could not&#xD;
hope to compete with without a terrible loss at&#xD;
best, and a fearful prospect of capture, they&#xD;
were glad to acknowledge the prudence which&#xD;
made him haul off.&#xD;
"Which course now, capting ?" asked Snaggs,&#xD;
a couple or three hours later, when the steam-&#xD;
ers were far away on their "homeward bound"&#xD;
career.&#xD;
"We'll heave about shortly, and run to the&#xD;
west of Cuba, and take the Gulf Stream up to&#xD;
the Carolin i Coast. We may take something&#xD;
bound fcom llavana or Matanzas, north ; and I&#xD;
must soon make a port for water. There are&#xD;
a dozen little ports on the Carolina Coast which&#xD;
are open yet, and I'll-risk my chances for one&#xD;
of theui."&#xD;
Accordingly, in a short time the brig was cast&#xD;
on the other tack, and took a northwesterly&#xD;
course.&#xD;
CHAPTER L.&#xD;
The cruise of Elmer Winchester was devoid&#xD;
of that interest which attaches to chases and bat-&#xD;
tles; for, with the exception of speakiing a cou-&#xD;
ple of our men-of war off the capes of Virginia,&#xD;
they did not see a single vessel on their route&#xD;
out. On the morning of the ninth day out, El-&#xD;
mer, hay ing run down his latitude according to&#xD;
his reckoni.ig, and finding, by the long lanes of&#xD;
gulf-weed floating on the water, that he was in&#xD;
the edge of the Gulf Stream, hauled in for the&#xD;
-coast. This he did not do without sonic mis-&#xD;
givings ; for there was every sign of a north-&#xD;
easterly gale, and a lee shore, or a harbor in the&#xD;
enemy's waters, were neither of them desirable&#xD;
alternatives&#xD;
But trusting in luck, or Providence-sailors&#xD;
often irreverently take them for the same ting&#xD;
-Elmer squared away, and about noon, or a lit-&#xD;
tle before, mde the land ahead. It was near, for&#xD;
the coast wrs low ; and within two or three&#xD;
hours, Frances Rutherford not only recognized&#xD;
.ever: I  ' ' ' uns, but actually de cried and&#xD;
&#xD;
pointed out the cupalo upon the top 'of her&#xD;
father's stately residence, lifting itself. tower-&#xD;
like, above a magnificent grove of magnolias.&#xD;
Hoisting French colors, to disguise his true&#xD;
character, and also running up a white flag for-&#xD;
ward, Elmer, boldly trusting to the pilotage of&#xD;
Frances, ran his schooner in over a bar which&#xD;
gave but little more water than she drew, and&#xD;
then stood up a narrow but pretty inlet into a&#xD;
miniature harbor, with good anchorage in front&#xD;
of Magnolia Grove.&#xD;
And in half an hour thereafter, Frances Ruth-&#xD;
erford, weeping with joy, threw herself into her&#xD;
father's arms, and introduced her friends, being&#xD;
careful not to betray the position which Elmer&#xD;
held.&#xD;
When Mr. Dinsmore was introduced, Mr.&#xD;
Rutherford regarded him very intently ; and&#xD;
while he welcomed him with all the noted&#xD;
warmth of Southern hospitality, could not re-&#xD;
frain from remarking that they had certainly&#xD;
met before, but he could not say where.&#xD;
"And now, my dear," said lie, to Frances,&#xD;
"you must make penance for all that I have&#xD;
suffered of anxiety on your account, by telling&#xD;
me where you have been, and what you have&#xD;
been doing. You left me to truant-like at Rich-&#xD;
mond, that I thought you had gone home. Buf;&#xD;
when I got here, you had not been heard of;&#xD;
and you can little imagine what I felt and fear-&#xD;
ed!"&#xD;
"I was very naughty, papa-very ! But I&#xD;
needed a lesson, and have taken it," said Fran-&#xD;
ces, as she kissed his pale and care-worn brow.&#xD;
"Open confession is good for the soul, it is&#xD;
said," she continued, " and I nay as well con-&#xD;
fess all my sin, and ask for absolution."&#xD;
"You shall have that before confession, my&#xD;
child," said her father,- fondly caressing her.&#xD;
"Now tell me where you went when you so sud-&#xD;
denly left me at Richmond."&#xD;
I went to sea, papa,' said Frances, demure-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
"To sea, child ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir. As an acting nidsliipman, I serv-&#xD;
ed on board the Confederate privateer ' Rattle-&#xD;
snake,' until I learned that Wiliam Ashton,&#xD;
her commander, instead of being what my ro-&#xD;
mantic fancy had painted him-a man of chiv-&#xD;
alric honor and patriotic courage-was a liber-&#xD;
tine and a villain. Then I took my discharge ;&#xD;
and, thanks to the friends who are now our&#xD;
guests, I am once more with you, cured of all&#xD;
romance, all desire to roam any more, and will-&#xD;
ing to settle down sedately by your side, mix&#xD;
your toddies, read or sing you to sleep, or per-&#xD;

"Which have increased terribly sinqe your&#xD;
