A NEW YORK STOR?,&#xD;
&#xD;
(.4)&#xD;
&#xD;
BOUT two hundred and three years ago, old Pe-&#xD;
ter Stuyvesant, assisted by his trumpeter, An-&#xD;
0 V                   thony Van Corlaer, reigned in this old town,&#xD;
which was'at that time a dependancy of Holland,&#xD;
ML l           and called .JVieuwe Amsterdam. The good old&#xD;
Peter was Governor thereafter seventeen years,&#xD;
and then 'the place fell into the hands of the,&#xD;
purse-proud English. Peter resigned the sep-&#xD;
tre, Anthony flung away 4he trumpet, aud Gov-&#xD;
ernor Nichols .succeeded. We do not intend to&#xD;
writers history of New York, and therefore we&#xD;
shall say a very little about the details of the&#xD;
great and marvellous changes which have been&#xD;
wrought in its history during the interval of Pe-&#xD;
ter Stnyvesant and Ambrose Kingslan1d, a period&#xD;
C     of just two centuries and three years. Piter&#xD;
had about,800 Low Dutch souls under h&#xD;
when he commenced, and as near as we can getat it, Ambrose has, about 800,000 f all inds of&#xD;
souls under his seal. These are a mixed breed. Some of the Dutch descendants are yetmo  S;&#xD;
They are considered about as ancient a breed es we have, and their claims to gentili  are pretty&#xD;
generally recognized. Their Book of Heraldry is Valentine's Manual, containing alist of the old&#xD;
Dutch settlers, aldermen, &amp;amp;c., during the Dutch regime. The Knickerbocker stock areproud of&#xD;
their ancestors, and clique it considerably on this account, though not one of the whole lot of the&#xD;
descendants can speak good honest Jhow Dutch, if it was to save one of the race from being hpg;&#xD;
Among these families there are still found the names of Stuyvesant, Beekman, Bleecker, Stky*&#xD;
ker, Anthony, Nevins Van Cowenhoven, Ruyter,'Roffman, Depeyster, Van Cortlandt; Schuylerj.&#xD;
c     ipp, Verplanek, De KaDyckman, Vermilyca, Benson, Van Schaick -Van&#xD;
Zandt, De Forest, Vanlyff, Mprvins, Le Roy, Gouveneur, Backer, Stenwyok. _Vense, Crigier,&#xD;
Laurens, Van Brugger,Wyekoffi Van Waggener, Van Horn, Van Vleck, Van Rensselaer, atid some&#xD;
others we wot not of.&#xD;
This town never began to trael at all until the English got hold of it, and even then it did no&#xD;
move very rapidly, for in 1790, (one hundred years after,) it only had a populationof 10,000.&#xD;
After the Revolution, when the Americans got possession, and after our glorious Federal Union&#xD;
was consummated, and the seat of government was sent off to Washington, the Empire City began&#xD;
to walk. Untrammeled and independent, sustained only by her commerce, she sprang at once on&#xD;
the track, and in a very shortntime got ahead woPhiadelphia, and took her titleof the great em-&#xD;
porium of the United Statesj and one which she will retain so long,'as the Union hplds together.,&#xD;

&#xD;
After-the war of the Revolutiou, we bad in addition to the old Dutch and English breed, other&#xD;
kinds, and at present New York-is iade up of citizens from every part of God's-earth. All races&#xD;
and all nations are represented here. The blood of the old aboriginies, the European, the Asiatic,&#xD;
&amp;amp;nd the African, flows in the veins of our citizens. The European and the African predominates.&#xD;
The latter is easily classified into black and yellow. The European is from the Dutch, English,&#xD;
French, German, Spanish, Irish; Welch, Scotch, and every other kind, and a large nUmber retain&#xD;
through years the traces off their distinctive origin.&#xD;
The Jews'are found here in large quantities, and from every European nation, but laying claim&#xD;
to the peculiarities of none, except the nation which closed its existence at the time of the cruci-&#xD;
fxion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. The Asiatic and Indian races have no cliques or cir-&#xD;
cles in society, and we have nothing to say about them. We shall have more to say about these&#xD;
races and clique as our story progresses. We hasten now to commence it.&#xD;
Any event cce., cted with commerce or markets must necessarily affect New York in all its&#xD;
length and breadth, from the Battery to Harlem Bridge, from the North River and Jersey city to&#xD;
the East River, and Brooklyn and Williamsburgh. Our tale must open in the memorable year'&#xD;
*hen cotton rose from twelve cents for ordinary New Orleans to eighteen cents per pound. All of&#xD;
our commercial readers who read this history will remember that year of the cottoti rise, and con,&#xD;
sequent speculations, and it is very important that they should do so.&#xD;
On a beautiful summer afternoon, in the month of July, one of the ferry boats left the foot of&#xD;
Barclay street for Hoboken. The day had been unusually warm for even that month of the year;&#xD;
the thermometer at Lynch and Clark's, in Wall street, stood at 98, and the brokers, speculators,&#xD;
and moneyed men of the Street, the great men on 'Change, hurried out of that hot den of iniquity&#xD;
and wickedness a little before three, in order to breathe the pure air and the fresh, invigorating&#xD;
breeze which is found at the Elysian Fields, in company with their families, for a short time, and&#xD;
then be enabled to return to the city before evening set in, when all the loafers and rowdies would&#xD;
be crowding on to the ferry boat to return also.&#xD;
The ferry boat, on this occasion, had hardly cleared the long piles that protect the dock at that&#xD;
ferry, before a stranger on board of her would have had his attention riveted upon one particular&#xD;
family, although the boat was crowded with men, women, boys, girls, and even little' squalling&#xD;
brats of babies taken along to enliven the scene with their sweet voices, and (to their particular&#xD;
parents) most delightful music. There were a great many fashionable people on board, beside the&#xD;
family to Which we have alluded, which consisted 6f a father, mother, and two extremely lovely&#xD;
daughters. The gayest of the two was a very beautiful girl, just entering upon her teens, whose&#xD;
whole soul and attention seemed to be absorbed by a large, black, shaggy dog, of the Newfound-&#xD;
lad species, who was wandering about the deck of the ferry boat, apparently without any owner&#xD;
or master. The dog appeared to be ready for a regular built lark with anybody who would notice&#xD;
him, and was not at all shy of scraping an acquaintance when he discovered that -the little maid&#xD;
was desirous of cultivating a friendship with him. She, on her part, when she ascertained that he&#xD;
was good-natured, would bear patting, and didn't seem at all inclined to bite, commenced a series of&#xD;
caresses, which the intelligent animal received both gratefully and gracefully. After he had wag-&#xD;
gOthis tail a few times, rolled over once or twice, all the time keeping his eyes'steadily fixed upon&#xD;
her, he placed his'big, cold nose upon her lap, and they were friends at once. The introduction&#xD;
had taken place, and they felt that they were on speaking terms. The dog had about his big neck&#xD;
a brass collar. No sooner did thief attract the attention of the young girl than she began to examine&#xD;
it, and aftetsome spelling, she made out and pronounced the word " Beppo." The dog started,&#xD;
sad looked at her with some surprise, which said as plainly as words could have done, "How the&#xD;
dickens do you know my name ?"&#xD;
"His name is Beppo, mother," said the pleased girl.&#xD;
"Beppo, child ?-whose name. is Beppo ?" was asked by a fat, dowdy looking sort of female, whom&#xD;
the girl had addressed by the sweet name of mother.&#xD;
I-s," pointing to the dog. "May not he be my dog, mother ?"&#xD;
"COome away directly from that horrid beast ; he'll bite you."&#xD;
" Oh, no, mamna, he won't. See,- he wants to play with me. Beppo, Bep," continued the child,&#xD;
as the noble animal commenced a series of playful movements when he heard his name so famili-.&#xD;
arly spoken by the little lady, and she paid no further attention to mama. Master JBeppo had&#xD;
completely captivated her young affections.&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.                                     6&#xD;
There was another person who stood near the group we have been describing, and he was notan&#xD;
inattentive observer of what was passing. His dark eyes had not wandeiredfrom the beautiful&#xD;
features of the young girl; he had watched the progress of her acquaintance withthe  animal,&#xD;
and it was quite evident to another spectator that he felt pleased at the result He was leaning&#xD;
against the rail, occasionally noticing the lady who was addressed as mafta, with another still&#xD;
younger girl than the first seated by her side, when he was startled from his reverie by the ques-&#xD;
tion, Is that your dogyoung man" He took a close look of the questioner. It was the father&#xD;
of the young l"dy-Iy stout, thick set man, short in stature, apparently about forty-five or fifty&#xD;
years of age, with large, bushy eyebrows, and features of a very ordinary kind.&#xD;
"It is, sir," replied the youth addressed, " and a very fine dog he is."&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
"I thought he was your dog," was the further remark of the father.  7ahe youface, was i-&#xD;
dently not over seventeen years of age. He was till, well made up a very pe f aker foi -&#xD;
lectual forehead, a keen, piercing eye, and hair as black as jet.d theregardedthe speke fota&#xD;
moment with a look expressive of the niost supreme contempt, an  elat, ilehit&#xD;
his serious features, as though at that 'instant he remembered the relations -hieh this *i014S&#xD;
grained, pompous man stood to the lovely child who was romping withhsi frta he  e rm h&#xD;
him in a subdued tome, "Indsed, I supposed you arrived at that conclusion'fom tltcuk"06c&#xD;
that I have been constantly watching his'movements."&#xD;
&#xD;
ell&#xD;
&#xD;

6                                qLARENCE BOLTON.'&#xD;
"Perhaps so. However, I did kndw that he was your dog. Nobody but a Dale faced, melan-&#xD;
choly looking youth, like you, would own such an ugly dog as that."&#xD;
What reply such a brutal remark might have called forth, we will not venture to suppose. There&#xD;
was an angry flush passed rapidly over the brow of the young man; but before he could reply, a&#xD;
scream was heard, and the young girl was missing. The dog stood at the end of the boat alone,&#xD;
and was watching some object in the water, and hesitating, as if undecided what to do next, or&#xD;
waiting for his young master. 1le did not have to wait long. The youth no sooner heard the&#xD;
scream, than he comprehended it all in a moment. He cast off his coat, called to the dog, "Come,&#xD;
Beppo," and jumped off the end of the boat into the.river, and was soon seen making his way to-&#xD;
wards a spot in the river where the white dress of the girl was quite visible, and followed by the&#xD;
dog. All was confusion on board of the ferry boat, "Girl overboard !" was sung out by every-&#xD;
body. The mother fiainted, and was carried into the ladies' cabin, but the father and the younger&#xD;
sister, Lydia, continued to watch the parties in the water, but neither spoke. At last the cry rose&#xD;
from every one of the anxious spectators, "He has got her ;" but all this while the distance was&#xD;
increasing between the ferry boat and those in the water. The efforts made to get back to the spot&#xD;
where the girl went over only made matters worse. Ferry boats were even more unmanageable in&#xD;
those days than they are now. The parties overboard were in the middle of the river, the tide was&#xD;
ebbing, and they were drifting down the river. The alarm on board partially subsided, when they&#xD;
discovered that the young man was swimming, and sustaining, by the help of the dog, both himself&#xD;
and the girl above water. Then the master of the ferry boat headed her for the ferry house, on&#xD;
the New York side, as he found it useless to attempt to reach them with the clumsy old machine.&#xD;
We will leave the ferry boat and go to the drowning party. The young girl, in her gambols&#xD;
with Beppo, had approached to the stern end of the boat, but was too much occupied with him to&#xD;
observe that she was in any danger, and in avoiding his rather rough caresses she stepped back.&#xD;
ward and found herself in the water, and the boat rapidly leaving her. She screamesl as she fell,&#xD;
and it seemed but a moment ere the young man followed her, but even in that time the boat had&#xD;
got some distance from her, and he had to exert himself. He kicked off his shoes, and after a few&#xD;
vigorous strokes of his arm he was by her side, -and so was Beppo. She was half drowned, and&#xD;
completely frightened and bewildered. He sustained her head above water, with one arm about&#xD;
her, until she partially recovered, and could comprehend him when he said, "Don't get scared;&#xD;
you are in no danger." and when he had re-assured her, he added, "Now, let go'of me for a mo-&#xD;
ment, and then put your arm around my neck, and I will support and swim with you upon my&#xD;
back."   This was soon arranged, and having both hands now free, he placed himself with&#xD;
his head to the north, and made no exertion to swim, but merely to keep above water, and then&#xD;
floated with the tide. He knew enough about tides to know that to .swim against it would soon&#xD;
exhaust and drown him. Instinct taught Beppo to do the same, and when the young man got one&#xD;
arm over the back of the powerful dog, while using the ether to keep above water, the party were&#xD;
qtiite easy and comfortable. He was perfectly calm alnd composed, and his conduct inspired her&#xD;
with confidence. "There will be lots of boats.out very quick to pick us up," said he.&#xD;
"Oh dear, I don't see any; I amafraid we will be drowned. What shall we do ?"&#xD;
"Nonsense, we are not going to be drowned. Boats will come out as soon as we are discovered&#xD;
in the water."&#xD;
"I hope so. What made you come in the water ?",&#xD;
"To save you from being drowned, which you would have been before this if I had not. Bless&#xD;
your darling little heart, I would rather be drowned with you, than to have stopped on board and&#xD;
seen you perish alone; but there is no danger now, Beppo and me will keep you and us up until we&#xD;
get help."&#xD;
"How come you to know that I was overboard ?"&#xD;
"I heard you scream; I had, been watching you play with Beppo, and missed you,"J&#xD;
" How very good of you. Is Beppo your 'dog ? Won't he get drowned ?" .&#xD;
" Oh no, he likes the fun ; he is used to it. He and me have swam three miles and more many&#xD;
a time-but look at that bungling ferry boat-the fools--why don't they get to the landing and&#xD;
-send out a small boat after us ? Hang me if I think anybody on shore sees us ; however, -it is ra.-&#xD;
ther pleasant. Beppo, old dog, how do you feel, ek ?" -&#xD;
Beppo wagged his tail and yelped; ho couldn't raise a respectable bark. His young master un.-&#xD;
derstood him, however.&#xD;
"Oh, it's all my fault-what is your name ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
*1&#xD;
&#xD;
M"ly name? Clarence."&#xD;
Clarence-that is a pretty name; but that aint all your name, is it ?"&#xD;
"No, my family name is-Bolton. Now what is your name, my little fairy ?"&#xD;
"Fanny."&#xD;
"Fanny what ?"&#xD;
"Fanny Gould."&#xD;
"And that old gentleman on board the ferry boat was old Bob Gould, eh ?"&#xD;
"Who?"&#xD;
"Mr. Gould, the rich broker in Wall street."&#xD;
"Do you know my father ?"&#xD;
"Never saw him before to-day, but I've heard of him often. Bless my soul, but this is getting&#xD;
serious; I'm getting exhausted. Can you hold on to Beppo a few moments ?"&#xD;
Fanny did as she was de-&#xD;
V~ sired, and Clarence aided her&#xD;
4 in keeping on the back of the&#xD;
dog; not a soul seemed to be&#xD;
astir, as they floated down&#xD;
with the tide ; they had pass -&#xD;
ed Castle Garden, and Clar-&#xD;
ence began to get seriously       _              _&#xD;
alarmed, and made up his                                                               --&#xD;
mind that when they got a-                                                              -&#xD;
breast of Governor's Island&#xD;
it would be his last chance,&#xD;
and that he would then&#xD;
exert  all  his. remaining                                -&#xD;
strength to get ashore. He -&#xD;
knew that if she could hold&#xD;
on to Beppo, and keep her-&#xD;
hedd above water,.she was&#xD;
safe, for the dog would swim                                             ZZI&#xD;
after himself wherever he                                                                    -&#xD;
should go.&#xD;
Now, Fanny, this is the&#xD;
last chance to save our-&#xD;
selves from drowning, for there is no sign of help from the shore," said Clarence to the little&#xD;
maid, when they were opposite to Castle William, and the tide or current had carried them as&#xD;
near the Island as possible, and he knew they would be no nearer. "Hold tight td Beppo, and&#xD;
don't let go your hold, even if you should see me drown before your eyes.' We will make a swim&#xD;
in earnest now, and .as sure as we get out of the strong current we will be safe. Can yqu keep&#xD;
hold of the dog ?"&#xD;
"I'll try my best."&#xD;
And now Clarence, who was almost worn out by the exertions he unad used to keep hi own as&#xD;
well as Fanny's head above water, made a desperate effort to get out of the current and reach the&#xD;
island. . The dog perfectly understood vhat was to be done, and paddled away with both paws as&#xD;
if he was swimming for a wager. It was a hard struggle, but at last, when he felt that all was&#xD;
nearly over, they neared the land and Clarence just touched bottom. Then he swam back and&#xD;
aided Fanny, took her in his arms and wided up to dry ground, and lid down on the green grass&#xD;
completely overpowered. They were safe and he was grateful, and so was Fanny. They remained'&#xD;
but a short time on that spot, but as soon as they had rested a little from their fatigue, they walk-&#xD;
ed across the Island to the dock were the boats start from. The government barge was just&#xD;
leaving, and after some explanation, they were rowed across to.'the Castle Garden bridge. Mr.&#xD;
Gould was there, and so was his wife and Lydia. They had rushed from the ferry boat (after-&#xD;
sending out a row boat) to the barge office at Whitehall. There, by means *ef a spy-glass, t5ey&#xD;
saw them get ashore at Governor's Island and knew they were safe. 'When Mr. Gould sawr&#xD;

For a moment Clarence was stupified. Then&#xD;
he did take the coin, and indignantly threw it&#xD;
down upon the bridge, bade them good bye, and&#xD;
hurried across to the Battery.&#xD;
- "Mr. Gould followed with his family. Fanny&#xD;
was weeping. He merely said "Fan,,l think that&#xD;
young chap is crazy."&#xD;
Fanny didn't open her blessed lips, but she&#xD;
thought deeply upon the subject, and continued to think about it until she reached home.&#xD;

was in her mother's arms.&#xD;
A nice business this, sir," was Mr. Gould&#xD;
first greeting, "and all on account of that dog&#xD;
of yours. Here-" (and Mr. Gould drew Fan-&#xD;
ny's arm within his own, and handed Clarence--&#xD;
half a dollar,) "here," said he, "is something&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
CONTENTS--The descendants of English and nuguenot families-the mongrel clase-early career of Mr. Gould-Poor*Uo4se&#xD;
-Sale of the Poor-floraler-Going into business-Marriage.&#xD;
EFORE the commencement of our story, or,&#xD;
rather, before presenting to our readers the&#xD;
characters already introduced, we should have&#xD;
said morerespecting the other principal classes of&#xD;
people that made up this city, or its population,&#xD;
after the Revolutionary war. We have spoken&#xD;
of the Dutch and their descendants, and we&#xD;
must now say a few words in reference to the&#xD;
English class. A great many of the leading&#xD;
families in this community claim a certain rank&#xD;
from being descended from old Englishfamilies,&#xD;
who emigrated to this country previous to the&#xD;
Revolution, and who, have some claims to the&#xD;
respect of the community from their antiquity.&#xD;
They remained here while the war was pending,&#xD;
and most of them, during that period, were to-*&#xD;
ries or neutral. When peace was declared, they&#xD;
then mixed up with all the other classes as American citizens-past    political differences&#xD;
were forgotten-they engaged in the same kind of active business, and their descendants retain&#xD;
none of the original bitterness of the race, though most of .them still possess a respec-&#xD;
table quantity of English pride and prejudice. With this old tory class of the come&#xD;
munity, which existed in this city after the war of the Revolution, was found another&#xD;
class, equally descendants from the English stock, but they reached New York in a different&#xD;
way.   These were the primitive race of English that came to this continent and origi-&#xD;
nally peopled New England, and afterwards were the pioneers in the events that led to the inde-&#xD;
pendence of these colonies, and their descendants found their way to New York, via New England,&#xD;
and became the pioneers of commerce. Of this English, but purita descent, we have still&#xD;
among us- of the same names-and directly descended from     the true American breed, such&#xD;
families as Althorp, Alsop, Kent, Jay, Livingston, Laight,. Lawrence, Hicks, Bache, Phoenix,&#xD;
Milkey, Post, Perit, Thurston, Jones, Wetmore, Woodward, Haydock, Reese, Lott, Glover, Bard,&#xD;
Levison, Walton, Wolsey, Fleming, Delancey, Marshall, Preston, Gibbs, Deming, Clarkson,&#xD;
Fuller, Newbold, Beach, Aspinwall, Waddington, Brooks, Lenox, Barclay, Hutchings, Goodhue,&#xD;
Grinnell, Ogden, Davis, Macy, Dixon, King, Sands, Morton, Roy, Lester, Hudson, Whitloch, and&#xD;
hundreds of others.&#xD;
There were emigrants here from,France prior to the Revolution, who settled in this vicinity&#xD;
%fter the Edict of Nantz. They were Huguenots, and their descendants are found scattered&#xD;
through the city.   Some of them   are the Lorillards, Demaret, Seguines, Mesiers, Dela-&#xD;
laines, Latourettes, D la Montagnes, Jumels, Depaus, Devaus, De Rhams, Duers, and many&#xD;
others ;&#xD;
After the Revolution, thousands poured into this city from other States of the confederacy, as&#xD;
Ivell as from countries abroad, sprang into notice, and acquired fortunes after Peace was esta-&#xD;
blished, whose origin is not known or cared about. Their wealth has enabled them to overtop all&#xD;
claims of birth or talent. They have married into what are called the old families, and hold un-&#xD;
disputed sway in what is called the fashionable world, or the upper crust society of the dity. This&#xD;
class were, generally speaking, a hard working, industrious, economical, prudent,,money-making&#xD;
set of'merchants, mechanics, and shopkeepers, who arrived in the-great city from other States&#xD;
and nations, without a blessed copper in their pockets, and they have succeeded and become the&#xD;
rich or copper class of the community. Success has enabled them to pass as current as a more&#xD;
valuable coin, though of lesser size.&#xD;
It was to this class our rich broker, Mr. Gould, belonged, and as he is a gentleman that will&#xD;
figure pretty extensively in this wonk, which will be devoted to a faithful idscription of the&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7713-00000006"/>&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.&#xD;
manners and habits of Irominent classes, of which his class 'includes a very large and imposing&#xD;
bpdy of individuals in this city, we will give his history, as a sample, of a great many&#xD;
others of the tribe.&#xD;
His class are not enumerated in what we have already written, either specifically or generally,&#xD;
as neither the old low Dutch, the English p "'tan, or tory breed, or any other, car1 lay claimywith&#xD;
any degree of certainty to the species. Its a mongre class that have no known or established&#xD;
origin.* The names of grand-parentsare c tainly notwritten in'the family bibles of but very&#xD;
few of this class. In fact, the imprint oft ir family bibles contain the names of the "Harpers"&#xD;
or other cotemporaneous book and bible publishers. This class grow well and flourish best when&#xD;
planted in city soil, and more particularly in a city that contains a Wall street. It is a a delightful&#xD;
hot-bed for the growth of hearty, though very common plants. To designate this species, we&#xD;
bill call them the mongrel class. It is composed of men who have acquired wealth and conse-&#xD;
quent distinction, from blundering stupidity and lucky circumstances, rather than from honest,&#xD;
legitimate business talent, industry, and comprehensive, extended mercantile combinations.hThis&#xD;
class cannot boast of family or personal qualities, or attainments. They have no claim by birth,&#xD;
cleverness, occupation, habits or manners, to the title of gentlemen, which they assume. Success&#xD;
-wealth-has stamped the word merit on their character and fortunes. The stamp is good, and&#xD;
passes -current all over the town, and no 'one pretends to dispute or contest the claims of this&#xD;
class to assume any position they desire. Wealth!' The man who possesses that in this commu-&#xD;
nity, has i4 his possession the one thing needful on this earth, no matter what Holy Writ says&#xD;
about it. It is a passport endorsed as good by public opinion, and enables the lucky possessor to&#xD;
travel every where among us. It opens the doors of every house-it purchases the best seats in&#xD;
the temple of God.'The minister at his altar comes more speedily, when summoned to a death.&#xD;
bed in the rich man's house, and the carriage of the man of medicine stands longer and oftener at&#xD;
its portals. The learned in law are ever at the beck and call of the rich-villian, though the&#xD;
rich may be-and though the poor and bereft of all, save right, be sueing for redress against him.&#xD;
The boxes and best seats at the opera, concert, or theatre, are open to him and his. The mind&#xD;
and the intellect of those to whom God has awarded the five talents, are at the command of him&#xD;
to whom le has not given one.&#xD;
1Oh, how far distant is it from our intention in these forthcoming chapters to decry or hold up to&#xD;
levity or ridicule any man, or class of men, who have risen to either fortune, or position, or both,&#xD;
by a course of steady, persevering industry, and honesty in any pursuit or profession. Such de-&#xD;
serve, and- will-ever receive, from our pen the highest and most marked commendations; but when&#xD;
we find men of the mongrel class, of which we now write-men who have never traveled any of&#xD;
these legitimate avenues to fame, fortune, or position-men who can boast of no ancestry, no past&#xD;
services of their own or their progenitors, to the human race, the country, or to the city in which&#xD;
they reside-men who can only point to the piles of money they have hoarded up, or the real&#xD;
estate which they own as their only claim to position, and a commanding influence in our city-&#xD;
men that mere success has caused. to be proud, overbearing, and tyrannical to their superiors in -&#xD;
every respect, save money-despisers of the weak, the poor, and the humble-ay, of their own ori-&#xD;
gin. A class, who, instead of extending a friendly hand, or speaking a kind and gentle word to&#xD;
those around them, who are striving to get along, and earn their daily bread for themselves and&#xD;
their families, are the ones who strive by high rents, exorbitant interest, and in a thousand other&#xD;
ways, to crush, oppress, overburden them still more, and trample them under their feet..-'Again&#xD;
we apologize, and say, that it may not be without its uses to give somewhat in detail the early career&#xD;
of one of this class; to go back to his original position, trace his career rapidly through a series&#xD;
of years, until he bursts forth upon soeiety, the respected nabob the millionaire among us, to&#xD;
whom all bend and bow, and give place, from the humble, hungry, half-starved Lazarus, he orders&#xD;
kicked from his basement area, up to the minister of  od's house, whom he allows to come and&#xD;
wine with himt occasionally, and to christen, marry, and bury his children, if he preaches accord-&#xD;
ing to what his (the rich man's) ideas of 'a god and religion may happen to be. We hav6 no doubt&#xD;
that it will prove very useful and instructive to this class o,f our citizens to hold up to their vision&#xD;
a fair and just sample of their own peculiar class. They may discover in the picture their owia&#xD;
matter lyorthlessness, deformity, and hideousness. As one of this class, we will now give a sketch&#xD;
of the birth, parentage, and early career of Robert Gould, the rich and respectable Wall street&#xD;
boker and operator, previous to his introduction to ou0 edr  nbadteHbknfrybas&#xD;

There is still retained in many portions of our land a hortid custom clled "farming ot the&#xD;
Therens poo" resied ciytp of those who are aged and helpless, and who have no friends or means&#xD;
of existence, or of others who are destitute, and reduced to want by'sickness or any other cause.&#xD;
f eist mo uol ot        ard yet it exists in our blessed land. On a certain day of every year&#xD;
all the poor of a town or village, having been previously catalogued, those helpless onies are op-&#xD;
lected together, by  th select men to be farmed out by auction. It is stated in this catalogue&#xD;
what are their respective ages, their health, and what they are able to do. When the vendue is to&#xD;
come off, the townlercries out to the towns people, "The town of A is about to farm out the poor,&#xD;
how much will any one give to take the whole lot, consisting of nine men, women and children, as&#xD;
h    c     y be?" Then the bidding commences. One says $200, another $160, and another&#xD;
$the cand the last being the lowest, agreeing to take them the cheapest, is the successful bidder,&#xD;
adis announced byname as esh. Then begin thecomments of the unsuccessful bidders, and by-&#xD;
standers. Hard lot at that price," says one. "Must lose on 'em," says another, "No such&#xD;
thing-will make by the job, for thy will aldie."  "No, they won't; all will live, and provisions&#xD;
are very high.'" That is nthig;, seven of these men cana earn day wages all the year rouud.".&#xD;
rvTom Brigs kows how to work em out. He will have two-thirds of 'em in white pine boxes,&#xD;
after haying and harvesting is over. Tom ain't a going to winter all them chaps."&#xD;
It was at a similar sale of the " towns poor" such as we have described, which took place in the&#xD;
village of B., in the year 179-, that there might have been seen, if any of our readers had have&#xD;
been there, an ignorant, silly, half-witted woman, about twenty-eight years of age. She was for&#xD;
Sale rmong the town's poor, as was also her son, a lad of nine about years of age, both of&#xD;
whom were standing in the group to be disposed of.&#xD;
&#xD;
In her teens, Nancy tould-for that was this poor woman s name-had evidently posseoed&#xD;
ome claims to beauty. She was simple, and ignorant,'never having received any kind offinfr-&#xD;
mation, but having een allowed to run uncultivated about the place. Her parents had long been&#xD;
dead. She had made-her home at the village tavern, from the time she was five years of age untij&#xD;
she was eighteen, earning a living by'her work. When she was about the last age, a traveling&#xD;
tin pedlar was passing through the town, and put up at the tavern for several days. During his&#xD;

stay he became attracted by the pretty features of Nancy, and a present of a few articles of gilt&#xD;
jewelry, captured the poor girl's heart, she became his victim, and the result may be conjectured.&#xD;
Some months elapsed after'the pedlar had taken his departure, and poor N4ancy Gould became an&#xD;
object of scorn and contempt to all the good&#xD;
people of the town. There was but one house&#xD;
open to receive her, end that was the place for&#xD;
the " town poor." In that old rookery, kept&#xD;
by the poor.house keeper, Mr. Skinner, she gave&#xD;
birth to a son, who was named Robert, and for&#xD;
years he and his mother had been inntates of&#xD;
"Robert Skinner's poor-house."&#xD;
&#xD;
In the year of which we speak, when Robert&#xD;
had become nine years of age, and capable of&#xD;
-__     ~    --doing something, the man who bought the poor&#xD;
-___that year had, previously to doing so, or to the&#xD;
sale, sold Master Bob, or rather hired him&#xD;
out until he should reach twenty-one, to a well&#xD;
known New England horse jockey, who annu-&#xD;
ally made his appearance in that village to pur-&#xD;
chase up horses for the West India markets.&#xD;
A month after the poor-house auction that&#xD;
year we find Master Robert a stable boy in one of the Atlantic cities. Poor as he was he had&#xD;
found means to pay for going to the District School teacher at odd hours, and he could rcai&#xD;
and write, was active and industrious in his new vocation, and when he reached the age of seven-&#xD;
teen was the best hostler in the place.&#xD;

his employer, in regard to his honesty, good moral character, and capabilities, as a coachman ; and&#xD;
with that and his little capital, he made his way to New York. Here was a field for the exercise&#xD;
of his peculiar talents. Here he was destined to shine. He got a situation, but not astcoachman.&#xD;
A grocery merchant hired him as a porter in his store. He learned that business amazingly&#xD;
quick, and by the time he was twenty-two, he had bought out his 'employer, (who was a small&#xD;
corner grocer,) and hoisted his own shingle as the successor. Money now began to pour in. Then&#xD;
there was money to be made in other transactions, and this decided his course. He had instinctive&#xD;
feelings for handling money, so he sold out his grocery--rented a basement cellar down town-it&#xD;
*as in Wall street, and two years after he was one of the most active little money brokers run-&#xD;
ning up and down the street. He was an object of some interest to a great many principals. His&#xD;
associates were many of them gentlemen-needy men will always associate with those who have&#xD;
wealth-and Bob Gould had it, or the way and means to get it for his friends, or th ' who could&#xD;
raise any kind of security. God help needy gentlemen who fell into his clutches. But he never&#xD;
lost by such'people. No-he was too keen and shrewd for that.&#xD;
After Mr. Gould had been in the brokerage business a few years, and had made thousands, he&#xD;
became acquainted with a young man, who was descended from the ancient Dutch stock we have&#xD;
alluded to. They were proud and poor. The, young man had a sister-Bob liked her. She was&#xD;
not handsome, not even good looking-short, thick, and stout, and she had no money; but there&#xD;
was a fair prospect that she would have some day, a very valuable property, if real estate should&#xD;
rise and her brother die, which seemed very probable, as he was one of the fastest young men of&#xD;
those days. But, tbove all, she was a blooded animal and had the best sort of family connections,&#xD;
and that was what Gould wanted, for he had none. the match was made, and Mr..Gould became&#xD;
the head of a family, and rented a dwelling house for them. Then followed one partnership after&#xD;
another, and rapid increase of business until he made afirm that every one knocked under to in&#xD;
Wall street. He was the great broker. Sons and daughters were growing up about him, and his&#xD;
family had become the leadingbne 'in fashionable circles-the fashionable class-of the citizens&#xD;
of this modern Babel. Bravo, Bob. Water will find its own level, and so will the genius of a&#xD;
money-mker! Stch is a rapid outline of the early career of Robert Gould up to the time when,&#xD;
we introduced him, and a portion of his family, to our readers, on board the Hoboken ferry boat,&#xD;
as we have described in a previous chapter.&#xD;
&#xD;
A few months afterward he purchased his time of the livery stable keeper and horse jockey, and&#xD;
at once entered into the service of a wealthy merchant, as coachman. At twenty, Bob had saved&#xD;
considerable money. He was grasping, greedy, and not at all squeamish as to how he got it. ' By&#xD;
a thOusand ways, only known to cunning boys, he had turned many an honest penny, and had&#xD;
stowed away in an old hair trunk, which he had bought for twenty-five cents, the little sum of&#xD;
two hundred and fifty dollars. His ambition longed for a new and more extensive field of opera-&#xD;
tions, where his genius would have fair play, so he procured a certificate of recommendation from&#xD;

CONTENTS-.anhattan Irsland-resideace of Madame Clarin-return home of Clarence and Beppb--relation of his adven-&#xD;
tures with Fanny-hidtoty of Madame Claria's family-their acquaintance with Edward iolton, Clarence's&#xD;
fakther-courts'hip and marriage of Edward Bolton and Julie loria.&#xD;
OMPARATIVELY speaking the Island on which&#xD;
our city is built has not changed in its location&#xD;
or outlines since its first discovery, when the red&#xD;
man, who roamed over it, called it Manhattan.&#xD;
Manhattan Island it is still called, but on what&#xD;
was once the whole island, there was a spot well&#xD;
remembered by many of our old citizens, which&#xD;
was locally known as 14,Manhattan Island" and&#xD;
is still called soby many who reside in that por-&#xD;
tion of the city. It was a little island in what is&#xD;
now the 11th Ward, though it has long since been&#xD;
filled up, and the 11th Ward is a dense portion&#xD;
of the city, now crowded with population, Such&#xD;
was not the fact at the time our story opens.&#xD;
~____          At that time tkere were few houses in that por-&#xD;
tion of the city. The "Island" was standing,&#xD;
and, as a matter of course, surrounded by water.&#xD;
It is now hardly remembered, except by the old&#xD;
residents, but they invariably speak of tlat por-&#xD;
tion of the city, the 11th Ward. as Manhattin Island. This Ward contains many objects of in-&#xD;
terest. The large ship-yards, the great foundries, &amp;amp;c., are located in that Ward on the East&#xD;
river. It has within its limits a mdgnificent promenade ground known as Tompkins Square.&#xD;
Should any of our readers ever visit the old 11th, they will find just below the Union Market in&#xD;
Houston street, the commencement of Manhattan Alley, which. leads into Third street, almbst di-&#xD;
rectly opposite one end of that alley they may notice, if it is still standing, a small two story house&#xD;
with a heavy pitched roof, two large dormer windows, with rather a heavy dore cornice. On the 2d&#xD;
story, three windows resting on a piazza, supported by four small columns, which shelters the&#xD;
first story. Running the extent of the piazza is a wooden bench 'directly under the parlor win-&#xD;
dows. The door is protected by a Venetian outer door, the heavy shutters are painted green.'&#xD;
Underneath is an area, the entrance to which is by the side, consisting of a small flight of stone&#xD;
steps. There is a yard&#xD;
surrounding the house,&#xD;
but-in front, immediately&#xD;
covering the area, is a&#xD;
wooden platform  and a&#xD;
covered way leading to an                         I&#xD;
arch gate way,and in front&#xD;
a row of palings. About&#xD;
the centre of the front is               L&#xD;
a large elm tree.&#xD;
The house-that we have                -&#xD;
described was situated on               -&#xD;
the northern side of what&#xD;
was then    denominated&#xD;
Manhattan   Island, and&#xD;
within a stone's throw of&#xD;
it. In this identical house                                  -&#xD;
Mrs:Blolton resided, and                       I ,&#xD;
it was here Clarence was -&#xD;
born.  Mark the house---&#xD;
well reader, and as we&#xD;
proceed with our work you&#xD;
&#xD;
.V&#xD;
&#xD;
'will learn the history of that quaint old. house. At the time of which we write, the house pre-&#xD;
seated a more striking appearance than it now does. Then it stood alone, there was no other&#xD;
house in the vicinity, The rest of the property about was unenclosed and apparently a common,&#xD;
covered with little puddles and overrun with Jamestown weed.&#xD;
Just as twilight commenced at the closing of that day, when the rich broker Mr. Gould and&#xD;
Clarence Bolton parted in anger on the bridge t Castle Garden, after having saved Fanny Gould&#xD;
from drowning, the latter entered the gate to his mother's residence, followed by tefaithful Beppo.&#xD;
The mother had no sooner perceived him, than she exclaimed, in alarm:&#xD;
"Why Clarence, where have you been ? you are wet through! H ave you fallen into the river ?"&#xD;
"Yes, dear mother, I have been in the river, although I did not fall in; and a precious time I&#xD;
have had of it. What an old .beast, to be sure !"&#xD;
"My son!"&#xD;
"Forgive me, dear mother; I was thinking of Fanny's father., He her father! What a shame&#xD;
it is that such a rough, surly old miser should be her father !"&#xD;
"Clarence, what are you talking about! Who is he, and who is Fanny ?"&#xD;
"The sweet little girl that fell off from the ferry boat, isother.'&#xD;
"My dear child, where are your wits gone ? Come inside and sit down by mother, and tell her&#xD;
all abott it. Bless me you have a fever! (and she placed her hand lovingly on his forehead.)-&#xD;
What has excited you in this manner. Now tell me all about it."&#xD;
The affectionate boy was soon calmed down by the gentle voice of his mother, and-then he nar-&#xD;
rated to her all that had occurred from the time heIhad left college that afternoon to go over to&#xD;
Hoboken to get fresh air, look upon green fields, have a stroll in the woods, and listen to the songs&#xD;
of the birds, until he parted with Mr. Gould and his family at the Castle Garden bridge. As he&#xD;
proc6eded with the simple story, the mother became more and more interested ; and, when she&#xD;
learned the full extent of the danger to which her gallant boy had exposed-'himsel' to save the&#xD;
life of a fellow creature, though'a stranger to him, she wept, and asked, "What would poor mother&#xD;
have done, Clarence, all alone in the world,'as she would'have been left, if my darling boy had&#xD;
been drowned ?" As the thought was expressed in words, she raised her eyes in thankfulness to&#xD;
God in silent gratitude that so awful a catastrophe had been spared her; and addressing Clarence,&#xD;
-she added:&#xD;
"Go at once, my son, to your own room, and change your wet clothes for dry ones; go n9w,&#xD;
for fear of catching a cold, and while you are absent, I will go into the kitchen and make you a cup&#xD;
of hot tea. Come, Beppo, will you go with your old mistress and get some supper, good old dog ?"&#xD;
Beppo didn't say whether ht would go or not; but wagged his great bushy tail, which spoke&#xD;
as plainly as language could have done, that he understood his kind mistress, and that her propo-&#xD;
sition met with his very decided approval. The tone of her voice was very pleasant to him, and&#xD;
he knew that he had done something. which sh approved; so he followed her into the kitchen,&#xD;
laid himself down by the ashes in the fire-place to dry hip hair, and waited patiently while his&#xD;
mistress drew out some live embers, and with the aid of some chips brought from the nearest ship-.&#xD;
yard, made a fire sufficient to boil some water in the little tin tea-kettle. After that was ari'anged,&#xD;
it was Beppo's turn to be served, and she gave him his allowance, which consisted of all the cold&#xD;
victuals abcut the premises.&#xD;
While-this little family-are engaged in disposing of their evening meal, we will give a sketch of&#xD;
their previous history. The mother of Clarence was a Creole of St. Domingo., Her parents were&#xD;
born in France, and had emigrated soon after their marriage to the West Indies, where Julie was&#xD;
born. She had reached her seventeenth year when the terrible negro revolution burst-forth, and&#xD;
she had seen her father murdered by his own slaves, With her mother she made her escape front&#xD;
the scene of danger, and found safety on board of an American brig which was lying in the harbor&#xD;
of Port au Prince, and about to sail for New York. In this vessel these two ladies came passen-&#xD;
gers to our city. On their arrival, they landed without .a friend or an acquaintance to greet&#xD;
them. They were completely destitute of means, and had nothing to aid in procuring their im-&#xD;
mediate wants, save a few articles of personal jewelry which they had about them at the time of&#xD;
the negro outbreak, and which they had saved from the wreck and ruin of everything at their&#xD;
home, when they'were so fortunate as to escape with their lives. The name of the father was Jules&#xD;
Clarin. - He' was a very extensive planter, owned a large sugar plantation, and a great many ne&#xD;
groes; He had ever been an overbearing and tyrannical master, and he was one of the first vie-&#xD;

&#xD;
time to his own slaves. His wife, M~adame Clarin, had been a kind and gentle mistress, and Julie&#xD;
her daughter was very much beloved; and it w'as this fact that made some of the slaves connive&#xD;
at their escape to the American vessel. At this period Jalie was about seventeen, as we have be-&#xD;
fore stated.  She was very pale, but very beautiful, with long dark hair, and very regular&#xD;
features. Her form, though small, was the perfection of symmetry and grace. She was no less&#xD;
accomplished than lovely.&#xD;
&#xD;
On their arrival in the city, the two interesting refugees found shelter in a boarding house in&#xD;
the western portion of the city, which we have been describing. For some months the sale of their&#xD;
watches and jewelry, combined with the strictest economy, enabled them to live; but when the&#xD;
Jewels were parted with one by one, they were left completely destitute. Providence never deserts&#xD;
those who place trust and confidence in him. He raises up friends for the poor and distressed&#xD;
when they have the most need, but the least reason to expect it. It was so in the case of our two&#xD;
forlorn ones. At the boarding house where they first found a home in this city, they met with a&#xD;
young journeyman'ship.-carpenter, whose name was Edward Bolton. He was the only one in the&#xD;
house who seemed to care for or take the least interest in the unprotected foreigners. Girdually&#xD;
this interest increased on his part, and they became intimate; and after a few months, he had sue-&#xD;
ceeded in ingratiating himself entirely into their confidende. Watching, as he did, their every&#xD;
movement, the fact of their embarrassed situation could notbe long concealed from his observation.&#xD;
He knew they were poor, and no sooner did he become fully aware that they were utterly destitute&#xD;
both of means as well as friends, than he sought to relieve them, in so delicate and generous a&#xD;
manner as would have done credit to the higher classes of society. . He went to work at once to&#xD;
remedy their troubles. He was a most skillful and active workman, was constantly employed.&#xD;
and not a soul in New York had any olaim upon his earnings.  He too was alone, and this fact&#xD;
bound him more strongly to his foreign acquaintances. He had saved from his earnings a few hun-&#xD;
dred dollars., He went to a very wealthy man, and rented a house of him at a moderate rate'&#xD;
After doing this, he furnished it with every article of furniture necessary to commence house-&#xD;
keeping; and then in the -most delicate manner spoke to Madame Clarin in regard to it. He&#xD;
told her that he was tired of life in a boarding house, and therefore had procured one for his own&#xD;
comfort; but that in order to have it complete, it would be necessary that he should have some one&#xD;
&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
to keep house for him and superintend his domestic arrangements. "Why will you net consent&#xD;
to do this, dear madam," he asked; "I am sure that you and Miss Julie would be much more&#xD;
comfortable thfn you possibly can be as you are now situated-then again it will cost you nothing,&#xD;
and me nothing either; for I shall not have to pay you anything for your trouble, while I should&#xD;
have to pay anybody else, as I have no near relationswin the city who would keep house for me. I&#xD;
should wish you and Julie to do just as if you were in your own house ; and, if it is not asking&#xD;
too much, I should wish you to regard me as a son, and Julie consider me in the light of a bro-&#xD;
ther."-&#xD;
Madame did not reply. She understood all that the generous hearted young carpenter wished,&#xD;
and fully appreciated his 'goodness and generosity, and so did Julie. They exhibited no false&#xD;
delicacy; but promptly accepted his proposition. A few weeks passed away, and-then they were&#xD;
all located in their new home, in the little two story house, and they were surrounded by all&#xD;
necessary household comforts. They had their-snug littleparlor which was in the front room, the&#xD;
windows of which opened upon the piazza. The back room was the place to take their meals.&#xD;
There was a clean kitchen; and up stairs was a large and pleasant room for the -mother and&#xD;
daughter;- and in the rear of that floor was another room, which was appropriated to Edward Boe-&#xD;
ton. How very kind he was! he worked early and late, and scarcely ever came home that he&#xD;
didn't fetch French books for them to read; and at last he hired a piano,. bought music, and what&#xD;
a pleasant. time they all had then! They hired no servants, and that gave Edward a thousand&#xD;
opportunities of obliging the lovely Julie, and of doing a hundred things to save the gentle'girl&#xD;
from fatigue. He brought the water from the pump for their daily use.; he made the fires, and&#xD;
when Sunday came, what a pleasant day it was for them! It was a day of rest, day of pleasure,&#xD;
and a day of worship.&#xD;
Early in the morning of that day the Widow Clarin and Julia, accompanied by Mr. Bolton,&#xD;
would go down town to the French&#xD;
Church, Du Saint Esprit, in&#xD;
Pine street, and listen to the&#xD;
service in that language from the&#xD;
lips of the worthy young pastor,&#xD;
the Reverend Mr. Verren. How&#xD;
well do we remember that old&#xD;
church which was located between&#xD;
Pine and Cedar. streets; we can&#xD;
see it now as we saw it in 1881i&#xD;
when they were digging up the&#xD;
bones and preparing to remove&#xD;
them and then tear down the ven-&#xD;
arable pile.&#xD;
When the morning service was&#xD;
L~J                      over they would return home, and&#xD;
the rest of the day was devoted to&#xD;
conversation and reading. Ed-&#xD;
F            ward found a ready teacher in Ju-&#xD;
lie, and she found him an apt&#xD;
scholar. It was not a long time&#xD;
before Edward could converse&#xD;
--    freely with the mother of his in-&#xD;
tended, who knew very little Eng-&#xD;
lish and was not disposed to learn&#xD;
any more than she did know.&#xD;
Is it strange that under all these circumstances, 4dward Bolton should have become devotedly&#xD;
attached to Julie Clarin? It wouldhave been more surprising if he had not. He loved the beautiful&#xD;
Creol4 from the first day that they had met, and after they had become inmates of the same house,&#xD;
he learned to make her the dearest object of his existence, but he did not tell her of his love. He&#xD;
Would not have done so for all the world. She knew it, and then the gratitude and real admiration&#xD;
of his sterling manly virtues-his goodness of heart-his nople bearing, had made her love him&#xD;
and she told her mother of it. The health of the old lady was very poor, and she hardly ever left&#xD;

her house save to go to the French church, and recently she rarely left her own room, but no soon-&#xD;
er had her daughter informed her of the state of her affections, and what she believed those of Ed-&#xD;
ward to be, than she sent for him, and as soon as they were alone (for Julie found it convenient&#xD;
about that time to attend to some trifling affair in the kitchen) she asked him if he loved Julia.&#xD;
Poor Edward was thunderstrucki Had she accused him of sacrilege he could not have felt so&#xD;
guilty. He was guilty. He did love Julie. No, he worshipped her as some superior being, but&#xD;
yet he did not wish to speak of it. Certainly not to her mother. She would probably be angry-&#xD;
Julie would be offended, and they might leave the house. ife made no feply, but Madame Clarin&#xD;
had read his countenance, ,and understood perfectly the cause of his embarrassment as well as if he&#xD;
had told her all, and she continued:&#xD;
"My- pauvre, she tell me she love you-I am very sick-I sal not live long time. It please me&#xD;
very much if you marry my joli Julie ; den when I die and go to my maria in de ciel above, you will&#xD;
take good care of your wife, and love my Julie I sal leave wid you."&#xD;
It was now that Edward Bolton found words to give vent to his long pent up love. He grasped&#xD;
the shrivelled hands of the old dame in his own immense palms-covered them with kisses-told&#xD;
her how long and how devotedly he had loved Julie; but the old lady did not appear to enter into&#xD;
the spirit of his feelings, and she very coolly replied:&#xD;
"Ah, mon ami Edoard, it is all very good for you young people to talk of the love, but not me.&#xD;
Allez chez*Julie, dit to her what you will say. She will tell you what I have said is true."&#xD;
Edward Bolton made but.a few steps until he reached the kitchen, where he found Julie, clasped&#xD;
her in his powerful arms and held her until the pleased girl told him with her own pleasant voice&#xD;
and sweet smile that it was true, and moreover that she was ready and willing to become-his wife&#xD;
whenever it pleased him to make her so. A few weeks after this conversation, the Reverend Mr.&#xD;
Verren, pastor of the French Episcopal " Eglise du St. Esprit," in Pine street, made them one,&#xD;
and the belle of the Island of St. Domingo was metamorphasised into the loving wife of Edward Bol-&#xD;
ton, a New York journeyman ship carpenter.&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
CONTENTS-Hapiness of Edward and Julie Bolton-Accidents follow-Sickiiess and imprisonment of Edward-his release&#xD;
-Ldward killed-Julie's relation to her son Clarence of the pat history of her family, in which are stated&#xD;
the infamous designs of Air. Wolf-the means he used to accomplish them-her indignation and repulsion of&#xD;
these attacks upon her honor-the efforts made.to overcome trouble, and finally the hiding of a friend.&#xD;
URING a period of several years following the&#xD;
marriage of Edward Bolton and Julie Clarin, we&#xD;
have little to relate  They continued to reside&#xD;
in the cottage, and for some time there occurred&#xD;
in the calm routine of their household little&#xD;
which would interest our readers. They were&#xD;
happy-very happy, though they were poor and&#xD;
had nothing but Edward's daily earnings at the&#xD;
ship yard, to depend upon for their support. But&#xD;
small as was this amount it was amply sufficient&#xD;
for all of their necessities. What was wealth to&#xD;
tliem at the very threshhold of their marriage&#xD;
career? They had a happy home, health and&#xD;
hope.  But- all these did not last" long.  A&#xD;
train of accidents arrived  First, Bolton met&#xD;
with an accident which confined him to the house&#xD;
for a month, and beforehe had got sufficiently&#xD;
well-to be enabled to go to his work again, the&#xD;
wife's mother died. Shortly after their rent be-&#xD;
came due, but owing to the heavy expenses of his own confinement, the funeral expenses of his&#xD;
mother, and his inability to save anything, he was'unable to pay his landlord. His household&#xD;
furniture was attached and he himself was arrested for debt and tagen to the old jail where&#xD;
debtors were confined at that day.&#xD;
It was not alone the amount of the debt which caused the hostility of the landlord. Mrs Belton&#xD;
was a most beautiful young woman, she had attracted his attention and he was determined to pos-&#xD;
sess her, even if he was obliged to blast the prospects of the husband, and to 41eprive him of his&#xD;
liberty to accomplish his designs. Mrs. Bolton visited her husband daily at that old jail.- How&#xD;
well do we remember it even now. It stood on the east side of the City Hall, where the Register's&#xD;
office now stands. It had 4 little cupola on the top of it. We often used to look at the poor pris-&#xD;
oners up there sunning themselves. Men confined as prisoners for no crime but for debt. We re-&#xD;
member as well how'they used to look, and how that old jail bell sounded as if it were merely yes-&#xD;
terday when we saw them and heard it.&#xD;
The detention of Edward Bolton in that old building was but for a few weeks, and then from an&#xD;
interference, which we shall have occasion to allude to hereafter, he was released and returned to&#xD;
the very house and home from which he had been taken by the landlord power of those times.&#xD;
Soon after his confinement Clarence was born, and they were restored to comfort once more. Work&#xD;
and prosperity followed the arrival of Clarence, and stayed about the old cottage for ten years,&#xD;
when an accident happened which destroyed both. Edward Bolton was'killed The first that his&#xD;
wife learned of the event was when the body of her husband was brought home by his fellow work.&#xD;
men a corpse. This event is too sad a one to dwell upon. It is enough to say that his death was&#xD;
caused by a sad accident in the ship yard of which he was forema'. He fell from off the scaffold-&#xD;
ing of a ship which was building, and the only words heard by those of his companions who first&#xD;
reached him were "wife! child !" and then he was dead. These was a large gathering at the&#xD;
cottage when his funeral took place, for he was known to many and all who knew him, loved and&#xD;
respected him. There was no useless pomp and heartless display on the occasion. He left a little&#xD;
property, but barely sufficie nt to give his widow and- her son a subsistence for a few years.-&#xD;
The widow had tasted poverty before, and the small amount left by her husband was treasured with&#xD;
the care of a miser. A fter her husband's death, Clarence continued but a year at the public school,&#xD;
and then he was transferred to the grammar school attached to Columbia College; when he was&#xD;
fully prepared to enter college she found many of the friends of her husband who were willing to&#xD;

&#xD;
aid her in placing Clarence in that college.  t the time our story opens Clarence was considered&#xD;
one of the best students in the class which was to graduate the coming fall.&#xD;
When the mother and son had finished their respective employments, they met in the little par-&#xD;
lor and partook of the scanty fare which the limited means of the mother enabled her to provide.&#xD;
The mother recommenced the conversation by referring to the ferry boat adventure.&#xD;
"And so my dear boy, you and Beppo have; by your joint efforts, saved a very pretty young&#xD;
girl from being drowned, even at the risk of being drowned yourself; and for all your trouble and&#xD;
the danger to which you exposed your own dear life, the father offered you a reward of fifty cents!.&#xD;
Well,-don't get angry about it, perhaps the father did not consider his daughter's life worth more&#xD;
than that small amount; if so, and she should live to reach womanhood, and have any gratitude&#xD;
herself, that father might be willing to dispose of her on very reasonable terms, even to a ship-&#xD;
carpenter's son. What do you think of that idea, Clarence?"&#xD;
"Oh, I don't think of that mother ; I was thinking of how ungentlemanly Mr.?Gould behaved to&#xD;
me. Who is he, mother? Did you'ever hear of him before ?"&#xD;
"Yes, and have met him in the company of another very rich man, whom I have cause to re-&#xD;
member; and I wish you to know and remember him also for the sake of your lamented father."&#xD;
"Who was the other rich man, mother, and what reason havs you for wishing that I should be&#xD;
acquainted with him ?"&#xD;
"His name, my son, is Peter Wolf. He was the man that caused your father to be placed in&#xD;
the jail."&#xD;
"In the jail? What! the prison in the Park? .My father ? . Mother, I am no longer a child&#xD;
though I am young. Hardships and the troubles we have had have given me the feelings and ex-&#xD;
perience of a man. I can now think and act for myself. There has always been some mystery&#xD;
connected with my early history, or rather of yours and father's, and I want to know all about it.&#xD;
This is not the first time I have heard you mention that man's name. I have almost unconsciously&#xD;
learned to hate the very sound of it; even- now it makes you look pale and shudder while we are&#xD;
talking of it. What did he do? Why did he cause father to be locked up in prison? What crime&#xD;
had he committed ?"&#xD;
"He? your father? crime! Bless your heart, child, he never committed a crime or did a wrong&#xD;
to a human being in his life. He was not confined for anything of that kind: he was arrested and&#xD;
placed in the old jail for debts which he owed, and was not able to pay. He was the kindest and&#xD;
best-"&#xD;
"But this Mr. Wolf, mother. What was the nature of the transactions between him and my&#xD;
father ? Did my father owe Wolf money ? I want to know all about it. What did Wolf do ?"&#xD;
"1Sit down, my 'hild, and don't get excited in that manner, and I will tell you what he did.&#xD;
When your father and myself were married, we occupied the same snug house that you and me&#xD;
now do, and it belonged then to Mr. Wolf, as well as the vacant land about it. He was in the habit&#xD;
of calling every quarter day to collect the rent and-"&#xD;
"Well he gotit, of course. Go on, mother."&#xD;
"Yes, at that time but, Clarence, mother 'was then what the world called pretty, and Mr.&#xD;
Wolf became a very great admirer of mine; and on one occasion, when he called to collect the rent,&#xD;
father was not at home, he was at his work in the ship yard, and-"&#xD;
"Mother! he did not dare to-"&#xD;
"Hush,,Clarence, don't get excited in that manner; why, how you frighten me! What is the&#xD;
matter? Mr. Wolf, my son, made a proposal to me: He offered to let me have the house rent free&#xD;
on certain conditions."&#xD;
"And did you, mother-?"&#xD;
"Me! It was sometime before I comprehended his real meaning, and then I drove him out of&#xD;
the house, and told him that if he dared to show his face inside of my honest husband's dwelling&#xD;
again, I, weak woman as I was, would beat out his brains,"&#xD;
"Good! glorious, rny dear mother !" shouted the excited boy, as he flung his arms about his&#xD;
mother's neck and fondly kissed her ; " what did this Wolf say to thht ?"&#xD;
"I did not give him time to say anything. I instantly made him take his departure, and when&#xD;
he got outside of the door, I fastened him out. I heard him muttering something about revenge&#xD;
when he was. etanding on the stoop; but I cared very little about what he said then. He has&#xD;
had his revenge since. I did not say anything to your father when he came home of what had&#xD;
&#xD;
In that pile, which was under the charge of one of the most infamous of men, your father was closely-&#xD;
confined. He was not even allowed 'to go on'what was called the 'limits,' which comprised the&#xD;
lower part ef the city. I used to go to that old jail regularly every day, sit by his side for hours&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.                                  21&#xD;
transpired, for he was a very violent man when he was roused to anger. He loved me tenderly,&#xD;
and I dreaded telling him of the insulting proposal I had received, lest he should do something to&#xD;
Mr. Wolf and get himself into trouble. He wQuld probably have told the other ship carpenters,&#xD;
and they would have hewed Mr. Wolf into mince meat with their broad axes.  Had they caught&#xD;
him in this neighborhood, they would have resented the insult offered to the wife' of one of their&#xD;
number, as if it had been to the wife of each individual; and as likely as not, Mr. Wolf would have&#xD;
been badly hurt."&#xD;
"It would have served him perfectly right, dear mother, and so every other rich villain ought&#xD;
to be served, who uses his wealth to corrupt and seduce the poor man's wife or daughter. Pro-&#xD;
ceed now, mother, and tell me all that happened afterwards. You don't know how much I shall&#xD;
love you after this !"&#xD;
" A few days after Mr. Wolf's visit, Edward out his knee very badly with an adze, and this&#xD;
accident confined him to the house for several weeks, during which period he was unable to do any&#xD;
work at the yard. He had never saved up his earnings; he spent all his money as fast as he made&#xD;
it, to surround me and my mother with every comfort which he thought we might need, and when&#xD;
this accident occurred, we very soon began to be very much cramped for money to procure even&#xD;
common necessaries, for your father.was very proud, and scorned to ask assistance from any one.&#xD;
Before he was able to leave the house, my mother, whose health had been bad for a long time,&#xD;
began to grow worse, and then she died. Her funeral expenses obliged us to get into debt very&#xD;
considerably. Finally we could not pay the quarter's rent when it became due; and without any&#xD;
explanation, and before my husband was well enough to go to work, Mr. Wolf's agent, acting un-&#xD;
der his orders, seized and sold every particle of our furniture, and our home was stripped of every-&#xD;
thing. But that was not all. Your father had some time previous endorsed a note for a friend&#xD;
to the amount of one hundred and fifty dollars. This the friend was unable to pay when it be-&#xD;
came due. Mr. Wolf purchased it, sued, got judgment against-the endorser, for your father knew&#xD;
nothing a ioat law, and somehow.or.other before we ever dreamed of anything of the kind, an officer&#xD;
came and my husband was taken off like a thief, and locked up in the debtor's prison in the Park.&#xD;
The old jail they called it.&#xD;

and try to cheer him, forbeing in such a place caused him to be very down hearted. 'All of our old&#xD;
neighbors were very kind; they would fill my basket every morning with nice things, pies, cakes,&#xD;
and fresh butter. It almost broke my heart to see him in that filthy place, On one occasion he&#xD;
said to me, 'Julie, I have got a plan in my head by which I think I can persuade Ir. Wolf to let&#xD;
me out of this.' 'What is it, love?' I asked, in surprise, and he continued: 'There can be no&#xD;
possible good in my staying locked up here. If I'was allowed to leave, I could go to work, and&#xD;
with a little economy I could earn, and we could soon save a sufficient amount to pay off the petty&#xD;
amount for which I am locked up. Now, when you go away from me to-day, suppose you go up&#xD;
to my employer's ship-yard, and get him to write a letter to Mr. Wolf. He can say in it that he&#xD;
will employ me again at two dollars a day, and that out of that sum he will retain one half, and&#xD;
pay is over to Mr. Wolf, until all I owe that man is paid off. He will do it, I know he will, and&#xD;
when you come to visit me to-morrow, you can bring the letter with you. Mr. Wolf is not a fool,&#xD;
and he will see at once how much better such a course would be for him, than let me lie and rot&#xD;
here.' I need not tell you, my son, how willingly I complied with your father's wish. It seemed&#xD;
to me so reasonable a proposal, that I had no doubt that it would prove successful, and that your&#xD;
father would soon have his liberty. I went up to the ship-yard, and I had no sooner told the pro-&#xD;
prietor what I desired, than he asked me to take a seat for a moment, and at once wrote the letter&#xD;
and handed it to me, with some kind words which cheered he -up, and the next day at a very&#xD;
early hour I was at the jail, and gave it to your father. When he had read it carefully, ho seemed&#xD;
very much pleased, and turning to me, he said: 'Now, Julie, this is all we want. Do you take it,&#xD;
and go at once to the residence of Mr. Wolf, and for fear of accident, don't deliver it to anybody&#xD;
else but Mr. Wolf himself.  Add your entreaties to the letter, and he will arrange for my re-&#xD;
lease.'"&#xD;
"Did you go, my mother ?"&#xD;
"What could I do but go, Clarence. I couldn't bear the idea of then informing your father&#xD;
what an infamous man Mr. Wolf was. Mother could not tell him that all our troubles-and' at&#xD;
least, that his imprisonment was owing to my scornful rejection of his base overtures-and to the&#xD;
beauty which I then possessed and which he loved so much. The thought would have driven him&#xD;
mad. No! and so I went up to Mr. Wolf's house, trusting that heaven would guard and protect&#xD;
Ame while engaged in so holy a work, as endeavoring to procure a husband's liberty, and his retutn&#xD;
to his own house. I found Mr. Wolf at home. He lived in a magnificent dwelling in Broadway.&#xD;
I was shown up to his splendid library, as it was called, and there I found him, and without say-&#xD;
ing a, word I handed him&#xD;
Lfthe letter. He did not even&#xD;
appear to recognize me, at&#xD;
least he did not say a word&#xD;
or even ask me to a seat.-&#xD;
He opened and. read the let-&#xD;
ter very carefully,and with-&#xD;
out-taking his eyes from off&#xD;
the paper. At last he smil-&#xD;
ed, and turning his face to-&#xD;
wards me, he said, 'Ah,&#xD;
-  _  _   _Mrs. Bolton, 'I see that I&#xD;
-  ----/-    /have acted rather too se-&#xD;
verely, but I will soon rem-&#xD;
edy that. By your-coming&#xD;
- __to see me, I find that you&#xD;

language on a certain oca-&#xD;
sion provoked me to resort&#xD;
~, to more stringent measures&#xD;
-    than I usually resort to&#xD;
with my non paying tenants, Now I will alter my determination. You have given me a great&#xD;
deal of .trouble, but now that you have made the first advances, I will meet you half way. I&#xD;

will release your husband-not only that, -I will give you a better house to reside in-nearer&#xD;
my own, rent free, and I will farnish it handsomely from top tolasement.'&#xD;
"I was about to bless and thank him for so much goodness, when he interrupted me by saying,&#xD;
'Wait a moment, I have not yet named the conditions,' and he added, 'I will do this, and perhaps&#xD;
more, but if I do, I will reserve to myself the pleasure of calling and seeing you at your residence,&#xD;
whenever I please, or if it pleases you better-whenever your husband is absent at his work.'-&#xD;
Then I understood him fully, and I spurned him and his base proposal at once. I told him that&#xD;
rather than consent to his infamous wishes, I would starve in the jail with my beloved husband,&#xD;
and then when I saw his calm cold grey eyes fixed upon me, I thought of my poor husband in pris-&#xD;
on, and of you too, my child-for it was only a few days previous to your birth-I sank upon my&#xD;
knees, kissed his hands, and begged and prayed that if he had one human feeling left, that he&#xD;
would pity and give a husband liberty to go home to his wife, and be with her when our first infant&#xD;
should be born."&#xD;
"And what did Mr. Wolf say in reply to that, mother ?"&#xD;
"lie coldly said, 'rise, young woman, you have my -conditions, accept or reject them as you&#xD;
please '-and then I rose and cursed him to his face. I applied every epithet to him disgraceful&#xD;
to a man's name and nature, and then returned to your father in the jail and'told him all. Judge,&#xD;
my son, of my delight when he pressed me in his arms, and said, 'no matter now, love, I am free.'&#xD;
I then noticed that another person was with him, whom I had not before observed. He came for-&#xD;
ward, shook'me cordially by the hand, and your father introduced me to Colonel Vanderhoost.-&#xD;
That evening we were all in this cottage together.&#xD;

CHAPTER Ve&#xD;
CONTENTs-Nia Bolton's relation to Clarence of past events continued-Indignation of Clarence and his determination&#xD;
of avenging injuries received-his anticipation of bright hopes for the future-his course in Columbia Col.&#xD;
lege-his vindication of his rights by personal chastisement to some of the purse-proud students-the res-&#xD;
ident overlooks his conduct and lie becomes a general favorite.&#xD;
VERYTHING about us became pleasant, and for&#xD;
~              a long time after the release of your father we&#xD;
were happy. Only a few days passed and you&#xD;
were born, and then we felt we had a more pow-&#xD;
erful incentive to exertion Colonel Vander-&#xD;
hoost became a steady friend to us, and was of&#xD;
great service to your father."&#xD;
"Mother, tell me all about Colonel Vander.&#xD;
hoost-who he was, or what was he ?"&#xD;
Il         ,"He was a gentleman,. though nominally a&#xD;
merchant. His father was an old resident,' and&#xD;
also a shipping merchant. He had known your&#xD;
father some years previous to the, jail business,&#xD;
but in the interval had been traveling on the&#xD;
continent of Europe. Only a few days after his&#xD;
return he had learned of your father's imprison-&#xD;
ment, and the circumstancep connected with it,&#xD;
when he immediately went to work and obtained'&#xD;
his release by paying my husband's debts. That&#xD;
was not all, he had made arrangements for our&#xD;
continuance in the cottage, from which I had never been forced to leave although it hardly&#xD;
contained anything else but bare walls. Colonel Vanderhoost purchased several hundred dollars&#xD;
worth of furniture and gave it to us. He knew I loved the old place, for the reason that it had&#xD;
been my first home after I married your father, who 'wished me to leave the-spot and no longer re-&#xD;
side in a house owned by so base a proprietor. Colonel Vanderhoost went and hired the house in,&#xD;
his own name of Mr. Wolf, and paid him his rent when due. We had no more to do with Mr.&#xD;
Wolf."&#xD;
"But, mother, what became of Colonel Vanderhoost-is he dead ?"&#xD;
"No, my child, his father failed and. died about the time you was born, and his property was&#xD;
divided between his two children. The Colonel, I believe, spent the most of his, and his sister bet,&#xD;
came the wife of Mr. Robert Gould, consequently he is the uncle of the lady whose life you have&#xD;
saved, and I have no doubt he will be much pleased when he hears of the circumstance."&#xD;
"Indeed, dear mother, I am delighted to hear this' but go on and tell me all aboit him.&#xD;
" Well when the Colonel became reduced, your father, as soon as he heard of it, went and paid&#xD;
him all that he owed him, and then I heard very little about him, as his position in society was&#xD;
very different from ours, and we rarely met, and finally, I suppose, he has forgotten us, as he has&#xD;
never called. I know he is still in the city. He is a noble and kind hearted gentleman, but some-&#xD;
that singular and eccentric."&#xD;
"Did you ever see Mr. Wolf afterward, mother ?"&#xD;
"No, my child; I never have met, him  since the interview in the library at his house, but I&#xD;
have frequently heard of him. He sold this house a few months after Colonel Vanderhoost rented&#xD;
it, and after its sale we paid our rent to the present owner. Mr. Wolf is a very wealthy man, and,&#xD;
is surrounded by a numerous family, and his riches are increasing. The good book says that "the&#xD;
ungodly shall flourish like a green bay tree," and therefore Mr. Wolf continues to prosper in this'&#xD;
life."&#xD;
"Mother, you said you wished me to remember Mr. Wolf, when we commenced the conversation&#xD;
ihis evening. You may rest assured I shall do so. I will never forget or forgive him. You have&#xD;
told me enough to show that I have cause to remember him until my dying day. Do you know&#xD;
what I will do, if God spares my life ?" .  s-&#xD;
"No, child ; how should I know what you will do, or what reason there is for you doing any-&#xD;
tig. It's all over now--passed and forgotten. Mr. Wolf is not probably aware that we are in&#xD;
xsence-"&#xD;
&#xD;
TA&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
25,&#xD;
&#xD;
" He will find it out though, before I have done with him. He owes me a debt for all the trouble&#xD;
and anxiety he caused you and my father. God says the sins of the fathers shall be visited upon&#xD;
the children. I will make them feel me before I forgive what has passed. We have suffered,'and&#xD;
they shall suffer. Think, dear mother, that you should have knelt to such a man as you have&#xD;
described, and spurned too! I'll avenge it some day."&#xD;
"You, my son; nonsense! what can you do ?"&#xD;
"He shall kneel to me before he dies; if not him, his children shall! Mother do you remember&#xD;
that poetry which says&#xD;
'For time at last sets all things even,&#xD;
And if we do but watch the hour,&#xD;
There never yet was human power,&#xD;
Which could evade, if unforgiven,&#xD;
The patient.search and vigil long&#xD;
Of him who treasures up a wrong &#xD;
Now, you will see how true it will prove in this case. I would like to see that Wolf and his young&#xD;
Wolves beggars; but they shall not be confined in the debtor's jail. No, mother, I will be one to&#xD;
qid in erasing that disgraceful law from out of oiur statute book."&#xD;
"(You, Clarence! why, are you going crazy ?"&#xD;
" No; but I have thought about the matter before to-night, and now my mind is made up, Time&#xD;
will show that I can do something. As for that Colonel Vanderhoost, I will seek him out and get&#xD;
acquainted with him. If he is poor, I will give him-"&#xD;
" My dear Clarence, you are getting out of your head! What are you talking about ? We have&#xD;
hardly means'sufficient to keep us from want until you graduate, and only 'so by 4he hardest&#xD;
economy."&#xD;
" That don't make any difference, mother. Then I shall be free, and can work in earnest. I'll&#xD;
make money and acquire power, and then I shall be able to pay off to my heart's content all out-&#xD;
standing debts, even those of gratitude as well as of hate. Now, give me one kiss, motherK, and&#xD;
I will go to my room and prepare myself for recitations to-morrow morning."&#xD;
The mother-kissed her son, bade him good night, and then she sat alone by the fireside and in-&#xD;
dulged in many pleasing as well as painful memories of her previous life, that had long lain asleep&#xD;
in her bosom; then came to cheer her bright, beautiful hopes and visions of happiness for her&#xD;
darling boy, and the comfort and satisfaction which he would call around her declining years;&#xD;
and before she laid down to sleep, she knelt by her bedside and poured forth to the friend of the&#xD;
widow and the orphan her thanks for past blessings, and made humble and fer-vent supplications&#xD;
that He would guide, direct and control, the wild and wayward spirit of her loved child-that he&#xD;
might become in the future a useful member of the human family, and ever prove worthy of the&#xD;
choicest benefits and blessings; and when she had finished her nightly offering, she lay down'to&#xD;
sleep, and dreamed of the husband that had gone before her to another world, leaving her, and his&#xD;
offspring and image, to struggle on unaided in this.&#xD;
The next morning Clarence was up at daybreak, and at the usual hour, in his usual cheerful&#xD;
spirits, took his way down town to the time honored old building where he was receiving his educa-&#xD;
tion. Columbia College appeared at that day different from what it now does. The value of&#xD;
property had not then offered such inducements as it has since done, to surround it and hedge it in&#xD;
with stores, houses and hotels,&#xD;
We hate in a previous chapter merely alluded to the fact that Clarence was a student at Colum-&#xD;
bia College, but there are pome circumstances connected with his entering that old building as a&#xD;
student that are so creditable to a certain class of this community, that we will mention them.&#xD;
In the Ward, where the widow and her son resided, their history, or rather, the history of&#xD;
Edward Bolton and his wife was as well known as their faces. All'his associates and the ship me-&#xD;
chanics in that part of the town were conversant with the details.. They respected and liked him;&#xD;
his sudden death caused them heartfelt sorrow, and they sympathized deeply witj his little&#xD;
family. There was a warm interest excited in their hearts for the two survivors, and more par-&#xD;
ticularly towards the son, and " Ned Bolton's son," as they designated him, had. as many sincere~&#xD;
friends in the class he was born and brought up amongst, as ever his father had. By the assis-&#xD;
tance of these worthy men and their families, the limited resources of Mrs. Bolton and her son were&#xD;
made to last a long time. They aided them in a hundred delicate modes, and when Clarence&#xD;
arrived at the age when he could enter College, many of them got together and subscribed a certain&#xD;
amount towards paying the expenses of Clarence while in College, This amounted to several hun.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7713-00000014"/>&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
dred dollars. The subscribers would have given it to'her for the use of the boy, out and out, but&#xD;
the widow had an independent spirit, and she would not listen to so generous a proposition, and&#xD;
Ireftised to receive or use the sum unless they would give it to her as a loan, to be repaid with in.-&#xD;
terest at some future day. The parties consented that it should be so understood, and then the.&#xD;
widow received the money; but used it as sparingly and carefully as if she expected every day to&#xD;
be called upon to return it.&#xD;
&#xD;
With the boys of his own age--his companions and playmates in the Ward where he resided-&#xD;
young Bolton was a general favorite both before and after entering College. He was a leader in&#xD;
all their amusements, and frequently li their boyish battles. When he was placed in College, it&#xD;
took some time before he became at home or made much headway in getting into the good graces&#xD;
of the other students, his new associated. Many of the young hopefuls, who had rich parents or&#xD;
strong connexions, took it into their heads that he was a mere nobody, and fastened upon him as&#xD;
a most fit and.proper subject to become their butt and sport, and they were not long in -commen-&#xD;
cing operations upon him. Clarence bore with all their insults and petty annoyances for some&#xD;
time, and regarded one of their epithets 6f "the mechanic's boy" as rather complimentary than&#xD;
otherwise, and did not reply or take any notice of their ill manners. At last his patience became&#xD;
exhausted; he could stand it no longer, and determined to put an end at once to the business, as&#xD;
he found the more he submitted the more he was obliged to bear. Accordingly, the very first&#xD;
opportunity that offered, after he had made up his mind to settle the matter by defining his true&#xD;
position, he Availed himself' of it. The whole class were out on the green in front of the College&#xD;
during recess, amusing themselves in various ways. Clarence requested some of them to hear a&#xD;
few words he had to say. They complied with his request, thinking that he was going to afford&#xD;
them some additional sport. , He did; but very different sport from what they expected. He made&#xD;
his speech, and as it was his first public address we give it entire:&#xD;
" My fine fellows, I want to have a general understanding with you, as some particular indivi-&#xD;
duals, that I shall name, - don't seent to be very well acquainted with me. Now, this state of&#xD;
things shall not last any longer if I can help it, and I rather reckon I can. I have been most&#xD;
grossly insulted, and I will put up with it no longer. I should be ashamed of myself were I to&#xD;
do so. Now, I want some of the largest boys in the class to just step out. You, Ned Rutgers,&#xD;
Charley Mason and Fred. Jbnes, you have each ofyou ridiculed and made fun of me, and had it all&#xD;
your own way. Now I intend to enjoy a little fun myself. You are a great deal bigger&#xD;
than I am, and yet I am going to give each of you a sound thrashing, or get one myself. You are&#xD;
a low bred set of puppies, bullies, and I honestly believe cowards; and if you are not, now is tho&#xD;
&#xD;
3F&#xD;
&#xD;
time to prove it. After I have finished you, if there is any other young gentleman who wants to&#xD;
take a round with me, I am his man and will accommodate him."&#xD;
No sooner did Clarence finish this pithy address, which rather astonished some of the bloods,&#xD;
than le was cheered by a dozen at least of the younger students, who had been tyrannized over&#xD;
by the three larger students whom Clarence had designated by name. They on their parts were&#xD;
taken aback, and for a few moments did not open their lips; at last the largest of the three, Charles&#xD;
Mason, advanced towards Clarence, and holding his fist near the face of his daring challenger,&#xD;
observed, "Why ypu unlicked cub, what are you'talking about ? Pll-" Mr. Mason did not'&#xD;
have time to say what he would do, for before he had finished his sentence a well directed&#xD;
blow from Clarence's mus-&#xD;
cular arm laid him out, he&#xD;
recovered his feet very ra-&#xD;
pidly, but only to befetch-&#xD;
ed again, and again. When&#xD;
the other two boys saw    LZM&#xD;
how their companion was&#xD;
treated they interfered,&#xD;
but Clarence's blood was&#xD;
now up, and before five&#xD;
minutes had passed the -&#xD;
trio had received as sound&#xD;
and wholesome a thrash-&#xD;
ing from Clarence's cast&#xD;
iron fists as they needed&#xD;
and were perfectly satis-&#xD;
fied. The other boys cheer-&#xD;
ed, but Clarence did not&#xD;
wait to receive their con-&#xD;
gratulations. No sooner&#xD;
had victory declared in his                                 ~&#xD;
favor, than he left the&#xD;
groupe, went directly to the president of the College, told him what had occurred, and asked him&#xD;
if he should resign and quit college, or what punishment he would inflict upon him. The Presi-&#xD;
dent was much pleased at the bold, off-hand manner in which Clarence had acted, and he direct-&#xD;
ed him to go to his studies, and then made enquiry into the facts from other students. They con-&#xD;
firmed all that Clarence had stated, and he concluded that he would overlook the matter. Clar-&#xD;
ence became a lion, and was never afterward insulted, and never had another fight while in Col.&#xD;
lege. Even the large students discovered that he carried to many guns for any one of them singly,&#xD;
and were very glad to let him alone. As for Clarence he loved excitement, and if a part of his&#xD;
collegiate career had consisted in partaking of a regular built fight on the College green every day&#xD;
of his life, (except Sundays,) nothing would have suited him better-he would have been perfectly&#xD;
delighted, not that he wasof a quarrelsome disposition; on the contrary, he had a most .amiable&#xD;
temper and a kind heart, but he regarded the exercise as exceedingly healthy, and well calculated&#xD;
to develope his physical ability and relieve the effects of a too close attention to his studies. His&#xD;
preparatory for 'such an amusement had been finished in his earlier career, and the well fed&#xD;
sons of wealthy merchants and aristocratic fatnilies would have stood a small chance of coming off&#xD;
conquerors in a fight with a rough and tumble "go in and win" ship carpenter's son. Clarence&#xD;
was a good student, in fact' he had thus fa;r proved himself the best student in the College. He&#xD;
- had taken the lead from the commencement of his college career--had won!the gold medal, and was&#xD;
at the head of his class at the close of every college year up to the time when he is introduced&#xD;
into our story. In a few weeks he was to graduate. -He had become a general favorite with the&#xD;
professors and tutors, who saw in him every evidence of genius and ability. He had been enabled&#xD;
during the last year to earn some money by devoting a portion of his time each day to giving pri-&#xD;
vate lessons to other students, who had fears of 'not being able to pass creditably their examina-&#xD;
tions, unless they received assistance in their studies outside of the College walls. Clarence had&#xD;
also written many articles for the local newspaper press, and though he had not as yet written for&#xD;
pay, his articles always were published accompanied by flatter-ing notices from the editor.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
CONTENXs-Fanny Gould the daughter of the rich broker-Clarence meets her for the first time since the accident on the&#xD;
ferry boat-their conversation-Clarence introduced to Colonel Vanderhoost-his endeavors to show grati-&#xD;
tude for past services-the dog Beppo-Col. Vanderhoost pleased with Clarence and determines to give him&#xD;
his assistance.&#xD;
ANNY GOULD, the daughter of the rich broker,&#xD;
has not been lost sight of, although we have had&#xD;
to leave her for a time, in order to say a few&#xD;
words in reference to some of the other principal&#xD;
characters of our story. On her return home,&#xD;
after the ferry boat adventure, she was very&#xD;
closely questioned by her parents in reference to&#xD;
what had passed between her and Clarence, but.&#xD;
she had very little to say, and was distressed at&#xD;
the manner in which the young lad who had&#xD;
saved her from drowning had been treated by&#xD;
her parents, particularly by her father. He&#xD;
wished to forget the whole affair. The result&#xD;
was less disagreeable to him than if his daugh-&#xD;
ter had been drowned. Then there would have&#xD;
been a coroner's verdict, and his name would&#xD;
have got in the newspapers in connection with&#xD;
an unpleasant transaction. As things had turned&#xD;
up, his daughter had been saved by some un-&#xD;
knowr. person, who probably would never be&#xD;
heard of again. Several days passed, and the subject was not alluded to in that family circle.&#xD;
Clarence meanwhile was 'closely pursuing his studies, and heard no more of Fanny or her pa-&#xD;
rents, and made his daily visits to the College as if nothing had transpired.  He did not even&#xD;
mention the circumstance to any of his friends. He was returning from the college about a week&#xD;
after the rescue, and had just turned the corner of Park Place and Broadway when he met two&#xD;
young school girls. The thought had barely crossed his brain that he had seen them somewhere&#xD;
before, when one of them stopped and accosted him with the simple question "Ain't you Clarence?"&#xD;
Then he knew her at once, and as he took her hand he replied, "Indeed I am, and you are&#xD;
Fanny, with whom I had such a pleasant time in the North River last week. I am right glad to&#xD;
see you, and I hope the immersion has not caused you to be ill."&#xD;
"1Oh, no, indeed," she replied, "I am as well as I ever was, and right glad to see you, Do you&#xD;
know I thought I should never see you again? Don't you remember my sister Lydia? This is&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"I had not forgotten either yourself or her; but I was much surprised to meet you, in fact I&#xD;
did not know you at first. I remember very well seeing your sister on the ferry boat before you&#xD;
got overboard. Which way are you walking ?"&#xD;
"!We have just returned from school, gnd are going directly home. Which way are you going ?"&#xD;
"I am going home, too, and I have also just left school."&#xD;
"1Why do you go to school ?""&#xD;
"1Something like it. I am a student at Columhia College, and sh'll be for afew weeks longer,&#xD;
and then I shall graduate."&#xD;
"I am very glad to hear it. How much you must know; but we girls don't have such a quan-&#xD;
tity of books, and such puzzling stuff to study as you do. Were you angry with my father? I&#xD;
am sure you were."&#xD;
Clarence gazed steadily at the little maid for a moment ere a isai le ally reply to her last obser-&#xD;
vation, and then he quietly observed, ' Men, like your father, Miss .anny, entertain some strange&#xD;
ideas of their fellow plan. I was not angry with him, although I felt hurt at his rudeness, when I&#xD;
had done nothing but render him most essential service, as I supposed. I excused him, thinking -&#xD;
that perhaps he was not desirous of having his daughter become aceuainted with a young person&#xD;
of whom he knew nothing. Your bright smile at meeting me to-day was quite sufficient to do&#xD;
sway with ill resentment towards him "&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.&#xD;
Oh, I am so glad of that. Yod will be acquainted with me, will you not? I mean, you will&#xD;
come and see us at home, and get acquainted with my mother ?"&#xD;
"Really, Miss Fanny, you are very kind, but I don't see very well how I can comply with your&#xD;
invitation. Your father has not yet invited me to his house, and after what has occurred I can-&#xD;
not very well call there consistently with my own ideas of self.respect."&#xD;
" How sorry I am; but then wont I see you every day? I go to school every day in the week,&#xD;
except Saturday, and we shall assuredly meet in the street, and then you can take a long walk&#xD;
.with me and sister Lydia."&#xD;
"I suppose we shall meet occasionally, and whenever I do meet you and your sister, I shall&#xD;
stop and speak to you. You, at least, will not think me impudent ?"&#xD;
"Impudent ? Certainly not. I cannot forget that you saved my life, when nobody else seemed&#xD;
to care about me. I Want you to speak to me. I like you better than anybody else that I ever&#xD;
saw, besides, what a horrid ungratefulgirl I should be if I did not like you; but here comes ny&#xD;
uncle, Colonel Vanderhoost."&#xD;
"Colonel Vanderhoost !" exclaimed Clarence, and memory instantly recalled the story of his&#xD;
mother; whichh is him ?"&#xD;
"That gentleman coming&#xD;
towards us with the little&#xD;
cane in his hand. He almost&#xD;
always ineets and goes home&#xD;
with us.  He is mother's&#xD;
brother and our beaux."&#xD;
The Colonel joined them,&#xD;
and Fanny introduced Clar-&#xD;
ence to him.&#xD;
"Now, dear uncle, you&#xD;
must like Mr.' Bolton; he&#xD;
saved my life when I fell&#xD;
overboard, which I told you,.&#xD;
all about," said little'Fan-&#xD;
ny, and added, "You know&#xD;
how my father has treated&#xD;
-him."&#xD;
"My dear, brave young.&#xD;
ster," exclaimed the Colonel,&#xD;
"I am perfectly delighted&#xD;
to meet with you; in fact, I&#xD;
have been looking for you&#xD;
ever since I heard of your gallant adventure, I am prepared to like you, if for no other reason&#xD;
than that my brother-in-law and the father of these darling little girls Jas behaved very shabby&#xD;
towards you. Never mind him. Ile is only a cop."&#xD;
"Colonel," replied Clarence, "'1 am very much obliged to you for your kliidness. Myname is&#xD;
Bolton. Do you not recollect the name ?"&#xD;
"Bolton? to be sure I do! but-let me take another look at you, young man. Is itpossible that&#xD;
you are the son of an old friend of mine-a most deserving man of that name ?"&#xD;
S"I am his son, and I have been very anxious for some days past to see and converse with you.&#xD;
It is only recently that I have learned front my mother's lips how deep are the obligations I owe&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
" Oh, never mind that. Is your mother still alive ? I have had such trouble of late years my-&#xD;
self that I hardly had time to look after anything else than my own immediate business, I must&#xD;
know all about you before we part." - .&#xD;
" When we have seen these young ladies home, I should like very mich to have-a few mo-&#xD;
ments conversation with you, if you have no objections ?"&#xD;
" None in the world. On the contrary, as I said before, I am delighted to meet you. By the&#xD;
way, when we reach the end of Broadway, as these young ladies live in the Bowling Green Row,&#xD;
you had better let me see them to their own door, and you can amuse yourself onwthe Battery uin-&#xD;
til I join you. .You understand the reason."&#xD;

"Certainly," replied Clarence.&#xD;
Fanny was surprised at all this, and as Clarence was about leaving them, she said, "Why, you&#xD;
two"gentlemen seem to be very well acquainted, and to know all about each other and want to get&#xD;
rid of Sis. and me as speedily as possible. Well, never mind, Lam very glad you are acquainted."&#xD;
Clarence bade the party "good afternoon," and was about leaving, when Fanny remarked:&#xD;
"Remember, Mr. Clarence, we leave our home in the Row every morning at half-past eight, to&#xD;
go to school, and return at three. Don't fail to meet us as soon as you can. Good-bye."&#xD;
"I'll remember. Now, good-bye to both yourself and little sister."&#xD;
"You are a nice little puss for your age, Fan.," said Col. V., after Clarence was out of hearing.&#xD;
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Only thirteen years old, and-"&#xD;
"And what, uncle ?"&#xD;
Why, making an, appointment with that young fellow !"&#xD;
"I ?-it's no such thing. Papa won't let him come to our house, and I was only telling him&#xD;
when he could see me in the street, if he cares about seeing me."&#xD;
"You are a grateful and good little girl, Fan., and I will assist you. Before a month has pass-&#xD;
ed, your amiable father shall invite him to the house, or my name is not William Vanderhoost.&#xD;
He is a fine noble fellow. Sis., you are a great pet of mine, and I am very fond of you. That&#xD;
young Bolton is the son of an old friend; his father is dead, and I am bound in honor to see what&#xD;
I can make of him. He has commenced his acquaintance by saving your life, and-"&#xD;
"What, dear uncle, go on, and what ?'&#xD;
"And you are at home. Now run into thehouse, little girls, and when you see your Ma, tell&#xD;
her that Colonel Vanderhoost, her brother, called.- Bye bye."1&#xD;
The sisters replied with "good-bye, dear uncle," and entered their father's-mansion. The&#xD;
Colonel passed out of the little iron gate of the grass plot in front of those Bowling Green resi-&#xD;
dences, and followed Clarence Bolton to the Battery. After walking a short'distance, he discovered&#xD;
the young student seated upon one of the benches, and immediately went to him. As the Colonel&#xD;
approached, Clarence rose, and with considerable emotion, began the conversation, very much to&#xD;
the surprise of the Colonel, in this fashion:&#xD;
"1Colonel Vanderhoost! there is no man living whom I have so much desired to see as yourself&#xD;
for several days. It was only a few days ago that my mother, when narrating to me some im-&#xD;
portant events in her history, made me aware of the debt of gratitude I owe you. I.will never&#xD;
forget. it while I live."&#xD;
" Bless your heart, my dear boy, you are making a mountain out of a molehill. I only did what&#xD;
every man placed aal was should have done. Your father was a noble-hearted man. I never&#xD;
have found a great many like him, and your mother too was a most estimable person. How is&#xD;
her health ?"&#xD;
"She does not enjoy good health; but is generally very comfortable. We live very retired.&#xD;
She told me, sir, all the details of the conduct of a Mr. Wolf."&#xD;
" Of old Wolf, did she? Well he is a bird! Lucky devil, although he is a precious old rascal-&#xD;
at heart. But never mind him, he is only a cop."&#xD;
"My mother informed me how kind and how generously you behaved in rescuing my 'father&#xD;
from that Wolf'sfangs."&#xD;
"Wolf'sfangs? Come, now, that ain't bad for a new beginner! I must tell that at the Club.&#xD;
Never mind what I did then, my boy. I was abundantly able to do it, and if it was a good action,&#xD;
so much the better for me : It-may serve to balance some of my foolish ones in days that are gone&#xD;
by. Let me take another look at.you. There is no mistake about it, you are Edward Bolton's&#xD;
living image. Genteel, black eyes and hair, white teeth, slim pale face-Clarence, you will do!&#xD;
[, Colonel Vanderhoost, say so. I'll make something out of you-time-time. How old are you ?"&#xD;
"About seventeen."&#xD;
" Seventeen now, and that will make you twenty one when you are four years older, according&#xD;
to Dabol1. What else have you got to say for yourself?"&#xD;
" Nothing, my dear sir, save to again reiterate my expressions of gratitude for what passed&#xD;
before I was born."&#xD;
"Not a word about that. Let-it all pass. Never look backward. Take care of the future."&#xD;
" I do Colonel, and it is to the future that I look for the means of showing you how I regard&#xD;
you."&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON. 31&#xD;
"That you can easily do. I already feel interested in you. I did so when I heard of your ad-&#xD;
venture, for until to-day I was not aware who you really were. Now I feel an additional interest&#xD;
to what I felt before. How are you and your mother off for the mopusses?"&#xD;
" For what ?"&#xD;
" Money."&#xD;
" We are comfortable. That is, we don't want for anything."&#xD;
" I am glad to hear that, for when you do, you may rely on me. Now tell me something more&#xD;
about yourself."&#xD;
By a series of-well directed questions, which were promptly and faithfully replied to by Clar-&#xD;
ence, the Colonel obtained from that young gentleman every event of importance that had occur-&#xD;
red to him or his mother since the decease of his father. When he had finished, by saying that in&#xD;
a few days he should graduate from the College, the Colonel asked this question-&#xD;
" Well, and when you are fledged, what is to be your first fly ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't know yet," replied Clarence. "Our funds will be about used up then, and I shall have&#xD;
to do something by which I can gt a livelihood for myself and support my mother."&#xD;
"That's it; you must do something to earn money. That is the necessary earthly god of us poor&#xD;
devils on earth. What have you got to do to-morrow evening ?"&#xD;
'Nothing very particular, except to study niy lessons."&#xD;
"That's all right. Do you know where Delmonico lives'?"&#xD;
"I do not."&#xD;
"It is in William street, near Beaver. Meet me there to-morrow afternoon to dine with me at&#xD;
five o'clock precisely. After dinner we will talk on matters and things in general and your own&#xD;
prospects in particular. By the way, what has become of that Newfoundland dog you had in the&#xD;
water with you when you fished out little Fanny Gould ?"&#xD;
"Beppo? He is at home."&#xD;
"What a queer old prig her papa is'! Never mind him; he is only a cop. The mother is some-&#xD;
body, for she is my sister. I am bringing up that child. We'will talk about that after dinner to-&#xD;
morrow. You will be here at the time, of course ?"&#xD;

" Certainly; I will, sir, if I am alive and nothing happens."&#xD;
" Can't you bring Beppo along too ? Will you sell that dog for a good round price ?"&#xD;
"Sell Beppo ? No, sir! Why should I sell him ?"&#xD;
That's your business.' If you would sell him, I will find you a purchaser who should pay you&#xD;
a good round price for the animal. Old Gould shall give you five hundred dollars for him."&#xD;
" And the old Buster shouldn't have him for five thousand!"&#xD;
" Old Buster! My brother-in-law ! I like that."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, but he has- "&#xD;
"Nonsense. I like your spirit; he is a - old beast, if he is my relative by marriage. But&#xD;
suppose my niece, Fanny, became the real owner ?"&#xD;
"Fanny? If it was for her, I wouldn't sell Beppo, I might give him to her. But then, my moth-&#xD;
er *ould be left lonesome but for Bep."&#xD;
" Good boy; always think of your mother. Still, I'll make old Gould buy the dog to present to&#xD;
Fanny, and I'll make the arrangement so that the deg can spend most of his time with your moth&#xD;
er, if she likes, which he will very likely do. Willthat suit you? Now tell me when are you to&#xD;
graduate ?"&#xD;
"In about two moiiths."&#xD;
"Don't fail to be punctual at Delmonico's to-morrow. It will be for your interest to meet me'&#xD;
and then you will see a dinner, what I, Colonel Vanderhoost, call a dinner; until then, good bye.-&#xD;
Clarence left the Battery for his mother's home; and when the Colonel was alone he mused for&#xD;
a long time. " That young chap is game," thought lie to hingelf. "Got it from his mother. He&#xD;
will succeed eventually. It's in him. He wants a friend--somebody that can and will teach him.&#xD;
I will be that friend, and take him in hand, and if I am not greatly deceived, he will turn up a&#xD;
trump? I must polish him a little, and then introduce him favorably into my brother-in-law's&#xD;
set. Egad, I am in luck. I have got somebody to care for now. I shall have something else to&#xD;
think about besides that infernal Custom House."&#xD;

OVERNMENT officers, or Cu tom House officers,&#xD;
__ -      'as they now generally denominate that class of&#xD;
our patriotic citizens who devote their attention&#xD;
to the revenue interests of the country, and.-&#xD;
~                     their own, were'more respected thirty years ago&#xD;
than they are now. These situations are now&#xD;
given as a reward for partizan service, but in&#xD;
those days they were bestowed for more patriotic&#xD;
service, or given to broken down merchants, or&#xD;
to men eminently qualified to perform the pecu-&#xD;
liar duties which were allotted to them. It was&#xD;
1     a good rule, and the country would be benefitted&#xD;
N C if it were adhered to now. Elections would pos-&#xD;
sess less interest and excitement, qnd thousands&#xD;
of our good citizens who are eager for office,&#xD;
would be quietly minding their legitimate busi-&#xD;
ness, or the pursuits or professions they hafirst,&#xD;
adopted, for luckily ve have not yet arrived at&#xD;
that stage in 'orruption when children and youth&#xD;
are born and educated to be recipients of Custom House emoluments.&#xD;
Col. Vanderhoost, as we have before stated, held a situation in the Custom House. His salary&#xD;
was comfortable, being $1,500 per annum. He was a broken down man of fortune, and a fair sam-&#xD;
ple of that unfortunate class. His history was the history of hundreds in this community. . He&#xD;
was of the pure Knickerbocker breed. In early life he inherited the estate, but not the frugal,&#xD;
economical habits of, his forefathers. At the time he met with Clarence Bolton, he was about&#xD;
forty-five years of age. His father was an eminent merchant, and it was out of regard to him&#xD;
that the then Collector of the port gave to the Colonel an appointment. Old Mr. Vanderhoost, his&#xD;
father, commenced business -soon after the revolution, and had his counting house and store in&#xD;
Bridge street, near Whitehall. He was many years eminent as a merchant, stood at the head of&#xD;
that class, his credit was undoubted, and his standing-on 'Change was A No. 1 He gave his son&#xD;
a collegiate education, and when he was of age took him into his counting room to make a mer-&#xD;
chant of him. This was no easy matter, as the young Vanderhoost was very strongly inclined to&#xD;
shine as a man of fashion, and, did not exhibit the slightest satisfaction with the plodding course&#xD;
hisfather had chosen for him. The wealth of his father, and hie own fair prospects, gave him the&#xD;
en  tr  to every circle of society. He was a young man who had lots of money to spend, and as&#xD;
a very natural consequence, he found numberless friends among both sexes. This did not leave&#xD;
him much time to familiarize his mind with the details of counting house life, or to acquire the&#xD;
O  experience necessary to conduct the business of his father with success. When war broke out be-&#xD;
tween this country and Great Britain, in 1812,.young Vanderhoost held a colonel's commission in&#xD;
that gallant body of soldiers then'(and now) known-as the New York Militia. He was a popular&#xD;
colonel, and had been a man of war from Itis youth upwards, and like many aspiring youths&#xD;
of the present day, he was ambitious of acquiring military renown and glory, but preferred to do&#xD;
so in the timeof peace, not that the Colonel was a coward. No, no, There is no doubt that he&#xD;
Would have led his regiment anywhere when war was declared, if it had been ordered there; but&#xD;
unfortunately his destiny was not to earn distinction in the-glory line, as his command was never&#xD;
ordered further out of town than Yorkville. However, there was no mistake about it, Colonel&#xD;
Vanderhoost was a legitimate Colonel, and-earned his distinction during ethe war, Of course, for&#xD;
the time being he belonged to the regular army, and in after years the government republicss are&#xD;
not always ungratefull) rewarded him, when he stood in need of ifeward, by giving him a plaoe as&#xD;
Inspector of the Cusf6ma.- When peace was proclaimed the Colonel resigned. Soon after, there&#xD;
was to be a gehieral meeting of European warriors in London. Napoleon had been whipped out at'&#xD;

Waterloo, and shipped off to St. Helena. Peace was ensured, and the great warriors of the allied&#xD;
armies were shaking hands and hobnobbing in Paris and London, and our American Colonel deter.&#xD;
mined to go abroad and see some of the fun. Old Mr. Vanderhoost consented, and as a prepara-&#xD;
tory, took his son William into partnership, and when the Colonel took his departure for Europe,-&#xD;
he carried with him to his father's correspondents and bankers in London, Paris, and other places&#xD;
and ports, letters announcing the fact. He remained abroad just two years, when he returned&#xD;
home, having left the pleasing impression in every part of Europe which he had visited during his&#xD;
absence, that he was a noble hearted, generous, and liberal American gentleman, and so he was.&#xD;
His father was convinced of his liberality, for the Colonel's trip had cost him rising of $60,000, and&#xD;
the business he had procured was not worth sixty cents. The acquaintances the Colonel had cul-,&#xD;
tivated were not'of a commercial kind, and never consigned merchandise tq this country. But&#xD;
that didn't matter much, the Colonel returned a polished gentleman, and immediately took the&#xD;
lead in the highest circle of fashion, and kept it for years, even after he had become comparatively&#xD;
poor. 'He was kind-hearted, honorable and generous, and possessed many noble and redeeming&#xD;
qualities. It was immediately after his return that he redeemed Edward Bolton from prison, and&#xD;
rEstored him to his wife, and entitled himself to the lasting gratitude of Clarence, when he was old&#xD;
enough to be made acquainted with the circumstance. . Some few years after his lather's commer-&#xD;
cial firm became bankrupt, and he was a ruined.-man. The affairs were finally settled, and the&#xD;
old Vanderhoost retained a house and soine real estate, which when he died, he left to his two chil-&#xD;
dren. The Colonel had nearly run through his share; but his sister's, which consisted of the real&#xD;
estate, remained in her hands, and eventually became of much value. It was this fact, and the&#xD;
'respectability of the family, that led the broker, Mr. Gould, to secure her for his wife.&#xD;
When the Colonel received an appointment in the Custom House, his financial embarrassments&#xD;
were at an end.&#xD;
This is a mere outline of the Colonel's career. He had become a philosopher, and lived like one.&#xD;
At the time Clarence became acquainted with him he had apartments in Franklin square, in what&#xD;
was known as the Old Walton House.&#xD;
What citizen or stranger has ever&#xD;
passed through Franklin Square,&#xD;
without gazing with interest on an                                        "&#xD;
antiquated, large, three-story edi-&#xD;
fice, built in the English baronial&#xD;
style of the last century? It is&#xD;
called the "Walton House," be-                  WI&#xD;
cause it was erected by an aristo-               N&#xD;
cratical Englishman of that name,&#xD;
Dearly a century ago, and has ever                                                  5&#xD;
since remained in the family. The&#xD;
entrance hall is in the centre of the               M-&#xD;
building, with large, old.fashion-&#xD;
ed, parlors and drawing-rooms on&#xD;
each side. The portal is in fine                                         a&#xD;
keeping with the style of architee-&#xD;
ture, which then distinguished-the&#xD;
English patricians from the ple-&#xD;
beians.&#xD;
The portico is supported by two                                                ___&#xD;
fluted columns, and surmounted&#xD;
with the armorial bearings of the Walton family, richly carved and ornamented ; but, like all&#xD;
insignia of nobility on this side the Atlantic, somewhat the worse for wear. Were we conversant&#xD;
with the technics of heraldry, these arms should be described, but being totally ignorant of the&#xD;
mysteries of that profound science, we are not competent to the task.&#xD;
In this house the Colonel retained a parlor and sleeping room, iAnd lived in the most orthodox&#xD;
bachelor style. An old negro servant, who had lived with him in his palmys days, attended 'to the&#xD;
boot-blacking department ; and a chambermaid, belonging to the family who occupied the man-&#xD;
sion, attended to the arranging of his rooms. The Colonel's meals he procured where it suited him,&#xD;
but generally they were obtained from the celebrated French Restaurant kept by Delmonico 'in&#xD;

&#xD;
William street. The Colonel was a great hand at dining out, and as he had many wealthy friends&#xD;
who were always anxious for his society at dinner, he managed to economize to a great extent in&#xD;
his weekly expenses, by retaining merely rooms. He lived in every respect as an independent but&#xD;
reduced gentleman can always live in this town. His self-respect, the consciousness of who and&#xD;
what he was and -had been, both by birth, education and experience, never deserted him; he&#xD;
maintained his position in the fashionable world, took his drinks at Washington Hall, where Stew-&#xD;
arts great store now stands, and was one of the best players of that originally fashionable gam-&#xD;
bling house, where many of our most promising young men took their first lesson in an accomplish-&#xD;
ment which led to their ultimate ruin. That Washington.Hall sett was the parent of many other&#xD;
setts or clubs, that have since flourished in our town. His word, wherever he moved, was law&#xD;
and gospel. He was the dread of parvenues, whom he detested and hated with most unchristian.&#xD;
like devotion.&#xD;
The Colonel was really delighted with Clarence. He saw at a glance that he possessed uncom-&#xD;
mon cleverness and talent. He had been the friend of the father, and felt that this circumstance&#xD;
gave a sort of claim upon him to the young lad, which he wAs most ready to acknowledge, and&#xD;
take the young fellow by the hand and place him under his special protection. There was another&#xD;
and a very strong motive in the bosom of Colonel Vanderhoost, which prompted him to take such&#xD;
a step. It was this: he wanted. some reasonable being to love; some one that he could feel an in-&#xD;
terest in; some youth to excite him; in a word, one in whom he could live over his life again; and&#xD;
Clarence was precisely the one he wanted. Before he went to sleep on the night following his&#xD;
meeting with Clarence, his mind was made up, and he had determined what course. he would pur-&#xD;
sue in the matter. He wculd to a certain extent adopt that young man, and act towards him as&#xD;
if he was his own son.&#xD;
aI will.finish hiseducation for the world. I will bring him out, polish him, and as he goes&#xD;
along the every day road of life, I will point out to him where to make a hit, and where not to&#xD;
attempt it; and," reasoned the Colonel, "if his future career for a few years should justify my&#xD;
expectations, I will leave him my property."&#xD;
Laugh not, dear reader, for we must tell you that the friendship of a man, who has traveled for&#xD;
years on the various roads of the world, who is acquainted with them, who knows the distances&#xD;
the halting places, the turnings in and out, the gates, the bridges, the mile-stones, and the guide&#xD;
posts; and who has acquired this knowledge at a costly price, and from actual experience, can be&#xD;
of more service to a young and talented lad, just merging into early manhood and putting his&#xD;
foot into the great world, is worth a dozen fortunes, or a score of rich relations and friends.&#xD;
Colonel Vanderhoost was in earnest in the matter. He knew the world, its weak points,.and felt&#xD;
.perfectly confident that he would take that unlicked cub, (as he called Clarence,) and mould him&#xD;
into almost any shape he pleased; carve out for him just such a career as he wished ; guide him&#xD;
into the same avenue to fortune and power, as he himself would pursue, if he could drop a score&#xD;
and a half of years, and go back to early manhood. The Colonel did not sleep well that night;&#xD;
his mind was full of the new subject, and tormented with the fear that at the meeting the next&#xD;
dgy, something would turn up that would frustrate all his plans-that he might have formed too&#xD;
-0 high an estimate of the abilities of the youth, and that a few hours more of personal acquaintance,&#xD;
would prove him to be made of stuff not worth meddling with. Then he reasoned'that if he found&#xD;
Clarence to be worth trying his hand upon, he should have innumerable new things to do at once.&#xD;
He thought seriously over what he should say to Clarence when they would meet at dinner, and&#xD;
then, too, there was the mother of Clarence, what would she think or say of his plans? Strange&#xD;
as it may appear, Colonel Vanderhoost, a perfect man of the world, one that'could create a sensa-&#xD;
tion in a ball room by his entrance, or upset a fashionable party by laughing atthe jelly, sneering&#xD;
at the ice cream and pronouncing it "not the thing," was anxious about what he should say or&#xD;
do at a dinner, with a mere boy! But so it was, and it was some hours ere he decided what was&#xD;
to be done. He knew that the boy was kind and grateful; but the Colonel had his own Weak&#xD;
points. He felt the value of first impressions upon that lad's mind. He knew that unless at the&#xD;
fstserious interview, he could inspire Clarence with a full sense of his (the Colonel's) superiority&#xD;
no only to himself, but to everybody he had yet met with, that his labor would be lost. At last,&#xD;
he had it all arranged satisfactorily in his own mind as to what was to be done, and then ho put.&#xD;
on hs silk night cap, went to bed, slept, and dreamed of his own past and mistaken career, and&#xD;
tath was Clarence-that he had been born again.&#xD;

In the afternoon when Clarence left Colonel Vanderhoost upon the Battery, he went home to&#xD;
the residence of his mother. After he had ate his bread and milk supper, he narrated to her the&#xD;
events of the day, and then sat himself-down to his books, and studied away at them until long&#xD;
after midnight.&#xD;
The ensuing day, after College hours had passed, he went down town to Delmonico's long before&#xD;
the'appointed hour of five, fearful lest he should disappoint the Colonel. It was the first time&#xD;
that he had ever been inside of that celebrated French Restaurant; and, when he had taken his&#xD;
seat inside of the drawing room, where he awaited the arrival of the Colonel, he watched the&#xD;
movements of the assorted congregation of diners, who were getting their dinners at the innumera-&#xD;
ble small tables, with undisguised astonishment. He was in his element too; for, with the lan-&#xD;
guage in which the orders were given, he was as familiar as with his own tongue. He had ac-&#xD;
quired a perfect knowledge of the French from his grandmother, who never conversed with him&#xD;
in any other language but that, and for the very excellent reason, that she did not understand&#xD;
any other.&#xD;
Precisely at five Colonel Vanderhoost arrived, and saluted Clarence in the most cordial and&#xD;
friendly manner, and made a decided impression at the sane time upon the mind of Clarence, by&#xD;
the dignified bearing which he assumed.&#xD;
"So, Clarence," said he, "you are watching the canaille take their feed? But come, let's&#xD;
leave these animals to their own pasture, and go up to a private room, where we can dine by our.&#xD;
selves. Gargon, show me my dining room," added the Colonel, addressing one of the numerous&#xD;
waiters.&#xD;
Clarence complied, and while they were following the waiter to another apartment, he&#xD;
did feel an increased respect for the Colonel, and the latter gentleman was not slow in perceiving&#xD;
it. InIthe-room-to which they were taken, there was a table spread and covers arranged for two&#xD;
persons, and only two: Clarence admiired the Colonel still more. He was not aware that he&#xD;
had been there before, and ordered 'everything arranged just as Clarence found- it. 'When&#xD;
they had taken their seats, Clarence began to feel nervous and fearful lest he should make some&#xD;
blunder, and astonish the Colonel by his awkwardness ; for he had never dined out before. The&#xD;
tColonel saw his ruse was operating, and was satisfied. He had dined young men before, but when&#xD;
lhe had done so inl former days, it was because they had money, and he had designs'of his own,&#xD;
.and the young men paid pretty dearly for the dinner and the honor of being on dining terms with&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
so fashionable a man as Colonel Vanderhoost; but now, for the first time in many years, the *&#xD;
Colonel had a love dinner. He was training, or rather, he was about to prepare a young man to&#xD;
be trained, because he liked him, and wished to have him succeed in life, and be an honor to his&#xD;
own handiwork; and as they sat at the table, and he regarded the noble, bearing, the manly fea-&#xD;
tui'es, the piercing eyes, and marked character of his young friend, he began to feel a new sort&#xD;
of parental pride, and inwardly determined that it should be no fault of his, if the lad Clarence&#xD;
did not make a sensation in New York before he died.&#xD;
"Now, my boy," said the Colonel, " make yourself perfectly at home. Here comes the gareon&#xD;
with the soup. Always eat soup before you make your regular dinner. I learned that in Paris&#xD;
some years ago. . Every gentleman uses soup for his dinner when he can get it. Remember that."&#xD;
Clarence said he would try to do so.&#xD;
"That's all right. I have got good news for you, Master Clarence-keep on swallowing your&#xD;
soup-only listen. I have seen your friend, old Gould, Fanny's father. Do you know, master&#xD;
Clarence, that I think that little girl is rather fond of you ? Of course she is; you saved her life,'&#xD;
and she ought to be; but as for her father, coin him, he is only a cop. What do you think he&#xD;
said about you ?"&#xD;
Clarence was taken all aback, andmerely replied that he did not know.&#xD;
"Wants you to come and dine with him to-morrow."&#xD;
"Me, sir?" replied the bewildered lad. "Why, what on eArth has changed his opinion? It&#xD;
was only a few days ago that he treated me worse than he did my dog Beppo. What does he want&#xD;
now ?"&#xD;
"Wants you to come and dine with him. He changed his opinion of your merits whenI in-&#xD;
formed him that you was a friend of William Vaaderhoost's. Qargon, remove the potage and the&#xD;
dirty plates, and bring up the next course. Clarence,-what wine-do you prefer ?"&#xD;
"Me, sir! None at all; I never drink it. I'll take a glass,of milk."&#xD;
"Milk !" Milk, I think you said? Clarence, my dear boy, gentlemen never drink milk; it's&#xD;
the nourishment for babes and country people. Delmonico don't keep anything of that sort in his&#xD;
house. Try oome kind of wine. Garcon, bring me up a bottle of Chateau Margeau, the very best.&#xD;
You must try that, Clarence, with a little water. I must bring .you on, by degrees, and induct&#xD;
you gradually.&#xD;

CHAPTER         VIII,&#xD;
CONTENTS-The dinner-Clarence accepts the invitation to dine with Mr. Gould--Colonel 'Vandeiho6st's description of&#xD;
the different kiijdis of blood with an illustration -le visits tho mother of Clarence--plate, dog Beppo--shows&#xD;
his lntereot in the welfare of, and his advice to, Clarence.&#xD;
AVING been obliged to close the last chapter'&#xD;
abruptly, we left Colonel Vanderhoost and Clar-&#xD;
ence chatting very cosily while dining together&#xD;
in a room at Delmonicos. In reply to the obser-&#xD;
vation of the Colonel that he should order some&#xD;
claret, Clarence said he was contented to drink&#xD;
-Ol            that or anything else the Colonel preferred, and&#xD;
asked with apparent interest, "Did Mr. Gould&#xD;
really ask me to come and dine with him ?"&#xD;
"To be sure he did. It was rather imperti-&#xD;
nent in him, was it not? But then he is only a&#xD;
b.               -cop, and don't know what's what; but as I&#xD;
thought you rather liked my pretty niece, Itold&#xD;
- -        -   him I wonlg try to persuade you to accept the&#xD;
invite. I patronise him altogether on account&#xD;
of his wife, she being, as you are aware, my sis-&#xD;
ter. She has blood. By the way, do you under-&#xD;
stand perfectly what blood means ?"&#xD;
Clarence was struck dumb; the idea that it&#xD;
was a piece of impertinence on the part of the rich&#xD;
broker to ask him to dine with him was a novel one. The Colonel knew that he had made one of&#xD;
his points, and waited a moment for Clarence to reply, and as he did not do so, he continued:&#xD;
4 Tell me first whether you will accept the invitation to dine with Mr. Gould? If you feel at&#xD;
all doubtful as to its compromising you to do so, have no scruples to tell me as your best friend of it,&#xD;
and I may as well tell you that there is no particular harm in it, The world understands these&#xD;
things properly. When a gentleman both by birth and education, who happens to be poor, asso-&#xD;
ciates with a cop, or a man who has merely money, dines with him, goes to his parties, and speaks&#xD;
to him in1thestreet, everybody knows that the object of the one is to add to his own stock of respec-&#xD;
tability and character by associating with a gentleman who has both, while the other in very wil-&#xD;
ling to extend his patronage for a good dinner, which his limited means perhaps don't often&#xD;
allow him to enjoy; and a rich broker will frequently loan money under these circumstances, Which&#xD;
of course it is understood he never expects to get back again. These are mere trifles, but it is&#xD;
well that you should know them."&#xD;
Clarence simply replied, "thank you, Colonel, for procuring me the invitation. I will accept&#xD;
it with the greatest pleasure, although I shall feel awkward, for I never have been to great men's&#xD;
houses often."&#xD;
Rich men! Cops, Clarence; don't call them gentlemen. There is a wide distinction. It is as&#xD;
hard in this country for z rich man to be a great man as it is supposed generally to be-that they&#xD;
should inherit the kingdom of heaven. Now then, answer my question, do you understan&amp;amp;,the&#xD;
meaning of blood as used in general society ?"&#xD;
"Candidly, Colonel, I do not suppose I do. I k'now what blood is, but probably.not the mean-&#xD;
ing you apply to the word. What is your explanation ? Are there different kinds of blood?&#xD;
"Most unquestionably. There are several kinds of blood. There is good and bad blood, and&#xD;
one can tell the class to which a man 'belongs, as certainly by one look at him, as he can at a&#xD;
horse. It runs in families. Some men will rise above their early position, no matter where you'&#xD;
place them. You can see it in their childhood or boyhood. Their eyes, the contour of their face,&#xD;
all betray the nobility of soul that is enshrined in the body, no matter whether it is covered with&#xD;
rags, or not. I can tell the probable fate of a ragged boy in the street, or one in the 'parlor of&#xD;
the richest merchant. They have the same characteristic marks ad a horse. You have heard of&#xD;
horse jockeys of course ? Well, let me tell you there are as good man jockeys in this town, and I&#xD;
profess to be one, and I flatter myself that I cannot often be deceived. Now, look into it yourself,&#xD;
Clarence. You have good blood: no one need look at you twice to see ,that. Your mother was&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
descended from an old foreign stock-French, but good; your father ws of the pilgrim breed.- 9&#xD;
common, but good. He was only a carpenter, andyet you may be President of this country. You&#xD;
will succeed, and besomebody. You have got it in you, and it's in the blood. Now, I can go into&#xD;
families here who have wealth, I will pick out their children, and in nine cases out of ten, they&#xD;
will all be snobs, nobodys. They may have money, become rich, but. they will never make men&#xD;
of any calibre or great usefulness ; and the chances are, that when they have squandered what&#xD;
wealth their fathers leave 'when they die, that they will go into the gutter where they belong.&#xD;
They have got no blood to keep them up. I am as poor as Job's turkey, but I have got blood, I&#xD;
am Dutch. I can trace back my descent beyond the Revolution-back behind that to the days of&#xD;
old Peter Stuy vesent, and still mote remote, to the early emigre ation of my ancestors from Holland,&#xD;
when Nbw York was first discovered. I respect myself. Blood is blood, while its alive. Money&#xD;
is money, and it's nothing else: It ain't blood. Anybody can have money, but they can't have&#xD;
good blood. Brokers like Gould can have money, but they will always be mere cops. They have&#xD;
nothing running in their veins but colored water; it ain't blood; it's absolution of aqua and the&#xD;
root of all evil: but it'will keep a man alive in this town, and make him respected by the great&#xD;
majority of people, who merely look at the surface of things. Now, I will illustrate iit by giving&#xD;
you a design. Lend me your pencil. I've got an old letter about me, and I will draw you two&#xD;
horses and two men, and show you what I mean."&#xD;
The Colonel proceeded to draw a sketch, while Clarence remained silent. When it was finished,&#xD;
he passed it across the table to his young admirer.&#xD;
&#xD;
"There, Clarence, just look at the points of the two and the four footed animals. You see a&#xD;
young man inrags, and another one in fine clothes and dressed to the top of the fashions. One has&#xD;
the stamp of God about him; the other, the stamp of a tailor. Note that, and then look at the&#xD;
other group of the two horses. 'One is a spirited race horse; the other is a cart horse. You don't&#xD;
want to be told that, you see it in a glance. Treasure these points and study them well, and in&#xD;
your future career you will be able to make nice distinction between different species of men as.&#xD;
well as horses ; and now let's have a bottle of champagne, smoke a cigar, and then I want you to,'&#xD;
accompany me to your own home. I want to see that mother of yours."&#xD;
When the *ine had been drank, the mangof the world and th6 College boy took leave of Delmoni-&#xD;
co's, and started for the widow's cottage. It was nearly eight in the evening when the Colonel&#xD;
and Clarence reached the home of the latter.&#xD;
" You will hardly recognize my mother, Colonel, it is so long since you have seen her."&#xD;

&#xD;
"1Ishall, unless she has changed very much.".&#xD;
When the two entered, the widow heard the voice of Clarence, and opened the parlor door; as&#xD;
she did so, her son observed:&#xD;
"Here I am, dear mother, and with me is an old acquaintance of yours."&#xD;
"Dear lady, many years have passed since we last met, and I  am moat glad to meet you again;&#xD;
and I am indebted to your gallant son for the opportunity. You are not much changed. One&#xD;
would hardly think that some seventeen years have passed over our heads since I last had this&#xD;
pleasure."&#xD;
The widow smiled, as she invited the Colonel to a seat, and remarked that she was pleased to&#xD;
renew the acquaintance, although it brought to her mind some painful memories.&#xD;
"You are a little older, Colonel, and yet it does not seem so. Clarence told me that he had&#xD;
seen you, and was to dine with you to day. I was glad to hear it, and to know that you have&#xD;
taken some interest in him, Colonel. It is a critical period of his life, and he is all that is left&#xD;
me in'this world."&#xD;
The widow had taken a seat by the side of Clarence on the sofa, and as she made the last re-&#xD;
mark, she put her arm aroun d his waist and kissed him. It was a holy scene, and as the man of&#xD;
the World looked at that mother and son, almost alone in the world, and all in all to each other,&#xD;
his good intentions towards the lad were doubly strengthened, and he replied :&#xD;
"iMy dear lady, I ought to have seen you and your boy before this, but I have-"&#xD;
." Don't speak of what is past, Colonel. We have all had our troubles. Mine have been very&#xD;
severe, and I have heard that you have had much sorrow. I have ceased to look back. I only&#xD;
look forward now to the time when Clarence will be settled in the world, and will no longer need&#xD;
a mother's care and watchfulness, and I shall die in peace.&#xD;
"A widow with such a boy as that to lean upon? You have everything to hope for in the&#xD;
future, and I have no doubt that you will'live to see him a rich man, and spend many years of&#xD;
comfort with him when you become old."&#xD;
"Riches have very little charm for me. I wish to see him make a good and useful man, and&#xD;
so long as he has the necessaries of life, I care very little whether he is rich or poor."&#xD;
" That is all very well, widow; but riches, you must grant, are very comfortable and very use-&#xD;
ful. He will be rich before he dies; but no matter about that now. I have made him bring me&#xD;
up here to renew our old acquaintance, for I really feel very much interested in him, and we can&#xD;
talk over his prospects hereafter, now that I have found the way up here. He will find in me a&#xD;
sincere friend, and though I have not got quite as much money as I had when you first knew me,&#xD;
yet I have got a greatdeal more experience, and am acquainted with hundreds'of men who can&#xD;
serve the interest of Clarence. He graduates in a few days ?"&#xD;
"Yes, he will leave College in a few weeks."&#xD;
"And what do you design to do with him then ?"&#xD;
"I have not decided. Something will turn up I suppose; at any rate, I inust look out for some-&#xD;
thing whereby he can begin to earn a livelihood for himself."&#xD;
"Leave that to me.  He shall be put in a way of earning that, and more to. But we will&#xD;
leave that matter until he graduates. Then it will be time enough to think of a profession for&#xD;
him."&#xD;
" I feel easier in my mind, Colonel Vanderhoost, since I have seen you, for I should tell an un--&#xD;
truth, did I not say that I have unbounded confidence in your ability to direct his course, and&#xD;
lace him in the way of doing something for a living, far better than a poor widow can do; and&#xD;
when you hear of any opening for him, I trust you will advise him what to do, for his father's&#xD;
sake."&#xD;
"Yes, and for yours, too; not only that, I feel inclined to do all in my power to promote his&#xD;
future welfare, for his own sake. He is a bright and promising boy, and his devotion to his mo-&#xD;
-ther is not the least good trait in his character. A good son will make a good friend. _One can&#xD;
trust him. It will notIbe long, widow, before I see you again. I have a brother-in-law, a Mr.&#xD;
Gould, of whom Clarence has doubtless spoken to you. Clarence has rendered him a most essen.-&#xD;
tial service in saving the life of one of his children, and it has not yet been properly acknowledged;&#xD;
but in my hands, lady, all such matters will be put straight ,Mr. Gould has invited'Clarence to&#xD;
become acquainted with his family, and we are engaged to dine there to-morrow. I trust you&#xD;
will make no objection to his doing so. I have very good reasons that he should, for I think I can&#xD;
&#xD;
manage matters in such a way as to make him a most useful and willing friend to y our son; and&#xD;
Mr. Gould has the means to be of service-to any one situated as Clarence now is."&#xD;
" Do with my son as you please in this matter. I consent very cheerfully to his dining with&#xD;
Mr. Gould; but I will say one thing, Colonel: Do not do anything or give Clarence any acquaint-&#xD;
ances or associations that may withdraw his heart and love from his mother."&#xD;
"Have no fear of that; and now, Clarence, there is one meniber of youth family that I have not&#xD;
seen, and for reasons which I intend to keep to myself for the present. I am most anxious to see&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Ah, Colonel, I know who it is you want to see, Beppo. Mother, where is Bep ?"&#xD;
" Out in the back yard, my son. Go for him"&#xD;
Clarence went out for a moment, and when he returned he was accompanied by noble dog of&#xD;
the Newfoundland breed.&#xD;
" There, Colonel, this is                                      -&#xD;
Beppo !&#xD;
" And a splendid animal&#xD;
it is, Clarence. ~Come here,&#xD;
Beppo ?" But Bep took no&#xD;
notice of the Colonel except  -if&#xD;
to eye him  rather -suspi-&#xD;
ciously, as if curious to know&#xD;
what sort of a stranger was&#xD;
occupying a position in the&#xD;
family circle, where he had                            -&#xD;
no business.&#xD;
"He is rather shy of ma-&#xD;
king new acquaintances, Co.&#xD;
lonel," said the widow; "but&#xD;
he will soon recognize you&#xD;
when'he notices that we&#xD;
treat you as a friend."&#xD;
"He is certainly worth&#xD;
the trouble of getting ac-&#xD;
quainted with. He would&#xD;
be a most serviceable animal in a case of danger."&#xD;
"Indeed, would he. The fact is, when Clarence is away, and Beppo is about, I feel quite as safe&#xD;
in the house, as if I had a dozen men servants at hand."&#xD;
"I must leave you now, Mrs. Bolton, for I have still an engagement to fulfil to-night. I shall&#xD;
call up before-long, and hope to have some pleasant information to communicate to you. Don't for-&#xD;
get your engagement to-morrow, Clarence. Good night."&#xD;
"I will be punctual," replied Clarence, and an hour afterwards found Colonel Vanderhoost i4&#xD;
another part of the city, and surrounded by a far different association than the widow and her&#xD;
son. What those associations were will form material for a distinct chapter.&#xD;
Clarence had agreed to meet the Colonel the next day at three o'clock. When that hour arrived&#xD;
he was at the rendezvous appointed, which was in the smoking rooms of Delmonico. The Colonel&#xD;
was already there. As Clarence approached him, 'he rose and shook him cordially by the hand,&#xD;
and asked after his mother; and added, "Now, my dear boy, sit down; I did not finish with all&#xD;
that I had to say to you yesterday. I wanted to give you some advice about Mr. Gould, which&#xD;
may be of songe service to you."&#xD;
" Clarence, my innocent child, the parsons about this village-chaps that feed high, have all the&#xD;
good things of~this life-the finest women for wives, the fattest sheep, the best furnished houses,&#xD;
hickory wood for their fires, and magnificent churches in which to tell people that the world is all&#xD;
afieeting show for man's illusion given-all vexation, and there is nothing true but heaven, and&#xD;
so forth, are small cops. It ain't soi. We are placed in the world for fun. There is a general&#xD;
mixed up fight going on, and those who whip and come off conquerors are decidedly the cleverest&#xD;
people. Who are the lookers on or backers, I don't know. 'It may be.Old Scratch himself;: but&#xD;
it ain't of no consequence. Now I regard you in this light. You ar~e about to go into that great&#xD;
prize ring, the world. I hope you will win. I want you to do so. I am too old to onter again,,&#xD;

and in my early years I didn't have fair play. I can fight in person no longer. I must make up&#xD;
my losses on you, consequently I want to train you right. I will be your trainer, for I don't want&#xD;
you to make any foolish moves or strikes. When I discover a good chance for yott, I want you to&#xD;
make a hit., This' city is your ring. Men and women, generally speaking, are humbugs in&#xD;
the abstract, but not in the reality. Now I waxt you to advise with ie in every important mat!&#xD;
ter. We must now start for the residence'of Mr. Gould. You are right thus far in that quarter.&#xD;
Keep so. By the way, how is Beppo to-day ? I must introduce that fellow to my little Spaniel&#xD;
Rover. A most extraordinary dog mine is, to be sure. He knows a cop in a moment. Your dog&#xD;
is worth a large amount of money at any time you may feeli1nclined to dispose of him. Mr. Gould&#xD;
will pay a high price for him. When you are in need of funds, we can let the broker have the dog."&#xD;
"But I won't sell him, Colonel; it would break my mother's heart."&#xD;
"That is all right enough; still, if you want money' we will sell him to Mr. Gould. The dog&#xD;
knows his way home, don't he ?"&#xD;
"Yes, but then that wouldn't be fair ?"&#xD;
That has nothing to do with you-nothing whatever. You sell Gould the dog, and you get&#xD;
the money. That is your business. What the dog does is his. If he don't like to stay at Gould's&#xD;
house, if he is a sensible dog, he will put out of it, and go back to your mother. Of course he&#xD;
will. However, if Gould buys Beppo, it will be on Fanny's account, and if you have conscientious&#xD;
I     scruples about the matter, or want the dog to travel with you, all you have to do is to travel with&#xD;
Fanny."&#xD;
'I would give her Beppo."&#xD;
"Eh ? Where is your mother in that arrangement? Another thing, don't be foolish, Never&#xD;
give a cop's-daughter anything. Let her give you, and make it a general rule in all your future&#xD;
intercourse with the world, society and individuals, never to give away anything-never make a&#xD;
present under any circumstances, or if you do, make it a point to give away only what has been&#xD;
given to you. Never do that unless with a definite object. The Arabs are a very sensible people&#xD;
on that particular point. Adopt the Arab custom. When you make a present of any value, never&#xD;
do so until you have a dead sure thing in your eye. Then you may give away anything that you&#xD;
don't want for something that you really do require, particularly if the object you get in return'&#xD;
is far more precious and valuable than your gifts. This is important in society; remember and&#xD;
act up to it. Now it wants ten minutes to four. Gould is a very exact man, and dines precisely&#xD;
at four. I will leave you, and be there in time. Don't you follow me for half an hour. It will&#xD;
make an impression, and when you do arrive, as an excuse, tell an out and outer, and say that,&#xD;
the reason of your being so late was occasioned by your having entirely forgotten the engagement:&#xD;
Cops and low people always entertain a profound respect for people who exhibit the most perfect&#xD;
contempt for them and their arrangements. Now, good bye, for half an hour, when I expect to&#xD;
see you at Mr. Gould's in Bowling Green Row.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
CONTENTS-All about foreigners with assumed titles jnd the inanner they gull the New York aristocracy.&#xD;
N the denouement of the plot of this story, our&#xD;
readers will find that we have no idea of jumping&#xD;
and skipping along, regardless of everything but&#xD;
kicking up an unhealthy excitement in the minds&#xD;
of those who are willing to follow Clarence Bolton&#xD;
to the end of.his career. Thatis the way modern&#xD;
writers get up an ephemeral reputation; we don't&#xD;
intend to be imitators: We have our own ideas&#xD;
of these matters, and intend to carry them out.&#xD;
We shall administer this story to our readers&#xD;
precisely as we would a well arranged meal of&#xD;
victuals-commence with the soup, then follows&#xD;
the solids, and finally the dessert.&#xD;
At the dinner given to Clarence by Colonel,&#xD;
Vanderhoost, that gentleman merely informed&#xD;
the lad that he had seen Mr. Gould, and that the&#xD;
latter had invited Clarence to dine.. Colonel V.&#xD;
was not a-man to waste words in explaining what&#xD;
Clarence would have found it very difficult to&#xD;
understand, vif: that the Colonel had been ob-&#xD;
liged to take a great deal of trouble and make a great many explanations and suggestions before&#xD;
he obtained from the rich broker the invitation which Clarence had accepted, without dreaming&#xD;
that the purse-proud inviter had supposed he was doing an uncommon, out of the way sort of&#xD;
matter. Clarence was surprised-and could not easily account for the sudden change in the broker's&#xD;
feelings. We shall drop the narrative style, and fill up the intermediate space between the dinner&#xD;
at Delmonico's and the dinner at the broke's, and give an insight into the manner in which the&#xD;
worldly wise Colonel operated upon the broiler, by appealing to the well known weakness of the&#xD;
wealthy but parvenu class of this community of Which Mr. Gould was a fair specimen. This will&#xD;
form the subject of this chapter. If it appears overdrawn or incredible, let the reader cast a look&#xD;
about him and he will perceive even this same weakness in a grosser guise than we dare pourtray&#xD;
it: It is the kneeling down of wealth and ignorance to mere pretention, or what it does not un.&#xD;
derstand.&#xD;
A wealthy shipping merchant will overlook the honest, deserving clerk who has been with him&#xD;
for years, and whose integrity and activity have been. one of the causes which have given 'the&#xD;
principal wealth; a man of unstained character, and of the purest habits and associations, one&#xD;
whom he has and would trust with untold gold, who is by birth, education and general intelli-&#xD;
gence, .superior to himself perhaps; and yet, the mere fact that he is nothing but a clerk - his&#xD;
own clerk, will cause that merchant to overlook his value and his services, and make him to be&#xD;
excluded from, a private social equality with himself or his (the merchant's) family. Ile regards&#xD;
that clerk and his family as his inferiors-as belonging to a different strata of society; in a word,&#xD;
he treats him exactly as a South Carolinian planter would conduct himself towards a good slave.&#xD;
He treats him kindly while he is at his daily task, gives him the provision for his support, but&#xD;
allows no intimacy or freedom off the p antation, or outside of the counting-room. Even if the&#xD;
clerk is unmarried, he seldom or never\ ask him to his house to a dinner or social party, or gives&#xD;
him an equality introduction to his mily, for he is nothing but a clerk, while at the same time&#xD;
a casual introduCtion to some individual whom he has never met before, but who has an imaginary or&#xD;
,real' title, or self-made claims to position, will cause hhit to open wide the doors of his house, intro-&#xD;
ducerthe unknown stranger (of whose real private character he'is necessarily ignorant) into his&#xD;
household circle, at his dinner table, and to his wife's parties; and yetthis very man may be the&#xD;
veriest swindler out of Sing Sing. If he isentirely unknown, a man of good address and great&#xD;
pretensions, may ring into the- best (?) --wealthiest society in New York. It is the easiest thing'&#xD;
Imaginable, and when we hear of the peace of families destroyed, or rich men's daughters cor-&#xD;

&#xD;
rupted or run away with by somebody, Who is really unknown, we are only surprised that it&#xD;
is no-t an every hour occurrence. Fathers have only to blame their own foolish imprudence in the-&#xD;
result.&#xD;
Who is there among us that has not had his attention attracted to the fact, that, an unknown'&#xD;
foreigner, with a good pair of moustaches and the impudence of Lucifer, finds almost immediate&#xD;
entrance into our " upper circles," as the associations of the mongrel or more wealthy class of&#xD;
families arefalsely denominated? Is it all a matter of surprise or wonderment then, that adven-&#xD;
turers, impostors and humbugs, crowd our city, crowd our hotels and swindle the honest but mid-&#xD;
dling classes of society, when they are received, tolerated, caressed and endorsed by the wives and&#xD;
families of rich merchants and citizens? Is it at all a matter of astonishment, when this weakness&#xD;
is so widely known, that foreigners should flock to this town, and that when they arrive destitute&#xD;
and penniless, they should take immediate advantage of it, and of circumstance to favor their own&#xD;
views, promote their own interests, provide food for their mouths, and clothes for their persons ?&#xD;
They would be fools if they did not do it, and have plenty to eat and drink, wealthy acquaiht-&#xD;
ances, and be the best dressed men in town. What chance would a plain, honest shoemaker,&#xD;
tailor, cook, barber, or valet have in this town, to be caressed and distinguished by our richest&#xD;
citizens, if his only merit rested upon his real former position, and only claimed the rights of&#xD;
exercising his own legitimate profession ? His chances of starvation, after he had exhausted his&#xD;
own little capital, would be first rate, unless he fell in with people who would appreciate d pay&#xD;
hint for what he really could do to earn a livelihood.  -&#xD;
We will relate an instance that came under our own observation some years ago, when we was&#xD;
a mere boy. In 1830, the brig Sabbattas, Captain Howard, arrived at this port from Marseilles,&#xD;
in France. Among her passengers was a very gentlemanly Frenchman and his family. Were we&#xD;
to mention his name, he would be recognized by -thousands who afterwards madehis acquaintance.&#xD;
&#xD;
Well, our foreign friend, the French gentleman, presented himself at the counting-room of&#xD;
a large shipping, house, hat in hand, and graceful as only a Frenchman can be, and was shown&#xD;
into the private office of the senior of the firm. Mutual bowings and salutations took place, and&#xD;
the polite Frenchman presented his letter. The merchant invited the gentlemanly stranger to a&#xD;
seat, while he carefnlly read his letter of introduction. It was an ordinary one, and signed by&#xD;
the celebrated firm of Pitch, Freres Cetie, of Marseilles. It stated that the bearer was an honest&#xD;
man, who had been gnilty of some republican freedom, (it was a short time previous to the expulr&#xD;
sion ol' Charles X. from France,) and requested the New York firm to exert their good offices in&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.                                   45&#xD;
his behalf, "and that any favors extended would be duly appreciated,when an opportunity would&#xD;
be afforded to reciprocate, &amp;amp;c." so far so good. When the merchant had finished reading the&#xD;
letter, he grasped the French gentleman's hand, gave him a cordial welcome, talked to him about&#xD;
dynasties kings, vines, wines and society, for nearly an hour  At last, the French gentleman&#xD;
rose to take his departure, and then the merchant, after begging his new French friend to excuse&#xD;
any apparent want of etiquette, and to'" go up and take a quiet dinner with me at my house, and&#xD;
spend the evening with my family, who intend visiting the theatre, where we shall be happy to&#xD;
have you accompany us. By the way, my lady is learning French, and woild be delighted to meet&#xD;
and converse with an educated French gentleman in his own language."&#xD;
What could the French gentleman do but accept such a cordial.invitation, clothed in such grace-&#xD;
ful language, and given with such open heartfelt interest? He was charmed. He had no words&#xD;
to reply that could properly express his feelings. He had found social equality. He had found&#xD;
republicanism and democracy in glorious perfection. When the ecstacies of both had somewhat&#xD;
subsided, and the French gentleman accepted the invitation, the merchant added:&#xD;
" Now, my dear sir, as it will be half an hour before my carriage will be here to convey us up&#xD;
to my residence, you may as well confide to me any business or plans which you have in view.&#xD;
Speak freely."&#xD;
" Tank you. I wish to get one leetle place for my famille, and where I can do my vork," said&#xD;
France.&#xD;
"Oh, ah, I perceive. You are temporarily reduced-embarrassed,! should say-and are willing&#xD;
to submit gracefully to your misfortune, and make the best of them. Excellent man, I admire&#xD;
and honor you. What profession did you follow in France? Medical, legal-or perhaps you lived&#xD;
the life of a retired gentleisan on your vineyards?"&#xD;
" Oh, non," and then the excellent man informed his mercantile friend that his former occupn-&#xD;
tion had been that of a journeyman tailor, and that he was on the look out for a snug place with a&#xD;
cheap rent, where he could start business and elevate a shingle.&#xD;
"Boolk-keeper! Joseph! come here," shouted the merchant, "Are these bills of lading signed?&#xD;
have those 250 bales of cotton gone on board the Europe ydt ?--by the way, I must look after those&#xD;
matters myself, and out of his sanctum he marched without a word of apology to his guest. In the&#xD;
general counting room he spoke to the bookkeeper, and said he was going home--to tell the coach-&#xD;
man when he arrived with the carriage that he had gone, and meanwhile to go in his private&#xD;
office and talk to that Frenchman, see what he wanted, and tell him that he had an unexpected en-&#xD;
gagement, and should not return, and-he did not.&#xD;
The surprised Frenchman never understood the exact meaning of the sudden change in the mer-&#xD;
chant's manner until he had lived in New York some years, and become somewhat extensively ao-&#xD;
quainted among our weidthy men. He got a place, and was For some months a "tailleur" in the&#xD;
second floor of the old wooden building that used to stand next door to Masonic Hall, in Broadway.&#xD;
Then he started the Caf6 des Mille Colonnes opposite' made a moderate fortune, and went back to&#xD;
France. lie lived long enough to witness one of Fortune's sudden somersets, and to see the day&#xD;
when he could have bought his first merchant friend ten times over.&#xD;
When he was crilled upoi to give advice to any emigrating French friend, would he recommend&#xD;
him to go to New York And present' himself there as- an honest French tailor, when it was just as&#xD;
easy to perform the part of count? Certainly not. A man who has bedn through the mill, lived&#xD;
in this city, and made himself familiar with its customs and opinions, and-become acquainted with&#xD;
the foibles and aristocratic weaknesses of her prominent men, would give the best worldly advice&#xD;
in recommending his friends to take the highest position possible onarrival, no matterwhatlevel he&#xD;
found afterward.&#xD;
A foreigner may arrive here under precisely similar circumstances in which the French friend&#xD;
did, to whom we have made allusion,.belonging to either Spain, Germany, France, Italy, Hungary,&#xD;
or Poland, and if he is shrewd. cunning, intelligent, and. rightly advised, he will mal e his debut&#xD;
among us as a nobleman-who has been deeplyy compromised in some revolutionary movement, and&#xD;
has been exiled by a tyrannical and cruel government from the home of his youth, the associations&#xD;
of his childhood, and his noble companions and his princely domains. Of course he has This class&#xD;
of foreign gentlemen, instead of hailing from every nation known, should be classified as .Moonites,&#xD;
as their castles in fortunes and prospects are found nowhere else but in the land of thie moon.&#xD;
-'Tailors, coblers, hair-dressers, valets, and hotel servants from Europe, -can make their appearance&#xD;

&#xD;
in our Gotham unknown and without any danger of -ever being known. One of this class is not&#xD;
generally unknowing. He may be penniless, but he is perfectly aware of the mania of the upper&#xD;
class,,or mongrel classes, for foreigners, and therefore 'he lands as a distinguished foreigner either&#xD;
with or without a title. In his own country he was merely the plain valet or servant to some&#xD;
titled man, or a public hair-dresser and barber of a high cast and aristocratic tendencies, and was&#xD;
brought in constant contact and association with polished and refined gentlemen. To a certain&#xD;
extent he has acquired their ease of manner, modes of expression, tastes, and can ape and imitate&#xD;
them without being discovered by New, York novices,.or wealthy vulgarity. He has only to choose&#xD;
some aristocratic name, and his fortune is made by a pair of mustaches, and his assumed cogno-&#xD;
men. He has probably a few francs in his pocket, the economical savings of his former honest&#xD;
occupation. His whiskers curl beautifully; his mustaches are as fierce as an Arab's, and he wears&#xD;
a most aristocratic suit of clothes. What has he next to do ? Select a room at Delmonico's for&#xD;
three dollars a week, for he is aware that he will soon be invited to dine out, or can spunge a meal'&#xD;
when he gets a drink at luncheon time. He has in' his pocket a list of the names of our most&#xD;
wealthy merchants and brokers, and the age, number, and names-of their marriageable daughters.&#xD;
All that he hasnow to do is easy.  A few dollars spent among a certain class of young&#xD;
men in this town, or even a dinner, will procure any stranger an introduction into any&#xD;
one of the upper crust families in .town. Money paid to the class we allude to is certain&#xD;
to fetch them.  We allude to i broken down set of young men who are floating about&#xD;
town, livingupon their wits, or having a very small income frem the wieck of the estate of some&#xD;
old and respected family of other days. They have the entri to any society where they choose to&#xD;
go; they have spent fortunes in their day-been the darling young men of New York, lived high.&#xD;
and wasted their substance, and a foreigner who can afford to pay anyone individual of this class&#xD;
can go wherever he lists, and they all endorse him as anybody he chooses to be, from a count to a&#xD;
duke. These are the degenerate bloods to the manor born.&#xD;
As soon as the foreign -valet is introduced and made at home in one codfish family in New York,&#xD;
his way is clear before him, and his genius can have full and fair play. Mrs. Penny will make&#xD;
'an easy time ofeit for him. She prides herself upon the quantity of distinguished foreigners that&#xD;
she can carry about with her. She is delighted to introduce Count Valet anywhere, and to be his&#xD;
confidential friend, and the ci-devant barber of course is delighted to go there. Mrs. Penny&#xD;
vouches for everything the Couht Valet chooses to assert or insinuate, and she presents him at the&#xD;
residence of Mrs. Halfpenny, and every other lady of the copper families with whom she is on inti-&#xD;
mate terms, and while under her wing Count Valet may assert that he owns half Europe, and Mrs.&#xD;
Penny will swear to it, and whisper quietly that she knows all about him, because he does business&#xD;
with her merchant husband, and has several thousands of dollars, and any quantity of letters of&#xD;
credit lying idle in the hands of her husband's commercial firm, and she can for the time being&#xD;
honestly believe any story the Count Valet may choose.to tell her, and repeats it verbatim to all her&#xD;
friends and neighbors.&#xD;
Baron, Count, or Prince, she supports and maintains his claims to any or all of them. Her&#xD;
husband may not exactly like such management, but what on earth has a business man got to do&#xD;
with his wife's private associations. Let him attend to his business. Her's is to provide suitable&#xD;
associations for her family, and proper husbands for her unmarried daughters. But the Count is&#xD;
not idle all this time. By no manner of means. He is about and makes the most of his time-&#xD;
"makes hay while the sun shines." He proves himself to be a gentleman in a variety of ways-&#xD;
has the air, the manner and the unsophisticated ease, the language and information which a refined&#xD;
and polished man of the world is supposed to possess. Wretched English covers and hides down.&#xD;
right ignorance and vulgarity. To be near him at the piano and be accompanied by him on the&#xD;
guitar, and with his sweet voice, is the highest ambition of some fair girl who has money, and&#xD;
that he has fastened upon. She forgets the fact, or never knew it, thatto sing divinely and play&#xD;
the guitar admirably, is tnore an accomplishment of an Italian barber, a German valet or French&#xD;
hairdresser, than it is of a well-bred real European nobleman.&#xD;
Many of thega adventurers are successful in their demonstrations upon the weak points of our&#xD;
wealthy class. They succeed in their designs and unfortunately to often become the husbands&#xD;
of some of our most lovely belles, ride in their carriages, or take ttieir brides abroad on papa's&#xD;
money, to see the castles (?) of their lords of husbands in foreign lands. Many are established in&#xD;

CHAPTER X&#xD;
CONTENTS--Colonel Vanderhoost otill-continues to devise ways and means to advance the interest of Clarence-His visib&#xD;
to Mr. Gould, to whom lhe makes eiclosures of an astonishing character.&#xD;
UST and generous hearted as Colonel Vander-&#xD;
hoost was known to be by all who were intimate-&#xD;
ly acquainted with him, yet he was in some&#xD;
respects a selfi-h man of the world. He had lived&#xD;
long in New York, and watched carefully the&#xD;
motives of human action. He had not confined&#xD;
his observations solely to one sphere of life. He&#xD;
had made them among all classes. He knew full&#xD;
well that the facts related in our last chapter&#xD;
-_              were matters of every day occurrence in fashion-&#xD;
-__~-~_          able, wealthy life; such as we have in New York.&#xD;
He knew the secret springs that operated on the&#xD;
minds of the men of this class, and he kne w when&#xD;
and hoVto touch those springs when he had any&#xD;
design of his own to accomplish. For reasons&#xD;
-             that will be developed, as we carry our readers&#xD;
along, the colonel had determined to play upon&#xD;
and use his power in the case of the rich broker,&#xD;
Mr, Gould, for the especial benefit of our friend&#xD;
Clarence. He was well aware that wealth could&#xD;
always command genius and talent. The colonel knew it was wrong, and that such a state of&#xD;
things ought not to exist in a Christian community; yet it was, so, and therefore the colonel felt&#xD;
no conscientious scruples inadoting particular measures in some cases which would turn the&#xD;
tables and enable talent to use wealth. With him it was a legitimate business. He was poor.&#xD;
He felt that a man who posessed that wealth of which he had been deprived could be of the most&#xD;
essential service to his young friend Clarence, and he had willed that Mr. Gould should be the&#xD;
man. He had read Clarence at a glance, as if he had been an open printed book. He had learned&#xD;
from one act that he was brave,, generous, and unselfish; he saw at their first interview that he&#xD;
possessed, in an eminent degree, genius, ambition, commanding talent, and a lofty high toned&#xD;
mind, and that there was,nothing low or grovelling in his 'composition. These gifts, great and&#xD;
glorious as they were, he knew that they would never commend themselves to such a man as a&#xD;
'Wall street broker, unless they were associated with other adjuncts which would fasten upon the&#xD;
leak points of that broker's character. He knew what motives would ~operate in that quarter to&#xD;
make a firm And lasting friend of Mr. Gould for Clarence ) He felt that they would be gross, but&#xD;
not too strangely so, for the greedy and ignorant Gould. How correct the colonel had estimated&#xD;
the character of the broker, we shall now proceed td show in the most satisfactory manner.&#xD;
Colonel Vanderhoost was one of those inen whose veracity could not be called in question with&#xD;
impunity. He never told a lie in his life, and any white man who ever insinuated anything of the&#xD;
kind, either directly or indirectly, would have picked.up a fighi, perhaps, to a dead certaint, for&#xD;
the colonel would fight, and he was a crack shot.'. Besides this, when tbe colonel did tell a story&#xD;
which bordered on,the improbable, he was too intelligent to leave any trail to such stories. Ile&#xD;
was of a class of fibbers that are never " caught in the act." Besides he had his position to fall&#xD;
back upon, and he made a bold stand upon his dignity and reputation whenever he asserted or&#xD;
intimated anything which he wished to be believed. He neyer made the blunder to be precise in&#xD;
regard to names, dates, or places.&#xD;
Previous to his dinner with Clarence at Delmonico's, and after he had left that young gentle-&#xD;
man upon the occasion of his first interview with him upon the Battery, he pursued his way to&#xD;
the residence of M.r. Gould. When he reached the door, rang the bell, and a servant had an-&#xD;
swered it, he gave him his card, and told the man to give it to Mr. Gould', whom he knew was at&#xD;
h( me ttt that hour, and the colonel walked into the parlor, Hie did not remain long there, when&#xD;
ho received a message to come o~p stairs. He complied, and found Mr. Gould in his library,&#xD;
which consisted of a largE number of splendidly bound volumes of books. As he entered, the&#xD;
broker rose from his seat, dropped the evening ne wspaper which he was reading, and expressed&#xD;
&#xD;
his gratiflation at seeing the colonel, and asked, "What is stirring on the outside ?" The colonel&#xD;
knew his man, and with a very dignified manner, replied, "Really, sir- I do not know what you&#xD;
call the outside. , If you mean one of your flash broker tvrms, what is doing in the street ? alit&#xD;
have to say is, that I don't know anything about street transactions, nor do I wish to. I should&#xD;
not have called on you to-day, had it not been that I have heard, and have good reason to believe&#xD;
that you have been making a most consummate ass of yourself on a recent oecasion, ard as I am&#xD;
somewhat interested in your reputation, you having, been honored by being permitted to marry&#xD;
my sister, I want to know what it's all about ?-to sty the least, you have committed, a most un-&#xD;
pardonable breach of etiquette-have made a gross mistake, and been doing a very foolish thing&#xD;
Now I have come to have a personal interview swith- you to talk over the matter, and unless I&#xD;
have been greatly deceived in your character, when I convince you.that you have been doing.&#xD;
wrong, you will make-an apology. to the party aggrieved, make it all right, and continue to be&#xD;
worthy of my fiendship&#xD;
&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;
The grave manner in wnich the stazety Colohel pronounced all this, alarmed the broker, and he&#xD;
hastily broke out with-&#xD;
"Why, Colonel, what the deuce is the matter; what's dut? Has anything breke ?&#xD;
"Broke, indeed! you 'may well say that. By the bye, if you don't have a care, if there&#xD;
ain't anybody broke, there soon will be. Gould, you have a pair of daughters, that have the im-&#xD;
pudence sometimes to address me as their uncle, which by the way is also a very vulgar mode&#xD;
of. expression, as uncles in these days are generally supposed to be Ohatham street pawn-&#xD;
brokers."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, Colonel;. but about my daughters, surely no accident has happened to them ?"&#xD;
Not to them, but to one of them., You have one daughter."&#xD;
Yes, and one more which makes two."&#xD;
"Gould, don't be facetious, or attempt one of your arithmetical puns; they don't suit you. I&#xD;
speak of your oldest daughter; you have'one."&#xD;
"Yes, I have one olderthan the other, I suppose-"&#xD;
"Well, her name is Fanny; and if I am correctly informed, she-came very near being drowned&#xD;
.4uite recently."&#xD;
" That is so; but a miss is as good as a mile, you know, and the Miss wasn't drowned."&#xD;
PC Gould, did ydu intend that?  t' not a miss. Rather good for a broker to perpetrate. Tz&#xD;
go on about Fasny."&#xD;

"She fell in the water, but got out again, and is alive and kicking as usual."&#xD;
"And to whom, Mr. Gould, are you indebted for that happy circumstance, that she's alive and&#xD;
kicking now, as you elegantly express yourself ?"&#xD;
"Why, there was a young'chap that jumped off the ferry boat after her, and took a .wim to&#xD;
Governor's Island with her."&#xD;
"And pray what reward have you given him for saving little Fan 's life ?"&#xD;
"None at all. I offered him fifty cents for his trouble, and he insulted me by throwing it down&#xD;
on the Castle Gardei bridge."-           ,&#xD;
"Served you right; what business had you to insult him after he had rendered you such a ser-&#xD;
vice, by offering him such a paltry compensation. Upon my soul, I am ashamed for. you., But'&#xD;
Who is the chap as you call him?"&#xD;
"Oh, he is a noboly--a ship carpenter's son, or some other low person, "in one of the up town&#xD;
Wards. But don't look so alarmed, Colonel; I made her drop his acquaintance. Ile will probably&#xD;
never see her again."&#xD;
" That is not what is passing in my mind. Now, Gould, I'll tell you that you have made a great&#xD;
mistake in this business.  Do you believe inlrewards and punishments? Do you ever go to&#xD;
church ?"&#xD;
"To be sure I do. I have a pew in Grace. ChurAh.".&#xD;
"Well, never mind that now. Have you the least idea of. who that young man really is that&#xD;
rescued your eldest daughter from a watery grave ?"&#xD;
"On my soul I haven't, except that he is-"&#xD;
"Don't swear, Gould  It is a bad practice-a most ungentlemanly habit, and no man in pol-&#xD;
ished society, such as you are desirous to shine in, ever swears. You don't know who that&#xD;
young man is, and yet you treat him as though he was a dog. Speaking of dogs, are you aware&#xD;
that the young man's dog is one of the most extraordinary specimens of that sagacious animal ?"&#xD;
"No, I did not notice anything about the dog, except that he was a capital swimmer, and I&#xD;
wondered where he learned to swim."&#xD;
" Gould, did not that fact, that the dog could swim satisfy you that the dog was a very remark.&#xD;
able one ?"&#xD;
" Well, I must say it did. What's the dog's name ?"&#xD;
"Beppo. What a fortunate thing it is for you that I feel so deeply interested in your fate.as to&#xD;
have looked into the matter, and ascertained all about what you have overlooked. Are the doors&#xD;
,closed ?- gan no one overhear us ?"&#xD;
"No, we are all alone. Go ahead; what is all this about ?"&#xD;
"Mum's the word, you have done wrong-committed a great oversight, to say the least of it-&#xD;
destroydd our-no, I won't say that yet. Now, Gould, I will tell you in confidence who that&#xD;
young lad really is that, in all human probability, saved your child's life. He is-"&#xD;
"Go on; who is he ?'&#xD;
"Are-you quite sure no one is listening ?"&#xD;
"Nobody, of course not. Who is he ?"&#xD;
"He is the son-"&#xD;
" Well ?"&#xD;
"Close that window ;, some one might be passing along the street and overhear me."&#xD;
"There now, say on  The window is closed, and no one can overhear you. In the name of all&#xD;
the saints, whose son is he ?"&#xD;
" He is the son of his parents."&#xD;
"Of course he is. Who the -  doubts that? Whose else's son should he be ?"&#xD;
"Gould, you are a blasphemer. Now listen quietly, and don't allow yourself to get so excited.&#xD;
The name of that boy is Boltofi, Clarence Bolton; have you ever heard of that name before ?"&#xD;
"Never, until Fanny mentioned it to me."  ,V&#xD;
"Well, sir, Clarence has ancestors-old, ancient as the hills, castles, coats of mail, saddle$,&#xD;
bridles, harness, battle-axes, and all them old dodges, and there is noble blood in his veins."&#xD;
" Colonel, ain't you joking ? Do you know that fact ?"&#xD;
" Joke ? I never joke on family matters. His mothet-"&#xD;
" Yes ?"&#xD;
" Was a woman."&#xD;
" Yes, go on."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And her ancestors were-"&#xD;
"I am listening."&#xD;
"Gould, did you ever hear of Francois Premier ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I have. My old friend Depau named a ship after him. She isin the Havre line of pack-&#xD;
ets -good freights."&#xD;
"True, he did so. That shows he was somebody, for he was once a king of Frpnce.- Ask old&#xD;
Depau if h~e wasn't? Francois had a sister. She left France, went to St. Domingo, got married&#xD;
there. The mother of Clarence carpe from that island. She is a lineal descendant. - She' is one&#xD;
of the Premier family."&#xD;
"No, you don't tell me that! What a blamed shame she should have thrown herself away,&#xD;
and got married to a ship carpenter ?"&#xD;
" Hold on a minute. Not so fast. Who do you call a ship carpenter? Now, r emember, Gould,&#xD;
this conversation is to be strictly private, and never to be bientioned."&#xD;
",Of course. I understand you. It shall be considered confidential."&#xD;
"You won't mention it to your wife ever ?"&#xD;
"Certainly not."&#xD;
"Now, Gould, are you at all posted up in English history ? Do you know the names of the&#xD;
leading English houses ?"&#xD;
4 Of course I do. My firm are the banking agents for several leading English houses-, and I&#xD;
know all about them. If they ain't respectable, I'd like to be told who is, in the London market&#xD;
especially."&#xD;
" True, I see you.are up to what I am telling you. Do you recollect about what time William&#xD;
the Norman invaded England ?"                                                         *&#xD;
"No, not exactly. I suppose it must have been some time ago, for I don't remember the par-&#xD;
ticulars."-&#xD;
"I dare say you do not, If you want&#xD;
information on that point, I can give you&#xD;
the name of a nan that you believe in.&#xD;
You have a pew in that little building, up&#xD;
at the corner of Broadway and Rector&#xD;
street, known as Grace Church."&#xD;
" Yes, and it's the best church in this&#xD;
town."&#xD;
"That is to say, it's the most aristocra-&#xD;
tic and fashionable 'in town,. which suits&#xD;
your religious views remarkably well.&#xD;
However, it's Episcopal, has a very clever&#xD;
rector in the person of Dr. W., and I sup-e&#xD;
pose, before long, when property rises in.&#xD;
the lower part of the city it will be sold,&#xD;
the congregation remove up town and erect a&#xD;
a church, which shall take down old Trin-&#xD;
ity.&#xD;
" Colonel, I think you have hit the mark. It is a miserable little place for a wealthy and fash-&#xD;
ionable congregation, to meet in now, but wait until -we get a new one and tear down the present&#xD;
one. It will be a capital site for a store, but never mind Grace church, go on with what you&#xD;
were saying about Clarence Bolton."&#xD;
Let me see, where did I leave off; oh, I recollect, we were talking about the time William the,&#xD;
Conqueror invaded England. At that time, whenever it was, or soon afterwards' there was an&#xD;
Earl or Duke of the name of Bolton old as the hills. This Bolton is a liheal descendant from that&#xD;
family, which has became extinct in England."&#xD;
" Is it possible ! Why, Colonel, you astonish me. But then, how come he to be a ship carpenter ?"&#xD;
"I'll explain all that. One of the family left England after the discovery of America for some&#xD;
high crime or other, came over to this continent, landed at Plymouth rock or somewhere else, and&#xD;
had with him a green bag, in which was a horse shoe tied to a prophecy, which said chat one of the&#xD;
Boltons should be a ship carpenter, have a son, who should own a large Newfoundland dog, and&#xD;
that son should come to his own again. Now they are'a11 dead except this 1-ad, and even he don't&#xD;

&#xD;
know what great prospects are in store for him. Don't you see it all now? The green-bag is still&#xD;
retained, And is theonly relic except the horse shoe and the prophecy left, and I know where they&#xD;
are, although the lad and his mother don't know anything about them, and I don't intend they&#xD;
shall at present."&#xD;
"You are right, Colonel. What a fool I. have been to be sure. But are you sure the boy or his&#xD;
mother don't kgow any thing about it ?"&#xD;
"Quite sur, I assure you. The income of that estate must be worth at least 100,000 pounds&#xD;
sterling per annum, and then the title ?"&#xD;
"True, true  One hundred thousand pounds'sterling !"&#xD;
"'Yes, say, 444,444 44 dollars per annum, Mr. Gould, think of that."-&#xD;
"It's more than that, at the present rate of exchange. I'll give 9 1-2 per cent premium for good-&#xD;
sterling bills to-day."&#xD;
"Now, Gould, keep our secret. Don't lisp the matter, or people will laugh at us. Get young&#xD;
Bolton's confidence ; be his friend-marry him to Fanny one of those days; but keep mum. You&#xD;
understand ?"&#xD;
"4Don't I ? But I say, Colonel, I have treated him rather shabbily. What will he think of me&#xD;
after what has passed.?"&#xD;
"Kindness, a regular system of courtesy, and apparent interest and sympathy in all his pur-&#xD;
suits, will work thit. I'll bring him here any time you will say the word."&#xD;
"Do it at once, Colonel; say to-morrow, and do you tell iim__"&#xD;
"Stop, Gould; I will tell him nothing. Leave that to me. Have a good dinner on your table&#xD;
to-morrow."&#xD;
"Precisely at four, Colonel; don't forget."&#xD;
'I won't. By the way, you must do something for that dog. Buy him."&#xD;
"Buy the dog   Why, I don't want a dog, and perhaps he won't sell him."&#xD;
"I dare say not. I will arrange that, however; but it is a ticklish subject, and mustbe han-&#xD;
dled delicately., I will persuade him to give the dog to Fanny, and do you refuse do let her re-&#xD;
ceive him, unless the heir of the Boltons will accept a check for $500."&#xD;
"I'll do it. Get him to give Fan. the dog. I'll give him the money."&#xD;
' Now, Gould, keep quiet and prudent. Take your own course, but don't breathe a word of&#xD;
what has passed to a living soul; and now good-bye."&#xD;
After this conversation, the Colonel felt easy. He had achieved his object. The end justified&#xD;
the means. Henceforth his clever protege would find a wealthy and influential friend, ready to&#xD;
aid him in any emergency. It was after this conference he met Clarence at Delmonico's, and our&#xD;
readers know what passed.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER      X1.&#xD;
CONTENTS-The dinner at Mr. Gould'e--1lrence Boltonthe lion, &amp;amp;00, &amp;amp;o.&#xD;
-           EEPING in view the object of Colonel Vander.&#xD;
hoost, Clarence sauntered leisurely along until&#xD;
lie reached the splendid residence of the rich&#xD;
broker, Mr. Gould. When he reached the door,&#xD;
it was exactly half -past four, by old Trinity&#xD;
clock, which was in full view from the steps of&#xD;
Mr. Gould's house. Clarence was in no pleasant&#xD;
state of mind when he rang the bell. He was&#xD;
not particularly calm or collected. It was the&#xD;
first time he had ever dined out with a family.&#xD;
Then again all the queer circumstances connected&#xD;
with his becoming acquainted with the Gould&#xD;
family, came rushing into his mind, and he felt&#xD;
excessively shy and uneasy. As the servant came&#xD;
to the door, Claren-edemanded if Mr. Gould was&#xD;
at home. He was answered in the affirmative,&#xD;
and shown into the parlor. - Mr. Gould rose to&#xD;
receive him, and in a style that made Clarence&#xD;
really like the man, introduced him to his wife,&#xD;
children, and some other persons present.&#xD;
"You are very late, Mr. Bolton," remarked the broker; "we have kept dinner waiting for&#xD;
you nearly an hour."&#xD;
" Really, I am annoyed at that; for to tell you the truth, I camevery near forgetting my en-&#xD;
gagement to Colonel Vanderhoost; but luckily I temelubered it in time to be here. By the wa,&#xD;
Colonel, how do you do? I had not noticed before that you were in the room. You see that I have&#xD;
kept my promise."-&#xD;
The Colonel had been partly concealed when Clarence entered, and was holding a talk with&#xD;
Fanny in a corner of the room. He' now rose, extended his hand in reply to the salutation of&#xD;
Clarence, and with a curious expression in his eyes, which was not-unnoticed by Clarence, said:&#xD;
"My-dear boy, I see you have, and well too. * How is that excellent'lady, your good mother ?"&#xD;
"She was well' Colonel, when I left home this morning."&#xD;
"A lady-sister mine," continued the Colonel, addressing Mrs. Gould, " to whom I should like&#xD;
very much to introduce you."&#xD;
"I should be most happy to become acquainted with her," replied Mrs. Gould.&#xD;
"My mother, madam, is some what singular in that respect. . She rarely makes any new ac-&#xD;
quaintances; and would scarcely consent to doing so, except under very pressing circumstances."&#xD;
Mr. Gould was a listener, dd was not at all surprised at the remark of Olarence. He expected&#xD;
it, and it had the effect Ufnfirming, to a certain extent, the story of Colonel Vanderhoost about&#xD;
the Premier family. Mrs. Bolton, the mother of Clarence, was somebody. He felt sure of it.&#xD;
His reflections were cut short by the Colonel, who exclaimed:&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Gould, I must try my power of persuasion with Mrs. Bolton, and get her permission&#xD;
to take my sister up there and get the two ladies acquainted. I amsure they will like each other&#xD;
very much,; but meanwhile your dinner must be getting cold. Come, Mrs. G., shall I escort you&#xD;
to the dining room ?"&#xD;
The invitation was-accepted, and the hostess and the. Colonel led the way. Clarence escorted&#xD;
Fanny, and the rest of the party paired off and followedsto the dining room, where a sumptuous&#xD;
dinner awaited them. When Clarence and Fanny reached the table, she took a seat on one side of&#xD;
her father, and Clarence took a seat next to her. Mr. Gould sat at one end of the table,. and his&#xD;
wife at the other; the Colonel was seated at her right, and next to him was his youngest niece.&#xD;
There was an old merchant with his wife and daughter present ; the latter was a very pretty girl,&#xD;
with long; auburn ringlets, and great blue eyes. She was about the same age as Clarence. Au&#xD;
officer in the navy sat by her dide ; and then there were a few ladies, mothers, aunts, &amp;amp;c., whom&#xD;
Clarence supposed to be family fixtures, for' they rarely spoke. .After the dinner party were Coin.&#xD;

CLARENCE BOLTON.                                                                    A    C&#xD;
&#xD;
fortably seated at the table, Clarence waited for Mr Gould to ask a blsssing. His mother always&#xD;
did it; but the broker was not the man to waste his time. He was not a grace saying man, though&#xD;
he owned a pew in Grace Church. Soup was served, and devoured without any talk; that finish-&#xD;
ed, the pnain dinner was served up, and then Mr. Gould began to talk to Clarence. He asked him&#xD;
several questions, and received suitable replies. The conversation soon became general, and Clar-&#xD;
once had an opportunity to hold a very low'talk with Fanny.&#xD;
"How glad, Clarence, I am to see you!" said Fanny.&#xD;
"And I," replied the youth, "am very glad to be here. But did you know I was to dine here&#xD;
to-day-?"&#xD;
"Yes, papa told me so this morning; and charged me to behave very pretty, and all that. I&#xD;
never was so much astonished in my life. What has made him change his mind? I did not think&#xD;
he liked you, or would ever invite you here."&#xD;
"I suppose, Fanny, I am indebted to your uncle for this privilege."&#xD;
"I am quite sure he has had something to do with it,; for he -was here the other day, and he and&#xD;
pa had a long conversation in the library about something in particular. I dare say it was about&#xD;
you; but I don't care what it was about.- I am glad to see you here. I am sure mother willlike&#xD;
you, and then we will have such nice times of it! I have got such a lot of nice things, to show you&#xD;
when dinner is over."&#xD;
Then Fanny rattled on about college studies; his books, and asked a hundred questions in respect&#xD;
to the difference between the studies of younggentlemen and young ladies,'until Mr. Gould inter-&#xD;
rupted her nudertone conversation with Clarence, by asking the latter if he should have the&#xD;
pleasure of taking   glass of wine with him.  Clarence was at fault; but others were included in&#xD;
the invitation, and he did as they did, replying-.&#xD;
"With pleasure, sir."&#xD;
-A-&#xD;
-   - - ZN&#xD;
---l&#xD;
When Clarence filled, his glass from a decanter near, him, he' filled Fanny's glass at the same time.&#xD;

&#xD;
Up to this time, not the most distant allusion had been made by any of the parties at the din-&#xD;
ner table to the ferry- boat scene. The Colonel had not said a word about it; but he was watching&#xD;
carefully for a favorable opportunity to introduce the subject, and to properly define the position&#xD;
of Clarence to all the party present. Clarence continued his chat with Fanny, and the conversa-&#xD;
tion wandered up into the old Eleventh Ward, when he gave her an invitation to pay his excellent&#xD;
mother a visit. Fanny replied that sh'e could not tell whether her mother would let her go. Mr.&#xD;
Gould overheard this part of the conversation, and settled the matter by saying that Fanny and&#xD;
her sister might go any day that Clarence would call for them. It is strange, but even this&#xD;
prompt concurrence in the wish of Clarence by Mr. Gould, convinced the former that the broker&#xD;
had a great many good points in his character, and that he had not estimated him at his true value&#xD;
when they first met. He thanked the broker most cordially for the permission he had given-to&#xD;
Fanny. Colonel Vanderhoost now discovered that the favorable opportunity y had arrived for di-&#xD;
recting the attention of the company to his protege, and he remarked in a Idud tone to Mr. Gould:&#xD;
"Who, my dear sir, wouldimagine on looking at these two young people, yonder, who are chat-&#xD;
ting so quietly and cosily, that only aew days since they were both exposed to the very shocking&#xD;
death of drowning, in the North River, and that the young lady would inevitably met that rate,&#xD;
but for the manly courage and gallantry of that youth, assisted by a famous Newfoundland dog ?"&#xD;
Clarence blushed, but conversed more earnestly-with Fanny. As several of the parties present&#xD;
had not heard of the transaction, the Colonel of course was called.upon for an explanation, which&#xD;
he gave in full, by relating the whole story, and he did it in such a manner, as to call forth from&#xD;
all parties present one voice of admiration and praise. It was decided at once that Clarence was&#xD;
an unheard of hero, and that no gratitude whatever could repay him for saving the life of Miss&#xD;
Fanny. Even the ringlets and blue eyes were turned admiringly upon the handsome, intellectual&#xD;
face of Clarence, the young lady that owned them immediately determined to cultivate the ac-&#xD;
quaintance of so good a swimmer, and regretted exceedingly. that she was not the rescued young&#xD;
lady: for it would have been the sort of romance she could have luxuriated in, and Clarence was&#xD;
just the sort of person that she could have fell desperately in love with and have enjoyed the fun&#xD;
of it amazingly.&#xD;
We have thus far said very little of Mrs. Gould, the sister of Colonel Vanderhoost, and we will&#xD;
do full justice to her character. She was a woman that possessed the warmest feelings of a kind&#xD;
hearted mother. She had never known what love really was. She married Mr. G6uld because he&#xD;
had money, and was a rising man in this community. She was comparatively poor, and so was&#xD;
her brother. All of her friends told her that it *ould be an excellent.match, so she followed theii&#xD;
advice and married the money, though she disliked the man. She had never possessed any extra-&#xD;
ordinary claims to beauty. As we have said before, she was of good blood. When she married she&#xD;
was short, plump, rather pretty features, and her ideas were not very extended. She was rather&#xD;
indifferent to her fate. When children began to gather around her, she became a very different&#xD;
being. She was still heartliss, proud and overbearing in general; but where they were concerned,&#xD;
she felt and acted as a mother. - No sooner had her brother finished his eulogy on the exploits of&#xD;
Clarence in the water and the guests had become quiet, than she took up the themoe, and addressed&#xD;
Clarence in language that went to his heart, astonished every one at the table, except her brother,&#xD;
and even he was surprised to find more of the mother in his sister, than he had ever given her&#xD;
credit of possessing.&#xD;
" Clarence, thisis the first opportunity I have had to tell you how very grateful I feel for your&#xD;
brave conduct, in going to the assistance of my darling little Fanny, the day she fell overboard&#xD;
from the ferry. boat. I am very grateful  I can't call you Mr. Bolton; I must call you Clarence,&#xD;
and must regard you almost as dear as if you were one of my own children. T3ut for your timely&#xD;
aid, I should now have been mourning for one of mine. I hope you will ever retard my home as&#xD;
your home, feel that I am a mother, and will be one to you if I can. My brother has spoken to me&#xD;
of your mother. From what you have said, I am not certain that she will receive me if I visit&#xD;
her ; but to-morrow I shall call on her, and thank her for being the mother of a brave boy, who&#xD;
has saved the life of one of my children. -Comne, ladies, we will leave the gentlemen ; they want&#xD;
to finish their wine and smoke their cigars by themselves. Come, my daughters. Clarence, before.&#xD;
you leave for home, I want to speak with you." ,-&#xD;
The ladies followed the hostess from the dining room,; the gentlemen, who had risen when they&#xD;
took their departure, resumed their seats at the table. Mr. Gould was delighted at what his wife~&#xD;
had said to Clarence. He had not let hei' into his secret, and he felt as though she could not hatr~*&#xD;

done the thing, vs he called it, in a more handsome style, even if she had known all that he sup.&#xD;
posed he himself knew about the young lad.&#xD;
"Capital,.1by Jove !" he exclaimed. "Well, Clarence, how do you like your new mother, eh?&#xD;
Come, gentlemen, fill your glasses all around; I have got a sentiment to propose on this occasion.&#xD;
Here is the health of Beppo, the Newfoundland dog, and his young master, Clareice."&#xD;
All of the party drank the toast except Clarence. He replied to it very briefly by stating that&#xD;
he felt highly honored, both on his own account, and on that of Beppo, who he regretted was not&#xD;
present to wag his tail and bark a reply in person. "As he is not," continued Clarence, "I thank&#xD;
you for doing justice to the absent; if you will permit me to offer a sentiment I will say no more."&#xD;
".d Mother, first to love us, may the be the last toforget her."&#xD;
"(Bravo, excellent !" exclaimed Colonel Vanderhoost, and the noble sentiment was drank in&#xD;
bumpers.&#xD;
Mr. Gould's wine cellar was well stocked. He had the choicest of all the kinds tliat the vine&#xD;
ever produced, and for this he was solely indebted to.Colonel Vanderhoost, who, as a matter of&#xD;
course. knew every bottle that the broker had in his cellar.&#xD;
"Come, Gould, after that sentiment, proposed by Clarence, send down stairs for a bottle of that&#xD;
famous crusted old port that you procured at the sale of wines, and let's do honor to this occasion.&#xD;
I want to propose your own'health."'&#xD;
It is needless to say, that the broker sent for the wine, and, as a matter of course, it was pro.&#xD;
nounced excellent, as it would have been, even if it-had been the famous imitation port made in&#xD;
Marseilles, so little do even real judges of, wines know about the purity or quality of wines, after&#xD;
their taste has been destroyed by drinking of different kinds. While this was passing, the Colonel&#xD;
who had removed his seat to that part of the table where Clarence was seated, whispered in his.&#xD;
ear, "Keep quiet, now, don't drink any more wine, and listen. You will hear some things I wish&#xD;
you to know," and then raising his voice, he addressed the old merchant; "Mr. Brand, I learn that&#xD;
you have been purchasing some property in Broad street very recently. Do you think it will rise&#xD;
in that quarter of the city ?"&#xD;
"No doubt about it, sir," replied the merchant. "Property will increase in value on any part&#xD;
of the island, but in some parts more rapidly than in others. It is my opinion that Broad street,&#xD;
which is destined to be a commercialstreet, will in a few years be filled with warehouses, instead&#xD;
of as now, with dwelling houses, that are shortly to be pulled down to make room for stores. New&#xD;
York will want every inch of room&#xD;
down town for commercial purpo.&#xD;
ses. The dwelling houses will go&#xD;
first, and then will follow the pub-&#xD;
lie places. There are several of&#xD;
these that must come down. The&#xD;
street1 they are located in will all&#xD;
be business streets. The GArden&#xD;
Street Church will go first; then&#xD;
Doctor Phillips' church, in Wall&#xD;
street, will go, and I should not&#xD;
be surprised if the church where&#xD;
I and my family worship should&#xD;
be torn down next."&#xD;
__     __                                           " You attend the Presbyterian&#xD;
church in Cedar street, that was&#xD;
so long under the charge of the&#xD;
--  -                       __     Reverend, Dr. Romeyn, do you&#xD;
not ?" interrupted the Colonel.&#xD;
" Yes. It is now under the&#xD;
JJLJLScharge of the Rev. Cyrus Mason;&#xD;
11 R nubut all that part of Cedar street,&#xD;
________    between Nassau and Broadway,&#xD;
will be occupied as stores before&#xD;
*long. What is the reason, Mr.&#xD;
'Gould, that you brokers don't go into real estate ? Other uses for your capital, I suppose."&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.                                    57&#xD;
" No, indeed, we can make a better interest by our own legitimate business It is all very well&#xD;
for men who have got no business in which to employ their capital usefully, to buy real estate and&#xD;
let it lie unproductive. I have no doubt it will pay a good interest in the end. I agree with you that&#xD;
Broad street property located this side of Beekman street must, will rise in value in a very few&#xD;
years, for it will be required for commerce, and it will pay a better interest than dwelling houses.&#xD;
Money invested in those will never pay over 6 per cent. on the market value of the property."&#xD;
" Really, gentleman ," remarked the Colonel, "what a very pleasant subject you have selected&#xD;
for conversation; upon my word, to a man situated like myself, who is without an extra copper,&#xD;
it is quite refreshing to hear you two wealthy men dilate learnedly upon the best method of in-&#xD;
vesting your surplus cash. Pray, can either of you rich people inform me how to make money ?"&#xD;
" It is very easy," replied old Brand, "but I must say, Gould, that I think you or any other&#xD;
rich man in this city very foolish to keep much of his capital in business. You ought always to&#xD;
invest a fair magin in real estate, and get rich in that way"&#xD;
" But, I tell you, Brand, real estate don't pay like a good business. When a man has acquired&#xD;
wealth by his business s, then let him retire and invest it in real estate, and not tillthen," said the&#xD;
broker&#xD;
"You are wrong, Gould, decidedly wrong, and so you will find. Now, just 1t me give you my&#xD;
own history. Many years ago, when I left clerking it, I had saved about.$800, and with that I&#xD;
engaged in the wholesale and retail grocery business. The very first year I cleared over $1,000&#xD;
profit. It cost me to live about $300. I added to my stock in trade about '$200 more, and I in-&#xD;
vested $500 in a purchase of property-real estate, which cost me $8,000. $2,500 of this amount.&#xD;
I left on mortgage, and with a few months of the subsequent profits of my business Ieasily raised&#xD;
that mortgage. Every year Iadded to my stock or capital invested in trade, only sufficient for&#xD;
my increase of business, but I always invested the main share of my profits in real estate. What&#xD;
has been the result? This property has increased enormously in value and-still continues to do&#xD;
so, and is*actually giving me a greater income per annum than my business ever did. You will&#xD;
findt it the safest plan in the long run to do as I did. I bought it. for $5,000; it has paid on this&#xD;
amount from 6 to 80 per cent. income for 15 years, and I could sell it to-morrow for $76,000.- What&#xD;
do you think of that ?"&#xD;
"There is some truth in what you say; but let every man attend to his own business. I had&#xD;
no more money when I. started than yourself; but I commenced buying short paper, sometimes at&#xD;
three per cent, a month discount, and kept turning it over and over, speculating in stocks and in&#xD;
foreign bills of exchange, until I find myself pretty well off, Brand--not rich; but with a snug&#xD;
little sum, and Iknow where it is. I could employ to advantage five millions in my business, if I&#xD;
had it. Why, friend Brand, I have made the credit of my house so good, that I can purchase good&#xD;
A No.. 1-bills of exchange to the extent of one hundred thousand dollars worth every paoket,and&#xD;
re-sell them to importing merchants atone per cent. more than I gave. People pay this to have&#xD;
our bills, or our endorsements, as so much safer than any others. Would I not be silly in&#xD;
investing funds which I can turn over to an unlimited extent, in real estate or any land specula-&#xD;
'tion ?"&#xD;
",Yet, Gould, you will find out that I am right, and that you are wrong in the long run. Tell&#xD;
me of any very rich man in this city, who has become rich lky his legitimate business alone ?&#xD;
There are none. If a merchant keeps his profits in his business, he is as certain to die a beggar,&#xD;
as a gambler would be, who had for a time a run of luck, and continued to double his stakes as&#xD;
fast as he made them. There must come a t yrn of luck, and then be is swept 6leat. You may,&#xD;
perhaps, be so unfortunate as to find it come true in your own career. You keep all your money&#xD;
invested in-your business. Bye and bye you will have a turn of luck. Bank and insurance com-&#xD;
panics may fail, fire, panic, or something else may overturn the mercantile firms of the commer-&#xD;
cial world. Where will you be then? Y,ou will have nothing to fall back upon. It won't do, I&#xD;
tell you. If a man is prosperous, making money by his business, and wants to get rich, let him&#xD;
invest from year~ to year two -thirds at least of his profits, inu productive real estate. He is then&#xD;
guarded against accidents, and will as assuredly getrich as that two and two make four.&#xD;
I.                               8&#xD;

acknowledge that you have placed things before&#xD;
~_   ~   my eyes in a different light from what I have&#xD;
been accustomed to regard them, When I re-&#xD;
-             fleot a moment, I am clearly convinced that you&#xD;
are right. It is an unquestioned fact that the&#xD;
failures of our merchants are caused by their&#xD;
- grasping avarice, greediness, and their want of&#xD;
prudence in not investing a share of their profits&#xD;
in a safe property. The gradual but sure rise of&#xD;
-. ---real estate in this city during a very few y ears,&#xD;
- will make any man who is an owner of it, im-&#xD;
mensely rich. , This is the true secret of the great&#xD;
wealth acquired by Astor, and he ner no other&#xD;
man who is immensely rich, ever became so from&#xD;
the profits of their legitimate business alone.&#xD;
-              But you have not yet answered my question, and&#xD;
informed me how a man without a capital can make money ?"&#xD;
"That is generally an impossibility. A man must have some capital, even if it is only a dollar;&#xD;
'but if he has that dollar unincumbered, and places it right, it will grow and make him rich&#xD;
in twenty or even ten years."&#xD;
" What? one do lar, Mr. Brand ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Colonel Vanderhoost, and I can easily explain it to you. But I first wish you to under-&#xD;
stand me: any man living can become rich, if his health is good for ten years, with one dollar in&#xD;
cash, or even credit,.to begin with. . He has only to forget all other objects, disregard everything&#xD;
else, and fix his whole soul in that on'e thing-the determination to become rich. Now, don't let&#xD;
me offend you, although you are a very proud man. Suppose you were to take this dollar, and&#xD;
proceed from this table now to Fulton Market; when you reach it, purchase a basket which will&#xD;
cost you two shillings or thirty-one and, a quarter cents. Having done so, you place it on your&#xD;
arm, and then go across to a stationery store, buy quills, wafers and pencils, to the extent of five&#xD;
shillings and six pence more; place the articles-in your basket, and then proceed'to Niblo's ilank&#xD;
Coffee House, where men congregate with whom yo4 are well acquainted. Convince the people&#xD;
there that you are in earnest, and how long do you suppose it would take you to sell out the.,con-&#xD;
tents of your basket at a profit of fifty or over one hundred per cent.? It would not occupy Jou&#xD;
half a day to do this. Mind you, all pride is to be laid aside. Very well; you have made I'will&#xD;
say thirty-five cents, cleared your basket of its contents, and cleared the basket by the profit. v&#xD;
This basket is paid for by your profits, and becomes stock. Suppose you continue this traic, and&#xD;
clear fifty cents every day for a week ?"&#xD;
"Yes, yes, Brand; but my expenses, tney have got to be paid out of this money. 'Where are&#xD;
they to come from ?"&#xD;
Ah, Colonel, now you shall have the great secret of how to become a rich man. You must not&#xD;
let your daily expenses amount to one half of your profits. If you make but twenty-five cents,&#xD;
spend but a shilling. Water costs nothing ; bread would cost you but six and a quarter cents per&#xD;
day, and you live like a prince on those two articles. You don't really need any more. You can&#xD;
get a good place to sleep in-for six and a quarter cents more, or a shilling at the most."&#xD;
"Stop, stop; that won't do. Get a room for a shilling ?"&#xD;
"Yes. Haveyou never been into one of the numerous lodging houses in town, where you can&#xD;
get a good bed for a shilling ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.                                   59&#xD;
"No I am happy to say that I have not. Do you pretend to say that there are any such&#xD;
places ;where a gentleman could go and sleep ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't know what a gentleman has got to do with it, There are quiet, respectable places in&#xD;
this town, where men-good, honest men-but who are poor, and obliged to economise; there, in&#xD;
a good sized room, with every comfort, and with perhaps two or three companions in the room,&#xD;
they can sleep as sound, if they have an easy conscience,) as if they were lodging at the best hotel&#xD;
in New York, and without losing their own self respect, or the respect of any one else. But to&#xD;
continue. At the end of a week, by adopting and acting up to the rule, you will find your capital&#xD;
increased by your increased business, purchases and sales, until at the end of a week you would&#xD;
have eight. or nine dollars. The same industry and compound increase for a month, would give&#xD;
you fifty dollars; and at the end of a year, you would find yourself in possession of a store with&#xD;
twelve hundred dollars stook in it. Now, all this is practical and easily demonstrated. The&#xD;
secret is in activity and economy. Your fortune is your savings at the start. You are to forget&#xD;
everihiMng else, do-nothing except to make money, and you must sacrifice every needless thing&#xD;
tthat. Do but this .for ten years, and you will find yourself worth fifty thousand dollars; so&#xD;
woul4a beggardthe carried out the idea, if he would be industrious, economical, and invest in&#xD;
productive property, only one half'would be able to beg. What'do you say, Mr. Gould, am I not&#xD;
right ?"&#xD;
"I have no doubt of it whatever ; for the moment any man, who made up his mind to adopt sich&#xD;
a course, had reaped the first fruits of it, he would naturally become the most perfect of misers, and&#xD;
be lost to every feeling of decency. But come, gentlemen, what say you, shall we adjourn to&#xD;
the ladies ? What do you say, Lieutenant ?"&#xD;
"Really, my dear sir,' I have listened with a great deal of attention to what Mr. Brand has&#xD;
said. Do you think, sir, that if I was to save half my pay and invest it as you say, that I aould&#xD;
make a fortune ?"&#xD;
'" Have no doubt about it," replied Mr. Brand. The Lieutenagt in after life followed the ad-&#xD;
vice, and now while we are writing this, he is a commander in the navy, a very rich man, and he&#xD;
got his-first lesson in the art of becoming so at that dinner table. He has since then made thou-&#xD;
sands by playing Shylock, advancing money to brytr offrsatnormo   erest, secured some-&#xD;
times by personal jewelry.&#xD;
. Colonel Vanderhoost now rose from his seat and said be must be going. Clarence requested him&#xD;
to remain a moment, and he would then accompany him, at the same time he requested a waiter&#xD;
to inform Mrs. Gould that he was about leaving. The 'servant delivered his message, and then&#xD;

returned with a message desiring Clarence to follow him. He did so, and found Mrs. Gould alone&#xD;
with Fanny. He was absent so long, that Colonel Vanderhoost began to be angry. When Clarence&#xD;
returned,, tears were standing in his eyes. The Colonel pretended not to perceive his emotion,&#xD;
and soon after they both bid Mr. Gould and his guests adieu, and left the dining room for the&#xD;
street. ,The Colonel spoke first:&#xD;
"Well, my boy, what do you think of the dinner party ?"&#xD;
"I was very much pleased, really Mr. Gould behaved-"&#xD;
"Oh. pshaw! the cop is all right-in fact- everything went off in the best manner possible.&#xD;
You are now A No. 1, as the broker would say, with all the family. Pray tell me, if there is no&#xD;
particular reason for secrecy, why my very worthy sister sent for yog, and what she said to you&#xD;
when she got you into her apartments ?"&#xD;
"True. I was absent some time, but she had a great deal to say to me. She asked me a great&#xD;
many questions. First, in reference to my own prospects-what I was going to do, and then&#xD;
about my mother, and'gave me a'very kind message to deliver to her."&#xD;
"What was the message ?"&#xD;
"She told me-to tell her that she would call there during the course of the week, which I said.I&#xD;
would cheerfully do. Then she kissed me on the forehead, and said she felt as though I was al-&#xD;
most as dear to her as any of her own children-wished they were like me in some respects, and&#xD;
then I came away."&#xD;
"Of course, and when you came away, Master Clarence, I suppose you kissed Fanny, too."&#xD;
"Well, I did; for she asked her mother if 'she might not be mysister, and when her mother&#xD;
said yes, she, kissed me. How could I avoid kissing my sister in return ?"&#xD;
"Oh, certainly. Sister, indeed! She will get bravely over that when she gets a little older,"&#xD;
said the Colonel, regarding Clarence in a very quizzical manner. "My boy, you are getting on&#xD;
rapidly, what did you do with yourself after I left you? By the way, don't you go to Delmonico's&#xD;
too often. Hundreds of young men are started on the road to ruin in just such fashionable places&#xD;
as that. However, we will go down there now; it's safe for you to do so if you go with me.. I&#xD;
want a glass of marachino and a cigar." When they reached Delmonico's and had seated them-&#xD;
selves at one of the little tables, the Colonel asked Clarence if he smoked?&#xD;
"No, sir, I do not."&#xD;
"Well, I don't know whether to advise you to learn or not. It is a very soothing recreation,&#xD;
and if a man has trouble, it aids him very materially to become a philosopher, that is, to take&#xD;
things coolly and as they come. Perhaps you had better learn to smoke, and quit the practice&#xD;
whenever you get married. -That is one of the indulgences of a bachelor, which he should part*&#xD;
with when he takes a wife. Clarence, I really feel for you, and as we have got a leisure hour, we&#xD;
will have another talk. It won't do you any harm. You are just on the eve of entering into the&#xD;
replities of a man's life. You want a pilot as badly as a good-sized ship that has to pass through&#xD;
Hellgate. I will take upon myself the responsibility of being your pilot. . You don't know your-&#xD;
self yet. You are like a young bear, all your troubles have yet to come. :You are blessed with a&#xD;
most excellent mother. You had a clever father, and I knew and liked him. You have got a col-&#xD;
legiate education. So had I. I had'money and rich connections. You have not got either. I&#xD;
missed the figure, and partly caved in., You shall not. Why? I had no pilot; I haa no expe-.&#xD;
rienced friend, who had been through the mill himself, to advise me in my boyish days. You are,&#xD;
more fortunate, and have got such an one. I am the man, or rather the gentleman, who will take&#xD;
charge of your education in the great school of the world. I have been all my life exchanging&#xD;
my diamonds for cops. I have got any quantity of cop acquaintances, but my diamonds, my trea-&#xD;
sures of sincerity, early ambition, my youth, my education, bright hopes, boyish dreams, love, in-&#xD;
nocence, ability, where are they? All gone; but no matter. It's a funny matter to think of, and&#xD;
when I do so, I despise the very means which were used to rob me of them. Clarence, you have&#xD;
diamonds-rich jewels thqy are, if you will only wear them rightly. Use the world, but don't&#xD;
permit the world to?.zse you; and then instead of being bankrupt in everything you have possessed&#xD;
or hoped for, when you reach fifty years of age, as I am, your ledger, as my worthy mercantile&#xD;
father used to say, will show a different and more profitable result than mine will exhibit to your&#xD;
balance sheet at the end of your fifty years. In your account with the great world, will exhibit the&#xD;
following state of affairs, and by the way I made it out last night," and here the Colonel took out -&#xD;
of his pocket-book, and handed to Clarence a piece of paper. " Read this," said he, " and impress&#xD;
it upon your memoryy" Clarence received the paper, and read as follows:-&#xD;

To complete success brought down to fifty years of age.&#xD;
" There you have it, Clarence. Now you understand what your balance may be when you&#xD;
reach the age of fifty, that I now wear. You will have attained succes', and that means every-&#xD;
thing in this world. You will be indebted tothe world for honor, fame, and all the other good&#xD;
things in life, and the world will have paid you, which it would not have done but for me. In ex-&#xD;
change, the world will he'e only taken from you your youth, innocence, and a few other trifles&#xD;
composing your early stock in trade, as I did. It would have robbed you of your own possessions,&#xD;
as it did me, and given you nothing back but bitter experience."&#xD;
Clarence was very much astonished, and he replied, "Colonel, I feel very much honored by&#xD;
your kindness, and I begin to comprehend you. Let me add one word-if you act my friend-if&#xD;
you do all this for me, and give me the benefit of your experience, and I realize how valuable it&#xD;
will be to me, what can I do in return for it? Will not my attachment, my friendship, gratitude,&#xD;
love, if you make me succeed, be sone slight gratification, and some repayment of what you your-&#xD;
self have suffered ?"&#xD;
"Yes, my boy, it will, indeed. Clarence, did you ever hate anybody ?"&#xD;
Clarence hesitated a moment, and then striking his clenched fist on the table, and with a fierce&#xD;
loQk he exclaimed-&#xD;
" Yes, with my whole heart."&#xD;
Even the Colonel was startled for a moment at the look of that boy, and quietly observed:&#xD;
"Indeed, Clarence, I believe you have; but why and who ?"&#xD;
"Old Wolf; and I'll have revenge too! Let me once get the power, and I'll give him a taste of&#xD;
suffering such as he never dreamed of."&#xD;
"Who, Clarence ?- Wolf ?" said the amazed Colonel. "Why, when did you know that old animal?&#xD;
What has he ever done to y'ou ?"&#xD;
Clarence buried his head in his hands for a few moments, and then made a clean breast of it,&#xD;
told his friend the Colonel the story of Mr. Wolf's infamous and base conduct to his mother in her&#xD;
hour of need, and closed his simple story by expressing his solemn determination to do two things:&#xD;
one was, to get into the Legislature when he became of age, and aid in erasing that infernal statute&#xD;
relating to imprisonment for debt from off the statute book; and the other was, never to rest until&#xD;
he had made old Wolf crouch before him, " for," added Clarence, " he made me and my mother,&#xD;
'before I was born, kneel to him to ask for the liberation of my father, and refused it."&#xD;
The Colonel was in ecostacies ; he was delighted; he could have hugged Clarence, but he didn't&#xD;
do anything of the kind; he simply remarked:&#xD;
 " I bve partially heard of all that before. You are right-you can hate. You see now -that&#xD;
money, power and influence are worth fighting for in the world, for. it is through their means&#xD;
onty that we can accomplish the favorite object of our hearts. Keep your own counsel.,. Never&#xD;
tell any one else what you have this night-told me. Advise with me in everything. As soon as&#xD;
you are clear of that College, I must find something for you to do to support yourself until you&#xD;
are of age. Do you remember what was said about making money at Mr. Gould's ?"&#xD;
"I did and it impressed itself upon my memory. Where does Mas Brand live, or where is his&#xD;
place of business ?"&#xD;
" In Broad street-that wide street where we were the other day, when you asked me what kind&#xD;
of a house that was with it's gable end facing the street ?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, I remember-the old Dutch house you called it."&#xD;
&#xD;

be allowed to stand long. It&#xD;

The two friends walked up,&#xD;
the street some distance to-&#xD;
gether, and then Clarence&#xD;
bade the Colonel good night,&#xD;
and went home to his mo-&#xD;
ther. It took him  a. long&#xD;
time to recount all the doings of the day, but as they were quite interesting he told her all&#xD;
and delivered the message of Mrs. Gould. The widow said but little. Then Clarefrce showed'her-&#xD;
the balance sheet of Colonel Vanderhoost, and told her what he had said. She was rejoiced to find"&#xD;
that her son had evidently formed a'sincere friendship with a man so iduch his senior, who under-'&#xD;
stood this wicked world so well, and estimated it and its population, particularly that portion in&#xD;
this city, at its real value. Ehe recommended Clarence to make an entry in his journal, before&#xD;
he went tQ bed, of all that he had gathered from the Colonel, then she left him to finish his college&#xD;
lessons went and to her own room.&#xD;

ANY of our readers are in the habit of sending&#xD;
notes to the Editor in reference to this story, and&#xD;
most strongly recommend the writer not to fol-&#xD;
low the usual course of a thorough -bred novel&#xD;
writer, and drive ahead with the plot as fast as&#xD;
possible, but to make that a secondary matter,&#xD;
and to indulge more in that style of writing&#xD;
which has become popular in the editorials of this&#xD;
paper. We are inclined to pursue the same idea&#xD;
suggested; in fact, we have done so thus far,&#xD;
and may be forced to do so until we get more&#xD;
leisure and find time to devote a succession of&#xD;
days to the completion of our tale. As it is, the&#xD;
editorials of the Picayune and a page of the story&#xD;
are written at the same. hour and on the same&#xD;
sheet of paper, and it is a rare matter to find a&#xD;
minute to devote to this story more than is re-&#xD;
quired for the particular number for which we&#xD;
are writing. This state of things gives our ar-&#xD;
tist no time or chance to make such drawings as&#xD;
would be desirable to illustrate; for we take up the last chapter, see what it contained, and con-&#xD;
tinue it until we get enough written to make another chapter, when our labor in the story line&#xD;
is at an end, and we can ply our pen at another portion of the paper.&#xD;
In the last chapter we left Clarence Bolton at home with his mother, after having dined with&#xD;
the rich broker, Mr. Gould. Several days elapsed after that dinner, but no particular matter&#xD;
occurred to interrupt him in the quiet and regular manner in which he pursued his studies. A&#xD;
week passed, and he had not heard a word from the Colonel. From some unexplained cause, Mrs.&#xD;
Gould had not called on his mother, as she had promised she would do on the day of the dinner.&#xD;
Clarence did not like this state of things, and wondered what had happened that the lady and&#xD;
Fanny had not called, or why the Colonel had not sent him a line to ask him what he was doing.&#xD;
On one occasion, when he was brooding over this disappointment at not hearing from the new&#xD;
friends that he was just beginning to love and feel interested in, he made up his mind not to think&#xD;
of them any more at all, and if there was to be any further intimacy, they must make the&#xD;
advances. The night had far advanced, and he had been engaged for hours upon his daily duty&#xD;
and studies. When they were satisfactorily finished, he took his seat by the window, and looked&#xD;
out upon the open land which surrounded his mother's residence, and watched the moonbeams&#xD;
playing upon the rippling waters of the East River; he felt then like taking, in the still hours of&#xD;
the night, when every thing about him was hushed and still, a careful reviewal of the events of the&#xD;
past few days, and a searching survey into the new prospects by which he apparently was sur-&#xD;
rounded. Since he had entered College he had begun to think and to act for himself, until his ac-&#xD;
cidental acquaintance with the Gould4amily, and his introduction to Colonel Vanderhoost. Since&#xD;
that event, and particularly since the dinner, he felt assured that, for good or evil, the Colonel&#xD;
was henceforth to exercise a powerful influence over his future destiny. ' He had assumed the po-&#xD;
sition of a friend and adviser, and Clarence had no disposition to deny it to him. He was grate-&#xD;
ful for kindness, and would not for worlds have regarded the Colonel in any other mauner than an&#xD;
old trustworthy acquaintance and friend. He had been the friend of the father of -Clarence, and&#xD;
at'a critical period in the affairs of his parents-why should he not prove equally se to the son ?&#xD;
Clarence had often thought over in his own mind what he shojild do when he graduated from Col-&#xD;
lege, but ever since he had met with the Colonel, he had given himself less concern about that&#xD;
matter, and had partly abandoned a half formed plan of studying a profession : he had determined$&#xD;
to be guided in a great measure by whatever plan the Colonel should suggest. Then he attempted&#xD;
to reason upon the very singular circumstance that a man so wealthy and prosperous as Mr.&#xD;
Gould, after having shown such a dislike to himself at the time he had saved the life of the rich&#xD;

man's daughter, should so suddenly change, and without any apparent cause, save the regard of&#xD;
his brother-in-law, extend his hand to invite him to dine at his house and visit in his family!&#xD;
which various surmises were actively being caressed in the mind of the unsophisticated boy, when&#xD;
his attention was directed to a singular appearance in the sky, just above the high land back of the&#xD;
Wallabout, on the 6ther side of the East River. He was not long in perceiving the cause. It was&#xD;
daybreaking, and the wearied scholar closed the window, fhing himself down upon his cot bed,&#xD;
and slept soundly until his mother came to his room and woke him to say that their breakfast was&#xD;
ready, and that ahe only waited-for her son.&#xD;
Clarence got up, dressed himself, hurried down stairs, called for Beppo, and both went to the&#xD;
river and took their morning bathe, where he met lots of Eleventh Ward boys of his acquaintance.&#xD;
By- seven o'clock he was ba again at his mother's house, and partaking with her of her morn -&#xD;
ing meal. The widow noticed the jaded look of her son, guessed'that he had had but little rest,&#xD;
and chided him for working so hard, and the more particularly, for sitting up so late in the night.&#xD;
He replied that he could not help it, and added:I&#xD;
"Never you mind, dear mother, have a little patience, it will all come out right bye and bye,&#xD;
and then I shall have more time to be with you and plenty of time to sleep. Only wait until I get&#xD;
through with my studies, and graduate."1&#xD;
"Ah, Clarence,I am very sorry that I ever permitted you to go to'College; it has been very&#xD;
expensive, and I do not know what you Will be able to do for a livelihood, after you leave it. We&#xD;
have got very little money left, and how we are to support ourselves until you get a profession; is&#xD;

" But you will like Mrs. Gould, I am sure; and Then Fanny, mother, what a nice little daugh-&#xD;
ter -in-law she would make, eh ?" Clarence was standing while addressing his mother this obsr-&#xD;
vation, and he had no sooner made it, than he noticed a look of anguish pass rapidly over her face,&#xD;
:nd he sidded "Why, my darling mother, what have I said to displease you ?"&#xD;
" Come and sit down by my side, Clarence; I have often wanted to talk to you on one particular&#xD;
subject, now that you are grown up to be almost a man." Clarence did as he was requested, held&#xD;
his mother's hand in his own, and looked enquiringly into her face, as if he would read what was&#xD;
passing there, while his mother continued:  I have never, my dear son, asked an important&#xD;
favor of you. You are my all. I have nothing in the wide world to love but you, and when you&#xD;
cease to love mother, she would not want to live longer."&#xD;
But mother, why do you say this-how can-I ever cease to love you to whom I owe every-&#xD;
hing ?"&#xD;
" Hush, my Clarence, and listen. When your father died, he left me only you. - I never had&#xD;
loved but him, and never could or have loved again. Had I wished, I could have married again,&#xD;
and you perhaps would have found a more comfortable home; but I cherished and loved your fa-&#xD;
ther's memory too well for that, and all the love for earth in my heart has been bestowed upon&#xD;
you, and will be until death."&#xD;
" Why, mother, I have often thought of it, and felt proud that you never married a second time.&#xD;
I never could have loved you as I do, had you been married ever so well, as they say. I had&#xD;
rather live in our humble cottage than in-the handsomest house in town, and be a mere dependant&#xD;
upon a father that ain't mine, though he may be my mother's husband, and find your love divided&#xD;
among brothers and sisters, that are not mine. Tell me mother, what it is that you want me to&#xD;
do, and I will do it at any sacrifice."&#xD;
"There may be a temporary sacrifice, my dear boy, but it will be for your permanent good.&#xD;
We are now all in all to each other, my child, and I want it to always be so while mother lives. I&#xD;
am not healthy, Clarence, and though I have never told you so before, for the fear of alarming,&#xD;
yet I may as well tell yo,u now that this coughing and pain which I have is increasing; and your&#xD;
mother will not live a great many years longer;,but while I do live, love no other one but me."&#xD;
The affectionate boy flung his arms about his mother's neck, and kissed her again and again,&#xD;
while he begged her not to talk of dying, that she would be better of the cough,*and added, "Dear&#xD;
mother, who have I to love but you?"&#xD;
Why, my son, but a moment ago you was asking me how I would like little Fanny for a daugh-&#xD;
ter -in-law ?" said the mother smilingly.&#xD;
Why, mother, she is only fifteen years old, and when she gets older, and I get older, and you&#xD;
get older-"&#xD;
"No, Clarence. You would say then your mother will agree to your marrying Fanny. No, my&#xD;
son,.before your time to select agirl who would make a suitable wife for you arrives, Fanny will pro-&#xD;
bably be married, and perhaps the mother of half a dozen children, but never to you. Your dispo-&#xD;
sition is too sanguine to think of a wife for years. Your character may not be formed until you&#xD;
arrive at mature manhood, and with a mind so constituted as yours, were you to marry at an&#xD;
early period of your life your choice would be such a one as your more experienced years would&#xD;
disapprove, and were you not lucky enough to make choice of one whose tastes and.ideas were not&#xD;
like yours, God help you, my child, for with your impetuous disposition, yours and her future&#xD;
life would be a wretched one. No, no, love mother until you are thirty, and then if you see fit to&#xD;
look about for a companion, well and good. You will not be as old then for a man as Fanny is&#xD;
how for a girl; but I shall never live, my child, to see you reach the prime of your years ; but do&#xD;
not marry uitil then, and promise mother that you will never marry while she lives, or engage&#xD;
yourself to be married until she is dead. You have never told me a lie or deceived me, but pro-&#xD;
mise me this, and my mind will be easy, and then youmay make as many acquaintances as you&#xD;
Please omong young ladies, and I shall, perhaps, be disposed to like little Fanny Gould. Trust&#xD;
mother my child, in this matter, and you will never regret it." Clarence hesitated a moment,&#xD;
and then seeing the anxious expression about his mother's face, he placed his arm about her, drew&#xD;
her to his heart, and as he kissed her lips he whispered, " Dear mother, I will promise, and at all&#xD;
costs will keep it." Hie did keep it in after years, at a cost more dear than he bargained for. The&#xD;
relieved mother returned the kiss,-and a few moments after he yas on his way to old Columbia.&#xD;
When Clarence reached Park Place, the college bell was ringing. At three o'clodk he left the&#xD;
inttton; hedtermined te take s turn down Broadway, drop into Dplmionico's, and, if possible,&#xD;

to find the Colonel. He was on his way there, ond had just passed the City Hotel, when who should&#xD;
he overtake on their way home from school but Fanny Gould and her sister Lydia.&#xD;
4 Why, Clarence, how glad I am to see you. Why have you not been to see us? I really think&#xD;
you have neglected us since you were at our house, and I feel quite bad about it."&#xD;
"Bless your heart, Miss Fanny, I was expecting that you ind your mother would come up to&#xD;
our house to see my mother before this. Don't you remember your promise ?"&#xD;
" La, me! Have you not seen my uncle, and don't you know that-?"&#xD;
"Know what, Fanny?, I have not seen the Colonel."     '   I&#xD;
" Mama has been very ill indeed, and unable to leave her room, and we thought, of course, you&#xD;
would have heard of it from the Colonel. Why sis. and I haven't been to school before to-day sino&#xD;
we last saw you."&#xD;
"But I hope your mother is not dangerously ill?"&#xD;
"Not now she ain't. The doctor says she will get well very fast, and ,then we will all go up to&#xD;
see your mama. Now let's walk along. Of course you will go home with us ?"1&#xD;
Clarence consented, and the three young people had a sociable chat together down Broadway un-&#xD;
til they reached the home of the two young Iadies. They left Clarence and went directly to their&#xD;
mother's room, and shortly afterwards Fanny returned and told Clarence her mother wished&#xD;
to see him, and together they went up into her apartment.I&#xD;
The sick lady was sitting up in bed, and as Clarence approached her, she took hold of his hand,&#xD;
and drew him towards her, and impressed a kiss upon his -brow. "I am glad to see you, Clarence,&#xD;
and how is your mother? Did you tell her that I was very anxious to make her acquaintance, and&#xD;
that I would call ?"&#xD;
"I did, and she will be very happy to see you."&#xD;
"I have been very ill. Come, sit down by the side of the bed, and talk to me. Sickness makes&#xD;
a great change in people, does it not, Clarence ?"&#xD;
" Yes, indeed, madam; and you look very different. Why you are so thin that one could almost&#xD;
see through you."&#xD;
"And; dear Clarence, I think I can almost see through myself. I feel very different from what&#xD;
I did before this illness came on A sick bed is a sad monitor, Clarence. Tell me all about your&#xD;
mother. She has had a great many troubles, has she not?" Clak'ence said she had, and then went&#xD;
on to relate what his mother had said about her own increasing ill health, and when he had fin.&#xD;
ished, Mrs Gould asked.him if, in case he should lose his mother, he would not feel that he had met&#xD;
with a great loss? The idea was a new one, and Clarence was silent for some time. . He had nev-&#xD;
er thought of it before,.and then he quietly added :"INo, I sh ould not feel bad, for if my mother&#xD;
was to die and leave me I don't think I should live long after her. She is the only being on earth&#xD;
that ever loved me or that I ever loved.'&#xD;
" God bless you my son; continue to love her, and you will never have cause io regret it in after&#xD;
life. I hope she may be spared to you a great many years, for we never know the value of a mo-&#xD;
ther until we lose her. Other relations may be formed, but the tie that binds a widowed mother&#xD;
and her only son, when death severs it, can never be united again in this world. Clarence, it&#xD;
may be some days before I can leave my room to go and make the acquaintance of your mother,&#xD;
don't you think you could persuade her to' overlook all ceremony and come down and spend a day&#xD;
with me-say to morrow; I will send a carriage for her early in the morning, and you *could talk&#xD;
with her to-night ?" Clarence hesitated for some moments, and the thought flashed across his&#xD;
mind of how secluded a life his mother had ever led, and how closely she-had devoted her whole&#xD;
time to the comfort of their own home The idea' of his mother making any acquaintance with&#xD;
families, or of going out any where except to some neighboring church, (for she had long ceased&#xD;
to go down town to the French church in Pine street. thinking the pastor too much a m'an of the&#xD;
world and too devoted to the good things of it to add much to the religious comfort of the afflicted,)&#xD;
or to some place of public amusement. Mrs Gould noticed his hesitation and asked him if he did&#xD;
not think his mother would come?&#xD;
" Really," replied Clarence, " the request is so novel and so unusual a one, that I do not know&#xD;
what to say. It would be to hers like undertaking a long voyage. I wish she would I would&#xD;
like to have her go into company now that I think of it, and not live so secluded. If you will be&#xD;
so kind as to send up in the morning for her, I will do all that I can to persuade her to come and&#xD;
spend the dag with you."&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.&#xD;

&#xD;
" That's a good boy, and Clarence you must come here also as soon as you get through with&#xD;
ybur College duties, and I have a favor to ask of you."&#xD;
"What is it, dear lady? Anything that I can do I will do with pleasure."&#xD;
* "It is this. The saving of the life of my child is not an every day occurenee, and I want to&#xD;
obtain a certain something that I can- always have about me. I wish you to get your likeness&#xD;
taken and be dressed as you were the day that you were in the water. You will get older, and&#xD;
your features will change, and you will-not be so&#xD;
interesting."&#xD;
. "Well, lady, I am in luck, for I have a minia-&#xD;
ture of myself, which was only finished the day&#xD;
previous to the swimming excursion. It is an&#xD;
excellent likeness, so my mother says, and you&#xD;
shall have it to-morrow for I do not want it.      "Z&#xD;
The artist is a friend of mine and I suppose, for&#xD;
want of something better to do, he insisted upon&#xD;
painting my likeness, and gave it to me after-&#xD;
wards. I intended to give it to my mother "&#xD;
"That was kind of you, and I wont deprive&#xD;
your mother of it, or at least a copy of it. Does  N&#xD;
your friend, the artist, paint for a living ?"&#xD;
"Yes, he lives, and hasn't anything else to get&#xD;
a living by."&#xD;
"Then tell him to paint a duplicate and charge&#xD;
me the usual price, and a 'your mother has the&#xD;
original subject always with her, it will only be&#xD;
fair that she should give me the original likeness,&#xD;
and let her have the, copy."&#xD;
We give the likeness given to Mrs. Gould, which will no doubt please and gratify our rba-&#xD;
ders, as it is the only correct likeness yet In existence of Clarence, who was in his 18th year.&#xD;
Clarence remained until iea was brought up for him in the sick room, then, after having'really&#xD;
won the affection of the mother of Fanny by his kind hearted and frank conversation, he kissed&#xD;
her, bade the two sisters good night, and took his departure for his own home.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV,&#xD;
CONTENTS-Clarence revails uponhis mother to visit, fr. ould-note from Colonel Vanderhoost-the game of Domi.&#xD;
noei at Dolmonioo's-a poetio conversation, &amp;amp;o.&#xD;
,4IjEVER had Clarence returned home so elated in&#xD;
spirits, as on the evening after his afternoon visit&#xD;
fit 1        to Mrs. Gould in. her sick.chamber. He had&#xD;
learned to love her, sand he felt that she had from&#xD;
one cause or another bestowed a portion of her&#xD;
J I  motherly affection upon him. Her anxiety to&#xD;
become personally acquainted with his mother&#xD;
had touched the tender chord in his bosom. To&#xD;
gain his confidence there was no way more sure&#xD;
than to be kind and affectionate to his mother.&#xD;
What will not a mother do for a child she idolizes.&#xD;
It weighed more in his estimation than any pos.&#xD;
'sible kindness which could have been shown to&#xD;
himself. He was now all anxiety to see the two&#xD;
mothers personally intimate, for he felt that if&#xD;
they ever knew each other, they would love and&#xD;
11be friends. But it was a delicate subject to&#xD;
manage. He knew his mother's determination&#xD;
never to go into any society, or to court any ac-&#xD;
quaintances, and least of all those, that were her&#xD;
superiors in the gifts of fortune and position. Clarence coxnmenced his attack by a simple nar-&#xD;
ration of every thing that had occurred, and added, "My dear mother, do precisely as it pleases&#xD;
you, and if you will not go down to-morrow and see Mrs. Gould, I will call, and I am sure that I&#xD;
can make such explanation as will satisfy her, if she Ehould feel that your non- compliance with&#xD;
her request was rather unkind."&#xD;
"No, Clarence, that will be unnecessary. For your sake, my son, I will do as the rich lady de-&#xD;
sires. . When she sends for me in the morning I will be ready to go."&#xD;
" Thanks, my darling mother; you have made me completely happy ," and the loving boy flung&#xD;
his arms about her neck and covered her face with kisses.&#xD;
"Now, Clarence, consider this matter all settled. Do you call at Mr. Gould's house towards the&#xD;
close of the afternoon and come home with me. There has been a letter sent here for you; I laid&#xD;
it on the mantel piece-go and get it."&#xD;
" Who is it from, mother?: Ah, I see it is-from Colonel Vanderhoost," and Clarence read aloud&#xD;
as follows.&#xD;
"RANIlLN SQUARE.&#xD;
" My DEAR Boy-Why have you not been to see me? . I have been under the weather for a&#xD;
few days, and am most anxious to take a look at you. I send this note to you this evening, and&#xD;
wish yoi to meet 'me at our old dining place to morrow afternoon after you get out of College.&#xD;
Wait for' me if you reach Del. 's first, and don't venture to order dinner until Fcome. Ytou have&#xD;
not yet experience enough to do it and suit my taste. To-morrow-Del.'s-5 o'clock-ydinner and&#xD;
talk.                             Yours,                                       W. V.&#xD;
"Thursday afternoon."&#xD;
" There, mother, I knew there was some good reason for my not having heard from the Colonel.&#xD;
He has been sick. Why did he not let me know? Of course I will meet him to.-morrow, as he pro-&#xD;
poses; and then after we have dined I can go round to Mr. Gould's for you. Will that suit you,&#xD;
mother ?1.&#xD;
"1 Certainly, my son; perhaps the Colonel will accompany you."&#xD;
"I am sure he will, and now good bye, for I must go up stairs and go to work."&#xD;
The next afternoon Clarence left College, and soon after was at Delmonico's. He looked at the&#xD;
clock, and found that there was still left an hour at his own diRposal, before the time Colonel V.&#xD;
would get there. Determined to amuse himself the best way possible, he passed back into a long&#xD;
room filled with small tables, at which sat many gentlemen engaged in the game of dominoes, and *&#xD;
drinking at the same time strong cffee from out little white cups, and cordials from little wine&#xD;
glasses. It was a new scene to him, though a very common one at the present day. It is a luxury&#xD;
after dinner in the fashionable and mercantile circles of the community, and altogether an un-&#xD;
&#xD;
healthy foreign custom: its introduction has been the cause of sending many of the first literary&#xD;
men of our land to a premature grave, or the mad house. Some of the most gifted minds in the&#xD;
country have been destroyed by this pernicious custom. The disease known as delirium tremens,&#xD;
caused by the ordinary stimulants, may injure mind as well as body; but the upper crust-drunk-&#xD;
ard, who uses strong coffee, burnt brandy, kirschwasser, and other strong cordials, with regu-&#xD;
larity, and to such an extent as to produce a complete prostration of the nervous system, has to&#xD;
increase the quantity and frequency of his potations to re-establish his nervous system, until at&#xD;
last, its vigor is entirely gone, and the mind becomes a wreck, shattered and ruined. Madness fol-&#xD;
lows, and hope of restoration is gone also; for the poor cordial andcoffee drinking maniae rarely,&#xD;
if ever, recovers the use of his reason, and his future is a burdensome state of existence to himself&#xD;
and those who love him, and the sooner death takes the victim, the less is the sorrow.&#xD;
While Clarence was gazing at this motley group of gentlemen around the different tables, and&#xD;
listening to their excited conversation, which appeared to be called forth by the most trifling of&#xD;
all objects-a game of dominoes-a young gentleman, with a nice moustache and an imperial, enter-&#xD;
ed the room, and came and seated himself in a vacant chair at the opposite side of the table at&#xD;
which Clarence was seated. Upon the marble table between them was a set of dominoes, that&#xD;
were not in use.- The gentleman commenced shuffling and mixing them, at the same time addressed&#xD;
Clarence, to know if he was willing to play a game of dominoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you, sir," replied Clarence; "but I never played a game in my life, and do not under-&#xD;
stand it."&#xD;
"It is a very simple matter to learn it, if you are so disposed," replied the other. "You have&#xD;
but to match the spots or blanks of the different pieces withthe corresponding one, if yen hold it,&#xD;
and that is all. Suppose [ teach you the game ?"&#xD;
"But what is inirolved? Is there any expense or any betting ?"&#xD;
"Oh, no. The proprietor of-the house don't charge for using the dominoes ; but thosewho use&#xD;
them generally play for some trifle, although it's only for a little excitement. Sometimes it's for&#xD;
cigars, drinks, coffee, a dinner or bottle of wine. No gambling-is allowed. If you like, we will,&#xD;
play for a cup of cofee and cordial."&#xD;
"Very well. I would like to learn the game, if only to say that I know how to play it. As you&#xD;
seem at home here, will you call for the articles ?"&#xD;
"Gargon, bring us'two cups of coffee, and bring me one petite verre d' eau de vie. What will&#xD;
you have, sir: a glass of brandy, curacoa, or-kirschwassor ?"&#xD;

CLARENCE BOLTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
The last name struck the fancy of Clarence, and he decided to try it, if only for experiment; but&#xD;
when it was brought to him, and he had sipped a few drops from the small-cordial glass, he placed,&#xD;
it hastily on the table, exclaiming:&#xD;
"Mother of mercy! why, that stuff, sir, is liquid fire. Do people ever drink it ?"&#xD;
"It is strong," replied the stranger;," but if you will notice the other tables, you will perceive&#xD;
that half the people in the room are at this moment partaking of it. Do you know what it is&#xD;
made of?"&#xD;
"How should I? I reckon, however, that it is made of melted iron; it has fairly burned my&#xD;
Inouth. What is it ?"&#xD;
" It is similar to prussic acid, only more reduced. It is formed from the same primitive mate.&#xD;
rials-the kernels of peach stones. Of course it is very much diluted and reduced, and don't kill&#xD;
instantly, as prussic acid would do. Kirschwasser takes a longer time to produce death; but, al-&#xD;
though its operation.is slow, it is equally fatal in the long run. I never drink it.".&#xD;
" Knowing what you have just told me, I should take you to be a precious fool if you did. Ex-&#xD;
Ouse me, sir, but who does drink it ?"&#xD;
" Most generally broken down merchants, who need high excitement; foreigners; sometimes&#xD;
young men, who are not acquainted with tle secret of its noxious and deadly qualities, but be-&#xD;
cause they see others use it, and see it on the .Ilist of wines, &amp;amp;c.,' at the principal hotels, coffee&#xD;
houses, and restaurants; literary young men drink it, when they wish to get into a state of mind&#xD;
bordering on frenzy. Heaven preserve you, my stranger friend; did you ever read poetry ?"&#xD;
" Certainly; I am passionately-fond of poetry that combines good sense and original ideas, with&#xD;
good rhyme."&#xD;
"I can tell you a secret worth knowing. But first, do you ever Write poetry ?"&#xD;
"No; I can't say that I do. At least, I never tried."&#xD;
"Wait a while, untilyou get in love: that will fetch out the poetry, which I am quite sure you&#xD;
have got in you. Do you know why great poets go mad and die early, come the comet dodge over&#xD;
the world, astonish it, and then go out and go off? It is drink, generally speaking; but the high-&#xD;
est flights-the most astonishing feats in poetry, are engendered by the most infernal concoctions&#xD;
of stimulants, which the world calls 'cordials,' and think they are harmless. Do you ever read&#xD;
Byron's poetry ?"&#xD;
"Yes; I have read samples of his poetry."&#xD;
"Samples ? at school or college, for your exercises, I suppose. Well, let me give you a sample,&#xD;
which you never have read or seen in either of those places, I'll be bound. It is from Byron's&#xD;
Cain. Lucky I have it in my pocket to read to you. Now listen:&#xD;
ENTER LUCIFER.&#xD;
Lucifer-Mortal!&#xD;
Cain-Spirit, who art thou ?&#xD;
Lucifer-Master of spirits.&#xD;
Cain-And being so, canst thou leave them, anawalk with dust?&#xD;
Lucifer-I know the thoughts of dust, and feel for it, and with you.&#xD;
Cain-How !'you know my thoughts?&#xD;
Lucfer-They are the thoughts of all worthy of thought: 'tis your immortal part which speaks,&#xD;
within you.      I&#xD;
Cain-What immortal part? This has not been revealed: the tree of life was withheld from us&#xD;
by my father's folly, while that of knowledge, by my mother's haste, was plucked too soon ; and&#xD;
all the first is death!&#xD;
Lucifer-They have deceived thee; thou shalt live.&#xD;
Cain-I live, but live to die; and, living, see nothing to make death hateful save an innate&#xD;
clinging, a loathsome, and yet an invincible instinct of life, which I abhor, as I despise myself,&#xD;
yet caniot overcome, and so I live. Would that I had never lived!&#xD;
Luc~fer-Thou livest, and must live forever ; think not the earth, which is thine outward cover-&#xD;
ing, is existence. It will cease, and thou wilt be no less than thou art now. .&#xD;
Cain-No less ! and why no more ?&#xD;
Lueger-It may be thou shalt be as we&#xD;
Cain-And ye?&#xD;
Lucifer-Are everlasting.&#xD;
Cain-Are ye happy?&#xD;
&#xD;
Lucifer-No. Art thou?&#xD;
Cain-How should I be so ? Look on me&#xD;
Lucifer--Poor clay, and thou pretendest to be wretched! Thou!&#xD;
Cain--I am; and thou, with all thy might, what art thou?&#xD;
Lucifer-One who aspired to be what made thee, and mould not have made thee what thou art.&#xD;
Cain-Who! thou lookest almost a god; and-&#xD;
Lucifer-I am more: and having failed to be one, would be naught save what I am. He con-&#xD;
quered ; let him reign!&#xD;
Cain-Who ?'&#xD;
Now, my young friend, what do you think of that style of writing? Rather on the high key,&#xD;
ain't it ?"&#xD;
" I admire it very much. Byron was a great writer."&#xD;
"Exactly; but his shades were caused by drink. He drank all sorts: brandy, gig and kirosh-&#xD;
wasser. The above specimen was written under the influence of kirsch.&#xD;
"How? Lord Byron did not write it ?"&#xD;
"Of course he did; but he had been drinking kirschwasser until he felt like Lucifer himself, and&#xD;
his imagination excited by the drinks, took the turn you have heard. If he had been drinking gin&#xD;
instead, he never would have wrote Cain in the style he did. Do you understand me ?"&#xD;
"Not perfectly ; although I have a faint idea of what you would convey to my mind."&#xD;
"I will endeavor to explain more clearly. Suppose now that one of our New Yorkplay writers&#xD;
had been called upon towrite that portion of Cain, how do you suppose he would have rendered it?&#xD;
You must suppose him to have had the blues, like Byron, resulting from a high spree, only with&#xD;
this difference, that the American writer Iad been corned on plain three cent gin. Such pieces,&#xD;
mark you, are not written until after the spree, and when the writer has the shakes and incipient&#xD;
horrors upon him, feels smoky and snaky about the head, is writing, and at the same time drinking&#xD;
or steaming up to come round again. It is at such a time, the writer would produce a Cain, or&#xD;
some other wretched character. One of our modern geniuses, if called upon when drinking on&#xD;
dead liquor, would have produced the followiing Cain, under precisely the same circumstanoen&#xD;
ENTER LUCIFER.&#xD;
L ucifer-Hoss!&#xD;
Cain-Who the -    are you?&#xD;
Lucifer-Me, myself, and nobody else&#xD;
Cain-Well, what of it? Don't be coming in here to kick up a muss. Why don't you keep&#xD;
company with your own fellows? What are you driving at, any way?&#xD;
Lucifer-Oh, shut up. I know exactly how you feel, and I am for and with you. Ivs-&#xD;
ain't it?&#xD;
Cain-How! You know how I feel?&#xD;
Lucifer-To be sure I do. Anybody what has got any brains tods too strong occasionally. It's&#xD;
the liquor that makes you so infernal smokey, and speaks within you.&#xD;
Cain-What! You don't tell me that? Blame my skin if I ever knew it before. The fact is,&#xD;
I must cut it. My old man has often told me not Io drink, but hang me, If he ever told me that&#xD;
I'd feel this way. My mother has cautioned me to taper off. Why in the end it will kill a fellow.&#xD;
Lucifer-Hold on a bit; you will get over it, and feel better, if you don't lush any more.&#xD;
Cain-I'll get over it? You don't say say so, for hang me if I hain't got the horrors; every.&#xD;
thing is hateful, nothing hopeful,- I'm blowed if I wouldn't kill myself, or do something horrible,&#xD;
but lam too used up. I abhor myself; blast meif I ain't loathsome to myself; I cannot cut liquor;&#xD;
I wish I had neverbeen born.&#xD;
Lucifer--Oh, go away with your nonsense. You have got to go ahead andget your living some&#xD;
way or another. It's no use knocking under; and even if you do die, you can't help it;you only/&#xD;
get rid of your old clothes. You will still be shying about somewhere. You won't have any&#xD;
more or less tin than yoS've7got now.&#xD;
Cain-No-less, and why no more?&#xD;
Lucifer-Why ? You will be like me, that's why, and I haven't got' a mnag, and nio tick neither..&#xD;
Can - And yet you get liquor ?&#xD;

that drink does it. You have got no chance to be wretched. Bah!&#xD;
Cain--I am. I feel like Julius Coesar Hannibal; but you are such an old sucker. Who in the&#xD;
are you, any way ?&#xD;
Lucifer-Me? I am one who aspired to be somebody; but, I took the liquor, and. it has given&#xD;
vme fits-aye, fits. It has fixed you too, or will do it.&#xD;
Cain-You are right. Go it while you are young; and yet you look, methinks, as though you&#xD;
might have succeeded to become somebody, and-&#xD;
Lucifer-'Taint no matter. I ain't nobody. I failed, and now I wouldn't give a straw to be&#xD;
anything else than what I am. I'm content, as they say in -  row. He got the best of me, now&#xD;
let him shine out as much as he pleases.&#xD;
Cain--Who?'&#xD;
"What do you think of that, young gentleman ?"&#xD;
"Me, sir. I really yet don't comprehend it."&#xD;
"Then all I have to say is this. -Both of these productions are a fair sample of what different&#xD;
liquors would produce upon the minds of men of genius in any country, or in any age. Kirch-&#xD;
wasser, at a shilling a glass, would produce Cain No. 1, and kill the writer early, and thee cent&#xD;
gin would produce Cain No. 2, and eventually send the writer to the a'm's house I o die at his ease."&#xD;
-"Well, sir, I am very much obliged to you for the information I have derived, but, meanwhile,&#xD;
our dominoes have been lying idhe, but I will willingly pay the amount of our bill"&#xD;
"Could not permit it at all. Will you favor me with your name ? Hero is my, card." And as&#xD;
Clarence looked at it, he read the name of Frederick Dressy, whom he had often heard his College&#xD;
companions allude to as one of the most wealthy and accomplished bloods of the city. Clarence&#xD;
bowed and expressed his pleasure at having made the acquaintance of Mr. Dressy, at the same&#xD;
time modestly observed, "I have no card, but my name is Clarence Bolton. I am a student at&#xD;
Columbia College, and am here to meet Colonel Vanderhoost."&#xD;
" My dear fellow, do you know the Colonel? He is a friend of mine; here he comes.&#xD;
It was Colonel Vanderhoost, and as he approached the two sitters, he extended his hand to&#xD;
Clarence, and at the same time remarked, "Ah, my dear Clarence, I am glad to see you, and pre.&#xD;
cious company you have got into. How do you do, Fred? How came you acquainted with my&#xD;
protege ?"-&#xD;
" Why, Colonel, it's only a moment since I was aware that he was an.acquaintance of yours. I&#xD;
found a very nice looking youth alone here, and I scraped an acquaintance with -him, for the&#xD;
purpose of playing a game of dominoes. We have neglected the dominoes to talk of literature."&#xD;
"That is all, is it? Why, Clarence, I was startled. Do you know that this young gentle-&#xD;
man is one of the most accomplished rou's in town, and would corrupt i convent. Have care. I.&#xD;
don't think I shall permit you to continue his acquaintance."&#xD;
" Ah, Colonel, you do megreat injustice in speaking of me in this manner. I a roue? Why,&#xD;
Colonel, if one-half of the stories told about you and your younger days are true, I am a saint&#xD;
in the comparison. But never mind him, Mr. Bolton, I am proud to have made your acquaint-&#xD;
ance, and I dare say we shall meet often, and now I must bid you good bye."&#xD;
After the departure of the fashionable youth we have introduced to our readers as Mr. Dressy,&#xD;
-the Colonel merely remarked, "Clarence, I want to give you that young man's history before&#xD;
you associate with him, and I have no time now. Tell me all that has passed since I saw you ?"&#xD;
Clarence did so. " Bravo, my boy, and your mother and my sister have been spending the day&#xD;
with each other. I want to witness so pleasant a sight as seeing them together, and as I can say&#xD;
what I, wish to say to-day to you as we are walking, we may as well proceed at once to Mr.&#xD;
Gould's house."&#xD;
When they reached there the lamps were lighted, and they found all of the family, save Mr.&#xD;
Gould, in the room of his wife, and the mother of Clarence with them.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHA PTER XV.&#xD;
CONTENTS-Clarence and mother visits the Gould family-Clarence's prospects-Mrs. Gould and Fannyvisits the mo-&#xD;
ther of Clarence-a love scene-an interval of five years.&#xD;
NE of the most happy hours that Clarence had&#xD;
ever known -was that at the residence of Mr.&#xD;
Gould, where he saw all those he sincerely loved&#xD;
grouped together about him, and his mother ap-&#xD;
parently enjoying herself, as well as any of the&#xD;
rest of the party. Clarence had a sociable chat&#xD;
with Fanny, and the fair girl seemed as much&#xD;
pleased as himself, and when the time arrived&#xD;
for his mother's departure, there was a cordial&#xD;
embracing and shaking of hands, as much so as if&#xD;
they had known each other all their lives.&#xD;
The Colonel volunteered his services, as the&#xD;
evening was a pleasant one, to form one of Mrs.&#xD;
Bolton's escort to her residence. As they walked&#xD;
homeward the Colonel conversed mostly about&#xD;
Clarence and his prospects, and detailed a plan&#xD;
he had formed in his own mind in respect to&#xD;
Clarence, with which the widow seemed pleased,&#xD;
but required time to think over it.&#xD;
When they reached the cottage the Colonel bade them both good night, and came down town&#xD;
again, perfectly satisfied that his protege was in a fair train to justify all the expectations he had&#xD;
formed of him. When the mother and son were alone, the former, ever evincing a mother's inte-&#xD;
rest, asked how he had spent the day? Clarence told her, with his usual frankness, and the fond&#xD;
mother cautioned him long and earnestly against drinking spirits, cordials, wines, or any drinks&#xD;
that would intoxicate. "It is a bad habit, Clarence; and by all means shun it. The habit grows&#xD;
upon a person as he increases in years, until finally the unhappy individual becomes a perfect sot,&#xD;
and worthless to society. We also had an abundance of wines at dinner to- day, and I was very&#xD;
glad to perceive that your interesting friend Fanny did not drink any."&#xD;
"She never touches a drop, mother; she told me so with her own sweet mouth the day I dined&#xD;
there."&#xD;
"My son, for an elderly lady to use wine or strong drink is bad enough ; but for a young and&#xD;
otherwise innocent girl to get/into the habit of drinking wine, is perfectly shocking. It leads in&#xD;
the end to ruin, for it is the parent of every indiscretion, and must overthrow all domestic happi-&#xD;
ness. I perceive clearly, Clarence, that.it will not be long before your friend Colonel Vander-&#xD;
hoost will insist upon introducing you into what is called the fashionable circle of our city so-&#xD;
ciety, and now I beg of you that if ever, in after years, you should think of forming a Trarriage&#xD;
connection, and it should be among that class, ascertain truly whether the young lady you may&#xD;
select has been accustomed to wine drinking in the home where she has been brought up, whether&#xD;
of parents or guardians. If you find that such is the case, break off at once, in your own mind,&#xD;
all hope or desire for such a union. unless you design to trifle with the honor and happiness of&#xD;
your and herself. No young lady is safe to become a wife who has acquired a habit of wine&#xD;
drinking in the days of her girlhood., You have been a witness of the sad effects which the habit&#xD;
produces upon young men of your, acquaintance. I assure you, Clarence, that it produces still&#xD;
more uncertain effects upon young girls, and under its infiuenee they are very much exposed to&#xD;
temptations which they have not the strength of mind to resist. I speak of the daughters of the&#xD;
wealthy class, such as your acquaintance, Mr. Gould, claims to belong to."&#xD;
" Why do you allude, dear mother, to danger in the habit with that class of young ladies from&#xD;
wine drinking more than to any other-the middling er poorer classes, for instance ?"&#xD;
"Because, my child, they are more exposed. They are more indolent and idle.- They have~&#xD;
very little to do between the interval of leaving school and of getting married. They read novels,,&#xD;
play, dance, dress, eat and drink,-and receive company ; their minds are not occupied in a useful&#xD;
manner. That is bad enough, but added to it the stimulus of the richest viands, highly seasoned&#xD;

&#xD;
food, and wine drinking at dinner, these things, in connection with the false sentiments acquired&#xD;
by foolish novel reading, not unfrequently produce the most unhappy consequences. That is not&#xD;
the kind of education I wish for the young lady who will become my son's wife. Now lt's talk&#xD;
of something else. What do you think of the proposal made by the Colonel? I was really inter-&#xD;
ested in his plans for you, and as he proceeded to unfold them to me, I began to perceive clearly,&#xD;
for the first-time, his real views in placingyou on a good footing with the Gould set. Have done him&#xD;
wrong. -I thought he had somewhat different views, which did not please me so well. How truly&#xD;
I thank him for his kindness in interesting himself so deeply in your affairs my acquiescence in&#xD;
his views shall convince him. Until now, Clarence, I have never dared to look forward in your&#xD;
career beyond the approaching day when- you will graduate from College. We can safely reach&#xD;
that point, and aftei that my trust was solely in Providence, that he would open some new career&#xD;
for you. I know that I can now be of no further use to you, Clarence, except to watch over y ou&#xD;
at home, and provide for all your little comforts; but the means to do so must now come from my&#xD;
boy. I have learned from the conversation of Colonel Vanderhoost to night, that he has taken&#xD;
everything into consideration-is aware of our exact circumstances, and that his plan for your&#xD;
benefit for the next five years is a good one, and will succeed. But, five years, Clarence! what&#xD;
may not arise in five years? You will then be twenty three years old. I am satisfied the Colonel&#xD;
knows the feasibility of what he has proposed, and his plan has been fully considered"&#xD;
The mother was right. The Colonel had provided a plan fer,the first campaign of Clarence, and&#xD;
had been carefully maturing it, unknown to any one besitle himself, until he conversed with Mrs.&#xD;
Bolton about it that evening.&#xD;
"Well, mother, I like it; and if it meets your approval, let the Colonel act as he pleases, and I&#xD;
will do all that he wishes me to do. Now, mother, it is near your bed time, and I have two or&#xD;
three hours work to do before I go to sleep. How I do detest these College lessons, for I am now&#xD;
anxious to do something for myself. Never mind; a few days more, and they will be over with'&#xD;
Is Mrs. Gould coming up here, mother ?"&#xD;
"I believe so-at leist, she told me that she should do so, and bring her daughters with her, as&#xD;
soon as she was able to leave her sick room."&#xD;
"How I wish I knew when that would be, for I want to be at home, and would liketo take the&#xD;
girls to see the ship yards."&#xD;
"That is easily arranged, for they will spend the afternoon, and now good night, Clarence."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.                                   75&#xD;
Several days passed away, and Clarence was busily engaged in pursuing his studies, and had&#xD;
seen-no more of his friends, except'the Colonel, who had called to spend an evening at the cottage,&#xD;
and to talk more fully of his plans, with the mother of Clarence. About three week; after the&#xD;
widow had visited Mrs. Gould, a carriage drove up opposite the gate-way. Clarence had been&#xD;
gone over two hours his mother was occupied in one of the upper rooms, and her attention was&#xD;
attracted to the arrival of the carriage by the barking of Beppo.&#xD;
She raised the window, and looked out to discover the cause of the alarm from the dog. She&#xD;
perceived the carriage at the gate, and became certain to whom it belonged, when the carriage&#xD;
door was opened, the steps let down, and the lovely Fanny descended them.&#xD;
"It is only Beppo, mother; he don't' know me yet," was spoken in the sweet tones which had&#xD;
already become familiar to the ears of the widow. She descended and opened the door. Beppo's&#xD;
bark was no longer heard; the sagacious animal had already recognized the young girl, and was&#xD;
showing the fact in every possible way to the manifest delight of Fanny, who was returning his&#xD;
rough caresses very earnestly.&#xD;
"Don't be alarmed, Mrs. Gould," said the widow, as she saw'that the elder visitor hesitated,&#xD;
and hastened to the gate to meet her. Mutual salutations followed, and the widow asked after&#xD;
Lydia.,-&#xD;
"She was obliged to remain at home. I have only brought Fanny." As they were preparing to&#xD;
enter the house, Mrs. Gould remarked, "I have come to spend the day with you, as I promised,"&#xD;
and turning to the coachman, she ordered him to drive home, and to return in the evening about&#xD;
dark.&#xD;
"Come here, Fanny," said the widow, and the lively girl was in her arms, and kissed her affec-&#xD;
tionately, and the party entered the house. After Mrs. Gould and Fanny were seated, the for-&#xD;
mer observed, "I suppose Clarence is at College ?"&#xD;
" Yes," replied the mother, "he has been gone some time, bpit he-will be back by three o'clock,&#xD;
and meanwhile I hope Fanny will make herself at home, anid I cheerfully give her permission, if&#xD;
she gets tired of hearing two mothers talk, of rummaging every nook and corner of the cottage&#xD;
for her amusement."&#xD;
After a while the two. ladies commenced 4 conversation in regard to their respective domestic&#xD;
matters, and Fanny quietly slipped out of- the room, and Beppo followed, and she seemed to take&#xD;
it for granted that the favorite dog was deputed to do all the honors during his master's absence.&#xD;
With him she proceeded to a general inspection of t'e premises. First, she visited the garden,&#xD;
and looked at the flowers, then the kitchen, and viewed all those arrangements, and finally she&#xD;
found herself in a room on the second floor, and took a seat by a window which overlooked the&#xD;
East River. There was a table covered with papers, and books lay scattered all about. She knew&#xD;
that she was in the room of Clarence, and somehow or the other she felt that she loved every ar-&#xD;
tiole in that old room better-a great deal better-than anything about the splendid mansion of&#xD;
her father. That old pine table possessed a charm about it, which she had never reoognised in&#xD;
mahogany elsewhere. For a long, long time she'leaned her head upon that table, and thought&#xD;
about Clarence, the singularity of their acquaintance, and a hundred other matters, until the&#xD;
truth burst upon her innocent mind that-she loved Clarence. Then tears glistened in her eyes,&#xD;
and fell upon poor Beppo's face, which was turned upwards to her own, 'as though he was en-&#xD;
deavoring to satisfy himself what it was all about.&#xD;
" Beppo-good dog, come here. Do you love me ?" and she placed her head lovingly on his.&#xD;
"I love your master dearly, and why should I not? He saved my life when nobody else would&#xD;
have done it but him, and I do and Will love him for it." Beppo did not make any objeotrons, and&#xD;
probably had none, to Miss Fanny's loving Clarence as' much as she pleased. Then she laid her&#xD;
back in the chair, and while thinking over the matter fell asleep. How long she slept, she knew&#xD;
not, but time flew, and when she awoke Clarence was seated in a chair close by her side, and&#xD;
watching her features with deep emotion. He had 'never seen anything before half so beautiful.&#xD;
" I have caught'you, fair Fanny, in my own den, and you must pay the penalty," and without more&#xD;
ado, he iblaced his arm around her waist, held her in the seat, and covered her, lips with kisses.&#xD;
" Don't dear Clarence,'' exclaimed the blushing girl, " It isnot fair ; I was asleep and dreaming."&#xD;
"PDreaming of What, Fanny ?"&#xD;
" Of you, Clarence, and the last I remember was, telling Beppo how dearly I loved you?&#xD;
It was Clarence's turn now to do a little blushing, and as he listened to the honest and innocent&#xD;
confession of the lovely girl, he gradually withdrew his arm, and looked earnestly into her face,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
as if to read there what kind of love she meant. "You love me, dear Fenny, and so I do love you.&#xD;
You shall be my darling little sister, and I will-"&#xD;
"No, Clarence, I don't want to be your sister at all. I love you, and if you love me, I will be&#xD;
your darling little wife, when we are old enough to get married."&#xD;
Clarence was speechless.0&#xD;
" Oh, Clarence, what have I said--what can you think of me ?&#xD;
" Everything that is kind, good, and lovely. But remain one moment where you are." Fanny&#xD;
was making preparations to leave. "I came in through the garden gate, and our mothers, who&#xD;
are very busy down stairs, don't know that I ain here. Now, have a little patience, and listen to&#xD;
me, and be a good little girl, and don't say a word. You are very young ; your father is very&#xD;
rich and very. proud, while I am very poor, and have nothing on earth but my self and my loved&#xD;
mother, and yet, Fanny, it will not be very many years before I shall have something else than-&#xD;
my mere self. I shall strive hard to win a name-to make money-to be somebody-and when I&#xD;
have done all this-when I have accomplished what is a fixed purpose of my life, then, dear Fan-&#xD;
ny, to hear just such words from your sweet lips as I have heard, would make me very happy;&#xD;
but now it is wrong-it is very wrong for me to listen, or to take advantage of your kind and&#xD;
generous sentiments towards me, or to say I love you. In a few years, you will see thousands&#xD;
that you will love better than Mne, and-"&#xD;
"No, Clarence, never-if I know what love-is."&#xD;
"Listen a moment longer You think so now; but time maires great changes, and infive years,&#xD;
what may not happen ? Until then, were I to breathe the word love to you, or until you are&#xD;
older, it would be base and wrong, and I must not do it; but, Fanny, you, child as you are, and&#xD;
boy as I am yet, you have made me feel towards you as I never felt before to any living being, and&#xD;
we are neither of us old enough to be hypocrites. Wait until you are five years older, and then,&#xD;
Fanny, if you do not change, I will talk to you as I cannot do now."&#xD;
"Clarence, are you angry with me ?"      -&#xD;
"Very, very," replied the youth, as he pressed her in his arms, and kissed the tears from off her&#xD;
cheeks, "but now, Fanny, we must go down stairs; you go first, and I will follow presently. An-&#xD;
gry,? how could I be angry with you, but we are both too young to talk about love yet."&#xD;
Fanny was not pleased, yet she did as Clarence requested her to do, although she did not compre-&#xD;
hend the delicacy of his conduct and language. Clarence did not believe that she knew what real&#xD;
love was. He regarded her as too young to have ever dreamed of such as love. He was in error.&#xD;
She had read, heard, and seen love, and knew the'meaning of the word as well, aye, a great deal bet-&#xD;
ter than Clarence himself. He was the novice. When Clarence was left alone in his room, he&#xD;
muttered to himself, "Well, this is a queer business; but nonsense, she is hardly in her- teens;&#xD;
she don't know what she was talking about. Love! a nice business I shall make of it. What with&#xD;
my promise to my mother, and the views of her purse proud father upon that point, it is quite as&#xD;
well-as it is" After a few miuntes he left his room, passed through the garden, and came around&#xD;
and entered the gateway as though he had just returned from-College. He was greeted very cor-&#xD;
dially by his mother and Mrs. Gould, and he greeted Fanny equally cordially, who received it in&#xD;
silence, which caused her mother to exclaim, "Why, my daughter, what is the matter with you ?&#xD;
Have you not got a kind word for Clarence ?"&#xD;
"I am very glad to see Clarence, mother."&#xD;
" That is as it should be. Now Clarence, come and sitby me; I have got something to tell you."&#xD;
Clarence complied, and she continued: "Your mother and myself have held a very long conver-&#xD;
sation about matters and things in general, and as soon as I have gone, she will tell you all about&#xD;
it. When you graduate you must let me know. I shall take Fanny and Lydia to hear your ora-&#xD;
tion. I suppose you will make one of course. Then we shall see what can be done after you&#xD;
leave College."&#xD;
Clarence thanked the kind hearted lady, and expressed himself much pleased that she should&#xD;
so honor .im as to be present when his class graduated."&#xD;
" Clarence, will you give me Beppo to keep ?" interrupted Fanny. The party addressed looked&#xD;
at Fanny and then at his faithful dog, and thought of his conversation with Colonel Vanderhoost.&#xD;
There was a hard struggle; but after a moment, he replied:&#xD;
" Yes; Fanny, I will give him to you with pleasure ; for I am sure you will be kind to him. I&#xD;
hail miss him very much; but I suppose after I graduate I shall not need a dog, or if I do, I will&#xD;
oome and borrow Bep. Will he be content to remain with you, do you think ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
OLARENCE BOLTON.                                    77&#xD;
" Oh, I am quite sure he will, unless you try and coax him from me. Now you won't do it,&#xD;
will you&#xD;
No.,if he remains contentedly with you, I will never use any exertions to get him from you."&#xD;
"That's a dear, Clarence; and now, mother, Beppo is really and truly my dog to (keep after to-&#xD;
day. May I take him with us in the carriage when we go ?"&#xD;
",Yes, I will coax him into the carriage with you. See how he watches us. I honestly believe&#xD;
he fully comprehends every word we have been saying. You must be a kind -mistress to him,&#xD;
Fanny, for my sake as well as his own."&#xD;
"I will be, Clarence, for your sake as well as his own."&#xD;
After a few words more, the party took their departiire for home. Not long after, Clarence&#xD;
graduated with the highest honors of old Cojumbia. The plans formed for him by his friend Colonel&#xD;
Vanderhoost were carried into effect, and during a period of five years, Clarence pursued the even&#xD;
tenor of his way, and so did all those whose names have appeared in these chapters. Our next&#xD;
chapter will open as Clarence found himself at the expiration of this interval.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI,&#xD;
CONTET-Colonel waniderhoost 'becomes rich-Clarence takes the situation of clerk In a mercantile honse-.Fanny&#xD;
Gould v ,rr ed-Clarence becomes a succesefal merchant, enters the arena of polities, and is nominated&#xD;
for the Leislature.&#xD;
-    1 - RECISELY five years after the event related in&#xD;
the last chapter, where we left Clarence at the&#xD;
J             close of his collegiate career, we find him at the&#xD;
LI                 present time under very different circumstances.&#xD;
It is the fall season of the year, and the prepara.&#xD;
tions are making for the primary elections, and&#xD;
the friends of Clarence in the old Eleventh have&#xD;
determined that he shall be a candidAte for the&#xD;
Legislature at Albany-a position which Clar-&#xD;
ence, for reasons which we have stated in a for-&#xD;
1mer chapter, is most desirous to obtain ; but pre.&#xD;
X1,                      vious to our going into the details of the manner&#xD;
in which a young aspirant for legislative honors&#xD;
tily review the career of Clarence for the five&#xD;
years past.&#xD;
He still continued to reside at the cottage with&#xD;
his mother, who was living, though her health&#xD;
had become much worse, and her days were evi-&#xD;
dently numbered. The cottage was no longer in the open fields, but surrounded by modernbrick&#xD;
houses. The Widow Bolton was still a recluse, and only received visits'from a few friends, her&#xD;
old neighbors, and Mrs. Gould, the wife of the rich broker, whom she had learned to regard as&#xD;
a sister. Colonel Vanderhoost had left the Custom House By aid received from his brother -in-&#xD;
law, he had made extensive purchases in real estate on the islana,.which had risen in price during&#xD;
a year of speculation, that the Colonel found himself an independent man-comparatively speak-&#xD;
ing--at least he was worth fifty thousand dollars, which he had prudently invested in productive&#xD;
realestate, that gave him an income of three-thousand dollars a year-a sum quite sufficient, as&#xD;
the Colonel wisely observed, to support any gentleman in ease and affluence, particularly if he&#xD;
had been through the mill, and had learned the value of money and how to spend it judiciously.&#xD;
The Colonel now occupied a two story house, in one of the streets which run out of Broadway up&#xD;
near Fourth street, and attached to it was a small stable, where he kept a horse and light pleasure&#xD;
wagon    His household arrangements were superintended by an old servant that had lived with&#xD;
his family in prosperous days, and with a boy to attend to the horse and carry notes for the Col-&#xD;
onel, made up his bachelor establishment. Hardly a day passed that he did not receive a visit&#xD;
from his grateful friend, Clarence, who had become as dear to the Colonel as if he had in reality&#xD;
.been his own son.&#xD;
The broker, Mr. Gould, continued to increase in wealth, and it was supposed that he was worth.&#xD;
nearly two millions. His whole soul had been bent on the acquisition of wealth, and his exertions&#xD;
had been blessed in that regard, for it seemed as though anything he touched turned to Gould.&#xD;
After graduating from College, Clarence, in compliance with the wishes of the Colonel accepted&#xD;
a situation in the counting-room of a wealthy merchant, who had become interested in him from&#xD;
the Colonel's representation, and the more particularly so from the fact, that he was strongly&#xD;
recommended by Mr. Gould-a recommendation easily procured by the Colonel, and which had&#xD;
great weight with Mr. Cottonship, the merchant, who had frequent occasions to ask favors of the&#xD;
banker. He agreed to give Clarence a salary from the commencement, to increase it every year,&#xD;
and to afford him an opportunity of acquiring a complete commercial education. This wus very&#xD;
satisfactory to Clarence and to his mother, and he entered the counting-room of bottonship &amp;amp; Co.&#xD;
under the most favorable auspices. He had his evenings to himself, and these he devoted to ac-&#xD;
quiring the French and Spanish languages. He visitedwegularly at the house of his friend Mr.&#xD;
Gould, who always treated him with uncommon courtesy. About two years were spent in this&#xD;
manner, and then Fanny made her entrance into society. Up to this time the intimacy of herself&#xD;
and Clarence had been of the most intimate kind : Clarence liked her, and but ,for his promise&#xD;
to his mother, would have loved her. Her going into society occasioned him no utseasiness; but&#xD;
&#xD;
after one winter of dissipation, Clarence learned to regard her with any other feelings than those&#xD;
of a love, consequently it was without the least emotion he listened to the following address&#xD;
from the Colonel:&#xD;
"Well, Clarence have you heard the news ?".&#xD;
"No; what news ?"&#xD;
"Your favorite Fanny is to be married."&#xD;
"To whom, pray ?"&#xD;
"Can't you guess. Who have you seen most wish her of late ?"&#xD;
"With most everybody."&#xD;
"Well, the happy man is that young Dresser, that I have so often talked to you about."&#xD;
"What! that notorious libertine and rou6 gambler, and I don't know what vice he does not&#xD;
possess Why, Colonel, you surprise me. Does she love him ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I suppose so, as well as a girl that is fond of society can love. As for his qualifloation,&#xD;
he is of good family. Has the reputation of wealth, which I know to be false ; that he is dead&#xD;
broke, and marries Fanny because she has money. He has taken care of that, for the settlements&#xD;
are all drawn, and old Gould gives him fifty thousand dollars to go into business with'one of his&#xD;
own clerks, and settles five thousand dollars a year upon Fanny as long as he lives, and then he&#xD;
is to leave her the principal."&#xD;
" But, Colonel, knowing the sort of person that this young man is, it) astonishes me that you&#xD;
don't interfere. Why not exert your influence with Mr. Gould, and break off the engagement ?"&#xD;
"Pooh, pooh, nonsense! I interfere? I like that! She has got to be married to somebody, and-&#xD;
Fred. Dresser may as well be the man as anybody else. I don't care a' pin who it is, so'long as it&#xD;
ain't you, Clarence. I think, by the way, you might have exercised some influence to break it off,&#xD;
Clarence ; but the fact is, you have treated her very carelessly. * She told me all about her. love&#xD;
talk with you when she visited the cottage, and I fancy she is pretty well aware that you don't in-&#xD;
tend to get married-at least to her."&#xD;
A few weeks after this event, Mr. Dresser and Fanny were married at the resi4ence of Mr.&#xD;
Gould. It was private, but Clarence and his mother were there, and so was the Colonel.&#xD;
Ih11T  IIIi&#xD;
&#xD;
The effect of the'marriage of Fanny upon the mind of Clarence was rather favorable than oth4e&#xD;
Wise. It had taught him a lesson in the changeableness of women, and young ladies in partieul0r&#xD;

and the Colonel did not fail to deepen in the young man's mind the impression. At the expira~ion&#xD;
of the first three years that Clarence was in'the counting-room, he found that he had made at least&#xD;
a very independent position. His employers gave him a liberal 'salary, and he was enabled to&#xD;
surround his mother witha thousand comforts that she had never before possessed. He had gain-&#xD;
ed the entire confidence of his employers, and had made himself so useful that they began to regard&#xD;
bim with r eal respect, and his tasks were such as pleased him much better than when he first en-&#xD;
tered upon a mercantile career. He was of age too, and then he found that all his ambition when&#xD;
a student, to gain fame from knowledge, had vanished, and in place of it he had acquired a fond-&#xD;
ness for trade and money getting. During this time, however, he was making a great many ac-&#xD;
quaintances among the young men of his ward. He had espoused the democratic side and attended&#xD;
the political meetings of that party in his own ward and at Tammany Hall; at the former he was&#xD;
found very useful, and he was not unfrequently called upon to act as secretary and appointed on&#xD;
committees, and he began to love the excitement of them. He was at last elected as a member of&#xD;
one of the Tammany Hall committees for his ward, and considered the honor no small one, and&#xD;
went into all the duties it involved with as much eagerness as those generally do who have an&#xD;
object to gain; but as yet Clarence had none.' His entering into the political field met with the&#xD;
Colonel's approval: that gentleman clearly saw what it would lead to-that Clarence would early&#xD;
form acquaintances that could push him forward into any position that his talents qualified him to&#xD;
fill, and that he would fill any position with credit, Colonel Vanderhoost well knew.&#xD;
When Clarence had finished his fourth year in a counting-room, and offer was made to him, so&#xD;
clearly to his advantage, that even his- employer consented and advised his acceptance of it. One&#xD;
of his classmates in College had also entered a counting-room to learn business at the same time&#xD;
that Clarence did, and their acquaintance was continued, and they had frequent opportunities of&#xD;
meeting. The name of this friend was Harry Lee. He was the son of a very wealthy man, who&#xD;
had formerly been a merchant, but who had retired from business with a large fortune. Clarence,&#xD;
had accompanied Harry ,frequently to his own house, had become acquainted with the old mer-&#xD;
chant, and was a favorite in his house. The son was very anxious to go into business on his own&#xD;
account, and was fully persuaded that he should succeed if he did so. At last he brought the&#xD;
father into his views and persuaded him to gratify his wish., and proposed that Clarence should be-&#xD;
come his partner,, and old Mr. Lee furnish the necessary capital for the new firm. The proposi.&#xD;
tion was accordingly made to Clarence, who, after some deliberation and a great deal of hesitation,&#xD;
concluded to accept, and these two young men became partners, entered into business, and be-'&#xD;
came one of the commercial firms of New York.&#xD;
it is astonishin' how anxious young men in this city, who have been but a short time clerks,&#xD;
are anxious to get into mercantile business on their own account. This ambition is almost uni-&#xD;
versal among American young men who are clerks in counting -rooms and stores. The apprentice&#xD;
is not more anxious to have become of age and have, his time expire, than is the clerk. This am-&#xD;
bition has ruinetl thousands of promising young men who, if they had prudently remained as&#xD;
clerks until they arrived at the age of thirty or thirty-five, would have acquired a solid know-&#xD;
ledge of business, and that experience so necessary to ensure success in mercantile affairs.' But&#xD;
these young men are not disposed to wait. , They are aware of the fact that a mere clerk is regard-&#xD;
ed as a nobody in New York; hence their anxiety to get into business on their own account-to&#xD;
stick up a shingle oftheir own, marry and settle down in life. Even this matter of marriage is&#xD;
a cause of more failures in New York, than any other. Instead of regarding a young man who&#xD;
has a'sure position and a certain and liberal income as a clerk, as an eligible match, most young&#xD;
ladies regard him and his prospects with careless indifference.. This well known fact has stimula-&#xD;
ted thousands to leave. a good position where they were getting twelve or fifteen hundred dollars a&#xD;
'year, to 'go into business where they could not make the half of it. But their object was accom-&#xD;
plished; they married, spent three times their earnings, made a great display for a few months,&#xD;
and then failed and became bad bankrupts, and a reputation among their creditors of dishonest&#xD;
men-a reputation which clings to a man for a life time, and not only places a barrier in the way&#xD;
of his ever becoming a meroha nt again, but even prevents his getting a clerkship with any mer-&#xD;
chant ; for a character for honesty in a young man, is like that of chastity in a young woman--&#xD;
once suspected, all hope is lost. JIn Europe there is no such false feeling in regard to going into&#xD;
business. A man who would succeed eventually as a merchant goes into a long course of train-&#xD;
ing, and his position in society is not at all- affected by the fact that he is a clerk. Those clerks&#xD;
of concerns that are doing a large business is regarded as a much more desirable connection ini&#xD;

&#xD;
matrimonial matters, than the young merchant, whose success is doubtful. Public opinion is&#xD;
regulating that matter in this country. The fact, that out of every one hundred young men that&#xD;
goes into business at an early age in this city, ninety-five become hopeless bankrupts in the&#xD;
course of a few months or years, has made the community somewhat suspicious of merchants, and&#xD;
new beginners in that line rank at about the same grade as young doctors, without patients. Fif-&#xD;
teen years ago a young lady was very loth to unite her destiny with that of a clerk-nothing less&#xD;
than a merchant would serve her turn, But things are changed. . Most of those who were young&#xD;
merchants then, have gone to the dogs; while these who retained the more modest, but more cer-&#xD;
tain position of clerks, are now in existence and retain good incomes, or aTe merchants themselves&#xD;
Clarence had commenced business under the auspices we have noticed, and at the opening of&#xD;
this chapter he had been a year engaged in business on his own account, and with the sanguine&#xD;
disposition of youth, had extended it to an extent far beyond the capital of his firm. Still he&#xD;
had met with no losses, and everything had gone on prosperous thus far. His partner was not as&#xD;
active in business as he himself and did not devote his time so closely to it as Clarence did. He&#xD;
was a man fond of society, and more addicted'to pleasure and amusementI; so the principal ar-&#xD;
rangement fell upon Clarence. He was assisted in all his plans and operations with the advice of&#xD;
the Colonel, who rarely let a day pass.that he did not visit the counting-room of Lee &amp;amp; Bolton, in&#xD;
Broad street. Mrs. Bolton, the mother of Clarence, did not like the arrangement at all. Her&#xD;
son was so engrossed in business night and day, and so mixed up with politics, that she rarely&#xD;
had a chance to have those long and sociable conversations of the olden times. But still she made&#xD;
every allowance, and consoled herself with the reflection that it would not last long; that as busi-&#xD;
ness prospered with her son and his commercial firm, that he would-have more time to devote te&#xD;
.her. How little do mothers or any kind of other women know-about the cravingss of a bnan o*&#xD;
business! It increases with age, and the More business a merchant does, the more he is anx-&#xD;
ious to do. His ambition to do inlarge and successful business is more eager than that of the'states-&#xD;
man, or, the man-with a profession, to rise to the head of it. But with the merchant such an am-&#xD;
bition is destructive to all domestic comfort, and in almost every case, ruinous to his own financial&#xD;
prospects ; for success makes him more venturesome, and, like the successful gambler, he increases&#xD;
and doubled his steaks, until some sudden and unlocked for stroke of bad fortune destroys all his&#xD;
plans, and renders him at one blow a bankrupt and a beggar. Very few merchants at-e content&#xD;
to do a slow, sure and certain business. Nearly all are anxious to increase it and make as much&#xD;
money as they can, and even when they have far exceeded their opening desires, they find they&#xD;
have but commenced to do the business or made the fortune they desired to make. It was a pros-&#xD;
perous time when Clarence and the young Lee commenced their business, and with the influence&#xD;
of the Elder Lee, and with his advice to guide them, the first few months of their existence was&#xD;
extremely prosperous, and Clarence had made more money in the first six months that he was in&#xD;
business than he had ever dreapied he should be worth  His ambition began to be excited, and&#xD;
he longed to extend his business connexions and to create as much of a sensation on 'change as&#xD;
some of his older mercantile friends created. He consulted his own views and those of his partner,&#xD;
who coincided with, him in everything, much more than he did in those of the elder Mr. Lee.- The&#xD;
latter r egarded Clarence almost as dearly as he did his own son, and frequently cautioned to him&#xD;
the danger of going ahead too fast; but Clarence possessed great logical powers, and after one of&#xD;
those cautionary fits of old Mr. Lee, he would explain to him so clearly the certainty of success&#xD;
in any new enterprise in which he was desirous the firm should embark, that the old gentleman&#xD;
would be forced to give hiS consent, and-the funds to carry out the mercantile idea; Thus were&#xD;
matters situal ed when Clarence first dreamed of accepting a nomination for the State Legislature,&#xD;
but when he spoke to old Mr. Lee about it, that shrewd old merchant was so horrified at it, that&#xD;
Clarence determined to say no more .until he was actually nominated, and then to tell his old&#xD;
friend he couldn't help it.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
COXrENTS-Ciarence elected to the Legislature--his career therein highly creditable-his partner travels-Mr. Lee and&#xD;
famly-his mother,. &amp;amp;e.&#xD;
UANTITY is one essential ingredient to make&#xD;
a good sized work, but quality is still more es-&#xD;
-   sential to make a readable one-and the more&#xD;
particularly in a tale like this, which..is read .&#xD;
-__-                        chapter by chapter every week by thousands.&#xD;
] Knowing this fact, it has been our aim as we have&#xD;
-~~__                         progressed to throw into it portions that would&#xD;
~n_ interest all and each individual reader, no matter&#xD;
to what class of society he or she might belong.&#xD;
We have brought our young friend Clarence to&#xD;
--       --    an interesting part in his history  He is estab-&#xD;
lished as a merchant, and although this class&#xD;
generally speaking have very little ambition to&#xD;
be anything else but merchants, there are fre-&#xD;
quently found exceptions among theim, and some&#xD;
-  shine as men of literature, and others rise to&#xD;
political eminence.' But the latter is rarely the&#xD;
case. It is a singular fact that since the days of&#xD;
the Revolution, there are few merchants who&#xD;
have ever distinguished themselves as legislators or statesmen. It would actually strike any one&#xD;
that our merchants would be the representatives to the Legislature and to Congress from our com-&#xD;
mercial seaboard cities ; yet it is rarely the case, and more particularly in the great commercial&#xD;
mart of this continent, and the reason here is obvious. The merchants, as a body, attend to their&#xD;
business and money making, and do not understand the first rudiments of political advancement&#xD;
Now and then it becomes the interest of a few politicians, who' do understand the ropes, to have a&#xD;
merchant nominated to Congress, and then the city of New York has a King or Grinnell in the&#xD;
Hall at Washington. There is not at this moment in the city of New York as much of any political&#xD;
party who has sufficient personal influence to procure a nomination to Congress from either party,&#xD;
or who would know how to go to work to get it, unless by depending upon a few political suckers,&#xD;
who would spend his money to secure a nomination, and if the party in the district where he&#xD;
lived was strong enough he would go in. A merchant knows very little about the complicg ted&#xD;
machinery of primary meetings, the source of all political power in this State, and therefore is&#xD;
at the mercy-of those who do, and they can make or unmake him -at their pleasure.&#xD;
In the days of which we write, the nominations of the democratic party were made at that great&#xD;
building known as Tammany Hall. It was not then managed as it is now. Committees met in&#xD;
that old building, and nominated the members of Congress from the whole city, and the members&#xD;
of the Legislature in a batch. Now each district elect a committee for each ward at a primary&#xD;
meeting, and they nominate the member to represent that Congressional, Legislative, or Senato-&#xD;
rial district.&#xD;
A young lawyer, who has determined to shine in the political sky, if he consults his eventual&#xD;
success, will commence his political career at the bottom of the ladder. He becomes in his own&#xD;
ward a member of the young men's vigilance committee, when he becomes somewhat extensively&#xD;
acquainted with those men, he is put forward as a member of the ward committee,; he then has a&#xD;
chance to work himself into most of the dominating committees, in favor of those who tire ahead&#xD;
of him, and finally goes down to Tammany as a member of the Young Men's General Committee,&#xD;
and after serving ihiis apprenticeship-for some time, he, as a matter of course, has become pretty&#xD;
extensively acquainted with all the active politicians ofhis own party in the town, and has ac-&#xD;
quired a sufliient capital to do a little trading on his own hook, and stand a chance of getting&#xD;
his name before the people for a vote for any office of emolumen t or honor that he may select-.&#xD;
Such was theposition of oui' friend Clarence. He had made himself useful to his political friends&#xD;
in all these capacities, and besides the leading active politician of his native ward, 'the old KEle-&#xD;
venth, knew him well personally, and had known the elder Bolton, and regarded his son with es-&#xD;
pecial 'favor, No sooner did it became tinown that Clarence would accept a nomination for the&#xD;

Assembly, than an old rat of a wire puller came to him, and with the frankness of one of his class,&#xD;
thus addressed Wim&#xD;
"So Clarence you want to go to Albany this winter ?"&#xD;
"Well, I was thinking of it. Do y ou thit k there would be a chance of my being elected ?"&#xD;
4 Elected ? that has got nothing to do with it. To get nominated youmean ?"&#xD;
"Well, nominated then."&#xD;
"Yes, there is a good chance. We have got no candidate from this ward, and it is a very easy&#xD;
thing to get a delegation that will go for you heart and soul; and now I -think of it, you would&#xD;
make a first rate member. I'll go on the nominating committee from this ward myself, and as,&#xD;
certain that all the rest of it will go their death for you."&#xD;
"But that will be only fiVe, and there are fifty odd members of the nominating committee from&#xD;
other wards."&#xD;
'' Oh,Aon't bother your head about that. There are several other members besides yourself to&#xD;
be nominated, and a great many other affairs, so that with your own delegation true and willing&#xD;
to stand fire, we can do a little log rolling, and you are nominated sure. By the way, be on&#xD;
hand at the next ward primary meeting, act'as secretary, and don't blab-don't talk-yeu don't&#xD;
want anything -wouldn't take it. That's the way to talk until you are nominated. A few of us&#xD;
understand all about that."&#xD;
Clarence promised to follow the advice ofhis old friend, and a few days after the nominating&#xD;
committees from thq old Eleventh were all elected; among them was the old friend Clarenge had&#xD;
talked with, and four others that he knew were friendly. He took the matter quietly after this,&#xD;
until the night of themeeting of the committee at Tammany Hall. At the first meeting at the&#xD;
committee room in the old wig-wam, only the names of the candidates were proposed, and what&#xD;
was his mortification at finding his name had not even been mentioned by any of his friends who&#xD;
were on the committe from the Eleventh!&#xD;
Soon after he met Mr. G., his friend who was on the committee, and told it to him.&#xD;
" Bah !" ,was the reply, " that don't make any difference : We did it purposely. You ill be&#xD;
one of the first four names nominated ; it is all arranged. Don't say any more about it."&#xD;
A few mornings after, when Clarence took up the morning paper, his name was stlte third on the&#xD;
list of candidates, nominated at Tammany Hall for the Assembly. Before twelve o'clock of the&#xD;
same day that this announcement appeared, Mr. Lee, the father of his partner, called at the cont&#xD;
ing-room, and in s. very grave and serious manner requested topiee Clarence alone. The latter&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7713-00000043"/>&#xD;
Ii&#xD;
II      84&#xD;
&#xD;
took the old gentleman to the back part of the store, when the following conversation occurred:&#xD;
"Well, Clarence, I see that you have been nominated at old Tammany Hall as one of the can-&#xD;
didates for the Legislature. Of course it has been done without your consent, and you -will de-&#xD;
cline the nomination."&#xD;
"Really, Mr. Lee, I don't well see how I can do that, now that I am before the people for elec-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"True; but it hits not bepn done with your consent, and you can easily tell them so, and that&#xD;
you will not, under any circumstances, be a candidate."h&#xD;
There was a smile on the face of Clarence at the idea suggested by his venerable friend, of his&#xD;
being a candidate without his consent, as if such things were done at Tammany Hall as nomina-&#xD;
ting a man for any office whatever without his consent. He did not correct the etror, but merely&#xD;
observed:&#xD;
"I fear, sir, I must let the matter rest as it is. What objection can you possibly urge against&#xD;
*  my becoming a member of the Legislature, if I am elected ?"&#xD;
"1What objection? Why, you surprise me, Clarence! What objection to a young merchant's&#xD;
neglecting his legitimate business, to embark in the sea of politics ? Why, your credit and stand-&#xD;
ing as a merchant would be ruined forever."&#xD;
"1I do not see any reason why such should be the case. The position is an honorable one, and I&#xD;
can easily spare a few weeks from my business without injuring it. Besides, sir, I want to do&#xD;
something in the Legislature. I have a special object in going there. I wish to see a law  abol-&#xD;
Ished, and to aid in procuring its erasure from the statute books."&#xD;
"And pray what law is that which you feel so interested in ?"&#xD;
" The law which provides for the imprisonment of debtors, and which places 'a poor man who&#xD;
may owe a few dollars, in the power of the man to whom he may chance to owe the sum. That&#xD;
law I want to see repealed, and it would give me great satisfaction to give my personal aid and&#xD;
vote to have it repealed."&#xD;
"Worse'and worse, Clarence. It is a good law. What motive can you haye to get it repealed?&#xD;
Do you expect to be a poor man ? Why, it is a very just law, and a very useful one. How would&#xD;
I ever be able to collect money due me, but for that law ?"&#xD;
"1We will not discuss that matter now, sir. If you will convince me that any harm can arise&#xD;
to my firm in any way whatever from my accepting a seat in the Legislature, I will cause my&#xD;
name to be withdrawn."&#xD;
"Why, have I told you what harm'will arise; your credit will be ruined. It is a bad sign for&#xD;
a merchant to be a politician."&#xD;
"It may be so; but I think it would be better for the country at large if the merchants would&#xD;
devote more of their time to politics than they do. Every merchant should know his own busi-&#xD;
ness at least, and if he can leave it for a season, he ought to do so, and give some of his commer-&#xD;
cial sagacity and experience to his country. My mind is madeup, and I don't think I will with-&#xD;
draw my name."&#xD;
"1Clarence, I hope you will think better of it. You are very young. Wait a few years, and&#xD;
then if you see fit, why embark in politics; but don't do it now. You will regret it."&#xD;
"I think not, sir. Let me have my way this once. It can do no great harm, and if I find harm&#xD;
does arise from it, 1 have only a few weeks to be absent, and then I will be more devoted to busi-&#xD;
ness than ever before.,     .&#xD;
Mr. Lee partly assented, although not pleased, and left Clarence, hoping that his own good,&#xD;
sense and a little reflection would cause him to leave, the politics alone.. Colonel Vanderhoost, who&#xD;
knew the motives that actuated his young friend, did not oppose or second his design. He quietly&#xD;
observed thAt *ater would find its own level, and so would Clarence. The three days of election&#xD;
arrived, and when they were over Clarence and his party had carried all before them. He was&#xD;
elected by a handsome majority, The interval between the election and the first of January&#xD;
following, when hewould take his seat, was devoted to his business, and his partner, ypung Lee&#xD;
He made him aoquainted with all his business plans, and felt that he could safely entruct the&#xD;
operations of the house to his charge; but he little dreamed at the moment what cost it would be.&#xD;
Clarence had supposed that his mother would of course go with him to Albany, and remain there&#xD;
during the session. This she refused to do, much to his disappointment ; but she could not be&#xD;
persuaded to alter her siind.&#xD;
" I dlo note like to change, Clarence," said she. " You may desert the old c'atasge, but I will ncs&amp;amp;&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
85&#xD;
&#xD;
There I have dwelt for many years, of happiness as well as of sorrow, and there I intend to remain&#xD;
until I die."&#xD;
&#xD;
Her determination could not be altered, although Colonel Vanderhoost himself tried to change&#xD;
her mind.&#xD;
We will not go into the. details of the proceedings of the Legislature at Albany during that&#xD;
session., The subject in which Clarence felt so deep ansinterest had been agitated in the'previous&#xD;
Legislatures, and was discussed shcrtly after Clarence took his seat. He took the subject up at&#xD;
once, and in private and in public on every ,occasion, used his voice and influence to procure the&#xD;
passage of a b'll abolishing the' odious law. It succeeded, and before he returned to his native&#xD;
city the hill was passed, and there was no longer imprisonment for debt in his native State. . Du-&#xD;
ring ,he discussion, when asked (as he frequently was by members) why he felt so deeply, inter-&#xD;
ested in its fate, he made no direct reply, but simply narrated some of the events in his early&#xD;
career, and told the story of the incarcer nation of his father in the old jail in the city. That was&#xD;
enough. It made more converts to his cause than mere logical arguments could have done. Af-&#xD;
ter-the adjournment of the Legislature in the spring, he returned to New.York afnd devoted his&#xD;
whole energies to mercantile business. He found that his inexperienced partner had entered into&#xD;
a great many very large and extended-operations, and he for the first time began to be alarmed&#xD;
and to regret that he should have left th3 counting room, far a week even to enterZ the political&#xD;
field, and -he asked and obtained an interview with the elder Lee, and explained to him fully the&#xD;
extent of the mercantile combinations which the son had entered into while he himself had been&#xD;
legislating at Albany. The old merchant had been gratieid at the position which dlarence had&#xD;
achieved in the Legislature, and frahkly told him so; but added:&#xD;
"Now, Clarence, I am glad to perceive that you think my son has been somewhat imprudent.&#xD;
It only shows you how necessary it is for a man, a merchantpartieularly, . to devote his whole&#xD;
time aud attention wholly to his occupation. You are more to blame than my son. Had you&#xD;
been here he would not have increased the business as he has done, and very imprudently. How-&#xD;
ever, if you will only quit politics, all will go well. It was a great era in the life of young men&#xD;
like you and my son when you commenced business. You had got through your tedious clerk-&#xD;
ship-you more particularly had become a merchant, with a fair chance of succeeding as one.&#xD;
You, like a great many others, did not think that the pleasant position you found yourself in was&#xD;
and is fraught with danger and peril to your future prospects; for I assure you, Clarence, mer-&#xD;
cantile firms that have commenced business in New York for forty years that I can remember&#xD;
back, not one out of every ten have exis ted ten years, not one in thirty have lasted twenty years,&#xD;
not one in fifty have lasted thirty years, and not one in all have lasted forty years. The firms so&#xD;
started have failed, suspended. changed, or ceased to exist. Those that are started under the&#xD;
most auspicious circumstances, with a heavy capital and strong resources, have often ended nhost&#xD;
disastrously; while many that started with' nothing, have succeeded, made a fortune- and retired&#xD;
contented. I am one. No merchant who has continued in business has kept a fortune, and died&#xD;
leaving one. Now, I will go to your counting-room, arrange your affairs for you, assist you with&#xD;
money to conduct to a successful termination such operations as my son has put afloat which re-&#xD;
quires the aid of capital, and do you promise me to advise with me for the future and above all&#xD;
to leave politics. By the way, my son has suggested to me that by going abroad he could influ-,&#xD;
ence a large amount of commission business to the concern, and as Iregard that as a very safe&#xD;
business, I see no objections to his plan, and if you have none, I will arrange so that he can go&#xD;
out on the best footing,"&#xD;
Clar en6e gladly availed himself of the kind offer of as sistance and advice from the old merchant,&#xD;
and everything was arranged pleasantly.. The son went abroad as had been proposed, and Clar-&#xD;
ence became more'intimate with the family of Mr. Lee than ever he had been before; for that&#xD;
family consisted of Mr. Lee, his wife, son, and a daughter who was in her fifteenth year, a very&#xD;
lovely giil, just verging into womanhood. Under the superintendence of Mr. Lee, the business&#xD;
of the firm became very prosperous and very successful, and the old gentleman was as regular in&#xD;
his attendance at the counting-room as if he had never left business, and so matters continued&#xD;
S for a year after Clarence returned from Albany. The health of his mothers no better,' and&#xD;
she was now confined solely to her own .residence; and the more helpless she became, the nmore&#xD;
constant and devoted was his attendance upon her, and when h~e was necessarily absent from her&#xD;
room, his presence was supplied by that of the gentle Mary Lee, who hardly let a day pass that&#xD;
she was niot at thie house of Mrs. Boltozz.&#xD;

CONTENTS-Merchants, what constitutes one,-transactions of the frrm of Lee &amp;amp; Bolton, &amp;amp;0.&#xD;
JCOLLECTIONS of our own mercantile career&#xD;
will hover about us as we take up the pen to&#xD;
continue our story, and we will devote one chap-&#xD;
ter to merchants.&#xD;
What is a merchant? There are thousands so&#xD;
'designated in our great cities, and the term is&#xD;
an indefinite one. In the country they call a&#xD;
merchant an individual who keeps a "store,"&#xD;
buys and selI merchandise of all kinds, include.&#xD;
ing needles, crockery, calico, earthen pots,thread,&#xD;
sugar, jews-harps, and penknifes; and a New&#xD;
York merchant, in the eyes of rural people, is&#xD;
the men who buys and sells goods, no'matter&#xD;
whether it is a pound of tea and cotton-wick in a&#xD;
corner grocery in the Eleventh Ward, or the&#xD;
man in South street who owns a line of packets&#xD;
or imports a cargo of teas a month.&#xD;
A merchant, according to our ideas, is that&#xD;
man who operates on his owg account; who&#xD;
sends his ships to India or other ports, and im ports cargoes; who ships our great staples oz&#xD;
cotton, tobacco, &amp;amp;c., abroad; who imports foreign merchandise or sella it in large quantities, either&#xD;
on his or other people's account-in fact, who goes into operations that require experience,&#xD;
judicious management, foresight, or calculation. The firm  of Lee &amp;amp; Bolton was nominally a&#xD;
"commission house ;" that is, they received consignments of merchandise which they sold on com-&#xD;
mission for a stated per contage foi their trouble. It was the wish of Mr. 'Lee that his son should&#xD;
confine the operations of the firm to this legitimate and (with ordinary prudence) a safe business.&#xD;
As the commission merchant who sells goods runs very little risk unless he charges a guarantee&#xD;
commission of two and one-half per cent. where he sells on time, and if he does this, even if he&#xD;
does lose a few dollars now and then, yet-at the end of the year he generally finds that he has&#xD;
received more on guarantee commissions charged to his correspondents than he has lost by bad&#xD;
failures; consequently he makes a profit, unless there should be some great mercantile convulsion,&#xD;
or unless he has.been very incautious in selling the merchandise consigned to him to people in&#xD;
bad credit. When Lee &amp;amp; Bolton commenced business it was their intention to do this sort of&#xD;
business, and to give our readers some idea how an extensive commercial firm commence their&#xD;
operations, or rather to show the beginning, we will go back to the time when the partnership&#xD;
was formed. Oh the first of January, 18-, the day and month when they started, they had&#xD;
abundance of capital and credit, and a list of correspondents in different ports of the world'and&#xD;
parts of the United States, and to many of these Mr. Lee, senior, wrote, soliciting their influence&#xD;
for his son To all of these correspondents the following circular, printed on a half sheet of letter&#xD;
paper, was forwarded by the sailing packets and transient vessels of those days:&#xD;
"NEW YORK, Jan'y 1, 1-,&#xD;
SiR-We have the pleasure of informing you that we have this day established ourselves in&#xD;
this city for the purpose of transacting a General Commiosion Business, and in making a tender&#xD;
of our services in this market, would crave reference to the following persons.&#xD;
We are, very respectfully, your obedient servants,&#xD;

There were references enough to have done busineEs sufficient to employ a capital for a few mil-&#xD;
lions, but the parties to whom these circulars solicited business was sent, did not avail themselves&#xD;
of the kind offer at once, and, in order to keep capital employed, young Lee built a ship, and in&#xD;
sixty days from the time the keel was laid, she was ready to be launched. Young Lee had.no par&#xD;
&#xD;
ticular trade to place her in, but he knew very well that a new ship could always get a freight&#xD;
somewhere when the ship was once built. He had some trouble to get his father's approval of the&#xD;
operation, but at last he succeeded by the exercise of some considerable ingenuity. He named her&#xD;
after his fatherand the old gentleman did not see any good reason why a ship should not be&#xD;
named after him, as well as after meaner men, and consented, and aided the son to carry out the&#xD;
idea, and he even sent an invitation to Clarence to come and see her launched. Clarence was sur-&#xD;
prised at his partner's boldness; but as his individual capital was not involved, he left the mat-&#xD;
ter entirely to the discretion of his partner and the elder Lee.&#xD;
A freight was found for the ship, and it was on'the occasion of her departure from this port on&#xD;
her first voyage to a foreign port, that Clarence came down from Albany, and with his Partner&#xD;
and their friends went down to Sandy Hook, and then returned to town in a steamboat.&#xD;
&#xD;
That day was a proud one for the two young merchants. They felt themselves to be ship-owners,&#xD;
and of'some account on 'change, and Clarence returned to Albany, more infected with the love of&#xD;
merchandise-than with politics.&#xD;
i There were several other extended operations, into which young Lee had rushed the new firm,&#xD;
besides the shipping business. He had soon, after the firm commenced, bought up all the eats that&#xD;
could be found in the market, with the idea that the North River would freeze over, and that oats&#xD;
would go up, and his father said he was mad, when the son told him what he had done. But young&#xD;
merchants are sometimes as shrewd as old ones, when they get a crotchet in their heads, and it&#xD;
proved so in this case, for the river did close; -oats advanced fifteen cents a bushel, and the new&#xD;
firm made a handsome sum of money, and that induced young Lee to embarlk in other operations&#xD;
without consulting his father, who had showed he didn't understand "oat."  Not long after that&#xD;
speculation, some philanthropic broker suggested to the active partner that pepper was getting&#xD;
scarce in this market, and would probably advance in price tee immediately went into pepper,&#xD;
and invested $10,000 in that article, and it did rise, and before a month he sold out at an advance ot&#xD;
two cents per pound, leaving a profit of $3,500.- This was doing a pretty smart business for so.&#xD;
short a time, and a great many older firms gave the young house credit for extraordinary sagacity.&#xD;
But these operations were not all There were'others of a larg er amount that young Lee had en-&#xD;
tered into, which were not so profitable'; in fact, they were not closed up when Clarence returned.&#xD;
from Albany, and eten when they were-after the elder Mr. Lee began ta take an active part in&#xD;
the business-after his son had gone to Europe, they turned out to be very losing operations, ind'&#xD;
the firm sunk about as much as they had previously made.&#xD;
When Clarence had entirely regained the confidence of old Mr. Lee, the latter became less fre.&#xD;
quent in visiting the counting room of the-firm, and Clarence was obliged to act more on his o n&#xD;
&#xD;
air-&#xD;
&#xD;

V&#xD;
&#xD;
responsibility, and h' became as anxious to do a larger business, as his partner had been nearly a&#xD;
year previous. and even Colonel Vanderhoost began to think of doing business, and turning his&#xD;
acquaintances into a useful channel  The store of Lee and Bolton was a large one, and Clarence&#xD;
made an office for'the Colonel, and made an agreement with him to do a wine business. Clarence&#xD;
Was to import wines of all kinds, and the Colonel was to dispose of them to his fastidious acquaint-&#xD;
ai ces about town.- No sooner was Mr. Lee, who was in France, informed of this than he began&#xD;
.o make arrangements to carry it into effect, and the first operation was to make a contract with a&#xD;
house in Rheims to send to the New.York market a thousand baskets of champagne per month,&#xD;
but luckily only one thousand were shipped, and on this shipment alone the firm lost nearly three&#xD;
dollars-a basket, and the elder Lee then interfered, and no more was shipped.&#xD;
Among the enterprises in which Clarence engaged, was one which from its singularity we will&#xD;
speak of more at length, as it involved consequences most disastrous to his firm. By prudence&#xD;
they had succeeded during the first two years that the firm had been in existence, and by the efforts&#xD;
of the elder Lee at home, and of the younger one abroad, in getting up a good and reliable com-&#xD;
mission business.&#xD;
We have said before, that the object of young Lee's mission to Europe was to procure business.&#xD;
Previous to his departure, letters of instruction, letters of credit, and letters of introduction, were&#xD;
furnished him in abundance. The main object of hiq visit was to procure business, such as agen-&#xD;
cies for foreign houses, consignments of vessels and merohandize, and when it was necessary, he&#xD;
had power to use his letters of credit to make advances on any such consignments where advances&#xD;
were required by parties disposed to ship merchandize to the firms in New York. He was suc-&#xD;
cessful, and large consignments were made, and funds used on the London and Paris credits to&#xD;
make advonces.&#xD;
Notwithstanding Mr Lee had regained confidence after daily witnessing Clarence's manage-&#xD;
ment, he frequently offered advice, but when he found that it began to jar upon the young mer-&#xD;
chant's feelings,Jie ceased to do so, unless it was solicited, particularly by the latter, which rarely&#xD;
happened. When he saw the firm connecting themselves with Colonel Vanderhoost, he did not like&#xD;
it, and remonstrated, giving as a reason, that it was scattering the capital of the firm upon a com-&#xD;
plicated business. Still the kindest feelings existed, and Clarence daily visited the old merchant's&#xD;
family, and saw Mary once or twice every day.&#xD;
The ship, named after Mr. Lee, went her voyage to Europe, and returned to New York with a&#xD;
very small freight, and oh making up her accounts, Clarence found that she had invested a large&#xD;
amount of capital, which would be more profitably used in other purposes, and he found that he,&#xD;
was very much cramped. He had to remit money constantly for the drafts drawn by young Lee&#xD;
in Europe, to make advances, or run the risk of injuring their credit and standing with the Lon-&#xD;
don or Paris firms. Young Lee's expenses personally'had been very large, and Clarence wrote&#xD;
him constantly, urging him to make the most strenuous exertions, and to send the firm as much&#xD;
European business as could by any possibility be obtained.  It was time now for a new voyage to&#xD;
be madecup for the ship, but Clarence had half a mind to sell her for what she would bring, rather&#xD;
than have her go again to sea with so much cash capital as she cost locked up. le was not even&#xD;
disposed to tell the exact state of his affairs to the elder Mr. Lee; that gentleman had his own,&#xD;
financial affairs to attend to, and from being well conversant with the general operations of the&#xD;
young firm, while he superintended them afterthe departure of his son for Europe, and the return&#xD;
of Clarence from Albany, he had no doubt but everything  was going on prosperously and welt.&#xD;
He had signed Custom House bonds and endorsed notes for the firm without asking any questions&#xD;
when he did so. He knew that they were getting considerable West 1Idia business, consignments&#xD;
of sugars, &amp;amp;c., and that it was us1l for importing merchants to have an endorser on such paper&#xD;
as they signed for Custom House duties The extended-business of the firm and the separated and&#xD;
out up state of their bona ide capital required that they should have more, and Clarence regretted&#xD;
that he had ever invested a dollar in the business of ship owning. It was so much money looked&#xD;
up, and he consulted the elder Lee on one occasion, and told him that he thought of selling the&#xD;
ship while she was in port, and before she commenced another voyage.&#xD;
" What ? sell the ' Lee' ?" he exclaimed. " Why, my death Clarence, what are you thinking&#xD;
of? A new firm sell the first ship they. ever owned, and when she has only made one voyage !&#xD;
Oh, no; that will never do at all. It would ruin your credit, and she would not sell for anything&#xD;
like what she cost. Oh, no ; that must not be. How much money do you want, Clarence, to carry&#xD;
jon through all your difficulties ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, I suppose we shall not have need of more than twenty thousand dollars. We can afford&#xD;
to lay out of the balance. She has cost us over that."&#xD;
"What is the amount of the bonds I have signed for you at the Custom House ?"&#xD;
"Oh, that is all right. I do not know the exact amount, but we shall take them all up when&#xD;
they become due."&#xD;
"I should hope so. But what is the amount of these bonds, as near as you can recollect ?"&#xD;
"I should think it was over nine thousand dollars."&#xD;
"1Well, Clarence, you may make out a bill of sale to me of the ship Lee, and let the register be&#xD;
taken out in my name. Insure her for twenty-four thousand dollars, aid with this understand-&#xD;
ing: You are to conduct all the operations of the ship precisely as if she were your own and still&#xD;
under yeur control I will sign all letters and orders in regard to her, and you may draw them&#xD;
as you please. I shall charge you seven per cent. interest, and will give you a letter of what I&#xD;
shall advance you with the interest on it, as paid by you or by the vessel's earniings, which must&#xD;
come into my hands, I will give you a bill of sale back again. But if you fail te do this, then I&#xD;
will sell her as if she was my own property"&#xD;
"I am agreed," replied Clarence, "and the amount you propose will answer every require-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
"1Now, Clarence, listen to me still further. This and other operations have very much stag-&#xD;
gered my confidence in you as merchants. I am a careful, prudent man. I would not advance&#xD;
you a dollar on the ship, save for two reasons. One is, you have named her after me; and I don't&#xD;
want my name under the circumstances put up for sale. It has pleased my daughter. She feels&#xD;
very grateful that you and her brother named a shipafter me, and it would mortify her very&#xD;
much to see a favored object of interest to her put out of your hands ; and having become fully&#xD;
aware of the state of the case, I am willing to do what I propose. Therefore, say nothing to her&#xD;
in regard to this transaction. Let her suppose that the ship and your ether mercantile matters&#xD;
are going on as swimmingly as possible; but at the same time,'I wish you to understand me dis-&#xD;
inotly when Isay henceforth, business is business between us; and whenever I sign any note, or&#xD;
bond, or obligation, &amp;amp;c., and aid with cash or any manner whatever, I shall require the same&#xD;
collateral security from your firm as I would if my son was not one of your firm. Now pursue&#xD;
your own course. I will advise you whenever you solicit advice from me; but as for cash assist-&#xD;
ance, I shall not give it  I have given my son a capital, and if it should belost, it is a matter&#xD;
between you and him. Now, do we distinctly understand each other ?"&#xD;
"4I understand you perfectly, dear sir, and will try dnd curtail our business, and not lo8k up&#xD;
our capital in the manner we have done  We have not really made a loss since we commenced ;&#xD;
for we have made, as you are aware, a great deal of money by some operations, although we have&#xD;
lost money by others."&#xD;
"Yes, Clarence, I know you have made money by some of your operations; but still these same&#xD;
operations may prove of injury to you by leading you astray into an uncertain and very hazardous&#xD;
business, and-you may engage in similar operations which may turn out very differently. I hope&#xD;
not; but I again reiterate my advice to you to obtain a certain, reliable commission, business. If&#xD;
you make money, then invest it in any operation you please. Your building the ship may all&#xD;
have been very well planned and executed; still that is not the thing. You have looked up capi-&#xD;
tal that you now really require in other business which you have undertaken, and now I will&#xD;
bid you good night, but will add before we part, that .while I disapprove of your business transac-&#xD;
tions, ,1 am satisfied that a little prudence will remedy the evil. Call on me to-morrow for the&#xD;
money I have promised'you."&#xD;
Wheq Mr. Lee had gone, Clarence reflected very deeply upon the kind advice he had received.&#xD;
"le is right, and I am wrong. What wild spirit suggested my partner or myself the idea of&#xD;
building a ship? I already begin to feelthe effects of it, and to be very much cramped. However&#xD;
the promised loan will put me all snug, and I will be more careful in future."&#xD;

CHAPTER        XIX,&#xD;
CONTENTS-The Arm of Lee &amp;amp; Bolton teoomes prospetous-Mary Lee-death of Mrs.. Bolton, &amp;amp;0.&#xD;
T will naturally-occur to the reader how ne-&#xD;
cessary it is to have experience in' the counting&#xD;
rooms, and its dependencies, and how much may&#xD;
_ __be lost even unde propitious beginnings, if not&#xD;
assisted by the advice of those who havelong trav-&#xD;
eled through the mazy intricacies of mercantile&#xD;
affairs. The impetuosity of youth leads them too&#xD;
oftento rush heedlessly on a course, which, if&#xD;
not averted, only ends in disappointment and re-&#xD;
gret. Thus was it with Clarence and the younger&#xD;
Lee, while old Mr. Lee watched after their inter-&#xD;
ests, and, where it could be done, gave from time&#xD;
to time such advice as, if profited by, would&#xD;
heal up the mismanagement of the young mer-&#xD;
chants.&#xD;
Clarence, now ripening into years, saw the&#xD;
necessity of being better informed in his profes-&#xD;
61       sional pursuits, and that the advice proffered by&#xD;
the elder Lee, instead of being, as formerly, a&#xD;
source of uneasiness, now proved like oil poured upon the troubled waters; and with that self de-&#xD;
nial of his own opinion, gave more heed to Mr. Lee's advice than formerly. The next interview&#xD;
was, indeed, an altered one.; and as Mr. Lee handed over the necessary funds to make all straight,&#xD;
Olarpnce thanked him not even so much for the pecuniary assistance, as for the treasured informa-&#xD;
-mation vhich accompanied the one thing needful.&#xD;
Clarence now saw that, as far as he was individually concerned, he had profited by experience,&#xD;
and resolved' at once to direct his energies in the only true course to obtain success. He immedi-&#xD;
ately wrote to his partner in Europe on the subject, giving him such a detail as astonished the&#xD;
,younger Lee, entreating him not to be so wild in speculation, and offering advice to his partner,&#xD;
showing clearly that a change had "come o'er the spirit of his dream," and that he was now on&#xD;
the rteal road to wealth and fame.&#xD;
Our Hero was not without' reflecting on the time and opportunities lost, which could not be re-&#xD;
called, in his eagerness to become a public character; and now began to see, that althoughhe&#xD;
had achieved some celebrity in the legislature, still it was perfectly unstable, and that the multi-&#xD;
tad4 who cheered him on one day to the pinnacle of fame, were the next liable to turn round, and&#xD;
defame the'persen they so hitherto applauded; proving the absurdity, in one sense, however, 6f&#xD;
the " vog populi vox Dei." Accordingly, he now devoted his entire attention to lAs private af-&#xD;
fairs, and with some favorable remarks from his .partner in Europe, held out to himself some&#xD;
flattering assurances of his prosperity "in futuro."&#xD;
We must now leave him in his altered course for a short time, while we relieve our readers by&#xD;
giving them some information on Mr. Lee, seniorjand his household. He also had written a&#xD;
letter to his son, giving him the best possible advice; while Mary Lee was continuing to evolve&#xD;
froin the chrysalis, and become a belleof the first magnitude. Mr. Lee had spared no expense&#xD;
upon the education of his daughter, and after the real education in housekeeping, so characteris-&#xD;
tic of the American ladies, had been effected, had no objection that his daughter should acquire&#xD;
those refinements in education, which would enable her to appear in the best society without dis-&#xD;
advantage. She had now become a very tolerable musician, had learned those languages which&#xD;
are absolutely necessary for New York, where members of so nany different nations are min-&#xD;
gled in society; and altogether had made such improvements in every respect mentally, that her&#xD;
father, as well as her friends from without, had felt the influence she exercised over her com-&#xD;
peers in society, and 'would have gained notoriety, but for those modest ideas she had of her own&#xD;
qualifications and deserts.&#xD;
Mr. Lee w atched with anxiety every opening leaf in his daughter's 'progress, with a delight&#xD;
only understood by a fond and affectionate parent ; while thoughts would often occur to him. how&#xD;
lie could make sure that all things would uznite to make that lovely child escape the ills mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
is subject to; and these reflections he could'not entertain without a fervent hope in the future.&#xD;
It is not to be supposed that the amiable, lovely, and accomplished daughter of Mr. Lee would&#xD;
long appear in public, without'making impressions on the other sex, who had the goid fortune to&#xD;
be cast in her society, and every day brought new suitors to-her shrine ; nor is0it to be under-&#xD;
stood that even Clarence himself was a stoic on the occasion; while the circumstance of his&#xD;
being thrown so much into the society of the fascinating Mary Lee, only tended to enhance her&#xD;
value in his eyes.&#xD;
At the period we now write, New York was in the very height of the most fashionable season,&#xD;
and of course Mr. Lee's family was much sought after, from circumstances already detailed  It&#xD;
was on one of those occasions when Mr. Lee and his household, accompanied by Clarence and Co-&#xD;
lonel Vanderhoof, had accepted an invitation to the dinner table of a friend  They had all left&#xD;
home in spirits and delight; Mr. Lee happy in the idea that his son, then in foreign land, was&#xD;
likely to improve in his affairs: that he had occular demonstration that Clarence was on the real&#xD;
road to wealth and fame; and thet last, though not least, his darling child was every where so&#xD;
honored and approved of-the whole bringing satisfaction to his heart. It was with these feel-&#xD;
ings they left home to enjoy the evening.&#xD;
How true it is that such are the vicissitudes of life, that we know not momentarily what may be-&#xD;
fal us; that the sun that now shines forth In all its lustre, may in a moment be obscured, and&#xD;
black and thickening clouds take the place of smiling sunshine. Such was the case with the par-&#xD;
ties Dow under consideration. They had left home with buoyant spirits, little dreaming how soon&#xD;
their happiness was to be marred. Scarcely had the party described gained their friend's house,&#xD;
when a message reached them of the sudden illness of Mrs. Bolton. She had been, as bitherto&#xD;
stated, in a declining state of health, although not supposed to be by any means so ill as to&#xD;
threaten her life. Clarence was now summoned to the bedside of his devoted parent, and was but&#xD;
ill prepared for the blow that threatened to leave him an oiphan in the world.&#xD;

an occasion like the present. A mother on the eve of eternity, calling for her darling chill, to&#xD;
impart her last words in feeble tones, directing him to the care of the God of, Heaven, ijto whose&#xD;
presence she is about to go, and ior the last time on earth whispering to him those words of ad.&#xD;
vice, for his. fuiur~e guidance, which she believes conducive to his prosperity here, and his welfare&#xD;
hereafter; while cn the other hand the child, become speechless at the.thoughts of losing his&#xD;
only earthly parent, stands aghast at the situation he is now placed in, and one thought, common&#xD;
to the lot of all fallen humanity, appears to him for the moment as an isolated case.&#xD;
Mrs. Bolton, contrary to the expectations of the faculty, now became extremely ill, and after&#xD;
an hour's consultation, the doctor's had decided that nothing could be done to save her life. She&#xD;
lay for a considerable time unconscious, except occasionally when she would rally, like the flick-&#xD;
ering light.' Clarence was now overcome  He saw his only earthly parent about to leave him&#xD;
for ever; she who had loved and fostered him from his cradle : the thoughts of which overpowered,&#xD;
him, and he sank almost lifeless by her side.&#xD;
A few sighs,soon escaped from the lips of the dying lady, and her spirit departed to Him who&#xD;
gave it.&#xD;
"How true it is the good die first, whilst those whose hearts are dry as summer dust, burn to&#xD;
the socket.-&#xD;
Clarence was now gently removed from the rooa, ahd the doctor's, fearful of the consequences&#xD;
that might ensue to his health, had him removed to Mr. Lee's.&#xD;
It is hardly necessary to say what a mournfulhouse Mr. Lee's became. The eveiniing previously&#xD;
all was joy and hilarity-now it was the houseof mourning, The still hand of death had hovered&#xD;
over the devoted family, and is an unexpected moment left a blank in the circle, never again to&#xD;
befilled up.&#xD;
We wlll not harrow up the feelings of our readersby describing the paraphernalia of a funeral&#xD;
ceremony. Suffice it to say, that Mrs. Bolton had passed through that ordeal common to the&#xD;
children of earth, and had left devoted friends to mourn the loss of one, that some of the party,&#xD;
however, coull never forget during life.&#xD;
Three months had now elapsed, when the grief of the whole circle was in some measure as.&#xD;
suaged. Time has been provided by a wise Providence to alleviate, in some measure, at all events,&#xD;
our distresses; otherwise the world could not exist; and the necessities (if life oblige us to smo -&#xD;
ther grief, and prepare for the exigencies of our own destiny.&#xD;
Clarence now having in some measure recovered, commended in double earnest to prosecute his&#xD;
business It would almost seen that emerging from his trouble, he had received a new impetus,&#xD;
and followed it up with energy and perseverance.&#xD;
W hile matters remained as thus stated, letters were received from Europe from the younger&#xD;
Lee, who from the advice hitherto given freely by his partner, had undergone a complete change.&#xD;
The wild and uncertain management he had formerly pursued was given up, and like the Phonix&#xD;
from its ashes arose a course which by perseverance could not but be satisfactory to all persons'&#xD;
with whom the firm had transactions. Their credit now was fully established, in fact, those who&#xD;
at one time doubted were now more than eager to become acquaintod with the two young mer-&#xD;
chants, and everything had the appearance of ultimate prosperity.&#xD;
As the prosperity of Clarence advanced, the ties of friendship with t he Lees became more close.&#xD;
Indeed, Miss Lee, in the absence of her brother, looked upon Clarence in the light of a brother,&#xD;
which in Clarence's breast met an equal reciprocity, his evenings almost invariably being spent&#xD;
at Mr. Lee's, where'the accomplishment of Miss Lee made the little coterie both agreeable and&#xD;
instructing, serving as a delightful relief to Clarence, after the arduous duties of the day.&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
CONTENTS-The Gould and Lee family-their clroumstanees.-death of Fanny's husband-return of young Lee, &amp;amp;e.&#xD;
HILE Clarence daily improved in his circum-&#xD;
stances, the very contrary was the case with Mr.&#xD;
Gould, who hourly saw his wealth, a if. by mat&#xD;
/04M          gic, disappearing, while his mean principles be-&#xD;
/             ing so well known, no one felt uncomfortable at a&#xD;
recital of the fact. Another calamity bad also&#xD;
fallen on him. Dresser had plunged himself&#xD;
deeper in degradation, and in a fit of mania a potu&#xD;
deserted his truly unfortunate wife. The blow&#xD;
was overwhelming so as at first to threaten the&#xD;
life of Mr. Gould, who was from its effects unable&#xD;
for a considerable time to proceed in his business.&#xD;
His affairs, consequently, became more compli-&#xD;
cated, and ruin began to stare him in the face.&#xD;
It was evident, indeed, that Mr. Gould's days&#xD;
were about being numbered. Still he held on&#xD;
with all that tenacity whiah invariably accoinpa-&#xD;
nies the latter days of the abre loving commu-&#xD;
nity.&#xD;
The old Colonel might indeed be said to be a complete Patriarch, and naturally with his age&#xD;
came also no inconsiderable share of radotage, the evident simplicity in his manners renderiig&#xD;
constant attendance on him absolutely necessary. lMr. Gould had become, in one particular at&#xD;
last, an altered man. . His love for money, to be sure, seemed to increase as his wealth diminished,&#xD;
while the pridae, which naturally swelled within him, appeared now to give way.. In place of the&#xD;
overbearing manner and contumely originally attending all his observations on the struggling&#xD;
part of the community, he was w6nt to observe'occasionally that he'did not think them so hide-&#xD;
ous; in fact, the hauteur of former days began to diminish in the exact ratio of his decreasing&#xD;
wealth. Every day,.by some fortuitous circumstance, he became poorer, and it was evident that&#xD;
unless some wonderful change came o'er the spirit of his affairs, he would soon be reduced to pov-&#xD;
erty. Mr. Gould would now for days keep his room, to ruminate over the gold which he yet pos-&#xD;
sessed, but which was soon-to depart. He made calculation after calculation, on the score of re-&#xD;
ducing his expenses, still it was apparent to himself that all this did not seem to bring about a&#xD;
better state of things.&#xD;
It was on one of his moody days, when his absence from business had created some sensation,&#xD;
that old Colonel Vanderhoost called upon him, and was shown into his study. The old veteran at&#xD;
first thought the room empty on entering, and was some minutes before he became aware that Mr.&#xD;
Gould was actually present. In one corner of the room lay an old fashioned chest, apparently&#xD;
made as strong as-iron and wood could do so. It was open; old Gould was on his knees, his hands&#xD;
turning over carefully something at the bottom  The Colonel advanced, but so intent was lould&#xD;
upon the object of his'search and admiration that he did not for a, considerable time notice the&#xD;
approach of his visitor, who calmly but intently viewed the wary miser, as he gloated over and&#xD;
worshipped the canker of men's souls.&#xD;
The Colonel's thoughts, even in this brief period, took a review of the life of the miserable old&#xD;
man, andof the certainty of his end being worse than any part of his life, At length ',r. Gould&#xD;
became conscious of his visitor, when they cordially greeted each other and became seated.&#xD;
The old miser now opened at'once in a paroxism of ill-temper at ,the course his eventful and&#xD;
miserable life was taking, almost arraigning the Providence of God for his misfortunes, while his&#xD;
attenuated visage only served to show how deeply his body had suffered from the effects of his mind.&#xD;
The Colonel, who waited patiently until Gould's excitement hadi in some measure subside d, no~w&#xD;
inquired into his affairs, but this only tended to make him more exasperated, and the Colonel found&#xD;
it necessary to change the subject, in order to lengthen his visit. It was perfectly evident at the&#xD;
same time to the visitor, that Gould's mind was by no means as stable as it formerly had been,&#xD;
and that his whole soul was absorbed in trying to increase his store, and that he had hid his tal-&#xD;
ent in a napkin in the earth, to give it to the austere Lord when he returned.&#xD;

&#xD;
,The furniture of the apartment also showed evident alienation of mind. The regularity in the&#xD;
arrangements visible hitherto had given way to a system which elucidated the definition of chance,&#xD;
and by the confusion in which all things were in, demonstrated that chance was a series of cir-&#xD;
eumstknces without order and regularity.&#xD;
The Colonel now saw ibat the time had gone by fox ever for gaining any asendency over the&#xD;
unfortunate victim of the dross of this world, andafter a short time spnut in reverie, rose to de-&#xD;
,part. Gould now seemed to feel his unhappy situation, and appeared to be struggling against his&#xD;
fate; but, alas! the golden aker had gnawed too deeply into his soul, and he again gave- him-&#xD;
Oelf up, both body and soul, to the root of all evil, while the good old Colonel departed&#xD;
&#xD;
W,ben the young man addressed the Son of Man to settle a dispute about propertybetween him&#xD;
and his brother, he rejected the idea altogether, but wanted, at the same time, that he should go,&#xD;
sell all he had, give it to the poor, and follow him, but the young man went away very sorrowful,&#xD;
as he had much wealth, realizing the following beautiful description of all such persons, namely,&#xD;
"And Demas has forsake en Mne, having loved this present evil world."&#xD;
No sooner had the Colonel gone than old Gould again repaired to the phest, counting the spark-&#xD;
ling pieces from one side 'to the other, while every now and again, as a piece might slip through&#xD;
his fingers, he would make a spasmodic exertion to regain it, as if.he were over a precipice, and&#xD;
that the piece might fall down into tbe abyss.&#xD;
"4Can angels, In their heavenly flight.&#xD;
Look down on earzhwih pn e dtt&#xD;
At 1se'nestlkethese ?&#xD;
- .o' but the inborn.ende of hell&#xD;
Look on, and shout that 'All is wel e.&#xD;
'Tis t e waneto oplease."'1&#xD;
While matters stood thus with old, Gould and the Colonel, Fanny Gould was pining away in soli-&#xD;
tude. Her'-s was ia sad fate. From the day she' -was deserted by Dresser she could not hold up.&#xD;
hethead. Tobtsure, such-was his conduct that most persons would, under such circumstances,&#xD;
be rather glad than otherwise to be,rld of him; but then they had been man and wife, and it be-&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.&#xD;
comes in the breast of a woman impossible 'to forget, without a sigh, the man she had given her-&#xD;
self to for better or for worse. Thus were her days spent in uncertainty, and it bore heavily on&#xD;
her Search was made in all likely places where there might have been a possibility of a discov-&#xD;
ery, but still no traces of the unfortunate man.&#xD;
Tnis circumstance naturally preyed also upon her father, and it was very evident that Mr.&#xD;
Goul's whole family prospects were fast wasting away. On the other hand, Clarence Bolton&#xD;
and the Lees became every day more and more successful, The younger Lee made several ship-&#xD;
ments which were altogether fortunate, and there was now no doubt of the young firm becoming&#xD;
finally successful. There was another whose prospects were. dinmed. Old Wolff was reduced to&#xD;
poverty, and momentarily appealed to Clarence for assistance. While young Miss Gould saw&#xD;
with sorrow her unfortunate sister wasting away day by day, and did all in her power to raise&#xD;
her from that lethafgy, which her sorrow had brought upon her.&#xD;
It was at the close of a summer eve, when the two sisters were brooding over their situation,&#xD;
it was, reported that a cloak and hat were found on a retired part of a canal, some fifty mileS&#xD;
from the city. This struck Fanny at once, who, after many misgivings, made a determination&#xD;
to spare no expense in enquiring into the matter. What if it could be the habiliaments belong-&#xD;
ing to her lost husband; and as it was necessary for her to prove it by occular demonstration,&#xD;
she left the city.&#xD;
Considerable difficulty was experienced in tracing the clothes to the possession of those who&#xD;
found them. An advertisement was at once put into the paper, which was answered, and 'a pro-&#xD;
mised interview given.,&#xD;
It was with a trembling and fainting heart that Fanny, and the protector she had taken with&#xD;
her approached the appointed place. If she could recognise them as Dresser's, what but the&#xD;
deepest anguish would pierce her soul; and, on the other hand, were they belonging to some one&#xD;
else, still she would be under the uncertainty which had for so long a time preyed upon'her&#xD;
soul&#xD;
The door of a small cottage now opened, and in a few moments more Mr. Dresser's cloak and&#xD;
bat were presented to the view.&#xD;
A shriek from the devoted female now rent the house, and Fanny Gould was no longer a wife.&#xD;
The necessary drags were now procured by the neighbors, and after considerable time dragging&#xD;
the canal, the body of the ill-fated Dresser was recovered. It was evident that he hadin a fit of&#xD;
delirium tremens terminated his existence, and gone into the presence of an offended Maker un-&#xD;
prepared.&#xD;
The body was not removed, but was in a private way interred in a neighboring church yard;&#xD;
while no monument marks the spot where the guilty man was laid.&#xD;
The consternation among all parties, on the return of Fanny dnd her pro tectoi, can'be better&#xD;
understood than expressed. A gloom spread over the whole party, and which was only alleviated&#xD;
by the uncertainty which was set at rest as to the end of the unfortunate man.&#xD;
We shall not dwell longer on the painful subject than merely to say, that Fanny found somE&#xD;
relief in the consolations of 1%ligion, the only true source to apply to in calamity; and resign-&#xD;
ed herself, as far as possible, to the decrees of Him who gives, and who has a right to take&#xD;
away.&#xD;
The love that survives the tomb is one of the noblest attributes of the soul. If it has its woes,&#xD;
it has like wise its delights; and when the overwhelming'-burst of grief is calmed into the gentle&#xD;
tear of recollection, then the sudden anguish and convulsive agony over the ruins of all that&#xD;
we most loved, are softened away into meditations on all that it was in the day its oflove-&#xD;
liness.&#xD;
Who would root such asorrow from the heart, though it may sometimes throw a passing cloud&#xD;
over the bright hour ofgaiety,,or spread a deeper sadness over the hour ofglocm ; yet who would&#xD;
exchange it ?or the song of pleasure.&#xD;
Thus did philosophy apply itself to Clarence and Mr. Gould's~dughter. They had tasted of the&#xD;
bitter cup, and it required all the energy of their souls to bear up against the tide of -affiction&#xD;
'which'at one time threatened to overwhelm them.,&#xD;
The younger of Mr. Gould's daughters, though lovely in her life,:had griefsito-contenddilth';&#xD;
but youth seemed to overcome all, attd she promised to be ase r of the first magnitude.&#xD;
While these circumstances were enacting in.New york, let ters were being c'nstantly receivedl&#xD;
from the younger Lee, who, having established his name, character, and business in Europe, dg-&#xD;

&#xD;
-termined to leave for America, at all events for a season, and his arrival was hourly expected.&#xD;
It was, perhaps, at this juncture a providential -circumstance, as it yould tend, in some mea-&#xD;
sure, to dispel the gloom which had held, empire over the families in New York. Preparations&#xD;
were accordingly made for the reception of the younger Lee, and the evident pleasure derived&#xD;
from  the anticipation of his presence, raised the hopes, as well as the spirits, of the whole&#xD;
party.&#xD;
To describe the meeting of the parties, would be almost a-useless task, There are few in the&#xD;
world unacquainted with -the-pleasure of meeting a friend long absent, and therefore can enter&#xD;
into the feelings of all the parties we speak of, as if it were their own case.&#xD;
Young Lee arrived, however; and although there had been so many sorrowful letters written&#xD;
when abroad, still he could not but feel delighted at meeting his friends, more especially as his&#xD;
circumstances, as well as his partner's, had so iuch improved.&#xD;
Nothing could exceed the delight of the elder Lee on meeting his son. Indeed, 'what father&#xD;
who reads this simple narrative, but must fully enter into Mr. Lee's feeling. The young man&#xD;
who now stood before him had left him wild, inconsiderate, and only poorly conditioned in point of&#xD;
circumstances; while he now stood before his parent an altered person, indeed. Tall, and hand-&#xD;
some in figure, a young man of undoubted reputation; and 'though last, not least, wealthy to an&#xD;
esitreme.&#xD;
The female portion of the family were equally delighted, of course; and it seemed perfectly&#xD;
providential that his arrival was so opportune, assisting in a great measure to dispel the gloom&#xD;
that late casualties had cast on this devoted family.&#xD;
T No time was now lost by the Colonel to hasten to Mr. Lee's and assist in Welcoming his son.&#xD;
He accordingly visited the family, but -so numerous were the guests, and so besieged was the&#xD;
younger Lee by all the family, that-Colonel Yanderhoost did not stay long, satisfying himself&#xD;
with an appointment for'Clarence and young Lee to meet him the next day at Delmonico's.&#xD;
The day arrived when Clarence and young Lee set off at the appointed time to the Colonel's, from&#xD;
whence the tria juncta in uno proceeded to Delmonipo's. Dinner over, the Colonel now entered&#xD;
into a detail of all that'had occurred during young Lee's absence, and in return was treated by a&#xD;
description of his affairs while in Europe. The Colonel could not but be delighted, and although&#xD;
considerably older, yet this new feature in the drama of life seemed to resuscitate the old gentle-&#xD;
man, who could not repress a tear when he beheld the two young men before him, for whom he&#xD;
had at one time so many misgivings. -&#xD;
It was. wholly impossible in the midst of these stirring events for the unfortunate Fanny to be&#xD;
unmoved; indeed, since the loss of her husband she became quite a recluse. In vain did her sister&#xD;
recommend her to go'abroad into society, and try to dispel those thoughts which were preying on&#xD;
her soul. .Nothingi however, could rouse her; she still sought retirement, and in fact defied all&#xD;
entreaties from her friends on the subject-while hersister, now blooming into womanhood, was&#xD;
looked upon by all with admiration. In height she was rather about the middle stature, elegantly&#xD;
proportioned, rather inclined to the "en bon point " than to the sylph, though not so much so as&#xD;
to take away from the grace in a fascinating female figure. Her hair was light; her eyes clear,&#xD;
and azure blue; while a sunny smile ever and anon played ove* a countenance in which each&#xD;
feature appeared to vie with the other in producing a conformation that could not be scrutinized&#xD;
without producing admiration. - Her manners were indeed equally fascinatig -the "tout ensem-&#xD;
ble" producing no ordinary sensation in the minds of her corspeers of both sexes.&#xD;
Miss Lee was a charmer of another description; she,like the younger Miss Gould, was also a&#xD;
little above the standard height of the Grecian Medicis ; her raven tresses fell in luxuriant curls&#xD;
over a neck that might have put to the blush the summit of the snow-capped Chimboraz'o; her eyes,&#xD;
so indicative of the Andalusian ladies, were jet black, and full; while the long fringed eyelashes&#xD;
gave her face that dreamy influence so common to females of a Southern clime.. Her manners&#xD;
were also of the gentlest and tenderest kind, and to hurt a harmless insect purposely would make&#xD;
an inroad on her feelings that could not be easily forgotten.&#xD;
Thus were these two charming girls growing in beauty and elegance amidst the providential,&#xD;
-yet severe trials which others about them had been visited with, while we can with safety apply&#xD;
the jbflowinglanguage of the poet to them both-&#xD;
"Oh, voman, lovely womau! nature formed thee -&#xD;
To'temper man.-we had been brutes but for you,"&#xD;

CHAPTIE R      XXI.&#xD;
ONTEXTS-Depalnre of clarenee to Turope-his voyage, shipwreck, no.-the Lee and Sould family-letter from&#xD;
Clarence concerning bulltghits.&#xD;
UR readers will'recollect the position of parties&#xD;
-     at the end of our last chapter, and while matters&#xD;
stood as related, letters arrived from Europe&#xD;
with information that a mercantile house in&#xD;
~   -   Cadiz, with whom the firm of Lee &amp;amp; Bolton had&#xD;
0-     done considerable business, had stopped payment;&#xD;
-, and the accounts being in a very complicated&#xD;
~condition on the part of the foreign house, it be.&#xD;
became, after due deliberation, a matter of no.&#xD;
cessity that one or other of the partners should&#xD;
go to Europe. The younger Lee, having so lately&#xD;
arrived from there, threw this onerous duty, with&#xD;
--        evident propriety, on Clarence; accordingly all&#xD;
-                  -        was got in readiness- for his departure, and a1&#xD;
-    -- though it was not without some secret misgivings&#xD;
and regret on the part of all that he went, there&#xD;
was one in the person of Miss Lee who could not&#xD;
-  -   ~    ~ - -look upon even the temporary absence of Clar-&#xD;
-__ence without feelings of the most aseute nature.&#xD;
The business, however, of the firm demanded it,&#xD;
and the ordeal should be passed.&#xD;
it was rather a dark and unfavorable day when Clarence (after bidding adieu to home, his&#xD;
lover, and his friends,) went on board a ship bound direct for the bay of Cadiz. The vessel&#xD;
dropped down with the tide, and was some time before she reached the lower anchorage in the&#xD;
bay, where the captain determined to wait for the next morning's ebb, to get olear of the land.&#xD;
To one who has never ]eft home, nor has ever been at sea, or unused in any way to the din -of a&#xD;
ship, its crew, - and the bustle of shipboard, it may be easily conceived what feelings came over&#xD;
the young merchant upon finding himself in so unique a situation. 'he necessity, however, of ex,&#xD;
ertion on his own part, in order to arrange a little preliminaries for his. own comfort during the&#xD;
voyage, took up his attention so much that the next morning the vessel was well clear of Sandy&#xD;
Hook before he had any suspicion he was at sea. To those who are unacquainted with -nautical&#xD;
terms, we shall try and explain his passage as well as circumstances will permit in order to griatify&#xD;
them with disasters, though not fatal, that was destined to befal our hero as well as the devoted ship.&#xD;
For the first day or two out the wind was tolerably favorable, blowing what the sailors:would&#xD;
call a topsail breeze. It was not destined, however, to last long; and on the ship reaching the&#xD;
edge of the Florida stream, the captain's voice could be heard "intop-gallpnt sails--reef topsails,&#xD;
ahoy ! "Aye, aye, sir," was the reply, and the whole rigging now became thickly spotted over&#xD;
with human beings, like a nest of frightened ants when their nests were tramped on by a bear.&#xD;
They had scarcely relieved the ship when the captain, whose eagle eye was now directed to wind.&#xD;
ward, was againheard through the rising gale-" Close reef topsails, ahoy !1" "hoist away the&#xD;
storm gib -" The laboring vessel was now close hauled and shaken in the breeze, while the eap.&#xD;
tain recommended Clarence to go below; indeed, it is the only refuge for those'unacquaintsd with&#xD;
the method-of walking the decks. The vessel now kept her course, laboring ofcourse considerably&#xD;
in the cross sea so usually met with in what sailors call the ." Stream."&#xD;
Clarence now found himself truly and for the first time an isolated being, and as far as theIp0.1-&#xD;
tion he was then in, might truly say that he possessed no friend, had no home, and wasCAplg~im&#xD;
on the angry and uncertain waters. Such is life, and it was with no unmneasuredatety that he&#xD;
watched from his berth every stir that was made on deck.&#xD;
Night coming on, and the weather relaxing nothing, the ship was made &amp;amp;ll snug, ad the cap-&#xD;
tam, who had for so many hours toiled hard above, now cheered up his only passenger by express.&#xD;

&#xD;
deck-heave the ship to !" No sooner were the words spoken and the "hard down" repeated,&#xD;
than the devoted craft flew up into the wind; the storm gib was now hauled to windward, while&#xD;
the ship, after being eased of the fore and mizen topsail, lay to under the close reefed main top-&#xD;
#ail, storm gib and mizen spanker. The helm was lashed, and a guy rope run fore and aft amid-&#xD;
ships as security for the-men who traversed the unstable decks.&#xD;
Nothing can compare in sublimity to the scene on board a ship when matters are as just detail-&#xD;
od, as the writer can say from experience.- The sea appears one boiling cauldron, the devoted&#xD;
bark a shell, now lifted to the dark and angry clouds which appear to gather overhead for destruc-&#xD;
tion, and again lost between, the subtle mountains that threaten in their fall to hurl everything&#xD;
before them. The masts creak, while occasionally an unpropitious sea from the want of steadiness&#xD;
in the wind would sweep the decks, carrying off at one time perhaps a boat, and for certain every-&#xD;
thing not lashed to something that could only give way with universal destruction. All hands&#xD;
are abaft the binnacle, except when some casuality required an alteration in their positions.&#xD;
Thus did the night wear away, and it was not until half an hour after sunrise that the ship&#xD;
could be put on her course again. Towards that day, however, the weather moderated, and the&#xD;
joyous sounds once more reached all ears-" Loose the fore topsail!" "shake out a reef in the&#xD;
main!" and so on, until the ship again bounded safely on her course.&#xD;
Clarence now made hig appearance on deck, the captain sympathizing with him on the troubles&#xD;
which all landsmen must suffer under the circumstances of a first voyage.&#xD;
Nothing occurred for the next two weeks to mar the prospects of the voyage. Clarence's appe-&#xD;
tite recovered its wonted vigor, and coarse salt beef and a hard biscuit eat with more relish than&#xD;
any of the delicacies which the great markets of New York afforded.&#xD;
It was on a beautiful evening, after being at sea for nearly a month, that the captain gave or-S&#xD;
ders to swing anchors to the bows. This was the signal for the ship being near soundings. The&#xD;
bustle now on deck became more than ordinary, and every countenance gleamed with delight at.&#xD;
the thoughts of soon falling ia with the land; but how little did those think who were then con-&#xD;
gratulating themselves on escaping so well the storms already detailed, of the nature of the easu-&#xD;
ality about to befal them!&#xD;
&#xD;
The hilp uow lay about seventy siiles west and by south of Cape Trafalgar, while everything&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
99&#xD;
&#xD;
appeared propitious for the future The captain, whose eye almost constantly scanned the hori-&#xD;
son, perceived a small black cloud rise in the west, and on examining the barometer, discovered&#xD;
conclusive proofs that a tempest was at hand. The flattering and lagging sails " spoke," as the&#xD;
sailors say, against the masts, while the small cloud gradually extended, and finally overshadowed&#xD;
the whole sky. Every precaution was taken to rid the ship of her canvas; but before it could be&#xD;
accomplished, a white squall came down on her, and in less time than we take in narrating it, the&#xD;
ship was thrown on her beam ends.&#xD;
We shall not go into any detail of the cutting airay of the masts and other means resorted to, to&#xD;
right the vessel; but shall content ourselves with the fact, that in ten minutes from the accident&#xD;
the whole crew were afloat upon the ocean in two small boats, having succeeded in getting some&#xD;
provisions and water, a compass and some other necessaries, and were not a quarter of a mlle&#xD;
from the ill fated ship before they beheld her give a lurch and go to the bottom.&#xD;
As we are not writing a sea story, we shall not say more than that the two boats steered their&#xD;
course for Cape St. Mary, reached it without any casuality, and Clarence found himself the guest&#xD;
in the Hacienda of Don Cvosar de Bazan.&#xD;
We shall leave Clarence for the present under the roof of the hospitable Spaniard, while we&#xD;
take a review of the families in New York Fanny, whose melancholy did not, abate, began to&#xD;
snffer in health; so much, that it became necessary to call in medical Vpssistance. Some of the&#xD;
ablest of the faculty were at once resorted to, and by their unanimous vice their patient was&#xD;
recommended to go into the country. Accordingly under their advice, and accompanied by her&#xD;
sister and a proper retinue of female attendants, she proceeded to Saratoga, where it was hoped&#xD;
she might, with the assistance of the salubrity of the air, find variety to chase away in some&#xD;
measure the corroding influence of the mind.&#xD;
Mr. Lee's family continued the even tenor of their way, with the exception of Miss Lee, whose&#xD;
heart and thoughts had to "roam the ocean o'er," and find a solace-in the charmer Hope which'&#xD;
linge-red still behind. Young Lee carried on the business of the firm with success, while he paid&#xD;
an occasional visit, when opportunity offered, to Miss Gould at Saratoga. The Colonel moved&#xD;
about as usual, and all parties only wished the time to pass over quickly when they hoped to have&#xD;
a letter from Clarence.&#xD;
The Hacienda of the Spanish don and its rural situation, contrasted curiously in Clarences&#xD;
mind wivh the busy streets of the emporium of the Western World; however, the inmates did all&#xD;
in their power to restore the faculties of the stranger, who, after a week's rest, was promised a&#xD;
conveyance to Cadiz.&#xD;
Clarence now, for the first time in his life, found himself under the influence of the fair sex of&#xD;
another nation. Don Cesar had two beautiful daughters, and who that has seen the chiselled&#xD;
countenances of tl e Spanish fair, but must award them the greatest honors for the very highest&#xD;
state of beauty. Siill he never could lose the image of Miss Lee, and he could not but think how&#xD;
surprised all parties would be in New York when they received from himself an account.of his&#xD;
perigrinations.&#xD;
After a week spent under the influence of this delightful family, Clarence set off for Cadiz,&#xD;
which he reached in safety, immediately conferrin.g with the house his firm had so long transacted&#xD;
business with, and having rested a few days, sat down, and in a letter advised his frienderin&#xD;
New York of his safety after so many perils.&#xD;
The business he had gone .on turned out more favorably than he could have expected. The&#xD;
Spanish firm had wound up their accounts, and had fully satisfied all demands.&#xD;
There was nothing left now for Clarence, but previously to his return, to see all that was to be&#xD;
seen in a country he had little dreamed he was ever destined to see, and therefore made up his&#xD;
mind to remain until his curiosity wAs completely gratified.&#xD;
One week more and Clarence was to leave the country of love and romance, and there being&#xD;
nothing left of curiosity for him to see but one, he determined on going to its exhiy1tion.. We shall&#xD;
not describe his feelings, but allow him to speak for himself in the last letter he penned to New&#xD;
York, ere he embarked. It was a scene so novel to any one who never before witnessed it, and&#xD;
one which it appears had haunted him ever since he arrived. He had viewed it with such con-&#xD;
sternation, that be,could not withstand the temptation of giving soine account in the last letter&#xD;
he should write to his partner :&#xD;
" My DEAn L EE-I am happy to inform you, that the lagt act in thewnigpoftetn-&#xD;
action which I came here for, has been gone through, and all to my perfect satisfaction. Nothing&#xD;

&#xD;
could exceed the honorable way in which it has been completed, and nothing now engages my&#xD;
attention but the prospect of being back in New York. The ship ir. which I shall embark will be&#xD;
ready to sail in about a week, so I am all prepared, and I have determined on sending this letter&#xD;
as the last, of course, from Cadiz; so that you and other friends may be on the look out for me in&#xD;
due course.,&#xD;
" The last novelty of this curious country I witnessed yesterday; and as I have no better&#xD;
employment on my hands at the present moment, I will contrive to give you some faint iiea&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
"fHow little do people in the United States, who have not traveled, think what curious cus-&#xD;
toms prevail elsewhere; and what gave delight to thousands here yesterday, would cause there&#xD;
Auch abhorrence, that I am sure it would not be tolerated. I allude to an entertainment called&#xD;
BULL FIGHTS.&#xD;
. "Imagine a large amphitheatre, sufficient to hold some twelve thousand spectators, all dressed&#xD;
in the most picturesque costume imaginable. The governor of the province, and his ladie,&#xD;
suite, in the most prominent box; next the clergy, and others of the elite of the Spanish n.&#xD;
lity. A large door communicates with the amphitheatre, inside which is a stable, where. ta n&#xD;
mild bulls from Tarifa have previously been stalled; while men with spears from the loft above&#xD;
goad them to desperation.&#xD;
" The persons who are to mix in the bloody fray are divided into two assortments. First-&#xD;
the Piccadores. - These are mounted on horses; the latter blindfolded. Each Piccador has a lancO&#xD;
of wood, with a spike, about the length of a nail, at the end of it. Ten of these take their'&#xD;
places, one behind the other, around the circle of the arena; the first close to the door from&#xD;
which'the bull enters, the rest in succession. The Mattadores, who are on foot, and each pro-&#xD;
vided with a silk shawl, take up their stand in hiding places, made up of the stoutest material&#xD;
in the framework that encloses the amphitheatre. A Spanish regiment soon enters the arena,&#xD;
fbrms in line opposite the governor, and present arms; after this distributing themselves in the&#xD;
boxes, already detailed.&#xD;
" Every preparation being now ready, the gate opens, whea in rushes the bull  A flaming&#xD;
red ribband is seen flying from his neck by an arrow, which has been inserted in his skin. The&#xD;
audience now rise, an'd give three tumultuous cheers; while the bull, in madness and astonish.&#xD;
tMt, BV eys the scene, and n another moment rushes on the nearest Piccador, who sends the&#xD;
spear into the back of his neck. The bull now thinks himself pursued from behind; turn round,&#xD;
hut finding no enemy, returns to the charge, in every attempt of which he is baffled, and in de-&#xD;
spair seeks other foes. The same scene goes through with all the Piccadores, -but, perhaps, for&#xD;
want of skill, with not the same success. The second Piccador meets a worse fate. The bull&#xD;
now gets his horns into the horse, and throws him and the rider almost into the air. The fall&#xD;
is awful, while the Mattadores run from their hiding places, cast their shawl$ into the bull's&#xD;
face, and rescue the rider. The conflict now goes on between the hongA and bull, in which the'&#xD;
latter proves victorious. The bull now goes in search of other foes, and being somewhat worn&#xD;
out the Mattadors, all come forward. 'fhe bull now chases them alternately over the ring, un-&#xD;
successful in eyery case, and finally from exhaustion stands, and paws the .ground in despair.&#xD;
Every device is now employed to raise the flagging energies of the unfortunate animal, but to&#xD;
little purpose. Fireworks, attached to arrows, are now flung at the bull indiscrinWritely, and&#xD;
you perceive him enveloped in flames; while the occasional shots that go off once more bring&#xD;
him again on the offensive Some now jump on his back ; others hold on by the tail, until&#xD;
the animal becomes completely broken down. To kill him now, a Mattador approaches with a&#xD;
long sword in one hand and a red shawl in the other; the latter he throws in his opponent's face.&#xD;
The bull, in his last desperate attempt, rushes onward, and the sword is buried to the hilt in&#xD;
his heart.&#xD;
"The scene for the moment is suspended, while a muleteer, with three gaily attired mules and&#xD;
-a drag chain, draw the carcass of the bull, and any other dead animal, from the arena, to prepare&#xD;
for a new victim.,&#xD;
" I have thus been minutte, my dear Lee, and to describe the horror of my feelings, I shall not at&#xD;
tempt here. You will not fail to make all our friends acquainted with the p'eriod of my embark&#xD;
ation, saying everything possible for me, which I know you can do in your own way. Hoping&#xD;
that Imay have a~ more favorable voyage than heretofore, I am, my dear Lee, your's sincerely,&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
CONTENTS-Gltanees. t urn and prosperity attends the flimo-death of ranny-Clarenee Bent to Congress-and the&#xD;
Snale.s he marriage of Clarence to Miss Leerand young Lee toeoeins Gould.&#xD;
XACTLY one month from the time Clarence&#xD;
wrote his last letter he landed in Now York, and&#xD;
the greetings of all parties may be more easily&#xD;
understood than described. The perils he had&#xD;
encountered were the theme of the first outbreak&#xD;
among all parties, and as to minor details there&#xD;
appeared to be no end. Miss Lee was not among&#xD;
the last to welcome one, whom every one well&#xD;
knew was dearer to her than herself; indeed, she&#xD;
did not attempt to disguise it any longer, and the&#xD;
short separation only tended to make her as well&#xD;
as Olarence, if possible, more attached.&#xD;
:   z           True love is warm awhile,&#xD;
Cannot groir cold;&#xD;
",.*oenee.er bights the smile,&#xD;
E'er it growo li&#xD;
The two partners now exchanged business con-&#xD;
gratulations, and found themselves wealthy be-&#xD;
yond their possible anticipaions; while young&#xD;
Lee had no hesitation in informing Clarence that&#xD;
'Fanny's sister had made such inroads on his&#xD;
heart, that he only viewed her in the light of a&#xD;
being destined to be more than a friend. Congratulating parties were. now interchanged among&#xD;
Clarence and his friends, and his tales of Spanish adventures listened to with the greatest pos-&#xD;
sible pleasure, while the old Colonel almost fancied himself young again; such was the joy that&#xD;
pervaded the breast of one who had watched over 'Clarence for sudh a length of time.&#xD;
There appeared to be only one thing to dim the entire face of their affairs: it was the health&#xD;
of that one whose vicissitudes had hardly known a parallel. Fanny's health had not improved;&#xD;
in fact; thn very rverae waa the ace Faery eeeuuu  that reached the family made hem £el&#xD;
that if some decided improvement did not take place soon, her case was hopeless; and it was evi-&#xD;
dent, from the reserve on the part of the faculty, that they considered the matter in a serious light&#xD;
Matters were thus when an express arrived from Miss Guold, stating that Fanny's health still&#xD;
seemed to retrograde ; indeed, the doctors began to think it time to warn the family of the im-&#xD;
pending danger of their patient. Nothing, it appeared, could rouse her from a determined lethar-&#xD;
gic state  It appeared like a thoughtless act on her part, tind the consequences had broken down&#xD;
her struggling spirit, and she appeared not the least anxious to overcome the sad and painful&#xD;
results. She seemed to think she was in the way-that destiny had turned her out of the course,&#xD;
her youthful days had pointed out, and the world had therefore no place or home for her; her&#xD;
father, too, so sordid in his nature, added still more to depress her, and she only longed to be&#xD;
away.&#xD;
Two months from the time we speak of, and the quiet spirit of that once bright girl, returned to&#xD;
him that g-.A it  Of all the casualities that had taken place connected with the families in ques-&#xD;
tion, this seemed to be the most felt. When the old die we are not astonished, we are aware that&#xD;
the span of life is nearly measured, and that soon -very soon-the aged must lie down and sleep;&#xD;
but when we see a young and beautiful woman, whose hopes and fortunes have been shipwrecked&#xD;
on the false action of recurring circumstanceb-whose inexperience, and the want of judgment on&#xD;
the part of those intended by Providence to steer them in the path to comfort and respectability,&#xD;
but who, from love of gold, never attempt to direct the young and aspiring energies of their off-&#xD;
spring-when all this in after years rests upon the mind for the first time, and lays that mind&#xD;
prostrate in the dust-then, indeed, the subject becomes ode of the most painful to a contempla.&#xD;
tive being.&#xD;
The remains of the beautiful and the good were borne to their last resting ,place amidstbo&#xD;
greatest sorrow that ever pervaded either the immediate friends or acquaintances of the faithful&#xD;
and the lovely one, whose career was as short as it was mournful. A small tablet has been pieced&#xD;
in a neighboring country churchyard with the following lines engraved thereon, 'the comnosshion&#xD;

Stranger, whoe'er thou art, tread softly here;&#xD;
Nor strive to hide that gently filing tear.&#xD;
What once haa beauty, worth, and gruce combined,&#xD;
Loess here,.in peaceful slumbers now entwined.&#xD;
Be silent-markI while passing o'er th sod,&#xD;
The form atone is herea-sr spirit is with God.&#xD;
Twelve months had elapsed from the date of Fanny's decease when Clarence was called to the&#xD;
councils of the nation, and appeared in his place in Congress; indeed, so prosperous had been&#xD;
their course in mercantile affairs, tl at both him and his partner were now above the possibility,&#xD;
or rather liability,. of a retrograde movement, whilst their influence increased, as a matter of&#xD;
course, another ways  The whole family now looked forward towards the meeting of Congress&#xD;
which was to witness the debut of Clarence, and who had latterly improved his mind so that every&#xD;
one considered that hewould one day become a great statesman; indeed he had, in society with&#xD;
old politicians exhibited a mind that, if directed with energy on any particular subject, would be&#xD;
sure to accomplish the end aimed at. There were several questions regarding the welfare of the&#xD;
country generally that were likely to be brought forward, and a better field or opportunity could&#xD;
not offer.&#xD;
Clarence now proceeded to Washington., The time came for his appearance in the House, and&#xD;
when the usual ceremonies were over and he hsd taken his seat, all eyes were upon the young&#xD;
numberr, Who was he ? What was his name? and many other similar questions reached his ears,&#xD;
while his manly figure and deportment rivetted all eyes upon him Some days elapsed, however,&#xD;
before he made any move or spdke at all, and many old hands thought he would be what is gener-&#xD;
ally termed a "silent member ;" but in this they were deceived. Clarence waited his time, and&#xD;
just as it was supposed the matter under consideration had been worn threadbare and the house&#xD;
began to flag, he rose. Every eye was now upon him, and the silence which pervaded the Assem-&#xD;
bly was only broken in on by the breathings of an anxious auditory. For two hours and a half&#xD;
did Clarence unravel the question bringing up new ideas, and chaining into complete silence and&#xD;
astonishment his attentive hearers; while every now and again a general burst of applause would&#xD;
follow some pointed observation, sont home with that tact and eloquence, that literally astonished&#xD;
the whole Assembly.&#xD;
It is almost needless to say that from that hour Clarence made numerous friends, and received&#xD;
the highest encomiums from persons whom he had never met before. When the papers arrived in&#xD;
New York with the report of his maiden speech, nothing could exceed the joy of Mr Lee's family,&#xD;
and the old Colonel, who now saw his most sanguine hopes brought to fri'tion, almost shed tears&#xD;
of joy.&#xD;
That his fame could pass over the mind of Miss Lee in a casual way was impossible- to' conceive,&#xD;
and she silently decreed that her love was unbounded for him. His business, however, being ardu-&#xD;
ous, and his anxiety to do justice to his constituents preventing him from leaving Washington, he&#xD;
proposed to Mr. Lee's family to come on to the seat of government, a request which they c, mplied&#xD;
with.&#xD;
The meeting of Clarence and the family, for whom he had provided a splendid house, was highly&#xD;
satisfactory to all parties, more especially for Clarence himself, who now found his leisure hours&#xD;
so well provided for in the presence of her, for whom he alone lived; and the whole household&#xD;
,WMere scarcely settled, when visitors (the elit6 of the capital) poured in upon the family. Thus&#xD;
did Clarence's talent command all that was interesting and useful in the society which thronged&#xD;
Washington at that interesting period, while Miss Lee's beauty and accomplish-ments were the&#xD;
universal theme of all parties.&#xD;
In New York young Lee was carrying on the business still successfully, and enjoying the soci-&#xD;
ety of M4iss Gould, who had now somewhat-recovered from the effects of her sister's death, as well&#xD;
as other troubles hitherto detailed. The old Colonel sought the Washington papers eagerly, an&#xD;
gloated over the brilliant descriptions, that from time to time were published of his protegd .'&#xD;
ary feelingshtosgetirhemastery over him-not recollecting bthe fate of one, whose allegory has&#xD;
been left for our samonition and guidance.th                   mbrhaaled          akn&#xD;
The session at Washington now began to wear out ; many of te memeshd.led         tae&#xD;
thei daturn for ere rihomes, and Clarence, fnding that his servics were noloniger required,&#xD;
fusion; for what household can pack up and get under way without it ? The necessary arrange'&#xD;
mients for the journey being made, it was not long when all parties again met in the great city.&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARENCE BOLTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
We have now laid before our readers the life and chequered positions of our hero, and have no*&#xD;
only to prepare them for a favorable denouement. We are happy while we doso to be able to&#xD;
Wind up the account of his youthful days with pleasurable associations. - Our readers must ita.&#xD;
rally be prepared for the result, from previous hints to that effect, therefore we need' not recapi-&#xD;
tulate. Matrimony may truly be said to be the touchstone for good or evil to every one in exist-&#xD;
ence, and too much care and discretion cannot be used in its decision, more especially when such&#xD;
fatal results so often appear in public, as beacons to warn the youths of both sexes'to avoid the&#xD;
shoals and quicksands which, from a too hasty and ill-judged assortment on that important occa-&#xD;
sion, cause so many people to have their hopes and their fortunes shipwrecked. In the cases we&#xD;
are about to relate, however, everything that could be done has been between all the parties,&#xD;
andfrow experience through time, each one has been able to see whether the other was congenial&#xD;
to their tastes, in disposition, acquirements, and all the et ceteras which make up the character of&#xD;
our fallen nature.&#xD;
We must now, in drawing to a close, confine ourselves entirely to family matters. The Lees&#xD;
Were onee more established in the city, while the attachment hitherto supposed to exist between&#xD;
Clarence and Mr. Lee's daughter became no longer a secret ; indeed, they seemed to be made for&#xD;
each other, proving most completely the folly of a mere youth possessing -knowledge sufficient tobe&#xD;
really a judge in the matter in question so well as in after years.&#xD;
On the other hand, it was equally apparent that Miss Gould had for a length of time looked&#xD;
most favorably upon young Lee, and that a lasting attachment had been formed in that quarter.&#xD;
On the whole, the parties were looked upon favorably by every one connected with them, form-&#xD;
ing a strange juxta position to the generality of worldly transactions of the kind, as we see but&#xD;
few marriages where the universal consent of all parties are unconditionally given, or where&#xD;
some jealous 'person, perhaps in the form of an over fastidious maiden aunt, interposes her prosy&#xD;
ideas and authority, to mar the happiness in which she was never destined personally to be in-&#xD;
terested.&#xD;
Everything in Mr. Lee's household underwent examination, and all articles of furniture,"or&#xD;
other matter, not exactly according to the newest manufacture, were replaced by others; While&#xD;
Clarence had purchased a splendid mansion in the upper part of the city, in anticipation of coM-&#xD;
ing events.&#xD;
As soon as the situation of all parties became positively known, a series of entertainments were&#xD;
given in honor of the young men who had so perseveringly, and with such honor, worked their&#xD;
way up to the head of their profession --these complimentary usages meeting returns at the house&#xD;
of Mr. Lee, who now looked forward to that propitious moment when his darling child wa to&#xD;
leave him for ever.&#xD;
There is no parent but what must feel deeply on such an occasion; but in this case Mr. Lee&#xD;
had the full knowledge that he could not part with his daughter under more auspicious cirou&#xD;
stances, while he was also grateful to think that Miss Gould, who had passed through such an&#xD;
ordeal, and had yet a living parent whose days had been darkened by a thirst for th&#xD;
all evil, and who had also shut himself out from the world for that which' rust and mroth&#xD;
corrupt.'*&#xD;
The period has now arrived when we have to say, that a double matrimonial alliance had been&#xD;
agreed upon, and it but remained to appoint the day, when the hopes of all parties were to be e&#xD;
alised, by the celebration of the most solemn obligation that can be entered into by parties onthis&#xD;
earth. Accordingly the parties met, and it was deeded that one week alone was requisit9 et om-&#xD;
plete the necessary arrangements.&#xD;
The sun rose in its bright refulgence on the morning of that interesting day. MissLee ap-.&#xD;
Oeared, looking, indeed, like a bride; while Miss Gould, though beauty of another descriptlon,.&#xD;
was only a rivVi4n affection to Clarence's chosen friend. They mutually congratulated e&#xD;
as they appeared in the gorgeous and magnificently furnished apartment, that was te witness&#xD;
that day a change in their destinies, which could not be contemplated without some considerable&#xD;
UC ence and young Lee, and all the friends and relatives of both parties, now made their ap-&#xD;
pearance. The Ret. Thomas Brown, long known in Mr. Lee's familyaa divn   ossigms&#xD;
godlike qualities, had been summoned to say those few words, which could not be eos dtb&#xD;

&#xD;
*ho parties without that seriousness accompanying the will of Him who said, that a "man shoMd.&#xD;
leae'his father and mother, and cleave unto his wife."&#xD;
All the parties being now assembled, and a contiguous apartment having been furnished with&#xD;
a dejeuner of the most research kindthe two loving couples took their stand, acc mpanied by&#xD;
the respective parties who custom invarisbly accords them on these occasions. Mr. Lee now came&#xD;
forward to give his daughter away, whil6 old Colonel Vanderhoost proffered his services to Miss&#xD;
Gould.&#xD;
ctwo.&#xD;
Mr. Brown now advanced, and opened the book, from which the responsibility of the whole bu-&#xD;
siness lay involved, and, witi an impressive voice, while he made a beautiful extemporaneous pre0&#xD;
face, went through the ceremony.&#xD;
It is needless to comment on the congratulations of the whole party, and the tears of happi-&#xD;
ness that flowed from at least some of those deeply interested in the transactions that had now&#xD;
taken place.&#xD;
The whole company now repaired to the sumptuous breakfast table, while everything was put&#xD;
in order for the two happy couple, who were to leave the city that day on a tour to the Falis of&#xD;
Niagara.&#xD;
At eleven o'clock precisely, two tra veling carriages drew up to the door of Mr. Lee, when&#xD;
Clarence ad his lovely bride took their seats in one, and young Lee and his beautiful wife in the&#xD;
other, when, after mutual congratulations, they drove from the door. As they were " lov ly in&#xD;
their lives," it i's t6 be hoped that "in death they were not divided"&#xD;
We have now oly &amp;amp;few words 'of observation to make. We have given, as we professed io do,&#xD;
a faithful picture of the yogng mercantile aspirant from his earliest life. We have shown- what&#xD;
happy results arise from early attention to business, and a combination of energy and persever-&#xD;
ance, and the honorable issue resulting as the end, from a series of honorable means. We have&#xD;
shown society in various phases ; and we leave the subject, hoping it may, from its moral, tend t*&#xD;
ifuence these whose aspirations at the present moment may correspond with those as det sed&#xD;
-of Clarence Bolton.&#xD;
