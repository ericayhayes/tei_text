STRANGE hands may turn thir page and strange eyes&#xD;
glance o'er your name, to forget it before the quivering leaf&#xD;
has settled in its pa1we. But warm hearts in the Souti&#xD;
will join with me in the justice of this small tribute to one&#xD;
who found Redstick a country village, and by his enterprise&#xD;
and liberality, aeisted by st few of a kindred nature, has-&#xD;
made it what it i- -n ornowaxa to the Pelican State an&#xD;

although on speaking terms, he was an- inveterate enemy of Mac's&#xD;
and our many discomforts would have been sufficient warning to any&#xD;
othcr than Mac.&#xD;
One evening, that gentleman and I were taking a stroll along the&#xD;
brow of the hill, upon which, tle city was situated, peeping at the&#xD;
pretty girls behind the blinds, *hen we m4t Old Push coming along&#xD;
full tilt for the wharf-boat.&#xD;
"Good morning. What's the newsI"l he grufly exclaimed.&#xD;
" Well, nothing much," answered Mae, "'eept maybe that curious&#xD;
circumstance thit happened to Kexie (Push's partner) a few min-&#xD;
utes ago."&#xD;
Now be it known that Old Pgsh was the possessor of two remarka-&#xD;
.Ite things for that section of the country  one was a bump of credu-&#xD;
lity and curiosity .combined, whose' outlines would almost east a&#xD;
shado ;'the 'other, was a two hundred qnd fifty dollar watch, the&#xD;
, pride, the boast and envy of Lemionskeezer.&#xD;
"ell, what was it?" he exclaimed,' impatiently.&#xD;
Well, you see," rejoined Mae, "as Kexie was standing on the side&#xD;
gaard, and leaning over to see something down below, his watch&#xD;
went'kershug,&#xD;
"JehosaphatI   My two hundred nd fifty dollar watch! Bless&#xD;
thy" hide and tallow! Did he jumb overboard to get it ? Say,&#xD;

"Well,let go and keep cool, and Ill tell you.  Ie didn't umpb&#xD;

tat fish, and Kexie bought him for a dollar."&#xD;

"No, he dragged the fish to the guard, and proceeded to empty&#xD;
him, and put his hand in to. clean him out."    .&#xD;
" And found my watch,!",shouted Old Push, in a perfect frenzy.&#xD;
" Ie felt something round-"&#xD;
" My watch ?"&#xD;
" And the fish gave a squirm and slid right into the river."&#xD;
" Did he hold on to the watch ?" shouted Old Push, his hair stick-&#xD;
ing out straight with excitement.&#xD;
"le held on to a big potato, that was all that"- . Bing, went Old&#xD;
Push's fist in Mac's face, and a pretty little fracas took place; but imme-&#xD;
diately they were parted by the large crowd of blacklegs and little&#xD;
boys, who gathered in a moment from all quarters. Mae had a con-&#xD;
densed map of the State of Louisiana, alongside of his proboscis,&#xD;
which he explained to his inquiring friends, by telling them he took&#xD;
cold and it settled in his eye.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
How like some gorgeous dream the clouds arise,&#xD;
Revealing all the glories of the skies~,&#xD;
Whilst 'neath the rose-couch of the 'Gbd of day&#xD;
And resting on tfh green sward beauteous Iry-&#xD;
The haven of their hopes, enraptured band;&#xD;
Before them was their promised land.&#xD;
"How far are we from Redstick?" for the fiftieth time, inquired&#xD;
Mae of our French stage-driver.'&#xD;
"Jis one turn around ovare morare monsieur, answered that indi-1&#xD;
vidual, as he touched up the off horse and wheeled around the fence&#xD;
corner of a plantation, revealing to our expectant gaze the glories&#xD;
of Redstick.&#xD;
Our course for the last ten or twelve miles, had been over a level&#xD;
country which, gradually rising, here abruptly terminated in a lofty&#xD;
bluff, overlooking a verdant prairie bottom, extending for miles until&#xD;
broken by the wooded spurs of a low range of what are called hills-&#xD;
in the South, but what are more appropriately 'termed banks or knolls&#xD;
in the West. The whole prairie from hill to hill was studded with&#xD;
plantations, whose broad green fields of cane and cotton, were here&#xD;
and there broken by little clumps of white cabins, whose close conti'-&#xD;
guity to the stately mansion of the planter proclaimed them to be&#xD;
the residence of the negroes..&#xD;
.Redstick, was situated near midway from hill'to hill,and was of that&#xD;
description of villages common to the South. It was composed of one&#xD;
ong street, lined on either side with the many-colored houses of the&#xD;
inhabitants; most of which were embowered amid groves of china&#xD;
trees, whose delightful perfume fairly scented the atmosphere.&#xD;
a fw moments we were ratt in   along the long street, and&#xD;
driving up to the porch of the only hotel of the place, we alighted,&#xD;

&#xD;
and the stage rattled down to the livery stable to exchange horses.&#xD;
Before we could arrange ou . baggage, we were saluted on all sides&#xD;
with questions from a large crowd of planters and denizens of the&#xD;
place; the burthen of whose cry was: "Whose elected ': "Who&#xD;
carried Pumpkin Hollow ?" etc.&#xD;
I knew nothing of there being an election at: any place where we&#xD;
had stopped, nor neither did Mac; but 'that gentleman, as usual,&#xD;
looked as if he kneW all about it, and a knowing looking old gent&#xD;
took him prisoner and was confidently, informed that Crooks had car-&#xD;
ried Pumpkin Hollow by two huiidred' zm.jority. Now, Mac, was&#xD;
totally ignorant of the number of voters in Pumpkin Hollow, but&#xD;
picking up the name of Crooks from remarks. made by the crowd,.he&#xD;
had let fly at random, and hit his mark, for the "knowing one" imme-&#xD;
diately closed a bet of a hundred dollars, with a half drunk' individual,&#xD;
who seemed extremely desirous of getting rid of his money. 1%&#xD;
didn't care a cuss how he bet, he said, and anyway "to.please the chil.&#xD;
dren,". Some one else asked Mad about the result, and havitig received&#xD;
the same reply, the yelling, cheering and hooting were. tremendous.&#xD;
The gent who before didn't care a cuss, was now extremely desirous.for&#xD;
a fight, and meeting with another gentleman' in the same; beautiful&#xD;
humor, -at it they Went. In the meantime, Mae had become ex-&#xD;
tremdly popular, and the Crookites raised, him off  the ground and&#xD;
carried him around the hotel, until the "knowing one" proposed, A&#xD;
treat all-round upon 'the strength of the hundred he' had won from&#xD;
the poor devil then lying fiat upon his back out in the street. You'd&#xD;
better be of the opinion that' Redstick is no 'place -to propose treat&#xD;
with the expectation of no one taking you up; and no sooner oaid&#xD;
than done, the bar-room was filled to overflowing, and the triumph of&#xD;
the Crookites waxed greater and greater from the fuel it fed upon.&#xD;
Mac was called 'upon to give a speech, but not knowing with which&#xD;
of the two great parties the Crookites assimilated, he sang-the Star&#xD;
Spangled Banner, or rather attempted 'to sing it, for a glass of old&#xD;
rye going down, and "Star Spangled" coming up, his throat at the&#xD;
same time, got. tangled together and, liked to have, choked.him. HO&#xD;
was interrupted, however, in his vainh efforts to disentangle Banner&#xD;
from Spangled by a loud cheer away down the street. In a moment&#xD;
the bar-room vomited forth its contents and, the Crookites stood in&#xD;
breathless astonishment, gazing at their opponents who came up street&#xD;
shouting and yelling most vociferously. It appeared that the "stage&#xD;
driver," who alone knew how things had gone at the doubtful pre-&#xD;
oinct, had just given the lie to Mr. Mac's coek-and-bull, story, by' in-&#xD;
forming some of Mr. Shank's (Mr. Crooks' opponent) friends of the&#xD;
election'of that gentleman; by a large majority. ! In a few moments&#xD;
the. two crowds intermingled,- and the cheers, yells and hisses&#xD;
were deafening; the "knowing gent'"singled Mac out and sought&#xD;
an explanation, and that gentleman having tangled up his excuses&#xD;
the "knowing one," Alexander lik,undertook to solve the Gordiaip&#xD;
Knot, with a blow in a; great deal less time' than ittakes to-sepaitate&#xD;

Tim s is nothing more true thun the above "elegant extrack."&#xD;
Mac's #in was soon forgiven and apart from his tricks he became a&#xD;
generd favorite. We were, not in want of friends but clients were&#xD;
soarce, and it was soon demonstrated to our unbelieving ears and eyes&#xD;
beyond the possibility of a doubt, that howevet ready. people- are to&#xD;

Interests to the care of comparative strangers,&#xD;
Our only resource was to bide our tine, and pationtly wait until&#xD;

hoped to manage to get ,alongintil uh time when cases and clients&#xD;
would come upon us in flocks. Boarding is toleAbly' cheap in Red-&#xD;
stick, but unfortunately for us at that time, pork was *the cheapest,&#xD;
and in fact nearly the only article in the market. Our landlord had&#xD;
been led into.ant unfortunate speculation, and ovei' an -hundred head&#xD;
4f porkers penned up in the back yard represented a heap more cash&#xD;
than ever he got for them. Hog meat was down, and our landlord,&#xD;
to get rid of them, fed them to us morning, noon and night; broiled&#xD;
fried, stowed, roasted and every culinary mode ever invented, was&#xD;
put in requisition to enable' him to get rid of the squealers that made&#xD;
night hideous with their love-songs and war-squeals in the back yard.&#xD;
The boarders at length revoltdltat the pork-doings, and Mae being&#xD;
the chosen medium 'through whom we wished to communicate the&#xD;
extent of our wrongs, made * long and impressive address to the&#xD;
astonished, open-eyed landlord, U he At at the head of the table:&#xD;
"Since the days of Nero, never," said Mae, "has this tyranny&#xD;
been equaled."  ("Never, never," chorused the balance of us.)&#xD;
"My dear sir, (to the landlord), "you are a than, a humane mant,&#xD;

CLIENTS still forebore troubling our youthful nmindo with the earos&#xD;
of their cases', and Mac, getting discQtented, esc5lved to turA h*&#xD;
hand at something else. Disregarding all my entreatie, he entered&#xD;
into co-.partnership with the only livory-stable in the place.  Old&#xD;
Uncle Joe Field was doing a thriving business, and save in one respect&#xD;
had no earthly need 'of a partner; bus if there was anything he loyed&#xD;
better' than horse-trading, it was compsionship- and as his stable&#xD;
was not so often frequented by men of leisure as Mwjor  td's, hotel,&#xD;
Uncle Joe spent most of his time, to the neglect of hia business, 'up&#xD;
there,.aeated in a large shucked-bottota -chair, talking, laughing ad&#xD;
trading with every one who passed by. No*, as Uncle Joe had often&#xD;
missed great bargains by being sway from home, after mature dlib-&#xD;
oration, he came ,to the conclusion that he must take a partner, and&#xD;
as Mao very opportunely accosted him In the sabilet, they hitched&#xD;
horses and a trade was made on the apets Thetrangemerite Wert&#xD;
all made, an inventoryItaken, and after a few day* Mao fell. into the&#xD;
isual routine of stable business, and took upon ,himaelf the full man-&#xD;
agement of the concern, leaving' Uncle Joe at leisure to pursue his&#xD;
conversational bent.at his friend the Major's.&#xD;
t A few days before Uncle Joe entered -into. partnership with Mao,&#xD;
he had shipped off to a friend in the country for disposal, a very fine&#xD;
looking and apparently well-formned bay horse, one of the few me-&#xD;
mento4 of his once having been taken in and done for. With the&#xD;
korse he sent a short message to this effect: "Git rid of the uWis'rable&#xD;
cuss as poon as you oia and don't never let me set eyes on him agin.'t&#xD;
So worthless did Uncle Joe consider this horse, that he did not "put&#xD;
him down" in the inventory; in fact he was such a bugbear to Undle&#xD;
Joe that he tried never-to think of bim, as it vividly reminded hinm of&#xD;
the fact that his pocket-book was minus in the asom of two hundred&#xD;
dollars sinee hiastrade for that.horse.&#xD;
For rascality and all the ills horseflesh is heir to, Old Baywas sun&#xD;
equaled, and to mske matters ,warse, nearly, eerrybody khet his&#xD;
failings; however, as he was a showy horse,'with a little patching up,&#xD;
Uncle Joe hoped to palm him off onto someI eoatry greenhorn;gpad&#xD;
an old companion in horse-trading was selected to dispose of the&#xD;
beauty, as Uncle Joe facetiously called him. ~.  -       . -&#xD;
A' few daya pasted very pleasantly .aAd  aele Joe, was so well&#xD;

hesitate to -agree that Maw.should swap .ofrOld 'Roan. (a very service-&#xD;

One day, as: was his wont,, Uncle Joe sauntered ep to his friea&#xD;

bringing his broad palm down on that individual's shoulder with a force&#xD;
that brought tears into the eyes of his friend; "I tell you old fell, that&#xD;
suck in of mine when I-bduht ihat internal ?eauty, is the sorest thing&#xD;
I ever 'sperienped.". These words were hardly uttered,when Uncle&#xD;
Joe happened to turn his head up the street, espied' Old Bay coming&#xD;
down, with 'a long-legged specimen of the genus hImo, commonly&#xD;
eilledtGreenhorn, on his back. Uncle Joe's fade brightened up as in&#xD;
an excited whisper he called to the Major:&#xD;
"See yander! great Omsar !-but don't say a word," at the same&#xD;
time, in his excitement, he caught his friend by the napezof the-neck,&#xD;
and forced his head out likki altartlo's from the shell.&#xD;
"Did yotever! youre 'rid on him now," quoth the Major, as Old&#xD;
Bay with his drivei' drew up in front ofthe porch.,'&#xD;
"Stranger," said Uncle' Joe, (in a voice in which a desire to shout,&#xD;
laugh and yell, struggled for the mastery), "fine hoss you're'on! "&#xD;
"Why, ya'as," drawled- Greeny,1 "-tarnation fine to 'look at, but&#xD;
ormity coarse to ride".-..aint worth shucks."&#xD;
"Whar did.you git him?  What did you give?" asked Uncle Joe.&#xD;
"Wall; I got him out her# in the country a piece,'-and I gin &amp;amp; cool&#xD;
hundred for him,1 replied Greeny.   C&#xD;
"Let me gin you a piece of advice," said Uncle Joe; "when a&#xD;
man takes me 'in, I allers 'takes somebody else in. I know that hoss;&#xD;
everybodyknows ,him; andiif youi want to take my advice jes you&#xD;
get some where whar he .neverivar seed, and then let that, ar crittet&#xD;
slidW, and then git out on the way for fear -he mout hurt some body&#xD;
before ho stops sliding."&#xD;
The green one drew up his-reins, and after ejecting about a quart&#xD;
of bilious-looking tobacco-juice, hegave a sickly smile, and sloped.&#xD;
"I like to see a fool," quoth Uncle Joe; "but Il be skinned if it&#xD;
don't make me sick to look at such a cussed' geese as that-.-pitch in&#xD;
Lemons aid git ar skeezed.' Whoop! Cohe :Major, come -in, let's&#xD;
take a drink-hurra for pork and beans!"  .,&#xD;
With these exclamations on his lips we will leave Uncle Joe and the&#xD;
Major in the hand# of the barkeeper, whilst we follow Greeny, who,&#xD;
as he slowly rode along, chewed the cud of 'bitter fancy along with&#xD;
six ounces of Old Virginny.&#xD;
" Hello, stranger,,whar are.you bound?" shouted some one from&#xD;
the door of the liverytstable.&#xD;
-  Wall,.no whar in. pertick'lar."&#xD;
"How d'ye come on?"&#xD;
"Well, tolerable."&#xD;
"Won't you lite and look at your saddle-fine hoss your on; what&#xD;
d'ye ask for him?"&#xD;
"Finest hoss I ever heed,! out travel1all creation, and I dunno how&#xD;
I could spare'him; but ef I could git my price for him I moat sell&#xD;
him,'? replied Greeny. Saying ithich, he dismounted, hitched Bay&#xD;
to the rack, and at it they went.&#xD;
Bay's teeth were examined, anl as they. were of 'the hollow variety,&#xD;
144y stood the examidation very -well; Ithe trpenine used in the&#xD;

first trade still made a tingling sensation in his tender hoofs, causing&#xD;
him to prance like a colt; -Arabian Liniment had glossed .off the&#xD;
splints on his legs; and a beautiful wheeze was excused on account&#xD;
of the compression necessary in looking at his teeth.&#xD;
"What'll you take?"&#xD;
"What'll you give?" were passed' several times, until at length&#xD;
Mac made him an offer.&#xD;
" I'll tell youwhat stranger, there's a roan, as good a horse as ever&#xD;
wore hide or hair; I'll give you himland fifty dollars to boot."&#xD;
"Whew! good morning," exclaimed the stranger.&#xD;
Hello, dor't jump the -game ; tell me what you'll take."&#xD;
"Well, lookee here, to cut the matter short, jes gin me $150 to&#xD;
boot, en ef you aint to gwine to do it jes say so, and let I slide."&#xD;
After haggling 'an hour-or so the thing was done. Bay took his&#xD;
old stall in the stable, and Roan left with as rejoicing a rider as ever&#xD;
bestrode a horse. Mac chuckled to himself, " Joe even couldn't do it&#xD;
better; he told me to work off Old Roan onto somebody, and I'll be&#xD;
hanged ef somebody aint skeezed. Aint lie a beauty I just look at&#xD;
them  eyes; three years old, 'legs like a racer, head like a deer;&#xD;
jementally, won't Joe out a figure three when he comes around!" were&#xD;
Mac's admiring remarks.&#xD;
All this time Uncle Joe'was busy trading with the Major, and had&#xD;
succeeded in hogging him by saddling Old Roan on to him at an&#xD;
awful advance on first cost. He was i a grand good humor with&#xD;
himself in particular, and all mankind in general.&#xD;
"But who is that riding Old Roan?" he involuntarily asked as&#xD;
Greeny turned the corner, Uncle Joe's self-sufficient smile turning to&#xD;
a black frown as he came up to the porch.&#xD;
"Whar did you git that thar hoss, stranger?" Uncle Joe im-&#xD;
patiently asked.&#xD;
"Oh, jes tuk your advice and let Ole Bay slide. Hold that man,&#xD;
stranger," exclaimed Greeny, as he put spurs to Old Roan in order&#xD;
to avoid something more than mere jeatures, as Uncle Joe's liar,&#xD;
eyebrows and fists riz at one and the same time; "t Good-bye, ole un,&#xD;
don't fegit to mention me in your devotions;and remember, never&#xD;
spar advice to a greenhorn," lie shouted, as he clattered up the street.&#xD;
I was just passing-the hotel on my way to the stable as Uncle Joe&#xD;
put out for the same place. Could see he was awful savage, but as&#xD;
yet I knew nothing of the! cause; e passpd me like a whirlwind, and&#xD;
went a toddling down the street, stamping his feet at every step, and&#xD;
wickedly kicked over a little nigger, for smiling alotid'at the wonderful&#xD;
agility Uncle Joe displayed.&#xD;
I followed on, and when close to the stable, took a seat on a high&#xD;
stool in front of a little grocery, and watched operations. Jim was&#xD;
regarding his acquisition with looks of admiration, whether at the&#xD;
horse's beauty or his own cuteness, it was hard to tell. Joe arrived,&#xD;
his face puckered up in the most sublime attempt to control his&#xD;
'phelinks " I ever -beheld.&#xD;

"Fire agin, if that don't beat blazes, I never swear; but by the&#xD;

"Look at them legs," chimed in Mac.&#xD;
"Legs be swiveled, I fixed them up myself," roared Uncle Joe.&#xD;
"What a head and neck."&#xD;
Thunder onyour neek and bead; his eyes got more hooks in 'em&#xD;
than would catch oll the fish in the Mamasip,&#xD;
"Well, Uncle Joe,"&#xD;
"Don't tAlk to me about him, what bot did the ouss gin you9 that's&#xD;

"Moses in th hebullrushes! Qh! Great Tulius Ossar! I'll bet after&#xD;
losing fifty dollars in. the trade, you've gone and went and gave five&#xD;
dollars to boot for that humbug."&#xD;
Now, Uncle Joe,it is time to stoplthis foolishness; you know well&#xD;
the Bay is worth 6200 more than Old Roan, and I only gave $150 to&#xD;
oMillion thunders! " yelled Uncle Joe, 4s in his excitement he feil&#xD;
headlong in the saw-dust, where he rolled, and pitched, and shook,&#xD;
and cursed, until Mac was afraid the rafters would fpll in, Toward&#xD;
the cool of the day he let down a little, and Mac was pushed out of&#xD;
that partnership in very little more time than it tskea me to tell it.&#xD;
Well, he took his old office again; and applied himself to his boks.&#xD;
very assiduously; but it seemed as if Old Joe's tongue had a blasting&#xD;
effect on our reputations.&#xD;
With the exception of a large number of aequaiutanees, we had&#xD;
gained nothing since our advent in Ite4s1k, and er highly-colored&#xD;
visions were beginning to fade away in the dim distance of the past.&#xD;
Mac was wishing to pitch into everything in the shape of speculation&#xD;
that flitted past his chimeratic brain; but by the means of desperate&#xD;
argument I withheld him from involving his few dollars in schemes&#xD;
far more desperate, and, as I then arristacracally thought, lower in&#xD;
the standard than the hiverystable oseapade,&#xD;

on his side, the little fop-was in a sweet pickle whilst supper lasted&#xD;
After tea, whilst all of us (but-Mac,,who had retired to his room for a&#xD;
fow moments), were sitting on the back gallery, an opetr carryall&#xD;
drove up, an dthe latest specimen of human absurdity'min-the shape of&#xD;
a gaunt, bewhiskered, mustached fop, di-essed in the latest extreme,&#xD;
alighted, and ordering the driver, to drive aroundto the-stable, seated&#xD;
himself in a vacant chair, alongside of, a young lady, who, was&#xD;
stopping at the hotel until sent for from the country,. and commenced&#xD;
paying her desperate attention As Mae was coming 'dowh the stairs&#xD;
to. join us, Whiskerando got up to order his, servant to be ready to&#xD;
start at four o'clock next morning, upon the pain of having both ears&#xD;
cut off-and Mac having -a little penchant for the young lady himself,&#xD;
took the next chair but one fromi her, and leaning over, unmindful of&#xD;
the rest of us, commenced a- decidedly interesting conversation With&#xD;
her all about moon-beams, etc. Whiske-ando, having finished his&#xD;
orders to his servant, returned, and with- the geatest coolness in the&#xD;
world, popped his carcass down in, the vacant:ehair between Mae and&#xD;
the young lady.hThe surprise of Mae prevented his saying anything&#xD;
until such time had elapsed as to prevent anything more being done.&#xD;
in the premises. The rest of the evening-was. spent by us all, with&#xD;
the exception of Whiskers, in a stateof mauvaise lhonte. As for Mac.&#xD;
he was foaming with suppressed rage, and when we 'had retired to our&#xD;
room, it.ewas as mu',h as I could do to prevent, him from. going&#xD;
to Whisker's room, and pulling him out of bd,! and'then-and Ithere&#xD;
inflict personal chastisement on him for his display of impudence.&#xD;
However, he suddenly cooled 'down, and I wentto sleep. Next&#xD;
morning early, I went down to the barrroom' and the. first thing' met&#xD;

18'                     REDSTICK; OR,&#xD;
possessed over the steeds of the others. Bob White, the blacksmith,&#xD;
was on an old mule, and when just opposite the hotel,'annoyvd by the&#xD;
doctor's attempt to head hin by running his nag across the face, of the,&#xD;
mule, he rammed a' pair of -spurs, almost as big as dinner plates, into&#xD;
the mule's side; and rushed him right'aganst-the doctor; in moment ,&#xD;
horse, mule, blacksmith and doctor, were all rolling in the dust&#xD;
together. The mule and doctor were the first up, and after feeling&#xD;
Bob's pulse, the doctor -m6unted the mule and away he went after the&#xD;
hrong. Such another excitement was never heard tell of in Redstick&#xD;
since the day Fritz run away with Old Blaze's' daughter. All the&#xD;
women in the place were out, and the children clnab on the top of&#xD;
the houses, to watch the progress of the pursuers,' which was marked&#xD;
by a cloud of dust. Smith, on his mule, was left far behind at' first,&#xD;
but bottom counted in that race, and' he was again ahead when they.&#xD;
came in sight of the runaway's carryall. At this juncture of the race'&#xD;
all hands were going down a long gradual decent, and the race was&#xD;
terrific; cow-hides, spurs, switches, yells and curses were liberally&#xD;
made use of in order to accelerate the speed of the horses. Smith&#xD;
was still ahead, but Uncle Joe, who was mounted on a little grey'&#xD;
Cicole pony, was pushing him close. Some of the riders were' on&#xD;
their horses necks, with their arms clasped around, holding on like a&#xD;
" duck' on a june-bug."  One enterprising gent went flyig over into&#xD;
a Cherokee hedge, and it took two hours-'to extricate him, on the"&#xD;
return of the party. A cow that was lying down in the road unfortu-&#xD;
nately attempted to rise just at the moment Tonnerre, the barber, and '&#xD;
an overseer, who were "nip and tuck," attempted to jump over her.&#xD;
It is needless to say they went on an exploring expedition, through&#xD;
the air.&#xD;
In the meantime, the object of all this pursuit stuck fast in a slough&#xD;
at the bottom of the hill, and was cursing his driver like fury for being&#xD;
the cause of the accident. The pursuers, thinking 'that he was going&#xD;
to jump out and run, came down on him with .a perfect rush; Smith&#xD;
seized him first, but was immediately floored, or rather mudded, that'&#xD;
being the prevailing foundation in tiat neighborhood. Old Uncle&#xD;
Joeidistrusting his physical powers, made a rush at him with his&#xD;
poniy,1 and the three went down together. The 'rest coming 'up,&#xD;
Whiskers was tied hand and foot,; and after a chase after the nigger&#xD;
who disappeared through the woods hike a deer, and a short resting&#xD;
-spell, the cavalcade set out on their return. Their arrival in town&#xD;
was announced by a 'series of cheers from all the chidllren and&#xD;
little niggers in town; such another appearance as they presented&#xD;
'would have'thrown IPalstaff and his army in the shade. First came .&#xD;
ithe doctor on the niule, his hair scattered and full of mud, his hat&#xD;
gone, his doat split down the back, and two large contusions marked&#xD;
where he had com    in contact--first, with the pummel of the&#xD;
male's saddle, when Bob White rntneovr him, and afterward with&#xD;
Whiskerando's fist, at' :the inonient' of victory. The rest of the&#xD;
.evaleadi was 'in as bad a plight ;' and the appearance of Whiskers,&#xD;
ted like ahog,' and laid behind the foot-board, cursing and roaring'&#xD;

IN the thickly-settled portions of Louisiana, where larger game is&#xD;
scarce, rabbit hunting, in view of the many accompaniments of dogs&#xD;
negroes, horns, horses, etc., to the sport, is elevated, to a degree, as&#xD;
far as fun and excitement are concerned, on 'a level with fox hunting&#xD;
in Virginia, or deer stalking in the West.  Mac and I had'joined mia&#xD;
the hunt several times, and he was so wound up in the exciteent&#xD;
that he almost totally neglected his studies, and spent the" mat of&#xD;
time in the back'yard.of his office, watching the growth and sort&#xD;
three rabbit pups, for which he had been fool enough to ie twan.&#xD;
five dollars-a-piece.  To hear him talk,.you'd believe those mongrel,&#xD;

&#xD;
like a bull, drew tears of laughter from the assembled.crowd.' We all&#xD;
bent our steps to the old French magistrate's office and Whiskers&#xD;
soliciting my services, Mac was put forward to exhaust his legal&#xD;
-knowledge in the attempt to have him committed.&#xD;
The poster which was the cause of all this tumult, had by. this time&#xD;
disappeared, no one could tell how or where, and Whiskers having&#xD;
time to get several planters, who knew him, to testify to his character&#xD;
and it being proven that he had just arrived to take possession of a&#xD;
plantation some twenty miles beyond Redstick, he was'honorably dis,&#xD;
charged, much to the disappointment of nearly everybody, who wanted&#xD;
him committed to jail nolens volens. The suits which grew out of&#xD;
this escapade were almost numberless. Whiskers sued all who ia&#xD;
participated in the chase. Bob White sued the Doctor for damaIs&#xD;
to his mule and to his person. Uncle Joe sued four or five who. 'ad'&#xD;
taken his horses without his consent, and broke them down. The&#xD;
planter whose :co* had been killed, sued Tonnerre, and the overseer.&#xD;
and Tonnerre sued the planter for allowing his cow to be in the, road'"&#xD;
and to crown all, Mac and I were engaged in.every case, sometimes '&#xD;
was prosecutor's attorney, and he for, the defense, and then in the&#xD;
next case it would be reversed. Business cane all in a heap, and the&#xD;
speeches made at that session of court are the wonderment of the&#xD;
Redstickians to this day. it is needless for me to inform you, gentle&#xD;
reader, that the poster came out of Mac's trunk, of which it had&#xD;
formed part of the lining for many a year. By a few alterations,'&#xD;
cutting out the date and pasting the crevice with red paper, etc., he&#xD;
had gulled the Redatickers completely. His motive was revenge on&#xD;
Whiskers, for cutting him out, but as it turned out' profitably for us,&#xD;
he held his.tongue, and our villagers still think a great bank defaulter&#xD;
passed through Redstick about that time.&#xD;

ombenced poking the bushes to start out 'cotton-tails. But alas! for&#xD;
Maco, there was othei 'g'ine behind the bushes than that 'he was&#xD;
seeking. Going utp to a large cuiftpi he had no sooner thrust in his&#xD;
barrel, than up 'started 'the 'Colonel' BrAinur; with inane erect arid&#xD;
flanks contracted, he was a yerf'ect modell of fury, andl Mac would&#xD;
have soon been iimpaled upon his glistening stel-like horns, if th'e&#xD;
bushes hadl not intervened. Turnin  off'in a gallo ',the flrahma w'eit&#xD;
tearing around the long line of buses to get a ac, but you ett'h&#xD;
believe that worthy did not wait for him; the mainer in which he&#xD;
'used his legs wotld have been creditable to Lecorpte.; he steered for&#xD;
a low thorn tree situated about the middle of the field, which was the&#xD;
nearest shelter for him.; his he approached netrer to it, he perceived&#xD;
that it wa§'s urrounded by a low cordon of thoi-a bushes, but a glanch&#xD;
behind him, showed very conclusively hat it Was 'no time to swa$&#xD;
hordes, so pitching ito the bushes, 6 clumb the thorn 'tee without&#xD;
'the 'proffered assistanCe of the Brahma' horns, which were kind&#xD;
offered him, and a glance at the pi-'spects before him was by no&#xD;
tneans satisfactory. There stopd the 'rahma pawing the ground, and&#xD;
muttering low bellowings, whidh were the more frightful from their&#xD;
being different from any bull bellowing he had ever heard.&#xD;
The frghtful accounts he 'had hear of Brahma bulls' ferocity in&#xD;
general, and this one's superiority in this respect, in no manner tended&#xD;
to calh his feats in regard to his ultimate safety. Too round tO&#xD;
halloo 'for assistance from us, until we were too fair off to near the&#xD;
repeated yellings which followed his cooler ana  alm after-thought,&#xD;
and there being no chance 'of any one passing, by whom he, could&#xD;
send for assistance, his' siege bid far to rival Sebastopol. All da h'e&#xD;
clung on to the thorn tree, every now and then shifting his position,&#xD;
andpulling out the innumerable thotnk which stuck in his hide. 'At&#xD;
length he got so mad that ha tesoived to load up and kill the "inferi-&#xD;
nal critter."  Slowly loading his Au'i, he let off his pent-up wrai'h in&#xD;
every imaginable style of cursing:&#xD;
"You inafernal Asiacticyou!  You chase a free-born Ameri6an&#xD;

I tust, however, as proof of my friend's prudence, say that he did&#xD;
not begin to come down and put his threats into execution; and ft.&#xD;

Bralima linking that he wished for company, sent him his remain.&#xD;
fpg twent-five dollar pup from the point of his horns, right into the&#xD;
middle of the thorn,- over his head, and there he stuck until Mae&#xD;
poked'him loose with the muzzle of his gun. Following up this coup-&#xD;
d Aiien, the Brahma made a series of desperate attempts to get at&#xD;
'Mae ut happily the cdeveaux de frise of thorns was too much for&#xD;
his sh  gy hide, and he withdrew to a short distance and remained&#xD;
S there steadfastly eycing Mac,.until the latter got so enraged, he with&#xD;
difficulty withheld himself from the temptation of blowing his red&#xD;
eyes out. It was now near sunset and we set out for home, and as we&#xD;
passed Mac's 6ld field, we were too busily engaged in singing " We'll&#xD;
be there in a few days," to hear his desperate shouts. Enraged&#xD;
beyond measure at our'indifference to his peril, he took advantage of&#xD;
Brahma's getting. fastened in the briars, pAnd dropping out of the,&#xD;
:thorn, he put for the fence like a hot-pressed deer. The Brahma dis-&#xD;
fengaged himself inotime to arrive at the fence and give him a flying&#xD;
lift, that sent him flying twenty feet over the fence into the soft mud&#xD;
on the other side. Picking himself up he took a cool bath in the first&#xD;
,ond he came to, and came to the house almost froze, but as calm and&#xD;
unconcerned as if nothing had taken place.  To all our repeated&#xD;
question8 as to where his game dog and gun were, he made some eva-&#xD;
sive answer, and soon retired to bed, leaving us to make a night of it.&#xD;
Any one who has been at a ,planter's house where there was company'&#xD;
assembled, can imagine the time we had: dancing, singing, courting&#xD;
and cutting up in general was the order of the night; and about&#xD;
twelve we formed in procession and with the fiddlers in front, paid&#xD;
Mac a visit in his room; he received us cooly-that is, sent two boot-&#xD;
acks and a pitcher at our heads, and then we retired to rest.&#xD;
The, next morning, we were up early, and as the hunt was to be in&#xD;
a chain otffields some eight miles off, the discovery that our horses'&#xD;
had all been turned out during the night, aggravated and delayed us&#xD;
a good deal, and as they could not be found, we were forced to put&#xD;
wupwith a one-mule wagon which by tight squeezing held nearly all of&#xD;
us, the others, four in number, walked and took turn about in riding&#xD;
with us, they getting in when tired and four others getting out., Mac&#xD;
rode and drove the mule, and in this manner we proceeded, singing&#xD;
and shouting, as gay a set as ever set out on a rabbit hunt.&#xD;
When we came to the fieldin which the Brahma was pastured, and&#xD;
thrQugh which we had to pass in order to get Mac's dog and gun, the&#xD;
supplementary four crowded into the wagon and Mac, after an un-&#xD;
considerable delay. in letting down the bars, and repairing some part&#xD;
of the harness which had given way, mounted on the mule and in we&#xD;
put. The bars were securely put up, and in'a few moments we were&#xD;
,within a short distance of Mac's Sebastopolic besiegement, when the&#xD;
'rahma made his appearance, head and tail uJ his sharp horns&#xD;
glistened in the morning sun; he was indeed, a terrible-looking object,&#xD;
and the way we crowded ,together in the wagon, demonstrated that&#xD;
we did not consider ourselves altogether safe in our present position.&#xD;
&#xD;
SCENES IN THE SOUTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
:23&#xD;
&#xD;
Whilst our attention was directed to the furious approach of the&#xD;
Brahma and to squeezing ourselves closer together in the wagon,&#xD;
Mac suddenly let loose the back and breastchains, and the first thing&#xD;
we knew the shafts came down k'eersluinp on the ground,,and in&#xD;
another itioment Mac was tearing for the gate of .the field on the&#xD;
mule. The Brahma paid.no attention to us but kept on after Mac and&#xD;
pushed him closer than he any way desired. In -the meantime, we&#xD;
had left the wagon and scattered in every direction, but-the sudden&#xD;
return of the bull made those who could take instantaneous refuge in&#xD;
and under the cart. Ten or twelve could not get back, and they&#xD;
were forced to take refuge in Mac's late fortress, the thorn and its&#xD;
surrounding cordon of bushes. Onions, after. hesitating which place&#xD;
to run decided to take the cart, but his decision came nearly too&#xD;
late, the Brahma caught him when about four feet from the cart and&#xD;
pitched him headforemost among us, retaining however the seat of his&#xD;
breeches as a flag wherewith to denote his victory. We were about&#xD;
-twenty yards from the gents in the thorn tree, and the bull soon&#xD;
left us to pay his attentions to them. Although in a poor situation our-&#xD;
selves we laughed until the tears rolled down our cheeks at the fright-&#xD;
ful struggles of the thorn-tree gentry, in their desperate efforts to get&#xD;
one above another. As one would grasp a bunch of thorns, a loud&#xD;
yell of pain vould burst from him, and then as another would settle&#xD;
himself in a crotch studded with them, big, little, sharp and sharper,&#xD;
(there were none of them blunt), a tremendous volley of acres and&#xD;
oaths, would furnish fresh food for our laughter.&#xD;
As the Brahma trotted round on to the other side of the besieged,&#xD;
we in the cart made e desperate sally, but it was short, sweet and de6&#xD;
cisive; the bull ccnmilig at us "with a perfect rush," we scrambled&#xD;
in and under the cart, and blessed our stars we all' got under cover.&#xD;
Trotting around us several times, he returned to his first love, the&#xD;
thorn-tree gentry, and we were concocting schemes to get out of our&#xD;
dilemma; but lo! a new enemy made his appearance. Our friends un-&#xD;
der' the cart shouted out, "Hornets! hornets!" and clambering up the&#xD;
sides, the black stream of little demons which 'followed them,;showed&#xD;
us that there was something as bad as Brahma bulls in this world of&#xD;
ours. At the first -onset, we deserted the cart unanimously, but the&#xD;
Biahma came down on us "like a thousand of brick," and we scram-&#xD;
bled back into the cart, an all hands 'getting in behind'to avoid the&#xD;
bull's horns, it tilted up  and of all the promiscuous intermingled&#xD;
'scrambling that beat   Into the cart again, we commenced with&#xD;
our only weapons, our hats, defending ourselves, against our new op-&#xD;
ponents, the hornets, and -after a short, 'decisive battle, we were left&#xD;
with tnany painful bumps the victors.&#xD;
All this time M'ae was setting on the top of :an' old' stum  in the&#xD;
neighboring field, shouting to us to "'Ge it!" "give 'em  cssorsii&#xD;
'6 pitch in and get squeezed !" etc.; and the distance being too great&#xD;
for him' to discern clearly'-our maneuvers, he took up a nearer posi-&#xD;
tion on the fence, anl there shouted and laughed until we thought&#xD;
-he'd explode. His movement, however, saved us, for the bull, attracted&#xD;

and thg cart was by far ahead of tall the feats of agility ever dis-&#xD;
played in a circus. The race for the opposite side of the fence from&#xD;
where the Brahma was,'was hotly contested. Two or three fell down&#xD;
in a little -hollow of vater, and their cries to the balance of us to stop&#xD;
foi them were affecting but not effective. The main body reached the&#xD;
fence, and the "Balaklava charge" was no comparison to the manner&#xD;
in which that fence was charged; 'ten pannels at least, went down be-&#xD;
fore the fury of our onset, and they stayed down, for no one remained.&#xD;
behind to put them up. We never broke a trot until we arrived safe&#xD;
at the 'Colonel's.!&#xD;
Mac had arrived before us, but did not await our arrival. Order-&#xD;
ing his horse he had put for Redstick, and thereby saved his hide.&#xD;
We had a -8plendid time extracting thorns and curing our many&#xD;
stings and contusions, and the rabbit 'hunt broke up with more hunters&#xD;
hurt than rabbits,&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
"Truth will out." "&#xD;
Ws had been residing in Redstick over a twelvemonth, and although&#xD;
the practice of a Choate or Webster had not as yet showered upon&#xD;
our devoted heads its golden reward, still we had eases enough to pay&#xD;
expenses and allow a semi-occasional spree; which I am sorry to&#xD;
inform you, gentle reader, (for the credit of the Redstickians) was by&#xD;
far the most rapid manner for us to ingratiate ourselves among that&#xD;
community. One little drunk, as it is there expressively denominated,&#xD;
'went farther to gain us friends than all the eloquence we so energeti&#xD;
cally, and, I may say, sometimes frantically expended within the&#xD;
limits of the old brown court-house.&#xD;
Do not gather from the above, dear reader, that getting on a spree&#xD;
is the best manner of making acquaintances in every section of&#xD;
ebuntry; for in some places the Redstick code will not carry a man&#xD;
through with a brick in his hat; for instance, my friend Fred&#xD;
Hoops, Esq., whilst on a visit to New Orleans, finding himself lonely,&#xD;
tried the above method, and he deliberately takes his oath, that the&#xD;
only acquaintance the brick made for him, was an introduction to&#xD;
some brother bricks and a crazy Dutchman, who together formed the&#xD;
walls, and, save himself, the 9uly inmate of the calaboose, into which&#xD;
delectable depository he found -himself before night. '&#xD;
But to ay y'lang, as they say in: Arkansas, Of cases we had a few,&#xD;
6f debts a*me,  and of friendesa 4ehop. We were invited to all the&#xD;
balls, went to see all the girls, and ,both, in company with all the mar-&#xD;
riageable young men ia theneighborhood, paid desperate, though&#xD;

?istfant attentions to one bright particular star who, to the attractions&#xD;
of beauty, wit and intelligence, added the almighty puissant -attractive&#xD;
quality of wealth. I'say, we paid her distant attentions, for ithe fact&#xD;
was, she gave none of us any proof that our flattering attentions were&#xD;
in any manner desirable.&#xD;
One evening I received a triangular scented billet, containing the&#xD;
satisfactory information that my company was desired at a ball, to be&#xD;
given the succeeding evening, at the residence of one of our wealthiest&#xD;
citizens; and pluming myself upon the distinguished honor-fki' the&#xD;
party was at one of those aristocratic southerners, who look not upon&#xD;
(as they style them) second-rate Hoosier lawyers, as in any way their&#xD;
equals in social position. I went over9o Mac's office, nd found him&#xD;
caperimg about from the effects of a sidifar invitation finding ius way&#xD;
to his sanctum.&#xD;
"What do you think of it, Hal?" he asked me,. as I entered the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
" Well, I don't know; are you going ?" .2&#xD;
4" Certingly man! don't you know they are cousinS of Miss Ducha-&#xD;
pitzwha, (Anglice-Mac's Tennessee French for Dudiapell4), and she'll&#xD;
sure to be thar; and another thing I'll tell you, Hal, in confidence; now,&#xD;
mind you-you know how shelooked at me in church last Sunday."&#xD;
"Go to grass with her looking at you last Sunday; you know it -was&#xD;
because Dick Foxy fastened the office towel to your coat-tail; who&#xD;
the dickens wouldn't look at you, and laugh too, for that matter ?"&#xD;
" Oh, you are a dratted fbol-dirn that towel! I'll be even with&#xD;
Dick yet for that.- But never rnid, she looked at me and smiled, and&#xD;
I'll be hanged if she hasn't had me booked for to-morrow night of her&#xD;
own accord."&#xD;
"Well, never mind that; are we going to the oyster-supper at&#xD;
ve's to-night ?"&#xD;
Why, ya-as ; but I don't like to much-I'll look confounded&#xD;
sleepy to-morrow night."&#xD;
That night we went to a rousing oyster-supper, and about twelve&#xD;
we had each and every one of us become slightly merry; whether&#xD;
from the effects of the oysters, or their accompaniments, I am unable&#xD;
to say.&#xD;
But, any how, the party had let down to about half-a-dozen real&#xD;
genuines,. including, of course, Dick Foxy, Mac and me ; and the-&#xD;
subject matter of conversation warped around to the ball of the next&#xD;
night, and we commenced joking Mac about Miss Duchapell6.&#xD;
"Well, joke away, my heroes; I'll bet any ono of*you twebty-five&#xD;
dollars I go home with herto-morrow night."&#xD;
"Done," exclaimed half-a-dozen, and Mae was taken up on all&#xD;
sides; but as he would only bet twenty-five, ard seemed very&#xD;
distrustful at that, I was allowed to take upythegentleman's bet.v&#xD;
What plans Mac and Dick concocted that night, will all come out&#xD;
before you get to the end of this chapter; suffice it to say, I assisted&#xD;
another gent hoine, and we followed close behind the two aforemen-&#xD;
tioned, and in their eagerness to arrange the plan of action, I&#xD;

oPerandi.&#xD;
The next night was the crisis of Mac's fate, and twenty-five bet,&#xD;
and we all went up to the scene of action "dressed to death," and&#xD;
in perfect fidgets. That ball! Oh, reader! I will not attempt to&#xD;
describe. Fancy the golden, radiant .gems above falling to earth,&#xD;
and assuming, as they fall, the glorious shape of that "last, best&#xD;
gift to man "-fancy all the concentrated ottar of beautiful fancies&#xD;
your mind is capable of, and then, oh reader, fancy that you'miss&#xD;
the beautiful reality several feet. Redstick was then in all her glory,&#xD;
and, for beauty, Redstick is, just as far ahead of all creation as&#xD;
you fancy your own bright particular star leads the galaxy of&#xD;
womankind.e&#xD;
Miss D. was there; but a splendid specimen of mankind, in the&#xD;
shape of her cousin just arrived from a European tour, kept back&#xD;
by his attentions to her, the vain efforts of several who had hoped&#xD;
that night to enjoy exclusively the conversation of Miss D. Mac&#xD;
looked, daggers at the fellow, whose glossy black mustache so far&#xD;
outshone his own stubby sorrel, as to prevent the lady in question&#xD;
from even- noticing it-that mustache that had cost him so much&#xD;
time, so much trouble, and never to be even looked at, much less&#xD;
noticed, by the lovely fair one-for whose beautiful eyes it was solely&#xD;
intended-but never mind, Mae, yours was not the first bush that&#xD;
shedd its beauty on. the desert air." I&#xD;
About three o'clock in the morning, the advance-guard commenced&#xD;
a retreat toward home, and, somehow or other, some twenty of us&#xD;
young men gatherra around the door, and. chatting, laughing and&#xD;
betting, passed merrily the time away. Inside of the door vas a large&#xD;
gang of negro and mulatto girls; some of them as white, if not&#xD;
fairer, than their mistresses. These were the maids in waiting, armed&#xD;
cap-a-pie with shawls, talhas, etc., ready to encase the fair forms of&#xD;
the young missis at the shortest notice. Amidst the confusion of the&#xD;
gay scene, I kept my eye steadily upon Mac, who, after a whispered,&#xD;
confab with one of his particular friends, nudged him laughingly&#xD;
under the 'ribs, and gaily disappeared among the throng of waiters&#xD;
inside the door. In a moment afterward, a darkey emerged from the&#xD;
crowd, and, approaching Miss D. and her chaperon, vho stood lovingly&#xD;
engaged in the, to us, delicious operation of encasing her lovely form&#xD;
in the various millinery fixing necessary to protect her from the&#xD;
chilly air on their way home, bowing low, the darkey handed the gent&#xD;
a card, upon reading which he seemed greatly surprised, and, abruptly&#xD;
leaving his partner, made his way through the crowd. He was away&#xD;
out doors some ten or fifteen minutes, and when he returned, he Was&#xD;
met by the fair belle, who, taking his hand, sprang into the carriage,&#xD;
called up by the stentorian lungs of the black porter who kept&#xD;
vociferating-"Mis Duchapelle/s carriage."&#xD;
Away they rolled out of the yard, around the corner, on the road&#xD;
toward the residence of Miss D. In a few moments the crowd of men&#xD;
fell back, and, to our surprise, the old darkey commenced vociferating&#xD;
&#xD;
SCENES IN THE SOUTU.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"Miss Duchapell' !' As her carriage was already gone, Mac stepped&#xD;
up, and, politely showing, informed the lady that some one had carried&#xD;
off her carriage, and offered his services to see her home. After a&#xD;
moment's hesitation, she mechanically took his arm, and drawing her&#xD;
thick vail closer over her fair face, off they went.&#xD;
Amid a storm of jokes and jeers about mys lost twenty-five, I&#xD;
repaired to the hall, and walking up to where her cousin had left her&#xD;
standing, I found Miss Duchapell' 'still awaiting his reappearance.&#xD;
As I. was slightly acquainted with the lady, I requested permission to&#xD;
see her home; which request, as she was evidently nettled at her&#xD;
cousin's strange conduct, after some hesitation, she. accorded. As&#xD;
she was all ready, we -started out, and the look of surprise which&#xD;
puckered up the faces of my companions at the door, as we caine out,&#xD;
affles description. Not noticing the low expressions of astonishment&#xD;
;which greeted our tars, we were soon out in the street on our way to&#xD;
the lady's residence.&#xD;
In high spirits at the way things had turned out, I made myself&#xD;
agreeable to Miss D. in the best style I could assume. It was'a long&#xD;
walk, and unbroken by anything unusual, until we were within a few&#xD;
hundred yards of her residence, when we suddenly came upon her&#xD;
cousin,.who was standing stock still, gazing into vacancy. Upon our&#xD;
approach, he mechanically made way; but recognizing Miss D., he&#xD;
sprang forward and exclaimed!&#xD;
"Why, Lucy! what is the meaning of all this ?"&#xD;
"I do not know to what you allude, Colonel; I have notning to&#xD;
explain ; and if you have, perhaps another time would suit just as&#xD;
well."&#xD;
Surprised and indignant, he bowed low and turned away.&#xD;
Passing on, as we neared the house a series of yells and oaths&#xD;
met our astounded earg. They seemed to proceed from the garden&#xD;
in front of the house, and in a few moments I could distinguish the&#xD;
voices of Mac and Dick, intermingled with the loud barking and yells&#xD;
of at least a dozen dogs. Hastening forward, we were about ten feet&#xD;
from the gate, when a terrific crashing among the -shrubbery took&#xD;
place, and Mac came flying over the fence with a dog fast to each coat&#xD;
tail. A moment after the gate flew open with a bang, and out came&#xD;
Dick, dressed in women's clothes, tho skirt of which was lined with&#xD;
dogs, each one affectionately doing his best to induce him not to leave&#xD;
the grounds, at least, not before partaking of their hospitality.&#xD;
Kicking like a fury, Dick got his legs entangled into the skirts and&#xD;
came down her whang, crushing one of the dogs in his fall. With the&#xD;
assistance of Miss D., whose voice had more effect than my-kicks, we&#xD;
liberated the gentlemen; and bidding Miss D. an afectionate good&#xD;
night, I helped him denude himself of his borrowed finery, which-&#xD;
threw desperately into the ditch alongside the road; and then, after&#xD;
using up the whole cursing vocAulary, he forthwith let the cat out of&#xD;
the bag.&#xD;
Mae had engaged a colored girl to personate the first Miss D.,&#xD;

TheseondMiss D. was no less than Mr. Dick Foxy, dressed to&#xD;
personate her. Dick told, an awful tale on Mac: He says that&#xD;
enterprising gent plied him with questions relative' to her property,&#xD;
that *ould have taken ten clerks of the court to answer, and that&#xD;
when they arrived at the house, Mac popped the questions ormally to&#xD;
her-him, I mean-and that the low tender answer the counterfeit lady&#xD;
made was interrupted by a charge of dogs that would have done&#xD;
honor to Balaklava.&#xD;
h" The worst," said Dick, ",was this catching me round the waist and&#xD;
holding me between him and the confounded hounds, hollering all the&#xD;
time, Keep 'em off, Miss D.f keep 'em off!'  I was so full of&#xD;
laugh," continued that individual, "that if it had not a bin that an old&#xD;
brindle bull-dog niyped my leg, I would have tried to keep up tho&#xD;
farce ; but I thought if it kep on, I might make food for dogs, and I&#xD;
hollered out, 'Let me go, Mac and help me get out of this!' Don't&#xD;

pounding me like dairnation-! He'd have beat ine to a je.l if old&#xD;

the whole resulted in Dick's challengingaMac to fight him that eyen"&#xD;
ing-which challenge Mae immediately acceptedA.&#xD;
" Mac," I exclaimedfin surprise, "'is it possible,; is this going to be&#xD;
the end of all the bright hopes and happy aspirations we, so hopefully&#xD;
pictured das stored in the future for us.?"&#xD;
"Well, I don't care, Hal, I am in for it now, and I'll be hanged; if&#xD;
I don't go through with it,"&#xD;
Thinks I to myself,. well, you are in. for it; but a happy thought&#xD;
struck me, and I requested him to allow me to, act as, his accond.&#xD;
"1oo late, 'old fell,' Jim Hartz acts for me. I am sorry I didn't&#xD;
think of you; but the fact is, the whole matter was. transacted in such&#xD;
a hurry, that all my presence of mind forsook me, and Ijust left the&#xD;
patter in the hands of Jim and Bob Smith, who both showed a devil&#xD;
of a desire to accelerate matters."&#xD;
Finding I could do nothing, as matters then stood, for Jim and Bob&#xD;
were of the chivalry class, and would almost as soon be horse-whipped&#xD;
as give up their chances of figuring in a bonarfide duel, I requested&#xD;
Mac to wait until I came back, and, taking my hat, off I put for Dick'g&#xD;
residence, which was some distance from my. office,. On my, arrival,&#xD;
Dick himself answered my knock, and coldly inviting Me. to enter,&#xD;
requested me to seat myself trnd let, hirth, know what I was after.&#xD;
" Well, Dick, I come to put an end to this. nonsense."&#xD;
"Nonsense be hanged," he exclaimed; "I'll tell you what, Hal, if&#xD;
Mac has sent you on this cowardly errand, you, can go baek and "-&#xD;
" Hold up,, my dear sir-Mao never sent me to beg off, and so far&#xD;
from begging of, if be don't put you through remember that you can&#xD;
have the pleasure of meeting one who. is more on an, equality, with&#xD;
you in the art of pistol shooting;" so saying I left the premiseA, and&#xD;
left with a determination to see, the matter fairly out,&#xD;
Mae and I were busy all that day in devising, plans to prevent there&#xD;
being any foul. play, for he had unfortunately; allowed a second, to be&#xD;
forced. upon him, who evidently bore him no' great good will, the&#xD;
gentleman not coming near him during the day.&#xD;
At four o'clock we took up a bee-line for the place where theaffair&#xD;
was to come of', and were extremely surprised t the vast; concourse&#xD;
assembled to see the sport. Our arrival was greeted with loud shouts&#xD;
of " Here they come,-hurra," "Goit, sabots!" and other situilar ex,'&#xD;
pressions. Men and boys, darkeys, and,'infact, the whole masculine&#xD;
population were upon the ground; some, engaged in quarreling, and&#xD;
others in betiny upon the result.&#xD;
After a great deal of jabbering and fussing, the principals took up&#xD;
their positions at twenty paces, their pistols were handed to them, and&#xD;
the crowd fell back into two lines. Atthis moment, and just as:Boh&#xD;
Smith was about to give.the word, a great deal of yellingand hooting,&#xD;
hurraiing and vociferating, from, the crowd, attra'eted, the attentionw&#xD;

who were coming tearing up theiroad on foot; theywere, soon:recogr&#xD;

so                  -   REDSTICK; OR&#xD;
they were all' possessed of to have the 'duel come off before the&#xD;
honorable gents arrived Qfl the ,ground.&#xD;
hoAt this moment the ground presented a curious scene ; about one-&#xD;
half the crowd were' pulling and hauling at Mac and Dick, interfering&#xD;
with the seconds, and by their own haste rendering it impossible for&#xD;
the two gents to perform what the crowd expected and wished of them,&#xD;
without endangering the lives and limbs of half-a-dozen individuals;&#xD;
the balance of the crowd were engaged either in betting on the race,&#xD;
between the justice and constable, or quarreling gInd fighting .about&#xD;
Dick and Mac.&#xD;
In a few moments the minions of the law arrived on the ground&#xD;
completely exhausted, old Judge Chickoy who'was a two hundred and&#xD;
fifty pounder, falling; completely out of breath upon the swardl; it&#xD;
afterward leaked out that they had been playing poker at the Spread&#xD;
Eagle, and under the impression that the affair wouhf not come off&#xD;
until six o'clock, they came pretty near missing the fun.&#xD;
All fears of their in any way interfering were soon put to flight&#xD;
by the old judge exclaiming, as he arose from the ground:&#xD;
"4Who--who'll be-bet me twenty-five agin Mac's pinning him the&#xD;
first pop ?"&#xD;
As everybody had bet all they wished on the result, the judge was&#xD;
forced to look on, as he expressed it, "as a disinterested spectator."&#xD;
The crowd were again forced back from.the space occupied by 'the&#xD;
combatants, and Mac and Dick once more faced each other, prepared&#xD;
to wash out in blood the fancied stains upon their honor. I may here&#xD;
remark that they had not been setting upon the grass.&#xD;
Bob Smith prepared to give the word, and one, two, came out of&#xD;
his mouth, as clear, sonorous and distinct as if he were calling upon&#xD;
all hands to walk up and take a drink. At this point, a little fice ran&#xD;
across the field between the principals, and the owner, awfully con-&#xD;
cerned for the safety of the little "varmint," yelled out: 2&#xD;
"1Stop the fight I great Gin'ral Jackson! don't shute my dog."&#xD;
Here, again, a general uproar took place, and such a cursing as&#xD;
that poor ficeand his unlucky owner got would have shattered the&#xD;
nerves of a "passed lawyer."  Such is human nature. That fellow&#xD;
had walked ten miles to see one or two valuable lives thrown away,&#xD;
and would have gone home most awfully disappointed, if one of the&#xD;
combatants had not bit the dust; yet, for the safety of a little worth-&#xD;
less five, not worth ten bits, he came pretty near taking a fit.&#xD;
At last order was restored, and Bob Smith taking up his position,&#xD;
on a small hillock to the left of- the principals, sung out, "one-&#xD;
two-.-." here you could have heard a pin drop; some of the spectators&#xD;
turned away, some -involuntarily covered their eyes, but for the honor&#xD;
of Redatick, I must say, by far the greater portion gazed fixedly at th&#xD;
one they calculated was sure to drop, when ",three-fire !" broke the&#xD;
awful silence, and pip! pip! went the caps on each pistol. The crowd&#xD;
once more rushed up, atiid the seconds took the pistols and examined&#xD;
them attentively. After. placing fresh caps upon the nipples, the&#xD;
dietauce was narrowed down-to ten paces at the request of the excited&#xD;
&#xD;
SCENES IN THE SOUTH.&#xD;
p-incipals, who were worked up into a perfect fit of rage oy the many&#xD;
interruptions; and Bob-once more took up his position, with his left&#xD;
hand gracefully placed under his swallow. coat tails. Just as he&#xD;
opened his mouth to give the word, another melee took place among&#xD;
the crowd, this time occasioned by two bull-dogs, who knew no better&#xD;
than to fight at such a time and place. As they belonged to two rival&#xD;
butchers, who had made a match between the- dogs to come off the&#xD;
succeeding evening, of course Bob had to stop until the uproar, ceased.&#xD;
There he stood upon the little mound, a perfect picture of impatience&#xD;
upon a monument, with one hand extended. He had just turned&#xD;
around to give the word anyhow, when bang, bang went a double-&#xD;
barrel among the crowd, and Bob sprang ten feet in the air. We&#xD;
rushed up to him as he Jay extended on the ground on his face, and&#xD;
lifted him up; the back part of his unmentionables about ten inches&#xD;
below his back; were perfectly perforated with something a good deal&#xD;
finer than "mustard-seed shot," which we afterward found out was a&#xD;
full load of salt, that proceeded from the gun ofan overseer, who had&#xD;
been attracted from a neighboring field where he was watching for&#xD;
sugar-cane thieves," in the shapeof boys; and getting uptripped in&#xD;
the melee, as a natural consequence, he fell on his gun, which going&#xD;
off caused the mischief.&#xD;
The dickens was to pay now, and I tried ineffectually to get the&#xD;
duel postponed, but no, fight they would, and I took Bob's place as&#xD;
second to Dick. Standing upon the same mound, with, I acknowledge,&#xD;
a slight feeling of fear lest the prominent position I occupied might&#xD;
draw upon me the ,consequences consequent upon another accident&#xD;
among the crowd taking place, I gave the word, and pip! pip! burst&#xD;
the caps again. We were extremely surprised at this repetition, and&#xD;
going up to them, we underwent a series of curses both loud and&#xD;
deep.&#xD;
Aint any one got a pair of decent pistols ?" exclaimed the two&#xD;
worthies, as they eyed us scornfully, as if we had anything to do with&#xD;
the non-explosive qualities of the powder. But no, no two had pistols&#xD;
alike, and we proceeded to prime and shake the powder down into the&#xD;
tubes.&#xD;
Once more they took their positions, and giving the word, pip, pip,&#xD;
went the confounded caps. At this juncture, Dick seized a little stick,&#xD;
run it down the barrel of his pistol, and lo! it was empty; Mac dis-&#xD;
covered his was the same, and both being suddenly taken with a each-&#xD;
inatory fit, they rushed up and shook eaph other heartily by tho&#xD;
hands. The seconds were so wrought up with excitement that they&#xD;
had forgotten to load the Pistols, each thinkingthe other had attended&#xD;
to that little matter, and so it ended. What bets that were not with-&#xD;
drawn, were turned over on to the dog fight which was to come of&#xD;
the next day. The dogs being nick-named respectively Dick and Mae.&#xD;
I am sorry to have to. record the fact that Dick chawed up Mao&#xD;
awf lly; as for us-well, we sung "we won't go home till morning,"&#xD;
and we 'didn't. 1edstibk was alive that night.&#xD;

it good humoredly, only swearing by all that was good and lovely,&#xD;
to be even with us all before a twelve-month:; how well he kept his&#xD;
promise, good reader, you will find out before you finish this volume&#xD;

A few weeks after the "affair of honor," court commenced in Red-&#xD;
stick, and Mac and I had several cases. to be put through, besides&#xD;
which, the grand jury had presented the whole population: of a dis-&#xD;
trict entitled "Devil's: Swamp," and we were certain to have some-&#xD;
thing to do in the,matter, either as prosecutors or defendant's counsel.&#xD;
It seems that that whole district were up in, arms against each other,&#xD;
from some cause, no one knew what; but as the swamp lay adjoining&#xD;
the Mississippi river,'and as flat-boats- bad began to "come down"&#xD;
from the "upper country" with cargoes of which "old rye" formed&#xD;
by far the greater portion, the origin andiperpetuation of the disturb.&#xD;
ance may pretty. well be guessed at.&#xD;
I may as wdll here inform the reader, that the bench and bar of&#xD;
Redstick county, or rather parish, as they are called down South, was&#xD;
composed of "Old Judge Peasly," presiding justice, the, prosecuting&#xD;
attorney, who was called, from his claiming descent from John Ran.&#xD;
dolph, Pacahontas, and. another distinguished F.F.V., by the singu-&#xD;
lar cognomen of "Small Bug," two other lawyers who, resided in&#xD;
Pumpkin Hollow, and who rejoiced in the names of Blaze and Cinders,.&#xD;
and your two humble servants. The 'old judge, was a rip snorter in&#xD;
his way, and when a little fun was going on intcourt, generallyjoined&#xD;
in and assisted the thing along.&#xD;
The first case called was "State of Louisiana, versus Hezekiah&#xD;
Swamprat and Wheeler Babtiste Bellzaire Poker." These two gentle-&#xD;
men appeared, and claiming the assistance of counsel, the judge-ap-&#xD;
pointed'Blaze and Mac, to defend, them; Cinders being retained to&#xD;
assist the prosecuting attorney, and I was left to take notes, and&#xD;
with your consent, Mr. Reader, here theyare: ,d,           s&#xD;
The first witness, called was a perfect type an appearance, dress&#xD;
and manners of the whole: compoodlement of them; drenged.in a,&#xD;
hickory shirt, slouched wool hat, and jenimima alone knows what&#xD;
kind of pants! face unwashed, hair unkempt, and his; manner em"&#xD;
boldened by raw whisky imbibed at the "Spread Eagle," which was&#xD;
contiguous to the courthouse; he was fair specimen of the free-&#xD;

Cross question ,-.-" Had apain in hi stumiek, sum wun hit him yarly&#xD;
in the, fight."&#xD;
The second witness stated "thar war several wery preticular fights,&#xD;
bAt he war too drunk tq see ar'ry on $m.&#xD;
The third witness said 'he "knowed thar war a gin'ral row, but&#xD;
s'tween who he'd be hanged ef he could tell, as he had been a eating&#xD;
of pickled keowoumbers, and, was suffrin the usual consekens.'&#xD;
Judge wanted to know what the usual consekePs were, but counsel&#xD;
for defense objected, as there were ladies present. Judge begge4&#xD;
pardon, said he forgot.&#xD;
Cinders for plainti f,-who had been eating pecans, arose ;nd sworq&#xD;
the question must be answered, and spreading himself, exclaimed:&#xD;
"Your honor, whenever the wings of the American Eagle are spread,&#xD;
there I there! your honor, an Aerican has the right to freely ex-&#xD;
presa himself."&#xD;
Mac, for defense, arose and majestically swooping his arm therebyy&#xD;
overturning an inkstand, for which after court he had to pay th&#xD;
sheriff two bits).said,"' that wherever under the Star Spangled Ban-&#xD;
ner and shade of the Constitution there were ladies, their presence&#xD;
was respected."  Here he was interrupted by a cheer from tw9&#xD;
little "niggers," who were immediately chased by the deputy sheriff&#xD;
into the wide-open door of the Spread' Eagle, although they took v&#xD;
contrary dirotion,&#xD;
" That where beauty was present, man    Ad man's law mud&#xD;
succumb."&#xD;
Here, to the surprise of everybody, ope of the ladies immediately&#xD;
fainted, I say surprise, for "Devil's Swanp," where these ladies&#xD;
came from, was far more celebrated fgr the Wop4-chopping qualifica-&#xD;
tions of its feminines than for fainting proppAsities,  She wasjr&#xD;
however,, brought to by rubbing On old segar violently up and down,&#xD;
her nose.&#xD;
The whole question was settled by proving that no American flag&#xD;
ever was seen in Devil's Swamp; that instead of eagles, turkey bus-,&#xD;
sards were the prominent game in that section of the country. B4&#xD;
to compromise, the question was- -asked differently, after removing&#xD;
the ladies to the back room, so as to be out of reaeh of the consekviU,;&#xD;
Judge, asked witless "what effect had the cucumber ?"&#xD;
Witness-" They set py teeth on aidge."&#xD;
general uproar-4-Zhe deputy found both ladio looking through a&#xD;

The ext witnep was called in haste, _*d the judge asked him.&#xD;
where he was at the time.&#xD;
After hesitating a 14oment, he replied:&#xD;
"Well, you see, jedge, I was sorter 'hind the ohicken-ep."&#xD;
"Why, what were you doing there?"&#xD;
"Well, we hadn't had noliquorefor four wr- five days, and Oe Qi &#xD;

"No swearing in court!" thundered the old judge.&#xD;
"I begs a thousand pardins, jedge; I only meant God dirn."&#xD;
"Well go on."&#xD;
"Well, as I said aforesaid, I picks up the jug and gins it a natural&#xD;
twist, and I'll be God--I begs yer pardin, jedge-I mean God dirn-&#xD;
I 'sure you I do," continued the witness, in an agony of fear. "I&#xD;
didn't mean to say it, jedge, I'll be d--- if I did-.&#xD;
"Shut your clatter, and go on," shouted the judge, getting as mad&#xD;
as blazes.&#xD;
"Well, you see, I kept one eye skinned on the crowd, cos they&#xD;
was pitchin rails and cord-wood all around; en I thought, by jings--&#xD;
jememmima! I oily meant God dirn-I 'sure you I did."&#xD;
"Go on with your story, confound you!" yelled the excited judge.&#xD;
"Well, hold on, jedge; don't kick 'bout it this time. Well, ez you&#xD;
know, I riz the jug to my mouth and took most a-a-a God dirn swig--&#xD;
and, I'll be did-did-diddy dog gonned ef some puke hadn't gone and&#xD;
filled the jug full or turpentine."&#xD;
"Discharge that witness, Mr. Sheriff " exclaimed the judge, "and&#xD;
place his name, if he's got any, on the list of exempt jurQrs, wit-&#xD;
nesses and tax-payers; and if you ever summons him to appear be-&#xD;
fore me Iagain, I'll commit you for contempt of court. Bring on&#xD;
the next."&#xD;
This gentleman was matrimonially connected with one of the ladies&#xD;
in court, and was as jealous as a swamptick. The first question was:&#xD;
"What is the character of Mrs. Pawpaw ?"&#xD;
"Here the judge winked at the deputy to take the ladies in the&#xD;
back room, as he didn't want any more fainting. The deputy, in' at-&#xD;
tempting to remove the ladies, was met by fierce looks from the lady&#xD;
who wanted to faint, so she could hear the evidence. Deputy placed&#xD;
his hand on the lady who uttered a faint squeal ; the husband, who had&#xD;
been talking like blazes about the Dovil's Swamp Railroad, and the&#xD;
price of turtles, turned his head suddenly, and seeing the state of&#xD;
affairs, rushed up to his honor, and pointing his finger at the shrink-&#xD;
ing deputy, roared out:&#xD;
"I am a free-born American citizen, and by Davy Crockett, I won't&#xD;
allow any man to intrude on the premises of my prem'tion right."&#xD;
Tremendous excitement-deputy fainted ; took him over to the&#xD;
Spread Eagle; returned eating a chunk of cheese.&#xD;
!1'he next witness refused to answer.- Said "he'd been 'spressin his&#xD;
pinion before and had got wollopped like thunder for it, and he&#xD;
would'rit run the risks, unless the judge would give bonds to take a&#xD;
piece." This the judge emphatically declined doing, and as the wit-&#xD;
ness was too triffling to commit for contempt, he was discharged.&#xD;
Small ug then spoke an hour, and was followed by the balance of&#xD;
'the lawyers who spoke two hours more, during which time the judge&#xD;
went to -sleep; the listeners, adjourned to the Spread Eagle; the&#xD;
depity and constable played poker in the back room; lawyers ended;&#xD;
Judge awoke with a snort; the deputy snatched up the cards, consta-&#xD;
ble pocketed the small change, and-the case was kicked out of court.&#xD;

The next case called was one very similar in. everything except the&#xD;
evidence, and from the fact of defendant, a woman, being accused of&#xD;
whipping two individuals at once, Bill Smith and his wife, the reader&#xD;
will observe the similarity atla glance.&#xD;
The heroine of this affair, Miss June Bug, appeared in couri&#xD;
dressed in a faded calico, which Blaze, in his appel to the jury, cone&#xD;
strued to be immaculate white.&#xD;
She was supported on either side by the deputy and constable,&#xD;
which latter's eyes were as red as a sick rabbit's,-from what cause&#xD;
no one knew,-some said he had no control over his "phelinx,"-'&#xD;
others, less romantic, declared, the cause laid in the fact that the&#xD;
Spread Eagle had raw onions for desert at breakfast that morning, of&#xD;
which the honorable constable had partaken-rather freely.&#xD;
The first witness called was a gentleman with a complexion the&#xD;
color of autumn leaves and an abdomen "too numerous to mention7'&#xD;
Upon being interrogated and asked to tell a straight story, com-&#xD;
prising all he knew about the affair, he comnienced:&#xD;
"Wall, you see squar, I war fast asleep the night of this here frayi&#xD;
and warnt thinking of anythink in particular, and dreaming 'bout 4&#xD;
heap of things in gin'ral, when I earn a noise sich as made my har&#xD;
stan' straight out, which is the case every time I'm waked, which you&#xD;
know, is cause Im rather-..-"&#xD;
" We don't want to know what you are, all we want to know is what&#xD;
you know of this affair," interrupted the judge.&#xD;
Here Blaze, for defense, objected; said he might communiotte&#xD;
something of importance.&#xD;
Small Bug, for prosecution, referred to page 687, Book III of the&#xD;
Black-Snake War, and quoted: "When a personal compact comes in&#xD;
contact with a regular contract, local consequences forces witness to&#xD;
retract." Witness, who was sortei dumfounded, exclaimed, "that&#xD;
any one who said a horse-rack had hit his catarack was a-a-(here&#xD;
a fierce look frodi Small Bug)-mistaken."&#xD;
Judge.-" Go on, witness, what you know, say; and what you don't&#xD;
know, don't say."&#xD;
Witness.-"Well, as I said afore, I stepped out of doors, and thar&#xD;
I seed two critters a ginning of each other particular scissors; it was&#xD;
so dark at fus I couldhardly tell who' they war; at fus I thought they&#xD;
war a couple of catamounts a hevin'a little duel in ny yard, arthen&#xD;

&#xD;
flere Blaze sgain inerrupted the witness,,d asked the court and&#xD;
ury, what credence could be placed in a witness who would deliber'&#xD;
etely assert that he had been kngqkod down by a bat.&#xD;
Small Bug immediately referred to vol.5 Baron Humbug's Materia&#xD;
Medical, page 975, to prove that a vampire bat has been known to&#xD;
kill a man. .&#xD;
"Then you assert, sir," demanded Blaze, "that i vampire bat is&#xD;
all the same as a Louisiana bat."     ...&#xD;
" Certainly, sir, and I can prove the similarity. Here, sir, the&#xD;
immortal Baron Humbug-says a bat's a .at all the world over."&#xD;
"I suppose you will admit then, that a bug's a bug all the world&#xD;
over ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, sir; the same authority says so, and I am content to&#xD;
rest the reception or rejection of the evidence upon Humbug's works&#xD;
slone.".                                 .                ,&#xD;
" Then, your honor, I demand that his evidence (the witness's)&#xD;
be not received, for here, your honor, in Whoop-poles Commentaries,&#xD;
page 266: 'that where the proseentor's evidence, or any other evi-&#xD;
danoe, proceeds from anything that bears any resemblance in person&#xD;
or any other manner, with the parties engaged, the witness's testimony&#xD;
must be thrown out.' ThQ honorable gentleman admits that a bats&#xD;
a bat all the world over and that a bug is a bug, et similibu8; there.&#xD;
fore, I demand that as my client bears the oame of Bug, and the&#xD;
evidence he offers is humbug, that the witness's testimony be thrVn&#xD;
out." Granted by the astounded judge, who looked around for the&#xD;
witness to throw him out, but witness was already around to the&#xD;
Spread 'Eagle. : The deputy gladly obeyed the order to go:and bring&#xD;
i6 in. In a few minutes the witness was brought back, and upon&#xD;
being requested to explain about the bat, said:&#xD;
" Oh! yes, It was a bat,----W4ll, you see, as I said afore, it was a&#xD;
&amp;amp;ri-Iaka (great sensation) hit me on the soekedyput and blazed me.&#xD;
Weg, I come to arter a while, and I went to stop the fight, for my&#xD;
old ooman was gitten picked up awfully. I didn't like to interfere&#xD;
much, for, thinks I to myself, ef June Bug can whip her, I know she&#xD;
can. whip me, for my old *oman caoaelan roe out; therefore, I pro-&#xD;

"Well," continued the witness, 't anyhow, that I staid all nighi,&#xD;
suff'rin acute sensibles, fer the blasted wimmin never onme back.&#xD;
Thar I staid yelping and squalling through the long Buena Vista's of&#xD;
the night, as Blaze said just now in his speech, running round and&#xD;
round the stump till I trod on a snaik, or suthin like, for I never&#xD;
stopped to see, and I gin a big jumb and a holler like a railroad&#xD;
whistld, and I war loose. I never stopped runnin till I fetched up at&#xD;
Redstick.-Had to get on a pillow ever since.&#xD;
The next witness was for the defense, and he stated that he wat&#xD;
one of the fellows as did know all about it.&#xD;
. "I was a going along the road and I seed old Pumpkin Head a&#xD;
rakin in his fields and as I owed him a whipping, I hollered to him ef&#xD;
he would come out I would thrash him until his hide would do for a&#xD;
meal bag. With that he gin a yell and come at me full tilt, but I&#xD;
fixed him. I fell on my hands and knees jes. before he got to m6,&#xD;
and he fell, not over me as I expected, but right on to pof me, and th!&#xD;
way he gin me scissors was a sin to black snaiks. Well, I hollered&#xD;
nuff severil times, but he was so busy 'tending to my carcass that he&#xD;
had no time to tend to my hollerin. At last one of the field hands&#xD;
come and pulled him off, but he come dirn slow; I tell you, he walked&#xD;
as easy as if he was treading on eggs, but he pulled him off-and I&#xD;
had some business to attend to home and so I left."&#xD;
Other witnesses were examined, but neither the ingenuity of Blaze&#xD;
nor the eloquence of Small Bug could get a word relative to the case&#xD;
in question out of them. The jury retired and gave a verdict iti&#xD;
favor of Miss June Bug, the defendant, with one dollar and six bits&#xD;
damages, that being the assessed value of the calico dress lost and&#xD;
ruined in the fight.&#xD;

fame, or wealth, or both, and I'll be hanged if I don't push my legal&#xD;
and financiering abilities to the utmost to procure them both."&#xD;
" Well, sir, I have no objection to your swallowing more than your&#xD;
share, providing you don't swamp your 'bark of happiness' in the&#xD;
successful prosecution of your object."&#xD;
"'No, Hal, my bark of happiness shall never sink. As long as&#xD;
there is fun out, you shall hear my yelp in the chorus."&#xD;
"I expect your yelping would assume a sharper tone if the thought&#xD;
pf a disagreeable, cross, ugly wife waiting for you with a keen tongue&#xD;
at home, should happen to flit across your mind in the mqidst of your&#xD;
merriment; but I see by your Yankee clock 'tis time to fix up and go&#xD;
and see our lady loves. I'll come around for you at seven, Mac; till&#xD;
then aw'revoir."&#xD;
Among the multitude of our lady acquaintances there were two&#xD;
with whom Mac and I were equally respectively smitten. Miss Clara&#xD;
and Miss Estelle Smythe were new comers in our burgh, and we were&#xD;
among the first male acquaintances with the father of Miss Clara&#xD;
and uncle of Miss Estelle, for they were cousins. They inhabited a&#xD;
beautiful place about four miles from town, and as they were reputed&#xD;
immensely wealthy, of course, we were not the only Richmonds in&#xD;
the field. Mr. Smythe, Esq., was a cioss, rabid old customer, and&#xD;
believed in duelling and cowhiding as the only remedies for wounded&#xD;
honor; and, indeed, such was his reverence for field practice, that&#xD;
rumor assigned some six or seven duels to the old cuss, (I hope he'll&#xD;
,never read this)-and the civil code was as nothing compared with&#xD;
his mode of setting affairs.&#xD;
About his wealth there was not a shadow of doubt, and unfortu-&#xD;
nately for me there was considerable expressed relative to the at first&#xD;
reputed wealth of Miss Estelle.&#xD;
Mac had fallen head over heels in love with Clara, but she did not&#xD;
give him any extraordinary hope of success; and, in fact, viewing&#xD;
the state of his affairs, from the ground upon which I stood, I ad-&#xD;
vised him several times to give up the game, and retire from the field ;&#xD;
but he obstinately persisted, and informed me at the same time that&#xD;
his view of my case with Estelle was -very similar to the one I ex-&#xD;
pressed in regard to his-and to tell the trith I did not meet with&#xD;
that success which vanity bid me expect.&#xD;
Driving up in a borrowed buggy, I received* Mac into the vehicle,&#xD;
and giving the reins to the dappled gray, which I had borrowed from&#xD;
Colonel Peter Wadd, with whom, gentle reader, I hope to make you&#xD;
better acquainted before you close this combined work of art, nature,&#xD;
and fill up the gap, dear reader, according to the views you&#xD;
entertain of the case, as old Jutige Horsecatcher remarked to the jury&#xD;
when the principle witness in a law-suit took a fit in court. Giving&#xD;

the evening chained our tongues and we forgot our plans for the evo-&#xD;

It was almost as light as day, and as we rolled along, the cool,&#xD;
shining, white, dusty road, stretched away before us, hedged in be-&#xD;
tween two green walls of Cherokee rose not unlike a splendid white&#xD;
carpet fringed with glossy-green fleckered along the border with the&#xD;
white stars of the hedge-rose.&#xD;
Away to our right and left stretched the magnificent fields of cane&#xD;
and cotton, the rows of which opened and shut as we rolled silently&#xD;
on as if by magic; far over to the right, a dark fringe of woods&#xD;
closed the scene, on that' side, along. in the dark shade of whioh,&#xD;
gleamed the bright ball of fire of the still-hunter, as he proceeded&#xD;
along the verge of the woods previous to disappearing amid its gloomy&#xD;
depths to scare up and slay the gentle deer; on our left, as far as the&#xD;
eye could reach, glittered the silver bosom of the Father of Waters,&#xD;
which here makes ond of those gigantic detours, called bends by the&#xD;
residents on its banks, and breasting its glittering surface came the&#xD;
booming, tearing steamer, under-whose bows the waters rolled up and&#xD;
dashed away in broad curves, that swiftly spread in her wake, until&#xD;
they dashed tumultuously-*against the banks on either side.  But,&#xD;
here we are at the gate of Old Smythe's semi park.&#xD;
"Now, mind your ps and qs, Mac, you know how dratted mad you&#xD;
made the old tiger the last time we were here,.by that foolish obser-&#xD;
vation of yours, 'that a man didn't no more mind killing his neighbor&#xD;
down South than sgiashing a flea.''"&#xD;
\ "Mind your own business, Hal; I've got a grand dose of flattery&#xD;
for him to night-the old Goliah."&#xD;
We were very coldly welcomed that evening by all hands, it seemed&#xD;
to me; 'though Mac dashed away with his confounded flattery as&#xD;
.usual. Early as we came, however, there were two before us, one&#xD;
of them a young, and, drat his picture, a very handsome lawyer,&#xD;
named Hall, who came out from Lemonskeclnr on purpose, as he said,&#xD;
to teach us two suckers the code of practice,. in the manner of getting&#xD;
a rich wife. He put up at the same hotel with us, and nearly run&#xD;
Mac crazy with his evident popularity with the softer sex. The other&#xD;
was Dick Foxy, who had taken a great notion for cutting me-out with&#xD;
Miss Estelle. We were rather a constrained party, with the exoep-&#xD;
tion of Mac and Hall, who set up to Miss Clara in a manner very&#xD;
indicative of a desire to outdo each other. I was seated at the center-&#xD;
table with Dick and Miss Estelle, who soon got over her coldness, and&#xD;
.with a watchful eye on papa, gave me some little assurance that she&#xD;
wished Dick and the balance of the party were anywhere else than in&#xD;
that particular room. By her manner she showed an evident fear of&#xD;
drawing upon her head her father's anger, by giving me any more&#xD;
attention than mere politeness required; and I watched the old man&#xD;
like a hawk to discover if possible the cause of his very evident&#xD;
distrust of Mac and myself.&#xD;
In the course of the conversation, Mac commenced bragging about&#xD;
his watermelon eating qualities, and went on with some of his, side.&#xD;
splitting anecdotes, relative to the good old times when he was aboy,&#xD;
and could indulge without the fear of the law before his eyes, im&#xD;

jifmpitng the fene of the neighbor# knd appropriating their largest,&#xD;
finest, and beet watermelons to his own use. As he rattled away, I&#xD;
noticed a peculiar knowing smile steal over the faces of Hall and&#xD;
Dick, and also a portetous cloud gathering about the contracting&#xD;
brows of Old Smythe; the young ladies turned pale, and Mae noticing&#xD;
the -change In the demeanor of the party, involuntary ceased in the&#xD;
naidst of a laughable story-at which, howeVer, no one ventured to&#xD;
'rack a-smile.&#xD;
Old Mr. Smythe rose up and made some severe remark about&#xD;
' what's bred in the bone is sure to come out in the flesh," and&#xD;
hobbled olit of the room. After setting a few moments, the party&#xD;
laboring, very evidently, under constraint, we arose and took our&#xD;
leave, together with Hall and Dick. As we emerged out on to the.&#xD;
spaoieus gallery in front of the house, we discovered that if we did&#xD;
hot hurry up our horses we should have to ride home, in the rain, for&#xD;
a sudden change had come over the face of nature, and deep, heavy&#xD;
clouds obscured the heavens on high, and the muttering thunders as&#xD;
they rolled and rumnbled overhead warned us to "cut stick and travel."&#xD;
It was so dark yoa could not seO yout- hand before your face, and I&#xD;
bstened to the buggy which was standing in company-withefall's&#xD;
before the gate. Getting in, I took up the reins and impatiently&#xD;
awaited the arrival of Mac, who unaccountably staid behind. One,&#xD;
two minutes rolled away, and the single occupant of the other buggy&#xD;
began to "cuss " in Dick Foxy's well known manner, and at a rate&#xD;
which indicated if Hall was not forthcoming in ten seconds, he'd have&#xD;
io foot it home. The pattering drops began to fall when the two&#xD;
worthies made tracks for the buggies; my companion sprang in, and&#xD;
drawing up the "leather role " in front, we give old gray the rein and'&#xD;
-Away we went.&#xD;
The rain came down in perfect floods, and we neither of us spoke a&#xD;
word. for the first mile or so, when my companion broke the silence&#xD;
In a joyous tone.&#xD;
"Dick, old fell," said he, "its all right, as sure as my name is&#xD;
aIl I'v got her. What do you think she did, by the holy poker?"&#xD;
Of course I made no answer and he rattled on.&#xD;
9' Well, sir, as soon as we got to the door, Miss Estelle bid us good&#xD;
night, and so didClara, and I thought they both went in the house,&#xD;
but by jings, she came up to me and drew me up behind the honey-&#xD;
suckle vine, and of her own accord gave me the sweetest kiss-Oh,&#xD;
erackee! Oh, jemima I just to think, and I would have left there to&#xD;
night, doubting that she loved me,.-"-what a fool I was. And aint&#xD;
she cunning ?  Them two sucker lawyers aint no whar. I'll be&#xD;
hanged if I don't eome out Sunday and propose. - And I'll tell you&#xD;
what, Dick, you shall be my overseer. Why don't you answer, con-&#xD;
found you.--Here we are though at the' hotel; come around to-.&#xD;
hirrow soon, ahd we'll talk over aboUt-jou know what! Say! hold&#xD;
on, I believe that confounded Mao was ietening behind the pillar of&#xD;
4he gallery. Well, he didn't hear anything consoling anyhow.--Good&#xD;
might., old fell."&#xD;
&#xD;
Bidding him good night in a muttered-tone, for I was a little dis-&#xD;
appointed at his easy success over Mac, I drove 'round to the stable,&#xD;
gave the h'rse, and buggy over to the boy in attendance, and, dripping&#xD;
Wet, hurried up to our room.&#xD;
When I entered, Mac was sitting before the fire in an easy chair,&#xD;
apparently absorbed in deep thought; his black eyes glittered,&#xD;
however, as I approached the fire, and he asked me in a tone of&#xD;
indecision:&#xD;
" Why did you halloo so, Hal, when you drove round to the stable ?&#xD;
I never heard such a yell in my life. If I hadn't known it was you,&#xD;
I could have sworn it was Dick Foxy-it sounded just like that whoop&#xD;
he gave when Bill Sand's horse fell down and took a fit after beating&#xD;
his sorrel. You aint so mighty glad at my success are you as to yell&#xD;
and halloo in that manner ?"&#xD;
" What are you talking about, Mac ?" I exclaimed,-"you didn't&#xD;
ride home with me."&#xD;
"The dickens I didn't; who did then ?" he exclaimed, jumping up&#xD;
and upsetting the chair.&#xD;
" Why, somehow or other Hall made a mistake and got in the same&#xD;
buggy with me."&#xD;
"Then, I rode home with Dick Foxy, and it is all over now; I&#xD;
suppose, I'm did and done for, that's certain !"&#xD;
"Why, what took place between you and Dick, anything wrong ?"&#xD;
"I should think thei-e was something wrong. The fact is, Ifal, I&#xD;
am the unluckiest devil born; ten minutes ago I was at the hight of&#xD;
human happiness; and now my happiness is alloyed by one of the&#xD;
most miserable accidents it has ever been my lot to encounter. You&#xD;
see, I!must have got in Dick's buggy, and Hall got in with you; and&#xD;
I, thinking I was talking to- you, let out my secret, and, of course, by&#xD;
to-morrow night, it wjll be all over the country, and Old Smythe will&#xD;
never let me enter his doors again, let alone Miss Clara, who will&#xD;
never believe me when I explain how it got out." Here a light began&#xD;
to steal over my bewildered senses.&#xD;
. " Go on, Mac, out with it man; between us both we'll manage to&#xD;
set the matter rioht."&#xD;
"If you set thi affair right you're smarter by far than I am. Let&#xD;
me explain first, and then let's see what you think of it. You see,&#xD;
when we came out, I thought to myself, now or never, and waiting&#xD;
until yqu all were gone out, I drew Miss Clara behind the vines that&#xD;
draped the gallery, and gaue and got the three streetest kisses that ever.&#xD;
Dreamed of. In getting in the buggy, such was my confounded&#xD;
hurry, that I triumphantly let it all out to Dick, who I thought was&#xD;
you-confound it! That was the reason he whooped and yelled so&#xD;
when I got out of the buggy; but I suppose it woudd have all leaked&#xD;
Otit, fot when I came off the gallery I stumbled over that slink _Iall&#xD;
who was mean enough td watch me."&#xD;
Here I couldn't control my feelings and literally roared out. Mac&#xD;
looked wild at me, and r-etnarking that "he didn't see anything funny&#xD;
to laugh at," angrily went to bed.&#xD;

Of course he saw nothing funny to laugh at, and I, keeping my&#xD;
secret, went to bed, and choking myself with the corner of the pillow&#xD;
case, laughed internally until my silent cachinnations shook the bed&#xD;
and room-Mac angrily tossing in bed and cursing me for everything&#xD;
he could think of.&#xD;
The next morning early, I went over to see Dick, and we, after&#xD;
laughing over the matter until our sides ached, mutually promised not&#xD;
to mention the matter to any one, but bide our time to let the thing&#xD;
out at the opportune moment.&#xD;
CHAP TXR XI.&#xD;
"Faint heart ne'er won fair lady."&#xD;
IN spite, of all our promises of secrecy, the story was too good to&#xD;
keep, and before Hall's promised Sunday came the thing was all over&#xD;
the country. Of course Hall and Mac ripped around like blazes, but&#xD;
that only made the matter worse for them; they swore it was an&#xD;
infernal lie, but that added fuel to the flame, and Mac at last urged&#xD;
me to accept an invitation of long standing from a friend of ours, to&#xD;
go out and spend a few weeks in hunting and fishing on his place.&#xD;
So, early one fine morning we packed up our traps, and, again in&#xD;
company with Hall and Dick, (who were also invited to the same&#xD;
place), we left for the hospitable mansion of our bachelor friend&#xD;
. olonel Petr Wadd, Esq.&#xD;
As his residence was some six miles from Redstick, and two from&#xD;
(Id Smythe's, Esq., we were situated just right, both in respect to&#xD;
ourting, and attending to calls made upon us by our few clients both&#xD;
in town and in the country. With large airy chambers; every luxury&#xD;
in the way of food and refreshment that could be procured'; enough&#xD;
crvants tramping at each of our heels to form a body-guard ; pleasant&#xD;
Soinpany, and an agreeable, hospitable host, you'd better believe we&#xD;
enjoyed ourselves in our holiday and relief from the contracted rooms&#xD;
and dusty streets of Redstick.&#xD;
The first day we spent in the woods hunting we were forced to&#xD;
leave the Colonel at home, a4 he did not feel well enough to accompany&#xD;
us, and would not hear to our remaining at home on his account.&#xD;
Striking into the woods at the-back of the Colonel's field, we pitched&#xD;
into the squirrels, and interrupted many a happy scene of courtship&#xD;
between the furry little aniftials with our' leaden messengers.&#xD;
Mac was lucky enough to down a splendid wild gobbler, and in a&#xD;
few moments we found ourselves in the midst of a splendid flock of&#xD;
them. Bang! bang! went our double-barrels, and the noble birds&#xD;
had been so little hunted and were so fat, thatin a quarter of an hoar&#xD;
we had downed twenty-four of them.&#xD;
This may surprise many incredulous! ones, but the fact is that deer&#xD;
and turkies are as plentiful in the southern portion of Louisiana as&#xD;
gver they were in the wilds of the West. In one instance a gentleman&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
SCENES IN THE SOUTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
43&#xD;
&#xD;
who ran away from the yellow fever, then raging in the city where&#xD;
be dwelt, killed twenty-four deer in twenty-five days, and that too&#xD;
within ten miles of a city of four thousand inhabitants. But this is&#xD;
immaterial to our subject,&#xD;
Heavily laden with game, we stopped' to rest behind a noble field&#xD;
of sugar-cane, which we ascertained,-from one of the field hands,&#xD;
belonged to our very respected old friend Mr. Smythe; and after&#xD;
-resting ourselves and eating as much sugar-cane as we wished, Mac&#xD;
disconnected his finest gobbler, and taking out his pencil wrote on the&#xD;
back of his card, his "compliments to Mr. Smythe, and begged as a&#xD;
favor his acceptance of part of the result' of the day's hunting."&#xD;
Attaching it by a string to the gobbler's neck, he called a negro and&#xD;
was proceeding "to send him up to the house, when we stopped the&#xD;
boy, pulled out our cards, and followed his example. Leaving the&#xD;
negro to make his way to the house with the four. turkeys, we&#xD;
proceeded on our way home, confidently expecting to receive an&#xD;
invitation to Mr. Smythe's in the course of the following day, to come&#xD;
over and assist in towing away the above-mentioned game.&#xD;
The next morning early, as we were sitting on the Colonel's spacious&#xD;
gallery, we observed Mr. Smythe coming up the road in his buggy,&#xD;
which stopped in front of the gate; and, as if in answer to Hall's&#xD;
whispered inquiry of us, "as to in what manner the surly old bugger&#xD;
would express himself in inviting us over to dinner,"' Old Smythe&#xD;
broke out on us with:&#xD;
"You are a pretty set of gentlemen are you not, you set of cow-&#xD;
ardly rascals! If my legs would permit me (looking angrily down at&#xD;
his gouty appendages) I would get out and hide you out of your skins,&#xD;
you miserable scoundrels. Drive on, John, I perceive that they can&#xD;
not take an insult-.rif any of you can screw your cowardly hearts to&#xD;
the sticking point, I am at your service and, by the Eternal, if one&#xD;
of you does not take up this matter and give me satisfaction, I will&#xD;
cowhide you all through the streets of Rcdstick."&#xD;
So saying, the old gent rolled off in his buggy leaving us com-&#xD;
pletely dumfounded.&#xD;
In the hope that by sending over the Colonel to apologize for&#xD;
anything we might unfortunately have done to disturb the harmony&#xD;
of the old rascal, we adjourned into the house to hunt him up.&#xD;
Upon informing him of what had occurred, he at once laid the&#xD;
cause to the fact of the old fellow's just hearing of Mac and Hall's&#xD;
kissing serape, and he advised us all 4o steer clear of the old gent&#xD;
until his anger cooled off, as he would. most assuredly attempt to put&#xD;
his threat in execution. With a merry laugh we adjourned to break-&#xD;
fast, where we feasted off of'one of'the glorious fat turkeys; twelve&#xD;
of which we had sent as presents to our friends in town, for fear cf&#xD;
their spoiling if we attempted to keep them on hand until gradually&#xD;
devoured.&#xD;
Toward the close of the day, as we were sitting in the same broad&#xD;
piazza, from which we viewed the old fellow's i potent anger in the&#xD;
morning, his boy John came up with a note for the young sontlemen,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7271-00000023"/>&#xD;
44&#xD;
&#xD;
REDSTIOK; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
which Hall, expecting it to be a challenge, passed over to each of us&#xD;
in succesion; and all of us refusing 'toropen it, he handed it to Colonel&#xD;
Wadd, who deliberately opening it read the contents, after which&#xD;
bursting into a roar of laughter, he dropped it on the carpet, and laying&#xD;
Limsel' full length on the sofad lie almost went into convulsions of&#xD;
laughter.&#xD;
Picking up the note  was almost thunderstruck at reading:&#xD;
Messrs. Hall, Foxy , Co.&#xD;
IN JoHN RANDOLPH SMYTHE Dr.,&#xD;
To 24-Turkeys, at $4 per pair, -  -   -    -   $48.00,&#xD;
Payment immediately expected.&#xD;
Was it possible-had we killed off twenty-four tame turkeys, and&#xD;
was this the upshot of our much-boasted-of hunt!&#xD;
No wonder the old fellow took the trouble to ride around on pur-&#xD;
pose to cuss at us. And then the idea of our sending him four of his&#xD;
own tame turkeys as a present, was too much for our risible muscles,&#xD;
and in spite of the prominent $48 staring us in the face, we were&#xD;
forced to burst out into peal after peal of laughter.&#xD;
fThe upshot of the matter was, John was sent home with a note,&#xD;
stating that one of the party would be over in the evening and settle&#xD;
for the turkeys, and as no refusal came, I went over after sunset with&#xD;
the stated amount of cash to pay up.I&#xD;
The number of apologies I made, and semi-insults I calmly took,&#xD;
would be of no interest to the reader; suffice it to say, the old fellow&#xD;
was at last so far mollified as to request me to make his apologies to&#xD;
the other three and there let the matter drop.&#xD;
He took the money, however, and we considered ourselves well off&#xD;
in getting out of the scrape as easy as we did, although he did get&#xD;
four of the turkeys and we had to pay him twice the amount we could&#xD;
have 'bought them for in Redstick.&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
ONE morning I was summoned to town, to attend to some business&#xD;
which detained me there for several days.&#xD;
Whilst busily engaged in writing one eveng, I interrupted&#xD;
the sudden entrance of an old gent, who generally went by the name&#xD;
of Uncle Jim.&#xD;
With a spirit wide awake to' any sort of fun, as he expressed it,&#xD;
and opposed to all lawing, he had come to request me, "Eff ar'y of&#xD;
his two boys, Billy and Jack, cum to me fur ar'y advice about suing&#xD;
each othed, to not have ar'ything to do with it, and to persuade 'em to&#xD;
drap the thing whar it war."&#xD;
I told him I would advise them not to have anything to do with&#xD;
myself or any other lawyer, and if I could prevent them, he might&#xD;
depend upon it that I would. tut set down, Uncle Jim, and let me'&#xD;
know what has disturbed the harmony of their intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
m-&#xD;
&#xD;
SCENES IN THE SOUTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
4A&#xD;
&#xD;
" Harmony be dirned," says Uncle Jim; "there never was ar'y bit&#xD;
uv harmony atween 'em, and thar's a heap less now. However, es I&#xD;
laughed enough at 'em you mout as well know about it." And he&#xD;
proceeded to inform me that having a job of kettle-setting, (setting&#xD;
sugar kettles in brick), he had started out with his two apprentiees&#xD;
for the plantation where they were to work. It was a bright clear&#xD;
morning, as the three drove out of town in Uncle Jim's neat one-&#xD;
horse wagon; but the boys were so enraged at each other that as&#xD;
Uncle Jim expressed it, "sich another cussin as they kep up I never&#xD;
hearn in all my life." It appeared that Billy' had placed a defunct&#xD;
chicken, who had darted this life some days previous, between the&#xD;
mattresses of Jack' ed, preventing his olfactories, as Jack said, from&#xD;
refreshing themselves with as sound a nap as the other members of&#xD;
his body, and keeping him awake, hunting and cussing the came of&#xD;
the unpleasant smell that pervaded his apartment.&#xD;
In his turn he had rewarded Billy's assiduous attention to his com-&#xD;
fort, by dosing his morning stiff 'ner with linseed oil, which caused&#xD;
such a pleasing sensation in his "innards" that he immediately gazed&#xD;
at his "breckfist" as it noisily' covered Uncle Jim's coat and pants,&#xD;
thereby causing that respectable old gent to maake some remarks not&#xD;
usually found in the Douay version.&#xD;
Woll, as they say in 'Massasip,' Jack cussed and Billy oussed, until&#xD;
Uncle Jim could stand it no longer, and breaking forthhe-shouted:&#xD;
- "Boys, you've worked with me more'n three year, and during that&#xD;
time I've hearn more cussin', more quarlin' an more noise, and seed&#xD;
less fighten' than I ever deemed two varmints could be guilty of. Now,&#xD;
its got to stop, and ef I hear one word more you got to fight it out&#xD;
when we get to the Colonel's."&#xD;
Of course this only added fuel to the flame, and -although theyhad&#xD;
exhausted nearly all of the cussin' vorcabulary before they reached the&#xD;
Colonel's, still they were in a splendid humor for a free fight, whea&#xD;
they reached the plantation. As they drove up the old Coloneliob-&#xD;
served that something was wrong, and being made acquainted with&#xD;
the cause, proposed a general shake hands all around. But no, their&#xD;
blood was up, and Jim swore that fight they must, and that.-right off&#xD;
too, as he wanted no more oussin' and wreulin'. But here a difegl.&#xD;
ty intervened. The Colonel was opposed to fist fighting, and as for&#xD;
dueling, Billy would fight with nothing but small swords. and Jack&#xD;
wanted muskets, trigger to, trigger, and foot to foot, The, old Color&#xD;
nel had but one musket, and. one sword on the place, sud things were&#xD;
in a worse state than ever, when Uncle Jim, after gaming abstractly at&#xD;
pile of fire-brick lying before the sugar-house, suddenly brightened up,&#xD;
.and made a proposition which struck all hands as singularly apposite&#xD;
to the occasion. It was for dach, of the combatants to strip ff, a.d&#xD;
catching each other by the left hand, to rub each other's hams with a&#xD;
uaarse fire-brick, held in their right, until one or 'the other cried,&#xD;
" Hold, enough." Things were duly arranged, and at it they went,&#xD;
the Colonel acting as Jack's second, and Uncle Jim as Billy's.&#xD;
After gently rubbing, each other for a moment, Jack gave a sharp&#xD;

rub,, which walked into Billy's hide, and provoked a shrill squeal and&#xD;
desperate exertion on the part of the gentleman to reciprocate the&#xD;
favor. In a short time skin began to peel and " taller" to come off&#xD;
in a manner which if agreeable to the Colonel and Jim, as expressed&#xD;
by their cachinnations, was death to the two gents who were giving and&#xD;
receiving satisfaction in this novel manner. At it they went, now on&#xD;
one side, now on the other, until wearied with pain and exertion, they&#xD;
with- one accord ceased their bloody work.&#xD;
" Are you satisfied ?" asked the Colonel, Es soon as h? could com-&#xD;
press his mouth into speaking compass.&#xD;
"No sir-ee" shouted Billy, springing to his fe t; "give me another&#xD;
brick."I&#xD;
" Mine's smooth," yelled Jack, as facing his adversary they each re-&#xD;
ceived 'a fresh brick from Uncle Jim, who absolutely yelled and&#xD;
squealed with laughter, for the bricks this time were literally covered&#xD;
with cayenne pepper, which Uncle Jim carried in his pocket as an&#xD;
anti-cholera specific.&#xD;
" Give the word, Uncle Jim," they both shouted, as they stood&#xD;
brick in hand ready to "pitch in and git skeezed."&#xD;
"Wait a minute," shouted Jim, "ha ! haw ! ha-u-u ! Oh Lordy ! ha!&#xD;
haw! git readyr! haw! haw! one-haw! oh haw! ha! two-he haw! oh&#xD;
haw! three!'' he spasmodically yelled as he fell sprawling backward&#xD;
bursting his what-dye-call'ems in his frantic efforts to yell all over.&#xD;
Two or three scientific passes were made in the air, and then dowD&#xD;
came the bricks upon their bloody hams, and at it they went again.&#xD;
"Take him off!" shouted Jack after one or two rubs.&#xD;
"Nuff!" yelled Billy.&#xD;
"Nuff," they both yelled, and letting the bricks drop, away they&#xD;
went for the river, shouting and yelling at every jump, "Fire! fire!&#xD;
ice ! fire !" followed by Uncle Jhn and the Colonel who, though both&#xD;
tall runners, were distanced in the race.&#xD;
When they arrived at the bank, there stood the two duelists, up to&#xD;
their middles in the water, squealing and hallowing for oil, cotton and&#xD;
every other sedative they could remember. After hard begging they&#xD;
waded out until the water left their hips, when the air coming in con-&#xD;
tact with their peppered hides forced them to squat into the cooling&#xD;
element.&#xD;
How they got them out, Uncle Jim forgot to tell me, but one thing&#xD;
certain, they never fought agiin. Billy swore when he got out of bed&#xD;
three weeks afterward,-that Stagg &amp;amp; Shays' brand was distinctly vis.&#xD;
ible on his hips,, and that his hams were as well cured as any in the&#xD;
Cincinnati market. The brand was probably the name of the maker&#xD;
of the brick; but Jack swore he smelt fried ham every time he looked&#xD;
downward.&#xD;

straw-they 11 never do: "for briar and brush and thorny brake"&#xD;
will soon make sad havoc with the little beauties.&#xD;
'Twas the Fourth of July, and our little party were not a whit&#xD;
envious of the fun going on in Redstick, as announced by the cracking&#xD;
of fire-worka and ever and anon the sharp quick sound of the "Red-&#xD;
stick Invincibles'" piece of artillery, which blazing away was answered&#xD;
by the' cheers of the "ardent spirited spectators," aid by the lou4,&#xD;
crashing echoes of the woods, hills and valleys around.&#xD;
We were bound for the woods, and had a clear bill of lading for&#xD;
that port, with our full cargo of fun fully insured, and a copy of&#xD;
the policy fully imprinted upon the face of every laughing beauty&#xD;
present.&#xD;
You northerners, whose ideas of southern summer life are compre-&#xD;
liended in the fancy that man's whole duty during the burning days,&#xD;
is to protect himself from sunstroke, and at night from the legionary&#xD;
assaults, of hordes of well-disciplined, life-taking musquitoes, would&#xD;

in the cool sea breeze, that coming gaily over the pine-clad hills of&#xD;
the "Florida parishes," bowed the tall beflowered heads of the giant&#xD;
magnolia in theecooing, rustling acknowledgement of its pleasant&#xD;
embrace.&#xD;
Our little party comprised some twenty in number, of which by far&#xD;
the greater portion were of the fairer, softer sex.&#xD;
Dick Foxy, Mac, Hall and Colonel Purse (Miss Duchapell6s&#xD;
cousin) were of the party, and the rivalry between them all (including&#xD;
your humble servant) to cut each out (that is the most comprehensive&#xD;
term I can think of) was most intense.&#xD;
At length the belles of the party having quietly selected their&#xD;
beaux, and we the disappointed (for Estelle had given her basket,&#xD;
vail, etc., to Dick, and of course I was of that number) having offered&#xD;
our services to, whoever would have them, set out for the scene of&#xD;
our pic nie, which was to be on the banks of a lovely little lake some&#xD;
four miles from town.&#xD;
Our course was through the woods and we proceeded happily and&#xD;
gaily along, singing to the sound of a "light guitar " which Colonel&#xD;
Purse, "a la troubadour," carried hung by a broad blue 'ribbon around&#xD;
his neck.&#xD;
From all appearancesthis gentleman had made up his quarrel wiith&#xD;
Miss Duchapelle, and they were as loving as turtle doves.&#xD;
A prominent trait in his character I soon discovered to be. a vain-&#xD;

"Tigers " in Mexico.&#xD;
"4Well, Miss," responded the Colonel, twirling his moustaches of&#xD;
which, confound him, he had a most luxuriant black crop, "we were&#xD;
forced to, um-make an example of eome of those greasy individuals.&#xD;
Why, 'my dear Miss, when I was beset by seventeen of them in the&#xD;
Chingaringo pass, do you think if I had not slain the-um-beg palr'&#xD;
don ladies-reskels----that they would have had mercy on me ?-Most&#xD;
assuredly not!"&#xD;
At this juncture, we came to a halt upon.the gentle grassy slope of'&#xD;
one of those aboriginal mounds which lie scattered as mementos of a&#xD;
by-gone race over the broad highlands of Louisiana.&#xD;
Our resting "spell " was enlivened by -a couple of sgngs from the&#xD;
Colonel, accompanied by the everlasting guitar, after which he sang&#xD;
an impromptu (ding gon bim, he possessed almost every accolplish-&#xD;
ment) composed and dedicated to the girls on the spot-&#xD;
This capped the climax, and the girls were leaving us and clustering&#xD;
around him to hear one more, oh only one more, of those sweet songs,&#xD;
when a wild yell resounded through the crowd accompanied by louo&#xD;
shrieks from the girls, who scattered and fled from th Colonel in every&#xD;
direction. We hastened up to him as he stood on tiptoes, one arn4&#xD;
grasping the tree at the roots of which he hag been sitting, the other&#xD;
holding with a tenacious grasp something in his pants about the&#xD;
region of his knees as far out from his pedals Is his Paris pants would&#xD;
admit, and shrieking;&#xD;
' Great God!! a snaik! Help me quick, or it will bite! quick.!&#xD;
quick!&#xD;
"Pull off his pants," shouted Mac..&#xD;
"Retire, ladies, retire! " shouted Dick, which they did instanter-&#xD;
And then, and only then, we proceeded to trip the gentleman, for&#xD;
notwithstanding. hispcries to never mind the ladies, but off with his&#xD;
pants, we selfishly kept an eye open to number one. and waited, UnAti&#xD;
they had disappeared amid the tree-s.&#xD;
$eated on the ground, Dick tugged at one leg and Mac at the&#xD;
other, whilst the Colonel in an agony of fear kept his grasp tightly&#xD;
on the reptile-&#xD;
At length the pants came' off, the Colonel let go, and Mac, after&#xD;
esperate shaking, shook :out 9f one of the vacated legs a  iqle tree-&#xD;
frog, which Hall, in ozpectation of ita being a- ten feet rtlorsnake&#xD;

'The shouting and hallo3ing which this unexpected " turn up "&#xD;
brought on, enticed the girlsfro  their cover,for which they again&#xD;
broke upon observing the  oloel in lis ,drawers, pants inhandr&#xD;
cutting dirt for-" anywhere but here just then."&#xD;
After he got out of sight the 'ladies were recalled, and we proceeded&#xD;
en without our "hero of an hundred fights."&#xD;
'Arriving on the chosen ground, we found the table-cloth spread&#xD;
and viands already for disposal; .they having been sent. ont before&#xD;
as with a couple of negro boys to serve at this-'nature's table."&#xD;
That dinner! Oh,. that dinrer!- The less we  speak of it the&#xD;
better, for various reason-one, and one only of which. I will men&#xD;
tion is, that your humble servant imbibed. so- much "elder wine,'&#xD;
that somehow or other when he got up from the tsale, he mistook&#xD;
an; old cow for one .of the young ladies present, and offering her his&#xD;
arm, came mighty nigh viewing the country, from the tops of her&#xD;
horns.&#xD;
The little lake was surrounded by ,trees, whose boughs, covered&#xD;
with flowers, diooped into the still calm waters, which rippled when:&#xD;
the soft winds moved the gree! pendants, as if they smriled at the&#xD;
kisses of their flower-covered branches.&#xD;
From the green sward whereiwe sat arose in solitary majesty a&#xD;
giant, rugged magnolia, one arm of which stretched over the silent&#xD;
lake and laved 'its- tip in, its cool waters ; this branch was literally,&#xD;
covered with "bay flowers," and could be reached either by ascend&#xD;
ing the 'tree, or' swinging up into the branch, by means of a large&#xD;
grape-vine, which,itaking root at the foot of the magnolia, reached&#xD;
over the waters in a graceful curve up into the branches.&#xD;
At the request of Miss Estelle, I ascended the vineohand over hand,&#xD;
to procure some of the magnificent flowers for. her to weave into-.-&#xD;
do not now remember what;--.but, anyhow, I had obtained them, ba&#xD;
in coming down, just before getting clear'of the branches, my coat&#xD;
tails caught in them and there I was,--in a fix,.and a crowd, of 'bright&#xD;
eyes upon me, whose vision however was, dimmed by tears brought on,&#xD;
from excessive laughter.&#xD;
I could not go back, and to come down was impossible ; three times&#xD;
I essayed to do the..former, and three ties I failed. And once&#xD;
made a desperate efort to tear my coat tails loose from their en,&#xD;
tanglement, by frantic sayings of my 'body, but it was no go. Oh,&#xD;
how dratted inean I felt. I hallooed to Hall to get a long pole and&#xD;
entwine my coat tails; and aa fast. as his laughter would admit, hq&#xD;
posted for the wogds to proeura one, and we saw no more of hira&#xD;

SCENES IN THE SOUTH.&#xD;

&#xD;
Oh, Stiche!-little did .1 believe  when you recommended the&#xD;
stren th of that cloth,-how soon I would put its merits to the test. It&#xD;
stratehed fearfully, however, and lag I looked down into the glassy&#xD;
lake, I thought-a heap. Suddenly a bright-idea struck me, and after&#xD;
a desperate tug I removed one arm from the sleeve, and swinging&#xD;
around I caught hold of the limb, and then proceeded to remove my&#xD;
arm from the other sleeve. I was free. Hand over hand I c01&#xD;
down, and falling upon the sward, I lay the maddest, most furious&#xD;
being that ever clumb a tree.&#xD;
By this time. Hall had arrive4,-and after stating that he'd been&#xD;
almost to Redstick without finding a pqle, and as he'd as yet laughed&#xD;
none, he set down and proceeded to gratify his risible muscles, by a&#xD;
little extension, in which he was politely joined by the whole party.&#xD;
After resting my stiffened arns Ilumb back, unwound my coa, and&#xD;
coming down we set ouxt for home.&#xD;
Dick would now and then praise the quality of the cloth, of which&#xD;
my coat was manufactured, and set the whole party to laughing at my&#xD;
expense,," by requesting me to give him my tailor's card."&#xD;
1 We had nearly reached the edge of the woods, when Miss Ducha-&#xD;
pell, pointing with her tiny parasol to a large clump of bays which&#xD;
grew on the boughs of an immense magnolia, remarked "that it my&#xD;
unfortunate adventure had not cast a shade over the adventurous&#xD;
spirits of the gentleman, she would request that some knight of prow-&#xD;
ess and to fame unknown would' ascend and procure her those flow.&#xD;
ers."  We all, however, shook our head save Mr. Dick, who, remark.-&#xD;
ing that "coats were unfortunate" proceeded to denude himself of,&#xD;
that garment and with a wonderful facility dexterously clumb up the&#xD;
rounded sides of the "monarch of the forest." lie had proceeded&#xD;
by the aid of the lateral branches to the hight of some fifty feet,'&#xD;
*hen he came to a place where, for some twenty feet there were no&#xD;
.branches. However, as the body of the tree had here grown small&#xD;
enough, he proceeded to work his way up, by grasping his arms&#xD;
around the trunk .and "inch" himself up by degrees. Encouraged&#xD;
by the approving shouts from below, he had reached within about&#xD;
grasping distance of a'limb when his progress was stayed by one of.&#xD;
those immense clumps which often mar the smooth columnar appear-&#xD;
ance of large trees. Making a desperate exertion, he proceeded to&#xD;
surnount the difficulty, and had reached the middle of it when the&#xD;
rugged concentric rings catching in his, clothes :stayed his further&#xD;
progress. Encouraged however by the shouts from below, he made&#xD;
.a desperate effort, when lo! his unmentionables burst asunder and a&#xD;
broad streak of white, relieved the shining black of what was just be.&#xD;
fore'~iihote pair of panb&amp;amp;&#xD;
The scene below was indescribable, the ladies that didn't faint pu I&#xD;

gaininhimthis soubriquet. He was stealing-out of the room with one&#xD;
of my boots' in his hand, and feigning slumber, when he was gone I&#xD;
arose and walking across to Old Smythe's chainber, noiselessly awok&#xD;
him and requested him to come with me.&#xD;
Dressing in haste, he accompanied me out of his front gate, and&#xD;
around the orchard until we came to a part of the fence not fifty feet&#xD;
from the trap, and there we sat and watched. Smythe was so anxious&#xD;
to catch the rascal that he never uttered a complaint, 'although his&#xD;
gouty feet twinged him awfully.&#xD;
We had waited about an hour, when no one appearing, I was about&#xD;
to commence making excuses for our bootlegs errand, when we observed&#xD;
a figure stealthily 'stealing across the lot. toward the trap; when he&#xD;
got within about twenty yards of it he dropped on 'his hands and&#xD;
knees, behind a row of cabbages, and disappeared.&#xD;
In a few moments his head appeared along side- the .frame work of&#xD;
the trap, and then he raised himself up and peered cautiously around-&#xD;
Satisfied that no one was observing him, e raised his hand,. and the*&#xD;
his object. was plainly perceptible; it was, to place my boot ito the&#xD;
trap, and thus fasten the suspicions of Old Smyth  on me in such 4&#xD;
manner that it would be almost impossible for me to exonerate&#xD;
myself.&#xD;
Mr. Smythe wanted to-rm up and make a sure game of it by catchi.&#xD;
ing the fellow, but I held himdown and in a moment'we were saved&#xD;
the trouble of running after him, for, the noise we made attraetsd his&#xD;
attention, and he having his arm.a the leg of the boot, shovedit su4.&#xD;
denly down on the spring-a diatter of the jaws of the ti-ap and a&#xD;
suppressed yell from the enterprising individual, informed us that our&#xD;
game was safe.&#xD;
,Approaching him openly across the garden, the efforts he made t&#xD;
get loose would have soon succeeded had I not run up and grabbel&#xD;
him.- He was powerfully. built and could, have mastered me in, a long&#xD;
struggle if the old man's yells of triumph had not brough,.t ho whole&#xD;
household (with the exception of Hall and Dick who had gene to pass&#xD;
the night at Colonel Wadd's) to the -spot. We got -him down and&#xD;
timing his hand and feetwe carried him to! thehouse in a kipd of tri .'&#xD;
umphal procession, and there holding a candle to his face behold--&#xD;
Mr.'Dick Foxy--caught at last in his own 'trap.&#xD;
The "old man " turned him;loose deeming, an#d justly too, that hp&#xD;
was punished enough, and he went back to-Redstick and joined the&#xD;
Humane Society. As for Mao and I--well, we got along well enough&#xD;
after that.&#xD;

John Gelon was a cousin to the Smnythes, and toward the close of&#xD;

John loved and was beloved in return, and his betrothed was in&#xD;
every way worthy of him. Lovely and unassumingshe "breathes not&#xD;
her fragrance on the desert air," for fa anid near her loveliness had&#xD;
gained her the appellation of "Mary the flower 6f. Attacapas."&#xD;
It was the sununier of the year, in the wiriter of which they were&#xD;
to be united, and John and his cousin Ben had been in town to lay in&#xD;
a supply of goods for farm purposes,&#xD;
There was a political meeting in town that day, and John and Ben&#xD;
both started home drunk! yes, drunk ! start 'not, gehtle reader, for&#xD;
intemperande in those days was not then deemed the crime with&#xD;
which we naturally-stamp it now.&#xD;
They started'home drunk; and I will now narrate, in his own&#xD;
words, what took place from thence until the moment when he ended&#xD;
his days -of happiness and gave birth to the "foul fiend" that from&#xD;
thence ruled with iron grasp every throb of his heart.&#xD;
I give you his words,, but I Oannot portray the agony of that&#xD;
ptulrned countenance ; the ashy paleness of that noble broW*,nor pic-&#xD;
ture to you the world of concentrated misery gleaming from his deep-&#xD;
sunken eye. 'Tis a warning I have never forgot. I have shunned&#xD;
the maddening bowl, and when forced by friends to partake in the&#xD;
social glass, whilst lifting the ruby contents to my lips, oft have&#xD;
I started shrinking back, for tihereI there!. daguerreotyped in its&#xD;
blood-red circle was the warning face of that remorse-struck man.&#xD;
"We started reeling home and had reached the broW' of the hill over&#xD;
against which was the house of Mary's father, and there we stumbled&#xD;
against a giant root, which ran across the road and fell to the&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
"fHow long we lay there I know not,'but I at length arose, and&#xD;
spurning my companion in the face with my heavy heel, I staggered&#xD;
on to Mary's hone.&#xD;
. "Arrived at the door', I 'was met by Mary herself. At the sight of&#xD;
the, I thought she burst into a mocking laugh, and rising from the&#xD;
ground (for I had again fallen at full length) I hurriedly drew my&#xD;
'revolver' and madly fired into the open door.&#xD;
"One loud, piercing shriek, was the answer to my message of death&#xD;
and I stood as if benumbed irr eveiy limb; the air was darkened to&#xD;
my bewildered senses, and I prayed-Oh, how swiftly shot the mental&#xD;
prayers though my bewildered brain that 'I only had been dreatn-&#xD;
ing.' But no-like the chaid"bolt of lightning, the bright flood of&#xD;
consciousness of ,he crinae I had cormitted, flowed over my middened&#xD;
soul, and I stood with the brand of Cain not stamped upon my brow;'&#xD;
but deep, deep into 1My cringingeoul went the hot iron of conviction&#xD;
that I was the murderer of iy o*h' dear-Mary.&#xD;
"They led me uiresisting tothe parish jail, and laid me dow upon&#xD;

Again I sunk unconscious upon the floor, and horrid semi-dreams beset&#xD;
my stricken mind.&#xD;
"Methought the beating rain was the tears of my Mary in heaven,&#xD;
and I prayed to her for forgiveness, and then the driving rain dashed&#xD;
into :ny face, and I dreamed that I was dead.-&#xD;
"I was before my Creator, and dark imps vere impatiently waiting&#xD;
to carry my soul into the realms below; an  then fancy brcught my&#xD;
wandering mind back to ,my 'body.as it ay cold and dead, and I&#xD;
dreaned I was rotting on the gallows and could even smell my putrid&#xD;
body---when with a yell I awoke. and there I lay at the foot of the&#xD;
hill where I had fallen, with Ben laying across me, his mouth open,&#xD;
my face covered with something smelling more of whiskey than of ottar'&#xD;
of oses, and, gentle reader, you can imagine the rest.&#xD;
' The way we two walked into Mary's buckwheat cakes and lasses&#xD;
that night was a sin to black snaix."&#xD;
Reader, I was fooled, and so were you; confound him, I -hear you&#xD;
say-but do not. He had cause for his melancholy, he mused not&#xD;
alone in the woods for nothing, nor shunned his fellow-man without'&#xD;
reason; for what man would associate with one who had just been&#xD;
elected to the Legislature.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
"If you want to get her, don't stand back like a dratted fool."&#xD;
"How TO, GET A Rica WI.'"&#xD;
Tiul epidemic was drawing to a close, and our residence in the.&#xD;
country must soon cease, and yet. I could not screw up the courage&#xD;
necessary to popping the final question.,&#xD;
The fact was, Estelle had not given me any extraordinary encour-&#xD;
agement, and' I was sorter kinder 'fear'd to venture, and the day.&#xD;
came upon which we had determined on returning to town without&#xD;
anything being done in the premises. As for Mac, he was in no&#xD;
better fix, if anything a good deal worse, for Hall had returned to the&#xD;
charge like a hero and was getting ahead of Mac " hand over foot."&#xD;
Our partings were cool and courtly,: and I left with the deep&#xD;
certainty impressed' upon my mind that I had left no "weeping maid,&#xD;
behind."&#xD;
We returned to town, and soon fell into the ordinary routine of&#xD;
study, eat and sleep; and on Sundays any one riding by Old Smythe's&#xD;
could see standing before the gate, at any time of day, two buggies,&#xD;
the owner of which were "pushing their fortunes " within the house.&#xD;
One evening I received so much encouragement that I determined&#xD;
upon returning during the following week and settling the matter for,&#xD;
better or for worse. And when the evening-I had picked upon rolled&#xD;
around, I mounted, and away I sped, not on the wings of love, but&#xD;
upon the back of the hardest trotter it has ever been my lack to&#xD;
mount.&#xD;
&#xD;
SCENES IN ,TUE SOUTH..&#xD;
Arrived at the house, I entered there door in a "state of feeling" as&#xD;
comparatively pleasant as those that sway the heart of the convict as&#xD;
he enters for the first time his "felon cell."&#xD;
I had entered the same door a hundred times before, but never with&#xD;
the dire intent of the present instance. Walking into the parlor, so&#xD;
lost was I to all presence of mind, that I saluted a black servant girl&#xD;
who was dusting the furniture as Miss Estelle.&#xD;
And then when she entered, in all the majest which conscious&#xD;
beauty gave to her form, my heart dropped from te, position it had&#xD;
taken up in my throat down, down, away down into my ".stumick,"&#xD;
and then rising again it lodged underneath the root of my tongue,&#xD;
paralyzing that useful member and choking my utterance.&#xD;
There I sat, and if " Tom Owen" had stood ,a4need of a subject to&#xD;
set as a "detected chicken thief," how very well I would have&#xD;
answered the purpose.&#xD;
I took no advantage of the opportunity and after saying something&#xD;
I do not now remember what, I set still, silent, pale,, and ti-embling--&#xD;
and thought to myself, is this really you, Hal-you that have faced&#xD;
almost every danger from the savage attack of a fice up.. Am I not&#xD;
mistaken? Can this really be the gentleman who so ably defended&#xD;
Pete Smith for stealing a coat, when he himself saw him do it, and&#xD;
unblushingly appealed to and confronged a jury one .half of whom&#xD;
were also witnesses of the flagrant act,? Pinched myself to ascertain&#xD;
whether I was really I, and a 'slight scream to my infinite horror&#xD;
denoted that I had. pinched the lady's rounded- arm, as it lay upon the&#xD;
arm of the chair beside me.&#xD;
Here the entrance of Miss Clara put an end to my series of nervous&#xD;
attacks and I became myself again.&#xD;
I remained until dark, and then Miss Clara going out of the room&#xD;
to order lights,,I said to myself now or never, walked over and taking&#xD;
the lady's hand, burst forth into a'torrent of passionate appeal which&#xD;
grew more and more fervid as I proceeded.&#xD;
You may perhaps imagine its fervidness when I inforpi you that it&#xD;
was of the " Will you hear me.Katy Dar-ar-ling" style and brought&#xD;
tears of unaffected pity from my own eyes.&#xD;
When I finished, I listened in the dark with wide awake ears for&#xD;
my answer and it cane in the well known tones of Miss Clara, who&#xD;
informed me in her clear bell-like voice,-" that another time she&#xD;
would give me an answer,. but now she coIld not.',&#xD;
I did not start, I did not' move, and. av she gently withdrew her&#xD;
hand .from mine, I felt as if falling fom a: balloon-down, down, I&#xD;
came whirling, turning, and: as I struck the egrh the sudden entrance&#xD;
of Miss Estelle with the servantatbearing, lights brought me-to my&#xD;
senses.&#xD;
-*When I again became master of my faculties I was seated at a&#xD;
window gazing at the full round moon, as it rolled seemingly behind&#xD;
cloud after cloud. Miss Clara had left the room and naught but my-&#xD;
self and' Estelle were its occupants.&#xD;
She looked pale and furtively glancing her eyes at me, she met -my&#xD;

the pretfeihded remorse ofthat confounded hypocrite John Gelon was&#xD;
but as "small potatoes " when compared with Inine.&#xD;
Sarose, an4 not daring to look at her, I passed from the house,&#xD;
An  moniting, I rode I knew not whither. What thoughts racked&#xD;
fhy brain that night I can not expresS, sufice it to say naught could&#xD;
change my inflexible purpose of marrying her if her answer was&#xD;
favorable.&#xD;
I was satisfied tb wreck all my hopes of future happiness, rather&#xD;
than humiliate that proud and queenlike girl.&#xD;
. Letting iny horse go where he would, he at length brought up at&#xD;
the hotel, and I entered to suffer ten thousand torments, at being&#xD;
forced to listen to Mac's dilations upon his beautiful prospects of,&#xD;
su'ccesd With Miss Clara.'&#xD;
The next morning I obtained one of those rich obstinate clients,&#xD;
who fill ltwyer's pur8es with their surplus fuads, and then "run down "&#xD;
the profession as being a pack of rascals.. His business and perpetual&#xD;
consultation almost' drove Miss Clara out of my head, and for three&#xD;
or four days I drove the subject from my mind by desperate appliea-&#xD;
tion to business.&#xD;
One evening a little darkey eaie round and told me that Misa&#xD;
Duchhpell6 wished I Would c All around in the evening, and with a&#xD;
muttered eUse upon my ii  furttniate luck I went over to her resi.&#xD;
dence.n&#xD;
After"nany-pros and cons, she informed me that being an intimate&#xD;
friend of Miss Clara she had been requested by that ladyto inform&#xD;
me that not wishing to accept me in popria-persona she had deputed&#xD;
her to perform that delicate mission.&#xD;
I muttered my thanks, and surprised at this mode of doing business,&#xD;
was more so upon being informed that it must be a secret, and that&#xD;
I must not come near the house, but send any messages I wished for&#xD;
her by Miss Duchapella until she came of age which would be in&#xD;
about two months.&#xD;
No excuse was offered for this strange mode of transacting affairs,&#xD;
and I was content not to visit the scene of my unfortunate faux pa.&#xD;
fbr months to come.&#xD;
In the nieantime Hall and Mac kept up a perfect fusilade against&#xD;
each other, and 'both being put in nomination by the two opposite&#xD;
parties for the legislatuife, their rivalry in love and politics was&#xD;
wrought up 'to an exciting pitch.  . .&#xD;

He was a merry, dapper little Frenchman, an4 for shrewdness and&#xD;
capability of taking care of number one, lead, the host of close'chaps,&#xD;
that have gained for Redstick a reputation far and wide of being the&#xD;
sharpest leetle place in the south-west,&#xD;
"By Gar, deese ese de mose go long place I servair place mon pied&#xD;
in," was the exclamation of a Creole gent with immense mustach*es,&#xD;
and a small carpet-bag, as he stamped the floor of the hotel in his&#xD;
impatience to get inrthe dilatory stage and leave for evaire the seenp&#xD;
of his troubles; ''.Les night I save arrivez in zis got bleas place wi&#xD;

With the premise that the gent meant, stqge instead of tpater, wp&#xD;
will go on with our character, hoping thet the reader can from the&#xD;
above sample conjecture what kind of .blades infested Redstick.&#xD;
Coming to Uedstiek without a nt, Toruerre soon found his level,&#xD;
and raise a pile sufficient to commence business upon-lpis own hp/g.&#xD;
His limited knowledge of the language did not prevent his acquiring&#xD;
an intimate knowledge of the "History of the Four Iings," and i&#xD;
,a few weeks Tonnerro was 'flush."&#xD;
One evening as he was loitering aroud the precinctsog he Spread&#xD;
Eagle, with one eye .open to business, his attention was attracted tq&#xD;
the eagerness displayed by a couple off "chock-shirt raftsmen " to get&#xD;
rid of their money, "they didn't care how. they bet, they said, any&#xD;
chdto get, rid.of"their 'surplus' and at the same. time please the&#xD;
children."&#xD;
Walking up to them, Tonnerre was soon an. intimate of the twe&#xD;
gent, who readily acceded to his request to. play a leetle gaM&#xD;

it was time to change the current of the game, lie then set to with all&#xD;
his cunning and in a few moments ie twas loser two hundred and fifty&#xD;
dollars. His sabres' come nrow in qu'ck and earnest succession, and&#xD;
he double-cut, shuffled the cards, and in a quarter of an hour he had&#xD;
the bon sueces# of gazing .his last at five hundred dollars.&#xD;
" Sacre mille Tonnerres !" he exclaimed, as he arose and rapidly&#xD;
run down stairs and borrowed fifty dollars to throw in the current&#xD;
to dam up his streak of ill ltck.&#xD;
It was his deal, and giving himself three aces and a pair of kings,&#xD;
he went forty better, on a bet of five, was called, and completely&#xD;
astoundeud at the sight'of aflusth in the hands of one of the raftsmen.&#xD;
'Jumping to his feet he exclaimned:&#xD;
".By grass, who you be-you dat do dis ."&#xD;
Rising on the .opposite side of the table, the two gents, after&#xD;
pocketing the money, tore open their check-shirts and displayed a&#xD;
splendid suit underneath, and a shirt bosom' literally blazing with&#xD;
diamond studs, and filagree chains. With a low laugh they exclaimed&#xD;
"Soft snap," and before Tonnerre could prevent them away they went&#xD;
down stairs, andthat was the last he ever saw of the raftsnen.&#xD;
If ever you cone to Redstick and meet a little dapper Frenchman,&#xD;
who displays an immense amount of anxiety to minister to your&#xD;
amusentent, just lean over and whisper in his ear "Soft snap," and I&#xD;
assure fou, you will not be again annoyed with the attentions, either&#xD;
direct or indirect, of 'Monsieur Jean Babtiste Belizaire * Bergeron&#xD;
Tonnerre.-&#xD;
In addition to his many other qualifications, Tonnerre was a violent&#xD;
politician and w one of Mac's staunchest supporters ,&#xD;
He often invited Mac andme to come over and dine with him, and&#xD;
afraid of his 'being nettled with our repeated refusals we one day&#xD;
accepted his invitation to. dine with him, and at dinner hour we&#xD;
accompanied Tonnerre to his domicil. Upon our arrival Tonnerre's&#xD;
servant rang an enormous cracked bell, which could be heard almost&#xD;
a mile off, and with every form and ceremony used atthe most formal&#xD;
dinner party, among the aristocracy, we were marshalea to the -table.&#xD;
We had tiever before partaken of French cookery and this our first&#xD;
experience was delightful;. it appeared to me' that rabbits must have&#xD;
been' very cheap in market for almost every dish was composed-of&#xD;
sqme part of that little animal.&#xD;
The "bill of fare," for the little scamp had a regular "bill of fare&#xD;
comme la Nouvelle Orleans," denoted that fried rabbits, stewed rab-&#xD;
bits, rabbit soup, fricasee de lepine and several other "kickshos de&#xD;
lepine," as Mac denominated them,, formed the whole of the first and&#xD;
second courses.&#xD;
Although neither of us had any extraordinary love for rabbit, still&#xD;
as there appeared to be nothing else but lepine, we "pitched *in&#xD;
and eat the heartiest dinner that we had ever partaken of in Redstick.&#xD;
Whei we had finished Tonnerre made an extraordinarily long 'and&#xD;
eloquegit speech, the greater part of which we' neither understood nor&#xD;
appreciated; every now and then he would stop, and twisting his&#xD;

and encored-then, all hands would fill up and take a drink.&#xD;
This amusement lasted until Tonnerre let down,-and then he took&#xD;
an enormous big drink,-after which he began again,-"Vous avez&#xD;

Wee, wee," we shouted.&#xD;
"Very well den, shentillhommes, you ees de fus dat'evaire I see in&#xD;

of indignation such only as a Frenchman can assume.&#xD;
You no believe me, by grass,  avnrieette vien toutsweet; bring do&#xD;

"You infernal scoundrel! "I shouted, as the girl. entered with a&#xD;
bird cage in her hand, within the limits of which two enormous cat&#xD;
quietly reposed; "you miserable French cuss if you have made me&#xD;
eat cats, I'll be hanged if I don't break every bone in your body,"&#xD;
and I would have put my threat into execution if the sight of the&#xD;
heads and skins brought in by the girl had not produced an instinta-&#xD;
neous explosion of my waistcoat buttons and tremendous upheaving&#xD;
of the inward man,&#xD;
I run out of doors and there found Mac, who had waited not for&#xD;
farther proof, holding on to a horse-rack and in the regular succession&#xD;
of the bill of fare vomiting forth rabbit in every shape. I was too&#xD;
eick to pay much attention to him,'and sitting down upon the steps, I&#xD;
soon gazed with astonishment at the enormous quantity I had eaten.&#xD;
That dinner was sufficient for us for a week, for every time I went to&#xD;
put anything into my mouth-visions oflricaseed cat danced before&#xD;
my eyes and I was forced to get up from the table. Mac was in such&#xD;
a woeful plight that the mewingof a cat was sufficient to set him going,&#xD;
and the story getting out came very' near ruining his chances of&#xD;
lection.&#xD;
I never went near Miss Duchapella during the two months of my&#xD;
robation, but on the contrary run into every kind of excess-i the&#xD;
opes that she might repent of her choice and set me again at liberty.&#xD;
Mac and Hall were out electioneering pretty near all the time, and&#xD;
together told more lies, kissed more ugly babies and spent moe&#xD;
money than they usually did during a whole year.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII1.&#xD;
strike for your country--&#xD;
And yourself-"&#xD;
TiHERE was to be a grand barbecue at ' a place called "Seven-up&#xD;
Creek," about twenty niiles from town,.and as Mac and Hall were to&#xD;
be the orators of the day, I and Colonel Wadd accompanied Mac out&#xD;
to the place appointed.&#xD;
The day was very warm, and to make" the matter worse, we were&#xD;
all on horseback, and the road was unshady and dusty as could be.&#xD;
But by means of a bottle of the meanest kind of -whisky, purchased&#xD;
from a wayside inn, we managed to get along tolerably well until we&#xD;
arrived at the bank of a little river which bbre the euphonious title&#xD;
of "Big Devil's lun."1&#xD;
Here'we were stumped, for there was no bridge, and we were igno-&#xD;
yant as to whether the river was low enough to be forded.&#xD;
The waters were muddy and the current swift, and we came to tho&#xD;
conclusion, that "the better part of valor was-discretion," and set&#xD;
down on a little bluff that jutted out into the river, to await the&#xD;
arrival of a party on behind, some of whom Nvele well acquairkted with&#xD;
the "depth of water " thereabouts; and,-at th same time, we spread&#xD;
our lunch composed of cheese, crackers 94dthe afore-mentioned&#xD;
bottle of "rot-gut," and passed the time very pleasantly..&#xD;
Some time having elapsed, and no one appearing, Colonel Wadd&#xD;
came to the conclusion that he would strip off and take a bath in the&#xD;
muddy waters of the "run," and ascertain its depth.&#xD;
Colonel Wadd was very large and of a corpulent tendency, and the&#xD;
first thing he determined on was to take a running jump from the&#xD;
little bluff and dive. Standing back about twenty feet he clapped his&#xD;
hands and started in a run; arriving at the edge, he pitched in head.&#xD;
foremost, and come down ker swallop-in two inches water! He fell&#xD;
on his breast and hands,.and you could have heard him grunt&#xD;
mile off.&#xD;
We waded in and helped him out, and when we found that he was&#xD;
not hurt materially, we made the woods resound with our shouts of&#xD;
laughter. We had all expected (I know not why) that the water was&#xD;
at least ten feet deep under the bluff, when in fact it hardly covered&#xD;
the mud.&#xD;
We mounted after that, and in no place did the stream cover the&#xD;
fetlocks of our horses. Arrived on the other side W dismounted&#xD;
and threw water over our horses with a tin-cup until they were drip6&#xD;
ping wet; this wasto cool them down, for the heat haditold terribly&#xD;
on them that day.&#xD;
We had just finished and were replacing our saddles, when Hall&#xD;
made his appearance on the opposite bank.  .&#xD;
"Boys," said the Colonel, "Hall is as ignorant of the depth of the&#xD;
water as we were; if he halloos to us, don't you answer back, an&#xD;
we'll see some fun."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Hall, however, did not!ask ugr any questions; but judging from&#xD;
appearances thatwe had swam  the "' run," he dismounted, and taking&#xD;
off his.olothes,;carefully tied them in t bundle, which he as Carefully:&#xD;
tied upon the top of his head; and then morinting, his 'horse, he drew&#xD;
up his legs and carefully, with drawn rein, proceeded to feel his way&#xD;
agregs.&#xD;
When he had.got about half way across, and the water as yet not&#xD;
reaching the horse's fetlocks, we could holding no longer, but broke,&#xD;
forth into roars at his comic appearance. There he was, still- in the&#xD;
expectatkninthat the streatawould suddenly deepen and himself and'&#xD;
horse be precipitated head over heels itito the water;:when, to crown&#xD;
ajl, a large body of electors, on their wAy to'the barbecue,: ppeared'&#xD;
upon the opposite 'bank.&#xD;
Their uproarioua laughter, arid- the presence of two ladies-,in a&#xD;
buggy among the crowd,-awoke Hallito a sense of, the ridiculous posi-'&#xD;
tion he was placed in; who coming down suddenly upon his horse:&#xD;
with a long peach wand he had been feeling his way with, the animal&#xD;
jumped from. under him, and Hal, clothes and all came down ker.'&#xD;
81lng into theaterr' The whoops and shouts of the crowd on the&#xD;
other bank and out own laughter, wereenough to awake the dead, and&#xD;
Hall, grabbing his bundle, sped on after his horse like a streak, of&#xD;
lightning. .how and where he caught him, we could not find out,'for&#xD;
when weiarrived at the barbecue-ground, the gentlemati denied ever&#xD;
coming that road at all, and accounted for the dampness of his clothes&#xD;
by remarking that he'd "sweat so much that he had to stop and wring&#xD;
the perspiration out of his apparel"&#xD;
The grounds were densely thronged with-the male and female res-&#xD;
idents of the neighborhood, and we spent a merry hour  in walking&#xD;
around, making acquaintances,.shaking hands and cracking jokes be-&#xD;
fore the proceedings of the day began.&#xD;
At length the biggest, fattest, ugliest man in the crowd arose and&#xD;
moved, in a sharp, crackeAI voice, that Colonel Snorter be called to the&#xD;
chair, and then named some twenty majors, colonels, and judges as-&#xD;
vice. presidents afid moderators. No one expressing opposition to&#xD;
the gentleman's moves, the little platform was soon crowded with the-.&#xD;
patriotier officers of the day,-&#xD;
, Colqual.Snorter made a glowing and elegant. speech about the fu.-.&#xD;
ture destinies of our kentry, and the safety of the interests of. thed'&#xD;
South depending upon the coning election, and set down exhausted&#xD;
amid the enthusiastic cheers of three little niggers up in an adjacent&#xD;
thorn-tree.&#xD;
Hall was then called for, who appeared with a "wheelbarrow" load!&#xD;
of books, to which he intended referring in support of his assertions..&#xD;
The weight of the books, in addition to the humanities already upon&#xD;
the platform, came pretty near breaking down that frail creation of a&#xD;
country carpenter. But Hall manfully disregarded the cracking of&#xD;
the planks and proceeded, in a two hours' speech, to convince the-&#xD;

"Swni 'Devil's Run in two' inches water," responded some indi-&#xD;
vidual in the cr6wd'&#xD;
Hereupon the crowd coinmenced laughing, and every time they&#xD;
ceased, Iall would make some assertion' in 'his most fiery manner,&#xD;
whereupon a drunken chip, who was reclining against the foot of an&#xD;
o1( pine nearly opposite to him, would' sing out -through his nose is&#xD;
imitation of the deep bass tones of an old bull frog, " Very deep!&#xD;
very deep!"' and another red-headed chap directly under the plat-&#xD;
frin would respond in the clear shrill pipe of the green tree-toad,&#xD;
"Knee dip ! knee deep !" This continued until he finished speaking.&#xD;
,,Macthen got up and commenced an eloquent strain  about the&#xD;
Mexican war, which was interrupted! by the crowd taking refuge un-&#xD;
derneath the platform, hoping thereby to get out of the rain which&#xD;
hkd commenced pouring down; but the contracted' space was sooh&#xD;
full, and then they commenced fighting each other, and in a few mo-&#xD;
meats overturned the platform with all the presidents and "vices" on&#xD;
top of' it. They went flying in all directions. Mic pitched head-&#xD;
foremost into .a basket of eggs which was lying at the foot of a trqe&#xD;
near by, and, Colonel Snorter was suspended from one of the posts,&#xD;
by his coat tail for ten or fifteen minutes before the quarreling and&#xD;
fighting crowd could hear his loud yells for help.&#xD;
The rain did not break up the barbecue until everything oa the&#xD;
ground was eaten up by the crowd; which being accomplished, we all&#xD;
set out for home, the rain in the meantime coming down upon our&#xD;
devoted heads in torrents.&#xD;
-Wheni we' gt to the " Big Devil's Run," we were going at a gallop,&#xD;
and without drawing rein, we dashed into the water; and before we&#xD;
were twenty feet from the bank, Colonel Wadd and I were washed&#xD;
from our saddles, and Mac and 'Hall were swimming their horses for&#xD;
dear life.-&#xD;
'The confounded creek had risen about ten feet from the' rain, and&#xD;
we had hard work to get ashore.&#xD;
When we arrived home that night the resolve was mutual that, to&#xD;
no more barbecues would we 'go if they took place on the other side&#xD;
of "Big Devil's Run."&#xD;
-t&#xD;
&#xD;
"Here'~Ao the victory that was lost and won."&#xD;
ELECTION-DAY cane at last, and each party flocked to the polls, in&#xD;
the full and expressed consciousices that to them belonged the victory&#xD;
and the spoils.&#xD;
All day long the fighting, drinking and quarreling about the court&#xD;
house and Spread Eagle was uproari6ds.&#xD;
' Mac had three voters penned up'in the loft of our office, in a happ.&#xD;
itate -of unconsciousness as to whether they were in heaven, or d .&#xD;
eath , He intended to poll their votes just before the polls closed 4&#xD;
'but, uifotunately, whilst he was busily engaged in stealing one ot&#xD;
Hill's from underneath an"' empty rice hogslhead behind the' court.!&#xD;
house, some of that'gentleman's emissaries succeeded in letting therd.&#xD;
down by a'ropbtied around their middle from the loft window, and&#xD;
running them out to a county precinct voted them for Hull.&#xD;
At 140t the' polb were closed, and the votes counted, when it was&#xD;
ascertained that Hall led Mac ten votes at the town' precinct; and&#xD;
that, somehow or other, the county precincts, not satisfied with either&#xD;
had' voted for Colonel Peter Wadd, and that gentleman at twelVe&#xD;
o'clock was just even.with them-and Pumpkin Hollow to hear front.&#xD;
We were all assembled at the hotel 'eoop and were in a-high state&#xD;
of anxiety to hear from the denizens of' -Pumpkin Hollow. 'Hail&#xD;
claimed it, and Mac swore he'd carried' it, and the Colonel's friends&#xD;
swore"'he'd carried it, and there it was 'nip and 'tuck, who 'could brag&#xD;
the most about the expected returns from' Pumpkin Hollow.&#xD;
Hour after hour we impatiently awaited the dilatory arrival of the&#xD;
bearer of dispatches from Pumpkin Honow, and at twelve o'clock he&#xD;
lhad not yet made his appearaidie.  ''t"&#xD;
At this hour the ,greater pqrtion ofthe crowd were inside tho&#xD;
4ensely packed bar-room, engaged in drinking, shouting and quarrel-&#xD;
iMg. What feW remained iri'the street hvere mostly those who ad&#xD;
bet heavily on the result, and were stading silently stirring into the&#xD;
pitchy darkness, every now and then fanbying that they dould shear&#xD;
the letteringg 'hoofs of the 'returning o i6er s horse as he enteied&#xD;
the town. At length, the joyous cry of, "There he cokmei!"ta;cofni-&#xD;
panied by the pit-a-pat of the horse s hoofs, brought us out of doors&#xD;
in a perfect jam. , One fellow got,his foot entangled 'at the doorLway,&#xD;
and allihands caime tumbling down, helter-skelter.&#xD;
As they arose every one seemed to be labrying under the impress&#xD;

Here a difficulty arose-about appointing judges, some of UI hl's&#xD;
friends wanting a majority of that gentleman's friends to be on the&#xD;

At length, Mac. was a1wed to choose six and Hall six, which they&#xD;
did, and the judges mounted with alacrity an old sloping shed, that&#xD;
was nearly a mile, as well as could be ascertained, from the spot where&#xD;

that those who did not make almost as quick time as the horses,&#xD;
stopped on the road to have the matter out among themselves. .&#xD;
The disturbance ceased, and then atose the question as to whioh&#xD;
horse had won the race, none of the judges were able to say anything&#xD;
about the matter, and some of them were in a more fit statfor a hos-&#xD;
pital than to decide the momentous question then at issue,&#xD;
The riders were appealed to, but each one swore that the hose they 'r&#xD;
respectively rode had come out ahead, and they, at the: same time&#xD;
swore just as decidedly that each other was the biggest liar unhuig,&#xD;
and so-and so tle race had to be run over again.&#xD;
Again the judges were chosen and the crowd resumed their position&#xD;
at the starting point, save a few who, distrustful of the judges, occupied&#xD;
a position opposite the stand.&#xD;
The horses were drawn up together, and the judges were about to&#xD;
give the word, when the whole crowd were thrown, into confusion by&#xD;
tie charge of a furious hull that hadbroken out of a ,neighboring&#xD;
field, in order to 'be present and .take a hand, or rather horn, in the&#xD;
matter.&#xD;
His onslaught *s so furious gnd sudden, that two or three of the&#xD;
outsiders went whirling in the ait before they were aware of his pres-&#xD;
ence. Some who were protected by their position on the inside of&#xD;
the throng, shouted: '&#xD;
"Go on with the race'; never mind the dirn bull."' But Mr. B4l&#xD;
soon made them aware of the -fact that if the crowd was large 'he&#xD;
would put them all to flight.&#xD;
Two or three desperate lunges soon convinced the crowd that the&#xD;
diekens was to- pay, and they commenced scattering in all directions.&#xD;
There was a small flat-roofed house upon which ,the starting judges&#xD;
sat near the road, and the top was soonas thick as the top of a bee-&#xD;
hive of a hot summer's day.&#xD;
The buggies were crammtred in an instant, and as there were a great&#xD;
many on the ground, not more than twenty"persons were 'lft without&#xD;
ptotoction. jfThese individuals went kiting in everg direction-wothe&#xD;
bull first pursuing one and then another.&#xD;
Some eight or ten having taken refuge behind the judge's stand,&#xD;
were pursued by the bull who ran them round and round the house&#xD;
four or five times. He was rapidly gaining on them when he suddenly&#xD;
faced about and stopped stock still.&#xD;
The pursued still thinking that he was following them, and in hot&#xD;
haste to escape, came tearing and shrieking around the corner of the&#xD;
stand, and their sudden dismay upon pitching right upon the horns&#xD;
of the bull affles description.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
"My name is Norv1--&#xD;
From the Grampian hills I come."&#xD;
THE contest between Hall and Wadd came off some thirty days&#xD;
after the horse race, and Wadd beat Hall like all forty. Maef friends&#xD;
having voted for the former gentleman though spite against Hall,&#xD;
engendered by the many fights and quarrels -incident upon the races,&#xD;
and former election.&#xD;
Redstick had subsidediromJ the high stite of excitement, in which&#xD;
its population had boiled and Jubbled for the past three months, and&#xD;
everything, including everybody, was as moody as a young lawyer on&#xD;
being snubbed bf the presiding judge.&#xD;
Something was wanting, and a lyceum was proposed as a fit reme-&#xD;
dy for the evil; but after enjoying a sickly existence it "let down,"&#xD;
and a jury of six slightly tostieated young gents, found a verdict of&#xD;
"too much sass among, the -youngsters, and want of appreciation&#xD;
among the fair sex of Redstick."&#xD;
Some happy genius proposed the inauguration of an "Amateur&#xD;
Thespian Society," and the proposal meeting with the warmest ap-&#xD;
proval, all the, young 'hen in the place becanie members, and the&#xD;
preparations for the "grand opening" were prophetic of a success-&#xD;
ful and happy hit. Nothing could be heard of in the place but the&#xD;
" coming event," which instead of casting any shadow before, threw&#xD;
out the brightest gassy glare before its gay and looming figure, that&#xD;
made the shadow behindd," which came sure enough, thrice more&#xD;
dark and gloomy.&#xD;
To, cr'wn all, a play was written by Hall for the "opening," which&#xD;
for verbosity, oddity and happy combination of tragedy, comedy,&#xD;
farce and dramatic .theology, beat the bangers and took "several&#xD;
feet of recumbent linen from the bosom'of the dwarfed monarch of&#xD;
the pea-field."&#xD;
The subject filled the miridg of all, and even the girls were as full&#xD;
of the spirit of the thing as any of us; one of them upon being&#xD;
asked by Chickadiddy, -the clerk .in the dry-goods -store, to..what&#xD;
address must he send a half yard of tape she had just purchased,&#xD;
exclaimed :&#xD;
"My name 'is Norval -on the Grampian-.Oh ! deary me, I forgot-&#xD;
just send it up to Mr. Tootsweet's, and pa says charge it until the first&#xD;
of January.".&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am,".answered Chickadiddy, who was to act. as King&#xD;
Casimr in the coming play. "Charge! charge! my heroes ! On&#xD;
'ye braves who'd rather diethan be-a-a-a-tigger.'&#xD;
The opening night came. at last, and the substitute f e1C4 Hall&#xD;

unoccupied house, was filled to its utmost capacity, by the old and&#xD;
young of both sexes.&#xD;
The upper end wa.icreened off from: observation, by fifteen table-&#xD;
cloths sewed together and made to hoist away to the ceiling by means&#xD;
of pulleys.  In front of this excuse for scenery was a row of tallow&#xD;
candles stuck in tin sconces, throwing a' lurid light upon nowhere in&#xD;
particular. The lower portion was occupied with benches that 'rose&#xD;
gradually from the floor to the'ceiling, and these were crammed to-&#xD;
their utmost capacity. The audience was so large that the floor was&#xD;
occupied witl gentlemen standing. crowded up to within ten feet of&#xD;
the footlights. Our orchestra was composed of a black fiddler, a&#xD;
white genius who played very wdl on the bass drum,.and a fellow&#xD;
who screamed away on a fife. What was lacking in harmony they&#xD;
made up in noise.. Theywere perched up on. the top of a plat-&#xD;
form, resting upon the heads of four or five whisky barrels, placed&#xD;
on end, and did great service :in drowning the uproar of the&#xD;
audience.&#xD;
At last their noisy demonstrations of impatience were silenced by&#xD;
the loud clanging of a cow-bell, and the table-cloths began slowly to&#xD;
ascend to the ceiling, revealing to the audience another demi-screeri,&#xD;
composed of an old carpet, which hung suspended from the walls by&#xD;
two ropes ; in the hurry to draw up thecurtain, which operation taxed&#xD;
the strength of six men, who ntade, known the demands upon their&#xD;
strength by noisy grunts, they clogged the pulleys and it would not&#xD;
fall and cover the retreat of Cassimir's men in the sixth act; but,&#xD;
however, that mattered not, as they tan under the carpet, which was&#xD;
supposed to represent the forest of "Inglemere."&#xD;
The first actor called upon was a, little fellow by the name of Sam&#xD;
Chike, who represented the despairing lover in the piece. Short and&#xD;
chubby, with a .countenance beaming with joyous health and the con-&#xD;
tents .of a small flask, he kept concealed in his, large red sash, (formed&#xD;
from one of the red curtains of the "'Spread Eagle.") He neverthe-&#xD;
less acted the part of the, "despairing lover " to perfection. With&#xD;
his head cast down, he "shut himself up like a jack-knife " in&#xD;
response to the enthusiastic applause of the audience, and commenced&#xD;
his "'appeal to the gods " in so low a tone that noone could hear him.&#xD;
"Louder! louder!" exclaimaed~te audience; and "iDown in front,"&#xD;
succeeded in drowning his low appeal, which he succeeded in at last&#xD;
elevating to a kind of "melo-dramatic" squeal.&#xD;
" Down in front !" continued the back-seaters, which met with no&#xD;
response from the gentlemen infront, save a smiling glance at the&#xD;
floor, which was covered with spittle and tobacco quids, promiscuously&#xD;
inteimingled, an inch in depth, until a cry was raised that the ladies&#xD;
could not see ; and then, if you have ever seen a covey of patiidges&#xD;
squat in a rice field, you can form some, Saint s idea of the manner in&#xD;
which the front rank sank to the dirty, slippery floor. Men of Red-&#xD;

-squat, upon that nasty floor, equaled in heroism and self-disregard,&#xD;
the triumphant assault of the French upon the Malakoff.&#xD;
Chike was -impelled, by all this cry and struggle to get a look at&#xD;
'him, 'to exert himself, and raise his voice to-a loud, frantic demi-setni-&#xD;
quaver, but' unfortunately, at this moment, he forgot his part, and&#xD;
stood with uplifted arm a prey to emotions too various to Mention.&#xD;
For a moment there was a dead silence, but some one thinking that&#xD;
he was waiting for the noise to cease, commenced shouting silence, in&#xD;
a loud tone, which caused others to, shout ,silence, and' by the time&#xD;
they ceased the squad in front, who became aware of the cause of his&#xD;
silence, commenced laughing, and 'the merriment soon broke out all&#xD;
over the house.&#xD;
Silence was at length restored, and Chike having backed up against&#xD;
the carpet, in which the prompter'had torn a hole, commenced in a&#xD;
sheepish8tone to repeat from the prompter's lipA, his ".lamentations,"&#xD;
for he had totally forgotten his part, and thenceforth relied upon the&#xD;
prompter'to put him through.&#xD;
"Ye woods and dingled dells," whispered the prompter.,&#xD;
"Ye goods and dingy wells," repeated Chike;, and so on, until he&#xD;
was completely dead to the audience, and alive-only to-the prompter.&#xD;
'At last; as he repeated in a sheepish voice the words he should have -&#xD;
shouted out, and accompanied with violent gestures, ' Iearme, oh,&#xD;
hear me, Victoria," some one, in trying to peep at the audience&#xD;
through the prompter's hole in the carpet, trod heavily on that gentle-&#xD;
man's foot, upon which he angrily exclaimed:&#xD;
"4Get off my foot, you dirn fool."&#xD;
Chike, who was listening eagerly frihis promptings, and aroused&#xD;
again by the evident dissatisfaction of the audience, shouted:&#xD;
"1Get off my foot you dirn fool!" and if he didn't bring down the&#xD;
house, a la Kean, you Can take, eeiy tile ii Redspick.&#xD;
Although not half through his part, lie retired in a hurry and could&#xD;
not be induced to return again. The next one called was a tall fellow&#xD;
named George Pie, and we expected wonders from him, for more&#xD;

which diet the elephant usually lived, and upon which were seated&#xD;
three.fiddlers, two Dutch brass trumpeters, (I mean tw6 brass Dutch&#xD;
trumpeters,) and a little bit-of fellow behind an enormous bass drum,&#xD;
making more noise .-than any of them; their atrival, as aforesaid,&#xD;
threw the town into a perfect uproar. Everybody who could raise a&#xD;
quarter was inside the tent that night to see the Curiosities.- Great.&#xD;
was the wonder excited by the wonderful performances of the elephant,&#xD;
and his eating two barrels of apples without winking his eyes, or pay-&#xD;
iig. for them, drew expressions of wonder from staid people who had.&#xD;
'never wondered before.&#xD;
The Misses Smythe were there, and though I was! debarred, by my.&#xD;
promise, from keeping their company, still I followed them, as accomb&#xD;
panied by Hall they slowly went the rounds of. the nine cages of&#xD;
monkeys, paroquets and the wonderful elephant.&#xD;
When they arrived, at this animal's station, Hall purchased some&#xD;
apples, and proceeded to show the ladies how dexterously the animal&#xD;
could take them out of his hind coat-tail pockets, which, he did with&#xD;
such alacrity that lie had them down his immense throat before you&#xD;
doulJl say peas. WhetherHall wished to. fool their elephant, or didnot&#xD;
wish to purchase more apples, I can not tell, but he kept on'tufninl&#xD;
his swallow tails to him, and motioning for. him, to;take thefancied&#xD;
apple, until the huge beast tired .of searching his empty pockets, with&#xD;
his snout, dexterously pushed that article up Hall's back, audripping&#xD;
his coat from top to bottom, sucked his shirt dut'about a feet. - The&#xD;
keeper observing his playfulness struck him gently across the snout&#xD;
with an iron bar, and relieved, Hall from his interesting situation;&#xD;
upon which that gentleman,.without waiting to tuck in his unmena&#xD;
tionables, put in hot haste for the door, leaving the ladies to the tender&#xD;
mercies of Dick Foxy and me who both being under bang took&#xD;
advantage of the opportunity to reinstate ourselves.&#xD;
Dick being first, took Misa.Clara, and Ito my great joy Miss Estolle&#xD;
had no objection to allowing me: to show her the hyenas and other'&#xD;
etcetera .&#xD;
I had no opportunity te set myself right upon the itnportait ques.&#xD;
tion that then -kept my heart..topsy-turvey, and the carriage at'the&#xD;

it was known that the savage animal was at large, untrammeled, and&#xD;
wrought up to his highest pitch of fury by the sight of blood.&#xD;
-Women and children ran screaming with terror up and down the&#xD;
street, and the male population ran wildly to and fro, loading revolvers,&#xD;
rifdes,.shot-guns; and every species of firearm in the place. Ever.Ty&#xD;
now and then the sharp crack of. a rifle denoting that some one had&#xD;
discharged at old load,:would draw a shriller-scream from the i inen,.&#xD;
who thought sure'that'-the elephant was upon them. All that day&#xD;
scoutsgon foot and on horseback came and went from the scene of the&#xD;
revolt, and they reported that he confined himself to a neck of woods&#xD;
some four miles in extent; and distant from any habitation, he was'&#xD;
amusing himself by tearing up small trees and screeching like forty&#xD;
steamboat whistles united i one.'&#xD;
The next morning, at an early hour, small parties began to leave&#xD;
town, to participate in the grand hunt after the elephant.'&#xD;
In company with a German friend of mine, I armed and equipped&#xD;
as the law directs, that is, provided with a rifle, loaded with slugs, a1nd'&#xD;
a'small pocket pistol, cocked 'and primed, with eaudevie; off we put,-&#xD;
I on foot and he on horseback; for such 'was' the universal request&#xD;
horses were in, that I could not procure one for love or money, I&#xD;
had, hoWever, as the day was warm,' procured an enormous cotton&#xD;
umbrella, *hich, as my friend Snicks' was peculiarly susceptible to&#xD;
heat, was a constant source of annoyance to him.&#xD;
.I 4 If' it has not bin I don't want to go backs to town, cauze I'm&#xD;

what for he shine hot like blaze to-dey? Dis is shust de way all de&#xD;
time when I have got not de umberel,' it is hot shust as fire, by dam-"&#xD;
And he went on recounting to me the many elephant hunts in which&#xD;
he had participated, when in India, and advising me what to do if I&#xD;
was hot pressed by the animal. "E'f he pus you close shust get up&#xD;
soelittle tree you no can find; you no he pulls up de big tree, but de&#xD;
little one he no can wind his nose around."&#xD;
"All right, old horse, take care of yourself, Ill be bound he don't&#xD;
get me," I exclaimed.&#xD;
"" Takes care of self! Got for dam, I have killed ten of dese big&#xD;
bugs in one day.   f you know how you can manages him it is not&#xD;

: HePb he proposed a swap with me, I to take his horse, and he to&#xD;
take ray umbrella. As we were very close to where report had accred'&#xD;

and was fixing my feet' in the stirrups, when a yell from Snicks ap-&#xD;
prised me 'that we'were in danger. Quick Fas thought I reined 1p,&#xD;
and discovered the elephant breaking for us- though a small lung&#xD;

clattering down the road, "let me on behind."&#xD;
"Save yourself," I shouted, as I pummeled the pony with heels&#xD;
ind fists; no time to swap horses now; and it wasn't just about then,&#xD;
for a more ferocious looking beast I never saw. Snicks was hot&#xD;
pressed; he attempted to clinib several trees, but gave up the idea so&#xD;
often, that the elephant came very near getting him; at last he&#xD;
crawled under a hollow log, which the elephant ran over two or th-ee&#xD;
fimes in looking for him, and his immenspweight nearly crushed poor&#xD;
Snicks.&#xD;
"As for me, on I went like a streak of mighty slow lightning, aX&#xD;
just as I began to draw rein, I looked around, and there he came&#xD;
booming up the road, his snout raised high in the air, his red mouth&#xD;
wide open screeching like blazes; you could have heard his ears flap.&#xD;
ping against his thick hide a mile off.&#xD;
He was gaining upon me fast, when I came upon the advance&#xD;
guard of the Redstickers, who had marched out in battle array to&#xD;
kill him. Jenimima! what a scattering took place when I came down&#xD;
upon them shouting, "The elephant! the elephant! Look out! look&#xD;
out !" Although scared almost into fits myself, I had to laugh at the&#xD;
scampering and yelling that took place. One fellow on a big black&#xD;
horse rode over two or three on ponies, and the way they dismounted&#xD;
and climbed the roadside trees, would have shamed the very monkeys&#xD;
themselves.  A  Frenchman who wis loaded down with loaded&#xD;
muskets ran'into the cane and brush that lined the road, and when he&#xD;
was discovered next morning fifteen miles from the place where he&#xD;
disappeared, not a soul in the place could recognize his scratched and&#xD;
bunged up face.&#xD;
At every turn of the road we would come upon parties of five or&#xD;
ten onfoot, and on horseback, riding along boasting and bragging of&#xD;
their individual prowess, and in happy unconsciousness of danger&#xD;
when we would come tearing, spurring and yelling down upon them&#xD;
like a young tornado. The change, that would then come over the&#xD;
spirit of their dream would be most stgrtling;- throwing down their&#xD;
guns, those on foot hid in the hollows, or climbed trees, and those on&#xD;
horseback would block up the road, in their operate efforts to all&#xD;
turn at once, and some of them would go down, horse and rider, be-_&#xD;
fore our furious charge. It was curious to see the pitiful expression&#xD;
on some badly-mounted fellow's countenance, as one after another of his&#xD;
better-mounted companions would go tearing by him; he would look&#xD;
around at the enemy as he came down the road in hot pursuit, throw-&#xD;
inr aside, or tossing into the air, the saddles, guns, coats and urm-&#xD;
brellas with*which the road was sprinkled, every now and then stop-&#xD;
ging and ccking his red eye at some; fellow up a tree, give a squeal&#xD;
and then proved to attempt, by winding his trunk around the tree,&#xD;
toohake him down.&#xD;

&#xD;
Baptiste, etc., Tonnerre, who, bestriding a.sorry rmule, wasusing all the&#xD;
variations of the universal acre, in cqnnvotion with, a small limb of a&#xD;
tree, which he. brought down on the mule's quarters with a bang,. in&#xD;
order to make him cross a small alough and, proceed in the direction&#xD;
of the elephant, of whose approach Tonnerre was up to, this moment&#xD;
unconsciouss. The mule was,;standing with, his 'feet all placed deter-&#xD;
minately forward, his ears down and Tonnerre-pounding away like fury.,&#xD;
"By grass, I nevaire see sich hoss;fby. gar, nevaire.-nevaire. I&#xD;

"Turn your mule around,," we shouted, which he hastily did but&#xD;
the mule only turned, and that was all; he proceeded to kick up, and&#xD;
just as I was passing on my jaded horse he run sideways against me&#xD;
and down we came together., The elephant was close upon us, and&#xD;
rising I broke for a couple of trees that stood about ten paces off the&#xD;
road, preceded, however, by Tonnerre whose fears lent wings to his&#xD;
heels; throwing his arms around a tree, he yelled, " Clime de tree for&#xD;
me, Oh mon Dieu!, de tree est no clime me. Sacre! I am Jini, by&#xD;
grass, my wifet and, leetle cheeldren'is all vidders now.", Perceiving&#xD;
that he could not climb I helped him up and then with difficulty climbed&#xD;
the next tree, the bark of which was so smooth that I slipped two or&#xD;
three times before I succeeded in getting up.&#xD;
The elephant was engaged in tossing Tonnerre's red coat high ia&#xD;
the air, and catching it with his tusks, upon perceiving which Ton&#xD;
nerre commenced yelling to me:&#xD;
" Mon Dieu! I have one hongler dollar and a gole vatch in my new&#xD;
coat zat dat dam bis est zamine vit his toot picks. Vous hear me,&#xD;
Monsieur, I Val geeve you fife dollar eef you go run him away so I&#xD;
cin gettee mon vatch."&#xD;
"Hush up you villain," I exclaimed, for our trees were none of the&#xD;
largest, and his confounded clatter attracted the animal's attention.&#xD;
Butthe elephant seemed content with the coat and did not bother us&#xD;
for the-moment,&#xD;
I climbed higher up the tree to get a view of the flying crowd, which&#xD;
Toninerre pereeying, he commenced yelling to me again:&#xD;
"You no; fair, by dam, de bulefant est trapped me fus; come down&#xD;
ze same as I am, eef you be a jentilhomme." But paying no attention&#xD;
to hij, I climbed.still higher, and44e, trying to emulate me, came pretty&#xD;
nigh tumbling out and breaking his' confounded neck, From - up&#xD;
vhere I could get a good view of the roadr the scene, was curious.,&#xD;

scene of the elephantine war.,, The scrambling, turning and whipping&#xD;
of horses would then he terrifies Those that were dismounted wouli&#xD;
takb to the nearest tree, and the-balance would scamper on; At one&#xD;
plack 'here two wagons were hitched, and occupied nearly; the whole&#xD;
of the road, the confusion was indescribable; some jumped the fence,&#xD;

ngger babies, and then ldaped his. horse: to the ground on the other&#xD;

iMy attention.was' soon 'called to matters nearer home; Owing to&#xD;
Tonneire's continued fuss about his coat, the attention of the elephant&#xD;
was attracted to us, and he came tearing at the treesin the tops, of&#xD;
which we were located.&#xD;
Tonnerre's actions and fears were indescribable. Clutching the&#xD;
tree with legs and arms he frantically essayed to climb up higher, but&#xD;
in vain; he was howeviei oufof the elephant's reach, and that animal&#xD;
did not attempt to bring him down in that manner, but winding his&#xD;
trunk around the fee, he plleduQ d  ugged in vain; in the mean&#xD;
time Tonnerre was in an agony of fear; every shake of the tree would&#xD;
be recorded with, a corresiending yell ad elevation ot his hair, until&#xD;
it stuck straight out like the ' neck feathers " of a cowed dunghilll."&#xD;
:"Mqn-Dieu! am I to be manger in dees mis-ra-ble mannaire*+wliat&#xD;

But I uttered iot a'word, the close 'proximity of the fearful. beat&#xD;

Thel party wascomposed of about twenty of both sexes, arid we&#xD;
soon had the tables hopping all over the room. 'Any question that&#xD;
was asked was immediately and accurately answered, by alphabetical&#xD;
knocks, 'and there was hardly one who did' not leave fully convinced&#xD;
'that Old Colonel D.'s spirits were the real genuine quality.&#xD;
"Ofwhat a'e is' Mr. Hall?" was asked; and we were surprised at&#xD;
the spirits answering "Twenty-one ydis, six months, two weeks, one&#xD;
-day, three hours, and fortyiseven minutes."&#xD;
",Oh, Mr., Hall, is that correct?"&#xD;
"Yes, ladies and I assure you that-no one knew my age but myself,.&#xD;
and if he had only mentioned the seconds, I would have believed in&#xD;
spirit all my days.,&#xD;
Here a toery diffieult-,question w"  asked by the old maid"of the&#xD;

she was married or nodt,,she, *ould place infinite reliance upon them.&#xD;

through my own part of the ceremony, and when Mr. Clute was&#xD;

I was before in my life.&#xD;
"Will you have ?" etc., he asked, and just las I was abbut to sy I&#xD;

her at her father's house.,  -&#xD;
Clara's promise was' to blind' her father, who objected to  ac;&#xD;

h9ghtPof leaving the countrY'litted' through my brain; but I had&#xD;
too good a practice t ,leave kad besides 'knew the -laugh wold&#xD;

gathering up all the, loose cards of Mao's and mine, I wrote down' in&#xD;

like.yery well to get, but couldn't.: Shuffling them upip.a hat, and'&#xD;

a deep fi of musing, as to, withroha lived, n town or the country,&#xD;
the color of her eyes, whether she was of the rich or poor Class of&#xD;
cards, which together went into thb hat of fate, etc., etc.&#xD;
At last, I mustered courage and mechanically turned the card over,&#xD;
keeping my eyes fixed in the meantime upon the ceiling. After a few&#xD;
minutes more of musing I brought them down by an effort to the&#xD;
card and started back horror-struck-for, oh, cruel fate, it was blank!&#xD;
(JusSing my neglect in not marking all the cards, I carefully took&#xD;
out the remaining blank strips, and then repeated the experiment,&#xD;
this time in a hurry, for the day was.drawing near a close, and I Nas&#xD;
determined to pop the question that night.&#xD;
&#xD;
SCENES IN THE SOUTH.&#xD;
Drawing out  the card, I was gratified on reading the name of Lucy&#xD;
Duchapelle  Whoop! if she would only have inei thought I; but then&#xD;
there was'no h8pe in that' quarter,,and I sank'back, dejected in the&#xD;
deep old easy chair. Try it, Hal, whispered my good or evil  eniu,&#xD;
I didn'tthen-know which, Maybe she will-but then the flood ofcon-&#xD;
tradictory evidence that flooded my only basis of hope-i-try.&#xD;
Well, heregoes it, and I swear, if again disabpointed, I leave this&#xD;
neck of the woods, and, that too in haste.&#xD;
Di easing 'myself with the utmost care, Y sat through the evening,&#xD;
until it was.time to go overhand 'see the'lady of my choice; thinking,&#xD;
turning and, twisting my cranium, or rather its contentsin-every way,&#xD;
in order to scare up sombmode of procedure, but in vain, I was&#xD;
forded to set tout without any well-digested plan, trusting alone to&#xD;
that chance that heretofore had got me into so many difficulties and&#xD;
then, outt of them.&#xD;
I started out, and+ upon arriving:at' her residence was gratified at&#xD;
finding her at home and alone. All the emotions which rendered me&#xD;
so incapable of action, upon the occasion of my firstvisit, with the&#xD;
same object ir view, in company with many others-engendered by&#xD;
the knowledge that I here was about to make an attempt not influenced&#xD;
by the encouragement I had received from the'-other 'party, came over&#xD;
my benumbed senses, and it :was eleven' o'clock before I recovered&#xD;
myself sufficiently to understand upon what subject'we vere talking,&#xD;
"She is lovely, I thought, as she quietly sat in the deep parlor&#xD;
'rocking-chair, unconscious of the many whirling thoughts ohasing each&#xD;
other through my, brain. .'Hei calm, dark 'eye was bent'upon the floor,&#xD;
as she sat thinking whatnext to say to engage me in conversation,&#xD;
for I was unable to keep up 'any topic she broached. Her deep jet-&#xD;
black curls lay in a mass upon either side of the beautiful face they&#xD;
80 gracefully shaded,. and I-I; grown desperate at the fix I was ii-&#xD;
almost wished -she: had not been so very beautiful, that:my chances&#xD;
had been better.&#xD;
Hal, this will never do, thought I; and wrought u to the highest&#xD;
pitch, I almost shouted:&#xD;
"Miss Lucy !" (Startled, she turned her eyes full upon me, and it&#xD;
was done), "did-didity did-you go-go to church last Sunday ?"&#xD;
"Why, yes," she replied; "didn't yo'u accompany me&#xD;
"Oh! ye-yes; but--I-;.-forgotV'&#xD;
Here we again relapsed irito a speice which was broken by the&#xD;
mantel-clock striking twelve. Now or never; courage, Hal.&#xD;
"Miss Lucy."&#xD;
"Well,V she exclaimed, as I thought, in a semi-petulant tone, which&#xD;
again threw me "hors de combat."&#xD;
"Wer- -well-'tis time for me to leave."&#xD;
I suppose she thought it was time too, but she said nothing. As I&#xD;
got to the door, hat in hand, I stopped and looked down upon the&#xD;
floor. To go home without the satisfaction even of a refusal, would&#xD;

be to suffer the torments again Which had' alicted me all that day,%&#xD;
and I determined, as I could not muster courage enough to pop the&#xD;
question, to bid her farewell atleast, for I was determined to leave&#xD;
Redstick on the morrow.&#xD;
" Miss Lucy," I exclaimed, "I have, I know, acted inexcusably to-&#xD;
night, but the fact is I am going away to-morrow, and the thought&#xD;
that I perhaps.would never see you again has paralyzed any powers&#xD;
of conversation I may have possessed," (gathering courage from her&#xD;
flushed and puzzled countenance), "and I Came to-night to propose&#xD;
to you a question, the answer of which was so uncertain, that, added&#xD;
to the cause I have mentioned, has made me act-Miss Lucy, do you&#xD;
love -me !" I exclaimed, and)it, was outat last.&#xD;
No answer came, but she turned and walled slowly to her chair.&#xD;
Seating herself, she looked curiously. and with a puzzled expression&#xD;
into the fire. I followed and sat down beside her--and there we&#xD;
sat. Every'!nowand then I furtively glanced at her glowing counte-&#xD;
narlce, but could see nothing in its expression to lead me to hope.&#xD;
The clock struck one before either of us spoke. If she loves me it&#xD;
can, not be any extraordinary love, .or she certainly would have&#xD;
made up her mind before this. Leaning over, I took her unresisting&#xD;
hand,. and passing my other arm around her waist, her head fell&#xD;
gently over toward me, and I received one of: those silent answers&#xD;
which pass -from lip to lip and leave the useless ear nothing to&#xD;
record.I&#xD;
Happy was I. No work--,no essay-on that fragile subject, could&#xD;
describe the glowing, thrilling feelings that leapt from string to string&#xD;
of my, trembling frame; and if a just man enjoys happiness, then&#xD;
indeed she played "upon a harp of a, thousand strings." -I was just&#xD;
about to ask her again, "Do you love me ?" in order to receive the&#xD;
"thrilling answer," when over went my office chair, and I came ge&#xD;
bang upon the floor. Gentle reader, pity me, foriit was all a-dream.&#xD;
I had fallen asleep in my ofAce, and awoke sprawling upon tbe floor.&#xD;

During the summer 'months, this cleared portion of the little islet it&#xD;

'Suchis" ind"'sIsland, one of the most lovely of  that celebrated&#xD;
group which stud the bosom of the mighty St. Lawre ce, and are known&#xD;
t- travellers as the "Thousand Islands.'&#xD;
There is a sad story-almost a legend now--of ti is little gem of the&#xD;
St. Lawrence, wlch I will tell you just as I have card it a hundred&#xD;
times from the people at.French Creek and many o the farmers living&#xD;
along the river near the island.&#xD;
Early, otne morning in the month of May, 1817, a ohooner, bound&#xD;
down the river, stopped at French Creekj ,nud landed a delicate, fair-&#xD;
haired girl, with several heavy trunks, and then immediately got under&#xD;
weigh again, and proceeed on her voyage. The girl wa, apparently,&#xD;
about eighteen, very richly dressed, and a tqtal stranger to everybody&#xD;
in the village, and of courieeverybody wondered what on, earth she had&#xD;
come there for. But it was soon ascertained tbat the! stranger had&#xD;
money, which was sufficient to make hera welcome visitor anong the&#xD;
simple-minded villagers,.and invest her with an air of important par.&#xD;
ticularly with the proprietor of the village inn, of whom she engaged&#xD;
rooms for an indeflnite,period, and paid him a quarter's rent and bqard&#xD;
in advance, all in gold.&#xD;
Within three weeks from. the morning- that the beautiful young&#xD;
atranger landed .at French t reek,a rumor went abroad that she had&#xD;
a~irchased, frop a farmer, who had previously inhabited, it, the little&#xD;
island, and was having a small cottage built near the wilkowibasin,,aa it&#xD;
was called, which she intended as her future residence. People learned&#xD;
that the deed of the property and the contract for the building of the&#xD;
cottage were made in, the name of Lin4a Morris,.but that was all they&#xD;
knew of the mysterious stranger, only that shewps .young, beautifulam.,&#xD;
an angel,, apd always wore an air of settled melancholy, almost of&#xD;
anguish, upon her childlike feature* as if some bitter gqief was-preying&#xD;
upon her heart; and when some two months had gone by from the&#xD;
morning that she first made her appearance among them, the cottage&#xD;
was completed, and she removed to her- fairy islet, -the heart's best&#xD;
affections of all went with her; for all, old and young, -loved the gentle&#xD;
being, and the older inhabitants of the village, those who kneiw her&#xD;
best, shook their heads ominously when they spoke of her, andoften&#xD;
'said--                                                 .&#xD;
"Alas I poor girl, she-is dying of a broken heart."-&#xD;
These expressions were' prophetic; for one cold December's afternoon,&#xD;
more than five months after the young recluse had taken up,'her lone&#xD;
residence -in the willow cottage, as peopki calledtit, 'a hunter, who'h"d&#xD;
followed a deer over on these iceto the island, came to the village of&#xD;
French Creek with a message for the doctor, a good 'old man far past&#xD;
the prime of manhood, another fqr the dinister, and yet another for&#xD;
Mrs. Allen, a poor widow of the village, with, whotaLinda hud' been&#xD;
very intimate during her residence at the inn, requesting themi'o eoaun&#xD;
over to the island i mqdiately. -The summons was pomptly obeydd,&#xD;

and when they returned tothe village, after an absence of four days, it&#xD;
was with sad fatces and ladder hearts. for they brought the intelligence&#xD;
that the beautiful reclus&amp;amp;e. ' Linda of the Island," was dead I'&#xD;
Within tlireehours after their arrival at the cottage, she had given&#xD;
birth to a male child, which she confided to the care of the 'ildow. and&#xD;
then, after impirling her secret to the two kind-hearted old me. and&#xD;
the foster mother of he new-born babe, she lingered along, hovering&#xD;
as it were upon the very brink of the grave, for almost four days&#xD;
longer, when her gentle spirit took its flight to a holier, better world.&#xD;
Two days after this sa4 event, the whole population-of the village&#xD;
were assembled at the island cottage. and with a deep solemnity be.&#xD;
fitting the occasion, the body of Linda Morris was consigned to the&#xD;
grave, in a spot she had herself chosen, under a venerable old willow,&#xD;
only a few steps from the cottage. &#xD;
The curiosity and exeitemeit consequent upon an event of so extra-&#xD;
ordinary a nature. gradually subsided-the secret remained fast-locked&#xD;
in the bosoms of those to whoin it had been confided ; and at length,&#xD;
when the spring came again, and the Widow Allen removed from&#xD;
French Crreek to parts unknown, taking with her the infant which had&#xD;
been entrusted to her care. people began to think that the mystery&#xD;
would always remain a mystery, and so dismissed it as nuc as possi-&#xD;
ble from their thoughts.&#xD;
Thd cottage i-emained: unoccupied for nearly a year after the death&#xD;
of Linda, when it was accidentally set on fire by some drunken fisher-&#xD;
nien,'and totally'conumed. The good old niinister of the village held&#xD;
possession of the island, by virtue of sone writin which he- had re-&#xD;
ceived from the recluse; and as he *ould allow no one to settle upon&#xD;
it, or cultivate the soil, it remained for years just as it was at the death&#xD;
of its mysterious, proprietor, except that the cottage was destroyed, as&#xD;
already mentioned.'-1,&#xD;
Such is the story, legend, or' what you will, of Linda's Island ; and&#xD;
stch, ver nearly as I"have described it, was the appearan, of the'&#xD;
delightful little islet tt th6' time our story opens, which 'is in the&#xD;
ninth of May, 1837.&#xD;
It was within' an hour of noon,' on one of the most gloriously beauti-'&#xD;
fal May mornings that ever 'dawned upon, the magnificent scenery of'&#xD;
the St. Lawrence,.that a noble steamer, on her downward courses stop-&#xD;
ped for a few moments abreast of the little promontory at the western&#xD;
end of the island, to land a solitary passenger, who, leaping from the&#xD;
bow of the yawl ag she neafed,1thi white-pebbled beach, turned and&#xD;
waved an~adie'with his hand to a group of fellow-voyagers that had&#xD;
assembled near ihe steamer'A gang-way to bid him farewell.&#xD;
'The steamer went on her wa again, and for full fifteen. minutes the,&#xD;
lone passenger stood there on the beach with his gaze bent upon the&#xD;
forms and faces-'of friends, perhaps, on her deck, till they greW indis-&#xD;
tinct in the dim distance, and finally the steamer herself was lost tc&#xD;
view in the narroa  wiadingiehanwol among the green islands bel6w the&#xD;
