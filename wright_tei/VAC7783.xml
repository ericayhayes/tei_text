perchance tell tales to arouse the ire of this free coun~&#xD;
try. Such tales have been told by some of the very&#xD;
few captives who have regained their liberty; but they&#xD;
have been drowned in the clamour of those who know&#xD;
that no legal means exist for verifying them, and&#xD;
whose i'eligion teaches that to lie for the honour of&#xD;
the Church is meritorious.&#xD;
But if the inmates of convents be happy, what&#xD;
possible harm can ~c~crue from letting the world see&#xD;
their happiness-from overwhelming with confusion&#xD;
those who~assert the contrary? If nuns desire above&#xD;
all things to remain in their paradises, why wall in and&#xD;
ba; anabolt, and lock, and ~guard those paradises more&#xD;
jealously ~than our gaols? If access be still denied,&#xD;
we~c~1nuot believe th~t there is no crime to hide; and&#xD;

foliage ; and now it has found a quiet, lowly channel,&#xD;
where it ripples, clear as crystal, over white pebbles,&#xD;
and green and olive moss ; and its little wavelets are&#xD;
like .liquid gold when the sunbeam glances uponi&#xD;

A child is standing with her eyes fixed upon the&#xD;
stream; its beauty has entered into her very soul, and&#xD;

:very golden ripple, every changeful hue of&#xD;
idpebble is painting itself upon her heart, and&#xD;
apand passionate love of nature has taken pos-.&#xD;
session of her young spirit. A sudden burst of music&#xD;
from an overhanging bough has broken the spell of&#xD;
the waters ; and lookingup to espy the. tiny chorister,&#xD;
she sees him perched against the clear blue sky, with&#xD;
the trellis-work beneath him. How beautiful ! Her&#xD;
eye now wanders over the heavens, and they, in their&#xD;
turn have woven their charm around her. Her foot&#xD;
is upon a stone, her clasped hands are resting upon&#xD;
her knee, and her head is thrown back while she gazes&#xD;
reverently upon the sky. She is already an enthu-&#xD;
A little lower down the glen, near the arch of an&#xD;
old bridge, a lady is seated upon a grey stone, with a&#xD;
small basket in her hand. She rises and approaches&#xD;
the child, saying, ' Come, my love, we must gather our&#xD;
primnroses and return home.'&#xD;
&#xD;
' Mamm a, m amma! did you ever see the sky so&#xD;
eautiful 4s it is to-day ' cried the little maiden. 'I&#xD;
to love spring above all the other sea ons;' Well, the&#xD;
rimroses ! ah ! there is a tuft slily peeping out from&#xD;
he root of that old tree among the moss. I will ga-&#xD;

"Now on mossy banks so green,&#xD;
"Starlike primroses are seen."&#xD;
Is it not sweet to sing to the water ?~ Tinkle, tinkle,&#xD;

'Yes, flowers that never wither.'&#xD;
'Delightful! And a blue sky and little streams?'&#xD;
'A sky that is always bright, and a river of the&#xD;

Ah! poor child, she would go to Heaven for earth-&#xD;

besides her.&#xD;
~fhe primroses were gathered, and the wanderers&#xD;
returned homeward; but the child's mind was filled&#xD;
with heaven, such as she fancied it,-a paradise of&#xD;
blue skies, and dancing streams and little birds. She&#xD;
pictured too the form of a baby-brother there, with&#xD;
bright eyes, and flaxen hair and wings. She had&#xD;
been told that the child was now a cherub; and often&#xD;
she had wondered that her mother who had wept over&#xD;
his death, could not bear to hear her speak of his&#xD;
beauty and happiness. AS'he would always have been&#xD;
talking of him and of his fair home, feeling neither&#xD;
sorrow nor separation; living in an ideal world where&#xD;
he was present. She had sometimes dreamed of him,&#xD;
ud sometimes fancied a rustling among the trees as&#xD;
of viewless wings; and once she had awakened in the&#xD;
morning with the song of an angel ringing in her ears.&#xD;
Those wings and that song, she felt sure were her&#xD;
baby-brother's.&#xD;

burn you, young astraiaomer~.'&#xD;
'I have caught you, sir papa, ha! ha I'&#xD;
'No, you have caught the Great Bear, ready to&#xD;
eat you; ho! ho!'&#xD;
Worrying, laughing, struggling and screaming,&#xD;
the game rose to a perfect uproar, till the appearance&#xD;
of tea acted as a sedative; and when the child retired&#xD;
for the night, stars and primroses were mingled in&#xD;
her dreams. The gentle sleep of childhood fell upon&#xD;
eyes that had looked only upon loveliness and mirth.&#xD;

Two yea s had passed away. Pri roses had come&#xD;
a second ime, and violets and wood anemones were&#xD;
also in t e glen; but they were ui~visited. There&#xD;
was no so nd of mirth in Avon louse; but people&#xD;
spoke low, and trod softly, as if fearf~il of awakening&#xD;
a sleepin~ infant. In a half-darkene~ bed-room hung&#xD;
with black, lay a lady very fair, stilt and silent, like&#xD;
a finely-chiselled marble statue. IBeside the bed&#xD;
kneeled l~er once happy husband, hi~ evening merrb&#xD;
ment gone for ever; and the dark v~sta of a lonely,&#xD;
desolate existence opened despairir~gly before him.&#xD;
There wa~ no light in his soul; all ~v1as black as mid-&#xD;
night; his eye was glassy, unmois4ned by a tear;&#xD;

16             SISTER AGNES.                                                   FIRST SORROW.&#xD;
&#xD;
and his fevered brow and clenched har~d told of the&#xD;
utter departure of joy and hope. H~ presented a&#xD;
strange contrast to the calm, passionless form upon&#xD;
which he gazed. I -&#xD;
Her harp was covered and put into its corner,&#xD;
never more to be played upon; and all the little&#xD;
articles of needle-work and drawing wJ~iich could re-&#xD;
mind him painfully of her, were carefully removed by&#xD;
a faithful old domestic.&#xD;
'Why are the blinds all drawn d9wn~~ said Mary,&#xD;
chokingly, to herself. 'ill want light a~nd. air.' So&#xD;
with a feeling of suffocation, and a strange sense of&#xD;
misery, as of some intolerable load up~n her heart,&#xD;
she put her head behind the blind, and gazed upon&#xD;
the lawn and trees; and then she wi4ied to run-&#xD;
to fly-whither, she cared not, if it wer~ only away;&#xD;
to be any where but in that dim, desolate house.&#xD;
She heard a voice in the room, 'Miss Mary, the&#xD;
dressmaker wishes you a few minutes.' She looked&#xD;
round; a black dress was in the woman hand, she&#xD;
burst into tears, and wept long and passionately.&#xD;
The dressmaker was gone, and the house was still&#xD;
and silent again; and again the longing~ as of a pri-&#xD;
soner for escape, seized the child. She crept into the&#xD;
hall, looked around her, and seeing no one, gently&#xD;
opened the door and fled. With beating heart she&#xD;
ran until she had reached the glen; and then, faint&#xD;
with the violent exertion, and, the terror of' pursuit,&#xD;
&#xD;
she threw herself upon the grass besi~le the grey-stone&#xD;
where her mother used to sit, and wept herself to&#xD;
sleep. Two hours passed over, and still she slept;&#xD;
the sense of misery was lost in tlT~at sweet uncon-&#xD;
sciousness.&#xD;
The loud bark of a greyhound awakened her, and&#xD;
immediately her favourite Di bounded towards her,&#xD;
whined and licked her face, and barked again. She&#xD;
looked up, wondering where* she #as, and saw the&#xD;
old butler, John, approaching her, while her father&#xD;
followed at a little distance. John looked grave and&#xD;
angry at first; but perceiving the tVaces of tears on&#xD;
the countenance of the child, who jnow stood trem-&#xD;
bling at the remembrance of her flight, he said, 'lilt&#xD;
is as II thought, sir~ this is where my lady used to&#xD;
sit, and Miss Mary has been weeping here.' The&#xD;
old man's lip quivered, and tears rolled down his&#xD;
cheeks.&#xD;
Mr. IPercy spoke not, he sat dow~ upon the stone,&#xD;
and folding the child to his bosom his tears also, of&#xD;
'K&#xD;
which the fountain had hitherto b~en locked, burst&#xD;
forth in a copious and refreshing to rent.&#xD;
At Mary's earnest request, she ~was taken to see&#xD;
her mother. Awe-stricken, she conid not speak, she&#xD;
could scarcely breathe. From the cold form before&#xD;
her, so still, so white, so solemn, life~ intelligence,' and&#xD;
love were gone; and in the heart df the child, filial&#xD;
affection gave way to dread. She dared not touch&#xD;

the~corpse; and wondered when nurse kneeled down&#xD;
and kissed the clayeyy hand. Her dreams that night&#xD;
were frightful; she screamed in her sleep, and&#xD;
awakening, entreated to be taken to nurse's bed. Her&#xD;
father bitterly regretted the shock which had been&#xD;
given to her, and ordered her to be carefully kept in&#xD;
future from the room of woe. She never identified&#xD;
that solemn form with her mother; dreams of heaven&#xD;
visited her again, and there in the midst of flowers,&#xD;
and woods and sparkling waters, her~ fancy placed the&#xD;
beloved one, as a being of light, and joy, and beauty;&#xD;
~~-a being, having no connection now with the for-&#xD;
saken clay. In an agony of grief, she saw the fune-&#xD;
ral procession~ move from the house; and yet, the de-&#xD;
parture of the body was rather a relief, for it was not&#xD;
her mother. Away, beyond the blue skies, that be-&#xD;
loved mother walked in* white with her baby brother;&#xD;
and though she wept now when she thought of heaven,&#xD;
it was not quite for sorrow. More sorrowful were&#xD;
her tears when she thought of her walks in spring,&#xD;
and of her merriment on winter evenings. So strong-&#xD;
ly was she possessed by a pleasant idea of her dear&#xD;
one visiting her as a ministering spirit, that on one&#xD;
occasion, she actually uttered aloud the words her&#xD;
heart had dictated to the unseen, whom she imagined&#xD;
to be present.&#xD;
Mr. Percy was not a religious man; he lacked&#xD;
the true source of consolation in his bereavement;&#xD;
&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
FIRST SORROW.              19&#xD;
and it fell with almost intolerable weight upon a heart&#xD;
that had nothing to sustain it but I~uman pride and&#xD;
cold philosophy. He had loved his wife passionately;&#xD;
and with her death the sun of his existence had gone&#xD;
down. He never spoke of her even ~o his little girl;&#xD;
but in the twilight when formerly ~they romped to-&#xD;
gether, or when her mother used t? sing, he often&#xD;
took her on his knee, and while the f~re was unstirred,&#xD;
and the shadows were deep in the room, he rested&#xD;
his face upon her silken hair, and she thought that&#xD;
he wept. In daylight he moved about sad and silent,&#xD;
calling her some me to walk with him, but uttering&#xD;
scarcely a word as they went. The glen he utterly&#xD;
avoided.&#xD;
Thus the child became more and more contempla-&#xD;
tive, and a shadow of premature sadness settled upon&#xD;
her youthful features. She delighted to go alone to&#xD;
the shrubbery, or to entice nurse to the glen, where&#xD;
she marked every varying aspect of the changing sea~&#xD;
sons with deep and passionate deli~ht. Kature be-&#xD;
came her idol; and while she wandered in the midst&#xD;
of its beauties, her imagination rove I in the fields of&#xD;
the unseen, and she held strange converse with. the&#xD;
loved and the lost.&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
EDUCATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Our most; important are our earliest years;&#xD;
"The mind, impressible andsoft, with ease&#xD;
"Imbibes and copies what she hears and sees,&#xD;
"And through life's labyrinth holds fast the clew,&#xD;
"That education gives her, false or true~"    COWPMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
MRS. PERCY had superintended the education of her&#xD;
daughter, which was now for a time neglected, except&#xD;
by her French teacher, who still visited her twice a&#xD;
week. M. Bouquet was a favourite at Avon House,&#xD;
and sometimes Mr. Percy conversed with him for a&#xD;
little after Mary's lessons were over. Mons. B. ven~&#xD;
tured one day to suggest that the time was now come&#xD;
when the careful cultivation of his pupil's mind had&#xD;
become a matter of deep importance; her talents he&#xD;
believed to be considerable, and her disposition so&#xD;
amiable, as to present the promise of a very superior&#xD;
character.&#xD;
'My sister has been urging me,' said Mr. P., 'to&#xD;
send my daughter to be educated along with her&#xD;
children, but this is a sacrifice which I cannot make.'&#xD;
&#xD;
EDUCATION.              21&#xD;
&#xD;
And this was a sacrifice which it would not at all&#xD;
have suited the plans of Monsieur, that Mr. Percy&#xD;
should make at present; though he looked forward&#xD;
with exultation to the time when, after his own ineth-&#xD;
od, she should be torn from her parent's heart, He&#xD;
therefore replied that it would be cruel in the extreme&#xD;
to deprive one so solitary of his only remaining corn-&#xD;
fort; and suggested that a judicious governess might&#xD;
carry on her instruction without depriving him of her&#xD;
society.&#xD;
Mr. P. started. He disliked governesses from&#xD;
unfortunate recollections of his own childhood, and he&#xD;
haughtily replied that he would not see a governess&#xD;
at his lonely table.&#xD;
Monsieur B. dropped the matter for the present,&#xD;
trusting that time would assist in effecting his pur-&#xD;
pose.&#xD;
Soon afterwards, during a visit from his sister,&#xD;
Mr. P. was again assailed by remonstrances on the&#xD;
subject of Mary's education. He firmly refused to&#xD;
part with her; but promised to consider of the pro-&#xD;
priety of engaging a governess.&#xD;
About this time Monsieur Bouquet mentioned to&#xD;
Mary that he was obliged to go to the continent for a&#xD;
week or two, and that, if agreeable to her father, her&#xD;
lessons would be carried on during his absence by a&#xD;
countrywoman of his own, who had resided some time&#xD;
in England with an aged father, whose death had left&#xD;

her solitary and poor. 'My only fear, Miss Percy,'&#xD;
said Monsieur, 'is thai you will be so much ena-&#xD;
moured with your new teacher, as to dismiss me on&#xD;
my return.&#xD;
'Non, non, Monsieur!' replied Mary, laughing,&#xD;
'you know I like old friends better than new.'&#xD;
Mons. B. was six weeks from home, and he had&#xD;
proved a true prophet;, for so completely had his sub-&#xD;
stitute wound herself around the heart of her little&#xD;
pupil that the child wept at the announcement of her&#xD;
departure.&#xD;
'Dearest papa)\ she entreated, 'do invite Made-&#xD;
moiselle Dupin to stay with us a little while; she is&#xD;
so very good, so very kind; she tells me such beau-&#xD;
tiful stories, and seems to love me so much; and she&#xD;
has no home, papa: she must seek one among stran-&#xD;
gers in the wide world, Her mother is dead, and her&#xD;
father is dead,' added the child, bursting into tears.&#xD;
Mr. Percy took her upon his kneewiped her tears,&#xD;
and after a pause inquired, 'Should you like to have&#xD;
this lady for your governess?'&#xD;
'Oh! charming, charming! ' cried the child, spring-&#xD;
ing up and clapping her hands. 'Shall I go and ask&#xD;
her? Let me run, papa, she is not gone yet.'&#xD;
~ Stop, my love,' said Mr. P., smiling; 'you know it&#xD;
will be necessary first to make many inquiries. So&#xD;
you must not excite expectations which may be disap-&#xD;
pointed.'&#xD;
&#xD;
285&#xD;
&#xD;
EDUCATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
'In~juiries? papa. Oh! you know she is good and&#xD;
gentle: at least, I know; and Mons. Bouquet told me&#xD;
how kind she was to her sick father,' urged the little&#xD;
maiden.&#xD;
Mr. P. smiled again, and kissed the youthful&#xD;
leader. 'You must wait,' he said; 'you must not&#xD;
mention it to Mademoiselle; but I will take means to&#xD;
ascertain whether she is a7 proper person to be your&#xD;
governess.~&#xD;
'Kind, kind, dear papa; how happy I shall be!'&#xD;
And the sudden sunshine having dried the April&#xD;
shower of the child's tears, she skipped about the&#xD;
room and sang merrily, while her father summoned&#xD;
all his resolution to do what seemed to be for the&#xD;
welfare and happiness of h~s little daughter.&#xD;

'I~ntirely,' replied the sister. 'Who poetry of her&#xD;
nature; her extreme sensibility and tenderness; the&#xD;
romance of her temperament, and the touch of sadness&#xD;
given by sorrow and solitude, will render it easy to&#xD;
euiamour her with a convent-life. As to her conver-&#xD;
sion from. Protestantism, the poetry of ~ur beautiful&#xD;
ritual, and' the lovely character of the Blessed Yirgin&#xD;
as a mother of the motherless, will, I am quite sure,&#xD;
captivate her young imagination.'&#xD;
'These prints will afford you opportunity of giving&#xD;
useful lessons. Tell her I brought them from Gei~ioa&#xD;

While she admires the Madonna, recite to her Mrs.&#xD;

many Methodists of the lower order, she hadn't very&#xD;

first step, Mademoiselle proposed that the litti  lady&#xD;
who was now growing too old for the nursery, ~hould&#xD;
be transferred to a room which communicate with&#xD;
that of the governess, and the door of which might be&#xD;
left open at night to prevent the feeling of sol~tude.&#xD;
Thus the child would be continually under he~ own&#xD;
eye; and although ,she couki not safely prohibit her&#xD;
evening scripture reading; yet she might select pas-&#xD;
sages for her, and offer upon them such remarks 'as&#xD;
s~iould neutralize their dangerous tendency.&#xD;
Mr. Percy, although agreeing with his governess&#xD;
as to the propriety of remoyin~ his daughter fr6rn so&#xD;
much communication with a mere servant, Would not&#xD;
permit White to be deprived altogether of the ciiarge&#xD;
she'haii long and faithfully performed. She 4s in-&#xD;
stalled as Miss Mary's maid-.~--taking care her&#xD;
Wai'drohe as formerly, and attending to dress 1~er in&#xD;
the morning, although Mademoiselle managed ~o ~u-&#xD;
peAntend personally her evening toilette, in orc~er to&#xD;
read with her before retiring to rest.&#xD;
'I miss my evening talk with my dear lam ,~ re-&#xD;
marked White to the housekeeper; 'it was a weet&#xD;
tiiiie, the darling, when she used' to read, an say&#xD;
hy~riins with he&amp;amp;pretty~'voice; but Mademoisell does&#xD;
read, with 'her, and that is so far well.'&#xD;
'You see,' replied the housekeeper,) she is t be a&#xD;
great lady, v~ery tich, and it seems to me the are&#xD;
afraid of you making her a Methodi~t.'&#xD;
&#xD;
DOMESTIC CHANGES.&#xD;
'The Lord keep her from the follies of the va~n&#xD;
world!' ejaculated White.&#xD;
C Tut, tut,~woman,-a rich heiress must go to balls&#xD;
and tire opera and ~uch things.'&#xD;
White sighed and was silent. 'I'll wager you,&#xD;
said the housekeeper, 'that the first ball she goes to&#xD;
some great prince will take a fancy to her, like Ad&#xD;
Cinderella and her glass slipper. You *snd me ~ill&#xD;
both dance that day with our old limbs1 White.'&#xD;
White tried to smile, but she could not. 'WI~at&#xD;
shall it profit a man though he gain the whole woAd&#xD;
and lose his own soul,' rang. in her ears, - and s e&#xD;
went to her own room to weep and pray for her d r-&#xD;
ling.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the change effected, White as&#xD;
still with Mary more than it suited Mademoise le&#xD;
that she should be; her entire removal from e&#xD;
family was necessary.&#xD;
One or two small articles of jewellery were mi~s~&#xD;
ing from Miss Mary's room; and suspiciQn of d~s-&#xD;
honesty fell, upon a new housemaid. Then the but er&#xD;
reported the mysterious disappearance of ~ piece or&#xD;
two of plate; and, finally, a portrait of Mrs. Per~~y,&#xD;
set with jewels, was abstracted from a cabinet in N~[r.&#xD;
Percy's room. Mr. P. had been unwilling to ha~ve&#xD;
any disturban ~e in the house, until the last theft ~&#xD;
cured. That however, touched him in too ~tende~~ a&#xD;

point; it could not be passed over; a search must&#xD;
be instituted.&#xD;
Mademoiselle concurred~in the probability. f the&#xD;
new housemaid being the guilty person, the oth r&#xD;
mestics having been long tried; ~yet she deter med&#xD;
that it' was impossible to dismiss her upon the mere&#xD;
suspicion of guilt ~ means must be taken to asc rtain&#xD;
it. As she alone was aware of the search ab ut to&#xD;
~e made, ~he. insisted upon placing ~in Mr. P~rcy's&#xD;
hands the key of her ~wn room, ~nd remaining with&#xD;
Miss' Percy until the officer came.&#xD;
'Your rOom, Mademoiselle!' said Mr. Percy,&#xD;
'you do not Suppose that I would subject a lady to&#xD;
~the indignity of a search V&#xD;
Although po~ses~ingthe .birth, the habits, and I&#xD;
trust, the~principles of a lady,' replied Mademoi~ elle,&#xD;
'yet I am astrangerin your house, and if the&#xD;
ing articles be not found with any of the serv~n~s,&#xD;
my repositories must be subjected tG the same prc~cess&#xD;
a~ theirs, if it' were only to .proveTyour impartiality.'&#xD;
' You are right,' said Mr. Percy, 'I esteem our&#xD;
sense of Propriety.'&#xD;
~Yery painful was'such a proceeding to Mr. 'P roy'&#xD;

an~i hj8 grief and indignation at. the los~ of hi be-&#xD;

moned, and their apartments locked up until so e&#xD;
preliminary search was, made. That having failed to&#xD;
discover any of the missing articles,~it was resolved to&#xD;
proceed by rotation, examining first those serva ts&#xD;
whose position in the household was the lowest, a~d&#xD;
proceeding upwards, until, if not found, they should&#xD;
.be sought even with the governess. This plan ~as&#xD;
the suggestion of Mademoiselle, 'who' remarked that&#xD;
thus the upper servants would probably be spa~ed&#xD;
the painful investigation.&#xD;
Nothing had been discovered; with the n w&#xD;
housemaid was found nothing to excite suspicion; he&#xD;
rest were equally faultless; White, the housekeep r,&#xD;
and Mademoiselle Dupin, alone remained.&#xD;
'It is enough,' said Mr. Percy, 'I cannot ins It~&#xD;
two old, tried servants and a lady.'&#xD;
White and the housekeeper requested that ~he&#xD;
search might proceed-the former spoke faintly; he&#xD;
had religious papers in her box ~which she 8hr nk&#xD;
from having unveiled. The officer noticed her h si-&#xD;
tation, and fixed his eyes upon her.&#xD;
'In justice, sir, you must proceed now,' said'  he&#xD;
governess.&#xD;
"Tis amazing, sir,' remarked the officer, 'k~ow&#xD;
often things are found with the very person you wo~ild&#xD;
least suspect.'&#xD;
It was then White's turn.. In the bottom of ~&#xD;

flushed cou~itenance, ~he- hastily drew open a ~mall&#xD;
drawer beneath; and there, to the astonishine~it of&#xD;

with an ironical grin, 'I knowed it from her ~&#xD;

The ether servants held their breath and looked&#xD;

'The woman?~ face was enough for me,' sa~d the&#xD;
man; 'but justice is justice for every one.'&#xD;
She did look strangely,' said Mr. Percy, ridging&#xD;
~he bell. i-James, send Dawson here.'&#xD;
Dawson was the upper-housemaid, and sh~ was&#xD;
nterrQgated whether White was in the ha1~it of&#xD;
leaving, her boxes opens or of keeping'~ them locked.&#xD;
$he said that ~he had never seen the large b9~. un-&#xD;
locked, she believed White to have, been particularly&#xD;
careful about that; the smaller box, where the plate&#xD;
was found, and drawers, where she kept her uslin&#xD;
things~ were always open.'&#xD;
'Then, sir,' observed the officer 'if nothing had&#xD;
been found in the lockup box, there would have been&#xD;
a doubt-.-t~ut t4~-4 settles the matter.'&#xD;
The swoon i~as long, but the unhappy *orn~,n at&#xD;

'You go to your bed, my lady, and hold your&#xD;

'Won't he send me to gaol 'V inquired poor&#xD;
White, suddenly becoming calm, and bursting into&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
'No, spite of all the gentleman~ and we could&#xD;
say, my master wouldn't give you what you deserve,&#xD;
you ungrateful, hypocritical wretch!'&#xD;
'0 God,. thou art the stay of the innocent, a&#xD;
refuge in times of trouble!' sobbed the woman,&#xD;
throwing herself upotL the bed. Then, burying b1er&#xD;
face in the bed-clothes, she wept hysterically.&#xD;
'No~ie of your Scripture !' said the housekeeper;&#xD;
'I never saw any good come of saints-she that&#xD;
couldn't look at a dance in the hall! though she drid&#xD;
deceive both my ~lady and me,' said Mrs. Brown,&#xD;
turning to Mademoiselle.&#xD;
'Well, good Mrs. Brow~, do not be~ too hard upon&#xD;

'No. suspicion rests upon us, n&amp;amp;w that .t~ guilty&#xD;

Mademoiselle.&#xD;

had. rendered it certain" that matters would. not be&#xD;
.p~iished 4o this extremity; she knew right well where&#xD;
the missing articles would be found, or she would&#xD;
uev~er h.ave hazarded a search. She had in her pos-&#xD;

These might have escaped unread; but there&#xD;
were &amp;amp;lso s~k~eleton keys, popish symbols and books,&#xD;
a manual of Jesuit moralss, and other things which&#xD;
owo~d have rendered the exposure of mademoisellee&#xD;
Dupiti's secret repositories' far more astounding than&#xD;
if a1,l'thejewel~ in the hottse had been found in them.&#xD;
Yet ~Eademoiselle was a religious woman-a sin-&#xD;

with the following note.&#xD;

Mr. Percy was touched; he paced about the&#xD;
room uneasily, sat for some time in a thoughtful&#xD;
mood, and finally summoned Mademoiselle, who had,&#xD;
in truth, by this time gained much of his confidence.&#xD;
' Is it not possible,' said he, 'th~t there has been&#xD;

'Ifear that is tootrue; ~have known some strange&#xD;

Mr. Percy shrank as with sudden pain. "mi..&#xD;

I There is always danger, sir,' replied Mademo~-&#xD;
selle, in young people being with even the best 6f&#xD;
servants. What has now happened, will, I trust,&#xD;
'quicken me to greater and more affectionate vigilance&#xD;
in the care of my sweet young charge.'&#xD;
'I thank you, Mademoisella.'&#xD;
Meanwhile Mary had crept up stairs to. her&#xD;
nurse's room. She tapt at the door, but receiving no&#xD;
answer, she stood a minute, and heard the voice Qf&#xD;
sobs mingled with these ejaculations. '0 God, thQil&#xD;

"Thought and affliction, passion; hell itselZ&#xD;

IT 'was a winter afternoon. The shutters were not&#xD;
closed, nor the lights brought; but the blinds were&#xD;
drawn down, and the' fire stirred, and its cheerfulxrays&#xD;
glanced and flickered upon our young heroine and her&#xD;
governess, as' they sat together before it, throwing&#xD;
their shadows far into the room; brightening promi-&#xD;
nent objects with changeful gleam, and ' deepening&#xD;
into chiar.oscuro'all behind those objects~ 7afld every&#xD;
recess. The lights~and. shades would have gladdened&#xD;
the very soul of Rembrandt or Corregio. I{dt with&#xD;
the eye of an artist, 'but with that deep poetic feeling&#xD;
which was a part of her nature, Mary gave herself up&#xD;
to the enjoyment of the hour. There was nothing to&#xD;
mar its pleasure, for not~ merely the elegancie~of life,&#xD;
but all the elements that enter into that IEngii~h' idea,&#xD;
comfort, wer&amp;amp;th~re.' Mademoiselle 'lounged iii a high-&#xD;

with slow and measured time, moved backwards aud&#xD;
forw~r4s in a rocking-chair, or-balanced herself on its&#xD;
edge to look around her into the 'room. The child&#xD;
was happy, but not satisfied; there was a longing in&#xD;
her soul aft~r something higher and nobler than earth&#xD;
can give, but she knew not where to seek it.' 'Tell&#xD;
me, Mademoiselle,' she said; 'one of your dear de-&#xD;
lightful stories about the supernatural; and first say&#xD;
if you think that there really a'e angels here, up in&#xD;

without preface she tEus coimnenced:&#xD;
At the base of the Pyrenees, in a lowly valley of&#xD;
Spain stood the' castle of Don Alfonso Alcarras. His&#xD;
son Ferdinand was a.handsomehigh~spirited youth;&#xD;

sweet incense flung from a golden cen~er. The very&#xD;
bandit would.not have touched a h~ir of the head of&#xD;
the Donna Isabella, so greatly was she re'&amp;amp;\ered.&#xD;
Thus her earliest days were passed, and many a&#xD;
patrician youth sought the hall of Don Alfonso to&#xD;
kneel at the shrine of his lovely daughter.&#xD;
But Isabella's heart was fixed on heaven; 'no sha-&#xD;

cadaverous oeuntenan~e~ was surrounded b~y the4hh~k&#xD;
folds of her white 'linen hood; her person was&#xD;

and when the' carriage had; passed into the ~ou4&#xD;

The 'court was a gloomy square, surrounded 'by&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7783-00000055"/>&#xD;
centre door, opposite the gate, opened, and the La&#xD;
Superior stepped out. She was tall and sallow, w&#xD;
white -hood, serge gown, rosary 'and crucifix ;&#xD;
features were fine, but stern and melancholy. Sta&#xD;
ing erect, she stretched out both hands to Miss Per&#xD;
then kissed her forehead, and pronounced a bene4&#xD;
tion. She led her into a small room where a fru&#xD;
repast 'was spread, and bade her be seated.&#xD;
hushed solemnity of all around, awed and plea&#xD;
her, although the place was plain even to meanne&#xD;
and she felt a little disappointed by the want of h&#xD;
fretted'roofs and stained windows, which, someho&#xD;
other she had pictured even in the domicile of a 1&#xD;
Abbess. She ate but little, and was shown to&#xD;
own: apartment, which she found small and dim,&#xD;
tolerably comfortable;' and she gladly threw her&#xD;
hausted frame upon the little cottage-bed w&#xD;
occupied one corner, for sofa or easy chair there ~&#xD;
none. Two cane-bottomed chairs, a small rot&#xD;
table, with a crucifix upon it, and her bed, were&#xD;
chief furniture of the room; and a transient de&#xD;
sion stole over her as she contrasted it with her&#xD;
elegant chamber in her father's house. Shex&#xD;
her eyes, however, upon the crucifix, and strove&#xD;
meditate ; but her thoughts flitted to and fro in&#xD;
fusion, until they were dissipated by the ringin&#xD;
the convent-bell, when a sister entered 'to inqui' e&#xD;

She accompanied her through the narrow corridor,&#xD;
to the door which opened into' the cloisters, where&#xD;
they joined the procession of the nuns moving slowly&#xD;
along the aisles in their dark robes. The architec-&#xD;
ture was not remarkably striking, hut the solemn&#xD;
gloom pleased her ; it accorded with her ideas of&#xD;
religion, which was truly a religion of the senses.&#xD;
The chapel was small, but fine ; the tapers on the&#xD;
altar, the officiating priest,' the dark kneeling figures&#xD;
of the sisters, the high vaulted roof; filled with the&#xD;
swell of music, wrought up her mind to a high pitch&#xD;
of what she considered devotion. She was overcome&#xD;
and wept.&#xD;
The service over, the Mother Superior offered her&#xD;
her arm, and conducted her to her own private room,&#xD;
where they had tea alone. She spoke soothingly to&#xD;
her victim; assured her of the deep interest sihe took&#xD;
in her; promised her peace and holiness beyond her&#xD;
most sanguine expectations, and crossing her hands&#xD;
on her breast and looking upwards, exclaimed, ' Oh !&#xD;
the life of a nun is indeed a holy, happy life.'&#xD;
Miss Percy looked upon her with reverence and&#xD;
something like affection. 'Reverend Mother,' she&#xD;
.said, 'it cost me a pang to leave those I loved ; to&#xD;
leave them so desolate; but the vanities of the world&#xD;
were hateful to me ; I sighed, for purity and spiritu-&#xD;
ality. I will pray for the consolation of my father,&#xD;

operations there; after which he was removed t~ a&#xD;

Mr. Percy's estate Was strictly entailed 'in he&#xD;

efforts were made for his conversion to Remani~m,&#xD;
otherwise the paralytic i~ian would in all ~robabil~ty&#xD;
have had some- ecclesiastical consolation in his trials;&#xD;
as it was, he was left to bear them as best he might.&#xD;
Fretful and discontented, no one could. please Nm.&#xD;
He would order his daughter to be sent for, bitterly&#xD;
chiding her undutifulness in remaining s~ long fr~om&#xD;
hiin,~ then the~remembrance of the truth would hi~rst&#xD;
upon his mind, and he would weep like an infaiit;&#xD;
again he would draw himself erect, an~  utter upon&#xD;
her some fearful . malediction. Another stroke de.&#xD;
proved him of articulatien~ and many a weary day he&#xD;
lay helpless, attended carefully 'by the 'faithful old&#xD;
housekeeper, who, ever and anon broke ~t'orth, some-&#xD;
times in apology for her young mistress, som~time~iu&#xD;
indignation against her.&#xD;
The old nurse White, was sheltered. by&#xD;
who, with the instinct of Christian love, fully&#xD;
her innocence of the charges made against her. $~&#xD;

to proceed to America, offered to take her with him.&#xD;

&#xD;
may not touch a mite of it-sworn to poverty, forsootl~!&#xD;
I am building up power, and am rewarded by chains&#xD;
aryd slav~ry-vowed to obedience!&#xD;
'My order is enriched and glorified, truly, but&#xD;
what is that to me, so long as I have personal con-&#xD;
sciousness, and not brahminical absorption into the&#xD;
great essence of the church? What am I benefitted&#xD;
by all I am doing? Like the bee, I am but toiling for&#xD;
others; and when my honey is made, if it suit them, I&#xD;
shall ~be destroyed. This is the fate of Rome's obe-&#xD;
dient sons! Fools! to heap up treasures which we&#xD;
may never touch,---to build a chariot, at the wheels&#xD;
of which we shall be dragged. It is well enough for&#xD;
those who fancy they have souls to be saved, and that&#xD;
such deeds will save them; but for me, and for hun-&#xD;
dreds like me who know better-.--who know that the&#xD;
grave is our endless home-why should we deny our-&#xD;
selves andtoil night and day? "Let us eat and drink,&#xD;
for to-morrow we die!"&#xD;
'Rome, I could almost cast thee off, turn heretic,&#xD;
and revenge myself upon thy despotism, by exposing&#xD;
and crushing it! Nay, this would not improve the&#xD;
case; it would not aggrandize me; it would only gra-&#xD;
~ify the adversaries I have sworn to quelL&#xD;
'But stay. Have I really achieved nothing for&#xD;
myself? I have. I have gained a victory; there is&#xD;
delight in that. I have Aaccompli~hed my purpose-&#xD;
satisfied n~y will---what more could Jove have done?&#xD;
&#xD;
My will is myself, or what am I-vanity, appetite,&#xD;
fame? For these all the world labour\; but my vanity,&#xD;
my appetite, my fame, are something I possess; they&#xD;
are not myself: nay, they are things which may be&#xD;
my masters, while my will is a part of my essence, an&#xD;
emanation of my very being.' * * *&#xD;
Here the father lost himself in a labyrinth of me-&#xD;
taphysics. After some time he proceeded.&#xD;
'It seems to be an immutable law of nature that&#xD;
atoms can effect nothing separately; they must exist&#xD;
and act in masses. In a universe of unconnected par-&#xD;
ticles, no one particle could possess any thing except&#xD;
its own existence. In an army of self-governed, self-&#xD;
acting soldiers, no one would achieve a victory--all&#xD;
would be defeated. Each atom shares the good of it~&#xD;
mass; each soldier reaps the glory of his army. I&#xD;
must e content to lose my individuality; 'tis hard,&#xD;
but it is fate! The church allows license enough to&#xD;
its pr ests in pleasure, if not in profit: few delights&#xD;
save hat of liberty are withheld from us.&#xD;
et why am I, with this burning soul within me,&#xD;
kept y the tyrant laboring in obscurity? I will de-&#xD;
mand a higher mission-to the salons of Paris--to the&#xD;
court of princes; life I mu.9t, I will enjoy. Let those&#xD;
who ave souls, labour for theirgood; mine it shall be&#xD;
to li~e while I live,-.--or Rome, I abjure thee!&#xD;
KPool ! might not I have wooed this heiress for&#xD;
myself, instead of for the church? Ah! Padre Carlo;&#xD;

'Well, he is not vulgar like Father Dennis, bu~&#xD;
his eye frightens me, and he is so terribly austere&#xD;
yet he is a gentleman. Father Dennis is not. Waft&#xD;
it for that you chose him?' said Miss S.&#xD;
'Oh! never mind my reasons, choose for ~ourself~&#xD;
replied Sister Agnes. 'Father O'llooran is the mor&#xD;
dignified, but Father Dennis, I dare say, will be th&#xD;
more indulgent.'&#xD;
'And will understand such matters as mine best,&#xD;
said Miss S.; 'but no, gravity is the thing whe&#xD;
one is in distress. Will you, dear, request th&#xD;
reverend mother to send for Father O'llooran imme&#xD;

'Immediately, dear?' asked Agnes in surprise.&#xD;
'Yes, immediately; my heart ~s breaking, and&#xD;
must confess.'&#xD;
Sister Agnes did as she was requested, and t&#xD;
her surprise the Superior made no objection, bu&#xD;
instantly dispatched a messenger for Fathe&#xD;
O'llooran.&#xD;
The secret was duly confided to his ear, and re&#xD;
ceived with becoming concern. 'There is consider&#xD;
able cruelty, my daughter,' he said, 'in treating yoi~&#xD;
so. I do fear all is not right with him. For th&#xD;
sake of your own peace, you had better withdraw~&#xD;
your thoughts as much as possible from one who~&#xD;
seems to have so little appreciation of your value.&#xD;

it is well that he shows his neglect before the matter&#xD;
is irremediable. You may thus be saved the pang&#xD;
which hundreds feel, of being slighted after mar-&#xD;
riage.'&#xD;
'Is that a common case, father ~'inquired Miss S.&#xD;
'I must not betray the secrets of the confession-&#xD;
al,' said the father, 'but I may say that all young&#xD;
women ought to mark the first appearai~ice of coolness&#xD;
on the part of those to whom they entrust their hap-&#xD;
piness. I believe that nineteen out of twenty mar-&#xD;
ried persons wish themselves loosed again.'&#xD;
'Then, father,' said Miss. S., 'you do think the&#xD;
letter cool'?'&#xD;
'Distressingly so,' replied the father.&#xD;
'What shall I do?' inquired the poor girl.&#xD;
'If after his treatment, you think him worth the&#xD;
trouble,' said the confessor, 'you may say ten ayes&#xD;
and perform five stations every day on bare knees,&#xD;
from the chapel-door to the image of the Virgin. It&#xD;
may be she will reconcile him to you, if for the good&#xD;
of your soul.'&#xD;
'Endure such humiliation for a man who neglects&#xD;
me!' cried Miss S. 'INo, father, if he cares not for&#xD;
me, I care not for him.'&#xD;
'Becoming spirit, my daughter,' said the priest.&#xD;

What was the end she had in view? To be a stunt&#xD;
-to be fre&amp;amp; from sin, to utter no murmur, to lhwe&#xD;
self subdued, to lose herself in extatic eontemplat~on,&#xD;
to rise by a royal road of suffering to a throng in&#xD;
heaven, to an immortal crown. Was she one ~hit&#xD;
nearer this consummation than when she entered the&#xD;
monastery? Alas! no. She had more disquiet de,&#xD;
more rebellion of the will, was more frequently tenipt~&#xD;
ed to evil passions, could indulge less in spiri4ial&#xD;
visions,-was altogether much farther movedd fVom&#xD;

gatory. Well; that was worth suffering for now;&#xD;
therefore she would persevere, she would set before&#xD;
her this end to inspirit her fiuiling heart, to quicken hexi&#xD;
lingering footsteps. But such a load of earthiness&#xD;
and sin hung around her-how was she to get rid&#xD;
it ~ Only by suffering-by voluntary suffering. L&#xD;
should be done. She had given up 'all her worldly&#xD;
happiness, and it would be folly to lose both that and&#xD;
eternal life; therefore a saint she would be, a saint&#xD;
according to the true, orthodox idea, revolting as that&#xD;
might be to all her natural feelings.&#xD;
'I must have discipline, father,' she said to her,&#xD;
confessor, '1 am still so worldly, have so much regret&#xD;
for the past, so much recoiling from the present.'&#xD;
'Recite the psalm Miserere,' he said, 'and be-&#xD;
tween each verse receive four lashes from the hands&#xD;
of two of the sisters; then pass half-an-hour pros-&#xD;
trate before the Virgin, in meditation upon her&#xD;
merits. Jf there are any of the sisters who you think&#xD;
have a grudge at you, select them to ~give you the&#xD;
discipline.'&#xD;
Sisters Monica and An~elica were selected, the&#xD;
penitent kneeled down, her shoulders were bared;&#xD;
the women, each with a scourge in her hand, took&#xD;
their places beside her; she chanted the first verse,&#xD;
and then sharp and heavily the strokes fell. The&#xD;
psalm numbers twenty verses in the Vulgate, so that&#xD;
eighty stripes were inflicted; ~he habit was then&#xD;
&#xD;
"Tho penitent kneeled down, bei boulders were bared."&#xD;

drawn over the excoriated shoulders, and the victim&#xD;
9rawled to the image of the Virgin, where she lay&#xD;
prostrate haIf~an~hour.* Imagine the effort of rising,&#xD;
with the dress here and there adhering to the wound-&#xD;
ed flesh, and the exhaustion which had been induced;&#xD;
and wonder not that as she lay, her meditation was a&#xD;
mQckery; that holy thoughts an~1 blessed feelings&#xD;
refused to come, and that all her heroism was re~&#xD;
I&#xD;
quisite to repress visible impatience and audible cries&#xD;
of pain.&#xD;
Was she holier that night than before'? Alas!&#xD;
no. But she almost thought she had a conflict with&#xD;
a demon. This was a privilege of saintship.&#xD;
Sister Agnes was next directed to fast for a week,&#xD;
taking only once a day a little water and bread&#xD;
sprinkled with ashes; and twice each day to proceed&#xD;
round the cloisters on naked knees; then retire to&#xD;
her cell, and spend the remaining hours in meditation&#xD;
on the sufferings of Christ in unison with her own.&#xD;
No one will be surprised that she fainted several&#xD;
times while performing the stations, and no Protest.'&#xD;
ant will wonder that her own sufferings occupied her&#xD;
mind more than those of the Saviour. This she&#xD;
deeply deplored. The spiritual exercises of Loyola&#xD;
were next resorted to. Physical weakness had now&#xD;
induced mental languor, for she was enfeebled by&#xD;

fasting and pain; she could not control her thought&#xD;
Eagerly she commenced the first sacred subject, an~&#xD;
yet with all the tangible assistance which knowledge&#xD;
of human nature, and ignorance of God's grace ha~&#xD;
suggested, she could not continue. In ten minute~&#xD;
there was a vacuum in her mind, or it was listlessl~r&#xD;
roaming among images of the past, or occupied with&#xD;
some petty detail of daily life. She wept, she faste&#xD;
she disciplined herself; she could force the body t~&#xD;
obey, but that ize~tless, roving, uncontrollable thin&#xD;
the mind-what cords could bind it-what suffering~&#xD;
could subdue it? Day after day, it seemed to be~&#xD;
come more rebellious. Often she lost the thread o~&#xD;
her subject, and had to return after an interval of~&#xD;
vacuity; and oftener still, no emotion was excited~&#xD;
by the thrilling theme upon which she tried to&#xD;
meditate.&#xD;
Well does the true Christian know the bitterness&#xD;
of such a conflict; but in his case, it is maintained&#xD;
in a strength beyond his own, and he is made more&#xD;
than a conqueror through Him who loved him.&#xD;
* Poor sister Agnes knew of no such Almighty&#xD;
helper. She struggled with corruption alone.&#xD;
She almost resolved to give up the contest, for&#xD;
despair seized her, ~s the enmity oii~er natural heart&#xD;
to divine things unfolded itself. She should never&#xD;
be a saint; then let her be a daughter again. She&#xD;
was only a novice; she need not become a nun. She&#xD;
&#xD;
would return toher forsaken home. But, ah! would&#xD;
she be received? Her father did not deign to notice&#xD;
her now; she could not hold up her head in society;&#xD;
and her soul would be irrecoverab4,' lost. Her&#xD;
destiny was fixed-fixed in this breathing tomb for&#xD;
life!&#xD;
Such thoughts tormented her.&#xD;

the Super oress knew all this too, and as usual, she&#xD;
relied upo neither assertioiinor oath; in fact, in the&#xD;

they lived mutual, universal distrust.&#xD;

THE nuns were seated at breakfast in the refectory;&#xD;
not a voice was heard, for they ate ~n silence. Their&#xD;
scanty meal was only begun, when ~the superior com-&#xD;
manded them to pause.&#xD;
'My daughters,' she said, 'a gre~t privilege awaits&#xD;
you to-day. A holy man from a distant land is cx-&#xD;
peeteci to arrive soon after noon wits a most precious&#xD;
relic, which he will exhibit to you; ~t is a fragment of&#xD;
the sword which, on the d~y of her Son's crucifixion,&#xD;
pierced the heart of the blessed Yirgin: as it is&#xD;
written, "Yea, a sword shall pierce thine own soul&#xD;

The hungry nuns arose from table and one of&#xD;
them collected the remains of the' cal which, if&#xD;
finished, would have been quite insuffic ent for their&#xD;
healthful sustenance. Considerable in nt attached&#xD;

WE have mentiofied sister Marie as a remarkably ami-&#xD;
able, though pensive girl; along with sister Tiieresa,&#xD;
she had charge of the young prisoner, Phemie Keegan.&#xD;
The strong piety of the child made a deep impression&#xD;
upon the mind of' the nun, and she treasured up in&#xD;
her heart many expressions which fell from her ward.&#xD;
The Spirit of God carried them with saving power to&#xD;
her heart. She had had early exercises of mind some-&#xD;
what similar to those of Luther, although less intense;&#xD;
she had been convinced of sin, and had fled to the&#xD;
usual popish arts to quiet her conscience,---to atone&#xD;
for her guilt. But the more she labored, the more&#xD;
unhappy she became; all her efforts after sanctity&#xD;
issued only in stronger and more fearful convictions&#xD;
of guilt. So far, there was a siniilarit~r between her&#xD;

case and that of sister Agnes; but tjaere was one ir~&#xD;
portent difference, it consisted in perception of ti&#xD;
intrinsic evil of sin, and of its desert. Sister Mar~&#xD;
felt herself to be condemned by th&amp;amp; righteous law&#xD;
God-she labored under the apprehension of&#xD;
wrath, for the breach of that; law ;-Sister Agn~&#xD;
merely grdancd under her inability to reach a stand~&#xD;
of perfection which she had set up for herself; tl~&#xD;
one sighed to escape judgment, the other to attai&#xD;
merit; the one was convinced of the law as a tram&#xD;
gressor, the other was downcast because of weal~nes;&#xD;
It is much to feel the want of s1rengt~; but strength&#xD;
cannot be reached tillpardon be attai~ied-andpardo&#xD;
sister Agnes sought not at all, sister M~arie sought I&#xD;
long, but in a way in which it. never ~an be found.&#xD;
But the grace and wisdom of Go~ are wonderful&#xD;
He made the wrath of man to praise him; and whe&#xD;
by that wrath a simple peasant-girl ~as imprisoned&#xD;
he rendered her the means of conveying to her force&#xD;
abode, the( light and glory of the gospel.&#xD;
Sister Marie soon perceived that Phemie had four~&#xD;
that which she had so long sought in vain, peace wit~&#xD;
God; and timidly and warily she str~ve to elicit froi~&#xD;
her the means by which she had attained it, und~&#xD;
terred by the dread of heresy. Phemie had the spin&#xD;
of the apostles of old; she had been forbidden, unde&#xD;
pain of all i~hat was dreadful, to breathe 'heresy' t&#xD;
one of the l~ly sisterhood, and they were commanded&#xD;

by their obedience, to divulge any attempt she might&#xD;
make to pervert them; but she feared not man when&#xD;
duty to God lay before her, and she courageously un-&#xD;
folded to sister Marie, the simple plan of salvation by&#xD;
Jesus Christ, made known in the Gospel. The nun&#xD;
sought no proof of the superior claim of that doctrine&#xD;
upon her faith; she felt its adaptation to her spiritual&#xD;
wants; she saw that what fasts and vigils, and prayers&#xD;
and tortures, could not do, Christ had done; she&#xD;
accepted him as her Saviour, with simple7 child-like&#xD;
confidence, and the burden of her soul fell off at the&#xD;
foot of the cross. Fain would she have spent hour&#xD;
after hour with her instructress, who repeated to her&#xD;
as time permitted, portions of the word of God; but&#xD;
this could not be. To excite the jealousy of her Supe-&#xD;
rior, would have been to cut herself off entirely from&#xD;
intercourse with her young friend, and to s~ibject both&#xD;
of them to the greatest, danger. But she had an&#xD;
efficient teacher. The iloly Ghost can enlighten the&#xD;
soul thr ugh the most imperfect medium; and He&#xD;
convey saving truth to the mind of the nun, as it&#xD;
fell in so aps and short sentences from the lips of his&#xD;
suffering child. Marie soon grasped. all that was&#xD;
requisite for salvation and jcLy, and became a humble&#xD;
believer a heretic if you will.&#xD;
Very sweet were the light and peace which entered&#xD;
her soul after its long darkness and conflict; she truly&#xD;
rejoiced in God through Jesus Christ her Lord&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7783-00000121"/>&#xD;
that joy strengthened her Lot a fiery trial which wa&#xD;
to try her. Her youthful instructress had sought onl&#xD;
to convey to her mind the truths of the Gospel; bu&#xD;
these necessarily overthrew some of the errors o&#xD;
Rome. The doctrine of justification by Christ alon&#xD;
of course shook to its foundations that of the men&#xD;
of 'saintsandof penances, and of good works; th&#xD;
doctrine of One Mediator, struck at the root of adora&#xD;
tion of the Virgin; and forgiveness of sins by Go&#xD;
himself, rendered useless absolution~ by a priest.&#xD;
Marie's change of feeling, therefore, ~ould not long&#xD;
remain unknown; but meanwhile her faith rough&#xD;
in her some of the graces which are ~ts fruits. She&#xD;
became still more amiable than before; and sister&#xD;
Agnes in particular, who had always 'loved her, now&#xD;
clung to her more closely.&#xD;
She ventured one day to say to her,' Sister Mari~,&#xD;
I begin to despair of ever becoming a saint. You~&#xD;
cannot think what evil feelings spring up in my heart.&#xD;
You are so meek, and gentle, and calm, and amiable,~&#xD;
that I think you must have attained to much sanctity.&#xD;
Tell me what penances and m6rtifications you secretly&#xD;
practise; help me, Marie, if you can.'&#xD;
'I practise no secret fortifications at all,' replied&#xD;
Marie.&#xD;
'None!' exclaimed Agnes, in surprise.&#xD;
'None; h~ve found One who bore all the penal-&#xD;
ty of my sine ~&amp;amp;,,me.'&#xD;

'What great saint was that?'&#xD;
'Jesus Christ, the holy Son of God!'&#xD;
'Oh! of course, but then ;-'&#xD;
'Listen, dear, while we are alone, and I will tell&#xD;
you all. I Ion g strove to work out a righteousness of&#xD;

K         the wrath of God, because all I could do was, so im-&#xD;
perfect, so vile. In my childhood I knew portions of&#xD;
the Scriptures, and now God sent one with power to&#xD;
my soul. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with&#xD;
all thy heart, and all thy soul, and all thy strength;"&#xD;
and again, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus&#xD;
Christ, let him be anathema, maranatha." A horror&#xD;
of great darkness fell upon me; I became conscious of&#xD;
a fearful sin I had never seen before-the absence of&#xD;
love to God and Christ; and while I tried to love&#xD;
I felt I hated. Then I was anathema, maranatha.&#xD;
'I had thought of God as a very dreadful being, to&#xD;
be app~tsed only by her whom we call his mother-.&#xD;
it seem d impossible to love him-and if I loved him&#xD;
fiot I was accursed. I was in great agony. I went&#xD;
to y confessor, and he exhorted me to meditation,&#xD;

his dear servants. She told me of Christ's love&#xD;
me, of his bearing my&#xD;
'A sweet conversation, sisters, apparently,' cri&#xD;
the lady Superior, suddenly appearing, 'you wi&#xD;
please to inform me what is the subject.'&#xD;
'We were speaking,' replied sister Agnes, 'i&#xD;
our sins, of the difficulty of resisting them, and of ti&#xD;
penances which ~vere ordered sister Marie for h(&#xD;
great sin of not loving God.'&#xD;
'Sister Marie had better think a little more&#xD;
the sin of neglecting the 11 lot her of God,' retort~&#xD;
- the Superior, 'she is the Qate of Heaven, the Que~&#xD;
of Angels, the Sinner's Refuge; and sister Marid&#xD;
prayers, I begin to fear, are all pater-nosters witho~&#xD;
aires. I forbid you to speak together again.~&#xD;
Agnes was astonished, and still more so when tE&#xD;
reverend mother commanded Marie to retire to hE&#xD;
cell, where she was to have nothing but bread and w~&#xD;
ter for three days. She forbade sister Agnes t&#xD;
mention the subject of their conversation to the re&amp;amp;&#xD;
and remarked, 'There is too much reason to believe&#xD;
that that girl is touched with heresy.'&#xD;
'She 1' exclaimed Agnes, 'who i~so gentle an&#xD;
obedient.'&#xD;
'Little know you of obedience,' said th~ Superio&#xD;
snappishly, 'if you consider sister Marie obedient&#xD;
she deserves to be made an example, a warning to th&#xD;
community. Come to my room?&#xD;

Sister Agnes followed the lady, and then was de-&#xD;
sired to lace her boots. As she stooped to obey, and&#xD;
commenced the lacing of' one boot, the Superior&#xD;
placed her other foot upon the head of the nun, who&#xD;
attempted to look up in mingled astonishment and in-&#xD;
dignation; but her head was firmly pressed down,&#xD;
and she was commanded to be still.&#xD;
'I make a footstool ofyour head,' said the Superior,&#xD;
'to test your obedience, and your humility. It is&#xD;
good for you. You will please not to stir till IL re-&#xD;
move my foot? Lower your head.'&#xD;
The poor girl repressed by a sudden effort, her&#xD;
rising anger; resting upon her knees and hands,&#xD;
with her face nearly touching the ground, she remained&#xD;
until the blood suffused her brow, her head palpitated,&#xD;
and she 5~sped for breath. The Superior at length&#xD;
released her, satisfied with her "obedic~nce."&#xD;
She felt insulted, but she tried to acquiesce in the&#xD;
scale of her merits-a scale light enough, she knew.&#xD;
She never saw Marie again; the nun was heard&#xD;
of no more; no one in the convent seemed to know&#xD;
what had 1~ecome of her. Agnes felt that she had&#xD;
lost a friend, and her heart was withered mo~e and&#xD;
more. She strove to dismiss from her mind the&#xD;
words which the Superior had stigmatised as heresy&#xD;
but a portion of them stuck fh~st, like an arrow in her&#xD;
conscience ;-they were the same which had wrought&#xD;
conviction in Mai4e, '~ If any man love not the Lord&#xD;

c-ame down and made a mistake.'&#xD;
'Erom their mortified appearance,' said Father&#xD;
O'llooran, with a grim smile.&#xD;
Now i~ather Dennis was a true Irish cleri&amp;amp;d&#xD;
dandy; fat and grea~sy-1ooking, with broad cheek~,&#xD;
large mouth, and small eyes. His unbrushed clothes&#xD;
were made of the finest possible cloth, tinted with.&#xD;
dust and daubs. How much this cloak had cost I&#xD;
am quite unable to tell; but its clasp was of massive&#xD;
gold, and) its lining of the richest silk, torn here and&#xD;
there, while the mire through which he had riddeii&#xD;
had not been brushed off it for a month; it used to&#xD;
wear gradually off when the~weather was dry.&#xD;
'The cloak seems to have vanished,' said theLady&#xD;
Superior, when the lobby had been searched vain.&#xD;
'Oh!' cried Theresa, 'by the Virgin! this wil~&#xD;
be it; they have fun up stairs---someone is dressing~&#xD;
up ; 'if your reverence will come and see we'll find i~&#xD;

The priest Th~ughed, and followed the nun, as sh~&#xD;
led the way up stairs; but she ran so fast, that th~&#xD;
stout friar had fairly lost h~s breath before he was&#xD;

'Thg your pardon, father,' said Theresa; 'I'm so&#xD;
1 t with fasting I never touch the ground at all, at&#xD;
all.'&#xD;
The nuns were quite grave ;~ no cloak was among&#xD;
them; and they all turned out to search, but in vain~&#xD;
'A light seemed to flash upon O'llo~rau, and he&#xD;
suddenly inquired, 'Are your daughters all 'safe,&#xD;
kreverend mother? Can any one have fled in dis-&#xD;
guise?'&#xD;
The bell was rung, all ,,the nuns assembled; no&#xD;
one was missing. Miss S. and. the heretic girl were&#xD;
thew sought.; the latter was net to be found; and the&#xD;
servant nun now mentioned a priest having let him-&#xD;
self' out at the front-door.: Father O'iooran darted&#xD;
to the lodge, ~and inquired if the ~uter gate had been&#xD;
opened since he came in.&#xD;
'Only for his rever9n~ce,? replied the .~woman.&#xD;
'Whose reverence?' . inquired the ~r~est, fiercely.&#xD;
'The; sko4 father that went out in .the hull's, and&#xD;
said niver a benedicite to a poor, sinner that opened&#xD;
for him,' said 'she.&#xD;
'It was a girl in priest's clothes; how dared you&#xD;
let her out?' thundered' Father O'llo0ran, sei~i1ng&#xD;
the porteress hy ~tli~ shoulder,' and~shaking her. The&#xD;
woman shrank~back.&#xD;
~ An' ~ your rivereiice,' she said, ~ how wa~&#xD;
any~ livin' woman to ~think that there was a ~irIeen&#xD;
under a holy priest's. cloak, when Satan himself&#xD;
&#xD;
puffed out the lamp, that I couldn't see; and for tinder&#xD;
respect to his riverence, I did not keep him in the&#xD;
cowid till I lighted itV&#xD;
'You'll 4ceep a, different gate to-morrow,' cried the&#xD;
priest.&#xD;
'Aid now,' said Father Dennis,' his' sense of' the&#xD;
ludicrous' softening his anger, 'now that the girleen's&#xD;
off with"my habiliments, ihow am I to get' home in th~&#xD;
cold and the rain, barrin' the scandal of their being&#xD;
t&#xD;
found upon a woman ?"'&#xD;
'Turn it to              charity, father,' said&#xD;
the account of&#xD;
sister Theresa, 'the whole paAsh will hear of yoiu~'&#xD;
benevolence to-morrow, and praise your~ alms, to the&#xD;
honour and glory of the holy 'Catholic Ohu~ch.'&#xD;
'And who will get another cloak for mb?' aske4&#xD;
the priest: 'How am Ito get homo?'&#xD;
'Since we never go out, we have nothing where-~&#xD;
with to supply thi&amp;amp;want,' said tb~'Superioress, looking&#xD;
puzzled.&#xD;
'The night is dark,' 'said sister Theresa.. 'If the&#xD;
holy father should go home in some of our garments,&#xD;
no one will see. The reverend mother 'has warm'&#xD;
hoods; and a shawl or two may be found in the&#xD;
convent.'&#xD;
With some difficulty and much laughter, the holj&#xD;
father was arrayed in hood and shawl, and took hi~&#xD;

gleam of a4lanip fell upon the. hood.'&#xD;
'Och'! and by troth! what's this?' shouted one;&#xD;
'a runaway nun-saze her!' No sooner said . than&#xD;
done; six brawny arms were forthwith around Father&#xD;
Dannis, who struggled violently.&#xD;
'By the Y~argin! but she'\ hasn't fasted at all at&#xD;
all,' cried one; 'she's as fat as Father Dennis.'&#xD;
'Let go! you scoundrels!' cried father O'llooran,&#xD;
seizing one by the collar, and draggir~g him o11 The&#xD;
man ~vigorously used hi~ ftsts, and then a regular&#xD;
wrestling ensued; the English priest stood aloof, and&#xD;
father Dennis, rather~roughly handled, shouted, 'Irs&#xD;
never a nun I am, but your own priest, ye graceless&#xD;
gorsoons! Let me go, and ill luck to you!'&#xD;
The fellows sprang off, and making very low bows,&#xD;
one of them exclaimed, 'Bedad, ye'r riverence, it's&#xD;
niver ~ mother's son would ha' thought ov ,ye takin'&#xD;
the veil!'&#xD;
'I ax ye r           pardon,' said the 1~er;&#xD;
'but the honor an' glory o' the holy Church wash so&#xD;
strong in me, that I couldn't let a blessed nun escape&#xD;
widout bringing her back.'&#xD;
By this time father O'llooran had finished his&#xD;
conflict, having got his handsome eyes a little black-&#xD;
ened, to render him the more interesting atAhe trial&#xD;
on the morrow. Some explanations ensued, and really&#xD;
for once the priest~ ~considered it p~Aitic to tell the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
truth, and nothing but the truth; although the whole&#xD;
truth-that is, how Phemie Xee~aii got into the' con~&#xD;
vent-they did not consider it r&amp;amp;piisite to relate.&#xD;
Groat was the astonishment of father Dennis to&#xD;
find his cloak at home before him. Poor Phemie's&#xD;
conscience would not allow her to deprive the father&#xD;
of his goods; 'that would be stealing ' she said; so&#xD;
when about half-way from the nunnery, she took it&#xD;
ofi; folded it up, and, before going to Mr. MoMurphy's,&#xD;
she knocked ~at the priest's door and silently handed&#xD;
in the parcel, to the great astonishment of 'the poor&#xD;
housekeeper, who concluded that her master had been&#xD;
murdered, and forthwith raised a commotion :in t~ie&#xD;
village.&#xD;
The people were proceeding with lights to search&#xD;
for their priest, when the trio* appeared;. father&#xD;
O'llooran and the Englishman properly arrayed, aiid&#xD;
father Dennis 'in' a' nun's hood and shawl. Many,&#xD;
loud and varied were the exclamations of astonis~i-&#xD;
ment and commiseration, and not a little was the&#xD;
suppressed laughter which his appearance excited.&#xD;
With the ready wit of an Irishman, skilled in' equiv-&#xD;
ocation,' he told them he had been robbed of his gar-&#xD;
ments, and father O'Hooran added the conjecture, that&#xD;
the robber had been so plagued with evil spirits as to&#xD;
be obliged to disgorge his .booty.&#xD;
'Sacrilege is a fearful crime,' said he; 'and to rob&#xD;

itted the actions ascribed to him, he may yet be&#xD;
inced "not guilty," if those things be not&#xD;
in the eye of the church. If the evidence, in&#xD;
~se, should prove that the priests did not do the&#xD;
charged upon them, then of course the verdict&#xD;
3e" not guilty," but if the contrary seem to be&#xD;
I by successful malice, still you have it in you~'&#xD;
to return us not guilty ;-meaning not guil-&#xD;
zny crime; seeing that it is our duty to perse-&#xD;

it is merit so to do.' *&#xD;

did not impair the exercise of their duties as men&#xD;

much -i paired. The Protestants had frequently in-&#xD;
vited discussion on the articles of faith; and on the&#xD;
evening of the riot the two priests, accompanied by a&#xD;
few e bers of their flock, went to the place of meet~&#xD;
ing t accept the challenge. They found the doors&#xD;
bolted, n , on knocking, were assailed by a storm&#xD;
of abus . But at length they were admitted, when,&#xD;
upon a templ~ing to speak, they were silenced by&#xD;

for it brought her a day nearer to her imprisonment&#xD;

not possible, whether she might nt~t suddenly dive&#xD;
into the depth of a forest and elude her keepers; but&#xD;
that eye of father O'llooran-oh! it haunted her like&#xD;
some evil spirit. She felt that she was contin-&#xD;
ually under its inspection; and if for a quarter of an&#xD;
hour he was away, the I~'rench priest mounted guard,&#xD;
and the eye seemed transferred to him. The small-&#xD;

* 'Fathers,' said sister Theresa, to the priests, 'we&#xD;

'What r&amp;amp;~reation do you wish?' inquhed the&#xD;

'To see the beauties of Genoa. We could not be&#xD;

to yalk by the waves before being shut up for ever.&#xD;
It seemed to renew the days of her childhood, and&#xD;
she stood gazing fixedly upon the long, pale-blue&#xD;
waves rolling slowly in, their crests broken into snowy&#xD;
foam upon the smooth sand ; the &amp;amp;xquisite shading of&#xD;
blue and white and sand colour ; the fresh, yet gen-&#xD;
tle breeze; the pure soft sky ;. the line of green be-&#xD;
hind the beach, and farther back, the noble forms of&#xD;
the Appenines, combined to weave a spell almost&#xD;
overpowering to the heart of the long-imprisoned&#xD;
nun. She was not permitted to remain long ; the&#xD;
priests had busines in Genoa; and the girls were to be&#xD;
shut up again till it was transacted. They were taken&#xD;
to the convent of St. , and indulged by the&#xD;
abbess with sauntering in. the spacious garden kept&#xD;
in order by the nuns. .Here were fountains, orange-&#xD;
trees, and all manner of paradisaical things ; and if&#xD;
nature could have made her adorers happy, sister&#xD;
Agnes had been happy that day. She reclined be-&#xD;
side a fountain under a shade of myrtles and orange-&#xD;
trees ;-adyet she wept.&#xD;
.Sister Theresa chatted merrily with the French&#xD;
nun who accompanied them. She was unacquainted&#xD;
with Italian, and therefore could converse with none&#xD;
of the sisters of the convent. The superioress alone&#xD;
spoke French.&#xD;
Next day they set off for Florence, through a&#xD;
magnificent country. Ascending a steep road that&#xD;

skirts the bay, they enjoyed the prospect of the vast&#xD;
expanse of sea on the one hand, and of hills on 'the&#xD;
other, hills at whose feet, and along whose sides,&#xD;
were scattered villas, and vineyards, and orchards.&#xD;
~All the way to Florence it was one continued luxury ;&#xD;
and the environs of that city, different as it is from&#xD;
Genoa, presented new-beauties to their eyes. Stand-&#xD;
ing iran extensive and luxuriant plain, girdled by the&#xD;
Appe iines,. adorned with noble architecture-with&#xD;

' Is it in Florence we are to live 3' she inquired.&#xD;
'No, my daughter, not 'in a town. Important&#xD;
business brought us hither, but your home is further&#xD;
north, where the scenery' is still more romantic, and&#xD;
the air more healthful. ~We shall remaain in Florence&#xD;

Very magnificent was the exterior of the convent;&#xD;
very dismal and horribly filthy was its interior,&#xD;
Many of the nuns were vowed to perpetual silence,&#xD;
and they moved bout like spectres. 'They were&#xD;
clothed in filthy rags. The establishment was one&#xD;
of the strictest of the clausura. No voice of father&#xD;
or mother, sister or friend, ever broke upon the&#xD;
deathlike. solitude, except once a year when some of&#xD;

from the other side of a strong double grating -a few&#xD;
words from their relatives. 'My daughters, shun the&#xD;
parlatory-as you would shun the mouth of hell,' was&#xD;
the 'exhortation of the' confessor. Enfeebled by fast-&#xD;
ing, wounded by stripes, stupified by silence, the&#xD;
nuns of this convent looked scarcely like human beings,&#xD;
and the olfactory nerves of poor sister Agnes rebel-&#xD;
led sadly~againt the odours of this " most sanctified'"&#xD;
place. If the object of sanctification were t1ie utter&#xD;
degradation of the human species, it had been truly&#xD;
attained here.&#xD;
'Alas ! sister,' she said to Theresa, ' What if our&#xD;
convent should be like this ? we cannot exist.'&#xD;
' We need not,' replied the sister with an expres-&#xD;
sion of countenance that terrified the gentler nun.&#xD;
'It may be like that at G3enoa.'&#xD;
~ It may--I care little.'&#xD;
The meal that day was of black bread, grapes,&#xD;
-and sour wine ; in the morning they had bread and.&#xD;
water. Some of the nuns ate their bread sprinkled&#xD;
with ashes, others had their cup of water soiled. The&#xD;
silence at meals was unbroken, save by the tread of&#xD;
the sisters who waited upon the rest. Not even a&#xD;
legend of a saint was read at meals. The convent&#xD;
was seldom swept; the clothes of the sisters were&#xD;
never washed ; the garden was uncultivated ; so the&#xD;
nuns had nothing to do. They sat in listless indo-&#xD;
lence, or performed stations on bare knees, or flagel-&#xD;

lated themselves or others, or kneelen1 before a pic-&#xD;

more than one bespoke her an idiot ; the wild snatches&#xD;
of song that proceeded from another, as she passed&#xD;
unheeded to and fro, told that she was. a maniac.&#xD;
Agnes wondered how any one could retain reason for&#xD;
a twelvemonth there. Sister Theresa had managed&#xD;
to gain the intelligence that one third of the nuns&#xD;
died mad ; that few of them lived more than five&#xD;
years.&#xD;
Sister Agnes was horror-stricken!&#xD;
-' The abbess is a wonderful saint,' said father&#xD;
O'llooran, when he had resumed his charge, and they&#xD;
proceeded northward, ' Her nuns usually die in the&#xD;
odour of sanctity ; itais not uncommon for angels to&#xD;
be seen hovering over their beds, ready to carry their&#xD;
souls to heaven. It is av blessed place-the convent&#xD;

A LIVING SAINT.&#xD;

"Will deal in outward rites and specious forms,&#xD;
'KReligion satisfied: truth shall retire."  M1LT0~.&#xD;
THE spirits of sister Agnes had been miserably de&#xD;
pressed ever since she had received the intelligence&#xD;
of her father's death. The beauties of nature, through&#xD;
which she had passed, had exercised a tranquillizin~&#xD;
~though not an elevating effect upon her mind; bui&#xD;
the gloomy fanaticism of this convent sank her agair&#xD;
into the depths of despondency. These cadaverous&#xD;
women, hunger-bitten~ diseased, filthy, with county*&#xD;
nuances indicative of continual pain, she was told were&#xD;
great saints, and she trembled at the portals of thai&#xD;
saintship which she had been so~eager to have opened&#xD;
for herself. Purgatory could be. scarcely worse, she&#xD;
thought, ~than so sad an* existence in this world; and&#xD;
in her recoil she had almost said, "Let us eat and&#xD;
drink, for to-morrow we die."&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
There is but a step from fanaticism to epicureaw&#xD;
ism,~ just as there is a very slight division between the.&#xD;
credulity that accepts all things and the infidelity that&#xD;
believes nothing.&#xD;
She remembered Genoa~, and the luxu6ous rooms&#xD;
of the priest's house in London, andi she became puz~&#xD;
zied with her reflections.&#xD;
One of the sisters of this convent had features so&#xD;
exquisitel~chiselled, that in youth and health she&#xD;
must have been beautiful; but this sister had only&#xD;
one eye; and the one side of her face contrasted&#xD;
strongly with the other. Agnes was told that saint&#xD;
Helena,-.--all the sisters here were denominated&#xD;
'Saint,'-had been r~rnarkable for her loveliness; but&#xD;
finding it a snare, and wiwilling to be distinguished&#xD;
by any thing but her humility, she had, by the advice&#xD;
of her confessor, submitted to have her right eye burxi~&#xD;
ed out. When the abbess had finished the recital of&#xD;
this story to sister Agnes, she proceeded to speak of&#xD;
St. Rose of Lima, a virgin who, by austerities un-&#xD;
sparingly practiced, attained to sublime heights of&#xD;
sanctity. * 'Even from the cradle she shone with~the&#xD;
presages of future holiness; her face being wondrous-&#xD;
ly transfigured into the image of a rose, caused h~r&#xD;
to b~ called by this name, to which the Mother of&#xD;

describably chill, being underground. The abbess&#xD;
struck a light, and desired the nun to follow her.&#xD;
Agnes trembled; she apprehended some trap for&#xD;
4         herself; but not daring to speak, she went forward&#xD;
k&#xD;
after the abbess. They entered a cell dark as mid~&#xD;

a foul, damp* odour filled the place.~ A coffin was&#xD;
on the ground, and in it, amids't ashes, lay the sem-&#xD;
blance of a human being, attenuated and filthy to&#xD;

They often left their carriage to walk; ~and the spell&#xD;
of nature again was wound around 'the heart of the&#xD;
young enthusiast who had renounced it. Yineyards&#xD;
clothed the lower parts of the mountains in many&#xD;
places; and stretching far up towards the deep blue&#xD;
sky, pine-forests towered on the heights. They halted&#xD;
for a meal beside a rivulet that came tickling down&#xD;
a hill, and they drank of the sparkling water. A&#xD;
black wooden cross was erected by.its side, and they&#xD;
prostrated themselves before it. Their conductor.&#xD;
told them that a man had been murdered there by a&#xD;
bandit, who, after paying largely to the Church, and&#xD;
receiving absolution, erected the cross in memory of&#xD;
his fault. 'Ah! 'tis good to be a bandit, and gain&#xD;
money,' said the conductor, 'money procures all things&#xD;
-bread, grapes, and salvation.'&#xD;
'Dishones% gains need to be atoned for,' said father&#xD;
O'llooran.&#xD;
'Ah! they atone for themselves,' rejoined the man.&#xD;
'Divide them with the church, and the one half sauc-&#xD;
tifies the other. It is easier to get absolution for mur~&#xD;
der and robbery, than for eating mutton on Friday.'&#xD;
A week or two afterwards, the conductor was&#xD;
snatched from his family and thrown~into a Tuscan&#xD;
dungeon, for blaspheming the church.&#xD;
To the great satisfaction of sister Agnes, it was&#xD;
necessary to discard the carriage, and alternately to&#xD;

nothing to obstruct the view of the magnificent s&#xD;

cbthed Appenines; varied beauties lay all around;&#xD;
groups of chestnut trees; green pastures on which&#xD;
cattle and sheep were browsing; ~easant~' huts, and&#xD;
elegant villas. Agnes looked on with melancholy&#xD;
pleasure. 'Beautiful,' she said to herself 'beautiful;&#xD;
buttl shall be shut out from nature"-s~1~i in among&#xD;
the walls, and perchance the dungeons~ there.'&#xD;
I have been told,' said father O'llooran, as if he&#xD;
had read her thoughts, ' that the gardens are lovely,&#xD;
and the walls are oVertopped by those grand moun-&#xD;
tains. You will find that convent a beautiful and&#xD;
peaceful home, my daughters~'&#xD;
Sister Theresa looked fixedly upon the? counte-&#xD;
nance of sister Agnes, into whose eyes tears were&#xD;
springing.&#xD;
There was a bi~idge further down the river; but&#xD;
a little skiff waited for the party, and they crossed&#xD;
directly opposite to the convent. A smooth lawn ex-&#xD;
tended to the edge of the water; a high ~and exten-&#xD;
sive wall ran along the bank, and in the centre, a&#xD;
noble gateway reared its massive columns. The bell&#xD;
was rung, and an ancient porter opened, admitted&#xD;
the party, and closed again the thick' iron-studded&#xD;
doors.&#xD;
'In prison again!' was the mental exclamation of&#xD;
sister Agnes.. Yet the prison was a noble one. The'&#xD;
monastery of the monks occupied one side aiid the&#xD;

down the court. Like the generality of Tuscan villa&#xD;
the lower story of the convent was arched, and my&#xD;
tles, and orange-trees, and flowering shrubs, gre&#xD;
here and there against it. The nuns were conduct&#xD;
to their own quarter, while the priests were receive&#xD;
by the Abbot on the~ opposite side.&#xD;
Sister Agnes felt a little relieved when the do&#xD;
opened ~nd she was uslieied into a spacious ha&#xD;
arched and cool, and hung. round~ with pictures.&#xD;
vwas clean too, and she ventured to hope that som&#xD;
thing of. comfort might be found there.&#xD;
The abbess appeared-a little sprightly Italia&#xD;
with regular features, and sparkling eyes% The ho&#xD;
was tastefully arranged, and ~somewhat of a coqueti&#xD;
afr pervaded her monastic dress. ~She saluted ea&#xD;
of the nuns with a kiss upon the cheek, conduct~&#xD;
them to her own room, and set before them fru~&#xD;
bread, and wine.&#xD;
'Yo~i are. weary, my daughters,' she said, 'e:&#xD;
and refresh yourselves.'&#xD;
The sisters rested till the vesper-bell summon&#xD;
them to the -chapel. It was very, splendid, and ti&#xD;
music very fine. A number of the 'friars 'atten'&#xD;

with Rome, has. taken the place of F' worship in spirit&#xD;
and in truth." Dead lope has an easy resurrection;&#xD;
she readily 'revives when called; and this evening&#xD;
she opened her eyes and languidly raised her head&#xD;
while sister Agnes listened to the rich Italian music,&#xD;
and gazed upon the noble architecture around her.&#xD;
She whispered, but her whisper was faint-that&#xD;
peace and holiness might after all be found on earth.&#xD;
We shall see how long the echo of that 'i~hisper&#xD;
lasted.&#xD;
- On the following morning the new residents were&#xD;
taken to see the beauties of the monastery; for the&#xD;
abbess was very proud ofNier domains. They in-&#xD;

cloisters, along with some statuary and- other treas~&#xD;
ures which adorned them. Many of the pictures&#xD;
were really excellent-some by the bes1~ old masters.&#xD;
A Madonna by Guido, especially attracted the atten-&#xD;
tion of sister Agnes, for she was a. devoted idolater&#xD;
of the Virgin. Some precious' relics too were kept&#xD;
in silver shrines; one of the many thousand nails of&#xD;
the true cross; a fragment of the Virgin's petticoat;&#xD;
bones of two or three saints; a bottle of martyr's&#xD;
blood; and a few hairs plucked from the garment of&#xD;
St. John the Baptist. These were most reverently&#xD;
exhIbited.. There was a fine sacristy also, designed&#xD;
by some eminent architect; and an edifying array of&#xD;

cross bones and skulls. The nun's garden was truly&#xD;
beautiful, according to the Italian style' of gardening.&#xD;
There was a fountain in a~ myrtle-shade, surrounded&#xD;
by rich velvet turf; which especially delighted our&#xD;
heroine; the flower parterres ~were very rich. A&#xD;
little rivulet murmured through the midst, and es-&#xD;
caped through a grating under the wall to join 'the&#xD;
river, the banks were of turf mingled with flowers,&#xD;
and orange-trees; and here and there a chestnut&#xD;
drooped' 'its branches to kiss the water. If sister&#xD;
Agnes had not known that human passion can trans~&#xD;
form paradise into pandemonium, she would have&#xD;
dreamed of paradise here. But she now knew what&#xD;
it is to be a prisoner, and she had discovered that&#xD;
something in her own heart which ever disturbs&#xD;
repose; and therefore her pleasure was mixed with&#xD;
sadness~ '&#xD;
*1&#xD;
She was surprised by the announcement. that a&#xD;
play was to be performed in the evening by several&#xD;
of the sisterer and that the Abbot, the confessors,&#xD;
and. other dignitaries of the monastery, would witness&#xD;
its performance. There was ~ bustle of preparation.&#xD;
Dresses-not convent-dresses, gentle reader, but&#xD;
such as you see' on the stage-well arranged; the&#xD;
theatre-a large room, temporarily appropriated to&#xD;
the purpose, was prepared and adorned, and' the corps&#xD;
dramatique was oc~cu~ied in rehearsal.*&#xD;

surprised sister Agnes than this evening's amuse-&#xD;
ment. The play was well performed ; the priest~ ap-&#xD;
plauded vehemently, and remained to supper with&#xD;
the nuns.&#xD;
When sister Agnes retired to her cell, she pon-&#xD;
dered wonderingly upon her varied experience of&#xD;
convent life-the vulgar Irish establishment, the&#xD;
luxurious 0-enoese; the wretched Florentine; and&#xD;
now this scene of beauty and gaiety; and ever and&#xD;

IN a day or two Father O'Hooran took his leave&#xD;
after having recommended to the two nuns under hi~&#xD;

"You desire holiness, my daughter,' he said to sis&#xD;

know the dept1~ of villainy, which lurked under the&#xD;
polished and dignified exterior of the priest; for with&#xD;
his acute perception of' character, he had soon disco-&#xD;
vered, that with sister Agnes he must be a sair~t, if&#xD;
he would maintain influence over her; and tha1~ the&#xD;
infliction of a little painful disci~1ine would but&#xD;
strengthen his ascendancy. FLe easily perceived th~t&#xD;
many of the monks of~t. Helena were very irreligious;&#xD;
and he was glad to find a few young men of a differ~-&#xD;
ent character: one-a priest, he perceived to. be just&#xD;
the sort of person suitable to direct the conscience of&#xD;
sister Agnes. Not that he cared about conscience;&#xD;
he had none himself; but it is one of the instruments&#xD;
for making fast the chains of the Church, and, as such,&#xD;
requires to be judiciously handled. Sisters Agnes&#xD;
and Theresa were therefore introduced to~ father Fran-&#xD;
cesco; the French nun found a confessor of a differ-&#xD;
ent stamp.*&#xD;
Father Fran~,esco~was about thirty years of ~,ge,&#xD;
of a handsome but pensive Italian countenance, and&#xD;
the gentle bearing of nobility. HighTy intellectual,&#xD;
his mind often rebelled against ~the absurdities or his&#xD;
faith, but with many a penance he had striven to check&#xD;
this deadly sin; and as often as reason asserted her&#xD;
sway, so often had he resolutely chained her down.&#xD;
He was constitutionally devout; his nature impelled&#xD;

him to worship, and, unconscious of the true object of&#xD;
adoration, he bowed before the god~ which Rome ha~&#xD;
exalted; and if the qualities which she ascribes to&#xD;
them sometimes failed to awaken his veneration, he&#xD;
clothed them with others created by his own fancy.&#xD;
He dwelt among the romances of the past-the annals&#xD;
of martyrdom, and miracles, and transcendentalism;&#xD;
and he panted to emulate the Christian heroes of an-&#xD;
tiquity, who foiled demons in the desert; or the mis-&#xD;
sionaries of more modern times, the Loyolas and Xa-&#xD;
viers of world-wide fame.&#xD;
Unlike his associates, he was not satisfied with&#xD;
bodily service. It was the mind which he sought to&#xD;
discipline through the sufferings of the body, and it&#xD;
was sin that he sought to subdue. For this purpose,&#xD;
though not a Jesuit, he ardently followed the course&#xD;
of meditation prescribed by lLoyola, and had really at-&#xD;
tained to some height of what he considered spirituality.&#xD;
He loved nature: her beauties in his own romantic&#xD;
land sent a thrill of joy through his heart; and he&#xD;
peopled her solitudes with saints and angels, and made&#xD;
them vocal with Ayes and Paternosters. It will be&#xD;
perceived that his character bore a considerable i'e-&#xD;
semblance to that of sister Agnes; his desires and&#xD;
'aspirations were the same as hers; but he had the&#xD;
vigour which springs from comparative liberty; while&#xD;
she had the languor and depression which fasten upon&#xD;
the slave. Father Francesco could refresh his spirit&#xD;

&#xD;
with the beauties, and his frame with the breezes, of&#xD;
his much-loved Nature; sister Agnes pined for this,&#xD;
but pined in vain. The benevolence too, and human&#xD;
sympathy of the monk could find a sphere of action&#xD;
among the poor and the miserable; and this kept his&#xD;
heart alive: while the nun, sighing for affection and&#xD;
communion, dwelt apart in enforced loneliness and&#xD;
uselessness, and in bitter solitude of spirit. She was&#xD;
about to find a mind like her own-a mind to hold&#xD;
communion with hers: but, alas! it was but to in-&#xD;
crease her misery.&#xD;
The account given by father O'llooran to the con-&#xD;
fessor of his new penitent greatly interested him.&#xD;
The establishment was a large one. There were&#xD;
the abbess; a vicar or assistant; a mistress of the&#xD;
novices-for here the novices were not permitted to&#xD;
have intercourse with the nuns, a very politic regula-&#xD;
tion~-a bursar, sacristan, fortress, infirmarian, keeper&#xD;
of relics, &amp;amp;c. The nuns at this time were twenty-five,&#xD;
the novices six.&#xD;
A few of the religious formed almost a separate&#xD;
community; they were thoBe who desired to become&#xD;
saints. According to the directions of St. Liguori,&#xD;
they abstained from the opera, never indulged in the&#xD;
parlatory, ate very sparingly, and often fasted entirely;&#xD;

i~isited, except for confession; scoured themselves&#xD;

&#xD;
and disgusting offices from which others were glad to&#xD;
escape; entirely avoided the bath; and preserved an&#xD;
almost continual silence. There were four who ob-&#xD;
served these rules in all their strictness.&#xD;
For a few days all went on si~oothly; the three&#xD;
sisters freshly arrived, were initiated into the ways of&#xD;
the monastery, had their work assigned them, and fell&#xD;
into the routine of life there. But sister Theresa's&#xD;
liveliness attracted the attention of some French&#xD;
brethren, with whom she could converse; their visits&#xD;
became too frequent, and the abbess frowned; in fact&#xD;
she used herself to hold a little harmless ftirtation*&#xD;
with one' of them, and she felt jealous of the new nun.&#xD;
With Italian vindictiveness she resolved to punish&#xD;
her, and sentenced her to be confined to her cell for a&#xD;
fortnight upon bread and water. She likewise told&#xD;
Sister Agnes that the instructions of an abbess were&#xD;
positive, to permit no peculiar friendships among the&#xD;
religious; that she perceived a dangerous attachment&#xD;
to have sprung up between her and sister Theresa,&#xD;
and therefore she must interdict them from speaking&#xD;
to each other~at all for a month; and after that, from&#xD;
ever conversing longer than five minutes in one day.&#xD;
Sister Agnes bitterly felt this privation, but she sub-&#xD;

emitted quietly. When not employed, she used. to go&#xD;
to the garden to enjoy its beauties; but a dreadful&#xD;
solitude of heart oppressed her. At these times her&#xD;
father's image haunted her, ~nd her distress was ag-&#xD;
gravated by her utter ignorance of all the circum-&#xD;
stances of his death. Nothing but the fact itself had&#xD;
been vouchsafed her. During her travels her mind&#xD;
had been sufficiently occupied to keep it comparative-&#xD;
ly calm, but now it preyed upon its own imaginings.&#xD;
She went to confession, and discovered that father&#xD;
Francesco understood all her feelings. He soothed&#xD;
j~er; appointed some religious exercises appropriate&#xD;
to her case, and enjoined frequent prayer to the Ma-&#xD;
donna, and meditation upon her merits. Very gently&#xD;
he spoke of her father, and enjoined hei~ to feel con-&#xD;
vinced of the salutary nature of the discipline by&#xD;
which she was kept in ignorance of the circumstances&#xD;
of his death. He would not permit her to reproach&#xD;
herself with being the cause of it. The act of devot-&#xD;
ing herself to a religious life was a right act, he said,&#xD;
and she was not answerable for the consequences.&#xD;
Alas! by what precept of the divine law did he find&#xD;
that act to be right'? The truth is, a doubt arose in&#xD;
his mind even while he spoke; but that doubt was&#xD;
smothered, for the Church had given forth her in-&#xD;
fallible decree.&#xD;
Never had Sister Agnes been so tranquilized by&#xD;
confession. It was not long before she returned.&#xD;

Stunned, desQlated, sister Agnes retired to her&#xD;

set it free he must break them all. In one moment&#xD;
what~ agon had seized her! She oQuld not think&#xD;

pray; but n6 prayer would come from her parched&#xD;
lips ;-des air, utter, intolerable despair had seized&#xD;
her.&#xD;
At len th thought came. She was for ever sep-&#xD;
arated fro her only friend. It was too true; he was&#xD;
indeed the light of her existence; and this must be&#xD;
what is cal ed love. Why had she not suspeet~d it&#xD;

every thou ht, every feeling of h~eNr souls She feared&#xD;
she had &amp;amp; ned mortally-she who had vowed to be&#xD;
the bride f Ohrist alone. For the first time she&#xD;
realized th terrible nature of that vow; it had shut&#xD;
her out fro joy, from hope for ever: it had consigned&#xD;
her to des air. Others. might love and' be happy;&#xD;
she had by d, but t~o be wretched. Whatwas life to&#xD;
her now? A dreary, desolate. existence. Her fever-&#xD;

&#xD;
took their $aces; and when the service commenced,&#xD;
the scene t6 a stranger would have been imposing.&#xD;
The magnificent architecture, the gorgeous altar-piece&#xD;
-the work of Titian-the images of saints, the dark,&#xD;
kneeling figures of the sisters, their sudden rising, and&#xD;
the bursting forth of the rich peal of music, formed a&#xD;
spell not easy to be resisted by the young and en-&#xD;
thusiastic. Yet to many of the nuns themselves this&#xD;
daily routine was wearisome and monotonous; and&#xD;
this morning many thoughts were wandering to some-&#xD;
thing which was to break the tedious dulness of their&#xD;
existence-a gorgeous ceremonial awaiting them.&#xD;
Matins finished, a few lingered behind in the&#xD;
chapel, telling their beads; some went to the garden&#xD;
to gather flowers, and others proceeded to the con-&#xD;
fection-room to finish the preparation of some of those&#xD;
beautiful preserves for which Italian convents are re~&#xD;
markable, and which, by the bye, are like the lives&#xD;
of their niakers, bright and tempting to the eye, but&#xD;
insipid in their cloying sweetness to the taste. The&#xD;
glittering frost-work sparkled upon the almost tran&#xD;
parent fruits, and the triumph of their art was com-&#xD;
plete.&#xD;
Our English nun, with one or two companions,&#xD;
walked slowly to the garden.&#xD;
'We are allowed to speak this morning,' said she.&#xD;
'How I love thQse white roses, and orange-flowers,&#xD;
and that blue peaceful sky, and the high tops of those&#xD;
&#xD;

meal of black head and grapes and water, during&#xD;
which not a -word was-spoken. When they had left&#xD;
the refectory-' You are to dress my hair, dear&#xD;

take the veil, 'dress it like an English lady's.'&#xD;
Agnes threw her ar~is round the neck of the love-&#xD;

bosom, but one word of pity she dared- not speak.&#xD;
'Have yoi not been happy since you became the&#xD;

Very happy,' was the reply, th~ words of which&#xD;

were contradicted by the:tone.&#xD;

grating. He fancied that her eye was fixed upon&#xD;
him, and as he scrutinized her countenance, so sad,   4&#xD;
yet so sweet, a strange feeling passed over his heart,&#xD;
and his eyes became riveted upon her.&#xD;
Reader, have you ever seen, in the features of an&#xD;
unknown person, something that touched a chord in&#xD;
your spirit for which you could not account? You&#xD;
could not detect a resemblance to any one you loved,&#xD;
but a thrill as of some old affection passed through&#xD;
your inmost soul, and you could not but gaze. So&#xD;
felt Colonel Hayward; so was he attracted to watch&#xD;
the nun, while she stood immoveable as a statue,&#xD;
with her races turned towaris him. He became al..&#xD;
most unconscious of the service, and forgetful of his&#xD;
sympathy with' the heroine of the day.&#xD;
At length theloud burst of the hallelujah chorus&#xD;
awakened him from his trance. All wa~ over, and&#xD;
the new. recluse was about to be lost to the world for&#xD;
ever. A basket of fresh flowers was handed to her,&#xD;
and she advanced to the* grating to distribute them&#xD;
to the bystanders. Colonel Hayward pressed for~&#xD;
ward among the rest, to receive a flowered from the&#xD;
fair but trembling hand; but, when he approached&#xD;
the 'grating, the nun he had been watching 'rushed&#xD;
forward to it; throwing up her arn~s, and dashing&#xD;
them against the bars, she screamed wildly, 'Uncle,&#xD;
save me!' In vain she clung to the grating; in a&#xD;
moment she was drawn back, and the curtain fell;&#xD;

The horrible torture took effect; but it defeated&#xD;

desperation of her fruitless struggling choked h&#xD;
Her face~became black; her convulsive moveme&#xD;
ceased; sister Agnes was dead.&#xD;
'There is no more resistance,' said the strong m&#xD;
who had been holding her down.&#xD;
The judge approached, stooped down, and exa&#xD;
med the body, while the sisters held their breath.&#xD;
'The Virgin has avenged herself;' said the hy&#xD;
crite. 'Take her away.!&#xD;

Fearfully the nuns retired, each to her cell, ti&#xD;
matins. They had lookedupon murder before; bu&#xD;
the strange bearing and strajiger words, of siste&#xD;
Agnes, had made an unwanted impression upon thei&#xD;
~minds; for usually the mode of destroying one wh&#xD;
&#xD;
was to be made away with, was by poison or opium.&#xD;
Even those who slept started wildly from frightful&#xD;
dreams. Circlets of glory, purgatorial fires, strange&#xD;
characters traced by fiends upon the walls, and gloomy&#xD;
chambers of torture, mingled in their visions.&#xD;
As for the Abbot, the summons haunted him, 'and&#xD;
deep were his potations to drown the dreadful words.&#xD;
'Am I a poltroon, to believe in purgatory P he in-&#xD;
wardly inquired.~ 'That girl's existence is quenched&#xD;

will be warm enough when the lime is over you, yo g&#xD;

fortified himself for~his religious duties, and then sang&#xD;
matins with most ~difying devotion.&#xD;

of the doomed nur~ arose again before him, and her&#xD;
still wilder words rang in his ears.&#xD;

TRUE to his appointment, Edward went next ni&#xD;
with all needful implements for forcing the pri~&#xD;
bars. lb was accompanied by a young man wh&#xD;
acquaintance he had made in hunting, who had&#xD;
been a bandit on the mountains, and who now liv&#xD;
by the chase.- Bold and lawless enough for any&#xD;
venture, hating the government and the priestho&#xD;
he was ever ready to do them a disservice, and&#xD;
heart having been won towards~ jEdward by witnessiij&#xD;
an act of singular courage in despatching a wil&#xD;
boar, he was easily induced to assist in the project&#xD;
delivering the captive nun.&#xD;
'Saint Benedict send out the Abbot himself upo&#xD;
i~s,' exclaimed the bandi~t., 'He would be as fat&#xD;
prey as that old tucker you finished so gallantly.'&#xD;
'Ak! eomrade! but it i~ 'not sport we want t&#xD;

night, it is serious work-no shooting of an abbot-&#xD;
but to bring this young lady out of his clutches !&#xD;
'For this night I am your servant. I will forget&#xD;
that there is sport in the worlds This signora sl~al1&#xD;
be yours ere morning dawns, and I will conceal you&#xD;
where neither priest nor shirro shall dare to come&#xD;
till you can embark for England.'&#xD;
'Grazie, mio Amico!'&#xD;
Their first act was, of course, to speak through&#xD;
the bars of the grating. There was no response9&#xD;
Again and again as disti~ictly i~s he dared, Edward&#xD;
pronounced the name of Mary, but Mary re~Aied not,&#xD;
and he turned to hi~ companion in a tumult of dread&#xD;
forebodings. Amico,' said the bandit, 'your design&#xD;
'Ah!&#xD;
has been discovered. The signora is placed beyond&#xD;
your reach. The holy mother defend her! You&#xD;
must have been observed.'&#xD;
'speak, Mary!' cried the young man through&#xD;
the iron .grating.&#xD;
There was no answer.&#xD;
'Cousin Mary, you are safe all things are pre~&#xD;
pared for flight-only speak!' still not a voice&#xD;
responded.&#xD;
'I must see, at least,' said Edward, taking up a&#xD;
file and beginning to 'work at the grating. The&#xD;
bandit wrought on the other side .9f the bar, and then&#xD;
the crowbar was applied to the weakened iron. It.&#xD;

the lantern was lowered to the floor, and they enter d.&#xD;
'Demons is this a place for a high-born Engli~sh&#xD;

and odour.&#xD;
'Mary, cousin Mary, speak if you are ali e.&#xD;
Can she have been murdered?' e inquired, turni~ig&#xD;

'It is possible,' returned the bandit, 'but if so,&#xD;
her body will surely be fouiid he e.' Strangely e -&#xD;

bandit. 'Could.not you have fainted where our IiVe~&#xD;

19w his guide to the grating. They had just emerged2&#xD;
when a hoarse voice commanded them to stop and a&#xD;
pistol was fired, without however taking effect. Thd&#xD;
bandit returned the salute in an equally harmless&#xD;
manner, when the assaulting party fled towards the&#xD;
convent, and Edward and the bandit retreated as&#xD;
speedily as possible.&#xD;
Much as he needed hospitality, Edward could not&#xD;
return to Count Guarducci; and he was in no mood&#xD;
to encounter the prying of the peasant with~ whom he&#xD;
had taken up. his quarters on the previous night.&#xD;
He stretched himself upon the dried grass beneath&#xD;
the pure Italian sky,~ to rest, but ~not to sleep. We&#xD;
need not picture his feverish tossing, his wild ima-&#xD;
ginings, his horrified remembrances of the burial..&#xD;
vault. That the white hand and arm beloi~ged to his&#xD;
murdered cousin, he doubted not, and his aim now was&#xD;
to pass on by the assistance of the bandit to Florence,&#xD;
to obtain a passport, and set out for England-hav.&#xD;
ing first written to acquaint Colonel Hayward with&#xD;
the sad and fruitless issue of his adventure. The&#xD;
bandit was faithful, and he liberally rewarded him.&#xD;
Immediately upon the reception ofiiis son's letter&#xD;
Colonel Hayward set out also for V1orence,~ and sooii&#xD;
joined his son. He had on the ~day appointed by~th~&#xD;

attracted his attention, was the daughterr of an Eng-&#xD;

until she had become unfit for society-that she had&#xD;
been placed in ~he convent as a secure and calm re-&#xD;

initted to4ake part in religious ceremonies-that she&#xD;
still believed Colonel Hayward t be a relative, and&#xD;
~that the excitement .of the inorni g had thrown her&#xD;
into 'a dangerous illness. It w s quite impossible&#xD;
that' Colonel Hayward should see her; and the&#xD;
Colonel chafing with rage, but nable to make out&#xD;
any ease for the interference of onsul, ambassador,&#xD;

The strange story was told in England, wondered&#xD;
at,4whispered about, sneered at, magnified, doubted,&#xD;
derided, gossiped over in old ladies' tea-parties, re~&#xD;
lated on Protestant platforms, and finally discarded as&#xD;
totally wanting in the elemer~ts of credibility. The&#xD;
corpse that would have proved its truth was con-&#xD;

WHERE startling statements have been made they&#xD;
will be shown to be quite consistent with the author-&#xD;
ized tenets of the Romish Church. In' doijig so, it&#xD;
will he requisite frequently to quote from the wriP&#xD;
ings of St. Alfonso Liguori. These have been by&#xD;
that Church stamped with infallibility. In 1803, the&#xD;
Sacred 'Congregation of Rites decreed, that "In&#xD;
all the writings of Alfonso IAguori, edited an~&#xD;
unedited, there was not one word that couldjustlyb~&#xD;
found fault with." Four days afterwards Pope Piu~&#xD;
VII, solemnly approved and ratified the decree.&#xD;
On 5th June, ,1831, another decree of'the Sacred&#xD;
Chamber confirmed the former; and in 1839, Li~uori&#xD;
was canonized.&#xD;
The extracts here given 'from the writings of the&#xD;
latest saint of the Holy Church will be found to b~&#xD;
authentic, although the author of this volume has not&#xD;
personally drawn the gems from that mine of morality.&#xD;

be deported to a Pbpish country, where no law can&#xD;

The correspondent in Rome of the Daily News,&#xD;
London journal, while avowing himself a Roman&#xD;
Catholic, thus wrote from that city, March 31,&#xD;
1849,-&#xD;
"1 ~visited this morning the works going on in&#xD;
the subterranean vaults of the Holy Office, and~ was&#xD;
not a little horrified at what I saw with my own eyes,&#xD;
and held in my. own hands. Though I have been&#xD;
familiar with everything in and about Rome for a&#xD;
quarter of a century, I confess I never had any curi-&#xD;
osity to visit the Inquisition, taking it for granted&#xD;
that everything was carried on there fairly and&#xD;
honestly, as I was led to believe by people worthy in&#xD;
other respects of implicit trust. Be0ides, the place&#xD;
itself is out of the beaten track of all strangers, and&#xD;

in a sort of cul-de~,ac behind S . Peter's, where it&#xD;
naturally retired to perform its blushing operations,&#xD;
and 'd~ 'good by stealth.' I was struck with the out-&#xD;
ward appearance of civilization and comfort displayed&#xD;
by the building, which owes its erection to&#xD;
author of the last creed; but on&#xD;
character 'of the concern was no entering, the real&#xD;
longer dissimulated.&#xD;
A range of Strongly-barred prisons formed the&#xD;
ground-floor of a quadrangular court, and these dark&#xD;
and damp receptacles I found Were only the prelimi-&#xD;
n~ry stage of probation, intended for new-comers, as&#xD;
yet uninitiated into the Eleusinian mysteries of the&#xD;
establishment. Euitering a passage to the left, you&#xD;
arrive at a smaller courtyard, where a triple row of&#xD;
smalbbarred dungeons rise from the soil upwards,&#xD;
SomeWhat after the outward look of ~t, three-decker&#xD;
accommodating' about sixty prisoners. These&#xD;
barred cages must have been often fully manned, for~&#xD;
there is a sup eme ry w constructed at ~the back&#xD;
of the qua angle on the ground-floor, which faces a&#xD;
large gaa' en. All these cellular contrivances have&#xD;
strong ir rings let into the masonry, and in some&#xD;
there is large stone firmly imbedded in the centre&#xD;
with asi lar massive ring. Numerous inscriptions,&#xD;
dated centuries back, are dimly legible Qn the admis-&#xD;
sion of light, the general tenor being assertion of&#xD;
inuoeenee: 'Iddjo~ ci ?iber~ di lin~rua calurn,~iatrice'&#xD;

atores mendaces exterminabuntur.' I read another&#xD;
somewhat longer, the drift of which is, 'The caprice&#xD;
or wickedness of man can't exclude me from thy&#xD;
Church, 0 Christ, my only hope.' The officer in&#xD;
charge led me down to where the men were digging in&#xD;
the vaults below; they had cleared a downward flight&#xD;
of steps, which was choke~I up~ with old rubbish, and&#xD;
had come to a series of dungeons under the vaults&#xD;
deeper still, and which immediately brought to my&#xD;
mind the prisons of the Doge under the canal of the&#xD;
Bridge of Sighs at Venice, only that here there was&#xD;
a surpassing horror. I saw imbedded in old masonry,&#xD;
unsymmetrically arranged, five skeletons in various&#xD;
recesses,'and the clearance had only just begun ; the&#xD;
period of their insertion in this spot must have been&#xD;
more than a century and a-half. From another vault&#xD;
full of sculls and scattered human remains there was&#xD;
a shaft about four feet square, ascending perpendicu-&#xD;
larly to the first floor of the building, and ending in&#xD;
a passage off th~ hall of the chancery, where a trap-&#xD;
door lay between the Tribunal and the way into a&#xD;
suite of rooms destIned for one of the officials.' The&#xD;
object of this shaft could admit but of one surmise.&#xD;
The groun 'of the vault was made up of decayed ani-&#xD;
mal matter, a lump of which held embedded in it a&#xD;
long' silke lock of hair, as I found on personal 'ex~&#xD;
examination, s it was shovelled up from' below. Why&#xD;

lying outside the structure, this charnel-house should&#xD;
be contrived under the dwelling, passes my ken.&#xD;
But that is not all: there are two large subterranean&#xD;
lime-kilns, if I may so call them, shaped like a bee-&#xD;
hive, in masonry, filled with layers of calciued bones,&#xD;
forming the substratum of two other chambers on the&#xD;
ground4ioor, in the immediate vicinity of the very&#xD;
mysterious shaft above mentioned. I know not what&#xD;
interest you may attach to what looks like a chapter&#xD;
from Mrs. Radcliffe, but had I not the .evidence of&#xD;
my own senses, I would never have dreamt of such&#xD;
appearances in a prison of the Holy Office, being&#xD;
thoroughly sick of the nonsense that has for years&#xD;
been put forth on this topic by partizan pens."&#xD;
Daily .N~wa, April, 1849.&#xD;
The following address, by the Author of this&#xD;
volume, was extensively, circulated, and promptly re.&#xD;
sponded to. The females of Great Britain poured in&#xD;
their memorials to the Queen, and~also to Parliament,&#xD;
and the subject was taken up by influential members&#xD;
of both Houses; and the bills of Mr. Chambers and&#xD;
Mr. Whiteside, for inspection and regulation of nun-&#xD;
neries, have been submitted to the legislature. A.&#xD;
ropish faction seemed sworn to defeat them: by fair&#xD;
means they cannoP-they will not long do so by foul.&#xD;

law cannot reach.&#xD;
One, in the shining circle of England's nobility,&#xD;
has indeed been plucked from the mela~iieEoTy seclu-&#xD;
sion; but there are few who have th~ Chancelloi~$f~&#xD;
the kingdom to break their chains. Let the women&#xD;
of Britain bestir themselves in behalf of their weeping&#xD;
sisters, whose very cries f~r liberty do but commit&#xD;
them to deeper dungeons. Let the case of the op-&#xD;
pressed be carried to the foot of the throne. J#t the&#xD;
Queen of England be petitioned to recommend to the&#xD;
consideration of Parliament a measure for the opening&#xD;
of the Convent cells; not to force out of them any&#xD;
who may wish to remain, but to give free egress to&#xD;
those who pine in the chains of the Priest and the&#xD;
Abbess. The genius of British liberty detests the&#xD;
underground mysteries of the DOonvent. If all be&#xD;
right which is enacted there, why is not all open?&#xD;
If the inhabitants stay willingly, why are they shut&#xD;
in with high walls and iron bars? Are they prison-&#xD;
ers, 'or lunatics, or both? Both, we believe. Many&#xD;
a nun dies raving mad. Some try voluntarily to seek,&#xD;
as they vainly think, the ways to heaven. Let them&#xD;
stay. It is only the constrained, the oppressed, the&#xD;
wretched that we would liberate.&#xD;
No mother in Britain can tell how soon her&#xD;
da hter may be allured into one of these bastiles.&#xD;
Ho can she bear to think that the voice which once&#xD;
