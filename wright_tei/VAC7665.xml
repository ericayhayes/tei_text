THE somewhat remarkable statements and incidents which&#xD;
make up this volume must be their own justification and&#xD;
defence. The publishers are assured that, in the 'main, the&#xD;
whole narrative is a real experience, whose truthfulness will be&#xD;
attested by many parties in New York, Montreal and elsewhere,&#xD;
who are cognizant of the history of the heroine of the auto-&#xD;
biography. If true, it certainly is a strange revelation, giving&#xD;
lights and shades of society and politics abroad which do not&#xD;
enter into the received records: if nut true, it is at least a fic-&#xD;
tion which has novelty enough, in its real Irish communicative-&#xD;
ness and recklessness of "artistic" requisitions, to render it a&#xD;
readable book.&#xD;

&#xD;
INTRODUCTORY.&#xD;
lioMA~c1~ is not necessarily fiction. Some lifeexperiences&#xD;
have come to our knowledge whose novelty avas more startling&#xD;
than any fiction-more romantic than any professed romance&#xD;
which we ever read. hence, when we are made acquainted&#xD;
with the strange revelations of some unusual life, we are not&#xD;
too rigidly indisposed to lend a listening ear, and do not turn&#xD;
away with impatience from a narrative which merely ~eem~ in-&#xD;
crudible. "Jane Eyre" challenge(I remark; for, being a pro-&#xD;
fessed autobiography, the critical public wcre indisposed to give&#xD;
its statements credence; yet, when Mrs. Gaskell told us all the&#xD;
circumstances of Charlotte Bronte's life, we were made aware&#xD;
of the not exaggerated pain, passion and pathos of her book. So&#xD;
of other works ~ve might name: though professedly written as fic-&#xD;
tion they still are life-transcripts, heart-histories, most truthful&#xD;
where the dramatic interest is most intense, most re~il where the&#xD;
romance is most remarkable.&#xD;
When the manuscript of the following hook was first sub-&#xD;
rnitted to our inspection, the impression made upon our mind wam&#xD;
one of incredulity; for, though it did not seem at all impossi-&#xD;
ble that such events as are herein narrated should have tran~&#xD;
spired, it still appeared to us unlikely that they should have hap-&#xD;
pened. The nature of the events upon which the whole avork&#xD;
depends for its interest, took on the air of ?sflneccs8ary moment&#xD;

v1&#xD;
&#xD;
INTRODUCTORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
and the incidents seemed too important for the accomplishment&#xD;
of the end at length attained. But, an interview with the&#xD;
author-her narrative of a life history which she had painfully&#xD;
been living for years-the evidence which she adduced con-&#xD;
firmatory of' her statements-tended again to direct attention&#xD;
to her narrative; and, with the new light upon it which her&#xD;
personal explanations shed, we were inclined to undertake the&#xD;
editorial supervision necessary to fit the manuscript for the&#xD;
press.&#xD;
That supervision has been restricted to the preparation of&#xD;
good printer's copy, rather than directed to the reconstruction of&#xD;
the narrative. We found the work so thoroughly individual, the&#xD;
scenes and persons so evidently from life, the incidents so in&#xD;
keeping with the unmistakably Irkh character of the book, that&#xD;
we deemed it best to give the "romance" full expression; thus&#xD;
to let the volume tell its story as its author would have repeated&#xD;
it from her lips, had she been called upon so to do.&#xD;
The reader will be inclined to question some of the senti-&#xD;
ments and revelations of the work, as being of a nature which&#xD;
calls for further proof of authenticity before their admission&#xD;
to a full belief; and lie will, perhaps, ejaculate "Impossible I"-&#xD;
"Improbable 1" at some of the predicaments of its leading char-&#xD;
acters. But, let him (or her) reflect upon what we have said in&#xD;
the first paragraph of this Introductory, and seek to read with&#xD;
a mind not pre-fortified against the novel statements and&#xD;
scenes of the Irish Girl's story; for its "romance," we are sure,&#xD;
has in it too much of fact to warrant its repudiation either as&#xD;
an autobiography, or as a story of life as it is on two con-&#xD;
tinents.                                     F. F. B.&#xD;

THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL;&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.&#xD;
ChAPTER I.&#xD;
Th 1824, a child was presented for baptism in Benz&#xD;
mare church, Ferinanagh County, Ireland. In her&#xD;
baptism, wherein she was made "a member of Christ,&#xD;
a child of God and an inheritor of the Kingdom of&#xD;
Heaven," the little one received the name of Marion&#xD;
Wallace Cunningham, from her god-parents, who&#xD;
also promised and vowed three things in her name:&#xD;
First, that she would renounce the devil and all his&#xD;
works; second, that she would believe in all the&#xD;
articles of the Christian faith; and, thirdly, that she&#xD;
would do God's holy will and commandments, and&#xD;
walk in the same all the days of her life.&#xD;
The ceremony of Marion's baptism was conducted&#xD;
by the IRev. II. Hamilton, who was assisted by the&#xD;
curate and clerk-the latter recording the vows,&#xD;
while the former held the bowl from which the water&#xD;
was taken- for the baptism. The child's godfathers&#xD;
were Sir henry Gordon, and Lord Charles Elia; and&#xD;
her godmothers, Lady May, and Miss hamilton.&#xD;

8        THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL;                               OR~ LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.         9&#xD;
&#xD;
Lord Enniskellen and lady, and Lord Elia and lady&#xD;
also stood as sponsors. Nor was this touching occa-&#xD;
sion free from the "sin of envy, of malice, and all&#xD;
uncharitableness." Huston, the curate, had been&#xD;
requested by Lord Elia to be present and hold the&#xD;
bowl-not as a compliment, as the simple curate&#xD;
believed; but rather to exact a menial service from&#xD;
a person whom he held in unmerited contempt.&#xD;
The reason of this dislike was variously accounted&#xD;
for. Some thought it arose from the old lord's hatred&#xD;
toward the Irish; and Huston was an Irishman.&#xD;
Others scrupled not to say that Elia dreaded the&#xD;
knowledge Huston possessed of his private character.&#xD;
*         Be that a~ it may, Ehia never attended church when&#xD;
Huston preached, which was every alternate Sabbath.;&#xD;
and protected himself from the observation of the&#xD;
Irish when he went to hear hamilton, by occupying&#xD;
a wing built by himself, with an outside entrance, and&#xD;
stained glass partition through which lie could see&#xD;
the minister, and move with the service, without&#xD;
himself being seen. It was quite true that Elia's&#xD;
disgust at the Irish was such that he could not hear&#xD;
theni spoken of without losing his patience ;nor bear&#xD;
their looking at him without being angry.&#xD;
Some time after the christening of Marion, his&#xD;
irritability was increased tenfold by a difficulty which&#xD;
took place in his own family, under the following&#xD;
circumstances:&#xD;
Ills son, Lord Charles Ella, had attempted to abuse&#xD;
the person of his mother's maid, Mary Foxvler; and&#xD;
had laid himself liable to be transported for life, if&#xD;
*          she could get justice. To prevent any such conse~&#xD;
&#xD;
quence, Lord Elia had her confined in the castle,&#xD;
where she was to be kept until she would consent to&#xD;
be put on board a ship bound to America, leaving&#xD;
her parents under the impression that she had eloped.&#xD;
Mary refused to do this thing, resolving to trust in&#xD;
God, and let the worst come, rather than thus will-&#xD;
fully afflict her parents; and her firmness finally&#xD;
brought its reward.&#xD;
Lord Elia's steward was the only servant who&#xD;
knew what had become of her, and he had strict&#xD;
orders to allow her only as much food as would keep&#xD;
her from perisliing-an injunction lie secretly took&#xD;
the liberty of disobeying; but he could not take off&#xD;
the chains her master had locked on her limbs to&#xD;
procure her submission. Mary's pei ~istency, and&#xD;
some compunction of conscience from having so&#xD;
lately taken a sponsor's vows-both lie and his son-&#xD;
made Elia more willing that Mary should get safely&#xD;
out of the country; not that he cared so much for&#xD;
the immorality of his son's deed, but that he feared,&#xD;
should the affair conic to Lord Cunninghani's ears,&#xD;
his lordship would feel insulted, and perhaps take the&#xD;
part of the helpless girl they were so cruelly pei'se-&#xD;
cuting. In the meantime, Mary's sufferings had&#xD;
become so intense that her moans had begun to&#xD;
attract attention, causing much excitement among&#xD;
the servants. It was unsafe to keep her any longer&#xD;
in her present condition; kill her he dare not;&#xD;
release her he dare not; what was to be done? his&#xD;
eldest son had been banished on board a transport&#xD;
ship, for shooting young Tom Arsdale, son of Gen.&#xD;
Arsdale; but 1w was an equal; to be prosecuted by&#xD;

&#xD;
Mary, a peasant girl, was quite another thing. "A&#xD;
beggar's brat! outrageous! he wouldsendherto-.-?"&#xD;
But, he thought, she may be more humble by this&#xD;
time; at a11 events he would see and talk with her.&#xD;
Accordingly he bad her brought through a dark pas-&#xD;
sage to a private room; but her suffering and her&#xD;
resolution combined, gave her so ferocious an appear-&#xD;
ance that the old lord believed her insane, and had&#xD;
her remanded to her prison. He now felt confident&#xD;
that she was incapable of doing him much harm,&#xD;
still it was desirable to have her out of the way. His&#xD;
first move was to discharge his steward, and offer him&#xD;
five thousand pounds sterling to take her out of Ire.&#xD;
land in two weeks' time.&#xD;
The steward, Thomas McLain, with well assumed&#xD;
reluctance at length consented to oblige his master&#xD;
by undertakiI~g the commission. A draft on the bank&#xD;
of Liverpool was put in his hands, and his next care&#xD;
was to inform Mary of his plans, and counsel her to&#xD;
hold herself in readiness to be restored to freedom;&#xD;
for, as soon as he could see her parents and bring her&#xD;
their consent to a marriage with him, he should&#xD;
return to liberate her.&#xD;
A few hours longer, and McLain had brought to the&#xD;
poor captive, whose parents had not been informed&#xD;
of her real situation, the necessary approval, and&#xD;
about the hour of midnight, the marriage ceremony&#xD;
was pronounced by a Wesleyan Methodist minister&#xD;
in presence of Lord and Lady Elia, making Mary the&#xD;
wife of Thomas McLain. The poor bride's appear-&#xD;
ance so affected Lady Elia, that she sickenened and&#xD;
fainted at the sight; for she had loved her pretty&#xD;
&#xD;
maid, and had given a promise to her mother that she&#xD;
should be kindly cared for in her hands; alas, how&#xD;
was she crushed and broken, body and spirit!&#xD;
As soon as the ceremony was over, Thomas hurried&#xD;
away his wife to the house of the officiating minister,&#xD;
where he had permission to leave her until the next&#xD;
day. Proceeding as rapidly as possible, he procured&#xD;
a warrant for the arrest of Lord Elia and his son, for&#xD;
abusing the person of Mary Fowler. It was neces-&#xD;
sary to go to Rev. II. llaniilton, rector of that parish,&#xD;
and also justice of the peace, to get the warrant signed.&#xD;
This Mr. hamilton refused to do, so great is the awe&#xD;
in which the Irish clergy hold themselves of the aris-&#xD;
tocracy. lie went next to the rector of Mana parish,&#xD;
who also refused, because Elia sometimes honored&#xD;
him by coming to hear him preach, when the odious&#xD;
Huston was preaching in Benmare. But McLain,&#xD;
who was not to be baffled, determined to consult&#xD;
Daniel O'Connell, then very successfully practising&#xD;
law. He had an interview with him. Just after see-&#xD;
ing O'Connell, he was met and recognized as Elia's&#xD;
steward by Lord Cunningham, who was about to give&#xD;
him an errand to his master; but Thomas interrupted&#xD;
him by saying he was no longer a servant at the&#xD;
castle.&#xD;
"How so, my boy ~" said Lord Cunningham; "is&#xD;
anything wrong with your master ?"&#xD;
Thomas then told him what had passed, and what&#xD;
he was trying to do. "Let O'Connell alone," said his&#xD;
lordship, "I will fix this matter for you ;" and, accord-&#xD;
ingly~ wrote a note immediately to the Lord Lieute-&#xD;
nant, telling Thomas to carry it, and to take his wife&#xD;

&#xD;
alon~ and if that failed to procure him justice, to&#xD;
let him know, and he would see 'what further could&#xD;
be done.&#xD;
Thus befriended, the grateful fellow turned away,&#xD;
muttering blessings; and hastening' to Mary, made&#xD;
known to her his great fortune in having found so&#xD;
influential a friend. They were soon on their way to&#xD;
Dublin in good spirits, for though Mary was still suf-&#xD;
fering from the wounds made by chains upon her&#xD;
limbs, she felt happy in again being free and in the&#xD;
prospect of obtaining redress for her cruel wrongs.&#xD;
In three days they reached Dublin, where, according&#xD;
to instructions, they presented themselves to his lord-&#xD;
ship and delivered Lord Cunningham's letter.&#xD;
Lord Fowler, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, was&#xD;
a great aristocrat, entertaining for Cunningham the&#xD;
most perfect friendship and confidence, and was&#xD;
always subject to his influence. He was, too, cruel&#xD;
and severe, but condemned that kind of cruelty that&#xD;
Mary had suffered. lie questioned her very closely,&#xD;
and finally gave orders for the arrest of Lord Ehia&#xD;
and son, commanding that they should be placed in&#xD;
close confinement in the county jail. He afterward&#xD;
wrote to Lord Cunningham requesting him to see fair&#xD;
play in the business, and assured McLain that he&#xD;
need not banish himself from Ireland unless he pre-&#xD;
ferred to do so.&#xD;
Having accomplished more than they had expected,&#xD;
Mary and Thomas left Dublin for the home of Mr.&#xD;
John Fowler, Mary's fat1' ~m., grateful to God, Lord&#xD;
Cunningham and the Lord Lieutenant. Mary's&#xD;
health was much improved, and in two days the&#xD;
&#xD;
13&#xD;
&#xD;
young couple reached her father's where great pre-&#xD;
parations were being made for their 'reception.&#xD;
Friends and neighbors, as well as the family, were&#xD;
waiting to congratulate them, and it is to be doubted&#xD;
if in more aristocratic cirdes more delicacy of feeling&#xD;
would have been ~shown, than was exhibited by these&#xD;
poor and homely neighbors while witnessing the&#xD;
meeting between the parents and family of the bride,&#xD;
and the bride herself But the embracing and con-&#xD;
gratulations over between these, the swelling hearts&#xD;
of the waiting company found eXJ)ressiou at last in&#xD;
tears and hand-pressures. Even the Romans, as they&#xD;
are called, had red eyes on this occasion, for enough&#xD;
of Mary's story had transpired to fill their breasts&#xD;
with pity and indignation.&#xD;

ChAPTER II.&#xD;
POOR degraded Ireland! Poor sons and daughters&#xD;
of oppression and misrule; their honest tears, inspired&#xD;
the half ludicrous desire to furnish them with some-&#xD;
thing better than a dirty and ragged sleeve on which&#xD;
to dry their moistened cheeks, and streaming eyes!&#xD;
So felt Mr. Fowler, who had little in common with&#xD;
these people, except poverty; and had his house been&#xD;
larger, a feast had been prepared for his sympathiz-&#xD;
ing neighbors, who now, after a hearty hand-shake&#xD;
all around, returned to their homes, leaving the re-&#xD;
united family to talk over their past and future to-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;
A few quiet days passed, when M~Laiu was unex-&#xD;
pectedly summoned to Dublin, by a command of the&#xD;
Lord Lieutenant. This command gave Mary some&#xD;
apprehension on her husband's account, as she still&#xD;
f9ared the power of Lord Elia; and her distress so&#xD;
much increased with reflection that she determined to&#xD;
accompany him, at all hazards. Her mother and&#xD;
brothers, fearing for her health under any renewed&#xD;
excitement, insisted in keeping her company, which&#xD;
they did; and the little party journeyed to Dublin&#xD;
with sad hearts, having visions of dungeons before&#xD;
their eyes, thinking that lords were beings in whom&#xD;
the poor could confide but little.&#xD;
An accident to Mrs. Fowler, which occurred by the&#xD;
upsetting of the stage, compelled the mother to ro-&#xD;
&#xD;
I-&#xD;
&#xD;
main upon th9 way, and added to Mary's distress, at&#xD;
the same time it deprived her of the comfort and sup&#xD;
port of this parent's needed presence; so that, with&#xD;
her alarm and shattered nerves, Mary was truly in a&#xD;
state bordering on insanity by the time she arrived in&#xD;
Dublin. Albert Fowler, brother of Mary, though&#xD;
he partpok of her apprehension, advised McLain to&#xD;
see the Lord Lieutenant, at Once, and, by ascertaining&#xD;
the cause of the summons, put an end to the suspense&#xD;
of the terrified girl. Thomas, who had good reasons&#xD;
for dreading the interview, caine into the presence of&#xD;
his lordship with undisguised agitation: Lo! the&#xD;
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland trembles before the pea-&#xD;
sant! A glass of wine to each, however, restores,&#xD;
somewhat, their mutual composure, and his lordship,&#xD;
with much kindness of address, contrives to put his&#xD;
humbler companion once more at his ease.&#xD;
"Can you tell me anything of your wife's father ~&#xD;
asked his lordship with much interest.&#xD;
"Very little indeed, your honor, save that he is&#xD;
Mr. John Fowler, arid a thrue gintleman."&#xD;
At the name of John Fowlei', his lordship gave a&#xD;
perceptible start, and proceeded to interrogate Thomas&#xD;
more closely. But he, being really ignorant of the&#xD;
subject upon which he was~questioned, and feeling&#xD;
anxious for Mary, begged to be excused, promising to&#xD;
send in his stead a son of Mr. Fowler, who was then&#xD;
in Dublin.&#xD;
"Ah! exclaimed his lordship, "then do so iinme-&#xD;
diately." Thomas returned to Mary and Albert with&#xD;
a lighter heart-at once informing the latter what he&#xD;
had promised for him, and assuring him there was&#xD;

nothing to fear. But Albert, who remembered that&#xD;
his father always avoided any communication with&#xD;
any one concerning his family affiUrs, was a good deal&#xD;
troubled in spirit about this inevitable catechism&#xD;
which he was to undergo, as well as exercised with&#xD;
curiosity concerning the motive of it. A fear beset&#xD;
him that some disclosure would be. made affecting his&#xD;
father's honor, and he felt that both for his father's&#xD;
sake and his own, he did not wish the discovery made.&#xD;
It was, therefore, with no vei'y enviable sensations&#xD;
that he found himself in the dreaded presence.&#xD;
At the first glimpse of the boy's face, his lordship&#xD;
involuntarily uttered the name of John Fowler! and&#xD;
sprang forward to meet him.&#xD;
"My name is Albert," lie said, between diffidence&#xD;
and surprise, at this unlocked for demonstration.&#xD;
"Albert ~ ejaculated the old man, sinking into a&#xD;
seat, quite overpowered with emotion. "Albert, my&#xD;
own name! Boy, tell me something of your father&#xD;
-of his parentage-his fortunes-his present pros-&#xD;
perity."&#xD;
Filled with surprise, Albert proceeded to relate all&#xD;
that was known to him: that his father had quarrelled&#xD;
with his relatives early in life, since which time no&#xD;
intercourse had passed between them-that even his&#xD;
children knew nothing about their relations, but only&#xD;
were aware of the great fear their father had, that&#xD;
they might sometime become known to Iiiem-aiid&#xD;
that he entertained a great dislike to the aristocracy.&#xD;
"So lie is unforgiving still," muttered the old man.&#xD;
"Is he yet angry with his friends-with his father ?"&#xD;
he asked, eyeing Albert wistfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN Two WORLDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I never heard him speak in anger," replied Ak.&#xD;
bert, "but have heard him say, 'a parent who would&#xD;
misuse a child to please a heartless social sentinient,&#xD;
or whiowould sell his children for the approbation of a&#xD;
corrupt aristocracy, would not be likely to prove a&#xD;
true friend to any, not even to his children's children,&#xD;
and I have always, suspected that to be the reason&#xD;
why lie avoided his connections;~tliougli I do not know&#xD;
that his connections are aristocratic, or that they ever&#xD;
oppressed the poor, as lie says the aristocracy do."&#xD;
The turn the conversation was taking, rather added&#xD;
to the nervousness of his lordship, and, without fur-&#xD;
thor explanation, lie dismissed Albert, promising to&#xD;
see him the next day.&#xD;
It was a painful fact that Lord Fowler had under-&#xD;
takei~ a serious trial of his own strength of character,&#xD;
in to right wrongs he had himself commit-&#xD;
ted, so long ago that the memory of them was pass-&#xD;
ing away from the minds of all except those most&#xD;
nearly involved; and he was conscious of wanting&#xD;
time for self examination before committing himself&#xD;
further in the matter. Th~ old pride and obstinacy&#xD;
arose within him, as he .thought of humbling himself&#xD;
before his long-banished son, and acknowledging a&#xD;
tether's affection for the disobedient child. lie had&#xD;
set resentment in the contest against feeling and duty,&#xD;
and tried to strengthen the side of resentment in vain.&#xD;
He was, of late, contiflually vanquished by the weak-&#xD;
ness of old age, and the longing again to be surrounded&#xD;
by his own kindred and blood. Many had been&#xD;
the sorrows his earlier management of his family had&#xD;
brought upon him. Proud of his own connection by&#xD;

marriage, with a family greater than his own, he had&#xD;
been resolved upon securing for his sons equally ad-&#xD;
vantageous marriages; and had succeeded in getting&#xD;
for Janies, his oldest son-an ardent, impulsive youth&#xD;
-a wife, high in rank, but thoroughly vain and heart.'&#xD;
less in character, who made him miserable by her&#xD;
levity, and finally drove him to the commission of crime&#xD;
by sacrificing his honor to her vanity, He shot both&#xD;
his wife and her paramour, and fled his country never&#xD;
to return.&#xD;
Soured by the unhappy event, Lord Fowler threw&#xD;
the blame upon Lady Fowler, who, he declared, by&#xD;
her softness and sentimentality with her children, had&#xD;
ruined their strength of charaetei', and unfitted them&#xD;
for society as it was. From that time forward, th~ fond&#xD;
mother was denied the privilege of macli intercourse&#xD;
with her remaining children, with a view to instill in&#xD;
them more wisdom and self-rule. The poor lady,&#xD;
already broken-hearted, was plunged in despair by this&#xD;
new trial, and was never again well or cheerful-a&#xD;
fact which greatly irritated her lord, for lie really was&#xD;
fond of her, and desired her to be happy in him alone.&#xD;
But all Lord Fowler's prectmtions failed to prevei~t&#xD;
his son John from entertaining views of his own about&#xD;
marriage, which, at length, brought upon him his&#xD;
father's heartiest wrath, and, hastened the destruction&#xD;
of all family ties in that household.&#xD;
While still quite a lad, ho had conceived a fancy&#xD;
for a pretty child, one of the beggars' offspring which&#xD;
were numerous enough upon his father's estate, and&#xD;
had carried into execution the romantic design of&#xD;
placing her under respectable guardianship, and&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN Two wORLDS.         19&#xD;
giving her a respectable elilcation. All this had&#xD;
been done privately, and more to gratify a love for&#xD;
the extraordinary than because he possessed any real&#xD;
sympathy for that class of persons, as a class. But&#xD;
when the child had developed into the woman-a&#xD;
woman of more than ordinary attractions-the stolen&#xD;
visits which the young man made to his beautiful ward&#xD;
assumed an unexpected interest; and in due course&#xD;
of such affairs, became those of a lover to the woman&#xD;
of his choice. The final result of John's romance&#xD;
was a private marriage with a portionless girl of no&#xD;
family, or rather of a family of beggars. This indis-&#xD;
cretion was sufficiently offensive to have provoked&#xD;
the wrath of a more indulgent father; but in Lord&#xD;
Fowler's estimation it was the most unpardonable of&#xD;
social and domestic sins. So well was John aware of&#xD;
his position that the secret of his marriage was not&#xD;
brought to light until by his father's announcing to&#xD;
him an engagement which had just been completed&#xD;
with a family of consequence. His betrothal to a&#xD;
daughter of that family compelled the long deferred&#xD;
explanation of his marriage.&#xD;
The surprise and fury of Lord Fowler was past all&#xD;
expression, and John, Who had hitherto meekly&#xD;
remained in his father's home, hoping for some event&#xD;
which would give him at least a pt~rtial independence,&#xD;
found it expedient to depart in all haste. But his&#xD;
lordship's second thought was to prevent his son's&#xD;
departure; and accordiigl~, on some pretence, John&#xD;
was decoyed into the castle and locked in his room,&#xD;
where his reflections wera anything but enviable.&#xD;
Had his father turned him out of doors, it would&#xD;

&#xD;
have been no more than he expected; but this impri-&#xD;
sonment lie feared had some other motive than pun-&#xD;
ishment. In this suspicion he was quite correct.&#xD;
The enraged lord took immediate measures ftr the&#xD;
discovery of his son's wife, in the hope that he could&#xD;
induce her to leave the country, or not succeeding in&#xD;
this, that he could conspire against her honor in such&#xD;
a way as to compel her husband to cast her off~&#xD;
John, however, had guarded his secret well, and the&#xD;
search proved ineffectual. Lord Fowler then had&#xD;
recourse to threats with his prisoner in order to obtain&#xD;
the desired information; but John was firm. To his&#xD;
mother, who was once1permitted to see him, lie eon-&#xD;
fessed everything, except that; which would, jt dis-&#xD;
covered, en(lan(rer his wife's liberty, and entreated&#xD;
her 1)ardon for bringing on her this new trouble. lie&#xD;
then bade her farewell, kno~ving that the chances of&#xD;
another meeting with her were small indeed.&#xD;
Violence having failed of its object in bringing his&#xD;
son to terms, Lord Fowler next resorted to artifice,&#xD;
giving utterance to such expressions as mio'ht lead&#xD;
b&#xD;
John to believe that he was becoming reconciled,-&#xD;
and finally made a proposition in apparent good&#xD;
faith, that his son should bring his wife to the castle&#xD;
to reside. here the dissimulation of one was fully&#xD;
equal to that of the other, since John accepted the&#xD;
offer with an air of gratitude that might have&#xD;
rewarded a more sincere overture; but declined the&#xD;
proposition of his father that servants should be sent&#xD;
with a carriage to briiig her, in~ting instead, on&#xD;
going for her in person, with only one attendant-&#xD;
an excursion fro~in which he never had returned, up to&#xD;
&#xD;
the time when the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland saw&#xD;
his grandson Albert at his residence in Dublin!&#xD;
In all these years the austere lord had ample&#xD;
leisure to regret the compulsory measures used&#xD;
toward his son; since lie not only suffered in his own&#xD;
feelings the reproaches of nature, but Lady Fowler&#xD;
had fallen a victim to her excessive grief for her&#xD;
children; and also his daughter Ellen, a delicate girl,&#xD;
had seemed to waste away much more after these&#xD;
occurrences, until, at length, she too died, and he&#xD;
was left widowed and childless.&#xD;
The remembrance of all these events forced them-&#xD;
selves painfully upon the Lord Lieutenant's mind&#xD;
during the time he held parley with his inclinations&#xD;
in Albert's absence. The injured pride of rank, and&#xD;
the resentment for John's disobedience, were fast&#xD;
giving way under the assaults of paternal impulses,&#xD;
and by the time appointed for the meeting with his&#xD;
grandson on the following day; Lord Fowler had&#xD;
determined upon acknowledging his relationship, and&#xD;
sending for his now only child to comfort his declin-&#xD;
ing years.&#xD;
Great was John Fowler's agitation on receiving the&#xD;
summons. Not that from the beginning of these&#xD;
adventures he had not looked forward to the possi-&#xD;
bility of such an event, but that now his identity was&#xD;
discovered, he was troubled with the recollection of&#xD;
those old differences with his father, and regret,&#xD;
resentment and tenderness were uncomfortably min-&#xD;
gled in his thoughts. A strong desire to know some-&#xD;
thing more of his mother and sister gave a nervous&#xD;
eagerness to his anticipations of the proposed meet-&#xD;

ing, and when it was consented to seemed to wing&#xD;
his feet with impatience.&#xD;
The wife for whom this long estrangement had been&#xD;
suffered, was awaiting him at the place of her acci-&#xD;
dent, from which she was now recovered. The younger&#xD;
children, too, were of the party, going to such an&#xD;
aristocratic house as the Lord Lieutenant's, and Mary&#xD;
and her humble husband. The Fowler blood had&#xD;
commenced to mingle with plebeian, and this was&#xD;
the second step in the descent-a step which possibly&#xD;
might have been avoided if the head of the house&#xD;
had overlooked the first departure from the high&#xD;
road to honors and wealth.&#xD;
John's feelings of doubt and coldness toward his.&#xD;
father melted away, when, upon coining to his apart-&#xD;
ment, the door was opened by his lordship, who ex-&#xD;
claimed, "Thank God, that I see my son living !" This&#xD;
reception, not altogether what he expected, quite dis-&#xD;
armed the son, and the reunion was a happy one. A&#xD;
hasty introduction of John's family was made, who&#xD;
were very cordially received. "But my mother and sis.&#xD;
ter ?" said John, looking anxiously in his father's face.&#xD;
"You have no mother or sister in this life, John,"&#xD;
answered Lord Fowler. John buried his face in his&#xD;
hands without a word, for his thoughts were very&#xD;
bitter. His father, while he respected his sorrow,&#xD;
tried to divert it by attentions to his wife and child-&#xD;
ren. Some letters and presents that Ellen and his&#xD;
mother had left for him, should he ever be found,&#xD;
were brought forward; and the contents of the let-&#xD;
ters restored peace to John's heart, for they contained&#xD;
only love and kind wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        23&#xD;
&#xD;
Though John soon came to feel at his ease, not so&#xD;
with his wife, who, added to her consciousness of her&#xD;
forced relationship, had a fear that her husband would&#xD;
now forget all her long, hard struggle with care and&#xD;
poverty, and begin to undervalue that patient labor by&#xD;
which she had so long kept himself and their child-&#xD;
ren from want and degradation; for it had been the&#xD;
hardy peasant woman, and not the helpless son of a&#xD;
lord, who kept want from their cottage door, through&#xD;
all these years in which the children were born and&#xD;
reared. The change was less desirable to the mother&#xD;
than to any member of the fandly; and it was with&#xD;
great self-control she brought herself to call the&#xD;
haughty old lord, "father," though she did it in the&#xD;
same spirit she had always made sacrifice and done&#xD;
impossible things for the sake of others.&#xD;
The youngest child of the flock, little Annie, was&#xD;
more successful than anybody else in making the&#xD;
first awkwardness of their new condition less percep-&#xD;
tible. To her a grandfather was a new thing, and the&#xD;
artlessness with which she said "why, he is only a&#xD;
man," when he was presented to her in that relation,&#xD;
tended greatly to enliven the too emotional scene.&#xD;
The old lord bantered Albert on having so nearly&#xD;
read him a lecture at their first interview, and when&#xD;
at the breaking up of the family party for the first&#xD;
evening in their new home, he insisted on a kiss all&#xD;
round, even from the dignified matron, the coldness&#xD;
of years seemed fairly melted away, and a bond of&#xD;
peace established between the lately estranged rela-&#xD;
tions. So happily terminated Mary's painful adven-&#xD;
tures.&#xD;

&#xD;
ChAPTER III.&#xD;
SOON after the family were established in the Lord&#xD;
Lieutenant's house, Lord Cunningham paid his friend&#xD;
a visit to inquire what was to be done in the case of&#xD;
Lord Ehia. his surprise at the discovery of the rela-&#xD;
tionship between the plaintiff and his excellence was&#xD;
very great indeed. Of course he declined taking any&#xD;
further steps in the prosecution of Mary's enemies, a.s&#xD;
she no longer needed his interference. The explana-&#xD;
tion which was given of Lord Fowler's family affairs&#xD;
startled Lord Cunningham very sensibly; for, in all&#xD;
his intimacy with him, lie had never detected that&#xD;
spirit of absolute rule which the circumstances of the&#xD;
story indicated. On the contrary, he had mistaken&#xD;
him for a liberalist, a1s he now told him. "I am&#xD;
learning to be less despotic as I grow older," said his&#xD;
excellence, "a change by no means uncommon."&#xD;
Lord Cunningham Was a Scotchman by birth, and,&#xD;
it might be said, in feeling. In person lie was fine-&#xD;
looking, though not handsome, and had an air of&#xD;
nobility. In character lie was gay, almost reckless,&#xD;
not, however, without being candid and generous.&#xD;
Though an aristocrat in sentiment, his disposition led&#xD;
him to care for the concerns of the common people,&#xD;
to whom his humanity was well known. his father&#xD;
and mother having differed in religious belief, h~&#xD;
used to say that lie was left half-way between the&#xD;
Established Church and the Church of Rome, from&#xD;
&#xD;
which accident it often happened that he succeeded&#xD;
iii pleasing neither. A distant connection of the old&#xD;
"Black" Douglas family, his sentiments were not&#xD;
quite those of "Archibald the Grim," though in&#xD;
many respects not unlike, lie was proud of tl~at&#xD;
trait of the Douglas blood that hetd ~dishonesty, dis-&#xD;
simulation and cowardice to be the worst of faults, and&#xD;
that made it a virtue to protect the weak against une-&#xD;
qual odds. He was no Federalist, and often declared&#xD;
his intention of using his political influence against it.&#xD;
"If you wish to be popular in Parliament, you&#xD;
must not oppose Federalism," said Lord Fowler.&#xD;
"It is the best spoke in the wheel."&#xD;
"It may _be the 8tronge8t," replied Cunningham,&#xD;
"but strength is not always virtue."&#xD;
"In family government, for instance, what princi-&#xD;
pie would you pursue, supposing your children were&#xD;
disobedient ?" asked the Lord Lieutenant.&#xD;
"In the first place," answered Cunningham, "if&#xD;
my children were not obedient, I should conclude&#xD;
either that 1 had not done right by them in the past,&#xD;
or that I was now attempting to exact from them&#xD;
something so unreasonable as to arouse their rebel-&#xD;
lion. I shall endeavor to have my children regard&#xD;
me as their best earthly friend; in which case I shall&#xD;
have no fears for their obedience; and they will have&#xD;
no fears that I shall regard the wishes or interests of&#xD;
others before their own, which I hold it my sAcred&#xD;
duty to consult, always." Lord Cunningham would&#xD;
have gone on at greater length to speak of his p~c~-&#xD;
liar views, but, chancing to observe the expression of&#xD;
Lord Fowler's face, he was reminded that the utter-&#xD;

ance of his sentiments might be unpleasantly sugges-&#xD;
tive on the l)resent occasion, and gracefully turned the&#xD;
talk about children to his own little girl, who had&#xD;
recently been christened at I3eninare church. "I&#xD;
have an infant daughter," said he, "who does not pro-&#xD;
misc much beauty-though her mother is not want-&#xD;
ing in personal charms-but whom I desire to cdii-&#xD;

be allowed to enter thc circles of Pi~liionable dissipa-&#xD;

veloped. I hope to keep her sufficiently interested in&#xD;
her home, both in my house and heart, to gual'd her&#xD;
against any inordinate ambition in the direction of&#xD;
fashion, at least while she is young."&#xD;
"You have chosen a singular name for your daugh-&#xD;
ter," said Lord Fowler.&#xD;
"I named her iMiarion Wallace," said Cunningham,&#xD;
a little nettled at the remark, and slapping his knee&#xD;
violently, "because I wished her to resemble the&#xD;
wife of William Wallace, in discharging her duty to&#xD;
her husband, her country and her God, with heroism,&#xD;
should it ever be her fate to be put to so severe a&#xD;
test."&#xD;
" You are not sul)erstitious then about naming&#xD;
a child after an unfortunate person ?" asked Lord&#xD;
Fowler.&#xD;
"An Englishman might be excusable for having a&#xD;
supei'stition about that particular name," answered&#xD;
Cunningham a little sarcastically, "but to a Scotch-&#xD;
man's ears it is ever a pleasant sound, inspiring&#xD;
reverence and regard beyond the ordinary power of&#xD;
miames to inspire feeling."&#xD;

After all, who shall say that "superstitions" are&#xD;
not governed by spiritual intuitions! They some-&#xD;
times put on faces in whose depths of' eXpression&#xD;
glow the subtle lights of inspiration.&#xD;
John Fowler was very much pleased with Lord&#xD;
Cunningham. lie spoke sentiments that found echo&#xD;
in his breast; and it pained him to see how far his&#xD;
father still differed from men of this stamp-of the&#xD;
liberal and huniane order. Yet occupying the posi-&#xD;
tion which he did, of lord, king and governor of&#xD;
Ireland, a country which always had been subject to&#xD;
the most oppressive rule, it was difficult for a man of&#xD;
his natural severity and educational prejudices to full&#xD;
easily into a more democratic opinion. The people&#xD;
were accustomed to arbitrary government, and he&#xD;
was without the genius to know how to modify that&#xD;
government to their best interests, or even to under-&#xD;
stand what those best interests were. Besides, he&#xD;
was an Englishman, and to an Englisl imnan, the Irish&#xD;
are utterly repulsiVe-secretly so, if not always con-&#xD;
fessed. In talking over politics with Lord Cunning-&#xD;
ham, it was easy enough to perceive that lie had all&#xD;
the English contempt for the people he had to&#xD;
govern- that he looked upon the views of "reform-&#xD;
ers" as altogether visionary and '-speculative.&#xD;

of the life, which before, in laboring to sustain, we&#xD;
had been happy.&#xD;
But for his father's opposition to such a proceed-&#xD;
ing, John would cheerfully have returned to the hum-&#xD;
ble home, ~vhieh through many trials and many&#xD;
enjoyments had become so pleasant to him. As it&#xD;
was, in absence of any more rational occupation, he&#xD;
was fain to take to building air castles that could be&#xD;
pulled down and rel)uilt daily and hourly.&#xD;
The first visit which the Lord Lieutenant received&#xD;
from over the Channel, gave his son as well as himself&#xD;
the benefit of a little excitement, inasmuch as the&#xD;
guests were people of distinction who had known the&#xD;
family in years past, and who persisted in inquiring&#xD;
into the history of John's marriage relations, after&#xD;
first making the blunder of mistaking John for James,&#xD;
whom they were surprised to see at large in Ireland.&#xD;
Upon learning something of the real facts in relation&#xD;
to his son, who was now Lord John, apologies were&#xD;
made but too late to restore good feeling. Improper&#xD;
or rather disagreeable signs of astonishment at the&#xD;
supposed temerity of James, whose fate was unknown&#xD;
to his own family, had aroused the ire of Lord Fow-&#xD;
1cr in the first instance, and no apology could make&#xD;
him forget the evident feeling of injury his visitors&#xD;
had betrayed at the fancied hum unity of his ban-&#xD;
ished and guilty eldest son. Neither could any&#xD;
assumed respect cover the sneer which marked the&#xD;
first avowal of Lady John Fowler's origin. 11cr&#xD;
dignity, good sense and intelligence were counted&#xD;
nothing by these scions of "noble blood," who could&#xD;
not remember that even royalty itself was not always&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN TWO woRLDs.          29&#xD;
&#xD;
royal-that often it is blood of the ba8est sort they&#xD;
are taking so much pains to keep "unmixed." The&#xD;
result of this visit was to disgust Lord Fowler with&#xD;
the principles he had once so strenuously supported,&#xD;
and to raise Lady John and her children in his&#xD;
regard, by contrasting them with these supercilious&#xD;
lords and ladies, both in manner and ideas. So&#xD;
surely do these truths work themselves out when&#xD;
opposite principles are brought into actual conflict&#xD;
before a candid mind! When the mind arrives at&#xD;
the power of absolute dispassionate judgment, how&#xD;
quickly and- eagerly does virtue assert its own dig-&#xD;
nity!&#xD;
In the meantime, Lord Elia and Lord Charles were&#xD;
still in confinement, and were to remain there for&#xD;
some time longer though the prosecution was to be&#xD;
dropped. The Lord Lieutenant believed he could&#xD;
punish them better at his leisure than by sendhlg&#xD;
them to New South Wales, a change of programme&#xD;
which was, when known, regretted by the tenantry&#xD;
on the Elia estate. Hitherto they had been so accus-&#xD;
tomed to regard their lord as a being enjoying immu-&#xD;
nity from consequences, whatever the offence against&#xD;
humanity or religion, that the novel idea of a lord in&#xD;
jail afforded them agreeable excitement for some&#xD;
time. This was changing places most unexpectedly,&#xD;
and they were glad, any one of them to give up the&#xD;
residency which debt, brawling or other misdeinea-&#xD;
nors often assigned to one of them, to the lord of the&#xD;
estate. If the crops had failed, so that it was impos-&#xD;

of Erin, when it caine to a choice of occupying it&#xD;
himself or resigning it to a lord, out of the pure good-&#xD;
ness of his heart he preferred to resign it! Even in&#xD;
that touching case where a proctor has given a joint&#xD;
lease to several tenants, and in default of some of&#xD;
them, has compelled one to pay the rent of many,&#xD;
which one in return, from slicer indignation, has been&#xD;
impelled to inflict upon the manceuvring proctor a&#xD;
severe castigation, not altogether undeserved, which&#xD;
entitles himself td the tread-mill or the jail-even in&#xD;
this extreme case the generous Irishman would not&#xD;
fail to abnegate in favor of a lord, more especially&#xD;
when that lord was of such qualities as the lord of&#xD;
the estate of Elia. Therefore, when it was reported.&#xD;
that their lordships were to be taken out of their&#xD;
honorable place of present abode, theme was great dis-&#xD;
satisfaction among the attached tenantry of the Elias.&#xD;
Poor unhappy Ireland! England has undertaken&#xD;
to christianize thee in a strange manner. Unjust&#xD;
and unmerciful ministers teach hatred and rebellion,&#xD;
instead of obedience and love. Thy people have no&#xD;
true friends anywhere; but degradation and contempt&#xD;
seem their portion forever. Shall it be forever? Or&#xD;
is there a future in which the Irish shall be restored&#xD;
as a people and a nation to their ancient and rightful&#xD;
heritage. There such a boon in store?&#xD;

ChAPTER IV.&#xD;
bun CUNNINGHAM was in Scotland. His errand&#xD;
was to obtain a Scotch nurse for his infant daughter&#xD;
-a person who would be, at once, nurse and instruct-&#xD;
ress, and who w~uld stand in the place of a mother to&#xD;
Marion, whose own mother cared little for the wants&#xD;
of infancy. In truth, Lady Cunningham dreaded the&#xD;
care of children; and, though this little daughter was&#xD;
an only child, the fact of her giving no great promise&#xD;
of beauty, completely turned the mother's heart away&#xD;
from her. If she had children they must be able to&#xD;
give her pleasure in the way she desired; but, to acceii~&#xD;
them as a possible blessing she could not. Lord Cun-&#xD;
ningham hence felt the responsibility resting upon him&#xD;
more -deeply, and his tenderness for his child was&#xD;
greatly increased by her loveless situation without&#xD;
Imiua. What a beneficent provision of our nature is it&#xD;
which makes us cling most closely to the persecuted&#xD;
or the deformed.&#xD;
Although his errand was this special one, he wished&#xD;
to indulge his strong national feeling by lingering a&#xD;
while among the ruins of Scotland's ancient glory&#xD;
and strength. By the old Douglas Castle he sat down&#xD;
and wept-wept that the proud and the brave who&#xD;
once dwelt within its walls could not be restored to&#xD;
Scotland, free! Sincerely he wished lie might in-&#xD;
voke some mighty ghost from among those crumbling&#xD;
walls; and in his soul loudly called the brave Doug-&#xD;

the walls answei'ed him with a mournful whisper, as it&#xD;
shook in the wind, lie felt that in due Pine, these&#xD;
(Iry 1)ones should reunite; and, inspired by the spirit&#xD;
of retributive justice, bring terror to their enemies-&#xD;
that Ireland and Scotland should be free! lie&#xD;
observed, with a grateful sense, how carefully the ivy&#xD;
enveloped every remaining stone, as though preserv-&#xD;
ing it for the return of its ancient glory, and kissed&#xD;
the beautiful, the faithful vine.&#xD;
From the castle of his ancestors, Lord Cunningham&#xD;
~vent to Dumbarton, with tIme romantic intention of'&#xD;
spending a night among its soul-stirring associations.&#xD;
There was Wallace's sword, and a tower called Wal-&#xD;
lace's Tower. In this tower he would sleep on the&#xD;
sword of Wallace, if sleep lie could: and hoped that,&#xD;
slee~Ang or waking, lie might have a vision of the&#xD;
hero.&#xD;
Having made his arrangements in the ruins for the&#xD;
night, Cunningham was wrapt in a reverie on the&#xD;
duties of man as a patriot, as well as citizen and father;&#xD;
thinking ho~v, were it not for this last relationship,&#xD;
he should be tempted to rebellion and a fierce strug-&#xD;
gle for rights. He remembered that "God giveth&#xD;
all liberty and upbraideth not." Also, that God's char-&#xD;
acter had been slandered by the serpent in the garden&#xD;
of Eden, who represented that God was a liar, and&#xD;
the woman should not surely die. But, God had&#xD;
avenged the insult; and so he was inclined to believe&#xD;
would He avenge the insult daily heaped upon His&#xD;
generous providence, by those governments who, ser-&#xD;
pent-like, deny his intention of dispensing alike, libe-&#xD;

rally to all; and who, assuming everything to them-&#xD;
selves, put off the needy and helpless with the assur~&#xD;
ance that, for t1te~n only, has God "provided liberally&#xD;
and upbraided not."&#xD;
While these thoughts were running through his&#xD;
mind, he was startled by the unexpected sound of&#xD;
human voices. Thinking of those outlaws who some-&#xD;
times take refuge 'in these deserted places, he snatched&#xD;
the precious sword of Wallace, which lie had taken&#xD;
from its careful preserve, and prepared for an encoun-&#xD;
ter. He soon discovered, however, that the voice&#xD;
came from a pei'sofl in distress; and, although still&#xD;
fearing he might fall into unpleasant company, deter-&#xD;
mined upon investigating the cause of the cries. lie&#xD;
crept stealthily along in the direction of the sounds.&#xD;
The persons, whoever they might be, were so much&#xD;
engaged in their personal warfare that he had ap-&#xD;
proached within speaking distance before they ob-&#xD;
served him. Contrary to his surmises, his appear-&#xD;
ance seemed to occasion more consternation than&#xD;
anger or suspicion; and lie soon saw that the persons&#xD;
were fugitives of no common sort. He could not, by&#xD;
the moonlight that struggled through the windows,&#xD;
distinguish countenances, even were they undisguised;&#xD;
but, by the voice of the person in distress, he per-&#xD;
ceived that one was a woman; and, noticing tfiat her&#xD;
companion seemed frightened and irresolute, lie was&#xD;
the first to speak and demand ~in explanation of her&#xD;
condition.&#xD;
"Oh, I know not what to do," said the voice bf a&#xD;
boy, "IL have the Lady Emma Cunningham here, and&#xD;
she is very ill."&#xD;

"Lady Emma! good God !" exclaimed Cunning-&#xD;
ham, fearing to trust his ears; " how came the lady&#xD;
Emma in thi6 place, and what is the matter with&#xD;
her ?"&#xD;
"Oh, I do not know-I fear to tell without knowing&#xD;
who you are. I fear she would not like to have it&#xD;
told," cried the boy in great trouble.&#xD;
"I am her brother, my good boy-Lord Charles&#xD;
Cunningham, who is distressed at meeting his sister&#xD;
under such circumstances as these, and who wishes to&#xD;
hear them explained immediatelyy"&#xD;
Thins reassured, the boy began to relate that Lady&#xD;
Emma had fled from home to escape marrying a sui-&#xD;
tor whom her father had commanded her to accept,&#xD;
but whom she could not, because she loved and was&#xD;
betrothed to some other; and because, had that not&#xD;
been the case, the person in question was a dissolute&#xD;
Roman Catholic Frenchman, while she was a devoted&#xD;
Protestant. Tier father's severity~ and the agitation&#xD;
and perils of her flight had made her ill, and her mind&#xD;
wandering.&#xD;
Lord Cunningham had observed that she frequently&#xD;
called upon William Wallace, which was the first&#xD;
indication, the boy said, she had given of being dis-&#xD;
ordered in mind, and supposed her arrival at the castle&#xD;
in a state of high fever, had given her ideas this&#xD;
direction, as she often called upon the dead hero for&#xD;
protection.&#xD;
Cunningham, greatly alarmed, proceeded to admin-&#xD;
ister for her relief. She was moved to a place of com-&#xD;
fort; medical aid was brought and every relief offered&#xD;
that was possible; but nothing reached her disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
She was too utterly exhausted in all her vital powers&#xD;
to bear long either with disease or medicine; and,&#xD;
after fourteen hours of suffering-during which she&#xD;
had only a few moments of consciousness-she ex-&#xD;
pired iii the arms of her brother-a victim of the&#xD;
horrors of ~ usages.&#xD;
"Poor victim of a remorseless despotism !" sighed&#xD;
Lord Cunningham as he held the now still and lovely&#xD;
form in his arms. "What beings are the fathers of&#xD;
Great Britain and Ireland, who fence in their wealth&#xD;
and lordly connections, with the hearts and lives of&#xD;
their own children! heaven and myself, shield my&#xD;
child from such compulsion as my poor, dear sister&#xD;
has suffered ! Rather let her die as Enuna has done,&#xD;
than live to pine in an abhorred marriage."&#xD;
Alone with the dead, in that place of ruins and&#xD;
desolation!&#xD;
The Lady Emma was laid out, her hands crossed,&#xD;
her eyes closed, her hair smoothed and her figure&#xD;
straightened for the grave by the hands of Lord Cun-&#xD;
ningham, who performed these sacred offices tenderly&#xD;
and caressingly, as if it could soothe the spirit late ~o&#xD;

with a party, in search of his missing daughter.&#xD;

eyes, attended by his intended son-in-law--what a&#xD;
meetinod Sudden o'reat reactions of feeling are apt&#xD;
b&#xD;
to be dangerous, and Cunningham was alarmed when&#xD;
he beheld the ghastly face of the father as lie was&#xD;
confronted with the pallid Thriii of his dead daughter.&#xD;
What, then, to him were titles or riches? If lie had&#xD;
a living daughter, wealth might comfort him, or rank&#xD;
make him proud; but now lie had neither comfort&#xD;
nor pride-his oiily daughter lay dead before him&#xD;
dead-and he might accuse himself of her murder.&#xD;
The strong, proud, tyrannical old man was conquered&#xD;
-was weak, dismayed and humbled. There, too, was&#xD;
the bridegroom, cowering and conscience-smitten;&#xD;
and the shocked faces of rough men looking on from&#xD;
a distance.&#xD;
A few moments were given to this scene; then&#xD;
Lord Cunningham signified to the lover his desire to&#xD;
be left alone with his father and sister; an intima-&#xD;
tion complied with almost immediately by the ret~r-&#xD;
ing of the entire party from Dumbarton Castle.&#xD;
The conversation which the father and son held&#xD;
together in this place of mourning, painful as it was,&#xD;
perhaps was more confidential and truly endearing&#xD;
than any that could ever have taken place between&#xD;
these persons, of such different sentiments. It was no&#xD;
place to quarrel over opinions; that dead daughter,&#xD;
lying there in her martyr's robes, was an unanswer-&#xD;
able argument against the stern old Scottish lord.&#xD;
His grief~ too, was excessive, for he was at heart fond&#xD;
of the Lady Emma, and deplored her loss greatly,&#xD;
apart from his remorse of conscience. Lord Charles&#xD;
was careful not to bruise the broken heart, and des-&#xD;

sufferer.&#xD;
In compliance with a sentiment of his own, and a fan-&#xD;
cied wish of his sister's, Lord Charles had her remains&#xD;
interred in a corner of Dumbarton Castle; and her&#xD;
father, if he would have wished to oppose it, felt that&#xD;
he had lost the right.&#xD;
Lord Charles accompanied his father home, feeling&#xD;
that the old man had received a shock from which he&#xD;
would never recover; eventually having accomplished&#xD;
his business in Scotland, he took leave of a country&#xD;
which these unhappy adventures made him desirous&#xD;
of abandoning forever. So do we seek to run away&#xD;
from painful associations, the effect of which, after all,&#xD;

ChAPTER V.&#xD;
WIIEN Lord Cunningham reached home, he found&#xD;
his afl~iirs in considerable confu~ioii. The rents were&#xD;
due, but the people not being able to pay, the l)l~oc-&#xD;
tor had impounded their cattle, by order of Lady&#xD;
Cunningham, who was thoroughly aristocratic in her&#xD;
views of feudal government. Desiring to make an&#xD;
examh)le of the proctor for extreme proceedings with-&#xD;
out his consent, Cunniiighiarn compelled him to&#xD;
restore the cattle to the tenantry with apologies;&#xD;
after which humiliation lie was discharged. An act&#xD;
of so much mercy to the h)OO~ made a sensation, all&#xD;
over northern Ireland. Landlords and tenants were&#xD;
alike interested. It was something new under the -&#xD;
sun, and tenants blessed him in all directions. Per-&#xD;
haps ~ people could better feel and appreciate this&#xD;
clemency than the Irish P~ The charm and the&#xD;
fault of the Irish character is their sensibility. But,&#xD;
however well the tenants were l)leased with Lord&#xD;
Cunningham's movement, the landlords were disaf-&#xD;
fected by it. It was argued thiit such examples&#xD;
would set the people crazy about their "rights ;" for&#xD;
mercy so freely extended to them they would there-&#xD;
after claim as a right. It had always been a point to&#xD;
sustain the proctors in any measures that would col-&#xD;
lect the rents, no matter how hard and unfeeling. A&#xD;
man whose heart was open to the dictates of human-&#xD;
ity was little fitted for the office, and but seldom held&#xD;
&#xD;
it; or, if by chance a little pity was felt, it was care-&#xD;
fully concealed from employers as somediing of&#xD;
which to be ashamed, or to which some penalty must&#xD;
attach.&#xD;
But, in this instance of Lord Cunningham, the&#xD;
unusual favor shown the poor aroused their enthusi-&#xD;
asm by its very incomparableness, and in four weeks&#xD;
from the time their cattle were returned to them the&#xD;
tenants surrounded the castle in hundreds with their&#xD;
rents in their hands. The occasion was quite an excit-&#xD;
ing one, for Roman and Protestant stood there side&#xD;
by side with eager, excited faces, as if they were medi-&#xD;
tating a rebellion, causing~t first a start on the part&#xD;
of the inmates of the castle. A few moments, how-&#xD;
ever, sufficed to show their friendly intentions, and&#xD;
his lordship was called for to answer the shouts of the&#xD;
people. A cheer that rent the very heavens greeted&#xD;
the appearance of their benefactor, who responded to&#xD;
them in a speech, and was answered by a speaker on&#xD;
their part chosen by themselves to present their land-&#xD;
lord with the rents.&#xD;
These scenes, however much they may have grati-&#xD;
fled his lordship, were very displeasing to Lady Cnn-&#xD;
ninghain. She looked with disgust upon this ten-&#xD;
dency toward democracy of sentiment, by interfering&#xD;
in the affairs of the poor. In her estimation it really&#xD;
betrayed "low l)ropensities," and was altogether un-&#xD;
pardonable in a lord. "The same thing," she said,&#xD;
"was apparent in his management of his child, whom&#xD;
he had already indulged in the notion that she must&#xD;

And, poor lady, neither could she; for besides being&#xD;
very punctilious about all matters of etiquette, she&#xD;
disliked children, and especially her own daughter,&#xD;
because she was a bone of contention between her-&#xD;
self and her husband. In vain did she remonstrate,&#xD;
sneer or fret; the father's heart was bound up in the&#xD;
child, and he gave himself up to the pleasure of&#xD;
watching her growth and training with the greatest&#xD;
zeal. Even the parrot was taught to exclaim, "poor&#xD;
Markn !" "good Marion !" "heaven bless you,&#xD;
Marion !" and all such foolish and fond phrases.&#xD;
Lord Cunningham had secured an intelligent and&#xD;
faithful foster-mother for his child, who would guard&#xD;

CHAPTER XTI&#xD;
PAssING over a period of five years, Marion is now&#xD;
seven years of age. rflius far she has been a comfort&#xD;
to hem~ 4~at1mer an(l a constant affliction to her mother,&#xD;
who feels and says, she would more gladly see the&#xD;
grave closed over her child, than see her growing&#xD;
up without the refinement suitable to her statiomi, or&#xD;
with the ridiculously " liberal " views of her father.&#xD;
11cr fastidiousness is daily shocked by the practical&#xD;
manner in which Lord Cunningham discusses the&#xD;
wants of the degraded Irish, and she declares, over&#xD;
and over again, that it is no part of a la(hy's educa-&#xD;
tion to be instructed in the condition of the common&#xD;
PeoPle.&#xD;
There is no comfort in living in Ti'eland," she&#xD;
~vould say, "where the PeoPle are so low and the&#xD;
nobility have no respect for their l)osition."&#xD;
About this time Lord Cunninrhiamn was appointed&#xD;
by Government to settle some business of a public&#xD;
nature in Canada, and much as he disliked going&#xD;
from home, lie would not shrink from what appeared&#xD;
to be his duty in the case. In leaving his own ten-&#xD;
antry lie had no particular fears, because lie knew&#xD;
they were deeply attached to him; but as the distress&#xD;
in Ireland from failure of C~Ol)5 was very severe at&#xD;
this time, lie apprehended a rising of the people,&#xD;
and knowing that Lady Cunningham was no favor-&#xD;
ite with them, feared some harm might come to her,&#xD;
&#xD;
which his servants would not take sufficient pains to&#xD;
l)revelit.&#xD;
Another cause of disquietude was the animosity of&#xD;
the Elias toward himself on account of the assistance&#xD;
he had once rendered to Mary Fowler, against them-&#xD;
selves. They were malicious and 11n1)rincipled men,&#xD;
who in his absence, might avenge themselves ujx~n&#xD;
his family in some unlocked tor manner. Lady Cnn-&#xD;
ningliani refused to see any imperfections in these&#xD;
lordly personages, because they preserved, according&#xD;
to her ideas of propriety, the punctillos of their&#xD;
rank, and the more her husband objected to her inti-&#xD;
macy with them, the more reasons she saw for&#xD;
regarding them with particular friendship.~. lIe only&#xD;
hoped she might not be foolish enough to intrust&#xD;
them with any serious confidence.&#xD;
Ever since the death of his sister, the Lady Emma,&#xD;
Lord Cunningham had been troubled by fits of&#xD;
melancholy which it was impossible to shake off,&#xD;
and on the occasion of taking leave' of his wife and&#xD;
daughter, for so long a journey, his spirits quite failed&#xD;
him; evemi a foreboding of' some great calamity over-&#xD;
shadowed his heart. But commending them to God&#xD;
and the care of faithful servants, one of whom was&#xD;
to be his correspondent, lie bade them farewell.&#xD;
For some time everything went on as usual. But&#xD;
a great misfortune which befell Marion at length&#xD;
brought confusion upon the household. The child&#xD;
was one day playing in an arbor erected on the lawn,&#xD;
when a violent screaming attracting her attention sue&#xD;
ran in the direction of the cries, and discovered her&#xD;
mother in an attitude of alarm warning off some&#xD;

beggars who had just got into the grounds. Seeing&#xD;
that there were several children in the group, and&#xD;
not having a fear of these people, Marion approached&#xD;
the mendicants near enough to see that the poor&#xD;
mother of the flock held a dead baby in her arms,&#xD;
which Marion was thoughtless enough to touch with&#xD;
her hand. It turned out that the child had the&#xD;
small-pox, and when Lady Cunningham's screams&#xD;
had brought the servants to send away the miserable&#xD;
wretches, it became manifest that Marion had exposed&#xD;
herself to the loathsome disease. It only needed this&#xD;
folly on the child's part to fill Lady Cunningham's&#xD;
cup of bitterness toward her. She utterly refused.&#xD;
to have her brought into the house; but ordered her&#xD;
sent to the pest-house to await the course of the ter-&#xD;
rible malady, as she would not suffer any exposure to&#xD;
herself, and it was the child's fault that she had run&#xD;
the risk.&#xD;
This decree with regard to Marion filled the ser-&#xD;
vants with indignation, and the pool' child with ter-&#xD;
ror. Her little, heart was broken by the unnatural&#xD;
desertion and banishment. Yery fortunately for her,&#xD;
the head servant at the castle, one Brooks, deter-&#xD;
mined to take the affair into his own hands; and&#xD;
placing Marion in the care of her nurse who had had&#xD;
the disease, he immediately undertook to find some&#xD;
one among the better class of farmers on the estate,&#xD;
who would take his young mistress under his own&#xD;
care and protection for the necessary period, for the&#xD;
consideration of generous payment. IJis first appli-&#xD;
cation was entirely successful, as the farmer, whose&#xD;
name was Woods, was one of Lord Cunningham's&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        45&#xD;

most attached tenants. He and his good wife sent&#xD;
away such of their own children as had not had the&#xD;
disease, retaining at home only their eldest son, and&#xD;
immediately adopted the little outcast lady ijito their&#xD;
house and hearts. Brooks was an exception to Irish-&#xD;
men generally, for he could control his indignation, if&#xD;
need were, to do what was most expedient. In this&#xD;
case lie had conducted affairs very properly and dis-&#xD;
creetly, altogether in the best manner for Marion.&#xD;
Tie would have offered to take the children of Woods&#xD;
to the castle, but feared Lady Cunningham's displea-&#xD;
sure. They were distributed therefore among the&#xD;
neighboring farmers.&#xD;
The little parlor of the Woods cottage, with the&#xD;
bedroom adjoining, was put in order for Marion and&#xD;
her nurse; and, as yet, she experienced no incon-&#xD;
vemence from her imprudence, the novelty of her sit-&#xD;
uation gave her considerable amusement. The little&#xD;
garden gate, and the stile by it, had their beauties;&#xD;
the thick garden hedge, intermixed with woodbine,&#xD;
holly and roses, made to her mind, the prettiest fence&#xD;
imaginable-" a thousand times prettier," she said,&#xD;
"than the varnished pickets, that looked like glisten-&#xD;
ing spears around the castle grounds. Why does not&#xD;
my father have such fences ?" she asked. "Because&#xD;
pickets are better to keep out thieves and beggars&#xD;
from the grounds of the rich. We have no fears from&#xD;
robbers, and a hedge secures our gardens quite well&#xD;
enough. Besides, they keep the fowls from our young&#xD;
plants and vegetables."&#xD;
All this was intensely interesting to Marion; and&#xD;
the visit of Dr. Wilkins, in the midst of her enjoy-&#xD;

sent the physician of the family to look after the child,&#xD;
and prescribe her diet, which he made very rigorous&#xD;
indeed. The humane doctor swore more fervently&#xD;
than politely concerning the banishment of her child&#xD;
by Lady Cunningham, which, heartless as it was on&#xD;
her part, was, undoubtedly, as good a thing as could&#xD;
have been done for the welfare of the child, since she&#xD;
had fallen into such kind hands. The daily ride in&#xD;
the cart, about the farm with Mr. Woods, which the&#xD;
doctor advised, was a great delight as well as benefit&#xD;
to her; only marred by her observations on the con-&#xD;
dition of the ten antry; and, young as she was, she&#xD;
was impressed with the natural kindness of heart ma-&#xD;
nifested by a people so shamelessly neglected. She&#xD;
was SlIr1)rised to see that even among her father's&#xD;
tenants, the children had not clothing enough to cover&#xD;
their nakedness. Large boys and girls were run-&#xD;
ning about with no more on them than an old shirt;&#xD;
and, in some cases, children in a state of perfect nudity&#xD;
were amusing themselves cheerfully with the pig&#xD;
or donkey; but, upon perceiving a stranger ran off to&#xD;
hide like rabbits. Sexes were often indistinguishable&#xD;
through dirt and the strange dress worn alike by either.&#xD;
Boys, almost in their teer s~ were clothed in some old&#xD;
under-garment which had belonged to their mothers,&#xD;
and their sisters were no better ofl~ The infant mind&#xD;
of Marion was filled with wonder that such things&#xD;
could exist, while her father talked about the poor,&#xD;
and the duty of landlords. She began to susp~t that&#xD;
the right policy had not yet been fallen upon by the&#xD;
agitators of reform.&#xD;

&#xD;
But, while Marion was being in turn troubled and&#xD;
amused by her new circumstances, there was discon-&#xD;
tent and confusion at the castle. The servants were,&#xD;
as much as they dared be, in a state of revolt, and&#xD;
~annoyed their mistress in all the various ways servants&#xD;
can, while she fretted and threatened in vain. The&#xD;
very parrot seemed in the conspiracy, and constantly&#xD;
rel)eated every sentence of a bad import which she&#xD;
overheard about iMiarion. "IMlarion got the sniall-&#xD;
pOX. Marion will die-sli~'ll die !" screamimed the&#xD;
noisy bird every hour of the day, varied by exclama-&#xD;
tions of "Lady Cunningham's a heathen-d------~---d&#xD;
heathen !" none of which cries could have been very&#xD;
comforting to the irritable lady. The superstitious&#xD;
servants thought the bird had predicted Marion's&#xD;
death, instead of merely repeating what it had over-&#xD;
heard among themselves ; and used more lamenta-&#xD;
tions, which the parrot never failed to repeat, until&#xD;
Lady Cunningham was nearly distractedd and had ft-c-&#xD;
quent fits of fainting, caused by these annoyances.&#xD;
In time mi(lst of this unhappiness, there was an al-ri-&#xD;
val at the castle, of the Duke of Southwiek and two&#xD;
sisters, distant relatives of her ladyship. Time duke&#xD;
had long been on terms of intimate friendship with&#xD;
Lord Cunningham; and, knowing his great affection&#xD;
for his little daughter, was put in a great rage by the&#xD;
accounts lie received, of her mother's heartlessness in&#xD;
4        desiring to sen(l her own child to a pest-house, instead&#xD;
of devoting to her use a part of the castle, sufficiently&#xD;
remote to secure her own safety, if that was of so&#xD;
much importance. The ladies, though they i-c-&#xD;
1)roached Lady Cunningham with cruelty, were still&#xD;

&#xD;
greatly incensed at the poor creature who caused the&#xD;
calamity, and joined her ladyship heartily in her re-&#xD;
pugnance to the poor, and hatred of the Irish poor,&#xD;
in particular. Some of their conversations being&#xD;
overheard by the servants, caused mutterings and dis-&#xD;
respect. Among the most disaffected, was Brooks,&#xD;
who, from long service in titled families, was ac-&#xD;
quainted with many of the scandals of the nobility,&#xD;
and did not hesitate to say that the duke and his sis-&#xD;
ters were of illegitimate birth; and that the ladies,&#xD;
who had such a horror of the poor Irish, were receiv-&#xD;
ing pensions               government of eioi&#xD;

is well known, for what cause the government pen-&#xD;
sions many of these ladies of doubtful birth-a fact&#xD;
for which the Irish owe the English nobility no great&#xD;
love.&#xD;
But, to return to Marion, the time had arrived for&#xD;
the development of the disease. The poor baby was in&#xD;
a state of intense suffering, and she was blind and&#xD;
helpless. her life was despaired of by all her atten-&#xD;
dants except good iDr. Wilkins, whose faithfulness and&#xD;
profound skill probably saved her. The services of&#xD;
Mrs. Woods, and Lucy the nurse, were of no small&#xD;
inmportauc.e. Between these volunteer friends, the lit~&#xD;
the forlorn outcast from her mother's love was re-&#xD;
stored to the hope of health. During Marion's ill-&#xD;
ness, tIme farmer's children, whose hearts she had won&#xD;
by her amiability, inquired often after tIme invalid,&#xD;
and left daises and primroses by the apronful, with&#xD;
Mrs. Wood, in token of their sympathy.. During the&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.         49&#xD;
height of the fever and delirium, the poor little suf-&#xD;
ferer called upon her father frequently, in tones of&#xD;
entreaty, bewailing his absence and her mother's cold-&#xD;
ness, most pitifully.&#xD;
A good constitution and great care triumphed over&#xD;
the disease, and Marion was convalescent. She had&#xD;
received letters and presents also, by the first mail&#xD;
from Canada, and a draft for a considerable amount&#xD;
of money, which she amused herself in portioning out&#xD;
in presents to her humble friends. The doctor, who&#xD;
took a great interest in his little patient, was rejoiced&#xD;
'I&#xD;
at her returning' health and cheerfulness, and took&#xD;
b&#xD;
delight in assisting any of her innocent plans.&#xD;
The doctor was destined to make a discoveryy with&#xD;
regard to her case which was shocking in the&#xD;
extreme. 'On returning home, one afternoon, from a&#xD;
visit to his young patient, while passing by the resi-&#xD;

object-the same woman who had exposed Marion to&#xD;
the dreadful disease she was suffering from-but now&#xD;
in a dying condition. Two men had just brought her&#xD;
to the spot where the doctor encountered the sad sight,&#xD;
and, from them and from her, he learned the history&#xD;
of her wrongs and the infamy of Lord Charles Elia.&#xD;
The poor wretch stated that she lived with her hius-&#xD;
baud on the Ella estate ; and that the pressure of the&#xD;
tii~~s, together with the sickness of their children,&#xD;
who were having the smallpox had made it impossi-&#xD;
ble to pay the rent. In this extremity, Charles Elia&#xD;
had promised her that he would forgive her husband&#xD;
the rent, and secure the place to them for three years&#xD;
more, rent-free, if she would take her children and go&#xD;

begging to certain places for one week. The poor&#xD;
woman could hot help knowing what would be the&#xD;

several could testit~ like Marion; but his part still&#xD;
remained undone. After a few weeks the miserable&#xD;
family had been turned out of doors by the proctor,&#xD;
and the little they possessed was sold.&#xD;
Lord Elia's residence was on an island of Loch&#xD;
Erne, where she had that day been iu order, in some&#xD;
way, to get a message to Lord Charles, hoping he&#xD;
might yet aid her as he had promised. At the&#xD;
entrance of the different avenues leading to the man-&#xD;
sion were little covered kennels or dog-houses, where&#xD;
immense bull-dogs were kept chained to guard the&#xD;
premises from intruders, especially from beggars.&#xD;
She knew the danger of attempting to enter; but,&#xD;
goaded on by her necessities, had taken the risk.&#xD;
Alas, she had not escaped. Those fierce, terrible&#xD;
dogs had almost torn her in pieces. The boatmen&#xD;
who run over produce, had takeii her across, and the&#xD;
watchman or porter had not noticed her arrival out-&#xD;
side the gate; so that there was no one at hand to&#xD;
render her any assistance even if they would have&#xD;
done so; and it was by the merest accident these&#xD;
two men had come in time to save her alive, for these&#xD;
dogs well liked an Irish woman for a lunch, and had&#xD;
quite as little mercy as their masters. The misera-&#xD;
ble woman, torn and dying, had just been brought&#xD;
back, when the doctor met her. lie gave~ her a&#xD;
stimulant, and ordered her carried to her own house&#xD;
&#xD;
where he could examine her wounds. But the proc-&#xD;
tor was there before them and would not yield pos-&#xD;
session. The doctor assured him it was only for a&#xD;
little time she could live. "Then let her die out of&#xD;
doors," answered the wretch; "she cannot come in&#xD;
here, if they all die." The doctor persisted, the&#xD;
proctor stood his ground, and threatened to shoot.&#xD;
At this, the doctor gave him ~ blow with his fist&#xD;
which laid him 1)rostrate, and ordered the husband to&#xD;
carry his wife into the hut; but the woman was dead.&#xD;
Contenting himself with giving the proctor a lecture&#xD;
in addition to his first punishment, the doctor went on&#xD;
his way, meditating upon Charles Ehia's crimes, and&#xD;
what the great may do without endangering their&#xD;
reputations.&#xD;
Doctor Wilkins was a peculiar man. Savage in&#xD;
his looks, he was at heart very kind and benevolent.&#xD;
With a frown he could make a beggar run away&#xD;
from him; and the next moment lie was angry at&#xD;
himself for frowning, and, at the beggar for running,&#xD;
as jf he had anything to fear. lie loved children,&#xD;
and was kind to them. One day, as he was riding&#xD;
along, and talking to himself about something that&#xD;
amused him, he observed a boy and girl standing in&#xD;
the road looking earnestly at hiiimi. As lie ap-&#xD;
proached, the boy took off his ragged hat and made a&#xD;
bow, still without speaking.&#xD;
"What are you looking at?" said lie, gruffly.&#xD;
"At your honor," answered the boy.&#xD;
"Why do you look at me?"&#xD;
"Because you are good-looking," answered the&#xD;
boy, promptly.&#xD;

&#xD;
The doctor laughed heartily, and asked the child&#xD;
his name.&#xD;
"It's me name is Pat Monday, your honor."&#xD;
"What is your father's name&#xD;
"John Monday."&#xD;
"Where do you live ?"&#xD;

"Stop; what does your father do for a living?"&#xD;
"What's that, your honor ?"&#xD;
"What kind of work does lie do ?"&#xD;
" Shiure, lie's in jail !"&#xD;
The doctor recollected that he was on his way to&#xD;
visit a patient; but lie sent the boy with his sister to&#xD;
his house, to get refreshments, and promised to see&#xD;
him again. Such were his ways and acts.&#xD;
The good doctor, with his amusing ways, was a&#xD;
great comfort to Marion during the period of her&#xD;
convalescence. He told her stories, sympathized&#xD;
with her in her childish plans, amid talked with her of&#xD;
her father; for whose return she preferred to wait,&#xD;
before asking permission to take up her residence&#xD;
again at the castle.&#xD;
Lord Cunningham had made a quick passage out&#xD;
to the provinces; an6., having succeeded in transact-&#xD;
ing the mine cessary busimiess in good time, had returned&#xD;
as fi~r as Dublin, whence lie wrote to Brooks to come&#xD;
to him, as he should be detained a few days. It niay&#xD;
have been that tIme man, indignant at the spirit of the&#xD;
administration at the castle, was highly gratified at&#xD;
this opportunity to give his master warning of the&#xD;
condition of his domestic affairs; ceAain it is that,&#xD;
&#xD;
when his lordship caine to understand what had&#xD;
taken place in his absence, lie rested not until he was&#xD;
upon the road; and his journey closed not at his own&#xD;
door, where he had hoped to meet his family united,&#xD;
but at the cottage of farmer Woods. "1 will share&#xD;
my daughter's banishment," lie said, l)itterly ; " Lady&#xD;
Cunningham shall enjoy her tastes unmolested by the&#xD;
presence of husband or child." A note to that eIh~ct&#xD;
had already been sent to her ladyship, when iLord&#xD;
Cunningham, aim ost unannounced, alighted before&#xD;
the cottage of the honest farmer. Marion's still deli-&#xD;
cate nerves were terribly shaken, though it was by&#xD;
joy at this unexpected happiness; and a scene such&#xD;
as will not bear description gave witness to the pain&#xD;
and pleasure of this meeting. One of the strongest&#xD;
proofs that man is an emanation from the divine&#xD;
nature, is the power and grandeur of his emotions,&#xD;
which raise him out of this world aiid time, in love,&#xD;

Up to the receipt of his lordship's letter, Lady Cun-&#xD;

transactions she had been the aggrieved party. "It&#xD;
was bad enough that her husband should have&#xD;
always disregarded her aristocratic tastes, that her&#xD;
child instead of being bred a lady of refinement, was&#xD;
allowed and encouraged in such plebeian habits and&#xD;
ideas as her father seemed resolute to educate her in;&#xD;

actually fainted. When she recovered, her first&#xD;
impulse was to send for Brooks arid dismiss him for&#xD;
impertinent conduct informing upon her actions; but&#xD;
a quiet remark from her cousin, the IDuke of South-&#xD;
wick, that "if his sister would second her ladyship's&#xD;
motion, he would argue it," hinted to her that the&#xD;
matter bad better rest for the present.&#xD;

ChAPTER YR.&#xD;
AFTER a few days of looking up the condition of&#xD;
his estate, Lord Cunningham informed her ladyship&#xD;
by letter, of his intention of going back to Canada,&#xD;
with his daughter, as soon as both were ready, and&#xD;
invited her ladyship to accompany them if she should&#xD;
like to ; otherwise to inform him of' her wishes.&#xD;
Would she reside in Scotland with her relatives?&#xD;
Would she prefer a residence in England, where&#xD;
more congenial associations could be had? Or&#xD;
would she remain in Ireland?&#xD;
Lady Cunningham was not going to accept any&#xD;
overtures in haste, however polite. As for going to&#xD;
Scotland, she would not-nor even to England, though&#xD;
she wished it; nor to the new world, least of all. She&#xD;
would not decide in haste ; but would finally remain&#xD;
in Ireland and make herself as happy as she could&#xD;
with the Elias and other families obnoxious to his&#xD;
lordship. In that way she felt sure of avenging&#xD;
some of the insults put 11~OIl her by him.&#xD;
Accordingly, in reply to his inquiries she "assured&#xD;
Lord Cunningham that she had no present need of&#xD;
his attentions, and would (leCidC for herself wlieii it&#xD;

of his entire thou gl~ts, lest she might suffer from so&#xD;
unusual a deprivation. She was sorry she had not&#xD;

was so devoted to; but for the future, hoped she&#xD;

should be absolved from all responsibility concerning&#xD;
the care of his pock-marked Irish girl, as she was not&#xD;
fond of such extraordinary qualities as she l)os-&#xD;
It would be difficult to tell whether his lordship&#xD;
was most angry or most grieved, at this unfeeling&#xD;
answer. The sooner to forget it he turned his&#xD;
attention to other things. Marion, in her artless yet&#xD;
earnest way, had detailed to him accounts of the pri-&#xD;
vation and degradation she had observed among his&#xD;
tenantry, asking if nobody loved or cared for these&#xD;
wretched people.&#xD;
"I was born in Ireland," she would say, "and so&#xD;
am an Irishwoman, though I am named for a Scotch&#xD;
lady. I wish I could visit Scotland, yet, even if I&#xD;
could, perhaps I should see poor unhappy peol)le there&#xD;
as well as hero, and as this is now my country, I&#xD;
want to do something for these people first. I wish&#xD;
you would tell me what to do, father."&#xD;
Lord Cunningham was as much puzzled with the&#xD;
problem of what to do, as his little girl. Lately, his&#xD;
beautiful Irish estates had lost their charm 'for him.&#xD;
The more acquaintance lie had with them the less he&#xD;
hoped ever to get his people into a more prosperous&#xD;
condition, and while possessing the willingness to act,&#xD;
he hhd not the knowledge needed of the way in&#xD;
which to commence the reform. To give them&#xD;
money would be to send them to buy whisky and&#xD;
fight, for that is the only use they know for money.&#xD;
To distribute clothing amongst them in their present&#xD;
miserable habits of living, would be doing them an&#xD;
unimportant service. To feed them by charity as a&#xD;
&#xD;
common thing would only take away the little dis-&#xD;
position to exertion that they now have, lie would&#xD;
have been glad to have colonized a portion of them,&#xD;
that the remainder might have a better chance to&#xD;
live; but was convinced that it would be no great&#xD;
blessing either to the emigrants or to people of the&#xD;
country to which they might be sent. The poorest&#xD;
part of them were Roman Catholics, entirely under&#xD;
the authority of the priests, and would feel it their&#xD;
duty to promote the cause of their religion, which in&#xD;
a Protestant community would occasion ill-feeling.&#xD;
Besides, it had always been preached to them that it&#xD;
was their blessed privilege to be poor and ragged.&#xD;
All denominations join in declaring that God makes&#xD;
the rich man rich and the poor man poor. This sort&#xD;
of sentiment is not the one with which to enter upon&#xD;
a new life in a new and thriving country.&#xD;
Neither would they be a good element in a coun-&#xD;
try like the United States, for another reason. They&#xD;
are so used to be bought and sold in their own elec-&#xD;
tions when they have any voice in such occasion~,&#xD;
and to be of whatever politics their masters arc, and&#xD;
to cry God save the king, whether sincere or not,&#xD;
that they would be apt to prove in a republican&#xD;
government a powerful force in the hands of demago-&#xD;
gues, or any corrupt political tricksters. The prac-&#xD;
tices of their lords are often so inimnoral and the&#xD;
temptations held out to them to assist in the imumo-&#xD;
rahities so great, that they seldom have the courage to&#xD;
resist them. Indeed compliance is often a neces8?tg,&#xD;
since the landlords threaten them with a discontinu-&#xD;
ance of their leases unless they bring in as large a&#xD;

&#xD;
vote as possible. Consequently they are little accus-&#xD;
tomed to think for themselves, or to appreciate the&#xD;
advantage of a change in their condition; and if their&#xD;
attacbmnent to their native soil could be overcome,&#xD;
which is doubtful, they would be likely to be&#xD;
unhappy under circumstan ces requiring of them an&#xD;
intellectual eSertion beyond their abilities.&#xD;
Thins while Lord Cunningham desired to settle&#xD;
upon something to make a permanent and beneficial&#xD;
change on his estate, lie was tossed about by doubts&#xD;
and misgivings.&#xD;
The lease which Mr. Woods held was nearly ex-&#xD;
pired, and Lord Cunningham resolved to renew it,&#xD;
rent free, forever, in consideration of his kindness&#xD;
toward Marion. Mr. Woods had a son, a line lad,&#xD;
who was going to be apprenticed to Dr. Wilkins; but~&#xD;
who showed so great a desire for travel, and possessed&#xD;
so much intelligence for his age and condition, that&#xD;
his lordship's heart warmed toward the boy, and lie&#xD;
resolved to take him to Canada, if his father made no&#xD;
objections. Objections were made, but overruled by&#xD;
the lad, whose imagination could conceive of nothing&#xD;
finer than a voyage like that. So it was settled lie&#xD;
should go. Wliemi his lordship asked Marion how she&#xD;
should like to have John Woods of their party, Jie an-&#xD;
swered, " very much indeed I can then have a page."&#xD;
"A page, my dear! and at your age! I fear John&#xD;
will object to playing page to ami eight-year-old young&#xD;
lady: he would sooner be an esquire to a lady of nine-&#xD;
teen."&#xD;
"When I am nineteen, then, I shall have John for&#xD;
my esquire."&#xD;
&#xD;
"IDo YOU admire John so much, then ~" asked his&#xD;
lordship.&#xD;
"I like him better than anybody I know, excepting&#xD;
you, and nurse, and Dr. Wilkins ; and I think he is the&#xD;
handsomest boy in the neighborhood. Do you not&#xD;
think lie looks like the son of a lord ?" asked Marion,&#xD;
earnestly.&#xD;
"No," answered Lord Cunningham laughing, "he&#xD;
looks quite too clever."&#xD;
Though Marion did not understand this reason very&#xD;
well, she was satisfied with it, and delighted at the&#xD;
prospect of John for a companion, for she had no&#xD;
doubt it was as a companion to her he was to go.&#xD;
No better one could have been chosen, after her father&#xD;
and the nurse; for John's gaiety, amiability and intel-&#xD;
li gence were a great help to the rather feeble spirits&#xD;
of the child, at that time.&#xD;
The painful separation from her mother weighed on&#xD;
the little girl's heart. Cold as her mother had been,&#xD;
she had loved her with the natural love of childhood&#xD;
for its payment; and regarded her, beside, as the pret-&#xD;
tiest lady that she knew. Lady Cunningham was,&#xD;
indeed, a handsome woman, and children are pleased&#xD;
with beauty. She was fond of her father and grate.&#xD;
ful for the increased kindness by which he endeavored&#xD;
to make up for her loss of a ffiother; but, she was not&#xD;
able fully to comprehend the feelings of resentment&#xD;
which Lord Cunningham conceived it ahnost a duty&#xD;
to entertain. The j udici6us course which her nurse&#xD;
had always pursued, in trying to smooth over the&#xD;
asperities of Lady Cunningham's disposition, had pre-&#xD;
served the tender sentiments of childhood fresh in the&#xD;

child's heart. Always ready with an apology, when&#xD;
some impatience had grieved her little heart, Lucy&#xD;
had again and again assured her charge that her&#xD;
mother was ill ; *or, perhaps, had not been scolded&#xD;
when she was a child, and did not know that it&#xD;
pained othei's to be reproved; awl so on, and so on-&#xD;
always ready with an excuse, until the little girl really&#xD;
regarded her mother as a person needing pity, and&#xD;
was willing at any time to extend her own love and&#xD;
compassion, should it ever prove acceptable.&#xD;
Marion longed to ask her father to take her to the&#xD;
castle Once, before ,going to America; but; intimate&#xD;
as she was with him, and much as she was indulged,&#xD;
she could not approach him on this subject. After&#xD;
a vain attempt on one Or two occasions, she gave&#xD;
up the hope in silent melancholy. Perhaps Lord&#xD;
Cunningham thought to make the mother solicit an&#xD;
interview with her outcast dan ghter, but he cherished&#xD;
vain hopes in that regard.&#xD;
Ireland was looking like a paradise during the last&#xD;
weeks of their lingering. Nature, always lavish of&#xD;
her verdure and flowers in the "green isle," was wear-&#xD;
ing her loveliest colors then. The fields, spangled&#xD;
with daisies, with bouquets of primroses and daffodils,&#xD;
were in their mnost beautiful season: the hedges were&#xD;
in their glory; and the low mountain ranges to the&#xD;
south and east, formed a suitable frame for the pic-&#xD;
ture of bounteous loveliness which it inclosed. The&#xD;
sheep On the hills, the cattle in the meadows, the&#xD;
children at their play, half naked as they were, were&#xD;
all suggestive of peace and contentment. Indeed,&#xD;
discontent is not a distinguishing trait of the Irish&#xD;

that is felt to be oppressive to the aristocratic sense.&#xD;
At last, the final adieux were made, and the coach&#xD;
conveyed them to Enniskillen. At Enniskillen&#xD;
they made a short stay to give the young folks,&#xD;
John and Marion, an opportunity of seeing some&#xD;
things whicl they had read about; among others,&#xD;
the 01(1 castle that still bears some records, on its&#xD;
moldering stones, of the times of 1688, when James&#xD;
II. was urging a war of extermination against the&#xD;
Protestants. here they sat down and talked over&#xD;
the memorable events of that time, and sympathized&#xD;
with those brave men and women who endured every&#xD;
suffering that humanity is capal)le of, in the sieges&#xD;
of their cities, especially at Londonderry. Enniskil-&#xD;

very high hills in its vicinity, from which a better&#xD;

"What if somebody in Canada should ask me&#xD;

"Should you tell them what you have seen, they&#xD;
will find an explanation for themselves," answered&#xD;
her father.&#xD;
"But they might not get tile rigllt reason, after&#xD;
all," continued Marion.&#xD;
Well, then, my daughter," said his lordship, with&#xD;
a smile' "one reason of so uluch misery among the&#xD;

(34      THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL;&#xD;
&#xD;
Marion, who noticed that her father put an empha-&#xD;
sis upon the word page, and remembered her propo-&#xD;
sition to have John Woods for that office, could not&#xD;
help feeling conscious of being rebuked, and dreaded&#xD;
lest he should mention it before John. He was quite&#xD;
satisfied to have teased her a little; and she asked no&#xD;
more questions about inequality of riches.&#xD;
But the knowh~dge of tImings, sadder even than&#xD;
poverty, were pressing upon the youthful lady. It&#xD;
happened while they were at Enniskillep that the&#xD;
execution of seven criminals, and the transportation of&#xD;
thirty more wei~e to take place. The town was hav-&#xD;
ing a holiday on account of this melancholy event.&#xD;
All classes seemed to partake in the excitement.&#xD;
iLord Cunningham was pained to learn that one of&#xD;
tIme criminals about to suffer death, was one Gabbat,&#xD;
an amiable young man, who had been* his guest at&#xD;
the time oYMarion's christening. His lordship took&#xD;
some pamils to ascertain the particulars of hi~ crime&#xD;
and irmisfortune.&#xD;
It appeared, upon inquiry into the young man's&#xD;
history, that an unequal marriage-that fruitful&#xD;
source of domestic misery in Great Britain-had been&#xD;
the first cause of the poor fellow's bad ending. lie&#xD;
had followed .a fancy for the daughter of his father's&#xD;
footman; and, finding her virtuous, had married her.&#xD;
As a consequence, he had been turned off without a&#xD;
~shilling. Without money or a knowledge of any&#xD;
kind of business, and not being able to do hard labor,&#xD;
Gabbat found it next to impossible to live; but for&#xD;
the exertions of his more experienced wife, he would&#xD;
have been forced to starve. Taunted h)y his father.&#xD;

who was determined to make him an example to the&#xD;
other children-hired by his own brothers to (10&#xD;
ditching, and, in every way humiliated, he was not&#xD;
long in making up his mind to have money, by fitir&#xD;
means or foul. Money, he had learned, was the&#xD;
lever which moves society, and money he would yet&#xD;
obtain, in spite of his father's hardness toward&#xD;
him.&#xD;
As the easiest beginning, lie invested what means&#xD;
lie could borrow from his father-in-law, in a genteel&#xD;
establishment for the sale of liqnors, and playing of&#xD;
games. By the same means he had known of others&#xD;
making fortunes; and, if his high breeding sometimes&#xD;
revolted, lie remembered it was quite as respectable as&#xD;
hard labor amid more remunerative. lie meant, too, to&#xD;
make some money at play, though he knew that, for&#xD;
a pour man to do this, was a high offence against&#xD;
good morals and good order. lie had often played&#xD;
with the clergyman who baptized him, and had made&#xD;
up his mind to think it quite as honorable to play&#xD;
with sporting men as mimiisters, even though a minis-&#xD;
ter's winnings were usually considered sacred, like&#xD;
his tithes. So poor Gabbat set up for himself in this&#xD;
rather dubious business, and, by practice, soon be-&#xD;
came an expert player; but his generosity and&#xD;
nubusinesshike habits prevented the rapid acquisition&#xD;
of fortune lie had lmopcd for.&#xD;
He used to tell an anecdote of his family to his&#xD;
associates, in illustration of the family talent for play.&#xD;
His grandfather had played with the Bislm )~ of Dren-&#xD;
mare for his daughter, to give to his son, and had&#xD;
won her; and she, being of higher family than the&#xD;

Gabliats, had been of great benefit to the connec-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
So much for play ! But all its events arc not so&#xD;
happy. Gabbat had an associate named Stinson,&#xD;
who was a good player, and a shrewd, unj)rineipled&#xD;
fellow. Whenever his fricud had bcen fortunate&#xD;
with others, and had any money on hand, Stinson&#xD;
was sure to know it~ and pretty sure to win a portion&#xD;
of it a~vay roin him.&#xD;
One evening, liavin g just won quite a large sum,&#xD;
and feeling himself on the road to fortune more&#xD;
surely than ever before, Gabbat was asked to play by&#xD;
his wily friend, Stinson. For some time, Stinson&#xD;
lost, but when the liquor circulated a little more&#xD;
freely, had a new turn of luck, and won not only&#xD;
what he had lost, but all that Gabbat had won for&#xD;
some time. having nothing to go on with, the ganie&#xD;
was closed for the night. Stinson had allowed him-&#xD;
self to become very much intoxicated, and knowing&#xD;
that he could not pass the guards in that condition,&#xD;
Gabbat offered him a bed in his house, which was&#xD;
accepted.&#xD;
When the house was quite still, the disappointed&#xD;
young man sat down to reflect upon his losses. The&#xD;
more he thought upon them, the more he felt unable&#xD;
to endure them. Then came the temptation to take&#xD;
back his money while Stinson slept. His intoxicated&#xD;
condition led Gabbat to think that he would not&#xD;
remember the events of the evening, nor miss the&#xD;
money he had won while under the influence of&#xD;
liquor. In vain his wife entreated him to go to&#xD;
bed; still he sat brooding~; and when he thought&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        67&#xD;
&#xD;
she, too, was asleep, entered his guest's room&#xD;
softly, and succeeded in getting possession of the lost&#xD;
riches. Perceiving that there was something over,&#xD;
he was stopping to replace that, when Stinson 511(1-&#xD;
denly awakened, quite sober, and sprang out of bed&#xD;
in alarm, thinking perhaps he was going to be mur-&#xD;
dered. In the struggle which ensued, Gabbat cried&#xD;
out to his wife that he should be killed; and she, not&#xD;
knowing the cause of the assault, ran to his rescue&#xD;
with a loaded butt, with which she struck Stinson upon&#xD;
the head a number of times, until the unfortunate&#xD;
man fell lifeless upon the floor. Overcome by emo-&#xD;
tions of the most painful nature, the wife fainted beside&#xD;
her victim, while her husband, perceiving the danger&#xD;
of his situation, immediately fled, leaving her to her&#xD;
fate. It was a melancholy one indeed. Upon awaken-&#xD;
ing and finding herself lying in the blood of the mur-&#xD;
dered man, the poor woman lost her reason entirely,&#xD;
and became a raving maniac. The police that were&#xD;
set upon the search for Gabbat were not long in dis-&#xD;
covering his whereabouts, and. he was now about to&#xD;
suffer the penalty of crime. His family utterly&#xD;
abandoned him as unworthy their compassion; and&#xD;
upon the father and mother of the poor crazed wife&#xD;
fell not only the sorrow, but the blame. "had he&#xD;
not married a low person," says aristocracy, "he&#xD;
would never have met with such ~ fate. Poverty&#xD;
and crime are always united;. if one ever hears of a&#xD;
person of no consequence doing well, it is through&#xD;

ideas, whose protection saved them from following&#xD;

"Why, then," it might be asked, "is not this&#xD;
charity more frequently extended; and why is it&#xD;
withheld from your own sons or daughters who have&#xD;
dared to go athwart your desires or opinions ?"&#xD;
This pitiful story of poor Gabbat gave Thrd Cun-&#xD;
ningham but little inclination to prolong his stay in&#xD;
that vicinity, and hurrying on to Dublin, he has-&#xD;
tened to put hanging, transporting, poverty, crime,&#xD;
poverty-suffering, riches, responsibility all out of&#xD;
his mind, by embarking on board a ship bound 'for&#xD;
Halifax. But he could not so easily settle the ques-&#xD;
tion which haunted him; "how could Sir James&#xD;
Gabbat reconcile his own avowed belief; and his pro-&#xD;
fessions of religious feeling, with his conduct toward&#xD;
his son ?" Often had the old man reproved Gun-'&#xD;
niughamn for neglecting to teach the doctrines of&#xD;
religion to his daughter, young as she was. He&#xD;
never failed to say "by God's leave," in making an&#xD;
appointment, and ~vent through with all religious&#xD;
observances with regularity. He was, too, a pleasant-&#xD;
spoken and apparently kind-hearted man; yet, when&#xD;
his own son was in prison, as the result of dis-&#xD;
obedience to Aim, he refused to go near, saying "he&#xD;
respected society; and if his son had violated its&#xD;
laws, he must suffer the consequences without inter-&#xD;
ference; for his part, he desired to see the guilty&#xD;
punished, even though it was his own flesh and&#xD;
blood." Did the old man all this time forget that,&#xD;
but a few years previous, he had followed an offimd-&#xD;

chamber where the frightened creature had fled for&#xD;
refuge, and~ struck him down dead before her eyes;&#xD;

and then had taken refuge behind that English law&#xD;
which says "a man may kill another man whom he&#xD;
finds in his wife's bed ;" allowing the scandal to go&#xD;
out about his own wife, rather than suffer justice in&#xD;
person.&#xD;
Verily, this self-righteousness is horribly repulsive&#xD;
to a candid nature. It argues, in itself, something mo-&#xD;
rally wrong in the possessor.&#xD;
Ireland has faded from sight of the voyagers, and&#xD;
with it are banished from remembrance her social sins&#xD;
as well as her physical sufferings. Late events had&#xD;
conspired to give Lord Cunningham's mind at one of&#xD;
sadness; and the conversation of some of the American&#xD;
passengers was not calculated to soothe a man already&#xD;
irritable from the action of causes to which these talk-&#xD;
ative strangers were constantly ret'erring. Gradually,&#xD;
however, the conversation of John and Marion began&#xD;
to draw his attention and interest: and the more they&#xD;
observed his returning cheerfulness, the more they&#xD;
endeavored to amuse him. Marion had by nature a&#xD;
playful disposition, and when allowed to piii'~iC it,&#xD;
often engaged in frolic. These exhibitions of animal&#xD;
spirit gave the good Lucy sonic trouble ; inasmuch&#xD;
as she considered herself responsible for the correct&#xD;
deportment, and lady-like manners of her young&#xD;
charge. Seeing the apparent carelessness of his lord-&#xD;
ship, she had all the more anxiety. But good Lucy&#xD;
need not have feared for Lord Cunningham's daugh-&#xD;
ter: he was never so forgetful that lie did not regard&#xD;
her words and actions, and she very well knew the&#xD;
expression of his eye, which said "hold, enough !"&#xD;
Lucy thought it somewhat singular too, that his lord-&#xD;

ship could witness the growing attachment of his&#xD;
daughter for the handsome farmer's son, without&#xD;
apprehending the danger of future consequences.&#xD;
Whatever Cunningham thought, the extreme youth&#xD;
of Marion was no guaranty: she had known children&#xD;

lowed unrestrained freedom of intercourse. If he&#xD;
wanted to avoid a misalliance for his daughter, he&#xD;
must take a different course with her, and teach her&#xD;
greater distinction of rank.&#xD;
Whatev5 the father thought on the subject, he&#xD;
said nothing, nor did he alter his management.&#xD;
Marion continued to take delight in the boy's com-&#xD;

him like a lord, and now like a servant, but every&#xD;
way with the greatest affection.&#xD;

DURING the voyage, which was a pleasant erie,&#xD;
Lady Cimninghain was cherishing her wrath in lone-&#xD;

temper prevented d her own enjoyment, quite as much&#xD;
as that of others-or even more: for it is impossible&#xD;
for evil thoughts to escape from themselves. The&#xD;
displeasure which Lord Cunningham had shown in&#xD;
so marked and public a manner had truly been a&#xD;
great trial to her ladyship's pride-none the easier' to&#xD;
bear, for. having been deserved. In vain she says to&#xD;
herself, she is not a servitor of public opinion ; in&#xD;
vain she declares that no one shall teach her her&#xD;
duty; she is nevertheless miserably sensitive to the&#xD;
horror of being esteemed a monster of cruelty, and&#xD;
resents the means employed for her humiliation more&#xD;
than if it had been corporeal punishment.&#xD;
In the mean time, Lord Charles Elia was gloating&#xD;

were more than fulfilling themselves; since not only&#xD;
Marion's disfigurement, but the estrangement of his&#xD;

quiring after his lordship, who, he said, he had been&#xD;
told, had returned from his voyage to America. Quite&#xD;
deceived by the scoundrel's palavei', Lady Cunning-&#xD;
ham explained his coning and departure; and was&#xD;
lcd on insensibly step by step, by artful questions, to&#xD;
divulge the whole story of her difficulties with his&#xD;
lordship. She was suffered to believe herself the&#xD;
most injured and most tenderly sympathized-with&#xD;
woman in the world. lie spoke kindly and affec-&#xD;
tionately of Marion, in whom he had a godfather's&#xD;
interest; reprovingly of Lord Cunningham, who had&#xD;
so unjustly brought blame upon a lady of her known&#xD;
amiability of character. In his flatteries, Lord Elia&#xD;
Was very prudent; for no one ever doubted the&#xD;
chastity and modesty of Lady Cunningham's mind.&#xD;
He only wanted to make an impression that she&#xD;
had no more anxious or tender personal friend than&#xD;
himself; and, poor lady! she felt herself so much&#xD;
in need of friendship, that she was all the more&#xD;
easily misled as to the character of this villain's mo-&#xD;
tives. Lord Ehia hoped that Lady Cuniiinghiam&#xD;
would renew her acquaintance with his mother,&#xD;
now that she was so much at liberty; and her lady-&#xD;
ship promised; not only because she had resolved to&#xD;
be intimate with the Ehia family, but because Lady&#xD;
Elia was really a lovely woman, and, in the present&#xD;
softened state of her feelings, she longed for some&#xD;
coml)anionship.&#xD;
When, by many arts and blandishments, Lord&#xD;
Charles Elia had succeeded in gaining the perfect&#xD;
confidence of the unhappy, but not suspicious or art-&#xD;
ful lady, lie began to create for her a new cause of&#xD;

uneasiness. Having heard of the lad Woods who&#xD;
had accompanied Lord Cunningham abroad, he care-&#xD;
lessly at first, and seriously afterward, announced&#xD;
his belief that it was his lordship's intention to edi-&#xD;
cate this young man, and give him his daughter in&#xD;
marriage. He gave good reasons for such a conjec-&#xD;
ture, and, at last, ~ncceeded in convincing Lady C.&#xD;
of the probability of this scheme-matrimonial. "it&#xD;
comported," she said, "with his character in gene-&#xD;
ral, to prefer an alliance for his daughter of this sort;&#xD;
rather than one of a proper, or more respectable rank.&#xD;
He had insisted on making his daughter a plain and&#xD;
humdrum, common sort of girl, instead of bringing&#xD;
her up according to her position in society; and now&#xD;
it would doubtless turn out that he ~vould marry her&#xD;
to a commoner, perhaps to a beggar." But the more&#xD;
Lady Cunningham thought of the probability of such&#xD;
an event, the more she resolved it never should hap-&#xD;
pen. She Itad some interest in her own child, and&#xD;
that was to see that she did not humble her mother&#xD;
by a low connection.&#xD;
Thus did Elia succeed in fermenting other discords&#xD;
in the family of the detested lord, who had had the&#xD;
temerity to interfere between him and helpless,&#xD;
injured womanhood. The affair of Mary Fowler soon&#xD;
passed out of the minds of those who had once been&#xD;
cognizant of it; and the popularity of the Elias was&#xD;
no longer affected by it. Indeed, such is the truth&#xD;
of the proverb-" kissing goes by favor "-that it&#xD;
was now Lord Fowler instead of Lord Ella who was&#xD;
out of favor with the aristocracy, partly on account&#xD;
of having asked for the repeal of certain laws whieh&#xD;

he felt to be a disgrace to the nation; but more&#xD;
because the aristocrats could not forgive his conces-&#xD;
sions in favor of his "low-minded" son. however&#xD;
much some just-minded persons might regret the lax&#xD;
morals of a great portion of the peerage, to admit that&#xD;
they ought to be put upon an equality with common-&#xD;
ers, even in the matter of punishment for crime, would&#xD;
be to establish a dangerous precedent; not more&#xD;
dangerous, however, than that of receiving upon&#xD;
equal teritis the children of the lower classes, who&#xD;
had some good blood in their veins. The principle&#xD;
waN to keep the blood of the peerage pure; their&#xD;
moral were not of so much consequence.&#xD;
Whatever faults Lady Cunningham was possessed&#xD;
of, the circumstances of her marriage with Lord C.&#xD;
did slightly extenuate, even to his lordship, who was,&#xD;
by all means, the greatest sufferer. Lord C. was not&#xD;
her heart's choice, but accepted upon compulsion,&#xD;
when her heart was bruised and bleeding from a cruel&#xD;
wound, whether inflicted purposely by her father, or&#xD;
the decree of Providence, she never felt assured.&#xD;
Upon tIme field of Waterloo, a friend of her father's-&#xD;
Forney by name-received his death-hurt, and in his&#xD;
last moments bequeathed the care of his young son, a&#xD;
lad of twelve years, to his best and most confidential&#xD;
friend. The young Abdell Forney, a gentleman by&#xD;
birth, and heir of a handsome fortune, was received&#xD;
with great kindness, and treated as a son, by his guar-&#xD;
dian. Lady Marga~m'et was of nearly equal years, amid&#xD;
the friendship of childhood ripened into a warmer&#xD;
attachment as the young people arrived at years&#xD;
of romance together. Indeed, there seemed no obsta-&#xD;
&#xD;
cle in the way of their union; so they affianced them-&#xD;
selves, and rested secure in the prospect of consuinma-&#xD;
ting their wishes at some early future day. But all&#xD;
at once, Lady Margaret's father n~ade the discovery&#xD;
that his ward would be without fortune, and forbade&#xD;
the lovers thinking any further of marriage. The&#xD;
blow fell heavily upon both of them ; for they under-&#xD;
stood how useless are appeals from time parties most&#xD;
interested in cases like.this. Youmyg Forney was sent&#xD;
away on some pretence; a measure which resulted in&#xD;
a dangerous illness to Lady Margaret. But the&#xD;
father was ineXoral)lC, and upon her convalescence&#xD;
immediately introduced to her Lord Charles Cunning-&#xD;
ham, as her future husband. Time greatness and sud-&#xD;
denness of the blow which had fallen upon her, seemed&#xD;
to have stupefied her faculties for the time, and she&#xD;
made no resistance to 'her fate. Neither would&#xD;
resistance have benefited her, as the whereabouts of&#xD;
her lover was unknown to her, and even the last*&#xD;
resort, of an elopement, was out of her powel.. Ere&#xD;

of her feelings, was entirely unprepared for the man-&#xD;
ncr in which she received his demonstrations of&#xD;

state of her own mind, until in making time effort to&#xD;
overcome her repugnance, she aroused herself to a&#xD;

supposed she had become, but a woman, with a bit-&#xD;
ter sense of' injury rankling in her soul, and a heart&#xD;
pining for release from the fetters imposed upon her.&#xD;
She was foolish enough to say many things which&#xD;
reflected unjustly upon Lord Cunningham, who was&#xD;
in no wise to blame; and which had the effect of&#xD;
wounding and estranging him, without procuring her&#xD;
any benefits. Yet, with a strange contradictoriness,&#xD;
she resented the coldness she had provoked; and&#xD;
really exacted such marks of attachment as would&#xD;
have satisfied the most tender and jealous wife.&#xD;
Lord Cunningham, out of a generous pity for her&#xD;
unhappiness, had systematically carried himself in&#xD;
such a manner as to avoid giving her pain; though,&#xD;
as her fickleness of temper increased, lie found him-&#xD;
self obliged to exercise his own views of right occa-&#xD;
sionally where they conflicted with hers. Domestic&#xD;
unhappiness increased with every month; for it is an&#xD;
unalterable rule that the more selfishness and injus-&#xD;
tice are indulged, the more exacting and unreason-&#xD;
able they become. Any man less generous or for-&#xD;
bearing would have thrown off entirely all effort to&#xD;
conciliate this captious and uneasy disposition; but,&#xD;
pity for her weakness and her sorrows had obtained&#xD;
for her every indulgence except the one of extending&#xD;
her caprice and want of affection to her child. On&#xD;
that rock, their forced and unnatural union split.&#xD;
Notwithstanding her own experience, Lady Cunning-&#xD;
ham would have pursued the same tyrannical course&#xD;
that had ruined her happiness; so true is it that&#xD;
despotic parents make despotic children-that the&#xD;
wrongs of one generation revenge themselves on the&#xD;
next.&#xD;

OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
HArPILY oblivious of the jealousy and malice at&#xD;
work against him at home, Lord Cunningham arrived&#xD;
safely at Quebec, where he met many familiar faces.&#xD;
Some of them lie ~vas surprised at meeting, for he&#xD;
was aware of no cause which could have called them&#xD;
away from the mother country. Others were there on&#xD;
legitimate business; but a certain social phase,&#xD;
entirely unexpected by him, presented itself to his&#xD;
notice, which on his first hasty visit had been un-&#xD;
known to him. lie was justingly accused of having&#xD;
left Lady Cunningham to take his freedom in the&#xD;
Canadas, and upon inquiry and observation it&#xD;
appeared that he was only suspected because the fact&#xD;
was one of frequent occurrence, even among men of&#xD;
rank and fortune. iNiany temporary marriages had&#xD;
taken place, and some were cases of permanent&#xD;
desertion of wives and families at home to enjoy the&#xD;
society of some more beloved woman, which the&#xD;
social customs of Great Britian would not have&#xD;
allowed them to marry, even had they been free.&#xD;
An Irish gentleman from Fermanagh County, lire-&#xD;
land, was one of the first acquaintances Cunningham&#xD;
saw in public, and he was surprised at what was evi-&#xD;
dently the gentleman's reluctance to meet him.&#xD;
Upon his arm was a fine-looking woman of genteel&#xD;
carriage, whom he presumed to be his wife, though&#xD;
he was unacquainted with her. Not long after get-&#xD;

ting this glimpse of his old acquaintance, his lord-&#xD;
ship received a call from him and heard the explana-&#xD;
tion of the avoidance at their first meeting. The&#xD;
lady was one he had married in this country,&#xD;
although his first wife was still living at home in&#xD;
ignorance of the connection. She was a woman he&#xD;
had never loved-whom, in fact, he disliked, but to&#xD;
whom he had been married by his parents on account&#xD;
of her immense wealth. Finding himself more&#xD;
miserable than he cared to acknowledge, he had&#xD;
made som9 business in the province and came here&#xD;
to get away from the presence of his wife, leaving&#xD;
her in the enjoyment of her wealth and own peculiar&#xD;
tastes. At first he had no intention of making&#xD;
another connection; but becoming acquainted with&#xD;
this lady whom his lordship had seen, he found he&#xD;
was still capable of loving ardently, and had married&#xD;
her as she supposed honorably and legally. Occa-&#xD;
sionally he visited Ireland for a few months, but&#xD;
most of his time was spent here in the enjoyment of&#xD;
his stolen and unsanctified happiness.&#xD;
Here was another development of the workings&#xD;
of a system of marriages by rank or wealth! Cun-&#xD;
ningham was shocked to discover how many English,&#xD;
Jrish and Scotch were guilty of the same departure&#xD;
from civil and religious law. In vajn he made&#xD;
appeals to the sense of moral obligations, taken on&#xD;
with the marriage relation; in nearly every instance&#xD;
they declared themselves irresponsible agents in tho'&#xD;
matter of their original contracts, and only bound by&#xD;
conscience to keep one made freely and with their&#xD;
own approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        79&#xD;
Lord Cunningham thought of Lady Margaret, and&#xD;
sighed.&#xD;
Nd all the excuses made by these men, of wrongs&#xD;
endured at the llan(IS of parents, wives, mothers-hi-&#xD;
law, or other relatives, served to convince Lord Cnn-&#xD;
niughain of the correctness of such practices. Its&#xD;
moral effect, sooner or later, would he most seriously&#xD;
felt, lie longed, too, to enlighten the innocent native&#xD;
girls, who were drawn into these unlawful bonds,&#xD;
blindly. Yet he ~~frained~~thinking the evil was&#xD;
one no interference of his could now cure, although&#xD;
it might hasten on unforeseen disasters in which they&#xD;
would be overwhelmed along with their guilty de-&#xD;
ceivers.&#xD;
A worse thing even than this came under his&#xD;
observation shortly after his conversation with -&#xD;
of Ireland. While walking in one of the fashion-&#xD;
able streets, he met a Miss M-, daughter of an&#xD;
English gentleman whom he had known well a few&#xD;
years before. Miss M-, ~as very fashionably&#xD;
dressed, and at first he accosted her, thinking she&#xD;
might be the wife of some gentleman residing in that&#xD;
country; but, her embarrassment at being recognized&#xD;
led him to make inquiries, and finally her history&#xD;
became known to him. A difficulty with her father,&#xD;
arising from her refusal to accept of a husband she&#xD;
despised, had occasioned her banishment to Canada,&#xD;
where she arrived without money or friemids. It&#xD;
being well known in Canada that many women&#xD;
guilty of crimes are sent, or escape to that country,&#xD;
the fact of her arrival, friendless and in want, instead&#xD;
of exciting compassion, operated against her. Her&#xD;
&#xD;

80       TE ROMANCE OF AN IRISh GIRL;&#xD;
&#xD;
beauty and good-breeding were another evidence&#xD;
against her. Indeed, it appeared upon investigation,&#xD;
that very few girls of the latter sort escaped the fate&#xD;
which befell Miss M-&#xD;
At first she found work in a farmer's family, having&#xD;
been rejected in town. Here it turned out, as might&#xD;
have been expected, that her superior manners&#xD;
excited the jealousy of the women and the admira-&#xD;
tion of the men. The man at whose house she&#xD;
worked, commenced by treating her With more defer-&#xD;
ence than an ordinary rough country girl. His wife's&#xD;
jealousy took the opposite course. He paid Miss&#xD;
more attention than ever. She scolded&#xD;
both him and Miss M-. Miss M- cried,&#xD;
and lie took her part. She was more furious than&#xD;
ever, and declared her husband was false to her.&#xD;
Hereupon there was a general misunderstanding,&#xD;
and Miss M- left her temporary home in des-&#xD;
pair.&#xD;
After this inauspicious beginning, Miss M-~---&#xD;
made several ineffectual attempts to obtain employ-&#xD;
ment. The suspicion of being "no better than she&#xD;
should be," which was strengthened by the unfortu-&#xD;
nate d6no~iment of her service at his place, prevented&#xD;
her being received in~to families, and helpless and not&#xD;
knowing what to do, she did the worst thing she&#xD;
could have done, because it was the only alternative&#xD;
offered. When it is remnein bered that the human&#xD;
life will not long hold out against hunger, that ban-&#xD;
ishment from home, the suspicion of strangers and&#xD;
the persuasions of a libertine combined, make up a&#xD;
pretty strong argument, it is hoped the poor outcast&#xD;

will not be set down as hopelessly depraved from the&#xD;
first. The history of Miss M- is that of hun-&#xD;
dreds whose names ought to be other than Cypri-&#xD;
enfle.&#xD;
In. reply to Lord Cunningham's remonstrance5, and&#xD;
offers of help to live a better life, the lost girl answered&#xD;
that ~he had lost her confidence in human nature, and&#xD;
doubted it was ever intended she should live happily&#xD;
and virtuously. If so, why did her father cast her&#xD;
upon the world in the way he did? Did he not know&#xD;
the probable end? God, who made her, suffered it.&#xD;
People whom she knew talked very piously of the&#xD;
sons and daughters of want and sorrow, yet never&#xD;
soiled their dainty fingers, restraining one from vice&#xD;
or the other from ruin. With quiet force, they held&#xD;
the poor wretches down to their doom; then sancti-&#xD;
moniously concluded that "if they had done right,&#xD;
they would have come out right in the~ end." She&#xD;
had gone to a minister of the Gospel in her days of&#xD;
greatest want, and told him all her cruel story, and&#xD;
begged him to give her work to keep her from hun-&#xD;
ger or shame; and had been told that it would be an&#xD;
injury to the cause of Christ to have her in his family,&#xD;
as people were so suspicious. She then begged his&#xD;
aid in finding a respectable home. ile advised her&#xD;
to repent of her s~n5, and pray much. Such was&#xD;
his care for her soul !-such was the ear the world&#xD;
gave her, body and soul! No, she would not repent&#xD;
noW. She had been compelled to this; Christian&#xD;
women bad been as heartless to her as stone; now&#xD;
she had her revenge in corrupting their husbands.&#xD;
At all this terrible talk, Cunningham was grievously&#xD;

shocked. As a last test, he offered to write to her&#xD;
former lover a history of her case, and make an ap-&#xD;
peal to his affection to come and rescue her. The&#xD;
poor girl was distracted with this promise, and her&#xD;
mental struggles between shame and love, hope aud&#xD;
despair, were afflicting to witness. But she entered&#xD;
into an engagement to live in virtuous seclusion for a&#xD;
period of time sufficient to allow of the proposed cor-&#xD;
respondence; and, to the credit of humanity be it&#xD;
spoken, her lover, with full knowledge of her sins and&#xD;
their cause, sent her his promise to come for her at&#xD;
the end of one year, which she was to devote to&#xD;
moral purification and preparation for marriage-a&#xD;
promise which he kept. The parties took up their&#xD;
residence in another part of Canada.&#xD;
Lord Cunningham had seen the landing of some of&#xD;
his emigrants. Poor creatures! He almost re-&#xD;
pented having induced them to make the experi-&#xD;
ment. Here he obtained his first experimental&#xD;
knowledge of an emigrant ship, and great was his&#xD;
grief and indignation when lie beheld the accommo-&#xD;
dations given to these poor people. Ten pounds stir-&#xD;
ling was the price of the tickets, yet if the vessel had&#xD;
been an African slaver her passengers could not have&#xD;
fared worse. The sight of its horrors was enough for&#xD;
a lifetime. Six hundred emigrants stowed into a&#xD;
place where fifty could not live cori~fortably-all&#xD;
without beds, blankets, or any other necessary thing.&#xD;
What a government, to provide so luxuriously for&#xD;
her children! Ten deaths had occurred among his&#xD;
people, and forty-one more were not able to land.&#xD;
Then there came the speculators who meet these&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN Two wORLDS.          83&#xD;
ships as they come in, offering to buy such goods as&#xD;
tire emigrants have to sell. How the poor Irishman&#xD;
gets cheated selling linen for a certain number of shil-&#xD;
lings, and finding an English shilling and an American&#xD;
shilling are two different coins!&#xD;
Then there is the scene on first landing, when the&#xD;
'poor ocean-tossed emni~rant cannot tell whether the&#xD;
b&#xD;
earth is under his feet or not, for it pitches and heaves&#xD;
with him just the same as the ocean did. "holy&#xD;
mother !" is his despairing cry, "would I were safe in&#xD;
green Ireland again."&#xD;
They huddle together, and try to give each that&#xD;
comfort lie is in want of himself; but everything is&#xD;
new and strange; they are dizzy, and sick, and worn&#xD;
out, so they all sit down together, and take a good&#xD;
Irish cry over their common trouble.&#xD;
The cmi grants were landed at Montreal, at a place&#xD;
called the Irishman's Inn. It is one of the curiosities&#xD;
of Lower Canada, covering a large tract of land-&#xD;
nearly thirty acres-and consisting of ranges of sheds&#xD;
without doors or windows. A board off the side&#xD;
serves to let in light, and an open space is left for the&#xD;
door. When families arrive, a~ much space is&#xD;
measured off as they require, and a mark is made so&#xD;
as to distinguish their claim. There are no con-&#xD;
veniences for cooking, and their culinary operations&#xD;
are carried on out of doors. Much borrowing and&#xD;
lending goes on, to eke out the neighbors' housekeep-&#xD;
ing. Though the Irish may light, they also love to&#xD;
oblige each other. The beds for these tenants of tire&#xD;
Irishman's Inn are trunks and boxes. Frequently&#xD;
some of them are ill from the effects of this miserable&#xD;

But the Irishman's curse is liquor-drinking, and it&#xD;
is carried on extensively at this famous resort, where&#xD;
goes to meet a friend or get a word from home.&#xD;
Relatives or not, the Irish are all brothers, and the&#xD;
popular mode of expressing regard is by offering "a&#xD;
treat ;" therefore it is no uncommon thing for ten&#xD;
barrels of whisky to ho consumed at the Inn in&#xD;
twenty-four hours. The only time when quiet reigns&#xD;
at this celebrated resort is from four to eight in the&#xD;

who are anxious enough that they should sleep mitil&#xD;

not be beaten.&#xD;
But it is useless to recapitulate all the terrible or&#xD;
disgusting exhibitions which may trace their causes&#xD;
back to the guilty negligence or cruel despotism of&#xD;
the English government. Suffice it to say, they were&#xD;
frequent and numerous enough to make Lord Cun-&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
A NUMBER of years passed, and Lord Cunningham&#xD;
continued to reside abroad; carrying on business&#xD;
both for himself and the government by means of&#xD;
correspondence, leaving Lady Cunningham to un-&#xD;
disputed possession of the estate, and her own plea-&#xD;
sures - a course which pleased her ladyship ~vell&#xD;
enough in some respects.&#xD;
In the meantime, John Woods, who is now under-&#xD;
stood to be his lordship's adopted son, has come to be&#xD;
a young man of fine personal appearance and mental&#xD;
qualifications. his lordship even had it in contem-&#xD;
plation to purchase a title for him; but was deterred&#xD;
by his scruples about making one of nature's noble-&#xD;
men a parasite of the English aristocracy. After-&#xD;
ward, when Marion remembered the liberality of her&#xD;
father's sentiments on this sbbject, she was at a loss&#xD;
to account for his subsequent action in the same&#xD;
matter of rank; but presumed that the effect of&#xD;
hereditary belief and early education was stronger&#xD;
even than deliberate conviction.&#xD;
To return: Marion as well as John had improved&#xD;
kwith' years and careful training in their quiet Cana-&#xD;
dian home; until she had already begun to be looked&#xD;
upon as being of a marriageable age, by certain of&#xD;

(laughter. Lord Cunninghaiii appeared incredulous&#xD;
and Sir Robert pressed his opinion. It was evident&#xD;
he expected the news to displease his lordship, and&#xD;
make him anxious to dispose of his daughter to a&#xD;
nobler suitor. But Cunningham only treated the&#xD;
suggestion as being of no consequence, or without&#xD;
sufficient evidence to be at all alarming. Never-&#xD;
theless, it is not improbable that he was influenced by&#xD;
the representations of Sir Robert to talk of separating&#xD;
the children, as lie still persisted in calling them, for&#xD;
he began to be niuch more observing of their inter-&#xD;
course than ever before ; still refusing, however, to&#xD;
listen to any insinuations from Lucy Or Sir Robert,&#xD;
that the young people were "in love" with each&#xD;
other. "My daughter is not 01(1 enough to have a&#xD;
serious passion," lie would say; "until she is, I shall&#xD;
not interfere with her youthful fancies."&#xD;
"how, old must a young lady be, to be old enough&#xD;
to imagine herself hi love? and to imagine one's self&#xD;
in that state of feeling, is just as dangerous as being&#xD;
there," was Sir Robert's answer.&#xD;
"Describe the symptoms, Sir Robert," demanded&#xD;
Lord Cunningham.&#xD;
"The indications, I thought, were known to every&#xD;
one; but, if I must be more explicit," said Sir Ro-&#xD;
bert, turning rather redder than usual, " they are those&#xD;
which you see in myself."&#xD;
"What am I- to understand?" asked Lord Cun-&#xD;
ningham.&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.         87&#xD;
"That I love your daughter, and desire to marry&#xD;
her I,'&#xD;
"Impossible! Marion does not think of marriage&#xD;
yet; until she does so, I shall never introduce t1~~&#xD;
subject. I am in no haste to part with my only&#xD;
daughter. When I do, it ~vill be at her own sug-&#xD;
gestion, or upon an intimation from her that she&#xD;
desires to leave me for some one she loves better; an&#xD;
event which is not likely to happen with one so much&#xD;
older as yourself, Sir Robert."&#xD;
This answer, or the latter part of it, nettled Sir&#xD;
Robert a good deal.&#xD;
"You will prove, I fear, an un~vise father," said he,&#xD;
coldly. "Every one but yourself can see the result.&#xD;
I offered to save your daughter, whom I love, from a&#xD;
misalliance, which she is now likely to form at any&#xD;
moment. Allow me to say that, not only myself,&#xD;
but all your friends, think you are doing altogether&#xD;
a foolish thing in permitting Lady Marion to be as-&#xD;
sociated so intimately with any young man, not a&#xD;
relative, whom you do not intend her to marry.&#xD;
Also, that you are encouragilig false hopes in this&#xD;
young person's mind ; who, flattered by your patron-&#xD;

struggle, and in that struggle you will lose your&#xD;
daughter."&#xD;
"Ii trust my daughter understands her duty, sir;&#xD;

Although his lordship dismissed the subject in this&#xD;
summary manner, it evidently had not passed out of&#xD;

his mind; for, as a result of his reflections, John&#xD;
Woods was sent on a mission to Ireland.&#xD;
Sir Robert, now having the ground entirely to him-&#xD;
self, and having already gained a strong point, con-&#xD;
tinued to beset Lord Cunningham with arguments,&#xD;
and his daughter with attentions, which were ac-&#xD;
cepted by her in entire innocence, she attributing&#xD;
these favors to the friendship existing between Sir Ro-&#xD;
bert and her father. Matters could not long go on in&#xD;
this way, and a crisis in affairs was about to happen.&#xD;
The persevering lover addressed himself to Lord&#xD;
Cunningham for a final answer, and Lord Cunning-&#xD;
ham promised to see his daughter. Going to her&#xD;
while she was at her books one day, lie alarmed her&#xD;
by the pallor of his countenance, and the unusual&#xD;
reserve of his manner, which to her was always frank&#xD;
and open. "What is the matter, my father," she&#xD;
asked ; "have you heard bad news?" and the bound&#xD;
her heart gave made her conscious what kind of ill&#xD;
news she dreaded the most.&#xD;
"There is nothing to alarm you, my child," an-&#xD;
swered his lordship with only a half smile ; "the&#xD;
errand I came upon I trust will prove a pleasant one&#xD;
to you. I am the bearer of a proposal of marriage&#xD;
from Sir Robert Nelson to Lady Marion Cunning-&#xD;
ham ; what ha e you to say to it, my clear?"&#xD;
"I am so surprised I can say nothing'" answei'ed&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
"But I have come expressly to have you say&#xD;
either yes or no. Sir Robert thinks lie has made a&#xD;
favorable impression, and he is in every way what&#xD;
we call a good match. I have promised him my in-&#xD;
&#xD;
fluence, and now use it, by telling you that I expect&#xD;
you to accept his addresses."&#xD;
"Gracious heaven! I eanuot," cried Marion, turn-&#xD;
ing deadly pale.&#xD;
" Your reason, Marion ?"&#xD;
"Every reasons: diflerence of age, tastes, opinions,&#xD;
and all other reasons. Indeed, my father, I cannot&#xD;
receive Sir Robert's addresses."&#xD;
"And my wishes have no influence with-you ?'~&#xD;
"Yes, all, any one's could ; but this. is something&#xD;
where I cannot be influenced."&#xD;
"Very well, Marion; I shall report to Sir Robert.&#xD;
By the way, it is talked of that John will marry a&#xD;
daughter of Lord John Fowler. Lord John has&#xD;
written to me to ask if I intend to apportion him&#xD;
and asks me to complete the arrangements for John's&#xD;
marriage. I shall do nothing of the kind at present,&#xD;
however. If John wishes to marry Lord Fowler's&#xD;
daughter, who is only half-blood, any way, I see no&#xD;
great objection, but I am not going to put him into the&#xD;
market by apportioning him, until I see how he turns&#xD;
out in his new position.&#xD;
Marion was distressed by this interview. She could&#xD;
see that her father was leaning toward the aristocracy&#xD;
in making plans for her future marriage. And these&#xD;
rumors about John, certainly meant something inimi-&#xD;
cal to her happiness; though she had no fears that he&#xD;
was false or forgetful. She had witnessed intrigue&#xD;
all her life. She was aware of the regular market&#xD;
made of marriageable children; and, in spite of her&#xD;
father's liberal sentiments, she had a presentiment of&#xD;
danger. But the blow had not yet fallen.&#xD;

condition of his spiritual affairs.&#xD;
LORD ELlA 5 DREAM.&#xD;
lie thought the day of final judgment had come,&#xD;
and that the "gmeen isle of' Erin" was quite se})arate&#xD;
from all other portions of the globe, and its people to&#xD;
be judged by themselves. The Rachites and Ribbon&#xD;
men were first judged, and after them, all that had&#xD;
perished for want of food. In a large book, open be-&#xD;
fore the Judge, was a perfect record of accounts-of&#xD;
the labor performed, and the wages received l)y the&#xD;
poor. The book also recorded the miames of land-&#xD;
holders and the amount of their possessions. Was&#xD;
God going to form an aristocracy of riches in heaven?&#xD;
When the record had all been looked over before&#xD;
the multitude, Christ appeared with garments and&#xD;
crowns of righteousness for the poor, who had suffered&#xD;
martyrdom at the hands of the rich! promising them&#xD;
to be made priests an(l kings in the heavenly world&#xD;
while many of this world's priests and kings were&#xD;
sent away into black darkness, dmsrobcd and un-&#xD;
crowned. When his doom was pronounced, the sen-&#xD;
tence was, that he should remain forever upon his&#xD;
chosen island; while, on looking about him, lie per-&#xD;
ceived Loch Erne to have turned into a sea of fire, and&#xD;
his watch-dogs into fiery dragons, and his servants&#xD;
into so many serpents to hiss at him. Food was let&#xD;
down to him in a basket, that when it caine almost&#xD;
within his reach, emptied its contents into th~ lake&#xD;
before his famishing eyes. Maddened by despair, he&#xD;

sought to find his wife to comfort him, but, in her&#xD;
stead, found the vindictive Lady Cunningham, who&#xD;
would cling about him in spite of his disgust. The&#xD;
struggle to fi'ec himself from her society, fixially awoke&#xD;
his lordship in a repentant state of mind ; and lie&#xD;
made haste to remove his dogs, and the most cruel of&#xD;
his servants, as a peace-ofl~ring to eternal justice.&#xD;
lIe also forbade all the waste food being thrown into&#xD;
the lake as heretofore, and ordered it given to the&#xD;
poor; and was almost in danger of forsaking his evil&#xD;
pi'actices.&#xD;
The good Lady Elia made haste to take advantage&#xD;
of this new mood, to minister to the wants of the suf-&#xD;
fering wretches who thronged about the estate at this&#xD;
good news; and many a poor creature, rescued from&#xD;
death by starvation, thanked her gentle ladyship with&#xD;
tears and blessings.&#xD;
But, this reformation was only partial, for the old&#xD;
lord had become so hard a drinker, and liquor made&#xD;
him so furious, that it was unsafe to venture to ad-&#xD;
dress him on any charitable subject late in the day.&#xD;
his dream still worked upon his mind; and, when he&#xD;
was drunk, he swore terribly at the Irish for usurping&#xD;
so high a place in the honors of the next world.&#xD;
The result of Sir IRobert~s representations concern-i&#xD;
ing Marion, was a number of letters to Lord Can-&#xD;
ninghamn ; and, among others, one from Lad~~~unning-&#xD;
ham urging his speedy return to Ireland, on account of&#xD;
her health, which was suffering from the care of the&#xD;
estate in such troublesome times, as well as from the&#xD;
long estrangement from her husband and. child. If&#xD;
Lady Cunningham had said that her health had de.&#xD;

would have told a truth. But, such an appeal would&#xD;
not have been so sure of bringing back the absentees as&#xD;
one which was directed more to their affections and&#xD;
sympathies. 11cr obj ect was to get some control of&#xD;
her husband's opinions, it' preten(liflg to a growing&#xD;
respect and regard for his own could effect this&#xD;
result. By this and other means she hoped to get&#xD;
Marion in her power, and to prevent the threatened&#xD;
calamity of a low marriage in her family.&#xD;
Lord Cunningham had lately been wishing to get&#xD;
rid of his business in Canada, in order to return to&#xD;
Ireland, and these cunningly written letters from&#xD;
Lady Cunningham and her friends had their full&#xD;
amount of influence in persuading him to take this&#xD;
step. In a few weeks after receiving them, he re-&#xD;
shipped himself and dawrliter for home.&#xD;
In order to give the affectation an air of truth,&#xD;
Lady Cunningham had made great preparations for&#xD;
their reception, and the castle was full of gay corn-&#xD;
P~11Y to welcome back her lord, and the youthful Lady&#xD;
Marion, her only daughter. had this company been&#xD;
of a different sort, the effect would have been better;&#xD;
but, both his lordship and Marion were so well&#xD;
pleased at the demonstrations of affection shown to-&#xD;

Good old Dr. Wilkins was delighted to see his&#xD;

" Where is John?" asked tile doctor, getting Lord&#xD;

"I do not know," answered his lordship, rather&#xD;
coldly.&#xD;
What ! not know ?" ejaculated the doctor; "why,&#xD;

"On the contrary, I sent him home several months&#xD;
ago," ans~vered Lord Cmnliingham. lIe then went on to&#xD;
tell the doctor confidentially that lie was disappointed&#xD;
in John, whoxil he had always believed to be the eldest&#xD;
son of Mr. Woods, a worthy and estimable man; but&#xD;
that, of late, he had received intimation that lle was&#xD;
all illegitimate son of a certain noble; and that he&#xD;
had been sent for to return to Ireland, as his father&#xD;
designed acknowledging him, and procuring him a&#xD;
pension from the government. "The young man,"&#xD;
continues his lordship, " was not to blanle; but I&#xD;

"Let us hope," said the doctor, "that our young&#xD;

might displease John's future father-in-law."&#xD;
The doctor looked sympathizingly at Marion, who&#xD;
was quite pale and silent during this conversation.&#xD;
lie had heard the current report of her attachment&#xD;
to John, and hoped it might be true; and had some&#xD;
confidence in Lord Cunningham that he would allow&#xD;
the match, lie was therefore disappointedd and&#xD;
grieved at this termination to his speculations. "So&#xD;
you do not know where John is?" said the doctor,&#xD;
absently.&#xD;
"I conclude he is in Dublin," answered Lord Cun-&#xD;

"Not that I have heard of. If what you have&#xD;
been told is true, he ~vil1 not often come up here, I&#xD;
presume."&#xD;
"No, most probably not,'~ said his lordship, shortly.&#xD;
This conversation, to which Marion was a passive&#xD;
listener, was the first intimation she ~had received of&#xD;
the facts in relation to the change in her father's pre-&#xD;
vious feelings and sentiments. She was not surprised&#xD;
either, that lie should take the position he did in re-&#xD;
ference to John. She now comprehended that, in&#xD;
urging her to marry Sjr Robert, he had determined&#xD;
to provide against the possibility of her connection&#xD;
with any of this spurious nobility, against which,&#xD;
for good and honorable reasons, he entertained a bitter&#xD;
contempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLI)S.&#xD;
With a quicker instinct than her father, she divined&#xD;
that all was not as it had been represented to him.&#xD;
She remembered the enmity of these now seeming&#xD;
friends, who, with her mother, so suddenly recoil-&#xD;
cued to her, were loading her with present favors.&#xD;
It was true time worst of men, 01(1 Lord Elia, made&#xD;
professions of sincere repentance, and declared him-&#xD;

but the conviction still lingered in her heart that&#xD;
all was not right among these people whom she had&#xD;
once known so vicious and remorseless. Carefully&#xD;
concealing her sorrow, in order not to provoke their&#xD;
observation, she resolved to investigate John's case&#xD;
as far as possible; and to get her father's help if she&#xD;
could.&#xD;
But troubles thickened around Marion. Lord&#xD;
Cunningham's new flatterers were exerting every&#xD;
nerve to gain his confidence. The candid and noble&#xD;
nature of his own mind made this a comparatively&#xD;
easy achievement, and it was with genuine satisfaction&#xD;
he listened to admissions of his old opponents that&#xD;
lie had beeii right and they wrong. his favorite&#xD;
measures met with commemmdatioii and he had hopes&#xD;
of yet being able to effect some good for Ireland.&#xD;
Added to this, the attentions shown his dan ghter, and&#xD;
the respect paid her opinions, were a most engaging&#xD;
forum of blandishment, since it was a tacit approval&#xD;
of the conr~e taken in her education.&#xD;
These demonstrations were not without their re-&#xD;

peel's than lie had done, and more inclined to look&#xD;
:unongst theuii for a husband for Marioti.&#xD;
As was to be expected from her position and pm'os-&#xD;
pects, she soon llulnl)ered quite a list of admirers.&#xD;
To all advances of this nature Marion gave but mu-&#xD;
different encouragement. She had a difficult part to&#xD;
act, and fully comprehended her situation. She did&#xD;
not attempt to conceal from herself that John Woods&#xD;
was the choice of her heart; yet, she had resolved&#xD;
in the event of his proving to be illegitimate, not to&#xD;
compromise her lather with those who had ridiculed&#xD;
himmi for his liberal views with regard to his educa-&#xD;
tion ; and for cultivating in her an independent judg-&#xD;
inent of her own. She would not now reward him&#xD;
for this generosity with ingratitude; and, unless she&#xD;
could have his full consent, she would not marry,&#xD;
however much her heart was interested. But as she&#xD;
had not yet had an opportunity of explaining her&#xD;
sentiments and intentions to her father, and as he&#xD;
seemed entirely to have forgotten that such a person&#xD;
as John Woods existed, she daily dreaded the trial&#xD;
which she knew only too well was in store for her.&#xD;
Among the many honorable proposals for her hand,&#xD;
was one from the Duke of . As this was quite&#xD;
an unobjectionable offer, and highly gratifying to the&#xD;

Lady Marion that there was to be an end of trifling.&#xD;

She had refused several very distinguished offers&#xD;
because she did not "love" the applicants for her&#xD;

not allow to approach her? Let her accept the duke's&#xD;
proposal, and she would soon learn to love him.&#xD;
To all this reasoning Marion o1)poSed a steady&#xD;
firmness of purpose. She would not marry any&#xD;
of these men proposed. If her father required it, she&#xD;
would promise to remain unmarried. But that was&#xD;
not his lordship's wish; and, in the excitement of&#xD;
what he thought a stubborn contention for rights ~n&#xD;
her part, he even went so far as to threaten her with&#xD;
1ummishment of some sort for her disobedience. "Re-&#xD;
member Emma Cunningham !" was Marion's reply.&#xD;
"It was you, father, who taught me to respect my&#xD;
own judgment and feelings against all opposition.&#xD;
This hand and heart of mine, are the only things over&#xD;
which God has given me entire and unconditional&#xD;
control, thereby intimating that I ought to be very&#xD;

affection ever warned? Who ever realized that a&#xD;

approached his dissolution, he showed even more than&#xD;
ordinary affection and care for his daughter. his&#xD;
wistful eyes followed her wherever she moved, as if&#xD;
he saw through thnt troubled future into which his&#xD;
death would plunge her. Calling her to him on the&#xD;
last day, he kindly asked her for the confession she&#xD;
had promised to make him.&#xD;
"Father, it is John Woods I love," she answered&#xD;
bravely; "if you disapprove of him, I shall regard&#xD;
your wishes."&#xD;
"Not of him, but of his birth. Let him prove&#xD;
himself an honest man' s son"&#xD;
" Unless that is proven, your daughter honors her&#xD;

"To punish her ?" repeated his lordship. "Pi'av&#xD;
how do you punish young ladies, Lady Cunning-&#xD;

"As they deserve," answered her ladyship, sailing&#xD;
from the room.&#xD;
While the old man was uneasily pacing the room,&#xD;
waiting for news of Marion, she appeared, her face&#xD;
and eyes swollen red with weeping. Her counte-&#xD;
nance brightened up on seeing her grandfather, who&#xD;
opened hi~ ai'ms to 1~eeei~'e her.&#xD;
"What have you been doing, my dear, to deserve&#xD;

had ?"&#xD;
"A whipping, grandfather; and because IL refuse&#xD;
to dress myself in a more attractive manner, and&#xD;
wear jewels while I am in mourning for my father."&#xD;
The mention of her father brought on a fresh par-&#xD;
oxysm of weeping. The old Scotchman's blood was&#xD;
roused, particularly as he could see on Marion's&#xD;
shoulders the red marks of the whip. After mixing&#xD;
up, for a few moments, oaths at Lady Cunningham&#xD;

with the common blood at a greater cost," lie&#xD;
added, turnimig l)ale, "than ever it should bring&#xD;

Lady Cunninglmrn, who dreaded the influence of&#xD;
her grandfather's interference upon Marion, and&#xD;
unwilling that she should overhear more of this con-&#xD;
versation, at this juncture ordered her from the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"Not yet," said Lord Cummiugham, stopping her&#xD;
retreat, "I have a word to say to you. If you can-&#xD;
not, by rendering all reasonable obedience, keep upon&#xD;
goo(l terms with your mother, I give you permission&#xD;
to come to me, and I will protect you from injury.&#xD;
Nevertheless, I counsel you to try to live with your&#xD;
mother, as being most pm'oper and natural. And you,&#xD;
Lady Cunningham, I counsel not to use too strong&#xD;
measures with this child, because it will be l)roductive&#xD;
only of trouble, to you as well as hem'."&#xD;
"I will manage my own domestic matters in my&#xD;
own way," was the answer of her ladyship, as she&#xD;
repeated her command for ~farion to quit the m.oom.&#xD;
Nothing that had been said or done had any effect&#xD;
to change Lady Cunningham's purposes with regard&#xD;
to her daughter; but, Marion, after considering the&#xD;
chances, determined to endure this sort of life for the&#xD;
time remaining until she should come of age. She&#xD;
I)ehieved she could hold out against any amount of&#xD;
persecution applied to herself'. The servants, how-&#xD;
evem', thought differently. Old Lucy was in constant&#xD;
distm'ess about her foster-child's unhappy condition&#xD;

and, stickler for propriety as she was, almost wished&#xD;
Marion could hear of John Woods, in order to seek&#xD;
his protection. Others of the 01(1 servants, when they&#xD;
heard the blows tall oii Marion's back, held tlieinselveui&#xD;
ready to fly to the rescue at the first outcry; but&#xD;
Marion sul)lnitted to the pain of the punishuwut&#xD;
rather than call in the aid of these humble friends,&#xD;
ose sympathy would only lose them their 1)laces.&#xD;
wh&#xD;
One consideration which induced Marion's patient&#xD;
submission, was the hope that, by remaining where&#xD;
she was, she should in time hear something of John,&#xD;
and be enabled to establish an understanding with&#xD;
him; so that in case of being compelled to leave&#xD;
home, she should have his slI~)port to depend on.&#xD;
She was more likely, too, to hear of hiii, in such a&#xD;
way as to satisfy her own munid upon time point of his&#xD;
legitimacy, by remaining near Lady (Junmmiglmam,&#xD;
who, she was persuaded, knew inure about him than&#xD;
most peOl)lC. Nor was she mistaken in this calcula-&#xD;
tion. The Duke of - still remained a good friend&#xD;
to her; and Lady Cunningham, though informed of' his&#xD;
intention to withdraw his suit, with or without his&#xD;
father's consent, still hoped that he woUl(l change his&#xD;
mind.&#xD;
Lord Chailes Elia, who had lately made some pre-&#xD;
tensions toward Marion's hand, was displeased with&#xD;
her ladyship's preference for the (luke, and treadle-&#xD;
rously exposed a plot, to which lie was ~)arty, bet~veen&#xD;
Lady Cunningham and Lord B , an intiniate&#xD;

the government, had for some time deceived not only&#xD;
Lord Cunningham, but John himself. There was no&#xD;
longer anything to be gained in that direction ; and,&#xD;
to 1)lmt an end forever to all doubt, or possibility of&#xD;
Marion's adhering to him in his position as a farmer's&#xD;
son, lie was accused of theft.&#xD;
When Marion learned these facts from her friend&#xD;
the duke, who was informed by Lord Charles Elia,&#xD;
she felt her former suspicious confirmed. Indeed,&#xD;
there was no longer any occasion to doubt the whole&#xD;
conspiracy. Great as was the danger, Marion could&#xD;
not help feeling rejoiced that she was at liberty,&#xD;
according to her promise, to entertain her former&#xD;
sentiments for her lover, and to give him what aid&#xD;
or consolation she could. So closely was she still&#xD;
watched that it was difficult to hold any correspond-&#xD;
ence with him. The case of Grace Ford was held up&#xD;
as a warning, not only by Lady Cunningham, but&#xD;
many other parents-and afforded a good excuse for&#xD;
unusual watchfulness. here was a girl whose parents&#xD;
were of the highest respectability, who had eloped&#xD;
with a common man. Up to the time her father&#xD;
brought a husband of his own selection, and urged&#xD;
his acceptance, against the strongest repulsion on hem'&#xD;
part, she had been a quiet, obedient girl; but the&#xD;
prospect of being forced into this loathsome marriage,&#xD;
had roused the resistance of her nature. She flatly&#xD;
refused to Imave anything to say to this nman selected&#xD;
for her, and was put in confinement for her obstinacy.&#xD;
The death of an uncle, calling her father away from&#xD;
home, allowed her an opportunity of escape. She&#xD;
procured the keys of the outer doors, and eluding&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.      109&#xD;
those servants she could not persuade to be out of the&#xD;
way, made her escape, and locked the doors behind&#xD;
her, throwing the keys where they might afterward&#xD;
be found. She had persuaded a man to accompany&#xD;
her, whose protection she preferred to her father's.&#xD;
This bold act furnished an excuse for great vigilance&#xD;
among parents of marriageable daughters, and gave&#xD;
an air of lofty duty to the most absolute domestic&#xD;
despotism.&#xD;
Agitated by fears of Marion's reiinacting Grace&#xD;
Ford, Lady Cunniughani had put her in confinement.&#xD;
This fact being known to Charles Elia, he had threat-&#xD;
ened to effect Marion's release, as well as that of&#xD;
Woods, in order that what Lady Cunningham so&#xD;
dreaded might be brought about, as a special revenge&#xD;
upon her for her late slights to himself.&#xD;
A message came to Marion one morning from thc&#xD;
duke, and the page who brought it refusing to&#xD;
deliver it, except to Lady Marion in person, a reluc-&#xD;
tant admittance was granted him to her apartment.&#xD;
The boy observed that Lady Cunningham, who&#xD;
accompanied him, turned a key before entering, and&#xD;
that although the note was given to Marion, there&#xD;
was no chance of getting her reply, as it was evident&#xD;
Lady Cunningham intended to prevent any corres-&#xD;
pondence which did not l)~85 through her hands.&#xD;
There was no way then but for the p~1ge to return&#xD;
without an answer, and repoi't 1)I'oceedings to his&#xD;
master.&#xD;
No sooner was the boy gone than Lady Cuii-&#xD;
ningham demanded the note from Marion, who&#xD;
refused to give it up. A scene then ensued which is&#xD;

shocking to relate. Lady Cunningham entei'ed into&#xD;
a struggle with her dan ghter to obtain possession of'&#xD;
the duke's message, which ended by Marion's I)llt-&#xD;
ting the paper into 11cr month and chewing it ; where-&#xD;
upon Lady Cunningham l)1'essed her fin gel's upon hiei'&#xD;
daughter's throat to force her to yield by choking her,&#xD;
until the paper dropped and Marion's head PAl on&#xD;
one side. Her ladyship was somewhat frightened&#xD;
for a moment, but seeing her revive, she proceeded to&#xD;
examine the paper; which, owing to the treatment it&#xD;
had received was by this time quite illegible-only&#xD;
enough remained to assum'e Marion that it was the&#xD;
hand-writing of John XVoods.&#xD;
Marion perceived that whatever were its contents,&#xD;
they could Iii 110 way benefit her at present, and was&#xD;
well-nigh overcome by despair. her mother's con-&#xD;
duct on this occasion was so violent, that she began&#xD;
to fear worse things than mere imprisonment. how-&#xD;
ever, there was no way for her but to persevere in&#xD;
adhering to the cause she had espoused, though the&#xD;
principle of' tame submission was somewhat changed&#xD;
by the present appearance of her case.&#xD;
She waited for the next step in the drama. Lady&#xD;
Cunningham brought writing materials and coin-&#xD;
manded her to write as she dictated. This Marion&#xD;
said she would not do unless what she required her&#xD;
to write was tile truth, or if compelled, she should&#xD;
preface the writing by an explanation. Affairs had&#xD;
come to such a pass with her that she could no lon-&#xD;
ger consider it her duty to God ~r society to quietly&#xD;
submit to all this cruelty. She had suffered whip.&#xD;
pings and imprisonment at first rather than risk the&#xD;

possibility of' doing wrong by resisting; now, how-&#xD;
ever, her mind was made up to a dificrent cause.&#xD;
Lady Cunningham stamped with rage at this deti-&#xD;
anCe, and drew her ever-ready whip ; but Marion&#xD;
arrested her hand holding her mother firmly at the&#xD;
same time. 11cr ladyship was siu'prised at this&#xD;
unexpected movement. " 1 shall not hurt you," said&#xD;
Marion, "but neither shall I allo~v you to strike me.&#xD;

Her first impulse upon finding herself at liberty&#xD;
was to fly at once beyond the reach of her mother.&#xD;
A little reflection, however, convinced her that she&#xD;
might commit a great imprudence by doing so. That&#xD;
something must soon be done to mend her conditions&#xD;
she had nO (loubt, but that something must be well-&#xD;
chosen and efficient. Should she take refuge with&#xD;
her grandfather? Lady Cunningham could easily&#xD;
l)rin~ her away from there ; and beside, the Scotch&#xD;
sentiment was all against disobedience. Small then&#xD;

all classes that had any claim to respectability-such&#xD;
was the public sentiment. To the servants it was&#xD;
unsafe to confide anything. No matter how much&#xD;
they might be devoted to her, they were such blun-&#xD;
dering creatures destruction attended upon their ser-&#xD;
vices. Dependent, too, upon their masters, it would&#xD;
be unfair to put their interests in jeopardy by imnpli-&#xD;

a CODY of the trial, the better to ju(lgO of the&#xD;
strength of the testimony against him. The swear-&#xD;
ing on both sides was very convincing, but the pro-&#xD;
secution was a little the strongest. Though the case&#xD;
was evidently one of great mystery, inasmuch as the&#xD;
character and circumstances of the accused placed&#xD;
him above suspicion, yet' there was uo room left for&#xD;
doubt in the evidence, which was 1)OSitive and clear.&#xD;
Marion found little in the details of the case to give&#xD;
her comfort. She learned that even his own father,&#xD;
resenting the disgrace brought on his ~'ood name,&#xD;
refused to pity or forgive him, and convinced by the&#xD;
evidence, did not allow himself to doubt his son's&#xD;
guilt. Not so his mother, who like Marion refused&#xD;
to believe it, tlm~ughm she had not Marion's good rea-&#xD;
sons for doing so. Nor would Marmn communicate&#xD;
to her these reasons, fearing that time just indignation&#xD;

with John, and comfort him, she felt bound to (10 so.&#xD;
The opportunity, however much desired, did not&#xD;
oc~iii' lbr sending consolation to the unhappy prisoner.&#xD;
For seven long months Marion had quietly endured&#xD;
insult and derision, as well as occasional persecution.&#xD;
At the end of this time the Archbishop of&#xD;
caine on a visit to Lady Cunningham. To him, as&#xD;
her spiritual adviser, Lady Cunningham communi-&#xD;
cated her trouble on account of her daughter, and&#xD;
asked his advice. The bishop, being a widower,&#xD;
entered into this family history with unusual in-&#xD;
tercst; and Lady Cunningham found from his counsel&#xD;
that Mariomi could be disinherited. This was having&#xD;
her in her power in a satisfactory sense; but she was&#xD;
prll(lent enough to use caution in the case. The quiet&#xD;
and determined manner that her daughter still pre-&#xD;
served, notwithstanding the humiliating circumstances&#xD;
of her position, informed her ladyship and others that&#xD;
she was not yet so completely humbled as they could&#xD;
d~sire. Those whom she had ventured to dislike&#xD;
before, she still treated with undisguised contempt;&#xD;
all their ability to annoy her seemed exhausted. This&#xD;
was sufficient cause for her ladyship's displeasure,&#xD;
had there been no better; the malicious never forgive&#xD;
those whom they cannot wound.&#xD;
Lady Cunningham asked the bishop if lie thought&#xD;
it possible she still had a hope of being restored to&#xD;
Woods at the end of his term of imprisonment, which&#xD;
was seven years; and the good bishop believed there&#xD;
would be no trouble in finding out the state of her&#xD;
mind by using a little strategy, which would be per-&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFF~ IN TWO WOl~LDS.      117&#xD;
feetly justifiable. She might write out a contract,&#xD;
pledging her never to speak to, or in any way recog-&#xD;
nize John Woods; mailing such an act a forfeiture of&#xD;
her claim to all her father's estate. It was true the&#xD;
law made no provision for such cases, and the for-&#xD;
feiture might ifot stand a trial; but then, if she did&#xD;
not know that, the test would be just as severe.&#xD;
Again, a large share of what would ultimately be&#xD;
hers, was still in the hands of her grandfather; and&#xD;
the old gentleman, since Lady Emma's death, had&#xD;
been a little weak on the point of marriages of choice,&#xD;
so there was no certainty of his codperatioii: hut&#xD;
the bishop was on good terms with the old lord and&#xD;
might use his influence in favor of the good order of&#xD;
society depending upon this natter. At all events it&#xD;
would (10 no harm to try this plan. It was her duty&#xD;
to show that she had authority over her child, and to&#xD;
obtain that authority at any price; and, since her&#xD;
daughter had openly refused obedience in certain&#xD;
cases, it was her privilege to compel her. She there-&#xD;
fore thought it best such a writing as he had men-&#xD;
tioned should be drawn, and Lady Marion required&#xD;
to consent to the conditions proposed.&#xD;
11cr ladyship was very grateful for this advice,&#xD;
comforting as it did with her own notions of pro-&#xD;
priety, and became so penetrated with respect for&#xD;
the wisdom of the bishop, that she caine to the conchi-&#xD;
sion he would be a much more efficient father to Ma-&#xD;
rion than Lord Cunningham ever had been. Arrange-&#xD;
ments were accordingly entered into for the transfer&#xD;
of titles and authoritY into the hands of his lordship,&#xD;
and Lady Cunniughairm became Lady Fredonia.&#xD;

Not long after this event the bishop inquired of&#xD;
Marion if she had been confirmed, and finding that&#xD;
she had imot, insisted on having the matter attended&#xD;
to immediately. As most of Marion's bitterest one-&#xD;
mies and slanderers were members of this church,&#xD;
she declined having her name connected with them&#xD;
at present. She believed she could serve God ac-&#xD;
ceptably without becoming a member of any church;&#xD;
and, for the present, preferred that way to any&#xD;
other. The bishop insisted and she declined. The&#xD;
bishop said she must, and themi she said she would&#xD;
not; that hem' judgment was clearly against it, Ub well&#xD;
as her feelings. This provoked the good man ex-&#xD;
ceedingly, and some l)lain talk took place on both&#xD;
sides. At this juncture Lady Fredonia interfered,&#xD;
amid informed her daughter that unless she obeyed,&#xD;
not only in this case but many others where she had&#xD;
heretofore been refractory, she should leave the&#xD;
castle, never to return. She then gave Marion a&#xD;
paper, conunanding her to read and comply, or quit&#xD;
her sight for ever.&#xD;
Poor Marion! no wonder her hand shook, that held&#xD;
the copy of such cruel conditions, knowing there was&#xD;
no alternative but compliance or disinheritance and&#xD;
expulsion from her father's house. She did not&#xD;
hesitate long. "Have I read aright," she asked her&#xD;
mother, "awl ani I to be driven forth from my home&#xD;
and my inheritance ?"&#xD;
"You are the person to decide that," answered&#xD;
Lady Fredonia.&#xD;
"I have decided, then," she replied, with a fox cod&#xD;

which, and a purse of gold she had long, laid by for&#xD;

strangers. None knew of her intention; the ser-&#xD;
vants could only say they observed their young lady&#xD;
walking away quite rapidly that afternoon ; but sup-&#xD;
posed she was going to visit some of the tenants.&#xD;
it had not been Lady Cunningham's purpose really&#xD;
t6 banish Marion at once; nor did she apprehend so&#xD;
resolute a movement on her daughter's part. She&#xD;
thought to intimidate her by this extreme course;&#xD;
or, if she still resisted, to select her place of banish-&#xD;
went herself. Even when night came, and. Marion&#xD;
had not returned, she refrained from taking any steps&#xD;
to find her, hoping she was lingering somewhere in&#xD;
the neighborhood, and wishing not to appear anxious&#xD;
about her. The bishop was sure the spirit of God&#xD;
had no residence in so obstinate a heart; and hoped&#xD;
this latter measure might have some effect in bringing&#xD;
her to a sense of her obligations to her friends. She&#xD;
hoped she might yet be led to ask pardon for her sins,&#xD;
of God and her mother.&#xD;
When four days had elapsed and no word from&#xD;
Marion came, Lady Fredonia thought it time to&#xD;
make some examination of her daughter's effects, and&#xD;
discover, if she could, what provisions she had made&#xD;
for a journey. Not much, however, had been taken&#xD;
away, and it could not be possible that she had gone&#xD;
far. "Was it possible she had gone to Scotland, to&#xD;

given her to sign?" That was a conjecture which&#xD;
gave her little or no comfort; ai~din the hope of&#xD;

finding out the direction taken by her daughter, she&#xD;
dispatched servants in all directions with in(juiries&#xD;
for the missing young lady.&#xD;
All that was learned was that the stage-drivei's&#xD;
l)ad noticed a young woman walking on the road,&#xD;
who seemed to ans\vei' the descriptio11 given; and&#xD;
that she was evidently quite lame from walking. her&#xD;

gone, as servant, on l)oard the ship Albion, Captain&#xD;
Robinson, bound to America.&#xD;
This information, llnl)leasant as it was in some&#xD;
respects, relieved Lady Fredonia's mind of its chief&#xD;
trouble. Marion had not gone to her grandfather's,&#xD;
and she ha~i not to apprehend any difficulty in that&#xD;
direction. It would have been a great trial, after&#xD;
having attained an influential position as Lady Fre-&#xD;
donia, in the church as well as in society-to have&#xD;
had these domestic discords transpire, and have old&#xD;
Lord Cunningham reproaching her with severity or&#xD;
injustice to his grandchild.&#xD;
But the course which Marion had taken, in going&#xD;
to America without her grandfather's advice, was&#xD;
sure to meet with censure from him, as well as every-&#xD;
body else; it would, therefore,~ be no longer doubted&#xD;
she was a most ungrateful child. As for Marion, she&#xD;
had placed herself in the school to punish herself&#xD;
severely, and she hoped she would not be spared&#xD;
until she was hmnble enough to return penitent.&#xD;
Lady iFredonia was settling herself (lown to feel&#xD;
resigned to this rather fortunate occurrence, which&#xD;
&#xD;
On~ LIFE IN iwo WORLDS.       121&#xD;
deprived her of a disobedient daughter, without dis-&#xD;
turbing her possession of that daughters estate,&#xD;
when a letter caine from old Lord Cunnin 'un, ask-&#xD;
ing for an explanation of a letter he had received&#xD;
rrom Captain Robinson, of the ship Albion, which&#xD;
enclosed one from Marion, together with a copy of a&#xD;
certain requisition made by Lady Fredonia under for-&#xD;
feiture of her right by inheritance. This unexpected&#xD;
inquiry for a short time puzzled Lady Fredonia to&#xD;
answer. But, coming to the conclusion, at the insti-&#xD;
gation of her lord, to put a bold face upon the mat-&#xD;
ter, she replied to Lord Cuniugham that she had a&#xD;
right to dispose of her child as she pleased, and was&#xD;
under no obligation to account to his lordship for&#xD;
anything she might choose to do. This answer dis-&#xD;
turbed the composure of the old Scotchman not a&#xD;
little: not only on account of Marion, but as a mat-&#xD;
ter of rights. He inquired of himself what Lady&#xD;
Fredonia expected to do, if she thought to retain&#xD;
Marion's inheritance while she lived. The result of&#xD;
his reflections was the resolve to contest the point&#xD;
of her authority to do what she had done by her&#xD;
daughter.&#xD;
Poor, foolish man! lie has forgotten what were&#xD;
once his o~vn sentiments upon the rights of parents;&#xD;
that England, Scotland and Ireland hold to these&#xD;
sentiments still. Lady Fredonia is supported on all&#xD;
sides by the opinion of the church and society, and&#xD;
by the counsel of a bishop whose influence even m&#xD;
the House of Commons is unlimited. Were Lady&#xD;
Fredonia even not a bishop's wife, but alone in the&#xD;
world, as she was a few months before, the whole&#xD;

sentunent of the aristocracy would be in 11cr fhvor;&#xD;
therefore the contest must be purely a legal one.&#xD;
Much feeling was expressed on this subject in the&#xD;
'louse of Lords, wlieii it was known that. Bishop Fre-&#xD;
donia wanted her ladyship's right to do what she&#xD;
had done, tested. Lord Charles Cunningham Ila(1&#xD;
been an upright man, and had many warni friends&#xD;
among his peers, whose sentiments were somewhat&#xD;
like his own, and who were ready to doubt tli~&#xD;
authority of Lady Fredonia to turn off her daughter,&#xD;
or to claim that her daughter had forfeited her estate.&#xD;
A great deal of discussion grew out Qf the question.&#xD;
Bishop Fredonia said he only asked an expression of&#xD;
feeling on the subject. Did the sentiment of tile&#xD;
people sustain Lady Fredonia, or did it not? Some&#xD;
of the dead Lord Cunningham's frieifds felt that it&#xD;
was not treating his memory rightly to agitate the&#xD;
question: Let it not even be mentioned that his&#xD;
dangilter had forsaken her home. Tile young lady&#xD;
had voluntarily resigned her birthright, and probably&#xD;
would never claim it: and it was most unmanly&#xD;
business, Ilunting down a yOullg lady or her property&#xD;
in that way.&#xD;
LORD ELlA'S REMARKs.&#xD;
Lord Elia was of opinion that, to give the young&#xD;
lady her property, would be to establish a dangerous&#xD;
precedent. Tile moment the sons and daughters of&#xD;
the aristocracy were allowed to take such indepen-&#xD;
(lent ideas, the very foundation of an aristocracy was&#xD;
razed. It was by protecting the sentiment against&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWo WORLDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
intermarriage with the people, and inheritance of&#xD;
Property, that they kept the institution in existence.&#xD;
Tue only questions to be asked in making engage-&#xD;
inents for their children, were-are the parties&#xD;
1)roperly coilnected, and thoroughly aristocratic in&#xD;
feeling. There was great reason, too, why they&#xD;
should be sound on the church question, as ~veil as&#xD;
on questions of politics : the church was the nation,&#xD;
and the nation was the church. There must be a&#xD;
oneness of sentiment. Parliament must sustain the&#xD;
action of the church, and the church must sanctify&#xD;
the doings of Parliament. Lord Cunningham, when&#xD;
living, had thought it was wrong to allow great men&#xD;
to present their i1legitiIn~lte children to parliament&#xD;
to pension. It would be remembered that when&#xD;
Bishop Fredonia's sons were provided for,. Lord Cun-&#xD;
ningham lla(l declared it was an outrage for a bishop&#xD;
to Ilave such sons; much more to ask the people to&#xD;
provide for them.&#xD;
Lord Ehia laughed as he spoke of the happiness&#xD;
WiliCh lords or commoners would have if they&#xD;
allowed church patrons to preach morality or rebuke&#xD;
their pleasant little sins! Lord Elia thought Charles&#xD;
Cunningham's sentiments on liquor drinking were&#xD;
equally remarkable. lie had heard him say the&#xD;
queen's liquor bill was a disgrace to the nation: and&#xD;
that a good woman, though a queen, ought not to&#xD;
uphold the practices of drinking and gambling by&#xD;
the example of any such enormous expenditures as&#xD;
were made for such indulgences. But what could&#xD;
tile queen do, or the ministers? It would not answer&#xD;
to restrict people of these liberties, said Lord Elia.&#xD;

&#xD;
Besides ! said lie, the illegitimate children coin-&#xD;
plained of, are a good stock to keep on hand for the&#xD;
army. It takes men brought up under degrading&#xD;
influences to manage British troops, men who are&#xD;
willing to give theiti every liberty, and who by pro-&#xD;
mising them license encourage them to fight for con-&#xD;
quest. British soldiers always expect to abuse&#xD;
women, and commit any other outrage they see fit&#xD;
to do. It is the English policy, and more conquer-&#xD;
ing than hard fighting. You may overpower a peo-&#xD;
ple, but, until you have degraded them they are not&#xD;
subdued. The influence of the soldiery in that&#xD;
respect had done more to keep the British Islands in&#xD;
subjection than all the powder and ball ever used.&#xD;
His lordship quite brought down the house when he&#xD;
spoke of the late Lord Cunningham's sentiments con-&#xD;
cerning the house of Grafton, which received a pen-'&#xD;
sion of forty or, fifty thousand pounds sterling for&#xD;
being sprung froni a natural son of Charles IL&#xD;
though he feigned a delicacy in speaking of certain&#xD;
ladies who, he said, had been lightly spoken of by&#xD;
the late Lord Cunningham for the same reason-&#xD;
being pensioners to the amount of eighty thousand&#xD;
pounds-sisters of the Duke of S . Lord Elia&#xD;
afl~cted to think this expenditure proper and honor-&#xD;
able under the circumstances, and an example to&#xD;
other nations of generosity toward the sex. lie was&#xD;
proud that it could he done. It was a different style&#xD;
of conduct in these matters to that pursued by their&#xD;
republican cousins, members of the Congress of the&#xD;
United States, who went dodging round dark streets,&#xD;
with their hats pulled over their eyes in a peculiarly&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
hang-dog manner. He had heard that Cunningham&#xD;
particularly admired this republican fashion, because&#xD;
every man had to pay out of his own pocket for his&#xD;
1)leasures, for his part there was nothing manly&#xD;
about it in his eyes. Supposing these members of&#xD;
Congress had children ~ Who was to support them?&#xD;
or were they to go unsupported?&#xD;
At length, some gentlemen who were with Elia in&#xD;
sentiment, became aware of the impropriety of advo-&#xD;
cating such sentiments in such a place, and persuaded&#xD;
him to drop the subject. The nation professed to be&#xD;
not only Christian, but eminent in morals, and Ins&#xD;
lordship was taking rather broad grounds, publicly.&#xD;
Bishop Fredonia, too, said the question (lid not pro-&#xD;
perly come within the bounds of legislation. How-&#xD;
ever, he desired an expression of opinion with regard&#xD;
to the course pursued by himself and Lady Fredo-&#xD;
ida with regard to her ladyship's daughter. lie&#xD;
wished to be sustained by public sentiment in doing&#xD;
what he believed to be his duty in so difficult a ques-&#xD;
tion as one of justice to his late lordship's daughter,&#xD;
who, it would be seen by the sentiments entertained&#xD;
by her father, whose pupil she had been, was inclined&#xD;
to disloyal opinions, and certainly showed great con-&#xD;
tempt both for church and State, as well as filial&#xD;
duty. The Bishop's zeal in setting forth the purity of&#xD;
his motions, and advocating the claims of the church&#xD;
and the government on all true subjects, was at length&#xD;
rewarded by receiving the indorsernent of his party&#xD;
and friends, and applauded by cheers and "long live&#xD;
such leaders of the church of England."&#xD;

Although Lady FredQua found her course ai~~&#xD;
proved of by a majority, she was f~r from being&#xD;
happy in the result. 11cr liusl)and, supported by his&#xD;
social position, could practise with nnpunity such&#xD;
vices as her former husband had always avoi(led;&#xD;
and much of her wealth went toward his pleasures in&#xD;
wine, ~)lay and Other luxuries aIl(l amusements not&#xD;
strictly Christlike in their natures. It did not add to&#xD;
her contentment to find that lie kept a jewel-box&#xD;

gain, as that would be gambling, but only as memen-&#xD;

Lady Fredonia was not long in discovering that&#xD;
her new lord was deeply in debt, and that he had&#xD;
managed to put his own property into such a shape&#xD;
that it could not be reached, and was paying off old&#xD;
obligations out of hers. Not ojily this, but his child-&#xD;
ren's expenses came out of it in the same way, and&#xD;
they were very extravagant. His liquor bill, too,&#xD;
exceeded already all that she had ever known Lord&#xD;
Cunningham to expend inthat way during his life~&#xD;
time. It soon became apparent to her for what&#xD;
reason the bishop had so readily seconded her views&#xD;
with regard to Marion; and conscience whispered&#xD;
that for this reckless expenditure, disrespectful treat-&#xD;

to fear she was getting her reward for all this evil-&#xD;
doing.&#xD;
IRecklessly had she sacrificed the happiness of several&#xD;
innocent persons in order to procure her own will and&#xD;
pleasure; and now she seemed about to be sacrified&#xD;
with the same unscrupulollsfle$5 to the vice and&#xD;
pleasure of others equally unpi.incil)led. She often&#xD;
repented that Marion had been so hicartlussly cast off~&#xD;
iV it were only to have her to opl)Ose to the bishop's&#xD;
daughters, who had taken little 1)ains to niake them-&#xD;

wandered homeless and penniless on the face of the&#xD;
earth, while these upstarts 5t00(l in her place, sonic-&#xD;
times almost maddened her. But the bishop was not&#xD;
a man to be moved either by entreaty or threats.&#xD;
lie knew his power too well, and her ladyship soon&#xD;
learned to feel the power that compelled her acqui-&#xD;
escence. It was in vain she resolved and re-resolved&#xD;
to defy his power to set aside her own child to make&#xD;
room for his daughters, and (leternuined to give up to&#xD;
him nO further. She felt that she had been duped,&#xD;
and made the tool of designing persoils.&#xD;
There was, however, no chance to undo the past.&#xD;
While she was reflecting on her situation, past and&#xD;
future, a process was served on her, securing the l)ro-&#xD;

longer any motive to induce her to keep the pro-&#xD;

seemed to dislike her as much as she did them, and&#xD;
she had no desire to bestow any favors on them.&#xD;
Therefore, s lie was rather glad of this turn in her&#xD;
affairs.&#xD;
Confusion reigned on the estate, and every day&#xD;
brought fears of open rebellion. Many of the tenants&#xD;
refused to pay rents, and none could be compelled to&#xD;
pay tithes. Pounding, cutting and fighting were the&#xD;
daily amusements of lord and tenants. Five proctors&#xD;
had been killed and others wounded. God only&#xD;
could foresee the end of these difficulties.&#xD;
r1~Iie separation of Woods from his wife was another&#xD;
occasion of ill-feeling. The people, who always wel-&#xD;
come outside influence, persist in suspecting Lady&#xD;
Fredonia of having been instrumental in causing the&#xD;
separation. Ehia's family may have said it; or a&#xD;
servant may have got hold of this suspicion from&#xD;
overhearing tImings said at the castle. Lady Fre-&#xD;
donia's life was threatened, since the conspiracy was&#xD;
suspected. Indeed, there remained no doubt in the&#xD;
minds of many who remembered all the circum-&#xD;
stances of John's accusation and Lady Marion's dis-&#xD;
appearance, that both were victims of a studied per-&#xD;
seemition, and the affair began to make a uQise. Old&#xD;
Dr. Wilkins had never believed John's guilt, and,&#xD;
having studied the indications of circumstances for&#xD;
sonic time, caine at last to a conclusion with regard&#xD;
to who were the instigators of the accusation.&#xD;
Sir Henry Gordon was the person who prosecuted&#xD;
John. The wily old doctor laid a trap for him to&#xD;
&#xD;
bring him to confession. lie knew very well that,&#xD;
in the sight of aristocracy at least, it was no crime to&#xD;
dispose of an Irishman and he know, too, that some&#xD;
of the aristocracy were not above superstition, lie&#xD;
meant to see what he could make out from these two&#xD;
starting-points. The doctor took occasion to visit his&#xD;
old friend and brother mason, Gen. Arsdale, who,&#xD;
besides being a brave man and warm friend, was fond&#xD;
of having sport, when the expense to his victim was&#xD;
not too great. His victim in the present instance&#xD;
was one he had little compassion for; and accord-&#xD;
ingly entered into the doctor's plans with great relish.&#xD;
The doctor and himself were to make a tour of a por-&#xD;
tion of the country most noted for being haunted by&#xD;
ghosts, with the pretended object of seeing some old&#xD;
-~ruins. Sir henry was invited to accompany them;&#xD;
although he would have chosen some other destina-&#xD;
tion than this, he could not ~vell refuse.&#xD;
They had a very pleasant ride, enlivened by the&#xD;
wit and humor of the general, who, as they came&#xD;
near castle liurnes, all at once changed the conversa-&#xD;
tion to the subject of ghosts, which were the terror of&#xD;
that portion of the country. The doctor ridiculed the&#xD;
belief in apparitions, and the general agreed with&#xD;
him that they were a great humbug. But, Sir&#xD;
henry thought differently. He ~vas positive there&#xD;
were ghosts, for he had himself scen one; and he&#xD;
thought it was wrong to doubt such things, and apt&#xD;
to cause them to appear. The general laughed&#xD;
derisively, and very much to Sir henry's disniay,&#xD;
began challenging the ghosts of castle Ilurnes, coni-&#xD;
manding them, if there ~vere any, to appear. The&#xD;

words were hardly spoken, when, advancing through&#xD;
tine dim light of a moonless evening, a tall figure, all&#xD;
in white, made its appearance. Sir henry and his&#xD;
horse were both terribly alarmed; and, after a&#xD;
plunge or two on the part of the horse, Sir henry&#xD;
found himself on the ground. Immediately the&#xD;
sl)ectre seized him in its long gaunt arms, and he&#xD;
fainted. But the apparition, which was a very&#xD;
methodical one, soon revived him, and proceeded to&#xD;
inquire of him, in ghostly tones, what part lie had&#xD;
taken in the accusation and conviction of John&#xD;
Woods. The guilty Sir IJenry, completely fright-&#xD;
ened out of his wits, confessed the whole plot; and&#xD;
J)romised repentance and penance. But this did not&#xD;
satisfy the exacting spectre, who assured him in the&#xD;
most sepulchral tones, that unless he immediately&#xD;
made public confession, and cleared an innocent man&#xD;
from disgrace, lie had only a short time to live.&#xD;
Poor Sir Ihlenry! lie was quite exhausted with terror&#xD;
when the doctor and general caine to his assistance,&#xD;
which they were careful not to do until his confession&#xD;
and promise had been obtained. Then, affecting to&#xD;
have been bewildered iii the darkness, they made their&#xD;
way to where he lay, quite exhausted, and assisted him&#xD;
to remount his horse, which had not gone far away.&#xD;
his friends ~y~ere very kind to him, and immedi-&#xD;
ately accompanied him back to the general's house,&#xD;
pretending to think it was the fall that had put him&#xD;
in such a condition. They said nothing about having&#xD;
seen anything extraordinary, well knowing that the&#xD;
popular belief is that no two persons see an appari-&#xD;
tion at the same time. But the unhappy man&#xD;

recollected his promise to confess, or die in a few&#xD;
days; and there was no way left but to make a clean&#xD;
breast of it.&#xD;
Even private confession failed to bring security,&#xD;
and he fell ill at Gen. Arsdell's. Dr. Wilkins gave him&#xD;
every attention; and the priest, old Father Smith,&#xD;
was called in to ease his soul. Father Smith told&#xD;
him his confession was not public enough to satisfy&#xD;
tIne ghost, and that he had no power to comfort him,&#xD;
until the spirit was satisfied. The Church of Rome&#xD;
had power over spirits of some kinds, but this one&#xD;
appeared to be of an order very much dreaded; and his&#xD;
only way to escape its torments, and prevent its reap-&#xD;
pearance, was to fulfill its injunctions to the very letter.&#xD;
All this was rare sport to the two men who had&#xD;
planned the ghost, though they regretted the neces-&#xD;
sity of using such means to procure justice. Mr.&#xD;
XVoods was informed of the result of their experiment,&#xD;
and deeply regretted his coldness to his son, and his&#xD;
difficulty with his wife, since the same ~CVSOllS were&#xD;
doubtless to blame for both. He threatened, should&#xD;
Sir Henry recover, to treat him to another ghost.&#xD;
But the one he had was more than he could endure,&#xD;
and, after consulting the priests in vain, he fell into&#xD;
a decline and died. The three l)C~5Oll5 who under-&#xD;
stood his complaint, kept their own counsel, thinking&#xD;
his life not worth saving. Before his death, his&#xD;
friends proposed the sacrament, and Mr. Hamilton&#xD;
was sent for to administer it; but in his ravings lie&#xD;
made some accusations against that gentleman, which&#xD;
so displeased him that he retired. Bishop Fredonia&#xD;

Lord Charles Elia was somewhat troubled by time&#xD;

lIe had been accustomed to look upon religion as a&#xD;

regarded by the English government as the priests&#xD;
were by the people of Rome. The queen was head&#xD;
of the Established Church, as much as the pope was&#xD;
head of the Church of Rome. Oh, for a glimpse of&#xD;
the truth! In Parliament, infidels, deists, unbelievers&#xD;

stand up and blacken the name of Cunningham with&#xD;
his infamous lies, just as well as if he were an up.&#xD;
right man and Christian gentleman. There was no&#xD;
intrinsic power in virtue. It got no more respect&#xD;

Lord Charles consulted his father about Gordon's&#xD;
case. The old lord had no doubt whatever that the&#xD;
ghost of Lord Cunningham had actually beaten Sir&#xD;
henry, and threatened him with his d~math. Ihul&#xD;
Cunningham beemi alive, Gordon could have held his&#xD;
own with lAin ; but being dead he had time power.&#xD;
It was a most remarkable demonstration ; but not&#xD;
more so than what had occurred to Sir Robert&#xD;
Nelson, who had also been attacked, and had his am'ni&#xD;
broken in three places by the spirit of Gordon, for&#xD;
inducing him, while in this life, to be guilty of&#xD;
injuring an innocent you~mg man in the way Woods&#xD;
had been injured. Nelson, who was another victim&#xD;
of superstition, which is bred in the bone of Catholic&#xD;
communities, even tinder the eye of the established&#xD;
church, was xvell enough convinced that his punish-&#xD;

with the servants, was likely to find avengers, and he&#xD;

attended to his wOtln(lccl arm, learned sernething of&#xD;
his state of mind, and mischievously recommende(l&#xD;
him to have Nelly come and take off the spell. The&#xD;
doctor, in the meantime, instructed Nelly as to lici'&#xD;
cue, and gave her liberty to make as much out of her&#xD;
victim as she could. The weird old woman was&#xD;
nothing loath to undertake her part, being in want of&#xD;
the means to have a .9pree, and make reparation foi&#xD;
the number of deaths that had lately passed un-&#xD;
lio~~ored by a wake. !The hideous looks and affected&#xD;
notions of the old witch put Nelson into such a fever&#xD;
that he could not endure her in the room ; but she&#xD;
was not to be trifled with, and acted her part better&#xD;
than many more intelligent persons could have done.&#xD;
She called upon him to confess all his sins before&#xD;
witnesses; and after they were recorded, (lrew blood&#xD;
from his arm that he might sign what he had con-&#xD;
fessed in the red ink the htiries love. Bat she (lid&#xD;
not confer upon him the repoSe for which he had&#xD;
endured this horrible trial. Instead of removing the&#xD;
spell as he expected, she pronounced upon him and&#xD;
all his race a terrible curse. This was too fearful a&#xD;
punishment, when it is considered that his faith in the&#xD;
potency of blessings and curses was implicit. The&#xD;
miserable man writhed and suffered under the curse&#xD;

from being a man of little intellect, lie became a&#xD;

It turned out in the case of James Green, that they&#xD;
have reason for their fears. Green being of a skep-&#xD;
tical turn of mind, took the liberty of doubting the&#xD;
reality of the spirits who attacked Sir Robert in so&#xD;
palpable a manuel', awl ventured to express his un-&#xD;
belief.&#xD;
Not long after, a noise in the night attracted his&#xD;
attention, and upon rc~)airi1Ig to the 51)ot whence the&#xD;
sound proceeded, he saw a circle of hundreds of the&#xD;
"good people" dancing and fiddling. They paid 110&#xD;
attention to hiiii until upon the close of their revels,&#xD;
when the skeptical young man attempting to follow&#xD;
them, they hastily in~ide a hearse of straws, and&#xD;
mounting him upon it, compelled him to ride all over&#xD;
Ireland, England and Scotland. At least that was&#xD;
the story which became current!&#xD;

&#xD;
too powerful an instrument to be rejected if it could&#xD;
help him to accomplish his long cherished object of&#xD;
helping John Woods to l~i~ liberty. General Arsdell,&#xD;
too, was embarked in the same enterprise. The&#xD;
genei'al had seine hopes of procuring John's pardon.&#xD;
lie felt that his word ought to have some weight with&#xD;
the Irish parliament, though personally a stranger to&#xD;
the new Lord Lieutenant. Lord Fowler had resigned&#xD;
upon becoming satisfied that the step lie had taken&#xD;
in endorsing his son's mixed marriage, he had dis-&#xD;
pleased many of his friends, and weakened his influ-&#xD;
ence with the aristocracy. Reports of his having&#xD;
become a Roman Catholic were set afloat by the&#xD;
English residents, which in a considerable degree&#xD;
hurt his standing among the Irish Protestants. The&#xD;
entire north of Ireland was loud in denouncing him&#xD;
at the time of the first terrible distress caused by the&#xD;
potato rot, and called for him to make some effort to&#xD;
relieve the sufferings of the people.&#xD;
He saw that the collection' of i'ents, cuts and tithes&#xD;
at such a time was unjust and cruel, and that while&#xD;
such demands were being made, it was difficult to&#xD;
preserve peace among the best subjects. lie made&#xD;
an effort, at this time, to introduce into the British&#xD;
Parliament a bill, asking for the suspension of taxa-&#xD;
tion for the present year, and until the crops were&#xD;
bettor. IJe was severely repulsed for proposing such&#xD;
a measure, and instead of anything being done to al-&#xD;
leviate the sufferings of the people, the i4abeas COP2?~8&#xD;
act was suspended, and large bodies of troops sent to&#xD;
preserve the peace, to prevent mutiny and complaint&#xD;
among the starving Irish. The suspension of this&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
act gave an opportunity to hang up the sufferer in his&#xD;
last moments, if lie rebelled against his destiny.&#xD;
This soldier~goverllfflCnt is another one of Irehuid's&#xD;
distresses. These vagabonds who are placed on the&#xD;
island to guard its interests, are continually avengilig&#xD;
on the people the slights received from the virtuous,&#xD;
humble poor, who will not allo~v their daughters to&#xD;
associate with them. It is no unconnuon thing for&#xD;
these scoundrels to look out families who have eaten&#xD;
their last mouthful of food, and, making capital out&#xD;
of their necessities, promise aid, and profess love,&#xD;
until ~ne of the daughters is prevailed upon to ac-&#xD;
cept proposals of marriage, which is represented to&#xD;
be honorable and binding; but which, at the end of&#xD;
a few weeks or' months, is thrown up as worthless,&#xD;
and the poor, deceived and deserted girl left to take&#xD;
care of herself. Any one in the British Islands has&#xD;
a better chance for a living than a soldier's wife, es-&#xD;
pecially a soldier's wife in Ireland.&#xD;
Lord Fowler wished to check these iniquitous pm'o-&#xD;
ceedings if possible; but the government thought&#xD;
best not to restrain the soldiers, for fear the army&#xD;
could not be sustained without pre&amp;amp;sng more men&#xD;
than would be desirable. Finding himself opposed&#xD;
and misrepresented on every hand, Lord Fowler soon&#xD;
resigned; and a new incumbent, after the g vern-&#xD;
inent's own heart, came into his place. The new&#xD;
lieutenant, living at Dublin Castle in state, with a&#xD;
chancellor and secretary, and a royal household es-&#xD;
tablishment generally, was hardly as good a man, as&#xD;
Fowler in his old age had learned to be.&#xD;
Still, General Arsdeil, full of a desire to do some-&#xD;

thing for John Woods, flatters himself lie may be&#xD;
able to acconipli~1i his desire by seeing the Lord&#xD;
Lieutenant. Sir henry Gordon's confession, taken&#xD;
in due form, was presented to his excellence. But&#xD;
his lordship was of opinion it would not be safe to&#xD;
grant the pardon; as this was a death-bed confession,&#xD;
and the sick man might not have been in his right&#xD;
mind. Should the prisoner prove hhnself ~vel1 he-&#xD;
have(l in every respect, lie might l)al'don him just&#xD;
before the expiration of his term, to save him the&#xD;
disgrace of a full vrin; more than that he could not&#xD;
promise to do. lie, Ii however, permitted the general&#xD;
to see and talk with the prisoner, which was a great&#xD;
favor to the latter, lie found him very responding,&#xD;
and bitter in his feelings toward his enemies; even&#xD;
threutcniiig to rake his revenge on them when once&#xD;
more at liberty, it' lie had to return and serve out the&#xD;
remainder of his life in prison to atone for it. But&#xD;
the general sOon put him in a better state of mnimid&#xD;
by recounting to him what had already befallen some&#xD;
of his enemies; and by enlisting his sympathies in&#xD;
the unknown fitte of Marion. John listened with&#xD;
eager interest to the recital of the events which had&#xD;
happened during his confinement; particularly to&#xD;
that which concerned Marion and her sentiments&#xD;
towar(l him. lie was glad she was gone to America,&#xD;
where lie had some hope of some time joining hem'.&#xD;
(leimeral Arsdell assured him lie might legendd upon&#xD;
he~' comistancy, for she had shown all along the most&#xD;
indonutable determination to contend for her liberty&#xD;

indeed, he found it hard to conform to the belief's or&#xD;
requirements of the Church. For instance he had&#xD;
been in battle, where every Christian counnandifleilt&#xD;
is vjolated ; yet, he could not bring himself to repent&#xD;
and abhor his sins there committed, as he supposed&#xD;
he ought to (10. NeverthelesS, his real sentiments of&#xD;
right came much nearer to the true Christian's stan-&#xD;
dard than those held by many of the high Church&#xD;
people ; aud us he had some fears that John wouhl&#xD;
accuse God of foreordainilig all this train of injury&#xD;
and suffering, and thereby lose confidence in hint, he&#xD;
endeavored to set the matter in its true light before&#xD;
the young man's mind. Nor was the old soldier s&#xD;
instruction without its merit in John's case. The&#xD;
prisoner's features gradually lost their expression of&#xD;
stony despair, as the lesson went on; and, finally, he&#xD;
declared himself very much renovated in spirit by&#xD;
this timely sympathy and advice.&#xD;
The fate of those unprincipled mcii who had helped&#xD;
to bring on his misfortunes, was as shocking as his&#xD;
own sufferings. lie had never believed in a special&#xD;
providence; but the way in which punishment seemed&#xD;
tollowitig upon sin, in the case of his enemies, almost&#xD;
persiia(lCd him of the truth of proVi(lCiitial interposi-&#xD;
tion. Lady Fredonia had certainly met with justice,&#xD;
and found herself as much a victim of 1)ersecutioii as&#xD;
once she had (lehghte(l to make others.&#xD;
With this recolleCtioll to give him confidence in&#xD;
God, and the knowledge that lie was cared for by a&#xD;
few firm friends, raised up John from the depths of&#xD;
revengefUl despair into which he had been thrown&#xD;

promised rio more to reproach God, but to try to&#xD;
keep his heart right, and see 'that his disposition was&#xD;
not spoiled in the endurance of injustice, lie would&#xD;
forget his own trials in remembering the unprotected&#xD;
situation of Marion; and the uncertainty of her fate&#xD;
would nerve him to endure the hardships of his con-&#xD;
dition. Imprisonment in Ireland is more dreaded&#xD;
than hanging, owing to the horrible cruelties pI'ac-&#xD;
tised on the prisoners ; cruelties, the description of&#xD;
which in this place, woulti be more shocking than&#xD;
necessary. Suffice it that John resolved to endure&#xD;
anything that might come to an end, in the hope of&#xD;
being of. use to Marion, when he should regain his&#xD;
liberty.&#xD;
To speak, read or think of exhibitions of cruelty,&#xD;
with no other Ol)ject than the gratification of our curi-&#xD;
osity, is but a doubtful manner of amusing ourselves.&#xD;
There is little enough care taken of our sensibilities;&#xD;
a care which should l)e greatly increased. The&#xD;
degree to which use deadens sensibility is hardly&#xD;
credible except by those experienced in its effects.&#xD;
One cause which makes the British such savages in&#xD;
war, is the flict of their being taught from the cradle&#xD;
all the monstrous acts of all those who have lived&#xD;
before them, and educated to think it a mark of brav-&#xD;
ery to be cruel. If a soldier is to be flayed alive, it&#xD;
is a scene of public entertainment, for the rich and&#xD;
the poor; and the person who counts most correctly&#xD;
the blows as they fall, and can tell how far the blood&#xD;
spirts, with most unerring certainty, is set down as the&#xD;
person of strongest mind.&#xD;
Gen. Arsdell used to say it was this kind of train-&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN T~VO WORLDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
141&#xD;
&#xD;
ing which enabled him to take the part he did take in&#xD;
the war with the United States in 1S12. Under Gen.&#xD;
Proctor he learned lessons of fiendish cruelty impos-&#xD;
sible for him to have imagined; and confessed that he&#xD;
learned to look upon a string of scalps on a pole as&#xD;
the most gratifying sight possible ! It was the same&#xD;
with all the soldiers in that war. A scalp, stretched&#xD;
over a hoop, four inches in diameter, anti ~dried,&#xD;
and Painte~l inside, was a trinket which they prized&#xD;
above all others. Such was the memory of this&#xD;
devilish excitement, that Arsdell confessed his reason&#xD;
anti judgment were insufficient even yet to subdue&#xD;
the exultation caused by the recollection; and t-hat&#xD;
the humanity he sought to cultivate was purely arti-&#xD;
ficial, though he knew it to be right. A terrible con-&#xD;
fession to come from a man naturally of so kind a&#xD;
heart!&#xD;
On leaving the priSon, Gen. Arsdehl procured the&#xD;
1)rOluise of the superintendent to 1)er11~it John to re-&#xD;
ceive any message of consequence which might come&#xD;
from Marion Cunningham, as well as an assurance&#xD;
that, what could, would be done to alleviate his situ-&#xD;
tion. But, withal, the l)rospect for either John or&#xD;
Marion was dark enough when the nature of their&#xD;
enemies was considered.&#xD;
Lord Charles Elia, whose concern for the fate of&#xD;
Sir Henry Gordon had tlriveii him to ask spiritual&#xD;
advice of the bishop, had been adapted to the uses&#xD;
and designs of his reverence, in the same manner&#xD;
that others had been before him. After healing the&#xD;
wounds, made by sin in Lord Elia's conscience, he&#xD;
conversed with him on the subject of the late pro-&#xD;

ceedings of Lord Cunningham and lady Fredonia.&#xD;
lie has come to the conclusion that it is necessary, in&#xD;
order to establish good domestic govern mont; to get&#xD;
the conti'ol of her ladyship's mind, through fear 01'&#xD;
otherwise, as seems mumost expedient. This confidence&#xD;
on the l)al't of the bishop met with a wam'm return&#xD;
from Lord Charles. lie believes he has more power&#xD;
either to amuioy or console her ladyship, as tIme case&#xD;
requires, than any other person; and m'eadily enters&#xD;
into a scheme for Lady Fredonia's better government.&#xD;
Lord Charles was, it will be recollected, a suitor of&#xD;
Marion's at a time when her parents preferred the&#xD;
Duke of-; and lie still affected to retain a great&#xD;
regard for her. Witim the bishop's consent he con-&#xD;
sulted lady Fm'edonia on the subject of searching for&#xD;
her daughter-a plan that had occupied her ladyship's&#xD;
thoughts altogether since tIme inroad of the bishop's&#xD;
daughters upon her house and comfort. These dis-&#xD;
agreeable and overbearing persons afforded her a&#xD;
pointed contrast to what her own (laughter might&#xD;
have been to her, had she cultivated the natural con-&#xD;
fidence of a child's heart toward its mother. Bitter,&#xD;
indeed, has been the lesson, and late-perhaps too&#xD;
fatally late-but she will make what reparation is in&#xD;
her power to make. Anxiously looked the penitent&#xD;
woman for the return of the ship Albion to the port&#xD;
of Gahway; and anxiously did she question Captain&#xD;
Robinson concerning her daughter, beggimug him to&#xD;
give her address, that money mi ght be sent to her.&#xD;
But the captain, fearing some stratagem, and faithful&#xD;
to his instructions, refused to impart any information&#xD;
concerning the young lady except al her command.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
143&#xD;
&#xD;
This reserve on the part of Captain IRobinson foiled&#xD;
~dl attempts to discover Marion's whereabouts, through&#xD;
the only source she knew ot. her ladyship then&#xD;
conceived the plan of Coining to America in person&#xD;
to look for her. l3ut, in this (lesign she was steadily&#xD;
opposed by the bishop; his oj)position, however,&#xD;
being on the ground of imprudence and impractica-&#xD;
bility. Therefore, when Lord Charles Elia 1)reSented&#xD;
himself as her agent, and pretended to be actuated by&#xD;
the sincerest affection for Marion, in doing so, her&#xD;
ladyship was placed in extreme difficulty. She was&#xD;
well aware that, by consenting to snch an arrange-&#xD;
ment, she gave her sanction to the suit of Lord&#xD;
Charles; and she knew, at the same time, that no-&#xD;
thing could be more displeasing to Marion than that he&#xD;
should come invested with this claim upon her.&#xD;
Neither would it be acknowledged, she felt sure; but&#xD;
the temptation to get her daugli~er back, by any&#xD;
means, was too great to be easily resisted.&#xD;
Mcan~~'hile, Lord Charles urged his request, and&#xD;
the bishop sanctioned and encouraged the scheme.&#xD;
How bitterly lady Fredonia regretted her former&#xD;
severity with her daughter! The more she delib-&#xD;
erated, time more her trouble increased. The bishop&#xD;
on one hand, setting forth the dangers that beset the&#xD;
path of young womanhood in Marion's m~protected&#xD;
situation ; and the means whereby to 1)revail upon her&#xD;
to return, on the other. She felt that to send Lord&#xD;
Ehia to Marion ~vouhd be to juliet upon lieu' a real&#xD;
calamity; while to refuse to do so would hrhvr down&#xD;
on herself the enmity of the unprincipled lord and his&#xD;

that the causes of complaint did not come within the&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
LORD ChARLES ELlA landed at Quebec fully assum'ed&#xD;
he should find Marion Cunningham without any diffi-&#xD;
culty. He had little idea of the extent of territory&#xD;
he might have to travel over, nor of the difficulties&#xD;
of such travel, with the object he had in view. He&#xD;
used but little good sense or discretion in making his&#xD;
inquiries.&#xD;
Among those to whom he was referred as a shrewd,&#xD;
vigilaiit assistant, was an original character from the&#xD;
United States, named Bill Davis, a Green Mountain&#xD;
boy-a sort of strolling trader, who, under a rough&#xD;
exterior, concealed a vast deal of shrewdness and&#xD;
spirit. From what he heard and observed of Lord&#xD;
Elia's ~no~v plain Elia~ proceedings, he conjectured&#xD;
that it would be doing no harm to have relations&#xD;
with him, and therefore listened favorably to the pro-&#xD;
posals of the lord. With true Yankee quickness, he&#xD;
matured his plans for getting both profit and amuse-&#xD;
ment out of him. On the other hand, Elia judged&#xD;
from Bill's appearance that it was a great condescen-&#xD;
sion for him to have any business with lAin what-&#xD;
ever; only the necessities of tile case made it impor-&#xD;
taut to secure his services, as lie was now convinced&#xD;
they would be valuable. With this mutual good&#xD;
understanding, the acquaintance progressed. lie&#xD;
used no reserve in explaining his purposes to his&#xD;

&#xD;
Yankee confederate. This confidence was plentifully&#xD;
bedewed with pi'oinises of reward, and with pota-&#xD;
tions which lii~ lordship from time to time ordered.&#xD;
Elia's knowledge of Americans, aside from a little&#xD;
information concerning Washington and Franklin,&#xD;
was very meagre indeed. That men who were not&#xD;
lords could be high-souled, independent gentlemen,&#xD;
never had occurred to hirn--inucli less, that a long,&#xD;
lank, rough-looking fellow, who had never been in&#xD;
Britain, could have an idea he was as much of a man&#xD;
as a live lord. It fell out, therefore, that some of the&#xD;
questions put to him by Davis were considered im-&#xD;
pertinent, and Elia was indiscreet enough to tell him&#xD;
so; adding a threat to "chastise him if lie continued&#xD;
his ifl8oleflce."&#xD;
"By gracious! I am ready to be chastised, if you&#xD;
think you can do it," answered Davis, his eyes flash-&#xD;
ing fire.&#xD;
Liquor had made Elia a little obtuse in his percep-&#xD;
tions, and lie was bold enough to take his antagonist&#xD;
by the hair, when a well-directed blow from till&#xD;
Davis' huge fist extracted two of his front teeth, and&#xD;
otherwise mutilated his countenance. Davis was in-&#xD;
stantly sorry he had punished a drunken lord so&#xD;
severely, and made haste to bathe his face, and do&#xD;
what he could for his comfort.&#xD;
This little exhibition of pugilism was very much&#xD;
relished by a crowd of Irishmen, whose native in-&#xD;
stincts make them love a good fighter, and Bill Davis&#xD;
became quite a lion. Indeed, wherever h~ went, in his&#xD;
character of Yankee trader, he succeeded in making&#xD;
his national peculiarities felt. Going into an office&#xD;
&#xD;
in Montreal to transact some business, one of the&#xD;
otheerS observed that he did not remove his hat, and&#xD;
ordered liiiim to do so without delay. his command&#xD;
not l)eing obeyed, the officer knocked oft' the offend-&#xD;
ing hat with the point of his sword. Bill procee'~le(l&#xD;
with his business. When the transaction was coni-&#xD;
pleted, be turned around, and in a tone not to be mis-&#xD;
taken ordered the officer to pick up his hat or take a&#xD;
thrashing. The queen's officer, being convinced that&#xD;
discretion was the better part of valor, rather surlily&#xD;
returned Bill his hat. This was not long after tho&#xD;
patriot war, and there was not the bost of feeling ex-&#xD;
isting between the people of the States and Canada.&#xD;
Many of the Americans residing in Canada had lost&#xD;
friends and property during the disturbances. Bill&#xD;
D~ivis being among that number, therefore he was not&#xD;
particularly well-disposed toward the queen's subjects.&#xD;
had Elia understood perfectly the sort of estima-&#xD;
tion in which he was held by such men as Bill Davis&#xD;
and others of his countrymen, he would, probably,&#xD;
have been more discreet. Unfortunately for him, he&#xD;
was in that unsophisticated state a freshly-imported&#xD;
Irish lord is always in danger of being, and often&#xD;
gave utterance to sentiments not quite orthodox&#xD;
among Americans. His first mistake having resulted&#xD;
so seriously, he would have been glad to have dis-&#xD;
pensed with any further acquaintance with persons&#xD;
of this description, had lie not been led to suppose&#xD;
his hope of finding Marion Cunningham depended&#xD;
upon cultivating a better acquaintance with Bill&#xD;
Davis-an opinion Bill cunningly fostered by many&#xD;
carefully-studied remarks.&#xD;

&#xD;
Elia, having conquered his repugnance to his friend&#xD;
of such startling prowess, finally commenced over-&#xD;
tures upon the subject of being furnished with infom'-&#xD;
niation regarding tke Miss Cunningham whom Davis&#xD;
knew so much about; and was assured by Bill lie&#xD;
could obtain no further information from him until&#xD;
he was made acquainted with the case in all&#xD;
its particulars, as informing on young ladies in&#xD;
the United States, without good and sufficient rea-&#xD;
sons, was enough to entitle a man to a "ride on a&#xD;
rail."&#xD;
In answer to Ehia's inquiries as to what manner&#xD;
of excursion this might be, Bill gave a thrilling, yet&#xD;
graphic description of this national amusement, very&#xD;
munch to his listener's edificatiomi, and consternation,&#xD;
too, for Bill did miot disguise the truth that there was&#xD;
some danger of his lordship being honored by this&#xD;
ceremony, should lie be foumid engaged in any under-&#xD;
handed proceedings with regard to Miss Cunmiinghiam.&#xD;
The result of this caution on the part of Bill was to&#xD;
procure an offer from Elia of the entire agency in the&#xD;
affair, with assurances of a sufficient reward in case&#xD;
he succeeded in restoring Miss Cunningham to his&#xD;
guardianship. Being thus taken into his lordship's&#xD;
confidence, Bill begati to work the wires to suit his&#xD;
plans of gain and amusement together.&#xD;
No sooner had he heard Ehia's story, and guessed&#xD;
at the probable amount of sincerity and principle in&#xD;
his lordship's mind, than he suddenly came out with&#xD;
the confession that the story was known to him be-&#xD;
fore; and, not only so, but Miss Cunningham, from&#xD;
having placed confidence in him, had more recently&#xD;
&#xD;
148&#xD;
&#xD;
149&#xD;
&#xD;
become attached to him, and he hoped soon to make&#xD;
her his wife&#xD;
Marion Cunningham yOU,. wife !" exclaimed&#xD;
Elia, his aristocratic instincts violently aroused.&#xD;
"Presumptuous villain! I ought to punish you for&#xD;
your insolence."&#xD;
"Suppose you try that, Mr. Lord," coolly replied&#xD;
Bill. "This is a free country-at least on our side&#xD;
the line, and we generally love who we please and&#xD;
marry who we can. If Miss Cunningham thinks she&#xD;
likes inc next best to that Woods whom you got into&#xD;
prison, and I like her, and am likely to get a nice&#xD;
little property with her, I should like to know how&#xD;
you are going to interfere in the matter. In this&#xD;
country we usually arrange these matters to suit our-&#xD;
selves, and do not submit to be called scoundrels&#xD;
either. If you behave yourself like a gentleman, you&#xD;
may get an invitation to the wedding on the ground&#xD;
of old acquaintanceship."&#xD;
With this condescending remark Bill closed the&#xD;
interview, and left Quebec without delay, calculating&#xD;
that Elia would be on the alert to observe his move-&#xD;
ments. Nor was his judgment of the man wrong;&#xD;
for he had not left the city many miles behind, before&#xD;
Lord Charles was upon his track, attended only by&#xD;
one servant. He was led on by the hope of being&#xD;
able to surprise Marion, and get her away, upon the&#xD;

when he had arrived at a little towir in Vermont&#xD;
near the New York line, suddenly increased his&#xD;
travelling party by the addition of a mysterious&#xD;
female, and three male attendants.&#xD;
With these companions he hastened over to White-&#xD;
hall, New York, with Elia close at his heels, fully&#xD;
assured that, unless he made all possible haste, Ma-&#xD;
rion would be lost to him forever. Upon arriving at&#xD;
Whitehall, the lady and her party were nowhere&#xD;
visible, but Bill Davis was cosily smoking his cigar&#xD;
at the principal hotel, lie appeared surprised to see&#xD;
his lordship so soon after parting from hini at&#xD;
Quebec, arid consented, with a feigned reluctance, to&#xD;
have a private interview with him.&#xD;
"Now," said his lordship, "I am certain you wish&#xD;
to marry Miss Cunningham to obtain her fortune.&#xD;
But, it is very doubtful whether you would be able&#xD;
to get possession of it during your lifetime ; for, of&#xD;
course it would be contested by her relatives, who&#xD;
would be outraged by her marrying a person of no&#xD;
birth. To save you all this trouble and disappoint-&#xD;
ment, and to secure you a comfortable fortune mi-&#xD;
mediately, I propose to pay you a satisfactory sum&#xD;
for assisting me to g~t possessioir of Miss Cunning-&#xD;
ham, whom I have promised to return to her mother&#xD;
in Ireland, at the earliest moment possible. What&#xD;
do you say to the coInh)rolnise?"&#xD;
I say it can't be done," said Bill positivelyy : "for,&#xD;
providing I was willing to give the young lady up,&#xD;
which I aint, you could never get her away with you&#xD;
in all creation. She would sooner die than go to&#xD;
Ireland while sonic of tlmemii folks is livin'."&#xD;

&#xD;
"But, suppose she had to go-that she could not&#xD;
help it?" said Elm.&#xD;
" Oh, you don't think I am going to help kidnap&#xD;
a gii'l, do you ?" asked Bill, indignantly.&#xD;
Perhaps not, exactly," answered Ehia; "but,&#xD;
couldn't you contrive to deceive her a little, for her&#xD;
own (rood? For instance, cannot you get up a hurried&#xD;
marriage, and substitute mc for the bridegroom-or&#xD;
something of this sort? You have heard of such&#xD;
things, I presume ?"&#xD;
"The devil 1 have I" shouted Bill. "Do you think&#xD;
I am going to Jo as mean a piece of business as&#xD;
that? I should like to see the color of your gold&#xD;
first."&#xD;
"Very well; how much shall it be-a thousand&#xD;
pounds ?"&#xD;
"A thousand, indeed! I wouldn't do it for twiec&#xD;
that amount."&#xD;
Perhaps you will for three times that amount?&#xD;
Come, three thousand pounds ought to make you&#xD;
very comfortable here in the States, and enable you&#xD;
to marry whom you please."&#xD;
"It's a dirty, mean business," said Bill, reluctantly;&#xD;
"and I don't like to marry a girl to a man against her&#xD;
wishes; but, perhaps it would be a good thing for&#xD;
her, after all. I'll take time to consider on iL"&#xD;
This was a very satisfactory conclusion of the&#xD;
negotiation as far as Eli2 was concerliC(l ; as lie had 110&#xD;
doubt about the final result of the compromise. Pill&#xD;
took a day to consider about it, when lie returned with&#xD;
the following plan: Elia was to give him a check&#xD;
for the three thousand, in return for which lie was to&#xD;

&#xD;
secure his (Elia's) marriage with Miss Cunningham&#xD;
by stratagem, within a week. But, in addition to&#xD;
the money paid to him, Elia must select a pretty&#xD;
farm in the State of New York, buy it amid deed it to&#xD;
his wife beforehand. This was to satisfy Bill's con-&#xD;
science, who said Miss Cunningham might prove&#xD;
refractory after marriage; he could not promise that&#xD;
she would be pleased with her husband, and it would&#xD;
not be fair to marry a woman and get all her pro-&#xD;
perty, without settling something oti her! Elia&#xD;
thought there was something reasonable in this, al-&#xD;
though the draft upon his purse was rather heavy.&#xD;
He consoled himself with the recollection of Marion's&#xD;
six hundred thousand which was to balance it, and&#xD;
finally consented. After the bargain had been coin-&#xD;
pleted, Bill congratulated his lordship on the hap-&#xD;
piness lie would have. "I should hate to be in your&#xD;
shoes," said he to Elia, "for that woman is awful&#xD;
high-spirited, and will make you some trouble, I&#xD;
haven't any doubt. You'd better be kind o' careful&#xD;
of her at first, or she'll fly all to pieces with spite, at&#xD;
finding it aint me she's married to."&#xD;
This advice was very good humoredly received by&#xD;
Lord Charles, who had his own opinion about&#xD;
Marion's high spirits. But lie thought he might&#xD;
venture to try them, since lie had all things in&#xD;
readiness to place her ladyship in safe keeping,&#xD;
should she prove too difficult to appease. The time&#xD;
approached for the marriage, which was to be per-&#xD;
formed at a house in the country, under very roman-&#xD;
tic circumstances. Bill said he had persuaded his&#xD;
bride that it would be highly sentimental to be&#xD;
&#xD;
married by starlight, in an arbor, at the foot of the&#xD;
garden. Accordingly, when the hour for the cere-&#xD;
mony arrived, Elia, disguised to resemble Bill as&#xD;
closely as possible and attended by that dignitary as&#xD;
groomsman, repaired to the arbor where the few&#xD;
witnesses were assembled, and where the dim light&#xD;
made recognitioii nearly impossible. Bill, knowing&#xD;
that it would not be proper for Elia to speak for fear&#xD;
of being betrayed by his voice, secretly hurried on&#xD;
the affair through the person who was to give the&#xD;
bride away and the officiating minister, who called&#xD;
upon the parties to come forward and be united in&#xD;
matrimony almost as soon as the gentleman ap-&#xD;
peared. The ceremony was performed after the man-&#xD;
ner of the Episcopal Church, and the responses made&#xD;
in tones so low and constrained as not to be recog-&#xD;
nized by either party.&#xD;
When the couple were pronounced man and wife,&#xD;
the company proceeded to the house, the bridegroom&#xD;
whispering all sorts of suitable assurances in the&#xD;
bride's ear on the way. Arrived at the house, the&#xD;
happy couple stepped forth into the Ii o'ht of haifa dozen&#xD;
tallow candles. Lo! the consternation of Charles&#xD;
Ehia, lord! By the hand he held a scrubby, pock-&#xD;
marked, red-haired, sour visaged Irish girl-wife of&#xD;
Lord Charles Ehia, and owner in her own right of a&#xD;
pleasant farm in the State of ~ew York.&#xD;
" Zounds! what is this ?" cried his lordship, drop-&#xD;
ping her hand and stepping back.&#xD;
"What do you mean, sir ?" asked the person who&#xD;
had given her away.&#xD;
"I mean that this is not Marion Wallace Cunning-&#xD;

ham, the lady I presumed I was marrying," ans-&#xD;
weredElia, angrily.&#xD;
"This young lady's name was Marion Cunning-&#xD;
ham; it is now Lady Marion Elia, by your leave,"&#xD;
interrupted Bill; "a darned sight too good for such&#xD;
a creature as you.~~&#xD;
"Scoundrel, do you call me a creature after this&#xD;
imposition! Do you forget who I am&#xD;
"Not by a long-shot," retorted Bill. "I have&#xD;
kept that in mind since I first met you-that yo~t are&#xD;
a d-d scoundrel-not me. I have had a long enough&#xD;
acquaintance with you now. This girl here, if&#xD;
you treat her well, is your wife; if not she can get a&#xD;
divorce from you, and alimony to boot. But, be&#xD;
precious careful how you carry yourself in this free&#xD;
and independent State of New York, or we'll treat&#xD;
you yet to a ride on a rail I"&#xD;
At mention of this terrible punishment, kept in&#xD;
readiness by United States savages for men who&#xD;
wanted to kidnap either niggers or white girls, Elia&#xD;
was silent.&#xD;
Could Elia have known his wife's early history, he&#xD;
would have had the satisfiiction of knowing that she&#xD;
was named for the identical Marion Wallace Cnn-&#xD;
ningham he was in search of, she being one of the&#xD;
poor motherless and fatherless children his lordship&#xD;
had provided for on his estate; and who had been&#xD;
called after his daughter in gratitude for the timely&#xD;
charity which had saved her life. Having emigrated&#xD;
to the United States with the family in whose charge&#xD;
she had been placed, Bill Davis was fortunate enough&#xD;
to find her, while looking among the Irish for&#xD;

railroad hands; and had made her instrumental in&#xD;
securing himself a snug little fortune, as well as in&#xD;
punishing a man whom he discovered at a glance to be&#xD;
a bully and a villain. having secured the girl a&#xD;
good support also, he congratulated himself on&#xD;
having done quite a philanthropic thing. Whether&#xD;
she lived with him or not he did not care, as it was&#xD;
impossible for Elia to divorce her; and the com-&#xD;
plaint would doubtless come from ker. It certainly&#xD;
looked very much as if she would soon have occasion&#xD;
enough to make complaint, although Bill was pro-&#xD;
fuse of his cautions to his lordship to be careful of&#xD;
his conduct.&#xD;
Rough and reckless as Bill Davis was in deport~&#xD;
ment, at heart he had some admirable qualities.&#xD;
His grandfather had been a soldier in the Revolution,&#xD;
a witness of many British cruelties, the memory of&#xD;
which he had transmitted to his descendants. Often&#xD;
had he told the story of the beautiful, but unhappy&#xD;
Miss McCrea, who was murdered by savages in&#xD;
British employ; and of an act he had witnessed at&#xD;
the surrender of Fort Gris~vold. When the British&#xD;
officer asked, "Who commands this fort ?" "[did,&#xD;
but you do now," answered the brave Col. Ledger,&#xD;
delivering up his sword, which was taken and in-&#xD;
stantly run through his body by the brutal officer.&#xD;
He had seen prisoners butchered, and the wounded&#xD;
piled on carts and run dowim a steep hill, to dash&#xD;
their brains out against the trunks of trees. Being&#xD;
one of the number to make up one of these fearful&#xD;
loads, he had escaped death by the breaking of both&#xD;
of his legs.&#xD;

156      THE ROMANCE o~' AN iRISH GIRL;&#xD;
So often had Bill heard these stories when a boy,&#xD;
the spirit of his Revolutionary sire had become so&#xD;
rooted in his breast, that he was not easily impressed&#xD;
with the merits which aristocratic title conferred on&#xD;
its possessor: and when an opportunity offered, as in&#xD;
the present instance, to humble one of those unworthy&#xD;
representativess of greatness," he could hardly re-&#xD;
frain from the indulgence.&#xD;
Notwithstanding Elia's pecuniary losses, he could&#xD;
have borne the whole infliction better than the latter&#xD;
part of it, which was the getting into the papers of&#xD;
the ridiculous hoax to which he had been subjected&#xD;
by the shrewd Yankee. This not only made his&#xD;
mortification public, but gave Marion an intimation&#xD;
to put her on her guard, and probably defeated his&#xD;
expectation of finding her, entirely. Finding, how-&#xD;
ever, that lie could do nothing better than fall back&#xD;
upon his dignity with the people of Whitehall, lie&#xD;
put on more lordly airs than ever; and, though not&#xD;
abusing his wife, supported her separately. He com-&#xD;
plained a good deal of the want appreciation among&#xD;
Americans for l)eople of refinememit, and was stir-&#xD;
prised that the occasional influx of people of rank&#xD;
made so little impression on their society.&#xD;
"What do English gentlemen do, to preserve their&#xD;
daughters from marrying any of these clowns admitted&#xD;
to your society ?" he asked of a Whitehall gentleman.&#xD;
"Oh, they have not much difficulty in that re-&#xD;
spect," was the ans~ver. "Sometimes an English lord's&#xD;
daughter runs off with her father's coachman; but&#xD;
generally, there is not much demand for them among&#xD;
our better class of young men."&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        157&#xD;
&#xD;
Disgusted with the stupidity of Americans, ia~ toto,&#xD;
Elia set out for New York to ilud an attorney who&#xD;
knew enough to procure him a legal separation from&#xD;
his wife.&#xD;
About the same time Gen. Arsdehl arrived at&#xD;
Quebec, ostensibly upon a pleasure excursion; but&#xD;
really hoping to hear something of Marion. lie in-&#xD;
quired about Ehia, and learned lie had been there&#xD;
also that lie had gone to the United States. lie was&#xD;
successful, too, in learning that a young lady named&#xD;
Marion Wallace, answering the description of Marion&#xD;
Cunningham, had been engaged in service in a&#xD;
French merchant's family ; but had lately mysteri-&#xD;
ously disappeared. From what he could gather con-&#xD;
cerning her circumstances-ignorance of labor-&#xD;
reserve about her history, etc., lie felt quite sure lie&#xD;
had narrowly missed finding the object of his solici-&#xD;
tude at once. Naturally enough he connected her&#xD;
disappearance with the advent of Elia ; and resolved&#xD;
to find out the whereabouts of the latter personage.&#xD;
Follo~ving up the clue obtained at Quebec, he suc-&#xD;
ceeded in tracing Ehia to Whitehall, where he was&#xD;
directed by the account of his marriage given in a&#xD;
paper which had been handed to htini in an office&#xD;
where lie had entered with the purpose of adver-&#xD;
tising for his lordship.&#xD;
Delighted with the account of Elia's adventures&#xD;
thus obtained, the 01(1 general hurried on with the&#xD;
purpose of congratulating him and urging his imme-&#xD;
diate return to Ireland. But, on coming to the scene&#xD;
of his lordship's romance, he found only the bride,&#xD;

&#xD;
whoiti lie cautioned to keep a good lookout on her&#xD;
husband.&#xD;
Finding that Elia was doubtless still ignorant of&#xD;
Marion's vicinity, the general returned to Quebec to&#xD;
investigate in ore closely the iufbrination which might&#xD;
lead to her discovery. here he found that pool'&#xD;
Marion must have had many difficulties to contend&#xD;
with: for, as she was determined upon remaining in-&#xD;
cognito, she shared the disgrace and contempt which&#xD;
has been before mentioned as attaching to girls&#xD;
whose manner betrays good breeding, yet who arrive&#xD;
friendless and penniless among strangers. By the in-&#xD;
fluence of Captain Robinson she obtained a place,&#xD;
where, for a long time, she worked only for her&#xD;
board; her knowledge of what a servant's duties&#xD;
were having heretofore been of quite a different&#xD;
character front that required to enable her to fill a&#xD;
servant's place. Tile poverty of her wardrobe con&#xD;
tasted forcibly with her manners and lady-like&#xD;
knowledge; and caused, as it always must, criticizing&#xD;
remarks : and even the friendship of Captain Robin-&#xD;
son was turned rather to her discredit. how hard&#xD;
the rule which deprives tile children of misfortune&#xD;
of all the privileges of life,-even the friendship of&#xD;
the generous and good! Marion met with the same&#xD;
amount of distrust always attending mystery; and&#xD;
in common with others who have the discretion to&#xD;
keep their own affairs to themselves, was supposed&#xD;
to be governed by other motives than the true ones.&#xD;
The dictum of the ~vorld, however, is-" tell every-&#xD;
thing you know about yourself-" and then-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Wilat a fool not to know enough to keep your own&#xD;
secrets."&#xD;
Marion not only had her Own troubles to bear,&#xD;
but, occasionally, her sympathy for others brought&#xD;
her into their troubles also. it was her fortune to&#xD;
have her attention drawn to a case of a peculiarly&#xD;
toncllulg nature. Among tile hundreds of others&#xD;
seeking places, was one delicate, lady-like little crea-&#xD;
ture, whose story met with only derision and con-&#xD;
tempt; but for whom Marion had great sympathy,&#xD;
because she knew that such histories were not iimm-&#xD;
comilloll in Great Britian. The poor child claimed&#xD;
to be a wife, and soon became a mother. 11cr help-&#xD;
less and pitiful situation gamed her no compassion in&#xD;
Quebec, except such as Marion extended to her at&#xD;
the risk of being thought " no better than her."&#xD;
Finding her story discredited entirely, Mariomi ad-&#xD;
vised her to refrain from mentioning her trials to any&#xD;
one, as it appeared that those ~vho accepted their fhte&#xD;
without lnurmnmlrillg, and coIlSOilted to be thought&#xD;
anything of, were more successful in finding friends,&#xD;
or "patrons" at least, than those whose delicacy,&#xD;
shrunk from such suspicionS. Besides, there is a joy&#xD;
even in sorrow, so long as it is yours alone ; and a&#xD;
secret Ilas a stimulus while it belongs only to you,&#xD;
which evaporates the moment it is transferred to an-&#xD;
otlIer. Marion's unllappy young protegee ilad cx-&#xD;
pected a very different reception from the people of&#xD;
Canada-a mistake frequently arising out of the re-&#xD;
presentations given in letters from parties residiimg&#xD;
there to their friends ill the mother country. In-&#xD;
stead of finding help for the needy, or work for the&#xD;

Willifl(r she found contempt and denial on every&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
The lady with whom Marion was living, objected&#xD;
strongly to the part she was enacting in the case of&#xD;
the poor young mother, and "warned her faithfully,"&#xD;
as she said, "against venturing her own character&#xD;
and interests in that way ;" but Marion, with the&#xD;
firmness which had always belonged to her, per-&#xD;
severed in doing what she conceived to be right; and&#xD;
resolved to suffer the consequences. How, indeed,&#xD;
these pious ladies of Quebec expected the young&#xD;
mother and child to live, if all men filled with the&#xD;
same pious horror of sin as then~selves,-or how they&#xD;
expected to clear their skirts of her blood, if they let&#xD;
her die, did not appear in the discussion. Certain it&#xD;
is, they were filled with alarm at the terrible state of&#xD;
morals in Quebec, and resolved not to countenance&#xD;
those shameless women who have no more sense of&#xD;
propriety than to be unfortunate, poor and suffering;&#xD;
and not to keep servants who are engaged in en-&#xD;
couraging such a state of things! These angels of&#xD;
purity, whose innocent hearts surmised evil enough&#xD;
about Marion's poor little charge to have sunk fifty&#xD;
like her in perdition, held female prayer meetings&#xD;
where they might deplore the terrible wickedness of&#xD;
their sex. The most charitable of them prayed&#xD;
fervently to God to feed the hungry and clothe the&#xD;
naked, after having listened to the reports of the&#xD;
Visiting Committee and ascertained that there were&#xD;
a great many of that destitute class in and about&#xD;
their city, whom somebody omtgkt to fced and clothe.&#xD;

most in these meetings, and related to her sympa-&#xD;
thizing listeners the trials she had experienced with&#xD;
her servant, who, she said, she suspected to be a cast&#xD;
off mistress of Captain Robinson, as he had ap-&#xD;
peared to be the only acquaintance she had. The&#xD;
girl, she said, really seemed to have been raised like&#xD;
a lady, and to have been much better educated than&#xD;
many of the Quebec ladies. One of her society&#xD;
suggested that, if she was really a person of educa-&#xD;
tion, she ought to be promoted to some higher&#xD;
service-made a teacher, or something of that sort.&#xD;
Mrs. IMI   "that wo&#xD;
Oh no," said         ,        uld never do at&#xD;
all; because she is a person of a very strong mind,&#xD;

to all of us. Eveim now she defies my advice and&#xD;
authority, and acts the part ot' patron to a person of&#xD;
doubtful reputation whom she has taken a fancy to.&#xD;
No, it would never do; she would always be drag-&#xD;

guilty of any outrage against law or order in Ireland,&#xD;
where she says she came from, and has been drivemi&#xD;
away from home by some mnisfortune which she is&#xD;
too proud to explain, she is still not such a person as&#xD;
one wants to employ. The children soon become&#xD;
attached to her, and more frequently ask her opinion&#xD;

After Lord Charles Elia's appearance in Quebec,&#xD;
and Marion's disappearancee, 'some began to suspect&#xD;
who shine might have been, and these same censorious&#xD;
ladies felt rebuked in their consciences-not on ac-&#xD;
count of humanity in general, but because they had&#xD;
dealt so severely with a person of real consequence,&#xD;
who might sometime be able to return their con-&#xD;
tempt with interest. They sheltered themselves be-&#xD;
hind the fact that she had been so reserved about her&#xD;
circumstances, and preserved a mystery that would&#xD;
naturally engender suspicion. They seemed to for-&#xD;
get tileir treatment of poor Jennie Argyle, who had&#xD;
confessed her situation, and received only scorn and&#xD;
neglect for her confidence; and who died unpitied&#xD;
aftet' Marion was forced to leave her to their tender&#xD;
mercies! Marion's experience with tile world had&#xD;
taught her never to address herself to the cornyassian&#xD;
of her fellow creatures, the only sure result of such a&#xD;
course being over-attention for a time, if you suc-&#xD;
ceed in awakening an interest at all, and neglect&#xD;
afterward; besides the feeling of obligation incurred,&#xD;
Wuliell becomes insupportable irksome, especially&#xD;
after tile reaction Ilas taken place.&#xD;

&#xD;
she, too, had been guilty of the oft-repeated sin of&#xD;
marrying out of her own rank. Torn from lici'&#xD;
husband and sent abroad without means of support,&#xD;
only to be got "out of the way," she had, literally,&#xD;
been murdered by the cruelty of her own ththcr,&#xD;
aided and abetted by the cruelty of society in&#xD;
general. had 11cr husband been able to follow and&#xD;
find her, any time soon enough to have saved her litb,&#xD;
they might have heeti more hap~)y in this country&#xD;

sorted connection. lint no such happy accident of&#xD;
fortune awaited her, doomed to an early and l)itiful&#xD;
death for assuming the prix~ilege of choosing her life-&#xD;
long associate.&#xD;
Upon making this melancholy discovery, and&#xD;
finding 1mev child still in the hands of tile woman&#xD;
who had furnished her lodgings at Marion's expense,&#xD;
the general at 011CC proposed to send both woman&#xD;
and child to Ireland. But this l)roposition brought&#xD;
upon him time Suspicion of being the person who had&#xD;
thus betrayed and deserted the girl ; and those who&#xD;
had done nothing for her while living, now that she&#xD;
was dead, found occasion to be very indignant at her&#xD;
supposed betrayer. The general was therefore forced&#xD;
to exiAain his relationship and the right lie had to&#xD;
adopt her child, and also to defend her fair fume&#xD;
from the blame of having done anything worse than&#xD;
to marry according to her inclinations. He had her&#xD;
remains removed from tile potter's field to a vault,&#xD;
and a proper memorial made of her miatrie and&#xD;

This sad business put an end to all pleasure from&#xD;
the old general's visit. When he had been in&#xD;
Canada before, it was on quite a different errand.&#xD;
Then he thought England's the only government on&#xD;

how soon all America l)ecame a republic. This bar-&#xD;
barous conduct on the part of his own brother, in&#xD;
common with other men of rank in his country,&#xD;
shocked his humanity and disgusted him with the&#xD;
selfishness of aristocracy.&#xD;
In Quebec, the loyal part of the gentry were very&#xD;
much chagrined at the account the papers gave of&#xD;
Elia's subjection to Yankee wit and daring, in his late&#xD;
n'iatri~nonial adventure. The fact of his having&#xD;
Lard before his name was sufficient, in their estima-&#xD;
tion, to entitle him to more respectful treatment. It&#xD;
made them desirous, too, that lie should do some-&#xD;
thing to distinguish himself among those "indepen-&#xD;
dent New Englanders, who turned up their noses at&#xD;
titles." Already, they imagined, their example had&#xD;
disaffected many of the Canadians, and made them&#xD;
insensible to the blessings bestowed by the good&#xD;
queen upon their undeserving heads. They dis-&#xD;
liked exceedingly to be reminded that, during the&#xD;
last war, many ~C~5OIl5 from the States had been&#xD;
aken for treason, carried to England, tried and con-&#xD;
demnued to death-persons, too, who on'ce came&#xD;
from Great Britain, and were forced to seek a living in&#xD;
the United States, or die of want. Now that they had&#xD;
&#xD;
found homes worth fighting for, and plenty to make&#xD;
life endurable, they were seized and taken back to&#xD;
(lie as traitors. The United States had retaliated by&#xD;
imprisoning tiwir subjects and refushvr to deliver&#xD;
them up, except in return for those citizens retaine(l&#xD;
by Great Britain. The consequence of this pI'omlt&#xD;
action was the return of the condemned; and the&#xD;
influence of this COnceSsion upon many of the citi-&#xD;
zens of Canada was disagreeably I)erceptible to the&#xD;
loyalists, to whoni anything that reminded theni&#xD;
of their decreasing consequence was extremely&#xD;
obnoxious.&#xD;
These humane gentlemen interested themselves in&#xD;
endeavoring to hunt from her hiding-place this&#xD;
Marion Cunningham, who had dared to set at naught&#xD;
the authority of the aristocracy. Every Pimnily who&#xD;
had an Irish gil'l of any intelligence in its service&#xD;
was upon the alert to detect any signs of being ill at&#xD;
ease; and each one hoped to be the discoverer of&#xD;
the fugitive's asylum. Whether they would have&#xD;
succeeded or not, had it not beemi for Gen. Arsdell's&#xD;
movements, is not known. The old general , from&#xD;
being known to be her friend, was as closely observed&#xD;
as she would have been, and the direction of his&#xD;
thoughts almost guessed at; however, lie (lid not suc&#xD;
ceed in doing more toward finding Marion, than&#xD;
more effectually to stir up the public curiosity about&#xD;
her.&#xD;
After giving up the search in Canada, the general&#xD;
paid a visit to the States, and especially to the sceime&#xD;
of Gen. Proctor's famous defeat by the little band&#xD;
of Buck-eyes, under Major Croghiam at Lower San-&#xD;

of extermination and scalping to the little band in&#xD;
the fom't, was obliged to retire, not only without forc-&#xD;

coinpaiiy had heaven enlisted on its side, against&#xD;
which neither regulars nor Indians could ever pre-&#xD;

the sentiment that all men were born free and equal:&#xD;

In a few days after arriving there she was taken ill olin-&#xD;

she employed, though considered the most skillful in&#xD;
the place, was not a person of unimpeachable habits,&#xD;

took, any real interest in her, or who knew anything&#xD;
of her whereabouts. This person was a Mr. West-&#xD;
a good man, and a Free-mason. He feared from&#xD;
what he saw, that Marion would fall into the hands of&#xD;
Elia before a much longer time had elapsed, unless he&#xD;
could excite for her the friendship of the people of&#xD;
Bytown; and, with this kind intention, he had&#xD;
mentioned the matter in co~ilidence to one of his&#xD;
Masonic brethren, telling him to speak of it in the&#xD;
Lodge, but nowhere else at present; as, until they&#xD;
could be of service to her, it would be better to keep&#xD;
their knowledge entirely secret. Thus, the very in-&#xD;
formationi Dr. Kingsley was longing to obtain, caine&#xD;
into his possession through his membership with the&#xD;
Lodge, who had no thought that he would not use the&#xD;
ordinary discretion required of its members.&#xD;
But, the good doctor could not keep the story from&#xD;
his wife, and she could not keep it from another&#xD;
woman whose husband was a lawyer, and was ex-&#xD;
pected to manage Marion's case for her if it became&#xD;
necessary. This latter lady, Mrs. Lee, had not, as it&#xD;
subsequently appeared, the most perfect confidence&#xD;
in her husband; and, as he, more true to his Masonic&#xD;
pledge, kept his knowledge of Marion a secret, even&#xD;
from his wife, she became jealous of her, and was lay-&#xD;
ing up in her heart all manner of spite against the day&#xD;
when an occasion should offer for showing it. At&#xD;
length, Mr. Lee discovering that his calls upon Marion&#xD;
had already been made the subject of remark, one&#xD;
day asked her to accompany him to see his client,&#xD;
who was still very much out of health. Accordingly,&#xD;
Mrs. Lee went to see her, and found her very feeble&#xD;

and nervous, so much so, she was impelled to express&#xD;
her pity, and her husband hoped she was satisfied.&#xD;
But, whether she saw anything to pity or not, it did&#xD;
not prevent her expressing certain sentiments to Mrs.&#xD;
Kingsley, who reported them to her husband, who, in&#xD;
his turn, mentioned thiemii in terms of great indigna-&#xD;
tion to Marion. This indiscretion on the part of the&#xD;
doctor, pi'oduced still further indiscretion on the part&#xD;
of Marion, who, ill and excitable, could not control&#xD;
herself as well as formerly, and expressed her con-&#xD;
tempt for and independence of Mrs. Lee's opinions;&#xD;
not fearing, however, that her physician would repeat&#xD;
whatever she might say, under such provocation.&#xD;
But, as usual, the doctor told his wife, and his wife&#xD;
went straight to Mr&amp;amp; Lee with it; and the Ioor jea-&#xD;
lous, spiteful woman needed no greater cause to wage&#xD;
a deadly war on the offender. The gossips, of whom&#xD;
there is always a majority in a provincial town, were&#xD;
set to work, uttering all sorts of c&amp;amp;njectures about,&#xD;
and insinuations against the stranger, who caine&#xD;
amongst them under circumstances so extraordinary;&#xD;
while, in the meantime, Marion found the Kingsleys&#xD;
amongst her worst because her most indiscreet slan-&#xD;
derers. Mrs. Kingsley had been a very ambitious&#xD;
woman once, whose Pride had been humbled by the&#xD;
career of the doctor, whose dissipation had caused his&#xD;
expulsion from the church of which she was a mem-&#xD;
ber. She had suffered herself, from the scandal of the&#xD;

whose first wife died suddenly, and, as it was hinted,&#xD;
under circumstances of gre at mystery. The gossips&#xD;

Thus for some time her course had been anything but&#xD;
a pleasant one. To cap the climax of her annoyances,&#xD;
her husband xvas dismissed from the church for mis-&#xD;
demeanors of an undeniable character. Ever since&#xD;
this event she seemed to evince a feverish desire to find&#xD;
faults of equal magnitude hi others, in order to dhnin-&#xD;
ish the comparative greatness of the doctor's offences.&#xD;
~or did the doctor himself seem altogether above&#xD;
the same weakness, of fishingg to bring People down&#xD;
to his own level, as he was sure to report to h~r all&#xD;
he heard, and repeat to her all lie surmised. Into&#xD;
such hands ~Iarion found herself committed&#xD;
By this time her story, or such parts of it as were&#xD;
known to any one, was pretty freely circulated among&#xD;
the people of Bytown. The expressions of opinion&#xD;
were various; but all agreed that, if she had pro-&#xD;
perty in her own right, she ought to try to gt~t pos-&#xD;

to wait for this windfall that was to be. Constantly&#xD;
lie expressed to Marion the deep interest he took in&#xD;
her affimirs, and the burden it was upon his mind.&#xD;
Finding that her prudence had saved up a little&#xD;
money against a time of need, he represented to her&#xD;
the embarrassed condition of his affairs, and the&#xD;
straits to which he was reduced in his family expemi-&#xD;
ditures, until she was impelled to relieve him by&#xD;
paying him what ought to have been a satisfactory&#xD;

intci'cst, the iiicoiue front which ~vas to continue for&#xD;
an indefinite length of tinie, or as long as lie was&#xD;
the same needy individual.&#xD;
Much as Marion felt annoyed by these traits among&#xD;
the people with whom she had taken refuge, she was&#xD;
compelled to endure them with a good grace, as long&#xD;
as fears of falling in with Ehia made almost any state&#xD;
of things endurable.&#xD;
In her weak and nervous state, being subject to&#xD;
perpetual apprehension, and subject at the same time,&#xD;

secret machinations, before claiming openly his vic-&#xD;
tim.&#xD;
Letters were written to men of depraved character&#xD;
in I3ytown, purporting to come from Miss Cunning-&#xD;
ham, and having the effect to set a crowd of wink-&#xD;
ing, grinning and squinting scoun(lrels to watch her&#xD;
windows and put themselves in her way whenever it&#xD;
was 1)OSSiblC. The letters were handed about, and&#xD;
scandal became public. Chambermaids and porters&#xD;
treated her with contempt, and the landlord refused&#xD;
to board her. In this state of affairs, Mr. Lee&#xD;
having gone from home, his wife, either moved by&#xD;
interest or colfll)aSsion, went to a Mr. Brown, another&#xD;
attorney, and asked him to protect Miss Cunning-&#xD;
ham until Mr. Lee's return. rfhis gentleman called&#xD;
on Marion, and gave her assurances of protection&#xD;
only in case she would place her business in his&#xD;
hands. This of course she refused to do, as she had&#xD;
already employed Mr. Lee, and thought the course&#xD;
proposed by Mr. Brown contemptible. While affairs&#xD;
were in this condition, one man took upon himself&#xD;
the task of sifting the matter and finding from what&#xD;
source those several letters really came. Marion was&#xD;
at the same time imploring the church people to do&#xD;
something to save her from the fate which stared her&#xD;
in the face-that of being abandoned entirely to the&#xD;
lawless passions and vulgar prej udices of an uncul-&#xD;
tivated people. But not one of these "people of&#xD;
God " dared risk their purity in this matter, and sanc-&#xD;
timoniously held aloof from one poor, hunted and&#xD;
helpless woman, as if she had had the power to&#xD;
inoculate the whole church with evil. Expecting&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
the very worst, Marion had armed herself ibm' (lelelice,&#xD;
when t~vo events happened of great interest to hei'.&#xD;
First, the gentleman who had undertaken to investi-&#xD;
gate the matter, succeeded in ~)roving that the letters&#xD;
all emanated from one source-Mrs. Kingsley.&#xD;
What her secret motive was, di(l not appear, nor was&#xD;
the truth made known, as it ought to have been,&#xD;
because it was thought Mrs. Kingsley was of more&#xD;
consequence than Miss Cunningham; and it was not&#xD;
believed that the doctor was a party to time infa-&#xD;
mous action. Indeed, it was said that Mrs. Kingsley&#xD;
~vent into hysterics whenever the doctor undertook&#xD;
to defend Miss Cunningham, so certain was she that&#xD;
the girl was a vile impostor.&#xD;
The second event, which caine immediately upon&#xD;
the heels of the first, was time appearance in Bytown&#xD;
of a gentle man and two ladies, who, becoming&#xD;
informed of the presence of such a person as Miss&#xD;
Cunningham, expressed the greatest astonishment at&#xD;
finding her at large. In a few days more, another&#xD;
party caine on, who entered a criminal complaint&#xD;
against her, and had her arrested. Marion was now&#xD;
completely in the toils of her enemies. A form of&#xD;
trial was gone through, and a true bill found against&#xD;
her for having committed infanticide to hide her&#xD;
shame from the people of Ireland!&#xD;
She was then placed in a sheriff's hands to be taken&#xD;
to Quebec, her ignorance of legal forms of defence&#xD;
making her an easy prey to the cunning of her ac-&#xD;
cusers. Arrived at Quebec, quite a numnher of per-&#xD;
sons were, apparently, informed of her return-Lord&#xD;

descended to express his sympathy with her condition,&#xD;
and expressed his regret that he had not been able to&#xD;
offer her his protection. "It pained him deeply," he&#xD;
said "to find her spiritual condition such-since as&#xD;
his god-child he could not refrain from taking the&#xD;
greatest interest in her. lie was happy to say he was&#xD;
(~omln1ssIone(l by her mother to bring her home&#xD;
if she could be found; and, although lie did not ex-&#xD;
pect to find her accused of such a crime, he was&#xD;
still very willing to become her guardian upon the&#xD;
voyage."&#xD;
Besides Lord Elia7s condescension, Marion received&#xD;
advice from several of her former friends and em-&#xD;
I)l~ers in Quebec "to repent of her sins, and cast her&#xD;
burdens upon Christ; for, though she might be viler&#xD;
than the vilest, lIe was able to save her." Marion,&#xD;
rather irritated by this useless and hollow sympathy,&#xD;
answered that, "for their sake, she was glad even&#xD;
hypocrites might repent and be forgiven ;" for which&#xD;
indiscretion of her tongue the officer who had her in&#xD;
charge savagely boxed her ears. Poor Marion! she&#xD;
felt that to die and go to her father, was the only&#xD;
~vish of her heartbroken as it was by so many suf-&#xD;
ferings. All the broken-heart stories she had ever&#xD;
heard, failed to find a parallel in her case; for, not-.&#xD;
withstanding its crushed condition, it seemed to grow&#xD;
b&#xD;
stronger the more it endured. The bitterest dreg in&#xD;
her cup, was the thought that her own mother might&#xD;
have instigated these cruelties. If so, she would&#xD;
rather, much rather, go to prison with Woods, falsely&#xD;

was hers both by nature and by habit. She would&#xD;
accel)t any flute in contentment, that left her at liberty,&#xD;
and restored her to the only l)em'somu in whose love she&#xD;
felt pcm'fect confidence. Thus subniittin g herself to&#xD;
her inevitable destiny for the present, Marion con-&#xD;

very critical indeed~ and fears were entertained that&#xD;
she mightn't live to reach home. As Marion had no&#xD;
servant, though she so much needed one, and it was&#xD;
known she was a prisoner, one kind-hearted American&#xD;
lady sent a black girl to take care of her. This Elia&#xD;
would have objected to; but, seeing no very good&#xD;
reason, and thinking Marion might not make a con-&#xD;
fidant of a negro, lie permitted it. From sonic report&#xD;
of the servant Mrs. hall was sufficiently interested to&#xD;
wish to see the pl'isohmer herself, to which her keeper&#xD;
objected. This circumstance, added to what she had&#xD;
learned of the girl, am'oused Mrs. hall's suspicions that&#xD;
all was not right, and she imparted her convictions to&#xD;
l;ei' husband. Mr. IThil was rather a shrewd maii, and&#xD;

he advised her to be very cautious about expressing&#xD;
such an opinion to others as she had to him ; as, in&#xD;
case she was right, any unwise interference might do&#xD;
more injury than good. Accordingly, Mrs. Hall with-&#xD;
drew her attentions, other than she thought necessary&#xD;
to the invalid's comfort, and these she never failed to&#xD;
extend only through lici' servant. Meanwhile, Mr.&#xD;
hall cultivated the acquaintance of Elia, and arrived&#xD;
at his own conclusions.&#xD;
One day the negress asked Marion if she would not&#xD;
like to be furnished with writing materials. This hint&#xD;
was sufficient for Marion, who eagerly accepted the&#xD;
offer: and wrote little by little, as she was able, tIme&#xD;

little boxes, by looking in which alternately, any&#xD;
desired object could be seen, the new recreation met&#xD;
with great applause on board ship. Several volun-&#xD;
teered to be time first to look for familiar objects in the&#xD;
magical boxes ; and, at length Elia, upon whose curi-&#xD;
osity Mr. hall had been silly operating, proposed to&#xD;
have his father's resi(lenee shown to him, though he&#xD;
confessed that he had no great love for magic, and&#xD;

prise, Allen charged his subject not to forget what he&#xD;
had seen, and assured him lie was now absolved from&#xD;
the spell. The captain then inquired into the cause&#xD;
of his agitation and found that Ehia had not only&#xD;
seen his father's residence in every particular cor-&#xD;
rectly, but had witnessed a very affecting scene where&#xD;
his mother was lying at the point of death, and had&#xD;
even heard the prayer she breathed for him. It was&#xD;
this that had plunged him in grief-a grief he could&#xD;
not altogether dispel when the enchantment had&#xD;
been removed; for, bad as Elia was, he had an Irish-&#xD;
man's love for his family, and there were few more&#xD;
lovable women in Ireland than Lady Elia.&#xD;
Among the other passengers was the noted Ge-&#xD;
neral Lambert, who had become quite intimate with&#xD;
Elia and his party. The general was very much-&#xD;
amused at the report given of E1ia~s experience, and&#xD;
expressed his want of' faith in such impressions. Still&#xD;

&#xD;
the account excited his curiosity, and after some&#xD;
ur~ino' on the nart of Elia he presented himself as a&#xD;
candidate for admission into the charnied influence of&#xD;
the boxes. Allen directed him how long to look&#xD;
steadily that he must give his whole mind up to it, it'&#xD;
he wished to ret a clear view. Ilavino' 'iscert'uned&#xD;
that the general wished to be shown about London,&#xD;
Allen first caused to appear the Queen's procession,&#xD;
leaving l3uckinghanm Palace. here were chaniber-&#xD;
Thins, tin mnpeters, 1)01 icem en, yeomen gmi ards an(l&#xD;
lords-in-waiting; some in black, and some in re(l&#xD;
some (histingilished by their stockings and others by&#xD;
their breeches. Some wear epaulets, an(l some&#xD;
5w0r(ls ; and some have crimson tunics and round&#xD;
velvet hats. They rush this way an(l that, and now&#xD;
a troop of liorseo'uards enter, full armed ~vitJi shin-&#xD;
inn' coats 'nid o'lit tlcriwr swords. Tlirono-h this mass&#xD;
lie saw distinctly 11cr Majesty and Prince Albert,&#xD;
with all the host that follow in the train.&#xD;
After this lie saw Ilyde Park, that Paradise of&#xD;
Englishmen, with its massive arches and imposing&#xD;
statuary, and gardens with trees extending out of&#xD;
sight. Then came London tower, the Gallery of the&#xD;
Royal Academy, XTem.non Gallery and the Royal&#xD;
mint. Next St. Thomas' Tower, the Traitor's Gate,&#xD;
and the Bloody Tower where the children of&#xD;
Edward ~T* were inur4red. lie saw a regiment on&#xD;
drill, to the west of this last tower, and going on to the&#xD;
left, saw the council diamber, where those engaged&#xD;
in the Gunpowder Plot were examined. From there&#xD;
he passed to Devereux Tower, where Queen Eliza-&#xD;
beth shook the dying countess, for her treachery,&#xD;

screaming-" God may forgive you but I never can."&#xD;
Tie also got glimpses of Wellington and Nelson in&#xD;
the streets. Altogether, lie had a most ~xtraordb&#xD;
nary visit to London, which he was adjured not to&#xD;
forget.&#xD;
The general's account of what he saw in the boxes&#xD;
excited great interest in the company, particularly as&#xD;
it was noticed lie rather kept in Allen's society after&#xD;
this occasion, and took frequent opportunities of&#xD;
looking in the magic glass. This had the desired&#xD;
effect. The captain became curious i~nd wanted&#xD;
to see something in this way. Greenwich Park was&#xD;
shown to him by request. lIe was transported to a&#xD;
spot where lie could look up and down the Thames,&#xD;
and cast his eye over the most wonderful collection&#xD;
of shipping in the world. After satisfying the cap-&#xD;
tain's curiosity about familiar places, lie looked him&#xD;
steadily in the eye for several minutes, to make him&#xD;
recollect it, as lie explained. General Lambert then&#xD;
called for Waterloo. To this Allen objected, unless&#xD;
the general would look for it in his eye, instead of in&#xD;
the box, and to this the general agreed. It was&#xD;
rather an awkward position for the resolute 01(1 gen-&#xD;
eral, whose eye had never quailed before man or&#xD;
beast; but it was not long before the lids drooped&#xD;
over those blazing orbs, whose fire had so often dri-&#xD;
ven terror to the faltering soldier's heart; and hi~&#xD;
mighty will and superior judgment were in the con-&#xD;
trol of another. He was a willing captive, too, as he&#xD;
saw drawn up in battle array, the million and a half&#xD;
of men whose presence signalized the occasion when&#xD;
that mighty spirit which had shaken the thrones of&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Europe to their foundations, was himself overcome,&#xD;
and England achieved imlnortal glory. But strange&#xD;
to say, lie found himself sympathizing far niore with&#xD;
Napoleon than ever lie had before, and the exultation&#xD;
of England appeared uncalled for.&#xD;
After this very satisfactory exhibition of his magi-&#xD;
cal po~~~ei', Allen excused himself for that day, pi'o-&#xD;
Inisiug further exhibitions at some future tiiiie ; and&#xD;
General Lambert returned to the society of the ladies&#xD;
of Elia's party with whom lie had previously been&#xD;
conversing. As he approached this group lie fixed&#xD;
his eyes on Lady Burton, a daughter of Bishop l're-&#xD;
donia's, who had found occasion to follow Elia to&#xD;
Canada, and was astonished to pei'Ceive a iiauie writ-&#xD;
ten in her forehead, of peculiar significance. Lu-&#xD;
pelled by the strongest wonder, lie approached still&#xD;
nearer, an(h in('re~1~ I his scrutiny, in ~o marked a&#xD;
inaniier as to attuaci the attention of her husband,&#xD;
who rather angrily inquired the reason of his impei'-&#xD;
tinent observation. The general, feeling coIiil)elled&#xD;
to explain, told Sir Jaities Burton what lie had been&#xD;
surprised to remark concerning his lady. his lord-&#xD;
ship was offended-angry words followed, and the&#xD;
general was challenged.&#xD;
The captain being infornied of the quarrel, reached&#xD;
the spot too late to adjust the difficulty. While lie&#xD;
stood looking at Lady Burton, lie was confounded at&#xD;
making the same discovery which Gen. Lambert load&#xD;
made, of a name on her ladyship's forehead. Turn-&#xD;
ing a wondering look on Ehia, lie saw the head of a&#xD;
serpent where Elia's belonged, and heard a hissing&#xD;
noise issue from his mouth. horror-struck, the cap-&#xD;

tam started back with an exclamation, which, being&#xD;
interl)rctc(l as an insult, a scene of contusion immedi-&#xD;
ately l)egan. The l)arties demanded satisfaction&#xD;
and called 111)011 the ofl~mmders to fight. The captain,&#xD;
however, utterly refused, after lirst trying to explain&#xD;
what it was inI1)ossible he should explain. In answer&#xD;
to their furious demands, lie replied that he was&#xD;
master of time ship and all on board, and would have&#xD;
no fighting." As for Elimi, he was very quiet, and (lid&#xD;
iiot insist upon the fighting so much as Sir James,&#xD;
who made a great ellort to produce a mutiny among&#xD;
the passengerss , but without niu~h effect. Both the&#xD;
general and captain were too much respected to&#xD;
meet with that sort of treatment ; and the captain at&#xD;
last, finding tile spirit of discord too strong for good&#xD;
order, had the turbulent spirits arrested and put in&#xD;
confinement during' tile remainder of the ~&#xD;
Toyage.&#xD;
While all this was going on, Allen was kept in his&#xD;
I'OOlIl by a feigned indisposition, and avoided being&#xD;
called upon, either to explain the cause of tile trouble,&#xD;
or to take any l)al't in the a(lJnstnlent of it. After&#xD;
quiet was restored, the general and captain, the un-&#xD;
preuleditating 'mo'itators of the trouble, kept much&#xD;
'0&#xD;
too'ethem' talkino' over these singular incidents, and&#xD;
0            0&#xD;
other remarkable experiences of their lifetime. These&#xD;
conversations were often prolonged until far into the&#xD;
night. One night, shortly after the affair just&#xD;
mentioned, two o'eiitl emen were conversing on (leek,&#xD;

&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        183&#xD;
observed the cloud descending upon the water, and&#xD;
approaching the vessel.&#xD;
"What now ?" c~jaculated the captain, who was&#xD;
constitutionally rather a nervous man, and whose&#xD;
superstitious tell(leneies had bceii aroused by tl)e late&#xD;
singular events on l)oard ship.&#xD;
"It looks to inc like a boat, with one black and&#xD;
one wiute sail, and having three persons on board&#xD;
answered Laml)ert.&#xD;
"A queer craft to be coming down on us at this&#xD;
time and place," remarked the captain, uneasily.&#xD;
On and on came the mysterious boat, faster than&#xD;
wind or oar could possil)le have impelled it, and, un-&#xD;
heeding the motion of the ship, run straight under the&#xD;
side. In a moment more her crew were on the deck,&#xD;
beside tIme startled watchers.&#xD;
"Who are you ?" demanded the captain in a voice&#xD;
hoarse with fear.&#xD;
" Avengers of the innocent !'.' thundered the fore-&#xD;
umost of the ghostly three. " On board your ship you&#xD;
carry as a prisoner, Marion Wallace Cunnincrhan&#xD;
b&#xD;

truction. Release her from her captivity, restore her&#xD;
the price of her passage, and give her your protection&#xD;
on pain of shipwreck in case of refusal or neglect !"&#xD;
" Stay, tell us who you are," cried Lambert, sum-&#xD;
moning up all his courage for the effort.&#xD;
" Wallace, Bruce and Douglas, her father's coun-&#xD;
trymnen, and champidus of liberty !" was the solemn-&#xD;
toned answer proceeding from the second ghost, who&#xD;
the general now perceived, bore a strong resemblance&#xD;
to the Bruce l)ortraits.&#xD;

"Do you promise ?" asked the stern-v isaged Doug~&#xD;
las of the captain.&#xD;
"I do," answered the captain, quaking in every&#xD;
limb.&#xD;
"At this answer, the three plumed chieftains again&#xD;
vanished over the ship's side, and, as their boat danced&#xD;
out upon the waves, the mingled chorus of their voices&#xD;
reached the ears of those on deck, chanting "Liberty&#xD;
and l)rotection to the innocent, or shipwreck and&#xD;
death to the guilty."&#xD;
The next morning Marion was taken to breakfast&#xD;
in the cabin and treated with all kindness and respect,&#xD;
though, as yet, she was uninformed of the agency&#xD;
which had been used to procure her freedom. Indeed,&#xD;
the real agent iii the matter was so ill from over-&#xD;
exertion that he could not appear at the table for a&#xD;
day or two: and the captain gave him every atten-&#xD;
tion in his power, little suspecting that he had been&#xD;
victi inized by this powerful numb as lie had&#xD;
been.&#xD;
Marion's American friends treated her with a quiet&#xD;
kindness which she could not help feeling, and,&#xD;
although they said little to her, she was quite sure&#xD;
she o~ved her liberty to tl~em. The black girl could&#xD;
tell her nothing to enlighten her much. At length&#xD;
she made bold to ask Mrs. Hall to relate to her the&#xD;
particulars of what had occurred. This, Mrs. hall&#xD;
consented to, upon a promise of secrecy, and great&#xD;
was Marion's astonishment as well as delight at the&#xD;
recital. She thanked her friends warmly, regretting&#xD;
that she could then make no other acknowledgment.&#xD;

MARION had resolved, now that she was in Ireland,&#xD;
she woul(l niake an attempt to see or communicate&#xD;
wit Ii John Woods before returning to Ai~~ei'ica, as she&#xD;
exl)ected to do. Mr. B. F. Allen, whose love of'&#xD;
adventure may be ~uessed from the history of the&#xD;
voyage, thought it best, although the Ehia party were&#xD;
not to be released from confinement before reaching&#xD;
Liverpool, to keep in Miss Cunnino~ha nm's company&#xD;
while she remained in Ireland, a country he very&#xD;
much wished to see. By so doing, lie might be of&#xD;
service to her and find some amusement for himself,&#xD;
in acting the pait of her esquire; an arrangement&#xD;
which Marion had reason to be grateful for. Before&#xD;
leaving the ship, Marion had received from time cap-&#xD;
tain, beside her ~ mon ey, a present from Gen.&#xD;
J4ambert and her American friends, of funds sufficient&#xD;
to defray her probable expenses. Thus furnished,&#xD;
she stepped upon Irish soil once more, with a greater&#xD;
feeling of pleasure than she anticipated when she set&#xD;
sail from Quebec.&#xD;
Mr. Allen was delighted with the beautiful harbor&#xD;
of Cork, aimd somewhat surprised af the elegance and&#xD;
seeming prosperity of the city. ITo had not yet&#xD;
learned how to reconcile the splendor of some classes,&#xD;
with the squalid poverty of others; and, as lie looked&#xD;
upon time solid-looking squares of magnificent build-&#xD;
ings, so firm and so substantial in their beauty, lie&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
cOUl(i not litli) asking' if this was the country that&#xD;
sent such starved and destitute hordes to the shores of&#xD;
the United States, year after year.&#xD;
Their arrival happening upon Saturd :iy ni gut, the&#xD;
noise of business had pretty much subsided. The&#xD;
forcethe          Allen iioticed hid in his&#xD;
first tluiig&#xD;

eyes, a singularly warlike appearance P)r a tune of&#xD;
peace. Their un iforin was dark greeu, of a military&#xD;
cut-a regimental Cal)- broad black belt c~irtouch&#xD;
box, short musket and bayonet. rfhe chiefs wore&#xD;
swords and their companies seemed very numerous.&#xD;
As might be hoped, under so heavy a guard, the city&#xD;
was very quiet (lurino' the nio'ht.&#xD;
iBut Sunday morning-gracious heavens, what a&#xD;

Allen's credulity was taxed to its utmost, to bc-&#xD;
lieve in what lie saw, and iMlarioii's amusement at&#xD;
his horror of vermin-hunting, was, to him, entirely&#xD;
inconsistent with womanly delicacy.&#xD;
Marion had been a witness to a little scene between&#xD;
Allen and a maid about the house, which had first&#xD;
excited her mirthfulness, and caused her to be so&#xD;
much aihused by him. Allen was standing by a&#xD;
window, watching a crowd of these people, without&#xD;
comprehending their business, when, turning to this&#xD;
girl, lie asked, "Why do these people make that jerk-&#xD;

answered Biddy, tossing her head with an air. "Och,&#xD;
good luck to you," continued Biddy, "there's one&#xD;
on your coat; and he doesn't act like a stranger,&#xD;
either I"&#xD;
" Oh, for God's sake, take it off!" cried Allen,&#xD;
fairly dancing with horror. Tile girl laughingly corn-&#xD;
1)lied, an(l Allen, seized with a sudden frar about his&#xD;
bed, ~vent to examine it. To all appearance, it was&#xD;
clean; but, upon investigation of a closer sort, quite&#xD;
a coin pany of vermin were discoVered to have&#xD;
retired to spend the Sabbath in quiet, preparatory to&#xD;
making an assault on him the following night. Allen&#xD;
judged by the general quiet upon the subject, tlmat it&#xD;
annoyed nobody else as it did him, and heroically&#xD;
resolved to make tIme best of it while he remained.&#xD;
how long a time this would be, he had not settled&#xD;
in his own mind, as he expected first to hear from&#xD;
some friends, who were to JOiD in an excursion over&#xD;
the island. lie half yielded to the temptation to&#xD;
warn them against the projected tour, when it oc~&#xD;
cured to him that Cork had always borne rather a bad&#xD;
name, even in Ireland, and this might be the worst&#xD;
of his experience. When appealing to Mariomi for&#xD;
advice, he received but little satisfaction. She told&#xD;
him that the south of Ireland was more settled with&#xD;
English, than the north; and the English claimed&#xD;
superiority over the Irish, who were supposed to be&#xD;
benefited by their residence among them. "God&#xD;
pity the recipients of such whole-souled benevo-&#xD;
lence !" exehaimed Allen; "if what we see here is&#xD;
the product of it."&#xD;
Wishing to escape from his hotel and its associa-&#xD;
&#xD;
tion of ideas, Allen proposed to Marion to walk about&#xD;
the city, and see its sights. They had Dot gone far&#xD;
when they met the people returning from mass ; who,&#xD;
as soon as they caine upon the street, rushed for the&#xD;
liquor Shops, either to driilk or pi'ocure a SUPI)ly ot the&#xD;
good Creature." Every tourth person they met,&#xD;
carried a bottle or juo; and the language they heard&#xD;
corresl)onded with the other appearances. It was as&#xD;
if a thousand houses of correction had turned their&#xD;
inmates into the streets. \l~Tomen and ~irls exceeded&#xD;
b&#xD;
the men in vulgarity and obscenity.&#xD;
so~lts cm&#xD;
how can such shocking L         d sounds be&#xD;
tolerated, in a city like this ?" Allen asked, in amaze-&#xD;
merit. lIe was surl)rised that ladies couki walk the&#xD;
streets, and be forced to witness the shameless eXl)o-&#xD;
sures of person, and listen to the laI)guage l)andied&#xD;
about amongst these crowds. lie blushed to think he&#xD;
had brought Marion out to be so annoyed. But&#xD;
Marion had seen these things many times before&#xD;
and, thouo'lm in contrast to the o'reater reserve in Ca-&#xD;
nada, she felt the impropriety more sensibly than ever&#xD;
before, it was not an mifamihiar scene, and she con-&#xD;
fessed to Allen that it was a Common view in Ireland.&#xD;
Fortunately for Allen's modesty, they found them-&#xD;
selves in the vicinity of an old churchyard, ill which&#xD;
they saw l)eISOns walking. Entering here, they were&#xD;
under the shadow of an 01(1 church, ~vhose walls, half&#xD;

an hour. Their appearance had already caused them&#xD;
to be recognized as strangers, ~vheu a gentleman, in-&#xD;
troducing himself as Mr. Winslowe, ventured to&#xD;
make some inquiries, and was informed that Mr.&#xD;
Allen was a citizen of the United States, travelling&#xD;
for the first time in Ireland-a confession which&#xD;
caused an immediate and cordial invitation to dinner&#xD;
for himself and lady. Allen was then obliged to in-&#xD;
troduce Miss Wallace-as it was previously arranged&#xD;
she should be called-while, to avoid curiosity, lie&#xD;
represented her as a step-sister. The party then went&#xD;
homime to the kindly proffered dinner. Most travellers&#xD;
would have treated the invitatioii as a mere compli-&#xD;
ment, but Allen remembered the condition of his&#xD;
hotel, aimd resolved not to neglect the opportunity of&#xD;
eating in a private house. Besides, lie was sight-see-&#xD;
ing, and the inside of a citizen's residence was a part&#xD;
of what lie wanted to become acquainted with.&#xD;
The dinner-table in Mr. Winslowe's house rather&#xD;
astonished the young republican. had the occasion&#xD;
been one of sonic fashionable club supper, there could&#xD;
not have been a greater profusion or variety of&#xD;
liquors; and Allen was imielined to think lie had&#xD;
fallen among riotous livers. No sooner were they&#xD;
seated at table than the host filled a bumper and&#xD;
drank "Good feeling toward their several nations,"&#xD;
then passed the liquor to his guests. Allen took cold&#xD;
water, responding however in very good taste. his&#xD;
refusal to drink liquors caused, at first, a little fiut-&#xD;
terin~ and wonder about the table, but lie was&#xD;
allowed to have his way. It was not the fashion&#xD;
among the Protestants to refuse liquor, asnone but&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Father Matthews' converts ever ~thought of doing so,&#xD;
and FatI icr M'itthie~vs was exceeding1 y liill)ol)lilar ex-&#xD;

be thought drunkards than known to have any fel-&#xD;
lowship with him.&#xD;
Temperance and i'd igion were shi gliti v discussed,&#xD;
awl Mr. XXTinslowe inquired of Allen if lie was a&#xD;
Christiiin ; to which Allen replied that lie was not.&#xD;
Marion, who understood nutch better than lie did&#xD;
what was meant by the (1UeStiOii, avoided making any&#xD;
remarks, and allowed it to pass, as it was thought to&#xD;
be meant.&#xD;
Mr. Winslowe was not neglectful of' religious cere-&#xD;
mnony, uttering a " praiSe God for his kindness !" at&#xD;
every breath, and growing niore devotional the more&#xD;
wine he drank, as did all the company. Allemi could&#xD;
hardly refrain from thanking God audibly that his&#xD;
country was saved from such a mother as this. She&#xD;
had been weaned none too early for her own welfare.&#xD;
During the last few hours lie had witnessed scenes&#xD;
not only insulting to God but disgusting to hiunmanity.&#xD;
Several hours were spent at table, and when they&#xD;
arose, Allen felt relieved that his l)lain, republican&#xD;
training had spared him the necessity for formuino'&#xD;
b&#xD;
such habits as those practiced in Mr. Winslowe 's&#xD;
really elegant house. If it was by such alniost beastly&#xD;
indulgences that the English attained their boasted&#xD;
elevation of manuel's and sentiments, lie prayed&#xD;
always to remain in his pm'eseiit "low and unrefined&#xD;

superior to that of the United States, and preferable&#xD;

"You will observe," said Mr. Winslowe, "the per-&#xD;

arises from the fact that our servants are born to their&#xD;

class of persons aspire to something above service,&#xD;
and our nobles would have to wait upon themselves&#xD;
very often, after the manner of you Americans.&#xD;
Neither is a nation ever really great without a&#xD;
nobility. You cousins of ours over the water will&#xD;
find that out some day."&#xD;
"We latve a nobility of our own," answered Allen,&#xD;
with inconsiderate pride. When Mr. Winslowe&#xD;
wished him to explain, he was silent from embarrass-&#xD;
ment. Had lie been in a company of Americal~s, lie&#xD;
would gladly have expressed his nicaning; but, hav-&#xD;
ing to represent his country alone, and feeling that&#xD;
he was but a young and inexperienced representa-&#xD;
tive, he wished lie could have withdraxvn his remark.&#xD;
Mr. Winslowe continued:&#xD;
"The English made your great men-Franklin,&#xD;
and Washington, and the rest."&#xD;
"That I suspect is true," answered Allen, some-&#xD;
what aroused by this assertion. "You gave them a&#xD;
fine opportunity of proving what they could do, as&#xD;
well as suffer. Many American ladies, too, who&#xD;
&#xD;
WolII(l have tainted at sight of a surgical operation,&#xD;
you have niade bravo enough to handle the musket."&#xD;
Finding that the others were warm with wine,&#xD;
Allen thought it prudent to (lechine any discussion on&#xD;
the relative nierits of the mother country and her&#xD;
thriving' descendants~ ~         ~        lio4&#xD;
lie bade his A1'J~p1LaIJd.&#xD;
good evening, and returned to his hotel.&#xD;
An unexpectedly quiet sleep (aftcr removing the&#xD;
blankets of his bed) allowed Allen to arise much l'e-&#xD;
freshed the next morning. Inquiring of Marion how&#xD;
she had passe(l the night, lie wasgratihed to find she&#xD;
had been equally fortimate in avoiding a sleepless&#xD;
and restless night. The novelty of Irish manners&#xD;
began to lose their interest, however, and he was just&#xD;
wishing himself in his home among the White Moun-&#xD;
tains, wlieii he was surprised by a call from Mm; Win-&#xD;
slowe, accompanied by several other gentlemen.&#xD;
Taking Allen for a fair exponent of American feel-&#xD;
inn' these visitors wished to discuss some matters&#xD;
which, being referred to in the last iiight's Conversa-&#xD;
tion, they had not thoroughly understood. Among&#xD;
other things, Mr. Winslowe remembered Mr. Allen&#xD;
had said " that there were other men and women in&#xD;
their nation whom the Americans held in as great&#xD;
esteem as they ~did Washington aiid Franklin-time&#xD;
only heroes Englishnien seemed to recognize. Who,&#xD;
then, were those persons so (histiliguJshie(l ~"&#xD;
Allen was considerably nettled by this persistent&#xD;
stupidity, but resolved to meet it as heroically as&#xD;
possible, and answered accordingly: "We call&#xD;

good man, and the man for the circumstances in&#xD;
which he found himself, he proved himself a fathc~'.&#xD;
But a father is not necessarily a greater man than a&#xD;
son or a brother-only relatively with regard to posi-&#xD;
tion, and there are many sons and brothers, and even&#xD;
daughters, who we feel are worthy of their noble&#xD;
sire."&#xD;
"I do not see," said Lord Potter, "what your&#xD;
daughters can have to do with your greatness."&#xD;
"Oh ,yes, Potter!" remarked Lord Blackman,&#xD;
"don't you remember how our men and generals com-&#xD;
plained of their influence in the war of the Revolution?&#xD;
They often remarked they could soon have subdued&#xD;
the rebellion, had it been possible to separate the&#xD;
men from th'e women and children. A shout of&#xD;
encouragement from these would inspire a conquered&#xD;
rebel to renew his resistance, and often made them fight&#xD;
like tigers when they were ready to faint with fatigue.&#xD;
Women even frequently took life, when they could&#xD;
do so by any means in their hands. General Clinton&#xD;
once heard of an old woman, who kept boiling water&#xD;
constantly in readiness, to scald every redcoat who&#xD;
intruded on her premises. One day, his soldiers,&#xD;
being in great suffering from thirst, a party contrived&#xD;
to surprise the woman and keep her prisoner while&#xD;
they procured water. But, a little girl ten years of&#xD;
age, who brought the water for the soldiers to drink,&#xD;
adroitly emptied into it a quantity of poison which&#xD;
had been purchased to kill vermin, and in a short&#xD;
time those who had drunk, were writhing in death '&#xD;
agonies. That was taking an active part in the war,&#xD;
if not a very honorable one. The trick of poisoning&#xD;
&#xD;
water one way and another was very common.&#xD;
Sometimes the dead body of one of our men was&#xD;
boxed up and thrown into a well, there to decom-&#xD;
pose, and give the most horrible diseases to the&#xD;
unlucky wretches who drank the water. Do your&#xD;
people remember these thin 0's Mr.&#xD;
~ , Allen ?"&#xD;
"If they were sometimes tempted to take such&#xD;
revenge for the horrible outrages committed on&#xD;
them," answered Allen, "they have never boasted&#xD;
of it, and it has not beemi recorded in history that I&#xD;
know of. It is more natural, perhaps, that the enemy&#xD;
should remember such occurrences than that we&#xD;
should."&#xD;
The young American was getting tired of the&#xD;
topic, and fearful of a controversy, when a hasty&#xD;
trampling of feet, and a confused noise of cries, oaths&#xD;
and arms, arrested the conversation. In answer to&#xD;
Allen's hasty inquiry, Mr. Winslowe replied-" Oh,&#xD;
it is nothing, only a little fighting." Allen could&#xD;
not help saying it looked to him quite a big fight.&#xD;
"It would not be singular, if there were twice as&#xD;
many engaged in it," was the careless reply of Lord&#xD;
B~ackman. "The United States cannot be very well&#xD;
peopled with Irish, if such scenes are new to you,&#xD;
Mr. Allen."&#xD;
"How do you account for such a state of things&#xD;
here, if I may ask, your lordship ?"&#xD;
"Well, they are a class who live upon estates, and&#xD;
Sunday are their holidays. When they come into&#xD;
the city to drink themselves happy, they sometimes&#xD;
overdo the matter and get into a general fight, which&#xD;
is almost as much of an enjoyment to. theni as the&#xD;

&#xD;
drinking-that being the only means they have of&#xD;
proving either their valor or their enthusiasm. It is&#xD;
a sort of national pastime, in which numbers oniy&#xD;
add to the enjoyment."&#xD;
Allen thought, as lie watched the half-naked crea-&#xD;
tures, with black eyes, broken arms and bruised flesh,&#xD;
mixed up in a general mn~l6e with the police who&#xD;
spared them not, but struck right and left with the&#xD;
butts of their muskets, that it was a strange pastime,&#xD;
and one he should not greatly enjoy, though lie was&#xD;
not a coward.&#xD;
Neither could he get over his astonishment at the&#xD;
freedom with which both sexes exposed their naked&#xD;
persons in the public streets, and lie ventured a&#xD;
remark to that effect, to which Lord Potter replied&#xD;
"that persons of refinement, looked upon this class&#xD;
pretty much as they did upon cattle, and noticed&#xD;
their nakedness as little."&#xD;
Allen could not help the reflection that England&#xD;
had the advantage of comparative immunity from&#xD;
exposure on the subject; since, to represent things&#xD;
as they really are, in some parts of Great Britian,&#xD;
would require a use of language revolting to ears&#xD;
polite, and which would hardly find a publisher.&#xD;
Much talk about national peculiarities was had&#xD;
during the visit, and after an hour or more of this&#xD;
style of conversation, the gentlemen withdrew; all&#xD;
except Lord Potter, who was an Irish Catholic, and&#xD;
had listened rather uneasily to a portion of the re-&#xD;
marks made by the Protestant gentlemen. When lie&#xD;
was alone with Allen, he drew his chair beside him,&#xD;
remarking with considerable feeling:&#xD;
&#xD;
"You, sir, as I heard you say, are not a (ikri8tian.&#xD;
yon~ are then better able to understand our condition,&#xD;
and the great causes of Irish degradation; and all I&#xD;
have to ask of you is, that you will not allow our~ap-&#xD;
parent want of the dignity of humanity to impress&#xD;
you too deeply. I am not a Catholic so much because&#xD;
I find the church of Rome infallible, as because I&#xD;
cannot fellowship the Protestants in the practices they&#xD;
pursue toward our people. As to the real merits of&#xD;
either church, or their ability to take their commu-&#xD;
nicants to heaven, there appears to be but little room&#xD;
for choice, since either is a political institution in&#xD;
Great Britain, and as much corrupted by being so as&#xD;
any might suppose."&#xD;
All this was in a manner unintelligible to Allen,&#xD;
who had never had an opportunity, either to observe&#xD;
or to be informed upon these topics in a very inti~&#xD;
mate sense. He therefore only listened with polite&#xD;
attention, until his lordship had gone through with&#xD;
his subject. Then, feeling some curiosity to learn&#xD;
how much resemblance Marion's history bore to that&#xD;
of others, ,governed by the same social laws, lie intro-&#xD;
duced the subject by inquiring if Lord Potter had&#xD;
known Lord Cunningham when he was alive; to&#xD;
which question his lordship answered,&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"And his family?"&#xD;
Allen then proceeded to relate what had happened&#xD;
to Lord Cunningham's daughter, without mentioning&#xD;
where he learned the story.&#xD;
"It is nothing unusual," said Lord Potter, "for&#xD;

these cases to occur; and it is truly startling to know&#xD;
the means resoi'ted to, to enforce or prevent marriages&#xD;
in Ireland. Sometimes a father has Iti red tla3 c14ar-&#xD;
acter of a daughter impeached, when, by so doing, he&#xD;
could prevent a respectable poor man from taking her&#xD;
for a wife. As for other expedients, their name is&#xD;
legion. Winslowe himself, had a daughter nearly&#xD;
ruined by following the 'course of true love,' which&#xD;
proved no smoother for her thaxi others. Her father&#xD;
was well enough pleased with an advertisement which&#xD;
he met in a town paper, of a gentleman 'thirty-six&#xD;
years of age, of good blood and connections, and with&#xD;
an income of three hundred pounds, who wanted a&#xD;
wife with a comfortable fortune '-to answer it, and&#xD;
propose this daughter for the match. As soon as the&#xD;
young lady heard of it, she went to a friend and&#xD;
beo'o'ed to be taken away. Arrangements were made&#xD;
for the lovers (for she was betrothed to a young&#xD;
merchant in Cork) to meet at Gretna Green, and the&#xD;
very day the marriage settlements were to have been&#xD;
made, she was missing from home, and returned to&#xD;
Cork as the wife of the merchant. Winslowe made a&#xD;
desperate effort to separate them. Love-letters, in-&#xD;
tended to inflame the husband's jealousy, were sent by&#xD;
the post and dropped on the premises; a man paid to&#xD;
lurk about as if by appointment, and all that sort of&#xD;
thing; until the wife, made desperate, watched her&#xD;
opportunity and shot at the hireling who was seeking&#xD;
her ruin. The shot inflicted a fatal injury, and the&#xD;
lady was tried for manslaughter, but discharged.&#xD;
'The law of the fan~iIy'is here the most absolute of&#xD;
all laws. If a child cannot be bent to a parent's pur-&#xD;

pose, it is considered the best policy to break the dis-&#xD;
obedient one, even at the expense of life, which is&#xD;
not uncoinnion."&#xD;
Allen listened to this strange account with interest,&#xD;
but unable really to comprehend or believe it-so&#xD;
much are our opinions formed by custom. lie also&#xD;
took the 9pportunity to tell Lord Potter that there&#xD;
was a man imprisoned in Dublin, he supposed on just&#xD;
such an offence-that of wishing to marry a lady of&#xD;
superior rank; and that for the lady's sake, he would&#xD;
consider it a great privilege to be allowed to speak&#xD;
with him; and asked, if the attempt would be likely&#xD;
to be practicable. Lord Potter replied that as he&#xD;
was not in very high favor with the Protestants, they&#xD;
might refuse such a request from him; but, if it was&#xD;
wished, he would go to Dublin with his young friend&#xD;
cheerfully, and see what could be effected. This&#xD;
generous offer was, of course, accepted, and the mo-&#xD;
muent for setting out was arranged between them at&#xD;
once.&#xD;

THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL:;&#xD;
&#xD;
CIIAPTER XVII.&#xD;
&#xD;
MARION had been a much more appreciative listener&#xD;
to these conversations with the gentlemen of Corki&#xD;
than Allen had been, inasmuch as she understood the&#xD;
public and private sentiments of the people better&#xD;
than he. Some little hesitation was felt about her&#xD;
going to Dublin, as to whether going or remaining&#xD;
was the safest. To cover this hesitation, Allen&#xD;
affected to have some scruples about allowing her to&#xD;
come in contact with the half-dressed savages she&#xD;
must see on such a journey. Lord Potter assured&#xD;
him that his sister would be as safe from insult or ill-&#xD;
treatment asif these poor wretches were fine g'entle-&#xD;
men-gallantry being an Irish quality. A glance&#xD;
from Marion decided Allen to take her along, as her&#xD;
name and the impression that she was an Anierican&#xD;
would probably save her from suspicion, even should&#xD;
Elia be able to get again upon her track. It was&#xD;
not known to him that she was in the American's&#xD;
company. That was a secret from all but her few&#xD;
American friends.&#xD;
Everything being arranged satisfactorily, the&#xD;
travelling party set out in good spirits. Marion was&#xD;
buoyed up by hopes of meeting with her long-lost&#xD;
lover, and Allen had amusement enough in the&#xD;
society of his Irish friend, who proved to have been&#xD;
a fortunate acquaintance. -&#xD;
At Waterford they stopped at a nobleman's seat,&#xD;

'*&#xD;
&#xD;
where Lord Potter introduced his friends from the&#xD;
United States, and procured them a warm reception.&#xD;
As this was the first opportunity that had been&#xD;
afforded Allen of viewing one of these places, except&#xD;
from the road, the visit gave hinm a great deal of&#xD;
pleasure. The spacious lawns and rising grounds&#xD;
afforded beautiful views of the sea-shore and the&#xD;
fishermen, while the delicious verdure which every-&#xD;
where met his eye announced the origin of the name,&#xD;
"Emerald Isle." After the grounds, the buildings&#xD;
were shown to Allen, who declared very emiphatic-&#xD;
ally, in American phrase, it was a "tremendous&#xD;
house."~&#xD;
Whatever else Ireland may lack, it does not want&#xD;
for a disposition to make easy sport of every trifling&#xD;
occasion ; and Allen found real enjoyment among all&#xD;
his chance acquaintances. The journey next day was&#xD;
delightful, and he felt no wish to hasten over a road&#xD;
where there were so many charming places, glebe&#xD;
houses, family mansions, and plantations. Iter-&#xD;
spersed with these more stately residences were little&#xD;
huts, which the American was rash enough to con-&#xD;
clude were smoke-houses, very much to tme amuse-&#xD;
mnent of Marion, though she dared not correct his&#xD;
mistake. Lord Potter, however, explained that they&#xD;
were actually houses for the poor, and Allen's&#xD;
quickened vision began to see little children creeping&#xD;
about their doors, occasionally with a. pig as a play-&#xD;
mate. As an offset to the beauty of the fields and haw-&#xD;
thorn hedges, they beheld crowds of miserable ca-&#xD;
tures working in these fields, the sight of whom made&#xD;
the heart turn sick. These were almost naked and&#xD;

hungry-looking men, and suffering and dispirited&#xD;
women, cursing the children that cannot still the&#xD;
cries of the younger infants. Women, too, with&#xD;
children fastened on their backs, keeping up with the&#xD;
men in their work. Should a mother sit down a few&#xD;
moments to nurse her child, she would immediately&#xD;
engage in picking off vermin, with as much energy&#xD;
and as little shame as she might have blown off a&#xD;
trifle of dust. Marion could not affect as much sur-&#xD;
prise and disgust as Allen exhibited, because it&#xD;
brought to her mind pictures of want and degrada-&#xD;
tion which she had first seen on her father's estate,&#xD;
and the memory of which had never ceased to haunt&#xD;
her. How many plans had she made for bettering&#xD;
their condition, while she herself was in want of the&#xD;
means of ordinary comfortable living. Would the&#xD;
day never come when she could experiment upon&#xD;
this seemingly hopeless material? She did not know.&#xD;
Could she only take the first step toward such an&#xD;
undertaking, in the finding of her imprisoned lover,&#xD;
she might begin to hope the better day had dawned.&#xD;
But her American companion gave frequent utter-&#xD;
ance to his surprise in such exclamations as "Am I&#xD;
in Ireland or Barbary ?"-" Are these freemen or&#xD;
slaves ?"&#xD;
"Do they look like slaves ?" innocently asked&#xD;
Lord Potter.&#xD;
"I do not know, indeed," answered Allen; "be-&#xD;
cause, although we are a slave-holding nation, there&#xD;
are none in our northern States. I only speak of my&#xD;
impression of what a slave must be: a creature with-&#xD;
out pride or shame-the lowest type of humanity."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yet such are not my poor countrymen," said&#xD;
Lord Potter, sadly; "they are forced into their de-&#xD;
graded and repulsive condition, and have enough&#xD;
sensibility left to feel keenly the slights put upon&#xD;
them by strangers as weil as by the English. They&#xD;
Would always wish, poor as they are, to share what-&#xD;
ever they have With any chance friend, and are hurt&#xD;
at being refused. You called them slaves. So they&#xD;
are, to all intents and purposes, but could not be&#xD;
made so by any other than the process used by the&#xD;
English government. Were they suffered to possess&#xD;
their manhood in its native purity, such sights as&#xD;
these Would not now meet your eyes."&#xD;
"Pray tell me," said Allen, "the causes of their&#xD;
extreme poverty."&#xD;
"The causes are various, being the many pGints of&#xD;
a regular system of robbery and oppression, practiced&#xD;
for such a length of time that the people have been&#xD;
formed upon it. I make no doubt were the oppres-&#xD;
sion suddenly removed, the people would still stand&#xD;
in their own light for some years, owhug to the mere&#xD;
force of habit. But, among the most prominent un&#xD;
positions put upon the Irish are the taxes of every&#xD;
description which go to support mass-houses, Pro-&#xD;
testant cathedrals, glebe-houses, and all the parapher-&#xD;
nalia of the two religions. After paying his rents&#xD;
and cuts and supporting his own priest, an Irisimman&#xD;
must p~iy one-tenth of all he raises for the support of&#xD;
the E8tabli8lted Liturek. Were he victimized but by&#xD;
one denomination it would be more tolerable, but he&#xD;
is the slave of both at once. Whether he be Pro-&#xD;
testant or Catholic, he must take part for his faith&#xD;

against the other, oftelb doing things inconsistent with&#xD;
humanity or religion to prove his discipleship. The&#xD;
iRomans are obliged to commit acts at the bidding of&#xD;
their priests which would make the devil blush ;&#xD;
while the Protestants, to retain the confidence of the&#xD;
government, retaliate upon the Romans with deeds&#xD;
of cruelty equal to theirs. Thus, though there is&#xD;
plenty of 'religion' in Ireland, there is very little&#xD;
piety or Christian feeling-at least, none the more on&#xD;
account of the influence of the churches." -&#xD;
The party having paused during this conversation&#xD;
to observe the laborers, two little girls came to the&#xD;
carriage with a bunch of hawthorn blossoms for each&#xD;
of the travellers. The smiles of the children were&#xD;
very sweet and happy, notwithstanding their condi-&#xD;
tion, and as they turned to run away again, Allen,.&#xD;
moved with pity, called them back and gave each a&#xD;
half crown for their politeness. The party then started&#xD;
on ; but had not gone far when they were arrested by&#xD;
the cry of "there they are !-take them, dead or&#xD;
alive !" At this shout, which seemed her death war-&#xD;
rant, or worse ; the warrant of her captivity, Marion&#xD;
fainted for the first time in her life.&#xD;
Here the American's impetuosity served to make&#xD;
the occasion memorable. Springing from the car-&#xD;
riage, revolver in hand, lie met their assailants with&#xD;
a round of shots which served to arrest their pro-.&#xD;
gress. In the melse lie received a ball in his left&#xD;
shoulder, wounding him badly. A hurried " what&#xD;
ill thunder does this mean ?" from Allen, and "God&#xD;
knows-I do not," from Potter, and each party took&#xD;
time to look at his antagonist, when an explanation&#xD;

took place. The attacking party were in pursuit of&#xD;
a runaway couple, and seeing Allen's carriage and&#xD;
inmates, having an air not quite common, inmmedi&#xD;
ately. jumped to the conclusion that they were thme&#xD;
fugitives. Allen on his part had good reason to&#xD;
apprehend that ke really was pursued, and being&#xD;
resolved not to be taken, either " dead or alive," had&#xD;
fired.&#xD;
At Vinegar Hill, near which the accident occurred,&#xD;
he was obliged to stop, both on account of his wound&#xD;
and an arrest for shooting. Here' the excitement&#xD;
caused by the affair was extravagant. The father of&#xD;
the runaway young lady was one of-the wounded,&#xD;
and further pursuit was given up for the time. As&#xD;
Allen proved upon examination, that lie had fired in&#xD;
self-defence, he was acquitted. More than that, lie&#xD;
became a hero. The Irish, who love fighting, were&#xD;
delighted at the short work made of his assailants by&#xD;
'the young American. All the stories of Americanm&#xD;
prowess ever heard, were fully corroborated by this&#xD;
young man's spirited reception of the assailants, and&#xD;
rich and poor did him honor during his stay among&#xD;
them. Nothing like revenge was excited by the fact&#xD;
that he had shot their countryman, but only admira-&#xD;
tion of the manner of doing it.&#xD;
Marion found her new relation of sister now plac-&#xD;

beyond Allen's ideas of propriety, was sometimes&#xD;
great. However, she addressed herself to her new&#xD;
duties with cheerfulness, and was rewarded by see-&#xD;
ing her patient improve under her care.&#xD;
Vinegar lill was a place memorable for scenes of&#xD;
bloodshed, and Marion regarded it with interest-.&#xD;
Not much could be gathered from the inhabitants&#xD;
concerning these events, and all parties seemed to&#xD;
think it best it should be forgotten. The Catholic&#xD;
power was still strong enough there to resnact them&#xD;
any day, should the occasion present-.&#xD;
Both Protestant and Catholics were very kind to&#xD;
Allen during his confinement, and ministers of' both&#xD;
churches visited him often in the capacity of their&#xD;
holy office. Neither would one learn from what they&#xD;
taught, that there was much difference of sentiment&#xD;
between them; Christ being honored alike by them&#xD;
with zeal befitting apostles. While it was thought&#xD;
Allen was in some danger from his wound, the poor&#xD;
exhibited great anxiety concerning his soul; when-&#xD;
ever they came near him making gestures and say-&#xD;
ing prayers with great energy, and imploring him to&#xD;
"think of' his God," in repeated adj urations. All&#xD;
these attentions, however, failed to make the invalid&#xD;
more religious. His ideas of religion were widely&#xD;
different from that practised about him, and lhe&#xD;
shrunk with dislike from those mummeries. "Tie had&#xD;
already," he said, "seen religion enough in Ireland,&#xD;
was there any virtue in it, to have cured all its suffer-&#xD;
ing and sorrow; as for him, he wanted none of it."&#xD;
It was indeed enough to know that these meek-vis-&#xD;

ignorant crowds, cunningly stirring up the wildest&#xD;

followers of the meek and lowly Jesus, lie had about&#xD;
as little regard for ministers and bishops, living in&#xD;
splendor, and accumulating riches which are extorted&#xD;
from a people who are left hungry, ragged, dirty and&#xD;
destitute after having given up to them the fruits of&#xD;
their labors. These extortioners, ever whining over&#xD;
their arduous and self-denying labor, are making for-&#xD;
tunes with -more ease than any other class of men.&#xD;
A bishop cannot even change his robe after the&#xD;
morning service without a boy to assist him, and to&#xD;
turn out arid hand him his wine. He has a clerk to&#xD;
read over a considerable portion of the service, and&#xD;
the labor that he does, is to preach a sermon, the&#xD;
zest of which is to enjoin upon his hearers loyalty,&#xD;
both to Church and State.&#xD;
Ini the IRomnish Church the principal requirement&#xD;
is to be a good confessor of sins, and payer of taxes.&#xD;
Sometimes the priest has to preach a-scathing sermon&#xD;
to get the rents promptly from the miserable wretches.&#xD;
Marion listened to one such from Father Murphy&#xD;
while staying at Vinegar Hill. The holy Father&#xD;
took fomr his text the parable of the rich man and&#xD;
Lazarus ; and his sermon was after the manuelr fol-&#xD;
lowing : " There was a rich inan, anmd there was, and&#xD;
shiure and there was, and he died and he did, and&#xD;
shure. Och, and lie went to hell, and he did ;&#xD;
because not one of his taxes would he pay. And&#xD;

shure a poor man died, and he did, and he was taken&#xD;
up to Abraham's bosom. And- shure Father Mur-&#xD;
phy will die, he will, and when he goes up to the&#xD;
gate, St. Pether will meet him, and he'll say-&#xD;
'Father Murphy, what have you been doing down&#xD;
there.' But shure he knows all about it. Bad luck&#xD;
to me, if I don't tell him, and he'll say : ' well done&#xD;
Father Murphy, go right into Abraham's bosom.'&#xD;
And you'll die, and you will, and you'll go to hell&#xD;

Anid you'll look up and see Father Murphy in- Abra-&#xD;

send a drop of wather and put on our tongues, for&#xD;
we are tormented in this place down here.' Bad&#xD;
cess to me, if I send you one drop. Troth, I'll spit&#xD;
on you ;" and his reverence leaned over the pulpit to&#xD;
show what lie would do hereafter. The excited&#xD;
expression on the faces of his hearers showed plainly&#xD;
what they felt. lHe had been- their only spiritual&#xD;
friend on earth, and if lie should desert them here-&#xD;
after what would be their conditions Taxes were&#xD;
paid as soon as could be, and the threatened disappro-&#xD;
bation averted.&#xD;
The announcement that the curate of the Pro-&#xD;
testant church was to read the queen's proclamation,&#xD;
and preach a sermon, drew Marion to listen to that.&#xD;
This gentleman went on to say, that lie had received&#xD;
his official call soon after taking his oath of allegi-&#xD;
ance to the youthful queen; and to tell how earni-&#xD;
estly lie had prayed that God would dispose the heart&#xD;
of the royal maiden so as to make her a nursling&#xD;
mother to the Church, and shield it from the wolf of&#xD;

Rome. At that allusion, a sensation was noticeable&#xD;
among the Romians, and some mutterings were&#xD;
heard. Stronger demonstrations were prevented by&#xD;
the presence of the police. The curate went on to&#xD;
say, how much the nation were indebted to George&#xD;
I., who had left them basking in the sunshine of*&#xD;
honor and security, and all the temporal benefits of-&#xD;
a long Christian reign. Truth, uprightness and the&#xD;
blessings of a grateful world encircled the brow of&#xD;
that monarch, who would let his head come to the&#xD;
block sooner than endanger British greatness and&#xD;
glory, by permiittiug any to slight his authority.&#xD;
Tears ran down the cheeks of the preacher as lie&#xD;
spoke of that moment, when God removed this " Cha-&#xD;
riot of Israel and the horsemen thereof"-and ex-&#xD;
changed for him his earthly crown for a heavenly.&#xD;
He reminded his congregation of the terrible judg-&#xD;
ments which swallowed up those who murmured&#xD;
against Moses and Aaron. lHe impressed on them&#xD;
the important duty of loyal submission to the Queen&#xD;
and Houses of Lords and Commons; and assured&#xD;
them it was the best way to secure the blessing of&#xD;
God, and worldly prosperity, lie reminded them&#xD;
how parliament was laboring for the Church, which&#xD;
had been shorn of her bishoprics, and defrauded of&#xD;
her (hues, and in every way discouraged. After&#xD;
speaking some time on the great things accomplished&#xD;
by the Church, the speaker alluded to a class of peo-&#xD;
ple who had withdrawn themselves from her influ-&#xD;
ence, and gone to studying Cyclopoedias and using&#xD;
reason and philosophy, until they had made infidels&#xD;

effect of his sermon was to throw a gloom over her&#xD;
mind. It reminded her of the power and might&#xD;
of those social sinls from which she had so long&#xD;
been suffering, and from which she must continue to&#xD;
rebel until she had freed herself from them. She&#xD;
could not help remembering that the preacher had&#xD;
said nearly all revolutionary movements and dis-&#xD;
turbances of the peace had been set on foot by men&#xD;
professedly opposed to Christianity ; anti had alluded&#xD;
to the condition of American society, in no comph-&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
LORD POTTRn had been all kindness and attention,&#xD;
both to Allen and his sister, during their compulsory&#xD;
stay at Vinegar Hill ; and now, as Allen thought him-&#xD;
self able to travel and was very impatient to be gone, the&#xD;
party again set out toward Dublin, reaching the town&#xD;
of Wexford, after several days' travel. Tile appear.&#xD;
anice of tile country was glorious in the absence of&#xD;
any sights of shlockinIg want or distress. Allen was&#xD;
resolved to see tile inside of some of the farmers'&#xD;
houses, anmd accordingly ordered a dinner at one of&#xD;
the better-looking sort. Marion was wicked enough&#xD;
to enjoy tile occasion, as she knew pretty well what&#xD;
they would find ; and knew Allen's curiosity was to&#xD;
see what they had to eat, and how they proceeded&#xD;
to eat it when prepared.&#xD;
Ie soon had an opportunity to gratify his curiosity.&#xD;
Potatoes, boiled and mashled, were put into a large&#xD;
wooden bowl; then into tile centre of the potato&#xD;
mountain, in which was previously made a crater,&#xD;
were poured a little melted butter, and some warm&#xD;
milk. This dish was put upon the table, and thme&#xD;
guests invited to partake. Had not tile family set&#xD;
the example, Allen would scarcely have known how to&#xD;
proceed, as the table wvas not set with plates, and only&#xD;
furnished with iron spoons5 with which each person took&#xD;
up a part of a spoonful of the potato, and dipping it&#xD;
into tihe dressing in thle centre, conveyed it to his&#xD;

mouth. This was, however, rather more stylish than&#xD;
the usual mode, which is to gather about a basket of&#xD;
boiled potatoes, with their coats still on, a lid eat them&#xD;
frommi tile hand, ~vith a little seasoning of salt. If they&#xD;
only have enough to satisfy hunger they are well&#xD;
pleased. hut, even if they have not, tile Irish will&#xD;
divide with a neighbor or stran(ter. Sometimes, when&#xD;
there is scarcity, tile fi~ther and mnothei' portion out the&#xD;
food to the children ; but, if a stranger enters the&#xD;
house, each child makes haste to be first to offer his or&#xD;
her best potato as a hospitality offering. If it is not&#xD;
accepted and eaten, there is offence given. Allen, in&#xD;
seeing? the cOIi(litiOli of the Irish at home, was enabled&#xD;
to lln(lel'stalid the rapid improvement they make in&#xD;
America.&#xD;
In approachiiiig Carri g Fe#ry, Carrig Castle is the&#xD;
object of greatest interest to the stranger. it has a&#xD;
lonely situation on the rocky coast, and the broken&#xD;
outline of the lofty tower gives it a look as if the god&#xD;
of war had tossed the rocks into those fantastic&#xD;
sluLpes; surely not as if mortal man had ever placed&#xD;
them there for mortal use. Few of the Irish will go&#xD;
near it, on account of the fearful ghost-stories told&#xD;
about it; but Allen, though still feeble, could not&#xD;
let pass by so good an opportunity for adventure.&#xD;
.U2e resolved to discover the secret of its terrors, if&#xD;
terrors it really had; and, in spite of Lord Potter's&#xD;
persuasions to the contrary, made preparations to pay&#xD;
it a visit. The keeper of the castle, a very old man,&#xD;
could relate many wonderful stories about it, which&#xD;
only increased Allen's determination to know more&#xD;
of it., When lie expressed his intention of visiting it&#xD;

&#xD;
at the hour when ghosts were visible, the old man&#xD;
declared it to be a strange desire, and even Potter&#xD;
had some doubts about the safety of the enterprise.&#xD;
Allen's theory about ghosts ~ that they could be&#xD;
put to rest by a loaded revolver, and, in the anticipa-&#xD;
tion of an attempt to frighten him, he took care to&#xD;
provide hhnsclf with this disenchantment. The hour&#xD;
of nightfall was thought to l)e as prolific of spectres&#xD;
as any, therefore, Allen chose that hour, much to tile&#xD;
anxiety of the old keeper, who did not care to show&#xD;
the castle at that time. however, he got a reluctant&#xD;
consent, and conlmence(l the tour of the deserted&#xD;
apartments. They had not proceeded long, when&#xD;
both were startled by sounds which Allen knew could&#xD;
not be echo ; they were much more like a muffled&#xD;
drum. The keeper became frightened, and begged&#xD;
him to return, which lie would not consent to do&#xD;
giving the old man pem'nmission to do so, however, if&#xD;
lie would intrust him with tIme keys. The warder&#xD;
was ashamed to desert a stranger in his own castle,&#xD;
and kept on with him up to tIme first story. here a&#xD;
beautiful view of the Sloney repaid the toil of ascend-&#xD;
ing tIme long staircase. Forming itself into a bay at&#xD;
this place, it tries to rival the sea in appearance, and&#xD;
throws out long embracing arms, that curve in that&#xD;
direction. Wimilo Allen admired this View froimm a&#xD;
window, lie was trying to quiet the apprehensions of&#xD;
his guide, by telling him that all stories of ghosts&#xD;
originated with bands of outlaws, or criminals hiding&#xD;
b&#xD;
away from justice; that all Qese appearances had a&#xD;
natural cause. They had not gone far, thus reassured,&#xD;
when the sound of groans came plainly upon their&#xD;

ears; yet Allen would not be turned back, but di-&#xD;
verted the guide by asking if the place was never&#xD;
used as a prison, which the old man said it was not.&#xD;
They now ('aine to a chamber, in which were piles of&#xD;
huiiian bones. These were said to have been left&#xD;
here by Robert Fitzpherne, in 1169; and that if any&#xD;
one ventures to remove them, they will be replaced.&#xD;
Allen looked at sonic of them closely, and came to&#xD;
the conclusion that they had been covered with flesh,&#xD;
not as long ago as that.&#xD;
All Allen's rhetoric could not persuade the guide to&#xD;
go any further with him that evening ; therefore he&#xD;
took the keys, as before proposed, and after lighting&#xD;
the old man down the staircase, returned and pro-&#xD;
ceeded alone. While examining one chamber, he was&#xD;
satisfied he heard voices beneath the floor, and, in&#xD;
such a way as left little doubt of the existence of a&#xD;
trap-door communicating with the lower 1room, and&#xD;
opening into the one lie was in. Preparing himself&#xD;
for an adventure, he began cautiously to look for the&#xD;
secret door, which, after a little search, he found.&#xD;
Carefully placing his light where it could not be put&#xD;
out, he proceeded to raise the trap. As he did so, he&#xD;
took care that his hat should be mistaken for his&#xD;
head. lie had calculated correctly, for, in an instant&#xD;
the deceiving hat was pierced through with a pistol&#xD;
ball, after which all was still except Allen's counter-&#xD;
feit groans. Soon a ferocious looking fellow thrust&#xD;
his shoulders above the opening, and, glancing&#xD;
cautiously about him, finally sprang up through the&#xD;
door and proceeded to look for the intruder. Lying&#xD;
perfectly still, Allen awaited his approach, and&#xD;

watched his movements ; when, perceiving the fellow&#xD;
was about to strike him with his heavy horse-pistol&#xD;
on discovering that lie was alive, lie let go a bullet&#xD;
from his revolver, and the outlaw fell dead.&#xD;
having thus dispatched one very material ghost,&#xD;
Allen proceeded to look for another, as lie suspected&#xD;
there night be more where this omie came froni.&#xD;
Bringing his light he descended to survey the h)l~lce,&#xD;
when wonder of wonders! a little blue-eyed fairy-&#xD;
girl ~vas discovered, curled up in a corner, shivering&#xD;
with fright. half child, half woman, pale, famished&#xD;
and terrified, she smote his manly heart with pity.&#xD;
As speedily as possible, lie hurried her out of her&#xD;
dungeon, though she scarce could assist his efforts&#xD;
with her own strength. lie did not stop long to&#xD;
question her, but hastened with her back to the&#xD;
apartment of the keeper, glad to breathe free air once&#xD;
more. The old man stared like one demented, with-&#xD;
out speaking.&#xD;
"These are the ghosts you keep, you old rascal !"&#xD;
cried Allen, as soon as lie could get his breath from&#xD;
fatigue.&#xD;
"holy Mother !" exclaimed the old man, "who is&#xD;
she, and where did you find her ?"&#xD;
"Where I expected to, in one of your dark cham-&#xD;
bers. I told you 1 could find living ghosts, if any, in&#xD;
these infernal old dens, that you keep so choicely, as&#xD;
gems of amitiquity."&#xD;
Allen vouchsafed no further information to the&#xD;
keeper of ghosts, but retiirned to his friends as fast as&#xD;
his own condition and that of his prize wonld allow.&#xD;

usual spectacle from the public eye ; and only Lord&#xD;
I~otter and Marion were aroused from anxiety to aston-&#xD;
ishment by his reappearance in such company. his&#xD;
lordship brought wine for them, amid soon learned the&#xD;
history of the adventure, which brought to light so&#xD;
palpable) if delicate a spectre.&#xD;
The account which Aimie Stewart gave of herself,&#xD;
was as follows: She was born at lirniingh am,&#xD;
England. 11cr flithier was a gentleman of rank, who&#xD;
married her mother clandestinely, and shortly. after-&#xD;
ward forsook her, rather than lose his birthright.&#xD;
11cr mother's father, incensed at the trouble brought&#xD;
upon hini by her unfortunate marriage, refused to&#xD;
receive her back again; amid, after' lingering along&#xD;
until Annie's birth, she (lied of grief. Thurman&#xD;
Stewart was married again before the death of Annie's&#xD;
mother; but the flict of his first clandestine marriage&#xD;
becoming known to his father, the grandfather of lit-&#xD;
tle Annie, the child was taken and adopted into the&#xD;
family. Something like remorse for the cruelty&#xD;
toward the (lead, caused the Stewarts to&#xD;
treat the 0r1)han with kindness until the death of her&#xD;
grandfather, when the selfislmess of her stepmother&#xD;
being aroused by the knowledge that, by a legal dis-&#xD;
tribution of property, Annie would get the largest&#xD;
portion, began to cause persecution, and finally she&#xD;
was sent to Ireland to be out of the way. Whether&#xD;
her father knew how she had been disposed of she&#xD;
could not tell; but the fact of her banishmciit was&#xD;
good reasQil for presuming lie would not have inter-&#xD;
fered.&#xD;
Thus, by a decree of fortune, Allen was made the&#xD;

guardian of a young and destitute girl. To leave her&#xD;
in Ireland, already overrun with helpless children,&#xD;
without any knowledge of labor, and unused to the&#xD;
habits of the poor, would be to doom her to the con-&#xD;
dition of those miserable wretches lie had everywhere&#xD;
seen, and was not to be thought ot~ To retain her in&#xD;
their company would be to take a great risk on them-&#xD;
selves, lie could pass her off, in her present con-&#xD;
dition, and with her English pronunciation, for his&#xD;
sister, as he has done Miss Wallace; and, curiosity&#xD;
once aroused about them, the whole party might be&#xD;
suspected of some impropriety. On the other hand,&#xD;
the affifir at the castle had transpired, and the igno-&#xD;
rant, excitable people were inclined to be offended with&#xD;
Allen for disturbing their belief in ghosts. The old&#xD;
keeper, too, was very much distressed about what&#xD;
had takemi plac~7~ He had lived a long life in the full&#xD;
confidence that he was the keeper of ghosts. Never&#xD;
having harmed any one himself, he had no fears of&#xD;
being haunted by them, and it was a decided dis-&#xD;
tinction to be able to entertain others with remark-&#xD;
able accounts of ghostly doings in which other people&#xD;
figured, while he only held the keys. The case now&#xD;
bid fair to be altered. The man Allen had murdered&#xD;
in the tower, might accuse him of having been instru-&#xD;
mental in causing his death by introducing the Ame-&#xD;
rican to the castle; and might revenge himself upon&#xD;
him in sonic horrible ghostly manner. his only&#xD;
hope was that the man might have been a Protestant,&#xD;
in which case the priest could give him a charm to&#xD;
keep away his phantom. The giving of charms, or&#xD;
settling of ghosts, was quite a lucrative business to the&#xD;

priests. Even a Protestant can receive a charm, if&#xD;
he comes with the Bible in his hand to get it, and&#xD;
the ceremony of settling the ghost is very simple. The&#xD;
Ilaunte(l pcz-~on demands of the spectre three times,&#xD;
"who are yo~i, and what do you want?" If it is not&#xD;
the devil himself the ghost will be compelled to&#xD;
answer; and may then be commanded to disappear&#xD;
and never return. If it does not obey under these&#xD;
circumstances, the proof is considered conclusive that&#xD;
the devil has appeared to the haunted person.&#xD;
As they were situated at Carrig Ferry, the&#xD;
party thought it advisable to ufake all convenient&#xD;
haste to get away, and Marion made use of her skill&#xD;
in contriving a suitabk wardrobe for Annie Stewart&#xD;
out of a portion of her own, now none too ~vell sup-&#xD;
plied. Lord Potter confessed himself ashamed of&#xD;
his country. "This is the end," said he to Allen,&#xD;
"of all your romance about old castles, and gems of&#xD;
antiquity.' Their end is likely to prove as infamous&#xD;
as their origin, which, in many cases, was infamous&#xD;
enough. Many are the scenes of blood and violence&#xD;
their crumbling walls have witnessed; scenes damna-&#xD;
ble enough to have given them over to evil spirits&#xD;
to haunt, and it is not surprising the people fanc5r&#xD;
them thins occupied."&#xD;
There was no time, however, for the discussion of&#xD;
such matters, lest Somebody might take it into hi~&#xD;
head to enter a complaint against them, and cause&#xD;
them delay, or, possibly imprisonment, and perhaps&#xD;
tind them worthy of death, a consummation most&#xD;
earnestly to be avoided. An Irishman may like to&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
because thereby lie gains the approbation of his&#xD;
priest, and the name of a patriot; but Allen had no&#xD;
such ambition. A Protestant might desire to get&#xD;
into difficulty jn order to say that lie had been con-&#xD;
tending for his God, his Bible, or his Queen. Allen&#xD;
did not wish even to distinguish himself in this man-&#xD;
ner, therefore the order was given to go on immc-&#xD;
diately, notwithstandin~ a lit rest&#xD;
b     tle further   would&#xD;
have benefited Allen, and improved Annie's condi-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
But a strong fear of the consequences to one or&#xD;
both the ladies of the company, going to Dublin,&#xD;
where they might be recognized by any chance&#xD;
acquaintance or relation happening there, impelled&#xD;
Lord Potter to oppose the movement. Since Annie's&#xD;
advent, -Allen had confessed to him the identity of&#xD;
Miss Wallace with Miss Cunningham, and the result&#xD;
was, his advice to leave both ladies upon the road in&#xD;
some place as secure as possible to find, until they&#xD;
could complete that mission to Dublin.&#xD;
This latter proposition was opposed by Marion, who&#xD;
not only feared to be left in this way; but wished to&#xD;
he where she might be earning something, if tarry&#xD;
she must, upon her journey, before returning to&#xD;
America. Many plans were talked over; but&#xD;
Marion's plan was to go to Glasgow, Scot land, taking&#xD;
Annie with her, and there remain, until Allen had&#xD;
either succeeded or failed in his attempt to see&#xD;
Woods, and otherwise fultilled his intentions with&#xD;
regard to travel in Ireland and England. Lord Pot-&#xD;
ter was of opinion that this would be a safe, feasible&#xD;
plan, and it was finally adopted, with the amend-&#xD;

ixient that Allen should accompany the ladies, and&#xD;
afterward join Lord Potter in Dublin. The party&#xD;
then set out with this new arrangement, Lord Potter&#xD;
going on to their original destination, and Allen turn-&#xD;
ing off to Wicklow to get a vessel for Belfast and&#xD;
Glasgow.&#xD;
Marion was rather better pleased with the prospect&#xD;
of going to Scotland than at the first thought she&#xD;
had been; for the several difficulties in the way of&#xD;
her remaining longer in Ireland seemed to magnify&#xD;
themselves as they were more carefully considered.&#xD;
However much she might wish to see her lover, or&#xD;
even to be near him, her very presence might entan-&#xD;
gle him in further difficulties, should it by any chance&#xD;
become known. Again, the state of her purse&#xD;
warned her that she should soo~i ~be dependent upon&#xD;
strangers unless she could find means to replenish it.&#xD;
From what she had heard of Scotland, she hoped to&#xD;
find the poor in a better condition than in Ireland,&#xD;
and to procure some more honorable employment&#xD;
than Ireland furnished her laboring classes. She&#xD;
thought of the factories of Glasgow, and felt sure of&#xD;
doing something for herself if she could only get an&#xD;
engii~ement to work in one of them. And again,&#xD;
Annie must be provided for with her in some way,&#xD;
until her guardian's return, as All en had expressed his&#xD;
determination to take her to his mother in the United&#xD;
States. Notwithstanding this resolution, Marion&#xD;
thought it best Annie should be taught some kind of&#xD;
useful labor, which would raise her above depen-&#xD;
dence in any event. By her own teaching and exam-&#xD;
ple she believed she could make the young girl love&#xD;
&#xD;
independence, and fit her for the orphaned and pen-&#xD;
niless fate which had befallen her. These thoughts,&#xD;
however much they entered into her plans, she had&#xD;
not mentioned to Allen; because lie, with all the airs&#xD;
of a young lord, had decided to adopt and educate&#xD;
Annie, and provide for her as a lady should be pro-&#xD;
vV4~d for. The child had taken hold of his heart&#xD;
from the moment of her discovery, and he planned&#xD;
for her already as if she had been his sister. Marion&#xD;
knew the time would come, at no great distance&#xD;
either, ~vhen Annie would feel this generosity bur-&#xD;
densome, and her position humiliating; so she made&#xD;
her plans accordingly.&#xD;
But while Marion was scheming, there were other&#xD;
schemes than hers on foot. The old keeper of Car-&#xD;
rig Castle had been on the alert to arrest the move-&#xD;
ments of this gho~t-ahdncting party, and at a turn of&#xD;
the road, a few miles from their resting-place, a&#xD;
party of seven stout Irishmen suddenly intercepted&#xD;
their progress with fierce looks and fiercer words,&#xD;
demanding their names, and business in these parts.&#xD;
Allen's native wit and assurance served him here,&#xD;
however, as it had often done before. "My* name,"&#xD;
said he, "is B. F. Allen, at your service,, and my&#xD;
business is to make friends with the Irish. I am&#xD;
from the United States, where you have a brother,&#xD;
unless I am mistaken," addressing himself to the lea-&#xD;
der of the gang.&#xD;
"That's thrue," answered the fellow, taken by sur-&#xD;
prise. "Its meself that has that same, shure. And&#xD;
do ye's know Pat Maloney ?"&#xD;
"That's the name," said Allen, readily; "he wanted&#xD;

I should ~ee you, and ask if any more of the folks&#xD;
were coming out; and if they were, he wanted inc to&#xD;
take them back with me?'&#xD;
Presto-change! They were all kindness in a&#xD;
moment, for Maloney's friends were as much inter-&#xD;
ested in America as himself. Those who had not&#xD;
relatives in that country, could inquire after old&#xD;
neighbors; and Allen was asked to wait until they&#xD;
could get some whisky to drink with him. But&#xD;
Allen told his late enemies that he had to go to&#xD;
Wickford and back, in a certain, length of time, and&#xD;
could not stop then; but that, on his return, he would&#xD;
see them and any other Irish, who wished to converse&#xD;
about America. In return for this promise, they&#xD;
earnedd him not to be out after six o'clock in the&#xD;
evening, as, from that hour to six in the morning, the&#xD;
laborers on the estates were at liberty, and he might&#xD;
meet with unpleasant adventures. Thanking them&#xD;
for this warning, Allen parted from his new friends,&#xD;
and many a hearty "God bless you" sounded after&#xD;
him.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
ARRIVING at Wicklow, the party took ship for Bel-&#xD;
fast, reaching that place on the 12th of July, just in&#xD;
tune to witness the celebration of that day, which&#xD;
commemorates the Battle ot~ the Boyne. It would&#xD;
have been a grand sight, l)Ut for the fact of its being&#xD;
so annoying to the iRomanists.&#xD;
A 1)roc~siomm, three miles in length, of ~vell-dressed&#xD;
people, made quite an imposing appearance. As&#xD;
Allen afterward learned, the rich Protestants made&#xD;
arrangements to furnish comfortable clothing to all&#xD;
who wished to walk with the Orangemen. An&#xD;
Prince of&#xD;
orange and purple flag, with William,&#xD;
Orange, painted on it, floated from the steeple of a&#xD;
church; and soldiers were parading all the streets.&#xD;
The IRoninanists would soon have made a struggle to&#xD;
bring down that obnoxious flag, had the church not&#xD;
been inside of a nobleman's castle wall. As it was,&#xD;
the celebration went on quite orderly. The proces-&#xD;
sion was made up of lodges, of forty or fifty mem-&#xD;
bers, and as many men, women and children as they&#xD;
could induce to join them; all carrying poles,&#xD;
trimmed with orange ribbons, orange lilies, and blue&#xD;
rockets. Each lodge, also, had a large flag, and a&#xD;
band of music playing every air most likely to mor-&#xD;
tify or exasperate the poor IRomanists, or "croppies,"&#xD;
as the Protestants call them in contempt. One song,&#xD;

&#xD;
our travellers noticed, which was uncommonly pro-&#xD;
voking, the chorus being:&#xD;
"Down, down, croppv, lie dowi,&#xD;
Up with the orange and down with the grecn,&#xD;
The face of a croppy should never be seen."&#xD;
The "Boyne Waters," another annoying composi-&#xD;
tion, was frequently given. But the iRomanists kept&#xD;
their doors and windows closed until the Protestants&#xD;
had got through their parade, and so saved an open&#xD;
humiliation.&#xD;
All the Protestant public houses were open to the&#xD;
crowds to drink and toast to their heart's desire; so&#xD;
that, should there be any difficulty during the night,&#xD;
the party of Americans were in a good position to&#xD;
become mixed up with it. But, they were reserved&#xD;
for a greater distinction.&#xD;
The bishop having heard that an American gentle-&#xD;
man, with ladies, was stopping at the hotel-and&#xD;
fearing it might not be altogether pleasant at that&#xD;
time, sent an invitation to the party to stop at his&#xD;
house. Allen accepted the invitation very gladly,&#xD;
introducing Marion as his step-sister, as usual, and&#xD;
Annie as a young girl, travelling under their care,&#xD;
going to her mother in Scotland.&#xD;
The same style of conversation was repeated here&#xD;
that had entertained them in Cork. The good bishop&#xD;
had much to say about the United States, and the&#xD;
pride the mother country took in her daughter; but&#xD;
alluded to her still crude manners and sentiments, as&#xD;
if they were natural to her age; and hoped the mis-&#xD;
sionaries sent out by England would have a good&#xD;
influence in remodellim~g those sentiments!&#xD;
&#xD;
"To what did he refer in particular ?" Allen asked.&#xD;
"To the sentiment of universal elevation," said the&#xD;
bishop. "Of course a gentleman may rise in intel-&#xD;
lect and in the social scale; but, that any common&#xD;
htborer may conic to be President, is simply repulsive&#xD;
and unnatural. it is a false sentiment, and ought not&#xD;
to be encouraged. I hear of apprentice boys in your&#xD;
country rising step by step, until they stand in the&#xD;
halls of your National Legislature."&#xD;
"Very well," said Allen, "what objection do you&#xD;
make to that sort of elevation? Is not England wil-&#xD;
ling her sons should rise to any position they are&#xD;
fitted for ?"&#xD;
"Ah, yes, we are willing, provided they advance&#xD;
by the straight and narrow path provided for those&#xD;
who aspire to greatness or renown. But, to have tIme&#xD;
people rushing up on every side and claiming to have&#xD;
a right to this way, would soon bring about a very&#xD;
unpleasant state of public affairs. It is the order of&#xD;
nature. and heaven that there should be grades of&#xD;
rank; and where these are best preserved, there is the&#xD;
best order. A peasant has no right, to aspire to he a&#xD;
prince."&#xD;
"That depends on the peasant's capacity t&amp;amp; rule,"&#xD;
said Allen. "It might happen he would make a&#xD;
better king than his Royal highness. In our nation,&#xD;
we give men an opportunity to test this capacity; and&#xD;
change our dynasty when we choose, or whenever&#xD;
the new candidate for honors seems most worthy of&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"You will get over this Republicanism when you&#xD;
get wiser," said the bishop. At that moment dinner&#xD;

wgs announced. The table of his lordship was a&#xD;
splendid display of plate and good liquors. Here,&#xD;
agaHi, Allen created surprise, by declining to drink&#xD;
wine. "I never allow myself to become enthusias-&#xD;
tic," said the bishop; which remark was intended to&#xD;
rebuke his guest's ultra temperance principles. But&#xD;
whatever rel)uguance the bishop might have had to&#xD;
enthusiasm in abstaining from ~vine, he gave a pretty&#xD;
good evidence of warmth in the indulgence of it.&#xD;
The hrst sentiment that was drunk, was in the follow-&#xD;
ing style:&#xD;
"Come, let us every orange man&#xD;
Take a full glass in his hand,&#xD;
And drink to William's memory,&#xD;
Who, on the twelfth day of July,&#xD;
Conceived the plan that freed us all&#xD;
From Popery's detested tiiraii.&#xD;
So, fill the glass once and again,&#xD;
Aiid drink to him, ye Orange men,&#xD;
Until the day you die l"&#xD;
The bishop responded by drinking to the words:&#xD;
"- the goose that raised the quill,&#xD;
That signed the Emancipation Bill."&#xD;
A third drank, "To the Pope in , and the&#xD;
Devil throwing priests at him."&#xD;
A fourth:&#xD;
"     O'Connell and all his tricks-.&#xD;
- the priest and his crucifix-&#xD;
the Pope and all his crew,&#xD;
And      the man that would not -   him, too I"&#xD;
The excitement of religion and wine *was becoming&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
so strong at this dinner, that, at the earliest possible&#xD;
moment, the ladies excused themselves and retired&#xD;
from table. Allen soon followed them, disgusted&#xD;
with the songs and toasts he heard. Just as he was&#xD;
leaving the table, the name of Bishop Fm'edonia was&#xD;
announced. Though Allen could not quite connect&#xD;
the name with any one he knew, it sounded familiar,&#xD;
and lie mentioned it to Marion, who was instantly&#xD;
alarmed and insisted on making an excuse to return&#xD;
to the hotel. Allen accordingly sent word he had&#xD;
determined to take a steamer that iiight, and hurried&#xD;
back to his hotel hoping to find one going out. They&#xD;
were, however, compelled to remain ; though both&#xD;
the ladies were in a state of constant anxiety.&#xD;
Marion feared that, if discovered to be there by&#xD;
Bishop Fredonia, she should be seized at once, as an&#xD;
absconding, disobedient daughter, arid ~he well knew&#xD;
the public sentiment would be against her. And&#xD;
Annie knew equally well that, if anything befell&#xD;
Marion, it would expose her to suspicion and per-&#xD;
haps ill-treatment, which she feared her generous pro-&#xD;
tector had not the power to prevent.&#xD;
As had been apprehended, about midnight a quar-&#xD;
rel broke out between the Romans and Protestants,&#xD;
after the soldiers had retired. The hotel where Allen&#xD;
was stopping was surrounded and filled to overflow-&#xD;
ing. "Smash everything ?" was the cry of the&#xD;
assailants, and to their work they went with a good&#xD;
will. Allen ran to the apartment occupied by the&#xD;
ladies, and succeeded in getting in and locking the&#xD;
door behind him. The riot went on with vigor,&#xD;
women carried their aprons full of stones for their&#xD;

&#xD;
husbands to hurl at the Protestants, and the confu-&#xD;
Sion was perfectly demoniac on both sides. No one&#xD;
molested the Americans, however, and when quiet&#xD;
was restored, they thanked their good fortune on this&#xD;
occasion in keeping out of harm's way. Still, Allen&#xD;
did not feel quite like going to bed, as thei'e was no&#xD;
certainty of the peace continuing, and the little party&#xD;
remained together in Marion's apartment. Indeed,&#xD;
Annie's nervous condition seemed to make it neces-&#xD;
sary to stay by her during the night. She was suf-&#xD;
fering terribly from fright and excitement, which, in&#xD;
her delicate health, was greatly to be deplored. Not&#xD;
so Marion. After the first thrill of apprehension was&#xD;
over she became calm again, and armed herself&#xD;
coolly for resistance. This, Wowever, now began to&#xD;
seem unnecessary, as the noise had all died away.&#xD;
About an hour after quiet was restored, and just&#xD;
as their eyelids began to droop heavily with sleepi-&#xD;
ness and fatigue, Marion noticed a whispering in the&#xD;
hall outside her door, and inspired with a sudden&#xD;
dread of Bishop Fredonia, her heart gave one wild&#xD;
bound and she started to her feet. Directly a loud&#xD;
rap upon the door followed, and voices were heard&#xD;
demanding admittance. Upon being asked who&#xD;
were there, no answer was given. Then followed&#xD;
kicks and blows, and more orders to open the door,&#xD;
from a voice which Marion now recognized as that of&#xD;
Andy Dean, the church clerk who us~d to assist the&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Hamilton in the church of Benmare.&#xD;
There was no longer any doubt of his errand, as&#xD;
Marion could distinctly hear him giving orders how&#xD;
to proceed to the gang of Irish whom he was leading&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
.4&#xD;
4&#xD;
4&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
to his cowardly attack. "Be sure you take the&#xD;
girls," was his last order as the door burst open; but&#xD;
the inevitable six shooter did execution as it had&#xD;
done before, and three or four of the intruders bit&#xD;
the dust.&#xD;
"Thunder and hell !" . cried one of the assailants,&#xD;
"it's the devil himself that's in there, and not a con-&#xD;
pie of girls, bad luck to his riverence I" "it's me&#xD;
brother that's kilt," whimpered an old man, trem-&#xD;
bling between grief and fear.&#xD;
The assailants were driven back by the startling&#xD;
reception they had met into the hall, and the police&#xD;
now began to arrive. Seeing that she had nothing&#xD;
to do but to wait the result of affairs, Marion&#xD;
devoted herself to Annie who had fainted at the burst-&#xD;
ing open of the door. The police made an&#xD;
arrest of the whole assaulting party; but upon the&#xD;
representations of the landlord, let Allen remain at&#xD;
liberty, who made the best possible use of his free-&#xD;
dom and his time by hurrying his party on board a&#xD;
steamer at an early hour of the morning.&#xD;
Marion regretted the part of the old clerk, Dean,&#xD;
in the affray that had happened, because she knew he&#xD;
was only the tool of more powerful persons. It was&#xD;
very easy to guess that Elia had communicated with&#xD;
the bishop, and that when he heard of the strangers&#xD;
who had been at his brother prelate's house, their&#xD;
identity was at once presumed upon as certain. The&#xD;
old man had believed himself doing God service, in&#xD;
obeying the orders of the bishop, and bringing to&#xD;
1dm if possible that terrible and ungovernable 6hiid&#xD;
whose misdemeanors had been related to hiiu almost&#xD;

&#xD;
since the time when he registered her birth and bap-&#xD;
tisin. And now, poor old man, he was a prisoner&#xD;
and in disgrace ; away from home and unbefriended&#xD;
even by the bishop who prefers not to be known in&#xD;
the afhdr. All this Marion readily conjectured, and&#xD;
wished she could hcLve done something for his relief,&#xD;
at least to save him from the tread-mill to which&#xD;
there was not much doubt he would be condemned,&#xD;
with the other rioters. It would be a hard thing for&#xD;
tbe old man who, for thirty years, had been parish&#xD;
clerk, respected and regarded as a sort of oracle by&#xD;
the numerous young people whose names he had&#xD;
written from time to time in the church register.&#xD;
But her own safdy and that of Annie demanded&#xD;
her thoughts for the present. The captain of the&#xD;
steamer on board which they were taken was a&#xD;
Scotchinan, which was a favorable circumstance; the&#xD;
Scotch ~iot being 111gb Churchmen. But Allen (lid&#xD;
not enter into particulars to explain the disordered&#xD;
appearance of the party, one of whom was quite ill,&#xD;
and another stained with blood. He only said they&#xD;
had fallen into the hands of the rioters who besieged&#xD;
the inn, and had had their door broken open, which&#xD;
had given the younger lady a great fright. The cap-&#xD;
tain sympathized with them, and said it was the name&#xD;
of Marion Wallace which the people did not like&#xD;
and had stirred up their riotous feelings. Had the&#xD;
lady who l)ore that name been called Bess with a&#xD;
good English-sounding surname, he thought she&#xD;
would have been respected.&#xD;
"But when the lassies get to Scotland, Marion&#xD;
Wallace will be welcome," said the hearty Scotch-&#xD;
&#xD;
man, "and, if they choose, they can tarry at my-&#xD;
house while you return to Ireland."&#xD;
This return spokeii of, wa~ ostensibly to be present&#xD;
at the trial of' the rioters, which, indeed, he had pro-&#xD;
mised to do. Therefore, after listening to a good&#xD;
deal of enthusiastic talk about Wallnee and Bruce,&#xD;
and hearing Marion say she should soon like Scotland&#xD;
better than Ireland, frOm which she was in a fair&#xD;
way to be quite weaned, Allen took leave of his com-&#xD;
panions and returned on the same steamer to Belfast.&#xD;
his presence at the trial was of no great use, inas-&#xD;
much as he could not identify any of the parties ac-&#xD;
cused. Tile could only tell his story of the assault&#xD;
and the manner in which he had defended himself&#xD;
and the ladies, as the fact of killed and wounded&#xD;
already had proven.&#xD;
After the trial, which resulted in the sending&#xD;
several persons to jail, among whom was poor old&#xD;
Mr. Dean, Allen decided not to remain longer in Ire-&#xD;
land at present. Though safe from arrest, he liked&#xD;
not to be exposed to become involved in any of the&#xD;
frequent quarrels between the two religious denomi-&#xD;
nations. The Protestants were decidedly in the as-&#xD;
cendency here, but that only made the Catholics so&#xD;
much the more rancorous and dangerous. Many&#xD;
murders had been committed on the twelfth of July.&#xD;
In some places whole lodges had been cut to pieces,&#xD;
and the priests were instigating this sort of work&#xD;
wherever they dared.&#xD;
To escape from these turbulent scenes, Allen con-&#xD;
eluded to join his friends in England * To attempt to&#xD;
see John Woods, at that time, and before he ceased&#xD;

to be watched by Marion's enemies, would be worse&#xD;
thai~ useless, and only endanger his cause and hers.&#xD;
He was satisfied for the present with his exploits as&#xD;
knight-errant, and resolved to see something of less&#xD;
active life. Writing to Lord Potter not to expect&#xD;
him in Ireland immediately, lie again crossed the&#xD;
channel, and landed in London. There he found Mr.&#xD;
hail and some other friends greatly interested in the&#xD;
World's Fair, which was then on exhibition. But&#xD;
Allen could not get up much relish for this great&#xD;
show, having imbibed a dislike to the spirit of Eng-&#xD;
lish enterprise from seeing so much of the effects of&#xD;
misrule in a portion of the territory of Great Britain.&#xD;
However, he was forced to take some notice of it, and&#xD;
allowed himself to be shown about by Mr. Hall and&#xD;
a young nobleman whom Hall introduced as Lord&#xD;
Murphy. This young English lord conceived the&#xD;
humorous idea of having some sport at the expense&#xD;
of the young man from New Hampshire, and corn-&#xD;
mnenced the acquaintance by a great show of conde-&#xD;
scension and familiarity, making an abortive attempt&#xD;
at aping Yankee manners, but only spoiling his Eng-&#xD;
lish style. We took occasion to direct Allen's atten-&#xD;
tion to the fact that there was being some sensation&#xD;
produced by the presence of a slave from the United&#xD;
States, who had been called upon to represent the&#xD;
black man in America, and requested to make an&#xD;
address upon the subject of American slavery. The&#xD;
delegates from the United States objected to having&#xD;
the subject of slavery dragged before the convention,&#xD;
and contended that a negro was not a proper person&#xD;
to represent any portion of the Republic. They had&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN Two wORLDs.       233&#xD;
&#xD;
been sufficiently annoyed at home by the discussion&#xD;
of slavery, and did not want to listen to it there.&#xD;
Lord Durphy was *quite exultant over the fact that&#xD;
the Americans shrink from having slavery discussed,&#xD;
and vaunted the English love of freedom in tri-&#xD;
niuphant terms.&#xD;
Allen was annoyed by this vain-glorious and empty&#xD;
assumption of liberal principles where there were so&#xD;
many facts to convince a stranger of their utter&#xD;
worthlessness.&#xD;
"I assure your lordship," said he, "that I am a&#xD;
freeman, and desire to see free whites and free blacks,&#xD;
but I cannot tolerate the assurance of a people who&#xD;
presume to sympathize with the sleek, well-fed, and&#xD;
happy American negro, while they have such sights&#xD;
a~ these in their streets (pointing to a miserable wo-&#xD;
man sweeping the crossing), whose factories ~nd&#xD;
mines contain children who never breathe fresh air&#xD;
or look upon the sunlit heavens, and whose mad-&#xD;
houses are filled with the victims of hard labor and&#xD;
poverty. And I do not want to hear of the refine-&#xD;
ment of a nation whose women keep the grog-shops,&#xD;
and mix up freely ~vith beer-drinking men 'at taverns&#xD;
and shops of all kinds."&#xD;
"Damrne, you are getting impertinent," said his&#xD;
lordship, angrily.&#xD;
"When an Englishman introduces such topics,"&#xD;
answered Allen, coolly, "he had best not to be too&#xD;
easily nettled."&#xD;
"Excuse me, ~ replied the young lord; "I&#xD;
ought to have looked for our own faults first, per-&#xD;
haps, before finding out those of our neighbors."&#xD;

&#xD;
"A course seldom pursued by any of us," answered&#xD;
Allen, pleasantly.&#xD;
While the young men were smoothing out their&#xD;
somewhat ruffled tempers, "Matthew the publican"&#xD;
aSked for his penny. Allen threw him a shillino.&#xD;
Next came blind "l3artimeus," to whom Allen threw&#xD;
another shilling. Theii " Mary Magdalene " for her&#xD;
l)ortion, and got a shilling also.&#xD;
"how long are you going to keep throwing~ out&#xD;
shillings ?" asked Lord IDurphy.&#xD;
here are two Inore; and sixpence demanded to&#xD;
send St. Paul to the heathen," answered Allen, toss-&#xD;
ing out the money.&#xD;
"These beggars only get a penny in general," said&#xD;
his lordship, "unless it is the beggars for St. Paul.&#xD;
Should more be given, half London would be blind&#xD;
or lame."&#xD;
"Oh, well," said Allen, "at home we have no&#xD;
beggars, and to give these shillings to these miserable&#xD;
wretches is a sort of luxury of feeling I shall not en-&#xD;
joy in a little while from now."&#xD;
Thus ended a conversation which left neither party&#xD;
the wiser; for Englishmen are hardened in their&#xD;
wrong-doing, and all the talking in the world will&#xD;
never convince them they might do better.&#xD;
Some of Allen's friends urged him to visit' the&#xD;
various places of note usually sought out by strangers&#xD;
-towers and ruins, etc. But Allen had seen enough&#xD;
of ruined castles in Ireland, and refused to be "hum-&#xD;
bugged" any longer. If the English were proud of&#xD;
their relics of barbarism they were welcome to enjoy&#xD;
them; he, for one, was resolved not to worship the&#xD;
&#xD;
remains of a cruel and l)arl)arous age. lie had no&#xD;
taste for seeing a sword rusty with 5OlflC brave mnaii's&#xD;
blood, nor for standing on time spot where some vic-&#xD;
tim of bloody avarice or revenge had died a horrible&#xD;
death. lie was ashamed of the troops of Americans&#xD;
who thronged those places, full of eager interest to&#xD;
see where the fourth Edward had his own bother&#xD;
murdered, and behaving as if they felt the spot pos-&#xD;
sessed some sacred charm; or to see where Lady&#xD;
Jane Grey parted from her husband to see him led&#xD;
to execution; 6r to pass through the same door by&#xD;
which the poor victim herself ~vent out to the same&#xD;
fate; to ~tand in the identical spot where sonic other&#xD;
inhuman tragedy had been performed. Allen knew&#xD;
very well that it was no latent spirit of cruelty which&#xD;
impelled Americans to seek these show places, but&#xD;
only an idle curiosity seeking to amuse itself with&#xD;
something out of the ordinary line of travel. Still, it&#xD;
vexed him that a proud and arrogant nation should&#xD;
keep on show the evidences of their guilt or shame,&#xD;
and that a free and democratic people should show&#xD;
such a desire to make them honorable subjects of&#xD;
enthusiasm.&#xD;
The parks of London and her elegant buildings--&#xD;
her gorgeous dwellings and solemn temples-would&#xD;
have interested Allen at another time. Now his&#xD;
mind was full of unrest from the effects of his late&#xD;

equally glad and surprised to observe that Brown&#xD;
seemed in better spirits than common with him; be-&#xD;
ing full of life, and lavishing money on his own and&#xD;
his friend's pleasures, in a manner hardly warranted&#xD;
by his New England training or fortunes. Allen took&#xD;
the liberty of inquiring into the change noticeable in&#xD;
his friend's affairs; and, in order to make his account&#xD;
of himself understood, it will be necessary to go back&#xD;
about twenty-two years in the young man's history.&#xD;
At the time mentioned, Mrs. Brown, who had re-&#xD;
cently become a widow, was keeping a small tavern&#xD;
in a quiet country town of Yermon1t. Among her&#xD;
guests at dinner, one day, were a lady and gentle-&#xD;
man, who came in a carriage having a coat of arms&#xD;
painted on it. The lady appeared to be ill and much&#xD;
depressed in spirits. She had with her a young babe&#xD;
not six months old. The gentleman was quite talka-&#xD;
tive, and, among other tImings, inquired if she had&#xD;
a large family. MIrs. Brown confessed that, beside&#xD;
her maiden sister, she had no one in the world; at&#xD;
which the gentleman appeared reflective. Her guests&#xD;
took their leave, and Mrs. Brown thought no more&#xD;
about them that day. About midnight she was&#xD;
awakened by the crying of an infant. Supposing&#xD;
&#xD;
some travellers must have come in late, she made&#xD;
haste to get up and attend to their wants. She found&#xD;
no one, however, in the house, and the crying ap-&#xD;
peared to be outside the door; where, sure enough, she&#xD;
soon discovered a basket containing the babe which&#xD;
had been there at dinner. Its clothing and a flask of&#xD;
milk were the only things left for its inheritance. In&#xD;
wonder and pity, Mrs. Brown called upon her maiden&#xD;
sister to come and see what had been left for them,&#xD;
and the two sat up that night with the little stranger.&#xD;
The old maid was rather displeased with the new.&#xD;
coiner for a while, but finally came to like it; and&#xD;
Mrs. Brown was delighted. 11cr lonely heart twined&#xD;
itself around the little stranger, whom she resolved to&#xD;
adopt as her own, not having much fear its cold-&#xD;
hearted parents would ever come to claim it. Nor&#xD;
did they? The child grew to the boy, who was to&#xD;
have all the 1ar~dn~' his active mind craved, and his&#xD;
humble mother's means could procure; and truly she&#xD;
imagined he acquired a "sight on it."&#xD;
But, as all ambition excites more or less envy,&#xD;
Sheldon Brown's good scholarship was the occasion of&#xD;
an effort to mortify him on the part of some of his school-&#xD;
mates, who taunted him with having no father. This&#xD;
terrible gibe entered the boy's heart, and rankled&#xD;
there. Often he asked his good foster-mother the&#xD;
particulars of his desertion by his probable parents,&#xD;
and what clue they had left by which they might be&#xD;
discovered. She gave him all the information she&#xD;
herself possessed, which was but little. A description&#xD;
of the persons after such a lapse of time would be of&#xD;
little service. The only hints she could produce,&#xD;

were a small clasp which was on the child's dress&#xD;
when she took it in, and what she recollected of the&#xD;
arms upon the carriage. This latter, she described to&#xD;
him, and showed him the former. The good woman&#xD;
resented the reproaches cast upon her adopted son&#xD;
deeply. He was the child of sinners, she admitted;&#xD;
but that he was a child of shame, she did not believe,&#xD;
Something would one day turn up to show these evil&#xD;
disposed people that her son was a child of honorable&#xD;
marriage, however his parents had treated him, lie&#xD;
should go to college and receive a gentleman's edu-&#xD;
cation, at all events, and if ever he discovered hi~&#xD;
parents, they should not be ashamed of him. This&#xD;
generosity and forethought on the old lady's part,&#xD;
had turned out well. Sheldon had graduated with&#xD;
honor, and was the pride of his foster-mother's heart.&#xD;
Therefore, when he expressed to her his long kept&#xD;
and earnest desire to go to England, and promised&#xD;
her she should lose nothing by indulging him in this&#xD;
wish-for if he did not find his family he would re-&#xD;
turn content and settle down to a profession-and&#xD;
if he found them he would not forsake her any more for&#xD;
that, she gave him the necessary means and parted&#xD;
with him hopefully.&#xD;
The adventure was successful. After wandering&#xD;
about London for three or four months without ac-&#xD;
complishing anything to aid his search, Sheldon hit&#xD;
upon a plan to find who had made the clasp which he&#xD;
kept carefully with him as evidence. He got together&#xD;
several old directories, and at last found the name of&#xD;
the maker and his place of business. Though he had&#xD;
little hope of finding the individual, he fortunately&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        239&#xD;
&#xD;
did so. By confiding to him his business, he induced&#xD;
him to look over his old books, in the hope of getting&#xD;
a clue there to the name of the purchaser. The old&#xD;
man at last announced that he had sold that clasp and&#xD;
some other articles to son of the iDuke of -.&#xD;
This was good news to Sheldon Brown. lie then&#xD;
inquired what the jeweler knew of the duke's family;&#xD;
and the old man's memory thus refreshed, called up&#xD;
the almost forgotten fact that the duke had a son a&#xD;
number of years ago, who mysteriously disappeared&#xD;
from London, since when he had not been heard of.&#xD;
Here, then, was a difficulty-but Sheldon surmounted&#xD;
it. Requesting the jeweler to keep his secret, lest&#xD;
an alarm might untimely be taken, Sheldon made&#xD;
an occasion when he had an opportunity of question-&#xD;
ing the oldest servant in the duke's employ about the&#xD;
family. Though the servant avoided acknowledging&#xD;
anything, his manner confirmed Sheldon's belief as&#xD;
much as if he had told him his suspicions were cor-&#xD;
rect. Going then to a barrister of considerable re-&#xD;
nown for shrewdness, Sheldon told him all the points&#xD;
in the case already gained, and promised him a con-&#xD;
tingent fee on condition of finding out the rest. The&#xD;
barrister, after some careful investigation, determined&#xD;
to go to the duke and inform him that there were&#xD;
suspicions afloat concerning the fate of his son who&#xD;
had so long been lost in mystery; and that an inves-&#xD;
tigation would be made unless something was done&#xD;
to satisfy the public mind. Thus taken by surprise,&#xD;
after some show of anger at this interference in his&#xD;
family matters, the duke confessed that lie had a son&#xD;
now living in a part of his palace, who was a hope-&#xD;

less lunatic ; and had been so since the time of his&#xD;
disappearance from society. This son had married a&#xD;
wife of low degree, for which offence he incurred the&#xD;
severe displeasure of his father. But pardon was&#xD;
finally promised him, and restoration to rights in case&#xD;
no children were born to this marriage. Unhappily&#xD;
one child had already been born;.and, to secure the&#xD;
duke's favor, the father determined to place it where&#xD;
its existence should never be known ; and for this&#xD;
purpose had gone to America. The poor mother,&#xD;
compelled to abandon her babe so heartlessly, soon&#xD;
drooped and died ; and her death, together with re-&#xD;
morse for deserting his child, overcame the little&#xD;
reason so weakminded a man ever could have had,&#xD;
and lie became a victim to a mild but hopeless mad-&#xD;
ness. Suqh were the circumstances .gathered from&#xD;
the duke's confession. He never had known where&#xD;
his grandson was left, for he only became aware of his&#xD;
existence after his son lost his reason.&#xD;
".Supposing he could be found," asked the barris-&#xD;
ter, " would it benefit your son's condition I"&#xD;
"If lie could be made to understand that it was&#xD;
his child I believe it might," answered his highness.&#xD;
" Then 1 will fetch him," said the barrister, depart-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
When Sheldon heard the circumstances of his&#xD;
early infancy he was inclined to refuse an acquain-&#xD;
tance with his grandfather ; but anxiety on account&#xD;
of his unhappy parent led him to consent to an inter-&#xD;
-view. Upon reaching the gate, lie saw for the first&#xD;
time that peculiar coat of arms which his foster..'&#xD;
mother had attempted to describe to him from&#xD;
&#xD;
lIn&#xD;
&#xD;
memory, and had no longer any doubt as to his lin-&#xD;
c age.&#xD;
Such a meeting as this was to be-so humbling on&#xD;
one side, so exciting on both-did not take place&#xD;
without a feeling of reluctance. But the duke, once&#xD;
persuaded to get over the matter in the only way left,&#xD;
quickly decided to do it handsomely, and received&#xD;
his grandson with much kindness, asking him with&#xD;
apparent emotion if he were willing to receive for a&#xD;
father a hopeless lunatic. Sheldon answered that lie&#xD;
would be glad to own a lawful father, in any condi-&#xD;
tion, it having been the aim of his life to find such&#xD;
a person, and if it pleased his highness, he would be&#xD;
glad to see him immediately.&#xD;
Without further conversation, the duke repaired&#xD;
with his grandson to the apartments assigned the&#xD;
insane man. What a piteous spectacle ! The poor&#xD;
worn victim of mental delusion ceaselessly wearying&#xD;
himself by assuring a marble figure of a woman&#xD;
which he mistook for his lost wife, that lie was just&#xD;
going to fetch her boy if she would only be com-&#xD;
forted. Over and over lie made the same promise to&#xD;
the marble, and tenderly kissed and caressed it. If&#xD;
Sheldon had entertained feelings of bitterness toward&#xD;
his father for making him an outcast, lhe was amply&#xD;
avenged in beholding this sight of sorrow. He could&#xD;
not restrain his tears. The sight of the young man&#xD;
weeping arrested the madman's notice. He looked&#xD;
sharply at him for two or three minutes, then began&#xD;
to mutter to himself " the boy looks like his mother,"&#xD;
-which was true. This faint dawn of reason gave the&#xD;
duke some hope that, by visiting his father daily,&#xD;

Sheldon might possibly bring him back to possession&#xD;
of his intellect in the course of time; an opinion in&#xD;
which his physician coincided. But the visits&#xD;
which were made, although they seemed to restore a&#xD;
degree of reason, made the patient more ill, and&#xD;
finally occasioned a sudden fainting fit, from which&#xD;
he was only recovered to die. The recognition this&#xD;
time was complete, inasmuch as Sheldon called him&#xD;
by the name of ~ and he replied "my son."&#xD;
Nature was exhausted by the effort. It was some&#xD;
consolation to the duke that he had, in his one short&#xD;
glimpse of reason, beheld his son. Sheldon felt this&#xD;
sad event keenly for a ~short time, and fully forgave&#xD;
whatever injury he had sustained by his father's for-&#xD;
mer cruelty.&#xD;
The duke would now willingly have acknowledged&#xD;
his grandson and heir, but Sheldon resolutely de-&#xD;
clined. The most he would accept of service from&#xD;
his grandfather was the settlement of a small portion&#xD;
of his proper fortune upon himself, with which he&#xD;
meant to make comfortable the declining years of&#xD;
that excellent foster-mother who had been friends,&#xD;
fortune and family to him. But beside this, the&#xD;
duke had privately made over a handsome compen-&#xD;
sation to her for her pecuniary, expenditures on&#xD;
account of his grandson, and Sheldon found himself,&#xD;
in spite of his independent disposition, obliged to his&#xD;
grandfather for a comfortable fortune.&#xD;

America,~ and as full of contempt for the fictitious&#xD;
refinements of English aristocracy ~as Allen hiins~lf,&#xD;

Marion Wallace Cunningham and Annie Stewart&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        243&#xD;
&#xD;
was repeated, and a plan made by which they could&#xD;
be sent to the United States on the return of Shel-&#xD;
don, who still retained his name of Brown-prefer-&#xD;
ring its homely and plebeian sound to the more dis-&#xD;
tinguished but not more honorable one of his grand-&#xD;
father. Brown would have to wait some little time;&#xD;
but this lie consented to, being able, he said, to&#xD;
appreciate the condition of Miss Cunningham, having&#xD;
learned what acts great men may commit without&#xD;
jeopardizing their reputations. "The old duke&#xD;
thinks," said lie, that I am a strange fellow not to&#xD;
want to remain in England and wear a title and&#xD;
enjoy the privileges of the aristocracy. But I&#xD;
thought it would be refreshing to him to see a little&#xD;
independence for once; beside, it suited me better to&#xD;
return. The duke thinks our people as eager after&#xD;
such privileges as themselves, whenever we get any&#xD;
chance at all. However that may be with others, I&#xD;
am a republican and a democrat, and never shall&#xD;
"my lord" my fellow men, nor kneel to one of them&#xD;
wearing a golden crown."&#xD;
"It's a melancholy fact, I suspect," answered Allen,&#xD;
"that too many of our citizens, our ladies in particu-&#xD;
lar, are taken with the sound of a title, and delighted&#xD;
to make the acquaintance of a lord, no matter how&#xD;
depraved in character or dissipated in habits. The&#xD;
letters of all our travelling Americans are sure to&#xD;
report how often they have dined with an earl or a&#xD;
duke, or have been politely noticed by a count or&#xD;
have obtained a look at the royal family, or any&#xD;
other equally nonsensical thing, which blows their&#xD;
contact with the aristocracy of England"&#xD;

THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL*&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am sorry to believe jt," said Brown, "for it&#xD;
takes away the glory of our free and independent&#xD;
principles to see this abject spirit exhibited. Ameri-&#xD;
cans know that it' is no credit to a lord to be a lord,&#xD;
and that the wealth of the aristocracy is the wicked&#xD;
gain of oppression and monQpoly; therefore, they&#xD;
ought to exhibit the same pride in being indifferent&#xD;
to it that they did formerly in going out from it and&#xD;
setting up a government on different principles. The&#xD;
duke, whom I am obliged to own as my grandfather,&#xD;
though he is an aristocrat, reminded me of the same&#xD;
thing in a conversation not long ago, when, stung by&#xD;
my rejection of a title, he said I was more tlic,,n,&#xD;
American, for there was no lack of them to ape&#xD;
everything English which was in their power to imi-&#xD;
tate. 'Your ladies,' said lie, 'out-dress the Mar-&#xD;
chioness of Ely or the Duchess of Sutherland, and, if&#xD;
it were possible, would have more diamonds than the&#xD;
queen. If one of our ladies condescends to notice&#xD;
them, they arc more delighted than they dare ex-&#xD;
press, except by their faces, which do often betray&#xD;
them.' I confess I was somewhat ruffled by this sort&#xD;
of talk, and, would have liked to have defended&#xD;
A merican ladies, but felt that it was of no use. I&#xD;
could never convince obstinate self-esteem and arro-&#xD;
gance on one hand, nor prevent foolish exhibitions&#xD;
of vanity on tile other."&#xD;
"The most provoking thing about the English,"&#xD;
remarked Allen, "is the way they speak of the war&#xD;
of the Revolution. 'You fancy you have done a&#xD;
great thing,' they say, 'but it was no such great thing&#xD;
after all, for if we had been pleased to do so and so,&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
245&#xD;
&#xD;
it would have resulted differently.' Now, aside from&#xD;
that enormous assertion, I am more vexed with their&#xD;
seeming to think the one fact of asserting and main-&#xD;
taining our independence is all we ever have done,&#xD;
whereas we are a mighty and cultivated nation.&#xD;
Not so selfishly and individually refined as the Eng-&#xD;
lish aristocracy, perhaps, but universally and emi-&#xD;
nently intelligent, energetic, prosperous-not having&#xD;
as many poor and destItute in the whole length and&#xD;
breadth of our land as are to be found in the city of&#xD;
London, right under the noses of parliament and the&#xD;
queen."&#xD;
"I took the liberty," said Brown, "of asking the&#xD;
duke what it was which made the English ladies so&#xD;
8I~perior to our ladies that there could be any conde-&#xD;
ecencion in noticing them. I had observed that they&#xD;
could drink inure ~vine, play more games, and know&#xD;
more about fast horses than Americans of their sex;&#xD;
but these were not accomplishments which, in the&#xD;
estimation of a large portion of the world, entitled&#xD;
any one, least of all, a lady, to be thought superior.&#xD;
As for the more strictly womanly graces, I thought&#xD;
our ladies compared with any in tile world. And as&#xD;
for courage and devotion, the early history of the&#xD;
United States testified to that. 'They have some&#xD;
English blood,' put in the duke. 'Improved by&#xD;
crossing,' I suggested; and so we quarrelled about&#xD;
what was, after all, nothing to quarrel about. We&#xD;
can bear their insolence, and they will have to bear&#xD;
our independence and naivet~."&#xD;
"If, when we fought the English, we had been&#xD;
fighting for balance of po~ver, instead of hearthstones&#xD;

and manly rights," said Allen, "they might have&#xD;
beaten us, for they are savage lighters and had the&#xD;
numbers to do it with. Or did the, sentiments they&#xD;
recommend to us now, come from sincere and honest&#xD;
minds, we might very properly consider them. But&#xD;
they ~vill have to abolish white slavery before they&#xD;
prove to us the sin of black bondage; and they will&#xD;
have to be more liberal and more virtuous, before&#xD;
they can teach freedom and virtue to us. Why, the&#xD;
lowest Irish beggar has more humanity than these&#xD;
aristocrats. Not one of the poorest class would have&#xD;
abandoned a child in the way you were abandoned,&#xD;
but would rather have taken it on his back and&#xD;
begged something for its support."&#xD;
The young men finally decided that ~s Brown&#xD;
xvould remain until Miss Cunningham could return&#xD;
to America with him, lie should take an excursion in&#xD;
Ireland. In order to make this excursion as profit-&#xD;
able as possible to the cause adopted by Allen, it was~&#xD;
proposed that Brown should procure letters from the&#xD;
duke to the authorities of Dublin, asking permission&#xD;
to visit the prison and communicate with one of the&#xD;
prisoners. Allen knew that lie might be recognized&#xD;
by some one on the look-out for such an attempt, and&#xD;
that Brown would have a much better chance of suc-&#xD;
cess, especially if lie caine provided with credentials&#xD;
from the duke, which he was confident of getting.&#xD;
But Brown found that it was no mere amusement&#xD;
to fulfill the task that he had undertaken, of defeating&#xD;
the cunning and malice of a coyetous aristocracy.&#xD;
Those who play at the game are in power; and it is&#xD;
foolishness to struggle against the united authority of&#xD;

OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.       247&#xD;
&#xD;
Church and State. Those who take refuge behind it&#xD;
are entirely unapproachable. The man who is dis-&#xD;
gusted with politics is zealous in religious matters;&#xD;
but, as this religion is only an appendix to the poli-&#xD;
tical policy of England, it is used as a scraper to take&#xD;
up all that is left of that system.&#xD;
Sheldon Brown, however', went to Ireland full of&#xD;
sympathy for the oppressed, and full of confidence in&#xD;
being able to do something for their relief, in one or&#xD;
more particular instances, enjoying in anticipation&#xD;
the pleasure he was about to bestow. With a letter&#xD;
from the duke to the authorities of Dublin, Sheldon&#xD;
could see no reason why he should not accomplish&#xD;
all lie had undertaken. As far as securing their per-&#xD;
mission to visit and converse with any of the prisoners&#xD;
was concerned, so far he was successful. But when&#xD;
lie cams to ask the keeper to be shown the prisoner,&#xD;
John Woods, he met with a coniplete failure. "Och,&#xD;
lie is dead shure, God rest his soul !"&#xD;
"Dead !" echoed Brown.&#xD;
"Upon me soul, lie's dead," repeated the man, but&#xD;
in a manner that failed to carry conviction of the&#xD;
truth of w~iat lie said.&#xD;
"Very well," answered Brown; "I did not doubt&#xD;
your word. When did he die, and of what disease,&#xD;
and where are his remains ?"&#xD;
The man was confused by some secret conscious-&#xD;
ness, and only repeated:&#xD;
"lie's dead, mister, and shure I've not said any-&#xD;
thing to the contrary."&#xD;
"Very well, I say again," cried Brown, a little&#xD;
tartly; "I only asked you to inform me when he&#xD;

&#xD;
died, and where his remains were put. If you hesi-&#xD;
tate in telling me, I shall have you arrested."&#xD;
But the keeper evidently was not able to frame a&#xD;
plausible answer on the instant, and Brown ~vent for&#xD;
an officer to assist his memory. At the appearance&#xD;
of this individual, the frightened keeper, with the&#xD;
help of another one of the keepers, contrived to stam-&#xD;
mer out that some men from the north of Ireland had&#xD;
come and taken Woods away. He thought these&#xD;
men belonged to the little people (fairies), and he had&#xD;
heard afterward that the prisoner had died.&#xD;
"Did he die here or away ?" asked Brown.&#xD;
"He died here, shure. How would I know he was&#xD;
dead ?" answered the blunderhead.&#xD;
"What doctor did he have? Go and fetch him&#xD;
that I may ask him some questions."&#xD;
The man, WhO, under the eye of an officer, dared&#xD;
not disobey~ went for the physician, and soon re-&#xD;
turned with one, who repeated very clearly the par-&#xD;
ticulars of the case; still, in a manner, as if lie had&#xD;
prepared his answers beforehand, and without con-&#xD;
vincing his questioner that he told the truth. He&#xD;
repeated the assertion, that the body had been taken&#xD;
north by some persons who professed to be friends of&#xD;
the deceased. Brown assured him the case would be&#xD;
investigated. The physician then suggested that, pos-&#xD;
sibly, he might have been taken away for dissection;&#xD;
a hint which the keeper caught at to relate some cor-&#xD;
responding circumstTauces.&#xD;
This was Brown's success, over 'which he felt not&#xD;
only mortified, but det~ply disappointed. Being of a&#xD;
resolute temper, however, he determined upon going&#xD;
&#xD;
to the north of Ireland, to see Mr. Woods, John's&#xD;
father, and if possible get him to set an investigation&#xD;
on foot. Accordingly, lie wrote to Allen to meet him&#xD;
at a particular point, as early as possible, as he&#xD;
wanted his company, and should esteem him a guest&#xD;
on the journey,'for whose expenses he was responsi-&#xD;
ble. More discouraged than lie would have liked to&#xD;
own, he set out, through Mullingar, Longford, and&#xD;
Enniskillen to iRusnafasnia. At Enniskillen he pro-&#xD;
posed to await Allen's arrival. Here, he found he&#xD;
was in time for the assizes, which were then in ses-&#xD;
sion, and was glad to amuse himself at an Irish trial.&#xD;
Chancing to look over the clerk's docket, he dis-&#xD;
coVered, to his great amazement, the name of M. W.&#xD;
Cunningham, against her mother, Lady Fredonia, for&#xD;
the recovery of her father's estate. Here, then, was a&#xD;
new feature of the case, coming out unexpectedly.&#xD;
He wondered if Allen was advised of it. He set him-&#xD;
self to work immediately, to get acquainted with Miss&#xD;
Cunningham's attorney, who, he found, was a Mr.&#xD;
George McMean, a Scotch gentleman of considerable&#xD;
ability. From him, he learned that Miss Cunning-&#xD;
ham had been urged by the captain, and some&#xD;
other Scotch friends, to undertake the procuring of&#xD;
her legal rights. They had promised to stand by her&#xD;
and assist her all it was possible. She was herself weary&#xD;
of dodging and hiding, like a fugitive from justice,&#xD;
and felt that she dishonored her father's name by such&#xD;
a course. if there was any protection in the laws of&#xD;
her country, she would have it; if there was none,&#xD;
upon trial, she would be iio worse off than for-&#xD;
merly, except, indeed, losing the chance of ever get-&#xD;

ting her property in future, in case the decision&#xD;
should go against her. It was an important step to&#xD;
take, but she had decided upon it. Under these cir-&#xD;
cuinstances, Brown shrunk from having' her know of&#xD;
his efforts in Dublin, and their result. He saw that,&#xD;
whatever courage she bad would be needed in 'the&#xD;
coming trial. Therefore, upon being introduced to&#xD;
her by her attorney, he said nothing about his inter-&#xD;
est in her affairs; but confessed he was acquainted&#xD;
with them, through Mr. B. F. Allen; and also re-&#xD;
lated some portion of his own history, to divert her&#xD;
mind from its embarrassii~ents. But in this inter-&#xD;
view, Brown became persuaded that Miss Cunning-&#xD;
ham did not lack the fortitude necessary to bear~ up&#xD;
under great disappointments, and was pleased to find&#xD;
it so, knowing that there were some severe trials of&#xD;
patience in store for her.&#xD;
He informed Miss Cunningham that he had been&#xD;
delegated to escort herself and Annie Stewart, to&#xD;
America, if she desired to go, as her friend, Mr.&#xD;
Allen, had concluded to remain longer in Great&#xD;
Britain. They talked over Allen's adventures in&#xD;
Ireland, and the singular discovery of Annie Stewart.&#xD;
Miss Cunningham acknowledged that she had rather&#xD;
believed in haunted castles, until the serious and&#xD;
practical turn of Allen's ghost-hunting had destroyed&#xD;
the illusion, and converted those places into some-&#xD;
thing more fearful than haunted castles. This had&#xD;
ruined many a fine romance for her, and made her&#xD;
more afraid of tAem than ever before when she be-&#xD;
lieved in ghosts.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
ALLEN arrived at Enniskillen two or three days&#xD;
after his friend, and was greatly surprised to find Miss&#xD;
Cunningham in that place, and still more surprised to&#xD;
learn her errand. She was rejoiced to see him, and&#xD;
introduced him to Mr. MeMean, which gentleman&#xD;
assured him he could see no reason why Marion&#xD;
should not recover her property. He promised to&#xD;
make every exertion in the case, and if he was suc-&#xD;
cessful should be happy to feel that she was at least&#xD;
removed above the dangers or annoyances of poverty.&#xD;
As Allen had just arrived from England, Marion&#xD;
had no questions to ask about Woods, and Allen&#xD;
thought best not to undeceive her at present. If she&#xD;
could still have hopes of her lover's freedom and&#xD;
restoration to her, it was better for the present.&#xD;
The trial of Miss Cunr~iiigham's cause came on&#xD;
shortly. Every witness that could benefit Marion&#xD;
was snbpienaed. Dr. Wilkins came, looking abso-&#xD;
lutel~ ferocious with anxiety. It was the first inti-&#xD;
mation of Marion~s existence which he had received&#xD;
in several years, and in his joy, and in his fear, he&#xD;
left nothing undone he could think of for her benefit,&#xD;
in preparation for the trial. His gratitude to Allen&#xD;
was as earnest as if Marion had been his own child;&#xD;
and he laughed not a little, besides, at the relation of&#xD;
his jugglery on shipboard. A character that com-&#xD;
bined humor and ability with humanity, was the doc~&#xD;

tors ideal of a man. His friendship for Allen was&#xD;
secured for life.&#xD;
To the report given him of Brown's fruitless efforts&#xD;
in Dublin, to learn the fate of John Woods, the doe-&#xD;
toi' listened with contracted brows, and broke forth&#xD;
frequently with as many oaths as he used to fling at&#xD;
the heads of the beggars he always helped. He&#xD;
assured Allen that it was all a scheme to get rid of&#xD;
Woods, and that lie was probably removed to some&#xD;
private prison, where there could be no present hope&#xD;
of finding him. "If St. Patrick had tumbled down&#xD;
all the infernal old castellated dens on this island, he&#xD;
would have done better than to banish the snakes&#xD;
and toads," said the doctor, emphatically.&#xD;
At the trial were present Bishop Fredonia and his&#xD;
youngest daughter, and Bishop Stedman and lady,&#xD;
and the old Lord Elia, and Lord Brumson, beside a&#xD;
train of others of this class of persons. There, too,&#xD;
was a crowd of the old tenants, anxious for a glimpse&#xD;
of their young lady, whom many regarded as dead.&#xD;
Nor was General Arsdell absent. Just returned from&#xD;
a long journey in and from America, he had arrived&#xD;
in time to find the object of some anxious search at&#xD;
home. But Didy Fredonia was not there. When&#xD;
the clerk called the nam~s of the parties in the trial,&#xD;
Bishop Fredonia answered for her ladyship. This&#xD;
was a great disappointment both to Marion and her&#xD;
attorney, who wished to make Lady Fredonia iden-&#xD;
tify her daughter.&#xD;
The jury being called and sworn, the judge took&#xD;
his seat with all the ~;ir of dignity a ruler of a world&#xD;
might wear. The witnesses for Miss Cunningham&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.       253&#xD;
were called and sworn. Most of them were poor&#xD;
persons, tenants on the Cunningham estate-a fact&#xD;
decidedly unfavorable to Marion's success. The case&#xD;
was opened by Mr. McMean with ability, displaying&#xD;
a talent that should have commanded respect. It&#xD;
was first proven by seemingly competent witnesses&#xD;
that the plaintiff was Marion Wallace Cunningham,&#xD;
daughter of Lord Charles Cunningham and that as&#xD;
such, being of age, she claimedhis real and personal&#xD;
property. Among the spectators there was consider-&#xD;
able sensation; but the court scarcely gave its notice&#xD;
to the hearing of the testimony: it was more agree-&#xD;
ably engaged observing the crowd of gentle people&#xD;
present. There was, indeed, a very general represen-&#xD;
tation of the gentry from all the country round. So&#xD;
outrageous was it considered that the lord's servant&#xD;
should be molested in this way, and compelled to&#xD;
come to trial by a renegade girl, who had been all&#xD;
over the world, doing what nobody knew, and living&#xD;
nobody knew where. The contemptuous looks cast&#xD;
in her direction would have made many a woman&#xD;
quail, but Marion knew their worth. Her friends&#xD;
were alarmed for her cause with reason, when they&#xD;
observed the indifference of judge and jury to her&#xD;
evidence. But the apathy quickly disappeared when&#xD;
the bishop's witnesses began to testify. It was sought&#xD;
to be proven that Miss Cunningham was dead. One&#xD;
witness swore that seven years ago he discovered Miss&#xD;
Cunningham sitting by the roadside very ill, and in&#xD;
a very destitute condition; and that he took her to&#xD;
his house, where she soon after died. His testimony,&#xD;
however, had but little connection with the rest; yet&#xD;

&#xD;
it was not questioned. Two ladies, one a daughter of&#xD;
Mr. Hamilton, and the other the youngest daughter&#xD;
of Bishop Fredonia, took oath that the plaintiff was&#xD;
not Marion Wallace Cunningham. Every word these&#xD;
ladies said was eagerly listened to by the court, and&#xD;
had they been inspired they could not have com-&#xD;
manded more attention. This, after the careless way&#xD;
the plaintiffs evidence ~was heard, exasperated her&#xD;
party to the utmost. The outrageous swearing of the&#xD;
defence aroused the indignation of the honest poor on&#xD;
the Cunningham estate, who longed to see Marion&#xD;
restored to her rights; and when they were called to&#xD;
the witness stand a second time, they made their evi-&#xD;
dence very explicit and positive. For this, some of&#xD;
the most intelligent were accused of false swearing,&#xD;
for which crime transportation is the punishment.&#xD;
Poor Marion's friends were assailed on all sides.&#xD;
Efforts were made to intimidate her witnesses, and to&#xD;
sneer down herself; but to all this Marion remained&#xD;
quietly imidiffi~rent. She was sorry for her attorney,&#xD;
who had acted nobly, and now seemed sure to fail.&#xD;
She was indignant, too, at the villainy of her enemies,&#xD;
l)ut she knew that it was best to suppress all cxlii-&#xD;
bition of feeling on that score. Dr. Wilkins was the&#xD;
last witness examined, and then the case went to the&#xD;
jury.&#xD;
The judge charged the jury with great solemnity&#xD;
and dignity. had he been a Mansfield he could not&#xD;
have had more majesty. Sitting there, with the robes&#xD;
of office upon his shoulders, with Justice and Wisdom&#xD;
behind him, he might have defied the iniquity of the&#xD;
world. Yes, truly, lie had justice always behind him.&#xD;
&#xD;
He talked eloquently of the Rod of Equity and the&#xD;
Sword of Justice and Mercy. But these things are no-&#xD;
where found in Great Bridami, except in the old Lon-&#xD;
don Tower, among the items of good Queen Bess'&#xD;
Armory-room. There they are and will remain. The&#xD;
jury are instructed to decide thus or thus, if things are&#xD;
s'~ and so. And the foreman of the jury, all affability&#xD;
and bland smiles, informs his ~ionor they can give in&#xD;
the verdict without leaving their seats. The word is&#xD;
passed around to learn if all are prepared for the&#xD;
decision: but one old sturdy blacksmith, Christy&#xD;
Craig, gets up and jabbers away about the verdict in&#xD;
no very intelligible style, until lie is ordered to sit&#xD;
down by the judge. But the blacksmith reminded&#xD;
his honor that he was a juryman, and that the&#xD;
"Devil might take the likes of him, if he ever gave a&#xD;
verdict such as hAs fellow-jurymen talked of. The&#xD;
young lady was Lady Marion Cunningham, and there&#xD;
was no doubt of that."&#xD;
The judge ordered the jury to their room until they&#xD;
could agree; and a general indigiiation of the court&#xD;
fell upon the old blacksmith. This is one 6f the&#xD;
beauties of allowing a small proportion of the lower&#xD;
class to sit on a jury. They are nearly always over-&#xD;
ruled by the majority; who are of "gentler" birth.&#xD;
The farce is kept up, because it is the lower class who&#xD;
are judged, as a general thing. But, in this instance,&#xD;
they have a stubborn old fellow to coerce by argu-&#xD;
ment or threat. Christy Craig holds out in his deter-&#xD;
mination to believe in Miss Cunningham to the day&#xD;
of his death, and the announcement was finally made&#xD;
that the jury disagreed.&#xD;

256      THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL;&#xD;
That announcement was glad tidings to Marion and&#xD;
her friends, for it left her counsel honorably beaten,&#xD;
and herself with a chance for the future. Her&#xD;
greatest grief was on account of those witnesses who&#xD;
would be tried for false swearing, and their misfor-&#xD;
tune Was truly great. God only knew what they&#xD;
might have to suffer for her.&#xD;
Nothing remained now but to settle upon the best&#xD;
plan for Marion to pursue immediately. She still&#xD;
insisted upon making an effort through some one to&#xD;
communicate with Woods, and as the time of his im-&#xD;
prisonment was so nearly expired, to give him an&#xD;
intimation of her desire to have him come to America.&#xD;
This Allen promised to do in some way; at the same&#xD;
time giving it as his opinion that she had better re-&#xD;
turn to the United States at an early day, as Bishop&#xD;
Fredonia might find some new mode of persecution if&#xD;
she remained in his neighborhood.&#xD;
The report had reached Mai~ion that her mother&#xD;
had become insane, and this fact invested her lads-&#xD;
ship with a tender interest in Marion's eyes. It was&#xD;
easy to guess by what means her mind had been driven&#xD;
from its balance. It was sufficiently evident that&#xD;
Bishop Fredonia had not defended Lady Fredonia's&#xD;
case so strongly with no other motive than to please&#xD;
her ladyship. He and his were to enjoy the property&#xD;
which neither Marion nor she was permitted to con-&#xD;
trol. If her Inother was insane, cruelty had made&#xD;
her so: but this might not be true, and she might be&#xD;
another victim to a false imprisonment.&#xD;
There was nothing she could do to benefit her&#xD;
mother, however much she wished it, unless she re-&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.       257&#xD;
&#xD;
gained and contended for her rights, aud was suc-&#xD;
cessful; the latter possibility being nearly hopeless.&#xD;
Everything, even her mother, was in Bishop Fre-&#xD;
donia's power-a fearful and not unjust punishment&#xD;
on her ladyship for her former vanity and selfishness,&#xD;
not to say cruelty. The only conifort to be found in&#xD;
these facts was the hope that Lady Fredonia would not&#xD;
have opposed her daughter's suit if she had been able&#xD;
to have had a voice in the matter. In every shape&#xD;
the subject assumed there seemed little hope of&#xD;
Marion recovering her property during the lifetime of&#xD;
her mother.&#xD;
Allen was divided between his wish to stay, and his&#xD;
desire to be with Annie Stewart, for whom he had&#xD;
conceived a great fondness. General Arsdell said he&#xD;
was in love, but Allen denied it. He was deeply&#xD;
attached to her, and wished to oversee her education&#xD;
and her happiness in every way. By sending her&#xD;
home to his mother, who was old, he did not know&#xD;
but he might be inflicting a wearisome and unconge-&#xD;
nial life upon the tender young girl. Whatever his&#xD;
feelings wei~ toward his ward, he used great kindness&#xD;
ai~d discretion in her management, and it was with&#xD;
brotherly reluctance he consigned her to the care of&#xD;
his friend Brown to be taken away from him. The&#xD;
general and doctor laughed at his hesitation, and put&#xD;
in their protest against his entertaining the thought&#xD;
of returning to the United States, for a year at least;&#xD;
they proposed, instead, to make him, during that&#xD;
time, Marion's special agent in finding a husband.&#xD;
had Marion known of their bantering talk or known&#xD;
what was true, that in resolving to remain, Allen&#xD;

thought more of her than of his own wishes-she&#xD;
would have decided the matter for him by declining&#xD;
further service; but she knew really very little at the&#xD;
time of the wonderful efforts put forth by a fbw per-&#xD;
sons to unravel the tangled stein of her fortunes.&#xD;
As Annie was in Scotland, the party decided to go&#xD;
together to Glasgow, where they found hei', much&#xD;
unproved in health, and without the expression of&#xD;
apprehension and sadness which at first marked her&#xD;
countenan cc. The meeting between the young girl&#xD;
and her guardian was full of emotions not to be con-&#xD;
cealed. The tears flowed freely from the beautiful&#xD;
blue eyes of Annie, while they shone brightly in&#xD;
Allen's darker ones.&#xD;
Glasgow pleased our travellers by its contrast with&#xD;
the Irish towns, in the more independent look of the&#xD;
l)eople, and their better dress and shelter. Marion&#xD;
was amazed to see that l4ie girls who worked in the&#xD;
factories lived in fine six and eight story buildings;&#xD;
but the captain set her right about the benefit of such&#xD;
lodgings. "They might properly be called sepul-&#xD;
chres," he said, "and are more fit for tombs than&#xD;
dwellings." He promised to take his guests to see&#xD;
one of these buildings, in the morning after the opera-&#xD;
tives had gone to their Work. "We will make some&#xD;
excuse of wanting to look for lodgings, so as not to&#xD;
offend these people, who are proud if they are poor,&#xD;
and don't want strangers wandering through their&#xD;
halls and peering into their rooms. "How much can&#xD;
a Yankee endure ?" asked the captain laughing, "for,&#xD;
I assure you, the undertaking is not a trifling one, to&#xD;
go through one of these places."&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWo wORLDS.       259&#xD;
&#xD;
The party concluded that, whatever other human&#xD;
beings endured daily, or nightly rather, they should&#xD;
find no difficulty in encountering for a short time.&#xD;
The entrance was by a fine looking hall, from which&#xD;
stairs led to the second floor. In this hall were&#xD;
some paintings which Brown paused to admire, while&#xD;
Allen, who was more rapid in his movements, ran on&#xD;
up the winding stairs to look about. The captain&#xD;
laughed as he noticed the American's haste, and cau-&#xD;
tioned Marion not to go up until Allen returned with&#xD;
a report of the condition of the premises. "You&#xD;
perceive," said he, "that I put something in my&#xD;
mouth to guard against the effects of bad air," and&#xD;
he gave Brown and Marion some drug to taste for&#xD;
that purpose.&#xD;
After a few moments, telling them to wait for him,&#xD;
lie ran up the stairs, and met Allen at the top, in a&#xD;
fainting condition, and afflicted with terrible nausea.&#xD;
"You were in too munch of a hurry, my young friend;&#xD;
come, let me assist you down the stairs." While&#xD;
Allen was recovering himself below, the physicians&#xD;
came in on their morning round, and finding he had&#xD;
suffered a severe attack of nausea and vomiting, gave&#xD;
him some medicine upon the spot. But Allen was&#xD;
satisfied with sight-seeing in that place. Marion was&#xD;
ordered not to attempt it, and only Brown remained;&#xD;
whom the physicians took under their charge upon&#xD;
learning he was an American.&#xD;
Provided with a plate upon which a disinfecting&#xD;
drug was burning, he followed the doctors through&#xD;
their morning round. In spite of their precautions,&#xD;
the stench was awful. The air was perfectly putrid&#xD;
&#xD;

260-     THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL;&#xD;
with impurities of dirt and disease. How human&#xD;
beings ever lived in it, even for one week, was a mys-&#xD;
tery to Brown. In one small, close room was a sick&#xD;
mother with four poor, sickly, dirty children, that&#xD;
had not been ten feet away from their room for days&#xD;
together. All the filth of this family of little child-&#xD;
ren, with no one to attend to them, was confined in&#xD;
the same atmosphere they breathed, and obliged to&#xD;
be seen and smelt by the sick and helpless mother!&#xD;
In another room now empty, eight night-caps re-&#xD;
vealed how many lodged in that small place. There&#xD;
were bags containing small quantities of oatmeal, or&#xD;
part of a loaf of brown bread in the same room.&#xD;
Everywhere they went about the building the same&#xD;
unhealthy and disgusting spectacles met the eyes of&#xD;
the fastidious American.&#xD;
The physicians found seven of the sick that must&#xD;
be removed to the infirmary; three dying of con-&#xD;
siunption, to be buried at the public cost. Oh, ye&#xD;
that boast of England's pride and glory, behold the&#xD;
condition of these poor creatures and blush with&#xD;
shame! Their condition is infinitely worse than that&#xD;
of the poor Irish in open hovels, with a pig in one&#xD;
corner and a cow in the other, for cow or pig is&#xD;
refreshing, compared to the companionship of sick&#xD;
and dying human creatures. This condition of the&#xD;
poor is one reason why the Scotch laboring classes&#xD;
are not as numerous as the Irish.&#xD;
The Scotch are proud and keep up appearances&#xD;
while they are suffering horribly. Factory girls live&#xD;
in this way, always keeping a stone wall between&#xD;
them and the public, in preference to confessing their&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        261&#xD;
&#xD;
misery in the opeii air. From 80 to 100 are taken&#xD;
weekly to the infirmaries. One-third or sometimes&#xD;
one-half of this number recover. Had his friends&#xD;
wished it, the captain would have escorted them to&#xD;
the infirmary; but neither Allen nor Brown wished&#xD;
to see a more advanced chapter of this miserable&#xD;
story of human suffering. The very mention brought&#xD;
on a return of Allen's sickness, who whimsically&#xD;
declared that whereas the doctor's drugs had never&#xD;
been able to make him vomit, he could now produce&#xD;
that effect in himself at any moment by thinking of&#xD;
the Glasgow lodging house for factory operatives!&#xD;
It is a strange and shocking thought that people,&#xD;
with so much pride and public spirit, will allow their&#xD;
sons and daughters to be born, live, and die sur-&#xD;
rounded by such circumstances, yet make no effort&#xD;
to better their condition. Could they be made to&#xD;
realize the magnitude of the evil, perhaps they might&#xD;
be aroused to action; but the difficulty is in making&#xD;
them realize it. Use has made them satisfied. The&#xD;
doctrine that God makes the rich man rich, and the&#xD;
poor man poor, enslaves their faculties, and the peo-&#xD;
ple do not know that they might rise up and be~er&#xD;
their condition. The sort of teaching they get makes&#xD;
it something sacred to bear the sorrows of a blind&#xD;
Bartimeus, or a Mary Magdalene, because Christ&#xD;
sought out and salved such as these. This~is the con-&#xD;
solation of the sufferers; while the benevolence of&#xD;
the rich sets. theni aside for Christ to take care of,&#xD;
temporarily as well as spiritually. His sayings,&#xD;
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for they shall inherit&#xD;
the kingdom of Heaven 'p-" Blessed are they that&#xD;

fort to those from whom suffering cannot be averted,&#xD;
but as apologies for inflicting so~'rows upon the poor,&#xD;
in the charitable hope they may thereby secure the&#xD;
everlasting reward. God grant that they may!&#xD;
Allen, whose eyes were opened to perceive some&#xD;
of these perversions of Gospel teachings, compared&#xD;
them to an improvement made upon "Servants obey&#xD;
your masters," by a down-south preacher in the&#xD;
United States, who added to the original clause-&#xD;
"and don't steal your mistresses' chickens." But&#xD;
})reaching up Magdalenism is a more serious affair.&#xD;
Because Christ cast seven devils out of one such per-&#xD;
son and made her fit for society again, is no reason&#xD;
why others should be encouraged to go through the&#xD;
same experience to arrive at the same result. When&#xD;
such a principle is encouraged, as it is here, the&#xD;
IMiagdalenes are much superior in rank to the honest&#xD;
factory girls, because they are objects of special in-&#xD;
terest to all classes.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
TuE Americans were amused at a subject of discus-&#xD;
sion nmong the people of Glasgow, with reference to&#xD;
a new Free Church being built there by contribution.&#xD;
It appeared that some American slaveholders had&#xD;
visited the city, and contributed generously to the&#xD;
church-fund, as is their custom generally. But, upon&#xD;
mature reflection, tIme goo d people of Glasgow doubted&#xD;
the propriety of putting the product of slave labor&#xD;
into the house of God. Others, again, thought that,&#xD;
since the money had been accepted, it was too late to&#xD;
raise scruples about it, and objected to insulting the&#xD;
douor~ by sending it back. The discussion grew into&#xD;
excitement. Some persons went so far as to paint&#xD;
in red, on the front side of the church, "The Blood&#xD;
of Slaves !" This last appeal to the prejudices of the&#xD;
people produced infinite confusion among the church&#xD;
people.&#xD;
When the captain appealed to Allen and Brown,&#xD;
they said it came rather ungraciously from the&#xD;
mother country, who gave them the trade and per-&#xD;
severed in it herself so long as she held the colonies,&#xD;
to be now reproving them for it. For one hundred&#xD;
and forty years the infant nation was fed on the milk&#xD;
of African slavery, and it was too late now to think&#xD;
of weaning it. Besides, there could be no benefit&#xD;
derived from following English examples with regard&#xD;
to the negro. In the Indies the planters hold on to&#xD;

their lands until they are worthless, rather than allow&#xD;
a negro to become a landholder, while, in America,&#xD;
a free black man can accumulate property as well as&#xD;
a white man.&#xD;
Lord Benton, a friend of the captain's, was very&#xD;
indignant at this plain talk, and denied the truth of&#xD;
what had been stated with regard to British influence&#xD;
on the blacks; but the facts came home too thick and&#xD;
fast for him to withstand. The compensation free&#xD;
blacks receive in the British islands is such that they&#xD;
can never become anything but slaves ii~ reality;&#xD;
while the United States pays as much for good black&#xD;
labor as any other, and their relative standing in&#xD;
society is proportionally affected by it.&#xD;
"But I am not arguing for slavery," said Allen to&#xD;
his lordship; "I only want it understood that the&#xD;
subject has been misstated. The negro in America,&#xD;
even in a state of bondage, is not worse off than the&#xD;
laboring classes in England, Scotland and Ireland."&#xD;
"What! you do not mention the poor of Scotland&#xD;
in that connection? Why, they are better off than&#xD;
the same class anywhere else in the world," ex-&#xD;
claimed Lord Benton, angrily.&#xD;
"If they are, then God pity the rest!" put in Shel-&#xD;
don Brown. "I visited the abodes of your factory&#xD;
girls."&#xD;
"Oh, - the factory girls! What do you sup-&#xD;
pose we have to do with these people who come out&#xD;
of lanes and alleys? We have established infirma-&#xD;
ries and hospitals enough for this class; what else is&#xD;
there to do, if we provide them with medical atten-&#xD;
dance and a place to die decently in ?"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
OR, LWF~ IN TWO WORLDS.        265&#xD;
&#xD;
"You can take measures to prevent so many of&#xD;
them going to these places," answered Brown.&#xD;
"This is work for republicans to do. The English&#xD;
are contending for the general liberty of the world&#xD;
and the greatest good of mankind. Individual in-&#xD;
terests cannot be compared with national honors and&#xD;
national glory. The true Englishman feels that; but&#xD;
you, who have none of the noble blood of England&#xD;
in your veins, cannot properly appreciate the senti-&#xD;
meut, of ~&#xD;
"I do not know why 'of course,'" answered&#xD;
Brown, with some spirit. "If i[ could drain out&#xD;
what aristocratic blood there is in my veins, I would&#xD;
willingly part with it, and consider myself a better&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"What, are you not an American ?" asked his&#xD;
lordship.&#xD;
"Yes, as much so as sentiment and habit can make&#xD;
me, against the influence of the bad blood of the&#xD;
nobility of this country, which poisons my veins. I&#xD;
would give much to be a native American."&#xD;
Lord Benton talked a little more considerately of&#xD;
the condition of the poor, and named the benevolent&#xD;
institutions erected for their relief in Great Britain&#xD;
with greater respect, after learning that one of his&#xD;
auditors boasted noble blood, and scorned it, too.&#xD;
He spoke of a school provided for the education of&#xD;
servants as one means of benefiting the poor.&#xD;
"But why not extend that education, and make&#xD;
those who have talent fit for something better than&#xD;
service ?"&#xD;
"Because we do not wish to elevate these classes&#xD;

uiitil they aspire to mix with the nobility, which they&#xD;

"How are these schools for the training of servants&#xD;
supported ?"&#xD;
"By the government."&#xD;
"So you tax the poor to pay for educating them-&#xD;
selves for your service? That is a very convenient&#xD;
arrangement," remarked Brown, sarcastically. "Why&#xD;
do you not send us some of these educated servants ?"&#xD;
"We have use for those at home," replied his lord-&#xD;
ship.&#xD;
"But do none of these servants ever get promoted,&#xD;
or are they always kept in the same place in soci-&#xD;
ety ?"&#xD;
Lord Benton explained the degrees of promotion in&#xD;
servitude which males might enjoy; and that females&#xD;
do not aspire to any anything above the usual ad-&#xD;
vancement in the duties of the household, which is&#xD;
equal to their highest ambition.&#xD;
"Do you never think of the necessity of renewing&#xD;
the blood of the nobility by marriage with more&#xD;
common people ?" asked Sheldon. "Are you not&#xD;
afraid of the consequences of this constant intermar-&#xD;
riage? Every cattle-raiser understands the principle&#xD;
of breed-crossing, while the English aristocracy ever-&#xD;
lastingly marry ~&#xD;
"It would never do to intermarry with the com-&#xD;
moners. When once we do that, with all this liberty&#xD;
of speech and the press which we enjoy, the govern-&#xD;
ment of England would go to pieces directly."&#xD;
"And so it will have to, some day ;" said Sheldon,&#xD;
seriously. "There is too much hypocrisy and oppres-&#xD;

Gospel are shedding abroad in time world. The birth-&#xD;
right of all God's creatures will be restored to them&#xD;
in time, as the ceaseless struggles of nations against&#xD;
despotism, show conclusively.&#xD;
While Lord Benton and Sheldon Brown were walk&#xD;
ing and talking, Brown observed that he was watched&#xD;
by a person who seemed to wish to speak with him.&#xD;
Excusing himself he fell behind the party to give the&#xD;
man a chance to approach him.&#xD;
The man was evidently embarrassed, and hardly&#xD;
had confidence to improve the opportunity offered.&#xD;
Tie was peculiarly attractive in appearance, being&#xD;
tall, well-proportioned, and handsome; but his hag-&#xD;
gard eyes and extreme paleness, showed recent&#xD;
acquaintance with suffering. When lie addressed&#xD;
Brown he seemed overcome with diffidence, and for&#xD;
some time could not make his errand understood; a&#xD;
difficulty out of which the cool, off-hand manner of&#xD;
the young American in no wise helped him. But when&#xD;
Brown had heard his story, it was hard to refuse his&#xD;
request, which was, to be taken to America, with the&#xD;
promise on his part of paying his expenses back, if he&#xD;
lived to earn the money.&#xD;
It seemed, from his account of himself that he was&#xD;
the son of a Birmingham merchant, who was so unfor-&#xD;
tunate as to fail; for a failure in England is a misfor-&#xD;
tune from which men seldom if ever recover. Their&#xD;
only alternative is to take lodgings in a garret, from&#xD;
which they go either to the poor-house or church-&#xD;
yard-~or first to one, and then the other. At the&#xD;

&#xD;
THE ROMANCE OF AN I1~1SH GIRL&#xD;
&#xD;
time of Mr. Fleming's failure, his son was paying his&#xD;
addresses to a beautiful young lady, with a handsome&#xD;
income, and the marriage was talked of between the&#xD;
parents of the young people. But the disaster in Mr.&#xD;
Flerhing's business put it quite out of the question&#xD;
with the young lady's father, who instantly cut off&#xD;
the connection, and advertised his daughter as being&#xD;
worth so much property. This step, so significant,&#xD;
alarmed the lovers, and they very foolishly contrived&#xD;
to elude parental vigilance and elope. Young Flem-&#xD;
ing flattered himself that, by the aid of his wife's&#xD;
income and his own knowledge of business, he should&#xD;
be able to make a respectable living in trade, which&#xD;
very possibly he might have dome. But the enraged&#xD;
father brought his daughter home, and charged Flem-&#xD;
ing ~4ith abducting her; for which he was tried and&#xD;
sentenced to five years' imprisonment.&#xD;
Upon obtaining his liberty, at the expiration of&#xD;
that time, he learned that his wife, and a child he&#xD;
had never seen, were banished from the country; his&#xD;
wife to New York, his child he knew not where&#xD;
report said it had been placed in an asylum for illegiti-&#xD;
mate children, in Dublin, where the inmates had their&#xD;
name and unlawful birth branded upon their person.&#xD;
This precaution is used to keep pure the English&#xD;
blood, which abhors illegitimacy! Disaffected grand-&#xD;
parents, as in this case of Flenming's child, often dis-&#xD;
pose of children in this way; and the mark upon&#xD;
them prevents their recovering property by law.&#xD;
Poor Fleming had gone to Dublin without finding&#xD;
his child, and was now anxious to go to the United&#xD;
States. The account he gave, revealed to Sheldon a&#xD;
&#xD;
new phase of sin. Gracious God, when will thou&#xD;
condescend to stop the oppression of thy poor!&#xD;
Though Brown had no use for a ~ s services&#xD;
himself, he consented to help this person get to New&#xD;
York, and promised to find him employment, if pos-&#xD;
sible. The poor fellow was half wild with delight at&#xD;
the prospect; so he was set at work at once to get&#xD;
ready, lest in his joy he should really become insane.&#xD;
Our Americans found less true liberty and more&#xD;
real suffering in Scotland, than they expected to find.&#xD;
Consequently they left Glasgow with less regret than&#xD;
if this truth had not made itself evident to them.&#xD;
Allen had many directions to give Marion and Annie,&#xD;
about what to do, where to write to him, etc. The&#xD;
captain thought it occupied a great deal of his time&#xD;
to impress the recollection of these things on their&#xD;
minds! But the captain's ridicule had no efit to&#xD;
lessen his devotion to his young ward, who truly had&#xD;
become as the apple of his eye for preciousness.&#xD;
When Brown introduced Mr. Fleming to Allen,&#xD;
and gave him an outline of his history, Allen was&#xD;
confounded at the accumulation of evidence against&#xD;
the government and society of the country. Here&#xD;
were four persons in one party, all victims one way&#xD;
and another of the same instjtutions-the institutions&#xD;
of a nation that is said to have enjoyed liberty longer&#xD;
and more steadily than any other.&#xD;
" Oh," says a doctor of divinity, "time nation&#xD;
enjoys free speech, because 'Punch' ridicules Roy-&#xD;
alty at pleasure; and Bright and Cobden say Russia&#xD;
is right, and England wrong, with perfect impunity."&#xD;
Another evidence of freedom is, that a Russian agent&#xD;

270      THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL;&#xD;
at London daily telegraphs news to St. Petersburg!&#xD;
Immense condescension, truly! What can the nation&#xD;
do with the audacious "Punch," or with Bright and&#xD;
Cobden? She knows well enough ifiat her best&#xD;
policy is to let such men alone, because they arc&#xD;
dangerous antagonists when stirred up to speak their&#xD;
minds.&#xD;
But there was no more time for talking or thinking&#xD;
politics: everybody was ready, and the time to sail&#xD;
had arrived. Our party went on board very well&#xD;
satisfied with every arrangement except that of leav-&#xD;
ing Allen behind. The passengers came crowding on,&#xD;
the first bell rung-there were adicus and tears and&#xD;
hand-pressures. The second bell rung-Allen jumped&#xD;
ashore, and handkerchiefs waved to him from the&#xD;
steamer, while he stood benuinbed with a sudden&#xD;
sense of loneliness, almost of desolation. The steamer&#xD;
was already almost out of sight d own the river, when&#xD;
Allen was startled by a hand on his shoulder. Turn-&#xD;
ing, he saw his friend Hall, who had arrived just in&#xD;
time to miss the steamer. This was a pleasant meet-&#xD;
ing on both sides. Mr. Hall, with some other Ame-&#xD;
ricans, had been looking around in Scotland for a few&#xD;
days, and now, since they were left, concluded to&#xD;
continue their wanderings a little longer, inviting&#xD;
Allen to join them. This Allen consented to for a&#xD;
short time: but, as he had made up his mind what he&#xD;
should do in Ireland, he was anxious to be off.&#xD;
There is much similarity of manners between&#xD;
Scotchmen and Americans. They both have the&#xD;
same cordiality of manner with strangers, and the&#xD;
same willingness to learn all that may be inquired&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.          271&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
into concerning the personal history of a new ac-&#xD;
quaintance. Gould they make themselves readily&#xD;
understood, there would be a great deal of talking&#xD;
done when the two nations meet. Their themes of&#xD;
conversation having so many similar points, the inte-&#xD;
rest would seldom flag.&#xD;
Ben Lomond was the place selected for the ~rst&#xD;
pilgrimage of the new travelling party to which&#xD;
Allen found himself attached. Allen's friend, the&#xD;
captain, and other Glasgow gentlemen, urged theni&#xD;
to visit the spot where William Wallace was sleeping&#xD;
when John Montieth betrayed him into the hands of&#xD;
King Edward. This spot is one of peculiar interest&#xD;
and abhorrence to a Scotchman. He hates it, and con-&#xD;
siders it unholy ground, at the same time that he&#xD;
preserves the recollection of it most religiously.&#xD;
When they begin to talk of Wallace or Bruce their&#xD;
enthusiasm knows no bounds. Or when they talk of&#xD;
the nobility who were preferred to him, or of the&#xD;
man who betrayed him, their hatred cannot be de-&#xD;
scribed. To a person interested in displays of human&#xD;
feeling, the sudden transition from a love and admni-&#xD;
ration which brings tears to their eyes, to a settled&#xD;
hatred and gloom, occasioned by the mention of these&#xD;
different characters, would afford an exciting exhi-&#xD;
bition. It is a passage from ecstasy to despair, from&#xD;
love to desperation.&#xD;
But so much time was alicady spent that Allen&#xD;
felt like making short visits. Gen. Arsdell and Dr.&#xD;
Wilkins were trying to make some plan by which&#xD;
Allen could be introduced into society in Ireland.&#xD;
Could Lady Fredonia be seen by Allen they felt sure&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7665-00000137"/>&#xD;
272      TILE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL;&#xD;
he would be able to reinstate good feeling between&#xD;
herself and Marion. They had their own good&#xD;
reasons for not believing that her ladyship was&#xD;
insane. If Allen was well versed in the superstitious&#xD;
beliefs of the country he would have a powerful in-&#xD;
fluence to wield, together with his powers of ventri-&#xD;
loquism and mesmerism. A good ban8kee, made up&#xD;
of a frightful-looking little old woman, hired to&#xD;
warble melancholy ditties around the house, to warn&#xD;
the inmates of some coining calamity, might be ~nade&#xD;
to do good service in some instances for, though it is&#xD;
pretended such fairies are no longer believed in, and&#xD;
the Scotch and English who live in Ireland are&#xD;
ashamed to own their regard for them, almost every&#xD;
house that can afford it has its fairy. They are afraid&#xD;
to speak of them except as the "good people," and&#xD;
never touch an ant-hill.&#xD;
The general and doctor were not quite free from&#xD;
a little of this feeling, though they had the courage&#xD;
and sense to resist it. To resist superstition when&#xD;
surrounded by it requires constant watchfulness, and&#xD;
is more difficult than might at first appear. But,&#xD;
with or without their tendency to a national trait,&#xD;
they both were true Irish gentlemen-impulsive to a&#xD;
fault, because they have warm hearts, strong heads&#xD;
and great determination of character.&#xD;
At Ben Lomond the Americans were having very&#xD;
fine sport and getting laughed at by their Scotch&#xD;
friends for their bravery in attempting to explore the&#xD;
mountain without a guide, and tJieir want of success&#xD;
in the adventure. Believing in their instinctive&#xD;
knowledge of woods and wildernesses, and thinking&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN Two wORLDS.        273&#xD;
&#xD;
it would be very pleasant to spend a little time alone&#xD;
with God and Nature, without a stranger to listen to&#xD;
every chance word that might be dropped, they un-&#xD;
dertook the ascent in the morning of a very fine day.&#xD;
Entering on the west side of the mountain, they pur-&#xD;
sued a course toward the north, as that course kept&#xD;
them in the shelter of the woods; all the time con-&#xD;
gratulating themselves upon their sagacity, and think-&#xD;
ing it perfectly easy to retrace their steps. After&#xD;
climbing and walking until they were tired, they&#xD;
lunched and laid down to refresh themselves with&#xD;
sleep. Upon frwaking, they were at a loss about the&#xD;
time, as their watches were all left behind for fear of&#xD;
losing or breaking them in some chance tumble; and,&#xD;
as the sun was hid by the mountain, on the east side&#xD;
of which they now were, there was no way ofinform-&#xD;
ing themselves. They were surprised, however, to&#xD;
find it growing dark soon after they commenced to&#xD;
descend. On coming to a path, some of the party&#xD;
disputed the direction. In this manner they became&#xD;
sepai~ted, each going in the direction lie belh~ved the&#xD;
true one. Not one of them succeeded iii getting off&#xD;
the mountain that night. It was no great subject of&#xD;
regret, however, as each had an opportunity of be-&#xD;
holding the terror of Ben Lomond-its spirits of mist.&#xD;
Well might the superstitious or fanciful be overcome&#xD;
with awe at these vapory shapes. Now they are&#xD;
soldiers, dashing along and charging on other hosts.&#xD;
Now they are solemn shapes of gigantic proportions,&#xD;
stalking over the mountain to. some ghostly gather-&#xD;
ing; and now they are towering monuments. The&#xD;
situation of the tourists was any thing but pleasant,&#xD;

&#xD;
long before morning came to their relief, which at&#xD;
last it did, finding them thoroughly drenched with&#xD;
moisture, and pretty well fatigued. The sunrise&#xD;
looked doubly beautiful to them, as it was at once a&#xD;
glorious spectacle, and an indication to them on which&#xD;
side of the mountain they were. After some further&#xD;
blundering, the party got together once more, and&#xD;
were glad to meet some shepherds sent to bring them&#xD;
down from the mountain by their Scotch friends,&#xD;
who laughed well at their misadventure, but provided&#xD;
them with a warm fire and a good breakfast. Every&#xD;
effort was made to save them from the effects of the&#xD;
dew, which, if dried by the sun, it i~ believed, will&#xD;
produce sickness and probably death. They were&#xD;
made to drink freely of whisky, and toasted between&#xD;
blankets, which, after the fatigues ~f the last t~venty-&#xD;
four hours, was no disagreeable treatment, producing,&#xD;
as it did, eight hours of sound sleep. The innkeeper&#xD;
took a pride almost amounting to enthusiasm in the&#xD;
management of his patients, and truly he provided&#xD;
well for them.&#xD;
When they were once more ready for action, they&#xD;
found a large number of Scotch gathered in the inn&#xD;
to see and converse with the Americans, and to ask&#xD;
after relatives in the United States. Among these&#xD;
was a McDonald, a nephew of the McDonald who&#xD;
figured with general Marion in the Revolution. At&#xD;
first he was not very communicative, and watched&#xD;
with sarcastic eye the eager interest of the others.&#xD;
But when the Americans spoke of his uncle's merits&#xD;
he fired up immediately. The conversation became&#xD;
animated, and McDonald wept, prayed or swore&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
according as the manner or matter of the converse&#xD;
tion varied. No anecdote of either Marion or his&#xD;
uncle but was known to him. When asked if he&#xD;
had ever been in the United States, he said-" No,&#xD;
and I never shall be. I am going to stick to this&#xD;
Scottish soil, which so many are deserting and&#xD;
leaving to be run over by the English. if I cannot&#xD;
have liberty here, J will not have it anywhere. The&#xD;
true sons and daughters of Scotland will never desert&#xD;
her. If they go, who will rein am to strike off the&#xD;
tyrant's head when God gives the opportunity ?"&#xD;
"What," cried Hall, "you do not call the queen&#xD;
a tyrant? You pray for her every Sabbath in~ your&#xD;
churches, and ask God to bless her."&#xD;
"Yes, we do that; but a blessing in ay even-be a&#xD;
curse if the heart is not in it. If we say, 'God bless&#xD;
you,' meaning that 'I eaHnot,' the benediction can&#xD;
be of little worth, and this I assure you, is the way&#xD;
in which many of the queen's subjects pray for her.&#xD;
The people of Ireland and Scotland are not so stupid&#xD;
as to wish sincerely for the well-doing of a power&#xD;
that is crushing them so death, except in a few fa-&#xD;
vored cases. For myself I admit my insincerity and&#xD;
the bitter sarcasm of my heart when I join in the&#xD;
public prayers for the queen's welfare."&#xD;
Not so felt a Jumper, one of a sect of Welsh&#xD;
enthusiasts, who happened to be present; he blessed&#xD;
the queen sincerely, and remonstrated with the&#xD;
ungraceful Scotchman who would feel otherwise.&#xD;
The "Holy Jumpers," as they call themselves, found&#xD;
their practices upon the parts of Bible history which&#xD;
tells of David dancing before the Ark; and of the&#xD;

&#xD;
lame man that leaped and praised God. Upon this&#xD;
broad foundation they whirl and caper, until a pro-&#xD;
fuse perspiration takes place, when they believe the&#xD;
holy Spirit is upon them; and this constitutes the&#xD;
crisis of their enthusiasm, as well as the completion&#xD;
of their Christian duty "a religion less objection-&#xD;
able than many another," said McDonald. "~A mi-&#xD;
nister is excusable for preaching anything in itself&#xD;
harmless; but not for setting forth the tormenting&#xD;
doctrine that God ordains whatever England sees lit&#xD;
to order with regard to her outraged subjects."&#xD;
There was much feeling among the Scotch, appa&#xD;
gently, concerning the way in which the govern-&#xD;
ment provided for the poorer. classes; and much&#xD;
admiring sympathy expressed for the more liberal&#xD;
American spirit of government. It transpired in the&#xD;
course of conversation that Allen was going to Ire-&#xD;
land, when some one remarked that lie "had better&#xD;
look out, for every hedge was lined with pikes and&#xD;
blunderbusses." "An' it's yourself that's a liai',"&#xD;
muttered an Irishman who had mixed with the crowd&#xD;
unnoticed. "Bad luck to the mother's 50fl of them&#xD;
that lays his hand on an American. Troth, they'll&#xD;
give the best of their store, an' ye'11 be deserving of&#xD;
it sure."&#xD;
Allen slapped Pat affectionately on the shoulder,&#xD;
and promised to give the Irish a chance to show&#xD;
their good xviii, while secretly smiling at the recol-&#xD;
lection of his fp~mer reception in that notable island.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIIJ.&#xD;
Tm~ Americans found time pass very pleasantly at&#xD;
the little inn by Ben iLoinoiad. They were regaled&#xD;
with Scotch music in all its native charms and pecu-&#xD;
liarities. Their musicians confined themselves to the&#xD;
native poets chiefly, and treated the tourists to bal-&#xD;
lads in regular minstrel style. The frank manners,&#xD;
plain, cordial conversation, made these efforts tt&#xD;
entertainment very agreeable. The dignity of the&#xD;
musician was not lost when lie sang in noble strains&#xD;
of his beloved country, upon the very soil lie cele-&#xD;
brated. When, condescending to make inountebanks&#xD;
of themselves, some lazy fellows take to the streets&#xD;
of cities with their hand organs or bagpipes, degrad-&#xD;
ing the name they bear, it is then the "strolling&#xD;
musician" is a bore.&#xD;
Our party were about taking leave of Ben Loinond&#xD;
when the arrival of another set gave a different direc-&#xD;
tion to their thoughts. The new arrival were English&#xD;
gentlemen, on their way to St. Fillan's, at the foot of&#xD;
Loch Earn, where the Highlands Society hold the&#xD;
yearly celebration of their gaines. Allen was rather&#xD;
disconcerted on recognizing General Larubert among&#xD;
the Englishmen. He would rather not have met&#xD;
him, fearing th'~t~the events of the sea voyage might&#xD;
have lost their seriousness; and the old General&#xD;
might have some suspicions of the trick practiced on&#xD;
hi mu. But, fortunately, lie was altogether pleased to&#xD;

meet his young friend, whom he treated with great&#xD;
cordiality and insisted on taking to the games with&#xD;
him. Allen being unable to make an excuse with-&#xD;
out betraying some of his plans to the sharp old gen-&#xD;
eral, allowed himself to be persuaded, if the invita-&#xD;
tion was to be extended to the whole American&#xD;
party, which it was.&#xD;
On the way, the general inquired, with interest,&#xD;
about Miss Cunningham-denouncing the course pur-&#xD;
sued by her persecutors with unction; but Allen,&#xD;
though strongly tempted to confide the whole story&#xD;
to his friend, was uncertain of the wisdom of such a&#xD;
thought, and evaded saying much about Miss Cun-&#xD;
ningham, except that she had returned to the United&#xD;
States.&#xD;
To Allen, the spectacle he had come to witness was&#xD;
full of a strange kind of interest. It was a scene so&#xD;
unlike the every day, practical routine of amuse-&#xD;
ments common to the whole world, that lie was&#xD;
enchanted. It gave him, too, quite a vivid idea of&#xD;
Highland life and character, though he could not&#xD;
l)elp thinking it must be in its most alluring phase.&#xD;
The ground chosen for the games was spread with&#xD;
tents for the accommodation of the nobility of that&#xD;
region, and was quite surrounded by a concourse of&#xD;
strangers. The fine amphitheatrical hill rising back&#xD;
of the tents nearly four hundred feet, was covered&#xD;
over with the fresh looking Scotch women, and rosy&#xD;
lassies in tartans, and young men in hose and phili-&#xD;
begs. Truly it was a lively spectacle. The prizes&#xD;
announced were, for the best performance of the&#xD;
pibroch, a bagpipe, full mounted in silver with&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.       279&#xD;
inscriptions. The second prize for the same perfor-&#xD;
mamice was a splendidly mounted dirk-which, it was&#xD;
generally supposed, the winner felt like using on the&#xD;
winner of the bagpipe.&#xD;
The name of McMullen was shouted by the herald,&#xD;
and forth walked the Highland McMullen, in bonnet&#xD;
and plaid. The broad chequered sash that passed&#xD;
over his left shoulder was drawn down and tied&#xD;
under his right arm. His kilt of plaid, reaching to&#xD;
the knee, was richly belted and furnished with a&#xD;
pouch worn in front, and ornamented by two hand-&#xD;
some pistols and a dirk hanging from the belt. His&#xD;
well developed limbs were incased in striped hose,&#xD;
coining down into an elegant shoe fastened with a&#xD;
silver buckle. This picturesque looking personage&#xD;
began by performing a sort of lament, which it must&#xD;
be acknowledged, had an execrable sound to Ameri-&#xD;
can ears, and met with no particular enthusiasm&#xD;
except from the Scotch ; to which their native instru-&#xD;
mnent is a reminder of their youth, their homes, their.&#xD;
history and their heroes. To those, however, who&#xD;
have no national feeling connected with it, themusic&#xD;
is horridly monotonous. The very sight of the bag-&#xD;
pipe to a stranger, who sees in it only a huge wind-&#xD;
bag having four long awkward legs or pipes, is hidi-&#xD;
crous in the extreme. Mi'. Hall whispered to Allen&#xD;
that it was "strange what an immense amount of&#xD;
influence antiquity has in forming our Opinions."&#xD;
But McMullen's performance being at an end, he&#xD;
retired, and the second competitor came on with a&#xD;
very handsome bow to the ladies. Indeed, his bow-&#xD;
ing and smiling was the best of his effort; inasmuch&#xD;

&#xD;
as no one but a Scoteliman could have told his per-&#xD;
formance from the preceding one. The costume was&#xD;
very similar, the strut the same, and, for all any one&#xD;
could tell, the tune the same, also. Aspirants for honors&#xD;
continued to follow one another until tile patience of&#xD;
the strangers was exhausted; but the prizes were&#xD;
finally awarded, when McMullen took the bagpipe.&#xD;
Then caine the herald announcing that con&#xD;
for the prize for throwing the sledge-hammer would&#xD;
appear. At that cry tilere was a clearing away of a&#xD;
space, while several men, stripped for the contest,&#xD;
entered tile area. The 1)rizes for the feat of casting&#xD;
tile sledge were mere trifles; and when the sport&#xD;
commenced, Allen felt disposed to sneer at this boy's&#xD;
play. But when tile tall stalwart fellow who had&#xD;
the first throw, cast 1the hammer weighing twenty-&#xD;
two pounds to a distance of sixty feet, he began to&#xD;
look on with interest. After him came another who&#xD;
made a great effort, but fell short of the first one.&#xD;
Then came a slender, delicate-looking young man,&#xD;
rather appearing as if he had better be kept out of&#xD;
the crowd, which might run over him. Every one&#xD;
pitied him for making the attempt, while a general&#xD;
murmur of disapprobation greeted his appearance.&#xD;
He picked up the sledge very quietly and cast it two&#xD;
feet beyond the first mark~ This easy success aroused&#xD;
the hero of sixty feet, and, as lie had five throws, he&#xD;
insisted on outdoing the pitiful dwarf who had&#xD;
excelled him. His effort, however, was a failure, for&#xD;
he fell short of his first mark. Again the Ican, light,&#xD;
little fellow, who had distanced him, took up his sta-&#xD;
tion for another throw. Fixing his left foot slightly&#xD;
&#xD;
[&#xD;
&#xD;
ill advance of his right, lie clenched the ~sledge handle&#xD;
and fixing his eye on the distance as if he would&#xD;
annihilate it, drew himself up for the effort. All was&#xD;
intense excitement. "Aweel and he's a braw man,"&#xD;
ejaculated an old Scotchman beside Allen. "That's&#xD;
a fact !" responded the fascinated Yankee, never&#xD;
moving his eyes. Whiz! went tile twenty-two poun-&#xD;
der. "'Sixty four feet and eight inches !" was heard&#xD;
after a moment, and the throng gave one tremendous&#xD;
shout of applause. After this no one seemed inclined&#xD;
to try for the prize, which was awarded to the young&#xD;
victor.&#xD;
The next game was one in which an iron ball,&#xD;
weighing twenty-two pounds, like the hammer, is&#xD;
taken in the left hand and shoved forward, as it were,&#xD;
the hand not being drawn back as in throwing. The&#xD;
competitors for distinction in tilis game showed a vast&#xD;
amount of strength and skill. The second trial was&#xD;
made by a young nobleman, who, by concentrating&#xD;
all his power at the right moment, sent the ball&#xD;
thirty-six feet-the greatest distance ever gained. The&#xD;
price was considered his, it being only a silver-&#xD;
mounted snuff niull.&#xD;
Aften this, caine the tossing of the cabas.-a piece&#xD;
of wood eighteen feet long by six feet at one end and&#xD;
four at the other. The performer in this game raises&#xD;
the cumbersome thing to his shoulder, and with both&#xD;
hands under the smallest end, endeavors to cast it&#xD;
forward and make it turn a somerset. The act&#xD;
requires such immense exertion that a feeling of pain&#xD;
takes away from time pleasure of the spectators in&#xD;
beholding it. Only on&amp;amp;person succeeded in turning&#xD;

the cabas, and~he, everybody felt, must have suffered&#xD;
by it. however, his injuries whatever they were,&#xD;
were healed by receiving a silver brooch.&#xD;
Next in order was the shooting from guns, some&#xD;
hitting the target at seventy, some at eighty and&#xD;
others at a hundred yards. While this was going&#xD;
on, the ladies took luncheon. After luncheon, came&#xD;
the dancing. Four ladies took tIme stage and danced&#xD;
the highland reels, the successful bagpipes playing,&#xD;
and three other ladies being judges. The first prize&#xD;
was a I)air of silver buckles, the second a highland&#xD;
plaid. The (lancing really immerited this reward.&#xD;
Following the reels, was the sword dance, or Gille&#xD;
Calhim. Two claymores were laid upon the stage so&#xD;
that they crossed each other in the middle and lay&#xD;
at right angles. When these were arranged, a good-&#xD;
looking young highlander ascended to the stage, and&#xD;
touched his bonnet gracefully to his fair judges.&#xD;
Taking his' position to join the commencing bagpipe&#xD;
music, he passed once around the swords, pausing at&#xD;
their hilts and points, addressing to theni significant&#xD;
looks full of coquetry, as much as to say, "tIme ladies&#xD;
see us," and then began the dance. It would be very&#xD;
difficult to describe this performance. No spider's web&#xD;
was ever more intricately woven than the web of this&#xD;
sword dance. In and out, round and round, with&#xD;
crossings and curves innumerable and perplexing;&#xD;
the effort of the dancer being, to execute all with deli-&#xD;
cacy and grace, without once touching either of the&#xD;
claymores. Our young Highlander succeeded in the&#xD;
dancing to the admiration of all, but was so unfom&#xD;
tunate as to touch one of the swords.&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        283&#xD;
&#xD;
The exercise with swords, in which Joh1m McGregor&#xD;
made his sword sound five times on the breast of his&#xD;
antagonist, without hurting anything but his feelings,&#xD;
however, was the last exercise on the list. The last&#xD;
candidate for prizes was among the shepherds; the&#xD;
one who could bring the highest testimonials of char-&#xD;
acter for tIme longest time was declared the hero.&#xD;
This time it was an 01(1 man, whose credentials made&#xD;
hum out more faultless thami his neighbors, for forty&#xD;
years. The al)l)lause following this announced emit,&#xD;
was different fm'omn that which rewarded the other&#xD;
victors-not being manifested by shouts or cheers,&#xD;
but by the long approving gaze of the crowd after&#xD;
the venerable Christian.&#xD;
The throng now Separated this way and that; the&#xD;
ladies going home, the Society repairing to aim inn,&#xD;
where a grand dinner was prepared, with l)leIlt.y of&#xD;
good liquors. The American party were invited to&#xD;
join them. Allen was m~musecl in spite of his dislike&#xD;
to dinners of this sort. The toasts were good and free&#xD;
from party feeling, or bitterness of any kind. As the&#xD;
wine began to flow pretty freely, all restraint was at&#xD;
an end. A bumper was filled to the ladies, who had&#xD;
graced the occasion, which was drnnk standing upon&#xD;
chairs. The chief had one foot on the table and one on&#xD;
a chair, while he held 'up his glass and called for three&#xD;
cheers in Gaelic. This " opened the ball," and the&#xD;
effort seemed then to be who could make the most noise.&#xD;
The lairds laid aside their dignity, and sung Highland&#xD;
songs with spirit. Dancing ~~'as intro(hlced-whjchi,&#xD;
however, did not go off as well as if ladies had been&#xD;
their partners. It was proposed, at last, to go out and&#xD;

bring in the rustic lassies of the neighborhood to join&#xD;
them in a good country dance-a plan which was&#xD;
effected after some difficulty, from the hesitation on&#xD;
the part of the "bonnie lassies." Then everything&#xD;
went on famously. Lords forgot their titles, but&#xD;
girls did not forget their sweethearts. One&#xD;
country&#xD;
nobleman not being able to find a partner in the&#xD;
room, went to the kitchen and brought in the cook-&#xD;
a woman weighing about two hundred pounds, who&#xD;
danced as lightly as the best of them, very much to&#xD;
her partner's gratification. A Seotchman's dancing&#xD;
is characterized by the same energy and vivacity&#xD;
which distinguishes his actions otherwise, and is by&#xD;
no means an un(rraceful exhibition. But this merri-&#xD;
ment caine to an end, as all such rejoicing will.&#xD;
Allen still was thinking of his duties unfulfilled, wish-&#xD;
ing to know how to address himself to the accom-&#xD;
plishment of them.&#xD;
The morning after the festival he was idly watch-&#xD;
ing the changing cloud-shapes from a window of the&#xD;
inn, when his attention was attracted by hearing two&#xD;
Englishmen discussing the affairs of Bishop Fredonia,&#xD;
and expressing considerable sympathy, that a person&#xD;
in his station had been obliged to undergo the inortifi-&#xD;
catiomi of a trial by jury, while a member of the&#xD;
House of Lords. A provision made by Parliament&#xD;
that a peer, or peeress, either in her own right or by&#xD;
marriage, cannot be brought to answer to a civil&#xD;
charge, or be tried except before his peers or her&#xD;
peers, had not sufficed to protect the bishop from&#xD;
this indignity, because it was understood he had no&#xD;
noIle blood. He was not, really, on a footing with&#xD;
&#xD;
284&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
his wife, who was a peeress in her own right as well&#xD;
as by marriage, although lie was a bishop and a meni-&#xD;
her of the house of Lords. This was esteemed a&#xD;
great trial for the bishop's saintly humor, and it was&#xD;
feared it might hurt his influence with the Irish ,a&#xD;
tIming to be regretted, as he was a very thorough maim&#xD;
with the "rebellious" poor. The bishop was sincerely&#xD;
condoled with by these good churchmen and aristo-&#xD;
crats, and Miss Cunningham very much blamed for&#xD;
not bringing her case before the house of Peers. It&#xD;
is true that the peer is not required to give his ver-&#xD;
dict upon oath, like other men it being presumed&#xD;
that the nobility of his blood will compel him to truth&#xD;
and justice, not only in ordinary matters among his&#xD;
fellow peers, but in chancery cases. Miss Cunning-&#xD;
ham is in duty bound to consider the dignity of the&#xD;
Church, and the House of Lords. No matter if the&#xD;
bishop does sit by laying claim to some pretended&#xD;
barony, in which there is no more reality than there&#xD;
would be in pretending to noble blood!&#xD;
Allen learned, by the conversation he overheard,&#xD;
that the wife of Bishop Fredonia was insane, and&#xD;
~there was talk of having some one appointed to&#xD;
examine into her condition. The appointment of&#xD;
sin ii person or persons, as well as the appointment of&#xD;
s~mne one to have the care of her, is in the chancel-&#xD;
lor's power. The hearing of all this opened Allen's&#xD;
eyes to a new idea. What if the persons set apart&#xD;
for such offices should be picked men, in the power&#xD;
or confidence of the bishop! He fancied lie saw the&#xD;
trouble apprehended by the bishop; which was that&#xD;
Lady Fredonia should convince her examiners that&#xD;

&#xD;
she was perfectly sane, and lie thereby lose the con-&#xD;
trol of' her property.&#xD;
General Lainbert was another who had listened to&#xD;
this conversation: and as it furnished some connect-&#xD;
ing links with what he already knew, he questioned&#xD;
Allen to find out how much of this singular history&#xD;
was known to him. The opportunity for getting&#xD;
counsel was too good to be lost; and Allen confided&#xD;
his business connection with this history to his old&#xD;
friend, asking his advice. This was a fortunate stroke&#xD;
of policy, as General Lambert was able to put him on&#xD;
tIme right track at last. While General Arsdell and&#xD;
Dr. Wilkins were wearying their souls with conj cc-&#xD;
ture and impatience, afraid to do anything them-.&#xD;
selves for fear of making matters worse, since now&#xD;
that the trial was past, Marion's friends ~~ere well&#xD;
known-and wondering what had befallen our young&#xD;
American, he was coolly plotting for the subjugation&#xD;
of the foe with an old hand at strategy. But Allen&#xD;
did not undertake his mission without some mis-&#xD;
givings. He had already shed some blood on Irish&#xD;
soil, and did not know but lie might be called upon&#xD;
to shed yet more. His chances are better unencum-&#xD;
bered by the two ladies who were the cause of his&#xD;
former trouble, but his intentions this time are of such&#xD;
an audacious nature that it will be great generalship&#xD;
which takes him through in safety.&#xD;
Allen smiled as General Lanibert assured him he&#xD;
could not fail, but dared not, of course, reveal what&#xD;
lie might tell of former exploits in which the general&#xD;
was the victim. The Yankee adventurer had acquired&#xD;
considerable character since his first entrance of the&#xD;
&#xD;
steamer at Quebec. The scenes he had passed&#xD;
through, and the responsibility so unexpectedly&#xD;
devolving upon him a~ a result of his adventures,&#xD;
had sharpened his intellect and toughened his manly&#xD;
courage considerably.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
ALLEN bid adieu to his friends, English and Ameri-&#xD;
can, and returned to Glasgow, sailing from thence to&#xD;
Londonderry. Great is the interest which clings to&#xD;
the massive stone walls of Derry. These walls are&#xD;
sacred in the eyes of the true Protestant, as having&#xD;
stood between his religion and extermination for so&#xD;
long, at the memorable siege when James the Second&#xD;
and his French allies persecuted them with every&#xD;
form of horror. No instance of heroism recorded&#xD;
excels that of the miserable Protestants who died of&#xD;
starvation under these walls, rather than weaken the&#xD;
resources of the already famishing garrison by accept-&#xD;
ing a mouthful of their scanty food. And no instance&#xD;
of hellish cruelty exceeds that of the fiends who&#xD;
drove these poor wretches here in droves, compelling&#xD;
them to remain at the point of the bayonet as a trial&#xD;
and temptation to the besieged to make them surren-&#xD;
der. At Londonderry, above all other places in Ire-&#xD;
land, is Freemasonry cherished. To this institu-&#xD;
tion, under God, they attribute their deliverance.&#xD;
Although they do not associate together as an order,&#xD;
or make any display of their opinions, they are the&#xD;
most uncompromising of Masons. Masons alone, of&#xD;
all mankind, preach salvation with power to Deists&#xD;
and Atheists. They are the only people on the earth&#xD;
who have bruised the serpent's head.&#xD;
Allen, according to a hint from General Lambert,&#xD;
&#xD;
had introduced himself to this order, by whom be&#xD;
was met with every mark of regard; and who were&#xD;
bound to stand by him in any emergency. He was,&#xD;
already, a Royal Arch in the order, and had drank&#xD;
deep of the foundation of knowledge discovered by&#xD;
that holy brotherhood, and was therefore entitled to&#xD;
every distinction, lie was given a passport that in&#xD;
northern Ireland was better than an army with ban-&#xD;
ners, and from one of the brethren a letter to Bishop&#xD;
Fredonia's steward, who was also a Mason. The bishop&#xD;
was absent in England upon the business of trying to&#xD;
retain the entire control of Lady Fredonia, which, if&#xD;
he could do, would give him an immense advantage.&#xD;
There was a will which her ladyship had always&#xD;
managed to keep from the grasp of her second hus-&#xD;
band, and which he feared she might find an oppor-&#xD;
tunity of conveying to the administrators, notwith-&#xD;
standing her alleged insanity.&#xD;
In this state of affairs, Allen arrived at Cunning-&#xD;
ham Castle attended in a lordly manner by two negro&#xD;
boys, i Vam~ricaine, and, presenting his letter to&#xD;
the steward, he was handsomely received and made&#xD;
"at home." His servants were the wonder of the&#xD;
whole household and furnished infinite amusement to&#xD;
the servants of the bishop. The boys were not back-&#xD;
ward in making the most of their opportunity, and&#xD;
pretended to marvellous things, calculated to inspire&#xD;
respect in the mammon-worshipping menials of a&#xD;
mammon-worshipping lord. Indeed, Allen had&#xD;
picked them out of a travelling negro show for that&#xD;
special purpose, which they carried out to perfec-&#xD;
tion, and, if one might have judged of their master&#xD;
13&#xD;

&#xD;
by the display they made in attending him, he&#xD;
might have been the Grand Turk.&#xD;
Allen found the bishop's sfeward a very gentle-&#xD;
manly person, and judged that, of his own free will,&#xD;
he would have done an injury to no one; but those&#xD;
who serve in that country are hardly personally&#xD;
responsible for their actions. In America, where a&#xD;
man is "hired," and goes or stays at his pleasure, he&#xD;
may be supposed to exercise a conscience; but not so&#xD;
when the law makes him a servant, and where jus-&#xD;
tices of the peace bind him to service, sometimes&#xD;
without his own consent.&#xD;
In the bishop's family there was one member for&#xD;
whose acquaintance our adventurer was unprepared.&#xD;
This was the bishop's mistress, who ruled in the&#xD;
house with an absolute will. Of French origin and&#xD;
Italian birth, she combined in her character the sub-&#xD;
tilety and vices of both nations, being elegant in&#xD;
manner, accomplished in mind, and thoroughly cor-&#xD;
rupt at heart. Reverse of' fortune had brought hei'&#xD;
to England, where the bishop fell in with her and&#xD;
secured her instructions for his dan ghters, who then&#xD;
needed a governess. Since their marriage he had&#xD;
retained her for his own special consolation in the&#xD;
numerous trials which he encountered, and to look&#xD;
after the comfort of his poor demented lady! 11cr&#xD;
devotion to the bishop was unparalleled for a time;&#xD;
but, since his reputation and the prospect of his for-&#xD;
tune began to waver, she had shown some signs of&#xD;
being dissatisfied with her position. She understood&#xD;
too well the delicate hair by which these two were&#xD;
now suspended, to have nmch confidence in them;&#xD;
&#xD;
and felt that, unless she could extricate herself from&#xD;
her present connection, she should be involved in&#xD;
the ruin.&#xD;
Of all the persons about the house, Mile. N-.--&#xD;
was most impressed with the~ display made by the&#xD;
young American planter-as she had no doubt he&#xD;
was. His generosity, the attention his servants gave&#xD;
him, his good breeding and youth, made it a matter&#xD;
of anxiety to her to secure his good opinion. It was&#xD;
equally a point with him to become a favorite with&#xD;
her, and, to this result, he addressed himself, lie&#xD;
was much in her company, and gave her every flat-&#xD;
tering attention. His servants were exceedingly&#xD;
obsequious to her, as if reflecting the sentiments of&#xD;
their master, and Mile. N- was on the high road&#xD;
to a new conqnest apparently. She took great care&#xD;
to conceal from her admirer her former situation in&#xD;
the family, or her late relations with the bislmop-both&#xD;
of which, however, were made known to Allen&#xD;
through his friend, the steward. As a relative of the&#xD;
bishop, she assumed the charge of his household in the&#xD;
absence of Lady Fredonia, while she was suffering&#xD;
from mental "derangement."&#xD;
The game went on finely for a time; the French-&#xD;
woman soliloquizing somethimi g after this manner:&#xD;
"It is dine I was 4ettled in some way. TIme bishop&#xD;
is getting old, wrinkled and disagreeable, and may be&#xD;
poor, besides. Or, if he does not lose the estate, and&#xD;
if Lady Fredonia does die, there's no security that&#xD;
he'll marry me. A man that could treat his wife so&#xD;
shamefully is not sure to treat his mistress any better.&#xD;
I have devoted myself to him for years, and hav.~&#xD;

nothing to show for it. A living is all I have gained,&#xD;
and even that may not last. This planter is agree-&#xD;
able and rich ,and has such delightfully obsequious&#xD;
servants. If 1 could secure him by pretending to&#xD;
good blood, since I have no fortune-it is evidently&#xD;
my last chance, and a good one too. I must do it,&#xD;
by all means. My beauty is not faded much, thank&#xD;
Heaven !" And Allen: "This Frenchwoinan Is&#xD;
excellent capital for me. She entertains like a prin-&#xD;
cess, and is certainly agreeable. One of these days I&#xD;
shall take her by surprise, and get more of her confi-&#xD;
dence than she is intending to give me."&#xD;
Of course this play could not last too long with&#xD;
safety, and Allen began to talk of going, his servants&#xD;
having exhausted their imaginations in telling tales&#xD;
of the wonderful possessions of their master, and his&#xD;
princely residence at home, on a plantation with two&#xD;
thousand negroes, and an income of fabulous amount.&#xD;
The mention of Allen's departure put- Mlle. N-&#xD;
in a state of nervous excitement. "Oh, not yet; you&#xD;
will stay a day or two more. We will have a hunt&#xD;
to-day, an excursion to Lake Erne to-morrow; there&#xD;
- are a dozen things I want you to see before you go."&#xD;
So he promised to stay for the hunt. This sort of&#xD;
amusement with nobody but the inmates of the castle,&#xD;
the steward and a few rather dull people, did not&#xD;
seem to offer much amusement; neither was Allen a&#xD;
very good rider when it came to a regular chase over&#xD;
hedges and ditches; but he was glad of the oppor-&#xD;
tunity which it might offer to get into Mlle. N-'s&#xD;
confidence, in one way or another.&#xD;
Allen had his own opinion of hunting, as practiced&#xD;
&#xD;
by the English, aside from his dread arising from&#xD;
inexperience. In the first place, it is cruel and&#xD;
hazardous to horse and rider, as well as to the poor&#xD;
creature pursued and killed for the amusement of&#xD;
idle people. And, secondly, it is a reckless waste of&#xD;
the labors of the poor, by breaking down hedges and&#xD;
otherwise destroying property. He sees in it the&#xD;
same principle which inspires the gamester, and finds&#xD;
it legalize4 upon the same principle. The English&#xD;
law makes a man a vagrant who attempts to kill even&#xD;
a partridge, unless he is the owner of an estate that&#xD;
brings an income of one hundred pounds per annum&#xD;
-the money sanctifying the act! But, for this occa-&#xD;
sion, Allen sets aside his scruples, and undertakes to&#xD;
make one in the long-famed chase of old English&#xD;
nobles and gentlemen. As his negroes were alto-&#xD;
gether unused to this sort of sport, two good riders&#xD;
were appointed to his service who could outdo him&#xD;
on an oe~asion like this, with all ease. The horses&#xD;
were fine hunters, and, to those up to the sport, would&#xD;
have furnished high excitement. After a little beat-&#xD;
ing about, a deer was started. The gamekeeper had&#xD;
given strict orders that the deer should not be killed&#xD;
when he turned out the hounds, but the savage&#xD;
fellows had been without sport for some time,&#xD;
and their eyes told plainly enough the fate of the&#xD;
luckless animal. The horses, too, seemed to anti-&#xD;
cipate the sport with eagerness, as they pranced and&#xD;
curvetted.&#xD;
At a word from the sportsmen, the chase was&#xD;
started. Whoop! Hurrah! Over ditches and&#xD;
hedges, through bogs and, through uplands, as if the&#xD;

Now up a steep hill, now over a bog; and a stream&#xD;
to cross where the deer gathers strength by swim-&#xD;
mm o" now he reaches a glen, where the hounds lose&#xD;
sight of him for a while. how the hounds and&#xD;
horses plunge through that place!&#xD;
Allen was a little disconcerted at first, by this pell-&#xD;
inell proceeding; but, finding that his hunter under-&#xD;
stood the business and he had only to keep his place,&#xD;
he relinquished himself to the spirit of the chase. A&#xD;
first-rate hunter will dash up a steep bank, go over a&#xD;
wall, and alight on a pavement with a force that' sends&#xD;
the blood sporting from his own feet and his rider's&#xD;
nose, without stopping. But this sport was doomed&#xD;
to a sudden termination, for one of the party, Mlle.&#xD;
N--, was caught by the limb of a tree, dragged&#xD;
from her horse, and fell to the ground with terrible&#xD;
force. Allen, who rode beside her, instantly stopped,&#xD;
though the party kept on as if nothing had happened.&#xD;
Perhaps it was not noticed, but the unfortunate per-&#xD;
son was severely hurt, and there was no one to assist&#xD;
her but the planter. Of this, notwithstanding her&#xD;
injuries, the Frenchwoman was rather glad, since&#xD;
compelled him to be more tender to her than he ~&#xD;
yet been called upon to be. The nature of her inju-&#xD;
ries prevented her removal to the castle for the&#xD;
present, and quarters were found for her in a farm-&#xD;
house near by. Poor enough thoy were, and served&#xD;
as an excuse for a daily visit from Allen, to see thut&#xD;
she had everything necessary to her comfort. Had&#xD;
Mfle. N- been a lovely and pure girl in these&#xD;
circumstances, there would be no security against his&#xD;
&#xD;
falling ill love with her ; but, as it was, he only&#xD;
wickedly pretended to do so.&#xD;
The opportunity furnished was far too good to let&#xD;
pass, for inquiring into the secrets of the Fredonia&#xD;
hiniily. Deceived by his attentions, and the words&#xD;
let fall from time to time of interesting meaniiw' the.&#xD;
poor woman was completely duped, and confided to&#xD;
her supposed lover the truth of Lady Fredonia's situ-&#xD;
ation, together with the intentions of the bishop,&#xD;
and many facts unguesseci by her questioner. Of&#xD;
course she concealed her own complicity in the busi-&#xD;
ness, and affected a horror of the bishop's wicked-&#xD;
ness. From her revelations, Allen learned that Woods&#xD;
was living, and in such circumstances as afforded&#xD;
some hope that he might be able to see him. He&#xD;
had, as was suspected, been removed from Dublin to&#xD;
a private prison by the chancellor, at the instance of&#xD;
Bishop Fredonia, who thought tims to defeat the&#xD;
untiring efforts of Miss Cunningham to bring about a&#xD;
union with him. The two, together, aftem' all they&#xD;
had suffered, might prove dangerous enemies to his&#xD;

The condition of Lady Fredonia was found to be&#xD;
very painful. Deprived of her liberty and treated&#xD;
hs incurably insane, she was subject to the most&#xD;
shocking neglect. The cruelties which,, in a smaller&#xD;
way, she had once visited upon her own child, she&#xD;
was now compelled to suffer. Allen was moved with&#xD;

Fredonia to America to join her daughter, who would&#xD;
gladly receive her and minister to her consolation.&#xD;
The plan met ready acquiescence from inademoislie,&#xD;
who owed the bishop a spite; but how was this to be&#xD;
effected speedily and safely before the return of the&#xD;
bishop? 11cr ladyship was ill and infirm, and could&#xD;
not act for herself. Allen met this objection with a&#xD;
plan which obviated all difficulties. If she would&#xD;
give him authority to visit Lady Fredonia, he would&#xD;
go and prepare her for the event, at the same time&#xD;
giving her some strengthening drugs to make her&#xD;
equal to the undertaking. This seemed a feasible&#xD;
plan, to which mademoisile consented. Writing a&#xD;
note to the servant who attended on her ladyship,&#xD;
she gave it to him, assuring him it would procure him&#xD;
an interview in which he could arrange the prelimi-&#xD;
naries of the journey with the invalid. Taking this,&#xD;
and bidding her take care to be well recovered in a&#xD;
few days, Allen hastened over to the castle, and after&#xD;
seeing the steward he presented the note to the ser-&#xD;
vant of Lady Fredonia.&#xD;
Though somewhat surprised at this irregular pro-&#xD;
ceeding, the servant made no objection, and lie was ad-&#xD;
mitted to the apartments of her ladyship. Good&#xD;
heaven! is this the protection which women have? In&#xD;

OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        297&#xD;
that portion of the castle long abandoned, looking like&#xD;
a saint's purgatory in its gloom and ghostliness, has&#xD;
Lady Fredonia spent years of her life which ought&#xD;
to have been in its prime! It might have startled&#xD;
stronger nerves to have come suddenly upon such a&#xD;
spectre as her ladyship appeared to unaccustomed&#xD;
eyes. The colorless skin of the once handsome face&#xD;
was fairly dried into the bones; the large, black eyes&#xD;
had a strangely supernatural fire, contrasting fearfully&#xD;
with the emaciated countenance. The appearance of&#xD;
a stranger startled her, not having seen any but her&#xD;
regular attendants in years of isolation, an unfamiliar&#xD;
face at once announced some change in her affairs,&#xD;
whether for better or worse. Allen relieved her con-&#xD;
fusion as quickly as possible by making an announce-&#xD;
ment of himself in such a manner as to disarm all&#xD;
fears of its being for the wor~c. It was with difficulty&#xD;
he commanded his own feelings sufficiently to enter&#xD;
upon his business with the dispatch necessary.&#xD;
"I have brought you a letter from your daughter,"&#xD;
said he, as naturally as possible.&#xD;
"My daughter! poor Marion !" cried her ladyshiy,&#xD;
bursting into tears.&#xD;
"She lives; I have not murdered her! Oh, I thank&#xD;
thee, Heaven!&#xD;
"Your daughter lives, and is well, and very anx-&#xD;
ious to hear from her mother," answered Allen, com-&#xD;
posedly. I have taken great pains to procure this in-&#xD;
terview, and n-inst make it as comprehensive as pos-&#xD;
sible, lie then went on to state all that lie thought&#xD;
she might wish to know concerning Marion: and to&#xD;
tell of her late visit to Ireland, and the suit she had&#xD;

entered, and the Inanner in which it had been de-&#xD;
fended. 11cr ladyship was very much affected, and&#xD;
thanked him again and again for his part in assisting&#xD;
her daughter, who, she acknowledged, she had liii-&#xD;
justly persecuted.&#xD;
"What can I (10 to serve your ladyship ?" he asked.&#xD;
"Convey this paper to her," she answered, produc-&#xD;
ing from the folds of her dress a yellow looking doen-&#xD;
meut. "It is a will by her father, Lord Charles Cun-&#xD;
ningham. Ask her to refrain from settling it for three&#xD;
years longer. I shall then be in my grave, probably,&#xD;
and its settlement will bring no disgrace on me. My&#xD;
own property is disposed of, and nothing remains but&#xD;
to have the estate claimed and settled when I am&#xD;
dead. There has been so much trouble already, I shrink&#xD;
from having any further contention with my enemies&#xD;
and Marion's; and now that her property is secured&#xD;
to her, I only ask her to wait a little longer. 11cr&#xD;
forgiveness I cannot ask, though I' hope God has&#xD;
enabled her to bestow it. In addition to the assur-&#xD;
ances of my affection, which I wish you to bear to her,&#xD;
tell her from inc that I repent of having opposed her&#xD;
union with the man of her choice, and that, should&#xD;
fortune favor them to escape from the power of their&#xD;
enemies, I give my cordial consent to their ~~rriage.~~&#xD;
This conversation so exhausted her ladyship that&#xD;
she was obliged to lie down, while Allen sat beside&#xD;
her and gave her a few more words of comfort.&#xD;
"Be assured," said he, "that you will yet see hap-&#xD;
pier days. Your daughter is by 110 means greatly&#xD;
injured by the trials through which she has passed.&#xD;
They have strengthened her virtues, and corrected her&#xD;
&#xD;
faults; and when she is assured of your afh~ction and&#xD;
restored to her rights, she will have nothing to regret&#xD;
on her own account. It is Marion's belief that good&#xD;
will yet come out of all this evil. Try, therefore, to&#xD;
take heart, and look forward to the good time&#xD;
coiflhlig."&#xD;
Lady Fredonia thanked her visitor for ins encour-&#xD;
aging words, butt ~Inile(l iiicredulousl at the idea&#xD;
of ever seeing the time lie spoke of, when she might&#xD;
yet be happy. She seemed quite overcome at his de-&#xD;
parture, and lie left her lying in a fiuinting condition&#xD;
upon a couch.&#xD;
Allen had succeeded almost beyond his hopes. All&#xD;
that could be gained by a knowledge of the premises&#xD;
he had gained. having written a very tender note&#xD;
to Mile. N , and bidden adieu to the stew-&#xD;
ard, our adventurer de})arted, with his two negroes,&#xD;

now was Gen. Arsdell's. The general, who lia(l beard&#xD;
nothing from him for a long time, was half demented&#xD;
with astonishment and delight at the story of Allen's&#xD;
exploits. "Why, boy, 1 believe you are l)ossesse(l of&#xD;
the devil. None but the old gentleman himself would&#xD;
have dared to venture on such dangerous grounds."&#xD;
"That's the first time I ever heard that the devil&#xD;

much reputation for courage in our country."&#xD;
Well, ~OU are an imI) I am heartily glad to see,&#xD;
and the ' very devil for luck ' any way ;" said the&#xD;
general, giving his hand a squeeze. It was true that,&#xD;
from the first, Allen's movements had been fortunate,&#xD;
and that, but for him, Marion would have been in&#xD;

&#xD;
the deepest misery at the present time; perhaps in&#xD;
the condition of her mother. The general informed&#xD;
Allen that Lord Potter had written to him to know&#xD;
where he was, saying he had important news for&#xD;
him; so, as soon as he had made a little visit with the&#xD;
general, he posted off again to Cork.&#xD;
Lord Potter met him 'with every luark of friend-&#xD;
ship, entertaining him at his house. As it was now&#xD;
about four months since his friends, Sheldon Brown,&#xD;
Marion and Annie ,had left Scotland, he was glad to&#xD;
find several letters-some old and some new. The&#xD;
first one from his mother expressed her delight at the&#xD;
present he bad sent her of a lovely young daughter,&#xD;
and urged him to hasten home. Those of a later date&#xD;
made him gasp for breath. The story of Annie Stew-&#xD;
art having been circulated among the people in her&#xD;
neighborhood, had come to the ears of some envious&#xD;
English 'who had written home about it, and, unfor-&#xD;
tunately, it had reached the ears of interested parties.&#xD;
The next thing Mrs. Allen heard of it, 'was that the&#xD;
Catholics claimed Annie; saying she had escaped&#xD;
from a Catholic school, and there 'were threats made&#xD;
of having her taken forcibly, and s~nt to a liunnery.&#xD;
Full of alarm, Mrs. Allen 'wrote to her son about it;&#xD;
but, she informed him that the Alnericans were not&#xD;
going to permit it, if they had to tear down every&#xD;
church, school and nunnery belonging to the Catho-&#xD;
lics; and as she was very careful of Annie, she hoped&#xD;
to have no serious trouble about it. Still she urged&#xD;
him to come home.&#xD;
This was exciting news to Allen. Oh, that he had&#xD;
the wings of a dove, to fly to the protection of Annie&#xD;
&#xD;
Stewart! But, as he had not, ~nd there were several&#xD;
things to detain him, and one most especially, he&#xD;
immediately sought Lord Potter's advice on the sub-&#xD;
ject. "I do not think Annie in any great danger, if&#xD;
your mother is careful enough to keep her at home,&#xD;
as I have no doubt she will. Your people are not&#xD;
going to allow a young girl to be carried off against&#xD;
her 'will, and put in a convent, and you 'would not be&#xD;
afraid of it, if any other person was the one threat-&#xD;
ened."&#xD;
"Perhaps not," said Allen, blushing with a con-&#xD;
sciousness of the truth of this accusation. "The&#xD;
only thing to fear is the secret power of the Irish, of&#xD;
whom there are leo'ions in all our cities. My mother&#xD;
says this affair has unade considerable stir among the&#xD;
servant girls, living in Protestant families, and they&#xD;
may take it into their heads to spirit her away, if by&#xD;
doing so they can gain the approbation of the&#xD;
church."&#xD;
"They might do that in this country, but not in&#xD;
the United States. The Catholic church is m e&#xD;
politic than to risk her reputation in that way mere.&#xD;
Not until she imagines she has the power in he' own&#xD;
hands, will she undertake to use coercive measures&#xD;
openly. If you will allow me to show your mother's&#xD;
letter to a priest in this place, I ~vi1l show you how&#xD;
the Catholics feel about such things!"&#xD;
Accordingly, they went together to the priest, who&#xD;
pretended, or felt the greatest indignation: The dig-&#xD;
nity and integrity of the church was outraged by suel&#xD;
supposition. It must have been a scandal altogether.&#xD;
his patriotism cries against such things. lie will&#xD;

make haste to find out the truth; but it is not to be&#xD;
credited that such a thing could be true, in America&#xD;
especially, where the people are so tenacious of their&#xD;
rio'hts and where the church has always made it a&#xD;
point to respect them. lie would investigate it&#xD;
immediately-he would write a letter that very atter-,&#xD;
noon to the church in America. If such a thin~ could&#xD;
be true there would be mourning in heaven and at&#xD;
Rome. Why, the young lady's friends were all Pro-&#xD;
testants; it could not be that they could have had&#xD;
any connection with the Catholic church.&#xD;
"You see," said Lord Potter, "that the priest&#xD;
acknowledges the foolishness of such a proceeding.&#xD;
He knows the ill effect of an Irish outbreak like that&#xD;
occasioned by this Annie Stewart affair in your coun-&#xD;
try. He foresees that it will set your people to think-&#xD;
ing about the propriety of allowing the present&#xD;
immense emigration to continue, and really inj nrc&#xD;
the cause of the Irish and the church. When I&#xD;
behold how my countrymen deport themselves in&#xD;
the United States, I am led to exclaim, 'Oh foolish&#xD;
Irishmen! who hath bewitched you,' that you should&#xD;
not, live quietly and obey the laws where there are&#xD;
so many inducements to good habits? There, if you&#xD;
would, you might shake off your shackles, and be&#xD;
free as you never before were. There you have no&#xD;
occasion to drink yourselves stupid to lose the sense&#xD;
of your misery. There your wives and children may&#xD;
be comfortably fed and clothed, and yourselves re-&#xD;
spectable and happy. Oh, foolish Irishmen indeed!"&#xD;
Father O'Grady, who was a man of sense, realized&#xD;
the folly which was losing the friendship of the Amen-&#xD;
&#xD;
can people so recklessly, and sincerely deplored it.&#xD;
So did other Irishmen. They resented the interfer-&#xD;
ence of the English which had occasioned the Annie&#xD;
Stewart troubles; and were furious at the "London&#xD;
Times" for the nianner in which it warned the United&#xD;
States against ad opting these lawless and ungrateful&#xD;
Irish. The stoi;y of these injuries ran like wildfire&#xD;
among the men of Cork, and stirred up a spirit of&#xD;
ferocity among the people toward the English.&#xD;
An anecdote came to AllCIl's ears which aston-&#xD;
ished him. It appeared that a servant of Lord Pot-&#xD;
ter, a quick, intelligent young fellow, who, though&#xD;
a Protestant, was no friend to the English, had been&#xD;
at the head of a band that took it into their hands to&#xD;
punish the nation in the persons of a party of English&#xD;
lords, who had come over to hunt in Ireland. The&#xD;
young man's name was Daniel Sharp, a very popular&#xD;
person among a certain class of men in Cork. So&#xD;
well trained were his associates that a nod of the&#xD;
head, or a wink of the eye, was sufficient to indicate&#xD;
to them the presence of an occasion to be on the&#xD;
alert. If the enterprise was a dangerous one and&#xD;
they had not time to resort to lampblack, their faces&#xD;
were quickly smeared with boo-dirt which was just&#xD;
as good a disguise as any.&#xD;
Lord S , who lived on the nearest estate, was&#xD;
losing his best tenants by emigration. Those to whom&#xD;
they sold their leases were not as good men, and&#xD;
would not be able to pay him as high rates as the old&#xD;
tenants; therefore he was greatly dissatisfied, and pro-&#xD;
nounced them all a nest of vipers, who had no grati-&#xD;
tude in their natures. It was with Lord S - that&#xD;

304      THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL;&#xD;
&#xD;
the English hunting party were staying. One Spreg,&#xD;
an emigrating tenant of Lord Sheldon, was very inti-&#xD;
mate with Sharp, and repeated to him all the bitter&#xD;
things his lordship had said about the Irish. Toge-&#xD;
ther the two concerted to have a little sport out of&#xD;
his lordship and his friends~. Lying in wait for them&#xD;
one day, they affected to have been surprised by a&#xD;
meeting on one of the farms of the estate. "So&#xD;
Spreg, you are still bound for America ?" said Lord&#xD;
Sheldon, to his fcrrmer tenant.&#xD;
"Troth, that's what I am," answered Spreg.&#xD;
"You must look out that the American Eagle does&#xD;
not pick out the eyes of her Irish brood," said one of&#xD;
the lords, sneeringly.&#xD;
"Yes, eagles devour reptiles," put in another,&#xD;
smiling at his own wit.&#xD;
," Reptiles, is it ?" thundered David Sharp. "No-&#xD;
thing in that shape ever grew on Irish soil! It is&#xD;
your precious England produces every beastly thing&#xD;
from a lion to a serpent."&#xD;
"Whelp !" ejaculated the enraged lord, and with&#xD;
that he struck at Sharp with a riding-whip.&#xD;
"Take care, your lordship; the lion' 8 whelp will&#xD;
find that a man, even an Irishman, is his master,&#xD;
according to the order of creation. We understand&#xD;
the nature of your mother the British Lion; we&#xD;
know her threatening ways and her sneaking ways;&#xD;
and when an Englishman takes us by the hand,&#xD;
saying, 'how is it with thee my brother,' we expect&#xD;
him to stab us under the fifth rib; yet, some of us&#xD;
are not afraid."&#xD;
"Yon are a most insolent scoundrel, 1 declare,"&#xD;
&#xD;
said his lordship, between anger and amazement.&#xD;
"Here, Sheldon, lend me your pistols."&#xD;
The pistols were quickly produced. "Down on&#xD;
your knees, you rascal, and beg my pardon, or I'll&#xD;
blow out yonr brains on the spot."&#xD;
Sharp gave a peculiar cry, which, in a moment,&#xD;
brought fifty ugly-looking bogtrotters around the&#xD;
little1~arty of a haIt~dozen lords. At this demonstra-&#xD;
tion, Lord Sheldon tried to make a jest of the affair,&#xD;
by laughing and declaring Sharp a "cunning rascal."&#xD;
The pistols were put up and a disposition to amity&#xD;
shown. But Sharp was not satisfied with this termi-.&#xD;
nation of the affair. lie placed himself in the midst&#xD;
of the circle which had closed around their lordships,&#xD;
and made a speech wherein he set forth the traits of&#xD;
the beast known as a lion in no very complimentary&#xD;
colors. At the close* of this address, his followers set&#xD;
up a yell that might have appalled stouter hearts&#xD;
than those lordly ones.&#xD;
"Now," said the orator, addressing Ii himself to their&#xD;
lordsliips, "we are going to know who set afoot that&#xD;
mischief about Annie Stewart, and who her relatives&#xD;
are that deserted her, and all the rest about her that&#xD;
any of you know. Here is a bottle to wet your&#xD;
throat, after Pvc drunk to the land which gives pro-&#xD;
tection to the homeless."&#xD;
The temper of an English lord could not endure&#xD;
this familiar way of being treated, and Sharp re-&#xD;
ceived a slap on his cheek with the flat of a gloved&#xD;
hand. The blow was returned with interest, and a&#xD;
fight was likely to ensue, when both parties inter-&#xD;
fered to prevent it.&#xD;

&#xD;
To end the matter, Sharp produced writing mate-&#xD;
rials from his pocket and proceeded to take a deposi-&#xD;
tion from the discomfited lord concerning the origin&#xD;
and connections and rights of Annie Stewart; pro-&#xD;
mising him to let him go for the present and future,&#xD;
if he told tIme truth, and never to reveal the degrada-&#xD;
tion he had been subjected to. Thus surrounded&#xD;
with dangers out of which time one 1air of pistols in&#xD;
the company never could bring them, his lordship&#xD;
complied, though with rather a bad grace. The story&#xD;
was essentially the same which Annie told, though&#xD;
revealing some facts of which she was ignorant. The&#xD;
party were then suffered to proceed on their walk,&#xD;
while the delighted Irishmen disappeared in various&#xD;
directions. Most of them were disguised so as not to&#xD;
be recognized, but Spreg made haste to get out of the&#xD;
way of an arrest, while Sharp, who knew that Lord&#xD;
Sheldon could not identify him, only laughed and&#xD;
told the story to his friends.&#xD;
Lord Potter felt the affair to be an outrage ; but&#xD;
he knew how much provocation the Irish daily suffer&#xD;
without retaliating, and lie could not reprove Sharp&#xD;
as severely as he deserved. Besides, Allen was very&#xD;
glad to learn the few additional particulars concern-&#xD;
ing Annie's rights of birth, as it might help to esta-&#xD;
blish her in them at some future day.&#xD;
The story got out in Cork, and a great effort was&#xD;
made to arrest the guilty parties without any success.&#xD;
S6me were already on their way to America and some.&#xD;
had so successfully disguised themselves that no one&#xD;
could have recognized them after the change of clothes&#xD;
and complexion. The class to which the rogues be-&#xD;

longed kept themselves very quiet, and the authori-&#xD;
ties were entirely at a loss.&#xD;
At last, however, an informer appeared, to claim&#xD;
the reward which had beeu offered. She was an old&#xD;
woman, more like a witch than any other creature,&#xD;
who professed to know where these outlaws resorted,&#xD;
and promised to betray their retreat to the police if&#xD;
she would be protected afterward. She was retained&#xD;
as a witness, and received the required promise.&#xD;
Only at night, she said, the outlaws could be taken&#xD;
in their haunts. Accordingly, at night the police&#xD;
turned out in force, accompanied by the injured lord,&#xD;
who wished to be certain of his men.&#xD;
The pith pursued, after leaving the city behind&#xD;
them, led along the edge of a large bogwhich, in usual&#xD;
times, was passable enough ; but late rains had swol-&#xD;
len all the small streams, and the temporary bridges&#xD;
gave way in a good many instances, Precipitating&#xD;
theni into the watei', and making the passage so dan-&#xD;
gerous that the party were tempted to turn back.&#xD;
The night was Pitchy dark, and drizzling rain falling.&#xD;
In the midst of a scene of confusion caused by the&#xD;
giving way of the timbers of a small bridge, their&#xD;
guide escaped from them and was lost in the darkness.&#xD;
Shortly the sound of a trumpet was heard and torches&#xD;
appeared here and there, borne by figures hearingg&#xD;
green breeches and red jackets and caps of a pictu-&#xD;
resque shape. Slowly these torches gathered together&#xD;
and fQrmed in a company at a safe distance from the&#xD;
police, who could not tell whether these were the men&#xD;
they were after or not, though they presumed they&#xD;
must be. The torches however, kept flitting on at&#xD;

&#xD;
about the same distance from their pursuers, obeying&#xD;
rapidly the commands of the handsome trumpeter,&#xD;
who at a sound caused them to scatter or gather, or&#xD;
light or extinguish their torches.&#xD;
The whole scene was fanciful and mysterious in&#xD;
the extreme, and the pursuing party, fearful of being&#xD;
led into some danger, gave up the chase. The excuse&#xD;
made by the Irish portion of them was that they&#xD;
knew the torch-bearers were fairies, and would have&#xD;
done them harm if they had continued the pursuit.&#xD;
Thus ended this excursion in superstitious fear-as&#xD;
nearly every undertaking in Ireland does end-and&#xD;
the English lord had to swallow the indignities put&#xD;
upon him with no hope of redress.&#xD;
An explanation of the scene which so alarmed the&#xD;
police, could have been found in the scene which fol-&#xD;
lowed their retreat. Gathered together in an old&#xD;
ruin, were a company of men, amongst whom&#xD;
might have been recognized Daniel Sharp and Spreg,&#xD;
all dressed in the costume described, and seated&#xD;
around a table whereon was a little food and drink.&#xD;
The party were not as merry as outlaws sometimes&#xD;
are, for they were met together for the last time.&#xD;
Most of the company were going to emigrate to Ame-&#xD;
rica-; a few, like Sharp, remained behind for the&#xD;
present: Many an act of retribution had they per-&#xD;
formed, and many a cruelty avenged, which in no&#xD;
other way could be either avenged or resisted. Few&#xD;
crimes had been committed by them, except in acts&#xD;
of self-defence; but they were sufficiently obnoxious&#xD;
to the laws to be in danger of transportation should&#xD;
any of their number ever be taken. Money they had&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
little of, and expected to beg their way to some.&#xD;
northern port, where passage could be taken to Ame-&#xD;
rica.- Those who were better provided, gave of their&#xD;
means to the .rest, and so they separated. Their plan&#xD;
was to travel on foot at night, asking food at the&#xD;
houses of the poor, in the name of the "little people."&#xD;
It is the custom in Irish houses to leave the fire burn-&#xD;
ing, and food where it can be found for the accommo-&#xD;
dation of these little folks ; so our travellers in red&#xD;
jackets and caps were not likely to starve;- and if&#xD;
ever they needed service it was always safe to confide&#xD;
in the iRoman priests, the only safe confidants.&#xD;
Sometimes they are punished by them, but never-&#xD;
betrayed. It was, the intention of this company to&#xD;
reach Belfast and thence take ship, furnishing their&#xD;
own provisions and foregoing all luxuries.&#xD;
Notwithstanding all these men have suffered and&#xD;
done, they will weep when they part from their&#xD;
native land. Such is the Irish "heart of them."&#xD;

ALLEN was now furnished with evidence to serve&#xD;
in the case of an application being made for Annie's&#xD;
property; but he gave little thought to that at pre-&#xD;
sent. First of all things, he wished to get his o~x n&#xD;
business, or rather Marion's, in such a state that lie&#xD;
could leave for home. He therefore left it to Lord&#xD;
Potter to watch Annie's interest in England, while&#xD;
he made preparations to accomplish his other purposes.&#xD;
In the meantime, matters of importance were tran-&#xD;
spiring on the old Cunningham estate. The bishop&#xD;
had returned from England, where lie had beemi&#xD;
endeavoring to make such provisions for his wife as&#xD;
would save his own honor and add to his worldly&#xD;
prosperity, to find that a stranger had been flirting&#xD;
with his mistress, and taking the castle by storni&#xD;
generally. A quarrel with Mile. N- was the&#xD;
first result of this discovery; but they were altogether&#xD;
too necessary to each other to hold displeasure long,&#xD;
and the breach was soon healed. What the errand&#xD;
of the Arnericail had been, he could not learn, so he&#xD;

to ~OSSC55 himself of the will which he supposed to be&#xD;
in her ladyship's possession. The Queen's Bench had&#xD;
promised to appoint some member of the house of&#xD;
Lords to investigate Lady Fredonia's case, and if&#xD;
found to be incurably insane, to make such provisions&#xD;

as were deemed best for a person of her position.&#xD;
That she should be found insane, the bishop was&#xD;
resolved; therefore, with his nerves well bound and&#xD;
braced for the emergency by those "cords of love"&#xD;
lie had talked so much about all his life, the holy&#xD;
man sought an interview with his cherished wife.&#xD;
On entering her apartment, accompanied by his sym-&#xD;
pathizing mistress, he met with a very cold and&#xD;
dignified reception. Now that her mind was at rest&#xD;
about the future welfare of her daughter, Lady Fre-&#xD;
donia had dismissed all anxiety concerning herself,&#xD;
and felt ready to meet any IJersonal indignities with&#xD;
calmness. This indifference rather surprised her&#xD;
tyrant, who had so long expected her to quail before&#xD;
his anger. Advancing toward her couch, where she&#xD;
reclined, he called her attention to the fact that he&#xD;
had come for the last time to demand the will of her&#xD;
former husbaud, which she had stubbornly refused to&#xD;
have known. The time had come when it ought to&#xD;
be settled, and 8liould be; hence her ladyship must&#xD;
make up her mind to part with it.&#xD;
"The will, and all else that I have guarded and&#xD;
held sacred, are beyond your reach, and ever will be;&#xD;
let me alone to die in peace." Her ladyship had&#xD;
risen, and was sitting upon the side of her couch.&#xD;
The bishop grasped her shoulder firmly, while he&#xD;
sternly said: " Give me the will !"&#xD;
"I have it not; it is goiie from lien cc," she an-&#xD;
swered, firmly.&#xD;
"Liar and traitress !" lie exclaimed, shaking her&#xD;
roughly. A paper fell from her bosom upon the&#xD;
floor. MIle. N-i------ eagerly snatched at it, and ran&#xD;

from the room with her prize. "Know," continued the&#xD;
bishop, "that you have no tower to thwart my wishes.&#xD;
The law of England gives me unlimited authority&#xD;
over you and yours, from the day of your marriage.&#xD;
In a legal sense, you have ceased to exist, arid it is&#xD;
time you recognized my rights. If you do what is&#xD;
your duty I may reward you with some kindness;&#xD;
but, if you continue in this course, I promise to visit&#xD;
my wrath upon you as you deserve."&#xD;
Before the bishop had finished his lecture, Mile.&#xD;
N-- returned to the apartment in great haste and&#xD;
excitement. "Look here," said she; "here is a&#xD;
letter from Marion Cunningham, which her ladyship&#xD;
has lately received. It is the paper which I took&#xD;
from her just now." The bishop took it and glanced&#xD;
over it. "Ha! how came you by this letter, Lady&#xD;
Fredonia! There has been intrigue at work here.&#xD;
How does it come, mademoiselle, that in my absence a&#xD;
correspondence of this kind is smuggled into my&#xD;
house? This is some of your American's doings;&#xD;
which, if I find you have been party to, I will turn&#xD;
you out of doors."&#xD;
"Indeed, 1 know nothing about it," whimpered&#xD;
mademoiselle, who recollected the note she bad given&#xD;
to Allen, in alarm.&#xD;
"There i~ somebody knows about it, and that person&#xD;
will account for his treachery," said his holiness, in&#xD;
rather a bad humor.&#xD;
"Her ladyship knows, of course," suggested Mile.&#xD;
~-- and with the quickness of a cat she sprang at&#xD;
Lady Fredonia, and clenched her throat between her&#xD;
fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.       313&#xD;
An attendant, who happened to be present, inter-&#xD;
fered, and received a blow upon her cheek from the&#xD;
furious Frenchwoman. The bishop then withdrew&#xD;
her from the apartment until he could come to some&#xD;
conclusion about the matter. He called the stew-&#xD;
ard to account, but the steward knew nothing in&#xD;
regard to the letter; and the result of his investiga-&#xD;
tion only brought the blame of the mischance upon&#xD;
* Mile. N , who, the servant said, sent a note&#xD;
authorizing her to admit Mr. Allen to her ladyship's&#xD;
presence.&#xD;
Mile. N- was in great consternation at this dis-&#xD;
covery, and at the bishop's wrath; but she furnished&#xD;
him such valuable council in the case, that he was&#xD;
obliged to forgive her. It was conceived in her fer-&#xD;
tile brain that a drug might be given Lady Fredonia,&#xD;
to make her insane, so that the investigation would&#xD;
not prove a failure-a drug she said, which would&#xD;
not affect the health of the patient dangerously.&#xD;
The bishop cautioned her against that, as his hold&#xD;
upon the property terminated with the life of her&#xD;
ladyship, and his residence in Cunningham Castle&#xD;
expired with her breath. Truly this was a trying&#xD;
position for a bishop to be in! He did not like to&#xD;
be guilty of murder, though his wife was a great vex-&#xD;
ation to him, and his enjoyment of her property&#xD;
ceased with her heart-beats. He wanted her to be&#xD;
alive, but incapable of controlling her possessions, in&#xD;
order that the office of controller might the more&#xD;
entirely devolve upon him, and he wanted her to give&#xD;
up the will which might deprive him of some of&#xD;
these privileges and emoluments. If a bishop and a&#xD;

pillar of the Church desired all this, and had ,a legal&#xD;
pretence for exacting it, it was a very hard case to be&#xD;
frustrated in the accomplishment of his wishes. Very&#xD;
hard case, truly!&#xD;
After hearing the plan proposed by his mistress,&#xD;
and not knowing what had been done with the will,&#xD;
he thought it expedient to try the effect of flattery&#xD;
on the female heart, before administering that drug&#xD;
which would really render his wife incapable of&#xD;
understanding his wishes. Accordingly, he dismissed&#xD;
her attendants, and with his face adorned with the&#xD;
most captivating smiles, approached her ladyship&#xD;
with the deference and blandishments of courtship&#xD;
days. He regretted his harshness, and confessed&#xD;
that the superior devotion she seemed to feel for her&#xD;
daughter had maddened him with jealousy, and made&#xD;
him do things unworthy of himriself and cruel&#xD;
toward her. But he wished now to have these&#xD;
things forgotten. lie remindQd her of their first&#xD;
meeting, the impression her beauty then made upon&#xD;
him, and his subsequent devotion. Could she recall&#xD;
these recollections and forget their more recent mis-&#xD;
understandings ~&#xD;
Lady Fredonia heard him through with calmness,&#xD;
and replied unmoved, that the time had gone by&#xD;
when such an appeal could have any effect upon her.&#xD;
That from the first days of their marriage all his&#xD;
efforts at pleasing her had been directed toward get-&#xD;
ting possession ~of her own and her daughter's pro-&#xD;
perty. That, in proportion as he had failed in this&#xD;
he failed in duty toward her. That he had full con-&#xD;
trol of her person and property, but that was not&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN ~wo WORLDS.       315&#xD;
enough, though she should never assist him to any&#xD;
further power than he already had.&#xD;
In vain the bishop assured her of his friendship&#xD;
for her daughter. lie wished, he said, since she knew&#xD;
where a letter would reach her, to write to Marion&#xD;
to come home and be happy. But Lady Fredonia&#xD;
had not suffered imprisonment and abuse at his hands&#xD;
for three years to be cajc4ed suddenly into confidence&#xD;
in his motives aiid intentions. All his protestations&#xD;
failed to convince her of his sincerity. At length,&#xD;
carried quite beyond his self-control by his disappoint-&#xD;
ment and chagrin, the bishop struck her a blow upon&#xD;
the head which sent the blood sporting from her nose.&#xD;
Immediately he regretted this action, as it was not&#xD;
his policy to injure her in such a manner as might&#xD;
endanger her life. But the cool composure with&#xD;
which she suffered even this at his hands, and asked&#xD;
him to strike more effectually next time that she&#xD;
might sometime die, exasperated him. " You may&#xD;
well wish to die,'~ was the answer, "for what you&#xD;
will have to endure will he worse than death."&#xD;
"I know not," she said, "whether to think you&#xD;
man or devil; but your power to torment me will&#xD;
not last much longer."&#xD;
"We will see," lie said, giving her a push which in&#xD;
her faint condition sent hwr reeling against the wall,&#xD;
and left the room, pleased with his success.&#xD;
The attendant in Lady Fredonia's apartment was&#xD;
dismissed from that position, and one put in her place&#xD;
who had' been obnoxious to her ladyship, being one&#xD;
of those "bound" servants, no better tham~ slaves,&#xD;
having no interest in being dutiful or capable. Mhle.&#xD;

N- discovered that this old servant had a great&#xD;
longing to get away from service and go to some&#xD;
relations in America. She therefore promised her&#xD;
that reward, for six months of faithful service and obe-.&#xD;
dience to her wishes. The old woman gave renewed&#xD;
assurances of obedience, and accepted her new posi-&#xD;
tion with delight. But upon coming to see her mis-&#xD;
tress' condition, and the great change that had taken&#xD;
place in her appearance since last she had met her,&#xD;
the coarse and cross old servant was affected to tears,&#xD;
and her sympathy so moved the heart of her lady-&#xD;
ship, long dependent on servants for society, that she&#xD;
joined in her weeping, and thenceforth a tender sort&#xD;
of friendship existed between the lady and her&#xD;
uncouth attendant, that, in some degree, softened&#xD;
the rigors of her cor~finement. Together they talked&#xD;
over the old days when Lord Cunningham was alive&#xD;
-of the troubles of his daughter, and hoped the&#xD;
time would come when, Marion being restored to her&#xD;
rights, the estate and the servants would be cared&#xD;
for as formerly. Shortly after old Biddy was pro-&#xD;
moted, Mile. N- reminded her of her promise to&#xD;
be faithful, and proceeded to give her instructions&#xD;
how to administer a drug in her ladyship's food, which&#xD;
she said was to restore her health and prevent her&#xD;
becoming hopelessly insane. But Biddy was suspi-&#xD;
cious of something wrong about this peculiar medi-&#xD;
cine, and communicated her fears to her mistress,&#xD;
who of course, refused 1the "medical" preparation.&#xD;
Poor old Biddy protested to Mile. N-, that she&#xD;
had followed her directions, and so there was no-&#xD;
thing to do but to await the result.&#xD;

Meantime, preparations were going on for the&#xD;
reception of visitors at the castle. Among them was&#xD;
the Duke of , a distant relation of Lady Fre-&#xD;
donma, who was there on a former occasion, which&#xD;
has been mentioned. He was prejudiced against her&#xD;
ladyship by her behavior at that time; still, he&#xD;
thought it incumbent upon her friends to show some&#xD;
interest in her welfare, and this visit was for the pur-&#xD;
pose of ascertaining her real condition. He found&#xD;
the bishop looking pale and haggard. From this, and&#xD;
from being a regular adherent of the bishop, lie was&#xD;
much disposed to commiserate his unhappy situation.&#xD;
Mll~. N-~ made herself conspicuous by her&#xD;
affected sympathy for the afflicted lady-so much so,&#xD;
that the servants were provoked to commit some acts&#xD;
of rudeness quite out of the pale of her forgiveness.&#xD;
indeed, it happened, at last, that the bishop him-&#xD;
self was driven to desperation by the act of some&#xD;
person unknown, who, desiring to give the castle the&#xD;
odor of a certain place, to which it had long been&#xD;
akin, anointed the grates with a preparation of brim-&#xD;
stone and assafetida. The stench, which no one could&#xD;
or would account for, filled every habitable apart-&#xD;
ment, and finally drove his guests out of the house,&#xD;
haunted by the impression that his Satanic majesty&#xD;
must be residing in that neighborhood. The humilia-&#xD;
tion of this circumstance, which, for a long time was&#xD;
unaccounted for, fairly made his holiness sick; or, if&#xD;
the humiliation did not, the odor did. The servants, as&#xD;
full of superstition as usual, declared the devil&#xD;
haunted the house, and did nothing but mutter&#xD;
prayers and run to the priest for charms. The commis-&#xD;

&#xD;
sioners had gone away without seeing Lady Fredonia at&#xD;
all, and the examination was "indefinitely postponed."&#xD;
Truly, the way of the transgressor is a troublous one.&#xD;
The bishop, anxious in his mind and affected by&#xD;
the demonology of those about him, began to wonder&#xD;
if evil spirits did not sometimes haunt and torment&#xD;
mortals, who had not done their duty. No sooner did&#xD;
this idea get possession of him than he began to grow&#xD;
nervous and timid. I{aving heard of a woman who&#xD;
professed to quiet evil spirits, tell fortunes, and do&#xD;
many other wonderful thin o'5 he resolved to pay her&#xD;
a visit. She was a stranger iii the neighborhood, and&#xD;
had already attained to great popularity among the&#xD;
common people, by the marvellous revelations she had&#xD;
made of the past and future, and the rest she had&#xD;
given to unquiet souls.&#xD;
The bishop was received by this personage with an&#xD;
air of mystery, very favorable to the occasion and the&#xD;
preservation of her character as prophetess. Veiled&#xD;
and seated behind a screen, she gave forth her ora-&#xD;
cles in a low and impressive voice, with slow and&#xD;
solemn utterance.&#xD;
"What is your business with me ?" she asked of&#xD;
her lordly visitor.&#xD;
"I am afihicted with much mental trouble," said the&#xD;
bishop. "I fear I am haunted by demoniac spirits,&#xD;
so unsettled is my mind, and so unpleasant my house&#xD;
and all my circumstances."&#xD;
The prophetess was silent a few moments, and&#xD;
then said sternly: "You are guilty of treason against&#xD;
Heaven. You have imagined because you held a&#xD;
high commission from that Power, as well as from&#xD;
&#xD;
the qucen, that you were above the consequences of&#xD;
sin, whereas you are only the more amenable to all&#xD;
laws, particularly spiritual laws. You practise&#xD;
hypocrisy, cruelty, inj justice and blasphemy, daily.&#xD;
There is little hope for such as you." The bishop,&#xD;
who had been biting his lips at this unpalatable dis-&#xD;
section of his case, now asked as huinbly~as he could,&#xD;
what he must do to restore himself to his former&#xD;
peaceful state of mind.&#xD;
"There is nothing ever will restore you. When a&#xD;
man holding your high position, is guilty of such&#xD;
crimes, he sells himself to the devil. I have no&#xD;
charms nor cures for such as you." So saying, the&#xD;
prophetess withdrew altogether from sight, and&#xD;
refused to be called forth again.&#xD;
Not long afterward, it was rumored that the very&#xD;
popular fortune-teller, who was reputed rich and&#xD;
young, and whom some of the young men boasted of&#xD;
beiiig on good terms with, had turned out to be a&#xD;
man. As she was gone, there was no positive proof,&#xD;
but those young fellows who bad told their gallant-&#xD;
ries, were rather set aback by this new phase of the&#xD;
romance. To find money and beauty and a prospect&#xD;
of a promised marriage melt axvay in that manner,&#xD;
was a bitter triM to some of them, whose castles in&#xD;
Spain were now quite fallen to the ground. It is a&#xD;
hard thing for an Irishman to be outdone by a man&#xD;
from another country; but to be served so by a "ras-&#xD;
cally foreigner~' was too bad, entirely. Whoever&#xD;
the fortune-teller was, she went away with a good&#xD;
many men's secrets in her possession; and some that&#xD;
would hardly bear repeating, on account of the&#xD;
respectability of their former owners.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
THERE seems to be a stimulus in crime which&#xD;
keeps its votaries forever drinking deeper of it,&#xD;
though they know the end is ruin and death. Lord&#xD;
Charles Elia was not satisfied with the result of his&#xD;
former expedition to America, upon an errand so&#xD;
derogatory to human dignity and virtue, as the foul&#xD;
persecution of a woman without father or brother to&#xD;
protect her, and the end of his career, in that cause,&#xD;
was not yet come. Let us hope it will be worthy of&#xD;
the cause in which he is engaged; or rather let him&#xD;
not be too successful in his undertakings, for the good&#xD;
of better people.&#xD;
Marion had been enjoying the luxury of quiet in an&#xD;
American family in New York, for several weeks.&#xD;
She was engaged in the capacity of governess, and&#xD;
her duties, by no means severe, had the effect to tran-&#xD;
quilhize her mind. Yet not until this tranquillity came&#xD;
did she realize what a strain there had been upon her&#xD;
nerves for years, nor what an effect their reaction&#xD;
was having upon her. Though she had hardly&#xD;
expected anything but defeat in her suit for the&#xD;
recovery of her property, under the circumstances,&#xD;
she found the disappointment greater than she had&#xD;
thought, in the beginning, it could be. It was true,&#xD;
she was not beaten; but she dreaded the mental&#xD;
effort of commencing and carrying through another&#xD;
prosecution againstt such opposition and prejudice as&#xD;
she would have to encounter. It was quite an every-&#xD;
&#xD;
day thing for her to be depressed in spirits now,&#xD;
when, for years, while really undergoiiig the se verest&#xD;
trials, she had maintained a brave spirit through all.&#xD;
This particular afternoon she felt unusually low in&#xD;
spirits. There seemed to be sonic tempest brewing in&#xD;
her mental atmosphere, of whose influences she was&#xD;
already made aware. To her inquiries as to the occa-&#xD;
sion of a crowd which she observed in the street,&#xD;
principally Irish, Mr. Sumner, her employer, in-&#xD;
formed her that there was a singular trial going on,&#xD;
in which the Irish took great interest. An Irish&#xD;
coachman had married the daughter of his employer,&#xD;
an Englishman of some rank and wealth, living near&#xD;
the city; and the father claimed his daughter's cus-.&#xD;
tody. The proud blood of the Englishman could not&#xD;
suffer such a degradation for a daughter of his. But&#xD;
the foolish old aristocrat had only reaped the reward&#xD;
of his own exclusive and Engli8h notions. His&#xD;
daughter had been excluded from the society of&#xD;
American young men, good enough for her alliance,&#xD;
because they were "only commoners;" and now she&#xD;
had failed in love with and married a curly-headed,&#xD;
quick-witted, handsome-looking Irishman, who drove&#xD;
her coach. Her husband had sued her father for her&#xD;
freedom, and all the Irish who had got news of the&#xD;
affair were up in arms, as they always are when any-&#xD;
thing pertaining to the rights of one of their nation&#xD;
is being discussed. There was considerable feeling,&#xD;
too, among the higher orders' of society, and the&#xD;
court-room had been crowded at the trial. The Eng-&#xD;
lishman evidently expected that his rank was going&#xD;
to do him service in the suit' and ii nota&#xD;

sympathy from American would-be aristocrats, of&#xD;
whom there arc vast numbers, after all the boast-&#xD;
sing of the democratic character of the people. But,&#xD;
American law makes no distinction in their favor,&#xD;
thank Heaven! however much justice there was in&#xD;
the father's proud unwillingness to consent to this&#xD;
union, unsuitable as it certainly was, there could be&#xD;
no appeal from common justice on account of indi-&#xD;
vidual errors or interests. The lawyer for the plain-&#xD;
tiff made no pretence at a plea. He merely told the&#xD;
judge here was the evidence, and asked for his&#xD;
decision. The judge read some passages of American&#xD;
law with regard to the relation of parents and child-&#xD;
ren, and also concerning the marriage relation;&#xD;
after which he ordered his wife to be delivered up to&#xD;
her husband. He gave the husband some good&#xD;
advice as well; and then took him in his carriage to&#xD;
get him through the cro~vd of eager Irish who were&#xD;
anxious to congratulate him, to a hotel where ordered&#xD;
to bring the lady of a coachman. While Mr. Sum-&#xD;
ner was relating this romantic affair, Marion, who&#xD;
was gazing out of the window, was struck by some-&#xD;
thing familiar in the air of a gentleman passing along&#xD;
the street, and observed that he stopped to ask a&#xD;
question of the servant, who was learning over the&#xD;
area railing after the fashion of servants. "Quick 1"&#xD;
exclaimed Marion, beckoning to Mr. Sumner; "and&#xD;
tell me who this is, if you can.~'&#xD;
"I cannot tell you who it is, that I know of; but&#xD;
your old friend, Tom McLain could, I think; as I&#xD;
heard him saying to his father: 'there is that damned&#xD;
rascal again.'"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        323&#xD;
&#xD;
"It is Elia !" shrieked Marion, and fell fainting upon&#xD;
the floor. The sudden apparition of this scoundrel in&#xD;
New York, when she had been fancying herself quite&#xD;
secure and at ease for the present, entirely banished&#xD;
what little fortitude and courage remained in her&#xD;
heart. She knew nothing but the most deadly and&#xD;
insatiable enmity could have prompted him thus to&#xD;
persevere in hunting down a woman who he felt sure&#xD;
would never marry him, even if she never had cared&#xD;
for another. If once he had wanted her for her pro-&#xD;
perty, he now pursued her to revenge himself upon&#xD;
her for past slights for indignities put upon him on&#xD;
her account, and to gratify a propensity to evil which&#xD;
was rooted in his nature.&#xD;
Mr. Sumner was alarmed for her, though he did&#xD;
not believe she was really unsafe in the midst of re-&#xD;
spectable society; still, there was something to make&#xD;
one nervous in knowing that a secret and remorse-&#xD;
less power was at work for the injury of any human&#xD;
being in any place. However, he promised her pro-&#xD;
tection: and the benefits of the law, of which he was&#xD;
an advocate, and in some degree succeeded in reas-&#xD;
suring her. Marion wished him to arm himself; but&#xD;
that seemed cowardly in his own quiet community;&#xD;
and as he had no fears of open outrage either for her&#xD;
or himself, he considered it useless.&#xD;
Time passed on without any marked event taking&#xD;
place. Then letters began to come to Mr. Sumner of&#xD;
an abusive and threatening kind, and throwing out&#xD;
dark insinuations against Miss Cunningham. The&#xD;
servant girl behaved in a manner as she never had&#xD;
before, toward the governess, half suspicious and half&#xD;

as if conscious of some guilt in herself. Marion knew&#xD;
nothing positively, but the secret influences about&#xD;
her seemed to smother her, like the air before a thun-&#xD;
der-storm. Her nervous weakness increased alarm&#xD;
ingly until she was thought to be in a consumption.&#xD;
In the meantime, Mrs. Sumner had been watching&#xD;
her with interest, and had come to the conclusion that&#xD;
it was time some active means were taken to discover&#xD;
the mystery which was killing her. About this time&#xD;
Marion received a letter from some unknown person&#xD;
threatening and accusing her in terms of the most&#xD;
slanderous import. This letter she immediately laid&#xD;
before her employers, who then confessed they had&#xD;
received letters from the same source. This was sur-&#xD;
prising news to Marion, as no mention had ever been&#xD;
made of them: and the mutual confidence brought&#xD;
about a consultation on the present position of affairs.&#xD;
Marion wished to see the Fowlers, as she thought they&#xD;
might find out something about Elia, who, she was&#xD;
confident, was still in New York. But Mr. Sumner&#xD;
thought that the fewer persons who were admitted to&#xD;
her counsel the better, if she wished to keep out of&#xD;
Elia's knowledge. Marion, however, felt certain that&#xD;
her enemy knew where she was and only waited an&#xD;
opportunity to surprise her, which was somewhat dif-&#xD;
ficult to find, as both her illness and her fears con-&#xD;
fined her to the house. Mr. Sumner did not think a&#xD;
man could be' such a fool as to be lurking around his&#xD;
house, intending to molest any member of his family:&#xD;
a practice which in New York would be rather dan-&#xD;
gerous.&#xD;
While they were still discussing the matter, and&#xD;
&#xD;
tears of anxiety were falling on the cheeks of the in-&#xD;
valid, which were answered by sympathizing drops&#xD;
in Mrs. Sumner's eyes, Mary the servant girl came&#xD;
into the room, bonneted and shawled, her face swol-&#xD;
len with weeping, and holding in her hand a bundle&#xD;
of clothing.&#xD;
"Why, Mary, what does this mean ~" cried her&#xD;
mistress, as the children came in, lamenting that Mary&#xD;
was going away. But Mary only wept the more, and&#xD;
could not answer distinctly to explain her sudden re-&#xD;
solution. The girl had been in the family several&#xD;
years, and was considered one of their number; there-&#xD;
fore her conduct was inexplicable. Mr. Sumner was&#xD;
somewhat vexed with her for what he considered a&#xD;
mere freak; and said somewhat coldly: "Well, Mary,&#xD;
when you see the foolishness of your conduct, come&#xD;
back, and Mrs. Sumner will still be a mother to you,&#xD;
as she has been." At this mild reproof, Mary's Irish&#xD;
heart was quite broken, and she sobbed louder than&#xD;
ever. After she had cried herself somewhat quiet&#xD;
Mrs. Sumner again asked her what she meant by&#xD;
going away.&#xD;
"It's not the likes of ye I ever expect to find,~~&#xD;
answered Mary; "but shure if I should stay"-and&#xD;
here she broke down again.&#xD;
"What in the name of heaven ails her, wife ?" broke&#xD;
forth the lawyer. But he was not without a suspi-&#xD;
cion of the trouble, and so gave Marion a sign to retire&#xD;
'ni the room. When Marion was gone, Mr. Sum-&#xD;
ner sat down by Mary and kindly taking her hand,&#xD;
said: "Mary, if you have any trouble, it is our pri-&#xD;
vilege to know it, as we take an interest in your wel-&#xD;

fare. Or, if we have in any way offended you, it is&#xD;
still your duty to explain, as you caniyot help know-&#xD;
ing we have not meant to be unkind to you." Still&#xD;
Mary was unable to make her confession. At last&#xD;
Mr. Sumner said: "If it is a secret matter, Mary, you&#xD;
can confide it to me as an attorney, without any fear&#xD;
of its being betrayed; for attorneys are obliged to&#xD;
keep the secrets of their clients." At that declaration&#xD;
Mary's mind was set at ease. An attorney was like&#xD;
a priest, and she might confide in him. Mrs. Sumner&#xD;
followed Marion, and then the truth came out. She&#xD;
had been solicited and urged by an old-country gen-&#xD;
tleman to convey him to Miss Cunningham's room&#xD;
secretly. He had offered her twenty pounds sterling&#xD;
if she would introduce him privately to Miss Cun-&#xD;
ningham's room, at such time as the family would&#xD;
know nothing of it.&#xD;
"But Mary, if you did not wish to do this, why&#xD;
should you be distressed about it ?"&#xD;
"Och, God bless you, the money will hire some-&#xD;
body, and troth there is English girls and boys try-&#xD;
ing to be great with me, and sure any one might get&#xD;
the plan of the house in that way, and get into it&#xD;
without my help, and so I thought I'd better go&#xD;
away than be the means of bringing this trouble&#xD;
upon yees and Miss Cunningham, the poor young&#xD;
lady.~~&#xD;
"Very well, Mary, I am glad I was here to pre-&#xD;
vent your going ~" said Mr. Summer. "Don't you&#xD;
see that if you go away I may be in danger of&#xD;
hiring some of these designing persons in your place.&#xD;
All you will have to do, 715 to remain, and keep quiet,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
327T&#xD;
&#xD;
and when something more turns up about this busi-&#xD;
ness, or anything suspicious happens, just come to me&#xD;
about it privately, and I will attend to the matter&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"It's an Irishman they call him," said Mary; "but&#xD;
I hear he was born in a bed of honor in London, bad&#xD;
luck to him!"&#xD;
"Miss Cunningham i&amp;amp; Irish, though ;" laughed Mr.&#xD;
Sumner; "and is not ashamed of her birth either,&#xD;
so you just return to your duties quietly, and we&#xD;
will see about this Englishman getting into her&#xD;
room."&#xD;
Three weeks passed, and Mary was happily re-&#xD;
stored to her former peace of mind and regular habits.&#xD;
But upon the evening of which we write there was&#xD;
an air over Mi'. Sumner's household of serious por-&#xD;
tent. Marion had on her hat and shawl for a walk,&#xD;
for the first time in a good many weeks. But she&#xD;
trembled so violently that there was danger she&#xD;
would not be able to fulfill her intention. "Come,&#xD;
come! this will never do," chided her friends; "you&#xD;
must do your part better than this, Or we shall not&#xD;
succeed. Rouse up your resolution, and allow your-&#xD;
self to be the humble instrument in the hands of&#xD;
God and your friends, of securing a great scoundrel&#xD;
for the hands of the law."&#xD;
"Oh, I ca~mnot," cried Marion, sinking upon her&#xD;
chair. "If I should see him, I should faint away in&#xD;
the street."&#xD;
"No you wouldn't. You would smile to think&#xD;
how short a time the rascal had to run at large.&#xD;
Never fear, Mrs. Sumner will take care of you when&#xD;

&#xD;
you come back, and reward you for being such a&#xD;
good girl."&#xD;
Thus encouraged, Marion started upon her walk.&#xD;
Up and down Broadway and the principal streets,&#xD;
she sauntered with a careless air, as if enjoying the&#xD;
exercise, but seci'etly with the disagreeable conscious-&#xD;
nc~ss of one playing a part, and at last, becoming so&#xD;
bewildered as hardly to know the way home, which&#xD;
she reached quite overcome with fatigue and excite-&#xD;
ment. But friendly hands helped off her street gar-&#xD;
ments, and brought refreshments. to restore her&#xD;
strength. Nothing more was said about the occasion&#xD;
of her late effort, which indeed she did not yet per-&#xD;
fectly understand, as the calculating reserve of this&#xD;
New England family only allowed her as much&#xD;
insight into their plans as was for her benefit. It is&#xD;
hard for a person of impulsive and ardent tempera-&#xD;
ment to submit him or herself to the direction of the&#xD;
cool and calculating; yet this was what was required&#xD;
of Marion, and it proved a benefit to her in the&#xD;
result. That night, when the family were assembled&#xD;
for prayer, an unusual solemnity seemed to be felt in~*&#xD;
the devotion of its members, and after singing&#xD;
"Jesus, lover of my soul," the good old grandmother&#xD;
of eighty years commended all, especially those in&#xD;
trouble, to the care of the father of us all, with more&#xD;
than common fervor. Catholic Mary, though for&#xD;
bidden by her spiritual teachers to mingle in Pro-&#xD;
testant devotions, could not refrain from silently&#xD;
kneeling and listening on this occasion.&#xD;
Sleep at length closed Marion's eyes, and qtiiet&#xD;
reigned throughout the house. Midnight approached&#xD;
&#xD;
arid a gentle rappilig upon the kitchen door gave the&#xD;
signal to some one within that entrance was desired.&#xD;
Carefully Mary unfastened the door and admitted a&#xD;
stranger. "Lead me to her," he said, making a sign&#xD;
to three others to remain where they were.&#xD;
"Och, sure, an' me heart fails me entirely," whis-&#xD;
pered Mary, who really trembled with emotion.&#xD;
"Fool I" hissed the man whose disguise hid his fea-&#xD;
tures, giving her a rough shake of the shoulder,&#xD;
"proceed, I say I"&#xD;
Mary suppressed a shriek, and reluctantly went on&#xD;
before to the chamber, in a wing of the building,&#xD;
which she pointed out as Miss Cunningham's room.&#xD;
Here, giving him a key she left him, promising to&#xD;
leave open all the doors in the passage back to the&#xD;
kitchen, and to let in his followers at the least&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
The key turned in the lock, and the kidnapper&#xD;
entered. Producing a faint light, he laid his pistols&#xD;
on a table to have them in readiness, and proceeded&#xD;
to inspect the apartment. As yet the occupant had&#xD;
not been awakened. He looked at her writing-table&#xD;
on which were some pictures by her friends and some&#xD;
half-written letters to some persons abroad. One of&#xD;
these names he recognized, and it added nothing to his&#xD;
good disposition toward his victim. After pocketing&#xD;
such papers as he selected, lie approached tho bed,&#xD;
gazed at the half-concealed face of the sleeper by&#xD;
the dim light, and then bending down he whispered her&#xD;
name softly several times, at the same time holding his&#xD;
hand close to her ~iead, ready to suppress any exclama-&#xD;
tion of surprise. The sleeper at length awakened with&#xD;

a start which caused the hand to come down over the&#xD;
mouth.&#xD;
"I have you at last," he whispered hoarsely.&#xD;
"Accursed daughter of a meddlesome father; you&#xD;
are mine-mine-do you hear! Arise, and dress your-&#xD;
self' in perfect sileiice, or I xviii blow out your.&#xD;
brains "-stretching one hand toward the pistols. "If&#xD;
you come quietly I promise you tolerable treatment;&#xD;
but it will not answer for you to resist me now."&#xD;
The poor victim shrunk and cowered under the&#xD;
clothes, without attempting to utter a word or cry.&#xD;
"Come," said the kidnapper, "I give you five&#xD;
minutes, at the longest-and not one sound above&#xD;
your breath. Here, I'll hold my pistol while you&#xD;
dress yourself." Cowering down, as if still reluctant,&#xD;
the inmate of the bed gathered up the coverlet and&#xD;
in an instant dashed it over the head of' the ruffian,&#xD;
and jumping upon him threw hiini to the floor. His&#xD;
pistol was discharged in the fall, which caused him&#xD;
to cry out that he was shot, as indeed he was. The&#xD;
noise of the report, and the stentorian lungs of&#xD;
Thomas iMicLain-for this was the name of the gentle&#xD;
sleeper-speedily gathered a crowd upon the spot,&#xD;
among whom were the three accomplices of the van-&#xD;
quished lord, who, not apprehending any such recep-&#xD;
tion, had rushed to his assistance on the first alarm.&#xD;
So well had the plot been laid, that enough were on&#xD;
the premises to secure the whole party of kidnappers.&#xD;
Kot even a surgeon was lacking-but he had been&#xD;
secured for Marion, who it was feared might be seized&#xD;
with hemorrhage of the lungs, upon any fright-and&#xD;
the wound of Lord Charles Ehia, kidnapper, was&#xD;

dressed upon the spot. It proved to be of rather a sen-&#xD;
otis character, but did not prevent the officers from&#xD;
taking him to a place of confinement, and placing&#xD;
him in a solitary apartment. his accomplices shared&#xD;
his punishment, but not his room, though lie entreated&#xD;
that one or more of them might be left with him.&#xD;
his chao'nin was excessive, insomuch lie tried to pre-&#xD;
b&#xD;
vent the dressing' of his wound, and declared his&#xD;
intention of bleeding to death.&#xD;
Thomas MeLain, who, upon reflection, Mr. Sum-&#xD;
ner had concluded to take into his plot, was rejoiced&#xD;
at the capture of this notorious villain, toward whom&#xD;
he owed so old u grudge; yet who was inadvertently&#xD;
the cause of his finding a good wife, who turned out&#xD;
to be a lady of family and property. Since their&#xD;
emigration to the United States, the Fowlers had&#xD;
enjoyed uninterrupted happiness and prosperity, and,&#xD;
aided by his father-in-law's endeavors, McLain had&#xD;
come to be quite an intelligent and noble man.&#xD;
Marion found him a good friend, and his family&#xD;
pleasant acquaintances; and the fact that lie had&#xD;
once been steward in the Elia family did not affect&#xD;
his worth in her eyes. It appeared to give him a&#xD;
slightly malicious pleasure, however, to offer his ser-&#xD;
vices to his lordship again, and have them declined in&#xD;
such a bitter way.&#xD;
The vexation which Elia suffered induced fever,&#xD;
and lie was removed to the hospital for treatment,&#xD;
where he remained some time, getting now better,&#xD;
now worse, as his feelings influenced him. Several&#xD;
attempts at suicide were frustra ted by his careful&#xD;
attendants, and the miserable man com~-~pelled to live&#xD;

&#xD;
whether lie would or not. He was by no means&#xD;
neglected by the good people of Ne~v York, and the&#xD;
clergy took a praiseworthy interest in him-doubtless&#xD;
because he was a "miserable sinner." This atten-&#xD;
tion from the religious portion of the community&#xD;
gave Elia some encouragement to live. 1k grew&#xD;
penitent, and confessed his sins; ackno~vledging that&#xD;
he had done wickedly, and wished to be forgiven.&#xD;
He even solicited an interview with Miss Cunning-&#xD;
ham, that he might ask her to pardon him.&#xD;
Marion was foolishly compassionate upon hearing&#xD;
of his rumored repentance, and would have granted&#xD;
his request but for the advice of Mr. Sumner, who&#xD;
gave it as his opinion that a man of his character&#xD;
would have to go through a good deal of purifica-&#xD;
tion before he was fit to have an interview with a&#xD;
lady of refined feelings. But, he called upon his&#xD;
lordship and informed him that Miss Cunningham's&#xD;
forgiveness would be extended to him upon terms&#xD;
which she would make known to him in writing. As&#xD;
Elia Slould guess ~vhat those terms would be, he was&#xD;
not nimch pleased with the offer of pardon on these&#xD;
grounds, and complained of the want of condescension&#xD;
on the part of Miss Cunningham, so as to enlist con-&#xD;
siderable sympathy in his favor from t~hat thoughtless&#xD;
portion of humanity, who are ready to run after&#xD;
every excitement and believe in every extravagant&#xD;
profession. The religious friends of the penitent lord&#xD;
chided Mr. Sumner for his uncharitableness, and the&#xD;
British consul called upon him to persuade him into&#xD;
more consideration for a "wild young man," who&#xD;
was old enough to be Marion's godfather! But Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sumner was firm amid reserved. Tile was waiting for&#xD;
further proof of reform befom;e he made a simpleton&#xD;
of himself, and another of Miss Cunningham, by lis-&#xD;
tening to all this persuasion, which he suspected was&#xD;
for the benefit of the lord and not the man.&#xD;
In the meantime, Marion was greatly improved in&#xD;
health and spirits, from the relief afforded by the&#xD;
arrest of Elia, as well as from the proofs of friend-&#xD;
ship which she received. She was under infinite&#xD;
obligations to Mr. Sumner's good feelings and good&#xD;
sense. It was just the kind of protection she needed,&#xD;
and did much to restore her sinking faith in an over-&#xD;
ruling Providence, which does not suffer vice to&#xD;
triumph forever over virtue. Her Written terms of&#xD;
pardon were at length conveyed to his lordship,&#xD;
demanding that he should not only reveal where&#xD;
John Woods was imprisoned, but take measures for&#xD;
his release; and promising that wheft Woods should&#xD;
have reached New York, the prosecution should dis-&#xD;
appear and he should go at liberty. The document&#xD;
was carefully prepared, and contained nothing which&#xD;
a penitent might not readily consent to; but, this&#xD;
sinner demurred, declaring it out of his power to fiml-&#xD;
fill such an agreement. Mr. Sumner then quietly&#xD;
withdrew the proposition, and waited for his re-&#xD;
covery.&#xD;
To add to the torture of the sick mali, his wife, who,&#xD;
it will be remembered, be married under circum-&#xD;
stances of great singularity, made her appearance on&#xD;
the stage. She had been informed, by some mis-&#xD;
chievous person, that it was his desire to see her; and&#xD;
was very much put out by the reception he gave her,&#xD;

which was anything but amiable or Christian. his&#xD;
auger and annoyance again seriously retarded his&#xD;
recovery, while his wife went back to her farm, very&#xD;
much dejected. It then began to be said, by his&#xD;
officious champions, that, owing to an accident&#xD;
received in his childhood, he was not of sound sense:&#xD;
~. e., that he was foolish, and therefore not charge-&#xD;
able with crime! The actions of the patient had&#xD;
given ground enough for such a supposition, it was&#xD;
true; but, had Elia been well and able to defend&#xD;
himself, it is presumed he would have rejected that&#xD;
apology for his conduct. The patronage he received&#xD;
from clergymen misled Elia to suppose that he was&#xD;
the subject of their favors in a greater degree than&#xD;
in merely spiritual affairs. lIe hoped they had some-&#xD;
thing of the power they would have had in Ireland&#xD;
of extricating him from his difficulties. His disap-&#xD;
pointment was very great, to find himself, as soon as&#xD;
lie was comfortably recovered, remanded to a prison&#xD;
instead of on his way to Ir'eland, where lie was re-&#xD;
solved to remain for the future. After what he had&#xD;
witnessed in the case of the Irish coachman, he had&#xD;
no disposition to appear before an American tribunal,&#xD;
to answer to the charge of abducting or trying to&#xD;
abduct, a young lady. lie found it munch against&#xD;
his taste to be tried in a common court, without the&#xD;
1i'i~~ilege of a jury of his peers. In truth, Democracy&#xD;
was a bitter pill to the vicious and self-indulgent scion&#xD;
of nobility. Ample opportunity lie had to consider&#xD;
the differences in politics of the two countries before&#xD;
a chance was given him to reconsider Marion's pro-&#xD;
position concerning John Woods. But, when it was&#xD;

Woods set at liberty: an undertaking which was&#xD;
really not very easy, after all, there being others&#xD;
concerned in the ease beside Lord Charles. The 01(1&#xD;
lord, who had been less culpable in the matter than&#xD;
his son, knew not how to manage the parties most to&#xD;
blame without offending them. It was a subject&#xD;
requiring management to introduce: and he knew&#xD;
how little hope there was of an Englishman ever&#xD;
Vepenting of a sin in anything like a wholc.s~uled,&#xD;
voluntary way.&#xD;
But, lie bethought himself, at last, that it was pos-&#xD;
sible lie might persuade the bishop to procure&#xD;
Wood's release, if lie could make it appeal' that in&#xD;
that way he could annoy Lady Fre~ilonia; hinting,&#xD;
at the same time, that, as her ladyship' was so&#xD;
opposed to Marion's connection with him, it was very&#xD;
pi'obable she would withhold Marion's property, and&#xD;
contrive to precut her claim being recognized, if&#xD;
she was sane enough to oppose it; or even it might&#xD;
l)e that, if Marion could be restored to Woods in the&#xD;
United States, she might never attempt to recover&#xD;
her property, but be glad to settle down to a la-&#xD;
borious life befittimig her husband and the country of&#xD;
her adoption.&#xD;
This kind of argument failed to convince the&#xD;
bishop; who had an idea that Marion was among time&#xD;
very people who would assist her all they could; and,&#xD;

&#xD;
if she had John Woods, she would be more likely&#xD;
than ever to proyc tenacious of her rights. There-&#xD;
fore he declared his entire ignorance of the where-&#xD;
abouts of Woods, or that he had any knowledge&#xD;
whatever concerning him, and resented the insinua-&#xD;
tion as an insult. This threw Lord Elia into great&#xD;
consternation; for lie had relied upon the bishop's&#xD;
codperation more than any other.&#xD;
The next expedient was to try to procure an inter-&#xD;
view between Lady Elia and Lady Fredonia. In&#xD;
this he was successful, the bishop offering no opposi-&#xD;
tion. Her ladyship's case had received no more at-&#xD;
tention since the counnissioners had been "smoked&#xD;
out" so unceremoniously, by the prince of the lower&#xD;
regions; and, as she had refused to be diugged, she&#xD;
was in nearly the same state as formerly. So unusual&#xD;
a thing as a visit from a lady of her own rank, or in-&#xD;
deed from any but her attendants, was an era in the&#xD;
late life of Lady Fredonia: and it might have been a&#xD;
spectacle of interest to indifferent eyes-this meeting&#xD;
of the two ladies. Both had suffered much from not&#xD;
dissimilar causes, though in one case there was some&#xD;
cause to blame the sufferer for her own wrongs, in&#xD;
the other, none; for Lady Elia was a lovely Christian&#xD;
woman, though having little energy to overcome the&#xD;
injustice of her husband with the greater efforts of&#xD;
goodness.&#xD;
Lady Fredonia's apartment, as well as herself,&#xD;
shocked her old neighbor exceedingly. All IMile.&#xD;
IL's perfumery, recently scattered, coiled not take off&#xD;
the death-like smell of that dead and moldering air&#xD;
that had lain as still as the inmate for a time dreadful&#xD;
&#xD;
to contemplate, the gloom, and the emaciated Ufl(l (IC-&#xD;
jected appearance of Lady Fredonia so affected lady&#xD;
Elia that she could not restrain her tears. She saw at&#xD;
once that if Lady Fredonia had not been insane, it was&#xD;
not because she had not suffered enough to make her so.&#xD;
When Lady Elia made known the object of her&#xD;
visit, the penitent lady would gladly have aided her&#xD;
in the discovery of Woods, not only on account of&#xD;
Lord Charles-for whom, in her altered state of&#xD;
feeling, she had little regard-but, as an act of&#xD;
justice, and a means of happiness to her daughter.&#xD;
She was unable to do so, however', having so long&#xD;
been removed from all knowledge of his fate or any-&#xD;
thing pertaining to him. If he was not to be found&#xD;
in Dublin, she knew not where he was; and, as for&#xD;
aiding in his release, even if she knew by what&#xD;
enemies at present held, she had no longer means or&#xD;
influence to do so.&#xD;
Disappointed and dejected, Lady Elia took leave of&#xD;
the poor prisoner, as she had no doubt she was, and&#xD;
returned to the drawing-room, where she found high&#xD;
words passing between Lord Elia and the bishop.&#xD;
Sick of the world, which seemed to her to contain&#xD;
only sin and misery, Lady Elia drew her lord away&#xD;
and returned to her sorrowful home.&#xD;
The only child left her, if Charles was ruined by&#xD;
his American misdemeanors, was a younger son,&#xD;
whom the father nicknamed Pat, because his mother&#xD;
allowed him to be born in Ireland. This boy was an&#xD;
amiable, generous-hearted youth, who, from his re-&#xD;
semblace to his- mother, and being the younger son,&#xD;
got little affection from Lord Elia. The old lord's&#xD;

pride had always been in Charles; whose propensity&#xD;
for always getting into difficulties was looked upon&#xD;
as evidence of bravery and superior talent. But,&#xD;
the late disgrace, and the hopeless nature of his case&#xD;
as he represented it, somewhat changed the 01(1&#xD;
lord's views, and he began to attach some con-&#xD;
sequence to the neglected younger son, who, being&#xD;
now very ill, gave him some reason to fear he might&#xD;
yet be childless.&#xD;
Between his concern for Pat and his concern for&#xD;
Lord Charles, the impatient nobleman allowed him-&#xD;
self no rest. He was tempted to go to America and&#xD;
see what could be done in person; but he recollected&#xD;
that he was old, as well as of very irascible temper,&#xD;
and doubted the good he should be able to accom-&#xD;
plish by his presence. He felt much more like con-&#xD;
descending, to the Yankee lawyer and to Marion&#xD;
Cunningham, than he had ever thought it possihile to&#xD;
feel, lie would now be glad to make terms with&#xD;
them; but their terms were fixed, and lie had no&#xD;
means of keeping them fully and satisfactorily, with-&#xD;
out the codpcration of others; whh~h it now seemed&#xD;
impossible to secure. By turns he cursed the bishop&#xD;
for encouraging Charles to follow Marion then the&#xD;
Yankees for being such an independent set, requiring&#xD;
nothing but what was right, and submitting to&#xD;
nothing wrong!&#xD;
"Marion Cunningham," said the irate old lord,&#xD;
"might as web have been a saint on the plains of&#xD;
Paradise for all the chance Charles had of getting&#xD;
her away from the United States. Every upstart&#xD;

perfectly maddening; I feel like going as crazy as a&#xD;

Tinis the old nobleman stormed and fumed. One&#xD;
of his servants, who was not always quite sober, chanc-&#xD;
ing to notice the tenor of his remarks, took the liberty&#xD;
of replying that it was "asy to see what was the&#xD;
trouble with the English in America; shure the&#xD;
eagles picked out their eyes, that they couldn't see&#xD;
to take care of themselves-the American eagles&#xD;
were a bad plague, sure enough 1" Lord Elia was&#xD;
not in the habit of brooking any interference or&#xD;
remarks from his servants, yet now his restless humor&#xD;
made him for once willing to listen to anything that&#xD;
would divert his thoughts; so lie asked, rather tartly,&#xD;
"What do yozt know about the Yankees ?"&#xD;
"Och, and haven't I heard that the horrid crea-&#xD;

"How else would they breathe, you brute ?-hike&#xD;

put out by the insinuation.&#xD;
"You rascal! you shall drink 'a curse to all the&#xD;
enemies of England'in a glass of whisky, and shall&#xD;
swallow it with your mouth open, or i'll flog you&#xD;
soundly," cried his lordship, at the same time order-&#xD;

Tim was willing enough to make the experiment,&#xD;

&#xD;
as he thought he could" worry it down," in some way&#xD;
without choking. When he had returned with the&#xD;
whisky, he filled two glasses as his master directed,&#xD;
and lifting one was about to drink it off, when his mas-&#xD;
ter interrupted him. "Stop! you are to drink my&#xD;
toast-' A curse to all the enemies of England!"'&#xD;
"I wouldn't like to drink that, your honor, for&#xD;
shure I think it would take yourself to the bad&#xD;
place.~~&#xD;
"What do you mean, insolent !" shouted Lord Elia.&#xD;
"I begs your pardon, your honor; but it's a&#xD;
thought of old Tim's that the lords are not the best&#xD;
friends of England. Ye make slaves of her sons,&#xD;
and are slaves yourselves to the queen, as I'm a&#xD;
thinking."&#xD;
"You see through servants' eyes, sirrah! drink the&#xD;
toast, I say." Thus commanded, Tim swallowed the&#xD;
whisky and the sentiment, and contrived not to choke&#xD;
on either. As he sat down his glass, he made a low&#xD;
reverence and said: "It's much obliged I am to your&#xD;
lordship for the condescension, and if your honor&#xD;
would not take it amiss, Tim would like to tell what's&#xD;
on his mind about the young master."&#xD;
"Oh, hold your tongue, you blathering beast,&#xD;
don't speak to me of Lord Charles. Great is the fool&#xD;
he has made of himself" he added aside, in an angry&#xD;
whisper.&#xD;
"It's not presuming I would be, your lordship; but&#xD;
if you'll allow me to mention it, I think I know the&#xD;
way to bring the bishop round."&#xD;
"The devil! what do you know about the&#xD;
bishop ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"lVhy, you see, your honor, Jim the footman&#xD;
tould me you had some high words with his reverence&#xD;
about not wanting to tell where poor John Woods&#xD;
has gone to, and Jun and the butler and I talked it&#xD;
oVer, and old Tim isi~'t such a fool, your honor, but&#xD;
he has some wit left to serve his master with yet."&#xD;
"Well, sirrah, proceed."&#xD;
"Let me bring your lordship some more liquor&#xD;
first, if ye plase; it's a long story and may tire your&#xD;
honor's patience unless ye have the blessed drink to&#xD;
get up the heart of ye ;" and Tini made a profound&#xD;
bow.&#xD;
"Get out, then, you drunken rascal, and get ano-&#xD;
ther drink, as I see that is what you want, and be&#xD;
back here in a trice."&#xD;
"Yes, your honor," bowed Tim, and sped away&#xD;
with the lightness of a boy to find the butler. "his&#xD;
loAlship is getting to be the devil of a good Christ-&#xD;
ian," said he to that official.&#xD;
"Och, bad luck to your blarney, Tim," answered&#xD;
the butler, "it would be as aisy for the ot~tld one to&#xD;
repaint as hi~ lordship. It is fear that ails him,&#xD;
indade."&#xD;
"Thrue for you," said Tim; "but it's the like of this&#xD;
day I never expected to see. His lordship will let&#xD;
mc advise hhn, and shure I'll advise him for his good.&#xD;
Tim's a broth of a boy-you'll see, Mr. Butler."&#xD;
After 'gossiping awhile with the butler, and getting&#xD;
into a proper state of confidence by means ~of the&#xD;
"blessed drink," Tim returned to his master, who&#xD;
had made up his mind to listen to Tim's suggestions,&#xD;
in the l1ol)e that he b row a little light on the&#xD;

subject nearest his heart. He was too indignant,&#xD;
however, at having to take advice from a servant, to&#xD;
endure Tim's complacent manner, and began by&#xD;
striking Tim with a whip to remind him of his posi-&#xD;
tion-an act which Tim forgave, knowing his master&#xD;
was not practiced in the art of condescension, and&#xD;
ought to have allowances made for any slight mistake&#xD;
he might make in the attempt.&#xD;
"What have you to propose, Tim ?" asked Elia,&#xD;
after making this blunder. "I'll give you a farm if&#xD;
you can show me how to manage the bishop, as you&#xD;
say you can."&#xD;
"Well, your lordship, if you will just tell me to&#xD;
do the thing, it's all I ask, for I can do it," said Tim,&#xD;
bravely.&#xD;
"What do you propose-what do you want to&#xD;
do ?" asked Elia.&#xD;
"Why, thou, I only want your honor to get sick&#xD;
and send for the bishop to comfort your soul, and let&#xD;
old Tim wait on you, and he'll manage the rest,&#xD;
never fear. Don't trouble yourself about the busi-&#xD;
ness. You will have to be a little sick, and a little&#xD;
in fear of your soul, that is all your honor will have&#xD;
to do. about it. I'll make his riverence tell your lord-&#xD;
ship whatever you want to know, see if I don't! It's&#xD;
not fit that a bishop with 110 noble blood should fret&#xD;
the likes of yees."&#xD;
"Well, Tim, I shall be taken sick to-morrow ; and&#xD;
mind you don't get me into any awkward scrapes;&#xD;
if you do, I'll flog you to death, by the heavens!&#xD;
Now, just take the management, since you want it&#xD;
so much, and mind you manage well."&#xD;

Accordingly, tile old lord was taken ill the next&#xD;

or those who do not labor, have rather a hard time in&#xD;

my dears, I am sorry to inform you your time for con-&#xD;
sidering the matter is short. Whatever you have to&#xD;

all, I advise von to confess to one another what you&#xD;
have done for my cause during the last few years.&#xD;
i'll just sit by and keep a reckoning ;" and the smoke&#xD;
of brimstone issued from his mouth as lie whisked&#xD;
into a chair.&#xD;
Old Tim rolled groaning on the floor, while hi~&#xD;
master set up in bed with a ghastly expression of&#xD;
fear upon his countenance. The bishop's teeth chat.&#xD;
tered and his lips were ashen pale. His Satanic Ma-&#xD;
jesty seemed to enjoy the consternation of the party&#xD;
very much. "ha, ha, ha!" laughed he, with a loud&#xD;
snort, "my people like mc better in the distance than&#xD;
close by. But come now, give the devil his due.&#xD;
You cannot say but I am a very good sort of master.&#xD;
I have given you all long lives and plenty of this&#xD;
world's goods. But, to confess the truth, which I&#xD;
never like to do, about this matter, there is still a&#xD;
greater master than I am, and to him I must account&#xD;
for my success in gaining followers. Come, begin;&#xD;

master has consented to take sides with her, and we&#xD;
are all beaten. Eli, bi~liop, what is the name of his&#xD;
last prison? You don't like to talk ~vith me, it seems.&#xD;
Very well, "if you don't answer me respectfully now,&#xD;
the time will come when YOU will be glad to." An-&#xD;
other snort, and an uneasy movement of the cloven&#xD;
feet. The bishop Was gasping for breath. lie cvi-&#xD;
Uently wished to speak, but could not. At last he&#xD;
uttered, with a sort of groan, the following question:&#xD;
"How much time will I gain if I confess and repent?"&#xD;
"Bali! I don't want ~,ou to REPENT. If you con-&#xD;
fess, you may gain one year of time. Confession&#xD;
stands confoundedly in my way; but after all, it is al-&#xD;
lowed to some of my followers to benefit themselves&#xD;
by it."&#xD;
"Must I confess to-to you?" gasped the bishop.&#xD;
"No, not to me. You and Elia there talk it over&#xD;
with one another while I take notes for judgment.&#xD;
Quick! I must soon be gone, and shall not call again&#xD;
until you have repaid my visit. Even the devil has&#xD;
some manners."&#xD;
The bishop began rapidly to run over the most enor-&#xD;
mous of his sins with trembling lips and quivering&#xD;
chin; and Elia laid muttering and occasionally sneez-&#xD;
ing as the smoke stimulated his nostrils too much for&#xD;
endurance. None of the trio of worthies who were&#xD;
honored by this visit retained self-possession enough&#xD;
to undertake to investigate the reality of thejr visitor's&#xD;
character-so true is it that "conscience doth make&#xD;
cowards of us all."&#xD;
Presently the bishop ceased his jmnbhing confes-&#xD;

sion ,and amidst a more intense cloud of smoke the&#xD;
horned head vanished; though, whether ~through the&#xD;
door, or ceiling, or floor, the company c~uld not tell.&#xD;
Thu was the first to recover his self-possession.&#xD;
lie hastened to pour over himself some holy water,&#xD;
and mutter prayers in irreverent haste. His master&#xD;
and the bishop, not having faith in the power of holy&#xD;
water, had no such easy purification. The weight&#xD;
upon their consciences was not so soon disposed of.&#xD;
As soon, however, as the air cleared up a little from&#xD;
Tim's opening a window, and they found themselves&#xD;
really unharmed, Elia called for wine, the nourish-&#xD;
ment of which gave them strength to contemplate&#xD;
their dreadful situation. Elia had never meant to go&#xD;
to hell~-he intended to repent when he got done sin-&#xD;
ning, and rat her thought that, in consequence of his&#xD;
great sins and necessary great repentance, he should&#xD;
be considered quite an acquisition by heaven, which&#xD;
ought to be proud of such a conquest. As for con-&#xD;
sulting the bishop, after what had just taken place,&#xD;
he feared it would not benefit him materially; still,&#xD;
he thought he might ask him a few leading questions&#xD;
as to the faith necessary unto salvation. The bishop,&#xD;
instead of being in the mood for rendering consolation&#xD;
to others, felt that he needed it himself. Of what use&#xD;
- to him was his commission from church or state?&#xD;
The devil could claim him, did claim him; and he&#xD;
feared one year more would terminate his chances of&#xD;
a final repentance, even if that was now possible.&#xD;
Inspired by that need of sympathy which cowards&#xD;
always feel, he recounted to Elia the private history&#xD;
of his life-a history which coming from a "man of&#xD;
&#xD;
God," made his hardened listener shudder. Elia en-&#xD;
treated him to take a Bible and look for some encou-&#xD;
raging passages for both of them: but the more he&#xD;
looked, the more the whole book seemed filled with&#xD;
promises to widows and orphans, to the poor and af-&#xD;
flicted, to the meek and lowly of heart.&#xD;
At last lie threw down the book in despair and sat&#xD;
in ~loomy defiance of the mandates of 1mea~ven. When&#xD;
a man is fully convinced lie shall nevem~ be any better,&#xD;
lie is always sure to become worse very rapidly. So&#xD;
the bishop took to proclaiming that he was not afraid&#xD;
of the devil and all his legions. Old Tim, who had&#xD;
been a witness of all this humiliating scene, now&#xD;
undertook to comfort his superiors; but his efforts&#xD;
were ludicrously wide of the point-so Inuch so, that&#xD;
his master became suddenly enraged and struck at&#xD;
him with his ever ready whip. No sooner had he&#xD;
recovered himself from this blow than another fol-&#xD;
lowed, and the old servant crouched on the floor.&#xD;
"-you, for your insolence 1" cried the enraged&#xD;
master; "I shall rule on earth if I have to - serve&#xD;
in h-."&#xD;
In an interlude of quiet, the bishop repeated:&#xD;
"We have done those things we ought not to have&#xD;
done; we have left undone these things which we ought&#xD;
to have done, and there is no health in us." But the&#xD;
words sounded like mockery in his cars, and the next&#xD;
instant lie had given way to actual blasphemy.&#xD;
In the midst of this confusion, a servant announced&#xD;
the queen's chancellor. Here was a new difficulty.&#xD;
What a state of things to which to admit such a wit-&#xD;
ness! Ehia's body servants were hastily summoned&#xD;

to put him in order to see guests of this quality, and&#xD;
rid him of the sulphurous~ smell which still clung to&#xD;
his clothing. The bishop could not well retreat with.-&#xD;
out meeting the chancellor; yet, he was in no fit con-&#xD;
dition either. He was sick, and could hardly stand&#xD;
to have his clothes well brushed and perfumed. He&#xD;
felt that at no other time could he have been so&#xD;
unwilling to meet the ILord Chancellor and the&#xD;
queen's commissioners, as he now was, in his present&#xD;
state of mind ; still, he knew that lie could not escape,&#xD;
for they would not leave Ireland without paying him&#xD;
a visit. He made the best of a very bad state of&#xD;
affairs, and paid his respects to Lord Elia's guests,&#xD;
before returning home.&#xD;
The bishop's appearance did not fail to excite&#xD;
remark. 'He was haggard and pale in the extreme,&#xD;
and not altogether free from that infernal odor which&#xD;
doubtless they had heard of his having had, on a&#xD;
former occasion. He did not fail to mark the sur-&#xD;
prise exhibited in their countenances, and it cut&#xD;
deeper and sharper than a sharp sword into his writh-&#xD;
ing nerves. Thoroughly disheartened and miserable,&#xD;
lie excused himself from joining JLord Elia's guests at&#xD;
dinner, and prepared to go home immediately.&#xD;
Would that lie could escape to the ends of the earth !&#xD;
but escape was now impossible.&#xD;
Just as he was about leaving, Lord Elia took him&#xD;
aside, to tell him that " all sin had broke loose in&#xD;
New York ; that their names were used with freedom&#xD;
in connection with the story of Marion Cunningham&#xD;
and his son, who was forever disgraced in the eyes&#xD;
of all those who were influenced by the Yankee&#xD;

&#xD;
nation. A perfect storm of curses were let loose on&#xD;
-the American people, Marion Cunninghami and Lord&#xD;
Charles. This was no comfort to the bishop. He&#xD;
thought of his own domestic affairs, and that in all&#xD;
likelihood the world soon would be discussing them&#xD;
openly. Alh, sooner than he dreamed ; for already&#xD;
it was indeed exulting over a precious new piece of&#xD;
gossip, furnished by himself.&#xD;
Elia called Newv York a city of refuge for the whole&#xD;
earth. "Except Africa," interrupted Fredonia, glad&#xD;
to find an exception.&#xD;
" Not even excepting her, if ever the spirit of eman-&#xD;
cipation gets ground there ; for not a nigger would&#xD;
remain in the British possessions, if he could choose&#xD;
the United States."&#xD;
"Well," sighed the bishop,. "I suppose God&#xD;
ordained this City of Refuge, as you call it, from the&#xD;
beginning of the world. It seems to be needed by&#xD;
the many that flock to it from all Christendom and&#xD;
heathendom, too, for that matter."&#xD;
"It is very queer lie should have chosen such&#xD;
unbelieving men as Franklin, Jefferson, Alien and&#xD;
others to do his work in establishing this retreat for&#xD;
the world," remarked Elia, sarcastically. "They&#xD;
were infidels of the deepest dye."&#xD;
" Not so remarkably singular, either," answered&#xD;
Fredonia, with bitterness. " England might have&#xD;
established herself on the rock of Christ ; but, instead&#xD;
of that foundation, she has adopted an immense&#xD;
spiritual humbug, which all candid men can see, and&#xD;
many are made infidels by it. What Christ himself&#xD;
would have denounced, we are required to believe&#xD;

and practise. The essence and pith of our doctrine&#xD;
is to believe such things as are for the temporal and&#xD;
pecuniary interests of the Church. Yes, truly, we&#xD;
ought to be proud of the head and founder of the&#xD;
Church of England-the virtuous and pious henry&#xD;
the Eighth, who continually bowed down, not to his&#xD;
God, but his mistresses."&#xD;
"You utter treason," said Elia.&#xD;
"Don't be alarmed for me," sneered Fredonia,&#xD;
"nor look on me with horror, because I know the&#xD;
truth. It is knowing the truth and not living it, that&#xD;
has sold me to the devil. What sort of archbishop&#xD;
did the supreme head of the Church first ordain?&#xD;
The qualifications he had are not those found in the&#xD;
House of Lords of England. Men will hate me, and&#xD;
be horrified at my wickedness, because I have failed&#xD;
to cherish my wife; but I am no worse than my&#xD;
peers.~~&#xD;
Elia was not flattered by this last remark. lie&#xD;
roared at the bishop like a lion, and swore furiously&#xD;
that he was a miserable traitor, whose talk he would&#xD;
not endure.&#xD;
"You may try me," answered Fredonia, coolly,&#xD;
"by the statutes of the old Saint Henry VIII.&#xD;
He is the standard of morals with lords und church-&#xD;
men."&#xD;
"Son of the' Infernal I" cried Elia, wrathfully,&#xD;
"have you no respect for God nor the queen ?" lie&#xD;
laid his hand heavily on the bishop's shoulder, as if&#xD;
he would like to tear him.&#xD;
"Be quiet, my ln'otlier," said Fredonia, smiling&#xD;
sarcastically; "and don't fall out with your father's&#xD;

son. Meantime, farewell !" and he slowlydeparted&#xD;
from the house, where confusion reigned, to make his&#xD;
own a scene no less revolting. As he went toward&#xD;
home, he leaned wearily in the corner of his carriage&#xD;
and tried to think clearly of his situation. Should&#xD;
he turn Catholic? He had a mind to; it would give&#xD;
him a chance to retire from the word's scornful laugh&#xD;
or condemnation. Beside, men just as intellectual as&#xD;
himself believed the pope could defy the devil, or&#xD;
even break a contract with one. Why not avail&#xD;
himself of the belief? He should be no worse off-&#xD;
he might be better. Why had he allowed the greed&#xD;
of gain to betray him into the snares of Satan?&#xD;
Was tIme "harvest past and the summer ended" for.&#xD;

-CHAPTER XXVII'.&#xD;
WHN~ the bishop reached home, he found IMlle.&#xD;
N- all smiles to receive him; but her countenance&#xD;
looked ineffably hideous to him. -Her graceful and&#xD;
supple movements filled him with horror like the-&#xD;
crawling of a snake. Her black eyes glittered like&#xD;
unholy fires, and her voice filled him with aversion.&#xD;
Perhaps she never had appeared to him so truly as she&#xD;
did at that moment, when he was heated with a ter-&#xD;
rible fever of heart and brain. She wished to minis-&#xD;
ter to him, perceiving his condition ; but he would&#xD;
not allow her to come near him. " Despair, like a&#xD;
strong man armed " had possession of him. Heaven&#xD;
seemed closed ; earth undesirable ; hell yawning&#xD;
before him.&#xD;
It soon became apparent to the household that he&#xD;
was suffering from a brain fever; and,' as his ravings&#xD;
were of a nature to bring reproach upon him, it was&#xD;
thought best to keep him as secluded as possible.&#xD;
But his sins had found him out, and his "refuges of&#xD;
lies " were being swept away. The perversity with&#xD;
which he had misconstrued the Sci-iptures all his&#xD;
life came upon him now, to his own destruction'.&#xD;
Foolish man ! that had studiously endeavored to&#xD;
impose upon his own judgment, and refused to be&#xD;
convinced of an error to which he could not shut his&#xD;
eyes. No longer could he have read with his former&#xD;
complacency: "As I live, saithm the Lord, I have no&#xD;

pleasure in the death of the wicked ;" nor have&#xD;
exulted in believing, " There is none that doetlh good.&#xD;
no, not one." Horrible visions tormented himi ; ter-&#xD;
rible expressions continually issued from his mouth.&#xD;
None of his heart secrets were safe with him now;-&#xD;
he painted them in all their worst deformity.&#xD;
Mile. N was distracted. The bishop accused&#xD;
her of all she was guilty of, and even more. There&#xD;
was no longer any concealment; for, although~ they&#xD;
were the ravings of a man in delirium, no one could&#xD;
doubt the truthfulness of his confession and accusation&#xD;
who knew of their possible relations toward each other.&#xD;
When not accusing himself or his paramour, the&#xD;
patient was giving evidence of such obscene or pro-&#xD;
fane toasts as he had often betrayed at dinners, among&#xD;
his peers.&#xD;
The Catholic churcii seemed to give him a great&#xD;
deal of uneasiness, beckoning him on, and then&#xD;
retreating. In vain he apologized for having drunk&#xD;
"to the pope in -, and the devil throwing priests&#xD;
at him -" the offended church would not be recon-&#xD;
ciled.&#xD;
By a singular coincidence, there were quite a num-&#xD;
ber of the Irish gentry in the north, at this time, and&#xD;
many in the immediate neighborhood of Lord Elia's&#xD;
estate, who presented themselves at his castle on&#xD;
business with the queen's chancellor. Among them&#xD;
was Lord Potter, and also the Lord. Lieutenant of&#xD;
Ireland, and his chancellor. The condition of Bishop&#xD;
SFredonia was a subject of interest and feeling among&#xD;
these, who were principally Protestants. The leaders&#xD;
of the church were much affected to hear that his&#xD;

As all the proper persons were there, it was suggest-&#xD;
ed that Lady Fredonia's case should now be attended&#xD;
to; and the chancellor go in person to visit her lady-&#xD;
ship. Dr. Wilkins, though not on good terms with the&#xD;
family, was chosen for his professional skill, and partly&#xD;
by the influence of Lord Potter, who had good reasons&#xD;
for desiring his attendance. The physician who&#xD;
usually attended the bishop was unable to procure&#xD;
him any abatement of the delirium, and Dr. Wilkins&#xD;
was desired to see the bishop, also.&#xD;
Before calling upon the sick man, the lords thought&#xD;
it best to send the doctor to administer some quiet-&#xD;
uig medicine; and, accordingly, he went, though&#xD;
with apparent reluctance. The outlaw reputation&#xD;
which the doctor had, made him but slow to attend&#xD;
upon those persons thronoim whom he had acquired&#xD;
such a name. No sooner did the bishop behold his&#xD;
new attendant, than he sprang up, shrieking an~&#xD;
bounding from the bed, caught the doctor by his&#xD;
throat, in a maniac manner quite startling, even to&#xD;
the old doctor's nerves. But his skill in managing&#xD;
such patients soon enabled him to get the bishop&#xD;
again upon the bed, where he quietly held him, look-&#xD;
ing him fairly in the eye until the insane spirit was&#xD;
subdued. Once subdued, the doctor proceeded to&#xD;
give him medicine, and warn him not to enact any&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
more of his extraordinary feats. Just as long as his&#xD;
conqueror was in the rooni, the sick man lay ~cr-&#xD;
feetly quiet; but no sooner did lie notice the doctor's&#xD;
absence, than he sprang again out of bed. Going to&#xD;
a little cabinet, he opened it, and seizing a vial, drank&#xD;
down the whole of its contents. The only servant in&#xD;
the apartment beholding the quick agony which&#xD;
took hold on hiu~, ran to look at the label, and found&#xD;
it read, Aqua fortis. He had swallowed a large&#xD;
quantity of the deadly stuff which had been kept for&#xD;
testing metals.&#xD;
A servant came running to find Dr. Wilkins, in&#xD;
all haste, and the doctor, inrigining his patient had&#xD;
escaped from them, cried out:&#xD;
"Where has he gone to, now&#xD;
Faith, doctor, he's gone, indeed !"&#xD;
"Where, where, you fool ?"&#xD;
"Och, doctor, I'm not a fool. The, bishop has&#xD;
swallowed some stuff thnt'll send him through 11111'-&#xD;
gatory to the other place, snapping and crackling."&#xD;
So much for the affection of those who serve vice&#xD;
and injustice!&#xD;
When Dr. Wilkins reached the sick-room, he saw&#xD;
the first part of the man's report confirmed; as for&#xD;
the other, lie did not wish to think or say. lie did&#xD;
not stop to mourn for the man who had willfully put&#xD;
off his mortality in so cowardly a manner; or, if not&#xD;
done in cowardice, in the madness brought on by his&#xD;
own consciousness of guilt.&#xD;
Not a servant in the house was willing to touch&#xD;
the dead man. They all had a superstition about&#xD;
suicides, that their souls never rest; and dared not&#xD;

come near the tenement so lately vacated by the&#xD;
doomed spirit. In three hours from the death of the&#xD;
bishop, not a servant remained except the old woman&#xD;
who waited upon Lady Fredonia, and the steward.&#xD;
Not for worlds would they venture to be found there&#xD;
after sundown, lest all the terrible things the deliri-&#xD;
ous brain had conjured up should appear to them.&#xD;
Dr. Wilkins gave orders that Lady Fredonia should&#xD;
be brought to the apartment where her dead husband&#xD;
lay. The scene w, a severe but sure test of&#xD;
her sanity. When the doctor gave this order, the&#xD;
steward respectfully suggested that the doctor should&#xD;
go in person, as he did not like to take the responsi-&#xD;
bility of removing her ladyship, under the present&#xD;
perplexing circumstances. This suggestion suiting the&#xD;
doctor's wishes, was instantly complied with. Ac-&#xD;
companied by this one person, Dr. Wilkins pro-&#xD;
ceeded to the prison of Lady Fredonia, through dark&#xD;
and moldy passages, fit to conduct one to the shades&#xD;
of death. Upon presenting himself so unexpectedly&#xD;
within the gloomy walls of her apartment, a sensa-&#xD;
tion was produced like that of opening a long-closed&#xD;
tower, and startling from their sleep the lazy bats&#xD;
that cling to the dusty ceiling. Only a pint move-&#xD;
ment and flutter of garments betokened life in that&#xD;
dun place. The dead, musty smell of the air turned&#xD;
the doctor sick, and the steward shrank back appalled&#xD;
at the tomb-like aspect of this grave of the living.&#xD;
The old attendant grown silent and moody, like her&#xD;
mistress, hobbled up with a frightened air to meet&#xD;
the intruders; while her ladyship roused herself&#xD;
slowly to recognize her old acquaintance, which she&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
did only by a distant bow. So nearly were life and&#xD;
reason wrecked by her continued sufferings, that she&#xD;
scarcely seemed any longer conscious of the histories&#xD;
or incidents connected with those she had once been&#xD;
well acquainted with. The doctor approached hur&#xD;
couch, and, sitting down beside her, told he her had&#xD;
come to inquire after her health, and hoped to find&#xD;
her well enough to make a visit to the room of the&#xD;
bishop, and afterward to the drawing-room, asking&#xD;
her if she would come.&#xD;
"No, Doctor Wilkins, I have no more desire to&#xD;
leave this place till I am carried out to my grave,"&#xD;
she answered with indifference.&#xD;
"But, we have need of your ladyship. There is&#xD;
important business to be transacted at the castle to-&#xD;
day, and it will be necessary to have your ladyship&#xD;
present," reasoned the doctor.&#xD;
"lily business is all settled, long ago, sir; you will&#xD;
leave me to myself if you please, for I am not able&#xD;
to be disturbed with any new things ;" whispered&#xD;
Lady Fredonia, nervously.&#xD;
"Your ladyship is mistaken about your ability to&#xD;
take part in any affairs of yourself or others. I have&#xD;
news for you. In the first place I have to tell you&#xD;
that I have heard from Marioii lately, and she sends&#xD;
her love to you, if, by any chance I could bring it.&#xD;
You see I have brought it, and I have other news for&#xD;
you. The l~i8hOp i8 dead I"&#xD;
The doctor was not surprised that the intelligence&#xD;
he had to convey should cause her ladyship to faint.&#xD;
If she had not been thus affected in her feeble state&#xD;
of health he would have thought her reason impaired;&#xD;

&#xD;
but this extreme sensibility was an evidence of the&#xD;
ability of her mind to comprehend a fact of interest&#xD;
to herself and to estimate its importance. After&#xD;
waiting for her restoration to consciousness, and fur-&#xD;
ther explaining the late event that so greatly altered&#xD;
her future condition, the doctor had her attendant&#xD;
prepare her for removal. The commissioners, who&#xD;
had been several hours in the house, were to witness&#xD;
her entrance into the apartment where the dead&#xD;
bishop was lying uncared for by his disaffected or&#xD;
superstitious servants. When they beheld her lady-&#xD;
ship approach, leaning on the arm of the doctor, and&#xD;
supported on the other side by the steward, pale and&#xD;
emaciated but calm and dignified, they were struck&#xD;
with pity and a conviction of the injustice under&#xD;
which she had been suffering. Indeed, it was impos-&#xD;
sible not to be affected with so sad and touching a&#xD;
spectacle as this helpless and inj ured lady.&#xD;
The gentlemen who awaited her appearance, accom-&#xD;
panied her with profound respect to the door of her&#xD;
late husband's room, as they had to fulfill their com-&#xD;
mission ~s examiners. Here pausing a moment, all&#xD;
were startled to hear the voice of a woman within,&#xD;
uttering the most fearful imprecations, and upbraid-&#xD;
ing the dead in the most insulting language. The&#xD;
steward threw open the door, and there stood iMille.&#xD;
N.-, in an attitude of despair and frenzy, curs-&#xD;
ing and denouncing her former lover in terms of&#xD;
indescribable passion. As soon as she perceived the&#xD;
intruders, and that Lady Fredonia was among them,&#xD;
she sprang shrieking to where the bishop's pistols&#xD;
were hying, and, snatching one, discharged it at&#xD;
&#xD;
358&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.       3~9&#xD;
her ladyship. It just missed its aim, wounding the&#xD;
steward's right arm.. As the gentlemen sprang for-&#xD;
ward t9 secure her, and thus prevent further mis-&#xD;
chief from her insane despair, she eluded them by&#xD;
thi'owing herself from the chamber window, falling&#xD;
nearly thirty feet to the ground, killing herself almost&#xD;
instantly. Thus ended another life of crime. We&#xD;
may 110W add, to close her history, that it was subse-&#xD;
quently learned she had once been married, and&#xD;
ended a disgraceful and turbulent married life by&#xD;
poisoning her husband and infant child-after wh ~h&#xD;
she escaped to England, and from thence found her&#xD;
way eventually into the bishop's household, as we&#xD;
have seen.&#xD;
The effect of all this excitement upon Lady Fre-&#xD;
donia was to throw her into a serious illness. None&#xD;
doubted her being in the full possession of reason.&#xD;
The condition of affairs in the house rendered it&#xD;
necessary for the chancellor of the Lord Lieutenant to&#xD;
remain and take charge of the bishop's funeral, and&#xD;
whatever other business relating to him might seem&#xD;
necessary. His daughters soon arrived, but were too&#xD;
much overcome with grief and mortification to be&#xD;
able to take any part in the final arrangement of his&#xD;
concerns. He was taken to Dublin to be buried with&#xD;
all the honors of church and state; and the Irish&#xD;
"Ecclesiastical Council," in a fit of benevolence,&#xD;
absolutely appropriated, in his name, quite a large&#xD;
sum of money to be spent in furnishing tobacco and&#xD;
whisky for "wakes" to be held in his honor!&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
LADY FREDONIA's life was for some weeks almost&#xD;
despaired of. Great physical exhaustion and the&#xD;
accumulation of calamities, or rather of horrors, well&#xD;
nigh overcame her little remaining vitality. A&#xD;
stormy life had she led from the hour her father gave&#xD;
her away to an unloved lord; yet, she. desired now&#xD;
to live long enough to prove how much she regretted&#xD;
the serious faults she had committed. Though hum-&#xD;
ble and penitent, she yet knew nothing of the sooth-&#xD;
ing and strengthening influences of Christ's blessed&#xD;
teachings. Ignorance of God's requirements stood&#xD;
in the way of hjer .becoming a consistent Christian.&#xD;
She had always believed there were two churches of&#xD;
true having power-the church of England, first, and&#xD;
tha-t of Rome, next. The original purity of the lat-&#xD;
ter church had always been taught her; she believed&#xD;
its framework right, though filled in with bad mate-&#xD;
rial. At least, that was what she had heard from the&#xD;
clergy ; but it could not be said she fully compre-&#xD;
hended their approval or disapproval of IRomish doc-&#xD;
trines. She desired now to know the truth. But&#xD;
here was an archbishop of her most respected church,&#xD;
whose sins she had good reason to feel sure of, dying&#xD;
under disgraceful circumstances, yet honorably men-&#xD;
tioned and interred with royal magnificence. In&#xD;
America so flagrant an example of corruption would&#xD;
have been held up as a warning to others ; but in&#xD;

England or Ireland the common people were not&#xD;
allowed to speak of such sins in their superiors.&#xD;
What, then, was the worth of such religion, except&#xD;
as a shield to rank and power? Speaking ill of a&#xD;
bi shop was the greatest sin in the catalogue, unless it&#xD;
was to speak ill of the queen. A Methodist clergy-&#xD;
man had called on Lady Fredonia during her illness&#xD;
and conversed with her upon the state 'of her religious&#xD;
impressions; but his teaching of doctrines seemed&#xD;
new, and as it was what is deemed somewhat dis.&#xD;
reputable, in Great Britain, namely di88entinfi, she&#xD;
dared not give it the same attention as if the same&#xD;
doctrine had emanated from the established clerg~r.&#xD;
So, also, priest Smith, a great favorite in the neigh-&#xD;
ix~rhood, who had been in one place thirty years, and&#xD;
had christened a great many Protestant children in&#xD;
spite ot~ his Catholic faith, wished to administer com-&#xD;
fort to the troubled soul; but nothing seemed really&#xD;
to engage her ladyship's belief. The Protestant&#xD;
clergy gave little attention to her condition, and all&#xD;
the old friends of the family who had courted her in&#xD;
her happier or more prosperous days, seemed to&#xD;
have forgotten that she still lived.&#xD;
In this unsettled and comfortless state, Lady Fre-&#xD;
donia lived, day after day, suffering in body and&#xD;
spirit the recompense of a wasted youth. Every&#xD;
word spoken by persons about the halls was sent to&#xD;
her apartment by that nymph, Echo, as also every&#xD;
step upon the marble pavements, and like the witch&#xD;
that she was, she made every sound reverberate like&#xD;
thunder on the delicate ears of the invalid.&#xD;
Lord Elia sometimes came over to see about' her&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN Two wORLDs.       363&#xD;
&#xD;
ladyship's affairs. The rough old lord was as profane&#xD;
as ever when the knowledge of the chancellor's pro-&#xD;
ceedings came to his ears. Though nothing unu-&#xD;
sual happened, and though he was disposed to&#xD;
think everything right that proceeded from such high&#xD;
authority, he could not forbear a sneer at the title of&#xD;
holy man, as applied to his old friend the bishop.&#xD;
"Holyindeed!" ejaculated the profane old man. "A&#xD;
son of perdition he assuredly was, though he did&#xD;
utter a word or two of truth that last time he was at&#xD;
my castle; but, I got angry then and would not&#xD;
listen, and I have no doubt the chancellor would deal&#xD;
severely with me did he hear me say what is in my&#xD;
mind. But, blast me if I will not say it, if I take a&#xD;
notion, to some of the clergy! Of course a bishop&#xD;
is a holy man, and can do no wrong; because the&#xD;
queen is the fountain of office, and pretends to be&#xD;
the fountain of justice; her crown is the reservoir&#xD;
from whence right and equity are conducted by such&#xD;
channels as she shall prescribe. Therefore, whoever&#xD;
speaks slightingly of any of these, speaks disrespect-&#xD;
fully of her, that is of the church's head, and the&#xD;
sovereign of Great Britain, and is subject to such&#xD;
punishment, extending to life or limb, as the council&#xD;
shall see fit to order. I may take the name of God&#xD;
in vain, as I often do, and subject myself only to a&#xD;
small fine': or, I may pay a larger amount and blas-&#xD;
pheine to any extent I like, to indulge my humor.&#xD;
But, I must be careful how I use the queen's name,&#xD;
or speak of any of her officers. A 'God bless me,'&#xD;
will not undo this piece of mischief as it will the&#xD;
other. Ah, well, Fredonia might have done better&#xD;

than to go kill himself. I don't believe it was the&#xD;
devil who called on us, after all: I think we must&#xD;
have all been drinking."&#xD;
But, if Lord Elia had any doubts about the iden-&#xD;
tity of the devil who had appeared to him, the Irish&#xD;
in that neighborhood had not. Old Tim, who, it will&#xD;
be readily guessed, was in the confidence of some&#xD;
mischievous person, himself was not quite sure whe-&#xD;
ther the appearance was real or not; and, of course,&#xD;
the instigator of the plot did not find it necessary to&#xD;
enlighten him. The bishop's death and the other&#xD;
accompanying events gave plausibility to the story,&#xD;
and it spread like wildfire among the credulous&#xD;
IRoman Catholics, who refused to "wake" him, in&#xD;
consequence. All sorts of marvellous and horrible&#xD;
tales were in circulation about the deceased. Some&#xD;
even affirmed they could hear the rushing as he&#xD;
descended, whirling, down the sides of the awful pit!&#xD;
An Irishman, whose pretty daughter had been the&#xD;
object of flattering attentions from the bishop, and&#xD;
who could only bite his lips and mutter while he&#xD;
lived, now that he was dead revenged himself on his&#xD;
memory by telling how the bishop had seemed to&#xD;
him to look like the evil one-how he had smelt the&#xD;
fumes of purgatory upon him long before he died-.&#xD;
that the servants at the castle had almost been&#xD;
strangled by the burning brimstone.&#xD;
Lady Fredonia's case was freely discussed. Some&#xD;
pitied, while others, remembering her old hard-&#xD;
heartedness, rejoiced or pronounced her sufferings&#xD;
just; while Marion began to have many friends and&#xD;
advocates among those who dared to speak out. The&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
365&#xD;
&#xD;
case of John Woods had not quite been forgotten,&#xD;
and the suggestions with regard to his fate were as&#xD;
Wild and fanciful as the rest of their speculations.&#xD;
Thus the bishop became the subject of universal&#xD;
notice in his death, but the honor was of a doubtful&#xD;
nature as far as the testimony of the common people&#xD;
was concerned;, and the sincerity of his peers might&#xD;
reasonably be doubted, also, since to many of them&#xD;
his policy and purposes must have been apparent.&#xD;
Lady Fredonia was destined to learn yet more of&#xD;
the purity of the religion professed by the clergy of&#xD;
the Established Church. Upon becoming partially re-&#xD;
covered from her illness, she desired to partake of the&#xD;
Lord's Supper, and sent for Mr. Hamilton as the&#xD;
person whose duty it was to administer it. Mr.&#xD;
Hamilton, however, made excuses and avoided the&#xD;
castle, whether from a consciousness of having partici-&#xD;
pated in the bishop's sins, or from fear of the in-&#xD;
fluences which were said to beset the ph~ce, is not&#xD;
known. Failing to secure this gentleman's services,&#xD;
Lady Fredonia sent for Mr. Reade, rector of the church&#xD;
in the parish adjoining, who also "wished to be ex-&#xD;
cused." He thought Mr. Hamilton ought to go.&#xD;
This reluctance to administer religious consolation&#xD;
to the sick made considerable talk in the churches.&#xD;
Already a good many in Mr. Hamilton's parish had&#xD;
gone over to the Methodists, since it was perceived&#xD;
by the Protesfants that the Methodist forms were&#xD;
much more in accordance with Irish character and&#xD;
temperament than any other in the Protestant faith:&#xD;
therefore, it was a great oversight in the rector to&#xD;
neglect any duty at a time when the church was&#xD;

losing its influence as it then was. Mr. Hamilton&#xD;
was reproved for his reluctance, and commanded by&#xD;
his superiors to administer the Lord's Supper to Lady&#xD;
Fredonia if she desired it. Thus coerced, the rector&#xD;
proceeded to the castle. Taking the direction of the&#xD;
wind into consideration, that no breath of contagion&#xD;
might reach him from Lady Fredonia, he put the ele-&#xD;
ments on a board and thrust them into a window of her&#xD;
ladyship's room, saying: "Take, eat this bread which&#xD;
is the Lord's body broken for you: this do in remeni-&#xD;
brance of me until I come ;" and afterward the cup&#xD;
in the same manner, repeating the customary prayers&#xD;
on the outside of the window. This cowardly insult&#xD;
affected Lady Fredonia very greatly. However, she&#xD;
took the symbols in meekness, glad to do anything to&#xD;
show her humility and sincerity.&#xD;
Great was the change in this man's manner since,&#xD;
in Lord Cunningham's day, he had thought it an&#xD;
honor to christen his child.&#xD;
Seeing the manner in which her ladyship was&#xD;
deserted by her peers and her servants, Dr. Wilkins&#xD;
had taken the responsibility of procuring such&#xD;
service as she needed; and among others had pre-&#xD;
vailed upon Mrs. Woods, the kind nurse who had&#xD;
saved Marion's life, and whose son she had so injured,&#xD;
to come and attend upon her sick-bed. This act of&#xD;
Christian forgiveness on the part of Mrs. Woods did&#xD;
much to save her ladyship from bitter unbelief. She,&#xD;
together with the old doctor, were in Lady Fredonia's&#xD;
room when the ceremony of administering the Sacra-&#xD;
ment wa~ gone through with in such a shamefully&#xD;
mocking manner. The doctor would have sworn&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.        307&#xD;
&#xD;
after his usual fashion, buyout of respect to the in-&#xD;
sulted lady, refrained, and quoted Scripture for her&#xD;
consolation quite like a minister; while the good&#xD;
Christian woman, whose sincerity had enabled her to&#xD;
forgive her enemies so generously, took every pains&#xD;
to lead her ladyship's muind in the right direction.&#xD;
Nor was all this true piety lost upon her ladyship.&#xD;
Her troubled and weary spirit found that consolation&#xD;
in this gentle and nuostentatious Christianity which&#xD;
she had never hoped to find on earth; and those&#xD;
days of languishing and pain which scoured her&#xD;
feeble body were blessed with health and strength to&#xD;
her soul. The only desire of her heart now was to&#xD;
see her child, whose life had been passed in exile&#xD;
from her-to hear from her lips that all affection for&#xD;
her mother had not been blotted out by this long and&#xD;
bitter estrangement.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
How this wish was likely to be gratified we sha1l&#xD;
discover by watching the course of events in Ame-&#xD;
rica. It will have been surmised, no doubt, that&#xD;
Marion was kept apprised of the condition of affairs&#xD;
in and about Cunningham Castle. Allen's untiring&#xD;
vigilance and ready skill in converting every idle&#xD;
superstition to his purpose, enabled him to make her&#xD;
conversant with passing events, as they occurred, and&#xD;
the death of the bishop and the circumstances attend-&#xD;
ing it soon became known to her. Ever since the&#xD;
imprisonment of Elia she had been entertaining the&#xD;
wildest hopes of soon meeting her*lover, and the news&#xD;
she received from Ireland tended to confirm this idea.&#xD;
The natural effect of this state of expectation and&#xD;
suspense was to keep her in an unhealthy state of&#xD;
nervous excitement. If Mr. Sumner hinted at the&#xD;
thought of a failure in procuring the restoration of&#xD;
Woods, she was immediately plunged into the slough&#xD;
of despond, from which nothing could arouse her but&#xD;
a change in the tone of his expectations, real or af.&#xD;
fected. The only other subject that had the power,&#xD;
to gain her interest was the mention of her mother's&#xD;
condition, and the fact that John's mother was recon-&#xD;
ciled to her ladyship. This suggested to her mind&#xD;
such pleasant intercourse to be enjoyed in future, that&#xD;
it filled her heart with delight. A knowledge of the&#xD;
circumstances, now seemingly so favorable to all her&#xD;
&#xD;
hopes, had given her reason to believe in the happi-&#xD;
ness that was in store for her. To Sheldon Brown,&#xD;
to the Fowlers, and to Mr. Sumner's family had she&#xD;
communicated them, and received from these friends&#xD;
the liveliest sympathy.&#xD;
Once or twice only had anything occurred to give&#xD;
her reason to apprehend any further difficulty with&#xD;
persons in Great Britain. These occasions were when&#xD;
some of the British officials in the United States had&#xD;
called upon her at Mr. Sumner's to question her about&#xD;
the terms upon which Lord Charles Elia might be&#xD;
discharged. From past experience she had learned&#xD;
to decline any conversation with these dignitaries in&#xD;
person, and to refer them to Mr. Sumner, whose clear,&#xD;
cool, determined judgment and manner had the effect&#xD;
to send them about their business without much ado.&#xD;
But, as if the fates had selected her for every&#xD;
species of annoyance, her pleasant anticipations were&#xD;
all at once scattered to the winds by having a writ&#xD;
served on her, commanding her return to the king-&#xD;
dom at once, and under the great seal, making the&#xD;
command peremptory. This was a new cause for ap-&#xD;
prehension, and Marion, impressed with the power of&#xD;
this writ, would have set out immediately to present&#xD;
herself to the queen, but that again her counsel inter-&#xD;
fered to prevent such a compliance with what he con-&#xD;
sidered an unjust demand. Marion knew that for con-&#xD;
tempt of the queen's prerogative her lands could be&#xD;
seized until her return, and that she was liable to fine&#xD;
and imprisonment should she ever present her~clf to&#xD;
claim them. There seemed to her but one alterna-&#xD;
tive, to petition the queen in her court of chancery,&#xD;

granted or not, to allow her to remain in the United&#xD;
States. By such an act she acknowledged herself a&#xD;
subject, which she was reluctant to do. But, Mr.&#xD;
Sumner made known to her majesty, through the&#xD;
proper medium, that it was Miss Cunningham's desire&#xD;
to remain in the United States for the present; also&#xD;
to reside permanently; and hoped it would not be&#xD;
displeasing to her majesty. He believed, also, that&#xD;
a misunderstanding must be the cause of the corn-&#xD;
mand, and earnestly prayed to be permitted to ex-&#xD;
plain away any such misapprehension through the&#xD;
means of mutual agents. It will not be unfair to add&#xD;
that Mr. Sumner took the liberty of giving a little&#xD;
polite advice as to the wa~ ~n which the English gov-&#xD;
ernment demanded the return of English citizens in&#xD;
the United States.&#xD;
In due course of time the reply came. It was in&#xD;
keeping with the first requisition. Miss Cunning-&#xD;
ham was informed that there could be no mistake;&#xD;
and that, aside from the attribute of sovereignty, the&#xD;
law ascribed to the queen in her political capacity&#xD;
absolute perfection. The queen can do no wrong;&#xD;
and is not only incapable of doing, but of thinking&#xD;
wrong; and no folly or weakness can attach to roy-&#xD;
alty. Puffendorf declares that a subject has no way&#xD;
to compel a prince or princess to give him his due&#xD;
when they shall choose to withhold it. This expla-&#xD;
nation being given, the command was repeated for&#xD;
Miss Cunningham's return to the kingdom.&#xD;

Marion was once more in despair, and gave way1to&#xD;
more immoderate grief than was her custom when&#xD;
meeting a new trial. Her counsel was much vexed&#xD;
both by this feeling and the occasion of it; and rather&#xD;
sternly bade her go read the declaration of indepen-&#xD;
dence, then to realize what it had cost to maintain it.&#xD;
"Behold," said he, "your rights, and go and enjoy&#xD;
them." "But I shall lose my inheritance," cried&#xD;
Marion, again in despair at the thought of so much&#xD;
sorrow and so many losses. "Your inheritance !"&#xD;
ejaculated Mr. Sumner. "He~'e is your inheritance&#xD;
-such as every true American has :-~--the right and&#xD;
the liberty to seek his happiness in his own way, and&#xD;
to acquire a conipetency or fortune in any occupation&#xD;
he is fitted for or may choose." But Marion did not&#xD;
feel like earning a fortune before she began to enjoy&#xD;
it, when she ought to have one without delay; and&#xD;
the disappointment caused a passionate fit of crying.&#xD;
"Take her to her room, wife," said he; "I cannot&#xD;
bear women's crying ;" and thither Marion went, ac-&#xD;
compained by her friend. "It is not the fortune, so&#xD;
much," sobbed Marion, "but how can I now go to&#xD;
see my mother, or Mrs."-- and here she broke&#xD;
down again, not being able to speak the name of&#xD;
John's mother, now that she could never hope to see&#xD;
her. Mrs. Sumner let her cry as much as she liked&#xD;
-judging rightly that the best way to brighten the&#xD;
sky was to discharge the rain from the clouds.&#xD;
When Marion became more composed, she wished&#xD;
to see her counsel and talk with him about the laws&#xD;
of allegiance. In answer to her questions, Mr. Sum-&#xD;
ner informed Marion that her birth upon English soil&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7665-00000187"/>&#xD;
372      THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL&#xD;
laid her under perpetual obligatioiis to the crown, if&#xD;
she wished to recognize English laws.&#xD;
"What, not unless I am under it ?" she inquired.&#xD;
"Not any more than you are under United States&#xD;
laws in England ?"&#xD;
"There is a difference," said Mr. Sumner; "an&#xD;
American away from home is bound by no restraint;&#xD;
he is at liberty to adopt any country he may choose&#xD;
No man, except one elected to office, takes an oath to&#xD;
support the Constitution, while every subject of Great&#xD;
Britain is bound to sustain the crown, whether in&#xD;
office or not."&#xD;
"I should think that a residence in another coun-&#xD;
try under another government, and having sworn alle-&#xD;
giance to another sovereign, would release a subject&#xD;
from duty to the queen," said Marion.&#xD;
Mr. Summer brought a volume of Blackstone and&#xD;
read some passages under the head of "Natural&#xD;
Allegiance," which the law declares is due from all&#xD;
men born in the king's dominions, from the moment&#xD;
of their birth. Natural allegiance is there defined as&#xD;
a debt of gratitude which can never be forfeited, can-&#xD;
celled or altered, by any change of time, place, or&#xD;
circumstances; nor by anything but the united con-&#xD;
currence of the legislature. An Englishman who&#xD;
removes to France or China owes the same a~egi-&#xD;
ance there as at home, and twenty years hence as&#xD;
now; for it is a principle of English law that a natu-&#xD;
ral born subject of one prince cannot, by any act of&#xD;
his own, nor even by swearing allegiance to aiiother,&#xD;
put off or discharge his natural allegiance, which is&#xD;
intrinsic and primitive, and antecedent to any other,&#xD;
&#xD;
OR~ LIFE IN Two WORLDS.        373&#xD;
&#xD;
and cannot be divested without the concurrent act&#xD;
of that prince to whom his allegiance is due, as the&#xD;
English crown. It makes no difference who lie&#xD;
sweai4s his allegiance to; that is said to 1)e his own&#xD;
act, and if he chooses to entangle himself by owning&#xD;
service to 'two masters, it is declared unreasonable&#xD;
that by such voluntary act he should be loosed from&#xD;
the bonas by which he is allied to his natural prince.&#xD;
Marion was confounded by the discovery of the&#xD;
bondage into which she had been born, by her&#xD;
nativity on English soil. "1 do not know why," she&#xD;
said, "an Englishman is not as much an object of&#xD;
suspicion to your politicians as an Irish Roman&#xD;
Catholic. I cannot see much difference between&#xD;
church and state government in this; for the pope&#xD;
could not exact more than is expressed in the decla-&#xD;
rations you have just read."&#xD;
Mr. Sumner explained that, although there was&#xD;
little or no difference, the Protestants found less diffi-&#xD;
culty in getting along together, because their faith&#xD;
was the same; and, Englishmen being Protestants,&#xD;
worked themselves more easily into American society,&#xD;
though their hearts might be as full of opposition to&#xD;
its liberal principles as possible.&#xD;
It was no wonder, Marion thought, that some&#xD;
minds were led to speculate on the consequences of&#xD;
permitting such an influx of foreign sentiment. But&#xD;
Sumner laughed at her remark, and said, gaily, "as&#xD;
we managed to subdue the old Lion, w will take&#xD;
care of her whelps without any difficulty. They&#xD;
may growl a little sometimes, and gnash their teeth at&#xD;
us, but we are not afraid of this childish amusement."&#xD;

&#xD;
"I havi often wondered," said Marion, "that,&#xD;
enjoying such privileges as they do, and having such&#xD;
high notions of liberty and rights, the Americaiis are&#xD;
not a more religious people; whereas, there appears&#xD;
to be a great many infidels and deists among them."&#xD;
"They are not without religious sentiments,"&#xD;
replied Sumner; "but they have been disgusted with&#xD;
bigotry and mmnmnery, with pomp and parade, the&#xD;
worth of which js easily seen, and perhaps go to the&#xD;
other extreme to avoid this one. From a careful&#xD;
attention to God's word, and comparing the com-&#xD;
mandments which he has given, regulating the duties&#xD;
of his creatures toward himself as God, and toward&#xD;
one another, it will be found that, for the latter, there&#xD;
is ten to one of the former; thus showing what vital&#xD;
Christianity is-reverence toward God, and a careful&#xD;
observance of our duties toward our fellow-creatures.&#xD;
For these, no parade is necessary. I have no doubt&#xD;
that the Creator had a special design to establish on&#xD;
this continent a better order of things than existed in&#xD;
the old; and that here the problem of human rights&#xD;
and duties is to be worked out."&#xD;
"It is very certain," said Marion, "that the Ameri-&#xD;
can's God is as different from the Englishman's as his&#xD;
government. The first sermon I ever listened to in&#xD;
this country, made a strange impression on me. It&#xD;
was preached by the IRev. C. G. Finney. His text&#xD;
was: 'The Son of man came to seek and save that&#xD;
which was lost.' The speaker was capable of arous-&#xD;
ing great enthusiasm in his audience; and when I&#xD;
went in, he was just in the act of saying, 'Poor&#xD;
sinners! Jesus Christ pitied you, because you had&#xD;
&#xD;
such notions of his Father as would prevent a recon-&#xD;
ciliation and feeling of security in Him. Therefore,&#xD;
he left the plains of celestial glory, to spend a season&#xD;
with you, and teach you the infinite love of the&#xD;
Father. ile showed you what was required, and&#xD;
that you could have comfort for all your earthly sor-&#xD;
rows in Him.' The speaker went on to set forth the&#xD;
character of God, as I never before heard it; and I&#xD;
confess I found it did me good, for it shortened the&#xD;
dreary distance between God and myself~, immea-&#xD;
surably. Americans ought to be a happy people,&#xD;
since they have so near and benevolent a God; and&#xD;
are not compelled to accept the austere doctrines that&#xD;
chill the hearts of loyal Englishmen, according to the&#xD;
inscription upon the tombstone of Henry Adams,&#xD;
where it is 'said he 'took his flight from the dragon of&#xD;
persecution, practiced under the name of religion, and&#xD;
lit at Ylallaston, with his eight sons' Poor fellow!&#xD;
Mount Wallaston seemed to him Mount Zion, no&#xD;
doubt. Perhaps this land is what Paul saw, when he&#xD;
was caught up into the Third Heaven,.and saw such&#xD;
wonders that it was not lawful for him to speak of&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Marion resolved to abide by her counsel's advice&#xD;
in all matters pertaining to her temporal interests, at&#xD;
present, as he seemed to have no doubt of the final&#xD;
issue; and, in anticipation of her coining into posses-&#xD;
/ sion of her rights at an early day, he had excused the&#xD;
services she had been rendering in his family, when&#xD;
her health permitted. It may be doubted, however,&#xD;
whether this latter was as wise a step as most of his&#xD;
actions were, since an occupation is absolutely neces-&#xD;

&#xD;
sary to the peace of an active mind, open to such tern-&#xD;
pests of sorrow as had assailed her from time to time.&#xD;
Like the ocean is the human mind in its ebbs and&#xD;
flows; and when, by an enthusiasm either of grief or&#xD;
pleasure, it has upheaved itself in great waves of feel-&#xD;
ing, it takes much time to subside into perfect peace&#xD;
again; and not before it has lashed itself against the&#xD;
sharp rocks iii~ its fury, does its restlessness abate.&#xD;
Ever it is casting off vapor or foam, never resting,&#xD;
but ever changing. Sometimes, standing on a rocky&#xD;
coast and seeing the tide come in, we are reminded of&#xD;
a strong mind struggling to grasp God's meaning in&#xD;
the universe; or of a truth attempting to pass&#xD;
through society, either abstractedly, or in the form of&#xD;
a good man fearless of censure. How often, in its&#xD;
majestical course, is it dashed against the rocky pre-&#xD;
judices, or scorn, or unbelief of mankind! If it utter&#xD;
not a word, its very countenance brings out the stony&#xD;
opposition of the false, the vain, or the profligate.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
NEARLY a year had passed since Marion entered&#xD;
Mr. Sumner's family, and March, which had "come&#xD;
in like a lamb," was "going out like a lion." The con-&#xD;
dition of her health was still rather precarious; indeed&#xD;
she had not been without medical attendance since&#xD;
her residence in New York, and she numbered among&#xD;
her most disinterested friends the good Dr. Henry,&#xD;
who had attended her through rain and sun, once or&#xD;
twice or thrice a day, during all that time-always&#xD;
cheerfully, and never making regular charges. To&#xD;
his skill and kindness she owed what little strength&#xD;
was left her; and many had been the occasion when&#xD;
the doctor had evinced a feeling of resentment&#xD;
against her oppressors equal to what he would have&#xD;
felt for one of his own family. Like Dr. Wil-&#xD;
kins he was somewhat excitable and given to profan-&#xD;
ity or blustering, but he was a most cordial friend&#xD;
and excellent man, whom Marion loved sincerely.&#xD;
About the last of March, when the rough winds&#xD;
had made Marion unusually sensitive, and obliged&#xD;
her to keep her room almost altogether, 'she began to&#xD;
notice something in the family which annoyed her&#xD;
excessively. Now, of course, she knows the secret,&#xD;
and appreciates the kindness that dictated it; but&#xD;
then it was a terrible trial to her irritable nerves to&#xD;
witness daily what she could not understand, and yet&#xD;
feel that it had relation to herself. In attempting to&#xD;

TIlE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GrRL&#xD;
&#xD;
spare her any excitement, they inadvertently occa-&#xD;
sioned her a great deal of mental pain.&#xD;
That Mr. and Mrs. Sumner had a secret which con-&#xD;
cerned her, she had clearly divined; but the nature&#xD;
of it was beyond her ability to conceive. From the&#xD;
troubled and restless manner of Mr. Sumner she&#xD;
feared it was some new misfortune, which lie was&#xD;
striving to avert without paining her with the know-&#xD;
ledge. So careful had they been to keep it from her,&#xD;
that the children had been charged not to converse&#xD;
with her upon the subject of her affairs. One day.&#xD;
when little Nelly, who was Marion's special pet, came&#xD;
into her room looking very sorrowful, upon Marion&#xD;
asking the cause of her trouble she burst into tears&#xD;
and answered that she "thought Miss Cunningham&#xD;
was going to stay with them always." This answer&#xD;
aroused Marion's curiosity, and she asked Nelly what&#xD;
she meant by that; but the child only sobbed, and&#xD;
said her father and mother would not allow her to&#xD;
tell. Marion longed very much to probe the ulys-&#xD;
tery, but would not take advantage of the child's&#xD;
artlessness to question her, and directly the nurse&#xD;
was sent to bring Nelly away.&#xD;
This silence upon a subject that she knew must&#xD;
concern herself made Marion very nervous, especially&#xD;
as Mrs. Sumner tried to keep the children away from&#xD;
her, lest some word should escape them to betray&#xD;
their secret. Mrs. Sumner still continued as kind as&#xD;
ever, but reserved and thoughtful. The only guess&#xD;
Marion could make was to presume that some other&#xD;
trouble had arisen with the English ministry about&#xD;
the writ. She knew from experience how much&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
their smoothness was to be dreaded, and that no&#xD;
Roman Catholic influence was so dangerous, because&#xD;
so unsuspected. When assailed by these fancies, she&#xD;
tried to soothe herself with such books as would&#xD;
arouse her independence, and inspire her with some-&#xD;
like Yankee sang froid.&#xD;
One day when she was trying Mr. Sumner's recipe&#xD;
for low spirits-the Declaration of Independence-&#xD;
she had her attention drawn to the fact that there&#xD;
was a great deal of earnest whispering in the parlor.&#xD;
It was impossible not to hear some portions of the&#xD;
conversation, which was between Mrs. Sumner and&#xD;
Mrs. Dr. Henry, from which she gathered that some&#xD;
event was to come off soon which caused the doctor&#xD;
a great deal of anxiety. Marion closed doors and&#xD;
windows, the better to keep out the whispering, which&#xD;
made her so nervous it was impossible to endure it.&#xD;
Every fibre of her frame seemed jarring with an&#xD;
indescribable discord, and she wished any catastro-&#xD;
phe might happen which would deprive her of hear-&#xD;
ing and feeling. But recovering herself partially,&#xD;
she began to reflect upon what a different situation&#xD;
would have been hers, had those persons with whom&#xD;
she was so unfortunately connected been possessed of&#xD;
any real candor or Christian feeling. If it was her&#xD;
property they wanted-there was enough for them&#xD;
all to enjoy in comfort, had they been disposed to&#xD;
trust in her friendship. But, with the suspicion which&#xD;
always accompanies conscious unworthiness, they had&#xD;
failed to believe in her generosity, and undertaken&#xD;
to crush her out of existence in order to enjoy what&#xD;
they inigbt~ have had just as well without. What~&#xD;

380      THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL;&#xD;
ever might have been the happiness of her estate,&#xD;
there was no bringing back the bygone opportunities.&#xD;
Those whose love she should have shared, had, by&#xD;
their own acts, given the last stab to agonizing affec-&#xD;
tion, and she was free to cut herself entirely loose&#xD;
from them and their country, which was no longer&#xD;
hers. Again she said she would not be overcome&#xD;
with evil, but strive to overcome evil with good.&#xD;
Marion was lying on her couch, fancying herself&#xD;
tolerably composed, when she began to~ notice a flut-&#xD;
ter of preparation downstairs, as 'if something&#xD;
unusual was about to happen. Listening a moment,&#xD;
she only heard the voice of Mr. Sumner in the hall,&#xD;
saying-" at twenty minutes after three precisely.&#xD;
I will go now and change my clothes." A feverish&#xD;
anxiety to know the event that was expected took&#xD;
possession of her. She had not been able to go to&#xD;
the lunch-table, nor even to eat the nice morsel which&#xD;
Mrs. Sumner had sent up for her, on account of this&#xD;
annoying anxiety; and she began to feel offended,&#xD;
though she scarcely knew that she ought to be so.&#xD;
Nervously she watched the little French clock in her&#xD;
room. Two, half-past two, three! and Mrs. Sumner&#xD;
entered, smiling, and told her she was going to have&#xD;
a little company to dinner, and had invited some of&#xD;
Marion's friends. She hoped she would be able to&#xD;
come down, and offered to assist her in putting on&#xD;
something becoming. But a second look at Marion's&#xD;
glassy eyes and flushed cheeks informed her that she&#xD;
could not go downstairs in that condition.&#xD;
Alarmed, she began immediately to put cold water&#xD;
on her head, and chafe her hands and feet. She&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO wORLDs.       3S1&#xD;
&#xD;
wanted to send for Dr. Henry, but dreaded to do so,&#xD;
for fear his prescriptions would interfere with her&#xD;
plans. While she was laboring to quiet her patient,&#xD;
feeling inwardly conscious that she was to blame for&#xD;
her being in such a state of excitement, the clock&#xD;
struck four. At the same moment there was&#xD;
time noise of carriages arriving, and directly Mr.&#xD;
Sumner'~ step on the stairs.&#xD;
"Let that lady alone until I have seen her," called&#xD;
out Dr. Henry after him, and in a moment more tIme&#xD;
good doctor came bounding up the stairs with the&#xD;
lightness of boyhood. "How is this !" cried he,&#xD;
sternly, when he saw Marion's condition. "A pretty&#xD;
plight to meet your friends in. Why, I shall have to&#xD;
bring Brown up here to see you." Then turning to&#xD;
Mrs. Sumner: "Let us have some water, a glass&#xD;
and spoons as quickly as possible. I shall have to&#xD;
dose this young lady."&#xD;
Mrs. Sumner gave the order immediately, and&#xD;
stood looking on with a half-disposition to cry over&#xD;
the consequences of her mystery. But, when the&#xD;
medicine had been administered, Marion rallied at&#xD;
once. Whether it was the revulsion in her feelings&#xD;
or the medicine she could not tell. Then Mrs. Sum-&#xD;
ner proceeded to brusli Marion's hair and tidy her up&#xD;
a little in appearance. After this was accomplished,&#xD;
another powder was given, by which time her patient&#xD;
was stimulated up to the point of endurance thought&#xD;
necessary; and they descended together to the parlor&#xD;
to meet the company.&#xD;
When they appeared at the door, Dr. Henry&#xD;
stepped forward and taking Marion on his arm, led&#xD;

&#xD;
her to where Sheldon Brown and B. F. Allen stood&#xD;
conversing together. Her joyful surprise at meeting&#xD;
with Alleii can better be imagined than described.&#xD;
But, there was no chance for demonstrations nor for&#xD;
asking questions. She was obliged to greet Brown&#xD;
and her other friends who were there assembled.&#xD;
Before she was hardly conscious of being in the united&#xD;
presence of all her best friends, the doctor led her&#xD;
through a half-opened door into the back parlor.&#xD;
Gracious Heaven! what spectre was that! But&#xD;
there could be no other like this one, and springing&#xD;
forward into Johm lFoods' out-stretched arms, she&#xD;
fainted quite away. Nobody was alarmed, however.&#xD;
It is seldom any one dies of joy. The good doctor&#xD;
assisted the lover to restore her to consciousness,&#xD;
after which he departed, closing the door after him.&#xD;
Had it not been so sorrowful, it would have been a&#xD;
scene to smile at-the greeting of these long-sepa-&#xD;
rated lovers. Both were ill, both pale and emaciated&#xD;
with suffering; but the energy of their gladness was&#xD;
not anything abated by that fact. They would pro-&#xD;
bably have forgotten what was due to the untiring&#xD;
friends by whose exertions they were permitted to&#xD;
enjoy this meeting, but Mr. Sumner caine to an-&#xD;
nounce dinner quite too sooi~i to find their appetites&#xD;
prepared, and they were compelled to join the coin-&#xD;
pany.&#xD;
~Marion was too happy, even to try to seem grate-&#xD;
ful. She said nothing to Allen or the others about&#xD;
what she owed to them, and only sat silent~ looking&#xD;
from one to another in supreme contentment; while&#xD;
John Woods, in a half-unconscious manner, imi-&#xD;
&#xD;
tated her example. The company finding that they&#xD;
had two silent members, were all the more talkative&#xD;
and mirthful; and the wine which Mr. Sumner&#xD;
had furnished for the occasion, was drank with many&#xD;
a tender or patriotic sentiment.&#xD;
After dinner was over, Marion learned all about&#xD;
this late appearance of mystery. Of course it took&#xD;
some time and thought to prepare all those pretty&#xD;
and appropriate bridal gifts, to have them in readi-&#xD;
ness for the occasion, every one accompanied by an&#xD;
appropriate motto. Mr. Sumner presented her a&#xD;
beautiful silver urn on which was engraved an eagle&#xD;
soaring ever St. Helena, bearing in his talons a&#xD;
shield, anchor and trumpet, and in his beak a ribbon&#xD;
with the motto, "Free Trade, and a right to love&#xD;
and marry whom you please."&#xD;
Mrs. Sumner, a handsome statuette, representing&#xD;
the Genius of America trampling under her feet a lion,&#xD;
and around the pedestal the motto: "I subdue you."&#xD;
Nelly Summer presented a picture of a "sweet&#xD;
little cherub thatsits up aloft "-holding a ribbon on&#xD;
which was inscribed: "John Woods is saved for his&#xD;
Marion."&#xD;
Mrs. Dr. Henry, an elegantly bound copy of Watts'&#xD;
Hymns, and o~n a fly leaf this beautiful address:&#xD;
"Children of sorrow awak~i from your sadness,&#xD;
Awake, for the night of your sorrows is o'er;&#xD;
Bright o'er the hills dawns the day-star of gladness-&#xD;
Arise, for your fear can oppress you no more.&#xD;
"And if with the hope our country to plunder.&#xD;
The tyrant to invade her should ever pretend;&#xD;
His legions shall shrink when our armed freemen thunder-&#xD;
Thcy fight for their true-loves, wives, children and f~ends."&#xD;

&#xD;
'1'he doctor slily presented an elegant silver port-&#xD;
monnaie, on which was already graven her future&#xD;
name, Marion1 C~nninqkctm~ Wood8; and Sheldon&#xD;
Brown added a beautiful card-case similarly en-&#xD;
graven. Thomas ~Mic Lain's gift was a silver tea-set,&#xD;
with the same initials upon each piece.&#xD;
When Marion looked upon all these testimonials&#xD;
of kindness, her heart overran with gratitude, and&#xD;
she acknowledged that she had done nothing and&#xD;
been nothing to deserve it; though she resolved sLe&#xD;
would in future merit it all.&#xD;
The congratulations were hardly over in the house&#xD;
before the door was besieged by a party of, Irish and&#xD;
Scotch who had got an inkling of the affair, and were&#xD;
determined not to be behind in expressing their&#xD;
appreciation of the generosity of the American&#xD;
gentlemen as exhibited in behalf of Marion and her&#xD;
lover, in contending for their rights and personal&#xD;
safety. Mr. Sumner brought out the wine, and,&#xD;
after drinking" extinction of oppression wherever&#xD;
practiced by principal or agent ;" and&#xD;
"ratient in toil, serene amidst alarms,&#xD;
Inflexible in faith, invincible in arms,"&#xD;
they shook hands with the American gentlemen and&#xD;
departed. Further demonstrations would have been&#xD;
made; and the English Consul burned in effigy, for&#xD;
serving the writ upon Miss Cunningham; but Sumner&#xD;
objected strongly to any such public manifestation of&#xD;
feeling as being inappropriate to the occasion; and&#xD;
the national sentiment was appeased. Much interest&#xD;
was manifested, and much curiosity felt to know the&#xD;
&#xD;
particulars of John Woods' history since his incarce-&#xD;
ration in a Dublin prison; but, the subject was so&#xD;
painful to all those most concerned, that it was voted&#xD;
down, and all that was known about it was that,&#xD;
after being several times removed from place to&#xD;
place in Ireland, and suffering all the horrors of con-&#xD;
finement in dark and loathsome dens, he was finally&#xD;
removed, about one year previous, to St. ilelena,&#xD;
where, without enjoying his liberty, he was more&#xD;
humanely treated, and allowed partially to recover&#xD;
his health which had been almost ruined by his long&#xD;
imprisonment.&#xD;
Allen and Marion talked over affairs in Ireland,&#xD;
and to her lie made known all those plans and little&#xD;
intrigues by which he had succeeded in checking the&#xD;
intrigues of others. Whatever they were, sin~e the&#xD;
purpose of them is accomplished, it would be tedious&#xD;
to relate them.&#xD;
Marion was much affected by the report of her&#xD;
mother's situation and feelings, and resolved that not&#xD;
many months should pass over her head without&#xD;
bringing her to see that lonely and sad parent, who,&#xD;
whatever her errors might have been, was not with-&#xD;
out a strong claim on her sympathy and attention.&#xD;
John Woods made many friends in New York, and&#xD;
Marion had no reason to blush for her choice; or&#xD;
that she had undergone so much for his sake. It is&#xD;
needless to say that she was no longer the despond-&#xD;
ing invalid of the year before; and her friends often&#xD;
had occasion to rally both the lovers on their&#xD;
improved appearance.&#xD;
It was rather a disappointment to outsiders not to&#xD;

hear that a wedding was to come off immediately.&#xD;
It was reasonable to conclude that those who had&#xD;
suffered so much for each other, and been separated&#xD;
by so many dangers, would guard against future&#xD;
separations by uniting at once in indissoluble bonds,&#xD;
and so, oftentimes, their hearts prompted them.&#xD;
But wise heads and kind hearts had counselled other-&#xD;
wise, and that final union was postponed to another&#xD;
occasion, a little in the future.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
AFrER lingering a few days in New York, Allen&#xD;
took his leave of those persons who owed him an&#xD;
everlasting debt of gratitude, and hastened to see his&#xD;
mother and Annie Stewart. As the ingenious Yan-&#xD;
kee has all along played so importhut a part in the&#xD;
history of Marion Cunningham, it is only just to the&#xD;
interest of the reader to relate what re&amp;amp;rs to the&#xD;
romance in which his Irish adventures had entangled&#xD;
him. It has been hinted, elsewhere, that Allen's&#xD;
devotion to Annie Stewart was something more than&#xD;
the tender sympathy' of the strong and brave for the&#xD;
weak and tender; and as a natural consequence of&#xD;
this deeper feeling, his meeting with Annie was&#xD;
looked forward to with agitating doubts and delicious&#xD;
hopes, alternately. But the agitation of his mind&#xD;
was calmed on reaching home and finding only his&#xD;
mother there, with whom he had a long confidential&#xD;
talk, before his ward returned from some pleasure&#xD;
excursion in which she had taken a part. A little&#xD;
feeling of jealousy disturbed Allen's mind when he&#xD;
first fancied her enjoying herself in the society of&#xD;
another; but he banished it iimnediately as unjust to&#xD;
her youth and temperament. Why should she not&#xD;
see something of the' world before he asked her for&#xD;
an answer to the most important question she ever&#xD;
could be called upon to decide?&#xD;
While these thoughts were running through his&#xD;

&#xD;
mind, his mother was telling him, though lie scarcely&#xD;
listened, that this party of pleasure was the only one&#xD;
Annie had attended sinec her arrival-that for a long&#xD;
time she had been afraid to trust her away from home&#xD;
on account of the Catholic excitement, and, more&#xD;
recently, Annie had not desired to go out, but had&#xD;
applied herself closely to her hooks and her home&#xD;
duties. The attachment between the old lady and her&#xD;
young adopted daughter was very cordial-indeed, as&#xD;
much so as Allen could possibly have desired; and&#xD;
it delighted him to hear all the praises she had to&#xD;
bestow upon her.&#xD;
In the midst of their happy talk, Annie made her&#xD;
appearance, attended by a young Englishman-a&#xD;
neighbor of his mother, whose family claimed to be*&#xD;
connected with people of high blood. Allen, wisW&#xD;
ing, with his native disposition for knowing secrets,&#xD;
to learn something of Annie's feelings from watch.&#xD;
ing her awhile unseen, slipped out of the room&#xD;
as she entered it with George Brondey, and&#xD;
concealed himself where he could observe her&#xD;
movements. She was lovely indeed, with her&#xD;
girlish form in a spotless robe of white; her long&#xD;
brown curls fallingaround a face of sweetest expres-&#xD;
sion and contrasting with the fairness of her regal&#xD;
neck and shoulders! He almost began to be jealous&#xD;
again as the young fop at her side betrayed his admi-&#xD;
ration in every glance. But the smiling unconscious-&#xD;
ness of Annie enabled him to retain his compos-&#xD;
ure. Tie heard her assure his mother that she had&#xD;
spent the day very pleasantly, but was glad to get&#xD;
home to her again; there was no place plea-&#xD;
&#xD;
banter than her own home. George Brondey's face&#xD;
grew a little clouded at this expression of preference,&#xD;
while Allen's heart bounded with gladness.&#xD;
Annie, with instinctive delicacy, perceived that her&#xD;
escort was disappointed by her remarks, and has-&#xD;
tened to smooth over the wound with a merry account&#xD;
of her numerous pleasant adventures that day. It&#xD;
seemed two hours to Allen in his retreat, though it&#xD;
was not thirty minutes that the young man lingered&#xD;
before taking his leave, and then he saw Annie turn&#xD;
to his mother and exclaim, as she put her hand on&#xD;
either side the old lady's face and kissed her withered&#xD;
mouth affectionately:&#xD;
"Why, mother, I never saw you looking so&#xD;
young and happy; what has occurred in my ab-&#xD;
sence&#xD;
"Oh, nothing so unexpected; good news from&#xD;
England-that is all," answered the old lady, with a&#xD;
touch of her son's mysteriousness.&#xD;
"Was there no letter for me ?" she inquired,&#xD;
hastily.&#xD;
"No, my dear, there was none for you."&#xD;
A shadow fell over Annie's bright face, and, walk-&#xD;
big away from the light, she stood silently looking&#xD;
out of the window. Mrs. Allen smiled, and gazed at&#xD;
the coals in the grate, for it was a cool evening in&#xD;
April.&#xD;
Presently, Annie turned her head in the direction&#xD;
of her adopted mother, and ho, there stood a never-&#xD;
to-be-forgotten form, which a moment before she had&#xD;
thought of as being on the other side of the Atlantic.&#xD;
The delicate color forsook her check, and, when&#xD;

&#xD;
Allen reached her side, he received her fainting form&#xD;
in his arms.&#xD;
" Who would have thought the child was so sensi-&#xD;
tive," cried the mother, as she hastened to assist in&#xD;
restoring consciousness.&#xD;
Allen made no reply. Quietly, without summon-&#xD;
ing a servant, or making any other unpleasant&#xD;
exposure of her feelings, Mrs. Allen attended to her&#xD;
health, and when she was sufficiently recovered,&#xD;
accompanied her to her room, remarking that she had&#xD;
been too much fatigued by her day of pleasure. So&#xD;
the timid girl had the benefit of believing that her&#xD;
mother and guardian attributed her sudden illness to&#xD;
fatigue.&#xD;
It would be difficult to analyze the emotions which&#xD;
filled the young mind of Annie Stewart, even did we&#xD;
care for the analysis. Most of the world understands&#xD;
these things without explanation. Heart interprets&#xD;
heart with very few blunders, where only the natural&#xD;
sentiments are concerned.&#xD;
When the lovers--for though unacknowledged ,th ey&#xD;
still were lovcrs-met at the breakfast-table, it would&#xD;
be difficult to tell which one suffered most from&#xD;
embarrassment. There are occasional times in the&#xD;
life of the bravest man, when he is as weak and ner-&#xD;
vous as a woman ; and it is generally the example of&#xD;
some woman that makes him so. If Allen did not do&#xD;
justice to the excellent breakfast-cakes, or if Annie's&#xD;
coffee cup trembled in her hand, nobody was the&#xD;
wiser, except the mother, and she very discreetly&#xD;
talked of matters the most foreign to their feelings,&#xD;
until something like composure was restored.&#xD;
&#xD;
390&#xD;
&#xD;
Annie had many questions to ask about Marion,&#xD;
and all the circumstances of his travels, as soon as&#xD;
her usual self-possession came back to her, which it&#xD;
took the forenoon to answer.&#xD;
In the afternoon, Mrs. Allen was favored with a&#xD;
call from the mother of George Brondey, the purpose&#xD;
of which visit surprised her not a. little. This lady&#xD;
was the wife of an Englishman of a comfortable for-&#xD;
ture, who had lived in the Aeighborhood of' the&#xD;
Allens for several years, without an acquaintance&#xD;
ever having ripened between them. Indeed, Mrs.&#xD;
Allen had never suspected before that they prided&#xD;
themselves on being English, and that they looked&#xD;
condescending'ly upon their American neighbors.&#xD;
Such, however, was the fact, as transpired in the&#xD;
course of that day's conversation. Mrs. Brondey&#xD;
had known for some time that a young English girl&#xD;
of good family had been staying with Mrs, Allen-so&#xD;
she said-and, under rather peculiar circumstances ;&#xD;
but, until lately, she had not taken much notice&#xD;
of the rumors concerning her. Of late, however, her&#xD;
son, George, had conceived a great partiality for the&#xD;
young lady, and, knowing she was of good blood&#xD;
and birth, they desired to adopt her into their family.&#xD;
Mrs. Brondey did not conceal the fact that they&#xD;
had hopes of being able to secure her fortune to her,&#xD;
and that a marriage was contemplated between her&#xD;
son and the young heiress. She had no doubt Mrs.&#xD;
Allen was very much attached to the child by this&#xD;
time, as it was said she was amiable and pretty ; but,&#xD;
she thought, considering the child's birth and English&#xD;
blood, it would be more proper to have her brought&#xD;

up under English customs. She might some day&#xD;
desire to return to her relatives, for the enjoyment of&#xD;
the privileges of rank; and, as her-Mrs. Brondey's-.&#xD;
family was a very good one, she felt that she would&#xD;
be a very suitable person to take charge of her.&#xD;
When this very modest proposition was concluded,&#xD;
Mrs. Allen, who had been gazing at her visitor in&#xD;
blank astonishment, arose and called her son, who,&#xD;
with Annie, sat in an inner room.&#xD;
"Ah, I was not aware Mr. Allen bad returned,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Brondey rather stiffly, as he made his ap-&#xD;
peara~ice.&#xD;
Without attending to her remark, Mrs. Allen pro-&#xD;
ceeded to repeat what her visitor had said. During&#xD;
the rehearsal Allen's countenance grew ashen pale.&#xD;
At its conclusion, lie arose, and, opening the door,&#xD;
repeated very distinctly a familiar English phrase-&#xD;
"Mrs. Brondey's carriage 'stops the way."' For. a&#xD;
moment the discomfited lady was motionless with&#xD;
surprise, but there was no mistaking the determined&#xD;
air with which he held the door in waiting, and bit-&#xD;
ing her lips with anger, she sailed majestically out&#xD;
with Allen at her side to escort her to her carriage.&#xD;
She could not refrain from returning the bow of frigid&#xD;
politene~ with which he bade her good day, though&#xD;
it must always be doubted whether she was not in a&#xD;
rage with herself about it afterwards.&#xD;
"Why, Ben, how could you be so rude ?" exclaimed&#xD;
Mrs. Allen, as he re~intered the parlor.&#xD;
"I was not rude, mother; that is, it was no rude-&#xD;
ness to her, after such an insult as she gave you.&#xD;
Jupiter! what intolerable airs these Johnny Bulls&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN Two woRLDs.      393&#xD;
and Bullesses take on! Much interest, indeed, they&#xD;
would take in Annie if there was no fortune in the&#xD;
case! There is great need to learn her English man-&#xD;
ners to fit her to meet her relatives at some future&#xD;
day. Great will be her joy at the meeting, no doubt.&#xD;
But we will hear what she has, to say about it ;" and,&#xD;
stepping to a door, he summoned Annie into his&#xD;
mother's presence. "Tell her about it, mother," said&#xD;
he with a strangely bitter smile.&#xD;
"Nonsense, Ben! Annie will not wish to hear it."&#xD;
"Oh, yes she will. There is no telling how the&#xD;
English blood will come out in her yet. She may&#xD;
think it a very fine thing to marry this George Bron-&#xD;
dey, and go back to England to claim her rights&#xD;
there." Annie sat pale and wondering; for she had&#xD;
never seen her guardian in such a bitter mood before:&#xD;
while talking of marrying George Brondey and going&#xD;
back to England gave her a terrible palpitation of the&#xD;
heart. Mrs. Allen refused to say anything about it,&#xD;
so Allen continued, striding up and down the apart-&#xD;
ment: "We have received a proposition for you to-&#xD;
day, Annie, which is of vei'y serious interest to you.&#xD;
Mrs. Brondey thinks it due to your blood, birth and&#xD;
prospects, that you should receive English training,&#xD;
therefore she proposes to adqpt you in order that you&#xD;
may get it. She further proposes to marry you to&#xD;
her son George, and undertakes the recovery of your&#xD;
property. Now it remains for you to say whether&#xD;
you would be pleased with this arrangement. Recol-&#xD;
lect, if you marry George Brondcy you may yet be a&#xD;
lady, and drive your carriage in the park."&#xD;
Poor Annie! Taken so by surprise that she knew&#xD;

&#xD;
not what to say, and bewildered by her guardian's&#xD;
manner into a doubt of whether she was any longer&#xD;
welcome, she made no answer whatever, but stared&#xD;
blankly at the wall.&#xD;
"You are cruel, Ben," said Mrs. Allen, reproach-&#xD;
fully. "Of course Annie does tiot wish to return to&#xD;
England, and you frighten the child by your harsh-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
"Mother, how do you know Annie does not wish&#xD;
to return, if she can have her proper place in society&#xD;
there? I tell you the English blood will show itself;&#xD;
and I will trust no answer but her own, and that a&#xD;
very deliberate one. Annie, I will' take your answer&#xD;
to-morrow morning~" Abruptly quitting the apart-&#xD;
ment, the faiaily saw him no more that day.&#xD;
Annie went to her room in silence, while Mrs.&#xD;
Allen, failing to find relief for her agitation in snuff-&#xD;
ing, which she was old-fashioned enough to do, took&#xD;
to brushing her carpet violently to work off her un-&#xD;
usual dissatisfaction. She longed to follow Annie&#xD;
and administer consolation for her son's extraordinary&#xD;
impatience; but she was restrained by the reflection&#xD;
that, after all, it might be true that Annie would&#xD;
prefer to enjoy the privileges of foreign rank if she&#xD;
found she could do so, and that it was best not to in-&#xD;
terfere with her decision. Yet, when Annie came&#xD;
down to tea with~ swollen eyes and tear-stained&#xD;
cheeks, and took her single cup in silence, as was&#xD;
~ever her custom, the kind heart of the old lady&#xD;
reproached her.&#xD;
"Ben did not mean to grieve you, my dear," said&#xD;
she tenderly, seeing the child refuse to eat. "He&#xD;

was very much annoyed at Mrs. Brondey's coming&#xD;
here on such an errand as she did: and he thought&#xD;
too, perhaps, that it might be your wish to be restored&#xD;
to your proper rank at home if that could be with&#xD;
safety."&#xD;
"Then he is not tired of me, and does not wish me&#xD;
to marry George Brondey ?" asked Annie, brighten-&#xD;
ing up a little.&#xD;
"Tired of you, child! why, I suspect it would be a&#xD;
hard blow to him to lose you; and it was thinking&#xD;
of what might happen in that way that put him so&#xD;
out of humor. Of course 'he would be de1ighte~ to&#xD;
have you say you preferred to remain here."&#xD;
Annie made no reply. She only kissed her mother's&#xD;
cheeks, and went up to her room again. The second&#xD;
breakfast was a repetition of the first for awkward-&#xD;
ness. After it was over, Allen took his ward by the&#xD;
arm and led her into the back parlor.&#xD;
"Have you decided to go to Mrs. Brondey's ?" he&#xD;
asked, seating her beside him on a sofa.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, if you wish it," she replied, with com-&#xD;
posure.&#xD;
Allen started up as if stung, and commenced&#xD;
pacing the floor. "Why do you say 'yes sir, if you&#xD;
wish it?'"&#xD;
"Because I am bound to do whatever you wish,"&#xD;
answered Annie steadily.&#xD;
"No, Annie, you are not bound to do whatever I&#xD;
wish, by any means. It is more proper that I should&#xD;
do whatever you wish, since you are a lady in your&#xD;
own right; and Allen seated himself on the idle&#xD;
ottoman at her feet.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Are ladies privileged to be ungrateful ?" asked&#xD;
Annie.&#xD;
"I know nothing about gratitude, Annie; and&#xD;
you shall know nothing about it to-day, or ever, with&#xD;
me. I utterly ignore any such feeling. Agaill I ask&#xD;
will you go to Mrs. Brondey's ?"&#xD;
"And again I answer, yes, sir, if you ,wish it ;"&#xD;
repeated Annie in a low, decided tone. Ah, Annie&#xD;
Stewart! was there not a spice of womanly coquetry&#xD;
and malice in that answer? were you not bent on&#xD;
making him say how little he wished it, and how&#xD;
much he wished you to stay? Yes, truly, for co-&#xD;
quetry is woman's only defence, if she be not rich and&#xD;
independent.&#xD;
Allen was vexed. He wanted her to tell him she&#xD;
would not go for worlds-that she would not live out&#xD;
of his presence, and all that; but, when he glanced&#xD;
at her calm face, grown so wonderfully womanly in&#xD;
the last two days, he felt that it was useless to expect&#xD;
it.&#xD;
"Answer me then, once for all, do you desire to&#xD;
go ?" he asked watching her face intently.&#xD;
"No, sir," answered she, without looking up.&#xD;
"Annie I" lie was holding her hand and watching&#xD;
for the expression of her eyes. She did not look at&#xD;
him, but a beautiful color spread rapidly over her&#xD;
face. "I am glad to hear you say that: I was afraid&#xD;
I should lose you after all, when I had once thought,&#xD;
however foolishly, that you would never leave me,&#xD;
that you would be mine forever. Do you understand&#xD;
what my wish is, Annie ?"&#xD;
She trusted one glance from her moist blue eyes,&#xD;
&#xD;
and only one. Tier slight frame trembled violently.&#xD;
Allen had no doubt she understood him, and pitying&#xD;
her timidity, he said gaily: "Well, now Annie, my&#xD;
own Annie in future, if ever you get to be a great&#xD;
lady, don't forget this brief episode in Yankee life!&#xD;
And now, let us go and see our mother, for I have&#xD;
business of importance to arrange with both of&#xD;
you.~~&#xD;
They found Mrs. Allen giving orders about the&#xD;
garden. "I am sorry mother," said Allen, "that I&#xD;
cannot .be at home to take this care off your mind;&#xD;
but, the truth is, I have promised those people in&#xD;
New York to be back there in two weeks to go with&#xD;
them to London, and see the end of their romance;&#xD;
and I want to take Annie along. I have talked&#xD;
with her about Mrs. Brondey, and she don't want to&#xD;
go there: and as we are to have quite a gay party on&#xD;
John Woods' wedding excursion, I have made up my&#xD;
mind to take my wife along."&#xD;
"Oh, Ben !" cried his mother in amazement, while&#xD;
Annie, blushing and half crying, dared not remon-&#xD;
strate; "how precipitate you are. The child is not&#xD;
ready to be married; and I do not see, besides, how&#xD;
you can wish to go again to England immediately.&#xD;
But come in the house," you have quite taken all my&#xD;
strength away by your hasty announcement."&#xD;
So to the house they went, and the result of their&#xD;
consultation was an arrangement for a wedding to&#xD;
come off at the end of a week. "It is only for a&#xD;
month, or at longest six weeks," he argued; an dthen&#xD;
you will have us settled down here for good and all.&#xD;
you threaten to deed the farm to Annie. Very well,&#xD;

do so; when Annie's fortune comes, she will give&#xD;
that to me, and that will make us even again I"&#xD;
"But, I thought i5liss Cunningham did not dare&#xD;
venture into Great Britian," remarked Annie.&#xD;
"She does not intend to land," answered Allen.&#xD;
"Her counsel have been fixing up matters in some&#xD;
way, so that she can meet her mother and other&#xD;
friends, and secure her property besides. Her coun-&#xD;
sel go along and will remain to attend to the busi-&#xD;
ness. Most of the property being hers by will, they&#xD;
are going to get it given to Woods in some way, I&#xD;
hardly understand how. If her grandfather is living,&#xD;
I suppose he can arrange it with her attorney."&#xD;
"And she is going to be married to Woods right&#xD;
under the queen's eyes ?" said his mother. " I think&#xD;
it is hardly right to taunt the government in that&#xD;
way.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, it is just right, exactly. It may serve as&#xD;
a little single lesson to an insolent power, which&#xD;
mercilessly pursues its own aggrandizement at no&#xD;
matter what sacrifice to individuals."&#xD;
"But I am afraid something will happen to Annie,"&#xD;
pursued Mrs. Allen, who did not like the project at all.&#xD;
Allen bade her have no fears on her account: that&#xD;
no power on earth could get her away from him&#xD;
when once she belonged to him. The preparations for&#xD;
the voyage were made as hastily as possible, and, at&#xD;
the end of a week the marriage took place. It was a&#xD;
very light breakfast they took on the morning of the&#xD;
wedding, so natural is it to regard this important&#xD;
event with emotion. Too much importance cannot&#xD;
attach to it, in truth, though, alas! it is too often&#xD;
&#xD;
lightly regarded. It was not strange that the eyes&#xD;
of the young bride lingered on the form of her&#xD;
mother as long as the house could be seen from the&#xD;
carriage. She knew that her eyes once turned to&#xD;
her husband she was~ her own no more forever!&#xD;
That was a pleasant journey however; and when&#xD;
Allen arrived in New York with his bride, he was&#xD;
received with great attention. Old Lord Fowler&#xD;
gave a splendid entertainment, which was followed&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
AT the end of a week, the party took a steamer&#xD;
for London. It consisted of the Sumners, Dr. Henry&#xD;
and lady, Thomas McLain and lady, the other counsel&#xD;
emplQyed in Marion's suit, several friends of her&#xD;
friends, Allen and his bride, and the chief couple in&#xD;
whose 'honor and by whose will and means the ex-&#xD;
cursion was to be made. It was a merry and happy&#xD;
occasion for all who could be merry. It is not al-&#xD;
ways the merriest who are happiest, however. Four-&#xD;
teen days of pleasant sailing weather brought them&#xD;
to anchor in the Thames.&#xD;
It was an amusement to Marion to listen to the&#xD;
comments of her American friends as they passed&#xD;
amongst the shipping. Nearly all the British vessels&#xD;
were named after serpents or monsters of some sort,&#xD;
and Marion pronounced it appropriate that they&#xD;
should be so named. Other peculiarities attracted&#xD;
their attention. The sailors and men on the wharves&#xD;
were not such cheerful, well-conditioned men as they&#xD;
saw in the same occupations at home. The band&#xD;
played "Yankee Doodle," while, at that same mo-&#xD;
ment, a sailor was seen swimming off from a British&#xD;
man of war lying near. He was shot at by an officer&#xD;
and brought back, for the usual punishment, of&#xD;
being "whipped around the fleet" for desertion.&#xD;
But, all that interested Marion and her lover was the&#xD;
appointed meeting. They had not been long in port,&#xD;
&#xD;
when a messenger came on board saying that Lady&#xD;
Fredonia would soon be with them, together with&#xD;
Mrs. Woods, Dr. Wilkins and other invited guests.&#xD;
As the steamer was chartered for the purpose~ the&#xD;
company made themselves entirely at home, and&#xD;
grand preparations were made for the coming occa-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
By and by, from his lookout, Thomas McLairi&#xD;
espied the carriage which he doubted not conveyed&#xD;
the visitors to the steamer, and, descending, he in-&#xD;
formed. Marion of her mother's arrival. The gentle-&#xD;
men went to assist her ladyship and Mrs. Woods on&#xD;
board, while Marion tried to compose herself for the&#xD;
meeting; but, the more she tried, the more nervous&#xD;
she grew, and when, at last, Lady Fredonia was con-&#xD;
ducted into the cabin and seated in an easy-chair,&#xD;
she was without the courage to look upon her own&#xD;
mother. Dr. Henry led her beside her mother's&#xD;
chair, and she there sank down on her knees, and&#xD;
buried her face in the folds of Lady Fredonia's&#xD;
dress. The pale, sad-looking mother bent her head&#xD;
over her, and both wept tears that washed away the&#xD;
sorrows of years.&#xD;
The meeting between John Woods and his mother&#xD;
was equally affecting, though between them there&#xD;
had never been any reproaches. Theirs was a joy&#xD;
unmingled with regret, except for their long and&#xD;
painful separation.&#xD;
Just as the re-united parents and children began to&#xD;
be a little more composed, a new character appeared&#xD;
on the stage, in the person of a servant beam-ing a&#xD;
bird-cage, in which was a green parrot. He set the&#xD;

cage down before Marion and left the bird to make&#xD;
her acquaintance. After turning its head rapidly a&#xD;
number of times, and looking first with one eye then&#xD;
the other, at Marion, it began to flutter about in great&#xD;
excitement, saying " Marion, where have you been&#xD;
where have you been ?" and ending with a laugh loud&#xD;
and long. This little scene, so ludicrous atnd yet&#xD;
affecting, served to divert attenitioni from the principal&#xD;
actors, and. something like calmness succeeded to the&#xD;
storm of emotions. It was difficult, however, to re-&#xD;
cover all at once; and, in order to put unpleasant&#xD;
thoughts out of mind, as soon as the mutual intro-&#xD;
ductions were over, wine was brought out, and con-&#xD;
gratulations drank. A sumptuous dinner soon fol-&#xD;
lowed, at which there were drinking and toasting and&#xD;
song-singing in real merry-making style. No chance&#xD;
was given any one to grow thoughtful or weary.&#xD;
Marion's old friends, Lord Potter and Gen. Arsdell,&#xD;
were present, as well as the Scotch captain who had&#xD;
been so hospitable to her in Glasgow. Between the&#xD;
dinner and the dessert the marriage ceremony was.&#xD;
performed, and Marion Wallace Cunningham became&#xD;
Mrs. John Woods. A salute was then fired, and&#xD;
the American tars sang the following song to the&#xD;
tune of Yankee Doodle:&#xD;
Ye gallant sons of liberty,&#xD;
Who bravely have defended&#xD;
Your country's flag by land and sea, -&#xD;
And to her cause attended,&#xD;
Sing Yankee doodle, doodle-doo,&#xD;
Yankee doodle dandy ;&#xD;
Our tars will show the haughty foe&#xD;
Columbia's sons are handy.&#xD;
&#xD;
403&#xD;
&#xD;
Upon the ocean's wide domain&#xD;
Our tars are firm and true, sirs;-&#xD;
And Fredom's cause they will maintain,&#xD;
With Yankee doodle-doo, sirs:&#xD;
With Yankee doodle, doodle-doo, etc.&#xD;
The fourth day of July, tis said-&#xD;
A day that Britons rue, sirs-&#xD;
An independent tune we played&#xD;
Called Yankee-doodle-doo, sirs.&#xD;
Yankee doodle, doodle-doo, etc.&#xD;
Columbia's sons did then declare&#xD;
-They would be independent';        .&#xD;
And for King George they wouldn't care--&#xD;
Nor yet for his descendants.&#xD;
Yankee doodle, doodle-doo, etc.&#xD;
The bold Prince Regent thought he'd sent&#xD;
A fleet to take our few, sirs;&#xD;
But soon to sea our sailors went&#xD;
With Yankee doodie-doo, sirs:&#xD;
Sing aYankee doodle, doodle-doo,&#xD;
Our tars did show the haughty foe&#xD;
Columbia's sons were handy,&#xD;
The sailors gave nine cheers at the close of this&#xD;
song. Dessert was brought when Dr'. Wilkins sung,&#xD;
in honor of the Americans:&#xD;
0, freemen raise a joyous strain l&#xD;
Aloft your eagle soars:&#xD;
You've met the enemy again-&#xD;
Again have made him yours.&#xD;
Your striped flag upon the wave&#xD;
Triumphantly appears:&#xD;
And to invested landsmen brave&#xD;
The star of promise bears.&#xD;

&#xD;
Britannia, round your haggard brows,&#xD;
Bind bitter wormwood still!&#xD;
For low again your standard bows&#xD;
To valiant Yankee skill.&#xD;
What chaplet proud enough is found&#xD;
Your Yankee brows to grace?&#xD;
'Tis done! the glorious wreath is bound&#xD;
~T hi cli Time cannot efface.&#xD;
Your deeds, with deeds of all brave men,&#xD;
Your gallant acts shall blend;&#xD;
'Till the bright promise of your lives&#xD;
Its radiance here extends.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the close of this song, Woods was solicited to&#xD;
relate his secret history, since his confinement in&#xD;
Dublin prison; but lie declined entering into par-&#xD;
ticulars, further than to satisfy the curiosity of the&#xD;
company concerning the means taken to convey him&#xD;
away so as to leave no traces.&#xD;
When he left the Dublin prison, lie had previously&#xD;
been drugged, and then placed in a perforated box&#xD;
resembling a coffin, which being placed in another,&#xD;
served to convey m4safely to such places as his&#xD;
enemies found convenient, until they could send hiln&#xD;
to St. Helena; which they finally did. ~XVhmen lie&#xD;
came to his consciousness on board ship, he was put&#xD;
in irons until he reached the island, when he was&#xD;
given in charge of a guard, with very strict orders&#xD;
as to his privileges. He was not allowed to converse&#xD;
witk any but such persons as first received per-&#xD;
niission to address him from his keepers. His situa-&#xD;
tion was very painful, but he did not wish to speak&#xD;
of it-looking at Lady Fredonia-at present, or ever&#xD;
&#xD;
again, if it could be avoided. If Mr. Allen chose to&#xD;
relate the manner of his rescue he could do so.&#xD;
Lund calls for Allen followed, when that gentleman&#xD;
arose, and stated that, as full particulars of his pro-&#xD;
ceedings would involve several brave Irishmen in&#xD;
trouble with the British Government if known, he&#xD;
preferred to observe the silence of Mr. Woods on&#xD;
that subject. It was enough that, after finding out&#xD;
his place of imprisonment, he had been aided by his&#xD;
own countrymen, who contrived to get a suit of sailor's&#xD;
clothing to him, and afford him an opportunity of&#xD;
escape with a company of American sailors who were&#xD;
visiting the island. So well was he disguised that he&#xD;
passed the officials who saw him every day, without&#xD;
detection. His absence being discovered, however,&#xD;
it was guessed where lie could be found; but as Yan-&#xD;
kee oak was known to be as stout as British, he was&#xD;
suffered to go unpursued.&#xD;
Cheers for the Yankee oak: and the following&#xD;
sentiments given:&#xD;
The Realm of Tyrants-May it always be bounded on every side&#xD;
by the sea, and never exceed thirty leagues iii circumference.&#xD;
The People of the United States-As they are personally aware&#xD;
that Johnny Bull is not invincible, may they learn also that his adhe.&#xD;
rents are not infallible.&#xD;
To the Rescuers of John Woods-Wisdom and justice to their coun-&#xD;
cils, and, when required, skill and vigor to their arms.&#xD;
Uncle Sam's best Respects to the generous and good the world&#xD;
over.&#xD;
A Scotch Sea captain's Sentiments to the Enemies of the Uuited&#xD;
States-A leaky ship, a lee shore, an ebb tide, and no anchorage for&#xD;
them.&#xD;
To the Ladies-They animate us to patriotism and glory, and in.&#xD;
spire us with all that dignifies man's nature. Let us cherish them.&#xD;

THE ROMANCE OF AN IRISH GIRL;&#xD;
&#xD;
Lord Potter proposed:&#xD;
A tear and a toast to the memory of American heroes ; and may&#xD;
such names as Washington, Warren, Montgomery and Allen never be&#xD;
forgotten.&#xD;
General Aradell offered:&#xD;
A Republican Government-The glory of free men, the shame of&#xD;
slaves, opposed to monarchy, aristocracy, and despotism.&#xD;
John Woods offered:&#xD;
To our Priends-Their praises are, Jike our affection and gratitude,&#xD;
unspeakably precious.&#xD;
Dr. Henry offered '&#xD;
The Sympathy which the Occasion inspires-May our hearts remain&#xD;
full of it when our glasses are empty.&#xD;
A number of other sentiments were offered by the&#xD;
different guests; and to close the entertainment, Mr.&#xD;
Sumner was called upon to sing the "Star-Spangled&#xD;
Banner," which he did with great expression, the&#xD;
whole company joining in the chorus-.&#xD;
Everybody regretted the absence of Sheldon&#xD;
Brown, whose marriage with a beautiful Boston lady&#xD;
was to take place on the first of June, consequently&#xD;
he could not make one of the party.'&#xD;
The evening closed happily, and if some of the more&#xD;
veteran drinkers, according to English usages, were&#xD;
not so brilliant at the close as at the beginning of the&#xD;
entertainment, to the credit of the Americans be it&#xD;
said, none of them were any too much stimulated for&#xD;
good manners or good sense.&#xD;
The group of ladies had retired before the last&#xD;
song was sung, and the swelling strains of the " Star-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, LIFE IN TWO WORLDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
407&#xD;
&#xD;
Spangled Banner " mingled with the music of their&#xD;
dreams. IDr. Wilkins declared next morning, that he&#xD;
had not known, when listening to that song, whether&#xD;
he was in the body or not.&#xD;
As it was not the intention of the party to remain&#xD;
long in port, business was taken into consideration&#xD;
immediately. According to Marion's request, her&#xD;
father's remains had been removed to London, and&#xD;
were now brought on board ship. A little heap of&#xD;
bones and dust was all there was left of a once great&#xD;
man and father ; but Marion wanted that little in-&#xD;
terred in the free soil of her adopted home. The&#xD;
gentlemen who had come as counsel, except Mr.&#xD;
Sumner, were to remain to transact tihe necessary&#xD;
business concerning tile estate. Tile effect of the&#xD;
writ would be baffled by the united concurrence of all&#xD;
the individuals interested in the matter, and the&#xD;
gentlemen left, prepared for all the intricacies of their&#xD;
business. Lady Fredonia remained with her daughter,&#xD;
while Mrs. Woods was escorted to her home in Ire-&#xD;
land by General Arsdell and Dr. Wilkins. Lord&#xD;
Potter was instructed how to proceed with the case&#xD;
of Annie Stewart Allen; and, in fine, all arrange-&#xD;
ments were made to secure the future peaceful resi-&#xD;
dence of the parties in the United States. The Cun-&#xD;
ningham estate was to be leased for just as much&#xD;
rent as would keep possession, until a certificate of&#xD;
citizenship should enable Woods to return and look&#xD;
after its condition in person, when it would either be&#xD;
sold or put in a better condition for its tenants.&#xD;
Tile third day our party were in port, another&#xD;
steamer, from Halifax, came in, with tile intelligence&#xD;

408      THE I~OMANCE OF AN IRISh GIRL~&#xD;
of the death of Lord Charles Elia. The term for his&#xD;
trial came on about the period of John Woods' ad-&#xD;
vent in New York, and as no one appeared against&#xD;
him, he was discharged. Taking passage in a Ilud-&#xD;
son River steamer, he was annoyed at being recog-&#xD;
nized by some persons on board, and wishing to&#xD;
escape their observation, got off at a landing along&#xD;
the river, where he was almost immediately bitten&#xD;
by a rabid dog. The nature of the bite was not&#xD;
known until after he had embarked for England,&#xD;
when the disease rapidly developed itself, and the&#xD;
unfortunate man died in horrible agony, and was&#xD;
buried in the sea. Surely-&#xD;
"God moves in a mysterious way,&#xD;
His wonders to perform."&#xD;
We have now to bid adieu to our readers~ The&#xD;
subject of this antobiography\qwes much to the kind-&#xD;
ness of the American people. In the j judgment day&#xD;
it cannot be said to them by the poor and oppressed&#xD;
of foreign nations, "I was an hungered, and ye gave&#xD;
me no meat; thirst, and ye gave me no drink;&#xD;
naked, and ye clothed rho not; sick 'and in prison,&#xD;
and ye visited me not." All this have they done,&#xD;
and more, unto many, who, like the author of this&#xD;
book, can bear testimony to their generous hearts&#xD;
and truly Christian principles, practiced as well as&#xD;
professed.&#xD;
