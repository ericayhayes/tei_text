PREFATOTtY AND DEDICATORY.&#xD;
The duties of a soldier in the field give him little&#xD;
time to write r(m'tnces, though he may Jive them, take&#xD;
parts in them, or learn histories from which a hundred&#xD;
noble st :-i:s could be penned. ,Oue of these true his-&#xD;
tories, Vitlh few fanciful additions, is contained in this&#xD;
work, written under circumstances which caused haste,&#xD;
lack of care, and a crudene's which causes me to do&#xD;
what I i hiuum do, apologize for its want of literary&#xD;
merit, wlini I feci a pride in its truth to character and&#xD;
natui e.&#xD;
And I dedicate it to the brave end loyal who still&#xD;
struggle, as I will, in the Army of the United States, un-&#xD;
til the u hole Union is gloriously restored, or we in its&#xD;
defence shall have perished.&#xD;

Sadia'! A lower iii the desert of life ! A&#xD;
seusitive flower! Alas! that such should be&#xD;
'   born in beauty to fill the earth with the frag-&#xD;
rance of their lives, and then to perish beneath&#xD;
our gaze-to die-only with the hope of their&#xD;
hereafter resurrection to keep their worshipers&#xD;
from despair. Why is there no transplanting&#xD;
of material beauty from  the evanescing pres.&#xD;
ent to the eternal future, without earthly decay?&#xD;
The winter winds had swept coldly over one&#xD;
of the love:iest spots in that State which, loy-&#xD;
al to the core, yet mourns the disloyalty of a&#xD;
few of the bravest of her sons and the fairest&#xD;
of her daught ers-noble, staunch old Maryland&#xD;
Ard though the warm breezes (f spring, and&#xD;
F   the sunshine, and gentle,rains had begun to coax&#xD;
out bud and flower from branches and earth,&#xD;
they came slowly, like light breaking half un-&#xD;
willingly through the clefts of a shattered thun-&#xD;
der-cloud. For all Nature seemed to feel that&#xD;
a winter of humanity was at hand, whcn froz-&#xD;
en hearts and souls, steeled into hatred, would&#xD;
refuse to be melted, and clash, with angry bit-&#xD;
-   terness, one against the other.&#xD;
The Potomac, which swept past that old&#xD;
i plantation homestead known as "Springland",&#xD;
and the home of the Montforts, in its steady&#xD;
t&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
It-&#xD;
&#xD;
march to its ocean destiny, moaned sullenly;&#xD;
the music of its ripples grew harsh as they an-&#xD;
swered to the call of the winds which pressed&#xD;
rude lips upon them.&#xD;
And well might it be so. For that river ran&#xD;
as a bopndary-mark between portions of the&#xD;
Union that were now avowedly hostile to each&#xD;
other. The first alarms of a cruel, unnatural,&#xD;
and fratricidal war had been thrown athwart its&#xD;
silvery sheen--its beauty was clouded forever!&#xD;
.said the spot was lovely. So, with its points&#xD;
and surroundings, it was. Upon an eminence,&#xD;
overlooking the river, stood one of those large&#xD;
and roomy mansions peculiar to those portions&#xD;
of Virginia and Maryland which were settled&#xD;
in the early days of our country by the better&#xD;
and more aristocratic class of colonists--man-&#xD;
sions somewhat in the style of the home of&#xD;
Washington, mingling a dash of European state-&#xD;
liness with republican ideas of comfort in their&#xD;
architecture. It had broad piazzas and colon-&#xD;
nades, supported by pillars of Corinthian style ;&#xD;
its windows were wide and lofty ; its dimen-&#xD;
sions sufficient to afford shelter for the retinue&#xD;
of a king.&#xD;
Around it, a grove of forest trees which, in&#xD;
the leafy summer-time, would hide it from view&#xD;
until the visitor was almost at the threshold.&#xD;
Back a little way in its rear, and toward the&#xD;
broad acres of cultivated land which stretched&#xD;
eastward from the river, could be seen the neat&#xD;
village of whitewashed huts, known as the negro-&#xD;
quarters.&#xD;
And away to the right, in a spot where a few&#xD;
lofty pines and other evergreen trees cast a&#xD;
shadow on a neat green sward, stood a small&#xD;
church, built in Gothic style. Newt and tasty,&#xD;
with a gilded cross reared upon the tower, it&#xD;
spoke the faith of those who built it and wor-&#xD;
shiped there.&#xD;
And but a fewyards away was yet another&#xD;
beauty-one of the most graceful aids that Na-&#xD;
ture gives to the mourner to symbolize grief.&#xD;

SADIA.&#xD;

&#xD;
SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
A group of weeping willows, the-carliest-leaved&#xD;
of spring, stood with drooping arms, as senti-&#xD;
nels over the family-graves of the Montforts,&#xD;
the Cliffords, and other gentle families of that&#xD;
section of the State.&#xD;
There were marble slabs anti monuments, on&#xD;
which were graven the names of those who hal&#xD;
been, but were not now -stones on which were&#xD;
writ their merits and their faith ; but grander&#xD;
than the marble handiwork of man stood those&#xD;
drooping monumental trees, which had per-&#xD;
p chance been planted by some one whose duat&#xD;
now enriched the soil that nourished them in&#xD;
their growth.&#xD;
Beneath one of the tallest of these trees, al-&#xD;
most touched by the drooling branches which&#xD;
overhung the tomb against which she leaned,&#xD;
stood Sadia, the heroine of this story.&#xD;
And w8 h that church close by, those bravess&#xD;
of the good and noble at her feet, framed im by&#xD;
those drooping wreaths of sorrow, let her pic-&#xD;
ture be drawn for the reader's eye.&#xD;
Of full medium height, her figure is so fault&#xD;
less that she seems to tower above that stature,&#xD;
even as Mary, Queen of Scots, always looked&#xD;
taller to one at a glance than she really was.&#xD;
Her hair, of a sunny brown, falls in rich care-&#xD;
less curls over a white neck, and shoulders&#xD;
which a sculptor would sigh to copy. IHer&#xD;
eyes, of that dark, changeable blue n+bich inI&#xD;
joyous moments will brighten like ocean's azure&#xD;
in the sunlight, or in sadder hours darken like&#xD;
that sea in the shadow of the night. IIcr fea-&#xD;
tures, rather of the Grecian cast, expressive of&#xD;
great firmness, miirgled with tenderness and&#xD;
love. Yet while we look upon her, there seems&#xD;
to be a shade of everlasting sadness in that face.&#xD;
A smile may come upon, a laugh burst from&#xD;
those full, rosy lips, yet there are marks of the&#xD;
heart-storm within, already showing without.&#xD;
She may be twenty-surely not more. That&#xD;
delicate hand, with but a mourning-ring for its&#xD;
jewel-that slender but perfect form, draped in&#xD;
mourning-robes, as well as the place where she&#xD;
stands, and the expressoim of her face, tell the&#xD;
reader that she grieves for losses that may&#xD;
never be made up, while earth is hers.&#xD;
At a little distance, a young boy and giri are&#xD;
standing, seeming to feel an awe-a fear of ap-&#xD;
proaching the solemn and holy spot where she&#xD;
stands communing with the spirits of the loved&#xD;
who have gone before. Their fe itures show&#xD;
consanguinity ; they evidently are brother and&#xD;
sister to her, though yet in their early child-&#xD;
hood.&#xD;
Reader, you now know Sadia De Montfort-&#xD;
she stands by the side of the tomb in which but&#xD;
a few months previous were laid the mortal re-.&#xD;
mains of both her parents. Descended from an&#xD;
ancient and honorable rce, one n hiei hal held&#xD;
honor and patriotism as caote household jew.-&#xD;
els, they had been called to the Chrstan's&#xD;
home before the clouds of civil n+ar had over-&#xD;
&#xD;
shadowed the land of their birth and love'&#xD;
Blessed fate!&#xD;
Carline and Marion, her younger brother and&#xD;
sister, have cotme with her to the cliuhmeniyari.&#xD;
They stay out in the suTrshine, w tile she seekes&#xD;
the willow's shade in the chilliness of her deep&#xD;
sorrow.&#xD;
But her face flushes up while we are looking&#xD;
tt her ; the sigh which tremuhijled on her pjs i&#xD;
hushed back into the silence ofl her boso.n, and&#xD;
an almost angry flush darts from her ey es, as&#xD;
she observes two gentleiien approch the spot.&#xD;
"They inighit at least have h t wec   lie&#xD;
alone over my dead !'' she muriureh, ns she&#xD;
walked away from among the gra es toward the&#xD;
persons allided to, who paused outside the lit-&#xD;
tle churchyard on the lawn which fronted the&#xD;
A glance at these intruders before she meets&#xD;
the m.&#xD;
One-the elder of the two-~has a look which,&#xD;
though differing in most respects from hers, still&#xD;
exhibits sufficient resemblance to prove blood-&#xD;
relationship. He is tall, finely formed, with&#xD;
good features. But his expression is inuicative&#xD;
of a passionate and vindictive character. Firm-&#xD;
ness, to obstinacy, can be seen in the down-drawn&#xD;
corners of his thin lips. his age must be thirty,&#xD;
perhaps more ; for he has lived well, and it ia&#xD;
hard to tell the age of a fast liver at a glance.&#xD;
Nd matter for his age; we introduce to you&#xD;
Waiburton Do Moutfort, elder brother of Sadia,&#xD;
and one who assumes to himself the control of&#xD;
the es-ate of Springland, and all upon it ; for&#xD;
his father died suddenly and without a will, and&#xD;
lie at once assumed control as the senior heir.&#xD;
Though there is much that is cold, haughty,&#xD;
and unlovable in him, yet there is that also&#xD;
there which we cannot find in his companion-&#xD;
manhood-open, out-looking manhood.&#xD;
That companion is his cousin, Sadia's cousin,&#xD;
Mr. Randolph Beverly, lately of the United&#xD;
States Navy, who has resigned from that service&#xD;
because the "Mother of Presidents" and the&#xD;
IHailot of Nullification have chosen to com-&#xD;
mence a quarrel in the Union family, and he&#xD;
thinks his services may be needed in the lap of&#xD;
the one or at the apron-strings of the other.&#xD;
While he was in the Navy, and before treason&#xD;
was known to be lurking under the flag which&#xD;
he served, he visited Springland, was received&#xD;
cordially by his aunt and uncle, then living, and&#xD;
especially that he was the son of the only sister&#xD;
(already deceased) of Mrs. De Montfort, received&#xD;
front her every token of love and esteem. lie,&#xD;
wiimh the susceptibility of a sailor who is sup-&#xD;
posed to find a sweetheart in every port, fell&#xD;
deeply in love with l'us cousin Sada ; and that&#xD;
love, or passion it might be, he yet clung to,&#xD;
with more than a sailor's constancy.&#xD;
But his character was what we commenced to&#xD;
study. ills ready disloyalty to the flag which&#xD;
Ihe had sworn to serve ; his ingratitude to tie&#xD;
&#xD;
country which had educated him, were shown&#xD;
by his d1. rtintg both before the warcloud of&#xD;
Rebelhon had iore than risen above the hori-&#xD;
zon. A look at his small black eyes, which&#xD;
moved restlessly all the time and never were&#xD;
for a iulmentf xed, even wben he was speaking,&#xD;
upon those of tme person whom he addressed,&#xD;
would tell the sttudenit of human character that&#xD;
be was treneberous and cowardly ; his foppish-&#xD;
ness of dress and mnae4ier spoke of vanity with-&#xD;
out fouml aion ; in short, he was a l)cprson whose&#xD;
stock of m:inhood was l:tmentably deficient, not-&#xD;
wi thsta  ilLn the "good blood" hycame from.&#xD;
It ial (lettenior  ted in the channel.&#xD;
And de iOed1der. o have a pretty fair pic-&#xD;
ture of three of my most important characters&#xD;
-the angel, the mortal, amid the fiend. Let us&#xD;
sec how we '; ill get along with them ?&#xD;
 ot iindmig  on at the house, after our re-&#xD;
turn from the mirung s ride,we walked in search&#xD;
of } on, s  r "' e5ud the brother.  '"Cousin&#xD;
Bev &amp;amp;ly lcav s to morrow for Charleston, and&#xD;
wishs to be w\vih you as much as possible be.&#xD;
fure lie goeS!P&#xD;
Sadia bowel, but did not trust herself with a&#xD;
reply ; or the sad emotions which had made her&#xD;
queenl y Thrm g iver, while she stood by those&#xD;
dear graves, had not passed away.&#xD;
SYes, f'ur cousin, \Varburton speaks truly !"&#xD;
said the young ex-officer. "I have been in-&#xD;
formed that a coiunwssion waits for me from&#xD;
our new Government, and I expect soon to be&#xD;
again afloat to defend Southern rights against&#xD;
Iort hern oppression, and to teach the coward-&#xD;
ly Yankees what the blood of the nation's chiv-&#xD;
airy can do !"&#xD;
A strangely-scornful smile passed over the&#xD;
face of  'adia, but still she made no reply.&#xD;
"Beverly will jomn the Navy, and I the&#xD;
Army !" said W::rburton, rather nervously, for&#xD;
he did neot like the quiet way in which his sister&#xD;
received the information given. " For now that&#xD;
Sumter has surrendered, and the Abolition Pres-&#xD;
ident called for troops, there must Le war, and,&#xD;
for a short time, plenty of it, until the Yankees&#xD;
see we are in earnest, and then they'll be as&#xD;
anxious to cry for peace as they are now for&#xD;
war."&#xD;
Sadia heard this, and still made no reply.&#xD;
"You do not seem to be much interested&#xD;
either in us or the struggle upon which we are&#xD;
about to enter, fair cousin!" said the young&#xD;
aspirant for naval honors.&#xD;
" When men arc rising in rebellion against&#xD;
the Gov rnmeut which they have sworn to sus-&#xD;
tain ; when they turn ungratefully upon the&#xD;
mother who has nurtured them ; they need not&#xD;
expect those who love their whole country and&#xD;
its dear old flag, to feel any great personal in-&#xD;
terest for thenm and none of that favorable to&#xD;
them or their treasonable cause !"&#xD;
And now those dark flashing eyes spoke as&#xD;
well as Sadia's lips, telling him how unmeasur-&#xD;
&#xD;
G&#xD;
&#xD;
able scorn could be, when felt by a brave and&#xD;
patt'iotic woman, looking upon treachery and&#xD;
cowardice,&#xD;
And he, turning pale with emotion, and a&#xD;
petty anger which'a spirit so mean as his could&#xD;
not suppress, exclaimed&#xD;
Treason to the Confederacy can be punished&#xD;
in a woman as well as a man!&#xD;
I am aware, Sir," she replied scornfully,&#xD;
"that martyrs are ahvays found in a good cause,&#xD;
no matter what their sex may be ! And I would&#xD;
prefer the honor of martyrdom for the Union,&#xD;
than a queenly position upon the black throne&#xD;
of treason "&#xD;
"Sister Sadia-I would thank you to forbear&#xD;
these gratuitous insults to our cousin-the day&#xD;
may come when you will bitterly rue them 1"&#xD;
and the flush of anger darkened the cheeks of&#xD;
the brother as he spoke.&#xD;
"If my sentiments are distateful to Randolph&#xD;
Beverly, he can easily avoid hearing them. I&#xD;
never seek his presence. And now you wil1&#xD;
certainly excuse my fu tlher attendance, for I&#xD;
wish to see my little brother and sister safely to&#xD;
our desolate home.  Thank heaven they are&#xD;
too young to mix with treason !&#xD;
I think Marion will make a most acceptable&#xD;
midshipman in the vessel to which I shall be&#xD;
attached. I had intended to make the propo-&#xD;
sition to Warburton earlier than this, for the&#xD;
South in this struggle will need every available&#xD;
person !" said young Beverly, in a sarcastic tone.&#xD;
"Never, never !" cried Sadia, indignantly.&#xD;
"That boy and poor little Canine are all that&#xD;
is left for me to love, protect, and cherish. And&#xD;
if Warburton carries out his mad intention of&#xD;
joining the Southern Army, I shall make them&#xD;
my sole charge, and in some yet loyal part of&#xD;
the Union try to preserve them from the ills of&#xD;
a cruel and too heartless world !"&#xD;
"I think, most-interesting sister, that my&#xD;
consent will be found necessary for such a step,&#xD;
not only as the head of the family, but one who&#xD;
will not permit their young hearts to be turned&#xD;
away from 'their own sunny South.  I will not&#xD;
attempt to control your political tastes, how-&#xD;
ever mad they may be, but I will take charge&#xD;
of the children !'&#xD;
"It will be very easy for you to care for them,&#xD;
Sir, when you are fighting against the flag which&#xD;
our dear father almost worshiped !"&#xD;
"If I cannot pay the attention to them which&#xD;
their youth make necessary, gold can hire re-&#xD;
quisite attendants-gold can purchase truth&#xD;
against treason !"&#xD;
"Yes, the truth of an Arnold or an Iscariot!&#xD;
I will not parley longer with a brother so un-&#xD;
natural. Come, Marion and Canine, come to&#xD;
the house with your poor sister !','&#xD;
The two children, who had been listening-hal&#xD;
terrified to the angry conversation about? theme&#xD;
selves, closed up to their sister like young birds&#xD;
seeking a mother's protection, aud hurried away&#xD;

SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
from their dark-browed brother, whose tones&#xD;
bad never been kind to them.&#xD;
And be and his scheming cousin stood abash-&#xD;
ed by her indignant words and loo!:s, until&#xD;
she had passed beyond the hearing of their&#xD;
Voices.&#xD;
Then young Beverly said in a bitter tone&#xD;
"The hopes which you have encouraged in&#xD;
my heart of an alliance with your sister, do not&#xD;
seem to stand upon a very firm foundation&#xD;
now 1"&#xD;
"She acts and talks like a fool. But if you&#xD;
care as much for her as your words hitherto&#xD;
have indicated, you will not let a woman's whims&#xD;
er weakness thwart you in your wishes. The&#xD;
very hint which you gave of getting Marion in-&#xD;
to the naval service with you, struck terror into&#xD;
her heart. I will give my consent to his going,&#xD;
and only withdraw it on one condition."&#xD;
"And that'"&#xD;
"is the Fulfillment on her part of the engage-&#xD;
ment which I have made for her. If she be-&#xD;
9omes your wife, I will have her here in full&#xD;
possession of the old homestead, whie I go to&#xD;
Flo my share in clearing out the invaders of our&#xD;
homes, and the destroyers of our ancient rights&#xD;
and privileges. If not, she shall leave that&#xD;
home as a wanderer, for I will not be trifled&#xD;
with. And I will force her to a determination&#xD;
this night !"&#xD;
"If I was not bound off so soon, Warburton,&#xD;
I would deprecate your haste. As it is, I feel&#xD;
too much interested in the matter to ask for de-&#xD;
lay. If she refuses the proffer which I author-&#xD;
ize you to make of my haud and name, then&#xD;
give me Marion for a companion, and see what&#xD;
a sailor I'll make of him1"&#xD;
"lRent satisfied, Beverly.  The matter shall&#xD;
be brought to a crisis this night. And now let&#xD;
us go up to the old mansion and try some of&#xD;
the peach and honey which my father left for&#xD;
the especial benefit of myself and friends. The&#xD;
angry words I have uttered and have listened&#xD;
to, have made me as dry as an Eastern shore&#xD;
herring."&#xD;
"Of course I'll join you, cousin. When a&#xD;
sailor refuses grog you may consider the end&#xD;
of the world at hand."&#xD;
And the cousins followed the same path taken&#xD;
by Sadia, leading to the old mansion.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
It was but a couple of hours later when Sadia&#xD;
De Moutfort, seated in her own quiet chamber&#xD;
in the mansion wherein she had seen her hap-&#xD;
piest as well as her saddest days, was intruded&#xD;
upon by her brother, who had come to perform&#xD;
the promise made to his heartless cousin.&#xD;
"I have come, Sadia," said he, upon entering&#xD;
the room, "to know your final decision in re-&#xD;
gard to the proposal made for your hand by&#xD;
1andolph Beverly. lIe 18800n to leave us, but&#xD;
&#xD;
cannot go without knowing whether you in-&#xD;
tend to listen to his suit or not."&#xD;
Then lie need not dt lav his departure au&#xD;
hour ." replied the lady, scorn flushing her&#xD;
lovely face. "I despise him and his sit, and&#xD;
never, under an y circumstances, would I listen&#xD;
to the thought of linking my fate with that of a&#xD;
traitor to his flag and couiuy f Tlhaut is my an-&#xD;
swer-the sooner he departs,~the Letter it will be&#xD;
for my peace."&#xD;
"Perhaps not, Miss Obstinacy! If he goes,&#xD;
our Marion goes with him to serve in the  iavv&#xD;
of the Confederacy."&#xD;
"You use that threat to alter my determina-&#xD;
tion, Warburton. It is useless. Yio dare not&#xD;
let my little brother go from the roof-tree where&#xD;
his brave and loyal father lived iin honor, and&#xD;
died respected."&#xD;
"I dare anything! You know my nature&#xD;
well, and that I allow no obstacle to thwart my&#xD;
will, foolish girl!"&#xD;
You may dare much of evil, Warburton,&#xD;
but nothing so unmanly as to carry out your&#xD;
threat with the vain hope of coercing ue into a&#xD;
hated marriage"&#xD;
" You will see, and that before another sun&#xD;
rises !" he replied, moodily. "If you bear to&#xD;
lose the company of your last relative s on earth,&#xD;
you are more stubborn than wise. I intend to&#xD;
go South to-morrow morning,, and before going,&#xD;
to close'tlis louse. The children and their serv-&#xD;
ants wil[ go with me. You can remain iin sol-&#xD;
itude, or go as the affianced brde of one more&#xD;
than worthy of you."&#xD;
"Affianced or wedded, I will not go, Warbur-&#xD;
toni; nor can you tear my little brother and&#xD;
sister from me without first destroying my hfe I&#xD;
Beware of making me despe! ate! As hot blood&#xD;
runs in my veins as flows in your own, and&#xD;
despair will lend a double strength to my&#xD;
arm."&#xD;
"A woman's threats are always id'e," was&#xD;
Warburton's contemptuous reply, as he rose and&#xD;
left the room.&#xD;
"God help me !" sighed poor Sadia, when she&#xD;
stood alone in her chamber. For she knew that&#xD;
a firm will and a strong power were opposed to&#xD;
her. And though she would not show weakncsa&#xD;
in the presence of her persecutors, she felt&#xD;
more than she was willing to admit.&#xD;
"I must be beforehand with Warburton in&#xD;
his intended removal of the children, or they&#xD;
are, indeed, lost to me," she said. "I have but&#xD;
little money at my command, and, alas! few&#xD;
friends to trust. I think old Hunter would&#xD;
serve me for the sake of past kindnesses. Him&#xD;
I will try, at any rate. lie is faithful and cun-&#xD;
ning by report, though not as wise as some of&#xD;
our neighbors."&#xD;
And the lady made quiet preparations for&#xD;
leaving the house upon a nocturnal visit to the&#xD;
o-nly one whom she thought could help her in&#xD;
her difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
BADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Down by the side of the rushing river, not a&#xD;
mile from the mansion already described in our&#xD;
first chapter, stood a small and rude log hut,&#xD;
ouilt partially into the side of the steep bank&#xD;
-rhich overlooked the water. Upon a small&#xD;
-lateau in front, barely above high-water mark,&#xD;
i couple of small skiffs, of the kind used by fish-&#xD;
ermen on the river, were drawn up. There was&#xD;
no sign of a garden, or any of the usual com-&#xD;
forts appertaining even to the poorest and&#xD;
humblest houses in that section. A fishiog-net,&#xD;
and some poles and lines, hung under the out-&#xD;
jutting eaves of the hut, told the occupation of&#xD;
its sole inmate.&#xD;
But we must look in upon him to judge of&#xD;
his character, and learn that he has a part to&#xD;
play in the life-drama which you, reader, are&#xD;
now glancing at.&#xD;
At the same hour when Sadia De Montfort&#xD;
was sighing for help in her troubles, the inmate&#xD;
of this hut, known generally as Old Hunter, the&#xD;
Fisherman, was eating his supper of fish and&#xD;
hoe-cake, cooked by his own hands. He was a&#xD;
man whose white hairs told of at least sixty&#xD;
years of life, if not more ; whose face, bronzed&#xD;
by the exposure to the weather, had many a&#xD;
care-furrow worn into it. His dress was rough,&#xD;
but neat and tidy, and there was that unmistak-&#xD;
able look of natural nobility -upon his care-&#xD;
worn face, which would tell the most careless&#xD;
observer that he had not always dwelt in a hut&#xD;
or fished for a living. Though the furniture of&#xD;
the but was rude and scanty, a shelf containing&#xD;
quite a little library of books, a few superior en-&#xD;
gravings hung upon the log walls, told that the&#xD;
tastes and temporary occupation of Thomas&#xD;
Hunter were widely different. While sitting by a&#xD;
rude table, no person would observe any deform-&#xD;
ity in his tall, erect figure ; but when he rose to&#xD;
cross the room to his rude fire-place, to replen-&#xD;
ish he tin cup from which he drank his tea, a&#xD;
limp in his gait betrayed a lameness which seri-&#xD;
ously incapacitated him from rapid locomotion.&#xD;
There was one thing upon his walls, so unusual&#xD;
in such a place, that it cannot be passed by un-&#xD;
noticed. It was an oil-painting, evidently the&#xD;
work of a master-hand, representing the scene of&#xD;
a duel, in which one of the combatants had fal-&#xD;
len, and the other stood by the side of the dying&#xD;
man, with an expression of grief and remorse&#xD;
upon his face, which only an artist of rare genius&#xD;
could depict. And, in the face of the survivor,&#xD;
though looking much younger, there was a&#xD;
striking resemblance to Thomas Hunter. The&#xD;
seconds and principals seemed to be men of&#xD;
fashion in their day, and the scenery which&#xD;
made up the back-ground of the picture was&#xD;
picturesque in the extreme. A mountain in the&#xD;
distance, a smooth, silver-faced lake close at&#xD;
hand, and the forest trees, tinged with October's&#xD;
golden and scarlet hues, made up this back&#xD;
t' ground to so sad a scene. The man who bad&#xD;
fallen still grasped his pistol in hand, but the&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
one who stood erect had cast his down upon&#xD;
the grass, as if he detested the weapon which&#xD;
had been the instrument of death in his hand.&#xD;
The strangest thing of all about the hut was, that&#xD;
not a thing living but Thomas Hunter could be&#xD;
seen about the premises, neither dcg nor cat,&#xD;
nor even a bird to keep the solitary company.&#xD;
There are few in the world who have not some&#xD;
living thing to pet-those who have not are in-&#xD;
deed desolate ; and though the world were full&#xD;
of thornless flowers, it would be a desert to&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Having finished his evening meal by the light&#xD;
of his wood fire, he removed the single plate,&#xD;
knife, fork, and cup which made up his table.&#xD;
furniture, and lightning' an ordinary oil-lamp,&#xD;
took one of the books from the shelf, and sat&#xD;
down to read. His eyes had, however, scarcely&#xD;
rested upon the first opened page when a&#xD;
sound outside, almost as light as the rustling'of&#xD;
leaves, attracted his attention. Hastily rising to&#xD;
his feet, he placed his hand to his breast, as if&#xD;
upon some concealed weapon, and advanced&#xD;
noiselessly to the only door in the hut-for it&#xD;
contained but that one room. Before he got to&#xD;
the door, a light and timid knock reached his&#xD;
ears.&#xD;
"Who is there ?" he asked in a gruff and&#xD;
husky voice. "Who wants to see poor old&#xD;
Tom Hunter at this time of night ?"&#xD;
"A friend-and that friend a woman in dis-&#xD;
tress 1" was the reply, in tones which trembled,&#xD;
either from weakness or excitement.&#xD;
"Perhaps a decoy of that brave Vigilance&#xD;
Committee, which came and took from the poor&#xD;
old man the rusty musket that he had to shoot&#xD;
a duck with once in a while 1" he responded, in a&#xD;
tone of sarcastic bitterness.&#xD;
"No, Mr. Hunter, no; but one who was al-&#xD;
ways welcome winter before last, when you&#xD;
could not move for the rheumatism that made&#xD;
you helpless."&#xD;
" Your voice sounds like that of Sadia De&#xD;
Montfort, and though her father was my best&#xD;
friend while he lived, I have been warned to&#xD;
leave this, my home, for years by his son, War-&#xD;
burton!"&#xD;
"I fly from the persecutions of that brother&#xD;
now! and I come to ask you to help me in my&#xD;
dark hour of need !# was the response, in bolder&#xD;
and more earnest tones.&#xD;
"It is she; I will risk opening the door at&#xD;
any rate !" said the old man.&#xD;
And he withdrew a massive oaken bar which&#xD;
f would have withheld the strength of many men,&#xD;
and lifted the wooden latch, which still closed&#xD;
it.&#xD;
Sadia, pale and tremulous from excitement, at&#xD;
t once entered the apartment. Hunter immedi-&#xD;
ately recognized her, and his manner of caution&#xD;
changed to that of-deep and deferential respect,&#xD;
"Forgive my doubts, kind lady ; but dark&#xD;
and perilous times have come upon the coun-&#xD;

&#xD;
try, and harmless as my life has been here, it is&#xD;
now threatened by more than one bad man."   l&#xD;
"I know it, Mr. Hunter; and the reason, you1&#xD;
are true to the flag which my father never&#xD;
would have deserted had he lived. The flag of&#xD;
Washington, of Jackson, of Jefferson, and all&#xD;
good patriots."&#xD;
"True, Miss" Sadia! I fought, when a mere&#xD;
child, under that flag against British wrongs. I'&#xD;
am too old to desert it because home-traitors&#xD;
threaten it. But I have no time to speak of&#xD;
myself or .my own .perils now. You said that&#xD;
you were in distress. Tell me how I can serve&#xD;
you, and the old man, who would long since&#xD;
have died but for the unasked Tindness of your&#xD;
parents and yourself, will try to prove that his&#xD;
world-chilled heart has yet the fire of gratitude&#xD;
unquenched in it !"&#xD;
"My brother has been trying to force me in-&#xD;
to a revolting marriage with my cousin Ran-&#xD;
dolph Beverly, who has just received a commis-&#xD;
sion in the Rebel Navy. To persecute me into&#xD;
a compliance with his wishes he threatens to&#xD;
remove my brother and sister from my care-&#xD;
to place poor Marion in the Rebel Navy. I&#xD;
wish to save them and myself. To do so, I&#xD;
must start witi them for Baltimore this night.&#xD;
Once there, I- have friends who will protect&#xD;
them and myself. Can you help me? Do not&#xD;
pause to consider, but think that God will aid&#xD;
all of us; say yes, and prepare to take me&#xD;
away."               ,r&#xD;
Thomas Hunter did pause a moment; in that&#xD;
moment he looked at the painting which I have&#xD;
partially described; glanced around the room,&#xD;
where he had spent many a sadly and there-&#xD;
fore happily quiet hour, then, with a sigh, he&#xD;
answered :&#xD;
"I knew I would have to go, but did not ex-&#xD;
pect to go so soon, or to have to protect others&#xD;
than myself. I will go ; your lives are precious;&#xD;
mine is not. Yours I will save, or-lose my own&#xD;
in the attempt; and then the God of the inno-&#xD;
cent must help you. My boat is light, but it&#xD;
can carry you three; for by the river only can&#xD;
we escape. Once at Washington and past the&#xD;
pickets and guerrillas which already line the&#xD;
rver, you can easily reach Baltimore; and I&#xD;
will be near one who may remember the boy&#xD;
who was wounded by his side at Lundy's Lane,&#xD;
and after the war shot his best friend for speak-&#xD;
ing idly of his fame. I believe Winfiehd Scott&#xD;
will not forget me when, in my old age, I ten-&#xD;
der what is left of me in a cause which he, a&#xD;
loyal Virginian, defends !"&#xD;
"No; he will reward your loyalty, and all&#xD;
that poor Sadia can do to reward your services&#xD;
shall be done. 3ut I must hurry back, for I may&#xD;
be missed from the house, my steps watched,&#xD;
and we should fail."&#xD;
"Yes ; go quickly, lady-bring no baggage.&#xD;
But bring some arms and ammunition, if you&#xD;
can, for I have only a knife to defend our party&#xD;
&#xD;
with, and it is a poor weapon in an old man's&#xD;
hand against odds. Do not be gone over two&#xD;
hours; for then the moon goes down, and we&#xD;
can embark in darkness, and be far away before&#xD;
day dawns. While you are gone, I shall con-&#xD;
ceal all that I value here, and be ready the&#xD;
moment you come. Bring warm clothing upon&#xD;
yourself and the children, but no provisions.&#xD;
My hooks and line will find us food till we are&#xD;
beyond danger, if we pass it at all !"&#xD;
Sadia made no reply ; time was too precious&#xD;
for words; she merely pressed the brave old&#xD;
man's hand, and hurried out into the stilncss of&#xD;
the night to return to the mansion where she&#xD;
had once reigned the Queen of Beauty, Love,&#xD;
and Light.&#xD;
"God bless her! it may be the last act of a&#xD;
sad life ; but my sun will go down into the val-&#xD;
ley of death bright to the last, if I am serving&#xD;
her !" murmured the old man. And he then&#xD;
reclosed his door, and began to conceal in a,,&#xD;
secret cavity under his broad hearthstone vari-&#xD;
ous articles. Among them, carefully wrapping&#xD;
it in an old canvas sail, was the oil paintng we&#xD;
have before alluded to. Leaving him thus en-&#xD;
gaged, we will travel elsewhere, for we have&#xD;
many scenes to witness, and but brief space to&#xD;
do it in.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
In a room furnished gorgeously, but in far&#xD;
different style from that of Sadiz, her brother&#xD;
found Randolph  Beverly, when he returned ,&#xD;
from his last threatening interview with his&#xD;
sister. In it a side-board, covered with spark-&#xD;
ling decanters and glasses, occupiei.a prominent "&#xD;
position.  Boxes of cigars, arms, and imple-&#xD;
ments of sport, hung or were scattered careless-&#xD;
ly around. The appearance of thp room indi-&#xD;
cated the taste of him who there m t his friends.&#xD;
Beverly was sitting by the marble centre table,&#xD;
discussing practically the respective merits of&#xD;
some rich old wine, and a principle cigar, and&#xD;
seemed so pleased with the occupation, that he&#xD;
hardly turned his head to greet the messenger&#xD;
whose mission had been so import:a':t so far as&#xD;
regarded the hopes and desires of the young&#xD;
onieer.&#xD;
Warburton looked rather piqued at the utter;&#xD;
coolness of his cousin, not thinkig that his own,&#xD;
blood ran so hot from the obstinaey  iicli had.&#xD;
just defied him.&#xD;
"You seem to be enjoying yourself. Beverly !",,&#xD;
said he, rather tartly. "If I were to tell vout&#xD;
that Sadia is as haughtily defiant to m y wishes&#xD;
and your own, in spite of a I threats, it miglrt&#xD;
lessen your pleasure !"&#xD;
"Not at all, dear Cousin Warburton. In love:&#xD;
as well as war, the most heroic meet reverses,&#xD;
and their best claim to heroism in both cases is'&#xD;
to meet them with the stoicism  of an Indian.&#xD;

my dear boy, is strong in my heart yet; and this&#xD;
delicious old wine is not calculated to depress&#xD;

"I should think not. I will try a glass or&#xD;

" Eut it does this wine ; it is as mellow as a&#xD;

I suppose from your language you know&#xD;

"Saiiors Know a great deal which they never&#xD;

The last question was addressed to an intel-&#xD;

entered the i oo'u, hat in hand.&#xD;
Ile raised his hand to the locks of grizzly&#xD;
grey which bordered his high but narrow fore&#xD;

as niatuial to a Southern negro as it is to a&#xD;

"Tank you, Mara'r-tank you. Die am do&#xD;

And the old darkey went off smacking his&#xD;
thick lips over the beverage which he so highly&#xD;
praised.&#xD;
"That nigger has been worth more than any&#xD;
dozen we ever had on the place," said Warbur-&#xD;
ton. "After father died, when I paw things were&#xD;
darkening up between us and the North, I dis-&#xD;
charged our Yankee overseer, and put Nap in&#xD;
his place. The old rip has got more work out&#xD;
of the boys by half than the Yankee did, and&#xD;
licked them less. But he has used a little more&#xD;
applejack, and meal, and bacon. Ie thinks if&#xD;
a nigger can get all he wants to eat and drink&#xD;
by working for it, he'll work; and I believe in&#xD;
his policy."&#xD;
aI shall not dispute it, only I believe a little&#xD;
flogging enlivens men up once in a while. When&#xD;
we had flogging and grog in the old Navy, we&#xD;
had better seamen than when both were abol-&#xD;
ished."&#xD;
"You are talking of white men-I of nig-&#xD;
gers."&#xD;
"Of course; but I don't make much difference&#xD;
in my ideas of a poor white man and a nigger.&#xD;
I always treat them about the same, only the&#xD;
nigger the best, when there is a choice."&#xD;
"If our niggers could be trusted with arms,&#xD;
we would soon end this war. But if we give&#xD;
them arms, and make them believe they are as&#xD;
good as white men, that will be the last use they'll&#xD;
ever be to us."&#xD;
"Of course ; and he'll never be so foolish as to&#xD;
do it."&#xD;
"But what if the Yankees arm them?"&#xD;
"We must keep them out of Yankee hands.&#xD;
That is what I shall do, and every true friend to&#xD;
the South and Southern rights will do the&#xD;
same."&#xD;
"I hope so. Pass a fresh decanter from the&#xD;
side-board, Warburton. If we're to keep a night-&#xD;
watch, we must keep our lips wet, or our eyes&#xD;
will close."&#xD;
"There's no need of keeping any night-watch&#xD;
on our part. Old Nap is faithful, and I will&#xD;
have orders for us to be called an hour before&#xD;
daylight. We can then breakfast, and be on the&#xD;
road by sunrise."&#xD;
" As you like. .I'll take another glass, and&#xD;
turn in, for one watch below is better than three&#xD;
on deck."&#xD;
And the already half-tipsy son of Neptune&#xD;
took another smile, bade his cousin good-night,&#xD;
and went to his room humming a part of an old&#xD;
naval drinking-song.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
When Sadia reached the back-door of the&#xD;

mansion, on her return from her visit to the old&#xD;
fishernai's but, she suddenly and une xpecteC'ly&#xD;
encounter d old Napoleon- as he was returning&#xD;
from his visit to his master'3 room. II recog-&#xD;
nized lien by the light of the tin lantern which&#xD;
he carried in his lia nd, and taking off his hat,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
Is von gittin' ready, too, Missy Sidv ?"&#xD;
Geuing ready for what, Nalpoleon ?" she&#xD;
asked, seeing by his marnner that somnethiog im&#xD;
portant was on his mind.                 .&#xD;
Why, do moving' in le mornn--de moving'&#xD;
ob ebberyting and ebberybody.    Dat's what&#xD;
Mars'r Warburtoi tole me to git ready for."&#xD;
Did ho tell you why this moving was to take&#xD;
place&#xD;
"Yes, Missy Sady. He said de Yankees was&#xD;
a coin' to hang all us niggers, and put de white&#xD;
folks in jail."&#xD;
Well, you may believe him, Napoleon. lie&#xD;
is your master ; but lie will not include me in&#xD;
his moving. I shall not go with him"&#xD;
"Why, Missy, you wouldn't let the Yankees&#xD;
put you in jail ?"&#xD;
"No, Napoleon, they will never do it.  In-&#xD;
stead of hanging the negroes, they would set&#xD;
them free. But I do not wish to interfere with&#xD;
my brother's arrangements ; you do as lie bade&#xD;
you. I can look out for myself."&#xD;
"What, Missy, wid all do hands done gone&#xD;
'away?  Datll nebber do! Doesn't you 'mem-&#xD;
ber dat my Silla is your old nurse, dat has al-&#xD;
ways been wid you since you was a baby. And&#xD;
didn't your good ole fader tell her an' inc dat we&#xD;
must nebber lobe you till we died."&#xD;
"Yes, Napoleon. I remember all that. And&#xD;
you and Priscilla have ever been f.ithfil to me.&#xD;
I shall be sorry to part with you; but if you go&#xD;
South with my bro' her, we liiust part."&#xD;
"By golly! I des n't want to go no furder&#xD;
Souf dan I is now. I Lues dis ole place-I likes&#xD;
ebberyting about it, and I don'r half belebe all&#xD;
I've heard, no way. I wish you'd tellie what&#xD;
to do, Miss Sady ?  I feel as if I belonged to&#xD;
you more dan anybody else, and mg Siia does&#xD;
all belong to you. An'all de people on,de )lace&#xD;
tub you, Miss Sady, 'cause, since you was a lilly&#xD;
gal, you had a smile an' a kind word for 'em&#xD;
ebbery day, and nebber forgot 'em while de&#xD;
Chrismas log was burning .  You jess tell us&#xD;
what to do, and see if we don't do it now!"&#xD;
Where did you leave my broth her ?" was&#xD;
Sadia's question, after a moms it's reflection.&#xD;
"Up in his room wid slat drinkin' ossifer,&#xD;
Mars'r Beverly-bofe of 'em 'carryin' 'bout as&#xD;
much as dey could hold."&#xD;
"Do you think they twill be out again to-&#xD;
ighit "&#xD;
" No, Missy Sady. Cause dey lebe all for&#xD;
dis chile to do 'bout gitt in'ready fe a start."&#xD;
"Then, Napoleon, if I can trust you I will&#xD;
tell you a scret-"&#xD;
"You ist can trust me, Missy Sady. You&#xD;
&#xD;
I nebber spoke a cross word to me in all your&#xD;
life, you tink I not be true to ole Mars'r's favo-&#xD;
rite chile? I cut out my tongfue before I tell&#xD;
anything she tell me not to tell&#xD;
S"I will tell you then, Napoleon. Mv li'broth-&#xD;
er wishes me to marry that drunken cousin of&#xD;
his. I will not."&#xD;
"  o wonder, Missy Sady.   You is goo(1&#xD;
enough for Ginral Ja:ckson, or any o.l lcr great&#xD;
man; and I tink Mars'r Boverly am poor trash&#xD;
any way !"'&#xD;
Do not interrupt me ngain, Napoleon, but&#xD;
, hear all I have got to say."&#xD;
"Yes, Missy Sady. I is all 'tention.'&#xD;
Your master, my     brother W)arburton,&#xD;
wants to force me to ih's marriage, Ib ciarry-&#xD;
ing you all ofi, and takihI my litle brother&#xD;
and sister with him, too. rThem I will save by&#xD;
carrying them away to a safe place this very&#xD;
iiight. I have already made arranr enients for&#xD;
it. TI'hat is the secret I was going to tell you.&#xD;
You will not btrav me, I know.''&#xD;
t " NoMissy Sad, not nebber. But it seems&#xD;
to me like a new light was breaking out afore&#xD;
me. I didn't half liketde hm ry Mari' War-&#xD;
burton seemed to be in. And den he gib me&#xD;
a glass of brandy, an' prowe'cd miie a whole bot--&#xD;
tie on de road to-morrow. 'Inebber knew him&#xD;
do so much as dat afore for me, and 've worked&#xD;
harder dan any mule on de place for hint since&#xD;
your good ole fodder died. Dere's samlin' in&#xD;
de Bible dat I've heard 'ei talk about de deh-&#xD;
b1l tempting' folk:.  I reckon dat bottle of&#xD;
brandy was meant to teimpt dis idgger to do&#xD;
wrong. Derefore, and because I doesn't t'iuk&#xD;
I shadl hab dat bout, to-moirow, 'cause I mean&#xD;
to fly from de temptation. Jest w:.rc  oui go,&#xD;
Miss Sady, dis chile and his ole vife SUa will&#xD;
go. Dat am a spoken fact! DIs chile sees de&#xD;
light, and it is where you goes, an' he'll fuller&#xD;
dat light sure. And (lere's more dan me will&#xD;
go too wid you, Missy Sady."&#xD;
Sadia, who expected no aid but that of old&#xD;
Hunter in her intended fight, was at a loss&#xD;
what to say or do now. She well knew how&#xD;
faithful all of her father's oli servants were to&#xD;
her ; sihe kucw, too, that if the plans of her&#xD;
brother were carried out, they would be taken&#xD;
into a worse servitude-probably sold to help&#xD;
the treasury of a disloyal Confederacy, or used&#xD;
in some way to aid in carrying on a cruel and&#xD;
unholy war, which her nobie and loyal heai t&#xD;
could only look upon with horror. And she&#xD;
thought that it might be in. her power to arrest&#xD;
their destiny ; but in attempting 'to do so, she&#xD;
might fail ; and if she did, she might lose the&#xD;
little brother and sister whose safety was now&#xD;
her main care.&#xD;
All of these things Miassed rapidly through her&#xD;
mind, and she hesitated what to do.&#xD;
"Missy Sady, what am   de trouble, for dis&#xD;
chile sees that some n trouble your mind right&#xD;
smart 9" asked the old negro.&#xD;
&#xD;
SADIA..&#xD;
&#xD;
"I was thinking how it would be possible for&#xD;
me to take you and a few more of the faithful&#xD;
servants with me,,without danger of our being&#xD;
-pursued and you being taken from me. For.&#xD;
me they will never dare to take !"&#xD;
"IHow was you ngwine at first, Missy Sady ?"&#xD;
"In a boat down the river, to-night, with a&#xD;
trusty friend. But the boat will only carry&#xD;
four."&#xD;
"Dere's more'rwone boat on de ribber, Missy&#xD;
Sady, I s'pect. We got four belongin' to dis&#xD;
plantation, an' any one oh demt will carry a&#xD;
dozen ob us niggers. You just say 'you luff us&#xD;
go wid you, and I reckon when Mars'r Warburton&#xD;
wake up in de mornin' he'll find de horses an'&#xD;
de mules, but he mist dribe um heself! Ya,&#xD;
ya l Jes' say we may go, Missy Sady, and see&#xD;
if we isn't all ready, wid plenty to eat on de&#xD;
way t"&#xD;
w And will you fight if we are pursued ?"&#xD;
" Yes, if Missy Sady tell us to. She our&#xD;
captain, and we'll 'bey orders! But I reckon&#xD;
Mars'r might as well get along widout his tree&#xD;
or four double-barrell guns and de two rifles and&#xD;
dem pair of rewolvers dat be practice wid ebbery&#xD;
- day ! We may need 'em more dan he does !"&#xD;
" Yes-all the available arms must be taken.&#xD;
And now that I say you may go, hurry, Napo-&#xD;
leon, and get all the people that you can trust&#xD;
ready, and meet me with your boats in front of&#xD;
old Hunter's hut, on the river, in two hours&#xD;
No words or actions to betray o-1r intentions to&#xD;
the only two who will oppose them. I will try&#xD;
to see them set, and get them so lulled into se-&#xD;
curity that they will sleep late. Send Priscilla&#xD;
to my room right away. She must help me&#xD;
take care of Marion and Carline. Come your-&#xD;
self for the arms and ammunition in an hour.&#xD;
You will find them in the dark cupboard at the&#xD;
end of the front hall. I will have the door un-&#xD;
locked."&#xD;
"All right, Missy Cap'n Sady ; I 'stand de&#xD;
orders, an ' I 'boys 'em, see if I doesn't."&#xD;
And the old negro, following his new light,&#xD;
hurried away ; while Sadia, more hopeful from&#xD;
having additional strength with her, entered the&#xD;
house with a lighter heart than she had when&#xD;
she left it.&#xD;
Passing the room where she expected to hear&#xD;
sounds of convivild enjoyment from her brother&#xD;
and cousin, she paused to listen. But she heard&#xD;
nothing. Both had retired, to sleep away the&#xD;
effects of their potations. This she learned by&#xD;
meeting the servant, who had been directed to&#xD;
call them at four o'clock in the morning. She&#xD;
i      told him that he might go to sleep, she would&#xD;
herself awaken them. And the drowsy boy very&#xD;
k      willingly hurried away to his blanket in tht&#xD;
kitchen; for one of his race seldom refuses&#xD;
chance to sleep.&#xD;
Sadia no* hurried to her own room, and lay&#xD;
ing aside the hood and shawl which had beer&#xD;
t&amp;amp;hr protection against the heavy dews of th&#xD;
&#xD;
night, she entered the next apartment which&#xD;
opened from within hers, where on two beds&#xD;
rested those who only were dear to heron earth&#xD;
-her little sister and younger brother. She&#xD;
woke them both with kisses, and asked them if&#xD;
they would rather go away and live with her&#xD;
than be carried off by her brother.&#xD;
That brother they both feared, but did not .&#xD;
love ; for fear and love in a huuian-heart are in-&#xD;
compatible.  Therefore, their answer can be&#xD;
easily supposed. With tearful eyes and cling-&#xD;
ing arms, they begged to go wherever she went,&#xD;
and that they might never be separated from&#xD;
her. She told them to dress noiselessly, and&#xD;
began herself to gather such light and easily-&#xD;
carried articles as would make the journey&#xD;
comfortable as possible. All her money and&#xD;
jewelry she carefully secured upon her person ;&#xD;
and then, when her old nurse Priscilla came,&#xD;
she placed the children in'her charge, and went&#xD;
herself upon the most responsible and danger-&#xD;
ous duty of the night, that of securing arms&#xD;
and ammunition. For, to get these, she had to&#xD;
go into the room adjoining her brother's bed-&#xD;
room, and she knew not whether his slumbers&#xD;
would be heavy or Fght. But, at all risks, the&#xD;
arms must be had-to render her departure&#xD;
more safe, pursuit less rapid ; for no one would&#xD;
pursue an armed party, themselves unarned.&#xD;
With a hand nerved by the courage of her&#xD;
true womanly heart, she cautiously opened tho&#xD;
door of the room in which the cousins had&#xD;
spent the evening, and where the arms were&#xD;
kept. The light still burned upon the centre-&#xD;
table, and by it she saw, to her surprise, not&#xD;
unmixed with terror, her naval cousin, stretched&#xD;
at full length on the floor. A broken tumbler,&#xD;
an empty decanter, the stains on the carpet&#xD;
showing where most of its contents were gone,&#xD;
told what had brought him back after having&#xD;
bade his cousin good-night, and the reason of&#xD;
his downfall.&#xD;
At first she hesitated to enter, but the low&#xD;
snoring of the inebriate proclaimed his insensi-&#xD;
bility to hearing, for thunder was but little more&#xD;
than an echo to it.&#xD;
Glancing across the room, and observing that&#xD;
the door of her brother's bedroom was closed,&#xD;
she stealthirly entered, and going to that door,&#xD;
listened. here, too, she heard heavy breathing;&#xD;
and now, satisfied of safety, she hurriedly gath-&#xD;
ered the weapons and ammunition from differ-&#xD;
emt parts of the room and took them outside.&#xD;
Then the ludicrous and contemptible position&#xD;
of her cousin raised the spirit of mischief in&#xD;
. her bosom, and tearing a leaf from a note-book,&#xD;
she wrote upon it:&#xD;
e   "Sleep on. brave cavalier, with your chosen ride by&#xD;
a your side. Though weak in the spirit at present, she&#xD;
may be resuscitated by due attention, and aid -you in&#xD;
- rising once more to your feet. Hockhand soda-water&#xD;
are excellent for a morning headache; both can be&#xD;
n found in the cellar. But a cure for tlhe heartache may&#xD;
e not be found any easier than will be the one who pens&#xD;

these lines, and prefers to leave you'and her brother&#xD;
with your bottles than to go where only Rebels for a&#xD;

" SADIA DE MONTFOUtT."&#xD;
These lines she pinned upon Beverly's breast&#xD;
with a fearless hand ; then extinguishing the&#xD;
light, she noiselessly left the room.&#xD;
To take the arms below to the place designat-&#xD;
ed, occt1laied her but a few minutes, and she&#xD;
found Napoleon there already waiting for them.&#xD;
" Golly, Misv Cap'n Sady ! we is in luck ."&#xD;
he cried., "You'se got 'em all."&#xD;
Yes,' she replied. "The i-evolvers I shall&#xD;
carry niysclf, for I know how to use them.&#xD;
Thomas Hunter . must lave one of the best&#xD;
guns, for he is a brave old man, and will be our&#xD;
guide."&#xD;
Yes, Missy; he brave. He live dere all&#xD;
alone by heself, and not afraidd of de debbil.&#xD;

Some of 'em say dey hang him one dese days.&#xD;
If he go 'way rid us, dey'11 have to catch him&#xD;
afore dey h.tng him."&#xD;
"Well, never mind talking any more, Napo-&#xD;
leon ; it is time we were all moving. In half&#xD;
an hour, I shall be at the river side with the&#xD;
children and Priscilla. Every one not ready to&#xD;
embark when I get there will be left ; for we&#xD;
must be many miles from     here before day&#xD;
dawns !'&#xD;
Napoleon said no more, but carefully putting&#xD;
the ammunition-belts about his person, he gath-&#xD;
ered up the arms and left.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
The time Lad elapsed when Sadia was to re-&#xD;
turn to the but of the old fisherman. This he&#xD;
knew by reference to an old silver watch which&#xD;
he frequently looked at; and he began to show&#xD;
considerable nervousness, going frequently to&#xD;
his door to look out and listen. All at once he&#xD;
saw and heard something which more than ever&#xD;
startled him. IHe'closed his door as he stepped&#xD;
outside, that the fire-light might not glare out,&#xD;
and then bent low down that he might be sure,&#xD;
his eye-sight had not deceived him. For he&#xD;
thought he had seen dark figures moving be-&#xD;
tween him and the water which rolled in a&#xD;
smooth, unbroken tide beyond. He was not&#xD;
mistaken. Noiselessly they were moving down&#xD;
to the river-bank-who or what, he did not&#xD;
know, but he counted until he saw twenty per-&#xD;
sons standing between him and the shining wa-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
What could it mean. They had passed with-&#xD;
in a few yards of his but without noticing it, ap-&#xD;
parently--they had passed within ten feet of his&#xD;
up-turned boats without paying the least atten-&#xD;
tion tQ them.&#xD;
Something foul is going on, I'm afraid !" he&#xD;
murmured. "I fear the poor girl's plan has&#xD;
been discovered, and they want to catch her in&#xD;
&#xD;
the act of leaving. It must be so. I will at&#xD;
least meet her on the road, and warn ler of&#xD;
what I've seen."&#xD;
And the old man, acting upon the impulse of&#xD;
the thought, hurried off in the narrow path&#xD;
which led up to the mansion, making his steps&#xD;
as light as possible, while near his supposed en-&#xD;
em ies. After leaving the bank of the river, he&#xD;
increased his pace to a run, which was very&#xD;
suddenly interrupted as he turned a narrow&#xD;
corner around a brush-fence, by a collision.&#xD;
And that collision so sharp and sudden that&#xD;
both parties reeled back and fell to the earth-&#xD;
the clattering of weapons showing that one of&#xD;
the party was well armed.&#xD;
",e -devil-who's that ?" was Hunter's first&#xD;
exclamation as he picked himself up, and peer.&#xD;
ing forward in the darkness, tried to make out&#xD;
what it was that lay grunting and groaning be-&#xD;
fore him.&#xD;
"Oh, good Mars'r Debbil, if you is de-deb-&#xD;
bil, don't butt again dis chile no more!'' groaned&#xD;
the man in the path, whom the reader may rec-&#xD;
ognize easily as Napoleon, with his load of&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
"Only a nigger. What a fuss you make,&#xD;
darkey !" said the old fisherman, contemptuous.&#xD;
ly. "Who are you? Speak, or l'il let you&#xD;
feel the weight of my boot."&#xD;
The negro had ceased howling when hunter,&#xD;
spoke; and now recognizing his voice, in a&#xD;
much altered tone, he asked :&#xD;
" Isn't dat you, Mars'r Hunter. Cause if it&#xD;
is, I belongs to Missy Sady, an' she'll be along&#xD;
here right direckly, to tell you so!"&#xD;
The old man muttered something about a&#xD;
woman's folly in trusting a nigger-he evident-&#xD;
ly having a very poor opinion of the race.&#xD;
Then he replied to the question.&#xD;
"Yes-I am Tom hunter. What are you&#xD;
doing out this time of night ?"&#xD;
"Didn't you hear dese guns a rattlin' when&#xD;
you butt me ober like a sheep ? I was a fotch-&#xD;
in' ob de best gun on do plantation for you,&#xD;
sah-but dere's somefin' coming down de path&#xD;
behind dis chile. He'd better be up, so as to&#xD;
be ready for anodder butting' match. But I&#xD;
knows who dey is. My Silla's eves shine in de&#xD;
dark allIsame as a cat's!"   -&#xD;
'I knows dat are wuffless nigger's voice-&#xD;
dat's my old 'Nap' in tie road - Miss Sady !&#xD;
What you layin' dere for when we'se s'pcctin&#xD;
you down to de ribber!" said a sharp voice;&#xD;
and a negro woman, bearing a child w her arms,&#xD;
gave Napoleon a lift in the rear with her foot&#xD;
that started him to his feet in an instant.&#xD;
"What is the matter here ?'' now asked a&#xD;
voice clear as the note cf a silver bugle.&#xD;
"Nuffin, Miss Sad', on'y Mars'r Ilunter butt&#xD;
agin me in front, and now Silla butt agin me&#xD;
from behind. I is up, an' I got de arms an'&#xD;
ammernition all safe ! I neber drap not one ob&#xD;
dem, dough I drap myself uncommon hard !"&#xD;
&#xD;
said Napoleon, who ~gathered himself up in&#xD;
marching order.&#xD;
"And what brought you here, good friend&#xD;
Thomas ?" asked Sadia, who recognized Hunter&#xD;
in spite of the gloom.&#xD;
"Because, Miss Sadia, at the time when I ex-&#xD;
pected you, a lot of persons, whom I do not&#xD;
know, filed silently past my hut, and I left them&#xD;
standing on the bank of the river. I thought&#xD;
it was some trap to catch you, and I ran up&#xD;
here quickly to meet and warn you. In so do-&#xD;
ing, I run afoul of old Napoleon°here, whom I&#xD;
now know. The collision knocked most of the&#xD;
sense out of me, and about all out of him, to.&#xD;
judge from his talk. Now, have you any idea&#xD;
who those people are that evidently are on the&#xD;
watch for some one ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Thomas. They are my father's faithful&#xD;
slaves, who prefer to follow me, and share my&#xD;
fortunes, to going South with my cruel and un-&#xD;
natural brother.!"&#xD;
"All going?" asked f'unter, quietly.&#xD;
"All but one, and him I knew to be devoted&#xD;
to his master's interest. He sleeps like a log in&#xD;
the old kitchen 1"&#xD;
"Well, Miss, it is by your orders, and I'll&#xD;
not grumble against it. I only say, that so large&#xD;
a party cannot easily evade discovery. With one&#xD;
boat I could have got through undiscovered.&#xD;
But we have no time for parley. If your peo-&#xD;
ple have boats, let them follow the one in&#xD;
which I take you and your brother and sister.&#xD;
Of the arms, I want one gun-if we are pur-&#xD;
sued, and discovered, we must all fight. No&#xD;
cords now, but hurry to the river. We can be&#xD;
%ut four hours afloat before we must haul in and&#xD;
aide for the day ! If we are lively, we can reach&#xD;
I lagoon by that time, where we can, with care,&#xD;
Blind one day's safety from the keenest search !"&#xD;
"Lead the way-we will follow !" said Sadia,&#xD;
who led her little brother Marion by the hand,&#xD;
while Carline slept in the old nurse's strong&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
In' a short time, the river-bank was reached ;&#xD;
and Thomas 11unter,;assuming direction of mat-&#xD;
ters, soon saw that all hands were in the boats.&#xD;
When he saw the quality of the plantation-&#xD;
boats for capacity and speed, and the stalwart&#xD;
arms which were ready to tug at the oars, he&#xD;
altered his mind about taking one of his own&#xD;
boats; but taking the oars from both, and&#xD;
knocking a hole in the bottoms to render them&#xD;
useless, left them, and then took a seat in the&#xD;
fastest of the plantation-boats, in which he had&#xD;
already placed Miss Sadia and her charges.&#xD;
It was an hour later than the time he had&#xD;
named, when the boats, three in number, push-&#xD;
ed off, but they darted down the rapid river&#xD;
with a sped which satisfied him ; for he said,&#xD;
in a low tone, to Sadia, as they glided away&#xD;
from the shores of the dear old place:&#xD;
" I feel as if God was with us, lady, and that&#xD;
our plans and wishes will be carried out. Bc-&#xD;

&#xD;
fore daylight, we will reaeli the safest hiding-&#xD;
place on the Potomac. There we can spend the&#xD;
whole day in counting our numbers, examining&#xD;
our resources, and laying plans to guide our&#xD;
future movements, which must be made to morO&#xD;
at night only, until we reach Washington."&#xD;
"Very well, good friend. I resign the whole&#xD;
management to you," said Sadia.&#xD;
And, wearied out with excitement and exer-&#xD;
tion, she dropped her head upon the lap- of her&#xD;
old nurse, and slept.&#xD;
CUAPTEIR VI.&#xD;
While our voyagers are progressing with all&#xD;
the speed which hope and fear, and the current&#xD;
of a river too often crimsoned with human gore,&#xD;
can give them, we will mentally walk back to&#xD;
the almost deserted plantation, and see how&#xD;
affairs open there with the dawn of day-at&#xD;
the dawn of day, I said.&#xD;
When day dawned, so far as human kind was&#xD;
considered, all was as still as if none were liv-&#xD;
ing within the mansion. The roosters- had&#xD;
been crowing for hours, and the unmilked cows&#xD;
lowing in their lot, and the horses whinnying&#xD;
for grain in their stalls for a long time, when&#xD;
Warburton De Moutfort was aroused by the&#xD;
heat of the sun, over an hour high, shining in&#xD;
through the window upon his'feverish face.&#xD;
"This is four o'clock with a vengeance!" he&#xD;
cried, as he sprung from his bed, and dashed&#xD;
his head.into a basin of cold water. "I'll lick&#xD;
the life out of that stupid boy of mine! I sup-&#xD;
pose he went to the barn to look after the&#xD;
horses, and dropped asleep on the hay. We&#xD;
should have been across the ferrj, and moving&#xD;
over into the valley by this time."&#xD;
Hurriedly putting on his clothes, he entered&#xD;
the next room ; and there he saw the cousin&#xD;
whom he wished to force upon his brave, loyal,&#xD;
and lovely sister,:lying precisely as she had left&#xD;
him the night before.&#xD;
Glancing at the paper pinned upon the breast&#xD;
of Beverly, he stooped, read it, and at once&#xD;
recognized the handwriting.&#xD;
"Rather a severe eut upon a young gentle-&#xD;
man of decidedly convivial qualities," he said,&#xD;
sarcastically.&#xD;
Then shaking the sleeper roughly by his&#xD;
arm, he cried out loudly:&#xD;
"Wake up, Lieutenant! wake up! This is&#xD;
rather a harder bed than the one in your own&#xD;
room."&#xD;
'Is it four o'clock?-tirue to go?" muttered&#xD;
Beverly, partially aroused.&#xD;
"Not four yet, but it will be soon-after din-&#xD;
ner, man. What on earth are you doing here ?"&#xD;
"God only knows. I have' been walking in&#xD;
my sleep, I expect ; for I went to my room&#xD;
after leaving you last night. And here I am&#xD;
with a d'euced bad headache."&#xD;
"But a recipe for its cure is pinned to your&#xD;

breast, I see. You have had an earlier visitor&#xD;
than 1, it seems."&#xD;
" Thunder and Mars! I know I was tight&#xD;
last night, but I did not expect to be exposed&#xD;
to this,' iiiuttered Beverly, as he tore the paper&#xD;
from his coat, and looked at it. "But what&#xD;
does she mean about leaving, cousin?  Is there&#xD;
not some serious meanug in that ?"&#xD;
I reckon not " repled Warburton, quietly.&#xD;
" She has threatenedl leaving home more than&#xD;
once, and has never done it yet."&#xD;
"A woman's threats are not alwaysto be de-&#xD;
spised. I wonder what brought h,:r here to&#xD;
discover me in my condition ?"&#xD;
"She may have come for some cordial or&#xD;
liquor for a sick nigger. They always go to&#xD;
her for everything they  :nt. By-the-way, I&#xD;
should think a little peach and honey would do&#xD;
you good, cousin. I know a few spoonfuls wiM&#xD;
not hurt me. And then we'll meet the haughty&#xD;
lady at breakfast, and see if she is ready to be&#xD;
left alone or go with us, where glory waits us."&#xD;
"Ishall not object to the peach and honey,&#xD;
believing it more palatable if less poetic than&#xD;
hock and soda-water," said Beverly, approach-&#xD;
ing the sideboard. "But, Washburton, I'm&#xD;
afraid something has gone wrong, or we should&#xD;
not have been allowed to oversleep ourselves.&#xD;
Your directions to Napoleon to be ready for an&#xD;
early start were very explicit. And the lust&#xD;
words I heard you say were,' we are to be called&#xD;
at four o'clock '."&#xD;
"Yes, and my body-servant, Bob, was told,&#xD;
the last thing, to do so. I'll soon see where the&#xD;
ecrse is ! Brush yourself up and get ready for&#xD;
breakfast. By Jove, I wonder where my guns&#xD;
and revolvers have gone? I gave no orders to&#xD;
have them packed. Sadia must have been play-&#xD;
ing us some trick."&#xD;
And Warburton, who at this late moment&#xD;
discovered the loss of his arms, began to be a&#xD;
great deal more anxious than his cousin had&#xD;
seemed to be. He hurried out of the room,&#xD;
and'instantly repaired to the room usually oc-&#xD;
cupied by his sister. She was not there. He&#xD;
darted into the inner apartment, where little&#xD;
Canine and Marion always slept. They, too,&#xD;
were gone.&#xD;
"By heavens, she has carried them off!" he&#xD;
cried, in angry bitterness. "She has not slept&#xD;
in her bed ; but theirs have been occupied. I&#xD;
must see to this, for she cannot get them out of&#xD;
my reach !"&#xD;
And he rushed out to find some servant, of&#xD;
whom to make further inquiries. In hunting&#xD;
over the house, he at last stumbled on Bob, still&#xD;
snoring in his blanket, before the embers of the&#xD;
kitchen-fire.&#xD;
"Get up, you cursed scoundrel!t" he shout-&#xD;
ed, kicking him with his heavy boot. "Is this&#xD;
calling me at four o'clock? Get up before I&#xD;
kick the black heart out of you!"&#xD;
" Wha--wha's do matter, 1Mars'r Burton ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
exclaimed the terrified boy. rising to a sitting&#xD;
posture, and rubbing his great red eyes as if to&#xD;
open them wider.&#xD;
".Matter enough I  Where is Miss Sadia?&#xD;
Speak, you black imp, or I'll send one more&#xD;
nigger to the devil, and that in a hurry! Out&#xD;
with what you've got tssay !"&#xD;
" Miss Sady, I hasn't done seen her since last&#xD;
night. arter I carry up your wash-water, and&#xD;
you told me to sit up and call you at four&#xD;
o'clock. Dat I was agwine to do, but she said&#xD;
I needn't mind dat-she'd call you herself, and&#xD;
I might come down an' go to sleep ; and so I&#xD;
did, for I was berry tired. Dat's all I know,&#xD;
Mars'r Burton, 'fore God it is-au' I didn't mean&#xD;
nuflin wrong-you knows I didn't I"&#xD;
No; curse you! you don't know enough to&#xD;
mean to do wrong, but yet do a d-d sight of&#xD;
it. Go blow the horn for old Napoleon, and&#xD;
tell him to have every nigger on the place up&#xD;
in the room right away !"&#xD;
" Yes, Mars'r Burton ; I do 'em right off!"&#xD;
And the terrified boy, who had never seen his&#xD;
master so angry before, hurried off;  a d in a&#xD;
minute more the notes of the far-sounding&#xD;
plantation-horn rung out in the still morning&#xD;
air.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Warburton rejoinel his cousin,&#xD;
who, having finished a hurried morning-toilet,&#xD;
had returned to the room of the former.&#xD;
"It is as bad as you expected. Tne girl, and&#xD;
both of the children, are gone !" said Warbur-&#xD;
ton, as soon as he entered the room.&#xD;
"Gone? Where ?"&#xD;
"I have no idqa. I have sent for all the serv-&#xD;
ants to try and find out: I can find no house-&#xD;
servant about but Bob, and he says my sister met&#xD;
him, after he received my last orders, and told&#xD;
him to go to sleep-that she would call us."&#xD;
"By Jove, we'll have a chase to catch her, I&#xD;
fear. For she is as smart as women ever are&#xD;
made! If she has a start, and we don't get her&#xD;
track quickly, we'll find her words in that note&#xD;
coming true ! We should have kept watch and&#xD;
watch ourselves!"&#xD;
"I wish we had. But there is no use in cry-&#xD;
ing for that which is done. To undo it is our&#xD;
first work. Well, Bob, what news-are the hands&#xD;
coming in?"&#xD;
"De hands, Mars'r Burton?  I tinic de debbil&#xD;
done bin about last night. I blowed de horn,&#xD;
and blowed it, and I didn't sec nobody a stir-&#xD;
riu'! So I jess run down to de quarters fast as&#xD;
ebber I could, an' look in all de cabbins, and&#xD;
dere wasn't a single nigger dar. Dey'r all&#xD;
clean gone, M'ars'r Burton !"&#xD;
"The horses, mules, wagons, too, I s'ippose!''&#xD;
cried Warburton, as he ground his teeth in&#xD;
anger.&#xD;
"No, M:rs'r ; demv's all hers; I see derm&#xD;
about. But de smoke-house door stan' open.&#xD;

"Yes, Mars'r; I hear 'em    whinny in de&#xD;

"Then saddle two of them in a hurry. Bev-&#xD;
; erly, we'l try and find a cold bite to breakfast&#xD;
on, fill our flasks, and by that time the horses&#xD;
will be ready. Then we'll see what has become&#xD;
of this fast woman; for I believe she has enticed&#xD;
off every hand but Bob on the place. They&#xD;
may have gone to some near point, to claim&#xD;
protection; they would not have started men,&#xD;
women, children, and all, for a long journey&#xD;
;without wagons and animals to draw them!"&#xD;
"Have you no boats?     Can't niggers find&#xD;
transportation by water as well as by land ?"&#xD;
asked Beverly, quietly.&#xD;
"l3 Jove! I'll bet a hundred you've hit it.&#xD;
We have boats for taking wood and produce to&#xD;
market, and for the hands to fish in. I'll bet&#xD;
that mad girl has made a start for Washington,&#xD;
to put herself and the niggers under the pro-&#xD;
tection of the cursed Federals! -But she can&#xD;
never get there. The river is too well picketed&#xD;
by our folks ; and if I find she has taken that&#xD;
track, she can have but a short start, and we'll&#xD;
soon overtake her !"&#xD;
"I may be of tsome help to you in the trip ;&#xD;
but I cannot be long absent, for I have to re-&#xD;
port fir duty very shortly 1"&#xD;
"Oh! well have her back in a day or two-&#xD;
never fear ; and now that she has taken such a&#xD;
bold hand, I'll exercise my full scope of power&#xD;
over her! She shall go where I list, and do&#xD;
what I wish, or she shall envy the fate of the&#xD;
poorest wench that ever worked in a rice-field.&#xD;
But Ill go look for a cold-cut, which we'll&#xD;
wash down with something as good as coffee,&#xD;
and"then we'll see if we can strike the trace of&#xD;
these early skedaddlers !"&#xD;
CH APTER YI.&#xD;
Wlen   Sadia  De Montfort awoke on the&#xD;
morning of her departure, she was astonished to&#xD;
find ble boats no longer moving down the&#xD;
broad and clear river, which she knew and&#xD;
loved so well, but brought to, motionless, in a&#xD;
brook just wide enough to admit their passage.&#xD;
The water was clear and sparkling where the&#xD;
boats had been drawn in under some overhang-&#xD;
ing branches, but a little ways below they&#xD;
seemed to deaden into a darker, deeper pool, as&#xD;
if they had already found their vent in the&#xD;
back-water of some large stream; and such was&#xD;
the case. The jar of the boats striking the&#xD;
shore caused Sadia to awake, and she instantly&#xD;
asked the old fisherman where they were.&#xD;
"Full forty miles below your own sweet&#xD;
" Spriugland", lady and in a spot so far back&#xD;
t from the river, and so surrounded by swamps&#xD;
in front, aLd mountains in our rear, that I think&#xD;
we can pass a day, or even more, here, if it be&#xD;
Necessary, wiLhout any one suspecting our&#xD;
Y" location. I came here and built a hut three&#xD;
years ago, and though I fished and hunted all&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
about for nearly two months, I did not Bee Ca&#xD;
human soul. If I had gone out upon the river,&#xD;
I could have seen plenty of them-but I did not&#xD;
choose to. Now, if you please, as we must paseo&#xD;
the day here, we will all go up and see if my old&#xD;
home is safe. It is but five minutes' walk from&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"I am ready ; com    Marion and Carline ;&#xD;
we will see what hind of a home we can find in&#xD;
the wtlwood."&#xD;
"And you, boys, bring along something for&#xD;
breakfast. You can build a fire in here with-&#xD;
out danger," added Hunter, as he, with a cour-&#xD;
teous bow, extended his hand to assist Sadia to&#xD;
the shore.&#xD;
The old path from the landing was still plain,&#xD;
though somewhat obstructed by brambles; but&#xD;
these were brushed aside by the yet vigorous&#xD;
old man, as he limped along ahead of Sadia,&#xD;
carrying the double-barreled shot-gun in his&#xD;
hand, which Sadia had given him. It seemed to&#xD;
Sadia scarce two minutes from the time when&#xD;
she left the boat, before they emerged from the&#xD;
thick underbrush  and   overhanging forest-&#xD;
branches into a small circular prairie of per-&#xD;
haps two acres. On the left of this rose a per-&#xD;
pendicular wall of rock, the base evidently of&#xD;
some great mountain ; and under this cliff,&#xD;
close by ,where a spring rushed out in a minia-&#xD;
ture torrent from the dark rocks, was the but&#xD;
of which Hunter had spoken.&#xD;
It was larger and better built than the one&#xD;
which he had left at Springland ; and he told&#xD;
Sadia, that when he built it he had entertained&#xD;
thoughts of making it his final home, because&#xD;
of the utter seclusion of the spot and the plenti-&#xD;
tude of fish and game in the vicinity.&#xD;
While he was yet speaking, a herd of a dozen&#xD;
or more of red deer emerged from the under-&#xD;
brush within a few rods of them, and walking&#xD;
out to feed on the little prairie, saw the party,&#xD;
but did not fly, as those timid animals always do&#xD;
in places where they are hunted.&#xD;
"I want no better proof that no'one has yet&#xD;
discovered my secret," said old Hunter quietly,&#xD;
as he drew up his gun, and with the unerring aim&#xD;
of an old marksman, discharged both barrels, one&#xD;
so quickly after the other that both reports&#xD;
mingled as one.&#xD;
Two of the deer lay struggling in the death-&#xD;
throes in an instant, the rest slowly trotted back&#xD;
into the woods, turning their heads now and&#xD;
then, more in wonder than in terror.&#xD;
"Now, boys, there is fresh meat for two days&#xD;
at least, eat as hearty as ye may, Go and dress&#xD;
it, and we'll soou have some of it doing for&#xD;
breakfast," said the old man, as he. quietly re-&#xD;
loaded his gun with buckshot as it had been be-&#xD;
fore. "I have a nice fire-place over there in&#xD;
the house ; and if the roof hasn't leaked, there is&#xD;
plenty of dry wood inside. Let us go and see,&#xD;
Miss Sadia!r"&#xD;

&#xD;
SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
drawn from the wild beauty ofthe scenery to the&#xD;
act of the hunter, had, ever since he fired, been&#xD;
looking tearfully on the struggles, now over, of&#xD;
the animals who had gazed so innocently at the&#xD;
very hand raised for their death.&#xD;
OIL, they were too beautiful to be killed&#xD;
She said, with a sigh. "I could have watched&#xD;
them for hours, with never a thought of harm in&#xD;
my bosom."&#xD;
' "Unless you grew hungry, Miss Salia, and&#xD;
remembered the savory    haunches of veni-&#xD;
seen, that so often smoked on your father's&#xD;
board. I have sold him more than one inn my&#xD;
time, and he was a noble hunter himself!"&#xD;
Sadia smiled, in spite of her pity for the poor&#xD;
deer.&#xD;
"You were right in shooting them, good&#xD;
Thomas !" said she. " But it was, nevertheless,&#xD;
hard to see them die. We, doubtless, shall need&#xD;
all the provision we can get on the wa y; for our&#xD;
colored people are not used to starvation, or&#xD;
anything even approaching to famine."&#xD;
By this time the but was reached. Thomas&#xD;
opened the door, which was latched inside, by&#xD;
inserting his knife between the doorpost and&#xD;
door, then lifting the latch, for the " lateh-string&#xD;
did not hang out", to make entrance easy on&#xD;
that occasion.                         -&#xD;
The large room was dry and clean. A huge&#xD;
pile of dry fire-wood near the fire-place made&#xD;
good the promise of Thomas, that cooking op-&#xD;
crations could soon be got under way.&#xD;
"Please notice one thing, Miss Sadia," said&#xD;
the old man, who had hurriedly kindled a blaze.&#xD;
"Step out and see how yo. like t';e draft of my&#xD;
chimney. Of course, you can judge by the&#xD;
smoke."&#xD;
Sadia stepped out, an I though a dense smoke,&#xD;
had been ascending;in the fire-piace, she could&#xD;
see no sign of it rising from the roof of the&#xD;
hut.&#xD;
She returned and reported as much.&#xD;
Look once more, lady-far up the mountain-&#xD;
side where the bushes are very thick, and, pos-&#xD;
sibly, you .may see a bluish mist, looking far&#xD;
more like the light fog of a mountain-spring&#xD;
than anything else," said the old man.&#xD;
Sadia went out, and soon saw the mist alluded&#xD;
to, which she or few others would have ever&#xD;
supposed to-be smoJke.&#xD;
"My chimney is a cave, that winds its flues up&#xD;
through t ,e rocks a long way-but it has a good-&#xD;
draught, and that is all that is required fr a&#xD;
nice tire."&#xD;
And the bright blaze, leaping from fagot toJ&#xD;
fagot of the freshly-heaped wood, verified his&#xD;
words.-&#xD;
And tihe negro women, gathering in with their&#xD;
cooking-apparatus and provisions, soon had1&#xD;
cort.cake baking, bacon .and , venison frying,I&#xD;
coffee and water boling, and sweet potatoes&#xD;
roasting in the embers.&#xD;
" Yoa will have but a sorry meal, compared&#xD;
&#xD;
with the iluxries left at Spi inland, lady ; but {&#xD;
it is 1 he bcstZ we can do," said old Thomas, as hei&#xD;
s:iw l'uesiilla laying out before her lady onhiss.&#xD;
slab table, Some of the choicest pieces of&#xD;
1.i~e  venison ,&#xD;
n:.c^ hloa-cake, with butter brought from thea&#xD;
ni Imtation, roasted potatoes, and fragrant cof-l&#xD;
The breakfast is better, and will be eaten&#xD;
with a better appetite than any that I could&#xD;
have taken at Springland in the coiriny o4 ;&#xD;
my persecutors," she replied. " Come, goode.&#xD;
Thoias, you who are our f ilher,"-guide, and pro.N ,&#xD;
vider, must take the heal of the table, or I and&#xD;
the children sill surely have no appetite.''&#xD;
The old fisherman tried to excuse himselff"&#xD;
but without avail. Sadia would only eat if hed.&#xD;
joined in the repast.&#xD;
The meal was heartily pafrtaken of. The wild.H&#xD;
ness of the scene, the perl of tie adventure, the&#xD;
rudeness of the preparations, seemed to height-H&#xD;
en rather than to mar the appetites of the whole&#xD;
party. For the negroes, as soo as the table'&#xD;
had been served, gathered in grotesque groups&#xD;
about the hut, and, with their breakfasts in their&#xD;
hands, ate and chatted as merrily as if they had&#xD;
not lost sight of their old plantation-home, per-&#xD;
maps forever.&#xD;
After the morning meal was over, Thomas .&#xD;
hunter told Sadia that it would be necessary for&#xD;
him to go in a boat with a couple of men, to a&#xD;
point where he could see what passed upon the&#xD;
river, Lo discover if they were pursued, or ir&#xD;
picket-boats were on the move.Y&#xD;
Ie advised her to rest, for no danger could&#xD;
approach, except fronrthe point where he would&#xD;
be on the watch. That he would return by&#xD;
night, or earlier if advisable, and then their&#xD;
journey would be resumed, if it could be done&#xD;
with safety. To some of the men he gave fish.&#xD;
ing lines, and showed them where fine fish could.&#xD;
be caught, to add to their dinner bill of fare,;&#xD;
and then he hurried off with N'apoleon and&#xD;
another picked band, to see how matters looked,&#xD;
river-ward.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
The cold breakfast which Warburton DeH&#xD;
Montfort had to provide for himself and cousin,&#xD;
could not have been very inviting, or else anx-&#xD;
iety overbalanced appemie; for Bob was not ten)H&#xD;
minutes in having the saddled horses at the door=&#xD;
-his master's rude awakening had started him0&#xD;
on a lively gait, and he kept it up. But they&#xD;
gentlemen were ready and at the door before the&#xD;
horses were.&#xD;
"Stay here and look out for things till I getm&#xD;
back," cried his master, as lie sprung into the&#xD;
saddle. "Now, Beverly," he added, "we will&#xD;
first gallop down to our boat-landing, and see ii&#xD;
the boats are dra u up in the boat-house, as they}.&#xD;
should be, if all is right in that direction."&#xD;
Beverly bowed his assent, and followed the #&#xD;
lead of the others, who, taking a lane well-:.&#xD;
4 t&#xD;
it&#xD;
&#xD;
SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
marked by cattle and cart tracks, dashed off to&#xD;
a point on the river, nearly a quarter of a mile&#xD;
above the but of the old fisherman. Here a dock&#xD;
jutted out into the river, and at its lower tide&#xD;
was quite a capacious boat-house, with a floating&#xD;
platform capable of holding a dozen or more&#xD;
ordinary skiffs. But there was no boat to be&#xD;
seen there now.&#xD;
"You were right, Beverly, you were right--&#xD;
the boats are gone, and of course we know who&#xD;
took them! The next thing is, to gather three&#xD;
or four trusty men, and pursue them!"&#xD;
"Where are the boats to do it in?" asked&#xD;
Beverly' dryly.&#xD;
"There are plenty besides ours on the river.&#xD;
An old curse called~Tonm hunter, who lives by&#xD;
hunting and fishing, a quarter of a mile down,&#xD;
always has two or three in order, good boats of&#xD;
his own build. I heard that the rascal has&#xD;
Union proclivities, and I ordered him off the&#xD;
place a few days ago, for he has been one of&#xD;
father's 'charity tenants', as I call them, for&#xD;
years. If he hasn't left, we will take his boats.&#xD;
And we may hear something from him about&#xD;
the fugitives-for ie's always about."&#xD;
"Then let's ride down there. Every minute&#xD;
we lose is a gain to them !" cried Beverly.&#xD;
Warburton remounted and rode rapidly down&#xD;
the river, followed by his cousin. Before they&#xD;
had ridden half way, a long and melancholy&#xD;
howl, like that of some lost dog, reached their&#xD;
cars. And it seemed to be echoed or answered&#xD;
by a good many more. A gallop of three min-&#xD;
utes more exhibited the source of this "mad&#xD;
music", for if a dog's howling is not enough to&#xD;
drive one mad, I'd like to know what would.&#xD;
All the dogs on the plantation, hounds, coon.&#xD;
dogs, and curs, scenfed to have gathered there&#xD;
to lament the departure of those who had fed&#xD;
them and hunted with them. For every negro&#xD;
who has a Sunday, and loves coons and pos-&#xD;
sums, has his dog, and would share his last hoe-&#xD;
cake with him, if meat was scarce.&#xD;
"Here, right in front of the old curse's cabin&#xD;
is where the party embarked. They woulctnot&#xD;
take the dogs in the boats for fear of discovery,&#xD;
and here the beasts have remained" exclaimed&#xD;
Warburton.&#xD;
And then he rode up Qnd saw the well-defined&#xD;
tracks of the main party who had come down&#xD;
in the narrow by-path, while only three or four&#xD;
went to bring the boats down.&#xD;
"Old Hunter's boats lie up there yet-we'll&#xD;
see what he says about this exodus!" he added,&#xD;
as he rode furiously up to the door of the old&#xD;
hut, which stood invitingly open.&#xD;
"Not a soul here! The fire yet smoking,&#xD;
but everything else gone. The old curse is&#xD;
their adviser and guide, I'll bet a thousand !"&#xD;
"Yes, and he has left you a nice pair of boats&#xD;
to follow him in !" said Beverly, who had ex-&#xD;
amined the boats as he rode up.  "Their bot-&#xD;
toms are stove in, and they Are useless."&#xD;
&#xD;
21&#xD;
&#xD;
"The infernal villain ! I wish I had shot him&#xD;
when he told me, had my father lived, he would&#xD;
have been true to the old flag."&#xD;
"Blast the flags ! Let us talk work, for now&#xD;
we have something to work upon. Here is a&#xD;
white man aiding and abetting, yes, leading the&#xD;
escape of your slaves-your property.  He&#xD;
must be followed, captured and punished. You&#xD;
have a Vigilance Committee of fifty men right&#xD;
in your neighborhood-get enough of them to&#xD;
accompany us, and ve'1l have the party yet in&#xD;
twenty-four hours, if they are not already in&#xD;
the hands'of some of the river-pickets."&#xD;
"Good. I will act upon that. But they hayo&#xD;
at least eight or ten good guns, plenty of ammu,&#xD;
nition, for all mine is gone, and two revolvers,&#xD;
every weapon I had in the house !"&#xD;
"I had nothing but my sword, and that was&#xD;
hanging in my room when I left there. I.hung&#xD;
it when I first went there. Let us ride back to&#xD;
the house, refresh, then organize at least three&#xD;
boats' crews, well armed, and follow them !"&#xD;
"Follow? The devil will be to know where&#xD;
they have gone !" -said Warburton, moodily, as&#xD;
he turned his horse's head toward the house.&#xD;
"They have no refuge but in Washington, I&#xD;
tell you: no route but the river they can follow.&#xD;
All we need is, force and speed to overtake&#xD;
them before they get there. If not, farewell&#xD;
your hopes for your niggers-my hopes for&#xD;
your sister's hand. She has shown so much&#xD;
wit and spirit in this adventure, that I love her&#xD;
more madly than before, and would 'nut lose&#xD;
her for an admiral's commission in our new&#xD;
Navy. Ride up, man-ride up ! I am in a&#xD;
hurry to be afloat and after them!1"&#xD;
Warburton spurred on rapidly, and rode up&#xD;
to the door, where Bob, once more asleep,&#xD;
nodded on the horse-block.&#xD;
"You cursed nigger, if you are the last I've&#xD;
got,I'll kill you !" he shouted, and raised the&#xD;
butt of a loaded riding-whip to strike the poor&#xD;
fellow.&#xD;
"Hold on, Coz-our horses haven't been fed&#xD;
yet this morning-don't kill Bob till henbas&#xD;
done that. Use the other end of your whip&#xD;
this time 1" cried Beverly, catching his arm.&#xD;
Warburton almost cursed his cousin for his&#xD;
interference ; but the end of the whip was&#xD;
changed, and a cut across the check, which&#xD;
first left a white streak, then deeply reddening&#xD;
with the gushing blood, woke the poor devil to&#xD;
a sense of the fact that his master had "one&#xD;
nigger left".&#xD;
"Wake up, you cursed Caliban, and .rub&#xD;
down and feed these horses when they are cool.&#xD;
Now, go and saddle my fox-hunter and the race-&#xD;
mare. Have them here in ten minutes, or you're&#xD;
as dead as the lead in tie butt of this whip !"&#xD;
he cried, as poor Bob sprung to his feet with a&#xD;
howl rather than a yell of agony.&#xD;
"Better yet," said Beverly. "I didn't think&#xD;
about they're having left you all your stock.&#xD;
&#xD;

Yr.&#xD;
Cr&#xD;
&#xD;
We will be reaay for the road in ten minutes.&#xD;
I'll buckle on my sword, now; it may be of use&#xD;
before we're through."&#xD;
And Beverly hurried up to the room which&#xD;
he hal occupied as a guest, and in a moment&#xD;
rejoined Warburton, who was on his way to the&#xD;
refreshment-room with it in his hand.&#xD;
"I used to wear it in the Old Service, but it&#xD;
will do as well in the new," he said, as he saw&#xD;
Warburton's eye glance upon the scabbard&#xD;
decorations. "It is a Solinegn blade, mount-&#xD;
ed to the U. S. pattern by old Ames, of Spring-&#xD;
field, the father of good war cutlery in this&#xD;
country. The blade will double. I will show&#xD;
you."&#xD;
And as he advanced into the well-remember-&#xD;
ed room where Sadia had pinned her last com-&#xD;
pliment upon his breast, he drew; a curse came&#xD;
with it, for only half the blade was attached to&#xD;
the hilt of the sword.&#xD;
"Who in the name of the foul fiend has&#xD;
broken my sword ?" he cried, as he turned the&#xD;
sheath upside down.&#xD;
The other part of the blade dropped upon the&#xD;
floor as he did so, and with it, a paper, which he&#xD;
picked up and read.&#xD;
"May God curse me if I ever forgive her for&#xD;
this !" he cried, as, with a face utterly white&#xD;
with rage, he cast the paper upon the floor and&#xD;
stamped upon it.&#xD;
Warburton stooped and picked it up;.for he&#xD;
saw the handwriting of his sister. And he&#xD;
smiled bitterly as he read her woras;&#xD;
"The sword once worn in an honorable service is un-&#xD;
fit for the hand of a Rebel in a false cause. A loyal&#xD;
woman has taken her only means of preventing such use&#xD;
being made of it. When Randolph Beverly will send&#xD;
me the bill of cost for the weapon, the writer will repay&#xD;
ii with pleasure.        SADIA D MOYTFGBT."&#xD;
"Rather hard upon you-rather hard, Ber-&#xD;
erly. If you had slept in your own room last&#xD;
night, she would hardly have ventured upon&#xD;
this last trick. But name the price of the wea-&#xD;
ron, cousin ; for the honor of the family, I'll&#xD;
pay it."                                    i&#xD;
"I'il tell her the price when I see her once&#xD;
more. Until then, let the debt ,stand," said&#xD;
Beverly, bitterly, casting -the sword, scabbard&#xD;
and all, from him-.&#xD;
"Don't take it too hard, my boy. Take a n&#xD;
drink or two, and we'll be off; for I am not fond t&#xD;
'of ,river-navigation, and the shorter our trip is,&#xD;
the better it will please me."&#xD;
"Well, as you say, so. be it, Warburton. I s&#xD;
eare nothing for the loss of the sword ; it is:&#xD;
only the cool and contemptuous way she did it. r&#xD;
I hardly know how a woman's weak arm could e&#xD;
have snapped so good a blade. But Jet the s&#xD;
matter pass for the present. I'll put the frag- e&#xD;
ment back in the scabbard, and stow it away a&#xD;
among your old closet-lumber. I'll soon wear&#xD;
as good a one."o&#xD;
"Certainly, for I'll purchase it myself-the t&#xD;
best there is in Richmond, when wo get there.. w&#xD;
&#xD;
I hear the horses at the door. Here is a well.K&#xD;
filled hunting4lask for each pf us. Pocket and,&#xD;
off!"&#xD;
In a few moments, poor Bob was master pre&#xD;
tem. of the mansion of Springland.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
To say that Sadia was not anxious during the&#xD;
absence of her faithful friend and guide, Thom&#xD;
as Hunter, would be to utter an untruth. Butt&#xD;
all credit to the woman's heart within her,&#xD;
which had yet known no love but that felt fors&#xD;
her kindred, her anxiety was for the safety of the r&#xD;
brave man who was perling his life in her cause.&#xD;
She wandered all about the'fairy spot chosen for&#xD;
their retreat, and she could find no sign of liv-&#xD;
ing men ever having been there, except such as.&#xD;
Ihunter had told her were made by himself.&#xD;
'When the sun as well as her watch, proclaim..&#xD;
ed the high hour of noon, she sat down with&#xD;
Marion and Carline to a delicious dinner pre-&#xD;
pared by the hands of her faithful old nurse.&#xD;
There was soup made from terrapins caught&#xD;
,near the stream ; delicious fish from its waters ;&#xD;
venison cooked in various ways ; and, of course,&#xD;
the inevitable cornbread and bacon, without.&#xD;
which no Southern meal in the olden time was&#xD;
complete. More to please her faithful servants&#xD;
than to gratify her own appetite, Sadia tasted&#xD;
of every dish, and saw her little charges enjoy&#xD;
themselves hugely, as well as'the servants, in the&#xD;
bountiful repast given them by Nature.&#xD;
After dinner was over, expecting to travel all&#xD;
night, she lay down upon a bed of fragrant&#xD;
herbs, gathered by her women, and sought a&#xD;
little rest, dii'ecting that she should be called&#xD;
the moment the good old guide reti.rned.&#xD;
She awoke before she was called, and the sun&#xD;
was then low in the western sky, but hunter&#xD;
had not come or sent her any message. As the&#xD;
sun sunk lower and lower, so her heart went&#xD;
down toward the dark horizon of sadness' What&#xD;
f Thomas, whose faith she did not doubt, had&#xD;
been captured or slain ! Who, then, would be&#xD;
equal to the task of guiding her past the dangersH&#xD;
which she knew were before hcr? Ier ne rocsH&#xD;
would obey her orders, but they neither could k&#xD;
nor would think for her. They knew nothing of&#xD;
he river.s&#xD;
The sun at last went down, and yet no arrival '&#xD;
-no signal-no message. Fearing for ihe worst, ;.&#xD;
he placed her armed men at a point which corn.&#xD;
handed the channel through which they had H&#xD;
reachedd the spot, and stationing herself, revolve '&#xD;
r in hand, in advance, determined that no one&#xD;
hould reach their position, except it was Hunt- &#xD;
r amd his men, without -finding a sharp resist-&#xD;
.nce.                                       -&#xD;
The twilight deepened into darkness. The&#xD;
wls hooted through the forest, and now and&#xD;
hen some sharp, shrill cry vonld tach her ear,&#xD;
which would send a chill to her heart. Whether&#xD;
&#xD;
it came from bird or beast she knew not ; forh&#xD;
she was not versed in woodcraft. h&#xD;
Her people, seeing her so anxious, forgot the sh&#xD;
natural apathy of their race, and huddled around lo&#xD;
her, as if she alone could protect them. For a&#xD;
ittle time it was thus ; the darkness deepening, al&#xD;
end the silent, terror-stricken people huddling se&#xD;
lose up to her. Then itbegan to grow lighter; e&#xD;
the power of the moon, already up, but hidden&#xD;
in a bank of clouds which had partially over- ti&#xD;
spread the sky, exhibited itself, and threw out, f&#xD;
in bold relief, the great forest-trees, with their b&#xD;
wide-spread arms, the glittering water, and the ri&#xD;
grouping around the poor orphan-girl.      ti&#xD;
" Hark ! I hear the dash of oars, sister," said t&#xD;
Marion, who held and had insisted upon keeping t&#xD;
the other revolver in his hand. For his brother&#xD;
had let him fire it a few times, and he thought y&#xD;
he could fight, if he was little. Or so,at least t&#xD;
he said.&#xD;
Sadia, listened, and sadly said: &#xD;
"It is only the dash of the stream among the e&#xD;
rocks above, Marion."                      n&#xD;
"No, sissy, no ,'listen now-it comes nearer o&#xD;
and nearer ; and there-what's that?"4&#xD;
A sharp and prolonged whistle sounding from I&#xD;
but a short distance below, reached the ears of&#xD;
every one there. 1&#xD;
"Hush ! no answer !" said Sadia, in a loud t&#xD;
whisper. "It may come from enemies."&#xD;
All was silent a moment, then she distinctly&#xD;
heard the dash of oars again. And a moment&#xD;
later she could see the head of a boat just emerg- t&#xD;
ing froi the dark eddy which I have spoken&#xD;
of once before.&#xD;
"Who comes there? Stop and answer, or&#xD;
twenty loaded guns will open on you!" cried]&#xD;
Sadia, in..a voice which did not tremble.&#xD;
"Hardly twenty, Miss Sadia, but enough in&#xD;
good hands to give a big crowd a heap of trou-&#xD;
ble," said a voice which she recognized instantly&#xD;
as that of old Thomas. "I'm sorry I haven't anyI&#xD;
countersign to give you, but if you'll agree not.to&#xD;
fire those twenty guns,I'll come in and report."+&#xD;
"0 good Thomas, come quickly ! You stay-+&#xD;
ed so long that I thought you was lost, and I&#xD;
began to expect my persecutors rather than you,"&#xD;
cried Sadia.&#xD;
"So I see by my reception. If I had known&#xD;
I would be kept so long, I should have arranged&#xD;
a signal by which you might have known me.&#xD;
As it was, I whistled, for fear you might have&#xD;
them twenty guns pointed at me."&#xD;
"Oh, do not, good Thomas, laugh at me any&#xD;
more.   Was it not wise to represent myself&#xD;
stronger than I was ?"&#xD;
"Customary in war, if not wise ; but many a&#xD;
battle is lost by it, kind lady. But now that I&#xD;
am with you, if you'll start these darkeys off to&#xD;
cooking something to eat,-I'll be obliged. For.&#xD;
I have something to tell you."&#xD;
"People, you've forgotten all about supper,"&#xD;
said Sadia. " Now let us have it at once."&#xD;
&#xD;
And as the negroea started off joyfully to obey&#xD;
er orders, thinking the crisis of danger all over,&#xD;
ie walked slowly on with Thomas Hunter, fol-&#xD;
wed by Marion and Canine.&#xD;
"Now, good Thomas," she said, "I will hear&#xD;
1l, that you have to say. Tell me without re-&#xD;
erve our hopes and our dangers. The one may&#xD;
heer, the other shall not appall me."&#xD;
"Well, Miss, we are followed. I was in hopes&#xD;
hey would either come quicker, or else not be.&#xD;
ore night. It was almost sundown when three&#xD;
oats, with five men in each, came down the&#xD;
river. One boat followed close along each bank ;&#xD;
he other took the centre of the stream,' and&#xD;
hey had signals' by which any one could inform&#xD;
he other of news.&#xD;
"The man who steered one of these boats waar&#xD;
your brother; the one who steered the second&#xD;
hat Navy cousin of yours, and the third old Carl&#xD;
Michel, as he called himself; that old French&#xD;
pirate that has been such a terror to weak-head-&#xD;
ed negroes, and so useful to the Vigilance Com-&#xD;
mittee of late in carrying out their devilish plots&#xD;
of vengeance.&#xD;
"I recognized all three and most of the crew&#xD;
before they were within half a mile of mc. =So&#xD;
did old Napoleon, and his hair-wool, I s'pose I'd&#xD;
better call it,is full white now ; it was only gray&#xD;
this morning."&#xD;
"0 Mr. Hunter, do not joke, but tell me&#xD;
all!"&#xD;
"I'm not joking, kind lady. Napoleon and&#xD;
the other boy were almost scared out of their&#xD;
wits; for one boat was not four hund red yards&#xD;
back from where we were hidden, and we were&#xD;
within twenty feet of the shore, in a clump of&#xD;
laurels right over the beach.&#xD;
"I just told the cowardly curses to crawl back&#xD;
fifty feet! and lay with their faces to the ground,&#xD;
and if they raised their heads till I went and&#xD;
bade them do it, I told them I'd blow them from.&#xD;
their bodies.of&#xD;
"They were glad enough to get out of sight&#xD;
of what was coming down the river, and they&#xD;
crawled back as I told themA to. And it was&#xD;
well for us all they did-for they'd have never&#xD;
kept still under what next happened.&#xD;
"Right under where I lay, at the foot of the&#xD;
bluff, not forty feet from me, a beautiful spring&#xD;
gushed out from the rocks, and dashed into the&#xD;
river with considerable velocity. It appears&#xD;
old.Michel, who k.ows a good deal about the&#xD;
river, had been to this spring before; for h&#xD;
hauled in toward it from the centre of the rive&#xD;
when about a quarter of a mile above, and sig-&#xD;
naled to the boat on the other side to come&#xD;
over.     o&#xD;
The first boat which reached the spot was his&#xD;
own, and it was lucky for us; for Warburton,&#xD;
your brother, passed without seeing the entranc9'&#xD;
by which we found the swamp and bayou that&#xD;
is our only path to this place.&#xD;

SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
was filling a cup a' the spring when your brother&#xD;
'Warburton landed.&#xD;
'Nothing ; not a track, or a place where a&#xD;
boat has touched the shore~so far and no streams&#xD;
large enough for them to go up !' replied your&#xD;
brother' ' Why do you stop here ?'&#xD;
'One time because it is one bon spring-&#xD;
wataire all same like ice. Two time because it&#xD;
shail soon be night, and we must deliberat what&#xD;
we sail do when we cannot see ze shore, nor&#xD;

"'Yes-yes-go on!'&#xD;
"' Well zey leave; some time not more zan&#xD;

"'Z;it is whatI will say now zat Messieurflev-&#xD;
erlce 'ave come! Zey cannot be on far ahead&#xD;

you understand ?'&#xD;
"'Yes; which boat should go before'?' said&#xD;
Warburton.&#xD;
"'Not mine ; for I do not know the river !'&#xD;
said Beverly.&#xD;
" ' Ze rivare know itsel f,Messieur Beverlee, and&#xD;
ze boat- know ze rivare. You put him in ze&#xD;

cake un wiz ze sun sixty, Eeventy, miles from&#xD;

go. Only I wish zat you both will look to ze&#xD;

again to-morrow before ze set o. ze sun, for I&#xD;
&#xD;
will not go so far as not to meet wiz you if you&#xD;
como ?'&#xD;
"'Then it is understood-l4et us be off to our&#xD;
stations!' said Warburton.&#xD;
"And, lady, in three minutes more they&#xD;
shoved off and were soon out of hearing, but&#xD;
not out of sight; for the two boats are anchored&#xD;
where the river is not three hundred yards&#xD;
wide."&#xD;
"Heavens, Thomas! what made you such a&#xD;
mimic! I have been thinking-1 heard all this&#xD;
myself!'&#xD;
"0Old Michel has been a great deal in my&#xD;
hut, lady. Because I used to speak French&#xD;
when I was young, he came to talk French to&#xD;
me, and has tried more than once to get me&#xD;
into work with him which would have been&#xD;
creditable to no man. I am used to his words&#xD;
and wads, and in describing what'he sai1, spoke&#xD;
just as .he did. But to go on, Miss Sadia, as&#xD;
soon as- I saw that their boats were anchored,&#xD;
and no alterations made in the plans I so provi-&#xD;
dentially discoveed, I roused up 'Nap' and the&#xD;
other boy, and hurried back to report, as X&#xD;
have done."&#xD;
"And now that they are ahead of us, what&#xD;
can we do? Can we not go back and take the&#xD;
wagons and teams, and boldly drive off cast to&#xD;
Baltimore ?"&#xD;
"Ah, lady, I f. ar caution has not yet suf-&#xD;
ficiently been developed in you to make a safe&#xD;
commander. There were thirteen of the Vigi-&#xD;
lance Committee only in the boats -from the&#xD;
neighborhood of Springland ! Where do you&#xD;
think .the rest are ? With full knowledge of&#xD;
what we have done, we never could return there&#xD;
and live-not to speak of escape!'&#xD;
"True-true! W hat can we do? 'Is there&#xD;
no hope ?" poor Sadiaexcl:imed, almost wildly.&#xD;
"Yes, there is hope. But we can only reach&#xD;
success now i brough patience! !Fortunately,&#xD;
after the closest examination, they have biassed&#xD;
the channel to his retreat without discovering&#xD;
it. They will not examine the points they&#xD;
have passed so closely again.. What we have&#xD;
now to do, is, to wait here until, tired of search,&#xD;
they believe that you have escaped, and return!&#xD;
We have provisions, and can command more.&#xD;
I will keep a daily and nightly watch on the&#xD;
river, and after they have returned, we ivill try&#xD;
to evade the pickets; for they, at least, will not&#xD;
be so strongly on the look out for us then as&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"Well, it must be so, I suppose. Our people&#xD;
can soon build rude shelters for themselves, for&#xD;
thak will be needful if storms should come on."&#xD;
"Of course-but no fire must be made ex-&#xD;
cept in my large fire-place. A sminoke might&#xD;
draw attention here, if made out in the open&#xD;
air. There is plenty of room for cooking at&#xD;
that fire, and we shall have no colder weather&#xD;
than this," said the old fisherman, pausing for&#xD;
Sadia to precede him into the cabin, at whiel&#xD;

after their slow walk and long conversation,&#xD;
they had just arrived.&#xD;
"Supper done ready, honey! De old gal&#xD;
was jest agwine for call you!" said the privi-&#xD;
leged old nurse as Sadia entered.&#xD;
-     CHAPTER X.&#xD;
The advice of honest old Tom Hunter wag the&#xD;
only thing which Sadia, with her party, could&#xD;
follow under the circumstances. And as soon&#xD;
as the negroes knew that they were to remain&#xD;
some days in the beautiful spot to which they&#xD;
had been conducted, they at once set themselves&#xD;
to rearing comfortable huts near the first cabin.&#xD;
In a short time this was done, and when, on the&#xD;
afternoon of the third day, Thomas came up for&#xD;
a short visit from his post of observation, leav-&#xD;
ing Napoleon on the lookout, he said:&#xD;
"I believe the niggers would soon make them-&#xD;
selves as comfortable here as anywhere, Miss&#xD;
Sadia. They can laugh at a storm now, and I&#xD;
see that fish, terrapin, rabbits, possums, and&#xD;
coons are a drug with them. If it wasn't for&#xD;
the war, you might start a splendid plantation&#xD;
on a siall scale here! This prairie would grow&#xD;
about everything that ever was raised on the&#xD;
soil of Maryland !"&#xD;
Sadia smiled, faintly.&#xD;
"I thank you, TnQmas," said she, "for doing&#xD;
all you can, in words and deeds, to render this&#xD;
delay supportable. But I shall never feel at&#xD;
ease until my journey is over, and I am under&#xD;
the protection of the strong arm of the Federal&#xD;
Government !"&#xD;
"I hope that will be in a few days, lady; the&#xD;
party will'not remain long below. Failing in&#xD;
overtaking us, they will think, perhaps, we&#xD;
have landed somewhere on the river, found&#xD;
'friends, and gone on an overland route. At&#xD;
any rate, they will not hit the right track !"&#xD;
"I pray Heaven they may not !" said Sadia.&#xD;
"But is it not darkening up very suddenly,&#xD;
Thomas ? I feel as if a storm was coming up !"&#xD;
"There is; I have noticed signs of it all&#xD;
day ! I hope the hands have gathered you&#xD;
plenty of'dry wood ; for a good fire, in a dreary&#xD;
night, is a great comfort. Many a night, in my&#xD;
old cabin, when the Potomac ran at its height,&#xD;
and the storm was loud and wild, with a huge&#xD;
.fire roaring under my dry roof, I have listened&#xD;
to the turmoil without; thought of old times&#xD;
when storms were nothing to me, and been as&#xD;
happy as-as I ever have been for the last&#xD;
forty years ! But we are going to have an awful&#xD;
storm. There will be nothing more on the&#xD;
river this night. The hands may as weR come&#xD;
In from fishing and work at once, and our boats&#xD;
be got out of the stream and turned bottom&#xD;
side up! I will see. to this now, and you look&#xD;
out and make them bring you in plenty of wood&#xD;
'and fresh bedding, good lady. The storim may&#xD;
last a night, or even longer."-&#xD;
And the old man hurried away, for one of&#xD;
&#xD;
SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
"1k&#xD;
&#xD;
"A&#xD;
.4&#xD;
&#xD;
those sudden entire overvailing of the skies,&#xD;
common in southern latitudes, but seldom seen&#xD;
so far north-as even-the Potomac, had occurred;&#xD;
and though it was yet far from the hour of sun-&#xD;
down, the atmosphere became almost as dark as&#xD;
night.&#xD;
The negroes did not require to' be called in&#xD;
from fishing or labor ; with their instinctive&#xD;
terror of a thunderstorm, they were already&#xD;
seen hurrying in, some bringing dry wood,&#xD;
others fish and game, but all making for head-&#xD;
quarters as fast as possible. Thomas stopped&#xD;
a few of the strongest of the men, to assist him&#xD;
in securing 'the boats. This had barely been&#xD;
done, and the party under shelter, when it seem-&#xD;
ed as if all the artillery of heaven had opened&#xD;
at once. Flash after flash of lightning ran zig-&#xD;
zag tijro igh the air, almost blindingly' Bright,;&#xD;
the thunder pealed incessantly; the terrified&#xD;
negroes huddled together in the large cabin, and&#xD;
crouched down in silent terror.&#xD;
Sadia stood by the door, which she kept open,&#xD;
and looked out with an admiration of the grand&#xD;
and fearful in Nature intuitive to such souls as&#xD;
hers. Old Thomas seemed pleased with her&#xD;
bravery, showing, as it did, the difference be-&#xD;
tween mental strength and weakness, for there,&#xD;
at her feet, cowered stalwart blacks, able to rend&#xD;
her limb from limb, now struck with mortal&#xD;
terror at that which they had seen many a&#xD;
time.&#xD;
For a short time, though it seemed long to&#xD;
them, this terrible electrical battle of the clouds&#xD;
went on; then, rent asunder, the black masses&#xD;
poured down their torrents of sun-"drawn moist-&#xD;
ure. Never had Sadia seen rain come down so&#xD;
pitilessly, she thought, and she was thankful&#xD;
that her people were so well sheltered ; for, dry&#xD;
and cheerful, now that the terrifying thunder&#xD;
and lightning had passed away, they sat and&#xD;
chatted before the huge fire, seeming as happy&#xD;
as if fear never had found a place in their&#xD;
breasts, or care either.&#xD;
"You did not seem to fear the storm at all,&#xD;
Miss Sadia I" said Thomas, as, with her permis-&#xD;
sion, he lighted his pipe, and took a seat where&#xD;
its smoke found a draught up the, chimney.&#xD;
"Oh, noI" she replied, with enthusiasm. "I&#xD;
never was. From a child, I have watched the&#xD;
rushing clouds, the forest trees writhing in the&#xD;
gale, and listened to the 'deep-toned thunder,&#xD;
not with fear, but with a sort of wild pleasure I&#xD;
When the bright lightning ,played among the&#xD;
dark clefts of the cloud-mountains, gildiing their&#xD;
rough edges, and racing hither and thither like&#xD;
a serpent of fire, I have clapped my hands&#xD;
gleefu3y-it seemed so wildly grand !"&#xD;
"I, too,lady,have looked upon storms as you&#xD;
do--but before the thought of their grandeur&#xD;
passes away, another thought -that of the evil&#xD;
they may have done to the helpless-comes&#xD;
upon my mind.&#xD;

were, pent by Warburton de Mont-&#xD;
&#xD;
may have been stricken down by th'e flash&#xD;
which darted down from the dark cloud; of the&#xD;
build inn fired ; of the woe worked by the fiery&#xD;
bolt ofdestruction. And when the gale lasbes&#xD;
our beautiful river into snowy foam, and I see&#xD;
great forest trees wribbe, and groan, and bow&#xD;
before the strength of the wind, I think of some&#xD;
giant ship, filled with a precious freight of hu-&#xD;
man lives, battling against the might of the'ter-&#xD;
rible storm I see her breasting the mountain&#xD;
surges, and steering for some port of safety-&#xD;
eyery one of her crew awake to danger, but&#xD;
sternly striving to meet and overcome it ! I see&#xD;
her sails riven from the yards-her spaTs swept&#xD;
away frn th'*ir strong fastenings-the power&#xD;
to steer her lost. I see brave men turn pale,&#xD;
and feeble ones' grow strong, not for hope of&#xD;
life, but because there is no hope below, and&#xD;
they look above. I see the great waves dash&#xD;
the helpless ship upon the hidden rock-:-in an&#xD;
agony of thought I see her shattered, her crew&#xD;
all battling with the mad waters ! They strug-&#xD;
gle-a moment, and they are gone ! The storm&#xD;
sweeps on in its wild beauty, and laughs a&#xD;
maniac laugh over its work !"&#xD;
So wrapped in his thoughts had Thomas be-&#xD;
come that his looks as well as his words betray-&#xD;
ed the intensity of his feeling, and the very&#xD;
negroes looked up at him with awe, as if he was&#xD;
some superior being, speaking of things above&#xD;
all human ken.&#xD;
"I little thought there was so-- much true&#xD;
poetry in your heart, Mr. Hunter," said Sadia,&#xD;
her own eyes moistened with the picture he&#xD;
drew. "S&amp;amp;-much real feeling-so much deep&#xD;
thought!"&#xD;
" Al, lady I" he sighed, "Thomas Hunter is&#xD;
not now what he once was. Once he had high&#xD;
hopes, bright aspirations, cherished friends.&#xD;
One evil hour-one mad act, regretted ere it&#xD;
was done, and those hopes fell, those aspirations&#xD;
were clouded forever, and he fled away from the&#xD;
love of woman and of man, and tried to ha e&#xD;
even himself! But I will not speak of the past&#xD;
-I will only look forward to my duty now, and&#xD;
hope for wu end upon some glorious field, where&#xD;
the flag of my country floats victorious and de-&#xD;
fiant above the trophies won from its enemies!&#xD;
The storm is breaking away, and I must go&#xD;
down to the river to see if poor Napoleon and&#xD;
his mate haven't been washed away or scared&#xD;
out of existence!'&#xD;
The old man, without waiting to hear Sadia's&#xD;
intended remonstrance about his going out,&#xD;
strode forth in the darkness, and was gone in a&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
"Strange man1" she murmured. "I wish&#xD;
that I knew his history, yet I dare not ask more&#xD;
than he has chosen to reveal, for fear of wound-&#xD;
ing his feelings."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
fort and his party on the Potomac before they&#xD;
reached that point, but a short distance then&#xD;
above Washington, where the power cf the&#xD;
Federal arms was felt on both sides of the river.&#xD;
And the search after Sadia and the children and&#xD;
his slaves, though conducted with every energy&#xD;
upon his part, aided by the cousumate cunning&#xD;
of the old French corsair, Michel, had been ut-&#xD;
terly unavailing. lie had neither seen a sign of&#xD;
or heard the slightest tidings from the fugitives.&#xD;
What had become of them, what, track they had&#xD;
taken, he could not divine IIe had seen that&#xD;
the river was so 'closely picketed that boats&#xD;
could not pass unquestioned ; he had even met&#xD;
inconvenience, Rebel though he nas, from the&#xD;
closeness of the scrutiny which he had to un-&#xD;
dergo.&#xD;
On the morning of the fourth day, the party&#xD;
landed at the house of a well-known guerrilla&#xD;
chief, who has since risen to a high rank in the&#xD;
Rebel service ; for, not daring to go further fpr&#xD;
fear of arrest, they wished to hold a general&#xD;
council, to decide upon future action.&#xD;
And as we are to be present at the interview,&#xD;
reader, and our friend, Thomas Hunter, has given&#xD;
us a mimic representation of one of the party,&#xD;
we will take a thorough look at him before the&#xD;
"meeting comes to order".&#xD;
Carl Michel, as you choose to call yourself,&#xD;
stand for your picture.  That face, as near&#xD;
copper-color as the sun and wind of many sea-&#xD;
sons can make it, is se:irred in a dozen places&#xD;
with scars received in many a deadly affray. If&#xD;
report speaks true, your limbs and body bear&#xD;
marks from bullets, pikes, sabres, and bayonets,&#xD;
suflieient to have won you a marshalship under&#xD;
Napoleon le Grand I Your short gray hair and&#xD;
carefully-triinmred but huge mustache are of the&#xD;
cut of the ancient grenadiers of the line-the&#xD;
men of the Old Guard. 'Erect yet as a lance,&#xD;
powerful in shouldter and broad in loin, though&#xD;
full sixty years have passed over your sinful&#xD;
head, you are more than a match for most active&#xD;
young men. Used, as you say, to war on sea&#xD;
and on land, accustomed to smuggling, familiar&#xD;
with all weapons, you are a rough customer.&#xD;
Yes, Sir ; and that half-sailot' dress and military&#xD;
cap set off your trim old figure very well for a&#xD;
picture.&#xD;
Villain though you are by your own acknowl-&#xD;
edgement, you are worth ten such paltry rene-&#xD;
gades as Randolph Beverly. And yet for good&#xD;
pay you are Teady to serve hint or any other&#xD;
man, so long as your employers do.uot draw&#xD;
you away from the service of him who claims&#xD;
your first allegiance-old Satan himself.&#xD;
To the house of the guerrilla alluded to, who&#xD;
was temporarily absent from home, the three&#xD;
leaders of the pursuit after Sxdia repaired wheh&#xD;
it was decided that, they could go no further&#xD;
down the river. The house, though not origin-&#xD;
ally a house of entertainment, had become so&#xD;
public as the head-quarters of guerrillas, Rebel&#xD;

head of a few as reckless devils as himself, and&#xD;
succeed ; but to charge over the barrierswhich&#xD;
every man with a chivalrous heart in his bosom&#xD;
respects-he wouldit do it.&#xD;
Little was said by the, trio while the substan-&#xD;
tial supper was under discussion in a practical&#xD;
way. Ham    and eggs, fish and oysters, corn-&#xD;
bread and chicken fixings, all went the way of&#xD;
doomed flesh and fish very rapidly.    The&#xD;
drink was still apple-jack, now mellowed with&#xD;
a little sugar and weakened with a little water,&#xD;
for tea would be an insult to an eleven-o'clock&#xD;
supper for a Southern gentleman.&#xD;
While it was in progress, however, thought&#xD;
was busy in the brains of at least one of the&#xD;
party. And when they sat back and lighted&#xD;
fresh cigars, he said&#xD;
"If Stuart would only come, he would find&#xD;
some way to aid us in learning whether the&#xD;
party have reached Washington or not.&#xD;
It was Warburton who spoke. Almost at the&#xD;
same instant, the rapid galloping of a horse was&#xD;
heard for a few moments, and then it ceased, as&#xD;
the rider drew up before the house.       s&#xD;
"Suppose zat what zey say in ze old time,&#xD;
come to ze veritie, eh ?-zat when you speak of&#xD;
le diable, he come; zen zat gentilhomme zat 'ave&#xD;
just come must be le Capitaine Stuart, eh ?"&#xD;
said Michel, with as much of a smile as his&#xD;
scarred old visage ever could wear upon it.&#xD;
"You may be right. I will see, at any rate,"&#xD;
said Warburton, rising and leaving the room.&#xD;
He returned in a few moments afterward, ac-&#xD;
companied by a man of about middle height,&#xD;
thin-formed, and thin-faced, but whose eye, as&#xD;
bright as that of.the eagle, seemed to pierce&#xD;
the person he looked upon. His frame, though&#xD;
light, was lithe and sinewy; and a glance would&#xD;
tell any observant man that he was active and&#xD;
powerful. He wore a plain suit of gray, well&#xD;
covered with mud, showing that he had been&#xD;
riding haid and recklessly, heavy top-boots,&#xD;
with spurs at the heels. The butt of a revolver&#xD;
could be seen where his coat lacked a button at&#xD;
the waist ; but no other weapon was in sight.&#xD;
"Gentlemen, here is our host, Captain Stuart,&#xD;
of the Independent Confederate Rangers," said&#xD;
- Warburton, as the two entered the room.&#xD;
One of the party-Michel--needed no intro-&#xD;
duction, for Stuart at once grasped and hearti-&#xD;
ly shook his hand.&#xD;
"I'm  glad to see you, old friend," said he.&#xD;
"Have you made any more Yankees dance for&#xD;
you lately ?"&#xD;
"Ali, ha! Capitaine, you have bon memoire,"&#xD;
said Michel, with a grin, as he thought of an&#xD;
act of his to which the Captain alluded. " Zat&#xD;
was one ver fine dance, only ze music was too&#xD;
slow, eh? Ha, ha! It was ver fine."&#xD;
"I must tell you about that scrape before&#xD;
you go, Montfort ; it was rare fun," said the&#xD;
&#xD;
guerrilla chief. "But now tell me about this&#xD;
business of yours, and let me see what I can do&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
"Will you not take a dose of something&#xD;
strong to take the chill of the night air from&#xD;
your veins ?" asked Beverly, with a studied air&#xD;
of politeness, as he pushed the decaneer over&#xD;
toward Stuart.&#xD;
"Thank you ; no," said the latter. "A man&#xD;
who has ridden forty miles in less than five&#xD;
hours cannot have felt much chill in his veins,&#xD;
you may well suppose. Go on, Moutfort. I&#xD;
am waiting for you."&#xD;
Warburton now stated all about the exodus&#xD;
of Sadia and the slaves, not, however, saying&#xD;
anything about its real cause, leaving Stuart to&#xD;
suppose that her Union feelinge alone had actu-&#xD;
ated her. When he mentioned her supposed&#xD;
guide, old Thomas Hunter, Stuart shook his&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"She has one of the best men for the busi-&#xD;
ness in the country. I know him. lie has&#xD;
hunted and fished on tlle river foi' twenty-five&#xD;
or thirty years at least. lie is an educated&#xD;
man, and was born a gentleman, and, I have&#xD;
been told, was once an officer in the Army."&#xD;
"He don't look much like one in his latter&#xD;
days," said Warburton, contemptuously.&#xD;
"Nevare mind zat. I 'ave tell you before&#xD;
zat hLone soldier, said Michel. "'Ave not&#xD;
I talk wiz him upon ze science de guerre in ze&#xD;
language of France? Ccrtainemert , I 'ave so&#xD;
done. He smart like ze di2ble, nevare would he&#xD;
escape old Carl Michel. Nevare !"&#xD;
"Our river pickets are too much on the&#xD;
alert, it seems to me, for any boat to pass them.&#xD;
For upon them do we depend to keep much in-&#xD;
formation away from the Federals. Yet you&#xD;
think your sister and her party must have&#xD;
reached the city ?" said Stuart.&#xD;
"Yes; for I cannot imagine where else she can&#xD;
be, and there would be her only near place to&#xD;
find protection in her cursed plans."&#xD;
"Well, it can be ascertained if she is there.&#xD;
My girls manage, one or the other of them, to&#xD;
get down there every day or two. They are ac-&#xD;
quainted with several of the leading clerks of&#xD;
the different departments, and with most of the&#xD;
reporters. It will be ascertained to a certainty&#xD;
by this time to-morrow evening whether they&#xD;
are in the city or not. So rest easy upon that&#xD;
score."&#xD;
"A  thousand thanks, my good friend -a&#xD;
thousand thanks !" said Waarburton, joyously.&#xD;
"I have renewed hope now."&#xD;
"When you return, you do not propose going&#xD;
back in your boats, I hope," said Stuart, sudden-&#xD;
ly changing the subject.&#xD;
"I razzare ziuk it would be one big fool idea&#xD;
to do zat! It take us 'ten day zat way-we go&#xD;

"But where will we find horses ?" suggested&#xD;
Beverly.&#xD;

"Do not trouble yourself about that. There&#xD;

horses, I make them pay for their folly by bor-&#xD;
rowing the horses of such men for the use of&#xD;
myself and the Confederacy," said Stuart. "If&#xD;
[ you recover your whole party, Union men shall&#xD;
4 find transportation for them. They give what&#xD;
I ask, and never grumble-before me, at least,&#xD;
for I always carry a lariat at the ring of my&#xD;
s saddle, and a few of them have seen the lariat-&#xD;
dance, haven't they, Michel ?"&#xD;
"Ha! ha! yes, Captain; zat dance to slow&#xD;

4 And the old corsair's eyes sparkled, as he re-&#xD;
membered, probably, the ferocities of the follow-&#xD;
ers of Marat, Danton, and Robespierre.&#xD;
" Can you get to Washington to-night, Kate ?"&#xD;
asked Captain Stuart of the same daughter who&#xD;
had waited upon the party before, and who&#xD;
now came in .answer to the bell which he had&#xD;
Krung.&#xD;
"I can ride down to the Long Bridge to-&#xD;
Snight, father, and get passed over early in the&#xD;
Morningg" was the reply.-&#xD;
9  "That will do, dear ; get ready. I have&#xD;
d work for you. Take the black horse; he is&#xD;
r swift, sure footed, and used t" that road, and&#xD;
~it is dark to-night!"&#xD;
wr," Yes, father." And the beautiful girl hurried&#xD;
away.&#xD;
"You surely will not send her. out alone on&#xD;
N such a night as this toward the Federal lines?"&#xD;
said Warburton, in astonishment. "She cannot&#xD;
Have numbered eighteen summers !"&#xD;
" Only sixteen," said Stuart, with a smile.&#xD;
" But she can ride wherever a horse can carry&#xD;
Mme ; and the man upon whom she raises her&#xD;
;evolver may, as well breathe his last prayer to&#xD;
God. I have no fears for her safety ; little.&#xD;
t ate Stuart can take care of herself; and before&#xD;
ewe sleep to-morrow night you will learn through&#xD;
er all that can be learned of your party in&#xD;
ashington. Have you any likeness of your;&#xD;
ester with you-if so, let me have it, for I must&#xD;
low go to give my girl her final instructions."&#xD;
" Beverly has one which he can lend for the&#xD;
oceas ion, I presumed; for he borrowed it of nec&#xD;
an year rogo, and has never returned it, though&#xD;
have seen it often in his possession," said&#xD;
Varburton. '&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
The young Lieutenart affected to be slightly&#xD;
confused-confusion in a sailor, ye gods! But&#xD;
he took out his pocket-book, and from within it&#xD;
produced a photograph of Sadia.&#xD;
"A queenly-looking girl, by Jove !" muttered&#xD;
Stuart, as he looked at the picture. "I would&#xD;
know her among a thousand. Kate will take&#xD;
this with her, and return it safely. Now, gen-&#xD;
tlemen, enjoy yourselves over your bottles and&#xD;
cigars, and when you feel weary, rooms will be&#xD;
ready for you. You can do nothing before&#xD;
to-morrow night, so take things easy. In the&#xD;
morning, I may have a word to say about your&#xD;
boats ; we shall need a good many in a short&#xD;
time, and probably can make it advantageous to&#xD;
you to part with yours. Good-night."&#xD;
And the guerilla left them to their enjoy-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
ChAPTER XII.&#xD;
Kate Stuart was the favorite child of her&#xD;
bold and dashing father, because in many points&#xD;
her character was so like his own. Apparent-&#xD;
lv insensible to fear, she was daring and grace-&#xD;
ful in horsemanship; and, as he had remark-&#xD;
ed, if she fired her revolver at a living thing-&#xD;
bird, beast, or man--death would surely follow&#xD;
the certainty of her aim. She was, strange to&#xD;
say, as lady-like in her demeanor, and as calm&#xD;
and self-possessed within doors, as the best bred&#xD;
belle that ever, turned hearts wild at Saratoga,&#xD;
or drove men into dissipation despairingly at&#xD;
Newport. Her father's means had enabled&#xD;
him to have her educated in every accomplish-&#xD;
ment; and young as she was, in music, lan-&#xD;
guages, general knowledge she was well versed..&#xD;
And throwing himself right into the front of&#xD;
the dark army of, Secessionism, he was already&#xD;
using her in many ways to aid his ambitious&#xD;
plans - for the plan of every leader in that&#xD;
mad scheme was founded not upon even the&#xD;
supposed good of his country,' but upon his&#xD;
own personals ambition! This may be said to&#xD;
be an opinion; but their every act proves it to&#xD;
be based upon the foundation of truth.&#xD;
When Captain Stuart left the room where his&#xD;
guests were, he repaired to another on the first&#xD;
door, wb-ich he called his armory. It might also&#xD;
have been termed a museum, for in the variety&#xD;
and style of arms there was everything to&#xD;
choose from. It seemed as if the old heroes of&#xD;
the Revolution, the Hessians and the Yagers,-&#xD;
and even the Red Men of the forest, had helped&#xD;
to swell his stock.  Flint lock and percussion,&#xD;
single and double-barreled, guns, pistols, rifles,&#xD;
and revolvers were packed in the corners, or hung&#xD;
upon the walls. Old Scottish broadsword, ship-&#xD;
cutlasses, old rapiers,.regular sabres, all were&#xD;
scattered about looking grim and rusty, but dan-&#xD;
gerous for all that.&#xD;
So large and various was the collection, that&#xD;
I have no doubt the old woman's gun could have&#xD;
been found in it-the one which she remember-&#xD;

&#xD;
afternoon and evening visits, and his income&#xD;

Before the Rebeiiion broke out, and after,&#xD;
Barney had been besieged -by both Secesh and&#xD;
Federal, to know which side he was on.&#xD;
"Nayther side, monies !" hiewould invariably&#xD;
reply. "Sure it's meself that is not yet natur-&#xD;

Divilfthe bit. IL's more sense the mother left&#xD;

And both Rebels and Federals would laugh&#xD;
at his jokes, or he preserved his neutrality in&#xD;
acts as well as words, and did not seen to care&#xD;
an iota which whipped, as the woman said when&#xD;
the bear tackled her husband. -&#xD;
But after the war opened, the custom of Bart&#xD;
ney sadly fl1 off--it was neither so regular nor&#xD;
so sure as before. And now-but we will not&#xD;
anticipate the history of Barney Sullivan, but&#xD;
simply bring in so much of him and his as is&#xD;
connected with our story.&#xD;
Him and his, I said. For there was a lady,&#xD;
the only queen lie said that he'd ever sworn&#xD;
"allaygeance to", and that was Mrs. Kathleen&#xD;
Sullivan, whom he regarded as the " naytest&#xD;
;it" of womanity that ever danced a jig, and&#xD;
who regarded him ns a long ways ahead of all&#xD;
uclher men, kings and Presidents included.&#xD;
At this house Kate Stuart arrived about an&#xD;
hour before daylight on the night when we saw&#xD;
er leave her father's house. The house was&#xD;
within the Federal lines, and she had passed&#xD;
them safely-how, was best known to herself.&#xD;
Riding directly through the carriage-yard&#xD;
around to the back of the house, she dashed her&#xD;
horse over a little picket thatencl'osed a flower-&#xD;
plot, and riding up one of the paths until she&#xD;
was beside the house, she reached out the butt&#xD;
of her riding whil', and lightly tapped upon&#xD;
one of the window-sashes.&#xD;
At first, there was no answer-everything&#xD;
was still about the house, but a watch-dog in&#xD;
the stables set up an infernal racket.&#xD;
She struck several harder blows, and in a&#xD;
moment they had the desired effect.&#xD;
"Faith an' who is that thumpin' there when&#xD;
we're all as sound asleep as ever Jonah was in&#xD;
the belly of the say-sarpint ! Who are you-&#xD;
spake, or I'll be after hati' the taykittle, and&#xD;
sealdin' ye off!"&#xD;
"Don't put yourself to such trouble, Mr.&#xD;
Sullivan ! But rouse up your hostler, and have&#xD;
my horse taken care of, and tell that rosy-cheek-&#xD;
ed wife of yours that Kate Stuart wants to shake&#xD;
hands with her !"&#xD;
"Howls saints-it is her! Wake up, Kath-&#xD;
leen-wake up,, darling! It's your favorite, the.&#xD;
&#xD;
Captain's daughter, out there in the could! Up&#xD;
wid you, dear, and on wid a shawl, and bring&#xD;
her in, whileI start up the hostler, and make&#xD;
her a bit o' somethin' warm to kape death from&#xD;
the young heart of her !"&#xD;
While Barney was talking, he was not idle,&#xD;
but soon a light appeared in one room, and&#xD;
then in another, and by the time pate had dis-&#xD;
mounted, her horse was taken charge of by&#xD;
Barney himself, while at the door she was met&#xD;
by the rosy-cheecked wife in question, who, in&#xD;
not very full dress, embraced her warmly1 and&#xD;
hurried her into a snug little parlor, where she&#xD;
left her until she (Mrs. S.) could make herself&#xD;
"a bit dacent", to use her own words.&#xD;
She was only gone a few moments, when she&#xD;
came in as tidy as if she had just come from a&#xD;
May-day ball, bringing a glass of wine-negus&#xD;
right fromu the hands of Barney, who sent her&#xD;
word it must be taken to kill the chill of the&#xD;
morning.&#xD;
"I'll take it more to please you and Barney&#xD;
than for the real need I have of it !" said Kate,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
And she drank the carefully-prepared bever-&#xD;
age, which her rapid night journey did not rev-&#xD;
der unnecessary. For she had ridden many&#xD;
miles at a gallop, and could not but have felt;&#xD;
some, fatigue.&#xD;
"And now, my good Kathleen," she said,&#xD;
take me to a room-where I can wash up, and-&#xD;
make myself as good-looking as I can, for I am&#xD;
going over to Washington after an early break-&#xD;
fast, to see if I can find some man that looks&#xD;
anything like your Barney for a husband, for&#xD;
I'm getting afraid of living single. Look how I&#xD;
have to travel now I"&#xD;
And she exhibited her belt of arms.&#xD;
rTake these playthings, and lock them up for&#xD;
me, too, my dear Mrs. Sullivan, where no one will&#xD;
sec them till I come back from the eity; for I&#xD;
might scare away an offer, you know, if I wore&#xD;
them."&#xD;
And the laughing girl unclasped the belt, and&#xD;
handed it to her hostess.&#xD;
"The Lord love us! she calls these play-&#xD;
things !" said Mrs. Sullivan, as she looked as-&#xD;
kant at the deadly weapons which she hurried to&#xD;
put out of her hands into a bureau-drawer, which&#xD;
she locked, and banding the key over to Kate,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Sure, it's myself, Miss Kate, that nayther&#xD;
likes the handling or care of them sort of play-&#xD;
things, as you call 'em! And I'd rather have&#xD;
a good man, like my Barney, to take care of&#xD;
me, than a dozen pair of 'em, so ' would. Come,&#xD;
now, to a room, ,and I'll be dressin'-maid for ye,&#xD;
as I was once to Lady Clanorgin, at the Castle,&#xD;
and sure you're thousan' times handsomer than&#xD;
ever she was, for she had hair as red as ould&#xD;
copper, and a face as speckled as a guinea-hen's&#xD;
egg. And her shape ! it was no shape at all, as&#xD;
Barney says of a naygur's foot."&#xD;

funny ?"&#xD;
"Faith, I don't know, without it is like other&#xD;
matters wid our nation. Ould Ingland has made&#xD;
many a bloody war, but Irishmen have to fight&#xD;
them out for her. So people have to laugh, and&#xD;
if we didn't make the fun for 'em to laugh, who&#xD;
would? But there ! I hear my Barney calling&#xD;
my name. It's a cane shirt, bayhap, the dar-&#xD;
n' is wantin' ; for he always puts his best fut&#xD;
foremost when you come to the "Shamrock", Miss&#xD;
Kate.  Sure an' if I hadn't a lane title to his&#xD;
hand and heart, it's jealous I'd be of the man !&#xD;
Hurry and wash up! There's combs, brushes,&#xD;
and plenty of soap, water, and tooaels in the&#xD;
room. Breakfast will be ready as soon as your&#xD;
swate little mouth is ready for it."&#xD;
And the cheery little woman, having shown&#xD;
Kate to her room, disappeared in the direction&#xD;
from which she last heard the musical voice of&#xD;
her husband.&#xD;
Kateremoved herdark riding-mantalet and gray&#xD;
riding-skirt, and developed a very neat figure&#xD;
in a dress of dark blue merino. Taking off, also,&#xD;
a pair of riding-boots, made men-fashion, which&#xD;
might have been numbers four or five, she ex-&#xD;
hibited still a neat two-and-a-half gaiter-boot&#xD;
over her little foot, which had thus been pre-&#xD;
served from mud and other injury. And let-&#xD;
ting down the long curling hair which had&#xD;
been-netted up for the ride, she shook it out,&#xD;
and then dipping her sweet face and dimpled&#xD;
hands into the bowl filled with sparkling water,&#xD;
' she soon removed all traces of travel and fa-&#xD;
tigue.&#xD;
When, half an hour later, she went back into&#xD;
Kathleen's parlor, the little woman could not,&#xD;
for the life of her, help catching her in her arms,&#xD;
and kissing her,'vowing all the time that she&#xD;
looked more like a fairy than a woman.&#xD;
And Barney, tod, soon came in, and his tongue&#xD;
was as profuse in its delivery of flattering com-&#xD;
pliments as that of his wife, and his droll ex-&#xD;
pressions kept Kate laughing till the tears ran&#xD;
down her cheeks.&#xD;
"I have a favor to ask of you to-day, Mr. Sul-&#xD;
livan," she said, as soon as she could get quiet&#xD;
enough to speak.&#xD;
"Faith, anything but my allaygance to Kath-&#xD;
leen yonder you may ask, lady, widout danger&#xD;
of a refusal from Barney."&#xD;
"This favor is not so serious as to endanger&#xD;
your allegiance anywhere. You have a pass fo&#xD;
yourself and family over into the city, have yo&#xD;
"Troth I have, and small danger of my losing&#xD;

"Oh, what a whopper you tould me an hour&#xD;

a husband as good-lookin' as Barney you said&#xD;
you was afther !" cried Kathleen, laughing.&#xD;
"Why couldn't you keep my secret, you&#xD;
talkative woman, you!" exclaimed Kati, in&#xD;
feigned anger. "Now he'll be running down&#xD;
every good-looking man he meets, and I'll have&#xD;
no chance at all !"&#xD;
"The Lord preserve the hearts you'll break&#xD;
before the day is out !" said Barney, laughing.&#xD;
"But will you take me over !'&#xD;
"To be sure I will, my darling.  And if an -&#xD;
ugly man squints at you, I'll spake of Bladens-&#xD;

chairs on the piazza fronting the river. "I&#xD;
iave been promised a regular cavalry command&#xD;
-to raise it to a brigade, if I can. You shall have&#xD;
good berth in it if you wilbeome ?"&#xD;
"I zank you, Capi aine--i zank you! You do&#xD;
ne much honare ! 3ut I 'ave been promised a&#xD;
hief part in one grand enterprise ; one mag.&#xD;
ificent speculacione, zat 'ave witz its dangare&#xD;

ill try. If zat enterprize fail, and yet I sur-&#xD;
ivc, I will come to you, mon cher Capitaine, in&#xD;
ny capacity zat you may permit!"&#xD;
"Well, you will not find me insensible to your&#xD;
erits, my dear fellow. Is your enterprise by&#xD;
nd or water ?"&#xD;
"Both, Capitaine-both. It would be to be-&#xD;
ay confidence to say anysing more before I&#xD;
ye permissione from zem zat engage me, or I&#xD;
ould tell you all !"&#xD;
"Oh, never mind that. I am generally as&#xD;
ttle curious about the secrets of others as I am&#xD;
trongly careful, on the opposite, of my own.&#xD;
o you suppose your party would like to go on&#xD;
horse-hunt, to-day?"&#xD;
"I will not speak for them. For myself, I&#xD;
could be delighted to go upon any kind of a&#xD;
unt. I like not to be still !"&#xD;
"I thought, as they will probably need horses&#xD;
go back on, they might not dislike to pass the&#xD;
y in making a trip with me of about twenty&#xD;
miles from here. We can cross the river in our&#xD;
oats, and take a couple of wagons that one of&#xD;
r friends has on the other fide, and reach thel&#xD;
ace I want to go to by noon. There are&#xD;
out thirty fine horses corralled there, that&#xD;
ill go to fill a contract with the Federal Gov-&#xD;
uncut next week, if I do not get them."   ]&#xD;
"Ah, zat would be von ver' gran' pitee! It&#xD;
uld be ver' wrong zat such good honestE&#xD;
'entilhomme as you and myself should need&#xD;
r horses, and ze Yankee 'ave zem so near&#xD;

"Ah, Michel, I'm afraid you've been a hard&#xD;

me, zen the devil always rise. When I 'ave&#xD;

Stuart could not help thinking that there was&#xD;
some philosophy in Michel's idea; and so he&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"By the way, Michel," he continued, "how&#xD;
have you got over your love affair over in&#xD;
Winchester, that you were sighing about when&#xD;
I saw you last ?"&#xD;
"Ah, Mon Dieul You mean ze widow! I&#xD;

"I tell him 1 will listen, and I will not get&#xD;

"He tell me zen zat ze widow was one grand&#xD;

"He did prove it ; and zen I was his friend&#xD;

"But the widow. How did you break with&#xD;

" Ah, Capitaine! you would ~'ave laugh to&#xD;

"And well you got out of it," laughed Stuart.&#xD;
"Excuse me, Michel ; it ia my breakfast hour;&#xD;
and I'm going to rouse your company, or they'll&#xD;
sleep all day."&#xD;
" Zat is right, Capitaine-zat is right. If we.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
There were few more stylish equipages than&#xD;
the doulJc-seated, Gothamn-built light wagon&#xD;
which Barney Sullivan brought out before the&#xD;
door of the 'Shamrock", for the purpose of&#xD;
carrying his Kathleen and Kate Stuart over to&#xD;
Wasdungton. la team, a pair of black Mor-&#xD;
gan mares, well matched, suited admirably to&#xD;
the size of the wagon ; and when the two wom-&#xD;
en-one of them very beautiful and the other&#xD;
decidedly good-looking-were in, and he on&#xD;
lthe iront seat, in his neat driving-coat, spotless&#xD;
gloves, and wE;-curled hair and whiskers, the&#xD;
whole turn-out was one that could nowhere pass&#xD;
unnoticed, even in the most stylish crowds.&#xD;
On the Virginia side of the river, soldiers,&#xD;
mostly, were the admirers of Barney's dashing&#xD;
show-for the most of t1 e civilians and all the&#xD;
open Secesh had move away, or, in the new&#xD;
phraseology of Dixie, they had skedaddled.&#xD;
It was but a short drive to the end of the&#xD;
Long Bridge, where a strong guard was placed,&#xD;
and where an officer examined the passes of all&#xD;
who crossed.&#xD;
He appeared to know Barney well, for he&#xD;
smiled good.naturedly as he drew up to exhibit&#xD;
his pass, and said&#xD;
"All right, mine host of the 'Shamrock'; you&#xD;
have shown your pass too often to need it now.&#xD;
If all on this side of the river were like you, I,&#xD;
too, could take a drive over to the city, instead&#xD;
of standing guard on this cursed bridge all&#xD;
day !".&#xD;
"Thank you, Lieutenant. When you're off&#xD;
duty, come out and see us. llammack sends&#xD;
me over prime oysters every day, and I've some&#xD;
capital shad on hand-not to speak of the nec-&#xD;
tar that you jolly sons of Mars love when duty&#xD;
permits its use,"&#xD;
And Barney drove on, while the officer, whose&#xD;
eye had rested admiringly but not with insolent&#xD;
boldness upon the form and face of Kate, still&#xD;
east a long, lingering gaze in her direction.&#xD;
"Who was that officer?" asked Kate, after&#xD;
they had passed out of hearing.&#xD;
"One of the Rhode Island boys-I forget his&#xD;
name. Ii'father is a big cotton manufacturer,&#xD;
and supplies him plentifully with money. lie&#xD;
has been over to my place with some of the&#xD;
Massachusetts Sixth several times."&#xD;
"His father had better have given him brains&#xD;
than money !" said Kate, quietly. "A man,&#xD;
bowe' 'er, in h sposition can be shot as well with-&#xD;
out brains as with them. He'll be food for our&#xD;
Southern buzzards one of these days !"&#xD;
"Like many qt better man. War is a divil-&#xD;
ish wasteful trade altogether !" said Barney,&#xD;
with a laugh.   Where do you wish to gxo to on&#xD;
the other side, Miss Kate- for well soon be&#xD;
over? My team ineasues miles nearly as fast as&#xD;
the locomotives on the railways do !"&#xD;
I am  willing to be left anywhere on the&#xD;
avenue, only so that I know where to find you&#xD;
&#xD;
when my business is over," said Kate. "Y&#xD;
can, if you like, drive me up as far as the Cal&#xD;
tol, and, if you stop near there, I will wa&#xD;
down."&#xD;
"I always put up my horses at Keogan'&#xD;
and my Kuthleen as a cousin close by, who&#xD;
she goes to have a chat when we are os&#xD;
We'll drive there, and then you'il see where&#xD;
come when you get iady. You needn't hui&#xD;
yourself, nor fear for any slip o Barne&#xD;
tongue, if you are over on business for y'&#xD;
father, as you may be; for he is a man afti&#xD;
my own heart, and has spent too many a fr&#xD;
dollar with mc, to let him or his ever be forge&#xD;
ten."&#xD;
"I thank you, Barney. Neither he nor Iw&#xD;
ever forget your kindness. I knew I could&#xD;
pen.l upon you, or I should not have asked ti&#xD;
favor I have. I may be delayed in my busing&#xD;
till night, or it may be settled in an hour or1 &#xD;
time. I will try and not inconvenience you&#xD;
your good Kathleen "&#xD;
"Don't inconvayniance yourself, or youll&#xD;
convayniance us, darling," was Kathleen's rep:&#xD;
as she pressed Kate's little hand.&#xD;
"And tell me, Birdie, didn't you forget y&#xD;
pocket-book last night, in the hurry of.comni&#xD;
away? because if you did, Barney Sulivan h&#xD;
got two or three cool hundred with him, to-da&#xD;
that he don't know how to get rid of."&#xD;
"Does this look as if I did, my good friend'&#xD;
asked Kate, with a laugh, as she took from b&#xD;
pocket a large silk purse, and showed it to hi&#xD;
well filled with gold. "Father never lets&#xD;
go without pocket-money."&#xD;
"The more glory to him, darling ; but&#xD;
meant no harm. I would serve you if I coul&#xD;
"I know it, Barney ; there are no friec&#xD;
whom I value more than I do t on and Kathle&#xD;
for in fair report orfoulyou are the same tour&#xD;
"And long may we live to be so! Ab,&#xD;
little lady, I saw that! 'lhat officer bowed v&#xD;
low, and you blushed. I'm sure he is as go&#xD;
looking as I am. Is he to be the happy man&#xD;
"No, indeed, you foolish fellow; he is onl&#xD;
passing acquaintance, who, one of these da&#xD;
may wish that he had never seen me. lie as'&#xD;
and got an introduction to me nlot long sin&#xD;
and-and that's all."&#xD;
"All that you mane to tell us just now,&#xD;
mane. Well, never mind ; it's not us will hot&#xD;
you about him any more. But he's a dcvi&#xD;
fine-looking fellow!"&#xD;
"It was him who made the charge at&#xD;
Cross Roads last week, and cut his way out o&#xD;
net laid for him by Ball's Cavalry. lie&#xD;
considerable credit for it-all he deserved&#xD;
reckon !"&#xD;
" Faith, I know his name now. 'I liked&#xD;
cut of his jib. A fighting man suits me,1 d&#xD;
care where I fiad him."&#xD;
I had rather find him on the side I am&#xD;
but if he is a man, I'll respect him anywh&#xD;
&#xD;
g&#xD;
&#xD;
Ah! Kathleen, how would you like to be that&#xD;
lady-the one in the open carriage whom we&#xD;
are just going to meet?"&#xD;
." What, the one with the driver and footman&#xD;
dressed in blue, with silver lace around their&#xD;
hatss"&#xD;
"Yes-the same."&#xD;
"Faith, I know who she is, and that she has&#xD;
a big man for a husband; but I'd rather be&#xD;
myself, with Barney here to look at and call&#xD;
my own, than to be the big woman she'll be for&#xD;
the four years she lives in the White House,&#xD;
and the little one she may be after that."&#xD;
"You don't think mch of the position of a&#xD;
President, it appears."&#xD;
"Faith, I wouldn't think much of heaven, if&#xD;
I was only to have a taste of it and then lose it."&#xD;
"You see the ould woman has a mind of her&#xD;
own, Miss Kate."&#xD;
Yes, and a sound one, too, Barney,'and you&#xD;
should be proud of it."&#xD;
"I am, sure ! But here we are,aforeninst her&#xD;
cousin's. Whenever we're wanted, you find the&#xD;
one or other of us here."&#xD;
"Very well; I will alight here also, Barney.&#xD;
I can walk where I wish to go," said Kate.&#xD;
And when Barney reined in she left the wagon.&#xD;
And, reader, for the present, we'll leave the&#xD;
party, for we are wanted elsewhere.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
After Warburton de Montfort and his party&#xD;
had breakfasted, Captain Stuart repeated to&#xD;
them the same information that he had given&#xD;
Michel in regard to the horses. And his propo-&#xD;
sition to make up an expedition to go after&#xD;
them was received with unanimous satisfaction&#xD;
by all the party except Randolph Beverly, who,&#xD;
consider ing it beneath the dignity of a naval&#xD;
officer to act as a horse marine, thought that he&#xD;
could spend his day far more pleasantly in get-&#xD;
ting up what'he considered a harmless flirtation&#xD;
with Captain Stuart's eldest daughter, Annie-&#xD;
who, of a different type of beauty from Kate,&#xD;
her sister, :also differed materially in character.&#xD;
For she was romantic and dreamy; she lacked&#xD;
the wild vigor of heart and body, the fiery dar-&#xD;
ing of soul, the utter independence, so to call it,&#xD;
of the younger but, in every apparent way,&#xD;
more matured sister. Beverly had read Annie's&#xD;
character at a glance, and he determined to study&#xD;
it further, for one day, at least, rather than to&#xD;
expose himself to the dangers and hardships of&#xD;
a guerrilla foray.&#xD;
Therefore, he made so many excuses of being&#xD;
fatigued, not very well, etc., that he was left be-&#xD;
hind to keep the landlady and her daughter&#xD;
company, while every other man about the place&#xD;
.joined the bold guerrilla chief on the expedi-&#xD;
*Lion.&#xD;
It was full nine o'clock in the day when the&#xD;
party crossed the river ; and Beverly, in his&#xD;
slippers, sat upon the piazza, and looked out&#xD;
&#xD;
upon them, as they crossed, with an indifferent&#xD;
laziness which quite provoked old Michel; fob&#xD;
the last words he said when bi left were:&#xD;
"if you no go wiz us to look for one horse to&#xD;
ride home upon, Messieur Beverlee, you need&#xD;
not suppose we bring you anysiog better zan a&#xD;
cow or a shackass for to ride upon! No, by&#xD;
dam-no !"&#xD;
Beverly laughed quietly, and, turning to Miss&#xD;
Annie, who was looking at the crossing with&#xD;
her great, dreamy, black eyes, said :&#xD;
"Do not you think, fair lady, that my choice&#xD;
of a quiet day with the gentler sex, to brighten&#xD;
it by their sweet presence, is preferable to a&#xD;
long ride over a muddy road, with only a horse&#xD;
to pay for the trouble at the end of it. Having&#xD;
the price cf more than one horse in my pocket,&#xD;
I believe it far more agreeable to hire rough&#xD;
work done than to perform it. What do you&#xD;
think, lady?'&#xD;
Annie started at.the last question, and blushed&#xD;
crimson, for her thoughts had been so dreamily&#xD;
pre-occupied that she had not heard one word&#xD;
of all this well-arranged opening for converse&#xD;
tion, and only knew that he had been saying&#xD;
something to her. Even its nature she knew&#xD;
not.&#xD;
"I was thinking of- of sister who went away&#xD;
last night, Sir, and did not hear what you were&#xD;
saying, Sir," she said. "Excuse my want of&#xD;
attention. When you speak again, I will try to&#xD;
be a listener rather than a dreamer."&#xD;
"Your sister must have had an unpleasant&#xD;
and perilous ride in the :night, it seems to me,"&#xD;
said Beverly, glad to get Annie into a conversa-&#xD;
tion any way.&#xD;
Oh! Kate glories in such things. Nothing&#xD;
delights her more than to join my father in his&#xD;
dangerous expeditions ; and had she been here&#xD;
to-day, she would have been the first across that&#xD;
river," said Annie, her dark 'eyes kindling with&#xD;
enthusiasm as she spoke of the daring nature of&#xD;
her pet sister.&#xD;
"And do you never go out with your father ?"&#xD;
"Never, Sir, without he has need of both of&#xD;
us for some purpose-to carry an order or the&#xD;
like of that! I am more of the quiet and home&#xD;
nature of my dear mother, and do not love peril&#xD;
and excitement."&#xD;
"There speaks the true woman's soul," said&#xD;
Beverly, thinking that he had struck the vein.&#xD;
And he at once dashed off into a hyperbole&#xD;
upon the nature of home, quiet, and luxury.&#xD;
Annie was now really listening to him, and if&#xD;
he had looked very closely, he would have seen&#xD;
a quiet little smile gathering upon her face,&#xD;
which had in it more of contempt than admira-&#xD;
tion. He was overdoing the-thing. For Annie&#xD;
Stuart had more good strong sense than he gave&#xD;
her credit for. She was not, it is true, a Di&#xD;
Vernon, neither was she an Ophelia, likely to&#xD;
go moon-struck or mad under any feelings&#xD;
which he could arouse. *&#xD;

"Are you fond of music, Miss Stuart ?" he&#xD;
asked, as an opening for another point of attack.&#xD;
"Some kinds," she said, quietly. "There, I&#xD;
like that exceedingly ! Do you not think it su-&#xD;
perb? There is both tone and compass for you."&#xD;
And Annie burst out laughing while a huge&#xD;
old wench, who had been out getting some&#xD;
vegetables for the kitchen use, passed by them,&#xD;
singing an old negro refrain at the very top of&#xD;
her voice. The words, like the music, were suit-&#xD;
able to the singer, and anything but romantic;&#xD;
and Beverly now saw plainly that Annie, sus-&#xD;
eeptible as she might be to true romance, was&#xD;
no mere child for a fop to fool with.&#xD;
So he affected to be highly taken with her&#xD;
appreciation of the ludicrous, and laughed&#xD;
heartily at the music which she praised, though&#xD;
inwardly he was chagrined at the apparent im-&#xD;
possibilty of making himself interesting to the&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
A new thought struck him. He would try&#xD;
another vein, oue which he had seldom known&#xD;
to fail, especially with ladies who dwelt inland&#xD;
end read poetry.&#xD;
"Have you ever seen the ocean, Miss An-&#xD;
nie P" he asked.&#xD;
"N o, Sir; though I have read much about it,&#xD;
and thought more."&#xD;
"I am a child of the ocean, Miss Annie."&#xD;
"You, Sir?&#xD;
"Yes-as Byron says:&#xD;
"My home is on the dark blue sea,&#xD;
My thoughts as boundless, and my heart as free."&#xD;
"You are lucky, Sir. Why did you not stay&#xD;
with your Mother Ocean, instead of coming in&#xD;
hire among our mountains and swamps."&#xD;
"because, most fair and witty lady, variety&#xD;
is the spice of life which gives it all its flavor."&#xD;
"So I used to read in one of my schoolbooks.&#xD;
You must have gone to school once, to judge&#xD;
from the source of your quotation."&#xD;
"L believe I am at school now," he said,_with&#xD;
some confusion.  "Are all the young ladies&#xD;
around here as smart as you and your pretty&#xD;
sister "&#xD;
"Smarter in some things. For instance, they&#xD;
are good at recruiting--persuading strong,&#xD;
healthy, likely-looking young gentlemen like&#xD;
yourself to enter into the service of the Confed-&#xD;
erate States, where they can win more honor and&#xD;
do more good than they can by praising beauty&#xD;
which would rather be defended than flattered."&#xD;
"Lady, you cannot accuse me of being back-&#xD;
wardin the cause. I already have a commis-&#xD;
sion in the Cpnfederate Navy."&#xD;
"Then, why, Sir, are you here? Have I not&#xD;
beard already that vessels are fitting out tQ skim&#xD;
th- ocean, and to show the audacious Yankees&#xD;
of the North that the South has its rights upon&#xD;
the sea as well as the land ?"&#xD;
"\ was on the eve of departure for service&#xD;
when my cousin asked my assistance to regain&#xD;
his property."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And will you, Sir, let an affair of a prifa,&#xD;
nature take you away from a public duty? Alas&#xD;
Sir! if all the sons of the South thus enter cold.&#xD;
ly into the contest at the onset, alas for the&#xD;
hopes of independence which we have formed,&#xD;
Look at my noble father! Not one night in&#xD;
twenty does his head press a pillow. His money&#xD;
his life, even us, his loved children, he has thrown&#xD;
into the treasury of his country's necessities;&#xD;
and, Sir, all-all will go without a murmur, be-&#xD;
fore he will draw back- one inch from the step&#xD;
he was one of the first to take. And he will rise&#xD;
and we will triumph, and then-then-"&#xD;
She paused, seemed to think she was going&#xD;
too far in her enthusiasm before a stranger, and&#xD;
did not finish the remark she had commenced.&#xD;
"Then what? Do not pause in your eloquent&#xD;
remarks, fair lady?"&#xD;
"I should only have added, Sir, that those&#xD;
who neglect their country in her hour of need&#xD;
will not be forgotten in her hour of triumph.&#xD;
For upon a scroll of infamy, blacker than the&#xD;
shades of night, will their names be recorded as&#xD;
'a proof of shame forever."&#xD;
"I hope, lady, that my name will not be found&#xD;
on such a scroll."&#xD;
"And I also hope so, Sir. I may be too earnest,&#xD;
almost unwomanly, in my anxiety for the South;&#xD;
but I know the fearful nature of the contest&#xD;
which we have initiated. With no treasury, ar-&#xD;
mies yet to form and discipline, a new govern*&#xD;
ment has to struggle with an old one.".&#xD;
"You forget, lady, that our Government is&#xD;
made up of statesmen who have borne leading&#xD;
parts in the affair s of the united nation for many&#xD;
years. They do not lack experience."&#xD;
"No, but they lack power and the unity which&#xD;
gives power."&#xD;
"Miss Stuart, I little expected to find so much&#xD;
thought in one so young, and of that sex which&#xD;
is supposed to think more of dress and adorn-&#xD;
ment, and of seeking means to attract admira-&#xD;
tion, than anything else."&#xD;
"Supposed so by men who look for nothing&#xD;
more than beauty or amusement in women!"&#xD;
said Annie, almost contemptuously. "If you&#xD;
read the history of the women of the Revolution,&#xD;
you will see, Sir, that in those days they were&#xD;
found of value to the patriot's heart and arm.&#xD;
But I do not wish to speak in praise of our sex'&#xD;
I fear you will have a dull day before you."&#xD;
"Not if I have you to converse with, lady."&#xD;
"You need not' pay me any more compli-&#xD;
ments, Sir. They fall upon barren ground.  I&#xD;
have to assist my mother in her daily duties. If&#xD;
you wish to hunt or fish, you will find a fowling.&#xD;
piece or fishing-tackle in'the armory. rlo ride,&#xD;
you oan saddle yourself a horse in the stable.&#xD;
Or if to read, there are plenty of books and mag-&#xD;
azines in the next room on the right of the par.&#xD;
lor, which father uses both as a business-room&#xD;
and a library."&#xD;
"I thank you, Miss Annie. I shall avail my.&#xD;
&#xD;
self of your kindness in some way, and I pray&#xD;
you not to take serious notice of my foolish lit-&#xD;
tle nonsensicalities, in the way of compliments.&#xD;
They come from my lips, often, cre I think them.&#xD;
But I know, when I assure you that I deeply re-&#xD;
spect your exalted sense of duty, that you will&#xD;
accord inc the justice of believing what I say."&#xD;
"I will; and I hope, Sir, to hear that you are&#xD;
moving forward in the path of duty."&#xD;
"It is well for us of the South that Northern&#xD;
women are :not so urgent upon their men to&#xD;
spring to arms, or we would be crushed out by&#xD;
numbers before we could arm ourselves."&#xD;
"Our only hope is in their delay, in their&#xD;
coldness. If I read them aright, they are a cold&#xD;
and passionless people, who require to be struck&#xD;
more than once before tl.ey fairly wake up and&#xD;
get mad. But when they are aroused, their an-&#xD;
ger will not subside easily. But you must ex-&#xD;
cuse me, Mr. Beverly. I must go and assist my&#xD;
mother.   Make yourself at home; it is likely&#xD;
that father and your friends will return shortly&#xD;
after nightfall. If you should go out, remember&#xD;
that we dine at two."&#xD;
"What a superb girl !" said Beverly to him-&#xD;
self, as she left his side.  "She is worth ten of&#xD;
her mad-cap sister. If she had Sadia's- But&#xD;
no ! Ill think of no one but Sadia ; for Pd have&#xD;
her now, if I knew that Satan would get my soul&#xD;
for it."&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
' It was after ten o'clock at night'when Captain&#xD;
Stuart returned, with de Montfort and his party,&#xD;
having, as usual, been completely successful in&#xD;
his foray. Forty good horses, and'the arms and&#xD;
equipments of seven men, who had intended to&#xD;
escort them to the Government depot, was the&#xD;
result of the expedition. It was as old Michel&#xD;
gleefully remarked&#xD;
"One ver good speculacione."&#xD;
One of the drst questions which the Captain&#xD;
asked upon entering the house, was:&#xD;
"Has Kate returned yet?"&#xD;
To which his other daughter replied:&#xD;
"No, dear father. It is hardly time, without&#xD;
she left the city very early."&#xD;
"True, darling. My impatience takes no note&#xD;
of time lately. Hurry up supper for our guests&#xD;
We are a hungry lot of beggars, for we've taken&#xD;
nothing solid since we left here in the morn&#xD;
"Supper is ready now, father. We only wai&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
"Then ring the bell. We are as ready as we&#xD;
ever shall be, I reckon."&#xD;
The ball soon gathered all hands into th&#xD;
main dining-room, where a smoking supper-ta&#xD;
ble, furnished as only Virginia tables in earlier&#xD;
days could be furnished, put them in splendid&#xD;
humor.&#xD;
Alas for Virginia now! her days of prince&#xD;
luxury are forever past-crushed out by th&#xD;
&#xD;
treason of her own children, who, led into folly&#xD;
by the fire.fien of Carolina, are too proud to&#xD;
acknowledge t ei error, but persist in their&#xD;
own surely-coming destruction. N ever were&#xD;
suicides more cool and desperate in their deter,&#xD;
mined self-destruction than the sons of Southern&#xD;
and Eastern Virginia. But I forget I am telling&#xD;
a story-not writing h  'ies upon rebellion.&#xD;
"How have you passed your day, Mr. Bever-&#xD;
ly"?" asked his host.&#xD;
"Agreeably, Sir. How else could I?  Your&#xD;
library at my disposal, I made use of it. . After&#xD;
dinner, seeing that a few brace of wild ducks&#xD;
were dodging around the river-bank, I borrow-&#xD;
ed one of your guns, and I believe a half-dozen&#xD;
of them are now before you. You see, I have&#xD;
not been altogether idle. How could I, when&#xD;
your own good lady and daughter were busied&#xD;
all the time in preparing for your comfort&#xD;
against your return ?"&#xD;
Beverly had glanced at the face of Annie, who&#xD;
was pouring .out tea when her father asked the&#xD;
question, and the ungenerous thought that he&#xD;
had of answering that he had been listening to&#xD;
lectures on patriotism from her, passed from&#xD;
him in a moment.&#xD;
"Your services have been less fatiguing&#xD;
than ours, but by hungry men, will be appre-&#xD;
ciated," said the Captain, as he set to carving&#xD;
some of the ducks for his guests.&#xD;
The latter did not need any especial urging&#xD;
to make them fall to. They " went into" he&#xD;
edibles in the most complimentary manner--&#xD;
that is, complimentary to the getters up of so&#xD;
good a supper.&#xD;
After the guests' appetites were satisfied,&#xD;
they mostly adjourned to the lawn in front of&#xD;
the house to smoke, or, lighting their pipes, took&#xD;
seats on the piazza and discussed polities, the&#xD;
incidents of the R7~ebellion, and such other maid.&#xD;
ters of interest as came into their minds.&#xD;
But one there was who seemed in little hu&#xD;
mor for discussions or any kind of conversation.&#xD;
He paced to and fro upon his piazza hurriedly,&#xD;
often pausing when he arrived at its southern&#xD;
end, and gazing down the road which led toward&#xD;
Alexandria.&#xD;
The guerrilla looked for the  iide and the&#xD;
darling of his heart. It was time that she was&#xD;
Sbank.&#xD;
bAt lat, his impatience became such he order-&#xD;
ed his favorite horse out; and he was just on the&#xD;
t point of mounting to go to meet her, when the&#xD;
gallant girl arrived. &#xD;
e The white foam flecks that flew from the&#xD;
mouth of the jet black steed, its smoking sides,&#xD;
e told how rapidly she had come, and how much&#xD;
e she had tried to lessen the time which anxiety&#xD;
r had made miserable to him.&#xD;
d "I am glad you have come, darling !" said&#xD;
her father, as he lifted Kate from the saddle&#xD;
y with his strong arms. "1 was about going out&#xD;
&#xD;

"I came as quickly as I could, father. I was&#xD;
detained in the city until late. But Iwill tell&#xD;
you all when we are alone. Let me go in and&#xD;
get, a glass of water ; I feel faint and tired. I&#xD;
have hal lnu rest since I left here."&#xD;
Poor girl, I otertask your strength, I know&#xD;
I do, but I have no one else to help me that ~I&#xD;
can depend on."&#xD;
1 know it, father, and do not shrink from&#xD;
auvtiiir.g that I can do for you."&#xD;
Biess you girl; go in and take a glass of&#xD;
wine, and theu come to me in my own room,&#xD;
and tell fiC the result of your visit."&#xD;
"Yes, father.  I saw an old friend of yours,&#xD;
father, n  Washington.  lie little thought&#xD;
hose daughter he was making love to."&#xD;
' Who was it child?"&#xD;
"t he lieut enant of cavalry whom you so near-&#xD;
ly captured at Fairfax Court-IIoube, and had&#xD;
another brush With at the Cross Roads."&#xD;
\ Weli, he is a gallant fellow, if he is a Fed.&#xD;
Nothing but his very daring saved him, or his&#xD;
Ien. A sluw-goer w ould have been ridden down&#xD;
before he could have formed to meet my charge.&#xD;
But go in, child; I will have your horse put&#xD;
away-Le needs care."&#xD;
CIIAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
When Warburton de Montfort saw sate&#xD;
Stuart arrive, he instantly called Michel and&#xD;
Beverly together, and they went to their pri-&#xD;
vate room to await the report which they cx-&#xD;
peeted to hear from Washington. They were&#xD;
hot detained there long in anxiety.&#xD;
Captain Stuart, after a brief interview with&#xD;
his daughter, entered the room and said&#xD;
"Gemtlemeu, your game has not yet arriveA&#xD;
at head-quarters.  No trace can be found&#xD;
or word heard of Miss Sadia de Montfort or her&#xD;
,aity in Washington, though parties of fugi-&#xD;
tives aie ir1ILg there daily."&#xD;
"'Then where on earti can she be' said the&#xD;
brother, pale with disappointment.&#xD;
"Either 3et hidden Eomewhere on the i'iver,&#xD;
oi- else she ha.3 from the start taken some other&#xD;
track, throwing you upon a false scent," said&#xD;
Stuart.  "My daughter has made the most&#xD;
careful inquiry, and the sources of her infor-&#xD;
maation are such that nothing could ti anspire&#xD;
of an official nature without her learning it.&#xD;
You may judge of her facilities when I tell you&#xD;
that at four o'clock she heard of our capture of&#xD;
horses.  You know it was only two when they&#xD;
were taken, and it was an .hour's ride to the&#xD;
nearest telegraph station, where those who&#xD;
telegraph to Washington for help which they&#xD;
will riot get, went to."&#xD;
"When our errand here is over and empty-&#xD;
banded, we will have to sneak back to Spring-&#xD;
land. With one nigger left, I could plant on a&#xD;
large scale if I biadn't other work on hand," said&#xD;
Warburton, bitterly.&#xD;
"Despondency is a poor eure for evil. You&#xD;
&#xD;
will never regain your property by giving tip."&#xD;
"I have little hopes of it now,'' said War-&#xD;
burton, gloomily."&#xD;
Polh, man, before the year is out you may&#xD;
have the power to demand full reparation from&#xD;
tle hands of the Federal Governmient, if that&#xD;
Government then exists, for every loss you&#xD;
have sustained. WVhen they see the allies which&#xD;
I look for showing their handl, the Yankees&#xD;
will not talk quite so confidently of crushing&#xD;
what they are pleased to term a rebellion.&#xD;
When Eugland and France, who cannot do&#xD;
without our cotton, come to our aid with money,&#xD;
arms, ships, and recognition of our rights as an&#xD;
independent nationality, thou you can hold&#xD;
your head up, and if you can't find yonr nig-&#xD;
gers, claim and get the worth of them."&#xD;
"Yes, when that when arrives.  But I have&#xD;
no faith in these allies. They will not aid us&#xD;
until we are beyond the need of aid, one way or&#xD;
the other."&#xD;
"Poh, you are in error. Do you think our&#xD;
leaders have so little sagacity that they would&#xD;
have risked the bold step they have taken with-&#xD;
out the surity of material help from abroad?&#xD;
No Sir ! Nearly two years ago it was promised&#xD;
officially, and in no less a place than the City&#xD;
of Washington. I was l)resent, so was Letcher,&#xD;
Wise, Pryor, as well as Davis and Mallory. I&#xD;
can name others.   And not one man of them&#xD;
would have come out boldly in this latter witl&#xD;
out a guarnaterof foreign aid. Whiatcould the&#xD;
old Union have done in the Revolution but for&#xD;
the aid of France ?"&#xD;
" Oui ! answer you zat, shentlemens," said&#xD;
Michel, triumphantly. " When France shake&#xD;
hands wiz you, all will be well. But dam ze Ros&#xD;
Bifs, darn ze diable Anglaise ! Iiio like zem--&#xD;
no nevare ! Zey murdare ze old Napoleon, zey&#xD;
play wiz Louis like one cat play wiz a mouse,&#xD;
only to put him undare by-and by. Sacre&#xD;
blku-damn ze Rlos Bife !"&#xD;
"I do not feel much like discussing politics.&#xD;
The game of Secession is open. I shall take a&#xD;
full hand in it, win or lose," said WYirburton,&#xD;
If I bear no more of the abactees when I&#xD;
get back to Springland, I shall sell all my stock,&#xD;
close up everything, and L t the place care for&#xD;
itself till the war is over. If I live through&#xD;
that, I wil be able t- re-stock it then."&#xD;
"Spoken most sensibly, Montfort. And now,&#xD;
if you intend making an early homeward start,&#xD;
I will leave you-to your rest. I will have the&#xD;
river watched just as closely as before, and if I&#xD;
fall upon the least trace of the fugitives, you&#xD;
shall hear of it."&#xD;
"Both thanks and pecuniary recompense&#xD;
will be yours."&#xD;
"I can dispense with both when I serve a&#xD;
friend," said Stuart, quietly. "I wish you a&#xD;
good-night. I shall be astir before dawn, and&#xD;
will have your animals fed, ready for a start,. and&#xD;
your.own breakfast ready. I want the horses&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
It is so long since we have glanced back to&#xD;
our heroine and her lonesome camp that the&#xD;
reader may think we have forgotten her. Far&#xD;
from it; but if we keep not an eye upon all of&#xD;
the actors in this drama of real life, its claim&#xD;
may be imperfect, and not hold the minds of all&#xD;
who read, as we desire.&#xD;
Over a week had elapsed after the fearful&#xD;
storm which was described in the tenth chapter,&#xD;
and yet old Hunter and Napoleon, both keeping&#xD;
is turn vigilant watch, failed to discover any&#xD;
sign of the return of the searching party who&#xD;
had gone down the river.&#xD;
And of all the party in camp, but one seemed&#xD;
to regard their delay with painful anxiety. Of&#xD;
course, that one was Sadia. For she felt that&#xD;
for her and those with her there was no real&#xD;
safety except under the bright folds of the&#xD;
national flag, and where Rebelion had no pow-&#xD;
er.&#xD;
But those with her, all negroes except Hun-&#xD;
ter and her brother and sister, released sudden-&#xD;
ly from all labor except hunting and fishing,&#xD;
and the procuring of fuel sufficient to cook&#xD;
their food by, thought themselves in a perfect&#xD;
paradise. They had plenty of excellent food,&#xD;
plenty of time to sing, sleep, or dance away&#xD;
care, and their natures, almost animal, required&#xD;
nothing more on earth. Like most of their&#xD;
class, they had no thought of the morrow, and&#xD;
being safe and undisturbed for so many days,&#xD;
they had forgotten all fear of pursuit, all thought&#xD;
of danger.&#xD;
Not so Sadia. The longer their stay, the&#xD;
more anxious her heart, the more sleepless her&#xD;
eyes. Her old nurse in vain tried to cook deli-&#xD;
cacies which would tempt her appetite ; and&#xD;
the next time old Hunter came up from the riv-&#xD;
er-side, she called him apart, and told him, in&#xD;
tears :                                   -&#xD;
" Sumfin' must be done for dat poor chile, or&#xD;
ehe'1l sure be done gone. She don't eat nuffin',&#xD;
Sah -nuffin' at all."&#xD;
"I know she frets ; poor lady, I will try to&#xD;
comfort her," said the good old man.&#xD;
And he went to Sadia, ani asked her to walk&#xD;
with him a little way, apart from the bearing of&#xD;
the others.&#xD;
Sadia went more cheerfully than usual, and&#xD;
her first question, after they were alone, ac-&#xD;
counte. for it.&#xD;
"Have you brought me news which will jus-&#xD;
tify our starting down the river once more ?"&#xD;
sl asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Alas, dear lady, I have no news. Either I&#xD;
or Napoleon have been constantly on the watch,&#xD;
but we have neither seen or heard any ascend-&#xD;
ing party -seen nothing but an occasional&#xD;
scouting party over on the other side of the&#xD;
river. This side is so swampy that, they never&#xD;
are seen there. But you are fretting yourself&#xD;
to death, Miss Sadia. Your cook says you&#xD;
neither eat nor sleep !"&#xD;
"I cannot help it, Mr. Hunter. I know and&#xD;
feel our peril, and that delay only increases it."&#xD;
"And yet, dear Miss Sadia, how can we, with-&#xD;
out serious danger, yet leave a place where' we&#xD;
at least find present security? They must be&#xD;
on the river yet."&#xD;
"I do not think so."&#xD;
"Why, Miss Sadia, they could not well have&#xD;
passed up unobserved."&#xD;
"I do not think they ever will pass up in&#xD;
boats, Mr. Hunter. The value of the boats&#xD;
would not be worth the toil of rowing them up&#xD;
against the swift current, if they have gone very&#xD;
far down in search' of us, and they have un-&#xD;
doubtedly gone as far as they could without&#xD;
coming in contact with the Federal force near&#xD;
Washington."&#xD;
"Strange that I should not have thought of&#xD;
that," said the old fisherman, musingly. "And&#xD;
I believe you are more than half right, Miss Sa-&#xD;
dia," he continued. "Come to think of it, if I&#xD;
was the captain of a searching party like them,&#xD;
I think myself, if I failed in finding what I was&#xD;
after on the river, I'd divide my party below,&#xD;
and come up by land both sides, to see if I&#xD;
couldn't strike the trail somewhere. - Like a&amp;amp;&#xD;
not they have done this, and maybe they are&#xD;
back at Springland before this time. If we only&#xD;
knew that they were, the sooner that we get&#xD;
away from here the better."&#xD;
"How can we possibly find out ?"&#xD;
"In no way, without I go there. I shouldn't&#xD;
dare -to trust any of the black folks. If they&#xD;
were caught, they would be forced to tell where&#xD;
they left us."&#xD;
" Yes ; too true. And you must not go, my&#xD;
friend. I would sooner risk all in a passage&#xD;
down the river. If we cannot pass unimpeded,&#xD;
we can fight our way through, perhaps."&#xD;
",If all our force was made up of white men,&#xD;
it wouldn't be so risky," said Hunter, thought-&#xD;
fully. "And as it is, I don't see as we can bet-&#xD;
ter ourselves. I am getting tired of delay my-&#xD;
self. I want to see my old General, and take a&#xD;
hand in this new war, if it has got to come to&#xD;
that."&#xD;
-" Do risk it, Mr.Iunter-do! I would rath-&#xD;
er meet danger boldly at once than live in con-&#xD;
tinual terror of it," said Sadia, earnestly.&#xD;
"Well, lady, your wish shall be gratified&#xD;
very soon. I will see at once to the state of&#xD;
our provisions, and be ready. The first dark&#xD;
night, with the wind blowing down atream,shall&#xD;
be the night of our trial."&#xD;

the young lady brightened with the new hope&#xD;
before her.&#xD;
And she, with a lighter step and a far brighter&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
Supplied with horses by their late successful&#xD;
forav on the Maryland side, Warbrrton de Mont-&#xD;
fort and his party were all ready for a borne.&#xD;
ward start, on the morning after Kate Stuart's&#xD;
return from her visit to Washington ; and tak-&#xD;
ing an early breakfast, they made preparations&#xD;
for an early start.&#xD;
I wish we could prevail upon you to go with&#xD;
us to our section," said Warburton to Captain&#xD;
Stuart, as the latter aided'in fitting out the&#xD;
party with bridles and saddles. "It might be&#xD;
beneficial to you, and I know it would be to&#xD;
us." -&#xD;
"flow so?" asked the Captain.&#xD;
"For us, because you know all the roads,&#xD;
and could show us the shortest route. For you,&#xD;
because I could readily raise you a hundred or&#xD;
more good men for your inew command."&#xD;
"The last is a good reason, if I could only be&#xD;
assured of the meu," said Stuart, quietly. " As&#xD;
to the route, you cannot easily lose your way if&#xD;
vou follow the river-road up. But the men.&#xD;
Do you think I could recruit a hundred or so of&#xD;
good light cavalry ?"&#xD;
"Yes; I feel so confident that I will con-&#xD;
tribute five thousand dollars to aid in fitting out&#xD;
your regiment, if you fail to recruit the number&#xD;
in three days after you have arrived in our sec.&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"You strongly tempt me !" said Stuart, pon-&#xD;
dering for a moment. Then he added: "I&#xD;
will risk the trial and go with you. I can leave&#xD;
matters here for a few days, for I have brave&#xD;
hearts and watchful eyes about my home! You&#xD;
seed not delay your departure ; it will not take&#xD;
&#xD;
me five minuces to get ready. You and your&#xD;
party can move on by the river-road, and I will&#xD;
soon overtake you."&#xD;
"A thousand thanks, my noble Captain! It&#xD;
is even possible, that with your keen, scouting&#xD;
knowledge, we may vet get on the trail of my&#xD;
niggers."&#xD;
"I can scent a Yankee further than I can a&#xD;
nigger !" said the Captain, with a laugh ; and&#xD;
he turned and entered the house, to prepare for&#xD;
his journey.&#xD;
\Warburton, having now mounted, took the&#xD;
advance of his party, Beverly riding upon hi's&#xD;
left, and Carl Michel upon his right.&#xD;
I have good news!" said Warburton, as&#xD;
they rode away at a moderate pace.&#xD;
"Eh? Bon? Suppose you explain, Mea.&#xD;
sieur ?" said Michel, quickly.&#xD;
"Captain Stuart is going to Springland with&#xD;
us !'&#xD;
"Eh? Zat is grand intelligence  Capitaine&#xD;
Stuart is so good as twenty men. I shall feel&#xD;
more glad zan before ; but, sacred, I was nevare&#xD;
made wiz my short legs for to ride upon ze&#xD;
horse. I shall make myself very much fatigue&#xD;
in a very little time. Will de brave Capitai-e&#xD;
come wiz us very soon 1"&#xD;
"Yes; he told me to ride on and he would&#xD;
very soon overtake us&#xD;
" Eh bien ! Do not let us ride too much&#xD;
quick. Zis horse, when he go up and down, in&#xD;
what you call ze trot, shake my stomach intol-&#xD;
erable! Mon Dicul if zis ride continue for very&#xD;
long time, I shall be medicine ready for ze devil&#xD;
-well shaken before taken !"&#xD;
Michels companions could not but laugh at&#xD;
his droll idea, and while they were laughing&#xD;
heartily Captain Stuart rode up.&#xD;
" Ah, mon cher Capitaine, zey laugh at me !"&#xD;
said Michel, half inclined to be angry, half in-&#xD;
clined to laugh himself. " I 'ave merely explain&#xD;
to zem my grand misery upon zis doable horse,&#xD;
and zey sink zat it is very lunny! By dam, to&#xD;
zem it may be very funny, but to rue it is ze&#xD;
ozzer way ! It is almost 's bad as ze crucify&#xD;
zat my Iriend, Messicur 4oopcnay, of Phil-&#xD;
delpli, used to speak about some time. I like&#xD;
not ze trot, Capitaine, I like not ze trot !"&#xD;
" Then let us gallop. That pace is as easy&#xD;
as a cradle !" said Stuart, with a laugh, as he&#xD;
touched his coal-black steed with the spur.&#xD;
The horse of Michel, which did not lack&#xD;
spirit, bounded forward by the side of the Cap-&#xD;
tain, and the whole cavalcade in a moment was&#xD;
in a swift but easy gallop.&#xD;
You like this better, do you not ?" Stuart&#xD;
asked of Michel, as the pace became smooth and&#xD;
regular.&#xD;
" Ouil Zis is much improve upon ze trot.&#xD;
But better I like ze cradel of ze sea zan ze&#xD;
cradel of ze horse, Capitane !"&#xD;
"I fear you will never make a cavalryman,&#xD;

checking his horse down after a gallop of a mile&#xD;
or two.&#xD;
' Ah, bon! Zis is ze pace zat is most agree-&#xD;
able !" said Mich 1, with a sigh of gratification.&#xD;
"how long will at take us to reach Spring-&#xD;
land ?" asked Warburton of Stuart, riding up&#xD;
beside'h in.&#xD;
"If we use our spurs judiciously, and our&#xD;
horses have good bottom, we will easily be&#xD;
there a little after noon to-morrow," said Stuart.&#xD;
"We will be two-thirds of the way where I pro-&#xD;
pose to stop fur the night."&#xD;
"Our horses may 'ave ze bottom ; but, by&#xD;
dam, I doubt very much if I 'ave any of ze bot-&#xD;
tom left when I get zare !" groaned poor Michel,&#xD;
with a woful face.&#xD;
But he rode on, nevertheless, side by side&#xD;
with Stuart, and when the bill was passed, man-&#xD;
fully joined in the renewed gallop of the party.&#xD;
CIIAPTER XXI.&#xD;
Thomas IIuntcr was no laggard when his&#xD;
mind was made up, and he at once set to work.&#xD;
Observing that clouds were indeed overspread&#xD;
ing the sky, as Sadia had already noticed, and&#xD;
that a rainstorm., was surely coming on, he&#xD;
hurried his preparations for departure, for he&#xD;
well knew that there would be little watch kept&#xD;
on the river in a stormy night.&#xD;
"We shall have a hard night of it, Miss&#xD;
Sadia !" he said to our heroine, when she in-&#xD;
sisted upon his joining her at a late dinner.&#xD;
"But if you and the children are well wrapped&#xD;
and covered up, you will not suffer much, and&#xD;
we will be far more safe on the river in a rainy&#xD;
night, for it takes more patriotism than Rebels&#xD;
have to keep a strict picket-watch in a drench-&#xD;
ing rainstorm.&#xD;
"I shall not heed any personal inconvenience,&#xD;
my good friend," said Sadia, with a smile, "if&#xD;
our journey can be prosecuted safely. My little&#xD;
brother and sister can be shielded from the&#xD;
storm, for I did not forget your advice to bring&#xD;
plenty of warm clothing for them."&#xD;
"That is all right. We will move down the&#xD;
bayou before dark, so as to get out on the river&#xD;
at the earliest possible minoent 1" said hunter.&#xD;
"We have provisions enough, have we not ?"&#xD;
"Yes, lady-more than enough. And the&#xD;
niggers have brought too much luggage. I&#xD;
shall leave everything except what is actually&#xD;
needed, so as to lighten the boats, and make&#xD;
them more speedy !"&#xD;
"Do what you think best, my friend? I rely&#xD;
fully upon your judgment and courage F'&#xD;
"Thank yan, Miss Sadia. I'm an old stick, it&#xD;
&#xD;
is true ; but yet I am tough, and do not forget&#xD;
the days when I was something, and knew what&#xD;
service was and could do it. If I only meet&#xD;
my old General, and he remembers me, I will&#xD;
show that there's life left in me yet. I hardly&#xD;
think he will have forgotten me. how well I&#xD;
remember the charge he led at Lundy's Lane.&#xD;
He was young, and I was but a boy ; but it was&#xD;
gioriou3 work.  The red-coats, veterans  of&#xD;
many a field abroad, held us in scorn at first;&#xD;
they said we knew nothing about cold steel, but&#xD;
that day they found the Anierican bayonet too&#xD;
much for British valor. They ran in the lane,&#xD;
and Captain Miller drove them like flying sheep&#xD;
from the battery on the hill, and the victory&#xD;
was ours. Scott was down, but God saved him&#xD;
for other-days and more glory !"&#xD;
Sahia looked with wondering eyes upon the&#xD;
change which the enthusiasm of last glorious&#xD;
memories made in the old man's appearance.&#xD;
His eyes flashed withi all the fire of } outh-his&#xD;
very form seemed to dilate-his face flushed,&#xD;
and his voice was full and powerful.&#xD;
"I hope you will soon see your old General,&#xD;
for, once where be is, we will all be in safety !"&#xD;
said Sadia.&#xD;
"You may be sure of that. Now, eat hearti-&#xD;
ly, lady, and do not refuse at. least two good&#xD;
glasses of wine to strengthen you for the voyage&#xD;
to-night!" replied Hunter. "And as I took a&#xD;
hearty bunch a little while ago, you will now&#xD;
let me go to get the boats ready, I know, for&#xD;
m.y appetite is fully satisfied !" he added.&#xD;
Sadia could not refuse her assent, for her&#xD;
anxiety to leave and be on the way was so great&#xD;
.that she could scarcely keep her promise of&#xD;
making a hearty meal.&#xD;
lunter at once set to work in preparing the&#xD;
boats for the party, only allowing the colored&#xD;
people to put in such things as were actually&#xD;
necessary for the trip, and provisions enough&#xD;
to last them for the three days, or rather nights,&#xD;
in which he hoped to make the passage.&#xD;
This-done, and the people all having partaken&#xD;
of a hearty meal, he got them into the boats,&#xD;
and himself taking charge of the leading boat,&#xD;
in which Sadia and her young charges were seat-&#xD;
ed, he pushed off, followed by the rest.&#xD;
Long before they had got out of the bayou,&#xD;
the threatened rainstorm cane on, not very&#xD;
heavily, but in a drizzling way, which was any-&#xD;
thing but comfortable.&#xD;
It was dark when the boats reached the river,&#xD;
and took in Napoleon and the man who watched&#xD;
with him ; and when hunter turned his boat's&#xD;
head down-stream, the share could not be see n&#xD;
at ten yards distance. lie had fastened the&#xD;
painter of each of the boats behind hin to the&#xD;
stern of the next, to avoid separation. and a&#xD;
confusion which would create noise. le kept&#xD;
his course by the sound of the lippies breaking&#xD;
against the shore, urging all of the crews to&#xD;
make as much speed as possible, for the further&#xD;

&#xD;
they got in such a favorable night, the better&#xD;
for them,&#xD;
Sadia did not heed the pelting of the storm;&#xD;
and as the wind, coming from astern, aided their&#xD;
progress, she did not regret that it blew abuost&#xD;
a gale. Sh was regardless of the discomforts&#xD;
which added to her safety the more. For few&#xD;
persons would voluntarily choose to be abroad&#xD;
on such a night, unless kept there by dire neces-&#xD;
sity, or the stern and despotic rules of military&#xD;
discipline, which but too often amounts to&#xD;
tyranny, especially where men raised from the&#xD;
lower ra m:s cf life, by chicanery or cunning,&#xD;
reach high ofical positions. Brave men and&#xD;
genteicen never become tyrants - our best&#xD;

they hold over.&#xD;
W ith this dliressive remark, we will leave our&#xD;
part) for a while upon the river.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
The party, under the guidance of Captain&#xD;
Stuart, did not have a very pleasant evening to&#xD;
close their first day's ride with, and the storms&#xD;
which so favored our fugitive friends on the&#xD;
river, became to them-I mean Stuart and his&#xD;
party--so serious an impediment in the way of&#xD;
darkness and sofLe.ing the road, that he did not&#xD;
reach the poit he intended on the start, but&#xD;
was forced to stop twenty miles short of it.&#xD;
But the storm, like most spring "spells of&#xD;
weather", was only transient, and the sun of the&#xD;
next morning was not an hour high when the&#xD;
shame-faced clouds broke away from before it,&#xD;
and the day came out as smiling as-as-let me&#xD;
think-well, a pretty women going out shop-&#xD;
ping with a full purse in her pocket. I can't'&#xD;
find a more appropriate simile for a lovely&#xD;
spring day, that I know of.&#xD;
But though all was bright above, the heavy&#xD;
rain of the night had given the roads the usual&#xD;
Virginia mud consistency, which one must get&#xD;
stuck in a few times to be enabled to tho.rough-&#xD;
ly appreciate.  It " sticketh closer than a&#xD;
brother", and is as heavy as-the sins of a cop-&#xD;
perhead!&#xD;
Therefore the progress of the land party was&#xD;
slow, and it was late in the afternoon when&#xD;
Stuart and War"ur ton's party rode by the spot&#xD;
on the opposiLe side of the river from which&#xD;
Sadia ha i moved only the night before.&#xD;
"Were you particular in looking in, over in&#xD;
the lagoons yonder, when you came down the&#xD;
river y ' as:ed Stuart of Warburton, who rode&#xD;
on his right sade.&#xD;
" Over there ?" replied the young planter.&#xD;
" I dnd not hnow there were any lagoons there,&#xD;
and we made no search beyond the shore, where&#xD;
we saw no signs!" -&#xD;
" The rare lagoons in there, somewhere.&#xD;
Old hunters have described them to iIe. And&#xD;
when old Tom hunter was at my place, he told&#xD;
me hehad been camping out and hunting some-&#xD;
&#xD;
where along here for a considerable time. I'm&#xD;
afraid your search along the river has been very&#xD;
superficial. I should not wonder at all if a man&#xD;
of old Hunter's cunning had piloted the party in&#xD;
there somewhere, where, fish and ganN plenty,&#xD;
he could hide until he thought you 1i l given&#xD;
up all search for them?"&#xD;
"By Jupiter, you may be right.     If you&#xD;
know the locality, let us halt and get boats, and&#xD;
go over there !"&#xD;
"It is too late to do it to-night-a storm is&#xD;
threatening besides. We stall have to halt at&#xD;
a tavern a mile or so ahead, and if we can get&#xD;
boats there, we can take a look across in the&#xD;
morning ! That cursed stor~mi last night Eas&#xD;
made the roads so heavy that our horses are&#xD;
pretty much fagged out, and a rest will do them&#xD;
no hurt' '&#xD;
"'Well, you are guide-we leave everything&#xD;
to you, Captain !"&#xD;
Only one mile more, eh, Captaine ?" said&#xD;
Michel, who rode on the o'her side.&#xD;
That is all to-night, Michel-are you tired ?"&#xD;
"Mon Dicul Fatigue is no name for what I&#xD;
feel-what I have endured ! Where I am upon&#xD;
ze zaddel, I am like ze beefstik before it is&#xD;
cook. My back feel as if it was break, and my&#xD;
stomaque as if it was all shake an ay-! If it was&#xD;
not zat zis was a ver select cmpanee, I should&#xD;
acknowledge zat I was seek, and stop somewhere&#xD;
to get well, so I could walk razzer zan to ride !"&#xD;
"I'm sorry for you indeed !'' said Stuart, half&#xD;
inclined to laugh at the droll gestures of the&#xD;
house-sick Frenchman. " But in ten minutes,&#xD;
a cushioned chair, or one with a pillow in it,&#xD;
and a good hot toddy bf apple-jack will make&#xD;
you forget your present suffering!"&#xD;
"Forget! forget!" said Michel with a groan.&#xD;
"mare, a man may forget lis muzzare, lie may&#xD;
forget bis wife or his babes, lie may borrow&#xD;
money and forget to pay zat again, but, by dam,&#xD;
if he forget ze misery of ride a horse zat trot,&#xD;
trot all ze time, by dam; he no remember noss-&#xD;
ing-nossing at all !"&#xD;
Stuart, and all who heard Michel, burst out&#xD;
in a hearty laugh ; they could not help it, and&#xD;
at that moment the sign of a tavern close at&#xD;
hand met their eyes.&#xD;
And in ten minutes, true to Stuart's predic-&#xD;
tion, Michel in a big chair, with a pillow for a&#xD;
cushion, and a glass of apple-jack i his hand,&#xD;
was humming an old song, the chorus of which&#xD;
was, "Vive l'amour et cogniae !"&#xD;
"Better this thnu, riding, elm, old friend ?"&#xD;
asked Stuart, who, like ail true horsemen, had&#xD;
been seeing that his horse had proper care.&#xD;
" Bettare ? Ah, Capataine, zat is no name for&#xD;
it! I Bettare ! Is ze light bdtare zan ze dark?&#xD;
Is ze sweet bettare zan ze sour?  Is ze strong&#xD;

the better pleased we'll be !"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
The sun rose bright and clear the next morn-&#xD;
ing. There had been a few showers during the&#xD;
night, but the rain had not been continuous,&#xD;
nor so heavy as on the night before.&#xD;
After breakfast, Captain Stuart having se-&#xD;
eured a boat, started in company with Wash-&#xD;
burton, Beverly, Michel, and a selected part of&#xD;
the others for a crew, to investigate the oppo-&#xD;
site shore, and look into the lagoon or lagoons&#xD;
which he might find there. And it was not long&#xD;
after he reached the opposite shore before he&#xD;
discovered the well-blinded mouth of the little&#xD;
creek which led into the swamp which so well-&#xD;
concealed the place where IIunter had so long&#xD;
and so safely hidden his party.&#xD;
"Did you enter this creek when you went&#xD;
down ?" he asked of Warburton. -&#xD;
"No; we did not even see it !" said the&#xD;
latter.&#xD;
"Then we had best keep an eye open, and&#xD;
look to our arms !" said the wary guerrilla&#xD;
chief, for this is as likely a spot as any for them&#xD;
to take refuge in. We will follow the channel&#xD;
up at any rate, and see what is to be seen.&#xD;
Look to your arms, all hands!"&#xD;
" Pshaw! The niggers will never dare to&#xD;
show  fight !" said Beverly, contemptuously.&#xD;
"A hickory gad would drive a hundred of&#xD;
them!"&#xD;
"It would take more than that to drive old&#xD;
Tom IHunter !" said Stuart, quietly. " And if&#xD;
, you have had much experience with runaway&#xD;
niggers, you ought to know, if they've got arms,&#xD;
they'll use them. No man ever loses by being&#xD;
ready for action, brush or no brush !'&#xD;
"Well, if they do show fight, it will be the&#xD;
worse for them and Warburton's pocket !" said&#xD;
the other.&#xD;
The party now rowed on, somewhat troubled&#xD;
to keep the channel in the gloom of the swamp,&#xD;
but still making progress.&#xD;
And, after getting ashore a dozen times or&#xD;
more, they at last entered the bright and rapid&#xD;
little stream which I have before described, and&#xD;
at once, in newly-cut timber, and in stakes driven&#xD;
down on the shore to fasten boats to, discover-&#xD;
ed signs of the missing party,&#xD;
"By Jupiter, we've got them!" cried War-&#xD;
burton, excitedly.&#xD;
"Yes, if they have not gone. Some one has&#xD;
been here in boats lately, and by the sign of&#xD;
deerskins on the limbs yonder, they've had&#xD;
plenty of game !" said Stuart.&#xD;
4And zere is ze landing-place and ze road to&#xD;
somewhere," said Michel, pointing to a well-&#xD;
trodden path leading back from the creek.&#xD;
To land, secure the boat, and with the whole&#xD;
party following to cautiously examine the path&#xD;
&#xD;
SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
and follow it through the bushes, was Stuart's&#xD;
first work. Upon arriving at the edge of the&#xD;
little prairie, the huts were at once discerned,&#xD;
but no signs of any person could be discovered&#xD;
"I'm afraid we are too late !" said Stuart.&#xD;
"]But we will soon see !"&#xD;
And he gave the order to double quick with-&#xD;
out noise for the huts.&#xD;
lere the yebt burning embers of the fires,&#xD;
and plenty of fresh and yet untainted fish and&#xD;
venison, told that but a few hours had elapsed&#xD;
since the huts had been deserted.&#xD;
"Do you recognize any of these things?"&#xD;
Stuart asked of Warburton, as he pointed to a&#xD;
lot of the baggage left behind by Hunter's&#xD;
order.&#xD;
"Yes, distinctly ! These things all come&#xD;
from my place !" replied the young planter.&#xD;
"When do you suppose they left here ?"&#xD;
"Either last night or the night before-not&#xD;
sooner ; for the fires are not yet out, and the&#xD;
meat here is perfectly fresh. They evidently&#xD;
intended to make speed, or they would not&#xD;
have left so much behind them!"&#xD;
"Where do you think they have gone to ?"&#xD;
"Down the river, of course. No boat can go&#xD;
any higher than we have come. The creek is&#xD;
impassable above the landing. I saw that with&#xD;
a glance, and the last two nights have both&#xD;
been dark, and so stormy that our river-pickets&#xD;
would be of no use, for not one in a hundred&#xD;
would keep watch in such weather."&#xD;
"Then would not our best plan be to take the&#xD;
back track?" asked Warburton.&#xD;
"Certainly, dividing our party: One portion&#xD;
of us nill return on horseback, the others should&#xD;
follow the river in the boat. Of one thing I&#xD;
feel confident. Too good a watch is kept down&#xD;
at my house for them   to pass there, day or&#xD;
night!"&#xD;
Then we will arrange our party and hurry&#xD;
back. I begin to think we'll succeed yet, thanks&#xD;
to your sound sense and scouting skill, Captain&#xD;
Stuart !" said Warburton, joy fully.&#xD;
"I think myself that we'll get them below !"&#xD;
said Stuart. "And now, friend Michel, you will&#xD;
have a chance to exchange your trotting-horse&#xD;
for a boat-ride!"&#xD;
"Ab, zat make so much happy zat I cannot&#xD;
speak how glad I am! Sacrc, if we find ze&#xD;
niggares I will make zen carry inc in one pal-&#xD;
anquin like ze Chinese before I again ride ze&#xD;
horse zat trot !Trot is but one ozzate name&#xD;
for grand misery. If I was Messicur Jeff Davis,&#xD;
I would made every sacre Yankee prisounare do&#xD;
tossing but ride zQ horse z-it trot until lie swear&#xD;
he nevare again fight wiz ze South ! By dam,&#xD;
zat would take ze brave out of zen !"&#xD;
I'm afraid some of them would soon trot out&#xD;
of custody," said Stuart, with a laugh.  But&#xD;
back to the boat, gentlemen-every hour now&#xD;
will count; for, as the sailors say, a stern chase&#xD;
is apt to be a long one !"&#xD;

&#xD;
In ten minutes, more the party were again-&#xD;
afloat, and on their way out toward the river.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
And now reader, we will ourselves anticipate&#xD;
their pursuers, and go a nd look for Sadia and&#xD;
party.&#xD;
Steadily, all of the first night after their de-&#xD;
parture, they kept at the oars, and uninter-&#xD;
rupted they made good headway. It is true&#xD;
that they frequently saw lights along the shore,&#xD;
and often, even above the noise of the storm,&#xD;
heard the fierce barking of watchdogs which&#xD;
may have seemed them ; but just before day&#xD;
dawned they reached a small sluggish creek,&#xD;
with which IIunter was acquainted, and in this&#xD;
found concealment.&#xD;
Here, being close by large plantations on&#xD;
either side,  they passed a sadly-anxious d y&#xD;
not daring to leave the boats, or to make the&#xD;
least noise, for fear of discovery and detection,&#xD;
for more than once people came so near them that&#xD;
their voices could be distinctly heard.&#xD;
It was a painful day to poor Sad ia-her po-&#xD;
sition in the boat was cramped anduneasy, but&#xD;
no murmur did she utter, not even a sigh would&#xD;
she allow to escape her lips ; her heroic soul,&#xD;
warmed with the true fire of patriotism, scorned&#xD;
to set the bad exaJple of complaint.&#xD;
But it cannot be denied that she rejoiced when&#xD;
the long and weary day came to a close, a day&#xD;
spent by the thoughtless negroes in slumber;&#xD;
and her eyes, which had not closed all the day,&#xD;
brightened joyfully, when old Hunter, taking&#xD;
advantage of the darkness and the falling drops,&#xD;
of a light shower, one more gave the order to&#xD;
push out, and again resumed his course down&#xD;
the river.&#xD;
" Will we not by morning be so near the&#xD;
Federal lines that we can keep on without stop-&#xD;
ping:?" asked Sadia, in a low tone, of Hunter,&#xD;
after they had been under way some little time.&#xD;
"I hope so, lady. I sincerely hope so. If&#xD;
we only pass one place, I will risk it. The man&#xD;
I fear most o.n the river was once my friend, but&#xD;
he is the chitf of a band of guerrillas now, and&#xD;
is famed for his daring deeds IL the Rebel cause.&#xD;
I fear him and his band 'the most, and he lives&#xD;
close by the river-side. if we can but pass&#xD;
there before day, I will risk going on ; for it is&#xD;
not far from the Fcde:al lines if they are where&#xD;
I heard thcy were before we started."&#xD;
Urge the men to do their best, then," said&#xD;
Sadia. "My eyes will not close in sleep until&#xD;
we are safe, I am sure."&#xD;
"They are doing their best now, lady.  I&#xD;
gave them their orders before we started, and&#xD;
they are working as hard as they can, and still&#xD;
keep, it up."&#xD;
"1 think we do go even faster than we did&#xD;
last night. I hope and pray we can keep up&#xD;
your speed."&#xD;
"I will see to that, lady. Wrap yourself up&#xD;
&#xD;
closely, for if you get sick from this exposure,&#xD;
you will be helpless almost. I am a pretty fait&#xD;
sort cf pilot, but would make a poor band at&#xD;
doctori g."&#xD;
Do not fear my getting ill,' said Sadia,&#xD;
quietly. "Until we are safe, excitement alone K&#xD;
will sustain me.''&#xD;
"If you ceull lie back and sleep, I could&#xD;
cover you and the children together with this,&#xD;
sheet of canvas, and no rain coul1 reach you," "&#xD;
said Iiunter. "I would feel much easier if you l&#xD;
and I promise at the least sign of danger to&#xD;
awaken you."&#xD;
\V ell, to please you I will try," said Sadia,&#xD;
and she leaned back by the side  f her little&#xD;
loved ones, and the kind-hearted old man drew&#xD;
the sheltering canvas over her.&#xD;
And in spite of her belief that she could not,&#xD;
sleep, Sadia, worn down  itli long watching and&#xD;
alniety, and perhaps lulled by the soft drop.i&#xD;
ping of the rain, and -the gentle ripple of the&#xD;
waves, the best of soporific, soon showed by .&#xD;
her regular and heavy bretthing tht she slept.&#xD;
And this was much to the delight of the old -'&#xD;
fisherman ; for he had witnessed with pain that 1&#xD;
fatigue and cat e was fast wearing her strength ;&#xD;
away.&#xD;
She slept and dreamed. And at first it was a&#xD;
happy dream - a dream of chi!.lhood-s sunny&#xD;
hours.  Once more she lived beside her kind&#xD;
parents, the light and the j6y of their eyes--&#xD;
the recipient of blessed words of kindness.[V&#xD;
Agein, she wandered beneath the shady trees of&#xD;
Springland ; again, from amid the tail grass she&#xD;
gathered the anemone and the violet, and re-&#xD;
joiced in the perfumes which human art can&#xD;
only imitate, but never equal. Oh, that thou'l&#xD;
couldst thus dream forever, sweet Sadia!&#xD;
But even in dreams, change will come. And&#xD;
her dream changed.. She fancied that she was&#xD;
fl) ing over a waste and dreary desert, closely&#xD;
pursued by one whom she hatd so far as hate K&#xD;
could be felt in her noble heart. And her pur-&#xD;
suer was Randolph Beverly.    lie seemed to&#xD;
gain upon her, in spite of her exertions to&#xD;
escape. In her misery and terror she scream-&#xD;
ed, and-woke up !&#xD;
Woke, alas ! to a reality for Lrror; for the&#xD;
first gray of coming day was in the sky, and :&#xD;
dimly, right before them in the river, she could&#xD;
distinguish two boats flled w.th men, and she&#xD;
heard a stern and angry voice cry out:&#xD;
"IIold on with them oairs there, or you are&#xD;
dead geese ! We must see who you are !"    Cr&#xD;
Quick as thought, hunter cut the towing-line t&#xD;
between him and the boats astern, and said, in&#xD;
a low tone&#xD;
"Down w'th your head, Miss Sadia; quick, I&#xD;
am going to try to pass them, and if they fire:&#xD;
you may get hurt!"&#xD;
Then, in a louder tone, he sung out:&#xD;
" The river is as much ours as yours! Give&#xD;
way, boys, give way I"&#xD;

"Halt there ; halt, or we'll fire!" shouted the&#xD;
rst speaker.&#xD;
"Two can play at that game ! Look out, for&#xD;

Alas, for him, the ioo sudden reply! It came&#xD;
n a pistol-shot which pierced his breast, and so&#xD;
errified the craven negroes in the boat that they&#xD;
instantly ceased rowing, and cowered down in&#xD;
the bottom of the boat in abject fear and help-&#xD;
essness&#xD;
"There's something, you infernal Rebs, to&#xD;
ay for my dent h !" cried poor IIunter, as ral-&#xD;
ying strength, though wounded to death, he&#xD;
aised his gun and fired a load of buckshot into&#xD;
he boat which was nearest; the yells arising&#xD;
herefrom telling that the shot told effectually.&#xD;
"Miss - Miss Sadia !' gasped the dying man,&#xD;
'if you ever see the old General, tell him I died&#xD;
rue to the flag, God bless it, and-"&#xD;
He said no more--a gurgle, and h  was dead.&#xD;
The next moment, the boats were side by side,&#xD;
nd poor Sadia ! with whom to resist, now un-&#xD;
upported by her people, would be madness,&#xD;
ound herself a prisoner to men who boldly&#xD;
vowed themselves Rebels and guerrillas.&#xD;
" This must be the party those fellows were&#xD;
after, who stopped at the Captain's!"'said one&#xD;
ithe party.&#xD;
"Yes ; curse them ! Is that fellow dead who&#xD;
i red on us ?'' said atiother.&#xD;
" "Yes. You gave him his last dose !"&#xD;
"If it had taken effect earlier, it would have&#xD;
aved us one dead man, and three that are badly&#xD;
hurt. You had better take this lady and the&#xD;
diggers to the Captain's house, and keep them&#xD;
there till he comes back!"    -&#xD;
" Yes; that '11 be the best way."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
JThough a prisoner to rude men, Sadia re.&#xD;
eeived no direct insults ; for I care not what&#xD;
brothers say, I have yet to learn by personal ex-&#xD;
perience, or reliable authority, of a case where&#xD;
Americans, either North or South, forgot their&#xD;
manhood and treated the gentler sex with bru-&#xD;
tality. And iii a short time she and her little&#xD;
brother and sister were landed, and conducted&#xD;
to a house, with some of the inmates of which&#xD;
We are already acquainted.&#xD;
"Whom    have you here-what were you fir-&#xD;
ing for, Mr. Mendenhall ?" asked Kate Stuart,&#xD;
kas the leader of the party entered the house&#xD;
ahead of the prisoners.                 '&#xD;
1 "A lady and two white children who were&#xD;
;trying to run the river with a lot of niggers !"&#xD;
replied the man. "\Ve shot a white man, and&#xD;
;lost one of ours killed and three more wounded.&#xD;
;Will you find a safe place for the lady and chil-&#xD;
dren. We'll look out for the niggers!"&#xD;
"Yes, certainly! have your wounded men&#xD;
y brought in, mnd we will attend to them also !"&#xD;
"Thank you, Miss Kate ! I wish your father&#xD;
8t&#xD;
&#xD;
was here! I think this is the party that the&#xD;
men he has gone with were after."&#xD;
"Ah-indeed. I will soon know!"&#xD;
And when Sadia a moment after entered the&#xD;
house, her brother and sister clinging to her&#xD;
side, Kate bowed gently, and said:&#xD;
"Come with me, Miss De Montfort. I will&#xD;
try to make you comfortable in an upper&#xD;
room !"&#xD;
"Ah-you know my name ?" said Sadia, sur-&#xD;
prised and startled out of all presence of mind.&#xD;
"Certainly. Your brother and particular&#xD;
friend, Mr. Randolph Beverly, who were here&#xD;
looking for you, described you so particularly,&#xD;
that, as you see, I recognized you instantly !" re-&#xD;
plied the sharp-witted girl.&#xD;
' Randolph Beverly my friend? Ladd, if&#xD;
you knew how I loathe that man, you would&#xD;
not have the heart to utter his detested name in&#xD;
my presence !" said Sadia, hastily.&#xD;
"A  man! I did not think he deserved the&#xD;
name !" said Kate, with a laugh. "lHe made&#xD;
no friends here, I assure you!"&#xD;
"Then why am I made a prisoner when I&#xD;
am only flying from his hated adds esses !"&#xD;
"Your brother charges that you are carry-&#xD;
ing off his negroes ; I believe, and I suppose if&#xD;
my father was here, he would say that in car-&#xD;
rymg negroes over to the Federal lines you&#xD;
would be giving aid and comfort to the enemies&#xD;
of the Southern Confederacy !'' replied Kate ;&#xD;
"but come up stairs, lady, you and the chil-&#xD;
dren, and get your wet clothes off, and you eaa&#xD;
talk as much as you like, without so many lis-&#xD;
tening ears around you!"&#xD;
Sadia gladly turned to obey, for too many&#xD;
eyes were gazing upon her.&#xD;
"Do you want a guard, Miss Kate ?'' asked&#xD;
the temporary leader of the guerrilla band.&#xD;
"No-I will be responsible for the lady !"&#xD;
said Kate, quietly, leading the way to an upper&#xD;
chamber, where she was soon joined by her sis-&#xD;
ter, who gently and kindly aide A her in getting&#xD;
Sadia and the children to exchange their wet&#xD;
for dry clothes.&#xD;
"How can you be so kind to me, and yet&#xD;
have the heart to detain me to await the further&#xD;
persecution of my unkind brother and such a&#xD;
wretch as you acknowledge Randolph Beverly&#xD;
o be ?" asked Sadia, tearfully.&#xD;
"Who talks of detaining you, my dear girl?"&#xD;
asked Kate, quietly. "So far am I from doing&#xD;
it, that I am ready to aid you and these little&#xD;
ones to get as far from pursuit as possible. As&#xD;
to the negroes-there 1 dare not intefere, for&#xD;
they are property, and my father would never&#xD;
forgive me for giving you a chance to take therm&#xD;
with you !"&#xD;
"And you will indeed let me and my brother&#xD;
and sister go on&#xD;
"Yes, and help you to do it safely. I do&#xD;
not believe in the persecution of a sister wom-&#xD;
an, and I despised Mr. Beverly from the mo-&#xD;

&#xD;
ment he opened his lips in my presence. Why,&#xD;
the puppy actually made love to both my sister&#xD;
and myself, but he got more than he expected&#xD;
from both of us!"&#xD;
"Oh, bless you, dear ladies--bless you'" said&#xD;
Sadia, tears of joy pouring from her eyes.&#xD;
"There-there-don't cry, dear, or you'll set&#xD;
us to doing the same thing. I'll go down and&#xD;
have some breakfast ready, and send it up ; and&#xD;
to-night, if you are rested, we will see if ou&#xD;
cannot get started once more down the river !"&#xD;
A thousand thanks, dear lady-but stay. I&#xD;
have one favor which I hope you will forgive&#xD;
me for asking!"&#xD;
"IName it-we will do all that we can for&#xD;
you, without compromising our father's posi-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"A poor but honest old man was my guide&#xD;
down the river!" said Sadia, sadly. "He was&#xD;
killed a little while ago by the men who made&#xD;
u; prisoners. The faor I ask is, that he may&#xD;
be decently buried. His name was Thomas&#xD;
Hunter, and he was once a friend to your fa&#xD;
other !"&#xD;
"Poor old Tom hunter, I remember him&#xD;
well! ' said Kate. "Your request shall surely&#xD;
be attended to Miss Sad ia-I will see to it per-&#xD;
sonally. Now sit down and try to feel content-&#xD;
ed until I can get tune to see you again !"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
A day of rest worked wonders for Sadia, even&#xD;
though it was a day of sadness, with the re-&#xD;
membrance of poor hunter's sudden death&#xD;
upon her mind ; and the thought that her&#xD;
affectionate and faithful people would inevita-&#xD;
bly be retained, and undoubtedly now be sent&#xD;
South, into a worse servitude than they had&#xD;
ever known before.&#xD;
Often luring the day the two sisters came&#xD;
and tad.ed kindly to Sadia, and when she spoke&#xD;
of her old nurse, tearfully, as one who had&#xD;
ever been with ter. Kate avowed that she would&#xD;
take the responsibility upon herself of taking&#xD;
C nthia away frou the rest, and keeping her'&#xD;
with her mistress.&#xD;
And when Cynthia found that she was to go&#xD;
with hir dear 'iss Sa ly,'' the old woman&#xD;
)leal 5o loig and so   elI for her " ole man'', as&#xD;
she caild Niapolconi, that he too was included&#xD;
in the ang:iuemenmt, to his inexpressible joy ;&#xD;
for the ur Latest terror that can be brought in&#xD;
view f a Maryland negro is that of being&#xD;
" sold u7 South'.&#xD;
f " We aro the more ready to let yeu have&#xD;
these pople,' said Kate, by way of explana-&#xD;
tion, " b-c use your best way to reach Wash-&#xD;
ington with the chidliren nill yet be by the&#xD;
river, and you will need them to row your&#xD;
boat !"&#xD;
"But will be not be again stopped on the&#xD;
river and -arrested 7" asked Sadia, anxiously.&#xD;
"No; for before you leave I will give you a&#xD;
&#xD;
pass that all of our kind of people will respe4&#xD;
Kate Stuart's pass is as good as that of b&#xD;
father, where he is known ! Why. I go wi-4&#xD;
him  on very many of his expeditions! I'&#xD;
quite a warrior, I assure you !"&#xD;
And the beautiful girl laughed heartily.&#xD;
Sadia bad too much policy to s.o  w 'hat s}'&#xD;
thought, that she wished Karc woud war f&#xD;
the right instead of the wrong ; so shoesmil&#xD;
and said she hai no doubt she'd prove a vet&#xD;
table "Joan d'Arc."&#xD;
"Sister Annie is of a different mold !" ea;&#xD;
Kate, with her usual gay laugh.  " I amfpapa&#xD;
girl- wild, wayward   and untarnale ; twi&#xD;
more comfortable on the back of a cool her&#xD;
than I would be in a rockig-chair ; and&#xD;
more fond of listening to the bugle than t&#xD;
guitar or piano. But she, like my another,&#xD;
gentle, tender and loving, and wouldn't hurt&#xD;
cat without it crate ed her, much less draw&#xD;
bead on a man, as I have done, and hope to&#xD;
again !"&#xD;
Oh, Kate, Kate, what is the use of trying&#xD;
to make yourself out worse than you are ?" saii&#xD;
Annie, in a tone of gentle reproof.&#xD;
"I'm riot, sis -I'm not doing so ! You kno&#xD;
I'm a regular tiger-eat !"&#xD;
"I know that to me you are a good-heartel&#xD;
loving sister," said Annie.  "But," se cod&#xD;
tinted, "if we are to get Miss Dc Mlontfort o&#xD;
her road, it will soon be time to make prepay&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
"Yes ; they are mostly made, however. Sb&#xD;
must .eat a hearty supper before she goes, an&#xD;
after that, or before, if you like, Annie, I wi.&#xD;
you would fill a basket with something sub&#xD;
stantial, to last our guest until she gets into tha&#xD;
city. And Miss Sauia," shc added, turning i&#xD;
our heroine, ''you must promise that if at atn&#xD;
time you should chance to see me in the pre&#xD;
you will never recognize mec ini the presence &#xD;
any other person, or ever point me out as ti!&#xD;
daughter of a Confederate oicer ! '&#xD;
"Certainly, I wilrpro   cise that. You dA n&#xD;
think, after all your Luiiness, I could be so ut&#xD;
grateful as to betmay you?"&#xD;
''Certainly nut ! I knu  s u would not, it&#xD;
tentionally. But impnis ye ladies, and I ca&#xD;
see that you are impulse e, sumeluines forge&#xD;
themselves, and are not up      u  ir' guard, G&#xD;
an ice- hearted creature ;hke inil self al r;avs is!&#xD;
" You an ice-hearted creature l ' Eaid Sadi&#xD;
smihing in spite of her sadness.  ' I think yon&#xD;
blood and heart would be fouid on trial as war&#xD;
as that of those whor iByrom wrote about wh&#xD;
he said :&#xD;
"The cold in clime are cal i in blood,&#xD;
Their love can scarce deserve the name ;&#xD;
But thine is ]ke the lava-flood&#xD;
Which burns in iuai's breast of flame !"&#xD;
"Oh, don't quote poetry to me-I have not&#xD;
in my soul. 1'm all reality. So Ill send u&#xD;
your supper, of which yop must eat very heat&#xD;
&#xD;
SADIA.                                    53&#xD;
&#xD;
ily, for soon after you are done, I shall start&#xD;
you on your down-river 'trip, and you will feel&#xD;
the need of all your strength then."&#xD;
And Kate, witk a verse of the "Bonny Blue&#xD;
Flag" on her lips, hurried away. But Annie&#xD;
remained.&#xD;
"You must not think my sister half so wild&#xD;
or heartless as she pretends to be," said Annie,&#xD;
after Kate was gone. "Under her apparent&#xD;
levity, she conceals deep and tender feelings,&#xD;
and strong and true affections. She idolizes&#xD;
our father, and his wild and not unromantic life&#xD;
and many perils have charms for her. But it&#xD;
s her love for him, and fears for bis safety,&#xD;
which makes her so often his companion in&#xD;
Geenes of danger."&#xD;
"I doubt it not," said Sadia. "To me she&#xD;
acted lik an angel, and I shall never forget her,&#xD;
on, or your kind mother."&#xD;
"Do not speak of it. We are women, and do&#xD;
ut our duty to one of our sex who has been&#xD;
unmanfully persecuted. But there comes sup-&#xD;
er. Excuse me while I go to prepare some-&#xD;
hing for your support on your journey."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
So bad were the roads, that Michel in charge&#xD;
f the boat-party was some hours ahead of&#xD;
tuart and the other horsemen. And Michel&#xD;
id' not reach the house of the guerrilla until&#xD;
he afternoon of the day after Kate accompanied&#xD;
y the children, and Naipoleon, ;and Cynthia,&#xD;
ad departed for Washington. And so well had&#xD;
ate and her sister arranged that departure, and&#xD;
o carefully concealed it afterward, that not&#xD;
ne of the guerrillas stationed at that point&#xD;
new anything about it; and their information&#xD;
Michel was, that the whole party was there&#xD;
cept hunter, who had been killed.&#xD;
And thus he reported to Stuart, Warburton,&#xD;
nd Beverly, when, pretty we i fagged out, they&#xD;
rived at a late hour in the evening.&#xD;
"Just as Ihoped and expected," cried Stuart,&#xD;
yly, as he entered the house, and returned the&#xD;
nd salutes of -his daughters.&#xD;
"Where is my sister? I wish to see the&#xD;
rdened creature at once 1" said Warburton,&#xD;
rvously.&#xD;
"Does not Mr. Beverly share your anxiety?"&#xD;
id Kate, with a malicious smile. "I really&#xD;
mire his taste in failing in love with so much&#xD;
auty and wealth'!"&#xD;
"Of course, I should like to see my fair cou-&#xD;
," said Beverly, while a flush darkened his&#xD;
e-.&#xD;
"Then you had better continue your journey,&#xD;
r, as far as Washington, if you do not fear a&#xD;
serter's fate in that section," said Kate ; " for&#xD;
,e gentlegirl is there most undoubtedly before&#xD;
time."&#xD;
Kate, you young mischief, cease jesting,"&#xD;
ili her father, tapping her playfully on the&#xD;
&#xD;
am not jesting, father," said Kate, quietly.&#xD;
"Not jesting? You do not mean that the&#xD;
lady has escaped."&#xD;
"I mean, father, that she wished to go on to&#xD;
Washington with her brother and sister, and&#xD;
she went. She was rot property like the ne-&#xD;
groes. And I have never yet seen y}ou either&#xD;
harm, persecute, or detain a woman as a prison-&#xD;
er, my dear and noble father. And could I be&#xD;
so pitifully base as to keep a sweet and perse-&#xD;
cuted girl a prisoner here, to be forced to listen&#xD;
to the unwelcome addresses of a man whom she&#xD;
loathes and detests, even as I do, myself?"&#xD;
And Kate's flashing eyes rested upon the&#xD;
form of Beverly with a look of withering and&#xD;
unmitigated contempt.&#xD;
Stuart tried to look angry; but he loved his&#xD;
child too well to succeed in the attempt.&#xD;
"It was very wrong, Kate, very wrong," he&#xD;
said; "but since the negroes are here, Mr. De&#xD;
Montfort, I think, will be consoled for his loss."&#xD;
"D-n the negroes1" cried Beverly, in a&#xD;
towering rage. "I wouldn't have had that girl&#xD;
escape for thousands!'&#xD;
"Mr. Beverly's interest in the negroes, of&#xD;
course, vanishes with the lady who might have&#xD;
had a share of them had she remained," said&#xD;
Kate, in a tone of biting sarcasm.&#xD;
Beverly's face was almost black with passion ;&#xD;
and a reply, full of anger and insult, trembled&#xD;
on his lips; but he dared not utter his thoughts&#xD;
in the presence of Captain Stuart. Well he&#xD;
knew that the father's hand nvould quickly&#xD;
avenge any contumely cast upon the daughter.&#xD;
" I'm glad I've got'the niggers at any rate !"&#xD;
said Warburton, more qu-etly. "And the&#xD;
sooner I can get them out of my hands for&#xD;
cash, the better I shall be pleased, he added.&#xD;
" Can't you find a market for then, Stuart ?"&#xD;
" Yes, at reduced Irices ; but tey must be&#xD;
sent welt into the interior to get anything like a&#xD;
price for them."&#xD;
"I care not where they are sent. It will per-&#xD;
haps, be a long time before I shall need hands&#xD;
on the plantation !  I will leave their dispo-&#xD;
sition entirely to you, Captain Stuart, trusting&#xD;
to your honor that you inul do as well as you&#xD;
can for me."&#xD;
"Well, I will accept the trust. But here's&#xD;
something from head-quarters, by the looks of&#xD;
the messenger."&#xD;
A man dressed in the gray uniform of the&#xD;
Confederate Army, who had just ridden up at&#xD;
full speed, dismounted, and handed Stuart a&#xD;
package.&#xD;
"Give me joy, gentlemen !" cried the latter,&#xD;
as be unfolded and read an official document&#xD;
and a letter which accompanied it. "IIere is&#xD;
my commission as a Colonel in the Confederate&#xD;
Army, and the promise of that of a Brigadier-&#xD;
General in the Cavalry as soon as I raise twen-&#xD;
ty-five hundred men. Warburton, if you will&#xD;
go up and recruit the men you told me of, yeo&#xD;

brigade you shall have my regiment."&#xD;
"A bargain, by Jupiter, Colonel, a bargain!'&#xD;
cried the young planter. "You attend to m3&#xD;
niggers, and I'll take the back-track for Spring&#xD;
land in the morning !"&#xD;
"You certainly take your sister's escape with&#xD;
t1e children very coolly !" said Beverly, bit.&#xD;
terly.&#xD;
"Why should I not. I have no one to look&#xD;
out for a support but myself now," said War-&#xD;
burton, winh a dry laugh.&#xD;
f   By heavens, I will not give her up so easily,&#xD;
or be made a laugh ing-stock of!" cried Beverly,&#xD;
in a rage. ."I am worth a few thousands yet,&#xD;
and I'll spend every cent to make that proud&#xD;
girl my wife -"&#xD;
b." Will you not have me or Sister Annie now&#xD;
asked Kate, sarcastically. "You were very at-&#xD;
tentive to each of us in turn, the other day !"&#xD;
"ate, Kate, this is going too far.!" said Cap-&#xD;
tain Stuart, gravely. "Remember that Mr.&#xD;
Beverly is my guest."&#xD;
"Pardon, father, pardon ! I could not help&#xD;
it!" said Kate, demurely.  I'll go and read&#xD;
French for two hours, by way of penance. Au&#xD;
rcvoir "&#xD;
"Stop, you little tease ! Go and see that our&#xD;
supper is got ready. We are half famished !"&#xD;
"I'm all obedience, dear father. It shall be&#xD;
on the table in a few minutes."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
"Messieur Beverly, suppose you come out in&#xD;
ze air wiz me-it is more cool, and we can&#xD;
mf'ke one cigar of tabac before ze suppare !"&#xD;
said Michel, who had been a listener during the&#xD;
scene detailed in the foregoing chapter.&#xD;
Beverly, who wasbangry with everything, him-&#xD;
self included, was about to reply angrily to the&#xD;
Frenchman's invitation ; but a meaning look in&#xD;
Michels eye restrained him, and he saw that an&#xD;
interview was wanted by the latter.&#xD;
"Well, I need cooling off," said he, bluntly.'&#xD;
eI have no objection to loin you in a prom-&#xD;
enade and a cig ir."&#xD;
And the two left the house.&#xD;
"You wanted to see me for something, where&#xD;
others were not present, did you not, Michel V'&#xD;
asked Beverly.&#xD;
" Certainement / Zat was why I desire you to&#xD;
take wiz me ze air.".&#xD;
"Well, what is on the tapis ?"&#xD;
"Zis ! Youobsrved a little time ago zatyou&#xD;
would give all ze tousand dollare zat you pos-&#xD;

shall be well paid for it, vou and your friends!'&#xD;
"Eh bien-zat is all zat we shall require!&#xD;
y replied Michel. "And now, Messieur Beveri&#xD;
- what shall you do-whe're go you from here?"&#xD;
"To Riehmond, as soon as I can, to see a&#xD;
old friend, Mr. Mallory, the Secretary of th&#xD;
Navy. Ie will soon find a place where am&#xD;
services will be required."&#xD;
"Eh, bien ! I shall very soon go to Richmon&#xD;
myself. From zere I shall conic to ze Shes&#xD;
peake, for one very gran' spec ulatione is to b&#xD;
in ze smuggle of sings zat are never made in&#xD;
Sout-in carry arms and nice sings for ze lad'&#xD;

"Ah, that is the secret of your intended spe&#xD;
ulation. I have no doubt that it will be profi&#xD;
ble-dangerous, too, I should judge."&#xD;
"Some danger--some danger !" said Miche&#xD;
shrugging up his shoulders as only a Frenchma.&#xD;
can.  "But nevare mind zat, if plenty of&#xD;
money come. I have run many grand risk fo&#xD;
ze money-many, many upon ze sea and land.&#xD;
"But there is one thing money couldn't tern&#xD;
you to do," said Beverly, smiling for the fir&#xD;
time since he had heard of Sadia's departure.&#xD;
e What is zat, I should lik for to know ?" as&#xD;
-ed Michel.&#xD;
"To ride a hard-trotting horse a thousan&#xD;
miles," said Beverly, with a Lagh.&#xD;
"Sacrc'  You are right, Messieur Beverl&#xD;
All ze gold zat a horse could carry would n&#xD;
make me' endure so much misery. No, Sar&#xD;
no! When I'go to Richmond, I will ride in 4&#xD;
cart wiz ze ox for draw me, or I will walk wizo&#xD;
ze shoe to my foot, before I ride ze horse&#xD;
trot."&#xD;
"Why do you not go with me in the morning&#xD;
I intend to buy or hire- a carriage, for my o&#xD;
use ; for, to tell the truth, I do not care to e&#xD;
tend my own horseback-exercise."&#xD;
"When shall you depart ?"&#xD;
"To-morrow morning, as early as possible&#xD;
I don't want to stay a minute longer than I ca&#xD;
help under the same roof with that devilish an&#xD;
provoking girl. By Jove ! if she had a love&#xD;
.Id kill him out of spite, and try to break i&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
"I cannot go so soon," said Michel. "1 mu.&#xD;
hear from my friends in Baltimore and in Was&#xD;
ington before I go.  But nevare mind.  I vi&#xD;
be zere all in good time. And it is very pose'&#xD;
ble zat I may hear of ze ladee before you shl&#xD;

"Well, do your best, my dear friend.  Yo&#xD;
know my desire, and you shall not regret an&#xD;
service that you may render me !"&#xD;
"Ehi, bien ! I will not forget you."&#xD;
"Supper, gentlemen, supper," cried Stuar&#xD;
at the door.&#xD;
" Zat is one very good word at zis time," sau&#xD;
Michel, throwing away his cigar.&#xD;
&#xD;
SOne that will not neea muchrepe'it ou "&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
Safe7n The eity of Washington, but carried&#xD;
at once before the Provost-Marshal by the&#xD;
pic'ket-guard which she first met inside the Fed-&#xD;
eral lines, the wild anxiety and, terror of Sadia&#xD;
was ver.&#xD;
The gallant young De Kay, aid to General&#xD;
Mnsfield, was the examining officer,; and not&#xD;
only were Sadia's explanations fully satisfactory&#xD;
to him, but his gentlemanly courtesy such, that&#xD;
be escorted her to the house of a genteel and&#xD;
very respectable lady, who, upon his statement,&#xD;
readily agreed to board Sadia. and the children,&#xD;
as well as the two servants, while our heroine&#xD;
chose to remain in the city.&#xD;
And upon her stating that she desired to see&#xD;
General Scott, to convey to him the dying ines-&#xD;
sage bf her faithful guide, the young officer of-&#xD;
fered on the following morning to procure her&#xD;
an interview with the venerable hero, though he&#xD;
,    was then harrassed with a flood of business,&#xD;
though confined to his room by illness which&#xD;
altogether precluded his taking the saddle and&#xD;
heading the Army in person, as be had done&#xD;
through two glorious and successful wars, and&#xD;
desired to do again.&#xD;
Thus we see that, with manly and chivalric&#xD;
hearts,our Sadia, beautiful, gentle, and in dis-&#xD;
tress, could but find friends. And thankful was&#xD;
she on finding herself safe in that great city ; and&#xD;
no one need wonder thathwhen she retired to&#xD;
her pleasant chamber that night, with those&#xD;
dear children by her side, she breathed a heart&#xD;
felt prayer of thankfulness to the Father of all,&#xD;
for her deliverance from peril.&#xD;
fAnd what can be more beautiful than to see&#xD;
the young and pure-hearted looking up to the&#xD;
Source of goodness and purity with thankful&#xD;
eyes-trusting in that Arm which knows nc&#xD;
weakness-hopeful and strong even in tha&#xD;
trust!&#xD;
In the forenoon of the day after her arriva&#xD;
in the city, Sadia was visited by the young offi&#xD;
cer before-mentioned, who kindly came to fulfil&#xD;
his promise to escort her into the presence o&#xD;
the hero of Lundy's Lane. For those who lov&#xD;
himu need not look over his hundred battle-field&#xD;
for his fame-they most love to dwell upon tha&#xD;
field where the proud Britons were iwakene&#xD;
from the dream that they alone were invineibl&#xD;
with the bayonet.&#xD;
The General, though unable to rise from hi&#xD;
invalid chair, received his visitors with urbani&#xD;
ti, and listened with interest to the story of Sa&#xD;
nlia; and he, a son hinelf of a seceded and r&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
belliut Statea 6Ol well appteeiate the pttot-&#xD;
ism which had impelled her action.&#xD;
Arid when she came to speak of Hunter,&#xD;
whom he did not remember until the duel&#xD;
fought to vindicate his name from foul asper-&#xD;
sion was spoken of, the old warrior's eye glist-&#xD;
ened with the dew of sorrow, and be expressed'&#xD;
his regret that the gallant and faithful old man&#xD;
had not lived to see him, and to receive the&#xD;
pressure of his friendly hand.&#xD;
"We are all passing away-we of the olden&#xD;
time !" said the General, with a sigh. "We&#xD;
must rest content with past deeds, and let&#xD;
younger men win the laurels of the present un-&#xD;
happy contest 1"&#xD;
"We cannot do without you, General !" said&#xD;
De Kay, while his manly face flushed with a&#xD;
smile of undisguised admiration. "Take our&#xD;
old General from us, and what can we do.?"&#xD;
"Much, young man-much ! You will find&#xD;
this an age when generals, undreamed of be-&#xD;
fore, called into life, almost, by the great neces-&#xD;
sities of war, will spring up and grow to be&#xD;
famous in a day. This war, which well I know&#xD;
will not be a trifling matter of months, but a&#xD;
deadly strife of years, will prove world-wide&#xD;
that we are a nation of warriors; and where&#xD;
you count warriors by millions, generals will&#xD;
not be lacking-generals fit for any age, or na-&#xD;
tion, or command !"&#xD;
And in his enthusiasm, the old hero seemed&#xD;
to forget the pain which racked his limbs and&#xD;
I made old wounds ache afresh. His eyes flashed&#xD;
-the color came to hl3 cheeks and brow, and&#xD;
his tall form seemed to swell with the strength&#xD;
- of past memories.&#xD;
Then turning gently and kindly to Sadia, he&#xD;
1 asked if she had formed any plans for her fu-&#xD;
ture..&#xD;
uI have a few friends and acquaintances in&#xD;
- Baltimore," she replied; "and if there would&#xD;
,be safety there, and I could live as a loyal&#xD;
woman there without persecution, I s-hould de-&#xD;
e sire it !" she replied. "The more especially as&#xD;
e my altered position will force me to some indus-&#xD;
I trial method of supporting myself and my lit-&#xD;
o tie brother and sister ; for at present I can get&#xD;
t nothing from my late father's estate I"&#xD;
"You Will be as safe in Baltimore ; yes, even&#xD;
Li more so than here, for I have strong and abid-&#xD;
- ing faith in the loyalty of the great majority of&#xD;
1 its citizens. It was true as steel in 1812-it&#xD;
f will be now. And the scene of war will be near&#xD;
e this city, even, perhaps, in it, before this Rebel-&#xD;
s lion is crushed. The first aim of the insur-&#xD;
,t gents will be, to take it. Had it not been for&#xD;
d my preparations, and the readiness of the Pres-&#xD;
e ident in calling out troops, they would before&#xD;
this time have been upon us. Yes, my dear&#xD;
s young lady, I would adviseyuu to go there, es-&#xD;

"I thank you. General, most sincerely, and&#xD;

"Thank you, thank you, lady. My years, I&#xD;
feel, are nearly numbered, but I humbly pray&#xD;
that I may be spaimed to see my whole co-intry&#xD;
again united, and powerful in its union !"&#xD;
The interview was over, and Sadia left the&#xD;
bouse of the old soldier, with a grateful heart ;&#xD;
for little had she dreamed to meet with so much&#xD;
gentleness and kindness from  one whose life&#xD;
had ever been a stern and warlike reality, es-&#xD;
pecially at a time when his body was racked&#xD;
with agony. and his mind could not but be fill-&#xD;
ed with painful anxiety and worn down with&#xD;
the business of his military chieftainship. For&#xD;
vet he was at the head of the Army; if not in&#xD;
the field. he was stilt its chief-its almost idol-&#xD;
ized chief.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
A comparison of the two men, and then I'll&#xD;
go ahead with this story. Years ago, when un-&#xD;
der brave old "Rough and Ready", as we loved&#xD;
to call General Taylor, I served under my'&#xD;
country's flag in Florida, I met two young men.&#xD;
.l The first of them was born under the Spanish&#xD;
flag before the province of Florida was trans-&#xD;
ferred to us, and the blood of a proud and&#xD;
chivalric race of ancestors coursed through his&#xD;
veins. his family lived in the most ancient of&#xD;
American cities. St. Augustine. And nobleness,&#xD;
beauty, and grace, seemed a heritazc with them&#xD;
all. Soon after Florida became a United States&#xD;
Territory, the young man (then a boy) alluded&#xD;
to. catered the United States Navy as a Mid-I&#xD;
shipman. Having served the probationary time,&#xD;
he passed his examination with honor, and step&#xD;
by s 'ep advanced in service, until at this time&#xD;
(1838) he is in command of a gallant corvette&#xD;
in our service.&#xD;
When the war broke out arld such recreants&#xD;
ns Tttnall, Semmes, and Mafft turned their&#xD;
backs upon the country which has fed, clothed,&#xD;
and educated them, he, though wealthy, and&#xD;
able to lve in princely stvie in his own or a&#xD;
fo-eign land, remained true to his country and&#xD;
his flag, and forgot not ihe oath which h-e took&#xD;
when he accepted his commission. His name&#xD;
should-grace these pages, did I not know that&#xD;
his modest and chivalric heart shrinks from pub,&#xD;
licity. But let those who glance at the "Naval&#xD;
Register" see who has cormmanded the St.&#xD;
Louis, corvette, since the commencement of the&#xD;
Rebellion, and they may learn whom I do much&#xD;
honor, and admire for his fidelity i contrast&#xD;
with s0 many bad examples in others.&#xD;
&#xD;
The other yrong ma, I a'so knew in F'orida,&#xD;
as one whose first start in life came from Gov-&#xD;
ernment patronage, as one who received much&#xD;
favor and aid from the United States, who, to&#xD;
give him credit, rose fron complete obscurity to&#xD;
the high position of a United St ates senator.&#xD;
Now, alas'! he was sunk into the dead sea of trea-&#xD;
son, and is, and hs b. en since tihe advent of thbe&#xD;
Satanic Confederacy, the Secretary of its so-&#xD;
called Navy. His name is Stephen R. Mallory.&#xD;
And now, reader, to do him toll justice-nJo,&#xD;
we cannot do that, it were a hangman's sub-we&#xD;
must describe him as he incidentally here steps&#xD;
into our story.&#xD;
Imagine, then, reader, a man rather above the&#xD;
medium size, somewhat portly, with thick&#xD;
bushy hair just turning to gray, a fine florid&#xD;
complexion, well bewhiskered, good featured,&#xD;
and with sharp, intelligent eves. Well dressed,&#xD;
genteel in manner, and very plausible in speech,&#xD;
he is one of that class who always, or almost&#xD;
always, make themselves popular wherever they&#xD;
are.&#xD;
&#xD;
And we now introduce&#xD;
Randolph Beverly, who&#xD;
orders to some position in1&#xD;
ice.&#xD;
&#xD;
him listening to Mr.&#xD;
has come to ask for&#xD;
the Conofederate serv-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Had you come but a day or two earlier, I&#xD;
could have at once giv-n you orders in a sea-&#xD;
going vessel. 1 regret that we have none&#xD;
ready for sea in any port which can'be left. I&#xD;
am sorry, Lieutenant, for your sake. But I can&#xD;
give you temporary duty in one of our gun-&#xD;
bo:its tn the James Rig er, and I will remember&#xD;
your claims for better position the very first&#xD;
time an opening offers."&#xD;
A thousand thanks, Mr. Mallory, a thousand&#xD;
thanks. I hope it will not be long before we&#xD;
have the. nucleus of a hauds}one navy afloat,"&#xD;
said Beveriy.&#xD;
It will not be long, Lieutenant, it will not be&#xD;
long," said the Secretary, rubbing his hands&#xD;
together in his usual ph-asant way. " When&#xD;
oid England begins to feel the want of our cot-&#xD;
ton, and her starving operatives cry for work or&#xD;
revolution, you'll see that she will help us, and&#xD;
a -navy will spring in-o lice in a hurry. Yes,&#xD;
Sir, yes ! It will not be long that the cursed&#xD;
Yankees will be enabled to blockade our ports,&#xD;
My gifted friend, Maury, who so opportunely&#xD;
caused the destruction of lights and buoys along&#xD;
the coast, is also engaged in the invention of a&#xD;
class of vessels which will open the wondering&#xD;
eyes of a world-of a world, Sir. lie is a great&#xD;
man, that Maury, Sid-a great man!"&#xD;
And again the Secretary rubbed his hands&#xD;
together, and then brushed back the bushy hair&#xD;
from over his brow.&#xD;
Dine with me to-day, Lieutenant," said be,&#xD;
"and you will see Maury at my house. And if&#xD;
you call here to-morrow morning at ten, your&#xD;
orders shall be ready for you. But you must&#xD;
consider the duty only temporary, to ccupy&#xD;

your time until something better offers. You&#xD;
shall have a command as soon as possible.'&#xD;
"Whtat will be the nature of our duty on the&#xD;
James ?" asked Beverly.&#xD;
"Merely keeping an eye on the Yankees&#xD;
down about its mouth, making a dash on any-&#xD;
thing that can be dashed at without risk, and&#xD;
injuring them whenever any chance offers." I&#xD;
Well, Sir, I will be ready for any orders to-&#xD;
morrow morning."&#xD;
"Your orders will be ready then, but the&#xD;
boat I think of attaching you to is now fitting&#xD;
out here, and it will be a week or two before she&#xD;
will be ready for service. You must remember&#xD;
that, while you are in Richmond, my house is&#xD;
ever open to you. The officers of the old Navy&#xD;
who join us now, will find in me an ardent&#xD;
friend. In fact we can have no navy without&#xD;
them.   We have no seafaring men among our&#xD;
citizens ; and for our crews, must look almost&#xD;
altogether to a foreign shore.&#xD;
"It is too true, Sir; but old England on our&#xD;
side, and, quite as likely, France, we will not&#xD;
lack for seaman."&#xD;
"No, indeed, and I hope they will be in a&#xD;
hurry with their recognition of our indepen.&#xD;
deuce. Delay wilt be death to our hopes.&#xD;
Money and agesits, however, will soon be at&#xD;
work with both of t'e Governments we have&#xD;
named, and we must hope for success."&#xD;
I shall look for it, Sir. But I intrude upon&#xD;
your business-hours. Good morning, Mr. Mal-&#xD;
lory."&#xD;
"Good morning, Lieutenant. Do not forget&#xD;
that I dine at four o'clock, and that Maury will&#xD;
be there."&#xD;
CIIAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
Randolph Beveriv ;id been in Richmond&#xD;
nearly or quite two weeks. He had become at-&#xD;
tached to a vessel christened a " gunboat", but&#xD;
rather a hard-looking craft to be honored with&#xD;
the name of a man-of-war-merely an old James&#xD;
Rivdr tow-boat, with a couple of the iron guns&#xD;
on board that had been stolen from the Gosport&#xD;
Navy Yard, opposite Norfolk, when naval imbe-&#xD;
cility on the Federal side allowed the capture&#xD;
of that most important point, with its immense&#xD;
armament, which has since armed Port Hudson,&#xD;
Vicksburg, Forts henry, Donelson, and a hun-&#xD;
dred other Rebel defences.&#xD;
He was returning from an early visit to the&#xD;
"Exterminator", as the gunboat had been des-&#xD;
perately named, cogitating in his mind the kind&#xD;
of "smile" in which he should indulge when he&#xD;
reached the "Exchange", which was close at&#xD;
band, when a loud and hearty bail brought him&#xD;
to, nautically speaking, in a hurry.&#xD;
" Ah, ha. Messieur Beverly ! Ah, ha! How&#xD;
you shall do-how you shall do, my von frent !"&#xD;
That hail and that accent could come from no&#xD;
other than our old acquaintance, Carl Michel.&#xD;
And not at all displeased to meet him, Lieu-&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
tenant Beverly hastened to join hands with the&#xD;
Frenchman.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you, Michel !" he cried.&#xD;
"Come into the Exchange and liquidate, my&#xD;
frient ! I was just thinking of doing it, when I&#xD;
heard your welcome voice !"&#xD;
"Eh bien-zat is if you mean by liquidate,&#xD;
zat it is somesing for to drink, for I feel so dry&#xD;
as one old chip !"&#xD;
"That is what I mean, my friend. How do&#xD;
you leave our friend Stuart, and my cousin&#xD;
Warburton ?"&#xD;
"Colonel Stuart, I leave very well. He was&#xD;
much occupy wiz organize and drill his men.&#xD;
But, Messieur De Montfort, your cousine have&#xD;
depart ze very same day as you, for to recruit&#xD;
men for ze Confederate cavalry-men zat can&#xD;
endure ze trot-ze miserable trot!"&#xD;
"How did you make your journey here ?&#xD;
asked Beverly, who could hardly keep from&#xD;
laughing at the comical grimace and shrug&#xD;
which accompanied the words spoken by&#xD;
Michel.&#xD;
" Ah, I have superb accomodashione ! I com&#xD;
all ze way in a carriage, wiz a ladee-a very&#xD;
nice ladee, Sare-one what you call zem-one&#xD;

"I wish you success !" said Beverly, laugh&#xD;
fng. "By-the-way, have you heard anything&#xD;
more of my runaway sweetheart, Miss De Mont.&#xD;
fort ?"&#xD;
"No, not so soon. But I have instruct my&#xD;
correspondents and friends in Washington and&#xD;
Baltimore to keep a lookout and find where she&#xD;
is. And from them I soon shall hear. Very&#xD;
soon, in one disguise, I shall go to Baltimore&#xD;

"I would give you half that I own. Yes, if&#xD;

his eyes flashing with excitement.&#xD;
"Well, sings more strange zan zat have oc-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
One more glance at our Sadia. For I know&#xD;
the reader must take an interest in one who has&#xD;
risked so much to prove her devotion to the&#xD;
cause for which so many of our bravest and&#xD;
best have given their lives.&#xD;
Soon after the kind General-in-Chief had fur-&#xD;
nished our heroine with her promised letters of&#xD;
introduction, she left Washington with her&#xD;
young charges and her two faithful servants,&#xD;
for Baltimore. And well indeed was it for her&#xD;
that the generous forethought of the old vet-&#xD;
eran had furnished those letters. For several&#xD;
of the friends whom she expected to find in tihe&#xD;
city had left-some of them   less loyal than&#xD;
she had hoped ; others, even more doubtful of&#xD;
the security of the city than the old General&#xD;
had been, had gone still further North ; and&#xD;
even the few who were there seemed more cold&#xD;
to the fugitive loyalist than they had been in&#xD;
former times to the wealthy planter's favorite&#xD;
child-and she keenly felt this, for proud hearts&#xD;
are ever sensitive, and hers, proud as it was&#xD;
pure, shrunk   from  receiving  any chilling&#xD;
favors.&#xD;
TLerefore, after securing a place of residence&#xD;
in a genteelly respectable private family, at as&#xD;
low a rate as possible (for her stock of money&#xD;
was but too small for the use of one who had&#xD;
been accustomed to every luxury), she looked&#xD;
over her introductory letters, determining to&#xD;
make use of them in the endeavor to find some&#xD;
occupation.&#xD;
The first which she took from a package of&#xD;
six or seven, was addressed to a wealthy im-&#xD;
por ing firm, whose principal member had also&#xD;
ling held a high political position in the coun-&#xD;
try. arid who had taken an especiallv loyal&#xD;
stand in the present crisis, as she had before&#xD;
learned  through  the public  papers.   She&#xD;
glanced at his name, and the thought struck&#xD;
her that she had heard her father speak of him,&#xD;
while he lived, as an acquaintance arid a friend.&#xD;
A few moments' thought decided her to go and&#xD;
see him before all others. And, with her usual&#xD;
firmness of character, to think was a prelude&#xD;
only to acting.&#xD;
&#xD;
Therefore, n an early hour she called at th&#xD;
place of business of the firm. The gentleman&#xD;
whom she wished to see was not yet there, but&#xD;
she was directed to his residence, where she&#xD;
would be sure to iivd him for some hours to&#xD;
come.&#xD;
In one of the most pleasant locations in the&#xD;
city she found his residence, ndl upon inquiry&#xD;
found that he wasthere.&#xD;
She was ushered into a parlor fitted up in&#xD;
neatly elegant stL le, arl orioinented, not in&#xD;
the usual " gineerhread st le" of the day, but&#xD;
w;th a taste r.rely Exeelled. P.witings of true&#xD;
merit hWg in fav'or.able iilits on ilthe walls--&#xD;
ever thing' in vieW was v :ri nab le aid durable.&#xD;
Mr. Winter, we will call himt (for it is not&#xD;
politic always to use real namuwrs) entered the&#xD;
parlor-door after Sadia had se nt her card by&#xD;
the servint ; an i though the frost of tull sixty&#xD;
winters had w hiteiied the hair upon itis head,&#xD;
anything but wudcr/ uas the smile nith which&#xD;
he greeted the ditrident girl, who rose when he&#xD;
entered the room.&#xD;
"Miss De Montfoi t ?" he said, as ie glanced&#xD;
at her and then at the car d which he held in&#xD;
his hand. "I once had a 'i lued friend of that&#xD;
name who lived on the banks of the Potomac-&#xD;
Charles De Montfort !"&#xD;
"Of Springland, Sir ; he was my father!&#xD;
IIe was taken from  us by the hand of death&#xD;
some time since!" said Sadia, as she handed&#xD;
the gentleman her letter of introduction.&#xD;
" I had so heard and grieved to hear it, for I&#xD;
knew him as a good and patriotic mai !" said&#xD;
Mr. Winter, opening the letter and perusing&#xD;
the contents.&#xD;
"The daughter, it appears, is indEed worthy&#xD;
of such a father, too," he said, when lie had&#xD;
finished the letter. " A recommendation so&#xD;
strong, and from such a source, is a thing to&#xD;
be proud of, my dear young lady; but your&#xD;
father's daughter would have needed no other&#xD;
comnendation to me than her own assurance&#xD;
of loyalty at this dark hour in our country's&#xD;
history. My house shall be your home, if you&#xD;
will accept the offer, and I shall feel happy in&#xD;
having such a guesr. My wife and daughter&#xD;
will welcome and love you!''&#xD;
"I am grateful for your offer, Sir; but I can-&#xD;
not accept any home :is a mere guest. I came&#xD;
to you, Sir, to ask your aid in procuring me a&#xD;
situation where I can make use of the good&#xD;
practical education nhich my father gave me.&#xD;
My means are limited. I have my little broth-&#xD;
er and sister to take care of, and 1 wish to earn:&#xD;
my support. I ean be happy in no other way-&#xD;
believe me, Sir, I cannot; for I inherit indepen-&#xD;
dence, if nothing else, from my dear father's&#xD;
nature."&#xD;
"A situation, my dear young ady ? Remem-&#xD;
ber you have been used to live without a supe-&#xD;
rior-you will find j hard to be under one&#xD;
now."&#xD;

SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I can bend myself to circumstances. I have&#xD;
made my mind firmly up to that," Sadia, re-&#xD;
plied, quietly.&#xD;
" Wiat do you wish? The position of a gov-&#xD;
erness or teacher?"&#xD;
"Not if I can get writing or copying to do ;&#xD;
for I fear I have not the long-enduring patience&#xD;
that a governess or teacher must possess to ful-&#xD;
fill their office properly. I write a good, plain,&#xD;
bold hind ; used to keep all my father's accounts,&#xD;
and am, therefore, correct in figures. I studied&#xD;
arithmetic, algebra, and bookkeeping before I&#xD;
learned French.'&#xD;
Mr. Winter smiled at the confession which&#xD;
not every young lady would have made.&#xD;
"If you insist upon hasig something to do,"&#xD;
le continued. "I have a vacancy which can be&#xD;
made by promotingg a very worthy and loyal&#xD;
man to an even better position. It is the keep-&#xD;
ing of our invoice-book, into which all our in-&#xD;
voices are entered, with a register of each, their&#xD;
number, and their arrangement. If you will&#xD;
accept that, and his salary of one thGusand dol-&#xD;
lars a year, le shall be promoted."&#xD;
"0   Sir ; \oi are too kind, and make me&#xD;
quite happy ! When can I commence ?" cried&#xD;
Sadia. who almost seemed to see a fortune in&#xD;
the kind offer.&#xD;
" Topmor row, if you like, my dear young lady.&#xD;
But let me renew the offer of a home in my&#xD;
house."&#xD;
"Under other circumstances, Mr. Winter, I&#xD;
would grat-fully accept an offer tendered with&#xD;
such generous and fatherly kindness. But in&#xD;
the house where I have secured a most comfort-&#xD;
able home, and where even the little which I&#xD;
pay for board is needed, a good and loyal man&#xD;
is lying sick .and bed-ridd-n, supported by his&#xD;
industrious wife, who needs boarders to do so.&#xD;
She was so glad to get me, and she has been so&#xD;
kind and motherly to me already, that it would&#xD;
be cruel in me to lea:e her. And she also finds&#xD;
employment for t e tuo faithful negroe s, my&#xD;
old nurse anil her husband, who came with me&#xD;
from Sprimgland. I cannot make them under-&#xD;
stand that I nisli them to be free, and they will&#xD;
net leave rime  There they can be kept at work,&#xD;
and be conrented while they earn enough to&#xD;
clothe them and provide them with many lux-&#xD;
uries. Do rot think, my dear Sir, that I am&#xD;
ungrateful for your offer of a home, but accept&#xD;
the reasons  hieti I have giv n for my refusal."&#xD;
"I do,. Miss Dc Mon tirt, recognizing no false&#xD;
pride in your refusal, but a noble principle in&#xD;
your vishi to remain where you are. It only&#xD;
adds to my high estimation of your qualities of&#xD;
head and heart. You will ever find a friend in&#xD;
me, and my family will be but too glad to know&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"S hall I go to your counting-house to-mor&#xD;
row, Sir ?"&#xD;
"Yes, at ten o'clock. Your hours will b4&#xD;
only from ten to two, in a small office by your&#xD;
&#xD;
61&#xD;
&#xD;
self; or if you prefer it, you can have the in-&#xD;
voices sent to your own rowns. Although that&#xD;
would not be so handy, for we often have to re-&#xD;
fer to the book."&#xD;
"Then I prefer to go to the office, Sir. It is not&#xD;
a long walk from my rooms, and if the weather&#xD;
is stormy, the city cars, for a trifle, will take me&#xD;
nearly all the way."&#xD;
"Very well, Miss be Montfort. Consider it&#xD;
a settled matter."&#xD;
I will, Sir; and let me assure you I am&#xD;
happy and grateful."&#xD;
"Speak no more of gratitude, dear young&#xD;
lady. There is a reciprocal pleasure im dis&#xD;
matter. F.rst, I have the pleasure of doing&#xD;
nhat she esteems a favor for tre daughter of an&#xD;
old and valued friend. Next, I h ive the great&#xD;
pleasure to advance an old, tried, and very faith-&#xD;
ful employee of our firm to a position where his&#xD;
salary will be increased. And you will earn all&#xD;
of the salary which we give. So, after all, you&#xD;
see that it is I who am obhliged. Now, say no&#xD;
more. Let me order you a glass of wine, and&#xD;
then, though at this early hour my wife and&#xD;
daughters are in their neglige, let me call and&#xD;
introduce them to you."&#xD;
"Many thanks, dear Sir; but please excuse&#xD;
me from introductions this morning. When I&#xD;
get settled, 1 will but too gladly meet-Mrs.&#xD;
Winter and your daughters. But now I feel&#xD;
too excited to see any one."&#xD;
"Well, as you please, my good young friend.&#xD;
I will look for you at the counting-house to-&#xD;
morrow !"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
In one of those low-roofed, shattered, time-&#xD;
and-dirt begrimed buildings on the   Point",&#xD;
which have long been an eye-sore to the better&#xD;
class of Baltimoreans-a building even scanned&#xD;
suspiciously by the police when in force they&#xD;
visited its locality (tor single policemen never&#xD;
ventured there), a very select party assembled&#xD;
together, some two or three weeks after Sadia&#xD;
had commenced her not arduous duties in the&#xD;
counting-house of Winter &amp;amp; Co.&#xD;
Select, I say ; for there can be " selections" of&#xD;
the wretched and vicious, as well as of the ele-&#xD;
ganit and good-of the lower million as well as of&#xD;
the upper few.&#xD;
Perhaps a glance at the room and its furnish-&#xD;
ing may give the r adcr an idea of the character&#xD;
of the "select" whom we are about to intro-&#xD;
duce.&#xD;
f   In the first place, the room looked as if water&#xD;
had never been introduced within its smoke-&#xD;
blackened walls, or had moistened the dirt-cov-&#xD;
ered floor. Upon those sooty walls were hung&#xD;
- a variety of coarse and heavily-daubed litho-&#xD;
graphs of sundry prize-fighting scenes; and the&#xD;
e likenesses of various pugilists and some great&#xD;
- fighting-dogs-the last, in face, bearing marked&#xD;

SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
resemblance to their two-footed brethren in the&#xD;
brute line. A long wooden table stood in the&#xD;
middle of the room, whiich may have once been&#xD;
painted. But it would be hard to decide, through&#xD;
the coat of grease and dirt upon it. On either&#xD;
side of this table was a row of small heavy stools,&#xD;
about as cleanly as the table.&#xD;
In the corner of the room was a space parti-&#xD;
tioned off about waist-high to the dirty-faced&#xD;
and frowsy-haired woman who stood benind it,&#xD;
ready to dispense blue-ruin from sundry square&#xD;
bottles which were arranged behind her.  On&#xD;
the front of this (by courtesy) bar, were a dozen&#xD;
or less of these small' thick-bottomed glasses,&#xD;
always to be found in groggeries where the cus-&#xD;
tomers generally try to get the worth of their&#xD;
money, so to sj'eak, by taking a glass full of grog&#xD;
whenever they drink.&#xD;
At this time, one of the square bottles was on&#xD;
the table aforementioned, as were several of the&#xD;
tumblers described ; and seated on either side&#xD;
of the same were six men, whose locks as well&#xD;
as dress would have signified to a detective, or&#xD;
any person well posted on city-characters, that&#xD;
they were desperadoes, to say the least. Men&#xD;
who understood the science of garroting ; could&#xD;
open a store or a bank with no other capital&#xD;
than a crowbar, a brace and bits, or a set of skel-&#xD;
eton-keys; could play a fair or a foul game of&#xD;
cards as necessi'y or pleasure demanded, and&#xD;
who would think about as little of taking human&#xD;
life as they would of killing a rat. Men who&#xD;
were the Pariahs or Ishmaels of society, whose&#xD;
bands were against all men, and against whom&#xD;
all men could not but be.&#xD;
These men, who were drinking and talking, by&#xD;
their conversation showed that they expected&#xD;
somebody. And wrho that "somebody" was, be&#xD;
came very evident when, with hearty words of&#xD;
pleasure, they hailed the incoming of one of our&#xD;
old acquaintances-no less a personage than&#xD;
Carl Michel.&#xD;
lIe was so disguised with a wig of long and&#xD;
busby-black hair, and with his own gray beard&#xD;
and mustache completely dyed black, that no&#xD;
one except those rho had been very intimate&#xD;
with him, and who knew every scar dn his war-&#xD;
scathed figure-hea 1, would have recognized him&#xD;
by sight. But his voice, his accent, the pecu-&#xD;
liarity of his idiom, or broken English, could&#xD;
not be mistaken by any one who had ever heard&#xD;
him talk.&#xD;
"Hurrah for Captain Charlie !" cried the men&#xD;
at the table, when lie entered. "Hurrah for the&#xD;
bold King of the Chesapeake ! Hurrah, old boy'!&#xD;
you look like a peacock !"&#xD;
" Ah, shentilmen, you do me much honare !"&#xD;
cried Michel, advancing and bowing with that&#xD;
grace which seems to be the natural gift of a&#xD;
Frenchman.    "I am very proud to meet wiz&#xD;
such a select conpanie! I'ave shust come from&#xD;
ze gran' Confederacie, and I shall go back, I&#xD;
hope, very soon, wiz one bon cargo of sings zat&#xD;
&#xD;
are very necessaire zere, and for which w shall&#xD;
receive ze gold, l'argcnt1l'&#xD;
"Good - good !" cried one of the party.&#xD;
"That's the article we go in for, and must and&#xD;
will have one way or another !"&#xD;
" Certainement! A shentilmen wizout money&#xD;
is like ze goose wizout its fezzares ; or like ze&#xD;
enshine wizout ze steam, or ze cart wizout ze&#xD;

"Good, that's the idea! ' Won't you flood&#xD;
your gullet, old boy?'&#xD;
"I sank you; I sail not object to take some-&#xD;
sing for drink, if it is strong!''&#xD;
"You'll find it that. You'know we're all sworn&#xD;
against the use of water in drmnkable shape !"&#xD;
"Eli bien ! I have been of zat persuasion zis&#xD;
forty year !" cried Michel, as he took a stool&#xD;
and filled a glass from the bottle.&#xD;
" Give us a toast, old boy ; give us a toast !"&#xD;
cried one of the most hilarious of the )arty.&#xD;
"Ah, sare-you    do me much houare! I&#xD;
propose for one sentiment-let ime se", I must&#xD;
reflect ! I give you. slientilmens, ourselves, one&#xD;
very select companies "&#xD;
"Hurrah for Charlie, and   hurrah for his&#xD;
toast !" cried all hands, and with clashing&#xD;
glasses the toast was drank.&#xD;
"And now, shentilmen, what about bizness !&#xD;
Is ze schooner engage ?"&#xD;
"Yes; bought and paid for, and a Bay trad-&#xD;
ing license got out, with capital security on the&#xD;
straw-bail system !"&#xD;
"Eh bien-so far, so good! Ze crew ?"&#xD;
"\We are your crew. You are Captain ; Dane&#xD;
Terry there is mate, and the rest of us are deck-&#xD;
hands and cabin passengers. We will use this&#xD;
crib when we're ashore, and Moll Swipes there&#xD;
behind the bar has agreed to cook for us&#xD;
aboard, and tend here when we're ashore !"&#xD;
" Eh bien ! Zat is one very fine arrangement&#xD;
-very fine! We have one very select crew.&#xD;
What name is ze schoonare 7"&#xD;
"The Coquette !"&#xD;
" Eb bien-zat is one very good name. She&#xD;
will coquette wizze Yankees and flirt wiz ze Con-&#xD;
federats! Haha-one verygood name! Where&#xD;

"Down at the basin, with one of our sort on&#xD;

"Good-good everysing! Ze next sing is for&#xD;

Hurrah for that.  You tell us what you&#xD;
want done, and we'll do it, or break our necks&#xD;
in trying !"&#xD;
"Eli bien, shentilmen-it is very right. I&#xD;
shall 'ave plenty of somesing for you to do very&#xD;

SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Talk it out, Captain-talk it out, and con-&#xD;
sider us on hand for anything but lifting a saw-&#xD;
mill and carrying the water-power along !"&#xD;
" Zis mattare is not so difficult as zat !" said&#xD;
Michel, with a laugh. "I wish much to find&#xD;
a young lady zat leave Washington for zis citie&#xD;
a few days some time ago. She 'ave wiz her&#xD;
one leetel brozzare and one leetel sistare. And&#xD;
beside one old niggare name-sacre, what sacri-&#xD;
lege ! name Napoleon! and one woman niggare&#xD;
named Syntia ! She come here to live, and I&#xD;
must find out where she live !"&#xD;
"Ah, ah-got matrimony in your eye-you&#xD;
intend to get married, eh Captain l" asked one&#xD;
of the party.&#xD;
"No, no-not zat !" said Michel, shrugging&#xD;
up his shoulders. "If ever I get marry, i shall&#xD;
take one weedow zat I loaf very much at Rich-&#xD;
mond-one rishe widow, who is very superbe ;&#xD;
very elegant. I wish to find zis young ladee&#xD;
because I can make plenty of money, if I can&#xD;
get her as far as Richmond! Zere is a shentil-'&#xD;
man zere zat will give 'plenty of l'argent for her,&#xD;
for from him she 'ave run away. He is one&#xD;
officare in ze Confederacie!"&#xD;
"What's her name? We'll find her out if she's&#xD;
above ground in the city !" said one of the men.&#xD;
"Mademoiselle Sadia De Montfort was her&#xD;
name when she 'ave leave her friends. I do not&#xD;
eink she will use any ozzare name."&#xD;
" Good-we'll be on the look-out for her.&#xD;
Take another drink, Captain! You don't shove&#xD;
the glass as fast as you used to !"&#xD;
"Ah, shentilmen-you see I 'ave much biz-&#xD;
ness upon my mind now. I will drink one glass,&#xD;
and zen go to see my friends to prepare for ze&#xD;
cargo!"&#xD;
And the Captain drank a glass, then bowing,&#xD;
retired amid the applause of the miscreant gang,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
Sadia sat in the neat little parlor of the house&#xD;
of Mrs. Meredith, where she boarded, gazing&#xD;
with quiet pleasurqe upon her brother and sis-&#xD;
ter, who were engaged in looking over a couple&#xD;
of illustrated books which she had bought at&#xD;
Taylor's that afternoon, and brought home to&#xD;
them. There was not now a cloud upon her&#xD;
bright and joyous face ; her salary, with what&#xD;
she had brought from home, had enabled her&#xD;
to live independently, though frugally, and to&#xD;
purchase many neat little presents for those&#xD;
whom she so loved.&#xD;
She had taken her guitar up to play one of'&#xD;
her favorite fantasias; but the noisy happiness&#xD;
of the children so pleased her, that she did not&#xD;
touch its chords, but remained attracted by the&#xD;
scene at which she was gazing.&#xD;
So intent was she in this, that she did not see&#xD;
old Napoleon, when, hat in hand, he Entered the&#xD;
room; and he, seeing her so much engaged, did&#xD;
not intrude himself upon her, but waited until&#xD;
she should herself notice him.&#xD;
&#xD;
63&#xD;
&#xD;
At last she raised her eyes and saw him, and&#xD;
with a smile, said :&#xD;
"Ah, you here, Napoleon! Is there anything&#xD;
I can do for you?"&#xD;
"Nuffin for me, Miss Sady, muffin for me !&#xD;
But dere's sumfin on my mind dat I can't keep&#xD;
in. I tole it to my Cynthy, and she tole me to&#xD;
jess come straight an' tole it to you, Miss&#xD;
Sady!t"&#xD;
Well, what is it, Napoleon ?"&#xD;
"I's afeard, Miss Sady, dat some o' dem Se-&#xD;
cesh main to play you wicked trick. Dey is&#xD;
jess mean enough for do anyting ! You knows&#xD;
dat without my say in' so !"&#xD;
"Why, do you thirk any one means me harm,&#xD;
Napoleon ?"&#xD;
"'Cause dis, Miss Sady, more'n a dozen times&#xD;
lately I've seen some hard-lookin' white cases&#xD;
loafin' around here an' a watchin' you when you&#xD;
was a goin' out and a coming' in. An' dey seem&#xD;
to look hard at me and Cynthy, too. An' de&#xD;
odder day one ob 'em stop me and says, he :&#xD;
'Snowball! whar you come from?'     He was&#xD;
white folks, an' I didn't like to say what I wanted&#xD;
to ; so I touch my hat and say dat wasn't my&#xD;
name, and I come away quick, so as I shouldn't&#xD;
get mad an' be sassy wid him. An' to-day dat&#xD;
same chap met me when I was down to de mar-&#xD;
ket for Missy Mer'dith, an' he say, 'here you&#xD;
Springlan' darkey, how's Miss Montfort, ehi?'&#xD;
Golly, I was so scare dat I didn't say nuffin, an'&#xD;
I run all de way right home here, and tole Cyn-&#xD;
thy, an' she made me come an' tole you !"&#xD;
"We may be watched by some of the. emis-&#xD;
saries of my brother or cousin," said Sadia,&#xD;
thoughtfully: "But they can do us no harm&#xD;
here, Napoleon. There is a strong military&#xD;
guard in and about the city, and far too many&#xD;
Union people in it, too, for any one to dare to&#xD;
injure us!"&#xD;
"Dem Secesh jess like snakes, Miss Sady-&#xD;
jess like snakes. Dey is a hidin' away, an' you&#xD;
doesn't know whar dey is till you come righton.&#xD;
'em! I doesn't like dem fellows a pokin' around&#xD;
no way, and if dey wasn't white folks Pd show&#xD;
'em what Springland muscle was -dat's so!&#xD;
And if dey come a foolin' round in de dark, dey&#xD;
may find out dat dis c'ile is s'prisin' blind in&#xD;
de night, 'specially when he wants to be !"&#xD;
"You must be careful, Napoleon! You&#xD;
know how it would distress me if you were in-&#xD;
jured. And you must keep in after dark. You&#xD;
need not be alarmed for me, I assure you. Re-&#xD;
member that I always have a revolver near me,&#xD;
either in my pocket, or where I can reach it.&#xD;
And I have good and powerful friends here--&#xD;
friends who will not allow me to be harmed !"&#xD;
"Yes, I know, Miss Sady ; but I hasn't done&#xD;
nuffin wrong, 'cause I tole you, has I?"&#xD;
"Oh, no! I thank you, Napoleon, for your&#xD;
watchfulness and kindness. Go and caution&#xD;
Cynthia to be careful and not go out after dark,&#xD;
Ah! I see Mr. Winter coming! I will tell him&#xD;

what you have seCen. Yotu can go, now, Na-&#xD;
poleon."&#xD;
The old negro bowed respectfully, and went&#xD;
out by the side door, just as the princely mer-&#xD;
chant entered at the front.&#xD;
"I called in, Miss Sadia," he said in a friendly&#xD;
tone, "merely to say that which in business-&#xD;
hours totally escaped my mind. M: wife asked&#xD;
me this morning to say to you that she would&#xD;
have a few friends to tea this evening, who would&#xD;
spend the evening with us, and she wihed me&#xD;
particularly to press you to be one of her visit-&#xD;
ors on the occasion. Say that you will come,&#xD;
and our carriage shall call for you."&#xD;
"You need not eend the carriage, for you&#xD;
know the cars pass very near your hose, Mr.&#xD;
Winter. But 1 will go with sincere pleasure,&#xD;
for the kindness I mett in 'our house always&#xD;
make me feel hapyiv and at borne. But please&#xD;
to sit down for a moment, I have something to&#xD;
tell you. Napoleon has got quite alarmed&#xD;
\ about something, and I wish to tell you what he&#xD;
says."&#xD;
Mr. Winter sat down ; and Sadia, who had&#xD;
long before told hini the history of her perse-&#xD;
cutions and escape, now related what Napoleon&#xD;
had told her.&#xD;
"There may be something in this !" said Mr.&#xD;
Winter, who bad listened attentively to the nar-&#xD;
ration. "A man who would force his attentions&#xD;
upon one who did iiot like him, would be guilty&#xD;
of any meanness, any treachery, any crime!B&#xD;
But do not be alarmed at my remark. I shall'&#xD;
take the ierty.of having a keen-eyed detective&#xD;
placed on the look-out, and I assume you that I&#xD;
do not exaggerate when I say that I feel as anx-&#xD;
ious for your saety as I would for that of one&#xD;
of my own daughters !"&#xD;
"I thank you, Sir ! But I thought it better&#xD;
to tell you of my servaiL'n discoveries and&#xD;
fears !"&#xD;
. "Yes, surely! And I shall send the carriage&#xD;
for you this evening. and see you safely home&#xD;
myself! io words my de.ar child-no words,&#xD;
for I will have my own way. You have no&#xD;
father now but me, )}ou know' "&#xD;
"But, Sir, I give you too much trouble-&#xD;
trouble that i unnecessary, too, it seems ."&#xD;
'-Let me he the judge of that, my dear friend&#xD;
-let me he the jioe'of that!" said Mr. Win-&#xD;
ter, in a kid tone. 'My wife and daughters&#xD;
feel quite as much interest m you as if you&#xD;
were one of our own family !"&#xD;
"I am very grateful to them and you, Sir;&#xD;
and I assure you that such kindness makes me&#xD;
almost forget that I.ain an exile !"&#xD;
"Do not speak of that. how are your broth-&#xD;
er and sister "&#xD;
"Very well, Sir, and very good and studious.&#xD;
Marion is beginning to be quite a little man !"&#xD;
"I am glad to hear it. But I must hurry&#xD;
away. *Good afternoon! "&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
The reader who considers our gr at riurtherzt&#xD;
lakes mere mil-ponds, or an almost land-locked&#xD;
bay, like the Cbesapi eake, not dangerous, both&#xD;
as compliared with the aluiost boundless ocean,&#xD;
had better take a tri  on either or both of the&#xD;
first-named, and txp(rence a good rousing gale&#xD;
thereon. If the rolling ground-sea or swell,&#xD;
white-capped and literally nmounn tahLigh, and&#xD;
the fearful perils of a ce shore don't roll and&#xD;
scare the idea out of his niind, then my dozen&#xD;
y ears of sea-experienco s, beside some " tall&#xD;
weather" seen on the waters first alluded to,&#xD;
may go for nothing, and you may mark ma&#xD;
donn as a land-lubber n ho don't know a clew&#xD;
garnet from a man-to-bowliue, or a buntlino&#xD;
froi a spanker out-hand.&#xD;
And this is only prefatory to a scene of act-&#xD;
ual occurrence inthe early part of the present&#xD;
Rebelnion, or rather, to a description of that&#xD;
scene.&#xD;
The promise of the IIon. (?) Mr. Mallory to&#xD;
give Lieut  nant Beverly a separate command&#xD;
as soon as possible, was speediri fulfilled by the&#xD;
Confederate Naval Secetary ; for only a few&#xD;
weeks alter the Imeeti:t. of the Lieutenant with&#xD;
Michel in the streets of liclmlaond, the former&#xD;
was r believed from his secondary position on&#xD;
board of the " Exterminator", on the James&#xD;
River, and ordered to take charge cf another&#xD;
gunboat on the York River, of a ihke construe-&#xD;
:tion, armament, and size, known as the " Bea-&#xD;
gle", with similar orders in regard to watching&#xD;
and annoying* such daring Yankees as ap-&#xD;
proached the Conifderate bounds by sea or&#xD;
land, within reach of his guns.&#xD;
On the afternoon when the scene occurred to&#xD;
which this chapter is devoted, Lieutenant-Corn-&#xD;
mandiing Beverly had run his boat down to the&#xD;
very mouth of the river to see if any cruisers&#xD;
were off in the Bay, as lie said. But well ie&#xD;
might know that he would finid none there ; for&#xD;
no ves-el would remain upon the Ceesapeake&#xD;
which could find a harbor in such a gale as&#xD;
was then blowig, without she was scudding for&#xD;
an open sea in the broad Atlantic, which she&#xD;
might do, for the wind was LIon;ing directly&#xD;
down the Bay. Another gunboat was in com-n&#xD;
pany, and it seemed as if one captain wished&#xD;
to out-do the other in stearming, vei in that&#xD;
liver, in such a wind and sea as existed.&#xD;
Beverly having run out ais far as he dared&#xD;
with his little tub df a boat, was about to order&#xD;
the helmsman to shift her course up the Iiver,&#xD;
when his eye rested for a moment on the white&#xD;
but scanty canvas of two vessels which seemed'&#xD;
to be scudding down the Bay, both well in on&#xD;
the western shore w here he was.&#xD;
lie called for his telescope, ordering tho&#xD;
helmsman to ring for the engineer to run slow ;&#xD;
and while lie was looking at the vessels, a cloud&#xD;
of white smoke was seen to spm ing from the&#xD;
bow of the sternmost one, and soon after, the&#xD;
&#xD;
SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
dull report of a distant gun came faintly down&#xD;
upon the wind.&#xD;
"By Jove, there's some fun afloat' away&#xD;
there. " be cried, and he directed the engineer&#xD;
to keep just speed enough on the boat to make&#xD;
steerage-way, so that he could observe what&#xD;
was going on outside. And as the other gun-&#xD;
boat came up near him, he hailed her com-&#xD;
mander, who was his junior, and called his at-&#xD;
tention to the vessels advised him to lay by and&#xD;
see what was up.&#xD;
Meantime the two vessels eame on almost as&#xD;
swiftly as the clouds above them, soon showing&#xD;
themselves to be schooners of clipper-build.&#xD;
The character of the sternmost one in a&#xD;
short time was evident, as seen through Bev-&#xD;
erly's glass. She exhibited at her peak the&#xD;
Revenue fly, of the  united States. The other,&#xD;
evidently t[ ing to escape from the first, which&#xD;
had fired several shots to try to bring her to,&#xD;
showed no flag. That she was either a smug-&#xD;
gler or in some way an evader of the custom&#xD;
laws, was evident from the pertinacity of the&#xD;
pursuer.&#xD;
Of course, the officers and crews of the Rebel&#xD;
gunboats took a deep interest in the fate of the&#xD;
vessel which was being pursued; and, doubtless,&#xD;
if there had been no such fearful risk as there&#xD;
was in running outside then, they would have&#xD;
put off to throw the weight of their guns&#xD;
against the United Etatcs cruiser.&#xD;
On--oncame the two vessels-neither of&#xD;
diem showing more than close-reefed fore-and-&#xD;
aft sails ; both seeming almost to bound from&#xD;
sea to sea o er the short but fearfully-heavy&#xD;
waves.&#xD;
As they neared the mouth of the river, Bev-&#xD;
rly noticed that the leading schooner was evi-&#xD;
dently head ing in toward the laud ; and by way&#xD;
of encouragement to her if she should happen&#xD;
to be favora'le to the Confederate cause, as she&#xD;
would be moat probably if a smuggler, he had&#xD;
the stars and triple bars raised upon his flag-&#xD;
staff, and the long iron thirty-two pounder on&#xD;
his forward deck was fired.&#xD;
The Schooner gave almost instant signs of&#xD;
recogni ion ; for in less than a minute the Rebel&#xD;
flag fluttered from the gaff, and she headed for&#xD;
he river as directly as possible.&#xD;
The revenue-cutter still kept desperately on,&#xD;
firing every f w moments, as if endeavoring to&#xD;
carry away tihe spars of the other craft, so as to&#xD;
disable her Lut the sea was so rough and&#xD;
heavy that the shots all fell wild, and it seem-&#xD;
ed as if the craw which carried the Rebel flag&#xD;
could not but escape.&#xD;
On--on they came-the schooners seemingly&#xD;
not a half mile apart, until Beverly thought&#xD;
t-at the cutter had come within his range.&#xD;
Ordering his thirty-two pounder loaded care-&#xD;
fully with a single round shot, he sighted it&#xD;
himself, and pulled the lanyard of the gun.&#xD;
&#xD;
Exultingly, he saw that the shot threw p the&#xD;
spray close aboard the cutter.&#xD;
His consort, similarly armed, tried her hand&#xD;
at a shot, and came even closer than Beverly&#xD;
had.&#xD;
And the commander of the cutter, seekig the&#xD;
odds too great, now that he was coming under&#xD;
the fire of vessels which-tay in smooth water,&#xD;
took in his foresail, and suddenly hauling u&#xD;
on a wind, discontinued the chase, venting his&#xD;
rage,nhowever, in a broadside, which sent a half-&#xD;
dozen holes through the canvass of the fugi-&#xD;
tive, and knocked away her main-topma.t.&#xD;
But the damage to the sails cane too late;&#xD;
and while the cutter, lying down gunwale un-&#xD;
der in the gale, clawed off shore, the other&#xD;
schooner came sweeping into the sooth water&#xD;
of the river, with the Rebel rag flyingtaunthwg&#xD;
ly from her gaff.&#xD;
"What vessel is that ?" shouted Beverly&#xD;
through his trumpet, as the schooner hanged up&#xD;
within hail.&#xD;
"Ze schoonare Coquette, Captain Carl Mi-&#xD;
chel, Sare, at your bon service, wiz one very se-&#xD;
lect cargo for ze grand Confederacie !" shouted&#xD;
a well -known voice.&#xD;
"Heave to, Michel-heave to, my old friend.&#xD;
I wish to see you!" eried Beverly, instantly&#xD;
recognizing the Frenchman.&#xD;
"Sacre! Is zat you, Messie'ir Beverly?&#xD;
By darn I am more glad to see you z in I was to&#xD;
get away from   zat Yankee zat 'ave chase&#xD;
me so very close. She was more big zani me,&#xD;
and came more close zan I like-she was more&#xD;
fast zan I, and if you 'ave not speak w z your&#xD;
big guns when you do, by ze whale zat Jonah&#xD;
eat, I sink zat I shall be one prize for hiii!"&#xD;
cried Michel, as he put his htln dwh and&#xD;
rounded to close alongside of the steamer. "I&#xD;
will be wiz you very soon-so quick as my men&#xD;
put down one boat. I have some grand infor-&#xD;
macione for you from Baltinore ! continued&#xD;
Michel, as he gave orders for his men to haul&#xD;
up the fore-sail, draw the jib-sheet to windward,&#xD;
and to put the helm alee, trimming the main-&#xD;
sheet aft at the same time.&#xD;
In a few moments the schooner lay almost as&#xD;
still upon the water as if she had been at an-&#xD;
chor; for she was, in nautical parlance, hove to,&#xD;
and with but little drift, held her position.&#xD;
A boat was soon hoisted over the side, and&#xD;
manned with a crew of oarsmen, and into this&#xD;
Michel sprung with much more agility than he&#xD;
would have exhibited in mounting a horse.&#xD;
A few strokes of the oars and the boat was&#xD;
alongside of the steamer, where Beverly stood&#xD;
at the gangway o receive and welcome the sue- J&#xD;
ces ful smuggler.1&#xD;
"Come right down into my cabin, Captain !'&#xD;
said he, as he grasped the Frenchman's hand.&#xD;
"There I can hear all the news you have to.&#xD;
tell, and also learn how I can be "of service toY&#xD;
you. Aid I have some capital cogniac there !"&#xD;

"Bon. We will go zere, Sare, and zen I will&#xD;
tell you ze news from Baltimore !"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
The cabin of the Confederate States gunboat&#xD;
Beagle-was not very roomy-nor was it furnish-&#xD;
ed in a very enviable style of gorgeousness. It&#xD;
was a little den in the stern of the boat, not a&#xD;
foot larger than a wardroom stateroom in one&#xD;
of our magnificent sea-going frigates. But it&#xD;
sufficed to contain Lieutenant Beverly and his&#xD;
baggage, one portion of which was a liquor-&#xD;
case, full one-tenth as large as the trunk of a&#xD;
Saratoga belle, and that was of sufficient size to&#xD;
contain nearly a barrel of various imbibible&#xD;
beverages.&#xD;
Pointing Michel to one stool, Beverly took a&#xD;
seat on another, and took from his case a square&#xD;
bottle marked "old Cogniac", in gilded letters,&#xD;
and a couple of gilded glasses belonging to the&#xD;
ease. Placing them on the table, he filled the&#xD;
glasses, and then said:&#xD;
"Help yourself, friend Michel. Stand upon&#xD;
no ceremony here. There is some brandy, that&#xD;
I certify came from your own belle France.&#xD;
Help yourself, and oil the blocks of your talk-&#xD;
ing-tackle, so that you can give me the news&#xD;
more easily."&#xD;
"Ah, Messieur Beverly, you do me much&#xD;
honare. I drink wiz you and to you, and to ze&#xD;
bad luck of zat. Yankee euttare zat come so&#xD;
much too close to me and make ze peep-holes&#xD;
in my sails!"&#xD;
"Yes; and he would have made some holes&#xD;
in your hull, if our vessel hadn't been in the&#xD;
river, here !"&#xD;
" Zat is very probable, Messieur Beverly-&#xD;
very probable. As it is, you 'ave save one bon&#xD;
cargo of article zat will be very welcome in ze&#xD;
Confederacic. I have ze bowie-knife, ze revol-&#xD;
vare, ze powder, ze cap, de percussione, and ze&#xD;
whisky for ze shernilmens ; and for ze ladies ze&#xD;
silk, ze lace, ze ribbone, ze glove, ze hoop, se&#xD;
leetle shoe, and ze perfume, wiz evare so much&#xD;
more sings zat not now I can con sidare !"&#xD;
"Just what is needed, my dear fellow, and&#xD;
worth half a fortune. For, since the blockade,&#xD;
everything has gone up, asif the people thought&#xD;
they would never get any goods again."&#xD;
"So much ze bettare for my speculacione !"&#xD;
replied Michel, laughing. " Zis war will be like&#xD;
paradise for ze speculacione. Ze soldier will&#xD;
fight and get ze loss of leg and arm, and die,&#xD;
and all zat ; he will go down, but up will rise'&#xD;
se politician, and rishe, oh, very rishe, will&#xD;
grow ze sheutilmen who make ze speculacione !&#xD;
Zey are ze men for ze day. Ha, ha, zey are ze&#xD;
men for ze day !"&#xD;
Alas, how much truth in that!&#xD;
"Not for us, though !" said Beverly, with a&#xD;
laugh. "But you spoke of news from Balti-&#xD;
more !"&#xD;
"Oui, certainement, I did do zat. And it is&#xD;
&#xD;
news in which you are very much interest ! Ex.&#xD;
cuse me-I fill again my glass wiz zat bon cog-&#xD;
niac, and zen I tell you zat news&#xD;
Michel filled his glass, drank off about half&#xD;
its contents, and then said&#xD;
" Ze ladee-ze sistare of Messieur Warburton&#xD;
De Montfort-is in Baltimore!"&#xD;
" Ali! have you seen her ?"&#xD;
"No, Sare ; I did not wish for her to see me,&#xD;
for she 'ave seen me before, and it might not&#xD;
be comfortable for her to see me in Baltimore;&#xD;
at ze b st, it were bettare for me, for ze friend&#xD;
of ze Coufederacie have no sight zere now I&#xD;
But tree, four five of my men have see her, and&#xD;
zey have talk wiz ze two niggares, and ze broz-&#xD;
zare, and zesistare -"&#xD;
"What does she do; how does she live, and&#xD;
where ?"&#xD;
"You ask so much question at one time zat I&#xD;
not know which one to ansare at ze first. She&#xD;
have ze employment for write fur one very&#xD;

" Well, do you think that it is possible to get&#xD;
her away from Baltimore ? I will give five&#xD;
thousand dollars to get her in my power .1"&#xD;
" Wiz zat money, Messicur Beverly, zere is&#xD;

"Well, succeed my friend, succeed, and the&#xD;

"Au, zat is one good consideration. I do&#xD;

or eat by ze rat, or ze bank break, and zen it is&#xD;

"I can go up ze rivare wiz my schoonare,&#xD;

"Yes, there will be no trouble in that. I&#xD;
will give you a certificate which will pass you&#xD;

" Zen I shall go up ze rivare and sell my&#xD;

&#xD;
"The schooner? Why will you sell her ?"&#xD;
"Because it will nevare do for me to go to&#xD;
Baltimore wiz her again. And more, zis rivare&#xD;

where, zen I will get for my passengers ze&#xD;

"Your plan is good. That is, if you can&#xD;
manage to get the lady once on board without&#xD;
being discovered and foiled !"&#xD;
"Ah, you nevare mind but what I do zat. I&#xD;
was not born yesterday, or to-day, or to-mor-&#xD;
row-sacre no!/ When ze Yankees get before&#xD;
zis representative of ze old empire, zey are&#xD;

"Well I hope you will succeed! It will be&#xD;
a big feather in your cap when you do !"&#xD;
"I care not for ze fezzare ; but ze money, zat&#xD;
is what I like more !" said Michel, and again he&#xD;
sealed his alliance to la belle France in a glass&#xD;
of cognac.&#xD;
"And now, Messieur Beverly !" said he as he&#xD;
drained his glass, "I zink I will go on board ze&#xD;
Coquette and proceed up ze rivare ! I will&#xD;
Write to you when I am away, and tell you&#xD;

"Can you transmit letters easily and safe-&#xD;

" Oui-certainenent, I can. Ze mail is notJ&#xD;

"Indeed! yours will be a welcome arrivals&#xD;

"Very well, Michel, go ahead. I'll run up&#xD;
the river a ways with you, and if the wind dies&#xD;
away, perhaps I'll give you a tow."&#xD;
" Ah 0you are very much good, Messie&#xD;
Beverly. I shall not forget you-no Sare, not&#xD;
so long as I remembare. Your very good health,&#xD;
Sare, and au rcvoir-au rcvoir I"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
The author has refrained as long as possible&#xD;
from taking a close view of the inside world,&#xD;
where the patriotic man of business found his&#xD;
chief happiness; in other words, in the "bosom&#xD;
of his family", to quote an old way of speaking&#xD;
of a household. For Mr. Winter was not one of&#xD;
those sordid-hearted men whose whole thought&#xD;
is bent upon gain, and who looks at worthand&#xD;
pleasure only for what it is worth in currency.&#xD;
Now, circumstances make it necessary for a&#xD;
emporary intrusion into the happy circle.&#xD;
Mrs. Winter herself was one ofc those fine&#xD;
hearty-looking ladies whom we 'sometimes, but&#xD;
not often, meet, who, at fifty, do not look to be&#xD;
over thirty years of age. No care had furrow-&#xD;
ed her smooth brow, or brought slver threads&#xD;
among her dark brown tresses-no cosmetics&#xD;
were required upon her health-iuted and fault-&#xD;
less face. Her hazel eyes were alight with the&#xD;
glow of contentment and peace, and a smile of&#xD;
love and genial kindness made her ever look&#xD;
beautiful to those who loved her.&#xD;
Two daughters-one eighteen and the other&#xD;
three years older-had been raised entirely under&#xD;
her own eyes, educated at home, far from board-&#xD;
i-ug-school influences and city school conven-&#xD;
tionalities.&#xD;
With unlimited means placed at her com-&#xD;
maud, Mis. Winter had chosen the best teach-&#xD;
ers that money could procure for her daught-&#xD;
ers, and the consequence was, that young as&#xD;
they were, they were tuore elegantly as well as&#xD;
more substantially educated than  any other&#xD;
ladies in the Monumental City in their circle of&#xD;
society. They were not strictly handsome girls;&#xD;
but they were well formed, inore than ordinary-&#xD;
looking, very graceful and easy in carriage and&#xD;
deportment, and, more than all, thoroughly&#xD;
genteel.&#xD;
Used to the best society, they seemed un-&#xD;
conscious of any advau-tages whhie  the im-&#xD;
mense wealth of Mr. Winters might give them.,&#xD;
and exhibited none of w[ at I choose to call the&#xD;
ludicritics of parcenu aristocrace .&#xD;
And froiu the hour whea Mr. Winter first&#xD;
presented Sadia to these ladies, our heroine had&#xD;
been with them a decided favorite and an ever-&#xD;
welcome   isitor. Indeed, they had more thrn&#xD;
once striven hard to get her to accept the first -&#xD;
proposition of Mr. Winter, and to become a&#xD;
daughter and sister in the the house with them.&#xD;
But Sadia, with gentle and courteous ao-&#xD;

SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
knowledgments, preferred to remain in her in-&#xD;
dependent position, though a frequent inter-&#xD;
change of visits caused a most sisterly feeling to&#xD;
exist between her and the Winter girls.&#xD;
And it was to meet them and a few select&#xD;
friends at tea, and to spend a sociable evening,&#xD;
that Sadia was in' ited, as we have already inti-&#xD;
mated in a previous chapter. Sadia had spent&#xD;
such evenings there before, and they had ever&#xD;
been very agreeable. The class drawn to the&#xD;
house of Mr. Winter were not frivolous fashion-&#xD;
-  ables, who could talk of nothing but, the last&#xD;
party, or fashion, or indulge in nonsensical&#xD;
gossip ; they were not blues, or book-worms,&#xD;
but people of life and realty, who lived to enjoy&#xD;
life, and make and share pleasure as they moved&#xD;
along the roadpf destiny.&#xD;
The hour was early when the carriage of the&#xD;
merchant called upon Sadia, but she was ready&#xD;
--her elegant form, neatly, fashionably, but not&#xD;
extravagantly attired, and her lovely hair hang-&#xD;
ing in its natural curls down upon her white&#xD;
shoulders.&#xD;
At the door of Mr. Winter's house she was&#xD;
met by Carrie and Emma, the daughters whose&#xD;
welcome of kisses and kind glad words went&#xD;
pleasantly into the heart which they would not&#xD;
allow to feel desolate.&#xD;
And they hurried her up to their own room,&#xD;
and assisted her to arrange herself for the par-&#xD;
lor, affectionately acting all the time as if she&#xD;
was a sister rather than one but lately a strang-&#xD;
er, and altogether forgetful of the fact that she&#xD;
held a dependent position under the firm  of&#xD;
which her father was a member.&#xD;
" You must put on our prettiest face to-night,&#xD;
Belle Sadia-"'said Carrie, the youngest sist-r,&#xD;
while her laugh~ug blue eyes and sweetly dim-&#xD;
pled face seemed to beam with gleeful mischief-&#xD;
" there are t hree beaux below, real lions in their&#xD;
way-two of them   "shoulder-straps", and the&#xD;
other a young muan of excellent family and fine&#xD;
education, though he is only a sergeant!"&#xD;
"A hero for each of us, you see-" said Em-&#xD;
ma, laughing gayly-" two of them sailors and&#xD;
one a soldier. W hicli wil you have, Sadia ? As&#xD;
you are our guest, yon are entitled to the first&#xD;
choice, by every piuinciple of courtesy."&#xD;
Then you as the eldest, Miss Emma-must&#xD;
take the highest in rank-and Carrie as the pret-&#xD;
tiest, must take the next, of course. I will put&#xD;
up with the Sergeant for the evening, and check&#xD;
my ambition to be beaued by shoulder-straps !"&#xD;
said Sadia, joining in the merriment of the kind-&#xD;
hearted girls.&#xD;
"How magnanimous !" said Carrie, laughing&#xD;
"And how flattering to.poor me! Really, I&#xD;
must sit for a portrait in some picture-gallery,&#xD;
if I am better looking than you, Sadia!"&#xD;
"Well, youi'l have to wait daylight for that,&#xD;
at any-rate. Let us go down, girls. Mother&#xD;
has at least half a dozen to amuse, ladies and&#xD;
&#xD;
gentlemen included, and it is time we went to&#xD;
her relief!" said Emma.&#xD;
And the three girls went down to the parlor,&#xD;
where Sadia found some former acquaintances&#xD;
whom she had before met there, and was intro-&#xD;
duced in due form to the " lions", who had been&#xD;
discussed so recently up stairs.&#xD;
The first was a New Hampshire born lieuten-&#xD;
ant, whose peculiarities smacked both of granite&#xD;
and codfish, having been born on the hills of&#xD;
the first and having spent his youth in catching&#xD;
the second, or that poJrtion cf it at least which&#xD;
preceded his entrance into the Army. He had&#xD;
a tolerable form and a most ferocious mous.&#xD;
tache, of which he seemed very fond, for he&#xD;
was continually caressing it with his hand and&#xD;
twisting its wiry ends. lie was very conversa-&#xD;
tive-very patriotic, and very denunciative of&#xD;
everything Southern-a not very courteous mat.&#xD;
ter, when he was aguest to a Southerner, though&#xD;
a nobly loyal host.&#xD;
Salia was glad the moment after the intro-&#xD;
duction, that the up-stairs allotment, even jest&#xD;
as it was, had not assigned Lieutenant Bacon to&#xD;
her. For as a base coin can be detected from a&#xD;
genuine by the ring of the metal-so can a&#xD;
gentleman by birth, education, and principle, be&#xD;
quickly discerned, and his opposite in nature be&#xD;
as easily discovered.&#xD;
The next introduction, to Lieutenant Fulton,&#xD;
was far more agreeable to her; for he was not&#xD;
only very handsome and gentlemanly, well-d-&#xD;
ucated and graceful, but seemed to be utterly&#xD;
unconscious of having possessed of these favor.&#xD;
able qualities. Open-hearted, joy ful, and sailor-&#xD;
like, he was one calculated to please the fair sex.&#xD;
The third introduction was to Sergant Ar-&#xD;
miand,,and Sadia glanced half smilingly at the&#xD;
Winter girls, whon she received this introduc.&#xD;
tion, for she remembered that up stairs he was&#xD;
the one chosen at her "lion" for the occasion.&#xD;
And as she looked upon his pale face, and&#xD;
his left arm yet in a sling from a recent wound,&#xD;
her warni heart rose in a silent throb of syml-&#xD;
pamby-not that lie was in any way as a stran-&#xD;
ger more deserving   of sympathy than the&#xD;
others, but because, perhaps, her womanly feel-&#xD;
ings caused her to desire to show him the more&#xD;
attention, that his was the humblest rank of all.&#xD;
Yet his azure eye flashed as proudly, and his&#xD;
language was as courtly as that of any other&#xD;
person there, though his manner was especially&#xD;
subdued and unobtrusive.&#xD;
The conversation had scarcely become gen-&#xD;
eral in the parlor before the ringing of the tea-&#xD;
bell called the guests to the dining-room, where&#xD;
a well-set table had the place of the ' baby&#xD;
fashion" in some circles of. handing tea and&#xD;
cakes around. After an hour, more or less, had&#xD;
been rationally -no pun on rations intended, I&#xD;
assure you, dear reader-expended, the guests&#xD;
and family once more went back to tie parlors&#xD;
to enjoy the rest of the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
The "old folks", as they who are the oldest&#xD;
choose to style themselves, sat down to whis&#xD;
and chess; the younger gathered around the&#xD;
piano, where music, both vocal and-instrument&#xD;
al, lent its dulcet charms to add to the enjoy&#xD;
ment of all. Duets on the piano and guitar&#xD;
songs from each of the ladies, and some capital&#xD;
sea-pieces from Lieutenant Fulton followed, one&#xD;
upon the other, rapidly.&#xD;
And these were followed by dancing to music&#xD;
from the piano, in which all the young people&#xD;
participated except Armand, who made his dis-&#xD;
abled arm a very sufficient excuse for not join-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
Sadia, as soon as she could do so without at-&#xD;
tracting peculiar nz,tice, withdrew herself from&#xD;
the dancing party, and endeavored to amuse&#xD;
and interest the Sergeant. lie was, however,&#xD;
rather an enigma to her. lie seemed to en-&#xD;
deavor to avoid rather than to court conversa-&#xD;
tion. But she was determined to interest him,&#xD;
and to try to drive from his brow the shade of&#xD;
deep melancholy which seemed to be settled&#xD;
there.&#xD;
So she talked of war and glory, asked him&#xD;
many questions, and learned, after all, but little&#xD;
of that which she sought-his history, or the&#xD;
secret ofathe evident sadness which oppressed&#xD;
him. She only learned that patriotism only&#xD;
bound him to the service; for he had left luxu-&#xD;
ry and independence of fortune to join it-that&#xD;
he had been wounded in one of the first skirm-&#xD;
nshes of the war, and was about to rejoin his&#xD;
regiment, the     Cavalry, in Virginia, as his&#xD;
wound was rapidly healing, and he expected&#xD;
soon to be able to take the saddle.&#xD;
She knew that there was some sad secret&#xD;
gnawing at his very heart, and sympathetically&#xD;
she yearned to know the cause of his sorrow&#xD;
that she might strive to alleviate it; but maid-&#xD;
en delicacy would not permit direct question-&#xD;
;ngs, and he seemed all too reluctant to share&#xD;
his thoughts or griefs with another.&#xD;
Thus the evening passed ; and it was mid-&#xD;
night before the guests dreamed it was so late.&#xD;
And then, with many expressions of the plea-&#xD;
sure tvith which the evening had been passtl,&#xD;
they began to get ready to depart to their&#xD;
homes.&#xD;
Mr. Winter, as he had promised, had his car-&#xD;
riage ordered for Sadia, and got ready to see&#xD;
her home himself. The Lieutenants politely&#xD;
bade her good evening, and left. And Armand&#xD;
also came to thank her for her kind attention to&#xD;
him as an invalid, who could not join in the&#xD;
livelier festivities of the evening.&#xD;
"It is not likely that we shall ever meet again,&#xD;
Miss de Montfort, for I leave for the front in the&#xD;
morning ; but I hope this. Rebellion will soon&#xD;
be put down, the Union restored, and that you&#xD;
will recover the rights which you have been de-&#xD;
prived of." he said.&#xD;
I earnestly hope and pray that we may soon&#xD;
&#xD;
t have an honorable peace," she replied, "and&#xD;
t that you will be restored in health to those who&#xD;
e love you !"&#xD;
"Au, lady," said he, in a tone of utter sadness,&#xD;
- "love is a passion of which I may not ever&#xD;
dream.   Farewell !  God bless you!   Fare-&#xD;
l well !"&#xD;
And bowing his adieu to the others, he hur-&#xD;
ried away.&#xD;
: "how strangely lie acts, and how melancholy&#xD;
lie seems !" said Sadia, as, the moment after, Mr.&#xD;
- Winter offered his arm to escort her to the car-&#xD;
riage.&#xD;
o "Yes; he is quite misanthropical," said Mr.&#xD;
Winter. "And he has some cause ; matters&#xD;
known to me in confidence, which I cannot tell&#xD;
you of, but which do him no discredit. Ie has&#xD;
already rashly risked his life, and I fear will&#xD;
do it again. I feel interested in him, for I&#xD;
have had business with him, and have known&#xD;
him for some years. I had difficulty in getting&#xD;
him to spend the evening with us, but from ap-&#xD;
pearances he seemed to enjoy hiinself."&#xD;
"I pitied his apparent loneliness of feeling,&#xD;
and tried my best to amuse and interest him,"&#xD;
said Sadia. "I cannot bear to see any one sad,&#xD;
and if I could, I would shed sunshine into every&#xD;
human heart."&#xD;
"You are a good-hearted girl, Miss Sadia, and&#xD;
will yet make some masculine very happy,&#xD;
said Mr. Winter, with a laugh.&#xD;
"Or very wretched!" she rejoined, with a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
And then, in a moment, she added more se-&#xD;
riously.&#xD;
"I do not think that I shall ever go so far as&#xD;
to let the joy or misery of any man be depend-&#xD;
ent upon my whims. I have made up my mind&#xD;
to become that most horrible of terrors, an old&#xD;
maid-that is, if I live to age."&#xD;
"That, my dear young lady, may not be a&#xD;
discretionary matter with yourself. Love is a&#xD;
strange creature ; like the winds, he goeth where&#xD;
he -listeth, and those who most boast of their in-&#xD;
vulnerability are as apt to be wounded as any&#xD;
others.  One of these days, when Fortune's&#xD;
smiles begin again to beam upon your path, we&#xD;
will see you with the bridal wreath upon your&#xD;
brow."&#xD;
'It may be, but much I doubt it," said Sadiae&#xD;
with a smile, as at that moment the carriage&#xD;
drew up before the door of her boarding-house.&#xD;
The merchant saw her safely in, and bidding&#xD;
her good-night, was driven back to his own resi-&#xD;
dence.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
The business in which Mr. Winter and his&#xD;
firm was engaged-not the importing, but the&#xD;
wholesale part of it--threw him in very fre-&#xD;
quent contact with United States officers, nuk&#xD;
ing him acquainted with many of them, i&#xD;
various branches of service, in consequence of&#xD;

SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
ftrm often having contracts to fill with the Gov-&#xD;
era meant.&#xD;
One.of these acquaintances of his-rather a&#xD;
favorite, too, for his sterling honesty and loy-&#xD;
alty, as welt'as his never-failing humor-was a&#xD;
Captain in the Revenue service whose name&#xD;
was O'Dougal, a rather odd combination of the&#xD;
Gael and the Celt, which he accounted for in&#xD;
this way. His father was a Dougal, of the&#xD;
Douglas clan, and he fell in love with a North&#xD;
of Ireland lassie whose father claimed a descent&#xD;
from an ancient Milesian king. And though&#xD;
he, Mr. O'l3allyhack, owned but a poor shanty,&#xD;
a pig, a cow, and a potato-patch, he would not&#xD;
let Dougal have the princess, his daughter,&#xD;
until he consented to put the monarchical "0"&#xD;
before his name. And thus came the name of&#xD;
O'Dougal to this country, for the Captain's&#xD;
father emigrated soon after his marriage and&#xD;
became a democratic sovereign in his own right&#xD;
on American soil.&#xD;
His son, well educated here and aided by&#xD;
political influence, got a place in the Revenue&#xD;
service here, and in it became a valuable and&#xD;
efficient officer. And he combined the shrewd-&#xD;
ness of his father's nation with the wit of that&#xD;
of his mother; and though he had none of the&#xD;
brogue, had all the fun of a regular "wil-d&#xD;
Irishman."&#xD;
" Ah, how do you do, Captain, just in from a&#xD;
cruise ?" asked Mr. Winter, one morning as he&#xD;
met the worthy 0 Dougal at the door of his&#xD;
counting-house.&#xD;
"Under the weather in heart, but above it in&#xD;
body Mr. Winter, thank you," replied the Cap-&#xD;
tain.&#xD;
-Ah, down in the heart; what is the matter&#xD;
there ?" asked Mr. Winter, pleasantly.&#xD;
"The loss of something that I almost had-&#xD;
but didn't get! Don't laugh when I say I lost&#xD;
what I never had, but lay that to the Irish half&#xD;
of my extraction!"&#xD;
"I'll not laugh till the laughing part comes&#xD;
in !" said Mr. Winter, with a smile. "But -let&#xD;
me know your trouble, Captain. By the way,&#xD;
come up stairs to my private office, and over a&#xD;
glass of old sherry you can tell me more easily,&#xD;
perhaps!"&#xD;
"Thank you, Sir, I'll go up with you, not for&#xD;
the wine but after you are at leisure, to see you&#xD;
about some business-matters," said the Captain,&#xD;
following the old merchant to the cozy private&#xD;
office, or Throm, where he generally saw his&#xD;
business friends.&#xD;
After being seated and taking a glass of old&#xD;
Amontillado, O'Dougal, at the request of Mr.&#xD;
Winter, told his trouble.&#xD;
"You see, Sir," said he, "one of the Govern-&#xD;
ment detectives had been on the watch of a&#xD;
party for quite a time that had been loading a&#xD;
schooner, he thought, with the intent to run&#xD;
our blockade, and supply the Rebels below. He&#xD;
kept his information very much to himself&#xD;
&#xD;
though, only telling me enough to keep me on&#xD;
the alert, and ieady to start out and catch the&#xD;
fellows in transitu, as the law-peddlers have it.&#xD;
Well, so matters went, the detective begging&#xD;
me not to leave port with my cutter, for I was&#xD;
sure to make a hundred-thousand dollar haul,&#xD;
out of which, with a detective's usual modesty,&#xD;
of course, he expected a 'lion's' share. I be-&#xD;
gan almost to think somebody had been 'sell-&#xD;
ing' him, or that he was 'selling' me, the fellow&#xD;
being so very ion-communicative ; when last&#xD;
Sunday night, just after dark, when we were&#xD;
lying outside all the shipping at our anchor, he&#xD;
came aboard in a shore-boat in a thundering&#xD;
hurry, and told me that the schooner was off, as&#xD;
sure as fate.&#xD;
"It was blowing terribly fresh from the north&#xD;
and westward them. I told him no vessel had&#xD;
gone down the channel past us, for it was not&#xD;
so dark but what we could see white canvas in&#xD;
that naripw channel.&#xD;
" Ie told me that the schooner had not hoist-&#xD;
ed sail, but had drifted down inside of us with&#xD;
the ebb tide. He had seen her do so himself,&#xD;
and had been bothered to death to find a boat&#xD;
and crew to bring him off to the cutter to let us&#xD;
know.&#xD;
"Taking his word for it, I got the butter un.&#xD;
der way, and stood down the bay, keeping hee&#xD;
under as much canvas as I thought any sensi-&#xD;
ble man would carry, and running down thi&#xD;
Rebel side of the bay.&#xD;
"During the night we saw nothin-g; but when&#xD;
day broke, we made out a schooner ahead of u-,&#xD;
which the detective at once swore was the one&#xD;
he had 'spotted'. On this, I put all the can-&#xD;
vas on the cutter that her spars would bear,&#xD;
cleared away my 'Long Tom', and got ready to&#xD;
let the gentleman ahead know that I wanted to&#xD;
have a chat with him. But when I made sail&#xD;
he also began to pile on the canvas,.and in a&#xD;
little while we both had on all and more than&#xD;
sensible men ought to cirry. That satisfied&#xD;
me that he was what the detective thought him&#xD;
to be, and when, after a steady telescopic obser-&#xD;
vation of thirty minutes or more, I found that&#xD;
I was slowly but surely gaining on him, i slap-&#xD;
ped my hand on my pocket, and said to my-&#xD;
self:&#xD;
"' O'Dougal, you can indulge yourself in a&#xD;
demijohn of the old "Mnountain dew" when you&#xD;
get back, and make Mrs. OD. haopy with a new&#xD;
dress for herself, and ditto for'the youngster&#xD;
that's to carry the name high in the next gen-&#xD;
eration.'&#xD;
"And I went so far as to bid my first Luff&#xD;
keep a close eye on the chase, while I and the&#xD;
detective went below to examine the quality of&#xD;
some .ld Jamaica that had got into my state-&#xD;
room by some accident or other. For I felt&#xD;
contented. The old cutter has the heels of&#xD;
pretty nearly everything that carries cotton&#xD;
duck on spars, and I was sure we should have&#xD;
&#xD;
SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
the hundred-thousand-dollar gentleman along-&#xD;
side before many hours.&#xD;
" .Well, we examined the Jamaica once or&#xD;
twice, and then went on deck. The chase was&#xD;
losing ground, and I was well satisfied that she&#xD;
was as good .As ours. We had breakfast, and&#xD;
kept on the gain until the craft was nearly in&#xD;
range of my gun. Seeing that she hauled in&#xD;
on the Southern shore rather too much to&#xD;
suit me, as I came up within range, and begin-&#xD;
ning to fear that. she might ship into some of&#xD;
the rivers or creeks on that side of the bay, I&#xD;
hgan to talk to her with my pivot-gun.&#xD;
"The shot. flew close to her, and I was cer-&#xD;
tain of crippling her, if she didn't heave to.&#xD;
The detective and myself were even counseling&#xD;
how the examination of her cargo was to be&#xD;
conducted, when all at once a round shot from&#xD;
an infernal heavy gun away in shore came&#xD;
plunging along, and almost reached us. Then&#xD;
the schooner ahead, which had shown no colors&#xD;
so far, ran up the Rebel flag, and on going up&#xD;
the rigging a few ratlines high, with my glass&#xD;
I saw that there were two infernal Rebel gun-&#xD;
boats lying in the mouth of York River. And&#xD;
as they were peppering away at me now with&#xD;
metal three times heavier than I had, I had no&#xD;
choice but to give up the chase, as the schooner&#xD;
was running right in for them. So I hauled my&#xD;
wind, gave the schooner a broadside that made&#xD;
her sails look like well-worn dish-rags, and got&#xD;
out of the way. And so I had my chase and&#xD;
my cruise for nothing, and my plans for the&#xD;
'mountain dew' and the gratification of Mrs.&#xD;
O'D. have all gone by the board. Now Im&#xD;
sure that's enough to put one's heart under the&#xD;
weather-isn't it Mr. Winter ?"&#xD;
It was a great disappointment, certainly,&#xD;
Captain, and I deeply sympathize with you.&#xD;
But you cannot always have fortune on your&#xD;
side-that is, good fortune. I hope you will&#xD;
have better luck nexttime. There is, doubtless,&#xD;
a large trade being carried on from here in that&#xD;
way, and if the Government does not take very&#xD;
severe measures it will increase. For love of&#xD;
money, I am sorry to say, in many hearts is&#xD;
stronger than patriotism."&#xD;
But, reader, we have somewhere else to go,&#xD;
aid as the Captain has told his story, we will&#xD;
leave him and the merchant to do their busi-&#xD;
ness in private.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
As the wind was such that his schooner could&#xD;
hold her course up the Yor'k River, with only&#xD;
an occasional tack to gain the weather-side of&#xD;
the channel, Michel, after leaving the gunboat&#xD;
of his friend Beverly, made sail up the river,&#xD;
intending to go, at least, as far as West Point,&#xD;
if possible ; for from that point a railroad com-&#xD;
munication with Richmond would enable him&#xD;
to sell his goods at a vast advantage. But he&#xD;
was obliged to heave to at various points; and&#xD;
&#xD;
the nature of his cargo being made known, the&#xD;
needful articles of whisky, arus, ammunition,&#xD;
boots and shoes, and quinine, found a ready and&#xD;
advantageous sale ; for, as yet, gold and silver&#xD;
were used plentifuly in the South, and Confed-&#xD;
federate currency, had not a very extensive&#xD;
circulation. The purchasers, of course, were&#xD;
mainly officers and soldiers of the Confederate&#xD;
Army. Once in a while, it is true, a planter&#xD;
along the river, near the military posts, hearing&#xD;
of the arrival, would come on board, and make&#xD;
a purchase ; but these visits were few and far&#xD;
between.&#xD;
Beverly went no further up the river than&#xD;
Yorktown; his orders keeping him further down&#xD;
the river, where it was necessary to watch the&#xD;
expected advance of Federal forces.&#xD;
Upon arriving at West Point, full ten days&#xD;
after he had entered the river, Michel found&#xD;
quite a body of Confederate cavalry, and was&#xD;
delighted to meet once more his friend, Colonel&#xD;
Stuart, and Major Warburton:de Montfort.&#xD;
"Ah, shentilmen !" said he, when he had,&#xD;
without much difficulty, persuaded them on&#xD;
board his vessel to partake of a sardine-and-&#xD;
cracker-and-cheese lunch, washed down with&#xD;
choice beverages-"ab, shentilmen! I 'ave seen&#xD;
one bon adventure. I vas chase by one Yan-&#xD;
kee-doodale revenue-cuttare so very close, zat&#xD;
for one time I sink, if ze diable not favore me,&#xD;
I shall be make one prisonare wizout doubt.. I&#xD;
feel very mad-very mad! But ze diable did&#xD;
not desert his favorite shild-no, shentilmen, no!&#xD;
I escape wiz ze skin of my teeth ! If Messieur&#xD;
Beverly had not been near wiz his gunboat, I&#xD;
sink ze Yankee-doodale would 'ave cotch me.&#xD;
Ab, bon fortune zat he was so near !-bon for-&#xD;
tune for me! But I shall repay him by and&#xD;
by. I shall get for him ze ladee zat none of&#xD;
you shentilmen could capture !"&#xD;
"Do you mean my sister ?" asked Warbur-&#xD;
ton. And then, as his face darkened nith an&#xD;
angry flush, he added: "I mean the one whom&#xD;
I'called sister, before she went among the in-&#xD;
fernal Yankees !"&#xD;
"I did mean Miss Montfort, Messicur War-&#xD;
burton !" said Michel, swallowing a sardine, and&#xD;
instantly giving it swimming depth in a half-&#xD;
tumbler of old Cognac.&#xD;
"Have you seen her? Do you know where&#xD;
she is ?" asked Warburton, eagerly.&#xD;
He found it hard to be so unnatural as to&#xD;
forget a sister.&#xD;
"I 'ave not seen her, Messieur de Montfort ;&#xD;
but any day for the last two weeks, I could 'ave&#xD;
see her, if I so desire. But I knew if she see&#xD;
me, zen she would suspect somesing wrong, or,&#xD;
at any matter, she would inform ze Yankee ofi-&#xD;
care zat I was zere ; so I did not go where I&#xD;
could see her or she could see me. But my&#xD;
mens zat I send for zat purpose, zey 'ave seen&#xD;
her-zey 'ave talk wiz ze niggaree-zey find out&#xD;

Yes, Sare ; she is in Baltimore."&#xD;
" What is she subsisting on?  She cannot&#xD;

"Ah! she is one very smart ladee !   She&#xD;
nevare will want for money zere."&#xD;
"What do you mean, Sir:?  You dare not&#xD;
for an instant couple dishonor. with my sister's&#xD;
name !" cried Warburton, springing to his feet.&#xD;
All of the brother was not yet lost, even ii&#xD;
his Confederate-ruined heart.&#xD;
" Mon Dieu-no! No, you mistake me, Mes-&#xD;
sieur Warburton !" cried Michel, startled by&#xD;
the wild and threatening look of Warburton.&#xD;
"I nevare speak, nor dream zat ze lady, your&#xD;
sistare, should be less honorable, less pure, less&#xD;
good as one angel! No, gare. When I say she&#xD;
want not for uoney, I mean zat she 'ave pro-&#xD;

"Yes-pardon me for wronging you with&#xD;
such a thought. But I don't know what the&#xD;
devil has got into me lately. I believe I'm&#xD;
suspicious of everybody, myself included !"&#xD;
"Zen take plenty of ze brandy, Messieur&#xD;
Warburton. Brandy make ze heart warm and&#xD;
ze brain free!"&#xD;
Too free for safety sometimes !" said Stuart,&#xD;
with a laugh. " Do you like your vessel better&#xD;
than my saddles, friend Michel ?"&#xD;
" Your saddells ! Ah, Colonel Stuart, were&#xD;
yon not my friend I should challenge you for&#xD;
fight wiz me, for even so much as say ze word&#xD;
zit remind me of ze trot-trot ! Nevare, Sare,&#xD;
will I again endure zat misery-nevare !"&#xD;
And with an unaffected shudder, Michel filled&#xD;
his glass and drank it off to seal his determina-&#xD;
tion.-&#xD;
"By ze way, Colonel, where is ze beautifu&#xD;
ladies. your daughters ?" continued Michel, as&#xD;
he refilled his glass.&#xD;
"Kate is on shore with me-would have been&#xD;
at my quarters to-night, but she went on a&#xD;
scout this morning. Annie is a home-body,&#xD;
and stays with her mother,''replied the Colonel.&#xD;
Kate is as much of a soldier as any man in&#xD;
my troop ; as good with the pistol as myself,&#xD;
and if she lacks my strength with the sabre, she&#xD;
makes up for it in skill. Ier cuts and points&#xD;
are swift as winged lightning, and about as&#xD;
deadiv !"     -&#xD;
"She should 'ave live in ze time of ze gran'&#xD;
Napoleon !" said Michel, moved with the en-&#xD;
thusiasm  which the Colonel evinced. "Yes,&#xD;
she should 'ave live zen. IHe would 'ave&#xD;

mon Dien-it make me mad every time I&#xD;

And carried away on a subject which always&#xD;
set him well nigh crazy, Michel, with tears roll-&#xD;
ing down his scarred cheeks, swallowed a brim-&#xD;
ming glass of brandy, and then again became&#xD;
calm.&#xD;
"You spoke of Beverly and my sister in the&#xD;

Does he still cxpress a wish to marry her?"&#xD;
"More zan a wish, Messieur Warburton-&#xD;

"Can you do so ?''&#xD;
"Can I do so, Messieur Warburton?    Sare,&#xD;

Before making arrangements for transporting&#xD;

He was greeted with the warmest courtesy by&#xD;
the two officers, and the never-absent jug of&#xD;
ancient apple-jack was set out, flanked by army&#xD;
sandwiches-an article some of my readers&#xD;
may not have had any experience in. They&#xD;
are not dangerous to digestion-I cannot say so&#xD;
in regard to teeth-and are composed of hard&#xD;
crackers and bacon.&#xD;
After the lunch had been appropriately hon-&#xD;
ored, Michel made his presents to the Colonel&#xD;
and Major, consisting mainly of some fine cigars&#xD;
and good old cognac; which were received with&#xD;
a profusion of thanks, for such articles are gen-&#xD;
erally considered more precious than gold in&#xD;
vamp, for gold cannot always procure them.&#xD;
And were the writer to judge, he would unhesi-&#xD;
tatingly say, that the camp would even be better&#xD;
off without the articles named, than with them.&#xD;
"Where iow, Colonel, is ze Mademoiselle&#xD;
charmante, your daughtare, la belle Kate. I 'ave&#xD;
somesing very elegante for her," asked Michel.&#xD;
"Satan is always at hand when he is called&#xD;
for!" cried a cheerful voice at the entrance of&#xD;
the tent, and Kate entered. She had apparent-&#xD;
ly just come from a ride; for her cheeks were&#xD;
flushed, and a slight flouring of dust lay upon&#xD;
the jaunty gray hat and the long black ostrich&#xD;
feather which drooped from it, as well as upon&#xD;
the' gold-embroidered tunic of gray cloth which&#xD;
fitted her elegant form perfectly. " What can&#xD;
I do for you, mon cher Cap.taine Francaise ?"&#xD;
"Ah,'Mademoiselle, I am very glad for to see&#xD;
you. You can rpake one one very happy man,&#xD;
if you shall accept some leetel presents, zat I&#xD;
'ave bring all ze way from Baltimore 1"&#xD;
And Michel hastned to unfold a large bun-&#xD;
dle which he had brought with him. It con-&#xD;
tained materials for an elegant dress, a fine&#xD;
shawl of Canton crape, a lace vail, several pairs&#xD;
gaiters and slippers, and a set of approved--&#xD;
pardon my particularities, and consider that&#xD;
I'm blushing like a moss-rose, or a full blown&#xD;
hollyhock, kind ladies - a set of Yankee patent-&#xD;
ed hoops.&#xD;
Kate looked at the articles coolly, not a word of&#xD;
pleasure passed her lips, not a look of curiosity&#xD;
could be seen on her handsome face.&#xD;
Michel looked up at her in surprise ; for he&#xD;
had chosen his choicest goods for the present,&#xD;
and expected, of course, woman-like, she would&#xD;
go into ecstasies over the elegant display. Not,&#xD;
she ! There was better stuff in her conposi-&#xD;
tien than is found in the generality of her sex.&#xD;
Looking at the articles, she said :&#xD;
"You are very kind, Captain, and I will ac-&#xD;
cept these articles and send them. to my sister;&#xD;
for you can see by a look at my dress"-and&#xD;
she glanced complacently at her neat tunic,&#xD;
full Turkish trowsers, and elegant riding boots,&#xD;
pith keen roweled spurs affixed-"that Ihave&#xD;
eschewed the woman, in apparel at least, while&#xD;
my dear father is iii the field. But I thank you&#xD;
even more than as if I wore them, for my sister&#xD;
&#xD;
75&#xD;
&#xD;
is dearer to me than myself, and these articles&#xD;
will be appreciated by her. And in return you&#xD;
shall have a present from me, Captain !"&#xD;
And Kate went into an inner apartment of&#xD;
the hut, evidently arranged for her own use.&#xD;
Soon returning, she handed to Michel an elegant&#xD;
silver mounted field-glass, or telescope, such as&#xD;
is used by signal-officers and others on the field.&#xD;
"Here," she said," is one of my first captures.&#xD;
It belonged to one of the Yankee General Mo-&#xD;
Dowell's Aids ; and as I intend to keep so close&#xD;
to the enemy that I shall never need a glass to&#xD;
see them, it will be of little service to me. Take&#xD;
it, Captain, and, when you..use it, think of Kate&#xD;
Stuart, full "f fun and mischief, with a good&#xD;
deal that is Satanic in her composition, butt not&#xD;
utterly heartless, after all."&#xD;
"Mademoiselle-I shall preserve zis glass so&#xD;
long as I shall live !" said Michel, bowing to the&#xD;
very ground. "And since it is for your sistare&#xD;
zat you intend ze articles which I now present&#xD;
to you, please accept zis-one poniard which&#xD;
was make in Venice-from me !"&#xD;
And the polite Frenchman took from under&#xD;
his vest a pearl-handled dagger with a golden&#xD;
scabbard, most exquisitely ornamented with&#xD;
fillagree work.&#xD;
"Ah-that will be of some use-that is a&#xD;
magnificent present, my dear Captain. I ac-&#xD;
cept it with many, many thanks, and will pre-&#xD;
serve it, and use it too, when occasion offers !"&#xD;
cried Kate, enthusiastically, as she took the&#xD;
weapon, and after examining it, with continued&#xD;
expressions of gratification, she placed it in her&#xD;
belt beside her silver-mounted pistols.&#xD;
"Kate is all soldier, you fee !" said the Colo..&#xD;
nel, looking proudly upon his child.&#xD;
Yes, Colonel-if all ze ladie in ze Confed.&#xD;
eracie were like her, and all ze men so brave as&#xD;
she is, ze Yankee doodale Government might&#xD;
considare zemselves in, one grand war which&#xD;
should last forever, if zey not make peace zem-&#xD;
selves !" said Michel, much gratified at the man-&#xD;
ner in which his last present was received.&#xD;
"I wish all were alike interested !" said Stu--&#xD;
art, with a sigh. "There are too many who&#xD;
are cold-blooded, and willing to do anything but&#xD;
fight ! If there is so little enthusiasm in the&#xD;
start, God only knows what the feeling will be&#xD;
by and by, especially if we meet-as we may ex-&#xD;
pect, till we get our hands in-some heavy re-&#xD;
verses !'&#xD;
"Yes; and zem very men zat you so speak of,&#xD;
will be ze ones zat by and by will ask for peace--&#xD;
peace, and-it may be zey will get it! But&#xD;
excuse me-I must go to my schoonare to get&#xD;

-           CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
Not more than a month had gone by since&#xD;
Captain O'Dougal had related to his friend Mr.&#xD;
Winter the unfortunate result of his chase after&#xD;

I'&#xD;
&#xD;
the blockade-running schooner down the bay,&#xD;
when the Captain once more entered the sanc-&#xD;
tum or private office of the merchant.&#xD;
The Captain's jovial face, ruddy as the faces&#xD;
of most seafaring men are, did not exhibit any&#xD;
signs of sadness on this occasion ; and his&#xD;
hearty shake of the hand assured Mr. Winter&#xD;
that his "muscle" was in no way out of order.&#xD;
"I see by the papers that you have been&#xD;
quite lucky in overhauling blockade-runners&#xD;
and taking prizes, Captain," said Mr. Winter,&#xD;
as he motioned the worthy officer to a seat.&#xD;
"I suppose the demijohn is full now, and Mrs.&#xD;
O'D. and the youngster out in a full rig of new&#xD;
toggery."&#xD;
"'hank you, Sir-yes; thank you kindly-&#xD;
yes. The old cutter and yours to command,&#xD;
and in command, have been as lucky as fiddlers&#xD;
lately. And mny old friend the detective, who&#xD;
was on the watch for the fellow who got away&#xD;
from me before, says he is back again, and he is&#xD;
quite sure he is buying up another cargo. If&#xD;
he gets clear of me this time, I will eat a fathom&#xD;
of chain-cable, without mustard ! I wish the&#xD;
Government would let rue have a steam-cutter,&#xD;
instead of our old schooner. I could then&#xD;
dodge into the inlets and little rivers down the&#xD;
bay, and get a peep at the islands-which I&#xD;
cannot now-and do much better than I do."&#xD;
"Yes; steam would be of service to you.&#xD;
Now, our firm has a fine propeller that w&amp;amp;used&#xD;
- formerly in the Charleston trade. She is a good&#xD;
sea-boat, and fast. Perhaps, by proper repre-&#xD;
sentations, the Government night be induced&#xD;
to charter or buy her for. you. We have no&#xD;
present use for hi, and the Government could&#xD;
make its own terms with us."&#xD;
"I wish you could work the matter up, then,&#xD;
Mr. Winter, so that I could get her."&#xD;
'Well, Captain, if you will write to the Sec-&#xD;
retary, stating the necessity which von think&#xD;
there is for such a vessel, I will state in another&#xD;
letter that we have one which the Government&#xD;
can have at cost. I do not like to do more, for&#xD;
I would be one of the last to add one extra dol-&#xD;
lar to the too heavy tax already felt by the&#xD;
Treasury."&#xD;
"I kn~ow that, Sir; and it was to consult you&#xD;
about this matter that I came. I wish to do&#xD;
the best I can for the Government, and every&#xD;
prize I take, as you know, adds to its treasury.&#xD;
It is not alone for my share of prize-money&#xD;
that I am so active, though it takes money to&#xD;
keep Mrs. O'D. and the 'youngster afloat and in&#xD;
good condition, not to speak of yours to com-&#xD;
mand."&#xD;
"And the demijohn, too, which you ever&#xD;
keep'at the service of your friends," said Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Winter, laughing.                           I formerly was live in .iorucauXbut my sent-&#xD;
"Oh, you're too hard on me, Sir-too hard !" ments zat were very popular wien Louis Napo.&#xD;
said the Captain, trying to look serious.   leon was President, and France-poor France a&#xD;
"Well, I will try to soften my hardship by repubhique, were not popular when lie became&#xD;
asking your judgment on some of this old rye, ze Empereur. Ze consequence was, zat to save&#xD;
&#xD;
SADTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
said to have been bottled at the time of the&#xD;
great Whisky Insurrection in Pennsylvania."&#xD;
And the merchant took a black bottle from a&#xD;
closet, and a couple of tumblers.&#xD;
"It would be an insult to it to mix water&#xD;
with such prime mellow liquor as this," sai4&#xD;
the Captain, as he took a sip, and then raised&#xD;
his glass to look through the clear amber of the&#xD;
liquor.&#xD;
"Splendid-splendid !" he said, admiringly.&#xD;
"It looks like water with sunset ailoat on it.&#xD;
And it is as smooth as a lawyer talking to a&#xD;
jury."&#xD;
And after looking at it as lovingly as a&#xD;
mother at her first-born, he sighed, not sadly,&#xD;
and swallowed it slowly. Then he sighed&#xD;
again, and said in a quiet way :&#xD;
"That kind of medicine would make the for-&#xD;
tune of any doctor."'&#xD;
"For fear that you should be taken ill, I will&#xD;
send a dozen bottles of it on board to you,"&#xD;
said Mr. Winter.&#xD;
"1 scarcely know how to thank you," said&#xD;
the Captain. 'If it is to be taken as a preven-&#xD;
tive, I shall never get sick while it lasts "&#xD;
"Use it as cure or preventive," said Win-&#xD;
ter, smiling. "When will you take another&#xD;
cruise?"&#xD;
"Not at present if, as my detective friend&#xD;
says, the fellow who got away from me before is&#xD;
fitting out for another tip. I owe him  a&#xD;
grudge, and am bound to have him, if possible.&#xD;
If I could only get yoursteamer and a good&#xD;
rifled Parrot thirty, or even an eighty-four&#xD;
pounder, I'd have a dash at some of their Rebel&#xD;
gunboats if they came within my range. But&#xD;
I'll go on board and have my clerk make out a&#xD;
letter to the Secretary. Good morning, Sir ;&#xD;
good morning."&#xD;
And the jovial Captain went away with a&#xD;
light heart and a smiling face.&#xD;
Scarcely had he gone, when one of the clerks&#xD;
announced a stranger, whose card bore the name&#xD;
"Alphonse Martel, de Bordeaux."&#xD;
"Show the gentleman in," said the merchant.&#xD;
"I am disengaged."&#xD;
A moment Iater, a short, thick-set gentleman,&#xD;
whose face looked much older than his jet-black&#xD;
hair and heavy beard, attired in the most gen-&#xD;
teel fashion, entered, and, bowing very low,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"'Ave Ize honare to address Messi.-ur Win-&#xD;
tare, ze great mershant of whom I hear in&#xD;
France often upon ze time ?"&#xD;
'Yes Sir, that is my name ; and this, I pre-&#xD;
sume, is yours,' said  fWinter, glancing at&#xD;
the card in his hand.&#xD;
"Alphonse Martel-oui, zat, Sare, is my name.&#xD;
&#xD;
'7&#xD;
&#xD;
my head uppn my body I have emigrate, and&#xD;
'ave come to zis grand republique, to live&#xD;
where I can see Liberty."&#xD;
"Well, Sir, you will find a warm welcome&#xD;
here. Our land is really a home for the op-&#xD;
pressed and down-trodden of all nations. Do&#xD;
yoi intend to go into business here ?"&#xD;
"I 'ave such intention, Sare, and I come to&#xD;
see you, Messieur Wintare, upon biznas. I&#xD;
'ave been inform zat one very good biznas now&#xD;
in ze war will be for to transport for ze Govern-&#xD;
ment of the United States. And as I still pos-&#xD;
sese some money and 'ave one grande pas-&#xD;
sion for ze sea, I 'ave considare zat I should&#xD;
like very much to go in zat biznas, if I can&#xD;
purchase one good transport. One shentilman&#xD;
sat I was wake ze acquaint wiz, tell me zat you&#xD;
have one very fine steamboat zat perhaps you&#xD;
should like for to sell."&#xD;
"We have a propeller," said Mr. Winter;&#xD;
" but an officer in the United States Revenue&#xD;
service, who left me just before you came in,&#xD;
has spoken about her, and is about to try to get&#xD;
her for the United States service. I cannot&#xD;
sell her until the result of his application is&#xD;
learned."&#xD;
"Ah, I am  very much sorry zat I 'ave not&#xD;
come before him; if he do not take her, zen&#xD;
can my applicacione be considare as next,&#xD;
Messieur Wintare ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, Sir-certainly. If the Govern-&#xD;
ment does not need her, we should be glad to&#xD;
sell her, for at present we have no use for&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"She is in good ordare, Sare, is she not?"&#xD;
"Yes, so I understand. Her insurance is at&#xD;
'A 1.' And she made excellent trips when&#xD;
we took her off the line; is represented as be-&#xD;
ing very fast, an excellent sea-boat, well-found&#xD;
and staunch in every respect."&#xD;
"When shall I come, Sare, to know if ze&#xD;
Government shall not want her?"&#xD;
"In the course of a week, if you please ; we&#xD;
shall undoubtedly know by that tine. But I&#xD;
think that it is very likely that the Govern-&#xD;
ment will want her on such liberal terms as we&#xD;
are willing to offer."&#xD;
And the Frenchman, whom our readers may&#xD;
have recognized, bowed himself from the room.&#xD;
"I don't like the looks of that man-he has&#xD;
the devil in his eye !" said the merchant to&#xD;
himself, as the door closed.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
The rear, perhaps, has not forgotten the&#xD;
assemblage of roughs, blacklegs, and regular&#xD;
desperadoes, which composed the very select&#xD;
company chosen by Michel to assist him in his&#xD;
smuggling  or blockade-running   operations,&#xD;
though they are not of a class with whom we&#xD;
rike our memories to dwell. Necessity, that&#xD;
disagreeable tyrant who at times appears in all&#xD;
circles, forces us to again, meet them, in order&#xD;
&#xD;
to keep the links of our story from separa-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Immediately after his interview with Mr.&#xD;
Winter, Carl Michel, elegantly dressed as be&#xD;
was, slipped into a close-curtained hackney-&#xD;
coach, which was waiting near, and was driven&#xD;
to the low and unpopular, though very popu-&#xD;
lous, neighborhood which we once before allud-&#xD;
ed to-the Point.&#xD;
Tossing the driver a liberal fee, after he had&#xD;
stopped near the house which 'we once before&#xD;
described, the Frenchman hurried into it, and&#xD;
passing through the front room, entered that&#xD;
where he last had an interview with his " select&#xD;
company". The same men were there- the&#xD;
same thick-bottomed tumblers-the ame black&#xD;
bottles on the long table and behind the bar,&#xD;
and' the same frowzy-headed woman stood in&#xD;
the corner.&#xD;
"Hurrah for the Captain, here lie comes!&#xD;
Hallo! he's all in his Sunday-go-ttt me ting&#xD;
rig !" cried one of the liveliest of the crew,&#xD;
when Michel entered.&#xD;
"Yes, you should be very much proud, shen-&#xD;
tlemens, zat you 'ave one captain who can look&#xD;
so superbe, so elegant, zat he can appear in ze&#xD;
best society of ze bon ton, and be regard ze same&#xD;
as one prince in ze disguise. No one zat 'ave&#xD;
see me wiz my sea-rig upon me would now&#xD;
recognize Messieur Alphonse Martel of Bor-&#xD;
deaux. I was treat very polite wlierevare I&#xD;
go!"&#xD;
"'What about the steamer, Captain? Can&#xD;
we get one?" asked the man woo had acted as&#xD;
chief mate on the previous voyage.&#xD;
"I am afraid not ze one zat we desire. Zat&#xD;
dam revenue-euttare man is after her, and if&#xD;
he persuade. ze Government to buy her, we will&#xD;
be disappoint. Sacre, she would be just what&#xD;
we desire ! I wish zat revenue-cuttare  fcare&#xD;
was down in ze bottom of ze Shesapeake !-&#xD;
There are ether steamers to be had !" saki&#xD;
the first speaker.&#xD;
"None zat are so good-none so fast, sat&#xD;
draw so little of ze watare, zat carry so much!"&#xD;
said Michel, taking a seat and helping himself&#xD;
to a glass of whisky.&#xD;
"'Well, we must have something. It will never&#xD;
do for us to stay long around here. The infer-&#xD;
nal detectives are everywhere, and the most of&#xD;
us are * well spotted that we have to keep in&#xD;
doors now !"&#xD;
"Do not bozzare about tl:at ! We shall very&#xD;
soon be off in some way, for I've ze c:argo all&#xD;
ready purchass ! ' said Michel. "And howabout&#xD;
ze ladie ?  'Ave you discovare what I desire,&#xD;
Messieur Hoyle ?"&#xD;
Yes-I've made some discoveries in regard&#xD;
to her habits. She has made few acquaintances&#xD;
in bet- neighborhood where shs goes to visit.&#xD;
But I have learned that she is very charitable,&#xD;
and goes much amongst the poor and sick near&#xD;
where she lives !"&#xD;

"Bon-in zis way, when we are ready for to&#xD;

to say zare mozzare is very poor and is near for&#xD;

zen one carriage all ready on ze street, and quick,&#xD;

"She'll scream like a steambQat, I'm afraid,&#xD;
when we lay hands on her !" said one of the men.&#xD;
"If you use one handkerchief over her&#xD;
mouth, 1 sink she not scream much loud," said&#xD;
Michel. "And zen if you 'ave put upon it plenty&#xD;
of ze chloroform, she will go into one sleep very&#xD;
soon, directly !"&#xD;
"Yes-that's the talk.  The Captain has the&#xD;
idea !" cried one of the oldest hands in the gang.&#xD;
"But suppose she should happen to carry&#xD;
barkers. i've known, women to do such things,&#xD;
and shoot, too, when it was least expected !"&#xD;
" Pshaw !  She is not one of that kind, I&#xD;
don't think !" said the man who had been most&#xD;
forward in making 'discoveries in regard to&#xD;
Sadia. "She looks as pleasant and gentle as a&#xD;
Quaker girl in meeting, and I've neither seen or&#xD;
heard of any such thing. And the niggers, who&#xD;
are always" boasting of what their mistress is&#xD;
and what she does, would be rather apt to hint&#xD;
such a thing, to show her courage. I'll risk&#xD;
ge-tting shot by her, when the time comes. I&#xD;
don't believe that I am to die by a woman's hands&#xD;
at any rate !"&#xD;
"Not till they make women hangmen, Hoyle !"&#xD;
cried one of the party, with a laugh.&#xD;
"Well, we will, soon make ze arrangements,&#xD;
shentilmen !" said Michel. "One sing is cer-&#xD;
tain, when we go, ze ladee must go wiz us; not&#xD;
only because we shall shall get much money&#xD;
for her, but more zan zat, I 'ave given my word&#xD;
and my honare, zat she shall be wiz us; and&#xD;
when I say zat, it shall be. Ze word of Carl&#xD;
Michel, when wiz it he extend his honare, is&#xD;
more sacred zan his life !"&#xD;
"I reckon we can get her off without much&#xD;
trouble !" said IIoyle. "And I want to be&#xD;
about it as soon as 1 can, for Baltimore isn't&#xD;
what it used to be to me and men of our kid-&#xD;
ney. Detectives and coppers are too thick here&#xD;
for comfort. You can't have a decent row&#xD;
without being took up. You can't dropg in to&#xD;
take a drink, or look for a pigeon, or a greeny&#xD;
in some pushing crib, without finding some over-&#xD;
hauling curse close aboard of you! A man has&#xD;
to be extra sharp to keep out of limbo now, in1&#xD;
this place 1"&#xD;
And then Hoyle heaved a deep sigh, and&#xD;
drank off a full tumbler of whisky to swim his&#xD;
grief in.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIII.       -&#xD;
Just as it was in regard to cavalry at the&#xD;
commencement of the war, so for a time was it&#xD;
&#xD;
with the introduction of steam intg the naval&#xD;
and revenue service.'&#xD;
And thus it was that Captain O'Dougal's en.&#xD;
deavor to get the propeller in place of tie old&#xD;
cutter was fruitless, and his proposition to the&#xD;
Department rejected without question. And in&#xD;
iris grief at his disappointment he went at onee&#xD;
to his friend, Mr. Winter.&#xD;
"Bad luck to their stupidity," said he, as he&#xD;
took a seat in Mr. Winter's office--" they tell&#xD;
me that I can do well enough with my cutter&#xD;
unde r canvas, and the Department can't afford&#xD;
steam ! 'Tis enough to make me go to steam-&#xD;
ing it on that old whisky you so kindly sent me,&#xD;
Sir!"&#xD;
"Yes, I was aware that an adverse decision&#xD;
was made !"- said the merchant. " We received&#xD;
a letter this morning, declining our offer in re-&#xD;
gard to the vessel; and upon your account more&#xD;
than our own I regret the disappoinitment. We&#xD;
already have an offer for our vessel at private&#xD;
sale, and of course we shall ask and get much&#xD;
more for her from private persons than we&#xD;
would ask from the GoverLmcnt at this crisis."&#xD;
"Just my luck! If it wasn't for Mrs. O'L&#xD;
and the youngster, I'd resign out of spite,&#xD;
Here I've been laying out plants for bagging a&#xD;
lot of fellows that I know are skulking about&#xD;
them rivers, and I can never run my cutter un-&#xD;
der sail up into the narrow channels; and if I&#xD;
tried it, I'd get caught without a breeze, ands&#xD;
like as not get all cut up without the power to&#xD;
help myself! It is too bad-too bad !"&#xD;
'Vell, do not take it too much to heart, Cap-&#xD;
tain. I've a little of that old whisky left- try a&#xD;
glass, and see how it mellows disappointment."&#xD;
"Thank you, Sir. I see that you know the&#xD;
weak side of me, coming from the Celtic side of&#xD;
my ancestry ; for whisky is the great antidote of&#xD;
grief, I believe, in my mother-land. But joking&#xD;
aside, this puts me out more than I can tell&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
Mr. Winter filled a couple. of glasses of old&#xD;
rye for himself and the Captain, and had just,&#xD;
placed his own to his lips, when a clerk entered&#xD;
and said that Mr. Alphonse Armand requested&#xD;
an interview with Mr. Winter.&#xD;
"Ah-the very gentleman who wants to pur-&#xD;
chase the steamer ! Admit him !" said Mr.&#xD;
Winter, placing another glass on his table.&#xD;
Dressed full as elegantly as when he first vis-&#xD;
ited the merchant, Mr. Alphonse Martel, alias&#xD;
Michel, entered the room.&#xD;
Not being aware that any person besides Mr.&#xD;
Winter was there, tlie Frenchman, in spite of&#xD;
his usual self-assurance, was somewhat taken&#xD;
aback to fiind a United States officer there, and&#xD;
hesitated at the door.&#xD;
"Oh, come in, Sir-no privacy here. Come&#xD;
in, Mr. Martel," said Mr. Winter, in a friendly&#xD;
tone. "Let me introduce you to my particu-&#xD;

"Very proud, Sare, to make ze acquaintance&#xD;
of your friend, Captain de Dugal! Very 'appy&#xD;
Sare !" said the Frenchman, taking off his hat&#xD;
and bowing very low,&#xD;
"Take a seat, Sir, and join us in a glass of&#xD;
old rye. We were about to indulge when your&#xD;
name was announced !" said the merchant, as&#xD;
he filled a glass and handed it to the French-&#xD;
man.&#xD;
" Ab, Sare, I am very much honare ! I drink&#xD;
to your healt's, shentilmen 1"&#xD;
"I suppose you came to renew your inquiries&#xD;
about our steamer ?" said Mr. Winter, as he re-&#xD;
placed his glass on the table.&#xD;
"Yes, Sare-zat was my bizness !" said the&#xD;
other, looking with a disquieted air at the rev-&#xD;
enue-officer. "But I am in not one .grand hur-&#xD;

"Oh, I am disengaged now! The Captain&#xD;
here has just come to inform me that he has&#xD;

sixty-five thousandidollars." 1&#xD;
"Sixty-five tousands of dollars!  Zat is&#xD;
much money. But I will see my friends. I&#xD;
sink zat we will pure bass! I will see you and&#xD;
let you know, Sare, by one more day."&#xD;
"Very well, Sir, we will await your decision.&#xD;
If you wish to examine the vessel, the watch-&#xD;
man on ,board will afford you every facility."&#xD;
"Ian "much oblige, Sare. I'ave examine her&#xD;
one, two, tree time, before. I wish you good&#xD;
morning, Sare--and ze same to ze Capitain de&#xD;
I)ugal."&#xD;
And Michel bowed himself out with less cer-&#xD;
Ftmony than he had used on his first visit.&#xD;
"I don't like the cut of that fellow's jib !"&#xD;
Raid Captain O'Dougal, bluntly, when the door&#xD;
closed behind the receding visitor. "IIe may&#xD;
he all right, and square, but I like to see men&#xD;
look another plum in the eye when they speak.&#xD;
to him."&#xD;
"Your business makes you rather suspicious&#xD;
of all strangers, I expect !" said Mr. Winter,&#xD;
with a smile. Then looking at his watch, he&#xD;
said, "It is near my usual lunch-hour, suppose&#xD;
you go and try a salad, or a soft-crab with me."&#xD;
"I've no objections !" said the Captain, "es-&#xD;
pecially as I shall be too late for our twelve-&#xD;
&amp;amp;clock dinner before I get aboard, and I've&#xD;
said good-bye to Mrs. O'Do gal and the young-&#xD;
ster for to-day."&#xD;
T -       CEIAPTER    XLIV.&#xD;
The gang under the rule of Michel were all as-&#xD;
'sembled imtheir rendezvous on the Point, in-&#xD;
dulging as usual in liquor and cards, for men of&#xD;
their class know no higher enjoyment than that&#xD;
which they find in such amusement.&#xD;
&#xD;
79&#xD;
&#xD;
"I wish we were afloat again !" said the one&#xD;
named Hoyle, who, in honor of his name, was&#xD;
quite an adept in all the mysteries of old sledge,&#xD;
euchre, forty-fives, etc., etc.&#xD;
'"Why,    don't see but what we're well&#xD;
enough of here !" said another. "We've noth-&#xD;
ing to do, money left over, and as good lush&#xD;
(drink) as aizy man can want. I'm in no hurry&#xD;
to leave snug quarters -that's what's the mat-&#xD;
ter with me !&#xD;
"The lush is all O. K.-and the quarters are&#xD;
well enough !" replied Hoyle. "But since&#xD;
these blasted new police and detectives have&#xD;
got to work, a fellow never knows what danger&#xD;
he is in. When old Kane had charge of th4&#xD;
"cops" a f      could do about as he liked.&#xD;
If he got nabbed drafew shiners would clear&#xD;
him, and that was the end of it. The next time&#xD;
we get sdowi into Dixie I believe I'll stay&#xD;
there !"&#xD;
"A fool you for that. Old Jeff will have&#xD;
you in his bullet-eating army before you can&#xD;
play three hands of euchre, and then some&#xD;
Yank will send you to kingdom come before&#xD;
you're even prayed for! Dixie will do to trade&#xD;
in, but blast the fighting for me !"&#xD;
The conversation was here interrupted by&#xD;
the entrance of Michel, whose eyes flashed like&#xD;
those of a snake as he cried:&#xD;
"Good news, shentilmen ! Bon informa-&#xD;
cione ! Superb news have I for you. I 'ave&#xD;
purchass ze steamboat-I 'ave -acquire ze&#xD;
Vapeur ! Ze propel zat is name ze Lone Star,&#xD;

"Hurrah for him !" shouted one of the&#xD;
gang.&#xD;
"Hurrah ! Hurrah ! Hurrah !" cried the&#xD;
rest, amid the clashing of glasses and stamping&#xD;
of feet.&#xD;
"And now what's next on the peppergram,&#xD;
Captain ?" asked  Hoye. " Can we go on&#xD;
board and get the craft ready for sea ?"&#xD;
"Yes-you can go on ze board-but she is&#xD;
all ready for ze sea. She 'ave coal in ze lockares&#xD;
and watare in ze boilare. All zat now she need&#xD;
is our cargo, and ze pfovisione, and ze fire ins.&#xD;

run against ze wind rnd she must tack and tack&#xD;

"When can we get off?" asked Hoyle.&#xD;
"Zis night, .if you all work like ze diable.&#xD;
Ze more soon, ze more bettare ! For zen no-&#xD;

&#xD;
"Yes-the idea is&#xD;

"Well, we can do&#xD;

Messieur Hoyle, you 'ave one difficulty before&#xD;

" You mean the young'woman, I suppose !"&#xD;

which I give you now, fifty dollare for hire a&#xD;

"There shall not be !-' said IIoyle, as he&#xD;
pocketed the money. "You can count upon&#xD;
her being aboard Captain. I'll try the charita-&#xD;
ble-visit dodge first, and then use chloroform&#xD;
if I can!"&#xD;
"Eh bien-and now shentilmens; so soon as&#xD;

"Good-three cheers for the Captain, and a&#xD;
drink all round before we go aboard!1" cried&#xD;
IIoyle.&#xD;
The cheers were given, of course; and the&#xD;
drinks followed as usual.&#xD;
Then the preparations for removal were made,&#xD;
and soon the old den on the Point was once&#xD;
more vacated by its riotous crew.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLV.&#xD;
We have not before-glanced at Sadia in her&#xD;
boarding-house, where, with the good Mrs. Mer-&#xD;
edith, she found in every respect a home.&#xD;
It was evening of the night of the same day&#xD;
when Michel gleefully informed his lawless coni-&#xD;
panions of the acquisition of the steamer so&#xD;
useful for their nefarious business.&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith, one of'those still elderly ladies,&#xD;
whose faces seem to map out care and a quiet&#xD;
resignation to the same,'sat by a small table&#xD;
engaged in sewing, and listening to the children,&#xD;
who were reciting to their sister Sadia the les-&#xD;
sons which they had studied through the day.&#xD;
The bearing of Mrs. M., her extremely neat&#xD;
and genteel dress, composed as it was of very,&#xD;
cheap materials, all indicated the lady of taste,&#xD;
who had seen days when she could afford more&#xD;
elegance than at this time.&#xD;
The little parlor in which the four were seat-&#xD;
ed, lacked the elegant furniture which wealth&#xD;
would have commanded; but everything was&#xD;
there which was actually needed, and all arrang-&#xD;
ed so neatly and with so much taste that few&#xD;
rooms could have been made more pleasantly&#xD;
comfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sadie, who, eaei morning before she went to&#xD;
the countm-r~iom, gave out the lessons which&#xD;
her brother and sister were to study during tha&#xD;
'day, occupied each evening when at home-and&#xD;
she was seldom out-in hearing those lessons,&#xD;
and correcting any errors into which the dear&#xD;
ones had fallen.&#xD;
Then until -bedtime she read or played hep?&#xD;
guitar and sang )lasait songs, making home&#xD;
happy with her music. For gentle music and&#xD;
home-love go hand in hand, an. the shadows of&#xD;
care fall lightly where they are.&#xD;
The children bad studied dilligently, and a&#xD;
happy smile passed over the lovely face of&#xD;
Sadia when she closed the books, and calling&#xD;
them to her side, kissed her brother and sister&#xD;
fondly, while she praised them-for their gooduses&#xD;
"I have so much to make me happy,' she&#xD;
said to Mrs. Meredith, who seemed herself to&#xD;
enjoy the pleasure felt by her young boarder.&#xD;
"The parents who were so dear to me have&#xD;
been lifted up to heaven, and are spared the tem&#xD;
rible sorrow of seeing their beloved country&#xD;
disunited, its soil-drenched with blood, their&#xD;
own son a traitor, and their cherished hom a&#xD;
desolation. Providence has [eeni most kind to&#xD;
me, raised up new friends, and enabled rue by&#xD;
my own endeavors to support mx self and these&#xD;
loved ones in comfort. Oh, how much haveI to&#xD;
be thankful fur!,&#xD;
Few would take their changed lot from afufi-&#xD;
ence to a necessity for labor as well as you do,&#xD;
my dear Miss Sadia !" said Mrs. Meredith, with&#xD;
a smile as gentle as her voice. " It is indeed a&#xD;
blessing to have a spirit which, proud in all&#xD;
proper things, can aceornodate itself to the lot&#xD;
which necessity brings upon it. And I am far&#xD;
more happy'than I was when you first came to&#xD;
my house-~for I then feared you would despond&#xD;
under care, as I too often have done. Your&#xD;
cheerfulness has encouraged and aided me, for&#xD;
I was lonely ; and with my poor husband's suf-&#xD;
ferings to look upon. aidso little to aid him&#xD;
with, I often felt as if I would yield to despair&#xD;
-and sink under my burden. You caine like a&#xD;
blessing to me, my dear girl, and it will be a sad&#xD;
day when I have to par nxith you. You and&#xD;
the children see:n to me as near as if you we e&#xD;
indeed my own !"&#xD;
''I know that you feel so, Mrs. Meredith;&#xD;
your kind acts verify your words: and I hope&#xD;
that it will be long before we p art, for I feel ia-&#xD;
deed at home with you."&#xD;
A ring at the door-bell at this moment caus-&#xD;
ed Mrs. Meredith to rise; for she had permitted&#xD;
her servant to go out on a visit that evening,&#xD;
and she had to attend the door in person.&#xD;
She returned in a moment followed by a rag.&#xD;
ged and very "hard-looking" boy, whose fae&#xD;
seemed to be known to Sadia, for she smiled as&#xD;
she said to Mrs. Meredith:&#xD;
"I expect this call is for me. IHow is your&#xD;
mother, my poor boy ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Wuss, a heap wuss. Mum, and he wants to&#xD;
s0e you right off for sumfin !" saidI the boy, in&#xD;
that sniveling tope which seems habitual to&#xD;
begary-. .&#xD;
t   \eVga ,  I will put on my shawl and go down&#xD;
there directly.  l urry home and telI your&#xD;
mother that I'11 come in a few moments."&#xD;
"Yes'in, yesm."  And the ragged boy hur-&#xD;
ried away.&#xD;
"You had better let Napoleon go with you,&#xD;
my dear Miss Sadia, said Mrs. Meredith. '- I&#xD;
do not like to see you go out in the night&#xD;
alone   ..&#xD;
Oh, it is only a little ways-not more than&#xD;
three or four squares distant, if so far," said&#xD;
Sadia, hurriedly pijarng for her walk. " Do&#xD;
not be alarmed, for I will soon be back."&#xD;
And the noble hearted girl hurrid 4If upon&#xD;
her mission of mercy.&#xD;
Nevertheless, Mrs. Meredith went into the&#xD;
kitchen and ,told Napoleon to hurry after his&#xD;
mistress, and not to lose sight of her&#xD;
CIIAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
Mr. Winter was at home with his family, lis-&#xD;
tening to a song froni his favorite daughter, the&#xD;
pretty and chubby Carrie. The business of the&#xD;
ay was over and its cares forgotten. For he&#xD;
was not one of those men who carry the toils&#xD;
of business home whit them and never give&#xD;
their mind a moment's rest or the benefit of&#xD;
change.&#xD;
It was getting pretty well on toward bedtime&#xD;
when a servant hurrie fy entered and said:&#xD;
"The servant of Miss de Mont fort is below,&#xD;
Sir, and wants to see you very much. -IIe says&#xD;
something terrible has happened to his mis-&#xD;
tress."&#xD;
"To Miss De Montfort? Send the man to&#xD;
me directly I" cried Mr. Winter, springing to&#xD;
his feet.&#xD;
In a moment, Napokon, trembling with ex-&#xD;
citement, and so agitated that he could scarcely&#xD;
speak, came into the room.&#xD;
"0 de Lor' .O de Lor'! Miss Sady done&#xD;
gone-Miss Sady done gone !' was all that the&#xD;
poor negro could say at first.&#xD;
"What is the matter with your mistress, my&#xD;
man?   Speak out, and let me know," cried Mr.&#xD;
Winter.&#xD;
"She's done gone-done gone! Dey's run&#xD;
'her off!" cried Napoleon, in almost a howl, as&#xD;
he wrung his black hands in agony.&#xD;
"Who?    Where is she?  Speak, and tell me&#xD;
what is the matter, you rascal! "&#xD;
"I doesn't know where she is now. De&#xD;
blessed angel am ene gone .'',&#xD;
"Gone where f Explain yourself before I&#xD;
get out of patience with you !" cried Mr. Win-&#xD;
te," angrily.&#xD;
"Don't be mad wid me, Mars'r Winter ; I is&#xD;
most done gone dead now. Jess you lissen, an'&#xD;
I tell you all I know 'bout how it was."&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, ao on, and be in a hurry, so that I&#xD;
may know "lint to do."&#xD;
Wtell, you ste, Mars'r, I was a sit tin' in do&#xD;
kitchen, round dar- at Miss Meridet's, when Miss&#xD;
enIcdet come in and says to me: ' Napoleon,&#xD;
ycar young mfliSSu:s has jest gone out down de&#xD;
si reet on a v isi to a sick 'oiman us has sent for&#xD;
her. Kun quick, my man, and keep close to&#xD;
her, so no harm doesn't. happen to her.' And I&#xD;
put on my hat a d went, Murs'r, jest a fans~ as&#xD;
I could. I seen her when I gut on de street,&#xD;
way on ahead of me, and I went jest as fast as&#xD;
I could, and i'd got must up to her, when two&#xD;
men grIbbed her, and shoved her in a carriage&#xD;
dat was a standin' wid de door -open right by&#xD;
de sidewalk. She jest give one screech, and den&#xD;
dcv seemed to Choke her, for I didn't hear nuf-&#xD;
fin' more. 1 run Jest as fast as I could to help&#xD;
I her, but de men jump in zvid her, and de driver&#xD;
whipped his horses iito a run, and dey went off&#xD;
like hghtnin'. I run and run, and I couldn't&#xD;
catch 'em, and den dey clean went out of sight,&#xD;
anl I conic back to Miss Meridet, and she done.&#xD;
told me to come here to you and tell you. An'&#xD;
I left her and de poor chillens a ergin', and&#xD;
come jess as fast as I could."&#xD;
"Which way id the carriage go 2" asked Mr.&#xD;
Winter, hurriedly.&#xD;
Down toward de Basin, Mars'r."&#xD;
" What colhr were the horses'."&#xD;
"Dark collud, I believe, Mars'r. I was so&#xD;
skeered I didn't notice much."&#xD;
"Poor child ! This is terrible! I will go to&#xD;
alarm the police, and try to get upon the track&#xD;
of the villains !" cried Mr. Winter.&#xD;
" And you, girls," continued he to his daugh-&#xD;
ters, "go down to Mrs. Meredith's with this&#xD;
man INapoleon, and bring the two children up&#xD;
here. This shall be their borne until I find&#xD;
their sister."&#xD;
"es, father," cried Carrie and her sister.&#xD;
And they hurried away to put on garr.nts for&#xD;
the street ; while Mr. XVnter sent his servant&#xD;
for his hat and cane.&#xD;
Have ; on any idea who can have been con,&#xD;
corned in this outrage ?" Mrs. Winter asked of&#xD;
her husband.&#xD;
"Undoubtedly some emissaries of her brother&#xD;
or the dastardly cousin she has told us about,"&#xD;
said Mr. Winter. "But I will alarm the police&#xD;
and the Provost-Marshal, and she may yet be&#xD;
rescued. It is the boldest thing that I ever&#xD;
heard of, and I hardly think her captors can&#xD;
escape-or, at the best, I doubt if they can get&#xD;
outside the Federal lines without detect ion."&#xD;
Being ready for his walk, the kind-hearted&#xD;
merchant hurried away, telling Lis wire io take&#xD;
the kindest care of the children when they cane.&#xD;
CIIAPTER XLVII.&#xD;

seizure, so powerful were those in whose grasp&#xD;
she found herself, that, with strength to screauk&#xD;

only once for assistance, she was thrust helpless f&#xD;
into the carriage, which was instantly in rapid&#xD;
motion. And then some moist cloth seemed to&#xD;
be enveloped around her head, a wild stupefy-&#xD;
ing sensation came over her, and for a time she&#xD;
knew no more.&#xD;
When she again knew herself, she found that&#xD;
she was in a small room, not more than eight&#xD;
or ten feet square, with only one chair, a small&#xD;
table, a looking-glass, a wash-stand, and the&#xD;
narrow berth or bed upon which she lay, for&#xD;
frnittre.  These things she observed by the&#xD;
light of a small swinging lamp. that hung from&#xD;
the ceiling above, for the room was tightly closed.&#xD;
She knew, by hearing the dash of water, the&#xD;
sound of machinery, and feeling a rocking and&#xD;
trembling sensation, that she must be on a&#xD;
steamboat. But that was all that she knew of&#xD;
her situation. So suddenly and so unexpected-&#xD;
ly had the events occurred on shore, that she&#xD;
had not even seen the face of one of her captors.&#xD;
She had heard but two words, and they were,&#xD;
"Drive on !"-uttered at the moment she was&#xD;
lifted into the carriage.&#xD;
Her first action, upon the recovery of con-&#xD;
sciousness, was to spring from the bed and to&#xD;
glance in the mirror which fronted her. She&#xD;
saw a pale and anxious face only-no marks of&#xD;
violence.&#xD;
Then she quickly put her hand down into a&#xD;
side-pocket or her dress, and a flush of return-&#xD;
ing color came upon her cheek as she drew out&#xD;
a handsome revolver, of that very handy size&#xD;
next to the "Navy pattern". She smiled as she&#xD;
saw that it was yet loaded, and murmured:&#xD;
"Thank Heaven ! this has not been discov-&#xD;
ered yet! Life and honor are still in my&#xD;
bands -"&#xD;
And .after looking at each cap, to see that it&#xD;
was right, she replaced the weapon in her pock-&#xD;
et, and then looked carefully around the room,&#xD;
to examine its capacities as a prison. She now&#xD;
saw, for the first time, a Finall red curtain on&#xD;
the ceiling, directly over her bed. Upon rais-&#xD;
ing this, a window, about eighteeniinches square,&#xD;
permitted her to look out upon an angry sea-&#xD;
the waves dashing and pitching to a greater&#xD;
height than she had ever seen them. At a&#xD;
great distance over the foaming waters, she saw&#xD;
what she supposed to be land, and also, here&#xD;
and there, white specks, like vessels under can-&#xD;
vas.&#xD;
A noise as of some one approaching the door&#xD;
caused her to suddenly drop he curtain to its&#xD;
place; and to assume a sitting position on the&#xD;
ide of the bed.&#xD;
The door was opened immediately afterward,&#xD;
and a woman's face--a coarse, repulsive face,&#xD;
surmounted by a frowsy head of hair-looked&#xD;
In.&#xD;
"So! waked up, hey ye 2" said this female,&#xD;
advancing half of a dirtily-clad figure into the&#xD;
room. eFeel hungry, eh "&#xD;
&#xD;
"Where am I ?" asked Sadia, instead of re-&#xD;
plying to the question.&#xD;
Aboard of a steamer on the Chesapeake.&#xD;
Don't you feel her roll and tumble? A nice&#xD;
breeze and pretty much of a sea on !" replied&#xD;
the woman.&#xD;
"Where is the vessel going ?" asked Sadia,&#xD;
scarcely able to suppress her disgust; for the&#xD;
reeking fumes of liquor came floating in on the&#xD;
repulsive woman's breath.&#xD;
To Dixie, to be sure; there's where she's&#xD;
bound ! Now will you have some breakfast-&#xD;
fried ham and 'taters, coffee and sassengers, with&#xD;
hard-tack dry or soaked ?"&#xD;
"Who brought me here ?" asked Sadia, still.&#xD;
unheeding the questions of the other.&#xD;
"You must ask the Cap'n. He knows all&#xD;
about it, and that's more than I do."&#xD;
"Who is the Captain "&#xD;
"Captain Michel, a Frenchman, and just&#xD;
about as smart as menare made now-a-days."&#xD;
"Michel! - Michel !" said Sadia, quickly.&#xD;
"Then I know why I have been torn away&#xD;
from my home and friends.He eis in the em-&#xD;
ploy of my brother, or one even yet worse than&#xD;
he. Woman, tell that Michel that I want to see&#xD;
him !"&#xD;
"Yes, 'm, directly. But what about the&#xD;
breakfast ?"&#xD;
"I do not' wish any."&#xD;
"Very well-so much saved. But I reckon,&#xD;
you'll come to your appetite by-and-by."&#xD;
And the frowsy head was withdrawn, the&#xD;
door closed, and the key turned in the lock."&#xD;
"Yes, this is the work of either Warburton&#xD;
or Beverly, or perhaps both !" said Sadia, as&#xD;
she again turned to the little window, and look-&#xD;
ed out upon the dark waves and their foaming&#xD;
crests.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVIII.&#xD;
Mr. Winterupon leaving his house, instantly&#xD;
went to the office of the Chief of Police, and&#xD;
gave information which at once put the detec-&#xD;
tives of the whole force afoot on the search for&#xD;
our unfortunate heroine.&#xD;
Fromthence heehurried to the office of the&#xD;
Provost-Marshal, fortunately finding that offi-&#xD;
cial in ; and soon mounted patrols were dis-&#xD;
patched in every direction. A select party of&#xD;
men, with an officer, were at his request sent&#xD;
with him ; and he hurried down toward the&#xD;
wharves in the direction where Napoleon had&#xD;
last seen the carriage going.&#xD;
It was quite late before he reached the&#xD;
wharves ; for it had taken a considerable time to&#xD;
visit the places to which he had gone. Just as&#xD;
they reached a wharf which pointed out toward&#xD;
the lower harbor, a steamer already in motion&#xD;
was seen receding rapidly from it.&#xD;
"That is the Lone Star, purchased from our&#xD;
firm only this morning !" exclaimed Mr. Winter&#xD;
in surprise. "I do not understand what can&#xD;
&#xD;
take her out so soon. I understood Captain&#xD;
Martel.to say that he had no engagements for&#xD;
her yet, and that it would be some time before&#xD;
he put her into business?   There must be&#xD;
something wrong in this! I wish we could&#xD;
stop her and know what is meant by this sud-&#xD;
den departure !"&#xD;
"She'll be stopped down at the mouth of the&#xD;
harbor, where 1he revenue-cutter is anchored !"&#xD;
said the officer. "No vessel is allowed to pass&#xD;
her at night without having proper authority !"&#xD;
"Then wg will soon learn whether she has&#xD;
that authority or not !" said the merchant.&#xD;
"She has a full head of steam on, and will soon&#xD;
be close to the cutter. She does not seen to&#xD;
avoid her in any way !"&#xD;
"No ; she is running close by her side.&#xD;
What a gale it is, blowing up the bay--nothing&#xD;
but a steamer could make headway in the teeth&#xD;
of it!"&#xD;
"The-e-they see her on board the cutter-&#xD;
I see lights flashing from her deck !" cried Mr.&#xD;
Winter.&#xD;
"Yes; but the steamer does not stop !" said&#xD;
the officer. "See-she keeps on ; and now she&#xD;
is beyond, and dead ahead of the cutter!"&#xD;
"Yes; and something is wrong for all that !&#xD;
See how those lights flash from place to place&#xD;
upon the cutter's deck! And there goes a gun!&#xD;
I would stake a thousand dollars that the poor&#xD;
girl is on board of that boat," cried the excited&#xD;
merchant.&#xD;
Let us ptocure a boat and get on board the&#xD;
cutter," said the officer; "we may be of some&#xD;
use there, and at any rate can learn the news."&#xD;
"Yes," said the -merchant.  "Look around&#xD;
for a boat, men ; I will give ten dollars to the&#xD;
first one who secures a boat to take us off to&#xD;
the cutter."  s&#xD;
The inducement was scarcelyneeded, for the&#xD;
men were all willing, and in a short time a&#xD;
boat was secured, and the party on their way to&#xD;
the revenue vessel.&#xD;
But the steamer, apparently unharmed, al-&#xD;
though three or four guns had been fired from&#xD;
the cutter, had moved rapidly out of sight down&#xD;
the bay.&#xD;
"What is the matter, Captain O'Dougal? "&#xD;
asked the merchant, when, after a hard row&#xD;
against the wind, his boat was alongside the&#xD;
cutter.&#xD;
"Matter enough, Sir !" growled   Captain&#xD;
O'Dougal. "By the holy harper that played&#xD;
for Moses, I'm mad enough to swallow a boot-&#xD;
jack! -This is the economy of the Govern-&#xD;
ment-there goes a steamer, bound, without&#xD;
a doubt, to Dixie, running right away from&#xD;
me into the wind's eye ; and it would be as&#xD;
much use for me now to get under way to&#xD;
look after her as it would be to hunt after&#xD;
Sir John Frankin in a canal-boat !"&#xD;
"How did she pass you so easily, Sir?" ask-&#xD;
ed the officer.&#xD;
&#xD;
I "Why, she-came down upon as so suddenly&#xD;
and with so little noise that the watch did not&#xD;
see her or call me until~she was close aboard !&#xD;
I ran up from the cabin and hailed her just as&#xD;
she was passing, asked what steamer she was,&#xD;
and ordered her to heave to !&#xD;
"The answer which came from her was, that&#xD;
it was the United States transport Swan, bound&#xD;
down the bay with dispatches, and couldn't&#xD;
stop ! I knew better, for the Swan is a side-&#xD;
wheel boat instead of a propeller.  So I hailed&#xD;
her again, and told her I'd fire if she didn't stop.&#xD;
She then just luffed ahead of me and her skip-&#xD;
per sung out, 'shoot-shoot you darn fool I'&#xD;
And I did shoot like a darned fool ; for I&#xD;
couldn't throw a shot near her, and in three or&#xD;
four minutes s'he was out of sight to wiilward !&#xD;
There is one comfort-there's more than one&#xD;
of our gunboats in the bay below, and the&#xD;
mouth of York River has been closely watched&#xD;
since that rascally schooner got away from me&#xD;
there!"&#xD;
Another boat came alongside at this moment,&#xD;
and the detective officer, who had before in-&#xD;
formed O'Dougal of the actions of the smug-&#xD;
gling parties on shore, sprung on deck.&#xD;
"Has the propeller gone by ?" he asked,&#xD;
hastily.&#xD;
" By ? Yes, a half-hour or an hour ago !"&#xD;
said the Captain. "She's hull down before this&#xD;
time, for she went like a scared cat !"&#xD;
"Unfortunate. I was on the track of her,&#xD;
and put on a wrong scent. She had a valuable&#xD;
cargo on board, and was bound for Dixie 1" said&#xD;
the detective.&#xD;
"Just my luck. Bless the Government that&#xD;
leaves me this old tub to chase fast steamers !"&#xD;
said Captain O'Dougal, bitterly.&#xD;
"Did you know who the'leader of this smug-&#xD;
gling party was ?" asked Mr. Winter, address-&#xD;
ing the Government detective.&#xD;
"Yes, the same Frenchman who ran a&#xD;
schooner out of here six or eight weeks ago-&#xD;
the schooner which got into York River, and&#xD;
escaped' from this cutter."&#xD;
" Was his name Martel-Alphonse Martel?"&#xD;
"No-the name he goes by among his gang,&#xD;
is Michel. But such men use whatever suits&#xD;
them, when they have occasion for it !"&#xD;
"Michel-that name I have heard before!&#xD;
Yes, I have heard Miss De Montfort speak of&#xD;
such a man being the guide for her brother&#xD;
when he was pursuing her. The poor girl must&#xD;
be on board of that steamer. Captain O'Dougal,&#xD;
cannot you give chase to the villain ?"&#xD;
"It would be mere madness to try to beat&#xD;
down the bay in this gale, with the thought of&#xD;
catching a steamer !" said the Captain. "The&#xD;
best thing which can be done will be, to tele-&#xD;
graph to Fortress Monroe, and to the Potomac&#xD;
flotilla, that a vessel of her description is on the&#xD;
way down the bay, and to put the gunboats&#xD;
down that way on the lookout for her. She&#xD;

upon your advice immediately, for the Govern-&#xD;

cried the merchant.&#xD;
And in a few moments he was on his way to&#xD;
the shore.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIX.&#xD;
In a short time after Sadia had told the frowsy-&#xD;
haired woman that she wished to see Captain&#xD;
Michel, steps were heard before the door&#xD;
of the little state-room in, which the poor'&#xD;
girl was confined-the key was turned in the&#xD;
lock, and Michel, dressed with elaborate care,&#xD;
and bowing very low, presented himself.&#xD;
" iadamoiselle, 'ave -do me ze honare to say&#xD;
she wish for to see me !" said the Frenchman,&#xD;
bowing very gracefully.    r&#xD;
"I have seen you before, at my father's&#xD;
house, have I not " asked Sadia, glancing with&#xD;
a cold and stately look at the mau.&#xD;
. "I 'ave had ze honare to be present to you,&#xD;
Madamoiselle, in ze house of your very excellent&#xD;
fazzare !"&#xD;
"Then, Sir, I have to ask, why I have been&#xD;
subjected to this cruel outrage ?"&#xD;
"Outrage?- Ma'mse!le, I do not understand&#xD;
you. Outrage? Has anybody dare for to in-j&#xD;
suit you upon ze board of my steamboat ?"&#xD;
"1Do you not call it an outrage, Sir, to have&#xD;
me seized in the streets of Baltimore, when i&#xD;
was going, as I supposed, upon a mission of&#xD;
humanity ; and by some means, I know not&#xD;
what, to stupify and render me helpless, and&#xD;
thus to carry mee away from my friends, as you&#xD;
are now doing?"&#xD;
From your friends, Ma'mselle ?  Excuse me,&#xD;
but you make one grand mistake ! You are&#xD;
going to your friends-friends who 'ave feel one&#xD;
very grand anxiety -while you was absent from&#xD;
zem !" '&#xD;
"Friends!   I suppose you use that false&#xD;
term in allsion to either Randolph Beverly, or&#xD;
ny brother !"&#xD;
- Certainement, Ma'mselle !  Zey 'ave feel&#xD;
one intense anxiety for ze safely of yourself, es-&#xD;
peciaily Messieur Beverly! He wiil be so de-&#xD;
light when he shall see you, zat he will gibe me,&#xD;
at ze very least, four or five toisands of ze dol-&#xD;
lare !"&#xD;
"I thought so !" said Sadia, in a scornful tone,&#xD;
while a look of contempt almost madeMichel&#xD;
shrink  back  before  her haughty ~glance.&#xD;
" Money   alone could tempt a being call-&#xD;
ing Liimseif a mar' to commit such a base&#xD;
outrage upon a poor helpless girl, and to tet'r&#xD;
ber away Ii em th little brother and sist r who&#xD;
are now left helpless among the strangers in the&#xD;
great city."&#xD;
" Mawisellc, I entreat zat you will not be un-&#xD;
happy about z. m ! I will in one short time re-&#xD;
&#xD;
turn to Baltimore, and zen I will procure zem&#xD;
for you wizout fail !" said Michel, bowing very&#xD;
humbly.&#xD;
When did you see m' brother last ?"&#xD;
"About five or six weeks, by gone, Ma'me&#xD;
selle !"&#xD;
" Whera ?"&#xD;
"In Virginia, Ma'mselle--as also Messieur&#xD;
Beverly, and in one very few hours I shall gee-&#xD;
zem again, and 'ave ze honare to sav zat ze&#xD;
beautiful Ma'mselle. De Montfort is safe wia&#xD;
zeno."&#xD;
Not if I can help it, Sir-rwarn you ! There&#xD;
is not a man on earth whom I hold in such utter&#xD;
abhorrence as I do that Randulp1h Beverly. And&#xD;
you may rest assured that I as utterly despise&#xD;
the minions who disgrace the name of manhood&#xD;
by serving him-cowards, miserable cowards&#xD;
that they are !"&#xD;
A deep flush of anger suffused .the face of&#xD;
Michel, in spite of his self-command. And for&#xD;
an instant he made no reply, waiting until le&#xD;
was more under control before he spoke. At last&#xD;
he said&#xD;
I am   very miserable zat while I try to&#xD;
please and serve my old friends Messieurs de&#xD;
Montfort and leverly, zat I 'ave also to incur ze&#xD;
mortel displeasure of you, Ma'mselle ! I sink&#xD;
when you 'ave make zis voyage, an i observe&#xD;
how very particular I shall be to be honorable,&#xD;
and make all sings comfortable for you, Ma'm-&#xD;
selle, you will change your opinion of me ! A&#xD;
chevalier of la belle France, Ma'mselle, cannot&#xD;
be a coward-he cannot do dishionare."&#xD;
"A chevalier of France would never make it&#xD;
his business to abduct a poor helpless girl, who&#xD;
at the peril of life had fled from persecution-&#xD;
who had, after suffering many hardships, once&#xD;
escaped the very persecutions to which you are&#xD;
dragging me back. Call not youself a cheva-&#xD;
lier of France, Sir, while you are the acknowl-&#xD;
edtred hireling of the persecutors of an oroban&#xD;
girl. You a man! Go, Sir, leave me ! Let me,&#xD;
at least, be alone in my misery !,,&#xD;
"Mon Dieu, Ma'msele-you are too severe !&#xD;
I present myself because yout send for me. and&#xD;
now you drive me from you niz one contempt,&#xD;
as if I was one dog ! If you were one m, an-'&#xD;
sacre-if you were one man, I would feed ze fish&#xD;
of ze sea upon your body !"&#xD;
And the Frenchman, too argry to preserve&#xD;
bis attempted composure, dashed the state-room&#xD;
door to, locked it, and went away, swearing&#xD;
bitterly.-&#xD;
CHAPTER L.&#xD;
It was afternoon of the same day, and Mi'hel,'&#xD;
whose long acquaintance with the Chesapeake&#xD;
and the rivers emptying thereinto made him 3n&#xD;
excellent pilot on its waters, was heading bis&#xD;
vessel toward the mouth of the York Eiver,&#xD;
hoping to make as successful . run this time  a&#xD;
I.e had done before.&#xD;
&#xD;
\&#xD;
&#xD;
SADIA,&#xD;
&#xD;
But as he glanced inland through his tele-&#xD;
scope, he saw something which brought a flush&#xD;
of mingled anger and disappointment over his&#xD;
scarred countenance.&#xD;
"Sacre !" he muttered through his grating&#xD;
teeth. "I believe zere is one of zem Yen-&#xD;
kee gunboats zere in ze mouth of ze rivare.&#xD;
I like not zat. Zis boat can run fast ; but&#xD;
for fight wizout ze gun, she is no good for&#xD;
nossimg! If zat is a Yankee gunboat, I must&#xD;
run by and wait for ze night; zen, maybe, in&#xD;
ze dark, I can give him ze slip. When zey&#xD;
catch Carl Michel asleep, zen zey are smart-!"&#xD;
Michel, after these remarks, looked for a&#xD;
short time anxiously toward the vessel that had&#xD;
attracted his attention ; and then, fully satisfied&#xD;
of her character, he ordered the helmsman to&#xD;
head the boat down the bay, and ring the bell&#xD;
for the engineer to run her slow.&#xD;
"She will sink zat I am bound for Fort Mon-&#xD;
roe or to ze sea," he said to himself; "and I&#xD;
will keep on zat course slow until ze night, and&#xD;
zen I come back."&#xD;
"Is there not another vessel on the larboard&#xD;
bow, yonder ?" asked the helmsman, pointing&#xD;
to a vessel well out in the bay.&#xD;
"Yes ; but zat is flossing. Somebody zat is&#xD;
bound for Baltimore," said Michel, carelessly.&#xD;
"And there is another one coming up, further&#xD;
in shore."&#xD;
"Yes; very likely, anozzer one bound ze&#xD;
same way. I care not for zem. We are not&#xD;
known down here, and can pass for a transport&#xD;
anywhere, except when we try for run ze block-&#xD;
ade. Run up ze Yankee-doodale flag zere, one&#xD;
of you mess !"&#xD;
The American flag was hoisted, and the&#xD;
steamer moved on slowly ; Michel pacing to&#xD;
and fro on the upper deck, every little while&#xD;
raising his glass to his eye, and looking at the&#xD;
gunboat in the mouth of the river, which, evi-'&#xD;
dently, had steam up.&#xD;
" Sacre! she is coming out to cut us off!"&#xD;
he muttered, angrily. "Ring ze bell for make&#xD;
ze boat go more fast, zere !"&#xD;
:The order was obeyed, and the steamer moved&#xD;
more rapidly through the water.&#xD;
Michel now looked anxiously at the gunboat,&#xD;
which, though evidently yet out of range, was&#xD;
now coming toward him under a full head of&#xD;
steam. And his face flushed angrily when she&#xD;
fired one of her heavy guns, which, though the&#xD;
ball could not reach him, would serve to call&#xD;
the attention of other vessels to him.&#xD;
And as he looked quickly at the vessel before&#xD;
spoken of as on his larboard bow, he saw, to his&#xD;
great annoyance, that she was on his weather-&#xD;
beam now-indeed, rather abaft it-and had&#xD;
altered her course, and was running directly&#xD;
toward him!&#xD;
" Sacre! Mil diables !" he muttered ; "ze&#xD;
ozzare one is a gunboat, too, and now zey both&#xD;
chase me ! Zia boat draw no more zan eight&#xD;
&#xD;
feet of ze wattare. I will run close to ze shore,&#xD;
where zey cannot come."&#xD;
And he gave the man at the wheel once more&#xD;
orders to change her course, and went himself&#xD;
to the engineer, to tell him to put on every&#xD;
pound of steam that could be carried.&#xD;
All hands were now on deck, and anxious&#xD;
faces told that they well knew the danger they&#xD;
were in.:      f&#xD;
" Cap'n, what does this fellow look like that&#xD;
is coming up the coast ?" asked the helmsman.&#xD;
Michel turned his glass in that direction, and&#xD;
stamped upon the deck in anger as he did so.&#xD;
"Sacre ! it is anozzare of zem Yankee-doo-&#xD;
dale gunboats !" he yelled. "We shall be&#xD;
prisonare, and lose our cargo and our boat !&#xD;
Sacre ! nevare was such miserable fortune !"&#xD;
"Can't we run ashore, and save ourselves in&#xD;
the life-boats ?" asked Hoyle.&#xD;
"Zat is our only chance ; but zen it is toe&#xD;
bad zat we must lose ze cargo and ze boat be-&#xD;
fore we make one trip. If I had guns, I would&#xD;
fight till I diel"&#xD;
"if we can get the lady on shore, we will, at&#xD;
least, save what we were to have for her," said&#xD;
Hoyle.&#xD;
" Yes ; zat is so. You 'ave ze boats all&#xD;
ready for to lower quick, soon. Steer right for&#xD;
ze snore zere, you man at ze wheel! I will get&#xD;
ze lady ready for ze start. Zem gunboats begia&#xD;
for fire, as if zey all knew who we are! Like&#xD;
not zis-I like not zis, at all!"&#xD;
And the unhappy Frenchman hurried below&#xD;
to see Sadia.&#xD;
CHAPTER LI&#xD;
Sadia had noticed the excitement and the&#xD;
hurried tramping of men overhead for some&#xD;
time ; and, looking from her little window f'ora&#xD;
which she could see the shore, she had seem&#xD;
that the steamer changed her course several&#xD;
times in a very short period. From this she&#xD;
judged that the steamer was pursued, and her&#xD;
brave, true heart began to beat high with hopes&#xD;
of a rescue.&#xD;
And when she saw the gunboat coming out,&#xD;
from the river, and saw the smoke and heard&#xD;
the report of her gun, she went down upon her&#xD;
knees in thankful prayer ; for now she hoped&#xD;
earnestly to be saved from her persecutors, and&#xD;
soon to be restored to the dear little ones&#xD;
whom she had left in Baltimore.&#xD;
She rose to her feet upon hearing heavy foot-&#xD;
steps approaching her door.&#xD;
A moment later, the door was thrown open,&#xD;
and Michel, pale with excitement, and trem--&#xD;
bling with rage, stood before her.&#xD;
"I'ave to request, Ma'mselle, zat you will put&#xD;
upon you your bonnett and your shawl, and&#xD;
come upon ze deck wiz me !"&#xD;
"I am very comfortable here, just now, Sir,"&#xD;
she said, with a quiet smile.&#xD;
" Nevare mind zat, I must desire your pres-&#xD;

SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
enee upon ze deck!''he said, impatiently. "And&#xD;
zat Wizout delay !"&#xD;
"Have you anything up there that will in-&#xD;
terest we, Sir?"&#xD;
"Yes, you can see one, two, tree, Yankee&#xD;
dobdale gunboat try to catch me, Capitaine Carl&#xD;
Michel!"&#xD;
"Oh, that will be beautiful ! I will go direct-&#xD;
ly with you !" she cried, as if delighted with the&#xD;
idea.&#xD;
"And acre, you shall see your disappoint!&#xD;
Zey shall neizer take you, nor shall zey take&#xD;
me !" he cried, angrily. " You shall see your&#xD;
disappoint, charming Ma'mselle !"&#xD;
Sadia made no reply, but dressed herself for&#xD;
the visit on deck, and waving himsto lead the&#xD;
way, said :&#xD;
Go on, Sir, I will follow you to the deck, to&#xD;
see once more the blessed flag of my country."&#xD;
Michel went on deck, and the moment he&#xD;
was there he.cried to one of his men:&#xD;
"Haul down zat miserable Yankee doodale&#xD;
flag and put up ze flag of ze grand Confeder-&#xD;
acie-?"&#xD;
And as this was dog he looked triumphantly&#xD;
toward Sadia, to see what effect that would have&#xD;
upon her.&#xD;
She smiled and said: "It is right that you&#xD;
hoist the traitorous flag, Sir, to show wham you&#xD;
serve. It does not pain me, for it will soon be&#xD;
lowered in disgrace."&#xD;
"Not while you are on ze board of z:s boat,&#xD;
Ma'inselle !" said Michel, angrily. "Do you&#xD;
see how fast we go to ze shore? In some lit-&#xD;
tle time zis boat will run upon ze ground, and&#xD;
zen wiz ze small boat we will go upon ze land&#xD;
where ze beautiful flag of ze Co'unfederacie wave&#xD;
,all ze time in triumph !"&#xD;
"1 doubt much whether your boat is allowed&#xD;
to reach the shore !" said Sadia, exultingly, as a&#xD;
heavy shot from the nearest pursuing steamer&#xD;
hured through the air close to them.&#xD;
"Only ten more of ze minutes and we will&#xD;
be zere," replied Michel.&#xD;
Another ring of smoke from the pursuing&#xD;
steamer, and a round shot passed not ten feet&#xD;
over their heads, carrying away the flag-staff&#xD;
and lowering the Rebel colors in a hurry.&#xD;
Michel and most of the crew bobbed their&#xD;
heads as the shot screamed through the air so&#xD;
close to them; but Sadia unmoved, with a proud&#xD;
smile, pointed to the flag which lay drooping&#xD;
on the deck, and said :&#xD;
"Your flag has come down in a hurry, Cap-&#xD;
tain Michel! Are you not going to hoist it&#xD;
again?"&#xD;
t"No time to bozzare wiz zat now! One lit-&#xD;
tle minute more and we shall be upon ze&#xD;
ground !" cried Michel.&#xD;
"And, by thunder, none too soon-there's&#xD;
another boat in range and opening on us. The&#xD;
sooner we are out of this, the better I'm&#xD;
pleased," cried Hoyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
At that moment the boat touched, with a&#xD;
heavy jar, then forged ahead a few lengths,&#xD;
touched again, and then grounded solid.&#xD;
"Stop the engine and lower the boats I"&#xD;
shouted Michel.&#xD;
The crew sprung to obey his orders, and the&#xD;
firemen and engineers hurried  ti! from  be-&#xD;
low. Their part of the work was done on that&#xD;
boat.&#xD;
"Come, Ma'mselle !" said Michel, hastily, as&#xD;
the first boat touched the water. b Ze shore is&#xD;
but a little way-we will soon be zere. Come&#xD;
to ze boat if you please "&#xD;
"I do not please, Sir !" said Sad in, haughtily.&#xD;
"I prefer to remain here until loyal men come&#xD;
to offer their services to me!"&#xD;
"Sacre, Ma'mselle, please or not please,&#xD;
you must go in ze boat !" cried Michel, angrily.&#xD;
"I must lose my boat and my cargo, but I will&#xD;
not lose you and ze five tousand dollars for&#xD;
you! You must come wiz me&#xD;
And he advanced toward her to seize her.&#xD;
" Halt, Sir ! halt, if you value life !" she&#xD;
cried, sternly, drawing the revolver from her&#xD;
pocket and cocking it.&#xD;
IHe hesitated, only, however, to measure his&#xD;
distance, for he intended  to spring suddenly&#xD;
upon her. But this attempt was prevented,&#xD;
and perhaps his life saved, by the sudden action&#xD;
of floyle, who stood behind Sadia, and who,&#xD;
unexpectedly to her, stepped lightly up to her,&#xD;
and wrenched the weapon from her band before&#xD;
she could use it.&#xD;
In. a moment, now, she was seized by Michel&#xD;
and another man, and in spite of her struggles&#xD;
borne to. the boat. And in less time than I&#xD;
take to describe it, every man from the steamer&#xD;
was embarked in the two boats, and they were&#xD;
puliing hurriedly to the shore, now but a short&#xD;
distance off.&#xD;
The gunboats. which dared not to approach&#xD;
too near in consequence of the shoal water,&#xD;
kept up a heavy fire ; but the boats were no-t&#xD;
struck, and in a few moments reached the&#xD;
shore.&#xD;
"Now, sacre ! ze Yankee-dood ale 'ave not&#xD;
catch Carl Michel l' shouted the Fr nehman, as&#xD;
he sprang out on the beach, lifting the half.&#xD;
senseless girl from  the boat at the same&#xD;
time.&#xD;
" Surrender, 'you infernal Rebs !"_ shouted a&#xD;
commanding voice at that instant, and Sadia&#xD;
uttered a scream of joy as she saw a party of&#xD;
eighteen or twenty men, with an American gui-&#xD;
don floating among them, gallop forward from&#xD;
the shelter of the woods near the beach.&#xD;
"Sacre-we must: fight !" shouted Michel,&#xD;
as he saw that the party of Federal cavalry&#xD;
was not large. And be drew a pistol from&#xD;
his belt and fired it at the leader of the&#xD;
party.&#xD;
" Pretty well aimed, but not in time to save&#xD;
yourself !" cried the leader, strikiD  a terri&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
[&#xD;
&#xD;
ble blow with his sabre, which clove the head&#xD;
of the bold smuggler entirely asunder.&#xD;
And at the same time he reeled and fell from&#xD;
his saddle close by the side of Sadia, for&#xD;
the bullet from Michel's pistol had entered his&#xD;
;ide.&#xD;
"'Heavens-it is Mr. Armand !" cried Sadia,&#xD;
recognizing the Sergeant whom she had met at&#xD;
the house of Mr. VV Inter, in Baltimore. ,&#xD;
"Oh, I pray you are not fatally wounded !"&#xD;
she cried, as, forgetting he. own danger, she&#xD;
tried to raise him.&#xD;
"I care not, if I have saved you from peril!"&#xD;
said Armand, pressing his hand to his side to&#xD;
check the bleeding, and giving the order to his&#xD;
men not to mind his position, but to capture&#xD;
the Rebels.&#xD;
And this would have been done g a few mo-&#xD;
ments more, had not a new and powerful inter-&#xD;
vention occurred. A bugle sounding the charge&#xD;
broke upon their ears,.and two or three squad-&#xD;
rons of rebel cavalry came dashing down upon&#xD;
the scanty force of lederals.&#xD;
The latter resisted for a moment, but against&#xD;
such numbers it was in vain; and soon all who&#xD;
survived of Sergeant Armand's scouting-party&#xD;
were prisoners.&#xD;
wWhom have we here !" cried the command-&#xD;
ing officer of the Rebels. "Why, there is poor&#xD;
Michel a3 dead as a nail !" he added, in sur-&#xD;
j'rise.&#xD;
"And here, father, is Miss De Montfort-her&#xD;
brother will be surprised at this event 1" cried&#xD;
Kate Stuart, for her father was the leader of the&#xD;
party.&#xD;
"pte careful, there, men. You need not ride&#xD;
over that lady in your awkwardness !" she added.&#xD;
And dismounting, the brave girl hurried to&#xD;
the side of Sadia and said, in a low tone&#xD;
"Do not be disheartened, my dear girl-you&#xD;
have a friend in me, now, as before !"&#xD;
"Oh, save him, if you can! I fear he is&#xD;
morally  wounded!1" said Sadia, pointing to&#xD;
Armand, whose head she had raised, for he had&#xD;
fainted.&#xD;
Kate looked at the wound, and binding, a&#xD;
scarf which she took from her waist over the&#xD;
wound, she said, quietly :&#xD;
" He bleeds bauly, but I think it is only a&#xD;
severe flesh-wound. He will not die&#xD;
"Come daughter, get Miss De; Montfort in a&#xD;
saddle some way- we must be out of here, ,fo&#xD;
those gunboats will be throwing shell here be'&#xD;
fore we know it!" cried Colonel Stuart.&#xD;
"She can idile behind  me-here Montrose&#xD;
you and some other careful man take thi&#xD;
wounded Sergeant in charge, and be as easy&#xD;
with him as possible !" cried Kate. "Come&#xD;
Iiss Sadia, Ile one of the men help you u&#xD;
behind mc. He shall be carefully cared for, i&#xD;
you are interested in him !"&#xD;
And the wild girl smiled as she pointed t&#xD;
Armand.&#xD;
&#xD;
87&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ile is almost a stranger to me. but he&#xD;
was wounded while tr\ ink to rescue me from.&#xD;
ruffianly bands !" said Sadia, blushing, as she&#xD;
was lifted to a seat behind Kate.&#xD;
A shell from one of the gunboats dropping&#xD;
almost in their midst, and killing two or three&#xD;
of Stuart's men as well as more than half of the&#xD;
men who had escaped from the Lone Star with&#xD;
Michel, now  significantly  warned  Colonel&#xD;
Stuart that the sooner lie was out of range&#xD;
the better.&#xD;
As the prisoners were already secured, the&#xD;
order to gallop was given, and soon only the&#xD;
dead occupied the beach.&#xD;
When they had ridden out of sight of the&#xD;
vessels, Sadia, who had not spoken before, said&#xD;
to Kate :&#xD;
"When you first recognized me, you spoke of&#xD;
my brother. Where is beenow ?.'&#xD;
"In command of one of our battalions, out in&#xD;
another direction to dv !" said Kate. "We&#xD;
will find him in camp at head-quarters, before&#xD;
long."&#xD;
"I do not wish to see him. I was happy&#xD;
where I was in Baltimore !" said Sadia, sadly.&#xD;
" Well, do not fret, my dear girl. You shall&#xD;
find a true friend in Kate Stuart, no matter&#xD;
what others may be !" said the Rebel leader's&#xD;
daughter. "Keep as easy as you can and&#xD;
hope for the best!"&#xD;
CHAPTER LI[.&#xD;
It was a ride of twenty miles, or more, to the&#xD;
camp of Colons Stuart/s Regiment-a weary&#xD;
ride, indeed, to poor Sadia, but it was soon&#xD;
passed over, for the Rebels had advanced very&#xD;
far toward the Federal line on that day, and did&#xD;
not'know soon they might be pursued. During&#xD;
the rapid ride, Kate endeavored to cheer up&#xD;
her companion; but Sadia, brave-hearted as she&#xD;
was, could not but feel despondent as she&#xD;
thought of the distance from her friends in&#xD;
Baltimore, and the dependent position in which&#xD;
her little brother and sister must now be&#xD;
placed.&#xD;
Upon their arrival at the camp,' Kate con-&#xD;
ducted Sadia to her own tent, and bade her&#xD;
make herself feel perfectly easy.&#xD;
"My wardrobe is not very extensive " .she&#xD;
said, with a gay laugh. "But such as it is, I&#xD;
hope you will make use of it "&#xD;
r   "Many thanks for your kindness. I need it&#xD;
sadly !" said Sadia, with a sigh.&#xD;
"Do not sigh so heavily. You'll give me&#xD;
, the blues! The Sergeant is in a fair way to&#xD;
s recover. I wish be was a colonel, for your&#xD;
y sake !" said Kate, in a lively tone.&#xD;
"The Sergeant is nothing to me, except a&#xD;
p kind friend, in whom I feel interested, because&#xD;
f he was wounded in trying-to serve me !" said&#xD;
Sadia. "Youdo not seem to think of the real&#xD;
o peril which I dread. You know what I risked&#xD;
so much to fly from before !"&#xD;

SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Yes, the persecutions of that puppy-heart-&#xD;
ed cousin of yours, LieutenantBeverly! I saw&#xD;
him the other day, but he kept his distance&#xD;
from me. He looks upon me as a regular&#xD;
"Is he near here now?"&#xD;
"Not far away! He commands a tub that&#xD;
he calls a gunboat, on the York River,a few&#xD;
miles from here !"&#xD;
"lIt was he who bribed Michel to abduct me&#xD;
from the quiet home in Baltimore, where I was&#xD;
so happy, supporting myself and my orphan&#xD;
brother and sister by my own industry~!"&#xD;
"I expected as much. I knew that lie and&#xD;
MicheLwere together when the latter made his&#xD;
first successful smuggling-trip. It is likely&#xD;
that you will soon have a visit from him, for&#xD;
news of captures flies fast i. this country-it is&#xD;
so seldom we make any, that we let all the Con-&#xD;
federacy hear of it when we do make one !"&#xD;
"Oh, can I not be relieved from his persecu-&#xD;
tion !" sighed Sadia.&#xD;
"bYes; leave that to me. If you want to go&#xD;
baek to Baltimore, you shall, if Kate Stuart pos-&#xD;
sesses either wit or courage-and her friends&#xD;
think she has a little of both qualities. If your&#xD;
brother comes, as he will before I can do any&#xD;
thing in the way of sending you off, take mat-&#xD;
ters coolly, as if you had made up your mind to&#xD;
submit to what apparently cannot be helped.&#xD;
If Lieutenant Beverly comes, I'll make the camp&#xD;
too hot to hold him! Though I say it, I am&#xD;
the idol of my father, and the men will do my&#xD;
bidding in anything and everything !"&#xD;
"I shall depend upon you thin, kind Kate!"&#xD;
said Sadia, smiling, though her eyes were yet&#xD;
tearful-a kind of sunlight through rain.&#xD;
"You can do so, my friend. Can you ride&#xD;
well, alone?"&#xD;
"Oh yes ; I have been used to riding on&#xD;
horseback ever since I was quite small !"&#xD;
"Then you can make up your mind to take a&#xD;
longand pretty rapid ride one of these nights.&#xD;
Maybe i11 send a cavalier with you; but that&#xD;
depends upon circumstances. I'd escort you&#xD;
myself, but I am almost too well known within&#xD;
the Federal lines. If the Yankees had wild Kate&#xD;
Stuart instheir hands, they would nrt be apt to&#xD;
let her go as easily as I intend you shall&#xD;
go!I"&#xD;
"Surely they do not war on women !"&#xD;
"No, not without a woman plays man, and&#xD;
acts the devil among them, as I do occasional-&#xD;
y;riding in upon' their pickets and shooting&#xD;
down some of them before they forget their gal-&#xD;
lant notion about our gentle sex and return my&#xD;
fire. For in spite of my dress they can see thatI&#xD;
I am a woman-my hair and compnJexion, or,&#xD;
perhaps, my voicewhen I cry, 'Charge!' makes'&#xD;
them know me. But, my dear girl, are you not1&#xD;
hungry-Ihforgot ou~r bacon, which must bet&#xD;
ready by this time!"&#xD;
Sadia could not deny that she was actually&#xD;
&#xD;
feint from hunger, or she had eaten nothing&#xD;
since the supper taken in Baltimore ; and wom-&#xD;
an, angelic as we may deem her, must eat or&#xD;
perish, like we coarse-grained and most un-&#xD;
angelic men.&#xD;
And she exhibited a very fair appetite when&#xD;
in platters of fried bacon and roasted sweet-&#xD;
potat-es and tin cups of strong coffee graced&#xD;
the table ofbher fair hostess ; for though Kate&#xD;
fought side by side with her fher aid his men,&#xD;
she lived exclusively alone as it was posi-&#xD;
b le.&#xD;
CHAPTER LIII.&#xD;
Sadia had but just finished supper when the&#xD;
tread of horses and the sound of a bugle were&#xD;
heard.&#xD;
"Some more of our men have come in. Very&#xD;
likely the battalion which your brother took&#xD;
out!" said Kate, whose ear, accustonei to such&#xD;
sounds, at once detected the nature of'the ar-&#xD;
rival.&#xD;
Her conjecture proved true; for, in a few mo-&#xD;
ments, Warourton De Montfort, dressed in the&#xD;
gay uniform of the Rebel service, entered the&#xD;
tent where they were seated. Doffing his cap&#xD;
and bowing very low to Kate, as he bWde her&#xD;
good evening, he said to his sister, in a tone as&#xD;
cold as his rooks :&#xD;
"I welcome Miss De Montfort back once more&#xD;
to the Confederate States !"&#xD;
Sadia looked at him with a glace in which&#xD;
it could be plainly seen that sisterly affection&#xD;
had not entirely fled from her heart, cruelly as&#xD;
she had been treated, and she replied:&#xD;
"I am   glad to see that you are yet alive,&#xD;
brother Warburton; but I assure you that I&#xD;
had much rather have been left alone in peace,&#xD;
in the home of my own seeking !"&#xD;
" Pshaw, girl-it was no place for you among&#xD;
strangers !" said Major De Montfort, h:.stily.&#xD;
"Those strangers were more kind to me than&#xD;
my own kindred !" replied Salia, quietly.&#xD;
You have given me no chance to be kind to&#xD;
you 1" replied the brother. " You fled away&#xD;
from my care when I was at Springland, and&#xD;
even took off all the negroes, intending to de-&#xD;
liver them over to the infernal Abolitionists !&#xD;
But, as good luck turned out, I got them back,&#xD;
and they are now where the negro-worshipers&#xD;
may look for then in vain!"&#xD;
"Sold, I suppose-the very people whom you&#xD;
have heard our father say he intended to free,&#xD;
and whom he would have freed had not death&#xD;
so suddenly came upon him 1"&#xD;
"Yes, sold ! and their price invested in good&#xD;
Confederate bonds !" said Warburton, with a&#xD;
sneering laugh. "So that, after all, you and that&#xD;
miserable old thief, Tom Hunter, failed in your&#xD;
great undertaking. I'm glad that he lost his&#xD;
worthless life !"&#xD;
"And I regret it. Thank Heaven that your&#xD;
cruelty has-not extended to poor Napoleon and&#xD;
&#xD;
eynthia-they, at least, are free and in comfort,&#xD;
redeiving pay f'o t.eir labor, and living mide-&#xD;
pendently bessse.''&#xD;
"You   cedno; .ia    too much of that.&#xD;
traitress !'' cried Warhur',on, angrily. "Now&#xD;
that you are secured, M:.hel will have little dif-&#xD;
ficulty in getting the children and the two ne-&#xD;
groes to follow you."&#xD;
"You will have to go into a hotter place than&#xD;
this to find Michel--he has been called home&#xD;
by his Satanic master !" said Sadia, in a quiet&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
"Yes-his head was like '   Union, when I&#xD;
saw it last--completely diiided !" said Kate,&#xD;
with a malicious smile.&#xD;
"What, Michel killed? I did not hear of&#xD;
that!" said Warburton.&#xD;
"Yes, thank Heaven for ridding the earth of&#xD;
such a villain !" said Sadia. "You and Ran-&#xD;
dolph Beverly have lost your most useful tool&#xD;
in him."&#xD;
"A tool, Miss?  Look out that we do not&#xD;
find worse tools than he was ! If you had jus-&#xD;
tice done you, you would rot in jail for nigger-&#xD;
stealing."&#xD;
"Major De Montfort, you must not forget&#xD;
where you are,rSir !" said Kate, sternly, while&#xD;
her eyes flashed angrily. "If you forget the&#xD;
common courtesy due from all gentlemen in the&#xD;
presence of ladies, you must not blame me for&#xD;
reminding you of it. . And, Sir, whether she be&#xD;
considered as a prisoner or a guest, Miss Sadia&#xD;
belongs to me, and not to you! An~d I will not&#xD;
permit her to be insulted or annoyed while she&#xD;
is here! Understand that !"&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, Miss Stuart," said War-&#xD;
burton, testily. "The language of the girl was&#xD;
enough to provoke a saint."&#xD;
"Therefore, it should not have provoked Major&#xD;
Warburton De Montfort," said Kate, in a sarcas-&#xD;
tic tone, "for I never heard of his possessing&#xD;
any very saintly qualities."&#xD;
"'Good evening, Miss Date," said the Majpr,&#xD;
now fairly angry. "I will see that you are not&#xD;
long put to the trouble of entertaining my sis-&#xD;
ter, either as a prisoner or a guest."&#xD;
And be turned away from the tent, trembling&#xD;
with passion.&#xD;
"0   dear Kate, how can I repay you for so&#xD;
;tobly taking my part!" cried Sadia, the woman&#xD;
a her exhibiting itself in the usual way-id est,&#xD;
issuingg Kate, and shedding a shower of tears."&#xD;
"There - th re-don't cry.   I sinppose the&#xD;
retch-I must call him so, if he is your bro-&#xD;
&amp;amp;er-will try to geyou out of my care. Do&#xD;
ou think you will be strong enough for a mid-&#xD;
ight ride ?"&#xD;
"0Oh yes - I am quite strong now," said&#xD;
.dia, eagerly.&#xD;
"Well, I will see if I can find an escort for&#xD;
.u. It is possible that there may be two pris-&#xD;
ers less in this camp before morning," said&#xD;
ate. "Excuse me while I go out and see what&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
preparations I can make, and what state your&#xD;
Sergeant is in."&#xD;
CHAPTER LIV.&#xD;
Kate was not absent a great while. When&#xD;
she came back, a radiant smile made her hand.&#xD;
some face look more-than usually beautiful.&#xD;
"Fortune favor s the brave, my dear, Miss&#xD;
Sadia," she said, in a low tone. " Your brother&#xD;
has applied for leave until t.o-morrow,morning,&#xD;
and has ridden off in the- direction of York&#xD;
River, intending, doubtless, to take counsel with&#xD;
the immortal Beverly, upon the ways of taming&#xD;
tiger-cat me, and bringing your lovely self into&#xD;
proper subjection. -So be is out of the way fox&#xD;
the night. The officer of the day is a young&#xD;
fool that is in love with me, and will wink at any&#xD;
of my oddities, in passing out foragers for my&#xD;
own especial table, and the like of that. Now,&#xD;
can you wear men's clothes, upon 'this occasion&#xD;
only', as they say in the show-bills ?" .&#xD;
"With such an example as you set, if my&#xD;
safety depends upon it, it would be worse than&#xD;
prudery to decline to do so !" replied Sadia,&#xD;
while the thought brought a blush of modesty&#xD;
to her cheek.&#xD;
"I will rig you up in my own uniform-I&#xD;
'have a spare one," said Irate, gayly ; "and&#xD;
then provide you with Federal overcoats, or&#xD;
you'll be shot by their pickets before you have a&#xD;
chance to tell them who you are. And now,&#xD;
dear, dont blush, I have still better news for&#xD;
you, your Sergeant is so far out of danger&#xD;
that he will undertake the task of escorting you&#xD;
to the Federal lines. Once inside of there,your&#xD;
return to Baltimore will be easy."&#xD;
"O dear, kind Kate, God will reward you,&#xD;
for I never can."&#xD;
"I ask no reward, my dear girl, but the satis-&#xD;
faction of serving you, and of punishing that&#xD;
pusillanimous puppy, Randolph Beverly. He&#xD;
will go raving mad when lie finds that, you have&#xD;
escaped, after being so nearly in his power; and&#xD;
I expect your brother will have worse than the&#xD;
dumb ague when he discovers your absence.&#xD;
They wi.l be terribly angry with me, but they&#xD;
4 - e not go any 'further; for my father is too&#xD;
much ofa man to see a woman persecuted, and&#xD;
he has few hospital accommodations, and will&#xD;
not blame me for letting your wounded Ser-&#xD;
geant go."&#xD;
"Kate, you do love to tease me in calling that&#xD;
poor Armand mine, whom I have never seen&#xD;
but twice in my life 1"&#xD;
"Well, his heart is yours at any rate, say&#xD;
what you may ; for when I asked him if he was&#xD;
strong enough to protect you in a midnight&#xD;
ride to the Federal lines, he said that he was&#xD;
strong enough to die for you, angel that you&#xD;
was! Now, a man doesn't want to die for a&#xD;
woman without he loves her. And now don't&#xD;
feel bad-I know -he is only a sergeant, but he&#xD;
is brave enough to be a general; and better&#xD;

than all, one can see at a glance that he is aI&#xD;
gentleman born and bred. If he wasn't an&#xD;
enemy to the Confederacy, I'd take him off your&#xD;
hands myself, my lady, if you couldn't appreci-&#xD;
ate him "&#xD;
"I am sure I appreciate his kind devotion,"&#xD;
said Sadia, with a smile. "But one can appre-&#xD;
ciate without loving, can they not 2"&#xD;
"Not if they're as demonstrative as I am,"&#xD;
said Kate, with a laugh. "But a truce to this&#xD;
nonsense. I must think of getting you ready,&#xD;
for itis already well on in the night. Can you&#xD;
shoot a pistol ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I have 'practiced with pistols for&#xD;
amusement. I had one, but it was taken from&#xD;
me on the boat," replied Sadia.&#xD;
"'Well, I will let you have a pair, but don't&#xD;
use them on any of our people, except it be-&#xD;
comes actually necessary to effect your es-&#xD;
cape!"&#xD;
"You may rest assured that I never would&#xD;
fire upon any human being except when forc-&#xD;
ed to do so in self-defence !"&#xD;
"You are kinder then than I," said Kate,&#xD;
with a laugh, "But come, I must dress you&#xD;
up for your trip!''&#xD;
Of course, reader, modesty will demand our&#xD;
temporary absence now.&#xD;
CHAPTER LV.&#xD;
It was midnight, or thereabout, and all was&#xD;
still in the Rebel camp, when Kate Stuart led&#xD;
Sadia out into the open air from the tent in&#xD;
which she had blown out the light a half-&#xD;
hour before. There was no moon, but the&#xD;
star-light was sufficient for them to see how&#xD;
to avoid the tents, and Sadia moved along in&#xD;
her strange attire silently behind Kate for&#xD;
some distance. They were hailed by only one,&#xD;
sentinel, to whom Kate gave the countersign -&#xD;
and in a few minutes after she whispered to&#xD;
Sadia that they were outside of the precincts&#xD;
of the camp.&#xD;
A walk of near a quarter of a mile along a&#xD;
well-defined and apparently a much-traveled&#xD;
road, brought them to a small grove of leafy&#xD;
pines; and here Kate, cautioning Sadia not to&#xD;
be surprised or to speak low, led the way.&#xD;
A few steps from the road they found two&#xD;
powerful thorough-bred horses standing, held&#xD;
by Sergeant Armand, who, seated upon a log,&#xD;
was resting and waiting for his fair compan-&#xD;
ions. He was fully armed .with a sabre and&#xD;
pistols, and when asked by Kate if all was&#xD;
ready, replied in the affirmative.&#xD;
"Then mount and away, my dear girl," said&#xD;
Kate, kissing Sadia, warmly. "I have given&#xD;
you one of my own horses, and borrowed one&#xD;
from your brother's stable for Mr. Armand.&#xD;
You must keep straight on this road until you&#xD;
reach your pickets, which, if von ride fast,&#xD;
will be by a little after daylight ; that is, if&#xD;
you are not interrupted. By the way, do not&#xD;
&#xD;
forget the countersign if you should meet a&#xD;
patrol on our side, though I know of none be-&#xD;
ing out. It is 'Beauregard'."&#xD;
And giving Sadia one more tong, fervent&#xD;
kiss, which made poor Armand sigh as if he&#xD;
considered such "sweetness wasted" a sacrilege,&#xD;
Kate helped her to mount the spirited horse,&#xD;
aiid led it out into the road.&#xD;
"Good-bye, and God bless you bath," she&#xD;
said, in aloev and tremulous tone  and then she&#xD;
turned toward her father's camp, while they&#xD;
rode rapidly down the road which she had&#xD;
pointed out as their course.&#xD;
For a time, they rode swiftly on in silence.&#xD;
Sadia was the first'to break it.&#xD;
"Does not your wound incommode you very&#xD;
much, Mr. Armand ?" she asked.&#xD;
"More through weakness than pain, kind&#xD;
lady," he replied. "I lost so much blood .be-&#xD;
fore it was stagrnched, yesterday, that my&#xD;
strength is much lessened. But I shall be&#xD;
able to go through, I think; at least, to see you&#xD;
safe inside of our lines. If I fail after that, it&#xD;
will be but little matter !"&#xD;
The utter sadness of his tone touched the&#xD;
heart of Sadia; but the speed at which they&#xD;
were going made conversation difficult, and she&#xD;
did not reply to his words.&#xD;
They did not break a gallop, nor meet with&#xD;
any interruption, before the day broke, when&#xD;
Armand rode at a slower pace, for he said they&#xD;
were now near the Federal lines. He was on&#xD;
ground with which he was acquainted. And&#xD;
the decrease of the rapid pace was agreeable to&#xD;
Sadia ; for, unused to riding so fast and so far,&#xD;
she felt more fatigue than she wished to ac-&#xD;
knowledge to her companion, whose pale cheek&#xD;
and quivering lip told that he was suffering pain&#xD;
which he would not speak of.&#xD;
Arnand now handed Sadia a blue Federal&#xD;
overcoat which Kate Stuart had provided, saying&#xD;
that it was necessary to cover the gray uniform&#xD;
there, or they might get a shot from some am-&#xD;
bushed picket before their character could be&#xD;
understood. And be also put on one which had&#xD;
been provided for him, for Kate hal to make&#xD;
him put on a gray uniform to get him safely out&#xD;
of the Rebel camp.&#xD;
This done, they rode on at an easy gait, look-&#xD;
ing every moment to catch a view of the Fed-&#xD;
eral pickets. But they were doomed to meet a&#xD;
sight not half so welcome. Coming to a turn of&#xD;
the road, they saw at a very short distance, di-&#xD;
rectly in front of them, a body of at leant a&#xD;
dozen horsemen, whose gray uniform at once&#xD;
told that they were Rebel scouts who had been&#xD;
trying to get a peep at the Union lines.&#xD;
"heavens! What shall we do?" said Sadia,&#xD;
in dismay, as she glanced at the fearful odds,&#xD;
and saw, too, that the opposite party had seen&#xD;
and was rearingg to meet them.&#xD;
"There is but one thing to do, lady. I must&#xD;
cut a path through them! Follow me, and&#xD;
&#xD;
SADIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ehioot down the fist man who tries to check&#xD;
your horse. If I fall, ride on, and remember&#xD;
that it is not more than a mile at most to our&#xD;
first picket-sta-tion. Keep a firm seat and be&#xD;
fearless - I will clear a way for you !"&#xD;
And, drawing his sabre, the Sergeant shorten-&#xD;
ed the reins, and then, with one word to his com-&#xD;
panion, to follow directly after him, he dashed&#xD;
his spurs into his horse, and at full speed rushed&#xD;
upo-n the advancing horsemen. The horse upon&#xD;
which Sadia rode needed neither word nor spur;&#xD;
it was too used to the charge. All that she&#xD;
knew was, that she was going' with the speed of&#xD;
the wind upon and among those armed men-&#xD;
she heard a wild, fierce yell from Armaud's&#xD;
lips, she saw his sabre flash from side to side be-&#xD;
fore her, saw men reel and fall, and heard pistol-&#xD;
shots sounding-then they had a free road be-&#xD;
fore them-the Rebels were all behind.&#xD;
But Armand did not check his speed, but&#xD;
kept on until he saw some horsemen with the&#xD;
blue uniform in sight, and then he drew his&#xD;
rein;&#xD;
Sadia now rode up by his side.&#xD;
Were you touched at all, Miss Sadia?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"No-but you?    how pale you are, and you,&#xD;
are bleeding terribly ! O lieaven ! I fear that&#xD;
now you will indeed die !" she ereaimed.&#xD;
"Never in a better cause--never better safis-&#xD;
fi.ld, for now you are with friends, and safe !&#xD;
These pickets are from  my own regiment !" he&#xD;
said, as some of the Union cavalry galloped up&#xD;
to them.&#xD;
What is tke matter, Sergeant-we thought&#xD;
you were lost. Ong of your men who got away&#xD;
yesterday reported you killed !" said the officer&#xD;
commanding the party.&#xD;
"I was taken by the Rebels, yesterday, Lieu-&#xD;
tenant, but escaped last night with .his laiy,&#xD;
who belongs to Baltimore. I resign her to x our&#xD;
kind care, Sir, for my scouting is over!"&#xD;
Halt, men, and help him from the saddle !"&#xD;
cried the offrcer. " lie is fainting i"&#xD;
And the Lieutenant sprung from his saddle&#xD;
and helped to lift Armand to a grassy bank by&#xD;
the roadside.         -&#xD;
Sadia, forgetting everything but the dying&#xD;
condition of her preserver, also sprung to the&#xD;
ground and hastened to his side.&#xD;
" Oh, it is hard-too hard that you should&#xD;
die for me !' "he said, weeping.&#xD;
"It is my only happiness-you and my coun-&#xD;
try were all that I had to-to love !" he&#xD;
gasped.&#xD;
fie tried to speak again, but rising blood&#xD;
choked his utterance. A gasp-one look, un-&#xD;
utterable, but yet saying so much, and he died !&#xD;
That last look was upon Sadia, and shehad been&#xD;
senseless not to know that his soul went up lov-&#xD;
ing her as only such a man could love !&#xD;
Sadia grieved as if she had lost a brother,&#xD;
and it was with broken sobs that she told the&#xD;
&#xD;
91&#xD;
&#xD;
officer her story, and received from hia assur-&#xD;
ance that she should speedily be restored to hey&#xD;
friends in Baltimore.&#xD;
CHAPTER LVI.&#xD;
Mr. Winter was seated in his parlor with hii&#xD;
famdy a few evenings later than that on which&#xD;
occurred the events narrated in the last chap-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
Marion and Carine were there, both sad and&#xD;
sorrowful, for much they missed their dearly.&#xD;
loved sister.&#xD;
"have you heard nothing farther from Fort&#xD;
Monroe, husband, in regard to the lost steamer&#xD;
and poor Sadia ?" asked Mrs. Winter.&#xD;
Only a full confirmation of the news which&#xD;
we first received !" replied the merchant. "The&#xD;
steamer was run on shore by the smugglers,&#xD;
who deserted her, and escaped to the land with a&#xD;
lady, who was undoubtedly poor Sadia. The&#xD;
gunboats took possession of the steamer and&#xD;
succeeded in getting her off, and she is now in&#xD;
the possession of the Government. A party of&#xD;
Rebel cavalry was seen to carry the lady to&#xD;
the interior with them !"&#xD;
"I am afraid I shall never see my dear sister&#xD;
again !" said Marion, mournfully.&#xD;
"Yes, we willF' said Canine, with touching&#xD;
sirrplieity. "I have prayed to God to give her&#xD;
back to us, every night and morning since she&#xD;
has been gone. And sister told me once that&#xD;
pra ;er would always be answered if we were&#xD;
only good. And I have tried to be very good&#xD;
since we lost her!"&#xD;
And as if the holy trust of'that pure young&#xD;
heart should not to unrewarded, a violent ring&#xD;
ing of the door-bell announced a visitor. And&#xD;
in a moment afterward, weeping in the fullness&#xD;
of her joy, Sadia was clasping her young sister&#xD;
to her breast.&#xD;
It is scarcely necessary for me to describe the&#xD;
joyful scene that occurred then and there, or to&#xD;
recount the manner in which Sadia told the&#xD;
tale of her adventures, already known to the&#xD;
reader.&#xD;
It must suffice for me to say, that she accept-&#xD;
ed an offer, made in a manner which would ad-&#xD;
mit of no refusal, thenceforward to make her&#xD;
home in the house of the lknd-hearted mer-&#xD;
chant.&#xD;
CHAPTER LVII._,&#xD;
Under the friendly care of Mrs. Winter,&#xD;
Sadia De Montfort soon recovered from the ex-&#xD;
haustion of body and depression of spirits con-&#xD;
sequent on the afflictions she had so bravely&#xD;
passed through.&#xD;
With throbbing heart and an exclamation of&#xD;
joy, she listened one morning while Mr. Winter&#xD;
cad at the breakfast-table a account f a&#xD;
naval engagement in which Randolph Beverly,&#xD;
at once her lover and her persecutor, met with&#xD;
a fate as just as it was terrible. For the frs&#xD;

time for m y months, she felt the assurance of&#xD;
safety for. erself and her dearly-loved brother&#xD;
and sister.&#xD;
In a skirmish, not long after, her brother,&#xD;
Warburton, received injuries that ultimately&#xD;
led to the amputation of one of his limbs. A&#xD;
prisoner, crestfallen and repentant, he willingly&#xD;
'eceived the attentions of his much-abused sis-&#xD;

&#xD;
Of his brave-hearted daughter, Kate, Sadie&#xD;
sometimes hears, but seldom speaks, and then&#xD;
with a hopeful smile, which shows that some-&#xD;
thing unknown to us is bright in the brave&#xD;
though misguided girl's future. Whatever her&#xD;
fate may be, her goodheartedness toward our&#xD;
heroine deserves perpetual sunshine.&#xD;
And now, with all true-hearted friends and&#xD;
patriots, Sadia and her brother look forward,&#xD;
with firm faith in the right, to the day in which&#xD;
shall be restored to the whole Union peace and&#xD;
prosperity, and to the final triumph which will&#xD;
reinstate them and all loyal Southerners in the&#xD;
