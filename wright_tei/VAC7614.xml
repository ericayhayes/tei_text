THE MAID OF TE1ANCII&#xD;
By Dr. J. H. Robinson.&#xD;
C H A P T E R I..&#xD;
TIlE TWO HUNTERS.--AURICOEl HARPER.&#xD;
THE gentle winds of a cloudless summer morning were sweeps softly over&#xD;
the Texan prairies. Two men in a small boat were floating down the Brazos&#xD;
river, occasionally plying the paddle to direct the movements of their diminu-&#xD;
tive vessel. Both appeared thoughtful, neither in a hurry, but 'surveyed the&#xD;
shore and surrounding scenery with the nonchalance of persons inured to the&#xD;
forest.&#xD;
"The times look rather dubious, and I think that we may.-calculate that&#xD;
there are breakers ahead," said one of the men deliberately.&#xD;
"That's the general opinion, and it requires no loic to find it out;" returned.&#xD;
his -companion.&#xD;
"Perhaps not, and yet there are many who don't seem to realize it, friend&#xD;
Manuel," resumed the first speaker.&#xD;
"There are many stupid people in Texas, as well as elsewhere, Noel Noon,"&#xD;
added Manuel.&#xD;
" The storm will burst on us soon, and I shouldn't "mind havin' a-try at the&#xD;
common enemy myself. A few of our backwoods rifles would tell the blank-&#xD;
etted ruffians an awful story," said Noel, earnestly..&#xD;
"I don't perceive that we need trouble ourselves about this war business. Let .&#xD;
those that want to, fight;it out.- What care weY? The woods are large enough&#xD;
for us ; if there isn't room enough'here, we han fall back to the Rocky Moun-&#xD;
tains, where General Cos and his army wouldn't care, to come.&#xD;
"'You and I differ on this point. I think it our duty to fght for liberty ; be-&#xD;
side's there'll be some sport in'It. T'There's women and children that ought to&#xD;
be defended, too."&#xD;
"Let them that hate w4men and'children tale are of 'em," responded Man-&#xD;
uel, with a slight chuckle.&#xD;

4 You're not exetly the man I took you for, if them's your feelins. I know&#xD;
females that I would fight for to the last gasp. Liberty is sometimes repre.-&#xD;
sented as a woman ; that's very appropriate, for it naturally reminds an honest&#xD;
feller of theibest and fairest portion of creation," rejoined Noel Noon, decid-&#xD;
edly.&#xD;
" Perhaps you're thinking of Iris Rathbun ; it sounds to me oncommonly&#xD;
like it. I've been wantin' to speak my mind to you on that subject for -a long&#xD;
time, and I reckon I might as well do it now, and have it -off my hands. It's&#xD;

Noel Noon's nether lid curled a litle as he replied but otherwise he gave&#xD;
no sign that            g ieooticalni    .&#xD;
" I'm not the man to be frightened by threats, although I can't say that I&#xD;
ever fixed my thoughts on Iris Rathburn, always considerin' her too much my&#xD;
superior to think of her as anything more than a friend; but if it wasn't so,&#xD;
and I aspired to more, all th ehuq e s, trappen apd yillins on 'the Brazos couldn't&#xD;
frighten me off'the trail ; so the least you say on that subject the better."&#xD;
" I'm glad you aint inclined that way, for such things sometimes make trou-&#xD;

good as engaged) and govern yourself accordingly."&#xD;
Noel made nb rply, and the "dug-out floated along in, silence for some mo-&#xD;
ments.-&#xD;
" Have you eveIr seen thatstrange craft that's cruising about in these wa-&#xD;
ters ?" demanded Hart, at length.&#xD;
You allude, if I understand, to that young man who has been seen on the&#xD;
river lately ?" returned his companion.&#xD;
"That's what I mean. Can you say anything good of him I"&#xD;
"I can't say no hurt of him, and that's rather more, I fancy, than can be said&#xD;
of the majority of people living hereabouts."&#xD;
41I hope you ain't ,ubbin' hard on me again, in that quiet speech; but that's&#xD;
neither here nor there. I want to know what you think of the youngsprig.&#xD;
" Well, to, be candid and speak to the point, I like the, lools of him, He's&#xD;
straight as a young oak, and seems about as firn in his makes"&#xD;
"Do you call him good-lookin' ?"&#xD;
"Yes, that's what I was coming' to."&#xD;
"We differ there Noeli he appears, in my eyes ~greeniboy, plaiti, enongh~&#xD;
acd awkward enough, and not experience enough to ;keep him qut f fire and&#xD;
water. He'd be quite likely -to take a moccasin snake for an eel, and a cypress-&#xD;
brake for a Texan plantation."&#xD;
"He carries'a fine rifle and alold front ; and as nice a dog- runs after him&#xD;
as I have seen for a long time."&#xD;
"Rifle indeed I what can;he do with a rifle ? Pshaw I' you talk like a green-&#xD;
horn, Noel Noon. There's no spirit in that chap!; he isn't, fit for this country.&#xD;
He can't stay here !"&#xD;
",n't stay here ?"&#xD;
"uAye, that's the word-ean't "&#xD;
' And why'not ?"&#xD;
" Because he isn't wahted."&#xD;
"Who doii't want him ?"&#xD;
"I don't fdr one ;: atid theri's others, I dare say, teat will back me up.&#xD;
"I believe in lettiti' everybody have their own way. I. don't, know who will&#xD;
be fool-hardy enough to meddle with the -yiing stranger:  He ' behaves well,&#xD;
and I can'tsee as it's anybody's business how long he stops here."&#xD;
" It's my liuslnds I The'fact is, he has been at Rathbun's."&#xD;
"Ah, yes ; I seewhere the shoe pinches.  He's seen the girl,.and there's&#xD;
jealousf in the camp. If the 'plain; awkward, inexperienned ;boy' should take&#xD;
a shine that ray, they'll be father pddr-chance for you, I allow, fog he'a much&#xD;
the best lookin', though I don't say it out of any ill will to you."&#xD;
Manuel Hart grew red with anget, but managed to choke down any vocal ex-&#xD;
ptessibn of hisresentient   N&#xD;
"'YTu have affirmed," resumed.oel " that .e can't usearifle,,now in&#xD;

as you or 1. I've watched him pretty closely, and concluded at last, that Mau-&#xD;
rice Harper is no fool."&#xD;
" It's hard tellin' what a man is now-a-days ; but its evident to me, that he's&#xD;
go etirely out 'of his reckonin', and has no more knowledge of the country he&#xD;
is in, than a child ten years old. I know fellers in these parts that can scare&#xD;
the hair off his head jest by two looks. What does he know about huntin', or&#xD;
the Regulators, or the moderators ; or, for that matter about this new trouble-&#xD;
that's brewin' tor us by the way of Santa Anna:?"&#xD;
"I presume be knows his own business, and that's enough," said Noel, drily&#xD;
"He'd better 'go! he'd better go ! or he'll find-".&#xD;
" Finid what?" .&#xD;
" Find himself regulated or moderated out of the world some fine mornir'."&#xD;
understandd you now, but let me tell you, that you'd better not attempt&#xD;
any game like that."&#xD;
"V ou'll stand up for him, I suppose?" exclaimed Hart,-with a sneer&#xD;
"I can't say what I'll do, Manuel Hart; but I'll take this opportunity to&#xD;
warn you to be careful."&#xD;
" Trust me, I'll be careful-I know how to be careful-I can work as silently&#xD;
as the spider, and I'llentrap the silly By as surely-yes--yes /:&#xD;
"I've said all I need say now; jest set the dug-out to the right shore, and I'll&#xD;
leave you'for the present, hopin' you'll be in-a better mood when we meet next."&#xD;
Manuel gave a few effectual strokes with the paddle, and the boat shot into&#xD;
the bank, when Noel Noon, taking his rifle and a small knapsack, stepped on&#xD;
shore.&#xD;
" Cultivate more Christian feelings, Manuel," added the hunter, as he adjust&#xD;
ed the knapsack upon his shoulders, and moved away.&#xD;
Hart made no reply, but propelled the dug-out once more into the stream:&#xD;
" He does very well for a hunter ; he can bring down a deer," muttered 'the&#xD;
backwoodsman, " but Noel Noon ain't the man for this country, exactly; he's&#xD;
too honest, and honesty is the death of a chap here. I can trust him with all&#xD;
I'm worth, and feel as safe as if it was in the Bank of"England ; but come to&#xD;
the case in hand, he ain't the man to play a despenate game where there's a itt-&#xD;
tie underhand shootin' or drinkin' to be done. That's his failin', and it's one I&#xD;
can't forgive. There's no great love atween- us now, and'it' won't be long, I&#xD;
take it, before there'll be absolute hatred, on'my part. I don't like the way he&#xD;
goes on about this strange, youngster that's driftin' about with his rifle and dog.&#xD;
I believe the loon is trying to please the Itathbun girls, notwithstanding his as-&#xD;
sertions to the 'contrary; Well 1'll watch e'm both, and if things don't go to&#xD;
my mind, they'll' be missed hereabout suddenly. NoelNoon don't know' Manuel&#xD;
Hart yet; he as no idea; of the power- which I wield, and perhaps he won't till&#xD;
he feels it."k&#xD;
Whiile the backwoodsman thus soliloqulsed, the dug-out was drifting slowly.&#xD;
down the river., A dozen seconds had elapsed, perhaps, after the last word had&#xD;
left his lips, *hen thesharp report of a rifle echoed through the woods, and a&#xD;

bullet struck the boat just forward of the thwart upon which he was sitting, and&#xD;
passing through the side, fell, spent and hurtless, into the water.&#xD;
Hart seized his rifle and cast a hurried glance at the shore whence the nex-&#xD;
pected messenger came. The first object that met his vision, was a young man&#xD;
ding a short distance from the river, 'quietly loading his rifle.&#xD;
The sight seemed to madden Manuel beyond endurance, and he instantly&#xD;
brought leis piece to his shoulder. ' But his hand shook with excitement, and&#xD;
his aim was unsteady. He was in the act of pressing the trigger, when the&#xD;
youag man became aware of his intention, and instantly stepped behind' a gi.&#xD;
gantic cypress. Perceiving that his design was frustrated, Hart lowered his&#xD;
rifle with a suppressed oath.&#xD;
" What is your purpose, sir f" asked the young man, stepping into open view&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"That's a more proper question for me to ask, I should judge !" retorted&#xD;
Hart, in a gruff tone.&#xD;
"Explain," added the young man.&#xD;
"The affair'don't need any great explanation ; here's the mark of your rifle.&#xD;
ball in my dug-out plain enough. What you aimed at, I'll leave other folks to&#xD;
judge ; -but it was evidently not this boat."&#xD;
"i was not aware that my shot struck your dug-out, certainly. I fired at a&#xD;
birdion the wing; more for the purpose of getting'rid of an old charge, than&#xD;
for anything else."&#xD;
" A very good story to tell off hand, I'll allow, stranger ; but it won't g&#xD;
down-it won't, by no means. Balls don't fly about in such a careless way,&#xD;
without being' sent,"'rejoined the forester, in the same unfriendly way.&#xD;
46I trust, sir, you do not mean to accuse me of an intention to do you mis-.&#xD;
chief?" said the young hunter, quietly.&#xD;
"It don't require much stretch of the imagination tounderstand what Imean.&#xD;
This is rather a serious matter, and it must be settled sooner or later."&#xD;
" It is not serious unless you chose to make it so. Your dug-out was struck&#xD;
by mere accident, and you cannot well be angry with me for so slight and unin-&#xD;
tentional a provocation."&#xD;
" Every assassin in Texas could make as good a plea eas that, if he should&#xD;
miss his aim, and hit a dug-out instead of a man. I want satisfaction I"&#xD;
" I perceive that you are resolved on a quarrel; but answer 'me one question.&#xD;
How happens it, that if I really had a design on your 'life, did not immiediate-&#xD;
ly discharge the other barrel, for my rifle is double? What an you, say to that?"'&#xD;
" That it's a shallow apology for a want of skill. Quite likely the other bar&#xD;
rel isn't loaded, or i-fused fire. Don't think I shall let du o'ffin this way. I&#xD;
care as little for a Northern six-footer as I do:foa Texan kangaroo. If you've&#xD;
got any courage or honor, you'll, promise to meet ,ne, aised and eq ped, a.&#xD;
-cording to the 'by-laws and regulations of this uncommon land of liberty."&#xD;
" Speak and tell me what satisfaction you require ?" said the young hunter.&#xD;

IRIS RATHBUN. JACK LAWLESS.&#xD;
Savi=a looked after the rough backwoodsan ashe fidted-oc- with sat e-&#xD;
pression half-serious, half-comic. The red spot that had appeared upon either'&#xD;
cheek a f seconds before, disappeared, and 10t4 his face of its wanted complex-&#xD;
ion, calm and undisturbed by passion. A ddg-of the largest size and of rare&#xD;
blood , laygerouchingquietly at his feet,-watthing his countenan e; apparently&#xD;
with' much interest.&#xD;
;Honest, you have 'a better nature than that man," said Harper, observing&#xD;
the earnest and trusting looks of the' animal.&#xD;
" Honest" responded tothe flattering remark by a-sigaiisant wavy modeofh&#xD;
of his tall.&#xD;
K I can trust you, ily dog; yonder biped I wonld not trust with a sieglefal-&#xD;
thing, if anything of importance'wasstaked on his faithfulness.&#xD;

ted that he was fullyf'of his masters opinion.&#xD;
WhIle Harper was interpreting the language of his hunible friend,. n-far&#xD;
was placed lightly upon .his shoulder. Turning with a start, he beheld- a tall&#xD;
and:dignified figure, *hows e untenauce and' costume -betrayed im of another&#xD;
type of men.&#xD;
"White, hunter must *atch-'his ears must be open-his 'eyed must not be&#xD;
shut. He must hear the leaves when theyrustle, and the winds must" bring to&#xD;
his nostrils the scent-ofhis enemies," said, the son Of the forest, With emphasis.&#xD;
" True, red man, very true. Should not -uffet myself to be thus surprised':&#xD;
'tita stain on my knowledge of woodcraft," replied Harper, coloring.&#xD;
"The bird of war hovers over the border.  The, Camanehes lie in wait fb&#xD;

14THE MAID -OF THE RANCH.&#xD;
" Yes, white man, I am the chief of the Lipans. We have dug up the hatch.&#xD;
et, to wipe out the wrongs which we have suffered at the hands of the Caman-&#xD;
ches."&#xD;
The Camanches outnumber you, and war must eventually end in disaster to&#xD;
you and your people.".&#xD;
"Let it be so, if the Great Spirit wills. It is the red-skin's nature to resent&#xD;
and revenge injuries, and he cannot learn to do otherwise. Every drop of blood&#xD;
in our veins tells as to fight when we are wronged. If it pleases the Master of&#xD;
Life, we will die as we have lived-with weapons of war in our hands. The&#xD;
happy hunting grounds are ever open to all tru souls."  4.&#xD;
Harper made ne answer, for he knew that the voice of nature was stronger&#xD;
with the red man, than the voice of argument uttered by human lips.&#xD;
"My brother is fall if thought-; he has met the big moccasin snke," added&#xD;
Warpath, at length.&#xD;
" You mean thei'man that has just floated down the river in the boat 2" said&#xD;
Maurice, turning to Warpath, inquiringly.&#xD;
"He is a-serpent that crouches in the breaks and in the reeds, and stings,&#xD;
aid then runs into his hole where he cannot be found. Hunter, walk carefully&#xD;
when you move through the tangled grass, and always be:ready to spring aside,&#xD;
that the deadly reptile may be foiled," continued the Lipan, earnestly. -&#xD;
"I will treasure up the wisdom of Warpath, and it shall not be lost."-&#xD;
"To-day I saw the trapper-he will kindle his fire to-night at the .foot of a&#xD;
liii yonder is the direction of the, setting sun; white brother, you'll find him&#xD;
there. He can speak to you of this fine moccasin snake, and' his words will be&#xD;
wise. He has a white skin but his heart is red. His aim is sure; the voice of&#xD;
his war-cry is the shout of death. He can learn my white friend much. He can&#xD;
show him how to read the signs of an enemy, and how to follow a trail through&#xD;
a chapparal, the swamp of cane, and the tangled thicket."&#xD;
Warpath waved his hand, tightened his belt, and walked hastily into the dark&#xD;
. forest.&#xD;
Harper stood in deep thought, then shouldered his rifle, and followed by Hon-&#xD;
est, pursued his way along the bank of the Brazos, For ,an hour or more he&#xD;
moved on without stopping ; but not without the obser vance ot caution. Sud-&#xD;
denly the dog paused' and indicated by actions that an object attracted hisatten-&#xD;
tion. He did not. appear alarmed orexcited, but gazed steadily towards a small&#xD;
thicketrof post oak that grew down to the river's bank..&#xD;
"It canbe nothing very dangerous, or Honest would.not remain so passive,"&#xD;
thoughtthe hunter, bringing his rifle into a position to use it if necessary. He&#xD;
advanced noiselessly towards the thicket, and separating the branches of the&#xD;
trees, looked in among the dense umbrage. He saw neither deer, panther nor&#xD;
Camancbe ;- but a female of some seventeen or eighteen summers, seated upon a&#xD;
mossy knoll. - Her right arm rested upon the verdant eminence which arose in-&#xD;
a gentle swell beside her,; and her finely forced. head was supported by the&#xD;
corresponding hand. The whole attitude',wasthoughtful and graceful. In tha&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MAID OF THE RANCHE.                      l0&#xD;
left hand she held an open book ; but it was evident that the was not reading :&#xD;
her full, pensive eyes were fixed dreamily upon vacancy. Her. dark and redun-&#xD;
dant hair fell with native freedom over her white neck, and curled with be-&#xD;
witching grace. Her features were somewhat oval in outline and studiously&#xD;
regular.&#xD;
Maurice Harper gazed at this singular aggregation of female charms with an&#xD;
admiration so genuine, that no interpreterwas required to explain his emotions&#xD;
to a third person. He placed the breech of his rifle softly,upon the ground,and&#xD;
made a motion to Honest to the purpose that he should lie down and keep still ;&#xD;
and he was too sensible and honorable a dog to demur at so reasonable a de.&#xD;
mane upon his obedience. He stretched himself upon the ground wondering,&#xD;
doubtless, what kind'Qf game his master had started now, and querying whether&#xD;
he was not losing his precious ttkne with no prospect in view of trying his skit'&#xD;
as a hunter.&#xD;
Harper knew the young lady who had chained his attention and dazzled his&#xD;
eyes with her beauty. He had seen Iris Rathburn at the" Rathburn' Ranche"&#xD;
(as it was called), a few days before. On that occasion, however, he had obtain-&#xD;
ed but a passing glimpse of her person, and only a momentary view of her fea-&#xD;
tures, afforded him by her while casually passing through the corral, where he&#xD;
was conversing with her father. He made the discovery that her face and figure&#xD;
were uncommonly attractive ; and felt a strong and almost irresistible desireoto&#xD;
see her -again, and with that object in view, had visited the ranche several times&#xD;
afterward, but without success.&#xD;
Her sister Ramona, he had met and conversed with : and though not wait-&#xD;
ing in beauty, she had failed to make that impression upon him which the mo-&#xD;
mentary appearance of Iris;had done.,&#xD;
He was much gratified that chance had finally given him an opportunity to&#xD;
see the maiden who had so strangely excited his curiosity. When the first sur-&#xD;
prise bad passed, he began to have some misgivings in relation to the propriety&#xD;
of intruding upon her moments of retirement, and taking advantage of his pres-&#xD;
eat concealment to watch the play of her features, and, read, as. it were, upon&#xD;
her ingenuous face the pages of thought passing within. It appeared to him&#xD;
likea breach of etiquette, although his approach to that position had been to&#xD;
tally accidental. Harper gazed a second more at the sylvan beauty, and then&#xD;
with reluctant steps glided away.&#xD;
He did not go far, however, but threw his manly figureupon a grassy hillock&#xD;
near the river, and tried to employ his mind bywatching the movements of a&#xD;
young alligator that was rolling lazily about in the water. Honest took his&#xD;
post beside his master with characteristic :quietness and docility. The young&#xD;
man looked at the amphibious and awkward monster until it became monoton-&#xD;
ous, for his thoughts were really in the oaken growth just above him. He was&#xD;
on'the point of rising to leave the spot when a sharp cry, as of fear, reached his&#xD;
ears. Snatching his rifle instantly from the ground, he ran towards the thicket.&#xD;
Honest was equally active, and bounded with a threatening growl in the same'&#xD;

&#xD;
"Let go-- dat will do," added- Harper, who, glancing at the fello's fes,&#xD;
perceived that'i t }ag going hard 'th him.&#xD;
The faithful creature was not quite pleased at'this command, and by a wish&#xD;
ful look seemed to ask permission to continue his efforts,; but he reluctantly.&#xD;
relinquished his hold, and the outlaw inhaled a long breath, and made 'a disa-&#xD;
greeable rattling in his throat.&#xD;
"Will he die?"asked Iris, withia shi'fer of horror.&#xD;
"Trust me, he will not-; bad men do-t die so easily ; they cling to life to&#xD;
the last,for they fear the futureand Would live on any conditions, however mis-&#xD;
erable. He's only somewhat cramped for want of breath, and slightly wounded&#xD;
about the neck. lie will soon 'be upon his feet again."&#xD;
Harper was right ; the injury which the man had received was not serious.&#xD;
In a short time his respiration became regular, and he appeared entirely con-&#xD;
scious-of his position.&#xD;
" Come, sir, get up and stake the trail," said Maurice. " Your presence is&#xD;
not wanted, as you must now realize. Don't let him attempt mischief, Honest."&#xD;
The "Texan cub," now pretty well tamed; slowly assumed the position natu-&#xD;
ral to human bipeds, while the dog, by sundry low growls advised 'him that he&#xD;
was watching him closely, and should punish any rebellious acts on the spot.&#xD;
"You can fight with your imp of a dog, but you can't fight like a mnan i"&#xD;
He exclaimed, while his shaggy chin quivered with passion. ~"+This wont be&#xD;
the end of it I the end will be a different thing altogether.  I shall fix you, I&#xD;
wont sleep sound till I Aix you," he continued, speaking with extreme difficulty,&#xD;
and'pressing' his band to hislacerated throat, still smarting with pain.&#xD;
" How frightful !" cried Iris, turning from the scene with a feeling of faint-&#xD;
ness.'&#xD;
"You shall hear of somethin' more frightful than this bit of a skrimmage, or&#xD;
my name aint Jack Lawless, young woman. You've had a hand in this busi-&#xD;
ness, and ' sha'nt forgit ye. We shall meet one of these days, -when the power&#xD;
will be on my side, and I'll use it. I'm a Texan cub I"&#xD;
Without making any rejoinder, Harper and Miss Rathbun walked from the&#xD;
spot towards the Ranche, leaving Lawless pouring forth the most bitter'invec-&#xD;
tives and direst threats of vengeance.&#xD;
But few words were spoken'by the parties as they moved away. Occasion-&#xD;
ally, Maurice east a furtive glancee at his fair conipanion, but could at that mo-&#xD;
ment thipk of no fitting words to address to her. He walked by her side until&#xD;
they reached the corral.&#xD;
"Here you are safe!' hesaid, pausing&#xD;
" Will you enter and receive the thanks ofiny friends for your disinterested&#xD;
and timely ervices?" returned Iris.&#xD;
"I requireanddesir no thanks. The reflection that I have perhaps saved&#xD;
you from something very unpleasant, is all the reward I deserve or aspire to,"&#xD;
he replied, respectfully.&#xD;
"It would certainly give me pleasure to have you enter and partake or our&#xD;

hospit.aity ; but like all hunters and foresters, I suppose you are extremely&#xD;
wayward, and will do as you please. If you will not accept my invitation for&#xD;
this occasion, accept it as extending to an indefinite period, and consult your&#xD;
own convenience, added Iris, gracefully.&#xD;
",Be assured, Miss Rathbun, that your kindness shall not be forgotten., I&#xD;
will avail myself of your generous invitation, as soon, as circumstances will pas.&#xD;
sibly permit; until that time, allow me to say adios amigo."&#xD;
"Adios," said the maiden, in a sweet voice. So the youth and Iris parted.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE COMPACT. MELTIAH Moss.&#xD;
AFrE leaving Rathburn Ranche Maurice Harper turned his face in the dire..&#xD;
tion of the setting sun, in order to join his old friend, Baptiste Lorrimer, At the&#xD;
spot indicated by the Lipan. He made determined efforts to think of every-&#xD;
thing but Iris, but instead of succeeding, could not, for five consecutive sia-&#xD;
utes, fasten his mind upon any other object.&#xD;
Ourhero was one of those persons who fancy that they can come in contact&#xD;
. 'ith the loveliest portion of creation, withoutexperiencing any deeper emotion&#xD;
than common friendship. He imagined, in ahort, that he could control the cur-&#xD;
rent of his affections, and place them where he saw fit. But when he had ar-&#xD;
gued himself into this belief, he had not'seen Miss Rathburn, and consequently&#xD;
had no means of judging of the effects of beauty like hers. He mentally cor-,&#xD;
fessed that she was very agreeable, and concluded that he should call at the Ran-&#xD;
che and see her again when it was quite convenient.&#xD;
The report of a rifle caused him to pause. Looking rapidly around him, he&#xD;
perceived a man leisurely advancing. He was young, well-formed, and clad in&#xD;
hunting guise.&#xD;
"I fired at a deer, but the distance was long, and I believeI missed my mark,'&#xD;
he said, observing our hero.&#xD;
"One cannot always be successful' replied Harper.&#xD;
" It cannot be expected when one fires so far ; but I seldoni throw away a&#xD;
shot. You must understand, stranger, that my nerves are steady, and my eyes&#xD;
are used to lookin' through the sights," added the'other.&#xD;
" You have been long-used to the woods, I suspect?"&#xD;
"Tou hmay well say that ; for I took naterally to the timber when I was a&#xD;
mere lad, no higher than my ramrod; and I've been in itbf and on ever since.&#xD;
I take it you are fresh in these parts ?"&#xD;
" I have not been in this particular locality long, I'll allow," returned Maur-&#xD;
ice, who began to-be already interested in his new acquaintance.&#xD;
"It's rather a lawless place, take it altogether, and it's sometime before stran-&#xD;
gers can get the hang of the country."&#xD;

stately form of the chief pf the Lipans approached.&#xD;
" Union makes streng-gives one arm the-power of two. The bird of- war is&#xD;
screaming on the border. There ie danger in the cane-swamp, and in the cy-&#xD;

"Is there:any new feud,?" inquiredHarper.&#xD;
"' ie means that there are dangers en the border and within the border-&#xD;
from civil feuds, and from, foreign invasion," said Noel.&#xD;
j'The unsettled.state  the country generally, is as serious;in its- aspects as it&#xD;
can ,ewl be, if I rightly comprehend;the matter. Every man' here appeals' to&#xD;

prgbably.not ended yet,",continued Maurice.'&#xD;
"dhe Moccasin Snake will not forget,' said Wsrpath.      -&#xD;
" That's Manuel Hart, you mean, I take it, Warpath?" replied Noel..&#xD;
" Wa, waI it-is him," replied the Limian.&#xD;
Harper hereupon gave a simple statementof what, had occurred in relation to&#xD;
Manuel1Hart ; after:wrich, he narrated the incident which had transpired ,in&#xD;
the forest oft oak, wherein Iris Rathbnn had been concerned.&#xD;
Noel listened with }respectful attention, occasionally shaking his 'head and&#xD;
looking serious,&#xD;
Warpath stood motionless as a cypress at his side apparently absorbed in his&#xD;
rejections on some topic more interesting.Â°&#xD;
"I'm sorry for yo, that these things have happened, for you have, made two&#xD;
dangerous enemies, who will be content with nothing short of, your blood. I&#xD;
know Manuel jart. We, never got along very well together, though we've&#xD;
had io open quarrel. He'is too much of a coward to quarrel above-board ; he&#xD;
prefersto work in an underhand way, andstrike like a serpent when you don't&#xD;

than H art. He has some courage, while the other aint got an atom. Between&#xD;

Noel Noon kept his eyesfastened on ur hero's, face as he spoke, aluiough&#xD;
without 'the appearance of watching him:&#xD;
"IDoes the coward presume-"&#xD;
Maurice suddenly checked himself, and Anished the sentience;in ..more calm&#xD;
and commonplace tone, while Noon and Warpath exchanged sigqificant looks.&#xD;
"~Does the coward presume to think of one so far his superior ?"&#xD;
"I may safely say that he does."&#xD;
"And, is Miss Rathbun aware of it, do ye imagine ?"&#xD;
"Well;if I was to tell my thoughts and suspicions, I should reply in the af-&#xD;
firmative."&#xD;
"Does she encourage him ?".demanded Harper, in a hurried tone, intended to&#xD;
be very indifferent and ordinary.&#xD;
"I should do wrong to throw out any hints to that effect.. There's something'&#xD;
atween Hart and the girl's father that I can't fathom, and which, I fancy gives&#xD;
her some uneasiness ; but what the natur of it is, I: have no means of knowin."&#xD;
" Perhaps she feaE5 this boorish and heartless woodsmen ~"&#xD;
"It wouldn't be strange. I shan't on no account say anything' ginthat view&#xD;
of the case. If-there is some kind of a mystery yhich giyes Eart power over&#xD;
Rathbun, I've.only to remark that I wouldn't be in his place for any consider-&#xD;
ation- In my; weak comprehension, there's something' naterally sbopkin' in bei'&#xD;
governed by an unprincipled critter like him, without the means.of 'helpin' one's,&#xD;
self ;'and it would place Iris in an onhappy position."&#xD;
" I trust that you would not scruple to assist her, or her sister, if you discov-&#xD;
ered that they were being wronged or rendered wretched ?". dded Harper, earn-&#xD;
estly.&#xD;
"-If it should ever come to pass that the efforts 4frough, NoelNoon can&#xD;

T11 1HAID OF THE RANCHE-&#xD;
- n ESAYED.&#xD;
THE person addressed favored Maurice with another. searching glance, and&#xD;
then shouldering his rifle,:took northeasterly.course, and put his moecagoned&#xD;
feet in motion. +Por some:momentsathe parties;walked on in silence, harperr&#xD;
keeping a sharpblok.out in every direction, and Honest, treading. close at his&#xD;
heels, with his glowing eyeballs fastened upon the stranger, occasionally placing.&#xD;
his nose to the ground, and then raising his bead, snuffing theair as if to take&#xD;
any strange scent that thergentle winds might ,happen to bring,&#xD;
The sun andlower-and:loweriand finally-went down,l4ea4ing, a sky without&#xD;
a staror a moon.&#xD;
The darkness drew deeper, and Meltigh  oss walked with ;less,assured steps.&#xD;
.I reckon-I've got a, trifle bewildered," he:said, pausing and.casting anxious&#xD;
glancesq around him,             f&#xD;
You have been diverging from the.,Qurse which you q4 first indicated as&#xD;
the truerone, for half;anhour," replied Harper&#xD;
" I allow that it isn't easy to navigate these parts .when it's so oncommon&#xD;
dark, butit's very seldom that I lose the pints o' compass.'&#xD;
' The moonwill be up soon, andperhaps we had better -renain where we are&#xD;
until it appears."&#xD;
"I wasjest turning' that subject over in my ming,stranger, for it seems like&#xD;
workin' agin' natur tryin' to get through this chapparal while the  igt is so&#xD;
black and; heavy."&#xD;
I shall endeavor to get a little sleep," said. Harper.,&#xD;
'"What, sleepthere, among the reptiles, copperheads, and other poisonous var-&#xD;
mints! You must be sum'at wild i your notions, I take it."&#xD;
Harper stretched his athletic person at;the foot of a cypress, called.Jonest,&#xD;
bade hinm lie down, and then-placed hie head upon the dog's shaggy shopl4ers.&#xD;
.4Perhaps that curus critter'll keepoff the noxious perductions of this site ?"&#xD;
remarked,.Meltiah, looking fixedly at the dog, whose eyes were glowing brightly&#xD;
through the darkness.&#xD;
It's very possible," returned Maurice, quietly.&#xD;
"Smart ookin'-rifle, that of yours 1 Must be, rather heavy, I reckon." While&#xD;
Moss was speaking, he stretched out his hand carelessly, and took Harper's rifle&#xD;
'which be bad set against a tree-near him. .A deep, angry growl admonished the&#xD;
backwoodsman that his movements were watched.&#xD;
"What's his name?" he asked.&#xD;
Honest?'&#xD;
"Will the varmint bite ?"&#xD;
"It wouldn't be strange."&#xD;
Meltiah scowled, and evidently wanted'to send a ball through the mastiff's&#xD;
head, but determined on a pacific ograe, at least for the present.&#xD;
"Honest-HonestI good feller 1" he said, in a tone intended to be vastly&#xD;
conciliating.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
A more savage growl warned hin to relinquish his hed. upon the gun alto-&#xD;
gether, which he was prudent enough to: do. Hey* retreated a few paces, and&#xD;
seated himself sullenly upon the trunk of a-tree which the winds had overturn-&#xD;
ed. Resting his chin upon the palm of his right hand, and his elbow upon his&#xD;
knee, while his rifle, with the breech upon' the. ground, was; supported by his&#xD;
left arm, he gazed intently,-through the-gloom at the dimoutlines of Iarper and&#xD;
his dog. . This position he maintainedfor some minutest and changesl it only to&#xD;
cast uneasy glances about him, or to play with his rifle impatiently.&#xD;

Half an hour elapsed, which evidently seemed a long time, t our hero'sauew&#xD;
acquaintance.' At the expirationof that period, the latteerose, produced ma-&#xD;
terials, ignited a flame, and applied it to the bark of a dried cedar.:,.&#xD;
Instantly it was a-blaze, and the fire rant crackling and leaping, in glowing&#xD;
wreaths to the top. - This act confirmed-thesuspicions of 11arper,:and he began&#xD;
to experience a feeling of insecurity quite unconmnop to him..&#xD;
"It seems to me somewhat imprudent to light such.a beacon as that," he said,&#xD;
with some asperity of tone.&#xD;
"For what reason ?&#xD;
"It might attract a war party of Camanches upon us,"&#xD;
,Let 'em come, stranger. I'm never safeard of dying afore my time comes&#xD;
though I've seen some folks as is, and can't never make themselves happy under&#xD;
no conditions, whatsomever."&#xD;
"Words are very cheap, my fine fellow, but they do not go far with me. I&#xD;
have always observed that those who talk the most bravely in moments of secu-&#xD;
rity, display the least courage in time of danger."&#xD;

"What's that ?" inquired Maurice.&#xD;
" It's- what you can't know till you experience it. Fifty galvanic batteries,&#xD;
allilet loose on you at once, wouldn't be nothin' to it."&#xD;
"It must be dreadful 1" said Harper, quietly.&#xD;
I'll allow that it is," pursued Mltiah, impressively.&#xD;
"You've no fear of anything of that sort, yourself, I suppose?" added the&#xD;
young man, in the same tone.&#xD;
" Nohtn-the least; because 'you see I'm posted up :ia these things, and as&#xD;
oncommon hard to beat."&#xD;
" It will be well for you to bear in mind, sir, that if you attempt toplay off&#xD;

continued Matrice, more ippressively.&#xD;
" Now dont talk in that way I You make a fellow feel oncomfortable. The&#xD;

"You'were to be well paid, I suppose ?"&#xD;
"Nothing to brag on, for thatmatter.' Manuel aint over and above liberal&#xD;
-'tian't in him to be. If I'dknown fully the natur of this anermal, I shouldn't&#xD;

"The excuses of bad men when detected ins crime, usually come with an ill&#xD;
grace. You cannot well extenuate your fault. Had you borne the reputation&#xD;
of au honest man, Hart would not have attempted to draw youinto his nefari-&#xD;

" That's ryther 'philersophical, I take it.'&#xD;
" So, that was a fabrication about Lorrimer's: being on the spot you indica-&#xD;

"I should say it was, 'cordin' to my weak comprehension."&#xD;
"Here's your rifle, Meltiah, Ihopg you'll live to be a better man. If you&#xD;
wish, you can accompany me to old Lorrimer's camp."&#xD;
"I knew you wasn't so bad as you pertended," said the backwoodsman, evi-&#xD;
dently much relieved. "Seein' you're so kind and obligin' as to ask me, I'll go&#xD;
with you,"&#xD;
Maurice now changed his course and walked rapidly towards tie spot where&#xD;
he had good reason to suppose that Lorrimer was expecting him, followed by&#xD;
Meltiah'and Honest.&#xD;
Whether our hero felt perfectly secure with this singular being close at his&#xD;

his head with an expression of considerable surprise,.upon hearing the sharp&#xD;
snap of Meltiah's rifle Soquickly didMaurice turn towards the woodsman, that his&#xD;
piece was still levelledat him, and his finger pn the trigger. For an instant the&#xD;
young 'man's eyes flashed with anger, but the excitement passed as rapidly as&#xD;
it came..&#xD;
"Itook the precaution to take the cap from your rife, andtput a damaged one&#xD;

"I'm afeared you'll let me have the contents of the double-barrels when 1&#xD;

" I give you my word that I will not ; so go ahead," returned Maurice.&#xD;
The proposed change was quickly made, and the parties pursued their lonely&#xD;
way-towards the camp of Bapite Lorrimer.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
AN INTERVIEW&#xD;
A FEW days subsequent to the scenes narrated in the foregoing chapter, Iris&#xD;
Rathburn, while walking a short distance from the Ranche, was unexpectedly ac-&#xD;
costed by Manuel Hart. The circumstance of 'meeting him alone was not at&#xD;
all agreeable to her feelings, for reasons which may perhaps appear as we pro-&#xD;
ceed. With all his roughness of manner, the hunter was shrewd, calculating&#xD;
and persevering ; qualities highly dangerous when characterizing a bad man.&#xD;
Having, as the reader is aware, a given purpose in view, ;so far as our her-&#xD;
oinewas concerned, he commenced operations with considerable skill, disguising&#xD;
as well as he could his real object. At first his remarks were of a general and&#xD;
commonplace kind, and made with more than usual courtesy ; for even Manuel,&#xD;
as clownish as he was, felt a rational desire to please such a maiden as Iris, so&#xD;
far as it could be done in the way of mere words.&#xD;
Butthe backwoodsman'was not, unfortunately for him, highly gifted in the&#xD;
divine art of expression any more than he was in the graces of deportment. Af-&#xD;
ter alluding to several things'in which he felt no real interest, he approached&#xD;
the subject uppermost in his thoughts, as follows:&#xD;
"I've heered that you got quite a fright tother day, all on account of that&#xD;
wild-lookin' chap as is coastin' hereabouts."&#xD;
" I was somewhat startled by the rudeness of a stranger, I confess," replied&#xD;
Miss Rathburn.&#xD;
"I don't know the partickerlers of.the case, miss ; how was it ?"&#xD;
"Simply this ; while enjoying the luxury of solitude in yonder growth of&#xD;
wood, I was terrified very much by the rude 'conduct of a wild-looking man&#xD;
who unexpectedly intruded upon my retreat."&#xD;
" How'did you get away from his imperdence?" asked Manuel, giving his&#xD;
fair acquaintance a searching look,&#xD;
in making:the statement as above, Miss Rathburn had not been wholly free&#xD;
froi embarrassment, for she intuitively guessed Hart's object in drawing, from&#xD;
her the details of her adventure; and wlfen 3b proposed the last query, she&#xD;
could not refrain from  manifesting more: marked evidences of confusion. Shp&#xD;
did what ladies are apt to do when obliged to speak of certain persons.-blnshe?&#xD;
...atthe sainetiume trying to display the utmost nonchalance and indifference.&#xD;

with anotheierching glance&#xD;

"ii you wouldn't be put  oft, IDd like to ask  ,name ? "&#xD;
"It was-I think it was Harper, or some thg like that," returned th eal&#xD;

estimation the merest trifle.&#xD;

likely to go back, usleqs he's carried."&#xD;
"You must be deceived respecting the young man!I" cried, Iris, earnestly.&#xD;
"You have confouided him with some other pron"&#xD;
"I wish I might obnfoad-him with sdme other person I" retorted Hart, ra-&#xD;

Asshe approached the Ranche, she sawN Noel Noon near the corral, convers-&#xD;
ing with Ramona. She slowly advanced and joined them, which, circumstance&#xD;
appeared to be a great relief to the hunter, who was evidently much pressed to&#xD;
find imitable subjects of remark.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you, Mr. Noon. What have you to communicate that is&#xD;
new ?" she asked, familiarly.&#xD;
" Nothin' very cheering , Miss Rathburn.. There's trouble all around us, at&#xD;
present.; General Cos continues to advance, and the Regulators and Modera-&#xD;
tors are fightin' among themselues in a way it isn't pleasant to think of."&#xD;
"What do you contemplate doing?"&#xD;
"A few of us hunters and woodsmen have concluded to meet the enemy, and&#xD;
let 'em-know what kind of stuff we're made of. You see, Miss.Rathburn, there's&#xD;
fighting to be done, and I must do my part on't.  This country belongs to us,&#xD;
I-take it, and it's our duty to defend it. Santa Anna's- roused,-and means mis-&#xD;
chief, you may depend. Baptiste Lorrimer, young Harper, Warpath, the chief,&#xD;
of the Lipans, and others, are of my opinion, and are ready to arm and nreet&#xD;
the MIexican wolves. We shall get the best and strongest horses the country&#xD;
can afford, and when once on the trail of the uncultivated, copper-faced var-&#xD;
mints, the words ' right about face' wont seldom be heered."&#xD;
"You are very much in earnest, friend Noon. Such a band of men as you&#xD;
propose organizing, ought certainly to have a distinctive name."&#xD;
"So they had ; and you and Ramona must give us one. Don't take it amiss&#xD;
gals, nor colorup so like the mischief in consequence, but vive our company a&#xD;
proper name. And I have a presentiment that if lips like yourn-beggin' your&#xD;
pardon allers-give us.a name, it will be a sort of charm er talisman, as some&#xD;
folks say, to protect us in the hour of danger."&#xD;
"A high and real compliment, Noel Noon, and we were ungrateful did we&#xD;
undervalue it. Come,Ramona, assist me with your ready wit to find a fitting&#xD;
appellation'for this chivalrous band of heroes.",&#xD;
"I am not quick at originating, or very ingenious; but I'll make an attempt.&#xD;
How would it do to call your company by the plain name of ' The Hunters of&#xD;
the Border?'"&#xD;
"That's verygood," said Noel; "I like it."      -&#xD;
"So do I, Mr. Noel," added Iris, "and so success to ' The Hunters of the&#xD;
Border,'who, mounted upon fleet and hardy horses, will dpsh upon :the enemy,&#xD;
and scatter his forces to the winds in a moment of time, after the style of Fran-&#xD;
cis Marion, one of the heroes of the southern campaign."    .&#xD;
"Hurra, for' The }Hunters of the, Border 1'" shouted Noon,-enthusiastically.&#xD;
" fow do you progress in raising recruits of the right stamp ?" inquired Iris.&#xD;

" Manuel Hart counts another in your ranks ?" pursued our heroine.&#xD;
"I'm sorry to sa that he doesn't, seeing' he's -a particular friend of yours,&#xD;
Miss Iris ?"said Noel, gravely.&#xD;
"What are his reasons for declining to join you?"&#xD;
"I think because he's afeared of close-questions, and had rayther stay where&#xD;
he wont get no hard knocks. I hope there's no offence in sayin' so ?"&#xD;
" None to me, at least, Noel. Another question I wish to ask. - Have you&#xD;
e'er heard any accounts prejudicial to the character of Mr. Harper ?"&#xD;
I've heered things within a day or two which wouldn't be to his credit, If&#xD;
true, but not from a source I can rely on'for honesty. And I want itto be un-&#xD;
derstood, once for all, that any person as tries to injure Maurice Harper, by cir-&#xD;
culatin'.bad reports, has gotto deal with me for the same."&#xD;
Noel gave considerable emphasis to his words, for he meant that it :shouldbe&#xD;
felt that he was in earnest.&#xD;
" That's a very good principle to act upon, and I'm glad to'hear you speak so&#xD;
frankly on the subject," replied Iris, with warmth.&#xD;
" I didn't know as it would be pleasin' to you, seem' Manuel Hart is here-&#xD;
abouts so much ; but I'd advise you not to heed all that you hear, no matter&#xD;
where it comes from.&#xD;
. he moment Noel Noon ceased speaking, the rapid discharge of fire-arms&#xD;
as heard in the direction of the river, mingled with loud shouts and discordant&#xD;
yells. Both the maidens grew pale and looked anxiously at Noel for explana-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
, I suspect," said he, examining his;rifle, "that the two great'curses of the&#xD;
country-the Regulators and the Moderators-have met and are killing' each&#xD;
other like unnatural savages. 1Il go down the river a little way and see what&#xD;
the trouble is."&#xD;
"oStay, Noel-it won't be safe 1" cried Ramona.&#xD;
As Noel was turning front the maidens to put his purpose in operation, Mel-&#xD;
tiah Moss made his appearance, running with all his strength towards the-scene&#xD;
of tumult.&#xD;
" Thar's a fight somewhar, an' I'm bonn4 to go- in for it ! Hurra for Davie&#xD;
Crockett and the gouging system !" shouted Nleltiah, as he passed the parties.&#xD;
Just behind Moss came another personage whom Iris recognized as Jack'&#xD;
Lawless. He brandished aloft a bowie-knife, and a double-barrel,and apppared&#xD;
half frantic with delight :at the near prospect of a conflict. Hollowing and&#xD;
screaming wildly, he disappeared in the thicket, and his shrill voice was heard a&#xD;
moment after in the small plateau beyond,&#xD;

THE   AID OF THE RANCHE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The reader may possibly imagine that feats of'this kind cannot well' be done&#xD;
by the sharpest shooters that the country can producer; but - itsis .a fact that&#xD;
much more skillful shooting than this has been accomplished by practeed ripe-&#xD;
men with American rifles, on various occasions.  Western ;and Southern hunt.&#xD;
era take muchpride and experience much satisfaction in deeds of this bold and&#xD;
daring nature.&#xD;
-Our hero was not unslsilled  inthe use of the rifle.~ He had been familiar with&#xD;
it from childhood; and therefore when he levelled the sights upon Meltiah's&#xD;
cap, he felt'no fear that he should miss his mark and injure the woodsman.. He&#xD;
fred -and the repoit'was'instantly followed by that of Noon's rifle. Both Moss&#xD;
acd Lawless stood irresoute atd silent ; then'the former pulled off his cap and&#xD;
the latter felt his beard--.tle shots had proved true to. their aim.&#xD;
Manuel Hart had already thrown himself upon the ground close to the roots of&#xD;
the cypress, and now his comrades in sin followed his lead with unexampled eel-&#xD;
erity, crouching so low that their bodies :were copcealed by the surrounding&#xD;
brakes-.&#xD;
S"You see what sneaking' villany is,"said Lorrimer. " It's afeared of every.&#xD;
thin', and yet cruel and revengeful, and can't never, under no carcumstances, be&#xD;
trusted. liow all these men ought to'be fighting the commonenemy of Texsa,&#xD;
instead of killin' each other.. 'Isn't it a pity they won't unite to fight the Mexi.&#xD;
cans ?""&#xD;
"It is indeed; but see, the Moderators areprevailing. They are pressing up.&#xD;
ontheir foes, hoping to drive them into the river., If there were no braver men&#xD;
among them than those ere fellers yonder in the, brakes, the fight would soonh&#xD;
end."&#xD;
While the parties were mutually hoping that something wpuld transpire to&#xD;
end this combat, the Iegulators recovered their lost ground and. pressed hard&#xD;
upon their oppone ts, unexpectedly bringing our friends within the range of&#xD;
both fires.&#xD;
The.leader of the faction now in the ascendant-.-a tall, ferocious-looking man&#xD;
with a broad chest, and great power of-lungs,' seeing Maurice and his comrades,&#xD;
hailed them, desiring to know whether they were friends or enemies.&#xD;
d Neither," replied Maurice ; "we are' neutral."r&#xD;
"That means neither.on-one side or t'other, I take it," returned the captain,&#xD;
for he was= thus distinguished.&#xD;
"That's the signification of it, precisely, and I want you to hold on, a little,&#xD;
and listen to reason," replied Lorrimer.&#xD;
"Season aia't what we want, old 'feller, so stand out of the way, or I allow&#xD;
we shall pepper you!. People as can't fight aint good for much, no way. Come&#xD;
on,: oye I Hurra:l At 'eti agin-drive 'em into the river 1" shouted the leader.&#xD;
The combat was being renewed with fresh' malignity, when Warpath sud-&#xD;
denly ran in between the contending parties; crying&#xD;
" A war party of the Camanches are coming, white men-! Ceaseto kill each&#xD;
other, and turn your arms against the old enemies of your race I"&#xD;
&#xD;
.&#xD;
39&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MAID OF THE ERANCEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"What's that you're sayin'?" cried the captain of 'the Moderators.&#xD;
" The Camanches are close at haudand their numbers are many., They will&#xD;
eat you down like grass. They are coming like the winds-there is no Lm to&#xD;
be lost-who among you will fight ?"&#xD;
"'Are there any Mexicans with:them?'# asked:Lorrimer.&#xD;
"White men, yes; there are many Mexidds with them, and the thunder as&#xD;
their horses and mustangs will Soon be heard.  Make ready your weapons-&#xD;
sound the war cry--victory, or the happy hunting grounds I"&#xD;
Harper instantly leaped upon a rock, and swinging his cp, took up the cry&#xD;
and shouted at the top of his voice,: " victory, or the happy hunting grounds."&#xD;
Lorrimer and Noel' echoed this sentiment; and 'many of the Moderators and&#xD;
Regulatorscaught it up and re-echbed it earnestly; while others sullenly gazing&#xD;
at each other, panting with exertion.'' '&#xD;
"You have heard what oUr fied brother has said," continued Maurice.; "Be.&#xD;
men, and let'this unnatural conflict ' stop where it is, thatl.you may turn you&#xD;
arms against real foes. Mexico is sending=forth her legioens-they cone,-they&#xD;
incite the restless Camanches against you. Your wives and children: will be&#xD;
slain, and your homes leftdesolate. Arouse! 'awake ! no longer 'be' blindedby&#xD;
partisan feelings. Form into order of battle, andawait firinly the approach of&#xD;
the enemy."&#xD;
While ilarper was speaking, a rifle ball passed through his, coat sleeve, ant&#xD;
anothergrazed his left cheek., When he ceased, some 'cheered' him, others-re-.&#xD;
mained silent and moody, either indifferent to what might come, or still' too full&#xD;
of rancor'and liate'to care for foes otherthan those before them.&#xD;
"I'll go after such of our men as I can find," said Noel Noon, "and bring,'M&#xD;
to the rescue."&#xD;
"Too late! to6late !' cried' Warpath. " In a moment you will hear the te&#xD;
rile war-ery of 'the'Camnandhes, and the carbines of'ibe Mexicans."&#xD;
A great' cah limad fallen on the disturbed human elements, and leaning on&#xD;
their arms, the combatants*awaited they knew notwhat. Nature also was calm.&#xD;
Not a breeze stirred the leaves; or ruffled the waters. The wounded, apparently,&#xD;
suppressed.their groans with a strong effort. The smoke had.lifted, leaving the&#xD;
quiet air impregnated with aulphurous still.&#xD;
Suddenly the stillness 'sw broken by an awful din. Unseen enemies -shonted&#xD;
their battle-dies, andasafrtling volley poured like a storm upon those who were&#xD;
. busily erigayirdestroying each other a few seconds before. Harper saw two&#xD;
or three drop'dead, and others receive wounds.&#xD;
" Each man to a tree !" shouted Lorrimer.&#xD;
"Yes, every man to a tree !" cried the leaders of therespective parties.&#xD;
".And don't yield an inch while you'have strength to load and fire !" added&#xD;
N oon.,       A'","        F"F''''&#xD;
"Whoop ! death to tie foes of the 'white man and the Lipan 1'? cried War.&#xD;

"Be on your guard against Manl Hart and his two-villains,' said Noel to&#xD;

his remaining opponent around his body, and lifting him tip cast him to the earth&#xD;
falling with all his weight upon his chest, 'driving the breath from his hinge, and&#xD;
for a moment paralysing all his faculties.&#xD;
Maurice glanced about for a weapon, and seeing a h1unting-knife 'uear hire,&#xD;

42                    THE MAID OF TIE RANCE.&#xD;
The day just ended, had furnished his first experience in warfare,:and he natu.&#xD;
rally dwelt on the scenes through which he had passed. He had shed blood, and&#xD;
his better thoughts instinctivelyshrank from the memory of. what he had done.&#xD;
Ile had fought in selt defence, but even that rejection failed to make him feel&#xD;
quite at ease. Some internal monitor seemed to -tell him that it was wrong to&#xD;
take life under any circumstances, although the whole civilized world would justi-&#xD;
fy him in doing as he had.       .&#xD;
He was absorbed in meditations of his nature, when}the restless movements of&#xD;
honest advised him thatsome person was approaching. Looking between the&#xD;
intervening trees,. Maurice beheld an individual of erect carriage and assured&#xD;
bearing, deliberately advancing. Honest walked towards the intruder, growling,&#xD;
but he spoke to him in a conciliating tone, and the animal eyeing him sharply,.&#xD;
made no farther hostile demonstrations.&#xD;
Your dog is trying to read my character, I perceive, sir,"remarked the stran-&#xD;
ger.                                        .&#xD;
"And I believe he has succeeded before this time," replied Maurice.&#xD;
" Wonderful instincts have dogs. I some times wish I was a dog myself," re-&#xD;
turned the other.&#xD;
"A. singular fancy, truly," observed our hero, with a smile.&#xD;
"I will tell you why I have had-such a strange whim. It is because dogs are&#xD;
capable of acting disinterestedly. They can feel a friendship which death only&#xD;
can extinguish. They are faithful creatures-they do their best, and those that&#xD;
do their best, man or beast, do their duty,.and all that can be required of them."&#xD;
"There is reason in that."&#xD;
"So there is in your dog. Just look at his large eyes ; are they not half&#xD;
human in their expression ?  He's worth a king's ransom 1"&#xD;
"More than that, to me," said Maurice.&#xD;
" By the way, I have heard rumors of a fight."&#xD;
" There has been one ; yes, two, for that matter."&#xD;
And-"&#xD;
"The Texan rifles have been victorious."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear it. You perhaps saw something of the fray. How was&#xD;
it ?"&#xD;
Harper stated what has been described,'to which' recital the strangerlist-&#xD;
ened with deed interest.&#xD;
"So you have been engaged for the first time. What do you think of it ?"&#xD;
" I regret the necessity that compels men to slay each other, be they red or&#xD;
white," returned Maurice.&#xD;
" A proper feeling ; but stern necessity compels us to fight, at the present&#xD;
crisis. I have heard that the hunters up in'this region were raising a band of&#xD;
brave lads to oppose the march of the myrmidons of the Dictator of Mexico ?"&#xD;
" True again. Fair lips have nameli them ; they',are to be called, ' The&#xD;
Hunters of the Border.'"&#xD;
"A smoothly going title, really; it sounds feminine, and I hope the boya who&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MAID Or THE RANCHE                       43&#xD;
bear it will not dishonor themselves by an act of cruelty or cowardice.  Who&#xD;
is to lead this redoubtable band ?"&#xD;
'"Your humble servant has been talked of," replied Maurice, coloring ; "bet&#xD;
I think I shall decline in favor of one older, and more experienced."&#xD;
"Yes, experience and courage are two requisites to be combined in a military&#xD;
leader. Veterans are needed, no doubt, to fill responsible offices."&#xD;
" I intend to win my position, before I accept' any place of trust, be it high&#xD;
or low," returned Maurice, somewhat proudly.&#xD;
"Quite right. I respect the feeling that prompts you to take such a course."&#xD;
"May I ask who you are ?" inquired Maurice, now turning full upon the&#xD;
stranger, aTd regarding him steadily.&#xD;
"It's ani honest question, and deftly put. I am called Dorville."&#xD;
"iDorville ; I don't remember to have hdard it ; but I daresay it's a very&#xD;
good name. You carry a rifle, and appear to- be rigged cap-a-pie in hunter's&#xD;
garb."&#xD;
"Which, being interpreted, is equivalent to asking what my business is ? You&#xD;
have guessed it ; I am a hunter. Come, lead the way to your camp. I should&#xD;
like to see some of your fellows."&#xD;
" You are a true man, I suppose ?"&#xD;
" That remains to be proved. There can be but two ways about it-I am, or&#xD;
I am not ; let time show. You carry a rifle, also, and are dressed in the style&#xD;
of the backwoodsman ?"&#xD;
"I am what you see."&#xD;
"Not a native of this part of the country ?"&#xD;
"I am not."&#xD;
"From Virginia, perhaps ?"&#xD;
Maurice paused, colored slightly, and looked at the stranger before replying.&#xD;
" Yes, Mr. D Qrville, I am from the State you have mentioned."&#xD;
" Perhaps your name is Harper ?"&#xD;
"That's what I answer to. I shall begin to suspect that you are a conjurer,&#xD;
soon."&#xD;
"News always flies rapidly, especially bad news. I am somewhat ubiquitous,&#xD;
Mr. Harper."&#xD;
'And ambiguous, too, I should say."&#xD;
* Possibly."&#xD;
'I cannot say that I understand you."&#xD;
".Well, I am in the habit of travelling through this portion of country, and&#xD;
hear pretty much all that transpires ; so your name is not unknown to me."&#xD;
"Not discreditably known, I hope ?"&#xD;
"You probably best know whether you deserve to be known favorably or&#xD;
-       otherwise," replied Dorville, somewhat drily.&#xD;
"I certainly do, Land pardon me if I choose to consider it a matter relating ex-&#xD;
elusively to myself."&#xD;

Our hero, who had at first been considerably impressed in favorof the stran-&#xD;
ger, soon began to feel differently towards him. Miss EIsthburn was nothing to&#xD;
hm,it was true, bat he did not lke to hear in spealc of er insuch a familiar&#xD;

"Perhaps you had better speak to the young lady's father," he added, with&#xD;
quiet sarcasm.&#xD;
"That might do for you, young man, but I prefer to address myself to the&#xD;
lady herself."&#xD;
Harper felt that his face was in a glow, and for nioent he fervently ished&#xD;
that the assured and rbane Daryile yes in some distant locality.  Still the&#xD;
stranger interested him., There was somet i  bg 99nt him that was pleasing,&#xD;
notwithstanding his presumptidn; for presumptip opr ;iero esteemed his gonver-&#xD;
,sation concerning Iris athkur&#xD;
But there was another thing o be considered ; would not this pleasing some-&#xD;
thing about the man Dorville be likely also toattract the attention of the fair&#xD;
maiden in question ? Certainly I nothing more probable. The girl saw but lit-&#xD;
tie society, and the appearance of such a peron as Dorville would obviously&#xD;
produce an effect on her youthful imagination. Indeed, such a result might rea-&#xD;
sonably be looked for ; and perhaps he-bhd alxerdy dazzled her girlish fancy.&#xD;
-*hatiif, le had ? Had he any claims on Miss  thburn ? No. .Had he ever&#xD;

to form a different judgement.&#xD;
erties teaehed the encampment. It was a spot near the river,,oi an&#xD;
&#xD;
open piece of- bottom land. Several small huts or camps had been erected for&#xD;
the accommodation of those who were willing to unite to meet the common en-&#xD;
emy. By the joint efforts of Noel Noon, Lorrimer, Harper, and others, quite a&#xD;
number had already gathered. Those that had horses :had -ridden them-to the&#xD;
encampment, and such as had none managed to purchase -them. Several 'per-&#xD;
sons who-had formerly'-belonged to the Moderators and Regulators, had joined&#xD;
this little band, and were now ready 'to be led against the-fotee of Santa Anna.&#xD;
A leader had not yet been selected. Harper had been talked of 'to fill this&#xD;
qice, principally through the instrumentality of Noon and Lorrimer. But the&#xD;
young .man was a stranger to most of them, and =it seemed, also,.that }reports not&#xD;
very favorable to the character of Maurice had by some 'feans, and .threagh&#xD;
some channel, reached the ears of the men--Noon among the number, as has&#xD;
been noticed in another place.&#xD;
When Harper and Dorville appeared, the recruits were gathered;in groups id&#xD;
various spots, conversing upon this subject- There was much talking, gesticu-&#xD;
lation, apd grave shaking of heads in relation to the matter. Noel Noon stood&#xD;
a little aloof, regarding the proceeedings with a serious and troubled expreision.&#xD;
Lorrirper approached-him, having the same uneasy look.&#xD;
"Thy're goin' to vote," he said gloomily. " How will it go, think you'?"&#xD;
".Agin him."&#xD;
" I think po, Lorrimer, and-and I'm sorry. He's a fine appearin' lad, and&#xD;
would make a good officer."&#xD;
"Yes, but the men have been 'influenced. They want to know if you'll'stand&#xD;
s a candidate ?"&#xD;
"No, I couldn't," said Noon, thoughtfully. " I've promised that young man&#xD;
ny friendship, and I can't think of goin' agin him."&#xD;
"Better have you than.a worse man, friend Noon"&#xD;
"I can't do it, and you may tell 'em so. If they'll choose him the first offi-&#xD;
cer, I wont greatly object to 'hem' second. 'But I wont do nothin' different. He&#xD;
may be to blame, but I'll stick to him ; that's my natur, and I can't get over it."&#xD;
" It's a true, manly, sort of senterment, I know, but then Manuel Hart amt&#xD;
the man to lead me again' the Mexicans."&#xD;
" Manuel Hart 1",exclaimed Noon, with a start.&#xD;
"That's the name tlat'll be afore 'em, if you decline."&#xD;
"Lorrimer, you're the oldest-you're the man as can best 'lead us to battle.&#xD;
I'll speak of it, and you mustn't, on no account, say nothin' again it."&#xD;
"I can fight wel,.perhaps, Noel Noon, but I can't do much in military way,&#xD;
I'm afeared. I know my own daty, but I don't know that of other folks."&#xD;
" That's what we. went-egample, and'not'talk. -.If you ride up to the enemy&#xD;
boldly, others will ride after and imitate you. So say no more."&#xD;
"ant I'd rather fuller you or the young man, Harper?'&#xD;
"dAb, there he comes! I'l go and speak to him about 'this onpleasant matter&#xD;
and kind of prepare him for the'disappointment," said Noon.&#xD;
" Break it to him kind of gentle like," added Lorrimer.&#xD;

Noel advanced to meet Harper, who was already coming towards him with&#xD;
Doryille.&#xD;
"Iow do you do, Noel Noon ?" said the latter.,&#xD;
" We've met afore, I believe," returned the hunter, scanning hin closely.&#xD;
"Yes, several times ; but my memory is better than yours, it seems."&#xD;
"Now I remember ; your name is Dorville. Glad to see you among us; that&#xD;
is, if you come with the right kind of feelin's."&#xD;
" We shall see, Noon, we shall see why and for what I come, all in good&#xD;
time. '.Perhaps yop want to speak with IMr. Harper 2"&#xD;
"Yes, I have got a few words tosay to him.  This way, friend Harper, if&#xD;
you please.. The fact is," he continued, taking the arm of Maurice, "affairs are&#xD;
taking a strange turn agin' you. There seems to be some secret undercurrent&#xD;
at work, carryin'' you dowzn stream, so to speak as 'twere."&#xD;
a "I know it-I feel it, friend Noon," said our hero, earnestly.,&#xD;
"They're throwin' ;ou overboard, I'm afeared. I thought I'd warn you of it,&#xD;
so you needn't feel too much disappointed when you come to hear ont."&#xD;
"My good Noel, I shan't be much disappointed, for I've already made up my&#xD;
mind to give up all thoughts of being a leader, at present. I mean to win my&#xD;
place, before I am elevated to~any post of trust and honor. You must be pur&#xD;
captain."&#xD;
"Me! rude Noel Noon ! No !. I'm firm on that pint. If you was to be&#xD;
first, I'd be second with pride and pleasure, but on no other conditions."'&#xD;
"This sacrifice you are making for me. Pray don't; change your mind. I&#xD;
want no better, bolder, truer leader than yourself."&#xD;
" I'm jest like a rock, Maurice Harper ;, it's of no use for you to keep ham-&#xD;
merin' at me, expectin' to change my mind, for it can't be done."&#xD;
"Brave Noel I" exclaimed Harper, and then relapsed into silence. At the ex-&#xD;
piration of a few seconds he roiused himself and asked :&#xD;
"Do you know the reason of this sudden change of sentiment among the&#xD;
Men?"&#xD;
"I. couldn't say as I'm altogether ignorant of it. It's some kind of rumor or&#xD;
another. that's got afloat."&#xD;
" I should like to know what it is," returned Maurice, earnestly.&#xD;
" Perhaps you'll know some day or other," rejoined Noel, hesitatingly.&#xD;
"I see one yonder who looks like Manuel Hart," said the young man quite&#xD;
abruptly.    =&#xD;
. "He's aursng us, and I'm sorry for it, for he'll never be a good friend of yours.&#xD;
"He wona fight, Noel ; therp's nro true courage in him."&#xD;
" That's ry opinion ;, but he can make mischief."&#xD;
" Well, let things take their course ; be assured that I have nothing to fear.&#xD;
The rule of eternal rectitude will prevail. The guilty, the false, the cowardly,&#xD;

"I bave observed that there is a discordant element at work-that 'aniifuin.&#xD;
ence hostile to myself is rife among those with whom I had hoped to associate&#xD;
on the best of terms-as brothers in arms. If Manuel Hart slanders my name&#xD;
-if he places a false mark of calumny upon me, let him look well to it, for I&#xD;
will track him out and punish his basenesss. I could even now justly accuse&#xD;
him of a serious crime-that of attempting my life, as he did through the instru-&#xD;
mentality of Meltiah Moss. But, as you know, I have been silent on that sub-&#xD;
ject, choosing to bide my time, and permit him to lay his schemes, and go un-&#xD;
whipt a little longer. Believe me, I am watching yonder backwoodsman, and&#xD;
the time approaches when I will unmask him. His audacity in appearing here&#xD;
in my sight, and among persons collected partly through my influence, is aston-&#xD;
ishing."&#xD;
"I wonder at it myself ; but see,.they are voting."&#xD;
" I care but little how this affair turns, so far as the desire to be a leade- is&#xD;
concerned ; but I should not like to be defeated by unfair and underhand&#xD;
means."&#xD;
"Here comes Lorrimer and Dorville. Now we'll learn how it's goin'."&#xD;
".Who is this Dorville ?"&#xD;
" That's what I should really like to know myself."&#xD;
" Then you have no knowledge of his character, residence, or pursuits?"&#xD;
"I couldn't say that I have; I've met him, and that's all. Here they are.&#xD;
Flow goes the battle ?"&#xD;
"They'll come themselves and tell us. I've no heart to'talk about it."&#xD;
"Then it's gone against our wishes ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Dorville, "I presume- it has, in some'respects, although you will&#xD;
loubtless be pleased to hear that our friend Lorrimaer is to be your captain."&#xD;
" That pleases us," said Harper, with a smile.&#xD;
"W'o is second in command ?" inquired Noon,:anxiously.&#xD;
" Manuel Hart," rejoined forville, fixing his eyes steadily upon Maurice.&#xD;
"That's bad-bad enough ! I wonder who had the chief agency in his eloo-&#xD;
tion ?"&#xD;
" Rathburn."&#xD;
"Rathburn I" exclaimed Harper, blushing to the temples.&#xD;
- "The same--the young lady's father whom we recently talked of," returned&#xD;
Dorville, calmly.&#xD;
Noel:and Maurice looked at each other, and both appeared ccuofused.&#xD;
" There's something wrong here, and I half wish that 'The Hunters of the&#xD;
Border,' had never been raised by our, agency."&#xD;
" Do not entertain such feelings on my account, but think only of the high ob-&#xD;
jeetwhich we have in view-the rescue of this unhappy and distracted country&#xD;
fron Mexican ttirall."&#xD;
".A worthy sentiment, certainly. I applaud your motives," resigned Dorville.&#xD;
" I trust none of ua have any selfish incentives toseek the field. At least, I&#xD;

whom both felt a deeper interest than they were willing to acknowledge.:&#xD;

" Such fights are dreadful to think of! Why do the Moderators and Regula.&#xD;

Because the Regulators need to be segulated, and the Moderators mean to do&#xD;
it. It can't be helped."&#xD;
"When)will the hunters of the Border 'march down the Brazos ?" added the&#xD;
maiden'&#xD;
"Right away. Old Lorrimer---not a fit person for a captain, by a great deal&#xD;
-is-bent on going' after the Mexicans ; but it seems to me there's fightin' en-&#xD;
ough nearer home to keep us all busy. For instance, in conferdence atween you&#xD;

Other'remarks followed which did not reach Harper's ears, and then Hart gli-&#xD;
ded away as he came. - What Maurice had heard did not increase his happiness,&#xD;
having a pretty well-founded suspicion that it, in some way; had relation to&#xD;
himself. He waited until ten or fifteen minutes had elapsed after Hart's depar-&#xD;
ture, and then he proceeded to the window which had been the scene of the re-&#xD;
cent interview. He was not quiteso assured and bold, however, as his prede-&#xD;
cessor had appeared, but nevertheless he tapped upon the sash in the same&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
There was a momentary pause, then he heard a light step within. The win-&#xD;
dow :was not raised, but a voice inquired who was there?&#xD;
"Maurice Harper," returned the young man.       J&#xD;
Iris recoiled a step, and was'obviously surprised and disconcerted.&#xD;
" I have not come to harm you," said Maurice, calmly.&#xD;
Iris hastily raised the window, as if ashamed of her embarrassment and dis-&#xD;
trust, if indeed she had felt anything of the latter.'&#xD;
"Thinking that you might' very naturally experience - feelings of uneasiness,&#xD;
knowing that enemies are in the vicinity, my friend,Noel Noon is keeping watch&#xD;
near the Ranche, in order to secure your safety. I thought this information&#xD;
might make you happier, and secure your rest through the night," said Maurice,&#xD;
respectfully."&#xD;
Iris colored. "Is he alone ?" she inquired. '&#xD;
"No ; a young man is with him," replied Maurice.-&#xD;
"Â«May I ask his name?"      -&#xD;
"Really, I do not happen to recall it, at this moment, but you will certainly'&#xD;
be warned, if danger approaches."&#xD;
" I thak you, Mr. Harper."&#xD;
" No thanks tome, Miss Rathburn. Noel Noon alone deserves them."&#xD;
Iris:Rathbup looked earnestly at Maurice, but his face did not express any&#xD;
peculiar emotions ; it was placid and even cold in its expression.&#xD;
"'So Baptiste Lorrimer is your captain ?" said Iris,, as if tc prolong the con.&#xD;
'ersation.&#xD;

THE MAID Of THE RANOHE.                       51&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Rathburn ; I was rejected as a candidate, almost unanimously."&#xD;
Again the maiden scanned the features of Maurice. She wondered to hear&#xD;
him talk of' the matter so quietly, and with the manifestation of so little=dis-&#xD;
appointment. She had thought 'that he would probably speak of it with oon-&#xD;
siderable bitterness.&#xD;
" Captain Lorrimer will make an excellent officer. I shall gladly follow him&#xD;
to the field, to battle, and through danger," he resumed.&#xD;
" And how are you pleased with your second officer?" asked' the young lady,&#xD;
with an effort.&#xD;
"Excuse me,~Miss Rathburn ; do not press ipe to express my opinion. I pre-&#xD;

" I will owe it to both, if you please."&#xD;
"'As you will.. May you all display courage and fidelity in the discharge of&#xD;
duty."&#xD;
"I shall prize those qualities more since you admire them," returned Maurice,&#xD;
with more warmth.&#xD;
"Express my obligation to Mr. Noon and the young man with him, whgso&#xD;
name you do not happen to recall," said Miss Rathburn, with some trepidation.&#xD;
Maurice bowed.&#xD;
"It is singular that father has not returned before this time," added Iris.&#xD;
"He has been busy with the men, I believe, since the battle," returned *b&#xD;
young man.&#xD;
"In relation to the choice of leaders ?".&#xD;
"I think so, although I have takn so little interest in the matter,that I can-&#xD;
not be confident en that poig't."&#xD;
" Was he in favor of those who were chosen?"&#xD;
" Really 1 am not qualifieA to say, but perhaps Mr. Hart will be able to giye&#xD;
you definite information," rejoined Maurice, in tones that appeared to Miss Rath.'&#xD;
burn to be slightly sarcastic. She had entertained an uneasy suspicion that&#xD;
Maurice bad been a witness to the interview between herself and Manuel hart,&#xD;
and his last answer confirmed it. She was too much disconcerted to make an&#xD;
immediate reply, and her face and neck were suffused with a crimson glow.&#xD;
Maurice instinctively fathomed her thoughts, but made no efforts ,to remove&#xD;
her suspicions, or exculpate himself from the charge of being an inquisitive, delib-&#xD;
erate listener to matters that did not require the presence of a third person.&#xD;
" I think I understand the meaning of your last, remark. What has trans-&#xD;
pired, I could not prevent ; and," she added, in a lower voice, " am I not mis-&#xD;
tres of my own actions?"&#xD;
" You have discretion enough to be, certainly, Miss Rathburp. I hope a mind&#xD;
like yours will never be forced to act otherwise than voluntarily."&#xD;
"I see how I am misconstrued, Mr. Harper; but, pardon me, I do not-do&#xD;

:Ard it: is.not wonderful that suspicion of his new acquaintance should awaken&#xD;
a slight twinge of Jealousy in his mind.&#xD;
He restrained his displeasure, and remained passively at his post, awaiting the&#xD;
denouient whatever-it might be. Bit nothing uncommon transpired."-After&#xD;
walking noiselessly about the place for a shorttime, he turned on his heel and&#xD;
went away.&#xD;
Maurice rejoiced at his departure, end asked himself:whoswould next appent,&#xD;

At the expiration of that period, a more startling manifestation occurred. A&#xD;
party of six persons, mounted upon horses, rode up to the corral, when one of&#xD;
them'dismounted-and approached tiewindow which had already been the scene&#xD;
of two interviews. Harper~tlioghthe, recognized the figure, but resolved to&#xD;

CHAPTER .IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
OCCURRENCES AT THE RANCHE.&#xD;
Tagnthree persons indicated, threw their bridles ,to their companions, and dis-&#xD;
mounting passed through the corral to join Meltiab. Harper perceived at a&#xD;
glance that Jack Wild, or Jack Lawless, as he was indiscriminately termed, was&#xD;
one of the actors'in the scene,&#xD;
He now deemed it time to interfere, in order to prevent the contemplated out-&#xD;
rage upon the personal liberty of the two maidens,. As he advanced quickly to-&#xD;
wards the window, he heard the young ladies 'utter cries of alarm, and with a&#xD;
bound he sprang through it and stood in the midst of the parties. Honest, who&#xD;
never was a laggard in a good cause, followed close at his master's heels. .Coi-&#xD;
siderable astonishment was depicted on the countenances of these four worthies&#xD;
at ithe unexpected debut of, our bold Virginian."&#xD;
" You're thar, ar ye ?" exclaimed Lawless, with a wicked leer of the eye.&#xD;
"You've come without an invite, I take it, sorter,' said Meltiab, in his care-&#xD;
lespway. -&#xD;
Grasping his double-barrel rife firmly, Maurice stood erect and silent, re-&#xD;
gagding them without quailing, deigning no answer,:while Honest sat watchful&#xD;
,zo the left of the parties, and clsping each other by the hand, stood Iris and&#xD;
Ramona, tremblingly awaiting the issue of the reneontre.&#xD;
A'qung ladies,'' said Maurice, ' is it your wish to go with these men ?'&#xD;
" No, No I1'Mriedboth in scbreath.&#xD;
"'Then you shkelne*,"replied the yonng-man.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE .,AID_ OF THE RANOH E.                   55&#xD;
'That's putting' it rayther strong, I reckon," added Moss.&#xD;
I allow," said Lawless, raising his Carbite and leveling it at Honest, "that&#xD;
it's time for that four-footed panther to go under."&#xD;
Maurice instantly stepped before: the dog, and drew from his hunting sack a&#xD;
six barrel revolving pistol,&#xD;
"Fire, and it will bethesignal for your own;death.!" he said, sternly.&#xD;
Lawlessdropped the butt of his carbine sullenly to the floor, muttering-:.&#xD;
.Thar agin ; allers thar,! But the time'l come when I'll see both of ye kick&#xD;
the bucket, and knock under in a way as'11 be uncommon."&#xD;
"I calkerlate as this here business musn't be interrupted,",added Meltiah.&#xD;
"We've come arter these gals," resumed Lawless, in a swaggering tone.&#xD;
"You can't have them," rejoined Harper, firmly.&#xD;
"Seein' there's six to one, I'm decided that we can," said Mess.&#xD;
Here are sir barrels,.not mentioning my double rifle and Honest," returned&#xD;
Maurice, unmoved.&#xD;
"I've a notion that we've got more nor six barrels amongusand it's my pri-&#xD;
vate opinion expressed in this here public. manner, that we shan't stand and be&#xD;
shot one after tother in the. way you talk of," continued Meltiah.&#xD;
" Close upround the fermernines, my lads I" cried Lawless,&#xD;
" Keep as near me as you can," said Harper, to the affrighted girls.&#xD;
When Maurice had given this direction he fired one barrel of his revolver out&#xD;
of the. window. Taking advantage of this movement, Meltiah extinguished the&#xD;
light, leaving the room in total darkness. With a quick perception of his dan-&#xD;
ger, Maurice instantly changed his position, thereby avoiding a crushing blow&#xD;
aimed at him by Lawless with the breech of his- carbine.&#xD;
It was now difficult to discover friend from fde, but knowing the exact position&#xD;
of the maidens, two of the fellows had sprang towards them and were now stri-&#xD;
ving to drag them to- the door. Maurice sezied one of ruffians by the collar, and&#xD;
struck him upon the head with his revolver, a blow that caused him to drop to&#xD;
the floor like a dead man.&#xD;
Honest, meantime, perceiving that violent hands were being laid upon Iris,&#xD;
seized the other rogue and used him so roughly, that he began to think more of&#xD;
saving his own life than carrying off the females.' Two;were now down and&#xD;
Harper discharged his pistol at random, at, Moss and Lawless, who had hitherto&#xD;
restrained their fire lest they should harm the girls, or alarm those who might be&#xD;
in the vicinity, arid thus produce a'rescue.&#xD;
In the midst of this excitement and confusion, Noel Noon burst ppen the door&#xD;
and appeared among the combatants.. The door being open, sufficient light was&#xD;
admitted to allow the respect ive actors ,in this scene to be visible. Both Law-&#xD;
lessandMeltiah now thought it time to attend to their personal safety, and dcsk-&#xD;
ed out of the window, followed by theircomradewho had been  rostrated by a&#xD;
blow from Maurice's revolver, and wh had sufficientlyrecovered himself to&#xD;
make good his escape. Only one of therbelligerent party remained, andhe could&#xD;
not Io easily extricate himself from the difficulty in which he had become involv-&#xD;

Turning to Maurice, he'addd:&#xD;

" These young ladies oan tell 'you, pe-haps, better than I ; but the sum and&#xD;

At this interesting crisis, Baptiste Lorringer-and.Dorville made their appear&#xD;

tentions to'theunconscious'Iris, glided unnoticedfrom the house, fullof thought,&#xD;
and agitated by conjetires in relation to what had happened, sought the encamp-&#xD;
ment, Honest walking leisurely and contentedly by his side.&#xD;
He had not staid to receive thanks or congratulations, because, under present&#xD;
circumstances, he was not ambitious to be thus noticed.- He : could not forget&#xD;
the unjust insinuations of Miss Ratliburn,.in regard to the motives that bad in-&#xD;
duced him to be nea- the Ranlse. ' He was not angry but sorrowful, for, he felt&#xD;
that his conduct had teen entirely misconstrued. He did not attach any blame&#xD;
to the maiden, for it appeared to himthat "the was laboring at the time under&#xD;
misapprehensions, of sorne kind, in relation to him.&#xD;
When Iris had regained her consciousness, she was the firstto remark-the ab&#xD;
sence of the brave Virginian,.&#xD;
"He never stays after work's done, I take it," said Noel Noon, inreply to her&#xD;
inquiring looks.&#xD;
"What, gone 1" asked Ramona.&#xD;
"It rayther has that appearance, now," Noel replied.&#xD;
"Gone, and we 'hae not expressed our gratitude l"exclaimed Miss Rathburn.&#xD;
"I'll say to him whatever you thinkis right, be it more or less, common or&#xD;
uncommon, ordinary or extr'ordinary," added the forester.&#xD;
" Perhaps she prefers to deliver her own "messages," suggested Lorrimer&#xD;
"I wonder who could have been at the bottom  of' this transaction ?" said&#xD;
Dorville.&#xD;
Neither Lorrimer nor Noel made any answer to this interrogatory. f' Come,&#xD;
men, give your opinion," added'Dorville.&#xD;
Opinions are like the truth ; not to be spoken at all times," answered Lor-&#xD;
rimer.&#xD;
"I'm not, afraid to speak mine, generally," rejoined Dorville.&#xD;
"Nobodylaid anything about being afraid, Mr. Dorville," replied Lorrimer&#xD;
drily.&#xD;
"It seems'to amount to that. When people refuse to speak out frankly and&#xD;
boldly, in a case like this, the idea always oedurs to me that they are afraid to ;&#xD;
but perhaps I am wrong," rejoined Dorville.&#xD;
-" I splose Lorrimer is thinking of expedieney," said Noon.&#xD;
dd1you are.in the same train of thought,'ioubtless. Well, I see which&#xD;
way the wind blows, and will not At this time boast myown 1supefior courage,&#xD;

Bamona and Iris looked atseach other'inquiringly, as if to read each-other's&#xD;
thoughts, and ask what might be the nature of theirlfriends' reflections.  .&#xD;
"I think," continued.Dorville, fixing his eyes ;earnestly upon Iris, " that this&#xD;
matterought to be inquired into. - That there has, in this' case, been ;an unlaw-&#xD;
ful attempt to abduct these young women, cannot be doubted., If there hasbeen&#xD;
such a design, there must necessarily havebeen a designer; and it is: thetlatter&#xD;
that we ought to seek out, unmask and punish., If no other person feels disposed&#xD;
to this duty, I shall takedit upon myself."&#xD;
" Your ideas are similar to my own. I shan't by no means allow you to be&#xD;
the only one to do this business. I shall .on all properioccasions, be tryin' to&#xD;
ferret out the mystery. That Mr. Rathburn sent them ruffians here to conduct&#xD;
his daughters to a place of safety is highly improbable, and sunthin' like settin'&#xD;
a wolf to catch a lamb," said Noon.&#xD;
" Herb cornea Rathburn ; let him speak for himself," said Lorrimer.&#xD;
Rathburp entered the house, apparently somewhat excited.&#xD;
"I have just learned," he said, "from the:,Virginian,,that there has been vil-&#xD;
lany attempted here. How is it ? Are you uninjured, girls ?"&#xD;
"Yes ; thanks to Mr. Harper and Mr. Noon," replied Ramona.&#xD;
"We were pretty sartain that you hadn't given any orders to have the gals&#xD;
removed," said Lorrimer.&#xD;
" Of course not," added'Dorville, fixing- his penetrating eyes upon Rathburn.&#xD;
"Being so near, what need had I to send when I could come myself, and the.&#xD;
danger being comparatively little ?" he answered. -&#xD;
"What more natural than that a father should desire to be with his children&#xD;
when danger.menaces,?  No honest man-nobody but a mercenary hireling&#xD;
would.entrust even his dog to the care of such worthless knaves as have this&#xD;
night invaded his dwelling," Continued Dorville, still looking at Rathburn.&#xD;
The latter slightly changed color and turned to Noon with the inquiry, " If&#xD;
6e knew any.of the parties?"&#xD;
"They had all fled.but one when I reached the room, and I can't say that I&#xD;
know much about him," rejoined Noel,&#xD;
" We owe our safety to the brave youngaman;".remarked Iris. -&#xD;
"I must.speak to hin on the subject," said Rathburn, now considerably embar&#xD;
rassed.&#xD;
"If Mr. Rathbur, had:not been kept away by business of vital importance&#xD;
he would 'unquestionably have been here to defend these fair creatures from out-&#xD;
rage and peril," resumed Dorville, in the same measured tone, and with the same&#xD;
fixed gaze at Rathburn.&#xD;
" You are right, sir-my heart is alwayswith my dear girls," returned Rath.&#xD;
burn, in a more earnest voice. .&#xD;
"We shall march down the Brazosato-morrow or the day after, and I've been&#xD;
thinking thatUthis willlbe:vather an geposed situation for you," said the captain.&#xD;
" It might be unsafe here for most settlers, but with me the case is rather dif.&#xD;

"Wont that be rayther an onsartain dependence?' asked Noel, quickly.&#xD;
"No; far from it. ' I've lived herenow going on four years, and have never had&#xD;
any trouble to speak of."&#xD;
"But there's,'never been a war with Mexico before," remarked the captain.&#xD;
-   , J "I know it, but there wont many of the enemy getup so far as'my'Ranche. It's&#xD;
an out of the way place, you see. What do the Mexicans want up here ?"&#xD;
"You night have asked 'em that question a few hours ago when We was fight-&#xD;
in''em out yopfder, not a.mile from here,"&#xD;
",But, they are so thoroughly whipped, they wont come again. I'll remain where&#xD;
I am. What else can I do ?"&#xD;
"'You might go with us to some of the larger towns, where there is but little&#xD;
danger of the approach of an enemy."&#xD;
"It wont do-there's as much-chance of safety here as anywhere. Tetas;will&#xD;
be trodden under foot by the troops of Santa Anna, before a year goes over our&#xD;
heads,,and the most obscure places will be safer from plunder and violence. A&#xD;
few of us can defend this spot against almost any number of Mexicans. You&#xD;
see they are afraid of the American rifles."&#xD;
" Well, turn it over in your mind, friend Rathburn, between now and to-mor'&#xD;
row noon, and if you conclude to go with us, depend on't, not a hair of the gals'&#xD;
heads shall be harmed, though we should meet the Dictator'himself, at thihead&#xD;
of an army."&#xD;
"It's a kind offer, father," observed Iris.&#xD;
"Yes ; I'll reflect upon it, Captain Lorrimer."&#xD;
"You'd better. But it's getting late, and' I must return to camp. We'll' all&#xD;
remain, however, if you think it best."&#xD;
" We shall-not probably be disturbed again to-night. So you can go, gentle&#xD;
men, with clean consciences," replied 'Rathburn.&#xD;
As they were preparing to depart,.Iris stole to the'side of Noon, anid asked&#xD;
the name of the young man who was so good as to keep guard with him, and&#xD;
where he was that he did not appear when the disturbance occurred.&#xD;
" Who said there was a young man with me ?"&#xD;
" Mr. Harper informed me, but could not recallihis name," added Iris.&#xD;
".He said that, did he? Well, Maurice Harper was the young man, and no-&#xD;
body else, and you see his native modesty wouldn't let him tell you," returned&#xD;
Noon.&#xD;
" Iow stupid and unjust I" she exclaimed, blushing with regret; at the remem-&#xD;
brance of what she had said to him.&#xD;
"Mr. Nocl,'' she hastily added, in a low voice, "I've wronged your friend."&#xD;
" Sorry for it, Miss Iris! He's under the cloud, as t'were, now, buts you 'e&#xD;
he wont allers be there, I expect. He's got enemies that mean td crushrhii; but&#xD;
I for one shall stand by him, notwithstanding all that 'malice and envy can do to&#xD;
blight his prospects."&#xD;

"Iris can tell you what I have said when I am gone. I hear your father's&#xD;
step-Dorville goes-adios, adios?"&#xD;
When Dorville reached the encampment, the fires were burning dimly, and the&#xD;
wing of'sleep hung silently over the scene. A little removed from the spot two&#xD;
or three sentinels kept sleepless watch. Instead of; entering one of the huts, Dor-&#xD;
ville wrapped his blanket about him and laid down upon the earth as content-&#xD;
edly as one might seek his dreams in a bed anduander a sheltering roof. He'was&#xD;
sinking into a quiet slumber, when he was disturbed by the-footsteps of some one&#xD;
more restless than himself. Opening his eyes he beheld'Maurice walking slowly&#xD;
past him.&#xD;
"Is that you, Mr. Harper ?  Can you not reconcile your conscience to sleep ?"&#xD;
said Dorville.&#xD;
" I have few antagonisms of that nature to reconcile," returned Maurice.&#xD;
" Then why not go to rest ?  The night is fast waning ; the small hours have&#xD;
come."&#xD;
" Well, let them come and go ; I care not."&#xD;
" Come, don't be disheartened. There's a tide in human  affairs, you know ?&#xD;
You can find a couch sufficiently soft in some of the camps, I dare say."&#xD;
"Sufficiently soft ? this soil is soft enough for me."&#xD;
Harper, stretched himself upon the ground, and placing his rifle carefully by&#xD;
his side, indicated plainly that he thought of 'going to sleep.  Honest followed&#xD;
his master's example with an equal manifestation of indifference.&#xD;
"I shouldn't care about sleeping with no blanket between me and the soil,"&#xD;
observed Dorville.&#xD;
"1I like mother earth ; she strengthens me. I recieve quiet dreams and refresh-&#xD;
ing sleep from her bosom. Don't disparage her."&#xD;
"Heaven forbid that I should speak lightly of mother earth, or any part of na-&#xD;
ture. I have too long been the subject of her ministrations to be ungrateful and&#xD;
captious."&#xD;
" Who goes yonder, I wonder ?" asked Harper.&#xD;
"t is one who treads softly as if he did not wish to attract attention."&#xD;
" Yes ; so I perceive.'&#xD;
" It is Manuel Hart, I think, Mr. Harper."&#xD;
"You are right, Dorville. Where has -e been, do you imagine ?"&#xD;
"I don't always tell what I imagine ; so good night."&#xD;
Harper closed his eyes and soon appeared to be sleeping ; but partly unel*sing&#xD;
them awhile after, he saw Dorville with his'head turned a little,.looking at'hini.&#xD;
Harper'there upon began to ask himself what kind! of an opinion he-had form-&#xD;
ed of this stranger, and what influence, if any, he would'exercise upon his destiny&#xD;
-whether for good 'or for evil. Of course he had no means of deciding this&#xD;
question, and he tried to dismiss it altogether as idle and even;whimsical.&#xD;

CHAPTER XL&#xD;
HE-BATTLE ON THE HORSE joGP.&#xD;
THEHupters of the Border had movgd down the Brazos and were near San&#xD;
Astonio. They had joined a small detacmatent under Coloinel .Bo ie, and were&#xD;
soon watching the move ents of the enemy who were hovering abo t exar like&#xD;
birds of prey ready to pounceupon any party of Texans less formidable, nuneri-&#xD;
cally, thpn themselves. The hunters had found an excellent camping ground in&#xD;
a bend of the river, distinguished, on account of its peculiar shape, as the ",Iorse&#xD;
Shoe."&#xD;
Colonel Bowie surveyed the spot with delight.&#xD;
"What a fine place for a battle !" he exclaimed, turning to Captain Lorrimer.&#xD;
I was jest havin' such notions-pass through my heady" he replied.-&#xD;
'Therprairierising roundthe bottom land liky a high wall, would form a capi-&#xD;
tal breast-work for the men, and we could whip the blanketed fellers four to one&#xD;
without putting ourselves out a great deal, either. I wish there was somechance&#xD;
of their coming down upon us."&#xD;
" There's no doubt but they will, for they outnumHber u six to one," observed&#xD;
Harper.&#xD;
"How do you know. ?" asked the colonel.,&#xD;
" By the best kind of evidence, I take it-actual sight," said Noel Noon.&#xD;
"Explain," added Bowie.&#xD;
"Why, it is simply this ; Mr. Harper and I have been out scoutin' about a&#xD;
little, watchin' the movement qf, things. Bexar is literally swarrsin' with ene-&#xD;
mies.".&#xD;
" I'm glad to hear il for I feel anxious for some lind of a scrimmage."&#xD;
"I'll tell you how I think you can bring 'em ; jest build up one or tw4 large&#xD;
fires hereabouts, and they'll be likely t9 attract attention. Some of the women&#xD;
folks will come right down to trade with us, count us, and then carry back the&#xD;
news to the men, who don't relish ;a fight;with equal numbers, but are alwayson&#xD;

At about ten o'c1qck a half-breed came into camp,;bringing- the report-that&#xD;
the Mexicans had gone to attack General Burleson, who was encamped higher&#xD;
up the river. Thisiewswasdoubted byfthe-more knowing onesbut credited by&#xD;
the less experienced.'&#xD;
Bowie and Lorrimer allowed the men to lie down and sleep as usual.&#xD;
"'We'll warn you in time to make a defence, if the enemy should attempt a&#xD;
surprise," said the colonel. " I've seen some service, you know, andunderstand&#xD;
just about-what these'fellers mean. They're sly and need watching, but let 'em&#xD;
eatch me napping,.if4they can."&#xD;
Before eleven, the Hunters of the Border and Bowie's detachment were locked&#xD;
in the arms of sleep.' NQ etraordinixry vigilance about thp precincts of' the&#xD;
Horse Shoe indicated that any danger was apprehended, or that there was ,an&#xD;
enemy within a dozen miles.&#xD;
"This might look to some persons, like a want of discipline," Harper obser-&#xD;
ved to Noon ; but I presume the colonel knows what he is about ?"&#xD;
"You may depend on't be does. He'll scent the enemy if they come within&#xD;
rifle range, I'll warrant," said Noel.&#xD;
"ILook I there comes Dorville. Strange that he should follow us,"&#xD;
"He's-a queer genius--allers on hand when you don't expect him."&#xD;
"Is he a brave man, think you?"&#xD;
"That's what I can't say for certain ; but he doesn't appeal' likea person eas-&#xD;
fly frightened."&#xD;
The subject of this conversation approached.&#xD;
"Good evening;,lads--a fine camping ground is this-excellent spot for a neal&#xD;
little fight.. Placing ourselves behind this wall that the prairie has built round&#xD;
the bottom land, we can keep back any number'of the enemy," he remarked.&#xD;
"We have had the same thoughts," returned Noon.&#xD;
" Ah, here's Honest ! Mr. Harper what will you do with him, if there should&#xD;
be an engagement ?"&#xD;
"He'll-do very well ; he'll take care of himselff"&#xD;
"Whst is that upon his neck ?  Something that has a feminine look, certain.&#xD;
ly. Come here, Honest,.and let-me ,see,"'&#xD;
Honest looked:at hismaster's countenance and then walked up to Dorville.&#xD;
While the latter simply looked at the ribbon without touching it, the dog remain-&#xD;
ed passive and amicable, but the moment he placed his hand upon it, a growl. of&#xD;
displeasuw warned him to desist.&#xD;
"It is the gift of a fair damsel, no doubt, and he is in honor bound to keep it.&#xD;
here are theletters I. R..upon it. Presuniptuous dog ! Shall be jealous; you&#xD;
wear the colors of my own enchantress. .What do you suppose Manuel Hart&#xD;

"4Come, boys, lie down and get your rest," said Captain Lorrimer, who ap-&#xD;
proached at that moment. Rayther expect there'll be somethin' to do afor mor-&#xD;
nin', and you must be .fresh for askrimmage."&#xD;
"Honest and I will pass the night here," rejoined Harper, spreading his blan-&#xD;
ket upon the soft, grassy bottom-laid.&#xD;
" And I shall keep you company;"-said, Noon.&#xD;
The place our two friends had selected was on the right of the bend, and-about&#xD;
an hundred yards from the main body. of the detachment,&#xD;
Harper had just sunk ato sound sleep when he was awakened by Honest,&#xD;
who had scented the approach of some ooe.- Maurice arose =to his elbow, and&#xD;
saw, much to his surprise, Warpath approaching.  He motioned our hero to&#xD;
be silent as he drew nigh.&#xD;
"6Wake up, Open-hand," said the Lipan.&#xD;
Harper touched Noon 'ightly, andihe sprang to 'his feet..&#xD;
Open-hand, 'tis -he sileit. This way, follow-step softly-don't: wake&#xD;
the big moccasin snake I"&#xD;
Warpath leaped noiselessly from the bottom-land to the 'prairie,-and Harpe-&#xD;
and Noon did the same. The Lipan crouched until his tall figure was almost&#xD;
concealed by the grass, and his companions imitated his example. The red man.&#xD;
did not assume an erect position, until they had left the Horse Shoe several&#xD;
rods behind. He then approached 'the, river.  A  canoe was 'hidden'- in the&#xD;
bushesnear, the water.' The Lipan launched it, Maurice and Noon 'stepped in&#xD;
and then taking the paddle, Warpath propelled it dexterously across: the Sun&#xD;
Antonio. On the shore it was dragged up and hidden 'as before. : ' .&#xD;
The Indian took the direction of Bexar, and kept his' intentions to himself&#xD;
with strict fidelity to native character.' He paused snot far from the, town, and&#xD;
changed his mode of approach-going forward with much greater caution. Har-&#xD;
per and Noon imitated all his movementsuntil at last he made a full stop, and&#xD;
motioned them to cone and stand by his side. They obeyed his mute mandate,&#xD;
. and the Lipan-pointed with his finger.&#xD;
Following the direction of his hand, they perceived a large body of men hold-&#xD;
ing their horses by the bridles, ready to mount at a moment's warning.&#xD;
""Look to the right, white men," said the Lipan.&#xD;
They turned their eyes as indicated and beheld several pieces of artillery. The&#xD;
wheels of the carriages were covered with blankets, that they might roll softly,&#xD;
and the horses were already attached.&#xD;
"That means a surprise," said Harper.&#xD;
" When the moon reaches'that point in the skies where you see the dark cloud&#xD;
hovering like the bird of war. Their hearts are 'big wit courage, and their&#xD;
great guns are full of thunder. Let the white men beready."&#xD;

"Six to one," returned Warpath.&#xD;
" That's none too many," added Noon.'-&#xD;
"-Too many, if they find you sleeping," rejoined the Lipan, sarcastically.&#xD;
"Very true," said Maurice.&#xD;
" Have you looked enough ?" asked the chief.&#xD;
Yes," rejoined Noon.&#xD;
" Thena we'll go back," returned the Lipan.&#xD;
Warpath conducted the two youig nn 'to the Horse Shoe, in the same way&#xD;

before they had driven home a single ball, a discharge from Bowie's detachment&#xD;
stretched them beside their companions whom the first fire had slain.&#xD;
Again there was a terrible stampede to get out of the way, but many poor&#xD;
fellows finished their earthly warfare on the spot. Some of the Texans wished&#xD;
to follow up the advantage by pursuit, but th officers, more prudentansushed&#xD;

Various conjectures were now indulged in relation to another attack, but that&#xD;

dragging off the cannon.&#xD;
"Â«Now, my lads," cried Lorrimer, " prepare to serve them worse than before.&#xD;

obeyed; for all who are acquainted with the details of the battle of the Horse&#xD;

the Texan rifles. The guns were left without men to work them, and the aval-&#xD;

THE MAID oF THE RANCHE.&#xD;
CHAPTER XL&#xD;
THE AMBUSOADI .&#xD;
&#xD;
.Arma the battle the-detachments fell back upon General Burleson's position,&#xD;
-       who was intending to make an attack upon Bexar,-which was now in posses-&#xD;
sion of the Mexicans. to attack a town so well supplied with provisions, and&#xD;
containing so many of the enemy, was an undertaking of considerable nagni-&#xD;
tude, and likely to beattended with much bard fighting and _loss of life. Many&#xD;
of the houses in the town Were fortified, and even ehoud the Texans effect an&#xD;
entrance, they nmgbt' expect to receive -a-destructive fire from  the dwellings on&#xD;
1,0th sides of the  streets.-&#xD;
Several days were spent in consider the project,-and making arrangements&#xD;
for the enterprise. During the tite the Hunters of the Border were often in&#xD;
the saddle reconnoitering the adjacent country, and.skirmishing with parties of&#xD;
Mexicans,',&#xD;
while the subject of retaking Bexar was underconsideration, it must be re&#xD;
marled that Manuel Hart,.on account of. his wounded arm, was seldom on du-&#xD;
ty, and absent so frequently and so long, that :it was a: matter of observation&#xD;
among the men. florville also continued to be as eccentric as ever, sometimes&#xD;
disappearing for two days at a time, and then returning in a manner equallyas&#xD;
abrupt ,and unanticipated.&#xD;
One day 'after such an absence, he appeared and called Maurice aside wgh an&#xD;
anxious expression and a troubled brow.&#xD;
The news which he communicated was to our hero deeply interesting. He&#xD;
iaformed him that he had visited the Ranche, thnt the Rathburns had gone, and&#xD;
that he could gain no clue as to the place of their destination, or the. direction&#xD;
of their flight..                   .,A&#xD;
This intelligence affected him unpleasantly, for Iris Rathburn had seldom&#xD;
been long absent from his thoughts, since the period of his first meeting with&#xD;
her. He hastened to inform Noon of what he had heard, who shared largely in&#xD;
his anxiety,-it being well known that he was much interested in Ramona. Both&#xD;
of the young waen were just preparing to go out and reconnoitre the enemy,&#xD;
when this news was received, and with thoughtful faces they mounted their hor-&#xD;
ses and rode toward Bexar.Â°&#xD;
The mind of each wa' busy with the intelligence which Dorville had brought,&#xD;
anifor-a long time they went forward in silence. Noon was the first to speak&#xD;
in, regard to the subject uppermost in their ,thoughts.&#xD;
"I feel oncomfortable and disturbed about this business.  I can't see any&#xD;
good reason for Rathburn's leaving the Ranche in this strange way."&#xD;
Harper acknowledged that he had entertained similar sentiments in regard to&#xD;
the matter. Noel then, in his own blunt manner, demanded to know what was&#xD;
to be done, or if anything could or ought to be done in the premises.&#xD;
"If," replied Maurice, " all parties were agreed to the project of leaving their&#xD;
former place of residence, I cannot see that anything remains to be done; but&#xD;
if, on the contrary, there has been any compulsion or unfair dealing, that puts a&#xD;
new aspect upon the case. Do you suspect that anything wrong or compulsory&#xD;
has been going on ? If so, be frank."&#xD;
&#xD;
NE MAID OF THE RAITCHE.                      'I&#xD;
" I've called you my friend," returned Noon, " and I'll-be -free with yoit. You&#xD;
know, perhaps, that I think a great deal of Ramona; and used to visit the&#xD;
Railehe often. Well, I've seen enough first and last to make me suspect more&#xD;
than I feel disposed to mention. It's my opinion- the gals have been unjustly&#xD;
dealt with. I hate to say it, but it appears to me that MaineL Hart has more&#xD;
influe ce over Mr. Rathburn than he ought to have, and that the latter fears&#xD;
him, or isn't over and above honest himself.. The fact is," added Noel, emphat-&#xD;
ically, " there's bad influences at work there, and Rathburn needs to be watch-&#xD;
ed as close as Hart."&#xD;
"1My ofn thoughts precisely. I am glad you have spoken so freely," said&#xD;
Maurice.&#xD;
" It's time to speak and to act, too. No doubt but the young women are in&#xD;
trouble afore this time, and need somebody to look arter them andspeak a kind&#xD;
word.".e                                                        a&#xD;
"I am at your -service, Noel. You shall have my hearty co-operation in&#xD;
whatever you'may propose," responded Maurice, with earnestness,&#xD;
"I thank you," said the forester, warnly, " I thought you'd be willin' to lend&#xD;
a helping' hnnd, especially when such a female as Iris- mayneed assistance."&#xD;
By this time the"hunters had reached, a musquit growth not far from Bexar.&#xD;
Dismounting, they fastened their horses in the thicket and proceeded towards&#xD;
the town on foot, leaving Honest with the animals.&#xD;
As they walked cautiously on, they conversed more freelythan they had ever&#xD;
done before in relation to the two maidens and Manuel Hart. Noon did not&#xD;
hesitate to pronounce the latter a villain of the darkest character, although on&#xD;
that particular ,point he had hithertq' been quite .reserved. While talking in&#xD;
this amicable and confidential manner, hey reached. a spot in the vicinage of&#xD;
Slear where there was a light growth of post oakand ash. Here they paused.&#xD;
a moment to arrange their plan of operation more perfectly.&#xD;
They were conversing in suppressed voices, when certain sounds on their left&#xD;
made them aware that other parties were advancing. They immediately secret ,&#xD;
inasmuch as it transforms brethren of the same great family of man into deadly&#xD;
enemies..&#xD;
The intruders approached and proved to be two men, As the distance de-&#xD;
creased between them, it was plain that one was a Mexican officer, and the oth--&#xD;
er an American. They stopped within pistol shot and conversed earnestly.&#xD;
Though the features of neither were revealed perfectly at fist, the voice of one&#xD;
was sufficiently distinct to betray him to the listeners; both being assured that&#xD;
Manuel Hart was near them.&#xD;
With eagerness quite natural to the peculiar occasion, they awaited the de-&#xD;
noument of the singular interview. - All-that they said could not be heard and&#xD;
understood, but enough to give them an insight into the villain's schemes.r ae&#xD;
was.obviously tampering with the enemy, who was holding out to him a golden&#xD;
bait., His own treacherous disposition needed but aii inconsiderable incentive&#xD;
to make him a traitor, He was, to be brief, laying a plan with the Meican&#xD;
officer to betray his company and counttymenÂ° into the hands of those- who knew&#xD;
no mercy, and seldom gave quarter when victorious.&#xD;
About half-way from Burleson's position -to-Bexarthere was a long strip of&#xD;
timber, and a road traversing nearly its whole length. Into this wood the Hun-&#xD;
ters of the Border -were to beidecoyed'throxgh the instrumentality of Lieutenant&#xD;
Hart, where a large force of the enemy would belying in ambush, ready to greet-&#xD;
them with two six pounders, rifles, carbines, etc.&#xD;
With feelings of burning indignation, our two foresters listened to the details&#xD;
"f this wicked and cruelpot. &#xD;
"There are-two persons;" added Hart, in an earnest voice, when. the other mat-'&#xD;

terms had been 'thoroughly discussed,,"who mustn't Suriive the surprise, andl'I&#xD;
want that to be understood."              '&#xD;
The Mexican offcer inquired how he should know them. In answer to this&#xD;
query, the traitor described Harper and Noon minutely, not forgetting to men-&#xD;
tion the color of their horses.&#xD;
"I insist uponthis as condition of the agreement." To.an arrangement of&#xD;
this kind, of coume, the Mexican had no sort of objection, and was so sanguine&#xD;
of success, that he gave it as his opinion that not one of the company would es-&#xD;
cape. He admonished the villain to concoct the scheme for decoying them into&#xD;
the ambuscade with such ingenuity and certainty thatthere should be to fear of&#xD;
a failure. He then went on to speak of the facilities offered them by the length&#xD;
and density of the timber for secretingtheir forces, and pouring upon the advafic-&#xD;
ing and unsuspecting band such a conceptrated and continuous fire as should&#xD;
effectually cut them up and secure their utter defeat, if not their complete anni-&#xD;
hilation.&#xD;
The six pounders, loaded with chaintraces eat into pieces, were to be arran-&#xD;
ged so as to sweep the road, .and decimate both horse and rider.&#xD;
To avoid this general destruction, Hart was to invent some pretenee'for loiter-&#xD;
ing;behind' or"remaining at camp. The Texans were to be led into this fatal&#xD;
trap by a small-party of lancers who 'Were to approach Burleson's position by&#xD;
the timber road,-and then as soon as they had attracted-attention and encouraged&#xD;
pursuit, to retreat with all convenient haste toward the spot which was to be the&#xD;
scene of the surprise.&#xD;
This grand blow was to be struck without delay, and following day near dark&#xD;
was designated'as the time-for-its execution. These necessary andindispensable&#xD;
preliminaries having being duly arranged, the parties moved from the spot a few&#xD;
yards, and the subject appearedto be changed. The lieutenant expressed him-..&#xD;
self evidently quite freely and interestedly concerning a theme of a different na-&#xD;
ture. Their words could not be distinctly and connectedly heard,.but both Har-&#xD;
per and Noon Were certain that they heard Rathburn's name spoke several times.&#xD;
As the endversation progressed, theymanner, tone and gesticulation of the par-&#xD;
ties grew more earnest and impassioned,,and their voicee rising higher as they&#xD;
proceeded, the names of the maidens of the Ranche were pronounced so energeti-&#xD;
cally, the neither of our listeners could longer doubt the nature of the subject&#xD;
now being canvassed. Many conjectures, coupled with startling conceptions and&#xD;
and vague apprehensions concerning Iris and Ramona, disturbed the thoughts of&#xD;
the foresters. Queries like these arose to be solved : Why were., the names of&#xD;
the young women mentioned there, and under those circumstances,?  What&#xD;
common tie of interest existed between Hart and the Mexican officer relative to&#xD;
the maidens ?  Had the Mexican seen them?  If so, where, and when,'and&#xD;
what were his intentions concerning them:?&#xD;
The reader will bearing mind that it, was much more easy to.make mental in-&#xD;
terrogatories of this kind, than to give ananswer.to. one of them: It was very&#xD;
evident that the hititers had incontinently stuiibled upon a mystery which they&#xD;
wishedimuch to unravel and understand; ,but to do so, was.not a task to be ac-&#xD;
compilishedwithout diffieulty- Hairt would doubtless keep his own counsel, and&#xD;
the only feasible way of tracking him in the winding way of his villany, was to&#xD;
watch silently:and assiduously all his movements.&#xD;
Important discoveries have indeed beau made 'une pected revelations having&#xD;
a vita bearfng-upon the destinies of the Texa borderers, and also upon the:&#xD;
ARathbhugirls. Y'".&#xD;
Still conversing earnestly, Hart and his companion moved of arm in arm,&#xD;
to all appearance the best of friends.  Without speaking, Harper and Noon&#xD;
walked back to the spot- where they had left their horses.&#xD;
"What do you think of this, Mr.Noon ?"?'asked Maurice; in a suppressed&#xD;
tone, that he might better conceal the agitation of his own mind.&#xD;

"I1think, returned Noel, gazing quietly up in to the quiet skies, " I think&#xD;
tat a good providence has directed Our footsteps this night."&#xD;
Whtat we have just heard is deeply, suggestive of thought.  You recollect&#xD;
the subject of our conversation when'we left the camp?  Now will noti the&#xD;
strange conversation to which we have been a party, throw some light upon the&#xD;
mysterious disappearance of the Rathburns ?" rejoined Harper.&#xD;
"If it doesn't throw any particular light on that affair, it awakens many cn-&#xD;
pleasant suspicions, I reckon. ; To tell you th' truth, friend 'Maurice, I feel&#xD;
amazin' oncomfbrtable like., I th  k more of the fate 'of the gals, than I do&#xD;
about the ambuscade and surprise that is intended' for us tomorrowt night ; be-&#xD;
cause, you'see, we are 'forewarned- about the 'last, and if we can't outwit and&#xD;
circumvent them, we'd ought to be .ut into inch pieces by them ere oncommon&#xD;
swivels, loaded with mince trace:chains. If we don't make'that plot lose all its&#xD;
romance like, for them critter, 'it will be' or the reason' that there's no "such&#xD;
thing its Texan rifles and doubl4-sihts. That subject is all plain enough, and&#xD;
don't require no great: amount, of ,agebra tactics and that sort of larnin' to work&#xD;
it out ; hut about the Rathburns we'recornpletel nonplussed; and don't know&#xD;
inothiui for sartain only that some specie of devil ry is on foot."&#xD;
Discussing this absorbingly interesting topic, Tarper and Noon rode into&#xD;
camp and hastened to communicate with CaptainI torrimer. The plan of the&#xD;
ambuscade was'developed, but failed to produce those indications of astonish-&#xD;
ment which they naturally expected to see-exhibited.&#xD;
"I rayther thought 'twould, come to this," he said, musingly. "There was&#xD;
allers a twinkle in the va'mint's eye that I couldn't exactly overlook.' 'I knew&#xD;
he was a coward, and it don't take much to make a cowa'd a traitor. But he's&#xD;
in a fair way to be fetched up with a sudden jerk. I'll see that he's properly&#xD;
taken care of ; and so soon as we have outwitted' this idea of an ambuscade,&#xD;
and punished the rascals for their presumption, Manuel Hart shall swing, if&#xD;
there's halters enough in camp to hang him I I can get along with a mocason&#xD;
snake, a savage, or any kind of a heathen cretur, but a black-hearted traitor 1"&#xD;
Immediately there wa's a private consultation among tle officers, and orders&#xD;
were at once issued to meet the emergencies of the coming day. Twe detach-&#xD;
ments of riflemen were marched to the timber, to take a position inthe rear of&#xD;
that determined on by the enemyon either side of the road, where they were to&#xD;
lie perdu during the day. To the head of the timber toward Bexar, three field&#xD;
pieces were dragged and stationed, ready for use. Besides these, and men to&#xD;
work them, was a company of riflemen. Both horses and men found ample means&#xD;
of concealment at a distance of some two hundred yards from the road,. in a cy-&#xD;
press growth, between which and the town was a'dense, impenetrable chapparal.&#xD;
To'keep the animals quiet, they were fed plentifully with corn and newly cut&#xD;
grass. During these rapid movements and preparations, the return of Manuel&#xD;
Hart to camp was impatiently awaited. The detachments had, marched before&#xD;
he appeared. As he walked toward his tent, he was arrested by a corporal and&#xD;
a file of men. The traitor's self possession well nigh forsook him. Taken wholly&#xD;
by surprise, and conscious of his guilt, he was unprepared to make"any defence,&#xD;
or to put so good a face upon the matter, had such a turn in affairs been antici-&#xD;
.pated. He felt that in some inexplicable way his villany had been unmasked;&#xD;
and he was aware, furthermore; that the punishment of traitors was prompt and&#xD;
sunimary. ' The fear of death struck a mortal terror to his heart. Visions of a&#xD;
drum-head court martial, a short trial, prompt sentence, and speedy execution&#xD;
of the same, went' whirling through his brain,'making it'faint and dizzy. How&#xD;
suddenwas the downfall of his expectations I how irremediable the ruin that&#xD;
looked 'him in the face I The avenues of escape seemed closed up. No enliv-&#xD;
ening hope gleamed in upon him to render the future less gloomy.&#xD;

questioned the"guarlrelative to the causes that led to his arrest ; but having&#xD;
been strictly charged to hold no conversation with the prisoner, they made no&#xD;
reply this ,iterrogatories, and so he was obliged to remain in total ignorance&#xD;
,   guard to the precise nature of the charges to be made against him, and the&#xD;
evidence that could be adduced. In this uncomfortable State of uncertainty, he&#xD;
was obliged to remain, until it should suit the pleasure and convenience of those&#xD;
who had caused his arrest, to explain matters in a formal way.&#xD;
The day which was anticipated by the Texans as big with events, dawned&#xD;
upon then bright and clear; but before noon the weather changed, and the&#xD;
sky became overcast and cloudy. The hours crept on at a snail's pace to the&#xD;
impatientsenses. of the Texams, and the approach of night was hailed with .plea-&#xD;
sure by-the riflemen lying in wait, the company in the -chapparal, which with&#xD;
slipped bridles, awaited the proper moment, and to the Hunters of the Border&#xD;
at camp; who were ready to spring into their saddles at the first appearance of&#xD;
the decoy party of Mexican lancers.&#xD;
Harper andNoon were in the, foremost rank, quite fearless of the coming&#xD;
contest, and the masked battery of the enemy.' Captain Lorrimer stood beside&#xD;
a large grey horse, wearing not only the accustomed side arms of an officer, but&#xD;
grasping in his right hand his Iong and deadly rifle, 1His usually quiet and&#xD;
placid features were now stern ani threatening, and his whole frame stimulated&#xD;
and nerved to deeds of patriotic daring. g      .a&#xD;
The expression of Harper had also undergone a signal change. The ardor&#xD;
and courage inspired in the youthful breast by the near prospect of justifiable&#xD;
warfare, and honorable distinction won by undaunted bravery, imparted to his&#xD;
bearing more dignity. pride and firmness, than he had yet exhibited.&#xD;
The Hunters of the Border, in this case, had voluntarily taken the post of&#xD;
danger. They were well aware that, if their plans did not operate precisely ac-&#xD;
cording to preconcerted measures, and they were. drawn fully into the ambus-&#xD;
cade, a destructive fire must sweep and decimate their ranks. But this was one&#xD;
of the emergencies of war, from which a true soldier would not shrink.&#xD;
Honest care and licked his master's hand, as if asking permission to attend&#xD;
him;but patting him softly upon the head, Harper ordered him to remain be-&#xD;
hind, and ,ip trotted off' towards the tents with a low whine of disappointment,&#xD;
occasionally stopping to look back wistfully and-deprecatingly at the author of&#xD;
this unwelcome 'mandate.&#xD;
Dorville,dwhom Maurice had not seen since the previous -night, now dashed&#xD;
up to his side, mounted upon a powerful black horse.&#xD;
onTha'sloks like a sortie," he said, " and luckily I am in time to go withs&#xD;
you.  What's on foot ?", .&#xD;
Harper explained to him in a few words the cause of these demonstrations.&#xD;
" Last night he evaded me, or I should have made this discovery myself.1&#xD;
knew that te was tampering with the enemy; and had had several interviews&#xD;
with a Mexican officers. I followed him as far as the timber, where I unfortu-&#xD;
nately lost track  f him in the darkness ; but possibly I have made some dis-&#xD;
coveries which will indemnify me, in some sort, for the failure. A strong party&#xD;
of Moderators are'hovering-about the camp. What tho&#xD;
S    vmore  y fully acudevelope"  teihkobjectis,remaion ctk&#xD;
" Have you actually- seen them?" asked s'oil; Noon, quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MAID OF THE RANvH&#xD;
&#xD;
rrf&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes ; I was within sight of their camp-fires'last night ;  ar enough to in-&#xD;
nale the odor of the venison which was cooking for their supper. I think I saw&#xD;
Itathburn "among them."&#xD;
" Rathburn !" exclaimed Noon, with a %tart.&#xD;
"I fancied so, but I was not near enough to be wholly certain on that point ;&#xD;
but providing I rm right in my suspicions, what think you does it augur ?"&#xD;
Before Harpef or Noel had time to framC an answer to this question, a party&#xD;
of Mexicans, with red streamers floating from the points of their lances, came&#xD;
dashing towards them from the timber. They drew up, however, before they&#xD;
came within rifle range, and turned their horses' heads for a scamper in the op-&#xD;
osite direction.&#xD;
Lorrimer gave the word to mount, and in an instant the entire company was&#xD;
thundering after the decoy lancers. On rattled the latter, congratulatingAthem-&#xD;
selves on the perfect success, thus far, of their stratagem,&#xD;
They entered the timber at a gallop, purshef by the powerful' Texan horses,&#xD;
whose weight and metal made the groundshake-to their tread.&#xD;
Possibly as the Hunters of the Border'urged their fiery steeds towards the&#xD;
teeth ,of the concealed foe, they might have confessed a quickened beating of&#xD;
the heart, and-sensations of unpleasant expectation, but there was no place in&#xD;
their determined souls for fear.&#xD;
The lancers, with their waving pennons and gay colors, swept On through and&#xD;
past the ambuscade,.and the Texars at full speed reached the spot that was in,&#xD;
tended to be the last scene in the changing drama-of life.&#xD;
While the heavy tramp of the borderers shook the-timber, a deafening rattle&#xD;
of small arms saluted their ears, and'a terrible shower of lead went whistling&#xD;
overand among them, emptying some saddles, and wounding many of those res-&#xD;
olute inen. This discharge was instantly followed by the Texan war-cry on&#xD;
either side, and the sharp, decisive and continuous crack of the Texan rifle.&#xD;
Spurring on out of the dangerous vicinage, the stunning roar of cannon made&#xD;
the woods give back deeper and mightier reverberations, and the lancers were&#xD;
suddenly checked, thrown back and scattered as though a tremendous billow of&#xD;
fire and flame had unexpectedly rolled up against and over helmed them.&#xD;
The mounted riflemen had charged and taken the two *s-poundez, and turn-&#xD;
ed their muzzles upon the decoy-party, literally cutting them in pieces. Horses&#xD;
and riders fell together in a bleeding and mangled mass.&#xD;
The dismayed and horror-stricken survivors sprang from their saddles, and&#xD;
rushed into the timber for shelter, there; perhaps, to meet the unerring aim of&#xD;
the Texan rangers. The timber was now full of the tumult and dissonance of&#xD;
battle. The ambushed foemen, attacked furiously in the rear, were driven into&#xD;
the road, and the Hunters of the Border, turning, charged upon them like a&#xD;
thunderbolt, scattering them as the fierce winds scatter autumn leaves.&#xD;
The other company of riflemen, at that crises now appeared in sight from the&#xD;
Bexar side, with the field-pieces, ready to open upon them, ahou!d they attempt&#xD;
to retreat to the town. But completely broken, disheartened and astounded,:they&#xD;
threw down their arms and begged for quarter, which was cheerfullygivem.&#xD;
If the men had not been tired with their day's vigil in the woods, they would&#xD;
have advanced upon Bexar ; but it was considered best by lose in command to&#xD;
defer the'attack, and the Texans marched back to camp, cal ryingquite a nuns&#xD;
ber of prisoners, and in high spirits&#xD;

THE MAID OF THE RANCRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIHI.&#xD;
TH COURT *RIArL, VISIT TO THE RANCH.&#xD;
THE treaehery of Manuel Hart produced considerable excitement-among Lorri-&#xD;
ier's men. Some of them could scarcely believe that he had really intended to&#xD;
seltthem t4 the enemy, and were somewhat !lisposed to entertain the idea that&#xD;
Harper, disappointed by :ot being chosen to lead them, had, concocted some in-&#xD;
genious scheme to ruinhis successful rival. %t such feelings and suspicon were&#xD;
by no means prevalent or popular, the majority plainly seeing his guilt.&#xD;
Upon thefollowing day a court-martial was called, consisting of General Bur-&#xD;
leson, Colonel.Bowie, Captain Lorrimer and other officers.&#xD;
Hartstrenuously deniedall.the -charges adduced against him,even when Noon&#xD;
and Harper testified to what they had heard. But the evidence was overwhel-&#xD;
ming; for the battle of the previous night, the disposition of the enemy, the ap-&#xD;
pearance of the decoy party, and in fact, everything that transpired at the time,&#xD;
confirmed the testimony of. Noon and Hprper.&#xD;
Dorville deposed and said,:that he had followed him to the precincts of Bexar,&#xD;
three nights ago, where he (J art) :had been met bya Mexican officer, and the&#xD;
two entered, a house on the outskirts of the town, where they remained for a long&#xD;
time. .e did not deem it prudent to go near enough to the house to listen, but&#xD;
when they came out, he heard them make an appointment to-meet the next eve-&#xD;
ning in the growth of, post oak,,where the other witnesses had testified to seeing&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Dorville a lsQ gave other evidence.of a circumstantial kind, which went against&#xD;
the accused,  art asked for time that he might bring rebutting testimony. He&#xD;
said that he could prgev an alibi, and only wanted to get word to certain persons&#xD;
in whose compny head passed the first part of the night&#xD;
No doubt as to his guilt remained, but the court, willing to show all the fair-&#xD;
ness and clemency that was possible, gave him three days' grace, with the offer&#xD;
of sending a trusty messenger to any place he night designate, to bring' in his&#xD;
witness to prove an alibi.&#xD;
This was a concession which Hart in reality did not expect, and he embraced&#xD;
the conditions gladly, and a hope of escape wholly unknown tohis judges, sprang&#xD;
up in his breast.&#xD;
With a part.of the appalling load shaken from his mind, he was re-conducted&#xD;
to his place of confinement.&#xD;
Noe Noon, having obtainedpermission to do so, visited ths prisoner, to gain,&#xD;
if possible, some information of him concerning the Rathburn family; but he&#xD;
could get no satisfactory answers. He was more confirmed, however, in his&#xD;
previ p opinion-thst Jart had some knowledge of their present residence ;&#xD;
and he did not even attempt to deny that such. was the fact.  He refused to&#xD;
hold any combmunication with him, in reference to the maidens, without a prom-&#xD;
ise from Noel, that he would assist him to escape.&#xD;
"1Providing," he said," that he (Noon) would exert himself strenuously to pro-&#xD;
cure 13 liberation, he would impart to him all the information which he had re.&#xD;
rating to the maidens."&#xD;
*       But a promise of this kind the honest forester did not feel that he could hon&#xD;
orably make ; consequently, the traitor's conditions were rejected.&#xD;

THE MAID oTHE RANCHE&#xD;
&#xD;
'WARPrATH' AND HIS VICTIM.&#xD;
Having failed to make any discoveries in that direction, Noon and Harper&#xD;
resolved to visit the Ranche on the Brazos, and endeavor, by all feasible meth-&#xD;
ods, to gain some clue to the sudden flitting of the Rathburns.&#xD;
Their journey to that'locality it will not be necessaryto followstep by step ;&#xD;
but suffice it to say, that they reached the spot near the close of the second day.&#xD;
Everything:looked natural about the premises. There had been no change in&#xD;
the externgl4sof the place. Some sheep and cattle were feeding, as was their&#xD;
wont on the prairie on the east side of the coral' ;nd'it was evident that the&#xD;
spot' had not been visited by enemies, for in that da6e, the flocks and Aerds&#xD;
would have been driven off.&#xD;
D mounting, they turned theirs horses loose, of which liberty the jaded animals&#xD;
were glad to avail themselves. The gate of the corral was' fastened, but Noel&#xD;
being acquainted with those natters, soon contrived to open it. The door of the&#xD;

THE MAID OF\ THE RANCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
house was secured in a similar manner, but that difficulty was overcome as readi*&#xD;
ly as the other. They entered, but all within was silent and gloomy. The cheer.&#xD;
fulness of the place had departed. The graceful forms and pleasant voices of the&#xD;
maidens were not there to make it home-like and agreeable.&#xD;
Both the youngufen sat dowi with feelings of sadness. Noon looked doubly&#xD;
disconsolate, and his eyes wandered restlessy about the room, as if he expected&#xD;
to see the tidy figuie'of Ramona starting up from some obscure corner.&#xD;
" I can't think of staying' here all night," he said,i despoudingly; "for it isn't&#xD;
the place thabitiused to be, by no means. L.et's go to pur old campin' ground,&#xD;
above here."'&#xD;
To this proposition Maurice was very' willing to consent; for the dwelling ap-&#xD;
peared so utterly deserted, that he.seriously doubted whether he could sleep theit.&#xD;
While they were passing from the corral, something white upon the ground,&#xD;
near the gate, attracted our hero's attention. He picked it up. It proved to&#xD;
be a linen handkerchief, to which was.pinned a slip of paper, containing the fol.&#xD;
lowing lines:&#xD;
"wMy fthe has su  nly resolved to leave the Ranche, and will give no reason.&#xD;
for this unanticipated determination. Manuel Hart has been seen in this vicinity,&#xD;
within a few hours. I fear that father has been unduly influenced, and is in some&#xD;
way inthe power of this man. 'This mysterious movement fills Ramona and my-&#xD;
self with alarm. We tremble with fear, and yet we know not why. I would&#xD;
write whither we are going, but do not know.Ims-"&#xD;
"P. S., Since writing the above, I have seen a Mexican officer with my fath-&#xD;
er. They crossed the Ranche together, unconscious that they were observed by&#xD;
Ramona'or myself. Perhaps we are to be conveyed to some place in possession&#xD;
of the Mexicans. Why I pen these lines I scarcely know ; and I do so without&#xD;
any other than a vague idea that they may in some manner -be of use to us.&#xD;
harper read this note aloud, and although it contained nothing definite in re-&#xD;
gard to;the destination of the maidens, yet it seemed to revive the hopes of the&#xD;
foresters. The' probability was now pretty strong that they had been taken to&#xD;
some town where the Mexicans were in possession, and Bexar might be that&#xD;
place.&#xD;
The more Harper and Noon reflected upon the subject, the ,more they were&#xD;
inclined to this opinion. Earnestly talking the matter over, they reached their&#xD;
old camping ground, and-proceeded without delay to kindle a fire and cook some&#xD;
venison which they had brought with them.&#xD;
Having answered the demandswofappetite, they wrapped themselves in their&#xD;
blankets and were soon lost in profound slumber, while Honest, as weary as they,&#xD;
stretched himself beside them and slept as soundly,&#xD;
The sun had mounted high in the heavens when the foresters awoke. Noon,&#xD;
who had been suffering from a severe cold, had increased the difficulty by expo-&#xD;
sure and the morning found him quite feverish ; so much so, that Harper recom-&#xD;
mended him to remain quietwhile he went out in search of such' game as would&#xD;
be best for him, under the circumstances.&#xD;
He succeeded in procuring afew grouse.and was on the way back, when he&#xD;
sawa figure walking among the .trees beyond him.  Curious 'to know who it&#xD;
might be,,he hurried on in thpt direction, hoping to get a bitter view of the&#xD;
erson wheeer ilt nigbt be. fait: the lguru was ,no longer in sight, and. think.&#xD;
ig .he.w  entirely fied in.his intention, he abandoned the thought and seated&#xD;
himsdlf .eside a cool spring to rest. He had sat there but a few minutes, when&#xD;
the man appeared in full view advancing towards him, .evidently unconscious&#xD;
thatisravements were observed.&#xD;
,-arper recognized him at once as Meltiah Moss.&#xD;
This way-this way, Meltiah i Inhave news for you," sa~d Maurice, ad-&#xD;
dressing him, 11Your friend H'art is in trouble "&#xD;
&#xD;
The latter stopped and surveyed our hero with an expression of genuine aston-&#xD;
ishment, not unmixed with fear.&#xD;
"1Sorry to hear it, stranger. What's the natur of the trouble ?" replied Mos,&#xD;
when he bad recovered a measure of his self-possession.&#xD;
Maurice told him what had happened, which intelligence did not seem to. af-&#xD;
feet' him greatly.g&#xD;
"I s'pose bygones is bygones, And you don't hold no hardness ?" said Moss,&#xD;
"I shall not remember your evil designs to your injury, providing yon do not&#xD;
give me-fresh occasion to complain, in which.event I will not be answerable for&#xD;
what I may do."&#xD;
Harper then proceeded to question Meltiah in regard to the flight of the&#xD;
Rathburns, but could elicit nothing of any importance. Moss was entirely ig-&#xD;
norant, or' feigned to be, of the whole matter; only knowing that they went&#xD;
down the river very suddenly..y&#xD;
"I've been thinkin'," said Moss, as Harper waD preparing to go, "that my&#xD;
life hasn't been jest what it ought to have been. I have made up my mind to&#xD;
reform:"y&#xD;
"The experiment is worth trying.  You will' feel better for it, no doubt;&#xD;
although, truth to tell, I have the smallest possible faith in'your promises," re-&#xD;
joined Maurice.&#xD;
" Just the state of things I expected,; but havin' been pretty sick lately from&#xD;
a wound which you gave me at the Ranche, I have had time to reflect on my con-&#xD;
duct, and see that it hasn't quite come up to what a humane critter onght to be.&#xD;
I've been set on by others to injure you, and to balance the account, if the time&#xD;
ever comes when I can lend you a helpin' hand, I'll do iti'c&#xD;
" Perhaps it wont be best to discuss the matter much," replied Harper, with&#xD;
an incredulous smile, " for youdoubtless remember that we have met several&#xD;
times before, and not under circumstances to enhance my opinion of you. If&#xD;
there is anyopening through which you can escape from the pollutions of your&#xD;
past life, I certainlyhope that you may avail yourself of it; but if you don't&#xD;
wish to make me mistrust that you design to waylay me before I get back to&#xD;
camp, let the subject drop."&#xD;
Harper gathered up his game and moved on. At -the distance of a hundred&#xD;
yards,. he turned and looked hack. 'Moss was leaning on his rifle, gazing fixedly&#xD;
after him.' Maurice wondered whit he might be thinking about at that particu-&#xD;
lar moment, or what new piece of mischief he was maturing.&#xD;
When our young soldier reached the camp, h oel declared that he felt better&#xD;
a   after partaking of some of the "broth which Harper prepared for him, was&#xD;
anxious to turn his face once more in the direction of Bexar. Accordingly the&#xD;
horses were caught, and they left the Ranche, though not without sadness and&#xD;
regret.&#xD;
They had proceeded about ten miles, when Noon becameunable to go farther&#xD;
They were in the heart of the forest, and not a human habitation was near. The&#xD;
forester did not complain, but a glance at his flushed face was enough to convince&#xD;
Maurice that he was very i 1$. What was now to be ddne? Promptaction was&#xD;
certainly demanded. Seating Noel upon a log, Harper with the point of his&#xD;
pocket knife opened a vein, and having taken as much blood as he considered ju-&#xD;
dicious 'closed it up in aquick and masterly mauner. Telling him to  remain&#xD;
where he was, our hero thenwent in search of a camp which he recollected to bave&#xD;
seen in that vicinity some months before.&#xD;
He was fortunate enough to find it, and Noon was conducted to it. It stood&#xD;
close by the river, and hunters and settlers frequently made it a stopping place&#xD;
Here they remained during that day and the next, waiting for a favorable change&#xD;
i the disease. The sick man was impatient of this delay to the last degree, ane&#xD;
Maurice had great difficulty in keeping him quiet. But their detention was ind&#xD;

demnified by finding between the crevices of the logs of which the camp -was built&#xD;
a small piece of paper, with the following lines traced upon'it, evidently by Iris,&#xD;
but without signature.u&#xD;
" We have come thus far on horseback.  We have stopped here to rest, for&#xD;
this kind of exercise fatigues us exceedingly. We are still ignorant of our place&#xD;
of destination. Father is stern snd.silent, and sometimes harsh. Our minds are&#xD;
full of anxious for ebodings. This note may possibly meet the eyes of Noel Noon,&#xD;
or some person interested in us."&#xD;
This-note had much to do with increasing the restlessness of Noon.&#xD;
On the third day of their detention, while Maurice was hunting, he saw a man&#xD;
crossing the river in a-dug-out. Although a considerable distance from him, he&#xD;
imagined that he had seen the same before. Full of this thought he walked down&#xD;
the river, concealing his person from view by keeliing among the trees, with the&#xD;
intention of -getting a nearer and better view of the individual who had excited&#xD;
his curiosity.&#xD;
Unfortunately there was an abrupt bend in the river between him and the man&#xD;
in the dug-out, and before he had gone round it, the object of his scrutiny had&#xD;
crossed and disappeared. Going down to the water's edge, he discovered the&#xD;
dug-out drawn up into the bushes. Examining it closely, he perceived that an-&#xD;
fle ball had passed through one side, splintering it considerably. Instantly he&#xD;
recollected the incident that had transpired on his first meeting with Manuel Hart ;&#xD;
viz, the unlucky shot, and the consequent bravado of the back-woodsman.&#xD;
If the latter had not been 'left under arrest at General Burleson's camp, he&#xD;
would not have hesitated to say that he had just seen him crossing the Brazos.&#xD;
But the facts in the case were very much against this'supposition ; for he doubt-&#xD;
ed not .that Hart had expiated his villanies in a terrible manner. He knew&#xD;
the sentiments of the officers in regard to his.guilt, and not one of them believed&#xD;
that an alibi could be proved, relative to his last interview with the Mexican of-&#xD;
ficer,-where the traitorous plot had been fully developed.- : It was proved that he&#xD;
had been there, as specified by two witnesses, and how could it be shown by any&#xD;
amount of rebutting testimony, that he was in another locality and otherwise en-&#xD;
gaged ?&#xD;
Harper pursued his way to the camp, deeply cogitating the subject. The sun&#xD;
was just going down, and the shadows of twilight were silently invading the for-&#xD;
est. ' Our hero was but a short distance from camp, when Meltiah Moss sudden-&#xD;
ly glided from behind a tree, and stood before him, holding up his finger tad-&#xD;
monish him to cautions utterance. .&#xD;
" You have doubted my perfessions about tryin' to do better and reform like,&#xD;
but I've come now to prove that I'm raaly in airnest. The Moderators got word&#xD;
that Manuel Hart was in difficulty, hovered about Burleson's camp like greedy&#xD;
kites, attacked the guard one night, killed several of 'em, and-carried the traitor&#xD;
in triumph.' He and a score of blackguards are now in the neighborhood arter&#xD;
you and Noel Noon. If you aint off afore mornin','you'll be dead men."&#xD;
" Can all this be true, Moss ?" asked harper, looking searchingly at Meltiah.&#xD;
" True as preachin', and more so ; because I don't believe all preachin's true&#xD;
rhis isn't quite all, neither, Jack Lawleess, the chap as :calls hinrself the.Texan&#xD;
cub, is' with him; as full of wickedness as ever a critter was. ' If ydu aint out of&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
HOW' MANUEnL's PLOT SUCCEEDED.&#xD;
FOR a time Harper remained silent, reflecting upon the strange communication&#xD;
which had been made. The degree of importance to be attached to what Moss&#xD;
*     had'affirmed, was something not easily-determined ; for, hitherto that personage&#xD;
bad  proved a most unconscionable rogue. But now his manner appeared, much&#xD;
changed ; the express ion of his countenance was not so sinister, and his voice was&#xD;
more earnest and. me 'ming.&#xD;
"You speak advisedly in this matter, I trust," he said, resolving to testhim, so&#xD;
far as he was able tollo so.&#xD;
" I have told you jestthe truth and no more; but I don'pmuch expect to make&#xD;
you believe it, because, as my repution for veracity isn't oncommon, I rayther&#xD;
expect that I have kept the company of Jack Lawless.and sichkind of specim-&#xD;
entsof human natur.so long, that I've larnt many things not necessary to my&#xD;
well bein'," responded Meltiah.&#xD;
"There's no question about it in my- mind," replied Maurice, with a smile;&#xD;
"but," he added i mediately, in a serious tone, " if the marvellous tale that you&#xD;
have been telling me be strictly true,: what,copree aru I to'pursue?"&#xD;
" That's the very thing to be decided. I think if I was in your shoes, I should&#xD;
shoulder my shooting' stick and cut like a streak !  I generally finds that there's&#xD;
nothing' scarcely, like a man's legs, when he's in difficplty. , Thway 'tis with mne&#xD;
when I see anythin' like danger inthe distance, I take to ny taps kinder nater-&#xD;
ally, and leave it:at a two forty gait. But as you are now situated, that doesn't&#xD;
appear to be altogether easy ; for without the practice of unusual caution, you'll&#xD;
have Hart and his wolverines'on your trail; and unless you're -oncommon smart,&#xD;
they'll 'run you down for sartain, when you'll be worked off 'without the benefit&#xD;
of court-martial, or.three days' grace. If you stay where you are, you'll have to&#xD;
bear a pretty hard siege, and I don't see bow you're going' to do that, geeim there's&#xD;
only two.of you, and one sick in the bargain."&#xD;
-  "To allhuman appearance our chance to escapewill be small, if we adopt the&#xD;
latter course ; and yet I do not know how to act otherwise, because Noon isn't&#xD;
able to bear the fatigue of rapid travelling, at present."&#xD;
"I know it's a kind of hard case, but J don't see no way of helpia' it. I've&#xD;
done what I thought was right, and you can take what course you like the&#xD;
best."&#xD;
Meltiah Moss said no more, but shouldering his rifle, stalked away, leavipg our&#xD;
hero in a sublime state of doubt, and uncertainty, He reached the, camp in a&#xD;
condition of unpleasant,apxiety,.audbe had no definite means of rendering his&#xD;
perplexities less harassing. Noon, was worse. than he had been hitherto,?and&#xD;
Harper at first-questioned the propriety of-telling him what he had heard; more&#xD;
mature reflection however, inducedhim Ao lay the matter before his friend, who&#xD;
listened attentively, and expressed ,his opinion to: the effect that. therewas, a,&#xD;
strong probability of the wholebeing strict true; thathart was.a  arg&#xD;
ing obtained his liberty through the instrumentality of a party of Moderator : ---"&#xD;
the same doubtless spoken ofiby Dorvillerasld,s~timulated, by a desire for r~-&#xD;

THE MAID OF THE- RANCHE.&#xD;
&#xD;
genge is paramount with bad men. Hart had objects to gain, and putting&#xD;
them both out of existence, he doubtless considered it an important step in the&#xD;
consummation of his designs. They therefore might expect the worst, and the&#xD;
probability of falling into the hands of the traitor was indeed too strong not to&#xD;
excite real apprehensions.&#xD;
The Moderators, many of them, were men aggregated from the floating popu-&#xD;
lation of Texas, fugitives from justice from other states, persons without moral&#xD;
principle, with few ties to bind them to any place, and with no visible means of&#xD;
gaining a livelihood. Therefore, an easy, vagrant life accorded best with their&#xD;
dispositions and previous habits. 'What are esteemed crimes among the healthy&#xD;
portions of community,.were by them deemed matters so common-place, as to be&#xD;
of very little, or of no'importance.&#xD;
To fight, the Regulators whenever opportunity offered, to appropriate any'&#xD;
horses, which they might find, to their own use; or any other available property,&#xD;
formed distinguishing traits in their characters. Not that all who belonged to&#xD;
this restless faction were men destitute of honesty, and sold to the commission or,&#xD;
crime, but there were too many of that stamp mixed up with it, to makeit an&#xD;
agency of good to the country. The more peace-loving, quiet and conservative&#xD;
members of this organisation stayed at home, minding their bwn affairs; and it&#xD;
was only such-as we have described, who moved about in'predatory bands, for&#xD;
the purposes named.                                              ' .&#xD;
Noon proposed leaving the place as speedily as possible ; having good&#xD;
horses, he believed they might be able to leave. Hart and his fellows be-&#xD;
hind.&#xD;
Harper thereupon reminded him of his illness, which in the excitement of the,&#xD;
moment he'had almost forgotten. Noel's countenance instantly lost its hopeful&#xD;
expression, and he acknowledged that to stay where they were appeared to be&#xD;
the alternative, although twenty to two were fearful odds..-&#xD;
Having decided relative to this point,- Harper set about putting the camp in&#xD;
as good, a state .f defence as possible. He prepared barricades to fasten the&#xD;
door, made loop' holes in various places, and put their pistols and rifles in&#xD;
proper order. Noel assisted him .in this as much as his feeble condition would&#xD;
admit.,&#xD;
Until midnight they awaited the approach of'theirexpected enemies with not&#xD;
a little anxiety, when they relaxed their vigilance, somewhat inclined to believe&#xD;
that the alarm had been entirely without foundation. Maurice persuaded the&#xD;
forester to lie down and attempt to get the rest which'he needed ;, and, while&#xD;
giving him a simple decoction of herbs'which he had prepared, both were start-&#xD;
led by a gentle knocking at the 'door. Instantly the hunters caught their&#xD;
weapons.&#xD;
"Who knocks ?" demanded Harper.&#xD;
"Meltiah Moss," responded a voice without.&#xD;
" Are you-alone ?"&#xD;
Moss replied that he was, and if Harper had any doubt of it, he could look&#xD;
out and satisfy'himself.  -&#xD;
Our hero opened the door and Meltiah entered.&#xD;
" Why do you dome, and what news do you bring ?n&#xD;
"I come because two and one make three ; and in a case like this, three might&#xD;
be a great deal better than two. i don't greatly like to--fight in the open: air,&#xD;
because I allers likes somethin' atween *ie and t  enemy; and these logs have&#xD;
the appearance of being' bullet proof. If Hart and-his fellers should come up,&#xD;
you needn't say pertickerler that I'm here, because it might work agin me artery&#xD;
wards. If we should have to knot under I've got some hand-culls in my&#xD;
pockets which I Can jest slip on to mf wrists, and'make 'em think I'm here agin-&#xD;
my will, 'and a prisoner.".&#xD;
&#xD;
Neither Noon nor Maurice could help smiling at the ingenuity displayed by&#xD;
their new ally, who seemed resolved to secure his personal safety in all cases&#xD;
where it was possible.&#xD;
"1I haven't told you the news, yet," resumed Moss. " I've seen Warpath, and&#xD;
you may expgt him afore mornin', with several of his heathen critters' as he&#xD;
calls warriors. If it hadn't been for that expectation, I raaly don't think you'd&#xD;
have seen Meltiah Moss in this here establishment ; because as I've a constitu-&#xD;
tional weakness which allers make me ine the strongest party. I s'pose, how-&#xD;
somever, it's something' a kind providence has gifted me with, to keep me out; of&#xD;
danger ; and notwithstandin' I've got that blessing' so abundantly, I paint sinfully&#xD;
proud of it, by no means, because everybody has some distinguishin' virtue that&#xD;
shines brighter than others."&#xD;
This time Meltiah Moss was indeed the herald of cheering news, although&#xD;
neither of the foresters were yet disposed to rely implicitly upon his assever-&#xD;
ations.&#xD;
This conversation had scarcely ceased, whenNoon descried a man approach-&#xD;
ing the camp from the river. The parties watched his coming with much inter-&#xD;
est. He announced his 'arrival by .a peremptory knocking, The foresters al-&#xD;
lowed him to repeat this demonstration several times before giving any mdi-&#xD;
dication that he was heard ; and then Harper demanded the business of the&#xD;
intruder.&#xD;
".I've come to see if thar war anybody here. Thar 's a feller critter down below&#xD;
that's shakin' his clothes off'from him with the fever and ager."&#xD;
"I regret to heads it," replied Maurice. "'Better give him some quinine."&#xD;
" Must give him   something , I reckon, stranger, or he'll shake himself&#xD;
into futurity almost directly. Want to get,you to go down and help bring&#xD;
him in."&#xD;
"That's humbug stuff!" muttered Moss, in an under tone.&#xD;
"Take him on your shoulder and bang him right along," returned&#xD;
Noon.&#xD;
" Couldn't think of it ! Weighs two hundred and fifty," replied the&#xD;
man.&#xD;
" I know the varmint--don't trust him," added Meltiah.&#xD;
" Aint you coming? " continued the applicant, impatiently.&#xD;
"Wait until morning," said Harper.&#xD;
"4What ! and let a feller critter die! That isn't the nature of my bringing' up.&#xD;
Jt allers puts me in pain to see a poor man die for want of a little attention. I&#xD;
never could bear to see an individual shakin' himself away to kingdom come with&#xD;
the ager,"&#xD;
Harper thereupon assured the fellow that he did not see fit to comply with his&#xD;
request.; upon which, with some farther importunity, he went away, apparently&#xD;
highly indignant at his ill success.&#xD;
At the'expiration of a quarter of an hour, three persons appeared bringing&#xD;
what -appeared to be a heavy burden. As they drew nearer, it proved to be a&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"1More gammon !" said Meltiah.&#xD;
" Stay where you are--don't, come any nearer I" shouted Noon, through a&#xD;
loop-hole.&#xD;
4'We've got the man with fever and ager, and be shakes so that it takes two&#xD;
of us to hold his har on."&#xD;
" Approach at your peril I" replied Noon.&#xD;
"You can't be so onhuman as to deny shelter to a sick person," retorted the&#xD;
spokesman of the party.&#xD;
"Put him down and let him come along, and we'll take care of him," re-&#xD;
turned- Noel.&#xD;

THE MAID OF THE RANCHE.&#xD;
&#xD;
- ' Can't walk a step, the travel is all shaken out of him,' was the rejoinder.&#xD;
"You're sure he can't wally ?"&#xD;
" Not if all the Camanches were after him."&#xD;
"I'll, test that," said Noon, in a low voice to Harper, and immediate dis.&#xD;
charged one barrel of his pistol.-&#xD;
The effect of this harmless shot was instant and wonderful:th  dropped the&#xD;
sick man, who, the moment he had recovered from the shock of his unexpected.&#xD;
fall, scrambled to.his feet, and scampered away .after his companions, without&#xD;
giving any particular indications of the shakes.&#xD;
" Now they'll have to unmask their battery, I take it," observed Melt iah, and&#xD;
he was qiute,-correct ; for in a few moments a party of eighteen or twenty per-&#xD;
sons appeared in sight,-headed by Manuel Hart, who insolently ordered Harper&#xD;
and his friend to come out-to them, stating that refusal woulded be attend with&#xD;
prompt and summary punishment.-&#xD;
To this demand, our friends of course paid no attention.' Manuel stormed&#xD;
and threatened, and advanced as near the-camp as he dared. Noon assured him&#xD;
that if he fired upon them, they should return the compliment, and admonished&#xD;
him to keep off;, but.he refused to listen, and after consulting a few moments&#xD;
with Jack Lawless, told someof his coadjutors to commence hostilities by firing&#xD;
upon the camp, when several balls perforated the door, and lodged in logs at the&#xD;
opposite side.1&#xD;
Both Harper and his friend Were at loss how to act under the circumstances.&#xD;
The idea of  shedding blood, was repugnant to their feelings'; and yet there ap-&#xD;
peared ;to.be no other alternative. Stern necessity bade thm retaliate and de-&#xD;
fend themselves to the last. They deplored the urgency of the emergency which&#xD;
.compelled them to turn their arms against those who ought' to be neighbors and&#xD;
brethren..&#xD;
"iWe must return the fire," said Maurice,"' but for one, I will endeavor to&#xD;
wound without destroying life."  *&#xD;
"I haven't been gifted with no such nice scruples as them," said Meltiah,&#xD;
"and I wont say that'them as.I hit 'll live,"&#xD;
Harper discharged one of his barrels, and the right arm of a fellow reloading&#xD;
his rifle, dropped powerless by his side. The ball badepassed through- it break-&#xD;
ing the bone. Noel and Moss both followed .his example in firing, and their&#xD;
shots took effect, inflicting apparently serious injuries' ~.&#xD;
Intimidated by this unanticipated demonstration, the parties fell hastily bank,&#xD;
taking shelter under the bank of the river from whence they continued to fire at&#xD;
random taking good care to expose their persons as little as possible. , Know-&#xD;
ing that this mode of warfare would not effect their object, unless some chance&#xD;
shot should pass through a crevice or the door, and do the bloody deed which&#xD;
was in contemplation, Hart incited his companions to make a sudden charge&#xD;
and perform the work at once.&#xD;
This they attempted, but met with a reception that repulsed them, with the&#xD;
loss-of two of their number, while at the same time Hart was wounded in the&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
Men of real resolution and courage would certainly have pressed the attack,&#xD;
without once thinking of failure or retreat ; but this faction not been engaged&#xD;
in a worthy cause, could'not.summon to their aid those high qualities which al&#xD;
ways ensar a victory ; and' after some considerations withdrew, taking with' them&#xD;
their wounded. What their object was, the next chapter will, more fully&#xD;
develop.                                                  .     . -.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER Xy,&#xD;
THE LIPAN CHIEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
SMARTING with the pain of his wound, chagrined by his want of success, and&#xD;
thirsting for vengeance, Manue Hart prepared to make a more build, decisive at-&#xD;
tack. In carrying out his purposes, he had not anticipated any resistance, sup-&#xD;
posing that Harper and his friend would at once succumb to his demands, and&#xD;
awed by numbers, not be presumptuous enough to offer ;any resistance.&#xD;
Having been so much disappointed in this expectation, he was now more than&#xD;
ever desirous to put his original intentions into execution. .,His.coidjutors, also,&#xD;
on account of the.punishment which they had received, were impatient to make&#xD;
a more effective demonstration. The faction was divided into four parties, who&#xD;
were to advance upon the camp in different directions ; and as they believed&#xD;
there were but two persons to oppose them, they could not well resist an attack&#xD;
made at so many points.&#xD;
Another ingenious device was resorted to, to secure their personal safety in&#xD;
this unequal warfare, and was an expedient which brave men, would have scorned&#xD;
to adopt, under the circumstances.&#xD;
They felled a large cypress, put it into lengths corresponding to the height of&#xD;
a man, and then split them in the manner that tiles afe riven. These pieces&#xD;
were of sufficient width to cover a person advancing, and thick enough, as they&#xD;
believed, to be bullet proof. Each man was to carry one of these monster tiles&#xD;
before him, and thus advance with impunity upon their victims.&#xD;
This scheme certainly looked very hopeful, and while they were maturing it,&#xD;
we will see how things, are going at the little cabin, which was being besieged.&#xD;
While they were gloomily listening .to the axes of their assailants, Harper.&#xD;
who was looking from a loop-hole on the west side of the structure, fancied that&#xD;
he saw a figure creeping stealthily toward them from the cover of the trees. At&#xD;
first he could not determine whether it was really a person approaching, or some&#xD;
animal that was, perhaps, a nocturnal prowler about the premises. On this&#xD;
point his doubts were not of long continuance. The appearance advanced, grew&#xD;
more distinctly defined, and confirmed his first conjectures. It was a human&#xD;
being, whore object' evidently was to approach the camp; but what his inten-&#xD;
tion in so doing might be, was yet to be made a apparent. Nor did that remain&#xD;
a matter of uncertainty. The little park was elated with hope, when at length,&#xD;
the form of Warpath. the Lipan chief, was sufficiently defined to be recognized.&#xD;
Mauriceinstantly thrust his handkerchief through the opening and shook it.&#xD;
to assure him that'he was seen, and his motives appreciated.&#xD;
See pg this friendly signal, the red man glided quickly forward, and was in-&#xD;
stantly -admitted.&#xD;
" I have come," he said, in a low and impressive voice, " I have come to put&#xD;
my heel on the head of the big mocasson snake, and crush him into the grourid.&#xD;
He shall crawl no longer among the sheltering brakes,nor crouc ia the dark&#xD;
swamps. He shall strike no more with his treacherous fangs while he lurks in&#xD;
the bending grass. Ihave come with my braves to cut out his tongue, and des-&#xD;
 troy him, that my white brothers may walk among his favorite ,haunts without&#xD;
fear of being bitten by a serpent that never hisses before ie fixes his fangs 'into&#xD;
the flesh of his victim."&#xD;
"Thi *ords of the Lipan are cold water to one that is thirsty," responded;&#xD;
Harper.&#xD;
Dr like the voice of the Master of Life," added Noon.&#xD;

THE MAID- of THE RAIOHIC&#xD;
"Or like a tree that shelters one as doesn't like to fight in the open air, with&#xD;
nothin' afore him,," said Meltiah, sentimentally.&#xD;
a8I've just been to look at the white. traitor," resumed Warpath. " He is&#xD;
preparing to pounce upon you as some foul bird upon his prey. Part of my&#xD;
braves will come into the damp; the others will remain concealed among the&#xD;
trees to attack them in the rear, and so cut them off.'&#xD;
- Nothing could. be urged against the wisdomand practicability of this plan ;&#xD;
buttarper ventured to express an earnesthope that human life should be re-&#xD;
spected as much as possible. They were,.be averred his countrymen, but- men&#xD;
who were unhappily misdirected ; they had fatally mistaken the way of bappi-&#xD;
ness ; bad influences were continually acting upon them,; they were ignorant&#xD;
,nd,perverted minds, and In fact, were more truly objects of commiseration than&#xD;
f vengeance.                                                      .&#xD;
Noon endorsed these-sentiments to a certain extent, but expressed the idea&#xD;
that our hero was probably too lenient in his feelings, forgettng. in his compas-&#xD;
sion, the claims of justine. A floating population:of this kind he considered an&#xD;
absolutely curse to the country. Reform could scarcely be hoped for while.such&#xD;
depraved consociations existed. He believed that they should be thinned out&#xD;
like noxious weeds in a garden., They needed something to startle th  .,Com-&#xD;
mbon-place warnings ould not do ; they must be made to contempla death in&#xD;
its rnost sudden iand uppalling aspects, in order that they might pause and ask&#xD;
thermselves if they were prepared for a similar fate. Men who, associated for&#xD;
criminal purposes, in large bodies, he said,, seldom, reformed, but, rather grew&#xD;
worse.&#xD;
Warpath listened respectfully to these thoughts. and suggestions, apd theb re-&#xD;
plied to the purport that he had taken the matter into his own ,bands; that he&#xD;
was a chief-should lead his braves where and against whom he deemed it wise.&#xD;
The responsibility, in.this,'case, he gave them to understand, was his own.&#xD;
" They have," he added, " wronged my people. They have spelled the blood&#xD;
of the unprotected Lipan, when they found him sleeping.in his cabin, or hunting&#xD;
in the woods. They have.slain our warriors,. and insulted our women. They.&#xD;
have no people and'no country ; they belong to, nobody, they have- no homes,&#xD;
no governments, and no love to bind them anywhere. , They, are unfit to: live,&#xD;
and I have said that many of them shall perish. Do not speak ; the anger of&#xD;
the Lipans is kindled, and burns with afervent, flame. It asks for victims to&#xD;
appease the manesof their departed braves. They shall have them !"&#xD;
Noon and Harper made no reply.. The proud dignity, of the chief forbade&#xD;
rejoinder. They knew that his resolution was fixed, and could not be changed.&#xD;
A band of dark and robust warriors came stealing into the camp. In the&#xD;
dim moonlight they were grim as war-paint could make them, and silent as&#xD;
spectres of the dead.. The cabin was soon full of them, and iron barrels were&#xD;
bristling from every crevice and aperture.&#xD;
Though truly grateful to Heaven for this providental rescue, Harpernould&#xD;
not witness these preparations without regretting that the misdirected passions&#xD;
oftmen should lead to such results. He did not forget, however, to express in a,&#xD;
dignified and feeling manner, his sense of gratitude to the brave Lipan.&#xD;
Meltiah Moss wasg, highly pleased. with the turn affairs was now taking. He&#xD;
had 'hitherto entertained some serious apprehensions concerning his personal&#xD;
safet (a thing uppermost in his mind), but now he had the indescribable satis-&#xD;
fdction Of finding himself backed by the strongest party.&#xD;
.Iantime'the decisive and eventful moment drew near. The Moderators.ap-&#xD;
p oached cautiously at four points, , holding up before them.thecypress tiles&#xD;
which they had riven'for the purpose.    .&#xD;
"-How much better 'twould be for them " said Meltiah,." if they would take&#xD;
that business altogether, and do nothing but make shingles."&#xD;
&#xD;
TiE .MAID OF TuE RANCHE.&#xD;
Ignorant of what awaited them at the cabin, and of the-danger that 1ujked&#xD;
around them without they advanced with a feeling of security and confideie&#xD;
which they had not before experienced. Protected., by their wooden shiels,&#xD;
they even jested and laughed as they approached. They were quite sere that&#xD;
they had circumvented 'the-two foresters,-and that they'would surrender without&#xD;
farther resistance. It was a fatal mistake.&#xD;
On came the assailants, and not a 'shot-was fired. The Lipans were'wait'ng&#xD;
the expected signal-from their chief. It came at length like the shrill cry of&#xD;
the eagle, when he makes a swoopsand bears off: in triumph his struggling prey.&#xD;
The camp shook with the ,vehemenee' of the discharge that burst from: it on&#xD;
every side, while-thetree's and the forest scenery were lighted up almost simul-&#xD;
taneously with a continuous fire which poured its destruction upon the assailants&#xD;
in the rear.&#xD;
The wall of wooden shields was beaten down, the.'hands that held them lost&#xD;
their strength, either by the power of"the Angel of death, or -thrQugh 'terror; and&#xD;
soon the spot where Hartand his dissolute 'companions. had stood was hidden&#xD;
from view by-a dense cloud of; smoke..&#xD;
The leaden -volleys din1=not cease; they continued to' sweep 'the surrounding&#xD;
ground with rapidity: 'Presently the firing was suspended. The red warrigrs&#xD;
rushed as if- by a conimor impulse from the wood-and the cabin.&#xD;
Maurice shuddered; for'he khew their} purpose.; and while they were .gone, he&#xD;
heard mingling with theirshouts of exultation, hollow groans and sharp' -ries&#xD;
of agony. But the latter-indications were soon bushed ; a solemn silence brood,&#xD;
ed over the scene. The sulphurous smoke rolled away like dissolving mist. The&#xD;
rosy dawn reddened in'the far off west,.and struggling: beams of .light came t9&#xD;
dispel the domioancy of night.&#xD;
The Lipans erected a- war-post in front of the cabin, and forming a circle&#xD;
about it, performed the- scalp dance,,while sundry red 'trophies of savage victory&#xD;
were seen suspended at their belts.&#xD;
Harper and Noon did.not examine the spot where the Indians had performed&#xD;
the last; and to them,-important rite in the usagest of barbaric warfare. They&#xD;
did not askhow:many had fallen, or the names of those who had been swept.&#xD;
away by the'besom of destruction. They did not inquire if the body of Man.&#xD;
uel' Hart had been recognized, orwhether hehad escaped the effects of this sig&#xD;
nal blow.&#xD;
Meltiah, whose conscience was of a very complacent and yielding nature, did&#xD;
not trouble himself about these nice mofal distinctions, but shouted, danced,&#xD;
menaced the war-post, and hacked it with his hatchet as bravely and vauntingly&#xD;
as the warriors themselves. Probably his reform notions had not had sufficient&#xD;
time to leaven 'the whole lump of his disposition.&#xD;
Having shaken hands with Warpath, and thanked his braves ina becoming&#xD;
manner, our hero and- his friend mounted their horses and left the spot, glad *t&#xD;
behold new scenery, and to banish from\view the evidences of human conflict&#xD;
which had been so recently' presented on every side. The excitement'which&#xD;
these stirring scenes had produced in Noel's system, had effected a happy result.&#xD;
A gentle perspiration was induced which the exercise of riding on horsebaek&#xD;
kept up, thus relieving the cutaneous vessels from obstructions, and:throwing o$&#xD;
the fever which'1had prevailed.&#xD;

We must now request the'reader to accompany us to another scene, leaving&#xD;
our two friends to pursue their way atleisure toBurleson's camp. We will go&#xD;

88                   THE MAID OF THE RANCHES&#xD;
wall of considerable strength, and had formerly been .a convent of some note&#xD;
but had now fallen into decay and neglect, and had, of late years, been inhabited&#xD;
by a few sisters of charity, most of whom had left the place since the opening&#xD;
of- the war. . Our business being with other.characters, we shall not particular-&#xD;
ly notice those two or three sisters, who are still seen occasionally gliding in.and&#xD;
out of the premises.&#xD;
.   Seated in a gloomy apartment of this time-worn fabric, are two females. They&#xD;
are our heroine and her sister, The former sits at an antique desk writing. If&#xD;
the conventionalities of civilized life will overlook the impertinence, we will&#xD;
venture to glance over the shoulder of 'the fair one who is putting her thoughts&#xD;
upon paper. The words which are traced read in the following manner:&#xD;
" This uncertainty and mystery grows every day more insupportable. Why&#xD;
we are forced to make this long journey to this cheerless place, I do not know,&#xD;
and yet I cannot but suspect its object ; for it involves the honor and probity&#xD;
of -one whom nature should teach me to reverence and love. Alas! .I fear I do&#xD;
neither. But is it my fault? ?Would not paternal care and tenderness on his&#xD;

ed different ; but now the influence of that bad man is upon him. My mind&#xD;
often reverts to that singular stranger, Dorville. I know not why I am so much&#xD;
attracted towards him. My thoughtsufly to him as to a friend, while I am wholly&#xD;
ignorant of his character and history.-What shall I write concerning that gal-&#xD;
lant Virginian'?  What shall I say in extenuation of the wrong I have inadver-&#xD;
tently done him ?  I'sincerely hope that those dark rumors concerning him are&#xD;
unfounded-having their sole origin in the brain of an unscrupulous enemy. But&#xD;
why should I perplex myself with this subject? Why does my mind occupy it-,&#xD;
self with one who may be unworthy of my interest, and whom I may never see&#xD;
again.-Ramona is sad ; she is doubtless thinking of honest Noel Noon, and the&#xD;
new alliance which father proposes for her with the Mexican officer-Captain&#xD;
Morales."&#xD;
The reader will perceive that what we have read appears to be an extract&#xD;
from a diary, which is really the case ; andupon looking at the preceding pages,&#xD;
we shall find records of an earlier date, having reference to the journey from our&#xD;
heroine's horae on the Braz os to her present place of residence, but which we&#xD;
will not stop to examine. We will 'only make one more .extract from the same&#xD;
page, and under the date which she is now writing.&#xD;
" The whole plot is developed at last, and it is much worse than I had antici-&#xD;
pated. My suspicions in relation to Manuel Hart have indeed been but too well&#xD;
founded. He seeks, by the practice of the most cruel duplicity, to make me his&#xD;
wife ; and my father advocates-his cause-nay insists upon my compliance,,using&#xD;
language towards me which fills my mind wi-th terror. Whither can I fly for&#xD;
relief ?Who will espouse my cause, and protect me from oppression so unkind, so&#xD;
unjust, so repugnant? , I have never before been truly unhappy, but now I am&#xD;
indeed wretched. The rude woodsman has been here with Captain Morales, and&#xD;
has declared himself in terms too plain not to be understood; I expressed my&#xD;
sentiments freely ; he grew insolent, and left me in anger.&#xD;
"This is perhaps the danger of which Dorville warped me.. Strange Dorville I&#xD;
I -wish I could see him. At present I may consider myself a prisoner. Ramo-&#xD;
na is equally unhappy, and we think of attempting to escape from this place.&#xD;
But where should we go for shelter and sympathy ?"&#xD;
Having perused the foregoing, the reader will be able to form a tolerable ac-&#xD;
cdrate idea of the situation of the Rathburn girls. He will understand what&#xD;
Manuel;Hart wasidoing, while. he was connected with the Hunters of the Bor-&#xD;

THE MAID ' of THE RANCIIE&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
A STRANGE E DISCLOSURE.-&#xD;
Tae maidens were daily allowed the privilege of walking in the garden within&#xD;
the enclosure, but Rasthburn strictly enjoined on them that they were on no ac.&#xD;
count to attempt to go beyond. The excuse which he made for this injunction,&#xD;
was that the country was in such a troubled state that it would not be safe to&#xD;
do so, for enemies might be lurking in the vicinity, from whom they might ex-&#xD;
pect insult and captivity.&#xD;
:Although both the girls believed that this 'was not the real motive that in&#xD;
fluenced him, they were prudent enough not to express their'sentiments.&#xD;
On'the evening succeeding the foregoing scene, Iris and Raniona wishing for&#xD;
fresh air, availed themselves of what liberty was granted them, and walked among&#xD;
the trees and shrubbery within the grounds attached to the house. Their str-&#xD;
prise was great when they discovered that new and significant precautions had&#xD;
been taken. Two Mexican 'soldiers were keeping guard over the premises, and&#xD;
the points of their bristling bayonets could be seen above the walls, as they paced&#xD;
regularly their rounds.&#xD;
Iris, who was the first to perceive this circumstance, immediately called Ra-&#xD;
mona's attention to the same, asking her whether she thought the sentinels were&#xD;
to watch their movements and prevent their escape, or to secure their safety, and&#xD;
warn them of the approach of those who might not respect even female helpless-&#xD;
ness and innocence.&#xD;
Her sister was of the opinion that the first supposition was correct ; for their&#xD;
father's manner had changed much of late, and it was evidently his intention to&#xD;
coerce them into alliances repugnant to their better feelings, and in directions&#xD;
where their affections were not engaged, nor could be on account of the dispar-&#xD;
ity of taste, age and pursuits.&#xD;
"I have been attempting," she added, "to analyze his thoughts and intentions&#xD;
-to gain a deeper insight into his nature. I know that he was ever irritable&#xD;
in disposition, and subject to fits of melancholy, but he never manifested that&#xD;
forbidding sternness that now marks all his conduct. There is a deep mystery&#xD;
hanging about his actions which remains to be fathomed. I sometimes fear that&#xD;
his reason is dethroned."&#xD;
" He is absent minded, and often has to be addressed several times before ma-&#xD;
king any answer.  I have watched him 'during his solitary walks in and about&#xD;
this enclosure, and witnessed indubitable evidences of a mind suffering great anx-&#xD;
iety and unhappiness, ifnot remorse.  You know that our sympathies flow out&#xD;
in favor of the patriotic Texans, and father formerly was imbued with the same&#xD;
'feeling ; but how changed is he now I It is true (I speak it with.shame and regret),&#xD;
that he holds correspondence with the enemies of Texas. You are aware that&#xD;
he talks much with Captain Morales, and is frequently with him. It fills me with&#xD;
sorrow to see him tampering with those-seeking to enslave our countrymen, and&#xD;
place upon their limbs the shackles of bondmen.&#xD;
"I have long observed his growing partiality and sympathy withthe degrad-&#xD;
ing policy of Santa Anna, bet respect for the paternal character has hitherto&#xD;
prevented me from speaking to you so freely on the subject. There is one thing&#xD;
perhaps that you may have remarked," she.added, in a low tone ; " that is, that&#xD;
our father hasan inordinate thirst for gold. I fear it is his idol-the ambition&#xD;
of -his life-the predominating idea that haunts him  always. It pursues him&#xD;
during the day, ahd disturbs his dreams by night. I have noticed the mental pain&#xD;
which he appears to suffer, and though he never realized to me my highest con-&#xD;
ceptions of a parent, I behold, with secret dread, his increasing sternness.. Shall&#xD;
I say it, Ramon,-- he never was to me a father, and the chords of my affections&#xD;
never responded to what few words of endearment he may have bestowed upon&#xD;

I speak of it?"&#xD;
"Rush I" said Iris, -in a whisper. " He is approaching, and Hart is&#xD;
with him."&#xD;
The maidens instantly secreted themselves behind some dense shrubbery to&#xD;
avoid being seen. Rathburn and Hart approached conversing earnestly. Por-&#xD;
tions of the conversation the young ladies were able to hear.&#xD;
iart appeared to be in bad -temper, while Rathburn was gloomy, and also&#xD;
,somewhat ,iritable.&#xD;
I tell you I wont be put off," said Manuel. "I'm ready to do all I said I&#xD;
would. The gal is here, and there's nothin' to hinder."&#xD;
"Try soft words," responded Rathburn.&#xD;
"Dios ! Much good they will dot' I'd as soon thinkof ,coaxing a fox from&#xD;
his hole with corn, or catchin' a weasel asleep. I can tell by the flash of the&#xD;
girl's eye, 'that fiatterin' ways aint of no use, whatsomever. Nothin' but fear&#xD;
and force will ever bring her to it, and you might as well make up your mind to&#xD;
it first as last."&#xD;
"Business enough I business enough   to marry off two young women against&#xD;
eir wishes I I'm perplexed and harassed nearly to madness. Hart,,you'll make&#xD;
me desperate."&#xD;
You know what I can do,"rejoined Manuel, sullenly.&#xD;
"Betraying our countrymen for money, is another thing I don't greatly-&#xD;
relish."&#xD;
1It'll always be well for you to bear in Mind the perticerlers of that ill case,&#xD;
for fear your conscience 'll=get too'tender," added Hart, with a sneer.&#xD;
Maledietions upon you and the will, both I" retorted Rathburn, bitterly.&#xD;
"What you're doin' aint no worse than what you have done; and a:good pile&#xD;
of bank notes or Mexican dollars will make a good salve for your conscience.&#xD;
You know if I aboudonly-speak to the gal, and tell her what I know, you&#xD;
wouldn't be.able, I'ta exercise any more authority over her ; and if the&#xD;
news should get' to certain ears, you might be accommodated with lodgings in a&#xD;
habitation made of stone, and ornamented with grated windows."&#xD;
" The old story-the old story 'I muttered Rathburn, moodily.  "I never&#xD;

pervert mybetter impulses with threats and--.-"o&#xD;

Manuel's brow  grew  dark, 'and a more sinister gloom .gathered uponlia&#xD;
ountenan go,"he said, "to New Orleans, and tell that you have forged Mel&#xD;
cheated your sister's child of what belonged to her, and shut herout. of your *f-&#xD;
fhctions ;ver since."                                   eprsedi&#xD;
A deadly paleness overspread the features of Rathburn. He pressed his&#xD;
hand spasmodically to his forehead,-and seemed to stagger beneath the intensity&#xD;
of his emotions.&#xD;
"For God's sake, Hart, don't speak so loud I Some one might hear:-,it might&#xD;
ruin me, you know, and I never could, look the gals in the face again, if they&#xD;
should mistrust-this. ~ What misery it is to be -a villain."&#xD;
"You see how fast I've got you."&#xD;
" Yes-.yes ; fix your time. It shall be done. I can be stern, harsh and de-&#xD;
cided, and I will be."&#xD;
"cThat sounds better."&#xD;
" How do you succeed with the captain ?", added Rathburn, anxious to change&#xD;
the subject.&#xD;
"Swimmingly ! I have an appointment with him to-night, to finish up the&#xD;
affair. He's to pay me half of it down, and the rest arter the Hunters of the&#xD;
Borders are done for."&#xD;
It's u villanous transaction, and you may expect something  orse than im.&#xD;
prisonment, if you get detected."&#xD;
Manuel glanced uneasily at Rathburn.&#xD;
I hope you don't think' of informin'?" he said, quickly.&#xD;
Who thought of it ?" returned the other, drily.&#xD;
" No knowin' what people 'll do. Folks as '11 rob a 'friendless gal may. be&#xD;
tempted to do almost anythin'. . I dare say, I shan't Bever do worse than for-&#xD;
gin' a will."&#xD;
"       .No more, no more  Let it be understood between us, that you shall have&#xD;
her mn a week."&#xD;
Yes, one week from to-night."&#xD;
And with these words the two walked slowly from the grounds, leaving the&#xD;
two maidens agitated with emotions too painful to be described. They did not&#xD;
venture to leare their hiding-place for some moments. Clasping each other's&#xD;
hands, they trod the gloomy walks in silence, neither being calm enough to.speak&#xD;
of what they had heard.&#xD;
The developments of that hour was indeed calculated to awaken strange sen-&#xD;
sations in the minds of the maidens. Was it possible for them to misappre-&#xD;
heid the purport of what had been said in their heating?  Had they grasped&#xD;
the threads of the mystery and followed them 'to their termination ? Was there&#xD;
any room for misconstruction? Who was the child referred to by Hart? ?What&#xD;
was the secret of the will?&#xD;
These were questions of vital import. They presented themselves for solution&#xD;
with lightning rapidity, -and though neither spoke them aloud, they were none&#xD;
the less distinctly defined. Singular conceptions and suspicions could not but be&#xD;
aroused, and they all pointed in one direction.&#xD;
'The young ladies went back to 'their room in a whirl of amazement and&#xD;
doubt, such as they had never before experienced.&#xD;
They could not'sleep, but remained acutely wakeful, meditating upon what&#xD;
they had heard. The mystery of Manuel Hart'spower was bow apparent. Thoy&#xD;
had no longer 'cause to wonder why their father bowed to his influence, or$hy&#xD;
his brow was so oftenrclouded with gloom, and his soul .agitated with remorse.&#xD;
In the morning, the sisters were able to talk -with some degree of calhspess&#xD;
ipbn'the subject. They resolved;to endeavor to persuade their father to $y at&#xD;
once from the companionship of one so depraved ; to leave the country as spee-&#xD;
dily as possible, taking every precaution to leave to clue by which Hart 06uld&#xD;

in any distant land whither he might go. Of their discovery they agreed not to&#xD;
soek, but to keep him in ignorance of'their knowledge; but only pressing upon&#xD;
his consideration, that he could not-be happy while exposed to the influences of&#xD;
Hart.&#xD;
Soon after this conversation, the following was written in the diary which Iris&#xD;
kept.-&#xD;
"I put'my thoughts upon paper, in order to relieve the burden which oppres-&#xD;
ses my mind. What wonderful disclosures have been made !  I can scarcely&#xD;
realize that I am not the subject of some deceptive dream. I perceive what the&#xD;
truth must be, and yet I dare not speaker write it. I know why -my heart has&#xD;
not turned to him with filial yearnings. The true instincts of nature have been&#xD;
obeyed., 'Where shall I look for that paternal tenderness which my being de-&#xD;
mands? Shall I ever fully penetrate the mystery which isolates 'ne, and makes-&#xD;
me one destitute of the common sympathies of life?&#xD;
"Manuel Hart spoke of a forged will, a child robbed of her heritage, and&#xD;
treated with coldness and neglect. Who was that unfortunate child?  My in-&#xD;
ner nature tells me who ; it is as palpable to me as sunlight. Am Ian orphan,&#xD;
and shall I be thrown upon the world without knowing more of my own history?&#xD;
Decicive steps must be taken. I had rather be a wanderer up and down the,&#xD;
wide and unknown world, than to be linked with the degrading companionship&#xD;
of that unprincipled man. I will labor with my hands for those who will em-&#xD;
ploy me, for all the necessities of existence. Yes, I will be the servant of ser-&#xD;
vants, and think myself happy in being' so, provided I escape the machinations&#xD;
of Manuel Hart.-If the man I have been taught to call father, will not listen&#xD;
to the voice of prudence and reason, and seek safety in flight, alone and unpro-&#xD;
tected I will steal from this place to encounter whatever fate may be reserved&#xD;
for one weak and friendless like myself.-Ramona had spoken to him in relation&#xD;
to this matter. 'His fears and suspicions are terribly awakened by the circum-&#xD;
stance. He evidently would like to leave the country, but dare not ; and Ramo-&#xD;
na's importunity has had only the effect to make him more wretched, and more&#xD;
watchful over us; so our condition is no better, nor our prospects of relief brigh-&#xD;

do so."&#xD;
.CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
C'A          PTERVTH  O N V VN T  G R O U N D'S.  -&#xD;
DoRVILLE stood upon the bank of the San Miguel. His brow was shaded with&#xD;
thought, and a melancholy expression played pensively.about hislips.&#xD;
" I'm full of perplexing thought," he said. "Strange suspicions agitate my&#xD;
soul. But I must be rational, nor permit fancy tQ;usurp the place of reason. I&#xD;
inust not suffer myself to be deceived with hope, or transported with vague ex-&#xD;
pectation. I, must find the thread of the mysterybefore I attempt to unwind it.&#xD;
Why am I attracted towards Iris Rathburn? Why have I been so deeply dis-&#xD;
appointed by her inexplicableidisappearance?' Is it.simply because her spirit is&#xD;
congenial, and her face and figure resemble those of my sainted wife-or is it&#xD;
because ny soul, made desolate by bereavement, seeks to indemnify its losses by&#xD;
tle companionship ?    But I must not forget the true obie%,t of my pursuit.&#xD;
v seen Rathbrin bit twice since I have been in this part of the country, and&#xD;
mgoken with hini but once, and then but briefly. It struck me that I had some-&#xD;
'where heard his voice before and seen his face ; the thought was a transient one,&#xD;
.and soon ceased to be remembered. I must endeavor to learn more of his his&#xD;
toUy, and the internal monitor keeps assuring me that I ought to seek him out&#xD;
and study him'&#xD;
&#xD;
Dorville ceased soliloquizing, and walked slowly up the river. He soon came&#xD;
within sight of a large dwelling, enclosed by a wall of considerable height. Cu-&#xD;
riosity prompted him to turn towards it.&#xD;
As he approached, he was somewhat surprised to see a soldier's musket lean-&#xD;
ing against said wall. Impelled by the same feelir that had induced him to&#xD;
advance, he examined the premises more minutely.  Passing the musket and&#xD;
nearing the angle of the enclosure, he beheld a Mexican soldier conversing with&#xD;
a female, whom he knew by her.garb to be a sister of charity. Dorville turned&#xD;
to scrutinize the rear of the fabric, and discovered on the opposite side another&#xD;
soldier, who was walking to and fro, evidently performing the duty of sentinel.&#xD;
Now these indications struck him as being very singular, and he queried in&#xD;
his own mind in regard to what the building contained..,That it was a convent&#xD;
was the most natural thought.  But what were the two soldiers there, for ?&#xD;
Were they to keep nuns from running away, or .for the purpose of protection?&#xD;
While these thoughts were passing through Dorville's mind, he saw a female&#xD;
figure at one of the lower windows. It wain ar night, but not dark enough to&#xD;
prevent hira from seeing the. figure quite dminctly, and he imagined that it re-&#xD;
sembled one whom he had seen. He at once formed the project of scaling the&#xD;
-wall. Why he wished to do so, he could not well explain, even to himself;' but he&#xD;
*esolved to carry the idea into practice, which could not well be done while in&#xD;
such close proximity to the guard. What could he do to obviate this difficulty ?&#xD;
Should he wait until it was darker, or commence operations at once? Should he&#xD;
attempt to bribe the sentinel from whom he feared the most danger of discovery?&#xD;
Should he try to elude his vigilance by the adroitness of his movements, or should&#xD;
he resort to less amicable methods, watch his opportunity to spring upon and dis-&#xD;
arn him ?&#xD;
He resolved to-make trial of the second expedient, and climb softly and stea-&#xD;
- dily over the adjoining wall into the grounds. He placed his hands upon the&#xD;
barrier before hini, and had already began to mount, when the soldier who had&#xD;
been chatting with the nun, returned to his duty, and approached the spot leisure-&#xD;
ly, singing a national air.&#xD;
Dorville instantly relaxed his grasp, and threw himself flat upon his face. The&#xD;
fellow came on directly toward him, and so near that he thought discovery inevita-&#xD;
ble, and was feeling for' his pistol when the man turned and sauntered. in.an op-&#xD;
posite direction.&#xD;
Meantime the other sentinel advanced to the other angle, and called to his friend&#xD;
asking him, in a jesting way, how be sped with his wooing.&#xD;
Dorville now feared that he would turn bacl to conkerse- with his friend on&#xD;
this to him, no'doubt, interesting subject ;'in which event he could not hope to&#xD;
remain undiscovered. Fortunately this did not occur'; the soldier gave some eva-&#xD;
sive answer, and continued on as before, humming his song.&#xD;
Seeing that his comrade was not in a social mood, the other imitated his ex-&#xD;
a ample, turned upon his heel with military precision, and went whistling on his&#xD;
rounds, in defiance of discipline.&#xD;
Now seemed a favorable chance for Dorville to put his:intention in practice,&#xD;
and 'so arising from his rather uncomfortable position, he began to climb, again ;&#xD;
but unluckily a stoke, loosened by time and storm, rolled;from its place, making&#xD;
quite a noise in its descent. Instantly the sentinel who had refused to talk a mo-&#xD;
ment before, shouted to his companion, desiring to know why he was tumbling&#xD;
down 'the wall.&#xD;
The individual addressed promptly denied having any agency in the mutter,&#xD;
insinuating at'the same time that there must be-somebody on. his side tryi  to&#xD;
getin. This intimation, however, was received with great contempt, he averring&#xD;
that he had just walked the whole length of his round to the angle of, the wall,&#xD;
which was not true.&#xD;
Both the men moved on again, and Dorville proceeding more cautiously, suc-&#xD;

SI dare not think of it. I know,-I feplWhat the truth must be, and yet&#xD;

" The proposition startles'me. I wish, and yet 1 fear to know the height and&#xD;
depth of this strange matter. I feel internally assured that when any new re-&#xD;
vealmeits are'made concerning-the subject, they will confirm all our, suspicions.&#xD;
" But in relation to{this box,-since we lost the Ranche I have not seen it, nor&#xD;

proached them. They were about to retreat to the convent in alarm, when- the&#xD;
sound of hisvoice assured them of the identity of the individual.&#xD;
"mow providential is this meeting," he said, grasping their hands 'warmly&#xD;
"am so superstitious that I am prone to think that heaven has sent melere to&#xD;
.work out its own-good purpo."&#xD;
" Was it honorable, Mr. Dorville,"said Iris, "to listen to a conversation which&#xD;
you must have known was not intended for the ears of a third person:?"&#xD;
"4Results may grow out of this circumstance of which you can 'form no pos-&#xD;
sible conception. Be not indignant, for 1 could 'not but have listened, if every&#xD;
word had endangered my life. I willhasten to relieve a portionof your anxiety.&#xD;
You need apprehend but little from Manuel Hart. He has been detected, tried&#xD;
by a 'court-martial, finally convicted and sentenced to death, which adjndgment&#xD;
would have been carried into execution, had not the faction to which'he belong-&#xD;
ed overpowered the guard. one night, and rescued him from the grasp of' justice."&#xD;
"But where is he now ?" inquired Iris.&#xD;
" It is suspected that he has gone up the Brazos, for the purpose of taking&#xD;
vengeance upon Noel Noon and Maurice harperr."&#xD;
" And why are Noel Noon and Maurice Harper upon the Brazos, id not&#xD;
with the' Hunters of the Border at Burleson's, camp ?" inquired Ramona.&#xD;
" They are trying to gain some clue to your sudden disappearance," returned&#xD;
Dorville,&#xD;
Both the maidens colored,-and Dorville resumed in a deeper and more earnest&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"'I have heard, with singular emotions, youb'remarks concerning' the subject&#xD;
now paramount in your minds. Hasten to carryout your design. Find the&#xD;
box of which you have spoken. If you cannot open it, take me'i to.your con-&#xD;
fidence, and I will aid you faithfully and truly. Wonder not that I tam 'inter-&#xD;
ested, for time will'explain the matter more perfectly."&#xD;
"To us you are'-comparatively a stranger. We, have no means -of knowing&#xD;
howfgr you are entitled to our confidence. : Accident has discovered what you&#xD;
might otherwise never have known.  I trust you will at least respect -our'feelings&#xD;
enough'to keep the subject a secret ?" said Iris, somewhat reproachfully.&#xD;
" Iris, ask your own heart if.you can trust me, and seemwhat it will say? If&#xD;
soul ever spoke to soul, you-know that mine responds -to-yours. Betray ou,&#xD;
you feel that I cannot'; and-yet coMmnon -worldly prudence admonishes yu to&#xD;
cautiousness. And now let me nsk, why you're here, and if you arecontent&#xD;
and;happy                  en&#xD;
"'I will tell you frankly;" replied Iris, after a pause, and then proceeded to re-&#xD;
late all that had happened respecting Manuel Hart and' Captain Morales.&#xD;
"It is' as 'I suspected," rejoined Dorville. "This is the dadiger of which I&#xD;
warned you ; but the villain shall yet be baffled. Remain here and. be calh.&#xD;
You-are and shall be;;from: this moment protected. Hard indeed:shall it fare&#xD;
withhim who presumes to harm -a hair -of your. head. A shield ot strength&#xD;

which some unexpected disclosure has aroused, make you wretched. Soinething&#xD;

Although words -like yours from other lips I might'deem bold and. presum.&#xD;

so ently tbrought e gan4en of my most sacred thoughts, that I almost feel that&#xD;

yDorville made no rejoinder, but caught her hand, pressed it tenderly to. his&#xD;
lips, and then turning, hurried from the grounds, leaped the wall and disappeared.&#xD;
CHAPI'ER XVIII.&#xD;
Oua hero and Noel Noon, after a long and fatiguing :ride reached Burleson's&#xD;
camp. Harper's first impulse wasto inquire for Dorville; for his-interest in that&#xD;
individual had increased much since the discovery of Manuel Hart's traitorous'&#xD;
designs. He was about to seek him at'his tent when he was luckily spared the&#xD;
trouble ; Dorville unexpectedly made his appearance. He manifested an ear-&#xD;
nest desire to know th incidents of their journey to the Brazos, and the 'cause&#xD;
of their delay.-&#xD;
Maurice immediately gave a succit account of what is already -known to the&#xD;
readeF.&#xD;
"And you know nothing," said Dorville, "of the fate .of Manuel Hart and&#xD;
Jack Lawless ?"-&#xD;
Our hero assured him that it was out of his power to give him any informa-&#xD;
tion on that subject, for his better nature had recoiled from the contemplation&#xD;
of the field after the conflict, if conflict it could be called. He had chosen to&#xD;
remain in ignorance in regard to the extent.of the destruction of life that''must&#xD;
haveresulted from the continuous volleys- of the Lipans. He gave it as his&#xD;
opinion, however, that but few of the faction had escaped to: tell the tale of&#xD;
their disaster.-&#xD;
" Bad' men," said Dorville, "do not die easily, and I doubt not but Hart and&#xD;
Jack Lawless are still among the living, maturing plans of vengeance. But, to&#xD;
change.the subject, I have important newsfor you. I have.discovered whither&#xD;
your lady-birds have flown."&#xD;
Noel Noon, who, hitherto, had not been giving much Attention to the conver-&#xD;
sation, instantlymanifested incontestable evidence of interest.&#xD;
" Upon the San Miguel, just below; there is a convent much fallen into decay&#xD;
and disuse, and there Rathburn and his daughters may be found."&#xD;
Having made this announcement, Dorville'proceeded to detail with consider.&#xD;
able minuteness the manner-in which he had made the discovery ; withholding,&#xD;
however, everything relating to the interview to which he had been a party in&#xD;
the convent grounds.&#xD;
The strange suspicions that had so agitated his thoughts were riot referred to,&#xD;
for he prefered thattime should make its own proper developments without&#xD;
being anticipated. It is true that he had heard but a few words concerningjthe&#xD;
secrets that weighed down the spirit-of Iris, but sometimes even a word may&#xD;
sere to unlock the -profoundest mystery. That potent key Dorville now be-&#xD;
lieved }he had in hispedsession.. Although matters of the most absorbing, in-&#xD;
terest to him were -involved, he kept, as he :had ever done, the history of his&#xD;
fears, hopes and expectations deeply buried in his being. His strong and com-&#xD;
manding mind, disciplined by vicissitudes and sorrow, had learned how- to dis-&#xD;
guise its emotions,:and conceal its thoughts.&#xD;
aMaurice looked at his face, now more serious than he had ever .beforeseen&#xD;
it he. fancied that "its lineaments strangely reminded him of : one upon whose&#xD;
beauty'she had gazed:iwith admiration ; kbut hewas far, very fat from entertain-&#xD;
ing the most vague and distant suspicion of the singular conceptions and antici-&#xD;
pations that were passing through his brain.&#xD;
As our hero surveyed his manly figure and expressive countenance, a pang .of&#xD;
jealousy disturbed the current of his reflections. Though feeling somewhat&#xD;
&#xD;
grakful for The efforts he had made in behalf of the maidens, he could not banish&#xD;
all seliih considerations ; for'he had, in some inexplicable manner made a dis-&#xD;
covery that Iris Rathburn was necessary to his happiness, and he feared that a&#xD;
man of Dorville's insinuating'address,' agreeable manners, and strong good sense,&#xD;
might prove a most dangerous rival, notwithstanding the disparity of ages.&#xD;
Noon now inquired if it were practicable for them to visit the convent ; re-&#xD;
marking to the effect that Morales might gine them farther trouble, and that&#xD;
Manuel Hart, if he had survived the vengeance of the LIpans, would still make&#xD;
efforts to put his villanons designs into' execution. Dorville after meditating a&#xD;
moment expressed his willingness to accompany them to the spot, as soon.as it&#xD;
was dark enough for such an undertaking.&#xD;
Accordingly, all the' preliminaries' being arranged, when the proper hour ar-&#xD;
rived, they left camp to carry out their intentions.&#xD;
When they had approached within sight of the convent,-Dorville went for-&#xD;
ward to'reconnoitre, and learn ,if any additional precautionshad been taken since&#xD;
his last visit, and our hero and his, friend patiently awaited his return. - At the&#xD;
expiration of half an 'hour, they were alarmed by hearing the rapid discharge of&#xD;
-five or six pistol shots.&#xD;
"There goes Dorville's revolver 1" exclaimed Noon, starting to his feet. "Let-&#xD;
us run to his assistance."&#xD;
Harper and Noel immediately ran toward the scene of the disturbance. Upon&#xD;
emerging from the clump of trees where; they had taken shelter, the exact state&#xD;
of the case became apparent. A company of 'Mexicans had pitched their tents&#xD;
in close proximity to theconvent, and Dorville had unfortunately been discover-&#xD;
ed by the guard, and it was now too late to rescue him, for he had already been&#xD;
overwhelmed by numbers and secured, while the 'soldiers were still pouring out&#xD;
of their tents like bees from an-agitated hive.&#xD;
c"Too late !' too late I" muttered Noon. " There is nothing that we can-do&#xD;
now to help him, and I'ni afraid that it'll go bard with him, for he'has probably&#xD;
done some inischief with his revolver, which they wont feel disposed to&#xD;
forgive."   .s-&#xD;
"T perceive," said Harper, " that we seem to be cut off from the possibility of&#xD;
rendering hire any assistance, but it's against my nature to be compelled toaban-&#xD;
dona friend to the, cruelty of such enemies without making an effort:to nave&#xD;
him. I think we ought to remain here a short time: and watch the progress o1&#xD;
events.t' "We can't do no-good," responded Noel, regretfully.&#xD;
" We can at least  assure ourselves if he is executed upon the spot or not."&#xD;
"1That's'true ; but it wouldn't be strange if they marched him right out a fea&#xD;
paces in front, and shot him down as though he wasn't a human cretur."&#xD;
"No'," said Maurice, " they will not do that, according to appearances."&#xD;
"There's no tellin'; you see they're consultin'.about something' now, and i&#xD;
shouldn't wonder if that tall chap with the jaunty coat, was giving anorder 'to&#xD;
that effect now."&#xD;
" The merciful God forbid I I do not think that I can stand here and see&#xD;
him murdered, without makinglan effort to save him., See I-they have drawn&#xD;
up twelve men in lin e,and in that prompt and'decisive way that characters&#xD;
military executions.&#xD;
"If there was time," said Noon, "to go after the Hunters of'the Border.'&#xD;
"1There's nothing like trying," returned Harper. "I.will hasten back to the&#xD;
spotwhere we left our, horses, mount and ride with all speed for assistance&#xD;
Our -brave lads will scatter, you fellows as the whirlwind scatters the dust.?&#xD;
"Perhaps it would be wise for you to try it, for you see they don't appear to&#xD;
be in any great hurry about doing their bloody work. If be was only shrewd&#xD;
enough to gain time in 'sbme way how easy 'twould be to save him. " Look!t&#xD;
there goes a priest 1 i Upon my soui, I believe he's playin thiatgame, and if he'lh&#xD;
contrive to be: long enough at confession, he'll escape the disagreeable ceremony&#xD;
tilit' intended to come 'afterwards."&#xD;

Ritchings ; and Iris is not his daughter, ,but :his niece. Her own father was&#xD;
lost at sea while she was an infant, and her mother died'before she was two&#xD;
years old. Theylived in New, Orleans, and I' was there and knew all ,aut it.&#xD;
Mrs. Dalton, the mother of Iris, was possessed of mdh propertyin, her own&#xD;
right, and willed it all to her only child, appointing Ritchings her guardian and&#xD;
executor. I was a servant in: her family then, and knew what happened, and&#xD;
what I'm gom' to tell. The man who calls hiunmelf Rathburn got possession of&#xD;
his sister's will, and altered it to suit himself, bribing the notary to assist him.&#xD;
I worked-myself into -the secret by listening at the key-hole of an adjoining.&#xD;
room. I let the thing go on.because I knew that Illtchings would'be willing&#xD;
to buy my silence at a high figure. I was then but a mere lad, but old enough&#xD;
to be cunning , vicious, and unpricipled. I succeeded well in my plans, and-ex&#xD;
torted sums of money from him at different times. Soon. after the'reading of&#xD;
the will, gathering up all the wealth thus unjustly sequred, the left that partof&#xD;
the-country, thiukin' no loubtiid himself of :me. .le took Iris with him,&#xD;
and passed himself ,off for hers father by the name le goes by now. Bt'&#xD;
tracked him, and he couldn't shake me off. His wife died about the time of his&#xD;
departure from New Orleans, leavln' .ne daughter, Ramona, about the same age&#xD;
of Iris. So-there was nobody to meddle with his plans ; consequently he was&#xD;
very successful, and the two girls grew up as sisters. The greatest drawback&#xD;
upon the happiness of Rathburn, was my continual doggings ; for in fact I&#xD;
literally lived on him, and kept him in fear by repeated threats. When he&#xD;
settled up in Brazos river, he thought, he had completely outwitted me ; but I&#xD;
scented him like a hound, and Iris, havia' grown to a pretty young woman, ]&#xD;
