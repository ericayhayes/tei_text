CHAPTER L'&#xD;
T o-Introduction.&#xD;
HOLLA4N has sent to our shores ,many of her best eitisens.&#xD;
She has the merit also of having commenced two hundred and&#xD;
forty years ago, and some of the best families in New York&#xD;
are of the Neder Duitch stock. The country is overstocked&#xD;
with h6ck deutschers of more recent importation.&#xD;
Not many years ago I made. a visit to Holland. 'I resided&#xD;
for some months in Delft, the capital of Delftiland in the Prov&#xD;
ince of Holland. Raving business at the Royal Academy,&#xD;
where I was having various models made, I endeavoredto, pro-&#xD;
cure a residence in a private family. .,Through the exertions&#xD;
of Professor Lipkins I succeeded; and the second' dayafter&#xD;
my arrival, found ,myself installed into a quietcountry villa&#xD;
about. half a mile from the city. It was located upoi the bank&#xD;
of the canal that connects Delft with the Hague. My host,&#xD;
whose name was Van Hagen, was a man of great age and hia&#xD;
vrouw was still younger. They had no children, but occupied&#xD;
this beautiful villa alone. It. had4a large and well cultivated&#xD;
garden attached to it, and its neatness and luxuries still leave&#xD;
a pleasing impression upon my mind-&#xD;
Over the gate was a motto-but whether it was indicative&#xD;
of the mind of the owner, or his coat of arms* or indicated the&#xD;
character of the place, I never inquired I wA in gold let.&#xD;
ters, or made of brass, gildedl-LusT' aN Rtr ope and&#xD;

It was a pleasant morning's walk, from wy bt , oantry&#xD;
villa into the city of Delft, and the sudden transition from the&#xD;

&#xD;
tranquility of the country to the busy hum of men was very&#xD;
striking.  The canals, with their numerous drawbridges in&#xD;
the heart of the city, lined with Treckschuiyts of all sorts and&#xD;
sizes, gave a relief from country quietness.&#xD;
The first meal of which I partook at my new home was a&#xD;
solitary one. Every thing was neat, and -the victuals well&#xD;
cooked. I had a silver fork by my side, and the table cloth&#xD;
was of snowy whiteness and n the roem in which I dined was&#xD;
a glass China cupboard, and every article within it bore shining&#xD;
testimony of its having received a due proportion of diurnal&#xD;
care. After my meal was finished I was joined by my aged&#xD;
host and his worthy lady. They had dined previous to my,&#xD;
arrival. He addressed me in English, somewhat to my surf%&#xD;
prise, and remarked--"You are an American.1&#xD;
I replied that I was, and he added, "Had you not been, I&#xD;
should not have consented to entertain you even at the request&#xD;
of my old friend the Professor of the Royal Academy."  "You&#xD;
seem to be partial to Americans, and I certainly feel thankful&#xD;
that it is so, for Deift is a gloomy place, while her6 I am alrea-&#xD;
dy at home. But why are you so friendly to America .). I&#xD;
asked.  He replied "I once thought of going to America.&#xD;
My brother went out there many years ago, with a young wife.&#xD;
It was during the time that the French occupied Holland,. and&#xD;
our king was then Louis, the brother of Napoleon. He was&#xD;
ambitious to restore the fallen fortunes of. our house, for we&#xD;
are one of the oldest families in Holland; and some day when&#xD;
we visit 'the city, I *ill show you a monument in the "nOU&#xD;
kirk " at Delft of one of our name, who was buried in 1562,&#xD;
and was a famous scholar in his day. Now, my young friend&#xD;
all of our old race are in America except myself._- Had my&#xD;
brother not died, I should have .sold my property here, and&#xD;
followed him overe the sea.. I am not rich, but in comfortable,&#xD;
circumstances, and as a Director appointed by the Government&#xD;
to keep the dams and roads in repair I- receive a handsome&#xD;
fxed salhxrj, and an content to live and die where my anees&#xD;
tors for five hundred years before me have lived and died.'&#xD;
I listened to the old gentleman's remarks, with the very&#xD;
deepest interest, and after he had concluded I asked, "What&#xD;
part of America did your brother and his wife go to' .&#xD;
"To Char1ston, i t'We.Southern part of America," replied&#xD;
the old gentleman with great simplicity.&#xD;
"To Chadeston in South Carolina, you probably mean."&#xD;
"Yes, that was the place.".&#xD;
&#xD;
"You have heard from your brother frequently, I presume,&#xD;
before he died ?" I asked.&#xD;
"Yes, frequently, until somewhere about the time that Wa-&#xD;
terloo was, fought. That was when 94"&#xD;
"In 1815," I added.&#xD;
"Yes. Soon after then I got a letter from him  He had&#xD;
been very successful in business, and had acquired considera-&#xD;
ble property as a merchant.  He owned a plantation and ne-&#xD;
groes, but he wrote me that his health was ft4ling. lHe had&#xD;
two children, both girls. Not long after I received the letter&#xD;
in which he stated he was sick, I got another from my broth-&#xD;
er's widow. She wrote that he was dead."&#xD;
"Was that the last you heard, from   your relatives in&#xD;
Charleston !" I asked.&#xD;
"No.. I received a letter occasionally for several years de-&#xD;
scribing the growth of my two nieces, one of whose name was&#xD;
Margaret, and the other Mary, who was some years younger.&#xD;
than her sister, and was not born' until the year in which my&#xD;
brother died. For twenty years I have not heard a word or&#xD;
received a line from any of them. ' I wrote frequently, but no&#xD;
reply came, and I suppose they are.all dead."&#xD;
When I parted with the venerable Van Hagen, I told him&#xD;
that very probably I should at some future day, after my re-&#xD;
turn to America, visit Charleston-and in such an event I&#xD;
would diligently seek out any of his race or name, and if I&#xD;
ascertaixed that any were living, I agreed to write and inform&#xD;
him fully in reference to what so nearly concerned his family&#xD;
love.&#xD;
Years passed away before I found myself in a position to re-&#xD;
deem my promise. I had occasion to go to Charleston and&#xD;
while there had rooms at the Charleston Hotel, kept then, and&#xD;
I believe now, by a most excellent landlord 'f the name of&#xD;
Mixer.&#xD;
With his assistance I obtained a clue to the locality where&#xD;
I would probably find the relatives of my ancient'Dutch friend&#xD;
I was obliged to undertake a short journey into the country&#xD;
and to reside for some time in a spot that at certain  eriods&#xD;
of the.year is a modern Garden of Eden. Fruits and flowers&#xD;
flourish in the most luxuriant manner. Game is abundant, and&#xD;
the rivers and creeks are stocked with fish ready to bite at th&#xD;
most insignificant bait.&#xD;
I returned to Charleston, and immediately devoted my time&#xD;
for several days in writing a letter to the aged Van"ilagen in&#xD;
.Deift, Eolland. I enclosed the letter to William S. Campbell,&#xD;

&amp;amp;q., the United States Consul at Rotterdam, a city only one&#xD;
hour distant from Delft.&#xD;
After dispatching my formidable document, I left for the&#xD;
North. I had not been in New York a great while when I re-&#xD;
ceived a private letter from Consul Campbell, informing me&#xD;
that old Adam Van Hagen was dead, and had not received my&#xD;
letter.&#xD;
Luckily I kept a copy of the letter I had sent to Holland. I&#xD;
determined to re-write it in a book form. A faithful narrative&#xD;
required me to embrace the adventures of one of the descend-&#xD;
ants whose spirit of enterprise led him to New York. As a&#xD;
consequence I had to bring in other names, and use many oth..&#xD;
er matters of interest indirectly connected with one of the&#xD;
family.                 4&#xD;
I will now relate in a regular manner hat I have to say.&#xD;
But in, order to do ,so with spirit, I will commence a new&#xD;
Chapter.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
[This Chapter was written before the outbreak in 1861.],&#xD;
South Carolina and her People-Marriage of Henry' Monck to Miss Tan&#xD;
Haen-Monek's Corners -Country Fever-Birth ofMarion Monck.&#xD;
SOUTa CAROLINA was. the State in which the descendant of&#xD;
the old Holland Van Hagen was born, and who is also the&#xD;
principal hero of this narrative. The State, as hEr leading sons&#xD;
affectionately designate her, in Congress and elsewhere, has&#xD;
ever been regarded as the most aristocratic State in the Fede-&#xD;
ral Gonfederacy, and her sons and daughters as the very elite&#xD;
of the great American population. Ever the F.F.V. or "first&#xD;
families of Virginia" by general consent, back down gracefully&#xD;
and give place to an old South Carolina family. In the North,&#xD;
Southern travellers who can assert with- truth 'that they are&#xD;
South Carolinian,, hold their heads at a more lofty elevation-&#xD;
and their right to do so is never disputed.  Northern people&#xD;
cave without a murmur to South Cirolina pre-eminence.&#xD;
The actual opinion of a genuine South Carolinian of his&#xD;
State, and of him or herself, is not put on for show, while tra- t&#xD;
veiling or while conversing upon the subject.  They honestly&#xD;
believe what has the-appearance of being egotistically asserted&#xD;
&#xD;
'A&#xD;
&#xD;
-and the humiliating idea that South Carolina is not the gen-&#xD;
teel and the most powerful State 1 the Union, if not the only&#xD;
State of any account, and her population the most enlightened,&#xD;
most wealthy, most happy, most prosperous, 'and the best edu-&#xD;
cated, is never entertained for an instant in the breast or brain&#xD;
of a genuine S'outh Carolinian.&#xD;
South Carolinans are a singular and an exclusive sort of&#xD;
aristocracy. They believe in their own institutions of all&#xD;
kinds, and have a holy horror of Northerners in general. It is&#xD;
true that this Japanese sort of exclusiveness is not so intense&#xD;
as it was a few years ago.  Yankee pedlers, Northern mer-&#xD;
chaints and storekeepers have emigrated into 'South Carolina,&#xD;
made fortunes, and, in many instances made alliances- by 'mar-&#xD;
riage with some of the best blood in the State.  Both parties&#xD;
have gained by these marriages. Families of two or three&#xD;
hundred years' standing, but broken down, so far as finances&#xD;
were concerned, have been married into by men of business&#xD;
habits, literary merit, or .property qualifications, and the happy&#xD;
result has been a much healthier progeny, intellectually and&#xD;
physically, than when the descendants of the old families mar-&#xD;
ried with each other ciclusively. Such marriages have done a&#xD;
great deal also to soften the prejudices of South Carolina&#xD;
against the people of the more Northern States.&#xD;
South Carolina may be said to be divided into three parts-.&#xD;
the upper, the middle, and the lower division. In the latter&#xD;
are to be found the largest planters,'and those who own the&#xD;
greatest quantity of slaves. These planters reside near the&#xD;
banks of the Cooper and Ashley rivers, both of which pass&#xD;
Charleston on each side, and then unite and pass onward to&#xD;
the sea.&#xD;
It was on the banks of the Cooper river that my principal&#xD;
character was born.&#xD;
I have already mentioned that in the early part of the cen-&#xD;
tury, a Dutch gentleman and his wife emigrated from Delft, in&#xD;
Holland, to Charleston, South Carolina. Delft, already alluded.&#xD;
to in the introductory chapter, was farrous many years ago for'.&#xD;
its crockery. The city is located about niidway between the&#xD;
Hague and the city of Rotterdam. Martin Van Hagen, as well&#xD;
as his brother Adam, was born in an old house stretched upon&#xD;
the mainland, and directly opposite to the old church in which&#xD;
William, Prince of Orange, was assassinated.&#xD;
When Martin and his wife decided to try the United States,&#xD;
they took passage in an American ship at Rotterdam, bound&#xD;
directly for Charleston. They reached their destination-" in&#xD;

12               VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR;             is&#xD;
&#xD;
safety. Ere they had been ashore a month, Mr. Van Hagen,&#xD;
who had cash capital, had engaged in mercantile business, and&#xD;
he had also secured a small wooden dwelhng-house on the&#xD;
corner of King and Warren streets.  The building is still&#xD;
standing. In this house the family resided several years, and&#xD;
their affairs prospered. They were blessed with two daugh-&#xD;
ters. One named Margaret and the other Mary. A consider-&#xD;
able interval elapsed between the birth of the eldest and the&#xD;
youngest. Shortly after the birth of Mary the father died, and&#xD;
left a widow and two children.&#xD;
They continued to reside in the old house long after the&#xD;
father's death, but before the eldest reached the age of sixteen,&#xD;
she married a young American of the name of Henry Monck,&#xD;
and shortly after his marriage he - conveyed his bride to his&#xD;
own home on Cooper river,-in the parish of St. John Berkley,&#xD;
not far distant from the celebrated Monek's Corners, a name de-&#xD;
rived from his ancestors, one of whom emigrated from England&#xD;
at a very earlyperiod of the history of South Carolina.  The&#xD;
Henry Monck who emigrated to South Carolina was the second&#xD;
son of that English Admiral Monck, who, in 1640, fought the&#xD;
great battle that lasted three days with the Dutch Admiral&#xD;
de.Ruyter in the time of Charles the Second.  It was under&#xD;
permission of the Admiral Monck that Vandervelde, the great&#xD;
maine painter, plied between the fleets, so that he was enabled to&#xD;
represent every movement of the ships, and every material cir-&#xD;
cumstance of the action with astonishing minuteness and truth.&#xD;
But to return to young Monck.  When he married Miss Van&#xD;
Eagen he was not twenty-two years of age. His father died&#xD;
when he was very young, and by some rascality of his guar-&#xD;
dian, before he became of age he was robbed of nearly every&#xD;
negro that he had inherited at his father's death. When he&#xD;
married he was-only the owner of two negroes, a dwelling-&#xD;
house, and about three hundred and sixty acres of land. This&#xD;
quantity of paternal acres would have been a great property if&#xD;
located in some parts of the Union, but at Monck's Corners,&#xD;
where land in those days was as reasonably cheap as "seven&#xD;
pence " an acre, the value of the land only amounted to about&#xD;
forty-seven dollars.&#xD;
The dwelling-house was large and commodious, with a wide&#xD;
hall through it, and a spacious piazza in front.  All the out-&#xD;
buildings were good. The store contained about five hundred&#xD;
dollars' worth of merchandise, of a suitable and assorted char-&#xD;
aqter fpr that region, so that the young couple started on their&#xD;
mnrriage career under very favorable auspices. The lands&#xD;
&#xD;
owned by Henry Monck bordered on Cooper river, and he had&#xD;
only to seat himself in a boat, and. it would float down with the&#xD;
ebb tide to Charleston City, about thirty miles distant by wa-&#xD;
ter, The State road passed his door, and al drive of twenty-&#xD;
eight miles would take him to 0harleston by land., It was&#xD;
very easy, under such circumstances, to replenish the stock&#xD;
of goQds in his store whenever it was called for.   The&#xD;
young couple were also blessed with health, and though poor&#xD;
white people, yet they had Ao reason to envy their more pros-&#xD;
perous neighbors, the rich rice planters of Cooper river. It&#xD;
frequently happens in the state of South Carolina that.. those&#xD;
who appear to be most rich are in reality the most poor, while,&#xD;
on the contrary, those who are comparatively poor, but out of&#xD;
debt, are the most independent. Our agricultural readers will&#xD;
be somewhat astonished with the information that ridh lands,&#xD;
teeming with luxuriant vegetation, located both by land and&#xD;
water within thirty miles of the queen- city of the south, should&#xD;
ever have been at. low a figure as twelve and a half cents the&#xD;
acre. Yet such has been the fact, and even, now, fifty-four&#xD;
years later, rich lands, capable, by proper attention, of produ-&#xD;
cing as valuable crop as are made on the best land on Long Is-&#xD;
land, and valued at five hundred dollars the acre, can be&#xD;
bought for one dollar and fifty cents to two dollars an acre, with&#xD;
a dwelling-house upon them. But Northern farmers, although&#xD;
well aware that rich lands are to be had in South Carolina at a&#xD;
very low figure, refuse to emigrate to South Carolina'as they&#xD;
do. to Virginia, because-not slavery-but the country fever.&#xD;
It is worse than yellow fever,'African fever, or any other fever&#xD;
but itself. It is a scourge-a terrible scourge, and wo to "a&#xD;
Northerner or Southerner who places himself in the way of&#xD;
country fever. If he takes it, and escapes with his life, it&#xD;
breaks his constitution forever. Our readers have got so far&#xD;
this tale as where Henry Monck carried his bride up to&#xD;
Monek's Corners. They were married in December, and at&#xD;
that season the country in the neighborhood of Charleston is a&#xD;
paradise. The bride was delighted with her new home, and&#xD;
all went on pleasantly and prosperously with the new couple&#xD;
until the month of August of the year, succeeding their mar-&#xD;
riage. When May came, Ilenry told his wife of the danger&#xD;
that she would injur by residing on their place in the summer&#xD;
months, and proposed that they should go into the Pine lands&#xD;
some  en miles distant, and. there erect a log cabin for their&#xD;
resid noe in the summer nights.. Re told her that he did not&#xD;

would go to the Pine region before sundown and spend. the&#xD;
night there, returning to the plantation and store in the morning,&#xD;
after the dew had been driven off the grass by the rays of the&#xD;
sun. So they arranged matters, and for weeks and months un-&#xD;
til far into the summer they left their dwelling before sunset&#xD;
to go to the log hut in the Pine region, and there escaped the&#xD;
danger of the miasma worse than that of the pontine, marshes.&#xD;
Mrs. Monek enjoyed excellent health, and could scarcely credit&#xD;
the horrible but truthful stories she heard related of the im-&#xD;
mediate effects of the country fever. When told of Mr. Smith,&#xD;
who had accidentally been caught ont at night, and slept in&#xD;
the woods, only succeeded by the- long sleep that knows no&#xD;
waking-it seemed to her a dream. When told that to sleep,&#xD;
unless a, large fire was kept burning all night, was certain&#xD;
death, she could not credit it; and finally, as the summer&#xD;
passed into autumn, and it became necessary to use extra ex-&#xD;
ertions to get in the crops of their small farm, which was cu.l-&#xD;
tivated by her husband and the two old negroes Phillis and&#xD;
Toney that remained out of the wreck of his property, she&#xD;
found it, so inconvenient to go to and- fro night and morn-&#xD;
ing between the two places, she told her husband that she did&#xD;
not believe there was any danger, and refused to leave her&#xD;
dwelling to go any more to their low cabin in the pine woods.&#xD;
He'begged her to wait until the "black frost " came, the only&#xD;
sure remedy or preventative of South Carolina country fever.&#xD;
No.. Before September closed she had it, and though it ran&#xD;
nine .days before it was broken, yet she recovered, after&#xD;
months of suffering.&#xD;
On the' second of December, 1814, a year after their mai&#xD;
riage, Mrs. Monok gave birth to a son.&#xD;
She ,a.d visited with her husband the grave of General Ma-&#xD;
ion, in St.Stephen's Parish, had been-over the grounds where&#xD;
he had fought his battles, and she insisted that her child should&#xD;
be baptized in Biggin Church, famous in revolutionary history,&#xD;
and that he should be named after the hero of whom she had&#xD;
heard so much; and so the boy-was baptized by the Rev. Mr.&#xD;
Howe as&#xD;
MARIoN MONCK."&#xD;
He was an only child, and father, mother and son vegetated&#xD;
at Monok's Corners, with more or less prosperity every year,&#xD;
until Marion had reached his eighth year.&#xD;

CHAPTER IH.&#xD;
oung Monck's Boyhood-Jack Bird and Mr. yegro Black-Wild Turkey&#xD;
Funding and Fishing.&#xD;
WrE Marion Monek was eight years old, like other south-&#xD;
ern boys, he was capable of playing almost the game in life of&#xD;
a man. He could hunt, fish, ride a - horse, or drive a team,&#xD;
and was a great favorite not only of his own relations, but of&#xD;
many of their neighbors. Some of these became Marion's -in&#xD;
structors in all manly arts. One of the names of these men&#xD;
was Jack Bird. He was a fine specimen of a man. His age.&#xD;
was over 60, and he stood. six feet and a half without boots,&#xD;
and his frame was we proportioned. He could neither read&#xD;
nor write, but he would secure more wild turkeys and deer in&#xD;
twenty-four hours than any other man in South Carolina. Jack&#xD;
was a fair specimen of many poor white people. His den or&#xD;
cabin was in the Pine woods, some three miles from the, Santee&#xD;
canal, and there he kept his wife and eleven children, all grow-&#xD;
ing up inthe' ways of old Jack. Jack Bird owned no cows, or&#xD;
hogs, or poultry. Why should he? - His neighbors on Cooper&#xD;
river owned large herds, and -.well, Jack could steal as many&#xD;
as he needed for home consumption, or as he 'could safely sell.&#xD;
Marion 'had always been an immense favorite of Jack's,and&#xD;
although the position in life of Mr. Monek was several degrees&#xD;
above that of Jack Bird, yet the latter did not envy or injure&#xD;
him, and would have gone some distance out of his way to&#xD;
have done Mr. Monck or his wife a service. The mother re-&#xD;
'paid Jack for all his kindness to her son, 'by givig him choice&#xD;
bits of tobacco occasionally out of the store, and he frequently&#xD;
returned the compliment by leaving her a fat wild' turkey, a&#xD;
-brace of wild ducks, or when[ these were scarce, a- dozen&#xD;
pigeons, partridges,.or robms. Whoever else Jack Bird plun-&#xD;
dered was of no consequence-lie left the denizens of Monek's&#xD;
Corners unmolested, and they were grateful whenever occasion&#xD;
offered.&#xD;
Charleston -people frequently visited Mouck's Corners to&#xD;
have a hunt, and -Jack was always to pioneer on such occa-&#xD;
sions'; but wo to any unlucky favorite pen-knife, .peneil4egse,&#xD;
or fish-hook that fell in his way! It was sure to be missing if&#xD;
it took the fancy of six-foot Jack.&#xD;

VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jack had trained Marion until he had become one of the&#xD;
best wild turkey hunters in the parish. He could discover,&#xD;
with little trouble, where the wild turkeys came to feed. He.&#xD;
would then prepare a biding-place in the neighborhood, and&#xD;
fix a gunk loaded, so as to command a reach of ten or twenty&#xD;
feet in a trench by the side of a log. This trench he would&#xD;
bait with corn, and' then trail the corn off in several directions&#xD;
to places where the wild turkeys would be likely to see it. A&#xD;
day or two only would pass when Marion would discover that&#xD;
the turkeys had found the trench and had ate the corn. This&#xD;
he would refill, and so do every morning forta.week, until the&#xD;
turkeys had made aregnlar business of crowding the' trench.&#xD;
Then Marion would selectt a particular morning, go early to his&#xD;
hide, and conceal himself, with the barrels of his duck gun&#xD;
loaded with buck-shot, bearing directly upon the track. Bye-&#xD;
and-bye he hears a noise-m--one, two, twelve, twenty, fifty wild&#xD;
but unsuspecting turkeys arrive--they jump over, and on, and&#xD;
around eaich other, to get at the corn. Marion quietly pulls&#xD;
one, and then the other trigger--bang, bang! Some turkeys&#xD;
get off, but nearly all remain. Twenty-eight are dead, and,&#xD;
Marion. goes home for a negro-g-Toney and the one horse cart&#xD;
to convey his spoil bome..&#xD;
Another especial friend of Marion Monk's was Negro&#xD;
Black. His original naie. was John Black; but besides being&#xD;
a popr white man, a hunter and day laborer, he 'added to his&#xD;
slender income by catching negroes. Ience his nick-name of&#xD;
gro Black, by-which he was known not only throughout St.&#xD;
John Berkeley, but by mapy planters in other section, who.&#xD;
had runaway negroes to.catch. Like Dick Bird, he had a wife&#xD;
and eight or ten white-headed children. Mr. Black had one&#xD;
source of revenue,, and it wAs, always a sure and profitable one.&#xD;
It arose from successful h ning wild cats. When a prowl-&#xD;
ng wd cat made 'the fact apparent that he was in the neigh-&#xD;
borhood, by catching up chickens or small pigs, the planter&#xD;
upon whose premises the, animal had made a demonstration&#xD;
was.,seen-to dispatch a summons to Mr. Negro iBlack.&#xD;
It is a very curious fadt in respect. to the habits of a wild&#xD;
cat, that when he approaches a plantation, or rather the dwell-&#xD;
ings on a plantation, where his designs lay, whether it be to&#xD;
catch poultry, chickens or pigs, he goes to work in a. regular,&#xD;
seientifi business manner. The, cat exhibits no greediness.&#xD;
If he lights upon an old sow that has a litter of elevenor more&#xD;
nice little delicate pigs, wild kitty con mn veswith using up&#xD;
one a day, and no inducement of appetite can foree him to in-&#xD;
&#xD;
grease the quantity.. If no discovery is made by the ownerof&#xD;
tqe poor old sow, at the end of the eleventh day she is pigless&#xD;
Tle instant the overseer discovered by the regularity of the&#xD;
thefts that a wild cat was about, he sent for Negro Black.&#xD;
Perhaps it took one, two or three days, but Negro Black was&#xD;
a sure coffin for the cat. He and his dog Victor never failed.&#xD;
The eat was a doomed cat, and Mr. Negro Black received the&#xD;
skin and $10 as his fee for the operation. Negro Black had a'&#xD;
jealousy of Jack Bird, and he maintained that the mode Jack&#xD;
had of catching wild turkeys, by a hide, was deliberate mur-&#xD;
der. It gave the turkeys no show.; and he taught Marion&#xD;
anotherdethod. At a certain season, when the wild turkeys&#xD;
get scattered, he would go into the woods with Marion, and&#xD;
pile up a lot of brush wood.&#xD;
"Get behind that with your gun, pull the brush wood over&#xD;
you, and use the whistle."&#xD;
It was many days before Marion succeeded in. shooting a&#xD;
solitary wild turkey; and even before that event took place,&#xD;
Negro Black's patience' became quite exhausted ;-for while&#xD;
Marjon's gun was idte, and not a wild turkey would come nigh&#xD;
him in answer to his whistle, Negro Black would be ,off in .&#xD;
different part of the woods, and kill several. At last he broke&#xD;
out-&#xD;
"Why you no whistle as I do, when you go for catch wid&#xD;
turkey'?  Take your whistle a-d blow leetle bit-turkey hear&#xD;
him..-wait-no blow again until you hear tarkey answer-theP&#xD;
0blow a leetle harder-wait-turkey answer again-then blow&#xD;
one soft, slow blow, and don't blow any more. Wait-wturkey&#xD;
come bye-and-bye sure-den pop him. Turkey like young&#xD;
girl. If young manwant take young girl for his wife, he give&#xD;
one call-little girl don't answer-it no use. Young man hab&#xD;
patience and wait. Bye-and-bye little girl make reply. Young&#xD;
man call again-wait until the young girl emne, like tui--&#xD;
key, and say, 'I'm yours.'&#xD;
Another and a third mode of killing wild turkeys, taught&#xD;
Marion by his hunter teachers, was to watch in the woods to&#xD;
hear where they roosted. Ile would hear a turkey fly at sun-&#xD;
down, and very soon would- trace a flock. If it was moonlight&#xD;
Marion would go for his gun, and four or five turkeys would be&#xD;
his reward. Or if it was very dark, he would wait patiently&#xD;
for the first glimmering of daylight, and then 'pop off a few ti-&#xD;
keys before they had left. the "turkey robust.&#xD;

tiibes as at Monck's Corners ?  Hours, day and night, Mario'&#xD;
used to spend on the banksof the .Biggin creek,,or on the sid0&#xD;
of the old Santee canal. Sometimes with a small "dip net N'e&#xD;
would catch one, two or four shad, as they dashed up to th '&#xD;
waste way of the canal, and in the months of February, Marib,&#xD;
April and May, with the hook and line, in Biggin creek; he&#xD;
would catch trout of the size of eleven pounds, rock fish, perch,&#xD;
brise, catfish, and mullet by the million. 0, such sport as he&#xD;
had in these. well-filled waters. Every fish that belongs to&#xD;
salt or fresh water is caught in the Biggin creek, or bantee&#xD;
canal, when the tide is running in or out. Thousands of nights&#xD;
could Marion have been found with his dip net on the hank of&#xD;
the Biggin creek, the whole scene made as -light as day by the&#xD;
"light wood " bonfires, and sometimes he and his companions&#xD;
wohld- be thus engaged, with more or less luck, until daybreak.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
Marion's Education.-Death of Grandmother-Aunt'sgorrival at AoF's obr-&#xD;
ners-the Store-Negro Customers.&#xD;
WHILE Mariont Monck, by violent exercise, was developing&#xD;
his physical powers, his mental were neglected, so far as edu-&#xD;
cation was concerned, during these years of child and boy-&#xD;
hood, or until, he was over ten years of age. At that time he&#xD;
hid not acquired the first Jetter of the alphabet.  His grand-&#xD;
mother came up from Charleston occasionally to spend a few&#xD;
days, but our youth never returned to town with her.  About&#xD;
this period, the grandmother, who had came over from Hol-&#xD;
land with her husband, died in the city of Charleston.  Her&#xD;
remains were taken to Monck's Corners for interment. So soon&#xD;
as her affairs were settled, the 'eldest daughter left Charles-&#xD;
ton and went to. Monck's Corners to reside permanently with&#xD;
her sister, Miss Monck. This event had a very important&#xD;
bearing upon the education of Marion.  She was a very intel-&#xD;
ligent lady, had reading many books, and possessed a very&#xD;
general knowledge of what it was now highly important that&#xD;
yugMonk should know&#xD;
The Aun found in her nephew, a well developed handsomne&#xD;
boy, capable of leading in any manly enterprise, and accom-&#xD;
plished in all manly sports. In place of A 13 C, he knew the&#xD;
number of every fish hook ; if he had no knowledge of grammar&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
he could ride a horse, and join in a deer hunt., -If he -had no&#xD;
knowledge of geography, he knew every spot where game&#xD;
could be scared up, and for arithmetic he could catch fish and&#xD;
game to an extent that even David could not have counted.&#xD;
In a word, he could ride, drive, hunt, fish, or swim equal to&#xD;
any man in St. John's Parish, if thrice his age.  He was in-&#xD;
telligent, could talk well on many and moot subjects, his -in&#xD;
formation having been derived from the conversation with&#xD;
others.. His aunt,-who regarded a good education as every.&#xD;
thing in life, became very much alarmed at finding a nephew&#xD;
ten years of age who could neither read or write. She deter-&#xD;
mined to remedy what she regarded as a degrading evil.&#xD;
Marion felt that it would at least be convenient to read at&#xD;
last, and' willingly, became a prompt pupil to his aunt.  His&#xD;
progress was very rapid, for he had au iron memory. The&#xD;
A, B, C, was soon acquired, and flight and day- did he, devote&#xD;
to learning, until he could read anything, wrote a plain hand,&#xD;
could "do " any sum in Daboll's arithmetic, and had Murray's&#xD;
grammar by heart. Moore's geography was soon mastered,&#xD;
and Marion had acquired at least as good a foundation in use-&#xD;
ful and necessary learning, as is given in the District schools&#xD;
of the North. ' It is needless to add -that he' had- acquired&#xD;
from his mother and aunt the Dutch language, and as his*&#xD;
teachings from the aunt were partly in that language, he could&#xD;
read and speak it as well as he, could' English.  His fatlier&#xD;
devoted most of his time to the plantation, and to raising&#xD;
horses, cattle and hogs. His mother superintended the house-&#xD;
hold matters, and also attended to the stoie.  When Marion&#xD;
vas able write and reckon, he became of vast. service to his&#xD;
mother, and spent a great portion of his time in the store, and&#xD;
when customers were rare, he 'had a book in his hand.  He&#xD;
literally learned it by heart, and what "he knew,he' knew.&#xD;
He continued until he was nearly fourteen years old.  The&#xD;
store was guite an affair. The stock of goods was limited, and&#xD;
articles were bought in Charleston once a month, or ordered by&#xD;
letter. The maze consisted of coarse dry goods, bacoa, coffee,&#xD;
sugar, rice, whiskey, tobacco, pipes, cigars, crockery, soap,&#xD;
lead, butter, spices, tin buckets, and coarse wooden ware.&#xD;
The customers were in part the poor white folks, and second&#xD;
the negroes from the'adjoinig plantations.  Fifteen thousand&#xD;
negroes.at least, looked to that store for their little luxuries,&#xD;
and the happitiess that this store conferred, can hardly be re-&#xD;
alized. Here, sometimes, the slave would come at miniught,&#xD;
having travelled ten miles, with ten more to go before he got&#xD;

back again to his home, and perhaps he would have- walked&#xD;
all the distance to get a "f6urpence " worth of tobacco4or his&#xD;
little bag of corn. When he got it, he was a happy fellow.&#xD;
Sometimes forty or fifty would come together, and   then&#xD;
some care and caution had to be exercised, for in sueh a force&#xD;
in the store at one time, the temptation to steal was too great&#xD;
to be resisted. Each took his turn, while the rest remained&#xD;
outside. -'Marion became quite a favorite with these neg'oes,&#xD;
and it was really a pleasure to him-to get up and wait upon a&#xD;
tired customer even for the most trivial article. The pay was&#xD;
in corn.  Sometimes the negro had received money for -his,&#xD;
corn, and then he had cash. If it was a bill of five or ten&#xD;
dollars, the slave asked it to be changed into silver, and when&#xD;
that was done, he knew what he was about, and trade com-&#xD;
menced. "How Much for da4 tin biggin ?"&#xD;
"Seven pence."&#xD;
"I tax um," and the quarter would be handed in by the&#xD;
purchaser, and then change given. Trade would then com.&#xD;
mance again.&#xD;
"How much you ax for dat spider ?"&#xD;
"Quarter dollar."&#xD;
"Quatah. dollah. I gib ten pence for him."&#xD;
"Take it."  Pay and take change again.&#xD;
"Gib me one and ninepence worth of tobacco."&#xD;
And so trade goes on, paying for every article as he buys it,&#xD;
from a dollar's worth of homespun to a cent cigar, and per.&#xD;
haps he goes to the plantation where he belongs loaded with&#xD;
small things-and no father of a family, or piatronesses of.&#xD;
Stewart in New York, ever enjoyed spending money so much&#xD;
as these slaves. If it was corn he brought to trade wpith, then'&#xD;
he had it-measured. Suppose it was two bushels. The price&#xD;
has been seventy-five cents, and never varies in the negro&#xD;
trade if corn is worth in Charleston only fifty cents or a dollar.&#xD;
Then he pays for his goods with corn-a peck, four quarts, two&#xD;
quarts, as the case or price may be of the article bought, and&#xD;
never makes a blunder.&#xD;
Now and then two negroes are in partnership, or some negro&#xD;
who could not come, has sent his corn by a friend. The bearer&#xD;
of the corn for another gets what is wanted,-and never mixes it&#xD;
up with his-own transactions. How it is done, no bookkeeper&#xD;
in a bank could tell. Sometimes in financial transactions the&#xD;
red corncob is used as a matter of security. One negro owes&#xD;
another.. They deposit a rede corncob in the hands of .a third&#xD;
party as an evidence of money loaned or a debt due. The per-.&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
21&#xD;
&#xD;
son who receives this corncob never gives it. up until the debt&#xD;
is paid or cancelled, and then it is done in the presence of the&#xD;
two parties interested. It is a sort of red corncob bond and&#xD;
mortgage, and the parties can't get over it. It is rarely set&#xD;
aside, even by podr white people.&#xD;
The attachment of the negroes to this store was wonderful.&#xD;
It was what they looked forward to, when they had cash or&#xD;
corn, as a great blessing in their existence. As an evitience&#xD;
of this, when Marion' was ab'ut twelve years old, the family&#xD;
were woke up about two o'clock one morning, by a bright-blaze.&#xD;
The store was on fire--and in less than two hoursobeing, built&#xD;
of pitch pine, it was in ashes. Five thousand negroes were on&#xD;
the ground before it finished burning, and then came sympathy&#xD;
and anxiety for it to be rebuilt, The negroes for two weeks&#xD;
poured in from all quarters at odd hours which were their own.&#xD;
Carpenters from all the plantations volunteered. Others went&#xD;
into the woods with axes, and  ut down trees, and hewed them&#xD;
into their proper size.&#xD;
Before two weeks had passed the store was rebuilt again,&#xD;
twice its former size; and when it would have cost, under ordi-&#xD;
nary circumstances, four hundred dollars to rebuild it, it did&#xD;
not cost Mr. Monck fifty dollars--and then it was for nails, and&#xD;
things the negroes could not furnish. When it was ready. to&#xD;
receive goods, Mr. Monck went to Charleston and bought them,&#xD;
and when the store was re-opened again, there was as general&#xD;
a rejoicing among fifteen thousand negroes and negre'ses,&#xD;
young and old, as if each one had had an individual interest in&#xD;
the affair. It was a "want."  They missed it. It was their&#xD;
place of resort for luxury and comfort, and they could not get&#xD;
along without it. The dark lover, when he was about to wed&#xD;
a darkey bride, could get the rings at the store, and a battle of&#xD;
cologne, a comb, papers of pins, or any little article, that, when&#xD;
purchased, gave more real happiness than a thousand dolr&#xD;
shawl in other circles of society:&#xD;

sand'and one objects of human ambition, is a serious matter.&#xD;
Long and earnestly had, Marion Monek communed with him-&#xD;
self, and dreamed by day as well as by night of his future.&#xD;
His mind was made up to leave home. Young as he was, he&#xD;
knew and felt that his father, his family and himself could only&#xD;
-hold a second rate position in white society. He could not&#xD;
rank or associate on an equality with the rich planter, and he&#xD;
was somewhat in advance- of the poor white class. He was&#xD;
occupying a sort of mongrel white rank, betwixt and between&#xD;
'the two white extremes. Marion felt within himself 'that, he&#xD;
had talentind genius,,and it urged him on to seek a larger&#xD;
field.&#xD;
At last he gained the consent of his parents that he should&#xD;
leave home, and seek an occupation elsewhere, where he could&#xD;
see and learn more of the world. Worthy'Mr. Monck wished&#xD;
his son to seek employment with some merchant iii Charleston,&#xD;
as he honestly thought that Marion's experience in the store&#xD;
at Monck's Corners would have been a, good preparatory school&#xD;
for a merchant's coutting-room. Marion promised that in six&#xD;
months-he would come back and see them--perhaps sooner.&#xD;
The mother packed his trunk, placing a Bible in a-flannel shirt&#xD;
carefully, gave her son a few crying kisses, and Mr, Monck&#xD;
drove off with him en route for Charleston. On their arrival&#xD;
at their destination Mr. Monck found quarters for Marion with&#xD;
a friend, and the same day started on his return home.&#xD;
Charleston was then, is now, and will be fifty years hence&#xD;
the' same Charleston. The quicksand bar is still there, shift.&#xD;
ing and changing about-.the old houses grow a little older.-&#xD;
the mass of the old wooden tenements gets thicker and more&#xD;
impervious every year-the bell to call. in. the negroes rings&#xD;
at a quarter to nine, and the drum beats at the guard-house at&#xD;
a quarter to ten, to say that all negroes' out after that hour&#xD;
without a pass from their masters, if they are slaves, or from&#xD;
their. guardians, if they are free, will be locked up in the&#xD;
guard-house for the night, and taken before the Mayor in the&#xD;
morning. The yellow fever makes its appearance every two&#xD;
or three years, just when the Charleston-people, because it has&#xD;
missed a year, have begun to indulge the hope that it will keep&#xD;
away five years, and give their favorite city a chance to loom&#xD;
-up in the commercial world. But no-it seems almost hope-&#xD;
les;. and the dread of yellow fever is like an incubus upon&#xD;
the city, and it is doubtful whether it will ever be taken off.&#xD;
For more than a week Marion Monok roamed about Charles-.&#xD;
ton, seeking employment in some commercial business. Per-&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.23&#xD;
haps it was lucky for him that he found no vacancy. No one&#xD;
wanted a clerk of his size, shape or make. One beautiful&#xD;
morning he wandered down about the wharves, and was admir-&#xD;
ing a stately ship. She was loading for New York. The idea&#xD;
flashed across his mind whether his chances would not be bet.&#xD;
ter in New York than in Charleston. He answered it by&#xD;
going on board and ascertaining'the price of passage. It was&#xD;
within his means, and would still leave him something in his&#xD;
pocket to keep afloat a few days in New York. The ship was&#xD;
to sail the next day. Her name was the Saluda, and her com-&#xD;
mander was the man who hadAraded so lIng between Charles-&#xD;
ton and New York,. that in the latter place he is known by no&#xD;
other name than the Charleston "Berry."  Long ago he left&#xD;
the ship line, and has built and commanded every steamer that&#xD;
has voyaged from Charleston to New York. May he command&#xD;
steamers between the two cities for a thousand years more!&#xD;
Marion returned from A4ger's wharf to the house where he&#xD;
boarded, and announced to the worthy Mrs. Ferguson, the land-&#xD;
lady, that he had half made. up his mind to put out for New&#xD;
York the next day.&#xD;
"Who do you know there, young Monck?" was her imme-&#xD;
diate question.&#xD;
"Nobody.&#xD;
" Indeed! And pray how will you get along without being&#xD;
acquainted with anybody or somebody ?"&#xD;
Marion reflected, and replied, "Well, I have had no success&#xD;
to my wishes in this town, where I do know a great many peo.&#xD;
ple, who knows but that I may find a situation among-those&#xD;
who don't know me or that I don't know ?"&#xD;
And quick as lightning, the idea made him decide* to go to&#xD;
New York; and he told the worthy lady, in the most flat-&#xD;
footed and decided manner that he should embark for New&#xD;
York in the good ship Saluda, Captain Berry, the next day.&#xD;
"Well, my brave boy, if you will go, I will give you one&#xD;
letter that may be of service to you. I have a .niece in New&#xD;
York who is married to a merchant there. She is a Charles.&#xD;
tonian, named Bessy Nordheim, and will give a helping hand,&#xD;
if need be, to a South Carolina boy."&#xD;
Marion expressed his thanks, and immediately-returned to&#xD;
the ship and paid his passage. That night his landlady wrote&#xD;
the letter, and he placed it carefully in his trunk., The next&#xD;
morning, bright and 'early, he and his trunk were on board the,&#xD;
Saluda, and before meridian the ship had passed over the bar,&#xD;
bouad to New York.&#xD;

It is useless tq give a description of a sea voyage of eight&#xD;
days' duration. Marion was intensely sea-sick for t*o days,&#xD;
and it did him more good than fifty boxes of Brandreth's pills&#xD;
would havedone. On the afternoon of the eighth day, the&#xD;
ship Saluda was moored alongside the dock in Burling Slip,&#xD;
and Marion hired a cartman, and with his' trunk proceeded to&#xD;
a boarding house in Liberty street near Greenwich, to which'&#xD;
I j     he had been recommended by a fellow passenger.It was&#xD;
nearly dark when he got fairly established in his room, and&#xD;
after he had taken a boarding-house tea, he did the most sen-&#xD;
sible thing,a young stranger who made his first visit could do&#xD;
at night, viz., he went to bed.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
Marion Monck in New York-Pretents his Letter of Introduction-Procures&#xD;
a situation with Granville and Nordheim-Home of Mr. Nordheim, in Bond&#xD;
$4treet.-The Character of the Wife.&#xD;
HEN Marion arose from his bed on the morning after his&#xD;
arrival, his head was so confused by the multiplicity of noises&#xD;
which he hld listened to from long before daybreak, that he&#xD;
could with difficulty comprehend where he really was. But at&#xD;
last his lonesome position, in a strange city, broke with full&#xD;
force upon bis mind,. He thought of hi. distant home and&#xD;
loving parents, and cried. He could not hplp it. He was in&#xD;
a great city, without one solitary' friend. Bye-and-bye he&#xD;
dressed himself, descended to the breakfastroom, and after&#xD;
drinking a cup of strong coffee, felt, decidedly better, and much&#xD;
more energetic than he had felt since he left Monck's Corners.&#xD;
The landlady cautioned him agaist getting lost, as soon as&#xD;
Marion told her that he had ever been in the city before, and&#xD;
he started out to try his fortune in New York.. e wandere&#xD;
about until dinner-time, starig at the million of novelties that&#xD;
his eye encountered, and then he returned home, and went at&#xD;
once to hig trunk to get the letter of introduction that his&#xD;
Charlestom landlady had given him. ilehad hardly looked at&#xD;
the address before, but now he regarded it as of some impor-&#xD;
tance. It was directed to a.house in Bond street, and he found&#xD;
his way up there, and before five o'clock in the afternoon he&#xD;
had presented the letter of introduction to the lady, to 'whom&#xD;
it was addressed. She received him in a very cordial man-&#xD;
ner, insisted that he should stay to tea, and become acquainted&#xD;
&#xD;

VIGOR.&#xD;
with her husband, Mr. Nordheim, who, she said, had resided&#xD;
in Charleston some time, and who was engaged in a large busi-&#xD;
ness in Broad street. Marion felt that there was a hope, and&#xD;
desiBd sMeetN dh                                tn&#xD;
so he did as Mrs. Nordheim wished.&#xD;
It was nearly half-past seven before the husband came home,&#xD;
and then the wife introduced Marion, and showed the letter&#xD;
from her Charleston relative. Mr. Nordheim was very cor-&#xD;
dial, and joined his wife when she insisted that Marion should&#xD;
take tea with them and spend the evening. It was Dot long&#xD;
before Marion discovered that Ferdinand Nordheim was an&#xD;
Israelite,&#xD;
. Conversation turned upon Marion's prospects; and when he&#xD;
stated that he was anxious to get a situation i a counting-room&#xD;
or store, Mr. Nordheim observed that the firm of Granville and&#xD;
Nordheim, of which he was a partner, wanted a clerk. 4 I&#xD;
leave these matters to my partner," said he; "but in this&#xD;
case, if you will meet me at my store at ten o'clock to-morrow&#xD;
morning, I willmake you acquainted with my ~partner, Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville, and I dare say some arrangement satisfactory to you&#xD;
may be made. I will tell him how I became acquainted with&#xD;
you, and your own rather prepossessing appearance must do&#xD;
the rest. If he is willing to engage you in our service, I shall&#xD;
niakeno objection; on the contrary, I will willingly employ&#xD;
you".t.e.&#xD;
The heart of Marion beat quick-and after the evening meal&#xD;
was concluded, Mr. Nordheim, that tiere might be no mistake,&#xD;
wrote down the address, "Granville and Nordheim, corner of&#xD;
Broad and Garden street," and Marion took his leave.&#xD;
At precisely ten o'clock he was in the counting-room of Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim. That gentleman introduced him to Mr. Granville&#xD;
with such explanations as were necessary, and Mr. Granville&#xD;
Sed the way into his private office. After cross-questioning&#xD;
Marion for some time, he appeared to be quite satisfied asato&#xD;
his capability, and observed "It will take some time before&#xD;
you can be of much service, but you.look is though you would&#xD;
try an  learn fast; and although itr is not customary with&#xD;
heavy houses to pay any salary for two or thi'ee-years--"( Ma-&#xD;
rion was all aghast)-don7t be alarmed ; in your case, under&#xD;
the circumstances, we will vary from the custom, and give you&#xD;
a salary the first year. What will it cost ou to live here&#xD;
Marion had no idea. Supposed he could board for one or&#xD;
two dollars a week.&#xD;
Mr. Granville smiled.&#xD;
"Probably four or five dollars will be nearer the mark.&#xD;

thorough knowledge of the business meanwhile. Are you&#xD;
satisfied9"&#xD;
" Perfectly, and am very thankful," said poor Marion.&#xD;
"Very well-then come with me." And he left his private&#xD;
office for "the general counting-room, where seven or eight&#xD;
clerks seemed to be very busy. He addressed an elderly&#xD;
clerk :&#xD;
"Mr. Wilson, this youig gentleman will come into our office&#xD;
to-morrow. His name is Marion Monck. You must try and&#xD;
make something of him."&#xD;
Mr. Wilson bowed, and after having given some instruction&#xD;
to Marion as to the hour next day when he would be expected,&#xD;
went on writing his books. Marion quietly took his departure,&#xD;
and went at once to his room, and wrote a letter to his father&#xD;
and mother. The next day he was regularly installed as a&#xD;
clerk with Granville and Nordheim.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson, the bookkeeper, explained to him his duties,&#xD;
and stated that as he was the junior clerk, it would be neces-&#xD;
sary for him to commence at the bottom of the ladder, and&#xD;
work his way up. He was obliged to open the store, put the&#xD;
books in the safe at night, lock it up, and give the key to the&#xD;
bookkeeper, and stay and see the porter shut up the store at&#xD;
night. He was also post-office clerk, had to go with letters to&#xD;
the office, and bring all letters in Box 910 to the office of Gran.&#xD;
ville and Nordheim. Marion went through the first day with&#xD;
real satisfaction to himself and his employers. His modest&#xD;
willingness to do anything that he was called upon to do, had&#xD;
already secured to him the good feeling of the bookkeeper and&#xD;
tht other clerks.&#xD;
The store was closed before dark the first day. In fact, such&#xD;
was the usual habit, except on "packet nights," and then 'it&#xD;
was kept open until ten or eleven o'clock. Marion received&#xD;
the keys from the porter, and proceeded to his home, No. 119&#xD;
Liberty street. He told his success to the landlady, Mrs.&#xD;
]Birch, and she congratulated him warmly, adding, " You owe&#xD;
much to the lady who received you so kindly, and who was the&#xD;
means of procuring you the place. I have known young lads&#xD;
wait months to get a situation, and then not so good a one as&#xD;
you have .secured in two days. Have you been up town to.&#xD;
thank the kind lady in Bond street ?" .&#xD;
&#xD;
27&#xD;
&#xD;
Marion replied t  he had not.&#xD;
"Then you, out to go at once. Gratitude costs but little&#xD;
in your case."&#xD;
These few words set Marion to thinking. He was merely a&#xD;
clerk. Was it right to go and pay av isit at the private resi-&#xD;
dence of his emp   r ? "Well," thiOght Marion, "she asked&#xD;
me kindly to calf when I got fixed in a place. I am fixed, and&#xD;
through her kindness. I will go up and see and thank her to-&#xD;
night."  An hour afterwards he was on the steps of a large&#xD;
three story brick house in Bond street, and had pulled the&#xD;
bell-knob. A- neggo woman came to the door and opened it.&#xD;
"Is Mr. Nordheim at home ?"&#xD;
No-Massa ain't come in yet. Missis is in.&#xD;
Go and tell her Marion Monck would like to see her."&#xD;
In a moment Mrs. Nordheim herself came out of the parlor,&#xD;
and taking Marion by the hand, led him back into it, and&#xD;
placed him by her side on a luxurious sofa.&#xD;
"Well, what luck, Marion ?"&#xD;
"Thanks to you, dear lady, I am engaged for four years by&#xD;
your husband's firm-but has he not told you ? -&#xD;
"He-my husband-do. I have not -seen him since morn-&#xD;
ing. Sometimes I do not see him for two or three days and&#xD;
nights together "-and noticing Marion8s look of aatonshment,&#xD;
she added, "He has so much- to. do at times, and frequently&#xD;
has to visit neighboring cities on business-but never mind&#xD;
him. I am so glad you have come up'to-night. I want 'to&#xD;
talk to you about Charleston-about your home and parents,&#xD;
and South Carolina matters generally. But you must have&#xD;
some tea "-and she jumped up, and pulled the bell. It was&#xD;
answered by another negro girl, who took the order.&#xD;
Marion again thanked her for being the means of getting&#xD;
him a place, and told her that she did not know how happy it&#xD;
had made him-that but for her he should have had a wretch..&#xD;
ed, anxious time of it. "And: you must tell me how to show&#xD;
my gratitude,'' he added.                       /&#xD;
Again she took both of his hands in her own delicate white&#xD;
ones, and pressed them closely., "Say no more about it. I&#xD;
need just such a friend as you will be, and if you are grateful,&#xD;
as you say, you will be able to do a thousand kndnesses for:&#xD;
me. You must come here as often as you can. I am'sadly in&#xD;
want of a beau; and as you are so young, and froni my own&#xD;
State too, I am sure Mr. Nordheim will not be jealous of you,&#xD;
and will letme go out with you for an escort wheneverlI&#xD;
please. It is very rare now that he goes out with me himself,"&#xD;

The ice was broken, and before the "'as served they&#xD;
were chatting as familiarly as a couple d ildren-and, in&#xD;
truth, they were both children.&#xD;
"How old are you, larion ?" she asked.&#xD;
"I was fou teen last peond of Decemher, and it is April&#xD;
now,-Mrs. Nordheim."&#xD;
There, stop-don't Oll me Mrs. Nordteim-say Bessy,&#xD;
and I shill like it andyoV a great deal better."&#xD;
Marion laughed, and added, "Well, Bessy, how old are you?",&#xD;
Guess."&#xD;
" 'cannot. You are married, and "--&#xD;
"Very well. I am just two. years older than your most&#xD;
venerable self, Master Marion. I am but sixteen now---just&#xD;
old enough to be your loving elder ,sister." And with one&#xD;
hand pressed around Marion, with the other she parted the&#xD;
dark brown hair on his white forehead, and pressed it with a&#xD;
pure, loving kiss. "Now, that christens you my brother'," she&#xD;
playfully added. "And this," said Marion, throwing one arm&#xD;
fondly about her neck, and putting his lips to 'hers, "makes&#xD;
you my loved sister."&#xD;
The blood rushed to the face of the young wife, and slowly&#xD;
disengaging herself, she sprang up and said, " Now for tea;''&#xD;
and they sat down to the well-served table.&#xD;
"'Take Mr. Nordheim's seat, opposite me," said the lady.&#xD;
Marion complied.&#xD;
"1Have you no sister, Marion ?"&#xD;
"None-and no. brother either. I am an only child."&#xD;
"And that is my case precisely, and now we will be brother&#xD;
and sister to each other. I will love you and you shall love&#xD;
me, and Mr. Nordheim "-       She stopped.   "Well, Mr.&#xD;
Nordbeim don't trouble me with any of his doings, and I don't&#xD;
see why I should bother him with telling that I have adopted&#xD;
a brother ;-so, dear Marion, when Mr. Nordheim is at home,&#xD;
you must call me 'Madam,' and be as respectful to my lady.&#xD;

troubled with this formality,on his account. Now drink ano-&#xD;

know how I came to marry Mr. Nordheim, and all about it ?"&#xD;
Marion smiled, and looked anxiously at the beautiful crea-&#xD;
ture opposite to him. She took her hands, and flung back,&#xD;
from each side of hei face the masses of dark, beautiful curls&#xD;
that partly concealed her features, and completely covered her&#xD;
snow-white neck and shoulders.&#xD;

"What do you think of all I have told you ?" she pleas tti&#xD;
inquired.&#xD;
"Why, what wouldd I think, except that you have done*&#xD;

Bessy Nordheim drew a long sigh, and then made Marion&#xD;
tell her all his history, his plans and prospeAts. ,&#xD;
"I don't like your being in that boarding-house. Why,&#xD;
would be much more-- . We have plenty of room- in thia.&#xD;

"Here is your new clerk come to thank you and me foghik&#xD;

"Certainly," replied Marion. "Anything that 4Ian do for&#xD;

- Mrs. Nordheim had taken a seat, and listened,but said nothing.&#xD;
" Where are you boarding ?" he ayked.             g&#xD;
" At 119 iberty street."&#xD;

Mis    rose to take his leave-and as he approached Mrs.&#xD;
Nor      -'and took her hand, he felt a gentle detention and&#xD;
re-d a glance of those beautiful soft eyes, which said&#xD;

nig    He had made up his mind that the handsome, intelli-&#xD;

When he returned to the parlor, he said somewhat surlily,&#xD;
That boy "owes his place to me. I only hope he will be&#xD;
rateful. He is a stranger here, and I must go to his board-&#xD;
jnglouse and see if he is comfortable. It is,,ny duty to do so,&#xD;

It is very kind of you; but I suppose boarding-houses are&#xD;
not very, omfortable."&#xD;
"YoiPught to know ;"-and Mr. Nordheim sneere d very&#xD;

aunt, Mrs. Ferguson, was engaged in keeping a house of that&#xD;
kind, when I was so fortunate as to be 'struck with your silly&#xD;
Bessy's eyes were flashing fire under their long dark lashes.,&#xD;
Now, madam, I do not expect,_that my young friend will&#xD;

relatives to this house. He is not a relative,  but a young boy&#xD;
that will be useful to me, and I prefer to have him in the same&#xD;
house with me. Don't say. a word, madam-I will have it so."&#xD;
And Mr. Nordheim, who had worked himself into quite a pas-&#xD;

pressed forward, her figure erect, her eyes sparkling with ex,&#xD;
citement, as she flung back the long curling tresses which she&#xD;
had allowed to cover and conceal her delighted face while he&#xD;
was talking with her, he might have thought that his deter-&#xD;
mined purpose was not so obnoxious to his girlish wife as he&#xD;
imagined, She burst out into a merry, happy laugh asshe&#xD;
heard the street door close, and exclaimed, "Dear, dear Ma-&#xD;

have thought that Mr. Nordheim himself would insist -upon his&#xD;
being here, when I hardly dared to ask it !' She was as in-&#xD;

she thought she felt for the handsome boy.&#xD;

THE new clerk improved in his capacity for general use.&#xD;
fulness every week, but he had been nearly a month at hir&#xD;
new place, before Mr. Nordheima carried out the idea expressed&#xD;
to his wife. He then called on Mrs. Birch, in Liberty street,&#xD;
and apparently was not satisfied with the place selected for&#xD;
Marion. He informed the landlady that it would be more&#xD;
convenient to have Marion at his own residence. He paid her&#xD;
bill, and when he returned to the office of Granville &amp;amp; Nord-&#xD;
heim, he infornied Marion of what he had done, and told him&#xD;
to hire a cart, and remove his baggage to Bond street that&#xD;
night. It was Saturday,&#xD;
" Here is a note, Marion, that I wish you to deliver to Mrs.&#xD;
Nordheim, It informs her that I aiii obliged to go to Phila-&#xD;
delphia this evening, and may not return until the middle of&#xD;
next week.   I wish you to take. good care of 'matters at my&#xD;
house.  If any thing is needed, get the money from. Mrs.&#xD;
Nordheim and procure it.  If she wishes to go any where-&#xD;

In this note to her, 'I have written my wishes as I have ver-&#xD;
bally stated them to you; I hope you will be pleased with&#xD;

make any comment.    As soon as the store was closed that'&#xD;
evening, he engaged a hack and went to Liberty street, bade&#xD;
his landlady good bye, and with his trunk proceeded to Bond&#xD;
street.&#xD;
The hackman had carried his trunk into the hall before Mrs.&#xD;
Nordheim made her appearance.   She seemed a little sur-&#xD;
prised at the trunk, but when Marion had shaken hands with&#xD;
hed, and she had read her husband's note, her features as-&#xD;
sumed a different apperrance, and were covered with rosy&#xD;
blushes.&#xD;
"How beautiful you do look, Bessy," was the involuntary&#xD;
exclamation of Marion as he was led by her into the parlor.&#xD;
"-Now, Mr. Truant, give an account of yourself, why have&#xD;
you kept away from here ~i long month ?"&#xD;
Marion said he did not see how he could come with any&#xD;
propriety, as Mr. Nordheim had told him weeks ago, that he&#xD;
was to come-until the latter directed him to do so, as definite-&#xD;
ly as he had that day.&#xD;
"And now that you have come, I am going to make the most&#xD;
of you, brother dear.  Mr. Nordheim writes that you are to&#xD;
escort me wherever I want to go, and be my protector while&#xD;
he is gone.  Good.  I am very much obliged to my husband.'&#xD;
Next. I am to fix up your room in the most comfortable&#xD;
manner, and not to fail to treat you with the utmost blindness&#xD;
 "-you see, sir,-I quote from the note.  In the first place, I&#xD;
fancy that I have already made your room very cosy, as I had&#xD;
a hint this morning from my lord and master, that you -would&#xD;
probably come, and as for treating. you with kindness, why,&#xD;
you ungrateful brother, after such a long absence,- and such&#xD;
sisterly kindness, have you no reward to offer me ?" and, as&#xD;
Ahe put her pretty pouting red lips in close proximity to Ma-&#xD;
rion's, he could do no less than put his arms around her, draw&#xD;
her close to his breast, and press the lips to his own.&#xD;
"There, dear Marion, that will do, and now I will go and&#xD;
superintend the making-tea department, and you shall have a&#xD;
supper such as I dare say you need."&#xD;
Had Marion Monck and   essy Nordheim really been brother&#xD;
and sister, it is not probable that they would have exhibited a&#xD;
stronger attachment for each other. The next day was Sunday.&#xD;
Marion accompanied her to church, and almost every night he&#xD;
went with her to some place of amusement, or called withher&#xD;
upon some of her. extremely limited circle of. acquaintances-.&#xD;

the book-keeper had promoted him to copying letters, and to&#xD;
making duplicates of letters and invoices. As Marion wrote a&#xD;
neat mercantile hand, it was no great hardship.  Marioialso&#xD;
found work at the dwelling house of Mr. Nordheim. Thagen-&#xD;
tleman was, as I have stated, an Israelite, and had inherited a&#xD;
large property from his father, who had died about two years&#xD;
previously at Amsterdam in Holland. When he discovered&#xD;
that Marion could read and write Dutch, he was overjoyed, and&#xD;
Marion for months worked several hours at night in copying&#xD;
important papers in that language of a private nature for-Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim, The latter bought a nice desk, and had it placed&#xD;
in Marion's room.  Frequently Mrs'. Nordheim would sit and&#xD;
chat with him, while' hard athis work. She was as fascinating&#xD;
in her conversation as she was beautiful and attractive in her&#xD;
appearance, although she did not seem to be aware of it. -Ma-&#xD;
rion regarded her as a sister, and- treated her as he would a&#xD;
sister. He would eatch her and draw her upon his knees, and&#xD;
make perfectly free with her balmy mouth and lips. Some-&#xD;
times if her magnificent hair had been carefully arranged, he&#xD;
would pull out the combs and fastenings, throw it loose over&#xD;
her, and comb it with the finger of one hand, while he contin-&#xD;
ued writing with the other. Bessy would call him her teasing&#xD;
brother, and then select one ,f her combs, would carefully&#xD;
comb his hair, -without preventing his writing. Did a thought&#xD;
of wrong cross their minds '  No.  She had been isolated&#xD;
first in her aunt's boarding-house, and secondly, in the cold&#xD;
home of her husband. She placed Marion on the footing of. a&#xD;
brother. He had brought the first sunshine to her cheerless&#xD;
home. She had something to pet, fondle and caress.- She&#xD;
never thought it wrong, never analyzed her feeling, and hard-&#xD;
ly took the trouble to control or conceal them before Mr. Nord-&#xD;
heim. . Marion was in a new hoie-he who had been petted&#xD;
all his'life, and Bessy was the only one who brought love and&#xD;
home-or home love, back again to h~is mind. He appeared&#xD;
to regard her affectionate kindness and caresses' as he would&#xD;
those of his aunt or his mother. He was too young to dream&#xD;
or think of love. Both were happy, for both were innocent in&#xD;
thought or word as well as deed.&#xD;
Mr. 'Nordheim was a man whose age must have been nearly&#xD;
forty years. He was of small stature, with dark, piercing,&#xD;
oriental sort of eyes, and a nose that clearly told his Hebirew&#xD;
origin. He spoke English, with great purity, and one could&#xD;

hardly have imagined that Dutch had been the language of his&#xD;
boyhood. He was short-sighted, and wore a pair of gold spec-&#xD;
tacles. His habits were very irregular, although it was many&#xD;
months before Marion discovered that he wAs one of the worst&#xD;
of ljbartines, and that his frequent journeyings to other places&#xD;
for tu iness purposes, and also his frequent absence for the&#xD;
same reasons, were not so. On the contrary he was off in the&#xD;
country, or anywhere else where he could carry on his nume-&#xD;
rous .intrigues without discovery. As he was the principal&#xD;
capitalist, his partner, Granville, if he knew Nordheim's weak-&#xD;
ness, did not notice it in any manner.&#xD;
Marion Monck had not been in the counting-room of Gran-&#xD;
ville and Nordheim over two months, before Mr. Wilson, the&#xD;
bookkeeper, asked him how he was off for books ?&#xD;
"Books ?" replied Marion. "I have no book, save one, and&#xD;
that is a Dutch Bible which my mother placed in my trunk&#xD;
when I left home."  Mr. Wilson smiled.  lie probably re-&#xD;
membered his own mother having made for him, when a boy,&#xD;
(perhaps fifty years before this) a similar provision. "That is&#xD;
a valuable book, no question of that," said Mr. Wilson, "but,&#xD;
- Master Marion, what I meant is this, is there any one you&#xD;
kno~w who is the possessor of books who will lend them to you to&#xD;
read, otherwise you will have many an idle hour hang heavy&#xD;
upon your hands." Marion siid he knew no one who would&#xD;
lend him books such as lie desired. " Mr. Nor dheim has&#xD;
books at home."  "Then I propose that you should- at once&#xD;
join the Mercantile Libirary Association. It was established&#xD;
1'for merchants' clerks, and when once a member you will have&#xD;
access to any book or paper that you need."  Marion asked the&#xD;
expense of joining, and when told that it was only the small&#xD;
sum of two dollars per annum, agreed to go with Mr.- Wilson&#xD;
and be made a member that very night. The counting-room&#xD;
was closed before six o'clock, and Marion did not go home,&#xD;
but went to get his tea with Mr. Wilson, at Clark &amp;amp; -Brown's&#xD;
eating-house, in Maiden Lane, where Mr. Wilson, with many&#xD;
other Englishmen, boarded, and took his meals when and&#xD;
where he pleased. They each had a cup of tea and hot muf.-&#xD;
fins, and after these were despatched, they proceeded to Cliff&#xD;
street, where the Mercantile Library Association occupied the&#xD;
first floor of number eighty-two. It was then poor and in its&#xD;
infancy. Not long after, it was removed to a building in&#xD;

ation. - Mr. Wilson introduced Marion to the Treasurer, Li-&#xD;
biarian, and one or'two -of the Directors, and after he had paid&#xD;
the fees, received a certificate of membership. "Is there any&#xD;
particular book you desire ?" asked the Librarian.  "Yes,"&#xD;
replied Marion, and he named a French work by Voltaire. It&#xD;
was given him with a catalogue and the last report of tehe As-&#xD;
sociation. As Mr. Wilson and Marion went out into the street,&#xD;
Wilson remarked, "Why, Marion,. the book you selected is&#xD;
printed in the French language. Do you understand it ?"&#xD;
" Not a word," was the reply. "You may think it queer, Mr.&#xD;
Wilson, but I will read that book before I return it., The fact&#xD;
is, Mr. Wilson, I will read Frencl Spanish and German before&#xD;
I am two years older. I understand Netherland Dutch now as&#xD;
well as English. I will learn a language after my own.ethod,&#xD;
or rather one taught me by Aunt, who taught me low Dutch."&#xD;
" What is the method,?" enquired Wilson.&#xD;
" In the first place, I can repeat the New Testament almost&#xD;
word for word from beginning to, end. I have read it-so often,&#xD;
and got so many lessons from it in former years to oblige a&#xD;
very excellent mother. YoA comprehend that part."&#xD;
Very well.'&#xD;
"Within three days I have been to the Bible Society, and&#xD;
they gave me for a trifling sum a'New Testament in French. I&#xD;
shall read that in French until I-have it almost by heart. By&#xD;
the time I am through, or before I have been at it a few hours,&#xD;
I shall understand perhaps a thousand French words, and the&#xD;
mode of placing them without having to refer to a French&#xD;
Grammar or Dictionary."&#xD;
"That is very clear," remarked Wilson.&#xD;
"Now I shall get a dictionary and grammar, read the work&#xD;
by Voltaire, and what words I cannot acquire rapidly in the&#xD;
New Testament, I shall get out of the dictionary. It will not&#xD;
be long before I have mastered the French, and the Spanish&#xD;
and German will follow."&#xD;
" But how will you learn the pronunciation of the lan-&#xD;
guage ?"&#xD;
"By placing myself where I can hear one or the other spoken&#xD;
incessantly. But we are up to Broadway, and I mast bid you&#xD;
good-night, and hurry up to Bond street,"&#xD;

CHAPTER YIJI.&#xD;
'he Budness Excursion of Mr. Nordheim-Birth-place of Clara Norris..&#xD;
Her Advent into New York.&#xD;
IT has already been mentioned that Mr. Nordheim made fre-&#xD;
quent excursions to neighbQring cities. .He gave out that&#xD;
these frequent trips were for commercial purposes. His part-&#xD;
ner, Mr. Granville, did not contradict such announcements,&#xD;
and his family were unable to do so.&#xD;
October had arrived, and Marion Monck had been living at&#xD;
the residence of Mr. Nordheim more than four months, when&#xD;
the latter informed him that the next morning he should leave&#xD;
for a distant State, and would not probably return for some&#xD;
weeks. Mrs. Nordheim was in the parlor engaged upon some&#xD;
embroidery when her husband made this business sort of an-&#xD;
nouncement, and, as usual, she made no comment upon it.&#xD;
Turning to his wife, he said, " Of course, my love, if you want&#xD;
money, you can send word to the office by Marion in the usual&#xD;
manner, and he will bring it up to you." This was said in a&#xD;
very sarcastic manner, and a slight bend of the magnificent&#xD;
head of the young wife was the only reply. Soon after he left&#xD;
the house to go to Pat Hearns', or some other equally well&#xD;
known "Hell," or a worse place.&#xD;
The carrying out of our story requires that the reader&#xD;
should be carried out of New York, and taken to one of the&#xD;
most northern counties of the state of New Jersey.  It is&#xD;
again evening, and onlytwo days later than when Mr. Nord-&#xD;
heim told Marion that he was to make a business excursion the&#xD;
next morning. It was night, the tallow candles were lit, and&#xD;
in the bar-room of a country inn in Sussex county was the&#xD;
well-dressed Nordheim.  Several rough.looking countrymen&#xD;
were loitering about the bar-room, and two were engaged in&#xD;
playing dominoes at a pine table in the corner of the room. A&#xD;
young and rather pretty girl was behind the bar, waiting upon&#xD;
such customers as required a glass of cider, or the more potent&#xD;
cider brandy. Mr. Nordheim was smoking a cigar, and seated&#xD;
near the fire place, in which a wood fire was burning, for the-&#xD;
weather in October in a village. two thousand -feet above the&#xD;
&#xD;
level of the sea was intensely- cold. The girl was evidently&#xD;
about fifteen years of age, but fully developed.  Every now&#xD;
and then she cast an anxious glance towards Mr. Nordheim,&#xD;
and as his eyes caught her own, she would suddenly drop&#xD;
thlem and blush, scarcely conscious why. Mr. Nordheim was&#xD;
evidently an object of curiosity to her, and the contrast be-&#xD;
tween his elegance and the rough customers in the room made&#xD;
her wonder what his business could be there. Presently an-&#xD;
other person entered the room, and as he stepped, into the&#xD;
bar he said, sternly, "Susan, go into the kitchen and help&#xD;
your mother get supper.&#xD;
"Have -you ordered a fire in my room ?" demanded Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim of the new comer, who was evidently the landlord.&#xD;
"I have just finished making it myself, and your supper&#xD;
will be ready presently," was the reply.&#xD;
"Thank you," was the reply of Nordheim; and he continued&#xD;
to puff away at his cigar. Soon after Mr. Nordheim obtained&#xD;
supper and then retired to his room.  He found a good fire&#xD;
blazing ,upon the hearth, and almost at once the girl called&#xD;
Susan made her appearance with a candle, which she placed&#xD;
upon the table.&#xD;
"Any thing else, sir 1" she asked.&#xD;
"No, my dear-stay, yes-there is-I want to ask you a&#xD;
few questions.  Are you acquainted with a young lady in this&#xD;
neighborhood.whose name is Clara Norris ? Sit down, Su-&#xD;
san.&#xD;
Susan took a seat before she replied, in a very low tone of&#xD;
voice, ' Oh, yes, sir; I know her very well."&#xD;
"Indeed. Here, Susan, is a little something to spend when&#xD;
I am gone."  He placed in her hands half a dollar, patted her&#xD;
cheeks pleasantly-" and now tell me all about Clara. Is she&#xD;
very beautiful ? is she as pretty as you are&#xD;
Susan simpered and'replied, "Oh, yes;- a thousand times&#xD;
prettier. Etery body calls her the Sussex Lily, and indeed,&#xD;
sir, she is the sweetest girl in this region."&#xD;
"How old is Clara, should you think ?" asked Mr Nord-&#xD;
heim.&#xD;
"I know precisely. She is just one month younger than&#xD;
me, and I shall be' fifteen next month. Do you know her,&#xD;
sir ?" and Susan paused to hear the answer.&#xD;
"No, not exactly, that is to say, I have not yet seen her. I&#xD;
became acquainted with her father last summer, and I have&#xD;
heard him speak of Clara so frequently that I was almost&#xD;
tempted to say -I knov her, but I do not."&#xD;

"Oh, she is a charming girl. You will like her very much.&#xD;
She is not at all like me. Her hair is light auburn, and very&#xD;
long, and when she wears it in ringlets it is pretty. She has a&#xD;
beautifulofigure, and her .cheeks are as red as roses,- and her,&#xD;
skin is as white as snow."&#xD;
"XWhy, Susan, you are quite eloquent in your description,"&#xD;
said Mr. Nor dheim, and he continued, "Is Miss Clara coi-&#xD;
fortable in her home ?"&#xD;
" Oh, no indeed, sir. Her father is a drunkard, and her&#xD;
mother is not much better-in fact-worse, some. say, but I&#xD;
don't know any thing about it. I see poor Clara every Sunday&#xD;
at church, and she looks very unhappy, I don't know how she&#xD;
stands it. I wouldn't. If my father licked me as her'n does&#xD;
her, I'd run off and go to York, but I must go and help get&#xD;
supper for the other boarders."&#xD;
"1Stay one moment, Susan," dnd as the girl stopped he slid&#xD;
his arm around her and gave her a long kiss upon her mouth.&#xD;
" Oh, don't, sir-what-.will "--but a half dozen kisses in suc-&#xD;
cession stifled her voice, and when Mr. Nordheim placed in&#xD;
her hand another silver half dollar, Susan wiped her mouth,&#xD;
smoothed her ruffled hair, and promised Mr. Nordheim that&#xD;
she would come back as soon as supper was over to see if h&amp;amp;&#xD;
wanted any thing. Any of her country beaux might have fid-&#xD;
dled around Susan six months -before her lips would have given&#xD;
one kiss. Girls like the man, be he'old or young, that impu-&#xD;
dently takes what he wants without trifling or beating around&#xD;
the bush. She had left the* room but an instant when her&#xD;
father made his appearance. "Well, Van Ness, what is it ?"&#xD;
asked Nordheim.&#xD;
" Did you send a message by the stage-driver to old Bill&#xD;
Norris, up the road, that you wished to see him ?"&#xD;
"I did. Has he come&#xD;
"Yes, sir. He is down in the bar-room."&#xD;
"Van Ness, have you any really good liquor, any wine fit to&#xD;
drink ? That cider brandy is vile stuff."&#xD;
"Yes, sir, as good as any gentleman need have, I don't care&#xD;
who or what he is. . I have got the best French brandy, but it&#xD;
comes at two dollars the bottle."&#xD;
" Bring it along if it was five dollars, and here, by the way,&#xD;
is a five dollar gold piece, and if you have a bottle of cham-&#xD;
*pagne, bring that up also, and never mind the change.  Old&#xD;
Norr*s may prefer some other drink besides brandy or wine."&#xD;
" Not he, sir. He will never leave this room as long as&#xD;
there is another drop of that French brandy in the bottle."&#xD;

. "Show him up at once, and then put some more wood on the&#xD;
fire."&#xD;
A few moments more and the heavy boots of Bill Norris ap-&#xD;
proached the door.  "Come in," exclaimed Nordheim, and&#xD;
the old drunkard entered. "Take a seat, Norris.  I am glad&#xD;
to see you. I told-you at Dover last summer I would come&#xD;
and see you before Christmas day."&#xD;
"So you have. I like to see a man who sticks to his word.&#xD;
It looks like business."&#xD;
"True, Mr. Norris; but here is some liquor I have ordered.&#xD;
It is no use talking with, dry' tongues. Here is champagne,&#xD;
and here is French brandy. Which will you try ?"&#xD;
"Oh, give me the brandy. I don't Want any new fangled&#xD;
stuff down my throat," and he helped himself to a stiff glass of&#xD;
raw brandy, and drank it off at a gulp. It did not even make&#xD;
the old toper wink. "Prime !" he exclaimed. "Now I will&#xD;
take another with a little water into it," and he helped him-&#xD;
self while Mr. Nordheim knocked off the neck of the bottle of&#xD;
17 1    champagne, and as he poured it foaming into the glass tumbler&#xD;
he said, " Now, Norris, I want you to drink with me to the&#xD;
health of that young girl we talked so much about at Dover.&#xD;
Here is Clara's health."  Old Bill Norris again emptied his&#xD;
glass and took a seat, and turning his face full upon Mr. Nord-&#xD;
heim, said, "So, so, mister, yer haint got off that notion, eh ?"&#xD;
- "No indeed; the more I hear of her the more anxious ami&#xD;
come to some understanding with you in regard to her fu-&#xD;
ture welfare. Where is she now ?"&#xD;
"At hum, or was there half an hour ago."&#xD;
"Bill, can any one overhear our. conversation?20"&#xD;
"No,'I reckon not." Bill opened the door and looked into&#xD;
the entry to ace that the coast Was clear.&#xD;
"When you see my darter, if as how you likes her, and she&#xD;
takes a kind of liking to you,.what do you intend jo do with&#xD;
her? Do ye mean to marry her ' That's the pint."&#xD;
"Mr. Norris, we will talk of that presently, meanwhile, I&#xD;
want to enquirer kindly of you whether five hundred dollars, if&#xD;
given to you by some kind friend, would really be of any ser-&#xD;
vice to you ?" remarked Mr. Nordheim in a whisper.&#xD;
"'What?   Just say that over again," and Bill was on his&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
"Keep perfectly calm, Mr. Norris. I have five hundred&#xD;
dollars that I can get by driving-up to the Sussex Bank after&#xD;
nine o'clock to-morrow morning, and I could give, it to yof&#xD;
without feeling the loss."&#xD;

Five hundred dollars. Sussex Bank bills! and"-&#xD;
"Stop one moment more.   I am anxious to do that for you&#xD;
to-moirow. I am anxious to do more than that for Clara, if&#xD;
you aid me in the matter. I want to take her away from here,&#xD;
however, and you will lose her services. Of course I expect&#xD;
to pay you for that loss."&#xD;
"That's fair.' Five hundred dollars. Of course I'll let her&#xD;
go for that. She will never bring me any thing like that.&#xD;
Five hundred' dollars! Whew! What a sum. Why, it will&#xD;
buy a good sized house and farm, won't 'it ?  But you hadn't&#xD;
told me one thing. What do you want to do with the girl?'&#xD;
Marry her ?"&#xD;
"1Mr. Norris, you know it would be imprudent to do so now.&#xD;
What I may do when I have sent her to school, I cannot tell.&#xD;
I shall take her to New York, place her with a rich aunt, and&#xD;
she will be taken good care of. What can I do more ?"&#xD;
"That is all on the square. I don't see what you can do&#xD;
fairer, Mister. What am I to do ?"&#xD;
"Go home very soon. Talk the matter over quietly to&#xD;
your wife. Get her consent. In the morning I will be up at&#xD;
your house, and have a talk with Clara, if she consents to go,&#xD;
with me and the matter is fairly understood among you. She&#xD;
goes to Dover in the stage with me to-morrow evening, and I&#xD;
will hand you and your wife five hundred dollars before we&#xD;
leave."&#xD;
"It's a bargain. Shake hauids upon it.  You are a gentle-&#xD;
man, and do up your business brown. I will go now."&#xD;
"Take some more brandy."&#xD;
"Not a drop," and Mr. Norris left-he was really sober;&#xD;
the five hundred dollar proposition had fairly neutralized the&#xD;
effects of the, strong potions of alcohol which he rad drank.&#xD;
He had hardly got down stairs before a light step came up&#xD;
'them, and Susan came in, shutting the door behind her. "I&#xD;
.came up to see if you needed any thing," she observed.&#xD;
"Yes, Susy, come here," and he pulled her towards him.&#xD;
"Don't--don't--I"- NTA&#xD;
"All I want, Suisy, is to hear more about your friend Clara,&#xD;
Kiss me, now, and then tell me, has she any beaux'?"&#xD;
"You kiss me so hard I don't like it. No ; Clara hasn't got,&#xD;
any fellows.  She is too proud for that.  None up here are&#xD;
good enough for her."&#xD;
"Indeed. I am glad to hear that,"-here Susan began to&#xD;
.squirm in a very uneasy manner, for Mr. Nordheim was re-&#xD;
sorting to all sorts of means to stir up the young girl's passions,&#xD;

" If you are so anxious about Clara, what do you want to fool&#xD;
with me for 2"  It was nough.  "I was wrong. -Now kiss&#xD;
me, to show that you are not angry." -Susan complied, and he&#xD;
led her to the door.* She had escaped that time, but' the poor&#xD;
chirping bird was marked for a shot, and only got away be-&#xD;
cause a beautiful quail was to be looked after.&#xD;
When Mr. Nordheim was alone, 'he lit another cigar and&#xD;
then went down to the bar-room. Bill Norris had gone. The&#xD;
room was crowded. Mr. Nordh'eim had an object-it was to&#xD;
make popularity. Time after time did he treat every man in&#xD;
the room until' all but himself were drunk-roaring country&#xD;
drunk, and then he went to bed. How little his elegant wife&#xD;
dreamed of the nature of her husband's commercial negotia-&#xD;

The next day opened bright and beautiful. It was much&#xD;
warmer, and 1Mr. Nordheim rose early. He had ordered a&#xD;
horse and buggy to be ready for' his use immediately after&#xD;
breakfast. It came as he had drank his last cup of coffee. He&#xD;
settled his bill, paid for a day's use of the horse and buggy,&#xD;
observing that he might- not return. The carpet bag was&#xD;
placed in the buggy, and after a few enquiries as to his route&#xD;
to the house of Mr. Norris, he bade his host " good morning."&#xD;
and started on the main road.  He had to drive a distance of&#xD;
two miles.. He occasionally stopped to gaze on the woods and&#xD;
the water.  The forests were covered with colors as varie-&#xD;
gated as the rainbow, and he passed two long sheets of water&#xD;
that he could not but stop to admire.  Between the two first&#xD;
lakes stood a cottage embowered in a grove of large drooping&#xD;
willows, and not far off was a long row of poplars. He en-&#xD;
quired what place that was. "Poplar Farm," was the reply,&#xD;
and he drove on. He had nearly reached the head of the'sec-&#xD;
ond lake, and was coming in sight of the third, when he no-&#xD;
ticed a log-cabin that seemed hardly capable of holding up it-&#xD;
self. It was large, but every thing ab6ut the spot looked&#xD;
poverty-struck and desolate. He was passing on, by it when&#xD;
out started a man that he recognized as Bill Norris.&#xD;
"Hallo. What, you was a-going by, eh ? That won't do."&#xD;
"Have you a place to put my horse, Norris ?"&#xD;
"Yes; I got a little snuggery down under- the hill. Drive-&#xD;
around the road a little way, and I will come and help you'un-&#xD;
'hitch,"&#xD;
Mr. Nordheini complied, and when the horse was put in&#xD;

the miserable apology. for a stall, Nordheim asked if the moth.&#xD;
er had been spoken with.&#xD;
"Yes ; and she is willin'. She thinks it the best thing that&#xD;
can be done."&#xD;
"And Clara-does she know any thing of what is pro-&#xD;
posed ?" said Nordheim, anxiously.&#xD;
"I rather think the old woman had something to say to her&#xD;
about it, but I don't know. Women folks can't keep a secret,&#xD;
you understand."&#xD;
Nordheim felt relieved. Ialf his work was done. The two&#xD;
now reached the log-cabin. Norris entered first, but no sooner&#xD;
had Nordheim followed over the door-sill than he actually&#xD;
started back wit astonisbment.  Never had his eyes been&#xD;
placed upon sue a vision of female loveliness. He could not&#xD;
speak. She was dressed in rags, but there was a form, a tom-&#xD;
plexion,, a skin that rags could not hide. She had been trying&#xD;
to do up her splendid hair, but lacking combs and material, it&#xD;
had fallen like a golden cloud over her shoulders and reached&#xD;
nearly to her knees. Nordheim jumped towards her, took her&#xD;
hand, and observed, " This is Clara. I need no more of an&#xD;
introduction--.don't be scared on my account," and then, with&#xD;
the grace of a man of the world, he placed all at their ease by&#xD;
talking of their future. There was a little boy and a little&#xD;
girl, brother and sister of Clara,  To one he gave a pearl-&#xD;
handled knife, and to the other a gold pencil..case.  "Now&#xD;
then, Mrs. Norris, I am going to dine with you, 'and here is&#xD;
some money t6 buy any' article you need. I suppose Mr. Nor-&#xD;
ris will go and get it for you." She took the 'money. "Miss&#xD;
Clara, as I was riding up, I could not help admiring the mountain&#xD;
in front of us. There nust be a beautiful view of the lake&#xD;
fiom the top of it. Suppose you accompany me, and point out&#xD;
all that is to be seen," requested Mr. Nordheim, kindly.&#xD;
"Get your bonnet and go with the gentleman," came from&#xD;
the mother's mouth.&#xD;
"I am in no hurry," observed Nordheim, "'Take your own&#xD;
time, Clara." This he said so kindly that the poor girl burst&#xD;
into tears. A few moments after he was following her up the&#xD;
side of the mountain. "Clara," called Mr. Nordheim.  She&#xD;
stopped, and he took her hand in his own. "Don't let us go&#xD;
too far and get tired.  Here seems to be a nice quiet place,&#xD;
where we can take a seat and talk over certain matters."&#xD;
Clara seated herself by his side. He still kept her hand.&#xD;
" Clara, will you answer me a few questions honestly and&#xD;
truly ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"T     --will.&#xD;
"Are you happy here ? Do your parents treat you kindly ."&#xD;
"No---I am miserable, and they treat me horribly."&#xD;
"Would you like to leave here ?" he asked, kindly&#xD;
"With all my heart! But my poor parents !"&#xD;
"Clara, suppese I say that I will give your par n s the sum&#xD;
of $500 to-night, to make them comfortable. Will you then&#xD;
place yourself under my charge&#xD;
"Will I? Try me. But what am I to do?"&#xD;
"This is all, Clara, if you will make me your husband. to-&#xD;
night-that is, you will treat me in .every way as if I were&#xD;
your husband."&#xD;
" But will you marry me to-night ?" said the girl, who was&#xD;
covered with blushes. "Speak plain," she continued.  I&#xD;
know what you mean., You will nwt marry me, but you wish&#xD;
me to become your mistress; you have money, and you would&#xD;
buy me! Now repeat the offer,".said Clara, determinedly,,&#xD;
" Yes, Clara, ,that is it. I will take you from here to New&#xD;
York as speedily as possible. To-morrow morning we will&#xD;
start. . Then I will get you handsome clothes-I will procure&#xD;
you a home-I will get you teachers, and Iwill.-make a lady&#xD;
of you."&#xD;
Clara smiled, and said, "Listen to me, Mr. Nordheim.&#xD;
There is no need of words. I am a decided girl. I am as&#xD;
pure as ice-but I can't lead such a life. I want to see my&#xD;
father comfortable. Do what you said, and the next night I&#xD;
will return to my wretched room, remain in your arms. until&#xD;
morning, provided you then hurry me off to New York. If&#xD;
you do what you promise then, you will have a mistress that,&#xD;
will be true to you till death. If you deceive me, or do not,&#xD;
make good your promises, woe be on your head I-,Now let us&#xD;
return to our humble home."&#xD;
"Stay a moment, Clara. If you are anxious to go, why not&#xD;
start to-day ?"&#xD;
I' No--I will not move until I see my mother and father in&#xD;
possession of the price you have agreed to pay for me."&#xD;
"And then&#xD;
"I am yours, body and soul, and I do not care what you do&#xD;
with me."&#xD;
"I have the money ready. .See, here it is, in Sussex Bank&#xD;
bills. Count it."&#xD;
lie handed her the money. Clara did count it, and then&#xD;
slowly drawing her hand across her face, she asked,&#xD;
." And when~you give that, to my parents "-&#xD;

Then, Clara, I expect you to regard yourselfas mine. We&#xD;
will stay here to-night, or we will go to Dover, just as you&#xD;
decide. Now shall we return home ?"&#xD;
"Be it as you wish--I have no choice,"' said Clara, mourn-&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
Nordheim attempted to kiss her lips.&#xD;
"No, no," she exclaimed, while pushing him aside. "Not&#xD;
now. Pay the sum to my parents, and then I am yours alto-&#xD;
gether."&#xD;
Not a word was spoken until they reached the log house-.&#xD;
Clara took a seat.&#xD;
"Well ?".said the father..&#xD;
"Everything is pleasantly arranged, and Clara and myself&#xD;
have decided to leave for New York city either to-night or to-&#xD;
morrow morning. But I have something for you."&#xD;
He took out of his pocket-book a roll of bills, and laid it&#xD;
upon the table. Clara jumped up and seized the money. She&#xD;
selected from the roll five fifty dollar bills, and placed them in&#xD;
one pile. " Father,- take the money ;" and then an equal&#xD;
amount she handed to her other parent, adding, " Mother, take&#xD;
this. God bless you both !"1&#xD;
They each took the money. Then she kissed her mother, and&#xD;
afterwards her father, crying as if her heart were broken.&#xD;
When she had found voice, she said, "Now you have money,&#xD;
spend it wisely. Father, don't drink any more ; and when you&#xD;
think of doing it, think of poor me, and perhaps at what an&#xD;
awful cost I earned the money." Then turning to Mr. Nord-&#xD;
heim, sh~ added, almost hysterically, " Come sir, you have not&#xD;
yet deciJed whether you will stay here to-night or go to Dover.&#xD;
Followme, and I will show you my delightful bed-room. Up&#xD;
this ladder." *&#xD;
She was followed up by the exquisite New Yorker in .aston.-&#xD;
ishment. -As he reached the floor of the open garret, he ex-&#xD;
claimed, " Why, Clara, where do you sleep ?"&#xD;
- " There; she exclaimed, pointing to a pile of rags in a bor-&#xD;
ner of the garret; and she ran towards it, and loosing her hair&#xD;
so as almost to cover her entire figure, she flung herself upon&#xD;
the rags, and said, "Well, what do ypu think now ? This must&#xD;
be our bridal bed if youstay here to-night. My parents have&#xD;
no other."&#xD;
He went to her, calmed her excitement, and kindly coaxed&#xD;
her to descend the stairs. "We will start for Dover in a few&#xD;
minutes. .Fix up Clara the best you can," said he kindly to -&#xD;
her mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
Clara did not cry any more. She -spoke kindly to her mo-&#xD;
ther, and helped her to spread the table with -a few eatables.&#xD;
An hour later she took her seat in.the buggy beside Mr. Nord-&#xD;
heim. That same evening they reached Dover,. after a few&#xD;
hours' drive. They were just in time to catch the mail stage&#xD;
for New York via Newark. The next night at about ten&#xD;
o'clock the two reached a private house in the upper part of&#xD;
the city, where Mr. Nordheim seemed to be perfectly at home.&#xD;
Such was one of the business transactions of Mr. Nordheim.&#xD;
It was the opening history of a beautiful girl, who in after&#xD;
years made a sensation as the haughtiest as well as most mag-&#xD;
nificent courtezan that ever walked the s-treets of New York.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
The first year over--Dinner at Mr. Granville's-The Family of Air,&#xD;
Granville-Col. Mac Neil.&#xD;
LIFE in a counting-room during the period of junior clerk&#xD;
ship is without much of interest. The routine is about the&#xD;
same from day to day. A year had now elapsed since 'Marion&#xD;
arrived in-New York, and he had become quite expert in his&#xD;
clerical duties. He was a favorite with Mr. Granville, he con*&#xD;
tinued to reside at the residence of Mr. Nordheim, in Bond&#xD;
street, and oftentimes was of great service to that partner.&#xD;
Young Monek was a hard student,' and rarely retired to bed&#xD;
before twelve o'clock at night. He could read French well,&#xD;
and availed himself of every opportunity-of speaking it. This&#xD;
was the more easy, as the business of Granville and Nordheim&#xD;
was principally a foreign commission business. They received&#xD;
consignments of vessels and cargoes from many ports in the&#xD;
Mediterranean, and wine and assorted cargoes from Cette and&#xD;
Marseilles were regular. By such meanS Marion became ac-&#xD;
quainted with French captains and' French passengers that&#xD;
brought letters of introduction to the firm, and he used to show&#xD;
them the hospitalities of the city. His progress in pronounc-&#xD;
ing French *was extremely rapid from these facilities, so that&#xD;
at the expiration of his first year in New York he was a fair&#xD;
French scholar. The foundation was laid, and by practice he&#xD;
improved until he could write, read or speak French equal to&#xD;
a Frenchman. Mrs. Nordheim was his fellow student in French,&#xD;
and her progress was equally rapid with Marion ; for Mr. Nore&#xD;

&#xD;
heim spoke French well, and when she expressed a wish to&#xD;
that effect, he would converse with her in that language., Fre-&#xD;
quently Marion would take part in their conversation '&#xD;
It was a very curious fact, that for some months Mr. Nord-&#xD;
heim had not found occasion to be absent from the city, and&#xD;
he was much more kind and sociable at his home than before&#xD;
Marion came there. He was absent almost every night, but no&#xD;
curiosity was ever expressed by his wife or Marion as to the,&#xD;
cause of such absence.&#xD;
Marion ha4 had very few opportunities of knowing much of&#xD;
MrGranville or his family.- The intercourse between them'&#xD;
was only at the counting-house ; and although Mr. Granville&#xD;
appeared to be pleased with the attention which Marion showed&#xD;
to his business, yet he rarely noticed him save, to give orders&#xD;
or instructions. Marion had observed to Mr. Nordheim that&#xD;
Mr. Granville did not seem to be aware that he was in. exist-&#xD;
ence, save in the office.&#xD;
" Never mind, Marion," was the reply. "An old merchant&#xD;
like Mr. Granville does not waste much time on the youngest&#xD;
clerk in his employ. . Wait."I&#xD;
He took his advice. Precisely one year from the day he&#xD;
entered the office, Mr. Granville in the morning calledhim&#xD;
into his private office, and somewhat abruptly remarked,&#xD;
"It is a year that you have been with me."&#xD;
Marion was astonished. He could not conceive that the&#xD;
haughty merchant by any means should stop to remember such&#xD;
"a fact. He did not know the man-and he replied Yes sir.&#xD;
"Then to-morrow your salary will begin at three hundred&#xD;
dollars."*&#xD;
Marion-bowed and added, "I have not drawn my salary of&#xD;
two hundred and fifty dollars. There is nearly one hundred&#xD;
and fifty dollars due me now."1&#xD;
"How is that ?"&#xD;
"I have been living with Mr. Nordheim, and he has not&#xD;
said anything to m about what he should charge, and I did&#xD;
not think it would be right to draw under such circumstances."&#xD;
"Go and call in Mr. Wilson."           I&#xD;
It was done.&#xD;
"Wilson, 'ill up a check and bring it to me to sign for the&#xD;
balance due on this young man's salary up to date. In the&#xD;
coming year it will be three hundred dollars. Now, Mr. Monek,&#xD;
I-have nothing to do with my partner taking you to his house.&#xD;
I understand that you speak and write low D)utch~ and heus.&#xD;
made you useful to him to a greater amount than any board hes&#xD;
&#xD;
would charge' Make your mind easy on that score. He will&#xD;
make no charge against you-or if he does, give the account to&#xD;
me, and I will pay it out of my own pocket."'&#xD;
By this time Mr. Wilson had brought the check. It was for&#xD;
one hundred and sixty-five dollars, and Mr. Granville signed&#xD;
it. As he handed it to Marion, he laughingly said, " You will&#xD;
be quite rich. What will you do with so much money, eh 1"&#xD;
"9Send it to my parents, sir," replied Marion.&#xD;
" Very right and proper; and now, sir, will you do me the&#xD;
favor to conte and dine with me to-day at five o'clock?  I wish&#xD;
to make you acquainted with my family; and you will meet at&#xD;
my table one or more of my friends worth knowing. You know&#xD;
where my residence is, I suppose ; and be before the hour ra-&#xD;
ther than later, whenever you are invited out to dine.l"l&#xD;
"I shall be pleased to dine with you sir, and will not be&#xD;
later than the hour."&#xD;
Before we present Marion at this dinner with his senior em-&#xD;
ployer, it will be interesting to the reader to learn something&#xD;
of Mr. Granville. Williant Pitt Granville was the grandson&#xD;
of a man who was once speaker of the English House of Com-&#xD;
mons. He had been educated commercially in one of those&#xD;
extensive commercial firms in England, whose business con-&#xD;
nection extended over the world. The firm had sent Mr. Gran.&#xD;
vile to New York toattend to some special business,-andhis&#xD;
keen eye saw an opening in Nfe- York,'and he 'wrote ihome, to&#xD;
that effect. The London firm of Prescott, Grote &amp;amp; Co. had a&#xD;
correspondent named Nordheim, who had a son that he was&#xD;
anxious to place in business in some American port. The&#xD;
London firm saw that they could benefit these parties, besides&#xD;
their own firm, and the result was that old Nordheim aged&#xD;
to put $50,000 in cash in the firm for his son, and young Nord-&#xD;
heim in less than six months became the partner of Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville. Mr. Granville was the business man. His energy&#xD;
was unceasing. Connexions and agencies were made in every&#xD;
part of Europe; and what with Mr. Nordheim's cash capital,&#xD;
and the facilities -extended by the London firm and the elder&#xD;
Nordheim, business rolled in upon the NeW York firm from&#xD;
every quarter, and their profits in a short time were more than&#xD;
double their original capital.&#xD;
Mr: Nordheim, as we have before observed, was not much&#xD;
of a business man, and Mr. Granville persuaded him to go to&#xD;
Charleston, S. C.,nto procure shipments of rice and cotton to&#xD;
New York and to' his father's house in. Amsterdam. As he&#xD;
had money to advance on all such shipments, he was very sucd&#xD;

cessful in procuring them, and his sojourn in: Charleston was&#xD;
of great benefitsto all parties. It was while residing at Charles-&#xD;
ton that he became fascinated with Elizabeth Ferguson, and&#xD;
married her, as has been detailed in a former chapter.&#xD;
To return to Mr. Granville, He was English in. his appear-&#xD;
ance, habits, mode of thinking, and in every other way. lie&#xD;
believed that this* was a great country to make money in, but&#xD;
that England was the only country worth belonging to; and he&#xD;
never would take out papers to become an American citizen&#xD;
9 British I was born, and a Briton I will dip," was, a favorite&#xD;
expression. He was 9ix feet in height, and well-proportioned.&#xD;
His forehead was very high, and his head almost bald. le&#xD;
was fifty years -of age when Marion joined him. His nose was&#xD;
curved like the beak of an eagle, and he felt much flattered&#xD;
when told that this feature very much resembled that of the&#xD;
great Duke of Wellington. It was true, too. He had mar-&#xD;
ried in England, and brought-over with him, when he decided&#xD;
to remove to America, a wife and two children, the one a girl&#xD;
named Isabella, and the other a boy named Walter. His resi-&#xD;
dence was in a house which is still. standing in State street,&#xD;
fronting the Battery. At that time it was the residence of&#xD;
some of the most prominent merchants that New York has pro-&#xD;
duced. It was a venerable double house, painted yellow, with-&#xD;
a door in the centre, and an old-fashioned stop supported by&#xD;
two wooden pillars, with red stone steps on each side, leading&#xD;
up to the doorway. It had a large, spacious hall, four times&#xD;
the size of a hall in a modern house. On the right was a large&#xD;
reception room, or parlor, and on the left was another of equal&#xD;
dimensions, In the rear of the hall was a -dining-room, with&#xD;
large bay windows, extending nearly the width of the house,&#xD;
and overlooking a large yard, which was-filled with plants and&#xD;
shrubbery of every description. The view from the front par.-&#xD;
lors, or from any room in the front part of the house, was mag-&#xD;
nificent beyond comparison.  The windows overlooked the&#xD;
Battery and the bay, and the view in the summer season was&#xD;
unsurpassed in the world. There was nothing to equal it in&#xD;
New York. Mr. Granville had good taste.&#xD;
Besides his, wife and children, Mr. Granville had a younger&#xD;
brother residing in the old English mansion. This brother&#xD;
Thomas was as eccentric a being as ever drew breath; and we&#xD;
shall have much more to say of him as our story progresses.&#xD;
Mrs. Granville and Thomas were the only persons in the din-&#xD;
ing-room when Marion arrived. It was to them that Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville introduced Mr. Mock.&#xD;

&#xD;
Mrs. Granville appeared to be about forty years of age. She&#xD;
was very small in size, and extremely pale. She looked as&#xD;
though a good strong gust of wind from  the Battery would&#xD;
blow her away. She put out 'her hand-to Marion, and kindly&#xD;
greeted him, saying,&#xD;
"I have heard of you often from my husband, and expected&#xD;
you would have visited us before this; I am glad to* see you&#xD;
now, and I trust you will come and see us as often as you have&#xD;
,      leisure."&#xD;
Poor Mrs. Granville,. her days were numbered! Marion&#xD;
soon learned that her seclusion arose from the fact that she&#xD;
was dying of consumption.&#xD;
" I shall be most happy to continue the acquaintance, be-&#xD;
lieve me, Mrs. Granville; for I know very few families in the&#xD;
city."&#xD;
"Here comes Isa.-my daughter, this is Marion Monek."&#xD;
And a beautiful girl sprang forward and gave her hand to&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
"0, I have seen Marion a hundred times when I have skip-&#xD;
ped in and out of the office, but I am so glad Pa-has brought,&#xD;
him here. I abn sure we shall be excellent friends."&#xD;
A moment after Walter, the son cane in. He was a hand-&#xD;
some lad, of about Marion's age, but extremely reserved. He&#xD;
had already become acquainted with Marion, having seen him&#xD;
many times at the office. A gentleman came in just before the&#xD;
family rose to go to thedining-room. Mr. Granville introduced&#xD;
him to Marion as " Col. Mac Neil, a very old and valued friend."&#xD;
The Colonel in a very gentlemanly manner expressed great&#xD;
gratification at meeting Marion. Soon after the party that had&#xD;
assembled in the parlor adjourned to the large dining-room,&#xD;
Covers were placed for seven, and when all had taken their&#xD;
seats a dinner was served in a very simple manner, nd Ma-&#xD;
rion felt completely at his ease. His seat was directly oppo-&#xD;
site to Isabella Granville, and before he had received a dozen&#xD;
of her laughing glances, poor Marion began to feel that he was&#xD;
getting in love.&#xD;
"Bell," as her Pa called her, was a sweet little creature,&#xD;
very girlish in form and figure. Her eyes were black, and she&#xD;
had a profusion of soft black hair, which was partly taken up&#xD;
on the back of her head, and the front portion was arranged in&#xD;
curls.- Her mouth was small and pretty. She was ready to&#xD;
fall in love with anybody that there was a spark of romance&#xD;
about. Although only fourteen, she 'had had two lovers siues&#xD;
she was twelve. One was a West Point cadet, and the ofher&#xD;

&#xD;
an unfledged midshipman ; but her father, kind and gentle as&#xD;
he appeared, was,a stern, despotic man in his own house, and&#xD;
most fully imbued with the English ideas of marriage. He&#xD;
considered children as -merely a means of extending "connec.&#xD;
tions," and deemed it his duty to select a suitable husband for&#xD;
his daughter, and a proper match for his son, where settle-&#xD;
ments could be made on both sides. He detested cadets and&#xD;
midshipmen, lawyers,. doctors and clergymen. He had his&#xD;
own views for "Bell." Mr. Granville was a merchant, in the&#xD;
true meaning of the word, and he looked upon every man out-&#xD;
side of the commercial profession as not belonging to his world,&#xD;
and as a nobody. . He, believed in the English' nobility, noble&#xD;
blood, and all that sort of thing. He also thought that there&#xD;
might be a nobility in the United States ; but if there was any,&#xD;
that no class could justjl lay claim to it except the commer-&#xD;
cial class. A grea4 merchant was -an object of profound re-&#xD;
spect: the President of the United States he regarded as the&#xD;
principal Custom House officer in the nation, and he had a&#xD;
contempt for all Government officers, high or low. He deem..&#xD;
ed them a pack of useless suckers. There was one, class of&#xD;
the world that he respected next to merchants-they were ac.-&#xD;
tresses and actors. A celebrated English actress was a Mrs.&#xD;
Granville, a century ago. Ile was descended from her. This&#xD;
was the clue to the secret, that there was no actor or actress,&#xD;
from Kean the elder to Vandenhoff, and Ellen Tree to Mrs.&#xD;
Wilson and Miss Sheriff,! that he.did not invite to his huse.&#xD;
James and Henry Wallack were his intimate friends. Hackett&#xD;
found a banker in him when he needed one. In a word, no&#xD;
actor or actress came to this country from England without a&#xD;
letter of introduction to Mr. Granville. That was his weak-&#xD;
ness,-if he had any.&#xD;
When the ladies retired from the dinner'table Walter Gran-&#xD;
ville went with them, and the conversation continued until a&#xD;
late hour. Marion was delighted. Mr. Granville treated him&#xD;
as if he had been the richest merchant in the city, conversed&#xD;
with him, drew him out, made him athis ease, and yet not one&#xD;
word was said about the store, his own. position, or business.&#xD;
The shop was sunk, in the house of, Mr. Granville. It was&#xD;
nearly ten o'clock when Marion took his leave, and when he&#xD;
reached Bond street Mrs. Nordheim made him tell her all the&#xD;
events of the dinner, and particularly all that Colonel Mac Neil&#xD;
had said. ~But Colonel Mac Neil is is too important a person&#xD;
to bring in at the close of a chapter.              --&#xD;

~ CHAPTER X.&#xD;
Colonel William Mac Neil- Duel of Mr,. Graham and Colonel Barton.&#xD;
"Bnssy, pray tell me something about Colonel Mac Neil,&#xD;
whom I met at the dinner at Mr. Granville's. yesterday," ex-&#xD;
claimed Marion, at their early breakfast next morning toi Mrs.&#xD;
Nordheim. "I am sure you know something of his previous&#xD;
history."&#xD;
"Not so much, perhaps, as you may imagine. What I do&#xD;
know, I obtained from Mr.. Nordheim. - The fact is, the Colo-&#xD;
nel is a very gallant man, and Tegards himself as quite a lady-&#xD;
killer. He made love to me before I had been in New York&#xD;
three weeks. I rather astonished him by repeating some of&#xD;
his love speeches before him at dinner, when Mr. Nordheim&#xD;
was present.  The gallant Colonel did not make -any more&#xD;
sweet speeches to me, I can assure you. Mr., Nordheim was&#xD;
excessively pleased with my tact, as he called it, and in grati..&#xD;
tude, I suppose, for its display, told me somewhat of my gal-&#xD;
lant gentleman's antecedents. The Colonel is Scotch, and of&#xD;
a very good family. He must have been 'born somewhere&#xD;
about the year 1800, and I have heard him say he was only&#xD;
fourteen years old when his father, who commanded a regi-&#xD;
ment of Highlanders at Waterloo, was slain. . The young Mao&#xD;
afterwards emigrated to Canada with his mother, who married&#xD;
a second husband, and ten years ago came to this city.  lie&#xD;
was about twenty-one years of age, and had about ten thoa.-&#xD;
sand pounds Sterling in money. By Mr. Granville's advice&#xD;
he formed a partnership here and Went into the wine business&#xD;
with a Mr. Gillespie, who had no capital but great experience.&#xD;
Colonel Mae Neil is a dashing, fashionable man about town.&#xD;
le goes into the best society, boards at the City Hotel, is a&#xD;
manager at the City Assembly balls, and, though he has niade&#xD;
some seductions, and. one of his victims he keeps as a mistress&#xD;
in very good style, and has had two children by her, yet he is&#xD;
well received wherever be goes, and he is engaged to be mar-&#xD;
ried to the wealthy and accomplished Miss Grasper.&#xD;
"If he spends money in so princely a manner, I should think&#xD;
he would need to marry an heiress unless his business is a&#xD;
source of great profit," remarked Marion.&#xD;

"Mr. Nordheim says unless the Colonel marries money,&#xD;
that his high flown game will soon he up, that he gambles tre-&#xD;
mendously at Washington Hall every night. He is a good&#xD;
hand at cards, I dare say, and it may be that his luck and skill&#xD;
as a gambler is the secret of his having so much money to&#xD;
carry on the war with. You know what a noise he made some&#xD;
years ago as the second in a duel."&#xD;
"No; I do not. . Never heard of it."&#xD;
"It was a sad'affair. By the way, Marion, I do not wish to&#xD;
prejudice you against Colonel Mac Neil. He is -a great friend&#xD;
of both Mr. Granville and Qf my ,husband. -He is .a perfect&#xD;
man of the world, and when you are a few years older, it will&#xD;
be in his power-to be of great service to you.  I recommend&#xD;
you to cultivate an intimacy with him, and receive any advan-&#xD;
ces of a friendly nature on his part with cordiality."&#xD;
"Thank you.   I will not forget your advice. But about the&#xD;
duel ?".asked Marion.&#xD;
"I had -nearly forgot it. A Mr. Graham, connected with&#xD;
the Daily Courier, had some difficulty with Mr. Barton, who&#xD;
is more famous as the husband of Cora Livingston, a daughter&#xD;
of the great Edward Livingston, than any other-act of his life.&#xD;
It led to a demand for satisfaction on the part of Barton.&#xD;
Graham accepted the challenge. Barton, who was intimate&#xD;
with Col. Mac Neil, requested him to act as his second. The&#xD;
principals met, and Mac Neil's advice to Barton saved his life&#xD;
and killed Graham."&#xD;
"What was the advice?"&#xD;
"Don't aim, Barton, but raise your pistol .to a dead level&#xD;
with your stomach, and fire at the word."&#xD;
"Mac Neil'must be a very cool sort of person on such occi.-&#xD;

""it is much easier for the secor'ds to be cool than it is for&#xD;
the principals, I should suppose. This affair, and the noise&#xD;
about it,.made Mac Neil quite a hero among the girls-.-and all&#xD;
the young bloods about town, if they get into a quarrel when&#xD;
drunk, go to consult Mac Neil about their honor when they are&#xD;
sober. Keep on the right side of Colonel Mac Neil, Marion. I&#xD;
feel that he will be of use to you some day. I did think that&#xD;
Mr. Granville had an idea in his head to marry pretty Isa to&#xD;
Mae Neil. 'I don't think so now." Why, Marion, how you&#xD;
wince."&#xD;
"I-nonsense! What difference would it make to me ?&#xD;
But why would not Mr. Granville -marry Bell to Mac ?"  ''&#xD;
" Because Mac is getting on too fast for Mr. Granville. He&#xD;

wants Bell to marry a man who has got money and a steady&#xD;
business. Don't you begin life by falling in love with that lit-&#xD;
tle face. She is the most arrant little coquette in existence,&#xD;
and don't know her own mind ten minutes. Or if you do&#xD;
choose to let up a flirtation with her, don't make it serious,&#xD;
for she will marry at ten minutes' notice, any man 'Pa'&#xD;
chooses, and he will not choose you. Another prudent reason&#xD;
for not falling in love with Isabella is this-Mr.. Granville&#xD;
would make short work with your clerkship if it was to get to&#xD;
his ears. Prenez garde."&#xD;
Marion laughed, and' thanked Mrs. Nordheim for the Iform-&#xD;
tion she had given him, and then hurried down to the office.&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
Cows and Mocking Birds in South Carolina-Tke French Cofee House&#xD;
in Warren st., and its visitors,&#xD;
NEARLY a year had gone by since the close of the last&#xD;
chapter, and two years since the arrival of Marion in New&#xD;
York. Not a week had passed without his writing a letter to&#xD;
his parents, or receiving one from them, and every now and'&#xD;
then, he would get some present from home, to remind him that&#xD;
he Was not forgotten. He had remitted one hundred and sixty&#xD;
dollars to his. father.  The latter acknowledged its receipt,&#xD;
and while he thanked his son for sending it, declined to.use it&#xD;
for his own purpose.&#xD;
"We have no need of it, 'my son, but I have placed it where&#xD;
it will grow-in other words-cows are worth' here at present&#xD;
only eight dollars. I have bought and branded M M, twenty&#xD;
cows, and have 'registered them in the parish as yours. Four&#xD;
or five years hence my son will be quite a cattle proprietor.&#xD;
I have taken - to Charleston four cages, each containing a&#xD;
valuable mocking bird ; they will, be sent to you 'by the first&#xD;
ship."&#xD;
The ship arrived, and Marion gave one of the birds to&#xD;
Wilson, the book-keeper, one to M'rs. Nordheim, one: to&#xD;
Isabella Granville, and the fourth-Mr. Nordheim offered to&#xD;
buy it. Marion refused to sell it, but begged Mr. Nordheim&#xD;
to accept it, adding-&#xD;
" I have already given one to Mrs. Nordheim."&#xD;
"I aware of that, Marion, but I wish. you to procure the&#xD;

handsomest cage you can find,  Put my bird in it.  I will&#xD;
give you the address to which I wish it taken; and you shall&#xD;
accompany it with a note from me. I have -to ask an addition.&#xD;
al favor. You need notmention the circumstance of the bird,&#xD;
or any part of this conversation, or to whom I havd*given the&#xD;
bird."-&#xD;
"Certainly not, if you do not wish it."&#xD;
As the office was closing that night, Marion asked Mr.-&#xD;
Wilson if he would go and take a cup of coffee with him. The&#xD;
offer was accepted, and they . strolled off to No. 9 Warren&#xD;
street.  At-that time there was a French coffee-house! there,'&#xD;
kept by a sleepy-looking Frenchman named Blinn. When Mr.&#xD;
Wilson and Marion had taken their seats at one of the small&#xD;
tables, Marion ordered coffee and omelettes for two from&#xD;
Blinn himself, who attended to all orders. The order was&#xD;
given in French. Mr. Wilson remarked it.&#xD;
" Yes, I must confess that such is my anxiety to perfect my-&#xD;
self in French, that I come here every chance I get to prac-&#xD;
tice. There are some very remarkable men, Mr. Wilson, that&#xD;
visit this place daily. Fitz Green Halleck, the poet, who has&#xD;
rooms at 45 down the street ; Charles Fenno Hoffman, and&#xD;
several others. I have become well acquainted with Mr. Hal-&#xD;
leck, and have been to his rooms at Mr. Martine's, where he&#xD;
has roomed for fifteen years. I like him very much. With&#xD;
Mr. Hoffman I am not so well. acquainted. He must be pro&#xD;
paring himself for death or the mad-house."&#xD;
"Why do you think so ?"&#xD;
"]Because I have seen him drink at one sitting, and that&#xD;
not once, but a hundred timnes7-four or five cups of this French&#xD;
coffee, as strong as lye ; but that is not all. He places a large&#xD;
luip of sugar in a teaspoon, puts it across the top of his cup&#xD;
over the. coffee,.then pours over it a wine glass of Kirchwas-&#xD;
ser, and burns it, the sugar melting and running into the cof-&#xD;
fee. It is a devil's dose, is it not ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I should think so, if old Lucifer ever stimulates. I&#xD;
should think a few such cups of coffee, with the burnt sugar&#xD;
and Kirchwasser, would waken the old chap up."''&#xD;
" While we are waiting for our omelette I propose tQ read&#xD;
you a letter from my father," and Marion read the letter about&#xD;
cows and mocking birds.&#xD;
"Cows are cheap in South Carolina, are they not?"&#xD;
" Extremely so. But it costs nothing to keep them. If my&#xD;
father does as he says, (and I' never knew him do otherwise,) I&#xD;
mnay own a hundred cows before five years are over."&#xD;
&#xD;
Tell&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR. 0&#xD;
"It will cost some taoney and fodder to keep such a stock&#xD;
in the winter," observed Mr. Wilson,&#xD;
"Not a cent. Those cows will go off in the woods, and&#xD;
perhaps not be seen until next spring. Then father will hunt&#xD;
them upi for they will run with his stock. They will be found&#xD;
with calves ; all the bull calves will be selected, fattened, and&#xD;
sent to Charleston, where they will bring seven dollars each.&#xD;
The heifer calves will be branded M. M., and turned adrift&#xD;
again with their mothers and the bulls."&#xD;
"1How do you manage to keep them out of your neighbor's&#xD;
land?  Do they break down fences ?"&#xD;
" Fences! Fences are somewhat rare in the great swamps&#xD;
and forests in South Carolina. Our neighbors do as we do&#xD;
with their cattle, and they feed themselves from one end of&#xD;
the year to the other. 'We only keep up a few cows for milk-&#xD;
ing purposes.  Why, we raise hogs and colts in the same&#xD;
manner. What do you think 'of Mr. Nordheim's asking me for&#xD;
a mocking bird extra, eh ?"&#xD;
"II think he intended to give it to his mistress."&#xD;
"His mistress !" and Marion jumped up;. "mistress! what,&#xD;
does he keep a mistress ?"&#xD;
"A mistress. By the Lord Harry I don't think re keeps, a&#xD;
mistress, I think it more likely that he keeps three. or four.&#xD;
You seem.perfectly astonished."&#xD;
"I am, and can hardly credit it. His wife knows nothing&#xD;
of it."&#xD;
"I dare say not. At least I should presume it would not&#xD;
be a very frequent or agreeable subject of conversation in the&#xD;
family circle between man and wife.  Don't you remember&#xD;
about four months ago asking me about a beautiful girl with&#xD;
light hair that called to get some money ?"&#xD;
"Very well.' She was a beauty, I do rememberr"&#xD;
"That was one of the mistresses of- our worthy Mr. Nord-&#xD;
heim, and she occupies a handsome two-story house in Broome&#xD;
street, not far from Hudson.  Nordheim has had her about a&#xD;
year. He picked her up somewhere in the country; and pays&#xD;
house rent, furniture bills, &amp;amp;c.' for her."&#xD;
"It is a shame and a sin," said Marion,&#xD;
",Not at all.  Nordheim* is rich, and the firm is coining&#xD;
money. He can afford it, and if a man can't do what he pleases&#xD;
with his own money, what is the world coming to in a-financial&#xD;
point of view ? I dare say you will see the lady with your&#xD;
own eyes, for I judge that the junior partner intends that you&#xD;
shall carry the bird up to Miss Norris, for that is her name.&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
Don't those birds cost your father some money ? I would not&#xD;
take twenty dollars for the bird you gave me. I have him hung&#xD;
up in Clark &amp;amp; Brown's bar-room, and the chap goes it with a&#xD;
perfect looseness."&#xD;
"No, they are as thick at Nonck's Corners as robins are&#xD;
here in the Spring. They build nests all about our house, and&#xD;
as soon as they are hatched, we take the nest and put it into a&#xD;
cage. The old birds follow, anA then they feed the young&#xD;
birds in the cage until they are able to fly. Then we have to&#xD;
be careful--for the old birds, when they find their young old&#xD;
enough to fly, and unable to get out, go into the woods and&#xD;
select some poisonous berries, which they administer, and kill&#xD;
the little birds, if not prevented."&#xD;
"That is queer, and-bad in a financial point of view. It is&#xD;
getting late, and I must go," said Wilson.&#xD;
Marion was extremely embarrassed when. he reached Bond&#xD;
street. le had made a discovery in reference to Mr. Nord-'&#xD;
heim that he would prefer not to have made. He felt guilty&#xD;
himself, and when Mrs. Nordheim asked him what the matter&#xD;
was, or if anything unpleasant had happened, he tried to laugh&#xD;
it off, and only made matters worse. Finally, he voucluded&#xD;
that come what would, he would keep the secret, and Mts-&#xD;
Nordheim remarked, "Very well, Marion, you have made a&#xD;
discovery of some kind that affects me, and you will not tell&#xD;
,ne what it is, That is not brotherly. I am the test friend&#xD;
you have in the world, and you ought to trust me as such."&#xD;
When each retired for the night, there was a certain degree&#xD;
of coldness. Marion felt that he must regain. her. confidence-&#xD;
at any cost.&#xD;
CHAPTER      XIUI.&#xD;
The Home of the Kept Matress-The Opinion of/a Wife of her Husband's Follies.&#xD;
TRUE to his word, the next-morning Mr. Nordheim, who was&#xD;
absent from breakfast at his own house, met Marion at the office,&#xD;
and handed him a note. It was addressed to "Miss C. Norris,&#xD;
No. 591 Broome street."&#xD;
"Did you get the cage as Iwished ?" he asked.&#xD;
"I did, sir," replied Marion.&#xD;
"Take the porter and go with it and the bird to the number&#xD;
where this note is addressed. 'Send him off when you reach&#xD;
&#xD;
'I.&#xD;
&#xD;
pA&#xD;
&#xD;
there, aid deliver the note yourself to the lady with. the bird&#xD;
and cage," said Mr. Nordheim.&#xD;
Not many hours elapsed before Marion was at the resi-&#xD;
dence designated. He inquired for the lady, and a negro&#xD;
girl received- the bird cage, and asked Marion  into the&#xD;
parlor  He handed the note to the girl, and bade her take&#xD;
it up to her mistress with the cage and bird. While she was&#xD;
doing this errand, he had time to look around the parlor. It-was&#xD;
-luxuriously furnished, a double parlor, with mahogany doors&#xD;
between, whicl were furnished precisely alike. The walls were&#xD;
covered with paintings, that at a glance Marion knew to be -by&#xD;
the old masters. The carpets were so thick that you hardly&#xD;
heard your own footstep. In both the front and back parlors&#xD;
were centre tables of black Egyptian marble, and they were&#xD;
Covered with books, bound in the most costly style of binding.&#xD;
Sofas, lounges and ottomans were in every part of the parlor,&#xD;
and covered with the most costly blue velvet. Marion had no&#xD;
time for further examination, for the girl returned and said,&#xD;
"Missus wants you to come up stairs." Marion followed her,&#xD;
and was shown into a sleeping room extending the whole&#xD;
width of the house on the front part of the second story. His&#xD;
eye rented upon the same beautiful face that he had seen once&#xD;
before, and he recognized her at-once. There was a splendid&#xD;
bedstead in the room, but the hlady was dressed in a rich silk&#xD;
dressing-gown, and reclined upon a lounge near one of the&#xD;
windows. She raised her head as Marion entered. In her hand&#xD;
she held the note, and by her side upon the floor was the cage&#xD;
and bird.&#xD;
"Oh it is You, Mr. Marion, you do not know how very glad&#xD;
I am to see you. Mr. Nordheim has often spoke of you, and&#xD;
I have to thank you for for this charming present. There,&#xD;
don't say a word. I know all about it. Come and sit down by&#xD;
me. Do you know that I had to threaten Mr. Nordheim before&#xD;
he would consent that you should come up here I"&#xD;
Marion bowed and took the seat.&#xD;
"9I have not had my breakfast. -Do ring that bell, and you&#xD;
must take a cap of coffee with me."&#xD;
Marion was about to decline, but the impetuous girl declared&#xD;
he should. The negress came in, and she ordered a double&#xD;
breakfast. She gazed at Marion.&#xD;
"How old are you ?"&#xD;
"I shall be seventeen before many mouths are over."&#xD;
" You aire handsome and good, and I shall like you very&#xD;
much. There, don't blush and look foolish. Wait until yon&#xD;

hear me through. You know my relations with Mr. Nordheim.&#xD;
-There-don't say a word-that is enough.  Mr. Nordheini is&#xD;
kind-very kind-yet he is very jealous. There are things&#xD;
that I need-must have-I crave them. I will have them. I&#xD;
crave knowledge. I read-read-read every thing that I can&#xD;
get hold of.  You see what a quantity of'books I have gt"-.&#xD;
(the room was littered up with-books~.)  I have read them all.&#xD;
Mr.hNordheim says that you are learning different languages.&#xD;
Is that so&#xD;
Yes, madam- I am learning languages."&#xD;
How many have you acquired ?"&#xD;
"Two-Dutch and French. 'I am now learnIng German. I&#xD;
nmean-to learn more before I have finished,"' observed Marion&#xD;
in reply&#xD;
That is capital. T am crazy to learn French, German, Spa-&#xD;
nisb, and Italian. Now tell me, how do you manage ?"&#xD;
Marion related to her his mode of Isarning a language.&#xD;
"1You have given me a new idea, and I shall not lose it.&#xD;
But now answer me another question. I cannot go about to&#xD;
coffee houses and French places. How can I acquire the pro-&#xD;
nunciationT I know-don't talk. I must have a teacher.&#xD;
Now you can find me a proper person who can teach me&#xD;
French, German, or Spanish. I know you can. Nordheim&#xD;
says so, and he is willing that I shall have one of your selec-&#xD;
.tion. Why, Marion, you are handsome! What a fool Nord-&#xD;
hehm is, to be sure.* He might with reason be ten times more&#xD;
jealous of you than any man he has ever brought. here yet."&#xD;
Marion looked confused.&#xD;
"You need not be afraid of me, Marion. I know your posi-&#xD;
tion at the home of Mr. Nordhein  I will not mention the&#xD;
name of that lady-it is too pure for my lips. I hope she is&#xD;
Jappy. There-don't say any thing. You can serve me in&#xD;
many ways. 'Will you ? That is enough. I frequently need&#xD;
money. Nordheim will always give it to you, or I-will write&#xD;
a note -to you when I want any special favor. Now about the&#xD;
teacher. Will you find one -for me'?  Some oldish man who.,&#xD;
is poor."  Marion promised that he would do so. "Find one,&#xD;
if 'you can, who can teach me several languages-.&amp;amp;a German,&#xD;
Pole, or Russian. I understand those people speak three or&#xD;
four languages equally well. Did you notice my piano in the&#xD;
rear parlor? If I was dressed and down stairs I wonld play&#xD;
and sing to you. Nordheim has had me taught me the piano,&#xD;
and to sing-also to play on the guitar an accompaniment t'o&#xD;
myself when I sing. Oh what pleasure ! I should not have&#xD;

been allowed to learn that, but I could have woman to teach&#xD;
me those accomplishments. Pshaw ! what am I talking about.&#xD;
You don't understand such restraints," said Miss Norris. Ma-&#xD;
rion did, though. He was wiser than she thought. " What&#xD;
delight that bird will give me! What shall I call him?  Oh,&#xD;
I know-Marion. That's a good pame. I want you to get me&#xD;
a quantity of books-will you ? You say 'Yes.' Iwill serd&#xD;

Nordheim. Look, here is my hand..riting. What do you&#xD;

came acquainted with him, I could not write my own name&#xD;
I have cause to be grateful to him for some things, if not for&#xD;
others. Now I know you are anxious to get off to that horri-&#xD;
ble office. Here is the breakfast. Help me tordevour that,&#xD;
and then you may go. hNothtillthen.",She poured out a CUP&#xD;
of coffee, made him eat some nice toast, and when he had fin-&#xD;
ished said, "Now you may go, Marion, but have mercy upon&#xD;
my mania to learn French, and get' me a teachersuitable to&#xD;
my circumstances."  Marion promised, and soon after tookhis&#xD;
leave. The reader who remembers chapter eighth of this book&#xD;
will not need to be reminded that the country girl Clara Nor-&#xD;
ris, .wh eighteen months previous had been brought by Mr.&#xD;
ris wh0i  e&#xD;
Nordheim to the city, and who was then innocent and igno-&#xD;
rant, was now the luxuriously located, and the well read and&#xD;
somewhat literary kept mistress. Nordheim had.bestowed&#xD;
upon her every accomplishment that he could, consistently&#xD;
with his jealousy of male teachers. Miss Norris had led a life&#xD;
of seclusion, and devoted herself to study and to reading. Her&#xD;
mind was maturing for the most deadly purposes. She was&#xD;
armed with beauty, and needed but the sharper weapons&#xD;
which the mind's accomplishment would give er, to make her&#xD;
vengeance felt whenever she should repay upon  ancthe in-&#xD;
jury she had received from his, sex.  Mariotrefected well&#xD;
upon his position as he walked from Brond street down tud.&#xD;
son, and when he reached St. John's Park oneof the gateswas&#xD;
open, and he passed in and took a seat in an arbor. There he&#xD;
remained over an hour, endeavoring to satisfy his ownucon-&#xD;
science as to what was right and proper for him to do uIler&#xD;
the peculiar circumstance in which he was placed. "I am&#xD;
'living in the house with~ the pure wife of my employer. Shen&#xD;

only person affected is the wife--and situated as I am, in 'the&#xD;
house with her, I will not lose her confidence, come what  rill'&#xD;
If she acts upon what I shall tell her, why then, there will be&#xD;
a pretty general smash up and breaking of things, and I must&#xD;
take my'chance." He found Mr. Nordheim at the office. The&#xD;
latter quietly enquired if he delivered the bird and note, and&#xD;
when answered in the affirmative, made no further comment.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson, the book-keeper, nodded to Marion and whis-&#xD;
pered, "Been up in Broome street, eh ? Expensive in a finan-&#xD;
cial point of view, eh ?" Marion smiled and went at his work.&#xD;
When evening came he hurried home, and although anxious,&#xD;
yet as he opened the door of the tea-room in a cheerful man-&#xD;
ner, he caught the attention of Mrs. Nordheimn, who congratu-&#xD;
lated him in being in .so good Spirits. "I.am, dear Bessy,&#xD;
and I will tell you why."&#xD;
She gazed into-his face a moment, and then said, "Tell me&#xD;
why.".&#xD;
"Because I am placed in an awkward situation. I have&#xD;
not shown that confidence in you that I ought to have done.&#xD;
Come what will, after tea I want you to go up in my room. I&#xD;
have some writing to do, and when we get up there you shall&#xD;
know all.". She smiled. Tea was soon over, and Marion went&#xD;
to his rpom.  He was soon followed by Mrs. Nordheim.&#xD;
Now be seated, Bessy, and I will tell you all that I have&#xD;
kept from you. It may make trouble, but you shall never say I&#xD;
concealed any thing from you, in any way or shape, or look&#xD;
coldly upon me as you did last night." Marion took her hand&#xD;
and told her all. Every thing that Nordheim-..her husband&#xD;
had said and done, and all about the beautiful mistress and her'&#xD;
well furnished home.  She never spoke 'a word. "Well,&#xD;
Bessy, what is the matter ? Why don't you say something ?&#xD;
Are you angry with me ?"&#xD;
No, no. God bless you, Marion. You have made me very,&#xD;
very happy by what you have told me. I could not bear the&#xD;
thought that my loved brother-my Marion, my friend, that I&#xD;
would trust with life, could be a traitor and keep back any se-&#xD;
crets from me. No-angry ? No. Why should I be with&#xD;
you? But I should'have been outraged if you had not told&#xD;
me. So they would get you into the meshes of that lady,&#xD;
would they'?"&#xD;
Marion was astonished, and asked, Well, Bessy; it don't&#xD;
seem to annoy you at all, what I have told you ?"&#xD;
She mailed. "Brother mine,- I have known it all along.&#xD;

All I cared about was your learning what- I already knew, and&#xD;
keeping it a secret from .me that you did know it.  As for&#xD;
that girl--or Mr. Nordheim, I don't care the weight of a&#xD;

I married him to obtain two thousand dollars' a year. It is&#xD;

many married women as he sees fit. It is none of my business&#xD;
so long as he don't sport them in my face, or bring them into&#xD;
my house. Now that perfect confidence is restored -between&#xD;
YOU and me, I rather like the idea that Mr. Nordheim should&#xD;
have selected you to get books and language teachers for Miss&#xD;
Clara. It will be extremely funny for us to know how my moral&#xD;
husband progresses. But Marion, mind you "-what she was&#xD;
gto say-whether to caution Marion against leing en-&#xD;
trapped in the golden hair of Miss Clara, it is not our province&#xD;
to reckon. "Marion, you may kiss me to-night as long as you&#xD;
please."  Marion drew her upon' his knees, unfastened her&#xD;
hair, and availed himself of her offer, saying, as' he almost&#xD;
smothered her with his loving caresses, "Dear Bessy, I im-&#xD;
agined you would be outrageously angry with Mr.' Nordheim&#xD;
and the lady, and that at least you would get a divorce or do&#xD;
something very dreadful. I am agreeably disappointed?"&#xD;
"Marion, you need not have had any. such fears. He is not&#xD;
Worth the trouble. Now stop hissing me. Go to work at your&#xD;
desk.  It is nearly twelve o'clock, and I must go to bed, for I&#xD;
am weary and tired. Good night,, Marion; you have shown&#xD;
that you are a dear good brother, and I will never be angry&#xD;
again with you a moment. So she told you that you were very&#xD;

She left the room, and he went to work with his pen.&#xD;

visited that city, but what wili remember it. The rooms were&#xD;
spacious, and crowded with guests, who comprised some of the&#xD;
oldest and best families in Maryland. There-was more beauty&#xD;
in that assembly than had been gathered together for many&#xD;
years. Washington, the capital, had sent down several guests,&#xD;
among whom was the venerable President, whose slight figure&#xD;
an4l stern military aspect made all who approached him pause.&#xD;
with respect and reverence. It was General Jackson. Several&#xD;
senators and members of the House, of Representatives had&#xD;
come down with him.&#xD;
. There had been a wedding at five o'clock that afternoon in&#xD;
the Cathedral, and Archbishop Eccleston had performed the&#xD;
ceremony which made Thomas Granville the husband of Cathe-&#xD;
rine Pinckney. The venerable edifice was crowded with spec-&#xD;
tators, who had been invited to the wedding, for Granville had&#xD;
troops of friends, and the beautiful and accomplished bride&#xD;
had been the belle of Baltimore. She had refused scores of&#xD;
offers, for she had long given her heart to Tom. To be refused&#xD;
by Kate Pinckney was a part of a Baltimore young man's edu-&#xD;
cati6n. His education was not deemed complete unless he&#xD;
had offered his hand and been refused by Kate. The more&#xD;
intimate friends had. been invited to a large evening party at&#xD;
the Castle, given by the venerable grandmother of the bride,&#xD;
whose age was nearly ninety, and yet she-was as gay and as&#xD;
lively as any one of the youngest in that gay party. She was&#xD;
the widow of one of the signers of the Declaration of Indepen-&#xD;
dence, but had outlived her worthy husband half a century.&#xD;
She was rich, and although eccentric, and at times very penu-&#xD;
rious, yet when a favorite grandchildImarried, she spared no&#xD;
pain-:;.or expense to make a brilliant display. A daughter had&#xD;
married one of the most gallant of our commodores in the last&#xD;
war, and front this marriage came seven lovely girls and two&#xD;
sons. It was one- of those beautiful girls whose marriage had&#xD;
taken place that day.&#xD;
All the other sisters were present, and their names were&#xD;
somewhat remarkable. The mother had named the younger&#xD;
daughters after leading men.,There was Miss Madison Pinck-&#xD;
ney, next to Kate in years; then came Miss Monroe Pinek-&#xD;
ney, Clay Pinckney, andrCalhoun Pinckney. The sisters,. from&#xD;
the eldest, Kate, to the youngest, Calhoun Pinckney, were not&#xD;
less celebrated for their beauty than their superior education&#xD;
and accomplishments. Their father, when alive, had been a&#xD;
devoted friend of General Jackson, and the mother was not&#xD;
less so after his death. Hence the presence of the President&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR,&#xD;

OF&#xD;

&#xD;
on this occasion. He was in good spirits, and seemed as happy&#xD;
as though no cares of State, no United States Bank, or no dis-&#xD;
union troubles preyed upon his mind. He even danced areel&#xD;
with the venerable old dame, whose age lacked but five years&#xD;
of reaching a century. The President offered his congratula-&#xD;
tions to the bride and her husband with a hearty good-will, and&#xD;
observed to the bridegroom,&#xD;
I Tom, I understand that you are about to engage in mer-&#xD;
cantile business in New York. I hope you will be successful;&#xD;
but merchandizing is but a species of gambling, and should your&#xD;
'not succeed,.come and see me."&#xD;
Tom had visited Washington---he had told stories and anec-&#xD;
.dotes, sung songs at the President's fireside, and made many&#xD;
a glomy, anxious hour pass merrily to the old hero, with whom&#xD;
he became a great favorite. "Come and se6 me " meant&#xD;
woi-lds when it came from Andrew Jackson's lips ; and when,&#xD;
not many years after, Tom did go and se the old man at the&#xD;
White House, he made him' dine with him; and when Tom&#xD;
felt almost discouraged at his future prospects being so gloomy,&#xD;
and was about leaving after the dinner, General Jackson told&#xD;
him to wait a moment. Tom complied, and walked to one of&#xD;
the windows that overlooked the -Potomac. The President&#xD;
touched his elbow.&#xD;
"Tom, that recitation you gave after dinner, which yo say&#xD;
is from a play of our friend Howaid Payne, was very good--&#xD;
very capital. Appropriate to Jou, Tom, eh ?  Pronounce it&#xD;
again here. I like it."&#xD;
Tom repeated:&#xD;
"I can believe that beauty, such as thine&#xD;
ay possess a thousand fascinatingsnares to lure the&#xD;
Wavering-and confound the weak; but, what is his&#xD;
Honor, that a sigh can shake, or his virtue, that a&#xD;
Tear can move? Truth.,valor, justice, constancy&#xD;
Of soul, these are the attributes of manly natures.&#xD;
Be woman e'er so beauteous, manwas born for&#xD;
Nobler purposes than to be her slave."&#xD;
"So he was, Tom--so he was. You and Kate have parted.&#xD;
Very bad*'d----d bad. But, cheer up. What do you intend&#xD;
to do? Brother won't help you, eh ?"&#xD;
"No, General, he will not. I beli*e I am abandoned by&#xD;
all.-.have got no friends. Don't know what I shall do, unless&#xD;
Ii turn actor."&#xD;
"Tu  would make a first rate actor, Tom, but wait a while.&#xD;
You are wild, Tomn---everybody says so----I think so myself.&#xD;
But you must keep straight with me. Haive you any money 2"&#xD;

"No, General, not fifty cents."&#xD;
I will give you thirty dollars-lend it to you. To-marrow&#xD;
I 1will send your name into the Senate for confirmation as&#xD;
consul to the second city in France. Here is the money to get&#xD;
out of this place with. Come and see me before you go abroad.&#xD;
You will have plenty of friends as soon as your appointment&#xD;
is in the Globe. Good-bye."&#xD;
But we are getting in advance of our narrative. Our read-&#xD;
ers must return from this little digression to the wedding'&#xD;
party and supper. -All $he Granville family were there, ex-&#xD;
cept Mrs. Pitt Granville. Mr. W. Pitt Granville, his son Wal-&#xD;
ter, and his daughter Isabel, had come on from New York to&#xD;
be present at the wedding. Isabel was one of the six brides.&#xD;
maids of aunt Kate..-her sisters and Miss Benson making the'&#xD;
other five. Walter was making the best use of his time with&#xD;
Miss Madison Pinckney, with whom it may not be out of place&#xD;
to mention that he was desperately in love-and these young&#xD;
people were* actually engaged to be married. This was a secret&#xD;
kept from the elder Granville, who would-have murdered his&#xD;
son in cold blood if he had suspected such a thing for an in-&#xD;
stant. Miss Margaret Benson, a daughter of Colonel Benson,&#xD;
had come on with the party from New York, as a friend of&#xD;
Isabella and her aunt Kate. She acted as one of the brides-&#xD;
inaids, as before stated.&#xD;
'Tom had six chosen friends from New York who acted as&#xD;
his groomsmen. The first was Colonel W. Mac Neil; the oth-&#xD;
ers were Doctor;Carnochan, a young surgeon who at that pe-&#xD;
riod had but little else to do than attend weddings, or any&#xD;
other amusing affair, though now the leading surgeon of the&#xD;
country, if not of the world. A third was an Englishman of&#xD;
good family, a Mr. Sidney ilerbert Cedar, whd wrote tales for&#xD;
magazines, and gained by  hook or crook a living." The fourth&#xD;
was Mr. Francis Popinjay, who lived off his wits and his wife's&#xD;
allowance from out of a bankrupt estate swindled out of the&#xD;
Government by a notorious tea importer. The fifth was a cha-&#xD;
racter well known in New York as Colonel Le Grand Peacock,&#xD;
and the sixth was Walter Granville, Tom's nephew.&#xD;
All the New York visitors were putting up 'at Barnum's&#xD;
Hotel, and late at night, when the party at the Castle was&#xD;
broken up, another elegant repast was spread by direction of&#xD;
Mr. Granville, under Barnum's superintendence. Some of the&#xD;
guests kept it up until daylight, in the long dining-room of the&#xD;
hotel&#xD;
It was decided that immediately after the wedding, the&#xD;
&#xD;
bridal party should return to New York, and then the bride&#xD;
and groom should go to housekeeping at once, in a housa pre-&#xD;
pared by Mr. W. P. Granville, and there .spend their honey-&#xD;
moon. We ought here to mention, that the engagement be-&#xD;
tween Thomas Granville and Kate Pinckney had 'been of some&#xD;
duration. It would have been still longer, had not Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville senior opened a negotiation with the venerable grandmo-&#xD;
ther of the" bride. Mr. W. Pitt Granville agreed that imme-&#xD;
diately after the wedding he would take Tom into the firm of&#xD;
Granville and Nordheim, and give him an interest in the busi-&#xD;
ness; and the relict of the signer of the Declaration, who -was&#xD;
a shrewd business woman in her way, agreed to place $25,000&#xD;
in the concern for Tom, if he kept steady and devoted to busi-&#xD;
ness one year. This proved a prudent and safe clause.&#xD;
The elder Granville was delighted with the wedding. He&#xD;
saw hope for his favorite brother, "Master Tom," as he called&#xD;
him, and he never dreamed.that Tom would sport with such&#xD;
brilliant prospects, or pursue a course that would dash his&#xD;
hopes to the ground. The elder Granville confessed to Col-&#xD;
onel Mac Neil that he had never witnessed a bridal that opened&#xD;
with such brilliant prospects as that of his brother. Tom was&#xD;
gifted, clever and amiable, and although somewhat eccentric&#xD;
and extremely lazy, yet Mr. Granville concluded that when.he&#xD;
became the husband of the brilliant, beautiful, and well de-&#xD;
seended. Kate Pinckney-one who brought money to him and&#xD;
a powerful connexion--one who actually worshipped the very&#xD;
ground which Tom trod upon, and whom Tom professed to love&#xD;
deeply and devotedly in return, they would be happy. These&#xD;
were hopeful prospects for the new beginners in married life;&#xD;
and what would have been the fate of any one of the brilliant&#xD;
crowd at that wedding, ifhe or she had prophesied that ere one&#xD;
year had passed, Tom would have left business and his brother,&#xD;
.separated from his wife, so recently a bride, and that in. that&#xD;
space of time she would have applied for a divorce, and that&#xD;
ere two years had passed, it would have been granted by the&#xD;
Legislature of Maryland. Such is life, under the most happy&#xD;
auspices.&#xD;
'I'he-morning after the wedding, all of the party that had&#xD;
come on from New York returned thither with the bride and&#xD;
groom ; and as soon as they arrived in that city, Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Tom Granville left for Niagara Falls.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
The Supper at the City Botel--The Count Falsechinski'&#xD;
MAnioN did not go to Baltimore to attend the wedding of&#xD;
Thomas Granville, although the latter gave him a cordial invi-&#xD;
tation to do so. His opinion of Tom was not very flattering to&#xD;
that gentleman in a business point of view. He thought that&#xD;
Tom was gifted, could tell a good story'and sing a song very&#xD;
prettily ; but in all other respects he regarded him as a very&#xD;
light and silly fellow. le had a good excuse for not accepting&#xD;
the invitation to the wedding.. In the first, place the elder&#xD;
Granville would not hhve allowed Marion to leave the counting&#xD;
room when he himself was absent. He was now seventeen&#xD;
years of age--almost fully developed in stature, and 'his fea-&#xD;
tures possessed a dignity that made, him appear older than he&#xD;
really 'Was. Two years and a half in the countinor-roon had&#xD;
made quite a change in the South Carolina boy. He -had been&#xD;
promoted step by step for his devotion to business, and now he&#xD;
ranked next to Mr. Wilson, the head clerk or book-keeper.&#xD;
Marion entered vessels and goods at the Custom House when&#xD;
they came consigned.to the firm; he made sales of merchand-&#xD;
ize, purchased produce for foreign orders, and chartered ves-&#xD;
sels when needed. He also wrote most of the domestic busi-&#xD;
ness letters of the firm, and not a few foreign ones.  He had&#xD;
assisted Mr. Wilson so often with his books, that he told Ma-&#xD;
rion as a great mark of his esteem and respect, "Marion, if I&#xD;
were to die, the best thing the firm could -do in a financial&#xD;
point of view, would be to put you in my place.  You- can&#xD;
keep th9 book's as well as I can."&#xD;
Mr. Nordheim did not go to tho wedding. He was obliged&#xD;
to remain and sign checks and papers during the absence of&#xD;
Mr. Granville. Marion, since his interview with Miss Norris,&#xD;
had received several notes from her, giving him  commissions&#xD;
to purchase books, papers, journals, and many other things.&#xD;
He had frequently taken them up to. her himself, and' some-.&#xD;
times sent a note, with the article ordered, by the porter.. Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim had frequently given him money to pay for such or-&#xD;
ders, and sometimes two hundred dollars were called-for in&#xD;
one sum. He never refused a demand from that quarter, and&#xD;
&#xD;
H&#xD;
I&#xD;
'&#xD;
&#xD;
67&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
thanked Marion for relieving him of trouble and bother. He&#xD;
was really grateful.&#xD;
Marion had made several attempts to procure a proper per-&#xD;
son as teacher of languages to Miss Norris, but the summer&#xD;
and autumn had passed since the request was made, and he&#xD;
had been unsuccessful. He almost despaired of finding one,&#xD;
and he wrote an apologetic note to that effect. The reply was,&#xD;
"Don't give it up. I will wait."&#xD;
"(After the return of Mr. Granville from the wedding at&#xD;
Baltimore, Marion was relieved from many duties that became&#xD;
his while Mr. Granville was absent, and he found more leisure&#xD;
to attend to his own studies and amusements.~ About a month&#xD;
after the marriage, he was invited by Colonel Mac Neil to pay,&#xD;
him a visit at his room in the City  notel, and to meet a few&#xD;
friends. Marion accepted the invitation, and at nine o'clock,&#xD;
was at the place designated. The Colonel had invited a dozen&#xD;
people to a supper which was arranged to come- off in his own&#xD;
parlor, for he had a handsome suite of rooms in the City Ho-&#xD;
tel, which was then kept by Chester Jennings,.and was the&#xD;
principal hotel in New York. It was here that all the great&#xD;
balls and famous dinners came off, and it was at the City Hotel&#xD;
that strangers of any note stopped when they came to the city.&#xD;
The supper was 'truly a recherche affair, and did credit to&#xD;
the Colonel's good taste in ordering it. It is -a secret that few&#xD;
men possess, but Col. Mac Neil was - an old traveller. . There&#xD;
were present at it several bloods and fast young men of the&#xD;
town, and they drank, sang, and seemed to enjoy themselves&#xD;
amazingly. Dr. Carnochan was at the table, and so was Mr.&#xD;
Cedar, the story writer; and to these gentlemen Marion was&#xD;
formally   resented. There was a Mr. Wolcott, a son of an&#xD;
ex-Governor of Connecticut,. a foreign count with an unpro-&#xD;
nounceable name, and an Irish gentleman, that Mae introduced&#xD;
to Marion as Mr. John O'Doemall. After the supper had been&#xD;
disposed of, the Colonel introduced cards, and parties were&#xD;
made up in different parts, of the room. Marion was- seated.&#xD;
near the foreign Count, and as he noticed that he did not seem&#xD;
disposed to join himself to any of the parties at the card tables,&#xD;
he determined to form a more intimate acquaintance, and asked,&#xD;
Count, do you not intend to play?"&#xD;
"No sare."&#xD;
I believe I was introduced to you in a somewhat informal&#xD;
manner by our host, but your name -escaped me. May I ask&#xD;
"Thuo e Coun Atdolphus Falsechinski, at your servie, sare."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

68&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Count, I am really pleased to make your acquaintance ;&#xD;
and Marion opened upon him in French. The Count spoke it&#xD;
like a French native. Dutch-low Dutch came next. That&#xD;
the Count was at home in, and you could not doubt but that&#xD;
be had lived in the Netherlands from boyhood. The Count&#xD;
was equally pleased to find some one who could speak Nether-&#xD;
land Dutch, as it was a somewhat rare accomplishment in New&#xD;
York.&#xD;
"Pray, sir Count, are you a Dutch Count ?"&#xD;
"No sare.-I am a Polish nobleman. I left my own country&#xD;
after the late revolution."&#xD;
"Then you speak other languages-perbaps better, if that&#xD;
were possible, than you do Dutch, French, or English."&#xD;
"Sare, I speak the English, the French, the German, the&#xD;
Russian, the Danish, the Spanish, the Italian, the Portuguese,&#xD;
the Holland Dutch, and of course the language. of my own&#xD;
beautiful loved countrywhich is Polish. I am also a good&#xD;
Greek as well as LIatin scholar, and having resided in Greece&#xD;
some time, I speak the modern Greek."&#xD;
Marion bowed to the Count with the most profound respect,&#xD;
and the thought came to him that it was extremely unfortunate&#xD;
that the Count was not poor, as he would be just the person to&#xD;
engage as langua-ge teacher to Miss Norris. He took a good&#xD;
look at the Count, and examined his dress. le wore white&#xD;
pantaloons. It was January, and the night was bitter cold;&#xD;
but Counts and other distinguished foreigners are permitted&#xD;
to do queer things. Still Marion would not have been much&#xD;
less surprised had the Count wore no unmentionables at all.&#xD;
The coat was a military arrangement, and buttoned close up to&#xD;
the throat. Although it was warm in the room, yet the coat&#xD;
clasped its owner closely, and showed no signs of unbuttoning.&#xD;
Conversation commenced again, and Marion devoted himself to&#xD;
the Count until the party broke up. Occasionally he watched&#xD;
the hack of the players, and particularly the Colonel. He&#xD;
could not exactly tell who was the winner, until he heard the&#xD;
Count remark,,&#xD;
"Ah, what a happy dog ! The Colonel Mac Neil has won&#xD;
three thousand dollars this evening. It will pay for many&#xD;
suppers."&#xD;
As the guests of the Colonel were passing through the ball&#xD;
of the hotel, Marion found himself walking by 'the side of the&#xD;
handsome Count.&#xD;
"Do you go up or down town ?" he asked.&#xD;
" Up," replied the Count.&#xD;
&#xD;
v "I&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.OR&#xD;
"And as I am going the same .way, suppose we keep each&#xD;
other company&#xD;
"It will give me the very greatest of pleasure' to do so,"&#xD;
said the Count ; and so they walked up Broadway. It was a&#xD;
bitter cold night. Marion wore a thick overcoat,- bat before&#xD;
the two pedestrians had got as far as Canal street, he was al-&#xD;
most perished. The Count 'had no cloak or overcoat, but he&#xD;
did not seem to feel the cold.- Marion chatted away about the&#xD;
parties with whom they had spent the 'evening, and the Count&#xD;
gave him a great quantity of very useful information. He was&#xD;
quite indignant that the young blades who lost their money&#xD;
should have been so green as to lose it to Colonel Mao Neil.&#xD;
"I am sure, Count, from some of your remarks, that you&#xD;
understand 'bluff' better or as well as any gentleman who was&#xD;
in that parlor. How comes it then that you did not play and&#xD;
win some money yourself-?"&#xD;
The Count replied that there were many reasons, and some&#xD;
day perhaps Marion would be convinced that one reason alone&#xD;
was enough to prevent his playing.&#xD;
The wind blew down Broadway so cold and so piercing, and&#xD;
withal so wild and fierce, that Marion remarked it could not&#xD;
have long left the region of the. frozen North, where 'icebergs&#xD;
.abounded.  On, on they went up Broadway.     Prince and&#xD;
Houston streets were passed, and when thqy came to the cor-&#xD;
ner of Bond street, Marion stopped, remarking,&#xD;
"Well, Count, we must part here, for I turn up this street&#xD;
to the Bowery."&#xD;
"So do I," answered the Count.&#xD;
The weather seemed to become more intensely cold. They&#xD;
reached the residence of Mr. Nordheim. Again Marion stop-&#xD;
ped-so did the Count. "At' last I am home," said the for-&#xD;
mer. " How much farther are you going, Count ?" demanded&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
"Me ?-.well, I really don't know. I shall walk down town&#xD;
again, and if I do not find some place open that keeps open all&#xD;
night, I shall have to keep walking, unless I get so very cold&#xD;
as to make it necessary for me to warm mny toes  the watch-&#xD;
house."&#xD;
M Varion was thunderstruck. "Count, I wish you to come in.&#xD;
I have a good fire in my room. It is too cold to talk out here."&#xD;
The Count declined.&#xD;
" Psha ! no nonsense with me--you don't know me. Youn&#xD;
can rest yourself a few moments, and then if you wish 'to go,&#xD;
you shall. It is near two o'clock.&#xD;

&#xD;
The Countifollowed Mariou into the house, and with little&#xD;
 noise they ascended to his room. There was a cheerful fire in&#xD;
the grate. Candles were on the table ready to be lighted, and.&#xD;
in addition there was a light supper waiting for Marion.&#xD;
"Seat yourself, Count, and be at home."&#xD;
The Count drew a chair to the fire, gave a slight shiver, and'&#xD;
remarked, as though he had just found it out, "It is quite cool&#xD;
to-night."&#xD;
"cDecidedly," said Marion, who had got off his overcoat, and&#xD;
had taken a seat in a cozy cushioned rocking-chair. "Now,&#xD;
Count, I want you to deal frankly with me. I am of the opin.-&#xD;
ion that you have no room to go to to-night."&#xD;
"You are perfectly correct. Such is the fact."&#xD;
"Excuse me, Count, I do not wish to pry into your affairs;&#xD;
but when a gentlemanly person like yourself makes such an&#xD;
admission, it is high time that some friend should find out what&#xD;
it means."&#xD;
"You are right. You noticed that I ate very heartily to-&#xD;
night at the supper ?"&#xD;
"I did-and wQndered at it.-&#xD;
"This night food passed my lips for the first time in three&#xD;
days."&#xD;
"Count, Count, this is too bad !" and Marion looked at the&#xD;
supper. The Count understood it.&#xD;
No, no. I have ate enough for three days more."&#xD;
"How is it that I find you in such company, and without a&#xD;
home to go to ?"&#xD;
"Simply this, that I have kept up appearances to the last.&#xD;
Col. Mae Neil knew me under other circumstances. He knows&#xD;
tlpat I can handle cards better than he can. He knows that I&#xD;
am too poor to play. He invited me to-night, with the under..&#xD;
standing that if he was beat by any of his rich opponents, I was&#xD;
to take his place, he was to furnish me with means, and my&#xD;
share of the plunder would have been whatever he chose to&#xD;
give me. He was lucky all the evening, and my services were,&#xD;
not needed. I was too proud to even tell the person whose&#xD;
supper I had eaten, that I had not a cent, or a place to lay my&#xD;
head to-night. Had I done so, I dare say he would have&#xD;
handed me a five, as he would have- done to a beggar, but&#xD;
would never have met me as an equal again."&#xD;
"Count, do you know that you cannot get out of this room&#xD;
to-night ?"&#xD;
The Count insisted that he would go-that he was sure that&#xD;
he should be a trouble, and made a thougnd apologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"I would cheerfully let you have money to-night, Count,&#xD;
but no hotel is open, and I really have business for you to do&#xD;
in (ge morning."&#xD;
" Business for me !" the Count repeated, as though anything&#xD;
for him to do was an utter, and very absurd idea., He had lost&#xD;
all hope.&#xD;
"Yes. Business-occupation.   Something that will em-&#xD;
ploy your time, and that will give you an income that will sup-&#xD;
port you like a gentleman, as I believe you are. Yonder is a&#xD;
large double bed-you have got to occupy one side, I the&#xD;
other."&#xD;
The Count would not-he would sit by the fire, But no.--&#xD;
Marion would not consent to anything but that the Count should&#xD;
immediately undress and go to bed. The Count was in de-&#xD;
spair. He would not undress-he would lie down upon the&#xD;
carpet, but he would not trespass so much upon the kindness&#xD;
of Mr. Monck. Marion became really angry, and the Count&#xD;
saw that it was so. He rose from his seat, and with quiet dig-&#xD;
nity, said,&#xD;
"Be it so. But you might have spared -me from showing&#xD;
my disgrace." As he said this he slowly unbuttoned his coat&#xD;
and removed it from his body, and burst into tears.&#xD;
So did Marion. "1My poor Count, is it possible !"&#xD;
The Count was vestless and shirtless. Not a rag covered&#xD;
him but that old military coat and the close-fitting military&#xD;
stock. He quietly tok off the pair of white pantaloons and&#xD;
his boots. He had not even a pair of stockings.&#xD;
"Do not be, angry ith me, Mr. Monck. This is not my&#xD;
seeking.-you made me do it ;" and as Marion continued silent,&#xD;
he added, " I ought not to have come here-,.and then I should&#xD;
not have been exposed."&#xD;
"Exposed !" repeated Marion. "Why, Count, you don't&#xD;
know me., Thank God, you are not far from my size. Now&#xD;
Count, I want you to oblige me ;" and heopened a bureau, and&#xD;
took from it two pair of thick woolen under shirts. "Put&#xD;
them on, Count."  Two pair of woolen drawers. "Put them&#xD;
on." A pair of thick socks, and last a fine linen shirt wer&#xD;
laid across the chair. "All must go on."&#xD;
The Count consented.&#xD;
" Now these pantaloons...-this vest, Count.. Last,.not least,&#xD;
this coat. Here is a new stock. Now Couiit, don't stop yet-..&#xD;
I am master here. Put on this cloak-I never wear it. Now&#xD;
Count, you can take all' these things off, and go to bed'as soon&#xD;
as you please, but all have toe go on in the morning ; and to&#xD;

relieve your mind of all obligation, let me say this.-that be-&#xD;

Then, if you choose, you can pay me."&#xD;
The Count was leaning his- head on a, char, crying. -*e&#xD;
could bear up with the thermometer 'at twenty degrees below&#xD;
zero, but the kindness of a heart that beat at ninety in -the&#xD;
shade melted him. He was like a child. "Don't laugh at'&#xD;
me, Count," continued Marion, who delicately wished to spare&#xD;
!j11A  the Count's feelings, "but I have done you -the most gross in-&#xD;
justice; and I beg your pardon a million of times."&#xD;
"You, Mr. Monck? Why, in what manner&#xD;

cold January night because you had no other ?'&#xD;
Certainly,: but they were respectable, and no one would&#xD;
notice them at a party."&#xD;
"Why, Count, I think a hundred thousand times more. of&#xD;
you than I did before I knew all this. I did you gross injus-&#xD;
tice about those pants. I never for a moment dreamed of the&#xD;
real state of the case.' I supposed you were a stuck-up for-&#xD;
eigner, that wanted to come some new dodge over us unsophis-&#xD;
ticated Yankees, and out-do us; and that you had put on those&#xD;
white pants to astonish th3 crowd. You did astonish me.&#xD;
Some day, Count, you will tell me how all this has come about.&#xD;
Not to-night. Now let's to bed, and get' a good though short&#xD;
night's sleep, for it is after three o'clock."&#xD;
Both slept better than usual-the one with the sweet con-&#xD;
sciousness that he had performed a good action; the other,&#xD;
that he had found a true friend and some comfort in his dreary&#xD;
walk. What passed in the morning in that room must be left&#xD;
to another chapter.&#xD;

Tn sun was pouring his most brilliant beams into the room&#xD;
of Marion Monck when he awoke the morning after the supper&#xD;
at the City Hotel. He heard breathing near him, and as he&#xD;
turned his eyes to the spot from whence the curious noise pro-&#xD;
ceeded, he saw the.pale face of the Count. He was buried in&#xD;
deep sleep. Marion then recalled all the circumstances of the&#xD;
past night. He immediately arose, dressed himself without&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.73&#xD;
&#xD;
making any noise,' and descended to the breakfast room.&#xD;
There he found Mrs. -Nordheim, who received him very cor-&#xD;
dially; and then enquired, " Who in. the world, Marion, did you&#xD;
bring home with you last night?  You were out very late."&#xD;
Marion took her hand and commenced an apology.  She inter-&#xD;
rupted him. "Stop all that. I do not need any explanation. I&#xD;
have the most unbounded confidence in you, Marion, and am&#xD;
perfectly satisfied that when you do any thing out of the, usual&#xD;
course of things, it is capable of being properly explained."&#xD;
"But I must tell you the whole story."&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheim listened with the most profound attention&#xD;
until Marion came to the part where he had to tell of the&#xD;
Count's real destitution, and then she cried in sympathy.&#xD;
" Poor fellow! and to bear up so bravely, too! We must&#xD;
do some thing for him, What can be done ?"&#xD;
" Leave it to me, dear Bessy. I have a plan in my head,&#xD;
but have no time to detail itto you now."&#xD;
"Don't attempt it. Go up and- call the Count down to&#xD;
breakfast. I have a nice one all ready, and it needs but an&#xD;
extra plate, or he can take Mr. Nordheim's place. He did not&#xD;
come home last night, and I suppose he will breakfast down&#xD;
town to-day, or in-Broome street. Never mind."&#xD;
Half an hour later the Count was seated at the breakfast-'&#xD;
table. He was a fine-looking fellow, about Marion's size, and&#xD;
the clothes he had received made him look much better than&#xD;
he did the night previous in the white pants. His moustache&#xD;
and imperial were properly arranged, his hair carefully&#xD;
combed, and he was altogether a different person. His con-&#xD;
versation was amusing, and Bessy Nordheim     was much&#xD;
pleased with him. Breakfast was over.&#xD;
" Now, Count, I expect you to go down with me, and as I am&#xD;
late, I must hurry you."  Marion sent the girl up for his cloak&#xD;
as well as overcoat, and after the Count had flung the cloak&#xD;
over his person, they left for Broad street.&#xD;
Mr. Nordheim was already at the store, and alone in his&#xD;
private office. Marion entered, passed the usual compliments&#xD;
of the day, and, after closirig the door, asked Mr. Nordheim if&#xD;
he could have t few moments' private conversation with him.&#xD;
" Unquestionably, Marion. Is there any thing the matter at&#xD;
the house ?" said he, somewhat startled.&#xD;
"Nothing, except that I took a guest there last night, en-&#xD;
tirely. unauthorized."&#xD;
,*" Is that all ?" and Mr. Nordheim looked listlessly out of the&#xD;
window. Marion continued, and did not a§top until he "had&#xD;

given in detail all that could operate favorably for the Count,&#xD;
adding, "You know, sir, Miss Clara has been very anxious for&#xD;
a person to teach her languages. I think this is the very man,&#xD;
-iff-it meets your approval."&#xD;
Mr. Nordheim was wide awake.   "You have said nothing&#xD;
to the person about Miss Norris ?"&#xD;
"Not a word."&#xD;
"Nor to her about the Count ?"&#xD;
"How could I?   I have not seen her."&#xD;
"True, true. Where is the person ?"&#xD;
"'Seated in the front office."&#xD;
"1Stay where you are. I will go and have a look at him."&#xD;
Marion remained. Mr. Nordheim was absent but an instant,&#xD;
and then he returned and resumed his seat, and reflected a&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
"What do you propose to do in the matter, Marion?  He&#xD;
seems a very nice person., Is he capable, think you?"&#xD;
"I have no doubt about that, and I think that he is in such&#xD;
need that he will be very faithful to you, sir, if you pay him&#xD;
pretty liberally for his services."&#xD;
"Indeed. You may be right. Suppose you engage him,&#xD;
then. Hire him for the office."&#xD;
"For the office ?" repeated Marion, in surprise.&#xD;
"Yes, sir. Engage his services at fifty dollars a month, to&#xD;
copy, translate, or do any work required about the counting-&#xD;
room, and make one of the conditions that he shall teach Miss&#xD;
Norris any language that she wishes to learn. I suppose he&#xD;
can support himself very well on six hundred dollars a year,&#xD;
and I will have it charged to my private account,  Ii. will&#xD;
speak to Mr. Granville about the matter, and you can tell Mr.&#xD;
Wilson to give him a deskand find something for him to, do.&#xD;
Draw a check for fifty dollars, and give him in advance, and&#xD;
take his receipt. When this is done, youhad better take him&#xD;
up to Miss Norris. No. Go up yourself, and see what she&#xD;
thinks of it, and if she agrees, the Count can go to give her&#xD;
the first lesson to-morrow."&#xD;
Mr. Nordheim was a prudent man; if he paid for teaching&#xD;
he meant to make the most of the teacher.&#xD;
"When you get things fixed, Marion, you can let me know."&#xD;
What tfe junior partner said to the senior, rests with them.&#xD;
MArion informed Mr. Wilson that the Count Falsechinski was&#xD;
to be a clerk from that date, and then introduced them to each&#xD;
other, first telling Mr. Wilson all about the Count, and after&#xD;
he had asked the Count if six hundred dollars a year would&#xD;

Ii&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
keep him afloat, the Count could not contain his joy. Re was&#xD;
almost annoying in his expressions of gratitude. "Keep calm&#xD;
Count, and wait here until I return."&#xD;
Marion went at once to the residence of Miss Norris, in.&#xD;
formed her of his success, atid told her that now she could&#xD;
learn ten languages, if it pleased her to do so. He informed&#xD;
her of all that had passed.  "Poor fellow, I know I shall&#xD;
like him, and you may tell Mr. Nordheim that I thank him&#xD;
very much. When will he come up ?"&#xD;
"1To-morrow."&#xD;
"iOh, no. Send him up this afternoon."&#xD;
Marion returned to the office, where he found the Count al-&#xD;
ready at work translating some invoices.&#xD;
"Count,I have some other work for you to do. The junior&#xD;
partner, Mr. Nordheim, has a relative that he wishes'. to be&#xD;
taught French and other languages, if she wishes it. You will&#xD;
go there this afternoon. I will give you a note, and you can&#xD;
commence yourinstructions immediatelyy"&#xD;
I" 1 like that very much, indeed."&#xD;
"You will devote all the time necessary to the young lady,&#xD;
and purchase such books as she may need. You will get the&#xD;
moneyfrom me. Here is a receipt for you to sign for your&#xD;
first month's wages, and here is fifty dollars; and I also rel&#xD;
commend you to get a boarding-house without any delay."&#xD;
The Count promised to do ary and every thing.  Marion&#xD;
gave him a letter to the lady at No. 591 Broome street, and he&#xD;
delivered it that day, and then returned to the office.  Mr.&#xD;
Wilson did not like the new arrangement.  He was intensely&#xD;
-   English, and hated foreigners, particularly if they had mous-&#xD;
taches.&#xD;
"4I will make that fellow do more work than he ever did be".&#xD;
fore, but I am sorry he is coming into the office. I don't mind&#xD;
his teaching the young woman, although that is very bad, .in a&#xD;
financial point of view."&#xD;
The Count selected a boarding-place in John street before&#xD;
night, and gave Marion a very pressing, invitation to come and&#xD;
see him.  The latter promised to do so the. very first oppor-&#xD;
tunity.&#xD;
"Mr. Monck, I have no words that cair express my gratitude&#xD;
to you.  Last night I was almost in despair.  I meditated&#xD;
suicide. I met you-I found rest--clothes-food-an income&#xD;
  and a home, and a bright prospect of independence.  What&#xD;
oan Ido for you ?  What canlIsay ?"&#xD;
" Say nothing at all, Count. Go to work with a good. wili&#xD;

Teach that young lady all that you know in languages. Be&#xD;

"1I know that already, Mr. Monck, and rest assured I will&#xD;
tpach as no teacher ever taught pupil before, and I will do all&#xD;
that can be found for me to do at the office.  God bless you,&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
Tom Grqnville's Extravagance-Washington Hall, aird an evening&#xD;
at a Faro Bank.&#xD;
AGREEABLY to the engagement made between old Mrs. Chase&#xD;
and Mr. Pitt Granville, Thomas became a partner of the firm&#xD;
a month after his marriage.  Mr. Nordheim agreed to it, on&#xD;
one condition, that his share of the profits was to continue the&#xD;
same, viz: one half. It was a generous act on Mr. Granville's&#xD;
part, to relinquish his own half share or any portion of it to&#xD;
his brother, but he did so--to what extent was only known to&#xD;
the brothers.  The style of the firm  remained unchanged.&#xD;
We have already stated that Mr. Granville had rented a house&#xD;
and furnished it previous to the marriage of his brother.  To&#xD;
this house. which was located in Chanibers street, the new&#xD;
married couple removed on their return from Baltimore. The&#xD;
house was crowded with visitors, for Tom invited every body&#xD;
that he had ever known, to come and see ,im, and he gave a&#xD;
dinner.party every day of the week, and before March had&#xD;
given two large parties at night, and the doings got into the&#xD;
newspapers. Mrs. Thomas Granville became the talk of the&#xD;
town. Tom himself attended to business for about a month,&#xD;
and then he 'neglected to come t the office until one or two&#xD;
o'clock in the afternoon.  His brother renionstrated, and&#xD;
plainly told him that such neglect would be ruinous ; and Tom,&#xD;
to show how he appreciated such brotherly 'advice, did not&#xD;
come down at all, except it was to draw money.  Luckily for&#xD;
the house of.Granville &amp;amp; Nordheim, the partnership, so far as&#xD;
Tom was concerned, was a matter between him and his&#xD;
brother. No notice was publicly made, nor was it intended to&#xD;
be until 'the grandmother of Mr. Tom  Granville paid the&#xD;
twenty-five thousand dollars. The way that Tom was going&#xD;
on--spending money at the rate of ten thousand dollars a&#xD;

year--made it pretty certain that the old lady would back out&#xD;
of her promise, for it was not probable that Tom's extrava-&#xD;
gance could long be kept from her. Still 'the Senior Gran-&#xD;
ville determined to keep his brother within, bounds, and&#xD;
agreed to allow him at the rate of two hundred dollars a&#xD;
month, and no more. January and February passed, and Ton&#xD;
rather increased than diminished his expenses, for he told&#xD;
Mr. Granville on the first of March, only two months after his&#xD;
marriage, that he required a thousand dollars to pay off what&#xD;
he already owed, and that if W. Pitt Granville would let&#xD;
him have that amount, he would solemnly promise after that&#xD;
to live within two hundred dollars a month. Poor Torn. The&#xD;
Elder Granville gave him the one thousand dollars, but Tom&#xD;
was incurable. He flung away the money by the handful, and&#xD;
did not use the one thousand dollars to pay old claims, but&#xD;
spent it in new extravagancies.&#xD;
About a month after the one thousand dollars had' been ad-&#xD;
vanced by one brother, and slandered by the other, Tom&#xD;
called at the counting room to make a fresh demand. It was&#xD;
evening. The next was packet day,'and this was called packet&#xD;
night. In these days of steamers, the word may not be under-&#xD;
stood by the reader. In the days of sailing packets, nearly all.&#xD;
the foreign merchants kept their offices open the night before&#xD;
a packet sailed for Liverpool, London or Havre, those be-&#xD;
jug the ports to which regular foreign packet lines were&#xD;
established.  When - Thomas  Granville  reached  the  of-&#xD;
fice, he found his brother had left, and was not. expected&#xD;
to return. Mr. Nordheim was -in the private office,&#xD;
and as soon as he }ecame aware that young Granville was&#xD;
there, he came out, and invited him to go in the private room.&#xD;
Tom accepted.  When they were alone, Mr. Nordheim kindly&#xD;
inquired after his handsome lady,.adding-&#xD;
"I think you are a very lucky man, Mr. Granville, in secur-&#xD;
ing as-a life partner so charming a person."&#xD;
Ton said he was satisfied with his choice.&#xD;
"I understand, Mr. Granville, that my partner has given&#xD;
you an interest in his partnership, and I was given to undei-&#xD;
stand that you would take an active part in the management&#xD;
of our business.&#xD;
Tom replied:&#xD;
"I believe something of the kind was talked about, but I&#xD;
don't like business.  I think it. a most infernal bore.  My&#xD;
brother thinks I ought to be down here at ten ~o'clock, but I&#xD;
find it utterly out of the question. I never get up until&#xD;

&#xD;
twelve, and it takes an hour before I get my breakfast down,&#xD;
consequently it is after two o'clock before I could possibly&#xD;
get to the office. My brother found fault, and I gave up com-&#xD;
ing at all."&#xD;
"IYou do not appear to be as fond of commercial business as&#xD;
my partner. He is always at his post before nine o'clock."&#xD;
"He is, excuse me, a great fool for his pains., No, I don't&#xD;
'think business agrees with me, and I shall cut it.".&#xD;
"You married a lady of some wealth, I believe."&#xD;
"Not a red cent, as yet. She has an old witch of a grand-&#xD;
mother who is a4 rich as black mud. She is ninety-five, and&#xD;
ought to have died long ago, but really she is so dried up and&#xD;
withered, that I think she may outlive me. When she dies,&#xD;
if the old fool will ever oblige her grandchildren so much as&#xD;
to die, she will cut up well, and my wife will get her slice."&#xD;
"Meanwhile, Mr. Granville, how are you to live?  I sup-&#xD;
pose my worthy partner allows you a pretty liberal sum,&#xD;
eh ?"&#xD;
"So, so, but I am spending more, much more than my' allow-&#xD;
ance .of two thousand four hundred dollars, and I came here&#xD;
to-night on a beg--disagrpeable, is it not ?"&#xD;
"Very, Mr. Granville. People say you are one of the most&#xD;
fascinating dogs alive. Is that so&#xD;
"I am overrated, I fear. I never tried to be very fascinat-&#xD;
ing."'&#xD;
"Now, Mr. Granville, if you were so disposed, you could&#xD;
do me a great favor. I want to get rid of a woman, and if&#xD;
you would exeit your fascinations in my favor, with a very&#xD;
beautiful creature,.and take her off my hands-.get me clear&#xD;
of her, I 'will not only be very grateful, bnt I will, as my&#xD;
worthy man Wilson says, make it an object to you in a financial&#xD;
point of view."&#xD;
"Nothing will give me greater pleasure. Your wife, I sup-&#xD;
pose ?"&#xD;
'I-- it, no, man, not so bad as that comes to.  No.  It is&#xD;
a  -eybeautiful, but terrifically expensive mistress - that T&#xD;
have. In a word, I am tired df her. I want to get her off my&#xD;
hands, and yet I will not cut the connexion myself, but if you&#xD;
can gain her affection--get her to leave me, -and run off with,&#xD;
you in such a way that she caq, have no possible claim upon&#xD;
me, I will give you, as soon as the work is finished, two thoU-&#xD;
sand dollars.  More than that.  If you consent to do what I&#xD;
require, I will give you to-night five hundred dollars to comn-&#xD;
menee the war with."&#xD;
&#xD;
I1,&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.                     - '9&#xD;
I will do it, as sure as my name is Thomas Granville."&#xD;
"You will have hard work.  She' has an easy time of it&#xD;
and every comfort and luxury, and-aind- think she really&#xD;
loves me ;" and Mr. Nordheim stroked his whiskers with great&#xD;
satisfaction.&#xD;
"How am I to get acquainted with her ladyship?"&#xD;
"She has a Count Falsechinski, who is a clerk in this office,&#xD;
and who is also employed in teaching her French.  You must&#xD;
get him to take you"'there, or Marion Monck.  Do it any way&#xD;
you can, except through me.  She is very honorable.  Were&#xD;
I to introduce you, and you were to make love demonstrations,&#xD;
she would feel called upon to inform me.  That will not do.&#xD;
Is it a bargain ? Will you undertake it ?"&#xD;
"With the greatest pleasure; but I must have some money&#xD;
immediately. I shall succeed. Have no fear of that. Three&#xD;
months from this I will claim the other fifteen hundred dol-&#xD;
lars--..perhaps sooner."&#xD;
"1I have not five hundred dollars with me; but I will draw&#xD;
a check for the amount, and, go with you to the City Hotel, and&#xD;
Jennings will cash it to-night. He has frequently accommo-&#xD;
dated me in that manner after bank hours.&#xD;
The check was drawn and signed, and then these two. con-'&#xD;
spirators left the office in company for the City Hotel. Jen-&#xD;
niings cashed the cheek. "I am walking up Broadway, and&#xD;
will keep you company', Granville, if you have no objection."&#xD;
Torn agreed, and on they passed until they came to Chambers&#xD;
street, when Tom invited h is companion to go home with him.&#xD;
This was.what Mr. Nordheim anxiously desii'ed, and they&#xD;
walked down Chambers street to Tom's residence. -When they&#xD;
entered the parlor Mrs. Gr;irnville was alone. She bowed to&#xD;
Mr. Nordheim, and then, in a very anxious manner, asked,&#xD;
" Well, did you see your brother ? and with what success '&#xD;
Tom'placed a roll in her hand, and replied, "No, Pitt was&#xD;
out, but Mr. Nordhein advanced me what I needed, and you&#xD;
can thank him for relieving our pressing necessities."&#xD;
Kate Granville wa-s somewhat surprised, and she thanked&#xD;
Mr. Nordheim, although somewhat coldly, for she had met&#xD;
him on several occasions, and there was something in his&#xD;
manner that'did not please a virtuous wife. She was afraid&#xD;
of him. and almost wished that Tom could have procured the&#xD;
money somewhere else. But the money must be had, and she&#xD;
took it and used it.&#xD;
Tom made no stay at home. .Other guests came in, and he&#xD;
left, apologizing to Mr. Nordheim, and saying he would return&#xD;

soon. He called Kate out into the hall. As soon as they were&#xD;
alone, she said,,&#xD;
"No, no, Tom. I know what you want, but I need every&#xD;
cent to pay what we must pay, or be turned out of house and&#xD;
home, and be disgraced."&#xD;
" Only a hundred, Kate. I must have it. Why, woman, it&#xD;
is mine. I earned it-yes, earned it'&#xD;
"Tom, you will lose it at gambling. I know you will; you&#xD;
have no luck, and-but here, take it and go; I must get back&#xD;
into  the parlor.".&#xD;
Tom got into the street, and with a hundred dollars in his&#xD;
pocket. He'turned around into Warren street, and into No. 9.&#xD;
" Blinn, give me a glass of' brandy and water.. Has the&#xD;
Count Falsechinski been here yet ?"&#xD;
"No, Monsieur Granville. The Count has not been here&#xD;
yet."&#xD;
While Tom was sipping his brandy the 'Count entered: " Ah,&#xD;
Count, I am glad to meet you. What in the name of Lucifer&#xD;
has come over you? Have you discovered a gold mine, a new&#xD;
tailor, or what is out ?" asked Tom Granville.&#xD;
The Count smiled, and took a seat. In a moment, an idea&#xD;
seemed to flash across Tom's mind, for he-,asked, "Have you&#xD;
got employment to teach French to a young lady..a Miss Clara&#xD;
Norris-eh ."&#xD;
"And suppose I have, Mr. Tom  Granville, have you any&#xD;
objection to my making an honest living!"&#xD;
"None in the world, Count, for I like you very much. I&#xD;
knew that this coffee-house is one of your haunts, and that&#xD;
you came here every evening. I had heard of a Count being&#xD;
employed in my brother's office and that he taught French to&#xD;
a very dear friend of my brother's partner, Mr Nordheim, but&#xD;
I did not know that you were that Count. You remember,&#xD;
your promise some weeks ago?'&#xD;
"Name it, Mr. Granville."&#xD;
-" You promised that for a smalsum fou would teach me,&#xD;
hbow toplaywith the chances in my favor against a Faro&#xD;
Ba-nk. .&#xD;
"Excuse me, Mr. Granville-.-with the chances not in&#xD;
your favor. Ten weeks ago, when I made that promise, I was&#xD;
very poor. I needed money, and I was aware that you were&#xD;
losing money every night at a Faro Bank. I could have saved&#xD;
you from losing, but you did not avail yourself of my offer. I am&#xD;
in different circumstances to-night, and I might decline your&#xD;
offer, but I will not. But I must do one ting. I assist yout&#xD;
&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
to-night. I will dictate my terms. First answer me this&#xD;
question: how much money have you in your pocket to lose&#xD;
to-night? Precisely, tell me."&#xD;
"1That is a queer question, Count. But I will- answer it.&#xD;
One hundred dollars : no more, or no less."&#xD;
"Now   I will tell you    what I will do. Give     me&#xD;
that money in my" own hand. You can come with me&#xD;
to Washington Hall..to the Faro Bank room. I will play for&#xD;
you, with your money. If I lose it, you are not to say a word.&#xD;
If I win, you will follow me out, and I will pay you One-half of&#xD;
the winnings.&#xD;
"9But, Count, that is rather severe. I put up. the money,&#xD;
lose it, if it is lost, and if it wins only get one.half. Oh, no."&#xD;
"Very well. , Then I will not play for you. I put up my&#xD;
experiences against you with your money. It is worth more&#xD;
than your money if I win, as you know. Say no more. Those&#xD;
are my terms."&#xD;
. "There, Count, try it. Here, take the hundred dollars; but&#xD;
I will go with you, and if I say stop, or"-&#xD;
"If you say one word to me, I will knock you down."&#xD;
"Why, Count, what is the matter with you ?"&#xD;
"Nothing at all. Remember, not a word to me, for I will&#xD;
not only strike you, but I will deny that I have received a&#xD;
cent from you and call you a liar; and, Mr. Tom Granville,&#xD;
the word of the Count Adolph Falsechinski with money in&#xD;
his pocket, will outweigh the oaths- of Mr. Tom Granville,&#xD;
penniless as you are now. Trust me as a gentleman, and half&#xD;
the winnings are yours. If we miss each other when we leave&#xD;
the gambling table, I will come directly here. Do you fol-&#xD;
low."&#xD;
The Count had the hundred dollars, and the conditions&#xD;
were arranged. Then ,the Count ordered a strong cup of&#xD;
coffee, and the pair left the French coffee-house for Washing-&#xD;
ton Hall, then the headquarters of fashionable young New&#xD;
York   John Mariner kept it then. It has long ago been torn&#xD;
down and its site occupied by Stewart's great dry-goods store.&#xD;
The Count and Tom went into the bar-room. Several of their&#xD;
acquaintances were there, and they all took a drink at the&#xD;
Count's expense. As Tom Granville.kept near the Count, the&#xD;
latter whispered, "Don't come near me, or speak to me again,&#xD;
until we meet at the French coffee-house. Don't go ta the&#xD;
Faro table with me. - Keep by youself."&#xD;
The. Count shortly afterward separated from the party who&#xD;
had drank at his expense, and quietly slipped into the great&#xD;

hall, and then passed to the third floor, and on the right hand&#xD;
side, knocked at a green baize door. A question was asked by&#xD;
some one inside. The Count replied, and his answer appeared&#xD;
to be satisfactory, for the door was opened just sufficiently&#xD;
wide to admit him. When he had entered, the door was closed&#xD;
and fastened.. There were two large rooms, separated only by&#xD;
large folding doors.  In one of the rooms were several tables,&#xD;
and surrounding them were parties of two or more engaged in&#xD;
card-playing.  In the other room was a long table.  To this&#xD;
the Count approached., Twenty more persons were seated&#xD;
about it. One man, to whom the Count bowed, was dealing&#xD;
from a small silver box.  On the table before the dealer, cov-*&#xD;
ering nearly the whole table, was a suit of cards, commencing&#xD;
with the ace and ending with the king.  By the side of the&#xD;
dealer was a man who acted as banker or treasurer.  He had&#xD;
a box filled with piles of white, red and purple chips. Each&#xD;
white chip was worth one dollar. The reds were fives, and&#xD;
the purples twenty dollars each.- Another person sat close by&#xD;
the cashier, with a little box filled with white and black checks&#xD;
on wires. As a card was dealt, he mofed a corresponding&#xD;
check in the'little box. This was the man who kept the game.&#xD;
The play was running high, piles of red chips were upon the&#xD;
cards, and the luck seemed to favor the bank, for the dealer&#xD;
raked pile after pile of the red chips towards him, and then&#xD;
deliberately restacked them in the mahogany box. Presently&#xD;
Mr. Granville entered. The Count was still standing up. He&#xD;
did not notice hinl. The play went one.  One-and then ano-&#xD;
ther, left the room-had lost all. Their faces were haggard&#xD;
and despairing. The Count smiled., He was not ready to&#xD;
play yet. ' He was noticing one man, behind whose seat he&#xD;
stood. He seemed scarcely conscious of any thing. He placed&#xD;
a pile of red chips upon the ace'; the cards were dealt. He&#xD;
had lost. He rose from his seat, and with horrid curses and&#xD;
imprecations upon himself, cards, and every thing else, left&#xD;
the room. The Count took the seat left vacant by this person,&#xD;
who had lost fifteen hundred dollars in half an hour-..&#xD;
" Hand me a hundred dollars' worth of red chips, if you&#xD;
please," said the Count-and as they were delivered to him he&#xD;
deliberately counted twenty, and piled them up before him. A&#xD;
new' deal commenced. The Count placed a red chip on the ace&#xD;
-another on the seven-spot. It was some time before either&#xD;
turned up. He was a winner. Meanwhile the Count had&#xD;
watched other cards ; the king had been dealt out three times&#xD;
and the deuce-spot twice. He placed ten red chips on the&#xD;
&#xD;

king and five on the deuce. The king won.  He had doubled&#xD;
ten red chips. The deuce won. The Count then placed twen-&#xD;
ty red chips upon the last deuce ; it was a bet, and won.  He&#xD;
looked at the game board-there was but one five spot in. All&#xD;
the -rest had won for the bank.  The Count placed fifty red&#xD;
chips upon it, and won. That deal was over, and the Count&#xD;
piled up his winnings, but was perfectly cool.  There was no&#xD;
limit to the betting allowed at that faro bank. If it bet fifty&#xD;
thousand dollars, it would be good.&#xD;
Another deal began. The Count scattered one or two chips&#xD;
on different cards-.-and they won and lost, until be noticed that&#xD;
but two aces-one seven and one ten-were left in the dealer's&#xD;
box.  He put down' five piles each of twenty red chips on the&#xD;
ace, and won. He was paid in purple chips.  He left all the&#xD;
purple chips on the ace again, and it won. There was but one&#xD;
turn more, and the Count placed five hundred dollars on it. It&#xD;
won. Another deal followed, and the Count played heavier&#xD;
yet. When there was but one ace left in the box, he placed&#xD;
fifteen hundred, dollars upon it.&#xD;
"That is my last play to-night," said the Count sternly.&#xD;
The cards were dealt.&#xD;
" He has won," said Samuel-and so he had.&#xD;
"Pay me," said the Count, and he received from the. smil-&#xD;
ing banker four thousand two hundred dollars, and it was paid&#xD;
as pleasantly as though he would not have cared if it had been&#xD;
four hundred and twenty thousand dollars.&#xD;
The Count placed the money about his person, waited a few&#xD;
moments, looked at those who continued-to play, and then left&#xD;
the room and descended to the bar-room.  Several gentlemen&#xD;
who were broke followed him, and begged a small loan.&#xD;
" No, it is not my money," said the Count.&#xD;
In the bar-room he asked several up to drink. Then Gran-&#xD;
ville came up, expecting of course to be invited.&#xD;
"If you drink, let it be at your own expense, Mr. Gran-&#xD;
vule " quietly observed the ,ount.&#xD;
f Tom took the hint and sheered off.  After the drinks had&#xD;
been settled for, the Count walked slowly to the French cof-&#xD;
fee house in Warren street.  As he entered, he- saw Tom&#xD;
Granville with a glass of brandy before him. The Count took&#xD;
a seat opposite to him.&#xD;
" You are lucky to-night, Count," remarked Tom Gran-&#xD;
ville.&#xD;
" I played my own game, sir," replied the Conut.&#xD;
" You must have won a couple of thousand dollars."&#xD;

Tom had got so excited before the last deal that he had de&#xD;
scended to the bar-room to get cool, and was not present when&#xD;
the Count placed fifteen hundred dollars on one card.&#xD;
The Count placed roll after roll of money on the table.&#xD;
"Hands off!" he exclaimed, as Tom put out a hand to clutch&#xD;
some.&#xD;
The Count, then counted it, for there were threo bills of&#xD;
one thousand dollars each.&#xD;
"1Four thousand two hundred," said the Coppt.&#xD;
Tom-Granville ordered another glass of brandy.&#xD;
" Four thousand two hundred," repeated the Count-" and&#xD;
your share is twenty-one hundred dollars," and he handed him&#xD;
the precise amount.&#xD;
*  Waiter, bring me a cup of coffee and a cigar."  He lit the&#xD;
latter, and turning his face to Torn, quietly asked, " What was-&#xD;
your meaning to-night, when you asked if I was the Count who&#xD;
was teaching French to Miss Norris ?"&#xD;
"Oh, nothing in particular. Count, how can I express my&#xD;
gratitude for this sum of money ?"&#xD;
"By saying no more about it. It is but a trifle, Tom&#xD;
Granville."&#xD;
"I suppose you will now play on your own hook and win&#xD;
a good deal more.'"&#xD;
"1fYou never was more mistaken in your life.  I never play&#xD;
at faro when I have plenty of money.  I only play with my&#xD;
last dollar, or when I have other people's money to lose or win&#xD;
with. What do you want to know about Miss Norris ?"&#xD;
acuI hear she is very pretty. I should like amazingly to get&#xD;
acquainted with her."&#xD;
The Count laid down his cigar,. and gazed into the face of&#xD;
Tornfor a minute ereherreplied,&#xD;
I will take you there."&#xD;
"When-?" asked Tom.&#xD;
] ow-to-night. It is not late, and as you are a good mu-&#xD;
sician,, we will have- music, and u gay time of it."&#xD;
At twelve thatnight, if Mr. Nordheim had called upon Miss&#xD;
Norris, ihe would have bad the pleasure of listening to a deli-&#xD;
cious concert  Clara played the piano, the Count accompanied&#xD;
her with the guitar, and Tom Granville, who would have made&#xD;
money as a tenor singer in opera, sang some of the sweetest&#xD;
songs in the English language; and in some few both the Count-&#xD;
and Clara joined.&#xD;

employed it-; and added, "My share was twenty-one hundred&#xD;
dollars, and Mr. Granville has an equal amount in his pocket.&#xD;
I think, Miss Clara, you ought to teach him how to spend it."&#xD;
What was the object of the Count?&#xD;
Miss Norris regarded Tom as a flat, and. she determined to&#xD;
take the Count's advice. She led Tom on so far as to promise&#xD;
that he would take a private box and accompany her to the&#xD;
Park Theatre the next evening.&#xD;
The two gentlemen 'left the house together; and as they&#xD;
came down town, the Count told Tom that he had evidently&#xD;
made an impression upon Miss Norris, and advised him to fol-&#xD;
low it up. What was the Count driving at?&#xD;
The Count saw Tom safe at his own house, and saw him en-&#xD;
ter; then he walked down to his own rooms in John street,&#xD;
and enjoyed a good night's repose.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
Prime, Ward &amp;amp; King-Teaching French-The Thousand Dollar Bill-&#xD;
The Park Theatre.&#xD;
THE morning following the successful gambling operation of&#xD;
the Count at Washington Hall was a delicious April .morning.&#xD;
Eight o'clock found the Count Falsechinski at the counting-&#xD;
house of his employers. 'Mr. Wilson had already arrived and&#xD;
opened the safe. The Count volunteered to assist him in&#xD;
transferring the massive ledger and journal and other books of&#xD;
a great commercial firm to the long mahogany desk occupied&#xD;
by the book-keeper. When the work was .done, Mr. Wilson&#xD;
thanked the Count, who asked, "What shall I commence do-&#xD;
ing ?" The Count wrote a hand that was almost like copy&#xD;
right. Wilson had become aware of the fact.&#xD;
I .f you have no particular objection, Count, I will get you&#xD;
to assist me in the books. You can copy my day entries into&#xD;
the journal."&#xD;
Mr. Xilson showed him how it was to be done, and the&#xD;
Count cheerfully weni to work. The stock of the Count ad-&#xD;
vanced fift per cent. that morning in Wilson's mind. After&#xD;
Iasomelittle time had elapsed while working, the Count asked&#xD;
Mr. Wilson to name to him the most responsible private bank-'&#xD;

where it would be drawing interest," and the Count laid down&#xD;
on the desk two thousand dollars. He took out one hundred&#xD;
dollars. "This I will keep. The two thousand dollars I wish&#xD;
to keep at the bankers."t&#xD;
Prime, Ward &amp;amp; King, No. 42 Wall street, are the firmest&#xD;
bankers. I would recommend them, but I am not certain&#xD;
that they will take your account.' Who could you get to go and&#xD;
introduce you to them ?"  -&#xD;
I know of no one," replied the Count.&#xD;
"Then, Count, I will tell you what I will do. Their book.&#xD;
keeper, Charles Christmas, is a particular friend of mine, and&#xD;
I flatter myself that my introduction to him will be as good an&#xD;
opening as you -could have. I will vouch for you, Count.&#xD;
About ten o'clock, if you will go with me to that banking&#xD;
house, I will do the needful, and get an account opened with&#xD;
you by that firm."&#xD;
When Marion arrived, he was somewhat surprised to see the&#xD;
Count and Mr. Wilson on such familiar terms, and he was&#xD;
rather pleased than otherwise.&#xD;
The bankers alluded to, Prime, Ward &amp;amp; King, were at that&#xD;
time regarded by the commercial community here, and, in fact,&#xD;
in every city of the Union, as the most solid house on this con-&#xD;
tinent. Their bills of exchange on London or Paris would&#xD;
bring one per cent. higher than any commercial firm.  The&#xD;
partners of this celebrated house were. men of originality. The&#xD;
senior was old " Nat Prime," as he was familiarly designated.&#xD;
He started life in a humble capacity, and rose to be the head&#xD;
of a great banking house, His residence for many years was&#xD;
at No. I Broadway, now occupied as a hotel.  " Sam Ward,"&#xD;
the second partner, built a house on the corner of Fourth&#xD;
street and Broadway, and added to it a gallery of paintings,&#xD;
that was the wonder of the people in that day.  James Gore&#xD;
King, the junior partner, was born in England, where his fath-&#xD;
er, Rufus King, was Ambassador from the United States to&#xD;
Great Britain. le was named after James Gore, a celebrated&#xD;
merchant. All these partners died long ago. The Count and&#xD;
Mr. Wilson went to the banking office of this firm. Wilson in-&#xD;
troduced'the Count to the book-keeper gith a request that he&#xD;
willingly complied with. In a word, -the Count was intro-&#xD;
duced to Mr. Ward, one of the partners, his account was re-&#xD;
ceived, and he deposited two thousand dollars, and wrote his&#xD;
signature upon the signature book. He also received a bank&#xD;
book, On the leather cover of which was printed Prime, Ward&#xD;
&amp;amp;King in account with, and written underneath, the Count'&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
Adolph Falsechinski, and inside he was credited April -fourth&#xD;
with two thousand dollars, bearing interest at four per cent,&#xD;
per annum. When this was all done, the Count. took- his&#xD;
leave, but not until he had made a very favorable impression&#xD;
upon Mr. Ward, who begged to serve him in any manner. The&#xD;
Count was a deep planner, and -knew the world. In opening&#xD;
an account with Prime, Ward &amp;amp; King, and getting one of their&#xD;
bank books with the naine of Count Adolph Falsechinski upon&#xD;
it, and a sum to his credit, he had procured a credit, a conse-&#xD;
quence, an endorsement, 'backers, position-that would be val-&#xD;
uable in any part of the Union. There was no disputing it.&#xD;
It was worth more than a reference, for either of the partners&#xD;
would have said they knew nothing of the Count. An author-&#xD;
ized banking book, with a credit of cash in with so respectable&#xD;
a firm, told its own story. It was the best kind of a reference.&#xD;
The Count had his opinion of it. "It was near twelve o'clock&#xD;
when all this was completed, and the Count, instead of return-&#xD;
ing to the counting house, parted- from Mr. Wilson, and went&#xD;
to Broome street to give a French lesson to Miss Norris.&#xD;
He found Tom Granville already there. Miss Norris re-&#xD;
ceived the lesson, which occupied nearly two hours? Tom .re-&#xD;
mained quiet until it was finished, and then insisted that Clara&#xD;
should read French with him an hour. Tom was a good French&#xD;
scholAr, for he had.in early life resided two years in France.&#xD;
"By-and-by. I will not now  I want to scold the Count for&#xD;
not coming earlier. I waited for you two hours this morning."&#xD;
".I am sorry for that, Miss Clara. I will be more punctual&#xD;
in future, but the fact is, I was obliged to visit my bankers,&#xD;
Prime, Ward &amp;amp; King, this morning,"-here he displayed care-&#xD;
lessly his bank book,--. and I was detained talking with' Mr.&#xD;
Ward longer than I expected."&#xD;
Tom opened his eyes, and even Miss Clara felt a greater re-&#xD;
spect for her teacher. Here was more mystery. A count, and&#xD;
a book account with Prime, Ward &amp;amp; King.&#xD;
"Count, Mr. Granville has secured a private box at the Park&#xD;
Theatre to-night. Shall we have the pleasure of your com-&#xD;
pany? You will be welcome."&#xD;
What is the novelty ?  What is to be played ?"&#xD;
"The Opera of La Somnambula. Mr. and Mrs. Wood and Mr.&#xD;
Brough, with his magnificent bass, all appear in it."&#xD;
",I shall accept your invitation with pleasure. I knew the&#xD;
Woods in London."&#xD;
" The deuce you did. .Tell us all about them, Count.. Is&#xD;
Mrs. Wood his wife ?"&#xD;

"To be sure she is, but she was divorced 'from her first&#xD;
husband, who was Lord Lennox.   Lady Lennox procured a&#xD;
divorce, and then married the tenor Wood. Lord.Lennox used&#xD;
to beat her,, it was said. I must go now, but will be here pre-.&#xD;
cisely at seven o'clock to. accompany'you to the theatre."&#xD;
" Mr. Granville," said the fascinating Clara, after the Count&#xD;
had gone, "how much have you left of the two thousand dollars&#xD;
you won last night ? They say you are a terrible fellow to&#xD;
spend money. I dare say you have spent it all."    . I&#xD;
"No, I have not. I have had no chance. See, here it is.&#xD;
Count it."&#xD;
Clara did as she was desired to do. She took a thousand&#xD;
dollar bill. "Tom, I will be your banker, and keep this for&#xD;
safety. You will squander it. It will do you no real good.&#xD;
With me it will be quite safe."&#xD;
Tom looked anxiously-.&#xD;
"What, afraid of me ! Here, take your old trash. What I&#xD;
proposed was for your own good, and you know it well," and&#xD;
the fair girl pouted as though she was angry in earnest.&#xD;
" My dear Miss Norris, you entirely mistook me. Keep it,&#xD;
by all means. -1 have the most perfect confidence in you. In-&#xD;
deed, I insist you shall be my banker."'&#xD;
In the struggle to force her to keep it, her face came near&#xD;
Tom's, and he kissed her.&#xD;
"You naughty man. That- is the first time I have been&#xD;
kissed, except by Mr. Nordheim, since I was a country girl.&#xD;
I do not see how you dared to do it. I will take good care of&#xD;
this money, if you wish . it, but really, I had rather you&#xD;
would take it back.'"&#xD;
But no, Toimi Granville would not consent to do any thing of&#xD;
the kind.&#xD;
" Very well, then, I will keep it safe, and you can have it&#xD;
whenever you wish. I should serve you perfectly right if I nev-&#xD;
er gave it back to you. It was very wrong for you to kiss me."&#xD;
What would Mr. Nordheim say, if he knew it ?  But to show&#xD;
you that I forgive you, I will read French with you an, hour,&#xD;
and then I must go, for I expect Mr. Nordheim, and he must&#xD;
not see you here.''&#xD;
Clara procured a book of French plays, and lay down on the&#xD;
lounge. Tom drew an ottoman near her head, and they, read&#xD;
together. Tom was completely. lost. That reading finished&#xD;
him. He was madly in love with Clara Norris. She sa it-.&#xD;
her pride was gratified, and she allowed him more kisses, and&#xD;
when he left he was perfectly insane about her, Wife, brother,&#xD;

business, all were forgotten. No sooner had he passed into&#xD;
the street than Clara took from her bosom the thousand dollar&#xD;
bill. Then sbe walked to a black walnut bureau, unlocked a&#xD;
small drawer, and took from it a bank book. Outside on the&#xD;
cover was marked "The American Savings Bank in account&#xD;
with Miss Clara Norris." *She opened it, and read off various&#xD;
sums. Five dollars, ten, fifty, eight, twelve, thirty-two, fifty,&#xD;
seventy-five, one hundred, two hundred.&#xD;
"Very good. This is a changing world. We do not know.&#xD;
what may happen. Mr. Nordheim thinks I am very extrava-&#xD;
gant. So I am-this book says I have already squandered in&#xD;
that Savings Bank eleven hundred dollars ;" and she rang the&#xD;
bell.- The colored-girl answered it.&#xD;
"Cheeky, I am going out to be gone an hour. If Mr. Nord-&#xD;
heim calls, say that if he will walk down Broadway to Stew-&#xD;
art's dry goods store, he will meet me coming up."&#xD;
The lady went out. In less than an hour she returned, and&#xD;
took the same book from her bosom. Another one thousand&#xD;
dollars had been placed to her credit ; and she carefully locked&#xD;
the book in the drawer, and placed the key around her-neck.&#xD;
" Now I must dress for the opera to-night. What will Nord-&#xD;
heim say? But Tom Granville .is. brother to his partner.&#xD;
Surely he can't object to my going with him-and if he does ?&#xD;
What a fool Tom Granville is! And yet I rather like him.&#xD;
So ,I do my mocking bird -Marion. But that Count-heigho!&#xD;
I wish I knew his history---it must be a -strange one."&#xD;
There was a curious grouping of people in the old Park&#xD;
Theatre that night. Stephen Price was the manager, assisted&#xD;
by quiet Simpson. The Woods were cramming the house every-&#xD;
night, and the treasury was overflowing. On this particular&#xD;
day the Woods had dined with Mr. Granville at his residence&#xD;
in State street, for he had been very kind to them, and was&#xD;
their banker. Colonel Mac Neil .was at the dinner, and one or&#xD;
two more. Mr. Wood insisted upon placing a private box at&#xD;
the disposal of Mr. Granville and his family, and the offer was&#xD;
accepted.&#xD;
Mr. Nordheim had also secured a front bench in the dress&#xD;
circle, He had invited Mrs. Tom Gronville and her sister Miss&#xD;
Madison Pinckney to go with him. H e knew that Walter&#xD;
Granville loved the latter, and so to have Mrs. Tom all to him-&#xD;
self, he invited Talter to go with him.&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheim, the day previous, had expressed a wish to&#xD;
hear the Woods, and Marion had been able to secure thre'o&#xD;
prominent seats..--and he invited his old friend Wilson to take&#xD;

tea in Bond street, and then go with Mrs. Nordhein and him..&#xD;
self to the theatre. This -was agreed to.&#xD;
When tie curtain rose that night, the pit, the dress circle&#xD;
and the *galleries presented from the foot-lights one sea of hu-&#xD;
man heads, and they were all -in raptures with the perform-&#xD;
ance. Brought sang "My Boyhood's Home " as it never has&#xD;
been sung since,.and Mrs. Wood enchanted the audience with&#xD;
"False one, I love Thee Still."&#xD;
When the curtain descended, people began to look about&#xD;
them. Marion was the first to utter an exclamation of sur-&#xD;
prise. The front seats 'occupied by his party' were directly&#xD;
opposite the centre of the stage. A little to the left was Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim, Mrs. Kate Granville, Walter Granville, and Miss&#xD;
Madison Pinckney. On the right hand stage private box was&#xD;
Mr. Granville and his family, including Col. Mac Neil, and in&#xD;
the opposite box was Mr.-Thomas Granville, the Count False-&#xD;
chinski, and Miss Clara Norris., Mr.. Nordheim smiled, and&#xD;
came around and spoke to his wife. Marion, when Mr. Nord-&#xD;
heim had left, pointed out Miss Norris to Mrs. Nordhein.&#xD;
The only person who felt particularly foolish was Tom Gran-&#xD;
ville. Mr. Nordheim informed Mrs. Tom who the lady was&#xD;
that Master Tom had charted a private box to accommodate.'&#xD;
The eyes of the brilliant Kate flashed fire. She felt humili-&#xD;
ated and disgraced, the more so, as Mr. Nordheim expressed&#xD;
the deepest sympathy, and mentioned the fact that the senior&#xD;
Granville and his party had been informed that Tom was in&#xD;
company with a kept mistress, and that it must be very annoy-&#xD;
ing to his brother! Poor Kate! Her love was fast changing,&#xD;
to contempt; and Tom was more confirmed in'his mad love for&#xD;
the beautiful woman by his side, as he noticed the withering&#xD;
glances that were bestowed upon her by those nearest and,&#xD;
dearest to him. Isabella Granville leaned on the front of the&#xD;
box, and attracted universal admiration. Marion seemed par-&#xD;
ticularly struck with her loveliness, and made some very en-&#xD;
thusiastic remarks in her favor to Mrs. Nordheiin. She sighed,&#xD;
and in a tone, of voice that was overheard by honest, tender-&#xD;
hearted Wilson, remarked,&#xD;
"Have a care, dear Marion; don't fall in love with- that&#xD;
trifler, or you will feel more sorrow than you ever yet have&#xD;
known.'&#xD;
Wilson seemed struck by the sigh and the remark with a'&#xD;
new idea, and he turned his eyes from the one to the other, but&#xD;
he did not say what he thought of it, even in "a financial point&#xD;
of view."&#xD;

Walter Granville did the worst thing he could have done.&#xD;
He tried to escape the observation of his father, and yet not&#xD;
actually neglect the fair Miss Pinckney by his side. It was of&#xD;
no use, for the senior Granville had a pair of eagle eyes, and&#xD;
his course was decided upon in his own mind.&#xD;
At last the opera was finished. Ton and the Count went to&#xD;
a supper party at a Broadway Saloon. The rest of those that&#xD;
we have.grouped together returned to their homes.&#xD;

A Marriage Arranged-Departure of Walter Granville-.Death of Airs.&#xD;

IT is not our purpose to write a philosophical work; if that were.&#xD;
the case, we might philosophise upoi the foolish but notorious&#xD;
fact, that a majority of parents, especially those who are pos.&#xD;
sessed of wealth and aristocratically descended, or in position,&#xD;
deem it a parental right to interfere in the marriages of their&#xD;
children, and if these children happen to form any attachment,&#xD;
and the object of such attachment does not happen to come up&#xD;
to the parents' standard of the husband-or wife, they have ar-&#xD;
ranged for their child, they or onc of the parents goes to work&#xD;
to break it off.&#xD;
Walter Granville was an only son. lHis father was most&#xD;
anxious that he should tread his own footprints, and be able to&#xD;
,succeed him in business, and to keep the name of Granville&#xD;
in the commercial world for anQther century at least. The&#xD;
father had given him a good education, and "Master, Wal-&#xD;
ter" had recently graduated at Columbia College, with consid-&#xD;
erable credit to himself. It was now11the purpose of the&#xD;
father to place his son in the counting-room, and -to haehim&#xD;
settle down in life, as he termed it. He had determined that&#xD;
Walter should marry at once. True, he was not out of his&#xD;
teens, but that'fact was of no importance to the senior Gran.&#xD;
ville. le had a horror of Walter falling in love with any&#xD;

connection. He had been driven almost to madness --for&#xD;
several-months, by having hints given him, that Walter was&#xD;
in love, and engaged to Miss Madison Pinckney. True, she&#xD;
was a very beautiful and a very accomplished girl. That is&#xD;
all very well so far as it goes, but to a mind like old Gran-&#xD;

ville's, there was nothing tangible ether in beauty or ac,&#xD;
complishments. He wished for his son's wife, something more&#xD;
reliable. He could give a business and settle money on his&#xD;
son, and-in choosing a wife for him, he wanted the other side of&#xD;
the house to be able to do the same thing. Heb had other&#xD;
objections to a marriage between Walter and Miss Madison.&#xD;
Pinckney. His brother had married one of the sisters, and one&#xD;
of the family was quite sufficient, as there was no money&#xD;
and never might be any. It all depended upon the caprice&#xD;
of a- "mean, mad, woman" as Tom designated the grand-&#xD;
mother of his wife.&#xD;
" If Walter will marry, I have a girl in view, that he shall&#xD;
marry, and I will make him do it at once, or know the reason&#xD;
why." - Thus spoke Pitt Granville to himself. The party that&#xD;
he had fixed upon was Miss Margaret Benson, the daughter of&#xD;
Colonel Benson, and one of the bridesmaids at the wedding of.&#xD;
Kate Pinckney.&#xD;
Colonel Benson had served in the English army, but he had&#xD;
married an American widow lady of wealth, who owned a&#xD;
plantation and several hundred negroes on Ashley River, near&#xD;
Charleston, South Carolina. He had resigned his commission&#xD;
in the British service and settled in New York, where he be-&#xD;
came a special partner in a commercial firm, largely engaged&#xD;
in the English trade. The Colonel held some sort of special&#xD;
agancy for the British Government, which gave him no small&#xD;
income. His wife had one son by her first husband, whose&#xD;
name was Glen Hammond.      The latter was a- wild haruni&#xD;
scarum 'fellow, who was travelling in Europe. By Colonel&#xD;
Benson she had two children, a son and a daughter.&#xD;
The name of the son was Middleton Benson. He was&#xD;
nearly of age, and w'as devoted to business, being engaged&#xD;
as a clerk where his father was a special partner. The daugh.-&#xD;
ter Margaret was a tall, dignified girl of eighteen years of age,&#xD;
very. haughty, and proud of her descent and her position. She&#xD;
worshiped her father and was not likely to fall in love with any&#xD;
man, except such a one as her father would approve.&#xD;
Colonel Benson and Mr. Granville were on the most intimate&#xD;
terms. If the latter had needed for any sudden emergency half&#xD;
a hundred thousand dollars, the Colonel would let him have it&#xD;
any day before three clock. They dined, supped and made&#xD;
excursions together, ari'd almost every evening if one did not&#xD;
come to the the house of the other, that other was sure to know&#xD;
the reason. The marriage of Walter and Margaret, had often&#xD;
been a topic of conversation between these two fathers. But&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
while Walter was at college, there was no need of being in a&#xD;
hurry. But the public attentions of Walter to Miss Pinckney&#xD;
at the Park Theatre had brought 'matters to a climax,, so far as&#xD;
Mr. Granville was concerned, and the next morning he -sent a&#xD;
note to Colonel Benson, asking him to dine in State street that&#xD;
day., The result of that dinner was, that Mr. Granville&#xD;
agreed to place Walter in business as soon as he was of age-to&#xD;
settle immediately upon him, real estate that should ,produce&#xD;
two thousand dollars clear income, and the Colonel agreed to&#xD;
give his daughter a house, and furnish it, and settle upon her&#xD;
and her children the income of thirty thousand dollars, two&#xD;
thousand dollars a year addition, and these conditions were to&#xD;
be complied with at once, and the marriage to take place&#xD;
without any delay. Both parents shook hands cordially when&#xD;
these preliminaries had been arranged, and then they agreed&#xD;
to drink an extra bottle of choice old Madeira to the health&#xD;
and prosperity of the 'to be' married couple.&#xD;
The same evening Mr. Granville called Walter to his&#xD;
room, and informed him of what he had done to settle him for&#xD;
life.  Walter listened, but did not say a word until his father&#xD;
had amplified and explained all the advantages of the match;&#xD;
he concluded, " Now, Walter, I want to hear your opinion."&#xD;
" My opinion or wishes seem to have been little consulted."&#xD;
"You do not mean to say that you ire not pleased with the&#xD;
arrangement I have made for you ?"&#xD;
" Has Margaret Benson been consulted ? Is she aware of.&#xD;
the honor about to be conferred on her ?"&#xD;
" What in the world has she got to do with the matter, so&#xD;
. far as we are concerned? ~ Her father will arrange with her.&#xD;
It is my duty to attend to your welfareand happiness.  Now&#xD;
Walter, speak out like a man. Don't have any foolish modes-&#xD;
ty. Of course you authorize me to say to Colonel Benson thae&#xD;
you are delighted with the prospect, and all that sort of thing,&#xD;
eh, Walter ?"&#xD;
Father, I believe you love me.  I do not think you have&#xD;
any thing nearer to your heart than my happiness. Is it not&#xD;
so ?"&#xD;
" Of course it is, my boy.  I love you better than I do my.&#xD;
self-and I flatter myself that if any proof were wanting that&#xD;
I love and care for you, this arrangement between Colonel&#xD;
Benson and myself made this afternoon, is enough to convince&#xD;
you of the farct."&#xD;

her."&#xD;

"Pooh, pooh, is that all?  You will soon learn to do so.&#xD;
You must marry her--I have given my word."&#xD;
"There is still another reason. I love another, and I have-&#xD;
promised'to marry that other."&#xD;
"You have! I think, Master Walter, that I have one or,&#xD;
two words to say about that. You mean Madison Pinckoey.&#xD;
She has not got a cent, and is very extravagant, -or will be so,&#xD;
if she ever gets a chance. No, no, Walter-drop all such non.-&#xD;
sense. I will give you until to-morrow before-I go to dine with&#xD;
Colonel Benson to think it over, and then,I think you will do&#xD;
as I wish."&#xD;
"Father, let it be settled now. I cannot give up Miss&#xD;
Pinckney, and I will not. My word is given to her. and my&#xD;
affections also. If you do not sanction my marriagewith her,&#xD;
I must do without it, or wait until yor do.  I will not marry&#xD;
Miss Benson under any circumstances. I do, not love her, nor&#xD;
could I have done so, had my love to Miss Pinckney never ex-&#xD;

" Nrow hear me,aitei- Granville.  From  this moment I&#xD;
disown you as entirely as-%if you had never been born. Go Gut&#xD;
of this house forever. Go and marry Miss Pinckney to-morrow&#xD;
if you choose, or go to the devil.  You have disobeyed your&#xD;
father, and I will disinherit you.  You have mortified me be-&#xD;
yond measure.   How can I look Colonel Benson in the face ?&#xD;
You need not go penniless. Take this money."&#xD;
Walter took it, and then flung it upon the floor.&#xD;
"Perish your money-I want none of it, and I will get out&#xD;
of the house before an hour. I merely wish to bid my mother&#xD;
and my sister good-bye-and farewell, Sir.- The day may come&#xD;
when you will regret this harsh treatment."&#xD;
"Never, sir. If you should change your mind, and come&#xD;
back obedient to my wishes,. you will be my son once more.&#xD;
Until that day comes, I care not to see you again. Begone !"1&#xD;
Walter Granville bowed and left the room. He was not long&#xD;
in packing a trunk with clothing. That done, he went to his&#xD;
mother, who was an invalid.  What passed between mother,&#xD;
and son is only known to them. Isabella was not at home. An&#xD;
hour after a hack conveyed Walter and his trunks to the City&#xD;
Hotel. He selected a room, and then hurried up to Chambers&#xD;
street to his Aunt Kate's. Madison Pinckney he felt could&#xD;
sympathize with him. He found her alone.&#xD;
Walter had yet to learn another lesson.  Madison Pinckney&#xD;
was perfectly cool and very calm, while Walter, whose mind&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
was frenzied, narrated all that had passed. At last Miss Madi-&#xD;
son spoke.&#xD;
"You are a silly boy, Walter. Quarrelled with your father,&#xD;
and he has turned you out of doors."&#xD;
" It was for your sake, dearest Madison. I could not marry&#xD;
Margaret Benson and continue to love you."&#xD;
" And pray, who, wished that you should?  But, Walter,&#xD;
you certainly have no idea that I am such an immense simple.&#xD;
ton as to dream of marrying you, after you have been cut&#xD;
adrift by your father.  I would do nothing of the kind.  We&#xD;
would starve in ?six weeks. Love is very fine if you have-&#xD;
money or business enough to keep house and be comfortable.&#xD;
Now I advise you to forget me as quick as possible, forif your&#xD;
father has fairly made up his mind against me, and in favor of&#xD;
another young lady as your wife, further' words are useless.&#xD;
He is not a man to change, and although as his son, you ,are-of&#xD;
some account in the world, yet cast off by. him I don't know&#xD;
what you will do."&#xD;
"But, Madison," exclaimed poor Walter, who was com-&#xD;
pletely heart-broken, " your letters-your caresses --.your&#xD;
promise.-your "-&#xD;
"Do, for mercy's sake, stop repeating that lover's cata-&#xD;
logue., I dare say I have been very foolish, but I did not&#xD;
dream that your father would oppose- your marriage with me.&#xD;
Now be a good boy.  My advice is to go to your papa.  Tell&#xD;
him you have been to.see me, and that youshave told me that&#xD;
you cannot marry me, and promise your father that you will&#xD;
marry Miss Benson any day that you. are called upon to, do&#xD;
so-'&#xD;
"My dream is over,".exclaimed. Walter. -Past-gne."&#xD;
"That is right, Walter. Wake up and.get over dreams as&#xD;
soon as possible. They are extremely unhealthy, and make&#xD;
people nervous. Come and see me as a friend any time that&#xD;
you have leisure. I must say good-night, now," -and she left&#xD;
the room. Walter seized his hat and hurried back to the City&#xD;
Hotel. He was enraged and mortified at himself. He did not&#xD;
go home to State street again. That evening he met with a wild&#xD;
young fellow that he had. known for some years--a regular&#xD;
New York boy.&#xD;
"I'm off to-morrow," said Charley King.&#xD;
"Where to ." enquired Walter.&#xD;
"On board a whaler bound round the Horn."&#xD;
" Could I get any berth aboard ?"&#xD;

"Certainly; and the skipper would be glad to get you.&#xD;

"Plenty."&#xD;
"TheQ let's have a regular night of it"&#xD;
Walter agreed. They visited every drinking place as long&#xD;
as any was open, and then returned to Walter's room. ,The&#xD;
next day Walter had shipped for a whaling voyage. . The ship&#xD;
Dorothea went to sea the next day, and it "was many months&#xD;
before Mr. Grunville ascertained what had become of his&#xD;
son.&#xD;
Meanwhile Mrs. Granville became worse. The loss of Wal-&#xD;
ter preyed upon her mind, and her strength failed daily. May&#xD;
arrived, and one morning Mr, Granville did -not come to the&#xD;
office. It was whispered that Mrs. Granville was worse-dy-&#xD;
ing.  Then a note came for Marion Monek to come at once to&#xD;
State street. When he arrived, the servant said he had orders&#xD;
to show him up to Mrs. Granville's sick room, where Mr.&#xD;
Granville was.  He entered the room. The proud merchant&#xD;
was weeping and kneeling by the bed, with a hand of his wife&#xD;
in his. Isabella, too, was sobbing as though her heart would&#xD;
break, Marioni was about to retire from so sacred a scene&#xD;
when the eyes of the dying woman fell upon him.  " Come&#xD;
here, Marion," she whispered, " give me your hand, and prom-&#xD;
ise me that you will be a faithful friend to my two children,&#xD;
and find the lost one, and tell him his mother blessed him be-&#xD;
fore she died." Marion promised. "They will need a true&#xD;
friend some day.  Be a brother to my poor Isabella.  God&#xD;
bless you." Marion left the room, but not the house. He re"&#xD;
mained in the parlor. some time elapsed, and then Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville came into the room, still sobbing.&#xD;
It is all over, She is dead. Close the office, and then&#xD;
come back for further directions. Biing Mr. Wilson down with&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
The Choera-Summer-Changes.&#xD;
THE funeral of Mrs. Pitt Granville was plain and simple,&#xD;
and according to the English movie. She was buried in a vault&#xD;
belonging to Mr. Granville, in St. Thomas' Church Yard. The&#xD;
office was closed the day she died and the day the funeral was&#xD;
celebrated. All the connexions went into deep mourning, and&#xD;
for a few days Mr. Granville forgot his usual gaiety.  The&#xD;
spring months passed away, and then came the summer, that&#xD;
terrible summer when the Asiatic cholera made its first ap-&#xD;
pearance in New York. What a scattering of people when&#xD;
the -facts became apparent that the long dreaded scourge was&#xD;
here! Mr. Granville took his 'daughter to the residence of&#xD;
Colonel Benson after Mrs. Granville's death, and when the&#xD;
cholera broke out sh'e. was with Colonel Benson and his&#xD;
daughter at Niagara Falls.&#xD;
Mr. Nordbeim eldsed up his house in Bond street, and found&#xD;
a refuge for his wife at the village of Woodbury, some twenty&#xD;
miles north of New Haven, Connecticut. lie did not remain&#xD;
but a week with his wife, and then started off on a tour of&#xD;
pleasure. Mrs. Tom Granville and her sister went to Saratoga,&#xD;
while Tom accompanied Clara Norris to her early home in&#xD;
Sussex County, New Jersey.&#xD;
Mr. Granville concluded -not to leave the city, and his ex-&#xD;
ample was followed by Mr. Wilson, the Count Falsechinski,&#xD;
and Marion Monck. Although the Count continued his lessons&#xD;
daily to Miss Norris up to the day of her departure, yet he&#xD;
had regarded them as a secondary affair. Save when absent&#xD;
to give these lessons, he had devoted every hour to business.&#xD;
He was at the-office early and late.  At last he heoame so&#xD;
useful to the book-keeper, that he made him his assistant, and&#xD;
Mr. Granville ordered his salary raised to eight hundred dol-&#xD;
lars per annum, and to be paid by the house, and not out of&#xD;
Mr. Nordheim's private funds. Mr. Granville invited Marion&#xD;
to take up his residence, at his house in State street to keep&#xD;
him company.&#xD;

ft would be a melancholy -chapter if I were to relate all that&#xD;
occurred in the city while the cholera raged here. It did not&#xD;
make Marion falter or flinch. At that time there was scarcely&#xD;
a store in Broad street except the one occupied by Granville&#xD;
&amp;amp; Nordheim. The street was filled with private residences&#xD;
and boarding-houses. Opposite to Mr. dranville's store,. at&#xD;
No. 24, was a boarding-house. -Marion counted in one -day&#xD;
nine coffins taken out of the one house, and that very evening&#xD;
he felt convinced that he had the cholera. Mr. Granville was&#xD;
alarmed, and made him go to bed, and sent for funny old Doc-&#xD;
tor Francis. He was shown'into Marion's room. There Ma-&#xD;
rion lay groaning with the cholera. The Doctor felt his pulse,&#xD;
asked some questions, and Marion related how many coffins he-&#xD;
had seen come out of No. 24 Broad street.    The Doctor.&#xD;
smiled, and ordered up a slice of bread. When it came up,&#xD;
he made up two or three small pills with it. Marion looked at.&#xD;
his proceedings with astonishment.&#xD;
"Take these pills ; they will cure you," said the Doctor.&#xD;
"Why, they are nothing but bread," said Marion, and he&#xD;
jumped up in a rage at the idea of the doctor making fan of&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Why, the very sight of my pills has' cured you," and the&#xD;
Doctor laughed heartily. Marion commenced dressing, and he&#xD;
could not help laughing also. - It was. catching. Mr. Granville&#xD;
laughed, and so did the servant.  "Nothing serious is the&#xD;
matter with you. You have no cholera. You have seen so&#xD;
many coffins to-day that your nerves have become excited, and&#xD;
you fancied you had the cholera. It's lucky for you, my boy,&#xD;
that I discovered the fact, or you might have had it in earnest,&#xD;
and perhaps died with it," said Doctor Francis, solemnly.&#xD;
The Doctor descended to the parlor, accompanied by Marion&#xD;
Monek and Mi-. Granville. A glass of old Madeira made Marion&#xD;
quite well, and when the D&amp;amp;ctor departed, he went part way&#xD;
home with him. Many persons in the hands of less sensible&#xD;
doctors died that summer with the cholera who had no more&#xD;
cholera at the commencement than did Marion. The doctors&#xD;
treated such cases as cholera, and they died of cholera.&#xD;
While the epidemic lasted, only once did Marion leave, the&#xD;
city, and then he obtained leave of absence for a week, and he&#xD;
spent it at the village where Mrs. Nordheim had gone.&#xD;
There -are some lovely villages in the State of Connecticut,&#xD;
and none more .so than the beautiful town of Woodbury, in&#xD;
the County of Litchfield. It is on the mail route between&#xD;
New Haven and Litchfield, and about fifteen miles south of the&#xD;

&#xD;
latter town. The town extends three miles, with houses pret-&#xD;
tily laid out along the whole line. There are three places of&#xD;
public worship, and one, the Episcopal, is located in the corner&#xD;
of a burying ground that has been used as such for over two&#xD;
centuries. At the south end of the burying-ground is a neat,&#xD;
well-kcpt inn, with a large garden that adjoins the- burying-&#xD;
ground. It was at this inn, or hotel,. that Mrs. Nordheim had&#xD;
obtained quarters during the prevalence of the epidemic in&#xD;
New York. When Marion obtained leave of absence for a&#xD;
week, he hurried up to this town, and he was delighted with it.&#xD;
It was such a contrast with a town in his own State of South&#xD;
Carolina, In the village where he .'as born there was not .a&#xD;
 school-house, and, in fact, not one within thirty miles. In this&#xD;
Connecticut town there were no less than five district schools,&#xD;
and one academy kept by one of the clergymen of the aforesaid&#xD;
churches. Marion soon became acquainted with the principal&#xD;
people. He attended singing schools, went on fishing excur-&#xD;
cursions, clambered over rocks, bathed in the river, and al-&#xD;
nost every day accompanied Mrs. Nordheim to spend 'the af-&#xD;
ternoon or evening with some one of the families' with. whom&#xD;
she had become acquainted.&#xD;
The Week of absence soon passed away, and he returned to&#xD;
the city. Mrs. Nordheim continued to reside at the village inn&#xD;
until the cheering news reached there that the cholera had&#xD;
abated in the great city. Arrangements were made for her&#xD;
return, and one lovely October morning she left the quiet&#xD;
country life to take her part again in the city of New York.&#xD;
One by one, family after family, returned to New York, and&#xD;
about the close of November the principal part of the ab-&#xD;
sentees had returned, and were as gay and devoted to worldly&#xD;
pleasures and pursuits as though the Almighty had not sent a&#xD;
destroying angel into the city to remove hy sudden and horrid&#xD;
deaths a large portion of the unthinking population.&#xD;

A YEAR passed away from the time when the scattered and&#xD;
scared persons alluded to in our story returned to the city after&#xD;
the cholera summer. During that year few changes or occur-&#xD;
rences took place worth noticing. The duties of the counting&#xD;
house of Granville and Nordheim were carried on as usual, and&#xD;
their business increased rapidly. Mr. Nordheim was absent&#xD;
from the city, or engrossed with schemes-,of his own personal&#xD;
pleasure. After the death of his wife, and the departure of&#xD;
his son Walter, Mr. Granville seemed to lose a portion of that&#xD;
business energy that so strongly characterized him. These&#xD;
two facts flung a greater responsibility upon Marion Monek,&#xD;
and Mr. Granville had already entrusted hiu with a power of&#xD;
attorney to sign the name of the firm. It was a great trust for&#xD;
so young a man, as Marion was not quite nineteen years old.&#xD;
But he was of the right metal, and this confidence served as a&#xD;
more powerful incentive to renewed activity and devotion to'&#xD;
the business of his employers.&#xD;
The Count Falsechinski,,during the eighteen months that&#xD;
followed the cholera summer was not idle. He devoted his&#xD;
time to- the duties of the office, and by a careful economy had&#xD;
increased his deposits with his bankers, Prime, Ward and King.&#xD;
He had become acquainted with the different members of that&#xD;
distinguished firm, and one of the partners made a suggestion&#xD;
to the -Count, in reference to taking an interest in a purchase&#xD;
of stock, which was to be "cornered," which proved valuable;&#xD;
for the Count availed himself of it to quite a large amount, at&#xD;
least to four times his capital, his bankers making the pur-&#xD;
chase, and retaining as a i margn " the funds of the Count in&#xD;
their hands. Onp December morning, the Count received a&#xD;
note from his bankers, requesting him to call at the banking&#xD;

house, No. 42 Wall street, early in the morning, and Mr. Ward&#xD;
surprised him by saying,&#xD;
"Count, you are aware that our firm purchased for your&#xD;
account ten thousand dollars' worth of Morris Canal stock. It&#xD;
has advanced fifty per cent. on the price we paid. Shall we&#xD;
sell it at the Board to-day?  I think it has reached a high&#xD;
limit. It may go higher, but you will make a good thing of it&#xD;
at yesterday's quotations. What doyou say ?"&#xD;
The Count had very little to say, except to authorize the&#xD;
sale at the Board that day. His orders were complied with.&#xD;
The stock had advanced still more, and when the Count's bank&#xD;
book wag wrote up and handed him next day, lie found that he&#xD;
had to his credit bver eight thousand dollars. This did not&#xD;
move -him. He was the same quiet, smiling, unobtrusive&#xD;
Count. He attended in Broome street, and gave his lessons&#xD;
to Miss Norris regularly ; and that young lady was already an&#xD;
excellent Spanish and Germanc scholar, as well as, French,&#xD;
which was the first language he 'taught her. Frequently he&#xD;
met Tom Granville at the residence of Miss Norris, but the&#xD;
Count took very little notice of him on such occasions, nor did&#xD;
the notorious fact that Tom was perfectly fascinated with the&#xD;
beautiful and accomplished girl seem to disturb the usual' plaw&#xD;
cidity of the Count. Occasionally, when he called to give a&#xD;
lesson,.he met Mr. Nordheim in the house of Miss Norris~and&#xD;
he seemed pleased with the progress that his protege had made.&#xD;
Our readers will remember that Tom Granville had made an&#xD;
arrangement with Mr. Nordheim to take Miss Norris off his&#xD;
hands in a specified time. He had signally failed; for al-&#xD;
though it was quite apparent that\,Clara likcd Tom, yet her&#xD;
ambition to learn, and the advantages she had in her present&#xD;
relations with Mr. Nordheim, made her decline in the most&#xD;
positive manner all overtures to change, or make any arrange-&#xD;
ment with Master Tom. Now and then, when Tom, became&#xD;
clamorous for funds, Clara would give him a few tens from the&#xD;
amounts she received from Mr. Nordheim, but she never wont&#xD;
to draw money from the Savings Bank. She received Mr. Tom&#xD;
Granville's- attentions without the slightest objection. She-&#xD;
allowed him to escort her to public places on- all occasions, and&#xD;
it would almost seem that she was aware of the secret purpose&#xD;
of Mr. Nordheiin, but she kept her own counsel in this respect.&#xD;
Tom occasionally spoke of his progress to Mr. Nordheim. The&#xD;
latter merely smiled, with a few words, such as, " Well, Ton,&#xD;
more money, I suppose." Tom would leave with -a hundred&#xD;
7   dollars in his pocket. He still kept house in Chambers street,&#xD;

but left his wife to get on as well as she could ; but whenr she&#xD;
needed advice, she found an adviser in Mr. Nordheim, who&#xD;
was a regular-visitor in Chambers street, and escorted Mrs.&#xD;
Tom Granville to nearly every private party which she at-&#xD;
tended. Many who had met them frequently in public, thought&#xD;
that they were Mr. and Mrs. Nordheim.&#xD;
Meanwhile Marion Monck was residing in Bond street,&#xD;
where lie had.removed when Mrs. Nordheim returned from&#xD;
the country after the cholera. Marion and Bessy were like&#xD;
brother and sister.&#xD;
Another visitor now made his appearance in Bond street,&#xD;
and not a Sunday passed that he did not dine at Mrs. Nord-&#xD;
heiun's. . This was no less a personage than our serious, me-&#xD;
thodical old bookkeeper, Mr. Wilson. His attachment to Ma-&#xD;
rion, his sterling integrity and good sense, had rendered Mr.&#xD;
Wilson a great favorite with Mi's. Nordheim, and a welcome&#xD;
visitor..I He was a safe man, and the lady felt that'he was one&#xD;
of those that could be relied upon in a case of emergency,&#xD;
should such a case ever approach he'r home. The Count False-&#xD;
chinski was also a regular visitor at Bond street. le was ac-&#xD;
complished, and helped to while away many an hour pleasantly&#xD;
that without his music and animated conversation would have&#xD;
beep dull and cheerless.&#xD;
December had arrived, and it was near the anniversary of&#xD;
Marion's birth-day. Mrs. Nordheim had determined to make,&#xD;
some preparations for the day when her " brother Marion"&#xD;
would be nineteen years old. She had consulted with the&#xD;
Count and with Mr. Wilson, as to what she should do to make&#xD;
the occasion an agreeable one, and .to be remembered. They&#xD;
advised a party in the evening, and this was decided upon.&#xD;
"'Marion," said the lady, a few days before the event was to&#xD;
happen, "I ain goilg to give a small party on the evening of&#xD;
your birth-day. I hope the idea will please you."&#xD;
"Most unquestionably; whatever you do, dear Bessy,&#xD;
pleases me., I have a happy home, and I ought to be very&#xD;
thankful to you. I wish you would tell me how I can be suffi-&#xD;
ciently grateful for all your goodness and kindness to me."&#xD;
"By telling me who to invite that you 'know, and that I do&#xD;
not. See, here is the list of those I have already invited."&#xD;
Marion took the list, and carefully read over the names..&#xD;
Why, you seem to be better acquain-ted with the names of&#xD;
my friends, Bessy, than I am myself; and yet there is one&#xD;
name that is not on the list, and I wish you would invite the&#xD;
Person. I have met him frequently, and he has behaved with&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
100&#xD;
&#xD;
great civility to me. I know of no way to return it except by&#xD;
inviting him here. I will take the invitation when you have&#xD;
filled it up, and deliver it myself. Here is the name."  And&#xD;
Marion wrote in pencil upon. a slip of paper, "John O'Doemall."&#xD;
The name was transferred to an envelope, and in the course&#xD;
of the day Marion delivered it to the party for whom it was&#xD;
intended. H6 found Mr. O'Doemall in his room at the City&#xD;
Hotel, for this Irish gentleman never stopped at any place ex-&#xD;
cept it was the first-class hotel.&#xD;
As Mr. O'Doemall will be frequently introduced into this&#xD;
local history, it will perhaps be as well that AI should give a&#xD;
brief'narrative of his career from the time he reached our hos-&#xD;
pitable American shore, until he makes. his appearanee as one&#xD;
of the leading characters in our story.&#xD;
Irelan'd never sent to the United States a more p'erfeet gen-&#xD;
tleman than John O'Doemall. He claimed to be an Irish peer,&#xD;
but in disguise. He spoke the Spanish language as well as&#xD;
English, was really handsome, very aristocratic in his bearing&#xD;
dressed well, had the manners and used fluently the language&#xD;
of an educated gentleman. He was a fascinating lady-killer.&#xD;
le could discoarse of beautiful scenery, Moorish palaces, the&#xD;
Alhambra, Mount Zion, and the river Jordan, life in Spain, in&#xD;
Germany, France, Holland, Greece and, the East, including Je-&#xD;
rusalem, Grand Cairo, and Mecca. There could be no doubt&#xD;
but that Mr. O'Doemall had been a very great traveller. Ex-&#xD;
claim suddenly "Jack-you Jack!" and Mr. O'Doemall-would&#xD;
jump up, hastily and reply, " Ay, ay, my Lord !"  This was&#xD;
tried on frequently by doubtful people, who had heard of this&#xD;
peculiar trait in this original Irish character. There seemed&#xD;
DO possible e way of accounting for it, except by surmising that&#xD;
gentlemanly Jack had been, at no very remote period, a valet&#xD;
to some Irish or English peer, and had travelled with the said&#xD;
peer in those countries which-Mr. O'Doemall could talk so&#xD;
learnedly about. This was probably the true secret of the for-&#xD;
mer occupation of the Irish adventurer. Doubtless he had com-&#xD;
mitted some rascality that had pai-ted him from his' noble&#xD;
patron, and rendered it necessary that he should try the Ame-&#xD;
rican continent. He landed from a Liverpool packet ship of&#xD;
the Black Ball line, but as his name never appeared in the&#xD;
list of cabin passengers, it was reasonably supposed that he&#xD;
came in the steerage. Before he had been in New-York a&#xD;
week, he could have been found at the City Hotel, located in&#xD;
a comfortable apartment, and perfectly at home.&#xD;
One day at dinner his agreeable, gentlemanly, language&#xD;

"*if&#xD;

&#xD;
made an impression upon a neighbor at the table who formed&#xD;
one of a group of gentlemen that were sipping their wine toge-&#xD;
ther after most of the other diners had left the table. This&#xD;
gentleman invited John to take a glass of wine with him, and&#xD;
finally to draw his chair nearer and join the drinking party.&#xD;
John cheerfully accepted the invite, and before another hour&#xD;
had passed he had made a still more decided impression upon&#xD;
the individual alluded to. The conversation became general,&#xD;
and John was brilliant. One of the party having made a state-&#xD;
ment that anybody could earn a living in thi4 country, was&#xD;
asked by John O'Doemall the following question :&#xD;
"How can a reduced Irish gentleman earn an honorable&#xD;
living ?"&#xD;
Easily enough ; provided he is not too proud to take any&#xD;
situation that offers."&#xD;
"What position could I get ?" asked John.&#xD;
"I have but one that I could offer you," was the reply. "I&#xD;
keep a hotel at West Point, and I need a bar-keeper."&#xD;
"And if you think I would suit you I accept the situation,"&#xD;
said O'Doimall.&#xD;
The bargain was concluded, and Mr. O'Doemall received a&#xD;
sufficient sum to pay his hotel bill. The next day he left the&#xD;
city in company with his new employer, and before the week&#xD;
had passed he was concocting drinks for the pupils of Uncle&#xD;
Samuel's great-military establishment near the Highlands.&#xD;
This worthy hotel proprietor had a young and very beautiful&#xD;
sister. Of course it was not long before Mr. O'Doemall be-&#xD;
came acquainted with this sister, and also with..the fact that she&#xD;
had the snug little sum of ten thousand dollars in her own&#xD;
right, which sum would beconie hers the very day she married.&#xD;
What arts so accomplished a traveller as Mr..O'lDoemall used&#xD;
with a simple country girl to fascinate her, it is needless to&#xD;
mention. They can be easily guessed. How quietly and how&#xD;
adroitly everything was managed was-wonderful. Had a thun-&#xD;
derbolt pitched into the brain of the worthy landlord, he could&#xD;
not have been more astonished, than when one afternoon, just&#xD;
as he was preparing to take a siesta after dinner, his barkeeper&#xD;
requested a private interview. Somewhat astonished at the&#xD;
request, the landlord complied. When they were alone, Mr.&#xD;
O'Doemall remarked,&#xD;
"1I believe sir I have been -with you three months?  Per-&#xD;
fectly satisfied with my manner of performing my duties ?"&#xD;
" I have no particular fault to find, Jack," said Mr. Cozzens.&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
105&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, sir, I shall leave ydu in the down boat this evening,&#xD;
and shall take my wife with me."&#xD;
"Your wife! I didn't know you had a wife!' Where the&#xD;
devil have you kept her ?"&#xD;
"I have only been married about a week, sir. Perhaps you&#xD;
will have the kindness to read this certificate. It slightly con-&#xD;
cerns you, and when you are satisfied, I shall expect some sort&#xD;
of arrangement in reference to the trifling sum of about ten&#xD;
thousand dollars that you are trustee for, and I will henceforth&#xD;
relieve you of the duties of trusteeship.",&#xD;
"Intriguing, d---- scoundrel !" was the only comment ut-&#xD;
tered by the landlord,  s he read the certificate. "Bring your&#xD;
wife here immediately.&#xD;
"With pleasure."&#xD;
The girl came. But why prolong such a scene? The bro-&#xD;
ther's horror-a woman's faith. O'Doemall secured her pro-&#xD;
perty-had it placed in his wife's hands, and a few days after&#xD;
the husband and wife came to New York. Before six months,&#xD;
O'Doemall had the whole sum in~a bank in his own name. He&#xD;
had wheedled his poor wife into giving him the money. le&#xD;
took a store down town, and commenced business as a wine&#xD;
merchant. Before a year had expired, the poor wife died in&#xD;
giving birth to a child. O'Doemall was all right. He had&#xD;
secured the money safe by proper deeds and gifts, and was&#xD;
now a regular boarder at the City Hotel--as more than ayear&#xD;
had elapsed since the death of his wife.&#xD;
Had Marion Monek been aware of these interesting antece-&#xD;
dents, I question whether Mr. O'Doemall would have been in-&#xD;
vited to his quiet home. Marion knew nothing of them. He&#xD;
had first met O'Doemall at the rooms of Colonel Mac Neil. He&#xD;
had been introduced to him as a merchant of,-apital, and he&#xD;
had perceived that he was an-agreeable man of the world. Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim also associated with and recognized him, and besides&#xD;
Mr. O'Doemall had bought of the firm a large bill of wines, and&#xD;
he had paid the cash for them. With such and other collateral&#xD;
evidences of respectability, what occasion had Marion to hesi-&#xD;
tate about introducing him to his home circle ? He had ione.&#xD;

Mrs. Nordhei'm gives a Party-Marion Monck is nineteen years old -John&#xD;

ruff-Maron and Is ibetla Grariville-A n offer and an acceptance - Sccrtcy&#xD;
enjoined-An anecdote of the Author's "first love."&#xD;
TiHE eventful day arrived.  Marion Monck was, nineteen a&#xD;
years old.  He did not make his appearance that day at the&#xD;
office of Granville &amp;amp; Nordheim, except for an hour or two in&#xD;
the morning, and he returned to Bond street to assist Bessy&#xD;
Nordheim in the event of her needing such assistance.&#xD;
"Bessy,. I have invited more people without your permis-&#xD;
sion.",&#xD;
" Pshaw. What do I care for that ?  I have invited a few&#xD;
more than I had on iny list. But we have room-plenty of&#xD;
room, and I shall have a gay, happy time of it.  Our party&#xD;
will be a regular old fashioned party, Marion.  I will not&#xD;
have one uncomfortable if I can help it.  But pray, Marion,&#xD;
whom have you invited ?"&#xD;
" First. Mr. John O'Doemall; but you know all about that'&#xD;
Next, a person connected with the press-with one of the&#xD;
daily papers.- He is a young Scotchman, and used to live in&#xD;
Charleston."&#xD;
" That alone, to a Charleston girl, is almost a sufficient letter&#xD;
of introduction, without any other. What is his name ?")&#xD;
" Bennett-James Gordon Bennett.     I was introduced to&#xD;
him at Mrs. Coffin's, the large boarding house on the corner of&#xD;
Broadway and Wall street, opposite Trinity Church.  I like&#xD;
him very much. ,He is quiet-very intelligent, and you will&#xD;
be pleased with him, Bessy."&#xD;
"Very likely. Who else have you invited ?"&#xD;
"Then I frequent Ned Windust's Shakespere, near the&#xD;
Park Theatre. I have invited two friends from that region,&#xD;
although I had previously met them both at Colonel Mac Neil's&#xD;
room at the City Hotel.  They help fill up, and are perhaps&#xD;
as much my friends as many others that will be here. One is&#xD;
a literary man named Cedar. 'He writes for the Weekly&#xD;
Mirror, and for some of the monthly journals, and he also&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
107&#xD;
&#xD;
writes novels. He promised me one, which I will give to you&#xD;
when I get it.  The other is a young doctor and surgeon&#xD;
named Carnochan. He is also Southron like you, only born in&#xD;
Florida instead of South Carolina.  He has been quite a trav-&#xD;
eller in getting surgical knowledge.  He studied in scotland&#xD;
three years-in Paris he walked the hospitals four years, and&#xD;
was several years the favorite pupil of one of the first surgeons&#xD;
in this citi-Doctor Mott."&#xD;
"Then I suppose he has a large practice."&#xD;
"In playing billiards, I dare say yes, but as for private&#xD;
practice, I do not, Bessy, believe he Vias a solitqy patient in&#xD;
New York.   He is a gay man-good looking-rather careless&#xD;
--has a prospect of property, and-well, I think he lives off&#xD;
those prospects, and a few dollars he gets now and then from&#xD;
a rich uncle."&#xD;
a  like him already.  He must be an original, and when&#xD;
night comes, if your three friends come also, I will try and&#xD;
make them at home, and that is ill I can do. Have you no&#xD;
curiosity to know who I have invited ?"&#xD;
"to be sure I have. Do I know them?"&#xD;
"Yes and no. You have observed the wealthy widow lady&#xD;
that lives next door to us."&#xD;
"Certainly-Mrs. Woodruff is the name ori the silver door-&#xD;
plate, Jam glad she is to be here. Do you know I have a&#xD;
great admiration for her?  She lives so quiet, no noise, sees&#xD;
few friends, has her pet rabbits, parroquets and parrots, mock-&#xD;
ingbirds, canaries and dogs. Why, I have tried to steal her&#xD;
beautiful fawn colored Italian greyhound half a dozen tines,&#xD;
but I did not like to be so unneighborly."&#xD;
"I am glad that you are pleased with my inviting her, for&#xD;
you will shaie the responsibility of the act with me to Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim. I do not knQw how it is, but on one or two occa-&#xD;
sions when I have mentioned the name of our lady-liko neigh-&#xD;
bors in his hearing, he has turned up his nose one degree&#xD;
more, and then followed such a curious expression upon his&#xD;
face that I asked him once if he knew  any harm  of Mrs.&#xD;
Woodruff.&#xD;
"Pray, what reply did he make ?"&#xD;
. "Nordheim said be did not know any harm of her, on the&#xD;
contrary, that he believed she was highly connected, and that&#xD;
her husband was a man of great genius,/and died wealthy,&#xD;
leaving her a princely fortune and no-children."&#xD;
" She has some of the handsomest eqjuipages in town call at&#xD;
her door," observed Marion.&#xD;

"That is true. We have occasionally spoken when we have&#xD;
met at the door, andthis morning I boldly asked her to be&#xD;
present this evening, and she accepted. In addition, I have&#xD;
invited Mr.and-Mrs. Parker and their beautiful niece Julia.&#xD;
They live up the street, and called upon me and Mr. Nordheim&#xD;
yesterday. They are immensely' rich, have, retired from busi-&#xD;
ness, and are very desirable people to know.  Mrs. Parker&#xD;
prides herself upon being one of the principal leaders of&#xD;
fashion. She is only twenty-five years old, while he is fifty if&#xD;
he is a day.' The niece is but seventeen. But who is ringing&#xD;
away at that door-bell ?- Is there nobody to answer, it?  Go,&#xD;
Marion, to th door yourself."  I&#xD;
Marion went and opened the door, and returned, leading by&#xD;
the hand, Isabella Granville. The look of intense admiration&#xD;
with which Marion gazed at-the beautiful girl whose 'hair fell&#xD;
over her face, her cheeks red with excitement, and her eyes&#xD;
dancing with joy, was not lost upon ,Bessy Nordheim. She&#xD;
was rather cool at first, but it did not last long. -&#xD;
"I have come to help you, dear Mrs. Nordheim. Papa said&#xD;
I might come, and I will do all in my power to relieve you of&#xD;
your care about the party," said Isabella.  lI&#xD;
"Thank you, Isa; but I must be at work, so I will leave&#xD;
you and Marion to amuse each other."&#xD;
, Mrs. Nordheim left the parlor to go and look after the ser-&#xD;
vants. Poor Marion. - Isabella Granville took off her bonnet,,&#xD;
then her shawl, and then Marion seated himself by her side.&#xD;
They: chatted and 'laughed, and finally Isabella adjourned to&#xD;
the' piano, played several favorite airs, and sang the words.&#xD;
Marion stood by and drank in every note. Isabel -looked up&#xD;
at him, when she had finished. "Isa."  It was all he said,&#xD;
and then he took her hand in his, and led her back to the sofa.&#xD;
He put his arm around her waist, and again repeated,- "Isa, I&#xD;
love you."  She did not make any reply, but leaned her head&#xD;
over on his shoulder. The perfume of her hair almost took&#xD;
away his breath. He kissed her forehead, and then, more.&#xD;
bold, he pressed her pouting, cherry-ripe lips-..-not once, but&#xD;
a dozen times, and-she returned it.&#xD;
Mrs. Bessy Nordheim, where were you all this while ?&#xD;
Down in the kitchen-the sweat pouring out of your face, as&#xD;
you gave hurried directions about the baking and cooking&#xD;
arrangements; and he for whom you were making all these&#xD;
extra preparations, was only over your head, giving away his&#xD;

"Isa, I love you. Do you love me in return ?"&#xD;
"5Oh, yes; very much indeed. I love you a great deal&#xD;
more than I ever did Frank Clacksome, or that stupid William&#xD;
Senless, although I did love them once, but' I dn't now. I&#xD;
have loved you ever sinee-let me see-ever since my&#xD;
mother"died. But you must Dot tell any body that I love&#xD;
you," simpered Isabella.k&#xD;
Of course, dear Isa, you will let me speak to your father&#xD;
and"-said Marion, earnestly.&#xD;
"Oh, no. Certainly not. The idea of such a thing is per-&#xD;
fectly frightful. Why, he would lock me up, beat me-.I don't-&#xD;
know what he. wouldn't do. He would very likely make me&#xD;
marry Middleton, Benson at an hour's notice, as he tried to&#xD;
make Walter marry his sister, and you know I could not run&#xD;
away and go to sea, as Walter did. Now don't look so cross,&#xD;
Marion. Kiss me again," was Isabella's reply.&#xD;
Marion complied, and told Isabel that he thought she was&#xD;
alarmed without cause. "Why. should your father object to.&#xD;
me ? I am only .nineteen, it is true, but you are very young.&#xD;
We can wait, dear Isa. Howeve, I will do as you wish; but&#xD;
will you promise to marry me when your father gives his con-&#xD;
sent 9"&#xD;
"'obe sure I will. But then you are not to ask him&#xD;
and not to say a-word to a soul alive until I tell you that you&#xD;
may. I will be very angry if you do," observed Isabella.&#xD;
Marion promised. All further conversation was interrupted&#xD;
by the entrance of Mrs. Nordheim, who was too much excited&#xD;
by her culinary troubles -to give any heed or even to notice&#xD;
the sheepish looks of the two young friends. She called upon&#xD;
Isabel to go up stairs with her, and Marion was alone. It was&#xD;
his first love. There was a pretty face, his employer's daugh-&#xD;
Ster--and imagination must dQ the rest. He thought Isabella&#xD;
perfection itself; but- he was only nineteen years old, and as&#xD;
ignorant of the sort of partner he had been making love to as&#xD;
though he had never seen her. Youth must love something&#xD;
If it is not a reality, it will be an ideality. I well remember&#xD;
that my first, love was ahyoung girl that I first saw in St.&#xD;
George's church. I attended that church in  eiekman street&#xD;
t   iwo years for no other earthly or heavenly purpose exempt to&#xD;
see her every Sunday. I did not know her name even. Then&#xD;
I went to the East Indies-to Canton-was gone a year. Eight&#xD;
months of 'that period I was at sea, and I walked the deck at&#xD;
night and indulged thoughts of her. I deamed of her. All&#xD;
my aspirations of future, success in life were associated with.&#xD;

her. When I returned, I hurried to that church,. for it (was&#xD;
Sunday morning when I landed from my Canton voyage.- I&#xD;
found her there. That Sunday I cultivated the sexton, and&#xD;
ascertained her name and where her parents lived. It was&#xD;
opposite St. John's Park. There for weeks after dark, I used&#xD;
to go and sit on the stone foundation of the iron railing, and&#xD;
look at the house that contained the object of my admiration,&#xD;
and so four years passed. Then I,commenced sending he'r&#xD;
anonymous but costly presents; I wrote her poetry, and used&#xD;
up another year, but no hope dawned. I began to see daylight.&#xD;
I had lent two hundred dollars to a wretched cousin of my fair&#xD;
flame: and he agreed to introduce me to the family. " When ?"&#xD;
I asked. "One of the daughters is to be married next week,&#xD;
and I will get you an invitation."  Capital," I replied. I3ut&#xD;
what is the name of the daughter that is to be married ?" I&#xD;
asked, with a shiver. ".Susan," was the reply.  The uni-&#xD;
verse seemed to me to have capsized for about five minutes.&#xD;
" Susan " was the name of the daughter that I had so long&#xD;
loved, and that I had regarded as my wife. She was to marry,&#xD;
and did marry a man named Wilson. I have hated that name&#xD;
ever since. I contemplated having Susan arrested for spirit-&#xD;
ual bigamf'; but wais too much occupied to commence pro-&#xD;
ceedings. Then, again, as I had never 'spoken spoken a word&#xD;
to her in'mv life, it made it so odd. That was' my first love.-&#xD;
my puppy'love-and it was deep in the heart. Susan has&#xD;
children-ay" g4 dchildren-now, but I never see her in the&#xD;
street, meet her in church, but soft, pleasant memories will&#xD;
stead over me of my long-tried love. The only thing painful&#xD;
about it is that I did not say something to Susan at the time.&#xD;
It was all one side. I ought to have let her know something&#xD;
about it, and the chances are decidedly in favor of the suppo-&#xD;
tiom that the. abominable, plodding Wilson that made my,&#xD;
Susan Mrs. W. would have been nowhere.&#xD;
But to return to Marion Monck. H e was obliged to fall in&#xD;
love with somebody or something. lie was honest as the day&#xD;
was long. RHe would not commit a wrong. He liked essay&#xD;
Nordheim. He never dreamed of loving her, because she&#xD;
was his employer's wife ; and for want of a better real to his&#xD;
ideal in soul, he fell in love with Isabella Granville. She&#xD;
remained until afternoon in Bond street, and then Marion&#xD;
accompanied her home in State street, where she went to dress&#xD;
to+return to the party that evening. That party must com-&#xD;

The Count Falsechin ki at the party -He ofers to go to church- The party&#xD;

THERE was a vast difference between an evening party thir-&#xD;
ty years ago, and now. In those days, the hour in the even-&#xD;
ing rh en the guests assembled at the hospitable mansion was&#xD;
much earlier, and the hour when the party dissolved was not&#xD;
later than midnight.  The refreshmants were of a different&#xD;
order. Then there were the solid, old-fashioned mahogany&#xD;
sideboards, filled with good things, and covered with substan-&#xD;
tial eatables and drinkables.  There, was choice old South-&#xD;
side Madeira that had been in 3ask forty years. There Was&#xD;
old cider for old-fashioned'people, and quantities of cut glass&#xD;
dishes overloaded with cracked hickory nuts.  Rhode Islnd&#xD;
Greenings and Spitzbergen apples were piled up on famous&#xD;
large crockery open-work dishes, and the young people could&#xD;
eat nuts and do courting at the aforesaid sideboards. Then&#xD;
the supper was a substantial supper, with oysters done in every&#xD;
style, and cold turkey and chicken, apd knives and forks and&#xD;
plates, and above all, room for all the guests to'partake of the&#xD;
good cheer in comfort. There was a room for the supper.&#xD;
There was room for those who danced, and room for those who&#xD;
played whist, or who wished to converse.&#xD;
Those were good old days, but they have changed for the&#xD;
worse. Few of our readers but what know from personal e-&#xD;
perience the difference between such a party as we have dese&#xD;

Before eight o'clock on the evening of Marion Monok's birh-&#xD;
day, the two large parlors of Mr. Nordheim's spacious resi-&#xD;
d'nce in B.nd street were partly but not uncomfortably filled&#xD;

with the persons to whom invitation had been sent. There,&#xD;
was not one missing.&#xD;
Mr. Nordheim could act the gentleman when he chose to do&#xD;
so, and on this occasion he spared no pains to make every one&#xD;
feel at home. His partner, William Pitt Granville and Isa-&#xD;
bella were among the first to arrive ; and soon after, Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Tom Granville, accompanied by Miss Madison Pinckney,&#xD;
were announced.. Tom had no sooner entered than he was&#xD;
hurried to the piano by Miss Benson, who knew how delight-&#xD;
fully Tom  played upon that instruirient.  Colonel Benson&#xD;
joined Pitt Granville, and with Colonel Mac Neil and Mr. Ce-&#xD;
dar the author, a whist party was made up.&#xD;
Marion did the honors to a certain extent, for as fast as&#xD;
those arrived to Whom he had specially given Invitations, and&#xD;
who were personally unknown to Mrs. Nordheim, he presented&#xD;
them by name to the latter lady. Mr. Bennett and .Mr. Wilson&#xD;
came in together, and after the former' had been presented to&#xD;
the hostess, he-retired quietly to an ottoman in a corner of the&#xD;
room, and there remained until Mr. Wilson went and tdok a;&#xD;
seat by his side.&#xD;
I suppose you will join the dancers presently," said honest&#xD;
Wilson.&#xD;
' No indeed. I don't dance. I prefer looking on.  It is&#xD;
very rare that I go out to a party, and when I do I have my&#xD;
own way of enjoying myself. As you seem to know most of&#xD;
the people here, you will confer a great favor upon me if you&#xD;
will tell me all about them. I am very fond of studying cha-&#xD;
racters, and I am much deceived if you have not some origin-&#xD;
als here .to-night. Mrs. Nordheim is a. beautiful woman-&#xD;
which is her husband ?" asked Mr. Bennett.&#xD;
"1That Jewish-looking man talking with Mr. Thomas Gran-&#xD;
vle," replied Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
" I've seen him before. I'conversed with his lady a few&#xD;
moments about Charleston; I must have seen him at the&#xD;
South," was Mr. Bennett's observation.&#xD;
"Very likely : and Mr. Nordheim is a man, that if you.see&#xD;
him once, you are not likely to forget him.  He is not re-&#xD;
markable for his beauty, but he is clever in a financial point&#xD;
of view, said Wilson.&#xD;
Here Mr. and Mrs. Parker and Miss Julia Parker were an-&#xD;
nounced, and soon after were cordially received by the host&#xD;
and hostess. The latter introduced Marion, and he offered his&#xD;
arm to conduct Miss Julia to a seat. Mrs. Parker and' her&#xD;
husband followed. Soon after, Mr. Nordheim, accompanied by&#xD;
&#xD;
113&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. O'Doemall, introduced him to Mrs. Parker, and the hus-&#xD;
band went off to find Mr. Granville, who was an old acquaint.&#xD;
ance. These parties are disposed of, and we' now return to&#xD;
Mr. Bennett and Mr. Wilson. Mr. Bennett remarked,&#xD;
"Those last arrivals seem to create quite, a sensation.; who&#xD;
are they, Mr. Wilon ?"&#xD;
"Oh.e Mr. Parker is as rich as Crosus-retired from' all&#xD;
sorts of business, married a handsome wife only %one third as&#xD;
old as he is, and they live up the street in princely style,"' was&#xD;
the reply of Mr. Wilson&#xD;
"Their daughter isan elegant girl," said Mr. Bennett.&#xD;
"She is only a niece, and- the aunt is very jealous of her.&#xD;
Do you see that nice young man who is paying such devoted&#xD;
attention to Mrs. Pai-ker ?" asked Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
Yes ; who is he ?" asked Mr. Bennett.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson rolled up his eyes as he replied, "From all ac-&#xD;
counts, he is a hard case, in a financial point of view. I don't&#xD;
know much about him. He is abld to make the female sex be-&#xD;
lieve black is white, and-well, in a financiall point of view; lie&#xD;
is said to be a regular Jeremy Didler. He goes on change,&#xD;
and he gets into society somewhere or other, and no English-&#xD;
man of any account comes to this town but what Mr. O'Doeniall&#xD;
gets into his good graces. Why, man, I don't believe but what&#xD;
he owes every hotel in town except the one where he resides.&#xD;
He comes to our office occasionally, but I don't like hiig."&#xD;
Mr. Bennett smiled and 'observed, "He seems to be making&#xD;
himself very agreeable to Mrs. Parker."&#xD;
"He make himself agreeable! Why, sir, he has already ex-&#xD;
pliined to her all about our Savior's tomb at Jerusalem, and&#xD;
promised her a fragment of the 'rock which covered our Sa-&#xD;
vior' s sepulchre, which he has at his hotel, and which 'he got&#xD;
from a monk when he was last in Holy Land. I'll bet two to&#xD;
one that she has already invited him to call to morrow with it&#xD;
at her residence," said Wilson.&#xD;
"Doyou suppose he has a piece of the rock ?"&#xD;
'Rock be hanged. No; doubtful if he was ever nearer Je-&#xD;
rusalem than I have been. As for the rock, he will smash a&#xD;
piece off the curb-stone as he goes up to her house, and take it&#xD;
along with him. He is a bad customer, in a financial point of&#xD;
view, and if he once gets a foothold in the house of Mrs. PAr-&#xD;
ker, she will never get him out," said honest Wilson.&#xD;
Mr. Bennett queried out of the book-keeper the- name and&#xD;
occupationdof nearly every person in that room, and then they&#xD;
left it together to join the dancers, who were busily' occag~iod&#xD;

on the floor above. They had. hardly procured seats before&#xD;
Mr. Bennett was much struck by the appearance of an elderly&#xD;
person who was watching the dancers. He asked Wilson who&#xD;
that was.&#xD;
"Old Grasper, the millionaire," was the reply.&#xD;
In those days, thirty years ago,.raillionaires were very few&#xD;
and far between in the city of New York. Now they are as&#xD;
plenty as pickpockets in a great assemblage. Old John Gras.&#xD;
per was considered about as rich as any other man, with one,&#xD;
or perhaps two exceptions. Astor could set several numerals&#xD;
to the word millions. Old Nat Prime, of the firm of Prime,&#xD;
Ward &amp;amp; King, was getting up rapidly towards a million, and&#xD;
would have overreached it by the rise of city property had he&#xD;
not died suddenly. , Then there was Stephen Whitney, who,&#xD;
was running up on the hundreds of thousands,. but did not&#xD;
touch "million."  Thirty years ago Bobby Lennox, who made&#xD;
his first property while a clerk to the Commissioners of the&#xD;
British prison ships, could count up to three or four hundred&#xD;
thousand, aind John Grasper was not far behind the richest of&#xD;
them (save Astor) in those days. He had recently built him a&#xD;
house out of town of granite, and people wondered at. sich ex-&#xD;
travagance and folly as to put up so costly a building way up&#xD;
B roadway, above Prince street.  But old John finished it,&#xD;
and in spite of opposition moved into it from his brick house&#xD;
on thenorth-east corner, where the Astor House now stands,&#xD;
and took a position as one of the aristocratic families in New&#xD;
Yorg. He had two children-one a boy and the other a girl,&#xD;
or rather, these children were a young man named Franeis,&#xD;
who sported his inoney around town as one of the exclusives,&#xD;
and a fair girl named Irene, who, with her pecuniary prospects&#xD;
so flattering, was acknowledged as one of the elite and most&#xD;
fashionable young ladies about town. Old Grasper had other&#xD;
children, but they have no connection with this story, and need&#xD;
not to be alluded to.. Mr. Grasper was a man of strict business&#xD;
habits. He had acquired property in the fur trade, and he&#xD;
judiciously invested it in real estate and bank sfock. After&#xD;
he retired frontactive commercial life he was elected. presi-&#xD;
dedt of a city bank. The position was a respectable one, and&#xD;
the incine from this office was well worth having by even one&#xD;
of the richest citizens.&#xD;
On the present occasion old Mr. Grasper was watching every&#xD;
movement'of his daughter Irene, who was dancing with Colo-.&#xD;
nel Mac Neil. His eyes scarce wandered for a moment from&#xD;
them. Mr. Bennett and Wilson took seats near him. .&#xD;
&#xD;
"So that is old~Grasper, who is so rich-the millionaire, as&#xD;
you say, Mr Wilson," said Mr. Bennett.&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Bennett, and judging by the way he is watching&#xD;
the attentions of Colonel Mac Neil to his child, I should think&#xD;
something ,was broke. lie evidently don't like Colonel NMac&#xD;
Neil's sweet demonstrations upon his daughter-it is bad in a&#xD;
financial point of view; for my own opinion of Colonel Mac is&#xD;
that he is not Worth a cent."&#xD;
"le may be a good man, for all that. Scotch-is he not ?'&#xD;
replied Mr. Bennet'.&#xD;
"Yes sir. He might be a good man, but he is not, in. a&#xD;
financial or any other point of view. He is a very immoral&#xD;
man. But you are Scotch too, are you not ?" asked Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
"1 certainly was born in\Scotland, and lived there until I&#xD;
was sixteen, when I came to this country, and have been here&#xD;
ever since. I am from a different partof Scotland than where&#xD;
this Mac Neil's race lived. My family were Catholic Scotch,&#xD;
and believed 'in the Divine rights of the Stuarts down to&#xD;
this day. My mother was as strongly in favor of the Stuart&#xD;
dynasty as were her ancestors before her, although years had&#xD;
passed since there was the remotest hope of any of that royal&#xD;
race ever reigning again in Great Britain. But tell me more&#xD;
about this Colonel Mac Neil. You say that he is immoral.&#xD;
How so?   Gambles, I suppose ?" asked Mr Bennett.&#xD;
"Worse than that. He seduced in Canada a virtuous young&#xD;
lady named Jane McPherson. She was a soldier's daughter.&#xD;
I have seen the poor old father, McPherson. He came down&#xD;
to New York to try and persuade his child to return home.&#xD;
But no---she would not do it. She loves Mac Neil too well.&#xD;
She lives very retired as his mistress, and has fwo children by&#xD;
the Colonel. Poor thing! She hopes some day that Mac Neil&#xD;
will make an hoiiest.womai of her by marriage. Thee is no&#xD;
hope of that-the Colonel must marry for money, and he will&#xD;
do it too, if he can."&#xD;
While this conversation was being carried on, the object of,&#xD;
'al  it was deeply engrossed with Miss Irene Grasper. Tley had&#xD;
2   finished dancing, and Col. Mac Neil conducted his fair partner&#xD;
to one of the side rooms. Theywere alone. Irene Grasper&#xD;
was a magnficent girl, stately in appearance, with a profusion&#xD;
7    of light auburn locks arranged with great taste. Her cheeks&#xD;
~ were pale-her eyes a mild blue. When she was seated where&#xD;
few were likely to interrupt them, Mac Neil took one hand if&#xD;
his own, and in deep impassioned tones observed,&#xD;
"You know, dear Irene, how devotedly-hiow madly I have&#xD;

Toved you. To-night I nust know from your own lips my fate.&#xD;
You must have perceived how closely your father watched&#xD;
every motion while we were dancing. Do you love me, Irene?1&#xD;
"0 Colonel, how can you ask nie such a question!  You&#xD;
know that I do. How could I help it, although I have tried to&#xD;
do so," replied the lady.&#xD;
"Tried to help loving me, Irene?  What do you mean by&#xD;
that sentence? Why do you wish not to loye me i" asked&#xD;
Colonel Mac Neil.&#xD;
"I do-God knows I do. 0 Colonel, there are so many&#xD;
stories told about you-so many lies, perhaps scandal-.--and&#xD;
yet I am afraid almost to - dream of trusting my happiness in&#xD;
your keeping."&#xD;
"1Do you confess that you love me, Irene ?" asked Col. Mac&#xD;
Neil.&#xD;
"I do," replied the fair girl,-her eyes swimming in tears.&#xD;
"And will you. authorize me to make that statement to your&#xD;
father, when I ask him for your hand, which I will do to-&#xD;
night ?" said the Colonel.&#xD;
"0, do-not! He will not give his consent, and I shall be&#xD;
more miserable than ever," said Irene.&#xD;
"That, dear Irene, we shall see. There can be no great&#xD;
harm in my asking. I owe it to myself--to my own self-re-&#xD;
spect. Why should he not give his consent?  I am his equal,&#xD;
except perhaps in point of wealth, and of that he may hive&#xD;
more than I."&#xD;
What reply the young lady might have made is not so cer-&#xD;
tain, for just at that moment Mr. Grasper the millionaire made&#xD;
his appearance upon the scene. Colonel Mac Neil arose.&#xD;
"1Be seated, sir ; and you, Miss Irene, go and join your mo-&#xD;
ther. I would like to say a few words to you, sir," observed&#xD;
Mr. Grasper.&#xD;
Colonel Mac Neil rose and bowed to Miss Irene as she left&#xD;
the room, and then re-seated himself.&#xD;
"I am waiting patiently to hear the words you mentioned&#xD;
that you wished to address to me," said Colonel Mae Neil.&#xD;
"Colonel Mac Neil, you have been very pointed in your&#xD;
attentions to my daughter of late, and especially to-night.. I&#xD;
am a plain man, sir, and should. like to ask you what are'your&#xD;
intentions towards her ?" demanded old Mr. Grasper.&#xD;
"Honorable, of course, sir. I would like to see that person&#xD;
who dared say or hint otherwise !" said Col. Mac Neil.&#xD;
"0O-ah-.-yes. That is all very well, sir. Honorable-&#xD;
that means marriage, That is just what I don't want. I had&#xD;
&#xD;
just as lief your intentions were what you would call dis-&#xD;
honorable. It would suit me as well," sternly observed Mr.&#xD;
Grasper.&#xD;
"Mr. Grasper, I thank you for opening the way to a propo-&#xD;
sal I have to make. I love your daughter. You need not sneer,&#xD;
sir. I love her for herself alone. You, may think I seek her&#xD;
hand in honorable marriage because she is the daughter of a&#xD;
wealthy man. It is false, sir  I care not for her money. She&#xD;
loves me, sir, and will confess it with her own lips, if you, will&#xD;
ask her," said the Colonel.&#xD;
" Shan't do anything of the kind. I will not consent to your&#xD;
marrying her under any circumstances. If you take her, God&#xD;
curse me if I ever give her, directly or indirectly, dead or alive,&#xD;
a solitary cent to keep her or you from starving. Do I speak&#xD;
plain ?" sternly observed Mr. 4rasper.&#xD;
"Perfectly; but really, Mr. Grasper,. some explanation is&#xD;
necessary. I have a good business. I can support my wife.&#xD;
My position in society is equal to yours. By birth, I am at&#xD;
least your equal. Pray, Mr. Grasper, give me some reason for&#xD;
so extraordinary a refusal to my proposition. I am no beggar !"&#xD;
"Do you wish me to give you the reason--my real reason?"&#xD;
asked Mr. Grasper.&#xD;
"I do, most respectfully," replied Colonel:Mac Neil.&#xD;
"And, Mr. Ma Neil, if I do, and if it is satisfactory, will.&#xD;
you promise me, as a man of honor, that you will go to my&#xD;
daughter, and say to her that you relinquish her affections, and&#xD;
all claim to her hand ?" asked .Mr. Grasper.&#xD;
" I will, upon my honor. And now let me hear, if you please,&#xD;
the reason," said the Colonel.&#xD;
"Colonel Mac Neil, you may be -doing a good business-&#xD;
you may be making money-I care not. I do not believe you&#xD;
or any other man is doing a business sufficient to justify him&#xD;
in attempting to support twofamilies."&#xD;
Colonel Mac Neil was for a moment paralyzed. He was not&#xD;
prepared for this. "Stop one moment, sir-I am satisfied."&#xD;
Mr. Grasper passed out of the room.&#xD;
" What a fool I have been ! Who in the fiend's name could&#xD;
have told him that I kept a mistress, and had two children by&#xD;
her ? That is what he meant. Well, I am as proud as he is&#xD;
aA moment after he joined Miss Grasjger, and addressed her&#xD;
as easily as though nothing had happened. Ere he left her&#xD;
side, he said,&#xD;
"Irene, we meet hereafter as strangers. Your father has&#xD;
refused me your hand. I lam satisfied, and shall never' caim&#xD;

of Mrs: Nordheim, and left the house.&#xD;
Mr. Bennett had noticed some of these- proceedings, and&#xD;
when Colonel Mac -Neil took his hasty departure, he gently&#xD;
nudged Mr. Wilson, remarking, "My Scotch friend, the Col-&#xD;
onel, seems to have had a rebuff from some quarter.".&#xD;
"Indeed he has. I overheard a few high words between&#xD;
him and old Grasper  short time ago, and I think the Colonel&#xD;
will haul off in that quarter."&#xD;
He communicated to Mr. Bennett the "two families to sup-&#xD;
port " remark. The latter laughed, and said he had not thought&#xD;
Mr. Grasper had so much keen wit in his composition.&#xD;
"It was not bad, was-it ?" said Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
Marion Monck was not idle for a moment. He introduced&#xD;
such people to each other as he thought would make agreeable&#xD;
acquaintances. Such of his friends as were bashful, he led up&#xD;
to, the prettiest girls, and made them select partners for the&#xD;
dance. At last he approached Mr. Bennett.&#xD;
"Come, come, sir, this will not do. Why, you are destroy-&#xD;
ing Mr. Wilson's usefulnesss, and it don't pay in a pecuniary&#xD;
point of view-eh, Mr. Wilson?  What can you two have to&#xD;
say to each other of so much interest? Mr. Wilson, you must&#xD;
take down Mrs. Nordheim to supper to-night, and as to Mr.&#xD;
Bennett, I must trust him to take charge of my sweet Isabella&#xD;
Granville.  Consider yourselves engaged, both Monsieurs,&#xD;
when the proper time comes," and he passed on and joined&#xD;
Mrs. Woodruff, who was seated ,alone..&#xD;
" That Marion Monck is a noble fellow, Mr. Bennett. What&#xD;
do you think of him?  You have known him some time, he&#xD;
informs me."&#xD;
"For some months. He came up to the editorial rooms of&#xD;
the Courier to see Colonel Webb one day, and I then had a&#xD;
short conversation with him. I have since met him at my&#xD;
boarding-house," was Mr. Bennett's reply.&#xD;
"He will make a great merchant one of these days, I am&#xD;
thinking," added Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
. I have my doubts about that. I do not think lie will make&#xD;
a great merchant, nor a small one, either. He has talent of a&#xD;
higlrorder, and fitted for a higher sphere, or I am much mis-&#xD;
taken," observed Mr. Bennett.&#xD;
"Higher sphere !" repeated the indignant Wilson; "what&#xD;
higher sphere is there in New York, I should like to know ?"&#xD;
"'I don't wish to be rude, but I think to be an editor re-&#xD;

Time proved it, for what that editor prophesied became true&#xD;
in after years to a far greater extent than even he dreamed of&#xD;
at that early period.&#xD;
Marion was deeply engaged in conversation with Mrs. Wood-&#xD;
ruff. She seemed grateful for his attention. "I feel almost&#xD;
isolated here to-night, knowing so few, in fact none except the&#xD;
inmates of this house, by seeing you pass in and out of the&#xD;
doors," was her remark.&#xD;
"Yoa have resided next door to us over a- year, have you&#xD;
not ? I have always admired that house-it is at least one-&#xD;
third deeper than our house, and the yard is larger, and very&#xD;
beautifully arranged with trees, plants and flowers. You must,&#xD;
be fond of flowers, madam ?"&#xD;
"Very, indeed. I love them. My husband has been dead&#xD;
some years, and but for my pets, and my flowers, I should not&#xD;
know what to do," replied Mrs. Woodruff.&#xD;
"Have you no relatives living with you ?" asked Marion&#xD;
"Not one. . have done with them, and they with me. Not&#xD;
a soul lives with me except my servants and my live stock. I&#xD;
have many acquaintances who call upon me, but they are of&#xD;
the highest character. Mr. "Monck, I shall be most happy to&#xD;
have you call and see me whenever it is convenient. 1 am&#xD;
rarely out. If I have company, it need not discompose you.&#xD;
I shall have a parlor for you, no matter how many may be in&#xD;
the house. I never show one of my visitors into ihe same&#xD;
parlor where there is another," remarked Mrs. Woodruff,&#xD;
proudly.&#xD;
Marion thought this was a queer sort of woman; but as she&#xD;
was rich, she had a right to- be as eccentric as she pleased.&#xD;
He answered, that he should avail himself of her kind invitation.&#xD;
One word more. When you wish to ride, I have a car-&#xD;
iage and servants at your disposal. My stable and -carriage-&#xD;
house are in the rear of my house in Bond street. I hope yoa&#xD;
go to church, -was the word more of Mrs. W.&#xD;
Occasionally," replied Marion.&#xD;
"You ought to go every Sunday., Religion is an e'ellent&#xD;
thing for a young man or woman. It keeps the minds of both&#xD;
occupied and out of mischief. Will 'you go to church with rie&#xD;

"I own a pow in Grace Church, down Broadway, corner of&#xD;

" Nothing will give me more pleasure. Perhaps Mrs. Nord-&#xD;

I shall be happy to have you go. ' You will be obliged to re-&#xD;

to partake of the Lord's Supper. Who is that gentleman con-.&#xD;
versing with Mrs. Thomas Granville ?" said Mrs. Woodruff.&#xD;
"That? Why, that is the Count Falsechinski."&#xD;
"Tell me all about him. I am anxious to know his history."&#xD;
Marion complied with her request, and told her all he knew&#xD;
of the Count, except one or two matters that he had no right&#xD;
to tell.&#xD;
"Thank you; thank you. Now will you do me one favor&#xD;
more ? Bring the Count here and introduce him to me."'&#xD;
Marion stepped across the room, and, after talking a few&#xD;
moments to the eager Count, telling him about the rich lady&#xD;
next door, and so forth, he took his arm and brought him over.&#xD;
" Madam Woodruff, allow me to present to you my noble friend&#xD;
the Count Falsechinski. I will leave him with you."&#xD;
The C4unt became almost excruciatingly polite. He bowed&#xD;
almost to his knees, and placed one hand on his heart while he&#xD;
declared that he was perfectly overwhelmed with bliss at be-&#xD;
coming acquainted with so perfect a lady-that she reminded&#xD;
him of his sister (he was-too polite to say mother,) the Princess&#xD;
Sophinski, the most beautiful woman in Warsaw before the re-&#xD;
cent revolution. All the extra touches were put on by the&#xD;
Counts&#xD;
"No more. No more, .Count. I cannot bear it. There-&#xD;
stop and sit right down, or you will hurt yourself." The Count&#xD;
took a seat by her side. "There, that"is right. You are a'&#xD;
dear good Count, and we shall like each other much, when we&#xD;
are better acquainted."&#xD;
What passed after that between the two last-named persons&#xD;
it is not necessary to recount. Suffice it to say here, that Mrs.&#xD;
Woodruff showed the same anxiety about the piety of, the&#xD;
Count, and repeated the same invitation she had given to&#xD;
Marion. She also spoke of remaining to the sacrament, and&#xD;
the Count said he could not possibly permit that, unless he&#xD;
also remained with her,&#xD;

"But do you wish to partake of the sacrament, Count ?"&#xD;
she asked earnestly.&#xD;
"Nothing, I assure my dear madam, would, give me more&#xD;
pleasure. Rather than part with.your dear company, I would&#xD;
partake of any thing."&#xD;
Here supper was announced, and the Count offered his arm&#xD;
and escort. The other quests were suitably arranged, and be-&#xD;
fore ten o'clock all were at the supper-table, and ere midnight&#xD;
the regular occupants of thd house were left in it alone.&#xD;

" Tom," said Clara, "I wish to see the Count alone this&#xD;
morning-so be so obliging and take yourself somewhere else.&#xD;
Money you cannot get from me toIday, nor to-morrow,,.either-&#xD;
it would do you no good. Go to your brother."&#xD;
"But you have money of mine in "-commenced poor Tom.&#xD;
"Stop-no more of that, or I will forbid you the house. I&#xD;
do not owe you a dollar. You put some in my hands, but you&#xD;
have drawn it ,all," said Clara.&#xD;
"Surely I have not had "-again commenced Tom.&#xD;
"Never mind whether you have had it or not. I don'tkeep&#xD;
accounts. I have not got any of it, and if you have not spent&#xD;
it, I have, so there is no more to be said about it. Now go,&#xD;
that is a good boy," and she iose and gently pushed him out&#xD;
of the room and locked the door. " Now, Count, I have got&#xD;
rid of that poor foolish youth, I wish to talk with you.. You&#xD;
are a man. I understand you perfectly,. and I tell you can.&#xD;
didly, I admire you very much.. Hawks must not pick out&#xD;
hawks'  eyes. So you were at the party at Mrs. Nordheim's?&#xD;
Never  say a word until I finish. , Mr. Nordheim was all atten-&#xD;
tion to Mrs. Tom Granville. Don't shake your head. I know&#xD;
better. But what do I care ? As long as he allows. me what&#xD;
I need, and pays me regularly, he may do what else he pleases,&#xD;

but let the funds stop hut a day, an hour, ay, a quarter of a&#xD;
moment, and Mr. Nordheim and me part company forever. Tell&#xD;
me all that you know about Mrs. Woodruff."&#xD;
This was a subject upon which the Count willingly en-&#xD;
larged, and he gave a glowing description of the 'ricl widow,&#xD;
her splendid mansion, coach, servants in livery, and pew  in&#xD;
Grace Church.&#xD;
"Did Mr. Nordheim speak to her when she was at the party&#xD;
of his wife ?" asked Miss Norris.&#xD;
"I don't think he did. No: I am sure he did not."&#xD;
"The arch hypocrite! Did~Mrs. Woodruff become person.&#xD;
ally acquainted with other persons at the party beside you and&#xD;
my friend Marion ?" asked Miss Norris.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, to be sure; with many," replied the Count.&#xD;
Name them, every one, male and female," said Clara.&#xD;
"She talked with Miss Irene Grasper, with Mrs.. Parker,&#xD;
and her niece, Miss Julia, -and she was also introduced to Mr.,&#xD;
Doemall, an Irish gentleman. Some say lie is a peer," re-&#xD;
plied the Count.V&#xD;
"Are those all ?" demanded Miss Norris.&#xD;
"Upon my honor, Mademoiselle Norris, I think those I have&#xD;
named are all," was the Count's reply.'&#xD;
"Cout, I like you. I wish you to steer clear of the break-&#xD;
ers.  May I confide to you a secret for your own good, not&#xD;
mine ?" asked Miss Norris.&#xD;
"You may," replied the Count.&#xD;
"You say Nordheim did not appear to know that woman;.&#xD;
He lied by his actions, and is worse than I dreamed him to be,&#xD;
to introduce her to his home," said Clara.&#xD;
" He did not invite her there.  It was done without the&#xD;
knowledge of 1Ir. Nordheim. I kn6 that to be a fact. I had&#xD;
it from Marion, and he will not lie."&#xD;
- " That is true, and Nordheim is not quite so black as I&#xD;
thought him to be. Count, listen to me, but never repeat it.&#xD;
Use the knowledge for your own purposes, but do not use-it to&#xD;
save others. Count, you know that I was bought by Nordheim&#xD;
and brought to the city. You do not know, but now Iwill tell&#xD;
you, the first week that I spent in1 New York, before this house&#xD;
was ready-for me, I spent in that luxurious mansion now, as&#xD;
then, occupied by Mrs. Woodruff."&#xD;
The Count did not trust, himself to speak for several mo-&#xD;
ments. His eyes were busily engaged upon the rich flowers&#xD;
of the tapestry carpet that covered the floor.&#xD;

"That carpet cost four dollars a yard,. Count.  You need&#xD;
not examine its texture more closely."&#xD;
The Count smiled.&#xD;
"Mademoiselle, I am too astoufided to. say any thing. What&#xD;
a game my lady Woodruff must be playing ?"&#xD;
"She is a fearful-a terrible female, Count. It is real&#xD;
friendship for you that has made me open your eyes. She is&#xD;
the more to be dreaded because she moves in the very highest&#xD;
circles, and spreads devastation wholesale. Count, for some&#xD;
purpose you are saving money with all a miser's eagerness.&#xD;
Don't look so astonished. I know it. A little bird tells we'&#xD;
all that you do.  1, too, am saving money. For what purpose&#xD;
I know not, but this I do know, the power of money. I will&#xD;
never be poor again while there are gulls and pigeons to be&#xD;
plucked. Use the information I have given you. Show this&#xD;
pious lady that you at least know her, and make her pay-pay&#xD;
.-that's the word-if she uses you.    As you regard me,&#xD;
breathe not a word if you were to see your best friend's wife&#xD;
going into those double hall doors in Bond street," said Clara.&#xD;
"I thank you, Mademoiselle Clara, a million of times.  I&#xD;
will make that lady pay before she has done with me. You&#xD;
shall see what you shall see before the play is over. Now for&#xD;
the German lesson. You will need but three or four more,&#xD;
and then you will speak English, French, Spanish and Ger-&#xD;
man. The next shall be the Italian, eh ?"&#xD;
Yes, Count. Italian next. Answer me one question. Tell&#xD;
me what you think of the intrigue between Mr. Nordheim and&#xD;
Mrs. Tom Granville. Tell me honestly and truly.  You are a&#xD;
man of the world. Will that lady succumb to the infamous&#xD;
man?&#xD;
&#xD;
"No. Upon my soul. She is too clever-too spirituelle.&#xD;
He pays her money-largely, too. I know that. Five hundred&#xD;
-one thousand. But-she takes it-is civil-goes with him&#xD;
all about, but, lady-that Mrs. Granville loves her husBand.&#xD;
It is true, and she is honest."&#xD;
A precious pup for a sensible man to love, and yet, poor&#xD;
Tom,lhe is a delightful, harmless fellow. I do not think Tom&#xD;
would hurt a chicken. No; not a fly. But he does notknow&#xD;
the value of money. I gave him fifty dollars one morning last&#xD;
week, and what do you think, he did that' evening? Came to&#xD;
me for more. It is true, and when I asked what on earth he&#xD;
had done with it, he pulled from it a note of that precious-&#xD;
scamp Cedar's for sixty dollars, and told me had made' ten&#xD;
dollars by cashing it," said Clara.&#xD;

"Mr. Cedar's note is not, then,. worth much ?" asked the&#xD;

" Not worth so much as the paper was before he wrote his&#xD;

served Miss Norris.&#xD;
"II will take care of him, and thank you, too, for had you not&#xD;
told me this,1 should have given him two hundred dollars for&#xD;
his draft upon his publishers for two hundred and fifty," said&#xD;
the Count.&#xD;
And you would have lost every cent. I don't think his&#xD;
publishers owe him a penny. Yet that manI would challenge&#xD;
you if you dared insinuate that he was any thing but an lion-&#xD;
orable man. Count, is not this a very queer world ?' sarcas-&#xD;
tically observed Miss Norris.&#xD;
"The people in it are very queer-a very curious people.&#xD;
Mademoiselle, tell me about Doctor Carnochan."&#xD;
"1He is a young man of decided tradent:. and he, will one day&#xD;
rise to the very head of his profession, if he lives.. le has it&#xD;
in him. At present he is, from the force of circumstances, a&#xD;
wild, dissipated, useless man, and his companions are of the&#xD;
most worthless class.  Does he want money of you, too'&#xD;
Count ?" asked Miss Norris.&#xD;
"No. But it may be in my power to throw some practice in&#xD;
his,.way," kindly added the Count.&#xD;
Do so if you  edan,  Coun He will earn more than the&#xD;
usual fee as compared with other doctors. Tell me how Ma.&#xD;
rion Monck gets on with his languages," aske4 the lady.&#xD;
" He has already mastered several of the most difficult. His&#xD;
parents were Dutch, so that it came natural to him to acquire&#xD;
the German, which is a sort of first cousin to low Dutch."&#xD;
"What is the difference between German and low.Dutch ?"&#xD;
asked Clara.&#xD;
The German, or Hoch Deutsch, is spoken all through Ger-&#xD;
many. The Neder Deutch, or Low Dutch, is the language of&#xD;
the Hollinders, or the Nederlanders, which, in English, is low-&#xD;
landers, in contradistinction to the Hoch Deutsch or high Ger-&#xD;
mans--.or rather high-land Dutchmen. Now shall we proceed&#xD;
with your German lesson?&#xD;
"With pleasure, Count," was her reply.&#xD;
An hour afterward the Count sent a note from the office to&#xD;

two Children-A Breakfast Scene with Willy and Patsy-The Colonel set-&#xD;
tiles a House on his Children, and places two thousand dollars in the Saving.&#xD;
Bank for them--Redeeming traits in a Fashionable Bad Man's character.&#xD;
SUCH of our readers as are familiar with New York, will re-&#xD;
member a street in the lower part of the town, running from&#xD;
ludson street to the North river, named Harrisor, street. As&#xD;
it was kuown a hundred years ago by the same name, it could&#xD;
not have been named after our General Harrison, or more re-&#xD;
cently President Harrison, but must have honored some Eng-&#xD;
lish family. Be this as it may, in this same street, at No. 27,&#xD;
the first door from  Greenwich street, stands or. did' stand a&#xD;
small two story brick house. It rented for three hundred dol-&#xD;
lars a year, and was occupied by two fainilies. 'The lower part,&#xD;
save a back kitchen, was rented by a worthy butcher and his&#xD;
small fatnily, while the upper or second story was occupied by&#xD;
a lady and her two children, one a boy about five years of age,&#xD;
that his mother called William, and a little girl three years&#xD;
old, with the pretty cognomen of Patsy. The front room of the&#xD;
second story was plainly but comfortably furnished as a parlor.&#xD;
The rear room contained a bed, and between the two rooms&#xD;
was a third small:room in which was placed' a trundle bed for&#xD;
the children. It was a cold December morning, only a week&#xD;
after the party at Mrs. Nordheim's house in Bond street, when&#xD;
the bell rang at No. 27. The mother of the two children had&#xD;
just placed their and her simple breakfast upon the table in the&#xD;
small back kitchen in the basement, where she had a cooking&#xD;
stove and a pantry. ' This also was a portion of her part of the&#xD;
house, for which she paid an annual rent of one hundred and&#xD;
twenty dollars. The hell rang a second time.&#xD;
"Go to the door, Willie ; who knows bat it is  our   a 1&#xD;
It sounds like his ring.&#xD;
The little boy was off like a rocket, and in a moment 'after-'&#xD;
ward a heavy footstep was heard descending the kitchen stairs.&#xD;
He entered the room with the boy in his arms, and placed him&#xD;
on his feet; and then the'lady flung herself in the gentleman'a&#xD;

arms, uttering but one word, "William,!" He gently displaced&#xD;
the lady, and then took up the little girl, and kissed her fondly.&#xD;
"I am just in time for breakfast, Jane, eh ?" and he took a&#xD;
seat.&#xD;
0 William, if we had but known you were coming-we&#xD;
bve not a breakfast fit for you to eat," observed Jane.&#xD;
"Don't you and the children eat that breakfast ? and if so,&#xD;
is itnot good enough for me ?" asked Col. Mac Neil.&#xD;
" Don't be. angry with me, William-I did not mean any&#xD;
thing. But you, who are so used to living at hotels, could&#xD;
hardly expect to enjoy such a breakfast as this. But why have&#xD;
you'kep away so long ?" she asked.'&#xD;
"Business, Jane. Business, pleasure, every thing. But&#xD;
now let us have a nice breakfast. Here is money-send out&#xD;
and get any thing nice that you can find," observed the Colonel.&#xD;
"I wi lgo myself, if you will mind the children while I am&#xD;
gone, Colonel," she replied.&#xD;
" That I will do with pleasure ;" and he took a child upon&#xD;
each knee, and kissed, caressed and played alternately with&#xD;
them until the mother returned. It was not long before the&#xD;
good mother had a very choice breakfast smoking on the table,&#xD;
and'all partook of it, while the father, for so he was, of those&#xD;
two children exerted himself to the utmost to make a pleasant&#xD;
time of it. An hour elapsed-before the happy family had fin-&#xD;
ished the' meal. Then the gentleman, who was n3o other than&#xD;
Colonel William Mac Neil, asked if there was a fire up stairs.&#xD;
Receiving a reply in the affirmative,. he continued: "Jane,&#xD;
send Willy and Patsy pp stairs-we will follow presently ; but&#xD;
I have a few 'words to say to you alone."&#xD;
The children went up stairs, little Willy leading by the&#xD;
hand the tottersome Patsy. When they were.gone, the Colonel&#xD;
drew out a segar from a rich shagreen segar case, and delibe-&#xD;
rately lit it.&#xD;
" Come and sit down by me, Jane."&#xD;
She complied' in silence, her looks expressing wonder as to&#xD;
what was to come next.&#xD;
"Jane, I idolize those children. I wish to God you were&#xD;
niy legal wife, for you are, a true-hearted, loving woman. Don't&#xD;
cry, darling, but listen to me. You think I could easily legaf-&#xD;
ize them, and marry you. No, no-that is' a dream; it i too&#xD;
late-my cursed pride will notlet me do it. That is not all;&#xD;
I must marry a woman who has money, or be a disgraced bank-&#xD;

or be dependent even upon me. I am a rascal, Jane, so far as&#xD;
you are concerned : I know it-I feel it. But, thank God, I&#xD;
have placed you and those dear ones so that you can never&#xD;
want. Are you listening ?" said the Colonel, with emotion.&#xD;
"Surely, Mac, I have not lost a word. Go on-I hope you&#xD;
have nothing worse to tell me," she observed.&#xD;
"Jane, I have saved up and withdrawn from my business&#xD;
seven thousand dollars, and with it I have purchased a house&#xD;
in Franklin street near Broadway. The lot is twenty-five feet&#xD;
by one hundred, and sixteen years hence, when Willy is of&#xD;
age, that property will be double or treble in value. I have&#xD;
deeded it to you, Jane McPherson, in trust for Willy and&#xD;
Patsy. The house is a good one, and now rents for six hun-&#xD;
dred and fifty dollars per annum, and has- a good tenant. That&#xD;
rent you must% draw and live on, in case I am unable to do any&#xD;
thing more for you. That is not all. Here is two thousand&#xD;
dollars that I won in gambling some time ago. It is but a par-&#xD;
tial return of ten times that amount that I have lost at gam-&#xD;
*     bling. It is yours-take it to a Savings Bank, and place it&#xD;
there at interest in your own or in Willy's name--your own&#xD;
is better, and then you will have two sources of income."&#xD;
The poor young mother was weeping.. "O.Mac.-dear Mae,&#xD;
why do you do this ? Are you going away'? Idon't- want it;&#xD;
you allow us all we want !" she exclaimed.&#xD;
"Listen, Jane. When I signed that deed, I had deter-&#xD;
mined to offer myself that night to a very Wealthy young lady.&#xD;
I expected to be accepted, and I then determined to act hon-&#xD;
orably by her; and to do so I intended -that deed as a pro-&#xD;
vision for you and my dear children, and then t bid you fare-&#xD;
well, and see you no more," said the Colonel.&#xD;
"0 Mac, could you'have the heart to do it ?  Could you&#xD;
part with those two little precious ones, and, never see them&#xD;
more? 0, it was a cruel thought !" said Jane.&#xD;
" Be calm-I am. I have not yet'done. I offered myself&#xD;
to the girl, and she accepted me. Don't start off in that man-&#xD;
ncr. Then I saw her father-one of the wealthiest men in the&#xD;
city. He refused to countenance the marriage, and what was&#xD;
still more, situated as I am, he swore before God that if his&#xD;
daughter married me, she should never receive a cent. He&#xD;
had heard of our affairs-of our children, Jane, and he said he&#xD;
did not think I could support two families. That was quite&#xD;
enough for me, Jane. The affair is at an end, and I shall pro-&#xD;
j4bably never marry."&#xD;

" Hear me out, Jane, and know the worst. I have secured&#xD;
you from want, and the deed is irrevocable ; but Heaven only&#xD;
knows how soon I may be a beggar. The affairs of my firm are&#xD;
in a terrible state. My partner. thinks that he can carry the&#xD;

advances upon the shipments. If those shipments turn out'&#xD;
well, we are safe, and shall keep afloat. If not-but I don't&#xD;
dare to think of it. This thought though consoles me-come&#xD;
what will, you and Willy and Patsy are provided for," contin-&#xD;
ued the Colonel feelingly.&#xD;
"But, dear Mac, if this would serve you, I will deed it back&#xD;
to you, and, you could sell it again, and also take the two thou-&#xD;
sand dollars," observed Jane.&#xD;
"You are an unselfish being, Jane-but no, no. It would&#xD;
not be a drop in the bucket. Do exactly as I have to d you,&#xD;
and I will continue to give you what funds you need, just as&#xD;
though the nine thousand dollar provision had not been made.&#xD;
If I am fortunate and get through my own difficulties, you will&#xD;
have the interest every year to add to the principal, and in a&#xD;
few years you will have quite a little sum. Now kiss me, and&#xD;
then let us go up stairs and join Willy and Patsy. After all&#xD;
there are some happy moments for the most miserable, and I&#xD;
will come and breakfast with you soon again," said the Colonel.&#xD;
" Dear Mac, it makes the children so happy."&#xD;
The haughty Colonel Mac Neil played and romped with his&#xD;
children untildinner was ready,'and then he dined with them&#xD;
Before evening he was again at his hotel.&#xD;
There are some redeeming traits in even the most worldly&#xD;

IN the year 183-, a company of persons who would be ex-&#xD;
tremely exclusive, determined to put up a building and open&#xD;
an Italian Opera House in this city. To carry out their de-&#xD;
sign, they purchased sufficient ground on the corner of Church&#xD;
and Leonard streets, and proceeded to put up a large and&#xD;
handsome building. When this Opera House was finished, an&#xD;
arrangement was made for a manager, and a regular stock&#xD;
Italian Opera Company was established in New York'city. It&#xD;
was a mixed-up sort of concern.  At -first it was a regular&#xD;
stock company. Then private boxes were disposed of to par-&#xD;
ticular families foi life, in order to raise money; and then&#xD;
commenced a system   of begging, borrowing, and voluntary&#xD;
contributions, until all hands became disgusted, and the build-&#xD;
ing passed from the opera people to 'the mortgagee, and he&#xD;
leased it for a regular theatre to James Wallack, who opened&#xD;
it under the title of the National Theatre.&#xD;
But to return to the Italian crowd.  The parties who got&#xD;
up the Italian opera were not the old Knickerbocker stock in-&#xD;
habitants. They were a parvenu population-people who had&#xD;
been successful as brokers, merchants, stock gamblers, real&#xD;
estate speculators, and other modes by which fortunes are'sud-&#xD;
denly accumulated in this great metropolis. Many of the&#xD;
parties had travelled in Europe to acquire business, and form&#xD;
commercial connexions.   They had visited Pa-is and London,&#xD;
and perceiving how aristocratic the Italian opera was in those&#xD;
cities, they considered that to become interested.in an Italian&#xD;
opera in New York would give* them an aristocratic position&#xD;
These were the motives that actuated most of the patrons of&#xD;

&#xD;
the early Italian opera in New York. It is needless to say&#xD;
that they paid dear for the Italian whistle, and it got broken&#xD;
in a very short period of time.&#xD;
Among those who took a very active part in the Italian ope-&#xD;
ra was Mr. Nordheim:  He spoke Italian fluently, and he was&#xD;
not only allowed to spend his money in the enterprise without&#xD;
stint, but he was also permitted to take a very active part in&#xD;
the details. The Finance Committee knew no more about Ita.&#xD;
lian than they did about Greek, and Mr. Nordheim translated&#xD;
between the false Italian Prince and Princess actors, and their&#xD;
Wall street financiers.&#xD;
The Italian opera opened during the month of the party at&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheim's, and Mr. Nordheim placed at his wife's dis-&#xD;
posal a private box, and she filled it almost every night with&#xD;
some of her-friends. She was generally attended thither by&#xD;
Mr. Wilson or Marion-sometimes by both.       The Count&#xD;
Falsechinski receivedtickets frequently for Miss Norris and&#xD;
himself, and occasionally Tom Granville made up a party for&#xD;
one of the front seats in the dress circle. It was April. The&#xD;
bill for that night was very attractive. Mrs. Nordheim was in&#xD;
her private box with a party. Marion Monek was there also.-&#xD;
and so was Isabella Granvile.  On the right side of the dress&#xD;
circle, Miss Norris, with the Count and Tom Granville, occu-&#xD;
pied three seats.&#xD;
Shortly after the curtain rose, Mr. Nordheim was seen to&#xD;
enter the dress circle by a door directly opposite the centre&#xD;
of the building. He took a seat on the third bench. Directly&#xD;
in front of him was -a gentleman accompanied by a lady of&#xD;
rare and surpassing beauty.  It was noticed by those in the&#xD;
neighborhood that Mr. Nordheim endeavored to attract the no.&#xD;
tice of the beautiful woman who occupied the seat directly in&#xD;
front of him. Once she turned her head almost around, and&#xD;
gazed at him with an expression that denoted the most violent&#xD;
anger, and then seemed absorbed with what was passing on&#xD;
.the stage.&#xD;
I may have omitted to mention that Mr. Nordheim was near-&#xD;
sighted, and wore gold spectacles.  He never was without&#xD;
them. Hundreds -who were present that eventful evening,&#xD;
well remember the fearful scream  of agony  which  rung&#xD;
through that Opera House, although the extent of the.tragedy&#xD;
in the dress circle was not dreamed of that night. Again that&#xD;
lady turned and looked indignantly at Mr. Nordheim, who&#xD;
saniled and partly bowed. It was noticed that the lady whis-&#xD;
pered to the gentleman with her. She quietly informed him&#xD;
&#xD;
that the person on the rear seat had put his hand upon her per-&#xD;
son in an improper manner.&#xD;
" Can you point him out to me distinctly ?" whispered. the&#xD;
brother.-for so he proved to be.&#xD;
"Yes, Frank, he is seated directly behind me, with his&#xD;
knees upon the seat where I am   sitting.  Frank, he has&#xD;
pinched me behind again !"&#xD;
"Keep perfectly quiet, Emily-don't move," and as he&#xD;
said this he rose to his feet, turned his back to the stage so as&#xD;
to face Nordheim, and rapidly drew back his arm, and with&#xD;
all his force struck his fist directly in Nordheim'sright eye.&#xD;
There was one terrific scream. The glass had broken, and the&#xD;
force of the blow had driven several of the particles into the&#xD;
right eye of the unfortunate Nordheim. There was an instant&#xD;
rush, and much confusion. The gentlemen remained perfectly&#xD;
calm and did not move an inch. Nordheim had fainted with&#xD;
the intense agony from the pierced eyeball. Shouts arose from&#xD;
the parterrev--" Turn him out !" The gallery re-echoed "Turn&#xD;
him out !"  Meanwhile Marion Monck, the Count, and' some&#xD;
others of the acquaintance of Mr. Nordheim; hurried to the&#xD;
spot, just as he had been carried out of the boxes.  They all&#xD;
saw at once the nature of the wound. Then the gentleman&#xD;
who had inflicted it came out and explained what had occurred&#xD;
--regretting that he had inflicted so terrible a punishment. A&#xD;
carriage was procured.  By this time Pitt Granville had&#xD;
learned what had occurred. "Take him at once to the New&#xD;
York Hospital," was .his peremptory order. Mr. Nordheim&#xD;
was with difficulty placed in the carriage. His agony was fear.&#xD;
fiul.&#xD;
"Go and tell Mrs. Nordheim what has happened, and- take&#xD;
her home, Marion. I will be up there as soon as Nordheim is&#xD;
better or worse.  The hospital is the only place, Tor he needs&#xD;
immediate surgical aid. Mr. Wilson, go with me."&#xD;
These sensible orders of Pitt Granville were rapidly carried&#xD;
into execution, and the carriage drove around to the hospital&#xD;
gate. Mr. Roberts, the Superintendent, was an old friend of&#xD;
Mr. Granville, and luckily happened to, be in the office. A&#xD;
proper room Was instantly arranged, and Mr. Nordheim was&#xD;
taken into it. Then the leading. surgeons were sent for. They&#xD;
tried to extract the broken pieces, of glass, but only partially&#xD;
succeeded. Mr. No'rdheim was a raving maniac..&#xD;
But I must carry back my readers to the Opera House.&#xD;
When Mrs. Nordheim had learned the particulars of the-acci-&#xD;
desnt, she refused to go home, but 'left, her party,. and o with&#xD;

&#xD;
Marion went directly to the hospital inner gate, where the&#xD;
little house of the gate-keeper is, and asked permission to go&#xD;
in and see her husband. She was refused-politely but posis&#xD;
tively-and she at once got into a carriage and went home to&#xD;
Bond street. .Soon after, a gentleman appeared at the gate,&#xD;
and asked permission to see one of the officers of -the hospital.&#xD;
He was shown inside to Mr. Roberts.               0&#xD;
"1Here is my card, sir. I am the person who struck the&#xD;
blow at the opera."&#xD;
Mr. Roberts took the card and read, "Francis Gaillard, at&#xD;
Mrs. Mann's, No. 85 Broadway."&#xD;
"1The accident, sir, I fear will terminate seriously, and I&#xD;
will use -this card, as you may be called upon to give some&#xD;
explanation. How did it happen ?" inquired Mr. Roberts.&#xD;
The stranger, whose name was Gaillard,. replied, " I am a&#xD;
South Carolinian, on a visit here with my mother and sister. I&#xD;
took my sister to the Italian opera this evening. After the&#xD;
performance had commenced, she told me that a person- on the&#xD;
seat behind her had insulted her, and I at once struck him."&#xD;
"Served the d     libertine right," was the only comment,&#xD;
made by the indignant but honest Mr. Roberts.&#xD;
"fI took my sister to Mrs. Mann's boarding-house, and&#xD;
came at once to give myself up in case of need.  Will it be&#xD;
liecessary for me to do any thing more9"&#xD;
.'No. Go home as though nothing, had happened.  If he&#xD;
dies to-night, or within a few days, a coroner's inquest will be&#xD;
held, and you willhave to be on band; but it is a disgraceful,&#xD;
affair, and unless Nordheim dies immediately it will be hushed&#xD;
up. Good night."&#xD;
"Thank you-good night," and the stranger Gaillard passed&#xD;
out of the hospital.&#xD;
The Count conveyed the horrified Clara Norris to Broome&#xD;
street, and then left her, promising to return as soon as he had&#xD;
paid a visit to the hospital. -iHe, too, was refused admission,&#xD;
but as he was passing out of the gate he was overtaken by Mr.&#xD;
Pitt Granville and Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
" Count, 'go at once to Mr. Nordheimi's, in Bond street, see&#xD;
Marion Monck, get the keys of the store, and come directly to&#xD;
the City Hotel."&#xD;
The Count went on his errand, and when Pitt Granvillevand&#xD;
his book-keeper were walking alone, the former said, abruptly,&#xD;
" Wilson, this sort of thing-has got to be stopped. I am tired&#xD;
of it. Such proceedings by one of the members of a mercan-.&#xD;
tile firm are ruinous."&#xD;
&#xD;
I think so, sir. It will be known on change to-morrow,&#xD;
.and even if Mr. Nordheim gets well, I den't see how he- can&#xD;
explain it."&#xD;
" Explain. 1 There is o explanation needed. I can put up&#xD;
with a great many things, but this is a beastly concern alto",&#xD;
gether. Come what will, I am not going to associate with 'him&#xD;
any more as a partner."&#xD;
"But how are you to end the partnership?   You have no&#xD;
right to "--asked Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
"I know what you mean; but right or wrong, you will see&#xD;
what course I shall pursue under the present painful circum-&#xD;
stances. Wait until I get into the office."&#xD;
They reached the City Hotel, and Mr. Granville ordered&#xD;
whiskey punch for himself and for Mr. Wilson. They finished&#xD;
the first glass, and then Mr. Granville ordered one more- for&#xD;
himself, as Mr. Wilson refused, and he requested him to go&#xD;
and find Colonel Benson, andimeet him at the office as speedily&#xD;
as possible. Soon after the Count and Marion joined him, and&#xD;
all proceeded to the counting-house in Broad street. It was&#xD;
opened. Then Colonel Benson..and Wilson arrived. Books&#xD;
were got out of the -safe, Accounts were examined. The con-&#xD;
sultation was held, and finally Mr..Granville came out of his&#xD;
private office with a paper in his hand.&#xD;
"Marion, I want you to make several copies of this. Take&#xD;
one to each of the following daily papers&#xD;
"The Daily Mercantile Advertiser.,&#xD;
Gazette,&#xD;
Courier and Enquirer,&#xD;
Journal of Commerce,&#xD;

Marion complied. The next morning the following could.&#xD;
have been read in either of the five moruing dailies:&#xD;
NLOTICE.-The co-partnership heretofore existing under the firm of, Granville &amp;amp;~&#xD;
Nordheim is this day dissolved. The liquidation of the affairs of the late firm&#xD;

"Have you put those advertisements in the morning pa.&#xD;
pers ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir. I was in time with all of them."&#xD;
"When you go home tell Mrs. Nordheim what I have found&#xD;
'it necessary to do, with promptness, to save the credit of this&#xD;
concern. She can appoint you or Mr. Wilson to act for her in-&#xD;

ful amount of money lately, and Mr. Wilson thinks his share&#xD;

his stock capital in the concern. We shall know in a few&#xD;

aThe Count Falsechinski, when he left the office, although' it&#xD;
was nearly midnght, went up to Broome street. He found&#xD;
Miss Norris waiting for hin. Tom Granville was there.&#xD;
"Nordheim will die, or be insane for life," said the Count.&#xD;
"Is that your opinion,' Count ?" asked Tom, who seemed&#xD;
pleased at the idea.&#xD;
"It is. 'The firm is dissolved by Mr. Granville, and notices&#xD;
to that effect will appear in all the daily papers to-morrow."&#xD;
" Then good-bye, Ferdinand Nordheim. You have been a&#xD;
source of good and a curse to me. Now I will fight my own&#xD;
battles and play my own game in life, for you are dead, so far&#xD;
as I am concerned in any event. Sh.all we make up a card&#xD;

Thank you. No. I must get home, for I have much to&#xD;
do to-morrow. Are you walking down town, Tom ?'&#xD;
" No; he is not going down town these two hours yet," spoke&#xD;
Clara.&#xD;
She showed the Count to the door, and then returned.,&#xD;
"This is a funny business, all round, ain't it, Clara ?" said&#xD;
Tom.&#xD;
"Tom Granville, answer me one question. You have stated&#xD;
to me that you believe your wife and Nordheim were engaged&#xD;
in a criminal intimacy. Answer me now, as God will be your&#xD;
Judge. Do you, in your inmost soul, believe that ?" demanded&#xD;
Clara.&#xD;
I do solemnly," replied the husband Tom.&#xD;
"Why do you not take steps to get a divorce from  your&#xD;
wife, then, if yoiu believe her gudity and faithless to your hon-&#xD;
'or .' asked Miss Norris'.'&#xD;
Never. I have lo'ved' that woman. Perhaps love her yet,&#xD;

VIGOR.                     135&#xD;
but I will never take any steps to get divorced from her," re.&#xD;
plied good-natured Tom Granville.&#xD;
" Suppose she, however, should try to get divorced from you.&#xD;
She could do it," said Miss Norris.&#xD;
"Let her do so. I will make no objection."&#xD;
"Tom, do you believe I have been true to my ,master--to&#xD;
Nordheim ?" asked Clara.&#xD;
"I do. I know I can speak for myself, Clara," said Tom.&#xD;
"Tom, it is true. I have been as faithful to that man as if&#xD;
I had been his wedded wife, but it is all over now. He is. no&#xD;
more to me than if he was dead. His money is gone, even if&#xD;
he lives. He has been fearfully extravagant. You say that&#xD;
you will never live with your wife again ?" said Clara.&#xD;
"Never," replied Tom Granvilled&#xD;
"Will you live here, Tom ?;and devote yourself, to my com-&#xD;
fort ? Go with me when I go out ? I need a protector. I&#xD;
will pay for one, but no nonsense with me..- No jealousy, or&#xD;
any thing of that sort. I will be as free as a bird, go and come&#xD;
when I please; see whom I please, dance, flirt, coquette, or&#xD;
play the fool with, whoni I please, and you are not-to open your&#xD;
lips. I like you, but I don't love you. You are amusing-a&#xD;
gentleman-:and you shall have the means to carry on the war&#xD;
as such. You don't keep me. I keep you. Do you agree to&#xD;
these conditions ? and have you force of character enough to&#xD;
stick to them ?" she asked.&#xD;
"I have, Clara," was the reply.&#xD;
"Very well. Our bargain is made, but mark me, the very&#xD;
first moment you deviate from our understanding, or show any&#xD;
jealousy, or any dislike to my being intimate with whom  I&#xD;
please, that moment we part. Now you may kiss me, and seal&#xD;
the bargain," she pleasantly remarked.&#xD;
Poor easy, good-natured Tom Granville. Little did you&#xD;
dream, whem completing this arrangement, that you'were sign-&#xD;
ing the death-warrant for your future hopes of earthly domes-&#xD;
tic happiness, and degrading yourself to the lowest of Mankind&#xD;
-the kept man of a- fancy woman !   Leaving these worldly&#xD;
ones, our reader will go with us to the hospital. Nordheim be-&#xD;
came worse and worse. The next lay his wife spent several&#xD;
hours by his bedside. He did not recognize her. Day after&#xD;
day she visited him,.until the inflammation, which had reached&#xD;
his brain, became so certain of ending fatally, that a lawyer,.&#xD;
Charles 8. Spencer, was employed' to remain with him. con-&#xD;
stantly, under the hope that he might become sane for ,afe&#xD;
inoments ere he died. Two weeks after the accident, his wife&#xD;

.called, and found him, for the first time, perfectly conscious of&#xD;
every thing around him. His partner was sent for. The law.&#xD;
yer asked the Physician Surgeon how long he might live.&#xD;
"Until evening."&#xD;
Then occurred a painful scene-a death-bed repentance. He'&#xD;
dictated a will. It was short. He left all to his wife. All-&#xD;
every thing. Except the furniture of the house in which&#xD;
Clara Norris lived, that he gave to her, and also five hundred&#xD;
dollars. He signed articles dissolving the firm, and authorizing&#xD;
his wife to close up the affairs as best suited herself, and he&#xD;
made Mr. Granville give a solemn promise that in case his half&#xD;
interest in the concern should not leave a respectable sum for&#xD;
his wife, that he would give her one-third interest in the future&#xD;
business, or take into partnership any one she should desi*g-&#xD;
nate. Frank Gaillard was sent for. When he reached the&#xD;
bed of the dying man he was much agitated, and expressed the&#xD;
deepest regret for what had occurred.&#xD;
$ Not a word more. You served me right. Tell your sis-&#xD;
ter that a dying man begs her forgiveness for the outrage he,&#xD;
committed."&#xD;
Mr.' Nordheim lingered on through the day, but just after&#xD;
sunset, when twilight was deepening into dark over the trees&#xD;
and around the old hospital windows, Nordheim sank into what&#xD;
appeared a gentle sleep. Mr. Granville first discovered that&#xD;
he was dead. Mrs. Nordheim pressed- her lips to the dead&#xD;
man, and was then led out of the room  --That night the coffin&#xD;
containing his body was conveyed to Bond street. The sue-,&#xD;
ceeding day it was transferred to a cemetery, and the trou-&#xD;
bles, the pleasures, the rascalities, and the redeeming qualities&#xD;
o the unfortunate Nordheim were over forever.&#xD;

BETWEEN Broadway and Broad street, running from Wall,&#xD;
to Beaver, is a little narrow street called the New street, al-&#xD;
though it is one of the oldest streets in the city. Thirty years&#xD;
ago it seemed to be used for no other purpose than for an alley&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR. &#xD;

&#xD;
to the two main streets of Broadway or Broad.  A  sort of&#xD;
sewer ran through it. Some of the houses on Broadway had&#xD;
stables in the rear, facing on New street. An occasional dwel-&#xD;
ling house occupied by French dry goods importers on Broad&#xD;
had a solid stone warehouse on New street. No. 20 New&#xD;
street was used as a building of that description. The walls&#xD;
were two feet thick, with small windows, closed by two straight&#xD;
iron bars and an-iron shutter. On this store was a large sign,&#xD;
" John O'Doemall, Wine Merchant."  There was an office in&#xD;
the rear on the first floor. In it was one desk. The floor&#xD;
contained eight, or perhaps ten gin pipes, whiskey puncheons,&#xD;
and a pile.of champagne baskets. All were empty. In the&#xD;
office was a plain table, and upon it was a couple of wine&#xD;
glasses, two glass tumblers, and some sample bottles.  Mr.&#xD;
O'Doemall is at his desk. He is seated in a cushioned arm-&#xD;
chair, with one leg cocked over the desk, and is engaged in&#xD;
reading the Courier and Enquirer.&#xD;
A customer enters. Mr. O'Doemall drops his leg and re-&#xD;
moves the paper from his face.&#xD;
"Oh, ab, my friend Marion lonck. Good morning. Real-&#xD;
ly, I am quite happy to see you.  Sit down.  Take a seat.&#xD;
Where is my clerk. Here, Thomas."&#xD;
But the aforesaid Thomas, the clerk, is an invisibility.&#xD;
"I have called,' Mr. O'Doemall, at the request of Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville, to obtain some sort -of a settlement with you.  Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim, unbeknown to his partner at the- time, sold you&#xD;
goods to the -extent of three hundred and four dollars and&#xD;
odd "-said young Mouck.&#xD;
"E~acai yoThree hundred and four dollars and seventy-two&#xD;
cents. I kiow  the precise amount. A mere trifle, which&#xD;
ought to have been paid long ago, but I overlooked it. Surely,&#xD;
Mr. Granville would not send you to collect so small an amount&#xD;
as that."&#xD;
"He did.so, and if it. is not convenient for you to pay the&#xD;
money, he would like to have you give your note, adding the&#xD;
interest for ninety days, or even four months."&#xD;
"I forgot to ask you' how Mrs. Nordheim 'is-poor lady-..-&#xD;
great misfortune. Nordheim was a good fellow. Queer. If&#xD;
Nordheim had lived, he would never have been so mean as to&#xD;
send for that pitiful sum. How do you know but what I have&#xD;
a receipt for it ? In fact, I don't think I can pay that "note.&#xD;
Nordheim owes me, let me see, three hundred dollars at John&#xD;
Florence's, twQ hundred and ten dollars one night in Broadway&#xD;

I must. look up some of Nordheim's 1 0 Us. ~,I dare say they&#xD;
are in one of my cast off vest pockets," replied the impudent&#xD;
O'Doemall.&#xD;
" If you have any receipts from 'Mr. Nordheim, or any claim&#xD;
against him-note-due bill, or positive evidence that Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim owed you a dollar, Mr. Granville will allow it,"&#xD;
said Monek.&#xD;
"Of course he will.  I knew he was an honorable man.  I&#xD;
have them. somewhere. That is a beautiful daughter of Gran.-&#xD;
ville's, Isabella. You are to mar-ry her, I suppose? Couldn't&#xD;
do better, and I shall tell my friend Granville so," said O'Do-&#xD;
ernall. -&#xD;
"Really, Mr. O'Doemall, I trust you will do nothing so fool-&#xD;
ish. I have no idea-that isI am not engaged to her, and "-&#xD;
said Monek, embarrassed.&#xD;
"I will speak to Gran about it. You are a first rate match&#xD;
for his daughter. She is pretty, and will have the thino, eh ?"&#xD;
said O'Doemall.&#xD;
".Really, Mr. O'Doemall, I cannot converse with you upon&#xD;
such a subject. I called to settle an account, If you, will&#xD;
not settle it, I will so say to Mr. Granville when I return 'to&#xD;
the store."&#xD;
"4Very well, sir. I could pay, I believe, twenty such ac-.&#xD;
counts, if I owed them. I believe W. Pitt Granville is good,&#xD;
and you can say to him that if he wants to borrow eight, or&#xD;
even as high as twelve thousand, I can let him have it at teni&#xD;
minutes' warning," said the audacious Irishman.&#xD;
"I will mention the circumstance to Mr. Granville, and I&#xD;
wish you good morning " coolly observed Monck-&#xD;
"Bye-bye. Drop in any time and take a glass of -wine,"&#xD;
said the indomitable O'Doemall-&#xD;
"4What an infernal seamp," was Mr. Granville's comment'&#xD;
upon Marion's report. "Never pnind, Marion; I want you to&#xD;
call every day upon that impudent fellow until you shame him&#xD;
into paying it. Nordheim owe him!, He never owed any&#xD;
body in his life. 'He was, uncommonly particular in that re-&#xD;
gard," continued Mr. Granville.&#xD;
"I think it will be a waste of my time, but as you wish it, I&#xD;
will call until I see there is no hope. Shame him  That will&#xD;
be a tiresome job," was Marion's comment upon the business.&#xD;
The next day Marion went again in No. 20 New street, but&#xD;
at a later hour. The clerk, Thomas, was there, engaged play-.&#xD;
ing marbles on the store floor with another' boy.&#xD;
" Where is Mr. O'Doemall ?" demanded Marion.&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
130&#xD;
&#xD;
"Gone to dinner," replied the boy.&#xD;
"Coming back soon ?" asked Marion.&#xD;
"Immediately. Going to wait?   Please tell him, sir, when&#xD;
he comeS, that I've gone home," and before Marion could ex-&#xD;
press the least dissent to a proposition that'left the responsi-&#xD;
bility of the store and its goods upon him, the boy was out of&#xD;
sight as well as .hearing.&#xD;
s6 I am in a fix. Suppose O'Doemall don't come at all? But&#xD;
I will wait awhile, anyhow."&#xD;
Presently a very respectable-looking, middle-aged woman&#xD;
entered, and enquired for Mr. O'Doemall.&#xD;
"lHe is not in, madam, and will not be for some time. I am&#xD;
waiting to see him about some money."&#xD;
"Oh ; do you owe him any money, sir ?" asked the woman..&#xD;
"No, indeed. But he owes' me, o rather the firm that I am&#xD;
a clerk with," replied Ma-ion.&#xD;
"And do you think he will pay you'? Do you think he will&#xD;
pay me, or any body else he owes&#xD;
Marion looked at the woman, who was in a state of violent&#xD;
excitement.&#xD;
"Does he owe you much ?" he asked.&#xD;
"Only seventy-two dollars, but it has ruined me, and my&#xD;
husband-goes out now to work at days' work.  But perhaps&#xD;
you, sir, can. tell me what I ought to do. Mr. O'Doemall&#xD;
served us a dirty 'trick."&#xD;
"If you will tell me how he incurred the debt,- with all the&#xD;
particulars, if I can give you good advice, I will 'do so," said.&#xD;
Marion; who began to be interested in the matter.&#xD;
"-It is a long story, but I will tell you all about it. Well,&#xD;
sir, you must know that me and my sister Mary used to do fine&#xD;
needle-work in the old country. I married, and came to this&#xD;
country with my husband,' and he got a good situation. 'Then&#xD;
he says to me, 'Now, Bridge t dear, I am. making a little&#xD;
money, and we have got a little saved up, and as yon and Mary-&#xD;
can do fine work, -I think the best we can do is to tate .a little&#xD;
store somewhere up town, and you can make and sill shirts&#xD;
and sich like, and gentlemen's. underclothing, and, I shall&#xD;
be able to send a good many hotel people to buy of you.' Well,&#xD;
we got a little store just big enough to hold us and a few good.?&#xD;
up in Broadway, near Broome street. We had not been open&#xD;
a great many weeks, but was doing uncommon well, when one&#xD;
evening, bad luck to him, who should come in but Mr. O'Do-&#xD;
emall. ' Ah,' said he, ' fine nice store. Show me some of yotgr&#xD;
best shirts. I must patironise you, and I will buy a dozen. 3I&#xD;

want the finest linen shirts.' I showed him our best, and&#xD;
asked him two dollars a piece. They would not do, but he&#xD;
said, 'You seem honest young women, and I will trust you to&#xD;
make me a dozen of the finest linen shirts at six dollars each.&#xD;
I must have them in a week ; and more than that, if you do&#xD;
them well, and suit me, I will bring young Coster, Astor, Lord&#xD;
Lennox, and some other fashionable young fellows, my&#xD;
friends, and we- will get you up a first-rate business.'&#xD;
Oh, sir, that O'Doemall has a 'tongue in his head, and. he&#xD;
wagged it to some purpose.  He set me and my sister Mary&#xD;
almost crazy. We thought our fortunes were more than made.&#xD;
We took our good cash, and went and purchased the very&#xD;
finest linen to make this dozen shirts, and we both worked&#xD;
night and day until they were finished. One Saturday evening&#xD;
he called for the shirts. * They were all packed up ever so'&#xD;
nice. . He winked and looked at every one, and he talked all&#xD;
the while about his magnificent room, and that he could not&#xD;
bear to stop at a hotel, and I do not know what.  I thought&#xD;
he was a marquis at least. At last he says-..&#xD;
'Seventy-two dollars, eh? That is cheap enough. I have&#xD;
paid, in London, twenty guineas for shirts not half as good.&#xD;
But you must send them round to my house in Prince street,&#xD;
it is only a few  doors.'&#xD;
"I called my husband's little brother, Felix, and he took the&#xD;
bundle. Then Mr. O'Doemall began to feel, in his. pockets,&#xD;
and he took an old wood cane and laid it upon' a chair.  He&#xD;
felt-felt.-I asked him if he had lost any thing. He said no,&#xD;
but that he had dressed for, dinner; and left two 'hundred&#xD;
dollars in his-vest pocket.&#xD;
It will make no difference,' said he ; 'your little boy can&#xD;
be trusted, I suppose, and if so, I will give the .seventy-two&#xD;
dollars to him.'&#xD;
" We told him to trust 'the boy-we did not like to refuse to&#xD;
let the shirts go, but he went, 'and the boy too. Presently the&#xD;
boy returned..&#xD;
I want to get the gentleman's cane.'&#xD;
"'Where are the shirts ?'&#xD;
He is holding the shirts while I cane back for his&#xD;
cane|'&#xD;
"The poor boy went away again, but it was a long time&#xD;
before he came back, and then it was to tell us that he could .&#xD;
not find Mr. O'Doemall. We could not believe that so gentle-&#xD;
manly a person would commit so cruel a wrong upon two&#xD;

day we found that he had never lived in the house in Prince&#xD;
street.  It broke us up at our little place.  So great a loss&#xD;
disheartened us; we did not try to do any' more.  It was&#xD;
long before I found out where he did business. I have been&#xD;
several times, but MKr. O'Doemall laughs at me. -Says he will&#xD;
pay me, but that I ought to pay him for teaching me a lesson&#xD;
in not trusting.  Oh, I don't know what to do.  I am afraid&#xD;
we will never get paid ;" and here the poor woman relieved&#xD;
herself by a flood of tears.&#xD;
"What a rascal he must be, to be sure  "&#xD;
"But that ain't all, sir.. He got acquainted with my poor&#xD;
sister Mary. She was a very beautiful girl, sir, and she met&#xD;
him and took walks in St. John's Park with Mr. O'Doemalli&#xD;
and she has never been herself since, and I fear, sir, she is&#xD;
bewitched after him."&#xD;
"Is it possible such a man is allowed to walk the streets ?"&#xD;
"But I am not not quite done yet.  My husband went to&#xD;
Mr. O'Doemall, and gaye him a piece of his miud.  The very&#xD;
next day he was turned out of his situation at the hotel, and I&#xD;
do believe that Mr. O'Doemall was the occasion of it. Now he&#xD;
goes out to days' work, when he can get any thing to 0do.&#xD;
But here he comes, Mr. O'Doemall."&#xD;
. " Aha, my sweetest plant from ould Ireland is it there you&#xD;
are ?" laughingly exclaimed O'Doemall-and then noticing&#xD;
Marion, he added, "and the future husband of the delicious&#xD;
Miss Granville."&#xD;
"Mr. O'Doemall, good-bye," exclaimed the indignant Ma-&#xD;
rion as he left the store.  That evening he told Mr. Granville&#xD;
the.story of the shirts, and the claim of three hundred dollars&#xD;
was placed in a lawyer's hands. 'Marion was. told that he&#xD;
need not call on the New 'street wine merchant any more.&#xD;

vile devoted much more of his attention to business than ever.&#xD;
He was at his office early in the morning, and except to go to&#xD;
his meals,.never left until ten o'clock at night. Some changes&#xD;
had taken place at his home. Tom Granville bad some time&#xD;
previously left his house and home in Chambers street, to de-&#xD;
vote his whole time to Miss Norris. As soon a's it became evi-&#xD;
dent to Mrs, Thomas Granville that her husband had utterly&#xD;
abandoned her, and had openly connected himself with Miss&#xD;
Norris-w-which he did immediately after the death of Mr. Nord-&#xD;
heim-she sent a note to her brother-in-law, Pitt Granville.&#xD;
He came at once to Chambers street.&#xD;
"Tell me nothing, Kate, about Tom. I know all. What do&#xD;
you intend to do ?"&#xD;
"It is useless my incurring the expense of keeping house&#xD;
alone, I think. I have no one 'but my sister, and she can take&#xD;
her departure for Baltimore at any moment."&#xD;
" Then give up tl e house at once, sell off the furniture to&#xD;
the best advantage, and come and take charge of my house.&#xD;
Isabel is too young to be burdened with a housekeeper's cares&#xD;
and anxieties, and besides she needs looking after. She is very&#xD;
inexperienced, and as her aunt, you are the proper person to&#xD;
take charge of her."&#xD;
" This is really a proposition that I could not have expected.&#xD;
I do not know how to thank you."&#xD;
"There is no occasion for thanks-I am the obliged party,&#xD;
and if you say you will come, Kate, there is an end of it. Make&#xD;
your arrangements, and come, as quick as you can."&#xD;
The result of this conversation was, that 'Mrs. Kate Gran-&#xD;
ville was installed as mistress in State 'street. Isabel liked&#xD;
her aunt, and was delighted at her taking charge. To Mrs,&#xD;
Kate Granville it was the most acceptable thing that could have&#xD;
occurred. The scandal afloat in reference to her, and the&#xD;
separation between Tom and herself would be silenced, for&#xD;
certainly the world would say there could be no blame attached&#xD;
to Mrs. Tom Granville, if her husband's brother, a large and&#xD;
extensive merchant, should receive her at 'his house; not only&#xD;
that, but take her to keep house, and ,take the charge of his&#xD;
daughter,.&#xD;
Mrs. Kate Granville had not resided with' her brother-in-law&#xD;
but a few weeks, when her keen eyes discovered that there&#xD;
w sop e sort of-a secret between' her niece Isabel and Marion&#xD;
Mo    . She was satisfied that notes and letters passed between&#xD;
the  wo young people. Marion was a regular visitor at the&#xD;
house ini State street, and was there a hundred times unsus-&#xD;

&#xD;
pected, because he was now the confidential clerk of Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville, and it was necessary that he_ should see him frequently.&#xD;
Sometimes Mr. Granville would be confined to the house for a&#xD;
few days, by sickness. 'Then' Marion would be there half a&#xD;
dozen times a day. He never came but Isabel contrived to&#xD;
see and speak with him, if it was only for a moment.&#xD;
Aunt Kate determined to put an end to this in some manner,&#xD;
for she was not certain her brother would like the idea of an&#xD;
attachment between Marion and Isabel. The former was but&#xD;
a clerk, and although Mr. Granville seemed to be very fond of&#xD;
him, yet she knew that being fond of a youth as a clerk, and&#xD;
approving of him for a son-in-law, was entirely a different mat-&#xD;
ter. She took Isabel to task the first opportunity, and taxed&#xD;
her with being in love or engaged to Marion'Monk. The fair&#xD;
girl could only reply to the charge on the instant with a flood&#xD;
of tears.&#xD;
"Don't deny it, Bella dear. There is no very great crme,&#xD;
and you can tell Aunty all about it-how it happened."&#xD;
Thus coaxed, Isabel very soon took the' advice, and made&#xD;
Aunt Kate her confidant. At first the sister-in-law concluded&#xD;
that it was her duty to inform her brother of circumstances&#xD;
that so, nearly concerned his domestic happiness ; but when&#xD;
she listened to Bella's pleadings, her anxieties, and her confi-&#xD;
dent assurances that if Aunt did tell Papa, that he would turn&#xD;
her out of doors, as he 'had done her brother Walter, and not&#xD;
only that, but that he would discharge poor Marion from his&#xD;
employ, and probably ruin him and his prospects for life., and&#xD;
all "for no good," Aunt Kate hesitated. Then Isabel told&#xD;
her that Marion was not to blame, and that it\was her persua-&#xD;
sion that had made him conceal his attachment' from her father.&#xD;
Finally Aunt Kate was persuaded to keep silence so far as Mr.&#xD;
Granville was concerned, provided Isabel would agree to sub-&#xD;
mit the correspondence between her lover and herself to Aunt&#xD;
Kate's inspection, and that no further letters should be sent or&#xD;
received unless she inspected them. Again, it was understood&#xD;
that Marion should be informed that Kate knew all about it,&#xD;
and that she would converse freely with him upon thesubject.&#xD;
Isabel affectionately kissed her Aunt after all these prelimina-&#xD;
ries had been settled upon, and she felt her mind much re-&#xD;
lieved. She dreaded the anger of her father. With Aunt&#xD;
Kate as her confidential adviser, there was somebody to ,share&#xD;
with her the furious anger of her father, whenever le was in-&#xD;
formed of the attachment, shonid 'it be displeasing to him, or&#xD;
should he have other matrimonial views for her.&#xD;

Mrs. Tom Granville, after Isabel left the parlor in which&#xD;
this memorable explanation had occurred, did not feel at ease&#xD;
in her mind. "I have consented to do wrong, but I have pro-,&#xD;
mised Isabel not to interfere, and I will not. If it comes to&#xD;
Pitt Granville's ears, as Isabel says, the house would come&#xD;
trembling down, and there would be a general smash up. Pitt&#xD;
has a fearful temper when he gets a going. There is poor&#xD;
Walter too-driven off to sea-never been heard from, and his&#xD;
father never allows his name to be mentioned, and all because&#xD;
he chose to fall in love with my sister Madison, and refused to&#xD;
marry that proud, impudent hussy Mag Benson. No-Isabel&#xD;
may run off with this Marion Monck-I certainly will not in-.&#xD;
terfere. But one thing I will do, without delay.-yes, this&#xD;
very morning. This Marion has a warm friend in widow Nord-&#xD;
heim. Of course she is aware of his attachment to Isabel, and&#xD;
she has great influence with Granville. I will go and consult&#xD;
her'About the matter, and take her advice."/ She rang the bell.&#xD;
The servant answered it.&#xD;
" Go tell Thomas the coachman that I wish to go out in about&#xD;
an hour."&#xD;
?Aunt Kate went up to Isabella's room, and informed her that&#xD;
she was obliged to-go out for a few hours, but would be home&#xD;
by dinner-time. Isabel was surprised, but said nothing. She&#xD;
little dreamed of the object that Aunt Kate had in view. If&#xD;
she had done so, Aunt Kate would not have been permitted to&#xD;
go on such an errand ; for with' a keen instinct Isabel had&#xD;
partly discovered a secret that Mrs. Nordheim supposed was&#xD;
safe in her own bosom ; and on one occasion the young Miss&#xD;
had almost allowed jealousy to get the better of her, and she&#xD;
came very near charging Marion with loving LMrs. Nordheim&#xD;
better than lie did herself.&#xD;
Mrs. Granville found Mrs. Nordheim at home. She was&#xD;
dressed in deep mourning, and received Mrs. Tom Granville&#xD;
with unusual courtesy. She felt a deep sympathy for her.&#xD;
Both had lost husbands-one by death, the other by the fasci-&#xD;
nations of a beautiful but bad woman ; for Mrs. Nordheim was&#xD;
not aware that'there were two sides to the story of Tom's sepa.&#xD;
ration from his wife. She had .heard that Tom had left his&#xD;
wife to go and live with Miss Norris.&#xD;
"I am very. happy to see you, Mrs. Granville, very indeed;&#xD;
and I cannot tell you how glad I was to hear that 'you had&#xD;
found a refuge from your domestic difficulties in the house of&#xD;
the elder Mr. Granville. It is an arrangement that must be&#xD;
very gratifying to all patties, for my beautiful friend Isabel is&#xD;
&#xD;
too young and inexperienced to have charge of so extensive an&#xD;
establishment as Mr. Granville's, and you cn relieve her of&#xD;
all care, and be a mother to her. Poor girl! She needs a&#xD;
mother, for I think Mr. Granville has an extremely bad tem-&#xD;
per, although he can be so pleased ind smile so amiably in his&#xD;
out-door intercourse."&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheim spoke with animation, and from the heart.&#xD;
i I really believe, Mrs. Nordheim, that you do'feel what you&#xD;
express; and you have never joined in the lying scandal about&#xD;
me, although my name was connected with your husband's. He&#xD;
was a good friend, and assisted me. What his ultimate mo-&#xD;
tives may have been, he can only settle with his God. I could&#xD;
not do less than be grateful for his kindness, which was be-&#xD;
stowed upon many occasions when I assure you I needed kind-&#xD;
ness. But don't let us talk, Mrs. Nordhein, of what gives me&#xD;
the horrors. I came up this morning for an express purpose."&#xD;
"Indeed! Can I guess that purpose ?"&#xD;
I presume you are aware of the relations that exist between&#xD;
Marion Monck and my niece, Isabel Grauville ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheiim sat rocking herself to and fro in a Well-&#xD;
cushioned chair, and when she caught the last words, the chair&#xD;
ceased its motion, and the occupaut placed her hand for a mo-&#xD;
ment upon her heart, as if to discover that it beat. Her&#xD;
breath caught for a moment, and her face was as pale as death.&#xD;
It was but for a moment that she hesitated, and then she asked&#xD;
" The relation between Marion and Isabella ?"&#xD;
" Yes. I suppose Marion has told you that he has long been&#xD;
attached to Isabel, that it is reciprocated on her part, and that&#xD;
they are engaged to be married. They are both fearful that     LI&#xD;
their views may conflict with those of my stern brother, and&#xD;
they are both keeping the arrangement veryquiet.  i coaxed&#xD;
it out of Isabel this morning and knowing how warmly you are&#xD;
attached to Marion, I presumed of course that be had at least&#xD;
informed you of it. Is it possible that he has not done so ?" .&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheim broke out into a laugh that actually sur-&#xD;
prised Mrs. Granville.&#xD;
"Told me-me ! No, he did not tell me. Why, it is the&#xD;
most comical thing I have heard of for a long time !Marion&#xD;
in love, and engraged to be married to that little girl, Isabel   I&#xD;
Granville !-ha, ha,  ia! It is a good joke, is it not ?"       !&#xD;
Mrs Tom G3ranville could not, or did not see the joke ; and&#xD;
she replied that her niice was not sQ very little ; on the con-&#xD;
trary that she xlas a fail grown young lady.&#xD;
t0, my dear Mrs. Granville,'I meant no harm. To tell you&#xD;

the truth, your information has somewhat surprised me. Ma-&#xD;
rion is not yet twenty years old, and' it is rather young to think&#xD;
of getting married."&#xD;
" It is indeed. But what can be done ?  I thought I would&#xD;
come up and have an explanation with you."&#xD;
"You are very kind indeed, but I must decline having any&#xD;
thing to do with the matter. Marion has not told me of it, and&#xD;
therefore I shall say nothing. Your conversation shall go no&#xD;
further. I will keep it in my own breast;" and she placed&#xD;
her hand there for a moment, as if to press the secret in,, so&#xD;
that it would be safe.&#xD;
These two ladies continued in conversation for over an hour&#xD;
upon almost every topic of the day. Mrs. Nordheim took the&#xD;
lead, and Mrs. Tom Granville wondered at such a flow of good&#xD;
spirits. ,At last the visitor left. No sooner had the door&#xD;
closed, than Mrs. Nordheim fell at full length upon the floor,&#xD;
and rolled in agony.&#xD;
"0 , my God, preserve my reason ! I that have so long&#xD;
loved him in secret! I-that -now all obstacles to my dreams&#xD;
for years is removed! He-Marion-our Marion-my Ma-,&#xD;

ball know what I-have suffered ! But it-is over now, and if&#xD;
Marion were to come home I c6uld receive him as calmly as if&#xD;
he was my brother."&#xD;
She rose and resumed her seat. The tears silently poured&#xD;
down her cheeks, but after a few moments she descended to&#xD;
the basement and gave orders to the servants as calmly as if&#xD;
her heart had never known aught but the most peaceful pulsa-&#xD;
tions. Such is life-4&#xD;

Captain Watson-The Shades, in Thames street-A pleasant night there.&#xD;
THE daily life of a merchant in New York is one ro-qnd of&#xD;
routine. He rises in the morning, gets a hasty breakfast,&#xD;
and before nine o'clock reaches his place.of business. If he is&#xD;
a shipping merchant he reads the list of arrivals of that day,&#xD;
and the clearances of vessels the day previous. If he is any&#xD;
other sort of merchant, he reads that portion of' the' journal&#xD;
that affects his peculiar interest. Half an hour with the&#xD;
newspaper in his hand, and then he puts it one side and goes&#xD;
at his work. The letters come from the pest-office-.these he&#xD;
reads, and then transfers them to his bookkeeper to be read&#xD;
and noted. An hour later he goes out into the street and&#xD;
attends to his out-door business, and perhaps stops at a&#xD;
refectory, an oyster cellar, or Delmonico's, and gets a stiff&#xD;
glass of brandy and a bite of something to eat, and then is back&#xD;
to his counting-house or store. Business, business, business.&#xD;
Business in his head, business in his actions, business in his&#xD;
thoughts, business at heart. He is nothing more than a body&#xD;
made up of business. He goes home to dine at five o'clock,&#xD;
and reaches his commercial palace filled with thoughts of busi-&#xD;
ness. He has left a loved wife-been absent from     her nine&#xD;
hours. He las perfect confidence in her, and when he comes&#xD;
home, he tells her how successful he has been in' business.&#xD;
He eats a hurried dinner, but delays longer to drink his wine.&#xD;
He returns to his business again after dinner, ,or if not he&#xD;
takes his hat and goes down to some place of amusement, or&#xD;
.to see some friend. At or before eleven o'clock he is found&#xD;
at home, and after he gets his tod goes to bed.  The next and&#xD;
ten thousand succeeding days, perhaps as long as he lives, is&#xD;
but a repetition of the one day that we have given as a sample.&#xD;

He may acquire money, but even that is not all he desires.&#xD;
lie is never as'happy as when he is admired as the most&#xD;
extensive merchant of his class  He works for that ; he battles&#xD;
for it night and day. As a politician he is a nobody. Expires&#xD;
may be overthrown, kingdoms conquered, a republic cor.&#xD;
rupted-it is nothing to the merchant-it has no connection&#xD;
with his business. He cares not who rules the city, the state,&#xD;
or the nation. He does not, vote-it wouIid take too much tiill&#xD;
aind he would be obliged to indirectly mix with people th t&#xD;
he considers beneath him. Sunday is not a working day. He&#xD;
goes to church becauseit makes a'man more respectable, and&#xD;
helps pass away the time. His religion is a part of his regular&#xD;
business.. In early life he has married, has a family  They&#xD;
become a part of his business. He leaves his wife, perhaps a&#xD;
young charming woman to get aMonig the best way she can&#xD;
with nothing to do. Most women find something to do, and&#xD;
they have it all their own way, for from morning until night,&#xD;
day in and day out, the wife of a New York inerchant can tell&#xD;
at any time where her husband 'is. But could the veil be&#xD;
removed from the careless husband's eyes, he who is a worse&#xD;
slave than the Jane or Tom of the South-...could he imagine&#xD;
for one moment in what manner his wife or the daughters, or&#xD;
the sons occupy their time, his business would lose its charn.&#xD;
An eminent statesman once remarked th-rt it was a remarka-&#xD;
ble fact that -there should be a virtuous- ric/ merchant's wife&#xD;
in New York, and on being asked why he thought this, he&#xD;
answered,&#xD;
" Because, of all the male inhabitants of God's earth, the&#xD;
merchant is the only known class that abandon their vives&#xD;
and daughters without remorse or fear to be seduced, cor-&#xD;
rupted and betrayed by the idle and the vile of the other&#xD;
sex."&#xD;
It was once a good custom in New York for merchants to&#xD;
have their dwellings in the same buildings with their stores. A&#xD;
return to that habit would save from vice thouands of wives.&#xD;
It is a good custom. The merchant can then look after his&#xD;
 business and his honor at the same time.&#xD;
Mr. Granville was just exactly the business man we have de.&#xD;
sribed. Hk ate his meals regularly. He went to church on&#xD;
Sunday. He had a good stock of w-ines in his cellar, and&#xD;
occasionally gave a dinner. It was a pait of his business.&#xD;
Most of those lie invited were business mon. If he invited&#xD;
-others who had genius, it was to make the dinner go off better by&#xD;
having a few intelleetua! persons mixed in the' business eaters.&#xD;

He had lost all hopes of seeing his son Walter again--that is&#xD;
to say, as be wished to see him. He did not regard him as a&#xD;
son but as a sailor, and as his confidence was lost by what&#xD;
the senior Granville called a gross act of filial, disobedience,&#xD;
he determined that his remaining child should be the means&#xD;
of carrying out his design. On one occasion Colonel Bensn_,&#xD;
called in State street. Mr. Grahville was alone. Aunt Kate&#xD;
and Isabel had gone out to spend the evening at Mr. Grasper's.&#xD;
Between the Colonel and Mr. Granville, Walter's name had&#xD;
been a forbidden subject by quiet consent. This evening Mr.&#xD;
Granville alluded to him in the following manner: " Colonel,&#xD;
are you aware that I have never been so crossed in any matter,&#xD;
so completely disappointed, as at the overthrow of my plans,&#xD;
or rather of our mutual plans, in reference to our children,&#xD;
Walter and Margaret?'&#xD;
"Children are inexperienced and great fools, Granville.&#xD;
I confess that I was annoyed for a short time, for Walter was a&#xD;
great favorite of mine. I saw no reason why the match should&#xD;
not have been a happy one. We could-have started the young&#xD;
couple fairly in life, and our own minds would have been at&#xD;
rest, I'll tell you. Mr. Granville, that one of the greatest&#xD;
anxieties'in a person's mind, if he has sons or daughters, is&#xD;
that they will make an unfortunate match, especially-so if you&#xD;
have money. There are so many prowlers about in a city like&#xD;
this-chaps that have got nothing, but -dress well and can keep&#xD;
up appearances, and get intosociety. These fellows keep parents&#xD;
constantly on the look-out. I am never easy in my inwd.&#xD;
There is my son Middleton-he is rising rapidly as a business&#xD;
young uMan. I am delighted with his conduct. lie is not fool-&#xD;
in  about the town at nights, and has formed no bad ac-&#xD;
quiaintances. He will be taken into the firmi before he is much&#xD;
older, and I shall give him the capital that I have invested in that&#xD;
house, and withdraw my own name altogether. Now, would it&#xD;
not be enough to make a man curse his father, if that favorite&#xD;
son should fall in love with some pretty shop-girl or*sonte.&#xD;
angelic book-folder?  Yet I should not be surprised at -it.&#xD;
It would only be in keeping with the proceeding of sons&#xD;
generally who have wealthy parents."&#xD;
"I hope Middleton will never take any step, my dear Colonel,&#xD;
that would be so utterly repugnant to you views-for his future.&#xD;
I have to keep a careful watch upon my daughter Isabella, but&#xD;
thank God, s1e is heart whole, and will never disobey or cross&#xD;
my wishes ; but as double security, I have got Torn's wife here,&#xD;

"With all my heart, Granville; but we must manage somewhat&#xD;

her fascinations to the best advantage and when we find there&#xD;
is a liking, then we can carry out our views ; but don't let us&#xD;
try to do in two months what may take two years and we shall&#xD;
see if we don't have.more success in this marriage plot, than&#xD;
in the other one, which resulted, I am sorry to say, in losing&#xD;
your son, at least temporarily."&#xD;
-I agree with you, perfectly, Colonel. I already perceive&#xD;
that your plan is a more feasible one than mine."&#xD;
The return of Mrs. Tom Granville and Isabella interrupted&#xD;
the conversation of these two worthies, whQ were a fair sample&#xD;
of nine in ten of the parents of New York, who have marriageable&#xD;
children. Business. Position. Money. These are regarded&#xD;
as the materials for a suitable match. Honesty, talent, health,&#xD;
on the one part--beauty, virtue, amiability, intelligence, on&#xD;
the oiher, are not counted in the game. If they were, there&#xD;
would be few matches made between rich men's sons and&#xD;
daughters.&#xD;
Colonel Benson was a man who had moved much in society,&#xD;
and could be very fascinating when he chose to be so.  When&#xD;
Isabella had removed her bohnet and shawl, -he gazed at her&#xD;
for some time in silence.  He was more struck than ever with&#xD;
her extreme loveliness. He drew ,his chair near her, and&#xD;
engaged her in a very animated conversation for some time.&#xD;
He was delighted with intelligent conversation. Then he&#xD;
asked her to play and sing some of his old favorite English&#xD;
songs, and without a moment's hesitation, or any hypocritical&#xD;
arts, which young ladies frequently use to enhance the value&#xD;
of this performance, she arose and went to the piano, which&#xD;
&#xD;
151&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
was an upright English piano, importect expressly from Eng-&#xD;
land for his child's use, by Mr. Granville. Isabella played all&#xD;
the English airs that she had' learned to play to. please her&#xD;
father.  When she had finished, the colonel looked at Mr.&#xD;
Granville. There was an expression in his eyes which the&#xD;
father understood. He saw that the colonel was delighted with&#xD;
the prospect of such a wife for his son, and he could not.&#xD;
control his feelings, but turned to Isabella and said:&#xD;
"My dear Isabella, I am very glad I did not bring my son&#xD;
Middleton with me, for had he been in my.place this evening,&#xD;
you would have set him crazy.  But I will venture him the&#xD;
next time I come.&#xD;
Isabella shuddered-she hardly knew why, but at that&#xD;
moment the bell rang, and shortly after, although ,it was late,&#xD;
Marion Monek entered theparlor.  le bowed politely to all&#xD;
in the room, and then approached Mr. Granville with some&#xD;
letters-&#xD;
"The ship Dorothea, Captain Watson, is below, sir. She is&#xD;
just in from Batavia with a cargo of sugar, and is consigned&#xD;
to the late firm.  Captain Watson came to the office only a.&#xD;
few moments ago. I took him up to the City Hotel. Ie will&#xD;
go down to the ship early in the morning, and wishes some&#xD;
directions ; but I will wait until you have read your letters."&#xD;
Meanwhile Mr. Gra'nville was occupied in reading his let-&#xD;
ters, and as he read he commented upon them.&#xD;
"The Dorothea will make a glorious voyage.  Her sugar&#xD;
will bring eleven cents a poiund from the ship, and they . on,1y&#xD;
cost five Spanish dollars the pecul."&#xD;
" How much is a pecul, Mr. Granville?" asked Col. Ben-&#xD;
son,&#xD;
&amp;amp; One hundred and thirty-three and one-third   English&#xD;
pounds. The ship will clear twenty-five thousand dollars in&#xD;
'her cargo, and pay a good round freight to her owner ;" re-&#xD;
plied Mr. Granville.&#xD;
" Is the cargo owned by you ?" asked Colonel Benson.&#xD;
"It is owned one half by my late firm, and the other half&#xD;
belongs to John McGreen of Philadelphia, who also owns ,the&#xD;
ship. I am his agent here," replied Mr. Granville.&#xD;
Some general conversation occurred, and then Colonel Ben-&#xD;
son remarked:&#xD;
" Well, Granville, I see you have something to do to-night,&#xD;
and I will take my departure."&#xD;
" You nee!1 not be in a hurry, although I shall, call on Cap-&#xD;

Granville.&#xD;
Colonel Benson took leave of the two ladies, 'and soon aftar&#xD;
they bade Mr. Granville and Marion a pleasant good-night,&#xD;
and retired to their rooms.  Mr. Granville and his elerk were&#xD;
left alone.&#xD;
"A capital voyage the Dorothea will make, eh?  H1ow does&#xD;
Captain Watson look ?  I will go up and see the old sea dog&#xD;
presently. You must send a note to Havemeyers and the&#xD;
other sugar refiners early in the morning, and see if we can't&#xD;
sell this cargo of sugar from the dock. It will save us a great&#xD;
deal of expense. You were late at the office to-night. Lucky,&#xD;
too, or you would have missed Captain Watson. , How is Mrs.&#xD;
Nordheiin ?"-demanded Mr. Granville.&#xD;
"Quite well. I am going to leave there."&#xD;
" Leave there ! Why, I thought it was almost -a permanent&#xD;
home ? What is out.? Have you and her quarrelled ?" de-&#xD;
manded Mr. Granville.&#xD;
"Not that I am ware of.  She iold me this afternoon that&#xD;
slie should probably give up the house soon, and -although she&#xD;
did iot wish to incommode me, yet the sooner I prooared a&#xD;
home somewhere else, the, better."&#xD;
"Short and sweet. What are you goipg to do'?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Granville.&#xD;
"1[ have not made up my mind yet.   This sudden notice&#xD;
bas taken me all aback. I must-try and get a boarding-house&#xD;
somewhere nearer the office," said'Marion,&#xD;
"You will do nothing of the kind. . To-morrow do you come&#xD;
here with your trunk.  I will have a room fixed up for you,&#xD;
and you will be perfectly at home. It will be very convenient&#xD;
for me. I shall save for you and myself a large amount of&#xD;
boot and shoe-leather," said Mr. G.&#xD;
"Really, you are very kind, but shall I not put you to in-&#xD;
convenience ?" enquired Marion.&#xD;
"rWhat hae you got to do with tbat ? You are well ac-&#xD;
'quainted with my daughter, and with Mrs. Tom  Granville.&#xD;
Coming here will not be like going among strangers.  But&#xD;
come, let us go up and see Captain Tommy Watson," said Mr.&#xD;
Granville.&#xD;
The merchant and his 'clerk went up to the City Hotel.&#xD;
Mr. Willard smilingly told them that Captain Watson had&#xD;
left word that e he had gone round to the Shades in Thames street,&#xD;
directly in the rear of the hotel. To"a the Shades" they Went, and ,&#xD;
there they-found the Captain with his mug of ale' on the little&#xD;

table before him, and enjoying a cigar with great guo.  Mr.&#xD;
Granville and Marion took seats at the same table, and soon&#xD;
had their'" mugs " before them. The main room was crowded&#xD;
with small tables, and every table had four to six persons&#xD;
about it.. In the center of the room was a-large round table&#xD;
which accommodated twenty persons..  These were dinkig,&#xD;
singing songs,, telling stories, and enjoying themselves without&#xD;
limit.&#xD;
"I did not know that there was such a place as this in New&#xD;
York," remarked Marion.&#xD;
"I did,' said Captain Tommy Watson.    "It is the only&#xD;
place where you can get a good glass of beer; and a  Welsh&#xD;
rabbit.'  I always come here when I am in New York.  Be-&#xD;
sides the'good drinks and eatables, there is always lots of fun&#xD;
going on here, and every hour the character of the guests&#xD;
change. In the morning you have one class that come here to&#xD;
get their breakfast.  Tea or coffee and a mutton-chop, or a&#xD;
deliciously done beef steak.  Towards eleven o'clock, a class&#xD;
come here to get a mug of beer, some bread and cheese or a&#xD;
cold cut.  From twelve to three, inerehant%-some of the best&#xD;
in town, come to get a regular feed.-a downright dinner,&#xD;
Then in the evening, all the leading literary men and wits&#xD;
come here, and in addition, a lot of chaps who have a little&#xD;
spare change, come and.spend it, and hear the geniuses sing&#xD;
and talk ;" said Captain Watson&#xD;
Captain Watson's description of the Shades was good a&#xD;
quarterof a century ago.  But now, although the Shades is&#xD;
still in existence, and kept in the same place, yet its custom&#xD;
has sadly fallen off, and- their character changed;   Now and&#xD;
then a stray English actor lodges andboards there, and some-&#xD;
times one of the ancient guests drop in to see how his old&#xD;
haunt looks. :But the majority of the customers have gone up&#xD;
town, or to their graves, and the'Shades is desolate.&#xD;
The Captaintand his consignee, Mr. Granville and Marion,&#xD;
remained until long after midnight listing to their songs, while&#xD;
partalsing of a nice little bird supper, garnished with chain:&#xD;
page, which Mr. Granville had ordered. The Captain con-&#xD;
tributed his quota of enjoyment by telling anecdotes of his&#xD;
recent voyage to and from Java.&#xD;
When they parted for the night, it was with the understand'&#xD;
ing that the Cptain would come up with the good ship Doro,&#xD;
thea, and lay her .along side th  Rector street, as early: in the&#xD;
morning as was practicable.&#xD;

WHEN Miss Norris communicated to the Count Falsechinski&#xD;
the secret of Mrs. Woodruff, that noble gentleman forthwith&#xD;
sent a note to the Bond street lady. He received a reply the&#xD;
same day, requesting him to call so soon' as be could make it&#xD;
convenient. -It was not long before the Count made his appear-&#xD;
ance on the premises. He stood upon the steps and then rung&#xD;
the bell, but noticing that the outer door was partially opened,&#xD;
he passed in, and found himself in a short hall. At the end was&#xD;
a second mahogany. door, which was fast, and another bell-&#xD;
handle could be seen at the sidd door.&#xD;
There was every sign af the residence of some weally per-&#xD;
son, at the same time, it was evident that the arrangement of&#xD;
two doors was very convenient for persons who did not wish to&#xD;
be seen entering the house, as they woulh not be kept a 1mo-&#xD;
ment on the outside of the street door. Ladies or, gentlemen&#xD;
eould run up the marble steps, push open the door, enter, and'&#xD;
push the door to, agaip. There they were safe from  observa-&#xD;
tion, and could leisurely ring the second bell. "This the Count&#xD;
did. A colored girl soon after made her appearance..&#xD;
I wish to see madam."&#xD;
"Your name, sir ?"&#xD;
The Count Falsechinski."&#xD;
The inner door was carefully closed by the girl, who went to-&#xD;
seek her mistress, .1She returned, opened the door sulcient to&#xD;
allow the.Count to enter, then carefully closed and locked it,&#xD;
and led the way to the rear parlor.&#xD;
"Take a seat, Mr. Count. Missus will be down directly."&#xD;
&#xD;
The door was partially bpen which connected with the next&#xD;
parlor. The Count entered it, and found that there was still a&#xD;
front parlor. Three parlors, magnificently furnished,.occupied&#xD;
the floor. The walls were covered with paintings, and the fur-&#xD;
niture was of the most costly description. 'The rear parlor&#xD;
opened upon a balcony, which was so covered with creeping&#xD;
vines as almost to exclude the light, and prevented any one&#xD;
from looking into the yard. Between the two rear windows&#xD;
stood a bronze stand with a marble top. Upon it was a mar-&#xD;
ble bust of Daniel Webster. One side of the room, between&#xD;
each recess of the fire-places, were large mahogany bopok-cases,&#xD;
with looking-glass doors. The Count tried to open some of&#xD;
them, but found all carefully locked. She must have a large&#xD;
library, thought the Count, if these splendid cases are filled&#xD;
with books. On the opposite side of the room was a small ta-&#xD;
ble, covered with a fine white cloth.  Upon- it, was a large&#xD;
quarto, bound with velvet. The Count opened the book. It&#xD;
was the Bible. "Queer female this," muttered the Count, and&#xD;
tired with looking about the room, he partly reclined upon one&#xD;
of the superb sofas that-lined the room. Presently the lady of&#xD;
the house entered, and walking rapidly across the room, took&#xD;
-the Count's hand, and bade him not rise. She seated herself&#xD;
by his side. The lady, who was no other than Mrs. Woodruff,&#xD;
was dressed in deep mourning, and also wore a widow's cap.&#xD;
" Count, I received your note, and I presume you received&#xD;
mnine,or you would not be here."&#xD;
The Count bowed politely, and said he had received the&#xD;
note.&#xD;
" Yours, Count, made me aware that you possessed a secret&#xD;
of mine, and that it ws in your power to do me injury or&#xD;
continued Mrs. Woodruff.&#xD;
"Good, as.you may decide," interrupted the Count.&#xD;
"1 will be very frank with you, Count. If you are not dis-&#xD;
posed to injure me, you can be of essential service to me, and&#xD;
at the same time benefit- yourself most materially; but it is&#xD;
necessary that we should perfectly understand each other,"&#xD;
remarked Mrs. Woodruff.&#xD;
The Count nodded his head in approbation.&#xD;
"What, Count, do you require ?" she asked&#xD;
"Money, and I will earn it," replied the Count.&#xD;
"Do you mean to have me, infer that if I pay you a certain&#xD;
sum of money, that you will not only keep-my secret, but that-&#xD;
you will serve me in any way that I shall point out r" asked&#xD;

I do,"replied the Count.&#xD;
"Will you take a solemn oath upon that Bible yonder that&#xD;
you will never, directly or indirectly, betray me or my inter-&#xD;
ests ?" replied the hostess.&#xD;
I will."&#xD;
*The lady went and got the Bible, and as she resumed her&#xD;
seat, placed it upon, her knees, and again addressed the -Count.&#xD;
"What money will you require?"&#xD;
I wish the sum of one, thousand dollars in cash. I then&#xD;
wish you to pay me five hundred dollars every three months,&#xD;
so long as I serve you," said the cool Count.&#xD;
"Swear upon this book what I require, and I will agree .to&#xD;
your proposition." The Count took the oath.&#xD;
"Excuse me a moment."' The lady left the room, but was&#xD;
not absent over five minutes, when she again took a seat by the&#xD;
Count, and placed in his hands two bank notes of five hundred&#xD;
dollars each. "Three months hence, Count, you will receive&#xD;
another note of five hundred, and so on for the year at least, or,&#xD;
as long as our bargain holds good. Count, will you tell me by&#xD;
what iieans you discovered the character of my establishment?&#xD;
I do not ask you save in this regard. ,Will the source of. your&#xD;
information be. used again to others ?" asked th6 lady.&#xD;
"'I cannot give you the name of the person who informed me&#xD;
as to your real/pursuits, but I can and do guarantee 'that 'it&#xD;
shall not be repeated by that party to your injury," replied the&#xD;
Count.&#xD;
" I am satisfied,; and now let us understnd each other. You&#xD;
move, Count, in a certain circle. You will make many valua-&#xD;
ble acquaintances. Such as you, deem will be of value for me&#xD;
to make, I wish you to be the means offbringing us together. . I&#xD;
want none but the highest-those who are wealhy-or hold&#xD;
positions 'of political power, or foreigners who "are titled, or&#xD;
leading men, in- the. professions.  Do you understand me&#xD;
askIed Mrs  Woodroff.-&#xD;
" Perfectly ; and I will carry' out your views in that regard-.&#xD;
What else ?" asked the Count.-&#xD;
I wish you to accompany me to church, to places of public&#xD;
amusement, and to the select, fashionable parties among the&#xD;
higher classes of society," was the reply.&#xD;
"What ?   Do I understand you to say that you visit in the&#xD;
highest circles ?' asked the astonished 'Count.&#xD;
" Did you not meet me at Mrs. Nordhieimu's'?" she asked-.&#xD;
Oh, ah, lady, yes - that was because you were a neighbor,&#xD;
I suppose; but  here are higher classes," said the Count&#xD;

Very well; we shall see. Read this note,' replied Mr§.&#xD;
Woodruff, and she banded him a hote.&#xD;
The Count read an invitation addressed to hiniself from Mr.&#xD;
and Mrs. Parker, inviting-him to a party at their house 'that&#xD;
igh~t.&#xD;
" I see, my dear Count, that.you are sonvewhat astonished,&#xD;
but I have a note of invitation, and -had no difficulty, I assure&#xD;
you, in getting one for you. Nothing- will give me more&#xD;
pleasure thap to accompany you there," smilingly observed&#xD;
Mrs. Woodruff.&#xD;
"No. Not accompany me, but meet me thbte," she con-&#xD;
tinued, correcting herself.&#xD;
The Count'soon after took his leave,, but when the night&#xD;
came, he was at the party, and was one of the. favored ones.&#xD;
Mrs. Woodruff was, as usual, quiet and retired, but made many&#xD;
acquaintances, particularly aniong the young married ladies.&#xD;
Mrs. Parker was the life and soul of her party, but the Count&#xD;
could not help noticing that one of her guests seemed to be an&#xD;
object of the deepest interest to the hostess. It was no other&#xD;
than Mtr. John ODoemall, the wine merchant. He was dressed&#xD;
superbly, and certainly far outshone the Count, who did not at-&#xD;
tenmpt to rivalkhim.&#xD;
- "What an impudent scoundrel that O'Doemall is !" said the&#xD;
Count to Mrs. Woodraff, as tbe carriage which contained them&#xD;
drove.off from the stately residence of the Parkers. "1 had&#xD;
half a mind to give Mrs. Parker a warning."&#xD;
" It is welL, you did-not, Count. Mrs. Parker is one of my&#xD;
oldest friends aid acquaintances."&#xD;
The Count gave a prolonged "Whew '-" And Mr. O'Do-&#xD;
emall also ?" he asked.&#xD;
Yes; and .some day I may lell you inore," she replied.&#xD;
The Count became a friend of Mrs. Woodruff, attended her&#xD;
at church, theatres, and private parties, and .his salary was&#xD;
regularly paid, and as-fast as he received it he deposited it&#xD;
with his Wall street- bankers, adding constantly to the amount&#xD;
to his credit already in Prime, Ward &amp;amp; King's 'hands 8 8&#xD;
weeks and months passed on, no. one. suspecting 'or dreaming&#xD;
that Mrs. Woodruff was not the wealthy pigulady that she&#xD;
was supposed to be. The rector of the fashionable church at&#xD;
which she worshipped paid her a formal visit at least once a&#xD;
month, and no other female member of his congregation con-&#xD;
ducted herself so unexceptionably as Mrs. Woodruff. No other&#xD;
miade the worthy rector so many presents, and as she seat them&#xD;
through the hands of the sextoni of that fashionable church, no&#xD;

one who held a seat in that church received a bow as she&#xD;
passed into the church, or was shown to her pew with a greater&#xD;
respect.&#xD;
The Count had drawn his salary from Mrs. Woodruff almost&#xD;
a year, when one afternoon, as he was about leaving the office&#xD;
to go to Delmonico's to get his dinner, a note was placed in&#xD;
his hands by the coachman of Mrs. Woodruff.&#xD;
"4Carriage around the corner. Missis say you come right&#xD;
up," observed the coachman.&#xD;
The Count read the-note, and then hastily followed the colored"&#xD;
coachman and took his seat in the carriage. It was driven&#xD;
rapidly to Bond street. He entered the house, and found Mrs.&#xD;
Woodruff in her private parlor, in a state of great excitement.&#xD;
"Ah, Count, 1 am so glad you are come! I have had such&#xD;
a scene !" she exclaimed, as he entered.&#xD;
"-Be calm, Mrs. Woodruff; seat yourself, and tell me all&#xD;
about it. As I have had no dinner, will you order me some-&#xD;
thing, and a bottle of champagne," remarked the Count.&#xD;
The order was given, and Mrs. Woodruff resumed a seat-&#xD;
"Who was the scene with, my lady ?" asked the Count.&#xD;
"0-, with those Parkers. If it were not for me, their wealth&#xD;
could not save them," replied the indignant Woodruff&#xD;
What is out now'?  Tell me all-about it, aud- then if you&#xD;
want advice, I will give it," said ,the Count.-A&#xD;
"Count, could you procure a husband for a young lady of&#xD;
high famiLy, one of the first respectability, if ten thousand dol-&#xD;
lars were placed in her husband's'hands the moment she was&#xD;
married ?" demanded Mrs. Woodruff.,&#xD;
"I dare say I could doso-in fact I know I could. Ten&#xD;
thousand dollars'? Is' the lAdy pretty ? I know fifty young&#xD;
fellows that would marry ten thousand dollars and take the&#xD;
Witch of Endor if she were alive, as the wife additional," re-&#xD;
plied the Count.&#xD;
"Do not joke-I am perfectly serious; and I will tell you,&#xD;
the young lady is Miss Julia Parker, the niece of Mr. Parker,"&#xD;
observed Madame Woodruff.&#xD;
The devil she is! Why, my lady, what is out now ? A&#xD;
beautiful young and virtuous girl like Julia Parker need' not'&#xD;
go begging for a husband. She can take her pick in the mar-o&#xD;
kei," said the astonished Count.&#xD;
"AYes, that is all very-well; but she must be married as a&#xD;
widow with hei child. She won't give up her child," said the&#xD;
lady.                            Whwa h~odNc&#xD;
" Widow-a.child-Mliss Parker ! Wy    htte     l   ik&#xD;

is out now! Tell me all, or don't ask my aid, Where is Miss,&#xD;
Parker ?" continued the Count.&#xD;
"Up stairs, and her aunt has just left. But I made her pull&#xD;
in her horns. I dared her to threaten me. The negro woman&#xD;
took away the child this morning, and the mother frets about&#xD;
it ; but the old she devil Parker insists that she shall go to a&#xD;
party on next Monday night, as though nothing had happened,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Woodruff.&#xD;
"How long has Miss Parker been in this housq ?" asked the&#xD;
Count.&#xD;
" About three weeks. She had a little baby about a week&#xD;
ago," replied Mrs. Woodruff.&#xD;
"'Miss Julia Parker-leetle baby !" repeated the Count,&#xD;
whose eyes actually stuck out with amazement.&#xD;
" No, indeed; Madame Parker needn't put on any of her&#xD;
airs with me. She is a communicant at the.same chureh-that&#xD;
don't matter. She has done it all. That poor girl was as'in-&#xD;
nocent as a babe-unborn, until the outrage was committed upon&#xD;
her, and why was it done ? Who did it ?-what for 1 0, Count,&#xD;
I could tell you such a story as would make your hair curl,&#xD;
without putting. curling tongs anywhere near it," said Mrs.&#xD;
Woodruff in a very excited manner.&#xD;
"Now, my lady, youhave said too much, or not quite enough.&#xD;
I. want to know more," fiercely observed the Count.&#xD;
"You shall know all; and then advise me what to do. That&#xD;
old wretch shan't make a cat's-paw of me-not she. You know&#xD;
that O'Doemall-of course you do. Mrs. Parker chooses to fall&#xD;
in love with him. He of course agreed to it, and they met&#xD;
here, in this house. She wanted a handsome lover-he 'wanted&#xD;
money. Well, he got a few hundreds out of her, and it was&#xD;
more, more. One. day, I told her not to come here any more.&#xD;
So they met afterwards at her Own house. They got pretty&#xD;
bold and imprudent, and one morning Miss Julia happening to&#xD;
go to her aunt's apartments, she caught the naughty O'Doemall&#xD;
and her worthy aunt breaking Commandient.No. Eight. Then&#xD;
there was a scene ! but Mrs. Parker was equal. to the emer-&#xD;
gency. She sent a note to me .at once, enclosing a hundred&#xD;
dollar bill, and requesting a room ready in an hour. It was&#xD;
ready, Mrs. Parker came, and her niece was with her. The&#xD;
niece knew nothing of my business. She knew me as a vis-&#xD;
itor. and a friend. They both took a seat in one of my parlor0&#xD;
Then the aunt complained of being sick, and asked me to let&#xD;
her lie down. The niece went up to the room with her. Then&#xD;
,she ordered up a bottle of Madeira. The servant took it up,&#xD;

O'Doemall came, and he went up of course. -But really I can-&#xD;
-not tell the rest, Count.-it is too horrible," remarked the poor&#xD;
Mrs. Woodruff.-&#xD;
You must tell it all.-go on," said the Count sternly.&#xD;
Be it so. I had other matters to attend to, and my mind'&#xD;
was not called to what Mrs. Parker was doing.,. The three re-&#xD;
mained in that roomi over two hours. Then the man O'Doe-&#xD;
mall slid out of the houge. Then I went up. JuLia, p-oor child,&#xD;
was acting m6re like a maniac than anything else. Mrs. Par-&#xD;
ker frowned, scowled, pinched her even. But still the girl&#xD;
sobbed in such a woeful manner that my suspicions were&#xD;
aroused,-but I could say nothing; and shortly after Mrs. Par-&#xD;
ker took her niece and they left the house, went up the street&#xD;
a short' distance and got into their carriage and drove home.&#xD;
Count, in order to keep that little girl from exposing her aunt,&#xD;
that fashionable 'ady and- her lover had forced the poor girl to&#xD;
lose her innocence. Is not this horrible'? I suspected this&amp;amp;at&#xD;
the time, but it was only recently that Miss Julia told me the&#xD;
facts. The outrage was repeated several times, and she dared&#xD;
not say a word. She became pregnant, and then the aunt in&#xD;
alarm came to me, and to prevent disgrace I agreed to receive&#xD;
and take care of her through her illness, and received a thou.&#xD;
sand dollars for my trouble. She is nearly well, and Mrs. Par-&#xD;
ker, who has Inade her husband believe that Miss Julia is in the&#xD;
country, has hiied a negro woman to take the child to nurse,&#xD;
and wants that her niece shall now return hoine, and take her&#xD;
place in the family circle. - What do you think of it, Count ?"&#xD;
asked -r . Woodruff.&#xD;
"I1think that it is in character with a good many other things.&#xD;
This is a  unny. world. It is all right. Mrs. Parker is one of&#xD;
the leading fashionalde ladies in New York; but why does she.&#xD;
wish to marry her niece in suih a hurry? As a widow, too?"&#xD;
asked the cautious Count.&#xD;
" Because her niece has' become very fond of the child. She&#xD;
says she will keep the-child, and that if she marries, it must&#xD;
be to some one who knows the facts,-.that*is to say, that she&#xD;
is the mother of the child. If any' one who is respectable will&#xD;
marry her, the matter can be arranged, Count," observed Mrs.&#xD;
Woodruff.&#xD;
" My lady, you are deceived. It is only to pacify the young.&#xD;
lady that Mrs. Parker talks that way I know better.she is&#xD;
not sincere. In a month, the shrewd heartless woman/ will&#xD;
wean the young one from her offspring,. and she will be as'fash-&#xD;
ionable a belle as ever. No one will be the wiser. . So don't&#xD;

fret yourself at all. You have .done with Mrs. Parker. She&#xD;
will never serve you more. You know too much. Now you&#xD;
must make her pay'-pay," said the Count.&#xD;
"But she has paid me," replied the lady.&#xD;
"No, no. She told you she would pay ton thousand dollars&#xD;
to marry, eh'? .But it is a lie. Never mind. I will get five&#xD;
thousand-half for you, lalf for' me," said the Count.&#xD;
"But, my dear Count, she will not stand it. She "-....--&#xD;
" Don't say any more. She will pay 2nze. Write her a note,&#xD;
and say that I am the person who will marry her niece, and that&#xD;
you have told me all. Leae the rest to me."&#xD;
The Count received the sort of note that he desired, and&#xD;
with it he proceeded to the residence of Mrs. Parker. Hie saw&#xD;
that-lady, told her all that she had done, and gave her one day&#xD;
to raise five thousand dollars, or that he would send her and&#xD;
Mr. O'Doemall' to the City Prison. The next day the fright-&#xD;
ened lady had raised the sum, but only about one half in cash;&#xD;
the rest was in jewelry at the Count's valuation, although it&#xD;
had cost Mrs. Parker over six thousand dollars.&#xD;
The Count made some pledges also to that lady. -.She con-&#xD;
tinued at the head of fashion, and hr niece eventually married&#xD;
well-the child having been disposed of in a most mysterious&#xD;
manner, The Count was right in his predictions. Mrs. Parker&#xD;
met Mrs. Woodruff at church, but their acquaintance, socially,&#xD;
was ended.&#xD;
The twenty-five hundred dollars the Count paid over to Mrs.&#xD;
Woodruff, and the jewelry he made a special deposit of at his&#xD;
bankers. It is needless to add that the Count's faithin th e&#xD;
genuine piety and morality of our most fashionable church&#xD;
goers was not'visibly increased.  " I will levy a tax on sin;"&#xD;
said the honorable Count, " wherever I find it.'' lie had done.&#xD;
so with the Parkers to a very heavy extent.&#xD;

been already alluded to; but she had never loved Mr. Nord&#xD;
heim. The duties assumed by her were invariably faithfully&#xD;
and fully performed, and she would have continued to perform'&#xD;
them until her dying day, but she was young, and of a loving&#xD;
disposition. It w'as not until after the death of Mr. Nord.heim&#xD;
that she became aware of the nature of the feelings in her&#xD;
bosom towardslarion Monck. She thought she loved him as&#xD;
a sister. He had been something for her to love for long&#xD;
years. She had became bound up in all his aspirations and&#xD;
his hopes, and his-wishes. He had become a part of herself.&#xD;
There was very little difference in their ages. She was a few&#xD;
months oldev than him-.-that was ,all. When Mr. Nordheim&#xD;
died, the reflections that crossed her mind in reference to her&#xD;
future were of a new and at first a startling character., Then,&#xD;
she began to canvass Marion's conduct, and she concluded in&#xD;
her own mind,- that he must love her or that .it would soon&#xD;
change to love. When Mrs. Granville informed her that&#xD;
Marion loved ;nd was engaged to her niece, her eyes were&#xD;
opened---the veil was lifted fromher most secret thoughts.&#xD;
She knew herself, her weakness, and she determined to con-&#xD;
quer it. .She had no female friend or relative. to consult-but&#xD;
there was one of the other sex that she respected, and felt that&#xD;
she could trust. It was our old friend the bookkeeper, Mr.&#xD;
Wilson. To him, ever since Mr. Nordheim's death, had been&#xD;
confided her vieWs and wishes in reference to the settlement of&#xD;
the affairs of her husband. Those affairs had turned out much&#xD;
better than any one anticipated. It was true- that Mr. Nord-&#xD;
beim lad :been very extravagant, but it was no less true that&#xD;
the firm had been making every year a large amount. Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim's original capital had never been touched. On. the&#xD;
contrary, every year when .the accounts were made up,,Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim had had a considerable sum to his credit upon the&#xD;
books. As soon as this was ascertained, under Mr. Wilson's&#xD;
advice, she had gradually'withdrawn from the concern large&#xD;
sums .at intervals, andthese had been judiciously invested in&#xD;
real estate, and in bank stocks bought in her own name, She&#xD;
was independently riuh. She was aWare of this fact long be-&#xD;
fore she became aware of Marion's ill-fated- attachment. to&#xD;
another, and it is not a cause 'of wonder that she sometimes&#xD;
dreamed that Marion Monck would share it withr her. Poor&#xD;
Marion, little did he dream that. his boyish love for Isabella&#xD;
Granville was to be nipped ifi the bud, and also to deprive&#xD;
him of a fond loving heart and an independent fortune..&#xD;

had been a wife without receiving any of those blessings of&#xD;
Domestic life which she had heard of, and now that the hopes&#xD;
that were just budding in reference to Marion were so cruelly&#xD;
withered, her heart seemed to be crushed.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson came up that evening. She was alone. "Where&#xD;
is Marion to-night ?" he asked.&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheim burst into tears, and made. no reply. Honest,&#xD;
true-hearted Wilson sat down by her side, and tried all in his&#xD;
power to console her, or at least to obtain from her, lips the&#xD;
secret of such bitter tears. As she became more composed,&#xD;
she felt that to have the sympathy, of this cold-hearted busi-&#xD;
ness man was something, and her heart opened to him.&#xD;
! Mr. Wilson, I am ashamed to tell you why I. have wept so&#xD;
bitterly, tut I am sure you will not betray my confidence. I&#xD;
'have had that youth living in the house with me as a brother&#xD;
for so long a time. I thought I only  oved him as a brother,&#xD;
but when my husband, whom    I never loved, died, .1 then&#xD;
awoke to the real state of my feelings--I loved, Marion Monak."&#xD;
And then she, recounted to Mr. Wilson what Mrs. Tom Gran-&#xD;
ville had told her...-' Can it be possfle that it is not so-&#xD;
that he does not love Miss Granville'?  Tell me- truly what&#xD;
you think. I know you will peak the truth," she observed.&#xD;
"Lady, I thank you much for this confidence. It. has not&#xD;
lessened you in my regard. On the contrary, I would do&#xD;
more than ever to serve you. I, too, have become very much&#xD;
attached to Marion. I have no body to love. I work hard for&#xD;
a living. I am poor, for I have saved nothing from my salary&#xD;
for until within a few months I remitted all for the use of an&#xD;
infirm mother and 4 sick sister in England, who had nothing to&#xD;
support them except what I could send," said Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
"You. are a noble -man, Mr. Wilson," interrupted Mrs,&#xD;
Nordheim.&#xD;
" Death has removed my mother, but I still have to aid&#xD;
my sister; but having, as, I said before, nothing to love,&#xD;
I became warmly attached to Marion. I tried all in my power&#xD;
to impart to him all the commercial information which I pos-&#xD;
sessed - I succeeded, for h&amp;amp; is an apt scholar. I have watched&#xD;
him in the office and out of it, and the more I sawof him the&#xD;
more I liked him. When I discovered that therd was. an&#xD;
attachment to Miss Granville, I became alarmed. He neve&#xD;
-informed me of it, but I could not be deceived. I knew that&#xD;
Mr. Granville would not listen a moment to it. He has other&#xD;
views for his daughter. I know from himself what those views&#xD;
are, and you may believe me, Mrs. Nordheim, that I have beeu&#xD;

for months expecting an explosion. It will come sooner or&#xD;
later, for Mr. Granville, when lhe sets his mind .upon any thing,&#xD;
will carry it through or die in, the attempt. You know the&#xD;
history of his son's unfortunate attachment. It was to a heart-&#xD;
less girl, but still, Walter loved her, and .refused to marry&#xD;
Miss Benson, that his father had chosen for him. The conse-&#xD;
quence was, that he became an outcast, and is somewhere in&#xD;
the Pacific Ocean as a sailor before the mast, and I do not&#xD;
think Mr, Granville ever gives him a thought," remarked Mr.&#xD;
Wilson, quietly.&#xD;
But, Mr. Wilson, could nothing be done to remove Mr.&#xD;
Granville's objections?  I would do much for Marion's happi-&#xD;
ness. Were' I to agree to put'a large sum at Marion' disposd&#xD;
to start him in business, would not that remove some of Mr.&#xD;
Granville's scruples ? I would do any thirig-make any sacri-,&#xD;
flee for-him," continued Mrs. Nordheim.&#xD;
"You are a loving, kind-hearted woman to say so, but it&#xD;
would not add a feather to Marion's chances. Nothing that&#xD;
you or I could do would prove of any use. Mr. Granville has&#xD;
made up his mind, surtere it ends. Marion might run away&#xD;
with her, but if he did, he 'ould have her for his pains. Gran-&#xD;
vile would never forgive or see them again in life. On the&#xD;
contrary, he would do all in his power to ruin Marion, and&#xD;
plunge the married couple into deeper misery," replied Mr.&#xD;
Wilson.&#xD;
"What a character he must be ! I never heard of such a&#xD;
man. l-He does not seem to be so iron.-hearted and so stern,"&#xD;
remarked Mrs- Nordheim.&#xD;
"lHe is even worse than I have pictured him to you. Oh, I&#xD;
gnow him well. I have known him long years. Let me offend&#xD;
him to-night, and although I have almost starved my life out,&#xD;
yet le would turn me into the street penniless, and see me&#xD;
starve with as' little remorse as if I was a dog," said Mr. Wil-e&#xD;
son.&#xD;
"My honest friend, I begin to understand you, and I like&#xD;
you more and more Bear this in mind. I find friends are&#xD;
few.. You are a true friend to me, I do believe., If need he,&#xD;
and you want a friend, Mr. Wilson,.come to me at once," and&#xD;
she gave-him her hand, 'which he took, although his own trema-&#xD;
bled.&#xD;
"Nothing, then, can be done in favor of Marion in that quar-&#xD;
ter ?" she continued.&#xD;
" Nothing. lie must take his chances, and they are fearfully&#xD;
against hiin," replied'Mr. WVilson.&#xD;

"'How is it that Mrs. Tom Granville seems to being favqr of&#xD;
the match?  Is it not very queer ?" asked Mrs Nordheim.&#xD;
"It will cost her a home ;.but I believe if her heat waslaid&#xD;
bare, it would be found that she hates her proud .brother-in-&#xD;
law so heartily that she would rather injure or thwart him 'in&#xD;
any purpose that he holds. near at heart, if she sacrifice home&#xD;
and every thing else a woman holds dear,"-replied MrVilson.&#xD;
"Mr. Wilson, tell me what I ought to do., L  annot have&#xD;
Marion Monek live longer in this house.&#xD;
" Is he aware, dear lady, of your secret attachment to&#xD;
him ?" asked Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
" Great God, no! I should die for shame could I think he&#xD;
dared dream of 'such a thing! No. -'No, one but yourself&#xD;
knows it, and I want you to forget it, as I shall endeavor to do.&#xD;
I told you because I need advice.  I do not. know what to do.&#xD;
Ile nust leave the house, but it seems cruel to tell him to go.&#xD;
What will he think of it? How can it be done? Oh, do tell&#xD;
me, Mr. Wilson, and I will be so grateful,'' continued the ex-&#xD;
cited lady.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson thought for several moments, but did not say a&#xD;
word. --At last, as he noticed that.Mrs. Nordheim was waiting&#xD;
for a-reply with the greatest anxiety depicted in her face, he&#xD;
asked, " Do you wish him to leave immediately ?"&#xD;
" Oh at once-to-night if it were possible. I do not want&#xD;
him to remain an hour longer than is absolutely necessary. .I&#xD;
am afraid of myself-that is, I am afraid that something, might&#xD;
occur to Mr. Vilson that would betray my secret.",&#xD;
"Then you must resort to innocent deception.  Do you&#xD;
know any place where you-could go and remain, two or three&#xD;
days ?" asked Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
" Oh yes, at Woodbury.  I was there during the summer&#xD;
the cholera was here-don'tyou remember ?"&#xD;
"Certainly I do. Well, we -fnust send you upthere.' As&#xD;
soon as Marion comes home this evening, say to him pleasant-&#xD;
ly, ' Marion,' you must move to-morrow, for I am going away,&#xD;
and shall probably break up housekeeping.' If he asks when,&#xD;
or where, tell him. If he asks when you are- coming.black--&#xD;
,you don't know.  Let him remove to-morrow with hisAhings.&#xD;
le will find some other place. Once out of the hose, you&#xD;
will have no further trouble," was the sound: advice of Mr.&#xD;
'Wilson.&#xD;
"I will take your advice, but it is hard.  Still: I feelmy-&#xD;
self it must be done.&#xD;
-"Be sure that you place his removing upon that ground&#xD;

Soon after,'Mr. Wilson took his leave.. He had hardly got&#xD;
away from the house before Marion, using his nig  ey, en-&#xD;
tered, and stood before Mrs. Nordheim., She receive  im as&#xD;
cordially as though nothing had happened, and it 'would  ave&#xD;
been hard work to' have made the announcement that night.&#xD;
She felt that she had not the heart to do it.  But he said-&#xD;
"Bessy, I have got to go back to the office to-night for a short&#xD;
time, and shall then spend the balance of the evening at Mr.&#xD;
Granville's, in State street."&#xD;
There was no more delicacy about telling him that she wahs&#xD;
going into the country, and that he must find another home-&#xD;
" at least for a while," she added, as she saw his amazed look,&#xD;
" although I do-not think I shall keep house much longer in&#xD;
the city. I mean to pay a visit to Charleston."&#xD;
"Can' I help you in getting ready' to go in the country ?"&#xD;
"No-.-'you will have enough to do to get your own things&#xD;
ready.,' If I need help I will send down to Mr. Wilson.",&#xD;
"-That is very cold language to use to me."&#xD;
"1Not at all. You will have enough to do, as I sid before,&#xD;
and the sooner you get removed with your things, the sooner,&#xD;
I shall be able to go-and now good night. I have got work&#xD;
to do," and she hastily left the room.&#xD;
.It was this communication, that he mentioned to Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville, who invited him to his house.  The next day Marion&#xD;
went up to Bond street, and before starting ordered a cartman&#xD;
to' meet him there, and to bring down his trunk.  He found&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheim in the parlor.  She half regretted 'her deter-&#xD;
mination. It appeared unkind on her part, and entirely un-&#xD;
necesary. Probably she would .have told. Marion he need not&#xD;
go; but when he arrived, unfortunately for him, 'he exclaimed,&#xD;
"Well, Bessy, I have come for my things, and I am going&#xD;
with them to Mr. Granville's, in State street."&#xD;
I am very glad you have found so pleasant a place. You&#xD;
will find Miss Granville a much more agreeable hostess than&#xD;
you have found me."&#xD;
" No, that cannot be. You have been very kind to me,&#xD;
Bessy."&#xD;
"Well then, get your things in your trunk, for your cart-.&#xD;
man is at the door ready to receive them," and then she hur-&#xD;
ried to her' room and'locked the door. .&#xD;
Marion, when he had packed his trunks, tried to see her, 'but&#xD;

the girl told him her mistress-had too bad a headache and could&#xD;

Mr. Wilson called that evening. She saw him, but her pale&#xD;
cheeks and tearful eyes betrayed that if it had not cost much&#xD;
trouble to get Marion out of the house, it would 'cost her still&#xD;
more to get him out of her heart.&#xD;
"He has gone, has he? I am glad of it; and now will you&#xD;
visit the Connecticut village ?"&#xD;
"No, I believe not. There is no occasion for it, and I am&#xD;
not well."&#xD;
Should Marion call here, what then ?"&#xD;
"I have ordered the servants not to,"let him into the house,&#xD;
and to keep the door locked constantly so that he cannot come&#xD;
in as.of old with the night key, and to say that I am not home.&#xD;
or any thing else they choose. 'I will not see him under any&#xD;
circumstances, at least for a month. By that time I shall" be-&#xD;
come accustomed to his absence, and shall be able fo seehim&#xD;
without any emotion., I am very glad that he is gone. Now,&#xD;
Mr. Wilson, will you do me a favor ?"&#xD;
I will ifI can.&#xD;
*Let one month go by, and then I wish you to remove to&#xD;
this house; will you do it ?"&#xD;
"If you wish it,-I will."&#xD;
" I do wish it."&#xD;
"What will people say?   I do not speak in reference to&#xD;
myself, dear lady, but on your account.&#xD;
" Mr. Wilson, I do not care what people say. I intend' to&#xD;

If you are sick, you have no one to see that you do not'suffer.&#xD;
Now why should 'you not come and take up yourresidence with&#xD;

-True, that is very true, and I feel very much flattered by&#xD;

MAO NEIL    T AsPINWALL struggled bravely to keep on and&#xD;
to recover their losses; but it was all in vain. Both pPtiers&#xD;
lived extravagantly, and Colonel Mac Neil was so"kind-hearted&#xD;
that he could notsay no to any request or solicitation for peOu-&#xD;
niary aid. For some time  after he had made provision for his&#xD;
niistress McPherson and heir two children, both himself and&#xD;
his business partner made every effort to keep fromiailing&#xD;
but as is usual in such cases, they made-matters worse. They_&#xD;
paid two, three, and even five per cent.- a ,nonth to, get their&#xD;
bills receivable cashed. They 'bought goods 'en time, shipped&#xD;
them to different parts of rope, and received cash advances&#xD;
on the same, but it was of no use; Jvery day thatsthisfirm&#xD;
continued to pay their notes, their affairs became n eer-&#xD;
fully involved. At last the day of ruin came. Colonel Nao&#xD;
Neil had been to his office in the morning, and althoughhis&#xD;
partner tried to keep up.good spirits, andspeak encouragingly,&#xD;
Mac Neil asked him " How long isthistate of things go&#xD;
last?"&#xD;
"o, we may get through yet. Todayw ill be a hard day,:ii't&#xD;
Mr.Granville has promised u  breethousand dollarsason&#xD;
and with that we can keep on a week at least; befoe-thatti&#xD;
something will odcur in our favor. Eesp-         od he&#xD;

With suh1 consolation,  e Colonel ieft hislaoeofhiggs&#xD;
visited a few haunts, and then went, and took diner wi h-&#xD;
McPherson and his two little ones. l-e did not leave&#xD;

*ho was quite, surprised at such an exhibition of warm feeling,&#xD;
expressed 'hisregret at what had occurred.&#xD;
"These accidents we are all liable to, but I hope the, mis-&#xD;
fortune will be but temporary."&#xD;
"Really, you must be more explicit; what misfortune do&#xD;
you allude Vto"&#xD;
Colonel MacNeil had not the retpotest idea of what was coming.&#xD;
Why, to your--failure-suspension. It is talked ofui the&#xD;
street. The  otesof your firm have been protested at the&#xD;
iank o-day, Were you not aware of it, Colonel ?",&#xD;
Indeed I was not. Great God ! This is awful! Excuse&#xD;
m   but I-must hurry on ;" and the Colonel did hurry on, He&#xD;
went to his store'. There was a gloomy set of clerks there, but&#xD;
his partner was absent. He 'called his chief clerk on one side.&#xD;
"Ro* is this?  Have our notes bien protested to-dayT&#xD;
askedthe ColoneL&#xD;
4I am sorry tosay that it is too true. Mr. Aspinwall was&#xD;
to have received some money from. Mr. Granville, but only a&#xD;
few moments before the Banks closed, he declined lending us&#xD;
thiemoney. There was no time to remedy, and Mae Neil and,&#xD;
AsPin wallhave failed;'"&#xD;

perhaps it i as well now as at a later period. Can you .giv&#xD;

upon his bed, but he could not sleep. He walked the room,&#xD;
btit brought no relief to the, deep agony of his mind. He,&#xD;
was east down; his commercial name was blasted. "I hall&#xD;
neer rise again."&#xD;
'The Coloneiwas an honorable man. -e met his partner the&#xD;
next day, and they agreed to give up every thing-to assign&#xD;
all the property that they heldjointly or individually. - "Leave&#xD;
me only my' clothes, and I shall feel happy in giving up every&#xD;
thing else?" said the'Colonel. Some'of the creditors proposed&#xD;

"For some time, at least, I have a pretty. sure source of in-&#xD;

Of course they will, and be glad to do 'it when thy are&#xD;

tions from me at different times, in all I believe amounting to&#xD;
over five hundred dollars. Now is the time that I nteed it re-&#xD;
funded, and I hope you will not be backward," observed Col-&#xD;
onel Mac Neil.&#xD;
"y dear Colonel, if you knew how I was situated. I&#xD;
haven't a dollar to keep myself with. I thought to get some&#xD;
from you, knowing that you had failed, and had no mo're notes&#xD;
to pay. I felt sure that you bad plenty of money, and I was&#xD;
going to ask- ou to lend ime a hundred," said O'Doemall.&#xD;
O'Doemal, I believe you are a precious rascal, and I will&#xD;
expose you unless you pay me some portion of what is so justly,&#xD;
my due."&#xD;
"Expose me ? Wby, Mac, you must be .joking! If I owe&#xD;
anybody, it is your creditors. You say that you have not as-&#xD;
signed in your schedule what I owe you, and therefore I think&#xD;
if you make any stir about it, you are more likely to expose&#xD;
yourself."&#xD;
"Leave the room on the instant, or by -    .  Go, go!&#xD;
Don't make me put my hands upon you, oiit will be the worse&#xD;
for both of us," exclaimed the Colonel.&#xD;
"Why, Mac, you are as cross as a bear; but I will leave&#xD;
you now, and see you some time when you are better matured,"&#xD;
said O'Doema'll.&#xD;
. "Scoundrel, if you ever dare to speak .to me' again, under&#xD;
any circumstauoes, I will break your head ! Begone !" aid&#xD;
Colonel Mac Neil, sternly.4&#xD;
Mr. O'Doemall was somewhat alarmed, and made a precipi-&#xD;
tate retreat.&#xD;
"Perhaps Aspinwall was right, and I shall not be able to&#xD;
collect a dollar from my fair weather friends," thought the&#xD;
Colonel. Colonel Mae Neil was not to be an exception -to the&#xD;
general rule, that when one meets with misfortune, all hope&#xD;
of fair weather friends is gone. He tried several of those who&#xD;
owed him money---honestly owed him borrowed money. Not&#xD;
a dollar could he get froxthem, and 'from those friends who&#xD;
did not owe him he was 'too proud to ask a favor. So days&#xD;
passed on, and poor lMc Neil found his position'hanged. He,&#xD;
was still.a gentleman--still could be amusing, and when 'he&#xD;
frequented old hiunts, he met with some who at least' could.&#xD;
aord to stand' a treat. There was one soiree of consolation&#xD;
yet to the broken down man, for he was completely- broken&#xD;
down.' After his failure, he began to drink to excess. His&#xD;
eye-sight, never good,.partially gave way. 'This source-of comn-&#xD;
for't was in the quiet tgo story house in 'liarrison street. -IEo&#xD;

&#xD;
had provided for those three ,dar ones, and-'they could not&#xD;
want.&#xD;
Miss McPherson tried to make the Colonel take up his home&#xD;
there. It was in vain.  She urged her deep and tender love,&#xD;
and offered to place at his disposal the income which was com-&#xD;
ing in quarterly with regularity. No-he was too' prud to&#xD;
accept that ; or perhaps it' was a better..-a still- biher motive.&#xD;
"Urge me not, Jane, to any meanness of the kind. - I have&#xD;
found by? bitter experience what it is to be without money.-&#xD;
You nor the children shall not have such experience.  Come&#xD;
what will, even if I die in the alms-house, I will not break for&#xD;
an instant upon yours and the children's means. If I thought&#xD;
that I could be persuaded to do so I would-go- to my room and&#xD;
blow out my brains. No, no. Let me come and see you occa-&#xD;
sionally, see the little ones happy, and that is all I wish-I&#xD;
shall get along somehow or-other," was his reply.&#xD;
His mistress knew his determined character, and that it&#xD;
would be useless to attempt to interfere with his determina'-&#xD;
tion. She was a woman of' sound sense also, and 'loved 'her&#xD;
children.  She looked to the future for them alone, and know-&#xD;
ing that the provision the Colonel had secured to her and them&#xD;
would be but a drop to him with his extravagant habits, she&#xD;
forbore to urge his taking the income. So Colonel, Mac Neil&#xD;
travelled the world almost alone... He was no longer invited&#xD;
to parties or dinners, and he withdrew from fashiorable socie-&#xD;
ty. At last he found he could not keep a room, or hoard at&#xD;
the City Hotel. He paid his -bill and removed; he told no one&#xD;
where he was going. He had an old-fashioned- bureau. that&#xD;
had belonged to his father-that and his trunk were' all his&#xD;
baggage. The cartman that he employed was a strange one,&#xD;
and could not be found after he had removed the Colonel's&#xD;
things. Could one of those fashionable associates have followed&#xD;
Mac, or found him within a week after he left the City .Hotel,&#xD;
it would have been in a small, badly-furnished room in a little&#xD;
tenement in Cross, near Pearl street. There was he and his&#xD;
trunks, and he had made an arrangement with the-proprietor&#xD;
that he could have that room for a dollar a week, or 'fifty 'dol-&#xD;
lars' per annum. The bureau was too large for the room but&#xD;
the landlord had-also a store only a few doors from 'his-hiouse.&#xD;
It was in Centre street, and eXtended through from Centre to&#xD;
Cross, only a few doors from Pearl.  He had been a porter in'&#xD;
the Colonel's store in former days, and had got upto be pro-&#xD;
pnietor of a three cent grog shop., It "was in the rear' of' this&#xD;
store that Mac had his bureau. Harry' Mercer; the propri-&#xD;

etor., was much grieved when Mac told him his situation, but&#xD;
Mac would accept no favors. He was grateful for a home.&#xD;
where his poverty would not he exposed, and' where it came&#xD;
within his means. Harry Mercer was glad to have Mac there.&#xD;
The bureau took up but little room, and was'placed near the&#xD;
rear door.- The store was always open at daylight, and Colo-&#xD;
nel Mac Neil soon after came, opened his bureau, proceeded to&#xD;
shave himself, and after half an hour would be ready to go to&#xD;
take his morning draught.  Jemmy the clerk had a bottle. of&#xD;
rather choice brandy which was kept exclusively for Mac's own&#xD;
use. Then he would deliberately read the paper with as much&#xD;
satisfaction as when he was spending twenty thousand dollars&#xD;
a year. His old porter respected him and his dignified ap-&#xD;
pearance, for he was scrupulously neat, andhis intelligent con-&#xD;
versation made him respected by the regular customers of the&#xD;
store, who it is needless to say, were a new set of acquaint-&#xD;
ances.&#xD;
Colonel Mac Neil was a'king-pin among these new people.&#xD;
When he had read the morning papers, he went and procured&#xD;
breakfast somewhere, and then returned.  At about eleven&#xD;
o'clock, the same hour that he used to show himself to his&#xD;
fashionable friends, the Colonel would go up to Washington&#xD;
lHall, down in Barclay street, or some other well known resort,&#xD;
where he could mix freely but independently with the old set.&#xD;
le would generally be asked to dine by some of the young,&#xD;
bucks, who felt honored by his- acceptance of the invitation.&#xD;
The afternoon would .be spent in dining and finishing ,soine&#xD;
wine. Then the Colonel would return to the store,.and sit and&#xD;
chat with his Centre street acquaintances more sociably than&#xD;
with the Broadway set  They were delighted with him, and&#xD;
there were no end of drinks. About once a week, as it reached&#xD;
nine clock, the Colonel would say,&#xD;
"1Harry, let me hay.e ten dollars."&#xD;
"Certainly," would be the smiling reply 'of the one called&#xD;
Harry.&#xD;
With this money placed in his pocket book he would go to,&#xD;
some of his old gambling haunts. He rarely lost.  Fortune&#xD;
favored him on alniost every occasion. He would not abuse or&#xD;
tire her ladyship. He bought his chips, and calmly played&#xD;
them until his earnings reached twenty or sometimes fifty&#xD;
dollars. .Then he stopped and would play no more,.partake of&#xD;
alight supper, and go to his-solitary room.&#xD;
In the morning, when Mercer opened his store, Mac would&#xD;
hand him all, reserving ten: dollars perhaps. This sum *as to&#xD;
&#xD;
be used to give the Colonel the very luxury of happiness. He&#xD;
would forget his usual routine when such a white day chanced,&#xD;
and be off for a large grocery, on the corner of Church _and&#xD;
Canal streets. .There he would order an old cheese, a few&#xD;
pounds of the best tea, a. loaf of sugar, and a few choice&#xD;
things -as many as he could carry, and these he would carry&#xD;
himself to No. 27 Harrison street, and there would be a merry&#xD;
time of it.&#xD;
How queer it is that when rich, or with plenty of money,&#xD;
the most sensible men have no idea how far and how much&#xD;
happiness a very small sum will sometimes confer. Colonel&#xD;
Mae Neil never spent ten thousand dollars with half the per-&#xD;
sonal satisfaction to himself that these ten dollars would give.&#xD;
le always took care that there should be some silver left, to&#xD;
purchase whatever the children used most to desire.&#xD;
These were happy days to the Colonel. le was independent&#xD;
too. He was not drawing upon their little source of income.&#xD;
l e did not frequent the gambling saloons with any regular*%&#xD;
ity. He went there for a purpose. He had lost large sums'&#xD;
there. lie went to wiu back-enough, as he said, to keep him&#xD;
afloat  He played coolly and with skill. If the game was faro,&#xD;
- he played small until all the cards were out but one. Then it&#xD;
was a fair bet, and his chance of winning was upon a par with&#xD;
the bank.. If lie lost his capital of ten dollars which he invari-&#xD;
ably took with him frora Mercer, he played no more.  Some-&#xD;
times a person who had known him would give him fifty dollars&#xD;
to play on shares. Then the Colonel would generally win, but&#xD;
as soon as his share reached fifty dollars, he would play no&#xD;
more, but go to his little lodgings in Cross street, and the next&#xD;
morning add it to his pile in Wilson's bands.&#xD;
There was another curious trait in Mac Neil's character.-&#xD;
Whenever he got a considerable sum,.say a hundred dollars,&#xD;
in Mercer's hands, he would say,&#xD;
"Harry, give me a receipt for fifty dollars for one year's&#xD;
lodgings."&#xD;
Mercer would give it without comment, and take the fifty.&#xD;
Now that leaves fifty dollars"---or sixty, as the case might&#xD;
be-" in your hands ; is it not so ?" asked the Colonel.&#xD;
"Yes, Colonel; but are you aware that you have already&#xD;
paid me for three years' lodging at fifty dollars a year, as we&#xD;
agreed ?" replied Mr. Mercer.&#xD;
Oh yes, I am perfectly aware of it, and I mean to be on&#xD;
the safe side and be ahead for some years. ~You are rising in&#xD;

&#xD;
the world; money is of use to you now.  I look ahead, and&#xD;
am trying to provide good lodgings, eh ?"'added the Oolonel.&#xD;
On other occasions when his luck would 'be good and he had&#xD;
*a surplus in Mr. Wilson's hands, he would go and pay for a&#xD;
suit of clothes ahead. Again, he would pay for quite a bill of&#xD;
useful articles which he knew. Mrs. McPherson or her children&#xD;
needed. She, poor honest woman, asked no questions, but,&#xD;
made up her mind, that from some cause or other, the Colonel&#xD;
spent more money on her and her children, without an in.&#xD;
come, than he had ever done while he was rich. But Colonel&#xD;
Mac Neil in poverty days never got entirely broke. He always&#xD;
had something to fall back upon.  He dressed better, seemed&#xD;
happier, and was more so, than in his proudest days.  Some.&#xD;
times a gentleman, who had means restored him, would pay&#xD;
back the Colonel what he owed him. On one occasion he re.-&#xD;
teived/from such a source eight hundred dollars. He laughed&#xD;
in his sleeve-I don't want it now. lie made Jane McPherson&#xD;
add it to the sum already in the Savings Bank.&#xD;
Mac Neil began to feel the value of money.&#xD;

Ouu readers may deem that we have neglected the family&#xD;
of.Marion Monck, as rarely has an allusion been made to them.&#xD;
Not so, however. He was the all of his parents, and not a&#xD;
week passed but thathe both wrote and heard from them. He&#xD;
was very careful to remit them all his surplus money, from&#xD;
month to quarter--and as he received a very liberal salary,&#xD;
amounting to eight hundred dollars, and his expenses being&#xD;
very light, his remittances during the year amounted to a&#xD;
considerable sum. He was devotedly attached to his parents,&#xD;
and hehad very correct views of. his relations-to them. He&#xD;
felt that until he was of age, theyI had a right to what he&#xD;
could earn above paying his own personal expenses.. These'&#xD;
'were rendered very light in consequence of the liberality of&#xD;
Mr. and, Mrs.. Nordheim, while he lived with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Count Falsechinski on one occasion asked him what he&#xD;
did with all his money-" You can't possibly spend your mo-&#xD;
ney. "  Maion replied,&#xD;
"6I do not; Count, but I send it home to my parents I do&#xD;
not want more than I can use."&#xD;
"That is all very fine, but if you saved up your salary you&#xD;
could speculate a little, and add to it. What are you going to&#xD;
do for capital by and bye, when you want to go into business?&#xD;
Now I have got a pretty considerable capital in the hands of&#xD;
my bankers, Prime, Ward &amp;amp; King, and it is growing.'.'&#xD;
Marion said he was very glad to hear it, and. added,&#xD;
"But why, Count, are you so anxious to get money?"&#xD;
"Ah, Marion, you, have seen me when I was very, very&#xD;
ppor. It is bad to be poor. You have been my good angel.&#xD;
You brought me luck-you have made a new man of me. I&#xD;
will never forget you, Marion.  I would die for you,.  I will&#xD;
prove my gratitude to you some day. ''You don'tneed my aid&#xD;
now. You will some day. I am making money.   I work for&#xD;
it night and day. I have a fixed'pu-rpose; never mind what&#xD;
it is; and that reminds me that I have got a note from my&#xD;
bankers to come around there-so good bye."&#xD;
The Count went to Wall street to his bankers; when he&#xD;
reached there lie was..ushered into one of the inner offices,&#xD;
where he found the head of the firm.&#xD;
Oount, good morning. I have sent for you to, tell you&#xD;
that if you choose to place your money out under my direction&#xD;
t "will pay you better than the five per cent which is all we&#xD;
can allow you," said old Mr. Prime, the headof the house.&#xD;
Reallyi-Mr. Prime, .you are very good.  Will you point&#xD;
out to me a mode, and I shall follow your advice. I have fouid&#xD;
it of great service heretofore," said the Count.&#xD;
"Buy real estate up-town--it will advance very rapidly. It&#xD;
is the only certain way toimake and keep money in New York.&#xD;
Real estate don't run away. It will always, rise. It will keep&#xD;
going up as long as there is an acre of unoccupied ground on&#xD;
Manhattan island. Every dollar that a man'don't require he&#xD;
,should invest in real estate. If he does so, he will be im-&#xD;
mensely rich some day. I have heard you say-that you shall&#xD;
not' require your money in some years; is it so ?" asked the&#xD;
old banker.&#xD;
"You are right-it is so," replied the Couut.&#xD;
Then take my.adviceand buy real estate.  I know.of some&#xD;
property up town that can be~ bought for a hundred .thousand&#xD;

dollars.  I advise you to let ,me.order it for you," said Mr.&#xD;
Prime.&#xD;
"But, my dear Mr. Prime, I have no such sum of money-&#xD;
nothing like it," replied the Count.&#xD;
The banker smiled as he replied, "Nor need you to have.&#xD;
It only requires about twenty per cent to be paid in- cash, and,&#xD;
the rest can remain on bond and mortgage for five years. Be-&#xD;
fore that time expires it may do to sell, or hold still longer--&#xD;
it will double in value, I have no doubt."&#xD;
The Count did not hesitate a moment. He knew nothing of&#xD;
what'he was doing, but his confidence in the stout solid old&#xD;
gentleman was unbounded. He requested him to order the&#xD;
purchase made. Mr. Prime replied,&#xD;
' I will do so. You need not trouble your head. My firm&#xD;
will employ a lawyer to examine titles, draw up papers, and&#xD;
fix it all up. We will pay the twenty per cent, and charge it&#xD;
to your account. You will do well, 'Count."&#xD;
The old banker was flattered by the confidence shown in,&#xD;
Lim, and the' promptness with which the Count agreed to take&#xD;
his advice-and that old man was a shrewd, wise old man in&#xD;
every way. He never led anybody astray. It was the time&#xD;
when real estate began to take that great rise which has been&#xD;
the means of making many immense fortunes. It was just at&#xD;
the commencement of that rise when nearly a thousand lots of&#xD;
25X100 feet each were bought for the Count at a pricetinside&#xD;
one hundred dollars a lot.&#xD;
It was but a few days after this conversation that this heavy,&#xD;
purchase was made by order of Mr. Prime.  The- Count said&#xD;
iot a word to any one except one. He had no sooner got out&#xD;
of the- banker's office than he hurried up to Broome street to&#xD;
the residence of Miss Norris. She was at home, and for -a&#xD;
wonder was alone. Tom Granville was not to be seen.&#xD;
She appeared glad to see the Count, and asked. him a varie-&#xD;
ty of questions; to all of which he 'replied promptly. Then he&#xD;
said,'&#xD;
" Now Clara, I owe you a good turn. You have once placed&#xD;
me in the way of making money.  I came up this morning to&#xD;
do thewsame for you. I can tell you how .you can more than&#xD;
double your-money, and be safe too. I know that you have&#xD;
saved up at least three thousand dollars." ~&#xD;
"Four thousand, Count-four. But I have not a entleft;&#xD;
it is all gone," replied Miss Norris.&#xD;
" Great God'! Clara, I am amazed. That Tom 'Granvillk,&#xD;
I suppose," observed the Count.&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
Why, Count Falsechinski, how perfectly horrified you do&#xD;
look. But I have not told you all. I have not only spent the&#xD;
four thousand dollars, which includes the legacy of five hun-&#xD;
dred left me by Mr. Nordheim, my lately respected friend, but&#xD;
I have run in debt two thousand more, which I must go to&#xD;
work and earn money to pay off. Tom Granville, I assure you,&#xD;
my dear Count, had no more to do with my wilful extravagance&#xD;
than you had," said Miss Norris.&#xD;
"Wilful extravagance ! Really, Miss Norris, k am  sur-&#xD;
prised. I feel some interest in your.future, and I grieve to&#xD;
say that I am'distressed to hear you confess you have acted so&#xD;
imprudently. I gave you credit for a stronger mind--.but'it&#xD;
can't -be helped " said the vexed Count.&#xD;
Count, you have never given me more credit than I de-&#xD;
-  serve, and don't let me have your contempt for a ,moment.&#xD;
Hear me.   I have parted with my money, that you know I&#xD;
placed in bank for safe keeping, and where it was drawing in-&#xD;
terest. Count, you know that I was sold, -or sold, myself to&#xD;
Nordhcim for the sum of five hundred dollars, and that Uhe&#xD;
money went to my parents. I have also a brother and sister.&#xD;
That money probably saved my father from a drunkard's fate,&#xD;
and my mother and her children from degradation or a county&#xD;
porhouse. If there is any place we love it is the place where&#xD;
we were born-if there is any ambition in the world, it is to&#xD;
stand well with those among whom we are born. 1t-dOn't&#xD;
matter where we go-what we do-how great' our success may&#xD;
be in tlie wide world, we do not value our good fortune fully,&#xD;
unless it raises us with those in our little village, among those&#xD;
where we were born. - Now, Count, have patience.  I have&#xD;
not squandered my money, but I will tell you what I have&#xD;
done with it. For years I have been of service to my parents&#xD;
-since I am in New York I have helped them  all I could.&#xD;
L'stsummer I was up in Sussex county, and spent 'a week&#xD;
with them in their somewhat comfortale home. I then learned&#xD;
that a very valuable farm,, containing some three hundred&#xD;
acres, with good dwelling, barn, out-houses, &amp;amp;e. was for sale.&#xD;
It almost adjoined my old hoiostead, and was considered.' a&#xD;
great dairy farm. Luckily I met with a-lawyer in that region&#xD;
who was always partial to me.   I told him I wished to buy&#xD;
that farm for my father and mother to live upon.  I informed&#xD;
him also that I had four thousand dollars in cash.  The- pice&#xD;
asked was eight thousand dollars, but 'it was to be sold at auc-&#xD;
tion in the course of a few weeks, and the terms were half&#xD;
cash and half in five.yiears. I returned to New "fork, mnado&#xD;

my 'arrangements, got my money out of the Savings Bank, and&#xD;
took it up to Sussex, and deposited it in the Sussex Bank, and&#xD;
waited patiently for the day of sale. I said nothing to my pa-&#xD;
rents. I instructed my lawyer what to do. The sale day came,&#xD;
and my lawyer, Mr..Thompson, bought the farm for six thousand&#xD;
dollars. I paid more than half cash, and have five years to&#xD;
pay the other two thousand, and an interest which only, amounts&#xD;
to one hundred and twenty dollars. You may imagine how my&#xD;
parents felt. You cannot conceive my happiness, Count.. It&#xD;
was happiness."&#xD;
"You have raised yourself much in my opinion.  You hold&#xD;
tde titles of this farm in your own name ?" inquired the Count.&#xD;
"Entirely. My father has enough to stock it pretty well. I&#xD;
don't expect it to pay me- an interest until it is paid for, but it&#xD;
will be a home for them for life, and it may be of great value&#xD;
to me some day. Now I shall sleep easy. The farm had been&#xD;
allowed to run down. It is well worth, fifty dollars an acre,&#xD;
and can be. made worth that, -My father is a good farmer. In&#xD;
his hands' he will make its value increase," replied Miss Nor-&#xD;
fis.&#xD;
"I hope you will succeed in all you undertake, Miss Clara;&#xD;
and perhaps in this matter you have done more for your inter-&#xD;
est than what I *had to propose. At any rate you have shown&#xD;
yourself a good, amiable'child, and you have made yourself&#xD;
happy y doing a good action. *How.is Master Tom ?" asked.&#xD;
the Count.&#xD;
'I have not seen him, Count, since morning," replied Clara.&#xD;
" Are you aware that his wife has been on to Baltimore and&#xD;
employed a distinguished lawyer to get a divorce for her from&#xD;
her husband?"&#xD;
"  was not aware of it andl I do not think Tom knew any&#xD;
thing about- it.' Well, she will get the divorce without any&#xD;
trouble, for I believe Tom will not contest the matter. How&#xD;
did you hear.of it ?" inquired Miss 'Norris.&#xD;
"From her brother-Alaw," replied the Count.&#xD;
"Why, Count, perhaps she is anxious to get a divorce from&#xD;
T.om to set her cap for you?" laughingly observed Miss Norris.&#xD;
"My good Clara'.she has got no money, and I cannot marry&#xD;
anybody who has not got plenty of money-money that brings&#xD;
in an income-property that gives such a sum every year.&#xD;
Then a man is a man, and can be 'a gentl'matn even in this&#xD;
country, if he has a-fixed allowance.- I want at least an income&#xD;
oI twelve thousand dollars a year. Then I shall feel easy-&#xD;

&#xD;
not until then. I will have it some day, Miss Clara. Nous&#xD;
verrons," observed the excited Count.&#xD;
"Ah, Count, you have some secret that I cannot fathom;&#xD;
but perhaps you will tell me some day what it is,"observed&#xD;
Miss Norris.&#xD;
" I must leave you now, and I wish you a good day. The&#xD;
more I thiik of it, the more I am pleased with your purchase&#xD;
of that farm,".said the Count.&#xD;
The. Count returned to his humble lodgings' in John street.&#xD;
It is not exactly in place to tell here the result of the real&#xD;
estate operations made by the Count Falsechinski, at the sug-&#xD;
gestion of old Mr. Prime, but it may be as well told here as&#xD;
any where else. For the moment the purchase was made, real&#xD;
estate began to rise rapidly. Lots sold one day at a certain&#xD;
price, were re-sold again the next day almost for double, and a&#xD;
third, fourth and fifth sales were made within a very few days&#xD;
at the most extravagant prices. The lots purchased by the&#xD;
Cpunt Falsechinski were in about what would be now the lower,&#xD;
part of the oity. They comprised a large vegetable garden.&#xD;
Not many weeks after the papers were all duly signed and&#xD;
the money paid, the Count -,was again sent for "by old Mr.&#xD;
Prime. He went to the old banker's office. 'Mr. Prime said,&#xD;
"Count, you can get two hundred dollars a lot for your lots.&#xD;
Do you wish to sell ?"&#xD;
The Count was amazed, and he replied, perfectly cool-.&#xD;
"What do you advise, Mr. Prime?1"&#xD;
"Wait. The fever has not yet got full headway."&#xD;
"I will do as you advise," and the Count' went back to his&#xD;
clerkly duties' in the office of Mr., Granville, who knew no' more&#xD;
of the Count's transaction with the banker than he did, of the&#xD;
world of spirits.. Not many weeks more elapsed before the&#xD;
Count received a note asking him to dine with the great banker&#xD;
at'his country seat near iHurlgate. The Count, accepted the&#xD;
invitation, and at three o'clock took a seat in the  arrie of&#xD;
the banker. ..When they were on-the way up, old Mr. 'rie&#xD;
ordered his coachman to drive' to the 'garden, which was, in&#xD;
reality, the property of the Count. He pointed out its ad-van-&#xD;
tages, and prophesied that 'ere many years -it would be coy-&#xD;
ered with palatial. residences. The rid6 was a delightful one.&#xD;
The dinneer was excellent, the Count was. introduced to the&#xD;
banker's' family, and he in his turn made hiuiself uncommonly&#xD;
agreeable. That night he slept in the house of his ho4itable&#xD;
entertainer, as it was too late to go' into' the city. After the&#xD;
breakfast was concluded the next morning, the old banker re-&#xD;

marked, as though it was not of much consequence, "Count,&#xD;
your lots have gone' up 'to three hundred dollars. You can get&#xD;
that for every one of them; I I think the fever has reached a,&#xD;
crisis. I advise you-to sell. You can get one half cash. That,&#xD;
is one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. You owe eighty&#xD;
thousand dollars mortgage. Take eighty thousand dollars out,&#xD;
of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and buy the mort-&#xD;
gage, Count. Then you will have a first mortgage-for one hun..&#xD;
dred and fifty thousand dollars,' bringing seven per cent. in-&#xD;
terest and seventy thousand dollars in cash.  The mortgage&#xD;
has to run five years. Perhaps atIthat time it will be down,&#xD;
and you can foreclose and get your property back again."&#xD;
It all happened as the old financier prophesied. The Count&#xD;
sold out his real estate, the thousand lots, paid the mortgage&#xD;
of eighty thousand dollars, had seventy thousand dollars in his,&#xD;
banker's hands, and a mortgage of one hundred and fifty thou.&#xD;
and dollars drawing seven per cent interest, and 'one of the&#xD;
- best'possible investments. We now return to the regular nar-&#xD;
rative and to the moment when the Count returned to his John&#xD;
street humble quarters.&#xD;

Sducer--Scareer-of Vadainy-The Due --An Anecdote of Rascality-The&#xD;
World's Opinion.&#xD;
THE old citizens of New York must well recollect what a&#xD;
place of resort the Battery was twenty-five years ago. Then,&#xD;
most of the adjoining blocks were made up of handsome dwell-&#xD;
ing-houses, and they were 'occupied by our wealthiest mer-&#xD;
chants and most respectable people. The hotel now on the&#xD;
corner of Broadway and Battery Place at that time was the&#xD;
city residence of-Ild Mr. Prime, of whom we have spoken. Or&#xD;
an afternoon the Battery was crowded with children taccom-&#xD;
panied by their parents, or sometimes only by their nurses.&#xD;
Young ladies of the first respectability took their morning or&#xD;
afternoon-walks unattended., No outrage was ever known or,&#xD;
dreaded of. What a contrast with the dirty, filthy Battery of&#xD;
the present day, when it is almost as much as a. man's life is&#xD;
worth to go 'upon the BatterIy, and a female could not walk&#xD;
across it without being grossly insulted. In losing the bat-&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
tery, New Yorkers lost one of the iost invigorating and health-&#xD;
ful promenades in the city.4 No uptown park or square can be-&#xD;
gin to compare with it.&#xD;
It was a custom of Marion Monck, after he removed to' Mr.&#xD;
Granville's house, to rise early in the morning and go out upon&#xD;
the Battery for -a stroll. He was generally accompanied by&#xD;
Isabella Granville, and these occasions were seized upon: to&#xD;
converse with all the sincerity of a young attacliment upon&#xD;
their future hopes of happiness. It was a very difficult matter&#xD;
for Isabella to persuade Marion, who -detested, concealment,&#xD;
to keep from her parent the real state of matters. But she did&#xD;
succeed in doing so, and although Mr. Granville could see&#xD;
them walkig upon the Battery from his widows, yet.it never&#xD;
crossed his mind for a moment that there was the- slightest&#xD;
danger /to the peace of mind of his daughter from such an in-&#xD;
tercourse. One beautiful morning, while Marion and Isabella&#xD;
wete proenading what is called the lovers' walk, they were&#xD;
met by Miss Benson. Isabella and the latter lady ernbraced&#xD;
each other affectionately, and Bell insisted that Margaret&#xD;
should-join them, and then go and take a breakfast. Miss.Ben-&#xD;
son agreed to promenade with them, but positively refused to&#xD;
go to the house afterwards. "I don't like Aunt late, Isabella,&#xD;
and my feelings are fully reciprocated, I am well aware."&#xD;
They then had been walking up and down sevei'al times, and&#xD;
finally took the outer walk nearest the water. The young la.&#xD;
dies noticed some boat off in the river, and stopped, watching&#xD;
its motion; while doing so, both leaned over the wooden fence&#xD;
or railing. Marion stopped in his walk, and was waiting- for&#xD;
his two companions to proceed, when a gentleman walked up&#xD;
to him and asked him if he was not Mr. Monck.&#xD;
"I am," was the reply.&#xD;
"My name, sir, is Gaillard."&#xD;
In an.instant Marion recognized him, for he had seen -him&#xD;
twice at the time Mr; Nordheim was injured at the Qpera&#xD;
House.&#xD;
"I am glad to meet you, sir  You have been absent from&#xD;
town since-.since "-&#xD;
o"   know what you would say. Yes, sir. I have been home&#xD;
to South Carolina. By the way, you are from my- own State.&#xD;
I heard of you frequently in -harleston." Marion bowed and&#xD;
replied,&#xD;
,  Yes, sir; I am also from that State."&#xD;
Here the two' young ladies seemed ready to walk again. Ma--&#xD;

rion wished to ask Mr. Gaillard some further questions, and be&#xD;
at once presented him to both ladies.&#xD;
"Will you walk with, us, sir ?" inquired Marion.&#xD;
Mr. Gaillard consented willingly, and each took the outside&#xD;
of the two ladies, Mr. Gaillard on the side of Miss Benson.&#xD;
The conversation became general and very interesting.  Mr.&#xD;
Gaillard told of many matters that had occurred in South Car-&#xD;
olina, (for it was when nullification had a foothold in that&#xD;
State) which wer'e entirely-new to Marion. Finally Miss Ben.&#xD;
son, who had been looking at Mr. Gaillard very earestly,&#xD;
ceased walking and said. "I am sure.I ani not mistaken. Why,&#xD;
you are thegentleman that kil---that injured Mr. Nordheim."&#xD;
Mr. Gaillard bowed and said, "I am that unfortunate per..&#xD;
Unfortunate," repeated the lady. "I do not know ;why&#xD;
you should call yourself unfortunate. You acted bravely, and*&#xD;
protected your sister from insult as a gallant gentleman should&#xD;
do. I like you all the better for that. affair, and I assure you&#xD;
that I consider myself. highly honored by forming .your ac-&#xD;
quaintance- Marion, I am really much' obliged to you. What&#xD;
do you say, Miss Isaboila'?"&#xD;
I am pleased to make Mr. Gaillard's acquaintance.  I&#xD;
thought I had seen him before, but I could not remember&#xD;
when and where., You werepointed out to me that dreadful&#xD;
night. I almost hear the scream that Mr. Nordheim gave. But&#xD;
I never blamed you. Even my father, sir, said you did per-&#xD;
fectly right."&#xD;
Mr. Gaillard bowed again, and made some inquiries after Mr.&#xD;
Granville, whomshe said he met at the hospital the day Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim died.&#xD;
"It is about time, Miss Tsabel, for us to go home to our&#xD;
breakfast. I see the girl is waving a handkerchief en the steps&#xD;
as  signal. Will you go with us, sir ?"&#xD;
"I must decline. I am placed rather delicately... Remem-&#xD;
ber Mr. Nordheim was Mr. Granville's partner, and my pres-&#xD;
ence may bring unpleasant memories to him,' answered Mr.&#xD;
Gaillard.&#xD;
"Ohi" exclaimed Miss Benson; "don't decline on that ac.&#xD;
count. Mr. Granville is not so excruciatingly sensitive as all&#xD;
thut' comes to. So long as yoihad not killed him,- he don't&#xD;
care. I rather think he was very much obliged to you for giv-s&#xD;
ingMNordheim that blow."&#xD;
" Miss;Benson, how can 'you -speak in that 'manner~ of -my&#xD;
father ? It is very un ind of you. Well, if you will not ac- .&#xD;
&#xD;
185&#xD;
&#xD;
company us, Miss -Bensoi nor you, Mr. Gailard, 6. must go&#xD;
home without you.&#xD;
'$If Miss Benson will permit me to.continue t be her 'es-&#xD;
cort, I sha1 be quite happy," said Mr. Gaillard.&#xD;
",Very happy, indeed; and if you will escort me as far as my&#xD;
home, I ahall be happy to have you take breakfast with my&#xD;
good folks. My worthy papa is rather disposed to like you,&#xD;
and as you are from the next State to the one in which my&#xD;
mother was born, she will be charmed to meet you. So good-&#xD;
bye, Bell. Good morning, Marion."&#xD;
Mutual good-byes were exchanged, and while Marion re-&#xD;
turned to No.  State street with Isabella, Mr. Gaillard and&#xD;
Miss Benson continued on up Broadway.&#xD;
"Miss Benson, I consider myself one of the most fortunate&#xD;
of h4dividuals, in' becoming personally acquainted with you this&#xD;
morni.ig. I have desired to know you for a longer period than&#xD;
you are aware of.  I first noticed you that night at the Opera.&#xD;
I have since frequently met you, and I hope you will excuse -&#xD;
my frankness when I say that it had 'not been with .the% hope&#xD;
of being introduced to you, I should not have made' myself&#xD;
known to Mr. Monck."&#xD;
"-Indeed," replied Miss Benson, "I feel extremely flattered.&#xD;
I certainly could not have supposed for a moment that Mr.&#xD;
Gaillard was aware such a person as Margaret Benson was in&#xD;
existence until this morning."&#xD;
The couple continued the conversation until they reached&#xD;
the residence of Colonel Benson. It was with some difficulty&#xD;
that Miss Benson perAsuaded the young South Carolinian to&#xD;
enter her father's residence at so unusual an hour, but she.suc-&#xD;
ceeded, and het happy nianner of making-him acquainted with&#xD;
her parents and her brother, soon' made him perfectly at his&#xD;
ease, Mr. Benson was glad of an opportunity to talk' about&#xD;
the Souih, and the Colonel, it would almost appear, was de-&#xD;
lighted at meeting thegentlemian who had so opportunely rid&#xD;
the world of Nordheim.&#xD;
"It was really quite a godsend to Mr. Granville, I assure&#xD;
you. It could not have happene~t better, for Mr. Nordheim&#xD;
was a.bold, bad man. .He certainly cared neither for God' nor&#xD;
.,the devil, If he had not died when he did, I am quite sure&#xD;
Mr. Granville would have been obliged ,to have dissolvedis&#xD;
Commercial connexion with .him, and these dissolutions alre&#xD;
always troublesome affairs. Nordheim gotkilled, and all' diffi-&#xD;
culty was at an end. I am really quite pleased to meet with&#xD;

you, and I hope you will frequently visit us. We shall always&#xD;
be happy to see you."&#xD;
The Colonel's invitation was warmly seconded by his amia-&#xD;
ble partner, and when the breakfast was over, and it was time&#xD;
for Mr. Gaillard to leave, he was.obliged to give his address,&#xD;
and promise that he would call very soon again. -It will be&#xD;
easily supposed that Frank Gaillard gave a willing promise to&#xD;
comply with such a pressing invitation. Mr. Gaillard gave his&#xD;
address as at the City Hotel. Such was not the fact however.&#xD;
A year previous, this gay youth had taken a house in Wooster&#xD;
street, not far from Canal. . The rent was five hundred dollars.&#xD;
He had furnished it handsomely, and employed a very intelli-&#xD;
gent colored woman to keep house for him. He had arranged&#xD;
that his letters should be sent to the City Hotel, and every day&#xD;
he called there for them.&#xD;
Probably one of the most accomplished seducers, and one of&#xD;
the most successful ones that ever visited New York, was this&#xD;
same Frank Gaillard. He was an only son. His father died&#xD;
when he was quite young, and left him a large property; but&#xD;
in addition to this, he inherited from an aunt a large plantation&#xD;
in St. John Berkley Parish, on Cooper river, a large rice plan-&#xD;
tation, and about three hundred slaves. This, when he became&#xD;
-f age, he left under the charge of an overseer named Frede-&#xD;
rick§, who was both honest and capable of planting successfully.&#xD;
The young Gaillard, when in the South, resided mostly with&#xD;
his mother, who lived on a plantation some twenty miles dis-&#xD;
tant from his own. He also owned a n.agnificent residence in&#xD;
Charleston, where his mother and sister resided a portion of,&#xD;
the year,- when the country fever prevailed on the plantations.&#xD;
The family also owned an upland cotton plantation near Green'%&#xD;
vIle, and'frequently the mother and sister passed the summer&#xD;
season in the up country. Not so Frank. He had been edu-&#xD;
cated at tie North, and graduated at Yale College, New Ha-&#xD;
ven, with a fair standing. While pursuing his studies at Yale,&#xD;
he had frequent opportunities of visiting New York, and it&#xD;
was there, that he acquired habits of dissipation, and a love for&#xD;
illicit and animal pleasures. He could gamble, but he was too&#xD;
cool-blooded to ever be injured by it. He could not have be-&#xD;
-ome a professional gambler. He was a splendid specimen of&#xD;
a man. Added to this, was a power of conversation beyond&#xD;
that of. almost any man we ever met. He was perfectly irre-&#xD;
sistible when he chose to be so,. and could fascinate any one,&#xD;
man or woman, who came within his circle. This latter power,&#xD;
when combined with a total want of principle, a perfect reck.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
VIGOR. .                   187&#xD;
iessness of consequences, and a courage that was unquestioned,&#xD;
made him, where females were concerned, a most dangerous&#xD;
acquaintance. He spared no pains, no money, no labor, no&#xD;
patience, when he undertook to ruin and seduce a young and&#xD;
lovely girl. Her rank or her position in society was no bar or&#xD;
safety guard against his designs. The poor working girl with-&#xD;
out a dollar or a friend, or the daughter of the wealthiest mers&#xD;
chant or most powerful statesman, were equally. insecure against&#xD;
his lustful passions. le regarded them as fair game, and&#xD;
while he would have scorned to have his honor questioned, or&#xD;
his veracity doubted, and would have fought knee deep in blood&#xD;
with any one who questioned either, yet when the ruin of a&#xD;
female was to be effected, truth, honor, all was forgotten. The&#xD;
basest falsehoods, the most solemn promises, the most sacred&#xD;
influences were brought to bear. He kept house for no other&#xD;
purpose than to get virtuous and respectable girls or married&#xD;
women to visit there. He went so far as to invite them to call&#xD;
and visit his mother, who, it is needless' to add, never saw the&#xD;
inside of his rsidence. When once the poor victim-was en-&#xD;
snared inside those -parlors, her ruin was effected; for then,.&#xD;
when she was startled at not meeting his mother, lie would tell&#xD;
the poor girl that it was all a farce-that his mother was not&#xD;
there, but that it was a house of the worst kind, and then&#xD;
threaten herwith exposure if she did not submit to his base&#xD;
purposes. After all this coaxing and threats, he laid aside all&#xD;
further mild measures, and resorted to force, and generally&#xD;
succeeded. He used wines--and if these failed he resorted to&#xD;
drugged wines. He boasted that no girl or married woman&#xD;
ever left his house in Wooster street except she left him a full&#xD;
conqueror.&#xD;
fhe very intelligent reader may say that such a character&#xD;
3     could not exist in New York a day oi a month, and pursue un-&#xD;
punished so high-handed a game. His power seemed almost&#xD;
miraculous in this regard ; his oily tongue, when once his ob-&#xD;
ject had been accomplished, would seem capable of extenuating&#xD;
and procuring forgiveness from injured victims for the most&#xD;
atrocious rape ; and this horrid crime, which not once, but in&#xD;
dozens of cases, seenied to fix-permanently the attachment of&#xD;
the wronged one. Then he was liberal with his money, and&#xD;
had an abundance of it to be liberail-with. Never in any one&#xD;
instance was the notice of the authorities called to his villain-&#xD;
ous acts. .Even had it been otherwise, his .money and his&#xD;
power of persuasion wouldbhave been: placed in requisition'&#xD;

were, he was never ashamed ; but in company with male friends&#xD;
he would openly boast of his having seduced that young lady,&#xD;
or of having debauched such a married woman; would give&#xD;
names and dates, and all the attending circumstances.&#xD;
On one occasion, at a dinner, he made use of a lady's name&#xD;
in such a connection. A gentleman arose, and said, "If Mr.&#xD;
Gaillard has told the truth, he is a scoundrel. If he has not,&#xD;
he is not only -a scoundrel, but a vile liar to boot." Gaillard&#xD;
knocked him down. A challenge was the consequence, and the&#xD;
opponent of the renowned seducer was made a cripple for the&#xD;
rest of his life, for his free speech.&#xD;
Mr. Gaillard made the acquaintance of Mac Neil. It was&#xD;
he who, was relieved of some financial difficulty by the Colonel,&#xD;
and he repaid him when Mac needed it. He continued to meet&#xD;
the Colonel frequently, invited- him to dine, gave him a seat&#xD;
in a box at the theatre often, and would have loaned the Col-&#xD;
onel money. It was a custom of Gaillard's, when he met Col-&#xD;
onel Mac Neil at any of the gambling 'saloons, to furnish him&#xD;
with funds to try his luck on their joint account.&#xD;
This same Frafcis Gaillard was the Southern gentleman who&#xD;
had been introduced on the morning to Miss Isabella Benson,&#xD;
and was so cordially received by her parents. Young Benson&#xD;
knew nothing of his character or his antecedents. Frank&#xD;
Gaillard's positionin society was unquestioned. He was in-&#xD;
vited to the most select parties, and associated with the high-&#xD;
est. You may know what sort of a character he bore. On a&#xD;
particular opcasion he was introduced to a family where there,&#xD;
was a lovely daughter. She had a lover who knew Gaillard.&#xD;
With much frankness he informed Gaillard that he had told the&#xD;
girl in question and her parents exactly his character.&#xD;
"I told them, Gaillard, that you had ruined many girls, and&#xD;
was the greatest libertine alive."&#xD;
"Had I a design to ruin your fair flower, my dear sir, I&#xD;
snould feel much obliged for your paving the way by giving,&#xD;
me such a character."&#xD;
" How so? What do you mean, Mr. Gaillard ?'"&#xD;
"Simply this. Your Intended is a simple-hearted, innocent&#xD;
girl. She believes you to be a moral and a safe man. She&#xD;
never thinks of you in any other light, or in connection with&#xD;
any unusual feeling connected, with her own passions. You&#xD;
give me an immoral character. I meet her, -for the moment;&#xD;
she sees me ; her head is occupied with funny ideas. She is&#xD;
agitated. She is canvassing over the subject, wondering who&#xD;
the victims are-whether she knows them-what would be her&#xD;
&#xD;
fate if she too were a victim. The ice is broren-.-if she has&#xD;
one naughty thought, it will grow into fruit.. Time and oppor-&#xD;
tunity only is needed. She don't need me to break down the&#xD;
barriers by a free and unrestrained conversation upon forbid-&#xD;
den subjects. She expects it as a matter of course, if she puts&#xD;
;'     herself within my reach. I have no design upon your fair&#xD;
fiancs, but I tell you, if I had, you have paved the way for&#xD;
me. It is a bad policy for a young fellow to ever try to injure&#xD;
a rival, by telling the girl that a rival suitor is imnmoral and a&#xD;
libertine. Much better tell her that the, rival is secretly a&#xD;
saint, and says his prayers three times a day, and reads a chap-&#xD;
ter in the New Testament when he goes to bed, ,nd one of&#xD;
David's Psalms when he gets up at daylight."&#xD;
Frank Gaillard in this very case forgot his resolution, for in&#xD;
less than three weeks he did seduce the intended bride of his&#xD;
friend, and she eventually became a poor miserable girl of the&#xD;
town.&#xD;
We leave the career of this gay Southerner for a time, to&#xD;
begin a more interesting chapter.&#xD;

MR. GRANV:LLE Was so well pleased with the conduct of his&#xD;
chief clerk, Marion Monck, that he determined to show his ap-&#xD;
preciation of his character by giving a magnificent dinner in his&#xD;
honor, on his twenty-first birth-day. He announced his inten-&#xD;
tftn to our hero '&#xD;
"Well, I really feel grateful, Mr. Granville, the more so&#xD;
as it is entirely unexpected on my part, and -I cannot realize&#xD;
that I have deserved.so much honor at your hands," remarked&#xD;
Marion in reply.&#xD;
Mr. Granville gave a short happy, laugh, and said, "Ah,&#xD;
Marion, all my dinners in your favor cannot recompense you&#xD;
as you deserve, but I wish to know how many friends you will&#xD;
invite ? I have but very few to' come, but I want yvu to wpake&#xD;
out a good long list. I am satisfied that you will invite no m'ag&#xD;

to place his-feet under my mahogany unless he is entitled to&#xD;
be there as your friend; and I am quite sure you have no&#xD;
friends-who have not recommended themselves to your friend-&#xD;
ship or acquaintance by being in some way English clover at&#xD;
least."&#xD;
"I believe my circle of acquaintancesrMr. Granville, although&#xD;
somewhat limited, are rather clever, and at least original. I&#xD;
have no particular friends except at the conting house, and&#xD;
from that list I shall invite but one-Mr. Wilson," Marion re-&#xD;
plied.&#xD;
" Excellent -Wilson is an original in his way, and one of my&#xD;
oldest friends in London. I am glad you have invited hun&#xD;
without a suggestion from me."&#xD;
While Mr. Granville was speaking, Marion took a pencil&#xD;
from' his pocket, and wrote on a piece of paper a few names.&#xD;
Handing it to Mr. Granville, he remarked, "Here. is a full&#xD;
list--only a baker's dozen--including Mr. Wilson, of whom&#xD;
we have spoken.".&#xD;
" Very good. I will have invitations written in my own name,&#xD;
and state that the dinner is given in honor of your birth-day,"&#xD;
said Mr. Granville-&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Granville; 'and when they are ready, will&#xD;
you be so good as to hand them to me. Some of them it wil&#xD;
be difficult to find without my aid ;'" and Marion laughed as the&#xD;
idea crossed his mind of what a hunt the porter of Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville would have to find some of the names on the list. -&#xD;
"I will do so, Marion, with pleasure. I have but four&#xD;
friends that I shall invite on my own account. One is Cap-&#xD;
tain Marryatt, who is stopping down Broadway at Blancard's,&#xD;
another is an old London acquaintance who resides with his&#xD;
family at Staten Island, and has lately gone into business in&#xD;
this city, Mr. Cubson, and Colonel Benson and his .daughter-.&#xD;
The Colonel is, as you are aware, connected officially with the&#xD;
British Government. Besides these four and ,your list, my&#xD;
daughter and my sister-in-law will 'be the only ladies at, tle&#xD;
table, and they will run away early. I shall order a dinner&#xD;
for twenty' persons, and if I am not mistaken it will be rather&#xD;
a choice affair,:' observeil Mr. Granville-.&#xD;
"I hope it will, and be pleasant for you aid agreeable to all&#xD;
those invited," said Marion.; and with these words they parted,&#xD;
Marion to attend to his duties, and- Mr. Granville to carry out&#xD;
his ideas in reference to the dinner party.'&#xD;
At six o'clock on the evening of December 2, 1883, the din-&#xD;
ner given by Mr. Granville came off at his residence in State&#xD;

street. It was a dinner such as few could get up; for Mr.)Gran-&#xD;
Ville was an epicure himself, had traveled extensively, and his&#xD;
wines were of the very choicest quality.&#xD;
The guests began to arrive before six, and were shown into&#xD;
the south front parlor, which overlooked the, Battery. The&#xD;
walls were covered with really choice paintings,- selected with&#xD;
great care by Mr. Granville, who had seen some of the best&#xD;
paintings in the galleries of Europe, and was not likely to be&#xD;
deceived in purchasing on his own account. Isabella was&#xD;
seated at the piano, playing ",The Last Rose of Sammer" very&#xD;
much to the enjoyment of Mr. Cubson, whose jolty red ace and&#xD;
happy laugh made a picture of itself. Miss Benson was near&#xD;
the piano, listening' to soft nonsense from young Gaillard of&#xD;
South Carolina. In a recess of the window oveirlooking the&#xD;
Battery was the brilliant Mrs. Tom Granville, and seated near&#xD;
her, apparently engaged in earnest but low-toned conversation&#xD;
was a short thick set man, with very'dark hair, and very coarse&#xD;
looking. It was the celebrated Captain Marryatt. Colonel&#xD;
Benson stood near them, watching some, object upon' the Bat-&#xD;
tery. H-e was tall, slim, pale-faced, very intellectual, and a&#xD;
perfect gentleman' in appearance, but English from top to toe.&#xD;
These were the friends that Mr. Granville had invited, as he&#xD;
remarked, "on his own hook." Scattered around the room&#xD;
were others, invited by Mr. Granville at. the request of Marion,&#xD;
As they arrived, Marion introduced them to Mr. Granville,&#xD;
who in turn presented them to Isabella his daughter.&#xD;
Distinct couples were, formed all over the room. Some ad-&#xD;
mired the paintings, others listened.to the music, while others,&#xD;
who were previously acquainted, conversed together upon the-&#xD;
variousmatters of the day.&#xD;
The party assembled numbered twenty-one. Marion passed&#xD;
from one to the other,. endeavoring to .make each one of his&#xD;
own friends at home, and perfectly at his ease.- He came near&#xD;
Mrs. Kate Granville, and she exclaimed,&#xD;
" Marion, where upon this earth did you manage to pick up&#xD;
such a lot of funny acquaintances?  Who, in the name of all&#xD;
that is good-looking, are they 1"&#xD;
- " Friends of mine.-eclever people in their way, and all 'are&#xD;
men worth knowing," replied- 'Marion.&#xD;
"Do introduce me to that modest, bashful person, dressed&#xD;
in black, who seems afraid of his own shadow," said Mrs.&#xD;
SGranville.&#xD;
" Noti now, Aunt Kate, but I will do so before dinner is.~&#xD;

over ;" and he bent over and whispered something in her, ear,&#xD;
She actually jumped off her chair with astonishment.&#xD;
"Marion, are you in earnest?  Is that so ? Mr. Bennett of&#xD;
the Herald ?" she asked earnestly.&#xD;
"Precisely so,." was the reply.&#xD;
"And is he going to dine here ?" asked Mrs. Tom Granville.&#xD;
"Unquestionably he will," was the reply .&#xD;
Kate Granville looked long and earnestly at him, and then&#xD;
remarked, "Marion, I am' sure you are quizzing me. That&#xD;
gentlemanly, quiet person the notorious Bennett! I don't be-&#xD;
lieve a word of it."&#xD;
Reader, in 1834, when the Herald first started, the other&#xD;
papers made such unfair onslaughts on the new comer, as were&#xD;
perfectly .terrige. It seemed as though the old sixpenny sheets&#xD;
had a presentiment, that unless they crushed out the Herald&#xD;
and Bennett, that it would be his destiny to crush them out.'&#xD;
Some of the most worthy people in the city had made up their&#xD;
minds, from these attacks, that Mr. Bennett was a perfect ruf-&#xD;
fian.--a blackguard in looks and actions----a iian who attended&#xD;
balls, and sneaked into houses.of ill-fame to get names of indi-&#xD;
viduals to attack in his paper. They could not conceive of a&#xD;
more base character than he was supposed to be ; and the idea-&#xD;
of inviting Mr. Bennett to a dinner among gentlemen and ladies,&#xD;
was considered a species of atrocity. But to resume our writ-&#xD;
ing. It was now half past six, dinner was announced, and the&#xD;
entire party passed into the dining room. Mr. Granville took&#xD;
the seat at the head of. the table, and requested Marion to do'&#xD;
the honors at the other end.. The ladies had seats near Mr.&#xD;
Granville, and Marion had some choice spirits of the other sex.&#xD;
to flank him.&#xD;
We have no taste for describing a dinner... Suffice it to say,&#xD;
that the good things were numerous, and served up in excel-&#xD;
lent style. The wines were' delicious, and several health&#xD;
were drank before the ladies took their departure. Then Mr.&#xD;
Granville opened.&#xD;
"Now, gentlenien, I want every .one to be at home and be&#xD;
happy. Get acquainted with each other the best way you can,&#xD;
And now let me propose a toast. It is the birth-day of that&#xD;
young gent at the other end of the table. He is twenty-one to-&#xD;
day. Here is his health-a9nd may he and- his. friends, be as&#xD;
well satisfied with him on his three-score and tenth birth-day&#xD;
as we are on his twenty-first."&#xD;
All joined, and drank bumpers. Marion made .a reply, ra-&#xD;

ther confused, for he was somewhat bashful before so many,&#xD;
but he was let off easy.&#xD;
"0Mr. Bennett; shall I have the pleasure of a glass' of wine&#xD;
with you ?" asked Mr. Granville. Every eye was instantly&#xD;
directed to Mr. Bennett, for with the exception of Marion, he&#xD;
did not know a soul in the room, and not one even knew him&#xD;
by sight before this dinner.&#xD;
"With pleasure," said Mr. Bennett, and he drank his wine&#xD;
and bowed to Mr. Granville.&#xD;
"We all know the Herald," continued' Mr. Granville, "al-&#xD;
though to most of us this is the first time we have .had the&#xD;
pleasure of your personal acquaintance."&#xD;
Mr. Bennett made a quiet reply, and conversation became&#xD;
general again until Mr. Cubson was called upon for a song, and&#xD;
ho gave in the most exquisite manner,- "My pretty Jane" to&#xD;
the great delight of all the company.&#xD;
Some one else was asked, but refused, and then Mr. Gran-&#xD;
vlle .sang a pretty air. On its conclusion he observed, "Now&#xD;
I have sung a song, and therefore it is perfectly proper that I&#xD;
should offer a resolution that every one at this table shall, in&#xD;
regular order, contribute some thin toward our spending a&#xD;
merry evening; hifle cannot sing a song, he must give us a&#xD;
good sentiment or toast, or tell a good story. No one shall be&#xD;
et off."  is proposal was acceded to at once by all, and as&#xD;
Captain Maryatt sat next to Mr. Granville, it was his turn&#xD;
next. He complied, and sang a song called "Artichokes and&#xD;
'Cauliflowers," and his song and health being drunk, the next&#xD;
in order was Marion Monck.&#xD;
Marion had never sang a song in his life. Speech-makin&#xD;
was not his forte, and he had never written.a line, and did not&#xD;
know that he had it in him, but he told a story. "I have been&#xD;
very lucky, said Marion, "since I came to New, York to fid&#xD;
a home, never having been but for a few days in a boarding-&#xD;
house, and have lived in the family of one of my, employers-&#xD;
formerly with one now dead, and more recently with the kind&#xD;
friend, as well as employer, who now presides at the head of&#xD;
this table," and he bowed to Mr. Granville, and then con-&#xD;
tinued, "'but I had a friend who arrived in New York about&#xD;
the same time I did. He is dead now, poor fellow. Board-&#xD;
ing-houses were too much for him. When he, was, on his&#xD;
death-bed he said to me, 'Marion, beware. of boardinghouses,&#xD;
pious boarding-houses especially,' and he told me. the fearful&#xD;
tale which I shall repeat as nearly as I can remember it in his'-&#xD;
words,' My mother was a pious woman. I was an only, child.&#xD;

When I left home, at the tender age of fourteen, to come and&#xD;
try my fortune in this great metropolis of sin and commerce,&#xD;
she was fearful. I was born and brought up- in a beautiful&#xD;
New England town, that contained about four hundred inhab-&#xD;
itants and four churches or places'of worship-one Ep.iscopal,&#xD;
one Baptist, one Methodist, one New, and one Old School Pres-&#xD;
byterian, . and one, Roman Catholic. It was a pious place.&#xD;
Every church had a bell, and on Sunday morning was a jing-&#xD;
ling that would astonish a small crowd. My mother was an&#xD;
Episcopalian, and I was brought up in that faith, but -she was&#xD;
a good woman, and was herself inclined to think that there&#xD;
might be pious people even among other denominations beside&#xD;
her own, but she was not certain upon that point. Religion, as&#xD;
you see, coming from a small village with six churches, was a&#xD;
starting point with me in life. My mother was all anxiety to&#xD;
get me in a pious boarding-house. Well, I reached New York&#xD;
safely, and got with a pious landlady, a Mrs. Bacon.  She was&#xD;
a sister of the Tappans. She commenced on me in a regular&#xD;
course. I had to be at prayers in the morning, and prayers at&#xD;
night, and we had to stand grace over a miserable piece of half&#xD;
done beef at dinner, and bean soup. Grace at tea, over dish-&#xD;
water, a slice of stale bread, rancid butter, and ginger-nuts of&#xD;
the commonest kind. The old lady bought her provisions by&#xD;
the cent's worth at a Dutch grocer's. I remonstrated with&#xD;
great benevolence-told her that by buying wholesale she&#xD;
could'get good articles and at a low figure. She was grateful,&#xD;
said she didn't know any wholesale grocers, begged me to buy&#xD;
her by the quantity and she would pay me. Did' so-bought&#xD;
eighty dollars' worth. Never got 'paid to this day. Insisted&#xD;
that I was hard-hearted; wanted me to go and hear Burchard&#xD;
at the Chatham street Theatre; went with old lady ; cousin&#xD;
went with old lady's pretty daughter ; Burchard went it strong;&#xD;
old lady got excited; rose in her seat; audience paused;&#xD;
begged Burchard to praydor a handsome young sinner by her&#xD;
side ; called me by name, Harvey Foot ; got up angry ; begged&#xD;
Burchard on my own hook. to pray for a swindling old lady,&#xD;
who had stuck me eighty-five dollars ip groceries, and wouldn't&#xD;
pay up'; audience excited; expelled by .saint members, amd&#xD;
obliged to quit pious boarding-houses.  That was boarding.&#xD;
house No. 1.' " When Marion' had reached thus far, the quaint&#xD;
manner in which he narrated the story-not a smile upon-his&#xD;
countenance, not a muscle moved, the effect was richly lu-&#xD;
dierous, and the emnall audience actually screamed as he con-&#xD;
tinued on with Pious Boarding-House/No. 2, No. 3, No. 4 and&#xD;

so. No one was more pleased than Mr. Bennett. He turned&#xD;
to a neighbor and remarked, "A man who can talk that way&#xD;
can write. He will make a clever editor one of these days,&#xD;
that Marion Monck." When Marion had finished, he proposed&#xD;
a toast. "Health and long life to all pious boardig-house&#xD;
keepers, and may they never lack stale bread or ginger cake&#xD;
nuts for their teas." The toast was drank with shouts of&#xD;
laughter. "As it is my turn, gentlemen, I call upon my&#xD;
neighbor here-neighbor in a double sense, as he was born in&#xD;
the same parish in the.South as myself-Mr. Francis Gaillard."&#xD;
Mr. Gaillard arose, and was excusing himself from a song,&#xD;
when he was interrupted by Colonel Benson. - "Pardon, gen-&#xD;
tlemen ; I beg to ask Mr. Gaillard to tell us .some story about&#xD;
the South-something about the slaves; these are exciting&#xD;
times. Horrid stories are told about the cruelty of Southern&#xD;
masters. Mr. Gaillard is a large slave-holder, I hope he will&#xD;
give us an anecdote of a different kind.&#xD;
"Thank you, sir, for the suggestion. I am not certain that&#xD;
a little story I can tell will contain any thing interesting, or&#xD;
possess any especial merit. It shall have one advantage over&#xD;
those horrid tales of tortured and murdered slaves; it shall be&#xD;
true. My father,- when a young man, had a favorite slave&#xD;
named Billy. He was coachman, and frequently travelled with&#xD;
my father, with or without the carriage. On one occasion they&#xD;
were in a boat crossing Gooper river, and it upset. My father&#xD;
had no more idea of swimming than he had of flying, and death&#xD;
by drowning seemed inevitable, but Billy was not only a splen-*&#xD;
did swimmer, but a most powerful man. Re seized hold of&#xD;
my father, and although the tide was ebbing, yet, after almost&#xD;
superhuman exertions, he succeeded in getting his master and&#xD;
himself safe on shore. It was some time before my father&#xD;
came to, and he and Billy footed it to the plantation.  My&#xD;
respected parent and Billy were nearly of the same age. The&#xD;
fact became known that Billy had saved my governor's life,&#xD;
and although it secured him a great many praises and favors&#xD;
from other members of our family, yet it never seemed to alter&#xD;
my father's course. He seemed to have forgot it, and though&#xD;
Billy did pretty much as he had a mind to do, I do not remem-&#xD;
ber that Billy got severely whipped by my father's orders ex-&#xD;
cept on one occasion."&#xD;
"Whip a-poor negro who had saved his master's life! That&#xD;
is gratitude with a vengeance," niuttered the jolly EVnuglishinan&#xD;
Mr. Oubson.&#xD;
," Let me finish, sir, if you please," continued Mr. Gaillard.&#xD;
&#xD;

S1GOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"The occasion was this. My father was somewhat eccentric,&#xD;
but I ever found him a very 'just man. He had an overseer&#xD;
on one of' his rice plan tations, a Mr. Maice, who was a great&#xD;
band for whipping. fy father did not exactly like it, but&#xD;
when he spoke to Maice, the overseer would say, very deci-&#xD;
dedly, 'it's no use to try to get along, sir, with niggers unless&#xD;
you give them a lashing. I never, order more ,than twenty&#xD;
lashes, and it does the niggers good.' Maice took his leave,&#xD;
my father pondered over the matter, for some time, and then&#xD;
called Billy.&#xD;
"Billy came.&#xD;
"'How d'y, Billy.'&#xD;
How 'd'y, Massa Frank.'&#xD;
Billy, go and get -the overseer's whip.'  Billy went and&#xD;
got it. 'Now help me take off all my clothes,' said my father,&#xD;
Gor a mity, Massa Frank, what you gwine to do now?'&#xD;
said Billy,&#xD;
I want you to give me twenty lashes, as hard as you can&#xD;
put it on, as haid as Maice whips the niggers,". said my father.&#xD;
Why, Massa Frank, wat de debbil you want for do now?&#xD;
Get dis nigger hung?' replied Billy, who was very much&#xD;
scared.&#xD;
I want you to do as I say.. If you don't, I'll send for Sam,&#xD;
and have you whipped,' said my father.&#xD;
No; I swear God I can't lick you, Massa,' replied Billy.&#xD;
"My father got in a-rage, and called in Sam, who was a sort&#xD;
of second negro chief in the house. Sam  came.  'Sam, I&#xD;
want you to whip Billy,' said my father.&#xD;
Eh, Billy?  What you do Massa now? Take off your&#xD;
coat.'&#xD;
Billy did so at once, and Sam gave him two or three good&#xD;
cuts, when Billy says, ' If dat is all you want, I gib dem cuts&#xD;
myself.'&#xD;
Will you lick me now, Billy?' said my father.&#xD;
0,. yes, Massa. I'll lick you. Gib me de whip'-and&#xD;
Billy took it and gave his master two rather -hard cuts.&#xD;
Lick me harder, you rascal, orI'll have Sam  lick you&#xD;
again,'-said my father. Thus admonished, Billy put in 'de&#xD;
big licks,'- as Sam,' who was a spectator remarked,- until the&#xD;
quantity was reached, his master counting at every stroke,&#xD;
one, two, up to twenty. 'There, Billy. I don't like it, and&#xD;
I'll be. damned "to hell if I'll ever have another nigger whipped&#xD;
on mny plantation.' And he never did. He never -afterwards&#xD;
had an overseer ; and if a negro deserved punishment, he gave&#xD;

&#xD;
the very worst that can ever be given in the South--it was to&#xD;
transfer him from one plantation to another.&#xD;
"But to return to Billy. My father died. When his will&#xD;
was opened, it was found to contain a clause stating that many&#xD;
years ago Billy Gaillard saved his life, and that he bequeathed&#xD;
to him, first, his freedom, second, Lhe sum of five hundred dol-&#xD;
lars per annum, to paid quarterly at the Bank of Charleston, a&#xD;
house on the plantation, a horse every year, and, as he wished&#xD;
Billy to continue to work on the plantation, he was to receive&#xD;
pay for whatever he did from my father's successor, myself.&#xD;
There is not a more independent gentleman in the South, sir,&#xD;
than'Billy Gaillard. When I am 'at home, he is always near&#xD;
me-lectures and.scolds me as if I were a child-has mar-&#xD;
ried off his family, has lots of children, and is'-more re-&#xD;
spected than ever was a patriarch in Bible times.    He&#xD;
has but- one weakness - when he goes to Charleston to get&#xD;
his quarterly dues, he generally manages to get moderately&#xD;

than his income. le niakes all his sons and daughters com-&#xD;

know to even dream of buying any of them 'their freedom,&#xD;
although he has the means to do it; for he has saved and in-&#xD;
vested money for a great many years, and owns half-a-dozen&#xD;
valuable houses in Charleston that he rents out and receives&#xD;
quite an income from. Gentlemen, I hope I have contributed&#xD;
a little to passing away a pleasant time. I will conclude with&#xD;
a toast. I give-&#xD;
"'The health of every Northern Abolitionist who will 'go&#xD;
South and see the Institution of Slavery as it really exists'"&#xD;
The story was warmly received, and the comical idea of the&#xD;
toast made all laugh. Even old Cubson growled out that he&#xD;
was afraid the healths of any northern gentlemen who made&#xD;
such an excursion would not be greatly benefitted. Mr.&#xD;
Gaillard called upon Mr. Bennett for his quota. Mr. Bennett&#xD;
very quietly remarked,&#xD;
"Gentlemen, I am not much of a hand to tell a story, but I&#xD;
would rather be guilty of telling a stupid One than to lack the\&#xD;
courtesy of trying to contribute my share to the general mirth&#xD;
and amusement. The story told about pious boarding-house&#xD;
keepers, but the more especially the description of the New&#xD;
England village of four hundred inhabitants and six distinct&#xD;
houses of worship, reminds me of an adventAre in one of the&#xD;
same sort of towns, and I will try and narrate it. Some time&#xD;
after I had arrived in this country I found myself in Boston,&#xD;

&#xD;
and with but little to do. I determined to travel into the in-&#xD;
terior and see if I could not pick up something. I had a good&#xD;
education, and I had heard that school teachers were in re-&#xD;
quest. I will make my story as concise as possible, and with-&#xD;
out going into details, will mention simply that I found myself&#xD;
in some such place in Connecticut as Mr. Monck has des-&#xD;
eribed. The town was divided into three school districts, as&#xD;
they call them. The middle district required a "school mas-&#xD;
ter," that is the designation'in Yankee land, and not school&#xD;
teacher.  I offered my services to become the school master.&#xD;
It was necessary to see the Committee, and I applied to them&#xD;
for the situation.. They consisted- of a Presbyterian clergy-&#xD;
man, a Squire Phelps, and Deacon Botsford. After some co-&#xD;
siderable bother, an hour was appointed when the School Com-&#xD;
mittee met. I was there punctually at the time. The school-.&#xD;
house was a little one-story building, painted red outside, and&#xD;
the inside was covered with all sorts of drawings' and orna-&#xD;
ments made by ambitious scholars. Presently the important&#xD;
Committee, arrived one by one; At last the solemn business&#xD;
was opened. Squire Phelps asked if I was the 'young man'&#xD;
who was anxious to take charge of that district school. I re-&#xD;
plied in the most amiable and seductive manner that I was the&#xD;
person. 'Deacon, we must examine whether he is capable of&#xD;
taking charge 6f our school.'  The. deacon grunted an affirma-&#xD;
tive-and then commenced such an examination as was never&#xD;
heard of before. I was asked how cheap I would act-whether&#xD;
I would board round among the parents of the scholars-and&#xD;
whether I could measure wood. I got along very well and&#xD;
quite satisfactorily until the clergyman asked me, 'What is&#xD;
your religion, Mr. Bennett?' I replied that I was a Catholic.&#xD;
Then the three committee men took a general stare at me, and&#xD;
afterwards at each other. 'Where are you from?' was the&#xD;
next question. I did not think, but replied simply, 'From&#xD;
Scotland.' '0 yes-I know where that is. It is up near Mid-&#xD;
dletown, in, Windham County.' There is, I have since learned,&#xD;
a town called-New Scotland somewhere in that region. I was&#xD;
requested to retire. I did so, but was soon called back. 'Mr.&#xD;
Bennett, we have consulted together in reference to your ap-&#xD;
plication, and after examination,. very impartially conducted,&#xD;
we are obliged to decline your offer, as we do not consider'you&#xD;
competent to teach this district school.'&#xD;
"Gentlemen," continued Mr. Bennett, "you may form some&#xD;
idea of my mortification. I assure you, I never applied since&#xD;
ra school teacher's berth. Yiet I believe I am possessed of&#xD;

some ability, but it has taken a new direction. I have, as most&#xD;
of you are aware, started a new enterprise, and in the Herald&#xD;
I have had great success. I can assure you, that-by the regis-&#xD;
ter I now circulate up in Connecticut over twenty-five hundred&#xD;
copies of my paper daily, and I believe I may say that that day&#xD;
will come, improbable as it may seem, when I will issue ten&#xD;
thousand copies of the daily Herald. I will give you a senti-&#xD;
ment, 'A new era in Journalism.'&#xD;
It was drank with enthusiasm; and the idea of a man of Mr.&#xD;
Bennett's. acknowledged cleverness to have been rejected as a&#xD;
Yankee schoolmaster, was perfectly rich and refreshing. Mr.&#xD;
Bennett hoped that Colonel Mae Neil would take his turn at&#xD;
the oar. The Colonel said he should not trespass long upon&#xD;
.their time-that he was happy to meet with Mr. Bennett.-that&#xD;
the Herald was giving new life to the community, and was&#xD;
making itself felt, and he hoped it would reach a circulation&#xD;
of ten thousand daily, but that he supposed was an utter&#xD;
impossibility, an extravagant idea, that Mr. Bennett could&#xD;
hardly expect would be realized in many years, if ever. "I&#xD;
cannot sing you but one song, gentlemen-I will try that.;"&#xD;
and Mac Neil sang-with good taste and feeling, "My Heart's&#xD;
in the Highlaids.&#xD;
The company had by this time become quite excited. Songs,&#xD;
stories and toasts followed each other in quick succession, un-&#xD;
til nearly midnight, when it was proposed that all shoid join&#xD;
in the good old song of " Good night, and God be with us all."&#xD;
All were in good spirits, but no one was quite intoxicated, at.&#xD;
least to such an extent as not to be able to find his way home.&#xD;
When the party broke up, Marion retired to his room. A new&#xD;
life was before him-he was twenty-one years old.&#xD;

for a period of years in clerkship, until the seasons of youth&#xD;
and middle age are passed, and old age reached without a hope&#xD;
or desire of bettering their. condition, or of taking the chance&#xD;
of bettering it, by going into business upon their own account,&#xD;
becoming principals and employers themselves. .It is a strong&#xD;
characteristic of the general American mind. He does not con-&#xD;
sider himself settled in life until he is in business on his own&#xD;
hook. He never dreams of getting married until he is his own&#xD;
employer. A young clerk's highest ambition is to get into&#xD;
business upon his own account, so 'soon as he is twenty-one&#xD;
years old. From this cause spring a thousand fearful evils in&#xD;
a commercial.community. Half the failures that occur to per-.&#xD;
sons engaged in mercantile pursuits can be traced to this&#xD;
going into business at an early age, before experience justifies&#xD;
it. Could all the young men who have gone into business&#xD;
upon their own account in New York city before they reached&#xD;
twenty-five years, te traced out, it would be found that they&#xD;
have failed where, had they been content to gain experience as&#xD;
clerks until they were thirty years of age, their after success&#xD;
would probably'have been certain. The Jews are a sensible&#xD;
people in this regard. Their children don't take upon them-&#xD;
selves the responsibilities of men until they reach thirty. Our&#xD;
blessed Lord and Saviour did not separate himself from paren-&#xD;
tal control until he was thirty.&#xD;
Marion Monck was not destined to, be an exception to the&#xD;
general rule. Head reached tenty-one, and he began to&#xD;
think that it was high time to get into business. The next&#xD;
morning after the dinner, Mr. Granville informed himthat his&#xD;
salary in future would be one thousand dollars per annum-&#xD;
"As you will continue to reside at my house without any ex-&#xD;
pense to yourself, you ought to be able' to lay aside some~&#xD;
money every year, Marion. Are your parents in a situation to&#xD;
give you any capital to start in business, when your experi-&#xD;
ence justifies such'a step ?"&#xD;
" Indeed they are nt. They might raise a small sum, but&#xD;
riouldnever consent to it. I must depend upon my own ex-&#xD;
ertions,"replied Marion.&#xD;
"And a better reliance no man 'can want in this country,&#xD;
my boy. If you go on gaining commercialinformation, it will&#xD;
be of use to you some day. Water will find its own level, and&#xD;
so will business experience, capability, honesty, and activit.&#xD;
You possess all of' the qualifications, and all you have to do is&#xD;
to pursue. a straightforward .course, and you will gain a foot-&#xD;

fled in saying what my intentions are towards you eventually,&#xD;
but if you should remain with me a few years longer, and&#xD;
. should then wish to go into business, I shall take great pleas.&#xD;
ure in forwarding your views. Very likely I shall hear of&#xD;
some person who has capital who would be willing to form a&#xD;
partnership with you, because you have such good business&#xD;
qualifications."&#xD;
Marion had not lost a word of all this speech, which was an&#xD;
unusually long one for Mr. Granville to make. He was pleased-&#xD;
with it, and, yet displeased. It was cold, and strictly mercan-&#xD;
tile. It gave him  no hope of the future, so far as becoming&#xD;
interested in the business of Mr. Granville was concerned. It&#xD;
seemed to remove Isabella to an iimneasurable distance from&#xD;
his reach, but still le thanked his employer for his good inten-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
"I shall soon make a change in the style of the firm; and&#xD;
as I regard you as my confidential clerk, I will communicate&#xD;
my intentions to you. On the first of Januaryneixt Mr. Wil-&#xD;
son will be taken into the firm, which will then be Granville &amp;amp;&#xD;
Wilson."&#xD;
Marion now expressed his sincere satisfaction, and asked if&#xD;
he might congratulate Mr. Wilson upon his good fortune, when&#xD;
he met him at the office. '"He said nothing to me about it at&#xD;
dinner yesterday. In fact he never opened his lips about any&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"Nop-.Wilson is not very talkative. A very excellent qual-&#xD;
ity too in a man. But as he has said nothing to you, I don't&#xD;
think you had better say any thing to him. I suppose that you&#xD;
Know he is living at Mrs. Nordheim's house ?t" observed Mr.&#xD;
Granville.&#xD;
"I really did not know it. When did he go up -there ?"&#xD;
asked Marion.&#xD;
"Very recently. I may as well inform you that I did .not&#xD;
agree to take Mr. Wilson into the house because of his ser-&#xD;
vices, or of his personal importance to-me. I have known him'&#xD;
a great many years. He is a reliable, excellent man, and a&#xD;
most accomplished bookkeeper. He will owe his becoming my&#xD;
partner solely to Mrs. Nordheim. I made a- promise to Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim that 1 would take into partnership any one that his&#xD;
wife should recommend. She has expressed her wishes de-&#xD;
cidledly in favor (of Mr. Richard Wilson:. She also furnishes&#xD;
him with a capital of fifty thousand dollars to put in the new&#xD;
firm. Under these circumstances Mr. Wilson will be admitted&#xD;
a partner. If Mrs. Nordheimn had expressed the wish that you&#xD;

should have been associated with me, it would have given me&#xD;
pleasure to have taken you into partnership. I.am a little sur-&#xD;
prised that she did not do so. It has appeared to me that you&#xD;
were a great favorite in that quarter. Had you any disagree-&#xD;
ment with her ?" demanded'Mr. Granville.&#xD;
" None that I am aware of. She seemed anxious that I&#xD;
should leave her house, and appeared to act somewhat abruptly&#xD;
in requesting me to do so," said Marion.,&#xD;
V " Women are very fantastic in their way of doing things,&#xD;
and Mrs. Nordheim does not seem. to me to be an exception.&#xD;
What has made her take such an interest in Mr. Wilson is be-&#xD;
yond, my comprehension, bVt I suppose they have a secret un-&#xD;
derstanding that Mr. Wilson pays her a portion of the profits&#xD;
he will be pretty certain to make as my partner in business-"&#xD;
observed Mr. Granville.&#xD;
This conversation made a very deep impression upon Ma-&#xD;
rion's mind, in more ways than one-, It set him to thinking of&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheim and Wilson. He wondered what could beher&#xD;
motive. He was not long in doubt. That same day Mrs. Tom&#xD;
Granville found him alone in the parlor.&#xD;
"Marion, it is high time that you and me should have some&#xD;
understanding about Isabella. She has .onfided to me the&#xD;
secret of your mutual- attachment, and I very foolishly con-&#xD;
sented-to keep it from Mr. Granville ; but I must tell you very&#xD;
candidly I think you are both young, and both particularly&#xD;
foolish. Mr. Granville will never consent to your marrying&#xD;
Isabella under present circumstances. He might do so, were&#xD;
you in successful business and making money. What are your&#xD;
future plans ?" she asked.&#xD;
Poor Marion, this was the extra pound that was to break his&#xD;
back. ,He did not know what to say, but he made a sort of&#xD;
answer, and informed Aunt Kate that he really had no definite&#xD;
plans for the future. " I will let things take their regular&#xD;
course. I am going with the current, and I cannot get out of&#xD;
the stream to get ashore," said he.&#xD;
"1I am afraid you will have to get out of the stream very&#xD;
soon, or you will be helped out. Have you not noticed that&#xD;
Colonel Benson is very regular in coming here and are you&#xD;
not aware that his hopeful son generally cones with, his pa-.&#xD;
and also that Mr. Granville takes 'Isabella and myself to the&#xD;
residence of Colonel Benson, and contrives that young Benson'&#xD;
shall see Isabella home ?" remarked Aunt Kate.&#xD;
Marion replied that he was aware of all these facts, but re-&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
.203&#xD;
&#xD;
quested Aunt Kate to inform him more plainly what impres-&#xD;
sion she meant to convey by mentioning these circumstances,&#xD;
"Why, my worthy Marion, if you don't see what it all means,.&#xD;
I do. Middleton Benson is in love with Isabella as much as&#xD;
that thick-headed plodding young man can be in love with any&#xD;
thing, and it will not be long before he will propose-for Bella,&#xD;
and be accepted," replied Mrs. Tom Granville.&#xD;
Accepted, Mrs. Granville f  By whom, pray?   Not by&#xD;
Isabel-she perfectly detests him, to say nothing about her&#xD;
affections being given to me. Pooh! pooh'! You cannot fright-&#xD;
en me with any such notion," observed Marion with some&#xD;
temper.&#xD;
"Marion, I do not want to alarm you, nor is there the least&#xD;
necessity for showing to me any temper. It is all but a waste&#xD;
of words. I cannot alter things, but I have endeavored to&#xD;
kindly put you on your guard. Take it in that light," replied&#xD;
Mrs.. Granville, with calm dignity.&#xD;
"Mrs. Granville, will you answer me one question. Suppose&#xD;
Mr. Benson, Jr. should propose to Bella, would he be accept-&#xD;
ed ?" demanded Marion.&#xD;
"By Mr. Granville, do you mean? Unquestionably he&#xD;
would be. In fact, I think the two old heads have already&#xD;
arranged the matter," replied Mrs. Granville.&#xD;
"No-I mean by Isabella 7" anxiously inquired Marion.&#xD;
"Isabel would not dare refuse him under such circumstances.&#xD;
She would refer him to papa, and although she would cry and&#xD;
take on about it in her room, yet to Mi. Granville she would&#xD;
appear pleased, and when the time came would marry Middle-&#xD;
ton Benson without saying a word," replied Mrs. Tom Gran-&#xD;
Ville.&#xD;
"Great God! I can't believe it. She would never be so&#xD;
false to me," said poor Marion.&#xD;
" False is a hard word. She is a mere child, and when you&#xD;
consented to being engaged to her, you have penetration enough&#xD;
to have formed some idea of her character. I~ think, Master&#xD;
Marion, you have behaved. excessively foolish.  There is no&#xD;
body whose advice is so good as a woman's.. Before you got&#xD;
trammelled with such an attachment, why did you not consult&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheim 7 She always appeared to be a great friend of&#xD;
yours,' asked Mrs. Granville.&#xD;
" Because Isabella requested me not to say a word to any&#xD;
one about the matter," said Marion.&#xD;
" When Isabel told me about it, Mr. Monck, I was extremely&#xD;
eurprised, and I supposed, as a matter of -course, that Mrs.&#xD;

Nordheim knew all about it. When I told her, she was per-&#xD;
fectly paralyzed," observed Mrs. Granville.&#xD;
"In God's name, Mrs. Granville, tell me what you mean.&#xD;
Did you tell her ? and when was it that y6u told her ?" said&#xD;
Marion, excitedly.&#xD;
"I did tell-jMrs. Nordheim, of course, and. the time was the&#xD;
day before you moved here. In fact, she must have requested&#xD;
you to move the very evening of the day that I saw her," re-&#xD;
plied Aunt Kate.&#xD;
"1 And what,'Mrs. Granville, cotild have been her motive for&#xD;
so abrupt-ay, so unkind a proceeding? Why should she be&#xD;
so angry at my becoming attached to Miss Granville," inquired&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
" You are really silly. The very best reason in the world.&#xD;
She did not wish to quarrel with Granville. She knew that&#xD;
he would not consent to your marriage with Isabel, and sensi-&#xD;
ble woman that she is, determined not to be mixed up with it,&#xD;
by countenancing you-so she requested you to move as quick&#xD;
as possible, and told some foolish story about wanting to go&#xD;
into the country. She never did go into the country, .and that&#xD;
is proof that it was but an excuse to get y'ou out of the house,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Granville.&#xD;
"I see it all now," replied Marion. "My eyes are opened.&#xD;
What an infatuated fool I have been. She was. vexed at' my&#xD;
apparent want of confidence, and that is the secret of her cool&#xD;
treatment." Marion was as far from the real reason as ever.&#xD;
Aunt Kate continued to pour oil upon the fire that she had&#xD;
kindled. "I dare say that if you had told her all about your&#xD;
love for Belle, she would have advised with you about it, and&#xD;
as she was very fond of you, it is likely that she would have&#xD;
backed her own advice by acts. Granville is about to take&#xD;
Wilson into partnership. Itis all Mrs. Nordheim'sdoings. Had.&#xD;
yaui acted right with so good a friend as that lady, she would&#xD;
have requested that partnership for you, and Belle's hand into&#xD;
the bargain. Had she done so, Mr. Granville would have con-&#xD;
sented at once. But it is too late now," was the remark of the&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
Marion covered hia face with his hands. His heart was too&#xD;
full to speak. At last he managed to inform  Mrs. Granville&#xD;
that he would like to see Isabel, and-have a full and complete&#xD;
understanding with her. Mrs. Granville replied, " It will be&#xD;
of no use, Marion. She will say yes to all you say. But she&#xD;
will not run away with you, or get married without the consent&#xD;
of her parent. When lie puts his foot down, she will obey&#xD;

&#xD;
him, and marry the man she has chosen, and that will be the&#xD;
end of it. Take my advice, you would at once tell Isabel that&#xD;
you both have been foolish, that both had better give up all&#xD;
hope of the future, and forget each other," said Mrs.Granville.&#xD;
"But Isabel, my dear Mrs. Granville, will not consent to&#xD;
,      any such thing. She loves me truly. Did I not think so, I&#xD;
would never 'give her another thought. She will never con-&#xD;
sent to breaking off our engagement while she is alive," said&#xD;
the confident Marion Mouck.&#xD;
"Nonsense. Try the experiment at. least. It will be for&#xD;
your own happiness to do so, I assure you. Under different&#xD;
circumstances, I dare say you and Isabel might have been very&#xD;
happy, but not now. Good-bye. Think over what I have&#xD;
said, and act precisely as you deem  best," said Mrs. Tom&#xD;
Granville.&#xD;
Marion was completely paralyzed at such advice as this. He&#xD;
did not know which way to turn for relief. He attended to his&#xD;
duties the remainder of the day, and when evening came and&#xD;
it was about time to close the store, his mind was made up to&#xD;
take the advice of a third and a disinterested party. He told&#xD;
the Count Falseehinski that he desired particularly to see him,&#xD;
and asked to meet him that evening at the Fronch coffee house&#xD;
in Warren street.&#xD;
"I will meet you, Marion, but not there. Make it at Del-&#xD;
monico's, in William street. There we can have a room  to&#xD;
ourselves, and a quiet nice dinner, or supper, if you call it so.&#xD;
I have an idea that I could guessthe nature of your seeking -a&#xD;
private conversation with me, but I will not do so. . Be punc-&#xD;
tual to the time, which I wish you would make eight o'clock;&#xD;
do not be later. It is a bitter cold night, and a good cozy&#xD;
room with a fire, and the nice edibles and drinkables -that Del-&#xD;
inonico can get up, will enable us to pass a delightful evening,"&#xD;
replied the Count, and the parties separated.&#xD;

when the Great Fire occurred in New York. Marion left the&#xD;

store from the porter, as he bad previously taken the keys of&#xD;
an immense iron safe or vault, built into the solid walls of the&#xD;
store. He went home to tea, and .after he had finished, Mr.&#xD;
Granville expressed a desire to have a policy of insurance, or&#xD;
to knotr if one had been taken out on property in a -store on&#xD;
the North River side of the town.&#xD;
I shall be over in the neighborhood of our store, and it&#xD;
will cost nme but little trouble to go in and ascertain for~you,"&#xD;
was Marion's reply.&#xD;
"1 wish you would do so," was the answer, and Marion left&#xD;
for Delmonico's, still keeping all the keys with him.&#xD;
The store of Mr. Granville was on the corner of -Broad and&#xD;
Garden street, and its rear overlooked the graveyard attached&#xD;
to the Reformed Church in Garden street, of which Dr. Mat-&#xD;
thews was the pastor.&#xD;
Delmonico's at that time was almost as celebrated as it now&#xD;
is-perhaps more so, as it then had no rivals and no establish-&#xD;
ment of a similar kind could have been found in the city. It&#xD;
was located in William street, on the west side, about midway&#xD;
between Garden and Beaver streets. The eldest brother of&#xD;
the Delmoniico Brothers was then alive. He was a fine-looking&#xD;
man of middle age, and his first name was John. He had an-&#xD;
other brother named Peter.  Since then, -several others have&#xD;
come to this country, while John is long since dead. lHe was&#xD;
accidentally killed while shooting over on Long Island.&#xD;
When Marion reached Delmonico's it wanted but little of&#xD;
the hour appointed. .He found the Count waiting, and soon&#xD;
after a servant showed them up to a nice little dining-room on&#xD;
the second floor, and facing the street.  Soon after the dinner&#xD;
was served, and'a bottle of wine also.&#xD;
"Don't talk about any unpleasant nfatter until we have had&#xD;
our dinner," said the Count-and Marion scrupulously re-&#xD;
frained from the least allusion to his troubles. Over an hour&#xD;
passed away while the Count was enjoying the meal, and then&#xD;
he ordered coffee and cigars.&#xD;
"Now, Marion, I am ready for you. Tell me how I can&#xD;
serve you, and I will do so to an extent that you little dream&#xD;
of. Tell me all, from the beginning to the end."&#xD;
Marion then related what has already been made familiar to&#xD;
our readers. When he had concluded, the Count remarked,&#xD;
"I dare say, Marion, that you consider this unfortunate at-&#xD;
tachment as one of serious importance. Pah! if you could&#xD;
view such things as I do ! Minds change---young men's espe.&#xD;
cially. Could you jump over five years of your existence, you&#xD;
&#xD;
207&#xD;
&#xD;
would laugh heartily at this boyish attachment !to a pretty&#xD;
simpleton, for that is all that Miss Isabel amounts to inder&#xD;
the most favorable circumistances. But I will not laugh at&#xD;
you, for I have been over the same road, and know just how&#xD;
you feel upon this occasion. Mr. Granville will not consent&#xD;
to your marrying Miss Isabel under-any circumstances---and I&#xD;
would not either, if I was he. And if I was your parent, I&#xD;
would cut your throat before you should marry such a useless,&#xD;
insignificant piece of furniture. Pah again! Don't look an-&#xD;
gry, nor don't get angry with what I am going to say. You&#xD;
have the world before you, with health and good looks.  Yes,&#xD;
Marion, you are a devilish good looking fellow, and when you&#xD;
'get a trifle more manly, you will be a splendid specimen of a&#xD;
man. You speak several languages-you -have a thorough&#xD;
mercantile education-and now you would throw all these .ad-&#xD;
vantages away, and tie yourself up with a little silly girl who&#xD;
has not done.eating bread and butter. For shame, man ! I&#xD;
thought you had a high ambition.  If Mr.' Granville would&#xD;
plank down a hundred thousand dollars with the young lady, it&#xD;
might do, but to marry her without his consent and not get a&#xD;
cent-Oh no, it's perfect nonsense.  Don't think of such a&#xD;
thing-it is sheer madness," was the advice given by the expe-&#xD;
rienced Count.&#xD;
But,'mydear Count, although I am half persuaded that&#xD;
you are right, yet how can I help myself?  We love each.&#xD;
other, and we are engaged.- It would not be honorable in me&#xD;
to break off, and I could not do it.  What would she not suf-&#xD;
fer ?" replied Marion.&#xD;
"Not a pin's-head worth--not arparticle. Try it.  Go, to&#xD;
Miss Isabel to-morrow the first ,thing. Tell .her you are satis-&#xD;
fled her father will never consent to your engagement, and that&#xD;
you cannot support a wife, and beg her to give up all thoughts&#xD;
of such an arrangement.  Tell her that your parents won't&#xD;
consent to it. Tell her you have made a promise to me that&#xD;
you won't marry until you are thirty years old, and see how&#xD;
kindly she will take it.  She. won't make the slightest objec-&#xD;
tion. Or if she does, your skirts are clear, and there is no&#xD;
occasion for you to trouble your head any further about the&#xD;
affair. 'I advise you to move out of the house of Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville also., Get some other place to live-it is more indepen-&#xD;
dent," continued the Count, when the alarm of fire occurred.&#xD;
"Fire! . Fire! Fire!" rang through the streets. The&#xD;
Count jumped up, and so did Marion. They flung open the&#xD;
blinds, and could see' by the illuminated sky that it raged near&#xD;

them... Down stairs they rushed. The Count paid the bill,&#xD;
and they were soon in the street. It was nearly ten o'clock,&#xD;
the cold ,was intense, and there was a high wind. They passed&#xD;
rapidly into Exchange street-now Beaver, east of William-&#xD;
and kept on to Pearl. There were few people assembled, but&#xD;
one of the large dry-goods stores a few doors from Wall was in&#xD;
a blaze. They stopped and watched the fire for a short time,&#xD;
and saw it extend westward towards the Merchants' Exchange.&#xD;
"Count, it is very cold to be standing here. I have the keys&#xD;
of the store, and I am sure good coal fires are burning in both&#xD;
ofiices-if not, we can soon make one. We shall freeze if we&#xD;
stop here," observed Marion.&#xD;
The Count agreed to the proposition, and they walked rapidly&#xD;
to the- store of Mr. Granville. Sure enough, they found a&#xD;
good- coal fire burning, and they lit ,a couple of candles and&#xD;
their cigars,- and took seats by the fire. Some short time&#xD;
elapsed when they heard an unusual noise in the street, and&#xD;
Marion said be would go and see how the fire was getting on.&#xD;
He had been out but a moment, as it seemed to the Count,&#xD;
when he returned, his face aghast. "Count, several blocks&#xD;
are on fire, and so is. the Merchants' Exchange. Why, our&#xD;
store may be-in danger!" said Marion.&#xD;
" Nonsense ! To get at us the fire has got to burn a good&#xD;
sized church, -and a pretty large grave-yard. However, we&#xD;
had better stay and sethe business over or the fire out. I&#xD;
shall not go to look at it myself, for I am very comfortable&#xD;
her. Suppose you go to Delmonico's and get some cigars."&#xD;
Marion"started on his errand, but speedily returned : "Del-&#xD;
monico's'is all on fire; there is no getting near the place."&#xD;
"But there are no hells ringing. It is a fire without much&#xD;
noise," remarked the Count.-&#xD;
" People have too much to do to save their things. -Let's&#xD;
both go and look at the fire," said Marion.&#xD;
It was a very remarkable fact that o9 the occasion of the&#xD;
Great Fire in New York, the city bells rang but for a few&#xD;
moments, aud~ while block after block was being burned, there -&#xD;
was a fearful stillness, only interrupted by the roar of the&#xD;
flames.' The Count and Marion got separated, and Marion&#xD;
was alone watching the progress of the fire. It cane down&#xD;
Garden street like a summer whirlwind, and Marion .for the&#xD;
first time became fully conscious that the store of Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville could not escape. He then went to work to get the books&#xD;
of the firm at least to a place of safety. lie felt sure that the&#xD;
fire would not cross Broad street. Luckily, a store was, open&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
209&#xD;
&#xD;
on the opposite side, and he was well acquainted with the peo-&#xD;
ple. He carried thither every book and paper that he regarded&#xD;
as- of any value. When this was accomplished, he took the&#xD;
portfolio, which contained bills of exchange, notes, stock cer-&#xD;
tificates, and other papers of value to the amount of half a mil-&#xD;
lion of dollars. This he carried about his person knowing that&#xD;
its loss could never be replaced. No one arrived to aid him.&#xD;
He went once more into the street: the church in the rear of&#xD;
Mr. Granville's store was on' fire, and Marion then knew that&#xD;
the store was doomed. By this time the authorities had de-&#xD;
termined to blow up buildings and prevent the fire from&#xD;
spreading in Broad street. A store selected to be blown up&#xD;
was at No. 42 Garden, only opposite the corner store of Mr.&#xD;
Granville. From the opposite side of Broad Marion saw that&#xD;
blown up, and fall in one solid mass of ruins-not a brick or&#xD;
stone fell into the street-the store rose up and fell on the&#xD;
ground upon which it was-'built.  .&#xD;
Shortly afterward the store of Mr. Granville caught, and&#xD;
Marion remained on the opposite side of the street and saw it&#xD;
burn and fall a mass of fire; such was the intense heat that&#xD;
not a brick was left standing. While watching' this result, he-&#xD;
was startled by hearing some one exclaim; "My God, I am a&#xD;
ruined man !"  He knew the voice. It was Mr. Granville.&#xD;
'Marion approached him and placed his hand on his shoulder.&#xD;
"It is not so bad as you suppose, Mr. Granville."&#xD;
"The portfolio-where is the portfolio ?" inquired the mer-&#xD;
chant.&#xD;
"I have it, sir, all safe. Here it is," replied Marion.&#xD;
"Thank God for that. All the rest may go," was the re-&#xD;
sponse of the merchant.&#xD;
Marion then conducted him to the spot where he had placed&#xD;
 the books and papers. " Nothing is lost, sir, except the mer-&#xD;
chandise, and that is fully insured.&#xD;
"You have done all this yourself?" asked Mr. Granville.&#xD;
"Yes, sir. In 'a time, like this aid was impossible to be&#xD;
had," was the niodest reply of Marion.&#xD;
"I owe you a debt of gratitude, my dear boy, that I can&#xD;
never repay.. But come, let us get home," said Mr. Granville.&#xD;
It was nearly daybreak when they reached State street, but&#xD;
the fire was burning as madly as ever, and did not stop until it&#xD;
had levelled every house between Broad and Wall street to the&#xD;
East river.&#xD;

THOMAs GRANVILLE seemed to have lost the esteem not only&#xD;
of those with whom he was connected by relationship, but&#xD;
also of the young woman with whom 'he had formed a depen-&#xD;
dent connexion.   She, too, got sick of Tom, -and became-'&#xD;
anxious to terminate their engagement. She was more anxious&#xD;
to do this, as Tom displayed no energy and no manlinQss of&#xD;
character. He was contented to remain by the side of Miss&#xD;
Norris at her comfortable quarters from one 'meal to another.&#xD;
At last she came to the conclusion that she would, for the wel-&#xD;
fare of Tom, rouse him out of his unmanly lethargy at any&#xD;
cost. About the -time of the Great Fire she took Tom.nGranville&#xD;
to task.&#xD;
"Is it-possible that you expect to be tied to my apron-strings&#xD;
for ever? Have you no idea of doing anything" for yourself ?&#xD;
For shame !" she asked.I&#xD;
Tom replied, " I do not know what I can do. What do you&#xD;
wish me to do ?"&#xD;
"Oh, man, man, have you no energy-no self-respect left'?&#xD;
Do ? Why, rather than lead such a miserable life as you are&#xD;
leading, Master Ton, I would go and hire myself out as a&#xD;
street sweeper, carry in coal, go from house to house and offer&#xD;
to clear off the snow from the sidewalks, do any thing to earn&#xD;
my bread, were I a man, or, if like you, I pretended to be&#xD;
one," said the handsome Miss Norris.&#xD;
Such language was calculated to arouse a new spirit in poor&#xD;
Tom, and it succeeded admirably.&#xD;
"1Do you wish to get up a quarrel with me ?  Is that what-&#xD;
you are trying to do'? or do you wish to separate from me'?  I&#xD;
can accommodate you in any way," replied Tom, with some&#xD;
spirit.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Bravo, bravo, Tom. That is excellent. I have not seen&#xD;
you look so becoming in a long while. I will tell you what I&#xD;
want. Be a man; make yourself respected. God forgive me&#xD;
for ever letting you come here. Do you know that all your&#xD;
friends charge me with leading you astray ? seducing your af-&#xD;
fections from a beloved wife ? destroying her peace of mind ?&#xD;
ruining her domestic happiness, and all such sort of stuff,&#xD;
which you, Tom Granville, know is as false as falsehood it-&#xD;
self," continued Miss Norris.&#xD;
" And who dares say such a thing ? It is not true, and you&#xD;
know it all well as I do. Why, then, should you care what&#xD;
people say falsely? Tell me who makes those charges against&#xD;
you. Give me names, and if my brother or my wife even have&#xD;
dared to assert-such atrocious slanders, I will make them con-&#xD;
tradict them," replied Tom, very bravely.&#xD;
" Ah, Tom, if you would only show as much spirit in your&#xD;
actions as you do in your language, I should respect you&#xD;
much more than I do now. I do not want to make enemies,&#xD;
and yet I am making them every day on your account. Your&#xD;
wife has applied for a divorce, and she 'will succeed in getting&#xD;
it, if you do not mind, Tom," observed Miss Norris.&#xD;
"I don't care a straw whether she does or not. What will&#xD;
it matter me ?" inquired Tom.&#xD;
"It matters this much, that if she succeeds in getting a di-&#xD;
vorce, it permits her to marry again, while it debars you from&#xD;
that privilege," remarked Miss Norris.&#xD;
Tom answered that he did not care for a divorce, that 'he&#xD;
should never marry again under any- circumstance, that he had&#xD;
had quite sufficient of' married life, and wished for no more.&#xD;
But he continued, " I see that you wish to get rid of me. Your&#xD;
wishes, Clara, shall be gratified. I will leave you this very&#xD;
day. You shall see me no more."&#xD;
"Nay, Tom," continued Miss Norris, with some feeling. "I&#xD;
wish to see you do something. You have cleverness, use it to&#xD;
some purpose, in some way, I care not how. I have no wish&#xD;
to get rid of you, except for your own good."*-&#xD;
"No matter what the motive is, Clara. We won't speak of.&#xD;
that. You do wish it, and it shall be done. But I have a fa-&#xD;
vor to ask. I need some money for a short time. Lend it to&#xD;
me, and I will return it inside of a month. I am mai enough&#xD;
for that,, at any rate." said Ton.&#xD;
Miss Norris went to a little portable desk, opened it, and.&#xD;
took out a pocket-book.&#xD;
"How much do you want, Tom ?' she asked..&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7714-00000106"/>&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Fifty dollars will answer my purpose," was the reply, and&#xD;
she at once banded him that amount.&#xD;
"-If it is not sufficient, tell me so, and you shall have more,"&#xD;
added Clara, as she held out the purse.&#xD;
No. It is quite enough ;. and now, Clara. good-bye," said&#xD;
Tom.&#xD;
Miss Norris wished to arouse Tom Granlille to make some&#xD;
effort to do some thing for himself, but as she saw determiua-&#xD;
tion in every lineament of Tom's expressive face, she became&#xD;
fearful'that she had overdone the matter. Perhaps Tom was&#xD;
going to jump.-off the dock, or .commit suicide in some other&#xD;
shape. She felt that the melancholy- fate of poor Nordheim,&#xD;
her first friend, had been tragedy enough for her lifetime, and&#xD;
she was not anxious to have Tom get killed, or kill himself.&#xD;
So she changed her battery. "Come, Tom, you need not say,&#xD;
good-bye ; or if you will do so, give me some reason for it.&#xD;
Tell me where are you going. What are you going to do.? 5nd&#xD;
if it is not an impertinent question, when am I. to see your in-&#xD;
dignant lordship again ?"&#xD;
Not a smile appeared upon the face of Tom.  He was ,as&#xD;
calm as apparent insensibility could make him. He felt indig-&#xD;
nant, but he had sense, and he had pride, and these told huim&#xD;
that Miss Norris was acting right. It was a bitter pill to&#xD;
swallow, but he got it down.&#xD;
Clara, I will try and reply to your questions, or I would&#xD;
do so if I could, but I do not really know what I am going to&#xD;
do. I am going to leave New York this very evening, that I&#xD;
have decided upon firmly. So that my good-bye means some-&#xD;
thing.  I shall go to Philadelphia this afternoon.  I have&#xD;
friends there. If nothing opens, I shall keep on to Baltimore,,&#xD;
where I married my wife, and from thence 3 may go still farther&#xD;
south. That is all I can tell you, and once more I say -good-&#xD;
bye."&#xD;
Tom, as he said this, rose and took his hat, and walked&#xD;
partly to the door. Miss Norris followed him.&#xD;
Tom, I shall not say one word to prevent your going. It&#xD;
is necessary for your own sake. May God grant that you may&#xD;
find some thing to do-get into business,'or get some position&#xD;
that will be creditable lo you and toithose connected with you.&#xD;
If you do, perhaps your wife will withdraw, her application.&#xD;
Your brother will receive you as a brother again. I wish you&#xD;
well from the bottom of my heart. I am not selfish when I&#xD;
propose our separation. It is for your good,"' said Clara.&#xD;
Tom replied, "So you have said, Clara4, and I believe you,.&#xD;

On, more good-bye. You shall hear from me favorably, and I&#xD;
thank you for having roused me from my lazy, unmanly sleep."&#xD;
Miss Norris bade him an affectionate farewell, and Tom Gran-&#xD;
ville left the house determined to turn over a new leaf. He&#xD;
did not wait for his resolves, which he felt were good ones, to&#xD;
cool. It was about noon when he left the residence of Miss&#xD;
Norris. -He went from there to a quiet eating-rouse down in&#xD;
Nassau street, and got dinner. That afternoon he started for&#xD;
Philadelphia, and he did not plt for any time until he had gone&#xD;
as far south as the city of Washington.&#xD;
In the chapter where we gave an account of Tom's marrying,&#xD;
we mentioned the conduct of General Jackson in after years,&#xD;
when Thomas Granville came to him in distress and in trou-&#xD;
ble. It was the present trip to which we then' alluded. Pres-&#xD;
ident Jackson took the matter in his own bands, and sent the&#xD;
name of Thomas Granville to the Senate for confirmation as&#xD;
Consul to one of the principal cities of France. He furnished&#xD;
Tom Granville with funds to proceed immediately to New&#xD;
York. Tom was delayed in Baltimore for a few days. Before&#xD;
be reached New York, his appointment and confirmation had&#xD;
been published in all the New York papers. It took all his&#xD;
acquaintances by surprise. "Ah, that brother. of mine. He&#xD;
will never be taken alive," exclaimed Pitt Granville, who had&#xD;
a great admiration of official people, and his brother was now&#xD;
one, thanks to General Jackson's. friendship. No sooner did&#xD;
Thomas Granville reach New York, than he proceeded to his&#xD;
brothel's office. W. Pitt Granville received him kindly, and&#xD;
conducted him into the inner office.  Before Tom left., Gran-&#xD;
ville had promised to let him have all the money he needed for&#xD;
an outfit, and wait for it when Tom  Granville~ should have&#xD;
reached France, and began to pocket the emoluments of the&#xD;
Consulate. It is needless to say that the mere fact of his&#xD;
brother's getting so honorable an appointment abroad was very&#xD;
gratifying to the senior Granville. A thousand or two. thou-&#xD;
sand dollars to send out his brother to France, was nothing, in&#xD;
comparison to the gratification of his own feelings, even if Tom&#xD;
had never remitted back a cent.&#xD;
No sooner had Tom received money frqm his brother, than&#xD;
he at once went to a hotel. There he sat down and wrote a&#xD;
grateful letter to General Jackson, and inclosed the thirty dol-&#xD;
lars the President-had loaned-him.&#xD;
" Your act, General, has made me ascertain that I have more&#xD;
friends than I dreamed of. As you foretold, I have any quan-&#xD;
tity of friends since my appointment became pitblic. I had no&#xD;

difficulty in raising money, and have sufficient not only to re-&#xD;
turn you the thirty dollars which you were so good as to make&#xD;
me take at Washington, but enough left to procure me a hand-&#xD;
some outfit and pay my expense to the port where I am ap-&#xD;
pointed."&#xD;
General Jackson was much gratified with the letter of Tho-&#xD;
mas Granville~iand wrote him in reply a short but expressive&#xD;
letter, urging him to leave New York at the earliest moment,&#xD;
and giving him some good advice as to his conduct while in&#xD;
office.&#xD;
Thomas Granville, after he had dispatched his letter to the.&#xD;
President, found his way up to Broome street. Miss Norris&#xD;
was in ecstacies at his success. "I knew it was in your line,&#xD;
if you only exerted yourself."  She then inquired what the&#xD;
income would be, and into various other matters. Tom said,&#xD;
he should engage passage to Liverpool, and from thence g6 to&#xD;
Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, and other places in England&#xD;
where he. had relations and connexions.&#xD;
You know my wife has some very aristocratic connexions&#xD;
in London. One of her great aunts is the Duchess of Leeds,&#xD;
another is the Marchioness of Carmarthen.:, They were both&#xD;
Baltimore girls, and married well," said Torn.&#xD;
"They know all about your wife; of course ?" inquired Clara.&#xD;
"Certainly. They know of our marriage, and both ladies&#xD;
wrote on letters congratulating us at the time the unfortunate&#xD;
affair came off," -said Tom.&#xD;
"Probably they have heard of your separation fro m your&#xD;
wife ?" inquired Clara, anxiously.&#xD;
"Not a syllable. You may bet your life that I have never&#xD;
uttered a word about it to those grand dames. Nothing has&#xD;
been said about itin the papers or in any public manner, and&#xD;
I am quite sure that my wife and her relations are too cur*&#xD;
sedly mortified about the affair to have written such unpleasant'&#xD;
'news, said Tom Granville.&#xD;
"Thomas Granville," repeated Miss Norris, coming close to&#xD;
him, laying her hands upon his shoulder, and looking him full&#xD;
in the face, "Tom," she continued, "you have said that you&#xD;
loved me. Did you mean it, when you used to say it ?"&#xD;
"Upon my soul i did, Clara; I do love you," answered Tom&#xD;
Granville, returning her look.&#xD;
The lady- did not alter her position. -" Thomas, will you&#xD;
prove it ? Will you take me with you to France ?" .&#xD;
" You, Clara ! You ! But will you go ? No, no ! I were&#xD;
mad to think of such a thing. It would d--n all uxy prospects&#xD;

forever. Great God, what a regular row it would kick up!&#xD;
No, Clara, it would not do. It wouldn't pay. What would&#xD;
v9',&#xD;
Granville say.&#xD;
"Listen to me, Tom Granville. Your brother, the Presi-&#xD;
dent none of your friends need to know any thing of the mat-&#xD;
ter. You go to work, get your outfit-.-uniform, letters, com-&#xD;
mission, letters of introduction. Engage passage, and do every&#xD;
thing that you have got to do, as though I were not. going. I&#xD;
will secure my passage in the same ship, but under another&#xD;
name. When we reach Liverpool, we can then travel toge-&#xD;
ther, and then what a chance of your paying off your wife old&#xD;
scores! Take me as your wife--introduce me to the haughty&#xD;
dames who are her connexions, and see what glorious times we&#xD;
shall have. After leaving England, I can go with you to Paris&#xD;
-then follow you to your post-take a little cottage in the&#xD;
suburbs of the city. 0 Tom, it will be so nice--so quiet, and&#xD;
we can be so happy," said Miss Norris.&#xD;
Ah, Tom Granville, where was your'better angel when this&#xD;
artful syren was pouring such ideas into your confused brain ?&#xD;
Consul Granville agreed to the entire programme as marked&#xD;
out by the artful Clara, and it was eventually carried out in all&#xD;
its details. Clara sold off all her furniture and everything of&#xD;
value, and placed the money in the Sussex Bank. She went&#xD;
up and bade her parents good-bye.&#xD;
When the day for sailing came, Thomas Granville had an&#xD;
abundance of friends to see him off. His brother Pitt Gran-&#xD;
ville and a large party went on board the ship, and came up in&#xD;
the steamboat. Little did any one dream that Miss Norris&#xD;
was on board, under an assumed name. Yet so it was, and the&#xD;
shi left the hook with a fair breeze for her destination.&#xD;
-[I is not in our power to give an account of all that befell&#xD;
Thomas Granville during the period he was absent from the&#xD;
United States. He reached England, and so did Miss Norris.&#xD;
She travelled with him far and wide as his wife. His family&#xD;
received her as such, and the haughty relations, the two per-&#xD;
sons to whom we have alluded, made much of their American&#xD;
relations. Tom and his supposed wife were feted in the most&#xD;
sumptuous. manner. The relatives of Mrs. Tom Granville&#xD;
were very much delighted with their relation, as represented&#xD;
by Miss Norris. But at last her intrigues -became noticed,&#xD;
and Tom hurried her over to Paris. There they became worse,&#xD;
and although she kept a purse separate from Tom, before he&#xD;
had resided at his post~ a year she had coined money in abun-&#xD;
dance, while he was impoverished., She left him for London,&#xD;

and there her position enabled her to carry- on several liasons,&#xD;
that brought her in enormous sums of money. She played a&#xD;
high game, and she won. Ere a, year elapsed, she was back&#xD;
again in New York. She had been missed, but no one knew,&#xD;
.where she had gone.&#xD;
There came letters to the Pinckney family in Baltimore from&#xD;
the English princesses. They had met Mrs. Tomn Granville,&#xD;
and were delighted with her. This produced an explosion,&#xD;
but who was playing so impudent a part became the next ques-&#xD;
tion. Pitt Granville's relations also wrote to hitm about Mrs.&#xD;
Tom Granville. An explanation followed. The American&#xD;
minister in Paris wrote the President all about it. Tom Gran-&#xD;
ville was recalled or removed just one year from the day he&#xD;
left New York. Miss Norris preceded him only a month, But'&#xD;
she had a great lark, with lots of fun and frolic. She had&#xD;
moved in the highest circles in England and France. She had*&#xD;
travelled all over the continent; and practiced the languages&#xD;
she had learned from the Count Falsechinski, and made her-&#xD;
self perfect in all of them. During her sojourn in England,,&#xD;
and while upon the continentsof Europe, she -never forgot'for&#xD;
a single moment one purpose. As we have before stated, she&#xD;
was engaged in intrigues constantly, but they were not of a low&#xD;
character.. She passed along as the beautiful and gifted wife&#xD;
of an American official, and she took care that under that as-&#xD;
sumed position, all those nobles and gallants who followed in&#xD;
her train, or who succeeded in their designs, were -men that&#xD;
had an unlimited control of money. The costly. jewelry and&#xD;
presents which she received were enormous. She carried over&#xD;
from London. to Paris a sum equivalent to twenty-five hundred&#xD;
dollars in cash, and she had not. been ,in Paris a week before&#xD;
she opened a bank account with the American Banking House&#xD;
of Welles &amp;amp; Co., and before the expiration of another week&#xD;
she purchased from that house a bill on New York for twenty-&#xD;
two hundred dollars. This she remitted to her lawyer in New&#xD;
Jersey, with directions to pay off the mortgage of two thousand&#xD;
dollars anil the interest and other expenses. Then she com-&#xD;
menced flirtation in Paris, until she made her supposed hus-&#xD;
band, Consul Granville, the laughing stock of all his friends in&#xD;
Paris. She~then formed an intimacy with a Russian nobleman'&#xD;
of unbounded wealth, and under his protection visited the prin-&#xD;
cipal capitals of Europe. She wheedled her Russian admirer&#xD;
out of a large sum. Soon after her return to 'Paris she gave&#xD;
him the shp. converted all her funds nto a good .draft on New&#xD;
York,-'went down to Havre, and took, passage in the ship Erie.&#xD;

On her arrival she passed from the ship to 1ew Jersey, and'at&#xD;
Newton deposited her money in the Bank. She, stayed but a&#xD;
few weeks with her parents. The mortgage of two thousand&#xD;
dollars had been paid off, and she was the owner of a fine farm.&#xD;
Her father was a sober, industrious man. Her brother and-&#xD;
sister she sent to a neighboring town to school. These duties&#xD;
accomplished, she soon after started for New York. Here she&#xD;
found Tom Granville, irretrievably ruined and disgraced. His&#xD;
brother Pitt Granville had had his feelings outraged, and he&#xD;
would no longer recognize Tom as a brother.&#xD;
Poor Tom. He managed to get the address of Clara Norris,&#xD;
who had become more beautiful and more accomplished, but at&#xD;
the same time more 'heartless than eier. She gave him a few&#xD;
dollars, and at the same time announced to him that all inti-&#xD;
iacy was at an end, except she should be pleased to have him&#xD;
call upon her occasionally. She was residing with Mrs. Wood-&#xD;
ruff, in Bond Street. Thomas Granville asked her if she in-&#xD;
tended to keep him in money any longer?&#xD;
"No Tom-not again. I am going to lead a life after my&#xD;
own fancy. I shall be in this house but a few days, and then I&#xD;
am going to follow the bent of my own inclinations. I hope&#xD;
you are satisfied '' she asked, in a cruel manner.&#xD;
This was all the information Tom could get, except she pro-&#xD;
mised that when she got settled, she would write a note to him,&#xD;
and she 'told him not to call again at Mrs. Woodruff's, but that&#xD;
if he wished to see or communicate with her, to send a letter&#xD;
addressed to her, care of Mrs. Woodruff; and he then took his&#xD;
leave.&#xD;

company was irretrievably ruined, and ,the merchant whose&#xD;
goods were fully insured, soon found that the companies where&#xD;
he had insured would not pay ten cents upon the dollar. The&#xD;
loss of Mr. Granville was very heavy.' His warehouse in Broad&#xD;
street was filled with valuable merchandise, and he had ano.-&#xD;
ther large store in the burnt district with an amount of almost&#xD;
equal value. He felt this loss very acutely. Had the fire&#xD;
occurred a few weeks later, it would have found Mr. Wilson a&#xD;
partner, and also a severe sufferer. The arrangement of hav..-&#xD;
ing Mr. Wilson come into the firm, with a considerable cash&#xD;
capital, was now a matter of extensive moment to Mr. Granville.&#xD;
He stated' frankly to the: former that 'his 'losses were very&#xD;
heavy, and added,6" I shall not insist upon your complying&#xD;
with the agreement we had concluded, unless you are perfectly&#xD;
satisfied that my losses have in no way impaired my solvency."&#xD;
Mr. Wilson advised fully with Mrs. Nordheim, and then in-&#xD;
formed Mr. Granville that he should become a partner accord..&#xD;
ing to agreement, on the approaching first of January. When&#xD;
that day came, the announcements were made in the daily&#xD;
journals, and the firm Was changed to "Granville &amp;amp; Wilson."&#xD;
Mr. Wilson had resided some time with Mrs. Nordheim be-&#xD;
fore he discovered a suitable house. He did find one, how-f&#xD;
ever, for sale, and it was purchased, and Mrs. Nordheiim gave&#xD;
up her house in Bond street, and moved into her own resi-&#xD;
dence. It was a three story house, not in a fashionable part&#xD;
of the town, but in a street running from the west end of the&#xD;
Military Parade Ground, now known as Washington Square.&#xD;
Shortly after their removal Mr. Wilson invited Marion Monck&#xD;
to call upon them. He did so, and was pleasantly scolded by&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheim for his long absence; and she pleasantly .in-&#xD;
quired after the health of his fascinating friend, Miss Isabella&#xD;
Granville. This was a sore subject to Marion, and he skillfully&#xD;
avoided it by saying that he saw so little of Isabella that he&#xD;
did .not really know whetlir she was well or ill. Mrs. Nord-&#xD;
heim then inquired particularly about old friends and acquain.-&#xD;
tances, the Count Falsechinski, Thomas Granville and Miss&#xD;
Norris. Marion told her that Tom had received a foreign ap-.&#xD;
pointment, and of Miss Norris he knew nothing. He congra-&#xD;
tulated Mrs. Nordheim upon her new residence, and with' a&#xD;
promise to call often, took his leave. After he was gone, the-&#xD;
beautiful widow sat and mused for a long time.&#xD;
"What curious beings we are! There is-that lad, Marion-.&#xD;
I thought I loved him. Perhaps I did so-why, I cannot 'tell&#xD;
myself. Now I would no more think of making him my hus.-&#xD;

band, than I would of marrying a child. I want some-one that&#xD;
I can lean upon -some one.that I can trust. 'This youth is as&#xD;
changeable and unstable as water. Had I not discovered that&#xD;
he loved Isabella Granville--well, it is all for the best, and I&#xD;
am fortunate in getting rid of my attachtnent, or what I thought&#xD;
was such, so easily;' and here the lady drew a long sigh. - At&#xD;
this moment Mr. Wilson entered the sitting-room.&#xD;
,"Good evening, my old friend. I have had a visitor. I&#xD;
wish you could have arrived a little sooner. You would have&#xD;
seen how perfectly calta I received a visit-from Mariop Monck.&#xD;
Pshaw! what dupes we are to our own imaginings ! I really&#xD;
fancied that I had a strong regard for that youth. I find he is&#xD;
no more to me than a hundred others," said the widow Nord-&#xD;
heim.&#xD;
.'Iam very happy that you are able to meet him w'th such&#xD;
composure. I feared it would be otherwise. But you have a&#xD;
brave heart," replied Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
" And a good one, too, I hope. Have you just left the&#xD;
office ?"&#xD;
"'About half an hour ago. All was going on well in that&#xD;
quarter. Mr. Granville has. been terribly scared, and is a&#xD;
much more sociable sort of partner than I ever thought he&#xD;
would make. He consults or advises with me in reference to&#xD;
every matter of importance. Such a change in the tenor of&#xD;
any one man's life I have never heard of. From the neglected&#xD;
bookkeeper I am become a prominent merchant, and treated&#xD;
with the utmost respect by all with whom I come in contact.&#xD;
It is you, dear lady, that has-done all this, and how can I ever&#xD;
repay you ?" demanded Mr. I.ilson. "But one thing you&#xD;
shall know-I fear that my residence with you exposes me to&#xD;
be talked about, and I would rather go and live somewhere&#xD;
else---on your account, lady, not on mine," continued honest&#xD;
Wilson.&#xD;
" Who dare talk about me, Mr. Wilson, or what can any one&#xD;
say in reference to my conduct ? Surely I am doing no harm,"&#xD;
said the widow, with great spirit.&#xD;
"I ought not to have said anything about it to worry you,&#xD;
but I could not help it. People joke me. Even Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville said with a sneer this morning, that as you had behaved&#xD;
very kind to me, that I ought to be very careful of your repu-&#xD;
tation, and that I ought not to reside in the house with you,"&#xD;
'stammered out poor Wilson.&#xD;
" I begin to think they are all right, Mr. Wilson. It is curi-&#xD;
ous. It must appear singular that a merchant who has been a&#xD;

clerk should reside alone in the house of one of his late e*-*&#xD;
ploy ers. It must be remedied, Mr. Wilson-we must give no&#xD;
occasion to people to make severe remarks, or to talk scandal&#xD;
about us. What can be done, Mr. Wilson? You are older&#xD;
and wiser than me, and I look to you for correct advice.. You&#xD;
are twice my own age. I am but a little girl in years," said&#xD;
the lively widow.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson reflected a moment before he attempted to make&#xD;
any reply. Then he answered quietly, "Although it may put'&#xD;
you to soige inconvenience, yet I think it would be better that&#xD;
I should move back to my old quarters at Clarke &amp;amp; Brown s in&#xD;
Maiden Lane. I could come up here every day. Then I am&#xD;
-sure the woifd could see no impropriety in you."&#xD;
" That is your candid opinion, is it, Mr. Wilson?  Now it is&#xD;
not-mine. I have a better plan, and not half so troublesoine.&#xD;
Come and-sit down by me on the sofa, and I will tell you what&#xD;
my plan is," said the widow.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson seated himself as requested. She reached her-&#xD;
hand out and gently took hold of his, and continued : "I have&#xD;
told you that I needed a protector. Suppose, Mr. Wilson, I&#xD;
could" find a nice, amiable, kind-hearted, middle-aged man, who&#xD;
would be willing to marry me. What would you think of that&#xD;
plan ?"&#xD;
Poor Wilson was aghast. "Really,, Mrs. Nordheim, I-&#xD;
yes, perhaps it would be, best. But could you love such a man&#xD;
as you describe ?  He must be a wretch if he did not love you&#xD;
and make you happy.. It would be better. I know you have&#xD;
selected the man, or you would not talk so decidedly. Do I&#xD;
know him ? You must confide in me, and tell me his name. I&#xD;
will then tell you honestly what I think of him."&#xD;
Poor Wilson had made a terrible long speech, but it was an&#xD;
honest one. He was much too humble in his own eyes to&#xD;
dream for a moment of the real person that the widow had in&#xD;
view, and he was fearful that it was Colonel Mac Neil, or per-&#xD;
haps the Count Falseehinski. Had a thunderbolt fallen at his&#xD;
feet, he could not have been more startled than when Mrs.&#xD;
Nordheim replied,&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Wilson, it is right and proper that I should tell&#xD;
you the name of the man I intend to ask to become my hus-&#xD;
band. ' It is Richard Wilson," said the widow firmly.&#xD;
"Me !" he exclaimed. "My God! can you be in earnest,&#xD;
or is this a dream ? This is too much honor, too much happi-&#xD;
ness for a poor old devil like me."&#xD;
" It is you, Mr. Wilson-that is if you will have me. I will&#xD;

try and be a good, loving wife. I will try to make you hap.&#xD;
py ;" and she gazed fondly into his face with those clear, beau.&#xD;
tiful eyes, as she said this.&#xD;
"Mrs. Nordheim !" was all Wilson could say,&#xD;
"Don't call me- Mrs. Nordheim-call' me Bessy; for you&#xD;
shall have that right, and no one living but you."&#xD;
I really don't know what to say. I do love you. If you&#xD;
wish it I will marry you-but it is not right. You are very&#xD;
young-gifted, beautiful, rich, and can marry, any one yoi&#xD;
choose-the very pick of the land; and I am a poor old fel-&#xD;
low, double your age, and old enough to be your father. Don't&#xD;
think of it-don't make such a sacrifice !" earnestly exclaimed&#xD;
Wilson.s&#xD;
aIt is no sacrifice at all, Mr. Wilson. If you are old enough&#xD;
to be my father, then you can act father as well as husband,&#xD;
and I will be a dutiful daughter as well as wife, It shall be&#xD;
so, unless you refuse me altogether,' she said smilingly.&#xD;
"() no, dear Bessy! I woulddie for.you, and would be as&#xD;
-devoted to your interest if you had selected some one else;&#xD;
but if you will marry me, why you will make me the happiest&#xD;
man alive," said Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
"Then, my dear Richard, you are satisfied. So am I. Let&#xD;
our marriage be as soon as you please. We will have no fuss&#xD;
or noise.  Send for a clergyman and witnesses to-morrow-&#xD;
next week-.or any time you choose : we.will be married, and&#xD;
then all the notice that we will give about it to our dear friends&#xD;
will be when they will see the announcement in the papers.&#xD;
Are you satisfied, Richard ?"&#xD;
Poor Dick Wilson was overcome. He seized the fair widow,&#xD;
and pressed her to his manly bosom as though heavould never&#xD;
R      release her. Then he kissed her rc-sy lips, but she offered no&#xD;
3,     resistance, to either demonstration, but returned his caresses&#xD;
fondly but gently.&#xD;
"1Bessy, I am forty years old !" he exclaimed.&#xD;
"9Richard, I am twenty-two years oldi" and. she laughed&#xD;
heartily. "I would not have you a year younger for anything.&#xD;
I respect, esteem, trust you; and, dear Richard, don't fear&#xD;
but that I shall learn to love you as fondly as if you were only&#xD;
twenty. I need one thatlI can rely upon in my love, and you&#xD;
are that one; and I shall give you all the wealth that I possess&#xD;
of worldly goods, but I 'Shall give you what you will value&#xD;
more--all the wealth of the most devoted affection," said the&#xD;
widow.&#xD;
.Wilson embraced her again and again. His heart was too&#xD;

full to speak, but he murmured, "Dear lady, you shall never&#xD;
regret your choice."&#xD;
" I don't believe I ever shall, Richard. I will trust you&#xD;
with my future happiness without a doubt. Now let us talk&#xD;
quietly over the future."&#xD;
They did so, until a late hour. Mr. Wilson urged delay in&#xD;
the marriage. He was anxious that she should have time to'&#xD;
think- it over. Perhaps she would change her mind. The&#xD;
lady was resolved&#xD;
A few days elapsed after the conversation, and then Richard&#xD;
Wilson and Elizabeth Nordheim went together in a carriage,&#xD;
one beautiful morning, to the residence of the Rev. Dr. Milner,&#xD;
in Beekman street. There they met Mr. Pitt Granville, Mrs.&#xD;
Tom and Isabella. Marion had not been invited. Mr. Wilstn&#xD;
had two friends there. These parties were witnesses, and the.&#xD;
venerable clergyman performed the ceremony of marriage.&#xD;
From the clergyman's residence the small bridal party drove&#xD;
directly to the house of Mr. Wilson. A table had been spread&#xD;
with refreshments, and all partook of them. Mr. Granville&#xD;
then began to make excuses, and said he must go to the office.&#xD;
" Take Mr. Wilson with you. Mr. Granville. I do not want&#xD;
him to vary his usual habits. He has not been absent from his&#xD;
post for years, and I do not want to kill him on our marriage&#xD;
day by making him give up one of his old habits," said the fair&#xD;
bride.&#xD;
A laugh was the consequence of this playful-sally, and Mr.&#xD;
Wilson, after kissing his wife, joined Mr. Granville and went&#xD;
to the office.1&#xD;
The rest of the bridal party took leave of the bride, and she&#xD;
was left alone. "Poor dear Wilson !" she murmured, "how&#xD;
perfectly astonished he appears to be.' I dare say he thinks&#xD;
it all a dream. Never mind--it shall be a happy dream, and&#xD;
I will begin by making him completely at, his ease, and act as&#xD;
though nothing -remarkable had happened.  What a lucky&#xD;
thought to send him dqwn to the store! How delighted he&#xD;
was to get off! I do love him. But now for dinner. I must&#xD;
begin to see about that, for he will be back here to dinner as&#xD;
punctual as the clock."&#xD;
Thas commenced the wedded life of Mr. and Mrs. Wilson.&#xD;

WaEN Mr. Granville, accompanied by Mr. Wilson, reached&#xD;
the counting-room, (which was now heated, after the fire, lower&#xD;
down Broad street., on the opposite side to where the old store&#xD;
stuod) he announced to the Count Falsechinski and to Marion&#xD;
Monek and the other clerks, the event that had occurred that&#xD;
morning. All immediately pressed around the new married&#xD;
man, and offered him their sincere congratulatio-ns and. good&#xD;
wishes. None were more sincere than the Count.- Marion,&#xD;
without exactly knowing why, was embarrassed. He felt hurt&#xD;
that he had not been asked to the wedding. He was not con-&#xD;
scious of feeling deeper upon the subject than this.  In the&#xD;
course of the day he found himself alone with the Count, and&#xD;
he remarked to him, "Count, don't you think it very queer&#xD;
that Mrs. Nordheim, let alone Wilson, did not invite me to the&#xD;
wedding ?"&#xD;
"Marion," replied the Count, "allow me to say that T can-&#xD;
didly think you are a perfect ninny-a blind male mole..-an&#xD;
ignoramus-a jackass-and if I knew any other term to express&#xD;
the most consummate stupidity, I would apply it to you."&#xD;
A . Marion sprung off his office stool.&#xD;
"Count, what do you mean?    Do you wish to insult me&#xD;
"Not at all, my dear-boy ; but you are so queer, so ex--&#xD;
tremely so, that I cannot put up with you any longer. Invite&#xD;
you ?. That would have been cool. No, no, my dear child:&#xD;

were making an infernal fool of yourself, and falling in love&#xD;

Nordheim sent you away from her house that day, for it was&#xD;
only on being told that you loved another, that the lovely lady&#xD;
discovered the nature of her feelings to you.  She acted&#xD;
wisely, and got rid of you, determined to forget you. She is&#xD;
an affectionate disposition. She found sympathy in Wilson.&#xD;
He is a devilish good fellow. She wanted some body that she&#xD;
could love and respect at the same time. She put Wilson in&#xD;
business-took him to her home, and-to-day she has married&#xD;
him. She has done well, and mark my words, there will not&#xD;
be a happier married.couple in New York than these two. I&#xD;
know them both. Now, are you not an idiot ? . Such chances&#xD;
-and you let them slip ! Now get rid of that other affair. Get&#xD;
off with Miss Isabella, as I advised you the night of the fire, or&#xD;
you will regret that, for the moment Mr. Granville suspects&#xD;
that, he will start you out of his house and out of -his employ.&#xD;
The girl is a heartless coquette, and she would not cross the'&#xD;
street -to pick you out of the gutter, if you happened to fall into&#xD;
it. What! not a word in reply ?" demanded the Count.&#xD;
"No, Count; I have nothing to say. I see through it all&#xD;
now. My eyes are opened. Why did you not tell me about&#xD;
Mrs. Nordheim before ?" asked Marion.&#xD;
" Itell you ! That is cool. Why, my -dear boy, it would&#xD;
have done noigood. Salt could not have saved you. The mo-&#xD;
ment Kate Granville informed Mrs. Nordheim about your affair&#xD;
with Isabella, your cake was dough. A- woman that loves,&#xD;
when.. he hears that the one she loves is also in love with-&#xD;
another woman. Bah. It is no use talking thus. The affair&#xD;
is all over; but cheer up, mait, the world has not come to an&#xD;
en d, and although Mrs. Nordhein has become Mrs.Wilson, and&#xD;
Miss Granville will shortly become Mrs. Benson, yet there is&#xD;
still as good fish in the sea as ever were caught, and will be&#xD;
many more by the time you are thirty years old, and if you&#xD;
think of getting married before that period of your age,. you&#xD;
are perfectly insane," exclaimed the Count.&#xD;
Marion was in no humor to combat the Count's remarks. He&#xD;
felt convinced, and wanted time to think. He only replied&#xD;
with a few words.&#xD;
"Count, if I do not say mgeh, it is because I feel just as&#xD;
though I should like to go and stretch myself. That will do.&#xD;
me good. .I am going to walk for an hour with a gentleman on&#xD;
the Battery. Not a very agreeable companion at this moment-.&#xD;
It is myself."&#xD;
" Go along, my boy ; and whatever may chance to turn up,&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
do not forget that Adolph Falsechinski is your friend," cheer.&#xD;
ingly said the Count.&#xD;
Marion sauntered down to the Battery, and he had not&#xD;
walked there many minutes before he was joined by Isabella&#xD;
Granville.&#xD;
"Why, Isabella, I thought you were up at the wedding&#xD;
which came off this morning," said Marion.&#xD;
'-So I was, dear Marion ; but I have been back some time.&#xD;
I saw you on the Battery, and I ventured to come and take a&#xD;
walk with you. Was Pa at the store when- you came away ?"&#xD;
she asked.&#xD;
"He was," replied Marion; "and I have no reason to supi&#xD;
pose he will leave there until late."&#xD;
" A curious wedding this morning. Were you not sur-&#xD;
prised at it,' Marion? and how did it happen that you were not&#xD;
present ?" she asked.&#xD;
"I was not invited. In fact, I knew nothing about it.'&#xD;
"Were you not surprised at it ?" asked.Isabella.&#xD;
"Nothing surprises me now. I should not be surprised&#xD;
were you to get married to some person that I never heard of.&#xD;
before," said Marion.&#xD;
"You appear quite vexed. this morning. I hope you are not&#xD;
angry with me," softly whispered the young lady.&#xD;
"No, Isabella; not with you. I am vexed with myself, I&#xD;
could tell you a very singular story, if I chose to do so. Isa-&#xD;
bella, you know that Mrs. Nordheim was once a friend of mine&#xD;
--a warm friend."&#xD;
"I very much suspect, Marion, that she was once very much&#xD;
in love with you," replied Isabella.&#xD;
"She certainly treated me with kindness until the day your&#xD;
Aunt Kate went up to her house, and under pretence of con-&#xD;
sulting with her, contrived to let her into our secrets, and told&#xD;
her that you and me were engaged. That night, Isabella, Mrs.&#xD;
Nordheim gave me a hint to go-no-not a hint; she told me&#xD;
she wished me to leave her house as speedily as possible.'. I&#xD;
did so, and since then she has exhibited no kindness to me.&#xD;
On the contrary, not inviting me to her wedding this morning,&#xD;
was in perfect keeping with her other acts," said Marion,&#xD;
"An'd poor me is the cause of this ill-treatment, which you&#xD;
seem to take so much at heart. What need you care for Mrs.&#xD;
Nordheim, orfor Mrs. Wilson as she now is? She can be&#xD;
nothing more to you," said Isabella.&#xD;
indeedd she cannot be. But say no more of her, but let us&#xD;

speak of our own future. You love me, Isabella, do you not ?"&#xD;
asked Marion.&#xD;
" How can you doubt it, dear Marion? I have told you so a&#xD;
hundred times," replied Isabella.&#xD;
"I did a very wrong thing, Isabella, when I consented to be&#xD;
engaged to you, to agree not to mention it to your father. I&#xD;
have felt mean ever since. I have lost my own manliness of&#xD;
character. I wish, dearest Isabella, you would tell me this&#xD;
morning, 'Go to my father. Tell him all, and when he asks&#xD;
me if I love you, I will say yes, and leave the consequence to&#xD;
Providence. We shall both feel easier. We shall have- done&#xD;
right, and our minds will be relieved.' What do you say, Isa-&#xD;
bella 1  Say yes," said Marion.&#xD;
The fair, but treacherous young coquette held down her&#xD;
head, and walked some distance before she opened her lips.&#xD;
Then it was to say, "But, Marion, 'it is perfectly useless. Pa&#xD;
would dismiss you from the store and from the house.".&#xD;
" But," pleaded 'Marion, "I could bear that even, provided&#xD;
you assure me solemnly that you willstill be constant and true,&#xD;
and continue to love me until I am in a different situation, and&#xD;
that if the worst comes to the worst, that if your father cannot&#xD;
be persuaded to give his consent to- our marrying, that you&#xD;
will be mine without his consent. Assure me of this, and ere&#xD;
I sleep to-night, your father shall know all," said Marion.&#xD;
" You will do.nothing of the kind if you really love me, as&#xD;
you say you do. Pa would kill me outright. He made me&#xD;
consent to marry Middleton Benson, although you know I per.&#xD;
febtly detest that young man. But what could I do? Don't.&#xD;
stare at me in that furious manner.; you quite frighten me,"&#xD;
exclaimed poor Isabella.&#xD;
Marion had stopped suddenly in his walk when, Isabella&#xD;
made this queer statement, and gazed fixedly into her face. At&#xD;
last he spoke, and it was with such concentrated bitterness&#xD;
that the young lady began to weep.&#xD;
" Isabel, how deeply, devotedly I have loved you, God alone&#xD;
knows; but what are you ? A trifling, silly, nonsensical doll,&#xD;
baby, or are you a young girl of principle, character and firm-&#xD;
ness?  Tell me at once, and truly, all the. facts you have hint-&#xD;
ed at. Has young Benson offered his hand to you, and when?"&#xD;
" Oh, some days ago. Pa told me he would do so, and that&#xD;
he and old Colonel Benson had arranged it all. What could I&#xD;
do? The young man called. He told me he loved me and all&#xD;
that sort of thing, and asked me if I would marry him," re-&#xD;
plied poor Isabel, crying.&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;

&#xD;
"And you, Isabel," exclaimed Marion in tones somewhat&#xD;
agitated and rather sternly-" what did you reply ?"&#xD;
He took her hand in his, and led her to one of the benches.&#xD;
"I am very caln, Isa. Sit down quietly now, and tell me all&#xD;
about it. Of course you appealed to his honor-you told him&#xD;
that you had long loved me-that we were engaged, and-&#xD;
and-" said Marion,&#xD;
"No, I did not do any thing of 'the sort," said .Isabel.&#xD;
"What did you say then when he asked you if you woiild&#xD;
marry him ?" nervaously inquired Marion.&#xD;
"Why, I.had to tell him yes, of course-what else could I&#xD;
say ?" pleaded Isabella.&#xD;
Marion dropped the pretty little hand which he had held in&#xD;
his, and in the most indignant manner addressed the, poor&#xD;
-silly girl--&#xD;
" I am ashamed that I should ever have lost my heart to&#xD;
you. You profess to love me, and say yes to a proposal of&#xD;
marriage from another! Oh Isabel, had any one else 'told me&#xD;
this of you, I would have crammed the words down his throat.&#xD;
Do you love that young man ?" asked Marion calmly.&#xD;
"*No, I don't," was the reply of Miss Granville.&#xD;
"And yet you agree to marry him when he asks you!"&#xD;
I had to do it," said Isabella.&#xD;
"And do you intend to marry him ?" asked Marion.&#xD;
I suppose so: what else can I do ?" replied Isabella.&#xD;
"Do you mean, dear Isabel, that you would do any thing&#xD;
else' to avoid this proposed marriage ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I will. I don't like young Benson, and I do love&#xD;
you,"-was her reply.  .          #&#xD;
"Then, Isabel, let us walk up to the Bowling Green. There&#xD;
are cairiages always stalling there.  We will enter one of&#xD;
them, and proceed to the same clergyman's residence who mar-&#xD;
ried Mrs. Nordheim this morning. He will marry us. As soon&#xD;
as the ceremony is performed I will go and' tell the, whole to&#xD;
your father ; he will forgive us. Only reflect how gratefully&#xD;
he has expressed himself at my saving his portfolio and books&#xD;
from the fire. Come, Isabel, say you will consent, and I will&#xD;
make you the happiest little wife that ever 'drew breath," and&#xD;
again the little hand was clasped in hers, and he seated him-&#xD;
self at her side.&#xD;
" Why, Marion, what are you thinking of! I would not go&#xD;
in this dress, and if I was to go home and change it, Aunt&#xD;
.Kate would smell a rat, and then there would be such a to-do.&#xD;
-Oh no, don't think of it any more," said Isabel.&#xD;

" Really, Isabel, you would tire out the patience of a saint.&#xD;
The dress. is nothing ; if you love me you will marry me, and,&#xD;
then all will be soon settled. Your father will consent.  But&#xD;
if you will not go now, will you make your arrangements, and&#xD;
run away with me the first good chance you get-say this eve-&#xD;
ning ?" earnestly demanded Marion.&#xD;
"I can't this evening. I am going to a party at Colonel&#xD;
Benson's, and I would not miss going there for all the world.&#xD;
Why need we go and get married?  Pa will kill us both if we&#xD;
do.. Let him have his own way. It will b.e a great deal bete&#xD;
ter," replied Isabel Granville.&#xD;
" Isabel, is this trifling upon so serious a -subject right ?&#xD;
Say that you will not marry me, and then I shall know what to&#xD;
do," said Marion.&#xD;
"I will marry you-that is, I like you better than that stu--&#xD;
pid Benson, if Pa will consent; but there it is again, he will&#xD;
not consent, and what can I do ?" observed Isabella-&#xD;
"If your father was to ask you, Isabel, if you loved me,&#xD;
what would you say, Daisy ??'&#xD;
"If Pa appeared to be angry when he asked me, I should&#xD;
say 'No.' If he appeared pleased I would say 'Yes.' It&#xD;
would depend altogether upon circumstances. What else&#xD;
could I do ?" replied the fair girl.&#xD;
" My poor Isabel, I pity you from the bottom of my heart,&#xD;
but I will not be in suspense longer.  I will know  my. fate,&#xD;
to-night. Come, let us walk towards the house.  Take my&#xD;
arm," said the angry young man.&#xD;
Theytwalked to the house, and Marion bade the young lady'&#xD;
good-bye. From the hQuse he went directly to the office. Mr.&#xD;
Wilson had gone home and Mr. Granville was alone in his pri-&#xD;
vate office.  When Marion entered the counting-room, the&#xD;
Count looked at him for a moment, and observed in a low tone,&#xD;
"Marion, what is the matter ? You seelp to be very ner-,&#xD;
vous and excited, Don't be rash, whatever you do."&#xD;
Marion was in no humor to be pacified, At that moment it&#xD;
appeared to him as though the world had but one object. His&#xD;
marriage with Isabella Granville, his clerkship, his property,&#xD;
all were forgotten. He stepped hastily into. Mr. Granville's&#xD;
private office. The old merchant raised his eyes from the&#xD;
letter he was writing, and without laying down his .pen, asked&#xD;
mildly,;&#xD;
".Any thing particular, Marion ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Granville, it is very particular. I regret that I&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.                     229&#xD;
have not told you before. I will , tell you now, if you will&#xD;
listen to me."&#xD;
The merchant quietly laid down his pen and listened to a&#xD;
narrative which seemed to paralyze him for a moment. Marion&#xD;
informed him of his long attachment-their engagement-of&#xD;
Label's anxiety to conceal it-of her repentance in reference&#xD;
to her promise to marry Benson, and concluded with inform-&#xD;
ing Mr. Granville that he was satisfied that Isabel loved him,&#xD;
and that she would boldly declare it if he would not scare his&#xD;
daughter when he asked her the question. Mr. Granville did&#xD;
not interrupt the narrative except when in the relating of it&#xD;
Marion mentioned the name of Mrs. Tom Granville.  He then&#xD;
simply inquired the extent of her knowledge of' what was&#xD;
passing. It was too late for Marion to equivocate or excuse&#xD;
any one. He told the truth.&#xD;
" Wait for a moment'here," Mr. Granville coldly remarked,&#xD;
and then went to the cashier and received from him a roll of&#xD;
money.   "Now, Mr. Monek, will you go with me ?' politely&#xD;
asked Mr. Granville.&#xD;
" Certainly, sir," answered Marion.&#xD;
There was not another word spoken until both were inside&#xD;
Mr. Granville's house. - The parlor was empty. He rang the&#xD;
bell. The servant answered it.&#xD;
" Tell Miss'Isabel I wish to see.her," said the father.&#xD;
A moment only elapsed ere the fair girl entered the- room.&#xD;
She blushed deeply when she saw who was with her father&#xD;
" Come here, my child. This young gentleman has informed&#xD;
me that he has long been attached to you, and believes that&#xD;
you are attached to him ; is it so ?" kindly asked Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville.&#xD;
She made no reply.&#xD;
"Did you not tell young Mr.~Benson that you loved him,&#xD;
and that you would marry him ?" asked Mr. Granville.&#xD;
I did, Pa," was the.child's reply.&#xD;
"Have you altered your mind, my darling ?"&#xD;
"No, Pa," was the response, plainly spoken.&#xD;
"Do you wish to marry Mr. Marion Monck ?"&#xD;
No, Pa, 'if you do not wish me to do so."&#xD;
" You can go to your room. Seld down your Aunt Kate to&#xD;
me. Now, Mr. Monck, I presume you are satisfied," said&#xD;
Mr. Granville.'&#xD;
" I am, sir.- I have been most grossly deceiyed, and I would&#xD;
not marry her, sir, if she were Queen of England," said the&#xD;
indignant Marion.&#xD;

"I dare say you would not, nor as Miss Isabella Granville.&#xD;
But enough of this."&#xD;
Here entered Mrs. Tom Granville.&#xD;
"Did you send for me, brother Granville?" she asked.&#xD;
I did, madam, and it was to place in your hands this mo.&#xD;
ney," handing her a roll. "I have had evidence of how care-&#xD;
fully you have guarded my daughter, and I wish to relieve&#xD;
you from all farther responsibility, in the matter.  Please use&#xD;
that money to go to Baltimore- this afternoon, or so soon as&#xD;
you see fit. I hope to have my house relieved of your pres-&#xD;
ence before -night," coldly remarked, the exasperated Mr.&#xD;
Granville.&#xD;
"I shall not be here an hour longer, I can assure you,&#xD;
brother of mine"-and, turning to Marion---" I hope some day&#xD;
to thank you for your manliness in revealing secrets to Mr.&#xD;
Granville which, as a gentleman,. you had nor right to reveal.&#xD;
I wish you both farewell."&#xD;
Aunt Kate left the room. Meanwhile Mr. Granville seized&#xD;
a pen and wrote a note, carefully sealing it. It was directed&#xD;
to the cashier of his concern. "Take this, sir," he said, ad-&#xD;
dressing Marion, "and go to the office. The cashier to whom&#xD;
it is addressed will make up your accent and give you a check&#xD;
for what salary is due you. I will remain here until you re-&#xD;
turn. If there is not money in the office, tell him to fill up a&#xD;
check, and I will sign it here. Bring the cartman with you&#xD;
when, you return. I wish you to remove from my house as&#xD;
speedily as possible. It is unnecessary for me to add that I&#xD;
shall have no further need of you in my business; in fact, I&#xD;
wish our acquaintance to end to-night in all ways and shapes,"&#xD;
sternly observed the merchant.&#xD;
"Lcan assure you that in this matter, Mr. Granville, I will&#xD;
be as obedient as I haye ever been to your wishes," was&#xD;
Marion's response.&#xD;
, " Thank you. I regret what has occurred, but it cannot be&#xD;
helped. After what has passed, your own. good sense will&#xD;
point out to you that our acquaintance is at an end," said Mr.&#xD;
Granville.&#xD;
Marion bowed, but did not venture to reply. He carried the&#xD;
note to the office. The cashier made up his account, and&#xD;
drew a check for the balance. The Count had left the office.&#xD;
"Are you going to leave us ?" asked the kind-hearted&#xD;
cashier.O&#xD;
" I believe 30," was the reply. .  .&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.'&#xD;
&#xD;
231&#xD;
&#xD;
"Take the check to Mr. Granville to be signed. Here is&#xD;
your account, on which I have placed my initials."&#xD;
Marion then found the cartman and proceeded to State&#xD;
street. The check was signed by Mr. Granville without a&#xD;
word of comment. Marion went up to his room, packed his&#xD;
things, and one of the servants of Mr. Granville who had gone&#xD;
up with him helped him to.bring his trunks down stairs, and'&#xD;
they were placed upon the cart. "Where shall I g ?" asked&#xD;
the cartman. For a inoment;,-Marion appeared contfi9ed. He&#xD;
did not know where to go. . He thought of Mr. Wilson's old&#xD;
place, and then he told the cartman to drive to Clark &amp;amp; Brown's,&#xD;
in Maiden lane. There he went and there. we will leave him.&#xD;
After Marion's departure, Mr. Granville despatched a note&#xD;
to Col. Benson. That gentleman replied to it by calling in&#xD;
person. The two gentlenien were alone for a long time. Mrs.&#xD;
Kate Granville ha'd been taken with her baggage to the Phila-&#xD;
delphia train before Colonel Bensoir arrived.' She did not bid&#xD;
her brother-in-law good-bye a second' time, but pressed Isa'&#xD;
6.ella to her heart when she left her in-her own room. NV e&#xD;
will not go into any unnecessary details, but will come at once&#xD;
to results. That evening a saall party was assembled at Mr.&#xD;
Granville's residence. Colonel Bensofi, his wife, his daughter,&#xD;
and his son were there. A venerable clergyman was also&#xD;
present, and before he left, Mr. Middleton Benson became the&#xD;
husband of Isabella Granville.&#xD;
The simple girl was, very pale, but she made the responses&#xD;
during the ceremony with a firm voice, and it would have been&#xD;
difficult for a stranger to have noticed that she was dissatised&#xD;
in the least with her share in the proceedings. Mr. Granville&#xD;
appeared satisfied that he was doing a good deed, and provid-&#xD;
ing well for a favorite child. Colonel Benson, also, was not&#xD;
displeased. His son had made what is called a good match.&#xD;
The settlements made by.Mr. Granville were unexceptionable,&#xD;
and of the most liberal character. He was entirely ignorant&#xD;
that Isabella bad any previous. attachment, for Mr. Granville&#xD;
had considered it unnecessary to mention what he- deemed a&#xD;
childish attachment. Middleton acted like a child who had&#xD;
become possessed of a pretty toy that he had admired for a&#xD;
long time.&#xD;
It had been decided by the old people that the new married&#xD;
couple should continue to reside in State street, at the old&#xD;
mansion, and Mr. Granville was to live with them at least for&#xD;
a time. So closed the day, eventful by the fact of the two&#xD;
marriages.&#xD;

the real secret character of Mr. Bennett'&#xD;
MARION removed with bis baggage to the coffee-house in&#xD;
Maiden Lane. It was a lodging house and a restaurant com-&#xD;
bined. It furnished rooms at the moderate sum of two and a&#xD;
half dollars a week, and tlheAoccupant had it optional with him-&#xD;
self where to get his meals. le had to pay for what he or-&#xD;
dered, and if he chose to-live expensively .and consume the&#xD;
choicest bits in the larder, he could do so, or he could live on&#xD;
a more simple fare, or he could; in case of stern necessity,&#xD;
live on bread and water.&#xD;
When the room had been selected, his baggage carried into&#xD;
it, and he felt located, Marion came down into the bar-room,&#xD;
and ordered a glass of hot whiskey punch and a cigar. He,&#xD;
had already learned the way to drown sorrow.  He had not&#xD;
long been seated in the bar-room ere the Count Falsechinski&#xD;
entered.&#xD;
"1Aha, Monsieur Marion. I am seeking for you," was his&#xD;
first address; as he took a chair and seated himself by the side&#xD;
of our hero,&#xD;
"1I am glad to see you, Count, particularly to-night. I sup-&#xD;
pose you have heard that I am no longer one of the white&#xD;
..slaves of Mr. Granville," observed Marion with a-good deal of&#xD;
bitterness.&#xD;
it was the merest accident in the world.  I was at the&#xD;
office towards night, and the cashier told me that you had been&#xD;
paid off, and while he was relating this to, me, the cartman,&#xD;
Billy Christie, entered, and from him I learn that he had&#xD;
carted you and your baggage to this place. What led to the.&#xD;
explosion, and your sudden dismissal, is beyond my present&#xD;
knowledge, and if you will favor me with all the particulars I&#xD;
shall feel very much obliged, and my mind will be very much&#xD;
relieved," replied the Count.&#xD;

&#xD;
Marion cheerfully complied with this reasonable request,&#xD;
and commenced as follows:&#xD;
" Count, I deemed your advice good, and I followed it to&#xD;
the letter.  I determined to know my fate -to know the&#xD;
worst."&#xD;
Then Marion continued, and told the Count all -that our&#xD;
readers have been informed respecting the events of the day.&#xD;
The Count replied,&#xD;
"Nothing but what I expected, my dear boy.  I suppose&#xD;
you are satisfied now that what I told you is true, that you&#xD;
have nothing to hope for in the case of Miss Granville."&#xD;
" I am satisfied that Mr. Granville. is a hard-hearted, un-&#xD;
grateful man, and all my services to hiin go for nothing," said&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
" Of course they do.  He is like all the rest of mankind-.&#xD;
no more nor less. As long as you were of service to him, he&#xD;
was your friend. You cross his purpose, and you are kicked&#xD;
out without a word. Have you any-money ?" asked the ount&#xD;
very kindly.&#xD;
" Plenty ; he paid the balance of my salary, and I have a&#xD;
couple of hundred dollars in my pocket," said Marion.&#xD;
"Two hundred dollars judiciously spent will enable you to&#xD;
carry on the war for some time. I was afraid you had no mo-&#xD;
ney, and came to request that you would make me your bank-&#xD;
er. I am a' rich man, and you need but to ask me for money&#xD;
to obtain it in any quantity. I have had an idea of leaving&#xD;
the employ of Mr. Granville for some time. I shall do so at&#xD;
once. He -has treated you so badly that it will no longer be a&#xD;
pleasure to remain with or be connected with him," remarked&#xD;
the amiable Count.&#xD;
"I thank you, Count, for your generous offer-and I will&#xD;
add,i that.did I need assistance I would at once go to you for&#xD;
it,".replied Marion.&#xD;
"That is right ; and now I wish to give you some advice.&#xD;
Don't take any situation for the present. These changes make&#xD;
a more sensible man. You, I dare say, Marion, think that&#xD;
losing your situation with Mr. Granville will be a great injury&#xD;
to you. No such thing. It will be of service. A young man&#xD;
who is in one position too long gets stereotyped. You had no-&#xD;
thing to expect more from him. You have learned all that is&#xD;
to be learned in that shop.  Now you must try something&#xD;
else. But don't be in a hurry.  I have something in view&#xD;
for you, but my plans are not quite maatured yet. As soon as&#xD;
they are, I shall need your services, and you will find your&#xD;

situation much bettered from what it was yesterday. One&#xD;
thing I must insist upon; don't fall in love again with the&#xD;
next pretty face you meet," said the Count good-humoredly.&#xD;
Here. they were surprised by the entrance of a young clerk&#xD;
of Mr. Gxanville, who had been a warm friend of Marion. His&#xD;
eyes were sparkling with excitement, and he hastily observed,&#xD;
Well, Marion, I have got some news that I thought -you&#xD;
would like to hear, and so I came around to tell you. I have&#xD;
just been to all the morning papers with an advertisement."&#xD;
"What was it about, Benny ?" demanded Marion.&#xD;
"It was a notice of the marriage of Miss ~Bell with Mr.&#xD;
Benson this evening; Mr. Granville sent me with it," replied&#xD;
the boy named Benny.&#xD;
"Oh," exclaimed the Count, I like that.  That is caging&#xD;
the pretty bird with a vengeance.  So, it is all over at last.&#xD;
Marion, my boy, allow me to congratulate you with all my&#xD;
heart. I hope you are cured now, eh'?"&#xD;
Marion did not speak; he was very pale and very angry.&#xD;
He walked across the room rapidly several times, ordered more&#xD;
punch, and thent reseated himself.&#xD;
It is a bitter medicine, Count, but it is all for the best;&#xD;
and as you say, I am satisfied. Thank you, Benny, for the&#xD;
news. Come and see me when you have a spare moment.'.&#xD;
Benny took his leave, and soon after the Count followed his&#xD;
example. When Marion retired to his room that night, it was&#xD;
not to sleep ; his mind, was too .excited for that.  He lay&#xD;
awake thinking over plans for the future ; but before any par-&#xD;
ticular one to suit him had been presented to his mind's eye,&#xD;
lie fell asleep, and it was at a late hour the next morning&#xD;
when he awoke. It all seemed like a dream. le hastily&#xD;
dressed himself, hurried- down to the bar-room, snatched up a,&#xD;
morning paper, and in it found the marriage notice alluded to&#xD;
by the boy Benny.&#xD;
"1No, no," he exclaimed, " it is no dream ; it is all true."&#xD;
He' read no more, but went into the dining room and ordered&#xD;
a cup of coffee and a light breakfast, and when he had finished&#xD;
this slight repast, feeling much better, he smoked a cigar,&#xD;
and took his way up Nassau street. Once or twice he turned&#xD;
about with his face towards the store.  How odd it is to&#xD;
change our habits, and refrain from frequenting old haunts&#xD;
For years Marion's footsteps had taken him in the direction of&#xD;
Mr. Granville'A counting room. Suddenly he found himself&#xD;
cut off from going there- any more. He could hardly realize it,&#xD;
and he felt an isolation that can only be understood by those&#xD;

who have experienced it.  He wended 'his way Up to the&#xD;
Clinton Hall, in which building was the Mercantile Library&#xD;
Association. He had never omitted to pay his dues at that&#xD;
knowledge-fountain for young clerks, and had never discon-&#xD;
nected himself from it, although for a long - time he had not&#xD;
availed himself fully of its privileges. This morning he saun.&#xD;
tered in, was accosted cheerfully by the librarian, and for an&#xD;
hour or more he amused himself by reading one 'of the Euro-&#xD;
pean publications found upon its tables.. Tired of this, Marion&#xD;
again sought the street, and passed out of the Hall'by the Nas-&#xD;
sau street entrance. He halted for a moment on the step, and&#xD;
was accosted by a person who was passing, -with a "' Good&#xD;
morning, sir."&#xD;
" Good morning," replied Marion, but at that instant he&#xD;
recognized the speaker, and added, "Ah, Mr. Bennett, I did&#xD;
not at first recognize you; how do you do, sir ?"&#xD;
"Very well; and what are you doing up near little Wall&#xD;
street? I thought your researches did not extend above the&#xD;
lower Wall street," said Mr. Bennett, laughing, for he had&#xD;
already nicknamed Ann street, in which the Herald office was&#xD;
located, as ' Little Wall street.'&#xD;
"I cannot say that. I am connected with' Wall street or&#xD;
Broad street any more ; I am out of mercantile business, "-said&#xD;
'Marion.&#xD;
Indeed! How long since ?" asked Mr. Bennett,&#xD;
"Twenty-four hours," replied Marion.&#xD;
Mr. Bennett added, " Then your time cannot be much occu-&#xD;
pied, and you wifl have leisure to go over the way to my&#xD;
room. Come along with me."&#xD;
Marion did as Mr. Bennett desired, and went over to the&#xD;
editor's room. At that time, directly'opposite Clinton Hall in&#xD;
Nassau street, there stood five brick three-story buildings,&#xD;
about twenty feet wide each. ' The lower floors were occupied&#xD;
as stores and the upper part as boarding houses.  It waq in&#xD;
.the third' building from the corner of Beekman that Mr. Ben-&#xD;
nett had his quarters. 'Marion followed his conductor up the&#xD;
narrow stairs to the third floor, and into the front room over-&#xD;
looking Vassau street.&#xD;
".This is my sanctum," said tie editor, "and now take a&#xD;
seat and make yourself at home. I have a line to write and&#xD;
then I will talk-to you."&#xD;
Marion glanced his eyes about the sleeping apartment of the&#xD;
man who was even then making himself felt in journalism.&#xD;

and between the windows was a table with but Very few papers&#xD;
upon it ; for it is a very extraordinary fact that ,this remarka-&#xD;
ble editor, even in after years, when an accumulation of letters&#xD;
and masses of manuscript read and received would have been&#xD;
on his hands, never appeared to have many papers about him;&#xD;
all were disposed of summarily and systematically, and' but&#xD;
few papers covered his table. There were oue or two books&#xD;
recently published, sent in to be noticed. Oa one corner of&#xD;
thp table was a small pocket edition of Shakespeare, with leaves&#xD;
innumerable turned down as an index, and many little slips of&#xD;
paper markers between the leaves. The imprint was "Glasgow:&#xD;
1814." ' The editor had now finished what he was writing, and&#xD;
noticipg that Marion had examined the little volume, he&#xD;
observed, "That volume is a great favorite of mine. I value&#xD;
it not only. as 'Shakespeare,' but as in old familiar friend. I&#xD;
brought it with me from Scotland. It was my only coiipanion&#xD;
from Charleston here, and in many of my wanderings it has&#xD;
been the only book I owned, as it is now'the only book I own.&#xD;
I would not part with it for its weight in gold.-You told me&#xD;
you had left commerce. flow is that ?"&#xD;
Marion then informed him of what had passed to the extent&#xD;
that-he had parted from Mr. Granville.0&#xD;
"And what dd you intend to do now ?-" asked the editor.&#xD;
"I don't exactly know. I presume I shall find, some open-&#xD;
ing for me. I have served an apprenticeship of over seven&#xD;
years, and it would seem like folly to throw all the information&#xD;
I have acquired in that time away, and seek some other em-&#xD;
ployment," said Marion.&#xD;
" How would you like to connect yourself with newspaper&#xD;
life ? I think you would succeed very well," observed the&#xD;
editor.&#xD;
"Me! I never wrote a line in my life to be, printed," was&#xD;
Marion's reply.&#xD;
" It don't follow that you could not do it. On the contrary,&#xD;
I think you would write well with a little practice. Do you&#xD;
remember that boarding-house story you told at the dinner the&#xD;
day you became of age ? That was very amusing. If I had it&#xD;
-now I would publish it. If you could writc that, precisely as&#xD;
you told it,'it would make a capital article," said theditor.&#xD;
" You flatter me, Mr. Bennett; but-v I. am afraid I should&#xD;
make a poor band at a newspaper article. I must stick to&#xD;
business, and I suppose I shall find something to do ere long,"&#xD;
answered Marion.&#xD;
" If you do not, come and' see me," Mr. Bennett replied.&#xD;

"I am rarely mistaken in my estimate of a person's ability,&#xD;
and I will give you a trial whenever you are so disposed. So&#xD;
Miss Granville is married ?"&#xD;
"1Yes sir. She was married last night. You must 'have&#xD;
noticed it in the morning papers ?" said Marion.&#xD;
"I did. What passes among my friends, .or my enemies,&#xD;
for that matter, rarely escapes my attention. I generally. get&#xD;
hold of it early. And my white-cravated friend Wilson has&#xD;
also married ? Why, marriage seems to be the order of the&#xD;
day in your quarter of the city. Bye-and-bye I suppose you&#xD;
will be following the example of some of these people.. What&#xD;
has become of the Count Falsechinski?  He is a very curious&#xD;
fellow, that," said the editor.&#xD;
Marion made a reply, not noticing the marriage allusion. It&#xD;
was a sore subject to him ; and. soon after he remarked that&#xD;
he knew the value of an editor's time, and would not trespass&#xD;
longer upon it, and he took his leave. Before doing so, the&#xD;
editor gave him a cordial invitation -to call upon him at any&#xD;
time he found convenient, that he should always be happy to&#xD;
see him. This was an invitation that Mr. Bennett gave to very&#xD;
few people of the tens of thousands that he came in contact&#xD;
with then and in after years.&#xD;
That scene in a Nassau street boarding-house occurred a&#xD;
quarter of a century ago. That editor was as conscious of&#xD;
power at that time as he isg now. He cared nothing for money&#xD;
then, save to serve the great purpose of his life, the establish-&#xD;
ment of a great independent daily journal, modelled after his&#xD;
own ideas of what a daily journal should be.' He worked then&#xD;
with brain and hands-nientally and physically, to achieve suc-&#xD;
cess, and he succeeded. He had commenced with a partner,&#xD;
a stupid jackass, in Ann street. After the fire, which had&#xD;
burned out his establishment, Mr. Bennett started'again, alone,&#xD;
with a solemn determination that for his natural life he would&#xD;
have no more' to do with partners. He planted upon the* ie-&#xD;
raId 'its imprint, " James Gordon Bennett, Editor and Propri-&#xD;
etor," and it has never been changed to this day. His old&#xD;
partner started an opposition paper, another Herald, but that&#xD;
soon died out, and Mr. Bennett was in the field alone. He&#xD;
was not inexperienced in journalism in the city of New York,&#xD;
for as early as 1827 he started in Chatham  Square a small&#xD;
daily, which he sold for one cent. It did not last long. Later&#xD;
he started a Sunday paper. He was for a long time connected&#xD;
with a paper that the celebrated Henry Eckford owned, called&#xD;
the National Advocate. His connection with Webb and Noah&#xD;

is well known. lie made these men famous, and when he left&#xD;
the Courier and Enquirer, it was to connect himself with a&#xD;
daily journal in Philadelphia. From thence he came to New&#xD;
York, and soon after the Herald sprang into existence. Mr.&#xD;
Bennett was then what he has been in more mature age, quiet,&#xD;
reserved and thoughtful. Words may escape his memory, but-&#xD;
never an, idea, or a new idea. Few men can distinguish so&#xD;
readily the difference between mere words, however prettily&#xD;
expressed, and words that convey ideas. He has ever used a&#xD;
small memorandum book. In it lie writes a catch word to a&#xD;
thought or an idea. This book is the key to the editorials in&#xD;
his paper of that or the ensuing day, or used to recall an idea,&#xD;
a fact, or the beading for an article weeks or months after it'&#xD;
was noted, and eventually 'became the subject matter for a&#xD;
" leader," or a series ot editorials of a thundering or. startling&#xD;
character.&#xD;
He is both shy and extremely sensitive. He admits'few to&#xD;
any degree of intimacy with him. Those that he so selects&#xD;
must be original men, who are able to suggest new ideas, or&#xD;
strike out ne w and startling subjects-men who have travelled,&#xD;
and who can give him information upon subjects that lie did&#xD;
not know before. All is fish that comes to his net. He values&#xD;
men as they contribute to the success of his journal.- Person-&#xD;
ally he is as cold as an icicle. . With a man of information, he&#xD;
will talk out an editorial in' the very presence of the man who&#xD;
has originated the ideas or facts upon which it is based. He&#xD;
will enlarge upon the emanations of the minds of others so&#xD;
that when they read the very editorial a few days afterwards,&#xD;
and recognize its groundwork or base, they will be perfectly&#xD;
astounded at the beauty and symmetry' of its appearance, its&#xD;
ornaments, and the genius of the entire editorial structure. If&#xD;
a statesman calls upon him, and he possesses genius, original-&#xD;
ity, or information of any kind, past, present or future, that ,is&#xD;
unknown to Mr. Bennett, the eyes of the latter sparkle-he&#xD;
moves uneasily in his chair, or rouses himself up if reclining&#xD;
on a sofa, and leads off in conversation until he draws his man&#xD;
out, and has drained him dry. -Then perhaps he will talk on&#xD;
for his own practice, or to impress the subject more fully upon&#xD;
his own memory, or to shape it for an editorial. Some editors&#xD;
write out their thoughts--Mr. Bennett thinks them out, in his&#xD;
solitary hours, and is as ready to dictate a complete editorial&#xD;
from his tongue, as others were to write one. Some days. a&#xD;
gentleman will see in the next day's Herald an analysis of his&#xD;
own 'conversation with the editor the evening previous. What&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
*23&#xD;
&#xD;
he acquires from anybody goes into the editorial mind and&#xD;
mill, and the editorial miller grinds it and adopts it as his own,&#xD;
and forgets where it came from; and so completely does it be-&#xD;
come a part of himself, that he will use the identical idea or&#xD;
fact to the very man who gave it to him, unless perhaps he has&#xD;
previously used it in the Herald editorials.&#xD;
Many mdn, or rather the vast majority of mankind who read&#xD;
the Herald, have no real idea of the character, mind or habits&#xD;
of the editor and proprietor. They regard him as a lucky in-&#xD;
dividual, who as an editor has prospered in life in a financial&#xD;
point of view, and is enabled to cluster around him men of&#xD;
talent, and that these writers make the great newspaper that&#xD;
the Herald unquestionably is. This is true but to a very lim.&#xD;
ited extent. Those men carry out ideas that originate with the&#xD;
proprietor. His mind is unceasing in'its activity. -It is never&#xD;
idle. He comes to his office charged with matter for his edi-&#xD;
torials. He calls in one reporter to his private sanctum. Die-&#xD;
tating a column perhaps upon one subject,. the reporter takes&#xD;
it down in shor-t hand in five or ten minutes, and goes out to&#xD;
his desk to write. it out. Another reporter -succeeds him. Mr.&#xD;
Bennett is perhaps ten minutes more in dictating another col-&#xD;
umn, upon another su ject. So it goes on for an hour, until&#xD;
editorial articles of the highest importance are dictated. The&#xD;
reportters. write out these articles.. They are sent up to the&#xD;
printing office, and all the force is put on them. Mr. Bennett,&#xD;
if he chooses, can read the corrected proof, and yet not be de-&#xD;
tained more than an hour at the office from the time he arrived.&#xD;
Such are the inner workings of the Herald office.&#xD;
Money, this singular man regards as dross, except so far as&#xD;
it contributes to the increase of his paper. Show Mr. Bennett.&#xD;
a mode by which he could make a million certain in a specula-,&#xD;
tion, and he. would laugh at the proposal, but decline to have&#xD;
anything to do with the affair.' 1 This can be said of him- with&#xD;
truth, that he. never speculated to the extent of a dollar in his&#xD;
life, and never prostituted or used the' columns of his paper&#xD;
to forward the speculationsor private objects of others know-&#xD;
iigly. Show him a working plan of type and press that would&#xD;
-strike off a million of copies an hour, and he would buy it, if&#xD;
it cost a million, and would not give a penny more for it, were&#xD;
he guaranteed the exclusive use of it. He wants the best of&#xD;
everything that increases the power of the Herald, but he&#xD;
cares not a fig if the rival papers have the same facilities.' He&#xD;
wants the machinery of the Herald equal to any other paper.&#xD;
aHe don't want any to exceed him, but he cares not how near&#xD;

they approach him, if they have the genius and means to do so.&#xD;
The Herald is himself-he knows no other joy or pleasure&#xD;
compared with it.  It is his god-,-his idol-his all ; and every&#xD;
thing else falls below it in his mind. His is a terrible power,&#xD;
and he knows it. He is conscious that every line tells upon&#xD;
thousands of the human race.&#xD;
He has the giant's power, but does not use it like a giant.&#xD;
If Mr. Bennett had malice, he could dictate an editorial that&#xD;
wbuld set New York by the ears, and have mobs and riots&#xD;
every week of his life. But no-that he does not regard as&#xD;
the proper vocation of a great newspaper conductor.&#xD;
We are somewhat i advance of our story, but the author&#xD;
has written of a man who 'twenty-five years ago was what he is,&#xD;
now, save success--which be had 'not then reached. People&#xD;
have an idea that the Herald twenty-five years ago was a hor-&#xD;
rible paper. It was not so, and would not appear so if the old&#xD;
files were re-published to-day. When Mr. Bennett started&#xD;
the Herald he published'-every thing that occurred or that was&#xD;
talked about in the street. At that time it was an innovation.&#xD;
upon the old established newspaper custom, and the Herald&#xD;
was regarded as an immoral publication. Now the same things&#xD;
are published daily, only a hundred times worse, by every&#xD;
daily paper, but nothing is thought of it.&#xD;

son at their breakfast the morning after their own marriage,&#xD;
when they read in the morning papers of another marriage,&#xD;
that of young Benson with Isabella Granville, can be better&#xD;
imagined than-described.&#xD;
" Impossible I  What can it mean, Richard !' exclaimed&#xD;
Mrs. Wilson.&#xD;
*Each offered half a dozen supposable cases, but none were&#xD;
satisfactory. At last Mr. Wilson remarked, " It is beyond my&#xD;
ability to solve the riddle. I know of but one way to ascertain&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.            '241&#xD;
&#xD;
the facts, and, my dear, as you appear to be so anxious about&#xD;
the matter, I will go at once and find out all about it. When&#xD;
I come home to dinner you shall know all."&#xD;
With this understanding Mr. Wilson left home, and pro-&#xD;
ceeded down town. At the head of Wall street, opposite&#xD;
Trinity Church, he met the Count Falsechinski. The Count&#xD;
immediately told Mr. Wilson all he knew about the matter.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson asked, "Do you mean to say that Marion Monek&#xD;
has been discharged from our employ by Mr. Granville '"&#xD;
"In the most peremptory manner. Paid off, too. I met&#xD;
him at his new lodging place, for he left the house of Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville last night, bag and baggage, and took up his quarters at&#xD;
your old place in Maiden Lane. I think he has the identical&#xD;
room that you occupied when you boarded in that house," re-&#xD;
marked the Count.&#xD;
"I must see about this. It is rather a high-handed proceed-&#xD;
ing, I think, on the part of Mr. Granville, to discharge that&#xD;
young man and not say a word to 'ne. I thank you, Count, for&#xD;
your information. We shall meet soon at the office. In the&#xD;
meantime, good-bye," said Mr. Wilson, and passed onward to&#xD;
the counting-room.&#xD;
Mr. Granville had just arrived. When Mr. Wilson entered&#xD;
the office, he walked up to his partner and congratulated him&#xD;
upon the marriage of his daughter, adding, "It seems to have&#xD;
happened in a hurry, or I presume~ you would have informed&#xD;
me that so important an event was to take place in your&#xD;
family."&#xD;
Mr. Granville replied, "Yes, Wilson, it was a marriage got&#xD;
up somewhat hastily, but I had my reasons. WAlk in the  ri-&#xD;
vate office, and I will tell you all about it."&#xD;
Both partners remained close ted together for some time, and&#xD;
when Mr. Wilson re-appeared, he seemed worried, and not at&#xD;
all satisfied. le took his hat, and left the -office for Maiden&#xD;
Lane. At the coffee-house of Clark &amp;amp; Brown he found Marion,&#xD;
who had just returned frot his visit to Mr. Bennett. Ile put&#xD;
out his hand in the, most cordial manner, and 'observed, "I&#xD;
hope, Marion, you do not think that I have had any hand in&#xD;
your abrupt dismissal from our employment."&#xD;
"No indeed, sir," replied Marion. " I know to whom I am&#xD;
indebted, and it could not well have happened' otherwise. I&#xD;
blame no one. Not even Mr. Granville. He has acted in the&#xD;
matter as he deemed would niost conduce to his own happiness&#xD;
and I have not a word to say. I trust it will prove for the&#xD;

"I am rejoiced to find you take it .so coolly, and like a&#xD;
philosopher. But what are you going to do now? You -must&#xD;
not remain idle," said Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
"I have not settled upon any definite plan. I shall be&#xD;
forced to remainidle for a short time at least, although I hope&#xD;
it will not be lng, for mine is not a disposition to keep quiet.&#xD;
I must find some thing to do, or I shall die," replied Marion.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson4 rejoined, "Come with me this afternoon to din-&#xD;
ner. I will take no excuse. Mrs. Nordheim.r-l mean my.&#xD;
wife-will be pleased to see you. I will not take 'No' for an&#xD;
answer. Go you inust."&#xD;
Thus invited, Marion, accompanied by Mr. Wilson, walked&#xD;
up town to the residence of that gentleman. Mrs. Wilson&#xD;
welcomed Marion cordially. Dinner was not quite - ready, and&#xD;
Mr. Wilson unfolded his budget of news. He informed his&#xD;
wife of all the reasons that Mr. Granville had, given for his&#xD;
urging on the marriage of his daughter, and for discharging&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
" Well, Marion, you must not let it break down your spirits.&#xD;
There is no remedy for you that I see. Isabella has married,&#xD;
Mr. Granville has discharged you from his employ, and now we&#xD;
must put our heads together and see if-we cannot do some thing&#xD;
to remedy your loss of a situation. What do you say, Mr.&#xD;
Wilson ?" asked his wife, as she made these practical observa-&#xD;
tions to the 'discharged clerk.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson replied that undoubtedly a better situation even&#xD;
could be obtained for Marion, but that it would take time, that&#xD;
he would use his utmost exertions to get him as good a situa-&#xD;
tion as he had lost.&#xD;
Here the servant came in to say that dinner was served, and&#xD;
the parties went to the table. Dinner occupied a long hour,&#xD;
and Mrs. Wilson did all in her power to cheer up Marion's&#xD;
spirits. She so far succeeded that when Marion left the house,&#xD;
towards evening, he promised to return again soon, and walked&#xD;
to his lodgings with a higher ambition to succeed in New York&#xD;
than he had felt for a long time,&#xD;
"This trouble is 'only a trial of my strength of .mind, per-&#xD;
haps, and now I can show that I am as capable of bearing ad-&#xD;
versity as 'prosperity," was his thought, and when he reached&#xD;
his lodgings he had reasoned himself into the belief that his&#xD;
discharge and the marriage of Isabella were two things that&#xD;
had occurred for his particular benefit, instead of to his'injury.&#xD;
Marion continued to look about him for a situation for some&#xD;
weeks, but without any success. He was aided by Mr. Wilson,&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
-243&#xD;
&#xD;
and also by the Count Falsechinski, but the efforts of the three&#xD;
amounted to nothing. Marion seemed destined to remain idle.&#xD;
For the first time in his life, he indulged freely in all the&#xD;
pleasures to be derived from visiting places of amusement in&#xD;
New York. The place in which he lodged was frequently'&#xD;
visited by English actors and their friends, who could there&#xD;
order an English beefsteak. One of those visitors, whose&#xD;
name was Adam Close, although an American, was an intimate&#xD;
friend.of Brough, the English singer, who was then engaged at&#xD;
the Park Theatre in connection with the Woods, singing in the&#xD;
operas of "La Sonambula" and " Amelia."  Mr. Close wa.s&#xD;
also a friend, of Mr. Simpson and Mr. Barry, and he introduced&#xD;
Marion into the interior of the old Park Theatre. In the green&#xD;
room he made many acquaintances. Mrs. Vernon was then in&#xD;
her prime. John Kemble Mason, who afterwards married the&#xD;
daughter of worthy old Cram, the distiller, was one.of the stock&#xD;
actors,.and an intimacy-sprang up between him and Marion&#xD;
which continued many years afterward.' Not a night passed&#xD;
that Marion did not attend the Theatre; both before and behind&#xD;
the curtain, and hardly a ni~giht passed that he did not invite&#xD;
some of his new species of acquaintances to a supper with him,&#xD;
either at "Windust's " cellar, near the Theatre, or at Salum&#xD;
&amp;amp;.Suscombe's famous restaurant; which many of our readers&#xD;
will well remember,&#xD;
Not alone did he limit his patronage to the Park . Theatre.&#xD;
The Bowery was just then in its glory, under the regime of&#xD;
the renowned Hamblim. Miss Waring was the star of that&#xD;
establishment, and the gorgeous plays enacted at that popular&#xD;
haunt were a source of great attraction. Marion became well&#xD;
acquainted with all the popular actors and actresses on those.&#xD;
boards, and even with the immortal Hamblin himself.&#xD;
. The Franklin Theatre in Chatham square was then in full&#xD;
blast, with William.Seften as the Golden Farmer and John&#xD;
Seften as Jemmy Twitcher. The' Olympic, with Mitchell as&#xD;
manager, had just commenced its career of success. ,A very&#xD;
few months of idleness made Marion well posted in the theat-&#xD;
rical business of the town. He had acquired, in addition, an-&#xD;
other habit, that seemed to grow with what it fed on. Marion&#xD;
had always been abstemious in his habits so far as drinking&#xD;
'spiritous liquors or wines was concerned. A few glasses of&#xD;
wine at most, would, at an earlier period, have completely&#xD;
upset his equilibrium, bat after a few months had -been spent&#xD;
iin giving suppers and drinking parties, a fe w bottles would&#xD;
hardly disturb his nerves ; and a habit of drinking was grow-&#xD;

"Come, Marion, rouse up. I have work for you to do. A&#xD;
new chapter in life for you to open.".&#xD;

WE must now return to the Count Falsechinski and his suc-&#xD;
cess in real estate speculatiors. The Count had fairly gained&#xD;
the entire"confidence of the old Wall street broker, Nat Prime.&#xD;
He called upon him frequently, and was always well received.&#xD;
Some time previous to the result of the real estate operationbeing&#xD;
known the Count asked to see Mr. Prime'alone. The former had&#xD;
in his hands a bundle of papers and letters. When he was&#xD;
-closeted with old Nat, and when they' were- not likely to be&#xD;
interrupted, the Count asked, "Mr. Prime, do you believe&#xD;
that I am a Count ?"&#xD;
Mr. Prime gave a sort of laugh, and answered the question&#xD;
by saving, "I never troubled my head much about the mat-&#xD;
ter, Count, for I did not care whether you were or not.    It&#xD;
made no difference to me."&#xD;
"For that reason, my dear sir, and because you have not&#xD;
seemed to care, but have treated me in the most cordial man.&#xD;
ner 1as a man, without knowing any thing of my antecedents, I&#xD;
feel happy to be able to show you authentic documents prov-&#xD;
ing who and what I am. I could not do- so until this morning,&#xD;
when the maiL brought me a letter from      Mr. Bodisco, the&#xD;
Russian Minister at Washington. Will you read this letter '"'&#xD;
asked the Count, as he passed a letter to the old man,&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Prime received it into his hands, looked it over a&#xD;
moment, and observed, "Vount, this is all, Greek to me. I&#xD;
cau't read Russian, Polish, or whatever language this letter is&#xD;
written in. You must translate it for me."&#xD;
"I forgot, Mr. Prime. The ltter from Mr. Bodisco is&#xD;
written in the French language. I will translate it for you."&#xD;
"Do so, and it will answer all necessary purposes," was the&#xD;
reply of Mr. Prime.&#xD;
The Count continued: "Before I do.this, Mr. Prime, I must&#xD;
mention some facts connected with my family interest. I am a&#xD;
younger brother of one of the oldest families in poor Poland.&#xD;
My brother Stanislaus- took an active part in a rising against&#xD;
Russia some years ago. He was seized. and exiled.to Siberia.&#xD;
I was a mere lad at the time, and perhaps might have shared&#xD;
his fate, bad not a friend of my father at some risk to himself&#xD;
protected and educated me. I was forgotten until [ had grown&#xD;
to be a young man, when accident revealed to, the authorities&#xD;
at Warsaw who I really was. I barely escaped with my life,&#xD;
and reached England safely. I soon after came to this country,&#xD;
and then I swore a solemn oath that I would~not eat, drink, or&#xD;
do any thing that involved expense, except to barely keep life&#xD;
in my body until I acquired sufficient funds to pay whatever&#xD;
fines the Russian government might inflict upon me, in order&#xD;
that I might then be restored to my position in society, and be&#xD;
enabled to return to my own county without danger to my life&#xD;
or to my liberty. -My brother had no children; but as there&#xD;
was no pardon for him, no hope of clemency from the emperor&#xD;
in his behalf, it perhaps was lucky for me that his death, which&#xD;
became known at St. Petersburg about eighteen months ago,&#xD;
placed me at. the head of my family, and enabled me to treat&#xD;
for restoration to my own rights. A powerful friend of mine&#xD;
in the Ruissian capital went to work faithfully for my interest.&#xD;
Letters, upon letters have passed. I have given the most&#xD;
solemun assurance to the Russian government of my devotion.&#xD;
The result of all this is that I am fully restored to My true&#xD;
rank, or the rank that my brother held before his unfortunate&#xD;
patriotic failure, and without any conditions except the pay-&#xD;
ment of a fine which amounts to about twenty-two thousand&#xD;
dollars ot your money, which has been imposed upon me. The&#xD;
matter is now in the hands of the Russian Minister at Wash-&#xD;
ington. I have to arrange the financial part with him, and he&#xD;
wiJi send the same to the European Government. In less t'ban&#xD;
a year all obstacles will be removed. .I shall be' once more&#xD;
upon a good footing with the Government-the head of mg wn&#xD;

the Falsechinski's  This is the purport of the Ambassador's&#xD;
letter, dated at Washington."&#xD;
"What is the income of the estates of your family, Count?"&#xD;
asked the banker.&#xD;
The Count replied, "Before they were confiscated and my&#xD;
brother exiled, the revenue was almost princely-I believe as&#xD;
high as twenty-five thousand pounds sterling. But I have no&#xD;
idea that they can now be anything like that amount, even under&#xD;
the most favorable circumstances. Be these revenues small&#xD;
or great, is not the question. I want to be a man once more,&#xD;
in the land of my birth, instead of a wanderer ; I wish to hold&#xD;
my true fank and position, even if the revenue were not one&#xD;
cent," said the Count.&#xD;
"Right, perfectly right, Count; you are a man, every inch&#xD;
of you, and I am glad you have told me this. What can I do&#xD;
to aid you ?" asked Mr-. Prime.&#xD;
" You can draw a check to the order of M. Bodisco, and I&#xD;
will remlit it to him. This check will be returned to you&#xD;
after it has beew paid at the bank, will it not "T' asked the&#xD;
Count.&#xD;
" Aha! my Count. I see what you ar'e driving at. It will&#xD;
be evidence that you have paid the money, in case the Russian&#xD;
Minister proves tricky, eh ?" said Mr. Prime.&#xD;
"He may not acknowledge receipt of the money, and as you&#xD;
say, Mr. Prime, the check with his endorsement would be&#xD;
pretty conclusive evidence that he had got it, but I hope there&#xD;
will never be any necessity to use it against him," was the&#xD;
remark of the Count.&#xD;
"'There is nothing like being on- the, safe side with those&#xD;
diplomatic chaps. They are an uncertain set. More so than&#xD;
common counts and humbugs. Excuse me, Count; I did not&#xD;
mean you. But to tell you the truth, Count, I have always&#xD;
regarded you as a sharp, shrewd, intelligent -man.  I always&#xD;
liked you, but until this morning I fancied that so far as your.&#xD;
Countship was concerned, that it was all humbug.  But I did&#xD;
not like you the worse for it, and I can't say that I shall like&#xD;
you any better for knowing that you are a real, instead of a&#xD;
shan Count," said Mr. Prime.&#xD;
The Count bowed, but did not make a reply. He knew that&#xD;
he had raised himself full one hundred per cent. in the banker's&#xD;
estimation by what he had stated, for the old gentleman was a&#xD;
real admirer of aristocracy, let it belong to what country it&#xD;
might. The Count had not done yet.&#xD;

"Mr. Prime," he asked, "how does my account stand with&#xD;
you sipce the sale of the real estate ?"&#xD;
The banker made no reply, but rose and walked to the door.&#xD;
He opened it and called "Mr. Christmas," and then reseated&#xD;
himself. A moment elapsed, and the employee answering to&#xD;
the name of Christmas made his appearance.&#xD;
"What balance has the Count in. our hands in cash, and&#xD;
what securities also ?" asked the banker.&#xD;
"Shall I make out his account with the interest added to&#xD;
his credit ?"-asked the bookkeeper.&#xD;
"No, no. Simply the balance, without interest. That can&#xD;
be made-up at any time, and, by the way, draw a check for&#xD;
twenty-two thousand dollars to the order of Mr. Bodisco, the&#xD;
Russian Minister at Washington," ordered the banker.&#xD;
"Make it twenty-five thousand dollars," remarked the Count,&#xD;
and turning to Mr. Prime, he added, "It is better to make it&#xD;
somewhat larger than the exact amount. It will do no harm.&#xD;
Although a minister cannot be. bribed, yet it don't do any&#xD;
harm to have two'or three thousand dollars in his hands. He&#xD;
may have expenses to incur, eh, Mr. Prime ?" quietly observed&#xD;
the Count.&#xD;
Both laughed heartily, and the expression of their faces&#xD;
would seem to imply that they had no idea that the Russian&#xD;
Minister would ever return any change on thWe twenty-five&#xD;
thousand dollar check. Presently ,the bookkeeper returned&#xD;
and stated, "The Count has a cash balance to his credit on our&#xD;
books of one hundred and six thousand dollars; less this check&#xD;
of twenty-five thousand dollars, it is eighty-one thousand dol-&#xD;
lars. We also hold bond a mortgage for one hundred and&#xD;
fifty thousand dollars, bearing interest at seven per cent., pay-&#xD;
able semi-annually."&#xD;
"Thank you. That is all, Mr. Christmas," said Mr. Prime,&#xD;
and the bookkeeper returned, and the old banker turned to the&#xD;
Count. "Pretty snug, that, Count. Eighty-one thousand at&#xD;
four per cent. is three thousand two hundred and forty dollars,&#xD;
and seven per cent. on one hundred and fifty thousand dollars;&#xD;
is ten thousand five hundred dollars. Total, thirteen thousand&#xD;
seven hundred and forty dollars. Nearly. fourteen thousand&#xD;
per annum, Count, is a nice little income for any single man,&#xD;
and can be increased still more. Count, when you go back to&#xD;
Europe, I suppose you will be marrying some of those blooded&#xD;
-dames, eh ?"&#xD;
. r " Really, Mr. Prime, I cannot say ; but you will laugh it&#xD;
meif I confide a little secret to you," replied the Count.&#xD;

"Not a bit-.-not a bit of it. Tell me your secret. Some&#xD;

old banker ruLbed his hands with delight.&#xD;
The Count saw his advantage at once, and he had a. plan&#xD;
fully matured in his own mind. He needed the assistance of&#xD;
Mr. Prinie to carry it out to a successful conclusion.&#xD;
"Ah, Mr. Prime, you have guessed my secret. I am in love&#xD;
with a beautiful young lady, but I have no hopes. She is not&#xD;
within my reach," said the-Count, in a very humble tone.&#xD;
"Not within your reach ? How the d--l is that?    You&#xD;
have a capital of nearly two liundred and fifty thousand dol-&#xD;
lars, that I know. You are a Count. You are very good look-&#xD;
ing. You are intelligent, and how is she not within youi,&#xD;
reach ? Perhaps the lady is already married," said the banker.&#xD;
"Oh, no, sir. She is single, and her father is a particular&#xD;
friend of -yours,") replied the Count.&#xD;
"Indeed. Who is she?    Tell ne her father's name.' Per-&#xD;
haps I can give you a helping hand in the matter, eh?  Do&#xD;
you know ber well?  How long have you been acquainted with&#xD;
her ?" hurriedly asked the banker, who was 'now fully inter-&#xD;
ested in the affair.&#xD;
este am not even acquainted with the lady to speak to her. I&#xD;
have met her on one occasion, btit she was so far above me&#xD;
that I did not dream of ever being able to aspire to -her hand.&#xD;
With your aid, Mr. Prime, the case is different. Her name is&#xD;
Irene Grasper, and she is the daughter of your friend Mr,&#xD;
Grasper. There, the secret is out, and I Iope safe in your&#xD;
keeping," said the Count.&#xD;
" Safe, my dear boy, as a rat in a trap. Above you, man&#xD;
alive! No such thing. She shall be yours. I will make it&#xD;
my business to see her father. You are'no humbug. You&#xD;
have got the tin, the solid rocks, and he must pint, too, if you&#xD;
marry his daughter," said the banker.&#xD;
"'My dear sir, I do not mean to marry for money. Never&#xD;
dreamed of such a thing," and the Count could hardly kepp&#xD;
his countenance, for it was the- money that the -Count had in&#xD;
view. Hehad-a list of all the young ladies of property in&#xD;
New York. He had corrected and altered it for three years&#xD;
according to circumstances. He' had made up his: mind t,&#xD;
marry a fortune, and to go through with the entire list, /one by&#xD;
dne, until he married the richest that he could get out of the,&#xD;

was a fool if he did not.&#xD;
,1'll tell you what it is, Count-that is all very fine on&#xD;
your part, but you have consulted me in this matter, and I am&#xD;
your banker. I will not permit you to be imposed on. You&#xD;
have, as I said before, a title and the hard stuff. If you  marry&#xD;
my old friend's daughter, he shall come down handsomely. He&#xD;
shil put up the solid. I think he ought to give his daughter&#xD;
as much as yoi can show.  Leave that all to ine.  D you&#xD;
secure the girl, I will arrange the matter with my old crony.&#xD;
You have got nearly two hundred and fifty thousand dollars&#xD;
that I can vouch for, Count. Suppose old John don't or won't&#xD;
agree to plank down for his daughter that sum. What shall I&#xD;
do then ?" asked Mr. Prime.&#xD;
"Excuse me, Mr. Prime, but the idea of mixing up. money&#xD;
matters in. an affair of the heart really shocks me, but if you&#xD;
insist upon my saying some thing, I will only say I leave it&#xD;
entirely in your hands. I think if he gives any thng to his&#xD;
daughter, he ought to secure her one hundred and fifty thou-&#xD;
sand dollars in your hands the moment she is married to me.&#xD;
You arrange it for her secretly. I don't want the money---&#xD;
don't need it," said the Count.&#xD;
"Say no more, Count He shall do it. You are as liberal&#xD;
as a prince, and I will see that you are not imposed upon, and&#xD;
now I am going to bid you good-morning, Count, come down&#xD;
to No. I Broadway to-morrow and dine with me. I don't say,&#xD;
but Ithink you will find some body there that you will - be&#xD;
pleased to see," said the banker.&#xD;
The Count Falsechinski took his hat, and left the banker's&#xD;
office, after having politely accepted the invitation to dine.&#xD;
When he was clear of the premises, he walked down .to Del.&#xD;
monico's and ordered a cup of coffee and a cigar, 'and while&#xD;
sipping the one and puffing-the other, his reflections were of a&#xD;
very pleasant character. Occasionally, he rubbed his hands&#xD;
and shrugged his shoulders as he counted up the sucess of-his&#xD;
plans. "The remittance to tie Minister will place my affair&#xD;
right in Russia. So much for that business. I will make love&#xD;
to Miss Grasper. Her papa, under Mr. Prime's tuition, wil&#xD;
settle 9ne hundred and fifty thousand dollars, or about ,ten&#xD;
thousand dollars a year on her. My own income will make it&#xD;
up to twenty-five thousand dollars. With that and my ,affair&#xD;
all arranged, I will return to Poland, and there I will live like&#xD;

poor concern, if they depended upon the income of my Polish&#xD;
property, without other sources of income. But now I must&#xD;
finish up my career mercantile at once--bring it to an end to-&#xD;
day. It may excite wonder inold European minds why I am&#xD;
a clerk; and until my object is achieved in that quarter, I will&#xD;
end it) )',These were the unspoken thoughts of the worthy&#xD;
Count. When he had finished his coffee and cigar, he went&#xD;
around to the office of Granville &amp;amp; Wilson, in Broad street.&#xD;
The two partners were conversing together when the Count&#xD;
approached them.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said he, "I have to thank you for all your&#xD;
kindness to me while in your employ: and I am grieved to say&#xD;
thai I must leave your employment to-day."&#xD;
Both partners stood in amazement. The Count continued:&#xD;
"I am restored to my rank and position in Poland-by the&#xD;
act of His Imperial Majesty, who imposes upon me a small&#xD;
fine of twenty-five thousand dollars, which I have just received&#xD;
from my bankers, Prime, Ward &amp;amp; King, and which I must to.&#xD;
day send to the Russian Ambassador at Washington."&#xD;
Here the Count carelessly displayed the check, and Mr.&#xD;
Granville took it into his hands; and after gazing at it in stu-&#xD;
pid silence, passed it over to Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
" I have in my baiker'shands, in cash and good securities,&#xD;
about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars-so you see that,&#xD;
I can get along very well. I would remain with you longer,&#xD;
but I must make my preparations to go to Russia and take my&#xD;
place-my real position-and manage my estates, which have&#xD;
been very long neglected. Will you give me a check for what&#xD;
may be due me-it is not much,' added the Count.&#xD;
The conversation of the Count was like the shock of an elee.&#xD;
trick battery. Mr. Granville was astonished ;-Mr. Wilson was&#xD;
less- so, and coolly made up the account of the Count, and&#xD;
drew a check for three hundred and twenty dollars.&#xD;
"That is the amount-due you, Count," remarked Mr. Wil-&#xD;
son; "will you 'sign a receipt for it ?"&#xD;
Meanwhile Mr. Granville recovered his speech, and listened&#xD;
to further explanations about the Count's affairs. When the&#xD;
receipt was signed, the, Count again thanked the two partners,&#xD;
and took his departure. They looked at each other for some&#xD;
time in silence.&#xD;
"That is a rum chicken, that Count, but I can hardly believe&#xD;
that he is humbugging us. That check at least was genuine.&#xD;

hands! Impossible ! Good God, if I had but known that !"&#xD;
exclaimed Mr. Granville.&#xD;
I Mr. Wilson did not seem at all surprised, and when Mr.&#xD;
Granville observed that'he meant to seeone of the firm that&#xD;
day, and ask if what the Count had stated'was true, Mr. Wil-&#xD;
son remarked that it was useless-that he knew he had money&#xD;
there. This did not discourage Mr. Granville, for ere two&#xD;
hours had passed, he had ascertained from Mr. King that the&#xD;
Connt Falsechinski had kept an account there. for years, and&#xD;
that he had over two hundred thousand dollars in their hands;&#xD;
and Mr. King added, that if Mr. Granville thought of having&#xD;
any financial transactions -with the Count, he would find /him&#xD;
perfectly safe to an unlimited amount..&#xD;
Mr. Granville returned to his-own office mortified to a degree&#xD;
that he could hardly have believed. "I did not believe, Wil-&#xD;
son, that the man had five hundred cents ;" and then he mut-&#xD;
tered something about locking the stable door after the horse&#xD;
was stolen, implying that he had had it in his power to have'&#xD;
made a warm friend of the Count, but had neglected to do so,&#xD;
until the time -had arrived when the Count was in such a plea-&#xD;
sant position that he needed no friends. "What, a most con-&#xD;
summate ass I have been," was the only consolation that Mr.&#xD;
Granville could find for what he deemed the most stupid stu-&#xD;
pidity. It was too late, however, to mend matters fully, but&#xD;
Mr. Granville resolved to do the best that he could under the&#xD;
circumstances, which was to be extremely civil to the Count,&#xD;
and trust-to chance for the result.&#xD;
The Count, when he left the office of Mr. Granville, pro-&#xD;
ceeded directly to Clark &amp;amp; Brown's, in Maiden Lane. As we&#xD;
haye related, there he found Marion, somewhat depressed in&#xD;
spirits, and he addressed him in a cheerful manner.&#xD;
"Cheer up, my boy, and open a new chapter. Have you a&#xD;
pen and ink handy ?"&#xD;
Marion procured him one from a little desk in one corner of&#xD;
the i-oom. The Count seated himself at the table, and took out&#xD;
the check for three hundred and twenty dollars that he  had&#xD;
received from Granville &amp;amp; Wilson. He indorsed it, for it was&#xD;
drawn to order, and passed it over to Marion, saying pleasantly,&#xD;
"Will you go and get, that money, Marion ?"&#xD;
"Certainly.  Shall I bring it back to you ?  Will. you&#xD;
wait ?" replied Marion.&#xD;
" No-I have not time," said the Count.&#xD;
" What shall I do 'with the money, then ?"&#xD;
" Put it in your pocket, my dear boy, for-it is yours Don't&#xD;

bother me. Spend it, and when you want more, let me know.&#xD;
I have got work for you to do, but not quite yet. You must&#xD;
get out of this hole. I don't like it. Can't you find no other&#xD;
place to live in except this ?" asked the Count.&#xD;
Marion replied that he could and would that day. "Count,&#xD;
you do not know how you have relieved my mind. I have no&#xD;
money left. I could not have. paid the very trifling amount t&#xD;
owe here, but for your kindness. How shall I repay it -"&#xD;
asked Marion, feelingly-.&#xD;
" It has already been paid to me in advance, Marion, by-,&#xD;
you.- Now I will repay you some part of the large debt which&#xD;
I owe you. I am not quite'ready yet. When you have scw&#xD;
elected a new place, write me a ine to that effect, and leave it&#xD;
at Prime, Ward &amp;amp; King's. I have left Granville &amp;amp; Co. That&#xD;
-check was for a balance due me, and closed my account there&#xD;
forever. God bless you, my boy--take care of yourself! You&#xD;
will be all right before long ;" and with these hopeful words,&#xD;
the Count left.&#xD;
"I have one friend left, and I will do at once what he re-&#xD;
commends-but first to draw the money," said Marion to him-&#xD;
self. He went at once, I nd received the money for the check.&#xD;
Then it occurred to him, -hat when long previous he had called&#xD;
upon. Mr. Bennett at his room in Nassau street, he had noticed&#xD;
a bill upon the house, with "Rooms to let."  He hurried up&#xD;
there. First, he inquired for Mr. Bennett. He was'still re-&#xD;
siding in the house, but was at his oiice. Then he engaged&#xD;
the back room on the same floor, and paid a month's board in&#xD;
advance. This done, he proceeded to Clark &amp;amp; Brown's, paid&#xD;
his bill, got a cartman, and took his baggage to his new quar-&#xD;
ters. The next step was to write a note to the Count, inforim-&#xD;
ing him of his new location, and this he took to Prime &amp;amp; Co.'s&#xD;
office, and left it.&#xD;
It was late in the afternoon before Marion had concluded Iis&#xD;
work. He went at once to No. 46 Centre street. There he&#xD;
found Cplonel Mac Neil, with whom he had retained an inti-&#xD;
macy during all this period. Mac Neil had been a true friend;&#xD;
and the young clerk had the good sense to respect him more in&#xD;
his fallen fortunes, than when he knew him prosperous and&#xD;
successful. A man of the world like Colonef Mac Neil had -it&#xD;
in his power to give many instructive examples to a youth like&#xD;
Marion, and he had not failed to do so upon every occasion.. At&#xD;
this visit, however, Marion seemed possessed-of the attributes&#xD;
of manhood. lie shook hands with the ColoneL. There were&#xD;

asked all hands up to drink, and then he sat down by Mae&#xD;
Neil&#xD;
"Colonel,-this is a funny world, is it not? Queer changes&#xD;
occur ;" he remarked.&#xD;
"Just found it out" abruptly asked the Colonel.&#xD;
"This morning I *as dead broke-.-not a red. Owed Clark&#xD;
&amp;amp; Brown nineteen dollars: Look here ;" and Marion, as he&#xD;
spoke, exhibited a roll of money.&#xD;
. " Put that up at once," said Mac Neil, sternly. "You do&#xD;
not know who may notice it. Never show money---no gentle-&#xD;
man does so. Besides, in such a place as this it is dangerous.&#xD;
It might cost you tie loss of the money and a broken skull.&#xD;
There are men in this room at this moment who would not hes-&#xD;
itate to give you a clip over the head for the sake of a five dol-&#xD;
lar gold piece ; but tell me all about this sudden change of&#xD;
fortune."&#xD;
Marion related, all to him. He only replied, "That Count&#xD;
is a deep one. I never could make him out satisfactorily- to&#xD;
myself. I ever believed him to be a sharper and a sham.' I&#xD;
may be mistaken. That three hundred and twenty dollar check&#xD;
would lead me to a different conclusion."&#xD;
" Colonel, will you not be angry with me if I presume to do&#xD;
something ?" asked Marion, in a very apologetic voice.&#xD;
"I am not apt to get angry with you, my boy," replied Col-&#xD;
onel Mac Neil.&#xD;
"I want you to take fifty dollars of this money. I counted&#xD;
it out before I came in here, and I have placed it in my side&#xD;
pocket---here it is ;"'and as he spoke he poured the money'ifnto&#xD;
the hands of the Colonel. The tears started in the old man of&#xD;
the world's eyes as he received the money.&#xD;
"What do you wish me to do with it ?' he asked.&#xD;
"Keep it, to be sure. I thought it might serve you, and I&#xD;
might throw it away. If I should need it, I vill come to you,"&#xD;
observed Marion, delicately.&#xD;
- " Upon such conditions then I accept it. Wait a moment."&#xD;
The Colonel passed to the bar, and spoke a few words to Hen-&#xD;
ry, the proprietor, and handed him the money. Then he re-&#xD;
turned to the side of Marion. The latter remarked,&#xD;
"Colonel, you seem to know this crowd, or they all know&#xD;
you. Who are they ?"&#xD;
"I will ask them all up to take another drink, and then I&#xD;
will tell you," replied the Colonel.&#xD;
'.his was accordingly done, and the Colonel continued :&#xD;
"Notice that stout man who is seated upon a barrel, talking&#xD;

"1Who is the venerable old man with gray hair who is talk-&#xD;

"That is Pop Junk. He keeps a junk shop down near the&#xD;
Five Points. He has been in the State Prison for ten years,&#xD;

Mac Neil, "but they are hardly worth knowing, except to one&#xD;
who is old and experienced enough not to be injured by com-&#xD;

Marion remained with the Colonel until evening, and then&#xD;
bade him good night and went to his new boarding-house.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
Old Mr. Prime and Mr. Gra per-The Coant to marry Irene Grasper -The&#xD;
Dinner at Mr. Prime' s--Satisfaction all around.&#xD;
No sooner had the Count Falsechinki left the banking house&#xD;
of Prime, Ward &amp;amp; King, than the senior partner of that great&#xD;
firm took his hat, and soon after could have been found in the&#xD;
directors' room of one of the principal city banks.  He was&#xD;
one of the directors of the institution, and Mr. John Grasper&#xD;
was another.. Soon after the latter arrived, and the two old'&#xD;
millionaires were engaged in a very earnest conversation. Now&#xD;
and then a sudden but very emphatic exclamation could have&#xD;
been heard from Grasper.&#xD;
" What ! a real Count ? None of those impostors !-are you&#xD;
sure of it ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
255&#xD;
&#xD;
Then Mr. Prime's low tones assured his friend- that of this&#xD;
there was not a shadow of. a doubt.  Again Grasper would&#xD;
open his lips-&#xD;
"Income of his estate twenty-five thousand pounds sterling&#xD;
-impossible !"&#xD;
But when he was again assured that whatever might be the&#xD;
income of the Count's estates in Poland, there was no mistake&#xD;
in the fact that the firm held cash and securities to the extent&#xD;
of a quarter of million of dollars, his astonishment seemed to&#xD;
have reached a climax, for he was perfectly silent. There was&#xD;
no occasion for expressing incredulity in a. financial matter,&#xD;
when Mr. Nat Prime stood ready to guarantee it.&#xD;
It was some moments before the parties opened their mouths&#xD;
again, when the celebrated banker continued the conversa-&#xD;
tion-m&#xD;
"Yes, Grasper, my old friend, the best you can do. You&#xD;
say your daughter has no previous attachment."&#xD;
" None that I know of. In fact I ai quite sure not, and I&#xD;
have no particular objection that it shall be a match if all. that&#xD;
you say of this Count proves true," said Grasper, in a very&#xD;
quiet manner.&#xD;
1" If !" exclaimed Mr. Prime with some spirit--" do you&#xD;
doubt my word, old friend ?"&#xD;
" Not in the least, but it is a large sum, a very large sum.&#xD;
A quarter of a million.! And suppose these two young people&#xD;
should become attached, what would I be expected to do ?--&#xD;
that is, what sum would I have to settle on my daughter ?"&#xD;
asked his companion.&#xD;
." Now you begin to talk up to the mark; why, I suppose&#xD;
,the advantage of noble blood and all that sort of thing, you&#xD;
ought to put down as much cash on the nail . as your . future&#xD;
son-in-law can show, eh ?" said the banker.&#xD;
"I shall do nothing of the kind, but I will'do this; if you&#xD;
will satisfy me that this Count has all you say, is all, you say,&#xD;
I will put down as the portion of my daughter one hundred.&#xD;
.and fifty thousand dollars when the parties are married," said&#xD;
the other.&#xD;
: " Do I understand you to mean that you will give it to her,&#xD;
out and out ?" demanded the banker.&#xD;
" Not exactly. I will place that sumin the hands of -our&#xD;
house to be invested in a manner most satisfactory, to the&#xD;
Count. The property or the income to be used by the'married&#xD;
couple, and to go to any children that my daughter may have&#xD;
by the Count," said Mr. Grasper&#xD;
&#xD;

26&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, no, that won't do. It is not fair for the Count; give&#xD;
it out and out to your daughter when she marries him: I will&#xD;
see that it is properly invested. Don't tie them up.  If the&#xD;
count were a beggar it wobld be different, but he is not. Ie&#xD;
i$ amply provided for, worth all or more than I tell you, and&#xD;
the amount that you give to your daughter under the existing&#xD;
circumstances should not be encumbered with conditions. You&#xD;
are not going to live forever, and you will have a nice sum to&#xD;
leave somebody when you die. Use your judgment when you&#xD;
come to making your will. Then you can settle upon your&#xD;
daughter what-you think fit," shrewdly observed the banker.&#xD;
Right, old friend.  I am  satisfied that your advice is&#xD;
good. Now when shall I see my future son-in-law ?" asked&#xD;
the old man.&#xD;
"I will have him on the course to-morrow, and you can trot&#xD;
out your filly at the same time-that is to say, come and dine&#xD;
with me to-morrow, and bring Irene with you ; I will have&#xD;
the Count there," was the answer. I&#xD;
I will come ; and now let us shake hands upon our agreed*&#xD;
ment; I am much obliged to you for proposing it," observed&#xD;
Mr Grasper.&#xD;
Wait a while until you see how the new team work in har-&#xD;
ness. Then thank me if you are satisfied with the match."&#xD;
The two worthies parted 'mutually satisfied.  Mr. Prime&#xD;
sometimes talked "stable." -Some people made the assertion&#xD;
that before he entered into the brokerage and banking busi-&#xD;
ness, that he had been hostler to old Billy Grey, a quiet mer.-&#xD;
chant in Boston; whether true or not is no affair- of ours. He&#xD;
did frequently use language that smacked of the stable ; and&#xD;
upon one occasion, when a friend asked kindly after one of his&#xD;
own family who had been sick, Mr. Prime replied, "She is&#xD;
better, thank you, but she has not come to her feed yet." Mr.&#xD;
Prime' also prided himself upon his knowledge of horse-flesh,&#xD;
but he did not boast of it much after a terrific sell was perpe-&#xD;
trated upon hint. He was shown a white horse, beautifully&#xD;
variegated with coal-black spots, and his owner called him the&#xD;
" leopard horse." He sold him to the' old gentleman at an&#xD;
enormous price-some say two thousand dellars. After a&#xD;
while Mr. Pripe began to believe that the .Bible, when t1_4&#xD;
asked if the leopard could change his spots, implying that he&#xD;
could not do, it, was sadly mistaken--for his leopard horse did&#xD;
change his spots, or rather all the beautiful spots washed off,&#xD;
and the horse was nothing more nor less than a plain white&#xD;
o ne. But the banker was a good old soul after all, and did&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR-&#xD;
&#xD;
257&#xD;
&#xD;
many a kind act equal in benevolence to his #friendship for&#xD;
the Count.&#xD;
The succeeding day the Count Falsechinski met at the din.&#xD;
ner table of the old banker, Mr. Grasper and his daughter. T e&#xD;
fair Irene was even more stately beautiful than when we 4&#xD;
cribed her ,appearance at a party given .by Mrs. Nordheim.......&#xD;
She was accomplished in almost every variety of the so-called&#xD;
female accomplishments. She spoke Italian and French equal.&#xD;
ly well, and much to the delight of her parent, she maintained&#xD;
a long and animated conversation with - the Count in both of&#xD;
these languages. After dinner was finished, while the two old&#xD;
fogies remained at their wi-ne, the Count excused himself and&#xD;
joined Miss Irene at the piano. There was a guitar by the&#xD;
side of the piano, which the Count took in charge, and played&#xD;
with exquisite taste and feeling, while he sang several charm.&#xD;
ing odes.  They were much pleased with each other, and the&#xD;
old people noticed this fact with great.pleasure.&#xD;
When Mr. Grasper and his daughter got ready to leave, the&#xD;
Count asked permission to accompany them, and it was readily&#xD;
granted, and on the arrival of the party at the father's splen.&#xD;
did residence, the Count received an invitation to enter, and&#xD;
spend the remainder of the evening. The Count wondered&#xD;
whether his intentions were known to the fair datusel. Mr.&#xD;
Prime had taken him aside at his residence and informed hin&#xD;
that he bad come to an understanding with Mr. -Grasper, and&#xD;
that if the Count succeeded in obtaining the consent of the&#xD;
daughter, that,-the father would give his child one hundred and&#xD;
fifty thousand dollars. This was very gratifying news to the&#xD;
Count, and-it gave an impetus to his attentions to Miss Irene&#xD;
Irene Grasper, which bid fair to win success. The Coutit' need&#xD;
have had no fear that old Mr. Grasper had communicated any&#xD;
part of what he. had heard from Mr. Prime to any member of&#xD;
his family. He was too much a man of the world, and knew&#xD;
human character too well to be guilty of any such gross act.&#xD;
He knew 'his child possessed an independent. spirit, and he&#xD;
left the Count to conquer it, and to win the young lady's affee.&#xD;
tions by his own merits.&#xD;
When the Count left-that evening he was well pleased with&#xD;
his day's work, but he added, " I am really in love nyself.-...&#xD;
She is-just the tall, stately woman I have always had in, view&#xD;
as my Countess whenever I married. What a sensation she&#xD;
will create in Paris, Warsaw, or even St. Petersburgh. I am,&#xD;
a lucky dog if I win her, even had I not the assurance of the&#xD;

street, respected by all in her church, and all those with whom&#xD;
she came in contact who did not know her real character, or&#xD;
that she was a "whited sepulchre." She had long since quar.&#xD;
relied with the Count Falsechinski, or rather that noble di-.&#xD;
vidual, after the Parker affair, consulted his prudence and out&#xD;
the good lady's acquaintance. Such sort of proceedings as&#xD;
those connected with Mrs. Parker and her daughter, assisted&#xD;
by Mr. O'Doemall, the Count deemed extremely dangerous';&#xD;
and after levying what he thought a fair tax upon such fair sin-&#xD;
ners, he withdrew from the connexion.&#xD;
But the business of Mrs.. Woodruff did not diminish. Her&#xD;
horses pranced more proudly than ever as they whirled her&#xD;
carriage down Broadway, or out upon the avenues. No grand-&#xD;
er equipage rested for its mistress at the portals of God's&#xD;
fashionable sanctuary, Grace Church, than the widow's. A&#xD;
coat-of-arms was neatly emblazoned upon the panels of the&#xD;
carriage, and her coachman and footman both wore costly liv-&#xD;
eries.-&#xD;
Her visitors increased. Ladies from the South, accompa-&#xD;
nied by their husbands, and who stopped at the leading hotels,&#xD;
left their cards, at Mrs, Woodruff's, and frequently called.&#xD;
Such ladies as were disposed to criminal indulgence, either to&#xD;
gratify their passions or to increase their pecuniary resources,&#xD;
found a friend -in. Mrs. Woodruff. Her correspondence was&#xD;
extensive. Her acquaintance with the old rou6s and men of&#xD;
wealth seemed almost incredible.&#xD;
One of the most gifted, beautiful and fascinating ladies on&#xD;
Mrs. Woodruff's list was Clara Norris. To her gentlemen cus-&#xD;
tomers pious Mrs. Woodruff represented Clara as mne of the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
most fashionable aM virtuous young married ladies in the city.&#xD;
She was the beautiful " Mrs. Sinclair," the accomplished "Mrs.&#xD;
Percy," or the wealthy "Mrs. Jones," as occasion served.&#xD;
'When Mrs. Woodruff wished to make a deep impression, a&#xD;
had a wealthy man in tow, -she would promise to introdu&#xD;
Mrs. Sinclair " to the party. "But you had better see ber&#xD;
first. I *ill get her to take a seat in my pe* at Grace Church&#xD;
next Sunday." Then the rich fool who was to be victimized&#xD;
would watch the descent of the widow and Clara at the church&#xD;
door next Sunday. He Would see a young, and as he supposed&#xD;
Married lady, glowing with beauty, meekly entering a church&#xD;
to pay her morning devotions. He coIld hardly believe it pos-&#xD;
sible that his good fortune was so great as to be able to secure&#xD;
so much beauty; and when he went to Mrs Woodruff to make&#xD;
his financial arrangements, the worthy would name as the price&#xD;
of the interview, in consequence of the great risk, or the diffi-&#xD;
culty of approaching the lady, who had plenty of money, or&#xD;
some other cause, the sum of five hundred dollars for an inter-&#xD;
view. of an hour. She never named less than one hundred&#xD;
dollars-and whether the sum was the larger or the smaller&#xD;
amount, or an intervening sum, the honest woman 'divided it&#xD;
fairly with Clara Norris.&#xD;
Clara was a great card for the widow, and the game between&#xD;
them was played for a long time with such success, that Clara&#xD;
would have been a constant visitor at the house, had not the&#xD;
parties limited her acquaintance within bounds. Some of those&#xD;
gentlemen who made h'er acquaintance wished it continued&#xD;
from day to day, at even such enormous prices, but the prudent&#xD;
and pious widow was made of sterner stuff-her rule was made,&#xD;
.and it was as unalterable as the laws of the Medes and Peri&#xD;
sians, which her minister read about-and even the five hun-&#xD;
dred dollar customer 'considered himself-fortunate if he suc-&#xD;
ceeded in seeing the fascinating syren more than once in a&#xD;
fortnight. This ganre would have continued for years, had not&#xD;
Clara herself finished it, by becoming a frequenter of houses&#xD;
of ill-fame of the first class down town.&#xD;
In Duane street, No. 106, resided for a great many years a&#xD;
most extraordinary female, of the name of Jane Graham, alPas&#xD;
Jane Graham West. It was the misfortune of Miss Norr*to&#xD;
become acquainted with this lady, whose memoirs would 6na&#xD;
-book. At that time, her house was the first in New York."It&#xD;
was visited by the most aristocratic, old and young, citizen or&#xD;
stranger. The house is still standing-a three story houserti&#xD;
far from Broadway, on the North river side. In this den, in&#xD;

&#xD;
one ofthe largest and most splendidly finished apartments&#xD;
in the house, was Clara Norris induced to take up her abode&#xD;
for a long time. Her fame soon spread, and hundreds, yea&#xD;
ousands visited the house for the purpose of seeing the ac-&#xD;
mplished'and widely talked of Clara Norris.&#xD;
The keeper of the house could play no tricks upon Clara-&#xD;
she was as shrewd as Jane Graham herself. She paid for her&#xD;
board twenty-five dollars per week-and the harvest left to&#xD;
Mrs. Graham was the immense quantities of wines sold to the&#xD;
visitors brought to the house to seeClara-and the sums she&#xD;
herself received were enormous. It was a, gay- life, and she&#xD;
liked it; and although she remained at the head of the first-&#xD;
class ladies of Mrs. Woodruff 's house, she did not like that&#xD;
mode of life as well as the one she led with Mrs. Graham.&#xD;
Clara Norris liked the society of the house where she lived.&#xD;
She -reigned a quien, and. all bowed to her supremacy. She&#xD;
thought that such a life would last forever-but after six&#xD;
months' residence in that establishment, she had a quarrel&#xD;
with Mrs. Graham and left her. She then visited for a few&#xD;
dayo hcr parents' home, and carried up with her savings bank&#xD;
credits for a very large sum \of money, obtained in the resi-&#xD;
dence of Mrs. Graham, and from her occasional visits to Mrs.&#xD;
Woodruff. She cleared in this business in the space of nine&#xD;
months oyer ten thousand dollars, and presents of'jewelry that&#xD;
almost equalled that amount  She never varied from one pur-&#xD;
pose. .,However careless or dissipated, she did not neglect&#xD;
visits to the savings bank once a week, and the sums she de-&#xD;
posited- were never equalled by any woman of her class. She&#xD;
invariably visited the bank alone, and kept her bank book from&#xD;
all eyes but her own. When she visited her father she showed&#xD;
it to him, and sometimes would say, " Father, if ever I should&#xD;
die, look out for this bank book, and claim it on call at the&#xD;
bank, and claim it as my heir." Her prudent lawyer in New-&#xD;
ton was informed of the amount she had in bank. le ex-&#xD;
planed to her how much better it 'was to have it in a safer&#xD;
way. She paid his expenses, and hecame to New York. "Un-&#xD;
der his direction, she became the owner of two. small brick&#xD;
houses in one of the cross streets below Canal, that ran .from,&#xD;
Broadway to the North river.&#xD;
Wheh thepurchase of the houses had been completed, an4, /&#xD;
the deeds taken out in her name had ,been recorded, he took&#xD;
them with him to Sussex, and deposited them in his iron safe.&#xD;
The rents from these two houses was' nirne hundred dollars.&#xD;
The worthy Jane Graham was very loth to part with Miss&#xD;

&#xD;
Norris.   Better stay, Clara; you are the best card I ever&#xD;
had in niy house. I am rich-I will leave you my business,&#xD;
and if I die, as I have no heirs, you shall be my heiress."'&#xD;
Clara turned a deaf ear to these proposals. Yet Jane Gra-&#xD;
ham West could have made all good. She owned at that tim0'&#xD;
fifty thousand dollars in United States Bank stock, and was&#xD;
worth an equal sum in other property. She made it in that&#xD;
business, and although she held on to her United States Bank&#xD;
stock until it was worthless, yk she seemed no poorer. She&#xD;
fell in love with a youig ulate of one of the Havre packet ships,&#xD;
named Frederick Hewitt. He promised the old dame marriage,&#xD;
and she bought him one-half of the ship Manhattan, and made&#xD;
him captain of her. He refused to marry her after he. became&#xD;
a commander, and married a young lady in Mobile. Jane&#xD;
Graham sue' him 'for a breach of promise of marriage, and one&#xD;
of the most ridiculous law trials took place between these par-&#xD;
ties that ever occurred in any country. The lady recovered&#xD;
six cents damages, and the captain a ridiculous notoriety that&#xD;
followed him to the grave. He did not live long afterwards,&#xD;
and the lady, Jane Graham, after the loss of her United States&#xD;
Bank stock, took it-into her head that she was beggared, and&#xD;
never held up her head more. She was abandoned by all, of&#xD;
her girls, and left alone in that large house, her only compan-&#xD;
ion being a negro hag.&#xD;
Jenny Graham was found strangled one morning. It was a&#xD;
question whether the deed was done by the negro woman or by&#xD;
Jenny herself; but as the latter had frequently threatened to&#xD;
put an end to her own life, the negress got the benefit of it.&#xD;
Her two nephews turned up, and although they came into pos-&#xD;
session of over sixty thousand dollars each, from Jennys death,&#xD;
and werelmiserably poor before it happened, yet the ungrateful&#xD;
wretches boxed her up in a wooden coffin, and sent her with-&#xD;
out expense to Potter's Field. Such was the end of a remark-&#xD;
able woman, who for many years was a warm friend and a great&#xD;
admirer of Clara Norris.&#xD;
When Miss Norris returned from her home, after her quar-&#xD;
rel w'th Jane Graham, she made a short stay at the palace of&#xD;
Mrs. Woodruff. But it was too gloomy for her-more espe-&#xD;
cially as she had now got a taste for a free and easy life.&#xD;
I must follow the bent of my inclinations, and I cannot&#xD;
help it, good woman," was her reply to Mrs. Woodruff, 'whoin&#xD;
vain remonstrated with Clara Norris against her becoming a.&#xD;
public character.the.e&#xD;
"You will ruin yourself, body and soul. .You will spoil&#xD;
&#xD;

your market, my beauty, and that will be the upshot of this&#xD;
business," observed Mrs. Woodruff.&#xD;
"Can't help it-can't help it, if I die for it.&#xD;
"'There is a destiny that shapes our ends,&#xD;
Rough hew them as we will'&#xD;
as Shakespeare says, and mine is fixed, Mrs. Woodruff. I&#xD;
must pursue my own career."&#xD;
And true enough, a few days after this conversation Miss&#xD;
Norris was a resident in a house of a lowpr grade than that of&#xD;
Jane Graham. She went to reside with Mrs. Miller, one of&#xD;
the most extraordinaay women of her class in New York.-&#xD;
When Miss Norris went with. her, the age of the old lady was&#xD;
fast verging upon seventy years.&#xD;
About this time Clara met the Count Falsechinski in the&#xD;
street.. He stopped, and politely accosted her. She gave him&#xD;
her address--" Mrs. Miller, No. 114 Church street."  The&#xD;
Count looked at it a moment.&#xD;
"Good God, Miss Norris! Are you in that house from ne-&#xD;
cessity, or to please yourself'?" he asked.&#xD;
" To gratify my own curiosity, Count," she replied. "I&#xD;
want to get acquainted with this w6man. She is a study to&#xD;
me. Do you know, Count, that she is the mother of Josephine&#xD;
Clifton, the great actress?  Do you know; also, that she is the&#xD;
mother of Miss Missguri, that Hamlin is just bringing out, and&#xD;
who promises to be equal in genius and talent to her splendid&#xD;
sister, Josephine ?"&#xD;
"Indeed, Miss Clara, I did not know it. But I must say&#xD;
good-bye -I will-call and see you ere long ;" and the Count&#xD;
passed on.&#xD;
"'Afraid to be seen speaking to me in the street," remarked&#xD;
Miss Norris, after the Count's sudden departure.  "Well, it&#xD;
is the way of the world. I ought not to have expected differ-&#xD;
ent treatment."&#xD;
For some months Miss Norris was' a resident of Mrs. Miller's,&#xD;
but she found the old lady a miserly old woman, without one&#xD;
redeeming feature. She became acquainted with one of her&#xD;
sons named Nelson Miller, on whom  the old woman lavished&#xD;
her affections and her money. Clara became disgusted with&#xD;
the old woman, and again made a, removal, but this time it was&#xD;
back to Mrs. Woodruff's, where we shall for the present; leave&#xD;
her.&#xD;

Miss Margaret Benson.&#xD;
THE marriage of Middleton Benson to Isabella Granville&#xD;
although a 'very sudden affair, seemed to give the fathers of the&#xD;
young.couple the most unbounded satisfaction. Mr. Granville&#xD;
gave up his house to the young people, and even went so far as&#xD;
to deed' to them  all the costly furniture that it contained.&#xD;
Colonel Benson was not behind hand. He made the bride -the&#xD;
most costly presents, and so far as household furniture was&#xD;
concerned, he purchased a sufficient quantity to have started a&#xD;
dozen new married couples in all necessary articles for house-&#xD;
keeping. Spacious and roomy as was the old State street man-&#xD;
sion, yet every room was crowded with furniture, and pre-&#xD;
sented an odd mixture of old and new fashions.&#xD;
The young couple appeared very happy. Isabella did not&#xD;
seem to have lost any portion of her gaiety, and her laugh was.&#xD;
as merry and cheering as of old. Their a~ earance seemed to&#xD;
confirm the father in his belief that all he Tad done had been&#xD;
for the hest. Middleton Benson, his son-in-law, had been ad-&#xD;
mitted a partner into the commercial firm where he had been&#xD;
so long a clerk, and his father retired from it, giving to his son&#xD;
the interest and the capital that belonged to him as a partner.&#xD;
Every few evenings the two fathers would meet, and over a&#xD;
bottle or two of choice wine would congratulate themselves&#xD;
upon the happy results of their proceedings. From Mrs.&#xD;
Thomas Granville they had not heard except indirectly. She&#xD;
was living with her aged grandmother, and long since had suc-&#xD;
ceeded ip obtaining from the Maryland Legislature an act&#xD;
which divorced her from her husband, but the departure of&#xD;
Mrs. Granville had not altered Mr. Pitt Granville's domestic&#xD;
arrangements. He never spoke of her to his daughter-never&#xD;
missed her. She had attempted to'interfere with his domestic&#xD;
purposes, and to use his own expressive sentence to Colonel&#xD;
Benson, "I kicked her out of the house, and that is the end of&#xD;
her so far as I am concerned."&#xD;

VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
. There was one chosen old friend that Mr. Granville missed&#xD;
sadly. It was Colonel Mae Neil. He even went so far as to&#xD;
send a note to th4 Colonel, inviting him to renew his inti.&#xD;
macy. The Colonel was poor, but he was a proud man. He&#xD;
could not get over the fact that in the dire extremity to which&#xD;
his firm was reduced, Granville, his friend, had refused relief,-&#xD;
and at a moment so late that his failure was the consequence.&#xD;
" It might have happened later," would the Colonel reason,,&#xD;
"but then, that probability ought not to weigh in favor of&#xD;
Granville's course. He did refuse me a small loan which he&#xD;
had promised, and even if he had lost it all, what was that to&#xD;
him?&#xD;
The Colonel sternly resisted all overtures, and took no no-&#xD;
tice of Mr. Granville's note, except to exhibit it to every mu-&#xD;
tual friend that he met. Not only did Colonel Mac Neil refuse&#xD;
to associate with Mr. Granville, but lie also dropped all ac-&#xD;
quaintance with Colonel Benson and his family, where he had&#xD;
been a great favorite. -,His place, however, as a visitor at the&#xD;
residence of Colonel Benson, was fully supplied by Frank&#xD;
Gaillard, He was a regular and a constant visitor, and, Miss&#xD;
Margaret rarely went out without being accompanied by her&#xD;
lover, as he styled himself. The poor girl was completely&#xD;
fascinated with this arch deceiver. She loved him with her&#xD;
whole soul, and it was noticed by her mother,, that' from being&#xD;
a lively and gay girl, she was frequently much depressed in&#xD;
spirits and often found in tears. In vain did her mother seek&#xD;
her confidence, and endeavor to fathom the -cause of her wo.&#xD;
Did she ask if Mr. Gaillard had told her that he loved her I&#xD;
Margaret replied with the simple word "Yes."&#xD;
" Has he proposed to marry you ?"&#xD;
The reply of the poor girl, with .a deep drawn sigh, was&#xD;
That was all that could be obtained from Margaret. The&#xD;
mother felt that there was some thing wrong, and mentioned the&#xD;
facts to her husband. Tne Colonel laughed at her. Called her&#xD;
a silly, anxious old woman, and then forgot all about it. That&#xD;
Frank Gaillard or any other white man alive, dared to dreamt&#xD;
of doing him or any member of his family a deep wrong, never&#xD;
entered into his brain. He conceived such a thing impossible.&#xD;
Meanwhile, time passed along, and while poor Margaret Bensou&#xD;
drooped more and more, the young Southerner, Francis Gail-&#xD;
lard,- became less and less devoted to the sweet girl. From&#xD;
being a daily visitor, he ceased to call but once a week. Then&#xD;
once in two weeks, and at last his visits suddenly ceased, and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
the poor but proud spirited girl bent to the rod whein she&#xD;
 learned that Mr. Gaillard had left New York for his home in&#xD;
the South. She read his name among the passengers by a ves-&#xD;
sel that had sailed for Charleston. Still, she spoke not to her&#xD;
parents of the intense agony that his departure had caused.&#xD;
She seemed stupified, and a few days after his departure she,&#xD;
called at the office of Mr. Granville, and asked to see him&#xD;
alone.&#xD;
Certainly, my dear young lady, come at once in my private&#xD;
office, and tell me what I can do for you. -Some thmg is on&#xD;
your mind," ]indly remarked Mr. Granville.&#xD;
Miss Benson followed him into the inner office, and when&#xD;
she was seated she asked if he would confer a favor upon her*&#xD;
for-a few days.&#xD;
"And not mention it to my father, or any one of the fam-&#xD;
ily? she imploringly inquired.&#xD;
If you do not wish me to do so," was the reply Of her&#xD;
father's friend Granville,&#xD;
I wish to borrow of you fifty dollars " said Miss Benson&#xD;
Mr. Granville replied, Withrpleasare, immediately," and&#xD;
walked into the front ofie-n4 feeured the noney from the&#xD;
cashier. He was frighten e  m  yo.che did not know what to&#xD;
say or what to- do. Somo#lg was wong. What could it&#xD;
be?   Why did she not ge to here &amp;amp;dre   mother, brother?&#xD;
Why come to him?   As he anded her the money, he pleas-&#xD;
antly observed, " Really "--but she shook her finger.&#xD;
"No questions arc to be asked, and more'than that, not a&#xD;
word is to be said to my parents or any of my relations,  I&#xD;
shall see you this evening at our house, shall I not ?"&#xD;
I .Mr. Granville bowed, and followed her to the door. When&#xD;
she had left him, he sat down for several minutes to try and.&#xD;
fathom the mystery. The young lady went directly from Mr.&#xD;
Granville's office to that of George Sutton, thee agent of the&#xD;
packet line that plied between New York and Charleston.&#xD;
There she inquired when the first vessel sailed for Charleston.&#xD;
She was told that a ship  would sail the nest day, and she in.1 .&#xD;
stantly paid for the passage of a lady, and thus accomplished,&#xD;
and obtainig the exact hour. when the ship would sail. she .&#xD;
wended her way home. That evening Ihe was the gayest of&#xD;
the gay. Early the next morning she sent a carpet bag to a&#xD;
store in Broadway by a servant, saying that it was -goods she&#xD;
had purchiased, but wished to return About noon she dressed&#xD;
herself as if for a walk--went to the store, and took the carpet&#xD;
.bag. In the street. she hired a porter, who took it oni board&#xD;

the ship, and she went on board and retired to her state-room.&#xD;
Thatafternoon the vessel went down with the tide and a fair&#xD;
breeze and passed the Narrows..&#xD;
When dinner time came liss Benson was missed, 'but no&#xD;
alarm was exerteduin the mids of any of her relations. The&#xD;
tea hour came, but no Margaret, and then the mother became&#xD;
somewhat alarmed, but not seriously.  So she sent a message&#xD;
to Mr. Granville's house to have Miss Margaret come home.&#xD;
Then: her brother, Middleton Benson, came, and when he said&#xD;
his sister had not been there that day, the whole house was&#xD;
alarmed, and the utmost confus*on prevailed. The male mein-&#xD;
bers of the family started in diferent directions, but up to a&#xD;
late hour that night no clue could be obtained of the missing&#xD;
one. The next day the search was renewed, but with no more&#xD;
success than had been obtained the previous day.   When&#xD;
Margaret was first missed, suspicion was attaobhed to Francis&#xD;
Gaillard, but his having departed for Charleston cleared him&#xD;
.in their minds. Mr. Granville did not mention for some time&#xD;
the -circumstance of her borrowing the fifty dollars. No sooner&#xD;
had he mentioned this than the mother exclaimed, "Is it pos-&#xD;
sible that she can have used that money to follow Gaillard to&#xD;
Charleston ?"  This started the pursuit on. a new track. At&#xD;
the office they found that a young lady had taken a passage in&#xD;
the ship that had :sailed for Charleston three days previous&#xD;
The description answered to Margaret. "I will follow my&#xD;
child in the next ship,".exclaimed the agonized fatheir-and he-&#xD;
did so.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
The Rsealities of Mr. O'Donall- Ris Expergnes among Boarding,&#xD;
House Keepers.&#xD;
Soor after the Count Falseceninski had quarrelled with Ma-&#xD;
dame Woodruff, that worthy lady turned her attentions toward&#xD;
Mr. O'Doemall. Slhe bad seen that gentleman frequently in&#xD;
,,companywith Mrs. Parker, and admired his' unparalleled im-&#xD;
'pudence.She invited him to escort her to church on Sunday&#xD;
u ni  . ai                  YasBa decoy. 'But the, fact&#xD;
Was, she was afraid of him, for O'Doemall was boisterous-a&#xD;
loud talker and p great boaster. Mrs.he Worunfa, ons th cota-&#xD;

&#xD;
she could have prevented her right hand from -knowing what&#xD;
the left hand was doing, would have done it. It can easily be&#xD;
imagined that an .alliance between two such opposite charac.&#xD;
.ers would not last long.&#xD;
Mr. O'DoemalI was a great spendthrift, and when he could&#xD;
no longer obtain funds:from Mrs. Parker, and was thrown up-&#xD;
on his own resources, he became very short of cash. Mrs.&#xD;
Woodruff furnished him with an outfit, and M1r. O'DoemIall&#xD;
could again promenade Broadway the well-dressed gentleman,&#xD;
and the observed of all Broadway observers.  Mr. O'Doemal&#xD;
was one of the most accomplished scamps that ever-floated on&#xD;
the fashionable scum in New York.  A large portion of his&#xD;
time was occupied in prowling about New York, seeking fe-&#xD;
male victims. . He had a keen eye, and could tell at a glance&#xD;
such as would suit his purpose. He watched for them early&#xD;
in the morning, and half the afternoon.  Sometimes upon the&#xD;
Battery, and oftener in St. John's Park, and the parks and&#xD;
squares and places'up town.&#xD;
On one occasion'he met a young and pretty girl in St. John's&#xD;
Park. O'Doemall had procured a key that would open the&#xD;
gates. He made bold to accost her, and discovered that she&#xD;
was of English stock-and while lie apologized in the most&#xD;
humble manner for his boldness in addressing her, yet he ma-&#xD;
naged to throw in the announcenient that he was an English&#xD;
Captain, nephew to some English Peer, and that he was pass-.&#xD;
ing through the city on his way to join his regiment in Cana-&#xD;
da. The young lady allowed him to escort'her home,'and then&#xD;
introduced him to her father, who really was a half-pay officer&#xD;
in the English service. Luckily. for O'Doenall he was well&#xD;
posted in the locality of the English regiments, and the names&#xD;
of their officers, and for a long time was ,not detected.  He&#xD;
even went so far as to borrow a hundred dollars from the fa-&#xD;
ther.&#xD;
He made rapid advances in the affections of the young lady,&#xD;
and the night rambles in St. John's Park, (one of the worst&#xD;
assignation.places and where more Joveliness has been wrecked&#xD;
than in any house of ill-fame in the pity.) soon completed her&#xD;
ruin. He then promised to marry her if she would ,eave home&#xD;
and go with him to a small town on the New Jersey coast. She&#xD;
consented, and the father became a broken-hearted man. .He&#xD;
followed the seducer to Canada, where he supposed he had&#xD;
gone, and there met the real officer, whose name O'D~oenal1&#xD;
'had takeni, and whose rank he had assumed, and. learned hiow&#xD;
grossly he had been deceived. Bat he could :get no elaetp&#xD;

&#xD;
O'Doemall, 1uad he went back to England. The instant O'Do4&#xD;
emaIl becaino' aware of the fact, he brought his victim to New&#xD;
York, placed heir in a brothel; and then abandoned her forever.&#xD;
She of course became a girl of the town at once, for she had&#xD;
no other resource left.&#xD;
It was not unfrequently that Mr. O'Doemall was turned out&#xD;
of his hotel. He had used himself up in every prominent oni&#xD;
in the city.  There was not one that he had not swindled.&#xD;
JBlancard once. said that it was really a pleasure to be victim-&#xD;
ized by him, as his explanation and apologies, were "so very&#xD;
funny and interesting" HRe managed to pay. the rent of his&#xD;
office in New street, so' that if he was turned out of a hotel,&#xD;
lie could rally at his office.  He would go there when thus&#xD;
turned out, pack up two or more large trunks with bricks,&#xD;
boards, and rubbish, hire a cartman, and tell him to drive to&#xD;
some private boarding house. He had a list, and would select&#xD;
one whete it was not probable that he could be known. Once&#xD;
in the house, he .would select the most extravagant apart-&#xD;
ments to be had, find fault with every thing, and play the rich&#xD;
Southerner, or any other character which he had adopted. /&#xD;
A glance at the parties assembled around the dining-room&#xD;
table would serve to convey to O'Doemall the pecliarities of&#xD;
any person present.- His conversation,, dress, and impudence,&#xD;
would sweep down all opposition.  Th n he would, before&#xD;
twenty-four hours had passed, ingratiate himself fully with&#xD;
the landlady, and if she had one or two daughters his game&#xD;
was secure. He would notice that one' daughter was receiving&#xD;
the attentions of a young man boarding in the house. OIDo-&#xD;
emall would boldly say to the young lady, "Miss, I am aston-&#xD;
ished that you associate with or permit the attentions of that&#xD;
young man. I tell you this in confidence, for I am a warm&#xD;
friend of your mother ; but this young man -(he, must have&#xD;
been drunk, I think)-told me in confidence last night that he&#xD;
had no idea of-marrying you, because he slept with you fre-&#xD;
quently, without any such ceremony." To the youth in ques-&#xD;
tiof, O'Doemall had previously told him that the landlady saw,&#xD;
through him, and had said that lie "was trying to marry her&#xD;
daughter in order to sponge out his' board billl" .&#xD;
Thesebarefaced assertions would quickly make Pandemoni-&#xD;
um of the most pious boarding houses in the city-a-and if Mr.&#xD;
Q'Doemal'l was ever called upon for any explanation, he would&#xD;
face the music, and declare the asserons had been made to&#xD;
hiin by the parties themselves. If lie accidentally met the&#xD;
'wife of any rather weak-minded boarder 'i the street .alone,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
269&#xD;
&#xD;
O'Doenall would hurry down to the gentleman's place of&#xD;
business, beg him not. to get angry, as he only wished to say&#xD;
that he saw his wife entering such a house with such a cler-&#xD;
gyman, (if there was one boarding in the house,), and that he-&#xD;
the husband had better look .into the matter. The house would&#xD;
be some private assignation house, and O'Doemall knew every&#xD;
one in the city.&#xD;
A month would generally raise particular Ned in the board-&#xD;
ing house, if it had not nearly ruined it, and the mischief-ma-&#xD;
ker would be the powerful adviser of all the, belligerents ,and&#xD;
the particular friend of the landlady. If he was called upon&#xD;
for money, he had a hundred excuses ready, but le generally&#xD;
contrived to make such a scene of confusion in the house, that&#xD;
money was unthought of. When his game was nearly played&#xD;
out, after living on the fat of the' land for four or six months,&#xD;
and landlady and boarders were loud in their execrations, aud&#xD;
anxious to get rid of him at any price, O'Doeniall would deter-&#xD;
mine to leave a sting behind whiph should provei a deadly~one,&#xD;
If it was at dinner, he would rise and say, "Ladies and gen-&#xD;
tlemen, I am forced to leave this. house. It is extremely un-&#xD;
pleasant for me to remain here longer.  The pious landlady&#xD;
has made a statement that I am in arrears for board. ,What&#xD;
will you think when I tell you that I have let her lave ten,&#xD;
twenty, and fifty dollars at a time?  She has come to my bed&#xD;
night after night'for months, -nd now she says that she is.in a&#xD;
delicate situation--that- I am the author of her misfortune,&#xD;
and wants me to marry her.  Of course I shall do nothing of&#xD;
the kind-I will leave the house first."&#xD;
The landlady would generally faint at such an -infamous&#xD;
charge, and the daughters would scream. The boarders would&#xD;
be perfectly aghast, and some believe. it, and the lying scoun-&#xD;
drel would walk out in triumph.  No one would take it up.&#xD;
The very enormity of the charge would make the innocent ob-&#xD;
jects of it quail, and exhibit all the terror of real guilt. Or&#xD;
perhaps it would be a landlady who-in a moment of weakness&#xD;
had become a victim to this arch deceiver ; he would then live&#xD;
on her for weeks and months, borrow all her earnings, and not&#xD;
leave until he had ruined and broken up her establishment,&#xD;
Mr. O'Doemall in a quiet boarding house, could only be re-&#xD;
presented by a fierce, unrelenting hawk, quartered in a barn-&#xD;
yard surrounded by a peaceful lot of roosters, hens, and differ-&#xD;
ent sized chickens. It was all one side ; the poor domestic&#xD;
fowls stood no sort of chance.&#xD;
In his business, no ene could get any hold of him. His of-&#xD;

flee or store rent was cheap, and that he ,paid promptly'. He&#xD;
had a handsome business card, and he paid two dollars and a&#xD;
half a thousand for them. These alone gave him respectabili-&#xD;
ty and position with strangers, for who could gainsay it,? He&#xD;
could be found at his store ; and many a tailor, shoemaker, dry&#xD;
goods dealer, and tradesman, was victimized to a greater- or&#xD;
less extent, He owed alL  But those who sued, made costs&#xD;
for themselves. His very furniture in the office could not be&#xD;
disturbed, for it was mortgaged to the landlord.  The only&#xD;
way for his victini was to laugh, for O'Doemall did find associ-&#xD;
stes with gentlemen, and particularly among English noble-&#xD;
men or gentry, and he would take these persons to shops that&#xD;
he knew, and owed money to.&#xD;
His malice was intense and fearful. He made a'purchase of&#xD;
some wine of one. of the most sturdy merchants in the city.&#xD;
This man was a member of Dr. Spring's church.  He refused&#xD;
to let him have the wine until he paid for it. The swindler&#xD;
swore vengeance.  Unluckily the merchant left New York on&#xD;
a visit of some weeks' duration. O'Doeniall managed to put&#xD;
himself in the way of all this merchant's acquaintance, and as&#xD;
if by accident, mentioned his-regret that-so fine an old mer-&#xD;
chant should be so sorely afflicted-that he visitpd him once a&#xD;
month in the Bloomingdale asylum, where he was -confined as&#xD;
a mad man.&#xD;
No matter who starts sucl a story as this; where there is a&#xD;
shadow fof foundation, it runs like Greek fire, and is very&#xD;
speedily so extensively spread, that in a large city it cannot&#xD;
be traced to tire real author. O'Doenall was revenged-the&#xD;
story flew among the business acquaintances of the merchant,&#xD;
and he was ruined. When he retured,-he did not know what&#xD;
had hurt him,'for few like to tell a supposed madman that they&#xD;
are aware of his having been in a mad-house.&#xD;
This bad man, as bold as he was wicked, had, as our readers&#xD;
will remember, formed an early intimacy with most of those&#xD;
who were connected with the firm of Granville and Nordheim.&#xD;
He knew Marion Monek, but that young man had cut his ac.&#xD;
quaintance- after the shirt story' affair.  But O'Doemall was&#xD;
not one to be easily cut, and, no insult could prevent his recog-&#xD;
nizing one he had once known.&#xD;
He ascertained that Marion was sick and confined to his&#xD;
root in Nassau street where Mr. Bennett lodged ; he called,&#xD;
was admitted, and presented himself in Mlarion's room, where&#xD;
he was lying upon a sick mar ' bed..&#xD;

Marion replied that he was glad to see him. So he was, and&#xD;
so he would have been to have seen any one who could relieve-&#xD;
and passaway the weary sick hours. O'Doemall continued to&#xD;
be a frequent visitor at the sick room.  Once or twice he&#xD;
watched all night.  Other friends called--Colonel Mae Neil&#xD;
was among the number, and when he learned that O'Doemall&#xD;
had been so kind, even he was disposed to overlook his owing&#xD;
him money, and renewed' the acquaintance.&#xD;
No one knew the extent of O'Doemall's rascality,. All be*&#xD;
lieved him a bad fellow, but'perhaps not worse than many othI&#xD;
ers : and' when he himself related some of" his most -villanous-&#xD;
storie , his hearers had the charity to believe he 'was lying,&#xD;

THE passage of the ship that conveyed Miss Benson to&#xD;
Charleston was a remarkably short and pleasant one.. To say&#xD;
that the fair traveller did not undergo the usual tax of sea-&#xD;
sickness, would be untrue. She suffered greatly, but her stern&#xD;
and determined purpose kept up her spirits, and when she&#xD;
reached port, she was redy to go' on shore the moment the&#xD;
vessel in which she had been a passenger reached the dock or&#xD;
wharf. She was astonished at her own coolness and courage,&#xD;
for she was not aware that she possessed these qualities. Her&#xD;
baggage was easily carried, and she hired one of the sailors to&#xD;
carry her carpet bag, and to conduct her to the Planters' Hotel.&#xD;
As soon as she 'found herself settled, she sent for the landlord&#xD;
and begged him to ascertain whether Mrs. Gaillard was in&#xD;
town, and if not, whether she was 'at one, of her plantations,&#xD;
and which one. 'The answer was favorable. Mrs. -Gaill*erd&#xD;

it proceeded to the town residence of the mother of her lover.&#xD;
Her visit occasioned some surprise ; but when she stated&#xD;
her parentage, the circumstances under which she left New&#xD;
York, her attachment to young Gaillard, and at ast 'informed&#xD;
her of the deep wrong her son had done her, and that she was&#xD;
soon to become a mother, and that her long journey had been&#xD;
undertaken in order to save the honor of her unborn child-&#xD;
his child,.all the good in that mother's nature was thoroughly&#xD;
roused. She placed her in a room-sent to the hotel, paid the&#xD;
bill, and had the carpet bag brought to her own house.*&#xD;
"II believe all that you have stated-every word of it. My&#xD;
son, shall'do you justice, and that too/fimmediately, or I am no&#xD;
longer his mother. We will start fop the plantation this very&#xD;
afternoon. Frank is sick, and I feel alarmed about him. Now&#xD;
lie down, and make yourselfrperfectly at ease. You require&#xD;
rest and quiet, and I will soon send m'y daughter fo you," said&#xD;
the mother.&#xD;
Miss Benson was overcome, and she flung herself upon her&#xD;
knees bf the bedside, and poured forth sincere thanks to God&#xD;
for his kindness and care. Then she laid down-upon the bed,&#xD;
and soon fell asleep.&#xD;
In the mean time, Mrs. Gaillard had informed her daughter&#xD;
who the visitor was, and her purpose in coming to Qharleston.&#xD;
The young lady was prepared toyreceive her as a sister.&#xD;
"What a cruel wrong Frank'has done to her! 0 mother,&#xD;
who could have thought, that. my brother would have been&#xD;
guilty of. such an infamous thing?  I never will forgive him&#xD;
until he makes wrong right, b.y marrying this sweet girl. Will&#xD;
he do it, Mamma, deur, do you think ?"&#xD;
There was a stern contraction of the haughty brow of that&#xD;
stately mother, and a quivering of the lips, as she replied,&#xD;
" He will, darling, or "-  but the threat remained un-&#xD;
spoken, and she continued. -"Go, my child, to the apartment&#xD;
of Miss Benson.. If she is asleep do not wake her to misery.&#xD;
Remain by her bedside, and comfort her when she awakes."&#xD;
The Southern beauty did as her mother directed, and when&#xD;
Margaret Benson woie from a short sleep, and exclaimed&#xD;
"Where am I'" her hands were seized by the affectionate&#xD;
Miss Gaillard, and she pressed her lips,.as she exclaimed,&#xD;
"With those who will love you for your own sake and who&#xD;
will try and make~that naughty brother of mine give you a legal&#xD;

dince of Mrs. Gaillard, that lady, her daughter, and the 'New&#xD;
York arrival were packed in a-travelling carriage and on their&#xD;
way to the plantation. They arrived about the middle of the&#xD;
afternoon, and as the carriage turned off from the State road&#xD;
into a long avenue, each side of which was ornaineiuted bhy a&#xD;
row of stately live oaks, Miss Benson almost fainted . Ho&#xD;
was. she to be received by her lover? At last, the -arriage&#xD;
drove up in front of the old stone mansion. Troops of negroes&#xD;
of all sizes and ages poured out to meet "Ole Missus."&#xD;
" Where is your master, Tommy ?" demanded Mrs.:Gaillard&#xD;
of an aged gray-headed negro.&#xD;
"Massa Frank gone down to de creek fishin'," was the reply.&#xD;
"That is all. I am very glad of that," said Mrs. Gaillard,&#xD;
addressing those in the -carriage. "I shall have time to con-&#xD;
verse with him before he is aware of the arrival of Miss' Ben-&#xD;
son."&#xD;
The occupants f the carriage entered the mansion, and Miss&#xD;
Benson was speedily shown to a room. Miss Gaillard' 'accoma&#xD;
panied her thither, and' as she assisted her to change her&#xD;
dress, she endeavored to soothe the agitation of the stranger,&#xD;
and to give her every encouragement.&#xD;
"You must not leave your room, dear Miss Margaret, until&#xD;
Mamma has had a serious talk with our gay' deceiver of a bro-&#xD;
ther. I have never seen Mamma so decided- and so angry,"&#xD;
said Miss Gaillard.&#xD;
0, 1 hope, dear Miss Gaillard, that my arrival will not be&#xD;
the means of causing discord in your peaceful family. If I&#xD;
thought so, I should -wish I had never left New York," repled&#xD;
Miss Benson.&#xD;
"Give yourself no uneasiness. If there is a storm it will&#xD;
soon be over, and a ,clear sky will follow. I pray God that my&#xD;
brother will be convinced by Mamina of the necessity of doing&#xD;
what is right in this unhappy affair," replied Miss Gaillard.&#xD;
" Amen," was all the reply that Miss Benson could make.&#xD;
A few moments only elapsed, when Mr. Francis Gaillard&#xD;
was seen coming up the long avenue through which the car-&#xD;
riage had just passed. He was extremely pale, walked very&#xD;
slow, and had every appearance of suffering from 'severe ill-&#xD;
ness. His mother went out upon the piazza, and when he en-&#xD;
tered, cordially embraced him.&#xD;
"Are you better, my son ?"&#xD;

Young Gaillard followed his mother, and, they were alone.&#xD;
Mrs. Gaillard spoke.&#xD;
"Francisi. will you come and sit down by me 1"&#xD;
He complied.&#xD;
"Now inform me, my son, of every fact connected with your,&#xD;

sence 'of your God. But for, her attachment to you, was this&#xD;
young lady a virtuous girl ?"&#xD;
" Asthe fallen snow. I only led her into sin," was the.&#xD;
honest ieply.&#xD;
" Are her parents of respectability ?" asked the mother.&#xD;
"'Unquestioned. Equal to my parents in every regard,"&#xD;
replied the son.&#xD;
" Then how could you be so base as to ruin her ?"&#xD;
"I, Mother l .But why should I deceive you, Mother? I&#xD;
have acted like a r    -scal. How you came to know'anything&#xD;
about the matter I will not stop to ask. I feel the deepest&#xD;
remorse ia reference to that young lady. If ever woman loved&#xD;
man, she loved me," was the truthful reply of the son.&#xD;
' "And yet you could deliberately' abandon her in the, deli-&#xD;
cate situation to which you had brought her ?"&#xD;
":L my motherT. What do, you mean ?" he asked.&#xD;
"She is shortly to become a mother-a mother to your child?&#xD;
0. Frank, Frank !" said the mother.&#xD;
" Mother, L will return to New York, and do her full justice.&#xD;
I will marry her, if she will consent to marry such a wretch&#xD;
as me," said Fr-ancis. '&#xD;
.,,My sQn, she is here-in this house. She has alone fol-&#xD;
loved; you'on from Ne w York, for the sake of -her child."&#xD;
" Not a word more, mother. I. will see her at once ;" and&#xD;
before Mrs. Gaillard could arrest his speech, Francis Gaillard4&#xD;
found his way to the apartment of Miss Benson. - The meeting&#xD;
between the two young persons was affecting in the highest&#xD;
'degree. Poor Margaret, when she listened to the first bursts&#xD;
'of repentant words freu Frank, was Qverwhelmed with happi*&#xD;
ness., It was long ere she could find words to reply to his&#xD;
&#xD;
£&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

&#xD;
extravagant fondness. "Thank God that you' had' the nerve&#xD;
to come South, dear Margaret! You shall not 'regret it. I&#xD;
will marry you without any delay, and at least -the little one&#xD;
promised to us shall make its advent under more auspicious&#xD;
circumstances than I deserve. Cheer up ! I go'to ho-l4 oun-&#xD;
sel with my good-hearted old mother," exclaimed the lover.&#xD;
Frank Gaillard went to the mother, and told her allklia plans.&#xD;
She listened quietly, and finally replied,&#xD;
" My son, I am rejoiced at discovering a disposition on.your&#xD;
part to repair the wrong that you have committed against the&#xD;
peace of a young lady of such respectability; bu-t- the -matter&#xD;
must be settled quietly, and without any noise. I can arrange&#xD;
yoar marriage so that no question will ever be raised in regard&#xD;
to the' legitimacy of your, child."&#xD;
The old lady sent a note -to Dr. Wallace, the rector of the&#xD;
Episcopal Church, within a few miles of their residence. The&#xD;
ceremony of the marriage was performed that evening. A&#xD;
certificate of the marriage was given, and a corresponding en-&#xD;
try made in the record book of the Parish Church. What mat-&#xD;
tered that it was dated six months earlier than the day when&#xD;
the marriage rites were celebrated? -It ought to have,, been'&#xD;
celebrated six months earlier, and who should ever study for&#xD;
proof to the contrary?  The good doctor believed he was do-&#xD;
ing right, and whep asked for a duplicate certificate, he- wil-&#xD;
lingly gave it.&#xD;
This duplicate Francis Gaillard intended to send to Colouel&#xD;
Benson with an explanatory letter, bat he delayed writing it&#xD;
until he himself should-go to Charleston.,, Meanwhile, the fair&#xD;
Miss Benson was presented to all as. Mrs. Francis . Gaillard.&#xD;
The marriage was kept a profound secret; no oie of the 'du'&#xD;
mestics dreamed of such a thing. The only witnesses to the&#xD;
ceremony were the mother and the sister.&#xD;
Before a week elapsed, the family was' startled by another&#xD;
arrival. They were just sitting down to dinner when a  ar-&#xD;
riage drove up the Live Oak Avenue. It contained Colonel&#xD;
Benson. He sprang out of the carriage, and had reached the&#xD;
top of the steps leading 'to the mansion, when his daughter&#xD;
flung herselfinto his arms.&#xD;
"Oh, dear Papa, how glad -I am to see you, and so will my&#xD;
husband be."&#xD;
"Husband !" and he held her at arm's length while he re-&#xD;
peated that single word " Husband !"&#xD;
" Yes, dear Papa. Husband ; 'for Mr. Gaillard is my' hus-&#xD;

band, and I will tell you all about it Papa, but not now. Here&#xD;
is Frank."&#xD;
Mr. Gaillard offered his hand to Colonel Benson. It wa's&#xD;
barely touched by the latter.&#xD;
"uWhen I hear all, perhaps I shall be more cordial," he ob-&#xD;
served, coldly.&#xD;
He followed his daughter and her husband, and then was in.m&#xD;
produced to Madame Gaillard. If the latter was pleased at'&#xD;
rneeting the stately and gentlemanly .father of her daughter-in.&#xD;
law, the Colonel was no less pleased with the magnificent old&#xD;
lady, tle mother of his daughter's husband.&#xD;
"You have arrived just in time for dinner, Colonel Benson.&#xD;
I need not add how welcome you are;" she observed.&#xD;
"Many thanks, dear madam, but I am afraid that my pres-&#xD;
ence here has occasioned you some surprise. I confess that 1&#xD;
arrived here-with far different purposes than to eat a friendly&#xD;
dinner,"said Colonel Benson.&#xD;
"No one could be more welcome than the father of my son's&#xD;
wife. I hope we shall be able to make your visit a most&#xD;
agreeable one," said Mr. Gaillard.         .&#xD;
"The first words spoken by my child have relieved my mind&#xD;
of a load of agony and anxiety," replied the Colonel.&#xD;
An excellent dinner wos partaken of, and, when it was -fin-&#xD;
ished Madame Gaillard advised the young couple to go -and&#xD;
walk. Then she dismissed the servants in attendance. When,&#xD;
she was alone with the Colonel, she deliberately requested him&#xD;
to listen to her explanations. She informed him of the arrival&#xD;
of his daughter in Charleston, and her surprise and anxiety of&#xD;
her bringing his daughter home and the marriage. When she"&#xD;
spoke of the maternal situation of his daughter, the Colonel was&#xD;
dumbfounded. Then she told him of the delicate manner in&#xD;
which the marriage had been managed. and handed him the&#xD;
inarriage certificate.&#xD;
"It, will probably be some two or three months before my&#xD;
daughter-in-law's confinement. Then if God wills that no acci-&#xD;
dent happens, there never.can arise cavil or flaw in the. pro-&#xD;
ceedings. Bea- in mind, Colonel Benson, that we had to&#xD;
make a wrong right, and out of evil to get good. I, too, am&#xD;
nore interested in having our large possessions go to an un-&#xD;
questioned legal descendant, than you possibly can be. Now,&#xD;
are you satisfied ?"&#xD;
"Madam, I have no words to express my gratitude. -If I&#xD;
had a hundred lives, they -should all be yours. You have in'&#xD;
&#xD;
deed acted nobly, generously, and how can I repay it?" said&#xD;
Colonel Benson, warmly.&#xD;
"Sinmply, Colonel, by treating _your son-in-law and your&#xD;
daughter as though nothing irregular had happened-make no&#xD;
allusion to it.,- The pai-sh record and the marriage certificate,&#xD;
and the entry of the birth of the first born child will tell all the&#xD;
story in future times, should it ever need to be told. Intro-&#xD;
duce the bride as an old married lady, or at least as ,haVing&#xD;
been married so many months ago .as to have ceased being a&#xD;
novelty' to talk about,; and the world, that is so fond of scandal,&#xD;
need have nothing to say. We have only to keep our own&#xD;
counsel. The members of my family will keep theirs. When&#xD;
you get to New York, an equally prudent course on your part&#xD;
will be productive of equally happy results," replied Madame&#xD;
Gaillard.&#xD;
"You'are a lady of a thousand. I .agreewith every word&#xD;
you have uttered. As soon as I reach New York, I will give&#xD;
out that your son was privately married to my daughter before&#xD;
her family knew any thing about it, and that the young lady&#xD;
followed her husband to the South, where she now is."&#xD;
" And where, Colonel Benson, she-must remain for one or&#xD;
two years. I say this for the sake of the child that I hope will&#xD;
proVe a grandson, and be a blessing to my old age. . When the&#xD;
babe, reaches a few months old, then my daughter-in-law can&#xD;
visit the North with safety, so far as important questions are&#xD;
concerned."&#xD;
"Again you are right, lady," observed Colonel Benson.&#xD;
"And I must add that few parents will enjoy a sounder and&#xD;
more refreshing sleep than I shall to-night.  My mind is com-&#xD;
pletely at ease. I have been extremely worried for many&#xD;
days."&#xD;
I can readily understand that, sir, but you will have no&#xD;
further cause. of embarrassment. My son is rich, and Margar6t&#xD;
has made a good match, so far as wealth is concerned. My&#xD;
son has been wild, but I hope that will pass away, and that he&#xD;
will be a good, kind husband. I regret to say that his health&#xD;
is far from good since his return from the North, and there are&#xD;
moments when my fears get the better of me. We must hope&#xD;
for the best," said the mother.&#xD;
This was news to Colonel Benson, but when he Closely exam-&#xD;
ined the countenance -of his son-in-law, and contrasted, his&#xD;
present feeble appearance with what he had know him in-,New&#xD;
York, he, too, partook of the alarm, and suggested to the .elder&#xD;

character be resorted.to at once. Colonel .Benson wrote 'that&#xD;
evening to his wife in New York. He simply informed her&#xD;
that he was well, and that Magaret had been secretly, married&#xD;
to Mr. Gaillard, and:that she was quite an old married .dame&#xD;
when he reached her. He' cautioned his wife against saying&#xD;
much about the matter until his return to New York. After&#xD;
despatching this, the Colonel felt completely happy, and gaVt&#xD;
himself up fully to his enjoyment. IHe fished, hunted, and rode&#xD;
about theneighborhood, making the acquaintance of the princi.&#xD;
pal planters in that vicinity. After a fortnight spent in this&#xD;
manner, he. could not be contented to remain longer, bat took&#xD;
his departure for Charleston, and from thence sailed for New&#xD;

'After the departure of her father, the ydung wife devoted&#xD;
herself to her husband. His health failed daily, but still, he&#xD;

IT would seem almost an impossibility for Marion Monck to&#xD;
be on the same floor with the editor of the Herald, and in the&#xD;
habit of meeting and conversing with him every day, without&#xD;
imbibing a certain quantity of the spirit that ;animated the&#xD;
editor in a new era in journalism&#xD;
On one occasion he had been traversing an upper street of&#xD;
the city-when he fourad himself in the midst of a riot, lHe saw&#xD;
.the~ whole of it. A man was killed. Mlarion' went home, and,&#xD;

&#xD;
as it was a matter of news of some moment,. he: went intoTMr -&#xD;
Bennett's room and narrated the whole of it to himi " Excel.&#xD;
lent," said the editor. " I am  really much obliged to you,&#xD;
Add to the. favor by writing down what you have already told&#xD;
me, and I will publish it in the morning's issue. It will make&#xD;
a capital article, and you have related it in excellent style."&#xD;
Marion.took a pen, and after some hesitation wrote an account&#xD;
of the affair. Mr. Bennett read it and then exclaimed, "Bahb,&#xD;
what trash!"&#xD;
"Why, what is the matter with it, Mr. Bennett".&#xD;
"The matter is that you have ,not written it at all as you&#xD;
told it., You have attempted to improve upon it, and bungled&#xD;
it all up. You have got the Cart before the horse. As .you&#xD;
related it to me -it was excellent. This writing of yours- is&#xD;
nonsense. I shall have to write it all over again from my own&#xD;
recollection of what you have told ,me,. in order to make a&#xD;
readable article. There is not one person, in -ive hundred, of&#xD;
those who claim to be editors or writers, that can write  a&#xD;
editorial as it should be written. An editorial, Master Marion.&#xD;
should have a beginning, a middle, and an:end. An editorial&#xD;
should have an object-a point. If a man happened to fall&#xD;
into a sink because there .was no cover' to it, and aneditor&#xD;
wanted to call the attention of the authorities to the' neglect.,&#xD;
and consequent injury, the occurrence of the man' falling should&#xD;
be related plainly, and as it occurred,; then state the danger to&#xD;
others from this neglect ; and lastly, point o1it the way to mend&#xD;
all further accidents by covering the hole up with a stone or a&#xD;
piece of marble or an iron top. It is a common simile, but it&#xD;
answers as well as a better one. You write what a shame it is&#xD;
that rows are allowed to occur, and then tell that a row has&#xD;
occurred, and a man has been killed. -But don't* get discour-&#xD;
aged ; you may not think so, but one day youwill be able to&#xD;
write a clever editorial, which is the highest style of composition&#xD;
known," said Mr. Bennett, encouragingly.&#xD;
'Such conversations frequently occurred between the editor&#xD;
and Marion M6nck. Bat such was the low estimate that Marion&#xD;
had at that time of the destiny of the Herald, that. though he&#xD;
had not a cent, if Mr. Bennett had offered him an equal part.&#xD;
nership, .he would Ihave declined the offer. Marion, however,&#xD;
did not underrate the ability of the '-editor. He discovered&#xD;
then, that clear-headed ability, that careful, thought, vivid&#xD;
imagination and ready wit which has since been deveJlped, bue&#xD;
which great body of his readers have never given~ Mr. Bepnett:&#xD;
credit for.; He' possessed a winig way with young' pedplee&#xD;

and had'a happy faculty of drawing them  out. Marion was&#xD;
somewhat susceptible in love matters. He had not suffered&#xD;
quite enough with the affair of Miss Isabella Granville, but&#xD;
some months after became violently in love with a rich bank-&#xD;
er's daughter. The name of the father was Jones. Marion got&#xD;
introduced to her, and accompanied her to church on' one or&#xD;
two occasions. The father was- excessively pious, and so was&#xD;
the daughter. The old Jones abominated theatres, and con-&#xD;
sidered a Sabbath-breaker as out of the pale of any sort of sal-&#xD;
vation. Marion was on the free list of almost every theatre,&#xD;
and was cheek by jowl with every actor and actress qf any note&#xD;
upon the New York boards. In regard to the Sabbath, after&#xD;
the acquaintance commenced with Miss Euphenia Jones, he&#xD;
was very regular in his attendance at the same ,church where&#xD;
she worshipped. Unfortunately, on one occasion three young&#xD;
gentlemen persuaded hini"to accompany them in a White Hall&#xD;
boat to a place in the lower bay. It was Sunday. All went&#xD;
on very well -until they attempted to return to the city in the&#xD;
afternoon. The wind came out from the north-west, and blew&#xD;
a stiff breeze. It was night before they beat up to within some'&#xD;
distance of the Narrows. The tide was-at ebb. A sudden flow&#xD;
of wind capsized their frail boat, and they were all immersed&#xD;
into the water. All succeeded-in 'gettingupon the keel of the&#xD;
boat, an4their united weights sunk down the boat so low that&#xD;
the water nearly.reached the neoks of these young men. Upon&#xD;
comparing notes it was found that batone could swim. That&#xD;
one was Marion. They were a mile or two from the shore, and&#xD;
floating out rapidly to sea.. There was but little chance of be-&#xD;
ing picked up by- inward bound vessels, for -the wind was&#xD;
ahead, and all such, of course, would come, to an anchor. Un-&#xD;
der these appalling circumstances, Marion, with great gal-&#xD;
lantry, offered to swim ashore and get aid. One of the young&#xD;
men was an acquaintance of Marion's new flame. His name'&#xD;
was Robert Knight, and his uncle was governor- of the little&#xD;
State of Rhode ,Island. Marion stripped off every rag of&#xD;
clothes, and after he had bade all good-bye, he sai4. to young&#xD;
'Kight, "Bob, dear Bob, should I be drowned, remember me,&#xD;
for God's sake; to Pheeney Jones."&#xD;
,,After a terrible time, Marion succeeded in teaching the&#xD;
Long Island shore. He ran up directly to a private residence&#xD;
situated high upon the shore. He forgot his nude state, and&#xD;
rushed iinto the parlor, whore the family were congregated, and&#xD;
among them a number of young ladies - Their -screams were&#xD;
fearful, but nothing daunted, Marion seized a candle-stick and&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
'4&#xD;
&#xD;
281&#xD;
&#xD;
rushed back to the shore.' He had toldhisstory, and luckily&#xD;
a negro overheard and understood it. He asked Marion for&#xD;
particulars, and without a word went down to a boat belonging&#xD;
to the house, and rowed off to rescue the sufferers. He was&#xD;
just in time, and he succeeded in getting all into the boat,&#xD;
bringing them ashore and conveying them to his own humble&#xD;
cottage. Then commenced a search for Marion. They found&#xD;
him senseless at the foot of a cliff, with the candle and candle-&#xD;
stick beside him. He had fallen through a tree which grew at&#xD;
the foot of the rock, and this had-saved his life. The negro&#xD;
furnished the party with old clothes, and at midight they left&#xD;
him and walked to New York. It was near daylight when&#xD;
they crossed the Fulton ferry. That day three, of the party&#xD;
took a carriage and went down to the spot. They found the&#xD;
negro, and made him a present of a hundred dollars in silver.&#xD;
Marion contributed his share, but he was too ill to go with his&#xD;
companions. He lay upon his bed, and a medical man was&#xD;
called in. The affair got wind, and the afternoon papers, of&#xD;
that day had a long article upon the matter. They gave credit&#xD;
to Marion for his gallantry in-saving te lives of his. compan-&#xD;
ions,iut one of the Journals, the "Commerpial Advertiser,"&#xD;
stated that 1t was "Sunday," and that God would have acted&#xD;
perfectly right if he had drowned the whole party. That even-&#xD;
'ing Mr. Bennett called in to see his sick friend Marion, and&#xD;
he, too, congratulated him upon the gallant act;&#xD;
"Curse that commercial newspaper. They take that paper.&#xD;
Sunday. My cake is all dough now," exclaimed Marion, very&#xD;
petulantly.&#xD;
"What is the inatter ? Tell .me all about it. I' will put it&#xD;
straight in my paper in the morning: Let me have all the&#xD;
facts," said the editor.&#xD;
Marion narrated them, andadded, "Of course it was' very&#xD;
natural, that with a good show for being drowned, I sent a&#xD;
message by Bob, in case' he got picked up, to Miss Jones."&#xD;
"She ought to be obliged to you, very much' so," said the&#xD;
editor.,&#xD;
The next morning Marion sent out. early to get a Herald.&#xD;
When he opened it, there was the article headed "Narrow Es-&#xD;
cape 'from Drowning. Gallant Behavior of Marion Monek."&#xD;
Marion read on-all' pleasant!-.praised him up-told the whole&#xD;
thing pretty fairly, but all at once -his face- became a foand a&#xD;
half long, and he rushed into Mr. Bennett's room.&#xD;
" Why, what is the matter 'i" exclaimned the editor.&#xD;

and he read, " Bob, dear Bob, should I be drowned, remember&#xD;
me, for God's sake, to.Pheeney Jones.' That is my death-war-&#xD;

"But Marion, you don't mean to say that Jones, Pheeney&#xD;
Jones,is the realname of your flame ?"&#xD;
"Of course it is. Old Jones the banker's. daughter. One&#xD;
of the vestry of Trinity Church. Sunday, too! You also say&#xD;
that I was 'engaged and shortly to be married to that young&#xD;
female to whom he sent a dying message.' It is no such thing.&#xD;
O, it will play Ned with me !"&#xD;
"1On the contrary, my dear boy, you are not responsible for&#xD;
what appears in the Herald.  You don't say that you were&#xD;
engaged, it is theHerald that says so. Throw the blame upon&#xD;
the IHerald. As for Miss Jones, I will print another edition,&#xD;

though I think she ought to be extremely flattered that a tal-&#xD;
ented gllolw, a gallant chap like you should think of her, when^&#xD;
he expects to bedrowned-shortly, eh? Look at it in that way."&#xD;
0, that is all very fine, Mr. Bennett, to talk. No matter&#xD;
what she thinks.. If itlhad been any other day than Supday,&#xD;
it would have been all right. But her father-Jehyi! Sunday,&#xD;
eh !  'll go up to the house of Mr. Jones this evening, and&#xD;
know the Worst."&#xD;
Eveningcame, and Marion-did.as he stated he would do.'&#xD;
He went around to Ann street to the Herald office. When he&#xD;
saw Mr. Bennett, the latter observed,&#xD;
"Well, Marion, what success ?"-&#xD;
"I could not get in. The servant, a grinning negro, handed&#xD;
me this note. Just read it."&#xD;

"Of course you will publish it. Give him as good as he&#xD;

claimed Mr. Bennett, reaching out his hand for the note.&#xD;
"0O Lord, no! I could not think of such a thing. . It would&#xD;
ruin me with the girl."&#xD;
" You have nothing more to hope for in that quarter, if you&#xD;

you don't choose to take my advice, you are no worse off for&#xD;

It was in those days actually considered a horrible matter to&#xD;
get into-a newspaper. Marion so regarded it. Not so Mr.&#xD;
Bennett. He regarded those matters which became talked of&#xD;
among a set or circle, as legitimate articles for a newspaper.&#xD;
So they were; and now, that the ice is broken, half the people&#xD;

"That, wife,. is precisely what I am  coming at.  But it&#xD;

siderable amount and invest it in securities in my own name.&#xD;
I think there will be a crash in the commercial vorld before&#xD;
long, but by submitting to some extortion I think I can get&#xD;
out of the concern now, with- the capital which you placed in&#xD;
it and about half as much more as I am entitled to for my&#xD;
share of the profits.  I can also make Granville cancel or so&#xD;
cure me for all outstanding liabilities," observed the prudent&#xD;
Wilson.&#xD;
"Then, my dear, do so as speedily as possible.  I am  a&#xD;
great reliever in luck, and there is none where Mr. Granville&#xD;
is concerned," said the wife.&#xD;
In pursuance of this understanding between the husband&#xD;
and wife, Mr. Wilson proposed to M Ir. Granville a dissolution.&#xD;
He made it in such a way, and it appeared so much to the ad.&#xD;
vantage of Mr.. Granville, that he instantly acceded to it-and&#xD;
thanks to the goed financial management of Mr. Wilson, the&#xD;
firm ;er in a situation to give him back in cash all that. he&#xD;
had put in, and twenty-five thousand dollars for his share of the&#xD;
p fits.&#xD;
Granville knew that the apparent profits were four times&#xD;
that amount. Mr. Wilson calculated that the 'losses for the&#xD;
nekt year, under more unfavorable circumstances, would eat&#xD;
up all the profits. Mr. Granville also was able to give securi-&#xD;
ty for the outstanding liabilities of the concern, and Mr. Wil-.&#xD;
son signed the dissolution, giving the closing up of the affairs&#xD;
to Mr. Granville.&#xD;
Thirty days made Mr. Wilson free from all further resnon-&#xD;
sibilities, and he retired on his laurels, and devoted his whole&#xD;
time to the wife and child. The cash that he received he in-&#xD;
vested in real estate,-and placed it in the name of his wife.&#xD;
She was a woman who could appreciate a delicacy like this,&#xD;
but she made no comment upon it.&#xD;
From the very day that Mr. Wilson withdrew from the con-&#xD;
cern it seemed as though the prosperity of Mr. Granville de.&#xD;
clined. He met all his liabilities and engagements promptly,&#xD;
both for the old house and the new, and every month Mr. Wil-&#xD;
son re-transferred to his old partner stocks and other securi-&#xD;
ties.&#xD;
Then a commercial crisis followed. Mrt Granville seemed&#xD;
to lose money by every operation.  He had done a very heavy&#xD;
commission business, and held a large amount of business pa-&#xD;
per, a large portion of which was protested as it become due.&#xD;
UHis losses were tremendous, but he bore up stoutly under&#xD;
them ; and although he lived higher, drank a great deal more -&#xD;

than usual, and relaxed much in his strict business habits, yet&#xD;
he appeared to hold his own, and his commercial credit stood&#xD;
unimpaired, although it had a terrible shaking. He felt that&#xD;
he had consented to a dissolution too hastily. But he kept a&#xD;
brave heart, and was not a man to be moved by trifles. He&#xD;
became a grandfather too of a fine boy about the ilme that Mr..&#xD;
Wilson had a son.  This son of his daughter Isabel was a new&#xD;
source of pride to the old merchant.&#xD;
He regretted that the grandson was not Walter's child, so&#xD;
that it could bear his own honored name of Granville. Then&#xD;
the proud father wondered what had become of his son-.whe-&#xD;
ther he was dead, or would ever turn up:again. His wonder-&#xD;
ment was destined to be solved, but in a manner- that was al-&#xD;
most a deathblow to the aristocratic parent. . The events that&#xD;
led to this discovery we will narrate as briefly as possible.&#xD;
It was at a late hour one Saturday night that two young men&#xD;
applied for admittance to a celebrated house of ill-fape .in.&#xD;
Ch'ureh street. In the centre of the door were some iron blindas&#xD;
about the size of an ordinary window glass.  Through these&#xD;
blinds the pei'son who came to the inside surveyed the appli-&#xD;
cants for admission.&#xD;
Who do you wish to see ?" was the query of the female&#xD;
doorkeeper.&#xD;
"Some of the young ladies," was the'reply, in a manly tone&#xD;
of voice.&#xD;
" Are you acquainted with any of tiem ?" was asked.&#xD;
No, madam, we are strangers ; we know no one .in the&#xD;
house, and have justarrived," was the reply.&#xD;
"You are not rowdies anyhow, and I will let you in."&#xD;
The parties entered, and the door was again closed, locked,&#xD;
bolted, and securely chained, as is the ordinary but prudent&#xD;
custom of such houses.&#xD;
The girl took a good look at the two persons she admitted.&#xD;
They were both draped in the garb of the better class of sail-&#xD;
ors, yet they appeared to be gentlemen.  Probably they had&#xD;
disguised themselves in thismanner for a lark, thought the&#xD;
girl.-.and her survey being satisfactory, she observed,&#xD;
"Both of the parlors are occupied. I shall be obliged to&#xD;
show you into Miss Clara's parlor, and then I will send some&#xD;
of the young ladies into you."&#xD;
"Thank you," replied one of the persons. He was much&#xD;
stouter than his companion, who addressed him as " Walt."&#xD;
His countenance was ~large and open ; his teeth whernlie&#xD;
laughed weIfe exposed, and white as ivory. His laugh was&#xD;

merry nd Iearty, and the smile which accompanied it would,&#xD;
have'won uny' woman's heart. He appeared to have been a&#xD;
sailor. His faceawas bronzed, evidently, from exposure, and&#xD;
his!dark hair*hich hung long about his face, appeared not to&#xD;
have been cut-in along while.. He was. very stoutly built,&#xD;
broad across theshoulders and chest, and he looked like A&#xD;
youth that it *ould not be safe to trifle with. The younger of&#xD;
the two was called Harry Robinson; he was not so stout as&#xD;
his companion, but evidently was not a common sailor ; his&#xD;
laxiguage was equally correct as his friend Walter.&#xD;
The girl conducted the new comers into a small but exquis-&#xD;
itely furnished parlor. There was a piano in it, and also a&#xD;
guitar. Several choice paintings adorned the, walls, and an&#xD;
elegant sofa was -in.one corner; there was a door which opened&#xD;
to a room in the rear.  Harry, as he was called, tried to open&#xD;
it, to see where it led to; it was fast.  Both persons took off&#xD;
their hats; placed them upon the centre table near a superb&#xD;
astral, when they entered the\ room.&#xD;
.    The guitar seemed to attract the attention of the one called&#xD;
"IWalt;"&#xD;
He took it up and struck a few notes.&#xD;
"The best guitar I have touched,,in.a long while--I wonder&#xD;
.  who plays.it," he asked as the girl who opened the .door to ad-&#xD;
mit them entered the room.&#xD;
"That belongs to Miss Clara," replied the girl.&#xD;
"Shall we have the pleasure of seeing Miss Clara ?" asked&#xD;
Walter.,&#xD;
WaNo, sir, Miss Clara does noi see company. She has this&#xD;
parlor and the sleeping"room, attached, and is a private board-&#xD;
er," said the girl.&#xD;
Walter had commenced playing- while the girl was talking&#xD;
,-and when she had finished he sung a.Spanish love song, ac-&#xD;
companied by the guitar.&#xD;
The girl stopped and listened. - Walter finished, and then&#xD;
ordered a bottle of champagne, adding,'&#xD;
Where is this Miss Clara, into whose parlor we have&#xD;
been intruding ?"&#xD;
The girl replied that Miss Clara was in one of the main par-&#xD;
lo-s, amusing herself.&#xD;
She was interrupted by a sweet musical voice-&#xD;
" Miss Clara is here to speak for herself, and to ask who is&#xD;
playing her gitar with such unusual good taste,' and at the&#xD;
ame time one of the most beautiful visions burst into the par-&#xD;
loer that Walter had seen in many months. Her -long auburn&#xD;
&#xD;
'7&#xD;
'4&#xD;
I&#xD;
I&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
tresses fell in ringlets that reached behind her Waist. She&#xD;
w'as dressed in white, and not a single ornament of jewelry&#xD;
was about her. Her face was beautiful, and -her figure, per-&#xD;
feet. Both of the young men arose and uttered exclamations&#xD;
of delight. She noticed but one. of them.  From the moment&#xD;
she entered the room her gaze was fixed upon Walter.&#xD;
"Fair lady," he observed, "we owe you an-'apology for thus&#xD;
intruding into your apartments,.and I for touching this pri.&#xD;
vate property-but the girl is to blame for showing as in here,&#xD;
and I must apologize for touching the guitar," observed Wal-&#xD;
ter respectfully.'&#xD;
The lady gazed at him, but for some moments did not reply&#xD;
a word, but took a seat on the sofa- Walter then resumed his&#xD;
seat, and she took his hand, and still continued to examine his&#xD;
features. At last she appeared to be satisfied with her close&#xD;
examination, and a peculiar smile played-for a moment, upon&#xD;
her fascinating mouth.&#xD;
Miss Clara, I hope you will know me again when_ you see&#xD;
me," said Walter.&#xD;
"I know you now, if I am not mistaken," said Clara.&#xD;
"Indeed I do not remember having ever had the -pleasure&#xD;
of seeing you before," replied Walter.-' in- fact I have been&#xD;
away from New York some years," he continued.&#xD;
At this moment the girl entered and announced that one of&#xD;
the parlors was empty, and that Miss Brown wished the party&#xD;
to adjourn to the principal parlor.&#xD;
 " I have taken the wine there," said the girl.&#xD;
That is perfectly;right," Olara replied. "Show that 'gen-&#xD;
tleman (pointing to Harry) into the parlor. I will follow with&#xD;
one who plays the guitar. I want to ask him one or two qupes-&#xD;
tionw. Go' atonce."&#xD;
The' girl left the room with the young man, and as soon as&#xD;
they were gone and she was alone with Walter, shelookedthe&#xD;
door of the parlor, then passed tq the other door; and took a&#xD;
key from the pocket of her dress, and opened it,"&#xD;
"Look in here, Master Sailor," she added.&#xD;
Walter came to her side as slasood in the open door, and&#xD;
there he discovered a sleeping, artment fitted up eqal to&#xD;
any room in a palace. The bed was a lofty one, with ins&#xD;
carved posts, and was one that a king would have been satis-&#xD;
fled with.&#xD;
Walter glanced over the apartment, remarking as he did so,&#xD;
" I have never seen an apartment for sleepizig more exqais&#xD;
itelyifurnished."&#xD;

He looked for a moment at the loveliness by his side, and&#xD;
sighetj.,,&#xD;
-What is that sigh for, and what is your name .&#xD;
AWalter-and I drew a sigh thinking what a happy man he&#xD;
would be who could occupy that apartments and have as a com-&#xD;
panion-its beautiful owner," was the gallant answer.&#xD;
Indeed ! Do you know, Mr. Walter, that I am not oie of&#xD;
the girls belonging to this house ?" asked Clara.&#xD;
I am perfectly aware of it--and don't suppose that f, a&#xD;
poor devil of a sailor just- off from four years' cruising at sea,,&#xD;
had formed any idea that I could have s0o much happiness"&#xD;
said Walter.&#xD;
"Answer me some questions. Yu came here to-night, you&#xD;
and your friend, to see each a young Lady ?"&#xD;
I confess we did," was the reply.&#xD;
"This is a somewhat; expensive establishment-are you&#xD;
aware of it ?" asked Miss Norris.&#xD;
I am ; but we are not without some funds. We were paid&#xD;
off to-day, and what we order we can pay for," said Walter,&#xD;
with some pride.&#xD;
"Now, Master Walter, let me say to you that your friend, or&#xD;
you, if you had a thousand dollars, could not enter these pri-&#xD;
vate apartments of mine, but "-&#xD;
I am aware of it-perfectly aware of it. Let us go tint&#xD;
the parlor," said Walter.&#xD;
"In one moment. Look at me, Walter. We will go into&#xD;
the parlor.- You shall see all the' young ladies in the house-.&#xD;
'some are exquisitely beautiful. If you do not see any that you'&#xD;
can admire or desire for a companion Until to-morrow morning,&#xD;
then, on one condition, I, my poor humble self, will be, your&#xD;
slave. You shall be lord and master of the apartments and&#xD;
my person at your disposal on one condition," and as she said&#xD;
this, she, like a true ,Oriental, flung herself upon her knees,&#xD;
and took' Walter's hand and kissed it reverently.,&#xD;
"Why, I should be the happiest, luckiest dog in existence.&#xD;
But you can't mean it, and what is the condition ?' asked Wal-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
"That the word moiey is not used between us. You shall&#xD;
not even pay for the bottle of wine 'that you have ordered, nor&#xD;
for others that I shall order. You shall go, into the parlor, see&#xD;
all the beauties of. the establish ment--play-sing-dance, and*&#xD;
amuse yourself until you are tired; then, when you whisper&#xD;
'thjatto me, I will leave the room and have you conducted. in&#xD;
here. We will pass the night as pleasantly as we can. We&#xD;
&#xD;

will have a choice breakfast ready in my parlor when we get&#xD;
up, and after you have partaken of that with me, then yon&#xD;
shall go wherever you please ; but the word money-or. pay-...&#xD;
or compensation, is not to be used by you  If you forget your&#xD;
promise, I will leave you in an instant," said Clara Norris.'&#xD;
"Am I awake ? or do I dream ? Lady, I accept1'!the condi.&#xD;
tion," said Walter.&#xD;
Clara flung herself upon his manly breast, and he was not&#xD;
backward in holding her tightly in his powerful embrace, white&#xD;
he feasted upon her soft, dewy lips, He was losing all control&#xD;
of himself, when she, with her face crimsoned with blushes,&#xD;
broke away from him laughing, and as she unlocked and flung&#xD;
open her parlor door, said, "Come,-my lord and master, I cane&#xD;
not permit you to be naughty. You have a long night - before&#xD;
you,- and you must see all the beauties of this house before you'&#xD;
will be able to decide whether you will, accept my offer. Not&#xD;
a word, more."&#xD;
They entered one of the ma'n parlors arm in arm, and Clara&#xD;
crossed the room and presented Master Walter to Mrs. Julia&#xD;
Brown, the proprietor of -the establishment. Walter bowed to&#xD;
a magnificent woman, who was "fair, fat and forty."', He then&#xD;
seated himself, and for a moment was lost in amazement., In&#xD;
different parts of the room were eight or more of the most exr-&#xD;
quisitely beautiful girls he had.ever laid his eyes upon. Some&#xD;
were not over fifteen, or at most seventeen years of age. One&#xD;
was presiding at the piano, -playing a waltz, while two others&#xD;
were waltzing with grace and elegance. All were dressed&#xD;
costly, but with exquisite taste. Walter had read of Turkish&#xD;
harems and voluptuous Circassian and Georgian- beauties, but-&#xD;
hee he fancied that it was realized. The wine was passing&#xD;
freely, and Walter noticed that his friend had made no special&#xD;
acquaintance. He went up and spoke a few words to him.&#xD;
Henry made no reply except "Is is possible ?" and then looked&#xD;
at Clara, who, amid all this galaxy of beauty, was partly re-&#xD;
clining upon the sofa, the most beautiful among tIle beautiful.&#xD;
Her eye met Walter's and it seemed to say, "Are you satisfied&#xD;
that I am peerless here ?"&#xD;
Henry asked Walter a question, and directed his attention&#xD;
to a young and lovely creature that scarcely seemed to be&#xD;
twelve years old. Her cheeks were like roses, and her" hair&#xD;
which was in long clustering curls, seemed to cover her little&#xD;
figure as a black cloud. Walter went and spoke to Clara, who,&#xD;
laughing, said, "Oh, that is my 'sweet rose. I am very glad&#xD;
is&#xD;

&#xD;
flooR.&#xD;
&#xD;
that your friend has made so good a 'choice. I will introduce&#xD;
him.",&#xD;
She went across the room. to the young girl, brushed away&#xD;
the dark masses of hair from her face, talked with her a little&#xD;
while; andthen beckoned'to Henry Robinson. He crossed the&#xD;
roont directly. "Henry, this is Rose, a little rlse that was&#xD;
plucked away down in the State of Maine, at a place called&#xD;
Bangor, iot' many months ago. She has a loving heart, and is&#xD;
not very well suited for this house She is very low spirited&#xD;
to-night. You must be responsible for het cheerfulness," and,&#xD;
addressing Rose, "In the morning, you aid Mr. Henry come&#xD;
and get breakfast in my parlor. Then the two friends ean&#xD;
-leave together."&#xD;
Rose raised her beautiful gazelle eyes. "You, Miss Clara,&#xD;
-fou--you-his friend-.why, I thought you never "-&#xD;
Clara placed her finger on the Maine girl's lips.  "Yes&#xD;
Rose, I am in love with his friend. I, the haughty Clara.,&#xD;
Now don't say any more. Good-night, both of you," and she&#xD;
crossed to. the sofa, and Walter took a seat by her side.&#xD;
Don't yourthinktha't Rose is exquisitely beautiful, Wal-&#xD;
ter ?'asked'Clara.&#xD;
"I-don't think-look-or care for but one in this room. I&#xD;
believe;1 am getting crazy. That is you, Clara,'.---and as he&#xD;
pressed his arm around her small waist, her exquisitely shaped&#xD;
head fell upon his breast. For soine time they sat and listened&#xD;
to the music. Meanwhile, Rose and Henry had left the par-&#xD;
lor, the former crossing and wishing his companion good-niht.&#xD;
When they reached the sleeping-room of Rose, Henry found a&#xD;
large rooni, luxuriously furnished, and a sofa, upon which Rose&#xD;
ung .herself.&#xD;
"Lock the door and come and tell me all about yourself-.&#xD;
where you have been, who you are, what brought you -here to.&#xD;
night. What magic your friend Walter has, to be accepted by&#xD;
Clara, who never-sees company, except it be some very rich,&#xD;
private friend, although she -frequently goes into the parlor.&#xD;
Tell me every thing, and perhaps I will love you, if you will,"&#xD;
exclaimed Rose, in almost the accents of a little school-girl.&#xD;
Henry took her up in his arms as if she had been a child,&#xD;
and then related to her that he and Walter had been sent off 'on&#xD;
a whaling voyage, that both their fathers were gentlemen,' that&#xD;
Aung together in this way they had become very fondly at.&#xD;
taehe,-and that four years had elapsed since they went away.&#xD;

"Harry is not a pretty name. Henry is better. How  do&#xD;
hate this house! I wish I never had entered it. Bu.--hefgl)o&#xD;
..-it can't be helped. You are the first person tato has ever&#xD;
entered my room that I did not detest in five minutes," sai&#xD;
Rose.,&#xD;
" Why, how is that?" asked Harry.&#xD;
 " You have-treated me as if I were a younglady. You held&#xD;
me in your arms as my brothers once used to do, and you have&#xD;
not once taken advantage of my position. I feel very different&#xD;
to you from what I ever have done to visitors at this house."&#xD;
Rose had met one who had sisters of his own equally beau.&#xD;
tiful as she. The next morning, when, she and Harry Robin-&#xD;
son entered the parlor to take breakfast, she blushed like a&#xD;
young bride who receives congratulations the morning after her&#xD;
wedding night. She attracted the attention of, Clara, who ex-&#xD;
claimed, " Why, you little silly chit. Take care you andMas-&#xD;
ter Harry don't get in love, or you will have Mistress Browat&#xD;
about your ears.. She has no objection to her girls making&#xD;
money, but she don't like to have them fall in love.  Take&#xD;
care,"-.-and she shook her head menacingly.'&#xD;
.Harry Robinson then observed, "Miss Clara, we wish you&#xD;
to be our friend. I want to take Rose out of this sort of busi-&#xD;
ness. She wants to leave it, too."&#xD;
"Treason, treason to good Julia Brown, Why, you foolia&#xD;
child, where will you go ?&#xD;
.  "I wil! fix that somehow, if I can only get her out of this.&#xD;
I have got a pocket-book pretty well lined, an't it, Walter!&#xD;
She says she owes Julia Brown some money," remarked Rob.&#xD;
inson.&#xD;
"How much, Rose dear ?" demanded Clara.&#xD;
" She told me thirty dollars last nht, when 1 refused to&#xD;
talk with that, drunken gambler, and she scolded me until I&#xD;
cried," replied Rose,&#xD;
"She shall go with you if I save to have a quarrel with her.&#xD;
Take the poor child out of the house, Harry, and you will never&#xD;
regret so good a deed. . Ask her out. to walk when you go.&#xD;
Then take her to a hotel in the Bowery, called the Nor&#xD;

exclaimed Clara Norris, earnestly..&#xD;
$he never shall, if I can help it," and the young sailor&#xD;
mreantwhathe said.&#xD;
The breakfast was finished somewhat hurriedly, for Rose&#xD;
was somewhat anxious. Then she got ready. Clara walked&#xD;
to the door, and quietly undid the fastenings. Henry Robin.&#xD;
son and Rose Banker followed, and in a moment were outside&#xD;
free in the street.  Clara carefully fastened the street door,&#xD;
and returned to her own apartments.&#xD;
"Who knows, Walter, but that a human soul is saved?&#xD;
What a time I shall have with Madame Julia! Now, dear&#xD;
Walter,:'have you thought over what I have proposed? And&#xD;
have you made up your mind, sfter the iost mature delibera-&#xD;
tion, to accept my proposition ?" exclaimed Clara.&#xD;
Before I give the, replies of Walter to these questions, I&#xD;
must make a few explanations. Clara Norris had often seen&#xD;
Water Granville, and knew.his features well at the time she&#xD;
was the mistress of Mr. Nordheim. She had seen him at the&#xD;
theatre, had seen him with Miss Madison Pinckney; and al.&#xD;
though he had grown older and more manly in appearance, yet&#xD;
there-was no very great change in the young boy she had&#xD;
known, and the young man she found in her parlor on the night&#xD;
that Walter came.off from the ship. She knew him at once.'&#xD;
Walter did not know her-did not know her name even. ' Of&#xD;
course, his female relations never allowed it to pass their lips,&#xD;
and. his father or his father's friends and clerks were not likely&#xD;
to talk with him upon such a subject-one which affected 'the&#xD;
moral character of his father's partner. Consequently. when&#xD;
he met Clara Norris in her parlor, he was ignorant of her per-&#xD;
-on or of her name and antecedent. -He was extremely flat-&#xD;
tered to find in an expensive house'of its kind a beautiful wo-&#xD;
Man evidently flattered with his appearance-the more flat.&#xD;
tered, as she was of a higher grade than the regular residents&#xD;
of the inansion, and not dependent upon prostituting her per.&#xD;
son for a livelihood. $he was 'beautiful-far more charming.&#xD;
than any-of the others, and placed herself at his disposal for&#xD;
lone .oertaily it was notfo' money, for she made it a condition&#xD;
'of ier love and favor that money should not beoffei'ed her.&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
Walter was vain at heart, and not spposing Clara kneyw any-&#xD;
thing, about him or his fami-y'.friends, he- came to the conclu-&#xD;
sion that she loved him, and he entered the luxurious trap&#xD;
without a thought of danger, and supposed that when. break-&#xD;
fast was over in the morning he would probably never see her&#xD;
again,&#xD;
But what were the thoughts of the gifted syren, who had so&#xD;
adroitly flung her auburn meshes around young Walter? Love!&#xD;
She had no more love, than would naturally arise towards a&#xD;
handsome, vigorous youth, who had been absent on' a long&#xD;

respond to his caresses. But she had deeper and more danx.&#xD;
gerous designs ; and she no sooner was satisfied that the run-&#xD;
away son Qf Pitt Granville was before her, than her mind. was&#xD;
decided to have him at all cbsts and at all sacrifices. The first&#xD;
step was to place him under obligations to her.&#xD;
When Henry Robinson and Rose had left the, parlor, Clara&#xD;
waited a short time, and then whispered to Walter,&#xD;
"Do you'see any that you can love better than me&#xD;
A loving kiss, and a whispered "No," was the reply.&#xD;
44Follow me then ;" and she sprang up and went to her par-&#xD;
lor. Walter entered with'her, and fastened the door.&#xD;
"0, what will become of me, dear Walter?  I am madly in&#xD;
love with you! I feared that you might see some one that yoa&#xD;
lvould like better than me, and I have been. dreadtuily alarm,&#xD;
ed ;" and she flung her arms around him. "I am fainting-&#xD;
andress me and l4y me on the sofa! What can you think of&#xD;
 me?"&#xD;
Walter was flattered in the worst manner. He did help her&#xD;
to undress,.and there was revealed to him charms that would&#xD;
have tempted Saint Anthony. He was frenzied; but the artw&#xD;
ful girl was perfectly herself. She had her purpose.&#xD;
"How dare you attempt such liberties !" and she assumed a&#xD;
sterner air. "I da love you, but I know nothing of your I&#xD;
am a fool!Here you are, a strange sailor in my room, and  .&#xD;
almostnaked! What is there about you that has so fascinated&#xD;
me 1 - Don't dare to take' a liberty with meX! Now tell me al&#xD;
about yourself. Who are you?   Where do you belong. ?  f&#xD;
you will tell me the truth, that moment I will let you carry ,ine&#xD;
in yonder ;" and she pointed to the- sleeping apartment, the&#xD;
door. of which was opened. "If you do not, you shall go.&#xD;
You are dressed, and I will open -that door, and call help, bt&#xD;
you shall leave me. Now kneel down by mie, and tell te all."&#xD;
Walter was nearly mad.-frantie with the ai-ts ofgten.~&#xD;

He commenced ad gave her his name, his history, the -name&#xD;
of his father,. in facteverything that he knew. Clara listened&#xD;
attentively. She knew it all before. She knew more than&#xD;
Walter did, for there were many things about his own family&#xD;
that he did not know. She did not offer to tell him these, but&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"aDear Walter, ITam not such a mad fool as I thought I was.&#xD;
You are a gentleman, and that is why I loved you from the&#xD;
first. ,Now I am yours"-ido what-yoiu please with m."&#xD;
Her object Was achieved, and she gave way to ill her fiery&#xD;
and fieree passions, which had been soatborougbly aroused by&#xD;
the young sailor. As he lay clasped in-her arms, could he have&#xD;
known her secret thoughts.-her feelings of gratified revenge!&#xD;
There was a light in her sleeping apartment.&#xD;
"0,"-thought Clara Norris, "could old Granville only know&#xD;
this! His son--my partner! It is a sweet revenge! Tom,&#xD;
too, who has .abused me so-where- is his loved, nephew?&#xD;
Here in my a'rms-4-he abused, neglected, insulted Clara Nor-&#xD;

bosom of Clara Norris! 0, this is delicious, exquisite re-&#xD;

passions, lust; hate and revenge all being gratified, she passed&#xD;
a sleepless night;&#xD;
The next morning she met, as we have related, Henry and&#xD;
Rose. She bad done apparently a good act, but it was to bind&#xD;
the friedof Walter to her more closely, that she had assisted&#xD;
in his running off Rose.&#xD;
Whenthey had departed, Walter spoke of leaving.   .&#xD;
"Indeed, sir, you shall do no such thing. You are my&#xD;
prisoner. You shall not leave this house nor this room this&#xD;
day of oar Lord. It is Sunday, and. you shall worship here.&#xD;

"I will go anywhere with you-wto the devil, if you say the&#xD;
word," replied Walter.&#xD;
"We will see your friend and Rose settled, and then we will&#xD;
go," observed Clara.&#xD;
Will you see Harry all snug with his woman?"&#xD;
"What is his name ?" asked Cllara.&#xD;
" Henry Robinson;" was the reply.&#xD;
"Is his father the rich judge of that name&#xD;

I do, sir. I am not ashamed of it. Why do you ask ?"'&#xD;
Mere curiosity. Nothing more, L4spure you,'" replied the,&#xD;
pawnbroker. "Most people sneak in here as though they had&#xD;
been robbing a hen-roost, and felt mean., - I am not ashamed&#xD;
o( my-business; and I like a customer who comes openly to me&#xD;
and says what he wants; and if I can let him what he needs I&#xD;
do it without any chaffling. Now I'ye given you twenty-five&#xD;
dollars on. that watch. If you had wanted fifty dollars you&#xD;
should have had it," said the pawnbroker.&#xD;
"You are a man of business, Mr. Simpson.  ad, you must&#xD;
sOe a good deal of the under-current of life. I would like to be&#xD;
hired by you for six months, just for the sake of studying&#xD;
human character. But don't you get taken in sometimes ?"'&#xD;
asked Marion.&#xD;
"Indeed we do. It requires one to keep his eyes open to.&#xD;
do this business and make any thing by it.~ We have so many&#xD;
rogues to deal with that we regard every man as a rogue until&#xD;
we are taught better by experience. We hear some sad stories&#xD;
-some heart-rending stories. We don't know whether they&#xD;
aretrue or not., Some doubtless are, but ' we have no time to&#xD;
examine)' replied the pawnbroker.&#xD;
Those who love to relieve suffering would find lots of&#xD;
opportunities, M!r. Simpson, if they would watch those who&#xD;
bamein here for relief,"' said Marion.&#xD;
'Indeed you never spoke a truer word. Did you notice a&#xD;
very beautiful girl, who went out just as you came in ? Neatly&#xD;
but poorly dressedI She pledged two sheets for twenty-five&#xD;
cents. She wanted fifty. Said it was to get food for a sick&#xD;
mother until she got her pay next Saturday night, when she&#xD;
would return the money. She Js a book-folder. Her mother&#xD;
and she can sleep between blankets-do without sheets.--can't&#xD;
do without food. I am a blessing, to that girl. But for -me,&#xD;
where would she go to keep her mother from starving On&#xD;
the town !-where else I" emphatically demanded Mr. Simpson,&#xD;
"You are a philosopher. I wish I had known how she was&#xD;
situated. She should nothave wanted a few dollars to help&#xD;
her along in her dreary walk," said Marion, kindly.&#xD;
"Oh, yes! I dare say-and you w9ul have wanted some&#xD;
thing else before you finished with her. Yotng men are young&#xD;
men. I make it a point never to speak of what I know in&#xD;
reference to young females who conme to my shop. Were I to&#xD;
do SO, I should be the cause of the ruin of a great many. Now&#xD;
I know that young -girl's address., She gave it true. It is on&#xD;
the duplicate ticket for tLhe two sheets. You seen' to be a&#xD;

&#xD;
little better than these seducers about town;. but do you&#xD;
suppose I would put you in the way of temptation, and, having&#xD;
told you how destitute that girl is, tell you also where you&#xD;
could find her?  No, sir. You would go, relieve her, get her&#xD;
gratitude, talk marriage and honor, and all that sort of lying&#xD;
nonsense, and-probably I Aould not see her again until byes&#xD;
and-bye, after the lapse of a year, she would come here, rouged&#xD;
like the red sides of a peach, to make a raise on- a2 gold watch&#xD;
or a silk dress to pay room rent to some boss prostitute. No,&#xD;
sir. I don't do business that way. I don't trust such secrets&#xD;
to any body," said the conscientious broker.&#xD;
"But, my' dear sir, you don't suppose .1 am such a sort of&#xD;
person, or that I would use information so obtained to debauch&#xD;
a young and beautiful girl ?" replied Marion, a little angered&#xD;
and mortified.&#xD;
"I do not know what you might do. I do know that- you&#xD;
will not get any information from me about it. Poverty to a&#xD;
young and attractive girl is a fearful thing any how,; bat it is&#xD;
her defensive armor only so long as prowlers don't know it.&#xD;
When a bad man is aware that a girl and her poor mother are&#xD;
in a state of starvation, he has the game in his own hands, ifihe&#xD;
chooses to run it down," said the pawnbroker.,&#xD;
In the pawnbroker's shop of the worthy Simpson there isa A&#xD;
long counter, but at the extreme end there are some three or&#xD;
four cubby-houses, opened to the counter, but w'th high sides;&#xD;
and when the door of this little pigeon-house is closed, it can&#xD;
be locked inside, and the party occupying it can keep partially&#xD;
concealed. Just as the- pawnbroker had finished: about the&#xD;
girl, a person entered hurriedly, and passed into. one of the&#xD;
boxes. Marion was startled.-he thought he had recognized&#xD;
the person, although he had but a glimpse of him as he passed.&#xD;
The party 'handed to the pawnbroker a dark-colored mahogany&#xD;
box, sayin',&#xD;
How much can you let me have on these V1&#xD;
Simpson opened the box, for the key was in it.&#xD;
-.They are hair-trigger duelling pistols," said the applicant..&#xD;
"Old-fashioned affairs-out of date.  Wouldn't sell for&#xD;
much,'" replied the pawnbroker.&#xD;
"They have been used on two melancholy occasions with&#xD;
deadly effect," observed the applicant.&#xD;
"iEave- a sort of historical value, have they? .But it don't&#xD;
count much with us," said Mr. Simpson.&#xD;
" That identical pair of pistols, sir, was used in the diuel be.&#xD;

" You are- Mr. Barton, I suppose,'' asked the pawubroker.&#xD;
"I am' not, sir, but I was a second to that gentleman' when&#xD;
his opponent was killed'!' replied the applicant.&#xD;
"Indeed! How much do you want on them?   If they had&#xD;
been used to murder all creation, it wouldn't make 'em worth&#xD;
amite more in this shop," said Simpson, very coolly.&#xD;
"I dare say it would not; but those pistols must have cost&#xD;
over eighty guineas," urged the applicant, and added, "I want&#xD;
twenty dollars upon them."&#xD;
"Can't doit-will give you ten, if that will do ;" and the&#xD;
pawnbroker turned to! another customer.&#xD;
"Give it to me, then, and take them," said the applicant.&#xD;
"Your name and residence, sir," asked the pawnbroker.&#xD;
".Smith43 Centre street,"' was the reply.&#xD;
First name ?" asked the pawnbroker.&#xD;

The tickets were arranged, and the applicant took his deo&#xD;
parture.&#xD;
" Goodaye, Mr. Simpson," said Marion Monck,&#xD;
"Good-bye, sir. Come in again-glad to 'see you," replied&#xD;
Mr.: Simpson.,&#xD;
No sooner was Marion Monek out in the street, than he, ad-&#xD;
dressed himself thus: "Poor Mae! This will :never do, I&#xD;
am hard up,. but he is worse off, or he would never have&#xD;
pledged those redoubtable 'duelling-pistols of his, which he&#xD;
exhibits with so much reverence. What can have happened ?"&#xD;
He hurried up to Centre street, and there he - found the&#xD;
Colonel sipping a glass of liquor, as though nothing had-hap-&#xD;
pened.&#xD;
"Rgad, I will not mortify him.so much as to .tell him I am&#xD;
aware of his visit to the pawnbroker's," thought Marion ; and&#xD;
as he approached Colonel Mac Neil, who was so. short-sighted&#xD;
that'he could not distinguish a face. before he heard the voice,&#xD;
he 'exclaimed, "Good: morning, Colonel;. how do you feel this&amp;amp;&#xD;
morning IAnything new.?: I will join you in a drink. I col-&#xD;
lected some money this morning, and am. quite flush."&#xD;
Saying this, he pulled out a roll, and without waiting for a&#xD;
reply to his first salutation, gaily remarked, "If you want some,&#xD;
Colonel, help yourself-but-I know you never want money."&#xD;
My dear boy, you were never more mistaken in your life,&#xD;
Ido want money..l. want just twenty dollars. 'I have ten....&#xD;

&#xD;
see it-and-I will help myself to a ten from your pile-if yott&#xD;
can spare it, that is ?"&#xD;
"Easily, my dear Colonel, and as long as you want: it,"&#xD;
added Marion.&#xD;
" No, I don't want it very long. The fact is, Marion," and&#xD;
here the Colonel lowered his voice to a whisper, "I have had&#xD;
a hard time of it lately. Things have all gone wrong. I am&#xD;
getting quite discouraged., I have a home with the proprietor.&#xD;
of this store-old porter of mine when. I was' rich, you know.&#xD;
Always kept some cash in his hands, and I hate to borrow&#xD;
without being able to repay, eh.? Safe rule. that, eh 7 ..Keep&#xD;
one horse saddled and one in the tablee' eh ?" said the poor&#xD;
Colonel.&#xD;
There was an unusual wildness about Colonel Mae Neil as&#xD;
he said this, which Marion was very sorry to perceive. He&#xD;
discovered that the Colonel had, been drinking very freely the&#xD;
day before, and he was so nervous that he was obliged to take&#xD;
three stiff drinks while Marion was with him, to steady hiEs&#xD;
nerves. Marion felt inclined- to give the Colonel a few words&#xD;
of friendly advice, and to caution* him against excessive ,drink;&#xD;
but he had hardly spoken a word respecting it, when Mae Neil&#xD;
uttered the sentence," Boy, stop! Not a word more, or never&#xD;
dare speak to me again !&#xD;
Marion was'silenced. He was awed by this wreck of u-&#xD;
manity, who was so much older, and who had seen so many&#xD;
vicissitudes in life;, and he mentally resolved never'to opes.&#xD;
his lips again upon the subject, no matter what opeurred  He&#xD;
felt it to be useless. For a proud man, who-has become ad-&#xD;
dieted to drink, and continues it to excess, is the last man in the&#xD;
world to permit old friends to discuss such a subject, or, to&#xD;
give him any advice. He regards it as a wanton insult and&#xD;
would affront the only remaining friend he had on earth to reo-&#xD;
,ent such interference.&#xD;
There were in thattplace other persons well known to Colquel&#xD;
-Mae Neil, and also to Marion. .One ,of these,-whom: we have.&#xD;
alluded to as Charley, the clergyman's brother, was a very sen+&#xD;
sible and a very practical man, Loss of businessof prop ty,&#xD;
and utter hopelessness, had led him to abandon hi nselfto&#xD;
drink to drown sorrow, but he had a limit whiehhe never ex-&#xD;
ceeded. He never went to bed sober, but he managed to eat&#xD;
his neils regularly, and this gave the rum he drank some .&#xD;
to feed on. Mr. Charles addressed Marion and requested to&#xD;
speak with him alone.4 Marion retired to the back of the stor,&#xD;
and both took seats upon a pipe of mixed gin. -&#xD;

"Mr. Monek, I want to tell you that our friend the Colonel&#xD;
is going it too strong. He catl't stand it. If he don't let up'&#xD;
a little he is a croaker. His constitution is cracked."&#xD;
Marion asked in some alarm if anything of importance had&#xD;
recently, happened.&#xD;
"'0 no, except the Colonel has been keeping .up a tremen-&#xD;
dous head of stean, and until a very late hour. I heard him&#xD;
say this morning, when he came down, that he had had no sleep&#xD;
for forty-eight hours. When he took his first drink this morn-&#xD;
ing., I had to help him steady his glass to get it to his lips.&#xD;
Hkawas very shaky, I assure you. It dan't last. long,", ob-&#xD;
served the good-natured Mr. Charles.&#xD;
"1Good God, I should think notI But what can be done ?.&#xD;
I don't like to-say anything. I did speak to him just now, and&#xD;
he gave me a reprimand that I shall not forget in a hurry. I&#xD;
will do anything that I can do. Tell me what I can do-?" said&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
"He ought to be placed under some restraint, sir. He can't&#xD;
control himself. Has he no friends that would pay for placing&#xD;
him in the Hospital? It is only twelve dollars. They cure&#xD;
him for that, and keep him from drink while he is there. If&#xD;
'he is fool enough to drink when he comes out, and rush it again,&#xD;
why he must take the consequences," observed the prudent&#xD;
Charles.&#xD;
"The money," replied Marion, I'. is of no consequence. That&#xD;
-,is easily raised. But who will broach the subject to the Col-&#xD;
onel?  If he don't see the necessity of going to the hospital&#xD;
he will not go, and there is an end of-it."&#xD;
" True, very true. But he is getting worse every day. If&#xD;
he don't see the necessity to-day, he may to-morrow. I will&#xD;
try and-see what I can do. He may listen to .me, as I am&#xD;
nearly of his age. He will not to you-.-that is' certain.. I will&#xD;
talk to you again to-mhorrow ;" and with this benevolent senti-&#xD;
ment Mr. Charles put an end to the conversation by reporting&#xD;
himself in person to an invitation to take a drink.&#xD;
Marion began to sicken of the scenie. LiHe saw Colonel Maco&#xD;
Neil again going up to the bar for another'drink. He saw even&#xD;
the proprietor shake his head reprovingly to the Colonel.&#xD;
Then Marioan ade his escape from the premises by a rear&#xD;
door. He was very anxious about the Colonel. He had 're- -&#xD;
eived twenty-five dollars, and he had let the Colonel have ten.&#xD;
he went at opece to his landlady, and gave her the remaining fif-&#xD;

monico's in Beaver street. He hurried down there, and luck-&#xD;

scolded him for, not coming oftener to see him.&#xD;
"I have sought" you this morning, Count, to tell you about&#xD;
poor Colonel Mac Neil. You know I like him. I this morn-&#xD;
ing gave him ten dollars."&#xD;
"Where did you get the money to spend on him ?"&#xD;
Marion's blood rushed to his cheeks, and. he took out his&#xD;
pawn ticket.&#xD;
"1There, sir. I pledged my watch to get twenty-five dollars,&#xD;
and ten dollars Igave poor Mac, and fifteen dollars I paid my&#xD;
landlady," said Marion.&#xD;
"Pshaw, my boy-don't get vexed with me-! I have a fixed&#xD;
purpose for you. It is only fair that I should pay your exa&#xD;
penses until my plans are ripe. Here is money. Don't turn&#xD;
an angry look at me-I will not see it. Here are two bills of&#xD;
one hundred dollars each'-make -them go as far as they will.&#xD;
This money is for yourself-not for Colonel Mae Neil. Still,&#xD;
Marion, as the Colonel was the means of making you and I ac-&#xD;
quainted, I will do anything for him that you desire. Where&#xD;
can I find him?  I will go with.you now," said the Count.&#xD;
Marion was surprised at the alacrity of the Count. He re-&#xD;
ceived and pocketed the twohundred dollars without, ny&#xD;
remark. The two started for Centre street, While on the&#xD;
way the Count was pleasant and communicative, and talked&#xD;
upon a variety of topics.: At lasthe said,&#xD;
"Upon second' thoughts, I do not wish you to go with me to&#xD;
see Colonel Mae Neil. Tell me where he is to be -found, and&#xD;
I will find him. Now go and get your watch and join me at&#xD;
the Colonel's."&#xD;
Marion complied with the wish of the Count's. As he en-&#xD;
tered Simpson's the second time that day, he handed him the&#xD;
ticket and a hundred dollar bill. Mr. Simpson received it,&#xD;
gave the change, and ordered a boy to'go get the watch. He&#xD;
made no comment. -.Most men would. have said something, as,&#xD;
" 0, you are in luck ;" "Have you been robbing anybody ?"&#xD;
or "Found a gold mine ?" but such a man was not Mr. Simpson.&#xD;
Commenting was not in his line. There was some little delay&#xD;
attending the delivery of the watch, and when Marion reached&#xD;
No. 43 Centre street, where he was to meet Count Falsechin.&#xD;
ski, he found that gentleman engaged in earnest conversation&#xD;
with Colonel Mac Neil.  Marion did not interrupted caion-&#xD;

and perfectly sober. He-remarked this fat to Mr. Charles.&#xD;
The latter was an old soldier. He observed in reply,&#xD;
"That is all false. He is drinking upon dead liquor in his&#xD;
system. A gallon of rum would not have made him drunk this&#xD;
morning. But to-morrow--wait until to-morrow! See him in&#xD;
the morning! It will be dreadful, and it will be worse every&#xD;
succeeding day, until the Colonel has the delirium  tremens.&#xD;
I know just'how-it works--you can't tell me anything about&#xD;
that matter. . Colonel Mac Neil don't eat anything-he. don't.&#xD;
sleep, and he drinks like a fish. Of- course such a bad state&#xD;
of things cannot last long. There will be a pull up some time&#xD;
or another."&#xD;
Having delivered these brief philosophical observations, the&#xD;
brotBer of the Trinity Church clergyman went to take another&#xD;
drink to his own cheek.&#xD;
Marion approached the Count and Colonel Mae Neil. The'&#xD;
latter spoke in a stern voice; "No, sir. No, sir. Not as a&#xD;
favor. Not as a loan from you, sir. I am a gentleman, sir. I&#xD;
am of the race of Mac Neil. I accept the hundred dollars you&#xD;
are so kind as to loan me, provided you, sir, accept this ridic'&#xD;
ulous pawn-ticket for a p'etty ten dollars for pistols that have&#xD;
killed a Hamilton and a Graham."&#xD;
'The Count took the-ticket at-once, for he was afraid of .a&#xD;
scene. "That i's right, sir. We are now equals. It is a reg-&#xD;
ular business transaction. You have collateral.security of at&#xD;
least two hundred and fifty dollars for a loan -of one hundred&#xD;
dollars. Now let us take a drink, .-What will you have, Count&#xD;
Falsechinski ?" Colonel Mac Neil continued.&#xD;
The Count pleasantly named his drink to the bar-tender.&#xD;
"Count," continued the Colonel, "did you ever see .in me,-&#xD;
sir, any thing incompatible with the character of a gentleman?&#xD;
One of the race of Mac Neil.. The 'best' blood. in the High-&#xD;
lands in olden times, and I am proud of it, sir;. You are a&#xD;
blooded 'masculine,. if Poles can. have blood, Count, eh? EXx-&#xD;
cuse the pun, but you are a Pole, are you not? A noble Pole.&#xD;
Well, success to you. Here is your very good .health."&#xD;
The Count-replied in courteous terms, and began to look at&#xD;
the door ,and seemed uneasy. Just at that: moment Marion&#xD;
noticed Mr. O'Doemall seated near the chairs recent oceu -&#xD;
pied by the Colonel and the Count.  O'Doemall had evidently&#xD;
been a witness to the money scene between the two parties.&#xD;
As soon as he perceived that he was noticed by Marion, he&#xD;
came forward in his bold, daring .way, 'said " How *d'y ?". to&#xD;
Marion, and addressed both the Count -and Colonel.   The-&#xD;

former bowed, but the latter treated Mr. O'Doemall with cold.&#xD;
ness, and made an excuse to leave. O'Doemall then ordered a&#xD;
drink for himself, and began to converse with the Colonel.&#xD;
Marion no sooner observed the departure of the Count than he&#xD;
followed him into the street, but he lost him, and concluded&#xD;
not to return to the drinking saloon.&#xD;
- The artful O'Doemall had it all his own. way with Colonel&#xD;
Mac Neil after the departure of the Count Falsechinski and&#xD;
Marion Monek. lie flattered his vanity, and the Colonel was,,&#xD;
fast getting too intoxicated to notice the hollowness of praise&#xD;
coming from such foul lips, atid he also forgot the character of&#xD;
the man with whom he was associating.&#xD;
Finally, the Colonel expressed his intention of going and&#xD;
spending an evening with his family,&#xD;
"Family !" interrupted O'Doemall, ." I did not know that&#xD;
you had a family. Where do they live ?"&#xD;
This question for a moment sobered the Colonel, who felt&#xD;
that he had said too much, and with a scowl at his impudent&#xD;
companion, remarked, "You are a rascal. Clear out at once,&#xD;
or I will order you to be put out."&#xD;
Mr. O'Doemall went out at once, but his--departure was not&#xD;
noticed by the Colonel. Unluckily.-for him that this artful&#xD;
scamp had again been permitted to renew an, acquaintance&#xD;
whjch had ended for ever, but for his kindness to Marion&#xD;
Monek when sick. Mr. O'Doemail had seen the Count hand&#xD;
Colonel Mac Neil money. He had tried to get into Mac Nelsa&#xD;
good graces,, but- had failed. He now determined to. watch&#xD;
him. Shortly after Colonel Mac Neil left 43 Centre street,&#xD;
and passed over to the west side of Broadway. At: several&#xD;
stores he stopped and made purchases.. Some of the smaller&#xD;
articles so' purchased he carried on himself. The, others he or-&#xD;
dered sent to the address he left with the different store keep.&#xD;
era. When he had satisfied himself, he continued on his wy&#xD;
to 27 Harrison street, and entered the house. No sooner had&#xD;
the door closed than O'Doemall, who had been following him,&#xD;
crossed the street to the house, and after having carefully no.&#xD;
ticed the number, he passel down the street to the dook.&#xD;
"I have housed my game, and l' will try and amuse myself&#xD;
for a short time, or until he comes out," was his soliloquy.&#xD;

CHAPTER LI.&#xD;
The Plans of Walter Granville and Miss Norris- -Juia' Brown-Te Dea&#xD;
parture of Rose-A-Miss Norris leaves Miss Brown's Residenee.&#xD;
IF Walter Granville had -returned like the Prodigal Son in&#xD;
the year 18- or thereabouts, no doubt old- Granville would&#xD;
have bid him welcome, got up a great. dinner, and celebrated&#xD;
the event with considerable rejoicings ; but young Granville&#xD;
came back after years of absence with no repentant feelings.&#xD;
His father had kicked him out, and Walter felt much obliged&#xD;
to him that he had done so. It had made.a man of him--.made&#xD;
a free man.  He had returned to this city because the vessel&#xD;
in which he had been cruising was ordered to New York  He&#xD;
had landed without intending to call upon his father, fiends,&#xD;
or any body else. As a rover he had called at No. 100 Church&#xD;
street, because he had known: in earlier fears that the house at&#xD;
that number wa's kept for' pleasure purposes. He had money&#xD;
to spend, and he intended to spend some of it there, and 'the&#xD;
meeting with Miss Norris was entirely accidental. Hb regard.&#xD;
ed it 'as a piece of good fortune. -Her curious conduct had&#xD;
saved him money, and he felt obliged.&#xD;
When Clara.proposed to Walter Granville to remain there&#xD;
that Sunday, and to go. up in the country with her, he con-"&#xD;
sented at once, because he had nothing to do on board the ves-&#xD;
sel, and nothing in town that he was aware of.  His sea chest'&#xD;
was where he could get it at any moment, and he  no alarm&#xD;
about that.&#xD;
Neither Clara Norris nor Walter Granville had any idea of&#xD;
what. a storm was brewing' in Church street, to bo shortly&#xD;
poured out upon their devoted heads by the worthy Mrs. Ju-&#xD;
lia Brown. That lady was not a woman to be robbed of one&#xD;
of her most beautiful night birds without uttering -her moth*&#xD;
erly wings.&#xD;
This lady deserves more than a passing notice. Previous to&#xD;
the date of our Chapter, Julia Brown kept a two-story house&#xD;
of ill-fame in Leonard street.  It was pulled down' in 1837 to&#xD;
make room for the new Italian Opera House.. Thence Madam&#xD;

VIGOR *-So&#xD;
moved to 100 Church street, and after residing there for some&#xD;
years, she returned to Leonard street, andin one of the most&#xD;
magnificent Palaces of Sin.ever built in New York, continued&#xD;
business for a long time. This house was -'next door to the&#xD;
Italian Opera House, When that edifice was burnt, Julia's&#xD;
house was consumed also. It was in this fire that the celebra-&#xD;
ted Mr. 0., who was sleeping with the noted courtesan Mary&#xD;
Moore, the female partner in London of Colonel Monroe Ed-&#xD;
wards. G. barely escaped in his shirt from being burned to&#xD;
death.&#xD;
Miss Julia Brown made a 'large fortune in this business.--&#xD;
She was a beautiful woman, but not immoral herself. She was&#xD;
married to a fancy man named Jack Harris. For a long time&#xD;
he was her fancy man, but when a daughter was born, he be.&#xD;
came her husband.&#xD;
This Jack Harris was also a character in his day. He was a&#xD;
sporting man, drank hard, lived high, made bets on every&#xD;
thing-.-and in a word was a thorough-bred gamble-.  He was&#xD;
also a great politician, and in those days ruled the Fifth Ward&#xD;
Democratic politics, and presided at the primary meeting that&#xD;
first-elected Fernando Wood to a seat as a member of the&#xD;
Young Men's Committee at Tammany Hall.&#xD;
Jackiarris had a friend named Allen who would lend him&#xD;
a thousand dollars whenever he needed it, and for a week's&#xD;
useof this sum would charge Jack one hundred.  Miss Julia&#xD;
Brown, though conducting a business for the public do'wnItown,&#xD;
had her own magnificent residence in Fourth street, up towi.&#xD;
At this house lived her datighter, who probably never was in-&#xD;
side of her mother's "place of business." The daiughter was&#xD;
not pretty, b'ut intelligent and virtuous. While living in&#xD;
Fourth street, which house she owned, Julia came down in&#xD;
her carriage. to -her business, in the morning, and retired at&#xD;
night, leaving in charge for the later hours, a housekeeper.&#xD;
All of a sudden, from being a pretty sinner, Miss. Julia&#xD;
Brown became a violent saint. Her first appearance in this&#xD;
character was at a sale of pews in a Universalist dhrrch in her&#xD;
neighborhood.. She bought a pew half way up the middle&#xD;
aisle, and paid for it one hundred and seventy dollars. 'She at.&#xD;
tended this church, occupying her own seat, for several Sun-&#xD;
days, accompanied by her daughter. No one knew her-hbut&#xD;
on the sixth Sunday, a gentleman in the adjoining seat becanme&#xD;
aware of the proiimity of his old aquaintnnce Julia .Brown,&#xD;
and he mentioned the circumstance to his :wife, who- was a&#xD;
member of the church. She told it to a dgzeni 9hji- female&#xD;

members, and it kicked up a delight for the devil in that eon-.&#xD;
gregation. Alarge majority were for putting Julia out ofsthe&#xD;
synagogue without a word of explanation.  More peaceable&#xD;
measures were recommended by the clergyman, and it was de-w&#xD;
cided that he 'should call upon the frail but somewhat notorious&#xD;
sinner at her own domicile.'&#xD;
He did so. Julia was a good actor. She spread herself at&#xD;
once : confessed that she had been bad-very 'bad, but that&#xD;
she had repented, was living in private-had married Jack-&#xD;
was bringing up her daughter right, and had hopes that, she&#xD;
should be enabled to convert Jack Harris, and iget him  all&#xD;
straight.  The clergyman felt bad.  It was a mighty hard&#xD;
case.' He preached a sermon about Mary' Magdalen-the eon-&#xD;
gregation sympathized-and the upshot was that Julia conti.&#xD;
ued in favor, and eventually became a religious lioness -in that&#xD;
church, and visited freely 'with the different families of that&#xD;
congregation-and among others, that of Mr. Allen,&#xD;
Meanwhile Julia did sell out her establishment down town&#xD;
"--or. pretended that she had done so. Her daughter had&#xD;
grown up to be a fine young girl. She was courted by several&#xD;
young men. One of them, was Mr. F. E., one of the. hand-&#xD;
somest men in 'the City, or that could be found in the State'&#xD;
r. . was accepted, and the parties were married,ewith the'&#xD;
full cnsent ani approval of both Julia Brown and Mr. Harris.&#xD;
Not long after the marriage was soleranized, Julia, whowas&#xD;
posted in all the wickedness of the world in general,. and of&#xD;
mankind in particular, discovered that her, son-in-law had&#xD;
become' ~el fancy man of one Ellen MeVean, a handsome&#xD;
courtezan that resided with Cinderella Marshall in Leonard&#xD;
street, opposite Julia's-old house. The mother went ,to work&#xD;
and prured a divorce for her daughter. Not long after,&#xD;
another suitor appeared. He was i lawyer, named McM. He&#xD;
married the divorced Mrs E. Then Julia Brown died,&#xD;
leavm'g a very large property' to this -'daughter* and left Allen&#xD;
(Jack's friend) executor. Then Jack died, and he also left his&#xD;
property to this daughter, -and also made Allen his executor.&#xD;
The daughter of Julia was now rich -inher own right. She&#xD;
owned a large tract on the Fifth avenue. Then -she built. a,&#xD;
house and moved into it with' her husband. The lady believed&#xD;
that money was the sesame that opened all doors. - She had&#xD;
money, and she desired to shine in the Fifth avenue. But&#xD;
powerful as is' money, it failed to place Mrs. McM. at thelhead&#xD;
of the sett about her. 'One's grandmother may~ have been -a&#xD;
washeruioman, or never have had any existence. But when&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGO11. U7&#xD;
one's mother is notorious for having made th6 money we are in.&#xD;
lined to spend off the souls and bodies of human beings -by&#xD;
keeping a house of i1llfame, it brings things too near home'. It&#xD;
is coming it too strong. So thought some 'of Mrs. McM.'s&#xD;
neighbors, and they "cut her."&#xD;
Disappointed as was Mrs. MOM. in such a result, she was&#xD;
not dispirited or disheartened. She determined to command&#xD;
success-to shine as a -star somewhere. Her mother was a&#xD;
woman whose fame was' a public one, why should not the&#xD;
daughter appeal to the public for favor, although in different.&#xD;
way, and under somewhat different auspices? This-decided&#xD;
other, so she took to Shakespeare and the stage, and made her&#xD;
first appearance in  uffalo. She came to New York, and hired&#xD;
the Academy of Mu ic for one night. Not satisfied with these&#xD;
appearances, she determined to try another' feat. She 'became&#xD;
manager of a theatre in Chambers street, and we hope she, will&#xD;
carve her way to a niche in the temple of fame.&#xD;
This digression is not out of place. It is an episode. that&#xD;
could not be left out; and 'having followed in brief the for-&#xD;
tunes of the mother to her death, and the daughter to her be-&#xD;
coming a. public character, we now return to Julia Brown when&#xD;
she was in her glory at No.100 'Church street, coining money&#xD;
as if she were owner of a mitit.&#xD;
'We left Walter Granrille and 'Clara waiting in the parlor&#xD;
appropriated to Clara. It was near midday before Mrs Brown&#xD;
made hr appearance.. It was then reported to her that Rosa&#xD;
had not been down. Mrs. Brown sent at once to Clara Norris&#xD;
to ask if she knew anything about Rose. Clara made no reply,&#xD;
but went to Mrs. Brown herself.&#xD;
" Rose is not in my room, Mrs. Brown," said Clara.&#xD;
"Did not she and her companion of last-night get breakfast&#xD;
with you ?"" asked Mrs. Brown, who was getting warm.&#xD;
" They did," replied Miss Norris.&#xD;
"Then 'where is Rose ?" again demanded Mrs. Brown.&#xD;
" To tell you the truth, Mrs. Julia Brown, I think.Rose has&#xD;
gone for good. She was but a child, and khe personieho was&#xD;
with her last night took her off," was the reply of Miss Norris.&#xD;
" Why in h-il did you not stop iti Why didaryou not irouse&#xD;
the house-rouse ine? I had- rather have lost five hundred-&#xD;
dollars than that girl !" exclaimed Julia&#xD;
" I was not aware of that. I let her out myself," innocently&#xD;
observed Miss Norris&#xD;
" You, Clara Norris ! Do you dare to tell -me this I" ana&#xD;

she seized kn ironbar that fastened one of the windows, and&#xD;
approachedher as if to strike.&#xD;
iave a care, Mrs.]Brown ,, One step nearer, and you will&#xD;
goi to h--:1 before your time ;" and Clara drew from her bo-&#xD;
som a small dagger. She held it so close to Mrs. Julia, that&#xD;
the latter dropped the bar, and putting on one of her sweetest&#xD;
smles, exclaimed&#xD;
"Why, Clra, dear, what is the-matter? I was only joking."&#xD;
Clara replied, calmly, "Take care, Juilia, that you don't try&#xD;
sauh jokes on me once too often. Have a. care.4&#xD;
It was now Julia's turn'to be calm.' She asked who was to&#xD;
pay a debt that Rose -owed her?&#xD;
"Come, Julia," said Clara. "If you will send all Rose's&#xD;
things to my room, I will pay you out of my own purse. You"&#xD;
shall not lose by my carelessness. RHeally, had I known that&#xD;
Rose was such a valuable little package, I should have been&#xD;
more careful. Now be a good woman, and go get Rose's things&#xD;
packed. How much is her debt ?"&#xD;
"1Forty dollars," replied the somewhat mollified Brown.&#xD;
"W will pay it when I have her trunks,; and now I think of&#xD;
itI will-go and see Rose's things picked up and packed, and&#xD;
have hetrunks placed i$ my room ;" and she tripped out of&#xD;
the room. Could she have heard the curses hurled at her by&#xD;
Aulia when sh'e had left the room, she would have hugged her&#xD;
small dagger more closely.&#xD;
The trunks of Rose were packed and placed in Clara's par-&#xD;
lor.* Then she sent for a carriage to be at No. 100 after din'&#xD;
ner. She and Walter dined together, and then had the trunks&#xD;
of Rose placed in the carriage. The driver had his instrue-I&#xD;
tions, and the couple entered and were driven to. the North&#xD;
American, Hotel, in the Bowery.&#xD;
They found Mr. and Mrs.- Robinson's names on the book,&#xD;
and were shown to their room. Rose was very grateftil, and&#xD;
ordered upfher trunks. Walter and Henry Robinson left the&#xD;
ladies together, and went down into the sitting-room, and had&#xD;
a cosy chat about matters.&#xD;
"   hope, ,Robinson," said Henry, "that I shall. soon see&#xD;
,some opening in New York. I will never go to sea any more."'&#xD;
"Indeed, and by the way,. what are you going to do with&#xD;
that little girl Rose," asked Walter.&#xD;
Sayve her from destruction, if I can, and become steady&#xD;
myself. And you, Walter, what are you going to do with&#xD;

plied Robinson.&#xD;
Soon after Clara and Walter reteirned to Julia Brown's.&#xD;
That lady was ripe for a row. She had heard of Clara'spro.&#xD;
ceedings, and the course she had pursued-with the sailor WalI(&#xD;

I wish you to quitM these premises, Miss Clara as soon as&#xD;
you find it convenient. I won't have sueh carryings-on' You&#xD;
put yourself up-you make out yourself -a lady, and 'put on&#xD;
airs. Hoity-toity, what a long tail our pussy cat has got!- Get&#xD;
out !" exclaimed Mrs. Brown, choking with indignation.&#xD;
"Leave my room, madam, instantly 1" said Clara, for it was&#xD;
in her parlor that this. .scene occurred.&#xD;
I will leave your parlor--my parlor, that is. I don't asw&#xD;
sociate with picked-up common sailors, I don't," replied the&#xD;
indignant Brown.&#xD;
A decanter hurled by Walter at the head of the sauey land-&#xD;
lady, and which dashed to pieces against the wall, brought the&#xD;
dialogue to an end, and Mrs. Brown made good 'her retreat,&#xD;
threatening police, and all sorts, of vengeance.&#xD;
Clara rang the bell. It was answered, and she a second4ime&#xD;
ordered a carriage, and then told themessenge to say to Mrt.&#xD;

The money was paid. It took some time to pack tp all the&#xD;
articles of apparel belonging to Miss Clara, but at last it woa&#xD;
completed, with Walter's assistance.  The baggage almost&#xD;
loaded down the coach, and when Clara and Walter entered it,&#xD;
they had barely room to seat themselves.&#xD;
" Where now ?" asked the driver.&#xD;
.Clara replied "Bond street," and gave him a card.&#xD;
Walter made no observation until the carriage stopped at au&#xD;

any circumstances,. was a welcome apparition. He carried&#xD;
thither sunshine and happiness. Hia two children were de-&#xD;
 lighted, and aealm peace Aiffused itself through the bosom of&#xD;
that mother. Mi s Jane McPherson was, an extraordinary&#xD;
woman. She was Scotch, had many of the prejudices and opin-&#xD;
ions of the Scotch people; she worshipped Mao Neil, and re-&#xD;
garded his proud family and his descent as some thing so su-&#xD;
perior to her own, that' she never blamed him for not marrying&#xD;
her, hut framed excuses in her own heart for his conduct. Hecr&#xD;
soul was given to him and his children.- If she sometimes&#xD;
prayed that he might marry her, it was not from selfish con-&#xD;
siderations, or from. the thought that her position would be&#xD;
more respectable. It was because, in her simple way of think-&#xD;
ing, if the Colonel- was her husband, he would live in the house&#xD;
with her and the'children, and she would be able to nurse,'&#xD;
tended care for him in sickness.&#xD;
Tothe children he was affectionate and. tender, and showed&#xD;
tore Ma-rked kindness than -if they had been legitimate. Both&#xD;
were attending the free schoolin North Moore street, and were&#xD;
making rapid progress in their studies.. In these studies tieo&#xD;
Colonel took a deep' interest, and encouraged them to be pur.&#xD;
sued on every visit. - He never failed to bring,. them  presents&#xD;
of any thing that he. thought they would like, and scarcely a&#xD;

week passed that he did not send then! a sufficiency ofthe best&#xD;
of provisions for their maintenance. He would not suffer Jane to&#xD;
broach the subject of money. He had not drawn a dollar from&#xD;
their little fund since he made the settlement- upon-her. On&#xD;
the contrary, he had added to it, at one time; eight hundred&#xD;
dollars,' and in mall sums -to the extent of twos hundred_ dol-&#xD;
lars. more. On the occasion of Uhis visit, Colonel Mae Neil&#xD;
was unusually kind id affectionate.- He kissed the young&#xD;
people fondly, and to Miss Jane he seemed" perfectly devoted.&#xD;
The good woman eet out the table, and prepared a-pleast&#xD;
spread for him. Soon after the Colonel made his appearance,&#xD;
different porters arrived with things he had boughtthat he was&#xD;
unable to bring himself: All seemed 'happy, but Miss Jane&#xD;
felt a gloom that she could not account for. She had a pre-&#xD;
sentiment of evil, and.it was increased when the tea, was over,&#xD;
and the Colonel'handed her a package.&#xD;
"Jane," said the Colonel, "we are all liable to die and&#xD;
have thought it best to write out an order for my few things in&#xD;
case of any accident ever happening to me. ; I have a valuable&#xD;
bureau...-old family papers' in it-that some day I want my son&#xD;
to have. It is in the rear of No. 46 Centre street. The owner&#xD;
of that store has rooms in his house to-rent. I occupy a Ismall&#xD;
one, and in it are personal matters that I want to, become; my&#xD;
son's. I have written all about these matters in'the letter I&#xD;
now give you. Should I die, I think it would be better that&#xD;
you move out of New York. It is a bad place. You do not&#xD;
know who to trust, and a lone, unprotected woman has a hard&#xD;
time of it,--or if you do not choose to do that, send for yur&#xD;
father to come to New York. The old man would not refuse&#xD;
to do so when I am, dead and out of the way. But :mind, I do&#xD;
*not wish to advise you against your owngood common sense."&#xD;
While the Colonel was -delivering this melancholy address,&#xD;
Miss Jane placed both hands to her face and wept.&#xD;
The Colonel kindly observed,  Don't be'so- foolish, Jane.&#xD;
I have got todie some day, and I say these unpleasant things&#xD;
now, forthey have got to be said some day, and it may'as well&#xD;
be done first as last. With my letter to you: and to the ohl-&#xD;
dreA in your possession, I feel relieved-. am rid of an un-&#xD;
pleasant duty," and as if to confirm his wordasthe Colonel be-&#xD;
gan to be quite merry. He told anbcdotes, sanga few songs,&#xD;
and when he said he must go, it seemed as though the children&#xD;
would not let him do so. ' Poor Colonel Mac' Neil.Rlie',kissed&#xD;
them all affectionately, and~ left the house. It was'uear~eleven&#xD;

"There, sir, that must do for you-; and you, Sissy," for so he&#xD;
called his daughter, "you must have some, too,"-and'he&#xD;
handed her an equal sum.&#xD;
"4But Popsy, you have none left for yourself," exclaimed&#xD;
Willy.&#xD;
"Yes, I have over twenty dollars, and that is all I need to-&#xD;
day, and if I get short to-morrow I will come and borrow of you&#xD;
rich folks, e ?" replied the father&#xD;
This had occurred before he left 27 Harrison street, and as&#xD;
we mentioned before, when he got into the street, the Colonel&#xD;
knew that it was -nearly eleven o'clock. He walked up to&#xD;
Franklin street, and stopped for a moment to get a glass of&#xD;
brandy in at Thomnas, Riley's Fifth Ward Hotel. Then he&#xD;
passed across to Centre street, walking on the north side of&#xD;
franklin. Little did poor. Mac fear, that there was an enemy&#xD;
on his track, watchig every movement, and all for the purpose&#xD;
of secring his watch and the inoney he was supposed to have&#xD;
about his person.  But the Colonel's thoughts were of the&#xD;
scene he had left, of the dear spot where he -had spent the&#xD;
evening. 'He passed Elm     street, and was opposite the*&#xD;
Tombs, on the side -where the arsenal yard then stoo4  -He,&#xD;
felt a blow, and stars sparkled in his-eyes, and he remembered&#xD;
nomore. The first recollection after this was of partly lying&#xD;
on a wet sidewalk close to the board fence. The rain was&#xD;
pouring in torrents. It was pitch .dark. The Tombs loomed&#xD;
up opposite to him, and he only recognized that massive&#xD;
Egyptian architecture by the light of the lamp over the Frank..&#xD;
liii street entrance. The Colonel was- Imazed. He remained&#xD;
still for some time, and tribd to recollect what had happened.&#xD;
"I must have fallen down; but it did not rain when I was&#xD;
walking. .It is very queer. I certainly was not drunk'; -and&#xD;
where ir my hat ? It must be after eleven o'clock. I will&#xD;
hurry oni to' Harry's place. He may not have shut up yet."&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
313-&#xD;
&#xD;
These were his thoughts. With great difficulty he stood upon&#xD;
his feet. He could not find his hat. This annoyed him. The&#xD;
idea of Colonel Mac Neil doing- such a shocking thing as to&#xD;
walk through the street without his hat worried him extremely.&#xD;
He had never had such a disrespectable affair occur during a&#xD;
long life. He felt confident of one thing ; he had not been so&#xD;
drunk as not to know what he was about. Then he kept on to&#xD;
Centre street. He walked-walked-and turned and looked&#xD;
about him. Not a store was open, not a light visible, save the&#xD;
lamps of the street. His head felt queer, "hut- he kept on.&#xD;
Again and again did he stop and look about him. Not a place,&#xD;
or corner, or house could he recognize. At last be came to an&#xD;
open spot. It still rained, but as it poured upon his head, the&#xD;
Colonel seemed relieved. Then he found himself close to an&#xD;
iron railing, and he sat down upon the stone foundation.  "I&#xD;
ought to know this spot," he exclaimed, aloud. Just, then, di-&#xD;
rectly over-his head,' pealed out the deep tones of a bell.&#xD;
" One " " two," " three," " four," "five," he counted, and the&#xD;
bell ceased to strike, an'its dying' notes vibrated off into the&#xD;
upper air. "As I live, that is St. John's Church.- This is&#xD;
the park, and it is five o'clock. Great God! what is the matter&#xD;
with me?   This is the most singular thing that ever happened&#xD;
to me in my life. I will go to some hotel, for I feel weak."&#xD;
He arose with difficulty, and tottered towards Hudson street.&#xD;
Here he recognized his whereabouts, and he-turned down town.&#xD;
When he reached Harrison street, he. recognized that street&#xD;
"Ah ! there are my loved ones. I -will go there; but no, I&#xD;
won't do it, either, poor things."  Even in that hour of dis-&#xD;
tress, sick, wet to the skin, without a hat, he preferred to suf-&#xD;
fer himself rather than discompose Jane or disturb the rest of&#xD;
his children. He turned up Chambers street, and walked&#xD;
slowly across to Centre street. It was becoming lighter every&#xD;
moment, and as he reached the store No. 46 Centre street,&#xD;
Jemmy,'the clerk, was opening the front door. The Colonel&#xD;
got inside 'and grasped a chair.&#xD;
" What do you want ?"' exclaimed Jemmy.&#xD;
" My God, Jemmy, it is me, Colonel .Ma  .Neil."&#xD;
In a moment Jemmy closed the door and lit one of the gas.&#xD;
lights, and thOn as he gazed at the hatless Colonel, he eqx-&#xD;
claimed, "Gracious Heaven, Colonel, what has happened.?"&#xD;
"Really, JemmY, nothing particular. I've lost my hat some-&#xD;
how," replied the Colonel.&#xD;
" Why, you -are covered with blood. You lip is cut: open,&#xD;
and your hair, Colonel, is filled -with blood."&#xD;

"I am faint, Jemmy. Give me a glass of spirits-any thing,''&#xD;
said the'exhausted man.&#xD;
In a moment it was procured and drank.&#xD;
Examine me, Jemmy, and see what is the matter."&#xD;
Jemmy examined his head. In the back were two deep cuts,&#xD;
from which. the Colonel must have bled freely. Three front&#xD;
teeth had'been knocked out,,and the under lip was laid open,&#xD;
and fell down almost to the chin. Jemmy told him all this,&#xD;
and went and procured a glass, in which the Colonel could see&#xD;
reflected his ghastly, bloody appearance.&#xD;
I have had a severe fall."&#xD;
Fall, Colonel!, You have been knocked down. Where is&#xD;
your money ?"&#xD;
The Colonel attempted to put his bands in his vest pockets.&#xD;
They were turned inside out. Not a cent was about him.&#xD;
SI have been-robbed," he exclaimed. "Knocked down and&#xD;
robbed. -That is it, is it not, Jemmy ? Well, I am thankful&#xD;
that I have not brought myself into such a disrespectable po-&#xD;
sition by being drunk."&#xD;
Had you much money about you, Colonel ?" asked Jemmy,&#xD;
who exhibited the deepest sympathy for the Colonel's misfor.&#xD;
tunes, and who had ever- treated him with the greatest res&#xD;
pect.&#xD;
"I had, Jemmy, over a hundred and twenty dollars and my&#xD;
gold watch and chain last night."&#xD;
And all is gone, Colonel ?" extlaimed Jemmy.&#xD;
No. Hang the rascal or rascals, they got bit, Temmy-&#xD;
I left my watch with some dear friends, and a hundred dollars&#xD;
of 'my money also, so that I have. only been robbed of about&#xD;
twenty dollars. Curse them,".said the Colonel, who seemed&#xD;
pleased that he had done the pickpockets out of some plunde&#xD;
Do you suspect any one, Colonel ?" asked Jemmy.&#xD;
I ? not one. No body that I know would rob me."&#xD;
Who was with you last yesterday, in this place ?"&#xD;
"The Count Falsechinski, Monck and O'Doemall."&#xD;
Did any one of them know that-you had money, Colonel?&#xD;
asked Jemrny.&#xD;
"To be sure they did. Two of them gave me what I had -&#xD;
and they certainly would not rob me of it," said Mac Neil,&#xD;
"Not likely; and the third one, Colonel, was Mr. O'Doemall&#xD;
You -yourself called him a scamp yesterday, and ordered him&#xD;
out of the store. He saw that Count hand you the money. I&#xD;
willbet all the money I have in the world, that Mr. O'Doemall&#xD;
&#xD;
314&#xD;
&#xD;
was the man who knocked you down and robbed you," ex-&#xD;
claimed Jemmy.&#xD;
"Pooh! pooh ! Jemmy. That can't be. John O'Doemall is&#xD;
a hard case, but he would not commit a robbery. Besides, how&#xD;
could he know where I was to be found last night at eleven&#xD;
o'clock " exclaimed Colonel Mac Neil.&#xD;
" Well, Colonel, there is no proof of it, butiny opinion can-&#xD;
not be easily shaken, that the fellow O'Doemall robbed you&#xD;
last night; but I must open and put the store to rights," said&#xD;
Jemmy,&#xD;
e AndI, Jemmy, will go and change my dirty linen and&#xD;
wash up."&#xD;
When the Colonel got back to his bureau and the glass, he&#xD;
discovered that he was severely hurt, and the wounds pained&#xD;
him extremely. He washed, changed his linen, arranged his&#xD;
hair, and even while performing these operations, he called to&#xD;
Jemmy to b-ring him a glass of brandy and sugar.&#xD;
It had now become broad daylight. The rain had cleared&#xD;
off, and the sun was up. It was a beautiful day.- Presently&#xD;
Harry, the proprietor, entered the store. He was the Colonel's&#xD;
old porter, and he was much attaclfed to him. He heard- the&#xD;
Colonel relate what had happened, and his sympathy was so&#xD;
much excited that he went at once to a physician and brought&#xD;
him to the store. The doctor shed up the -lip with a single&#xD;
stitch. He dressed the wounds iM the back of the Colonel's&#xD;
head, but the Colonel continued to grow worse, and he felt&#xD;
very weak. He drank again, and then Harry called his atten-&#xD;
tion to the fact in this manner.&#xD;
"Colonel, we are old friends, and Iadvise you to let -up a&#xD;
little. You have received two or three very ugly wounds,&#xD;
you have a great deal of liquor in your system, and I afraid&#xD;
that you will bring on inflammation of the brain or some other&#xD;
thing, unless you give way a little."&#xD;
The Colonel for once was cowed. He was not himself, and&#xD;
was frightened.&#xD;
" I know, Harry, all you would say. I feel as though I shall&#xD;
have a fit of the horrors. I want to stop drinking, God knows,&#xD;
but I can't. I must'drink this morning. - See how my very&#xD;
hand shakes, and yet I have drank four glasses of brandy this&#xD;
morning. . Try and get me some thing that will lie on my&#xD;
stomach. Make me an egg nogg., and put three raw eggs in it.&#xD;
Don't be alarmed, Harry. I have drank so much recently,&#xD;
that all-I can get down- now will not make me intoxiegited. It&#xD;
, only brings mpe up to an even keel. I am drinking up ondd&#xD;

liquor. If I were to knock off suddenly, I should die," said&#xD;
the Colonel.&#xD;
Harry went and procured the egg nogg, and Mac Neil got&#xD;
it down.&#xD;
"Now Mac Neil," said the good-natured rumseller, "'don't&#xD;
drink any more for some time."&#xD;
"I will not-indeed I will not'; I will keep quiet," said the&#xD;
Colonel-and he honestly intended to do so.&#xD;
It was nearly nine o'clock before Marior Monck-arrived. He&#xD;
too had drank to excess the evening previous, and went at&#xD;
once to the bar to procure 'a hair of the dog that had bitten&#xD;
him'-in other words, to get a mint julep. Hes had just finished&#xD;
drinking it when Jemmy pointed out the Colonel in the rear&#xD;
of the store, and told him what had happened. Marion was&#xD;
shocked, and went at once to the Colonel, who appeared very&#xD;
glad to see him.&#xD;
"I am very ill, Marion," said he, in a low tone of voice. "I&#xD;
feel I am getting worse eVery hour."&#xD;
"Any thing that I can do to relieve you, Colonel Mac Neil,&#xD;
I will do cheerfully and willingly. Here comes Mr. Charles."&#xD;
The latter approached, and after expressing his sympathy,&#xD;
exclaimed,&#xD;
"Colonel, you must be attended to without delay.-. You are&#xD;
in a bad state; why not allows to take you to the hospital ?"&#xD;
"The, hospital ! - why, Ply dear fellow, I have a horror&#xD;
of that place ; but perhaps you' are right.  CanI have a&#xD;
room there ?" asked the Colonel.&#xD;
"Certingly.  Good physician, good nurse, and all that sort&#xD;
of thing. It will only cost twelve dollars to enter, and 1 don't'&#xD;
think you will be there a week. A few days' nursing will&#xD;
bring you around all right," replied Charley.'&#xD;
" But the money, man! I was robbed last night, and have&#xD;
none left."&#xD;
" Not a word about that. I have plenty, and will go at once&#xD;
to the hospital and make arrangements for your reception.&#xD;
know them all up there, and it will be all right," exclaimed&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
"Good boy--fine boy. Do as you please ;'nd Charley, you&#xD;
will remain with me ; doi't leave me till I go up there, eh.?"&#xD;
was the Colonel's request.&#xD;
"No, old fellow, I will stay by you; never say die.  You&#xD;
are worth a dozen dead men yet," said Charles.&#xD;
" Charles, you are experienced. I have a dread of having&#xD;
the delirium tremens-a horrible dread of it Now if I go to&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
the hospital, and they cut me off short with ted, . God knows&#xD;
what will become of me. If they let me taper off-give me a&#xD;
little now and then, to keep the nerves braced, I think I shall&#xD;
get over it, eh ?" pleadingly put in poor Mae, who was awfully&#xD;
seared, and well he might be.&#xD;
"They know just what to do up at the hospital; have no&#xD;
,fear, Colonel. But here comes Marion. Well, what suc-&#xD;
cess ?" asked Charles.&#xD;
"I have paid the -twelve dollars, informed Mr. Roberts&#xD;
about you, and at any moment when you are ready to go, we&#xD;
will accompany you. You need not take any things, for I will&#xD;
come and see you every day," replied Marion.&#xD;
The Colonel drew a long sigh, then cast a look at the bu-&#xD;
reau, and exclaimed, "Good bye, old mahogany. I don't&#xD;
know that I am doing right. I feel bad, and sadly perplexed.&#xD;
I have an idea  hat 1 shall never see this place or my old bu-&#xD;
reau again. I will die game, though, if I am to die-but I&#xD;
must have a drink before I start. Jemnmy, make a stiff glass&#xD;
of old brandy and sugar. Suppose you all join me--who knows&#xD;
but it may be my last drink 1"&#xD;
The drinks were taken all round. Harry the proprietor ap-&#xD;
proved highly of the course that the Colonel had determined&#xD;
to pursue. He was afraid that he should have trouble, and he.&#xD;
had no idea but that the hospital was the best plee for the&#xD;
Colonel under the circumstances. All hands talked cheeringly&#xD;
to the desponding Colonel, until at last he felt cheered up him.&#xD;
self. He shook hands with all except Marion and Mr. Charles,&#xD;
who were to accompany him to the hospital, see him safe in-&#xD;
side his room, and then return.&#xD;
They reached the open gate on Broadway, and the  Colonel&#xD;
halted for a moment, and looked up and. down the street as&#xD;
though he expected to see some one. Then as he passed the&#xD;
inner gate where the gate-keeper's house is, Mac observed, "I&#xD;
hope my case in entering this gate is not like one of those&#xD;
where 'he who enters here leaves hope behind,' eh ? I hope&#xD;
I am not in that category, Marion ?"&#xD;
Marion replied soothingly--and yet he felt embarrassed. He&#xD;
did not know that he was doing right, and he could, not make&#xD;
up his mind, that he was doing wrong. If, for 'a moment, "the&#xD;
least idea had flashed across his mind, he would have faced&#xD;
about and taken the Colonel back to 46 Centre street. The&#xD;
party reached the office, and directions were given to conduct&#xD;
Colonel Mac Neil to a certain ward. ~A nurse was sent for,&#xD;
and he led the way, followed by the three, persons. When&#xD;

they reached the right ward the nurse opened the door, and all&#xD;
entered. The door closed, and Marion noticed that it locked&#xD;
itself.&#xD;
The Colonel, as soon as he saw where he was, exclaimed,&#xD;
"Why, this is not a single room! I am not going to remain&#xD;
here !"&#xD;
The nurse replied readily, "Oh, certainly not. We will&#xD;
have a room ready for the gentleman presently. He can&#xD;
remain here for the present, and he had betterlie down for a&#xD;
moment." -This was said kindly, and 'the Colonel, who was&#xD;
completely exhausted, observed,&#xD;
"Well, I will lay down a moment. Marion, Charles, you&#xD;
need not remain. I may sleep a moment. Come back to-;nor-&#xD;
row, Marion-.-hear ?"&#xD;
Marion said he would do so. The nurse applied a key to the&#xD;
door, opened it, and as the two passed into the hall the door&#xD;
closed and locked.again. "I am not exactly pleased with all-&#xD;
this business. Why is not the Colonel's room ready ?" asked&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
"Nonsense. le will have no room except that or the inner&#xD;
lock-up. Why, that is the delirium tremens ward, and there&#xD;
Mac will be kept until he dies or gets over it," coolly replied&#xD;
Mr. Charles.&#xD;
" Good God. -You don't mean to say there is.any danger of&#xD;
his dying of delirium ?" asked Marion.&#xD;
"He is pretty near it. He will have the delirium  tremens&#xD;
most certainly:' He may die. He may not, But he may asiwell&#xD;
die in that room as in the street. Besides, with all the rum&#xD;
he-has got in his blood, and the bad cuts upgn his head, he&#xD;
will have a bad time of it,' said Mr. Charles.&#xD;
When the two reached Broadway, they separated.&#xD;

friends who had re-rallied about him. le had not been in the&#xD;
city of New York many days before ha fully realized the con-&#xD;
'trast between holding an official position, having plenty of-&#xD;
money, and recognized by respectable relatives, ad the loss&#xD;
of all these advantages. How he lived, no man but himself&#xD;
ever knew. He managed sometimes to make a few shillings&#xD;
by singing at a garden concert, or a free concert in some by&#xD;
street. He went to such places and performed under an as-&#xD;
suied name. He might have used his real one ; no one would&#xD;
have troubled his head about him. Sometimes Tom wasalmbst&#xD;
in despair: for he really suffered. He went to haunts fre-&#xD;
quented by old friends and acquaintances. There he could&#xD;
always obtain a drink, and nibble a crackers and cheese.  As&#xD;
days passed on, matters grew worse, instead of better. It was&#xD;
rare that Tom Granville had over a quarter. He had no regu-&#xD;
lar place to sleep, but found-a bed in some lodging. If he had&#xD;
three shillings, he went to Tammany Hall. If only a quarter,&#xD;
to a neat lodging-house in Pearl street, near Broadway.,If&#xD;
only a shilling, Tom went to a lodging-house in Chatham street,&#xD;
near Duane. There he got a ld in a room where several oth-&#xD;
ers slept, and Tom had to be satisfied. It was .better than&#xD;
sleeping in the Park, or walking the streets in a Old winter&#xD;
night. Sometimes Tom would be the delight of an audience&#xD;
in allow bar-room where liquor was sold for threeent a glass,&#xD;
and his droll stories in a-dark room in a lodging-house to the&#xD;
other queer lodgers in the various beds, would make the. occu-&#xD;
pants scream with laughter, and their first questions at day-&#xD;
break would be for the funny man who had told stories or sang&#xD;
songs in the dark the night previous.  What a happy disposi-&#xD;

kept by Peter Melville. There were several loafers -around&#xD;
the stove, for it was a bitter cold night. Tom knew them all,&#xD;
but not one had a cent, and business was at a dead stand. The&#xD;
excellent Melville showed symptoms of closing up. Torn was&#xD;
dry. He was as dry as a pump is said tobe when there is not&#xD;
a drop of water in it.. He determined to have one more drink,&#xD;
anyhow. The landlord, looked untrusting. Tom drew near the&#xD;
bar.&#xD;
"My lord Melville, will you give me a glass of your most&#xD;
excellent, I might-say exquisite whiskey 1"&#xD;
"IHave you got the mogey to pay for it, Tom ?" asked the&#xD;
proprietor.4&#xD;
"1 Excellent Melville, I regret to say I have not, but assur.&#xD;
edly, if you will trust me until this hour to-morrow, by Her.&#xD;
cules, the three cents shall be in your hands," said Tom.&#xD;
"I won't do it," replied Melville.&#xD;
"Inexorable Melville, say not so. Remember, worthy son&#xD;
of the land where 'Wallace bled, that ' 'Tis a little thing to give&#xD;
a glass of Scotch whiskey. But its draught of warm refresh.&#xD;
ment, drained by chilled lips, will give a shock of  pleasure to&#xD;
the frame more exquisite than when wine its nectarine riches&#xD;
pours;' Ah, stern man, -pour out one glass,.. for poor Tom's&#xD;
a-col."&#xD;
The comic look which Tom gave the keeper, as he pro.&#xD;
bounced these words, upset ,the Scotchman's gravity.  Ie&#xD;
handed over the decanter to Tom, and told him to help himself.&#xD;
"But no more, Tom, to-night," he added. Ton drank off the&#xD;
wine, and then continued, "''Tis a little thing to speak a word&#xD;
of kindness, but falling upon the ear of him who thought-4o die&#xD;
unmourned, it sounds like gentlest music.' You have spoken&#xD;
that word to me, my Melville, and I thank you. Good night,"&#xD;
-and Tom felt in his pocket to see that his shilling was safe&#xD;
to pay for his lodging, and then hurried out into the cold air to&#xD;
go and seek his lodging-house. He paid his shilling and hast-&#xD;
ened up to the room, where he found a dozen men in different&#xD;
beds. . He selected one that was unoccupied, and was soon fast&#xD;
asleep., In the morning, he was up by daylight, for he was&#xD;
almost crazy to get a drink of water-grog---any thing.' Ile&#xD;
hastened down stairs. There was a bar in the room, and pie&#xD;
was kept upon a plate at one end of it. The boy was dressing&#xD;
when Tom came down.&#xD;
"I'll let you out in a moment, Mister," he said.&#xD;

of Astor. Later that morning. customers began to arrive, and&#xD;
Jemmy had to go behind,the-bar, leaving Tom puffing a cigar&#xD;
at the stove, and seemingly quite happy. Just then custome.z&#xD;
of a di erent character entered the place, approached the bar,&#xD;
and ordered a drink;  He wore a fur cap and a bearskin over-&#xD;
coat. He had partly finished the drink he had ordered when&#xD;
his eyes rested upon the pleasant face of Tom,&#xD;
"Great God ! it cannot be possible !" he exclaimed,. and then,&#xD;
with the glass in his hand, wont and sat hiinself in a chair next&#xD;
to Tom Granville. "Excuse me, sir, but is not your name&#xD;
Thomas Granville ?" asked the stranger.'&#xD;
"I was once Sir Thomas Granville, Esquire. I am   now&#xD;
Tom Granville, or plain Tom, at your :service,"-and a comic&#xD;
smile played over his expressive features.&#xD;
"When have you seen your brother Pitt Granville ?" the&#xD;
stranger asked.&#xD;
"Pitt--yes--my brother Pitt. Oh, it is a long time since I&#xD;
have seen Pitt, but it is much longer since he has seen me,"&#xD;
sMd Tom, with feeling.&#xD;
"Then you and your brother have quarrelled, eh ?"&#xD;
" No, sir. I never quarrel with my brother. He has, for&#xD;
good reasons, I dare say, done with me. That is his business;&#xD;
not ours, sir," said-Tom.&#xD;
"Suppose you join me in a drink, Mr. Granville,"&#xD;
"Mr. -Granville!  Certingly,. with pleasure.  Jemmy--a&#xD;
glass of het toddy--my private bottle, you understand. I am&#xD;
mIuch obliged to you, sir," said Tom-.&#xD;
4 You once had a nephew, Walter Granville, what has be.-&#xD;
come of him ?" the stronger continued.&#xD;
"Ah, there you touch me. A fine iboy-.a noble boy.--gone&#xD;
tp sea., Unheard of for years. Dead probably. The good&#xD;
aye die young.  A family affair, sir.  Here is to your very,&#xD;
good health," said Tom; Had he- noticed the stranger, he&#xD;
would have observed that he appeared to be very much af.-&#xD;
fected.&#xD;
" Your own wife, Mr. Granville, where is she ?" asked the&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
"I Baltimore, living with her grandmother. She is di.&#xD;
vorced from me," replied Tom.&#xD;
"So I have heard. What ever became of one of her sis.&#xD;
ters ?" asked the stranger.&#xD;
"Which one? She had several," asked Tom.&#xD;
"Madison Pinckney," said the stranger, with feeling.&#xD;
"Oh ; she married a young fellow named Charles Wharton, .&#xD;
&#xD;
(q&#xD;

VIGOR.                     S2&#xD;
and has moved to Colaiuhus, Ohio. A very good match, I a m&#xD;
told. Have you got any more questions to ask? If you have,&#xD;
propel ahead. I am ready to answer to the best of my ability,"&#xD;
observed Tom.&#xD;
" No; I have no more to ask about your family. I have one&#xD;
to ask about yourself. Suppose, Mr. Granville, that I, a stra-&#xD;
ger, should say to you, 'Mr. Granville, go with me to different&#xD;
stores. Buy an overcoat, a coat, a vest, a pair of pantaloons, a&#xD;
pair of boots, a new hat, shirts,. underclothes, socks, a necktie,&#xD;
nd any thing else that a-gentleman needs, and I will pay for&#xD;
them,' what would you reply? and what would you think of me&#xD;
when I, as I do now, make you such an offer    . said the&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
"I should say yes, and I should think that you were. a par-&#xD;
ticular d-----d fool," replied honest Ton.&#xD;
"Perhaps I should be; but why do you think so, Mr, Gran-.&#xD;
ville ?" pleasantly asked the stranger.&#xD;
"Because, sir, I am poor. I am dead broke. I dont have&#xD;
food half of the time. How long do you think, under such cir-&#xD;
cumstances, I should keep my good clothes? Why sir, in less&#xD;
than a week, or a month at most, those articles woul4 all go to&#xD;
a pawnbroker, and I should fall back upon the old rags, sir.&#xD;
That is truth-don't you think it is, Jenuiy ' said Tom as lIe&#xD;
aprealed to Jem, who had been an attentive listener ,or some&#xD;
.Moments.&#xD;
"It may be, but if the gentleman makes you the ofer I&#xD;
would accept it. It won't do you any harm to do        sa&#xD;
Jemmy.&#xD;
The stranger rose. "Come, Mr. Granville, and go witi me.&#xD;
When you have all these things I have named, then we must&#xD;
try and get some money, or food, or a place to beard. One&#xD;
things at a time. Will you go'?" he asked.&#xD;
" I will--but first let me ask who you are ?"' said Tom.&#xD;
"Call me Smith, until we are better acquainted," replied&#xD;
the-stranger.&#xD;
"Well Smith, you are a devilish good-looking y'ung  * foow,&#xD;
but decidedly mad. I will go with you."&#xD;
The parties left the place, and left a wondering set f people&#xD;
in it. Jemmy the bar-keeper was the most astonished -ofaU.&#xD;
*He could not make it out.anhirid&#xD;
It was near midday before Tom .Grannille' adhs fi&#xD;
Smith returned to 46 Centre street Thomas Grauville wa a&#xD;

.the finest quality. The stranger evidently did not do things&#xD;
by halves. -lHe ordered drinks for all in the room. When&#xD;
they had been taken, he said to Thomas Granville, "Now sir,&#xD;
I will bid you good-bye ; but I will meet you at your hotel&#xD;
this evening at precisely seven o'clock. Remember what you&#xD;
have promised, and don't break it. Good-bye."&#xD;
Tom shook his head, and after he had left, he observed to&#xD;
Jemmy, "That chap is mad--quite mad."&#xD;
"4What did he mean by your hotel, eh ?" asked Jemmy.&#xD;
"  Mean ?. Why I am  stopping at a hotel. It is Tigin's&#xD;
French Hotel de Paris, corner of Reade street and Broadway,&#xD;
No. 34--best room, in the house. Paid my board- one month&#xD;
in advance, thirty-two dollars--eight dollars a week, eh ? See&#xD;
the receipt. What do you think of that, Jemmy ?" said the&#xD;
delighted Tom.&#xD;
"Who can he be? What was the promise ?" asked Jemmy.&#xD;
"Smith is his name-I promised not to get very drunk, but&#xD;
to be sober at seven o'clock this evening. Bless your heart,&#xD;
I will be as sober as a judge !"r exclaimed the enthusiastic Tom'.&#xD;
"He is a good friend," observed Jemmy.&#xD;
"He gave me- ten dollars, and advised me to pay what I&#xD;
owed, here, or any where else in a small way. How much do&#xD;
I owe you, Jemmy ?" asked Tom.&#xD;
"Not a red cent, Mr. Granville., You are perfectly welcome&#xD;
to what you have had,'' replied Jenimy'&#xD;
"4Thank you, Jemmy. But what a breakfast we had at that&#xD;
French hotel! 0 my! That Smith understands good living-&#xD;
He is a perfect prince," exclaimed Tom.&#xD;
We must now follow the stranger. He had no sooner parted&#xD;
from Thomas Granville, than he turned his course to Bond&#xD;
street, and entered the house of Mrs. Woodruff. He walked&#xD;
up stairs, and entered the front rooi on- the second floor,&#xD;
There was a lady in the room., who rose as he entered. He&#xD;
gave her an affectionate kiss, and observed,,&#xD;
"A thousand thanks, dear Clara,- for enabling me to do a&#xD;
good deed. 0, if you knew how far that- hundred dollars has&#xD;
gone! But sit down, and let me tell you all about poor Tom."'&#xD;
She listened, and he related the particulars of the interview&#xD;
whith our readers are aware of. She wept, and at last observed,&#xD;
"If it will only do any good, I shall be glad. I do it and&#xD;
will do-more-but mind me, Walter, it is for you, not for Tomn.&#xD;
I have come to hate him--'to hate him," she repeated, em-&#xD;

Walter Granville, for he was the stranger that had so electri-&#xD;

"And will Tom come.up here to-night'with you?" she asked.&#xD;
"He will, and.then I will'tell him who -I am, and that I&#xD;
should not have been able to do what I have but for you. Now&#xD;

"I will be in half an hour-remain quiet until then." And&#xD;
she left the room.&#xD;

Rorne.&#xD;
TiosE who pass up and down Broadway in the great city,&#xD;
.must have noticed on its west side the dark, gloomy building &#xD;
known as the "New York Hospital.". Seen from  the street,&#xD;
it looks like some glooniy old castle, with its iron railing, the&#xD;
green lawn, the venerable elms, and the gate-keeper's lodge.&#xD;
It is a pleasant place 'to look at from the outside, and, but few&#xD;
are aware of the horrors that are daily witnessed inside. The&#xD;
stabbed, the accidentally injured, the suicide who has only&#xD;
partly done his work, the almost maniac, on the eve of delrium&#xD;
tremens, pass inside those iron gates without notice or com-&#xD;
ment. Sailors who liave paid United States Hospital money,&#xD;
no matter what may be their disease, are entitled to be received&#xD;
into that hospital free of charge, to the extent of one hundred&#xD;
at a time. The sick or wounded man who can raise twelve&#xD;
dollars to pay the admission fee, can find a home and medical&#xD;
attendance until he is cured by medicine or death. In either&#xD;
case he pays no more than the twelve dollars.&#xD;
In the basement floor of what is called the North building&#xD;
is one large room, capable of holding ifve or six small iron&#xD;
bedsteads. The door has a strong spring lock, and fastens of&#xD;
itself. The large wndow to this room is strongly barred with&#xD;
great stout iron bar  that no human strength can wrensch or&#xD;
tear asunder. There a -e three doors that lead out of this-roomi.&#xD;
One-opens into a cell, rye there is no window. Nothing&#xD;

&#xD;
but four solid walls,-and an iron bedstead. Not an article of&#xD;
furniture else is in this room. Another door leads to a bath&#xD;
room. Here too the windows are barred with iron staunch-&#xD;
ions. Another opens into the nurse's room, and this door also&#xD;
closes with a spring lock, and like the main door, has to be&#xD;
opened with a key. This room or ward is called the delirium&#xD;
tremens ward of the Hospital. Into this are thrust those pa-&#xD;
tients who are brought to the hospital laboring under this fear-&#xD;
ful malady, or when it is suspected that it will break out, from'&#xD;
the fact that the patient has been drinking freely, and has suf-&#xD;
fered' or is suffering from want of sleep4 This is the most&#xD;
fearful ward in the Hospital, and the nurse, as a matter of&#xD;
self-preservation for his oiyn life, and the lives of those en-&#xD;
trUsted to his care, is a man of experience, and perfectly hard-&#xD;
hearted,  He knows no feeling, until actual observation has'&#xD;
convinced him of the danger or absence of it, in a new patient.&#xD;
No mildness, no manner or language 'of a perfect gentleman,&#xD;
no money can disarm for, a moment the fear of the nurse for a&#xD;
new comer. The moment a patient is committed to his ward,&#xD;
he is aware that madness is the main complaint, and he is on&#xD;
the watch for its appearance in any shape or at any moment.&#xD;
His doors are locked. His eyes are as watchful as a cat's.&#xD;
He orders a new patient to undress and go to bed.' Frequently&#xD;
the patient refuses. Force is at once used, and he is placed&#xD;
on the iron bedstead, and every particle of clothing is removed&#xD;
to the nurse's own room. If the patient becomes more obstre&#xD;
porous, he is at once pinioned to the bed, or a straight.jacket&#xD;
put upon him, and a hand chained to each side of the bed. This&#xD;
confinement of itself would almost drive a sane man mad. If&#xD;
the patient becomes raving, then the scene is changed. He&#xD;
is passed into the dark cell, where the solitary iron bedstead&#xD;
is, and where no article of furniture can be found to aid him in&#xD;
self-destruction. Then the patient may yell with horror, or&#xD;
utter screams that thrill the stoutest nerves, or die in madness.&#xD;
The door is strong-the walls are thick, and but little is heard&#xD;
by others, however fearful the agony. Sometimes the patient&#xD;
tires out the patience of the nurse, and then he forgets the&#xD;
rules, and beats his patient into submission until death takes&#xD;
up the cudgels, and finishes what the indignant nurse had only&#xD;
begun.&#xD;
The regular house physician, or the visiting surgeon, never&#xD;
enter this ward without fear, and a full appreciation of.the dan-&#xD;
ger. As a consequence, when a patient is placed in this ward,&#xD;
the very circumstances attending his being there, or the mere&#xD;
&#xD;
Vi oR.                     327&#xD;
fact that le is there, shuts 1 I  out from all human sympathy&#xD;
and kindness. The poor i ebriate who is suffering the horrors&#xD;
of abstinence from drink, ,,ho needs kind words, and eneour-&#xD;
agement, and soothing, gets none in this ward. He sees others&#xD;
chained down to the iron be&amp;amp;ds'-he hears the horrid screams&#xD;
of the one in the dungeon-he sees them die in bedsalongside&#xD;
of his own-he hears the fearful screams until death seals the&#xD;
lips. If he had not the seeds of delirium already in his blood,&#xD;
. all these things, and such horrid surroundings would make&#xD;
him mad. Many hundreds of worthy men, who have died un-&#xD;
lamented in the delirium tremens *ard of the Hospital, might&#xD;
now have been alive and well, had the friends or relations who&#xD;
placed them there have exercised a little forbearance and a&#xD;
little kindness. That treatment of a man who has been drink-&#xD;
ing until his nerves are burning wires, who cannot sleep, which&#xD;
suddenly cuts off the spirit which has caused the difficulty and&#xD;
the danger, and leaves the shattered nerves to sustain the&#xD;
additional horrors of confinement among-madmen, is murder-&#xD;
and such is the practice hourly in the delirium tremens ward&#xD;
of the NeW York Hospital.&#xD;
- Blessed be those gallant, glorious men who have inaugurated&#xD;
a new era in this matter-who have started into existence the&#xD;
"Inebriate Asylum."&#xD;
When Colonel Mac Neil was placed. in the ward we have&#xD;
been describing, and left there by Marion Monek and Air.&#xD;
Charles, he laid down upon one of the iron bedsteads. He&#xD;
dozed for a few moments, and then rose up.&#xD;
"Lie down," said the nurse Patrick,&#xD;
"Who are you addressing-me?     Where is my room, sir?&#xD;
I will not remain here any longer," said the indignant Colonel;&#xD;
and he marched proudly to the door. Of course he found it&#xD;
fastened. "Open the door, sir," he continued.&#xD;
Nurse Patrick went to another door, and called to a sort of&#xD;
assistant. The other man came.&#xD;
" Look here, Colonel, you must take off your clothes and go&#xD;
to bed. We are not going to have none of your nonsense&#xD;
here," said Patrick.&#xD;
" Where is my room, sir p?" asked -the Colonel.&#xD;
"0O, blast you and your room ! This is all the room you wil&#xD;
have in this building. Come, strip, or I'll do it for you," said&#xD;
the nurse, and he approached the Colonel, who stood near the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
" Stand off, I say ! or if you touch me I will make you suirer-&#xD;
for it. I have never heard of such impudence 1"&#xD;

VIGOR'.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Colonel, as he said this, placed himself in an attitude of&#xD;
defence.&#xD;
"Help me, Bill," exclaimed Nurse Patrick; and at the&#xD;
same moment he, suddenly jumped upon the astonished Col.&#xD;
onel. He was overpowered in a twinkling, and the nurse and&#xD;
his assistant flung him on his back upon the vacant bed.&#xD;
This is outrageous !---infamous !-where is the 'Superin-&#xD;
tendent?  I am a gentleman; what do you nean?  Are you&#xD;
going to kill me ?" muttered poor Mac Neil. But it was of no&#xD;
use ; in a moment he was stripped to his shirt; and then his&#xD;
clothes, hat,'boots, and all of his apparel was taken to another'&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"iNow get into bed and keep quiet, or it will be worse for&#xD;
you," said the nurse Patrick.&#xD;
The Colonel saw that resistance was useless; he made no&#xD;
further efforts, but determined to complain to the doctor when&#xD;
he saw him. . There were.other patients in the room, but Mae&#xD;
Neil did not notice them., He lay awake,, and moments seemed&#xD;
hours, but at last the visiting doctors came-wmone old man and&#xD;
two young ones. They sat by the bed, and the -eldest kept&#xD;
examining Mae's wounds. The Colonel began to tell who he&#xD;
was, and to complain of the treatment-.&#xD;
"6You have been drinking, sir, and you are paced here to&#xD;
be cured,-and we will try and cure you; when that is done we&#xD;
shall listen to your complaints. Meantime yoi must try and&#xD;
get some sleep. Your condition, without you, get -sleep, will&#xD;
be a critical-one," said the elder doctor.&#xD;
The Colonel began to realize his position: he asked the&#xD;
doctor if he thought he was really very unwell.&#xD;
"Yes ; you will probably be delirious unless you-get sleep.&#xD;
I will order some medicine that will give you sleep probably.&#xD;
It may not. How long since you have had any sleep ?"&#xD;
The Colonel replied that he had not slept well for several&#xD;
nights.&#xD;
"I am very nervous now,  Could I not have a glass ,of&#xD;
brandy and water ?"&#xD;
The old doctor smiled, and so did his two assistants, and&#xD;
they passed on to the next patient. Soon after they left the&#xD;
ward; -and the nurse, who had received some directions, came&#xD;
to the bedside of the Colonel.&#xD;
"How do you feel now ?" he asked in a kinder tone than&#xD;
usual.I&#xD;
" Very bad indeed. I am really sick. I would like to get&#xD;
up and put on my clothes," said the Colonel.&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
329&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Can't be allowed. You must get some sleep before you&#xD;
are allowed to sit up," replied the nurse.&#xD;
"Then I will try and get some sleep," said poor Mac Neil,&#xD;
le did try, but there was a fire in his veins that would not&#xD;
let him sleep. Tea came; he tried to swallow it, but his&#xD;
nerves were so unstrung that he could not hold the cup to his&#xD;
mouth, and he fell back upon the bed. Then came the long&#xD;
hours of that night. Moments only passed, and yet the Colonel&#xD;
dreamed of horrid matters and doings that would have taken&#xD;
hours to perform. He would start up in his bed, and a cold&#xD;
sweat poured'from his brow. The building seemed'to totter ;&#xD;
the room turned round; the sickly lamp seemed to be glowing&#xD;
meteors. ie would satisfy his mind that all was imagination,&#xD;
and then the horrid thought would cross his Mind that he was&#xD;
goingmad. In a moment more he would doze, and then he&#xD;
would be with his darling children. Oh what happiness! the&#xD;
loved mother was there. Then snakes would come among them&#xD;
-hateful, venomous reptiles, with unheard of forms, and his&#xD;
children would be snatched away, and he would raise himself&#xD;
in bed. "Lie down," the nurse would sing out. All his&#xD;
dreams had been but a moment transpiring.&#xD;
By and bye the nurse would come again. "Take this-tIhe&#xD;
doctor ordered it."  The Colonel hesisated, but took the tea-&#xD;
spoon in his hand, and swallowed' the contents. "Two hours&#xD;
hence you are to take another one," said the nurse. "Now lie&#xD;
down and try to sleep-it is all that you can do, or. that any&#xD;
body can do for you; it is sleep or die." The Colonel would&#xD;
lie down again.  In a moment he saw the doctor slyly enter,&#xD;
and pass to the nurse's room ; he heard them whisper softly&#xD;
to each other. One said, " Yes, I have given him the dose.&#xD;
It will kill him;' then we will take his body up stairs, and no-&#xD;
body will know it; he will make a good subject."  The other&#xD;
replied, "I must not be known in the matter.  He is Colonel&#xD;
Mac Neil. His friends don't care about him while he is alive,&#xD;
but when lie is dead they may ask about him."&#xD;
Mac heard all this dreadful conspiracy. He sat up in. the&#xD;
bed, but there was no one in the room.  "Aha! kill me, will&#xD;
they ?" He jumped out of bed and seized a wooden bench.&#xD;
I will not die without a struggle."&#xD;
The doctor haTd passed through the room, but it was to take&#xD;
a bath ; the nurse was in his own room, occupied with some&#xD;
business, but the poor victim, (for Mae, was now delirious,)&#xD;
thought he had heard all this talk, and he was ready.&#xD;
--The doctor came out of the bath room. No sooner' did MaLo&#xD;

see him, than elevating the stool he exclaimed, "Poison me,&#xD;
you d-d doctor, will ydu ?'' and made a blow with the bench&#xD;
at his head.  Had it hit him, he never would have prescribed&#xD;
for any more patients. The doctor dodged it, but fell.  In a&#xD;
moment the Colonel was upon him. The nurse, hearing the&#xD;
struggle, came in, and at once fastened upon the Colonel,' and&#xD;
choked him until he released the. doctor.  Then more help&#xD;
came, and at last they got the raving man upon the bed, and&#xD;
then passing a chain over him, fastened his hands and legs so&#xD;
that he could not move. "He is safe now, doctor," said the'&#xD;
nurse. "You had a narrow escape, doctor : lucky I came in.&#xD;
I thought we should have 'trouble with him; he has been a&#xD;
hard drinker."1'1&#xD;
"Yes, Patrick, don't let hin -loose again 'until I see you; he&#xD;
is very dangerous. I don't think he will get over it, though&#xD;
he may if he gets sleep to-night," and with these remarks the&#xD;
doctor pag§ed out and got a good night's sleep, leaving orders&#xD;
to keep poor Mac chained until mornipg-&#xD;
The struggles of the Colonel when he found himself made.&#xD;
fast, were fearful. Sometimes it seemed as though he would&#xD;
either break the chain and fastenings, or wrench off his wrists.,&#xD;
His torrents of curses and reproaches were horrible. The other&#xD;
patients who had gone through the ordeal and were getting&#xD;
well, could not sleep, but they sat up ir their beds and watched&#xD;
the run maniac. " For the love of God, take those snakes off&#xD;
my handd" " Oh Graham, you deserved a better fate." "Poor&#xD;
Will! my, bright, beautiful boy.'  "There ! there ! what a&#xD;
horrid snake !"  " Water ! give me water !" these expressions&#xD;
and a thousand others, gave a key to the thoughts which were&#xD;
passing in the poor maniac's mind. Sometimes he would utter&#xD;
scream after scream of agonized horror ; then he would weep&#xD;
as though his heart would break: and so he continued all that&#xD;
night. Towards morning he seemed to be getting quiet.&#xD;
"I am glad of that," said the nurse to his companion.&#xD;
"I thought, Bill, we would have to lock hini up. But he is&#xD;
pretty quiet now, and I am going to have a snooze."&#xD;
" Day broke, and soon after the light came through the large,&#xD;
window, and fell upon the chained man's countenance.. The&#xD;
patient in the next bed appeared to notice something unusual.&#xD;
He observed to another patient, " I believe that man is dying.'&#xD;
It is enough 'to kill any one to be treated so-chained down all&#xD;

The other patient added, " He don't make no noise now. Is&#xD;
he asleep ? Take a look."&#xD;

The other did look, and placed his hand upon the forehead&#xD;
of Colonel Mac Neil. "My God, he is dead. Let us call the&#xD;
nurse."&#xD;
"Don't call him-let hitn find- it out. He knows he will&#xD;
get the gentleman's clothes, and that is all he cares about,"&#xD;
said the other patient,&#xD;
The Colonel lay thus cold -and unconscious, and the other&#xD;
patients soon went to sleep. Later the nurse Patrick entered,&#xD;
and went to the bedside of Mac Neil. "Dead, eh ?" and then&#xD;
he opened the door and went to the office to report. Such&#xD;
things are very common in that old building  The nurse was&#xD;
gone a few moments. When he returned, hl was followed by&#xD;
two other men. They all then assisted to place the body upon&#xD;
a sort of bier, and carried it out of the ward down to the dead&#xD;
house, and then placed it upon the table to await further orders.&#xD;
There was no noise and no fuss at such a melancholy termina-&#xD;
tion to a man's' life in the hospital, as there would have been&#xD;
in a private mansion. No message was sent out to any body,&#xD;
for that is not the business of people in the hospital. People&#xD;
go to the hospital with one of two objects to accomplish-to&#xD;
get well or to die. .Colonel Mac Neil was dead, and if - his&#xD;
friends discovered it well and good ; if not, his body would be&#xD;
taken from the dead house in the hospital yard to the Potter's&#xD;
Field.  About ten o'clock that same day, Marion Monek,&#xD;
agreeably to the promise he had made to the Colonel the day&#xD;
previous went from 46 Centre street to see him. He passed&#xD;
through the gate, and went directly to the ward in the North.&#xD;
building. The door was not fast, but stood partly open. The&#xD;
nurse was not there. Marion gazed around the room, expect-&#xD;
ing to see the Colonel-hut he was not there. He turned&#xD;
towards a patient who occupied a bed near the door: "I came&#xD;
here with a friend yesterday. lHe was placed upon that bed.&#xD;
Can you tell me where he has gone to ?"&#xD;
The man looked at Marion a moment: "Yes, I remember&#xD;
you. They have removed your friend-Colonel you called&#xD;
him-to the dead house."&#xD;
"Dead house! Why, what should he be removed there&#xD;
for ?" asked Marion, horrified.&#xD;
"What for?   Why, because he is dead," replied the man.&#xD;
"Dead. Colonel Mac Neil dead. Impossible. Why, I left&#xD;
him .here yesterday. Dead !" Marion exclaimed, and seemed&#xD;
to be paralyzed at the information. Another patient joined&#xD;
him, who seemed to be a little more human. Hie related all&#xD;
that had occurred, and that the Colonel had died soon after&#xD;

daylight. Marion cried like a child. The nurse came in, and&#xD;
Marion heard whatlie had to say. He then went to the office&#xD;
and obtained permission to go to the dead house and see the&#xD;
body. The dead house man opened the door. There was no&#xD;
mistake now. There lay Colonel Mac Neil, cold, stiff and&#xD;
Insensible to all affairs of earth.- Marion was too shocked to&#xD;
oped his mouth. He hurried out of the building-out of the&#xD;
grounds, and never halted until he reached No. 46 Centre&#xD;
street. Mr. Charles was reading the newspaper.    Marion&#xD;
hastily told the story, namely, that Colonel Mac Neil was dead.&#xD;
Mr. Charles said he expected as much. Harry, the proprietor,&#xD;
at once took an interest in the matter, and advised~ Marion to&#xD;
go to No. 27 Harrison street and communicate the awful intel.-&#xD;
ligence.to Miss Jane. He went over at once. He found that&#xD;
lady just sitting down to dinner with her children. He asked&#xD;
to see her alone. Half reluctantly she came out into the hall.&#xD;
He told her what had happened. One shriek rang out,- and&#xD;
he fell senseless on the floor. But there was no time for delay.&#xD;
" You are Marion Monck, I am certain. Go and make arrange.&#xD;
ments that his body shall be brought here. Poor William  he&#xD;
shall have no burial from a public hospital."  The parties in&#xD;
house were spoken to, and they advised Miss McPherson to&#xD;
pursue that course. The children of the Colonel were very&#xD;
much affected; When the mother told them what had h'.p&#xD;
opened, they sobbed as if their little hearts would break. They&#xD;
did love that poor father who loved them'so truly&#xD;
Marion left them to weep at their great loss, and went to an&#xD;
.undertaker and gave orders to him to take a shell and convey&#xD;
the body of the Colonel to Harrison street, and then to take&#xD;
measures for a handsome coffin and a respectable private burial.&#xD;
He accompanied the undertaker to the hospital. Permission&#xD;
to remove the body was at once obtained, and the unconscious&#xD;
Colonel was with those who loved him that same evening of&#xD;
the day he died. The notice of the death of Colonel Mac&#xD;
Neil appeared in the papers next morning, and the funeral was&#xD;
announced to take place that afternoon.&#xD;

The house of John Grasper, in Broadway- The Wedding-Count Falsechin:-&#xD;
ski is Married to the Rich Irene Graiper-A Startling Contrast-The&#xD;
Brilliant Marriage of one Lover, and the Alancholy Funeral of the Other.&#xD;
IN that brown granite building up Broadway, the residence&#xD;
of John Grasper, iEsq., there was a grand gathering of all the&#xD;
elite of New York city one night late in the month of Septem.&#xD;
ber*. The Count Falsechinski had that day led to the altar'&#xD;
Irene, the handsome daughter of the rich old banker, She wag.&#xD;
now a Countess. The bride and the bridegroom  were both&#xD;
present at this party given by the parents of the bride to cele-&#xD;
brate the nuptials. Music, the rarest and best that could be&#xD;
procured, added liveliness to the scene. What a contrast to&#xD;
the scenetliat same night in the humble dwelling-house in&#xD;
Harrison street! Could the fair- bride, whose brow was un-&#xD;
dimmed by even a passing "sorrow cloud, have realized that her&#xD;
admirer-her lover, fand the one she loved in other days-the&#xD;
gay and fashionable Colonel Mac Neil, had died that morning&#xD;
in a public ward in the hospital, manacled, uncared for, and&#xD;
unknown, and that at that moment, when her father's mansion&#xD;
was illuminated with light and with beauty, and crowds were&#xD;
offering incense at her shrine, he, the poor lover, was lying&#xD;
dead in a small room, and by his.lifeless body knelt a woman&#xD;
and his two children   What would have been the bride's&#xD;
sensations' !We will not stop to inquire.  Such was the fet,&#xD;
however, and it was known to the Count that Colonel Mac Neil&#xD;
was dead, for he had met Marion JMonck, who informed him of&#xD;
it as an excuse why he should be absent from the wedding&#xD;
party, to which the Count had given him a cordial invitation.&#xD;
To the credit of the Count, we will say that he not. -only bade&#xD;
larion God speed in his work. of kindness in assisting the&#xD;
widow and the fatherless, but he insisted that he should receive&#xD;
from him, the Count, a sufficient sum of money to liguidate all&#xD;
expenses copnected with the funeral of Colonel Mae Neil&#xD;
Old Mr. Prime, the banker and the friend of the Count, was&#xD;
at the wedding party, and as merry -as every old gentleman&#xD;

ought to be. He considered this wedding as partly got up by&#xD;
his individual action. He had satisfied Mr. Grasper, and Mr.&#xD;
Grasper had paid into the banking house of Prims, Ward &amp;amp;&#xD;
King the dower agreed upon, namely, one hundred and fifty&#xD;
thousand dollars. The settlements had been made to the en-&#xD;
tire satisfaction of all parties.&#xD;
Among the guests was the Russian Aihbassador, who had&#xD;
undertaken to arrange the Count's affairs at the Court of- St.&#xD;
Petersburg. He had succeeded, and his presence was a fu!Il&#xD;
indorsement of the Count's claim to his  title, had any one&#xD;
chosen to dispute or to doubt the matter. Mr and Mrs. Wil-&#xD;
son were invited, and were present. So were Colonel Benson,&#xD;
his son and Isabella Benson, his. son's wife, and her father,&#xD;
.Pitt Granville. The latter was an unhappy, miserable man.&#xD;
He had made a grand mistake in the Count. He had always&#xD;
supposed he was a nobody.-an adventurer. He had had him&#xD;
as a clerk, and had treated him as a clerk; and now to find that&#xD;
this ci devant clerk was a real count-a nobleman, with a&#xD;
princely income and a large, cash capital, and about to carry off&#xD;
a bride with a hundred and fifty thousand dollars more, was too&#xD;
bad. He might have had the Count for his own daughter, if&#xD;
he had awoke a little sooner, and then, as he contpasted the&#xD;
elegant, well-dresged, accomplished Count, passing from one to&#xD;
another o( the guests, an object of universal admiration, and&#xD;
winning smiles from the most beautiful by his wit and bril-&#xD;
liant conversation, and then turned his eyes to his own son-in-&#xD;
law, who sat in one corner, looking sheepish and stupid, no one&#xD;
appearing to be aware that such a person was in existence, lie&#xD;
felt mortified and vexed at his own past folly and stupidity.&#xD;
All the friends and connexions of the Graspers were present&#xD;
in fall force. The bride radiated among them, dressed in&#xD;
spotless white and sparkling with jewels. She was proud of&#xD;
her husband, and well she might be, for the Count could shine&#xD;
any where, and he appeared devoted to his wife.&#xD;
It had been arranged that the bridal pair should start the&#xD;
next morning on -an excursion, which was expected to ocupy&#xD;
some weeks.&#xD;
The Count approached Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, who were&#xD;
quietly enjoying the gay scene. He shook hands with them&#xD;
cordially, and they congratulated him upon his. brilliant mar-&#xD;
riage. The Count replied with deep fervor to Mrs. Wilson,&#xD;
"Ah, dear madam; I can never forget you. That first night,&#xD;
when I was so poor, and when M~ario, God bless him, carried&#xD;
me to his room. Oh, you have brought me good, luck. It&#xD;
&#xD;
started me anew, and you, Mr. Wilson, how kind you ever were&#xD;
to me, I shall never forget."&#xD;
Mrs. Wilson replied: "Poor Marion. I am told that he is&#xD;
not doing very well, Don't forget him, Count, for if you do&#xD;
owe any one for your success, it was Marion."&#xD;
"May my head perish when I forget it. No, Mrs. Wilson,&#xD;
I have a place on my hands for the good of Marion. He shall&#xD;
be in business before I leave this land for my ,own country,&#xD;
and-with, plenty of means. You have heard of that dreadful&#xD;
event this morning, Wilson ?" he inquired, in a low voice.&#xD;
Both husband and wife started, and asked to what he alluded.&#xD;
"1Don't mention it here to-night, but Colonel Mac Neil died&#xD;
of delirium tremens in one of the wards of  the hospital this&#xD;
morning about daybreak. Marion Monck has removed the&#xD;
dead body to residence of Miss McPherson and Mac's children.&#xD;
Is it not shocking ? I must leave you now. Do not forget&#xD;
ie, "-'-and with these words the Count passed on to greet other&#xD;
guests.&#xD;
Wilson-gazed into the face of his wife. Neither could speak&#xD;
for some moments. Both knew the history of Colonel Mae&#xD;
Neil. Both knew that he was once a favored lover of her who&#xD;
was now- the ountess Falsechinski. At last Mr; Wilson&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
"I Darling, Iam sick of stopping here. Can't we contrive to&#xD;
go ? Poor Mac Neil ; what : sad fate. I shall .go to, his fu-&#xD;
neral, wife. I wish I could have done more, What a blow it&#xD;
would be to the gay bride, if the truth could reach her to-night,&#xD;
eh?"&#xD;
'I hope it may not, Richard. She could not have helped&#xD;
the matter-and only think of that poor woman and her two&#xD;
children.  Well-well-as people sow, so must they reap.&#xD;
What a contrast between the melancholy death of one lover&#xD;
and the gay bridal of another, and yet the one who has died a&#xD;
horrid death, I first met the courted and caressed by all the&#xD;
wealth and fashion of -the city. The other, who- is now sur-&#xD;
rouded by wealth, admiring friends, a title, a rich bride, came,&#xD;
to my house in the dead of winter, and without food or scarcely&#xD;
any clothes. But for the kindness of Marion Monck might&#xD;
have perihed in the streets that night. Does it not make you&#xD;
shudder to think of such changes in life, husband ?" asked the&#xD;
wife.&#xD;
Thank God, and you, my darling Bessy, I am too comfort-&#xD;
able to dread them. Weinmust stay until supper is ever. I&#xD;
'will go and tell Mr. Granville about Mae Neil's death."&#xD;

lHe left his wife to do as he stated. *He was absent but a&#xD;
moment, and when he returned he observed,- ' I have done a&#xD;
very foolish thing.' I never saw a man so horrified -,as Grani-&#xD;
villa appears to be. I am sorry I told'him any thing about tho&#xD;
matter."&#xD;
Mrs. Isabella Benson was at this wedding party, and her&#xD;
beauty attracted a great' deal of admiration. Many solicited&#xD;
an introduction to her, but her conversational powers were not&#xD;
sufficient-to retain by her side those that her pretty features&#xD;
attracted thithe'r.&#xD;
The supper was a~ superb affair, and no pains or expense&#xD;
were spared to make it excel all suppers that ever came off be-&#xD;
fore in a private house. Old Mr. Prime declared that he had&#xD;
never been it such a supper, and his indorsement was always a&#xD;
good one for a note or a supper.&#xD;
It was at a very late hour when the party broke up. All the.&#xD;
guests were pleased, and went to their homes envying both&#xD;
bride and bridegroom. Such is life.&#xD;
The neft morning all the gay guests at 'that wedding read&#xD;
t6e notice of Colonel Mae Neil's death, and that his funeral&#xD;
would take place that afternoon from 27 Harrison street.&#xD;
When the appointed hour arrived, there was a large crowd&#xD;
gathered. It hardly seemed possible that, the Colonel had so&#xD;
many friends, or even acquaintances. Mr.'Granville was there.&#xD;
So was Colonel Benson and Mr. Wilson and many others. The&#xD;
body was to be conveyed to Greenwood Cemetery. The widow&#xD;
and the children were in a carriage by themselves, where they&#xD;
followecf the corpse until it was placed beneath the sod.' Then&#xD;
Marion Monck got- into the carriage, and returned with the&#xD;
three weepers. As the little party crossed the ferry, Miss&#xD;
McPherson spoke.   "Mr. Monck, you have been a trae friend&#xD;
to us in our need, and God will bless you for it. Out of all&#xD;
the Colonel's friends, you alone seem to have been a true one.&#xD;
I want you to do one thing more. Get all his things from the&#xD;
place that he frequented, and bring them to me. I will give&#xD;
you his own authority for their removal."  She then told Ma-&#xD;
rion about the last day he had spent with his little family.&#xD;
He had a presentiment that he was to die, and it.-came true."&#xD;
The day following that of the funeral, Marion caused the&#xD;
bureau another effects of the late Colonel to be removed to&#xD;
the residence of his widow, as hie called her, and by which title&#xD;
she was ever after recognized by those who valued Mac Neil's&#xD;

Walter Oranville before he made himself known to his uncle&#xD;
Tom. The time had been devoted to Miss Norris, who had&#xD;
continued to reside at Mrs. Woodruff's, and where she had a&#xD;
fill opportunity 'to exert her extraordinary powers of fascina-&#xD;
tion upon the young sailor. Never had she appeared so young&#xD;
and so lovely. She accompanied him to every place of public&#xD;
amusement, rode out with him, walked with him, delicately&#xD;
furnished him with a stream of money, and bestowed upon him&#xD;
presents of value and of utility. .She had a purpose in all this.&#xD;
She made up her mind to succeed, and success seemed almost&#xD;
within her grasp. She deterwineA to injure the elder Gran-&#xD;
ville, and she saw no surer method than by plunging his only&#xD;
son into a vortex from which there was no escape.&#xD;
She had proposed to Walter that-he should marry her. She&#xD;
explained to him that she was comparatively independent.--&#xD;
satisfied him that he had gained 'her affections, and that her&#xD;
whole soul was his. He certainly was leading a pleasant life.&#xD;
He had no idea but that his father had losed his heart and his&#xD;
doors upon him forever. Clara had behaved nobly to him, as&#xD;
he thought, for she had not only made him comfortable, but she&#xD;
had advanced Henry Robinson a considerable sum, to enable&#xD;
him to support the expense of Rose and himself at a second-&#xD;
rate hotel. Yet Walter hesitated. He had not Inade up his&#xD;
mind fully in the matter until the morning of his interview&#xD;
with his uncle Tom.' .The 'night previous he and Clara had&#xD;
.conversed together upon the subject of marriage. He had&#xD;
asked means to give a helping hand to his relative; and she&#xD;
ad agreed to it at once. At tire same time sher told Water&#xD;

As she loved him, it' should not continue another day.&#xD;
"It willbreak iny heart, Walter, to part witli' you, but it&#xD;
must be done. You have one advantage over me, Walter.&#xD;
When we are married, if you do not continue to love me, or&#xD;
get tired, you can run away and go to sea again."&#xD;
The hint was not lost upon Walter, and that morning, when&#xD;
he went out to-find Thomas Granville, he said, "Clara, I will&#xD;
marry you as soon as you please, but let it all be done quietly."&#xD;
"Then sappose it be this evening, in presence of. only one&#xD;
or two witnesses. :.You promise to bring up your uncle, and I&#xD;
will go out and invite your f-iend Robinson," said Clara.&#xD;
"The clergyman-who will you get" to performs that cere-&#xD;
inony ?" asked Walter.&#xD;
" Leave all that to me, dear Walter, and don't worry your-&#xD;
self about the matter. It shall all be regular, and with no&#xD;
noise," replied Clara.,&#xD;
With this understanding 'the  arties separated. Walter&#xD;
went in search of his uncle Tom, and. Clara Norris to make&#xD;
her arrangements.&#xD;
Walter found his relative in the destitute state we have de-&#xD;
scribed. He left hiin well provided for, and it did Walter's&#xD;
heart gopd, for with all-his faults he loved his uncle Tom, and&#xD;
sympathized with his misfortune. After leaving Mr. Thomas&#xD;
Granville in the manner we have described, he returned to&#xD;
Bond street. - There he found his friend Henry Robinson and&#xD;
the lovely 'little Rose. He was still iore gratified when he&#xD;
found that the two friends were invited to stay and dine.&#xD;
"So, Walter, you are going to marry Miss, Norris," ex-&#xD;
claimed Henry Robinson.&#xD;
"Yes-'that is my intention. Have you any tbing to say&#xD;
against it ?" replied Walter.&#xD;
"Not a word, my dear boy. I am not so certain but that I&#xD;
shall follow your example one of these days. I shall if I ever&#xD;
gee my way clear to support my little Rose; but hang it, man,&#xD;
I am afraid that had it not been for. your intended, Rose and&#xD;
me would have had.to part company before this. Money was&#xD;
getting very -scarce when Miss Clara came to our relief," re-&#xD;
marked Robinson.&#xD;
The opinion of his friend and companion for years, .had its&#xD;
weight with Walter Granville, and confirmed him in his inten-'&#xD;
tions, Rose timidly asked, if his. father, meaning the elder&#xD;
Granville, was pleased with the proposed match. Walter gave&#xD;
&#xD;
VOR.                       3&#xD;
hera' stern look, and then perceiving that- she did not - ntice&#xD;
it, added,&#xD;
"My -pretty Rose, my father troubles his head very little&#xD;
about my affairs, and I presume does not care whom I marry.&#xD;
Ile must have heard that I am in the city, but not a word of&#xD;
kindness or a message of any kind have .I received fro 'him&#xD;
or any other of my family. They may go to the old Harry for&#xD;
all'that I care. But come, dinner is ready, and we ought to&#xD;
be thankful that-we can get a good dinner. We have not al-&#xD;
ways been so lucky, have we, Harry ?"&#xD;
The-dinner was a choice affair, and the hostess, Mrs. Wood-&#xD;
ruff, graced the head of the table and did the honors.&#xD;
"My beautiful landlady," exclaimed Walter, "you are the&#xD;
prettiest of the three ladies now at this table. You actually&#xD;
look younger than any of them, and if my hand was not already&#xD;
disposed of, I would -certainly offer a share of my hard for-&#xD;
tunes to you."&#xD;
"Thank you, sir.  I am exceedingly flattered, but Miss&#xD;
Norris has taken the matter in hand, and I am. too late.  I&#xD;
must say, however, that if I envied any lady it.would be Clara.&#xD;
I think you are-one of a thousand, and she is an extremely for.&#xD;
tunate young lady."&#xD;
"Thank you, madam, for both of us," replied Clara.&#xD;
Dinner was over, and evening approached, when 'Miss Nor-&#xD;
ris went to her room to commence dressing for the important&#xD;
ceremony, which it was arranged should come off in the front&#xD;
parlor  Rose accompanied-Clara, and Harry jdined ,Walter,&#xD;
who left Bond street to walk as far as the 2Hotel de Paris,&#xD;
where he had agreed to meet Thomas Granville. They found&#xD;
Tom deeply engrossed in a game of dominoes with old James&#xD;
Gemnmel, the Broadway watchmaker, who owned the 'building&#xD;
occupied as the Hotel de Paris.&#xD;
" Excuse' me one moment," exclaimed Tom, when he saiv&#xD;
Walter, "I have only got twelve to go to beat this gentleman,&#xD;
and then I am at your service."&#xD;
Walter took as seat at one of the small marble-top tables, and&#xD;
motioning Henry to a seat opposite, he ordered two cups of-&#xD;
coffee.- The garcon brought the cups, and Walter lit a cigar.-&#xD;
"IHarry, did you notice that gentleman that I spoke ?"&#xD;
lhe asked.&#xD;
"yI did. Pray who is he ?" asked Henry.&#xD;
"cHe is mine uncle Tom, that you have so often heard me&#xD;
chat about, during our watches at sea in the go d old' hle&#xD;
ship," replied Walter.&#xD;

&#xD;
The deuce he is ! Well, I like his looks very much.&#xD;
Will he beat your wedding ?" asked Robinson.&#xD;
Yes. But I don't exactly know how he will take it. He&#xD;
must know Clara. But I will find out presently," said Walter.&#xD;
At this moment they were joined by Thomas Granville. He'&#xD;
rubbed his hands, and exclaimed with delight, " Aha! I am&#xD;
-conqueror. I have beat old Mr. Gemmel, and he is -considered&#xD;
the crack player in' this house."&#xD;
"Sit dowp, sir. One would think you had won a second&#xD;
battle of Waterloo, or some other equally important affair.&#xD;
Allow me to introduce to you my friend Henry Robinson,o&#xD;
said Water.&#xD;
"I am most happy to meet Mr. Robinson, or any other&#xD;
friend bf yours, my excellent Smith. Gents, will you join me'&#xD;
in a drink ?" inquired Tom.&#xD;
It was quite evident to Walter that his worthy uncle had&#xD;
already drank quite sufficient, and he suggested in place of a&#xD;
drink, that he should join them in a cup of coffee.  /&#xD;
"Very well-I think Iwill do as you suggest. I hav/ been&#xD;
drinking considerable wine to-day," said Tom.&#xD;
I should judge so. The coffee will'sober you, and I want&#xD;
you to be perfectly cool to-night, for I am to be married this&#xD;
evening, and you are to be at the wedding," said Walter.&#xD;
"The devil I am! And is that what all these new clothes&#xD;
are for-hem-I beg your pardon, sir."  And Tom addressed&#xD;
Robinson.  He had  forgot himself.  -1.w.m      .   m&#xD;
"Never mind, M . Granville. You will be welcome to my&#xD;
wedding in any dress. And now I perceive that you have&#xD;
been getting a new rig-out 'of 'compliment to me, I presume.&#xD;
Really, I am under obligations to you. Come, suppose, we&#xD;
pay our shot, and then leave-what say you, gentlemen ?" asked&#xD;
Walter.&#xD;
All agreed, and soon after the trio left the Hotel de Paris,&#xD;
and proceeded up Broadway to'Bond street. When the party&#xD;
reached the hpuse of Mrs. Woodruff, Tom remarked that his&#xD;
brother's old partner, Mr. Nordheim, used to reside next door.&#xD;
" I am well aware of tbat,". quietly observed Walter.&#xD;
Come in, gentlemen," he continued'; and then 'led the way&#xD;
into the front parlor. No one was there. "Excuse me, 1r.&#xD;
Granville. Come, Harry," said Walter Granville; and with&#xD;
his companion'he passed up to the room occupied by Clara.&#xD;
"Mfay I come inwith my friend Iarry '?"demanded Walter.&#xD;
AlYes, come ini e are almost dressed-but we don't mind&#xD;
you. Look at Rose, Harry. How do you like her 'I"&#xD;
&#xD;
Iarry did look. The beautiful girl was dressed in a robe&#xD;
of white satin, and her dark hair, parted upon her forehead,&#xD;
and divided to the back of her head, fell in two distinct masses&#xD;
down her back, and the end of each was tied with a white rib-&#xD;
bon. Her lover flung his arms about her, and said,&#xD;
"Thank you, dear Iiss Norris. Rose was a;.ways lovely,&#xD;
but I have never seen her look so superb as she does to-day.&#xD;
What do we not owe y a ?&#xD;
.," Harry Robinson, let me tell you one- thing, and God knows&#xD;
it is true. The talk of men, when it concerns women, is as&#xD;
light and evanescent as a summer cloud. Under certain in-&#xD;
fluences men agree to do any and every thing for a woman-a&#xD;
young and pretty woman. They will marry-do this, or do&#xD;
that, or the other. In an hour-a week-a month, all this is&#xD;
changed. They will see the Magdalen they have made de-&#xD;
spised, trampled upon, stoned even--and that same deceiving&#xD;
man will cast the additional stone that crushes the spoor out#*&#xD;
cast. She who has believed these promises dies a slow death&#xD;
from poisonous disease in the almshouse, and finds an unknown&#xD;
grave in the Potter's Field. Young man, you have a proud,&#xD;
rich father. He would see you wed with wealth and respecta-&#xD;
bility, with a girl who has read. all sorts of vile trash-who&#xD;
has never known. sorrow, who has drank. wine daily at her&#xD;
father's table, and nursed her luscious imagination with a thou-&#xD;
sand corruptingthoughts until her soul was polluted. But she&#xD;
is virtuous! Nay, the very girl your father would wish you&#xD;
to marry, from the rich, the fashionable, and the pious circles&#xD;
of high society, ninety-nine chances in one hundred, is a pros-&#xD;
titute at heart, and when once your wife, as the fountain is&#xD;
already poisoned, so the rivulet will be, and she will become a&#xD;
prostitute in body the first chance she gets. Now look at that&#xD;
vision of loveliness, gazing with her big black eyes at me while&#xD;
I speak. She was made a prostitute in body while her mind&#xD;
was as pure from stain as the white satin that now adorns her&#xD;
person.- Her body was polluted, but her soul never entered&#xD;
iito the act. She loved you with her mind the first time she&#xD;
saw you. She loved you with her soul. You are her go'd-.&#xD;
With you she leaves the den of infancy as gladly as the wild&#xD;
bird leaves the wiry cage where it was confined. Take her&#xD;
now to the altar, and let her become your wife, and she, that&#xD;
little one, so beautiful, would clig to you till death, true as&#xD;
steel, and as impervious to vice or vicious influences as the&#xD;
flint. stone-: She- would neyer~ be.s unfaithful-s-never untrue.&#xD;
She would guard your honor as her life, as the very jewel of&#xD;

her existence ; for her virtue lies in that particle of Deity--.&#xD;
her soul. That has never been polluted or soiled. The world&#xD;
judges differently, but I speak what I know. Marry Rose,&#xD;
dear -Farry, and if you live on bread and water, sweep streets&#xD;
for a living, while she acts as washerwoman for your mutual&#xD;
livelihood,-a's long as you are true to each other, you will know&#xD;
a happiness that wealth cannot give."&#xD;
. While Clara Norris was giving vent, to these expressions,&#xD;
Walter Granville was looking at her in amazement. - While she&#xD;
was speaking a pin falling would have been heard.&#xD;
He then added, "Clara, have you spoken for yourself?"&#xD;
"God knows-I have spoken for Rose, for she has. a pure,&#xD;
loving, innocent heart, that a few weeks' residence, in a brothel&#xD;
has not soiled or tarnished. As for me, I have been a world-&#xD;
ling deeply-perhaps damnably.     The Great Judge only&#xD;
,knows. - I do not know my .own heart, Walter. Did you bring&#xD;
up Thomas Granville with you ?" she asked.&#xD;
" I did. 'Left him down stairs, Clara," said Walter.&#xD;
" Go down at once and apologize. Tell him you will be back&#xD;
Presently," said Clara.&#xD;
Walter descended to the parlor, but returned almost. in.&#xD;
stantly, and addressing Clara, said, "'Uncle Tom is fast asleep&#xD;
upon one of Mrs. Woodruff's exquisite sofas."&#xD;
" Well, let him sleep there until we are ready to descend.....&#xD;
and now what was I saying? Oh, about the vice of the body&#xD;
and the vice of the mind, so far as us poor women are con-&#xD;
cerned. Never mind. I don't think,:Walter, that my heart.&#xD;
is corrupted, and I am sure that of' Rose is not. To-night I&#xD;
become your wife, and wild and wayward as has been my ca-&#xD;
reer, dear Walter, I will be true to you while I live. So help&#xD;
me, Heaven. Henry, you do not need to be told what" Rose&#xD;
will do. You can read all that is passing in her heart in her&#xD;
sweet, heavenly face; Walter, will you forgive me for one act&#xD;
I have done to-day ?"- asked Miss Norris.&#xD;
"Tell me what it is, Clara. If it is not the unpardonable&#xD;
sin, I think I 'can forgive you," replied Walter. -&#xD;
'I have invited Marion Monck, once a favorite ulerk of your&#xD;
father's-once a favored suitor of your sister Isabella, to be&#xD;
present to-night," said Miss Norris..&#xD;
'Y.ou are a strange creature, Clara. Why' invite him?&#xD;
Whathave I, or. you, for that matter. in common, with him?&#xD;
What is he to us now ?" haughtily demanded. Walter.&#xD;
" More than 'ever he was in what. the world calls his pros.-&#xD;

don't laughA-he writes poetry. He has not spoken to 'me for&#xD;
some time, but last St. Valentine's Day I received from  him&#xD;
this precious valentine." Here Clara went to a small desk and&#xD;
took an envelope from it, and the enclosure she handed to Wal-&#xD;
ter. "Read that."&#xD;
Walter drew near the lamp. He looked 'at the hand-writing&#xD;
a moment. "How. well I remember that writing," he ex-&#xD;
clainied.. "It is indeed written by Marion, but-no signature is&#xD;
attached. How did you recognize it, Clara ?"&#xD;
"Pooh! pooh-! I have seen his hand-writing a hundred&#xD;
times in the days of Mr. Nordheim. I knew it at once, but&#xD;
read it."  Walter read the poetry. It was as follows :-&#xD;

THE OUTCAST.&#xD;
I look upon that face, but while&#xD;
It seems so passing fair,&#xD;
I ask me if that sunny smile&#xD;

I ask me if that bosom's heave&#xD;
Hides not a heart that-s doomed to grieve&#xD;
And wither in despair;&#xD;
I ask if joy or peace can be&#xD;
With one so desolate as thee.&#xD;
I knew thee not, thou fallen flower,&#xD;
When virtue marked thy growth,&#xD;
I knew thee not in thy bright hour&#xD;
Of purity and truth.&#xD;
I knew thee nottil treacherous ways&#xD;
Had dimmed the sunshine of thy days,&#xD;
The freshness of thy youth;&#xD;
And theil I knew thee in thy shame&#xD;
Without a friend-without a name.&#xD;
An outcast from thy father's home,&#xD;
A blighted, joyless thing;&#xD;
Thy journey onward to the tomb,&#xD;
A rayless wandering.&#xD;
Uncheered by hope thy bosom heaves&#xD;
Yet like 'the rose's scattered leaves,&#xD;
Some sweets yeti round there' cling;&#xD;
And dimly round thy'ruin shine&#xD;
Like ivy on-the shattered pine.&#xD;
There's beauty still upon thy brow,&#xD;
And kindnes in thy heart,&#xD;
A smile is with thee even now,&#xD;
Allhopeless as thou art.&#xD;

9 Yes, dear Walter, I want that young man who could ad.&#xD;
dress me such lines, to see me married-yes, married. I&#xD;
should die were he not here to-night, for that poetry has,&#xD;
weighed like lead upon my heart. But as your wife,.the spell&#xD;
will be removed," exclaimed the excited Miss Norris.&#xD;
"I am very glad, then, Clara, that you have invited&#xD;
him. But come, you are all dressed. Holloa, what is the&#xD;
matter with you, my beautiful Rose?"&#xD;
Rose was weeping as though her heart would break. The&#xD;
few lines, as read by Walter in his deep-toned voice, touched&#xD;
a chord that had vibrated through her hosom.  She made, no&#xD;
reply to Walter, but fell upon her knees'before Henry Robin-&#xD;
son.&#xD;
" Oh, dear Henry, save me from such a fate as that of the&#xD;
poor outcast," she exclaimed.  1&#xD;
"It shall be, Rose-it shall be. My mind is made up. Dear&#xD;
Miss-Norris, may I ask one favor ?  After the clergyman has&#xD;
made you and Walter one, let him do the same for us two-make&#xD;
Rose my wife. Come what will, I will be her legal protector&#xD;
her husband."&#xD;
" God bless you, Harry," was all the reply that Rose could&#xD;
make.&#xD;
"I will see to it," said the majestic Clara.&#xD;
A slight tap at the door interrupted the conversation,&#xD;
" Who is there ?" asked Walter.&#xD;
"Me-Mrs. Woodruff. There are some guests in the parlor.&#xD;
Are you not most ready ?" she asked.&#xD;
The reply was in the affirmative, and in a moment the door&#xD;
was opened and the party followed Mrs. Woodruff down stairs.&#xD;
As they entered the parlor a singular sight was presented-&#xD;
Thomas Granville lay asleep, and was storing upon the sofa.&#xD;
There was a clergyman in his robes, evidently of the Episco-&#xD;
&#xD;
345&#xD;
&#xD;
,, la&#xD;
&#xD;
pal order, for he wore a white surplice, and held in his hand&#xD;
the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England.&#xD;
In one corner of the room was Marion Monck.  It was the'&#xD;
ladylike duty of Miss Norris to place these people at their&#xD;
ease. She walked to Marion.&#xD;
"Old friend, have you forgotten one, known to you many&#xD;
years ago? This is Walter Granville.&#xD;
Simple as the words were, they electrified Marion. Walter&#xD;
was his old employer's son-the brother of her he remembered&#xD;
with such tender recollections.&#xD;
"Walter, why when did you come ? I am glad to see you,"&#xD;
.was all Marion could say, and it was enough.&#xD;
Walter said some kind words, and sat down by him. Clara&#xD;
proceeded to the clergyman.&#xD;
I " Venerable sir, in a moment we will be .ready for you to,&#xD;
proceed. When you have married me to Mr. Granville, will&#xD;
you marry these two to each other ?" and she pointed to Hen-&#xD;
ry and Rose.&#xD;
The clergyman bowed, and replied, "Most certainly, if there&#xD;
are no objections,"&#xD;
"None in the wide world," said Clara, and she passed to&#xD;
the sofa where Thomas Granville was lying.' She placed her&#xD;
hand heavily upon him, and in a deep voice pronounced the&#xD;
single word "Tom!"&#xD;
"In a moment he aroused himself, rubbed: his eyes, looked up&#xD;
in her face, and replied,&#xD;
"iHolloa! what's out now ?  Clara, is that you ? Where did&#xD;
you come from 1"&#xD;
She made no reply.  Then he sat up and looked about the&#xD;
room, recognizing Marion, and also the man he knew as Smith.&#xD;
He repeated, "Marion and Smith here  - That is all tight."&#xD;
"Tom !" Clara repeated again.&#xD;
"Well, what is it ?" asked Tom.&#xD;
" You are invited here to be present at a wedding.  Are&#xD;
you-sufficiently awake to be a witness ?"&#xD;
" Certainly. Of course. Go ahead.  I am all right," said&#xD;
Tom.&#xD;
Clara turned about and walked to the clergyman.&#xD;
" We are ready now, sir, Please proceed with the solemn.&#xD;
ceremony."&#xD;
She was joined by Walter, and the clergyman opened his&#xD;
book and performed the ceremony of marriage according to the&#xD;
Ritual. When it was finished, and the reverenid mandof God&#xD;
pronounced them man and wife, Walter kissed Clara affection-&#xD;

ately, and then Henry Robinson and Rose were made "one&#xD;
flesh."  Clara then approached the clergyman and placed a bill&#xD;
in his hand.&#xD;
"Allow me," said she, "to settle the fees for myself and&#xD;
for the other couple."&#xD;
The clergyman, perhaps without meaning to do so, glanced&#xD;
at the denomination of the bill.&#xD;
"Really, madam," he suddenly exclaimed, "there is some&#xD;
mistake; this note is for one hundred dollars."&#xD;
"So I supposed. Keep"it. If it is unusual, use it to make&#xD;
others as happy as I trust you have made several in the room&#xD;
this evening," quietly observed Mrs. Walter Granville.&#xD;
"Where can I find pen and paper ?" asked the clergyman.&#xD;
"That lady," pointing to Mrs. Woodruff, " will show you,"&#xD;
and she whispered to the clergyman, " May I ask that you will&#xD;
give them certificates for each marriage, if not too much trou-.&#xD;
ble ? You have the names."&#xD;
" Certainly," said the minister, and he left the room.&#xD;
Marion Monek had seen so many astonishing things in an&#xD;
experience of some years. that he had long ago arrived at the&#xD;
conclusion that he would never more be astonished at, any&#xD;
thing which might occur in New York; still le was surprised,&#xD;
to say the least of it, at the. marriage of the somewhat celebra-&#xD;
ted Mliss Norris to the runaway son of his old employer. He&#xD;
offered his congratulations to the lady now Mrs. Granville and&#xD;
to -her husband. The former requested to speak with Marion&#xD;
for a moment alone.&#xD;
When she found herself thus with him, she observed, "Ma-&#xD;
rion, we have known each other a long time, through some&#xD;
strange vicissitudes, eh ?. Is it not a strange world ?"&#xD;
"Rather so," replied Marion in a very laconic manner.&#xD;
"Will you take back your poetry'about''1the OUTvAST?' I&#xD;
am now a married woman-married to a man whose father is&#xD;
an eminent merchant, eh ?"&#xD;
, 'Exactly, 'dear lady; I understand perfectly well your sar-&#xD;
casmn, bt it don't apply ; I den't take it. I wr6te 'the Out.&#xD;
cast ' when it did-apply.  You were at old Mother Miller's,&#xD;
you know. Don't be angry ; I will write another .piece which&#xD;
you will like better when I have leisure, and call it  The&#xD;
Wife,' eh ?"&#xD;
" Now stop all foolishness. Here is five dollars : take it,"&#xD;
said 'Clara Granville. -&#xD;
*" What is out now ? Do you mean to insult me I"&#xD;
"No, Mariou, far from it; but I want this notice copied,&#xD;
&#xD;
and to appear in all the daily papers to-morrow morning: Will&#xD;
you attend to it ? I krow. you will. Say nothing.,. I must&#xD;
speak to Mr. Thomas Granville," said Mrs. Granville.&#xD;
Marion read the note. It was as follows:&#xD;
" Married-On Tuesday evening, the 29th instant, by the&#xD;
Rev. Samuel Fuller, Walter Granville, Esq., son of W. Pitt&#xD;
Granville, of this city, to Miss Clara Norris, formerly of New&#xD;
Jersey."&#xD;
It is needl'essto say that this notice- appeared in all the&#xD;
journals the next day.&#xD;
Clara approached Tom Granville. She seated herself ,by&#xD;
his side. This gentleman had listened to all.hat was going&#xD;
on. He was perfectly conscious that people bad been married&#xD;
-he knew that Clara'Norris had married his friend Smith,&#xD;
and he had made up.his mind that Smith was "sold," accord-&#xD;
ing to his ideas of how the world ought to wagnou;but-heha4&#xD;
caught no other name, or if he had, it had not fastened itself&#xD;
upon his mind. But he was soon to be enlightened, Clara&#xD;
had him alone, and she commenced.&#xD;
" Tom Gravaville, do you. remember how you treated me in&#xD;
France ?  Your heartlessness, your villany-selling me to&#xD;
make an income for you to spend upon other women ? . Rear&#xD;
me. and don't say a word. You know this is true. Grant that&#xD;
I in many things did wrong. Does that justify what you have&#xD;
done ?"&#xD;
"Oh Clara, don't let us bring up old sores. Letv bygones&#xD;
be bygones. You have married Smith.   Nice man, I dare&#xD;
say. Respectable man, evidently. I'm mumn. I'll not say a&#xD;
word. Do you understand ?",&#xD;
"Tom, do you recollect how your brother' humbled me when&#xD;
I was kept' by Nordheim ? Do you know the exerti9ns 'that he&#xD;
used to deprive me of what I received from Mr.- Nordheimn?&#xD;
He called me harlot, pfostitute,.vile wretch, and a few other&#xD;
names that a woman never forgives nor forgets," said Clara.&#xD;
",Well, what of it?. It don't amount to anything now," re-&#xD;
plied Tom.&#xD;
"Your' wife, your niece-how did they treat me ?" asked&#xD;
the now excited Clara.&#xD;
Oh, what matters all such' stuff-what is the use of brig.&#xD;
ing it up now ?  This is your 'wedding night,"Old gal. You&#xD;
have married Smith, let's all be j lly, eh ?" said T1o, ho&#xD;
was still under the influence of liqaor although he ha4 h d _&#xD;

"Tom, now listen to me. I want to give you an introduce-&#xD;
tion to my husband. Walter, come here," said Clara.&#xD;
Walter approached the sofa..&#xD;
"Mr. Thomas Granville, allow me to introduce to you my&#xD;
husband, Mr. Walter Granville. If I am not mistaken, he is&#xD;
also your nephew ;" and when she had said this, she gave one&#xD;
loud scream of hysterical laughter, and then sat down. Tom&#xD;
could not join in it ; he was sobered, and asked,&#xD;
Walter, is this so ?"&#xD;
"lit is, uncle Tom. Did you not know me V&#xD;
*And are you the husband of this lady ?" pointing to Clara,&#xD;
who was watching this conversation.4&#xD;
I believe that there is no mistake about that," replied&#xD;
the other.&#xD;
" Then may God have mercy upon the Granvillefamily; we&#xD;
are a doomed race," said Tom solemnly.&#xD;
"1Why, uncle Tom, cheer up; don't you get down-hearted.'&#xD;
You at least know how I am situated-.--a cast-off.  I found a&#xD;
true friend in Miss Clara when I had no other friends," -ob-&#xD;
served Walter-.&#xD;
"I am a broken-hearted man, nephew-3rushed. I have no&#xD;
hope except to get a bed at night, an occasional meal of vic-&#xD;
tuals, and drink and clothes. You have helped me along on&#xD;
-my rough bye path, and I thank you for it.  I do not know&#xD;
how you came by the means to do so. But what matters it,&#xD;
Clara ? God bless you. You are -my niece now. What you&#xD;
are driving at is beyond my ken.  Never mind; play out the&#xD;
game your own way.. You hold ace, king, queen and jack of&#xD;
the Granville family in your own bands, and your suit is&#xD;
trumps. It is the -winning hand. Heaven send queen to Pitt&#xD;
Granville. When will he hear the news ?" continued Tom.&#xD;
Clara and Walter had listened attentively to the abrupt lan-&#xD;
guage of uncle Tom. Both knew that in other days, when his&#xD;
proud spirit was dominant, such a marriage would have been'&#xD;
repudiated on the instant if it had cost him his life blood. But&#xD;
they knew that stern poverty will humble the haughtiest heart.&#xD;
He who lacks food for months, he who stoops to almost beg&#xD;
from friends a shilling for a night's lodging; he who is ragged,&#xD;
-shirtless, and wants the ordinary comforts of even a wash-bowl&#xD;
and towel, soon comes'down to that low level, that were his&#xD;
wife, sister, or even mother, placed in affluence at the price&#xD;
of her virtue, would receive a portion of the wages . of vice,&#xD;

Mrs. Woodruff had left for her apartments, and Henry, with&#xD;
the happy Mrs. Robinson, had gone to the nuptial couch. The&#xD;
clergyrhan had also taken his leave, and man and wife, with&#xD;
that worldly unele, were alone. At last he bade - them good&#xD;
night. Walter did not rise. Clara followed him out of the&#xD;
roim. As they stood in the hall, she said:&#xD;
"Tom Granville, I know what you would say. This will be&#xD;
a fearful thing for Pitt. He *ill see it in the morning papers.&#xD;
Will he die ?"&#xD;
"INo. It will make him mad-stark, raving mad.&#xD;
"Tom, you. may need money. Take this roll-take it kindly.&#xD;
I don't know how much there is-two or three hundred. You&#xD;
are a man of the world-use it wisely, Ton. Good night."&#xD;
Thomas Granville, late United States Consul in the second&#xD;
city of France, was in the street. The moon was shining&#xD;
brightly over his head, and he had more money. in his pocket&#xD;
than had been there for many long months. As he passed&#xD;
down Broadway, he soliloquized,&#xD;
"Last night I had no bread-I had no money. I had barely&#xD;
a few dirty coppers to keep me from sleeping in the streets-&#xD;
no clothes-no decent boots-no hat--no cravat---no nothing.&#xD;
To-night I have as much as I need. A hotel-a room to go to,&#xD;
and money in my pocket. How did I get it all? Least said&#xD;
is soonest mended. From this day forth I will never be with-&#xD;
out money. Gold is all.&#xD;
'That yellow slave&#xD;
Will knit and breakreligions; bless the accursed;&#xD;
Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves,&#xD;
And give them title, knee and approbation&#xD;
With senators on the bench.&#xD;
Whatever else I lose, I will never be again without gold."&#xD;
Thomas Granville reached his hotel. A silver shilling am-&#xD;
ply rewarded the porter for opening the door, and he went to&#xD;
his room.&#xD;

Peruvian Girls.&#xD;
THE1RE are few situations of more intense peril in human&#xD;
life than to be in a large city, needing money for the ordinary&#xD;
necessaries of existence, or witho&amp;amp;- any regular source of in.&#xD;
come. The man who works from six in the morning until dark&#xD;
at night, even if he only gets a- dollar a day; is comparatively&#xD;
independent, and is not exposed to temptation., His wages are&#xD;
small, but he makes his expenses bear a fair proportion to his&#xD;
income. If he earns but six dollars a week, his board costs&#xD;
him but two-his clothes do not cost him' fifty cents a week,&#xD;
and'his other expenses, for pipes and tobacco, and his glass of.&#xD;
.beer or gin, may make a dollar more per week, and he actually&#xD;
can lay up two and a half dollars per week.. Women, wine and&#xD;
cards are'beyond his wishes. His income would go but*a lit-&#xD;
tle way for the indulgence 6f either, and he never gives them&#xD;
even a passing thought. If he gets out of employ as a day,&#xD;
laborer, it is not a source of much anxiety, for as he has no.&#xD;
pride to get over, but is content to take up with whatever&#xD;
turns up, he soon finda something to do, and ho is at his' ease&#xD;
once more.&#xD;
This is not the case with the, young man who has been a clerk&#xD;
in a 'store. He "considers a clerkship, an honorable employ-&#xD;
ment. He engages in it, hoping one day to become, an. en.&#xD;
ployer, a ierant on his own hook. From a hundred dollars&#xD;
a year his' salary is increased to a thousand, but extravagant&#xD;
habits have increased with it.- His board alone costs him two-&#xD;
hundred to four hundred dollars a year. His clothes" are two&#xD;
hundred more. He visits bad houses two or three times a&#xD;

dried dollai-s, when he only gets one thousand. This discre-&#xD;
pancy of five hundred dollus must come out of somebody. As&#xD;
a general rule, a portion falls'on the place where he.boards-&#xD;
his tailor, his bootmaker, and a few others who have trusted&#xD;
him, share the deficiency ainong them. It is bad enough when&#xD;
the salary continues steady; but when a young man who ,has&#xD;
been living at this rate, gets out of a situation, and out of&#xD;
money, in a place like New York, the chances are 'fearfully&#xD;
against him. Temptations surround him on all sides. If he&#xD;
stays in New York, his fall is certain-his degradation sure.&#xD;
He begs and borrows to the full extent of his tether. These&#xD;
sources used up, he has nothing left but to steal. If he'is an&#xD;
American, he will not turn to manual labor, and he will not&#xD;
take menial service. Who ever heard of an American servant,&#xD;
and how far will one travel in New York before he finds an&#xD;
American day laborer?&#xD;
Marion Monek was out of a -situation, yet he had hopes ahead.&#xD;
'Hopes, however, although very flattering stook in one' imagi-&#xD;
nation, will not pay a board bill, obtain a decent suit of clothes,&#xD;
a pair of boots or a hat. The young fellow had a proud spirit.&#xD;
He would not beg if he could help it--he would not have writ-&#xD;
ten home to his parents for aid. He would have out hi's right&#xD;
hand off 'first. The Count occasionally let him have money,&#xD;
and had made Marion promise that he would come to him (the&#xD;
Count,) before he borrowed money, or before he took any neW&#xD;
situation. Consequently Marion was resting upon his oars.&#xD;
The Count Falsechinski had married, and was spending several&#xD;
weeks out of town with his bride: Marion did not know where&#xD;
he was.&#xD;
He had boarded in the house in Nassau street for many&#xD;
months. As we have said before, his room was the -rear-one on&#xD;
the third floor, that of the editor was in the front. Sometimes&#xD;
they talked together, but Marion was very shy of any over-&#xD;
tures. He had no confidence in his own ability to write, and&#xD;
even if he had succeeded as a writer, his prejudices we"ealto-&#xD;
gether in favor of success as a merchant.-he considered it&#xD;
more reputable than success as, an editor. in afterlife his&#xD;
views underwent a great change. He learned to do full jistied&#xD;
to the power and the respectability of the pen.&#xD;
Soon after the marriage of the Count Falsechinski wihh Miss&#xD;
Grasper, Marion Monek settled his :bill with the landladyin&#xD;
Nassau street, and removed, to a Spanish boaarding-hous aiM&#xD;
Fulton street near~ Cliff. It' was kept by a Spaniard nawed&#xD;
Alfayez, who agreed to give Marion-good room~ and a seat at&#xD;

the table for a moderate sum per week. - Marion was a good&#xD;
Spanish scholar, but he wanted practice in speaking it. This&#xD;
was a good opportunity, and he availed himself of it. We have&#xD;
somewhere mentioned that Marion Monck had a great inkling&#xD;
for politics. His sympathies were with the Democratic party,&#xD;
owing probably to the. fact that when a clerk with Mr.. Gran-&#xD;
ville, who was a Whig, he became a Democrat from the mere&#xD;
love of opposition. At that time there were two Committees&#xD;
that regulated Tammany Hall;, one was called the "Old Men's&#xD;
General Committee,'" and the other the "Young Men's General&#xD;
Democratic Committee."    These Committees were elected&#xD;
once a year.- Marion had always been elected to the latter&#xD;
Committee from the, ward in which he lived, and as he was&#xD;
ready with the pen, extremely willing to work, and had no&#xD;
game to play, or spoils to seek after, he was generally selected&#xD;
as one of the secretarAeis of the "Young Men's Committee,"&#xD;
and the work fell upon him, as it always does upon the free&#xD;
horse, his colleague being contented to sign anything that Ma-&#xD;
rion had drawn up or engrossed,&#xD;
On one occasion the Committee had a very exciting debate.&#xD;
A procession was to be got up in reference to a political vic-&#xD;
tory in- Maine or some other State. In this victorious proces-&#xD;
sion several very distinguished military men had volunteered&#xD;
to act as Marshals, but they refused to do so unless all the&#xD;
other marshals were military men.&#xD;
" Very well,"-said the chairman ofdhe Committee. "That&#xD;
matter can be easily arranged. There are to be three mar-.&#xD;
shals from  each ward-make 'em  all military men ;" and as&#xD;
each name of a marshal was proposed and accepted, the chair.&#xD;
man observed, " Make ' Bill Gage ' a general."&#xD;
"Enoch .Camp."-" Make him a major."&#xD;
"Nick Dimond, first ward."-" Make Nick a general."&#xD;
" Bill Dennis," said the Secretary. -&#xD;
"Make Bill a major," said the chairman.&#xD;
"Jde Sweet," called out the Secretary.&#xD;
" Make Joe Sweet a Colonel," dictated the chairman.&#xD;
"Thomas McSpeddon," said the Secretary,&#xD;
"Put General to Tom's name."&#xD;
SWilliam Shaler, sixth ward."&#xD;
"Make Bill Shaler a Colonel-he has been in the wars-&#xD;
and in this ludicrous way the list, which was to be published,&#xD;
was made out, amidst the screams and. shouts of the Taa&#xD;
mnany Hall Committee. When tie list was fairly completed,&#xD;
word was sent to the real Generals, Morris, Wrd, Stryker,&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
353&#xD;
&#xD;
Ircularius, 'and others, that the Committee had placed none&#xD;
but military men on the list of marshals from the different&#xD;
wards.&#xD;
It was late when the Committee adjourned. It was also&#xD;
Saturday evening. Marion passed down Nassau street, and&#xD;
into the Herald publication office. Somewhat unusual it would&#xD;
be now, but at that hour in those days Mr. Bennett was still&#xD;
in the office. The.two commenced a conversation, and in the&#xD;
course of it Marion Monek related the ludicrous debate that&#xD;
had occurred that evening in the committee room in Taminany&#xD;
Hall. It appeared very droll to the editor, and irresistibly&#xD;
comic. He actually held his sides while he roared with laugh-&#xD;
ter. Marion did not laugh at all.&#xD;
"I am going home-good night," said the editor.&#xD;
.Marion returned his "Gobd night," and passed to his Span-&#xD;
ish boarding-house.&#xD;
On his way down, it occurred to him that his month was up,&#xD;
and that he owed the Spaniard twenty dollars that very day.&#xD;
"I am dead broke! Suppose he was to ask me for it?  I&#xD;
have not got five dollars in the world, and the Count is off&#xD;
somewhere. When he will be back, Heaven only knows !"&#xD;
These were the thoughts of Marion Monck as he reached the.&#xD;
door in Fulton street. He rang the bell. 'Alfayez, the pro-&#xD;
prietor, opened it himself: It was an unusual thing for him to&#xD;
do, and Marion expected to be dunned for his bill.&#xD;
He was not doomed to be -disappointed. "You no pay me&#xD;
my money to-day ?"' exclaimed the Spaniard in English. "I&#xD;
want him. You got him now, eh ?"&#xD;
"Sorry to say I have not, Senor Alfayez, but I suppose a&#xD;
few days hence will answer all purposes," asked Marion&#xD;
Monck,&#xD;
No, Senor, he no do two tree days---bym-bye. I want de&#xD;
money. Ahora, what you call now? No do two three days.&#xD;
Hab got him ?" demanded the Spaniard, who had admitted&#xD;
 Marion into the hotel, but seemed disposed to bar his' progress&#xD;
to his room.&#xD;
"Really, Mr. Alfayez, I have not got the money to-night.&#xD;
You are in no danger of losing the amount, although I am com-&#xD;
paratively a stranger to you. My trunks are worth more than ten&#xD;
times your bill. However, to satisfy you, to-morrow you shall&#xD;
have the twenty dollars," said Marion.&#xD;
.KBueno.  Manana;, Senor.  Buenos noches,"-and after&#xD;
this parting salutation, which means " Qood. To-morrow,&#xD;
morning. Good night,"' Marion went up to his room. Where&#xD;

to get the money on Sunday morning was not so clear, and it&#xD;
was a long time before he could get asleep. The next mora"&#xD;
ing Marion Monck rose very early. At the breakfast table he&#xD;
met two sisters, very sweet girls, who spoke Spanish, to  nim&#xD;
upon every occasion. They were lovely creatures from  the'&#xD;
city of Lims, in Peru, aid their father, a grey bearded old&#xD;
Peruvian, was their protector. He, of course, was stopping in&#xD;
the house. These pretty senoritas were aged thirteen and fif-&#xD;
teen, extremely anxious to learn English: Marion Monck had&#xD;
already made a bargain with them that he should teach them r&#xD;
English while they kept him in practice with :his Spanish.&#xD;
Very probably Marion felt anxiety to end the financial war be-&#xD;
tween the Spanish proprietor Alfayez and himself as much on&#xD;
account of these two. extremely beautiful pupils as for any other&#xD;
reason. At any rate, no sooner had he finished his breakfast&#xD;
and smoked a cigar, than he hurried up to the office of the&#xD;
New York Herald. "He inquired for Mr. Bennett.&#xD;
In hisprivate office," was the reply, and thither went Ma.&#xD;
rion Monck.&#xD;
" Good morning," said the editor, and then continued mak-&#xD;
ing some memorandum in a small book. One of the most&#xD;
prominent traits in the character of Mr. Bennett, and which is&#xD;
only known to those who know him as well- as he knows him.&#xD;
self, is his perfect editorial closeness., He does not et his&#xD;
left hand know, what his right hand writes. He will appear to&#xD;
be communicative and frank, and yet what he says is the very&#xD;
frankness of hypocrisy. His hearer gains nothing, obtains&#xD;
nothing from him. 'He will listen unmoved to what he knew&#xD;
before, but the teller will not discover any sign of impatience&#xD;
-or any indication that Mr. Bennett is already aware of what he&#xD;
is telling him.&#xD;
No man in the city of New York is better posted in refer-&#xD;
ence to the affairs of the city, the prominent men in it, or in its&#xD;
various fards than Mr. Bennett. Consequently, when Marion&#xD;
Monck related to him the scene at Tammany Hall, which to a&#xD;
man not familiar with the prominent military and political men&#xD;
of the day, it would have been dry and uninteresting, to Mr.&#xD;
Bennett, who knew the name and character of every man, it&#xD;
was uncontrollably comic and ludierons.&#xD;
When he had finished his work, he turned to Marion Monck-&#xD;
"Well, Marion, what have you got new this morning'?"&#xD;
"Nothing, sir. I have called here this morning for a very&#xD;
particular purpose," said Marion-.&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
356&#xD;
&#xD;
"Indeed. It is raining in torrents, is it notT  What can I&#xD;
do for you ?" Mr. Bennett asked kindly.&#xD;
Marion hesitated a moment.. He had never, since he had.&#xD;
known Mr. Bennett, asked him for a loan of money in any&#xD;
shape, but this morning he felt that he had no other 'resource,&#xD;
and so he replied, "Yes,. sir, it is indeed raining very hard,&#xD;
but the fact is, I am in a tight place. You know I am down&#xD;
at that Spanish boarding-house. My month was up yesterday&#xD;
and unless I get, twenty dollars this morning I do believe the&#xD;
old Spaniard will turn ie out of his house to-day. I could&#xD;
get the money if it was any other day but Sunday. As it is,&#xD;
if you will lend me the twenty to-day, I will return it to you&#xD;
to-morrow,"-and Marion felt relieved, that the application was&#xD;
niade, whatever might be its fate.&#xD;
"No ; I never lend money," was the abrupt reply.&#xD;
"Oh, well, never mind. There has been no harm doie by&#xD;
my asking you. I hated to do it, but I must have money, and&#xD;
stand up to the rack, fodder or no fodder. As it is 'nofodda-,&#xD;
I must try somewhere else," said Marion Monck.&#xD;
"'There is no harm in your applying to me," observed Mr.&#xD;
Bennett, who wrote some thing on a small piece of paper.&#xD;
Marion rose to go. Mr. Bennett held up the paper and o- -&#xD;
served, "Wait a moment.- Here is an order for the exact sum -&#xD;
you wish to borrow. I will not lend it to you. You must&#xD;
earn it."&#xD;
" Earn it! Earn twenty dollars. How in the world am I&#xD;
to do that ?" demanded Marion,&#xD;
" Last night you told me a very interesting story of some&#xD;
doings in Tammany Hall in reference to a Democratic, victori-&#xD;
ous procession that is soon to come off. You made -me almost&#xD;
go into convulsions with'laughter by the funny way in which&#xD;
you told it," continued the editor.&#xD;
" Well," said Marion.&#xD;
" Now, here is my order, for which you can get twenty dol-&#xD;
lars when you go down stairs. There, on that table, is fools-&#xD;
cap paper, -and pen, and ink. Write out what you told me,&#xD;
and the order is yours," coolly remarked the editor.&#xD;
." It will take me all day to do it, and I don't think it will be&#xD;
fit to read then," said Marion.&#xD;
"Never mind that. Do as I say, and do it as near as possi.&#xD;
ble to what you told me, and I shall be satisfied," said the&#xD;
editor.&#xD;
~Marion took a seat and went to work. In less than two&#xD;
hours he had filled ten sides of'foolscap paper. 'He handed it&#xD;

to MDi. Bennett, who did not even pay him the compliment of&#xD;
readb'ig it, but laid it aside, at the same time handing Marion&#xD;
the order for twenty.  He took his leave, and down stairs lie&#xD;
received the money.&#xD;
"I suppose he made me write out all that stuff for tbe pur-&#xD;
pose of affording him an excuse to lend me twenty," thought&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
The next morning, however, when he opened the Herald, he&#xD;
found his article. It made two and a half columns on the out.&#xD;
side of the Herald. It was extreinely ludicrous. It was a&#xD;
point. One of Mr. Bennett's frequent great points, and when&#xD;
his sagacity as an editor was never at fault, either iq the sub.&#xD;
jeet or manner of handling it, no matter how incapable the pen&#xD;
he made use of. There were tens of thousands of military&#xD;
men in New York. There were an equal number of Demo.&#xD;
crats. Such an article, naming the principal leaders in both&#xD;
the political and military ranks, and making them figure in a&#xD;
ludicrous manner, would soon find its way through the streets.&#xD;
At ten o'clock that day as high as a dollar was paid for a&#xD;
"Herald. There were none to be had at any price. It was one.&#xD;
of those millions of original articles that in -a great many years&#xD;
had made the Herald talked about. Mr. Bennett is the most&#xD;
suggestive mind in the United States. He could keep a hun.&#xD;
dred papers filled with original matter if he bad the mechani-&#xD;
cal minds and hands to work under him in sufficient force.&#xD;
The appearance of this article was a matter of astonishment&#xD;
to Marion Mouck. It was the. first newspaper article he ever&#xD;
wrote. He did not believe that he could write one.  Mlr.&#xD;
Bennett had told him that he could. He had made him do it.&#xD;
The article was written. It appeared in the Herald. Marion&#xD;
read it and could not doubt, that he had written it. " It was&#xD;
an accident," he said to himself. "I succeeded by Mr. Ben-&#xD;
nett telling me how to do it. I doubt whether I could do it&#xD;
again." With the twenty dollars he hurried from the Herald&#xD;
office but into the rain and down to the Spanish boarding-&#xD;
house. He called for Alfayez, handed him the .twenty, the&#xD;
Spaniard gave him  a receipt, and a friendship commenced&#xD;
which lasted many years. After paying his bill, Marion passed&#xD;
up stairs to the parlor occupied by the family of the Peruvian.&#xD;
He found the two senoritas pouting because he had not arrived&#xD;
sooner to give them their lesson. The father w4s in his, own&#xD;
room, and dhe old duenna was in another part of the house.&#xD;
The chemrxing pupils, with their long dark locks floating loose&#xD;
over their white and almost naked shoulders and bosoms, sat&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
upon the sofa with Marion between them., For some time the&#xD;
studies went on very smoothly. Marion had procured a bool,.&#xD;
with Spanish and English conversation upon each page. From'&#xD;
this be taught his pupils and they taught -him to pronounce&#xD;
Spanish. Marion finally passed an arm around each of their&#xD;
waists. The youngest, Inez, sprang up and locked the door,&#xD;
saying, "What would the senora say, if she came in and caught&#xD;
us r" and then resumed her 'seat. Marion tried the lips of the&#xD;
sister who had fastened the door, and she returned kiss for&#xD;
kiss with an ardor that surprised him. Then the elder sister,&#xD;
Isabel, got up and poutingly observed that Marion did not care&#xD;
for her, or he would kiss her as well as Inez. This invitation&#xD;
was not lost, and the book was soon laid aside, while Marion&#xD;
gave wpy to the loving kisses and caresses of the two beautiful&#xD;
sisters. They were innocent, and so was' he. What a strange&#xD;
contrast between Ameridan and Spanish girls. Two Americans&#xD;
knight be alone with a young man, and their conduct would be-&#xD;
the same as if their parents were present-they are accustomed&#xD;
to depend on their own self-respect-they are to be trusted,&#xD;
And their conduct would be modest and prudent, without being&#xD;
afraid, of the opinion of their parents. Not so Spanish girls.&#xD;
Thley are watched. They are shown early that they cannot be&#xD;
trusted. They are not allowed to associate with the young of'&#xD;
the other sex. Hence, when a ebance occurs like that with&#xD;
Marion, they only regard the danger of being found out. They&#xD;
fondled their teacher as if he had been a young kitten, and he&#xD;
returned their innocent embraces and kisses. Then 'hey fin-&#xD;
ished their lessons, and he retired to his own room.&#xD;

ble, and.,there be kept perfectly quiet.  No one present had&#xD;
the slightest idea of the real cause of this sudden illness; the&#xD;
doctor pronouneed it a fit of apoplexy.&#xD;
When the unhappy father reached home he refused to go to&#xD;
bed, but sent every one out of the room, except his daughter.&#xD;
He informed Isabella of what had occurred.&#xD;
"4Bell, my heart is broken ; I shall never hold up my head&#xD;
more. If he had died I should have mourned for him, for he&#xD;
was my 'son, although a disobedient one 'but to bring dis-&#xD;
grace upon us all, to marry one of the most notorious courte-&#xD;
zans mINew York,. the very one that ruined my poor brother&#xD;
Tom-Oh, this is dreadful, and I feel as if my senses were&#xD;
leaving me."&#xD;
Isabella was deeply affected, and endeavored to soothe her&#xD;
father, and prevent if possible another fit, for she hiad been&#xD;
told by the physician that any violent agitation would induce&#xD;
a relapse. She sent a note to Colonel Benson, and ere an hour&#xD;
the cool old Englishman was with them. He was more shocked&#xD;
L at what he called Walter's mad infatuation than even the fath-&#xD;
er, whom he advised to break it up. "Get the parties di-&#xD;
vorced, or buy the lady off with a sum of money."  To all of.&#xD;
these suggestions the humbled father turned a deaf ear. "No,&#xD;
Colonel; as-he has made his bed, let him lie on it; I will not&#xD;
interfere-no, net to save his life; it is too ,late now.  He'&#xD;
must have been in New York sometime without my know-&#xD;
ledge; had he come to me at once--had he-but what am:I&#xD;
talking bout ? He is ruined, body and soul, and our name is&#xD;
the laughing stock of all the good and the respectable in New&#xD;
York. If my business was only closed up, I would sell every,&#xD;
thing and go, back to England," said poor Mr. Granville.&#xD;
Colonel Benson urged-it upon Mr. Granville that he must&#xD;
not take the matter too much to heart. . "Bear in mind," he&#xD;
added, "that you have another child and a grandchild--a glo-&#xD;
rious fellow too, who must take your son Walter's place. For&#xD;
their sakes, don't give up."&#xD;
"I will not. I will try not to do so. I will try and forget&#xD;
my unworthy son., But, Colonel, where is my brother Tho-&#xD;
mas ? I must try and find him out. "He too is unworthy of a&#xD;
thought-but, poor devil, he is a fool. He does the best he&#xD;
can, but he is half imbecile, and don't know wrong from right.&#xD;
le must, not starve.' That affair of our old friend Mac Neil--&#xD;
was it not dreadful, to die all alone in the hospital!. Poor&#xD;
Tom, I am afraid he is following in the same direction. I have&#xD;
not heard from him for~ a long time. He must be seen 'before&#xD;

it is too late.' Iate haefrd that he can be found at a' place&#xD;
No. 46 Centre street. I will go there at once.  I feel much'&#xD;
better : will you go  ith me, Colonel ?"h'aked Granville.&#xD;
It as in vainthat Colonel Benson remonstrated, and .tried&#xD;
to persuade his friend'that such a course would be worse than&#xD;
useless.  He- was not  to be persuaded,.and when the Colonel,&#xD;
hoping that his refusal to go. would prevent Mr. Granville from&#xD;
doing so foolish a thing, refused to accompany him, Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville rose and said,&#xD;
Well then, Colonel, I 'will go -alone, and perhaps it is&#xD;
better that you should not go.&#xD;
Isabel tried to dissuade her father from going out, but his&#xD;
mind was fully made up. Colonel 'Benson accompanied him&#xD;
as far as the corner of Broadway and Chambers street, and&#xD;
there they shook hands and parted, the'haughty British Colo-&#xD;
nel wishing his friend success in his present. attempt,&#xD;
When the latter reached Centre street, he commenced ex..&#xD;
amining' the numbers in order to ascertain whereabouts No.&#xD;
46 was located. He was in a quarter of the city with which&#xD;
he was no more acquainted than with the- localities in the&#xD;
neighborhood of the North Pole. . He kept up Centre street&#xD;
on the right hand side. At last hefound the 'right. number,&#xD;
and entered. His striking appearance attracted Jeminy's at-&#xD;
tention the .oment he entered the door.. There was indeed a&#xD;
strong resemblance between the brothers. There were in the&#xD;
store the usual quantity of loafers, and the visiter, after pass-&#xD;
ing his eyes over them, took a seat. Jemmy the bar-keeper&#xD;
had nothad his eyes off the new-comer for a moment. . As he&#xD;
entered he was serving a customer, but when he had finished&#xD;
that duty and placed the money in the drawer, he crossed to-&#xD;
wards where the merchant had seated himself.&#xD;
"Can I 'serve 'to you anything, sir ?' asked JeMy.&#xD;
The merchant laid down the paper.&#xD;
"Yes, if you have any good brandy I would like some in&#xD;
water. I want good---no trash; here is a dollar. If you have&#xD;
no good brandy here, send out for some."&#xD;
" I have some in -a demijohn of the very choicest kind. It&#xD;
was selected' by Colonel Mae Neil, and kept exclusively foi-his&#xD;
use: he was a'judge of -that article, but since,'his death, .no&#xD;
one has used any .of it."&#xD;
How long Jemmy would have gon6 on it is iinpossible to&#xD;
say, but no sooner had the name of Colonel Mae NeiL caught&#xD;
"the ear of the old gentleman 'than -he interrupted him.&#xD;
" aWho did you say-Colonel Mae Neil? what 2did' he Ao&#xD;

hastily.&#xD;
Jemmy was now on his hobby.  He informed his- listener,&#xD;
that Colonel Mac Neil kept a room for fifty dollars a year ; that&#xD;
his old bureau had stood in the rear of that very store until&#xD;
recently, when it was removed to his widow's house. He told.&#xD;
him how the Colonel got hurt, and of the money which the&#xD;
Count Falsechinski had given him; of Mr. O'Doemall, who&#xD;
was last seen to converse with the Colonel-of Marion Monck&#xD;

the next morning, and of finding Mac Neil all bloody; of his&#xD;
being taken to the hospital by young Marion Monek, and how&#xD;
surprised every body about the place was to hear next day that&#xD;
the Colonel was dead..&#xD;
"Not a word more; I cannot bear it, it is too frightful. I&#xD;
knew the Colonel well. Here, my lad. I know you-were very&#xD;
kind to poor Mac; he was a friend'of mine, and a hard fate&#xD;
he had!  Take this and put it in your pocket.  I give it to&#xD;
you out of regard to his memory," and at -the same time he&#xD;
took from from his pocket a roll of money, from which he se-&#xD;
lected a ten dollar bill. Presenting it to Jemmy, who thanked&#xD;
him very warmly, the young man resumed attending to the&#xD;
customers who were cursing at his absence.&#xD;
Mr. Granville continued buried in deep thought.. Occasion.-&#xD;
ally his eyes would glance over the casks and barrels of liquor,&#xD;
but his thoughts were' of a most melancholy character. A thou-&#xD;
sand traits of the amiable disposition of his. friend flashed&#xD;
across his memory, and he soliloquized "Here he kept out of&#xD;
the gay world and his former associates for years; he too, the&#xD;
gallant, wealthy, successful and envied favorite of fashionable&#xD;
society, was reduced to this haunt, and to a room at a dollar&#xD;
a week in the neighborhood. Good God! what may we not&#xD;
all expect ? what may not the most powerful, and wealthy be&#xD;
reduced to! Perhaps it will be my fate : who knows ? -lHre&#xD;
too is a favorite haunt of my poor brother Thomas; well, I am&#xD;
glad I have come here. 1 see things as they are and as they&#xD;
have been. I am learning a lesson in life which I should be&#xD;
long in.learning in my own handsome mansion in  State street."&#xD;
He looked at the different persons in the place. "All of them&#xD;
I suppose have seen better days."  While he was thus re'&#xD;
fleeting, a hand was quietly placed upon his shoulder-it was&#xD;
his brother.&#xD;
He could not speak. Not so, however, Tom ; he took a seat&#xD;
and oommeneed,&#xD;

. "Well, Pitt, how goes the world with you ?"&#xD;
"'So.so, Tom: but you are looking better than I expected.&#xD;
I had heard-but no matter. You are looking well."&#xD;
Tom replied,&#xD;
" Indeed! No thanks to you, though, brother Pitt. I should&#xD;
have looked bad enough had I been dependent on you; but I&#xD;
am glad to see you-heard of your son's marriage ?' asked&#xD;
Tom.&#xD;
Pitt Granville winced as he replied,&#xD;
" Yes, I have heard it, and it pained, me much,; it is a very&#xD;
disgraceful affair."&#xD;
9 Could he do any thing else ? he had no money, and I sup.&#xD;
pose he might have starved if that girl had not taken him up.&#xD;
It is to him I owe my present respectable appearance 'had I&#xD;
applied to you, I presume I might have starved, eh ?" said&#xD;
Tom.&#xD;
"No, Tom, no ; I came here today on purpose to afford&#xD;
you relief if you needed it."&#xD;
"Needed it? .I do need it-need money."&#xD;
Tom said this, for he had become heartless, and had deter-&#xD;
mined to adhere' to his plan of getting gold whenever he could&#xD;
-he felt that something had shaken or softened his brother's&#xD;
feelings, and he was now anxious to know to what extent he&#xD;
could venture a financial demand.&#xD;
" How much do you want, Tom, to make you comfortable ?''&#xD;
asked the brother.&#xD;
" All that you can spare. I want a home, with some money&#xD;
in my pocket besides that which I want to return to Miss Nor.&#xD;
ris, which I borrowed of her."&#xD;
.Tom lied when he added this last.&#xD;
"How much do you owe Miss Norris ?" asked the merchant&#xD;
anxiously and quickly.&#xD;
" What is the use of asking such a foolish question ? Let&#xD;
me have some money, if you intend to do so, and I will then go&#xD;
and pay her," said Tom.&#xD;
The elder Granville took ou~t his pocket book, and handed&#xD;
his brother two hundred and fifty dollars.&#xD;
"Take that,' Tom.  Make' it go as faras you can.  Above&#xD;
all, pay Miss Norris what you owe her. When you need more&#xD;
you can send to me or call upon me. Find some respectable&#xD;
boarding-house, and get settled in it," said Pitt, Grauville.&#xD;
Thomas Granville place-d the money in hi pocket, and  heu&#xD;
his mouth was opened. He informned his 'brother that he had&#xD;
been present at the wedding' o his nephew' without being'&#xD;

&#xD;
aware of it, until the clergyman had made the parties man and&#xD;
wife. Pitt Granville groaned in agony as he listened to the&#xD;
narrative. Tom did not spare his brother from reproaches. He&#xD;
told him that he had driven Walter from his home, and how&#xD;
severely he had been punished for it. .-He then related his&#xD;
own hardships, his want of food, of sleep, of ordinary comforts.&#xD;
But he added, "I thank you, brother,, that even now your&#xD;
heart has relented. It has done me good to see and feel some&#xD;
of the hardships of life, and if I live, hey shall not have hap-&#xD;
pened to me in vain. I willnever be'in such desperate want&#xD;
again." The elder Granville listened, but could say nothing&#xD;
in reply but to beg his brother to come and see him  at his&#xD;
house in State street as though nothing unpleasant had ever&#xD;
occurred. . He shook him cordially by the hand, and remon-&#xD;
strated kindly at his not having a more respectable haunt.&#xD;
Where he had gone Tom exclaimed, "Well, I am      in luck.&#xD;
Who would have dreamed that 1, a poor, devil two days since,&#xD;
that lacked a meal of victuals, wanted a shilling to get a night's&#xD;
lodging, charged with prigging two cents' worth of pie, should&#xD;
now be worth-let me count my fortune. My gold, my yellow&#xD;
slave-five hundred and odd dollars. Well-&#xD;
There is a tide in the Pffairs of men,&#xD;
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.'&#xD;
It is ebb with me. Maybe, whatever I do will turn out&#xD;
lucky. Whatare my lucky numbers?. This is 46. I came&#xD;
here, met my nephew, got clothes, home and board. Good-46&#xD;
is a lucky number. Then Iwent up to that she devil's in&#xD;
Bond street, No. 32. 1 came away with a pocket full of money.&#xD;
Two hundred and sixty dollars in good city bills. 32 is a&#xD;
lucky number. Now, to-day my brother. Pitt wakes up, and&#xD;
comes from a sick bed in No. 9 State street to give me two&#xD;
hundred and fifty dollars. No. 9 is a lucky number. 9, 32,&#xD;
46.6' If I could get -a ticket with those, three numbers upon it,&#xD;
wouldn't it win?  Of course it would. I'll go and try. If I&#xD;
can't get a ticket with those numbers upon it iu the very next,&#xD;
lottery, I will go for once ,into the policy business, and gig&#xD;
those numbers for five hundred dollars.  Jemmy, give me a&#xD;
mild drink. Make it me'ciful.&#xD;
'The quality of mercy is not strained;&#xD;
It droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven&#xD;
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blessed;&#xD;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.'&#xD;
It       James, take a drinks with me. It will do you good. I am&#xD;
going to seek for money. James, when you are poor, never&#xD;
&#xD;
try to borrow. No one will lend a poor man. Get ten dol-&#xD;
lars, and if you wint to borrow a ten, go to your friend and&#xD;
show him that ten, and tell him you have to make up twenty&#xD;
dollars. le will lend you ten. With the twenty dollars go to&#xD;
a second friend,'show him the twenty dollars, and repeat the&#xD;
story, but nake the amount you have to make up fifty, and&#xD;
borrow thirty dollars.  No. 2 will lend you it.  With a fifty&#xD;
you can raise up fast. Show it to your No. 3 friend. 'Char-&#xD;
ley, I have to lend Bill Astor's nephew a hundred this morn-&#xD;
ing. Count that pile and see how much I lack, and then lend&#xD;
it to me like a good fellow.' Ah! Jemmy, you find Charley&#xD;
counts it, and lends you the lacking fifty with pleasure. He&#xD;
would have seen you damned before he would have lent you&#xD;
fifty cents, if he thought you really needed it and had not got&#xD;
it. Jemmy, you have now a hundred. Get it all in sinall&#xD;
bills, except one of fifty, and put that on top. Now go to No.&#xD;
4 friend. Tell him you have to buy'a draft to remit three&#xD;
hundred dollars to your brother in Philadelphia, and only need&#xD;
a.hundred. 'Hand over, old fellow.' No. 4 is not going to&#xD;
count your pile. He sees the fifty dollar bill and a pile. He&#xD;
lends you the money without a word. You have now got two&#xD;
hundred. Take an old bank book and go to some friend who has&#xD;
plenty of money, but who is always on the borrow. Put in your&#xD;
two hundred dollars, and then say to him that you are short to&#xD;
make up a thousand, and if he will let you have three hundred&#xD;
dollars he will oblige you, and you will do as much for him&#xD;
next week. With the three hundred you can travel. Then re-&#xD;
turn the one hundred and ninety dollars that you have bor-&#xD;
rowed respectively from No. 1, ten dollars; *No. 2, thirty dol.&#xD;
lars ; No. 3, fifty dollars ; and No. 4, one hundred dollars.&#xD;
Return all these loans, exhibiting your full stock as you do -o.-&#xD;
With the three hundred dollars in hand, you can borrow three&#xD;
times that amount from your Nos. 1 to 4 friends, with whom&#xD;
you have established a credit. You can travel on this credit.&#xD;
You can victimize one of them occasionally, or increase your-&#xD;
list to ten or twenty friends, of whom, at any time, you. can&#xD;
borrow easily three hundreds, but of whom you could never&#xD;
borrow three cents if you needed it. Jemmy, I am going to&#xD;
try my luck. I have five hundred dollars. I will double my&#xD;
money to-night. I am in luck. See if it is not so. Your very&#xD;
good health."  Thomas Granville finished his glass and left&#xD;

north-west corner of Duane and Chatham streets, where Swee-&#xD;
ney's hotel now stands. In the front office Mr. Clark did an,&#xD;
exchange business. In the rear, partly divided by a low&#xD;
wooden partition, he kept and sold lottery tickets. There was&#xD;
an entrance to this-rear office from Duane street. Into this&#xD;
little cubby place came Tom Granville. le asked to see. some&#xD;
tickets, and they were shown him. He examined wholes,&#xD;
halves, quarters, eighths, in the Pokomoke Lottery, but upon&#xD;
no ticket could he find his combination of 9, 32, and 46. He&#xD;
was then shown the Delaware Lottery. Upon a half ticket,&#xD;
true enough, he found 9, 32, 46. He bought the half ticket at,&#xD;
once, and paid for it five dollars, and left the place. For luck,&#xD;
he placed his half ticket among his roll of bills, and then went&#xD;
up to the "Hotel de Paris,"-entered his room, and laid down&#xD;
to take a nap. When he awoke the light from a street lamp&#xD;
was streaming into his room. He descended to take a cup of&#xD;
coffee, and then carelessly approached Madame Vigne, the&#xD;
landlady.&#xD;
"Madam, I have more money about me than I care to carry.&#xD;
Will you keep it for me ?" asked Tom.&#xD;
"Certainly, with pleasure. How much have you ?" she&#xD;
asked,,&#xD;
"About five hundred dollars, I believe,"-and Tom handed&#xD;
her the roll.&#xD;
"1Five hundred !" repeated the landlady, who, from  Tom's&#xD;
looks,-supposed his deposite might reach about twenty. 'She&#xD;
counted it, and it overran about twenty dollars.&#xD;
"Give me that for spending money," said Tom, and he re-&#xD;
ceived and placed it in his pocket.&#xD;
Thomas Granville had travelled. He knew that there was&#xD;
no safer banker in the world than a careful, prudent French&#xD;
landlady. His money he knew was as safe in Mrs. Vigne's&#xD;
hands as in those 'of th e wealthiest banker of New York. Tom&#xD;
drank his coffee.'&#xD;
"It is a long time-since I have played. I will go and try&#xD;
my luck to-night,"-and so saying he buttoned up his over-&#xD;
coat and went out' into Broadway. He soon found himself in a&#xD;
large gambling establishment in Barclay street. Tom was in&#xD;
luck. When he entered the room the deal was- almost out..&#xD;
Without looking at the state of the game, he put all his money&#xD;
in a roll. He placed it upon the "queen." "My luck is in a&#xD;
lady," was his only observation. The queen won. The amount&#xD;
was counted and paid. .Tom left it lying on the queen. The&#xD;
queen won again. The sum was paid.&#xD;

"There is another 'queen'"in the box yet," said some one.&#xD;
"Then I will leave it all upon my friend the queen," said&#xD;
Tom, dryly. The queen won a third time, dnd Tom placed in&#xD;
his pocket a hundred and sixty dollars, adding, "Now I will&#xD;
get me some supper." He drank sparingly of a bottle of wine,&#xD;
tasted a choice bit of game, and returned to the table., and&#xD;
bought a hundred dollars' worth of red chips.  Then..he&#xD;
played cautiously, and only one or two, until of some particu-&#xD;
lar card, three had been dealt out,- and one remained in the&#xD;
box. Then Tom played fifty dollars on a "bet."  He won un-&#xD;
til he had two hundred and fifty dollars bet on different cards.&#xD;
When the deal was over, he was a winner of over four hun-'&#xD;
dred and fifty dollars.  He had sixty in his pocket.  He re-&#xD;
turned to the hotel, and handing another roll to Madame Vigne,&#xD;
he said, "Here, madam, add this to my sum in your hands."&#xD;
She took the money, but made no comment, and Tom joined&#xD;
old Mr. Gemnrel in a game of dominous. He was perfectly&#xD;
self-possessed-not elated--and when Inidnight came went&#xD;
quietly to bed.&#xD;
Towards evening the next day he went to Clark's exchange&#xD;
office. Mr. Clark recognized him.&#xD;
" You had 9, 32 and 46-half ticket in the Delaware, had&#xD;
you not ?" he asked.&#xD;
"I believe I have that ticket," replied. Tom.&#xD;
"Allow me to congratulate you, sir," said the broker. "It&#xD;
has drawn two thousand fivetundred dollars. The half is one&#xD;
thousand two hundred and fifty. dollars, gross. Discount off&#xD;
will be one thousand .and thirty-one dollars and twenty-five&#xD;
cents. Call here to-morrow, and I will cash the prize and pay&#xD;
you one thousand and thirty-one dollars .and twenty-five cents."&#xD;
Thomas Granville went around to 46 Centre street. JemmI&#xD;
asked him what his luck had been. "I made over a thousand,&#xD;
Jemmy,"-and he told him the particulars.   Tom- did not&#xD;
drink as freely as usual. The next day he received the money&#xD;
from the ticket. He went to Madame Vigne, showed it to her,&#xD;
and received the sum she had on deposit, amounting to over&#xD;
a thousand .dollars. Then Tom took two thousand dollars and&#xD;
went down to the savings bank and, deposited it to his own&#xD;
credit and received a bank book.&#xD;

CHAPTER LIX.&#xD;
Marion Monck and the larpers- Publishes a Book -Virgil Maxcy and&#xD;
Jon C. Calhoun-James Harper and the Ternptrance Societies-To,n&#xD;
Fl'1Ynn as a Lecturer-Mr. Aonck writes him a Lecture on Temperance-Its&#xD;
delivery at the Tabernale -Tor a Delinquent-The Dinnfr ordered by Ar.&#xD;
Fl"nn nd paid for by Mr. Moncek -End of Thomas Flynn, Comedian, in&#xD;
the Almahouse.&#xD;
MARION MONCK felt quite elated 'with the first money he&#xD;
'earned with his pen, and it was but the commencement of ano-&#xD;
ther task. Marion had a friend in Maryland whose name was&#xD;
Virgil Maxcy. This ge'ntleman was a statesman and a scholar.&#xD;
His melancholy fate a few years after th   date of this chapter&#xD;
is fresh in-the memory of thousands. He was an invited guest&#xD;
on board the steamship Princeton, when a cannon burst, and&#xD;
killed Mr. Maxcy and several others.&#xD;
This gentleman had prepared a work for the press.' It was&#xD;
the life of a friend-the great southern statesman, Calhoun;&#xD;
and he wrote to Mari&amp;amp; Monck, requesting him to publish it at&#xD;
the establishment of Harper &amp;amp; Brothers, and to superintend&#xD;
the publication.  Marion accepted the trust, and forthwith&#xD;
made an agreement with the Harpers to publish this Life. at a&#xD;
stipulated price, the copyright to belong to Marion Monck.&#xD;
This was the wish of Mr. 'Maxcy, and it was his desire that the&#xD;
profits of the publication should accrue to Marion, for the&#xD;
trouble it would occasion him to attend to the business, read&#xD;
the proofs, etc.    I&#xD;
Not long after he commenced the work, he received a pack-&#xD;
age of speeches from Mr. Calhoun himself, with a request that&#xD;
he would also superintend the publication of a volume of&#xD;
speeches. This Marion readily undertook; and- in' the .per-&#xD;
formance of the duties, it required him to be a frequent, in&#xD;
fact an almost daily visitor at the establishment of the Messrs.&#xD;
Harpers. One afternoon, as he was about to leave for his&#xD;
boarding-house, he was stopped by one of the brothers,&#xD;
11ave you an engagement to-night ?" he asked&#xD;
It was James Harper.&#xD;
"None in particular," was the reply. "Why do you ask&#xD;
me&#xD;

" Because if you have not, I should' like to have you spend&#xD;
the evening with me," said James Harppr..&#xD;
"Nothing that you could propose would give me greater&#xD;
pleasure," replied Marion.&#xD;
"Then come with me, for I am going home," said Mr. Harper.&#xD;
The two started for Mr. Harper's residence, which was at no&#xD;
great distance from the publishing building. He then resided&#xD;
in Rose street, next door to the Quaker Church. Marion knew&#xD;
the house well, for in the abolition riots, some years before, he&#xD;
had seen the mob enter that identical two story brick house,&#xD;
then occupied by Lewis Tappan, and plunder it of its furniture,&#xD;
which they burned in the street before the door. When they&#xD;
were inside the house, Mr. Harper ordered tea, remarking that&#xD;
Mrs. Harper would not be present, as she was very ill-in&#xD;
fact, dangerously so. She died' not many'dayis after. After&#xD;
tea was finished, Mr. Harper remarked,&#xD;
"9A carriage will be here presently, fo take me where I can&#xD;
fulfil an engagement. I want you to go with me."&#xD;
The carriage came. Both entered it, and continued talking&#xD;
until it stopped before the doors of a church in Forsyth street.&#xD;
" We get out here," said James Harper. "Follow me."&#xD;
Marion did so,.into the church, up to the pulpit. Mr. Har-&#xD;
per opened a 'pew door near -the altar,-and when, Marion had&#xD;
passed in and taken a seat, he shut theAoor and passed to the&#xD;
pulpit, and took the principal -seat. Marion then noticed that&#xD;
the church was crowded with people, called together for some&#xD;
sort of purpose, and that Mr. Harper was to be the chairman&#xD;
of the meeting.&#xD;
The exercises soon commenced, and then Marion discovered&#xD;
that it was the anniversary of a Temperance Society. Prayer&#xD;
was made, a hymn was sung, then a clergyman made a speech,&#xD;
another.hynin, another address and another hymn. Then there&#xD;
was a pause. The chairman then arose, and with great seri-&#xD;
ousness announced that'the Rev. Doctor Tyng was expected to&#xD;
make an address that evening, and added, " But illness in his&#xD;
family will prevent him. This'would be a great disappoint-&#xD;
ment under ordinary circumstances, but I am happy to inform&#xD;
the meeting, that I have secured thd services of a young gei-&#xD;
tleman, who I am sure will, favor us with a short address, that&#xD;
can fill up. the gap caused by the non-appearance of Dr. T'yng.&#xD;
He is extremely clever, and has written a book that my firm&#xD;
have published. I am not aware that he has ever joined any&#xD;
temperance society---very likely he may do so to-night. Allow&#xD;
me to introduce to this audience Marion Monek."&#xD;

VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Marion had followed Mr. Harper's language, wondering what&#xD;
he was driving at'; but when he pounced down upon him by&#xD;
name, and pointed at the seat where he was sitting,. he was&#xD;
completely thunderstruck. .Had the steeple tumbled in upon&#xD;
Jhe crowd, it would not have astonished him half so much.&#xD;
He was so vexed with James Harper, that it gave him the con-&#xD;
fidence necessary to make an address, and he did astonish that&#xD;
crowd for half an hour. He Was really eloquent upon the tem-&#xD;
perance topic, and his address was received with great ap-&#xD;
plause. The services were soon after over, and be again got&#xD;
into the carriage with James Harper, intending to blow him up&#xD;
for. placing him in such a false position. It was of no use. Mr.&#xD;
Harper laughed at him, and when they parted that night, Ma.-&#xD;
riou observed, " Have a care, Mr. Harper; this is the last time&#xD;
you will ever bring me in for a temperance address.",'&#xD;
The next day, when Marion made his appearance in Cliff&#xD;
street, the other brothers had a hearty laugh at his expense,&#xD;
and at the "sell " so successfully made by "Brother James."&#xD;
Marion received it all in good part, and' enjoyed the joke as&#xD;
well as any of them.&#xD;
The Harpers were always interested in the Temperance re-&#xD;
formation. They upheld the "Washingtonian Parent Society "&#xD;
in the gpod old times, when that Society counted upon its&#xD;
books the names of over ten thousand reformed drunkards, and&#xD;
were not sparing in their aid to the Society and its various&#xD;
branches, or to individual members.&#xD;
When the excitement that this Society caused, and which&#xD;
would crowd their, weekly meetings with two and three thou-&#xD;
sand people, had died away, it was followed and replaced by a&#xD;
new order of things, called the Sons of Temperance. Then&#xD;
the Daughters of Temperance. In these movements the Har.&#xD;
pers engaged earnestly, and none more so than Brother James.&#xD;
He was active in all of them, and presided frequently at the&#xD;
annual meetings of these societies. Then came, fie Rechab-&#xD;
ites. In the latter James Harper was a principal leader.&#xD;
To his credit be it said, he was extremely liberal to those&#xD;
who were without means, but who' were willing to aid in the&#xD;
Temperance movement. Goiigh, Wallace, and many others&#xD;
were indebted for means to be useful to Mr. Harper. When&#xD;
Brother James found a person in any particular profession who&#xD;
wds likely to be useful in making converts from that profes-&#xD;
sion, he encouraged him to become a speaker and leader in the&#xD;
great Temperance movement.&#xD;

Chrystie street church, he was engaged in reading some proofs&#xD;
at his own room, when a visitor *as announced. He 'was&#xD;
shown up. This visitor was a stout, thick-set,' full-faed indi-&#xD;
vidual, and he brought a note from Mr. James Harper, intro-&#xD;
ducing him to Marion Monek.&#xD;
"Sit down, sir," said 'Marion.&#xD;
"Certainly -.with pleasure. That note is from Mr, Harper&#xD;
-my very particular friend,. James Harper. He is to assist&#xD;
me in giving a lecture at the Tabernacle, and he told me to&#xD;
come and-see you," said the fussy individual.&#xD;
"I do not see how I can aid you in the matter," replied&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
"Indeed, but I do. -I told Mrs. Flynn this morning, and&#xD;
she is extremely well aware of the fact, that I could and should&#xD;
deliver an extremely interesting lecture, if I had it written&#xD;
for me. There is money to be made in it. Thousands, sir,&#xD;
will crowd to hear Tom Flynn deliver a lecture at the Taber-&#xD;
nacle. The house will be a perfect jam, sir.. Mr. Harper ad-&#xD;
vances-the money. -I shall be a great card, sir-an immense&#xD;
card to the cause of Temperance " said Mr. Flynn.&#xD;
"How long since you joined the movement ?" inquired&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
"Over a week, sir.-nearly two. Now, sir, I 'am an ator.&#xD;
Iam not good at an off-hand speech or lecture, unless I have&#xD;
it all pat beforehand. Now you write out the lecture 'for me-&#xD;
that's a dear good,. fellow. Mr. Harper said you were jqst the&#xD;
chap to do it, and I know you will. I can learn it by heart in&#xD;
a very short time after it is written-that is in  ay line. I&#xD;
shall reform the whole theatrical profession-make :em all join.&#xD;
My lecture will be perfectly overwhelming. When ,will you&#xD;
go to work ? I want it done at once," said Flynn.&#xD;
Marion took a good look at his customer. There was some-&#xD;
thing so jolly about Tom Flynn, that no one could help admire&#xD;
ing him, until they had become well acquainted with the man.&#xD;
Then admiration generally ceased,&#xD;
"WellMr. Flynn, suppose I write this lectuire. You will&#xD;
make money by it. What am I to get for writing it ?" asked&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
"0, anything you please-we won't stand upon trifles.&#xD;
Money to be paid over after the lecture," said Tom Flynn.&#xD;

want you to,,write fifty-a hundred lectures. Harper says I&#xD;
must visit every city in the United States, and deliver my lec-&#xD;
tures, and then go to Europe. Star it on Temp'rance all&#xD;
through England, Ireland, Scotland ando Wales. I will keep&#xD;
you with me, my boy-eh ?  How do you like that?''&#xD;
Marion was in a hearty good hm6r with the illustrious Tom,&#xD;
and agreed to go at once into the matter. To do 'this, it was&#xD;
necessary that he should go to-Tom's apartments. These, Torn&#xD;
said, were at the Sbkespeare Hotel, corner of Duane and Wil-&#xD;
liam street. Accompanied by Marion, Tom wended his way&#xD;
from Fulton street to the Shakespeare." This was kept at that&#xD;
time by a man named -Pierrers, now steward of the St. Nicholas&#xD;
Hotel. Tom Flynn's apartment was on the fourth floor'; and&#xD;
into his room, for he had but one, he ushered Marion Monck.&#xD;
There was a lady seated there, and the new comer was intro-&#xD;
duced with much ceremony to the celebrated and extremely&#xD;
clever Mrs. Flynn.&#xD;
She received Marion with much amiability, and listened to&#xD;
her husband's extravagant ideas of his success in temperance&#xD;
matters with a smile of incredulity. . At that time Mrs. Flynn&#xD;
was a woman of great beauty, and her success as an actress&#xD;
had been long gained. Tom Flynn was doing nothing at all,&#xD;
and the means of support~ were earned by Mrs. Flynn at the&#xD;
theatre in.Chatham street.&#xD;
It was a long time before Marion could get Tom down to&#xD;
common affairs, or the practical business in hand. He had no&#xD;
more idea of a temperance lecture, than he had of Mahomet's,&#xD;
Koran; and would relate theatrical anecdotes, and his own ex-&#xD;
perience, that had no more cennection with temperance than&#xD;
with algebra; and Marion, with a powerful imagination, could&#xD;
not torture or twist any of Tom's stories into. the skeleton&#xD;
ideas for a lecture. At last he gave up in despair, and went&#xD;
to his roon. There the thought crossed him to write a lecture&#xD;
without- the slightest reference to Tom Flynn. He did so. All&#xD;
the experience in it, and thrilling scenes, were purely imagi-&#xD;
Uative-.-none of Ton's, at least. When it was, finished, Ma--&#xD;
rion carried the lecture to Tom's quarters at the Shakespeare.&#xD;
It was read in presence of both Mr. and Mrs. Tom Flynn. The&#xD;
latter approved it, and flattered Marion by telling him that his&#xD;
performance was a most creditable one. Tom undertook to&#xD;
learn it 'at once.                   A&#xD;
Some days passed, and the eventful nig t came, when the&#xD;
Tabernacle doors were opened to admit the celebrated Thomas&#xD;
Flynn to deliver a temperance lecture-" tickets twenty-five&#xD;
&#xD;

cents."  There was a crowd, and notwithstanding an normous&#xD;
quantity of " dead-heads," the lecture 'was a mone -making&#xD;
affair. Tom hired some person to act as treasurer,  d when&#xD;
the lecture was finished, he grabbed the proceeds.&#xD;
Marion Monck went into the gallery to hear hi own original&#xD;
lecture delivered. It certainly made a sensation, and was&#xD;
cheered tremendously.  There was no hunibug about that.&#xD;
Marion felt convinced of one thing. The lecture had sone&#xD;
points in itthat told well on an audience. Tom delivered it&#xD;
well. He had learned it by heart, as though it had been a part&#xD;
of a farce, and it appeared to the audience as though it was&#xD;
extemporized. So far so good,&#xD;
Marion tried to get a sight of Tom Flynn after the lecture&#xD;
was delivered, but Thomas, with seventy or eighty dollars in&#xD;
his pocket, was not to be seen. The next day the' chase con-&#xD;
tinued, and he found the lecturer about three o'clock in a&#xD;
drinking saloon. Thomas was not exactly sober, nor was he&#xD;
very drunk. It was a sort of maudlin medium.&#xD;
" My dear boy, where have you kept yourself? I have been&#xD;
hunting for you all day. Ask Thomas Shortland if I have not.&#xD;
Come now, let us go and have a nice, quiet, old-fashioned din-&#xD;
ner. I have ordered one for us both, and 1et us go to the place&#xD;
at once," said Torn Flynn, and he appeared extremely anxious&#xD;
to get to the dinner. It was an enormous fib, but never mind&#xD;
that. The author and theaactor wended their way over into a&#xD;
Broadway restaurant. * The proprietor placed them in a small&#xD;
room by themselves. When they were fairly seated, and the&#xD;
dinner had been ordered, Mr. Monck boned Tom about the&#xD;
twenty dollars.&#xD;
"Bless your heart, my dear bov, I had to pay onti every&#xD;
cent. You have no idea what a time I have had-! Wasn't it&#xD;
a capital house? fHow they did cheer! My fortune is Iaide.&#xD;
I've struck a vein. Harper says he never saw anything like&#xD;
it. Mr., Harper advanced the.rent of the building, but I had&#xD;
so many demands made upon me for money to-day, that I can-&#xD;
not refund him his advance. It is a hard case, ain't it?  But&#xD;
those Ha,'pers are rich-he won't feel it. When willyou com-&#xD;
mence another lecture for me, Mr. Monck:9" said Tom.&#xD;
Marion Monck was really indignant; and he replied angrily,&#xD;
 I'lltll tl you what it is, Mr. Flynn, I don't consider this fair&#xD;
treatment. I wrote your lecture for you. You have made&#xD;
money, and I expected to have received the twen'tf'dollars at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
" You are perfectly right, my boy. I don't blame-you-not&#xD;

a bit of it. I'd feel just the same, if a man had used me as&#xD;
shabbily as I have you. I know it is outrageous. You ought&#xD;
to have had the money. But what am I to do?  You see-how&#xD;
I am placed.. Dead broke-but never mind, we will have a&#xD;
good dinner, any how. I expect it will be a magnificent din-&#xD;
ner. Do you know I like good dinners ? What do you say to&#xD;
a bottle of Champagne, eh ?"&#xD;
"I am agreed," replied Marion ; "but what would your&#xD;
temperance friendssay if they were to 'drop in upon you--&#xD;
James Harper, for instance ?"              *1&#xD;
"0, he be blamed. It will not do for me to break off so&#xD;
sudden from all stimulants. It must 'be done by degrees,"&#xD;
replied the actor.  0&#xD;
The wine was ordered-not one bottle but two was placed&#xD;
upon the table. A splendid dinner was served up, for Tom&#xD;
Flynn knew how to order a good dinner. It was well cooked.&#xD;
It was a dinner that any gentleman in the land might have been&#xD;
proua to have partaken of. Under its genial influence Marion&#xD;
became reconciled to the disappointment connected with the&#xD;
twenty dollars. Tom promised faithfully that he should have&#xD;
it in less than twenty-four hours. Still Marion refused to&#xD;
write a second lecture until he received pay for number one,&#xD;
and he added, " Flynn, you can make money as a temperance&#xD;
lecturer, if you will deliver twenty lectures written by me, and&#xD;
do as you have done this one, by each new one. Learn it by&#xD;
heart. By the time you have committed twenty lectures to&#xD;
heart and can deliver one on call, you can then practice on all,&#xD;
and really you will have matter enough to deliver an extempore&#xD;
lecture apparently, merely throwing in a few local facts or&#xD;
matters whenever you deliver a -lecture at a' new place. You&#xD;
will succeed, and you will be a popular lecturer, but you must&#xD;
pay me honest, every time I write you a lecture. It was very&#xD;
wrong in you to 'do' Mr. Harper out of the Tabernacle rent,"&#xD;
said Marion.&#xD;
"It was bad-very bad---a 'd--. shame. But it can't be&#xD;
helped 'now, and I dare say Mr. Harper won't mind it. What&#xD;
a glorious dinner we have made, eh ? Is there any thing else&#xD;
you will have'? Order whatever you have a fancy for-wines,&#xD;
cigars, coffee-d   the expense. . One may as well be in for&#xD;
a sheep as a lamb," said Tom.&#xD;
Here the landlord came in, and was very polite to Marion.&#xD;
He asked if there was any thing else he could put upon the&#xD;
table. ".Nothing more," was the joint reply. When the&#xD;
proprietor of the restaurant passed out from the little, room&#xD;

where the author and actor had cined, Tom Flynn followed&#xD;
him, and, after an absence of a quarter of an hour (during&#xD;
which time Marion was extremely an xious, for he had no mon-&#xD;
ey, and he feared Tom had departed, leaving him in a strange&#xD;
place to foot the bill), he returned rubbing his bands in great&#xD;
glee, and exclaimed, "Lord love your soul, my boy. It is all&#xD;
right. I told him who you were, and he said you could pay&#xD;
the bill whenever it suited your convenience. I takes me,&#xD;
don't it ?"&#xD;
Marion was indignant, and at first could not comprehend&#xD;
what Tom Flynn was driving at. "'I! Satisfied with me ?&#xD;
*What the devil have I got to do with it? It is your, dinner.,&#xD;
You ordered it," said Marion.&#xD;
"That is true. But keep perfectly calm-what difference&#xD;
does it make ?' I have no money-not a dollar. The bill is&#xD;
twelve dollars twenty-five cents. He wouldn't trust me twelve&#xD;
cents. I have satisfied him that you are as good as .the Bank&#xD;
of France ; that James Harper, or all the Harpers, would be&#xD;
responsible for fifty dinners; and that you were short to-day&#xD;
for a wonder, but would call, back to-morrow and order a dozen&#xD;
dinners, le is perfectly satisfied, andwill let us go out without&#xD;
the money. Don't be afraid,",continued Tom Flynn, consolingly.&#xD;
"Hang your infernal impudence! You told him the Harpers&#xD;
would pay my bill! that I was short-that-that--0, the&#xD;
devil! You have played Ned with me. It is bad enough to&#xD;
stick me for the lecture, but then to stick rae for a dinner&#xD;
that I never ordered, and tell a parcel of lies in order to induce&#xD;
the proprietor not to have us arrested, or kick us out of doors,&#xD;
is too bad. Tom Flynn, I will never forgive you-.never,&#xD;
said Marion.&#xD;
" Nonsense, 'my boy. We are all right. I've fixed it with&#xD;
the proprietor. -Says yow-can pay it any time you like. What&#xD;
else can I do ?" asked Tom.&#xD;
"Else can you do?  You had no business to cone here, or&#xD;
induce me to come here, unless you could pay for what you&#xD;
ordered. But I have done with you-nmark that.!"  Marion&#xD;
indignantly left the room, and went to the proprietor and told&#xD;
him how he had been stuck for the dinner. The landlord&#xD;
enjoyed the joke, and the next day larion paid the bill.&#xD;
To return to Tom Flynn. He delivered his lecture several&#xD;
timeso-once in Jersey City. He did well, but he cold not&#xD;
keep from drink. It eventually fetched him, as it has millions&#xD;
K of good fellows, and Thomas Flyn died in the Almshoue of&#xD;
New York city.&#xD;

Rforrtion of Thomas Granville- The Tfotcl de Paris-The r Dmino Ciul&#xD;
-Bruce--Trinity Church Anecdote-Thie Beautfeil French Girl Clotide&#xD;
-Ton's Second Marriage-Ris Death at the Staten Island Small Pox&#xD;
Buspital.&#xD;
ALAS, alas,! poor Tom Granville! gifted with genus, with&#xD;
kindness of heart, with every thing which could make thee a&#xD;
worthy member of society, what a melancholy fate -was thine !&#xD;
Why was this?   He had .thoroughly reformed, and changed&#xD;
his habits from being a careless spendthrift into becoming a&#xD;
miser, and he counted every cent he expended, and incurred&#xD;
no outlay that.he could do without.&#xD;
In a former'Chapter we have related the manner in which&#xD;
he had accumulated the sum  of two thousand dollars. This&#xD;
was deposited in the Savings Bank, and the bank-book, as evi-&#xD;
dence of its being his property, he carried about with him at,&#xD;
all times, and not a day passed that he did not take it out and&#xD;
gaze earnestly at the items inside of it.  He dressed neatly,&#xD;
and continued to board at the 'Hotel de Paris,' in Broadway.&#xD;
Unexceptionable in his conduct, he foreswore houses of ill-&#xD;
fame, gambling, and excessive drinking; lie had his bottle of&#xD;
claret daily at dinner, and drank sparingly even of that.  As&#xD;
he dined with his brother every Sunday, during the week he&#xD;
would occasionally call in State street and invite his. niece to&#xD;
promenade with him upon the Battery. - If she did not go her-&#xD;
self, she permitted one of her children, for she had now three.&#xD;
fine boys to go with ' Uncle Tom.' Such conduct won upon&#xD;
Pitt Granville, and he no longer hesitated about giving Tom&#xD;
money, nor even wait to be asked, but would frequently say,&#xD;
"Well Tom, how do you fight your men ?  Have you any&#xD;
ammunition left ?"&#xD;
Tom never replied in the affirmative; but always laughed&#xD;
and plead poverty.&#xD;
"I am about broke, but luckily my expenses are not much."&#xD;
To such a hint there was but one reply-&#xD;
"Take this, Tom; perhaps you can spend it," and Tom&#xD;
would get a twenty or fifty dollar bill. After such financial'&#xD;

&#xD;
successes, Tom would g to his hotel, and make a special de-&#xD;
posite with his landlady, keeping in his own pocket a few shil-&#xD;
lings for his wants.&#xD;
Thomas Granville visited almost every place of amusement,&#xD;
but he was on the free list, and did so without expense. He&#xD;
neither courted nor avoided the society of those with whom he&#xD;
had been formerly intimate in his prosperous. days, and con-&#xD;
sequently they once more sought his society -for he dressed&#xD;
with care and taste, and his social habits made him always an&#xD;
agreeable companion. -But on such occasions he never spent&#xD;
a fraction upon them ; if he dined or drank with them, it was&#xD;
at their expense, not his own.&#xD;
After being present at the wedding of his nephew with&#xD;
Miss Norris, he avoided them as he would poison.  le howev.&#xD;
er changed his deportment toward Marion Monk-he not only&#xD;
treated him kindly, but sought his society,: and many an hour&#xD;
the two passed together in playing dominoes at the 'Hotel de&#xD;
Paris,' where Tom originated a Dominoe Club. Besides them-&#xD;
selves, there were men of some note that belonged to that club.&#xD;
Mr. Bruce, for many years the confidential clerk of old John&#xD;
Jacob Astor,.and after his death holding the same position&#xD;
with his son, William B., was of this club.&#xD;
Mr. Bruce was acharacter in his way. No man knew New&#xD;
York for forty years better than he did-he knew every house&#xD;
and building below Houston street, and was a man who solved&#xD;
a difficulty in an unequalled manner. Upon o'ie very extra-&#xD;
ordinary emergency, Mr. Bruce was called upon by a vestry-&#xD;
man of Trinity Church.&#xD;
"Bruce, the Corporation intend to open Pine street through&#xD;
to Albany street, and it will cut through our graveyard; what&#xD;
can be done to prevent it? Suggest something."&#xD;
'Mr. Bruce thought for a few moments, and then replied&#xD;
"Trinity is rich, and don't mind spending monev. Go to&#xD;
work at once and put up in the graveyard opposite fine street&#xD;
where'the proposed cut will go through, a costly monument to&#xD;
the memory of the American Patriots whp fell or died at Wall-&#xD;
about Bay.  Give out that the bones of these Revolutionary&#xD;
heroes were buried under -the monument.  Do that, and you&#xD;
will have no further bother.  The Corporation are not bold&#xD;
enough to dig up the bones of Revolutionary heroes'"-&#xD;
The vestrymen of old Trinity saw the wisdom' of the hint.--.&#xD;
At their next meeting the monument was decided upon, and&#xD;
workmen commenced their labors at the head of Pine street.-&#xD;
Bruce was right.-there stands 'the monument, and fiQ street.&#xD;

has yet disturbed it, or the bones of the Wallabout heroes,&#xD;
which probably repose some four miles off.&#xD;
But to return to Mr. Bruce. He was posted upon every&#xD;
subject, and to an editor of a daily paper would have made a&#xD;
valuable assistant as a suggestive editor.&#xD;
Another member of this club was Aaron Turner, one of the&#xD;
most remarkable men in New York. He was nicknamed "the&#xD;
Doctor," from his unVarying attention to any of his friends'who&#xD;
became sick. One of' the club was once confined to his room&#xD;
for thirty days-the "Doe" never left him. When the regular&#xD;
physician had given the patient over to death, Doctor Turner&#xD;
interfered, and by feeding the dying man upon rare, half-raw&#xD;
beefsteak and old.port wine, brought him around again, and he&#xD;
is still a member of the Dominoe Club.&#xD;
'he. Doctor had an income of 'two thousand dollars a year.&#xD;
Half he spent on himself, and religiously devoted thpe other&#xD;
half to the relief of suffering humanity.  No man kndws how&#xD;
the Doctor lives, nor where he lives, and no man ever saw him&#xD;
do any regular business-and yet he is a master of all trades&#xD;
and all sciences. He can paint a picture, or -he can -set up&#xD;
thirty thousand ems of type aHweek with ease. He once navi-&#xD;
gated a schooner from Chagres -to New York, and not many&#xD;
months afterwards, when a passenger on the Erie railroad, and,&#xD;
the engineer and fireman were both killed, he mounted the en-&#xD;
gine and ran her and the train eighteen miles to Port Jervis.&#xD;
Old James Gemmel, the rich watchmaker in Broadway, was&#xD;
a member of the ,lub for many years. Ue is dead now, and&#xD;
has gone to a better world, where dominoes are not permitted.&#xD;
There were others of the Dominoe Club. Some are now living,&#xD;
and some are dead, but we omit mention of the former because&#xD;
they are cashiers in bank or Judges upon the bench, and those&#xD;
who are dead are of no account in the 'game.'&#xD;
Tom Granville was a great admirer of the game of dominoes&#xD;
and of. the society which it brought nightly around him&#xD;
One evening he came into the room. where his friends were.&#xD;
playing, and there he found Mirion Monck; he seated himself&#xD;
at the centre table and called for. a cup of coffee, observing,.&#xD;
"Gentlemen, I will take a hand in the next game with you.&#xD;
I have seen a leper to-day."&#xD;
"A leper !" was repeated by a dozen members of the club.&#xD;
"Yes, gentlemen, I have seen and conversed with a genu-&#xD;
ine leper to-day.---no mistake about- it. I myself had doubts&#xD;
about there being any lepers in this country, but I was mista-&#xD;
ken. Listen to me, incredulous ones, and believe me. I was&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
turning up into the Bowery from Chatham Square, on the left&#xD;
hand side as you go up, and at Pell street-a little bit of a&#xD;
street which empties into the Bowery near Chatham, I was de-&#xD;
tained a moment. I there saw a man surrounded by a lot ot&#xD;
curious boys; he was seated upon the ground, and his face was&#xD;
like a leper. I started the boys off, and then cross-questioned&#xD;
the individual. I gave him a quarter, and suggested that his&#xD;
face was covered with leprosy.  He confessed 'it at once-.&#xD;
what do you think of it, eh ?" asked Tom triumphantly.&#xD;
- "Is leprosy catching ?" inquired Mr. Gemmel..&#xD;
"Pooh, pooh, no. It is nasty, but not catching, replied&#xD;
Tom.&#xD;
Marion Monck had listened attentively, and when the story&#xD;
about the leprosy was finished, said,&#xD;
" Mr. Granville, did you ever see a man with the small&#xD;
pox ?"&#xD;
"No, I never did-and what is more, I never wish to, for I&#xD;
have never had it myself; but what the devil do you ask such&#xD;
a disagreeable question for--who is talking about small pox,&#xD;
and what has that got to do with my leper that 1, was telling&#xD;
you about ?"&#xD;
.All the company shuddered at the suggestion. Marion. re-&#xD;
plied calmly,&#xD;
" I asked if you had ever seen a case of the sNnall pox, be-&#xD;
cause I have been informed that before it breaks out, the ap-&#xD;
pearance of the face of the person who is infected bears very&#xD;
much the appearance of him who in Eastern climes is affected&#xD;
with the leprosy-that isall."&#xD;
"Indeed! Come, don't let us say anything more about&#xD;
small' pox or leprosy, it makes nme nervous," replied Tom.&#xD;
So the subject was dropped, and just at that moment Madame&#xD;
Vigne came to the table and requested Tom to accompany her&#xD;
to the supper room. Supper was on the table, 'but there were&#xD;
no guests partaking of it, and Madame and Tom were engaged&#xD;
in earnest conversation. Of the nature of that conversation we&#xD;
will give an idea before finishing this chapter.&#xD;
Not a week had passed after Tom became a permanent oc-&#xD;
cupant of this hotel, before a creature made her appearance&#xD;
behind the bar whose beauty was of a kind that startled as&#xD;
well as captivated at first sight.  Granville had- risen very&#xD;
early that morning and descended the stairs ; he went to the&#xD;
bar to address Madame Vigne, but the face that beamed upon&#xD;
hia made him exclaim, "CGood heavens, who are you ?" The&#xD;
person thus addressed was a girl evidently not over fifteen&#xD;

years old, and girlish in every action. Her hair was jet black,&#xD;
and combed back. from a large alabaster forehead and gathered&#xD;
up in a close knot that was as large as one third of the girl's&#xD;
magnificent head. Her skin was perfectly transparent, and&#xD;
the clear white and red were only visible. She had a Grecian&#xD;
cast of features. and her smile exhibiting a pair of delicate red&#xD;
lips and snow white teeth, was irresistible.  Her form  was&#xD;
beautifully proportioned-a full bosom and small waist, and her&#xD;
movements were grace itself. She walked with that lithe and&#xD;
limping air, which in a young and beautiful girl has a powerful&#xD;
charm. She did not understand a word of English, but Tom&#xD;
spoke French as well as English.&#xD;
They were alone in the room, and when Tom questioned her&#xD;
closely, she informed him that she-had come from France not&#xD;
many months previous with her mother. She was from   the&#xD;
very province in France of which Lyons -is the capital. She&#xD;
had been frequently a visitor to that city.. Tom  could de-&#xD;
scribe every building in it, and this at once was an interesting&#xD;
topic of conversation between them. Her name was Clotilde.&#xD;
She informed Tom Granville that her mother had recently died,&#xD;
and that " Madame,'' so she called Mrs. Vigne, had agreed to&#xD;
support her, and she, in return, was t tend the bar and wait&#xD;
on such customers as called -for coffee. Tom became really&#xD;
eloquent to the beautiful Clotilde.' He told her of the dangers&#xD;
.--f the attractions of her beauty-of the insults she would re-&#xD;
ceive, and finally asked her if he, Tom, would get Mrs. Vigne&#xD;
to give up the idea of her tending bar, whether she would agree&#xD;
to it.&#xD;
"I have money, and I will pay Madame Vigne, your board,&#xD;
rather than you should be exposed to 'be gazed at and in-&#xD;
sulted," said Tom.&#xD;
The honest, heart-felt interest Tom expressed-had its effect.&#xD;
The poor girl's eyes opened to the widest extent as she re-&#xD;
garded Tom's speaking features. She was interested, and&#xD;
months of ordinary intercourse could not have made Clotilde&#xD;
so deeply grateful as that morning's conversation. Tom  told&#xD;
her where his room was, and added, -" For your own sake, I&#xD;
shall avoid conve'rsing "much with you while you are behind&#xD;
the bar. When y.ou receive a signal from me, make your es-&#xD;
cape and come to my room."  The girl agreed to do so. That&#xD;
day Tom remonstrated with the Madame agsnst employing the&#xD;
girl in the bar-room, but it made no impression upon her mind.&#xD;
He offered to pay her hoard. That Madame listened to. The&#xD;
beautiful girl was employed as bar-tender for several days, but&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
879&#xD;
&#xD;
her ignorance of money and the trouble her presence occasioned&#xD;
among the boarders, who all became in love with her, made the&#xD;
Madame anxious to withdraw her from such services.   She&#xD;
talked with Tom Granville 'about it, and he again repeated his&#xD;
offer to pay her board.&#xD;
"Very well, Mr."Granville, I agree, to it on one condition.&#xD;
You shall tell me why you do this-why you care about her-.-&#xD;
and what are your, intentions. I have' a right to ask these&#xD;
questions, for the leetle girl is under my charge."&#xD;
"Certainly you have, and as my intentions are not wrong, I&#xD;
will tell you. You know that I have money.', Very well., If&#xD;
you will keep this girl in the house, and ft her go to school, I&#xD;
will pay all her expenses. When I find that she likes -me, I&#xD;
will marry her. Is that enough ?" asked Tom.&#xD;
It was more than enough. Madame at once summoned the&#xD;
fair object of so much trouble, and informed her of what Tom&#xD;
had proposed.&#xD;
I love Monsieur Granville now with all my heart and&#xD;
sgul," was the frank respose of the giri. In fact, not a da&#xD;
had passed that she had not been' to Tom's-rooin-and held'a&#xD;
conversation with him. Not a band-or a finger had Tom placed&#xD;
upon her.. Not a single caress at their interviews, and the&#xD;
young French girl who had expected, and was prepared to re-&#xD;
pel them, was agreeably disappointed, and these facts combined&#xD;
with Torn's fascinating manners, had won her heart. When&#xD;
other borders had been civil to her, or made love to her, she&#xD;
had repelled -them with as much scorn as if some great wrong&#xD;
had been proposed to Tom. When Tom had the conversation&#xD;
with Madame, and she agreed to his proposition, Clotilde was&#xD;
at ones taken out of the bar. She became a sort of companion&#xD;
to.the Madame, and Tom, with her sanction, went'out with Clo-&#xD;
tilde about every night, and visited some place of amusement.&#xD;
She was delighted. Tom told her to regard herself as his&#xD;
wife, and to ask for money, and he proffered all she needed&#xD;
from week to week. One night he had been with her at tho.&#xD;
opera,.where her extreme beauty had attracted the attention&#xD;
of all in the vicinity. As they were returning home, linked&#xD;
arm in arm, Tomn asked her if she would marry him. Clotilde&#xD;
replied at once.  She would do so then.or at any time.  Tom&#xD;
Granville pressed the white hand that reposed in his own, and&#xD;
begged her to'listen to his story. He then told her of his wife&#xD;
-gave the entire history, and again asked the sweet French&#xD;
girl if she would marry him..&#xD;

"I love you more than ever, because you have.been so badly 3,&#xD;
treated by that proud woman," replied Clotilde.&#xD;
Tom was delighted; but honest. He then informed Clotilde&#xD;
that his wife had procured the divorce, that she could marry&#xD;
again, but that he could not, and explained the divorce laws to&#xD;
the best of his ability. He told her that were he to go and&#xD;
marry her, he would be liable to be punished for bigamy. .The&#xD;
wild girl replied.&#xD;
"Then, Monsieur Thomas,.do not marry me, but I will be&#xD;
your wife, and you shall be my husband. I love you. I am&#xD;
yours, and death only shall separate us."&#xD;
When-they reae  d the hotel, Tom proposed that they should&#xD;
confide in Madam,Yad to her Tom told his history.&#xD;
"Then I will marry you," said the sympathising landlady.&#xD;
"Do you write a. paper solemnly promising that you will take&#xD;
Clotilde, support, live with, and be-a father to her children, if&#xD;
she has any, and that your will give her all your money if you&#xD;
die, and swear to it on the Holy Evangile, and' put' in it that&#xD;
you would marry her in. church but for the reasons you have'&#xD;
told me you cannot ?  Clotilde shall write another paper, and&#xD;
sign it, and promise to be your faithful, good wife. You also&#xD;
snake a will before a lawyer, that if you die you leave all you&#xD;
have to.'Clotilde, and when you have both doue this, then 'you&#xD;
shall leave these papers in my hands, and I will pronounce you&#xD;
to be mati and wife, and then you and she can do what you like&#xD;
and amuse yourselves as you please."&#xD;
All went to bed that night pleased. The next day Tom re-&#xD;
ligiously executed the papers, and so did Clotilde. Madame&#xD;
changed Clotilde from her old room to one that adjoined Tom's,&#xD;
and which communicated by a door, the two rooms having been&#xD;
occupied formerly as a parlor and a bed-room. No noisq was&#xD;
made. All was done quietly, and not a soul was the wiser of&#xD;
these matters but Madame herself, and Tom Granville found&#xD;
himself the actual possessor of one of the loveliest girls that&#xD;
France had ever sent to these 'shores. Tom admired his new&#xD;
wife. He found her as charming in mind as she was in person,&#xD;
and she returned his love with ardor, for it was her first love,&#xD;
and she worshipped him. - A few days after their occupying&#xD;
the same apartments, Tom playfully told her that she was a&#xD;
perfect copy, made by Nature of the " Venus de Medicis," and&#xD;
added, "I want to see your hair fall as Natureamad'e it." . She&#xD;
undid the fastening, flung it loose, and the dark masses, when&#xD;
she leaned slightly backward when standing, swept the floor-.&#xD;
Tom caressed her, and while playing and tanghing it, observed,&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Dear Clotilde, I was not deceived.  The-first time I met&#xD;
you, I was attached to you by your hair."&#xD;
"But, Tom, it was all done up in a tight knot. Ahow could&#xD;
you tell whether it was long or short, thick o thin ' - she&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"My eyes could not deceive me in the beautiful ornament,&#xD;
my dear Clotilde," replied Tom.&#xD;
Tom became really happy. He had some thing to love, and&#xD;
some thing to love him. His stern economy can now be ae&#xD;
counted for. The extra expense incurred by his beautiful com-&#xD;
panion was nothing. The Madame merely added a few dollars to&#xD;
his monthly board, and Clotilde Granville was her companion&#xD;
when Tom was out, or when engaged in the domino--roott. At&#xD;
the. table she ate her meals with Madame and her'husband, and&#xD;
Tom continued to take his at the same time. Thomas Gran-&#xD;
ville had been thus pleasantly situated for some weeks when&#xD;
the occurrence took place in reference to the lesson which wv&#xD;
have narrated at the beginning of this chapter. The pleasant&#xD;
arrangement between Thomas Granville and Clitilde had some&#xD;
drawbacks. Tom' accompanied' her whenever she went out,&#xD;
and her beauty attracted great attention. Tom's friends made&#xD;
many inqiries as to who she was. His roue acquaintances&#xD;
tried hard to get an introduction. ' It was all in vain.&#xD;
Early one morning Tom, accompanied by Clotilde, was saun-&#xD;
tering upon the Battery. He had pointed out to his companion&#xD;
the house occupied by his brother, when that same bother&#xD;
stood suddenly before them. Tom was not often taken by sur-&#xD;
prise, and without a moment's hesitation he introduced Clotilde&#xD;
as Madame Michel. Never did a more perfect lady stand upon&#xD;
the Battery, and Pitt Granville was sensibly aware of it. Hel&#xD;
was a gentleman' when he chose to be so, and immediately of-&#xD;
fered his arm. Tom 'explained that Madame Michel had but&#xD;
recently arrived to look after some property of her husband,&#xD;
who had died in Martinique, where the widow was-bound; that&#xD;
he knew her in France, and was agreeably surprised to' meet&#xD;
her here at the Hotel de Paris, where she was stopping. Clo&#xD;
tilde had learned English from Tom to an'extent that enabled&#xD;
her to express a few words very prettily in English, and Pitt&#xD;
Granville talked on as though she understood all he was say-&#xD;
ing. At last he invited them over to breakfast  This Toniex.&#xD;
plained to the lady, but prudently declined, giving a satisfac-&#xD;
tory excuse. Before Pitt Granville parted from  them, he&#xD;
placed some money in Tom's hands, and 'after his departure&#xD;
Tom handed it to Clotilde, and then returned up Broadway to.&#xD;

the hotel. Clotilde could not conceal her satisfaction at having&#xD;
met with Tom's brother.&#xD;
" What shall I do with so much money as you 'give me?&#xD;
Every week it isa great deal. All you have given to Madame&#xD;
she has given to me.  I pay all our bills.  I pay for nice&#xD;
dresses for myself, and yet we have plenty left. I have more&#xD;
than four hundred dollars in my pocket-book."&#xD;
Tom found that his brother Pitt had given him a hundred;&#xD;
and the next day he took Clotilde to the Savings Bank, and&#xD;
had four hundred more passed to bis credit. The teller also,&#xD;
at Tom's request, gave a new book, placing all Tom's money,&#xD;
amounting to about twenty-four hundred dollars, in such a&#xD;
manner that Clotilde Michel or himself could either of them&#xD;
draw the money on presenting the book. He explained the&#xD;
matter fully to Clotilde after they left the bank. She was,&#xD;
amazed.&#xD;
" Do you mean to say that in case I should take that little&#xD;
book, and go to that bank without you, that they would pay me&#xD;
all that money-twenty-four hundred dollars ?' asked Clotilde,&#xD;
" Every cent of it, pet, and ask you no questions. - It has&#xD;
been. placed to your credit as well as to mine. So we must&#xD;
take good care of the book," said Tom.&#xD;
The French girl was very much affected. Such generosity&#xD;
surprised her. " Why have you done this ?" she asked.&#xD;
" To make you comfortable in case of my death. I know&#xD;
you would never rob me of it, or abuse my confidence in your&#xD;
integrity and virtue. Clotilde, I want to see you placed above&#xD;
want, in case of accident to me. You love me, and you make&#xD;
me very happy.- What is a few hundred dollars with what&#xD;
you are to me---a fond, loving friend ?" said Tom, earnestly.&#xD;
. The Frencl4 girl wept. She fully comprehended Tom, and&#xD;
she determined that she would make him happy as long as sbe&#xD;
lived, and she did.'&#xD;
There are many of the then, boarders at the Hotel de Paris&#xD;
who are now living, 'and who will well remember a tragedy&#xD;
that occurred in that hotel, and which originated with this fair&#xD;
French girl. A young Frenchman came out.froin France, and-&#xD;
stopped at the Hotel de Paris. He had a room on the same&#xD;
floor with Tom, and directly opposite Tom's. room. le had&#xD;
seen this-young girl, as he supposed, and jfpll madly in love&#xD;
with her-regular French frenzy love. He offerea money to&#xD;
Clotilde to marry him. Of course, her mind was filled with&#xD;
Tom Granville, and she rejected all overtures from the young&#xD;
TFrenchman with scorn.. He knew nothing of Tom Granville,&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.                     g3&#xD;
and he consulted Madame Vigne. She told young Paris to&#xD;
keep quiet, and assured him that he had not a show to gain the&#xD;
affections of her young countrywoman.&#xD;
On Sunday morning the young Frenchman wrote a letter to&#xD;
Clotilde. She at once handed it to Tom. The letter was re-&#xD;
turned to young France. 'Soon after Tom descended to the&#xD;
bar-room, and was in the act of lighting his cigar, when one of&#xD;
the waiters rushed down stairs and said that young France fiad&#xD;
blown his brains out. Tom and Madame Vigne hurried u&#xD;
stairs to the suicide's room. He had strength enough to say&#xD;
that he had been despised by Clotilde, and life was no longer&#xD;
valuale.&#xD;
"Poor devil, [*hat- a melancholy fool !" quietly observed&#xD;
Tom, as he went to Clotilde's and his own room, and they&#xD;
locked themselves in, while he explained the tragedy. A&#xD;
coroner s jury was called; and as the young man had in his&#xD;
trunk over a thousand francs in gold pieces, he had a superb&#xD;
funeral. The jury rendered a verdict in accordance with the&#xD;
circumstances, without the slightest idea of the real state of&#xD;
the case. Thomas reflected upon the matter like a philosopher,&#xD;
but Clotilde scouted' the idea of such foolishness as any man&#xD;
killing himself on her account.&#xD;
This tragedydecided Tom to move his quarters, and to take&#xD;
Clotilde with him. The very day he met the "Leper " man&#xD;
he had been looking for a part of a house in the eastern part&#xD;
of the town. Some days passed, and meanwhile Clotilde went&#xD;
with him to look at the house he proposed renting, when an&#xD;
event occurred that destroyed all housekeeping projects.&#xD;
Tom complained of being ill, and kept himself in his room&#xD;
for a day or more. Marion Monck called, and Tom ordered the&#xD;
servant to bring him up stairs to his apartment. Clotilde was&#xD;
with him, and refused to leave the room. When Marion en-&#xD;
tered, Tom received him. cordially, and after a short conversa-&#xD;
tion, made him take a seat closer to hin.&#xD;
"Marion, do you know that I have fretted myself about that&#xD;
'Leper ' I told you of. I am satisfied that the man has the&#xD;
small pox."&#xD;
The last words he whispered in Marion's ear.&#xD;
" Good'GodI You don't think so, really ?&#xD;
" I do."-and what is more, I have caught it."&#xD;
" Nonsense ;" replied Marion. " But I will go and 'bring&#xD;
.you a doctor."&#xD;
," That you may do ; and mind, if I have' it, will you see me&#xD;

hotel. Not a word to a soul, remember."&#xD;
Marion promised, and then left the room, and immediately&#xD;
.went for Doctor Carnochan, a physician as well known to Tom&#xD;
as himself. The doctor came, and pronounced upon the case&#xD;
at once. It was the small pox. And now shone out the worth&#xD;
and the devotion of a true-hearted woman. It was decided&#xD;
that Tom should be- taken at once to Staten Island.. Clotilde&#xD;
refused to leave him. Marion went down to the Island and&#xD;
made all the necessary arrangements, and that very afternoon&#xD;
Tom was conveyed to the Staten Island Hospital, and Clotilde&#xD;
was by his side as his nurse. She did not leave him for a&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
Marion returned t9 the city, and informed Madame Vigne of&#xD;
the real state of the case. She was alarmed,.but kept the mat-&#xD;
ter secret. Tom's apartments were fumigated, and no other&#xD;
case occurred. Mr. Monck visited the Island and made daily&#xD;
inquiries after Tom,.but did not see him. A week told the&#xD;
story. Thomas Granville was dead.&#xD;
While he was ill, Clotilde never slept but for an instant or&#xD;
two at a time. He was raving and did not know her; but just-&#xD;
before he died, he became perfectly sensible. He knew her.&#xD;
"God bless you, my own dear Clotilde. 1 It is hard to part&#xD;
with you, hard to part with life, just as I have learned how to&#xD;
live and to enjoy it; and you, of all the world that I have known,&#xD;
are the only one by my side in this awful crisis. Don't weep&#xD;
-don't quiver. Bear up as -well as you can. When I am&#xD;
dead, go and draw the money in the bank for your own pur-&#xD;
poses. It is your. If there is any objection, the will I made&#xD;
and gave Madame Vigne is good. That is not all. When a&#xD;
week has elapsed, go to my brother, and tell him all. Tell&#xD;
him how you have been devoted to me to the bitter end of my&#xD;
useless life, and he will be softened-.:-he will-O, my God !-&#xD;
it's dark-get a light-Jesu  -&#xD;
Clotilde had lifted his head up, but with the partly uttered&#xD;
word of our Saviour's name, he fell back upon the pillow a&#xD;
corpse, and his nurse-the beautiful Clotilde, faithful to the&#xD;
last, fell senseless upon his body.&#xD;
She witnessed the burial of Thomas Granville, which, was&#xD;
solemn and immediate. Then she left the hospital where- he&#xD;
had died, and.came up to the city, a stern, beautiful woman.&#xD;
She was no longer the passionate, loving, laughing\ girl. She&#xD;
went directly to the Hotel de Paris, and the Madame gave her&#xD;

week, and then called on Pitt Granville. He was bowed down,&#xD;
and took poor Toni's death much to heart. She narrated all&#xD;
that had passed, and showed Tom's bank book and his will and&#xD;
the other papers. Mr. Granville rang the bell, and then or-&#xD;
dered the carriage.&#xD;
"I will go with you to the Savings Bank,' he added; and&#xD;
when the carriage was ready, they entered it together, and pro-&#xD;
ceeded to the bank. Mr. Granville was well known there. He&#xD;
asked if there would be any difficulty in Clotilde receiving the&#xD;
money-the twenty-four hundred dollars&#xD;
None whatever. Whenever she wishes she can draw it&#xD;
out," replied the official.&#xD;
"Then add this to her credit in the book," said Mr. Gran-&#xD;
ville; and when Clotilde saw the entry in the book, she dis-&#xD;
covered that Tom's brother had given her twenty-five hun-&#xD;
dred dollars. He begged her to use his name* and to call upon&#xD;
him whenever he could be of service to her; and he conveyed&#xD;
her to the Hotel de Paris in his own carriage, and there left&#xD;
her. He never saw her again. Neither did Clotilde remain&#xD;
but a few days longer at the Hotel de Paris. She then left,&#xD;
and what her fate was did not transpire for many year.&#xD;
Our readers may be anxious to know what that fate was.&#xD;
Twelve years after the event of Tom Granville's death, a&#xD;
beautiful woman called upon Marion Monck. She had just re-&#xD;
turned from California, where she had amassed a large pro-&#xD;
perty. She called herself Mrs. Granville, and she went with&#xD;
Marion to a French banking-house and bought bills of exchange&#xD;
on Paris to the extent of eight hundred thousand francs. She&#xD;
was older, and more majestic than formerly. She went to&#xD;
France, but what became of her is a mystery; and what bad&#xD;
been the manner of her earning so large a property in Califor-&#xD;

Tom Granville was soon forgotten, attd our narrative will now&#xD;

LXI.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Globe HotI and Blancard-John O'Doemall-The Colonel Claibfoot&#xD;
and Lady Clairfoot-A Horrible Seduction and Robbery of 43000-The&#xD;
Bloomingdile Asyluin and an Inmate.&#xD;
Fo. many years a large hotel called the Globe Hotel"&#xD;
was maintained inthe lower part of Broadway. It was located&#xD;
a few' doors below Wall street, extended from Broadway to&#xD;
New street, and the name of the proprietor was "Blancard."&#xD;
At this hotel Mr. O'Doemall was sometimes a boarder,mbut&#xD;
at all times a visitor. The "Globe" was the home of many&#xD;
distinguished Englishmen, who came to this country to travel,&#xD;
or of English officers on their way to Canada, or on their&#xD;
return from Canada to England.&#xD;
To this hotel came an English lieutenant-colonel, with his&#xD;
wife. He was on his way to Canada, and had arrived in the&#xD;
city in the month of January. It was bitter cold weather.&#xD;
His name was Clairfoot. Among the first acquaintances he&#xD;
made was Mr. (O'Doemal. The latter-gentleman in the most&#xD;
disinterested  manner informed Colonel' .Cairfoot that the&#xD;
weather was so cold in- Canada that he 'stood in dariger of&#xD;
freezing to death. This had no effect, so far as the colonel&#xD;
was concerned, but it alarmed him on account of his wife, and'&#xD;
he became anxious that she should.not accompany him; and&#xD;
the more so- as his stay in Canada was not positively determined.&#xD;
He 'might be able to get "through the military, business with&#xD;
which he was intrusted in a few weeks, and he mightbe de--&#xD;
ined months. In the latter case, he knew that he could&#xD;
speedily send to his wife to join him in Canada, whenever he&#xD;
might be located for any length of time. When Colonel&#xD;
Clairfoot had decidedrupon this course, he consulted with his&#xD;
friend O'Doemall in reference to procuring handsome apart-&#xD;
ments in'a private hou e. He did not like the idea of leaving&#xD;
his wife at a- public hotel. Mr. O'Doemall soon procured the&#xD;
desired quarters for, the lady, and to them the colonel removed.&#xD;
The house was a boarding-housp in Chambers street, and the&#xD;
colonel had taken the whole of the second floor for his lady.&#xD;
She was a peer's daughter, and, of course, a lady in her own-&#xD;
right. She was a very fine showy Englishwoman-not over&#xD;

&#xD;
twenty-five years of age, while the colonel was a man who had&#xD;
nearly reached fifty. In the course of the proceedings, O'Do-&#xD;
emall had been introduced to Lady Clairf t, and when the&#xD;
colonel left for Canada he partly entruste her to the care of&#xD;
his friend O'Doemall, who on his part promised to do all and&#xD;
every thing that could possibly conduce to the 'comfort of the&#xD;
lady. The colonel started for Canada quite satisfied with his&#xD;
arrangements. His wife had money in her own right when he&#xD;
married her, besides ample funds left with her by the colonel&#xD;
for her own use. She bad brought a letter of credit upon the'&#xD;
agents of the Rothschilds for three thousand pounds sterling.&#xD;
A knowledge of these facts had been picked up by O'Doemall,&#xD;
and no sooner had his friend the colonel started for the North&#xD;
than O'Doemall went adroitly to work to carry out his plans and&#xD;
purposes, whatever they may have been. He found out the&#xD;
weak points of Lady Clairfoot in a very short space of time.&#xD;
He. soon managed to get up a quarrel between her ladyship&#xD;
and the family in whose house she had rooms, while he appar-&#xD;
ently was the pacificator and friend of the landfady. The lad&#xD;
was induced to have her meals in her own apartments, and Mr.&#xD;
O'Doemall continued to be a regular visitor both at the dinner&#xD;
hour and at tea, for hardly an evening passed that he did not&#xD;
escort her to a place of public amusement. After the play wa&#xD;
over, Lady, Clairfoot--...who was extravagantly fond of a good&#xD;
hearty supper, which she couldnot get in her boarding-house&#xD;
-would accompany O'Doemall to "Taylor's," "Thompson's,"&#xD;
or some other well-known restaurant., She 'was gay and lively,&#xD;
perfectly innocent, and somewhat independent, and just the&#xD;
person with whom   a gentlemanly unprincipled rascal like&#xD;
O'Doemall could'make, rapid headway.&#xD;
Fortunately, for the success of Mr. O'Doemall's efforts to&#xD;
victimize the worthy lady, her husband was detained in Canada&#xD;
from day to day, and as he was not a great letter writer, and&#xD;
expected to return speedily, he. did not write his lady at all.&#xD;
It is useless to conjecture the arts used by such a ian as&#xD;
O'Doemiall to destroy a woman.le could resort -to the very&#xD;
basestin the seducer's calendar, and there is no doubt but&#xD;
that some vile drug was used to accomplish his designs upon&#xD;
Lady Clairfoot. She had accompanied him to the theatre,&#xD;
then to a supper, and from thence to her home., At her home&#xD;
he persuaded her to join him in a glass of bottled ale, of which&#xD;
he had sent to her room a dozen bottles, with a story that.he&#xD;
Ladsnported it himself from London. She drank one or more&#xD;
lass and ten remembered nothing more until she awoke&#xD;

the next morning in her sleeping apartment, and Mr. O'Doem.&#xD;
allwas by her side. The lady was indignant, and the man was&#xD;
impudent. She threatened, and he coaxed until she became&#xD;
aware that further efforts against him were futile. She was in&#xD;
his power, and she submitted. He had obtained, under vari.-&#xD;
os -pretences, all ,the ready money she had with her, and when&#xD;
she asked from O'Doemall sufficient to pay her board at the&#xD;
house, he made frivolous,lying excuses about his having used&#xD;
her money until his own remittances came. She believed him,&#xD;
and then he suggested that she should draw on her letter of&#xD;
credit,&#xD;
He accompanied her 'to the agent of the Rothschilds, and she&#xD;
took up a hundred pounds. Mr. O'Doemall had now the lady&#xD;
under his control. He persuaded her to leave the house where&#xD;
she had been placed by her husband, and he engaged rooms&#xD;
for her in a distant part of the city. :'There they lived as man&#xD;
and wife.&#xD;
Mr. O'Doemal had had an understanding with the bankers&#xD;
that they would cash her drafts, if brought 1y him, without re-&#xD;
quiring her presence. Again she signed a draft for a hundred&#xD;
pounds. She did not read the draft, and with pei'fect reckless-&#xD;
ness she plunged into every species of dissipation. i-He intro-&#xD;
duced to her a man named John James (since in the Illinois&#xD;
State Prison for forgery), also an Englishman by some pdistin-&#xD;
guished name, and then O'Doemall introduced cards, and the&#xD;
lady lost. In giving a draft to O'Doemall for the usual amount&#xD;
of a hundred pounds, as Ahe supposed, she actually signed a&#xD;
draft for one thousand pounds. This money O'Doemall placed&#xD;
with a respectable commercial firm as his own.&#xD;
Not a night passed that all hands were not engaged in some&#xD;
revelry. Lady Clairfoot was hardly ever sober, and she drank&#xD;
apparently to drown remorse. Again was she induced to draw&#xD;
for money. Again did she sign a draft for a very large amount,&#xD;
supposing it a small one, and .this game was played success-&#xD;
fully until all the money, excepting two hundred pounds, had&#xD;
been drawn out by O'Doemall, and secured over two thousand&#xD;
Pounds, or about ten thousand dollars to his own credit in the&#xD;
hands of this responsible commercial firm, with whom he had&#xD;
never been known to have had any dealings.&#xD;
O'Doemall was hardly sober a moment, except when it was&#xD;
necessary to accomplish his plans. His partner, John James,&#xD;
had no knowledge of the extent of the villainy which was being&#xD;
perpetrated upon Lady Clairfoot. Mr. James supposed that&#xD;
O'Doemall was victimizing her to tigexteat of a few hundred&#xD;

pounds, and he was satisfied with a sinall share of it. Had he&#xD;
known the game. was thousands, he would have claimed more.&#xD;
3r. O'Doemall was not asleep in reference to Colonel Clair-&#xD;
foot. He felt guilty, and knew there would be a terrible reck-&#xD;
oning when the Colonel made his appearance in New York&#xD;
and was informed of the facts. He kept Mr. James constantly&#xD;
employed in seeking news of the Colonel's movements. He&#xD;
himself changed his haunts, and when he- had obtained and se-&#xD;
cured two thousand pounds, and had, besides, seven hundred&#xD;
dollars in cash, he made up his mind to abandonthlayo&#xD;
her fate, and quit theacity until the storm blew over&#xD;
One of his haunts was the Shakespeare Restaurant, then&#xD;
.kept by Windust. Here he was found by'. Mr. James one&#xD;
morning quite intoxicated, and utterly incapable of taking care&#xD;
f himself.d Mr. James informed him that Colonel Clairfoot&#xD;
had reached Now York,. and was at the 11 beHte.      Ti&#xD;
alarming news produced no effect upon the hearer, except to&#xD;
make him extremely pugnacious. He was at once desirous to&#xD;
go and fight Coloel Clairfoot, and avenge his wrongs and pro.&#xD;
tect Lady Clairfoot. Lekily, he was too drunk to get 9ff his&#xD;
chair or to walk across the bar-room without assistance.&#xD;
anr. Janieswas in a quandary. lie dreaded an explosion or&#xD;
an explanation, for he was fearful that lie should be called up-&#xD;
n to disgorge, or perhaps explain before a magistrate his share&#xD;
in the infamous seduction and plunder of the English lady.&#xD;
Under these circumstances lie passed into the street, hoping&#xD;
to-find assistancereHe-hadnot proceeded more than a block&#xD;
before he encountered Marion Monck. O'Doemall had once&#xD;
introduced Mr. James to Marion, and now he renewed the ac%-&#xD;
quaintance. Marion received his advance somewhat coldly.&#xD;
Ho knew nothing of Mr. James,, except as a friend of Mr.&#xD;
O'Doemall, and snce the robbery .of Colonel William  Mae&#xD;
Neil lie had been unable to free his wind from an impression&#xD;
that OlIDoemall was the robber, and indirectly the assassin of&#xD;
the Colonel. 'r. Jaies asked Marion if he was disposed to&#xD;
do an act of kindness for one who had been friendly to him&#xD;
when sick.&#xD;
"Most certainly. Who is he ? and where is he ?" inquired&#xD;
Marion .                                    /&#xD;
It is Mr. O'Doeinall. He is down in Windust's cellar, ex-&#xD;
treel dek.And that is not all; he has been drinking for&#xD;
several weeks, and unless he is placed under -immediate. r&#xD;
sta, , fear he will injure himself or some one else.. He is&#xD;

&#xD;
now so drunk he cannot stand. He has plenty of money about&#xD;
him," observed Mr. James.&#xD;
Marion was about to say "Send him to the hospital," when&#xD;
poor Mae Neil's hasty fate crossed his mind, and he hesitated.&#xD;
Has he nobody to look after him ?" he asked.&#xD;
"Not a soul but me," replied James.&#xD;
Marion thought that Mr. James was not a very trustworthy&#xD;
friend, and he at once offered his services. "Take me to&#xD;
O'Doemall," he said. The two descended to the cellar where&#xD;
O'Doemall was seated, his head lying upon the table.&#xD;
"Hullo, old fellow, what is wrong with you?  Wake up, and&#xD;
speak to your frieLds. Mr. O'Doemall, I say," said Marion.&#xD;
The drunken man roused up. "I tell you I have not got the&#xD;
lady's money," said O'Doemall, and then recognizing Marion,&#xD;
who had spoken to him, and who was shaking him, he added,&#xD;
"Why, Marion, is that you?  I have not seen you for ages.&#xD;
What is out!?"&#xD;
"Nothing out, O'iDoemall, except yourself. You are all&#xD;
out. You are drunk. You mu3t go with me," added Marion.&#xD;
" Mr. James, will you clear out, and leave me with my fiend&#xD;
Monck," said O'Doemall.q&#xD;
Mr. James went to the extreme end' of the room.&#xD;
"That'is a inost infernal rascal, Marion Monck  Have a&#xD;
care of him. I am sober-quite sober. You don't believe it.&#xD;
Very well. I have got a great deal of money with me. Count&#xD;
that,"-and as Mr. O'Doemall said this he pulled out bill after&#xD;
bill, and when one pocket was emptied he tried another, and&#xD;
when Marion finished counting the money so placed upon the&#xD;
table, he observed," Why, O'Doemall, you have over sik hun.&#xD;
dred dollars with you. It is not safe to carry such a large&#xD;
amount With YOU."&#xD;
I know it. yI wish you to take it, and keep it for me. Will&#xD;
you oblige me? You are as safe as the Bank of England.&#xD;
That's a good fellow. I am not sober, and I am not drunk. I&#xD;
have not slept for many nights. I have been' worried very&#xD;
much," said O'Doemall.&#xD;
Marion took all 'the money except the. surplus over the six&#xD;
hundred, which he handed to O'Doemall. "I 'will keep it,&#xD;
O'Doemafl, but some thing must be done for you. You are&#xD;
very ill. The fact is. you require good nursing, or you will&#xD;
die," said Marion.&#xD;
,T am perfectly aware of it," replied O'Doemall. "Can't.&#xD;
you take me to some nice place-in the country, for instance,&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
391&#xD;
&#xD;
where I can be out of the way until'I get well? You can pay&#xD;
the shot out of my money."&#xD;
Marion agreed to the proposal. He went at once to Mr..&#xD;
James, and told him his plans. Mr. James was delighted.&#xD;
" Nothing could be better," he exclaimed with delight.&#xD;
Marion did not see what there was to be delighted about,&#xD;
but he told Mr. James to go and engage a carriage to go out a&#xD;
few miles into the country. The carriage came, and O'Doemall&#xD;
and his two friends entered it. Marion handed the driver a&#xD;
ten dollar bill, and told him where to drive and what to do,&#xD;
and shortly after the carriage and its contents were on their&#xD;
way to Bloomingdale. When they reached the gates of the&#xD;
asylum, Mr. O'Doemall was asleep. Marion got out, and went&#xD;
up to the- building. There he paid sixty dollars, or three&#xD;
months' board for their patient, whose namp was duly entered.&#xD;
Marion Monck fully explained the case,.and satisfed the chief&#xD;
physician that it was all right. He then returned to- thecar-&#xD;
riage, and almost immediately it was driven inside and up the&#xD;
main entrance. Servants came out of this country hotel to as-&#xD;
sist the guest to Is quarters. Mr. O'Doemall was woke up.&#xD;
He gazed at Marron, then at the'hotel. Memory recalled a part&#xD;
of his previous conversation, and he exclaimed with glee, " Ab,&#xD;
you have done as I requested. Got me a country hotel. Where&#xD;
is it ? What's the name of the place ? Let's go in and get a&#xD;
drink, and then I will go to bed."&#xD;
They entered the hall. O'Doemall began to notice some&#xD;
things. It was too late. "Good-bye," said Marion; "I will&#xD;
come and see you in a few days."&#xD;
"I say. Stop. What does this mean ? Keep your hands&#xD;
off me,"-and with a hundred oaths and protestations and re-&#xD;
quests to be let loose, Mr.. O'Doemall was sent, or rather&#xD;
dragged to his apartinents. He was a patient in the "Bloom-&#xD;
ingdale Asylum," vulgarly called a mad-house.&#xD;
Marion Monck and Mr. James returned to the city. Had&#xD;
the former dreamed that his humane intentions were to be the&#xD;
means-of letting a villain escape from the punishment he so&#xD;
richly merited from a wronged husband, he mould have cut off&#xD;
his own hands for the act.&#xD;
It was so. Colonel Clairfoot made.every effort to discover&#xD;
O'Doemall.. Mr. James went-over to Jersey. and staid three&#xD;
months, to keep out of the way. There was no clue to 6'Do-&#xD;
emall's retreat. The husband found -his wife almost a maniac.&#xD;
Lie learned how deeply he had been wronged, and how largely&#xD;
she had been robbed of honor and -of money. But time was&#xD;

precious. He waited a mouth to catch theracal O'Doemall.&#xD;
He was not to be found anywhere. Satisfied that he had es-&#xD;
caped his vengeance, the Colonel and his lady returned to&#xD;
England. What became of her was never known by any one&#xD;
on this side of the water. He was heard of some  ears after.&#xD;
for he committed suicide in the city of Dublin without any ap-&#xD;
parent cause (so the papers stated that gave an account of the&#xD;
melancholy transaction).&#xD;
Marion Monok was, of course, ignorant of any transaction of&#xD;
a guilty nature in which O'Doemall had been engaged.  He&#xD;
supposed he had drank to excess, and placed him where he&#xD;
was safe.&#xD;
A week elapsed before he visited him, and then he lred a&#xD;
carriage, and taking with him the balance of the money left in&#xD;
his hands by O'Doemall, he went out to the Bloomingdale&#xD;
Asylua. That visit and the finale of our history of Mr. O'Do-&#xD;
email must be left for another chapter.&#xD;
CHAPTER LXII.&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson-Mr. Bennett sends Marion ,Mnck to South Carolina&#xD;
as Correspondent of the Herald-Two Months with Mr. Calhoun-De-&#xD;
parturefrom Charleston for New York, and Safe Arrival with Mrs. Fer-&#xD;
YUSon.&#xD;
RaE and unfrequent were the visits that Marion Monck&#xD;
paid to the comfortable residence of Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. He&#xD;
was ever. welcomed there by both husband and wife, and it&#xD;
would be difficult to decide why ,so old a friend did not visit&#xD;
them oftener. There was one reason, however, which Mariou&#xD;
hardly understood himself. He was not at home in the pres-&#xD;
ence of Mrs. Wilson. He remembered the young wife of Mr.&#xD;
Nordheim, and there was something he could not forget-and&#xD;
yet he could hardly understand what that something was. The&#xD;
Count Falsechinski, who was a perfect man of the world, had&#xD;
on one occasion enlightened him as to the past feelings of Mrs.&#xD;
Nordheim, but yet he could not reconcile the opinion with the&#xD;
fact, that thewidow Nordheim had married Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
It was a happy marriage.  They had become parents to two&#xD;
children, both boys, and the second one was named "Marion."&#xD;
Marion Monck had called up one evening, and Mrs.. Wilson&#xD;
announced the fact to him in the presence of her hiisband.&#xD;
-We have named our second darling after you, Mlarion, and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
393.&#xD;
&#xD;
the young gentleman's name is Marion Monck Wilson. We are&#xD;
not unmindful that we owe our happiness to you. Had it not&#xD;
been through your instrumentality I had never known my 'pre.&#xD;
sent lord, and I am grateful, Marion.  We only wish that you&#xD;
could point out to us some way in which we- could really be&#xD;
useful to you. We desire anxiously to see ou settle down in&#xD;
life. You have sown all your wild oats. You have a marked&#xD;
capacity for business ; and let me beg of you, dear Marion, to&#xD;
think seriously of what I say. You have not two truer friends&#xD;
in this wide and wicked world, than Mr. Wilson and myself."&#xD;
There was feeling expressed in these few words from the lips&#xD;
of -the graceful woman, which reminded Marion of old times,&#xD;
and he was affected deeply. He replied,&#xD;
"If it would give you any pleasure to see me settled, I can&#xD;
only wish that I was in a regular business. I hope soon to be.&#xD;
The Count Falsechinski has hinted to me an arrangement, by&#xD;
which I shall soon have a partner, with plenty of cash capital.&#xD;
I am under a promise not to mention any names, or I would&#xD;
tell you more."&#xD;
" That is good news. The Count is in a situation to make&#xD;
good any promise that he gives," said Wilson.&#xD;
"Are you aware, Marion, that we are going to 'move into&#xD;
the country ?" asked Mr s. W ilson.&#xD;
6 Indeed I was not. To what part of the- country are you&#xD;
going ?"&#xD;
" To the Connecticut village where I staid during the chole-&#xD;
ra year. We are not going to break up in town. You remem-&#xD;
her my aunt, Mrs. Ferguson, in Charleston--of course you do;&#xD;
we have written her to come on and make a permanent home&#xD;
with us. She will keep the house in the city, and we shall&#xD;
only be absent during the hot summer months. It'is better&#xD;
for the children. Poor boys, I cannot bear to have them&#xD;
cooped up in town, when 'there is fresh and pure air to be'had&#xD;
by a short journey."&#xD;
When Murion made these visits he was asked all sorts of&#xD;
questions about those persons they had mutually known, and&#xD;
in this manner an evening passed very quickly and happily to&#xD;
all parties.     Mro,      ol   eaddb      h  ayi h&#xD;
" Come oftener, Marion,"would be added by the ladyin the&#xD;
kindest manner when he was leaving, and he would inake up&#xD;
his mind that his visits to this delightful family should hence.&#xD;
forth be more frequent. But something always turned up to&#xD;
prevent it. He was literally very busy-doing nothing. He&#xD;
wrote-occasionally, and he idled still more, but his niind was&#xD;

constantly employed. He would sometimes go to an old haunt&#xD;
and remain there for hours, drinking a solitary glass, and then&#xD;
he would dream out a thousand beautiful thoughts and fancies.&#xD;
He thought much, and though he had no definite- plan but to&#xD;
pass away the time, and the stimulus' he drank helped out his&#xD;
ideas and thoughts,'yet he never wrote them down. He thought&#xD;
them, and they pleased him, and were stowed away for use in&#xD;
after years. In these places he saw. life.  He listened to the&#xD;
conversation of others without mixing in it, and whether these&#xD;
conversations related to a dog fight or a rise in cotton, he&#xD;
gleaned information.er-tewsto&#xD;
Sometimes he visited. drinking places where the worst of&#xD;
the male sex congregated, and often had he volunteered to&#xD;
keep the slate when a lot of -thieves were raffling for the first&#xD;
chances in the fruits of joint. robberies.  He was thanked, ne-&#xD;
ver molested, and often invited to drink. The slang language&#xD;
of these people, and their motives -of conduct, amused. him.&#xD;
When he had a few spare dollars he would go to a new spot,&#xD;
where poor broken-down drunkards congregated, men who had&#xD;
not a copper towards paying for a three cent drink. Here he&#xD;
would pick up and stow away in his iron memory any quantity&#xD;
of useful information. He would treat, and treat, the strange&#xD;
crew until his funds were exhausted, and the men themselves&#xD;
wondered at such folly And extravagance. 'But he gained his&#xD;
point.. He was deeper into the mysteries of life after all such&#xD;
night expeditions.&#xD;
One lovely April morning, Marion Monck was passing up&#xD;
Nassau street, when he was met by the editor of the Herald,&#xD;
The latter asked in his hasty manner,&#xD;
"Well, are. you doing any thing '"&#xD;
"Nothing in particular.".&#xD;
"Will you go South for me . asked the editor.&#xD;
"What to do ?" asked Marion.&#xD;
I wish you to travel through the Southern States, or at&#xD;
least to spend the summer months in your native State, South&#xD;
Carolina, and, write me a series of letters giving me all sorts&#xD;
of information"-its agriculture, manufactures, society, scenery,&#xD;
great inen and little men; in fact, about every thing; will&#xD;
you go ?"&#xD;
"1I will: when do you wish me to start ?" asked Marion.&#xD;
" At once., Come up to theoffice and I will give youarfunds.&#xD;
Leave to-day if you can, and go by the land route to Charles-&#xD;
ton. From that point I wish you to commence writing me&#xD;
letters," said the editor.&#xD;

&#xD;
"I will be ready in an hour, and will then come to your of.&#xD;
floe," replied Marion.&#xD;
"Good morning-that will do," and theyparted.&#xD;
Marion went at once to his boarding house, packed his&#xD;
trunk, paid his bill, and made arrangements that his trunk&#xD;
should be sent to the Philadelphia depot at five o'clock.&#xD;
An hour after he was at the Herald office,, received the ne-&#xD;
cessary funds from Mr. Bennett for his journey, and generali&#xD;
instructions as to what he was to do, and then bade him fare-&#xD;
w ell.                         -t  h    r s e t o  e v n&#xD;
Marion Monck was delighted with the prospect of leaving&#xD;
New York; he was sick of the city, and beside the prospect of&#xD;
several months to be passed away in pleasant travel, he was&#xD;
to see his parents once more, after an absence of many years.&#xD;
lie did not bid any one good bye, but wrote a note to Cont&#xD;
Falsechinski, and another to Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, informing&#xD;
them of his pur ose.&#xD;
The journey Was a pleasant one, passing through Philadel-&#xD;
phia, Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, and Wilmington,&#xD;
North Carolina, by land, and thence to Charleston by steamboat.&#xD;
He reached Charleston the fourth day after leaving New York.&#xD;
The next day he went up to the residence of his -parents at&#xD;
Monck's Corners. To give any idea of the reception he met&#xD;
with there-would vastly exceed our limits. He found his pa-&#xD;
- rents and aunty older, but still hale and' hearty, and in the&#xD;
most independent circumstances. He did not leave his home&#xD;
for two weeks, and then-he returned to. Charleston, and com-&#xD;
inenced writing letters to the Herald. These letters made a&#xD;
sensation at the time. -They were all signed "Commissioner,"&#xD;
and dated Charleston, ,Augusta, Columbia, Camden, Green-&#xD;
ville, Sparta, Glen Springs, Unionville, Winsboro, Cosar's&#xD;
Head, Flat Rock, and other points of interest in the State, not&#xD;
excepting Fort Hill, near Pendleton, the residence and home&#xD;
of the great Calhoun. There Marion spent two months, for he&#xD;
was an especial favorite of the great statesman. These letters&#xD;
can all be found in old files of the Herald. There were six&#xD;
published in the London Herald, written by " Conmissioner/"&#xD;
who was Marion, Monck, and who wrote these letters as flyers.&#xD;
The series, if collected and bound in a volume, would have a&#xD;
great run, for it is now no secret, that in writing these, letters&#xD;
Marion had assistance from the highest source in the State.&#xD;
j Mr. Calhoun himself furnished most of the ideas,'(and some&#xD;
were brilliant,) for these Southern letters,&#xD;
.While a resident at Mr. Calhoun's mansion, Marion. Monok&#xD;

became acquainted with a lady and her daughter who were up&#xD;
on a visit to the great statesman's faily,-in fact were dis-&#xD;
tantly related. The young girl was not twelve years of age,&#xD;
and a regular wild one. She, would ride with ease the most-,&#xD;
skittish horse on Mr. Calhoun's plantation, and would drive&#xD;
into Pendleton and back again in a buggy, with perfect safety.&#xD;
When she rode about the place, or visited any of thb neigh-&#xD;
bors, she rarely troubled the negroes to open gates for her,&#xD;
but made her.horse leap the various fences.&#xD;
" That tom-boy will break her neck," exclaimed Mrs. Cal-&#xD;
houn, on one occasion, as "Cara" came full tilt with her horse&#xD;
over the fence of the door yard. Mr. Calhoun was also on the&#xD;
piazza of his residence, standing by the side of his wife, and&#xD;
was a witness to the feat.&#xD;
"Don't call her tom-boy. It is not a.proper title. I like to&#xD;
see it.. Cara by such exercises is developing her physical&#xD;
powers, and one day will be able to3 become such a wife and&#xD;
mother as God intended women to be. Tire is -'no weak,&#xD;
sickly effeminacy about her, engendered by being shut up in&#xD;
a parlor, without pure air or healthy exercise.. I like to see&#xD;
a girl educated in that manner. It is an education worth more&#xD;
to her and to society than it is even to 'be able to read and&#xD;
write, if she could not have both physical and mental educa-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
Marion listened with interest to these remarks about a little&#xD;
girl that he escorted to various places,,leading her by the&#xD;
hand. These remarks probably led him in after years, when&#xD;
Mr. Calhoun had descended to the tomb, to make this ci-devant'&#xD;
little girl " Cara " Mrs. Monck. But we are getting on too&#xD;
fast yith our story.&#xD;
It was late in October before Marion Monck had finished the&#xD;
tour of South Carolina. Then he returned to Monck's Cor-&#xD;
ners, and spent another happy month with his parents. His&#xD;
father was extremely anxious that he should give up New York&#xD;
and remain at home.&#xD;
" You have seen the world, my son. Why not now settle&#xD;
down and'live at home ? We are not rich, but we have every&#xD;
comfort that a reasonable young man can desire. Where else&#xD;
can y'u find more substantial happiness ?"-l&#xD;
It was all in vain. Marion's mind was made up, -and no in.&#xD;
ducement held out by his father could persuade him to give&#xD;
up for a moment his long dream' of ambition, which was to sue-&#xD;
coed as a inerchant -in New York.&#xD;
&#xD;
VIGOR,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
",I will 'make a spoon or spoil a horn in that city," was Ma-&#xD;
rion's quiet rejoinder, quoting a favorite axiom of'his father.&#xD;
"You say, Marion, that you desire to go into business in&#xD;
New York. Let mother and I make up what capital you need.&#xD;
By selling cattle and stock of various kinds, and adding to it&#xD;
some bank stock that we have put by, we could give you sonie&#xD;
seven or eight thousand dollars, and not miss it much if you&#xD;
were to lose it all," said his father.&#xD;
"God bless you, dear father. I would not touch your hard&#xD;
earnings if it was to be the means of making. me as rich as all&#xD;
the Ravenels and old Wade Namptons to boot. No-don't say&#xD;
a word about it. I shall not starve in New York, and I may&#xD;
succeed," said Marion.&#xD;
 ' And if you do succeed, my son, what does it all amount&#xD;
to ?  You can't eat any more-you can't drink any more-.--you&#xD;
can't sleep any more, if you succeed, as.you call it, and get to&#xD;
be worth millions, than you can up here at Monck's Corners&#xD;
in our own comfortable homestead, which will be all yours&#xD;
when we die. Besides, there is no such, hunting in New York&#xD;
city as here. There are no such deer-there are no such wild&#xD;
turkeys ; and you can catch more fish in the Santee Canal and&#xD;
Biggin Creek in half an hour than you can catch in' the New&#xD;
York waters in a week," exclaimed the honest 'old father...&#xD;
Marion laughed and replied, "True as gospel, my dear fa-&#xD;
ther ; and you might'have added, there are no such live oaks&#xD;
in any New York door-yard as there are about this house-no&#xD;
such magnificent forests, and all that. Still I must try my&#xD;
luck in the city for -a while longer. I should stagnate here-&#xD;
die from actual want of something to do."&#xD;
"A wilful man will have his way," replied the elder Monck,&#xD;
and left Marion, while he went to look after his horses.&#xD;
The mother,, who loved her son devotedly, was equally un-&#xD;
successful in her endeavors to persuade him to give up New&#xD;
York, and settle at Monck's Corners. When the time came for&#xD;
his departure, both parents accompanied him to Charleston,&#xD;
and did not return to Monck's Corners until Marion had sailed&#xD;
for New York.&#xD;
While in Charleston, Marion called ou his early friend M)rs.&#xD;
Ferguson. 'She was delighted to see him once more, and he&#xD;
expressed his gratitude for the success which her letter of in-&#xD;
troduction many years previous had brought to him. The&#xD;
good lady -said,&#xD;
" I have sold out everything, and am ready to go -to New&#xD;
York to live with Bessy. She has written for me.".&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7714-00000199"/>&#xD;
"So she told me before I left New York. In fact, I had no&#xD;
idea that I should find you here. Why not go on to New York&#xD;
with me ?" said Marion..&#xD;
" I certainly will do so if you will take charge of me," was&#xD;
the reply of the worthy landlady-I -&#xD;
it was so arranged, and Marion secured a passage for Mrs.&#xD;
Ferguson on board the ship Saluda. They had a pleasant pas'A&#xD;
sage to New York, and when the shipreached the dock Marion&#xD;
hired a carriage, and conveyed the lady to the residence of&#xD;
Mrs. Wilson, her niede. He remained only long enough to&#xD;
shake hands, and then went to the Herald office, where he&#xD;
found Mr. Bennett. He was cordially received.&#xD;
" Capital letters you sent me. I published every one of&#xD;
them, They were very interesting," observed the editor.&#xD;
"I am very glad that they pleased you. I should have sent&#xD;
you more, but I was detained several weeks at Mr. Calhoun's&#xD;
residence," added Marion.&#xD;
" I am not disappointed. What money have you, received&#xD;
while you were absent "?'' .  .      .&#xD;
" Just enough to pay my current expenses. I have not&#xD;
been very extravagant," replied Marion.&#xD;
Mr. Bennett took a slip of paper, wrote a few words upon&#xD;
it, and handed it to. Marion, observing, at the same time, "How&#xD;
would you like to go to Washington ?"&#xD;
"I don't know at present. I have to see a person, and then&#xD;
I will tell you," replied Marion.&#xD;
"Very well. Call upon. me when your mind is made up,"&#xD;
said Mr. Bennett, and Marion left him. to go with the slip of&#xD;
paper to the cashier. It was for three hundred and fifty dol-&#xD;

fun. In fact, I did not expect to receive a cent, and am rather&#xD;
surprised at 'the liberal'amount.- The fifty must answer my&#xD;

FEW persons could be found who appeared to enjoy life and&#xD;
his position with more satisfaction than the Count Adolph&#xD;
Falsechinski. Every thing that he had meddled with had&#xD;
turned out successfully from   the moment he met Marion&#xD;

"Then I shall not deny it, if that is the case.  I did write&#xD;
the letters," said Marion.&#xD;
"And extremely interesting they were. I am glad to meet&#xD;
with you," said the merchaut.&#xD;
When Marion took his leave he went up to his old Spanish&#xD;
boarding-house, and re-took his room.    His pretty   en-orita&#xD;
friends Inez and Isabella were delighted to see him, and he&#xD;
was glad to see them. He at once wrote a letter to his father,&#xD;
after the following fashion:&#xD;
"NEW YORK, Dec. 1,8-18-.&#xD;
'A M1 Dear Father-&#xD;
"I am safe bpck in the great city that you so honestly detest. I was&#xD;
agreeably surprised on my arrival to findthat my Southern letters have&#xD;
proved to be worth three undred and fifth dollars. The fifty dollars I&#xD;
shall spend-the three hundred dollars I d not need. When I was 1ast&#xD;
with' you, I noticed that you we're, very anxious to own the magnificent&#xD;
stallion -Santee," belonging to your friend Schopman. The price asked&#xD;
was three hundred dollars. The enclosed order will just pay for that&#xD;
horse, and I beg you will consider it a gift from your affectionate son.&#xD;
Give my love to mother and to aunt Mary, and give a pound of tobacco to&#xD;
Mann, Phillis, and Daddy Jemmy respectively. They will appreciate to.&#xD;
bacco more than a love message. Your affectionate sin,&#xD;
MARIo MONKK"&#xD;
When Marion had finished this document, he inclosed the&#xD;
draft in it, and then mailed it himself at the post-ofice. Then&#xD;
he went up town, where he met a friend whs told him that he&#xD;
had been earnestly sought after by the Count Falsechinski.&#xD;
So Marion left a card at the residence of Mr. Grisper, for the&#xD;
Count was not at home when he called. Then he went around&#xD;
town to places where he was known, and at a late hour returned&#xD;
to his boarding-house.&#xD;

acquaintances; he speculated in stock and doubled his mo-&#xD;
ney-.-in real estate, and it brought him a fortune. He mar-&#xD;
ried, and obtained beauty, dignity, rich relations, and a large&#xD;
amount of cash ; and even while these successes were being&#xD;
achieved by his own diligence and exertions, his patriotic bro-&#xD;
ther 'died, leaving him the head of an old noble family in Po-&#xD;
land ; and a slight fine restored-to him his title of Count, and&#xD;
the estates unincumbered.&#xD;
After his marriage with Miss Grasper, the Count travelled&#xD;
with his bride for several weeks. On their return to the city&#xD;
they made their residence at the granite palace of Mr. Grasper.&#xD;
The Count had won the heart of the old gentleman, who be.&#xD;
came more pleased with the match as he became better ac.&#xD;
quainted with the sterling qualities of his son-in-law. The&#xD;
Coutiteos became devotedly attached to her husband; he was&#xD;
kind and attentive, and his devotion did not end with the ho*&#xD;
neymoon-he commanded respect wherever 'he went, and every&#xD;
hour's intimacy taught the bride to respect more and more her&#xD;
lord and master.&#xD;
Over the inind of Francis Grasper, his brother-in-law, the&#xD;
Count *as not long in obtaining a complete mastery. The&#xD;
former admired theater as much as one man could possibly&#xD;
'adinire another, and was pleased to have him for -his' relative.&#xD;
He made his sister happy, and what more could be desired?&#xD;
"Frank, I wish you to go and dine with me to-day where we&#xD;
can be alone by ourselves," said the Count one morning, when&#xD;
all were assembled at breakfast.&#xD;
"Nothing would give ie more pleasure-; when and where&#xD;
shall it be ?"&#xD;
"At Delmonico's,.time three o'clock," and turning to the-&#xD;
old gentleman, lie added, "-The fact is, Mr. Grasper, I have a&#xD;
place- for Frank.whieb I think he will like, and after I have&#xD;
made sure of it by a private conversation with him, I will ex-&#xD;
plain the matter to you.  I detest seeing a fine young fellow&#xD;
like Frank, although he may come into a fortune some day,&#xD;
without any visible meis of exertion.  I should like to see&#xD;
him employed--useful, doing something."&#xD;
"Count, you have hit my ideas precisely. 'To tell you the&#xD;
truth, I would like to have Franks do something for himself--he&#xD;
is quite old enough to settle down. If you can arrange it, you&#xD;
will oblige me very much."&#xD;
" Then do not forget your own appointment, Frank ;-and&#xD;
now I must leave you."&#xD;
With this sudden closing, the Count passed into the street&#xD;

and wended his way down town, stopping at Centre street, in&#xD;
the hope of meeting Marion or of learning his whereabouts.&#xD;
Although he did not find Marion, he discovered a person whom&#xD;
he remembered very well, notwithstanding his features were&#xD;
altered. It was Walter Granville, smoking a cigar and drink.&#xD;
ing a glass of hot toddy. Somewhat fiercely he addressed (he&#xD;
Count.&#xD;
"Well, Count, you have got up a little higher in the world&#xD;
than when I first knew you. Then I believe you taught lan-&#xD;
guages .&#xD;
"1I have no reason to be ashamed of my profession, when I&#xD;
had the honor to teach a lady who is now I believe Mrs. Wal-&#xD;
ter Granville," and the"Count bowed.&#xD;
"Yes, you did teach my wife, and I am much obliged to~&#xD;
you.  A good many of our old friends have stepped out since&#xD;
I first met you."&#xD;
" Colonel Mac Neil is dead-Mr. Nordheim is dead-your&#xD;
uncle Thomas is dead. Yes, we all have to die. Have you&#xD;
seen your father?"&#xD;
"No, I have not; he doesnot trouble his head about me,&#xD;
and I see no reason why I should fret about him. They say&#xD;
you are rich, Count. Is it so 1" asked the young man.&#xD;
I am not poor, and I am not ashamed under my altered&#xD;
circumstances, to say I was once very poor. Can I be of any&#xD;
service to you, Mr. Walter ?"&#xD;
'Not a bit, not a particle--I can steer my own canoe: will&#xD;
you take a drink ."&#xD;
Excuse me, I rarely drink in the morning, and I must&#xD;
hurry down town; good morning, sir," and with these few&#xD;
words the Count took his departure.&#xD;
"That- is a proud, haughty cuss; he was once humble&#xD;
enough, but he has pluck and I like him. I wish my old gov-&#xD;
ernor would kick the bucket, and then I would hold up my&#xD;
head as high as any of them'," muttered the son to himself after&#xD;
the Count's departure. "Jemmy, give me another drink. I&#xD;
wonder what the devil keeps.Harry away so long. Sure he&#xD;
has not been here, eh ?"&#xD;
"I am certain he has not been here, and he will probably. be&#xD;
along soon. Who was your friend that just went out ?" asked&#xD;
the bar tender.&#xD;
"That is a real live Count-the Count Falsechinski--.aud he&#xD;
has got the brads, too," was the reply.&#xD;
I saw him give Colonel Mac Neil a hundred dollars one&#xD;
day.-.-it was just before the Colonel died," said Jemmy,&#xD;

"cThe deuce you did.-why, what claim had the Colonel on&#xD;
the Count ."&#xD;
"I do not know, but the fact is as I tell you. There is.your&#xD;
friend Robinson."&#xD;
At this moment Henry Robinson entered the store from the&#xD;
rear, and without a word took a chair and seated himself by&#xD;
Walter Granville.&#xD;
"What the old Nick makes you look so moody-any thing&#xD;
gone wrong,?" inquired Walter.&#xD;
onYes, every thinrseems td me wrong.   have just called&#xD;
ife. I am getting too much in her debt. It is a&#xD;
same, buti can't help it.  Rose, poor thing, is an awful&#xD;
expense, but Ih can'pthelp it. I was obliged to get funds&#xD;
from Mrs. Granille this morning."&#xD;
Well, that isall right.  Did she shell out freely, or hesi-&#xD;
tate ?". asked Walter.&#xD;
aNot In the least, and I do not like riding a free horse to&#xD;
death, when I have rich relativese  r of my own.  I told Mrs.&#xD;
Granville so this morning, and asked her advice., She gave&#xD;
me a plan to workupon,and curse me if I don't try it on. I&#xD;
am going to have an interview with my parents-...what do you&#xD;
hif Clara..-my wife, I mean-has suggested a plan, it is a&#xD;
good one. S   e is clever. What an infernal shame that such&#xD;
a woman should ever have been a  -.  Blame i, I cannot&#xD;
pronounce the word when I am speaking of myown wife. But&#xD;
Ole is honest now, and the'old devil we live with !-a'nt she- a&#xD;
sanctified old sinnerdon't mention it,! said Walter.&#xD;
shall try the plan, and if it succeeds you shall know all&#xD;
about it. If it does not, there is no hariii done. Answer- me&#xD;
oneuquestion. Do you think Rose would pass for a Spanish'&#xD;
girl ?&#xD;
"Blame me if I don't think she would. If she only spoke,&#xD;
Spanish you could not tell her from a genuine pretty senorita&#xD;
--black hair and eyes, and all that sort of thing."&#xD;
These two young men continued together for some hours,&#xD;
drinking and smoking, until Walter was" pretty tight."&#xD;
Harry, I shall not see youvery often after tis. I think&#xD;
you will get all right with' your parents-if so, the less you&#xD;
see of me the better, and the less Rose has to do with Clara&#xD;
the bete.In fact, old fellow, don't think hard of -me if I&#xD;
should soon be among the missing. This getting money fo&#xD;
a woman as I do, is not the thing for me. I shall cut it before&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
a great while, and then I am off to sea again. I like indepen-&#xD;
dence."&#xD;
"But.your wife-whatIwill she do ?"&#xD;
"She be blamed. She has always taken care of herself&#xD;
without me, and can do it ag n. Not a word about what I&#xD;
have said to you, to her,"obs rved Walter Granville.&#xD;
He parted with Robinson at the door of the grogshop, and&#xD;
went at once to his wife's apartment in Bond street. When&#xD;
he entered the room, he flung himself upon the sofa, saying,&#xD;
How are you, Clara? All alone, eh.? That is right."&#xD;
"Beast," was hissed through the lady's teeth, and 'then she&#xD;
continued, "Walter Granville, you are drunk again. In fact,&#xD;
it is nothing but drunk from morning until night. I will pat&#xD;
up with it no longer. Either stop it or quit," said Clara,&#xD;
firmly.&#xD;
"Quit-that's the 'word, is it ?" Walter raised himself upon&#xD;
the sofa. Then he sat up. 11Quit--is it to be?. You, infer-&#xD;
nal wicked prostitute. Your acts have inveigled me into a&#xD;
marriage, and now because I don't please you-because I try,&#xD;
to drown my degradation in drink, you wantto cry 'quit,' "-&#xD;
and as he said this he sprung at her, 'and closing? his hands&#xD;
about her neck, he choked her until he himself got scared, or&#xD;
when he remoVed his hands she sank down upon the sofa with-&#xD;
out sense or motion. He stepped to. the washstand, seized a&#xD;
jug of water, ,and threw the entire contents over her person,&#xD;
drenching? her completely." Now live or die, curse IyOU. I&#xD;
don't care which. I ought to kill you, and id the world o  a&#xD;
female d-evil. Would to God I had never seen- you, and I&#xD;
hope that to-night is the last that I shall spend within aathou-&#xD;
sand miles of you. You are getting around again, 'eh ?" ex-&#xD;
claimed Walter,*&#xD;
Clara opened her eyes and gazed at him. "Walter, I did&#xD;
not expect this from you. You hurt me cruelly,'t she ex-&#xD;
claimied.&#xD;
"Did I ? It will do you good---.teach you to keep a civil&#xD;
tonguehin your head, for it is a bit of a foretaste of what.I will&#xD;
do with you if ever- J. put my hands abodt you again- in real&#xD;

of parting. I am ready. What have you got to say. to it ?"&#xD;

mean to hurt yourfeelings. You knowIlove you, and have&#xD;

it's ,o use talking. If you have- got any spare change, give it&#xD;
to me, for I shall never ask you again. I am gomg to be in.&#xD;
dependent, if I ain't any thing else," continued Walter.&#xD;
It was in vain that Mrs. Granville remonstrated, begged, and&#xD;
even prayed Walter to remain.  hreaten him, she dare not&#xD;
do, after the experience she hakhad of his choking propensi-&#xD;
ties, She handed him her purse. .He took from it a few dol-&#xD;
lars, and handed the:rest back to her.&#xD;
"I want a rig and enough to carry me to Alexandria. Thera&#xD;
I am going to ship before the mast in a vessel bound round the&#xD;
Horn. That is between you and me. The fact is, you will&#xD;
hear' of my death in about a fortnight. Then you can play the&#xD;
gay widow, and no fear of my ever -turng up again. I will&#xD;
do you that justice, for ever I do come this way, it will be&#xD;
years hence, and under some assumed name. Keep up a stout&#xD;
heart. It's no use talking, Clara., It has got to be as I have&#xD;
said. You are tired of me. I am tired of you. That is hon-&#xD;
est. If I stay here, all your money won't keep me from  a&#xD;
drunkard's death. .It will force it on me. Now let us part&#xD;
friends," said Walter.&#xD;
Clara Norris was, for once in her life, affected. She knew&#xD;
the determined will of Walter Granville. She knew that she&#xD;
should see him no more-that he was going to sea on a long&#xD;
voyage. She burst into tears.&#xD;
"Oh, Walter, I cannot 'bear this. Do not go, or take me&#xD;
with you."&#xD;
" Nonsense. Now mark' my words. You will see my death&#xD;
in the papers before long. I want to be dead to all here. But&#xD;
'I tell you, there will not be a word of truth in it. I shall con-&#xD;
tinue to, live under some assumed name. Now good-bye. No&#xD;
nonsense." Saying this he kissed her, and was about to leave&#xD;
when he- seemed to remember something.     He then said,&#xD;
" Clara, if you have one tender spot for poor. Walter, and want&#xD;
to do me a kindness, lend a helping hand to Harry Robinson&#xD;
and Rose,"-and before she could reply he was out of- the&#xD;
room, down the stairs, and in the street.  What direction he&#xD;
took after leaving her, she never heard.&#xD;
More than a fortnight elapsed before she heard any more of&#xD;
him. Then a notice appeared in the morning paper, copied&#xD;
from a Philadelphia paper. It was as follows:&#xD;
"Walter Granville, a sailor on board the ship"Liberty, was lost over-&#xD;
-oArd on the 17th inst. The ship was dropping down thle river, and had&#xD;
anchored near Wilmington; The body was not recovered. The young&#xD;
sailor was a son of Mr. 1itt Granville, an emiment New York merchant."&#xD;
&#xD;
405&#xD;
&#xD;
Clara read and re-read the article. "lie has complied with&#xD;
a part of his promise. I suppose be went ashore at Wilming.&#xD;
ton), and then proceeded on to Alexandria by railroad," she&#xD;
thought aloud. But there was one iouse in which that'article&#xD;
was read where its effects were fearful. It reached No. 9&#xD;
State street, and was read by W. Pitt Granville. - He at once&#xD;
screamed with laughter. Then he called the rest of the fa.&#xD;
ily. Read the announcement of his son's death, making,'at the&#xD;
fame time, the most ludicrous grimaces. He said it was "fun-&#xD;
ny," "rare sport," "Walter was always fond of swimming."&#xD;
"better to be drowned than married."  He was not violent,&#xD;
but his mind had failed---or, at least, had temporarily given&#xD;
way.&#xD;
Colonel Benson came, and his son also. Mr. 4ranville was&#xD;
insane. There was no question about it. Physicians were&#xD;
called in. A person was appointed to take'temporary charge&#xD;
of him, until some permanent provision could b'e made to cure&#xD;
him if possible, or, at least, for his safety, should his madness&#xD;
assume a violent form.&#xD;
It was found that Mr. Granville was, at times, quite insane,&#xD;
and on one of his sane days he himself proposed that his friends&#xD;
should take him to the Bloomingdale Asylum, This was event-&#xD;
ually done.&#xD;

"I do not think I could have acted better for your own good&#xD;

"None whatever. 1 needed sleep, and.I obtained it the&#xD;
second night.  What a horrible thing this drink is! The&#xD;
medical genius has had to keep me under lock and key for two&#xD;
days.- Now tell me the circumstances under which you brought&#xD;
me hereoi Ihave a faint recollection of them, but am not clear,"&#xD;
replied O'Doemall.&#xD;
MarIon related the manner in which he met O'Doemall at&#xD;
Windust's cellar, his interview with Mr. James, and the re-&#xD;
ceipt of inoney ; and added, "You seemed perfectly cool. Yoa&#xD;
counted your money. Bye-the-by, I wish you to relieve me of&#xD;
further charge in the matter. I received six hundred dollars.&#xD;
I paid out hack hire ten, and three months' board here for you&#xD;
is sixty dollars more, and here is five hundred and thirty."&#xD;
Here he handed O'Doemall that sum, who counted it d-lib.&#xD;
erately, and observed,&#xD;
" All as right as a twist. It is not every man that would&#xD;
have acted in this manner, but I flatter myself, Mr. Monek,&#xD;
that I understand human character pretty well. That Mr.&#xD;
James would have robbed me of every cent and cleared out.&#xD;
By-the-by, where is that precious chap? .I wish you to answer&#xD;
me another question. Does anybody beside you and James&#xD;
know that I am here ?"&#xD;
"'Not a soul. James hasleft New York from some cause&#xD;
or another, and has gone over to Jersey. He left his address&#xD;
in case you wished to write him, and told me to tell- you that&#xD;
there was an English mad dog in New York, and that you had&#xD;
better keep from being bit by keeping out of the way," said&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
"Ah yes, I understand--the naad- dog'I suppose is liquor.&#xD;
It has bit me, and-I will keep out of the way. I rather like&#xD;
this place, and as my board is paid, I shall stay some weeks,&#xD;
or until my nerves get so strong that I can resist the temipta-&#xD;
tion to drink. What do you think of it?  It is rather discred-&#xD;
itable -to be in a mad house, but as no one of my city friends&#xD;
is aware that I am here, my character is safe, ehI " said Mr.&#xD;
O'Doemall, who had very powerful reasons for keeping shady.&#xD;
He deceived Marion completely, and the latter replied to hin,&#xD;
"The very best thing that you can do. Your business will&#xD;
not suffer, and your health will be really benefitted. I will do&#xD;
anything that I can for you in the city."&#xD;
"-Thank you. There is but one thing you can do. I wish&#xD;
u to call 'at' Blancard's Globe Hotel, and ascertain if Colonel&#xD;
Olairfoot is stopping there. If you' find that he is, or that he&#xD;
is in New 'York, I want you to ascertain-when- he leaves the&#xD;
&#xD;
*1&#xD;
&#xD;
city for England or Canada. I will do as much for you if I&#xD;
ever have the chance: In making inquiries about the Colonel,&#xD;
do not let any one know why you ask about him, and promise&#xD;
me that you will not cover me *ith eternal disgrace. by letting&#xD;
a soul knew th t I am in this mad-pen; or in existence. Will&#xD;
you promise me that much ?" asked O'Doemall.&#xD;
"With all my heart. Not a living soul shall be aware that&#xD;
you are alive, from my lips," replied the good-natured and un-&#xD;
suspicious Marion, who had no idea that placing O'Doemall in&#xD;
the Asylum had saved his life perhaps in more ways than one.&#xD;
It certainly was a secure and unsuspected refuge for the guilty&#xD;
man;, for Colonel Clairfoot had applied to the police for aid to&#xD;
discover O'Doemall, and the city had been searched from one&#xD;
end to the otheT.&#xD;
"What sort of a time have you had here? Do the keepers&#xD;
treat you well#?" asked clarion.&#xD;
"Like a prince ; and it is the funniest institution on Man-.&#xD;
hattan Island.' Of course I am not mad, but all these people&#xD;
are as mad as March hares, and yet are unconscious of it. Now&#xD;
we have all sorts of amusements-.a billiard table, a ninepin&#xD;
alley, and these mad chaps go and have a game. Fancy mv&#xD;
going to play ninepins with one of them  .1I made a match' to&#xD;
play a 'pony game.' It all went on very well for some time&#xD;
until I noticed that my opponent hesitated. Ie held in his&#xD;
hand a- good sized pony ball, and his eyes began to flash fire.&#xD;
I am. Jupiter, the Thunderer. Look out for my thunder,&#xD;
mortal! and he fixed his frenzied eyes upon me,, and lifted up&#xD;
the pony menacingly. You can bet high that the mortal&#xD;
sloped, and I ran out the back way as fast as my legs would&#xD;
carry me; but I was chased for some distance by Jupiter the&#xD;
Thunderer, who let fly a pony ball that whizzed with an inch&#xD;
of my head. If it had hit me, my brains would have been&#xD;
scattered. One of the alarm-keepers heard the noise, and&#xD;
Jupiter was seized, made' fast, and carried to a private apart-&#xD;
inent, where he might thunder as much as he, pleased, but&#xD;
where his thunder could not take the'shape of an iron-wood&#xD;
pony ball.P&#xD;
"I frequently walk about these beautiful grounds, and en-&#xD;

amiable follow. Finally he asked me to come and take a seat&#xD;
i. an arbor. I complied; and-had no sooner done so,. than he&#xD;
placed himself in the open doorway, and asked, 'Do you know&#xD;
me?' '$I suppose I do. You are doubtless one of the Mana.&#xD;
gers or Board of Directors.' He began to regard me rather&#xD;
more savagely than I liked, and replied, 'Wrong, sir. I am&#xD;
one of the Board of Directors of Heaven. I am the archangel&#xD;
Gabriel, and I will scorch you up like a feather with one Qf my&#xD;
wings, if you move;i' and with'this he began to use one of his&#xD;
flippers like a wing. I started to get out, but lie sprang upon&#xD;
me like a wild-cat, uttering, with a most fearful yell, 'Wretch&#xD;
--you murdered my brother angel!' I did get out--how, I&#xD;
don't exactly know; but. Left the archangel Gabriel with the&#xD;
claret flowing down his face pretty freely. I am somewhat&#xD;
given to pugilism, and* the poor maniac got a sample of it. But&#xD;
the'cases I have mentioned, Mr. Monck, are the quiet, ,gentle&#xD;
mad people. , 0,if you want to see the bad ones, go up where&#xD;
they chain them, and lock them up in cells. You can see.&#xD;
frightful cases enough there, if you. wish," continued Mr.&#xD;
O'Doemall.&#xD;
"I have seen'quite enough-A have no wish to make a more&#xD;
intimate acquaintance with any of the species of madness ; but&#xD;
can you go out when you please ?" asked Marion.&#xD;
"Certainly, if you are once pronounced sane. I could go&#xD;
out with you in five minutes, if you wished. How do you do,&#xD;
Mr. Foster ?"&#xD;
This was *addressed to a very gentlemanly looking man,&#xD;
nearly sixty years old, who approached them. O'Doemall in.-&#xD;
troduced Marion. The three conversed for some time, and&#xD;
thenM. Foster left them.&#xD;
"Good God I" said Marion, "I know him well. Why, he is&#xD;
a large merchant in South street. Is it possible that he is&#xD;
mad I  Why, he has a family-keeps a carriage, and has. a&#xD;
pew in Dr Spring's church !"&#xD;
"-The very same man, Mr. Monek; and if'he were to give&#xD;
you a check at this moment for twenty thousand dollars, it&#xD;
would be paid like winking. He is perfectly sane now," said&#xD;
Q'Doemal i.d&#xD;
" Then how in the arch Iiend's name does he happen to be&#xD;
here ?" asked Marion.&#xD;

him sleep when his blood is half alcohol. A soon as his&#xD;
family perceive what is coming on, they send him up here for&#xD;
a week or a fortnight, and give out in the city that he is sick.&#xD;
When he gets well, he remains up here several 4ays lnger&#xD;
than is necessary. ie is a little ashamed of it, but will soon&#xD;
geh'ever that. If he was to kick the .bucket up here, nothing&#xD;
would be said about it, and' his corpse would be sent down to&#xD;
his own house. At this moment there are thirty cases of de-&#xD;
lirium trenens in the Bloomingdale Asylum of men of wealth&#xD;
and standing in society-professors,merchants, lawyers, judges,&#xD;
and even drinking physicians, are cured temporarily here. It&#xD;
costs but sixty dollars, and a ride in a hack, Men frequently&#xD;
-come here in their own carriages, brought by their wives, sons&#xD;
or brothers," said O'Doemall.&#xD;
"I am somewhat surprised, I assure you. Can it be true ?'&#xD;
asked Marion.&#xD;
* "Don't trust to me. Get in with tlie officials of the esta-&#xD;
blishment, or watch with your own eyes, and you will meet&#xD;
men here that it would be an honorto know elsewhere. Poor&#xD;
devils that drink and get. delirious go to the Tombs, Alms..&#xD;
house and Hospital. The rich and respected in society,. who&#xD;
can pay sixty dollars and not feel it, come here to get cured&#xD;
and silence is the watchword for all' such cases."&#xD;
The two persons had now approached near the 'nain en-&#xD;
trance, and Marion asked Mr. O'Doemall if he had any c omnu&#xD;
mands in town. The reply was in the negative.&#xD;
"I do not want anybody living to know that I am here. I&#xD;
am not quite well, and I shall remain here until my general&#xD;
health is completely restored. Come and see me as often as&#xD;
you can, but do not be surprised if I- am not out of this for&#xD;
some weeks."&#xD;
While they were conversing, a carriage, or rather two Oar-&#xD;
riages, drove up to the main gate.&#xD;
"Some new customer for'the mad-house," observed O'Do-&#xD;
either spoke for some time, until Colonel -Benson and his&#xD;
son Middleton came out of the, first carriage.&#xD;
"As I live, there is Colonel Benson," said Marion, and&#xD;
added, "I will wait, and see who those people are."&#xD;

"The maa chap is Mr. Granville, as I am a sinner. There&#xD;
is no mistake about it," said O'Doemall.&#xD;
From the second carriage tame Mrs. Benson and Isabella&#xD;
Benson and Mrs. Wilson. The group entered the gate, and&#xD;
proceeded to the asylum.&#xD;
" A regular family party," said O'Doemall.&#xD;
'Walter Granville's death has done the work for his podr&#xD;
old father," added Marion.&#xD;
Is Walter Granville dead?  That is news to me.  When&#xD;
did he die ?" asked O'Doemall.&#xD;
" He was drowned from a ship in the Delaware river," re-&#xD;
plied Marion.I&#xD;
The two followed the procession up to the asylum, and after'&#xD;
Mr. Granville had been disposed of, and his friends had re-&#xD;
turned to New York, Marion made inquiries'of the superinten.&#xD;
dent. He ascertained that the physicians had pronounced the&#xD;
case of Mr. Granville to be a melancholy species of insanity,&#xD;
and that being uncertain what form it might take, it had been&#xD;
deemied advisable to place him under a mild restraint,, and&#xD;
where he could have the best of mad medical advice.&#xD;
. imay be as well here to state that Mr. Granville continued&#xD;
to reside at the asylunt foiamonths, and then for years.  He&#xD;
confided the  closing up of his affairs to his son-in-law 'and Col.&#xD;
Benson. ie signed his own papers in liquidation, and even&#xD;
the Checks with which he paid his quarterly dues of sixty dol-&#xD;
lars were signed by himself. When he wishes to leave the&#xD;
asylum, he does so, and not unfrequently, after a visit of two-&#xD;
or three days to the city, his own carriage conveys him back&#xD;
to the asylum. Hie is never violent, but for days is quietly in-&#xD;
sane. He is still wealthy, for his business was closed up, and&#xD;
his capital invested in real estate and stocks in his own name.&#xD;
His daughter treats him the same as in his palmiest days. His&#xD;
* grandchildren are objects of his deepest love, and he never&#xD;
.speaks of his son but in a sentence of two words-" Poor Wal.-&#xD;

To return to Mr. O'Doemall and Marion. They commented&#xD;
freely as they Lwalked about the grounds after Mr. Granville&#xD;
had been received upon his insanity. Marion was uitable to&#xD;
realize the fact. He was so many years with that merchant,&#xD;
and respected him so highly, it seemed impossible he could&#xD;
fall from his lofty position. He was abruptly startled from his&#xD;
reflection by the voice of O'Doemall,&#xD;
" That sweetheart of yours, Miss Isabel, is quite a little ugly&#xD;
old womaii. I suppose seeing her has touched a soft spot, eh ?"&#xD;

" Not at all. I ain pained to see the head of the family in-&#xD;
side of these walls, and I am sorry that his daughter should be&#xD;
a witness of her father's incarceration. 'But -he has shown&#xD;
that she has filial feeling in her heart by coming here with&#xD;
him, and I respect her the more for so doing," observed Ma-&#xD;
rion, quietly.&#xD;
"I have no wish to hurry you, but it is time for you to go.&#xD;
The hour of visitors is -passed," said O.'Doemall.&#xD;
Marion bade him good-bye, left the asylum, and returned to&#xD;
town.&#xD;
It was some days before he could execute the commission of&#xD;
Mr. O'Doemall in reference to Colonel Clairfoot. When he&#xD;
returned to the asylum, he carried with him a newspaper in&#xD;
which, among.the list of passengers by a packet ship that had&#xD;
sailed for Liverpool, were found the names of the Colonel and&#xD;
Lady Clairfoot. When O'Doemall read this, he asked Marion&#xD;
if he came out in a carriage. The reply was in the affirmative.&#xD;
"Then I will return to the city with you. I am quite well."&#xD;
Marion had no objection to ofer, and 'he two came to the&#xD;
city in the same carriage. O'Doemall ordered the coachmgn&#xD;
to drop him at the,"Waverly," a hotel on the corner of Broad-&#xD;
way and Exchange street.&#xD;
With Mr, O'Doemall oar story will soon finish. New York&#xD;
got too hot for him. He had committed acts that, fairly inves-&#xD;
tigated, would have sent him to the State Pson, He had es-&#xD;
caped the immediate danger from his wrongs to Lady Clair-&#xD;
foot, but how soon an avenger might return and hold-hn to a&#xD;
stern account, was not to be calculated upon. With such dan-&#xD;
gers staring him in the face, he made up his mind to leave.&#xD;
New York for a time, if not forever. He called upon the re-&#xD;
spectable firm with whom he had deposited ten thousand -dol-&#xD;
lars, being a portion of the money he had robbed from  Lady&#xD;
Clairfogt. He requested the firm to obtain for hiun ten certifi-&#xD;
cates of deposit in the Bank of New York, payable to his order,&#xD;
for one thousand dollars each, and he called and left his 8igna-&#xD;
ture at the bank and received the ten certificates. Armed with&#xD;
this sum and the ready cash he had about him, he left New&#xD;
York without a word to.'a living man or woman as to his des-&#xD;
tination.&#xD;

HenR RonINsoNq, did not rest long after her con versatjon&#xD;
with Walter Granvillo before -he put the plan he had proposed&#xD;
into operation. He called upon his .parents. They were&#xD;
delighted to once more behold their truant son. The mother&#xD;
gave way at once, and clasped'him in her arms. All was for.&#xD;
gotten and forgiven. The father hesitated, but as he looked&#xD;
at his son, more manly than ever, and bronzed by exposure&#xD;
and hardsiiipp, he too forgave, and all was well.&#xD;
"Now, Harry, will youngive up all your follies, stay at home,&#xD;
and be a good boy i"&#xD;
Father, I will; but I am no hypocrite. Mother, join with&#xD;
me in askingforgiveness for one act more. I have concealed&#xD;
it, but I will do so no longer. . In my travels in South Amer.&#xD;
ica at one of the ports of Peru I met with a lovely girl. She&#xD;
loved me. She was an orphan. She abandoned 'home; and&#xD;
came with me to America. I'have married her. I could not&#xD;
do less. Will you forgive me ?  Say but this. Receive-my&#xD;
Rosa, and I will do all that you wish me to do. She is at a&#xD;
hotel waiting for your decision. Forgive mne' this act, for it&#xD;
brings you a lovely' daughter, as well as a repentant son."&#xD;
Long and painful was the suspense. Then Mr. Robinson&#xD;
inquired if she was ofgood family ?&#xD;
"The best ; but all her relations are dead. She has now no&#xD;
one but her husband to love, and-"if you forgive me, then she&#xD;
will have two good-parents to love and respect, as I do," said&#xD;
Harry, and he' knelt to his parents and bowed his head almost&#xD;
to 'the,,carpet.&#xD;
"does Ihe speak EnglIsh askedkd the father.&#xD;
:She does. .I have taught it to her, and made her pledge&#xD;
her 'soleumi word that she will not speak a word of'Spaniah'tb&#xD;
&#xD;
two years.. This will make your son forget that she is a Span.&#xD;
ish girh"&#xD;
"4Harry, we forgive you. Go at onoe and bring your'wife&#xD;
here. We will receive her with open arus.-Mother, .you&#xD;
agree to this, eh ?"&#xD;
Of course the mother agreed to it, and Harry hurried off'for&#xD;
his wife. When he reached her and informed her of all that&#xD;
had occurred. She shrank from    the task. "Oh, if they&#xD;
should find me out. L cannot speak Spanish," pleaded Rose.&#xD;
"I have told them that you have prornised not to do so for&#xD;
two years, so that you will have to keep from Spanish for that&#xD;
length of time," laughingly observed Harry.&#xD;
At last poor Rose was equipped properly for the ep edition.&#xD;
Her baggage was packed, and she entered the cartrige that&#xD;
was to convey her to the house of her husband's parents with a&#xD;
shrinking, palpitating heart. She was-beautiful, and Harry,&#xD;
as he clasped her to his heart, whispered words of encourage-&#xD;
ment and endearment at the same moment.&#xD;
Again he entered his father's doors ; and leaning on his arm&#xD;
was the pretty but confused- trembler. 'They entered the par.&#xD;
' or, and the fair girl was kissed and 'embraCed by both parents.&#xD;
It was a happy, day. That night, before. the family retired,&#xD;
Henry was called into a room by his father,: " You have sown,&#xD;
your wild oats, I hope, Harry. You have married a charming&#xD;
wife, and, you dog, if you-don't make her.happy, I. will never&#xD;
forgive you. You must go into business. I know a large&#xD;
broker who needs a partner and capital. I 'will furnish ye as&#xD;
his partner, and the necessary capital. Do you agree to it,&#xD;
"I agree, dear father, to any thing you propose. I can only&#xD;
regret that I ever disobeyed you in. anything " said Henry,&#xD;
with real feeling.&#xD;
"Let all that pass. Your wife is a lady if she is Spanish.&#xD;
I can see that shelias got the old Hidalgo blood in her veins;&#xD;
make her happy, you dog," said.the father,&#xD;
The happy husband was once more upon, his feet.  His fia&#xD;

knew it but Clara Norris and Mrs. Woodruff.   The latter&#xD;
knew very little about Rose or her husband-and though she&#xD;
once met the beautiful and fashionable Mrs. Robinson, she&#xD;
never dreamed that she had known her as Clara's friend Rose&#xD;
The change in her position in life never leaked out,  d if&#xD;
had, it could never have been proved. As years rolled on&#xD;
Robinson felt more at ease, and when his father died, leaving&#xD;
him a splendid fortune, he feared no longer.&#xD;
This ends his connection or that of Rose with our story. We&#xD;
must now return-to Clara Granville. Her advice had led to&#xD;
this happy result.-&#xD;
The melancholy intelligence that Walter Granville bad been&#xD;
drowned was no sooner communicated to his wife Clara Norris&#xD;
than she prepared to make the most of it.&#xD;
Properly handled, it would add to her respectability in one&#xD;
quarter, and that was at her home in Sussex County, New Jer-&#xD;
sey. She caused his death to be noticed in all the Jersey&#xD;
newspapers, as she had on the occasion of her marriage had a&#xD;
notice to that effect widely circulated.  The widow Clara&#xD;
Granville had a large quantity of the most suitable mourning&#xD;
dresses made, and in that regard her conduct was unexceptionf&#xD;
able. When/1the dresses were finished, she topk her departure&#xD;
from New York for Sussex County.&#xD;
She did not for one instant believe that Walter was dead.&#xD;
She knew better, but it suited her plans and purposes to act&#xD;
as if he were.&#xD;
This woman was still gloriously beautiful. She had not lost&#xD;
one charm.  Age seemed in her case to improve all that she&#xD;
originally possessed. She had taken the greatest care bf her&#xD;
person and her health : she dressed with elegance, and aimed&#xD;
at the simplicity and innocenceof a girl of sixteen.&#xD;
It has been mentioned to her credit, that one of her first&#xD;
acts, so soon as she had the means, was to elevate and place in&#xD;
an independent position, her parents.  This she had accom-&#xD;
plished. She had purchased a large and valuable farm, and&#xD;
stocked it well with cattle and agricultural implements.  Her&#xD;
father had proved an excellent farmer, and in nine years he&#xD;
had almost doubled its value.&#xD;
Clara had a brother and sister named Janies and 4ugusta.&#xD;
These children when she left home were respectively six and&#xD;
eight years old4L The boy James was the eldest.  Clara her-&#xD;
self was but fifteenwhen Mr. Nordheim removed her from her&#xD;
home; she was twenty-five when she Cturned thither a widow&#xD;
-but oh, to what a different home ! And the new home Was&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
of her own creating. She had sent both brother and sister&#xD;
away from 'home--the one to a Female Academy at Newark,&#xD;
and the other was now a student in Princeton College.- James&#xD;
was a handsome, intelligent young fellow, and Augusta was a&#xD;
full grown girl of sixteen, and as handsome as Clara was at&#xD;
that age, and they strongly resembled each other.&#xD;
The home to which Clara resorted when she became a widow&#xD;
we will attempt to describe. It was a large mansion, with&#xD;
plenty of out-buildings, many of them erected by Clara's or-&#xD;
ders. In front of the residence was a level lawn,.consisting of&#xD;
about twelve acres,.-and at the edge of this lawn was a fresh&#xD;
water lake of fifty acres, filled with fish of every kind. _ There&#xD;
was a bridge at the outlet of this lake, and crossing this bridge&#xD;
you drove for some distance on the main road, passing through&#xD;
fields of corn, grain, clover, and pastare grounds, the latter&#xD;
filled with cows of the best stock. You.descended 4 hill? -and&#xD;
then came to- another valley. At the side of the main road at&#xD;
the foot of the hill was a gate which opened into a side private&#xD;
road. . This led to the mansion, which was located about a&#xD;
quarter of a mile from the nfain road. As you drove to the&#xD;
house by this private road, you passed barns, and carried,&#xD;
tool, chicken, and. cow houses, and then came to two artificial&#xD;
fish ponds. A little farther on was a large spring, ten feet&#xD;
deep, surrounded by willows whose roots helped to strengthen&#xD;
the dam of the spring, over which poured the pure cold water,&#xD;
making a fall of several feet.  This water glisten  in the&#xD;
sun's rays, was a sight worth seeing. It formed a little brook&#xD;
which meandered through the meadow we have described, and&#xD;
emptied into the lake.&#xD;
To the north of the, dwelling 'were large ore.hardsand in all&#xD;
directions were fruit trees of every description. A hundred&#xD;
white ducks were swimming on the lake, and as many geese&#xD;
sporting in the brook. The garden was well laidout and filled&#xD;
with rare flowers. The poultry was of choice breeds, and fbad&#xD;
been'selected by Clara in New York. She had also made her&#xD;
purchases of wagons, bridles, harnesses and saddles, and sent&#xD;
them up. In the stahlea or in the fields were several valuable&#xD;
horses. Nothing was wanting-..-and when the widow reached&#xD;
her home and looked abroad over the beautiful scene. from, the&#xD;
piazza, and felt that she had created allthis, she said to her.&#xD;
self, "Well, well, -if I have been what the world calls bad, I&#xD;
have not lived in vain-J have made others happy." Then she&#xD;
tripped down to the large dairy houses, which, was built of&#xD;
. tone, and stood upon one corner of tlie spring, and drank&#xD;

buttprmilk, while she looked at the revolving'water wheel&#xD;
which was turned by the water from the spring, and churned&#xD;
all the butter made in that dairy.&#xD;
She was listening to the musie of the falling water when her&#xD;
lovely sister came down the road with a pail of milk. As she&#xD;
left the dairy, Augusta came and stood by her sister upon the&#xD;
large flat stone by the brook.&#xD;
" Dear, darling Clara. how beautiful you look.  But what&#xD;
makes you cry-do you miss brother    Oh, he will be here&#xD;
in a few days, and then we Will all' be so happy. How I should&#xD;
have liked to have seen my brother-in-law Mr. Granville. But&#xD;
he is dead.---and' I, a foolish girl, ask you why you weep. Come,&#xD;
dearest, the spray from the water will wet you through ; come&#xD;
and take a stroll down to the lake, and I will uqfasten the boat&#xD;
ad row you out. I can row the boat as well as brother."&#xD;
Clara threw her arms around the waist of the fair speaker,&#xD;
and accompanied her to the lake.  There was on it a beautiful&#xD;
boat, which Clara had sent up the year previous; she entered&#xD;
it, and her sister rowed her into the middle of the lake.  Not&#xD;
a wavelet disturbed that mirror of glassy water, so calm and&#xD;
still. Not a sound was heard except the chirping of some&#xD;
bird, or the lowitg of some cow.&#xD;
The sun had just set. Clara-'at motionless in the boat, and&#xD;
at. last she spoke.&#xD;
" Dear sister, here ought to be happiness, as there is peace.&#xD;
Oh, I will never leave this plae again. I have been in the&#xD;
world-seen its hypocrisy, frivolity cand heartlessness.  Here&#xD;
is home, and true, fond, loving hearts No, I will never leave&#xD;
you more. Now, darling, row the boat ashore, and we will go&#xD;
up to the house. The dew is falling fast," and I am  not yet&#xD;
used to it."&#xD;
The fair young sister complied, and they landed, and walked&#xD;
linked in each other's embrace up to the house.  There the&#xD;
evening meal was ready, and Clara partook of it, with a'silent&#xD;
happiness she had never known before.&#xD;
Few fair girls who have been forced into the life that Clara&#xD;
Granville-had led for ten years, evet retired from it so success-&#xD;
ful. She was purchased-willingly sold herself to better the&#xD;
condition of her parent. She' succeeded. There was no phase&#xD;
of the life she adopted that she did nhot experience. She was&#xD;
'the kept mistress. She had her costly' appointments in the&#xD;
highest class of Assignation , and she lived respectively in&#xD;
brothels No. 1, Ne. 2; ad No. 8, where 'she was accessible at&#xD;
the regidar prices of those establishments. From one of these&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
she emerged to entrap a young man of good family into mar-&#xD;
riage, FroM that hour she became virtuous, and when he left&#xD;
her to roam upon the ocean, 'and had 'his' death announced in&#xD;
the public prints, she retired to her home in the country-to&#xD;
the bosom of her family, to the respect of her parents, ,and the&#xD;
love of sister and brother. She owned a beautiful house. She&#xD;
owned property 'in New York that was rapidly rising in value,&#xD;
She 'had money in'stocks, and she had cash in bank.  Her&#xD;
beauty was unimpaired.  She had acquired accomplishments&#xD;
by hard labor. She 'could play upon the guitar arid the piano,&#xD;
spoke several modern languages, and an ordinary education" in&#xD;
other respects.  She had read every thing.  When she left&#xD;
home she was ignorant of all education. She had educated&#xD;
herself, her brother and her sister. She had redeemedafatlher&#xD;
and a mother who both drank.&#xD;
There is a moral in such a tale as this. We may condemn'&#xD;
the means she used to accomplish such great results, in her&#xD;
limited circle, but we cannot withhold praise from them.&#xD;
Contrast her position with the thousands who sink every year&#xD;
into the gutter and the grave in the great city of New York.&#xD;
Many enter upon the life of a harlot under as favorable aus-&#xD;
pices as Clara Norris did. They -are kept by men of wealth,&#xD;
but the foolish, unthinking girl spends what she could save&#xD;
with a lavish hand, and when the lover or keeper becomes cold&#xD;
she has no resource but to take a step down. Again she is the&#xD;
idolized, petted, caressed, and money-making girl in the most&#xD;
aristocratic house of ill-fame. But prudence deserts her here.&#xD;
Money is flung into her lap by handfuls, and she tosses .it out&#xD;

Clara Norris owed- her salvation and. success to one fact. She&#xD;
went"into a life of infamy armed with a holy love for her pa-&#xD;
rents and her brother and sister. She earned and she saved.&#xD;
It was for them, and as money accumulated she became more&#xD;
and more anxious. She thought and paid part-she had.a mo-&#xD;
tive to pay the rest until she owned property that paid an in-&#xD;
come of itself. . Her sin was great, but it was redeeming. She&#xD;
did good to others, and first to her own household.&#xD;
When she returned to reside in her parents' home did the&#xD;
finger of scorn point at her from  any quarterT  No. She&#xD;
would have shot that man with looks alone that had dared to&#xD;
approach her in her own home with infamous thoughts or pro-&#xD;
posals. Neither was she a hypocrite. To her young and beau-&#xD;
tiful sister she unfolded the-secrets of her past life, her mno-&#xD;
tives, and by her conversation, impressed her with the awful&#xD;
sanctity of virtue, and the happiness of a fair girl, whose posi-&#xD;
tion was such, that she need not- deviate from  its paths, and&#xD;
after the conversation, that younger sister, in her robe of pur.&#xD;

wild forests with a character as stern and proud as if contam-&#xD;
iV'ation had never approached the sister, she loved, who- had&#xD;
.sacrificed all she had done for the good of the drunken parents&#xD;
and the poverty struck, unrespected children. Augusta, as she&#xD;
listened to her sister's exposure, loved her dearer than ever.&#xD;
So when James caine home, a glorious educated boy, she was&#xD;
his companion, talked freely with him, instructed him against&#xD;
the wiles of the sex, told him of the power of money, what it,&#xD;
'had done for all of them, and how it was powerful enough to&#xD;
beat down the darts, of scorn from the most, respected and re-&#xD;
speetable in society. Mrs. Granville, at her home, was the&#xD;
perfect lady. She devoted herself to making her sister as ae-&#xD;
complished as herself. She sought no society ; and she treated&#xD;
with kindness all those who approached her home with-feelings&#xD;
of respect.&#xD;
Her brother was armed against the false opinion of the&#xD;
world. The sister installed into-his mind the highest ambi-&#xD;

could be far happier than in any other sphere of life.&#xD;

CHAPTER LXVI.&#xD;
The Count Falsechinski dines at belmonico's with his Brother-in-law-Pro-&#xD;

3nnets opinion of the London Times and Jourialism generally.&#xD;
DELMONICO's establishment was at theeorner of Beaver and&#xD;
William street, and the Count Falsechinski'met his brother-in-&#xD;
law Francis Grasper at the appointed hour, as agreed upon at&#xD;
breakfast. The Count was there in advance of young Grasper,&#xD;
and lie occupied his time until the latter arrived in the coffee-&#xD;
room of that famed and still famous establishment. A dinner&#xD;
had been ordered in a private room. When Francis arrived,&#xD;
they both repaired to the room, and soup was soon placed -&#xD;
fore them.&#xD;
"Brother of mine, I don't feel much like dining, a'nd I did&#xD;
not fix upon a dinner as a means of very great enjoyment, but&#xD;
rather as a means of securing your time and attention, while I&#xD;
open to yott a plan that I think you will be pleased with," ob-&#xD;
served the Count.&#xD;
"I am quite sure, Count, that I shall be pleased with any&#xD;
project you -should suggest for my advantage. I know you&#xD;
have my good at heart, and I know you would propose nothing&#xD;
that would not be pleasant to me," said young,-Grasper.&#xD;
" Do not be too sure of that, my amiable brother, but-listen&#xD;
to me. The American people must have something to -do,.if&#xD;
they would be respected. You may be as rich as- Cresus, or&#xD;
your father--it won't answer for,-respectable purposes, unless&#xD;
-youdo something in this country where people al work.&#xD;
People ask.'Who is that young man' They also ask,- 'What&#xD;
does he do?' -To the first question, the reply, ' He is the son&#xD;
of the President of the United States, or of John Smith, is&#xD;
- alike unsatisfactory, unless the second is -properly angered&#xD;

He must do something. What do you say to that, Francis.&#xD;
Am I not correct ?' asked the Count.&#xD;
"You are not only correct, but I have already experienced&#xD;
its truth. Many a time have I been asked,-'What business are&#xD;
you inI' and when I have replied- ,I am in no business,' the&#xD;
question has been repeated in a different form .'Clerking it&#xD;
yet' and when I have said, 'No, I am not a elerk,' there has&#xD;
been a pause, as though I had insinuated.that I lived by petty&#xD;
larceny, or something that was criminal. You are right,&#xD;
Count, I need something to do. What is it you have to pro.&#xD;
pose ?" asked young Grasper.&#xD;
" My dear Franeis are you willing to become  a lawyer ?"&#xD;
asked the Count.&#xD;
" No," replied Francis-&#xD;
"A doctor V' asked the Count&#xD;
"No, no," replied Francis.&#xD;
"A parson ?" asked the Count.&#xD;
"No, no, no. Worse and worse," replied Francis.&#xD;
Then, my dear fellow, there is only one decent employ-&#xD;
ment left. Will you consent to be a merchant ..&#xD;
What sort of a merchant-a dry goods,, shoe I store, Bilks,&#xD;

"No.--none of thesa.- They are mere shopkeepers, not mer-&#xD;

to export and import eargoes. To sell cargoes, and foreign or&#xD;

of conducting just such a business as I have described, said&#xD;
the Coumt.&#xD;
"What is his name ~? DolI know him ?" asked Gasper, Jr.&#xD;
"Hs anameha1 Marion Monok. XHe was for many para in the&#xD;

Ral, ad te.&#xD;
capital, and there will be no trouble in getting your father to&#xD;
give you a still larger capital," observed the Count.&#xD;
Young Grasper reflected a few moments, and then replied,&#xD;
Iam perfectly willing to go into .such a partnership for&#xD;
the purpose of doing the commercial business you have de-&#xD;
scribed, but I am not at all acquainted with it. Would MI&#xD;
Monek be content with such a commercial ignoramus -as I&#xD;
should prove to be for a partner," asked Francis Grasper.&#xD;
I have no doubt of it. He would of course understand&#xD;
that you could not regulate business, or conduct it as he could&#xD;
now do. But you would learn in tiune to do that. .1 know&#xD;
yot possess perseverance, and have nothing to interfere with a&#xD;
devotion to your new business. .1 thought I would have a free&#xD;
and frank conversation with you before I said anything definite&#xD;
to my young friend Monck, or to your father. Now if you will&#xD;
say that you would like to try the experiment, I will go t6&#xD;
work and complete all the necessary arrangements," -said the&#xD;
4ount.&#xD;
"Then I say at once, go ahead. I am willing to place mY-&#xD;
self in your hands, and am really quite anxious to see my part-&#xD;
ncr thht is to be," said FrancisaGrasper.&#xD;
ALet us finish our dinner, then, and go and:find Mr. Monek.&#xD;
He has been absent in the South for some time, or I should&#xD;
have proposed this matter to you long ago. He has been back&#xD;
a few weeks. I have seen him but two or three times since,"&#xD;
observed the Count.&#xD;
The brothers-in-law finished their dinner at Delmonico's, and&#xD;
then went to look after Marion Monk. They went to his&#xD;
boardinghouse and to several of his"haunts, but did not suc-&#xD;

my interest at heart. I have received a proposal to leave the&#xD;
city and to write letters to a leading newspaper this winter ;&#xD;
so if y  have not some thing for me to do, I shall accept it."&#xD;
Marionhesitated as he made this communication, but the&#xD;
Count relieved his mind at once.&#xD;
Well, Marion, hear what I have-to say, and then- decide.&#xD;
I owe you a debt' of gratitude that money cannot repay. I&#xD;
know that yo are ambitious to get into -mercantile business.&#xD;
I have had a plan for this a long time, but I was unable to&#xD;
carry it out until last spring, and then you were 'gone South&#xD;
before I knew it. I would furnish you with money freely, but&#xD;
I know also that you accept it reluctantly, and I doubt whether&#xD;
you would have done that had younot supposed I was paying&#xD;
to keep you along for purposes of my own. So I was. Now&#xD;
let ine explain my design. I have a brother-in law, a fine&#xD;
young fellow-his name is Francis Grasper. Did you ever&#xD;
see him," said- the Count.&#xD;
"Very frequently. I know him by sight, although I have'&#xD;
no particular acquaintance with him," replied Marion.&#xD;
.1 wish, to put this young man in business with you. Hie&#xD;
is intelligent, but inexperienced. What do you, say to it ?"&#xD;
asked the Count.&#xD;
"-owcan I go into business? I have no capital-and he&#xD;
would notgo into prknership with a young, man pennies&#xD;

"I1am not so sure of that, my young friend, but be that 4s it&#xD;
may be,-ILamlnotgoingto-leta you go into business without&#xD;
Capital. How m'ieh capital would it require to do a stife and'&#xD;

the Count.&#xD;
" I have sir, because it is a subject I have thought deeply&#xD;
about. If I was to go into business, and had thirty thousand&#xD;
dollars, w'e could do a smashing business," replied Marion.&#xD;
" Iope you wall not do a smashing busiess-that would&#xD;
be bade, .IBat seriously.' You shall have .thirty thousand dol-&#xD;
I will-give you .ten, thousand dollars, and this sum, with&#xD;
your superior business abilities, shall be deemed equal to&#xD;
twenty thousand dollars, -which Frank shall put in'  the concern,&#xD;
or rather his father shall pit in for him. - Now, sir, consider&#xD;
this matter as arranged. Does it meet 'your views?" asked&#xD;
thes Coute&#xD;
"Ican hardly speak, Count---I do not know what to say.&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
will cheerfully enter into t prtne ip so much to my benefit&#xD;
and I will do the best I can. My whole soul .shall be in the&#xD;
workk" observed Marion Ionk; very earnestly.&#xD;
"1My dear boy, I do not doubt it for a moment. You will&#xD;
succeed, I am sure'; but if you do not, it will not be a great&#xD;
loss to any one but yourself. I can afford to lose ten times ten&#xD;
thousand dollars, and not feel it;. and even if you do not su.&#xD;
ceed, old Mr. Grasper would pay willingly that sum to see his&#xD;
son in business with a good partner. Is it a bargain ?" asked&#xD;
the Count.&#xD;
"Decidedly, so far as I am concerned," said Marion.&#xD;
"Then you. must go up with me to Mr. Grasper's. Francis&#xD;
has been hunting with me for you for several hours, and went&#xD;
howe expecting you would come up as soon as I found you."&#xD;
B -ut, niy dear Count, I am not exactly fit for a visit," said&#xD;
Marion.&#xD;
   h" Bak ! Come with me and make no apYlogies. You will&#xD;
be welcome. We    o to talk business, and not to a-Areas ball..&#xD;
Come along."&#xD;
Thus urged by the Count, Marion made no further refusal,&#xD;
but walked up to the grand palace of the Count's father-in-law.&#xD;
"Is Mr. Francis Grasper in ?"was his first inquiry, after&#xD;
they reached the house.&#xD;
he is, sir," replied the servant; and followed by Marion,&#xD;
the Count passed into the, parlor, where the- object of their,&#xD;
search was seated by one of 'the windows. He received Ma&#xD;
nion in the most cordial manner.&#xD;
aI will leave you two young gentlemen to get acquainted.&#xD;
Francis, I have agreed -to giveM1arion -Mbnek ten thousand dot.&#xD;

and so your worthy father must make it upby'giving304,1tic1&#xD;
that amount. I will go and see him,. Make Mrion remain to&#xD;
tea. I wish to introduce him to the senior Mr. Grasper."&#xD;
With these words the Count passed-out- of the apartment to-&#xD;
an office,twhere he found his fatheria-lawr. To him the Count&#xD;
explained his plans. They were at once cordially e.-  aeed&#xD;
by the 'Old financier.- At the .tea-table,l Marion, Monok wasAi.&#xD;
troduced to the old gentleman, and to the rest of the family&#xD;
All were pleased, and ere he left, he had made an appointment&#xD;

be a partner of a "firm" oth thirty thousand dollars. " But&#xD;
I must not forget old friends while I am making new ones, and&#xD;
I will call upon Mr. Bennett on my way down and decline his&#xD;
kind offer."- With this intention he stopped at the "Astor."&#xD;
The editor of the Herald had recently married, and with his&#xD;
young bride was stopping at the Astor House. Marion Monek&#xD;
called to pay his respects and express his good wishes for 'the&#xD;
happiness of the new-married pair, and to decline the offers f&#xD;
going to Washington. He was introduced to Mrs. Bennett,&#xD;
and enjoyed a pleasant chat with the fatir dame.- Other visitors&#xD;
entered and occupied the attention of the lady, and Marion had&#xD;
Mr. Bennett to himself. He thanked the editor for his kind-&#xD;
ness, and for his fair offers for the future, but added :-" I have&#xD;
been so long an apprenticd to commerce that I have no ambition&#xD;
to suceeed'as a writer.- I have had an offer to go into partner-&#xD;
ship under very favorable auspices. My partner has capital&#xD;
and connexions, and, is a very amiable young man.-&#xD;
" I certainly wish you success; but I have my fears. I&#xD;
think that there is a great uncertainty about a merchant's suc-&#xD;
cess, and the day may come when you will regret not having&#xD;
%iade up your mind to connect yourself permanently with the&#xD;
business of/journalism," said Ar. Bennett.,&#xD;
"It may be so; but the position of a mechTant is 'much more&#xD;
creditable than even that of a newspaper tvriter," was Marion's&#xD;
reply.I&#xD;
" Simply because the position and power of the pen is not&#xD;
yet properly appreciated. What is his power in the world&#xD;
who can merely count that two and two are four, and that twice&#xD;
fonr ,are eight, and goes on to make or lose money on that&#xD;
basis--who knows how to eat, drink and sleep, and carry on a&#xD;
routine busineO---when placed. in comparison with the man&#xD;
who writes articles thatare read and will tell upon the winds&#xD;
of thousands ?-of a man who can make public opinion, or who&#xD;
can direct it, where it does exist, into healthful 'channels ?&#xD;
Such a m an in reality should hold a far -higher position than&#xD;
the -so-called merchant -orsu6cessful shop-keeper. Look at the&#xD;
Circulation of the Terald.. It issues ovei- ten thousand copies,&#xD;
and is read by at leastone hundred. thousand persons. Yet it&#xD;
has only comnienced its existence. I will increase its. cirou-&#xD;
%lation to ten times what it now is, before. matny years are&#xD;
'passed; andsit 'will command an influence upon this continent&#xD;
equal, if not superior to what the London Times now does in&#xD;
ERurope. Few people understand the true theory of journal-&#xD;
isa. £Ia'w but a pupil in it. When I started the. Herald I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
420&#xD;
&#xD;
thought I had no more to learn Every day convinces me&#xD;
that I do not even now know anything. Not a day passes but&#xD;
I acquire some new knowledge of my profession, and I suppose&#xD;
I shall continue to learn as long as I live."&#xD;
Marion made no reply for some time to a prophecy uttered&#xD;
by the editor, for be did not then appreciate its force. He&#xD;
asked a question: " How can you make the Herald as, success-&#xD;
ful as the London Times?  That paper is a stock concern, and&#xD;
is very rich."&#xD;
It was started and placed on. its present footing by the&#xD;
mind of one man-4ohn Walters. He'stocked it-.that is true&#xD;
-but he divided the stock among his own family, and the&#xD;
income is enormous. The family, or the stock-holders, rarely&#xD;
interfere with the course of the Times. It is edited by a mani&#xD;
who never writes a line for its columns, while he superintends'&#xD;
the matter for the paper, and rejects or admits the editorials&#xD;
written by the most powerful writers in England," said Mr.&#xD;
Bennett.&#xD;
"PWhy does not the powerful editor write himself ?" asked&#xD;
Marion, with some curiosity.&#xD;
, "Simply that it is human nature for a writer to harp upon&#xD;
one subject too long. He iuns it into the ground. An- editor&#xD;
who is a clever, judicious man, abd who does not write him-&#xD;
self, becomes impatient with the writings of others. He has&#xD;
o hobby of his own, and his rejections of articles frm the&#xD;
pens of the principal writers give no offence and excite no dis-&#xD;
affection, because there is evidently no jealousy on the part of&#xD;
the chief editor. His decisions are wise and prudent ones.&#xD;
Before I leave the Herald, it shall be equally' well and firmly.&#xD;
established, so that when I die it can walk along alone to fulfil&#xD;
its destiny. Now you try merchandising, Marion, but. mark&#xD;
my words, you' will not succeed, and when you get sick of your&#xD;
mercantile ambition come back to me. You have talent, and&#xD;
will succeed as a newspaper writer. It has been my opinion&#xD;
for years. I have tried to develop the' genius you possess,&#xD;
and I have at least made you aware of the fact that you do pos-&#xD;
sess it. Some day it will come out, and I hold it to be a great&#xD;
pity that you do not commence at once, instead of wasting&#xD;
your time in the shipping or any other commercial business;&#xD;
See who is right in the long run.*" Thus spoke Mr. Bennet b&#xD;
and his words sown there produced fruit in after*years, but not&#xD;
until a long series of mercantile losses and disasters had iade&#xD;
Marion Mdnek sensible that the editor was right.&#xD;
-Marion left 'm that evening~ with feelings of the truest re-&#xD;

CHAPTER LXVII.&#xD;
The Conclusion.&#xD;
THE lady who has figured in these pages as Mrs. Woodruff,&#xD;
continued in her business, respected by those who did not,&#xD;
know her well, and retained her standing in society, and in&#xD;
the religious community into which her unparalleled impu-&#xD;
dence had forced her.&#xD;
Her establishment was the most choice and the most distin.-&#xD;
guished of any in the city of New York. It had no equal. Her,&#xD;
management was such that she never came-in contact with the,&#xD;
authorities, and she had, among her 'acquaintances and friends,,&#xD;
many persons high in official' power and influence, who would'&#xD;
haveprotected her from harm had complaints ever been made&#xD;
against her. Such was never the case, ,however-and now&#xD;
that years have passed; 'she is still as flourishing as ever.,&#xD;
We must now return to Marion and the Count. The meet-&#xD;
ing between Marion and Francis Graoper was satisfactory to&#xD;
both-and after several days, the basis of their partnership&#xD;
had been arranged to their mutual satisfaction. Of course it&#xD;
was equally satisfactory to their respective friends. Mr. Wil-&#xD;
son had been consulted by Marion, and his, advice was of&#xD;
great service to the new beginners as merchants on their own&#xD;
hook.&#xD;
The Count Falsechinski paid in a cash capital of ten thous-&#xD;
and dollars for Marion Monek, and Mr. Grasper -paid in the&#xD;
sum of twenty thousand dollars foi' his son. This was the cash&#xD;
capital of' Monek,&amp;amp; Grasper,' and on the first day of January,&#xD;
18-7-, they commenced a general commission and commercial&#xD;
business. -Their office and counting-room was in Broad, near&#xD;
Beaver street.&#xD;
No young Hlouso ever started under more, favorable auspi-&#xD;
ces--they had a sufficient cash capital, and thanks to the elder*.&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
ferent parts of the States and in Europe, they formed coimer-&#xD;
cial connections of the strongest kind.&#xD;
The Count had determined to leave New York with his wife&#xD;
immediately after Francis and Marion had commenced busi-&#xD;
ness. It was further decided that young Grasper should ac-&#xD;
company them, and after his arrival that he- should visit the&#xD;
principal ports in Europe, and endeavor to secure business to&#xD;
the New York firm of Monok &amp;amp; Grasper.. This plan fully met&#xD;
the views of his partner, and also was approved by the senior&#xD;
Grasper. Old Mr. Prime was consulted, and consente- to&#xD;
become one of.the references of the firm.&#xD;
Our history will now leave Marion Mouck settled firmly in&#xD;
his seat as a merchant in New York. He had been through a&#xD;
great. variety of good and evil fortune, and had w-Withstood the&#xD;
temptation of both. He was twenfy-five years old-ambitious,&#xD;
energetic, and determined.  He had a-good share of commer-&#xD;
cial experience-enough to justify his taking the charge of a&#xD;
commercial house.  One of his most valuable counsellors was&#xD;
Mr. Wilson, who came-daily to the counting-room of his young&#xD;
friend larinn.&#xD;
After the departure of the Count Falsechinski, his wife, and&#xD;
Francis Grasper, the old Mr. Grasper never failed to cal and&#xD;
see how the young Marion Monck, his son's partner, was sue-&#xD;
ceeding.&#xD;
We shall not continue the history of our hero beyond this&#xD;
point; he had succeeded in establishing himself as a mer-&#xD;
chant, and that is the second of the four great epochs of every&#xD;
man's life.&#xD;
The other characters in this work have all been fairly dis-&#xD;
posed of-and in tracing out their various careers, a deeply&#xD;
impressive moral may be drawn in each case.&#xD;
Colonel Benson and his lady were in the enjoyment of all&#xD;
those blessings whichgvealth confers, induced by a fair and&#xD;
easy conscience.&#xD;
Middleton Benson was a steady, prosperous, and prudent&#xD;
merchant. His wife, Isabella Granville that was, became de-&#xD;
voted to him-, an excellent mother to the children, and quite a&#xD;
domestic woman in her way.  No tidings had ever reached&#xD;
ner of her brother, since his death had been announced in&#xD;
tne newspapers.&#xD;
The old gentleman Pitt Granville continued to be busy about&#xD;
his affairs, and an inmate of the Asylum at Bloomingdale,&#xD;
where he could receive medical treatment when his quiet fits&#xD;
of insanity made their appearance.&#xD;

&#xD;
VIGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
From his parents Marion Monck heard frequently. They&#xD;
lived on in their quiet Southern home, glad to hear of his&#xD;
success in getting into business" but profoundly ignorant of its&#xD;
advantages. His aunt Mary had become a very scientific wo-&#xD;
man, and frequently wrote to her nephew on such subjects-&#xD;
although he would have valued her letters more had they quo-&#xD;
ted the price of Sea Island or upland cotton-&#xD;
Mrs. Tom Granville resided in Baltimore, and rarely troub-&#xD;
led her head about the Granville relations. She was divorced&#xD;
from Tom by a double, divorce-the Maryland Legislature was&#xD;
the author of one, and grim Death of the second. She called&#xD;
herself a widow, and spent a great portion of ier time 'in the&#xD;
city of.Washington, where she was one of the most influential&#xD;
politicians. A bill could be got through both houses of Con-&#xD;
gress with more ease with her aid than without it---consequently&#xD;
she became a very popular and a very useful woman in legis-&#xD;
lative affairs.&#xD;
Old Josiah Cubson, the laughing Englishman, settled on&#xD;
Staten Island, and became the father of a baker's dozen of&#xD;
daughters..&#xD;
The widow Gaillard, after her husband's death remained in&#xD;
South Carolina with-her mother-in-law, devoting herself to the&#xD;
education of her son. Her father; Colonel Benson,* visited&#xD;
her occasionally.&#xD;
The two  eravian girls, with whom Marion Monek was a&#xD;
great favorite, returned to Peru, where they married revolu-&#xD;
tionary generals-and as their husbands were shot within a&#xD;
year after their respective marriages, (bey became widows.&#xD;
Forty-six Centre street was broken up by the death of its&#xD;
proprietor, and is now a second-hand furniture store., Jemimy&#xD;
the bar-keeper got a situation on the Police.&#xD;
Of the descendant of the old Dutchman Van Hagen we have&#xD;
given a full narrative up to the hour when we leave him a,&#xD;
merchant in 'New York, where he must" do or die."&#xD;
Their subsequent career must be the subject of a future&#xD;
volunW, should it eyer be written4&#xD;
