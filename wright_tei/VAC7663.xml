CHAPTER I.&#xD;
ON the outskirts of the forest of.Hallate&#xD;
resided Pier-re Aubin, the gamekeeper of&#xD;
the neighboring wood of. Bsassseuse. His&#xD;
sinall but comfortable dwelling was not far&#xD;
from the banks of the sweet little stream the&#xD;
Aulnette, and at no great distance-from the&#xD;
city of Paris.&#xD;
Through the vista of ,the forest might be&#xD;
seen, approaching the house, -a laughing&#xD;
merry group of peasants who were retui-ning'&#xD;
from the Parish church of Flewrines, where&#xD;
they had been in procession, to present at&#xD;
tgie Baptismal Font, ;the first-born :babe of&#xD;
the gamne-keeper, and hil spouse, the pretty&#xD;
Ogcile Robert. ,&#xD;
Had the infant been .the long-desired' heir&#xD;
to riches and grandeur, its entrance on the&#xD;
theatre .of existence, could not have been&#xD;
greeted with a warmer welcome than -was&#xD;
bestowed on the girl Philiberte. Yet was the,&#xD;
little one not of the sex that had been ar-&#xD;
depitly desired by the husband or the father&#xD;
of the young wife and m~othet .&#xD;
This rural festival was attended by young&#xD;
and old from all parts of the neighborhood,&#xD;
and the whole day was -a succession of&#xD;
dances, laughter, discharges of musketry, re-&#xD;
&#xD;
lieved by- refreshments, and plentuous liba-&#xD;
&#xD;
tions of the light wines of the country.&#xD;
:The weather .was gloriously propitious (pr&#xD;
this merriment, which was carried on without&#xD;
doors, on the .green sward, under the shade&#xD;
of the magnificent, trees-whilst within 're-&#xD;
clinaed the delighted mother of three days&#xD;
on a couch of snowy whiteness., She wpis&#xD;
coquettishy dressed, for the occasion, in her&#xD;
most ihecomning cap, ruffled to the throat -ini&#xD;
fine linen and lace gind adorned with a pe&#xD;
fusion .of jribands, and on her hands wee&#xD;
white gloves, as though she were a: bride.&#xD;
At her feet reposed her little girl softly eli-&#xD;
soonced in eider-do.gn.&#xD;
Hlbw beautiful and interesting Cecile look..&#xD;
ed in her 'yew happiness, as she smiled on&#xD;
the pledge of conjugal affection.&#xD;
-Pierre Aubin seated by their side regarded&#xD;
hlis wife and child, alternately, with proud&#xD;
satisfaction-and well he might do so-for&#xD;
he had braved the 'threat of death and de-&#xD;
2strtiction to obtain the charming Cecile, for.&#xD;
his~bride !":- Frequiently during the enteia~r&#xD;
nient' did he leave his guests awhile, thus to&#xD;
contemplate these dear objects of his love'.-&#xD;
So heapipily had time ypassed awayt~&#xD;
evening arrived before any'oriethoughtit so&#xD;
late, 'Then in thsalargest apartment ofit&#xD;
'house was apgead out a feast 18r whicl thk&#xD;

8'&#xD;
present manor called 'La Grange' had fidence he rejoined his company saying to&#xD;
been laid under contribution; but as the j himself,-&#xD;
&#xD;
fashion of the country required that it should&#xD;
be within sight of the convalescent, in whose&#xD;
honor it was given, the door of Cecile's&#xD;
room was left open and the company at table&#xD;
were seated within view, in order to afford a&#xD;
prospect of their enjoyment.&#xD;
With rustic, national, politeness, the hap-&#xD;
py guests posted themselves around the well-&#xD;
covered board, one expecting a night of' in-&#xD;
nocent hilarity and good cheer, to 'terminate'&#xD;
a day of pleasure.&#xD;
A thick fog exhaling from the low rich&#xD;
marshy ground added to the darkness of the,&#xD;
night and east ~t murky veil over the game-&#xD;
keeper's hoiis~ Whilst, however, without&#xD;
all' was silent and dark, within was light,&#xD;
~h'eerfulnes5"and merry noise. The i~inging&#xD;
'of 'glasses, 'the crack 'of the, fire, and&#xD;
above all the 'thousand little pleasantries of&#xD;
word and deed-so foolish to repeat, to retid,&#xD;
or if out 'of place and unsuited to the occa~&#xD;
sion.-.-.but which not only seem, but are in&#xD;
reality so' delightful and eOtertaining when&#xD;
*hen they are opportunely brought forward.&#xD;
PierreAubin alone seemed restless, and he&#xD;
frequently left his place at the table, under&#xD;
various little pretexts, to satisfy himself~ that&#xD;
his Cecile and babe were safe and well.&#xD;
:'- Think not that it was merely; as he assert-&#xD;
ed, to retail to her the witticisms of the&#xD;
guests that he so often repaired tct the chain-&#xD;
j~er. No! whilst the smile was on his lips&#xD;
and affection in his eye, his heart was a prey&#xD;
t9 a sad presentment.&#xD;
~ ~oftly, he murmured to himself' as he bent&#xD;
oyer his sleeping b~be'and. smiling wife&#xD;
'May God. grant me vigilance and strength&#xD;
to guard against the hatred y.'hick is on tile&#xD;
~watch, and i~he vengeance s~eking. to 1k sated.'&#xD;
In imagin~ition, Pierre mn4e his lpve a:&#xD;
s~ield of protection for these helples~objects&#xD;
of, his lender solicitude, and regaining cort-&#xD;
&#xD;
'I defy both hatred and revenge: they&#xD;
cannot deprive 'me of wife and child!&#xD;
The father of Cecile, 'a worthy old veteran,&#xD;
had drank the health of his idol Napoleon,&#xD;
and of his former Colonel,.so often that he&#xD;
had becom~ inebriated, but very joyous, and&#xD;
he proposed singing the popular revolution-&#xD;
ary air-the Marseillaise Hymn. When at&#xD;
the second verse, distinctly was heard in the&#xD;
distancec, the dismal shriek of a screech-&#xD;
owl, twice repeated.&#xD;
'Who is the ill-omened musician who&#xD;
dares to accompany me in this strain? 'in-&#xD;
quired the singer, Decadi Robert, stopping&#xD;
abruptly and looking angrily around' for&#xD;
Nicholas Godard, a notorious jester who had&#xD;
eontributed much to the entertainment of the&#xD;
company by his practical jokes. Had~ he&#xD;
been absent, Decadi would have' been at no&#xD;
loss to whom to 'attribute the unpleasant in-&#xD;
terruptuon, and would have known how to&#xD;
pay him off for it, but the facetious plough-&#xD;
boy had not staTted from his place.&#xD;
~ I will go on with my song,' said the old&#xD;
soldier.&#xD;
'Do so, by all means;' exclaimed' every&#xD;
one except Pierre Aubin who, though none&#xD;
remarked, had started and turned deathly&#xD;
pale at the cry which had stopped the sin~ih~&#xD;
of his father-in-law. Looking 'towhrds' the&#xD;
chamber where his young wife was reposing,&#xD;
Pierre repeated quite lOw, the Words already&#xD;
used-&#xD;
'Hatred and i'evenge I defy you! You&#xD;
cannot deprive rite of w~fr and child.'&#xD;
'The 'chorus to 'the' second verse was just&#xD;
ended, and, like the 'crow in 'the fable, the&#xD;
grandfather r of baby'Philiberte waS opening&#xD;
his large mouth for the 'third stanza, when&#xD;
'again came the dismal cry of the owl, sound-&#xD;
ing nearer than before.&#xD;
' 'Ah, indeed ['The crean~re is 'determined&#xD;
&#xD;
REGINA.&#xD;
&#xD;
not to let me sing by myself,' remarked Dc.&#xD;
cadi Robert. Then for the first time observ-&#xD;
ing thi~t his son-in-law was greatly disturbed,&#xD;
he said: 'Why, Pierre, you are trembling,&#xD;
you shake like an aspen leaf.'&#xD;
'I tremble indeed, say you? Not in the&#xD;
least,' so saying, Pierre seizing hold. of a&#xD;
glass of wine to show how steady his hand&#xD;
Was, raised it to his lips-but set it down un-&#xD;
tasted~ for he felt it was impossible.&#xD;
'What wonder that he is put out a bit,'&#xD;
said the Godmother. 'Is there not cause&#xD;
for it? This is a bad omen on a christening&#xD;
day. The almanac says,-When the owl&#xD;
sings at the feast, beware, for death *is on&#xD;
the watch!'&#xD;
'Yes it isquite true that we may fear the&#xD;
owl, Every one knows that. hut then&#xD;
there is no danger when some one imitates&#xD;
its cry. I would lay a wager that what we&#xD;
have just heard comes from some one, some&#xD;
wag who is amusing himself as a screech-&#xD;
owl-that's all, depend upon it,~ sai4 Nich9-&#xD;
las Godard.&#xD;
'Are you sure of that?' inquired Cecile,&#xD;
*whom the floise had alarmdd also, and who&#xD;
raising herself up had drawn the sleeping&#xD;
Philiberte to her side.&#xD;
Certainly I am very sure of it,' replied&#xD;
the clown, 'and to prove it I will reply to&#xD;
the call, and I flatter myself I can do the&#xD;
thing a little more naturally than that laugh-&#xD;
ing fellow, whoever he is.'&#xD;
Before Pierre Aubin had time to forbid&#xD;
him Nicholas, uttered such a tremendous cry&#xD;
and made so comical a face, that the laughter&#xD;
interrupted for a time was renewed by the&#xD;
whole assembly who burst fok~th in. shouts of&#xD;
mirth.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the uproarious hilarity,&#xD;
Cecile's husband, who was listening atten-&#xD;
tively, caught the sound of a third cry-but&#xD;
this time evidently at a greater distance from&#xD;
the house. He aros~, saying, in an offhand&#xD;
&#xD;
sort of nianner, int~nded'.to prevent his wife&#xD;
being uneasy.&#xD;
'flow can you all be talking so about dwIs&#xD;
and screech owls? The fumes of wine hive&#xD;
reached our heads and made us hear strange&#xD;
things. I know what makes the noise. The&#xD;
stable door at the other end of the court&#xD;
yard has been left open~. and the least wind&#xD;
makes it creak on its 'old rusty hinges,' said&#xD;
Pierre. AulAn.&#xD;
'The stable door,' repeated Nicholas,&#xD;
'That's' a good one I It is another tune It&#xD;
will sing when it wants to say-' shut me if&#xD;
you please.'&#xD;
'The fact is,' gravely remarked Decadi,&#xD;
'there in no re~embli~nce between the ci'~y&#xD;
that we heard, and the creaking 0r a doot~'&#xD;
'Can' it be any thing elsn?' anxiously in-&#xD;
quired Cecil~.. '  '          ' ' 7&#xD;
'Bali!' replied Pierre,' yo~ tire mistaken~&#xD;
all of you. I am right in my conjecture, I&#xD;
know. Let us wager that you will hear ijo..&#xD;
thing more after I have shut the stable door.'&#xD;
'But will you 'agree not to' speak to the&#xD;
owl if I bet with you?' asked Nicolas.'&#xD;
'Certainly I will promise not to speak t~&#xD;
it,' answered the game-keeper, assuming~ a,&#xD;
ludicrous serio-comic look.&#xD;
'Very well sir, in that case I bet yOu a&#xD;
leg of beef, to be eaten on Sunday next at&#xD;
Vandore's, in Prambourg, that it is a person&#xD;
who is counterfeiting an owl out there.'&#xD;
"Done! I take the bet!' said' Pierre'&#xD;
Aubin shaking the extended hand of Nichias'&#xD;
Godard.&#xD;
The affair of the wager being settled, the&#xD;
game-keeper was' going out of the' house,'&#xD;
when a thought coming to him he turned back'&#xD;
to Cecile's room and tenderly embraced ' hi~&#xD;
wife and Child, then went forth into the yar4~&#xD;
As he was crossing the threshold, Nicholas&#xD;
called after him,-&#xD;
'Remember, if you speak to~ theoWi, ~r&#xD;
rather, to the pretended owl, the wage~ 4k~&#xD;
&#xD;

'Pierre Aubin made no reply bnt.wa!kedi&#xD;
phtowards the place he' had designated.&#xD;
The company Soofl set agoing- by some&#xD;
pleasantry of Nicholas', ceased -to hi~tei~ t~&#xD;
the retreating foot-steps of' the game-keeper,&#xD;
bnt songe and jokes r~ipidly suceeedihg-e~ch&#xD;
ntlier, more than a quarter of an hour' elapsed&#xD;
before any one remarked the length of time&#xD;
that Pierre had been absent. At lt(st some&#xD;
one expressed wonder as to what, could be&#xD;
keeping him so long, and each of the gm~ests&#xD;
instantly looked as if the same question had&#xD;
just occurred to him or her.&#xD;
- -Decadi Robert, setting his glass upenthe&#xD;
table~,- exclaimed,-.-' I don't approve of this&#xD;
fun at all, when we are met together to' he-&#xD;
sodial, n6 slipping away say I. It is y6ur&#xD;
fault, Nicholas, that Pierre has played us this&#xD;
~rick,? continued the ex-grenadier of' the&#xD;
first Consul's guard.'&#xD;
'Mine l' cried Nicholas astonished at the&#xD;
accusation.&#xD;
'That is very unjust. Did I ask him to&#xD;
go? 'Was it n~t he who bet that it was not&#xD;
s4~rne joker who was playing s~reeeh-owl,&#xD;
when-it was quite plain and certain that-.--'&#xD;
* 'l3e quiet' interrupted Decadi--.' I drink&#xD;
no more until Pierre is among us and in&#xD;
or4er to bring him back I will g0 and-look&#xD;
for him'&#xD;
As 'Decadi. arose from table on' announi~-&#xD;
ing his intention, the guests could -d~ -ne' less&#xD;
than imitate the example of the director' of&#xD;
the Fete.&#xD;
What is the matter said' the deaf old bell-&#xD;
ringer who was quite puzzled to account for&#xD;
his being left alone at - the 'festive board&#xD;
where he-h~d eNculated all would 'h~veIre'.&#xD;
irmined for hours.&#xD;
'~Wh'mW are -you going to-do?' he"enquir.-&#xD;
ed.&#xD;
-- We are~ gQin'g to dance,' shouted Nicho-&#xD;
las in his ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
The old'rrman did not hear what Nicholas&#xD;
said, but as usual ~Ath him he-pretended he&#xD;
did. On more than one'occaskui that ve~y~&#xD;
evermiixg- the plougb.boy had made sport of&#xD;
the bell-ringer's deafness-but in this 'in-&#xD;
stance those of the corrtpariy who did not&#xD;
participate in the charm~of Decadi took up'&#xD;
the-jbke arid repeated the ~words of the jester,&#xD;
we are going to-dance" so loudly and so&#xD;
loudly and 'eo often, that they ultimately pe-&#xD;
netrated the' tympandm~ of the deaf man.&#xD;
'Very well; I' understand,' said he, 'one&#xD;
cannot dance without music. Pierre is gope&#xD;
for the Fiddler.'&#xD;
Pleased with his penetration, he secured a&#xD;
fat old body, nearly as deaf as himself, fdr'&#xD;
his partner in the first cotillion. The women&#xD;
then repaired to the inner room where Cecile&#xD;
was in strange agitation at her husband's un.&#xD;
accountable absence, and the men followed&#xD;
the old soldier Decadi into the court.&#xD;
The whole party searched around every-&#xD;
where; but in vain, and only in whispered&#xD;
accents had they spoken, fearing to add to&#xD;
the' alarm of th~ I wife -- when suddenly&#xD;
Nicholas shouted at the top of his voice-&#xD;
'Halloo, Pierre, we aratired of seeking you&#xD;
-speak-tell us where you are.&#xD;
Decadi rushed on him and covered the&#xD;
mother of the inconsiderate bawler with&#xD;
both his hard hands, saying..-.&#xD;
',Fool that thou art-.-thou wilt terrify my&#xD;
poor girl.'&#xD;
The ulisehief was already done, and to the&#xD;
grief and annoyance of the father, Cecile ap-.-&#xD;
peared at the door of the house.&#xD;
In' spite of the entreaties of her friends she&#xD;
had-thrown off the counterpane and spring.&#xD;
~ng out of bed, bare-foot and lightly clad~&#xD;
she reached tie outer door. Her father, with&#xD;
rough tenderness, caught her in his arms,&#xD;
saying, as he carried her back t~ bed,-&#xD;
'What are you thinking of, Lihi? Do you&#xD;
~pe~t to be a good mother if you take sueb-&#xD;
&#xD;
*1&#xD;
&#xD;
RE9IN~&#xD;
&#xD;
freaks -as these? There, take your little pe&#xD;
and nurse hex; that will be much better that&#xD;
joining~ in our sports?&#xD;
'&amp;amp;o. let m~ go father4 There is no spori&#xD;
in this; something has happened t~ Pierre&#xD;
and I must know what it is.'&#xD;
'Nonsense, child? said Decadi, striving t&#xD;
hide his own rising alarm. 'Nonsense&#xD;
don't you understand the bellowing of Nicho.&#xD;
laa? It is only for fun that he goes on so-&#xD;
he kitows well enough where Pierre~ is, t~pd&#xD;
so do I. Balanchet told me just now1'&#xD;
'Well, then,' responded Cediledoubting.&#xD;
ly, 'if you know, why can't you tell me.'&#xD;
'No, my darling, I will not tell you any-&#xD;
thinguntil you are snug in. bed and your&#xD;
sweet infant in your arms; see, she is awake&#xD;
apd crying for you.&#xD;
Greatly puzzled what to saynext was De-&#xD;
cadi,. but he had gained his point. The&#xD;
young mother had done as her father insist-&#xD;
ed, and he had also gained time to re-&#xD;
flect.&#xD;
'Now, then, tell me as you promised.-&#xD;
Where is Pierre gone? You see I am herp,&#xD;
calm and comfortable.'&#xD;
'He is gone to St. Frambourg for suga9&#xD;
and nutmeg to make some punch-.--.that is&#xD;
all.'&#xD;
Nichola~ was about to speak, but Decadi&#xD;
trod heavily on his toe and sternly whisper-&#xD;
ed,-.-.&#xD;
'If you cry out or speak a word I will&#xD;
kill you.'&#xD;
Cecile seemed dissatisfied with the expla-&#xD;
nation, so, to pacify her, her father wished&#xD;
to send off the guests to meet him, for he&#xD;
sai%1 gaily,-&#xD;
'Cecile is afraid she may lose her good&#xD;
man.'&#xD;
But~no one stirred, and Nicholas, quite&#xD;
mal-.a.propos, as usual, inquired4-...&#xD;
',Where must we go for him~ii'&#xD;
'Where neighbor Balanehet told us, to be&#xD;
&#xD;
t sure,' said Decadi,, pushing the un1uel~y'&#xD;
speaker out~of the room, and that with n~&#xD;
gentle hand.-&#xD;
'Oh, father!' exclaimed Cecile, 'I know'&#xD;
that you' are afraid' some evil has befallen&#xD;
him.'&#xD;
'If that is the case,' cried the- coward&#xD;
I Nicholas, '~, for one, will not venture after&#xD;
him.'&#xD;
'What, are .you not gone?' interposed&#xD;
Decade. *I see how it is. You- must have&#xD;
weapons and lights, soft-hearted chickens that&#xD;
you are.'&#xD;
So saying the veteran got a couple of axes,&#xD;
* a scythe, some cudgels, and a few torches,&#xD;
and distributing them among the party-so&#xD;
lately joyous, but now so timorous and de-&#xD;
jected-.--.he dispatched them on their relu~--&#xD;

to guard against such another prank as Cecile~&#xD;
had just played them.&#xD;
In vain the kind old man tried to soothe&#xD;
the fears of his daughter, whose anxiety 2&#xD;
seemed so much greater than so short an ab.&#xD;
sence would appear to warrant. Her alai~nV&#xD;
became contagious and her sympathisirig&#xD;

'Death!' gasped out her aifrighted corn-&#xD;

'Great God! is my child going out o&#xD;

little picture of the Virgin. There, where&#xD;
the iiead'of my bed used to be. That ~ic-&#xD;
tu~'e~h~etds something, doe&amp;amp;it not V&#xD;
The father removed the picture, but as&#xD;
the wall was in the shade he did not discover&#xD;
anything, so he replied,-.-.&#xD;
'No, child! I see nothing.'&#xD;
'T~ake the light, then, and look again; I&#xD;
promise you will see something.'&#xD;
'Decadi brought the light and holding' it&#xD;
dlose to the wIAall, he exclaimed, in utter&#xD;
amazement,&#xD;
'Sacrc-bteu! why here is a rifle ball sunk&#xD;
in the wall. What wretch took aim at such&#xD;
a mark?'&#xD;
* '~1'hat is what Pierre must know, but he&#xD;
will not say. As for me, however, I can&#xD;
guess.&#xD;
Oh, for goodness sake! do tell us,' cried&#xD;
the assembled group.&#xD;
'Yes, Cecile-speak. Let us hear the&#xD;
name,' 'added Decadi.&#xD;
'No, my dear father, I can not-I must&#xD;
not, until Pierre ,gives me permission. I've&#xD;
promised him not to name any one whom 1&#xD;
may suspect.'&#xD;
'This is showing too much pity for a mi~-&#xD;
erabie wretch-a Awould-be' murderer, me-&#xD;
thinks,' observed the old soldier,. 'However&#xD;
powerful he may be, Pierre need' not fear&#xD;
him. One man has as good a chance as&#xD;
another.'&#xD;
Cecile only replied, in alow voice,-..K&#xD;
"Perhapp it was 'not a man!'&#xD;
No one spoke.&#xD;
Decadi Robert remained some time gaz-&#xD;
ing on the ball, then placing the light on the&#xD;
table,"he'iit to the little window and stood&#xD;
looking into the thick darkness that envelop~&#xD;
ed the"bnilding.&#xD;
&amp;amp;~dre~ry hillf hour passed thu~ in agoniz-&#xD;
&#xD;
in~ .suspense,' which momentarily became&#xD;
more intense.&#xD;
At length the words, 'They come-they&#xD;
are returning!' broke from tIm lips of the&#xD;
listening either, in feverish accents.&#xD;
The lights drew nearer rapidly.&#xD;
Cecile, withoutt rising, t~oked at her father&#xD;
beseechingly, and in stitjed tones, said,-&#xD;
'Pierre, my husband; is he with thee?'&#xD;
The old man' leaned out of the window, the&#xD;
better to~ be able to distinguish those who&#xD;
were advancing.&#xD;
'And my husband?' again implored Ce-&#xD;
eile.&#xD;
Decade Robert, who' could not see more&#xD;
than the outline of the figures, would have&#xD;
,called out, but his voice failed him, he was&#xD;
speechless from emotion-for, alas, the ab-&#xD;
sence of alacrity and exultation in the ap-&#xD;
proaching party proclaimed too clearly, to&#xD;
the anxious watcher, the want of success they&#xD;
had to announce.&#xD;
'And my husband?' ejaculated Cecile, for&#xD;
the third time.&#xD;
I do not see him yet,' replied her father,&#xD;
~ evident emotion.&#xD;
Again the agitated young woman sprang&#xD;
from' her bed.&#xD;
The old man quitted his post at the win-&#xD;
dow and rushed to oppose the entrance of&#xD;
the crowd into his daughter's presence until&#xD;
he should have learned the result of their&#xD;
search.&#xD;
But he was too late. Cecile in her eager-&#xD;
ness was not to be baffled. She caught&#xD;
I~icholas, who was foremost, by the arm,&#xD;
and demanded,-&#xD;
'What has happened? What have you&#xD;
seen?'&#xD;
The plough-boy was pale as a corpse, and&#xD;
Ipoked terribly scared. Heeding not the&#xD;
signalss made by Decadi Robert, for~ him not&#xD;
to tell, he bluntly'answered,-&#xD;
'The fact is, we do not know what has&#xD;
&#xD;
become of Pierre. He has not been at S~.&#xD;
Frambourg, at all events, and at the 'cross-'&#xD;
roads near the forest, we saw the hedges&#xD;
beaten down and traces of men and horses,&#xD;
in mnch confusion, as if there had been a&#xD;
terrible scuffle going on in that place quite&#xD;
recently.'&#xD;
'0 Heaven! robbery or murder!' cried&#xD;
Cecile, in' bitterangaish.&#xD;
'No, the rascals were not robbers,' rejoin-&#xD;
ed Nicholas. 'Pierre had no money about&#xD;
him, or anything worth stealincr. but his&#xD;
handkerchief he has lost, for we found it in&#xD;
a ditch close to the place of the squabble, or&#xD;
fight, or whatever it was. See, here it is,&#xD;
there is no mistake but it is it, look and you&#xD;
will know it.'&#xD;
As he spoke, the fellow drew from his&#xD;
pocket a neck-kerchief, twisted, knotted and&#xD;
torn in many places.&#xD;
Father Decadi stretched 'out his hand to&#xD;
get hold of it, in hopes of'persuad'ing his poor&#xD;
daughter that Nicholas was mistaken; but&#xD;
Cecile, quicker than he, seized on the crimi-&#xD;
nating article.&#xD;
With trembling fingers she unfolded it ;&#xD;
then, 'examining it at 'the light, she discover-&#xD;
ed the marks of the teeth and traces of foam&#xD;
and blood, indicating that~' in a desperate&#xD;
struggle, it had b'een used as a gag to stifle&#xD;
the cries of the victim.&#xD;
As this conviction forced itself upon her,&#xD;
a cry of agony' and despair escaped the mis-&#xD;
erable wife, who pronouncing, with ineffable&#xD;
terror, the name, 'Regina Gazeran,' fell ~&#xD;
fainting and senseless' into the arms of her I&#xD;
commiserating and astounded friends. '' t&#xD;

But, before explaining the cause of this&#xD;
~r~y~erious disappearance, permit us' to. re-&#xD;
late what occurred to him on that memorable&#xD;
night.&#xD;
When Pierre Aubin, in great emotion, had&#xD;
taken leave of~ his wife and babe and quitted&#xD;
the cottage, as already mentioned, instead pf&#xD;
going to the stable-~-.as his fatiher-in-law and&#xD;
the. guests supposed was his intention, being&#xD;
misted as to the true object of his absence-&#xD;
Pierre passed through the outer gate of the&#xD;
court-yard and was at once in the open&#xD;
country.&#xD;
The night being so very dark, or~ coming.&#xD;
from the light within, it took some time be-&#xD;
fore he could make his.way through the sur-&#xD;
rounding obscurity.&#xD;
Behind, his cottuge-honie shed its friendly&#xD;
rays, lil~e a Pharos of the deep, and by this&#xD;
aid he trusted to be able, on returning, to&#xD;
guide his steps to all that his heart held&#xD;
dear.&#xD;
PIerre had proceeded but a shot t dist~mJ4ce&#xD;
when he saw, not far from him, a light.--&#xD;
Three times it slowly raised on high, and&#xD;
three times it is as slowly ~owdred.&#xD;
'It is he-it certainly must be him,' said&#xD;
the husband of Cecile to himself in a mur-&#xD;

soun{&#xD;
'Good!' thought he, 'I am not far fron&#xD;
him,' 'and taking a fresh start he cdntinne&#xD;

After awhile, a~ain seeing a glimmer o&#xD;

Theb Pierr&amp;amp; listened intently, but flo an.&#xD;

no sound was to be' heard.&#xD;
At this straiige silence he became perplex-&#xD;
ed. It was quite possible that he might' be&#xD;
led into a snare, so'he stood ready t6 retrace&#xD;
his steps on the 'slightest' 'suspicious move-&#xD;

t~tn~le Jn every limb, and pointing to the&#xD;
place when~e the sound came, he stammered,&#xD;
'Do you hear, master,~ Oh dear,. I am so&#xD;

So saying, he i'ose up, hid, the lantern un-&#xD;
'' .'''~.'&#xD;

treaties of Pierre, he fled like a deer, and~ was&#xD;

Le~t thi~is sud~ply alone, without having&#xD;
7'&#xD;
heard a word of the importan~ int~lIigence&#xD;
which he sought to learn, Pierre bent his ear&#xD;
the ground to ascertain whether the noise&#xD;
which had' put to flight the foolish boy did&#xD;
'proceed from h0rse's hoofs, or was&#xD;
m~e1y produced by the wind through the&#xD;
trees. Nothing but the howling of a siriart&#xD;
0.&#xD;

'~'h~ l~ors~mer ave halted, thought Pierre,&#xD;
a~d reverting to the singular demeanor, and&#xD;
abrupt departure of Petit Chauvel~he became&#xD;
i~neasy. He looked towards his cottage, the&#xD;
light f~orn which was barely visible' and he&#xD;
approached himself for having imprudently&#xD;
wandered so far from it.&#xD;
For a second time did the stout-hearted&#xD;
g~mmp~keeper feel ,the fearful presentiment&#xD;
wWch had drawn him~ to Cecile and Phili-&#xD;
berte, but resolutely be began to walk home-&#xD;
'v~~ards. As lie was going he heard a sound&#xD;
as of stealthy'steps on the grass, and the&#xD;
c~ack1jng of dry br~iches, sometimes on&#xD;
onps~de and then on the other-but it was&#xD;
i~1e~s straining his vision, nothing could he&#xD;
4iscetn except once? a shadow seemed to&#xD;
g~im~e aloi~g the ,path-way.&#xD;
'Who g~es'there?' said the gamekeeper&#xD;
boldly, ,as he walked towards the moving&#xD;
figure. No. answer~ was returned ..r- the&#xD;
sha~lo~ se,~med to have sunk into the earth.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pierre advanced a step nearer the s ot and&#xD;
again challenged with the practiced v~ice of&#xD;
a ~oldier-' 'Who~goes there?' .&#xD;
Hardly had he uttered the last word when,&#xD;
from different points four men rushed on him,&#xD;
surrounded, and violently assaulted him.&#xD;
The husband of Cecile was uncommonly&#xD;
tall and, what is rare, strong in proportion to&#xD;
his height. He had mote than once had to&#xD;
contend with the most athletic and most des-&#xD;
perate, poachers, and had'taught them that in&#xD;
a handeto hand encounter, when he could&#xD;
see what he was about, he did not fear two&#xD;
foes at once. But what could he do when&#xD;
taken by surprise, in the dark, and attacked&#xD;
'by four resolute assassins'?&#xD;
The almost superhuman efforts of despair&#xD;
cotild not save him. Being convinced that&#xD;
he must be overpowered, iPierre, after fighting&#xD;
manfully for some time in silence, attempted&#xD;
to call for help, but a gag stopped his m~puth.&#xD;
Putting forth all his strength in order, if pos-&#xD;
sible, to free himself from, the suffocating&#xD;
impediment, the game-1~eeper by a mighty&#xD;
effort freeing one hand for a moment, he&#xD;
tore away the gag.&#xD;
This was his own neck handkerchief,&#xD;
which Nicholas Godard found shortly after-&#xD;
wards on the scene of strife, and which he&#xD;
bro~ight back to the young mother.&#xD;
As soon as Pierre Aubin recovered the&#xD;
power of frep respiration, he felt stronger,&#xD;
and with a fearful blow in the chest of, one~&#xD;
his adversaries, he felled him to the ground&#xD;
-but unfortunately the man in falling had&#xD;
caught hold of the game-keeper and drag-&#xD;
ged him down with himself.&#xD;
Pierre was uppermost 'and kept the other&#xD;
down, who not vanquished, though under.&#xD;
neatl?, clung so firmly to, him as to' prevent&#xD;
his rising up. Thus interlaced in a nervous~&#xD;
embrace, equally trying to both; they rolled&#xD;
and struggled on;the ground.&#xD;
Each could count the deep-drawn respira-&#xD;

with knee to kn~e,'breast to bi~e~st, and fa&#xD;

felt 'the satin of a mask over the feattires&#xD;
his vigorous antagonist.&#xD;
Whilst each was meditating a despera&#xD;
efVort as 'by tacit consent they slackened tI&#xD;
struggle, to gain a little' bread'?, ~he pther a&#xD;
Sassins, also masked; rnsh~d on Pierre, for&#xD;
ed hitn to let go his hold and tied his han&#xD;
behind his back, and stopped the victim&#xD;
mouth with another gag. The' man thus r4&#xD;
leased by comrades was able to arise, and&#xD;
his turn assist them.&#xD;
Pierre Auhin, still Iaying'oh the groun&#xD;
and kept in a painful position by strong cori&#xD;
found it impossible to give utterance to mor&#xD;
than stifled sighs. Two of the men no~&#xD;
to4k hold of his legs, as yet unfastene(i&#xD;
whilst the other' two supported hi~ head an&#xD;
'shoulders. Sometimes carrying, sometime&#xD;
dragging him along the 'gr'ound,'they got hin&#xD;
to a short distance where the party h'ahed.'&#xD;
One of them gave a whistle and alinost in&#xD;
stantly a fifth (masked~)' person, appeared&#xD;
leading a horse by the bridle.&#xD;
This latter accomplice was 'small, thick-se'&#xD;
and short. He seemed to move with diffi'&#xD;
culty. possibly y it was' on account 'of hi's in&#xD;
firmity that he had not taken part 'in th'c&#xD;
struggle. He held the bridle whilst the 'cow.&#xD;
ardly conquerors of the game-kee&#xD;
the unfortu man off ' per raised&#xD;
'nate          the ground, 'and&#xD;
hoisted him upon the~ hoi'se.&#xD;
When he was placed thereon, 'to their&#xD;
far~cy, they tied his feet under the belly of&#xD;
the animal. This of couse' would prevent&#xD;
his having the power to free himself from his&#xD;
thraldom,' but it would not ~obviate the risk&#xD;
of his destruction in case' of 'tuinii~ short&#xD;
3''&#xD;
round amongst the trees, or should the horse&#xD;
fall, 'or sudd'eiily set off on a gallop:'&#xD;
Now there 'seemed little doubi but'thebri-&#xD;

&#xD;
forehead 4own to cover the eyelids of tke&#xD;
u}jfiinate Pier~, w)~iJst his knees rested&#xD;
on ~lie gari'ie.~keeper's chest.&#xD;
As.if the Fates find conspired in favor, of&#xD;
the villains, the very hor5lis -assisted in pre.&#xD;
serving the 4eath-Iike silence. No neigh, or&#xD;
restless stamping betrayed to the anxious&#xD;
searchers their vicinity.&#xD;
* The last hope of deliverance ~lies in the&#xD;
heart of the captured man as the lights re-&#xD;
cede, and the voices of the noisy party led&#xD;
by Decadi are faintly borne on the night-&#xD;
breeze.&#xD;
Once more the midnight marauders are&#xD;
under way,, they have returned to ihe path,&#xD;
the leader has re-lit his torch, and away they&#xD;
gallop at a pace that will soon put them be-&#xD;
yond all danger of a rescue.&#xD;
As for Pierre, each moment he expected to&#xD;
*draw his last breath. His head swam, his&#xD;
eyes were extremely bloodshot and painful.-&#xD;
1~l~e clouds, seemed to fly above his head, and&#xD;
the trees were dancing in confusion, as, lay-&#xD;
ing in that uncomfortable position, he whiz-&#xD;
zed pa~t theufi. He seemed transported to&#xD;
an unknown worht, where everything was&#xD;
strange, fantastic, inverted, and in constant&#xD;
motion.&#xD;
For ~vo weary hours did this unnatural&#xD;
,Cour~e last, at the end of which time they&#xD;
halted.&#xD;
Pierre was released from the horse and laid&#xD;
on the ground.-Then his feet were tied to-&#xD;
gether, and he conjectured that his riding was&#xD;
over, 'But whn~t,' thought he, 'are they&#xD;
going to do with me?'&#xD;
The leiu~Ier of the masked party pli~ced his&#xD;
hr~nd on the heart of tbe prostrate man, to&#xD;
ascertain if he yet breathed.&#xD;
This certainty obtained, Pierre was imme-&#xD;
diately blindfolded. Then four of the men&#xD;
raised him from 4te gr9~nd ~nd ,9!irried him,&#xD;
he~d~o~em9st, after having turned themselves&#xD;
around with their burden several times, to&#xD;
&#xD;
prevent the unlikely possibility of his having&#xD;
had presence o(mind, or perception enough&#xD;
to recognize the route they -had come. tI'he&#xD;
'deformed one remained&#xD;
of the horses.~ , probably to dispbse&#xD;
Pierre Aubin, exhausted by the rough&#xD;
transportation and the struggle that had pre-&#xD;
ceeded it, as well as the whirl in which his&#xD;
senses had been kept-utterly weakened in&#xD;
body, but fearless in mind-listened with in-&#xD;
tense curiosity for some indication of what&#xD;
kind of a place he was in.&#xD;
At first, as they proceeded (carrying him&#xD;
along) he knew by the footstep~ that the soil&#xD;
was sandy.&#xD;
Presently they trod on harder ground, and&#xD;
after a while'firmly, as on flagstones.' When&#xD;
they had advanced a little farther they stop-&#xD;
ped, but it was only to change the position of&#xD;
the prisoner.&#xD;
Two men went in front and took firm&#xD;
hold of his feet, and the other two supporting&#xD;
his head and shoulders, they resumed their&#xD;
march.&#xD;
By the slanting position of his body, and&#xD;
the jerks he felt at each step they took, Pierre&#xD;
surmised that they were descending a stair.&#xD;
way. ~He was sensible of the cold, damps of I&#xD;
a subterranean passage.                  4&#xD;
He no longer felt the outer air breathing&#xD;
on his face, and drying the perspiration that&#xD;
rolled profusely from' his forehead, as at'in- I&#xD;
tervals, during the transit, had been th~&#xD;
ease.&#xD;
Now, indeed, was the bold huntsman seized&#xD;
witha shiver of terror. He thought they I&#xD;
might be bringing him ALIVE to this place,&#xD;
to let him die of hunger and despair in a I&#xD;
j** tomb!&#xD;
Onward they moved in the depths of this&#xD;
long, subterranean vault, and by and by, the t&#xD;
distantt strains of joyous music reached the ii&#xD;
ear of the b~iwildered Pierre.,     '  '&#xD;
'Can this be possible, or is it but the' ilIu- a&#xD;
sion of a confused brai~i? Am I going crazy?'&#xD;
thought he. '&#xD;
But nearer and clearer does the music b&#xD;
sound, and at length there could be no doubt h&#xD;
on the poor fellow's mind that he actually a&#xD;
heard a full orchestra-yet how strange I- d&#xD;
where could he be?          .&#xD;
Again his' posture was shifted, and tIi~&#xD;
gui'me-keeper was 'carried horizontally. 'lie d&#xD;
felt that his 'bearers were walking ott level ei&#xD;
ground, but their feet slipped, as ifit Were ti&#xD;
&#xD;
darn p and slimy. A smell, as if light and air&#xD;
frtd long been excluded, pervaded the place,&#xD;
and ~was 'almost'suffoeaming.'&#xD;
Here the four 'men paused, but within&#xD;
setting down the heavy burden they had car-&#xD;
ried so far..&#xD;
Pierre could distinguish a key grating in a&#xD;
lock, then belts creaked in the rusty staples,&#xD;
and a door o.'as forced open.&#xD;
From the different sound of the echoing&#xD;
footsteps, and the stoeping'gtit of his captors,&#xD;
it was plain that they were passing through a&#xD;
low door-way which, it appeared, led into .a&#xD;
vaulted passage, somesteps below that 'thro'&#xD;
which they had just come.&#xD;
A second door was opened with a similar&#xD;
noise. 'They crossed another threshold, after&#xD;
which the four enemies of the game-keeper&#xD;
of the forest of Brasseuse, stopped 'for the'&#xD;
last time.&#xD;
The victim of the ambush was deposited&#xD;
on the damp ground, his eyes were unban-&#xD;
daged, and as soon na Pierre recovered from&#xD;
the dazzling light of the torch, distinguish.&#xD;
ad the masked figures who stood around hjrn,&#xD;
contemplating hirni' in silence.&#xD;
Lie next turned to survey the place where&#xD;
he had been thus ~forci bly conveyed, 'and&#xD;
Ireary was the spot.&#xD;
It was a vault, the shape of which was&#xD;
)ctagonal. The only door was narrow and&#xD;
ow.&#xD;
Pierre felt convinced that this was the first&#xD;
ime he'd ever been in it, but, from the gene~&#xD;
al resemblance that such places so frequent.&#xD;
y bear to each other, he could not gleam any&#xD;
information as to whose castle he mi~ht&#xD;
ue in.&#xD;
still was to be heard, overhead, resound.&#xD;
ng in the gloomy stillness of the. dungeons&#xD;
he harmonious cadence of ~he music that&#xD;
ad already caught the' attetition of the cap-&#xD;
itte.-.and also the regular 'measured move-.&#xD;
aents of a dance.&#xD;
After the rnaskers 'had regarded Pierre for&#xD;
6me time, one of them relieved him of rh'~~&#xD;
lood-stairted gag. Then, without' unbinding&#xD;
mm, they 'left him prostrate on the grouzul,&#xD;
nd taking with them the glaring torch, they&#xD;
epart~d, passing into the 'outer vault ~.in&#xD;

Thus was Pierre' Auhiri left alone inihe&#xD;

&#xD;
;:Noticing, shortly, ,a glimmer .of light pro. ~&#xD;
feedingg .frtm without and visible beneath the s&#xD;
door; an invincible desire to ascertain, what&#xD;
~wi%~oing 6n there, prompted the prisoner to&#xD;
.inttkie, a'nattemnpt'to find it out, S&#xD;
By the help of head and knees, his hands&#xD;
un4' feet being tied, he managed to move&#xD;
.along, somewhat in 'the fashion of a worm, ~&#xD;
toward the open space l~elow the door.&#xD;
Placing his'.eye against the, aperture, he&#xD;
saw the ft~ur masked men seated at a stone&#xD;
table, evidently in deiberation. They spoke&#xD;
one after another, in low tones, as if each was&#xD;
deJiver~ing an important opinion. Then' they&#xD;
were silent, and appeared as if expecting the&#xD;
entrance ofsonie one.&#xD;
~sV~f might Pierre imagine that the con~&#xD;
versatiorf deeply concerned himself, but in&#xD;
vain he tried to catch a word of it.&#xD;
It was but a few minutes ere the fifth ac- 4&#xD;
coruplice joined his associates. This was the&#xD;
dwarf who had, with a refinement of cruelty&#xD;
and malice, acted the part of nightmare 1&#xD;
during the journey, and had 'been left to take&#xD;
care of the horses.&#xD;
fle seated himself beside the other and&#xD;
spoke vehemently, but inaudibly to Pierre.-&#xD;
When he had7 finished his, harangue, which&#xD;
was listened to with great attention, the party&#xD;
arose.' The nocturnal council seemed to be&#xD;
terminated.&#xD;
At this momelit, so interesting and excit-&#xD;
ing to the spectator of the scene, he heard a&#xD;
rap on the outer door of the mysterious coun-&#xD;
cil vault.&#xD;
The most powerful-looking of the five men&#xD;
had left'iiis place and was advancing towards&#xD;
the door of the prisoner's cell when this oc-&#xD;
curred, ~a~d Pierre, fearing to be surprised in&#xD;
his indiscreet capacity of eaves-dropper, and&#xD;
thinking that his life, might depend on his ig-&#xD;
norance of what had just passed, drew back&#xD;
as;quickly as 'he was able, to the place where&#xD;
he had been left.&#xD;
it may be assumed that situated as was&#xD;
R~ierre Aubin, and with such intemltions as he&#xD;
peeds must attribute to his enemies, he had&#xD;
little hope of life-~.but yet for 'the sake of&#xD;
wife aud'~child he was willing' to endure a&#xD;
great ,deul rather than~die. '&#xD;
Having regained his place he waitedin&#xD;
in breathless suspence.~-but iw one enteted.&#xD;
Nothing hut.the'strains of loud 'music and&#xD;
cadenced steps above, met his' strainedl e~r.&#xD;
I'he light still showed beneath the~door, and&#xD;
&#xD;
L5~IOUS curiosity prevailed over evei'y con-&#xD;
ideration, so again his painful way was&#xD;
na~le to the ill-fitting door.&#xD;
This time he found a new personage was&#xD;
Ldded to the masked party-A ,woman~(&#xD;
Pierre could not see her face, for it was&#xD;
urned towards the men to whom she was&#xD;
peaking, to low, however, to be heard by&#xD;
uin~, though her gestures denoted auge: and&#xD;
~ resolute imperious will.&#xD;
The lady was in aA'ashionable ball-dress,&#xD;
dazzling, covered with diarhonds, her hair&#xD;
was ornamented ~vith rich and rare flowers,&#xD;
.n her hand was even yet the Bouquet de&#xD;
Ball, and her magnificent shoulders were&#xD;
lisplayed by her low-necked dress. This&#xD;
splendid creature must have stolen away&#xD;
~rom the assembly over head to be present&#xD;
it the secret council which probably was to&#xD;
Kiecide, for life or death, the fate of the&#xD;
wretched man&#xD;
When the lady had finished speaking ~he&#xD;
Lowed graciously to the five masks, and left&#xD;
the vault.&#xD;
The heart of Pierre Aubin bounded with-&#xD;
in his bosom as he saw her fhce; it confirmed&#xD;
his, suspiciQns. He uttered in under tones,&#xD;
and with violent emotion, the same name&#xD;
that Cecile in her despair had involuntary&#xD;
spoken-' Regina Gazeran!'&#xD;
The leader of the party accompanied this&#xD;
lady to the floo?, locked and bolted it after&#xD;
her, then pointing to the vault where Pierre&#xD;
was confined he took hold of the lighted torch&#xD;
and moved towards it. No sooner did the&#xD;
captive-game-keeper seen this motion than he&#xD;
regained his station and awaited his fate.&#xD;
The five men entered together. A ring&#xD;
it appeared was fastened in the wall, and to&#xD;
it Pierre was quickly fastened with a strong&#xD;
chain,:they all then drew up before him, and&#xD;
the chief stepped up to the victim and gave&#xD;
him a blow on the cheek~&#xD;
At this unmrinly insult the blood boiled in&#xD;
the veins of the injured man, he foamed at&#xD;
the mouth, but the excess of indignation de-&#xD;
prived him of the power of speech. To such&#xD;
a brave and worthy man as Pierre 4ubin, to&#xD;
bear this wtta indeed torture. As he trem-&#xD;
bled with impotent rage he heard a derisive&#xD;
laugh; it proceeded from the mslicious&#xD;
4warf.&#xD;
'Eacli successively approached, and in like&#xD;
manner gave the unfortunate man a blow,&#xD;
even the hatE~ful little man, but when his&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
REGINA.&#xD;
&#xD;
turn came, the better to enjoy the atrocious&#xD;
* pleasure of the insult, he stood looking m&#xD;
Pierre earnestly, then with mock pity h&#xD;
wiped, with his own handkerchief, the col&#xD;
sweat of anguish from his brow and the tear&#xD;
of blood from his eyes, then completed a]&#xD;
by the shameful blow.&#xD;
This strange and ignoble infliction ended&#xD;
the four .strong cavaliers knelt in the centr&#xD;
of the vault and by their united efforts, am&#xD;
with help of an iron bar, they raised a ston&#xD;
which had been concealed under the well&#xD;
packed earth which formed the floor of th4&#xD;
vault.&#xD;
A dark gulf was opened beneath. and&#xD;
mephitic vapor exhaled from the aperture.&#xD;
Pierre uttered a cry of horror. rfhe musi&#xD;
and dancing were still sounding with over&#xD;
powering din. But ere the cry could be re&#xD;
pleated, the wretches seized their helpless&#xD;
victim, suspended him by cords attached tc&#xD;
The t?~ongs which confined his arms and legs,&#xD;
and slowly lowered him into the dungeon-&#xD;
abyss.&#xD;
When Pierre. reached the bottom of this&#xD;
horrible pit, the stone that had*covered it&#xD;
was replaced, and the unfortunate man fonnd&#xD;
himself alone, and now, at last hopeless!&#xD;
'My wife! My child!' he exclaimed; but&#xD;
this was all that escaped fro118 his almost&#xD;
bursting heart.&#xD;
During the xvh'1e of this~ foul transaction&#xD;
the prisoner had been unable to recognize&#xD;
his tormentors, whose voices he had not&#xD;
heard, and whose features had been effec-&#xD;
tually concealed by the masks. Nevertheless&#xD;
suspicion of certain persons most likely to be&#xD;
the actors or bettors in the dastardly deed,&#xD;
would intrude, but he repulsed the idea, that&#xD;
it could be them, with horror.&#xD;
After the receding steps of his foes ceased&#xD;
to be heard, all was silent. This silence was,&#xD;
however, but of short duration, and he could&#xD;
make out that some one was in the vault&#xD;
above him. Then he distinguished~ that the&#xD;
stone over his sepulchre was shaken, as if by&#xD;
some one whose strength was unequal to the&#xD;
task of raising it up, for it resisted the efforts&#xD;
to displace it.&#xD;
Hope, the sufferer's steadfast companion,&#xD;
whispered in the ear of the buried-alive. Is&#xD;
it a deliverer?&#xD;
Re-animated by this idea, Pierre aroused&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
The efforts of the person, to move the&#xD;
&#xD;
21&#xD;
&#xD;
s stone, continued. At length it is partially&#xD;
tt displaced, and the light of the torch which&#xD;
e the stranger had brought, shed its rays into&#xD;
~l the gloomy dungeon. 'Courage friend,'&#xD;
s cried Pierre looking up to' his supposed liber-&#xD;
1 ator. The stone gives way, but instead of a&#xD;
friendly face, as the game-keeper had hoped&#xD;
to discern-behold a hideous mask. Doubt-&#xD;
e less it is one of the wretches returned to feast&#xD;
I his eyes on his victim, for he holds the light&#xD;
~ over the yawning chasm and peeps into the&#xD;
- gloomy death.&#xD;
3   ' Cowardly assassin,' cried Pierre, £ At&#xD;
last tell me thy name that Imay curse it.'&#xD;
t The sneering laugh which was the sole&#xD;
reply to these words, revealed the malicious&#xD;
Dwarf who had already caused him so much&#xD;
suffering.&#xD;
* The monster of cruelty rts if, for the time&#xD;
satisfied with the spectacle he had been en-&#xD;
joying was withdrawing himself, when his&#xD;
mask came off and fell at the feet of Pierre&#xD;
Aubin.,&#xD;
The dwarf hastily sprang backwards-but&#xD;
quick as was the movement, he was recog-&#xD;
nised!&#xD;

game-keeper, 'Remember that from the days&#xD;

CHAPTER iii.&#xD;
BEFORE proceeding any farther with the&#xD;
story it may be well fo affix the date of it,&#xD;
by mentioning that at this period Charles the&#xD;
Tenth had been five yekrs on the throne of&#xD;
France.&#xD;
The eldest branch of the house of Bour-&#xD;
bon was verging to a fall-thanks to the&#xD;
combined efforts of those who wished, at&#xD;
any cost, to destroy it, and those who, un~jer&#xD;
pretence of' preserving it from unseemly&#xD;
contact, kept at a distance all who were&#xD;
inclined to afford it substantial support.&#xD;
It was about fifteen years since the new&#xD;
alliance had proclaimed, by its heralds, ~o&#xD;
the absentees, the last lingerers of the&#xD;
great emigration-'Donnez nous la peine&#xD;
d'entrer,' which may be translated 'Be pleas-.&#xD;
'ed t~ come back.' '&#xD;
From 'that time a goodly number of the'&#xD;
noble descendants of ancient races had re-&#xD;
turned to live on their estates, for the most&#xD;
part in a pitiful condition. They were as&#xD;
one may say, wedded to the past, and could&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7663-00000010"/>&#xD;
not be brought to understand the changes&#xD;
and revolutions that time had wrought in&#xD;
social life and public opinion. Acting as&#xD;
thoug.h~ these things were not, they obsti-&#xD;
nately retained their old ways and customs&#xD;
brought back, intact, from exile:&#xD;
In their simplicity these providcial gentry&#xD;
and nobility expected to see renewed the&#xD;
splendor and the arbitrary usages of abso-&#xD;
lute monarchy. They refused to comply&#xD;
with the fashion of the day, even in the&#xD;
natter of dress. Some repaired their delap-&#xD;
itated castle-towers and re-erected the sig-&#xD;
niorial gibbets.&#xD;
The latter-an object of derision ~o those&#xD;
who, passing the castle, perceived it through&#xD;
the court-yard gate-was not altogether. an&#xD;
unused plaything. If deprived of the right&#xD;
to exercise sovereign power, the dispossessed&#xD;
noble could rio longer jiang on it a truly&#xD;
refractory tenant-he consoled himself for&#xD;
his loss of power over the lives of men, by&#xD;
hanging, now and then, some intractable&#xD;
hound to serves a warning to the pack~&#xD;
Amongst these incorrigibles-who made&#xD;
it a point of honor not to admit the march&#xD;
of improvement, and to protest, by their&#xD;
influence and practise, against all innova-&#xD;
tions and every species of reform-it con-&#xD;
cerns us to instance, as foremost, Emeric, Ne-&#xD;
pomucene de Labourdilliere, Marquis of&#xD;
Yalgenist.&#xD;
The domain possessed by his ancestors&#xD;
was so vast, that it was said, that from sun&#xD;
rise to sunset, a ho;se urged to a gallop, and&#xD;
continuing at that pace, could hardly make&#xD;
th~ circuit of it. But the evil days that-&#xD;
came on the territorial Lords had so often&#xD;
and so effectually clipped here-and there&#xD;
from the manor of Valganest, that when *h~&#xD;
Marquis found himself, at the* restoration,&#xD;
again in possession of the 'estate and title&#xD;
of his fore-fathers, the inheritance was re-&#xD;
d~iced to such a degree, that- a very mod-&#xD;
erate walker would, have gained but a poor&#xD;
appetite~ if he satisfied himself with making&#xD;
the toiit~ of the* new Valganest, before his&#xD;
breakfast.&#xD;
The Marquis derived but a very small&#xD;
income from his curtailed estate but, proud&#xD;
and poor, he would have considered his dig-&#xD;
nity compromised had he permitted hi~ far-&#xD;
trier to cultivate the smallest portionn of the&#xD;
ground assigned, since, his return to Valge-&#xD;
riest, to his game. Whilst he exacted rigid&#xD;
&#xD;
respect to the boundaries ~f his preserves in&#xD;
order to secure his own sport, he was utterly&#xD;
unscrupulous about the rights and property&#xD;
of his neighbors, and Emeric de Litbourdil.&#xD;
here encroached perpetually, with spade and&#xD;
plough,' on the limits which he deemed too&#xD;
circumscribed.&#xD;
As all the land that could be seen around&#xD;
the castle had once belonged to his ances-&#xD;
tors, the Marquis called encroachments en&#xD;
the adjacent fields-practical experiments of&#xD;
counter-revolution. By little an(I little he&#xD;
would, no doubt, have got back all the&#xD;
patrimony of the Labourdilliere family if&#xD;
those whom he ik~rong-ed, by putting in prac-&#xD;
tise his political theory, had not loudly&#xD;
spoken of having recourse.to law, to obtain&#xD;
justice, and ascertain how far this system cf&#xD;
appropriation and aggrandizement would be&#xD;
sanctioned.&#xD;
The first peasant who had dared to com-&#xD;
plain to the old gentleman had done so on&#xD;
the occasion of chancing to meet him. Very&#xD;
greatly astonished was the Marquis at his&#xD;
presumption and audacity. This surprise is&#xD;
easily accounted for.' He had returned to&#xD;
his old castle after an absence of thirty&#xD;
years, and -understood not the vocabulary&#xD;
i~rhich the French people had -composed for&#xD;
themselves whilst passing through-Repub-&#xD;
lic, Gonsuh~te and Empire! -&#xD;
The Marquis de Valganest, challenged by&#xD;
the old clown, looked at him with an air as&#xD;
much as to say, 'I do not understand ~ou:&#xD;
Then as he had no desire to waste time in&#xD;
listening to claims put forth in terms equally&#xD;
new to him, he shrugged Ii is shoulders and&#xD;
turned on his heel.&#xD;
After going a few steps the Marquis hap-&#xD;
pened mechanically to look back. - The&#xD;
claimant was still standing where he had&#xD;
left him-but cursing and shaking his braw-&#xD;
ny fist in a threatening manner&#xD;
It was not long before the countryman&#xD;
felt the ill effects of this significant but dis-&#xD;
respectful - gesture, which was more intelli-&#xD;
gible to the Marquis than had been his&#xD;
language.&#xD;
On the evening of that very day, as the&#xD;
man was going front the Hamlet of Bras.&#xD;
seuse, through thi wood of Haut Martel, he&#xD;
was assaulted by some persons, so disguised&#xD;
that he could not recognize them, anu&#xD;
beaten with clubs till he was completely&#xD;
senseless. To crown his misfortune, a short&#xD;
&#xD;
REGINA.                      23&#xD;
&#xD;
time afterwards, his finest stack of cora was&#xD;
struck by lightning (it was said) and con-&#xD;
sumed. As the night was free from thunder&#xD;
or storm, some of the oldest and most inde-&#xD;
pendent minds in the place would not believe&#xD;
that the interposition of Heaven caused the&#xD;
disaster-but the servant girl of the Priest&#xD;
of St. Frambourg took her oath,. that she&#xD;
saw the avenging lightning descend from&#xD;
Heaven on the doomed stack, and on the&#xD;
following Sunday the miracle was proclaimed&#xD;
as Sacred 'Truth.&#xD;
This occurrence, which might have been&#xD;
~u effectual warning to the malcontents, - did&#xD;
not prevent another peasant, more audacious~&#xD;
even than the former, from doing that which&#xD;
the one who had been so roughly beaten had&#xD;
only threatened to perform.&#xD;
Complaint ~vas carried before the prose-&#xD;
cuting attorney for the crOwn, at Senhis.&#xD;
The unlucky constable who was not afraid&#xD;
to carry to the Marquis the summons to&#xD;
appear before the court to hear himself&#xD;
condemned to keep within his own bounda-&#xD;
ries, could not boast of the result of this&#xD;
daring exploit.&#xD;
The easily irritated pride of the old gcn~&#xD;
tlenran, who was altogether ignorant of legal&#xD;
proceedings, took umbrage when be saw a&#xD;
fellow present himself to enunciate an order&#xD;
in a castle (where, except during the revo-&#xD;
lution when things had to be passed over,)&#xD;
no one had assumed the right to enter, save&#xD;
to humble themselves before their master.&#xD;
When the constal)le entered the saloon;&#xD;
Emeric de Labourdilliere was surrounded by&#xD;
his five grand-sons-William, James, Fran-&#xD;
cis, Honore and Antoine. -&#xD;
We ought here to observe that it was no&#xD;
parr of the intention of the official, entrusted&#xD;
with this delicate mission,- to adventure into&#xD;
the interior of the castle in the execution of&#xD;
his duty-on the contrary he only desired to&#xD;
deliver his summons into the hands of the&#xD;
gate-keeper.&#xD;
To this effect he had already, in this lady's&#xD;
kennel, produced his inkstand, and, the pen&#xD;
in his fingers, -was beginning to write in the&#xD;
prescribed French form- 'Speaking to the&#xD;
gate-keeper who has declared herself unwil-&#xD;
ming to sign the--' ~vhen an old servitor&#xD;
appeared at the gate of the lndge and&#xD;
invited maitre Bonaccueji to follow him into&#xD;
the presence of Monseigneur. ' --&#xD;
The invitation was so politely worded and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
delivered in such mild tones, 'that 'it cduld&#xD;
not fail to succeed in entrapping him. -&#xD;
Eustache Jlonaccueil, the contable, a~as&#xD;
i.~aught by it. He ascended the grand~ stair- -&#xD;
case with unfalte~ing step, passed through -&#xD;
the large apartments, that led to the saloon&#xD;
where the old man, awaited him, without&#xD;
hesitation-but no sooner was he ii, the ~e-&#xD;
sence of the Marquis than -his confidei~e&#xD;
began  to  fail.  '    -  -           -  - -&#xD;
The aspect of the grandsoii~ 'df the Mar-&#xD;
quis made the constable uneasy, and' the&#xD;
haughty ironical looks of the old matf~&#xD;
caused iiini to dread soxiie evil intentich on -&#xD;
his part. Very soon was he enlightened oTh&#xD;
the subject, for hardly had maitre Bonaccueil -&#xD;
presented, with fear and tremeling, his ciii-' -&#xD;
tion, to his lordship, when he found himself -&#xD;
pinioned in the strong embrace of vigdrous~&#xD;
arms. In a second he was stripped (,Fhi~S&#xD;
clothing, then he was pitilessly fiog~ed~ a~d~&#xD;
without giving him time to dress himself, the -&#xD;
five young men, with shouts of lau~lhter,&#xD;
turned him out of doors. -&#xD;
The cold was intense, 'but th~ constable&#xD;
felt it not, thanks t6 the kind attention of th&amp;amp;"'&#xD;
old domestic who let loose a couple of&#xD;
hounds which worried and harassed him fob' -:&#xD;
a quarter of a league.&#xD;
This repetition of an infamous amusement, ,&#xD;
which had often been acted in old times -&#xD;
with success, cost the Marquis dear, in thq&#xD;
present instance. In the meaiitime how- -&#xD;
ever, he was glad to h~re an ojportuhity'-&#xD;
ci showing~ the heirs of his name - hoiV this&#xD;
sort of thing used to be aranaged.&#xD;
The poor devil of a constable tva~ hunted&#xD;
by the dogs so far' that- even after they had&#xD;
ceased to persecute him and' he was beyond&#xD;
their reach, he continued his xac~, thinking&#xD;
they were at his heels, and smaiting from the&#xD;
wounds their pangs had infliefed, utitil he&#xD;
fell exhausted and senseless at his own&#xD;
door.&#xD;
The neighbors raised him from the ground&#xD;
tad' placed him in bed. Nine days alter&#xD;
hat the unfortunate man died ot dd~rious&#xD;
fever.&#xD;
In days of yore it 'wouk~ only have cost&#xD;
the Marquis some twelve hundred francs to&#xD;
put a stop to the hub-bub excited - by sui~h a&#xD;
result to a similar pleasantry.-.--but time ha~I&#xD;

&#xD;
of revolutions, saw himself on the point of&#xD;
piiying with his liberty and honor, for this&#xD;
error in his reckoning.&#xD;
A criminal trial was in store for him, and&#xD;
the Gendarmerie had already crossed the&#xD;
threshold of' the castle to arrest its lordly&#xD;
owner~.&#xD;
Emeric de Labourdilliere saw, from his&#xD;
windows, the police penetrate insolently even&#xD;
to the court of Honor. He turned a look of&#xD;
despair on the portraits of his ancestors as&#xD;
though to implore aid to repel the intrud-&#xD;
ers.&#xD;
Some ages back, in the good old times,&#xD;
ih9trumpet's spund from the towers of Val-&#xD;
gariest would have sufficed to call numbers&#xD;
to the defence of 'the castle, and prepared to&#xD;
hold out to the death, or at least to fight&#xD;
long and valiantly before they yielded. But&#xD;
now resistance iva s impossible from without&#xD;
-and within the Marquis had not even his&#xD;
five grandsons to assist him-they were ab-&#xD;
sent on a hunting party.&#xD;
As the Brigadier and his men mounted&#xD;
the steps of the hall-door, indignation and&#xD;
shame at his lost power and present impo-&#xD;
tence caused the bl~od to mount to the head&#xD;
A' the old man. Regret for past times was&#xD;
is last thought-he exclaimed-' Unhappy&#xD;
rance 1-Unhappy age 1' and apoplexy e-&#xD;
guished his life on the spot as these words&#xD;
assed his lips.&#xD;
When the Gendarmes entered the room&#xD;
hey, found only a corpse, the clenched fists&#xD;
nd curved lips of which seemed yet to pro-&#xD;
st against the sacrilegious proceedings of&#xD;
evolutionary justice.&#xD;
This event put an end to judicial action&#xD;
the matter, for Eustache Bonaccueil had&#xD;
ied without being able formally to declare&#xD;
at the grandsons of the deceased Marquis&#xD;
ad taken an active part in the brutal treat-&#xD;
ent he had experiencqd. Besides, the old&#xD;
rvant,' Bartholomew, (out of respect to the&#xD;
emory of his late master) deposed on oath&#xD;
at the constable went away from the cas-&#xD;
dressed and unhurt, after leaving the&#xD;
tatior. He, also, took the precaution to&#xD;
atter in the woods through which the'&#xD;
~used man fled~ the missing garments&#xD;

gait t~ be generally credited vh~t the con-&#xD;
ble had been way-laid,) by some one who&#xD;
&#xD;
bore him ill-will, and thus cruelly treated on&#xD;
his way back from the castle.&#xD;
The widow who had flattered herself with&#xD;
the hope of obtaining heavy damages, reaped&#xD;
nothing from the event, bat freedom to take&#xD;
a young husband, which, shortly she did, in&#xD;
the person of the head-clerk of the deceased&#xD;
maitre Boneccucil.&#xD;
We will now go back to the period when&#xD;
th~ old ~Iarquis with his five grandsons,&#xD;
just returned from exile, we' e again in pos-&#xD;
session of Valganest. Thus re-installed, the&#xD;
proud old gentleman Aelighted to sit in state&#xD;
in the largest reception room, (as his fore-~&#xD;
fathers had done,) even when there was no&#xD;
no company at the castle.&#xD;
One evening, as he and his family were&#xD;
thus seated, Bartholomew came into the&#xD;
apartment and respectfully whispered to his&#xD;
master.&#xD;
The valet seemed nervous and embar-&#xD;
rassed. The Marquis knit his brows at the&#xD;
communication. Surprise, indecision, an'&#xD;
ger, all were depicted in his countenance.&#xD;
Some violent struggle convulsed his features&#xD;
and lit up his little grey eyes with fury.&#xD;
Meanwhile Bartholomew awaited patiently&#xD;
the answer which his master hesitated to&#xD;
give.&#xD;
At length the faithful domestic was dis-&#xD;
missed, the Marquis, saying, 'Mind that he&#xD;
waits until I ring, before he enters here.'&#xD;
Then it was a visitor whom the man had&#xD;
announced. Yes! an embarrassing and un-&#xD;
welcome one, as will be seen.&#xD;
The five brothers looked with 'impatience&#xD;
at their grandfather~, but restrained by the&#xD;
habitual respect to which he had accustomed&#xD;
them, they did not venture to interrogate&#xD;
him-and yet they were no longer youths.&#xD;
William and James, twins, had entered on&#xD;
their twenty-ninth year, and Antoine the&#xD;
youngest, the deformed, the same who had&#xD;
been recognized by the captive game-keeper&#xD;
was about twenty-four.&#xD;
The Marquis at last thus deigned to ex-&#xD;
plain-' This is an unlucky day for us, gen&#xD;
tlemen-for I have just had an extraordinary&#xD;
~mnd vexatious visit announced. If the man,&#xD;
who is about to present himself, really be&#xD;
the person he represents-then the late Mar-&#xD;
chioness of Valganest shed torrents of~ tears&#xD;
without cause, arftl for nothing have you&#xD;
worn mourning for these eighteen years.'&#xD;
T~e brothers trembled at this announce-&#xD;
&#xD;
REGINA.&#xD;
&#xD;
ment, and notv their looks demlinded explicit&#xD;
information, to which mute appeal the Mar-&#xD;
quis responded in ~tones of vexation.&#xD;
'He who is coming calls himself, Etienne&#xD;
de Labourdilliere.' 'Our Father!' exclaimed&#xD;
each of the young men risifig up.&#xD;
'Yes, truly, if' he be not an impostor, we&#xD;
are compelled, once more, to see the wretch-&#xD;
ed man who has disgraced our name.'&#xD;
'He must be an impostor,' quickly replied&#xD;
Antoine, the dwarf His four brothers&#xD;
catching and applauding the idea, repeated,&#xD;
'He must be an impostor-He shall be&#xD;
an impostor.&#xD;
The whole five gentlemen then approached&#xD;
the old man's chair and ranged themselves&#xD;
about him, as if to show by this action that&#xD;
they made common cause with the head of&#xD;
the fa'nUy against this new comer, be he&#xD;
Etienne de Labourdilliere or not.&#xD;
Well pleased to see those whom he had&#xD;
taken such pains to inspire, from infancy 1&#xD;
with pride of birth, love for the old systeur,&#xD;
and hatred to Republican and Imperial I&#xD;
Frauce-Erneric smiled his satisfaction, and "~&#xD;
pulling the bell, muttered between his teeth&#xD;
'This man may come.'&#xD;
To make the scene, that is to follow, in- I&#xD;
telligible, we must premise that Etienne de&#xD;
Labourdilliere, who emigrated in 1791, left I&#xD;
his 'vife Marguerite de Gazeran and his three&#xD;
sons, with his father, in England, and him- c&#xD;
self returned to his native land as a spy and t&#xD;
secret emissary to aid the restoration of r&#xD;
Monarchy.&#xD;
That the hopes, honors, and emoluments r&#xD;
held out as inducements to this perilous un-&#xD;
dertaking (liable to be repaid by ignominious&#xD;
death) lirompted many to adventure in the t&#xD;
cause' of the Bourbons, is very probable, t&#xD;
But that some few were actuated by the&#xD;
purest motives of loyalty, sw~iyed by convic~ p&#xD;
tion, and uninfluenced by selfish or interested, ~&#xD;
motives, it can not be denied-and these u&#xD;
accepted the commission of Espionnage as&#xD;
a glorious one, and regarded death in this p&#xD;
connection as martyrdom. ' ' c&#xD;
Of this class was the only son of Emeric. tI&#xD;
When he quitted l~ngland to' counter-revo-&#xD;
lutionize France-he believed lie was obey~. ~J&#xD;
'ing a chivalrous sentiment agreeable to Qod ci&#xD;
and beneficial to hiseountry. But the pre- d's&#xD;
juice of education gave way before the r&#xD;
glorious 'tictS and deeds he witnessed or tli&#xD;
heard related on his way to~Paris. Long he ai&#xD;
&#xD;
struggled consejentiously to repress the eh-&#xD;
thusiasm which by degrees took possession&#xD;
of him.&#xD;
A plot, to murder his first consul, one in&#xD;
which he was compromised 'without having&#xD;
participated in it'-.-finished to disgust hidj&#xD;
and detach him from a cause which allowed&#xD;
of' assassination as a means to attain success.&#xD;
He had the courage to express his indigiia&#xD;
tion at the conventicle from whence the&#xD;
death-signal was to be issued. His accom,&#xD;
places (who had in the first place deceived&#xD;
him as to their true intentions) fancying&#xD;
themselves betrayed by him on whom they&#xD;
so much relied, came very near making hifit&#xD;
pay with his life, his rupture with therri&#xD;
Etienne de Labourdilliere was tiot 'th~&#xD;
man to be easily intimidated, and when he&#xD;
beard, murmured in the assembly of conspi-&#xD;
rators-' He is a traitor-let him die tk~&#xD;
~leatlr of a traitor.' He imposed on them,&#xD;
by the reply,&#xD;
'If within one hour from the moment thai&#xD;

ivhom I ~all not name, to pass by a certain,&#xD;
rpot, which I need not particularise...-.a full'.&#xD;

but be pleased to inform me what motive led&#xD;
you hither? Methinks both of us could&#xD;
have dispensed with this meeting.'&#xD;
'I imagined sir, '~epiied the major) 'that&#xD;
the difficulties through which you have&#xD;
struggled must have straitened your means.&#xD;

was personally esteemed, has enabled tue to&#xD;

of my assistance may be of use. I come,&#xD;
therefore, to place my humble fortune at&#xD;
your disposal, for my father and my sons&#xD;
ought not to have recourse to strangers&#xD;
whilst I have the means to offer them.'&#xD;
The Marquis suffered his son to finish&#xD;
this generous speech, but the flush of indig..&#xD;
nation which mantled his cheek, and the&#xD;
uneasy convulsive twitches of his body&#xD;
showed the difficulty of sitting it out. At&#xD;
the conclusion of it he sprang to his feet in&#xD;
a perfect fury, exclaiming passionately,-&#xD;
'It is the price of the blood of our party&#xD;
that you dare te offer me, despicable wretch&#xD;
that you are l No, never will I touch it!&#xD;
Begone sir, begone!'&#xD;
Etienne de Labourdilliere stood calmly&#xD;
under the explosion of paternal wrath and&#xD;
replied not. After the pause of an instant&#xD;
the old man apostrophising his grandsons,&#xD;
thus delivered himself.&#xD;
'Should any one of you ever accept but&#xD;
a glass of water from this man, that one&#xD;
will I disinherit, and on whomsoever of you&#xD;
who shall except a legacy from him, is my&#xD;
mak~diction already pronounced.'.&#xD;
'My Lord Marquis,' remarked Etienne&#xD;
vith respectful firmness, 'will please to re-&#xD;
member that Major Seignerohles resides at&#xD;
Haut Monte!, near Brasseuse. He will there&#xD;
find him a~ favorably disposed in future, as&#xD;
at present.'&#xD;
Then bowing and saying, 'Father I salute&#xD;
you!' he was leaving the room, but at the&#xD;
door he halted and turned back.&#xD;
'Gentlemen yot~r duty is te accompany&#xD;
me to the stair-case.'&#xD;
The sons looked at each other, but obey-&#xD;
ing the magnetic influence of his eyes, they&#xD;
&#xD;
tuottly yielded obedience, and followed hy&#xD;
all his sons, Etienne de Labourdilliere&#xD;
reached the foot of the stairs.&#xD;
'Gentlemen I thank you,' said the father&#xD;
as they had gained the castle steps.&#xD;
The young men bowed their heads, as if&#xD;
were, in spite of themselves, and each mut-&#xD;
tered~-Father I salute you! and thus ended&#xD;
this singular meeting of the long-estrangen&#xD;
r alatiyes.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
Etienne de Labourdilliere, after this visit u..&#xD;
Valgenest, returned to the dwelling he inhab-&#xD;
ited at Ilaut-Montel-under the designation,&#xD;
Major Seigncrolles, and resumed the almost&#xD;
solitary life he had led there previously.&#xD;
His mornings were devoted to field-sports&#xD;
and evenings to reading. His only domestic&#xD;
was Catherine Chauvel, the mother of the&#xD;
little shepherd boy who was instrumental in&#xD;
leading Pierre Aubin into the snare, as&#xD;
already described.&#xD;
The Major and Decadi Robert, having&#xD;
both served in the Imperial Army, a kind of&#xD;
acquaintance naturally sprang up between&#xD;
them. Time and mutual esteem converted&#xD;
this into actual friendship.&#xD;
It was after the disbanding of the army of&#xD;
the Loire that the person known as Major&#xD;
Seignerolles had come to reside at Ilaut-&#xD;
Montel, where he had been for about eight&#xD;
years, when one day he said to the old&#xD;
soldier-' Father Decadi I need your assis-&#xD;
tance.'&#xD;
Greatly surprised was tne worthy fellow at&#xD;
these words and he looked puzzled.&#xD;
'Well, will you not grant it?' continued&#xD;
Etienne.&#xD;
'You surely must be joking Major-&#xD;
'you who obtained my pension for me-you,&#xD;
who lent me two thousand francs to repair&#xD;
my house and stock my Iitt'e farm, can want&#xD;
no aid from meunless it be to shoot some&#xD;
game for you, or execute some commission&#xD;
at Senhis, in which case I am most completely&#xD;
at your service.&#xD;
'You are mistaken, Decadi. It is to&#xD;
~obtain a place for me!'&#xD;
'A place is it? In what Diligence then,&#xD;
you have but to name it.'&#xD;
'Wrong again; I want a permanent situa.&#xD;
tion.'&#xD;
'For yourself?'&#xD;
&#xD;
|!&#xD;
&#xD;
SEGINA.&#xD;
&#xD;
28&#xD;
&#xD;
It is tiearly the same thing as for myself.&#xD;
He fer whom I wish to procure it, interests&#xD;
me nearly as much. I need not say what tie&#xD;
binds me to him.'&#xD;
'I do not ask you to do so, Major, but to&#xD;
whom am I tt make application?'&#xD;
'To Mademoiselle de Gazeram She has&#xD;
considerable influence and power in her&#xD;
Uncle's house and I know that they are&#xD;
dissatisfied with the present game-keeper.&#xD;
This is the appointment I should like you to&#xD;
procure for my p~'otege.'&#xD;
Pardicul' said the old grenadier, 'you&#xD;
would have better success yourself, 'if you&#xD;
would only speak to the lady, for mi~ny times&#xD;
have both Uncle and Niece said to me,&#xD;
"Why does not Major Seignerolles come&#xD;
like a neighbor and visit us? In the country&#xD;
it is well to see one another, we shall be glad&#xD;
to receive ~&#xD;
'I go no where-least of all to the house&#xD;
of a Gazeran,' replied Etienne in a gloomy&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
'That settles the matter. I will speak to&#xD;
the young lady myself.'&#xD;
After the silence of a moment, Decadi&#xD;
Robert hazarded the inquiry,&#xD;
'Who may the person in the neighbor-&#xD;
hood be, for whom you want the situation?'&#xD;
He is not of these parts.'&#xD;
'Ahs, I see what you'are about. Some old&#xD;
soldier, like you or I, for whom you kindly&#xD;
wish to secure a good berth in his age!&#xD;
Diable! rph)t will make it more difficult to&#xD;
obtain the situation-for youth is a recoin-&#xD;
mendation at Gazeran.'&#xD;
'Then our claimant will suit, for he is but&#xD;
twenty-three. lIe has returned from Spain:&#xD;
and wounded too,' said the Major replying to&#xD;
a contemptuous shrug of Decadi's shoulders,&#xD;
at the mention of a campaign, which was&#xD;
generally considered by the people as little&#xD;
more than a military parade-th'ough in&#xD;
reality it had its heroes and its victims.'&#xD;
'Is it possible he has' then seen service&#xD;
and been in battle. I did not know there had&#xD;
been any blood shed, but since you say so, I&#xD;
am convinced such has been the case.'&#xD;
The result of this conversation was that&#xD;
Decadi was fortunate enough,' (as he then&#xD;
considered it,) to interest the Mademoiselle&#xD;
Gazeran in the stranger for 'whom the desired&#xD;
situation of game-keeper was promised, and'&#xD;
thus he announcect his success. 'The place&#xD;
&#xD;
REGINA.&#xD;
&#xD;
29&#xD;
&#xD;
is carried by assault-he has only to present&#xD;
himself.'&#xD;
'Then, my friend, you may have the pleas.'&#xD;
ure of informing him that he is thus provided&#xD;
for.'&#xD;
'Why, where is 'the young man?'&#xD;
'At yourown hou'sel'&#xD;
'How soat my house!'&#xD;
'Yes, indeed, Decadi, he has been there foi~&#xD;
the last three hours.'&#xD;
'Then you sent him?'&#xD;
'Who-I? I never saw him. He know&#xD;
me not, nor do I, as yet, wish myself to be&#xD;
known by him.'&#xD;
'lie must, however, I suppose, know,&#xD;
that.'&#xD;
'He knows,' interrupted the Major, 'that&#xD;
Decadi Robert, to whom his Mother has sent&#xD;
him, means to get' him some good employ'~&#xD;
ment, if possible, because, she said, Decadi is&#xD;
his worthy Uncle.'&#xD;
The ex-grenadier looked at the Major in&#xD;
surprise, as his words' were so completely.&#xD;
enigmatical, and he inquired,-&#xD;
'Come now, Major, are you in' earnest,~?&#xD;
What is the 'meaning of this? Am I uncle,&#xD;
to the young man in question?'&#xD;
'Yes, without doubt, that you are mos~&#xD;
assuredly. Was not your Mother married,&#xD;
(the second time) to the keeper of the con-'&#xD;
ciergerie qf Paris?'&#xD;
'True, Sir.'&#xD;
'Had she not a daughter by that second&#xD;
union?'&#xD;
'Yes.'&#xD;
'And the name of that daughter was&#xD;
Euphrosine Aubin?'&#xD;
'It was.'&#xD;
'Well, she was thy si.&#xD;
had she riot?'       ster, and had a son,&#xD;
'I must again reply yes,. lInt the father&#xD;
no one knows, he must have been some&#xD;
Noble-an aristocrat I suppose'-.--muttered&#xD;
the old soldier.&#xD;
Decadi Robert, however, was not one of&#xD;
those who carry their respect for family'&#xD;
honor to that pitch which heaps execrations&#xD;
on the nearest relatives who may, years ago,&#xD;
have brought disgrace on the name they'&#xD;
bear. Nor was it an age or a country,&#xD;
where and wherisuch things were viewed by&#xD;
the generality of people, in any station, in the&#xD;
heinous light that serious christians coil&#xD;
sistently regard such improper occurrences ~&#xD;

not destined to be united on earth, there is a&#xD;
Heaven where, after our probation here is&#xD;
ended, we may hope to meet without shame&#xD;
or impropriety where all is beatitude and&#xD;
virtue.'&#xD;
When Decadi Robert returned home,&#xD;
Pierre Aubin was there, as the Major had in-&#xD;
formed him.&#xD;
The young man had one of those open,&#xD;
manly countenances which inspire confidence&#xD;
and affection at first sight. his manners&#xD;
and conversation ~vere pleasing, and his air&#xD;
even noble and commanding. In short, he&#xD;
soon made such a favorable impression on&#xD;
the old couple and their only Living child, t~ie&#xD;
pretty Cecile, that in a very few weeks the&#xD;
future marriage of the young people was a&#xD;
settled thing.&#xD;
At the time when Pierre Aubin was am&#xD;
pointed to the office of protector of the game&#xD;
in the forests belonging to th~ Gazeran-&#xD;
family, at the recommendation of Regina de&#xD;
Gazeran, that lady ~vas in her twehty-seventh,&#xD;
year, ahd here claims some notice, as about&#xD;
to appear a very important personage.&#xD;
.Ttliadernoiselle, then, Was at this period in&#xD;
the full perfection of her great beauty, ttnd&#xD;
had been sought in marriage by numbers ;&#xD;
but her remaining single during the lifetime&#xD;
of her uncle, was the sole condition imposed&#xD;
as the Price of her inheriting his immense&#xD;
wealth.&#xD;
'Phis restriction to celibacy had, hitherto,&#xD;
caused no grief of heart to Regina, the ahso-&#xD;
lute power she possessed over every one, Qfl&#xD;
her uncle's domain, and the unlimited~hd&#xD;
uncontrolled sway which she ~xercised ~was,&#xD;
to her, of itself happiness enough to com-&#xD;
pensate for her acquiescence in the prohibi-&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
31&#xD;
&#xD;
lion regarding a matrimonial tie. But from&#xD;
the day on which she first beheld the young&#xD;
and, handsome Pierre Aubin, a change came&#xD;
over the haughty dame!&#xD;
A sudden, violent passion took possession&#xD;
of her heart; and she did not even seek to&#xD;
expel or combat it after she had discovered&#xD;
the nature of her interest in the new game-&#xD;
keeper. All she attempted' to do, was to&#xD;
conceal her insensate fancy from the obser-&#xD;
vation of her doting uncle and the public.&#xD;
Months passed ere her preference was al-&#xD;
lowed to be so visible, to the object of it,&#xD;
that he could attribute the flattering interest&#xD;
she bestowed on him nu longer to simple be-&#xD;
nevolence.&#xD;
Pierre Aubin was, also, preoccupied with&#xD;
his own tender passion for the pretty and&#xD;
amiable Ceeile, which caused him td be less&#xD;
clear-sighted in remarking the love which he&#xD;
had unintentionally excited. Nevertheless,&#xD;
he could not always remain ignorant of the&#xD;
impression he had made on the high-born&#xD;
beauty. game-keeper trembled at the prospect&#xD;
of 'the miser~i his prophetic fears foresaw&#xD;
this love would draw down on his gentle&#xD;
Cecile and himself. He tried to disbelieve&#xD;
the evidence of his senses. He gave no ~n-&#xD;
couragement to her advances, and would not&#xD;
understand the language of her beautiful,&#xD;
eyes when they betrayed the intensity of her&#xD;
admiration of him.&#xD;
How well guarded was his heart by the&#xD;
image that reigned in it-that of the modest&#xD;
loving countenance of his affianced Cecile~&#xD;
At last came the moment that 'was to try&#xD;
the power of principle 'and virtuous love 'to&#xD;
resist the temptation of the syren's delirious~&#xD;
passion for him. There was no longer a pos-'&#xD;
sibihity of pretending to mi~nnderstand that&#xD;
the niece of his lord and master chose to"&#xD;
overlook the, usually considered insuperable,&#xD;
difference of birth and station.&#xD;
Pierre Aubip could not return this love ; '1&#xD;
and, as an honqrable man, he wished to put '~&#xD;
an end to' her unavailing hopes without tin. 'a&#xD;

32&#xD;
&#xD;
REGINA.&#xD;
&#xD;
tured the experiment, - 'If Miademoiselle&#xD;
could but know how very dearly I love my&#xD;
c~9usin Cecile!'&#xD;
At this announcement, Regina de Gazeran&#xD;
fell ~ the ground, as though she had been&#xD;
shot!&#xD;
Possibly, the seeming swoon that ensued,&#xD;
mi~ht have been a snare for Pierre Aubin, a&#xD;
last hope for Regina! She might have&#xD;
instantly perceived, that at once to kindle&#xD;
the torch of love in his pre-occupied heart,&#xD;
was out of the question; but that pity once&#xD;
excited, love might succeed.&#xD;
Frightened, beyond measure, the faithful,&#xD;
betrothed lover of Cecile bent over the noble&#xD;
lady, and regretted having spoken out so&#xD;
bluntly; and he eagerly tried to restore\ her&#xD;
to consciousness.&#xD;
It is perfectly true, that Pierre was vehe-&#xD;
mently in love with his affianced' one, and&#xD;
prided himself on remaining constant find&#xD;
true to her; nevertheless, it was not in his&#xD;
power to help feeling admiration, in gazing&#xD;
at the beautiful woman before him.&#xD;
Must we confess it? Candor compels the&#xD;
avowal, that, in the secret recesses of his&#xD;
soul, Pierre's vanity began, to be agreeably&#xD;
flattered at the persuasion, that he, the game-&#xD;
keeper, had actually smitten the heart of the&#xD;
beauteous, accomplished, -and much-sought&#xD;
heiress, to such a degree that she was dying&#xD;
of love for him!&#xD;
If this were a weakness, at his age, it was&#xD;
but natural.&#xD;
'Oh, ho~v magnificently beautiful she is!'&#xD;
he involuntarily e~tclaimed aloud, as, with&#xD;
palpitating heart and feverish delight, he&#xD;
looked on her reviving color. 'No, I must&#xD;
not, cannot love thee !-yet how shall I ever&#xD;
be able to forget thee?'&#xD;
As these words were-pronounced, Regina&#xD;
slowly opened her now languishing eyes.&#xD;
The surprise affected by the lady on find-&#xD;
ing herself supported by Pierre Aubin, was&#xD;
expressed so well, so naturally, that he began&#xD;
to fancy he was somewhat astray in his con-&#xD;
jectures, and that his vanity had deceived&#xD;
him when he attributed her fainting to his&#xD;
confession of love for Cecile.&#xD;
Regina had recovered her sense of dignity&#xD;
and decorum, and, withdrawing from hi~ re-&#xD;
spectful support, she said,-&#xD;
'Pierre I thank you for your attention.&#xD;
No doubt it would have been desirable that&#xD;
on s~uch air occasion of1 ilbiess, Louise ray&#xD;
&#xD;
own maid, or Cecile your cousin, had been&#xD;
in the way to render assistance, however, it&#xD;
could not be foreseen-and in future should&#xD;
such a faintness come over me whilst in your&#xD;
presence, I' have to request, beforehand, that&#xD;
you do at once hasten to the nearest habita-&#xD;
tion and bring the first peasant girl you meet.&#xD;
Any woman understands what to do, under&#xD;
such circumstances, infinitely better than a&#xD;
This was sai4 in a tone that might well be&#xD;
mistaken for the coldest indifference, mmd&#xD;
she also continued in a similar vein, as if the&#xD;
thought had just occurred to her mind.&#xD;
'I do not nsl~ you to keep my sudden faint-&#xD;
ing-fit, a secret. It is known that I am sub-&#xD;
ject to this unpleasant occurrence, besides&#xD;
were you to endeavor to preserve silence on&#xD;
the. subject, your manner might be embar-&#xD;
rassed, and carry an appearance of there&#xD;
being a secret between you mind ~- whilst&#xD;
between Pierre Aubin, the game-keeper, and&#xD;
the lady of Gazeran Castle, there can be&#xD;
no such thing.'&#xD;
Regina made this speech in the haughtiest&#xD;
manner conceivabk~, and in strange contrast&#xD;
with her previous t~ondescention, then with&#xD;
a patronising, rather than obliged manner,&#xD;
once more expressing her thanks, she walked&#xD;
homewards.&#xD;
At the last words and parting looks of the&#xD;
lady, the whole brilliant fabric, that had been&#xD;
erected by vanity on th~ supposition of her&#xD;
love for him, fell to the ground, and Pierre&#xD;
remained 'stupefied with amazement, he was&#xD;
vexed at himself for having ever supposed it&#xD;
possible.&#xD;
Shouldering his gun, which he had propp-.&#xD;
ed against a tree, when he flew to raise the&#xD;
lady from tho 'cold grass, he exclaimed&#xD;
mentally as he walked away in a disconsolate&#xD;
mood.-&#xD;
'I was a presumptuous fool-an ass! She&#xD;
cares not for, me after alL l3ctter though,&#xD;
that it is so.' Nevertheless he said to hint-&#xD;
self' once more-' How very beautiful she&#xD;
is I'&#xD;
Althoug'h Mademoiselle had permitted him&#xD;
to sp~ak of the meeting in the wood, and&#xD;
what had passed there, Pierre Aubin did not&#xD;
~neflti9n it to~ any one.,. He would even&#xD;
glady have forgotten that in Regina's pres~&#xD;
ence dazzled by her attractiptls he had twice&#xD;
beesi obliged to invoke thoughts of Cecile to&#xD;
pr~veiit his eyes misleading his heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
More perhaps to obliterate such ideas than&#xD;
as the result of his love to Cecile, on the&#xD;
evening of that day. Pierre redoubled his&#xD;
attentions to her. The innocent confiding&#xD;
girl, rejoiced visibly at this more than usual&#xD;
display of feeling, and her affection made him&#xD;
experience remorse for his fleeting admira-&#xD;
tion of Regina, as though he had really been&#xD;
faithless in heart.&#xD;
Not long did this cloud overcast the peace-&#xD;
ful vision of the game-keeper's love which&#xD;
reverted wholly to his Cecile, the true mag-&#xD;
net.&#xD;
As for Regina, she now avoided, as much&#xD;
as heretofore she had sought, meeting Pierre,&#xD;
and when accident brought him into her&#xD;
presence, her dignified look~ and distant&#xD;
manner confirmed the impression, that he&#xD;
must have been mistaken in the supposed&#xD;
nature of her sentiments towards hii~m.&#xD;
Thc part which the lady was acting, how-&#xD;
ever, was not sustained without considerable&#xD;
effort. ~Many times had she, when alone,&#xD;
felt indignant to think that, with her be&#xD;
and rank, her first look had not brought to&#xD;
her feet. the man ~vhom she, so elevated, had&#xD;
deigned to honor, with a preference! Car-&#xD;
ried away by a passion, which the indiffer-&#xD;
ence of Pierre heightened instead of extin-&#xD;
guished, she was almost tempted to cast&#xD;
aside disguise and let her words express the&#xD;
feelings of heart, saying, ' Oh, love me as I&#xD;
love you!'&#xD;
Such an entreaty, as from the lips of her&#xD;
~migh-born suitors, she hud received with dis-&#xD;
dam, but which she would have' hailed with&#xD;
delight from the humble game-keeper.&#xD;
However, for a time, she managed- to tri-&#xD;
umnph over these wild impulses, but, in&#xD;
secret, she shed tears of rage and shame as&#xD;
she thought of Cecile, her innocent and&#xD;
unconscious rival.&#xD;
'Oh, to think that I should not be able to&#xD;
supplant her, ~nd yet be unwilling to relin-&#xD;
quish the hope of prevailing over the con-&#xD;
stanef of Pierre Aubin!'&#xD;
Thus spoke the proud beauty to her&#xD;
omost self, and the exclamation which had&#xD;
escaped from the man whom she fondly&#xD;
luv~d, 'Oh, how magnificently beautiful she&#xD;
is!' sounUed in her ears and kept alive her&#xD;
hopes of ultimate success.&#xD;
Regina had 'flattered herself that Pierre&#xD;
would have felt the loss of favor, and been&#xD;
anxious for a renewal of her previously gra-&#xD;
&#xD;
cious and attractive manner. But her co- I&#xD;
quettish hauteur had failed in its object, and J&#xD;
she saw that she must change her plan of'&#xD;
attack, make a compromise with her prid~&#xD;
and dignity, and advance to meet the hear&#xD;
reluctant to respond to her own. In accord-&#xD;
ance with this resolution she contrived to&#xD;
get Cecile to the castle under the pretence&#xD;
of wishing her to execute some delicate em-&#xD;
broidery.&#xD;
On her return the pretty rustic spoke of&#xD;
her delightful visit in terms nf rapture, and&#xD;
the flattering distinction bestowed on her by&#xD;
the Lady Gazeran, was hailed with pride and&#xD;
pleasure by the parents of Cecile.&#xD;
Pierre Aubin, alone, was dissatisfied and&#xD;
unrejoiced, he felt that son~e fresh snare was&#xD;
concealed, by this sudden advance, and that&#xD;
it boded another struggle for which he had&#xD;
no desire. He had come off victorious once,&#xD;
but he feared to renew the risk. He had,&#xD;
therefore, declined going to the castle to ree&#xD;
his betrothed safe home, as had been ar-&#xD;
ranged by the condescending mistress of the&#xD;
Lordly HaIls, ai~d well did he kuow how to&#xD;
interpret, the circumstance, that the charm -__&#xD;
ing lady, Regina, had suddenly been taken&#xD;
with a fainting fit when it was announced&#xD;
that Decadi Robert had come (instead of&#xD;
Pierre Aubirt) to escort his daughter back&#xD;
from the castle.&#xD;
It was, indeed, a blow alike to the love&#xD;
and the pride of the infatuated Regina, for&#xD;
she did not deceive herself as to the motive&#xD;
that kept Pierre away.~ It was not his duty,&#xD;
as game-keeper, that could cause him to&#xD;
substitute Decadi for himself on such occa-&#xD;
sion. What coutd it be but to avoid meet-&#xD;
ing her? Thus was she foiled1 and unable&#xD;
to put in practise the acts by which she had&#xD;
fully intended to set herself off to advantage&#xD;
by contrast with Cecile, who, guileless and&#xD;
and totally devoid of suspicion, was filled&#xD;
with gratitude for the l~indnss and attention&#xD;
which had been shown her, and she expa-&#xD;
tiated to her cousin Pierre on~ the beauty,&#xD;
talents, and gracefulness of Regina Gaze-&#xD;
ran.&#xD;
In vain did the young man strive to turn.&#xD;
the conversation. Cecile was so touched&#xD;
with the kindness lavished on her by the&#xD;
great lady that, (as Regina had calculated)&#xD;
she could speak to her lover of nothing else,.&#xD;
and her praise and admiration were couched&#xD;
in the language of youthful enthusiasm.&#xD;

REGINA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Once, during the dangerous commenda-&#xD;
tions of her new friend, Pierre Aubin man-&#xD;
aged to silence his fair cousin completely,&#xD;
hy saying to her,-&#xD;
'It seems to me, Cecile, that 1 love you&#xD;
less the more you discourse about your visit&#xD;
to ~iazeran.'~&#xD;
Cecile did not inquire of her lover how&#xD;
her enthusiastic praise of the lady who had&#xD;
received her so kindly, was displeasing to&#xD;
him-but, loving so warmly, so tenderly, she&#xD;
would scrupulously avoid mention of the&#xD;
name Regina de Gazeran.&#xD;
it has been remarked, that the noble&#xD;
dame of the castle waited but an opportunity&#xD;
to renew the perilous attack, on the game-&#xD;
keeper, which she discovered (with woman's&#xD;
keen perception) that he feared to encoun-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
Much time did not elapse ere an event&#xD;
occurred which was favorable to the wishes&#xD;
of the enchanting temptress.&#xD;
Philiberte Robert, the mother of Cecile,&#xD;
was attacked with a grievous sickness, in&#xD;
fact, of such a nature, that her life was&#xD;
despaired of. This served as a pretext of&#xD;
which Regina eagerly availed herself, to&#xD;
make a show of interest in the peasant girl,&#xD;
by daily visiting the sick' mother, and thus&#xD;
she secured a daily meeting with Pierre&#xD;
Aubin.&#xD;
Death speedily seized his destined prey.&#xD;
With kindest protestations, and every ap-&#xD;
pearance of sincere affection towards Cecile,&#xD;
Mademoiselle de Gazeran insisted on remov-&#xD;
ing her from 'the house of mourning to the&#xD;
castle, whither she and her father, Decadi&#xD;
Roberts, took up quarters for about a month.&#xD;
The repugnance which Pierre felt at the&#xD;
ideii of visiting the abode of the Syren, wa~&#xD;
overcome by consideration of the afflictior&#xD;
of his beloved Cecile, who could best~ b(&#xD;
consoled by the sympathy and kindness o&#xD;
his sincere regard and affection. Tbns, lov(&#xD;
and' duty combined to lead him where h&#xD;
was obliged to meet the redoubtable Regina&#xD;
Between the mistress of the lordly halL&#xD;
and ~hcr dependent, the game-keeper,&#xD;
strange species of contest ensued dunn!&#xD;
this period.&#xD;
Deeply enamored of the handsome youn~&#xD;
man, and completely infatuated, Regin&#xD;
gave the strongest and most visible evidence&#xD;
of the state of her feelings. The warmt]&#xD;
of her manner was habitually met with th&#xD;
&#xD;
icy coldness of respect; but the steady con&#xD;
centration of the sun's rays will dissolve the&#xD;
stubborn chillness of the frozen mass. Des-&#xD;
pite, therefore, of good resolves and virtuous&#xD;
intention, backed even by sincere love for&#xD;
another,-the. respect was, on one solitary&#xD;
occasion, obliterated.&#xD;
When Cecile, on the succeeding day,&#xD;
received the customary attentions from these~&#xD;
two persons, she little suspected that the one&#xD;
was suffering the pangs of shame and re-&#xD;
morse, and that the other had added a fresh&#xD;
stain to her tarnished conscience.&#xD;
For six months, from that time, Pierre&#xD;
Aubin contrived to avoid meeting Regina&#xD;
alone, and the pure love which he bore&#xD;
for the innocent Cecile had hut . increased,&#xD;
if possible, by the, contrast of hei purity and&#xD;
virtue, which he would feign emulate.&#xD;
At last he found himself one day face to&#xD;
face with his evil genius, ~vho thus addressed&#xD;
him,-&#xD;
'Pierre, I can, I will become free. Mv&#xD;
uncle, the Lord 6f Gazeran, is about to make&#xD;
a jous'ney to Italy for, the benefit, of his&#xD;
health, atid he proposes to take me with him.&#xD;
His fortuneshould devolve upon me,-J)ut I&#xD;
am willing to renounce it-to break my pro-&#xD;
mise of celibacy. You know that I love&#xD;
you. I will no longer admit the control of&#xD;
an~~ person (save you) over my action.&#xD;
Will you marry me?'&#xD;
He regarded the determined and impas-&#xD;
sioned beauty with a mournful look of&#xD;
astonishment.&#xD;
'Will you mary me?' she repeated, ad-&#xD;
ding-&#xD;
'I will brave public opinion and reproach.&#xD;
I will sacrifice every thing for the man I so&#xD;
warmly love-but if my position should be-&#xD;
come too irksome we xviii depart hence.&#xD;
You are silent l Well, I give you two days&#xD;
E to consider what I hqve said. Mind that I&#xD;
receive your answer before the expiration of&#xD;
that time.'&#xD;
'You shall have it to-morrow,' replied&#xD;

and whilst his brothers, regardless of him,&#xD;
entered into the compact to secure the prtze~&#xD;
he cherished the wish he dared not hope to&#xD;
see. realized, and experienced the miserable&#xD;
feeling arising from consciousness of per-&#xD;
sonal deformity, a~d consequent inferiority,&#xD;
which in his breast engendered self-hatred&#xD;
and rancorous envy and malice towards all&#xD;
those who were open to love, with hopes of&#xD;
success , and he swore vengeance, sure and&#xD;
secret, on ~zny, favored rival.&#xD;
For months, had the coquettish Regina,&#xD;
who delighted in the homage of all m~n, en-&#xD;
couraged, by turns, each of the four brothers,&#xD;
without giving any decided preference to&#xD;
either.&#xD;
During this period of uncertainty, Antoine&#xD;
s~zffered the pangs of jealousy from her ca-&#xD;
pdcious indecision. Unsuspected and Un-&#xD;
~jtied, he endured the bitter feelings of hatred,&#xD;
mortification, and eniiy. He could norbrook&#xD;
L.~,idea of a favored one;. he shuddered at&#xD;
the thought; yet, at the expiration of mouths&#xD;
of vacillation, when all the brothers seemed&#xD;
likely to be rejected, by the lady of his secret&#xD;
love, Antoine was dissatisfied. The slight.to&#xD;
them he resolved to treasure up, to be re-&#xD;
venged upon whoever should happen to be&#xD;
preferred to them.&#xD;
The compact antI the courtship here spoken&#xD;
cf, it will be understood, had taken place be-&#xD;
f~re the visit, to Haut'Montel, of the brothers,&#xD;
whom we had just ushered into the, presence&#xD;
of their u~williugly-acknowledged father.&#xD;
The haughty and rebellious young men&#xD;
had come at the summons of the Major, but&#xD;
were ignorant or his motive in sending for&#xD;
them. They dared not refuse to attend, yet&#xD;
w~s 'their salutation disresjeetful and scorn-&#xD;
M; and their manner plainly showed a pre-&#xD;
determination to make no concessions to their&#xD;
rejected parent.&#xD;
,~reat was the astonishment of Pierre, the&#xD;
bid~.ien witness, pn hearing the Major address&#xD;
these young noblemen as their father, and&#xD;
~ft'er t9rehnquish his claims to the, property&#xD;
of. tl~e old .I~~Iarquis (deceased) in thei~,14vor&#xD;

~tiedne. de, Laboprdilliere also xpressec&#xD;
his willingness to retain his present incognito&#xD;
&#xD;
leaving to. his Sons their political opinions uti-&#xD;
questioned and unfettered. To do all this he&#xD;
promised, in return for their simply granting&#xD;
him the satisfaction of passing the residue of&#xD;
life in the society of his sons. Also, to let&#xD;
the past be obliterated from recollection, and&#xD;
the future be spent in such amicable terms&#xD;
as became their relationship.&#xD;
With gloomy brows, and t~tern, unmoved&#xD;
countenances, had the four young men lis-&#xD;
tened to the advances so nobly made to them.&#xD;
The dwarf, however, had manifested a dis-&#xD;
respectful irritation, which was checked&#xD;
several times by his elder brother. He now&#xD;
insolently and ironically put the query that&#xD;
the Qthers hesitated to speak,-&#xD;
'Are these your only demands for resign-&#xD;
ing your rights? ~s this, then, all you have&#xD;
to say to us?'&#xD;
'No; it is not all!' was the quiet reply.,&#xD;
'Ah! Ab!' 'exclaimed the sons,, simulta-&#xD;
neously, each hoping that some inadmissible&#xD;
proposition would give a color of justification&#xD;
to themselves for the refusal on which they&#xD;
were deterrninnd.&#xD;
'Out of ~the fortune I propose giving up to&#xD;
you,' continued the kind old man,. 'I wish&#xD;
you to set apart any sum you may see fit, as&#xD;
an allowance, in token of your favor and as&#xD;
an evidence of good will towards the indi-&#xD;
vidual, for whom I would besp~ik it. No&#xD;
matter how small the amount you may de-&#xD;
vote to this purpose, that~ is of little impor-&#xD;
tance in my sight: it is, the principle on&#xD;
which you act. My earnest desire is to se-&#xD;
cure for him your regard, your friendship.'&#xD;
~ Who is the person in question?' inquired&#xD;
William.&#xD;
'Your brother!'&#xD;
'How so? Who? What brother?' burst&#xD;
from them, in accepts of a4onishment,,&#xD;
'If lie of whom I speak has not borne my&#xD;
rt~me since the death of your mother, it was,&#xD;
my children, out of consideration to you;&#xD;
but if I have thus deprived 'him of the title&#xD;
of son, so much the more am J bound to se-&#xD;
I cure him an honorable position; an'd,, what is&#xD;
still better, and dearest to my heart, your&#xD;
united friendship. Truly, I assure you, he is&#xD;
worthy of it.'&#xD;
Again Antoine was spokesman, rudely&#xD;
saying,-&#xD;
'Does the Major believe that friendship or&#xD;
I affection is to be commanded?, and ~ilI he&#xD;
inform us who i~ the individual whom he&#xD;
&#xD;
R~INA.&#xD;

In spite of the efforts' of Etienne de La-&#xD;

hand in a threatening manner, as the .young&#xD;
man finishedd this aggravating speech.&#xD;

his lips, and exclaiming, 'Father! father!'&#xD;
sank on his knees before him.&#xD;
The Major raised the son of his loved&#xD;
Enphrosine, and bidding him sit beside him&#xD;
-as soon as they had regained composure to&#xD;
speak-~.thus addressed him&#xD;
'Had I foreseen this result, I should not&#xD;
have made you a witness of this scene. I&#xD;
expected some remonstrances, but I calculat-&#xD;
ed on ultimate success. I had, it seems, too&#xD;
good an opinion of the pupils of my *ife and&#xD;
the Marquis, my father,'&#xD;
'I hope that you will not seek another in-&#xD;

'I will not promise that.'&#xD;
'At least, I beseech you not again to so-&#xD;
licit them for friendship towards me. Am I&#xD;
not well enough provided in possessing&#xD;
yours?'&#xD;
'Yes, Pierre, you deserve alone to possess&#xD;
all my love; but shall I avow it? In spite of&#xD;
myself I feel affection for those who ungrate-&#xD;
fully spurn me from their hearts. Alas l we&#xD;
do not with impunity descend from a noble&#xD;

'It is not for me, sir, to reproach you for&#xD;

replied Pierre. DoI not see in it a guaranty&#xD;

'No doubt,' replied the Major, pressing&#xD;

of satisfaction, 'that you will never forget-&#xD;

'Add to that-and for my brothers,' so.&#xD;

Happy to have obtained this promise, the&#xD;

'That be loves her still-that he will&#xD;

'Prerre would have remonstrated, but the&#xD;

'knew it .was no use to oppose him.&#xD;
'-At. all events 1 will waft a parting' kiss&#xD;

'Ah! Well! If that will be any satis-&#xD;
faction to you, by all means do so, you fool-&#xD;

As Pierre approached the door for this&#xD;
truly lover-like~ leave-taking, it was softly&#xD;
opened, and. the pretty Cecile, in captivating&#xD;
~ttirepresented her smiling face to receive&#xD;
the adieu of her betrothed.&#xD;
'Apleasant 'journey to you, Pierre,' said&#xD;
she, 'then closed the door so quickly that, to&#xD;
hew' father, the scene was rapid as enchant~&#xD;
~knent.~~2and remarked, good-naturedly,-&#xD;
~ Ah, ~he 'gipsey. She has not been to&#xD;
bed at all, it seems.'&#xD;
Full of joyful~ anticipations for the future,&#xD;
the'~game-keeper set out for Paris.&#xD;
- The Major dismissed' his sole attendant,&#xD;
't'he"old 'house-keeper, who was the mother&#xD;
of Petit Ghauvil-and was busy all that&#xD;
~diIy (dii which Piar*e was journeying to th9&#xD;
'Metropolis) 'preparing to quit Haut-Montel.&#xD;
When evening came he set out to~inake one&#xD;
'inorey experiment oil the feelings ~ his&#xD;
qons.'&#xD;
&#xD;
it was supper-time at the castle of Valga-&#xD;
*st, and the five grandsons of the. dec~sed&#xD;
'Marquis were seated around a sumptuous&#xD;
'table, when the bell of the great gate re&#xD;
sounded through the halls. Bartholomew,&#xD;
the old servitor, already mentioned as so&#xD;
'unscrupulonsly devoted to the family honor&#xD;
it was, who opened to the unusually lat"&#xD;
summons. 'He was so surprised at sight&#xD;
of the visitor that he hesitated, in confusion,&#xD;
whether to aimit him or not.&#xD;
Taking advantage of thi's perplexity, th~e&#xD;
Major brushed hastily past the porter, crossed&#xD;
the court called the Court of honor, rapidly&#xD;
ascended the stairs and entered the dining&#xD;
hall unannouncedd.&#xD;
On beholding their father, the assembled&#xD;
children shuddered, and simultaneously arose&#xD;
-but not, alas! out of respect.&#xD;
'For what purpose came you here, sir!'&#xD;
inquire l Antoine.&#xD;
'1 come to dWell amicably with you, my&#xD;
sons,' calmly replied Etienne de 'Labourdil-&#xD;
here.&#xD;
'Make room for me at this table where I&#xD;
have a right to sit, and be pleased to resume&#xD;
~your 'places, gentlemen. I wish rite family&#xD;
to be complete, and henceforth it will be so&#xD;
since I, its chief, 'am added to you all.'&#xD;
To this the' eldest son replied :-~~&#xD;
'Take the place wftich belongs to you,&#xD;
sir, at this table-we cannot oppose you.&#xD;
Command at Valgenest. It is your right.&#xD;
We shall respect your rights. But you. can-&#xD;
not force us to live under the same root&#xD;
with you.. The day on which you enter&#xD;
here is the day on which we feave.'&#xD;
The five brothers then threw their nap~&#xD;
kins on the table, took their hats, and silently&#xD;
walked out of the dining-hall.&#xD;
The Major was' not prepared for this sud-&#xD;
den revolution; he was disturbed, agitated,&#xD;
'and for some time.knew not what to do.&#xD;
- We will now revert to 'the game.keepei'.&#xD;
When Pierre Aubin, on~ hi~ return from&#xD;
his journey to Paris, learned from' Mother&#xD;
Chauvel the departure of the Major from&#xD;
Haut~Mentel, he' supposed that it was at&#xD;
I Valganest he should meet the Major,"as no&#xD;

To 'Valganest, therefore,,.Pierre went, and&#xD;
it happened that old' Bartholomew was the&#xD;

closed on Pierre.                          No more, f~r the present, was beard of&#xD;
His hopes dashed to pieces, and a prey to the Major. The old lady returned to Pajis,&#xD;

mysterious disappearance of the Major, the event was preceded by the; receipt oE. a&#xD;
young miln rett~rned to his mother to relate threatening letter which Pierre Aubin found&#xD;
the ill success. She, too, at first feared 'that on hi'~ pillow. The. contents left no doubt&#xD;
those who had so much interest in getting as to who was the author of it.&#xD;

W~te' the christening of the first-born of&#xD;
Oeile.             -&#xD;
The question, uow will probably arise.&#xD;
Where~ during this time, was Major 'Seigne-&#xD;
wiles? He was a prisoner in the castle of&#xD;
Vaiganest&#xD;
the    CHAPThR     VI.&#xD;
castle of Valganest the Major&#xD;
p~~sed many niotiths, in conformity with a&#xD;
eoiupact he had made with his disdainful&#xD;
seas. Unwilling to resign the casfle.'home,&#xD;
fheir rank and tbrtune, by really carrying&#xD;
out4he, scornful resolve they had expressed&#xD;
on quitting the supper-table, they had suffered&#xD;
themselves to be induced to remain.-pro-&#xD;
vided that their father would agree to con-&#xD;
ceal himself,' and not let it be known that he&#xD;
was alive and a resideizt beneath his own&#xD;
t'eof.&#xD;
Not as a.master or guest did Etienne de&#xD;
Labourdilliere take up his abode at Valga-&#xD;
nest, his lawful inheritance-but as a self-&#xD;
immured'prisoner!&#xD;
* To ~these - strange conditions the Major&#xD;
consented, in .the hope of ultimately obtain-&#xD;
ing~a~ portion of the affection of hjs. sons.&#xD;
Fancying that his captivity was a laudable&#xD;
uwetl as voluntary ~acriflce to them, he&#xD;
'was satisfied'with being thus tolerated. The&#xD;
~nly thing that the old man c~rtld not bear&#xD;
patiently was, being compelled to forego all&#xD;
Iw~erconrse with Pierre, Decadi, etc.~ at&#xD;
-Brasseuse,' and as latterly happened) being&#xD;
~4ebarred all knowledge of their welfare.&#xD;
This yearning towards his only affection-&#xD;
ate child became more intense, ~nd, after a&#xD;
time, almost unbearable, as from a lofty tur-&#xD;
Tht~ which overlooked t~e surrounding coun-&#xD;
try for miles; 'he witnessed, wlth pain and&#xD;
~a4asm, the frequent ineendiary~fire5 which,&#xD;
lat this~ period, devastated the land,-spr~ading&#xD;
terror, ruin, and digtruction, far nd n~r.&#xD;
The flat~roofed turet, ~to which we bate&#xD;
~aIIaded, was the only promenade per~nitted&#xD;

&#xD;
who might be depended on as unwilling to&#xD;
connive at the Major's' escape, should he be&#xD;
'weary of his solitude and long again to mix&#xD;
in the worl4-or simply sigh to regain free-&#xD;
dom.&#xD;
Now on this side, and then on the other,&#xD;
would the frequently occurring and appalling&#xD;
ccapflagrations arise. The merciless flames&#xD;
spared neither rich or poor, levelling all dis-&#xD;
tinctions, as, in turn the miserable hovel of&#xD;
the peasant, or the stately baronical halt,&#xD;
was marked by an unseen hand, for destruc-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Isolated and far apart as were most of&#xD;
these' habitations, mysteriously doomed' to&#xD;
be consumed without ii~krning, and in the&#xD;
lead df the night-many of the confl~igra-&#xD;
lions were attended with an awful loss of&#xD;
life, and the victims were born to their last&#xD;
resting place amid large concourse of the&#xD;
panic-stricken inhabitants of the district,&#xD;
who quailed at the thought-' Who will be&#xD;
the next to suffer ?'&#xD;
As these melancholy funeral processions&#xD;
passed within sight, the lonely watcher on&#xD;
the tower would kneel down and pray that&#xD;
the inhabitants of the game-keeper of Bras-&#xD;
seuse might be spared!&#xD;
It becam~ noted that the dread visitation&#xD;
vvl~ich had in more or less degree, afThcted&#xD;
all else, within many leagues, had but one&#xD;
total exception. This being the Castle of&#xD;
Val~anest, whose occupants, the five bro-&#xD;
thers, were far from being.. in good qdor&#xD;
with theIr neighbors-all manner of sur-&#xD;
mises and ill-natured remarks were, in con~&#xD;
sequence, freely circulated.&#xD;
This rather remarkable exemption was&#xD;
about to cease in an appalling manner-bnt,&#xD;
meanwhile, an incident of equally awful&#xD;
airport( claims our attention.&#xD;
'Late in the still night, as the Major was&#xD;
quietly pacing his lQnely round,.on the tur-&#xD;
ret, (his vigdanr eye caught sight' of' the&#xD;
terror-boding ~mnoke ascending high o'er the&#xD;
~wood of Brasseuse. 'His alarm was intense;&#xD;
and thus hespoke his thoughts aloud.&#xD;
'My worst fears are realized! lzlis turn&#xD;
has, ~rt1iesgth, come! Oh I Pierre, my son!&#xD;
Would that-I could aid or save you! And&#xD;
ye ruthless 9nes-ye will give me no intelli-&#xD;
gence of his fate. Ye accord' me not your&#xD;
'love,'a9d but rarely your society even, and&#xD;
for this have I relinquished kim and all that&#xD;
man holds dear !~&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Bitter must have been the reflections t&#xD;
that solitary being at the time of' the&#xD;
~posed peril to Pierre Aubin.&#xD;
It was, however, the neighboring house&#xD;
and barns of La Grange farm which wer&#xD;
then burning, though he knew it not; fo&#xD;
that time the game-keeper's dwelling wa&#xD;
safe-Yet i was not spared from motivO&#xD;
of' mercy, but in furtherance of a plot in&#xD;
evolving the destruction of Pierre's' gooi&#xD;
name, he being missing-unaccountably t4&#xD;
his neighbors,-thongh the reader is awar4&#xD;
that he was the occupant of a dungeon&#xD;
whither his abductors had conveyed him&#xD;
from the scene of festivity which was inter&#xD;
rupred by the .treaeherous scxeech-owl sig&#xD;
nal.&#xD;
To return to the Major.-He could bea'&#xD;
the' torturing uncertainty no longer. At a!&#xD;
hazards to himself he m'.ist inquire the fat&#xD;
of his son, Pierre. From his pocket-boot&#xD;
he tears a leaf, writes a few 'lines on it,' re&#xD;
questing, the finder, whoelrer he 'may be,-&#xD;
if Pierre Aubin be living, to pass down th(&#xD;
avenue in front of the castle, and cut&#xD;
branch from a sapling on the rigkt lnanc&#xD;
sidc-~f dead,.to break off one. on the lefL&#xD;
'this writing the anxious prisoner wrap'&#xD;
ped around two 'pieces of gold, ~mnd tyin~&#xD;
them' in the cornerof his handkerchief,'hi&#xD;
twirled thi9 with the motion of a sling, and&#xD;
thus launched the'missive in the air.&#xD;
Away flew the cloth and its enclosure&#xD;
beyond the bounds of the imprisoning&#xD;
walls.&#xD;
Alas, for Etienne do LabourdilIier~, these&#xD;
articles were picked up, the next morning,&#xD;
by Bartholomew, who handed them to his&#xD;
young lords.&#xD;
In a body these~ five men repaired to' the&#xD;
turret, where the despised parent was on the&#xD;
look-out for some one 'tO come along and&#xD;
make known whether anything'f'atal had hap-&#xD;
pened to Pierre- 'i'hey upbraided thefl"pri-&#xD;
sorter' for this infringement of his contract,&#xD;
feigning to believe he had some ded~er, mo-&#xD;
tive than appeared, and was ~desiroiis of&#xD;
compromising them and freeing himself.&#xD;
This the o14 man denied, and he besought&#xD;
them to give him the satisfaction of know-&#xD;
ing the result of the last fire, and the tide of&#xD;
Pierre. This~ they, inhumanly, would not&#xD;
do, but left their father in' an ag~n~r of sus-&#xD;
pense.&#xD;
After this interview~ a' consultation w~s&#xD;
&#xD;
held between the brothers, as to what c~u~i~&#xD;
they should pursue. '&#xD;
'Oar common ir~terest~ requires that ~t~M&#xD;
's should not oecutr again,' said F'raneois,'th&amp;amp;&#xD;

What, then,' would have b~en said if that&#xD;

r 'Perhaps we are suspected of this already!&#xD;
I Believe me, our first resolve is best.'&#xD;
~ F'rancois, who thus" spoke, was, front his&#xD;
superior, mental, and personal qualifieati'oi~s,&#xD;
- the ruling head of the house of LabourJi~-&#xD;
- here. '&#xD;
'Undoubtedly, you are i'ight!' bo1di~&#xD;
replied the dwarf, Antoine.&#xD;
I The other three murmured ~ hesit~tVdg&#xD;
consent to that which had previously ':beehi&#xD;
* suggested, but it was with trepidation anil.&#xD;
lingering reluctance. To put an' end to 'th~&#xD;

I in a decided tone,~-'-- "&#xD;
'Let it be done. I take it-upon mys~1f."'&#xD;
'lie .it so!' re~ilied the rest.&#xD;
The dwarf then dragged a large 'cakeil&#xD;
chest, from ~ corner, Into the middle of 'the&#xD;
room, examined it, measuring it signiflcantl$i~&#xD;
and amongst them they carried it up stairs-.&#xD;
Depositing the ominous load; where it~Whs&#xD;
hidden by - the bed-curtains, the br6thei'~-&#xD;
descended, leaving the door of the Maj6r'A&#xD;
room open behind 'th~m.&#xD;

The brothers, below, listened intently.ro&#xD;
tli~, ~teps ~f these two men approaching,&#xD;
opposite qitarters, the appointed place&#xD;
ofthe death which one was carrying to the&#xD;
other.&#xD;
It was a. moment of interest and excite-&#xD;

the door-now coine&amp;amp; - the moment of con-&#xD;

Eonore could say no more;, WillianT and&#xD;
Jarne9 trembled and turned pale..&#xD;
One, only, of the brothers retained his&#xD;
ferQeious spirit unrtdngled with pity or re-&#xD;
morse. This was Antoine, the fiendish&#xD;
~4wj~rf. He-fearing lest the others~ might&#xD;
relent, should they hear their fathers voice&#xD;
entreating help-took down ~ hunting horn&#xD;
t~pm the wall, and blew a blast so long, so&#xD;
loud, and fearful, that it soumled, under t~ie&#xD;
4~rea~l excitement of the moment, like some&#xD;
u4earthly demon-yell.&#xD;
A pause in the horrid din, and a scuffle&#xD;
was heard overhead-~-then a shriek-and, all&#xD;
wa~ silent as the grava l&#xD;
Presently a whistle was heard on the&#xD;
stairs, The twins arose~ but could l~ardly&#xD;

nard on me-but it is only a trifling scratch.&#xD;
Nothing now is to be don&amp;amp;-.save to burn&#xD;
myclothes, andwash away the stains from&#xD;
the boards. All then is safe!'&#xD;
'Dat what are we to do with~ that-that&#xD;
chest V asked ~Honore, with? averted gaze,&#xD;
pointing to it.&#xD;
'Never mind, I will see to it,' 'replied&#xD;
Francois; 'I will dispose of' that myself.'&#xD;
From this fearful scene we must revert&#xD;
again to Regina. When, pressed by the&#xD;
brothers to select one of them as her future&#xD;
husband, she had told them"that she would&#xD;
be the wife of no man until she had been&#xD;
avenged on Pierre Aubin, whom, she alleged,&#xD;
had insulted her with his base love.&#xD;
This they readily undertook to do, and we&#xD;
have seen how they got him in their power,&#xD;
and conveyed him (as hey thought) to a&#xD;
living tomb in the vaults ~ Gazeran castle.&#xD;
Glad were they to find it was C man whom&#xD;
they previously hated, that ~va~ o he the&#xD;
victim of' this wori~ijm's revenge.&#xD;
Besieged, by suitors, and loving only&#xD;
Pierre, Re~iha, to be rid of importunity,&#xD;
agreed,' e e long, to become the wife of&#xD;
Francois de Labourdilliere. The brothers&#xD;
being satisfied that the coveted property of&#xD;
Gazeran' would thus come into the family,&#xD;
the three unsuccessfi~tl wooers withdrew their&#xD;
pretensions with a good grace, and renewed&#xD;
their vow-that their paterna~.feeIings should&#xD;
remain undisturbed by this preference.&#xD;
Antoine, alone, was free to act. He had&#xD;
not entered the lists as competitor for the&#xD;
lady's favor, therefore he took no part in the&#xD;
renewal of the brother's compact. Yet, he&#xD;
was resolved, if possible, t  prevent 'the&#xD;
nrntch, which, however, it will shortly ap..&#xD;
pea'~, was fearfully obstructed.&#xD;
It was a festival at Yalganest, a grand en-&#xD;
telileOt given to celebrate the bet'ro~haI&#xD;
of Fraf1co1s~ and Regina. All the aristocracy&#xD;
of the neighlio'rhood was assembled and&#xD;
amongst the brilliant array-none were t~iore&#xD;
h~utiful and magnificent in looks ~nd di~ess&#xD;
thanRegin~-noii~ appeared happier than&#xD;

The midst of the mirth n~isic and ~pleridor&#xD;
&#xD;
________                  kT~oiNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
~O1' the party, he, Francdis, the most guilty,&#xD;
seemed unconcerned. flis head was eree*,&#xD;
a ready smile played on his lip~, and his&#xD;
heart seemed at ease.&#xD;
We will pass over the ball and supper&#xD;
without description, to narrate the startling&#xD;
event that shortly after occurred to disturb&#xD;
the, scene of joyous festivity.&#xD;
Suddenly arose the alarming cry of fire!&#xD;
High above the gay music of the baud&#xD;
sounded the words-fire! fire! On the&#xD;
instant of alarm, as the guests hurried to the&#xD;
windows, was to be seen, the ancient pavi-&#xD;
lion, at the end of the path, glowing in a&#xD;
brilliant blaze-the flames already bursting&#xD;
through the roof.&#xD;
'Cahn yourselves, ladies and gen~tleinen,&#xD;
,there is nothing to be feared! Let it burn!&#xD;
said Antoine; 'It is only a miserable stru&amp;amp;-&#xD;
tare which the fire will save us the trouble&#xD;
of pulling down. It only wanted"a bo~n-ffrr~&#xD;
to complete the rejoicing, and the incendi-&#xD;
aries have taken on themselves this addition&#xD;
to surprise us.'&#xD;
l~he panic of the company ceased on&#xD;
this remark, the brothers inwardry applauded&#xD;
the presence of mind of the dwarf, and they&#xD;
also said-' Let it burns'&#xD;
The sight of the burning pavilion dis-&#xD;
pelled the gloom that oppressed some of the&#xD;
sons of the Major, and a weight was instantly&#xD;
removed from' their guilty' minds. They&#xD;
blessed the hand from whence the kindling&#xD;
spark proceeded-for within that blazing&#xD;
pile lay the coffin-chest, which how they&#xD;
thought wouki be effectually disposed of-&#xD;
'But the alarm had spread amongst the ser-&#xD;
vants~ and Vetainers of the' gitests. The&#xD;
cOmmands of the lordly brothers, to let' the&#xD;
building be consumed, had notreached their'&#xD;
ears, and in a body they had ,gone to endea-&#xD;
vor to1 put out the tIre.&#xD;
The great bell of-the castle was loudly&#xD;
tolling, and in aC incredibly short time&#xD;
people rushed f:rom all quarters to thd ooi..&#xD;
flagrationd In vain did the brothers 'call to&#xD;
the men, from the balconies, to stop and, let&#xD;
it burn. The str~ngeorders were&#xD;
or unheeded.                ,    unheard&#xD;
Now, indeed, in their tu~n we#~ the wick-&#xD;
ed 'men troubled and afraid. Their f&amp;amp;r u4as&#xD;
worse than that whi6h 'ha'd, 'at fiat, 'been&#xD;
in~mentarily .experienced by the company. I&#xD;

old-fashioned lumber and family ~urio~iti~s-&#xD;
did not ~seem worth the risk, to life' aft~1&#xD;
,limb, of the busy hard-working crowd.&#xD;
The pavilion was totally' ruveloped in&#xD;
flames when the owners arrived, but '~li~r&#xD;
rushed into it as precipitately as if it con-&#xD;
tained something veryt precioCs wh~cli ~&#xD;
were anxious to save. As they reached Abe&#xD;
interior, two stout foot-men were~ trying ~&#xD;
~oroe open the lid of a large chest, ap~it-&#xD;
rently too heavy for them to carry out, in&#xD;
or'ler to get at the opposeded valuable con-&#xD;
tents.&#xD;
'Leave it, I command you%' cried Wiltiajit&#xD;
in a thundering tone, and he repulsed'tii~&#xD;
men ir'i so violent t manner, that,;in 8Qi~pr~se&#xD;
and terror they sprung' back beyond the&#xD;
'Let that alone!' simultaneously e~j-&#xD;
claimed lames, Honore and Antoinuili&#xD;
seeming most 'violently agitated.&#xD;
Francois was the last to reach 'the ~o*.&#xD;
lie forced his way through 'the crowd~'and&#xD;

kVon ~haring the calamity of the country-~&#xD;
wrecked by the mysterious fires of ruthless&#xD;
incendiaries-and caused many to regret&#xD;
their hard thoughts and sai~castie words: for&#xD;
.~hich they sought to atone by. repairing to&#xD;
,the Castle of Valganest to testify respect and&#xD;
condolence.&#xD;
On the occasion  f these frequent~ disasters,&#xD;
Ru distinctions Qf wealth or rank, etc., Were&#xD;
for the time submerged; and whether cabin&#xD;
or castle had met its ~loom, sympathy was ex-&#xD;
tended by the general community to the sur-&#xD;
viving sufferers: and in cases of loss of life&#xD;
the obsequies were attended by a large con-&#xD;
course of the inhabitants.&#xD;
When the last offices were performed over&#xD;
tIle departed, the mass returned to the dwell-&#xD;
which had been victimized; or, if the,&#xD;
devastation had been complete, to the ruins,-&#xD;
where, under the canopy of Heaven, they&#xD;
w911h1 spend the rest of tl~e day in drinking&#xD;
to the death of the murderous incendiaries.&#xD;
It sometimes happened, though, tfrat these&#xD;
barbarous c~rousals were interrupted by the&#xD;
tocaln's sound, or the sudden blaze of a new&#xD;
coz4lagration.&#xD;
The most favored of the victims, of the&#xD;
unknown band of depredators, suffered only&#xD;
~n their possessions-their stocks of hay or&#xD;
corn,1 their barns or out-houses, being destroy-&#xD;
ed by the fiery scourge. But if these disas-&#xD;
ters were less fatal, they were numerous, and&#xD;
seryed to keep up the general and continued&#xD;
terrorr and alarm.&#xD;
As the place of a murder i~ marked (in&#xD;
I~OmaII catholic countries) by a cross,~o per-&#xD;
petuate the remembrance of' the deed, and&#xD;
suggest pious reflections and prayers,, on the&#xD;
spot where it ot~curred-so was it resolved,&#xD;
Lllat a monumental tomb to the unfortunate&#xD;
~'rancoie' should be erected over the place&#xD;
where he perished,&#xD;
Accordingly the ruins of the pavilion were&#xD;
clearedd away, and a nei~ hunial..vault con-&#xD;
on its site, under' th9 intmedi~te&#xD;
~st4tetvisi6n of ~he brothers:&#xD;
"During'thistiine they took i$ by turns to&#xD;
watch (with'ihe relay of priests) beside' the&#xD;

in, presence of 1his victim,, just as they dread-,&#xD;

they, hardly less guilty than the deceased,&#xD;
had constructeil, and actually connived at.&#xD;
For two days had the body thus lain in&#xD;
well-guarded 'state; and the e~remplary per-&#xD;
formance of this fraternal duty with the ap-&#xD;
pearance of affliction and tender solicitude&#xD;
which the aristocrats displayed -(though in&#xD;
reality Antoine was callous to all good feeling)&#xD;
contributed not a little' raise the ill-liked&#xD;
fraternity in public estimation.&#xD;
It had not been credited that they were&#xD;
capable ef real attachment even to each&#xD;
other.&#xD;
The great entrance to Valganest was open&#xD;
to all comers: 'for any one was free, for the&#xD;
time, tO enter there withoutt ceremony. Su&#xD;
it happened that no notice was taken of a&#xD;
certain person, who came for a veyy different&#xD;
purpose than to evince respect fhr the dead.&#xD;
This person was evidently a stranger to&#xD;
the castle: for he had no little difficulty in&#xD;
making out the way to the chamber which&#xD;
he sought. However, he seemed at length&#xD;
to have found the right place, for he halted&#xD;
at a door, on which he knocked, in a very pee.&#xD;
culiar manner, three several times.&#xD;
Antoine, the occupant of the' room, had&#xD;
just been released from watch over the re-&#xD;
~mains of his brother, and had disposed him..&#xD;
self for sleep, when his acute earuetected the&#xD;
raps which were 'so ,timidly or cautiously&#xD;
made. He raised his head, rubbed his eyes,&#xD;
looked wildly around, and in'uttered,-&#xD;
'It caujiot be possible!'&#xD;
The man who stood in the corridor, listen-&#xD;
ing attentively for some sound within the&#xD;
room, having heard the slight noise made by&#xD;
Antoine, repeated not the rapping, but&#xD;
scratched four~ separate times (with a mea-&#xD;
sured pause between each) on a panel of the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
'It must be so! It is one of them!' ex-&#xD;
claimed the dwarf, half aloud; and greatly&#xD;
an~~yed, it' lint also, alarmed, jie hastily quit-&#xD;
ted the bed on which he had flnng himself for&#xD;
a brief repose, ,a~td opened the door.&#xD;
The stranger who met his view was a man&#xD;
of imposing height. and fine proportions. He&#xD;
was dressed in the long blue surtout, with&#xD;
black collars that denojad the half-pay officer&#xD;
of that Feriod. A smallpiece of red~ribbon&#xD;
'decorated a button-hole of his coat; he wa~&#xD;
booted, spurred,'~and traVel-stained.&#xD;
&#xD;
*1&#xD;
&#xD;
RJ~INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
Antoine most probably expected to hat&#xD;
seen some one else, for he appeared ove:&#xD;
come with astonishment; and not until di&#xD;
new-coiner had closed the door and seate&#xD;
himself, did he recover the power of &amp;amp;peecl&#xD;
Then mastering his agitation, he hurriadl&#xD;
and imperatively put these questions to ih&#xD;
unknown&#xD;
'Who are you?' Whence cameyou?-&#xD;
What do you want 'P&#xD;
With a' waive of the hand, expressive c&#xD;
the necessity for composure, the strange&#xD;
whispered his interrogative reply,-&#xD;
'Can we converse here safely 'P&#xD;
'Converse, say you? First have the good&#xD;
ness to tell me who you are, and from whon&#xD;
you come?' replied Antoine.&#xD;
'I come on my ewn account. As . to whi&#xD;
I am, ypu shall presently be informed o&#xD;
that.' \,&#xD;
Thus speaking, the strange intruder, open&#xD;
ing a memorandum-book, took out of it&#xD;
*&amp;amp; playing-card-it was the ace of spades-pre&#xD;
sending it to Antoine, he inquired,-&#xD;
'Do you know that, Mr. Mathien?'&#xD;
This name, which we have used for thc&#xD;
first time, to the unworthy hprig of a noblc&#xD;
t~ree, did not appear to cause any surprise tC&#xD;
the person thus addressed. He glanced al&#xD;
the card, and an expression of ~mistrust writ&#xD;
legible on his ill-favored features.&#xD;
As if to remove all doubt and suspicion,&#xD;
the handsome, visitor held up the card be-&#xD;
tween him and the light. Immediately it be-&#xD;
came plain that'the figure on the card was&#xD;
perforated 'by pin-holes, at the angles, the&#xD;
rays of light penetrating through the minute&#xD;
orifices, rendering ~these marks visible.&#xD;
'Now, then, perhaps Mr. Mathien can&#xD;
guess who I am!' coolly remarks the un-&#xD;
welcome guest.&#xD;
'You are one sent to me to settle some old&#xD;
accounts. Tell me the figures and I will set&#xD;
them down,' cunning replied the dwarf,,thus&#xD;
pointing out tFie part.for the stranger to act&#xD;
in case any one should disturb their inter-'&#xD;
view.&#xD;
'Very well; that will explain, without&#xD;
risk, that which ought not to be 'overheard&#xD;
by any 'listener at the door, 'if such should be&#xD;
there.'&#xD;
Antoine then took paper iind pens from. a.&#xD;
desk and wrote down figures at tbe other's&#xD;
dictation, until the whqle sjde, of a ~sheet&#xD;
was filled with these symbolical cyphers;&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
~e When the visitor had concluded, Antbjife&#xD;
r~ opened a large" 'doset beyond' ' the. aJ6c~&#xD;

~might have kept this in their own chamber&#xD;
where there is plenty of room, instetid Qt&#xD;

r Despite his visible repugnance to ent~r th~&#xD;
closet, it was necessary to do so in order to&#xD;
get rid of his visitor.&#xD;

silently presented them to the mysterious&#xD;
stranger, who received the money with a p0-&#xD;

changing another word.&#xD;

in no very pleasant mood, to lodk over&#xD;

This is quite natural when we consider&#xD;
how well qualified was Decadi Robert for&#xD;
the station of head of this division of. riigAt&#xD;
police, to which post the public voi6e had&#xD;
called him, and which the authorities dl' the&#xD;
district had duly sanctioned.&#xD;
1i~he old soldier was in his ehrnenLt, and&#xD;
had ample employment in drilling hs~ raw&#xD;

the ~recauhons against danger, and, regulat-&#xD;

one knew who might not be the one&#xD;
to betray the Wijtch-word and the secret&#xD;

'The 'Grange' had bean burned to the&#xD;
ground before the company, under the cos~i-&#xD;
~niand of bur friend Decadi Robert, had&#xD;
* btien Ibruied. But, notwithstanding its prox-.&#xD;
unity, the ganie-keeper's house had escaped~&#xD;
Here, therefore, it was that the old soldier&#xD;
of' the consulate established his hend~~ar~&#xD;
"hither, during the day, came the&#xD;
iuIi~l.iitants of the country, in' detachments,&#xD;
to receive his orders for the ensuing' night.'&#xD;
The house of Pierre Aubin, Which, on.&#xD;
the occasion of the baptism of Philiberte,&#xD;
was so resplendent with light, and so full of&#xD;
jojt~ussound, was silent' and dismal as the&#xD;
grave. One little lamp ajone sent its feeble&#xD;
rays 'through the small' window. By 'the&#xD;
flu~keritrg blaze, of the embers expiring oil&#xD;
'th~ hearth, sat a half-clad care-worn 'lodlting&#xD;
'her hair was in disorder, her face' wan~&#xD;
b'~i~.eyes .haggard. No intelligefl~ceAVas' 'in&#xD;
'thb~e'~up~ and -the 'words which she occ~&#xD;
&#xD;
sionally chanted, in vain effort at a 'song~&#xD;
~ vague a'd unconnected l By her side&#xD;
was a vacant cradle, yet the poor mother&#xD;
rocked it, with a sorry smile, as if the object&#xD;
of bet" affections were really there in tran-&#xD;
quil sleep!&#xD;
This 'idiotic woman was the once gay,&#xD;
intelligent and lovely Cecile!'. This sad&#xD;
wreck was the work of that fearful disap-&#xD;
pearance of her husband, Pierre Aubin,&#xD;
related in the first chapter of our tale.&#xD;
Poor Cecile had not been in her senses&#xD;
since that memorable fete. Philiberte, the&#xD;
,little babe, was. sent to nurse, and during the&#xD;
day the mother of the unconscious innocent&#xD;
would pass her time with it at the nurse's&#xD;
cottage, but every evening at nightfall she&#xD;
would return home'to see if Pietre had come&#xD;
back. When the unfortunate woman found&#xD;
him not, these same words were used : A&#xD;
'I must wait up for my dear Pierre!'&#xD;
Nothing would induce her to go to bed..-&#xD;
She would place herself in a chair beside the&#xD;
vacant .cradle-which it would seem she&#xD;
imagined to contain her darling girl-.and&#xD;
sing to its fancied occupant, until, overcome&#xD;
with weariness, she dropt asleep.&#xD;
The kind-~earted neighbors, who had loved&#xD;
her from tier infancy, took it by turns to&#xD;
watch for thi&amp;amp; moment of oblivion of her&#xD;
sorrows, and seized the opportunity to carry&#xD;
her gently and place her quietly in her own&#xD;
bed, where every morning she would find&#xD;
herself, without question or surprise.&#xD;
Sometime, however, it happened, in con-&#xD;
sequence of the confusionn and dread' that&#xD;
reigned around, that the poor harmlessmaniac&#xD;
was~ neglected by these generous women;&#xD;
but this, it must be said, was a rare thing.&#xD;
This night she was thus unwatched; andy&#xD;
as we have said, it was indeed a dark and&#xD;
dreary night.&#xD;
In the otter.rooifl was but one individual,&#xD;
the only sentinel at hedd-quarters. It was&#xD;
our old acquaintance, Nicholas 'Godard, the&#xD;
plough-boy' and jester, whom neither past ex-&#xD;
perience or present danger had cured of 'his&#xD;
facetious' pranks and love of joking.&#xD;
The present occupation of Nicholas, how-&#xD;
ever, seern~d to 'be anything but of an agree-&#xD;
able or funny nature. A pitch-fork was in&#xD;
his banwla h~tavy axe lay on the floor within&#xD;
his ~reach,' a~ sword was strapped to his side,&#xD;
and a gun, which he seemed to he etrrnesih&#xD;
conteniplitting, rested against the tvall.")J&#xD;
&#xD;
REGINA&#xD;
&#xD;
Courage, as we have already seen, was not&#xD;
the distinguishing characteristic of this rti~tjc,&#xD;
and this formidable equipment was not enough&#xD;
to put him at ease; yet, to wile away the&#xD;
time, keep up appearances, and re-assure him-&#xD;
self, as best he might. Nicholas kept whistling&#xD;
the same tune over and over without cessa-&#xD;
tionsave the interruption of a few tremendous&#xD;
yawns and grunts.&#xD;
Suddenly this hero hears a rap at the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
Wlto-who-who-goes there?' with fal-&#xD;
tering voice he faintly murmured, and takes&#xD;
refuge beside the gun, presenting his pitch-&#xD;
fork.&#xD;
'It is only I, you fool, you! It is Jacijues&#xD;
Chanul'&#xD;
As soon as Nicholas knew who it was, he&#xD;
put on a bold kihk, brandished his fork and&#xD;
opened the door to the peasant.&#xD;
'I believe I frightened you, not a little,' said&#xD;
Jacques.&#xD;
'That is a good joke! frightened nm, in-&#xD;
deed! Say rather how well I acted the part&#xD;
of a brave soldier.'&#xD;
'To admirationT truly!' was the mocking&#xD;
assent.&#xD;
Did 1 not speak out boldly and gruffly. I&#xD;
can assure you tl4at I am' txo chicken-hearted&#xD;
fellow to be so easily scared. You must&#xD;
have heard my formidable challenge, 'Who&#xD;
goes there ?'&#xD;
'Certainly; having uncommonly sharp&#xD;
ears, I confess that I did hear those warlike&#xD;
words.'&#xD;
'How strangely you -talk, man! Why, I&#xD;
tell you if~ the whole band of the incendiaries&#xD;
were to come here and attack me, I would&#xD;
not give way one inch.'&#xD;
'That is perfectly true, Nicholas: for 'of&#xD;
course your back would be resting against&#xD;
the wall. You would not retreat. You would&#xD;
hold your ground, or your wall would hold&#xD;
you. It is all the smime."'&#xD;
Nicholas, finding it impossible to remove&#xD;
the impression of cowardice which the newly-&#xD;
arrived evidently ascribed to him,' was very&#xD;
much vexed-for Jacques lived at Fleudnes,&#xD;
not at Brasseuse, and the tale would spread-&#xD;
but, without debating the point, changed the&#xD;
subject, by saying,-&#xD;
'Has anything new occurred,' that you have&#xD;
come here to-hight?'&#xD;
'No.' I had a load to take to Brasseuse,&#xD;
so I thought I would just come over here and&#xD;
&#xD;
see the crazy woman. What is she like? ~1&#xD;
have never seen a mania '&#xD;
This was said with a cu4ning leer and an&#xD;
affectation of simplicity.&#xD;
Nicholas Godard shrugged his shoulder,&#xD;
put on an air ef superiority, and giving a&#xD;
sound~ slap on his visitor's back, replied,-&#xD;
'You have never seen a crazy 'body,&#xD;
Chanu, and don't know what a madman is&#xD;
like? Why you are a regular know-nothing&#xD;
A maniac-woman is only one whohas lost&#xD;
her sefises; nothing else is wanting, 'unless&#xD;
'she has lost something besides. Your degiv~e&#xD;
to gain knowledge I admire; good, now ydu&#xD;
t~trO satisfied. My description of what it is&#xD;
will have to content you; if not, so much the&#xD;
worse. I shall not let you see her, because&#xD;
father Decadi Robert has ordered me not,&#xD;
and I must obey orders, especially as- he is&#xD;
such a savage, violent man.'&#xD;
'Plague take the old wretch, with his night-.&#xD;
watches and patrols, which he has brought&#xD;
into fashion,' said Chanu, apparently satisfied&#xD;
with'the lucid explanation given by Nicholas.&#xD;
"I won't' say but walking about all night&#xD;
with lanterns,' he continued, 'is a good'thing&#xD;
'to terrify the villains who' are ruining the&#xD;
country with their fires; but since'we~ are 'to&#xD;
have all this labor, I think the Major 'ought&#xD;
to pay the cost.'&#xD;
'But,' rejoined Nicholas, 'we must all jdih&#xD;
in this soldier-work: for' it is all of us who&#xD;
are being burned 'out of house and home,&#xD;
and cattle, and everything; and besides that,&#xD;
some people already, you know, have lost&#xD;
their lives, too.'&#xD;
'Why, then, are not these villains ariest..&#xD;
ed; and an end 'put to the business, so that&#xD;
we might sleep at peace.'&#xD;
'You think that can be done all' at once,&#xD;
you blockhead?'&#xD;
"No, I know better than that. It is no~ to&#xD;
be done quickly. But I 'know the reaSon&#xD;
why no one has been caught,' said Jacques&#xD;
Chanu, with a knowing wink.&#xD;
'Well, then, if you are so cute dnd know&#xD;
more than other folks, just tell me why' it 'is&#xD;
so.'&#xD;
"I am sure any one might guess; it ~s for&#xD;
a very good reason: Because it is ~tot c~a*?-&#xD;
ed tkat they should be caught; Tke-'~4'~.&#xD;

'Not I, indeed,' replied the peasant of&#xD;
Fleurines. I am not the' fool. You say no&#xD;

?eople may. pretend not to see who is con-&#xD;

called me a fool: besides, that haM customer,&#xD;
I~ecadi, might ruin me if I spoke out.'&#xD;
'BahI impossible! You could do-no such&#xD;
~hing. Yet, I don'tknow;, perhaps you..are&#xD;
right,' said Nicholas Godard, passing at ouch&#xD;
4rorn astonishment and positive denial to&#xD;
doubt and ready credulity.&#xD;
'I tell yoi.. it is just as I have stated.'&#xD;
'Yes, indeed, it. may be, so,' thoughtfully&#xD;
replica Nicholas. 'They ought surely to&#xD;
have taken one or two qf the incendiaries by&#xD;
~this 1mw, if they had really been in earnest.&#xD;
~Unn there be anything underhanded that we&#xD;
bave not thought of, 1 wonder.'&#xD;
'There. is a name which, if I weren'tt&#xD;
afraid of somebody, I could mentiQll as .one&#xD;
of the terrible gang.'&#xD;
'surely you are not 'afraid of nw, .yQur&#xD;

The loQk which Jacques Chanu turned and&#xD;
fixed on the speaker was eloquent in the ex-&#xD;
land served for sufficient reply to this&#xD;
qyestion.&#xD;
So Nicholas continue4,-&#xD;
'Well, my good fellow, do tell me whom&#xD;
you suspect.'&#xD;
Lowering his voice, the countryman from&#xD;
ur.ines replied:&#xD;
:' My opinion is, that Pierre Aukin .is one&#xD;
of them.'&#xD;
Qraj~ious Heavens! Pierre Aubin?' ex-&#xD;
claimed Nicholas, in utter amazement.&#xD;
'Yes, I rep~tt the name, Pierre 4~bin,&#xD;

~Assuredly he is one of th~ml'&#xD;
'Impossible!'&#xD;
'Not in t~he least. Where is lie? 'Where&#xD;

'Well, .1 believe that you have the best of&#xD;

'Have not all these fires taken place since&#xD;
then?'&#xD;
Yes; that is true. Within the last two&#xD;
months.'&#xD;
'During all of which time Pierre Auhin&#xD;
has been missing V&#xD;
'Yes.'&#xD;
'How comes this ?-and why has the name,&#xD;
Pie'rre Azibin~ been heard at every fire, un-&#xD;
less he was present, and some one. calling to&#xD;

'Indeed I cannot say; but are you sure o4'&#xD;
that?'&#xD;
'Yes, every body knows it but you.-&#xD;
Neither is that all. Perhaps you have not&#xD;

bor, find one of Pierre's best shoes-that he&#xD;
'That is it. Did not Carupistron, my neigh-&#xD;

he djd. And father Decadi gave him a 'godd&#xD;

Also, it is only three 'days since Pierre's hat&#xD;
was found among the rubbish aboutthe ruins ~&#xD;

'So-so! It would seem that the old&#xD;
soldier is in league with the devilish incen-&#xD;
diaries !" observed Nicholas, quite staggered&#xD;
with The new aspect of affairs; 'if not, why&#xD;
did he make a secret of his son-in-law's shoe&#xD;

case.'&#xD;
'I do not say~ positively,' rejoined Chanu;&#xD;
I but I think that more improbable things have&#xD;
happened~'&#xD;
'It is a pretty joke, certainly? that we&#xD;
should'stay here to guard his house, while he&#xD;
is away ponrtiying at those who are burning&#xD;
Qur qwn houses,' said Nicholas, indignantly.&#xD;
'Yes, under pretence of taking care of a&#xD;
sick woman,' continued Chanit; and he&#xD;
added: 'I should like to know what for she&#xD;
should Want" to leave her home? I tell&#xD;

'Perhaps ~ remarked Nicholas Godard,&#xD;
quite unsuspiciously.&#xD;
Two o'clock' struck at this ji~nct!.ire, and&#xD;
&#xD;
the voices of Decadi Robert and his detaoh-&#xD;
ment were heard approaching. the house.&#xD;
Chanu felt alarmed at' his accusation of&#xD;
Cecil&amp;amp;s father.&#xD;
'Good-night! I must be off!' said he;&#xD;
'but I advise you not to repeat what I have&#xD;
been '~aying to you, or mention my name in&#xD;
the m~itter, or I -will break every bone in your&#xD;
body, as sure as there is a single bone io it.'&#xD;
With this threat, the peasant disappeared.&#xD;
Nicholas 'Godard ,needed' not this denuncia-&#xD;
tion, to keep him silent, for intuitvely he&#xD;
knew that direful consequences to himself&#xD;
would attend his opening his mouth, which&#xD;
he inwardly determined to keep closed, if&#xD;
possible, dreading, above all things, the ange&#xD;
of Decadi.&#xD;
As the party reached the house, the clown&#xD;
appeared at the door, yawning and lazily&#xD;
stretching his tired limbs. his listless looks&#xD;
relieved the mind of the anxious parent, who&#xD;
thus expressed himself:&#xD;
'The stupid animal would not have dared&#xD;
to await my return if anything had happened&#xD;
to my poor girl. Nicholas thinks too much&#xD;
of his ugly carcass, to put himself in my&#xD;
way when I am justly enraged. No-she&#xD;
must be safe.'&#xD;
Thus the good old man reasoned aloud,&#xD;
and allayed his fears.&#xD;
Nicholas made his military salute, more to&#xD;
show his skill and fine figure, than out of re-&#xD;
spect to his superior, who just at that very&#xD;
instant heard his name called in loud and&#xD;
piteous tones,, at some little distance. lie&#xD;
turned with undefined nervousness to see who&#xD;
at such an hour was calling to him.&#xD;
It was Genevieve Morvan, the nurse of (&#xD;
little Philiberte. Her. hair was streaming in&#xD;
the wind, her arms spread out wildly, and t&#xD;
her whole appearance indicating great dis- t&#xD;
tress. .&#xD;
Ror a moment, Decadi was thunderstruck;&#xD;
he trembled with dismay at the foreboding v&#xD;
sensation he experienced.&#xD;
As he advanced to meet the woman, he ~&#xD;
exclaimed,-                              s&#xD;
'Is your cottage on fire? Speak! . Yet&#xD;
that cannot .-be, or else you would. have l~&#xD;
brought the baby!' .&#xD;
Genevieve' could not speak, she was so out&#xD;
of breath with thekaste shehad made.&#xD;
'Sacrebleul Say what is the matter ? ~you h&#xD;
will drive me mad. Is th~ ~cliild .b~rnqd to&#xD;
,death?'                                 a&#xD;
&#xD;
'No-no! It is not fire, but robbery.'&#xD;
'What I you robbed 2 Wfrat can they hay.&#xD;
stolen from you?'&#xD;
Alas, alas! Philiberte.'&#xD;
'Stolen from your ho~ise, my darling?&#xD;
when?'&#xD;
'To-night.'&#xD;
'By whom?'&#xD;
'I know not.'&#xD;
'You must then have gone out and left the&#xD;
infant alone?'&#xD;
'I only went for a few minutes to take1a&#xD;
little drop of'krandy to my good man w$o&#xD;
was on guard.'&#xD;
'Wretch!' cried Decadi, transported wi~1i&#xD;
rage, and raising his hand involuntarily, asjf&#xD;
to strike her, then recollecting himself ai~,d&#xD;
checking the violent and disgraceful demon-&#xD;
stration -'--' We must inquire of all the neigh-,&#xD;
hors.~&#xD;
'I have done so,' sobbed the poor woma.p,'&#xD;
'already, and no onehas seen or heard ~m~y&#xD;

'Who could have any interest in stealg&#xD;
the child,?'&#xD;
'The fact is,' replied the agitated 'nur~e,&#xD;
'that not once only, but more than ten tirn~s&#xD;
someone has tried to carry off Philiberte.'&#xD;
'Who?'&#xD;
'Her mother.'&#xD;
Hardly had the nurse uttered these wor4~,&#xD;
when Decadi Robert bounded intQ the hpuse,&#xD;
with a vigorous push burst open the innqr&#xD;
loor, and rushed into his daughter's room.&#xD;
Cecile had disappeared!&#xD;
This flight of the wife of Pierre Aub~,&#xD;
:ompletely overcame the eqt.ianimity of.t~e&#xD;

- In the course of this deep meditation of 'I ai~ ready to listen,' replied the stately&#xD;
the beautiful and unhappy mistress of' thig beauty, pointing, as she spoke, to a chair be-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
REGINA.&#xD;
&#xD;
side her own.&#xD;
The indiscreet visitor, instead of accepting&#xD;
the offer made-we will confess solely out of&#xD;
politeness, and not from any desire to detain&#xD;
the unloved 'bridegroom-motioned his ac-&#xD;
knowledgment, but remained standing.&#xD;
Regina was delighted: for she concluded&#xD;
thence, that the visit would be short; so&#xD;
smiling graciously, she remarked:&#xD;
'I see I shall not have the pleasure of de-&#xD;
taining you long at Gazeran to-night.'&#xD;
'I say not that, dear cousin.' I had the&#xD;
honor, on first presenting myself~to mention&#xD;
that I wished for a short interview with you.'&#xD;
Agatha kept her post.&#xD;
Honored looked at the abigail, and then at&#xD;
the mistress, expecting the dismissal of the&#xD;
former, which he had not, as yet, the 'power&#xD;
to command. It was quite plain that the&#xD;
waiting~maid was a restraint that, he wished&#xD;
removed. But Agatha only laughed in her&#xD;
sleeve, without budging; and though Regina&#xD;
knew very well his r*ieaning, she pretended&#xD;
not to perceive his drift, and looked as if she&#xD;
expect'~d him to explain.&#xD;
Honor sighed, took her delicate hand, and&#xD;
pressed it awkwardly to' his lips.&#xD;
Regina laughed outright; the gentleman&#xD;
was disconcerted.&#xD;
'Well,' said he, 'what is there so amusing&#xD;
that you mock me thus?'&#xD;
At the same time, Jlonore cast a glance at&#xD;
his figure, as reflected in th~ splendid glass,&#xD;
to see if anything, in his well-ordered ap-&#xD;
parel, was unsuitable or amiss; or if there was&#xD;
anything ridiculous about his appearance.&#xD;
The examination was satisfactory to his&#xD;
vanity: for he was a noble-looking man; but&#xD;
he caught the reflection of the impertinent&#xD;
smile of Agatha. Ha! thought he, you shall&#xD;
walk pretty soon after I shall have become&#xD;
master at Gazeran!&#xD;
Honore had retained the pretty little hand&#xD;
of Regina during this short interval. She&#xD;
drew it from his amorous grasp, saying, play-&#xD;
fully,-.' Truly, if you have nothing more&#xD;
pressing to say, and only such flattering&#xD;
little gallantries to demonstrate, it would be&#xD;
as well, methinks, to postpone them till&#xD;
to-morrow-so now I will wish you good&#xD;
night.'&#xD;
There was no mistaking the lady's wish&#xD;
to terminate the visit, nevertheless thic-cava-&#xD;
her replied :- and dear cou~ln~&#xD;
'Pardon me, my fair                but&#xD;
&#xD;
57&#xD;
&#xD;
engaged as we are, I thought ~[ might in~.&#xD;
trude this evening, to ask leave to introduce&#xD;
my companions-my three brothers,-wh~&#xD;
have accompanied me to your castle.'&#xD;
Regina looked surprised, and' cooJy re-&#xD;
sponded.&#xD;
'I am very sorry that they should bave&#xD;
taken this trouble, but at this l1'our it is out&#xD;
of the question for me to receive them.'.&#xD;
'By Jove, Madam, I am fully sensible of'&#xD;
my importunity,' persisted Honore, 'but I&#xD;
am bound to tell you that we cannot return&#xD;
without having held a conference on a really&#xD;
important subject which has occasioned this -&#xD;
inopportune visit.'&#xD;
'Why cannot your business-since busi..&#xD;
ness it seems has brought' you hither-be&#xD;
put off until to morrow?'&#xD;
"To-morrow will be too joyous an occa~&#xD;
sion to deal with any thing of so serious, so&#xD;
painful a nature, a matter, in fact, which it&#xD;
is necessary should precede the happy cerc-&#xD;
mony 'of our nuptials.' -&#xD;
At this grave speech Regina's counte-&#xD;
nance became clouded, a vague uneasiness,,&#xD;
pervaded her mind, though she could not, as.&#xD;
yet, penetrate the motive of this visit, or&#xD;
the meaning of these ominous words. Still,&#xD;
as she spoke not, the intruder continued,-&#xD;
'You see, therejore, that whilst I regret&#xD;
disturbing you, I cannot delay the intervte~.&#xD;
I solicit for my brothers and myself-'&#xD;
but I promise to limit it to that only about&#xD;
which it is strictly essential to come to ax~.&#xD;
und~rstanding-and to that we doubtless .&#xD;
shall arrive.'&#xD;
The conclusion of this sentence was em-&#xD;
phasized in a manner, and. spoken with: a.&#xD;
look' which denoted some hidden meatting.,&#xD;
Regina regarded the speakerr with a fixed,.&#xD;
piercing look; but the prudent Honore had&#xD;
resumed his ordinarily smiling' and ,placid.&#xD;
expression of countenance-so that tbe ~ob-&#xD;
ject' of' the ' brothers, in this uncooked for&#xD;
visit, was still unsurmised, and sh~ ~aid,-&#xD;
'As your business is so pressing ap4 im-&#xD;
portant, ~hy did you not say so sooner, and,&#xD;
I would not have kept, my, (so soon to be)&#xD;
brothers-in-law, so long in waiting. Agatha,,&#xD;

The silence whIch er~sued was etTabar-,&#xD;
rassing,' and ~i sinister presentir~ient opjtres~ed&#xD;
the imagination of the bride at this 'myste~&#xD;
rious midnight conference. Preset4~y sijeps&#xD;
were heard, and the visitor exclaiuie4,-',Ah,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7663-00000028"/>&#xD;
I~tN~A.&#xD;
&#xD;
heye they come!'&#xD;
I shall soon know, thot~ht the anxious&#xD;
lady; and with a forced smile she addressed&#xD;
the brothers as they entered&#xD;
'Will you explain, gentlemen, what has&#xD;
procured me this honor 'I'&#xD;
They looked surprised, for they had taken&#xD;
it for granted that he whom it most con-&#xD;
cerned would have explained the purport&#xD;
of their visit. They were there not to speak,&#xD;
f/ut to act.&#xD;
Honor was ashamed, yet finding him-&#xD;
self called upon to say something in expla-&#xD;
nation, he made an effort-but his natu~a1&#xD;
timidity prevented his utterance, and with&#xD;
an appealing look to' his brothers to come&#xD;
to his aid, he remained silent.&#xD;
'Do you know,' said Regina, in tones&#xD;
which she meant to be playful, but which&#xD;
betrayed her nervous excitement (caused&#xD;
by the1 terrible alarm which she really felt)&#xD;
-' Do you know, my gdbd sirs, that so&#xD;
much hesitation and mystery are very alarm-&#xD;
ing? The affair you come about must be&#xD;
very unpleasant to' speak of- as Honore&#xD;
dares not utter it! If you, who are men,&#xD;
have not courage to speak-I begin to fear&#xD;
that I, being but a mere woman, shall not&#xD;
have the nerve to listen.'&#xD;
James, who was a blutit-spoken man-a&#xD;
ivan of middle size, with a narrow fore-&#xD;
head, small eyes, his features rendered harsh&#xD;
by deep marks of small-pox, besides hav-&#xD;
ing his left cheek scarred by a sabre-cut-&#xD;
took upon himself to address the lady of&#xD;
Gazeran,-~-&#xD;
'Why, you see, cousin, it relates to a&#xD;
veiy plain matter, a matter of course, and&#xD;
one which Honore .ought to have mention-~&#xD;
cii to you, himself, since~it is he whom&#xD;
y0u are about to marry, and, consequently,&#xD;
4'hom it most concerns. He. has scruples,&#xD;
or is afraid to speak, he is bashful-though&#xD;
so near the wedding this delicacy is folly.&#xD;
There ought to be an end to it, and&#xD;
I' will be plain and candid. I am a free-&#xD;
spoken man.' -&#xD;
'Can "any one overhear . us?' inquired&#xD;
flonore, looking uneasily around.&#xD;
'No, it i~ impossible-continue, I be-&#xD;
sceech you!' said Regina wiih feverish mo-&#xD;
tion, and addressing James, who accord~&#xD;
ingly proceeded, though in a somewhat&#xD;
1ower tone.&#xD;
'We have come to speak about the man&#xD;
&#xD;
who is here.'&#xD;
Stunned by this announcement, and speak-&#xD;
ing as if she had not "rightly understood,&#xD;
Regina ejaculated-&#xD;
'What did you say?'&#xD;
~The prisoner whom you have had here&#xD;
for two months, we mean,' said William.&#xD;
'Well, what of him?' gasped the lady,&#xD;
supportng herself with difficulty on the&#xD;
back of a chair.&#xD;
Antoine, the shrewd dwarf, who had stood&#xD;
aloof, in a corner, noticed her troubled&#xD;
manner, an~ muttered very low-&#xD;
'It is as I guessed.'&#xD;
Honore now spoke to his betrothed in&#xD;
his softest tones,-&#xD;
'Well, my beautiful bride, this man has&#xD;
been a prisoner long enough; he cannot&#xD;
remain forever, where we left him!'&#xD;
'No doubt he is weary of coufinement,'&#xD;
observed the dwarf with a cruel sneer.&#xD;
'In short, I have said it, my lady of&#xD;
Gazeran-there must be an end made to&#xD;
him. We must finish him.' brutally blunt-&#xD;
ed out the former speaker, James.&#xD;
'Finish him! What do you mean, gen-&#xD;
tlemen?' said Regina, with such visible&#xD;
anxiety that it could not escape the vigi-&#xD;
lant notice of Antoine.&#xD;
On my soul, I,      think there could&#xD;
be no mistaking the meaning of these words,&#xD;
no two ways about it!' drily remarked&#xD;
William.&#xD;
'Yes!' continued James, 'the existence&#xD;
of this man is an insult to you, Madam.&#xD;
To us it is an annoyance, and we have&#xD;
come to remove the cause of embarrass-&#xD;
ment.-He must die.'&#xD;
Regina shuddered, and exclaimed,-&#xD;
'Die! It is murder!'&#xD;
'Listen to me, dearest,' said Honore,&#xD;
persuasively modulating his accents-' You&#xD;
need not be frightened~ my love; you are&#xD;
not called' upon to take any part in that&#xD;
which has to be, or even to know any&#xD;
thing about what takes place. This man,&#xD;
you have', informed us, has dured to insult&#xD;
you with' his' love, to persecute you with&#xD;
his scandalous passion. Your courage alone&#xD;
preserved you from being dishonored. This&#xD;
man~ deserves to be punished. *This man&#xD;
must not live. Iwho 'to-morrow shall have&#xD;

not pardon thi~ man, whose existence would&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
REGINA.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Then you have resolved to put him to'&#xD;
death ?' asked Regina, looking from one to&#xD;
another of the brothers, who remained un-&#xD;
moved.&#xD;
James ,-not knowing what to make of&#xD;
the Strange expression of her features, which&#xD;
Antoine readily comprehended,-bnisqueI1~&#xD;
replied,-' Of course, Madam, you will not&#xD;
wish him to be taken hence, eh!'&#xD;
'No, I would have him remain where you,'&#xD;
yourselves, my avengers, placed him; b~t I&#xD;
would have him left alive.'&#xD;
'A woman's plan I-' object~l William,&#xD;
shrugging his shoulders. 'Revenge is sweet-&#xD;
er for being prolonged-but you must be&#xD;
content with having enjoyed that pleasure&#xD;
for the last two months. It is not proper,&#xD;
under the circumstances, to continue it&#xD;
longer. Once again, I siy, there must 'be&#xD;
an end to it.'&#xD;
'It is plain,' added the dwarf, in his little&#xD;
shrill, harsh voice, 'that each hour of this&#xD;
man's life is dangerous to us.'&#xD;
'Lower, brother! Speak lower!' said the&#xD;
timd Honore, fearful that the terrible 'con-&#xD;
versation might, in part, be heard from with-&#xD;
out. 'Of course it is all settled, and' the'&#xD;
lady of ~iazeran will give us the key of the&#xD;
dungeon. The game-keeper, I suppose, is&#xD;
still in the Same place?'&#xD;
At this question a deep blush arose to the&#xD;
very forehead' of the lady, though' none of&#xD;
them attributed it to the true cause.&#xD;
'All that we want is this key-the rest&#xD;
follows, of course. We should not have&#xD;
had to tease you with the unpleasant subject,&#xD;
had you left it with us as we desired. The&#xD;
thing would have been done by now, and&#xD;
you would have known nothing about it,'&#xD;
remarked William with perfect sang-froid!&#xD;
Regina shuddered with horror as ~he&#xD;
ahstractedly regarded the vile wretches who&#xD;
spoke, and flonore nervously added-A.&#xD;
'The night is dark, the wind blows a hur-&#xD;
ricane. Every body in ~he castle will ~soon&#xD;
be asleep, so we need fear nointerruption in&#xD;
this indispensible execution. Besides, the&#xD;
dungeon is in the other wing of the castle,&#xD;
under the gi~and saloon which is ui~ocou-&#xD;
pied.'&#xD;
'Certainly,' said Antoine, 'the old dt~n-&#xD;
geons are situated on the other side. Below&#xD;
this, Madam, I suppose tbere are none '?'&#xD;
'None!' falsely affirmed' Regiua.'-.bub h~r&#xD;
voice was unsteady, and a deadly paleri~ss&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
came over her.&#xD;
'Then every thing is favorable,' repliedV&#xD;
flon~te.&#xD;
'Antoine has beneath his cloak all that'it'&#xD;
needed!' bluntly remarked James.&#xD;
'Yes; truly,' was the dwart~s answer.&#xD;
',Give us the key, then, sister,' said Wit.'&#xD;
ham, 'and then ad~eu until to~m~rrow!"&#xD;
During these heartless speeches Regina"&#xD;
had stood in' silence, with' hei ftice averted.&#xD;

Honore-who 'had' been rathe~ alai'rrted at&#xD;

st~pi'mered.&#xD;
'How dreadful!' said the really frightened&#xD;
Pierre. Then after'listening a moment with'&#xD;
breathless eagerness, he added,-&#xD;
'No, it is only the wind! I hear no&#xD;
one!'&#xD;
'I tell you tome one is coming. Alas,&#xD;
they must have discovered our flight!'&#xD;
Who?'&#xD;
'Those who carried you off.'&#xD;
'It was not by your orders, "then, Mad-&#xD;
amp'&#xD;
'I was obliged to permit it, but it was not&#xD;
my wish. I am at their castle.'&#xD;
'At V~dganest?'&#xD;
'Yes, at Valganest,' she boldly affirmed.&#xD;
'How came you here, yourself, Madam?'&#xD;
Instead of replying, Regina pretended&#xD;
a fre~h alarm.&#xD;
"'1~hey are coming, I am sure. Fly that&#xD;
way, until the danger is past. It is your&#xD;
only chance.'&#xD;
As the artful woman said this she pointed&#xD;
in the direction she wished him to take, and&#xD;
Pierre, misled by her well-acted terror did&#xD;
as he was desired.&#xD;
'Go on,' said she, 'I will wait a moment&#xD;
to listen whether they have hit upon our&#xD;
track.'&#xD;
Soon she was flying 'after him. Agony&#xD;
was in her voice~ as ,on reaching him she&#xD;
exclaimed,-&#xD;
'F'ly quicker, they are at hand. I would&#xD;
have saved you I .They will not spare me&#xD;
now! It is over with us both!'&#xD;
There was such, an appearance of sin-&#xD;
cerity in the delivery of this speech, and the&#xD;
voices and footsteps of the two. fugitives&#xD;
reverberated with so confused and echoing, a&#xD;
sound, that it was not haid 'to V&#xD;

~Guided by the light of the lantern, Pierre&#xD;
ran on at hazard, until passing through jhe&#xD;

~th,,an obstacle-a wall:&#xD;
That instiiut th9 door, through which he&#xD;
hal '~insuspicious1y passed, was shut and,&#xD;
doulile.locked!&#xD;
Regina was now sure of having her prey&#xD;
within h~r' power, and 'clambering up the&#xD;
rough st6ne wall,' with marvellousagility she&#xD;
r~ch~d ~h~\i ron wicket, holding. on, by'&#xD;
~dW~h~ she' said to\her'prisoner&#xD;
~,Oh, Pierre Aubin, should I not have&#xD;
&#xD;
been. mkd to have set you free, when YOU&#xD;
thought me kind'enough to do so, since your&#xD;
first thoughts and words were of another?&#xD;
Truly should I have been foolish to permit&#xD;
you t6 learn from other lips than mine-that&#xD;
you are not at Valganest, but at Gazeran.'&#xD;
Then to give' her conduct the color of' a&#xD;
recent change of intention, she~continued,-&#xD;
'Happily your ingratitude opened my&#xD;
eyes, in time, to the imprudence which 'I&#xD;
was about to commit. Now, and forever&#xD;
are you in my power, obdurate man!'&#xD;
Confounded by this bold deception, and&#xD;
fallen from such bright hopes to the depth of&#xD;
despair, the wretched man was, at first,&#xD;
unable to move or speak. He was over-&#xD;
whelmed by this apparent refinement on&#xD;
cruelty-raising hopes purposely to disap-&#xD;
point them, and thatwith no visible motive-&#xD;
for Regina withheld the fact that this change&#xD;
of' prison would, at least, secure him from&#xD;
the attempts of others, on his life.&#xD;
As soon as the. unfortunate Pierre recov&#xD;
ered from the first shock, he used his now&#xD;
unmanacled limbs, in violent efforts to burst&#xD;
the door-but it resisted all his power. Fu-&#xD;
rious at his impotence to escape, he vocife-&#xD;
rated a torrent of invectives on his tormenter&#xD;
and betrayer.&#xD;
To which the only reply she vouchsafed&#xD;
was-&#xD;
'Pierre, you may one day learn that 1&#xD;
spoke but the truth, in saying that I came to&#xD;
save you!'&#xD;
Regina then withdrew, the captive watch-&#xD;
ing her retiring figure (through the key-&#xD;
hole) until the closing of a second door,&#xD;
which was at the end of the corridor, ex-&#xD;
cluded him from the rest of his species.&#xD;
We have thus' seen how the game-keeper&#xD;
had exchanged one dungeon for another,&#xD;
where he had languished ever since, seeing&#xD;
the face of no living creature, not even that&#xD;
of his beautiful' j~tilor, who attended dail~r,&#xD;
transmitting his food through the iron wi~k-&#xD;
et, a~ she dared not open the door, and for a&#xD;

Thi~ determined woman had settled in&#xD;
her o~vn' tidod, how to act according to&#xD;
whichever., alternative' the 'c~~tive might&#xD;
choose to adopt. She had closed all the&#xD;
&#xD;
doors behind her, as usual, except the last,&#xD;
that already spoken of at' the end of the&#xD;
corridor. On this occasion her agitation&#xD;
was not counterfeit-even, she trembled, at&#xD;
the possibility that Pierre might refuse her&#xD;
offer, knowing the fatal consequence-.-his&#xD;
intended immediate destruction. She 'felt&#xD;
that sho had need of all her indomitable&#xD;
spirit, to sustain her in this trying hour.&#xD;
No sound could the agitatedworutin de..&#xD;
tect by placing her ear to the door of his&#xD;
cell! Silence reigned as in the grave!&#xD;
'Pierre! Pierre!' she crIed, in her sweet-&#xD;
nest and most impassioned accents.&#xD;
No answer was returned.&#xD;
Regina was alarmed at the complete ab-&#xD;
sence of all movement or sound within.&#xD;
Clambering up to the wicket, by help of the&#xD;
irregularity of the damp stones of which the&#xD;
massive wall was built, she directed the rays&#xD;
of the lantern, 'so as to get a view of the&#xD;
tuterior before opening the door.&#xD;
The prisoner was quietly seated on the&#xD;
miserable bed in the corner of his cell.&#xD;
Looking up. he cast a glance of disdain at&#xD;
Regina, who exclaimed,-&#xD;
'Pierre, oh my dear Pierre, why do you&#xD;
preserve so long a silence-silence to me so&#xD;
painful! Still mute I But you cannot help&#xD;
hearing me. This even is a consolation to&#xD;
mc. Besides, I see you, and I blush not to&#xD;
avow that my happiness depends on this&#xD;
satisfaction.'&#xD;
.Still no reply, and Regina continued,-&#xD;
'I would much rather heat' your angry&#xD;
reproaches, than~ endure this maddening&#xD;
silence. I suffer as well as you. Indeed&#xD;
you may believe mel Your fate is bad&#xD;
enough, but mine is infinitely worse '1&#xD;
know you have lost confidence in my pro-&#xD;
fessions-because you believe I have already&#xD;
once betrayed you. But whether you believe'&#xD;
~me or not, I assure you~ with sacred truth,&#xD;
that to this forced treachery you owe your&#xD;
life-for your abductors would have mur-&#xD;
dered you. But for me you would not, at&#xD;
this instant, be alive! I only deceived in&#xD;
order to save you~&#xD;
Regina expected that this declaration&#xD;
w9uld have produced some' effect. in het~&#xD;
favor, and to observe, if possible, what sort'&#xD;
of feeling her touching address had. pro-&#xD;
.duced, sh~ peered intently through the&#xD;
grated aperture.&#xD;
Pierre merely shrugged his shoulders, and.&#xD;
&#xD;
turned away his head contemptuously.&#xD;
'Oh, but this is dreadful! He will ,no~&#xD;
listen to me! He does not believe me I&#xD;
how shall I. gain credit for my assertions! *&#xD;
Pierre, I swear, by every thing that is sacred.&#xD;
in Heaven or upon earth, that but for r~y~&#xD;
protection, which you~ despise-this very&#xD;
night you would have been murdered.'&#xD;
'No, not so!' replied he. 'To do that&#xD;
they must have caught me napping,-~--an4&#xD;
this night I could not sleep! There is no&#xD;
sleep for me!'&#xD;
Without noticing the ironical tone of these&#xD;
words, and their ambiguous sense, Regina~,&#xD;
too happy to think of aught else, cried out1&#xD;
joyfully,-&#xD;
'Thank goodness I hear you speak once&#xD;
more! No, Pierre, they cannot 'kill you~&#xD;
for I will not have it so. I will guard your&#xD;
life,, for it is more precious to rue than my,&#xD;

treasure-and to none but to me shall you&#xD;

&#xD;
REGINA.                           67&#xD;
&#xD;
inors were rife against them on so many&#xD;
grounds.&#xD;
It was not difficult to scale the outer. wall&#xD;
and gain admittance to the dwelling which&#xD;
~bey had never entered but once, which was&#xD;
on the memorable evening when the singulmir&#xD;
proposition of their father was made known&#xD;
-to them.&#xD;
'Here we are, and there is time enough&#xD;
before daylight for us to make thorough&#xD;
rummage in ~vcry nook and corner-but&#xD;
what are we 'o do for a light ?-it is pitch-&#xD;
dark within,' said Antoine.&#xD;
'It cannot be,' replied Honore, 'that he&#xD;
who left such a sum of money behind him&#xD;
could be so' stingy as to have used up every&#xD;
bit of candle in the house, or carried off the&#xD;
last match; and if the bId woman has pot&#xD;
stolen it, there surely ought to be a tinder-&#xD;
box somewhere.'&#xD;
This seemed plausible, so they descended&#xD;
,~' to the kitchen, and began groping about to&#xD;
discover, by feeling, the means Qf striking a&#xD;
light. As Antoine was stretching up to the&#xD;
chimney-piece, the toe of his boot happened&#xD;
to touch the ashes on the hearth, and dis-&#xD;
covered some live coals~' The brothers, were&#xD;
amazed and startled at this phenQmenon.&#xD;
James laid his hand on the ashes-they were&#xD;
hot Trembing all over, at this discovery,&#xD;
Ilonure said, 'some one must inhabit this&#xD;
house at the present time-and yet it was&#xD;
but yesterday that Bartholomew assured us&#xD;
that it h~d been vacant ever since the disap-&#xD;
pearance of the Major, which we know is&#xD;
more than a year.'&#xD;
'We shall soon ascertain, for certain, for&#xD;
prudence demands that we search every room&#xD;
above and below, to discover whether there&#xD;
is any one in the house besides ourselves,~&#xD;
firmly spoke William.&#xD;
'What if we should encounter a stran-&#xD;
ger?'&#xD;
'No matter, we must say that we have&#xD;
lost our way, and are seeking shelter until&#xD;
morning.'&#xD;
This point settled, ther&amp;amp;was no diflioulty&#xD;
in kiiidliag a blaze, by the light of which&#xD;
they discovered a piece of a candle, and&#xD;
then they commenced a regular, but unsuc..&#xD;
cosaful, research ,for the two hundred thou~&#xD;
sand francs.&#xD;
Ja vain they sounded the waIls, and peered&#xD;
into every place capable, or likely t~ con-&#xD;
ceal the missing treasure or a ~myste~ious&#xD;
&#xD;
inhabitant. Saving the glowing embers&#xD;
everything betokened that the place: had&#xD;
long been, and still remained altogether&#xD;
uninhabited.&#xD;
'We are alone in the House!' said James.&#xD;
'And yet,'; replied Honore, 'some one&#xD;
must have been here, and that lately, for the&#xD;
fire could not have kindled itself-or the&#xD;
ashes 'retain heat for a year. To believe&#xD;
that would be to give credit to fairy-tales.'&#xD;
'Or to believe in ghosts,' murmured&#xD;
Honor, with a singular expression of voice.&#xD;
He' wished to appear brave and scepti5al,&#xD;
whilst, in reality, he was a coward'.&#xD;
Antoine bad been silent and thoughtful&#xD;
for some moments, apparently absorbed ip&#xD;
unpleasant reflection. lie was, in truth,&#xD;
passing in review all that occurred in the&#xD;
late visit to Regina, and the belief that they&#xD;
bad been iniposed on by the beautiful lady of&#xD;
the castle, Was' rapidly gaining strength and&#xD;
shape. Suddenly he exclaimed ~&#xD;
'Gentlemen, we have been duped'! I&#xD;
would lay my life on it! Our sister-in-law,&#xD;
that is to be, has deceived us! Pierre Anbin,&#xD;
you riiay depend on it, is no longer at Gaze-&#xD;
ran!'&#xD;
The brother s could no~ credit this a~sei~-&#xD;
tion. What motive could Regina hai~efor&#xD;
doing so'~ This they though;, and to this&#xD;
effect they expressed thcms~lves.&#xD;
'Blind must you be not to see that she&#xD;
madly loves the game-keeper. Each lo6k&#xD;
'and word betrayed her, and yet you~ sus-&#xD;
pected It not.'~ So spoke the dwarf.&#xD;
'Can it be possible?' exclaimed the'in~dig-&#xD;
nant bridegroom. 'The question 'at pres-&#xD;
ent,' continued Antoine, 'is not how this&#xD;
affects you individually, brother; we must&#xD;
only consider how to discover what haw be-&#xD;
come of the wretch whom you ,spared~ why&#xD;
I know not, when it would have been so easy&#xD;
to have settled him for ever I'&#xD;
But,', inquired William, whose imagina-&#xD;
tion was not ~qnick enongh, at once, t~i s~ige&#xD;
the eircnmstanees that had brought Antoine&#xD;
so speedily to a conclusion-' but what ~&#xD;
son have'you f~r a8sertir~gthat Pierre \Anbin&#xD;
is no longer a prisoner at Gazeran 1'&#xD;
'One, is, that, on no other supposition&#xD;
can I inceount for h~r tinwillin~ness to per-&#xD;
mit us, at once,, to execute a jud~rnent in&#xD;
which, ostensibly, she acquiesced.' AL~other,&#xD;
,that no one but Pierre could have beei~ ler~,&#xD;
where he, doubtless,' knew he should find&#xD;

&#xD;

li~d. ~ny interest in coming here;'&#xD;
'Too true!' gloomily responde4-the others.&#xD;
'Bt~t before saying any thing to Regina&#xD;
on the subject,' interposed Honore, 'it would&#xD;
be well to make ~ure, positively, that the&#xD;
man is actually no longer in his dungeon.&#xD;
We have yet' two hours to day-light, and&#xD;
Gazeran is but three quarters of a league&#xD;
distant hence.- To korse--- To Gazeran.'&#xD;
- Silence again reigned within the deserted&#xD;
rooms, as the excited party rode rapidly&#xD;
back to the castle they had visited once&#xD;
before on this eventful night.&#xD;
The ashes were still hot on the forsaken&#xD;
heirth, how they became so remained a&#xD;
mystery!&#xD;
* Well did the brothers remember the vari-&#xD;
ous turnings and windiiigs, which Regina&#xD;
had directed them how to follow, beneath&#xD;
the inhabited part of the castle, in order to&#xD;
reach the dungeon-vaults wh~re they were&#xD;
to deposit the unhappy victim-the game-&#xD;
keeper-.--on the occasion of their carrying&#xD;
him off-and easily did they force admittance,&#xD;
for what scruples could they have about&#xD;
scaling a wall or forcing locks, who had&#xD;
none in taking the life of a fellow-creature,&#xD;
and he, moreover, the beloved son of their&#xD;
father?&#xD;
We have seen that the lady had refused&#xD;
them the keys of the three intervening doors,&#xD;
but these obstacles deterred them not, each&#xD;
successively gave way to their united efforts&#xD;
and the brothers reached the corridor that&#xD;
led to the original dungeon of Pierre Aubin.&#xD;
Here there was rio lock to force-the door&#xD;
was open-~--the flag-stone displaced-the&#xD;
prison-vault empty V.&#xD;
James and William uttered exclamations&#xD;
of rage. Honor became pale and speech-&#xD;
less with mortification and jealousy.&#xD;
'As to Antoine he spake not a word&#xD;
but immediately let himself down into the&#xD;
yawning tomb. He determined to make&#xD;
sure of the worst,&#xD;
'Well?' eagerly called his brothers from&#xD;
above.    -&#xD;
'No one is here!' was the instant r~ply.&#xD;
'Then come up Antoine,' they said,&#xD;
str~tching down their arms to assist his&#xD;
ascent.       was about&#xD;
-The  it~ar~f         to com~Iy, when&#xD;
suddenly l~e shouted-' Wait.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Have you made any discovery? What&#xD;
is it?&#xD;
'Perhaps so-but wait I say-we shall&#xD;
soon see:'&#xD;
The -light vanished and the figure of&#xD;
Antoine disappeared from the view of the&#xD;
three brothers.&#xD;
Twice the impatient and astonished Ho-&#xD;
nore called for the dwarf-but no answer&#xD;
was returned, and they, all, were at a loss to&#xD;
account for this strange disappearance.&#xD;
'We most follow lest any mischance befall&#xD;
him,' cried James, leaping down into the&#xD;
lower vault, tind his brothers followed his&#xD;
example. The darkness did not admit their&#xD;
distinguishing any object, but they felt&#xD;
around the damp walls -of the six - feet&#xD;
square, dungedh-over the rugged floor and&#xD;
across the empty space.&#xD;
Honor speedily remarked, that the air,&#xD;
instead of only coming down from above,&#xD;
blew on hi~ cheek from one side.&#xD;
Having their attention turned to this little&#xD;
circumstance, the rest agreed that so it was.&#xD;
Let us leave th~in-to seek an explana-&#xD;
tion of this current of air, and the sudden&#xD;
disappearance of Antoine-and return to&#xD;
those whom we left in circumstances- so&#xD;
perilous and seemingly desperate. -&#xD;
-     CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE Lady of Gazeran and the gam~-keep-&#xD;
er of the forest of Brasseuse wer~i alone and&#xD;
locked up in the most secret dungeons of the&#xD;
Castle, at the very time whilst the aristocrat&#xD;
brothers were exploring the deserted cell in&#xD;
which 'they had deposited their victim.&#xD;
In the delirium of her passion, the beauti-&#xD;
ful mistress of great wealth, vast possessions,&#xD;
and high rank, was here self-immolated, and&#xD;
willing to resign all these coveted enjoyments&#xD;
to prove the truth and force of hcr questioned&#xD;
love!&#xD;
Proudly she cast a look of love and pride&#xD;
on her stoical companion, and she was sill.&#xD;
quivering with the excitement of her fell re-&#xD;

shall I not die a lingering death to prove my&#xD;
sinCerity and devotedness? Nevertheless,&#xD;
she felt a momentary happiness in view of the&#xD;
sacrifice she was making.&#xD;
It - was a matter of no little wonder to&#xD;
Regina, that Pierre manifested no sign oi~up-&#xD;
prehension at the moment when not the ynost&#xD;

the key from James.&#xD;
At, length . the key begins to creak in the&#xD;
rusty boek, .TJie prisoner is on the verge 'of&#xD;

when, by a suddenn' mysterious revulsionn of&#xD;
feeling in the frenzied Regina, she-who had&#xD;
sought the ruin of her unfortunate victim,&#xD;
now when' no, aid from any other quarter&#xD;
could save him-resolved to come to his&#xD;
rescue herself in this dire extremity.&#xD;
'Take courage, Pierre, I entreat you.-&#xD;
Take heart; man; and once more try again,&#xD;
I implore. I will delay them.'&#xD;
As thus she spake, this woman, lately so&#xD;
formidable and relentless, joined her hands in&#xD;
earnest entreaty,&#xD;
Pierre, 'in surprise and perplexity, gazed&#xD;
on her suspiejously, to discover if she was&#xD;
speaking in sincerity or mockery.&#xD;
When'the words really proceed from the&#xD;
heart, they find a response that carries instant&#xD;
conviction, of their, truthfulness. Pierre dis-&#xD;
trusted her no longer.&#xD;
With renewed hope and ardor, he once&#xD;
more ventures into the narrow outlet, which&#xD;
would lead to safety or tke grave.&#xD;

by a sudden inspiration, throws the mattress&#xD;
over the aperture, and extinguishes the light.&#xD;

'But we are four to qne,' continued James;&#xD;
and with his powerful fist he struck the door&#xD;
a tremendons blow.&#xD;
It gave way, but instantly re-close5l.&#xD;
Antoine, in~tead, of lending his assi~tanc,&#xD;
to this effect, clambered up once more to the&#xD;
bars, and, casting the rays 'of the lantern on&#xD;
the interior of the cell, called out,-&#xD;
'Pierre is not there! It is our cousip who&#xD;
is holding 'the door l'&#xD;
The last words of the dwarf were unheard,&#xD;
for, pushing with all theirmight, they burst&#xD;
open the door, upsetting and bruis~og ppor&#xD;
Regina de (jazeran, who, as she fell almost&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
senseless, yet murmured ,~'.&#xD;
'He has escaped .1' They will n0t 'ki&#xD;
him 1'&#xD;
Not suspecting that Pi~trre Auble wa&#xD;
really gone, some little time elapsed in .ti~yin~&#xD;
to revive the fainting lady, who, knowing th&#xD;
value to the fugitive of every montent's de&#xD;
lay, was in no haste to recover.&#xD;
Antoine was keeping guard withJantet&#xD;
at the door, whilst the other two were ocen&#xD;
pied in the restoration of the bride. Pre&#xD;
Gently, he thought of raising the lantern' o&#xD;
take a survey' of the place. , .&#xD;
'Master Pierre niust have, hid hirr~el&#xD;
under the bed, I fai~cy, for he 'is not to. bi&#xD;
seen,' cried he.&#xD;
This observation caused Regina to move&#xD;
in her alarm, on seeing the assassins put ~o&#xD;
the track.&#xD;
'She is coming to herself 1' said William.&#xD;
relinquishing th" lady altogether to the cart&#xD;
of Honor; ''let, us see' afiet 'hI'm.'&#xD;
'Ycs, now for hini!' said Antoine, who&#xD;
brave in his reliance on his, brother's assist.&#xD;
ance, and eager to be the one tolay hands oj~&#xD;
the hated game-keeper, rushed towards the&#xD;
prisoner's bed. Raising the mattress, he per-&#xD;
ceived the excavation beneath, .at which sighi&#xD;
he uttered, a piercing cry. of baffled rage.&#xD;
Like a wild beast entering its.deji, did the&#xD;
dwarf disappear in the narrow subterranean&#xD;
passage;. but he soon, returned, and announc-&#xD;
ed, in tones of disappointed hate, that there&#xD;
was no outlet to the hole, thathe had follow'-&#xD;
ed the p~issage until fitrther progress was ob-&#xD;
structed by a large flag-stone whieh he had&#xD;
found it impossible to re[nove.&#xD;
Regina, whose anxiety had been intense&#xD;
during the exploration (by ,the dwarf) of the&#xD;
avenue to escape and freedom, now raised&#xD;
her eyes, with gratitude, to Heaven, and&#xD;
breathed freer. She ret~diiy guessed that&#xD;
Pierre had taken the precaution to 'interpose,&#xD;
between him apd' his adyersaries, the .obst~-&#xD;
cle whiobbad so .J.ately. nearly caused h~s&#xD;
destruction 'by inipedinghis flight.&#xD;
.Ii~mes, in anger at his. intelligence, ex-&#xD;

were ~iow turningn' to Valganest. 'He now&#xD;

Re-called, by the speech of the wood-cut-&#xD;
ter's wife, to the present object; Pierre Aubin&#xD;
inquired the 'way to Brasseuse. Having ob~&#xD;
tamed directions, he continued hisroute, his&#xD;
thoughts still bent on 'the child h~ had seen,&#xD;
'wondering whose it could be. Certainly,&#xD;
thought he, it cannot belong to the~ old. wo-&#xD;
man, it is too sweet a little creature:&#xD;
The way was long; but each step was bring-&#xD;
ing him nearer1to those: from whom he had&#xD;
been so cruelly separated for two weary&#xD;
months of solitude and confinement-those&#xD;
beings the dearest of all on earth to him; and&#xD;
he felt not the 'length or loneliness of his&#xD;
journey.&#xD;
'CHAPTER XII!.&#xD;
A sUDDEN turn in tha road revealed to the&#xD;
wondering gaze of the retreating game-keep.&#xD;
er, the village of Brasseuse, in all its altered&#xD;
aspect. So great was the change since the&#xD;
burning'of 'La rangeg' farm-house, that he&#xD;
fancied he must have mistaken the way, and&#xD;
that it 'was some other village that he beheld&#xD;
in the distance. During his captivity,' the&#xD;
fires had, unknown to him, been doing their&#xD;
devastating work.&#xD;
Ignorant of' all that had passed beyond his&#xD;
prison walls, no wonder that Pierre Aubin&#xD;
was confounded with astonishment as he&#xD;
looked around 'him. Enough of the ruined&#xD;
houses, however, remained standing, to satis-&#xD;
fy him that he had not gone astray, and that&#xD;
the dwelling of his loved ones was before him.&#xD;
But soon a new cause of wonder presented&#xD;
itself. His progress was suddenly arrested&#xD;
by a fixed bayonet thrust right before him as&#xD;
he musing'iy sauntered along, and a voice in&#xD;
quaking accents nieiiaced him with death.&#xD;
'Halt! Approach a step, and I fire.'&#xD;
Pierreat once recognized Nicholas Godard,&#xD;
the plough-boy and jester, in the would.be&#xD;
valiant, yet evidently timorous, peasant&#xD;
soldier.&#xD;
In delight at' once again seeing one of his&#xD;
former acquaintances, Pierre stretchedout his&#xD;
hand cordially&#xD;
'Mi~takiiig the friendly intent~ Nicholas&#xD;
Godard tfrew back,'levelled his rusty musket&#xD;

at the game-keeper's breast, and 'called out , The gam&#xD;

'I know you are an-incendiary.  Keep off,  'The win&#xD;

was CeclIe, his beloved wife who had left the&#xD;
babe theie, whilst on her w'ay' to Gar~erari,&#xD;
which they had made out from her incohe-&#xD;
rent sentences.&#xD;
There was 'great and fresh &amp;amp;ause for alarm!&#xD;
Had the unf~rtuna'te woman reached her ii-&#xD;
val's castle previous to his quitting it? Was'&#xD;
this the solution of Regina's permitting him&#xD;
escape? Perhaps she knew full well the&#xD;
tortur~ irt sfore for him when disappointed of&#xD;
his wife's smiles and caresses, and thus ven~&#xD;
gence would pierce him to the very quick&#xD;
What dreadful' doubts to assail an affec-&#xD;
tioruate and devoted husband! Poor Cecile!&#xD;
so gentle! How would her crushed spirit&#xD;
bear this additional misery, if indeed, sepa-&#xD;
rated from child as well as husband, she were&#xD;
captive to' the fierce and 'vindictive lady of&#xD;
Gazeran, and perchance now an inmate of&#xD;
that dreadful dungeon from which the game-&#xD;
keer had but' just' emerged!&#xD;
Pierre Aubin determined, at all hazard to&#xD;
himself, to return and learn the 'worst. Ilair-&#xD;
ing with difficulty obtained permirr~ion, from&#xD;
the old woman, td'embrace the in~nt.le~ in&#xD;
hei charge-for she liked not his looks-he&#xD;
once again set out' on his travels.&#xD;
Disappointment 'still awaited him. On&#xD;
reaching 'the castle he learned to his dismay&#xD;
that' Regina had left at dawn fbr Paris! In&#xD;
reply to his eager and almost frantic inquiry,&#xD;
whether Cecile had been 'there, he was as-&#xD;
sured she had not-but she had been seen&#xD;
wandering in the forest like a crazy woman.&#xD;
It was, by this time, evening, and faint&#xD;
weary and sorrowful Pierre retraced his steps&#xD;
to the hut, where hi&amp;amp; child had been left,&#xD;
trusting 'That maternal instinct' would bring&#xD;
the wanderer there, 'i*~ unharmed 'and at Ii-&#xD;
be~'ty. -&#xD;
It happened that the old couple, who lived&#xD;
iii -this xohit'ary place, were but recently esta~&#xD;
tabli~hea in the forest and knew nbt the 'name&#xD;
of Pierre or Decadi 'Robert "It Was' there-&#xD;
fble~ rio r&amp;amp;assuran~e to be 'told tlf~t their&#xD;

'This maybe the case. Doubtful it is,&#xD;

&#xD;
Pierre had requested permission to await&#xD;
the return of the mother oCthe child entrust-&#xD;
~d them, and they dared not refYise him.&#xD;
Truly they fancied it was but a pretext, and&#xD;
that he was one, of the band of incendiaries,&#xD;
whom it would be as dangerous to affront as&#xD;
to retain. This was quite natural and made&#xD;
them, whilst fearful, assume to be hospital~le.&#xD;
Feeling hungry, and wishing to propitiate&#xD;
the'poor people, the gamekeeper' pouredd the&#xD;

and begged the woman to give him some&#xD;
supper and allow him to lodge with them for&#xD;
the night. Now this purse whs pretty well&#xD;
filled, containing the sum provided f6r the&#xD;
minor expenses of the christening, having&#xD;
remained untouched in his pocket ever since1&#xD;
that disastrous occasioti.&#xD;
This liberal payment, for wretched fare,&#xD;
confirmed the prejudiced mincA of his hosts,&#xD;
against the man so meanly clad. Every ex-&#xD;
cuse was made to get rid of him. They said&#xD;
that the had nb spare bed-but he replied&#xD;
that he i~ouId willingly sleep on the 'floor by&#xD;
the 'fire.&#xD;
Ak ! thought the aifrighted paid-out fate&#xD;
is settle! Our humble abode is marked out&#xD;
as the next prey to the devouring flames!&#xD;
They resolved at all events not to pass the&#xD;
night with this terrible man. 'So they con-&#xD;
sulted, apart, and riade up a little plot for the&#xD;
h~isband to denounce him whilst pretending&#xD;
t~ be seeking a bed at the nijller's, that t~e&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
usually prolonged absence of Antoine, audhe&#xD;
gan to be uneasy on his ac~ount. The letter,&#xD;
perhaps might explain the cause and enlight-&#xD;
en them. At all events they decided that&#xD;
the circumstance justified opening a letter&#xD;
plainly intended for him.&#xD;
How were they then surprised at the con-&#xD;
tents, which Honore read aloud, as follows-&#xD;
'The burning of the woodman's hut is&#xD;
to' lead to the discovery, of the instiga-&#xD;
Iik:ly you, whom it most concerns~ if found&#xD;
orsof the other conflagrations. I hasten&#xD;
out, that Clodomir was caught on the spots&#xD;
and is in the keeping of the Gendarmes. The&#xD;
wood-cutter also is in custody, and the in-&#xD;
habitants of Brasseuse are coming en masse&#xD;
0your castle. If you have any papers that&#xD;
~n compromise yourself, or any of us, de-&#xD;
stroy the documents immediately.-..an hour&#xD;
hence will be too late.'&#xD;
This revelation of a secret, which Antoine&#xD;
had kept from his brothers, tilled them with&#xD;
indignation and concern. They had admit-&#xD;
ted him into their fullest confidence, and now&#xD;
they accidental learnt his participation in a&#xD;
crime, that had devastated the country, of&#xD;
which they were guiltless. For though these&#xD;
men scrupled not to~ use any means to further&#xD;
their own interest or gratify revenge and&#xD;
hate, yet they were not familiarised with&#xD;
guilt, simply for the pleasure of inflicting&#xD;
misery on others. But right or wrong, An-&#xD;
toine was in danger, and his peril night af-&#xD;
fect themselves also.&#xD;
'If the people force an eritranqe here' oh&#xD;
served Honore, 'there is something tjnmt np&#xD;
one ought to see-and yet It is liable ,t~ be&#xD;
found.'&#xD;
He spoke of the chest whjch had been de-&#xD;
posited in the room which Antoine had not&#xD;
used since. Many times they had resolved&#xD;
to remove it, and yet had always put it off,&#xD;
a feeling of horror making tb~m dread to&#xD;
touch the, sn'bsritute for,. acofflir which -en-&#xD;
closed the corporeal proofs of Par~rid4ef&#xD;
'It must now be done,' said theothex two~&#xD;
The three brothers then went tt~ether tq&#xD;
th~ park to open the tomb, -where Fr#mneois&#xD;
had perished, and where his relpains had&#xD;
beer~ interred.&#xD;
Having accomplished this, they repaired&#xD;
to the, forsaken apartment, resolved, t~ cnn-&#xD;
quer remorse and repugnance, - and to p~aea&#xD;
the murdered, by t4e side of tke murtdere,' I&#xD;
Already from the~wirtdows, ofthe castle&#xD;

'peasantry -from Brasseuse, their numnber~&#xD;
greatly augmented, as they came along~by&#xD;
volunteers from the surrounding hamlets,&#xD;
who came prepared for deeds of violence.&#xD;
They are coining, gentlemen! - Couinage~&#xD;
-be quick!'&#xD;
The closet was thrown open. Consterna.~&#xD;
tion took the place of all other feelings-the&#xD;
chest had disappeared!!! In~ its place was&#xD;
a paper' on which was traced the ominoua&#xD;
threat,-2-- -&#xD;
'Pjerre Aubin is your brother-he is free.&#xD;
You have endangered him once; woe be to yqu&#xD;
~f you peril him again!'&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.               - -&#xD;
It is time now to e~tplain how Pierre, his&#xD;
wife, and her unknown protector, came Icr&#xD;
meet on the eminence adjoining the village&#xD;
of Vilvert at the critical time of the confla-&#xD;
gration of the woodman's hut. ' -&#xD;
At day-break of that morning the present&#xD;
guardian of Cecile, whilst wandering about&#xD;
the skirts of the forest on the Vilvert side,&#xD;
ha~discovered -the unfortunate woman in -a&#xD;
fain~iing condition, at the foot of a tree where&#xD;
she had dropped down overcome with fatigue&#xD;
and alarm.&#xD;
All night, after leaving her child at the&#xD;
wopd~cutter's, had she beenT in the damp airy&#xD;
She had been captured by a party of .tbe&#xD;
bandits, and was terrified almost to d~ath-at&#xD;
their. srreech-owlcry, which vividly - brought&#xD;
back the events that had driven her to rnadr'&#xD;
ness.                                L.&#xD;
The signal, this time oft repeated, brought&#xD;
around her, such. a fierce group that, she&#xD;
flung herself at the keeper's feet -and wildly&#xD;
pleaded Coin her, life. -&#xD;
Convinced that her insanity was not as~&#xD;
sunied, they took phy on her and revoked&#xD;
their purpose of-death, but impressed on ~her&#xD;
feeble senses-that if she, would save her&#xD;
hu~band'~ life, and if she hoped~ ever tq see&#xD;
her child~again,.shemuust repeat-to every body&#xD;
the words they tel4 her, namely- -&#xD;
There is~ut -Pie' incendiary~ and that is&#xD;
Pierr~e Aubin-L h~v0 seen him~' ' , --&#xD;
Having-thus. pinovk~ed for their owp secu~&#xD;
rity and the furtherance of the enmity ag~n~&#xD;
her husband, Ceoile was escorted -for som&#xD;
hours, by two hf the men, through ~o ~n~py&#xD;
paths-ef-the forest that, even had she posses-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7663-00000038"/>&#xD;
R1~O~A.                         7tt&#xD;
&#xD;
sed all her faculties as fully as eVer, she could&#xD;
tiot have guided any one 'to the secrefrendez-&#xD;
vous of the incendiary-gang.&#xD;
When found by the stranger, the poor&#xD;
creature was senseless and" nearly frozen.&#xD;
He knelt beside the forlorn one chafed her&#xD;
hands in his own, and recalled her to life by&#xD;
whispering in her ear 'the names of her hus-&#xD;
bend and child.&#xD;
Cecile opened her eyes at the appeal, and&#xD;
looked without alarm on the face of her pro-&#xD;
tector, whom she knew not. To induce her&#xD;
to go with him, her preserver told her he&#xD;
would conduct her to her husband. So she&#xD;
arose, and leaning on the strangers s arm in&#xD;
full confidence, went willingly along with&#xD;
him.&#xD;
On the way to the cottage, near the vil-&#xD;
Itige, where the old man dwelt alone, he ga-&#xD;
tliercd, from the mass of her incoherent 'dis-&#xD;
course, the object of her intended~expedition&#xD;
to Gazeran,. and he learnt the place where&#xD;
she had deposited'Philiberte.&#xD;
Having thus enticed her within his lonely&#xD;
dwelling, the old man changed his tone from&#xD;
gen'tlene~s to that of stern authority, for he&#xD;
had powerful reasons for not taking her&#xD;
either to (azeran or Brasseuse, to one or&#xD;
other of Which places she implored him to&#xD;
guide her. These reasons he could not 'ex-&#xD;
plain/1 tc~ the unhappy Cecile, therefore he&#xD;
was obliged to intimidate her into acquies-&#xD;
ence with 'his wish that she should, for the&#xD;
~reAent, remain with him.&#xD;
Sternly' then the really kindheartedd old&#xD;
man assured the poor wearied ineaniac that&#xD;
she must~ not attempt to leave the house or&#xD;
make 'any outcry to attract attentida, for if&#xD;
she did either-never more would she see&#xD;
husband'~r child.&#xD;
From that moment Cecile Wa~' quiet and&#xD;
resigi~ed.' '&#xD;
Towards evening a peantint came to the&#xD;
cottage vith a supply of" provisions' 'for' the&#xD;
old man, ~vho gave him some seCret order,&#xD;
Which Cecile could not hear, and soon after&#xD;
the countryman went away saying,-&#xD;
'It shall be done as you direct., sir.'&#xD;
The messenger took tJ~e 'direction to the&#xD;
forest of ilallate, and arrived at the wood-&#xD;
maui'sh~t juSt after the a~ed' couple had&#xD;
ipiitted it. He was sent by the 'friend of&#xD;
(~cile to bring aWay the child from th'ose'in&#xD;
*1te~e care the little one 'had been l'efl.&#xD;
Great Was this maWs astonishment~to meet&#xD;
&#xD;
Pieri-e, in this place, for he had known the&#xD;
gamekeeper of old, but had not heard of his&#xD;
return.&#xD;
No sooner had the man told his errand and&#xD;
where Cecile was, thaxi sure now where to&#xD;
find his unhappy wife, Pierre Aubin snatch-&#xD;
ed the babe from the cradle, and without&#xD;
asking if the honest peasant were willing to&#xD;
return without rest or refreshment-he com-&#xD;
menced a rapid walk towards Vilvert, leav-&#xD;
ing the man to follow at his leisure.&#xD;
Thus' it was that Pierre Aubin escaped the&#xD;
death prepared for him 'by the revengeful&#xD;
dwarf.&#xD;
To explain this we have only to mention&#xD;
that the aristocrat brothers being aware that&#xD;
the escaped gamekeeper could reveal their&#xD;
dastardly capture and imprisonment of him,&#xD;
and their murderous purpose, were most an-&#xD;
xious to have him again in their power.&#xD;
To this end, Antione volunteered l)i5 ser-&#xD;
vices. His jealous heart suggested that the&#xD;
beloved of Regina would linger in, or return&#xD;
to the vicinity. He 'was repaid for his vigi-&#xD;
lance by seeing Pierre (though on a different&#xD;
errand t6 that which he expected might at-&#xD;
tract him there) at the castle-ga.e, of Gaze-&#xD;
ran, inquiring for Cecile.&#xD;
How bitterly the dwarf regretted his im-&#xD;
portance, alone to cope with the object of&#xD;
his hatred on~whose traces he followed in&#xD;
hopes of tracking him to his hiding place.&#xD;
But as the wolf follows in the rear trusting&#xD;
that accident may furnish an opportunity of&#xD;
a~itacking atno powerful prey, unawares-so&#xD;
did Antoine dodge the unconscious object,&#xD;
hoping that Bdrtholomew, the faithful and&#xD;
unscrupulous old servitor of the family, or&#xD;
Clodomir, chief amongst the incendiaries,&#xD;
might 'accidently come t~ his aid. But no&#xD;
one appeared to help him, ~ai~d he saw Pierre&#xD;
enter the wood-cutter's hut.&#xD;
Antoin&amp;amp; did~net' apply' for admittance, but&#xD;
he~ peered thrc~1igh &amp;amp; crevice in the rude build-&#xD;
ing,. and 'listened until he was assured that&#xD;
~the game-keeper intended to pass the night&#xD;
there. "With ~endieh joy he overheard the&#xD;
phiL o~the old~peopIe to denounce their ttn-&#xD;
bidden gwest ~s'an incendiary, and he laid&#xD;
his plans on the suggestions 'which it in-&#xD;
spired.&#xD;
It will readily be imagined, therefore, that&#xD;
it' Was Antoine de~Labourallierc who pur&#xD;
chased the hovt~l, meaning' to burn it; with&#xD;
the uucohscioue father and child, hoping&#xD;
&#xD;
thus to rid himself of the man whom' he fear-&#xD;
ed and hated-and at' the same' time cdstihe&#xD;
blame 'of the crime on the innocent Pierre,&#xD;
by having hig name called out, as usual, ~t&#xD;
the burning of the dwelling. tiC concluded&#xD;
that the old couple, being missing,' would be&#xD;
supposed to have been consumed in the&#xD;
flames.&#xD;
We have seen that Clodomir was taken on&#xD;
'the spot with the name of his supposed ac-&#xD;
complice, Pierre Aubin, on his tongue. The&#xD;
~bargain had been revealed, and the same-&#xD;
keeper had escaped the intended destruction.&#xD;
It would seem as if the diabolical plot' was&#xD;
about to recoil on the head of its projector,&#xD;
and that Antoine, instead of Pierre, would be&#xD;
sacrificed to the popular fury.&#xD;
It is now appropriate that we revert to the&#xD;
party which we left marching to Valganest,&#xD;
and see how they were received, whilst Ce-&#xD;
cile, her husband and child are sojourning&#xD;
with their protector, to whom she shall pre-&#xD;
sently refer.&#xD;
It cannot be forgotten that the ocCasion of&#xD;
the tumultuous excitement of the populace&#xD;
of Brasseuse against the inhabitants of the&#xD;
castle, and Antoine in particular, arose from&#xD;
their identifying the dwarf as the purchaser&#xD;
of the wood-man's hut. They were deter-&#xD;
mined on sacking the house, should, he not be&#xD;
delivered up to them.&#xD;
As for the brothers, notwithstanding th&amp;amp;&#xD;
consternation they felt 'on discovering the&#xD;
abstraction of the important coffer and the&#xD;
substitution of the menacing letter-the im-&#xD;
minence of the emergency restored their&#xD;
courage and presence of mind. '&#xD;
The angry mob'were close at hand. They&#xD;
were to be seen, from the windows, fiercely&#xD;
gesticulating. These men must not be ~rri-&#xD;
tated by oppcsiition, they must be courteously&#xD;
reo~ived, imposed on by apparent frankness,&#xD;
tind the absence of all appearance of appre-&#xD;
hension. This course alone would give any&#xD;
chance of~ allaying suspicion and&#xD;
a ~search.                      avoiding&#xD;
Had it not been for the dread that the'&#xD;
c/~est of mystery might still be in the castle,,&#xD;
and that the cover might be raised; to seek&#xD;
the missiiig Antoine in its 'dark recess, atid&#xD;
reveal the skeleton remains 'of anotkeminstead I&#xD;
of the living object of their search 'th&#xD;
haught~r lords of Valganest Would doubtless&#xD;
have dared and defied scr~thi~'&#xD;
~Acting on 'this wise impuistythey gave 'di-&#xD;
&#xD;
rectione for the gates to be thrown open to&#xD;
the turbulent visitoi~s.&#xD;
The three brothers then met the intruder's'&#xD;
and blandly iriqul~red ,what was desired.&#xD;
The peoplewere unprep~.red with a reply&#xD;
suited to ~the unexpected suavity and' unco4-&#xD;
cern of the brothers. 'The reasoOs they' aS-&#xD;
signed for the absence of Antoine passed as&#xD;
valid, and one by one all their prejudices and&#xD;
convictidna vanished' for the time. The&#xD;
doors having been opened withoi~t dCt~urt,&#xD;
had dispelled a portion of the anger of' the&#xD;
crowd, who debuting a small portion of their&#xD;
number to enter, the rest remain outside, and&#xD;
after the conference-they all slunk away&#xD;
stammering excuses, embarrassed and ashain-&#xD;
ed of their temerity and audacity.&#xD;
Three weeks passed away, during which&#xD;
no further manifestations of ill feeling had&#xD;
been evinced towards the masters of Valga-&#xD;
nest-and Antoine had not yet returned&#xD;
home. It was not to be imagined that he was&#xD;
inactive, but of what he was about, his brow&#xD;
thers were ignorant, ~and were'anxious about&#xD;
his fate, dreading also the 'clisgface to the&#xD;
noble name of Labourdilli~re, should it tome&#xD;
out on the trial of Olodomir, the incen4iary,&#xD;
who had 'been arrested, that Antoine was one&#xD;
of the principal leaders of the atrocious band.&#xD;
The three weeks during which the iiit&#xD;
lasted, were an age of torture, and to secnre&#xD;

'And is it for the accomplishment of'this&#xD;
great work that bandits, such as Clodomir,&#xD;
have devoted themselves?'&#xD;
No indeed, only five men in France know&#xD;
the true meaning of what is doing and the&#xD;

these five! As for the instruments we em-&#xD;
ploy, weak or wretched, hey obey the prompt-&#xD;
ings o~ revenge or repine. If taken, so' be&#xD;
it. We can find Qthers to replace the vic-&#xD;
tims of the guillotine.'&#xD;
As Antoine gave this explanation, the three&#xD;
brothers passed from horror of the crime to&#xD;
respect for the motive that scattered disaster&#xD;
and destruction over France.&#xD;
'Now,' continued the dwarf, who sudden..&#xD;
ly appeared so great in their eyes as one of&#xD;
the secret but mighty prime movers of a&#xD;
great political party-' Now I have only to&#xD;
speak of myself. You have' not questioned&#xD;
me as to the cause of my absence.'&#xD;
'That is what I was just about to do,' said&#xD;
William.&#xD;
Antoine deliberately emptied his glass&#xD;
and gave a long narration of his late proceed-&#xD;
ings, the brief summary ~f which we shall&#xD;
present to our reader.&#xD;
The dwarf having witnessed the capture&#xD;
of Clodomir, to avoid risk to himself in case&#xD;
of betrayal, had retreated to the cellars of&#xD;
ilaut Mantel, where he had been securely&#xD;
concealed, and had prepared a fresh plot to&#xD;
gratify his party against the game-keeper of&#xD;
Brasseuse-which he assured his brothers,&#xD;
to their great alarm, he was pretty cem~tain&#xD;
would ensure his destruction by means of the&#xD;
law.&#xD;
Antoine also stated that he had greatly&#xD;
bettered their fortune whist thus' in hiding,&#xD;
in proof of. which he produced the identical&#xD;
sum, two hundred thousand francs, once prof-&#xD;
fered by major Seignerolles, and rejected, by&#xD;
the -old Marquis, as also subsequently by&#xD;
themselves. '&#xD;
To their eager queries a~ to h~w'and&#xD;
where he discovered the ~treasnre, he told&#xD;
them that having ventured to light a fire, one&#xD;
cold i~ight on the hearth of the kitchen, of&#xD;
'some oldb room handles etc., when being a  a&#xD;
loss to keep it up-he took hold ~of' an old-&#xD;
fashioned chair 'and broke it up to bzrn.&#xD;
From a cavity in the back of this antiquated&#xD;
piece of furniture the roll of bills fell out;&#xD;
&#xD;
which he now handed over for' general use.&#xD;
In their delight at this seasonable increa~&#xD;
of' funds the brothers forgot their alarm about&#xD;
Piem~re, but wondered how Antoine had si~&#xD;
lenced Coldormr.&#xD;
'Tell us quickly what you have done, and&#xD;
theti we will explain much that concerns you,&#xD;
said Wllliam.'&#xD;
'Well, then, as Clodomir knew that I wa~&#xD;
the so-called Mr. Matthien, from wj~om this&#xD;
division of the band received orders, 1 had&#xD;
fears that he might compromise me at~ the&#xD;
trial. I therefore repaired regularly at night&#xD;
to the place of rendezvous in the fore~t,~n4&#xD;
at last I found a billet in the hollow elm, eu.~&#xD;
place of deposit, in which he promised to&#xD;
maintain strict silence regarding me, proitid~&#xD;
e(l that I would pay one thousand francs.to ~&#xD;
certain woman named Elortense Malsaigne,&#xD;
whom he had formerly loved,, but had for-&#xD;
saken, and whom he now wished to secure&#xD;
from indigence.&#xD;
'The abode of this person he designated.i&#xD;
it was in Paris. I agreed to the terms, akrd&#xD;
went to the house indicated, where I satv&#xD;

not long before we concluded a treaty, which&#xD;
will effectually rid you, Honore, of a 'siv~1;&#xD;

'Alas I unhappy man I' said William ;' 'yor&#xD;
have lhrought us all into danger.'&#xD;
'How so!!' inquired the dwarf.&#xD;
They then told him of the coming of th~&#xD;
mob to the castle-the visit to the closet-&#xD;
the disappearance of the chest. They put&#xD;
inio his hands the written threat against&#xD;
them, should' they' ever' again molest their&#xD;
brother, Pierre Aubin.&#xD;
The paper fell from the hands of Antoine,&#xD;
andhe muttered,-            '&#xD;
'It is too late 'to stop! How unfortunate!&#xD;
The train is laid'!' We must ahid~ the eon~&#xD;
sequences!'&#xD;

ed, that he was at some other burning, far&#xD;
distant, on the same day and at the specified&#xD;
hour, which conflicting evidence it was~ im-&#xD;
possible to reconcile to truth.&#xD;
Although Pierre would not explain where&#xD;
he had been for the last two months, Mr.&#xD;
Simeson credited his assertion that he was&#xD;
bound to secrecy by an oath unconnected&#xD;
with the incenpi~iries or their wicked doings.&#xD;
Poor Cecile believed the tale that wa~&#xD;
invented to pacify her shattered intellects-&#xD;
that the neighbors had assembled to celebrate&#xD;
Pierre's return.&#xD;
Decadi se~~orded the magistrate's advice,&#xD;
to Pierre, to retire from Brasseuse for awhile&#xD;
to the asylum of his own residence, i, e, Mr.&#xD;
Sime.ioiis, for the sake of his wife and ~hild,&#xD;
but relying on his innocence Pierre resolved&#xD;
to stay and face the calumny. When, how.&#xD;
ever, at d irk, the house was fired, it was&#xD;
time to flee, aud secretly~ by the garden&#xD;
they escaped.&#xD;
Quietly had they stayed in their friendly&#xD;
refuge di~rhtg the trial of Clodomir, whichof&#xD;
course Pierre could not suppose would effect&#xD;
as he had never seen the man. Neither was&#xD;
there any further notice taken of Pierre by&#xD;
the people of Brrssense who were satisfied&#xD;
with having destroyed his 'dwelling and got&#xD;
rid of' him.&#xD;
During those~ three ivee~s the game-keeder&#xD;
&amp;amp;as exempt from popular indignation, but&#xD;
when the false accusation ot Clodomir, in&#xD;
his last moments revived in full force the old&#xD;
belief that he was one of the miscreants, he&#xD;
felt that the magistrate's house would no&#xD;
longer affi)rd him protection, nor could he&#xD;
hope to contint~e to be secreted by him.&#xD;
The intelligence of this fresh irritation of&#xD;
the 1)ublic mind against, the victim of cir-&#xD;
ctimstances, was brought by Decadi whp had&#xD;
remained at Brasseuse, but hurried to~ warn&#xD;
Pierre of the an' 'nymous advice. (aent\by the&#xD;
brothers) to escape, and of Clodomir's accus-&#xD;
ative confession&#xD;
Of course no one suspected that the crim.&#xD;
inal had been wrought on, by delusive hopes&#xD;
of pardon, to this perjury, therefttre the dis-&#xD;
closure was believed to be conscientious and&#xD;
true.&#xD;
'I see that I must bend to the stQrin of&#xD;
&#xD;
persecution, and out of proper consideratiQn~&#xD;
for the kind Mr. Simeron wh% has generously,&#xD;
allowed me to take refuge here during his&#xD;
absence, I must go hence-but how can I&#xD;

'Do not grieve about that my poor follow,&#xD;
I will manage it for you. Rely securely on'.&#xD;
me. If she cannot walk I will get a vehicle&#xD;
for her and the dear little Philliberte.'&#xD;
Decadi, who thus spoke, would gltidly have'&#xD;
removed his 'cherished ones instantly from&#xD;
the impending danger, but he had to s~ek a&#xD;
horse and cart, and that so discreetly that no&#xD;
one should suspect he was going to help&#xD;
Pierre to elude justice.&#xD;
'To-morrow night,' said the old soldier of&#xD;
Nap~deon, ' I will he at the entrance of the~&#xD;

was best to be done, 'though he had ~ady&#xD;

Dec~di Robert stayed not to await the&#xD;
awakening of his dear daughter Cecile, btft&#xD;
started back again to Brstsseifse to make&#xD;
preparations for the their safety.&#xD;
Pierre Aubin left Chamecy for the cotta~o&#xD;
of ihe old man who had 'rescued Cocilo, to&#xD;
see if this asylum Was still available. ~&#xD;
The poor, demented wif~ besought hii~&#xD;
not to leave her, saying, she was sure sh~&#xD;
was able to walk.&#xD;
- ijer terror at every absence, of even an&#xD;
hour's duration, was so excessive that bd&#xD;
husband did not notice at the time that&#xD;
seemed to have it prophetic presentiment 'of'&#xD;
impending peril.&#xD;
He thought it was only her usual nervous&#xD;
anxiety, and.soothing her with assurance of&#xD;
a speedy return, he set out, aone, for Vjl-&#xD;
vert.         .&#xD;
Alas! during that fatal absence, a visitQr&#xD;
had leen at Chamecy. The tuckless gatue-&#xD;
keeper returned, entered the house9and ja ~&#xD;
few moments rushed forth from it like ,a&#xD;
madma~i, and uttering fearful cries of woe&#xD;
and vengeatice.&#xD;
When Decadi came at the appointed boar&#xD;
to remove the whole party, he found enI~&#xD;

cesitowards the man, who is calling for 'her&#xD;
with the authority derived frorti grief and&#xD;
deeper tioui.&#xD;
'As soon as ~Pierre Aubin, for he it Was, per~.&#xD;
ceived Begina, he darted angrily forward tb&#xD;
rweet'her. Casting a look on the lady, that&#xD;
rooted her to~ th~ spot,' he opened the ~rheet&#xD;

end held up toher view-a dead infa,~t. It&#xD;
was Pidliberte!&#xD;
Behold your work, madam,' shid he to'&#xD;
the bride, with a hoarse, deep voice. 'It is&#xD;
you who 'havekillad my child!'&#xD;
Having said this, the bereaved father co-&#xD;
vered the inanimate corpse with kisses and&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
Regin~t uttered a cry of horror, and with&#xD;
her' hand pushed away the dead little one&#xD;
preserfted to her; then. as she staggered&#xD;
'badkwards, she stammered-&#xD;
'The man is mad-turn him out!'&#xD;
The spectators of this mournfully inter-&#xD;
esting scene were petrified with astonishment.&#xD;
A' dead silence prevailed as they contemplat-&#xD;
ed the unhappy parent and the strangely-ac-&#xD;
cused bride.&#xD;
The three brothers alone looked elsewhere.'&#xD;
Their angry regards were simultaneously&#xD;
'turned upon~Antoine. Before the mute ap-&#xD;
peal, th&amp;amp; dwarf was confused, pale, and&#xD;
guilty-looking.&#xD;
As for the assemblage of the lofty and&#xD;
high-born, it may well be supposed that they,&#xD;
being ignorant of the love on one side and&#xD;
aversion on the other, were unable to con-&#xD;
ceive 'any grounds of accusation.&#xD;
Pierre Aubin, the game-keeper, seemed by&#xD;
his social position so far removed from the&#xD;
beautiful and aristocratic bride, that no ac-&#xD;
quaintance or 'cause of hatred could be ima-&#xD;
gined to actuate her to such a crime.&#xD;
The actual belief that the noble lady's&#xD;
pride and self-respect would necessarily have&#xD;
kept her aloof from any familiarity with a&#xD;
man in his station, made them accept the few&#xD;
words that had escaped her as the true ex-&#xD;
planation o'f the melancholy and incredible&#xD;
assertion of her guilt.&#xD;
'He is mad I' she had said, in reply to the&#xD;
grave charge of murder; and many believe&#xD;
this to be the case.&#xD;
However, in the opinion of some of the&#xD;
company, Regina appeared more surprised&#xD;
than indignant~ She had denied the charge,&#xD;
but not with' the energy of voice and look&#xD;
that might have been expected from an inno-&#xD;
cent person; whilst the tone and manneY of&#xD;
her ~ccusei had, the unfaltering imnpress~ of&#xD;
truth and confidence.&#xD;
,Opinions were divided ho~v to treat the&#xD;

'Justice shall be done to every one,' was&#xD;
the emphatic reply of the magistrate, who,&#xD;
nevertheless, placed no faith in the shocking&#xD;

'rThanks, kind sir. After this promise, :1&#xD;

sacred obligation to disclose the truth. But&#xD;
would it not he the truth to confess yourself&#xD;

by the accusation of your accomplice, Clo-&#xD;
domir?'&#xD;
'Clotlomir? Who is he, sir? I assure&#xD;
you I never heard of him until you mention-&#xD;
ed the name!' said Pierre.&#xD;
The truth was, that the trial at Beauvais&#xD;
and its results, had not reached the ears ef&#xD;
the game-keeper in his seclusion at Chamecy,&#xD;
and Decadi, when warning him to escape,&#xD;
had, in his hurry, said nothing about Gb-&#xD;
domir.&#xD;
'You inquire who Clodornir is V rejoiced&#xD;
the' magistrate. 'Well, he is the man 'with&#xD;
~hom you ~vent to Fleurines on 'the sixth day&#xD;

"The sixth of November?' repeated Pierre&#xD;
eagerly. 'I could not have been at ~'leurinc~&#xD;
on that day. This I can prove.'&#xD;
- 'How ?-by what means?'&#xD;
'Let me be confronted with Madame de&#xD;
Gazeran I-and she shall acknowledge that I&#xD;
was here-a prisoner in this very castle at&#xD;
that identical time !'&#xD;
must remark, that what you assert is&#xD;
highly improbable.'&#xD;
'Nevertheless, it is the truth. I accuse&#xD;
no one. I am not breaking my o~ith! said&#xD;
Pierre, looking significantly at the legitimate&#xD;
sons of his father. 'I will not tell how er&#xD;
by whom I was brought to Gazeran; but I&#xD;
may declare that I was here, in confinement,&#xD;
at that date; and I invoke the testimony of&#xD;
Aladame de' Labourdilliere, since it seems&#xD;
,tkat now is the name of the Lady of Gazftan.&#xD;
I beseech you to consult her, Mr Sime'on. [,&#xD;
&#xD;
expect she will ~ot deny' the fact.'&#xD;
We shall see,' replied the magistrate&#xD;
who thought that Pierre had ~become corn&#xD;
pletely crazy by the murder of his child, am&#xD;
therefore spoke compassionately to him.-&#xD;
Then apologizing to the brothers for having&#xD;
disturbed theni hy the arrest, prepared to&#xD;

The brothei~s, seeing they were about t&#xD;
have Pierre Aubiti removed oat of thei,&#xD;
way, and firmly entangled in the meshes o.&#xD;
the law, expressed hypocriti&amp;amp;al pity for th~&#xD;
poor deluded man; and Antoin~, eager t&#xD;
account for th~ murder, ventured to say,-&#xD;
''~'he poor devil who accuses every body~&#xD;
has, perhaps, in a fit of insane frenzy, him.&#xD;
self been the death of die little innocent&#xD;
whose fate ho now so pathetically bemoans.'&#xD;
'Horrid wretch! Dare you say that I&#xD;
could kill my own sweet Philiberte?' shouted&#xD;
Pierre, trembling with rage, and with a vio-&#xD;
lent effl~rt escaping from his guards, and rush~&#xD;

At this instant, Regina, uneasy at the long&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
IT must be granted, that the victim of so&#xD;
much persecution, the unfortunate game-&#xD;
keeper, judgiug from the past, might well be-&#xD;
lieve Regina capable of any ~ct of violence&#xD;
and cruelty; yet in the present .instance he&#xD;
wronged her.&#xD;
This crime was committed by Antoine, al-&#xD;
though it 'was not premeditated on his part.&#xD;
His only object was to delay Pierre one day&#xD;
longer at Chamecy, in order to secure his&#xD;
arrest.&#xD;
The discovery of the ehest in the 'pavilion&#xD;
-sepulchre having, as already noticed, re*&#xD;
moved the superstitious dread of the denun-&#xD;
ciation of the paper found in the closet, re-&#xD;
newed the hostile feelings of the brothers&#xD;
against Pierre, whose death they now again&#xD;
desired.&#xD;
Antoine, who doubly hated the game-keep..&#xD;
er as the beloved of Regina, was even more&#xD;
desirous than Honore that this man should&#xD;
perish on the scaffold as an incendiary, lie&#xD;
therefore determined-to destroy the effect of&#xD;
the warning that had been sent to Pierre to&#xD;
escape, by stealing the child and th~rs de-&#xD;
'tainiig the father in the ieighborftood., -&#xD;
-It will now be understood #ho was the&#xD;

high enough to screen him from the 5ig~tf~t&#xD;
the gardener who w~is at work, whew~ the&#xD;
hapless infant, frightened at the stranger's iii.&#xD;
f looks, began to scream.. -&#xD;
The gardener raised his head at the ~OJiJI~,&#xD;
and Antoine heard l~is heavy steps 4pproacJ~-&#xD;
ing. He stepped back, and hid behind a&#xD;
wall, then, to still the 'cries of the ehi4d~ J~e&#xD;
* sat down on the gro.uud and Inid~ her acr~qs&#xD;
his knees. With one hand he ru~lely gra~pe~&#xD;
its tender throat1 and, with the other,'he&#xD;
pressed heavily on its little mouth.&#xD;
The child became siler~t, for it had e~sed&#xD;

he feared detection. Therefore, hidix~&#xD;
under his cloak, he returned to tha lio&amp;amp;ise,&#xD;
and 'laid it by the side of the still sleeping&#xD;
Cecile.&#xD;
It was a bold step to vanttire back wi4i&#xD;
the inanimate babe, but Antoine was&#xD;
turous in crime, and had faith that his eyil&#xD;
genius would not' desert him. Indeed, every&#xD;
thing seemed to be favorable to the s'4c~e~&#xD;
of his wickedness: the lengthened sleej~of&#xD;

I'Iumbled, scorned, and disbelieved by&#xD;

"No, sir; no such thing. It still exists.'&#xD;
'Does it?'&#xD;
'Yes'; I am sure of it.'&#xD;
'Why not produce it, then? or do you&#xD;
mean ~o say you do not know where it is 'P&#xD;
'There, fortunately, you are mistaken,&#xD;
Mr. SimerWm I gan tell where it may be&#xD;

dungeon, in the second dungeon to which I&#xD;
was transferred. .1 put it there for safety&#xD;
intending to carry it away with me if ever I&#xD;
should leave t~e castle alive. But my flight&#xD;
was so sudden, and attended with such hci-&#xD;
dents, that, when leaving my terrible prison,&#xD;
I did not think of the letter-I only thought&#xD;
of preserving my life and regaining liberty.'&#xD;
rI~he Messieurs de Labourdilliere had not&#xD;
followed the bride, wishing to see their enemy&#xD;
fairly in custody and removed from the pre-&#xD;
mises; and on hearing Pierre's assertions&#xD;
they looked at each other in consternation.&#xD;
The worthy and humane mnagist rate, busied&#xD;
with turning over in his 'mind the strar;~&#xD;
charges of the game-keeper, did not observe&#xD;
their troubled mien, as he replied to the&#xD;
prisoner,-&#xD;
'Admitting that what yoy say is true, my&#xD;
poor fellow, it seems very unlikely you should-&#xD;
'leave so important a paper behind you, in a&#xD;
castle where, according tO your account, you&#xD;
were imprisoned.' -&#xD;
"It would appear quite natural, sir, if I&#xD;
might tell under what circumstances I escap-&#xD;
eel from mn~y dungeon; but I must not, I ought&#xD;
not, I 'cannot reveal.'&#xD;
Mr. Simeron, riot knowing what to think&#xD;
&#xD;
of such contradictory statements, turned t.&#xD;
Honored, and inquired, saying,-:&#xD;
'What am I to make of this 'I'&#xD;
'Truly, this is a pretty question to addres~&#xD;
to me, sir!' was the bridegroom's sarcastic&#xD;
reply. 'What must you believe respectjn~&#xD;
the accusation against my wife? Has nol&#xD;
every bad action' some powerful motive 01&#xD;
interest to instigate its commission? Now&#xD;
what motive or reason could the lofty Regina&#xD;
de Gazeran have had for persecuting Pierre&#xD;
Aubin, the game-keeper?'&#xD;
'Besides,' added William,' if the shadow&#xD;
of a doubt could exist, our sister-in-law will&#xD;
doubtless consider it her duty to throw open&#xD;
the interior of the castle to the examination&#xD;
of the officers-of justice.'&#xD;
The magistrate being satisfied, was about&#xD;
to withdraw, when 'Pierre again earnestly im-&#xD;
plored him td make instant search.&#xD;
'Oh, sir, if you go not at once and seize&#xD;
upon this precious letter, it will have disap-&#xD;
peared ere to-morrow, and I shall be ruined.&#xD;
I demand, in justice, to be taken at o'ce to&#xD;
the subterranean dungeons of this castle. I&#xD;
will show you the letter where I have told&#xD;
you I buried it.'&#xD;
The subterranean dungeons!' thought-&#xD;
fully repeated Mr. Simeron, aloud. 'How&#xD;
comes he to know that there are any such&#xD;
here?'&#xD;
'Pqrbleu I' sneered Antoine; 'there is&#xD;
nothing strati ge about that, seeing Pierre is,&#xD;
as it were, one of the household of Gazeran&#xD;
-"--he was game-keeper when the old lord was&#xD;
alive.'&#xD;
'Yes,' added James; 'he had every op.&#xD;
portuatty, as a domestic of the late lord, to&#xD;
become, in the execution of his master's&#xD;
orders, thoroughly acquainted with the secret&#xD;
places of the castle.'&#xD;
'Ah !-indeed! Then how happened it&#xD;
that Madame de Labourdilliere disclaimed all&#xD;
knowledge of the man?'&#xD;
'Sir, do you mean to cross-questioii us?'&#xD;
said William, haughtily.&#xD;
'Certainly; it is my right and my duty to&#xD;
do so,? was the firm rejoinder of the magis-&#xD;
trate.&#xD;
'It is very plain, that, in your official ca~&#xD;
paucity, you are not u~ed to dealing with&#xD;
honorable men,' said James, in a loud voice.&#xD;
"Silenc~; you will spoil all,' whispered&#xD;
Honore.&#xD;
'Gentlemen,' continued Mr. Simeron, 'the&#xD;
&#xD;
unseemly tone of your remarks, ~nd your.&#xD;
very improper manner. of treating n~e haves'&#xD;
induced an 'alteration of my views, and iii.'&#xD;

has demanded, shall take place in nu~dia~e 4,..&#xD;

was radiant with joyful hope.&#xD;
'Certainly; you shall go with us to 'mdi--&#xD;
cate the spot.'&#xD;
Torches were instantly brought, a~d whilst&#xD;
Regina, all impatience and anxiety was com-&#xD;
pelling herself to act the apparently uncon-&#xD;

Labourdilliere to carry out the purpose for&#xD;
which he had penetrated thus hazardously&#xD;
to the late prison of Pierre, was not in the&#xD;

CII APTER XVII.&#xD;
Whilst on the one han&amp;amp;Pierre Aubin, a&#xD;
prey to sorrow and despair, was being con-&#xD;
ducted by the Gendarmerie, ~o the prison at&#xD;
Senlis, and Antoine* de Labourdilliere was&#xD;
fighting his xv~iy to the dungeon, as describe~&#xD;
ed in the last ch~ipter, the ball-room in the&#xD;
castle of Gizerai~ had resumed its gaiety,&#xD;
the music resounded as before the embarras-&#xD;
sing interruption,, and the company assembled&#xD;
to celebrate the nuptials, returned with fresh&#xD;
vigor and animation to the festivities of the&#xD;
night.&#xD;
Madame de Labourdillere having been in-&#xD;
formed of the inability of the game-keeper to&#xD;
find the letter, and of his departure for a jail,&#xD;
recovered her self-possession, and by her&#xD;
flow, of spirits, grac~, urbanity and beauty,&#xD;
attracted the attention, and commanded the&#xD;
admiration of her numerous and- distinguish-&#xD;
ccl guests.&#xD;
Notwithstanding this appearance of ease&#xD;
and unconcern, Regina felt the time long&#xD;
until she was at liberty to retire. -&#xD;
At length the moment arrived when Re-&#xD;
gina could set abou*he important undertak-&#xD;
ing, on the success of which depended her&#xD;
dignity, her reputation,, her honor!&#xD;
With a lamp in one hand, and the keys&#xD;
she required i0 the other, this bold woman&#xD;
made her m'duiight-journey. through the sub-&#xD;
terraneous intricacies which led to the vault&#xD;
in which was concealed the imprudent avow-&#xD;
al of her guilty and scandulous passion. This&#xD;
tell tale paper she was about to recover, and&#xD;
it. destroyed, nothing would he left to sus-&#xD;
tain the blighting imputations of Pierre.'&#xD;
Thus thought Regina, who knew not that&#xD;
to recover, it would be requisite to ptrrchaso it&#xD;
With a shudder of inward exultation she&#xD;
applied the key to the lock of the secret&#xD;
dungeon in which she had for so long a time&#xD;
immured the- man who had despised;and re-&#xD;
jected, her love. Still she hesitated an in-&#xD;
stant, before opening the dood, to cast a look&#xD;
hehing, in orded to ascertain . whether any&#xD;
one had followed her.&#xD;
It was of Honore that Regina thought;&#xD;
and yet why should she dread his espio-&#xD;
nage or presence? Was he not- informed&#xD;
&#xD;
of the past? Had ~sha not' that - e~mening,&#xD;
even, adm~tt~d her former love? - - - -'&#xD;
This was perfectly, true, nevertheless4 Re.&#xD;
gina did not wish the love-letter to fall into~t~&#xD;
hands of her husband. She - intended to t9U&#xD;
him in the first instance that~ she had not.&#xD;
been able to find it; and to reserve to hera&#xD;
self the power of using it at a future period,&#xD;
according -to circumstances-either to put-&#xD;
an end to the persecution of Pierre 'by Rn.&#xD;
nore-or in case the former, by fresh insults&#xD;
and humiliating disclosures, should drive her&#xD;
to extremities, to produce this galling epis*le&#xD;
as a means of causing the death of the game,&#xD;
keeper through the invitation of her husband. -&#xD;
Being satisfied that she, was alone ip the&#xD;
corridor, Regina entered the cell aud' fI~w&#xD;
towards the spot where she expected to fipd&#xD;

Instantly she recoiled with horroi,'shriel~-&#xD;

tfier-in.isw. Without staying to puzzle 'her-&#xD;
self about this strange matter, she hurried to&#xD;
the corner where the letter was said to have&#xD;
been, Plainly she saw that it had been'but&#xD;
r&amp;amp;~ent1y removed, the earth was fresh that&#xD;
had, covered it, and appeared beyond doubt&#xD;
to 'have just been scratched out.&#xD;
Yes, indeed, but a few minutes 'previous,&#xD;
Antoine had held it ii~ his frenzied fingers,&#xD;
a~i exulted at the anticipation of his triumph&#xD;
over his coveted -idol-and yet the paper&#xD;
hi~d vanished, and he seemed maniac.&#xD;
How this had hiippened.~-what had taken&#xD;
pizice-who had parried off the missing let-&#xD;
ter'~on which so much depended-remained&#xD;
for the time an impenetrable mystery.&#xD;
Tte~ina, in this dile~nma, was obliged to&#xD;
acquaint her husband immediately with a&#xD;
true statement 'of her adventure in the dun-&#xD;
g~ibn, and he, with his brothers, hurried down&#xD;
t~ remove the miserable dwarf, who was at&#xD;
or~ce carefully escorted to Valganest.&#xD;
'1*'or eigbt days and nights Antoine was in&#xD;
a raging fever, and completely delirious, ta-&#xD;
ving ineessently about-' the letter' and 'the&#xD;
phantom!'&#xD;
I~uring the whole' of this time, one or&#xD;
other of the brothers, kept vigilant watch&#xD;
and guard at his 'bedside. The disappear-&#xD;
ani~e'of the Fetter was a constant source of&#xD;
uneasiness to them, for whilst it would esta-&#xD;
bhish ,the~ innocence of Pierre Aubiri, it&#xD;
wbuid,' as we have seen, as effectually dis-&#xD;
grace the lady who had become the wife of&#xD;
oil~ of the aristocrat brotkei's, and of course&#xD;
ttr6 sister-in-law-of the rest.&#xD;
li was impossible for them, in the mean&#xD;
time, to 'obtain any clue as the person who&#xD;
had ~bstra&amp;amp;ted the letter,' n~ light having&#xD;
been thrown on the subject. by' the dw~irf&#xD;
*ho could only say- ' ' '&#xD;
'It was he !-It was the phantom! He&#xD;
todc 'the letter!' ' ' -&#xD;
liav'iizg made these exclamation~ the deli-'&#xD;
rious wretch would, in his paroxisms, refer to&#xD;
the'xnurder of their father, and the chest that&#xD;
was ernploy~d to coneal~his remains.&#xD;
- These dreadful revelations were ~f too&#xD;
~ei~,u~ a' nature to be allowed to reach other&#xD;
ears kiian their' owii, therefore the' brothers&#xD;
&#xD;
took the precaution' riot to allow any one&#xD;
else to enter -the sick man's chamber under&#xD;
any-pretence.                 S        *&#xD;
Once, and once only, had they departed&#xD;
from this rule. Honor had called in a doc-&#xD;
tor to see his brother!&#xD;
Doctor Pascal 'ivas eminently successful&#xD;
in his profession,' and was highly esteemed,&#xD;
throughout a large extent of country, by&#xD;
high and low, to whom he devoted his rare&#xD;
skill and care indiscriminately. Thus he&#xD;
waS a favorite every where, ,and did not fail&#xD;
on all occasions, save one, to be well and&#xD;
cordially rec4ved wherever his valuable ser-&#xD;
vices were required.&#xD;
The ezc.~ption, to this universal~ welcome,&#xD;
occurred to Valganest, on the occasion of&#xD;
his calling to pay a second visit to Antoine.&#xD;
James-'who had giving his opinion, that&#xD;
it was better to allow the fever to take its&#xD;
course, should it even carry off their brother,&#xD;
than admit any one to see him whilst thus&#xD;
raving-had encountered doctor Pascal, and&#xD;
refused him admittance to his patient. The&#xD;
doctor insisted, an altercation ensued. From&#xD;
being rude, James became absolutely inso-&#xD;
lent, and ended by imperatively dismissing&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Immediately after, James entered the (oom&#xD;
where William and Honore were sitting at&#xD;
the bedside of Antoine. ~'Iis' face was still'&#xD;
flushed, and the traces of his 'late anger were&#xD;
visible.&#xD;
'Well, James, what is the 'matter? Who&#xD;
has been vexing you?' asked his elder bro-&#xD;
ther, who had indistinctly heatd the sounds&#xD;
of wrath.&#xD;
'It was that rascally doctor, who would&#xD;
come in here~wh'ether or no. in vain I tried,&#xD;
bysoft words, to dissuade him, saying it was&#xD;
too early-, etc. He replied that 'a doctor&#xD;
mus't consult the state of his patient, and 'not&#xD;
the' time 'of day. At last I lost all patience&#xD;
with hirri, I had a great mind to pitch him&#xD;
out of the window.'&#xD;
'Gracidus Heavens l exclaimed the ever&#xD;
timid Honore;-' I hope you did nothing of&#xD;
th~ kind.' -&#xD;
~ Miorbien, I almost regret that I did not.' -&#xD;
'You would have done very wrong. I&#xD;
think as you 'dothat it was a~n unwise thing&#xD;
on our part to call in the' doctor, because&#xD;
Antoine 'babbled worse than ever, arid there&#xD;
is no knowing what suspicions it might cre-&#xD;
ate, nevertheless, the doctor ought not te&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
RE~!N~A.&#xD;
&#xD;
have been dismissed without the greatest po.&#xD;
likeness and precaution.&#xD;
Thus said William-- and ftegina's husband&#xD;
added-&#xD;
Yes, indeed, it becomes us, above all&#xD;
things, to try and raise up friends.'&#xD;
A That, I think, is not our fate ' replied&#xD;
James,' in proof of which, know that the ac-&#xD;
cused doctor dared almost to threaten us.'&#xD;
To threaten? With what? What does&#xD;
he know? What ~n lie do to us? Surely&#xD;
you have not compromised?'&#xD;
'Why, Honore you are always a fraid,"&#xD;
remarked William. ' What can signjly, the&#xD;
words or actions of this Esculapius? I va-&#xD;
lue them not a pin. But though I am 'not&#xD;
uneasy about so trifling a matter, I should&#xD;
like to know what the man threatened.'&#xD;
He muttered, that 'he was driven away&#xD;
from Valganest because he was attending&#xD;
Cecile, the wife of Pierre Aubiii, whom he&#xD;
called our victim,' said James, carelessly,&#xD;
and he continued-&#xD;
'.It appears, that old Decadi Robert, the&#xD;
father ot' this woman, is straining every nerve&#xD;
to substantiate the' innocence of his son-in-&#xD;
law. Doctor Pascal also told me that this&#xD;
devil of a Decadi asserts that we well know&#xD;
that Pierre is not guilty, and that we could&#xD;
prove it, only that the whole of us have&#xD;
sworn the destruction of the gdme-keeper of&#xD;
Brasseuse.'&#xD;
Honored shuddered at each word, and&#xD;
William, who had become uneasy, and very&#xD;
attentive, asked his brother- -&#xD;
'Did doctor Pascal say nothing at all a-&#xD;
bout Antoine then?'&#xD;
Oh yes, but I- had nearly forgotten it, for in&#xD;
truth I did not pay much heed to his imper-&#xD;
tinence. He said we were afraid to let him&#xD;
approach the sick man on account of the re-&#xD;
velations which he was making under the in-&#xD;
fluencc of lever. In short, in his rage at&#xD;
being turned out of doors-he called ot4,&#xD;
when beyond my reach, something about&#xD;
the law-that the law knew .9othirig about&#xD;
nobility, or gentry, or commoners, that 'the&#xD;
only distinction in i~s sight was guilt or in~'&#xD;
nocence.'&#xD;
'God help us, can this doctor know ?'-&#xD;
exclaimed ilonore, in utter dismay.&#xD;
'What can he, know, you frightened fel-&#xD;
low, except flying, reports? Had he the&#xD;
slightest suspicion of the truth, he would n~f&#xD;
have scrupled to have cast it up to me in his&#xD;
&#xD;
passiqn-and then gentlemen Ithink it would&#xD;
have been un~Vise to have allowed him to leave&#xD;
Valganest in a hurry.'&#xD;
'I think, with James, that doctor Pasca1~ a,&#xD;
only an echo of the family of Decadi Robert&#xD;
by whom we need not expect to be held W&#xD;
the order of sanctity. Any evil that the)r&#xD;
may say of us can only be of little impor-&#xD;
tance. Pierre Aubin, denounced as an iu.~&#xD;
cendiary, has assumed the 1)ositiofl of ac~ii.&#xD;
ser of Regina. Nowas Regina has become&#xD;
allied to us, so long as the accusation ~'&#xD;
against her remains unproved, we can not&#xD;
'I'&#xD;
f~r from this calumny.'&#xD;
it is in vain to talk so,' replied Honore7.&#xD;
'I am not satisfied. James was too hasty.&#xD;
Lie ought not to have turned out the doctor&#xD;
so unceremoniously.'&#xD;
'Say rather that we ought never t~ have&#xD;
sent for him,'&#xD;
'Then perhaps Antoine would not be 'a--&#xD;
live at this time,' remarked William.&#xD;
'This' may be 'true,' continued Honore,&#xD;
nevertheless it would haw~ been the moat&#xD;
prudent course for us to have pursued.'&#xD;
£ Let us be (lone with this. Wh~t I ~li~&#xD;
I do not regret,' said James, and to put an&#xD;
end to the conversation, he walked out of&#xD;
the sick room.&#xD;
At breakfast time James re-appeared,&#xD;
but he did not appear as easy and satisfied&#xD;
as when he had left them. He hel~1 in hi~&#xD;
hand a newspaper, folded in i~ wrapp&amp;amp;~tl~&#xD;
address on which he read, with evident sur~.&#xD;
prise, and then exclaimed-&#xD;
'How long have you been a subscriti~r&#xD;
to the ' Propagateur de L' Oirse' H6nore~'&#xD;
I a subscriber indeed?   Never+i~~r&#xD;
shame - a radical paper I' nerv~p~ly, r~&#xD;
monstrated he. But why the question. Is&#xD;

Assuredly l'&#xD;
'The devil it is. What can this ~&#xD;

'For proof?' growled James, ' Then&#xD;
seek it!'&#xD;
'As a first step, I demand the key of the&#xD;
family burial-vault.'&#xD;
'The key of the tomb of our family? eja-&#xD;
culated Honore, with evident fear and horror.&#xD;
'It shall never be given up. The sepulchre&#xD;
of the Labourdillieres shtdl not be profaned&#xD;
without passing over my dead body,' furious-&#xD;
ly exclaimed Honore.'&#xD;
'In the name of the law I insist upon your&#xD;
producing this key instantly,' said the magis-&#xD;
t~ate, most peremptorily:&#xD;
'No magistrate can allow such' a violation&#xD;
-it is sacrilege.'&#xD;
'The door must 'be opened without fur-&#xD;
ther delay.'&#xD;
Finding opposition useless, Honore or-&#xD;
dered Bartholomew to unlock the entrance&#xD;
to the tomb.&#xD;
Dreadful was the suspense, and ominous&#xD;
the sullen silence ! At length heavy steps&#xD;
are heard ascending the stairs.&#xD;
'Oh, my God, they are bringing the fatal&#xD;
chest!' staid Honore to his brothers, and his&#xD;
face became livid and ghastly.&#xD;
Too surely, borne by four gendarmes, the&#xD;
dreadful chest was brought into the room,&#xD;
and set down in the middle of the floor.&#xD;
'Do you recognize this chest, inquired&#xD;
Mr. Simeron of them, but he 'received no&#xD;
reply.'&#xD;
'Then we will proceed to open it.&#xD;

to burst open the lid of this large, heavy,&#xD;

'Se'arcely had they struck the first blow,&#xD;
when the work was arrested, by the sudden&#xD;
entrance of a stranger.&#xD;
Ths instant that the brothers caught sight&#xD;
of this man, they simultaneously uttered a&#xD;
shout of surprise and aifright.&#xD;
Decadi'Rol~ert seemed to recognize the&#xD;
new comer also-and he, too, shouted, but&#xD;
it was with delight-and he sprang instantly&#xD;
- forward, and seizing the stranger's hands, he~&#xD;
kissed them, and bathed them with the tears&#xD;
of joy.&#xD;
At this loud noise and fresh commotion,&#xD;
Antoine once again raised himself up, and&#xD;
catching sight of the unexpected visitor-he&#xD;
pointed at him with his attenuated fingers-&#xD;
and with the most sp~alling 'ook of horror,&#xD;
he exclaimed-&#xD;
&#xD;
'It is he!' l7hepharztom!'&#xD;
As the dwarf pronounced these words, he&#xD;
fell backwasds, gave a last groan, and ex-,&#xD;
pired!!&#xD;
'Walking up to the bed', 'the new-coriier&#xD;
took hold of the hand of the corpse,' and&#xD;
pressing it with emotion, exclaimed-&#xD;
'My son! OIimyson!'&#xD;
Then turning ~to the bewildered specia.&#xD;
tors of the extraordinary scene, this person&#xD;
thus 'addressed them-.&#xD;
'Gentlemen, I have learned that my sons&#xD;
were accused for Parricide-therefore am I&#xD;
here. .0ehold 'me I-Recognise me !-I am&#xD;
Major Seignerolles-or, rather, lam Etien~c&#xD;

CHAPI'ER XIX.&#xD;
As there could be no doubt ~f the existencs~&#xD;
or identity of Major Seignerolles, the magis.~&#xD;
trate and his suite soon took their departure.&#xD;
There, in the chamber of the cltty~.coM&#xD;
dwarf, the brothers stood, self-condemned&#xD;
and utterly humiliated!&#xD;
The father's heart had compassion, 'even&#xD;
for his wicked children, whom h~ m9utned&#xD;
with bitter sorrow-and for a'time all Were&#xD;
silent.&#xD;
Through the opportune appearance of tiv~&#xD;
Major, that is, Etienne de Labourdillere, his&#xD;
sons were preserved from public punishnient,&#xD;
-but not from the disgrace of having l*e-&#xD;
meditated the crime, which the dying wtn~ds&#xD;
of Anoine proved his belief had been&#xD;
treated.                  '        prp&#xD;
Pierre Aubin was cleared from the 'stigma&#xD;

danger that menaced his life, when it Was&#xD;

Decade, however, the old soldier, and lie&#xD;
alone, seemed tofeel pleasuraNe feelings on&#xD;

and to this, all 1istene~d with attention. '&#xD;

;not onI~y from condiga punishment, but, I&#xD;
Would fain hope, from the~pangs of remorse.'&#xD;
You speak truly, father!' said Honore, ti-&#xD;
midly. 'Indeed we have known no peace&#xD;

Francois re~appear~d from your chamber,&#xD;
wounded and bleeding-with, as we believ-&#xD;

Honor paused, and shuddered at the re-&#xD;
collection; and William added-&#xD;
~ We heard a fearful struggle, too, as it&#xD;
Rpppared.'&#xD;
'I will relate what occurred,' said Etienne&#xD;
* de Labourdilliere-&#xD;
' When Francois entered my apartment,&#xD;
(saw from his livid look, and the desperate&#xD;
exression ot~his countenance, that his pcir-&#xD;
r.pose wasto put an end. to my existence,&#xD;

a burthen to them. I saw also that he was&#xD;

~ornpunotions about the dreadful deedhe had&#xD;
4ndertaken to perform, and resolving to&#xD;
8pare him the certain remorse that would as-&#xD;
j~uredly follow and avenge such a crime, I&#xD;
said-&#xD;
'Beware! I am armed! Approach not a&#xD;
step nearer at your peril I'&#xD;
'Disregarding my warning, Francois rush-&#xD;
e$ upon me, and the dagger which I' had&#xD;
drawn to protect myself,~and deter him, un-&#xD;
mte~nipnally wounded him. I threw the wea.~&#xD;

sary, determined, it' possible, to overpower,&#xD;

his salvation.&#xD;

were enfeebled by the wickedness of his ob-&#xD;
ject.&#xD;
When I had mastered and pinioned my&#xD;
unhappy son, 1 implored him to listen to me.&#xD;
~ assured him, that notwithstanding this out-&#xD;
rage, he was too dear for me t&amp;amp; h~rm, and I&#xD;
placed his conduct in such a light as drew&#xD;
tears from the eyes~ of both of us.&#xD;
&#xD;
"What shall J do t6 make atonement for&#xD;
thjs~ sin, oh my father,~ said he, penitentially.&#xD;
You must allow your brothers to believe&#xD;
that you accomplished your mission. To&#xD;
keep up this appearance, we will bring out&#xD;
that chest, which you can privately fill with&#xD;
stones, at your leisure, and you will persuade&#xD;
them that you have put my mangled corpse&#xD;
into it, as you doubtless intended.'&#xD;
,'The horn which your brother were&#xD;
sounding down stairs, in order, I suppose, to&#xD;
drown my cries, and which fortunately hin-&#xD;
dered their hearing your appeal to them for&#xD;
aid-has ceased, we will therefore make a&#xD;
noise, as if scuffling, which will account for&#xD;
your sound.&#xD;
Obey m~,'I continued, and I will be as&#xD;
though dead/to you all in future, as much so&#xD;
as if I really were an inanimate occupant of&#xD;
that chest, whose very sight, I prophesy, will&#xD;
be torture to your brothers. Never shall I&#xD;
re-appear unless to save or serve! On these&#xD;
terms he went. down unstained by a father's&#xD;
blood.&#xD;
Alas! it is too true-but I forgive him,&#xD;
and Pierre also will pardon him, I am sure.'&#xD;
~Antoine is gope to render his final ac-&#xD;
count,' said William, solemnly, ' Let us not&#xD;
judge the departed. As for me, I will hide&#xD;
my shame within a cloister's walls! To-mor.&#xD;
row I will take refuge from poverty and con-&#xD;
tempt in the solitude of the great Cliatreuse&#xD;
of Grenoble.'&#xD;
'I will accompany you wherever you go,&#xD;
said James, ' we4inave never yet been sepa-&#xD;
rated, and I am sick of a world where every&#xD;
thing is t~mrned topsy turvy. There will be&#xD;
none but upstarts in high places soon, I ama&#xD;
weary of this miserable state of things, .1 will,&#xD;
with you, withdraw from the world.'&#xD;
Having thus given vent to his spleen, James&#xD;
inquired of his brother Honore what he&#xD;
meant to do?&#xD;
'Valganest is no place for ~me,' he replied,&#xD;
'I am no longer it~ lord-I will at once leave&#xD;
it, and give place to the present Marquis,&#xD;
Etienne-Ae Labourdilliere, whose rank and&#xD;
title none can dispute.'&#xD;
Whither will you turni your steps?'&#xD;
I must, without delay, hie to Gazeran, to&#xD;
break 'this, intellig~hce to Regina, and consult&#xD;
with her about our fttttmre mov~nicnts. You&#xD;
know that being married, I am n~t fr~e to act&#xD;
so independently, as you, brother~4' he a~ded,&#xD;
noticing their looks of surprise.&#xD;
&#xD;
A surely you will not live with her after the&#xD;
public are aware of her prior, love and in~&#xD;
trigues?'&#xD;
~It is rather embarrassing and unpleasat~t,&#xD;
but' doubtless some means may ~e found to&#xD;
hush up the matter and 'avoid scandal. My&#xD;
wife is rich, young, noble 4n4 beautiful; we&#xD;
may make some kind of a compromise; for I&#xD;
am almost entirely dependent on her.'&#xD;
Having thus explained his views, Honore&#xD;
ordered his horse, add taking leave o~' his&#xD;
forgiving parent with more cordiality and&#xD;
good feeling than he had ever before express-&#xD;
ed or felt, he left the castle of his ancestors&#xD;
for ever.&#xD;
On arriving at Gazeran, he found that Re&#xD;
gina had fled from thence on the day follow&#xD;
ing the announcement of the newspaper Cod-&#xD;
cerning the discovery of the fatal letter.&#xD;
It appeared that she had hurried to Paris,.&#xD;
settled her afThirs with the utmost dispatch,&#xD;
and with a large amount in cash an~d jewels,&#xD;
had proceeded to a seaport, whence she em-&#xD;
barked on board a vessel bound for the&#xD;
Brazils.&#xD;
All this the determined spirit of the woman&#xD;
had infected, while the brothers were supinely&#xD;
watching the progress of events, py the bed&#xD;
side of th~ir conscience-stricken brother.&#xD;
Regina left a letter for ~her husband, in&#xD;
which she stated her reasons for taking the&#xD;
step of expatriating herself without consulting&#xD;
him Thus 'she skilfully avoided the un-&#xD;
pleasant sce~ws which she well knew would&#xD;
be inevitable if she remains. The letter&#xD;
concluded in these words,-&#xD;
"It' you really love me, Honore, and choose&#xD;
to follow as soon as your affairs in France&#xD;
can be arranged-I promise, sacredly, you&#xD;
shall. htve no reason to regret having made&#xD;
Regina do Gazeran your wife, if the most&#xD;
complete devotion and the strictest constancy&#xD;
with 'a never failing desire to please on my&#xD;
part can secure your happiness.'&#xD;
Honor did not hesitate. He had no&#xD;
longer any estate to embarrass his move~&#xD;
ments, and but little property of any kind.&#xD;
He sailed-but the vessel did not reach its&#xD;
destination and he was never more heard&#xD;
of!&#xD;
The other brothers put their intentions into&#xD;
practise, but, ore their noviciate concluded,&#xD;
a contagions fever, sweeping with destructive&#xD;
fury through the cloistered cells, assailed life;&#xD;
without allowing preparation for death, and&#xD;
&#xD;
speedily tI~ey were no more.&#xD;
None but Etienne de Labourdi1lier~, thJ&#xD;
aggrieved father, and Pierre Aubin, the di*~ 2&#xD;
owned~ and persecuted brother, were round&#xD;
to regret the extinction of tke~ aristni*~r~&#xD;
brothers.'&#xD;
But little now remains to relate, thQugh&#xD;
that little can not well remain untohi.&#xD;
Ttm~ fortune of the game-keeper of t~6&#xD;
forest of Brasseuse, took a new and 'happy&#xD;
turn from the date of his acquittal, an~l he&#xD;
was looked upon as a noble martyr 'to p~rse.'&#xD;
caution and tyranny, and a pattern of forb~ar~.&#xD;
ance and hpnor, in thathe had not betr~.yed&#xD;
those who had so shamefully ill-treated him.&#xD;
It may readily be surmised, by the reader,&#xD;
who was the (to her unkno~vn) protector of&#xD;
Cecile-and why Pierre was so delighted'to&#xD;
see that old man on the nigljtt of his es4ape&#xD;
i'rom the woodman's burning hut.&#xD;
In Vilvert, had the supposed victim ~f&#xD;
par~'icides, remained in seclusion, watchitig&#xD;
over the lives of his children. He had. ob-&#xD;
tamed a promise from Pierre, not to prosef~ute&#xD;
or accuse the aristoc~i'at brothers, when he&#xD;
received him on his escape from G~zera~i&#xD;
dungeons.&#xD;
This sacred promise it was that caused the&#xD;
giiine-keeper, to endure the suspicion~ ~and&#xD;
calumny-of his neighbors, without making&#xD;
known the truth, which would have 6xeu~*&#xD;
ed him.&#xD;
When, at length, Pierre Aubin was s&amp;amp;t&#xD;
free, in virtue of the alibi which Regina's let-&#xD;
ter established-.~-he found Cecile at her fathers&#xD;
(for his house had been burnt down by the&#xD;
indignant peasantry) a prey to grief, sickness,&#xD;
aa4 delirium, and under the care of D0ct4*~'&#xD;
Pascal.&#xD;
Qa the first visit which The Doctor paid,&#xD;
subsequent to his ignominious expulsion 'fr~om&#xD;
Valganest, he detailed the treatment he;~ha~d&#xD;
received at the hands of James de Lahour-&#xD;
pilliere, and related the terrible ravings ~ff&#xD;
An~ine, which' confirmed the suspicions 'f&#xD;
old Decadi Robert that the Major Seignerolle~'&#xD;
had mpt with foul play.&#xD;
Pierre being bound by his promise tp~&amp;amp;l-&#xD;
cea' this knowledge of the existence or t1~e&#xD;
Major, could say nothing that would reu~o~e&#xD;
the impression that this person htnd1i~n&#xD;
murdered, Without having the permission,, 61'&#xD;

appearance, but wben all the legitimate sons&#xD;
5~f 1~tenne, th~o4ackn owledged Maxquis&#xD;
de Lab~,urdiIliere, had left him to his solitary&#xD;
grarideur the gamr~-keeper was heartily&#xD;
welcomed by the old man.&#xD;
'i'he Marquis resolved, without delay, to&#xD;
set about making atonement to his long-neg-&#xD;
lected son, and to the exemplary mother of&#xD;
thai son.&#xD;
TQ this end, he made use of his recovered&#xD;
titl~T and consequence to obtain a decree 'le-&#xD;
~git~mating that son, Pierre Aubin; and he&#xD;
determined to marry the unfortunate mother,&#xD;
for which purpose h~ journeyed to Paris.'&#xD;
,Thisobj~ct was not so easil~1 attained as&#xD;
he had expected. It took the iu~ited entrea-&#xD;
ties ~of Decadi 'and Pierre~ besides his own,&#xD;
to induce Euphrosine to accept the tardy act&#xD;
;of justice, which would. render herthe sharer&#xD;
o~ hjs name and rank!&#xD;
'lThwever, Euphrosine did consent that the&#xD;
~e~rnony should be performed, which made&#xD;
hem' Marchioness de Labourdilliere! She,&#xD;
who had toiled, with her needle, for years,&#xD;
W give, bread to her son!&#xD;
Once, mid for a long time, Euphrosine had&#xD;
patiently looked forward with delight tb the&#xD;
nuptial day; but it came so late, it found her&#xD;
~ahiv~mnd sad. The romance of feeling was&#xD;
ov'ei~Z~the 'romance of reality -was taking&#xD;
pI~ce! She was at once raised from mdi-&#xD;
gemice to ~vealth--from insignificance to a&#xD;
lofty position.&#xD;
'This marriage also restored her tG'h~r&#xD;
soh's society, and that of her brother Decad i,&#xD;
-1'or which she was truly gr~teful. Ere long,&#xD;
'her tender care and judicious nursing, ~lded&#xD;

&#xD;
air,' ~irai~e oPscene, 'and medical advice.&#xD;
Thei~', al~6~th~' party remained for a consi-&#xD;
derable time, as it was resolved that until&#xD;
Pid~re Aubixvcould be received at Valgnnest&#xD;
as .th'e'legitimate heir of its lord, he should&#xD;
not enter-the halls of his ancestors.&#xD;
This delay was profitably spent by the happy&#xD;
family, the newly 'adopted members of which&#xD;
were gradually prepared by the eccentric but&#xD;
accomplished Etienne, to lake their. places&#xD;
creditably among' the magnates of the country.&#xD;
The game-keeper of the forest of Bras-&#xD;
seuse and his dear Cecile, furnished occasion&#xD;
for another christening festival, which was&#xD;
celebrated on a grander scale than that with&#xD;
which our story commenced, but which we&#xD;
will forbear to describe; suffice it to say, that&#xD;
the whole country participated in the joyful&#xD;
fete, at which Pierre Aubin appeared no&#xD;
longer as the game-keeper, but as the heir to&#xD;
the property of his brother, now no more.&#xD;
The republican bias of the nobility, even,&#xD;
as well as the other classes of society, caused&#xD;
'this triumph, of the- plebian-mother and son,&#xD;
to be looked on with complacency.&#xD;
The rejoicings on the return of Etienne'&#xD;
with his f~a~riily to take possession of Valga-&#xD;
nest, with the christening of the grandson Qf&#xD;
the Marquis de Labourdilliere, were univer-&#xD;
sal and sincere; for few, if any, regretted&#xD;
t*he change of masters which had taken place.&#xD;
Etienne, known and esteerried formerly as&#xD;
Major Seignerolles, passed his last years&#xD;
happily, in carrying out his republican prin-&#xD;
ciples, in ame~orating the condition of his&#xD;
tenantry, and in the quiet domestic' circle he&#xD;
had wisely gathered about him.&#xD;
Decade Robert and he, used, together, to&#xD;
talk over their old campaigns and the glories&#xD;
of the consular days, and amuse themselves&#xD;
with the grandchildren successively present-&#xD;
ed~to them by the faithful and ever-loving&#xD;
couple, 4?ierre and Cecile.&#xD;
Rventr~ally, on the death of Regina,&#xD;
Gazeren Castle' and estates came into the&#xD;
possession of Pierre as the lawful heir.&#xD;
Thus was the game-keeper rewarded for&#xD;
his constancy to Cecile, and uis generosity to&#xD;
the unworthy aristocratbrotkers, by a' very&#xD;
unusual share of prospehty and happiness.&#xD;
