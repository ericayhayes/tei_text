            <p>IN commending this, the second volume of "<title>the Autographs for Freedom,</title>"
               to the attention of the public, "THE ROCHESTER LADIES' ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY" would
               congratulate themselves and the friends of freedom generally on the progress made,
               during the past year, by the cause to which the book is devoted.</p>
            <p>We greet thankfully those who have contributed of the wealth of their genius; the
               strength of their convictions; the ripeness of their judgment; their earnestness of
               purpose; their generous sympathies; to the completeness and excellence of the work;
               and we shall hope to meet many of them, if not all, in other numbers of "<title>The
                  Autograph,</title>" which may be called forth ere the chains of the Slave shall be

               <head type="sub">WHAT SOME OF THE BUILDERS HAVE THOUGHT.</head>
               <p>A WORD oft-times is expressive of an entire policy. Such is the term <hi rend="i"
                  />Abolition. Though formerly used as a synonym of <hi rend="i"/>Anti-Slavery,
                  people now clearly understand that the designs of those who have ranged themselves
                  under the first of these systems of reform are of deeper significance and wider
                  scope than are the objects contemplated by the latter, and concern themselves not
                  only with the great primary question of bodily freedom, but take in also the
                  collateral issues connected with human enfranchisement, independent of race,
                  complexion, or sex.</p>
               <p>The Abolitionist of to-day is the Iconoclast of the age, and his mission is to
                  break the idolatrous images<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6562-00000006"/> set up by a
                  hypocritical Church, a Sham Democracy, or a corrupt public sentiment, and to
                  substitute in their stead the simple and beautiful doctrine of a common
                  brotherhood. He would elevate every creature by abolishing the hinderances and
                  checks imposed upon him, whether these be legal or social—and in proportion as
                  such grievances are invidious and severe, in such measure does he place himself in
                  the front rank of the battle, to wage his emancipating war.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is that the Abolitionist has come to be considered the especial
                  friend of the negro, since <emph>he,</emph> of all others, has been made to drink
                  deep from the cup of oppression.</p>
               <p>The free-colored man at the north, for his bond-brother as for himself, has
                  trusted hopefully in the increasing public sentiment, which, in the multiplication
                  of these friends, has made his future prospects brighter. And, to-day, while he is
                  making a noble struggle to vindicate the claims of his entire class, depending
                  mainly for the accomplishment of that end on his own exertions, he passes in
                  review the devotion and sacrifices made in his behalf: gratitude is in his heart,
                  and thanks fall from his lips. But, in one department partment of reformatory
                  exertion he feels that he has been neglected. He has seen his pledged allies throw
                  themselves into the hottest of the battle, to fight for the Abolition of Capital
                  Punishment—for the Prohibition of the Liquor Traffic—for the Rights of Women, and
                  similar reforms,—but he has failed to see a corresponding earnestness, according
                  to the influence of Abolitionists in the business world, in opening the avenues of
                  industrial labor to the proscribed youth of the land. This work, therefore, is
                  evidently left for himself to do. And he has laid his powers to the task. The
                  record of his conclusions was given at Rochester, in July, and has become already
                  a part of history.</p>
               <p>Though shut out from the workshops of the country, he is determined to make
                  self-provision, so as to triumph over the spirit of caste that would keep him
                  degraded. The utility of the Industrial Institution he would erect, must, he
                  believes, commend itself to Abolitionists. But not only to them. The verdict of
                  less liberal minds has been given already in its favor. The usefulness, the
                  self-respect and self-dependence,—the combination of intelligence and
                  handicraft,—the accumulation of the materials of wealth, all referable<pb
                     n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6562-00000007"/> to such an Institution, present fair
                  claims to the assistance of the entire American people.</p>
               <p>Whenever emancipation shall take place, immediate though it be, the subjects of
                  it, like many who now make up the so-called free population, will be in what
                  Geologists call, the "Transition State." The prejudice now felt against them for
                  bearing on their persons the brand of slaves, cannot die out immediately. Severe
                  trials will still be their portion—the curse of a "taunted race" must be expiated
                  by almost miraculous proofs of advancement; and some of these miracles must be
                  antecedent to the great day of Jubilee. To fight the battle on the bare ground of
                  abstract principles, will fail to give us complete victory. The subterfuges of
                  pro-slavery selfishness must <emph>now</emph> be dragged to light, and the last
                  weak argument,—that the negro can never contribute anything to advance the
                  national character, "nailed to the counter as base coin." To the conquering of the
                  difficulties heaped up in the path of his industry, the free-colored man of the
                  North has pledged himself. Already he sees, springing into growth, from out his
                  foster <emph>work-school,</emph> intelligent young laborers, competent to enrich
                  the world with necessary products—industrious citizens, contributing their
                  proportion to aid on the advancing civilization of the country;—self-providing
                  artizans vindicating their people from the never-ceasing charge of a fitness for
                  servile positions.</p>
               <p>Abolitionists ought to consider it a legitimate part of their great work, to aid
                  in such an enterprise—to abolish not only chattel servitude, but that other kind
                  of slavery, which, for generation after generation, dooms an oppressed people to a
                  condition of dependence and pauperism. Such an Institution would be a shining
                  mark, in even this enlightened age; and every man and woman, equipped by its
                  discipline to do good battle in the arena of active life, would be, next to the
                  emancipated bondman, the most desirable "<title>Autograph for

               <head>Massacre at Blount's Fort.</head>
               <p>ON the west side of the Appalachicola River, some forty miles below the line of
                  Georgia, are yet found the ruins of what was once called "BLOUNT'S FORT." Its
                  ramparts are now covered with a dense growth of underbrush and small trees. You
                  may yet trace out its bastions, curtains, and magazine. At this time the country
                  adjacent presents the appearance of an unbroken wilderness, and the whole scene is
                  one of gloomy solitude, associated as it is with one of the most cruel massacres
                  which ever disgraced the American arms.</p>
               <p>The fort had originally been erected by civilized troops, and, when abandoned by
                  its occupants at the close of the war, in 1815, it was taken possession of by the
                  refugees from Georgia. But little is yet known of that persecuted people; their
                  history can only be found in the national archives at Washington. They had been
                  held as slaves in the State referred to; but during the Revolution they caught the
                  spirit of liberty, at that time so prevalent throughout our land, and fled from
                  their oppressors and found an asylum among the aborigines living in Florida.</p>
               <p>During forty years they had effectually eluded, or resisted, all attempts to
                  re-enslave them. They were true to themselves, to the instinctive love of liberty,
                  which is planted in every human heart. Most of them had been born amidst perils,
                  reared in the forest, and taught from their childhood to hate the oppressors of
                  their race. Most of those who had been personally held in degrading servitude,
                  whose backs had been seared by the lash of the savage overseer, had passed to that
                  spirit-land where the clanking of chains is not heard, where slavery is not known.
                  Some few of that class yet remained. Their gray hairs and feeble limbs, however,
                  indicated that they, too, must soon pass away. Of the three hundred and eleven
                  persons residing in "Blount's Fort" not more than twenty had been actually held in
                  servitude. The others were descended from slave parents, who fled from Georgia,
                  and, according to the laws of slave<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6562-00000009"/>
                  States, were liable to suffer the same outrages to which their ancestors had been
                  subjected.</p>
               <p>It is a most singular feature in slave-holding morals, that if the parents be
                  robbed of their liberty, deprived of the rights with which their Creator has
                  endowed them, the perpetrator of these wrongs becomes entitled to repeat them upon
                  the children of their former victims. There were also some few parents and
                  grandchildren, as well as middle-aged persons, who sought protection within the
                  walls of the Fort against the vigilant slave-catchers who occasionally were seen
                  prowling around the fortifications, but who dare not venture within the power of
                  those whom they sought to enslave.</p>
               <p>These fugitives had planted their gardens, and some of them had flocks roaming in
                  the wilderness; all were enjoying the fruits of their labor, and congratulating
                  themselves upon being safe from the attacks of those who enslave mankind. But the
                  spirit of oppression is inexorable. The slaveholders finding they could not
                  themselves obtain possession of their intended victims, called on the President of
                  the United States for assistance to perpetrate the crime of enslaving their fellow
                  men. That functionary had been reared amid southern institutions. He entertained
                  no doubt of the right of one man to enslave another. He did not doubt that if a
                  man held in servitude should attempt to escape, he would be worthy of death. In
                  short, he fully sympathised with those who sought his official aid. He immediately
                  directed the Secretary of War to issue orders to the Commander of the "Southern
                  Military District of the United States" to send a detachment of troops to destroy
                  "Blount's Fort," and to "<emph>seize those who occupied it and return them to
                     their masters.</emph>"<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001"

               <p>General Jackson, at that time Commander of the Southern Military District,
                  directed Lieut-Colonel Clinch to perform the barbarous task. I was at one time
                  personally acquainted with that officer, and know the impulses of his generous
                  nature, and can readily account for the failure of his expedition. He marched to
                  the vicinity of the Fort, made the necessary recognisance, and returned, making
                  report that "the fortification was not accessible by land."<ref rend="super"

                     and could probably have captured the Fort in one hour, had he desired to do
                     so.</p>

               <p>Orders were then issued to Commodore Patterson, directing him to carry out the
                  directions of the Secretary of War. He at that time commanded the American
                  flotilla lying in "Mobile Bay," and instantly issued an order to Lieut. Loomis to
                  ascend the Appalachicola River with two gun-boats, "to seize the people in
                  BLOUNT'S FORT, deliver them to their owners, and destroy the Fort."</p>
               <p>On the morning of the 17th Sept., A. D. 1816, a spectator might have seen several
                  individuals standing upon the walls of that fortress watching with intense
                  interest the approach of two small vessels that were slowly ascending the river,
                  under full-spread canvas, by the aid of a light southern breeze. They were in
                  sight at early dawn, but it was ten o'clock when they furled their sails and cast
                  anchor opposite the Fort, and some four or five hundred yards distant from it.</p>
               <p>A boat was lowered, and soon a midshipman and twelve men were observed making for
                  the shore. They were met at the water's edge by some half dozen of the principal
                  men in the Fort, and their errand demanded.</p>
               <p>The young officer told them he was sent to make demand of the Fort, and that its
                  inmates were to be given up to the "slaveholders, then on board the gun-boat, who
                  claimed them as fugitive slaves!" The demand was instantly rejected, and the
                  midshipman and his men returned to the gun-boats and informed Lieut. Loomis of the
                  answer he had received.</p>
               <p>As the colored men entered the Fort they related to their companions the demand
                  that had been made. Great was the consternation manifested by the females, and
                  even a portion of the sterner sex appeared to be distressed at their situation.
                  This was observed by an old patriarch, who had drunk the bitter cup of servitude,
                  one who bore on his person the visible marks of the thong, as well as the brand of
                  his master, upon his shoulder. He saw his friends faultered, and he spoke
                  cheerfully to them. He assured them that they were safe from the cannon shot of
                  the enemy—that there were not men enough on board the vessels to storm their Fort,
                  and finally closed with the emphatic declaration: "<emph>Give me liberty or give
                     me death!</emph>" This saying was repeated by many agonized fathers and mothers
                  on that bloody day.</p>
               <p>A cannonade was soon commenced upon the Fort, but without much apparent effect.
                  The shots were<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6562-00000011"/> harmless; they penetrated
                  the earth of which the walls were composed, and were there buried, without further
                  injury. Some two hours were thus spent without injuring any person in the Fort.
                  They then commenced throwing bombs. The bursting of these shells had more effect.
                  There was no shelter from these fatal messages. Mothers gathered their little ones
                  around them and pressed their babes more closely to their bosoms, as one explosion
                  after another warned them of their imminent danger. By these explosions some were
                  occasionally wounded and a few killed, until, at length, the shrieks of the
                  wounded and groans of the dying were heard in various parts of the fortress.</p>
               <p>Do you ask why these mothers and children were thus butchered in cold blood? I
                  answer, they were slain for adhering to the doctrine that "all men are endowed by
                  their Creator with the <emph>inalienable right to enjoy life and liberty.</emph>"
                  Holding to this doctrine of Hancock and of Jefferson, the power of the nation was
                  arrayed against them, and our army employed to deprive them of life.</p>
               <p>The bombardment was continued some hours with but little effect, so far as the
                  assailants could discover. They manifested no disposition to surrender. The day
                  was passing away. Lieut. Loomis called a council of officers and put to them the
                  question, <emph>what further shall be done?</emph> An under officer suggested the
                  propriety of firing "hot shot at the magazine." The proposition was agreed to. The
                  furnaces were heated, balls were prepared, and the cannonade was resumed. The
                  occupants of the Fort felt relieved by the change. They could hear the deep
                  humming sound of the cannon balls, to which they had become accustomed in the
                  early part of the day, and some made themselves merry at the supposed folly of
                  their assailants. They knew not that the shot was heated, and was therefore
                  unconscious of the danger which threatened them.</p>
               <p>The sun was rapidly descending in the west. The tall pines and spruce threw their
                  shadows over the fortification. The roar of the cannon, the sighing of the shot,
                  the groans of the wounded, the-dark shades of approaching evening, all conspired
                  to render the scene one of intense gloom. They longed for the approaching night to
                  close around them in order that they might bury the dead, and flee to the
                  wilderness for safety.</p>
               <p>Suddenly a startling phenomena presented itself to their astonished view. The
                  heavy embankment and<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6562-00000012"/> timbers protecting
                  the magazine appeared to rise from the earth, and the next <emph>instant</emph>
                  the dreadful explosion overwhelmed them, and the next found two <emph>hundred and
                     seventy</emph> parents and children in the immediate presence of a holy God,
                  making their appeal for retributive justice upon the government who had murdered
                  them, and the freemen of the north who sustained such unutterable crimes.<ref

               <p>Many were crushed by the falling earth and the timbers; many were entirely buried
                  in the ruins. Some were horribly mangled by the fragments of timber and the
                  explosion of charged shells that were in the magazine. Limbs were torn from the
                  bodies to which they had been attached. Mothers and babes lay beside each other,
                  wrapped in that sleep which knows no waking.</p>
               <p>The sun had set, and the twilight of evening was closing around them, when some
                  sixty sailors, under the officer second in command, landed, and, without
                  opposition, entered the Fort. The veteran sailors, accustomed to blood and
                  carnage, were horror-stricken as they viewed the scene before them. They were
                  accompanied, however, by some twenty slaveholders, all anxious for their prey.
                  These paid little attention to the dead and dying, but anxiously seized upon the
                  living, and, fastening the fetters upon their limbs, hurried them from the Fort,
                  and instantly commenced their return towards the frontier of Georgia. Some fifteen
                  persons in the Fort survived the terrible explosion, and they now sleep in servile
                  graves, or moan and weep in bondage.</p>
               <p>The officer in command of the party, with his men, returned to the boats as soon
                  as the slaveholders were fairly in possession of their victims. The sailors
                  appeared gloomy and thoughtful as they returned to their vessels. The anchors were
                  weighed, the sails unfurled, and both vessels hurried from the scene of butchery
                  as rapidly as they were able. After the officers had retired to their cabins, the
                  rough-featured sailors gathered before the mast, and loud and bitter were the
                  curses they uttered against slavery and against those officers of government who
                  had then constrained them to murder women and helpless children, merely for their
                  love of liberty.</p>
               <p>But the dead remained unburied; and the next day the vultures were feeding upon
                  the carcasses of young men and young women, whose hearts on the previous<pb
                     n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6562-00000013"/> morning had beaten high with expectation.
                  Their bones have been bleaching in the sun for thirty-seven years, and may yet be
                  seen scattered among the ruins of that ancient fortification.</p>
               <p>Twenty-two years elapsed, and a representative in Congress, from one of the free
                  States, reported a bill giving to the perpetrators of these murders a gratuity of
                  five thousand dollars from the public treasury, as a token of the gratitude which
                  the people of this nation felt for the soldierly and gallant manner in which the
                  crime was committed toward them. The bill passed both houses of Congress, was
                  approved by the President, and now stands upon our statute book among the laws
                  enacted at the 3d Session of the 25th Congress.</p>
               <p>The facts are all found scattered among the various public documents which repose
                  in the alcoves of our National Library. But no historian has been willing to
                  collect and publish them, in consequence of the deep disgrace which they reflect
                  upon the American arms, and upon those who then controlled the government.</p>

               <p>FEW laws have ever been passed better calculated than this to harden the heart and
                  benumb the conscience of every man who assists in its execution. It pours contempt
                  upon the dictates of justice and humanity. It levels in the dust the barriers
                  erected by the common law for the protection of personal liberty. Its victims are
                  native born Americans, uncharged with crime. These men are seized, without notice,
                  and instantly carried before an officer, by whom they are generally hurried off
                  into a cruel bondage, for the remainder of their days, and sometimes without time
                  being allowed for a parting interview with their families. Such treatment would be
                  cruel toward criminals; but these men are adjudged to toil, to stripes, to
                  ignorance, to poverty, to hopeless degradation, on the pretence that they "owe
                     service<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6562-00000014"/> vice." This allegation all
                  know to be utterly false, they having never promised to serve, and being legally
                  incapable of making any contract. Every act of Christian kindness to these unhappy
                  people, tending to secure to them the rights which our declaration of independence
                  asserts belong <emph>to all</emph> men, is made by this accursed law a penal
                  offence, to be punished with fine and imprisonment. Mock judges, unknown to the
                  constitution, and bribed by the promise of double fees to re-enslave the fugitive,
                  are commanded to decide, <emph>summarily,</emph> the most momentous personal
                  issue, with the single exception of life and death, that could possibly engage the
                  attention of a legal tribunal of the most august character. Yet this tremendous
                  issue of liberty or bondage, is to be decided, not only in a hurry, but on such
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">prima facie</foreign> evidence as may satisfy the
                  judge, and this judge, too, <emph>selected</emph> from a herd of similar
                  creatures, by the claimant himself! An <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ex parte</foreign>
                  affidavit, made by an absent and interested party, with the certificate of an
                  absent judge that he believes it to be true, is to be received as CONCLUSIVE, in
                  the face of any amount of oral and documentary testimony to the contrary. "Can a
                  man take fire into his bosom and not be burned?" Can a man aid in executing such a
                  law without defiling his own conscience? Yet does this profligate statute, with
                  impious arrogance, command "ALL GOOD CITIZENS" to assist in enforcing it, when
                  required so to do by an official slave-catcher!</p>
               <p>It is a singular fact, in the history of this enactment, that Mr. Mason, who
                  introduced the bill, and Mr. Webster, who, in advance, pledged to it his support
                  "to the fullest extent," both confessed, on the floor of Congress, that in their
                  individual judgments, it was UNCONSTITUTIONAL,—that is, that the constitution, as
                  they expounded it, imposed upon the <emph>States</emph> severally, the obligation
                  to surrender fugitive slaves, and gave Congress no power to legislate on the
                  subject. The Supreme Court, however, having otherwise determined, these gentlemen
                  acquiesced in its decision, without being convinced by it. It is well known how
                  grossly Mr. Webster, in his subsequent canvass for the Presidency, insulted all
                  who, like himself, denied the constitutionality of the law. Another significant
                  fact in the same history is, that the law was passed by a <emph>minority</emph> of
                  the House of Representatives. Of 232 members, only 109 recorded their names in its
                  favor. Many, deterred either by scruples of conscience<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000015"/> science or doubts of the popularity of the measure,
                  declined voting, while party discipline prevented them from offering to it an open
                  and manly resistance. A third fact in this history, worthy to be remembered, is,
                  that the advocates of the law are conscious that its revolting provisions would
                  not bear discussion, forced its passage under the previous question, thus
                  preventing any remarks on its enormities—any appeals to the consciences of the
                  members—against the perpetration of such detestable wickedness.</p>
               <p>Seldom has any public iniquity been committed to which the words of the Psalmist
                  have been so applicable: "Surely the wrath of man shall praise THEE; and the
                  remainder of wrath shalt THOU restrain."</p>
               <p>It was happily so ordered, that several of the early seizures and surrenders under
                  this law were conducted with such marked barbarity, such cruel indecent haste,
                  such wanton disregard of justice and of humanity, as to shock the moral sense of
                  the community, and to render the law intensely hateful.</p>
               <p>Very soon after the law went into operation, one of the pseudo judges created by
                  it, surrendered an alleged slave, on evidence which no jury would have deemed
                  sufficient to establish a title to a dog. In vain the wretched man declared his
                  freedom—in vain he named six witnesses whom he swore could prove his freedom—in
                  vain he implored for a delay of ONE HOUR. He was sent off as a slave, guarded, at
                  the expense of the United States treasury, to his pretended master in Maryland,
                  who honestly refused to receive him. The judge had made a mistake(!) and had sent
                  a free man instead of a slave.</p>
               <p>This vile law, although of course receiving the sanction of the Democrats, it
                  being a bid for the Presidency, was a device of the Whig party, and could not have
                  been carried but by the co-operation of Webster, Clay, and Fillmore. As if to
                  enhance the value of the bid, the Administration affected a desire to baptise it
                  in northern blood, by making resistance to the law, a crime to be punished with
                  DEATH. The hustling of an officer, and the consequent escape of an arrested
                  fugitive, were declared, by the Secretary of State, to be a <emph>levying of war
                     against the United States</emph>—of course an act of HIGH TREASON, to be
                  expiated on the gallows; and the rioters at Christiana were prosecuted for HIGH
                  TREASON, in pursuance of orders forwarded from Washington. This wretched
                  sycophancy won no favor from the slaveholders<pb n="32-33"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000016"/> holders, and the result of the abominable and
                  absurd prosecution only brought on the authors and advocates of the law fresh
                  obloquy. When men obtain some rich and splendid prize, by their wrong-doing, many
                  admire their boldness and dexterity, but foolish, profitless wickedness ensures
                  only contempt. The northern Whigs, in doing obeisance to the slave power, sinned
                  against their oft-repeated and solemn professions and pledges. They sinned in the
                  expectation of thereby electing a President, and enjoying the patronage he would
                  dispense. Most bitterly were these men disappointed, first in the candidate
                  selected, and next in the result of the election. The party has been beaten to
                  death, and it died unhonored and unwept. Let the Fugitive Slave Law be its
                  epitaph. Truly the Whig politicians were "snared in the work of their own
                  hands."</p>
               <p>Certain fashionable Divines deemed it expedient to second the efforts of the
                  politicians in catching slaves, by talking from their pulpits about Hebrew
                  slavery, and the reverence due to the "powers that be ordained of God." Yet the
                  injunctions of the fugitive law were so obviously at variance with the "HIGHER
                  LAW" of justice and mercy which these gentlemen were required by their Divine
                  Master to inculcate, that "cotton divinity" fell into disrepute, nor could the
                  plaudits of politicians and union committees save its clerical professors from
                  forfeiting the esteem and confidence of multitudes of Christian people.</p>
               <p>But Whig politicians and cotton Divines are not the only friends of the fugitive
                  law to whom it has made most ungrateful returns. The Democratic leaders, bidding
                  against the Whigs for the Presidency, were most vociferous in expressions of the
                  delight they took in the human chase. Democratic candidates for the Presidency, to
                  the goodly number of NINE, gave public attestations under their <emph>signs
                     manual,</emph> of their approbation of a law outraging the principles of
                  Democracy, as well as of common justice and humanity. Each and all of these men
                  were rejected, and the slaveholders selected an individual whom they were well
                  assured would be their obsequious tool, but who had offered no bribe for their
                  votes.</p>
               <p>But did the slaveholders themselves gain more by this law than their northern
                  auxiliaries? They, indeed, hailed its passage as a mighty triumph. The nation had
                  given them a law, drafted by themselves, laying down the rules of the hunt, as
                  best suited their<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6562-00000017"/> pleasure and interest.
                  Wealthy and influential gentlemen in our commercial cities, out of compliment to
                  southern electors, became amateur huntsmen, and in New York and Boston the chase
                  was pursued with all the zeal and apparent delight that could have been expected
                  in Guinea or Virginia. Slave-catching was the test, at once, of patriotism and
                  gentility, while sympathy for the wretched fugitive was the mark of vulgar
                  fanaticism. The north was humbled in the dust, by the action of her own recreant
                  sons. Every "good citizen" found himself, for the first time in the history of
                  mankind, a slave-catcher by law. Every official, appointed by a slave-catching
                  judge, was invested with the authority of a High Sheriff, being empowered to call
                  out the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">posse comitatus,</foreign> and compel the
                  neighbors to join in a slave chase. Well, indeed, might the slaveholders rejoice
                  and make merry;—well, indeed, in the insolence of triumph, might they command the
                  people of the north to hold their tongues about "the peculiar institution," under
                  pain of their sore displeasure.</p>
               <p>But amid this slavery jubilee, a woman's heart was swelling and heaving with
                  indignant sorrow at the outrages offered to God and man by the fugitive law. Her
                  pent up emotions struggled for utterance, and at last, as if moved by some mighty
                  inspiration, and in all the fervor of Christian love, she put forth a book which
                  arrested the attention of the WORLD. A miracle of authorship, this book attained,
                  within twelve months, a circulation without a parallel in the history of printing.
                  In that brief space, about two millions of volumes proclaimed, in the languages of
                  civilization, the wrongs of the slave and the atrocities of the AMERICAN FUGITIVE
                  LAW. The gaze of mankind is now turned upon the slaveholders and their northern
                  auxiliaries, both clerical and lay. The subjects of European despotisms console
                  themselves with the grateful conviction, that however harsh may be their own
                  governments, they make no approach to the baseness or to the cruelty and tyranny
                  of the "peculiar institution" of the Model Republic.<ref rend="super"

                     suffered at the hands of its rulers. The American's profferred sympathy was
                     coldly received. "We admit," was the reply, "that there is much wrong here,

                  proceeded from an uninspired pen, was gravely declared, by an organ of cotton

                     from the reverend gentlemen of the "Observer" and the Vatican, in their
                     estimate of the character of the book. Said Dr. Wardlaw, who on this subject
                     may be regarded as the representative of the Protestant Divines of Europe:
                     "He who can read it without the breathings of devotion, must, if he call
                     himself a Christian, have a Christianity as <emph>unique and

               </note>
               <p>Branded with falsehood and impiety, the author was happily put on her trial before
                  the civilized world. She collected, arranged, and gave to the press, a mass of
                  unimpeachable documents, consisting of laws, judicial decisions, trials,
                  confessions of slaveholders, advertisements from southern papers, and testimonies
                  of eye-witnesses. The proof was conclusive and over-whelming that the picture she
                  had drawn of American slavery was unfaithful, only because the coloring was faint,
                  and wanted the crimson dye of the original. A verdict of not guilty of
                  exaggeration has been rendered by acclamation.</p>
               <p>It has long been the standing refuge of the slave-holders, that northern men and
                  Europeans, in condemning slavery, were passing judgment against an institution of
                  which they were ignorant. The "peculiar institution" was represented as some great
                     <emph>mystery</emph> which could not be understood beyond the slave region.
                  Thanks to the fugitive law, it has led to the construction of a
                  "<emph>key,</emph>" which has unlocked our Republican bastile, thrown open to the
                  sunlight its hideous dungeons, and exposed the various instruments of<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000019"/> torture for subjecting the soul, as well as the
                  body, to hopeless and unresisting bondage. The iniquity of our cherished
                  institution is no longer a MYSTERY. All Christendom is now made familiar with it,
                  and is sending forth a cry of indignant remonstrance and of taunting scorn. Such
                  is the suppression of anti-slavery agitation given to the slaveholders by their
                  northern friends—such the strength imparted by the fugitive slave law to the
                  system of human bondage. How applicable to the inventors and supporters of that
                  statute are the words of David, in regard to some politician of his own day:
                  "Behold he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought
                  forth falsehood. He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which
                  he made. His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing
                  shall come down upon his own pate;" and then he adds, "I will praise the Lord." So
                  also let the Christian bless and magnify HIM, who by his infinite wisdom brings
                  good out of evil, and in the case of the fugitive law, HATH CAUSED THE WRATH OF
                  MAN TO PRAISE HIM.</p>
               <p>But there is still a <emph>remainder</emph> of wrath. The law is still on the
                  Statute Book, and hungry politicians are promising that there it shall ever
                  remain; and terrible threats come from the south, of the ruin that shall overwhelm
                  the free States, should the law be repealed or rendered less abominable than at
                  present. Yet, in spite of northern promises, and professions of security, and in
                  spite of the great swelling words of the dealers in human flesh, the
                     <emph>practical,</emph> like the moral working of the law, has been very far
                  from what its authors anticipated. The law was passed the 18th September, 1850,
                  and, in two years and nine months, not fifty slaves have been recovered under
                  it—not an average of EIGHTEEN slaves a year! Poor compensation this to the
                  slaveholders for making themselves a bye-word, a proverb, and a reproach to
                  Christendom—for giving a new and mighty impulse to abolition, and for deepening
                  the detestation felt by the true friends of liberty and humanity, for an
                  institution asking and obtaining for its protection a law so repugnant to the
                  moral sense of mankind. But while this artful and wicked law, with its army of
                  ten-dollar judges, and marshals, and constables, and office-seekers, and
                  politicians, with the President and his cabinet all striving to enforce it, "to
                  the fullest extent," has restored to their masters not <emph>eighteen
                     slaves</emph>
                  <pb n="40" xml:id="VAC6562-00000020"/> a year; the escapes from the prison house
                  have probably never been more numerous, nor the aid and sympathy afforded by
                  Christians more abundant. Thus has THE REMAINDER OF WRATH BEEN RESTRAINED. In the
                  marvellous conversion of this odious law into an anti-slavery agency, let us find
                  a new motive for unceasing and unwearied agitation against slavery, and a new
                  pledge of ultimate triumph.</p>

               <p>A QUAINT old writer describes a class of persons who have souls so very small that
                  "500 of them could dance at once upon the point of a cambric needle." These wee
                  people are often wrapped up in a lump of the very coarsest of human clay,
                  ponderous enough to give them the semblance of full-grown men and women. A grain
                  of mustard seed, buried in the heart of a mammoth pumpkin, would be no comparison
                  to the little soul, sheathed in its full grown body. The contrast in size would be
                  insufficient to convey an adequate impression; and the tiny soul has little of the
                  mustard seed spiciness.</p>
               <p>Yet if this mass of flesh is only wrapped up in a <emph>white skin;</emph> even
                  though it is not nearly thick enough to conceal the grossness and coarseness of
                  the veiled material, the poor "feeble folk" within will fancy<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000022"/> that he really belongs to the natural variety of
                  aristocratic humanity. He has the good taste to refuse condescension sufficient to
                  allow him to eat at table with a Frederick Douglass, a Samuel R. Ward, or a Dr.
                  Pennington. Poor light little soul! It can borrow a pair of flea's legs, and,
                  hopping up to the magnificent lights of public opinion, sit looking down upon the
                  whole colored race in sovereign contempt.</p>
               <p>Take off the thin veneering of a white skin, substitute in its stead the real
                  African ebony, and then place him side by side with one of the above-mentioned
                  men. Measure intellect with intellect—eloquence with eloquence! Mental and moral
                  infancy stand abashed in the presence of nature's noblemen!</p>
               <p>So, mere complexion is elevated above character. Sensible men and women are not
                  ashamed of the acknowledgment. The fact has a popular endorsement. People

                  lose cast yourself for want of approved taste.</p>
               <p>If sin is capable of being made to look mean, narrow, contemptible—to exhibit
                  itself in its character of thorough, unmitigated bitterness—it is when exhibited

                  preeminent over all else—all this could not make a black man the social equal of a
                  white coxcomb, even though his brain were as blank as white paper, and his heart
                  as black as darkness concentrated. May heaven alleviate our undiluted
                  stupidity!</p>

                  <l>THERE is, at times, an evening sky—</l>

                  good, for that which is morally wrong can never be politically right.</p>
               <p>Fine moral sense will pour indignation on oppression, as well as applause on
                  worth. It will give sympathy to the afflicted, and treasures to relieve the needy.
                  Such a spirit will exalt a nation, and command the respect of other nations. But
                  general freedom can only flourish beneath the undisturbed dominion of equitable
                  laws.</p>
               <p>Governments should aim at the welfare of the people, and that government which
                  secures the person, the property, the liberty, the lives of dutiful subjects, and
                  thus makes the common good the rule and measure of its government, will receive a

               <head>Visit of a Fugitive Slave to the Grave of Wilberforce.</head>
               <p>ON a beautiful morning in the month of June, while strolling about Trafalgar
                  Square, I was attracted to the base of the Nelson column, where a crowd was
                  standing gazing at the bas-relief representations of some of the great naval
                  exploits of the man whose statue stands on the top of the pillar. The death-wound
                  which the hero received on board the Victory, and his being carried from the
                  ship's deck by his companions, is executed with great skill. Being no admirer of
                  warlike heroes, I was on the point of turning away, when I perceived among the
                  figures (which were as large as life) a full-blooded African, with as white a set
                  of teeth as ever I had seen, and all the other peculiarities of feature that
                  distinguish that race from the rest of the human family, with<figure>
                     <p>Wm. W. Brown.</p>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="71" xml:id="VAC6562-00000037"/> musket in hand and a dejected countenance,
                  which told that he had been in the heat of the battle, and shared with the other
                  soldiers the pain in the loss of their commander. However, as soon as I saw my
                  sable brother, I felt more at home, and remained longer than I had intended. Here
                  was the Negro, as black a man as was ever imported from the coast of Africa,
                  represented in his proper place by the side of Lord Nelson, on one of England's
                  proudest monuments. How different, thought I, was the position assigned to the
                  colored man on similar monuments in the United States. Some years since, while
                  standing under the shade of the monument erected to the memory of the brave
                  Americans who fell at the storming of Fort Griswold, Connecticut, I felt a degree
                  of pride as I beheld the names of two Africans who had fallen in the fight, yet I
                  was grieved but not surprised to find their names colonized off, and a line drawn
                  between them and the whites. This was in keeping with American historical
                  injustice to its colored heroes.</p>
               <p>The conspicuous place assigned to this representative of an injured race, by the
                  side of one of England's greatest heroes, brought vividly before my eye<pb
                     n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6562-00000038"/> the wrongs of Africa and the
                  philanthropic man of Great Britain, who had labored so long and so successfully
                  for the abolition of the slave trade, and the emancipation of the slaves of the
                  West Indies; and I at once resolved to pay a visit to the grave of
                  Wilberforce.</p>
               <p>A half an hour after, I entered Westminster Abbey, at Poets' Corner, and proceeded
                  in search of the patriot's tomb; I had, however, gone but a few steps, when I
                  found myself in front of the tablet erected to the memory of Granville Sharpe, by
                  the African Institution of London, in 1816; upon the marble was a long
                  inscription, recapitulating many of the deeds of this benevolent man, and from
                  which I copied the following:—"He aimed to rescue his native country from the
                  guilt and inconsistency of employing the arm of freedom to rivet the fetters of
                  bondage, and establish for the negro race, in the person of Somerset, the
                  long-disputed rights of human nature. Having in this glorious cause triumphed over
                  the combined resistance of interest, prejudice, and pride, he took his post among
                  the foremost of the honorable band associated to deliver Africa from the rapacity
                  of Europe, by the abolition of the slave-trade; nor was death permitted to
                  interrupt his career of usefulness, till he had witnessed that act of the British
                  Parliament by which the abolition was decreed." After viewing minutely the profile
                  of this able defender of the negro's rights, which was finely chiselled on the
                  tablet, I took a hasty glance at Shakspeare, on the one side, and Dryden on the
                  other, and then passed on, and was soon in the north aisle, looking upon the
                  mementoes placed in honor of genius. There stood a grand and expressive monument
                  to Sir Isaac Newton, which was in every way worthy of the great man to whose
                  memory it was erected. A short distance from that was a statue to Addison,
                  representing the great writer clad in his morning gown, looking as if he had just
                  left the study, after finishing some chosen article for the
                     <title>Spectator.</title> The stately monument to the Earl of Chatham is the
                  most attractive in this part of the Abbey. Fox, Pitt, Grattan, and many others,
                  are here represented by monuments. I had to stop at the splendid marble erected to
                  the memory of Sir Fowell Buxton, Bart. A long inscription enumerates his many good
                  qualities, and concludes by saying:—"This monument is erected by his friends and
                  fellow-laborers, at home and abroad, assisted by<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000039"/> the grateful contributions of many thousands of the
                  African race." A few steps further and I was standing over the ashes of
                  Wilberforce. In no other place so small do so many great men lie together. The
                  following is the inscription on the monument erected to the memory of this devoted
                  friend of the oppressed and degraded negro race:—</p>
               <p>"To the memory of WILLIAM WILBERFORCE, born in Hull, August 24, 1759, died in
                  London, July 29, 1833. For nearly half a century a member of the House of Commons,
                  and for six parliaments during that period, one of the two representatives for
                  Yorkshire. In an age and country fertile in great and good men, he was among the
                  foremost of those who fixed the character of their times; because to high and
                  various talents, to warm benevolence, and to universal candor, he added the
                  abiding eloquence of a Christian life. Eminent as he was in every department of
                  public labor, and a leader in every work of charity, whether to relieve the
                  temporal or the spiritual wants of his fellow men, his name will ever be specially
                  identified with those exertions which, by the blessings of God, removed from
                  England the guilt of the African slave-trade, and prepared the way for the
                  abolition tion of slavery in every colony of the empire. In the prosecution of
                  these objects, he relied not in vain on God; but, in the progress, he was called
                  to endure great obloquy and great opposition. He out lived, however, all enmity,
                  and, in the evening of his days, withdrew from public life and public observation,
                  to the bosom of his family. Yet he died not unnoticed or forgotten by his country;
                  the Peers and Commons of England, with the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker at
                  their head, in solemn procession from their respective houses, carried him to his
                  fitting place among the mighty dead around, here to repose, till, through the
                  merits of Jesus Christ his only Redeemer and Saviour, whom in his life and in his
                  writings he had desired to glorify, he shall rise in the resurrection of the
                  just."</p>
               <p>The monument is a fine one; his figure is seated on a pedestal, very ingeniously
                  done, and truly expressive of his age, and the pleasure he seemed to derive from
                  his own thoughts. Either the orator or the poet have said or sung the praises of
                  most of the great men who lie buried in Westminster Abbey, in enchanting strains.
                  The statues of heroes, princes, and statesmen are there to proclaim their power,
                  worth, or brilliant<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6562-00000040"/> genius, to posterity.
                  But as time shall step between them and the future, none will be sought after with
                  more enthusiasm or greater pleasure than that of Wilberforce. No man's philosophy
                  was ever moulded in a nobler cast than his; it was founded in the school of
                  Christianity, which was, that all men are by nature equal; that they are wisely
                  and justly endowed by their Creator with certain rights which are irrefragable,
                  and no matter how human pride and avarice may depress and debase, still God is the
                  author of good to man; and of evil, man is the artificer to himself and to his
                  species. Unlike Plato and Socrates, his mind was free from the gloom that
                  surrounded theirs. Let the name, the worth, the zeal, and other excellent
                  qualifications of this noble man, ever live in our hearts, let his deeds ever be
                  the theme of our praise, and let us teach our children to honor and love the name
                  of William Wilberforce.</p>

               <head>Narrative of Albert and Mary.</head>
               <p>IT was a beautiful morning as ever glittered over the broad Atlantic. The sun had
                  the brightness and the sky the soft cerulean with which the month of June adorns
                  the latitude of Carolina. The sea was not heavy nor rolling, but its motion was
                  just enough to make its waves sparkle under the slanting rays of the morning
                  sun.</p>
               <p>Mary stood with her betrothed in the bow of the boat, as it gracefully ploughed
                  its way towards New York. She was only eighteen, and Albert was just twenty.</p>
               <p>Mary was on her way to Troy, to complete her studies in the excellent institution

                  to refine and bless the world. She had been entrusted to Albert's care, who was to
                     spend<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6562-00000041"/> his summer in New York, in the
                  pursuit of the legal profession. They were both Carolinians, and had no little of
                  that ardent spirit which distinguishes the youth of the South; while their
                  well-developed forms, their intellectual countenances, and their sensible speech,
                  placed them in association beyond their years.</p>
               <p>As Mary leaned upon the arm of her gallant protector, their conversation sparkled
                  as the ocean spray that dashed against steamer's bow. But suddenly, as the jet
                  black eye of Albert Gillon caught the soft blue of Mary's, he started at the
                  discovery of a tear trembling upon her eye-lash.</p>
               <p>"Sweet Mary, what saddens you?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! Albert, the greatest trial of my feelings is the thought that you have never
                  yet consecrated yourself to Christ."</p>
               <p>"I have," replied Albert, "no natural repugnance to religion. On the contrary, I
                  see and acknowledge God in all his works and in all his providence, as the author
                  and supreme ruler of all things. But, Mary, I do not understand the God of the
                  Bible. I do not understand how they who claim to be God's own people, and have the
                  distinguishing title of Christians tians, are, many of them, far worse in moral
                  character, than those who make no such profession. I do not mean hypocrites; but
                  those who are actually respected as orthodox Christians. There is Mr. Verse, of
                  Philadelphia, for instance, who has a high place as a religious editor, and
                  discusses the doctrines of Christianity with a zeal which shows he takes deep
                  interest in his work, and yet young as I am, and gay as I am, I can see that in
                  his practical application of Christianity, he teaches sentiments at variance with
                  the plainest principles of moral truth; and he sets himself against those whose
                  moral character is above reproach; and rebukes them as infidels in their very
                  efforts to elevate the moral tone of society. How is it that Mr. Verse is
                  recognized as a Christian, and these excellent men are avoided as infidels? Why is
                  he fit for heaven, and they must be cast down to hell? I don't understand it."</p>
               <p>"I know," replied Mary, "that wiser heads than mine find difficulty in answering
                  your question; and it would be presumptuous in me to signify that I can solve it
                  to your satisfaction. But still, Albert, your observations only confirm, in my own
                  mind, your total ignorance of what constitutes a Christian. Albert<pb n="80-81"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000042"/> bert, it is not morality; it is not consistency of
                  practice with profession; it is not the <emph>doing</emph> right that makes a
                  Christian, for if man could have attained to entire correctness in morals, there
                  would have been no such thing as Christianity. But it is because of man's
                  wickedness and his inconsistency, both in theory and in practice, that the
                  Christian religion is presented as the means of attaining to
                     <emph>salvation.</emph> Christ makes the Christian—the Christian in Christ and
                  Christ in the Christian—a loving, affectionate, endearing union—of ignorance with
                  wisdom, of infirmity with strength, of immorality with virtue. Christ throws his
                  robe of righteousness over the follies and the wickedness of the converted soul,
                  and by covering him with himself, gradually similates him to himself until what is
                  carnal being cast off, the spiritual remains at death a pure child of God."</p>
               <p>"Dear me, Mary, you look lovely as you speak this mysterious theology. And I
                  really pant after such feelings as I see beaming from your countenance; but you
                  might just as well speak to me in Arabic for any understanding I can have of this
                  thing called Christianity. It must be something good, or it could not thus fill
                  your own soul, intelligent as you are, with a joy that makes you indifferent to
                  those gaieties of life which give me pleasure."</p>
               <p>"You need," said Mary, "the teachings of God's spirit. You know I took delight in
                  those things a year ago, but God's spirit taught me that I was sinning in
                  partaking of them. I was at Fayolle's, dancing, and, in the midst of a figure in
                  the cotillon, my head became giddy, and I had to be supported to a seat. I soon
                  recovered, but the thought of a sudden death distressed me, for it came very
                  forcibly to my mind—I am a wicked sinner."</p>
               <p>"O, Mary, Mary," interrupted Albert, "you did not think yourself a sinner!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Albert, I did. I had never thought so before, but had rather prided myself
                  upon being called a good girl by all my acquaintances. But I now saw things in a
                  different light; and when I went home and began self-examination, I soon found I
                  had a very wicked heart. I tried to do better, but the more I tried to live unto
                  God the more I discovered the proneness of my heart to sin. I tried to think good
                  thoughts, and evil thoughts came directly in my way to mar my peace. Day after day
                  I made effort to purify my thoughts. It was all in vain. A pure<pb n="82-83"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000043"/> thought immediately suggested its opposite, and I
                  found myself more familiar with the evil than the good. It shocked me. But I
                  penetrated deeper and deeper into my own heart—into the iniquity of my soul, until
                  I despaired of ever sounding its depth. I then cried to God to have mercy on me.
                  He heard my prayer, and Jesus Christ came to my help. I felt that he had suffered
                  in my stead, and had poured out his blood as an atonement for my sins. I found
                  peace to my soul as I cast myself, a poor, helpless sinner, upon his atoning
                  altar, and bathed myself in his all cleansing blood."</p>
               <p>Mary could proceed no farther, for the tears began to flow too rapidly, and her
                  emotion might have been noticed by others than Albert.</p>
               <p>The wind, too, began to rise, and it blew so fresh that they retired to the cabin,
                  where Albert occupied himself with a game of chess, and Mary read, with evident
                  pleasure, such parts of her dearly-prized Bible which suited the state of her
                  mind, occasionally calling Albert's attention to some passage particularly
                  striking.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon, Mary took her seat in a position to enjoy the best view of the
                  western sky, in which floated, in all their gorgeousness, the variegated sun-lit
                  clouds.</p>
               <p>Albert soon joined her. "Well, Mary, you seem to be meditating; but allow me to
                  participate in the luxury of your reflections upon that splendid horizon."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Albert, I was thinking how much more impressive is such scenery than the
                  traveller on land enjoys. In the rapid succession of scenery and variety of faces,
                  as the coach or the steam car drives rapidly onward, everything one sees increases
                  the mind's confusion. Whatever he casts his eye upon, worthy of admiration,
                  attracts his attention but a moment; and the sublimity of mountain heights, the
                  gaudy decorations of fertile valleys, and the frowning grandeur of rocks, as they
                  cast their dark shadow upon some foaming torrent, flit by him as a dream of
                  twilight, and leave upon his memory only pencil outlines of the beautiful and the
                  sublime. Not so the voyager on the ocean. Here the beautiful imprints itself
                  ineffaceably in all its sparkling and its gorgeous variety upon the enchanted
                  mind, and the grand and the sublime raise such a tempest of wonder in the soul
                  that the ocean ever after rolls its foaming waves over the broad expanse of
                  memory."</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6562-00000044"/>
               <p>'Mary," said Albert, "these clouds, floating so gracefully on the ocean, and this
                  gorgeous horizon inspiring your poetic fancy, are something more than mere sky
                  drapery, for you'll perceive that the wind is becoming boisterous, and I fear we
                  are going to have a stormy night."</p>
               <p>"You do not feel alarmed, do you Albert?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot say I feel alarmed; but I would be more comfortable at this time if I
                  had not so precious a charge. There may be no real danger, but there can be no
                  harm in preparing for what might happen. If we should have a storm I wish you
                  would take your seat on that large box, so as to appropriate it and keep it. Your
                  father brought me two life-preservers and a good cord, when we came on board, and
                  charged me to use them in case of accident. You smile, Mary, at my earnestness,
                  and perhaps my love for you induces anxiety which circumstances do not warant.
                  Still you can keep in mind my directions."</p>
               <p>Albert walked towards the bow of the steamer, while Mary again fixed her attention
                  upon the variegated clouds. She did not participate in Albert's apprehensions, and
                  thought his anxiety needless. Yet his earnest request made that sort of impression
                  upon her mind which rather conduced to religious contemplation.</p>
               <p>The broad disk of the sun could be seen through the floating cloud, and as Albert
                  returned, Mary remarked:—"Albert, an hour ago I tried to look at the sun, but his
                  light dazzled my eyes to blindness. I could not mark its shape nor perceive its
                  beauty. But now the cloud floats before it, and through its light vapor I see the
                  sun's circular infinity, and admire its beauty and its glory undazzled by its
                  effulgence. So it is I see God through Christ, as he transmits the glory of his
                  Father. And it is by thus seeing God through Christ, instead of by the eyes of
                  intellect and mere mental observation, that I obtain hope in God and feel prepared
                  to enter upon the realities of that world which is eternally lighted by the
                  invisible presence of Jehovah. Seeing him in Christ Jesus, I feel an assurance of
                  his mercy, and am freed from those apprehensions which your scepticism and
                  distrust occasion yourself."</p>
               <p>"My dear Mary," replied Albert, "do not suppose my counsel to you originated in
                  any fear for myself personally. It may be from want of reflection, but really I do
                  not know what the fear of death is. Your<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6562-00000045"/>
                  safety, Mary, is the cause of my present anxiety. I do not doubt your preparation
                  for eternity, but I am not willing to resign you yet to the companionship of
                  angels. If you perish beneath these billows, and I survive, my hope for happiness
                  in this life is blasted. What is to be beyond the grave I know not; and my
                  religion concerns the life that now is. I must make the best of time, and leave
                  eternity to be taken account of when I am fairly launched into it. Perhaps
                  enjoying this world with you, I might learn from you to prepare for eternity. At
                  present my care must be to get my dear Mary safely over this treacherous
                  ocean."</p>
               <p>The sun now sank beneath the western horizon. The variegated colors of the sky
                  were rapidly commingling into one dense canopy of gloom.</p>
               <p>The passengers earnestly inquired of the captain about the prospect. He hoped to
                  run into the port of Wilmington, but he exhorted them to have brave hearts for the
                  danger was imminent. The storm was rapidly increasing. All urged that the pressure
                  of steam be increased to the utmost capacity of the boat.</p>
               <p>O, what an anxious crowd were upon the deck of that steamer, as they strained
                  their eyes towards the land, and anon lost their balance by the dashing of the
                  billows! The lightning played with terrific splendor, alternating with the
                  blackness of the heavens; and the roar of the waves was only hushed by the awful
                  artillery of the skies.</p>
               <p>Mary was sitting where Albert had directed, awaiting with great calmness the
                  result of the storm.</p>
               <p>Albert carefully fastened her with a cord to the box, having first placed beneath
                  her arms the life-preserver. Placing another life-preserver around himself, he
                  stood by Mary's side with watchful anxiety. Suddenly a heavy sea threw the boat
                  forcibly to one side, and Albert mechanically stretching forth his hand to save
                  himself, accidentally got caught in the rope that he had entwined about the box,
                  and with Mary was tossed into the sea and overwhelmed with the waves.</p>
               <p>The steamer was several hundred yards ahead of them before Albert succeeded in
                  adjusting his position to maintain a good hold upon the box. His first thought was
                  to examine how Mary was situated. The lightning gave him sufficient assurance that
                  she was alive and unhurt. At that moment a dreadful explosion directed their eyes
                  towards the steamer,<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6562-00000046"/> and the awful sight
                  was exhibited of their late associates blown into the air and then sinking beneath
                  the waves.</p>
               <p>The loss of the Pulaski has made many a flowing tear. But few were left to tell
                  the horrors of that night. The public are familiar with their description of the
                  sad disaster. But they knew not the fate of Albert and Mary, and only added them
                  to the catalogue of the lost</p>
               <p>It was with the greatest difficulty that Albert could afford his charge any aid,
                  and they must both soon have perished if the storm had been long protracted. But
                  fortunately, the wind shifting, the clouds were soon dispersed, and the stars
                  shone out brightly.</p>
               <p>Before morning they were rescued from their perilous situation, and found
                  themselves, on recovering from their exhaustion, in the comfortable cabin of a
                  fast-sailing brig. The storm, although exceedingly perilous to a steamboat, was
                  not such as to damage a well-trimmed vessel; and the brig, soon after the
                  explosion, bore down towards the wreck, and recovered from a watery grave the
                  interesting subjects of our narrative.</p>
               <p>Mary was taken on board in a state of entire unconsciousness, while Albert was too
                  much interested for her to make any special observation of the persons by whom
                  they were rescued.</p>
               <p>After seeing her sufficiently restored to animation to be left to repose, he
                  retired from her state-room and suffered himself to be assisted to a berth.</p>
               <p>The sun was high in the heavens when they were awaked from their slumber and
                  invited to breakfast. Every accommodation in the way of dry clothing was supplied
                  them, and they met in the saloon of the brig to embrace, in the transport of
                  grateful hearts.</p>
               <p>Having recovered their self-possession, they looked around for their deliverers.
                  None were in the saloon with them but a highly-accomplished looking lady and the
                  steward and stewardess.</p>
               <p>The lady saluted them in the blandest and most refined manner, and expressed her
                  sincere gratification that they had been so soon delivered from their perilous
                  situation, and were already so well recovered from their exhaustion.</p>
               <p>"To whom, Madam," said Albert, "are we indebted for these expressions of kindness
                  and tender solicitude?"</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6562-00000047"/>
               <p>"I am, sir, the wife of the captain and master of this brig. My husband will pay
                  you his respects as soon as you have partaken of some of this warm Java and these
                  hot rolls."</p>
               <p>"I would not," said Mary, "be doing justice to my own feelings were I to sit down
                  to breakfast without first asking your liberty, Madam, to read a beautiful psalm
                  which occurs to my mind at this moment."</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said the lady; "and, steward, invite the chaplain in to offer prayer.
                  Doubtless it will be perfectly agreeable to our young guests."</p>
               <p>A reverend and benevolent looking gentleman, in black, soon entered from the deck,
                  and, in the kindest manner and address, saluted the young couple, expressing, with
                  deep emotion, his sympathy with them and his anxiety in their behalf.</p>
               <p>Mary pointed out to him the Psalm she had selected. He read it; made a few
                  highly-appropriate comments, and, while all knelt, such a strain of grateful
                  praise and of fervent prayer flowed from the lips of the warm-hearted minister as
                  seldom is surpassed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gracelius, for this was the minister's name, was of the orthodox faith, and
                  had long been engaged in preaching the doctrines of the Calvinistic school. Yet he
                  was not bigoted or rigid. His heart was full of the milk of human kindness, and he
                  carried conviction to his hearers, not more by the strength of his logic than the
                  benignity of his address. He was just such a minister as the devout and
                  accomplished Mary St. Clair would have full confidence in. She was delighted to
                  think that she had been so fortunate as to meet such a friend and spiritual
                  counsellor at such a time; and she at once gave utterance to the warm feelings of
                  her heart, and begged that Mr. Gracelius would feel at perfect liberty to counsel
                  and advise her.</p>
               <p>"My advice then is, my dear young sister, that first of all you sit down to your
                  breakfast, and allow Mrs. Templeton to help you and the young gentleman to your
                  coffee."</p>
               <p>Albert and Mary could not but feel that they had fallen among true friends. And,
                  having eaten a cheerful breakfast, they both expressed their sincere gratitude to
                  their kind hostess, which she received with equally deep emotion.</p>
               <p>Captain Templeton now entered, and with great courteousness, blended with warmth
                  of address, gave his hand to Albert, and, with a graceful bow to Mary, expressed
                  the pleasure he felt in having rescued them<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6562-00000048"
                  /> from a watery grave. "And now, my young friends," said the Captain, "I wish you
                  to make yourselves perfectly at home in my vessel; and as soon as I can with
                  safety restore you to your friends, I shall do so."</p>
               <p>"Permit me to inquire," said Albert, "to what port you are destined?"</p>
               <p>"We do not go into any harbor in the United States," replied the Captain; "but
                  should we meet with a merchant vessel under favorable circumstances, you will be
                  placed on board."</p>
               <p>"Is not this a merchant vessel?" inquired Albert.</p>
               <p>"No, sir. This is an armed brig."</p>
               <p>"Of what nation?" asked Albert.</p>
               <p>The Captain smiled as, with a courteous bow, he replied, "We are pirates;" and
                  immediately went on deck, leaving Albert and Mary in perfect amazement.</p>
               <p>Recovering himself in a moment, Albert said to Mrs. Templeton: "Your husband is
                  very jocose!"</p>
               <p>"No, sir; he was serious in what he said. We are pirates. But you need be under no
                  apprehension of danger, nor feel the slightest alarm. I know that you have been
                  trained to believe that pirates are necessarily devoid of humane feelings, and are
                  ever thirsting for blood. But I trust we are as hospitable and kind a people to
                  our guests, as are to be found on land."</p>
               <p>Albert and Mary were indeed the guests of a piratical crew; but they were soon
                  relieved of all apprehension of personal danger; for there was that in the
                  deportment of all on board which satisfied them of a sincere desire to serve and
                  accommodate them in every way.</p>
               <p>A few days brought them into such intimacy with the crew that they spoke with
                  freedom, even on the subject of piracy. They were indeed astonished to find that
                  even Mr. Gracelius advocated the claims of pirates as a civilized and religious
                  people.</p>
               <p>On board the brig they had morning and evening prayers, and a lecture one evening
                  in the week, and two sermons on the Sabbath. What seemed particularly remarkable
                  was the sound evangelical faith of the Captain and his family, and the
                  unexceptionable doctrines that were preached by their minister. There was so much
                  fervor, earnestness, and pathos in the sermons of Mr. Gracelius, that Mary was
                  constrained to admit to Mrs. Templeton that she had never heard better.</p>
               <p>They had been on the brig about three weeks,<pb n="94-95"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000049"/> without any event calculated to disturb the
                  sensibilities of our young friends, beyond the unaccountably strange sentiments of
                  the piratical crew. Everything was conducted with so much order and propriety,
                  good taste and moral deportment, that they could scarcely believe at times
                  otherwise than that a mere sportive hoax was being played upon them.</p>
               <p>But the tranquil, social pastimes were now interrupted by a new scene of
                  action.</p>
               <p>It was a pleasant morning; a gentle breeze filled the sails. An unusual
                  arrangement of the vessel attracted the attention of Albert. Soon he observed men
                  at the guns, and Captain Templeton standing in a commanding position. The brig was
                  bearing down upon a French merchantman.</p>
               <p>Albert hastened to Mary, and disclosed to her the state of things. Mary at first
                  trembled, but soon composed herself with trust in God. Albert, taking her arm into
                  his, led her to where Captain Templeton was standing:</p>
               <p>"Captain," said Albert," I perceive you are bearing down upon that merchant
                  vessel. Is it your object to place us on board, or do you design to capture
                  her?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gillon," replied the Captain, "I shall see to it that you and your young
                  charge are safely provided for; and that you may be perfectly easy on that score.
                  I now inform you that when I take possession of that merchantman. I shall make
                  arrangements for you to be taken in her to a suitable port, whence you can find
                  your way to your friends. Be composed now, and pay such attention to Miss St.
                  Clair as the unusual occasion may seem in your judgment to require. In a few
                  moments we shall have something to do, and perhaps a necessity to use our guns.
                  But I hope not. If you will retire to the cabin, Mrs. Templeton will entertain you
                  there better than you are likely to be on deck."</p>
               <p>There was so much politeness in the Captain's manner, and yet evident fixedness of
                  purpose, that Albert attempted no answer. There was now no doubt that their
                  hospitable entertainers were pirates. They retired to the cabin, and sat there in
                  profound silence. Soon Mrs. Templeton came in, and in her gentle winning manner
                  began to prepare Mary for the scenes that might transpire.</p>
               <p>"You must not be alarmed, my dear. You will be perfectly safe. I only regret we
                  are so soon likely to lose your company."</p>
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6562-00000050"/>
               <p>"O Mrs. Templeton!" said Mary, "how can you prosecute such a life! It is so
                  wicked! Excuse me, ma'am, but I cannot suppress my feelings of horror."</p>
               <p>At this moment the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Captain
                  Templeton, who, with a calm countenance, said:—</p>
               <p>"Wife, I perceive that there are several guns on that vessel, and I judge that the
                  crew and passengers are somewhat numerous. We shall have to proceed with caution,
                  and as we are likely to have somewhat of a warm time, I think I should feel better
                  satisfied to have a season of prayer."</p>
               <p>Albert knit his brow in moody silence. Mary heaved a deep sigh. Mr. Gracelius was
                  called in, and having read the 20th Psalm, he offered up the following
                  prayer:—</p>
               <p>"Oh! Thou mighty God of Jacob, who didst accompany Thine ancient Israel through
                  all their trials, and didst fight their battles for them, we thank Thee that Thou
                  hast taught us to put our trust in Thee. And we beseech Thee, oh! blessed Father,
                  for the sake of Thine own Son Jesus Christ, to help us at this time in our
                  endeavor to appropriate to the support of this branch of thy Zion, the treasures
                  which, for the mere purposes of an unhallowed commerce, are being transported to
                  that people who have ever distinguished themselves by their infidelity, and by
                  their scorn of all true religion; who have also by their mighty leaders devastated
                  kingdoms and shed seas of blood to gratify a vain-glorious ambition.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Lord, we would not shed blood needlessly, and we therefore pray Thee to
                  enable us in the approaching conflict, to have a single eye to Thy glory, and thus
                  preserve a calm and kind temper, whatsoever may be the resistance offered on this
                  occasion. And wilt Thou, O Lord, assist our beloved captain to do his duty, and to
                  so command his men and order the battle, that when all shall be over, he may have
                  a conscience void of offence towards God and towards man. And whatsoever treasures
                  may come to us, may we gratefully employ in Thy service and to Thy glory,
                  remembering that Jesus Christ, who died for us and rose again for our
                  justification, first became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich,
                  and therefore that we ought to use our wealth to the advancement of Christianity
                  in our own souls and among our fellow-beings, as the best evidence of our
                  gratitude for our earthly prosperity, and for those<pb n="98-99"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000051"/> treasures which are laid up for us in heaven; and
                  to Thy gracious name, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, be the praise forever.
                     <emph>Amen.</emph>"</p>
               <p>The tone of the chaplain's voice, the fervid manner and the striking pathos of
                  this short prayer, had a strong effect upon Captain Templeton and his wife. They
                  both rose from their knees with tears in their eyes.</p>
               <p>The Captain grasped the hand of Mr. Gracelius, and earnestly said: "I feel
                  strengthened, my brother; and I can now say, If the Lord be for us, who can be
                  against us!" He then passed out and resumed his position on the deck.</p>
               <p>"Miss St. Clair," said Mrs. Templeton, "do you think that can be wickedness which
                  the Lord sanctifies with his communion?"</p>
               <p>Before Mary could reply, the loud report of a cannon gave notice that the action
                  had commenced.</p>
               <p>The struggle was a short one, the French vessel was captured, with the loss of her
                  commander, who fell at the first fire. It took but a short time to have all on the
                  merchantman in fetters, and the vessel manned by the pirates.</p>
               <p>It was not until the morning after the capture that matters became composed on the
                  pirates' vessel, and everything in usual order.</p>
               <p>At breakfast Mary took the liberty to ask the Captain what he designed to do with
                  his prisoners.</p>
               <p>"I always endeavor," he replied, "to remember the obligations of humanity and
                  Christianity. Sometimes, for our own safety, we are compelled to put our captives
                  to death, but I do so always with great reluctance, and never without prayer to
                  God that their souls might be saved. In this case I think we shall not be under
                  this, painful necessity."</p>
               <p>"Captain," said Albert, "it is perfectly unaccountable to me how a man of your
                  naturally humane and benevolent disposition can engage in this business of robbery
                  and murder."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Gillon," replied the Captain, "I make every allowance for one who has
                  been educated as you have been, and taught that pirates were only worthy of the
                  gallows; although I cannot but feel that your language is not such as your refined
                  and polished manners would warrant me to expect and require. Our business is not
                  robbery and murder. The laws under which we live, both social and political<pb
                     n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6562-00000052"/> cal, are as decidedly opposed to such
                  crimes as among any other people."</p>
               <p>"I did not," replied Albert, "intend to be ungentlemanly in my language, and was
                  not aware that these terms were offensive to you. But, sir, you only increase my
                  amazement. I cannot comprehend how you can characterize your business by terms
                  more appropriate. Is it not so that piracy is but the practice of robbery and
                  murder, when it takes away a man's possessions, and then destroys his life to make
                  the booty secure?"</p>
               <p>"I perceive, Mr. Gillon, that you labor under the delusion that all pirates are
                  bad and cruel men. I confess, sir, there are many of our people who treat their
                  prisoners with unnecessary severity, and frequently inflict death when the
                  occasion does not demand it. But, my dear sir, this is the abuse of piracy, not
                  its legitimate use."</p>
               <p>"And do you really mean to say, Captain Templeton," said Mary, "that piracy can be
                  made an honorable business?"</p>
               <p>"Of course I do, miss," replied the Captain, "and I regret that Miss St. Clair can
                  suppose I would engage in a business that I did not believe to be honorable."</p>
               <p>"But, Captain, you profess to be a Christian, and it is a great mystery to me how
                  you can reconcile your profession with your practice. Surely you do not believe
                  that the Scriptures justify such a life."</p>
               <p>"That is precisely my belief, Miss," replied the Captain. "Piracy is a Bible
                  institution, and if it were not so, I would abandon it at once."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said Albert, "that accounts for it. It is that belief in the Bible that
                  leads the mind and the heart astray from the clear principles of a sound moral
                  philosophy. Even my good Mary, here, is so warped by her reverence for the Bible,
                  that she defends the institution of slavery, which I abhor with all my heart. But,
                  Captain, although I am not surprised at your belief that the Bible sanctions
                  piracy, since it is quoted by Christians in support of all sorts of wickedness, I
                  am surprised that a man of your good sense and keen moral perception in regard to
                  other matters of life, should not perceive that slavery, and piracy, and war, and
                  everything of the sort, are irreconcilable with sound morality."</p>
               <p>"I do not know," replied the Captain, "what might be the conclusions of abstract
                  reasoning upon the subject outside of the Bible, for I have never<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000053"/> thought very profoundly about it. But I feel
                  satisfied so long as I have the assurance that the revealed Word is on my
                  side."</p>
               <p>"But, Captain," said Mary, "I am not willing to allow that the Bible is on your
                  side. It shocks me to hear you say so."</p>
               <p>"Well, Miss St. Clair, I must turn you over to brother Gracelius, who is well
                  posted up in Bible matters. He will be able to show you that piracy is a Bible
                  institution."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my young sister," said Mr. Gracelius, who had not been inattentive to the
                  conversation, while he was enjoying an excellent cup of coffee. "The Scriptures do
                  most certainly sanction the institution of piracy."</p>
               <p>Here Mr. Gracelius took from his pocket a small Bible, and proceeded to say: "On
                  such a question, I am strongly disposed to pass by all ethical and metaphysical
                  dissertation, and appeal at once to the only standard of right and wrong which can
                  prove decisive. It is the responses of the sacred oracles to which we must after
                  all appeal."</p>
               <p>"I could wish, Mr. Gracelius," said Albert, "that you would discuss this question
                  rather upon the foundation dation principles of morality, than by arguments from a
                  volume which sanctions war, slavery, death penalties, and a host of other evils,
                  by the very confessions of Christians themselves."</p>
               <p>"I perceive," said Mr. Gracelius, "that you, sir, have never yet learned the true
                  grace of God through regeneration, or you too would bow submissively to the
                  teachings of the sacred Scriptures, and acknowledge them as the highest standard
                  of right and morality. I cannot, therefore, hope to seriously affect your mind by
                  an appeal to the Bible. But Miss St. Clair, being a Christian, will feel the force
                  of such high authority."</p>
               <p>"Truly, Mr. Gracelius," said Mary, "I do take the Bible as my highest standard of
                  truth; and it is from the principles taught by the Bible that I have the assurance
                  that piracy is awfully criminal. And I am utterly astonished that a man of your
                  apparent piety, and who so well understands the doctrines of Christianity, can for
                  a moment think that the Bible justifies such crimes."</p>
               <p>"My dear young sister," said the minister, "you are begging the question when you
                  call piracy a crime, for that is the very thing you are to prove. But let us see
                  what piracy is:</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6562-00000054"/>
               <p>"In order to clear away rubbish, and to arrive at once at the point, let me remind
                  you that it is simply the <emph>essential</emph> character of piracy which we are
                  discussing. Piracy itself is nothing more than the appropriating of the products
                  of another's labor and skill, without his consent or contract. The absence of the
                  contract, or the consent of the producer, does not alter the nature and extent of
                  the pirates' right. The case is analogous to that of parents and children. A
                  father has a right to the productions of his child's labor during his minority,
                  without the contract or consent of the child, and he may even transfer that right.
                  But I grant that this does not justify the father in doing anything to the
                  detriment of the child, either morally, intellectually, or physically. And, beyond
                  doubt, this is the true light in which Christianity would have pirates regard
                  their relations. The capture of a vessel, and the treatment of prisoners, involve
                  a great responsibility. Nothing more should be done than is absolutely essential
                  to the maintenance of the peculiar institutions of piracy. It is not the relation
                  of the pirate to the producer or prisoner which is sinful, but infidelity to the
                  solemn trust which that relation creates. It does not follow, because he has a
                  right to the produce of another's labor or skill, that he has also a right to
                  inflict unnecessary violence on his person, or take from him all means of
                  livelihood. Whenever it can be done, without jeopardizing the well-being and
                  interests of our society and institutions, we ought to spare the prisoner's life,
                  make him comfortable while in our hands, place him as soon as possible where he
                  can return to his home, and leave him means enough to keep him from starving or
                  absolute destitution.</p>
               <p>"To include in the idea of piracy, that also of robbery and murder, is to confound
                  two things entirely distinct, and which really have no sort of connection. If I
                  take from another that which I have no right to by the laws of the society or
                  government under which I live, then I am a robber; for that alone is property
                  which the law makes property, as one of your own great statesmen has very properly
                  said; and if I take life, when not essential to maintain my own rights under the
                  laws of that government which I recognize in my social obligations, I am a
                  murderer. I therefore insist upon it, that, in discussing this subject, we regard
                  as appropriate to the question only the essential elements of piracy, and not its
                  abuses; for<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6562-00000055"/> piracy may exist without
                  inflicting these aggravated wrongs.</p>
               <p>"Christian pirates have great regard for the welfare, temporal and spiritual, of
                  their fellow-beings, and oftentimes exercise the spirit of the most self-denying
                  missionaries. Such men and women do honor to human nature. They are the true
                  friends of their race.</p>
               <p>"Now, here is piracy—a system of society and government which gives opportunity to
                  inculcate among graceless men who fall into our hands the principles of the Gospel
                  of Christ; and many an ungodly man has had the opportunity in our cabin of hearing
                  the doctrines of the cross, who, whilst immersed in the business, and cares, and
                  pleasures of life, never darkened the door of a meeting-house on land. And many of
                  them have been converted to the Christian faith, and have become excellent and
                  worthy Christian pirates.</p>
               <p>"Those of our captains who have Christian sailors under them have the best-managed
                  vessels; and really their crews do more of effective work, both in battle and in
                  ship duties, than any ungodly crew that can be found.</p>
               <p>"No, Sister Mary, depend upon it, you have imbibed a prejudice against piracy, and
                  you suppose it to involve all sorts of crime. But the true question of issue
                  between us is pruned to this:—Is it necessarily a crime in the sight of God to
                  control the property, or curtail the personal liberty, or take the life of a human
                  being in any case?</p>
               <p>"Every government has necessarily a right to pass laws indispensable to its
                  existence; and it has a right, also, to establish those regulations which shall
                  best promote the good of the whole population. Now, what political organization is
                  most desirable for a particular people, depends on circumstances; but, whatever be
                  that adopted, whether democracy, or despotism, or piratical confederation, the
                  rights of man, as a human being, are trenched upon; and visionary have proved and
                  will prove all projects of constructing and fashioning society according to
                  philosophical notions and theories of abstract unalienable rights. That piracy or
                  any civil institution interferes with the property of a man, or a class of men
                  (as, for instance, merchants), does not then make it necessarily, and, amid all
                  circumstances, a crime."</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6562-00000056"/>
               <p>Mr. Gracelius here paused, and gave Mary an opportunity to put in a word.</p>
               <p>"But," said she, "after taking off what you call the rubbish, Mr. Gracelius, and
                  pruning the question down as much as you please, I cannot possibly admit that the
                  Bible anywhere justifies piracy under any circumstances whatsoever, either
                  abstractly or practically. I call upon you for anything in all the Bible that
                  gives the slightest countenance to such a mode of life, or such a government, as
                  you are pleased to term it."</p>
               <p>"I should rather require of you, replied the learned divine, "to make out from the
                  Bible your charge that piracy is a crime. I know not a word from the first of
                  Genesis to the end of Revelation where piracy is once condemned. But I pass this,
                  and, waiving my clear logical rights, undertake to prove the negative, and to show
                  that the Bible does, most explicitly, both by precept and example, bear me out in
                  my assertion, that piracy is not necessarily, and always, and amidst all
                  circumstances, a sin. WHAT GOD SANCTIONED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, AND PERMITTED IN
                  THE NEW, CANNOT BE SIN.</p>
               <p>"I begin with the patriarch Jacob, whose name Israel has been appropriated from
                  his day to this time to the true church. How did Jacob acquire his great riches?
                  Was it not by appropriating the property of Laban to himself? And did not God
                  bless him in thus doing? There is not a word of condemnation; but, on the
                  contrary, Jacob, in telling his brother that he had much property, remarked, that
                  God had dealt graciously with him. Here, you see, is a marked case of an
                  appropriation of another's property by a very adroit stratagem, which is fully
                  justified by the Old Testament, and uncondemned by the New.</p>
               <p>"Had Jacob not represented in his person a different community from Laban's, of
                  which he was to be the Patriarch, his mode of acquiring wealth out of Laban would
                  have been censurable. But his conduct towards Laban was consistent with what was
                  subsequently allowed under the Mosaic laws on the part of the Jews towards other
                  nations. They could, for instance, make slaves of the nations round about;—they
                  could take usury of them;—they could despoil them by war, and they could do a
                  variety of things in relation to the people of other nations which would have been
                  robbery, fraud, murder, and so on, if done<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000057"/> by Jews to Jews. Thus the idea that that is
                  property which the law makes property, is of divine origin.</p>
               <p>"Take now the case of the Israelites in their exodus from Egypt; they were
                  positively enjoined by the Divine command to borrow of their Egyptian neighbors
                  their various costly jeweleries, not with the idea of returning them, but of
                  appropriating them permanently to their own benefit.</p>
               <p>"David, who was a man after God's own heart, did not regard it robbery to obtain
                  from the Priest the shew-bread itself, although to do so he deceived the Priest by
                  telling that which, under other circumstances, would be called a lie. It was
                  essential to his life—to his support. It was not therefore criminal to tell the
                  falsehood in order to obtain the bread. Now, it is upon this very principle that
                  your government and all civil governments employ diplomatic agents, in order to
                  secure by adroitness and craftiness commercial and other advantages; and it is
                  upon the same principle that we pirates justify our proceedings. It is essential
                  to the support and maintenance of our people; and there is as much in the
                  Scriptures to warrant our stratagems to decoy vessels and get the benefit of their
                  cargoes, as for your government to obtain advantages by diplomatic adroitness. We
                  must have a living.</p>
               <p>"But you say we not only rob but murder. But as all appropriations of others'
                  possessions are not essentially robbery, so all killing is not essentially murder.
                  If you will look into the Book of Judges, xiv. 19, you will find that the taking
                  of spoil even by violence and bloodshed, is not necessarily a crime—is not
                  necessarily robbery and murder. It is the case of Samson when he had to give
                  thirty changes of raiment to those who had expounded his riddle. It is said: "And
                  the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to Askelon and slew thirty
                  men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which
                  expounded the riddle." Now, notice this particularly, that Samson did all this
                  under the influence of God's Spirit. And you will remember that Paul in Hebrews
                  mentions Samson with special commendation.</p>
               <p>"Now, if Samson, and David, and Jacob did such things, we feel justified in
                  proceeding accordingly.</p>
               <p>"But as I have not time to go into very minute detail, I pass at once to two very
                  important points in<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6562-00000058"/> the New Testament.
                  The first occurs in Christ's parable of the unjust steward. There the steward is
                  commended for making an arrangement by which he secured his permanent interest by
                  adroitly subtracting from what was due his Lord by his debtors. He had acted
                  unjustly in the office of steward, being bound by honor to fulfil its duties and
                  his obligations to his employer, but so soon as his obligations to his employer
                  ceased on being ordered out of the stewardship, and his very living cut off, then
                  it was no longer unjust, but commendable to do that which before would have been
                  fraud or robbery.</p>
               <p>"The other case is that of our blessed Lord himself. He sent his disciples to take
                  away from the place where they were tied an ass and her colt; and he told them how
                  to escape should they be caught at it, by saying: 'The Lord hath need of them.'
                  Now, when we take away the property of others, we may reply to those who question
                  us, 'The Lord hath need of them,' for every good pirate will endeavor so to use
                  what he obtains as to promote the best interests of religion, and to glorify our
                  blessed Redeemer.</p>
               <p>"And now, my dear young sister, what more need I say to establish the point that
                  piracy is not essentially tially sinful—that it is not <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >malum in se?</foreign> Indeed, it stands upon the same footing that slavery
                  does, and is vindicated by the same process of reasoning. The argument for slavery
                  is identically the same in principle as for piracy. And you know it is upon the
                  ground that slavery is not under all circumstances a sin, that Christians in the
                  Northern States hold communion with you of the South. And I admire that charitable
                  spirit which induces them to believe that Southern Christians do not uphold the
                  barbarous features which wicked and cruel masters impress upon the system of
                  slavery. They give you, therefore, very properly, the right hand of Christian
                  fellowship, which they could not do if slaveholding were sin in itself. And I
                  doubt not they would as readily commune with Christrian pirates, since it is
                  evident that piracy is not, any more than slavery, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">malum
                     in se.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>Mary made no reply, but sat musing with a countenance overwhelmed with
                  sadness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gracelius looked as though he had accomplished a decided victory; and Captain
                  Templeton smiled with approbation.</p>
               <p>Albert after a short silence exclaimed with great emphasis: "I thank God
                     <emph>my</emph> Bible is my <emph>reason,</emph> my<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000059"/>
                  <emph>conscience,</emph> and my <emph>heart.</emph> I this day glory in being an
                  infidel."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Albert, Albert!" cried Mary, and burst into tears.</p>
               <p>Albert seeing he had wounded the feelings of one he loved so dearly, tried to
                  soothe her by remarking that he had met at the North with some persons who
                  maintained that the Bible was misunderstood and misinterpreted by the most of the
                  commentators and theologians, and that when rightly explained and received, would
                  be found to be perfectly in harmony with the sympathies and philanthropic emotions
                  of the human heart, and with the principles of enlightened reason. But as these
                  persons were generally called fanatical and visionary, he had not paid much
                  attention to their strictures. "I intend, however," he added, "to take an early
                  opportunity to investigate the Bible for myself, and if it prove itself to be
                  better than its commentators and expounders, perhaps I shall become a Christian.
                  But I cannot be a Christian if Christianity props up slaveholding and piracy."</p>
               <p>Here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a messenger, who
                  announced that every preparation had been made, and that Mr. Gillon and Miss St.
                  Clair could now go on board the merchant vessel. On rising to depart. Albert with
                  much feeling addressed the Captain:</p>
               <p>"Captain Templeton, we are much indebted to you for saving our lives, and for the
                  hospitality and very kind attentions we have received. I would that I could repay
                  you in some way. But you will pardon me, so young a man, for expressing the
                  profound wish of my heart, that you would abandon this horrible life, and no
                  longer delude yourself with the idea that the Bible is the highest authority for
                  the regulation of man's life. Recognize every man, everywhere, as your brother,
                  and treat all as you have treated Mary and myself,—treat all as your own heart,
                  left to its most benevolent promptings, would dictate, and (the Bible to the
                  contrary notwithstanding) you will please God better than you can do by any
                  adherence to theological dogmas, that make the Almighty the author of piracy,
                  slavery, war, death-penalties, and such like institutions and practices."</p>
               <p>"And I, too, hope," replied Captain Templeton, "that you will look into this
                  matter with care, and come to the conclusion to follow that good book rather than
                  the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ignis fatuus</foreign> of mere human reason<pb
                     n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6562-00000060"/> and natural conscience. I admire your
                  honesty and candor, Mr. Gillon, and, although I cannot but regard your views as
                  fanatical, I trust that when the ardor of youth shall give place to the
                  reflections of maturer years, you will be as firm a believer in the Bible as I
                  am."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said Mr. Gracelius, "that will depend upon the grace of God. Farewell, young
                  man, and may the Lord convert your soul and give us a happy meeting again, where
                  we shall sing the song of the Lamb forever and ever."</p>
               <p>Mary, still in tears, took Mr. Gracelius by the hand and said:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gracelius, I am not at all convinced that the Scriptures favor your views,
                  although I am not prepared to meet your arguments. But I fear you have so
                  confirmed Albert in his infidelity, that it will be exceedingly hard to get him
                  hereafter even to listen to Christian instruction."</p>
               <p>"Oh! my young sister," replied the minister, "the grace of God can conquer the
                  worst of infidels, and I hope your friend will yet become an ambassador of
                  Christ."</p>
               <p>By this time the party were standing on deck, ready to bid the last adieu. Our
                  young friends were soon on board the merchant vessel and out of sight of their
                  strange benefactors.</p>
               <p>They found that the pirates had liberated the crew and passengers, and returned
                  them to their vessel, retaining only the rich cargo.</p>
               <p>Having been well supplied with funds, in gold, when they left home, which Albert
                  had about his person when taken up by the pirates, they found no difficulty, on
                  reaching France, in making their way to England, and thence to the United
                  States.</p>
               <p>On the voyages Albert perused the Scriptures with great attention, not only
                  because Mary had urged him to do so, but because he felt that he needed to be
                  informed of the true nature and character of what was claimed to be sacred
                  writings. He was careful to avoid conversation on the subject during the progress
                  of his investigations; and Mary herself was not, after her last interview with Mr.
                  Gracelius, sufficiently quieted in her own mind to give expression to her
                  thoughts.</p>
               <p>It was in November, when an Indian summer was augmenting the beauty of the scenery
                  about the harbor of New York, that our young friends were sitting<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000061"/> together in Mary's spacious state-room on board the
                  noble vessel which was just passing Staten Island.</p>
               <p>"Albert," said Mary, with deep emotion, and the tear in her eye, "I have become an
                  Abolitionist."</p>
               <p>"And I," said Albert, with yet deeper emphasis, "have become a Christian."</p>
               <p>"Thank God—thank God!" exclaimed Mary. "O, Albert, I cannot tell you how happy I
                  am to hear you say so. But I do not need any explanation, for I see through it
                  all. The pirates have made me an Abolitionist, and the Bible has made you a
                  Christian. I have now learned how to understand its teachings, and you have
                  learned that the precious volume has been grievously tortured to uphold the evil
                  instead of the good."</p>
               <p>"It is even so, Mary," replied Albert. "I have been reading and studying with an
                  earnest desire for truth. I find much, in the Old Testament, calculated to
                  bewilder, and much that requires the New Testament to explain. I find, scattered
                  through the Old Testament, holy principles that are brought into full relief by
                  Jesus Christ, who has, by his example, and in his instructions to his disciples,
                  elucidated what was obscure and rejected from the claims of divine authority what
                  was only Jewish misconception. I am satisfied that it does not uphold violence,
                  oppression, and wrong, and throw around these things the sanction of the divine
                  mind. I find that everything taught by Jesus Christ is in full harmony with the
                  most benevolent and honorable feelings of the human heart, and with the highest
                  sense of justice and consciousness of right, and is diametrically opposed to all
                  base carnal passions and affections, and to all that is violative of human
                  equality and brotherhood.</p>
               <p>"I believe in Jesus Christ. And I had the ideal of such a Saviour for man before I
                  saw that the Jesus of the New Testament is the true Captain of Salvation. And now
                  I find that such a Saviour really exists, I am willing to follow his leadings,
                  although I know it will require self-denials and sacrifices. I tell you, Mary, I
                  found out from reading the Bible that I was an unregenerated man, and needed God's
                  spirit to purify and sanctify my heart; and I have learned this from studying
                  carefully the life and doctrines of Christ, who, in the flesh, gave a full
                  manifestation of the godhead, and by <emph>his righteousness</emph> brought to my
                  own view <emph>my unrighteousness.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"I read of Jesus dying on the cross rather than not<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000062"/> carry out every jot and every tittle of the divine
                  morality, and every principle of pure and undefiled religion. I stand in
                  admiration of this divine heroism. I learn farther that his great mission was to
                  induce sinful man to abandon his sins and become reconciled to God; and that it
                  was in carrying out this mission that he subjected himself to the tortures of the
                  cross. Under the influence of God's Spirit, this brings me to true repentance, and
                  I determine to reform by taking Jesus as my exemplar and the captain of my
                  salvation. I am thus made reconciled to God's law, and feel pardoned for the past
                  and hopeful for the future. My faith in Christ gives me strength to live the life
                  of a Christian, and thus I am saved. Jesus Christ's death has in this way
                  reconciled me to God, and being thereby brought into harmony with God, God is
                  reconciled to me. Jesus Christ therefore making atonement or reconciliation for
                  me, has truly suffered in my stead. That is to say, his suffering in order to
                  impress me with my obligations to God and his law, has by reconciling me to God's
                  law, kept me from suffering the penalty of law. And when I think that God made
                  this provision for this fallen world—that he gave his only begotten Son, that
                  whosoever believeth lieveth in him should not perish but have eternal life, and I
                  realize it all with trust and confidence, I feel that the kingdom of heaven is
                  within me. I am truly happy."</p>
               <p>"My dear Albert," responded Mary, "you make me to see all this in a new light. I
                  confess I never before properly understood the doctrine of the atonement. I did
                  not before understand that atonement for man, and reconciliation between God and
                  man, were one and the same thing. But I now perceive that there is no atonement
                  unless we become Christ-like; and that just in proportion as we are Christ-like,
                  we are in harmony with God, and are thus far saved. God converts the soul from the
                  love of sin to the love of Christ, and that love of Christ insures obedience to
                  his commandments to the full measure of our knowledge. To be clothed upon then
                  with the righteousness of Christ, and to have Christ's righteousness imputed to
                  us, are not terms signifying a righteousness extraneous from ourselves, and only
                  regarded in place of righteousness in us, but really and truly to manifest a
                  righteousness which will be seen and recognized by our ownselves and others as a
                  righteousness derived from Christ, because we live as Christ<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000063"/> would have us to live. O how pleasant it is to see
                  the matter in so clear a light!"</p>
               <p>"And now," said Albert, "I wish to know how it is you a little while ago called
                  yourself an Abolitionist. Did you really mean what you said in its full
                  import?"</p>
               <p>"Yes I did," replied Mary. "That argument made by Mr. Gracelius was so exactly
                  similar to the mode of interpreting the Scriptures in behalf of slavery, that I at
                  once saw if it were good for slavery, it was just as good in defence of piracy;
                  and that I must give up the Bible under such a mode of interpretation, or admit
                  that piracy itself is sanctioned by the Bible. I could not give up my precious
                  Bible, for I have felt so much of its hallowed influences upon my soul, that I
                  could not think of parting from it. I have, like yourself, spent this voyage
                  studying it with great care, and whatever may be the criticisms of the learned
                  upon words, I am certain that the whole spirit of Christianity, as developed
                  before and since Christ, utterly condemns any and every system, or practice, or
                  principle which does not recognize all men as brethren. And I also perceive that
                  many things have been wrested from their original meaning to subserve the purposes
                  of oppression and tyranny. I now so read that good book, that I discriminate
                  between the erroneous ideas and practices of the Jews and the divine law—between
                  historical facts and traditional inferences—between man's misconceptions and the
                  true principles of religion. I now can and do see from the Bible itself that
                  slavery is all wrong; and being so, I am obliged to be an Abolitionist; for I know
                  that no Christian ought to continue the practice of what is wrong in itself on any
                  consideration. But, Albert, how was it that you who did not believe in the Bible,
                  became an Abolitionist?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Mary, the truth is, I did not believe in the Bible, because, being an
                  Abolitionist, professed Christians and ministers instructed me that the Bible
                  sanctioned slavery, and that it required obedience to earthly masters and rulers,
                  even although their commands and laws be contrary to the divine law. This was so
                  contrary to my sense of natural right, that I said to myself I cannot honor the
                  true God by submitting to the authority of the Bible; and therefore it was I took
                  an utter aversion to the Bible. My respect for my parents prevented me from
                  telling them when they would urge me to read the Bible,<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000064"/> that their own views and practice had already
                  convinced me that it was an unrighteous book; for I could not believe that my
                  father would hold slaves under any conviction of its rightfulness drawn from
                  nature, and that my mother would treat the blacks as she did, had she been
                  governed by her natural sense of justice; but that by early education in the
                  Bible, they had been trained to regard slaveholding perfectly compatible with the
                  divine law, and the black as some heathenish being, whom it was no oppression to
                  enslave. But now having examined the Bible with care, I see that they who take
                  that Book to justify the enslaving of men, have been most dreadfully deluded."</p>
               <p>"Well, Albert," said Mary, "you know the obligations of Christianity require
                  action as well as sentiment. If we are Christians truly, we have to serve Christ
                  fully. We dare not, therefore, withhold our testimony against slavery any more
                  than against any other crime. How then can we return to Carolina? We cannot be
                  happy there amidst an institution which we abhor."</p>
               <p>"Mary, like yourself, I now feel," said Albert, "that a Christian must not hide
                  his light under a bushel. We must speak for the dumb and for the truth as it is in
                  Jesus. But with such views and intentions we would not be suffered in South
                  Carolina. What, then, are we to do?"</p>
               <p>Mary, after a few moments' meditation, answered, "Albert, our parents think we
                  were lost with the Pulaski. Let it stand so. They will suffer more if we go back
                  to them with such sentiments as we now entertain. And for your sake, and for our
                  parents' sake, and for the sake of Christ, I am willing to sacrifice all my
                  worldly prospects and try to make a living by my own exertions in some place where
                  my own feelings will not be shocked with the perpetual violation of Christian law
                  by my own slave-holding relatives, and where I shall not be myself an annoyance to
                  them."</p>
               <p>Here their dialogue was interrupted by the arrival of the ship at the wharf, and
                  in a short time our young friends were safely landed in New York.</p>
               <p>Suffice it to say, in conclusion, that they both agreed never more to be dependent
                  on the wealth of their parents,—assured as they were that all they could bestow
                  upon them would be the product of unrequited toil. They were soon united in holy
                  wedlock, and,<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6562-00000065"/> after engaging in
                  teaching an academy a short time, Albert became a faithful and zealous minister of
                  the gospel; and he and his loving wife in process of time succeeded in revealing
                  their situation to their parents, in such terms as to reconcile them to their
                  anti-slavery views, and to induce them finally to emancipate their slaves.</p>
               <p>They are all living happily in moderate circumstances, in a little town in one of
                  the free States,—in the direct line of the "under-ground railroad;" and many a
                  poor fugitive finds a comfortable shelter in either of their humble cottages.</p>
               <p>A short time since, Mary was reading the discussion between Dr. Wayland and Dr.
                  Fuller, on the subject of slavery, and was startled to find the very words of Mr.
                  Gracelius and his identical argument, used by the champion of American
                  slavery.</p>
               <p>"Albert," said she to her husband, "would you believe it, Dr. Fuller and Mr.
                  Gracelius are one and the same person."</p>
               <p>"It surely cannot be!" said Albert. But to this day the matter looks very
                  mysterious to them. And it is hoped that Dr. Fuller or Dr. Wayland will explain
                  plain the coincidence of the arguments in some satisfactory manner.</p>

               <head>Toil and Trust.</head>
               <p>THIS is the motto of all persons sincerely disposed to embrace the cross of the
                  anti-slavery enterprise. The duty it imposes is two-fold; 1. To <emph>toil</emph>
                  for the spread of the truth; and 2. To <emph>trust</emph> to the dissipation of
                  error. The most potent barrier set up against the opponents of slavery is made of
                  the prejudices carefully instilled into the popular mind against them. I propose,
                  in brief, to point out their origin.</p>
               <p>It is sedulously inculcated:</p>
               <p>1. That anti-slavery is a pure sectional feeling, and springs from jealousy of the
                  South.</p>
               <p>Fifty years ago this idea might fairly have been entertained. Many of the
                  arguments then used have no better root than political jealousy. But it is not so
                  now. The ruling objection at present is, that slavery is WRONG, no matter where it
                  may be found; that it is a moral evil, and an offence against religion, not less
                  than a great political curse; that indifference to it among good men encourages
                  its extension among bad men; and that nothing but resolute and universal
                  condemnation of it in every form will stimulate to its abolition. How far these
                  views are from jealousy of the South, must appear obvious enough to all who
                  reflect that those who entertain them, consider the result to be arrived at as one
                  which must spring from the voluntary convictions of those most affected by it,
                  that they are getting rid of the only serious drawback to their own prosperity. Of
                  course, then, it is the best interests of the South,—their strength, moral,
                  social, and political,—that anti-slavery men believe they are promoting, by their
                  course.</p>
               <p>2. That the enemies of slavery desire to subvert the Constitution and to dissolve
                  the Union.</p>
               <p>Possibly, a few impatient spirits may have got so far. They constitute, however,
                  but a very small portion of the number included in the term. Nine-tenths of these
                  hold that neither the Constitution nor the Union should be brought into question
                  at all. They consider that the resort to them as a protection and safeguard to
                  slavery, by ill-judging and rash<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6562-00000067"/>
                  conservatives, has done more to put them into serious danger, than the acts of all
                  others combined during the present century. Any man who relies upon a good
                  government to sustain acknowledged evil, does much to modify the notions of
                  goodness which honest and conscientious men have entertained respecting that
                  government. He furnishes an entering wedge for doubt and distrust, which, if not
                  removed, will grow into aversion. Anti-slavery men reason differently. They
                  separate slavery from the Constitution and the Union, and, by seeking to destroy
                  the former, desire to perpetuate the latter. They hold, that against the
                  concentrated moral sentiment of the whole country, acting through its legitimate
                  public channels, and aided by the prayers and the hopes of all the civilized
                  world, it would be much more difficult to maintain slavery in the States, than if
                  the dangers of general misgovernment and disunion were to come in to distract the
                  public attention, and open up social disasters of a worse kind than those which
                  they seek to remedy.</p>
               <p>3. The spirit of this reform is denunciatory, violent, and proscriptive.</p>
               <p>It is inevitable that all movements directed against the established errors of
                  communities originate with men more or less fanatical in spirit. None but they
                  have the necessary elements of character to advance at all. But, as others become
                  convinced of the fundamental truths which they utter, the tendency of their
                  association is to modify and soften the tone, and make it more nearly approximate
                  the correct sentiment. At this period, there is quite as much of liberality among
                  anti-slavery men as is consistent with a determined maintenance of their general
                  purpose. Though disposed to be just to all who conscientiously differ with them in
                  opinion, they cannot overlook the fact that many honest persons are too
                  indifferent, and more are too compromising in their views of slavery. To rouse the
                  one, and alarm the other class into a conviction of their responsibility for their
                  apathy, is one of the most imperative duties. It may be that this is not always
                  done in the most courtly or the choicest terms. Some allowances must be made for
                  the spirit of liberty. These cases form, however, the exception, and not the rule,
                  among anti-slavery men. The great majority well comprehend that the greatest
                  results will follow efforts made without bitterness of temper. They remember that
                  whilst the Saviour<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6562-00000068"/> denounced without
                  stint the formal scribe, the hollow Pharisee, and the greedy money-changer, he
                  chose for his sphere of exertion the society of publicans and sinners.</p>
               <p>4. Anti-slavery men seek to set slaves against their masters, at the risk of the
                  lives and happiness of both.</p>
               <p>This impression, which is much the most common, is, at the same time, the least
                  founded in truth of all. No evidence, worthy of a moment's credit, has ever been
                  produced, implicating any class of them in a suspicion of the kind. Nothing proves
                  the absence of all malignity towards the slaveholders more clearly than this. If
                  they sought really to injure them, what could be more easy than to stimulate
                  disaffection along so extensive a line of boundary as that of the slave States?
                  Probably few of them entertain any doubt of the abstract <emph>right</emph> of the
                  slave to free himself from the condition in which he is kept against his own
                  consent, in any manner practicable. How easy then the step from this opinion to an
                  act of encouragement! That it has never been taken furnishes the most conclusive
                  proof of the falsity of the popular impression, and of the moderations of the
                  anti-slavery men, who seek only, in the moral convictions of the masters, for the
                  source of freedom to the slaves.</p>
               <p>But though it be true that all these common impressions are delusions strewn in
                  the way of anti-slavery men to impair the effect of their exertions, it by no
                  means follows that they should be induced by them to assume a moderation which
                  encourages sluggishness. No great movement in human affairs can be made without
                  zeal, energy, and perseverance. It must be animated by a strong will, and tempered
                  by a benevolent purpose. Such is the shape which the anti-slavery reform is
                  gradually assuming. Its motto, then, should be, as was said in the beginning: <q>

               <p>IT is a mistake on the part of the people of the south to suppose that those who
                  desire the extinction of slavery, whether residing in America or England, are
                  actuated by unfriendly feelings toward them personally, or by any hostility to the
                  pecuniary or social interests of their section of country. The most important and
                  influential classes of the population, both of England and of the northern States
                  of this Union, have a direct and strong pecuniary interest at stake, in the
                  prosperity and welfare of the south. If the people of Massachusetts or those of
                  Lancashire were employed in raising cotton and sugar, and if the prices which they
                  obtained for their produce were kept down by southern competition, then there
                  might perhaps be some ground for suspecting a covert hostility in any action or
                  influence which they might attempt to exert on such a question. But the contrary
                  is the fact. New England and Old England manufacture and consume the cotton and
                  sugar which the south produces. They are directly and deeply interested in having
                  the production of these articles go on in the most advantageous manner possible.
                  The southern planter is not their competitor and rival. He is their partner. His
                  work is to them and to their pursuits one of co-operation and aid. Consequently
                  his prosperity is their prosperity, and his ruin would be an irretrievable
                  disaster, not a benefit, to them. They are thus naturally his friends, and,
                  consequently, when in desiring a change in the relation which subsists between him
                  and his laborers, they declare that they are not actuated by any unfriendly
                  feeling toward him, but honestly think that the change would be beneficial to all
                  concerned, there is every reason why they should be believed.</p>
               <p>There was a time when the laboring population of England occupied a position in
                  respect to the proprietors of the soil there, very analogous to that now held by
                  African slaves in our country. But the system has been changed. From being serfs,
                  compelled to toil for masters, under the influence of compulsion or fear, they
                  have become a free peasantry, working<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6562-00000070"/>
                  in the employment of landlords, for wages. But this change has not depressed or
                  degraded the landlords, or injured them in any way. On the contrary, it has
                  probably elevated and improved the condition of the master quite as much as it has
                  that of the man.</p>
               <p>Imagine such a change as this on any southern plantation: the Christian master
                  desiring conscientiously to obey the divine command,—given expressly for his
                  guidance, in his responsible relation of employer,—that he should "give unto his
                  servants that which is just and equal,—forbearing threatening,"—resolves that he
                  will henceforth induce industry on his estate by the payment of honest wages,
                  instead of coercing his laborers by menaces and stripes; and after carefully
                  considering the whole ground, he estimates, as fairly and faithfully as he can,
                  what proportion of the whole avails of his culture properly belong to the labor
                  performed by his men, and what to the capital, skill, and supervision, furnished
                  and exercised by himself,—and then fixes upon a rate of wages, graduating the
                  scale fairly and honestly according to the strength, the diligence, and the
                  fidelity of the various laborers. Suppose, also, that some suitable arrangement is
                  made on the plantation or in the vicinity, by which the servants vants can expend
                  what they earn, in such comforts, ornaments, or luxuries as are adapted to their
                  condition and their ideas. Suppose that, in consequence of the operation of this
                  system, the laborers, instead of desiring, as now, to make their escape from the
                  scene of labor, should each prize and value his place in it, and fear dismission
                  from it as a punishment. Suppose that through the change which this new state of
                  things should produce, it should become an agreeable and honorable duty to
                  superintend and manage the system, as it is now agreeable and honorable to
                  superintend the operations of a manufactory, or the construction or working of a
                  railway, or the building of a fortress, or any other organized system in industry
                  where the workmen are paid, and that consequently, instead of rude and degraded
                  overseers, intemperate and profane, extorting labor by threats and severity, there
                  should be found a class of intelligent, humane, and honest men, to direct and
                  superintend the industry of the estate,—men whom the proprietor would not be
                  ashamed to associate with, or to admit to his parlor or table. In a word, suppose
                  that the general contentment and happiness which the new system would induce in
                  all concerned in it, were such that peace of<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000071"/> mind should return to the master's breast,
                  now,—especially in hours of sickness and suffering, and at the approach of
                  death,—so often disturbed, and a sense of safety be restored to his family, so
                  that it should no longer be necessary to keep the pistols or the rifle always at
                  hand, and that the wife and children could lie down and sleep at night, without
                  starting at unusual or sudden sounds, or apprehending insurrection when they hear
                  the cry of fire. Suppose that such a change as this were possible, is it the part
                  of a friend or an enemy to desire to have it effected?</p>
               <p>But all such suppositions as these, the southern man will perhaps say, are
                  visionary and Utopian in the highest degree. No such state of things as is
                  contemplated by them, can by any possibility be realized with such a population as
                  the southern slaves. Very well; say <emph>this,</emph> if you please, and prove
                  it, if it can be proved. But do not charge those who desire that it might be
                  realized, with being actuated, in advocating the change, by unfriendly feelings
                  towards you,—for most assuredly they do not entertain any.</p>

               <p>THE clock struck the appointed hour, and the sale commenced. Articles of household
                  furniture, horses, carts, and slaves, were waiting together to be sold to the
                  highest bidder. For strange as it would seem in another land than this, beneath
                  the ample folds of the "Star-spangled Banner," <emph>human sinews</emph> were to
                  be bought and sold. Bodies, such as the Apostle called the "temples of the Holy
                  Ghost," in which dwelt souls for which Christ died;—men, women and little
                  children, made in the image of God, were classed with marketable commodities, to
                  be sold by the pound, like dumb beasts in the shambles. Husbands would be torn
                  from their wives, mothers from their children, and <emph>all</emph> from
                  everything they loved most dearly.</p>

               <p>The group of <emph>human chattels</emph> excited great interest among the
                  lookers-on, for they were a choice lot of prime negroes, and rumor said that he

                  </q> as they waited with anxious looks and quivering hearts to hear their doom,
                  filling up the dreary moments with thoughts of the chances and changes which
                  overhung their future.</p>
               <p>A bright-eyed boy, of twelve years old, <q>
                     <l>"A brave, free-hearted, careless one,"</l>
                  </q> with a proud spirit playing in every line of his handsome face, and in every
                  movement of his graceful form, was first called to the auction-block. His good
                  qualities were rapidly enumerated, his limbs rudely examined, his soundness
                  vouched for, and he became the chattel personal of a Georgian, who boasted of his
                  good bargain; and on being warned that he would have trouble with the boy,
                  declared with an oath, that he would "soon take the devil out of him."</p>
               <p>Matty, a sister of this lad, was next placed upon the stand. Her beauty, which the
                  excitement of that dreadful moment only served to heighten, hushed for awhile the
                  coarse jests of the crowd. She was a splendid-looking creature, just entering upon
                  woman-hood. But her beauty proved, as beauty must ever prove to a slave woman, a
                  deadly curse. It enhanced her market value, and sealed her deadly fate. It
                  attracted the eye, and inflamed the passions of a wealthy Louisianian, named St.
                  Laurent, who gave a thousand dollars in hard gold in exchange for her, that he
                  might make her his petted favorite. Wives, mothers, daughters of America, have
                     <emph>you</emph> nothing to do with slavery, when such is the fate of slave
                  women? <emph>Can</emph> you sit silent, and at your ease, knowing that such things
                  are?</p>
               <p>When Matty was removed from the auction-block, she fell upon her brother's neck,
                  and wept such tears as only they can weep whom slavery parts, never to meet
                  again.</p>
               <p>"Christine!" cried the loud voice of the auctioneer. Matty checked her passionate
                  grief, and turning saw her mother, with her baby in her arms, standing where she
                  herself had stood but just before. Quickly her<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000073"/> keen eye sought the form of her new master. With a
                  sudden impulse she threw herself at his feet, exclaiming, "O master, master,
                     <emph>do</emph> buy my mother too!" The man gazed for a moment on the beautiful
                  face upturned to his, with a look which made the lashes droop over her pleading
                  eyes, and tapping her cheek with his finger, he said,</p>
               <p>"What! coaxing so early, my pretty one? No, no; it will not do; I have no use for
                  the old woman."</p>
               <p>"Oh, master, she is not old. <emph>Do</emph> buy my mother, master!"</p>
               <p>"Here is a prize for you, gentlemen," broke in the harsh tones of the auctioneer.
                  "There is the best housekeeper and cook in all Virginia. Who bids for her? $300
                  did you say, sir? $325—thanks, gentlemen, but I cannot sell this woman for a song.
                  She is an excellent seamstress. $400—$450—$500—I am glad to see you are warming up
                  a little, gentlemen,—but she is worth more money than that. Look at her! What a
                  form! what an eye! what arms!—there is muscle for you, gentlemen. Upon my honor
                  she is the flower of the lot,—a dark-colored rose,—black, but comely; and her baby
                  goes with her. $550, did I hear you say, sir? Will no one give more than $550 for
                  such a woman and baby?"</p>
               <p>"The baby is of no account," said Mr. St. Laurent; "she would sell better without
                  it. If I buy her, I shall give away the little encumbrance."</p>
               <p>The poor slave-mother heard him, and strained her baby to her bosom, as if she
                  would say, "You shall <emph>never</emph> take him from me." The boy looked into
                  her face, and smiled a sweet baby smile, and put his little arms about her neck,
                  and laid his cheek on hers. One would have thought he understood what was passing
                  in her heart, and strove to comfort her. "$575—$600—$650,"—and Christine and her
                  baby boy became the property of Mr. St. Laurent.</p>
               <p>"I would not have bought the woman," said he, turning to an acquaintance, "but for
                  the girl's importunity. I feared she would have the sulks if I didn't, and I want
                  to keep her good-natured. I shall give the mother as a wedding-present to my
                  daughter. But anybody may have the child, who will take him off my hands?"</p>
               <p>"I will take him, sir, and thank you too," said a little, sharp-looking, bustling
                  man, stepping briskly up, and bowing to Mr. St. Laurent.</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6562-00000074"/>
               <p>"Will you, my friend? Then he is yours, and you may take him away as soon as you
                  please."</p>
               <p>"If I take him now, the woman will raise a storm," said the little man; "I know a
                  better way than that," and drawing Mr. St. Laurent aside, he communicated his
                  plan, and they parted mutually satisfied.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the sale went on, but we will not follow further its revolting details.
                  Christine, with her baby and Matty, were put in safe quarters for the night.
                  Notwithstanding the intense anxiety that filled their minds, and a superstitious
                  fear in Christine's heart that the worst had not yet come, an unaccountable
                  drowsiness oppressed them, and before long both fell into a deep death-like
                  sleep.</p>
               <p>Morning broke over the green earth. The sun gilded the mountain-tops, and bathing
                  the trees in splendor, was greeted with ten thousand bird-songs. He kissed the
                  dewy flowers, and their fragrance rose as incense on the morning air. He looked
                  into the windows of happy homes, and wakened golden-haired children to renew their
                  joyous sports, and mothers, whose <q>

                  </q> sent up their morning thanksgiving to "Him who never slumbers," for His
                  protection of their "laughing dimpled treasures." Suddenly a warm ray fell upon
                  the face of the sleeping slave-mother. She wakened with a start, and with one will
                  shrick of agony sprang from the bed. Her babe was gone.</p>
               <p>Why need we dwell upon what followed? What open can describe the anguish of the
                  heart-broken mother, when she knew that while under the influence of opiates which
                  she had unwittingly taken, her boy had been taken from her, and that she should
                  look upon her darling's face no more. Mother! look at the darling nestler upon
                  your own bosom, and ask yourself how you would have felt in Christine's place.</p>
               <p>After the first burst of agony was over, she did not give way outwardly to grief.
                  One might have thought she did not grieve. But she carried all her sorrows in her
                  heart, till they had eaten out her life.</p>
               <p>On the morning of Eleanore St. Laurent's bridal day, Christine was sent for to
                  perform some service for her young mistress. But the spoil had been taken out of

               <head>The Intellectual, Moral, and Spiritual Condition of the Slave.</head>
               <p>THE American slave is a human being. He possesses all the attributes of mind and
                  heart that belong to the rest of mankind. He has intellect with which to think,
                  sensibility with which to feel, and toil which prompts him to vigorous and manly
                  action. Nor is he destitute of the sublime faculty of reason, which is related to
                  eternal and absolute truths. Imagination and fancy, too, he possesses, in a very
                  large degree. But all these faculties, which nature has bestowed upon the slave in
                  common with other men, by a decree of slavery fixed and unalterable like the laws
                  of the Medes and Persians, are undeveloped, and the results, therefore, of their
                  activities are not to be found. How mean then it must be to reproach the
                  unfortunate slave with a lack of intellectual qualities<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000076"/> ties, such as characterize men generally. In proof
                  of the statement, that slaves have these qualities, it is only necessary to refer
                  to the many fugitives who, by their great thoughts, their masterly logic, and
                  their captivating eloquence, are astonishing both the Old and the New World.
                  Education is what the white man needs for the development of his intellectual
                  energies. And it is what the black man needs for the development of his. Educate
                  him, and his mind proves itself at once as profound and masterly in its
                  conceptions, and as brisk and irresistible in its decisions, as the mind of any
                  other man.</p>
               <p>But, in addition to his intellectual, the slave possesses a moral nature, capable
                  of the highest development and the most refined culture. A conscience tender and
                  acute, the voice of God in his soul bidding him to choose the right and avoid the
                  wrong, is his lawful inheritance bestowed upon him by his Heavenly Father. This no
                  one can deny who knows aught of the love of moral truth manifested by the slaves
                  of this country. God has not left the slaves without moral sense. Nor has he
                  denied him the spiritual faculty which, when cultivated, enables him to recognize
                  God in his spiritual manifestations, to discern and appreciate spiritual truths,
                  and to feel and relish the gentle distillations of the spirit of divine love as
                  they fall upon his heart like dew upon the grateful earth. The moral and spiritual
                  nature of the slave, however, like his intellectual, goes uneducated and
                  untrained. Deep, dark, and impenetrable is the gloom which enshrouds the mind and
                  soul of the slave. No ray of light cheers him in his midnight darkness. No one is
                  allowed to fetch him the blessings of education, and no preacher of righteousness
                  is suffered to illumine his dark mind by the presentation of sacred truth.</p>
               <p>It is indeed true that slavery is a political, a civil, and a commercial evil. It
                  is true that it is most excruciating and frightful in its effects upon the
                  physical nature of its victim. But slavery is seen in its more awful wickedness
                  and terrible heinousness, when we contemplate the vast waste of intellect, the
                  vast waste of moral and spiritual energy, which has been caused by its poisonous
                  touch.</p>
               <p>And yet the power of the State, and the influence of the Church, are given to its
                  support. Many of our leading statesmen are engaged in devising and furthering
                  plans for the extension of its territorial area, thereby hoping to perpetuate and
                  eternize its<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6562-00000077"/> bloody existence, while
                  the majority of our most distinguished divines find employment in constructing
                  discourses, founded upon perverse expositions of sacred writ, calculated to
                  establish and fix in the minds of the people the impression that slavery is a
                  divine institution.</p>
               <p>Although this mighty power of the State, and influence of the Church, be opposed
                  to the slave, let him not despair, but be full of hope. For God is upon his side,
                  truth is upon his side, and a multitude of good and able men and women are engaged
                  in working out his redemption.</p>

               <head>The Bible vs. Slavery.</head>
               <p>"NOTHING," says Dr. Spring, "is more plain to my mind than that the word of God
                  recognizes the relation between master and slave as one of the established
                  institutions of the age; and, that while it addresses slaves as Christian men, and
                  Christian men as slaveholders, it so modifies the whole system of slavery as to
                  give a death-blow to all its abuses, and breathes such a spirit, that in the same
                  proportion in which its principles are imbibed, the yoke of bondage will melt
                  away, all its abuses cease, and every form of human oppression will be unknown.
                  The Bible is no agitator. It changes human governments only as it changes the
                  human character. It aims at transforming the dispositions and hearts of men, and
                  diffusing through all human institutions the supreme love of God, and the
                  impartial love of man."</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6562-00000078"/>
               <p>Now, this either means that the Bible requires that all institutions be adjusted
                  and harmonized with the moral law—the law of love—or it means nothing. For, we
                  maintain, that slavery is <foreign xml:lang="LAT">per se</foreign> wrong, where
                  the enslaver has no direct warrant from heaven, or the enslaved has not forfeited
                  liberty by crime on principles of recognized and universal equity; and the whole
                  Bible forbidding wrong must be held as forbidding slavery, or any arbitrary and
                  inhuman tamperings with the inalienable rights of a fellow-creature.</p>
               <p>If slavery is not a wrong in itself, irrespective of what are called its abuses,
                  then all that is essential in it may be retained from age to age; and all the
                  amelioration which the Christian law superinduces may be such as to consist with
                  the violation of the natural prerogatives of humanity, and with the denial to man
                  of the essential and dearest privileges of social and domestic life, with the
                  denial of the rights of conscience too. For slavery, as distinguished from service
                  by contract, is this thing and no other:—it is labor undefined, unrewarded, on the
                  condition of being used as vendible property, and every independent right of the
                  slave, as an intellectual and moral being, is ignored. By practical indulgence
                  such rights may be sometimes conceded. But the slave-law ceases as such when these
                  are recognized.</p>
               <p>Now, we hold it a libel on the Bible to affirm that it sanctions such slavery. We
                  must warn you of the fallacy that lies in this distinction of the thing itself,
                  and its abuse. What is called the abuse here is the essence and the characteristic
                  of the subject. Service as well as slavery may be abused. Everything may be
                  abused. But, the claim of the slaveholder is itself the abuse of the God-ordained
                  relation of master and servant. Can men be regarded as a chattel?—that is the
                  question—and so regarded without his consent, and his family treated as such
                  permanently, without his consent, or even with it?</p>
               <p>It comes of this bad interpretation of the Christian law, that in the nineteenth
                  century slavery still remains,—is cherished. It is not that the principles of
                  Christianity do not tend to extinguish it. But men, forcing their false
                  interpretation on the Scriptures, plead their authority for a system or
                  institution, to which their whole spirit is opposed,—and which confesses its
                  unscriptural character by keeping out Christian light, and forbidding the
                  Scriptures with the slave.</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6562-00000079"/>
               <p>To talk of the spirit of Christianity, in distinction from its express or implied
                  law against slavery, is as if one would trust for the extinction of sin against
                  the sixth or seventh commands of the decalogue, by general inculcation of meekness
                  or purity, without denouncing murder and defining it, or defining between allowed
                  and disallowed affinity in the marriage law. We may if we do not proscribe theft,
                  and bring the positive law of God to bear against it, and bring a law into harmony
                  with the divine, be understood, while we talk only of the abuses of property, as
                  warning rather against spending stolen goods in a bad way, than against theft
                  itself? But the design of the moral law is to define rights, as well as to govern
                  the use of them; and it requires that not only the tempers of men, but the
                  institutions of society, be adjusted by the law of equity and charity. It forbids
                  not only the abuse of just power, but all false usurpations of power, and classes
                  man-stealers and extortioners as murderers.</p>
               <p>Who, if he but examines the laws of social and relative duty, as laid down in the
                  New Testament Epistles, may not discern that the relation of master and servant is
                  recognized side by side with the permanent relations of parent and child, husband
                  and wife, which rest on the law of nature; just because it is not the temporary,
                  unnatural, and violent relation of slaveholder and slave which is recognized, but
                  that of master and servant by contract. The other, its very apologists allow, will
                  pass away; but these duties are enhanced in a law of permanent application, and
                  rest on natural principles, common to all times and all nations.</p>

               <p>LIKE all Reforms which have for their object the amelioration of man's condition;
                  the advancement of the Redeemer's kingdom; the cause of human freedom has
                  encountered many oppositions calculated to impede its progress. It has temporarily
                  suffered from cruel defection within, and the most virulent persecution without
                  the camp.</p>
               <p>John, the forerunner of Jesus, had for his portion "locusts and wild honey." But
                  those who have stood forth in the sunlight, the advocates of the crushed and
                  bleeding bondman; whose motto is, "Our country is the world, and our countrymen
                  all mankind," have had no <emph>honey</emph> for <emph>their</emph> portion. Oh
                  no! they have ever dwelt among the tempest and the storm, with thunder, lightning,
                  and whirlwind, to feed upon.</p>
               <p>Some have been called, for the advocacy of the truth, to wing their flight from
                  the prison-house to Heaven; and others, to bare their bosoms to the red-hot
                  indignation of relentless mobs, arrayed in murderous panoply. They have gone; but,
                  thank God, "THE WORK GOES BRAVELY ON!"</p>
               <p>The great men of the nation, the mighty men, the chief priests and rulers, have
                  risen in their strength, and resolved to crush, as with an avalanche, the
                  irrepressible aspirations of the bondman's heart for FREEDOM; they have attempted
                  to padlock the out-gushing sympathies of humanity; to trample in the dust the
                  sacred guarantees of the palladium of their own liberties, but their "terribleness
                  hath deceived them, and the pride of their heart," for the desolating angel hath
                  sealed <emph>their</emph> lips in the silence of the tomb, and we, the recipients
                  of their crushing cruelties, thank God "THE WORK GOES BRAVELY ON."</p>

                  against God, and treason against civil society. To teach otherwise, would be to

               <p>MY Dear Madam, your letter of September 23d I have received. I regret exceedingly
                  that it is not in my power to furnish the article you have done me the honor to
                  solicit, for the "Autographs for Freedom." Particularly do I regret this now, when
                  the great conflict between aristocracy and democracy is about being renewed all
                  over the continent of Europe, and when despots are pointing with exultation to the
                  unparalleled enormities of our "peculiar institutions," and the friends of
                  republican equality, in all lands, are disheartened by our example. Would the
                  slaveholders of the south but consent to place those who till their lands, under
                  the protection of wholesome and impartial law, and pay them honest<pb n="162"

                  the silent influence of a glorious example, to revolutionize all despotisms. We
                  have a vast continent to subdue and to adorn, and we need the aid of millions more
                  of willing hands to accomplish the magnificent enterprise. With much esteem I am

               <head>Disfellowshipping Slaveholders.</head>
               <p>THE late Dr. Chalmers, not long before his death, spoke with disapprobation of
                  Abolitionists in the United States, "for undertaking," as he said, "to decide,
                  without sufficient evidence, upon the irreligious character of ministers and
                  church-members. <emph>They,</emph> forsooth, undertake to exclude men from the
                  Lord's table, who are in good and regular standing in the church of Christ,
                  because they happen to hold slaves! <emph>They</emph> pretend to decide who, and
                  who are not Christians!" It is marvellous that so learned and so distinguished a
                  man should have fallen into such a mistake; and, on hearsay, ventured to utter a
                  most calumnious accusation against the friends of the slave.</p>
               <p>The Abolitionists might, perhaps, make decisions in the case not wide of the mark,
                  founded upon the rule given by Jesus Christ: "By their fruits ye shall know<pb
                     n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6562-00000085"/> them." But, in declaring that
                  slaveholders ought not to be fellowshipped as Christians, they do not say whether
                  a slaveholder is or is not a Christian. On the contrary, they leave each one with
                  his Maker, the INFALLIBLE JUDGE. But this they do:—they hold that no slaveholder,
                  professing to be a Christian, is entitled to Christian FELLOWSHIP,
                     <emph>because</emph> slaveholding is a sin, and should subject the offender to
                  discipline. Neither Dr. Chalmers nor any other divine could deny the propriety of
                  this, provided they believed that slaveholding is a sin, or an ecclesiastical
                  offence. The apostle Paul directed that Christians should not <emph>eat</emph>
                  with an <emph>extortioner.</emph> A slaveholder is an extortioner. If, then, a
                  Christian may not eat a common meal with such an offender, may he sit at the
                  Lord's table with him? I trow not.</p>

                  one rushing down some fearful steep, bidding you follow; now on some delightful
                  stream, still beckoning you onward.</p>
               <p>In either case, no matter what your prepossessions or oppositions, you for the
                  moment, at least, forget the justness or unjustness of his cause and obey the
                  summons, and loath, if at all, you return to your former post.</p>
               <p>Not always, however, is he successful in retaining you. Giddy as you may be with
                  the descent you have made, delighted as you are with the pleasure afforded, with
                  the elysium to which he has wafted you, you return too often dissatisfied with his
                  and your own impetuosity and want of firmness. You feel that you had had only a
                  dream, a pastime, not a reality.</p>
               <p>This great power of momentary captivation consists in his eloquence of manner—his
                  just appreciation of words.</p>
               <p>In listening to him, your whole soul is fired—every nerve strung—every passion
                  inflated—every faculty you possess ready to perform at a moment's bidding. You
                  stop not to ask why or wherefore.</p>
               <p>Tis a unison of mighty yet harmonious sounds that play upon your imagination; and
                  you give yourself up, for a time, to their irresistible charm.</p>
               <p>At last, the <emph>cataract</emph> which roared around you is hushed, the
                     <emph>tornado</emph> is passed, and you find yourself sitting upon a bank (at
                  whose base roll but tranquil waters), quietly meditating that why, amid such a
                  display of power, no greater effect had really been produced.</p>
               <p>After all, it must be admitted, there is a power in Mr. Douglass rarely to be
                  found in any other man.</p>
               <p>With copiousness of language, and finish of diction, when even ideas fail, words
                  come to his aid—arranging themselves, as it were, so completely, that they not
                  only captivate, but often deceives us for ideas; and hence the vacuum that would
                  necessarily occur in the address of an ordinary <emph>speaker</emph> is filled up,
                  presenting the same beautiful harmony as do the lights and shades of a
                  picture.</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6562-00000087"/>
               <p>From Mr. Douglass, in this, perhaps, as much as in any other respect, does Mr.
                     <emph>Ward</emph> differ. Ideas form the basis of all Mr. Ward utters. Words
                  are only used to express those ideas.</p>
               <p>If words and ideas are not inseparable, then, as mortar is to the stones that
                  compose the building, so are his words to his ideas.</p>
               <p>In this, I judge, lays Mr. Ward's greatest strength. Concise without
                  abruptness—without extraordinary stress, always clear and forcible; if sparing of
                  ornament, never inelegant. In all, there appears a consciousness of strength,
                  developed by close study and deep reflection, and only put forth because the
                  occasion demanded,—a power not only to examine but to enable you to see the
                  fairness of that examination and the justness of its conclusions.</p>
               <p>You feel Douglass to be right, without always seeing it; perhaps it is not too
                  much to say, when Ward is right you see it.</p>
               <p>His appeals are directed rather to the understanding than the imagination; but so
                  forcibly do they take possession of it, that the heart unhesitatingly yields.</p>
               <p>If, as we have said, Mr. Douglass seems as one whirling down some steep descent
                  whose very impetuosity impels;—ere you are aware of it, it is the quiet serenity
                  of Mr. Ward, as he points up the rugged ascent, and invites you to follow, that
                  inspires your confidence and ensures your safety. Step by step do you with him
                  climb the rugged steep; and, as you gain each succeeding eminence, he points you
                  to new scenes and new delights;—now grand—sublime; now picturesque and
                  beautiful;—always real. Most speakers fail to draw a perfect figure. This point I
                  think Mr. Ward has gained. His figures, when done, stand out with prominence,
                  possessing both strength and elegance.</p>
               <p>Douglass' imagery is fine—vivid—often gaudily painted. Ward's pictures—bold,
                  strong, glowing.</p>
               <p>Douglass speaks right on; you acknowledge him to have been on the ground—nay, to
                  have gone over the field; <emph>Ward</emph> seeks for and finds the corners;
                  sticks the stakes, and leaves them standing; we know where to find them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Douglass deals in generals; Mr. Ward reduces everything to a point.</p>
               <p>Douglass is the <emph>lecturer;</emph> Ward the <emph>debater.</emph> Douglass
                  powerful in invective; Ward in argument. What<pb n="170-171"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000088"/> advantage Douglass gains in mimicry Ward recovers
                  in wit.</p>
               <p>Douglass has sarcasm, Ward point.</p>
               <p>Here, again, an essential difference may be pointed out:—</p>
               <p>Douglass says much, at times, you regret he uttered. This, however, is the real
                  man, and on reflection you like him the better for it. What Ward says you feel to
                  be but a necessity, growing out of the case,—that it ought to have been said—that
                  you would have said precisely the same yourself, without adding or diminishing a
                  single sentence.</p>
               <p>Douglass, in manner, is at all times pleasing; Ward seldom less so; often raises
                  to the truly majestic, and never descends below propriety. If you regret when
                  Douglass ceases to speak, you are anxious Ward should continue.</p>
               <p>Dignity is an essential quality in an orator—I mean true dignity.</p>
               <p>Douglass has this in an eminent degree; Ward no less so, coupled with it great
                  self-possession. He is never disconcerted—all he desires he says.</p>
               <p>In one of his replies to Mr. Douglass I was struck with admiration, and even
                  delight, at the calm, dignified fied manner in which he expressed himself, and his
                  ultimate triumph under what seemed to me very peculiar circumstances.</p>
               <p>Douglass' was a splendid effort—a beautiful effusion. One of those outpourings
                  from the deeps of his heart of which he can so admirably give existence to.</p>
               <p>He had brought down thunders of well-merited applause; and sure I am, that a
                  whisper, a breath from almost any other opponent than Mr. Ward, would have
                  produced a tumult of hisses.</p>
               <p>Not so, however, now. The quiet, majestic air, the suppressed richness of a
                  deep-toned, but well-cultivated voice, as the speaker paid a few well-timed
                  compliments to his opponents, disturbed not, as it had produced, the dead
                  stillness around.</p>
               <p>Next followed some fine sallies of wit, which broke in on the calm.</p>
               <p>He then proceeded to make and accomplished one of the most finished speeches to
                  which I have ever listened, and sat down amidst a perfect storm of cheers.</p>
               <p>It was a noble burst of eloquence,—the gatherings up of the choicest possible
                  culled thoughts, and poured forth, mingling with a unison of brilliant flashes
                     and<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6562-00000089"/> masterly strokes, following each
                  other in quick succession; and though felt—deeply felt, no more to be described
                  than the vivid lightning's zig-zag, as produced from the deep-charged
                  thunder-cloud.</p>
               <p>If Douglass is not always successful in his attempts to heave up his ponderous
                  missiles at his opponents, from the point of his descent, he always shows
                  determination and spirit.</p>
               <p>He is often too far down the <emph>pass,</emph> however, (herculean though he be,)
                  for his intent.</p>
               <p>Ward, from the eminence he has gained, giant-like, hurls them back with the force
                  and skill of a practised marksman, almost invariably to the detriment of his
                  already fallen victim.</p>
               <p>In Douglass you have a man, in whose soul the iron of oppression has far entered,
                  and you feel it.</p>
               <p>He tells the story of his wrongs, so that they stand out in all their naked
                  ugliness.</p>
               <p>In Ward, you have one with strong native powers,—I know of none stronger;
                  superadded a careful and extensive cultivation; an understanding so matured, that
                  fully enables him to successfully grapple with men or errors, and portray truth in
                  a manner equalled by few.</p>
               <p>After all, it must be admitted, both are men of extraordinary powers of mind.</p>
               <p>Both well qualified for the task they have undertaken.</p>
               <p>I have, rather than anything else, drawn these outline portraits for our
                     <emph>young men,</emph> who can fill them up at leisure.</p>
               <p>The subjects are both fine models, and may be studied with profit by
                  all,—especially those who are destined to stand in the front rank.<ref

               <head>The True Mission of Liberty.</head>
               <p>IF Liberty were to go on a pilgrimage all over the earth, she would find a home in
                  every house, and a welcome in every heart. None would reject the favors she offers
                  if brought to their own doors. Sure and prompt as the impulses of instinct, every
                  bosom would open to admit her and her blessings, but—when her gospel is proclaimed
                  as a common bounty to all the world,—when she is seen visiting and feasting with
                  publicans and sinners, and sitting with her unwashed disciples in familiar and
                  loving companionship, Cæsar and the synagogue are alike alarmed and enraged. When
                  she is found daily in the marketplace and on the mountain-top, in the hamlet and
                  on the highway, ministering to the multitude, healing and feeding them,—showing
                  the same love and reverence for humanity in every variety of conditions, and
                  however disguised or degraded,—the cruelty of caste and the bitterness of bigotry
                  straightway take counsel among themselves how they may destroy her.</p>
               <p>Heaven help us! Divided as we are, into the hating and the hated, the oppressors
                  and the oppressed, we have settled it, somehow, that we are of necessity at war
                  with each other—that the welfare of one in some way depends upon the wretchedness
                  of another. How much madness and misery would be spared if we could in any way
                  learn that we are brethren.</p>

               <head>The True Spirit of Reform.</head>
               <p>THE religion of Jesus, acting as a vital principle in the individual heart, and
                  thus leaving the entire mass of humanity, to this alone are we to look as of
                  sufficient power to do away the evils that are now rife in the world. Just so far
                  as the true spirit of Jesus is infused into the soul, and acts in the life of man,
                  we know that sin, in its various forms of sensuality, oppression, and bloodshed,
                  must disappear. All reforms, which are not based on this corner-stone, are
                  superficial; and, however goodly their proportions may appear to the eye of man,
                  they want that firm foundation which will secure them against being undermined or
                  overthrown by the force of adverse circumstances. "Other foundation can no man
                  lay, than that is laid," for the building up of all that is really excellent and
                  heavenly.</p>
               <p>But, while we acknowledge the omnipotence of true religion for the ratification of
                  all social wrongs, we are not to rest in the inculcation of its abstract
                  principles and outward forms alone. It is not enough that we ourselves become, or
                  persuade our fellow-men to become professed disciples of Jesus; not enough that,
                  in a general way, we urge the precepts of the gospel. The obtuseness of the human
                  heart, when hardened by habit and early education, requires that we make
                  particular application of the precepts of Christ, and address our efforts to the
                  removal of specific sins: the sins of our own age and country. It may be that our
                  brother, sincerely intending to act in the spirit of Jesus, is yet blinded by the
                  force of habit, and fails to see the sin in which he is living. If our position
                  make us to see more clearly than he the course he should pursue, let us endeavor
                  gently to remove the veil from his eyes, remembering how often our own vision is
                  dimmed by prejudice and outward circumstances. In the moral, as well as in the
                  natural world, we believe that God demands our active cooperation; and, as the
                  farmer not only sows the seed, but roots out the weeds from among the grain, so
                  are we to endeavor to eradicate from the broad field of the moral<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000094"/> world those evil practices which obstruct the
                  growth of the harvest of pure and undefiled religion.</p>
               <p>"The husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long
                  patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain." So are we obliged
                  often to have "long patience," until we see the manifest blessing of God on our
                  labors. But patient waiting becomes a virtue, only when combined with the exercise
                  of our best powers in promoting the object of our desire. We must adapt our
                  efforts to the express object which we seek to attain. Taking those spiritual
                  weapons which are "mighty for the pulling down of the strongholds" of sin, let us
                  assault the great evils of slavery and oppression of every name and kind, always
                  marching under the banners of the Prince of Peace, whose conquests are achieved
                  not by violence, but by the subduing power of God like love. Let us go forth,
                  brethren, sisters, a feeble band though we may seem to the eye of man, yet strong
                  in the assurance that the hosts of heaven are encamped round about us, and that
                  "more are they that are with us, than they that are" on the side of the oppressor;
                  and let us not falter until in God's own good time the word shall be spoken, not
                  as, we would hope, in the whirlwind or the earthquake, but in the "still small
                  voice" of the oppressor's own conviction, saying to the slaves, "Go free!"</p>

               <head>What has Canada to do with Slavery?</head>
               <p>THE question is often asked, both in Canada and in the United States: What have we
                  in Canada to do with the Institution of Slavery, as it exists in the neighboring
                  Republic? I do not think that a better answer is necessary, than that which is
                  contained in the following extracts—the former of which is taken from a speech
                  delivered by George Thompson, Esq., at the formation of the Anti-Slavery Society
                  of Canada—the latter from the valuable work of the Rev. Albert Barnes on
                  Slavery:</p>
               <p>"Are we separated geographically and politically from the country where slavery
                  reigns? We are, for that very reason, the persons best able to form an unbiassed
                  and sound judgment on the question at issue. We have as much to do with this
                  question as with any question that concerns the happiness of man, the<pb
                     n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6562-00000097"/> glory of God, or the hopes and
                  destinies of the human race. We have to do with this question, for it lies at the
                  foundation of our own rights as a portion of the human family. The cause of
                  liberty is one all over the world. What have you to do with this question? The
                  slave is your brother, and you cannot dissolve that Union. While he remains God's
                  child he will remain your brother. He is helpless, and you are free and powerful;
                  and if you neglect him, you are not doing as you would have others do to you, were
                  you in bonds. Know you not that it is God's method to save man by man, and that
                  man is only great, and honorable, and blest himself, as he is the friend and
                  defender of those who need his aid. You are dwellers on the same continent with
                  three millions of slaves. Their sighs come to you with every breeze from the
                  South. Oh, haste to help them, that this glorious continent may be freed from its
                  pollution and its curse."</p>
               <p>Extract from Barnes on slavery:</p>
               <p>"Slavery pertains to a great wrong done to our common nature, and affects great
                  questions, relating to the final triumph of the principles of justice and
                  humanity. The race is one great brotherhood, and every man is under obligation, as
                  far as he has the ability, to defend those principles which will permanently
                  promote the welfare of the human family. * * * * The questions of right and wrong
                  know no geographical limits; are bounded by no conventional lines; are
                  circumscribed by the windings of no river or stream, and are not designated by
                  climate or by the course of the sun. There are no enclosures within which the
                  question of right and wrong may not be carried with the utmost freedom."</p>

               <head>The Fugitive Slave Bill: a Fragment.</head>
               <p>BUT ours is the saddest part of this sad business. It would be hard enough to live
                  surrounded by bondmen, even though we had never known any other way of life.
                  Still, for one who had grown up with young slaves for playmates and for nurses,
                  there might be much in the relation to quiet the conscience and soothe the
                  sensibilities. Strong attachments, we all know, are often realized, even in a
                  condition of things so anomalous. Perhaps, too, a large number of those about us
                  would be as feeble in capacity as humble in their circumstances. One so born might
                  tolerate such a position. But how different,—how, in comparison, and in every way
                  intolerable, to be set as watchmen and interceptors of these, the brighter and the
                  better, who, beyond all controversy, have outgrown the estate of bondage, and who
                  are so loudly called of God to be freemen, that they will brave any peril in
                  obedience to the call! How can we do this and still be men and Christians? Would
                  our brethren at the south do it for us? If we have, in our haste, so covenanted,
                  must we not rather pay the penalty than fulfil the bond? I recognize obedience to
                  civil government as the solemn duty of all save <emph>those who without cause are
                     made outlaws by the State.</emph> Government protects our hearths and shelters
                  those who are dearest to us. But we can honor the law by submitting to its
                  penalties as well as by complying with its demands, and the penalty would be my
                  election when a man who had seized his manhood at the peril of his life should
                  claim of me shelter and the means of escape. Before I refuse that, "may my right
                  hand forget its cunning and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth."</p>

               <p>SUCH is the unholy and gigantic power that, leaving its territorial domain, has

               <head>The Dishonor of Labor.</head>
               <p>THE fundamental, essential cause of slavery and its concomitants, ignorance,
                  degradation and suffering on the one side, as of idleness, prodigality and
                  luxury-born disease on the other is a false idea of the nature and officers of
                  Labor.</p>
               <p>Labor is not truly a curse, as has too long been asserted. It only becomes such
                  through human perverseness, misconception and sin. It was no curse to the first
                  pair in Eden, and will not be to their descendants, whenever and wherever the
                  spirit of Eden shall pervade them. It is only a curse because too many seek to
                  engross the product of others' work, yet do little or none themselves. If the
                  secret were but out, <emph>than no man can really enjoy more than his own moderate
                     daily labor would produce, and none can truly enjoy this without doing the

                  cunning and strong will be able to prey upon the simple and feeble, whether the
                  latter be called slaves or something else.</p>
               <p>The great reform required is not a work of hours nor of days, but of many years.
                  It must first pervade our literature, and thence our current ideas and

                  or infirm to work, but because he has become rich enough to live without work;</p>
               <p>Every man who educates his son for a profession, rather than a mechanical or
                  agricultural calling, not because of that son's supposed fitness for the former
                  rather than the latter, but because he imagines Law, Physic or Preaching, a more
                  respectable, genteel vocation, than building houses or growing grain;</p>
               <p>Every maiden who prefers in marriage a rich suitor of doubtful morals or scanty

               <head>The Evils of Colonization.</head>
               <p>I SPEAK the words of soberness and truth when I say, that the most inveterate, the
                  most formidable, the deadliest enemy of the peace, prosperity, and happiness of
                  the colored population of the United States, is that system of African
                  colonization which originated in and is perpetuated by a worldly, Pharoah-like
                  policy beneath the dignity of a magnanimous and Christian people;—a system which
                  receives much of its vitality from <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ad captandum</foreign>
                  appeals to popular prejudices, and to the unholy, grovelling passions of the
                  canaille;—a system that interposes every possible obstacle in the way of the
                  improvement and elevation of the colored man in the land of his birth;—that
                  instigates the enactment of laws whose design and tendency are obviously to annoy
                  him, to make him feel, while at home, that he is a stranger and a pilgrim—nay
                  more,—to make him "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked;"—to
                  make him "a hissing and a by-word," "a fugitive and a vagabond" throughout the
                  American Union;—a system that is so irreconcilably opposed to the purpose of God
                  in making "of <emph>one</emph> blood all nations for to dwell on <emph>all</emph>
                  the face of the earth," that when the dying slaveholder, under the lashes of a
                  guilty conscience, would give to his slaves unqualified freedom, it wickedly
                  interposes, and persuades him that "to do justly and love mercy" would be to
                  inflict an irreparable injury upon the community, and that to do his duty to God
                  and his fellow-creatures, under the circumstances, he should bequeath to his
                  surviving slaves the cruel alternative of <emph>either expatriation to a far-off,
                     pestilential clime, with the prospect of a premature death, or perpetual
                     slavery, with its untold horrors, in his native land.</emph> Against this most
                  iniquitous system of persecution and proscription of an inoffensive people, for no
                  other reason than that we wear the physical exterior given us in infinite wisdom
                  and benevolence, I would record, nay <emph>engrave</emph> with the pen of a
                  diamond, my most emphatic and solemn protest; more especially would I do so, as
                  the system, under<pb n="200" xml:id="VAC6562-00000104"/> animadversion, is most
                  inconsistently fostered, and shamelessly lauded, by ministers of the gospel in the
                  nineteenth century, as a scheme of Christian philanthropy! "O my soul, come not
                  thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united."</p>

               <head>The Basis of the American Constitution.</head>
               <p>"HAPPY," (said Washington, when announcing the treaty of peace to the army,)
                  "thrice happy shall they be pronounced hereafter, who shall have contributed
                  anything, who shall have performed the meanest office in erecting this stupendous
                  fabric of freedom and empire on the broad basis of independency, who shall have
                  assisted in protecting the Rights of Human Nature, and establishing an asylum for
                  the poor and oppressed of all nations and religions."</p>
               <p>You remember well that the Revolutionary Congress in the declaration of
                  independence placed the momentous controversy between the Colonies and Great
                  Britain on the absolute and inherent equality of all men. It is not, however, so
                  well understood that that body closed its existence on the adoption of the Federal
                  Constitution with this solemn injunction,<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6562-00000106"
                  /> addressed to the people of the United States: "Let it be remembered that it has
                  ever been the pride and boast of America, that the Rights for which she contended
                  were the Rights of Human Nature."</p>
               <p>No one will contend that our Fathers, after effecting the Revolution and the
                  independence of their country, by proclaiming this system of beneficent political
                  philosophy, established an entirely different one in the constitution assigned to
                  its government. This philosophy, then, is the basis of the American
                  Constitution.</p>
               <p>It is, moreover, a true philosophy, deduced from the nature of man and the
                  character of the Creator. If there were no supreme law, then the world would be a
                  scene of universal anarchy, resulting from the eternal conflict of peculiar
                  institutions and antagonistic laws. There being such a universal law, if any human
                  constitution and laws differing from it could have any authority, then that
                  universal law could not be supreme. That supreme law is necessarily based on the
                  equality of nations, of races, and of men. It is a simple, self-evident basis. One
                  nation, race, or individual, may not oppress or injure another, because the safety
                  and welfare of each is essential to the common safety and welfare of all. If all
                  are not equal and free, then who is entitled to be free, and what evidence of his
                  superiority can he bring from nature or revelation? All men necessarily have a
                  common interest in the promulgation and maintenance of these principles, because
                  it is equally in the nature of men to be content with the enjoyment of their just
                  rights, and to be-discontented under the privation of them. Just so far as these
                  principles practically prevail, the stringency of government is safely relaxed,
                  and peace and harmony obtain. But men cannot maintain these principles, or even
                  comprehend them, without a very considerable advance in knowledge and virtue. The
                  law of nations, designed to preserve peace among mankind, was unknown to the
                  ancients. It has been perfected in our own times, by means of the more general
                  dissemination of knowledge and practice of the virtues inculcated by Christianity.
                  To disseminate knowledge, and to increase virtue therefore among men, is to
                  establish and maintain the principles on which the recovery and preservation of
                  their inherent natural rights depend; and the State that does this most
                  faithfully, advances most effectually the common cause of Human Nature.</p>
               <p>For myself, I am sure that this cause is not a<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000107"/> dream, but a reality. Have not all men
                  consciousness of a property in the memory of human transactions available for the
                  same great purposes, the security of their individual rights, and the perfection
                  of their individual happiness? Have not all men a consciousness of the same equal
                  interest in the achievements of invention, in the instructions of philosophy, and
                  in the solaces of music and the arts? And do not these achievements, instructions,
                  and solaces, exert everywhere the same influences, and produce the same emotions
                  in the bosoms of all men? Since all languages are convertible into each other, by
                  correspondence with the same agents, objects, actions, and emotions, have not all
                  men practically one common language? Since the constitutions and laws of all
                  societies are only so many various definitions of the rights and duties of men as
                  those rights and duties are learned from Nature and Revelation, have not all men
                  practically one code of moral duty? Since the religions of men, in their various
                  climes, are only so many different forms of their devotion towards a Supreme and
                  Almighty Power entitled to their reverence and receiving it under the various
                  names of Jehovah, Jove, and Lord, have not all men practically one religion? Since
                  all men are seeking liberty and happiness for a season here, and to deserve and so
                  to secure more perfect liberty and happiness somewhere in a future world, and,
                  since they all substantially agree that these temporal and spiritual objects are
                  to be attained only through the knowledge of truth and the practice of virtue,
                  have not mankind practically one common pursuit through one common way of one
                  common and equal hope and destiny?</p>
               <p>If there had been no such common Humanity as I have insisted upon, then the
                  American people would not have enjoyed the sympathies of mankind when establishing
                  institutions of civil and religious liberty here, nor would their establishment
                  here have awakened in the nations of Europe and of South America desires and hopes
                  of similar institutions there. If there had been no such common Humanity, then we
                  should not ever, since the American Revolution, have seen human society throughout
                  the world divided into two parties, the high and the low—the one perpetually
                  foreboding and earnestly hoping the downfall, and the other as confidently
                  predicting and as sincerely desiring, the durability of Republican Institutions.
                  If there had been no such common<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6562-00000108"/>
                  Humanity, then we should not have seen this tide of emigration from insular and
                  continental Europe flowing into our country through the channels of the St.
                  Lawrence, the Hudson, and the Mississippi,—ebbing, however, always with the
                  occasional rise of the hopes of freedom abroad, and always swelling again into
                  greater volume when those premature hopes subside. If there were no such common
                  Humanity, then the poor of Great Britain would not be perpetually appealing to us
                  against the oppression of landlords on their farms and work-masters in their
                  manufactories and mines; and so, on the other hand, we should not be, as we are
                  now, perpetually framing apologies to mankind for the continuance of African
                  slavery among ourselves. If there were no such common Humanity, then the fame of
                  Wallace would have long ago died away in his native mountains, and the name even
                  of Washington would at most have been only a household word in Virginia, and not
                  as it is now, a watchword of Hope and Progress throughout the world.</p>
               <p>If there had been no such common Humanity, then when the civilization of Greece
                  and Rome had been consumed by the fires of human passion, the nations of modern
                  Europe could never have gathered from among its ashes the philosophy, the arts,
                  and the religion, which were imperishable, and have reconstructed with those
                  materials that better civilization, which, amid the conflicts and fall of
                  political and ecclesiastical systems, has been constantly advancing towards
                  perfection in every succeeding age. If there had been no such common Humanity,
                  then the dark and massive Egyptian obelisk would not have everywhere reappeared in
                  the sepulchral architecture of our own times, and the light and graceful orders of
                  Greece and Italy would not as now have been the models of our villas and our
                  dwellings, nor would the simple and lofty arch and the delicate tracery of Gothic
                  design have been as it now is, everywhere consecrated to the service of
                  religion.</p>
               <p>If there had been no such common humanity, then would the sense of the obligation
                  of the Decalogue have been confined to the despised nation who received it from
                  Mount Sinai, and the prophecies of Jewish seers and the songs of Jewish bards
                  would have perished forever with their temple, and never afterwards could they
                  have become as they now are, the universal utterance of the spiritual emotions
                     and<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6562-00000109"/> hopes of mankind. If there had
                  been no such common humanity, then certainly Europe and Africa, and even new
                  America, would not, after the lapse of centuries, have recognized a common
                  Redeemer, from all the sufferings and perils of human life, in a culprit who had
                  been ignominiously executed in the obscure Roman province of Judea; nor would
                  Europe have ever gone up in arms to Palestine, to wrest from the unbelieving Turk
                  the tomb where that culprit had slept for only three days and nights after his
                  descent from the cross,—much less would his traditionary instructions, preserved
                  by fishermen and publicans, have become the chief agency in the renovation of
                  human society, through after-coming ages.</p>

                  reads—</p>
               <p>"The performance of Uncle Tom's Cabin attracts to the theatre very unusual
                  audiences. In the "genteel row" last evening, we observed the strictest
                  religionists of the day, not excepting puritanic Presbyterians, and the sober
                  disciples of Wesley and Fox. For ourselves, we must candidly confess we have never
                  witnessed such a <emph>play</emph> upon all the emotions of which humanity is
                  susceptible. Mrs. Stowe, however unworthy the name of Patriot, is at least
                  entitled to the credit of seizing the great thought of the age, and embodying it
                  in such a form as to make it presentable to every order of mind and every class of
                  society. She says, in effect, to Legislators, let me furnish your amusements, and
                  I care not who makes your laws."</p>
               <p>Politicians would do well to look to this—<hi rend="i"/>(laying down the paper and
                  speaking in a tone of impatience)—so, so, Fanaticism is leading to its legitimate

                  <hi rend="i"/>Mr. F. (Not noticing Mr. D.'s remark.) One would think this last
                  appropriation of the vaunted hero would be sufficient to convince the most radical
                  of the demoralizing influence of these publications.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Frank. (Modestly.) How differently people judge. Why, last evening,
                  when I saw crowds of the hardened and dissipated shedding tears of honest
                  sympathy, when Uncle Tom and Eva sang, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"I see a band of spirits bright,</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q> I felt that the moral sentiment was asserting its supremacy even in places of

                  Oppression, but finding that it required her to take constant thought "what we
                  should eat and drink, and wherewithal we should be clothed," she was fain to relax

                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. G. I cannot think of any book which can be said to be written
                  for Slavery, in the sense that Uncle Tom's Cabin is written against it. Such a
                  work is, I think, impossible. No poet would attempt to portray its moral aspects,
                  and delineate its beauties, with the idea of exciting our admiration and
                  approval.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mr. F. Spoken just like a woman! Your sex always seize upon some

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. G. Softly, softly Frank, theatres and Slavery will be quite

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mr. F. Nothing can be easier—you have asserted in round terms that
                  no work was ever written in favor of Slavery. What an absurdity! If you have any

                  this topic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. G. Still if thee examine the matter, thee will<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000113"/> find that every one of these books treats Slavery
                  as a curse, and describes it not as a <emph>good</emph> but an <emph>evil,</emph>
                  of which each man loads the guilt upon his forefathers or his neighbors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mr. F. Granted they call it a curse, but assuredly they bring
                  forward a defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. G. Yes, they defend the Constitution; they defend the rights of
                  the south; they advocate Colonization, or point out the errors of Abolitionists,
                  but what one in word or in effect advocates the principles of human Slavery? The
                  truth is, brother, the system has the literature of the world against it; and the
                  south ought to see in this reading age an infallible sign that the days of its
                  cherished institutions are numbered. Does thee not perceive that every novel and
                  every poem carries to the parlor, or, if it please thee, to the theatre, an
                  influence which will eventually re-act on the ballot-box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Frank. Do you mean, mother, to include in your remarks the
                  discourses of Reverend Divines upon the Patriarchal Institution?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. G. I cannot except even these; for they acknowledge it an evil,
                  though they contend its exists by divine ordination, just as they assert Original
                  Sin to be the offspring of Eternal Decrees; but they no more convince the
                  Slaveholder, that he loves his bondman as himself, than they convict him of the
                  guilt of Adam's transgression.</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>Mr. F. What do you say to Webster's great speech on the compromise

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. G. (Pleasantly.) Is not the moral view of a question, about as

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mr. F. Oh, no; go on, your strictures are quite amusing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. G. Well, then, since <emph>we</emph> have taken the position of
                  a reviewer, <emph>we</emph> must confess that the last effort of the great Daniel

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. G. (Continuing.) It did not touch the merits of slavery at all.
                  Webster knew the feelings of the constituents too well to attempt such a task. He
                  therefore skilfully diverted their attention from his real issue, to the glorious
                  Union, and its danger from agitators, and he thus carried with him the sympathies
                  of many honest haters of oppression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mr. F. Well, sister, I do not know but you will<pb n="218-219"

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. G. Only such advocates as there is for robbery and war. Those
                  who find it for their interest to practice these crimes condemn them in the
                  abstract, or at most only apologize for them, as necessary and expedient, under
                  peculiar circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Frank. (Laughing.) Why, mother, I shall certainly subscribe for your
                  "North American Review," particularly if you fill the literary department as ably
                  as you have the moral and political, to test which, let me propound a question? If
                  the reward of the good be the charm of fiction, how do you account for the
                  pleasure derived from tragedy, where the good are overwhelmed with the evil?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. G. (Smiling.) With great diffidence we reply to the query of
                  our learned friend. The force of tragedy consists in its depicting evil so ruinous
                  as to involve even the innocent in the catastrophe; the pleasure is derived, we
                  think, from the <emph>failure</emph> of the mischievous design, and the merited
                  retribution which falls upon the head of the plotters. In Romeo, "a scourge is
                  laid upon the hate of the Montagues and Capulets, by which all are punished;"
                  Hamlet's wicked uncle is justly served, drinking the poison tempered by himself;
                  and Iago pulls down ruin upon himself no less than upon Cassio.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Frank. (Bowing playfully.) Your review meets my entire approbation,
                  inasmuch as it confirms my doctrine, that theatres always give their verdict in
                  favor of virtue.</p>

                  wrought upon what critics call the "sympathetic emotion of virtue," and the
                  decisions of this faculty, so far as we understand them, always correspond with
                  what Christians believe concerning the "final restitution of all things."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Frank. The theatre, then, ought to promote good morals—why does it

                  weakens the moral sense; thus people may read the best of books, and witness the
                  finest exhibitions of moral beauty, and constantly retrograde in virtue. The
                  dissolute characters of players, who continually utter the loftiest sentiments,
                  and practice the lowest vices, are accounted for on this principle; and we ought
                  to judge the theatre as we do slavery, by its demoralizing effect upon those
                  engaged in it.</p>

                  and love, and is it not easier to do this now than it was twenty years ago, when,
                  with a heart full of tenderness and truth, thee left us for thy southern home?</p>

                  and its kindred humbugs? Of course I don't! Show me the man who does? Do I follow
                  the precepts of the sermon on the Mount? Not I! The man who should undertake to do
                  so would make himself a perfect laughing-stock. I should like to see one of your
                  northern hypocrites attempt it. Ha! ha! ha! "Lay not up treasure upon earth," and
                  "take no thought for the morrow;" why, what else do people take thought for,
                  either North or South? It is not what they shall eat, drink, or wear to-day, that
                  worries them, but how they shall lay up something for themselves or their children
                  hereafter. You silly women are always talking about righteousness, as if you
                  really thought it could enter in human plans, but we men of the world, who have to
                  wring the precious dollar from the hard hand of labor, know better! I tell you,
                  Rebecca, I don't believe there is a business-man in your pious Quaker city even,
                  who would dare acquaint his wife and daughters with all his little arrangements
                  for amassing wealth. Ha! ha! ha! How the pretty things would stare at the tricks
                  of the trade, and simper: "Is that right?" As though anybody thought business

                  ridiculous! You ought to know that every man acts on the principle, that "Wealth

                  the advantage of you entirely. They do right to work, and grind it out of the
                  slaves on a large scale, and call Abraham and Moses to witness the patriarchal
                  method, while your northern mercenaries scheme and speculate how they can turn a
                  penny out of ignorance and poverty, and have not even the apology of a precedent
                  for their meanness. Why, one of our generous southern planters is as far above one
                  of your stingy shave-three-cents-on-a-yard-tradesmen, as Robin Hood is above a
                  miserable tea-spoon burglar. The south sails under false colors, does it? What
                  flag do your platform men give to the wind, I should like to know? What do they
                  care for the Fugitive Slave Law? Half of them would help a runaway to Canada with

                  nation on the earth, nor yet a Christian church, that dare venture entirely upon
                  the principles of the Gospel. Still, the aberration of reformers proves no more in
                  favor of slavery, than the vices and miseries of civilized life prove that
                  barbarism is the natural and happy state of the human race; nay, these very
                  aberrations prove that a centripetal power counteracts the opposing force, and
                  holds them within the genial influence of the sun of truth.</p>
               <p>The law of spiritual gravitation is little understood. But thousands of
                  philosophers are closely observing the phenomena, and carefully comparing them
                  with the data given in the Sermon on the Mount; and it is not too much to hope
                  that this generation will give to the world a Newton, whose moral mathematics
                  shall demonstrate that the <emph>law</emph> of <emph>love</emph> is the true

                  <hi rend="i"/>Mr. F. Well, sister, I wish you much joy of your millennial state;

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. G. Observe, my friends, that the Sermon on the Mount puts
                  blessing before requirement. If you accept these beatitudes as the gift of your
                  Divine Master, you will find that obedience to the precepts which follow, is not
                  the unwilling service of a bondsman, but the free and natural action of an
                  unfranchised spirit.</p>

               <head>A Time of Justice Will Come.</head>
               <p>WE are conscious of the odium that rests upon us.</p>
               <p>We feel that we are wronged; but we are not impatient for the righting of our
                  wrongs. We bide our time. The men that shall come after us, will do us justice.
                  The present generation of America cannot "judge righteous judgment," in the case
                  of the uncompromising friends of freedom, religion, and law. They are so debauched
                  and blinded by slavery, and by the perverse and low ideas of freedom, religion,
                  and law, which it engenders, that they "call evil good, and good evil; put
                  darkness for light, and light for darkness; put bitter for sweet, and sweet for
                  bitter." They have been living out the lie of slavery so long, and have been,
                  thereby, deadening their consciences so long, as to be now well nigh incapable of
                  perceiving the wide and everlasting distinctions between truth and falsehood.</p>

               <head>A Letter that Speaks for Itself.</head>
               <head type="sub">To T—— M——</head>
               <p>DISINTERESTED benevolence, my dear sir, has nothing at all to do with
                  abolitionism. Nay. I doubt very much if there is such a thing as disinterested
                  benevolence; but be this as it may, there is no occasion for it in the
                  anti-slavery ranks.</p>
               <p>It is selfishness,—sheer selfishness, that has thus far carried on the war with
                  slavery and wrong in all times; and selfishness must break the chains of the
                  American slave.</p>
               <p>Self-love has fixed the chain around the arm of every leader and every soldier in
                  the American anti-slavery army. Where would William Lloyd Garrison have been
                  to-day, if any combination of circumstances could have shut in his soul's deep
                  hatred of oppression, and prevented its finding utterance in burning words? He
                  would have been dead and rotten. It is necessary to his own existence that he
                  should work,—work for the slave; and in his work he gratifies all the strongest
                  instincts of his nature, more completely than even the grossest sensualist can
                  gratify <emph>his,</emph> by unlimited indulgence.</p>
               <p>Gerritt Smith, too. Suppose he was compelled to hoard his princely fortune, or
                  spend it as most others do! O dear! what a dyspeptic we should have in six months;
                  and all the hydropathic institutes in the country could never keep him alive five
                  years.</p>
               <p>John P. Hale would soon be done with his rotund person and jovial face, if he
                  could no longer send the sharp arrows of his wit and sarcasm into the consciences
                  of his human-whipping neighbors.</p>
               <p>It is a necessity of all great nations to hate meanness, and nothing under God's
                  heaven ever was so mean as American slavery. Think of it. <emph>Men</emph> who
                  swagger around with pistols and bowie-knifes to avenge their insulted honor, if
                  any one should question it,—imagine one turning up his sleeves to horse-whip an
                  old woman for burning his steak, or pocketing her wages, earned at the
                  wash-tub!</p>
               <p>No one with a soul above that of a pig-louse, could<pb n="232-233"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000123"/> help loathing the system, the instant he saw it in
                  its native meanness. Then, in order to keep his own self-respect,—to gratify the
                  love of the good and true in his own soul, he <emph>must</emph> express that
                  loathing.</p>
               <p>No disinterestedness about doing right, for nobody can be so much interested in
                  the act as the door of it.</p>
               <p>Wrong-doing is the only possible self-abnegation, of which the whole range of
                  thought admits.</p>
               <p>All the humiliation and agony of the Saviour himself, were necessary to himself.
                  Nothing less could have expressed the infinite love of the Divine nature; and in
                  working out a most perfect righteousness for those he loved, he also wrought out a
                  most perfect happiness for himself.</p>
               <p>The eternal law of God links the happiness of all the creatures made in His image
                  in an electric chain, united in the Divine love; and He, who has "a fellow-feeling
                  for our infirmities," has given us a fellow-feeling with the sufferings of each
                  other. So that no soul in which the Divine image is not totally obscured, can know
                  of the misery of another, without a sympathetic throb of sorrow.</p>
               <p>The true heart in Maine <emph>cannot</emph> know that the slave-mother in Georgia
                  is weeping for her children, torn from her arms by avarice, without feeling her
                  anguish palpitating in its inmost core.</p>
               <p>It is the pulsations of the sympathetic heart which stretches out the hand to
                  interfere between her and her aggressor; and abolitionists are just seeking a soft
                  pillow that they may "sleep o' nights."</p>
               <p>It is selfishness, I tell you, all selfishness! The great whale when she gives up
                  her own large life to protect her young one, and the little wren when she carries
                  all the nice tit bits to her babies, are as true to themselves as the old pig when
                  she shoulders all her little family out of the trough.</p>
               <p>The whale enjoys death, and the wren her little fellows' supper, with a better
                  zest than an old grunter does her corn, and Wm. Gildersten in spending money and
                  laboring to prevent any more scenes of brutal violence in his State, by punishing
                  the one past, gratifies his own loves and longings quite as much as Judge Grier in
                  grunting out his wrath against all lovers of liberty.</p>
               <p>The one would enjoy being hanged for the cause of God and Humanity, more than the
                  other would the luxury of hanging him, even if he could have <emph>all</emph> the
                  pleasure to himself,—be not only judge and persecutor<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000124"/> tor, as he prefers, but marshal, jailor, and
                  hangman to boot.</p>
               <p>More than this, every creature, so far as other creatures are concerned, has a
                  right to be happy in his own way. Nero had as much right to wish for power to cut
                  off all the heads in Italy at one blow, as an innocent pig to wish for capacity to
                  eat all the corn in the world. Mankind has no right to punish either for the
                  desire or its manifestation, They should only make fences to prevent the
                  accomplishment of the wish.</p>
               <p>Americans have no right to punish Judge Grier for wishing to prosecute everybody
                  who attempts to enforce State laws against murderous assaults by <emph>his</emph>
                  officers. They should content themselves with fencing his Honor in, or, if
                  necessary, putting a ring in his nose. He has as much right to be Judge Grier as
                  George Washington had to be George Washington, and is no more selfish in following
                  the instincts of his nature, than Washington was in following his.</p>

               <head>Mary Smith,</head>
               <head type="sub">AN ANTI-SLAVERY REMINISCENCE.</head>
               <p>SOME years ago a free colored woman, who was born in New England, and had gone to
                  the south to attend upon some family, was shipwrecked, as she was returning
                  northwards, on the coast of North Carolina. She, however, as well as some of the
                  crew of the vessel, was saved. The half-civilized people of that region rendered
                  some assistance to the shipwrecked party; but Mary Smith was detained by one of
                  the natives as a slave.</p>
               <p>The poor woman succeeded in getting a letter written to some person in Boston, in
                  which the particulars of her story were narrated. Either this letter, or one
                  afterwards written, contained references to people in Boston who were acquainted
                  with her.</p>
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6562-00000126"/>
               <p>It was not very easy, even with these references, to get sufficient evidence to
                  prove the freedom and identity of an obscure person, who had been away from Boston
                  for some years. A strong interest, however, was felt in the case wherever it
                  became known. And Rev. Samuel Snowden, well-remembered by the name of Father
                  Snowden, with his usual indomitable energy and perseverance in aiding persons of
                  his own color in distress, succeeded in finding people in Boston who were well
                  acquainted with Mary Smith, and recollected her having left that place to go to
                  the south. Pursuing his inquiries with great diligence, he ascertained the place
                  of her birth, which was somewhere in New Hampshire. I forget the name of the
                  town.</p>
               <p>Affidavits were now procured, which established the place of Mary Smith's birth,
                  her residence in Boston, and the time of her departure for the south, and other
                  circumstances to corroborate her story.</p>
               <p>Edward Everett, who was at this time Governor of Massachusetts, at the request of
                  Mary Smith's friends, forwarded the documents they had obtained, accompanied with
                  an urgent letter from himself, demanding her release from captivity, on the ground
                  of her being a free citizen of Massachusetts.</p>
               <p>The Governor of North Carolina replied very courteously to Governor Everett. He
                  admitted the right of the woman to her freedom, and acknowledged that no person in
                  North Carolina could lawfully detain her as a slave. But, at the same time he
                  said, that as Governor, he had no power to interfere with the person who held her
                  in custody. The decision on her right to freedom, depended on another department
                  of the government. He promised, however, to write to the man who held her, and
                  solicit her release.</p>
               <p>The remonstrances of the Governor of North Carolina proved successful. Mary Smith
                  soon arrived in Boston. And some of her old acquaintances who had given the
                  evidence which led to her release, hastened to meet her and congratulate her on
                  her escape from bondage. At the meeting they looked on her for some moments with
                  astonishment, for they could trace in her features no resemblance to their former
                  companion. A speedy explanation took place, from which it appeared that all the
                  documents sent to North Carolina related to one Mary Smith; but the woman whose
                  liberty they procured, was another Mary Smith.</p>

               <p>Governor Everett had a hearty laugh when Father Snowden told him the happy result
                  of his letter to the Governor of North Carolina.</p>
               <p>The moral of this story is, that a plain, common name, is sometimes more useful to
                  its owner, than a more brilliant one.<ref rend="super" target="#note_008"

               <head>Freedom—Liberty.</head>
               <p>FREEDOM and Liberty are synonymes. Freedom is an essence; Liberty, an accident.
                  Freedom is born with a man; Liberty may be conferred on him. Freedom is
                  progressive; Liberty is circumscribed. Freedom is the gift of God; Liberty, the
                  creature of society. Liberty may be taken away from a man; but, on whatsoever soul
                  Freedom may alight, the course of that soul is thenceforth onward and upward;
                  society, customs, laws, armies, are but as wythes in its giant grasp, if they
                  oppose, instruments to work its will, if they assent. Human kind welcome the birth
                  of a free soul with reverence and shoutings, rejoicing in the advent of a fresh
                  off-shoot of the Divine Whole, of which this is but a part.</p>

                  knocked down with a mace and partially shackled. The fugitive, who had
                  unsuspectingly waited upon them during their breakfast at the Phenix Hotel, was a
                  tall, noble-looking, remarkably intelligent, and a nearly white mulatto; after a
                  desperate effort and severe struggle, he shook off his <emph>five</emph>

                  from the house and plunged into the water, exclaiming: "I will drown rather than
                  be taken alive." He was pursued and fired upon several times, the last ball taking
                  effect in his head, his face being instantly covered with blood. He sprang up and
                  shrieked in great agony, and no doubt would have sunk at once, but<pb n="244-245"

                  <head>Extract.</head>
                  <p>NO colored man, with any nervous sensibility, can stand before an American
                     audience without an intense and painful sense of the disadvantages imposed by
                     his color. He feels little borne up by that brotherly sympathy and generous
                     enthusiasm, which give wings to the eloquence, and strength to the hearts of
                     other men, who advocate other and more popular causes. The ground which a
                     colored man occupies in this country is, every inch of it, sternly<pb
                        n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6562-00000135"/> disputed. Sir, were I a white man,
                     speaking for the right of white men, I should in this country have a smooth sea
                     and a fair wind. It is, perhaps, creditable to the American people (and I am
                     not the man to detract from their credit) that they listen eagerly to the
                     report of wrongs endured by distant nations. The Hungarian, the Italian, the
                     Irishman, the Jew and the Gentile, all find in this goodly land a home; and
                     when any of them, or all of them, desire to speak, they find willing ears, warm
                     hearts, and open hands. For these people, the Americans have principles of
                     justice, maxims of mercy, sentiments of religion, and feelings of brotherhood
                     in abundance. But for <emph>my</emph> poor people, (alas, how poor!)—enslaved,
                     scourged, blasted, overwhelmed, and ruined, it would appear that America had
                     neither justice, mercy, nor religion. She has no scales in which to weigh our
                     wrongs, and no standard by which to measure our rights. Just here lies the
                     grand difficulty of the colored man's cause. It is found in the fact, that we
                     may not avail ourselves of the just force of admitted American principles. If I
                     do not misinterpret the feelings and philosophy of my white fellow-countrymen
                     generally, they wish us to understand distinctly and fully that they have no
                     other use for us whatever, than to coin dollars out of our blood.</p>
                  <p>Our position here is anomalous, unequal, and extraordinary. It is a position to
                     which the most courageous of our race cannot look without deep concern. Sir, we
                     are a hopeful people, and in this we are fortunate; but for this trait of our
                     character, we should have, long before this seemingly unpropitious hour, sunk
                     down under a sense of utter despair.</p>
                  <p>Look at it, sir. Here, upon the soil of our birth, in a country which has known
                     us for two centuries, among a people who did not wait for us to seek them, but
                     who sought us, found us, and brought us to their own chosen land,—a people for
                     whom we have performed the humblest services, and whose greatest comforts and
                     luxuries have been won from the soil by our sable and sinewy arms,—I say, sir,
                     among such a people, and with such obvious recommendations to favor, we are far
                     less esteemed than the veriest stranger and sojourner.</p>
                  <p>Aliens are we in our native land. The fundamental principles of the republic,
                     to which the humblest white man, whether born here or elsewhere, may appeal
                     with confidence in the hope of awakening a favorable<pb n="254-255"
                        xml:id="VAC6562-00000136"/> response, are held to be inapplicable to us. The
                     glorious doctrines of your revolutionary fathers, and the more glorious
                     teachings of the Son of God, are construed and applied against us. We are
                     literally scourged beyond the beneficent range of both authorities,—human and
                     divine. We plead for our rights, in the name of the immortal declaration of
                     independence, and of the written constitution of government, and we are
                     answered with imprecations and curses. In the sacred name of Jesus we beg for
                     mercy, and the slave-whip, red with blood, cracks over us in mockery. We invoke
                     the aid of the ministers of Him who came "to preach deliverance to the
                     captive," and to set at liberty them that are bound, and from the loftiest
                     summits of this ministry comes the inhuman and blasphemous response, saying: if
                     one prayer would move the Almighty arm in mercy to break your galling chains,
                     that prayer would be withheld. We cry for help to humanity—a common humanity,
                     and here too we are repulsed. American humanity hates us, scorns us, disowns
                     and denies, in a thousand ways, our very personality. The outspread wing of
                     American Christianity, apparently broad enough to give shelter to a perishing
                     world, refuses to cover us. To us, its bones are brass, and its feathers iron.
                     In running thither for shelter and succor, we have only fled from the hungry
                     bloodhound to the devouring wolf,—from a corrupt and selfish world to a hollow
                     and hypocritical church.</p>

                  <p>Agis, King of Lacedemon and colleague of Leonidas, was a youth of
                     singular purity and promise. Aiming to correct the abuses which had crept
                     into the Spartan polity, he introduced regenerative laws. Among others,
                     one for the equalization of property, and as an example of disinterested
                     liberality, shared his estate with the community. Unappreciated by the
                     degenerated Senate however, he was deposed, and, with his whole family,
                     strangled by order of the ingrate State.—<title>Edin. Encyc.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is said that when Jugurtha was led before the car of the conquerer, he
                     lost his senses. After the triumph he was thrown into prison, where,
                     whilst they were in haste to strip him, some tore his robes off his back,
                     and others, catching eagerly at his pendants, pulled off the tips of his
                     ears with them. When he was thrust down naked into the dungeon, all wild
                     and confused, he said, with a frantic smile, "Heavens! how cold is this
                     bath of yours!" There struggling for six days with starvation, and to the
                     last hour laboring for the preservation of his life, he came to his
                     end.—<title>Plut. Cai. Mar.</title>

                  <p>Though Socrates and Plato, particularly the former, are generally
                     admitted by writers of authority, among whom, indeed, are Polycarpe,
                     Chrysotom, and Eusebius, to have in a manner <emph>suspected</emph>
                     rather than believed, the immortality of the soul; yet we have no
                     evidence of their ever having, by the finest process of ratiocination, so
                     thoroughly convinced themselves as to introduce it generally as a tenable
                     thesis on the portico. A beautiful thread of implicit belief and fervent
                     hope, of after life, assimilating to the hunting-ground of our own
                     American Indians, and though sensuous still, a step far in advance of the
                     black void of ancient philosophy, has always run through the higher
                     mythologies of the Negro. So notorious, indeed, was the fact among early
                     Christians, that that ubiquitous riddle, "Prestor John," was, by
                     believers, regarded as having a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">locale</foreign>

                  <p>The imagination of the African, like his musical genius, which extracts

                     seems to invest everything with a resident spirit of peculiar power.

                           Melinda, in Zanguebar, and sailing thence arrived at Calcutta in May.
                           This expedition, second to none in its results, save that of Columbus six
                           years before, drew the attention of all Europe. Whole nations became
                           actuated by the same enthusiasm, and private companies of merchants sent
                           out whole fleets on voyages of discovery, scouring the entire coast from
                           Cape Verd to Gaudfui, and discovering the Mascharenhas and most of the

                        secular affairs, with a view of emolument. For a peculiar illustration of
                        this favorite doctrine, see Clement VI.'s edict, when, in virtue of the
                        right arrogated by the holy see to dispose of all countries belonging to
                        the heathen, he erected (1344) the Canaries into a kingdom, and disposed

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,—</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>Your note of November 29th, requesting a line from me for the Autographs for
                  Freedom, is received.</p>
               <p>I wish that I had something that would add to the literary value of your laudable
                  enterprise. In so great a cause as that of human liberty, every great interest in
                  society ought to have a voice and a decisive testimony. Art should be in sympathy
                  with freedom and literature, and all human learning should speak with unmistakable
                  accents for the elevation, evangelization, and liberation of the oppressed. In a
                  future day, the historian cannot purge our political history from the shame of
                  wanton and mercenary oppression. But there is not, I believe, a book in the
                  literature of our<pb n="274" xml:id="VAC6562-00000147"/> country that will be
                  alive and known a hundred years hence, in which can be found the taint of
                  despotism. The literature of the world is on the side of liberty.</p>

               </head>
               <head>A Day Spent at Playford Hall.</head>
               <p>IT was a pleasant morning in May,—I believe that is the orthodox way of beginning
                  a story,—when C. and I took the cars to go into the country to Playford Hall. "And
                  what's Playford Hall?" you say. "And why did you go to see it?" As to what it is,
                  here is a reasonably good picture before you. As to why, it was for many years the
                  residence of Thomas Clarkson, and is now the residence of his venerable widow and
                  her family.</p>
               <p>Playford Hall is considered, I think, the oldest of the fortified houses in
                  England, and is, I am told, the only one that has water in the moat. The water
                  which is seen girdling the wall in the picture, is the moat; it surrounds the
                  place entirely, leaving no access except across the bridge, which is here
                  represented.</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6562-00000150"/>
               <p>After crossing this bridge, you come into a green court-yard, filled with choice
                  plants and flowering shrubs, and carpeted with that thick, soft, velvet-like
                  grass, which is to be found nowhere else in so perfect a state as in England.</p>
               <p>The water is fed by a perpetual spring, whose current is so sluggish as scarcely
                  to be perceptible, but which yet has the vitality of a running stream.</p>
               <p>It has a dark and glassy stillness of surface, only broken by the forms of the
                  water plants, whose leaves float thickly over it.</p>
               <p>The walls of the moat are green with ancient moss, and from the crevices springs
                  an abundant flowering vine, whose delicate leaves and bright yellow flowers in
                  some places entirely mantled the stones with their graceful drapery.</p>
               <p>The picture I have given you represents only one side of the moat. The other side
                  is grown up with dark and thick shrubbery and ancient trees, rising and embowering
                  the whole place, adding to the retired and singular effect of the whole. The place
                  is a specimen of a sort of thing which does not exist in America. It is one of
                  those significant landmarks which unite the present with the past, for which we
                  must return to the country of our origin.</p>
               <p>Playford Hall is a thing peculiarly English, and Thomas Clarkson, for whose sake I
                  visited it, was as peculiarly an Englishman,—a specimen of the very best kind of
                  English mind and character, as this is of characteristic English architecture.</p>
               <p>We Anglo-Saxons have won a hard name in the world. There are undoubtedly bad
                  things which are true about us.</p>
               <p>Taking our developments as a race, both in England and America, we may be justly
                  called the Romans of the nineteenth century. We have been the race which has
                  conquered, subdued, and broken in pieces, other weaker races, with little regard
                  either to justice or mercy. With regard to benefits by us imparted to conquered
                  nations, I think a better story, on the whole, can be made out for the Romans,
                  than for us. Witness the treatment of the Chinese, of the tribes of India, and of
                  our own American Indians.</p>
               <p>But still there is an Anglo-Saxon blood, a vigorous sense of justice, as appears
                  in our Habeas Corpus, our jury trials, and other features of State organization,
                  and, when this is tempered in individuals, with the<pb n="280-281"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000151"/> elements of gentleness and compassion, and enforced
                  by that energy and indomitable perseverance which are characteristic of the
                  Anglo-Saxon mind, they form a style of philanthropists peculiarly efficient. In
                  short, the Anglo-Saxon is efficient, in whatever he sets himself about, whether in
                  crushing the weak, or lifting them up.</p>
               <p>Thomas Clarkson was born in a day when good, pious people, imported cargoes of
                  slaves from Africa, as one of the regular Christianized modes of gaining a
                  subsistence, and providing for them and their house-holds. It was a thing that
                  everybody was doing, and everybody thought they had a right to do. It was supposed
                  that all the coffee, tea, and sugar in the world were dependent on stealing men,
                  women, and children, and could be got no other way; and as to consume coffee,
                  sugar, rice, and rum, were evidently the chief ends of human existence, it
                  followed that men, women, and children, must be stolen to the end of time.</p>
               <p>Some good people, when they now and then heard an appalling story of the cruelties
                  practiced in the slave ship, declared that it was really too bad, sympathetically
                  remarked, "What a sorrowful world we live in," stirred their sugar into their tea,
                  and went on as before, because, what was there to do—hadn't everybody always done
                  it, and if they didn't do it, wouldn't somebody else?</p>
               <p>It is true that for many years individuals, at different times, remonstrated, had
                  written treatises, poems, stories, and movements had been made by some religious
                  ladies, particularly the Quakers, but the opposition had amounted to nothing
                  practically efficient.</p>
               <p>The attention of Clarkson was first turned to the subject by having it given out
                  as the theme for a prize composition in his college class, he being at that time a
                  sprightly young man, about twenty-four years of age. He entered into the
                  investigation with no other purpose than to see what he could make of it as a
                  college theme.</p>
               <p>He says of himself: "I had expected pleasure from the invention of arguments, from
                  the arrangement of them, from the putting of them together, and from the thought,
                  in the interim, that I was engaged in an innocent contest for literary honor, but
                  all my pleasures were damped by the facts, which were now continually before
                  me.</p>
               <p>"It was but one gloomy subject from morning till<pb n="282-283"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000152"/> night; in the day time I was uneasy, in the night I
                  had little rest, I sometimes never closed my eyelids for grief."</p>
               <p>It became not now so much a trial for academical reputation as to write a work
                  which should be useful to Africa. It is not surprising that a work, written under
                  the force of such feelings, should have gained the prize, as it did. Clarkson was
                  summoned from London to Cambridge, to deliver his prize essay publicly. He says of
                  himself, on returning back to London: "The subject of it almost wholly engrossed
                  my thoughts. I became at times very seriously affected while on the road. I
                  stopped my horse occasionally, dismounted, and walked.</p>
               <p>"I frequently tried to persuade myself that the contents of my essay could not be
                  true, but the more I reflected on the authorities on which they were founded, the
                  more I gave them credit. Coming in sight of Wade's Mill, in Hertfordshire, I sat
                  down disconsolate on the turf by the roadside, and held my horse. Here a thought
                  came into my mind, that if the contents of the essay were true, it was time that
                  somebody should see these calamities to an end."</p>
               <p>These reflections, as it appears, were put off for awhile, but returned again.</p>
               <p>This young and noble heart was of a kind that could not comfort itself so easily
                  for a brother's sorrow as many do.</p>
               <p>He says of himself: "In the course of the autumn of the same year, I walked
                  frequently into the woods that I might think of the subject in solitude, and find
                  relief to my mind there; but there the question still recurred, 'are these things
                  true?' Still the answer followed as instantaneously, 'they are;' still the result
                  accompanied it,—surely some person should interfere. I began to envy those who had
                  seats in Parliament, riches, and widely-extended connections, which would enable
                  them to take up this cause.</p>
               <p>"Finding scarcely any one, at the time, who thought of it, I was turned frequently
                  to myself, but here many difficulties arose. It struck me, among others, that a
                  young man only twenty-four years of age could not have that solid judgment, or
                  that knowledge of men, manners, and things, which were requisite to qualify him to
                  undertake a task of such magnitude and importance; and with whom was I to unite? I
                  believed, also, that it looked so much like one of the<pb n="284-285"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000153"/> feigned labors of Hercules, that my understanding
                  would be suspected, if I proposed it."</p>
               <p>He however resolved to do something for the cause by translating his essay from
                  Latin into English, enlarging and presenting it to the public. Immediately on the
                  publication of this essay, he discovered to his astonishment and delight, that he
                  was not the only one who had been interested in this subject.</p>
               <p>Being invited to the house of William Dillwyn, one of these friends to the cause,
                  he says: "How surprised was I to learn, in the course of our conversation, of the
                  labors of Granville Sharp, of the writings of Ramsey, and of the controversy in
                  which the latter was engaged, of all which I had hitherto known nothing. How
                  surprised was I to learn that William Dillwyn had, himself, two years before,
                  associated himself with five others for the purpose of enlightening the public
                  mind on this great subject.</p>
               <p>"How astonished was I to find, that a society had been formed in America for the
                  same object. These thoughts almost overpowered me. My mind was overwhelmed by the
                  thought, that I had been providentially directed to this house; the finger of
                  Providence dence was beginning to be discernible, and that the day-star of African
                  liberty was rising."</p>
               <p>After this he associated with many friends of the cause, and at last it became
                  evident that in order to effect anything, he must sacrifice all other prospects in
                  life, and devote himself exclusively to this work.</p>
               <p>He says, after mentioning reasons which prevented all his associates from doing
                  this: "I could look, therefore, to no person but myself; and the question was,
                  whether I was prepared to make the sacrifice. In favor of the undertaking, I urged
                  to myself that never was any cause, which had been taken up by man, in any country
                  or in any age, so great and important; that never was there one in which so much
                  misery was heard to cry for redress; that never was there one in which so much
                  good could be done; never one in which the duty of Christian charity could be so
                  extensively exercised; never one more worthy of the devotion of a whole life
                  towards it; and that, if a man thought properly, he ought to rejoice to have been
                  called into existence, if he were only permitted to become an instrument in
                  forwarding it in any part of its progress.</p>
               <p>"Against these sentiments, on the other hand, I had<pb n="286-287"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000154"/> to urge that I had been designed for the church;
                  that I had already advanced as far as deacon's orders in it; that my prospects
                  there on account of my connections were then brilliant; that, by appearing to
                  desert my profession, my family would be dissatisfied, if not unhappy. These
                  thoughts pressed upon me, and rendered the conflict difficult.</p>
               <p>"But the sacrifice of my prospects staggered me, I own, the most. When the other
                  objections which I have related, occurred to me, my enthusiasm instantly, like a
                  flash of lightning, consumed them; but this stuck to me, and troubled me. I had
                  ambition. I had a thirst after worldly interest and honors, and I could not
                  extinguish it at once. I was more than two hours in solitude under this painful
                  conflict. At length I yielded, not because I saw any reasonable prospect of
                  success in my new undertaking, for all cool-headed and cool-hearted men would have
                  pronounced against it; but in obedience, I believe, to a higher Power. And I can
                  say, that both on the moment of this resolution, and for some time afterwards, I
                  had more sublime and happy feelings than at any former period of my life."</p>
               <p>In order to show how this enterprise was looked upon and talked of very commonly
                  by the majority of men in these times, we will extract the following passage from
                  Boswell's Life of Johnson, in which Bozzy thus enters his solemn protest: "The
                  wild and dangerous attempt, which has for some time been persisted in, to obtain
                  an act of our Legislature, to abolish so very important and necessary a branch of
                  commercial interest, must have been crushed at once, had not the insignificance of
                  the zealots, who vainly took the lead in it, made the vast body of planters,
                  merchants and others, whose immense properties are involved in that trade,
                  reasonably enough suppose, that there could be no danger. The encouragement which
                  the attempt has received, excites my wonder and indignation; and though some men
                  of superior abilities have supported it, whether from a love of temporary
                  popularity, when prosperous; or a love of general mischief, when desperate, my
                  opinion is unshaken.</p>
               <p>"To abolish a statute which in all ages God has sanctioned, and man has continued,
                  would not only be robbery to an innumerable class of our fellow-subjects, but it
                  would be extreme cruelty to the African savages, a portion of whom it saves from
                  massacre, or intolerable bondage in their own country, and introduces into<pb
                     n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6562-00000155"/> a much happier state of life;
                  especially now, when their passage to the West Indies, and their treatment there,
                  is humanely regulated. To abolish this trade, would be to <q>
                     <l>'——shut the gates of mercy on mankind.'"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>One of the first steps of Clarkson and his associates, was the formation of a
                  committee of twelve persons, for the collection and dissemination of evidence on
                  the subject.</p>
               <p>The contest now began in earnest, a contest as sublime as any the world ever
                  saw.</p>
               <p>The Abolition controversy more fully aroused the virtue, the talent, and the
                  religion of the great English nation, than any other event or crisis which ever
                  occurred.</p>
               <p>Wilberforce was the leader of the question in Parliament. The other members of the
                  Anti-slavery Committee performed those labors which were necessary out of it.</p>
               <p>This labor consisted principally in the collection of evidence with regard to the
                  traffic, and the presentation of it before the public mind. In this labor Clarkson
                  was particularly engaged. The subject was hemmed in with the same difficulties
                  that now beset the Anti-slavery cause in America. Those who knew most about it,
                  were precisely those whose interest it was to prevent inquiry. An immense moneyed
                  interest was arrayed against investigation, and was determined to suppress the
                  agitation of the subject. Owing to this powerful pressure, many who were in
                  possession of facts which would bear upon this subject, refused to communicate
                  them; and often after a long and wearisome journey in search of an individual who
                  could throw light upon the subject, Clarkson had the mortification to find his
                  lips sealed by interest or timidity. As usual, the cause of oppression was
                  defended by the most impudent lying; the slave-trade was asserted to be the latest
                  revised edition of philanthropy. It was said that the poor African, the slave of
                  miserable oppression in his own country, was wafted by it to an asylum in a
                  Christian land; that the middle passage was to the poor negro a perfect elysium,
                  infinitely happier than anything he had ever known in his own country. All this
                  was said while manacles, and hand-cuffs, and thumb-screws, and instruments to
                  force open the mouth, were a regular part<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6562-00000156"
                  /> of the stock for a slave ship, and were hanging in the shop windows of
                  Liverpool for sale.</p>
               <p>For Clarkson's attention was first called to these things by observing them in the
                  shop window, and on inquiring the use of one of them, the man informed him that
                  many times negroes were sulky and tried to starve themselves to death, and this
                  instrument was used to force open their jaws.</p>
               <p>Of Clarkson's labor in this investigation some idea may be gathered from his own
                  words, when stating that for a season he was compelled to retire from the cause,
                  he thus speaks. "As far as I myself was concerned, all exertion was then over. The
                  nervous system was almost shattered to pieces. Both my memory and my hearing
                  failed me. Sudden dizzinesses seized my head. A confused singing in the ear
                  followed me wherever I went. On going to bed the very stairs seemed to dance up
                  and down under me, so that, misplacing my foot, I sometimes fell. Talking, too, if
                  it continued but half an hour, exhausted me so that profuse perspirations
                  followed, and the same effect was produced even by an active exertion of the mind
                  for the like time.</p>
               <p>These disorders had been brought on by degrees, in consequence of the severe
                  labors necessarily attached to the promotion of the cause. For seven years I had a
                  correspondence to maintain with four hundred persons, with my own hand; I had some
                  book or other annually to write in behalf of the cause. In this time I had
                  traveled more than thirty-five thousand miles in search of evidence, and a great
                  part of these journeys in the night. All this time my mind had been on the
                  stretch. It had been bent too to this one subject, for I had not even leisure to
                  attend to my own concerns. The various instances of barbarity which had come
                  successively to my knowledge within this period, had vexed, harrassed, and
                  afflicted it. The wound which these had produced was rendered still deeper by
                  those cruel disappointments before related, which arose from the reiterated
                  refusals of persons to give their testimony, after I had traveled hundreds of
                  miles in quest of them. But the severest stroke was that inflicted by the
                  persecution, begun and pursued by persons interested in the continuance of the
                  trade, of such witnesses as had been examined against them; and whom, on account
                  of their dependent situation in life, it was most easy to oppress. As I had been
                  the means of bringing these forward on these occasions, they naturally<pb
                     n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6562-00000157"/> ally came to me, when thus persecuted,
                  as the author of their miseries and their ruin. From their supplications and wants
                  it would have been ungenerous and ungrateful to have fled. These different
                  circumstances, by acting together, had at length brought me into the situation
                  just mentioned; and I was therefore obliged, though very reluctantly, to be borne
                  out of the field, where I had placed the great honor and glory of my life."</p>
               <p>I may as well add here that a Mr. Whitbread, to whom Clarkson mentioned this
                  latter cause of distress, generously offered to repair the pecuniary losses of all
                  who had suffered in this cause. One anecdote will be a specimen of the energy with
                  which Clarkson pursued evidence. It had been very strenuously asserted and
                  maintained that the subjects of the slave trade were only such unfortunates as had
                  become prisoners of war, and who, if not carried out of the country in this
                  manner, would be exposed to death or some more dreadful doom in their own country.
                  This was one of those stories which nobody believed, and yet was particularly
                  useful in the hands of the opposition, because it was difficult legally to
                  disprove it. It was perfectly well known that in very many cases slave-traders
                  traders made direct incursions into the country, kidnapped, and carried off the
                  inhabitants of whole villages, but the question was, how to establish it? A
                  gentleman whom Clarkson accidentally met on one of his journeys, informed him that
                  he had been in company, about a year before, with a sailor, a very respectable
                  looking young man, who had actually been engaged in one of these expeditions; he
                  had spent half an hour with him at an inn; he described his person, but knew
                  nothing of his name or the place of his abode, all he knew was that he belonged to
                  a ship of war in ordinary, but knew nothing of the port. Clarkson determined that
                  this man should be produced as a witness, and knew no better way than to go
                  personally to all the ships in ordinary, until the individual was found. He
                  actually visited every sea-port town, and boarded every ship, till in the very
                     <emph>last</emph> port and on the very <emph>last</emph> ship which remained,
                  the individual was found, and found to be possessed of just the facts and
                  information which were necessary. By the labors of Clarkson and his cotemporaries
                  an incredible excitement was produced throughout all England. The pictures and
                  models of slave ships, accounts of the cruelties practised in the trade, were
                  circulated with<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6562-00000158"/> an industry which left
                  not a man, woman, or child in England uninstructed. In disseminating information,
                  and in awakening feeling and conscience, the women of England were particularly
                  earnest, and labored with that whole-hearted devotion which characterizes the
                  sex.</p>
               <p>It seems that after the committee had published the facts, and sent them to every
                  town in England, Clarkson followed them up by journeying to all the places, to see
                  that they were read and attended to. Of the state of feeling at this time,
                  Clarkson gives the following account:</p>
               <p>"And first I may observe, that there was no town through which I passed, in which
                  there was not some one individual who had left off the use of sugar. In the
                  smaller towns there were from ten to fifty, by estimation, and in the larger, from
                  two to five hundred, who made this sacrifice to virtue. These were of all ranks
                  and parties. Rich and poor, churchmen and dissenters had adopted the measure. Even
                  grocers had left off trading in the article in some places. In gentlemen's
                  families, where the master had set the example, the servants had often voluntarily
                  followed it; and even children, who were capable of understanding the history of
                  the sufferings of the Africans, excluded with the most virtuous resolution the
                  sweets, to which they had been accustomed, from their lips. By the best
                  computation I was able to make, from notes taken down in my journey, no fewer than
                  three hundred thousand persons had abandoned the use of sugar." It was the
                  reality, depth, and earnestness of the public feeling, thus aroused, which pressed
                  with resistless force upon the government; for the government of England yields to
                  popular demands, quite as readily as that of America.</p>
               <p>After years of protracted struggle, the victory was at last won. The slave-trade
                  was finally abolished through all the British empire; and not only so, but the
                  English nation committed, with the whole force of its national influence, to seek
                  the abolition of the slave-trade in all the nations of the earth. But the wave of
                  feeling did not rest there; the investigations had brought before the English
                  conscience the horrors and abominations of slavery itself, and the agitation never
                  ceased till slavery was finally abolished through all the British provinces. At
                  this time the religious mind and conscience of England gained, through this very
                  struggle, a power which it never has lost. The<pb n="296-297"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000159"/> principle adopted by them was the same so sublimely
                  adopted by the church in America, in reference to the Foreign Missionary cause:
                  "The field is the world." They saw and felt that as the example and practice of
                  England had been powerful in giving sanction to this evil, and particularly in
                  introducing it into America, that there was the greatest reason why she should
                  never intermit her efforts till the wrong was righted throughout the earth.</p>
               <p>Clarkson to his last day never ceased to be interested in the subject, and took
                  the warmest interest in all movements for the abolition of slavery in America.</p>
               <p>One of his friends, during my visit at this place, read me a manuscript letter
                  from him, written at a very advanced age, in which he speaks with the utmost ardor
                  and enthusiasm of the first anti-slavery movements of Cassius Clay in Kentucky.
                  The same friend described him to me as a cheerful, companionable being,—frank and
                  simple-hearted, and with a good deal of quiet humor.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable of him that with such intense feeling for human suffering as he
                  had, and worn down and exhausted as he was, by the dreadful miseries and sorrows
                  with which he was constantly obliged to be familiar, he never yielded to a spirit
                  of bitterness or denunciation.</p>
               <p>The narrative which he gives is as calm and unimpassioned, and as free from any
                  trait of this kind, as the narrative of the evangelist.</p>
               <p>I have given this sketch of what Clarkson did, that you may better appreciate the
                  feelings with which I visited the place.</p>
               <p>The old stone house, the moat, the draw-bridge, all spoke of days of violence long
                  gone by, when no man was safe except within fortified walls, and every man's house
                  literally had to be his castle.</p>
               <p>To me it was interesting as the dwelling of a conqueror, as one who had not
                  wrestled with flesh and blood merely, but with principalities and powers, and the
                  rulers of the darkness of this world, and who had overcome, as his great Master
                  did before him, by faith, and prayer, and labor.</p>
               <p>We were received with much cordiality by the widow of Clarkson, now in her
                  eighty-fourth year. She has been a woman of great energy and vigor, and an
                  efficient co-laborer in his plans of benevolence.</p>
               <p>She is now quite feeble. I was placed under the care of a respectable female
                  servant, who forthwith<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6562-00000160"/> installed me in
                  a large chamber overlooking the court-yard, which had been Clarkson's own room;
                  the room where for years, many of his most important labors had been conducted,
                  and from whence his soul had ascended to the reward of the just.</p>
               <p>The servant who attended me seemed to be quite a superior woman; like many of the
                  servants in respectable English families. She had grown up in the family, and was
                  identified with it; its ruling aims and purposes had become hers. She had been the
                  personal attendant of Clarkson, and his nurse during his last sickness; she had
                  evidently understood, and been interested in his plans, and the veneration with
                  which she therefore spoke of him, had the sanction of intelligent
                  appreciation.</p>
               <p>A daughter of Clarkson, who was married to a neighboring clergyman, with her
                  husband, was also present on this day.</p>
               <p>After dinner we rode out to see the old church, in whose enclosure the remains of
                  Clarkson repose. It was just such a still, quiet, mossy old church, as you have
                  read of in story-books, with the grave-yard spread all around it, like a
                  thoughtful mother, who watches the resting of her children.</p>
               <p>The grass in the yard was long and green, and the daisy, which in other places
                  lies like a little button on the ground, here had a richer fringe of crimson, and
                  a stalk about six inches high. It is, I well know, the vital influence from the
                  slumbering dust beneath, which gives the richness to this grass and these flowers;
                  but let not that be a painful thought; let it rather cheer us, that beauty should
                  spring from ashes, and life smile brighter from the near presence of death. The
                  grave of Clarkson was near the church, enclosed by a railing and marked by a
                  simple white marble slab; it was carefully tended and planted with flowers. In the
                  church was an old book of records, and among other curious inscriptions, was one
                  recording how a pious committee of old Noll's army had been there, knocking off
                  saints' noses, and otherwise purging the church from the relics of idolatry.</p>
               <p>Near by the church was the parsonage, the home of my friends, a neat, pleasant,
                  sequestered dwelling, of about the style of a New England country parsonage.</p>
               <p>The effect of the whole together was inexpressibly beautiful to me. For a wonder,
                  it was a pleasant day, and this is a thing always to be thankfully acknowledged<pb
                     n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6562-00000161"/> edged in England. The calm stillness of
                  the afternoon, the seclusion of the whole place, the silence only broken by the
                  cawing of the rooks, the ancient church, the mossy graves with their flowers and
                  green grass, the sunshine and the tree shadows, all seemed to mingle together in a
                  kind of hazy dream of peacefulness and rest. How natural it is to say of some
                  place sheltered, simple, cool, and retired, here one might find peace, as if peace
                  came from without, and not from within. In the shadiest and stillest places may be
                  the most turbulent hearts, and there are hearts which, through the busiest scenes,
                  carry with them unchanging peace. As we were walking back, we passed many cottages
                  of the poor.</p>
               <p>I noticed, with particular pleasure, the invariable flower garden attached to
                  each. Some pansies in one of them attracted my attention by their peculiar beauty,
                  so very large and richly colored. On being introduced to the owner of them, she,
                  with cheerful alacrity, offered me some of the finest. I do not doubt of there
                  being suffering and misery in the agricultural population of England, but still
                  there are multitudes of cottages, which are really very pleasant objects, as were
                  all these. The cottagers had that bright, rosy look of health which we seldom see
                  in America, and appeared to be both polite and self-respecting.</p>
               <p>In the evening we had quite a gathering of friends from the
                  neighborhood—intelligent, sensible, earnest, people—who had grown up in the love
                  of the anti-slavery cause as into religion. The subject of conversation was: "The
                  duty of English people to free themselves from any participation in American
                  slavery, by taking means to encourage the production of free cotton in the British
                  provinces."</p>
               <p>It is no more impossible or improbable that something effective may be done in
                  this way, than that the slave-trade should have been abolished. Every great
                  movement seems an impossibility at first. There is no end to the number of things
                  declared and proved impossible, which have been done already, so that this may do
                  something yet.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clarkson had retired from the room early; after a while she sent for me to
                  her sitting-room. The faithful attendant of whom I spoke was with her. She wished
                  to show me some relics of her husband, his watch and seals, some of his papers and
                  manuscripts; among these was the identical prize essay<pb n="302-303"
                     xml:id="VAC6562-00000162"/> with which he began his career, and a commentary on
                  the Gospels, which he had written with great care, for the use of his grandson.
                  His seal attracted my attention—it was that kneeling figure, of the negro, with
                  clasped hands, which was at first adopted as the badge of the cause, when every
                  means was being made use of to arouse the public mind and keep the subject before
                  the attention. Mr. Wedgewood, the celebrated procelain manufacturer, designed a
                  cameo, with this representation, which was much worn as an ornament by ladies. It
                  was engraved on the seal of the Anti-Slavery Society, and was used by its members
                  in sealing all their letters. This of Clarkson's was handsomely engraved on a
                  large, old-fashioned cornelian, and surely if we look with emotion on the sword of
                  a departed hero, which, at best, we can consider only as a necessary evil, we may
                  look with unmingled pleasure on this memorial of a bloodless victory.</p>
               <p>When I retired to my room for the night I could not but feel that the place was
                  hallowed—unceasing prayer had there been offered for the enslaved and wronged race
                  of Africa by that noble and brotherly heart. I could not but feel that that those
                  prayers had had a wider reach than the mere extinction of slavery in one land or
                  country, and that their benign influence would not cease till not a slave was left
                  upon the face of the earth.</p>

               <p>MUCH has been discussed and written, both at the North and South, concerning the
                  policy and propriety of permitting those in bondage to gain the rudiments of a
                  common education.</p>
               <p>Many who <emph>conscientiously</emph> (for having lived among them, I do believe
                  that there <emph>are</emph> "conscientious" slave-owners) hold their laborers in
                  servitude, believe that the experiment might be successfully tried. Indeed, it is
                  often tried on plantations, even in States where the law enforces strict penalties
                  against it. They believe that the slaves, if permitted to learn to road, would be
                  more moral, faithful and obedient; and they cannot reconcile it with their sense
                  of duty to keep from them the perusal of the Bible.</p>
               <p>The majority, however, think differently; and the majority will always make the
                  laws. <emph>They</emph> believe that there is a talismanic power in even the
                  alphabet of knowledge, to arouse in the bondsman powers which they would crush for
                  ever. They believe that one truth leads on to another, and that the mind, once
                  aroused to inquiry, will never rest until it has found out its native independence
                  of man's dominion. They point triumphantly, in proof of the policy of their
                  system, to the "spoiled slave," as they term many of those in whose training the
                  opposite course has been pursued. More trouble, vexation, and insubordination,
                  they confidently allege, has been caused by permitting slaves to learn to read,
                  than by any other indulgence.</p>
               <p>It may be so; it is certain that, in many instances, masters have failed to win
                  the gratitude to which they thought themselves justly entitled, for their kindness
                  and care. They have found their servants growing discontented and idle, where they
                  hoped to make them docile and happy. Searching for the cause of this, they perhaps
                  turn upon the course of training they have followed, and accuse it of being
                  opposed to the best interests of the slave. Could such reasoners but look upon the
                  matter in its true perspective, they would cease to wonder that "good" should, in
                  their view, "work out evil." <emph>Learning</emph> and <emph>Slavery</emph> can<pb
                     n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6562-00000164"/> never compromise; they are as the
                  antagonistic poles of the magnet.</p>
               <p>In the first place, Slavery blunts the mind, and renders it, in its early years,
                  unsusceptible to those impressions which are generally so lasting, when made upon
                  youthful minds. Many who have tried to educate colored children, have been led to
                  accuse <emph>the race</emph> of natural inferiority in its capacity to gain
                  knowledge. We have no right to draw <emph>that</emph> inference from the few
                  attempts which have been made on a part of the race whose mental faculties have,
                  through many generations, been crippled by disuse.</p>
               <p>I had once under my charge, for a short time, a negro girl, born in
                  Africa—"Margru" of the "Armistad," with whose history most are familiar. On
                     <emph>her</emph> ancestory hung no clog of depression, except that of native
                  wildness. There was no lack of aptitude to learn in her case. She astonished all
                  by the ease with which she acquired knowledge, particularly in mathematical
                  science. That a native heathen should be a better recipient of knowledge than one
                  brought up in the midst of American civilization, speaks well for "the race," but
                  ill for "the system," which has trained the latter.</p>
               <p>Not only is this native dulness to be overcome, but <emph>time</emph> for study is
                  to be found—time enough for the faculties to unbend from the pressure of labor,
                  and fix themselves upon the mental task. This is what few employers consider
                  themselves able to afford. Once a week, in their opinion, is quite often enough
                  for the slave to repeat his lesson; and through the week he may forget it. No
                  wonder that both the indulgent master and the teacher—yes, and the learner, too,
                  often become discouraged, and give up the task before the Word of God is unlocked
                  to "the poor," for whom it was expressly written!</p>
               <p>I speak as one who has <emph>felt</emph> these obstacles, having, with the
                  approval of one of the class to whom I have alluded, taken charge of a Sunday
                  school among his servants. More attentive and grateful pupils I never had, but it
                  has pained my heart to feel the difficulty of leading them even to the
                     <emph>threshold</emph> of knowledge; and there leaveing them!</p>
               <p>In an adjoining household, however, it was still worse. George, a light-colored
                  "boy" of twenty-five, the "factotum" of his mistress, was the husband of our cook,
                  Letty. I had succeeded in taking Letty<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6562-00000165"/>
                  through several chapters in the New Testament, and this had aroused the ambition
                  of George.</p>
               <p>"What do you think?" exclaimed one of the family to me, one morning; "Mrs. —— has
                  been <emph>whipping</emph> George!"</p>
               <p>"Why! for what could that have been? I thought he was a favorite servant!"</p>
               <p>"For taking lessons of Letty in the spelling-book!"</p>
               <p>It was even so. The poor fellow wanted to learn to stammer in his Testament, and
                  Letty, like any true-hearted wife, had given him the little assistance she could
                  render. The whipping failed of its intended effect, however. Going one evening, at
                  a late hour, into Letty's cabin, I found George seated by her on the floor, in the
                  corner of their mud fire-place, poring intently over the forbidden spelling-book!
                  He started up confused, but seeing who it was, he was reassured, and went on with
                  his lesson! Whether George, Letty, or any of those who have gained the rudiments
                  of science, will be <emph>more happy</emph> in their servitude, is to me
                  exceedingly doubtful. Thus far the severer classes of masters have the right; a
                  slave, to be perfectly contented <emph>as</emph> a slave, must be in total
                  ignorance. But better, far better, greater suffering, if it bring enlargement ment
                  of man's higher being, than that system that would <emph>smother</emph> the soul
                  in its bodily case. Let the slave have the key to the gate of Life Eternal, even
                  if his pathway through this life must be more thickly sown with thorns. Let the
                  opposing principles wage, until the right of <emph>one</emph> is asserted. And,
                  oh! above all pray for the day when these fetters shall be stricken from the souls
                  God has created, wherewith to people, we firmly trust, no mean "tabernacle" of His
                  New Jerusalem!</p>

            <p>BY REV. JOHN L. BLAKE, D. D. AUTHOR OF FARMER'S EVERY-DAY BOOK; THE FARMER AT HOME;

                  <p>DR. BLAKE is justly regarded as one of the best agricultural writers in the
                     country, and the work before us is one of the most interesting productions of
                     his pen. Its peculiar merit, as a work for the fireside, consists in the
                     variety of its topics, its plain and simple, yet attractive style, its fine
                     engravings, and the interesting romance which the author has thrown around
                     Rural and Agricultural Life. In this respect, "The Farm and the Fireside" is a
                     work well adapted to the youthful mind. We hope it may be extensively read, as
                     it cannot fail to improve the taste and promote inquiry in the most useful and
                     practical of all departments of science.</p>

                  <p>The aim of the author has been to throw over labor, home and agricultural life,
                     their true dignity and charm; to introduce the farmer to the delights and
                     privileges of his lot; to embellish the cares of toil with those kindly
                     sentiments so naturally associated with the country and its employments. It is
                     a pleasant book—one that will enliven the<pb n="314-315 (Advertisement) "

                     at the same time, impart a great deal of valuable agricultural knowledge. We
                     know not how the natural trains of thought of the farmer could be more aptly
                     met or more safely and agreeably led, than they are by these brief and varied
                     discussions. The range is as wide as life itself—morals, religion business,
                     recreation, education, home, wife and daughters—every relation and duty is
                     touched upon, genially and instinctively.</p>

                  <p>We have here another highly instructive and entertaining volume from an author,
                     who had laid the community under large obligations by the enterprise and tact
                     with which he has so frequently catered to the popular taste for descriptions
                     of rural life. Its contents are of a very miscellaneous character, embracing
                     sketches of natural history, accounts of successful farming operations,
                     anecdotes of distinguished characters, singular personal reminiscences, pithy
                     moral reflections, and numerous pictures of household life in the country. No
                     family can add this volume to their collection of books without increasing
                     their sources of pleasure and profit.</p>

                  <p>The venerable author of this work is entitled to the warmest thanks of the
                     public for his numerous and valuable contributions to our literature. He is
                     truly an American classic. We have been conversant with his writings for the
                     last twenty years, and have always found them both useful and entertaining in a
                     high degree. His writings on Agriculture contain much real science, with
                     numerous illustrative incidents, anecdotes, and aphorisms, all in the most
                     lively and pleasing manner. By this means the dry details of farming business
                     are made to possess all the interest of romance. The style is clear, easy, and
                     dignified; the matter instructive, philosophical, and persuasive. This work is
                     an eloquent plea for the noble and independent pursuit of Agriculture.</p>

                  <p>We return our thanks for the new volume of Dr. Blake, "The Farm and the
                     Fireside, or the Romance of Agriculture, being Half Hours and Sketches of Life
                     in the Country," a charming title, certainly, and one that smacks of the man,
                     as well as of the country. Eschewing the dryness of scientific forms and
                     erudite details, the author presents detached, but most entertaining, and often
                     very suggestive articles on a great variety of topics—from the "Wild Goose" to
                     "Conscience in the Cow,"—from the "Value of Lawyers in a Community" to the
                     "Objections to early Marriages." The book is, in fine, quite unique, and just
                     such a one as the farmer would like to pore over at his fireside on long winter
                     evenings.</p>

                     degree of satisfaction in saying that it possesses decided merit, and will
                     commend itself, wherever known, as a volume of much social interest and
                     entertainment. The sketches comprise "Country Life" generally—some of them are
                     just sufficiently touched with romance to give them additional zest; while
                     others are purely practical, and relate to the farmer's pursuit. We regard it
                     as a valuable book, and are sorry our limits will not admit of bestowing upon
                     it such a notice as it really deserves.</p>

                  <p>This work is a collection of miscellaneous sketches on the Romance of
                     Agriculture and Rural Life. Matters of fact, however, are not excluded from the
                     volume, which is well adapted for reading in the snatches of leisure enjoyed at
                     the farmer's fireside.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Blake's publications are all of a high order, and are doing a most
                     important work towards refining the taste, improving the intellect, and<pb
                        n="316-317 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6562-00000169"/> rendering
                     attractive the various branches of Agricultural science. Indeed we know no
                     author who has so successfully blended the romantic, the rural and beautiful
                     with the poetical, the useful, and true, as has Dr. Blake. This is a peculiar
                     feature of all his works. His style is plain, simple, and perspicuous; and,
                     with unusual tact and judgment, he so manages to insinuate himself upon you,
                     that you are at once amused, delighted, and instructed with the subject he is
                     discussing. In this respect he relieves the study of agricultural science from
                     the abstruseness of technical science, and thus renders himself easily
                     comprehended by all classes of readers.</p>

                  <p>The author's object is to improve the soil through the mind—not so much to
                     place in the hands of farmers the best methods of raising large crops—for these
                     he refers them to Leibig's Agricultural Chemistry, and to treatises of the like
                     description—but to make them feel how useful, agreeable, and ennobling, is the
                     profession of agriculture, and, above all, how profitable the business must
                     become when skilfully and economically carried on. These money-making
                     considerations are, we suspect, the best moral guano that can be applied to the
                     farmer's spiritual soil. The author writes well of the countryman's
                     independence, the good effect of fresh salubrious air upon his health, and the
                     moral influence of his every-day intimacy with nature upon his mind.</p>
                  <p>"The Farm and the Fireside" is a kind of Bucolical annual—to be read in seasons
                     of leisure—intended for the Phyllises and Chloes, as well as for the Strephons
                     and Lindors. Dr. Blake has enriched it with curious anecdotes of domestic
                     animals, and of the best way of raising and selling them. He describes
                     model-farms, and the large incomes made from them. He expatiates on the
                     advantages of matrimony in rural life, expounds the true theory of choosing a
                     helpmate, discusses the advantages of Sunday-Schools, and recommends neatness
                     of attire and punctuality in bathing. In short, this volume is as diversified
                     in its aspect as the small garden of a judicious cultivator, where, in a
                     limited space, useful cabbages, potatoes, and all the solid esculent greens,
                     grow side by side with choice fruits and pleasant flowers.</p>

               <p>COUSIN CICELY is very industrious—whether in penciling lights or shadows, in
                  describing domestic scenery, or inculcating religious principles, the fair author
                  possesses a happy facility, so as to render her productions alike agreeable and
                     instructive.—<title>Protestant Churchman.</title>
               </p>
               <p>This book is written in a style well calculated to please, and contains an
                  inestimable moral—plain, concise, and void of superfluities, that a child may
                  understand it—characters life-like and well sustained, and the whole plan of the
                  work is good.—<title>Yales Co Whig.</title>

               </p>
               <p>The story is not only well written, but it has merits in the dramatic grouping of
                  incidents, graphic delineation of character, and the affecting interest which
                  attracts and supports the reader's attention through the whole work, from the
                  opening scene to the finale.—<title>Rochester Daily Democrat.</title>
               </p>
               <p>This is a new work from the pen of the gifted author of the "Silver Lake Stories."
                  It is got up in a style of mechanical elegance equal to the issues of Putnam and
                  Appleton, and the quality of its contents will not be found behind that of
                  three-fourths of the publications that emanate from the pens of more wide-known
                  authors, and from publishing houses that employ none but the <emph>best
                     writers</emph>.—<title>Canandaigua Messenger.</title>
               </p>
               <p>It is a story designed to illustrate the deplorable effects of a neglect of proper
                  parental discipline in infancy; in a well-written preface, the authoress, "Cousin
                  Cicely," assures us it is substantially a narrative of facts. It traces the career
                  of a spoiled and petted boy, whose mother was too weak and indolent to restrain
                  him as she ought, through the several stages of a perverse childhood, a reckless
                  boyhood, and a passionate, ungovernable youth, till this victim of a parent's
                  folly is found in a felon's cell, with the mark of Cain on his brow.—<title>Auburn
                     Daily Advertiser.</title>
               </p>
               <p>The authoress, who, by the way, need not be afraid to sail under her own proper
                  colors hereafter, claims that most of the incidents are taken from real life; a
                  very creditable averment, as the work, with slight modifications in each
                  individual case, would prove a faithful portraiture of the early training and
                  subsequent career of nine-tenths of the victims of the gallows, and of the
                     penitentiary.—<title>Mirror, Lyons, N. Y.</title>
               </p>
               <p>The writer of this, and of many other pleasant volumes—"Cousin Cicely," as she
                  chooses to be called—is gifted with rare talents, which she is wisely devoting to
                  useful ends. Her charming "Silver Lake Stories," have effected much good, and this
                  work is well calculated to do the same, both with children of the larger and of
                  the smaller growth. Difficulties of various natures arise, on the last and most
                  important of which hangs the catastrophe of the story. But what that is, and how
                  the book ends, is for the reader to find out, not for us to tell.—<title>Albany
                     Eve Journal.</title>
               </p>
               <p>One of the domestic sort—speaking of home, dwelling upon home affections and
                  family character, and the incidents of common life, yet as deeply interesting as
                  the most romantic narrative. It has not been paraded before the public with
                  ostentatious praise; but it will be far more acceptable to the reader than many
                  works that have thus attracted interest in advance, without being able to meet and
                  repay it.—<title>Albany Atlas.</title>
