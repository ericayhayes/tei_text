A. loud shout of victory, went up from the company-as they&#xD;

They turned their carriage on the river bank and their faced&#xD;

CHAPTER V*&#xD;
TE MISER ANwD HIS Vif --TE       DEMAND--THE JEW'S PER.&#xD;
PLEXITY--sTRANGER.&#xD;
ON a dark and rainy night in September, Abel Grimps absorb-&#xD;
ed inspeculative reflection, sat in his house alone save the com'&#xD;
pany of his faithful masti' Carlo,' who, as his master had just&#xD;
been partaking of a hasty repast, looked up into his face as if&#xD;
begging a morsel to eat. .&#xD;
'Ah Carlo! poor Carlo!' you are two gluttonous ; your mas-&#xD;
ter has lost too much motley lately to afford you a sumptuous lv-&#xD;
ing,' muttered the miser y Jew as if addressing the dog, who,&#xD;
while the old man spoke arose and approached the side of his&#xD;
master.&#xD;
Suddenly the dog pribked his ears and turned towards the&#xD;
front door, when the three peculiar raps was heard. The miser&#xD;
started from his revery and muttered half aloud, 'it is he;' He&#xD;
opened the door and Orson Dudley stepped in saying,&#xD;
. 'Well Seigle not dead ret, eh?'&#xD;
A quick tremor passed over the miser as he strangely shudder-&#xD;
ed at the words. But as quickly collecting hmself, he passed it&#xD;
off and requested the intlder to open his buteness*.&#xD;
'What is your wish, sir ? required the Jew with a business&#xD;
like air.&#xD;
'i wish money,' was the brief reply.-&#xD;
' I am Poor ' pleaded Seigle. 'I have been robbed of some&#xD;
twenty thousanddollars.'&#xD;
'Ah,' said Dudley car essy, 'If then you have such a sum&#xD;
far burglars. you certainl have some for me. Countme out one&#xD;
thousand'&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
*I do not possess such a sum' replied Grimps with a rueful&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"Procure it then.&#xD;
'I cannot.'&#xD;
'Tis false,' cried Dudley warmly.  'You are deceiving me -&#xD;
the story of your robbery I believe to be a hoax-let me have&#xD;
the money or I'll use my power.'&#xD;
'Call to-morrow,' answered the terrified~Jew, 'and I will pay&#xD;
you all you demand.'&#xD;
'.Caleb Seigle, listenn' said Dudley with emotion, ere the ex-&#xD;
piration of three months from the present, I must have those&#xD;
children-or by heavens, you shall forfeit your worthless life on&#xD;
the scoaffld.'&#xD;
The next day, Dudley called at the office of Grimps'and re-&#xD;
ceived the desired sum of money, and again admonishing the mur-&#xD;
derer to be prepared to comply with his request; left 1inmte his&#xD;
reflections.&#xD;
The following day, clear and -beautiful, Abel Grimps started&#xD;
for New-York in search of the girl whom he had sent to his cousin&#xD;
but whom she had left a short time after.&#xD;
Well Caleb, what brings you so hasty to our city new?' en-&#xD;
quired his cousin of him as he entered her presence. 'I came&#xD;
to see about Radhael,' he replied, 'I wish to obtainx some. clue&#xD;
to her whereabouts.'&#xD;
'Why did she leave your root?'&#xD;
'I scarcely canitell, but she grew quite uncontrollable and self-&#xD;
willed, and I was unable to do anything with her.&#xD;
Itahael had also left his cousins, and being unable to obtain&#xD;
any information in regard to her,he was in despair. A disgrace-&#xD;
ful death stared him in the face, but seeing no hope heat length&#xD;
resolved to meet his fate witha firm heart.&#xD;
He returned to Philadelphia-end was once more sitting in his&#xD;
solitary room, as the cloak struck eight-it was evening. A low&#xD;
knock aroused him. tie arose, and admitted a young mans ofa&#xD;
handsome delicate countenance, his person clad in a suit of dark&#xD;
apparel quite shabby. He was an entire stranger toGrimps.&#xD;

&#xD;
He accepted a proffered seat, and for a moment without saying&#xD;
a single word fixed his eyes on the Jew..&#xD;
What is your business with me, sir?' Grimps at length made&#xD;
out, in a polite manner to inquire.&#xD;

'Yes-what do you wish In my lie?'&#xD;
Money;' tasthe brief reply.&#xD;
'Well what have you to give in exchange?' interrogatedthe&#xD;
Jewish pawnbroker with  susi&#xD;
'Information,' was the echoed answer.&#xD;

YARD.&#xD;
MYarh BLAKELY the miser's ward has grown u      woman"&#xD;
hood,, lovely and:beautifil. Tall, and even majestic n  guer&#xD;
she seemed to partake of all the stateliness and Spanish beauty:&#xD;
of her mother,'and yet, her large flashing black eyes, long jet&#xD;
glossy insl to and a nose partaking somewhat of the acquihne,&#xD;
reminded the beholder as she passed, of the ardent voluptery of&#xD;
the 'Beautiful Jewess.'&#xD;
While yet quite young, she found her way tothec dress circle&#xD;
of the theatre, and being possessed of a warm poetic nature and&#xD;
love of the beautiful in the tragic art, she soon acquired an aU&#xD;
absorbingstaste for the drama. And this her. ruling tempera-&#xD;
ment or passion, found expression in her very carriage, noton ly&#xD;
at home but more especially on tie street. Her walk, inspirited&#xD;
by frequent stage exhibitions was most graceful, stately and ma-&#xD;
jestic. Her carriage:on the promenade was equal in ease and&#xD;
graceto that of the most polished and accomplished Queen. At&#xD;
home, in her room, she'frequently gave speech to her poetic soul&#xD;
in the dramatic la ag eof Shakspeare, or some other favorite&#xD;
author whom she closelyy studied.&#xD;
Myria, though but the;humble milliner girl,: possessed alaurge&#xD;
circle of admirers for her spirited disposition and beauty. And&#xD;
though lovely, yet she was not. perfection. She was proud;and&#xD;
had already experienced the first pangs of mortaljealousy . the&#xD;
dashing Chesnut-street hatter, Chaeles-Orsay; orthe 'count' as&#xD;
he was jovially called, had received his ' travelling card' from&#xD;
her, and she had sunk down upon the sofa where hieleft her at'&#xD;
their last interview, sweeping in the bitterest disappointment.&#xD;
But his-place in her regard was soon filled by one whom she&#xD;
early learned to love with greater ardor and trust. Milford Sef-&#xD;
ton M. D., a professional, seemedamore congenial in his atten-&#xD;
tions to her pride of life and love of position. The endearing&#xD;
prospe9t of becoming the wife of a piysieian, and one two of&#xD;
Milford Sefton's position in the profession, fed her soul with a&#xD;
peculiar, overpowering charm.&#xD;
But her eager progress in love, incidents of trial, and cross&#xD;
purposes, we cannot recount here.  on&#xD;
After  a season of specious promises of fidelity and ardent vows&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.&#xD;
of love and honor, she was deceived and basely deserted by him.&#xD;
For this, after a shott period of agony, remorse and shame, she,&#xD;
in her chamber alone, with none to witness or hear it save Jehovah,&#xD;
made a solemn vow of direst revenge.&#xD;
She purchased a handsome knife, and ever after bore it about&#xD;
her concealed.&#xD;
Several times she encountered him in company, but was foiled&#xD;
in her design upon her betrayer. We have already hinted at&#xD;
her natural taste and qualifications foi-the drama. She was gifted&#xD;
indeed with mind, feature and form, power of declaration and a&#xD;
voice to appear on the public stage .with the most splendid effect.&#xD;
And it was about this period; in her life, that, nerved by own,&#xD;
proud spirit and the advice of friends, she concluded to test her&#xD;
abilities in the tragic muse. Need we say her choice was a happy&#xD;
one. With a keen sense of her late wrongs, backed up with the&#xD;
most sacred obligation of revenge, her acting was spirited and&#xD;
earnest, her reading eloquent and vivid, while her speaking eyes&#xD;
and animated features flashed, the magnetic fires as the only spirit&#xD;
of the part she had chosen burned in her soul.&#xD;
She was,'successful, triumphant, and-the dome of -the theatre&#xD;
echoed and re-echoed with applause as flowers and numberless&#xD;
boquetts greeted her brilliant and happy debut.&#xD;
'BeautifuI--splendid:' The speaker was Clarence Clinton the&#xD;
machanic author.&#xD;
'She's a trump, an no mistake-' said Ringgold.&#xD;
' Such rich flowing-hair, and those eyes, and her bust so di-&#xD;
vinely moulded. It would make an angel sin,' said Franks.&#xD;
'How full of life and power her swelling bosom seems, and her&#xD;
voice-how musical and clear-such control in one so youn.&#xD;
and unpracticed.  She speaks most charmingly,' continue&#xD;
Clinton.&#xD;
'She's a splendid girl. What a shame it it she's been so mis-&#xD;
fortunate. ()that d-d doctor, if I could only get hands on him&#xD;
I'de choke and twist him 'til he couldn't move, the villian, it's a&#xD;
sin, it is to wrong such a girl,' said old Job Clawson, wiping his&#xD;
tear moistened eye.&#xD;
"She's a regular brick. There's none can take her down,'&#xD;
joined:Ringgold in his own blunt manner. 'Old Sefton,' he con-&#xD;
tinued, ' by the broad stripes and bright stars of the American&#xD;
flag, if I ever spring him 'luff, he'll think all h-ll's let loose&#xD;
about his ears. I tell ye Clawson, I believe Myria will be reveng-&#xD;
ed yet.'&#xD;
Myria- knew nothing of this sympathy expressed so bluntly&#xD;
in her behalf by her friends of the William Penn Hose company,&#xD;

but she was now making sure and rapid strides up the hill of dra-&#xD;
matic fame, and'by herstirring eloquence wearing laurel wreaths&#xD;
as aAiadem of merit upon her snowy  brew, At length she ap-&#xD;
pearddin'the last act of the st irriiig tragedy.' A  long white&#xD;
robe encircled her figure ; her face, though flushed; with passion.&#xD;
seemed like marble:nflxed so firmlyiher purpose. of revenge,&#xD;
her'.hair- long tig tangled, hung down=over, her shoulders and&#xD;
breast in wild di ctder hile her glaing eyes dilated and shone&#xD;
with a brilliancy fearful to see. In'her hand-she clutched alarge&#xD;
knife, which'tlitered in the light like burnished silver. It was&#xD;
a scene in the lays The pieie concluded, the dark curtain roll-&#xD;
ed slowly dlown, nd as it reached the floor, Myria was loudly&#xD;
called for, the greatest confusion prevailed for several minutes,&#xD;
in the midst of whichand without changing her attire Myria dart-&#xD;
ed froin the plaoe, and fled wildly, frantically for home. .A.ll&#xD;
reason seemed.to' have left her, she was mad, and she sped&#xD;
through the streets at mid night swift as 'the mountain courser,&#xD;
waving and flourishing the fearful knife and - yelling in frantic&#xD;
tones, 'Revenge, revenge.  Milford, where art thou?  Villian,&#xD;
come forth and let blood justify thy wrongs.  Come-come thou&#xD;
villian, let thy victim drink thy blood.'&#xD;
On she sped, and on 'til she passed the lower boundries of&#xD;
Kensington, and crossed Cohocksink creek, when an alarm of&#xD;
fire was suddenly rung by a number of the up town bells, and-soon&#xD;
the shrill and boisterous cry of 'Fire--fire,' was added to My-&#xD;
ria's wild cry of revenge, and anon the tread of many feet, rat-&#xD;
tling of wheels, blowing of horns, rolling of the Hose, rushing on&#xD;
of the water, men, women and children jostling against each&#xD;
other, and the constant ringing of bells, made up a scene which&#xD;
for confusion and noise we cannot begin to describe.&#xD;
Myriad dashed on and on past her home, still crying.loudly for&#xD;
revengee.' She fled away from the gathering tumult about the&#xD;
fire with apparent fright, swift as her feet would carry her. On&#xD;
she fled out-Beach street to Hanover, out Hanover to the grav'&#xD;
ard.  The gate was left open, she passed rapidly in.  She es-&#xD;
a dark figure far across the place of graves.  She was fright-&#xD;
ful now tbbhold... Her stage dress thrown in confusion, her'&#xD;
hair dishevelled and floating about her shoulders in wildest disorder.&#xD;
She dashed over the graves towards the dark object before her,&#xD;
and again rang outon-the midnight silence fearfully, the language&#xD;
of her pursuit.&#xD;
Milford, where art thou-thou villain come forth--confront.&#xD;
the victim of thy perdy--come, blood for blood, base one, re-&#xD;
venge, revenge is sweet.' She flourished her dread knife abov-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.                81&#xD;
her head, and dashed over the graves direct for Sefton.&#xD;
He heard her voice, and turning quick saw her coming. For an&#xD;
instant he was parallyzedl with fear, he seemed like a statue of&#xD;
black marble, while she all life appeared in her white robes, as&#xD;
if just arisen from the dead armed with the power of Hadees, to&#xD;
revenge her own and the wrongs of. those whose graves he was&#xD;
now rifling.&#xD;
He saw, even in the darkness the subtle fire of her eyes, and&#xD;
as with a maniac yell she dashed upon him, he seized a spade and&#xD;
threw it up i defence. It saved him, for with the blow aimed&#xD;
at his breast her knife struck the flat side of the spade and broke.&#xD;
in the middle. With the dead snap of the steel blade, a single&#xD;
faint spark of reason seemed to impress the accident upon her,&#xD;
and she fell heavily against him; the force with which she struck&#xD;
carrying them to the ground. She struggled for his throat but&#xD;
securing one of her wrists in his grasp he managed to hold her&#xD;
until he gained his feet, but he had to drag her with him.&#xD;
My God, Myria, what mean you by this ?' he stammered for&#xD;
he was indeed frightened.&#xD;
' Revenge,' she fairly screamed ; 'revenge for lost honor--re..&#xD;
venge for your base falseness--revenge for your deceit,' and she&#xD;
again attempted to sink her fingers into his throat. She was&#xD;
frantic now--and again bore him to the earth by main strength,&#xD;
and tossed him about like a toy in the grasp of a giant. It was&#xD;
a fearful struggle or the mastery. Sefton groaning with very&#xD;
fear, and Myria clothed with the desperate strength of madness&#xD;
foaming at the mouth and slashing her dishevelled hair across his&#xD;
wounded face, striving to bite and besmear him with foam. The&#xD;
struggle though severe, was not long, for with a terrific sudden&#xD;
yell of triumph, as if a new thought struck her, she tossed him&#xD;
over a grave, but he still clung to her and they both rolled and&#xD;
fell to the bottom of an unclosed grave together. Sefton's ac-&#xD;
complice in robbing the dead, had just managed-to raise himself&#xD;
from the grave, and fled from the place in alarm.&#xD;
And now the mad actress and 'the M. D., struggled in a very&#xD;
narrow space, a limited compass.&#xD;
As they fell on the-coffin, it crushed beneath their weight, and&#xD;
the dead, as if started suddenly into new life rose up betwixt&#xD;
them, shaking his death clammy locks in Myria's face, antnini:&#xD;
ing his-hair with hers. To Sefton; who was acquainted with all&#xD;
temysteries, of' the dissecting room, this was nothing; ,but- to&#xD;
Myria even though a maniacs ,  wasan        n&#xD;
gle, and she sank with a subdued cry of despair beneath the power&#xD;
of her .betrayer and the dead.&#xD;

82                TIlE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.&#xD;
Ana now Sefton began to look about for- some way of egress&#xD;
from the damp grave. He did not fancy being buried thus alive,&#xD;
and seeing no way by which to raise himself from the place, he&#xD;
commenced calling loudly for help. Wgs he heard ? Not by the&#xD;
sexton, for he was sound asleep in his cabin. But a small com-&#xD;
pany of the Buck Darts passing near there from the fire heard&#xD;
him, and as soon as he caught the sound, Ringgold ever ready&#xD;
foradventure, dashed into the grave yard followed at a short dis-&#xD;
tance by his comrades, who didn't half like the gloomy place.&#xD;
Led by the sound of Sefton's voice, Ringgold soon gained the&#xD;
open grave and looking down, he exclaimed, 'Ye Gods, boys,&#xD;
we've got em now, couple of them ' Ressurrectionists--ha, ha-&#xD;
they're in a putty fix. Ha, ha, caught at last-come here to rob&#xD;
the dead did ye, and he pulled ye in, ha, ha. Serves ye right&#xD;
ye old body snatcher.' Ringgold stooped down and attempted&#xD;
to look through the darkness into the grave. He put down his&#xD;
hand and called on the one below to- take it and he would help&#xD;
him out. But he soon found he could not reach him in that way.&#xD;
' Hold on,' said he getting up on his feet again, "till I get&#xD;
something to put down to ye.' He turned to go towards the&#xD;
tool house in one corner of the grave yard as his feet caught in&#xD;
something. ' Halloo, what's this ?' said he as he stooped down&#xD;
and found it to be a rope several yards in length. 'Ah, this'll&#xD;
fetch ye up, or I'm not Jack Ringgold. Here old fellow-Gods&#xD;
boys, may be its the old sexton met with an accident-got tight,&#xD;
or something of the sort and got down there and couldn't find&#xD;
his way out. IIalloo,.there, old boy, take hold of this and we'll&#xD;
haul you out of that hole. Take a good hold now and hold on,&#xD;
like-halloo, slippery ,about here, like to fell in myself. Boys&#xD;
get behind me and pull on the rope-halloo there, ye got a good&#xD;
hold?'                             ..      ,.&#xD;
'Yes-for God's sake get me out of this, and-' said a smooth-&#xD;
ered voice below.&#xD;
'Now boys pull. A long pull, a strong pull and a pull alto.&#xD;
gether you know. Now then, out he, comes. By Jove stranger&#xD;
who are ye anyhow ?' laid Ringgold as Sefton, almost exhausted,&#xD;
gained the top of the grave and leaping out, fell-headlong over&#xD;
another. Just at this moment, Myria havng somewhat recover-&#xD;
ed, uttered such an unearthly scream that all, even the daring&#xD;
Ringgold, started to their feet and .were leaving in haste. Sef-&#xD;
ton taking advantage of this   y hastily gathered himself up and&#xD;
fled from the grave yrd with the celerity of thought.&#xD;
Ringgold reooveriig from the terrible shock which Myria's&#xD;
awful scream gave him, exclaimed,'&#xD;
&#xD;
TR  JREMAN'S BRIDE.                 38&#xD;
- My 'God, boys, there's a gal in that hole yet. I tell ye there's&#xD;
some mystery here, for what's a living woman doing in a grave.&#xD;
Gods her scream made me think of the 'screeching woman' we&#xD;
used to hear so much talk about. It's round this rae yan t&#xD;
she used to walk and give them awful screams which frightened&#xD;
people so-'&#xD;
'Come on Ringgold let's leave here,' said Yeager Ford.&#xD;
'May be its her-who knows?' said Franks, as he trembled&#xD;
and turned with Ford to leave.&#xD;
' Ha, ha, may-be it's her, why ye fools she's dead long a.go&#xD;
afraid of a dead woman Hold ye cowards, and come and help&#xD;
the'living. That woman screamed, there's life in her yet, and&#xD;
there's something wrong here-where's the feller'? By Jove he's&#xD;
gone. Come on now help get this swomartut. W-h-e-w !-there&#xD;
she goes again, what a-voice though; enough to raise the dead&#xD;
out of their graves,' echoed Ring old with surprise.&#xD;
'I tell ye Jack, I believe it's that screeching woman got about&#xD;
again. Let her be or she'll pull ye in the grave with her-come&#xD;
away afore she's out after us,' said Franks trembling like an&#xD;
aspen.&#xD;
Several of the company stood with Franks' and Ford at a dis-&#xD;
tance, but as Ringgold after upbraiding their cowardice again&#xD;
drew nearer the edge of the grave and called to the one below,&#xD;
they plucked up courage and gathered around.&#xD;
' OGod ! men help me out of this place. I'm a living woman&#xD;
and there's a corpse down here with me---for God's sake get me&#xD;
out of here.'&#xD;
.' Who are you, and how did you come where you are9' ques-&#xD;
tioned Ringgold boldly.&#xD;
'Oh assist me from this horrible place and I will tell you.'&#xD;
' Come on boys, where's the rope ? Let's get the woman out&#xD;
anyhow.'&#xD;
' Jack, we'll be in an ugly scrape here yet,' said Franks as he&#xD;
reached Ringgold the rope.&#xD;
'Fool, come help her out from the dead; she's a living woman.&#xD;
It won't do to let her' die here.'&#xD;
Myria having quite recovered, seized the rope as it ap-&#xD;
proached her with the grip of the drowning. She held on ten-&#xD;
aeiously and was soon again on terra firma. As she appeared&#xD;
at the top of the grave she looked even :more frightful than&#xD;
before. Her white torn robe wiled with the yellowloam of the&#xD;
grave, her hair all matted and blowing around her!head in knot-&#xD;
ed masses, her face ghastly and pale as the lilly. At sight of&#xD;
her, all save Ringgold, fled fromu theplace in frenzied fright, and&#xD;

having it drawn up by an attorney. But on second thought,&#xD;
notwithstanding -hislate repentance ; he  onchled to save the&#xD;
expence a lawyer would exact, and write it out himself.&#xD;
Procuring pen ink and parchment hesat down toit, read it off&#xD;
to himself as follows,&#xD;
'The last will and t± talent of CalebSeigle. Anno Domens&#xD;
185-.. In the name of;the God of Abrahaum Isaad and Jacob,&#xD;
Ainen.--I, Caleb Seigle- give and bequeath in this my last will&#xD;
and testament, to MyngBlakely, the unm of five thousand dollars&#xD;
in cash, and one three itory brick house, and the lot situate upon&#xD;
Sixth-street, No. --.-, also one three story brick houseNo.----&#xD;
Oallowhill street. 4 give and bequeath to Charles lakely, five&#xD;
thousand dollars in=money, and the three story brick houses in&#xD;
Race.street, N6's.-.----and---...-. I give and bequeath to my&#xD;
cousin Rebecca Speigle the sum of ten thousand dollars, and th e&#xD;
two story brick house in Seventh-street, No. --, being the one&#xD;
in which I now live. Amuong my. possessions there is a small seal-&#xD;
ed packet containingvaluables ; it, and its contents I bequeath to&#xD;
Charles Blakely, brother of Myria-'&#xD;
This closed the brief yet compr e~ ensin~i~ and last testament&#xD;
of Caleb Seigle, alias Abel Grimps. As he pondered over it he&#xD;
mused to himself thus, as aheavy sigh escaped him,&#xD;
'tThere, that duty is discharged, and its burden removed from&#xD;
my soul. Accursed gold---how iteats ito one' peace, and yet&#xD;
what ajoy its freerestoration gives. So many, many. years ac-&#xD;
cumulating this, and now to part with it so suddenly. 'Tis not&#xD;
without a pang-yet let it go-the God of Abraham forgive rme.&#xD;
He raised his eyes above as in prayer, and folding up the parch-&#xD;
went carefully deposited it with the packet into his 'iron chest,'&#xD;
and locked it there.&#xD;
Several days have passed, and quite a change has come over&#xD;
the repentant Miser, he now appears neatly attired in a suit of&#xD;
black, his grey locks combed out and his face smoothly shaved&#xD;
and clean, he seems happy ; Carlo, his faithful old mastiff lies at&#xD;
his feet, while the converted Jew is lost in a pleasant revery.&#xD;
'Now em I hppy,'seems to arise fromhis soul spontaneously.&#xD;
phis crushing weight of guilt:beneath whicthI have labored .so&#xD;
long, is at last removed. 0 bless the God ofhJacob, wih him there&#xD;
is mercy; and plenteous redemption.- Oh whathave I not suffered,&#xD;

what dreamy restless nights of terror have I passed. But God&#xD;
is good, and righteous and just in all his ways.' The clock struck&#xD;
ten, and the sound had scarcely died aw whehe&#xD;
same mysterious racing               way    en   heard the&#xD;
He could scarce  suppress a rising shudder ;as he thoeht of&#xD;
the terror it once caused hinbutteg&#xD;
' That sound terrifies me no longer now,' he whispered hoarsely.&#xD;
I can now confront him with aheart at ease-.and conscience c-&#xD;
posed.'                            esa      osinecm&#xD;
He opened the door, and Orson Dudley entered.&#xD;
'Well Seigle,' said he, 'you see I keep my promise.&#xD;
'Yes sir, I see you do, and I amhappy to meet you thus&#xD;
again-'&#xD;
'Ah !' responded the other as he :aught at a glance the ex&#xD;
pression of placid calmness in the old man's face.&#xD;
'Does it surprise you, Orson Blakely?' the Jew asked in'a&#xD;
pleasant manner.&#xD;
'Orson Blakely' ejaculated the other changing color. ' What&#xD;
mean you sir by that?  My name is.Orson Dudley.'&#xD;
'Well it may be so--yet 1 am almost persuaded that youpos.&#xD;
sess two names.p&#xD;
'How so?'&#xD;
'Don't mind it at present. But open your business with me,&#xD;
for I am now quite prepared for whatever you request.&#xD;
'Then.where are the children ?' asked Dudley with a quiver-&#xD;
ing lip.&#xD;
'In the city,' replied the Jew.&#xD;
'Now is this true, or is it a subterfuge invented to escape my&#xD;
vengeance?' demanded Dudley.&#xD;
'It is the truth, for I expect them here with me this very night,&#xD;
and if you will remain you may once more embrace your children.'&#xD;
'My children, how mean you?' cried Dudley.&#xD;
'What is your name ?'&#xD;
'Orson Dudley.'&#xD;
'But you still deceive me,' replied the old man.&#xD;
'Deo I?'&#xD;
'Yes sir, for I have every reason to believe that you are the&#xD;
identical person whom sixteen years ago, I attempted to-.'&#xD;
' llah-you know me then. How have you contrived to   ain&#xD;
this knowledge-7-for Blakely is my name.'&#xD;
While Seigle is engaged in rendering the desired information,&#xD;
we must hasten to give a scone occuring at the same moment in&#xD;
another part of the city.&#xD;
Myria Blakely sat in her home on Beach street. She was&#xD;

THE PIREXAI'S BRIDE.              89&#xD;
&#xD;
88                 THE, FInzugS BRIDE-&#xD;
waiting with impatient :expectation for one with whom she had&#xD;
already passed several happy interviews.&#xD;
harles Morgan was scarce two years her junior, handsogne&#xD;
and witty. He first snet MyrIa in public at a Fireman's ball,&#xD;
given by the Wiliam   Penn Hose Company; was introduced,&#xD;
aneed several sets with her, and escorted her home.&#xD;
'Ohshow my heart, throbs as the hour approaches,' she ir-&#xD;
inured gently to hersel; glancinat the clock.  ' Why is it that&#xD;
IVrealize suckr a'strange interest in him?  From the hour I first&#xD;
saw his noble and lovely face, I have loved him. And once --how&#xD;
strange, I immaginedL him my long lost brother--but , this can-&#xD;
nt be-'&#xD;
Aring at the door bell annonced his arrival. She quickly&#xD;
arose and admitted him. As he entered, a succession of blushes&#xD;
mounted her cheeks, and as he placed his hand.in hers', he gaily&#xD;
said,;&#xD;
'Good evening MIyria. I am glad to see you looking so well.'&#xD;
'0 Charles, how glad I am you've come. But you must cease&#xD;
your constant flattery of my looks, or I know not what I shall&#xD;
do with you.'&#xD;
I almost said return the compliment, but in this case, that&#xD;
would be unfair, more indeed than I could bear.'&#xD;
' Ahem, why keep on Charley and you'll soon be a poet. that&#xD;
wil do, you may dpen on it. -But, by the way, is your rea&#xD;
name Charles Morg  .'&#xD;
'Ha; ha, why what in the world are you driving at now?&#xD;
' Never mind, but answer me if you.please ?'&#xD;
' That is a singular question. Well I have never knownany&#xD;
other.'&#xD;
'Do your parents reside in the city?'&#xD;
'W6l welll Myria, what nean you, at any'rate, by this date-&#xD;
chisigh'&#xD;
His countenance fell, and a sudden twitch passed o-ve bi row&#xD;
as he answered,&#xD;
'Alas! I have never known my parents.'&#xD;
'Indeed,' exclaimed Myria. surprised ; 'have you sisters or&#xD;
brothers?'&#xD;
"Xad: a sister, a sweet little:girl-,hen last4 saw her ; but we&#xD;
were separated by our ;dzardianwhen quite' young, and I have&#xD;
never looked upon her since.'&#xD;
"Tis hard--but how long have you known Milford Sefton'&#xD;
The physician ?&#xD;
TYes.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'$ome four years.'&#xD;
9 But this does not explain what I wish-have *e ever met be-&#xD;
fore? I mean ere we met in this .ity'&#xD;
'Net to my' reclleetid. 'These questions are strange, and&#xD;
yet when I first saw you Myria, it seemed as though we had :met&#xD;
before.'&#xD;
He now turned and gazed upon her features; as ie had never&#xD;
looked before, and seemed to drink their very impress upon his&#xD;
soul.&#xD;
'Explain this mystery,', he exclaimed in embarassment. Both&#xD;
starting to their feet, their glinces met, and their features side&#xD;
and side were reflected to each other in the large Spanish mir-&#xD;
ror which stood before them, stretching from the ceiling to the&#xD;
floor.&#xD;
' 0 my sister !' he exclaimed with affection and unspeakable&#xD;
emotion.&#xD;
eOh Charles, is it possible. Can it be thou art indeed my long&#xD;
lost brother-Charles=--'&#xD;
For several minutes the sudden discovery held them in each&#xD;
others embrace speechless.&#xD;
Myria wept with unspeakable joy, satisfied now fully that&#xD;
Charles Morgan was indeed her long absent brother.&#xD;
After the lapse of several minutes and Myria had become caber,&#xD;
she queried of her brother,&#xD;
But our old guardian, Caleb Seigle, do you ever see  hi&#xD;
Charles?'&#xD;
'The old Jew miser ?-Call him not guardian Myria. See him&#xD;
-no, I never do; though latterly I have heard of him some.&#xD;
Why sister do you ask, think he yet feels an interest in uS ,I'&#xD;
'He wished us to see him at his house to-night. He said he&#xD;
would introduce us to our father.'&#xD;
' Father ! Did you ever see father, Myria&#xD;
'Yes, but I can scarcely recollect him it.has been so long.'&#xD;
' 0 I should be happy to seem. The very name soindu so&#xD;
dear to me.'&#xD;
'Shall we visit the Jew?'&#xD;
' Myira, my sister, I despise the old:miser as much as I fear&#xD;
him. Think you he does not mean to entrap us for some vile&#xD;
purpose ?&#xD;
' 0 Charles, the thoughtmakes me shudder. I did not think&#xD;
of that before&#xD;
'Iwould not trust him. Though the fact is Myria, I believe&#xD;
he knows more of our parents, than would be safe for him to i-&#xD;

Jason Booth, the gardeners-had often thought of offering him-&#xD;

But the heart of the widow was devoted singly and solely and&#xD;
forverto her firstdlove  And -her noble -reply to her Scotch&#xD;
ardener's prayer was; 'None can ever fill the place left vacant&#xD;
-y lost one atsea. Ris place shallnever be filled by another.'&#xD;
She was right, for the Scotchman's motives weremercenerp.&#xD;
It was not her, but her money he loved.  His companionship&#xD;
thus refused4se decidedly, and thwarted in his object of grasping&#xD;
her property, hesoon thought of another way to get the widow's&#xD;

to the spring. She succeeded by great caution and care to bury&#xD;
it therewithout being seen. The Scotebman'seecond plan, by&#xD;
which tosecure her riches, waS to murder her.&#xD;
It was atthe Closy of the day in early spring, and there were&#xD;
none about the.place save the widow and Jason; lie was yet in&#xD;
the garden about to leaveshis work for tire day, when he espied&#xD;
her as she cast a white garment about her:shoulders, enter-the&#xD;
path, and walk slowly down toward:the running: spring. He&#xD;
stealthly watched her throughM some rose bushes and sweet briar&#xD;
which intertwined between them until she reached the edge of&#xD;
the orbe. He saw her stand upou the large fiat stone and then&#xD;
glance around her. Still he knew not that= she had her money&#xD;
there  She stooped down and k  darted from the garden-un-&#xD;

glad to find a spot where we could Spend an houralone. Suffice&#xD;
that before we separated that night,  had gained her promise to&#xD;

he added with a langh. 'Come tune your pipes boys and join in.&#xD;

Clawson was 'called on to Efnish 'his story. lie continued with a&#xD;

'It was lhte whenie 'left the ire for home, 'the very witching&#xD;
time of night'--as Shatespeareh as it--'when grave yards yawn,&#xD;
&amp;amp;c.,' and as we were passing slowl along by the grave yard on&#xD;
Hanover street; I was at the' head of'the rope, and looking up,&#xD;
I saw through the darkness a short distance to the.,left of me,&#xD;
something white as the driven snow, coming on towards the very,&#xD;
edge of the gutter at a measured steady pace. ,I peered through&#xD;
the donse darkness a moment if possible to discern what it was,&#xD;
and 'I cannot now name all tlte innumerable pictures of things&#xD;
which ' tho ghtr it was. At last, having heard of her before, I&#xD;
thought 'of the screamnig woman.'I looked again, and she was&#xD;
quite near, in fact we were approachiqg each other, She was at-&#xD;
tired as I have said, in clear white,'so white that it almost shone,&#xD;
in the darkness. In her breast 'there was a deep wound, from&#xD;
which the warm blood, of a deep purple h~ue seemed yet to flow&#xD;
Her eyes were fixed and glass and on she came udtil she stood'&#xD;
on the very corner'of the gave yard; Wheri I saw-he. s.op, a&#xD;
sudden chill 'ran through mjyveins, and my flesh began to creep&#xD;
as if grave worms were alreaygreying on my body, , hoped&#xD;
she would'pass by without seeing us, if in fact .she nold see at&#xD;
all." But she paused amonent  a just as I reached a parallel&#xD;
line with her; she o"cned her mouth and utteredd such a sharp&#xD;
&#xD;

TH. FI RnMAN'S' JRID,               47 _&#xD;
piercing scream,,so unearthly, soul chilling and terrifyitig, that&#xD;
though I had sided of from her as far as I could in passing, yet&#xD;
[felt flat in the road. 1y ,.o4,  I thought-the end of the world&#xD;
had surely come, and I wars. then -whirling through unknown re-&#xD;
gions fair beyond;the bound of time, through illimitable-space,&#xD;
never to:touch the:earth with my feet again.: I felt as.if all my&#xD;
blood, every spark of'animation hadlefo me, and 1Brae being&#xD;
tossed through space like an empty hal. : felt in truth that ay&#xD;
time had Torre, and I was absolutely nothing.&#xD;
Tho rest of the corupany:I_ believe;leftthe rope, and fled over&#xD;
the bank as if the very d--l, leading a whole legion, wasafter&#xD;
them. After their: fright subsided, and she had disappeared,&#xD;
they, or some of them returned to the deserted carriage just as&#xD;
their fallen director was gettingup out ofthe :mud.&#xD;
"Where is she, has she gone?' asked several of them as they&#xD;
tremblingly took h old of the rope again, panting for breath.-&#xD;
'My God, much as I have heard of her, I cannot stand her&#xD;
scream. Itsperfectly awfu--wnearthly.'&#xD;
We left the vicinity of the'grave yard hastily, you may depend,&#xD;
and soon housed the carriage.  Some hurried home, but others&#xD;
lingered about the hose :house, and talked and speculated about&#xD;
the Screaming woman and her apparition.&#xD;
The. screaming woman has been seen often. The men whoused&#xD;
to work at Dyott's glass works-the glass blowers, for a long&#xD;
while there was not one of them who had not met her some time.&#xD;
in the night, er early in the morning, as they were-leaving their&#xD;
work or returning. - They worked all night you know, and hone&#xD;
of them but spoke of her appearance and scream without a shud-&#xD;
der.- One by the name of Brown, and I believe is still living,&#xD;
was so frightened by her one morning just as he was in the act&#xD;
of speaking to her, that he fell. flat to the ground just as she&#xD;
knocked me. Others have attempted the same thing with a like&#xD;
fearful result.  Onuxew year's eve, three or four members of the&#xD;
'Ebenezer 'church' near the grave yard, having heard a great&#xD;
deal about her, and not believing whathde heard, determined to&#xD;
watch and convince 'themselvesof the truth of the matter -I&#xD;
believe, by the why, their pastor was with them too, and of course&#xD;
nothingfrom the other world could harm them. Suck a force&#xD;
off alyoea,.was prooa against Satan himself.&#xD;
They attended' watch meeting,' and at its clQse went out aind&#xD;
watched for-the  eamingwoinan.'&#xD;
About one oa'loci she came slowlyRand evenly along, as&#xD;
on the very edge,9of the side walk. This 'night it was nioonlight,&#xD;
and ohe being alln  whiteso dazzled their vision that theyco&#xD;

scarcely:looIksteadily on her. But, they had -determined to imako&#xD;
a clbareport of what they saw, so they continued to watch, and&#xD;
stood; cn .the corner=on the OpPodite side of -the street. On she&#xD;
came ras though she saw them,-not, and as she neared the corner&#xD;
of th gaieayard they determined to cross and speak to her, but&#xD;
just s: she stepped into the street, she uttered a- fearful shriek,&#xD;
aud they wore rooted to-the spot-struok=both .speechless-and&#xD;
motionless--according to their wiw language.   hey felt the&#xD;
hair of their heads'rise up and stiffen like quillsf and the very&#xD;
blood .in their veins grew chillyand cold.- For some minutes&#xD;
theystood thus like statues unable to ,move, but as she passed Oi&#xD;
the selinWas broke and they broke also, and-ran like{lightning&#xD;
down the Street.&#xD;
And now boys for the' explanation of her oeturnal walks, as&#xD;
given by the oldest inhabitants.;&#xD;
Old-daddf Orist, wholived so loug adjoining the grave yard,&#xD;
says :l-That this woman-when young, being very beautiful, was&#xD;
loved by a sailor who insisted upon her; wddinkahim, but she&#xD;
loved another, and of course refused the sailor's'hand.Odne even-&#xD;
ing shortly after he had returned from sea, he persuaded her to&#xD;
walkou-with himn,:and'as they9 approached the place where the&#xD;
grave yard is-a lrge field it was then--their path.passed- along&#xD;
neap a tree. An apple tree, it stood for a number of years in&#xD;
one rotneofi the grave yard.;- They stopped betieath the tree&#xD;
and he renewed-the suit for the loiely maiden's haid. SBe still&#xD;
refused to grant his- prayer, and when with heavidg-bosohl and&#xD;

Not far- from. the 'Buck Darts' room, thorglh the night was&#xD;

about the hose-house, and at last assuredthat nne'oflthe comn-&#xD;

movement after entering-the house; was to secure immoveably to&#xD;
the floor, the hose carriage ; -the next tobesmear'it with targ id&#xD;
the third movement- was to ignite several boxes of matches and&#xD;
fire the house in a number of places, particularly benestlifthi&#xD;

Scarcely had they made good their escape, than the whole&#xD;

sINGULAi DEATH.&#xD;
Wi should now perhaps turn our attention once more towards&#xD;
Myria the Mad Actress.&#xD;
We left her with her newly found brother Charles Blakely,&#xD;
alias Morgan.&#xD;
Myria's madness was by periodical, spells,. at such times when&#xD;
alone and reflectingupon the wrongs heaped upon her by the vil-&#xD;
lain Sefton, her betrayer. Then she would start up and fly from&#xD;
the house, and-run wildly through the streets in quest, as she sup.&#xD;
posed, of her vile seducer.&#xD;
But when with her brother, his' companionship seemed to prove&#xD;
a soothing balm to her troubled eand restless spirit.&#xD;
Since their first interview, sh  had recalled his mind several&#xD;
times" to her proposed visit to  aleb Seigle. And one evening&#xD;
be called upon her and introduoed'to herJack Ringgold as one&#xD;
whom he wished to accompany tem to the Jewish miser. Myria&#xD;
bowed politely, and received him kindly for her brothers sake;&#xD;
but she started as she remembered it was he Wha drew ier from&#xD;
the grave a midnight sometiigsince. They knew each other&#xD;
now, bt he kiew not, that it was her who had frightened him so&#xD;
on that occasion.: After a season of, pleasant conversation, they&#xD;
started for the home of Caleb Seigle. ' Fifteen minutes walk&#xD;
brought themr to the miser's old;tenement.&#xD;
Myria knocked at th dehr, nd after waiting a few minutes&#xD;
they wereIadinitted. As the door opened, Myria caught sight&#xD;
of the old Jew as- he sat:back, fir=hack:in his privatejrooin look-&#xD;
ing towards the opened door. Again the horrible spell of mad-&#xD;
ness was upon her, andwith aj wild; shriek she ran sand seizing&#xD;
the old man by the arms she shrieked,-&#xD;
'You said you would show remy father. lyuestore now my&#xD;
parent, to me, oiIl despatchyou to king him from the other&#xD;
world. My brother has cometo see lim also, and here is another&#xD;

JRinggold and Morgan l oked on in. mute astonishment, and&#xD;
&#xD;
T   FIREMAN'# BRIDE.              51&#xD;
the Jew trembled and turned pale beneath the.strane power and&#xD;
manner of the excited girl. Suddenly he raised his hand, and&#xD;
pointing towards the ,dor wih hadfst opened again, he ejac-&#xD;
ulated with no small'degree of reliefs-&#xD;
He has eome-'.he is there--God be praised I&#xD;
In an instant all eyes were turned towards the ta'nsy Orm&#xD;
of the new corner.&#xD;
The Jew beckoned him to approach. He did s6,  d  he en.&#xD;
countered the gazeof 1 inggold, he started spaia diiaally  and&#xD;
mggold as helokedjppeared'to recogni  an  lf  eaintance&#xD;
in the person of Orsot Didley&#xD;
=Vyria a&amp;amp;rid  harles gazed n the stranger but knew him iot.&#xD;
The Jew ws the fista to speak,&#xD;
'Myria and Charles,' said he, 'I-noweaonit in  elf of a long&#xD;
starding obligatioti nc e Iattemted toytuiI r. your father.'&#xD;
The:sister and hrother started at the bold confession, and look-&#xD;
ed at each other in doubt.&#xD;
And until a few months since,' continued the Jew, belie ed&#xD;
I had done so. .But God be praised, that parent now stands be-&#xD;
fore you.'&#xD;
D dley immediately threw off his cloak and a pair of false&#xD;
whiskera, and stood revealed in their midst, his eyes beaming&#xD;
with unspeakable affection ; and resting fondly upon his two&#xD;
children, who now in the greatest andinexpressible surprise,&#xD;
stood=side by side.&#xD;
Charles and Myria; hee±claimed approaching them with open&#xD;
armsg 'you are indeed my long lost children, look upon your f-&#xD;
ther Orson.Blakel. Sixteenyears have not diminished my loe&#xD;
and paternal affection -for you.&#xD;
Saying which he clasped each in his arns and the fond Myria&#xD;
wept again for very joy. But an attempt to describe the ecstatic&#xD;
bliss and happinessef the scene, would but detract from the jof&#xD;
ous ieots of its deep reality.&#xD;
The unefeakable joy consequent upon the reunion of the fond&#xD;
parent and his two only children, after cruel separation ot i-.&#xD;
teen years, could only be expressed in fast falling tears of heart&#xD;
felt gratitude.&#xD;
Seile gazed in silence upon the scene. It was the happiest&#xD;
lie hadever beheld.&#xD;
When each had somewhat recovered-from their joyful surprise,&#xD;
Rif old approached Orson and said,&#xD;
also with deep pleasure grasp your hand, though I have not&#xD;
seen you since that eventful ay we parted.'&#xD;

'LFalf an hour more he -lft the rooi. I listened, and thought&#xD;

were carrying something heavy. They reachedthefgrst. floor,&#xD;

Never, never, can I forgive myself for acting such a base cowardly&#xD;
part.'&#xD;
"Tspast now, and the. future is bright.'-&#xD;
Yes, I feel it is so,' returned Ringgold and continued,&#xD;
They laid him on the ground, and Seigle dug a narrow exca-&#xD;
vation some three- feet dcep--rolled the body over, until, it sank&#xD;
beneath his spade, when he partially covered it, and then 'left&#xD;
the- clar.&#xD;
a oon as the sound of their retreating footsteps had died away,&#xD;
and-all was- silent again, I stole fo my hiding place,; and as&#xD;
hastily removed the earth from the body, raised it out, and my&#xD;
next impulse was to leave and inform the authorities of the foul&#xD;
murder; when, as I turned to do so, I thought I heard a slight&#xD;
roan.    started .in terror--I listened-it 'eemed,to proceed&#xD;
from the corpse.lBending down, I placed my: hand upon his&#xD;
breast near his heart. tI felt a weak pulsation.. In hope, min-&#xD;
led with fear, I glanced and felt around the cellar, yet scarcely&#xD;
knew what for. Instinctively as it were, I drew from a cask near&#xD;
me some whiskey in my hand, and applie it to his wounds,which&#xD;
sedo bee m          a  amoistened his parched lips with it&#xD;
an bathed his face and temples. Fainting hope quickened with&#xD;
fresh impulse, and I soon realized the joyous satisfaction'of feel-&#xD;
in him move. The basement was very dark, so that I could not&#xD;
distinguish futures at all. I searched, and as the fates would&#xD;
have it, found upon the :side, of the staircasedsever l oandleoan&#xD;
some. matches.   immediatelystruck a light and soon compr-&#xD;
hn4 ed the correct state of thecase. The wounded man woro&#xD;
&#xD;
a buckskin iundergarinent, which fortunately had prevented the&#xD;
wound being deeper, and so saved liis life. The knife had en-&#xD;
tered just below the heart, and in the flesh but a couple of inches.&#xD;
With my handkerchief, I bandaged the wound, and in ten min-&#xD;
utes he opened his eyes; gazed vaguely around, but soon as he&#xD;
saw me he closed them again, and shuddered with seeii fear.&#xD;
I approached,. and lifting hjru in a sitting, hwh  et? gpot ure, inquiredof&#xD;
him,"howhe elt " He did not answer -but laid his' hand upon&#xD;
the wound. I then requested him to remain as he was until I&#xD;
returned. He nodded assent. I turned away, opened the doer&#xD;
and passed through the yard into the street, hastened home, and&#xD;
nroused a brother who had just returned frojn sea -hastily in&#xD;
formed him of the transaction, and then procuring chaise, so&#xD;
agan rachd te hus, where we found the wounded man still&#xD;
sitting where I had left. him, his eyes now quite open and clear.&#xD;
As we approached him he gaspedq.&#xD;
"Where will you take me ?"&#xD;
'I assured him that he was now with friends. We carried him&#xD;
out quietly, and unseen by any one placed him in the vehicle,&#xD;
and conveyed him to our home. In two weeks he had quite re-&#xD;
covered, and in confidence requested us not to prosecuteSeigle&#xD;
ash as   pursued by the officers of the' offended government,&#xD;
and it might probably lead to his capture, also informing us that&#xD;
Seigle had now in his possession an immense sum of his treasure&#xD;
also two children ; said I might wthteJw   digtheatsfr&#xD;
so doing I should at some day be amply rewarded for my&#xD;
trouble. He then filled a check requesting me toca   for&#xD;
him at the bank of---- ''Tis llIbrqusmmt cash it for&#xD;
hi                   s all  I have there, said he, handing&#xD;
me the check. I received it and proceeded as directed, and re-&#xD;
turned with about two thousand dollars for him; placed it in his&#xD;
hand, when he returned to me five hundred of the amount as a&#xD;
present, saying,&#xD;
"'Tisa small sum for saving my life, but this remaining&#xD;
amount is all that I have now upon which to travel to France,&#xD;
and thore maintain myself for perhaps five years. But," he&#xD;
concluded, Seigle has my fortune ; watch him well and do&#xD;
not let him suspect you, then shall he. return my wealth with&#xD;
fair interest." I declined receiving the five hundred dollars,&#xD;
but he would not take it back. Next day he took his leave of&#xD;

As the William Penn hose carriage passed Myria's home the&#xD;

Ringgold left the rope and rushed into her company, to the in-&#xD;
,xpressible surprise of all present.&#xD;

the remnents of a fine black coat; a tremendous_ ren up the&#xD;
back from the skirts to the Collar, and min s  skirt and :te"ve,&#xD;
His hat awfully laved in, and one,, the legaof his pan taoo&#xD;
torn off near the knee ; altogether he looked, even though hemy&#xD;
not have been in the Jight, as if he had roeeive4,some veryhard&#xD;
knocks.&#xD;
But why should he in such a plight rush into the presesse of&#xD;
theigirl lie loved?&#xD;
Jack was a Fireman, an active Fireman. He was proud and&#xD;
pleased to serve, in the noble hearted Fireman's capacity, any&#xD;
who might be distressed, and he was not ashamed oftehooe eats&#xD;
or marks he might chance to receive from his;foes, while inithe&#xD;
.discharge of his-duty.  He had passed throngh.a many a bard&#xD;
battle unscathed, with a degree of cheerful eccentricity pl asiing&#xD;
to the 'Penn Boys' to see. - And though sometimes rough.o&#xD;
coarse in speech, yet he possessed beneath an ungainly exterior,&#xD;
a heart affectionate-and true, which caused his breast to gloir&#xD;
with impulses generous and warm. Void of malice towards}all,&#xD;
he was his own greatest enemy-liquor and his own liberality&#xD;
are the names of his greatest foes:&#xD;
He now gave his listeners a hurried explanation as to the local&#xD;
its of the fire, his suspicions etc., of the conflagration, involving&#xD;
in ruin the late property of Caleb Seigle, and.then with a degree&#xD;
of deviltry at which she could not-be provoked, gavedMyrm.g&#xD;
hasty kiss and rushed from the bose, leaving them still in *um-&#xD;
prise quite as great as when he entered, but of a different: nature.&#xD;
It was of the destruction of the miser's property.&#xD;
As Ringgold was hurrying along with spirits light and free,&#xD;
he was struck a stunningblow by a powerful man w1o was lying&#xD;
in wait for him in a dark alley, on Frankford Road near Qireen&#xD;
street. He did not see the man, shrouded as he was in darkness,&#xD;
he only caught a glimps of the outline of the arm and fist, whih&#xD;
dealt the b ow so heavy in its force, as to knock hims reeling in&#xD;
the street. The moment he struck the villain ran. As Rag--&#xD;
gold staggered and reeled endeavoring to prevent his falling, he&#xD;
fell against old Clawson, who said--&#xD;

' Ha, ha, a splendid figure. npw you are, for the gallant and&#xD;

Blakely.'&#xD;
Come, come boys, stop thi , or I'll call some of you out-&#xD;

A smothered laugh hailed this speech, and--&#xD;
' Jack's been down among t e Killers to-night, and he feels&#xD;
ugly,' concluded their taunts on poor Ringgold.&#xD;
Milford Sefton, after a number of deviations from a direct&#xD;
course, and the deciphering of several numbers stopped at length&#xD;
before Myria's door. Grasping the bell pull, he pulled stronger&#xD;
than he intended, but the fact is he had little control of himself.&#xD;
Myria hastened and opened the door. As- she did so, he stammer-&#xD;
ed out her name, and at the sound - of his voice, so unexpected,&#xD;
she started back. -   -&#xD;
'Myria, I would speak with you a moment,' he continued.&#xD;
But Myria; recovering, attempted to shut him out: In her con-&#xD;
fusion she failed, and he seeing her intention, endeavored to foil&#xD;
her, but staggeringlhe fellheadlong into the room. Myria utter-=&#xD;
ed a scream, and her parent and brother ran to her side.&#xD;
'Why Myria my love, what ,means this.-what's the matter?'&#xD;
hurriedly enquired her father, as he neared the place where the&#xD;
doctor lay stretched upon the floor,. The force with which he fell,&#xD;
tiad the effect of partially sobering him, and he soon managed to&#xD;
gain his feet.-'&#xD;
' Sir,' said Orson Blakely as Sefton . arose, 'what mean this&#xD;
abrupt entrance here?'&#xD;
'Ratker abrupt I'll allow,' Sefton sneered. 'It was an ac-&#xD;
cident, but I don't know  that I should explain the particular&#xD;
cause in all its ramifications to you, sir-I came to speak with the&#xD;
lady.'"&#xD;
'Milford Sefton, hasten fropi my presence. I wish not to&#xD;
speak with you. Already you have escaped my vengeance several&#xD;
times, why should you rush into my presence thus. Our meet.&#xD;
ing will cost you your life yet-beware-oh father, send. him&#xD;

As the sound of father fell upon Sefton'e ear from Myria's&#xD;
lips, he started and cast a rapid glance from face to face, of.&#xD;

Ing  An"again lyria, burning with the eloquence and spirit of&#xD;
her task, appeared triumphant amid applause almost unbounded.&#xD;
.Dirinigthe second and third acts, her parent and brother proud&#xD;
of her' trimphs were near her. 'But while preparations were&#xD;
being made for the final 'triumph -in the laat act, (every act in&#xD;
which h -lef 4 dpared was a triumph,) they took seats in front Hof&#xD;
thebhouse- to'itiess, with better-effect,'her final appearance..&#xD;
The tragedy closed with a sudden burst of renewed applause-&#xD;
for the great t'ragediene. They thought: not at the moment of&#xD;
their overflowing adulation in her behalf. that she, who had&#xD;
thus by a magic, mystic power enchantedithem so long with the&#xD;
beauties of the great dramatist-that she, the unhappy Myria,&#xD;
was spasmodically a maniac--that this peculiar mnystic sell was&#xD;
indeed the great source of the terrible effects of her tragic power&#xD;
over =them.&#xD;
Lng 'after 'the drop curtain struck the stage, continued the'&#xD;
eigqhnting spell of Myria's final triumph among the applauding&#xD;
audience. But as they loudly called for her, where was Myria?&#xD;
Why did she notonce again greet 'their longing vision with her&#xD;
splendid 'make lip,7 and her ripe, beautifully developed figure ?&#xD;
Why? - Again that horrid spell of iaadness was upon her, and&#xD;
she was flying through the street just as she left the stage, i a&#xD;
dress of white, and in her painted hand, the blood-colored knife&#xD;
that reached the heart of Duncan.&#xD;
]Ev'ei ge,' she shrieked-'Now to revenge 'inflong borne&#xD;
wrongs. Wretch of my ate! I'll have' thee yeti You cannot&#xD;
restore that of which you have so basely deprived me. Blood I&#xD;
-your heart's blood alone can satisfy my-vengeance.&#xD;
And thus she flew on over the street, as if in quest of the&#xD;
object of her burning revenge, Seftonthe roue.&#xD;
The night'was far advanced, and there was none, or but few&#xD;
persons stirring any distance away from  the...theatres or other&#xD;
places of amusement.&#xD;
To the upper portion of the city, towards her home, she fled&#xD;
frantic and :wild.&#xD;
Some who saw her leave the theatre,, hurried ont after her, but&#xD;
she aeon eluded and left them all i:4 the greatest wonder and, sur-&#xD;

flight, were astonished beyond measure.-&#xD;
'Oh, my. child !-my dear Myria, 'what is this borrmt tp&#xD;
- lit-h possesses - thee?' cried the afflicted father, as he ashied&#xD;
about the place in asort of delirium. '=0-God, am I to be thus&#xD;
deprived of my dear child again!N. 'I will seek heir to the&#xD;
ends of the earth. -Come, son, let us seek your sister, anid  ot&#xD;

in-great' distress, to 'seek ottthe unhappy Myria, who now -as&#xD;
far from_ the theatre, and within -a' few squares of her-home,&#xD;
though i her mad-flight she 'knew it not.&#xD;
Sefton, who had been this evening again-prowling near, her&#xD;
home, was now flying rapidly before her -down towards the river.&#xD;
Ye Gods, what a chase ! .He'saw the dreadful'knife clutched&#xD;
in her hand with such a deadlygrasp, her robe in wild disorder";&#xD;
her long hair all flying and snapping in the wind,.and her jetty"&#xD;
eyes burning with such a piercing fire of vengeance. Her whold&#xD;
demeanor stamped with a death-dealing determination. He 'stag&#xD;
gered and fled before the mad girl in a tremor of fright and de.&#xD;
spair. Such was the effect of-her resolute appearance upon  hat&#xD;
little soul he had left, that he believed his time had now gonle.&#xD;
That should he not now- meet with some particular fafor-of-&#xD;
chance, his days were indeed numbered, 'and Myria the wronged j&#xD;
one, was at last revenged.&#xD;
On he fled towards the river, designing to turn down' the&#xD;
street and escape along the dock; but the descent of the street&#xD;
here added such a velocity to hie flight, that before he could' tun&#xD;
she had run him- out to the very edge of the river. There'were&#xD;
no vessels ia the dock, but after darting several times along'-the'&#xD;
wharf, endeavoring to pass her, he dashed - behind a large post&#xD;
on one corner of the wharf, which had -been used for mooring-&#xD;
vessels fast to 'the shore. -And now commenced a sort of'-ruun-&#xD;
ning chase around the post. But it was a fearful game -the de.&#xD;
spairing villain had determined to play+with the actress-to lead&#xD;
the circular chase until she growing dizzy, he could the easier&#xD;
hurl her into the dock, and s make his escape from her. But&#xD;
he had misjudged the minutesnature of the spell which ws ai&#xD;
her. The giddinessof the chase only added vigor to the apeed&#xD;
-irth-which she kept upathe pursuit,' and lost to all -Sese of dan-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7594-00000031"/>&#xD;
er she dashed upon the libertine in a very frenzy of revenge&#xD;
and rage. Hotter and hotter grew the chase, closer and closer&#xD;
the xi  ,neared the libertine's heel&#xD;
Tired and breathless, he suddenly tt rned at bay. As he pant.&#xD;
ed an instant for'relief, he cried--&#xD;
My God Myria, one of us must conquer!&#xD;
Like the infuriated tigress, she dashe upon him.&#xD;
'Ha, ha, ha,'revenged at last.'                 -&#xD;
Just at this moment, the State House bell tolled out in clear&#xD;
loud strokes the hour of twelve.&#xD;
'Ha, ha,' she cried, 'the State House bell! Villain, it is the&#xD;
knell, that summons thee to hell.!h&#xD;
But ere she concluded, he had grasped her tightly in his arms&#xD;
and lifting her above his head, with a fearful oath he made a des-&#xD;
perate effort to dash her into the dock, As he lifted her in the&#xD;
air, the mad girl grew even more frantic than before, and again&#xD;
her fierce tragic tones rang out on tie que mn   th  ni  i&#xD;
frightful effect. ' Ha, ha, caught at last, and plunging the knife&#xD;
inohis neck, his hold of her relaxed, and as her feet reached&#xD;
ite gr unde f  again, he stumbled ,d fell over into the river.&#xD;
It was more the stunning; force of th lw  hc  ooee    is&#xD;
hod of .her, than the death dealing, depth" of the dagger.,I&#xD;
touched no vital part, but as he fell, aarge iron spike projecting&#xD;
above the wharf-edge, pierced his temples, and without doubt&#xD;
proed he  irect cause of his death. He lever rose again, but&#xD;
the body of he drunar and libertinp went to feed the fishes of&#xD;
the; gulf&#xD;
The he instant her enemy disappeare  beneath the dark waves,&#xD;
th  ecion in Myrig's bosom was sixd4en and severe. The spell of&#xD;
madness was gone, and the beautiful girl was once more a ra.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
PROCESSION-TIE ASSAULT--THE BUCK DARTS AND THE GREEKS&#xD;
.-RINGGOLD AND RAFFERTY-ARRESTS--SCENE AT THE STA-&#xD;
TION HOUSE.&#xD;
WHEN the body of Milford Sefton, (or properly Morgan Slater)&#xD;
was found, it was so disfigured, his face so mutilated by the fish&#xD;
and decay, that it was with great difficulty he could be recognized.&#xD;
It was, however, found on the -Coroner's inquest, that the per-&#xD;
foration in his temple, 'by some sharp instrument,' was the&#xD;
cause of his death.&#xD;
The night following was a season of great public rejoicing&#xD;
throughout the entire city, and an immense torch light proces-&#xD;
sion of firemen and others, added greatly to the hilarity and life&#xD;
of the occasion. Banners of every design and ,Knish, and tran-&#xD;
sparencies, comic and sentimental, innumerable, the ringing of&#xD;
bells, fireing of cannon and small arms, and music unrestrained,&#xD;
hooting and cheering constantly along the lines of the proces-&#xD;
sion, spread an untold gaiety throughout the public revel.&#xD;
The whole city was illuminated by the torches in the hands of&#xD;
those in the procession, and all along the route the ladies, (many&#xD;
of them daughters, aye and the wives too of our wealthiest and&#xD;
inoet influential and respected citizens, though the night was&#xD;
damp and cold, an eager and a nipping air prevailing at the time,)&#xD;
with glowing hearts, rosy cheeks and smiling faces, leaned out&#xD;
far ut of the doors and windows; and even over the varandas&#xD;
of their homes, waving their shawls and" handkerchiefs in the&#xD;
air, expressive of their regard and interest felt in the noble char-&#xD;
acter of the 'Philadelphia Firemen.'&#xD;
And think you as theyassed before them they failed to ap-&#xD;
preciate such interest ?  ay.! many a noble heart in that, pro-&#xD;
cession, as they met such encouragement on every hand from the&#xD;
lovely and the fair, bounded with unspeakable ardor and joy,&#xD;
and with;animpulse ready to brave any peril for those they loved.&#xD;
And they walked proudly on thus cheered on their way by our&#xD;

lovely daughters. Did they appreciate such interest in their&#xD;
behalf? aye, and down many a rough, weather beaten, and peril&#xD;
scared cheek, rolled the grateful tear as it welled up warm and&#xD;
free from the noble heart, by the power of kindness touched.&#xD;
Their route was a long one, traversing nearly the entire city,&#xD;
but on they passed happy and gay allowing all to share their joy.&#xD;
They had passed over all their route, but that portion of it lead-&#xD;
ing them through Port Richmond, and when they reached here&#xD;
the night was indeed far spent.. Still they kept on, and the af-&#xD;
fair of pleasure would have ended peaceable enough, but as they&#xD;
were returning, and about crossing the line dividing the district&#xD;
from Kensington, (the bridge) they were assailed with a heavy&#xD;
volley of bricks and stones, surely not quite so encouraging as&#xD;
the waving of ladies handkerchiefs and shawls.&#xD;
These usual missiles of the cowards were thrown in the por-&#xD;
tion of the procession occupied by the 'Penn hose company.'&#xD;
Some persons were struck by them, yet the most of them passed&#xD;
over their heads doing but little harm, save to arouse the 'Buck&#xD;
Darts' to immediate revenge for the onslaught. The volley pro-&#xD;
ceeded from behind a large fence, where the hidden foe lay&#xD;
concealed. But after hurling a second charge into the peaceable&#xD;
procession, they fled from their concealment down towards the&#xD;
Delaware. As they started up, Ringgold saw them, and dash-&#xD;
ing out of line he sounded loudly the 'war cry.'&#xD;
'Come on boys, never submit that, it's the work of the d-d&#xD;
Greeks.  Come on, pitch in now, return the compliment. Hey,&#xD;
hey, go in 'Buck Darts.' "&#xD;
Darting forward, he sprang with a bound over the fence, fol-&#xD;
lowed by a number of the most daring of his clan. Job Claw-&#xD;
son, more peaceably inclined to-night, stepped out from the head&#xD;
of'the company, and running hastily along the line of the pro-&#xD;
cession, cried at the top of his voice--&#xD;
'Come back boys, come back, don't go after the scamps and&#xD;
disgrace yourselves with a fight to-night.  tay in line and let&#xD;
them go.&#xD;
But it seemed of little use, their blood was up ; some of them&#xD;
were writhing under the pain of being struck by some of the&#xD;
missiles, and though they honored Job, and would obey him in&#xD;

THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
almost everything, yet about one half of the company ran poll&#xD;
mell, over the broad field in pursuit of the cowardly Greeks.&#xD;
And above all the noise the. bead of the drum, the shouts and&#xD;
Indian like yells of the "Buck Darts,' Ringgold's voice of en'&#xD;
couragement could be distinctly heard, leading them on to the&#xD;
attack.  Soon the police force, dispatched especially by the&#xD;
Mayor, began to make arrests along the line of the procession,&#xD;
which they had dogged over the entire route, many of them far&#xD;
away from their own beat. Like children they followed the mu-&#xD;
sic. They were out in great force, and as it has often proved,&#xD;
their very presence; the exhibition of the huge mark of office,e&#xD;
mented no small degree of ill and restless feeling in, the breasts&#xD;
of those composing the procession, who could ill brook the mor-&#xD;
tifying thought of being dogged by such bantering hirelings of&#xD;
. an imbecile Mayor.&#xD;
They had arrested several on one pretence and another during&#xD;
the commotion in the line of procession, caused by  the lawless&#xD;
band of Irishmen behind the fence. They did not arrest the&#xD;
disturbers of the peace, but those who were disturbed.&#xD;
'Three groans ,for the Irish Police,'- saluted them harshly&#xD;
from some young man more daring than his fellows in the lines.&#xD;
It was answered by a renewed stampede of the starry gentle-&#xD;
men, who succeeded in securing the offender of their immense&#xD;
dignity. They were endeavoring to drag one away, who as yet&#xD;
had took no part in the taunts thrown out, when Job Clawson&#xD;
springing between them, requested there not to, take the man,&#xD;
but a big burly officer seized Job by the.-neck, and exclairned-&#xD;
',Ah my old fellow, you're one of 'em too.-you've got to go&#xD;

i0ng.' Ye noisy whelps-come along.'&#xD;
'what do you arrest me for ? expostulated Clawson; 'I've&#xD;
done nothing except trying to keep them in line peaceably-&#xD;
what do you arrest me for ?'&#xD;
' Yer lie, yer old rascal. You're one of them too what makes&#xD;
a noise. I seed yer riotin', so come along now with the rest of&#xD;
'em.'&#xD;
'Well loosen your hold of my throat, and don't clinch me so&#xD;

tight and I'll go with you. But I'm satisfied you can substantiate&#xD;

mec a hearir.'&#xD;
'No sir'ce  "e'l     H-&#xD;

hisself. This is his express orders for all we catch to-night.'&#xD;
'Deny a prisoner a hearing, I never heard of such a thing.&#xD;
What is the law on the subject? Does it not allow us to be heard&#xD;
before the nearest Alderman ?'&#xD;
I don't know what the law is, an what it paint. I know er&#xD;
my prisoner, an the Mayor wants to see yor hisself, that's al.-&#xD;
come along without any more of yer grumbling or may be I wont&#xD;
liscen to much more of it.'"&#xD;
Job finally concluded it best to go peaceably with the ffi&#xD;
and thus probably receive less of his ill will and hard treatmer.&#xD;
Suffice it here, that with several others, he was locked up in the&#xD;
station house. In the mean time, the battle was raging on the&#xD;
banks of the Delaware between the 'oBuck Dats,' le  n by the&#xD;
dauntless Jack Ringgold, and the ' sons of Killarney' led onb&#xD;
the burly, athletic coal heater Donolon Rafferty.&#xD;
'Firce and bloody grew the struggle. Stones and all sorts&#xD;
ouge missiles few from both sides as they fought on the edge&#xD;
of the river. Large sticks and clubs, broken from the fences of&#xD;
the fields were brought into requisition by the ' Buck Darts'&#xD;
with fearful telling effect, and many a brawny dark visiaged&#xD;
Greek lay on the green sod bleeding and sore.&#xD;
'Murther ! murther ! It's kilt intirely I am,' yelled many a&#xD;
one, as the ' Buck Darts' closed in with them andlvlldte&#xD;
one after the other to the ground i  d    and levelled them&#xD;
' Hip, hip, hurrah ! By the soul of St. Patrick, ye d-d Spa1-&#xD;
pees, come at me and I'le dale ye a sweetner with my sprig of&#xD;
k.    , t    send ye wizzin into the middle of next week,&#xD;
sakeing a patch for yer eye. Hip, hip.'&#xD;
This was yelled in a tone of defiance towards Ringgold, who&#xD;
had just torn the second half rail from the fence having lost his&#xD;
first club in the struggle.&#xD;

74                 THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.&#xD;
over large in stature, but he was solid and sinewy. When he&#xD;
struck a man he never failed to make an impression. Nor was&#xD;
he wanting in skill, and of courage and daring we have seen&#xD;
before, he had no lack.&#xD;
His present antagonist, Donolon Rafferty, came up before him&#xD;
like a huge ungainly Collossus. LHe stood some six feet four&#xD;
inches, and stout and burly in proportion. His frame also seem-&#xD;
ed all muscle and compactly knit, but he was slow in his actions.&#xD;
For a moment, as the savage Irishman's rough voice fell on&#xD;
Ringgold's ear, Jack glanced at his heavy athletic figure; and&#xD;
as he now thought he had an -opportunity to av nge the blow.&#xD;
with which Rafferty had waylaid him on Frankf rd Road, near&#xD;
Queen street, with a shrill whoop, which for a moment discon-&#xD;
certed Rafferty, he bounded forward, yelling-&#xD;
"Then lay on Macduff,&#xD;
And damned be he who first cries hold, enough!1'&#xD;
Whirling the huge club about his head, he sprang like the en-&#xD;
raged lion on his foe, and bringing it down with all the strength&#xD;
he could command, he missed his aim, for Rafferty leaning aside&#xD;
his head, caught the blow broadside on his shillaleh which made&#xD;
both wince again with the pain it gave them in the wrists and&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
As they stood thus an instant glaring at each other savagely,&#xD;
Rafferty made a sudden grasp for Ringgold's throat, but catch-&#xD;
ing the movement he threw up his club again, and striking him&#xD;
across the arms with it, he staggered off some paces from him ;&#xD;
but coming up again hurriedly and eagerly, he brought poor Jack&#xD;
a tremendous swipe ' athwart stern ship,' which lifted him clear&#xD;
off the ground and fired him with very madness.&#xD;
'Hell and furies, ye dam'd red-eyed imp,' cried Ringgold&#xD;
smarting with pain, and again hurling his long club through the&#xD;
air furiously, brought it do n so forcibly and quick on Rafferty's&#xD;
neck, that he sank to the ground on his knees.&#xD;
'Och, ye dam'd heretic, ye'd kill me ye would;' and flourish-&#xD;
in his shillaleh, he tried' o rise, but before he could do so, the&#xD;
active Jack followed up his advantage; dealt him another of the&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.                75&#xD;
same sort a trifle higher, which levelled him quite to the round&#xD;
and he began to cry lustily for mercy. qithgrn&#xD;
Och! murther! murther ! It's klin me ye are,' and drop-&#xD;
ping his club,ingold commencsweredplaying upon him with his&#xD;
fits  T  hs ris orhep haswre&#xD;
'Ye cowardly imp, ye waylaid me, did ye? Ye struck me in&#xD;
the drk, did ye?' and then run. But ha, ha, I've caught ye at&#xD;
last. Now I'll give ye a receipt in full for all I've ever received&#xD;
from ye, ye Irish coward.'&#xD;
And while the poor fellow groaned and begged for his life,&#xD;
the maddrene R  ol plugged him well. The-balance of those&#xD;
who had regained their feet, had in the meantime fled before the&#xD;
conquering 'Buck Darts;' who left them manymementos in the&#xD;
shape of bruises, black eyes, and bleeding noses, by which to re&#xD;
member them, and their attack on the peaceable procession&#xD;
Soon asRinggold heard of Clawson's arrest, he hastily repair-&#xD;
ed with a friendyto the Station House, although he knew well,&#xD;
thr ao   mayhee    who would like right well to get hold of&#xD;
hm also. The place was closed, and well guarded with officers&#xD;
and as Ringgold entered, he presented a ludicrous and indeed a&#xD;
'rough and ready' appearance. His coat torn again, his face&#xD;
scratched and bloody, and his pantaloon extremities indifferent-&#xD;
y tucked into his boot-tops  He looked the impersonation of&#xD;
the leader of a reckless and daring bandit.&#xD;
He felt keenly for his friend Job Clawson, yet,just comin&#xD;
out of the blood conflict with the 'Greeks,' het just coming&#xD;
ture too far into the lion's den of the w e cared not to ven-&#xD;
Clarence Clinton forward, to plead for his fellow memberien&#xD;

Clarenceknocked at the door; and after repeating the opera-&#xD;
tion several times the lieutenant put his head out, and inquired&#xD;
his wishes. He was answered that he wanted a hearing of the&#xD;
charge or charges against Job Clawson who was now confined&#xD;
in one of the cells. The lieutenant stepped out, closing the door&#xD;
im wi     e greatest precaution. They feared an attack&#xD;
on the station house, hence their care. Clarence asked to set&#xD;
Clawson, but was promptly denied allcommunication with any&#xD;
of the prisoners. 'But,' he urged, ' he should have a hearing.&#xD;

76                THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE,&#xD;
Again he was reminded of the Mayor's ' especial orders' being&#xD;
to ' allow none of the prisoners arrested that night a hearing, but&#xD;
send them directly down to him!'&#xD;
Still Clarence and Ringgold lingered, hoping yet to succeed&#xD;
in their object of obtaining good old Job Clawson's release that&#xD;
night. ,But they had not waited long before they heard the&#xD;
shuffling and tread of many feet inside. ' The lieutenant opened&#xD;
the door again, and the prison van then drawing up, the prison-&#xD;
ers were conducted forth at midnight, each one guarded by two&#xD;
officers, with all the dignity and stateliness and awe, as though&#xD;
they were an oath-bound league of desperadoes or Venetian con-&#xD;
spirators. In the midst of the line walked Clawson, head erect,&#xD;
an eye of fire, and a heart of steel. As Jack caught sight, of&#xD;
him, walking thus pinioned by the law, towards the prison van,&#xD;
his heart filled with pain and grief, the big tears of anguish and&#xD;
sympathy coursed down his rugged cheeks like rain-drops.&#xD;
Springing in front of Job, he cried,&#xD;
'My God, Clawson, my old friend, I cannot bear to see this.&#xD;
Officer, take me and let him go home to his family. I have no&#xD;
wife awaiting my return home; take me, and let my friend go&#xD;
free ; he is innocent I know.'&#xD;
He was pushed out of the way with the threat, that if he in-&#xD;
terfered again he should be taken too.,&#xD;
'My God ! take me-take me ; but don't take my friend,'&#xD;
poor Ringgold cried, dashing the fast falling tears from his eyes.&#xD;
In the confusion Clawson was hurried into the van before he&#xD;
could speak a word. But as he placed his foot on the step to&#xD;
ascend, Ringgold again caught a glimpse of him, and cried out,&#xD;
'My God, Job ! if they will take you, good bye ; but keep up&#xD;
your head, and in the morning we'll be on hand to do for you all&#xD;
we can.'&#xD;
'Good bye, Jack,' cried Clawson, as the van drove off; 'Cla-&#xD;
rence look out for bail--good by.'&#xD;
" All right-aye, aye-good bye,' saluted him in return; and&#xD;
the van was driven rapidly away. Ringgold and Clarence turned&#xD;
away with hearts heavy and sad. Proceeding slowly homeward,&#xD;
they consulted how they should break the disagreeable intelli-&#xD;
gence to Clawson's wife of his arrest. It was past midnight&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.                 77&#xD;
when they reached his residence, and Mrs. Clawson, after wait-&#xD;
ing and watching long, had retired; but they did not knock often&#xD;
before she hurried to the door expecting to meet her husband.&#xD;
But when she saw him not, and in his stead beheld Ringgold and&#xD;
Clarence she started back from the door and trembled like the&#xD;
frightened fawn. She knew them, but feared the worst. Clar&#xD;
ence hastily relieved her fears by informing her that he believed&#xD;
her husband was innocent of any crime, and that'in the morn-&#xD;
ing they would procure bail and effect his release. This tran-&#xD;
quilized her sorrow, and thanking them, bade them 'good night,'&#xD;
and again they turned towards their homes, taking in their way&#xD;
the hose house, to impart the result of their visit to the station&#xD;
house to those members of the company who might still be there.&#xD;
We need scarce dilate upon the surprise of all when they&#xD;
heard that their loved and honorary member was thus hurried&#xD;
away so soon after his arrest to appear before the Mayor.&#xD;
Nor will we complain of the false and reckless swearing on&#xD;
the part of the officers next day on the trial.  They were fully&#xD;
exposed, their incompetence shown, and the ' Buck Darts' ably&#xD;
defended by one of our young and rising lawyers, who is even&#xD;
now an ornament to the ' Philadelphia Bar,' and destined yet to&#xD;
outshine many of his present compeers. We are almost tempted&#xD;
to give his name, for we feel proud of his noble and volunteered&#xD;
defence of the right on that occasion.&#xD;
Nor shall we speak of the just and glorious ease with which&#xD;
the tables were turned in that trial, against some of the intelligent&#xD;
and extremely officious guardians of the public peace, when it&#xD;
was amply proven that they themselves were the actual disturbers&#xD;
of the peace, and were so intoxicated and pugnacious at the time&#xD;
that they could not tell what the arrests were made for. We do&#xD;
not glory that some of them were in turn made to snuff the damp&#xD;
uncongenial vapor of a prison cell, and anon when released from&#xD;
'durance vile,' found to their chagrin and unspeakable dismay,&#xD;
their occupation gone.&#xD;
Oh no, but we will say ' three times three' for young lawyer&#xD;
S., the American attorney, the gentleman, and scholar'; and we&#xD;
doubt not, there are those who can testify that they were given&#xD;
with a full heart and hearty will, when his legal ability and&#xD;
matchless eloquence set the 'Buck Darts' free.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
MOONLIGHT ON 'THE DEL AWARE-LOVE--THE RETURN-BETROTHAL&#xD;
-THE HIDDEN FOE-DESPERATE E       CUNTER-TERRIBLE BLOW.&#xD;
IT was a calm moon-light night, and the myriads of. twinkling&#xD;
stars in the clear evening sky, reflected themselves in the mirror&#xD;
like bosom of the glistning waters of the Delaware, as the tide&#xD;
flowing easily up, undulating so gently that the crowded ship.&#xD;
ping bristling along its waves, scarcely gave evidence of the&#xD;
slightest motion. The lights of Camden city glimmered faintly&#xD;
in the distance, and the church and cathedral spires of Philadel.&#xD;
phia almost piercing the white clouds of the lovely summer eve,&#xD;
glistened like silver in the noon tide rays of the burning sun.&#xD;
All over the broad expanse, on the sleeping waters reposed the&#xD;
same resplendant sheen of quiet light ; but it was varied slightly&#xD;
on the smooth waters by gently moving shadows, which dotted&#xD;
its bright surface like spirits of the enchanted deep.&#xD;
They were pleasuring parties, sailing in the quiet evening on&#xD;
the lovely Delaware.  And anon the gay-song and blithesome&#xD;
laugh danced over the calm waters, taken up, joined and con.&#xD;
tinued, until dancing and dancing away, they are lost in glad and&#xD;
silvery echos in the far distance. But list, as the entrancing&#xD;
strain, dear to every American's heart, floats out upon the waters&#xD;
from a boat containing a happy company of lovers-&#xD;
My country 'tis of thee,&#xD;
Sweet land of liberty,&#xD;
Of thee 1 sing ;&#xD;
Land where my Father's died,&#xD;
Land of the Pilgrim's pride,&#xD;
From every mountain side,&#xD;
Let freedom ring.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.                    71)&#xD;
My native country, thee-&#xD;
Land of the noble, free-&#xD;
Thy name I love;&#xD;
I love thy rocks and rills,&#xD;
Thy woods and templed hills,&#xD;
My heart with rapture thrills&#xD;
Like that above.&#xD;
Let music swell the breeze,&#xD;
And ring from all the trees&#xD;
Sweet freedom's song ;&#xD;
Let mortal tongues awake,&#xD;
Let all that breathe partake ;&#xD;
Let rocks their silence break-&#xD;
The sound prolong.'&#xD;
In the speechless rapture of the moment, the enchanted Ring.&#xD;
gold rested listlessly on his oar, and drank in with eyes moistened&#xD;
with joy, the delicious music of his loved Myria's voice as she&#xD;
poured her soul into the lines of that patriotic song. And Clarence&#xD;
dipped his oar softly, and his companion listened delighted as&#xD;
the heart of the singer grew warm with the sterring eloquence&#xD;
of 'Sweet Freedom's Song.'&#xD;
But the boat now needed no guide, it floated gently up with&#xD;
the easy movement of the tide, resting on the glistening waters&#xD;
light and graceful as the noble swan.&#xD;
But, oh, what exquisite, happy feelings glowed in the bosom of&#xD;
Ringgold, as the music of his loved one's voice thrilled upon the&#xD;
chords of his own soul, in harmony so soft and sweet. Never&#xD;
had he experienced such a thrill of calm holy bliss before: 'twas&#xD;
like the sudden breaking of a new heaven of joy in his breast,&#xD;
and far from the reach 'of language to express. Therefore, un-&#xD;
able to syllable even her dear name, be dropped his head on her&#xD;
neck as he sat by her side, and shared the Elysian extacy in that&#xD;
tranquility of soul, which is--&#xD;
More than angel's tongues can tell&#xD;
Or angel's minds conceive.'&#xD;
We deem this a fitting moment to note particularly the excel&#xD;
lent change, which the disposition and character, aye, and senti&#xD;
ments and lauguage, too, of the daring Ringgold has undergone.&#xD;
Not that the nobility of his soul has been lost, but many of the&#xD;

80&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
rougher features of his disposition, errors of a neglected and de-&#xD;
ficient education, and coarse manner of expression have been&#xD;
softened down and polished, by the etiquette and gentle love&#xD;
training of the versatile and accomplished Myria. And love and&#xD;
-associations has done it all. Kindness has made the hardy Jack&#xD;
the apt and willing pupil, beneath the gentle training of his&#xD;
tutor ; and thus gradually he has partaken of her sentiments,&#xD;
her hopes, her high resolves, her noble inspiration, and even a&#xD;
better language in a word, though at first so widely diverse, yet&#xD;
they are now both of the same mind.&#xD;
They were now leisurely floating up the easy flowing river, and&#xD;
as Myria concluded her song, she called upon her companion,&#xD;
Emily Hope, to likewise favor them with a ditty..-&#xD;
'Come Emily,' said she, 'let us hear how your voice will sound&#xD;
on the water. lIm told that a good song on the water, sounds&#xD;
much better than any where else.'&#xD;
'It may be so,' replied the youthful Emily, diffidently ; ' but&#xD;
my voice is weak, and then-I believe it to be more injurious to&#xD;
sing in the open air, than in the concert room. Not only so,&#xD;
but I would rather listen, than sing to night, Myria.'&#xD;
Ha ! ha!' laughed Myria gaily, without noticing the compli-&#xD;
ment -which concluded her companions' speech. ' For the real&#xD;
enjoyment of song, give me nature's own concert room, with the&#xD;
calm waters for my stage-the clear heavens for my sounding&#xD;
board-the bright moon for my chandelier, and the smiling and&#xD;
applauding stars for my audience. Then, oh then, I can be&#xD;
happy ! But come, Emily, I cannot do all the singing to-night,&#xD;
we must hear you.'&#xD;
' cannot to-night, Myria.'&#xD;
'Sing, and Clarence will help you. Or, lead us in something&#xD;
we're acquainted with, and we'll help you,' spoke Ringgold at&#xD;
length, half rising from his reclining posture on his fair Myria's&#xD;
neck.&#xD;
Well, if you insist on it, I'll try,' said Emily. And soon from&#xD;
out that little boat, there was a loud and graceful chorus sound-&#xD;
ed which started the quiet waters into ripples, and sounded in&#xD;
gay echosfar off to the shore.&#xD;
Thus they whiled several happy hours away, in their pleasant&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
moonlight sail on the quiet Delaware, and it was almost midnight&#xD;
ere they quit their boat for home.&#xD;
Clarence and Emily getting out first, walked leisurely away;&#xD;
Ringgold and Myria stepped, out, and after securing the boat,&#xD;
followed at a slower pace. Once or twice, Emily and Clarence&#xD;
looked back, but seeing them  coming, walked slowly on.  But&#xD;
slower and slower grew the pace of the thought absorbed happy&#xD;
lovers. Ringgold enraptured, was now discoursing love to the&#xD;
happy listening Myria as he never spake before. At his soul&#xD;
gushing eloquence, Myria was surprised and delighted.  He&#xD;
offered her his hand, and was accepted.&#xD;
Still they paced easily and leisurely along, all absorbed in the&#xD;
unspeakable bliss of betrothal.&#xD;
Once Ringgold looked up and caught a glimpse of their com-&#xD;
panions, just as they turned off the river road into another street.&#xD;
He spoke to Myria, and they quickened their pace to overtake&#xD;
them ere they reached home.&#xD;
They had walked a couple of squares, and were passing be-&#xD;
neath the broad shadow of the ever memorable 'Elm Tree of&#xD;
Peace,' when a rough murmuring voice caused Ringgold to look&#xD;
around.&#xD;
'The d-d native spalpeen, he's been sailing to-night wid his&#xD;
gal; and she's been singing' to him, the wench. I'de like to&#xD;
spile their beauty, I would, wid my sprig of shillaleh and sham-&#xD;
rock so green,' grumbled Donolon Rafferty, for it was he, but&#xD;
raising his voice slightly, he concluded his speech with a slight&#xD;
degree of his own peculiar melody, actually singing the last line ;&#xD;
and then, stepping out from behind the tree, he flourished his&#xD;
club in a boisterous and murderous manner about lRinggold's&#xD;
head.&#xD;
Myria was not a coward, as we know, but the suddeness with&#xD;
which the attack was made, caused her to start. She uttered&#xD;
but one shriek of alarm, and then she was herself again, com-&#xD;
posed and ready for her own defence. Jack backed off several&#xD;
paces from his brawny assailant, who followed him up closely,&#xD;
flourishing his club in his very face. Once he commanded him&#xD;
to desist or he would shoot him down.&#xD;
Ye would, would ye, ye dam'd spalpeen-take that then to&#xD;
help ye a little-' and the Greek made a terrible dash at Ring-&#xD;
gold's head with his club. But JacK, quick in his movements as&#xD;
the cat, stepped aside, and drawing out his pistol presented it in&#xD;
the rough face of his savage foe, with the words--&#xD;
'Now, sir, I do not wish your blood on my hands, but if you&#xD;
do not leave me pass without further molestation, I will surely&#xD;
give you the contents of this-'&#xD;
Rafferty's bronsed face, blanched even in the darkness, and in&#xD;
an instant his courage left him. He backed off from the ugly&#xD;
looking revolver, stuttering-&#xD;

' I-I, ask-beg yer pardon sir. I believe I've made some&#xD;
mistake here, sir-yer a gentleman sir, and not the man I took&#xD;
ye for. Don't shoot, and I'll not make such a mistake again.'&#xD;
' Then right about face,' said Jack, assuming a marshal-like&#xD;
air ; ' and locomote on a straight line for Richmond, fast as your&#xD;
feet will carry you. Ready ! leave-' he concluded, as Rafferty&#xD;
turned to run.&#xD;
They watched him until he darted round a corner out of sight,&#xD;
and then they moved rapidly on toward their home. Ten minutes&#xD;
walk brought them to Beach street, but as they proceeded, they&#xD;
did not see the revengeful figure of a man following them closely,&#xD;
and at intervals darting into open alley's along the way, until at&#xD;
length without detection, the distance grew shorter and shorter&#xD;
between them. Several times he made terrible efforts to strike,&#xD;
but certain movements of Ringgolds', induced the assassin to&#xD;
think he was suspected ; and then he would dart up an alley, and&#xD;
after remaining quiet for some minutes, would steal forth again&#xD;
and crouch after the lovers like the vengeful tiger.&#xD;
At length, they had gained their home. The door opened -&#xD;
Myria disappeared, and Jack just entered as the sound like the&#xD;
explosion of a cannon echoed through the house, and through&#xD;
the neighborhood most dolefully.&#xD;
'Gracious ! what is that ? ejaculated Myria, as turning she&#xD;
saw the door panels shattered from top to bottom. Jack turned&#xD;
also, and starting with alarm, cried-&#xD;
'Can it be possible that villain has followed us after all, and&#xD;
done this?'&#xD;
Jack had rightly suspected, for though, when he opened the&#xD;
door he saw no one, Rafferty had followed them closely, and as a&#xD;
last chance, ran and struck with all his strength as Ringgold en-&#xD;
tered. The door was just closed in time to catch the full force&#xD;
of the blow, and was shattered into splinters, beneath the Irish-&#xD;
man's ponderous club.&#xD;

RETRIBUTION--CONCLUSION.&#xD;
IT was an evening of great rejoicing, that witnessed the pecu-&#xD;
liar and lavish preparations to celebrate the wedding of Myria&#xD;
Blakely and Jack Ringgold. In fact, several days were employ-&#xD;
ed to renovate and refit the rooms of the company, at their house.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.                83&#xD;
First, the upholsterer and cabinet maker were called in, tc re-&#xD;
pair and polish the furniture, chairs, &amp;amp;c.,-then the painter's&#xD;
skill was brought in lavish requisition; the room was freshly&#xD;
painted, pictures and other ornaments were retouched, so that&#xD;
.on the evening of the marriage festival, the place was indeed&#xD;
beautiful to see. A fine new carpet covered the floor, the fur-&#xD;
niture renewed, glistened in the bright gas light, and the old&#xD;
pictures, relics of the. company, dazzled again in their regilt&#xD;
frames.&#xD;
Myria laughed heartily when the eccentric Jack proposed to&#xD;
celebrate their wedding, within the grotesque hose house. But&#xD;
she concluded at length to be married there.&#xD;
As she entered, leaning on the arm of her lover, she appeared&#xD;
lovely indeed. Attired in white, with a light veil thrown loosely&#xD;
over her head and reaching down almost to the ground. In her&#xD;
jet glossy hair, two white rose buds reposed, and these, except-&#xD;
ing the ring, were the only ornaments she wore.&#xD;
Jack was dressed in black, save his gloves and vest, and when&#xD;
he reached the hose house, he arrayed himself in his fire cape&#xD;
and hat, which added to his appearance a beautiful contrast. The&#xD;
rest of the company did the same.&#xD;
At one end of the room, a handsome pair of American flags,&#xD;
borne by a large bronsed eagle, hung suspended immediately&#xD;
above Ringgold and his bride, At the opposite end of the room,&#xD;
hung in a heavy rose wood frame, the portrait of America's glory,&#xD;
Washington, as if smiling on the happy scene.. On one side, a&#xD;
large picture of an old Indian, a noble representative of the poor&#xD;
red man, looked from the painted wall in grim seriousness; while&#xD;
immediately opposite, William Penn, the peace loving Quaker,&#xD;
spread his hands in tranquil treaty beneath the noble elm, for&#xD;
the lands of Pennsylvania.&#xD;
All were waiting, and when the minister entered, they arose&#xD;
to their feet, and welcomed him thus with a respectful inclination&#xD;
into their midst. He advanced to the' hymenial altar, beneath&#xD;
the floating flags, and turning calmly, looked over the assemblage&#xD;
wilh a smile of approbation and pleasure. Then as he raised&#xD;
his eyes to heaven, and spread his hands over them in prayer ;&#xD;
each head dropped in silent veneration and respect, to the glowing&#xD;
petition offered in their behalf. As he concluded the benediction,&#xD;
he turned, and in a few words and an impressive manner, encir-&#xD;
cled Ringgold and'Myria with the golden girdle of the marriage&#xD;
vow. But as they smiled fondly on each other and stepped aside,&#xD;
another pair kneeled suddenly at the altar, and still the cere-&#xD;
mony went on.&#xD;
'Yes Clarence, take her, and be to her a husband as I have&#xD;
been a father,' said old Job Clawson, as he dashed away a teal&#xD;
of joy,.and smiled with delight as Clarence Clinton approached&#xD;
with his lovely betrothed.&#xD;

84               THE, FIREMAN'S BRIDE.&#xD;
And as they stood before the minister, the. youthful Emily&#xD;
Hope, though happy in her choice, rested her gloved hand in his,&#xD;
and blushing answered timidly to the words of the sacred con-&#xD;
tract which made her the willing wife of the mechanic author,&#xD;
Clarence Clinton.&#xD;
Emily, by the death of both her parents was early left an or-&#xD;
phan. But she soon found a home with the noble fireman, Job&#xD;
Clawson, who, having no children, loved her as a tender father.&#xD;
And although her union with Clarence was sudden to him, yet he&#xD;
entrusted her freely into the care of his friend, because he knew&#xD;
he would prove to his adopted, all that a husband should.&#xD;
That night, Clinton and his bride reposed serenely within the&#xD;
peaceful enclosure of Clawson's home ; who declared that he&#xD;
could not yet give Emily up entirely, but that they must at least&#xD;
pass their honey moon with him.&#xD;
Ringgold and Myria repaired to her father's house on Beach&#xD;
street. But alas! their slumbers were. fated to be far less secure,&#xD;
than that of their young friends ; for, far past the hour of mid-&#xD;
night,:and when all within the quiet precincts of the Blakely&#xD;
mansion were locked in. silent sleep, the incendiary's torch was&#xD;
stealthily applied beneath them, and ere they were aroused, the&#xD;
subtle element was circling them within his fiery folds with fright-&#xD;
ful threatning glare.:&#xD;
The. heavy atmosphere of the. dark cloud-rifted midnight&#xD;
seemed .all in ablaze, and soon a general alarm was: loudly&#xD;
sounded by 4he faithful old sentinel, the State House bell. Thou-&#xD;
sands of the hardy sons: of flane,:the city firemen, hurried with&#xD;
their apparatus; to the spene of disaster.&#xD;
The,'Penn; bays':being eo near, were among the first on the&#xD;
spot, and. great indeed was their surprise to find the well known&#xD;
Blakely mansion sheeted in flames ; for it was yet scarce an hour&#xD;
since a number of, them were. engaged in the pleasing task of&#xD;
giving their fellow member Ringgold, and his bride, a bridal ser-&#xD;
enade. For some moments they scarcely knew how to act, so&#xD;
great was their surprise. But knowing that their friends must&#xD;
still be within, they hastily set about to save them, and loudly the&#xD;
cry went up-.                                 ..&#xD;
'A ladder, boys, a ladder. We must save those inside that&#xD;
house.&#xD;
Presently a stout ladder was leaned against the second story&#xD;
window, but just as it struck the window sill, a window of the&#xD;
third story was thrown up, a:d Orson Blakely with his son call-&#xD;
ed for assistance. In a moment, another ladder was cast up against&#xD;
the burning house, the parent placed his son upon the ladder,&#xD;
and then stepped out himself.i Both descended rapidly-alarm&#xD;
and solicitude depicted vividly upon their blanched faces as they&#xD;
cast anxious glances towards the second story of the burning&#xD;
house.&#xD;
&#xD;
N&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FIREMAN'S BiUDE.                85&#xD;
A fireman was at the' window, with a blow he dashed the sash&#xD;
away and sprang in; a moment of intense suspense ensued, and&#xD;
another leaped into the room. They were Clawson and Clinton.&#xD;
Another moment elapsed, and then, in the ,centre of a dense&#xD;
volume of smoke Clarence appeared at the window; and descend-&#xD;
ing the ladder, bore in his arms. the almost inanimate -form of&#xD;
Myria. Every breath was hushed in anxious expectancy, until&#xD;
Job re-appeared and sprang out on the ladder with Ringgold&#xD;
clinging to him. Then one wild shout rent the air, and tears of&#xD;
sympathy and joy glistened in many an eye.&#xD;
They were carried through the crowd to the nearest drug store,&#xD;
where with prompt attention they soon revived. But they had&#xD;
been well nigh suffocated-overpowered to helplessness by the&#xD;
subtle influence of the smoke which so suddenly filled the.room.&#xD;
When Jack came to himself, he clasped Clawson warmly by the&#xD;
hand, and from the depth of his soul, said--&#xD;
'My God Job ! I owe you a debt now which I fear I can never&#xD;
repay. You have saved my life-.I was almost gone, and could&#xD;
neither help myself nor my wife. And you, Clary,' he continued&#xD;
addressing Clinton warmly, ' God bless you! you saved my wife,&#xD;
and I know she will bless you.all the days of her life,' be con-&#xD;
cluded, gazing with unutterable affection in the face of his yonng&#xD;
bride of whom the fire fiend threatened to rob him so early.&#xD;
Myria could say but little, but her tears of heartfelt gratitude&#xD;
amply rewarded Clarence for his gallantry in saving.her fromzthe&#xD;
burning .house.&#xD;
Her glad parent and brother embraced her by turns and gave&#xD;
utterance to her joy in thanking her deliverer for her safety. .&#xD;
In the midst of their joys they were .startled by.the ground&#xD;
rocking beneath their feet, and in the next instant a tremendous&#xD;
report like the bursting of a powder magazine fell on their ears.&#xD;
'What in the world.is. that?' ejaculated Orson.&#xD;
'Mercy !' shrieked Myria, :trembling.&#xD;
' The_ walls havefallen!' said Clawson after a pause.&#xD;
' That is it,' joined Clinton, and. started for the-street.&#xD;
The walls of the burning house had fallen with a crash, smoth-&#xD;
ering the fire quite, out ard. filling :the' street .and neighborhood&#xD;
with dense clouds. of .dust; leaving darkness resting upon every&#xD;
thing without, like a pall. But amid all, what - is that confused&#xD;
and .startling murmur ?&#xD;
''A man under the ruins.'&#xD;
And while the scene is filled up 'with confusion by the ringing&#xD;
of carriage bells, calling their members together, and the hurry-&#xD;
ing to and fro of spectators, many fall to work digging out the&#xD;
unfortunate man from the burning ruins.&#xD;
&#xD;

THE FIREMAN'S BRIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Bricks and rubbish fly in every direction before the active hu-&#xD;
mane fireman, impelled by the warmest impulses of the human&#xD;
breast.&#xD;
Half an hours' toil brings them to the fatal spot where lies the&#xD;
buried man. He is reached, but he is dead, and dreadfully char-&#xD;
red by the hot bricks which covered him. They drag him forth&#xD;
and carry him to the light that they may recognise him.&#xD;
The dead man was Donolon Rafferty. Fatal retribution'! It&#xD;
was he who watching Ringgold so closely, determined on a cow-&#xD;
ard's revenge, and applied the torch to the Blakely mansion,&#xD;
whither he had tracked Ringgold on the night of his wedding.&#xD;
He fired the premises and then retired a short distance to&#xD;
chuckle over his accomplished revenge. But his revengeful joy&#xD;
was of short duration, for venturing too near, the walls fell upon&#xD;
him and he was buried beneath the ruins.&#xD;
Thus are the vicious often ensnaredin their own net.&#xD;
Dennis McFlinn is now in Penitentiary for stealing, and Patrick&#xD;
McGinnis was discharged from  the police force, for an assault&#xD;
and battery upon a man whom heundertook to arrest.&#xD;
Orson Blakely was partly of English, and partly of Spanish&#xD;
origin. His lady, Mrs. Blakely, was a beautiful Creole, born in&#xD;
the sunny Isle of St. Jago de Cuba. Her death, scarce five&#xD;
years after their marriage, was mourned by her companion who&#xD;
dearly loved her. In the year 18-, he became somewhat en-&#xD;
tangled with the slave traffic, and by the vigilance of the Ameri-&#xD;
can government against the curse, he was partially detected and&#xD;
pursued, as we showed in our first chapter. Hence his flight for&#xD;
protection to the Jew. But in the suffering of almost death, and&#xD;
so long an absence from his beloved children, has he not attoned&#xD;
fully for the crime.&#xD;
'What more shall we say?  The William Penn hose carriage&#xD;
is still the beauty of* the Eighteenth Ward. Job Clawson is&#xD;
still an honorary member, and much beloved by the company.&#xD;
Clarence Clinton loves Emily his wife, and still finds occas-&#xD;
sional leisure from his daily business, to write for the press of.&#xD;
his native city.&#xD;
Charles Blakely, Myria's brother, has gone to California,&#xD;
where he has married; and often writes to his sister and parent&#xD;
of his brilliant prospects in the land of gold.&#xD;
Jack ' Ringgold, the eccentric but noble hearted fireman, is&#xD;
-contented and happy with Myria his bride.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE END.&#xD;
