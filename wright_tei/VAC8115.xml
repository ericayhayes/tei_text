IN the kitchen door of an old, weather-worn farm-house stood&#xD;
Mr. Abimelech Jackwood, filling his pipe for an after-dinner&#xD;
smoke, and looking up at the sky with an air of contemplative&#xD;
wisdom.&#xD;
"Is it go'n' to rain, think ?" asked Abimelech the younger,-&#xD;
commonly called Bim, -holding out his hand to see if he could&#xD;
catch a sprinkle. "Say, father -Confound your pictur'!"&#xD;
The anathema was addressed, not to the parent Jackwood, by&#xD;
any means but to the dog Rover, who, seeing- the boy's hand&#xD;
extended in a manner which appeared provocative of sport, leaped&#xD;
up from the door-stone, where he had been lying, with his chin on&#xD;
his paws, snapping at the flies, and pounced upon the shoulder of&#xD;
the younger Abimelech.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood preserved a circumspect silence, while his saga-&#xD;
cious eye seemed to explore every square yard of sky visible&#xD;
between the two ranges of the Green Mountains that bounded&#xD;
the valley.&#xD;
" I never knowed the sign to fail," he observed, after mature&#xD;
deliberation, crowding the tobacco into his pipe-bowl with his&#xD;
thumb, " that when you see a light mist, like the smoke of a-&#xD;
chimbly, movin' acrost the face of the Eagle Rocks, 'arly in&#xD;

8              THE MOUTH OF WILD RIVER.&#xD;
mornin', - like what there was this mornin',  there '11 be rain&#xD;
within four-'n-twenty hours. Them 'ere clouds is jest what I&#xD;
expected; but 'mebby they '11 hold off all the arternoon. I don't&#xD;
see no crows on the dead ellum yit."&#xD;
" I wish you 'd go a-fishin'," said Abimelech. "It 's Sat'day,&#xD;
and we shan't do much work if we stay to hum."&#xD;
" I ben thinkin' a little about tryin' a hand at the fish, myself,"&#xD;
responded Mr. Jackwood, lighting his pipe at the kitchen stove.&#xD;
" But I guess, Bim'lech," - puff, puff, -" we '11 finish hoein' that&#xD;
little patch o' 'taters fust," - puff, puff, puff,--"then see how&#xD;
the weather looks. How 're ye on 't for hooks an' lines ?"&#xD;
Abimelech made haste to find the fishing-tackle, and submit it&#xD;
to his father's inspection..&#xD;
" How spry you be, Bim!" cried his sister Phoebe,- a bright-&#xD;
eyed, rosy-cheeked girl of sixteen, - over the dinner-dishes. "If&#xD;
you 'd been asked to bring a pail of water, 't would have taken&#xD;
you twice as long to start.",&#xD;
" Tell her you don't go a-fishin' every day," said Mr. Jackwood,&#xD;
good-naturedly. "Where's your sinkers, boy ?"&#xD;
Bim entered into a long and complicate history of the manner&#xD;
in which, by various mischances, the sinkers had become lost or&#xD;
destroyed.   .&#xD;
" I can tell a straighter story than that," laughed Phoebe, flirt-&#xD;
ing the table-cloth at the chickens.  " He took the sinkers, and&#xD;
all the other lead he could find, to run a cannon to shoot Inde-&#xD;
pendence with. The top of the pewter tea-pot went the same&#xD;
way.&#xD;
Bim looked troubled under his father's reproof.;&#xD;
' I don't care, for all that, though," he whispered, winking at&#xD;
his sister, "if he '11 only le' me go a-fishin'!"&#xD;
"I don't know what we shall do for sinkers,"-- and Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood fumbled in the nail-box. " There an't a bit o' lead in the&#xD;
house, 't I know on.",&#xD;
" There is that 'ere Ticonderoga bullet," suggested Abimelech,&#xD;
meekly.&#xD;
"Yes; and it 's lucky you did n't git holt o' that, when you&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MOUTH OF WILD RIVER.                  9&#xD;
run your pesky cannon ! But I kinder hate to use that. It 's a&#xD;
relic I 'ye ben lottin' on handin' down to futur' generations."&#xD;
Notwithstanding the patriotic" desire, Mr. Jackwood, retiring&#xD;
to the bed-room, opened the till of his chest, and produced the&#xD;
famous bullet.&#xD;
"I expect that 'ere ball killed a man, Bim'lech," he remarked,&#xD;
impressively, balancing the relic on the palm of his hand. " Your&#xD;
Uncle Dani'l picked it out of a skull, to Ticonderoga. The heft&#xD;
on 't can't be much short of a ounce ; an' what a story it could&#xD;
tell, childern, if it could only talk !"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood earnestly counselled her husband against sacri-&#xD;
ficing so precious a memento of Revolutionary times. But, having&#xD;
duly weighed it in his hand, and found it lighter than the present&#xD;
necessity, he submitted it to the hammer, pounded it out flat on&#xD;
the door-stone, and proceeded to the manufacture of sinkers.&#xD;
Abimelech's industry that afternoon excited the surprise and&#xD;
admiration of all who witnessed it. He hoed potatoes -to use&#xD;
his father's expression --"like a major."  The anticipation of&#xD;
piscatory sport inspired him ; the stint was speedily accom-&#xD;
plished ; and just as the noisy old kitchen clock was striking&#xD;
three, father and son might have been seen passing through the&#xD;
door-yard gate, with their fish-poles on their shoulders.&#xD;
Huntersford Creek, a broad, clear-running stream, swept through&#xD;
the valley within a stone's throw of Mr. Jackwood's house; and&#xD;
far to the north the fringing willows on its banks, and graceful&#xD;
elm-trees stationed here and there, marked its winding course.&#xD;
One mile below, Wild River, dashing -down from the mountains&#xD;
like a savage bridegroom, hastened to the embrace of the more&#xD;
gentle stream.  But the coy creek eluded the approach of her&#xD;
impetuous wooer, in a hundred coquettish curves, --now advanc-&#xD;
ing softly to meet him, or moving on serenely by his side, sooth-&#xD;
ing and taming him with song ; then, when almost within his&#xD;
reach, turning suddenly aside, and leading him a long and tortuous~&#xD;
chase through the green meadows; until, driven to the verge of&#xD;
S     the interval, beneath the brow of a mountain tht stood like a.&#xD;
solemn priest, blessing the union, the. fair fugitive yielded, and&#xD;
they twain became one stream.&#xD;

&#xD;
10             THE MOUTH of WILD RIVER.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood professed an acquaintance with the geography&#xD;
of this region, which he proposed to explore. Abimelech, elated&#xD;
with the idea, trotted along by his father's side, carrying his fish-&#xD;
pole jauntily, and chattering incessantly.&#xD;
" Here is a lesson for ye, Bim'lech," said his father, as. they&#xD;
reached the vicinity of the river, pointing to an' old-fashioned,&#xD;
dilapidated house, in a wild-looking yard by the road-side.&#xD;
" This used to be the fust best farm on the interval; an' the man&#xD;
't lives here bid fair to be the richest man in the county. Fif-&#xD;
teen year' ago, where you see all them beds o' gravel an' rocks,&#xD;
there was about the han'somest field of corn 't I ever set eyes on.&#xD;
Wal, it got along to'ards the last of August, and the corn prom-&#xD;
ised to turn out nobly ; everybody was praisin' on 't, an' Mr.&#xD;
Hoodlett made his brags on 't, tellin' about the great crop he was&#xD;
goin' to have, till it seemed to me su'thin' must happen to that&#xD;
corn. So, one day, when I was passin' by, I spoke to Hoodlett.&#xD;
Says I, ' Hoodlett,' says I, ' what if your corn should turn out&#xD;
poor, arter all?' says I. ''T an't possible,' says he; 'I know I&#xD;
shall have the biggest crop ever raised on the crick, jes.'s well 's&#xD;
if I'd seen it harvested.' 'Don't be too sure,' says I. ' Man&#xD;
ap'ints, and God disap'ints.' 'I tell ye what,' says he, 'neigh-&#xD;
bor Jackwood,' says he, 'I would n't ask God Almighty to insure&#xD;
me seventy-five bushels to the acre, any way,' says he ; ' I shall&#xD;
have it, an' there 's no gittin' away from 't.' Wal, it was rainin'&#xD;
a little that day ; but it rained harder that night ; an' all the&#xD;
next day, an' the next night, it come down like forty-'leven Dutch&#xD;
pedlers ; an' the next mornin', when Hoodlett looked out o' the&#xD;
winder, there wan't a stalk o' corn, nor a square foot o' corn-fieldt&#xD;
to cure sore eyes with."&#xD;
" What had 'come on't ?"&#xD;
"'T wan't insured, an' 't was gone. Wild River 's a terrible&#xD;
fractious stream, time of freshets, but it never done noth'n' like&#xD;
that 'fore nor sence.  It come down through the Narrers with a&#xD;
roar 't could be heerd miles away.    It overflowed the hull,&#xD;
country 'bout here, an' brought down a grist o' trees an' rocks&#xD;
from the mountains, with more gravel 'n a man could cart away-&#xD;
in a life-time. The corn-field took the wust on 't, an' got sarved&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MOUTH oF WILD RIVER.                 11&#xD;
so bad, 't a stranger would n't a b'lieved, the day arter, that there&#xD;
was ever so much as a road through the tanglements of trees,&#xD;
roots, an' tops, that lay half buried and piled on to each other, all&#xD;
up an' down the river. That was the ruination of Hoodlett. The&#xD;
best part of his land was sp'ilt; an' it looked so much like a judg-&#xD;
ment from Heav'nl, 't he got discouraged, an' has ben runnin' down&#xD;
hill ever sence."&#xD;
The adventurers had by this time reached the bank of the river,&#xD;
which foamed and flashed, and plunged and bubbled, and .shot in&#xD;
swift, green currents amid the great round bowlders that lay scat-&#xD;
tered up and down its bed, while the music of its plashing filled&#xD;
the air.&#xD;
Here they turned aside from the road, passing through a waste&#xD;
and barren field ; climbed a high bank lifted upon a perpendicular&#xD;
wall of rock from the bed of the stream, and entered a thick grove&#xD;
of young trees. Mr. Jackwood went forward with the poles, fol-&#xD;
lowing a path that led along the brink of the precipice. Abime-&#xD;
lech kept behind, sometimes stopping to pick from the young&#xD;
spruces bits of gum, which stuck provokingly in his teeth; or&#xD;
chewing leaves of the bitter hemlock ; or peeling thin ribbons of&#xD;
the silver birch.&#xD;
"Is hemlock p'ison ?" asked the boy,-spitting out some leaves.&#xD;
" P'ison ? -no. What makes you ask that ?"&#xD;
"'Cause I jest happened to think my history-book says Socrates&#xD;
drinked hemlock to kill himself."&#xD;
"0 , wal," replied Mr. Jackwood, "I 've no doubt 't would kill&#xD;
a man, if he should take enough on 't; so would a good many&#xD;
other things."&#xD;
"Socrates must a' took a perty good swig," suggested Bim.&#xD;
".Or perhaps 't was the ground hemlock ; that 's p'ison. But&#xD;
keep still now ; you'll scare all the fish."&#xD;
They reached a ledge which overhung a deep, narrow basin of&#xD;
rock. Beneath them lay the water, clear and cain. Stones, and&#xD;
pebbles, and fishes, could be seen in its transparent depths. Here&#xD;
they threw in their hooks, with tempting baits; they tried alter&#xD;
nately worms and flies ; from the shallow falls, where the singing&#xD;
Water came rushing down from above, to the stony shelves at the&#xD;

THE MOUTH: OF WILD RIVER.&#xD;

12            THE MOUTH OF WILD RIVER.&#xD;
mouth of the basin, where. the crystal sheet burst once more into&#xD;
bubbles and sparkles of foam, they left no spot unvisited by their&#xD;
lines.  But neither perch, nor pickerel, nor trout, could be&#xD;
allured.&#xD;
"What fools they be!" cried the indignant Bim. "I put my&#xD;
hook right up to their mouths, and they don't know enough to&#xD;
swaller it. I don't believe but that we can ketch some of these&#xD;
big fellers with a snare."&#xD;
It seemed possible. Accordingly, a few minutes later, in place&#xD;
of hooks, wide round loops of copper wire went down into the still&#xD;
basin. But now the fish grew suddenly very shy. Through the&#xD;
snares and around them they darted, in a most tantalizing man-&#xD;
ner ; sometimes remaining quiet and watchful until the wire ap-&#xD;
proached within too dangerous proximity of their noses, then&#xD;
shooting away in schools.  Not one could be taken; and after&#xD;
another half-hour's unsuccessful sport, Mr. Jackwood's patience&#xD;
failing him, he reluctantly wound up his lines.&#xD;
"I 'tell ye what, Bim'lech, there 's no use wastin' time in this&#xD;
'ere wretched hole.  We '11 be" sure o' ketchin' suthin' at the&#xD;
mouth of the river."&#xD;
Below the bridge, they. undertook to follow the bed of the&#xD;
stream. For some distance they experienced no difficulty ; they&#xD;
enjoyed excellent advantages for fishing, as they proceeded, with&#xD;
the exception of the simple fact that no fish would bite; but at&#xD;
length the narrow channel to which the stream had shrunk during&#xD;
the dry weather began to ,widen and shift its course, and it&#xD;
became necessary either to leave the river-bed altogether, or&#xD;
cross over to the white fields of dry stones that now made their&#xD;
appearance on the other side.  First they tried the banks; but&#xD;
the tall grass and the strong willows were found serious obstacles&#xD;
in the way of comfortable fishing. Then they attempted to cross&#xD;
the stream on the stones, selecting a shallow place for the execu-&#xD;
tion of the enterprise. But the round bowlders, covered with the&#xD;
scum of dried slime, proved treacherous footholds, rolling and&#xD;
turning on the slippery stones beneath them, and perilling the bal-&#xD;
ance even of' tle careful and sagacious Mr. Jackwood. Abime-&#xD;
lech followed his adventurous parent; when suddenly the latter&#xD;
&#xD;
heard a great splashing behind him, and looked around. The boy&#xD;
was floundering in the water, and endeavoring, in a great panic,&#xD;
to regain a footing on the stones.&#xD;
"Careless !" exclaimed Mr. Jackwood. "There, there, stan'&#xD;
still! The water won't drownd ye; 't an't up to your knees.&#xD;
Now, what need was there o' gittin' in all over?"&#xD;
He was still speaking, when the bowlder on which he imagined&#xD;
himself firmly planted began to revolve. To preserve his balance,&#xD;
he stepped carefully forward ; but the boy had spattered all that&#xD;
side of the rock, and, Mr. Jackwood's foot resting on a spot as&#xD;
slippery as glass, he slid, with a great splash, into the water, bring-&#xD;
ing down the rattling fish-poles, in rather dangerous style, on the&#xD;
crown of Abimelech's head.&#xD;
"0, 0, 0!" screamed t e boy, pitching about once more in&#xD;
the water.&#xD;
"Ketch holt o' my hand!" cried the elder Jackwood. "This&#xD;
all comes o' your wantin' to go a-fishin'! "&#xD;
Bim cried desolately ; and, having reached the dry stones,&#xD;
stood with distended hands and feet, dripping like a newly-&#xD;
washed sheep.&#xD;
" D' I hurt your head?" asked 'his father, touched with&#xD;
remorse.&#xD;
"Ye-e-s !  You mos' broke it !" snuffled Bim.  " 0, you&#xD;
h-u-r-t ! "- as Mr. Jackwood, with paternal solicitude, examined&#xD;
his crown. " It 's bad enough, I should think, to kill a feller,&#xD;
'thout scoldin' him for 't afterwards."&#xD;
" Don't talk so !" said his father, sternly. " Ye an't hurt much,&#xD;
I guess, arter all the fuss."&#xD;
" Yes I be, too !" whined Abimelech, holding his head in his&#xD;
hands. "You'd think so, if you 'd ben knocked over with a&#xD;
couple o' thunderin' great poles."&#xD;
"There, don't swear ! I guess now we '1l go hum; we 've had&#xD;
about sport enough. for one day."&#xD;
The injured Bim became suddenly pacified.&#xD;
"I don't want. ter go hum,"-giving his crown a final rub,&#xD;
and putting on his straw hat. "I can get dry in a little while.&#xD;
My head feels better now."&#xD;

14             THE MOUTH OF WILD RIVER.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood sat down and emptied the water out of his boots.&#xD;
His hopeful heir followed his example; and afterwards divested&#xD;
himself of his trousers, in order to wring them out and hang them&#xD;
on the bushes to dry. Then, in a light and picturesque costume,&#xD;
he went hopping about on the stones, with his fishing apparatus,&#xD;
and caught a fine brace of trout during the ensuing half-hour.&#xD;
"I declare," said his father, "if you don't beat the Dutch ! I&#xD;
han't had a nibble yit."&#xD;
"0, my !" cried the excited boy, leaping recklessly upon an&#xD;
unstable stone, " there is a smashin' big feller ! "&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood thought it must be indeed a "smashin' big fel-&#xD;
ler,"from the great commotion of waters. He looked up, and&#xD;
saw an object flouncing in the river like a young whale. It was&#xD;
Abimelech, however, not the fish.&#xD;
" So you thought you 'd jump in arter him, did you?  You 're&#xD;
a smart boy!"&#xD;
Abimelech's second ducking had been more thorough and exten-&#xD;
sive than the first ; so that, by the time his trousers were dry&#xD;
enough to put on, his shirt was in a capital condition to go upon&#xD;
the bushes in their place. But the charm was now broken ; no.&#xD;
more luck had he ; so he hastened to tie his freshly-washed gar-&#xD;
ment to his fish-pole, and, waving it in the air like a banner, fol-&#xD;
lowed his father down the river.&#xD;
In consequence of recent freshets, the river had changed its bed&#xD;
a dozen times; the valley appeared ploughed up with ravines,&#xD;
which branched out in every direction.  The dry fields of stones&#xD;
had disappeared ; the stream became sluggish and dark, creeping&#xD;
over the black ooze of the interval; and the, grass on the banks&#xD;
now grew so thick, and rank, and high, that 4the boy became&#xD;
disheartened.&#xD;
"I can't go no further ! " he complained. "There 's brakes,&#xD;
an' nettles, an' everything to bother a feller.  I 'm afraid o'&#xD;
snakes."&#xD;
" Keep up good pluck ! " cried his father. "Here 's the crick,&#xD;
close by."&#xD;
What was taken for the creek proved to be an old bed, with a&#xD;
black and shining pool of dead water fast asleep in it, between&#xD;
&#xD;
4~&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MOUTH of WILD. RIVER.                15&#xD;
crumbling banks. To go around it was a labor replete with pain&#xD;
and difficulty. It led over flats full of dangerous sloughs; then&#xD;
other such pools appeared, in the midst of which our adventurers&#xD;
became confused.  Sometimes they mistook the river for the&#xD;
creek ; more than once they mistook the creek for the river; and&#xD;
finally there appeared to be numberless.rivers and creeks winding&#xD;
in every direction.&#xD;
" There ! " cried Mr. Jackwood, at length, "there's the creek,&#xD;
this time, 't any rate. We 'll fnd it nuff easier goin' on t' other&#xD;
side to pay for crossin' over ; then we can go up to Dunbery's old&#xD;
bridge, an' so hum. It 's go'n' to rain ; an' I don't see any gre't&#xD;
chance for fishin' here, arter all."&#xD;
' But we can't cross here !" whined the disappointed Abime-&#xD;
lech ; "the water 's a mile deep."&#xD;
It was a broad channel, filled with clear, still water, in the&#xD;
depths of which could be seen great shining logs, lying tangled&#xD;
and crossed on the black mud of the interval.&#xD;
"What a boy you be to stretch a story! " exclaimed Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood. "Here is a good place to ford."&#xD;
He rolled up his trousers above his knees, and carried Abime-&#xD;
lech over on his back ; when, reaching the opposite bank, he sat&#xD;
down to pulU on his boots, which the boy had brought over in his&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
"Where 's my stockin's ?" - thrusting his hand down one of&#xD;
the legs.&#xD;
"I d'n' know; I han't seen 'em," replied the boy.&#xD;
"You don' know ! Why don't you know? I told you to take&#xD;
care on 'em."&#xD;
"I guess you laid 'em down on t' other side."&#xD;
"An' I got to go back arter 'em! I wish you 'd lam  to keep&#xD;
your wits about ye!"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood arose, and, rolling up his trousers again, although&#xD;
the water-mark was some inches above their utmost elevation, re-&#xD;
turned to the opposite bank. But no socks were to be found.&#xD;
"You let 'em drop in the water, sartin as the world!" he&#xD;
exclaimed, giving up the search. Abimelech protested against&#xD;
the injustice of this charge. "0, you 're a terrible innocent&#xD;

" Now, what's to pay, I wonder? What ye ben puttin' in this&#xD;
boot? "&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood withdrew his foot, put in his hand, and extracted&#xD;
a stocking.&#xD;
"If it don't beat all! I remember, now, I did tuck 'em in&#xD;
my boots; an' they 're so wet they dropped clean down into the&#xD;
toes."&#xD;
"KBlame me, will ye, next time ! " muttered Bim' "0, 'f course&#xD;
I lost 'em in the river !"&#xD;
"Is that the way to talk to your father ? " asked Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood, solemnly. "You better be careful!&#xD;
Abimelech continued to mutter; but, his father suggesting sig-&#xD;
nificantly that he'd do well to wait till he got his boots on, he&#xD;
hushed, and contented himself with looking sullen. Resuming&#xD;
their tramp, they had not proceeded far, when he began to grum-&#xD;
ble again, very faintly.&#xD;
" What 's that.?" cried his father, sharply, looking around.&#xD;
" I could a' ketched 'nough fish, if you 'd le' me staid where I&#xD;
was. Might a' know'd we could n't do nothin' down here."&#xD;
"Where's the fish you did ketch ?"&#xD;
d'n' know! -I guess I -I left 'em on the ground where&#xD;
you put your boots on ! " - beginning to cry.&#xD;
" Wal, wal, never mind," said Mr. Jackwood ; "'t won't take&#xD;
long to go back arter 'enm. Cheer up, an' I '11 go on an' see what&#xD;
them bushes look like, ahead here."&#xD;
Ten minutes later, Mr. Jackwood-shouted.&#xD;
" Hurrah, Bim'lech! where be ye?"&#xD;
" I can't find my fish!" cried the boy ; " somebody's come an'&#xD;
stole 'em! "&#xD;
At that moment there was a vivid flash of lightning, which lit&#xD;
up the entire canopy of the sky, and a heavy drop plashed upon&#xD;
Abimelech's hand. He had explored the bank in vain; while all&#xD;
the time the little willow bough, on which the fish were strung&#xD;
eeped out of the trampled grass before his eyes. Agitated and&#xD;
blind with tears, he could not see it; and now, in a panic of fear&#xD;
abandoning the search, he attempted to return to his father.&#xD;
&#xD;
TH   MOUTH OF WILD RIVER.                17&#xD;
" Here !" shouted Mr. Jackwood, sending up his hat on the end&#xD;
of a pole as a signal, " do ye see this?"&#xD;
Thrusting the pole into the ground, he was on the point of going&#xD;
in pursuit of the boy, when his attention was attracted by a cry in&#xD;
another direction. He paused and hallooed. The cry was repeated.&#xD;
It sounded like that of some person in distress. Leaving Abime-&#xD;
lech, therefore, to make the best of his way out of the grass, Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood advanced upon the rotting timber of a bridge thrown&#xD;
across the creek.&#xD;
Beyond was an old barn, that stood half hidden by the willows&#xD;
and young elms, festooned with vines, that grew by the stream ;&#xD;
and as the voice sounded in that direction, he kept on, until there&#xD;
arose suddenly before him out of the grass what seemed the bent&#xD;
form of an old woman, leaning upon a staff.&#xD;
"It's some plaguy old witch or anotherr !" he muttered to him-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
She attempted to approach him, whereupon he made a deferen-&#xD;
tial step backwards towards the bridge. Mr. Jackwood had his&#xD;
own opinions about witches.&#xD;
0, sir, if you will be so kind as to help me!" she faltered,&#xD;
sinking down again in the tangled grass.&#xD;
Wal, I an't a man to pass by on t' other side when there's&#xD;
suff'rin' in the way," said Mr. Jackwood, approaching; "though&#xD;
I'm a little grain skittish about stragglers. What 'pears to be&#xD;
the matter, hey?"&#xD;
"I have lost my way," answered the woman, faintly, resting&#xD;
.   her head upon her hand, "and I can go no further."&#xD;
"Tuckered out, hey ?  Wal, that 's bad! But you can man-&#xD;
Sag'e to git up to the road, can't ye?"&#xD;
The woman replied that she was too much exhausted to walk.&#xD;
"iHoity-toity !" cried Mr. Jackwood, cheerily. "This'll never&#xD;
do. Where there 's life there 's hope., Only think you can, and&#xD;
you can, you know. B'sides, mebby I can help.    You won't&#xD;
be sorry; you '11 find a warm supper an' a good comf'table shelter&#xD;
some'eres, I promise ye."&#xD;
He extended his hand: the woman clasped it convulsively.&#xD;

"You will be my friend !" she articulated, with strange vehe-&#xD;
mence - "something tells me that I can trust you!"&#xD;
"My name 's Jackwood; I live on the crick,, jest above here.&#xD;
Everybody knows Bim'lech Jackwood," replied the farmer.&#xD;
"You are my only hope," said the woman, "and I will have&#xD;
faith that you have been sent to me."&#xD;
" I like that; that 'ere sounds han'some an' pious. But seems&#xD;
to me you don't 'pear quite so old as I took you to be at fust."&#xD;
" I am not old. I have been obliged to appear so for safety.&#xD;
You will-not betray me !"&#xD;
"Don't be afeared," exclaimed Mr. Jackwood, with hearty&#xD;
sympathy.&#xD;
" Let me appear to you as I am, then."  And the stranger&#xD;
removed a pair of spectacles that concealed her eyes; took off the&#xD;
bonnet that almost covered her face; put back from her forehead&#xD;
the old-woman's cap, with its wig of gray hair attached, and dis-&#xD;
covered thick masses of dark hair loosened and falling down her&#xD;
neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
II.&#xD;
THE STRANGER AND THE STORM.&#xD;
MR. JACKWOOD stood astonished. Such eyes - such wonder-&#xD;
fully soft and lustrous eyes - he had never seen before.&#xD;
"Why, do tell, now ! I never had anything come over me so,&#xD;
in all my born days ! Then them 'ere marks on your face t' look&#xD;
like wrinkles an't nat'ral, hey?"&#xD;
"I will go to the water and wash them off," replied the stranger.&#xD;
" But do not question me, nor ever speak of this."&#xD;
At that juncture Abimelech was heard screaming frantically.&#xD;
"I shall haf to go for that-boy, sartin 's the world !" exclaimed&#xD;
the farmer. "How do ye feel now ? Think you can walk a&#xD;
hunderd rods or so ?"&#xD;
"You have given me hope," said the wanderer; "and hope&#xD;
gives life and strength ! "&#xD;
"That's more like it ! that's the way to talk ! I_ shouldn't&#xD;
wonder if we git h~oine now 'fore it rains, to speak of. Only, when&#xD;
you 've washed, if you'll make an effort and creep along slow, -&#xD;
this 'ere 's the track, ye know; keep where the grass is thin,--&#xD;
it 'll give Bim'lech an' me a chance, an' we 'll overtake you 'fore&#xD;
you git fur."&#xD;
And so, with a parting word of cheer, Mr. Jackwood disap-&#xD;
peared behind the elms. Left alone, the girl made haste tot wash&#xD;
her hands and face; then, having thrown away her staff, and care-&#xD;
fully concealed the wig, cap, and spectacles, about her person, she&#xD;
resumed the old bonnet, which corresponded well with the rest of&#xD;
her attire, and set out to walk slowly along the track indicated by&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
Abimelech's voice meanwhile grew fainter and fainter; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8115-00000011"/>&#xD;
20          THE STRANGER AND THE STORM.&#xD;
after a baffling search, his father found him sunk to his knees in&#xD;
the black mud of a slough. Taking him by the arm, he dragged&#xD;
him out, shouldered him, and carried him off bodily.&#xD;
"Hush up ! hush up ! You an't dead, arter all. You can't&#xD;
guess what I have found, out here... It 's suthin' better 'n two&#xD;
little mis'ble trout."&#xD;
"Is'It a otter?" asked the boy, with a sudden lull in his lam-&#xD;
entations.&#xD;
" You'll see, you '11 see. Don't say nothin', but laugh."&#xD;
Reaching the bridge, Mr. Jackwood set him on his feet, shoul-&#xD;
dered the fish-poles in his place, and, walking on, pointed out the&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
" That 's the way you alluz fool me! I thought you 'd got&#xD;
suthin'! Heugh! a woman! an' a beggar woman, too "&#xD;
" Stop that.! " cried Mr. Jackwood. "You talk like a young&#xD;
heathen. An't we commanded to help the needy?  What's the&#xD;
use o' your going' to Sunday-school, I 'd like to know ?"&#xD;
" Who is she, any way?"&#xD;
" Hush !" with a significant motion of the hand. "Hem !"&#xD;
coughed the farmer, preparatory to addressing the stranger.-&#xD;
"Keep a little back, Bim'lech ! - Hem! you 'pear to be doin'&#xD;
perty well; feel better, don't ye ?  If you should take my arm,&#xD;
now, I guess we '11 be able to git along finely.",&#xD;
With a word of thanks, feebly spoken, the stranger accepted&#xD;
the offer, -and need enough there seemed that he should assist&#xD;
her weary footsteps. She turned upon him, as she did so, the&#xD;
light of those wonderful eyes, and smiled a grateful smile, which&#xD;
seemed to struggle against embarrassment and fatigue.&#xD;
"Did you come from-the north?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir," she faltered, - " I mean no, sir. I came, I think,&#xD;
from that direction," -pointing directly at the old Bear Back,&#xD;
the highest and most rugged of the western range of mountains,&#xD;
that bounded the valley. "I followed a road till I lost it in the&#xD;
woods, then I tried to cross the valley."&#xD;
" You hollered that 'ere road?  You was traveling' north,&#xD;
.then ?I"&#xD;
" I am a little confused ;, I hardly know what I tell you."&#xD;
&#xD;
TUE STRANGER AND THE STORM.                21&#xD;
" Turned 'round, be ye ?  Wal, I don't wonder at that. So I&#xD;
shan't ax you no questions. I 'd like to inquire, though, if&#xD;
your parents live down north, here."&#xD;
"tMy parents?" said the girl, with an effort; "I -I have&#xD;
lost them !"&#xD;
" 0, they 're dead, then ! I an't none o' the pryin' -sort, but&#xD;
I should like to know if their names was Carter. Perhaps I&#xD;
know'd 'em. That was n't the name, hey?  Wal, I an't goin' to&#xD;
ax questions; but seems to me I've seen you som'eres. Is your&#xD;
name Burbank?"&#xD;
"No, sir; and I was never in this part of the country before."&#xD;
"You 're a native o' York State, then, I conclude? No 7&#xD;
Mebby, then, you've ben to work in the factories, down to Lowell&#xD;
an' Lawrence. I've got a darter 't 's talked some o' tryin' her&#xD;
hand at that business; she would, in a minute, if I 'd let her.&#xD;
No? Wal, never mind,    I an't one o' the pryin' sort. I forgit,&#xD;
though, what you said your name was."&#xD;
"Say, father," interrupted Abimelech, at this important crisis,&#xD;
"the rain's coming' like great guns ! You can't see the old Bear&#xD;
Back!"&#xD;
"I guess we'll hurry on a leetle grain faster, if you an't too&#xD;
tired, Miss ---  I don't remember your name," said Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood.&#xD;
"I never heerd the mountain roar so in all my life!" cried the&#xD;
excited Bim. "Do look, father ! how the trees thrash about!&#xD;
See 'em! see 'em! all over the mountain! How dark it grows!"&#xD;
" We shall have it here in a minute," said Mr. Jackwood. "A&#xD;
leetle grain faster, if you can 's .well's not, Miss --- iDid I&#xD;
understand you to say your name was--"&#xD;
At that moment, a swift squad of the storm, charging down&#xD;
from the mountain with volleys of arrowy rain, swept over'our&#xD;
little party. The elm-trees trembled, and reeled, and tossed their&#xD;
long green hair, while the tall grass of the interval rose and fell,&#xD;
and whirled in eddies, like a sea.&#xD;
"There goes my hat!" screamed Abimelech.&#xD;
It lodged in the grass, and his father' caught it with his fish.&#xD;
pole.&#xD;

22          THE STRANGER AND THE STORM.&#xD;
The boy sprang to seize it, and pulled it on his head with such&#xD;
desperation as to tear away the rim, and leave a liberal rent for&#xD;
his hair to flutter through; and thus, with the appearance of hold-&#xD;
ing himself down by the ears, he scudded on before the gale. His&#xD;
companions followed more slowly ; the stranger, in fluttering&#xD;
attire, clinging to her friend, and Mr. Jackwood, looking solid and&#xD;
responsible under his burden, snuffing the squall complacently, and&#xD;
dragging the fish-poles after.&#xD;

THE FARM-HOUSE.&#xD;
THOROUGHLY drenched, the little party arrived at the farm-&#xD;
house.&#xD;
" Why ! my sakes!" cried Mrs. Jackwood, as the kitchen door&#xD;
flew open, and they came in with the lashing rain, -" I never&#xD;
see! iDo shet the door quick, Bim'leoh!  Is this 'Tildy Fos-&#xD;
dick?"&#xD;
In the gloom, she mistook her husband's companion for one of&#xD;
the neighbors. Mr. Jackwood corrected the error.&#xD;
" La, wal ! I s'pose we can keep her one night, 't any rate,"&#xD;
said his wife. " Soppin' wet, an't ye?  Be ye 'fraid o' ketchin'&#xD;
cold?"&#xD;
No, I don't think of that," answered the girl, shiveringly.&#xD;
Wal, come to the stove, an'. warm ye; " and Mrs. Jackwood&#xD;
drew up the high-backed rocking-chair. "Set here.-Phoebe,&#xD;
put in some more wood. I s'pose I might let you have one o' my&#xD;
ol' gowns to put on: I guess I better. You don't look very&#xD;
tough. I'll take your wet bunnit."&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood hung the, drenched article upon a peg ; then,&#xD;
having lighted a candle with a coal she took from the fire, she&#xD;
turned once more to the stranger.&#xD;
"Dear me ! "-betraying a lively emotion, - "you can't stub-&#xD;
bid, be ye ? You don't look fit to be trav'lin' in this W'ay!&#xD;
Whereabouts is yer home?"&#xD;
The girl appeared to make an effort to speak.&#xD;
"Don't be axin' questions, mother!" spoke up Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
"You see," he added, considerately, in an under tone, "it hurts her&#xD;
feelin's.-I shall have to git ye to speak yer name once more,&#xD;
if ye please."&#xD;

24                   THE FARM-HOUSE.&#xD;
" Charlotte Woods," articulated the stranger.&#xD;
" Cha'lotte Woods," repeated the farmer, with an air of&#xD;
thoughtful interest.-"Go 'way, Phoebe,"-in a whisper; "don't&#xD;
stan' starin' at her !- There 's a Woods under the mountain; is&#xD;
he any relation ?"&#xD;
The girl shook her head. $he was apparently seventeen or&#xD;
eighteen years of age; but her features, of delicate mould,&#xD;
and of a soft, brunette complexion, bordering upon the olive,&#xD;
showed traces of passion and suffering rarely seen in one so young.&#xD;
Her eyes were tremulously downcast, and her slender hands&#xD;
clasped across her lap in an attitude of intense emotion. The&#xD;
contrast of her humble drenched attire and the yellow lamp-light&#xD;
that fell upon it served to heighten the effect of the scene. It&#xD;
was at once picturesque and touching. Not even the uncultivated&#xD;
inmates of the Jackwood dwelling were insensible to it; and a&#xD;
respectful hush followed the farmer's last question, all eyes ap-&#xD;
pearing to regard the unknown guest with mingled solicitude and&#xD;
deference.&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood broke the silence. "Shall I give you that dry&#xD;
gown to put on?"&#xD;
"Thank you," said the stranger, "I am quite comfortable."&#xD;
"Give her a drop o' that 'ere currant wine," whispered the&#xD;
farmer.&#xD;
"Where's all yer fish?" Mrs. Jackwood at last thought to&#xD;
inquire. "The cat 'll eat 'em up, if they 're under the stoop."&#xD;
" I guess all we brought home won't hurt her, if she eats bones&#xD;
an' all," said Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
" Why, did n't ye ketch none?"&#xD;
" I ketched two trout, real nice ones, an' lost 'em," snivelled&#xD;
Bim, in the corner.&#xD;
"What ye cryin' about ?"&#xD;
"I tore my knee all open ! I was runnin' on ahead, an' fell&#xD;
down, right on to a great rock."-&#xD;
" Wal, wal, you '11 feel better arter supper," said his father.&#xD;
".You need n't help about the chores to-night. You 'ye had aA&#xD;
perty hard time on 't, this arternoon, that 's a fact. You Won't&#xD;
want to go a-fishin' agin very soon, will ye ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FARM-ROUSE.                    25&#xD;
"I don't want to go to Wild River !" mumbled the aggrieved&#xD;
Bim. "They 're the meanest fish !  My fast two nibbles was&#xD;
bites, then all my other bites was nibbles."&#xD;
Meanwhile supper was waiting, only the tea j as to be drawn;&#xD;
and Mr. Jackwood proposed that they should ' set right down."&#xD;
But the stranger felt too faint to think of food.&#xD;
"Wal," said Mr. Jackwood, after a moment's reflection, "I&#xD;
guess I '11 go an' milk, then, an' have the chores done up 'fore&#xD;
supper. If you git ready to se' down, don't wait for me."&#xD;
He took the rattling milk-pails from the pantry, and went out&#xD;
in the darkness and. storm, to finish the labors of the day. He&#xD;
fed the squealing pigs, and stopped their noise ; gave the bleating&#xD;
calves their suppers ; drove the sheep out of the door-yard; and&#xD;
returned, at length, to the kitchen, bearing two brimming pails of&#xD;
milk - and rain-water.&#xD;
He found his guest still sitting by the stove, reposing languidly&#xD;
in the high-backed chair ; having, in the mean time, however, put&#xD;
on dry apparel, for which she was indebted to Mrs. Jackwood's&#xD;
kindness.&#xD;
"Wal, how d'ye find yourself arter your shower-bath?" he&#xD;
inquired, cheerily. " Think ye can eat a little supper, now?&#xD;
Can, hey ?  That's right; turn right 'round here. Come, Phoebe,&#xD;
- Bim'lech, what ye waitin' far ? Where '11 she set, mother?"&#xD;
"She can set in Bim'lech's place; he's had his supper. He&#xD;
was so hungry, he could n't wait ; so he took a bowl o' bread-an'-&#xD;
milk in his hand."&#xD;
"I did n't eat enough! .That was nothin' but a luncheon.&#xD;
"What ! that great bowl o' bread-an'-milk ? I wonder what&#xD;
your stomach is made of ! "&#xD;
" Never mind ; let him come to the table, if he wants to," said&#xD;
, 4v Mr. Jackwood, whose heart grew big and warm in the glows of&#xD;
, the homely old kitchen. " There 's plenty o' room.  Fix him a&#xD;
place, Phobe. I don't see the need of anybody 's starvin' in my&#xD;
$house."&#xD;
Mrs. Jack wood, getting a plate : " It 's all foolishness eat'n' two&#xD;
suppers'--one jest 'fore goin' to bed, too; that 's all I care&#xD;
' about it."&#xD;

THE FARM-HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Bim thinks he deserves two suppers, for bringing home so&#xD;
many fish ! " said Phoebe.&#xD;
Abimelech, ex asperated: "Make her stop, father  I should&#xD;
think she 'd said enough about that ! "&#xD;
" There, there, there, children, don't quarrel ! What makes ye&#xD;
want to pester him so, Phoebe ?  You should n't mind it, my son;&#xD;
you should be above sich things. There's a plate for ye;' bring&#xD;
yer chair along. Hush, now."&#xD;
The farmer-said grace in the stereotype phrase of years ; but&#xD;
an allusion to the wanderer beneath his roof, and the wind and&#xD;
the rain without, - awkwardly interpolated, it is true, yet spoken&#xD;
with simple earnestness, -rendered the prayer vital and touch-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"Bim kept making faces at me all the time you was asking the&#xD;
blessing !" said Phoebe.&#xD;
"Bim'lech, did you do that 'ere ? " asked Mr. Jackwood,&#xD;
solemnly.&#xD;
Abimelech, with an air of innocence : " No, I did n't! There&#xD;
was a 'skeeter buzzin' 'round my face, an' I squinted to scare him&#xD;
away, that 's all. If she had n't ben lookin' she would n't 'a&#xD;
seen me."&#xD;
Phoebe: "What a story ! There an't a mosquito in the&#xD;
house ! " .*&#xD;
"That '11 do ! Don't le' me hear no more complaints. We've&#xD;
got plain fare," - the farmer turned to his guest, -" but it 's&#xD;
hulsome.  Here 's good ho'-made bread, an' sweet butter, an'&#xD;
fresh milk ; some dried beef, too, if ye like ; an' mother '11 give&#xD;
ye a good stiff cup o' tea, to raise yer sperrits. Then there 's a&#xD;
pie I'll ventur' to recommend, bime-by."&#xD;
"Mother ! I -want - a --piece - of ---pie!"&#xD;
" You need n't whine so like a great baby, if you do ! You may&#xD;
give him a piece, Phoebe."&#xD;
"Phoeb' need n't be so p'tic'lar to pick out the smallest&#xD;
piece!  I '11 have two pieces, now, see if I don't ! May n't&#xD;
I, father ?"&#xD;
"Eat that fust, then we'll see."&#xD;
" I want some cheese with it ! Come, you need n't help me,&#xD;

&#xD;
THE FARM-HOUSE.                     27&#xD;
Phoeb'! Jest pass the plate, an' le' me help myself. How darned&#xD;
generous you be ! "&#xD;
- "Bim'lech!"&#xD;
"What!"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood, severely: "Le' me hear any more sich talk, an'&#xD;
you '11 go right away from the table, -mind now !"&#xD;
The boy muttered something in self-defence, with his mouth&#xD;
full; but his father's attention was at that moment drawn to his&#xD;
guest. For some time she had been vainly endeavoring to eat.&#xD;
The bounty spread before her, the kindness of her new friends,&#xD;
and the thought of rest and shelter while the storm raged without,&#xD;
filled her heart to suffocating fulness; and, too weak to control her&#xD;
emotions, but instincetively seeking to conceal then, she attempted&#xD;
to rise from the table. The pallor and distress of her features,&#xD;
and the strangeness of her movements, alarmed the farmer; but,&#xD;
before he could speak, a sudden dizziness seized her, and she sank&#xD;
insensible upon the floor.&#xD;
"Marcy !" exclaimed Mrs. Jackwood, starting from the table.&#xD;
'I believe she 's fainted !  Hold her, father, while I bring the&#xD;
campfire "&#xD;
In her agitation, mistaking the loaf of bread-for the lamp, she&#xD;
rushed with it into the pantry, and began to search in the dark&#xD;
for the camphor, -knocking over two or three bottles in the&#xD;
operation, and laying her hand on the right one at the precise&#xD;
moment when it was no longer needed.&#xD;
At the same time, Phoebe hastened to pour some hot water out&#xD;
of the tea-kettle, with what object in view, she was never very&#xD;
well able to explain.  She poured it into the cullender, which&#xD;
happened to be the first utensil in her reach;- and the cullender&#xD;
acting like a sieve, sprinkled it in a plentiful shower upon her&#xD;
foot. In consequence of this catastrophe, she was nervously eccu-&#xD;
pied in ascertaining the extent of her bu-ns, while Mr. Jackwood&#xD;
was thus left alone to support the form of L .'e fainting girl.&#xD;
"A cup o' water ! " he cried, lifting her to the chair. "Don't&#xD;
bescart, boy.  She '11 come to, carter a little sprinkling .  Be&#xD;
quick !"&#xD;
A    Abimelech heard only " cup, sprinkle, quick," and, actuated by&#xD;

28                  THE FARM-HOUSE.&#xD;
the same benevolence of impulse which had set his mother rattling&#xD;
the bottles, and his sister pouring hot water, he seized the milk-&#xD;
cup from the tea-tray, and spilled its contents partly in the strang-&#xD;
er's hair, partly in her left ear.&#xD;
"Not that !" ejaculated his father. "Don't you know noth-&#xD;
in' '?Water ! "&#xD;
Thereupon the boy caught up one of the empty milk-pails, and,&#xD;
hastening to the sink-room, commenced pumping violently.&#xD;
By this time the swooning girl began to revive. Indeed, her&#xD;
consciousness had at no time been entirely lost. Her soul had&#xD;
seemed sinking, sinking, like a candle let down into the dark of a-&#xD;
deep well; and in a still place, gleaming with a faint ray, just above&#xD;
the waters of oblivion, it had waited, as it were, to be drawn up.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood's care was now to wipe away the milk which&#xD;
streaked her hair, and cheek, and neck. Accidentally disarrang-&#xD;
ing her dress in the operation, he started back with an involuntary&#xD;
exclamation of pain and pity. Her full throat was exposed, and&#xD;
just below it, in startling contrast with her soft and gentle beauty,&#xD;
appeared a sharp cut, as of a -pointed blade.  The wound was&#xD;
evidently not so new but it might have been partially healed ;&#xD;
some recent hurt, however,-- perhaps the fall froip the chair,.-&#xD;
had opened it afresh, and now a fine crimson stream was traced&#xD;
upon her breast.&#xD;
With a quick, instinctive movement, she covered the wound&#xD;
from sight.&#xD;
" It 's nothing; a little hurt," -clasping her hand over her&#xD;
breast.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood was speechless with embarrassment ; but the cry&#xD;
which had escaped his lips, alarming the family, brought them&#xD;
simultaneously to his relief. Mrs. Jackwood appeared with her&#xD;
camphor-bottle, shaking it up, with her hand over the nose; Phoebe&#xD;
ran up, with a shoe in one hand and the cullender in the other ;&#xD;
while Abimelech stagg :red in from the sink-room, swinging a full&#xD;
pail of milky water.&#xD;
" There, there, mother !" cried Mr. Jackwood, as his wife began&#xD;
to bathe the patient's forehead; " that '11 do; it '11 only be unpleas-&#xD;
ant to her."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FARM-HOUSE.29&#xD;
"'T won't do no harm," replied the good woman, applying the&#xD;
camphor to the sufferer's nose. "How do you feel now?"&#xD;
"Better, - quite well," gasped the poor girl, pushing the bottle&#xD;
feebly away.&#xD;
" Look at Bim !" exclaimed the excited Phoebe. "What are&#xD;
you going to do with that water ?"&#xD;
"Father told me to!" cried Bim. "What you goin'to do with&#xD;
the cullender 7 You need n't say nothin'!"&#xD;
" Open yer eyes, if it 's as convenient as not," suggested Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood ; " I want to see how you look."&#xD;
The stranger's eyes partly opened, but closed again heavily.&#xD;
"'My eyelids are stiff," she said, with an expression of pain.&#xD;
"Pat some butter on to 'em=-that'll limber 'em," whispered&#xD;
the boy, hoarsely, in his father's ear. "Say, shall I?"&#xD;
"Git away with yer nonsense ! ".said Mr. Jackwood, with a&#xD;
threatening gesture.&#xD;
Abimelech recoiled, and sat down, with a startling splash, in the&#xD;
pail of water he had left standing on the floor.&#xD;
"Now what? " said Mrs. Jackwood, sharply.&#xD;
"Good enough for him!" exclaimed Phoebe. "He need n't&#xD;
have left the water standing right there in the way. Now bellow,&#xD;
great baby!"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood commanded silence. "She 's got a dre'ful bad&#xD;
hurt on her breast !" he whispered to his wife; "an' I think he'd&#xD;
better have suthin' done for 't."&#xD;
"It 's not much," said the guest. "If I can be a little while&#xD;
alone&#xD;
"Take her into your room, mother."&#xD;
Still holding her hand upon her breast, the sufferer arose, and&#xD;
with Mrs. Jackwood's assistance, reached the adjoining room&#xD;
Becoming faint again, she sat down, and, after some hesitation,&#xD;
suffered the good woman to look at her wound.&#xD;
"Marcy me, if 't an't a cut ! It bleeds a stream ! Poor thing!&#xD;
- how did you git hurt so?"&#xD;
" I- --itwas -an accident."&#xD;
."It looks as though you had been stabbed with a knife! Phobe,&#xD;
bring me a basin o' water, an' be quick!"&#xD;

" Cold water ?" cried Phoebe.&#xD;
Pour in out o' the tea-kittle jest enough to take off the chill,"&#xD;
said her mother. "Don't be all night about it!"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood hastened to a tall bureau in the corner, and took&#xD;
from it some linen for the wound.&#xD;
" What did ye ever have done for 't ?" she asked, getting down&#xD;
again beside the guest.&#xD;
"I can't tell, -not much."&#xD;
" Did n't you never have no healin' plaster on 't, nor nothing "&#xD;
She moved her head feebly, with a negative sign.&#xD;
" I want to know ! Why did n't ye ?  Poor child ! you must&#xD;
a' suffered from it. How long sence 't was hurt ? "&#xD;
" 0 dear ! " exclaimed Phoebe, in dolorous accents, approaching&#xD;
behind her mother. '"tWhat is it ?  Don't it most kill you ? "-&#xD;
The basin began to tip in her hands. "It makes me dizzy to look&#xD;
at it-!"&#xD;
"What are ye doin' ?" cried her mother, looking suddenly&#xD;
around, in her kneeling posture. " I never ! if you an't spillin'&#xD;
that water all down my back !"&#xD;
"I could n't help it. I come perty near faintin' ! "&#xD;
"Se' down the basin, and go out and shet the door. Do ye&#xD;
hear?"&#xD;
Phoebe placed the basin upon a chair, and reluctantly with.&#xD;

Having dressed the wound according to her own ideas of such&#xD;
things, Mrs. Jackwood returned to the kitchen.&#xD;
" How is she ?" asked Phoebe.&#xD;
"She's jest lopped down on my bed for a little while. Finish&#xD;
yer suppers, childern; I'll 'tend to her. I'm going' to have her&#xD;
drink a strong cup o' tea, as soon as she gits over her faint spell.&#xD;
Poor girl! she 's ever so much to be pitied !"&#xD;
" She 's a downright perty-spoken girl !" said Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
" I don' know where I 've seen sich han'some manners, anywheres.&#xD;
You better tell her, mother, 't seem' to.morrer 's Sunday, she might&#xD;
as well make up her mind to stop over with us till Monday,;if not&#xD;

The door was closed, but not latched. Charlotte Woods, as she&#xD;

lay upon the bed, in the darkened room, could hear all that was&#xD;
said ; and a ray of almost heavenly rapture stole, thrilling and&#xD;
soothing, into the troubled depths of her soul. All this time the&#xD;
elements raged without,-the rain lashed the panes, the wind&#xD;
whistled, the lightning winked its fiery eye ever and anon, glaring&#xD;
into the chamber, - and the contrast of the storm with the peace&#xD;
and comfort she had found with her new friends served tointensify&#xD;
all the pure and sweet emotions that arose in her grateful heart.&#xD;
When Mrs. Jackwood returned to her she found her weeping;&#xD;
but her face was illumined, and her eyes glistened with a tender&#xD;
light.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood and the children had, in the mean timle, returned&#xD;
to the table ; and Phoebe amused herself by laughing at Abime-&#xD;
lech's pail of water. At first the boy retorted ; then he became&#xD;
unaccountably silent, pouting over his pie ; and finally, yielding&#xD;
to an irresistible fit of drowsiness, he began to nod assent to all&#xD;
that was said. The unfinished pie-crust had fallen from his hand,&#xD;
and his lips were still distended with the last mouthful, when his&#xD;
deep breathing, growing deeper still, verged upon a snore.&#xD;
" What ye doin', Phoebe ?" demanded Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
"Only tickling his nose a little," laughed Phoebe, mischiev-&#xD;
, 7   ously.&#xD;
At that moment Abimelech sneezed, blowing a full charge of&#xD;
pie-crumbs into his bosom. Partially awakened, he half opened&#xD;
his eyes, but, closing them again immediately, with a deep sigh,&#xD;
he rolled over, comfortably, into his father's lap.&#xD;
"Why could n't ye let the boy alone ?" said Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
tr " You're always up to some nonsense ! "&#xD;
"It does we good to plague him. That sneeze came perty&#xD;
nigh taking his head off! I don't suppose he 'd have woke up if&#xD;
it had."&#xD;
I guess lie 'd better be put to bed."&#xD;
I beg of ye, father," exclaimed Mrs. Jackwood, "don't carry&#xD;
that gre't sleepy-head up-stairs in your arms ! He should be&#xD;
made to walk."&#xD;
" What 's the use o' wakin' him when he 's fast asleep ?" said&#xD;

"I 'll carry the lamp," said Mrs. Jackwood, - "if you will be&#xD;
so foolish ! I've got to go up and fix a bed for that girl."&#xD;
Half an hour later, having drank the tea prepared for her, and&#xD;
eaten a few morsels of food, Charlotte Woods took leave of the&#xD;
parents, who bade her a kind and cheerful "good-night," and&#xD;
retired, with Phoebe, to her chamber.&#xD;
The, young girl was) in a sociable mood, and wished to talk ;&#xD;
but the wanderer was too weary to take part in the conversation.&#xD;
Her head had scarce touched the pillow, before she was asleep.&#xD;
But she started strangely, and moaned, and sometimes cried aloud,&#xD;
in the trouble of her dreams. Phoebe was frightened, and awoke&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Where am I?"&#xD;
The storm was raging again; the wind blew, the rain pattered&#xD;
on the roof, the thunder rolled in the sky.&#xD;
"You are with me, -don't you know ?"&#xD;
" 0, yes ! " said the wanderer, fervently.&#xD;
"IL was scart, and woke you up," rejoined Phoebe. "You&#xD;
was talking in your sleep."&#xD;
" Was I ?-- Did you hear ? " cried the other, quickly. " What&#xD;
did I say ? "&#xD;
At that moment a vivid flash, illumining the chamber, showed&#xD;
her starting up with pallid looks, one arm sunk in the pillow, and&#xD;
the other flung across the covering of the bed.&#xD;
"I could n't make out much," replied Phoebe. "I heard you&#xD;
say, 'Don't ! it will kill me !' and that 's all I can remember."&#xD;
"Are you sure ?- Tell me all I said ! "&#xD;
Phoebe could recall nothing more ; and the stranger guest,&#xD;
recovering from her alarm, sank again upon the pillow, and&#xD;
listened to the rain on the roof until she was once more asleep.&#xD;

THE SABBATH MORNING.&#xD;
IT was day when the wanderer awoke. Through the window.&#xD;
curtain, which looked like a wlite cotton apron tied by its strings&#xD;
across the sash, the light of a new morning. streamed into the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
How calm and cool it seemed ! At first she felt that she could&#xD;
always lie there, in such sweet peace and languor, and gaze upon&#xD;
that light. But the past rushed with great waves upon her heart,&#xD;
and, becoming restless with anxious thoughts, she arose silently&#xD;
from the bed.&#xD;
She resumed the faded calico gown Mrs. Jackwood's kindness&#xD;
had furnished; it was an awkward fit, but it could not altogether&#xD;
conceal the symmetry of her form. Then, standing before a little&#xD;
looking-glass, she combed out her thick, black hair, and, curling it&#xD;
on her fingers, looped it up in luxuriant masses, over her temples.&#xD;
This done, she bathed her face in a tin basin, with water from a&#xD;
broken-nosed pitcher, and, slipping the cotton curtain aside upon&#xD;
its string, sat down by the window.&#xD;
The storm was over ; the clouds had cleared away; it was a&#xD;
beautiful Sabbath morning.~ The low   valley, through which&#xD;
.  wound the stream, lay white-robed in silvery mists ; but all the&#xD;
western range of mountains was flooded with the sunrise.&#xD;
'When Phobe awoke, and saw her companion sitting there with&#xD;
troubled looks, she felt that she ought to console her.&#xD;
"I don't believe you like it here very well; 1 guess you're&#xD;
homesick."&#xD;
0, I do like it  It is so quiet, so peaceful, here!"&#xD;
I think it is a real mean old house," responded Phobe. "If&#xD;

but, as it is, I'm unhappy as I can be ! "&#xD;
"0," said her companion, "if you could only know what it is&#xD;
to be without a home -"&#xD;
" Father tells me I don't know how to appreciate a home. But&#xD;
I can't help it; I can't be contented here."&#xD;
" I suppose, then," said Charlotte, with a tender smile, "you&#xD;
will soon think of changing both your name and abode."&#xD;
" I won't marry a farmer, any way ! " cried Phoebe. "I've&#xD;
always said that, and I'll stick to it, if I live an old maid ! "&#xD;
Her pretty face and bright eyes sparkled with animation; and,&#xD;
arising, the first thing she did was to look in the glass, and read&#xD;
once more the charming tale of her own beauty.&#xD;
"Father says he bets I'll go through the woods and take up&#xD;
with a crooked stick," she continued, with amusing frankness.&#xD;
"I don't care,-I could have my pick of 'most any of the&#xD;
young fellows about here. iB,ut they an't much; they are 'most all&#xD;
farmers' boys ; and I'11 have a merchant or a lawyer, if anybody."&#xD;
"Phoebe," called Mrs. Jackwood- at the -foot of the chamber-&#xD;
stairs,-" an't you 'most ready to come down ?  You need n't&#xD;
stay up there all day, if it is Sunday. Let her lie and sleep, if she&#xD;
wants to; it 'll do her good to rest."'&#xD;
So kind an allusion to herself brought the tenderest tearful&#xD;
light to the wanderer's eyes.&#xD;
" You need n't come down till noon, if you don't want to," said,&#xD;
the lively Phoebe. " You won't care to go to meeting, I sup-&#xD;
pose."&#xD;
" Hardly," said Charlotte, with a sad smile. "Shall you go?"&#xD;
" 0, yes ; I would n't stay away such a day as this, I tell you !&#xD;
I like to see folks when I'm dressed up; it is silly, perhaps, but&#xD;
I can't help it. I don't care for the preaching; we've got a real&#xD;
stupid minister - I don't ought to say so, though, I suppose. Are&#xD;
you pious ?  Do you care for what I say ?"&#xD;
Charlotte knew not how to reply to such queer questions.&#xD;
" Perhaps you belong to the church  " added Phobe, blushing&#xD;
rosy red; " I would n't like to hurt your feelings, though I must&#xD;
Lay I'm glad I don't belong to it ! Mother has urged me and&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SABBATH MORNING.                   85&#xD;
urged me to join; she 's had the minister here to talk to me hours&#xD;
at a stretch. But the truth of it is, I like to carry on too well;&#xD;
and I an't going to settle down and put on a long face, and be&#xD;
pious, yet a while! I thought Il experienced religion, one time;&#xD;
but I guess it did n't amount to much ; there 's more fun in me&#xD;
than ever. Well, I wish I was good,"-more seriously.. "I&#xD;
know I ought to be pious, - but it an't in me."&#xD;
Charlotte's limbs felt weak and sore ; but she thought it would&#xD;
be better for her to make an effort to move, and she descended the&#xD;
stairs with Phoebe. They reached the kitchen just as Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood was going out, with the milk-pails on his arm. He paused&#xD;
to bid her good-morning ; and she thanked him for his kindness&#xD;
with so much tender feeling that his eyes began to glisten.&#xD;
"Wal," said he, winking, "make yourself to home; that'll&#xD;
suit me best of anything.  Come, Bim'lech," turning to his son,&#xD;
"d' ye expect I 'm goin' to do all the milkin' in futur', 'cause I&#xD;
let ye off last night?7"&#xD;
"I'm stiff as I can be," muttered the boy, limping from the&#xD;
corner. "I can't straighten out."&#xD;
"IThis comes o' goin' a-fishin'. Come, I'll limber ye up ! "&#xD;
Charlotte was anxious to render Mrs. Jackwood some assistance&#xD;
in her work. At the same time she confessed her ignorance of&#xD;
kitchen affairs.&#xD;
" Wal, I guess you'd be about as much bother as you're&#xD;
wuth," said Mrs. Jackwood.&#xD;
"I might soon learn to do something, if you would show me."&#xD;
La, sus, I can let ye try, if that 's all ! But you 'd larn&#xD;
more to look on, I should think. There 's so many little chores,&#xD;
V   Sunday morning, I can't tell myself what 's to be done till I come&#xD;
to 't."&#xD;
Charlotte proved unusually intelligent and apt.&#xD;
"There 's some sense in tryin' to larn you somethin'," said&#xD;
y Mrs. Jackwood, encouragingly. " I'm so particular, 't gener'ly&#xD;
4   I can't bear to have any one lift a finger in my kitchen, without&#xD;
it 's Phoebe; and she sometimes tries my patience almost to death !&#xD;
SAs for them gre't awk'rd Irish girls, -the slouchin' critturs ! -I&#xD;
won't so much as have 'em 'round !"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8115-00000019"/>&#xD;
86               THE SABBATH MORNING.&#xD;
Thus encouraged, Charlotte emptied the sour milk Mrs. Jack-&#xD;
wood was skimming ; helped scald the pans ; turned the pork&#xD;
that was frying in the spider ; and assisted Phoebe to set the&#xD;
table.&#xD;
" Wal, you 're about the handiest girl 't ever I see. I can't say&#xD;
less 'n that, any way. I wonder you never did house-work before.&#xD;
You take to 't nat'ral as ducks to the water ! Some folks never&#xD;
can see into 't, somehow; they can't so much as wipe the dishes,&#xD;
say nothin' 'bout washin' 'em, without you stand over 'em every&#xD;
minute o' thie time, an' tell 'em how. You 'ye no idee how nar-&#xD;
vous it makes me feel !"&#xD;
" I'm afraid I should draw pretty severely on your patience,&#xD;
sometimes," said Charlotte.&#xD;
"'T would n't be to be wondered at, if you did. The best miss&#xD;
it, now an' then, ypu know. And I have ri't all the patience I&#xD;
should have, or might have, I 'm sorry to say. You could put&#xD;
up with a little frettin', though, I guess ; it 's my natur' to fret."&#xD;
" Take my word for that:! " laughed Phoebe.&#xD;
" You need 't say that, now !" cried her mother. "I don't think&#xD;
I'm any gre't of a fretter, I 'm sure. I consider I'm perty tol-&#xD;
er'ble patient, now ! You won't find many women that '11 put up&#xD;
with what I have to put up with, depend upon 't. Don't say&#xD;
agin I'm a gre't fretter, if you know what 's good for yourself!"&#xD;
Presently, Mr. Jackwood and Abimelech coming in, the family&#xD;
sat down to breakfast.&#xD;
" You don't live by eatin', I see," the farmer said to his guest.&#xD;
" You never 'll do for a farmer's darter, till you can eat pork and&#xD;
johnny-cake."&#xD;
After breakfast Mr. Jackwood took down the big family Bible&#xD;
from the mantel-piece, and, having adjusted a pair of blackened&#xD;
steel-bowed spectacles, opened it on his knee. At the same time&#xD;
Phoebe and Abimelech brought out their Testaments from the bed-&#xD;
room, and, after a little dispute about "the place," obeyed their&#xD;
father, who enjoined silence. Mrs. Jackwood took her seat by the&#xD;
open door, where she could keep an eye on the poultry before the&#xD;
stoop, and flirt her apron at them occasionally, as they attempted&#xD;
to invade the kitchen.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SABBATH MORNING.&#xD;
&#xD;
Scarce had the farmer begun to read, when a gallant young&#xD;
turkey, taking advantage of Mrs. Jackwood's contemplative mood,&#xD;
charged past her apron, and made a bold dash at the crumbs&#xD;
under the table.&#xD;
"Bim'lech ! do help me git this critter out!  We must have a&#xD;
whip, and keep it for these nasty turkeys! "&#xD;
Bim, with warlike resolution: " Clear the track !"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood : "Don't be ha'sh, my son ! Don't throw yer&#xD;
book !"&#xD;
She spoke too late. The boy's Testament whizzed by the cor-&#xD;
ner of the table, and, glancing on the back of Phoebe's chair, flut-&#xD;
tered down into a dish of grease on the stove-hearth.&#xD;
"Now you've done it ! " cried Phoebe.&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood, quivering: " I've as good a mind to box your&#xD;
ears as ever I had t' eat ! "&#xD;
"'T an't hurt much," said Abimelech, grinning, as he held the&#xD;
Testament up by the leaves, to let the grease drip off.&#xD;
"Every Sunday mornin'," began Mrs. Jackwood, regularr as&#xD;
the day comes 'round, that 'ere grease-dish has' to come out o' the&#xD;
suller-way, an' set smutcherin' on the stove, till the shoes are all&#xD;
blacked for meetin'! For my part, I 'm heartily sick on 't; an' if&#xD;
I could had my way, this never 'd a' happened."&#xD;
"Come, come ! don't be unreason'ble mother," said Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood. "Accidents will happen."'&#xD;
"Unreasonable ?  If you 'd make a bizness on 't, you could set&#xD;
down and warm the dish, an' grease yer shoes, an' done with't, all&#xD;
in five minutes' time. An' here that thing 's ben 'round a hull&#xD;
S    hour, if 't has a minute ! Then Bim'lech had to fling his book !&#xD;
An' now he 's lettin' the grease drop all over the floor ! I never&#xD;
see the beat ! There! "&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood gave vent to her feelings in a sharp cuff be-&#xD;
stowed on Abimelech's ear.&#xD;
Bim, howling: " Ow-- w--w.-  w! Qpit!"&#xD;
"Quit, quit !" echoed the turkey, darting behind the stove.&#xD;
"'Don't tell me to quit!" exclaimed Mrs. Jackwood, address-&#xD;
ing Bim more particularly, "you sauce-box!"&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
37&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8115-00000020"/>&#xD;
88               THE SABBATH MORNING.&#xD;
In terror of another blow, Bim dropped the book and dodged&#xD;
behind Charlotte's chair.&#xD;
" Come, let's have peace, this holy Sabbath mornin'!" said Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood. "Bim'lech, take yer seat, and look over with Phoebe!"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood, endeavoring to control her feelings, but still&#xD;
quivering with excitement, stooped to pick up the book.&#xD;
" Giease an' all on this clean floor, mopped only yist'day!&#xD;
It 's no more use noppin' an' scourin' in this house than -Gi' me&#xD;
a knife, Phoebe!"&#xD;
" I-gracious!" cried Bim, with a wild look, throwing up his&#xD;
hands in a protective attitude about his ears.&#xD;
" We 're waitin' mother," observed Mr. Jackwood, quietly.&#xD;
"You '11 have to wait till I scrape up a little of this grease,&#xD;
'fore it 's trod all over the house. - Where 's that turkey ?"&#xD;
"He 's out o' the house," snarled Bim, " an'. I wish I was !"&#xD;
"Don't talk so,'' said Mr. Jackwood. "Remember, there 's a&#xD;
stranger present. Now, if you're all ready, we '11 read."&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood resumed her station in the door-way, and, set-&#xD;
ting the broom as a trap to be sprung upon the poultry, composed&#xD;
herself to listen.&#xD;
"Commence, Bim'lech," said the farmer.&#xD;
Bim'lech, sullenly: "llan't got no book ! "&#xD;
"I told ye to look over-with Phoebe. Third varse."&#xD;
Bim mumbled over his task, as if merit consisted in the most&#xD;
rapid and indistinct utterance that could be called reading..&#xD;
"Bim'lech, read that 'ere last varse over ag'in, an' try to take&#xD;
the sense on 't.&#xD;
" Phoebe won't le' me look on! 'She holds the book 'way off ! "&#xD;
"4Anybody 'd think you wanted to eat the book up !"-and&#xD;
Phoebe mischievously thrust her Testament under the boy's nose.&#xD;
"Now can ye see?"&#xD;
"tCome ! -stop ! I swanny, I won't read another word !"&#xD;
"Take holt o' that book, my son, an' don't le 's have any more&#xD;
o' yer nonsense. This is perty work for Sunday mornin'! "&#xD;
Phobe giggling; Abimelech pouting; Mr. Jackwood looking&#xD;
sternly over his glasses at the offenders; Charlotte trying to be&#xD;
serious, but laughing, with her sunny eyes, in spite of herself.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SABBATH MORNING.                  89&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood: "Shoo ! shoo !"-flirting her apron at the&#xD;
turkeys. " Git away with ye !"&#xD;
At length, peace restored, the reading was concluded,- an&#xD;
entire chapter of the Acts having been dispensed for the edifica-&#xD;
tion of the household circle. Half a chapter was the usual allow-&#xD;
ance; but a double portion was adjudged appropriate for Sunday,&#xD;
which seemed to afford more time for such devotions than week-&#xD;
days are supposed to do.&#xD;
Having made a few remarks on the text, Mr. Jackwood, kneel.&#xD;
ing over the Bible in his chair, prayed with a certain earnestness,&#xD;
which bore up Charlotte's soul on wings of devotion. But the&#xD;
children's hearts were untouched; it was a threadbare prayer to&#xD;
them: although kneeling reverently, they occupied themselves in&#xD;
whispering, pinching,.and making faces at each other, all in a&#xD;
quiet way, until it was concluded. Mrs. Jackwood was suffi-&#xD;
ciently serious for the occasion; yet she could not keep her eyes&#xD;
off the turkeys, nor refrain from shaking her skirts at them when&#xD;
they approached the door.&#xD;
The morning devotions ended, Mr. Jackwood got out. his shav-&#xD;
ing apparatus; raised a lather which made his face look like a&#xD;
mighty ice-cream; honed his razor; and, perching the kitchen&#xD;
looking-glass on the window-frame, stood before it, with his feet&#xD;
well braced for the operation, and proceeded to take off his&#xD;
" baird."  Mrs. Jackwood washed /the dishes, and  Charlotte&#xD;
wiped them, while Phoebe and Abimelech quarrelled over their&#xD;
Sunday-school lesson, which they were pretending to study together&#xD;
n the bed-room.&#xD;
Employment diverted Charlotte's mind ; but when there was&#xD;
nothing more for her to do, she became despondent. In vain she&#xD;
endeavored to repay the kindness of her friends with cheerful&#xD;
looks and words. The tears would start, the sighs would swill up&#xD;
from the deep well of trouble in her breast.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood felt that he ought to-say something to comfort&#xD;
her. "You an't growin' impatient, an' thinkin' o' leavin' on us,&#xD;
'   be ye?" he cried, coming out of the bed-room, with his Sunday-&#xD;
shirt on. " Of course you would n't wish to be travelin' on the&#xD;
Sabbath?-Here, mother," turning to look for his wife, -"you '11&#xD;
have to button my rizbuns, arter all. Where be ye ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8115-00000021"/>&#xD;
40               THE SABBATH MORNING.&#xD;
" Let me button them, if you please," said Charlotte.&#xD;
" Them don't look like farmers' wives' hands," observed Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood, submitting the wristbands; " they 're nimble enough,&#xD;
though ; I guess they might be made useful, don't you?"&#xD;
"I should be glad to make them so, indeed !"&#xD;
"Would ye, though? There 's chances enough for that, I&#xD;
should think. You 'd want some lady-like occupation, though, I&#xD;
s'pose."&#xD;
" I would not care much what it was," said the girl, "if I&#xD;
could see, now and then, a kind face!"&#xD;
"Wal, wal ! "- cheeringly, -" suthin' '11 turn up, if you put&#xD;
your trust in Providence, -that 's. sartin.  At all events, we '11&#xD;
agree to keep ye till there does."&#xD;
"Now, father !" remonstrated Mrs. Jackwood, entering at that&#xD;
moment, "don't. make no rash promises, I beseech !"&#xD;
"0," said their guest, quickly, "I could not accept your kind-&#xD;
ness, if I would ! I ought," - a heavy shadeof trouble darkened&#xD;
her face, - " I know I ought to go - perhaps to-day ! "&#xD;
" Tut, tat ! that 's nonsense !" returned these hospitable farmer.&#xD;
" We can keep ye for a few days, jes' 's well 's not."&#xD;
"Why do you, father ?" said Mrs. Jackwood, aside. "I 've&#xD;
nothin' agin thogirl; an' I mus' confess she 's about the handiest&#xD;
person, for one t han't ben thoroughly drilled in housework, 't ever&#xD;
I see. But we don' know nothin' who she is, nor where she come&#xD;
from, nor nothin' 't all about her; so it stan's us in hand to be&#xD;
careful.",&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood was struck with the force of the observation.&#xD;
But, turning to Charlotte, and looking into those deep, earnest&#xD;
eyes, his wife's-argument melted before them like frost in the sun&#xD;
"Wal, we '11 talk it over to-norrow. But, take my word&#xD;
for't," -with a cheering glance at his guest, -"'t '11 all turn&#xD;
out right in'the end."&#xD;
In a little while Mr. Jackwood and the children went off to&#xD;
meeting in the one-horse wagon, driving the old white mare - an&#xD;
establishment of which Phobe, to use her own expression, was&#xD;
" ashamed as she could be." Charlotte watched until they were&#xD;
out of sight, and still sat gazing anxiously from the window, while&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood finished the Sunday morning " chores."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE 'SABBATH MORNING.                  41&#xD;
"I 'm tired," at length said the farmer's wife, "an' I 'm going'&#xD;
to lop down a few minutes on the bed. You can come in an' set&#xD;
by me, if ye like."&#xD;
The truth is, Mrs. Jackwood wished to keep an eye on Char-&#xD;
lotte. "Appearances are desaitful," she reasoned, "an' there 's&#xD;
no knowin' what may happen!"     With this view, she took a&#xD;
newspaper, to keep herself awake when conversation failed.&#xD;
"I declare!" she exclaimed, suddenly, as she read, "what a&#xD;
strange thing that was happened the other day! Have you heard&#xD;
about it?"&#xD;
She read a few paragraphs, while the other listened breath-&#xD;
lessly.&#xD;
"There's more about it, in fine print; but that 'pears to be the&#xD;
substance. Had n't you heard nothin' of it ?"&#xD;
" I-I believe I heard some men talking about it, yesterday,"&#xD;
faltered Charlotte; "but I did n't know ivhere it happened. How&#xD;
far is the place from here ?"&#xD;
I don't know ; it 's out in York State somewheres."&#xD;
Charlotte breathed again, passing her hand across he'r pallid&#xD;
face. At the same time Mrs. Jackwood, although fully deter-&#xD;
mined not to fall asleep, closed her eyes, letting the newspaper&#xD;
sink gradually upon the bed. Having favored the fst advances&#xD;
of an insidious temptation, and turned her face towards the sweet&#xD;
garden of sleep, she ended, as mortals are prone to do, by yield-&#xD;
ing a second step, and then a third, until, with the very best resolu-&#xD;
tions in the world, she passed the gate of slumber, and sank down&#xD;
upon a deep poppy-bed, where a troop of mischievous sprites,&#xD;
called dreams, seized her, and transported her into the inmost&#xD;
recesses of the enchanted garden.&#xD;
Then Charlotte, with stealthy hand, took up the paper and&#xD;
glanced hurriedly over the columns. Finding the place where&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood had been reading, she went over, with burning&#xD;
interest, the portions that had been omitted; then layin down&#xD;
the paper, without awakening the good woman, she glided&#xD;
noiselessly from the room,&#xD;

V.&#xD;
HECTOR.&#xD;
THE evening was soft and warm. The sky spread calm and&#xD;
starry above the sultry city. The houses were thrown open to&#xD;
catch the breath of a light south wind that blew gently up the&#xD;
bay. Many of the inhabitants were in the* streets, sitting before&#xD;
their doors, or strolling up and down ; while upon the river the&#xD;
negro bargemen sang their wild and plaintive melodies, in the&#xD;
moonlight that shone over the water.&#xD;
At ten o'clock, two young men landed from a pleasure-boat,&#xD;
and walked arm-in-arm into the town.&#xD;
" Here we are again," said one, pointing with his cane. "It is&#xD;
on this corner we met. ' Well, we have had a pleasant sail, and I&#xD;
have you to thank for it.",&#xD;
a I stifle," returned the other, " in these close streets.- When I&#xD;
look up at the stars, I would fly!  How cool, how far-off, how&#xD;
pure, they are ! "&#xD;
" You are homesick, Hector."&#xD;
" No, Joseph, -but a little heart-sick ! Life seems so rotten&#xD;
here, my hands feel slimy with it, and I reach up instinctively,&#xD;
as if to wash them in the light of the stars. What is the great&#xD;
end of existence, Joseph?"&#xD;
"Upon my word," cried Joseph, "I don't know.!"&#xD;
" You have lived too long in this contagious atmosphere of&#xD;
vice!" rejoined Hector. " There is danger here of forgetting&#xD;
what the word existence means. Do you not often start, and cry&#xD;
out, ' Is this humanity? am I a part of it ? who are we? what&#xD;
are we ?. why do we exist?'"&#xD;
" When I dwell upon such things," answered Joseph, " I have-&#xD;
the blue devils horridly ! "&#xD;
&#xD;
IECT9R.                       48&#xD;
" The thought haunts me continually. It tyrannizes over me&#xD;
like conscience.  Night and day, wherever I go, whatever I&#xD;
see or do, the inexorable voice whispers, 'To what end is it&#xD;
all ?'"&#xD;
"Will you tell me what you live for?"&#xD;
" I live for LOVE ! " exclaimed Hector.&#xD;
"You!" laughed his companion. "Do you know that, with&#xD;
all the ladies of my acquaintance, you have the reputation of&#xD;
being the coldest and most indifferent mortal in the world ?"&#xD;
" With the ladies of your acquaintance ! " repeated the other,&#xD;
significantly. " I like the compliment ! But, let me tell you,&#xD;
there is an ocean of love palpitating and throbbing in tiat heart&#xD;
they find so cold. It waits for a possessor."&#xD;
" Which you will never find !"&#xD;
" In truth, I do not expect it. I take leave of southern society'&#xD;
in a few days ; I go home to my native Vermont, to spend a soli-&#xD;
tary summer among the mountains. There is nothing for me there&#xD;
but thought and study. And as for Mobile, I have had strange&#xD;
experiences here ; I have learned something of woman's heart, in&#xD;
spite of my coldness ; but it, is all in the past, thank heaven! and&#xD;
nothing will ever allure me here again."&#xD;
"You are right ! " said Joseph, thoughtfully. "I wish I was&#xD;
going with you.  Rob Greenwich is up that way somewhere, is&#xD;
he not?"&#xD;
" Where Rob Greenwich is, it 's not easy to say.  He goes&#xD;
where passion leads him, -not like you and me, dear Joseph!"&#xD;
said Hector, ironically. "But, if you ask where his home is, I&#xD;
can tell you. It's in the village of Huntersford, about a mile&#xD;
and a half from my father's house. I will show it you when you&#xD;
come to visit me this summer."&#xD;
"I ? - That's out of the question, unless I marry a rich wife,&#xD;
and go north for a wedding tour."&#xD;
"Well, do that, and you shall have a double welcome."&#xD;
"If I had your opportunities," said Joseph, " perhaps I might.&#xD;
Ty friendship will never forgive you for not marrying Helen.&#xD;
Sis rich, beautiful, and charming ; more than all, she loves&#xD;
you-.-"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8115-00000023"/>&#xD;
44                       HECTOR.&#xD;
"A woman," cried Hector, "who holds human property; who&#xD;
must have her slaves to wait upon her ; who would not give them'&#xD;
up even for me! Judge how well she loves me ! But we will&#xD;
not discuss that question. Take her, if you can get her, black&#xD;
servants and all. And now good-night. You have an engage-&#xD;
ment, and are anxious to get rid of me."&#xD;
" True," said Joseph, "I have a call to make ; but -"&#xD;
" No compliments. We part here.  Joseph, be worthy of the&#xD;
name!"&#xD;
Leaving his friend to proceed alone, Hector turned a corner,&#xD;
and walked, with folded arms, along a street brilliant with lighted&#xD;
saloons.* The doors of these places were thrown open, pouring&#xD;
floods of yellow light upon the street, and exposing all the allure-&#xD;
ments of dissipation within, from the well-furnished bar to the gay&#xD;
and voluptuous pictures that adorned the walls.&#xD;
Into one of these, led by the same habit of observing human&#xD;
nature which had prompted his visit to the south, Hector Dun-&#xD;
bury strolled abstractedly. It was a celebrated saloon, called the&#xD;
" Revolver," either in honor of the weapon so named, or in conse-&#xD;
quence of a certain rotary notion with which- the brains of its&#xD;
patrons were apt to become familiar. The sign above the door&#xD;
favored both these ideas;-showing on one side the device of a&#xD;
huge six-shooting pistol, and on the other that of a jolly gentle-&#xD;
man reeling under the weight of one glass of liquor in his hand,&#xD;
and several more in his head.&#xD;
Within, conversation,-music, and -dancing, together with the fine&#xD;
arts, or rather the coarse arts, added their charms to the attrac-&#xD;
tion of the bar. The music was by an itinerant performer, who&#xD;
exercised a feeble violin, with an accompaniment of bells which&#xD;
he jingled with one foot, a triangle which he sounded from time&#xD;
to time with the other, and a pair of cymbals played between his&#xD;
knees. ~The dancing was by two artists, a male and a female.-&#xD;
The one, a cotton-dealer, of "respectable " standing in southern&#xD;
society, carried away by the enthusiasm of over-strong potations,&#xD;
had volunteered a double pigeonwing, in a style that would have&#xD;
somewhat astonished his mercantile connections in New York and&#xD;
Boston. The female was no other than a learned duck, had in&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR.                        45&#xD;
charge by a ragged urchin, the fiddler's companion, who excited&#xD;
her to a noble 'emulation of .the cotton-dealer's extraordinary&#xD;
performance.&#xD;
At the bar, Hector called for a glass of lemonade,&#xD;
" No fire in it for me !" he exclaimed, as the bar-tender was&#xD;
about to dash some brandy into the tumbler.&#xD;
" Lemonade ?" echoed a dark, bearded individual, on his,&#xD;
left, inclining over the bar.  " The same for me - with a&#xD;
good deal of the extra. In short, make it a punch. And you,&#xD;
Dickson?"&#xD;
"Yes, doctor, if you please," said a third customer, thickly.&#xD;
"If I please?" cried the doctor. "What 's the matter ?"&#xD;
"Nothing," replied Dickson, "only I 'm conside'bly 'fected by&#xD;
the music."&#xD;
"Do ye call that music ?" cried his companion. ." I '11 make&#xD;
better with a saw-file and a pair of tongs ! "&#xD;
"Recollect," said the bar-tender, "that, six weeks ago, that man&#xD;
had never seen a fiddle."&#xD;
"aHe plays well, for six weeks ! " observed Dickson, with drunk-&#xD;
en gravity.&#xD;
" You swallow such a story as that in your liquor!" retorted&#xD;
the doctor. "I 'm ashamed of you!"&#xD;
And he playfully thrust his friend's hat over his features, like&#xD;
an extinguisher.&#xD;
"I said," gasped Dickson, struggling out of his hat, and&#xD;
looking up with a ludicrous expression' of bewilderment, "I&#xD;
said  where is what I said ?   I dropped it as a candid re-&#xD;
iark," ---and he looked about him as if expecting to find it&#xD;
on the counter, or on the floor.  "Who knocked my hat over&#xD;
my eyes?"&#xD;
"'T was the lemonade gentleman, I reckon," replied the doctor.&#xD;
" He appears anxious to apologize. As for your marvellous fid-&#xD;
dler,"  and he turned his back, while Dickson staggered fiercely&#xD;
upon Hector.&#xD;

never seen a fiddle six weeks ago. Perhaps you 'd like -to take&#xD;
a bet."&#xD;

46                      RECTOR.&#xD;
"Well, I reckon !" cried the doctor. "I '11 go the drinks for&#xD;
the company."&#xD;
" All right ! " returned the other. "The man is blind ! "&#xD;
" Sold, by Jove ! " shouted the doctor, flinging. his hat across&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
At that moment a thickly-articulated cry for help was heard ;&#xD;
the doctor recognized his own name, and the voice of a friend. It&#xD;
was Dickson, whose drunken attackupon Hector had proved some-.&#xD;
thing of a failure, and who now, in consequence, lay in a disagree-&#xD;
able heap under the table, where he was trying to open the wall,&#xD;
mistaking it for the door.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Hector had taken his seat in the corner, with his&#xD;
lemonade before him.  Declining the doctor's invitation to the&#xD;
bar, he sat looking on, with a listless expression, while the rest&#xD;
of the company celebrated the bet.  The blind man was led up&#xD;
by the ragged urchin, who grinned over his gin-and-sugar with&#xD;
the men at the bar, and smacked his lips afterwards, as if he&#xD;
loved it.&#xD;
The company then, becoming hilarious, formed a ring to observe'&#xD;
the duck dance. Among other amusing feats the wonderful biped&#xD;
performed, was that of recognizing the medical faculty, and salut-&#xD;
ing them in the crowd. Her sagacity in that respect was fairly&#xD;
tested, the betting doctor being the subject.  Stopping before&#xD;
him, in her waddling rounds, she uttered the characteristic&#xD;
cry,&#xD;
" Quack ! quack ! "&#xD;
A shout of exultation from the spectators. The doctor, excited,&#xD;
offered to wager that the experiment would not succeed a second&#xD;
time. The bet taken, he changed his position ; and once more-&#xD;
the duck, waddling about the floor to the blind fiddler's music,&#xD;
stopped suddenly, and, bobbing her head up and down, politely&#xD;
saluted the doctor.&#xD;
"Quack! quack ! quack ! "&#xD;
The applause was tremendous.   Some drunken fellows fell&#xD;
down upon the floor, and rolled and roared. '@e doctor's eyes&#xD;
flashed.&#xD;
" Who says that 's true ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR.                      4'&#xD;
Dickson, who had by this time crept from under the table, mut-&#xD;
tering revenge, indicated Hector with his tipsy fist. The doctoi&#xD;
marched up to the young man, in a blustering way, and demanded&#xD;
an apology.&#xD;
Hector sipped his lemonade coolly, but made no reply.&#xD;
"Do you know who I am?" hissed the doctor.&#xD;
"No," replied Hector, "unless I am to take the duck's word."&#xD;
"You are a liar ! " articulated the, doctor, with choking&#xD;
passion.&#xD;
The next instant, the contents of Hector's glass were streaming&#xD;
from his brows, and eyes, and beard ; and Hector stood upon his&#xD;
feet, pale, but firm, grasping the empty tumbler in his hand.&#xD;
As the doctor staggered back from the shock, his hand instinct-&#xD;
ively found its way to his bosom, where it came in contact with&#xD;
the handle of a pistol. He drew it, and levelled it at Hector.&#xD;
But quick as thought it flew to the ceiling, struck up by a swift&#xD;
blow from his adversary's hand.&#xD;
At this juncture, the courageous Dickson made a sally in favor&#xD;
of his ally, with a chair upon his head. Hector leaped aside, and&#xD;
the blow intended for him fell upon the crown of the dancing&#xD;
cotton-dealer. At the same time, the doctor rushed forward with&#xD;
a brandished knife.&#xD;
"Take care-! " cried Hector, stepping back.&#xD;
There was something in his tone and look which betokened a&#xD;
roused and dangerous spirit. The doctor might have been warned;&#xD;
but his passion blinded him, and, with an oath, shQwing his firm-&#xD;
set, glittering teeth, under his curled moustache, he aimed a blow&#xD;
at the young man's breast.  On the instant, the empty glass,&#xD;
which was Hector's only weapon, was shivered in the face of his&#xD;
antagonist ; who, stunned and gashed, dropped upon one knee,&#xD;
letting fall his weapon, and supporting himself with his hand upon&#xD;
the floor.&#xD;
Hector was unhurt ; and, the moment he saw his adversary&#xD;
down, he sprang to raise him up, and helped him to a chair.&#xD;
" Dickson !" cried out the doctor, in accents of pain and rage,&#xD;
endeavoring to wipe the blood from his eyes ; " by .-----! Dick-&#xD;
~ son !"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8115-00000025"/>&#xD;
48                       HECTOR.&#xD;
A violent tumult had arisen in the saloon. Dickson was in the&#xD;
midst of it, and unable to render his friend any assistance.&#xD;
" 0, -- furies !" articulated the doctor. "Lives shall pay&#xD;
for this !"&#xD;
" We will talk of that," said Hector. " But first let me look&#xD;
to your wound. I sought no quarrel; but it is my way to defend&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
The doctor was not dangerously hurt. His brow was cut, and&#xD;
the blinding blood that streamed down into his eyes rendered him-&#xD;
incapable of offering any opposition. Hector removed the frag-&#xD;
ments-of glass from the wound, and tied. his own handkerchief&#xD;
about it, to staunch the blood.&#xD;
By this time, the police having been alarmed, five or six drunken&#xD;
officials, with badges upon their hats and bricks in them, reeled&#xD;
into the saloon, swaggering and swearing.&#xD;
The ragged urchin, the duck, and the blind fiddler, were the&#xD;
first offenders seized. This was natural, they being not only&#xD;
quite innocent, but incapable of resistance. The police next laid&#xD;
hands upon the cotton-dealer, who, discomfited, sat in Turkish&#xD;
fashion upon his supple legs, in a corner, looking hazily about&#xD;
him, as if vainly endeavoring to comprehend what was going on.&#xD;
After him, the pugnacious Dickson, laid away once more under&#xD;
his favorite table, and fighting heavily with his enemies, dis-&#xD;
guised as table-legs, was dragged out by the heels, and placed&#xD;
under arrest.&#xD;
The police, however, took good care to avoid meddling with&#xD;
such persons as swore terribly and flourished weapons. With&#xD;
them discretion was not only the better part of valor, but the&#xD;
whole of justice. - Hector, therefore, who exercised neither pistols&#xD;
nor profanity, bid fair to become the next victim. He stood,&#xD;
with calm dignity, confronting the officers, when a demonstra-&#xD;
tion on the part of the doctor caused a diversion in another.&#xD;
direction.&#xD;
The latter had been some moments on his feet, looking about,&#xD;
him savagely from beneath his bandaged brows, for his bowie-&#xD;
knife, which Hector had kicked under the chair ; and, now per-&#xD;
ceiving it, he clutched it fiercely, and rushed upon his late antag-&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR.                       49&#xD;
onist. Hector's back was towards him-, and the armed hand was&#xD;
already raised to smite him, when a policeman, seizing the oppor-&#xD;
tunity, stepped behind the assailant, and felled him to the floor.&#xD;
Hector was untouched; and while the officers rushed upon the&#xD;
doctor to secure his weapons and bind his hands, the young man,&#xD;
taking quite an unceremonious leave of the company, walked&#xD;
quietly and quickly out at the door.&#xD;
" 0, corruption !  0, death !" he exclaimed, in accents of&#xD;
loathing, as he fled from the spot. -He shook the dust from his&#xD;
feet; and, perceiving a fountain running in the street, stooped&#xD;
instinctively to wash his hands.  When he would have wiped&#xD;
them, he remembered that he had bound his handkerchief upon&#xD;
his adversary's head.&#xD;
" It is well ! " said he.  " I have left my garment, with&#xD;
them !"&#xD;
The tumult in the saloon partially subsiding, the bar-tender&#xD;
managed, by shouting, to make himself heard.   The officers&#xD;
showed a liberal disposition to listen to the man, whose liquor&#xD;
they drank much oftener than they paid for it ; and on his rep-&#xD;
resentations, the cotton-dealer - a valuable customer - was set&#xD;
at liberty before he had become fully conscious of his arrest.&#xD;
Dickson 'and the other prisoners were released at the same&#xD;
time ; excepting the doctor alone, reserved as a sacrifice to&#xD;
public justice.&#xD;
"iDo what ye please with me," muttered the latter, as one of&#xD;
the officers put on his hat for him over his bandaged brows.&#xD;
" I'ye only one suggestion to make. Le 's liquor !"&#xD;
The police sympathizing with this generous sentiment, their&#xD;
feelings were so much softened, that they at once proceeded to&#xD;
undo his hands, to afford him the gratification of paying for the&#xD;
treat out of his own pocket. This done, he swallowed a potent&#xD;
comforter for his griefs, in the form of a glass of fiery spirits,&#xD;
and set out to accompany an officer to the watch-house.&#xD;
Stopping occasionally to refresh themselves by the way, always&#xD;
at the doctor's expense, officer and prisoner alike forgot their&#xD;
relative positions and their original destination.- The doctor&#xD;

talked desperately of revenge; and so far enlisted the sympa-&#xD;
thies of his guide, that the latter not only promised to assist&#xD;
him in ascertaining Hector's name and' address, but, arrived at&#xD;
a street-corner, he restored his weapons, and shook hands with&#xD;
him, swearing an eternal friendship, and bidding him an affecting&#xD;
good-night.&#xD;
Then, while the faithful guardian of the town moved of unstead-&#xD;
ily, bent on still further exploits in behalf of the public peace, the&#xD;
doctor, examining his pistol and muttering by the way, sought&#xD;
the calm precincts of domestic peace, where his affectionate wife&#xD;
awaited his return.&#xD;
&#xD;
VI.&#xD;
GRANDMOTHER RIGGLESTY.&#xD;
A RHEUMATIo old lady, in a brown bonnet and a faded bomba-&#xD;
zine dress, with a fussy shawl about her neck, arrived at the&#xD;
Excelsior House in the afternoon stage. Alighting with difficulty,&#xD;
with her arms fall of bundles, she gathered herself up on the step,&#xD;
sneezed twice, and scrutinized the crowd of loungers with . an&#xD;
inquisitive scowl.&#xD;
"Is anybody here knows Bim'lech Jackwood ?" she inquired,&#xD;
wrapping the fussy shawl more closely about her neck. " An' has&#xD;
anybody seen him, this arternoon ?"&#xD;
Everybody appeared to know Mr. Abimelech Jackwood, but&#xD;
nobody appeared yto have seen him that afternoon.&#xD;
*      " It 's the trangest thing! Here I wrote to Bim'lech's folks&#xD;
more 'u a week ago ---  There, Mister -you driver ! I knowed&#xD;
that ban'box would git jammed, an' I telled ye so. It's so&#xD;
strange, folks can't be a little mite keerful ! Don't tear. that&#xD;
trunk all to, pieces now, gitt'n on 't down ! I wish you'd hand&#xD;
me that pa'cel I dropped 'fore it gits trod on.-- That 's the wust&#xD;
stage ! I shan't git over it in my j'ints - I do'no' when !"&#xD;
" Supper, ma'am?"&#xD;
"No, I guess not; I 've got sone lunch in my bag. I s'pose,"&#xD;
- the old lady smiled persuasively, --" if Bim'lech's folks don't&#xD;
come perty soon, you can jest gi' me a cup o' tea in my hand, dan't&#xD;
ye, without much charge ? I don't keer for milk an' sugar."&#xD;
She sat down 9n her baggage, while, at her request, the land-&#xD;
lord sent across the way, and ascertained that a letter, post-&#xD;
marked SawneylHook, and addressed to Abimelech Jackwood, had&#xD;
lain in the post-oflice several days.&#xD;

52              GRANDMOTHER RIGGLESTY.&#xD;
" And it 's there yit ! " exclaimed the old lady. "Did ever&#xD;
anything in this world happen jest like that ! Send aletter to say&#xD;
you 're comin'-pay the postage on 't, too -I'm provoked ! You&#xD;
don' know nobody 't 's going' right by Bim'lech's, do ye, 't I can&#xD;
ride with 's well 's not.?  I don't re'ly feel 's tho' 't I could&#xD;
afford to hire a wagon a-puppus."&#xD;
It chanced that one of Mr. Jackwood's neighbors was about&#xD;
starting for home, and could carry her directly to his house.&#xD;
But, on being introduced, the neighbor said, evasively, that he had&#xD;
come to the village on a " buck-board," and could not, conveni-&#xD;
ently, carry so much baggage.&#xD;
" I'll leave the bulk on 't for Bim'lech, then, an' take jest these&#xD;
'ere bundles in my lap. I wonder who it was invented buck-&#xD;
boards,'-spring-boards, they call 'em to Sawney Hook. I never&#xD;
could like 'em. Jest a long teeterin' board, from the fore ex to&#xD;
the hind ex, with nothin' but a seat in the middle, - not a bit of&#xD;
a box, nor no nothin' but the fills an' wheels-! "&#xD;
Unsocial neighbor: "You 're not obliged to ride on one."&#xD;
" 0, II don't find no fault, no way! I look upon 't as a lucky&#xD;
chance !"-in a conciliatory tone. "Bim'lech Jackwood is a&#xD;
son-in-mw of mine. His wife,'Betsy Rigglesty that was, is my&#xD;
darter. Don't ye think I can take this ban'box along, an' hold it&#xD;
'tween our feet ? I 'm 'most afraid to leave it. -0, wait a minute,&#xD;
sir ! my umbrel'! I shall want it to keep the wind off 'm my neck,&#xD;
ridin'. Landlord," whispering mysteriously, " see here a minute !&#xD;
Is that 'ere a drinkin' man? He's very red-faced, an' I am sartin&#xD;
I smelt his breath."&#xD;
"He's an Englishman," said the landlord, "but a perfect&#xD;
gentleman, you'll find him."&#xD;
"It can't be Mr. Dunbury, can it ?  Laws sakes ! I shouldn't&#xD;
'a knowed him, - tho', to tell the truth, I never see him more 'n&#xD;
two' times 't I know on. I wish you'd jest tuck my shawl up&#xD;
around my bunnit a little, so the wind shan't strike to my back.&#xD;
Now, if you 'II hand me this 'ere bag arter I git into that hateful&#xD;
spring-board -"&#xD;
A minute later, with her bundles in her lap, and her faded blue&#xD;
cotton umbrella, of huge dimensions, spread over her left shoulder,&#xD;
&#xD;
GRANDMOTHR RIGGLESTY.                  58&#xD;
the old lady might have been seen riding along the village road&#xD;
with the unsocial neighbor.&#xD;
" This is Mr. Dunbury, I believe?"- talking loud, to make&#xD;
herself heard under the umbrella.&#xD;
The unsocial neighbor heartily wished, just then, that it wasn't&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury. Although a man of fallen fortunes, much of the&#xD;
naughty Englishman's pride -now grown sensitive and sore-&#xD;
adhered to him in his depressed condition; and he experienced a&#xD;
sort of inward fury at the thought that he, a Dunbury, should&#xD;
ever be placed in so ridiculous a position. He acknowledged his&#xD;
identity, however, in a forbidding growl.&#xD;
"Mebby ye don't remember me ? " shouted the old lady under&#xD;
her fortification. "I ben up here to visit my relations three&#xD;
times in my life; an' I recollect the Dunburys. How 's Mis'&#xD;
Dunbury ? Does she have the spine now ? or was it Mis' Wing&#xD;
had a spine in her back ?  I 'most forgit. There ! I declare&#xD;
for 't!"&#xD;
The old lady, struggling to arrange her umbrella, so as to defend&#xD;
herself at all points from the fresh air, sadly to the annoyance&#xD;
of the irritable Englishman, whose face and eyes were endangered,&#xD;
had brought affairs to a pleasant crisis, by quietly knocking off his&#xD;
hat.&#xD;
" Le' me git off 'n git it," she proposed. "Shan't I? If&#xD;
you'll jest hold my umbrel' an' bundles -"&#xD;
" Sit still !" muttered her companion, jumping to the ground.&#xD;
There were plenty of spectators to witness his discomfiture; and,&#xD;
to make matters as bad as possible, the old lady raised her voice&#xD;
to a shrill pitch, as he went back to recover his property.&#xD;
"You see, if 't had been anything but a spring-board, -if&#xD;
there 'd been any sort or kind of a box to the wagon,-your hat&#xD;
would 'a fell into it, an' you would n't had to git out."&#xD;
The neighbor made no reply, but, taking his property out of the&#xD;
dirt, with flushed dignity, put it upon his head, stalked back to the&#xD;
vehicle, and drove on in silent rage. As he did not speak again,&#xD;
until, arrived at Mr. Jackwood's house, he made haste to set her&#xD;
down at the gate, she considered herself shamefully treated.&#xD;
" I much obleeged for your very kind politeness !" she remarked,&#xD;

GRANDMOTHER RIGGLESTX.&#xD;
with grisly sarcasm. " Had 't I better pay ye suthin' for yer&#xD;
trouble ? "&#xD;
The Englishman's sense of the humorous getting the better of his&#xD;
mortification, he told her gravely that he would consider fourpence&#xD;
a fair compensation.&#xD;
"I declare," she stammered, looking blank and perplexed, "4I_&#xD;
hardly expected ye 'd make a charge on't-- but I'm sure,"-she&#xD;
fumbled in her purse, -" if three- cents would be an object.-Git&#xD;
out! you nasty thing!"- to Rover, who ran out, barking, and&#xD;
leaped upon her dress.- " Strange to me people will keep a&#xD;
yelpin' cur !'"&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury drove away whilst she was still fumbling for the&#xD;
change.&#xD;
"Good riddance.!" she muttered; " I should have begrudged&#xD;
him the fust cent; for he's a drinkin' man, and I'd know 't would&#xD;
go straight for liquor. Is this Phoebe?"&#xD;
" You 're my grandmother Rigglesty, an't you?" cried the&#xD;
delighted Phoebe, springing to kiss her venerable relation.&#xD;
"MY sakes! how you have growed, child !"  A smile thawed&#xD;
the old lady's hard visage a little on the surface, like spring sun-&#xD;
shine on frozen ground. "How 's mother an' Bim'lech?-Git&#xD;
out, you. sir !"-- to Rover, with a kick,-" tearin' that 'ore&#xD;
ban'box to pieces! There!"  -&#xD;

"Pups is the hatefulest critturs! an' I detest a yaller pup&#xD;

"Why did n't ye write to let us know you was coming? " cried&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood. "You thought you 'd take us by surprise, hey ?"&#xD;
"Why did n't I write?" echoed the old lady. "Don't none o'&#xD;
your folks ever go to the post-office, I wonder?  Bim'lech was&#xD;
allus jes so slack, and allus will be, to the day of his death, fu'a&#xD;

"Mother, let Bin go right down and get it," cried the mor-&#xD;
tified Phoebe.&#xD;
"It '11 do a sight o' good to send for 't now! Bim'lech may&#xD;
tackle up an' go for my things, though, as soon as ye please. Do&#xD;
shet the door arter ye !" to Phoebe, who ran out to call her father.&#xD;
" I'm in a perty state to set in a draft of air ! You 'Il have to&#xD;
larn to shet doors arterye, if I stay here."&#xD;
Seated in the rocking-chair, in the kitchen, the old lady took an&#xD;
unfinished stocking from her bag, and began to knit industriously.&#xD;
Presently she paused, ceased rocking, closed her eyes and opened&#xD;
her mouth, scowling and drawing in her breath, as if to provoke a&#xD;
sneeze. Having succeeded in getting off a powerful double stern-&#xD;
utation, she hastened to huddle herself into the corner, looking&#xD;
peevishly about the r9om.&#xD;
"I 'm ketchin' cold, sure as this world ! I ben feelin' a draft&#xD;
on my neck ever sence I sot down; but I could n't tell, for the&#xD;
life o' me, where 't come from. I allus telled Bim'lech this was&#xD;

there 's never ben the fust thought o' repairs done on 't, I warrant,&#xD;
sence I was here : Bimi'lech 's so shif'lis ! "&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood: "0, wal, mother, we have to git along the&#xD;
best we can, yeoknow. We can't afford extravagance."&#xD;
Old lady: "But you might be decent and comf'table, 'tall&#xD;
events. Bim'lech was allus fussin' 'bout suthin' 't wasn't o' no-&#xD;
arthly kind o' use, while things 't ought to be 'tended to all went&#xD;
to loose ends. If you was right smart, and had your say 'bout&#xD;
things as you'd ought to have, things 'u'd look a little different&#xD;
round here, I tell ye!&#xD;
These remarks were interrupted by Phoebe and Bim, who came&#xD;
running a race to the house, followed, more soberly, by their father.&#xD;
"Dear me ! how rude ye be, childern !" cried the old .ldy,&#xD;
with a painful contortion of face. " You 're enough to take one's&#xD;

" Pheeb tickled my back, through the hole in my shirt, with a&#xD;

expression. " It goes through me jest like a knife !&#xD;

"Bim'lech, this is your gran'mother," said Mrs. Jackwood.&#xD;
" I know it," replied Bim, showing his teeth with a good-&#xD;
natured grin.&#xD;
"Why don't you speak to her, an' not be so boisterous?"&#xD;
"I d'n' know what to say," said the boy, lowering his voice,&#xD;
and looking sheepish.&#xD;
"Can't ye gi' me, a sweet kiss, now? "asked the old lady, lay-&#xD;
ing her knitting on her lap; " Phoebe did."&#xD;
Abimelech, giggling: " I do' wanter!"&#xD;
Old lady: "You d'n' know what I got for ye in my chist !&#xD;
Mebby it 's a jack-knife, now, - who knows ?"&#xD;
The toy was almost persuaded; but, somehow, he could not&#xD;
discover anywhere on the old lady's face a spot smooth enough to&#xD;
kiss, except the tip of her nose; so he concluded not to indulge.&#xD;
He .afterwards had no occasion to regret his self-denial, the re-&#xD;
puted jack-knife in the old lady's chest turning out to be a&#xD;
complete hoax.&#xD;
Old lady, resentfully : " Wal, you 're a notty boy, -an' notty&#xD;
boys don't git no presents. -How do you do, Bim'lech ? " reach-'&#xD;
ing out her hand to Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
Mr. Jaokwood greeted her heartily ; and how was she herself ?&#xD;
"0, I an't a bit well,",-releasing his hand immediately, and&#xD;
resuming her knitting. "An' more 'n all that I never expect to&#xD;
be.  My constitution 's all broke to pieces.  I 've a dre'ful&#xD;
rheumatiz. An' what 's wus 'n all, there 's nobody in this&#xD;
world 't has the least mite o' charity for me, or pity on my suf-&#xD;
ferin's."&#xD;
Taking from her bag a cotton handkerchief, embellished with a&#xD;
print of the Good Samaritan, she wiped her eyes on it, and put it&#xD;
back again. -Then, observing that everybody was very much dis-&#xD;
tressed, she assumed an air of grim satisfaction over her knit-&#xD;
ting.&#xD;
" Wal, wal, gran'mother," said Mr. Jackwood, sympathetically,&#xD;
"you 'II have your reward; if not here, herearter."&#xD;
" I'ye giv' up expecting anything in this life," she' whimpered,&#xD;

" I han't a child in the world, but that wishes me out o' the&#xD;
way,   for I an't nothin' but a burden now to nobody !"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood: "Don't, mother, talk so, an' give way to your&#xD;
feelin's!"&#xD;
Old lady: "0, wal, if I distress people, I s'pose I mus' n't.&#xD;
It 's the duty of ol' people to give up, when they've wore them-&#xD;
selves out in doin' for their childern; it's a sin to speak on 't, or&#xD;
complain. 0, wal," -drying her eyes on the Good Samaritan,&#xD;
"I'll be more keerful in futur'."&#xD;
Finding the scene too painful, Mr. Jackwood went out to har-&#xD;
ness the horse, in order to go for the old lady's baggage.&#xD;
"I 'm real sorry she 's come here to stop," said Bim. "We&#xD;
can't have no fun while she's around."&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood: "Hush up ! You mus' n't talk so. It 's your&#xD;
duty to love her, an' make things pleasant for her."&#xD;
Abimelech: "How can a feller ? -Say, Pheeb! "-to his&#xD;
sister, who ran out to speak for some "best green tea" from the&#xD;
grocery, for theold lady's use -- " how do yiod like her ?"&#xD;
Phoebe, in a disappointed tone : "I was in hopes she 'd be real&#xD;
good and cosey ! I could done anything for her, if she was like&#xD;
Bertha Wing's gran'mother - but I don't like her a bit; so,&#xD;
there !"&#xD;
" Tut, tut! " said Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
The old lady had by this time discovered a strange face through&#xD;
the half-open door of the adjoining room.&#xD;
" Who is that crittur ?" she demanded. " What's her name?&#xD;
What 's she here for?"&#xD;
"Her name is Charlotte Woods," whispered Mrs. Jackwood,&#xD;
closing the door. " -She was travellin', an' lost her way, somehow,&#xD;
when father found her and brought her home."&#xD;
" Fiddle-stick's eend! That 's jest like yoig 'n' Blim'lech, now&#xD;

58              GRANDMOTHER RIGGLESTY.&#xD;
to take in every straggler comes along! Do you know anything&#xD;
about her ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood only knew that Charlotte had proved herself&#xD;
honest, and "willin' to do." Besides, she appeared to have under-&#xD;
gone so many trials and hardships, that they --the Jackwoods,&#xD;
not the trials and hardships -were "re'ly gittin' quite attached&#xD;
to her."&#xD;
"Hum-drum !" ejaculated grandmother Rigglesty. "Them's&#xD;
your notion's ! Bring the crittur' out here,  and le' me look at her !"&#xD;
Charlotte had been found to possess a skill in ornamental nee-&#xD;
dle-work ; and she was now busily engaged on some nice sewing&#xD;
for Phoebe, which, in her ardor to do something to gratify her&#xD;
friends, she was unwilling to leave until finished ; but, on being&#xD;
informed of the old lady's desire for an introduction, she put her&#xD;
work aside, and arose to accompany Mrs. Jackwood.&#xD;
"iYou must be prepared to put up with her odd notions. You'll&#xD;
do that for my sake."&#xD;
"What would I not do for your sake?" said Charlotte. "You&#xD;
have been so kind to me !"-&#xD;
"0, wal, I mean to do as I'd be done by," replied Mrs. Jack-&#xD;
wood, with suffused features. " The best miss it sometimes; I&#xD;
know I do; -an' we must have charity one for another. I hope&#xD;
you'll have -charity for her; she 's got well along in years, an'&#xD;
there 's no denyin' 'but she 's had a many things to try her. Le'&#xD;
me take your work along: that 'll please her."&#xD;
Charlotte herself, one would have thought, must please the&#xD;
most fastidious of grandmothers. Mrs. Rigglesty, however, re-&#xD;
garded her only with a scrutinizing scowl.  The girl's counte-&#xD;
nance fell : a phenomenon the old lady construed at once into a&#xD;
demonstration of guilt.- Then she asked a number of sharp, hard&#xD;
questions, which Charlotte could not answer without embarrass-&#xD;
ment: another indication that she was a deceitful character.&#xD;
Phobe thought to give matters a pleasant turn, by calling atten-&#xD;
tion to the needle-work.&#xD;
" Heugh!" grunted the old lady; "that's a fine way to waste&#xD;
one's time ! Time 's money ; -did ye know it, child ? Say ! did&#xD;
ye know it ? " - with a disagreeable look at Charlotte.&#xD;
&#xD;
GRANDMOTHER RIGGLESTY.                 59&#xD;
"It is sometimes better than money, I think," replied Char-&#xD;
lotte.&#xD;
"Better 'n money ?', echoed grandmother Rigglesty. You&#xD;
would have thought her some amazed and indignant female in-&#xD;
quisitor, examining a fair heretic. "Better 'n money?  What&#xD;
on 'arth d' ye mean by that?"&#xD;
The timid girl shrank from making any -reply ; but, being&#xD;
pressed, she drew herself up, with a grace and dignity which de-&#xD;
lighted Phoebe, and answered, modestly, that, while she thought&#xD;
time should not be wasted, she deemed it too precious to be coined&#xD;
up, every hour and minute, into gold.&#xD;
" And what would ye 'do with 't?  Le' me look !"t The old&#xD;
lady snatched the collar from Phoebe's hand. " 0, I see ! -sar-&#xD;
castically. " This is very farcical ! But what does the Scriptur's&#xD;
say 'bout vanities ? You'd better enoughh on 't be to work on&#xD;
sauthin' useful."&#xD;
Charlotte had no word to offer; but, with a swelling heart and&#xD;
quivering lip, she took her work, and quietly withdrew.&#xD;
"You may depend on't," exclaimed the old lady, "she's a&#xD;
dangerous person to have round. I should a' had my suspicions&#xD;
on her, see her where I would. That guilty look - that guilty&#xD;
look ! "-- with a grimace. "Don't tell me 'bout that gal's hon-&#xD;
esty!"&#xD;
" I think she 's }a perfect beauty !" cried Phoebe.&#xD;
" Beauty, skin deep! " sneered grandmother Rigglesty. "Gals&#xD;
of her character gene'lly have 'nough o' that. ,-ut, if your mother&#xD;
knows what is good for you, miss, she 'll send the crittur' away&#xD;
from here, mighty quick!"&#xD;
"Mother won't send her away-I don't believe!" said Phoebe,&#xD;
in an under-tone.&#xD;
" What 's that ? " demanded the old lady. "Don't handle&#xD;
them dishes so keerliss; you '11 break 'em, next you know! -&#xD;
WhatI's that you 're mutterin'?"&#xD;
" '11 handle the dishes just as carelessly as I please ! " de-&#xD;
clared Phobe, in the same indistinct utterance.&#xD;
"You want me to train ye a little while, miss ! I'd. larn ye&#xD;
to mutter when you 'me spoke to !"&#xD;

Mrs. Jackwood: "Phobe !"&#xD;
Phoebe, pouting: "I don't care! I 'd take Charlotte's part,&#xD;
if all the world was ag'inst her!"&#xD;
Old'lady, whimpering: "Wal, wal! I. expect sich treatment,&#xD;
an' I must put up with 't.! I see I an't wanted here !"-more&#xD;
tears, and the Good Samaritan again; "- my own darter's dar-&#xD;
ter sasses me to my face ! Wal, wal! I'm an ol' woman, an'&#xD;
't an't no matter!"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood reproved Phoebe severely; and the girl herself,&#xD;
touched with compunctions, declared that she did not intend to&#xD;
hurt anybody's feelings, and asked to' be forgiven. This was a-&#xD;
triumph, upon themstrength of which the old lady and the Good&#xD;
Samaritan enjoyed a most confidential and tearful season, until&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood and Bim entered with the baggage, and the family&#xD;
sat down to supper.&#xD;
At the table, Mrs. Rigglesty manifested a healthful resentment&#xD;
of insults, by refusing to accept any food at the hands of the&#xD;
unforgiven Phoebe, and waiting, with an injured expression, to-be&#xD;
served by either Mr. Jackwood or Betsy.. To add still further to&#xD;
the general comfort, she significantly hitched her chair away from&#xD;
Charlotte's, and gathered up the skirts of her bombazine with vir.&#xD;
tuous care, as if to avoid all contact or compromise with-so ques-&#xD;
tionable a person.&#xD;
It was the first time Charlotte had been present at an unsocial&#xD;
meal in Mr. Jackwood's house. Her heart was full; she could&#xD;
not eat; for already she saw that her evil genius -if such things&#xD;
are -had reappeared, after a brief respite, in the form of a grim.&#xD;
old grandmother, who would not rest until she was once more&#xD;
driven forth into the shelterless and stormy wastes of life.&#xD;
" What a queer dream I had!" said Phoebe, as she awoke, on&#xD;
the following, morning. "I thought gran'mother was an ele-&#xD;
phant, with a long stocking over her nose for a trunk, and Bim&#xD;
rode into meeting on her backtL Was n't it funny ?"&#xD;
Charlotte smiled wearily.&#xD;
"Why,-what's the matter?   How pale you look! Are you&#xD;
sick ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
GRANDMOTHER RIGGLESTY.                61&#xD;
"No," replied Charlotte; " but I have not slept well."&#xD;
"It 's all owing to granny-I don't care if I do call her&#xD;
granny !" exclaimed Phoebe. "But you need n't let her worry&#xD;
you a bit. What if she did say she was going to stay here all&#xD;
summer? I'Ill fix it so 'st she won't want to stop a week. I '11&#xD;
do everything I can to plague her ! "&#xD;
"No, no, Phobe," answered Charlotte. "Be kind to her, -&#xD;
and I will endeavor to be patient,-and perhaps all will be&#xD;
well."&#xD;
Even while she spoke, that vague presentiment of coming&#xD;
trouble, which had gathered, like a cloud over her heart, dark-&#xD;
ened more and more, and she could see no light beyond.&#xD;
They had grandmother Rigglesty again for breakfast.&#xD;
"0 dear !" sighed the old lady, declining into the rocking-&#xD;
chair, "I don't think I shall 'burden anybody much longer!&#xD;
Them that's so anxious to git red o' me 'll have their wish soon&#xD;
enough, at this rate. Jest look at my tongue, Betsy; did ye ever&#xD;
see sich a tongue, in all your life? I had a dreadful nightmare,&#xD;
last night. Did n't anybody hear me groan? Wal, it's a blessin'&#xD;
to sleep sound, 'specially when an ol' person -like 'me, that an't o'&#xD;
no arthly 'count to nobody, is in distress. -'T would n't be wuth&#xD;
while to disturb young folks, though it might save my life jest to&#xD;
pull my little finger, when I have them horrid nightmares. Wal,&#xD;
it is to be expected 't every smooth-spoken erittur 't comes along,"&#xD;
- turning her back to Charlotte, -"will have attention paid&#xD;
'em, while a poor ol' body, that-'s slaved the life out of her for her&#xD;
childern,- wal, no matter !"&#xD;
Observing that her complaints had produced their legitimate&#xD;
effect, in making all around her unhappy, Mrs. Rigglesty found it&#xD;
necessary to send to the spare bed-room for the Good Samaritan,&#xD;
whom she had left rolled up under her pillow. That ancient&#xD;
comforter being brought, she communed with him over her plate,&#xD;
until everybody's appetite appeared reduced to the same low con-&#xD;
dition with her own. Rallying a little at this, she made a feeble&#xD;
attempt upon the breakfast, but declared that even the tea had a&#xD;
disagreeable taste.&#xD;
"0O, wal, I may asswell give up eatin' entirely. Folks don't&#xD;

have sich hulsome victuals, now-days, as they use' to. Every-&#xD;
thing turns my stomach."&#xD;
As she sat back in her chair, sighing, and stirring her tea with&#xD;
a desolate expression, Phoebe left the table, and stood pouting at&#xD;
the kitchen door.&#xD;
"I can't have that air blowin' on to me !" cried Mrs. Rig-&#xD;
glesty. " My shawl is off my shoulders, too ! I'm all over&#xD;
aches, a' ready, from the sole o' my head to the crown o' my foot!&#xD;
Sich a pain all through the back o' my neck as I woke up with this&#xD;
morning' ! nobody can  never know nothin' 't all 'bout it ! I can&#xD;
twist my'head so," -she turned it towards her right shoulder, -&#xD;
" but,"-turning it in the same way towards her left, -" I can't&#xD;
twist it so, for the life o' me. An' every time I move it I have to&#xD;
scream right out, as if you 'd cut me with a knife ! Ou!"&#xD;
Thereupon Rim laughed till he choked, and rushed headlong&#xD;
from the table, with the milk he had been drinking running out&#xD;
of his nose.&#xD;
Thus' a change comes over Mr. Jackwood's house.&#xD;
Charlotte is not the only sufferer, though the greatest. From&#xD;
the elder Jackwood down to the hopeful Bim, all are subject to&#xD;
the sway of the despotic grandmother. With the Good Samari-&#xD;
tan for her prime minister, she reigns supreme, - her knitting-&#xD;
work her sceptre, the rocking-chair her throne. Phoebe dares&#xD;
but whisper sedition, while not even Bim has courage openly to&#xD;
rebel.&#xD;
Grandmother Rigglesty has. early declared her intention to&#xD;
revolutionize things a little. The first article in her code is -&#xD;
work. She cannot endure aught.'that savors of idleness. Even&#xD;
the senior Jackwood she spurs to a more rigid economy of time.&#xD;
The long noonings he so much enjoys fill her with amazement&#xD;
and distress. So much precious time wasted ! such careless-&#xD;
ness of worldly gain ! 't would be enough, she says, to try the&#xD;
patience of Job. She cannot,.it is true, order Mr. Jackwood to&#xD;
go about his business in so many words; but she can whip the&#xD;
father over the convenient shoulders of the son. So, after dinner,&#xD;
Bim - to use his own expression --" has to take it."&#xD;
&#xD;
GRANIMOTRER RIGGLESTY.                 63&#xD;
"Sonny," calls grandmother Rigglesty from her throne.&#xD;
" What?" snarls Bim, who hates to be called sonny.&#xD;
"W-h-a-t ?  Is that the way to answer?  You han't had me&#xD;
to lam  ye manners, or ye would n't speak so ! WHAT !- Come&#xD;
here, an' you '1l know what ! "&#xD;
Bim, who is engaged in putting together the frame of a&#xD;
small wagon, under the stoop, kicks off one of the wheels vindic-&#xD;
tively, and comes forward, with fiery looks, to learn his sentence.&#xD;
Old lady, coaxingly : "Don't ye want to hold this yarn for me&#xD;
to wind?-that's a good boy !"&#xD;
Abimelech, scowling fiercely: "I knowed there'd be suthin'&#xD;
for me to do!"&#xD;
" Wal, you be an abused child, I must say for 't !  You want&#xD;
born to work, was ye?"&#xD;
"No, by darn, I want!   And. I an't goin' to work every&#xD;
minute o' the time, if I haf to run away ! "&#xD;
"Does your father hear that ? "&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood, tipped back in his chair by the door, enjoying&#xD;
a comfortable smoke, perceives that he is expected to interfere.&#xD;
" Bim'lech!" - in a warning tone, - " don't le' me hear no&#xD;
more o' that !"&#xD;
Old lady: "It does a great deal o' good to correct a child that&#xD;
way ! A child o' mine would n't a' got off so easy ! "&#xD;
~ Mr. Jackwood, with a transparent frown : " Be a good boy,&#xD;
now, or I shall take ye in hand.&#xD;
The old lady, sneezing, adjusts the yarn to the boy's hand.&#xD;
Abimelech, submitting with a bad grace : "Wind fast, any way!&#xD;
Old lady: " You need n't be so uppish 'bout it ! 'T won't hurt&#xD;
ye to hold yarn a little while."&#xD;
"Father takes a noonin', and why can't I?"&#xD;
" If he does, I don't ! *'I never think of sich a thing. - I never&#xD;
brought up my childern to sich lazy habits, nuther."-- Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood winces. - "lHan't your father nothin' in the world for you&#xD;
to do?"&#xD;
"I should think so ! There an't a boy nowheres round here&#xD;

Old lady, losing patience: "Dossee that boy! I wish the&#xD;

GRANDMOTHER RGGLE.TY.                  65&#xD;
rare ingenuity in discovering occasions for the exercise of her&#xD;
reformatory spirit. The sink-pump is so noisy that it "jumps&#xD;
right through her bones," when any one goes to it for water. The&#xD;
pig-pen is too far from the house, the stables too near. The&#xD;
stove-oven is the " wust thing " to bake short-cake. in ever&#xD;
invented. Then, there are those "plaguy turkeys and chickens,"&#xD;
dodging into the kitchen a hundred times a day ! A still greater&#xD;
annoyance is the dog Rover. Him she neglects no opportunity&#xD;
to cuff or kick. When he is lying quietly under the stove, she&#xD;
puncheth him with the broom-handle, she pincheth him with the&#xD;
tongs. And when all these subjects of complaint are exhausted&#xD;
for the day, she falls back upon her lame shoulder, pities herself&#xD;
to tears, and has recourse to the Good Samaritan.&#xD;
By some subtle logic of her own, not demonstrable- to common&#xD;
minds, the old lady connects all these afflicting circumstances&#xD;
with Charlotte, as their centre and source. "Things would go&#xD;
very different, if 't want for that upstart !" says grandmother&#xD;
Rigglesty. Whatever the evil complained of, - the poultry, the&#xD;
pump, the dog, or the laziness of Bim and the elder Jackwood, -&#xD;
her suspicious glances single out Charlotte as somehow guilty and&#xD;
responsible. Even her rheumatism, of twenty years' standing,&#xD;
seems mysteriously related to the same sinister cause.&#xD;
This treatment is insufferable. It leaves Charlotte no moment&#xD;
of peace. She feels impelled to leave her kind friends, to whom&#xD;
she perceives that her presence brings only discomfort and dis-&#xD;
tress. But Phoebe clings to her with all the vehemence of a&#xD;
girlish attachment ; end Mr. and Mrs. Jackwood; out of the&#xD;
sympathy of their hearts, afford her what consolation and encour-&#xD;
agement they can.&#xD;
Thus a week goes by; when one day there coipes a crisis Under&#xD;
pretence of making a critical investigation of Betsy's cheeses,&#xD;
the old lady muffles herself in her shawl, ascends the chamber&#xD;
stairs with painful steps, and, having taken care to divert sus-&#xD;
picion from her real purpose by sneezing loudly five or six times;,&#xD;
and rattling the empty boards on the shelves, in the cheese-room,&#xD;
glides softly and stealthily into the girls' bed-chamber.&#xD;
Grandmother Rigglesty is. possessed of: an inquiring turn of&#xD;

mind. She taketh delight in all those little discoveries and sure&#xD;
prises incidental to ruimnaging other people's boxes and drawers;&#xD;
and it is this praiseworthy interest in her neighbors' affairs that&#xD;
attracts her eager fingers to Phoebe's letter-box, then to the&#xD;
bureau and closet. With what vivid enjoyment she scrutinizes&#xD;
every. garment, trinket, and silly school-girl note ! But, like all&#xD;
earthly pleasures, this of ransacking is transient and unsatisfac-&#xD;
tory. Arrived at the furthest obscure corner of the clothes-room,&#xD;
she is ready to weep like Alexander when he had no more&#xD;
worlds to conquer. She turns, and in the dark hits her head&#xD;
against the low roof. Incensed, she peers around, as if to see&#xD;
what audacious rafter inflicted the knock., Ha! what 's this?&#xD;
Something carefully folded. and put away over the beam.  She&#xD;
drags it out ; she holds it up to the light ; she turns it over, and&#xD;
around, and inside out.   .&#xD;
"Sakes . alive !" grumbles grandmother Rigglesty, "what 's&#xD;
here ? An ol' merino, sure 's I live ! Betsy never had sich a&#xD;
gown!". Turning it again.     ".It can't be Phoebe's."  Still&#xD;
another turn.  "It "-the old lady's features contract-- "it 's&#xD;
that crittur's!"     S&#xD;
With renewed curiosity, sharpened by malice, she searches for&#xD;
pockets ; and, finding one, explores it eagerly.&#xD;
" What on 'arth!"-drawing forth her hand. A small package&#xD;
a brought to the light, and she makes haste to undo it. --" An&#xD;
ol' woman's cap!" splutters grandmother Rigglesty; "gray&#xD;
hair !"-still greater   astonishment, -" and  spectacles !-&#xD;
Marcy on me ! It all comes to me as clear, as day! cap, specta-&#xD;
cles, an' all !"&#xD;
Without pausing to reflect that she is about to expose her own&#xD;
dishonett= intermeddling, down stairs she hurries, and, bursting'&#xD;
into the kitchen, displays her trophies.&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood, taking a custard-pie from the oven, drops it&#xD;
upon the nearest chair, and regards her mother with amazement.&#xD;
The latter, in. her excitement, has placed the spectacles on her&#xD;
own nose, where they tremble with the agitation which shakes her&#xD;

"What 's the matter ?" cries Mrs. Jackwood.&#xD;
Charlotte sits dreamily plying her needle by the window, when,&#xD;
aroused by the sudden burst of the storm, she looks up, and per-&#xD;
ceives at a glance what has occurred. The color leaves her cheek,&#xD;
but, without a word, she bows her head over her work, and waits&#xD;
patiently for the commotion to pass.&#xD;

"I 've seen it before," observed Mrs. Jackwood, - "han't I?&#xD;
Why, it 's Charlotte's."&#xD;
" I seen it 'fore you ever did!" cries grandmother Rigglesty.&#xD;
" A stragglin' woman stopped to Jacob's, down-to Sawney Hook;&#xD;
an' she wore this very same gown, an" spectacles, an' false hair,&#xD;
I can take my oath !  I was sick a-bed, or she wouldn't a' got&#xD;
off as she did. I knowed she was an impostor, the minute I set&#xD;
eyes on her ; but Jacob would n't hear to 't ; an' now it all turns&#xD;
out jest as I said. 'T was this crittur-! Look up, here; how&#xD;
green ye look ! "- as if the ' phenomenon were Charlotte's fault,&#xD;
and not that of the colored glasses. " What ye got to say for&#xD;
yerself, hey ? "&#xD;
Slowly Charlotte raises her head, and puts back her dark hair&#xD;
from her face. All pale, and cold, and self-subdued, with a thrill-&#xD;
mg beauty in her aspect, she fixes her eyes upon the angry dame.&#xD;
" I can make no explanations," - she speaks gently, but there&#xD;
is a quick quiver of passion in her lip,-" only to those who have&#xD;
trusted me," tears rush to her eyes as she turns to Phebe&#xD;
and her mother; " I would say this, from a true and grateful&#xD;
heart - that I have not willingly deceived ; but it is my misfor-&#xD;
tunes that have brought me here, and made me what I am."&#xD;
Phoebe, vehemently: "I believe you; I believe every word&#xD;
you say!" throwing her arms about Charlotte's neck. "And I&#xD;
wish folks would let you alone, and mind their own business!"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood, agitated: "Phobe! Phoebe!"&#xD;
Grandmother Rigglesty : " You -yoi-5ou sassy thing !"&#xD;
Phoebe: " I don't caue! 1I'11 stad up for Charlgtte Mw m&#xD;

last breath. I only wish some folks who treat her so, and pretend&#xD;
to be Christians, were half as good as she is ! "&#xD;
The old lady infuriate; Mrs. Jackwood, fluttering, tries to make&#xD;
peace; while Charlotte, touched by Phoebe's devotion, clasps her&#xD;
in her arms, and weeps upon her shoulder.&#xD;
The arrival of Mr. Jackwood, with Bim and the dog, is oppor-&#xD;
tune. He is just in time to support the old lady, who totters&#xD;
backward in a fit, the moment she perceives somebody near to&#xD;
catch her. The fit is generally supposed to be feigned. At all&#xD;
events, either from habit or otherwise, that remarkable woman&#xD;
finds it in her way to bestow a kick upon Rover, who, forgetting&#xD;
his usual precaution, in the general excitement, approaches his&#xD;
enemy just as the elder Abimelech eases her down upon a chair.&#xD;
.  Younger Abimelech, through his teeth : " Bite her, Rove !"&#xD;
Rover, holding up one foot : " Ki-yi ! ki-yi !"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood, running for'the camphor, and stumbling over&#xD;
the dog: " Git out ! I never !"&#xD;
Grandmother Rigglesty, starting up wildly: "What am I set-&#xD;
tin' on? Marcy sakes ! if 't an't that bilin' custard ! "&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood, astounded: "If that don't beat all !"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood: "Strange you could n't see that pie, father !"&#xD;
The old lady totters towards the bed-room, dripping custard by&#xD;
the way.,&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood: " Don't se' down, mother ! I'll bring a towel."&#xD;
Bim, doubling up with mirth: "Goodie, goodie! "-possibly&#xD;
alluding to the pie.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood folds his hands behind him, and regards the con-&#xD;
sequences of the disaster with a look of consternation. Rover&#xD;
licks the spattersof custard from the floor and chair, and, timidly&#xD;
approaching the mass which was a pie,- now a crushed and smok-&#xD;
ing ruin, -snuffs and dodges as it burns his nose. Bim sprawls&#xD;
upon the floor, screaming with excessive laughter.&#xD;
Phoebe, excited : " I'm glad of it! ,She might 'let Charlotte&#xD;
alone!"&#xD;
Mr. Jack wood : " Don't speak so !"&#xD;
Phoebe; " I don't care, she 's no business to ! If she had n't&#xD;
h~eez meddling with what did n't belong to her, she would n't have&#xD;

found Charlotte's dress. What right has she got in our coset,&#xD;
1 'd like to know ?"&#xD;
"Never mind," says Mr. Jackwood, approaching Charlotte ;&#xD;
"I '11 make it all right ; I '11 stand by ye !"&#xD;
" Good Mr. Jackwood ! But I have brought you trouble&#xD;
enough already.  Let me go now; - I cannot stay here any&#xD;
longer."&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood, remonstrating, is interrupted by a knock at the&#xD;
front door. Rover growls. Bim runs to admit the visitor. Phoebe&#xD;
bustles about to destroy all traces of the custard catastrophe.&#xD;
Charlotte dries her eyes. Enter Mr. Dunbury.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood, cordially: "Good-arternoon, neighbor.  Take&#xD;
a cheer. Git out, dog !"&#xD;
Rover, leaping good-naturedly upon the proud Englishman's&#xD;
trousers, prints them with custard.&#xD;
Phoebe, flurried : " Put him out doors, Bim ! "-- meaning&#xD;
Rover, not Mr. Dunbury. "He 's had his feet in the pie."&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury, very red : " Don't mind ; no .damage done."&#xD;
His eyes rest upon Charlotte, bending over her work. Phoebe,&#xD;
who likes to introduce people, introduces her friend. The Eng-&#xD;
lishman regards the fair stranger with surprise.- Something in&#xD;
her face or manner commands his respect.. He rises politely, yet&#xD;
not without some embarrassment at meeting one of her appearance&#xD;
so unexpectedly, and, resuming his seat, instinctively places his&#xD;
hat over a hole in his left knee.&#xD;
At this juncture, grandmother Rigglesty, curious to learn who&#xD;
has come, enters and stands with her back towards the stove.. Re-&#xD;
cognizing an old acquaintance, she says " How de do ? " with an&#xD;
air of resentment, designed to impress him with the fact that she&#xD;
possesses a memory of wrongs.&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood, anxious to divert attention from the old lady;&#xD;
"How is Mrs. Dunbury to-day?"&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury: "She 's very low, again.  She will be better&#xD;
soon, however, I hope, for we expect Hector --"&#xD;
Phobe, with a start and a blush: "Hector!  Is he coming&#xD;
home ?"&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury : " He has written that he 'will be here to-nighit&#xD;

borrow your wagon to bring him down from the village."&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood: "Sartin, neighbor Dunbury; anything I've&#xD;
got, you 're welcome to."&#xD;
Charlotte, suffering greatly, and feeling ill at ease in the Eng-&#xD;
lishman's presence, escapes to her chamber, followed by Phoebe.&#xD;
" Only think, Charlotte !" cries the young girl, animated,&#xD;
" Hector Dunbury is coming to-night! He will go right by here.&#xD;
We 'Il be on the look-out, and see him."&#xD;
Charlotte, tenderly : " I would like to see your hero ; -yet,"&#xD;
-with a sad intonation,"-" he is nothing to me. Nobody is&#xD;
anything to me now, but you, Phoebe. And you, dear Phoebe!&#xD;
- I must leave you soon!"&#xD;
Poebe, with a frightened air: "What do you mean?  You&#xD;
an't Ding !"&#xD;
"Yes, dear child, I shall go-!  You must not oppose me,&#xD;
now !"&#xD;
Phoebe, frantically, at the head of the stairs: "Mother ! mother!&#xD;
-You shan't, you shan't stir out of this house to-night ! We&#xD;
won't let you!"&#xD;
"Phoebe, dear Phoebe !"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood, appearing presently, finds the two locked in a&#xD;
close embrace.&#xD;
"Mother, she says she is going ! Shall she ?  Tell father!.-&#xD;
He won't let her, I know."&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood offers sober counsel to dissuade Charlotte from&#xD;
her purpose.  Meanwhile, the excited Phoebe runs out, alarms&#xD;
the elder Abimelech, and brings him to the chamber.&#xD;
For once in his life, Mr. Jackwood's quiet spirit is roused. He&#xD;
declares that, before he will see Charlotte leave his roof, he will&#xD;
give the old lady her "walking-ticket," and ship her off to Sawney&#xD;
Hook by the morning stage, without any remorse whatever.&#xD;
"We've had enough of her pesky notions !" cries Mr. Abime-&#xD;
lech Jackwood ; and puts his foot down.&#xD;
Charlotte is more and more distressed. No, no ! he must not&#xD;
do that, she insists; and, to pacify her friends, she promises to&#xD;
reconsider her resolution, and remain with them until morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
GRANTDM0THEIR 1IGGLETT.71&#xD;
But reflection only confirms her ih the thought that it is her&#xD;
duty to go. Let what will betide, she cannot, -she, who has no&#xD;
claim upon her too kind friends, -she cannot be the cause of&#xD;
sending away from her own daughter's house even so unworthy&#xD;
and unwelcome a guest as grandmother Rigglesty.&#xD;
No, she herself must go, -- and quietly, too, to make the pain&#xD;
of parting all her own.  Accordingly, after passing a sleepless&#xD;
night, she rises in the still of the morning, dresses herself by the&#xD;
moonlight that lies so calmly in the chamber, imprints a kiss on&#xD;
Phoebe's lips, and drops a tear upon her cheek, without awaking&#xD;
her, and goes forth noiselessly from the house.  She wears the&#xD;
garments given her by her friends, carrying her own in a small&#xD;
bundle ; and, thus equipped to battle with the world, she sets out&#xD;
upon her journey amid a silence so solemn that there is some-&#xD;
thing strange and awful in the sound of her own light tread upon&#xD;
the soft dust of the road.                                             I&#xD;

VII.&#xD;
THE DUNBURYS.&#xD;
A FAINT whisper, and the feeble fluttering of a white hand on&#xD;
the pillow, called Bertha Wing to the bedside of her friend.&#xD;
" I thought I heard a wagon, - there, is not that my son's&#xD;
voice ?"&#xD;
Miss Wing had heard nothing; and the invalid sunk at once&#xD;
into despondency. At her request, -and mayhap to relieve her&#xD;
own anxious feelings,-Bertha resorted to the porch, and listened&#xD;
under the vines.  Hearing no sound of wheels, she walked out&#xD;
beneath the trees, and looked up the road. Still no Hector.&#xD;
It was now dusk. The evening was calm and clear. Over the&#xD;
western range of mountains the star of Love burned with a pale&#xD;
flame in the silvery sky, while in the east the yellow moon, half-&#xD;
risen, shone like a wide, luminous tent pitched behind the hills.&#xD;
Bertha saw the star, and the moon, and the shadows in the&#xD;
valley all around, and the fair vault of over-arching blue; and&#xD;
she gazed on all this beauty, until, no longer able.to control her&#xD;
woman's heart, which had been disciplined to suffer and be still&#xD;
through long years, she leaned her forehead against one of the&#xD;
maples by the fence, and wept.&#xD;
But she hastened to check her tears. She looked up and smiled,&#xD;
and said, "I will be strong!" At that instant, beneath the heaped-&#xD;
up foliage that towered above her, a bat flitted in zig-zag course&#xD;
athwart the gloom. It startled her, for she was looking for some&#xD;
fair omen whence to gather hope; and her eyes followed it with&#xD;
a sort of fascination, when, as it disappeared in the dusk, she.&#xD;
beheld, in the direction of its angular flight, the figure of a&#xD;
man-.&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DUNBUBYS.                      73&#xD;
Her first impulse was to escape ; but, on reaching the porch, she&#xD;
turned again, and met the visitor at the gate. It was Mr. Rukely,&#xD;
the minister. He greeted her with marked tenderness of manner,&#xD;
and inquired for Mrs. Dunbury.&#xD;
"Nothing but the hope of seeing Hector seems to sustain her,"&#xD;
answered Bertha, with a slight tremor in her tone.&#xD;
"Is Hector coming?" asked the visitor, surprised.&#xD;
"Yes ; he wrote that he would be here to-night,"-- Miss Wing&#xD;
dropped her eyes. "I think it will be well for his mother ; she&#xD;
pines for him, as if he were her life."&#xD;
Mr. Rukely looked troubled ; but she invited him to go in,&#xD;
and, passing ,under the porch, with-her hand in his, the cloud&#xD;
cleared from his brow; - yet could he not perceive that she&#xD;
shrank from him instinctively ; that while her understanding and&#xD;
her will were the two open arms that welcomed him, there was&#xD;
something deeper and stronger in her nature, that repelled him?&#xD;
Bertha took shame to herself that it was so. She sat by and&#xD;
heard him talk to her. invalid friend, and each noble word that&#xD;
fell from his lips dropped liI~e fire upon her rebellious heart.&#xD;
When he went away, she accompanied him to the porch, and&#xD;
pressed his hand with strange earnestness at parting.&#xD;
Forgive me! forgive me! " she said, in deep humility.&#xD;
"Forgive ?" repeated Mr. Rukely, with a benevolent smile.&#xD;
"For what ?"&#xD;
Bertha: "Why is it that I could never appreciate you?&#xD;
Surely, surely, if I loved only the good and the true, my natural&#xD;
heart would never have rebelled, when reason said, 'Love !'&#xD;
Mr. Rukely, with hopeful interest : " Does it rebel now ?"&#xD;
Bertha, very faintly : " No, not now."&#xD;
But Bertha could not look up, to return his cordial. "good-&#xD;
night ; " and when she raised her eyes, he had passed the gate.&#xD;
Then again, as before, the ominous bat flitted athwart the gloom,&#xD;
and disappeared, flapping around the minister's black hat.&#xD;
Bertha returned to the bedside of her friend, and buried her&#xD;
face in the pillows.&#xD;
"What is it, my poor girl ?" asked Mrs. Dunbury, "Let me&#xD;
know -all your grief."&#xD;

74                    TIE DUNBURYS.&#xD;
Bertha sobbed. -  " Has God forsaken me?  Can He withhold&#xD;
His light and strength from one whose only prayer is to serve&#xD;
Him  aright?  I sometimes think so ; else why, in all my strug-&#xD;
gles -"&#xD;
She checked herself. She had spoken wildly ; she was afraid&#xD;
she lad blasphemed. Unwilling to impose her burdens on her&#xD;
friend, she arose, and endeavored to forget her sorrows in offices of&#xD;
charity.&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury had been sustained by an inter 'st in the girl's&#xD;
sufferings; but now, when the-conversation turned upon her own&#xD;
condition, she sank at once. Hector would not come; all hope&#xD;
of recovering was past; and she assured Miss Wing, with pathetic&#xD;
earnestness, that she had but a few minutes to live.-&#xD;
Bertha was not much alarmed ; yet, pencil in hand, she sat&#xD;
down, with a serious face, to receive the mother's dying words to-&#xD;
her son.&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury was an English woman, of strong natural intelli-&#xD;
gence and fine sensibilities, ripened by culture in early life ; and&#xD;
misfortune and ill-health had not so far impaired her intellect, but&#xD;
her dying message evinced all the richness and grace of expression&#xD;
of her happiest days. Unfortunately, it vas never completed.&#xD;
Not that her spirit departed, but that Hector arrived.&#xD;
Bertha Wing dropped her pencil, and stood up, pale, and trem-&#xD;
bling in every nerve, as if she had seen an apparition; while Mrs.&#xD;
Dunbury, who had just composed herself to die comfortably, started&#xD;
up in bed, and cried out with joy. How different that cry from&#xD;
the late dying whisper !&#xD;
" Well, mother, you are glad to see the prodigal! " said Hec-&#xD;
tor, in a voice full of tenderness and cheer, when she had clung&#xD;
spasmodically to his neck for some seconds.  " Ah, Bertha ! is&#xD;
that you?"&#xD;
Bertha's conscious face became suddenly very red, and there&#xD;
was a slight trill of agitation in her voice, as she returned the&#xD;
greeting.&#xD;
"If mother would let go my hand, I would kiss you, Bertha!&#xD;
But, upon my word, I can't get away! !- How strong you are,&#xD;
mother! Sick ? -1 don't believe it ! Your pulse -as good a&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DUNBURYS.                     75&#xD;
pulse as anybody's!  our eye - I wish mine was half as bright !&#xD;
All you need is a little; stimulus."&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury, shaking her head: "0, but I have tried tonics&#xD;
faithfully !"&#xD;
Hector snapped his fingers: "So much for your tonics! This&#xD;
is what I mean," -prdssing her hand to his heart, -" sympathy,&#xD;
sympathy ! Confess to me that this is what you have wanted."&#xD;
" I know it is - I know it ! You make me a different being !&#xD;
Dear boy ! how my heart has yearned for you! You are my&#xD;
only hope and stay! Your father -your father!"-the inva-&#xD;
lid's voice faltered,-- " he needs you, too, my son. Promise me&#xD;
now - this night - that you will not leave us again."&#xD;
At mention of his father, Hector's head sank upon his breast;&#xD;
but, recovering himself, he looked up, pressing the invalid's hand.&#xD;
" 0, I shall not leave you in a hurry, mother ! I am glad to&#xD;
feel once more the peaceful influences of my old home. The&#xD;
woods, and streams, and mountains, and all the haunts of this&#xD;
most beautiful and tranquil of green valleys, will inspire me; and&#xD;
it seems as though I could spend years of happy quiet beneath&#xD;
this dear old roof: but the good Divinity that shapes our ends&#xD;
leads me by such unexpected paths, and flings open before me so&#xD;
many golden gates of surprise, that I dare make no definite plans&#xD;
for the future. I can promise nothing."&#xD;
Hector turned his fine eyes up with a look of aspiration, which&#xD;
thrilled his mother. At that moment, the shrill old clock rang in&#xD;
the adjoining room. Hector started.&#xD;
" The same venerable time-piece, my boy ! How many hours&#xD;
I have counted by that clock, in your absence, when every stroke&#xD;
has rolled an almost insupportable burden on my soul!-But I&#xD;
must not forget my drops. Bertha ran into the, other room: will&#xD;
you speak to her?"&#xD;
"Perhaps I can administer to you myself. Where are your&#xD;
drops? "-Hector turned to the vials and cups on the table. -&#xD;
"Merciful - mother ! what's all this?"&#xD;
"Those are my medicines. I. have been obliged to resort to&#xD;
quite a variety."&#xD;
Hector looked horrified: "Medicines! variety! death and de-&#xD;
struction !"&#xD;

'6                    THE DUNBURYS.&#xD;
"You frighten me, Hector. Don't, my son! Why do you&#xD;
look so strangely?"&#xD;
"Because I am exceeding wroth ! 0, what a native power you&#xD;
must have, to admit so many deadly enemies into\ the citadel of&#xD;
your constitution, and hold out against them all! Look you,&#xD;
dear mother, - I aspire to be your medical adviser for a few&#xD;
days. Will you accept me?"&#xD;
Such was Mrs. Dunbury's confidence in Hector, that she ac-&#xD;
ceded at once to his proposal.&#xD;
" And you engage to follow my directions?"&#xD;
"Willingly, -for I am sure my wise and generous son can do&#xD;
no wrong."&#xD;
At that moment, there was a crash.&#xD;
Hector, with a queer expression: " Cannot, eh ? Look there !"&#xD;
" Why, what hive you done ?"&#xD;
"Nothing,-only upset the table a little."&#xD;
" And the vials?"&#xD;
" Are smashed, mother' II '11 tell you how it happened. I&#xD;
thought I would give you a tune in place of a powder ; and, see-&#xD;
ing the flute on the book-case, I reached up -the table was in&#xD;
the way - I placed my knee gently and adroitly on the leaf, and&#xD;
-the result ! "&#xD;
Hector's good-nature was irresistible.&#xD;
" He was careful to put the lamp on the mantel-piece ! " said&#xD;
his mother to the dismayed Bertha. "So, we won't weep over the&#xD;
catastrophe. Call Bridget ; she will clear away the ruins."&#xD;
Bridget, getting on her knees: " It 's ahl on the ile-cloth,&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury. It did n't go a speck on the carpet."&#xD;
Hector, going: "I see the table is waiting, out there; and I&#xD;
have the appetite of a lion! The stage broke down under the&#xD;
mountain, we were .delayed three hours in a supperless wilder-&#xD;
ness, and I 've been the ill-tempered man you see me ever&#xD;
since. Nothing but toast and tea will cure me. Come, Bertha."&#xD;
After supper, Mrs. Dunbury called Miss Wing to her side, and&#xD;
astonished her.&#xD;
" I believe," said she, " I will sit up a little while, and have my&#xD;
bed made."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DUNBURYS.                      77&#xD;
Bertha, doubting her senses: " Sit up ! "&#xD;
Hector, advancing : "Why not?"&#xD;
Bertha: "She has not sat in a chair for five days!"&#xD;
Hector, dogmatically: " Can't help it!l Let her sit up half an&#xD;
hour."&#xD;
And she, who was so lately engaged in dictating dying mes-&#xD;
sages, was straightwayassisted to a chair.&#xD;
Meantime Hector, retiring to the sitting-room, and seating him-&#xD;
self at his mother's seraphine, near the open door, played " Sweet&#xD;
Home " with exquisite tenderness of expression.&#xD;
Bertha ran to him in haste : " She is crying ! I am afraid "--&#xD;
in a hurried whisper -" the music will weaken and depress her."&#xD;
Hector, striking up a plaintive Scotch air: " Have you no con-&#xD;
fidence in the new physician ?  Look you, Bertha ! if our patient&#xD;
asks for medicine, tell her Dr. Hector has not prescribed any.&#xD;
And if you know of any drugs, fluid, herb, or powder, -allo-&#xD;
pathic, homoeopathic, botanic, - harbored or concealed in this&#xD;
house, gather them up with affectionate care, ,and place them&#xD;
on the table convenient for being tipped over. Some accidents&#xD;
can happen as well as others !"&#xD;
With Hector's eyes upon her, with his lips so near her face, a&#xD;
strange trouble held poor Bertha as by a spell.&#xD;
"I am afraid," she answered, mechanically, "that your treat-&#xD;
ment will kill her."&#xD;
" Then let us take care that she dies a happy death! "&#xD;
Hector struck into an inspiring melody, full of laughter and&#xD;
tears, which ran somehow into the grand movement of a spirited&#xD;
march. He had not ended when, at a cry of alarm from Bertha,&#xD;
he looked up, and saw his mother, dressed all in white, approach-&#xD;
ing, with uplifted hand, like a somnambule. Nothing discon-&#xD;
certed, he fixed his eyes upon her bright, dilating orbs, and poured&#xD;
all the fire and energy of his soul into the concluding strains.&#xD;
The invalid's hand sank slowly, a smile flitted over her pale&#xD;
face, and she tottered forward. Hector caught her in his arms.&#xD;
A few minutes later, Bertha Wing, in the bed-chamber, heard&#xD;
a well-known touch: it was not Hector's: yet she, could scarce&#xD;

credit her senses, until she looked, and, behold! the invalid play-&#xD;
ing with all the grace and softness of her better days!.&#xD;
" Here, Bertha!!" cried the joyous Hector, when his mother&#xD;
had finished; "you may take our patient now, and put her to bed."&#xD;
Late that night, when all was still in the house, Hector left his&#xD;
chamber, and went forth into the open air. The full moon was&#xD;
shining through the door-yard trees.  In her calm light the&#xD;
dusky mountain slept, like a monster, with vast head and lofty&#xD;
shoulder traced upon the back-ground of the sky. The valley&#xD;
was still and cool. Willow clumps and shaggy elm-trees, dimly&#xD;
seen, marked the winding course of the creek. Towards this he&#xD;
wandered away in the silent night.&#xD;
But the old path, by which he used to stray, was overgrown.&#xD;
And the sloping turf beneath the butternut-tree, whereon he used&#xD;
to lie in the hot midsummer noons, and listen to the purling water,&#xD;
and the humming bees, -the dear old turf was gone; the freshet&#xD;
floods had lapped it away; and in its place appeared an abrupt&#xD;
bank, covered with high grass.&#xD;
The water that night sang the same old tune, but with a sadder,&#xD;
deeper meaning than of yore. Hector wept as he listened ; for in-&#xD;
that plaintive ripple what voices spoke to him out of the past !&#xD;
Rousing himself from these dreams, he was returning to his&#xD;
chamber, when, as he approached the porch, he heard a fluttering&#xD;
among the leaves, and saw a figure start up from the bench.&#xD;
"Don't be afraid, Bertha; it is I."&#xD;
How you frightend me ! I thought you asleep and dream-&#xD;
ing, by this time."&#xD;
"I have been dreaming, but not asleep, Bertha. 0, dreams,&#xD;
dreams! what would life be without them?" '&#xD;
"It would be better and happier," said Miss Wing.&#xD;
" That was spoken with a sigh, Bertha. Your dreams have&#xD;
been false, then, and you regret them?"&#xD;
" I do not regret them, for they have taught me useful lessons.&#xD;
But I am awake now, and shall dream no more."&#xD;
" Shake off this illusion of existence, then, for all who live are&#xD;
dreamers. Come, Bertha, sit down, and tell me your heart's his-&#xD;
&#xD;
Bertha, confusedly: "Yes, I am."&#xD;
"Once there was a flower, and it was afraid of the rain. Do&#xD;
you dislike me ? I think you did not in old times, - did you ? "&#xD;
" 0, no ! But you have been so long away -- "&#xD;
" I have become as a stranger ! But it should not be so. I&#xD;
have always cherished a tender remembrance of you. When I&#xD;
was a boy, you recollect, I fancied myself in love with little Ber-&#xD;
tha Wing. People laughed at me, because \you were older than&#xD;
I! Well, that is all past; and I have outgrown I don't know&#xD;
how many loves since ! I 'm a fickle wretch, Bertha ! - How you&#xD;
shiver ! Are you cold?"&#xD;
Bertha, in a strange tone : "The air is chill. Let me go in."&#xD;
Hector, kindly : " Go in, good Bertha. But give me that kiss&#xD;
you owe me. My mother held me; you know, and I could not&#xD;
claim the right of an old friend. -.What! so shy ?"&#xD;
Bertha, escaping: "Another time. Not now, -don't, Hector!"&#xD;
He loosed his hold, and the next moment stood alone under the&#xD;
porch.&#xD;
I I declare," thought he, as he bit his lip, - perhaps it itched&#xD;
a little, --" that girl is in love ! Some rogue has been trifling&#xD;
with her. Poor Bertha!"&#xD;
Hector sighed ; retired to his room; went to bed; remained as&#xD;
broad awake as an owl for three mortal hours; then, lapsing&#xD;
lightly into oblivion, slept till the crowing of the cock. Unable&#xD;
to close his eyes again, he turned his face to the window, and lay&#xD;
watching the brightening of the east through a notch in the moun-&#xD;
tains. First a few gray streaks; then a ruddy glow; and at&#xD;
last up came the sun, like a great fiery spider, on his web of&#xD;
beams.&#xD;
Up got Hector, also, pulled on his clothes, and, stepping out&#xD;
upon the balcony over the porch, inflated his lungs in the fresh&#xD;
morning air. Then he went down stairs, and, learning from Ber-&#xD;
tha thap his mother was awake, hastened to her chamber. He&#xD;
found her shedding tears.&#xD;
What now?" he cried.  " I just met Bertha, with a pair of&#xD;
red eyes, in the hall."&#xD;

"She thinks her services are no longer required here, and she&#xD;
is going away. .I am better, she says, -and you are here now&#xD;
to comfort me--"&#xD;
"But this is absurd! Ho, Bertha Wing! 'Come here, you&#xD;
trembling culprit ! Do you think you are going to leave us so?"&#xD;
Bertha: "I should be glad to stay,-- but W- it will be bet-&#xD;
ter -"&#xD;
She hesitated, blushed, and dropped her eyes before Hector's&#xD;
piercing look. Yet she was firm. Neither his persuasive elo-&#xD;
quence nor Mrs. Dunbury's tears could move her.&#xD;
It was-a sudden and unaccountable resolution on her part. Ah,&#xD;
nobody knew what pain, what prayers and tears, it had cost her !&#xD;
Had Hector guessed her secret, would he have opposed her ?&#xD;
After breakfast, Bertha, looking unusually pale, but with a&#xD;
small hectic spot on either cheek, quietly withdrew, put her&#xD;
things carefully together, and took leave of her friends.&#xD;
"Who would have thought so quiet a body as you could have&#xD;
such an iron will?" cried Hector.&#xD;
" When my duty is clear," said Bertha, -" but even then I&#xD;
am too easily influenced."&#xD;
"By those who can command you,-not by me, at all! -Well,&#xD;
good-by, mother ! Expect me back in an hour or two, and Ber-&#xD;
tha with me. I shall learn if she is wanted at home; and, if it 's&#xD;
as I suppose, we '11 only take a pleasant ride up the hill, and&#xD;
return to dinner."&#xD;
Bertha's home was high up on the mountain side. It was a&#xD;
beautiful drive up there, that bright summer morning. A little&#xD;
beyond Wild River, the mountain road branched out from the&#xD;
highway, crossed the valley, and wound its -snake-like course up&#xD;
the steep terraces and slopes of the western hills. The day was&#xD;
warm; the sunshine painted road and field; and often, toiling up&#xD;
the difficult ascent, the yoing man stopped his panting horse in&#xD;
some quiet dell, to let him breathe under the cool shade of road-&#xD;
side trees.&#xD;
The glory of the morning, and the beauty of the scenery, in-&#xD;
spired Hector ; a full joy flowed out of his soul, rippling and&#xD;
sparkling in words, and bathing his fine face.&#xD;
&#xD;
Bertha all the while held strongly upon the reins of her will;&#xD;
she mad herself outwardly cold and stony ; but, in spite of all, a&#xD;
sweet intoxication stole over her. She was glad when the pain of&#xD;
separation cane, and Hector helped her down at her father's house.&#xD;
It was a small wooden house, with a garden on the lower side,&#xD;
an orchard in the rear, with fields beyond, and the thick billowy&#xD;
foliage of green woods further up the mountain. A little gate&#xD;
opened upon a little path which led through a neat little yard to&#xD;
the door. Bertha and her friend were half-way in the enclosure,&#xD;
when an old lady came out to greet them.&#xD;
" Why, Bertha, is that you ? " she cried, shading her eyes with&#xD;
her fore-arm. "And if there an't Hector Dunbury ! Who ever&#xD;
expected to see you"! Did youjest rain down?"&#xD;
" I just reined up," replied Hector, shaking hands with the&#xD;
delighted old lady.&#xD;
Bertha led the way to her grandmother's room, - a small, com-&#xD;
fortable apartment, plainly furnished, with a bed on one side.&#xD;
Perceiving some one on the bed,.she looked inquiringly at the&#xD;
old lady.&#xD;
" Don't speak loud," said the latter; "'t would be a pity to&#xD;
wake her, - she seemed so tired apd troubled, when she laid&#xD;
down!"&#xD;
Who is it ?"&#xD;
"A poor gal, that 'pears to be travellin' a-foot an' alone, poor&#xD;
thing! She was goin' over the mountain, an' stopped for a drink&#xD;
o' water ; but she looked so pitiful, 't I went right to work an'&#xD;
made her a cup o' tea, an' some toast, an' gin her my bed to lay&#xD;
down on an' rest her, artery she 'd e't a mouthful, Poor thing !&#xD;
She dropped asleep, jest like a child. She must a' had a hard&#xD;
ja'nt this mornin' ! "&#xD;
Hector sat down in the door, and broached the subject of Ber-&#xD;
tha's return ; Bertha, meanwhile, laying off her bonnet and shawl&#xD;
with an air of gentle firmness, which sufficiently expressed her&#xD;
intention to remain where she was.&#xD;
"I tell ye what," said the old lady, "I 'm dre'ful L lonesome,&#xD;
days, when she 's away, - Susan an't so ,good as a pair o' tongs&#xD;
'°=   for company, - an' I guess you can git one o' Sam Fosdick's dar-&#xD;

rate, you drive up on the hill; an' if they an't willin' to go, n'ary&#xD;
one on 'em, pr'aps Bertha will. We '11 talk it over an' see, time&#xD;
you come along baqk."&#xD;
This was certainly a fair proposition; and Hector, jumping into&#xD;
the buggy, drove up to the dilapidated old house where Sam Fos&#xD;
dick's daughters lived. He found them all at home,-three tall,&#xD;
strong girls, yawning away the morning over a little work. They&#xD;
were slovenly dressed, not expecting company ; and his sudden&#xD;
appearance created a decided sensation. Without much ceremony&#xD;
he made known his errand.&#xD;
"I don' know," whined Mrs. Fosdick, a shrivelled, sour-&#xD;
faced, discontented woman, who sat picking over a dish of wormy&#xD;
peas, in the corner. " We an't sopoor 't our gals are obleeged to&#xD;
go out to work ; but it 's jest as they can agree. What do you&#xD;
say, 'Livia ? "&#xD;
Olivia, with a toss of her frizzled head : "I don't think I should&#xD;
be able to go. 'Patra can, if she 's a mind to."&#xD;
Cleopatra, hiding her naked feet under her chair : " I've no&#xD;
disposition, thank you, Miss Olivia ! 'Tildy may, if she likes."&#xD;
Matilda, simpering : "I have n't 'tended two terms at Kiltney,&#xD;
jest to learn that housework is my sphere ! "&#xD;
Hector, retreating: "Certainly not!  You will pardon my&#xD;
presumption.  Bridget does the housework, and the most mother&#xD;
wants is a companion -"&#xD;
Olivia, condescending : "O, if that is the case - "&#xD;
Cleopatra, interrupting her : " You an't going to change your&#xD;
mind, I hope, jest as I've concluded to go."&#xD;
Matilda:- " You both refused once; and now, if anybody goes,&#xD;
I think it ought to be me,  had n't it, ma?"&#xD;
Mrs. Fosdick : "'Tildy is very accomplished, and if it 's a com-&#xD;
panion your mother wants -"&#xD;
Matilda, unpinning her curl-papers: "'T won't take me ten&#xD;
minutes to git ready ! Why can't you help me, 'Patra ?"&#xD;
Cleopatra, independently, with several toes peeping from under&#xD;
her dress : "I I'm nobody's waiter, I 'd have you know, miss !"&#xD;
M~atilda : "I don't care,4divia will! "&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DUNBURYS.                      88&#xD;
Olivia, mockingly : " I don't care, 'Livia won't ! "&#xD;
Hector, with exemplary self-denial: " Excuse me, Miss Matilda,&#xD;
but I am really afraid you are making too great a sacrifice of&#xD;
feeling, and I am unwilling to remove you out of your sphere."&#xD;
He took leave politely. 'Tilda looked blank, 'Patra chuckled,&#xD;
'Livia tossed her frizzled head again ; and during the remainder&#xD;
of the forenoon, the three poor-and-proud sisters quarrelled sharply&#xD;
about the nice little apple of discord which had been dropped&#xD;
among them, and snatched away again before either could seize it.&#xD;
Diverted by the adventure, Hector returned to the other house.&#xD;
He was met by old Mrs. Wing at the gate.&#xD;
"I did n't much think you 'd git one on 'em," said she, " for&#xD;
they are pesky proud critturs, always for everlastin' settin' up for&#xD;
ladies !"&#xD;
" Whose horse is that under the shed ?" asked Hector.&#xD;
"It 's Mr. Rukely's ; he called at your father's, jest arter you&#xD;
left, and follered right along up the hill."&#xD;
"Mr. Rukely," - Hector scratched his ear, - " Mr. Rukely,&#xD;
Mr. Rukely! Are he and Bertha pretty good friends ?"&#xD;
"Dear me ! " whispered the old lady, all smiles ; "did n't you&#xD;
know it?  They 're engaged. They 're in the parlor now."&#xD;
"Phew-ew l" whistled Hector. "But who is that in your&#xD;
room?"&#xD;
"fIt's the gal 't you seen lyin' on the bed. An' I was goin' to&#xD;
tell ye, if your mother wants a nice, perty body to wait on her,&#xD;
she can't do better, I'think, than to take her. She turns out to&#xD;
be a gal that 's ben livin' to Mr. Jackwood's."&#xD;
" I wonder if ,she 's the person father saw there last evening !"&#xD;
exclaimed-Hector.&#xD;
He paused at the door, struck with sudden surprise. Notwith-&#xD;
standing his father's favorable report of Charlotte, he wasIalto-&#xD;
gether unprepared to see so peculiar and striking a countenance.&#xD;
The subdued passion and spiritual beauty of her face told her&#xD;
heart's history. The intuitive Hector felt a strange influence steal&#xD;
over him; and all her sorrows, the depth, the sweetness of her&#xD;
spirit, seemed revealed to him.&#xD;
On her part, she did not venture to return his earnest gaze.&#xD;
&#xD;

84                    THE DUNBURYS.&#xD;
But something in the tones of his voice startled her. It seemed&#xD;
to reopen suddenly, at her very feet, the dizzy gulf from which&#xD;
she had fled. She stole an anxious glance at his face; and in-&#xD;
stantly the blood rushed suffocatingly upon her heart, the room&#xD;
grew misty, and her head sank upon the bed near which she sat.&#xD;
"You are so tired, poor child-!" cried Mrs. Wing. " Le' me&#xD;
give you a little currant wine."&#xD;
She brought a bottle from her closet, poured a few spoonfuls of&#xD;
the liquid into a tumbler, and supported Charlotte's head while&#xD;
she drank.&#xD;
"You are very kind !" said the girl.  "I am better now, -&#xD;
thank you."&#xD;
Hector, with instinctive delicacy of feeling, had walked to the&#xD;
open door, and now stood with folded arms, gazing out upon the&#xD;
fair mountain scenery. This was a relief to Charlotte ; she made&#xD;
a strong effort to control herself, and appear calm; yet when he&#xD;
turned again, her spirit was' all weak and tremulous, like a reed&#xD;
bending under the weight of a bird.&#xD;
Hector, however, betrayed no sign of recognition. Hoping, but&#xD;
trembling still, Charlotte breathed an inward prayer that the&#xD;
old lady's proposal in her favor might be at once rejected. Hec-&#xD;
tor was but too eager to accept it. Then she endeavored, falter-&#xD;
ingly, to excuse herself; but he would not'consent to release her,&#xD;
and she saw no way left but to accompany him.&#xD;
Meanwhile, in the parlor, the conscientious Bertha confessed&#xD;
herself, in deep contrition of heart, to her indulgent friend.&#xD;
Mr. Rukely was somewhat disturbed. But he was none of your&#xD;
wild and capricious lovers. His passion lay tamely at the feet of&#xD;
his understanding, like an obedient spaniel, that never snapped or&#xD;
snarled. He pressed Bertha in his arms, and for the first time in&#xD;
his life, affianced though they were, kissed her - on the forehead.&#xD;
A cold revulsion of feeling made the unhappy girl shudder in&#xD;
his embrace. O, how wicked she thought herself, because her&#xD;
heart was stronger than her will ! But down she crushed that&#xD;
heart again, resolved anew to love what her judgment pronounced&#xD;
worthy.&#xD;
&#xD;

"It is a great relief," she said, "to have told you this ; and&#xD;
you are so kind ! I thought it would separate us forever ! "&#xD;
"No, Bertha," repeated the other, "it makes me love you the&#xD;
more. I respect your truth. You have fled from temptation ; you&#xD;
have shut your eyes and yoir ears against it; it is the only way."&#xD;
" The worst is passed," she said. "I conquered my love for&#xD;
him once ; why it returned upon me with such power, I cannot&#xD;
tell; but I have shut it out again, and forever."&#xD;
She walked mechanically to the window. Hector was helping&#xD;
Charlotte into the buggy. He seemed to hold her hand with a&#xD;
lingering pressure; his features beamed with satisfaction; he&#xD;
looked the very picture of manly grace. A quick, sharp pain&#xD;
shot through Bertha's heart as she gazed, and she turned away,&#xD;
stifling a cry of anguish, and shutting out the sight with her&#xD;
hands.&#xD;

VIII.&#xD;
DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.&#xD;
THE morning continued fine. The rays of the sun beat down&#xD;
hotly ; but cool breezes played upon the mountain side, shaking&#xD;
the green foliage of the woods, dancing over the meadows, and&#xD;
tossing the fields of grain into fantastic waves.&#xD;
A prospect of Alpine loveliness opened before, Hector and Char-&#xD;
lotte, as they emerged from a shady dingle not far from Mr.&#xD;
Wing's house. The road wound along the brow of a lofty spur,&#xD;
from which the valley, out-spread below, looked like a vast and&#xD;
magnificent map. The miniature fences, the spotted farms, the&#xD;
slender and winding streams, the houses so distant and so small,&#xD;
formed a picture of exceeding beauty. Still and grand rose the&#xD;
woody mountains beyond, the forests on their backs appearing like&#xD;
thick growths of weeds a mower might cut with his scythe. Here&#xD;
and there, amid clearings, along a dark chasm in the hills, gleamed&#xD;
the foam and silver of Wild River, rushing to the plain.&#xD;
Hector pointed out to his companion his father's house, Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood's, and two or three little villages nestled -in green spots&#xD;
up and down the creek. But, somehow, he could not talk to her&#xD;
as he had talked to Bertha. He could neither be frivolous nor&#xD;
sentimental.  Something in her character seemed to demand a&#xD;
tone of remark which a gentleman (Hector considered himself one)'&#xD;
could not, consistently with the views of society, freely address to&#xD;
a stranger in her position. Thus conscious of awkwardness, he&#xD;
contented himself with a few commonplace observations, and&#xD;
remained silent.&#xD;
Charlotte, on her part, feared to speak, lest her voice should&#xD;
betray what he had failed to discover in her face ; and she feared&#xD;
&#xD;
Iy&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.                    87&#xD;
to look towards him, lest something in her expression, not before&#xD;
revealed, should give form and substance to any vague shadow of&#xD;
recognition that might be flitting through his mind. Thus she&#xD;
was chiding and torturing herself for having consented to accom-&#xD;
pany him, when a catastrophe occurred,-which in a moment swept&#xD;
away every barrier of restraint that divided them.&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury kept a farm-boy, named Cornelius Boughton. His&#xD;
familiar appellation was Corny. He was seventeen years of age,&#xD;
and was distinguished for a meditative disposition, and a stoical&#xD;
indifference to the ordinary cares of life ; qualities which, it must&#xD;
be confessed, superficial observers were apt, indiscriminately, to&#xD;
term obtuseness and stupidity. Well, Corny had that morning&#xD;
harnessed the horse for Hector, and placed him before the buggy.&#xD;
He had also discovered that the spring which secured the eye of&#xD;
one of the traces in its hook was loose, and might drop off. It did&#xD;
not, however, occur to him. that a few seasonable strokes of the&#xD;
hammer might be of service in. preventing the dislocation of&#xD;
necks; nor did he mention the circumstance to Hector.&#xD;
Hector, accordingly, knew nothing of the danger, until, as he&#xD;
was driving down a gentle slope, he heard something rattle on the&#xD;
ground. It was the shafts, which had slid out of their stays, and&#xD;
fallen down, in consequence of the unhooking of that fatal trace.&#xD;
The horse jumped; one trace still held ; the buggy was brought&#xD;
violently against his gambrels ; a kick - a spring - and in an&#xD;
instant of time the frightened brute was making wild, irregular&#xD;
leaps down the declivity.&#xD;
Hector prided himself on his management of horses. Never,&#xD;
with the reins in his own hands, had he met with an accident.&#xD;
He did not lose his presence of mind; yet clear-headed, resolute,&#xD;
vigilant as he was, he could devise/ no way of averting a catas-&#xD;
trophe. If he held hard on the reins, he but drew the vehicle&#xD;
more closely upon the horse's heels ; and'to attempt to drive into&#xD;
the fence with the shafts on the ground, would have been certain&#xD;
destruction. He might, at the outset, have jumped out, and, by&#xD;
the exercise of superior agility, stopped both horse and wagon;&#xD;
but Charlotte clung to his arm, and held him fast.&#xD;
Hector had no fear for himself. his only care was 'for his&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8115-00000045"/>&#xD;
88                DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.&#xD;
companion. But for the tight clasp on his arm, he would have&#xD;
known nothing of the terror that froze at her heart. She did&#xD;
not scream, nor speak one word, from first to last ; and when, in a&#xD;
clear, firm voice, he told her what to do, it seemed the only way,&#xD;
and the right way, and she obeyed at once.&#xD;
The feat was difficult and dangerous.  Hector could not&#xD;
assist her; it required all his skill to manage the horse, and keep&#xD;
the shafts in the track. Not until he had given her ample time&#xD;
to save herself, did he venture to look around. She had climbed&#xD;
over the seat, and dropped down behind; and he had a momentary&#xD;
glimpse of her lying upon her face in the road, quite still, as she&#xD;
had fallen.&#xD;
All this happened in scarce more than a minute's time from&#xD;
the dropping of the shafts. Hector was now travelling at a speed&#xD;
that could not last long. He approached a curve in the road,&#xD;
and the track, which had offered little impediment to the shafts thus&#xD;
far, grew rough and stony. The buggy began to bound and reel;&#xD;
and, expecting momentlyy to go over, he prepared to throw the reins&#xD;
clear of everything, and fall in as compact a shape as possible, when&#xD;
the crisis arrived. Suddenly, looking before, to calculate his ground,&#xD;
he saw a man, scarce five rods distant, driving lazily up the moun-&#xD;
tain. He seemed asleep; his head was sunk upon his breast,&#xD;
the reins hung loosely in his hands. Hector rose up, bareheaded,&#xD;
his hair flying, and shouted the alarm. To the man, who started,&#xD;
bewildered from his nap, and saw swift ruin dashing down upon&#xD;
him in such a form, he looked more like a fiend than anything&#xD;
human. The poor fellow was horror-struck. It was too late for&#xD;
him to clear the track, but, with the instinct of terror, he screamed&#xD;
and 'shook the reins wildly up and down, -and finally threw his&#xD;
hat, to turn aside the danger. The frantic animal sheered to the&#xD;
bank; the shafts struck, and flew to splinters ; and the buggy,&#xD;
hurled into the air, doubled together like paste-board, and came&#xD;
down with a crash, a mass of fragments, throwing up dirt and&#xD;
turf into the very face of the spectator.&#xD;
The horse had cleared himself at a spring; but the driver lay&#xD;
among the ruins. How still everything was ! The man sat&#xD;
shivering in his wagon, and gazing with dumb amazement at the&#xD;
&#xD;
DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.                    89&#xD;
wreck, when he saw something move. Over went the broken&#xD;
seat, and up got Hector from under it.&#xD;
He was a frightful-looking object, covered from head to foot&#xD;
with dirt, his hair all over his face, and one sleeve of his coat&#xD;
rent away from the shoulder. At first he looked vacantly around,&#xD;
knowing not at all where he was or what had happened; but&#xD;
presently, spitting out a mouthful of earth, and putting his hair&#xD;
from his eyes, he stared at the heap which had been a buggy, and&#xD;
began to remember.&#xD;
"My-everlasting !" said the ghastly countryman, without stir-&#xD;
ring from his wagon, " I never thought o' seeing' you git up ag'in,&#xD;
I vow!"&#xD;
"I'm not hurt !" cried Hector, still a little wild. "Where is&#xD;
she ? "- meaning Charlotte.&#xD;
"tShe 's over the crick, by this time !  Lightning ! how she&#xD;
sprung !-- She jest grazed my wheels ! Lucky you smashed up&#xD;
jest as you did, or you'd a' tore me to finders. What a narrer&#xD;
'scape I had!"&#xD;
Hector hastened up the road to find Charlotte. The man sat&#xD;
a few minutes longer in the wagon, contemplating the catas-&#xD;
trophe and his own " narrer 'scape," when the unaccountable&#xD;
whim took him to get out.    He walked around the wreck;&#xD;
touched it with his foot; lifted a cushion with his shaking hand ;&#xD;
dropped it; drew' a long breath, and said, "My jingoes!" with a&#xD;
depth of expression which seemed to afford him great relief.&#xD;
Stunned by the fall, Charlotte lay for some seconds in the&#xD;
road; then got upon her feet and began to walk very fast up the&#xD;
hill, in pursuit of Hector's hat. Reflecting, suddenly, however,&#xD;
that she ought rther to look after the head it belonged to, she&#xD;
turned, and, nowf fully awake, ran, in great trepidation, to learn&#xD;
what had become of Hector. She met him coming up the road.&#xD;
"You are hurt ! " she cried out, at sight of him.&#xD;
" Not a bit !" Hector declared, stoutly. " I fell like a foot-&#xD;
ball,' and up again at a bound! "&#xD;
''But your face is covered with blood !~&#xD;
"Indeed ? I'ye been wiping- my mouth for something - I&#xD;

Charlotte stanched the blood with her handkerchief.&#xD;
"You 're a brave girl ! I feared you were hurt ! It is worth&#xD;
a kingdom to see you on your feet again ! There, that will do,&#xD;
- thank you ! "&#xD;
" Your lip is cut ! "&#xD;
" That 's nothing ! If you are safe, it 's all I care for. I teli&#xD;
you," said Hector, " after running such a rig, it 's rather exhila-&#xD;
rating to think there 's no damage done which money and a little&#xD;
salve won't repair!"&#xD;
"Where is your buggy ? "&#xD;
" It lies just below here, around those bushes. It looks like an&#xD;
Irishman's shanty run'hto by a locomotive."&#xD;
"And the horse ? "&#xD;
"Gone down the mountain ! Poor fellow ! I. hope he won't&#xD;
kill himself! But see, the people in that house are staring at&#xD;
us. How some people will stare, and keep at a safe distance,&#xD;
when others are in trouble ! These are priests and Levites, with&#xD;
a spice of curiosity added to their composition.  Let 's make&#xD;
Good Samaritans of them, against their will, and levy contribu-&#xD;
tions of brushes, water, and towels."&#xD;
Hector misjudged the people in question, and afterwards asked&#xD;
their forgiveness in his heart. They were poor women, very&#xD;
much frightened, but willing enough to do, when they knew what&#xD;
to do. Hector washed himself, combed his hair, and brushed&#xD;
his clothes, while one of them pinned up his sleeve, and prepared&#xD;
a plaster for his lip. Then, leaving Charlotte in their care, he&#xD;
returned to the wreck.&#xD;
"I swanny ! " said the countryman, rubbing his hands, "I&#xD;
never see anything chawed up like that 'ere buggy! IEoth exes,&#xD;
springs, fils, box, seat - everything smashed !  The, wheels, I&#xD;
guess, are sound, and that's all."&#xD;
" And our necks," suggested Hector.&#xD;
"Did n't I have a narrer 'scape ?  I can't help thinkin' on 't."&#xD;
And the man walked about the wreck.again, chuckling nervously,&#xD;
and looking very pale.&#xD;
" Is n't your name Crumlett ?"&#xD;
" That 's my name- ya-a-s ! " - Mr. Crumlett stared. -&#xD;
&#xD;
DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.                    91&#xD;
" Wal ! I did n't know ye before !  You begin to look like,&#xD;
washed up ! How d'e dew?    When d' ye come to town ?"&#xD;
Answering these questions briefly, Hector proposed to Mr.&#xD;
Crumlett to carry him home.&#xD;
" I declare," said that individual, regretfully, " I don't see&#xD;
how I can, any  way in the world'! I'am in a desprit hurry!"&#xD;
"0," replied Hector with a quiet smile, "you are i4 a hurry?&#xD;
But I should expect, of course, to pay you for your trouble."&#xD;
Mr.- Crumlett, on reflection: "Wal, I d' know -an old&#xD;
acquaintance, so - p'r'aps I might."&#xD;
Accordingly Mr. Crumlett took on board the buggy-cushions,&#xD;
with a few other fragments of the wreck ; assisted his " old&#xD;
acquaintance " to make a compact heap of the remainder on the&#xD;
road-side; and, finally, with Hector and Charlotte as passengers,&#xD;
turned his horses' heads down the mountain.&#xD;
Mr. Crumlett, as it proved, not only had time to carry them&#xD;
to their destination, but to drive tediously slow, at that. Gloat-&#xD;
ing over the accident, and chuckling repeatedly at his own&#xD;
'narrer 'scape," he seemed entirely to have forgotten that he&#xD;
was in a hurry. Occasionally, at Hector's instigation, he flour-&#xD;
ished his whip, and clucked a little to his horses; but those grave&#xD;
animals were not to be urged out of their comfortable pace by&#xD;
any such gentle means. Meanwhile, anxious to learn the fate&#xD;
of his own horse, Hector inquired for him on the way. He had&#xD;
been seen by several persons, who described him as going very&#xD;
fast, with the reins streaming from his back, and " one tug whip-&#xD;
ping his side to make him go faster." But presently there came&#xD;
a pedler, who had passed by Mr. Dunbury's house.&#xD;
"aI have n't seen any horse running," said the itinerant trades-&#xD;
man ; " but I saw a woman unharnessing, a horse, in a yard, back&#xD;
here."&#xD;
Hector's spirits rose. The woman was Bridget, and the horse&#xD;
was the runaway.&#xD;
"Blessed pedler," said he in his heart, "go thy way, and bo&#xD;
happy.-- Drive on, friend Crumlett!"&#xD;
Mr. Crumlett cracked his whip and .clucked again, but to&#xD;
little purpose. In the course of time, however, the party came&#xD;

92                DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.&#xD;
in sight of Mr. Dunbury's house. Bridget stood in the road,&#xD;
her broad, red face turned with an expression of wonder towards&#xD;
Mr. Crumlett's establishment. Hector swung his hat.&#xD;
"It 's him !" screamed Bridget, dancing and clapping rher&#xD;
hands, - "Mrs. Dunbury ! it 's him, with a good head yit to wear&#xD;
a hat on!"&#xD;
Then straightway out ran Mrs. Dunbury, her face white and.&#xD;
wild, hair dishevelled, cape falling from her shouiars, and threw&#xD;
herself upon Hector's neck, as he jumped from the wagon. A&#xD;
few stifled words, a few choking sobs and tears, and, her excited&#xD;
strength relaxing, she sank fainting in his arms.&#xD;
With Charlotte's ready assistance Hector bore her into the&#xD;
house. Presently her eyes opened languidly, and her grateful&#xD;
look wandered from Hector to his companion.&#xD;
Danger, like death, is a leveller. It brings king and beggar&#xD;
upon the same human ground. From the moment of peril, when&#xD;
Hector felt Charlotte's womanly clasp upon his arm, they had&#xD;
ceased to be strangers; and, still glowing with the generous heat&#xD;
with which her sympathy inspired him, he introduced her to his&#xD;
mother. The latter extended her feeble hand, with. a smile of&#xD;
welcome. A tender chord was touched in Charlotte's breast, and&#xD;
she knelt humble and happy at the invalid's feet.&#xD;
"God bless you, my child ! " said-Mrs. Dunbury, fervently.&#xD;
Hector inquired for his father.&#xD;
"I I blowed the har fur 'im," cried Bridget,." but he did n't&#xD;
coom yet ! It 's over the creek I '11 go an' cahl 'imr ! "&#xD;
She ran out, and met Mr. Dunbury in the yard, who presently&#xD;
entered, with Corny at his heels. He was an excitable and&#xD;
impetuous man, and the girl had told him just enough of the&#xD;
catastrophe, to make him fume. Hector hastened to explain.&#xD;
"I might' told ye how 't would be! " said Corny, notching a&#xD;
stick with his knife.-&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury, gruffly: "What do you mean ? "&#xD;
Corny, drawling his words: " Wal, the spring was loose that&#xD;
held the tug in --and I know'd 't would be all the time unhookin'&#xD;
if ye did n't look out."&#xD;
&#xD;

DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury: "Did you know no better than to leave such a&#xD;
trap for breaking people's necks?"&#xD;
Corny, phlegmatic: "'T wan't my trap ! You told me to&#xD;
harness Jerry to the buggy."&#xD;
Hector : " Why did n't you tell me the spring was loose ? "&#xD;
Corny: "'Cause I did n't think on 't, I s'pose."&#xD;
Bridget: "That 's jist one o' Carny's tricks! He'd know&#xD;
nothin' at ahl, if 't wan't knocked out of 'im." -Punching him&#xD;
with the broom. " Out o' the house wid yer whittlin's, noo ! "&#xD;
Corny, pugnaciously : " Come, stop !"&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury: " What are you here for? Why4don't you go&#xD;
and take care of that horse ?"&#xD;
Corny : " You did n't tell me to!"&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury, recognizing Charlotte, uttered a sort of half apol-&#xD;
ogy, and welcomed her with high good-breeding. But a con-&#xD;
sciousness of being somewhat carelessly dressed appeared to&#xD;
trouble him just at this time, and, the moment her attention was&#xD;
withdrawn, he took occasion to pull up his limp dickey, and&#xD;
smooth down his rumpled shirt under the worn lapels of his faded&#xD;
plush waistcoat.&#xD;
"Where are you going?" asked the invalid, clinging to Hec&#xD;
tor's hand.&#xD;
"I am reminded that I have left our 'friend Crumlett w iung,&#xD;
-and he is in a terrific hurry!"&#xD;
-. " But you must not let him go till after dinner. How kind it&#xD;
was in him to bring you down! "&#xD;
Hector found Mr. Crumlett sitting patiently in his wagon,&#xD;
whipping the gate-post.&#xD;
"How much do I owe you for your trouble, sir ? "&#xD;
" Wal, I d'n' know,-guess fifty cents '11 be 'bout right,-&#xD;
won't it, hey?"&#xD;
Hector paid him, and asked if he would stop to dinner.&#xD;
"Wal,-it 's unexpected, naow," replied Mr. Crumlett, pocket-&#xD;
ing the change, -"like enough I will! You can give my team a&#xD;
bite, I s'pose ?"&#xD;
"Put your horses in the barn, and cut as much grass for them&#xD;
as you choose," said Hector. "There 's the barn; there 's the&#xD;

"Wal, I don't mind waitin'--only git the team a chawin' on to&#xD;
suthin'! Guess I'll back 'em round a little, and feed 'em here in&#xD;
the shade, -may as well."&#xD;
Mr. Crumlett accordingly staid to dinner; ate prodigiously;&#xD;
told all about the way that buggy went to pieces; recurred some&#xD;
twenty times to his own "narrer 'scape ;" and, on- going away,&#xD;
asked permission to throw that "little han'ful o' grass" into his&#xD;
wagon, -having cut considerably more than his team had had&#xD;
time to eat. The permission granted, he set out, well satisfied&#xD;
with his fortunes generally, and his dinner in particular, and drove&#xD;
leisurely up the mountain, rehearsing to himself a new and more&#xD;
startling version of his adventures, designed to astonish his friends&#xD;
at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ix.&#xD;
HECTOR AND CHARLOTTE.&#xD;
TuE light of a new morning has.dawned upon Charlotte's life,&#xD;
The past lies behind her like a night of troubled dreams. A few&#xD;
clouds of doubt and fear still chase each other across her sky ; but&#xD;
the thick darkness is gone, and the young day is fresh and calm,&#xD;
and full of promise.&#xD;
Not only has the catastrophe of the buggy served to throw&#xD;
open at once a wide door of sympathy between her and her, new&#xD;
friends, but it furnishes a fruitful and exhilarating theme for famil-&#xD;
iar discussion. Hector makes epigrams upon a certain 'leaden-&#xD;
hued contusion under Charlotte's eye; upon his own lameness, and&#xD;
the cut in his lip ; and upon other pleasing results of the disaster.&#xD;
Then, to enliven a dull company of evening visitors, who have&#xD;
called in honor of his return to Huntersford, he announces that he&#xD;
will deliver an entertaining and instructive lecture on the subject,&#xD;
accompanied with music by his mother, and illustrated by original&#xD;
pen-and-ink sketches. The lecture proves a capital burlesque, and&#xD;
elicits tremendous applause. The eloquence of the speaker is&#xD;
equalled only by the originality of the diagrams. The first of&#xD;
these represents "Corny whittling;" received with roars of&#xD;
laughter. Next, "Corny brings Jerry to the door." Then, vari- .&#xD;
ous stages of the catastrophe are portrayed, until "Mr. Crumlett "&#xD;
is introduced to the audience. At this point, Mr. Danbury, who&#xD;
has preserved his gravity all along, forgets his dignity, and shakes&#xD;
with democratic fun. Mrs. Dunbury joins in the general merri-&#xD;
ment, -more quietly than any of the rest; but her pride in&#xD;
Hector makes her very happy. Charlotte's soft eyes glisten; and&#xD;

Phobe Jackwood, throwing herself upon her friend's shoulder in&#xD;
a paroxysm of mirth, declares that she "shall die ! "&#xD;
Hector limps three weeks with his bruises; and Charlotte car-&#xD;
ries the dark-colored mark under her eye for nearly the same&#xD;
length of time. They condole with each other, and laugh at each&#xD;
other, until one would judge them to be friends of years' standing.&#xD;
The invalid's health gradually improves. Hector is a good&#xD;
physician, Charlotte a capital companion and nurse. But, not-&#xD;
withstanding all their care, Mrs. Dunbury's mind frequently&#xD;
relapses into despondency, and she believes death inevitable,&#xD;
unless the discarded doctor is recalled.&#xD;
It is scarcely possible for her to abandon the stimulus of-drugs.&#xD;
She would be true to her promise, and abide by IHector's treat-&#xD;
ment; but daily, by mere infirmity of will, she finds herself trans-&#xD;
gressing his commandments. She carries magnesia in her pocket,&#xD;
and eats it by stealth. She chews rhubarb-root, and calls it sweet-&#xD;
flag. She swallows pills in her apple-sauce. She entertains salts&#xD;
and a teaspoon in a drawer, concealed beneath numerous strata of&#xD;
folded apparel, and indulges in furtive doses of the same, ever and&#xD;
anon.&#xD;
Hector perceived something of this, and, going to his mother,&#xD;
by the very force of his simple and earnest dealing, compelled a&#xD;
confession. One by one she abandoned all her hidden drugs to his&#xD;
mercy, reserving only a modest lump of rhubarb, and a couple of&#xD;
favorite pills.&#xD;
"But what can I do?" she cried.&#xD;
" When you think medicine absolutely required, call on me."&#xD;
That morning she ate the last of the rhubarb; the next, she&#xD;
swallowed one of the pills, and in the afternoon sent the other to&#xD;
keep that company ; and, on the third day, in great extremity,&#xD;
she had recourse to Hector.&#xD;
Hector cruelly ordered a, pitcher of warm water; and, from&#xD;
that time, emetics of that simple nature were the sole consolation&#xD;
he would afford her, when she hungered and thirsted after drugs.&#xD;
But nothing could be more effective than this treatment; she&#xD;
recovered her appetite, and soon her greatest anxiety was to have&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR AND CHARLOTTE.                   97&#xD;
something delicate and nice for dinner. This, indeed, became, for&#xD;
a time, the chief care and study of her life.&#xD;
"Fie, mother !" cried Hector, one fine morning, at the break.&#xD;
fast-table, -"these trifles are unworthy of us. We are too much&#xD;
like a celebrated old woman -&#xD;
'Victuals and drink were her chief diet,&#xD;
And yet the old woman could never be quiet.'&#xD;
For my part, I believe we should live upon something besides&#xD;
victuals and drink, notwithstanding so venerable an example."&#xD;
" Hunger," said Mr. Dunbury, "knows no philosophy."&#xD;
" Nor is genuine hunger troubled about many things. It re-&#xD;
ceives its daily bread, and is thankful. In this artificial life, we&#xD;
have no conception what simple and humble fare is all-sufficient to&#xD;
the natural man. What if I should tell you I know a family that&#xD;
eats worms?"&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury, with a beseeching look : " Don't, I pray - at&#xD;
the breakfast-table, Hector !"&#xD;
Corny, grinning over his muffin: " A family 't eats worms ! "&#xD;
Charlotte :  I think I know the same family."&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury: "Not in this region-not among civilized&#xD;
people!"&#xD;
Hector, gravely : " Our nearest neighbors, mother. In faith, it&#xD;
is a family of young robins in the tree before my window. You&#xD;
should see them once! It really looks quite human - the beau-&#xD;
tiful care the old ones take of their young. The best of us might&#xD;
learn a lesson of them. The love, and joy, and gratitude, they&#xD;
manifest, seem to say, much more plainly than our hollow words,&#xD;
especially when our faithless lives belie them,=- ' Give us each&#xD;
day our daily bread.' "&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury: "Do you ever hear of young birds repaying&#xD;
the care of their parents, by feeding them, in return, when they&#xD;
become too old and infirm to feed themselves"&#xD;
"That 's a simple duty, mother, which I think no well-bred and&#xD;
affectionate robins would shrink from performing."&#xD;
"Will you be so good, then, as to imagine some pretty example&#xD;
of the kind, and, drawing your lesson from it, go down the meadow,&#xD;

98    SECTORR AND CHARLOTTE.&#xD;
this morning, and catch the famous pickerel your father saw in&#xD;
the river, yesterday?  I would like fish for dinner."&#xD;
" I don't know, mother.  The last time I went a-fishing, I&#xD;
hooked a cruel hook through the backs of little fish, and let them&#xD;
swim around in the water, in untold anguish, to bait their big&#xD;
brothers who came to eat them. In the excitement of the sport,&#xD;
- I believe men call it sport, - I had not one merciful thought&#xD;
to bestow upon the innocent little folk that had been so unfortu-&#xD;
nate as to be caught out of their native brook in my basket."&#xD;
Corny, stoically: "I don't mind it 's hurtin' 'em. I like to&#xD;
see 'em wiggle!"     .&#xD;
Hector : " That 's all very nice, without doubt ; but how do&#xD;
you suppose you and I would feel with great iron hooks through&#xD;
our backs, -let down into a city of hungry lawyers, for in-&#xD;
stance, -- with some big giant swinging us from the end of a&#xD;
long pole?"&#xD;
Corny, incredulously : " They c-a-n-'t ! "&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury: "You can catch the pickerel with a snare.&#xD;
That will be no greater cruelty than that practised upon the&#xD;
worms by the worthy family you speak of, and which you thought&#xD;
so pretty and commendable."&#xD;
Hector : "I've no answer to make.  I'm going out to show&#xD;
the men how to mow, this forenoon ; and, if I think of it, I, will&#xD;
catch your pickerel."&#xD;
At nine o'clock, Mrs. Dunbury looked out of her window, and&#xD;
saw the mowers in the meadow, with Hector at their head, cutting&#xD;
into the tall grass with uniform, strokes, and laying the swaths in&#xD;
even lines behind them.&#xD;
" He has quite forgotten the pickerel," she said to Charlotte.&#xD;
"If you should go to the meadow, and carry him his fishing-pole,&#xD;
I am sure he would ask no better excuse to throw down that&#xD;
dreadful scythe."&#xD;
Charlotte set out with a light heart to do the errand, -imag-&#xD;
ining herself a native-born country-girl, rustic, happy, and free&#xD;
from care, and singing snatches of merry songs as she went. .&#xD;
She crossed the rotting timbers of the bridge, and approached&#xD;
the mowers under cover of the willows that grew around a bend&#xD;

in the stream. Birds fluttered and chattered in the bushes ; the&#xD;
waters rippled and gleamed, and leaped, with low, gurgling laugh-&#xD;
ter, over their pebbly bed; and the summer wind swept gently across&#xD;
the grass, playing among the leaves, and blowing with grateful&#xD;
coolness on her brow and in her hair. 0, she was made for such&#xD;
happiness; she felt that the good God loved her then, and that&#xD;
birds, and stream, and breeze, and even the soft haze that brooded&#xD;
over the valley, and lay in translucent purple banks all around&#xD;
upon the mountain heights, sympathized in the pure joy that over-&#xD;
flowed her heart.&#xD;
Charlotte trod quickly along the shaven turf, until she could see&#xD;
the mowers carrying back their scythes along the level swaths.&#xD;
Hector marched at their head, singing a negro melody. Corny&#xD;
brought up thq rear, whittling his snath with a jacknife. Mr.&#xD;
Dunbury and two day-laborers formed the body of the force. Not&#xD;
far off was Bridget, shaking out the new-mown grass with a fork,&#xD;
tossing it wildly about her ears, or flinging it in great wads, here&#xD;
and there, over the meadow.&#xD;
Arrived at the edge of the field, the men rested their scythes&#xD;
upon the ground, and began to whet them, having first wiped&#xD;
them with wisps of grass.  The cheerful ring of the'stone upon&#xD;
the metal beat a measured accompaniment to Hector's singing,-&#xD;
only Corny striking occasionally a little out of time. Charlotte&#xD;
paused involuntarily. What trouble came up out of the past, at&#xD;
that happy hour, to tyrannize over her spirit? She stood hesi-&#xD;
tating in the meadow, when Hector ceased singing, and called out&#xD;
to her with a cheery welcome, as he threw down his scythe.&#xD;
Le'me go'n ketch the pickiril, if you do' wander," drawled&#xD;
Corny.&#xD;
Hector: "Would you quite as lief do that as mow7"&#xD;
Corny, earnestly: "I druthers "&#xD;
"I have no doubt of it ; how refreshing it is to hear yu speak&#xD;
the truth!"&#xD;
And Lector coolly walked off with the fishing-pole, leaving the&#xD;
chagrined Corny to stare at him, with perplexed and disappointed&#xD;
looks, over his scythe.&#xD;
"You shall go with rne, Charlotte." Hector stepped to the&#xD;

young girl's side, as she was returning towards the stream. " The&#xD;
fields are so sweet and beautiful to-day, how can you shut your-&#xD;
self up in the house ?"&#xD;
The glance of his eye and the gentle tones of his voice stirred&#xD;
a strange and happy emotion in her heart ; and she had no power&#xD;
to resist the influen, e that drew her to his side.&#xD;
"Your pickerel," said Hector, "is the very attorney of fishes.&#xD;
He locates his office in some eligible spot, often among the brown&#xD;
river-grass, at the, mouth of some little brook ; and I have no&#xD;
doubt but, if we understood the fishes' language, or rather their&#xD;
signs we should be able to read over his door, 'PiKE PICKEREL,&#xD;
ATTORNEY AND COUNSELLOR AT LAW.' There, day after day, he&#xD;
awaits his clients, who, never suspecting what a scaly fellow he is,&#xD;
run into the very jaws of danger, and are taken in by him, before&#xD;
they know it.  Some of the little brook-people are too cunning&#xD;
and quick even for his sharp practice, and escape in spite of his&#xD;
teeth; but generally, when he darts into a school, he seizes at&#xD;
least one out of it, and,. to make a long tail short, finishes him at&#xD;
a bite. Those that run away may be called flying-fishes, while&#xD;
those that are taken become swallows. And so our lawyer flour-&#xD;
ishes, until his line of business is interrupted by a line of a- if-&#xD;
ferent nature, and some avenging power, by hook or by crook,&#xD;
puts a stop to, his proceedings with an attachment, -such as I&#xD;
am about to try, in the case of our neighbor under the bushes,&#xD;
here."&#xD;
Hector entertained his companion with this sage dissertation&#xD;
upon the character and habits of the pickerel, as they walked&#xD;
along by the willows and crossed the bridge together. On the&#xD;
other bank of the creek, they followed the old' wagon track up&#xD;
stream, until they arrived at the confluence of a brook that came&#xD;
down from the eastern hills.  Here, in a quiet nook, overhung&#xD;
with bushes. the attorney of fishes was found. Hector's eyes&#xD;
sparkled, as he arranged the fatal snare.&#xD;
"A royal pickerel, upon my word ! Not so large as a shark,&#xD;
but he '11 do. Look, Charlotte, how neatly and comfortably I&#xD;
"hpLthee!"oslaughed Charlotte, as the fish deliberately took his&#xD;
&#xD;
r  ii&#xD;
&#xD;
RECTOR AND CHARLOTTE.                 101&#xD;
nose out of the wire loop, and with one stroke of his tail propelled&#xD;
himself into a knot of grass.&#xD;
"The snare is a vulgar and inartistic contrivance !" exclaimed&#xD;
Hector. "But I am bound to see fins out of water, at some rate !&#xD;
He 's a little shy, a little conservative,-- quite a prosperous and&#xD;
cautious fish ; but*-there 's his nose, and there swings the wire&#xD;
under it."&#xD;
At this crisis, Charlotte could not help reminding him of what&#xD;
he had preached, that morning, to Corny.&#xD;
"How would you like it yourself, if some superior power should&#xD;
make a man-snare of the north-pole and the equinoctial line -"&#xD;
"Don't speak of such disagreeable things just at this time !"&#xD;
interrupted Hector.  "In three seconds you may laugh, then we&#xD;
will talk about cruelty to fishes; but now; - -look out for your&#xD;
head!"&#xD;
A sudden pull,  snap went the pole, - and away darted the&#xD;
pickerel up stream, with the wire jerked tightly under his gills,&#xD;
and the line streaming after him through the water. He was out&#xD;
of sight in an instant; but the tip of the spruce pole to which the&#xD;
line was 'attached, swimming on the surface, served as a buoy to&#xD;
mark his course.&#xD;
"So much for a short line and a brittle pole!" exclaimed&#xD;
Hector.&#xD;
"Your mother thought that line might not answer, and gave&#xD;
me another,   I had quite forgotten it," said Charlotte. " Here&#xD;
it is."&#xD;
"But my snare is gone."&#xD;
"I can give you a wire out-of my bonnet."&#xD;
The new snare was scarcely rigged, when the pickerel, having&#xD;
got clear of his encumbrance, reappeared in his favorite haunt,&#xD;
looking very impudent, as if he had returned in a spirit of litig&#xD;
tion, to learn what it was all about.  Hector, accordingly, pro-&#xD;
ceeded to demonstrate the matter, by adroitly slipping a second&#xD;
noose over his gills.&#xD;
"Whatan expression of countenance! It says plain as talk-&#xD;
ig, 'Do that again, and I '11 prosecute !' And, I presume, if&#xD;
~  he ouldspeak, or if we understood the Finnish dialect, which&#xD;

of law to us."'&#xD;
Another pull, - and his pickerelship, leaping with a sudden&#xD;
splash out of the water, slipped from the snare and fell flouncing&#xD;
in Charlotte's lap, as she was sitting on the grass. She flung him&#xD;
off, with a scream; and the next moment he was threshing the&#xD;
shallow water in a small stone basin below, when Hector seized&#xD;
him, and cast him upon dry land.&#xD;
"Have ye cotcht him? have ye cotcht him?" cried the&#xD;
excited Bridget, rushing into the bushes on the opposite bank.&#xD;
Kape 'im ! hould 'im ! and I'll be afther wading. acrost to&#xD;
yez ! "&#xD;
Nobody observed her until, taking her shoes under her arm,&#xD;
and carefully holding her dress, she stepped down into the water&#xD;
and commenced fording.&#xD;
"Go back, you ridiculous creature !" cried Hector. "What&#xD;
are you going to do ?  What do you want ?"A&#xD;
"It 's the big floppin' fish I 'd be havin' ! " said Bridget. "An'&#xD;
it 's br'il 'im for dinner I will."&#xD;
" Come around by the bridge, then, and be respectable," said&#xD;
Hector. "You're a fright, Bridget !  You .look like a Gothic&#xD;
cottage !"&#xD;
" An' where 's the harm, sure ? Nobody tould ye to be lookin'.&#xD;
Ye might be kapin' yer eyes to home, jist ! "&#xD;
"But you '11 be drowned, Bridget! You are not amphibious ;&#xD;
you 're not a duck, dear ; I can take my oath you 're not web-&#xD;
footed!"&#xD;
At that moment Corny's grinning red face made its appearance&#xD;
among the willows behind her.&#xD;
"Go it," he cried; "'t an't deep !"&#xD;
4 ;Dape ? " echoed Bridget.  " No more it is n't.! I 've waded&#xD;
this creek a dozen o' times, an' niver a bit did I get drownded,&#xD;
yit ! "&#xD;
" But you never waded in this spot," said Hector. "There's a&#xD;
deep place right before you.",&#xD;
Bridget, doubtingly : "Miss Charlit, is it the truth he 's tellin',&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR AND CHARLOTTE.                 103&#xD;
Charlotte : "Can't you see?"&#xD;
Bridget: "Faith, an' how should I be seem', wid the sun in&#xD;
the wather dazzlin' the eyes of me out o' me head inthirely ?"&#xD;
Corny, vociferously : " Water-snakes, Bridget !"&#xD;
" Och, be jabbers, where ?"&#xD;
" Right behind ye, here, streakin' it arter ye like blazes !"&#xD;
Bridget, in a fluster : "It 's lyin' ye are, noo !"&#xD;
Corny : "I hope to die ! There 's one big enough to swaller&#xD;
ye! He 's got teeth like a pitchfork!"&#xD;
Bridget, dropping skirts and shoes : "S'int Pathrick, hilp ! Is&#xD;
there a snake, Misther Hector ?"&#xD;
Corny, throwing a slab of flood-wood into the creek : "There&#xD;
he is ! he '11 have ye by the heels in no time !    Scooter,&#xD;
Bridget ! "&#xD;
The panic-stricken Bridget plunged forwafd,- and downward,&#xD;
- and under.   For a moment nothing of her was visible but a&#xD;
whirlpool of skirts and a floating sun-bonnet ; then up rose her&#xD;
face like a sea-nymph's, covered with weeds and hair, and drip-&#xD;
ping profusely.&#xD;
Corny, yelling and clapping his hands: "Swim!    Put in !&#xD;
He's arter ye!&#xD;
Bridget: " 0, bloody murther !"-blowing water out of her&#xD;
mouth, and struggling for sight and breath. " It's drownded I'll&#xD;
be ! I 'se kilt intirely ! "&#xD;
Hector, extending his fish-pole : " Catch this!"&#xD;
She grasped it eagerly, and Hector drew her to the bank. After&#xD;
a dealof struggling and stumbling, she got up, with the heavy&#xD;
water pouring from her clothes, and looked around.&#xD;
" Faix," said she, "who is it that 's kilt ?  Quit yer laughin',&#xD;
wid ye, ye botherin', lyin' spalpeen of a Carny !  There 's niver&#xD;
such a baste as a wather-snake anywheres in the crick; and&#xD;

Hector: "And making believe dive, too, Bridget !"&#xD;
Bridget, indignantly : " An' is 't that knocks such sights n' fun&#xD;

"Btyou have lost your shoes !"&#xD;

Hector : "I '11 get it for you."&#xD;
Charlotte, with tears in her eyes: "Don't wait for it,.Bridget !&#xD;

Bridget : " I'd be exercisin' that Carny, if I had hold of 'im&#xD;

Hector, raising a drenched rag on the end of his fishing-pole :&#xD;

beautifully. Wrap 'im up in it, Misther Hector."&#xD;
Corny, from over the creek : " Here! that 's my jacket ! "&#xD;
Having rolled the fish in the garment, -which was one of&#xD;
several, belonging to Corny, left lying in the fields that summer, -&#xD;
Bridget set out for the house, muttering to herself, and shaking&#xD;
her head defiantly, her wet clothes clinging and flapping, and her&#xD;
drenched, uncombed hair streaming down her back. Meanwhile&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury was calling, impatiently, to Corny. Hector asked&#xD;
the latter if he heard.&#xD;
" Wal, I s'pose I do," said that indifferent youth, seating him-&#xD;
self under the willows.&#xD;
" Why don't you answer, then ? "&#xD;
'Cos'; I s'pose I did n't think on 't. I was lookin' at her."&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury called again at the top of his lungs.&#xD;
" W-a-a-a-l! " bellowed Corny, "I I'm comn' !" and, taking&#xD;
out his knife, he began to whittle a dry stick.&#xD;

Hector, severely: "Is that what you mean by coming ?"&#xD;
Corny : "What 's the thundering' hurry, I 'd like to know ?&#xD;
Time enough ! Say, why don't ye go up to Jackwood's bridge,&#xD;
an' ketch some o' them suckers ? I see a hull slew o' lunkin' big&#xD;
fellers, up there, t' other day."&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury was calling again ; and, with extreme reluctance,&#xD;
young Master Boughton got up from the bushes, put his knife out&#xD;
of sight, and returned, lazily, to his work.&#xD;
"Come, Charlotte," said Hector, " let us get away from the&#xD;
hearing of this. It makes my soul sick. - Let us stroll up the&#xD;
creek, and see about Corny's suckers. Will you come ? "&#xD;
The fields lay fragrant and fair before her ; and to go out there,&#xD;
alone with him,into the beauty and calm of the valley, seemed an&#xD;
almost intoxicating happiness. Charlotte hesitated ; but he said&#xD;
" Come !" again, so winningly and. kindly, that she could not&#xD;
refuse.&#xD;
"You must be responsible to your mother for taking me away."&#xD;
"Yes, yes," returned Hector, with a strange fervor in his&#xD;
tones, " I'll be responsible, I '11 be anything for the sake of&#xD;
your company.&#xD;
"Mycompany ? " repeated Charlotte, doubtingly.&#xD;
Hector turned upon her a look so radiant and tender that it&#xD;
thrilled her through and through.&#xD;
"Aside from my mother,,' said he, "you are the only person I&#xD;
see in whose society I take 4ny satisfaction ; and you know it."&#xD;
"I know," - Charlotte's heart fluttered, --" I know that you&#xD;
are often dissatisfied and lo ely. Your mother has observed it,&#xD;
and it troubles her."&#xD;
" 0, my mother does not understand me ! And you do not,&#xD;
Charlotte."&#xD;
" I know I do not : that is not for me."&#xD;
"Not for you, Charlotte ? "&#xD;
"No, - I feel so like a little child beside you, always ! I am&#xD;
glad when you are happy ; I am sorry when you are sad; and&#xD;
that is all : I never think of understanding you."&#xD;
"'My heart craves to be understood, Charlotte ; and you might&#xD;
understand it, if you would !"&#xD;

" I?" cried Charlotte, startled.&#xD;
"You, better than any one. I could throw open all doors to&#xD;
you, but you will not even look into the.inner chambers."&#xD;
" It is because I have no right ! "&#xD;
Charlotte's voice was low and tremulous. Hector looked at her&#xD;
inquiringly, then, walking near her side, took her hand ; but she&#xD;
withdrew it gently.&#xD;
"Who and what are you?" he cried out, impulsively.&#xD;
" A child -to you.n"&#xD;
" But children do not do so: children do not keep us at arm's&#xD;
length : children are trusting and simple."&#xD;
" I cease to be a child when you would make me more than&#xD;
that to you."&#xD;
"And why not more?"&#xD;
"I am not worthy."&#xD;
" Not worthy ! " Hector seized her hand again, and held it&#xD;
clasped in his, in spite of her. " Not worthy ! 0, Charlotte, do&#xD;
I not know your heart ?"&#xD;
" But you do not know my past ! "&#xD;
" That has been dark, Ilknow. Although you have never told&#xD;
me of it, I see something of what you have suffered. But think&#xD;
of my past, Charlotte !. 'T is I who am not worthy ! 0, the&#xD;
rank weeds of passion I have trampled through ! They lie rotting&#xD;
behind me now, .and memory is the wind that brings their&#xD;
pestilent exhalations to my nostrils. It is this which makes me&#xD;
sick of life."&#xD;
"It is that which is purifying your life : I have seen so much."&#xD;
"Perhaps,' for remorse is very busy, ploughing over those&#xD;
weeds."&#xD;
" And perhaps the soil of your nature will be all the richer for&#xD;
them," added Charlotte, timidly.&#xD;
" If they are ever subdued," said Hector. "You have spoken&#xD;
wise words, and they comfort me - a little. I try to believe that&#xD;
my experience has been necessary and useful; but since I have&#xD;
known you, I have seen myself so soiled and stained, that I have&#xD;
thought there was not rain enough in the. sweet heavens to wash&#xD;
me clean,"&#xD;
&#xD;
106&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR AND CHARLOTTE.                107&#xD;
" If you had not aspirations above other men, you would not be&#xD;
dissatisfied with yourself," replied Charlotte.&#xD;
" Your mantle of charity is broad, and very grateful to the back&#xD;
of my offences ! But why do I talk to you in this way ? to you,&#xD;
who, above all, I am anxious should think well of me ! Is it not&#xD;
because I want you to know me, - my weakness as well as my&#xD;
strength, my dark side no less than my bright side, - in order&#xD;
that I may have your sympathy ?"&#xD;
" Remember-reflect," said Charlotte, troubled, - " I am but&#xD;
your servant."&#xD;
"Servant! I hate the word! It sounds too much like slave !&#xD;
There is no servitude to the soul but ignorance and passion; and&#xD;
the soul in you is all I have to deal with. Had I found you in&#xD;
the meanest capacity, in absolute bondage even, it would have&#xD;
made no shade of difference; still something in your soul would&#xD;
have spoken to something in mine, -would have called me&#xD;
brother, and I would have recognized my sister !"&#xD;
Hector spoke with a vehemence that appeared to. alarm his&#xD;
companion. Her cheek paled, and her hand quivered with agita-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"So let me have no more of that ! " he went on, smiling gently.&#xD;
" We will put our feet upon the false partition between us. You&#xD;
understand me, -I have no thought of falling in love with you;&#xD;
that is as far from my heart as Jupiter from the sun."&#xD;
Charlotte laughed a sad and tearful laugh, and said there was&#xD;
no need of telling her that.&#xD;
"'Of course not ; you are a girl of sense. It is because I can&#xD;
put this confidence in you, and know that you will not misinter-&#xD;
pret me, that I esteem you-that I choose you for a friend."&#xD;
"But you have so many old friends here, - friends so much&#xD;
worthier than I!"&#xD;
"I have not one such, Charlotte. I cherish but a shrivelled&#xD;
respect for the best of them, - that you know."&#xD;
" And I know that they complain of you for that. They were&#xD;
once your intimates; but now you are indifferent to them. And&#xD;
it is you who have changed, they say, -they never change."&#xD;
" True : I have changed, I do change, I hope always to change.&#xD;

108&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR AND CHARLOTTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
And it is because they never change, that the grass has grown&#xD;
between our paths. There is Charles Hart, for instance: he was&#xD;
the companion of my boyhood; there was sympathy and .con-&#xD;
fidence between us ; and, in all my journeyings, I never forgot&#xD;
him. On coming home, I anticipated scarce a greater pleasure&#xD;
than that of meeting him. We would measure experiences, com-&#xD;
pare philosophies, and learn so much of each other, I thought.&#xD;
Well, I saw him. He was a withered bough ; he bore no fruit&#xD;
for me. His talk was of oxen. He delighted in reminiscences&#xD;
of good horse-trades. He told all about Jim Weston's fat hogs.&#xD;
Great stories he recounted of riding fractious colts, of breaking&#xD;
stubborn steers, of running tilt against pugnacious rams. Con-&#xD;
versation agreeable enough in its way, but unsatisfactory on the&#xD;
whole. In principles and truths that were the life of my spirit,&#xD;
he confessed a total lack of interest. I spoke of my poetical&#xD;
studies -he had had things of greater importance to attend&#xD;
to. I advanced ideas on spiritual culture -he thought them&#xD;
dangerous : he had done up his faith in the shroud of his creed,&#xD;
folded his arms, and was waiting for a resurrection. When I&#xD;
wished to lead his mind towards the miracles of life and growth,&#xD;
he branched out on the subject of onions, and told what beds of&#xD;
'em 'me andfather' raised, last year. He is but a sample of the&#xD;
rest. I am not sorry that they find me changed."&#xD;
" But the young ladies," said Charlotte; " they are not like the&#xD;
men."&#xD;
"I hold not a very plump opinion of -them, either. Some of&#xD;
them are pretty and intelligent, I allow. I find real piety and&#xD;
goodness in a few. But see how they have been educated ! I&#xD;
do not complain of what they have not learned, so much as of&#xD;
what they have learned amiss. Conventionality and expediency&#xD;
are their two hands. The principal use of their ears seems to be&#xD;
to catch the answer to the important question ' What will the&#xD;
world say ?' But the worst of all is, they have been taught by&#xD;
their wise mothers to subordinate all their motives and aspirations&#xD;
to a low matrimonial ambition. This is, in fact, the nose they&#xD;
follow, - with one eye on convenience, the other on respectability.&#xD;
They are so sharp in this practice, that it is dangerous for an&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR AND CHARLOTTE.                 109&#xD;
unmarried man to approach then. I have known brave excep-&#xD;
tions, but the rule applies pretty generally. What wonder, then,&#xD;
that I neglect them for you ?  It is refreshing to find one sensible&#xD;
girl, who has no thought of being fallen in love with ! "&#xD;
" That would be insane in me, indeed ! " said Charlotte, smiling,&#xD;
but with a strange emotion in her face.&#xD;
".And yet," cried Hector, "the idea is not so absurd as you&#xD;
imagine ! But do not fear ! My days of fancy are passed.&#xD;
Had I seen you no longer ago than when I was in the south,&#xD;
there might have been danger ; but there is none now."&#xD;
Charlotte drew a long breath. Her countenance was downcast&#xD;
and troubled.&#xD;
"That offends you, I see ! It should not. Come, look up, -&#xD;
smile."&#xD;
Charlotte raised her eyes. They were filled with tears.&#xD;
"How have I grieved you?"&#xD;
" You have not - it was nothing you said -"&#xD;
"And yet," insisted Hector, "I touched some chord that suffer-&#xD;
ing has made sensitive. -How you distrust me ! "&#xD;
"II do not distrust you," saidCharlotte.&#xD;
" If you did not, you would tell me of your sufferings. You&#xD;
would lift that dark curtain which hides your heart."&#xD;
They had stopped; they were standing by a little runnel in the&#xD;
meadow. Hector held her wrist and looked down earnestly in her&#xD;
face. For a moment she struggled with herself; then spoke out,&#xD;
hurriedly.&#xD;
" Hector, you have been true to me, and I cannot deceive you.&#xD;
Let me tell you this, then, once for all. If you knew myhistory,&#xD;
you would put me from you. It is the consciousness of this that&#xD;
shoots me through with pain, when I remember myself- you-oa&#xD;
and the gulf between us !&#xD;
Hector became pale with apprehension.&#xD;
"Show me that gulf," he said, with an incredulous smile.&#xD;
"YNo,-no,-- I have warned you of the truth, --the fact I&#xD;
can never speak."&#xD;
.Hector's brow was overcast ; but, seeing how strangely sad and&#xD;
fair she looked, with her large eyes drooping under his searching&#xD;

gaze, he placed his finger, playfully, under her chin, and met her&#xD;
upward glance with a generous smile.&#xD;
"Pardon me," he said, in a low, musical tone. "  '11 try not&#xD;
to ask again for what does not belong to me. Forget it all; and&#xD;
we will see now what can be done for Corny's suckers, --for here&#xD;
we are, close by the bridge, and the squirrels on the fence are&#xD;
chattering at us."&#xD;
But Hector's heart was no longer in his sport. There were no&#xD;
fish at the bridge worth catching, he said.&#xD;
"Then let us go home," Charlotte proposed.&#xD;
He could not think of that; the charm of leading her through&#xD;
those sweet solitudes was too pleasant to be broken.&#xD;
" Do not be faint-hearted," said he. " If we go a little further&#xD;
we can pass by Mr. Jackwood's house, and, perhaps, get a glimpse&#xD;
of Phoebe's bright face, on our way home."&#xD;
And Charlotte still had power to do only what he asked, and&#xD;
follow where he led.&#xD;
&#xD;
X.&#xD;
MRS. RIGGLESTY'S ADVENTURE,&#xD;
Tin grandmother of the Jackwood family, like the greatest&#xD;
great-grandmother of us all, was tempted by an apple. It came&#xD;
floating down Huntersford Creek, and was discerned by the modern&#xD;
Eve, as she walked upon the shore, filling her apron -not a fig-&#xD;
leaf-with floodwood fagots for the kitchen fire.&#xD;
"A good nice June-eatin', true as I live!" said grandmother&#xD;
Rigglesty, sneezing at the sun in the water. "It 's a pity to have&#xD;
it wasted." She looked about for a long stick. " I never see !&#xD;
Time an' ag'in 't I 've stumbled over sticks in this 'ere shif'-&#xD;
liss pastor', now  I can't, for the life o' me, lay my hand on&#xD;
one!"&#xD;
The best she could find was a heavy, crooked branch, which&#xD;
proved to be some less than an inch too short.&#xD;
"It 's jest the way alluz !" she burst forth, getting up from her&#xD;
bent posture. " Everything is so hateful! I've broke my back,&#xD;
and wet my foot, into the bargain! Sich an awk'ard stick !"&#xD;
All this time the apple, tossing in the bright waves by the&#xD;
shore, was progressing still further from her own mouth, towards&#xD;
the mouth of the creek. She followed, until, her eye resting upon&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood's old flat-bottomed boat, she hastened to get aboard,&#xD;
deposited her apron of fagots in the stern, which lay upon the&#xD;
shore, and placed the dry seat for a bridge over the bilge-water&#xD;
that had settled in the bow. Upon this she ventured, armed with&#xD;
her crooked branch ; paddling patiently to divert the apple tow-&#xD;
ards her, until at length she was able to tickle it with the tips&#xD;
of her fingers. Then, after stretching and straining until she&#xD;
became purple in the face, she grasped it in her hand. At the&#xD;

112           MRS. RIGGLESTY'S ADVENTURE.&#xD;
same time she dropped the stick. Recovering the stick, she&#xD;
dropped the apple. Then she dropped them both. Regaining the&#xD;
fruit, she placed it on the bow of the boat; but, not feeling at&#xD;
home on a bow of that description, it quietly fell off, whilst she&#xD;
was recapturing the stick, and danced laughingly away in the sun-&#xD;
shine.&#xD;
"Hold on! dear me ! " she cried, making a desperate effort to&#xD;
recover it.&#xD;
The attempt proved literally fruitless; and, in her vexation, she&#xD;
threw the stick at it spitefully. Having bespattered herself pro-&#xD;
fusely, and lost both the apple and the branch, she crept back&#xD;
upon her bridge, with her features all knotted up in a snarl, and&#xD;
looked around for her apron of fagots. To her dismay, she found&#xD;
them afloat in the bilge-water, rushing back into the stern.&#xD;
The boat was unfastened, and, her operations serving to work it&#xD;
off the shore, she now saw herself sailing slowly and smoothly out&#xD;
into the stream.&#xD;
" Whoa! whoa!" cried grandmother Rigglesty, as if the boat&#xD;
had been a horse or an ox; "whoa, you sir ! -Bim'lech! Betsy!&#xD;
My sakes ! can't nobody hear?&#xD;
Somebody did hear. It was the dog Rover, who came caper-&#xD;
" Here, Rover ! " she cried, -" that's a good doggie ! Help&#xD;
me, cuick ! "&#xD;
Perhaps, anticipating the sinking of the boat, she looked for&#xD;
salvation in his bark. But the dog took quite an erroneous view&#xD;
of the case, regarding the call as of an entirely sportive nature.&#xD;
Considering his gallantry challenged to assist in some wild fun&#xD;
projected by the picturesque old lady, he leaped into the water,&#xD;
and commenced a furious attack upon the boat, with teeth and&#xD;
paws.&#xD;
p  0it out!" ejaculated grandmother Rigglesty -(he had not&#xD;
yet got in). "You '11 have me tipped over, sure 's this world ! "&#xD;
The more she was in earnest, the more Rover thought she was&#xD;
in fun, and persisted in jumping aboard in spite of her. The boat&#xD;
tipped frightfully, and grandmother Rigglesty screamed. Then&#xD;
Rover shook himself, showering her with spray as she sat perched&#xD;
&#xD;
MRS. RIGGLESTY S ADVENTURE.             113&#xD;
upon her plank; and she screamed again.   Thinking it very&#xD;
funny, he sat down good-naturedly in the bottom, and looked up'&#xD;
wistfully in her face, winking, and churning in the water with his&#xD;
tail. In her exasperation, she began to kick his chops; upon&#xD;
which he showed a disposition to take everything in good part, by&#xD;
playfully masticating her foot.&#xD;
Meanwhile the boat was filling rapidly, and threatening to go&#xD;
down, with all her crew on board. By some good fortune, how-&#xD;
ever, an island appeared, in the shape of a round bowlder, in mid-&#xD;
channel; and as the bow struck the rock, the old lady scrambled&#xD;
upon it, leaving her apron and fagots to float down stream in the&#xD;
abandoned wreck. Rover appeared to consider this phase of the&#xD;
adventure as the funniest of all, and endeavored to enhance the&#xD;
sport by crowding her off the rock, and by growling and snap-&#xD;
ping at her toes when she refused to jump into the water.&#xD;
At this pleasant juncture, a voice hailed from below; and Hec-&#xD;
for and Charlotte appeared, coming around a clump of bushes&#xD;
that grew upon the point of a knoll. Thereupon Rover, swim-&#xD;
ming to the bank, ran joyfully to his old acquaintance, and&#xD;
attempted to leap into her face, with intent to lick.&#xD;
"Go away ! " cried Charlotte. "I can't love you when you&#xD;
are so wet!"&#xD;
So Rover shook himself again, and set out to rub himself dry&#xD;
on Hector's trousers. But, being caught up suddenly by the legs,&#xD;
he described in the air, first a half-circle, then a tangent, then a&#xD;
gentle curve, -and afterwards came up, snuffing' apd paddling, in&#xD;
mid-channel, before he appeared to understand at all the nature&#xD;
of the phenomenon that had surprised him.&#xD;
Hector, to the old lady: "What have you got there, grand-&#xD;
mother?&#xD;
Old lady, crossly: "I'm in a strait -that 's what I've got !&#xD;
Don't stop to parley; but help me, if you're ever going' to! I&#xD;
est went to git an apple out o' the crick, when that hateful boat&#xD;
had to go off with me!!"&#xD;
"And did you get the apple ?"&#xD;
"No, I did n't! and that 's what makes me so provoked!"&#xD;
ector, gravely: "aIt might have been expected. I Once&#xD;

saw a juggler take an apple out of an orange; but I never yet&#xD;
heard of any person taking one out of a current."&#xD;
"I 'm sure I don't know a word you 're a talkin' about!"&#xD;
spluttered the old lady. " I'm ketchin' my death-cold here, -&#xD;
both feet soppin' wet, - I 'd have ye know ! "&#xD;
At this point, finding it difficult to restrain her emotions at&#xD;
sight of her old friend, Charlotte set out to make the Jackwoods&#xD;
a visit, leaving Hector to get the cast-away off the rock.&#xD;
" The trollop!" muttered grandmother Rigglesty. "I declare,&#xD;
if she wan't la'fin' right to my face !"&#xD;
" What do you say?" demanded Hector. "Take it back, or&#xD;
I'll not help you out of the creek!"&#xD;
" She'd no bizniss to la'ft!"&#xD;
"If she is human she could n't help it; you are a pleasing&#xD;
and picturesque spectacle, grandmother ! But you must be better-&#xD;
natured; you must be kind, and patient, and charitable, my dear&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
"I s'pose I was hasty," the old lady confessed, reluctantly.&#xD;
"But you need n't a' snapped me up on 't so short ! I did n't&#xD;
mean no harm!"&#xD;
" That '11 do pretty well for a beginning.- If you keep on, you&#xD;
will get to have quite a Christian temper," said Hector, "by the&#xD;
time you are old."&#xD;
The boat had gone aground upon a sand-bar near the bank, and&#xD;
Hector, reaching it with his fishing-pole, drew it towards him, and&#xD;
dragged it upon the shore.&#xD;
"Cultivate patience, grandmother !" he cried; "the craft&#xD;
stands in need of repairs."&#xD;
Having emptied the water, fagots and all, into the creek, he&#xD;
deliberately set about calking the boat with the old lady's apron.&#xD;
"Marcy on me ! " gasped grandmother Rigglesty; "I shall&#xD;
fly!"&#xD;
" Do so," said Hector ; " and you will save me this trouble. Be,&#xD;
careful, though, when you alight; you will frighten people."&#xD;
As she gaye no decided indication of going up, he went on with&#xD;
his calking, sparing no expense of time or calico in stopping the&#xD;
leaks. Having accomplished his work to his satisfaction, he&#xD;
&#xD;
MRS. RIGGLESTY'S ADVENTURE.             115&#xD;
launched the boat, jumped aboard with his fishing-pole, shoved out&#xD;
to the rock, and brought'the old lady safe to land.&#xD;
Strange as it may appear, she felt anything but emotions of&#xD;
benevolence and gratitude. Nothing could soothe her soreness of&#xD;
heart, and the rheumatic pains in her neck and back, like the&#xD;
balm of some sweet revenge. Accordingly, while Hector was&#xD;
picking the seams of her apron out of the seams of the boat, she&#xD;
commenced a similar operation upon Charlotte's character.&#xD;
"She 's 'a gal 't means well, -I can say that for her," she&#xD;
began, her fear of Hector preventing her from approaching the&#xD;
subject too openly, - "and when that 's the case, I 'm sure we'd&#xD;
oughter kinder lend a helpin' hand to anybody, no matter 'f&#xD;
they 've ben the wust critturs 't ever lived."&#xD;
Hector was interested; but, pretending indifference, he contin-&#xD;
-  ued to pick away at the old lady's apron. She at the same time&#xD;
picked away at Charlotte. She told the whole history of the dis-&#xD;
guise, and of the young girl's exposure, the day before she left&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood's. As it was the first intelligence of the kind&#xD;
Hector had received, it troubled him, his mind naturally revert-&#xD;
ing to what Charlotte had that morning said of her past life.&#xD;
Mrs. Rigglesty perceived her advantage, and pursued it venom-&#xD;
ously. She said she had known Charlotte for more than twelve&#xD;
years; and that, on a visit to her son Enoch, in North Nincum.&#xD;
where she belonged, she had learned all about her recent proceed-&#xD;
ings. These had led to the disgrace of her family, and to her&#xD;
own flight. The story was one that the old lady could not have&#xD;
invented; and the- confident manner in which she identified Miss&#xD;
Woods with the girl at North Nincum produced an overwhelming&#xD;
effect upon Hector.&#xD;
Meanwhile, in company with the bitter old lady, he arrived at&#xD;
the house. Phobe being absent, Charlotte was found in cover&#xD;
sation with Mrs. Jackwood, who was busy preparing dinner.&#xD;
Grandmother Rigglesty moved by them like a muttering cloud,&#xD;
dropping rain from her wet apron, which she gave a final twist,&#xD;
'  before hanging it upon the oven-door to dry.&#xD;
"0O! 0! "--starting and clapping her'hand behind her,-&#xD;
"my poor back !"&#xD;

MRS. RIGGLESTY'S ADVENTURE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood ran to her assistance : "I '1l take care o' that,&#xD;
mother ! "  spreading out the apron.=- " Sed down, Hector, -I&#xD;
can't make it come handy to call you Mr. Dunbury. -Le' me take&#xD;
off your wet shoes an' stockin's," - to, the old lady.&#xD;
"No, never mind ! I can do it, I guess, -if I can't, it 's jest&#xD;
as well. I wish that door could be kep' shet once ! There 's a&#xD;
draft of air comes right on to my shoulders and neck !"&#xD;
Charlotte arose and closed the door. Hector's eyes followed&#xD;
her with a searching look, which startled her, as she turned and&#xD;
caught his eye.&#xD;
" 0, don't trouble yourself, I beg! " said the old lady, as Mrs.&#xD;
Jackwood insisted on removing her wet stockings. "'T need n't&#xD;
make a mite o' difference, jes' cause there 's visitors here; they&#xD;
won't mind the looks, though you should n't think I 'm wuth&#xD;
makin' a fuss over,-for I'm sensible I an't, myself: I've had&#xD;
that lesson to larn perty thoroughly in my old age ! "&#xD;
And, with a disconsolate air, grandmother Rigglesty fumbled in&#xD;
her bag for the Good Samaritan, and consulted him in her trouble,&#xD;
as of old. Having dried her eyes, she looked down and saw&#xD;
Rover wagging his tail, and regarding her with an expression that.&#xD;
seemed to say, " Did n't we have capital fun? "-upon which she&#xD;
converted the handkerchief into a whip, and made a sudden and&#xD;
spiteful cut with it at the good-natured cur.&#xD;
" There ! I wish to goodness somebody 'd take that dog and&#xD;
chop .his head off! "&#xD;
"Why, what has the dog done?" cried Mrs. Jackwood.&#xD;
As she spoke, Rover rallied, and, making a pounce at the Good&#xD;
Samaritan, seized him with his teeth and paws, and began to&#xD;
,hake and tear him, in a prodigious sham fury.&#xD;
"You see what he 's done !" ejaculated the old lady. "0Gi' me&#xD;
them tongs !"&#xD;
Forgetting her rheumatism and wet feet, she started from the&#xD;
chair, and, with one stocking off, and one stocking on, like "my&#xD;
son John," of 'high-diddle-dumpling memory, commenced an ani-&#xD;
mated pursuit of Rover around the room. The poor dog was at&#xD;
last fairly cornered, and the forked thunderbolt was about to fall&#xD;
prone upon the head, and front of his offending, when the door&#xD;
&#xD;
MRS. RIGGLESTY'S ADVENTURE.       -      11'&#xD;
was opportunely opened, and Bim made- his appearance, blus-&#xD;
tering.&#xD;
" here, Rover !" he cried,-- "cut ! "&#xD;
At the word, with craven head, and tail depressed, Rover&#xD;
darted between the legs of his young master, and whisked out of&#xD;
the house, while the tongs came down upon the floor behind him&#xD;
with a jar which filled the old lady's arm with stings, from the&#xD;
fingers to the elbow.&#xD;
"There ! That 's all for you, you good-for-nothing ! I've&#xD;
broke my arm - perty nigh !"&#xD;
Bing, undaunted : " You might let the dog alone ! "&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood : " Bim'lech ! Bim'lech!"&#xD;
Bim, stoutly : "She begun it ! "&#xD;
Old lady : "0,I would n't interfere ! Let him sass me all&#xD;
he wants to ; that 's what I was made for, I s'pose ! It 's all&#xD;
owin' to him, 't I got my feet wet. He left the boat right where&#xD;
he know'd 't would go off with anybody if they jest stepped into&#xD;
it. I never see sich ugliness !"&#xD;
After that, there was a lull,- Mrs. Rigglesty heating her feet&#xD;
at the stove, with now and then a deep, prolonged sigh of ostenta-&#xD;
tious suffering; Bim looking sheepish, and drumming on the&#xD;
window, as Charlotte inquired about his health and spirits;&#xD;
Hector twirling his hat ; and Mrs. Jackwood apologizing.&#xD;
" Sakes alive ! " suddenly burst forth the. old .lady ; "look at&#xD;
that shoe! I declare if 't an't coming' to pieces ! Them new pair&#xD;
't I bought o' that plaguy pedler o' yourn, only 't other day, an'&#xD;
paid ten cents more for 'n I ever pay for shoes, on account o' the&#xD;
extry soles, an' now, the fust time they git a little grain wet,&#xD;
-only look at 'em'!"&#xD;
"When you have come to my years," said Hector, "you&#xD;
will have learned to beware of extra pretensions.  As with&#xD;
people, so with shoes. - Give me a glass of water, Mrs. Jack-&#xD;
wood, and we will go home. We are promised fish for dinner,&#xD;
and I have a foreshadowing of thirst."&#xD;
" Our well 's give out, this summer," said Mrs. Jackwood.&#xD;
"Phobe 's gone to the spring for water, an' I 'mi expectin' her-&#xD;
back every minute."&#xD;

"She 's off readin' that nasty novil, somewheres ! " spoke up&#xD;
grandmother Rigglesty. "She 's at it every chance she can git.&#xD;
I 'd burn it up, if she was a child o' mine ! "&#xD;
" If she was a child of mine "- said Hector.&#xD;
Old lady, sharply : "Wal, what if she was?"&#xD;
" Then you would be my mother ! - Good-by. - We '11 not&#xD;
wait for Phoebe.".&#xD;
Old lady, muttering: "I wish that door could be kep' shet !&#xD;
There, they're gone, arter so long a time ! That Hector 's jes'&#xD;
like his father, for all the world, - only more so, if anything ! "&#xD;
Bim, following the visitors to the gate, gave vent .to his feel-&#xD;
ings in breathing defiance against the old lady.&#xD;
" What are you going to do with that pipe ?" asked Charlotte.&#xD;
Bim, desperately: "It 's kern; and I 'm goin' to put some&#xD;
powder in it, an' blow her up, to pay her ! "&#xD;
Hector: "I take it, then, she blows you up, sometimes."&#xD;
" I don't care for her ! "-Bim swung his head, with a swag-&#xD;
gering expression. - "I put thistles in her han'kerchief, t' other&#xD;
day! Golly! did n't she scream ! "&#xD;
Charlotte, taking the boy's hand: "I'm afraid you are not so&#xD;
good to her as you might be."&#xD;
Bim, earnestly: "Who could ?-- Here, Rove," - pulling the&#xD;
dog's ears,"- "say good-by ! "&#xD;
"Yahowawoooiiii ! " said Rover, compromising a howl with a&#xD;
yawn.&#xD;
On the way home, Charlotte felt a cloud resting upon her&#xD;
spirit. It was heaviest and chillest when 'Hector was nearest.&#xD;
Through it his smiles looked cold, and his laugh sounded hard&#xD;
and hollow to her ear.&#xD;
He appeared to notice her but little, but went bowling large&#xD;
stones along the road; sometimes throwing them high in the air,&#xD;
and catching them dexterously as they came down.&#xD;
"This is life ! How we poor mortals toil and sweat over our&#xD;
serious games ! And what is the result of it all ?  A little dust,&#xD;
like that this cobble raises in the road !"&#xD;
The missile, bounding from the path, leaped through the fence&#xD;
into a clump of bushes, growing on the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
MRS. RIGGLESTY'S ADVENTURE.             119&#xD;
" 0 dear ! 0! 0! 0!" screamed a shrill voice ; and straight-&#xD;
way out ran a wild-looking creature into the field, bareheaded,&#xD;
with hair flying, and hands clasped over her ears.&#xD;
" Ha ! " said Hector, "there 's unexpected game'!"&#xD;
" I am afraid she is hurt ! " cried Charlotte.&#xD;
" Not she; else she would scream less, according to the rule of&#xD;
shams. If a man is frightened, he blusters; if hurt, he says lit.&#xD;
tle; if killed, he maintains a wise silence. This holds good, as a&#xD;
general rule; but perhaps Phoebe Jackwood is an exception.-&#xD;
Are you hurt, Phoebe ?"&#xD;
Phoebe : "I guess so! I'm so scar't I don't know a word I&#xD;
do, or anything I say ! What was that ?"&#xD;
" A hailstone, Phoebe !  Come here, and let me look at the&#xD;
hole in your head."&#xD;
Phoebe,.quickly putting up her hand: " Is there one? Where?&#xD;
tell me !&#xD;
"Give me your hand, and I'll show you."&#xD;
She ran up to the fence, and Hector reached over to her. "It&#xD;
opens every time you speak. There ! "  And, placing her finger&#xD;
in her mouth, he closed her teeth upon it.&#xD;
"That 's just like you, Hector Dunbury ! If 't was anybody&#xD;
else, I never 'd speak to you again ! "&#xD;
Pouting a little, and blushing a good deal, Phoebe ran behind&#xD;
the sumachs, confusedly putting up her hair by the way.&#xD;
"Is that what you call a hailstone ?" she cried, tossing the&#xD;
cobble over the fence. "You threw it !"&#xD;
-*" To be sure ; and it was a friendly hail, Phoebe. You should&#xD;
have hailed me pleasantly in return, instead of going off in a&#xD;
fright."&#xD;
"I guess you 'd 'ave been frightened to have a great rock&#xD;
come thrashing through the bushes on to your head, when youz&#xD;
was asleep ! Would n't he, Charlotte ?"&#xD;
"If anything could frighten him," said Charlotte. "What&#xD;
book have you?"&#xD;
" Alonzo and Melissa.  Did you ever read it?   I wish IL&#xD;
had n't begun it, for I don't like it a bit,- but I can 't let it&#xD;
alone till it 's fini-shed, any way. I set up till two o'clock last&#xD;

night, and got so excited over it that when I went to bed I&#xD;
could n't sleep a wink, but see balls of fire, and heard doors slam,&#xD;
and felt cold hands on my arm, all the rest of the night ; and I've&#xD;
been so sleepy all day I can't hardly keep my eyes open."&#xD;
Phoebe handed the book to Charlotte through the rails ; then,.&#xD;
having passed her pail of water over to Hector, and asked him&#xD;
to turn around, and not look, she began to climb the fence.&#xD;
Hector made a cup of a basswood-leaf, and, having filled it for&#xD;
Charlotte to drink, and afterwards -drank out of it himself, shook&#xD;
the water from it into Phoebe's face.I&#xD;
" You are a dull girl to fall asleep over Alonzo and Melissa !&#xD;
Good-by. Your mother is waiting for you."&#xD;
" Dont hurry off so! I would n't have got over the fence, only&#xD;
I thought you 'd stop and talk a minute."&#xD;
" I 've no minute to spare. Time is precious, Phoebe, and I&#xD;
hear Bridget blowing the dinner-horn. Go, and take that fatal&#xD;
stone with you, as a keepsake. It has waked you from one&#xD;
dream of romance ; and it may save you from many another, if&#xD;
you will treasure it as a type of man's heart, and look at it&#xD;
whenever you think of falling in love."&#xD;
" If \that is a type of man's heart, what is a type of wom-&#xD;
an's ?" asked Charlotte.&#xD;
" Still a stone, but it should be hollow. And yet not every&#xD;
heart is so -not every heart !" added Hector, in a changed&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
He :walked away with Charlotte in silence, leaving the gay&#xD;
Phoebe to.roll the cobble carefully in her apron, and carry it to&#xD;
the house with her pail of water.&#xD;
Scarce another word was spoken by either Hector or his com-&#xD;
panion, until they reached home. Then, as they were passing&#xD;
under the porch, Charlotte, whose heart was full, could restrain&#xD;
herself no longer.&#xD;
"How dissatisfied you are with me to-day ! " she said, in a low,&#xD;
tremulous tone.&#xD;
"With all the world, and with myself most of all !" rejoined&#xD;
Rector.&#xD;
Charlotte would have asked " Why ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
MRS. RIGGLESTY'S ADVENTURE.             121&#xD;
" Because," said Hector, perceiving her thoughts, "I have&#xD;
made a discovery."&#xD;
Discovery ! The word fell upon her heart with stunning&#xD;
power ; for a moment nerve and breath and strength were taken&#xD;
away, and she wished that she might fall down at Hector's feet,&#xD;
and never rise up more.&#xD;
" It is," he added, smiling bitterly,--" I have left my fishing-&#xD;
pole at Mr. Jackwood's!"&#xD;
He strode through the hall; while Charlotte, following, and&#xD;
finding her way to her room, sank, almost lifelessly, upon her bed,&#xD;
and lay there in trance-like despair, until the harsh voice of&#xD;
Bridget came to announce'that the pickerel was on the table, and&#xD;
the dinner waiting.&#xD;

DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
. XI.&#xD;
DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS.&#xD;
FROM that day Hector's conduct towards Charlotte was marked&#xD;
by strange inconsistencies. Sometimes, spontaneously, from his&#xD;
lips the tenderest words fell like warm rain upon the flowers of her&#xD;
heart ; then the lightning of his wit flashed out upon her, sharp&#xD;
and sudden, from the cloud of his bitter melancholy ; or the cold&#xD;
breath of his assumed indifference chilled her like the north wind.&#xD;
One day, when she had suffered extremely from his fitful&#xD;
treatment, Mrs. Dunbury called her to her side.  The good&#xD;
woman was reposing in her easy-chair, and her countenance&#xD;
beamed with a broken and sorrowful smile as Charlotte drew near,&#xD;
and seated herself at her feet.&#xD;
" My dear child," -- and the invalid laid her hand with a&#xD;
gentle touch upon the young girl's head, -"my heart compels&#xD;
me to speak to you on a subject which we have both avoided too&#xD;
long. Let us be true, let us be friends indeed, Charlotte, if&#xD;
not for my sake or yours, then for my son's - for Hector's."-&#xD;
There was a pause. Charlotte's very soul stood still, and the&#xD;
silence seemed to ring as she listened. -" You will tell me if I&#xD;
am wrong, but I think - I am sure - Hector loves you ! "&#xD;
.Charlotte started, and gazed with a questioning look into her&#xD;
friend's benignant face.&#xD;
"If it is so," said Mrs. Dunbury, " I shall not be displeased.&#xD;
Only tell me true."&#xD;
" But it is not so! " exclaimed Charlotte, with singular vehe-&#xD;
mence. "He dislikes me ! - you know he does!"&#xD;
If you say so, my child, I will believe at least that you think&#xD;
3ut I imagined he had made advances to you -"&#xD;
&#xD;
I:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Never ! never!"&#xD;
" You will pardon me, then, for troubling you," said the invalid;&#xD;
"but, 0,"- with starting tears,--"if you but knew how much his&#xD;
destiny depends upon the affections of his heart!, I will tell you a&#xD;
secret, Charlotte. There is -it is better that you should know--&#xD;
a taint in our family of-hereditary insanity."&#xD;
A thrill of horror shot through Charlotte.&#xD;
"I am a mother," the invalid said, " and I am, perhaps, weak&#xD;
and foolish.  But this concerns you, and I need your aid and&#xD;
sympathy."&#xD;
"What have I done ?  What can I do?" demanded Charlotte.&#xD;
" Be quiet, my good child, and hear me. I see no safety for my&#xD;
son but in a happy marriage; nor can I be at rest until I behold his&#xD;
tempest-tossed passion anchored in some pure and loving bosom,&#xD;
like your own. A misplaced affection is the most I have to fear.&#xD;
There, dear Charlotte," -the invalid dropped a tear on her com-&#xD;
panion's hand, -." I have laid open to you the most sacred apart-&#xD;
ment of my heart : you will not profane the trust, I know."&#xD;
For the moment, Charlotte was overpowered with conflicting&#xD;
emotions. Amazement and distress, not unaccompanied by a cer-&#xD;
tain vague, fearful joy, sent the swift crimson and pallor chasing&#xD;
each other in her face. Twice she attempted to speak ; then, sink-&#xD;
ing upon her knees before her friend, she hid her face in that&#xD;
maternal lap, and wept. Embracing her, and soothing her with&#xD;
sympathetic words, Mrs. Dunbury lifted her up. Then, with a&#xD;
firm but gentle dignity, Charlotte spoke.&#xD;
"I am grateful, I cannot tell you how grateful, for your kind&#xD;
thoughts of me, and your good will  I would lay down my life&#xD;
for you, and count it as nothing. But I can never be Hector's&#xD;
he can never be mine ! "&#xD;
" One word," said Mrs. Dunbury, in a faint voice; "could yoi&#xD;
love him?"&#xD;
"That is a thought which even in my. dreams I have not&#xD;
dared to entertain."&#xD;
" Ah, Charlotte !  I think Iread in your heart what you dare&#xD;
not read yourself. Cover it up, - cover it, by all means, from&#xD;
s ;  him,-until he calls for it."&#xD;

"He will never call for it ! And if he should," exclaimed&#xD;
Charlotte, "I could not give it him ! I will go ; I will leave&#xD;
your house this day ! It will be better for me, - better for you&#xD;
and him."&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury strained her to her bosom. Charlotte struggled&#xD;
to free. herself.&#xD;
"You know not whom you take to your heart !" she said, with&#xD;
increased passion. " And your son, if he has a thought of love&#xD;
for me, ho knows not how worse than thrown away it is ! We&#xD;
are divided by a destiny sharper than swords ! Do not question&#xD;
me, for I can tell you nothing. Because I cannot, - because, if&#xD;
I stay, I must conceal and deceive ; because I would not repay&#xD;
your kindness and trust by such ingratitude,-I will go, and go&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
"No, Charlotte, you, shall stay ! Keep your secret," said the&#xD;
invalid, "if you will ; but stay, dear Charlotte, and you will not&#xD;
only confer a blessing on me, but perhaps save another from the&#xD;
worst fate that can befall."&#xD;
Charlotte was deeply moved.&#xD;
"No, no ! I must not, I cannot ! Your love burns me like&#xD;
fire ! "&#xD;
" Hush!" said Mrs. Dunbury. "I hear his step."&#xD;
Scarcely had Charlotte time to regain her feet, when the door&#xD;
opened. Hector entered, and threw himself upon a chair, while&#xD;
the curtains of the recess, behind which she had hastily taken&#xD;
refuge, were still rustling.&#xD;
"Where have you been, my son?"&#xD;
"Upon the mountain, to free my lungs, mother.   I should&#xD;
stifle if I did. not climb occasionally above the reek of human&#xD;
breaths. I fell asleep under a tree, and waked to find 4 wood-&#xD;
chuck smelling of my boot. The mantle-hem of civilization lies&#xD;
so thin and ravelled on that altitude, that the wild beasts have&#xD;
not yet become corrupted by the acquaintance of man."&#xD;
" How pale you look ! Are you ill?"&#xD;
"No, mother. I have been fighting."&#xD;
" Fighting, my son ! With whom ?"&#xD;
" With my worst enemy, dear mother."&#xD;
&#xD;
DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS.                  125&#xD;
"0, why do you have these terrible struggles with yourself?"&#xD;
"Because I find in myself that rebellion which is to be&#xD;
crushed!"&#xD;
"I would you were a Christian !" breathed the pious woman.&#xD;
" I would I were, indeed ; for if I had that grace, I might&#xD;
convert another, -then the world could boast of two."&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury changed her tactics : " You should be married,&#xD;
Hector."&#xD;
" Why, so I should ; and so should every man. But how much&#xD;
easier it is said than done!"&#xD;
"You vex me when you talk so. You might have been married&#xD;
five years ago."&#xD;
"After a fashion, mother ; but I thank my stars that my neck&#xD;
escaped the yoke ; for I have learned to prize in woman high&#xD;
qualities never dreamed of in the heat and passion of my youth.&#xD;
What if I were united to such a one as I should then have&#xD;
chosen ?"  Hector shuddered.  "God be praised for the institu-&#xD;
tion of oldmaids and bachelors, say I !"&#xD;
He took up a book. But, having commenced to sound him on&#xD;
a subject near to her heart, his mother pursued it still.&#xD;
"You must not look for perfection, my son."&#xD;
"I look for nothing, - only for the heart that can command the&#xD;
full power of mine."&#xD;
"Need you go far for that ?  If you do not require wealth, or&#xD;
position, there are certainly women of soul -"&#xD;
"Name one, mother ! "&#xD;
"To speak at random," said Mrs. Dunbury, carelessly,-"or,&#xD;
rather, to commence nearest home, there is -"&#xD;
"Charlotte !" added Hector, with a smile, glancing towards&#xD;
the recess.&#xD;
" Perhaps she would not have you," said the invalid, with an&#xD;
    affected laugh; " but you might make the attempt."&#xD;
" Mother," said Hector, severely, " if you jest, your wit is un-&#xD;
seasonable. If you are in earnest, your speech lacks discretion.&#xD;
S Charlotte may be all a fond mother could wish for her darling son,&#xD;
but certainly you would not expect me to marry her unless I&#xD;
loved her."&#xD;

126               DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS.&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury's eyes glistened. "How can you help loving&#xD;
her ?"&#xD;
"How can you help loving - pickles ?"&#xD;
"That 's a foolish question, Hector."&#xD;
"Or an answer to a foolish question, dear mother !"&#xD;
Hector threw down the book, and left the room.&#xD;
" Charlotte ! " whispered Mrs. Dunbury.&#xD;
Very pale, but with a fair, calm dignity of mien, Charlotte&#xD;
came forth.&#xD;
"Did you hear what was said?"&#xD;
"I have heard all ! "&#xD;
" And you are not offended ?"&#xD;
"0, no, I am glad ! " said Charlotte, smiling.&#xD;
" And -you will not leave us?"&#xD;
"Not unless you wish it. I am stronger now, and I will stay."&#xD;
She spoke with her graceful form drawn up to its full height,&#xD;
with the roused spirit of pride shining through her face, and flash-&#xD;
ing in her eyes.&#xD;
At that moment Hector returned for his hat. Taking it from&#xD;
the table, he passed on, and opened the curtains before the recess&#xD;
where the girl had stood.&#xD;
"What are you looking for? " asked his mother.&#xD;
"Excuse me, - but I am trying to discover what has made&#xD;
Charlotte grow so tall, and given her so fine a color, within the&#xD;
last five minutes."&#xD;

XII.&#xD;
THE WEDDING.&#xD;
THERE was to be a wedding in the village, to which the Dun-&#xD;
burys were invited; and it devolved upon Hector to represent the&#xD;
family. To his mother's surprise and gratification, he engaged to&#xD;
undertake the responsibility, upon one condition. " Charlotte,"&#xD;
said he, "shall go with me."&#xD;
Charlotte shrank from the thought of seeing society; but she -&#xD;
had no good excuse to offer-not even on the score of dress; for&#xD;
since her residence with the Dunburys she had been liberally pro-&#xD;
vided for, in that respect.  Notwithstanding, therefore, certain&#xD;
forebodings she had, she suffered herself to be overcome by solici-&#xD;
tation, and gave her. promise to accompany Hector.&#xD;
The ceremony was to take place in the evening; and in due&#xD;
season Corny brought the horse and buggy to the door.&#xD;
"It is a brave wedding we are going to !" said Hector, as&#xD;
he drove away. " The fair young bride is in her thirty-fifth sum-&#xD;
mer,-a little gray and faded, but for the virtues of a judicious&#xD;
hair-wash, and the excellent care taken of her complexion. When&#xD;
I was a school-boy, aged ten, she was the belle of the village, and&#xD;
had as many lovers as she could count on her fingers and toes.&#xD;
Old men renewed -their age to become her suitors, and boys were&#xD;
as sure to fall in love with her as t-hey were to have down an&#xD;
their chins. It was expected of them, just as we look for measles&#xD;
in children. I was one of the predestinated, and at sixteen expe-&#xD;
rienced two days of excessive melancholy in consequence of &#xD;
rejection. Well, having suffered the first and second generation&#xD;
of her admirers to pass away, she has chosen one out of a third&#xD;
thin brood of weaklings, who have managed to get up a feeble&#xD;
show of the ancient custom, in these latter days."&#xD;

I'&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WEDDING.&#xD;
&#xD;
Charlotte hoped the bridegroom was worthy.&#xD;
" 0, he is worthy enough, -although, to speak truth, she&#xD;
would not have lowered even her haughty glance to his level, five&#xD;
years ago."&#xD;
" Why will she now, then?"&#xD;
" Because he stands to her in the interesting position of a last&#xD;
chance for a husband. And it is so very horrible to live an old&#xD;
maid, you know !'&#xD;
" But," said Charlotte, "it is dreadful -such a union ! "&#xD;
"0, it will do, it*will do, as matches average!"&#xD;
Arrived at the bride's house, Hector and Charlotte were ushered&#xD;
into the presence of a large company in a crowded apartment, -&#xD;
some silent, some conversing in subdued voices, and all very&#xD;
solemn.&#xD;
"If I had never been to a wedding before," whispered Hector,&#xD;
I should think we had made a mistake, and got into a funeral."&#xD;
Suddenly there was a hush, and the happy pair, appearing with&#xD;
the bridesmaids and groomsmen, marched to the place assigned&#xD;
them in the light of the wax candles. The centre of observation&#xD;
was of course the bride. She was'of such commanding presence,&#xD;
that the pretty Mr. Creston, with his weak face and slender shoul-&#xD;
ders, seemed scarce noticeable at her side.&#xD;
" How pale she looks !" said Bertha Wing, who sat with Mr.&#xD;
Rukely, at Charlotte's left hand. " What a strange brightness in&#xD;
her eye !"&#xD;
Hector turned with a smile which sent the blood tingling to&#xD;
her cheeks.&#xD;
"She is taking her last look at her bright ideal, Bertha. Or&#xD;
perhaps the phantoms of a thousand old-time lovers are flitting&#xD;
between her and the light."&#xD;
Bertha, troubled : " She will be happier when it is all over."&#xD;
Hector : "So you may say of a drowning man ! "&#xD;
Mr. Rukely, mildly: "Let us have charity ! "&#xD;
Hector : "Amen, with all my heart ! Yet it stirs the gall&#xD;
within me, to see a woman, capable of loving, desecrate the sanc-&#xD;
tity of her soul by mumblingvows with one utterly powerless to&#xD;
call her passion out!"&#xD;
&#xD;
128&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WEDDING.                     129&#xD;
Bertha, becoming suddenly pale as the bride, looked hastily&#xD;
around, to see if the remark had been overheard. Mr. Rukely&#xD;
smiled benignly, and, making a sign for silence, directed attention&#xD;
to the ceremony.&#xD;
This was performed by a staid old clergyman of the village,&#xD;
who married the happy couple fast and strong, and blessed the&#xD;
union. Congratulations and kisses followed ; and at length&#xD;
refreshments were introduced, -jellies, nuts, coffee, and several&#xD;
kinds of costly cake, all very fine and very indigestible, together&#xD;
with a feast of reason, to which the company was invited by the&#xD;
bridegroom's uncle. He was a wrinkle-browed, snuff-taking, old-&#xD;
fashioned individual, with a wise grimace, spectacles, and stiff&#xD;
iron-gray hair stuck up all over his head.&#xD;
"My daughter Etty," said he, enunciating with slow precision,&#xD;
" has prepared a poetical address, appropriate to the occasion,&#xD;
which she will proceed to deliver. -.Etty !"&#xD;
A girl of thirteen, with a large forehead and great eyes, sup-&#xD;
posed to be a genius, stepped forward promptly.&#xD;
"It's all her own composition," remarked the child's mother,&#xD;
by way of prologue.  "She wrote it without any assistance."&#xD;
" Mrs. Greenwich," interrupted her husband, with lofty disap-&#xD;
probation, " I am talking now! iDaughter !"- raising his hand,&#xD;
-"one, two, three, -begin !"&#xD;
At the word, Etty rattled away, like a militia company firing at&#xD;
command, with a volley of blank verses levelled at the newly-&#xD;
married pair.&#xD;
Mother, parenthetically: "Not quite so fast, daughter."&#xD;
Father, severely: " I'1l dictate, if you please, Mrs. Green-&#xD;
wich!"&#xD;
The lady nodded deferentially. Etty went on, holding her&#xD;
hands stiffly folded across her lap, and looking down, as if reciting&#xD;
to the carpet. The substance of the poem was, that the happy&#xD;
pair were a strong oak and a graceful vine yoked together in the-&#xD;
car of matrimony, and sailing over a sapphire ocean, in a little Eden&#xD;
of their own, fall of flowery fountains, rainbows, the prodigal son,&#xD;
S  and the wise virgins with the oil in their lamps. Quite a round&#xD;
of applause greeted the conclusion.&#xD;

130                   THE WEDDING.&#xD;
"I want you all to understand," said the mother of the genius,&#xD;
" that the poem was composed in one hour and forty minutes - "&#xD;
" Mrs. Greenwich ! I was about to speak !"&#xD;
Mrs. G., meekly: "0, certainly !"&#xD;
Mr. G.: " Daughter ! "&#xD;
Young genius, prettily : " What, father ?"&#xD;
" I want you to recite the last part again, commencing at the&#xD;
line, ' There Flora spreads,' and let your voice rise at 'spangled&#xD;
groves.' Slowly and distinctly."&#xD;
Encouraged by the praises already bestowed, Etty repeated the&#xD;
concluding lines with improved confidence, and won additional&#xD;
applause.- The bride, who had borne up under the infliction with&#xD;
smiling patience, thanked the little prodigy for her compliments&#xD;
and good wishes, and asked for a copy of the verses.&#xD;
" A copy for me, too, Etty," said the bridegroom.&#xD;
Blushing bridesmaid: "I speak for a copy ! "&#xD;
Two or three, in a breath: "Me, too, Etty!"&#xD;
Chorus of voices: "Wonderful genius ! "-- " Be-e-e-eautiful ! "&#xD;
"Sweet pretty ! "-" Ought to be printed ! "&#xD;
Mr. Greenwich : "Daughter, what have you got to say?"&#xD;
Young genius, ready with a speech : "I thank you all very&#xD;
kindly for your good opinion--"&#xD;
Mrs. Greenwich, in a whisper: "Go on, - what is it about&#xD;
talents ?"&#xD;
" If God has seen fit to endow me with talents, I ought not to&#xD;
take any credit to myself, but show my gratitude by trying to&#xD;
make a good use of them. At the same time, I trust my friends&#xD;
will be less ready to praise than to tell me of my faults."&#xD;
More applause. Little prodigy's head quite turned. Mrs. G.&#xD;
excited and silly. Mr. G. prosy on the subject of his daughter's&#xD;
talents.&#xD;
Bertha, holding Etty's hand : "Come and see ne, and I 'II give&#xD;
you a pretty subject for a poem."&#xD;
Hector: "Come and see me, and I '11 give you something&#xD;
better."&#xD;
Young genius, with a curtsey: " Thank you! May I ask&#xD;
what it would be ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE -WEDDING.                    181&#xD;
Hector : " Some good advice."&#xD;
Young genius : " I suppose you do not like my poetry, then."&#xD;
" My child," said Hector, kindly, drawing her towards him, "I&#xD;
like you'"-he dropped his voice-" much better than I like&#xD;
your verses. You can afford to let me say so much, can't you,&#xD;
since everybody else is praising them? You said your friends&#xD;
were to tell you of your faults ; and if you would like to have me&#xD;
mention one little one, to begin with -"&#xD;
The genius repulsed him peevishly, and went pouting to her&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
Mrs. G., resentfully : " What have you been saying to her ?"&#xD;
Hector smiled: " The truth, simply. Is she so unaccustomed&#xD;
to the taste of that article, that it bites her tongue ?"&#xD;
There was a good deal of disapprobation expressed, in an indi&#xD;
rect way, against- Hector's proceeding, generally by those who&#xD;
experienced a secret joy at the young prodigy's discomfiture.&#xD;
" And you, Charlotte, -you blame me with the rest?"&#xD;
"Were -you not a little cruel ? " answered Charlotte.&#xD;
"Charlotte," - a deep emotion struggled in Hector's voice, -&#xD;
" I could endure that every person here to-night should misjudge&#xD;
me, malign me, think me ill-natured and egotistical, except you ! "&#xD;
The young girl felt a joyous thrill. Why was it? Had she&#xD;
not believed and preached to her poor heart,. night and day, that&#xD;
there was, there could be, no one single slenderest tie of sympathy&#xD;
between her and Hector ?&#xD;
"I was cruel," said he, " because I would be kind. And,&#xD;
believe me, to wound the poor child's feelings as I did, was the&#xD;
hardest thing I have had to do for weeks, - except when I have&#xD;
so often wounded yours!"&#xD;
"You thought it necessary to give me pain!"         A.&#xD;
"Yes, - and no. I cannot explain now. I have wronged you !&#xD;
Not so much in my acts as in my thoughts. I have so much to&#xD;
say to you!"&#xD;
Charlotte could not speak one word. She could not raise her&#xD;
eyes. The sound of Mr. Rukely's voice .recalled her to herself.&#xD;
lie had taken Hector's place at hbr side. But his words rustled&#xD;
merely, and fell away from her like husks. He left her to give&#xD;

THE WEDDING.&#xD;
&#xD;
room to others. Already her rare graces had made her the centre&#xD;
of an admiring circle, and frivolous young men brought compli-&#xD;
ments to purchase her smiles. Their commonplace prattle wearied&#xD;
her ; it cost an effort to treat them with civility ; and she was&#xD;
glad when the arrival of an unexpected guest occasioned a whirl&#xD;
of interest, which left her, for a moment, free to follow her own&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
. Her mind was with Hector. Amid all the throng and buzz, she&#xD;
saw his form and heard the music of his voice alone. Until ONE&#xD;
came between her and him. It was the new guest. She saw the&#xD;
two shake hands with a certain freedom which betokened old&#xD;
familiar acquaintance. She saw the new face, she heard the new&#xD;
voice, she felt the new presence, with a sudden overwhelming&#xD;
shock. What followed she knew not, until she found herself, all&#xD;
unnerved and shaken, clinging to the door of the dressing-room,,&#xD;
:whither she had instinctively fled.&#xD;
It was a small apartment, with a -bed at one side, covered with&#xD;
bonnets and shawls, and a bureau opposite, on which there was a&#xD;
lamp burning dimly in the gloom. In utter helplessness, she. sank&#xD;
upon a chair. But a rustling of the bed-curtains warned her that&#xD;
she was not alone. Among the garments thrown upon the side&#xD;
of the bed, an object moved, arose, and turned upon her a child's&#xD;
face, with eyes that shone large, and red, and swollen, in the dull&#xD;
light of the lamp. It was Etty, the genius.'&#xD;
"Have you seen him? " .she asked, timidly.&#xD;
Charlotte controlled as well as she could the agitation of her&#xD;
heart, and said, kindly, "Have I seen whom?"&#xD;
"My brother Robert. I had been crying ; and he always\&#xD;
used to dislike me when I cried, - so I ran in here. He has&#xD;
been away a year; and I have wanted him to come home so&#xD;
much ! But he won't care to see me, - do you think he will ?'&#xD;
The .child seemed to cling to Charlotte for sympathy and&#xD;
help. She was a child indeed then. The genius and the prod-&#xD;
igy had disappeared. The hard shell of affectation, in which&#xD;
her young nature was cased, was burst by the swelling of her&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
" Yes," - Charlotte scarce knowing what she said, - "I am&#xD;
sure he will be glad to see you, -if he is your brother."&#xD;
&#xD;
'THE WEDDING.                    183&#xD;
"But he never answered my letters, and I wrote him such long&#xD;
ones, and took so much pains with them ! I wish you would go&#xD;
out with me to see him !"&#xD;
", no, -that would do no good ! All your friends are out&#xD;
there; and I-- I am a stranger to all of you, you know."&#xD;
'"I don't care; you don't seem so. I 'd rather you would go&#xD;
=      with me, than mother, or father, or any of them. I can't tell&#xD;
why, but you ,make me feel so."&#xD;
Charlotte took the child in her arms, and pressed her close.&#xD;
" You are a good girl," said she, " and I 'm sure your brother&#xD;
can't help loving you, if you are always simple and true."&#xD;
- "He says I am so odd!"&#xD;
"Perhaps that is because you try too hard to be a lady, and&#xD;
are not enough a child. But no matter now. Go out and see&#xD;
him. And-would you be afraid to speak to Mr. Dunbury ?"&#xD;
"He did n't like my poetry ! " said the child, quickly.&#xD;
" Perhaps the fault was as much in your poetry as in him,"&#xD;
suggested Charlotte.&#xD;
"fI know it was! They were silly lines, and I never will write&#xD;
any more as long as I live ! "&#xD;
"0, yes, you will write more, -and write a great deal better&#xD;
for what he told you. I know he meant it kindly."&#xD;
"I will speak to him, if yoi wish me to," said Etty, thought-&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
" And say that I am here, and would like to see him."&#xD;
The child was glad to do anything to oblige her new friend;&#xD;
and, having dried her eyes, and made Charlotte tell her again&#xD;
that her brother would be glad to see her, she went timidly forth.&#xD;
Left to her own thoughts, Charlotte endeavored to be calm.&#xD;
She felt a powerful impulse to tell Hector everything, throw her-&#xD;
self upon his ,mercy, and then, if he cast her from him - Cast her&#xD;
from him ! The thought chilled her ; and when, at length, she&#xD;
heard a hand on the latch, she shrank within herself, and would,&#xD;
if possible, have fled even from his sight.&#xD;
But the comer was not Hector. It was Etty again.&#xD;
" I dropped my handkerchief," said the child, getting down to'&#xD;
look for it on the floor.&#xD;

184                  THE WEDDING.&#xD;
" Here it is, by my feet." Charlotte took it up, and gave it&#xD;
her.&#xD;
Etty, wiping her eyes: " Thank you. Itold Mr. Dunbury, and&#xD;
he said he would come. I saw Robert, too; but he only just&#xD;
looked at me, and went on talking and laughing with the rest, as&#xD;
if I was nobody ! I don't care now ! He hates me, and I might&#xD;
have known he would."&#xD;
At that moment Hector entered. Etty tried to escape, but he&#xD;
caught her in his arms.&#xD;
"i Do you dislike me very much for what I said?"&#xD;
She hid her face ; and Hector kissed her forehead.&#xD;
" I believed that you had a true heart, and a real desire to do&#xD;
well," he said, kindly ; " so I thought it best to tell you of your&#xD;
faults, in order that you might correct them. You must be&#xD;
patient and humble, and aim at something more excellent than&#xD;
indiscriminate praise, if you would have your wings grow out&#xD;
beautiful and strong. You have wings ; but, 0, you only flutter&#xD;
with them a little now, instead of flying into the very dome of&#xD;
heaven, as your flatterers would have you think. This is what I -&#xD;
wanted to say to you; now, if you dislike me for it, I am very&#xD;
sorry."&#xD;
Hector kissed her again, and told her that she might go. How&#xD;
noble and good he seemed to Charlotte then! Etty felt comforted.&#xD;
He had touched a chord that had never been touched before.&#xD;
As he was about to speak again, the door opened. A qualm&#xD;
smote Charlotte's heart, as she heard once more the tones of that&#xD;
dreaded voice.&#xD;
" Ah ! here is the fugitive !"  The speaker paused at the door.&#xD;
Charlotte felt cold from head to foot. But she did not stir, nor&#xD;
raise her eyes, nor betray any sign of emotion, save in the pallor&#xD;
of her face. .- -" I beg pardon ! "-- smiling and bowing. "Is that&#xD;
you, Hector?   Who would have thought of stumbling upon&#xD;
ycu here ?  I suppose I ought to know that lady, too - but -&#xD;
such a dim, religious light -excuse me, - I was looking for&#xD;
that choice sister of mine."&#xD;
He patted Etty's cheek, -at the same time, his keen eyes&#xD;
glancing at Charlotte. -&#xD;

THE WEDDING.                    135&#xD;
"We have just been getting a little acquainted," said Hector,&#xD;
giving Etty into her brother's arms. "She is too good a heart to&#xD;
be a sister of yours."&#xD;
"So our beloved mother says ! She thought I hurt your feel-&#xD;
ings, just now, sis, and sent me to ask your forgiveness."&#xD;
"0, no -you did not.-"&#xD;
" She has scolded me, too, for not answering your letters. You&#xD;
did n't mind that, though, - for you knew I never liked school-&#xD;
girl compositions. Come, don't pout ! I was in hopes you had&#xD;
outgrown your odd ways. Is this lady your friend, too?"&#xD;
Etty, struggling from him, reached the door and escaped. He&#xD;
followed her, pausing, as he went, to apologize once more for his&#xD;
intrusion. Then Hector, impatient, closed the door, and returned&#xD;
to Charlotte's side.&#xD;
"What is this?  Why are you so pale?"   He gave her his&#xD;
hand; but, rising up, she tottered to the window. " Charlotte,&#xD;
what can I do for you?"&#xD;
"Take me home - let me see no one-say that I am ill.&#xD;
When I am calm, I will tell you. Be my friend -until then ! "&#xD;
"Till then - and forever ! " exclaimed Hector.- "Trust in me ;&#xD;
lean upon my arm; and the world shall wrench my life out, be-&#xD;
fore I will let you go. . Sit here till I come back. Courage, dear&#xD;
heart, courage!"&#xD;
She made haste to find her things and put them on; and by&#xD;
the time he returned, she was ready to accompany him. They&#xD;
went out together unobserved. His buggy was at the door ; he&#xD;
helped her in; then, seated by his side, with the darkness of the&#xD;
road before them, the lighted windows behind, and the silence and&#xD;
the starlight all around, the excitement which had nerved her&#xD;
flight subsided, and she sank helpless as an infant on his arm.&#xD;
At length, putting his arm gently away : "How inconsistent I&#xD;
must appear to you ! Still you have patience with me ! "&#xD;
"Patience, Charlotte? For weeks I have studied you with&#xD;
jealous eyes: If ever soul read goul, mine has read yours, - and&#xD;
I am satisfied. I wronged you once, as I told you. You had&#xD;
slandered- yourself in my ear; and it was my fortune to hear an&#xD;
evil report, that I construed into an interpretation of what re-&#xD;

136                   THE WEDDING.&#xD;
mained unexplained in your words. I will not repeat what was&#xD;
told me; I am ashamed to. confess the source from which it came ;&#xD;
but, Charlotte, it was by the very strength of my interest in&#xD;
you that I became so weak."&#xD;
" Perhaps you were not weak - perhaps you saw me better&#xD;
then than you do now."&#xD;
"Stop !" said Hector. " No more self-slander. I. know you,&#xD;
Charlotte. By treating you harshly,- by appearing cruel, bitter,&#xD;
disdainful, - I have discovered the depth and sweetness of your&#xD;
nature. What inward conflicts have heaved and torn me, the&#xD;
while ! 0, Charlotte, if you knew ! But no more of this. I see&#xD;
you crushed to-night beneath a burden; let me first take that&#xD;
away, - then we can talk."&#xD;
" Not now -my tongue is numb !-- To-morrow -- "&#xD;
"To-morrow we may have no opportunity.    I expect com-&#xD;
pany."&#xD;
"Company ?"&#xD;
"After I left you in the dressing-room, Robert Greenwich got&#xD;
me by the button, and told me he should try to call to-morrow&#xD;
afternoon : he will probably be with us at tea."&#xD;
Hector went on talking, but Charlotte heard no more. She did&#xD;
not answer when he spoke to her.. At length she repeated, va-&#xD;
cantly, " At tea? - Did you say, to-morrow ?"&#xD;
" Your mind is on some other subject. Let Robert Greenwich&#xD;
go. He is nothing to you or me, to-night."&#xD;
"Did he -did he speak - of me ?"&#xD;
" He apologized again for intruding upon us, and said he hoped.&#xD;
to meet you to-morrow."&#xD;
That she had been recognized by the man she dreaded, Char-&#xD;
lotte could no longer doubt.- She tried to tell Hector all her fear&#xD;
and despair ; but misgivings chilled her heart, and sealed-her lips,&#xD;
and sent her to her lonely room, that night, with the heavy secret&#xD;
of her life still pent up in her soul.&#xD;
&#xD;
XIII.&#xD;
THE VISIT AND THE EXCURSION.&#xD;
THE next morning, Abimelech Jackwood the younger made&#xD;
an early call at Mr. Dunbury's house. He found the family at&#xD;
breakfast.&#xD;
"Good-morning, sir ! " cried Hector. " Corny, give the young&#xD;
gentleman a seat."&#xD;
"Can't stop!" said Bim, standing bashfully in the door. "I&#xD;
come over to see - git out, Rover ! -if Charlotte don't wanter&#xD;
go up on the hill to-day, with Pheeb."&#xD;
A gleam of hope shone upon Charlotte's heart.&#xD;
" To see Bertha Wing?"&#xD;
"Yes, I believe so. - Here, Rove ! lay down !  Pheeb 's ben&#xD;
lottin' on an all-day visit up there, 's ever s' long, and she said you&#xD;
'greed to go with her."&#xD;
"But you are so poorly this morning, Charlotte !" said Mrs.&#xD;
Dunbury. " Conscientiously as you have endeavored to eat, you&#xD;
have scarce tasted a morsel."&#xD;
Hector: " And we are to have company, you remember."&#xD;
"But I," said Charlotte, quickly, - "I would prefer not to&#xD;
meet strangers. I would enjoy the ride, and a quiet visit with&#xD;
Phoebe and Bertha--"&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury : " Do as you please, then."&#xD;
Charlotte glanced at Hector. His countenance was overcast,&#xD;
but he raised no further objection to the plan; and accordingly&#xD;
word was sent back that she would accompany Phoebe.&#xD;
Miss Jackwood made her appearance in the one-horse wagon,&#xD;
at about nine o'clock. She drove old Dan, -quite a conserva-&#xD;
tive and phlegmatic nag, --whom she found it necessary continu-&#xD;
12*&#xD;

138          THE VISIT AND THE EXCURSION.&#xD;
ally to urge forward, by means of a little, stumpy whip. Arrived&#xD;
within speaking distance of Mr. Dunbury's gate, the sober animal&#xD;
came to a dead halt. " Go 'long,! " ejaculated .Phoebe.&#xD;
Dan did not stir. Mortified at the awkwardness of the circum-&#xD;
stance, occurring at a moment when she so much desired to make&#xD;
a smart appearance, she wielded the whip vigorously.&#xD;
The first blow fell short; the second raised a dust on the&#xD;
horse's rump, and the third made him whisk his tail a little.&#xD;
After that, she bent forward, and laid on and -spared not, until,&#xD;
starting on with a groan, he stopped before the gate.&#xD;
The delay had given Charlotte time to put on her bonnet, and&#xD;
she now came out, ready for the ride.&#xD;
"I was afraid you would n't go," said Phoebe; " but I was&#xD;
feeling so vexed about the wedding, last night, I meant to make a&#xD;
visit somewhere, to-day, any way. Bim said you expected com-&#xD;
pany. Who 's coming ?"&#xD;
" Mr. Greenwich, I think."&#xD;
"Not Robert ?  Has he got home ? I should think you 'd like&#xD;
to stay! I-'11 stay with you, and make you a visit, to-day, if you&#xD;
want me to. Or, I '11 tell you what ! have Robert and Hector&#xD;
come up and take tea with us !-- You tell 'em, Mrs. Dunbury !&#xD;
I bet they will! Won't it be grand?"&#xD;
How pale Charlotte looked!&#xD;
"Don't forget, Mrs. Dunbury ! - Go 'long, ol' Dan!- I 'm&#xD;
ashamed of my driving ! The calves chawed the whip to pieces,&#xD;
t' other night, and this is all there is left of it ; and Dan 's the&#xD;
laziest horse.! - Come, do step !  If Mr. and Mrs. Charles Cres-&#xD;
fon git invited to my wedding, I guess they 'll know it! I'll let&#xD;
'em understand one thing - I don't care if I was n't asked : it&#xD;
han't hurt me a bit; for I don't consider it anything worth mind-&#xD;
ing at all!I"&#xD;
Phoebe seemed so desirous of enforcing this fact upon her com-&#xD;
panion's mind, that she never ceased to chatter about it, until&#xD;
they had made the ascent of the hill, and arrived at Mr. Wing's&#xD;
house. Chlarlotte liked that topic as well as any ; all she wished&#xD;
was, that Phoebe should do the talking, and leave her to her own&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE VISIT AND THE EXCURSION.             189&#xD;
Bertha received her visitors cordially; grandmother Wing&#xD;
joining to give them a hearty welcome.&#xD;
"Why, how you have altered ! " said the old lady, with smil-&#xD;
ing good-nature, to Charlotte. " You've smarted up amazin', I&#xD;
do declare ! I knowed 't was in ye to do it, when I spoke for&#xD;
you to Hector; but, re'ly, I 'm the least mite took back to see you&#xD;
lookin' so very nice an' handsome !"&#xD;
Phoebe had brought her knitting ; Charlotte had some sewing ;&#xD;
and all settled quietly down, to work, and talk, and visit, until&#xD;
near dinner-time, when Bertha went out to assist the kitchen-girl,&#xD;
and to give the finishing touch to the table.&#xD;
Just as they were sitting down to the noon-day meal, Mr.&#xD;
Rukely called, and sat down with them. Mr. Wing was also&#xD;
present, -a man of solemn aspect and stiff opinions, of whom&#xD;
Bertha stood very much in awe.&#xD;
The dinner was a prim and formal affair ; everybody silent or&#xD;
restrained, as was to be expected; only the old lady indulging in&#xD;
a little geniality, while Phoebe now and then burst forth, with&#xD;
some refreshingly spontaneous' remark.&#xD;
"0 dear ! " exclaimed the young girl, after dinner, "I'm so&#xD;
tired of behaving well! Do le's have some fun! Mr. Rukely&#xD;
will excuse us."&#xD;
Mr. Rukely, turning over the leaves of an annual: " 0, cer-&#xD;
tainly."&#xD;
Bertha: " What do you want to do?"&#xD;
Phoebe, throwing down her knitting: " I don't care what ; but&#xD;
I shall die if I don't do something ! Come, le's make cheeses ! "&#xD;
Bertha, blushing and shaking her head: "'Sh ! Not before&#xD;
him !"&#xD;
Charlotte: "If we take a walk, perhaps Mr. Rukely will ac-&#xD;
company us."&#xD;
Mr. Rukely: "With pleasure."&#xD;
Phoebe: " Hurra ! "&#xD;
Bertha: " We '11 want our bonnets, girls."&#xD;
Phoe: "I 'm glad you spoke, for I don't know half what I&#xD;
am about ! May we be wild, Mr. Rukely ?"&#xD;
Mr. Rukely, indulgently: " As wild as you please."&#xD;

140         THE VISIT AND THE EXCURSION.&#xD;
Phoebe : " That 's good ! When we get out of sight and hear-&#xD;
ing once, if I don't scream ! Which way are you going?"&#xD;
Mr. Rukely: "Shall we take the road?"&#xD;
Charlotte: " The woods will be pleasanter; the road is too&#xD;
tame."&#xD;
Phoebe: "0, yes ! we can chase and romp in the woods, and&#xD;
have such a slick time! Mr. Rukely will let down the bars for&#xD;
us. What do you say, Bertha?"&#xD;
Bertha: " Any way will suit me. Only don't be too rude,"--&#xD;
aside to Phobe, -" for I don't know just what he will think."&#xD;
Phoebe, recklessly : "Come on! I '11 be cap'n! How good it&#xD;
feels ou' doors! I want to fly! Let's go 'way off on the moun-&#xD;
tain, and look down towards our house. I wish Hector and Rob&#xD;
Greenwich was here ! don't you, girls ? If we had a spying-glass&#xD;
we might see 'em! It 's so mean I wan't invited to the wedding!&#xD;
but I'm glad of it ! Don't let 's go through the briers."&#xD;
Bertha: "There 's a path somewhere.  0, here it is ! 'T will&#xD;
take us right to the cedar woods."&#xD;
Phoebe ran on before, talking gayly. Suddenly she flew back,&#xD;
with terrified cries.&#xD;
Bertha: "Why, what - what is it?"&#xD;
Phoebe, shudderingly : "Ugl-h-h-h,! A gr-e-a-t bi-i-ig sna-a-&#xD;
ake !"S&#xD;
Mr. Rukely, smiling: "You should learn to overcome the&#xD;
serpent."  Taking up a stick: "Where is he?"&#xD;
Phoebe : "It was crawling off from the log. I should think it&#xD;
was forty or fifty feet long !"&#xD;
Bertha: " Don't go near it !"S&#xD;
Mr. Rukely : " The serpent is the only living thing I feel in&#xD;
duty bound to hate, abhor, and kill ! "&#xD;
He advanced resolutely. Charlotte' turned and looked off on&#xD;
the mountain side. Bertha watched her lover tremblingly, while&#xD;
Phoebe stood ready to run and scream.&#xD;
Mr. Rukely- paused, lowering his stick; the sternness of his&#xD;
features relaxed into a somewhat pallid smile, and he called his&#xD;
companions to advance.&#xD;
Phoebe: " Is it gone ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE VISIT ' AND THE EXCURSION.            141&#xD;
Bertha: "Have you killed it ?"&#xD;
Mr. Rukely lifted something withhis stick. Bertha and Phoebe&#xD;
shrieked simultaneously. Charlotte still looked away.&#xD;
Mr. Rukely: "I did not know before that log-chains were so&#xD;
formidable!" He dropped the clinking links upon the ground.&#xD;
Bertha drew a long breath, and tried to laugh.&#xD;
Phoebe, excited: "But there was a snake; I declare I saw&#xD;
one! -I'm as sure it moved as I am that I stand here ?  0,&#xD;
dear !" she added, as the party proceeded further into the woods,&#xD;
" what did we come in here for ?  These cedars are such hateful&#xD;
things ! "&#xD;
Charlotte: "I think they are beautiful. I love the gloom."&#xD;
Bertha: " I hope you don't love the mosquitos ! I am eaten&#xD;
up by them ! "&#xD;
Mr. Rukely : " It seems to me we are going into a swamp.&#xD;
The air is close and sultry. Shall we turn about?"&#xD;
Bertha : " There 's an ox-path, somewhere, that branches off&#xD;
towards the fields. I believe this is it, though'it looks dreadfully&#xD;
wild and lonely !"&#xD;
Phoebe : " It seems like Sunday, in here ! Let 's get out of it !&#xD;
Mercy ! how I am bitten! 0, what noise was thatI? Seeing&#xD;
that horrid snake makes me nervous as I can be! Every stick is&#xD;
a snake, now ; and I have heard a dozen wild-cats since we came&#xD;
in here. You go ahead, Mr. Rukely. We '11 follow, if it is to&#xD;
the jumping-off place ! "&#xD;
The party came out upon a high pasture-land. Further on was&#xD;
a deep gulf, defended by impenetrable thick growths of bristling&#xD;
poplars and young spruces, and overhung by a precipitous crag.&#xD;
Phoebe: " Hurra for a climb, I say ! We can see all over&#xD;
creation from up there. Who 'll be at the top first ?"&#xD;
Mr. Rukely and Bertha recoiled from the enterprise; but Char-&#xD;
lotte, eager to lose herself in any excitement, seconded Phoebe,&#xD;
and the party made the ascent of the crag.&#xD;
Bertha :'" All this part of the mountain was overrun by fire, a&#xD;
few years ago. These rocks were singed, as if for our especial&#xD;
benefit. Look off in the valley now."-&#xD;
Charlotte : " Wonderful! "&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8115-00000072"/>&#xD;
142          THE VISIT AND THE EXCURSION.&#xD;
Phoebe : " I can see our house ; and there 's ,Bim driving the&#xD;
cows to water ! They look like so many black ants, and he like a&#xD;
little red one!"&#xD;
Mr. Rukely : " The season has been so dry that the country has&#xD;
lost half its beauty. How dead the forests down there appear !&#xD;
Besides, there is too much smoke in the air to-day."&#xD;
Charlotte : "The smoke has a beauty of its own. It gives&#xD;
such a soft blue tint to everything! How still and sweet the valley&#xD;
lies, in the dim sunshine ! The smoke is the soul of the landscape&#xD;
to-day."&#xD;
Bertha: "What a ghastly sky ! The sun is blood-red. Was&#xD;
that thunder?"&#xD;
Mr. Rukely: "I see no clouds. Perhaps the money-diggers&#xD;
are blasting again on the Eagle Rocks."&#xD;
Phoebe: " I thought I saw Rob Greenwich and Hector; but it&#xD;
is only a couple of horses fighting flies by the fence. Let 's roll&#xD;
down rocks. Here goes one ! "  The missile dropped from ledge&#xD;
to ledge, and leaped among the crackling thickets below. "Did&#xD;
you hear it?  0, Mr. Rukely, help me tumble off this big one !&#xD;
Where 's a pry-? " picking up a charred sapling. " There, I've&#xD;
got my hands all black ! Never mind. Give me a lift ! "&#xD;
Mr. Rukely condescended, and a minute later the loosened rock,&#xD;
toppling on the verge of the cliff, turned lazily at first, then rolled,&#xD;
then bounded, then thundered and plunged, snapping and tram-&#xD;
pling the brittle poplars, until the noise of its crashing died away&#xD;
in the depths of the gulf.&#xD;
There was something startling in this invasion of Nature's&#xD;
solitudes with violence and unusual sounds. Phoebe, excited by&#xD;
the sport, detained Mr. Rukely, to set off another flying rock,&#xD;
while Charlotte and Bertha found an easy place of descent, and&#xD;
went down from the crag.&#xD;
" I hear the trickling of water," said Charlotte; "but we can&#xD;
neither reach it nor see it, for the thickets. I am thirsty, 'and my&#xD;
forehead and hands are parching."&#xD;
"The gulf opens below here," replied Bertha, "and a brook&#xD;
runs out io the maple grove, down yonder. Hark!. There goes&#xD;
another stone !"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE VISIT ANDflTHE EXCURSION.-           148&#xD;
" Happy Phoebe ! see her clap her hands, on the ledge!!"&#xD;
"But, while she laughs, you only sigh, Charlotte. And I sym-&#xD;
pathize most with you. How I have wanted to be your friend,&#xD;
and to have you mine ! Let us go down into the ravine, here, and&#xD;
be true and free with each other once."&#xD;
"They are coming! "&#xD;
" We will hide away from them. 0, see where the brook drips&#xD;
.   over the rocks! How cool it is down there ! If we can get&#xD;
through the bushes -"&#xD;
We can," said Charlotte. "Here is an opening."&#xD;
"You will fall!" cried Bertha. "Let me hold your hand&#xD;
until you get your foot firmly upon the rock. I 've torn my&#xD;
dress; but we are through the worst of it now. What delicious&#xD;
beds of moss ! The brook is almost dry, and we can go down&#xD;
these rocky steps until we come to the grove."&#xD;
" Let us sit here, and rest, and bathe our foreheads," replied&#xD;
Charlotte.&#xD;
"Let me bathe yours for you! But it is not bathing that will&#xD;
cure the pain. There is a fever which only tears can cool. I&#xD;
know from experience."&#xD;
"You, Bertha?   You, so fortunate and happy ! "&#xD;
"0O, Charlotte, you do not4 know me ! Fortunate and happy-&#xD;
with this weak, inconsistent heart of mine ! Dear, dear, dear ! "&#xD;
Hark ! Phoebe is calling us," said Charlotte.&#xD;
"Do not answer. It is a relief to get away from them for a&#xD;
little while. I want to talk with, you."&#xD;
"My head, feels better. How kind you are, Bertha ! There is&#xD;
.a a magnetism in your hand, that-removes the pain."&#xD;
" It is your tears," said Bertha. " 0, if I could be your&#xD;
friend ! "&#xD;
"Bertha, good Bertha --I have not a friend in this wide, wide&#xD;
world ! I know not one, not one whom I can trust."&#xD;
" Not even me ! " said Bertha.&#xD;
Her sympathy wrought powerfully upon Charlotte, who opened&#xD;
her heart to her more and more, and appeared almost ready to&#xD;
pour out to her the whole history of her life,&#xD;
Mr. Rukely, from above : " You are pretty truants! We have&#xD;
called and hunted for you everywhere. It is going td rain."&#xD;

144          THE VISIT AND THE EXCURSION.&#xD;
Bertha : "Will you share our shelter with us?"&#xD;
Phoebe : " 0 le's ! I want to wash the crock off my hands."&#xD;
Mr. Rukely : "You are responsible if we get wet."&#xD;
Bertha: " We can go down through the maple grove, then&#xD;
return home by the lower pasture, and avoid the swamp."&#xD;
Phoebe: " And the mosquitos and snakes!. So le's ! "&#xD;
" Another time," whispered Bertha, pressing Charlotte's hand.&#xD;
The party descended through the ravine, stepping upon decayed&#xD;
logs, mossy banks and stones, and rocks encrusted with dry slime.&#xD;
At length the bushes and saplings gave place to the tall trunks of&#xD;
maples and beeches, and, in a convenient spot, they climbed up into&#xD;
the grove.&#xD;
"Why, how dark it is ! " cried Phoebe. " 0, come here ! see&#xD;
through the trees ! What a frightful cloud ! Don't it look awful&#xD;
through the smoke! I'm glad I an't a Millerite ! Did you hear&#xD;
that gun?"&#xD;
Mr. Rukely : " There 's somebody hunting, just over the hill."&#xD;
Phoebe: " I should n't wonder if 't was Robert and Hector.&#xD;
Wait, while I screech!"&#xD;
Charlotte, eagerly: "Don't, don't, Phoebe ! Keep still!"&#xD;
" Why?"&#xD;
"Because, we 'll spoil their sport. Besides, I - I don't think&#xD;
it can be Hector. He never shoots."&#xD;
" He used to, and I bet he would n't object, if Rob Greenwich&#xD;
should coax him! Rob used to be crazy about hunting, and the&#xD;
squirrels are thick now."/&#xD;
Bertha : " It will do no harm to shout."&#xD;
"No, no, Bertha! Let us go back. The darkness frightens&#xD;
me." And Charlotte set out to fly from the grove.&#xD;
Phoebe: "Here ! where are you going?  That an't the way."&#xD;
"Tell me, then. Let us hasten ! The storm will be upon us ! "&#xD;
Mr. Rukely: '"We shall get wet, most certainly. What is&#xD;
that?  A shantee ?"&#xD;
Bertha: "lIt is a shelter for the men when they work in the&#xD;
sugar-bush. There 's the great trough, and the arch for boiling.&#xD;
Shall we go in and wait till the shower passes?"&#xD;
The proposition was favorably received by all except Charlotte.&#xD;
&#xD;
rA&#xD;
&#xD;
THE VISIT AND THE EXCURSION.              145&#xD;
She would have hastened from the woods. But already the big&#xD;
rain-drops began to fall, rattling and hissing among the leaves.&#xD;
Phoebe ran screaming to the shantee, swinging her bonnet in her&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
" Come, Charlotte," said Bertha. "Why are you afraid ? The&#xD;
shower will soon pass; then we will go home together."&#xD;
" Well, as you please."&#xD;
"I know now what troubles you, Charlotte. It is what I&#xD;
feared for you. It was almost inevitable. Everybody loves him."&#xD;
"What do you mean?"&#xD;
"His voice, his manner, the clear splendor of his face," said&#xD;
Bertha, with a swelling heart; "everything about him fasci-&#xD;
nates ! I pity you!"&#xD;
"I do not understand - you are speaking of -"&#xD;
" Hector ! "&#xD;
"From your own experience ? " said Charlotte, with feverish&#xD;
interest.&#xD;
"0, no, -not much ! I have known him all my life. I do&#xD;
not think he is a flirt, but he is peculiar ; he loves to exert his&#xD;
power, and it is his way to say, and do, and look, the most win-&#xD;
ning things, without really meaning them. That 's the danger.&#xD;
Then, he is so fitful ! He keeps one always in suspense. Let me&#xD;
warn you in season."&#xD;
" There is no need. He is nothing to me, nor ever can be,&#xD;
Bertha. But I thank you for your kind advice, the same."&#xD;
" There was another gun," cried Bertha, "nearer than before !&#xD;
Let us run. See ! Mr. Rukely and Phoebe are already in the&#xD;
cabin."&#xD;
Charlotte glanced wildly in the direction of the report. At&#xD;
that moment a sudden lightning-flash filled all the woods with an&#xD;
instantaneous fearful glare, and the bursting thunder followed,&#xD;
crashing down the sky, and tumbling from height to height along&#xD;
the mountain range.&#xD;

XIV.&#xD;
THE HUNTERS.&#xD;
TREMBLING and breathless, Charlotte, following her companions,&#xD;
reached the shelter just as the descending rain began to rush and&#xD;
rattle among the trees.&#xD;
"Stand here," cried Phoebe, "and look out when it lightens !&#xD;
How wild and dark the woods are ! I'm about three quarters&#xD;
scart!"&#xD;
Mr. Rukely: "Here are plenty of sap-buckets to sit down upon,&#xD;
if you like. Be careful - the roof slants."&#xD;
Phoebe : " I give my head an awful tunk, in there.! Then I&#xD;
walked backwards and set down in that big iron kittle. I guess&#xD;
my dress will look pretty! Did n't you hear me yell?"&#xD;
Charlotte: "I'm afraid of scorpions."&#xD;
Bertha : " Who ever heard of such a thing ?"&#xD;
Phoebe: "O-o-o ! did you see that flash ?  There come the&#xD;
hunters !. It 's Hector and Robert, just as I told you. They 've&#xD;
got a lot of squirrels ! "&#xD;
" 0, Bertha !" whispered Charlotte, "tell me what to do ! I&#xD;
cannot meet them ! Why did I come in here ?"&#xD;
" Shall I conceal you?"&#xD;
"0, can you?"&#xD;
"Get back into the corner. I will sit before you."&#xD;
" No, I will not be so weak ! It must come, -I will meet it&#xD;
now!"&#xD;
The shantee was dark ; and Hector and Robert, entering, did&#xD;
not readily recognize the inmates.&#xD;
Robert, pulling somebody's bonnet front, her face : "This is&#xD;
Phoebe Jackwood.   I knew your scream when we were over&#xD;
&#xD;
THE HUNTERS.                    147&#xD;
the hill. Hello ! if you bite, you shall have your teeth taken&#xD;
out."&#xD;
"You shan't kiss me, Rob Greenwich ! If you do --"&#xD;
"I was n't going to. But I see you'll be disappointed, now, if&#xD;
I don't!"&#xD;
" Hector! Hector ! help !"&#xD;
Hector : "Fight your own battles. Who is here ? Bertha and&#xD;
Charlotte ! This is an unlooked-for good fortune."&#xD;
Mr. Rukely : " You have met with eminent success gunning, I&#xD;
see. You should be proud of those trophies."&#xD;
Hector threw down his game. "0, to be sure! How glorious&#xD;
are the faculties of man ! What divine recreations enchant us !&#xD;
Proud ?- I am as proud as poor Tray was, when whipped for&#xD;
keeping bad company."&#xD;
Robert: " I am the bad company, I suppose. I led poor Tray&#xD;
into wickedness. But, once in, he beat me at my own game. He&#xD;
is two squirrels my superior in cruelty."&#xD;
Hector : " I did not think that I should ever again take delight&#xD;
in shooting these pretty fan-tails. I had learned to love them in&#xD;
my rambles.  They run up the great trunks; they jump from&#xD;
branch to branch ; they chatter ; they curve their fine tails; they&#xD;
sit and nibble nuts on the high limbs. Is there nothing to win&#xD;
us in all that ? Up goes the deadly gun, and this wonderful slen-&#xD;
der casket, which holds the divine secret of existence, instinct, hap-&#xD;
piness, falls broken at your feet. There it is ; look at it ! It is&#xD;
in form the same as ever, but all the ingenuity of- murderous man&#xD;
cannot restore the plundered jewel."&#xD;
Robert : "0, brave and-eloquent harangue!"&#xD;
Hector turned over his game : ' Two, four, six,--I killed&#xD;
them all!  It is a trifle, perhaps; but such a trifle teaches me&#xD;
that I am no more proof-against temptation, than powder is proof&#xD;
against fire ; that I am made of the very same stuff with thieves,&#xD;
robbers, and all sorts of ill-doers ; and that only circumstance and&#xD;
provocation have been wanting to develop me into as complete a&#xD;
villain as the world knows."&#xD;
" And what of all this ?"&#xD;
"What of all this? Charity, sir, charity ! Give me your&#xD;

hand, Robert. I can grasp it more heartily than I have been&#xD;
able to do of late, Is there another chief of sinners present'? I&#xD;
will embrace. him !"&#xD;
" I declare, Hector Dunbury !" exclaimed Phoebe, " one would&#xD;
think you was crazy ! "&#xD;
" You may think so; but Bertha does not, and Charlotte does&#xD;
not ! Excuse me, Robert. I should have introduced you to our&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
And, with affected formality, Hector went through with the&#xD;
neglected ceremony. Robert bowed with easy politeness. Pale&#xD;
and cold, but outwardly composed, Charlotte acknowledged the&#xD;
salutation.&#xD;
" This is a romantic spot to make an acquaintance," said he ;&#xD;
"but we might have met under stranger circumstances ; so let us&#xD;
not stand upon etiquette, but be friends at once. Shall I occupy&#xD;
this bucket by your side?"&#xD;
Holding her heart with all her might, Charlotte bowed again ;&#xD;
and Robert sat down.&#xD;
t Do not be alarmed," said he, in a significant tone. "Hector&#xD;
insinuates that I am quite a formidable sinner; but we all know&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"No, you don't !" cried Hector. "And you never will, Robert&#xD;
Greenwich, until we some day quarrel royally, and thenceforward&#xD;
stand to each other for precisely what we are."&#xD;
" Quarrel ! you and 1? 0, Damon and Pythias ! " said Robert,&#xD;
" what do you mean ? "&#xD;
Hector turned to Mr. Rukely. "Explain, if you can, my rela-&#xD;
tion to that good-natured Beelzebub."&#xD;
Robert, gayly : "This is his peculiar style of joking. He is&#xD;
marvellously funny, if you but understand him. 'Beelzebub' is&#xD;
good !"&#xD;
"I have no sympathy whatever with his polities, religion, or&#xD;
morals;, our spirits are entirely antagonistic ; still he holds me,.&#xD;
or I him, by a power I cannot comprehend."&#xD;
Robert laughed immoderately.&#xD;
" The truth is this: I was with him in days of temptation ; I&#xD;
watched over him with a shepherd's care, and brought him every&#xD;

night, like a tender lamb, into the fold of virtue, Hence the&#xD;
tie between us."&#xD;
And he turned aside to Charlotte.&#xD;
" What is he whispering to you ?" demanded Hector.&#xD;
Robert laid his fingers upon Charlotte's arm. "Keep my secret,&#xD;
and I will keep yours !"  ,&#xD;
Charlotte, with an effort: "You see, my lips are sealed."&#xD;
Hector regarded her with a questioning look, and turned his&#xD;
head slowly away.&#xD;
Robert laughed again. " That 's another of his jokes, -in his&#xD;
best style! What a glance that was; as much as to say, 'I have&#xD;
warned you; look out for him."'&#xD;
Phoebe, impatiently : " Come, do say something sensible ! I&#xD;
am sure I 'can't see any fun in such talk. It don't rain now ;&#xD;
le's go out."&#xD;
Mr. Rukely :. "The storm has passed around to the north."&#xD;
Robert smiled significantly, bending slightly towards Charlotte.&#xD;
"It has been the way of storms, this season, I am told. They&#xD;
have a northerly tendency ; they are attracted by the higher lati-&#xD;
tudes. Don't you think the Green Mountains delightful, Miss&#xD;
Woods ?"&#xD;
Charlotte's features contracted ; she bit her lip, shrinking invol-&#xD;
untarily from her tormentor. His keen eye watched her face, while&#xD;
his tongue repeated the question.&#xD;
" I might think so, if it were not for the snakes !" she answered,&#xD;
in a low tone.&#xD;
Robert, with an unconscious air : "But our Vermont snakes&#xD;
are quite harmless, if you treat them well."&#xD;
Bertha : " Harmless as log-chains, Phoebe !  Come, the sky is&#xD;
brightening; shall we go ? Hector and Robert are expected to&#xD;
be of our party, and take tea with us."&#xD;
Hector : " We have our squirrels and guns to carry."&#xD;
Mr. Rukely : " You can send them home in Phoebe's wagon."&#xD;
Robert: "That will be capital ! Shall I have the pleasure of&#xD;
your company, Miss Woods?"&#xD;
.Phobe, elated: "lIt all happens just right ! Le' me carry a&#xD;

150                   THE   UNUTERs.&#xD;
Hector: "You'11 be shooting some one.   If you have any&#xD;
regard for human life, Robert, keep your rifle in your hand."&#xD;
Robert, carelessly : "I '11 risk her. Here, my young Amazon,&#xD;
my aspiring Diana ! carry your weapon thus. Shoot whom you&#xD;
please, but do not point the muzzle at me. Hector and Miss Wing'&#xD;
will lead the way."&#xD;
Hector, consented reluctantly, and went forward with Bertha.&#xD;
Then followed Mr. Rukely and Phoebe. Robert walked behind,&#xD;
keeping close to Charlotte's side.&#xD;
"How little did I expect this happiness! My life! what good&#xD;
fortune has brought us again together ?"&#xD;
Charlotte trembled; but there was something besides fear in&#xD;
the restless down-glance of her eye, and the quivering curve of&#xD;
her lip.:&#xD;
"You were wrong to deceive me as you did," said Robert. "It&#xD;
was like a death-blow, when I lost you. For I had been disinter-&#xD;
ested and true ; I was your best friend ; I did not merit such&#xD;
ingratitude."&#xD;
Charlotte turned upon her companion a look of acutest pain.&#xD;
She opened her lips to speak.&#xD;
"Not that I blamed you; I did not, in the least," he hastened&#xD;
to say. "You had learned, by bitter experience, to distrust all&#xD;
men. Only I thought you should have known me better. I could&#xD;
not give you up so; I have spent the summer in search of you;&#xD;
I have a length and breadth of enduring love, deep in my nature,&#xD;
which nothing can tire or exhaust. It has centred in you, it&#xD;
holds you, it will not let you go!"&#xD;
Hard and fast breathed Charlotte. She pressed her hand upon&#xD;
her heart. At length, with forced calmness, she spoke.&#xD;
" It is useless to remind me that I am in your power. I know&#xD;
it. But I do not care much now, - I am ready to meet any&#xD;
shame or disaster. I once thought you noble and generous -"&#xD;
"But you fled from me !"&#xD;
" And I would have fled again and again; but when I saw you.I&#xD;
last night, a dead despair fell on me. Something has held me. I&#xD;
seem to have been brought here to-day only to meet you!"&#xD;
"Your better angel overrules your will !"'&#xD;
&#xD;
2&#xD;

THE HUNTERS.                    151&#xD;
" Call it what you please," replied Charlotte, in bitter anguish.&#xD;
"I am in your power. I expect no mercy at your hands !"&#xD;
"Be calm; listen to reason. When I swore to be your friend&#xD;
and protector, I took an oath that I shall keep. All I ask is,&#xD;
that you will consent to see me again, hear my explanation, and&#xD;
try to know me better. I dare not talk now.  Hector is suspi-&#xD;
cious. Promise me that, and you are safe."&#xD;
Charlotte was about to reply, when the sharp report of'$a rifle&#xD;
rang through the woods, and some person was seen to fall forward&#xD;
upon the ground.&#xD;
"It is Mr. Rukely ! " cried Robert. "Phoebe has shot him ! "&#xD;
Phoebe stood petrified with consternation. Bertha screamed&#xD;
faintly, and-.ran to lift her lover up. Hector and Robert reached&#xD;
the spot simultaneously. But Mr. Rukely was too quick for&#xD;
them all.&#xD;
"That was awfully careless, Phoebe ! " he exclaimed, looking&#xD;
very pale and severe.&#xD;
"I,-hoo -boo-was only seeing if there was a cap on!"&#xD;
stammered Phoebe.&#xD;
"I heard the lock click," said Mr. Rukely, "and looked to see&#xD;
what the child was doing, when, providentially, I tripped my foot,&#xD;
If I had not stumbled just as I did, I should certainly have been&#xD;
shot through the head. It was a wonderful preservation."&#xD;
" How could you, Phoebe !" said Bertha.&#xD;
"You have wasted a charge of powder for me ! " exclaimed&#xD;
Robert.&#xD;
Mr. Rukely, magnanimously : " I forgive her ! "&#xD;
Phoebe, weeping : "I only just pulled up that thing a little,&#xD;
-I thought there was n't any cap on, - and my finger slipped&#xD;
off - "&#xD;
Mr. Rukely: "Well, well, there 's no harm done. Be more&#xD;
careful in future."&#xD;
Hector flung a sharp reprimand at Robert, for trusting Phoebe&#xD;
with the gun.&#xD;
"Very good !"'laughed the latter. "How many of you heard&#xD;
the bullet ?"&#xD;
Bertha had heard the whistle ; so had Hector. On reflection,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8115-00000077"/>&#xD;
152                   THE HUNTER$.&#xD;
everybody had heard it whistle and cut the leaves, except Mr.&#xD;
Rukely and Phoebe.&#xD;
"Now, the joke'of the thing is," said Robert, "there was no&#xD;
bullet in the gun ! So much for imagination ! "&#xD;
This avowal failed to give general satisfaction, although he was&#xD;
ready to swear to it, and went so far as to explain how it hap-&#xD;
pened that, on the coming up of the shower, he had rammed down&#xD;
a hard wad, in place of a ball. Phoebe's conscience was comforted&#xD;
a good deal, and she declared that she was sure, if there had been&#xD;
a bullet in the gun, she would not have meddled with the lock !&#xD;
So the party proceeded, Charlotte walking the remainder of the&#xD;
way with Mr. Rukely, while Robert chatted with Phoebe.&#xD;
Arrived at the house, a lively excitement prevailed, and there&#xD;
arose a clamor of indignation against Robert, on the discovery&#xD;
that Mr. Rukely's hat had two holes in it : one where a bullet&#xD;
had gone in, and another where it had gone out.&#xD;
" I told you sac" cried Bertha.&#xD;
Mr.-Rukely, with'a grim smile: " I though there was no bullet&#xD;
in the gun, Mr. Greenwich !"&#xD;
Phoebe looked blank. But Robert threw himself upon a chair,&#xD;
,and laughed with open throat, declaring that this last was the&#xD;
best joke of all.&#xD;
"He has no more heart or conscience than a stone," said Hec-&#xD;
tor. " How were you pleased with his, conversation," -to Char-&#xD;
lotte, aside, -=- "as you came through the woods together ?"&#xD;
Charlotte changed color: "Why do you ask?"&#xD;
Hector, regarding her darkly: "Man is a deceiver; woman's&#xD;
heart is soft; and flattery is the snare of souls. Trust not one&#xD;
of us'"&#xD;
&#xD;
xV.&#xD;
THE LIFTING of THE VEIL.&#xD;
THENCEFoRWAD Robert Greenwich frequented Mrs. Dunbury's&#xD;
house with untiring zeal. Hunting, fishing, or riding, he was&#xD;
never without some pleasant excuse for resorting that way. He&#xD;
always inquired for Hector, and feigned disappointment if he did&#xD;
not find him; but it was only when Charlotte was absent that&#xD;
he was ever once known to be in a hurry.&#xD;
One day, calling as usual, he found Charlotte and Hector sit-&#xD;
ting together; both silent; the former busy with her needle, the&#xD;
latter engaged in reading random passages in a volume of Shak-&#xD;
speare.&#xD;
"Under the circumstances," said the visitor, smiling, "I pre-&#xD;
sume you are not very glad to see me."&#xD;
" If you refer to me," replied Hector, "I am not. I never&#xD;
am. But I suppose that makes no difference. Sit down."&#xD;
" Thank you for your frankness. I find it quite refreshing.&#xD;
Don't let me interrupt anything, I pray."&#xD;
"You certainly shall not," -and Hector went on with his&#xD;
reading.&#xD;
Robert smiled as he placed his hat on the table,,and drew his&#xD;
chair to Charlotte's side. For half an hour they conversed in&#xD;
whispers, with long intervals of silence; and at his departure, she&#xD;
accompanied him to the porch, and talked some minutes with him&#xD;
there.&#xD;
Returning then to the sitting-room, and landing Hector's book&#xD;
on the floor, she stooped to take it up. He caught her wrist, and&#xD;
held her back. She looked up. The suppressed passion in his&#xD;
face frightened her.&#xD;
&#xD;

154            THE LIFTING OF THE VEIL.&#xD;
" I thought you had dropped it by accident," she faltered.&#xD;
"I flung it there in a rage ! Therefore leave it for my shame&#xD;
and contrition to take it up again."- He pushed it under the&#xD;
table with his foot. -" Lie there," said he, "until I am once&#xD;
more a man!"&#xD;
All this time he held Charlotte's wrist. Rigid and pale with&#xD;
suffering, she made but a feeble effort to escape.&#xD;
"Are you an angel or a fiend ? " he demanded, searching her&#xD;
face with his determined eye.&#xD;
"Neither," said she, with tearful pathos; " I am a woman."&#xD;
" True ; I had forgotten," replied Hector. "That name ac-&#xD;
counts for every inconsistency that entangles our poor human&#xD;
nature! A woman!-Go !"&#xD;
lie dropped her hand. The look he gave her carried a more&#xD;
terrible meaning than his words. He took a number of quick&#xD;
strides across the room; then came and looked upon her. She&#xD;
had not yet spoken; she had sunk down by a chair ; her silence&#xD;
and meekness under the blow he had struck burned into his soul&#xD;
like fire.&#xD;
" Charlotte," said he, after a long pause. He spoke more ten-&#xD;
derly, and she began to weep. "Charlotte -" and he stooped&#xD;
to raise her up.&#xD;
She only bowed more humbly still, until at last her forehead&#xD;
touched his foot.&#xD;
" Well, if that is your place, this is mine ! "&#xD;
And he threw himself prone upon his face at her side.&#xD;
"No, no ! not there ! " she cried, starting quickly up.&#xD;
He caught the hem of her dress to his lips, and kissed it ; but&#xD;
she snatched it from him.&#xD;
" What are you?" she cried out.&#xD;
" 0 God! what am I?" he groaned, burying his face in his&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
" How have I offended you?"&#xD;
"You have not offended me. I have offended myself! 0,&#xD;
what a fine blusterer am I!"&#xD;
" But I have given you some cause - I know I have !"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE LIFTING OF THE VEIL.               155&#xD;
"Have you?    I gather hope from that ! Tell me what  -&#xD;
afford me an excuse for my rage - and unhorse this imp of con-&#xD;
science that rides me! Come, sit here upon this chair, and we&#xD;
will talk."&#xD;
"I have not been open and free with you," Charlotte con-&#xD;
fessed.&#xD;
"True; but what of that?  I have had no claim upon your&#xD;
confidence whatever!"&#xD;
" Indeed, indeed, you have, sir.! No outward claim, perhaps,&#xD;
- and yet a claim -I have felt it, and you have felt it ! "&#xD;
" And so I have ! But I thought that was all my egotism !&#xD;
You recognize it ? 0, Charlotte ! if a desperate and all-controll-&#xD;
ing love can merit anything, I have a claim! Sit still -for&#xD;
now my tongue is loosed, and you must hear me! In spite of&#xD;
myself, in spite of reason and will, I am  drawn irrevocably to&#xD;
you. As you are to me, so is all the world. To doubt you is to&#xD;
doubt humanity. The light of the universe- shines upon me&#xD;
through your eyes ; and if they are turned from me, my soul is&#xD;
dark. Are you frightened, or are you glad, that you tremble so,&#xD;
and hide your face ? "&#xD;
No reply. Hector went on.&#xD;
" I thought - I believed -- I knew - that I was to you all&#xD;
that you were to me. So, I had a claim. And after a long strug-&#xD;
gle within myself, there came a period of calm and peace. My&#xD;
soul opened its doors to you. But, just then, Robert Green-&#xD;
wich appeared. He cast his shadow between us; and the doors&#xD;
were clashed together as by a whirlwind. Had he been worthy,&#xD;
could I have seen that you belonged to him by the Divine law,&#xD;
- but you know my feeling of that man! Imagine, then, what a&#xD;
burning was lighted within me, when I saw him, with a cool, auda-&#xD;
cious smile, step in, and gain from you in an hour what is"with-&#xD;
held from me to this day !"&#xD;
"Gain from me - what ?"&#xD;
" That you know, better than I! But I am not blind ; I am&#xD;
not deaf. Would that I were ! Not once has that fine hypocrite&#xD;
gone out of his selfish track for me. All his visits to this house&#xD;
are visits to you. That first day of your meeting in the woods,&#xD;

he insinuated himself into your confidence;. I saw it at the time;&#xD;
since then there have been manifold secrets between you. I have&#xD;
marked his assumption, which you have endured, if not encour-&#xD;
aged. I have marked your blushes, your pallor, your faltering&#xD;
speech, when he has come suddenly upon you, or given you mean-&#xD;
ing looks, or whispered in your ear. With the interest I feel in&#xD;
you, and the scorn I have for him, can you wonder at the fury&#xD;
stirred in my blood?  To-day, the tiger was roused, and would&#xD;
have sprung at his throat.'&#xD;
"I do not wonder; I am to blame!" uttered Charlotte.&#xD;
"0, woman! woman! I loved you, and tried to hate you. I&#xD;
believed you worthy,-and believed you not worthy. To my un-&#xD;
derstanding you appeared false and erring; but ever in my heart&#xD;
you were fair, white-robed, pure, angelic ! 0, how I loved you,&#xD;
when I was most unkind !Charlotte, did I deserve your trust?"&#xD;
"You ,did - you did ! But your friendship was too precious&#xD;
to ne; Ieould not bear to lose it: my fear kept me dumb: so, I&#xD;
left you to misjudge me."&#xD;
"Show me how I misjudged you."&#xD;
"Let me sit by the window; I cannot breathe here," said&#xD;
Charlotte.  " I will tell you everything to-day.  This agony&#xD;
must have an end. I know you will cast me from you-but it&#xD;
will be better so. Be patient; I must collect my thoughts a&#xD;
little."&#xD;
Hector trembled with suspense. He led her to a seat by the&#xD;
window, and, placing himself beside her, took her cold hands in&#xD;
his.&#xD;
" Speak boldly ! " said he, in quivering tones. "If I am true,&#xD;
no misfortune, no fault, no dark spot in the past, can stain you in&#xD;
my sight.- Your soul is what I love. It matters little what gar-&#xD;
ments it has worn, if it be clothed in white to-day. The true&#xD;
man looks through every external circumstance, to the spiritual&#xD;
substance under 'all. Only the weak and ignorant regard birth,&#xD;
fortune, family, reputation -"&#xD;
At that mon.ent, the door opened. Mrs. Dunbury entered,&#xD;
smiling benignly.&#xD;
" Do I intrude? " she asked, hesitating.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ir&#xD;

" You do," said Hector, gently, but with something like a&#xD;
frown. "Leave us alone a few minutes-if you please."&#xD;
"Certainly," replied Mrs. Dunbury. "I am afraid you will&#xD;
take cold by that window, Charlotte. There is quite a chill air&#xD;
to-day."&#xD;
She stooped to take up Hector's book ; he followed her with&#xD;
an impatient eye; when, having turned again, to smile her satis-&#xD;
faction at the aspect of affairs, she deliberately withdrew.&#xD;
Then Hector moved impulsively to the door, and turned the key&#xD;
in the lock.&#xD;

XVI.&#xD;
FIGHTING FIRE.&#xD;
iT was a new thing for Hector to be closeted -with Charlotte.&#xD;
His mother augured favorably from the circumstance, and waited&#xD;
with hopeful interest for the termination of the interview.&#xD;
The hour seemed long: but at length, with a thrill of motherly&#xD;
solicitude, she heard the sitting-room door open, and Hector come&#xD;
forth. He was passing through the hall, when she hastened to&#xD;
intercept him.&#xD;
"Hector'! " -she started with alarm -" are you ill?"&#xD;
There was a desperate trouble in his pale face; 'he did not&#xD;
glance aside, or turn his head, but, putting her off with a feeble&#xD;
gesture, as she followed him, hurried from the house. Excited&#xD;
with fresh fears, Mrs. Dunbury made haste to find Charlotte.&#xD;
She entered the sitting-room. All was still; she saw no one ; but&#xD;
presently a low moan directed her attention to a large arm-chair,&#xD;
before which lay Charlotte like one dead, with her face upon the&#xD;
floor, hidden in the scattered masses of her hair.&#xD;
" My child !_ what is this? "  She lifted her up ; she put back&#xD;
the curls from her temples; she kissed her, and called her endear-&#xD;
ing names. But the poor girl only moaned, and strove to prostrate&#xD;
herself again upon the floor. Then, more than ever alarmed, but&#xD;
fearing more for Hector than for her, Mrs. Dunbury threw on&#xD;
hastily her bonnet and shawl, and walked out in the direction he&#xD;
had been observed to take.&#xD;
It was another 'smoky day. The drouth had continued; Au-,&#xD;
tumn had crept unawares in the dry path of Summer ; the hills&#xD;
were prematurely brown, the forests sere and dead, and the sun&#xD;
looked like blood in the sky.&#xD;
&#xD;
FIGHTING FIRE.                   159&#xD;
A few days before, in the anticipation of~rain, Mr. Dunbury&#xD;
had ventured to set fire to some obstinate stumps on the borders&#xD;
of a swamp, west of the creek. Again, as usual that summer, all&#xD;
signs had failed; the rain came not ; the earth was dried to tin-&#xD;
der; and the fire spread in every direction. The men fought&#xD;
against its inroads, with water and spades; drenched it, quenched&#xD;
it, smothered it in dirt; killed it, cried victory, and left it for&#xD;
dead a dozen times. But it had the blind mole's instinct for dig-&#xD;
ging in the earth. It ate off the roots of trees, and brought them&#xD;
down crashing in the dry swamp. It devoured the soil itself; it&#xD;
ran in the grass like snakes; and was continually watching its&#xD;
opportunity to dodge into the fences, or to insinuate itself into the&#xD;
balsam pump-logs, piled up on the edge of the swamp.&#xD;
It had shown itself again that afternoon, leaping up, flushed&#xD;
and exultant, in a spot where least expected. Its fantastic danc-&#xD;
ing and clapping of hands had of course been speedily checked,&#xD;
and it now lay humbled in dust and ashes;, but columns of smoke,&#xD;
arising from the burnt ground, marked the scene of the conflict.&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury thought she discerned Hector working with'his&#xD;
father, in the midst of the smoke. In her uncertainty, she spoke&#xD;
to Corny, who was filling barrels with water, at the creek.&#xD;
"Yis, that 's him," drawled Corny.  "I d'n' know what we&#xD;
should done without him ; for he beats all creation to work, when&#xD;
he gits a little grain riled."&#xD;
"What do you mean by riled?"&#xD;
"Wal, he was goin' by, when me an' Mist' Danbury was run-&#xD;
nin' to put out the fire ; and Mist' Dunbury told him to go an'&#xD;
help, -kinder cross, I thought, an' I guess he thought so too, for&#xD;
he did n't say nothin'; but the way he put in when he got to the&#xD;
fire was a caution, you may as well believe ! Darned if I could&#xD;
do anything but stan' an' look on !"&#xD;
"Well, fill the barrels;, they will want the water."&#xD;
" IL am fillim' 'em. - There ! what in thunder was I thinkin'&#xD;
on?  They tumbled off 'm the sled, when I turned the hoss&#xD;
'round, and I 'ye been 'n' filled one 'ithout puttin' it on agin !"&#xD;
." Place the other on the sled, and dip the water from this one&#xD;
into it," said Mrs. Dunbury.&#xD;

"Wal, I did n't think o' that. It '11 take a good while, b'sides.&#xD;
If Bridget 'u'd come and help, we could lift it on."&#xD;
At this moment Mr. Dunbury shouted,."1Make haste !"&#xD;
" An't I makin' haste all I kin !" muttered Corny.--" He '11&#xD;
be mad as thunder, now, if he sees me pourin' water from one&#xD;
barrel into t' other."&#xD;
He accordingly exercised his ingenuity in the matter, and&#xD;
turned the horse partly around, to place him as a screen between&#xD;
him and his two, barrels and Mr. Dunbury and his two eyes.&#xD;
After that he emptied barrel number one into barrel number two ;&#xD;
and, discovering that the contents of barrel number one did&#xD;
not much more than half fill barrel number-two, paused to phi-&#xD;
losophize on the subject; when Mrs. Dunbury advanced the&#xD;
hypothesis that there was an outlet somewhere. In fact, barrel&#xD;
number two leaked like a sieve. By this time Mr. Dunbury was&#xD;
shouting again. "Hurry with what you 've got !"&#xD;
" Wa-a-al! I won't fuss no longer," said Corny, taking the&#xD;
reins. " There an't much of it, so I can ride."&#xD;
He jumped upon the sled, and, to save the wasting contents of&#xD;
the barrel, struck the horse with the reins. The animal failed,.&#xD;
however, to keep pace with the leak: while he only walked, the&#xD;
water was running :- and by the time the scene of excitement was&#xD;
reached, barrel number two was empty.&#xD;
" I done jest as ye told me to!" screamed Corny.&#xD;
Out of respect for Mr. Dunbury's length of arm, he dodged&#xD;
behind the barrel, which was overturned between them, and&#xD;
stepped back into a bed of hot ashes, up to his knees.&#xD;
Made aware of her husband's excitement by the united witness&#xD;
of her eyes and ears, but feeling it still more in her wounded&#xD;
spirit, Mrs. Dunbury's heart failed her, and, giving a last anxious&#xD;
look at Hector, as he disappeared in the smoke, she returned&#xD;
slowly tothe house.&#xD;
Ah hour later, Bridget blew the horn, and Mr. Dunbury and&#xD;
Corny came up to supper. They were covered with sweat and&#xD;
soot ; and the brow of the farmer was dark and angry.&#xD;
" Where is Hector ?" asked the invalid, anxiously.&#xD;
" He is in the swamp."&#xD;
&#xD;
lltf.&#xD;
&#xD;
FIGHTING FIRE.                   161&#xD;
" Is n't he coming to supper ?"&#xD;
" It was necessary for some one to watch the fire."&#xD;
" I offered to," said Corny, blacking a towel with his half-&#xD;
washed face, "but he said he 'd stay; so I tho't I 'd let him, if he&#xD;
could see any fun in 't."&#xD;
After supper, Corny was sent to take Hector's place; but he&#xD;
returned, not long after, and made his appearance, whittling,&#xD;
"Where is Hector?" asked Mrs. Dunbury again.&#xD;
"He's out there."&#xD;
" But you were told to watch the fire !"&#xD;
"Wal, he said he 'd watch it. B'sides, the fire 's all under now,&#xD;
and he could leave it 's well as not, if he was a mind to."&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury then went to the garden where her husband&#xD;
was at work, and "expressed to him something of her fears for&#xD;
Hector.  "Would it not be well to speak to him yourself?" she&#xD;
ventured to say.&#xD;
" And go down on my knees to him ? " aded her husband,&#xD;
with a lurid look.&#xD;
"0, no, not that, but you know his spirit; he cannot forget a&#xD;
wrong; an unjust or unworthy word corrodes his very heart."&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury made no reply, but kept on husking the garden&#xD;
corn, and throwing the ears into the basket. His face was red and&#xD;
angry; and, with her knowledge of his moods, she judged it wise&#xD;
to leave him. It was now fast growing dark, and as a last resort&#xD;
she sent Bridget with a message to her son.&#xD;
But the evening dragged on, and still Hector did not appear.&#xD;
Under the wide canopy of smoke that burdened the night air and&#xD;
hid the stars, he satupon a fallen trunk, in the midst of the black&#xD;
field. The subtle element was "under," as Corny had declared ;&#xD;
but, though crushed, it was not killed : angry eyes starting out now&#xD;
and then, and winking redly in the dark, betrayed its lurking&#xD;
life. No other object was visible on any side, far or near, save&#xD;
the darker shadows of the swamp, contrasting dimly with the&#xD;
misty gloom of the fields.&#xD;
There was something deeply solemn in the scene. To Hector,&#xD;
it seemed typical of his own soul,&#xD;
In the night of despair by which he was encompassed, he&#xD;

saw no light, no glimmer anywhere, save in the quivering embers&#xD;
of a deep-burning passion, which he had trampled beneath his&#xD;
feet. Nor was the correspondence destroyed, when, looking to the&#xD;
eastward, he beheld a startling apparition in the sky. It was of&#xD;
two blood-red spectres, flickering and glowing like fragments of&#xD;
the moon in flames. He knew that the phenomenon was caused&#xD;
by fires on- the high mountain-top ; but his distempered fancy,&#xD;
could seeonly two grotesque and awful eyes gazing upon him out&#xD;
of heaven, and symbolizing the still more awful eyes of conscience&#xD;
in his soul.&#xD;
The night wore on. The giant eyes blinked sleepily.. The&#xD;
embers in the ground twinkled, and shifted from place to place,&#xD;
like electric sparks. The leaves rustled in the swamp, the night-&#xD;
wind moaned in the trees. Then came a snapping and crackling&#xD;
of roots, a stir in the air, a murmur and a whisper overhead, fol-&#xD;
lowed by a deep, hoarse whistle, swelling to a roar, and a resound-&#xD;
ing crash in the blind woods. The earth shuddered, and dull&#xD;
echoes smote the hills. A tree had fallen. Still Hector sat and&#xD;
watched ; and now, while his limbs became chilled with the cold,&#xD;
his thoughts grew wild and hideous. He imagined himself sur-&#xD;
rounded by vast pits of smouldering fire. Then it seemed that&#xD;
the world had been destroyed, and that he was the sole survivor&#xD;
of his race, brooding upon the ruins. All the people he had ever&#xD;
known moved past him in grimacing and solemn procession.&#xD;
They were but as phantoms, that had never had a real existence.&#xD;
The life he had .lately lived was something vague and visionary,&#xD;
and far-off in the past; his own bodily form seemed strange to&#xD;
him; and he wondered at the gigantic proportions of the being&#xD;
that seemed himself. Suddenly, all this passed, and he saw one&#xD;
sole, clear image, as of purest amber, exquisitely soft and glo-&#xD;
rious, falling, falling forever, in a chaotic sky. It was the image&#xD;
of Charlotte.&#xD;
He knew not whether these fancies ended in sleep ; but when&#xD;
his mind aroused to consciousness again, the mountain fires had&#xD;
faded, and the dawn was faintly struggling through the dim smoke&#xD;
that shrouded the world'.&#xD;
&#xD;
XVI-&#xD;
THE MORNING AFTER.&#xD;
AL night long Mrs. Dunbury listened for Hector's footsteps&#xD;
in the hall; and it was not until after she had heard him enter at&#xD;
day-break, and go up to his chamber, that slumber overtook the&#xD;
thronging troubles of her brain.&#xD;
She was awakened by a knock at her door.&#xD;
"iWho is there?"&#xD;
Hector entered. He was pale and haggard.&#xD;
"0, my son !" said:she, reaching out her hands from her pil-&#xD;
low, "come here! ,What a night I have passed ! "&#xD;
"cWhat a night I have passed, mother ! "&#xD;
"iWhat have you been doing ?"&#xD;
 " Fighting fire."&#xD;
"iBut they told me there was no fire to fight."  -&#xD;
"Ah, but there was fire to fight ! "- and Hector laid his hand&#xD;
upon his breast. " Where is father?"&#xD;
" I think he has gone in search of you. He was awake all&#xD;
night; and as soon as it was beginning to grow light, he arose&#xD;
and went out."&#xD;
" That is well. When he returns, please inform him that I&#xD;
leave town to-day."&#xD;
"iLeave town !"&#xD;
"iTemper your -surprise, mother, and listen to me a moment."&#xD;
"But you must not- think of it ! " and Mrs. Dunbury held&#xD;
her son's hand with spasmodic energy. *" It will kill me to have&#xD;
you go!"&#xD;
"It will kill me to stay, mother !"&#xD;
"But reflect- "&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC8115-00000083"/>&#xD;
164               THE MORNING AFTER.&#xD;
"'I have had all night to reflect ; and I must go. Life here can&#xD;
be but one prolonged distress. 0, mother, what stuff mortality&#xD;
is made of! But a little time ago, the golden summer was all&#xD;
before me; now it is all behind me.  What was happiness is&#xD;
dust ; what was hope is ashes ! My brain is unsettled, and .I&#xD;
need solitude."&#xD;
" I pity you, my son ! "&#xD;
" None of your pity ! Rise up rather, like a Spartan mother,&#xD;
and charge me to be a man ! My destiny is not yet fulfilled.&#xD;
Have no fears for my welfare. There is no danger for me, except&#xD;
in resting here, to shrivel and wither up before my time."&#xD;
" But Charlotte -"-&#xD;
Hector pressed his forehead in his hand, as if to hold it from&#xD;
bursting.&#xD;
" Think of her ! "&#xD;
"0, God ! were it possible not to think of bier !"  A sigh&#xD;
shook his whole frame, and his voice was torn with anguish, like&#xD;
his heart. " But I will not be weak.' Let me make one last,&#xD;
request, mother. Do you know her whom we call Charlotte ?"&#xD;
" I think I do ; I think she is a pure and good girl-"&#xD;
" Think?  0, mother ! "- and there was a bright earnestness&#xD;
in Hector's eyes, -" I could tell you a story !-- To pass through&#xD;
what she has passed through -  0, we have never known her !"&#xD;
" I felt that, --I felt it all ! "&#xD;
" Then you should be ashamed to have said ' I think.' For&#xD;
my sake, cherish her with the tenderest care ; comfort her in suf-&#xD;
fering, be her friend at all times, and, happen what will, never&#xD;
forsake her !"&#xD;
"But you - why do you desert her ? why leave her at all ?"&#xD;
" Let that rest where it does -between her and me alone.&#xD;
If you knew all, then you would understand; then you would&#xD;
say, ' You do well to go.' - Destiny is strange - strange ! "&#xD;
The entrance of Mr. Dunbury interrupted the conference.&#xD;
" It sis a surprise to see you, sir," he said, with a somewhat&#xD;
surly look at Hector.&#xD;
" If that surprise could have been postponed some minutes&#xD;
longer, I should not be sorry. But, since you are here, I may as&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MORNING AFTER.                  165&#xD;
well deliver the message I was about to leave for you." And&#xD;
Hector named his proposed journey.&#xD;
"Very well," said Mr. Dunbury, doggedly. " I suppose that&#xD;
what I said yesterday has decided you."&#xD;
"What you said nettled me ; for I was sore from head to heel,&#xD;
when you hit me so rudely with your .speech. But that is passed&#xD;
with me, - I hope it is passed with you. I am grieved, not that&#xD;
you addressed me as you did, but that you, my father, could find&#xD;
it in your heart to address any one in such terms. I say this in&#xD;
all kindness, and with due respect; but I have of late fallen into&#xD;
the habit of plain speaking."&#xD;
Mr. Danbury looked fiery ; but whether from self-conviction or&#xD;
resentment, Hector did not know.&#xD;
" I leave to-day ; and only Heaven knows when I shall return,&#xD;
-if ever ! I have spent a happy summer with you here. You&#xD;
have been at most times a father to me ; you, mother, have&#xD;
been always more than a mother. I thank you both ! That I&#xD;
have not been worthy, I know too well, - too well! I am by&#xD;
nature imperious and self-willed, fitful and rash, and I have too&#xD;
often given rein to this wild horse of temper. You, dear mother,&#xD;
can forgive all that, and a thousand times more !  I hope you,&#xD;
my father, will forgive so much. Let me kneel here until I hear&#xD;
you say so."&#xD;
Hector got down by the bed, and hid his face.  The invalid&#xD;
pressed his noble head, and kissed his fair, flowing locks, sobbing&#xD;
audibly. For more than a minute, Mr. Dunbury looked on in&#xD;
rigid silence. Then his chest began to heave, and his lips to&#xD;
quiver, and a glistening moisture quenched the flame of his eyes.&#xD;
After two or three attempts, which pride appeared to foil, he&#xD;
stooped and took Hector by the arm.&#xD;
"Arise up now,"-his voice and manner betrayed emdtion&#xD;
struggling still with pride. "I-I do not like to see you so.&#xD;
You know I forgive you. Then let us be men, and talk and act&#xD;
like men."&#xD;
" Except we be first as little children, we can never be true&#xD;
men," said Hector, kneeling still.  ...*&#xD;
There was love, and suffering, and an indescribable softness i::&#xD;

his- tones, which troubled the parent's rugged spirit more and&#xD;
more. Mrs. Dunbury wept aloud. Then Hector reached forth&#xD;
instinctively, and- took his father's hand. For a moment, there&#xD;
was a terrible boiling and swelling of the restrained waters; then&#xD;
the ice gave away, and they gushed forth. The strong man was&#xD;
broken ; he sank down by the bed ; 'he threw himself on Hector's&#xD;
neck ; he cried out, in agony,&#xD;
"iI am the only offender ; I am not fit to live ! "&#xD;
" 0, my father!" said Hector, "my father ! my father !"&#xD;
The invalid wept still; but a deep happiness stirred under all&#xD;
her grief, and -sweetened her bitterest tears.&#xD;
On leaving his mother's room, Hector passed an hour in his&#xD;
own chamber, making preparations for his journey. . Then return-&#xD;
ing and finding her alone, and busily engaged in preparing some&#xD;
little comforts to remind him of her in his absence,' he bent over&#xD;
her tenderly, and took her hand.&#xD;
" Put away those trifles," said he, with a sad smile. ' "It&#xD;
pains me to see you strain your eyes, working for an ungrateful&#xD;
son ! "&#xD;
"iAnything I can do for you is a solace to my pain," replied his&#xD;
mother, blinded once more by her tears.&#xD;
"iBut there is something of deeper importance, and of dearer&#xD;
interest, that you can do for me now. I find I cannot go without&#xD;
saying one last word to Charlotte. I wish to feel that she under-&#xD;
stands me, and forgives me."&#xD;
"0, why did you not tell me this before?"&#xD;
"Why before, and why not now ?"&#xD;
"wCharlotte ! Charlotte ! "- a fresh distress choked the invalid's&#xD;
voice, - "she is gone ! "&#xD;
Blank disappointment sent the color from Hector's face. He&#xD;
repeated - "Gone !"&#xD;
" Half an hour since.  I could not detain her longer.  0,&#xD;
how she loves 'you! how she suffers, Hector ! She would have&#xD;
gone out wildly into the world last night, - anywhere, to&#xD;
meet any fate, to die; but my entreaties prevailed, and she&#xD;
remained. But this morning I could not move her. She&#xD;

' believed that it was her presence here that drove you from&#xD;
your home .-"&#xD;
" Which way did she go?"&#xD;
" To Mr. Jackwood's; it was by my advice ; I sent Cornelius&#xD;
with her."&#xD;
"It is well ! " said Hector. " After I am gone, send for her,&#xD;
-she cannot but come back to you. Perhaps it is better that I&#xD;
should not see her again. Tell her - tell her  to think kindly&#xD;
of me ; and-that 's all."&#xD;
His mother sobbed. He stooped and kissed her. "Bless you,&#xD;
bless you, mother ! " Then, returning to his chamber, he hastened&#xD;
to make final preparations for his journey.&#xD;

PARTINGS.&#xD;
STRANGE sensations crowded Charlotte's heart, as Corny set her&#xD;
down at Mr. Jackwood's gate. The hens cackled as of old ;&#xD;
Rover ran out; barking, and leaped upon her dress ; and the ris-&#xD;
ing generation of turkeys saluted her with a clamor of comically&#xD;
juvenile voices. Then Bim cried hello, with a good-natured grin ;&#xD;
and Phoebe appeared, clapping her hands delightedly.&#xD;
" You 've come to stop a week, I know, have n't you? " cried&#xD;
the young girl. "And, only think, gran'ma is going back to&#xD;
Sawney Hook, to-day, and we are all tickled to death ! But&#xD;
don't you tell her you 're going to stay; for it '11 make her so&#xD;
mad, I don't know but she 'd give up going, just to bother us ;&#xD;
she 's so everlasting ugly - if I do say it ! "&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood dropped her " flat " upon the kitchen table,&#xD;
where she was ironing a Rigglesty cap, and met Charlotte smil-&#xD;
ingly at the door; while the elder Abimelech, who was engaged&#xD;
in tinkering the' old lady's trunk on the inside (her travelling&#xD;
trunk, of course), put his head out and reached over, -- after&#xD;
rubbing his fingers on his trousers, - to shake hands with the&#xD;
visitor.&#xD;
"Here 's our Cha'lotte, gran'mother !"&#xD;
The old lady, bending painfully over a basin at the stove, occu-&#xD;
pied in washing out the Good Samaritan in a little dab of suds,&#xD;
looked up with a faint simper of recognition.&#xD;
"0 , how d'e do ? "-she pulled her shawl about her neck, with&#xD;
the tips of her wet fingers, as if she felt a draft of air from some-&#xD;
where in the direction of Charlotte. "Ye ben well ?"&#xD;
Charlotte had been quite well; and how was Mrs. Rigglesty?&#xD;

"0, 't an't o' much consequence about nee ! Still, it 's perlite&#xD;
to ask, I s'pose.  I an't a bit well.  I never be, late years.&#xD;
Slavin' for niy childern 's wore my constitution all down to noth-&#xD;

boat, I 've ben wus 'n ever. I've the terrible-est crickin' pain&#xD;
from my left ear all the way down my shoulder to the small o'&#xD;
my back ; nobody knows nothin' 't all what I suffer with 't, an'&#xD;
more 'n all that, I don't suppose nobody cares."&#xD;
And, dropping a silent tear in the dish of suds, she went on&#xD;
squeezing the Good Samaritan, snuffing and sighing audibly.&#xD;
"Gran'mother 's goin' to quit us to-day," said Mr. Jackwood,&#xD;
" an' I 'm sure I don' know how we 're goin' to git along without&#xD;
her!"&#xD;
" 0, 1 shan't be missed ! I 'm nothin' but a burden, seems, in&#xD;
some places! I got a-darter down to Sawny Hook, - that 's one&#xD;
comfort, -an' if she 's half as glad to see me as other folks be to&#xD;
git red on me, I shall be thankful. I got this 'ere han'some han'-&#xD;
kerchi'f," -wringing out the Good Samaritan,--" to make a&#xD;
present on 't to one o' the childern ; but there han't neither on 'eni&#xD;
desarved it, an' I don't see but I shall haf to carry it back to give&#xD;
to some o' Dolly's folks, arter all."&#xD;
Phoebe, in an under tone : " They 're welcome to the old&#xD;
thing, for all me !  For my part, I shall be glad to see the&#xD;
last on 't."&#xD;
Old lady: "What's that gal mutterin'?   Come, empty out&#xD;
these suds, an' gi me some rensin' water, can't ye ?  I want to&#xD;
git the han'kerchi'f to dryin', so 's 't we won't haf to put off iron-&#xD;
in' on 't till the very last thing. I'm afeard I shan't be able to&#xD;
git away to-day, arter all."&#xD;
At this alarming suggestion, Phoebe sprang, with alacrity, to do&#xD;
the old lady's bidding. In her haste, she bespattered Abimelech&#xD;
and Corny, who were approaching the kitchen door.&#xD;
Here ! " cried Bim; ".that 's smart ! Guess ye better look !&#xD;
Firin' yer darned old suds all over a feller !"&#xD;
" Bim'lech!" said Mr. Jackwood; "what's that4?"&#xD;
" Wal, she might ta' care ! I'll git a hull dipper full, and fire&#xD;
back, next time !"&#xD;

Mr. Jackwood :." There, there, you 're a terrible injured boy!&#xD;
What does Corny want ?"&#xD;
Corny, soberly : " I come perty nigh fergittin' my errant, arter&#xD;
all. I'd got started for hum 'fore I thought Mr. Dunbury said I&#xD;
might leave the -buggy, an' hitch on to your one-hoss wagin, if you,&#xD;
can spare 't 's well 's not. Hector 's goin' away, an' we want to&#xD;
take his trunks over to town."&#xD;
" Hector going ! " echoed Phoebe.  "Not to stay, is he ?"&#xD;
" I don't s'pose he 'd take his trunks if he was coming' right back.&#xD;
Mabby Charlotte knows."&#xD;
"Why, you never spoke of it, Charlotte ! ".&#xD;
Old lady: " I should n't think community 'd mourn much !&#xD;
He 's the sa'ciest young man, -an' so disagreeable ! jest like his&#xD;
daddy, for all the world, tho' I don't know't he drinks."&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood : "He 's dre'ful smart, though.  I alluz got&#xD;
along with Hector.  'Bout the wagon, Corny, -I dono'. We&#xD;
got to go over with gran'mother, some time this forenoon."&#xD;
Bim, brightly : "She might ride with Mr. Dunbury's folks."&#xD;
" I guess 't won't be wuth while for me to go at all, if it 's&#xD;
goin' to make so much fuss.   As for ridin' with them 'ere&#xD;
Dunburys -"&#xD;
And, giving the Good Samaritan a revengeful twist and shake,&#xD;
the old lady hung him before the stove to dry, with. an air which&#xD;
sufficiently expressed her sentiments on that subject.&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood, whose wits were sharpened by the bare thought&#xD;
of the old lady's being detained, proposed that Mr. Dunbury&#xD;
should have the wagon, and take aboard her big trunk, in pass-&#xD;
ing; and that the old lady herself should be transported, with&#xD;
her lesser baggage, in the buggy. Corny thought this arrange-&#xD;
ment would suit " fust-rate," and accordingly took his departure.&#xD;
"I'm real glad !" said Phoebe; "for Hector 'll have to stop,&#xD;
and we can bid him good-by, can't we, Charlotte?"&#xD;
The Jackwood family worked industriously. Mrs. Jackwood&#xD;
assisted in packing the trunk and doing up bundles, while Phoebe&#xD;
flat-ironed the Good Samaritan with a vengeance.  For the first&#xD;
time in his life, Bim showed a disposition to de something for the&#xD;
old lady; and Rover, impressed with the spirit of the household,&#xD;

her shoe.&#xD;
At length all was ready; and Mrs. Rigglesty, in her black&#xD;
bombazine, with her bonnet and cloak on, and her shawl about&#xD;
her neck, sat cooking her feet in the stove-oven, and sipping a&#xD;
cup of, boiling-hot tea. A quiet glee inspired Phoebe, and Bim&#xD;
manifested a naughty inclination to dance a hornpipe under the&#xD;
stoop.&#xD;
"I believe I 've got everything aboard," observed Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood, looking serious as possible.&#xD;
"I suppose you 're in a hurry to git me off !" sighed the old&#xD;
lady. "Wal, you won't be troubled with me agin very soon. Is&#xD;
my luncheon in the bag?  I wish there 'd ben a bit of cold ham&#xD;
to go long with it ; but never mind. Take this hot brick, Bim'-&#xD;

"Bim'lech ! " said Mr. Jackwood, in a suppressed voice, "quit&#xD;

" I was in hopes that lyin' pedler 'd be this way agin, 'fore I&#xD;
went. If he ever does show his face here, I hope you '11 give him&#xD;
a sound blessin', among ye, and git back the money he swindled&#xD;
me out of, for them shoes. - There, if you han't dropped that&#xD;
brick,!"&#xD;
Abimelech, chagrined: "I could n't help it, it 's so tarnal hot !"&#xD;
Old lady : " And you've broke it, I do declare ! I might&#xD;
knowed you would ! . You are the carelessest child- "&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood : "Never mind. We 'll make this answer till&#xD;
we git to the village, and take along another to heat at the&#xD;
tavern."&#xD;
Old lady, moving: "0, dear, Im down sick! I 'm no more&#xD;
fit to be trav'lin' 'n I be to fly ; but I s'pose I must go. Tuck my&#xD;
shawl up around my neck a little, Betsy."&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood, cheerily: "Step right up in the chair, gran'-&#xD;

thing to git into! 0 ! "- with a sudden scream, - "that crick&#xD;
in my back ! it 's killed me ! 0, dear ! "&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood: "There you be, mother ! You '11 find that an&#xD;
easy seat to ride on. How 's your back now?"&#xD;
"0, wal, 't won't trouble nobody much longer, that 's some&#xD;
consolation! If I only live to git to Sawney Hook, I shall have&#xD;
reason to be thankful. My umbrel', Phoebe ! I thought every-&#xD;
thing was ready."&#xD;
The umbrella was at .hand.  Phoebe passed it up with her&#xD;
good-by.&#xD;
"I s'pose that means good riddance !" muttered grandmother&#xD;
Rigglesty. " There han't none on ye kissed me."&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood, to facilitate matters, gave the example; Phoebe&#xD;
following with an expeditious smack.,&#xD;
Bim, aside to Charlotte: " I'm darned glad I an't no taller !"&#xD;
Old lady : "Come, sonny ! Ye han't ben a bit good boy sence&#xD;
I ben here ; but I '11 kiss ye."&#xD;
Bim, reluctantly : "Can't reach up ! "&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood: "Come, boy, we 're waitin' for ye ; git up in&#xD;
the chair. Kiss your gran'mother."&#xD;
Bim stepped up ; made a wry face ; received a kiss; -and, get-'&#xD;
ting down, with a violent scowl, scoured his lips on his sleeve as&#xD;
he went to open the gate.&#xD;
So the modern Eve rode -out of Paradise in Mr. Dunbury's&#xD;
buggy. Like our first parents, on a like occasion,&#xD;
"Some natural tears she shed, but wiped them soon ; "&#xD;
the Good Samaritan being brought freshly into service after&#xD;
Phoebe's ironing.&#xD;
"Sick 'em, Rove !' said Bim, recklessly, as the fussy shawl&#xD;
and hated bombazine passed through the gate, with the faded cotton&#xD;
umbrella spread against the wind.&#xD;
Rover barked; Phoebe skipped and sang; and Mrs. Jackwood's&#xD;
genial face looked smiling as a landscape after a long rain. But&#xD;
it was all a weary pantomime to Charlotte, whose sad eyes beheld&#xD;
the departure from the kitchen window.&#xD;
&#xD;
K'&#xD;
&#xD;
PARTINGS.                     173&#xD;
Scarce had the gloomy umbrella disappeared, when Mr. Dun-&#xD;
bury drove by with Hector.&#xD;
" Why, if they han't gone and forgot gran'mother's trunk !"&#xD;
And Phoebe ran out, bareheaded, screaming at the top of her&#xD;
voice. This was the first intimation Mr. Dunbury had received&#xD;
with regard to extra baggage, Corny having naturally forgotten&#xD;
to do his errand.&#xD;
" You was going without bidding anybody good-by, too !" cried&#xD;
Phoebe. " Did n't ye know Charlotte was here? Wait; I'll tell&#xD;
her, -she 'll come out."&#xD;
Ah ! there were two hearts that throbbed strangely, at those&#xD;
words 1, Happy Phoebe, who knew nothing of the agony of either !&#xD;
Charlotte had fled to Mrs. Jackwood's room. Her face was&#xD;
bowed and hidden.&#xD;
"Why!" cried Phoebe; "why don't you come? He's waiting."&#xD;
"Say good-by for me, Phoebe. It will be the same to him."&#xD;
" How you act, Charlotte ! You han't been a bit like yourself&#xD;
to-day ! What ails you?"&#xD;
"Do leave me, good Phobe !" pleaded Charlotte.&#xD;
Phoebe complied reluctantly. By this time Mr. Dunbury, with&#xD;
Bim's powerful assistance, had loaded up the old lady's trunk, and&#xD;
made all ready for a start.&#xD;
"She won't come," said Phoebe. " I guess she thinks you don't&#xD;
want to see her. I wish you 'd go in a minute ; but I s'pose you&#xD;
won't. What shall I tell her for you ?"&#xD;
A swelling grief in Hector's heart choked back the little message&#xD;
he would have sent. Yet he shook hands with Phoebe, and smiled&#xD;
upon her April tears, and expressed a kindly wish at parting; and&#xD;
so rode off, outwardly calm, but with the insupportable thought&#xD;
burning and aching in his soul, that the tragic curtain had fallen,&#xD;
to darken henceforth between him and her he loved, forever.&#xD;

love. Can't he the queerest mortal you ever see?  But I think&#xD;
he 's splendid! -don't you?  There 's Bertha Wing, and I don't&#xD;
know how many others, would give their eyes to- git him. I know&#xD;
I would," said Phoebe, frankly. "But this summer he never&#xD;
appeared to care for anybody but you. Maybe you might 'a got&#xD;
him, - don't you suppose you might, if you had tried ?"&#xD;
One afternoon, Phoebe came running to Charlotte, in high&#xD;
glee.&#xD;
"You can't think who 's come ! My heart almost hopped out&#xD;
of my mouth when I saw him ride up."&#xD;
Charlotte started, as Hector's image flashed momentarily before&#xD;
her.&#xD;
" How does my hair look ?" cried Phoebe. " Come up stairs ;&#xD;
I '11 put on my de-laine dress. Mother ! ask him into the setting-&#xD;
room. There 's his knock ! "&#xD;
Ah! too well poor Charlotte knew that knock; and it was&#xD;
needless now for the excited Phoebe to whisper, "It 's Robert&#xD;
Greenwich !"&#xD;
" I wonder if he knows you are here !" said Miss Jackwood,&#xD;
closing the chamber door. "Though I 'm sure he 's come to see&#xD;
me ! You would n't be surprised, if you knew half the things he&#xD;
said to me the other day. Will you hook my dress ? How nerv-&#xD;
ous I be ! Don't you like Robert ? What a splendid moustache&#xD;
he wears !"&#xD;
Charlotte assisted her friend to arrange her dress ; and, in&#xD;
return, Phoebe generously invited her to go down and share the&#xD;
visitor with her.&#xD;
"No, I thank you," said Charlotte. " If he has called to see&#xD;
you, I should be an intruder."&#xD;
The idea flattered Phoebe; and she had no wish to urge the&#xD;
point. Having taken a last. critical glance at her beauty in the&#xD;
glass, and given her "beau-catchers " a final polish, she descended&#xD;
alone, simpering and blushing, to charm the smitten Robert.&#xD;
The visitor staid nearly an hour ; during which time, at his&#xD;
suggestion, Charlotte was twice invited to the "sitting-room. But&#xD;
she persisted in her determination, and at length the foiled hypo-&#xD;
crite took his leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
XIX.&#xD;
THE DOVE AND THE SERPENT.&#xD;
iN its better moments, the soul looks with clear vision upon the&#xD;
confused drama of life, and sees use and meaning everywhere.&#xD;
Wisdom and beauty shift the scenes. The tragic and comic unite&#xD;
in holy marriage, bringing alternate laughter and tears, joy and&#xD;
trial, and love, and mighty sorrow, to the development and expan-&#xD;
sion of man's entire nature.&#xD;
But there are times when, from the shock of some terrible ex-&#xD;
perience, we grope, stunned and blinded, amid the ruins of happi-&#xD;
ness, and believe ourselves the mere playthings of chance. It was&#xD;
so with Charlotte now. What this last great tri 1 was for, she&#xD;
could not divine. How like a dream it all appeared ! Here she&#xD;
was again in Mr. Jackwood's house: life then was the same as it&#xD;
had been a few short months before : but, in the interim, what an&#xD;
existence had she lived !&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury sent early for Charlotte to return to the shelter&#xD;
of her abode. But she could not go back there. Hector's home&#xD;
could not be her home. Where hehad lived, she could not be at&#xD;
rest. Nor could her spirit find peace with her old friends.&#xD;
"Do you recQllect," said Phoebe, " the day when Mr. Dunbury&#xD;
called to borry Qur wagon, and told us Hector was coming home ?&#xD;
How long ago it seems ! Does it to you ? Everybody thought,&#xD;
one time, he was paying attention to you; and I expected, much&#xD;
as could be, you'd be married. 0, do you remember the stone he&#xD;
give me for a keepsake, the -day you ketched me asleep by the&#xD;
fence ? " And Phoebe, running to her closet, and taking out the&#xD;
cobble, rolled it upon the floor. "It 's like men's hearts, he said,&#xD;
and told me to look at it whenever I was in danger of falling in&#xD;

"0, 1 had such a nice chat ! " exclaimed Phoebe, running up&#xD;
stairs. "Say, he 's coming again ! Have I got pretty eyes ?"&#xD;
"Did he tell you so ?"&#xD;
The elated child smiled at herself in the glass, and put on self-&#xD;
complacent airs.&#xD;
"0 , I an't going to tell ! If he*did, I suppose it was in fun.&#xD;
He talked ever so much about you, and asked how long you are&#xD;
going to stay here, and whether you correspond with Hector. He&#xD;
said I need n't mention it to you; but I did n't promise. Would&#xD;
you care if he thought I was handsomer than you ? "&#xD;
Charlotte smiled. "I should not be at all displeased, my dear&#xD;
Phoebe !"&#xD;
Phoebe, affectedly: "I don't say he does, you know. If he said&#xD;
so, he probably did n't mean it. His moustache is perfectly&#xD;
bewitching, any way !"&#xD;
Charlotte ventured to utter a fe gentle words of warning&#xD;
against the fascinations of that gay moustache. But Phoebe would&#xD;
not listen to reason.&#xD;
"Hectorx was jealous of Robert, and prejudiced you against&#xD;
him, or else you would n't speak so. How old should you think&#xD;
he was ? Not over twenty-four, is he ? I shall be seventeen&#xD;
next July."&#xD;
So Phoebe chatted, on the same delicious theme, all that day,&#xD;
the next, and the day after. On the third day, Robert came&#xD;
again. This time he brought his sister Etty, the genius; by&#xD;
which stratagem he managed to compel Charlotte's presence, en-&#xD;
gage her in conversation, and make Phoebe jealous. The latter&#xD;
showed a good deal of spite towards her innocent friend; but&#xD;
when the visitors had gone, Charlotte talked with her so unself-&#xD;
ishly and kindly, showing her what a little fool she was, that she&#xD;
gave vent to her vexation in a shower of tears, embraced her com-&#xD;
panion, asked her forgiveness, and felt better.&#xD;
On the following day, Robert took the girls by surprise, as they&#xD;
were walking together by the creek_&#xD;
"ho would have thought I should be here again so soon ?"&#xD;
h e cried, gayly. " Is an excuse necessary ?"&#xD;
"0O, no !" said Phobe.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DOVE AND THE SERPENT.               177&#xD;
" Then I wish my excuse would keep until another time. But&#xD;
the truth is, I left a pair of gloves here yesterday."&#xD;
Phoebe: " I have n't seen any. What kind of gloves?"&#xD;
Robert entered upon a grave and minute description of the&#xD;
articles in question, expressing his conviction that they were on&#xD;
the mantel-piece, under the clock ; and it was expected of Phohe&#xD;
to go and find them.&#xD;
"You'll wait for me here?"&#xD;
"Certainly. Go quick! If you don't find them under the&#xD;
clock, look under the bureau; if they are n't there, hunt for 'em&#xD;
in the barn.-- The goose!" laughed Robert; "see her run!"&#xD;
Charlotte, indignantly : " It's wicked to deceive her so!"&#xD;
" Then love will have many sins to answer for. Every artifice&#xD;
seems right by which I get near you."&#xD;
" But you have made her believe you love her!"&#xD;
"The ninny! did she tell you so?  But why so angry?    I&#xD;
wish I could think 't was jealousy; then I should have some&#xD;
hopes. But we have no time to quarrel. The simpleton will be&#xD;
back presently, -unless she breaks her neck, as I devoutly pray&#xD;
she may ! Have you heard from Hector?"&#xD;
A shadow swept over Charlotte's face.&#xD;
"How should I hear from him?  Why do you ask'i"&#xD;
"Because -I have heard from him!"&#xD;
Charlotte started. The villain smiled, showing the edge of his&#xD;
white teeth under his moustache.&#xD;
"I had a letter this morning. It was written on board' the&#xD;
ship Excelsior, bound for California. Would you like to see it?"&#xD;
She did not speak ; she kept her large, intense eyes fixed upon&#xD;
a willow-twig she turned swiftly round and round in her fingers.&#xD;
"Indifferent, are you? " Again Robert's teeth showed their&#xD;
white points beneath his moustache. " He mentions your name,&#xD;
- shall I tell you what he says?"&#xD;
Faster still beat Charlotte's heart ; faster still she twirled the&#xD;
willow-twig. Robert opened a letter, and read.&#xD;
"' I had a queer experience with that girl, Rob. But it is all&#xD;
over now. The spell is broken. I was 'a great fool, where you&#xD;
would have been a great villain!' Complimentary to me, as ever,&#xD;

you see ! Still, he can't do without me. He invites me to meet&#xD;
him in San Francisco."&#xD;
The light of Robert's eye, and the glitter of his teeth, became&#xD;
lynx-like, as he watched her. ler restless fingers dropped the&#xD;
twig. He stooped to pick it up; but she put her foot upon it.&#xD;
"Show me that letter!"&#xD;
"So, you have changed your mind ?  Here it is. But, since&#xD;
you declined.it before, you shall give me a kiss for it now."&#xD;
" Give me the letter'! " and down went Charlotte's little foot&#xD;
upon the grass.&#xD;
Robert laughed impudently, but she kept :her eyes on his, and&#xD;
held out her commanding hand.&#xD;
" The kiss ! " said Robert.&#xD;
" I would not give you that for fifty letters, with fifty fortunes,&#xD;
each with fifty slaves like you! "&#xD;
" I like your temper ! Here, -take the letter!"  But Rob-&#xD;
ert knew she would not have it then. She had turned her back&#xD;
.upon him scornfully. "At least, tell me if you have any mes-&#xD;
sage to send to Hector,"-- and he, held her arm.&#xD;
" Let me go ! " she cried, with haughty mien. "Your touch&#xD;
makes me shudder ! Is not that enough?"&#xD;
"You speak very plainly!" said Robert.&#xD;
" So I can afford to speak. I have feared to offend you here-&#xD;
tofore, because it-has been in your power to crush me."-&#xD;
"Has been?" repeated Robert, significantly.&#xD;
"Has been, - and is but I do not care much now. Come&#xD;
what will, I am ready to meet it."&#xD;
The impure flame in Robert's eyes could not endure the light&#xD;
of her clear orbs. He shivered from head to foot.&#xD;
"You are a noble girl," he muttered, stifling the rage that&#xD;
stung him. "Bat you wrong me; and it is my fault, perhaps.&#xD;
I have not said to you what I would say, because you would&#xD;
never hear me. It is from no mean motive that I follow you; I&#xD;
am true and sincere; I would make you my wife."&#xD;
As Charlotte looked upon him, her whole form seemed to un-&#xD;
dulate and expand with emotions that swelled up from the depths&#xD;
of her injured soul.&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
.!*&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DOVE AND THE SERPENT.               179&#xD;
"A generous offer ! What more you could have said, I do not&#xD;
know ! I thank you! Still, suffer me to be true. My entire&#xD;
nature shrinks at the thought of giving myself to onlI do not&#xD;
love.- By no law, human or divine, can I ever, ever be yours.&#xD;
So Il have the same answer for you I had before. You may be&#xD;
vindictive, or you may be generous: I have been true: I have&#xD;
no more to say."&#xD;
Robert was astounded.&#xD;
' Stop ! " he aspirated, -" Charlotte ! "&#xD;
Impassioned, quivering, flushed, he strove to clasp her ; but she&#xD;
escaped his arm. He caught her cape; and, tearing it from her&#xD;
throat, she left it in his grasp. With a quick, desperate step, he&#xD;
followed her in the meadow, but stopped suddenly, with a curse&#xD;
muttered through his teeth, at sight of Phoebe. She was approach-&#xD;
ing, out of breath, to tell him that no gloves were to be found.&#xD;
" Why ! what is the matter with Charlotte?"&#xD;
"We have had a terrible quarrel!"&#xD;
Phoebe, with great eyes: "About what?"&#xD;
"About you, darling ! She is jealous.' Watch her, Phoebe. I&#xD;
shall walk by the corner of the orchard this evening at nine;&#xD;
meet me there, and I will tell you more."&#xD;
And, leaving Phoebe flattered and excited by the important&#xD;
charge, Robert retreated across the field.&#xD;
That night Charlotte conferred with Mr. Jackwood, whom she&#xD;
found the same prompt and hearty friend as of old. His earnest&#xD;
sympathy, and his ready promise of secrecy and aid, brought tears&#xD;
of gratitude to her eyes.&#xD;
" How shall I ever repay you?"&#xD;
"Don't speak o' that! I only'wish I could do suthin' hansum&#xD;
by ye," said the farmer.-" Hark ! who 's there?"&#xD;
Phoebe entered, with a shawl over her head.&#xD;
"I thoughtye was abed long ago ! Where ye ben?"&#xD;
Phoebe, very innocently: " Nowheres -- only setting under the&#xD;
stoop a little."&#xD;
" And here it is 'most ten o'clock ! Be ye crazy? .I hope ye&#xD;
han't ketched yer death-o'-cold, in the night-air. Go to bed !&#xD;
*  Cha'lotte an' me 's havin' a talk 't an't necessary you should hear."&#xD;

180           THE DOVE AND THE SERPENT.&#xD;
Phoebe, pretending obedience, lighted a candle, and withdrew.&#xD;
But the young girl had impressed Charlotte strangely; and, hav-&#xD;
ing vainly attempted to pursue the subject on which she had been&#xD;
conversing with Mr. Jackwood, she bade him good-night, and&#xD;
opened the entry-door just in time to hear a step and the rustling&#xD;
of a dress, and catch a glimpse of Phoebe's candle vanishing up&#xD;
the stairs.&#xD;
On the following day, Phoebe gave her father no peace, in her&#xD;
persistent efforts to draw from him the secret of his talk with&#xD;
Charlotte.&#xD;
"What a botheration you be ! " exclaimed the indulgent Jack-&#xD;
wood. " Will ye keep it to yourself, if I tell ye ?"&#xD;
"Of course I will-if it 's anything I don't ought to tell,"&#xD;
added Phoebe, securing that loop-hole for her conscience.&#xD;
" Wal, I expectt we 're goin' to lose Cha'lotte. Spite of all I&#xD;
can say, she thinks she must be goin' away to-morrow."&#xD;
"Going ?" echoed Phoebe, startled. "Where?"&#xD;
" That I don' know myself; only I 'm to carry her over to the&#xD;
railroad in time for the train 't goes north."&#xD;
Phoebe was touched; Phoebe was softened; Phoebe was no lon-&#xD;
ger jealous. She ran to Charlotte, and threw her arms around&#xD;
her neck.&#xD;
" I knew something was the matter !" she stammered forth.&#xD;
" You're going off, and it's me that's made you so unhappy you&#xD;
can't stay ! And you won't never forgive me,-- I don't see how&#xD;
you can ! "&#xD;
"My dear child ! " said Charlotte, very tenderly, "you have&#xD;
been a little unjust to me, but you have a good heart;. and I do&#xD;
forgive you, most sincerely."&#xD;
" I'm ashamed of myself! " exclaimed Miss Jackwood. "I&#xD;
never knew anybody half so good as you be, nor anybody that I&#xD;
ever loved half so well. And I won't ever see you again ! "&#xD;
"Perhaps not, dear child!"&#xD;
Then Phoebe threw herself wildly upon a chair, and indulged in&#xD;
spasms, and refused to be comforted on any account.&#xD;
" Why, Phoebe !" said her mother ; " you -shan't act so!&#xD;
You '11 break a blood-vessel!"&#xD;

Still Phoebe tortured herself; nor would she suffer anything to&#xD;
come between her and her grief, until Bim appeared, driving Ro-&#xD;
ver in harness. The pleasing novelty had a singularly quieting&#xD;
effect upon her nerves; and, five minutes later, she might have&#xD;
been seen busily engaged in sewing together strips of cloth for&#xD;
traces, with, the understanding that when the silly-looking cur was&#xD;
properly attached to the wagon, she should be allowed to drive.&#xD;
Still her grief returned at intervals, and was very violent indeed.&#xD;
It did not, however, prevent her from keeping an appointment she&#xD;
had made to meet Mr. Greenwich that night; and afterward,&#xD;
going late to bed, she slept so soundly, that, when called to break-&#xD;
fast, next morning, she dreamed that her mother was chasing her&#xD;
and Robert around the orchard with a broom, and crying to her&#xD;
to stop.&#xD;
It was a shill, cloudy day, and, as Mr. Jackwood drove&#xD;
through the gate with Charlotte, he felt a rain-drop strike his&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Hold on ! " said he; "we did n't put in the umbrel', arter&#xD;
all! Fetch it 'long, Bim'lech ! - Looks kind o' bad to see ,you&#xD;
start off on your ja'nt sich a day as this, Cha'lotte. Had n't ye&#xD;
better put it off till fair weather, think?"&#xD;
But Charlotte told him no. The time had come; and, dreary&#xD;
as the future seemed, she must go forth to meet it.&#xD;
"Come, come !" cried Mr. Jackwood, " what 's that boy&#xD;
about?"&#xD;
" He 's trying to make Rover draw the umbrella on the wagon,"&#xD;
said Phoebe.&#xD;
Bim, appearing around the coiner : " Git up, Rove ! He'p !&#xD;
clear the track ! The big team 's coming'!"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood : " Quit yer nonsense, boy, an' bring along that&#xD;
umbrel'!&#xD;
Bim, stoutly: "iAn't I bringin' it ?- Whoa, - back !"&#xD;
The wagon had struck a post, and lodged., While Bim was&#xD;
disengaging the vehicle, Rover took advantage of a slack remi,&#xD;
and, attempting to leap through a favorite hole in the fence, pro-&#xD;
gressed in the undertaking as far as his hind-quarters, whin the&#xD;

182          THE DOVE AND THE '$EPENT.&#xD;
wagon -held him fast. A terrific yelping ensued, as Bim helped&#xD;
him out of the difficulty by the legs.=&#xD;
" There !" said Mr. Jackwood, "don't le' me see that dog har-&#xD;
nessed up agin to-day! "&#xD;
He spread the umbrella, which Phoebe handed up to him, and,&#xD;
having once more earnestly counselled Charlotte to postpone her&#xD;
expedition, touched the horse with the whip, and drove away.&#xD;
Somehow, Charlotte'could not utter her "good-by."  Yet, as&#xD;
the animal trotted slowly along the dusty road, amid the pattering&#xD;
rain, she looked back. Mrs. Jackwood watched her from the front&#xD;
door, with a countenance. full 'of regretful and tender interest.&#xD;
Phoebe stood at the gate, waving her handkerchief in the air,&#xD;
and wiping her eyes with it, alternately. Even Bim, although&#xD;
ostensibly engaged in training Rover to hold up his foolish head&#xD;
in harness, and' keep his tail from between his legs, showed&#xD;
unmistakable signs of unmanly weakness, in passing the corner&#xD;
of his sleeve across his eyes. Then there was a repetition of fare-&#xD;
wells; and Phoebe and her mother went in, out of the rain;&#xD;
and Charlotte wasonce more a homeless wanderer in the gloomy&#xD;
world.&#xD;
Patter, patter, went the dull rain, drumming upon the umbrella,&#xD;
checkering the dusty bed of the, road, and rattling among the dry'&#xD;
leaves. The sky grew darker still, and a long line of showers&#xD;
swept along the misty mountain side. Then a peculiar smell of&#xD;
mould, exhaling from the earth, loaded the atmosphere. The&#xD;
weather was- chill, too, and Charlotte found it necessary to wrap&#xD;
her shawl closely about her, to keep warm.&#xD;
They rode past Mr. Dunbury's house, and Charlotte's sad eyes&#xD;
looked their last .upon the spot that had been more than a home&#xD;
to her, in the summer that was gone. The house stood silent and&#xD;
gloomy in the rain; the windows of Hector's chamber were closed&#xD;
and curtained ; and the little portico, under which he used to sit,&#xD;
was desolate and deserted. The only living object in view was&#xD;
Corny, who sat upon the fene, under the shelter of the door-yard&#xD;
trees, whittling. Recognizing the half-concealed face that peered&#xD;
from the sombre background of the umbrella, he poised his knife&#xD;

ment, to inquire after Mrs. Dunbury's health, and to receive a&#xD;
letter, which Bridget brought out for Charlotte, -then drove on,&#xD;
stopping not again until the railway-station was reached.&#xD;
"By jingoes!" said Mr. Jackwood, who Lever indulged in pro-&#xD;
fanity except on exciting occasions, " we 're jest in time ! There&#xD;
comes the cars!  Not many minutes to lose, nuther; for they 'll&#xD;
be off agin in a jiffy."&#xD;
Bell ringing, steam whizzing, wheels clanging and clashing,&#xD;
the engine, with the long train behind, rolled past the platform of&#xD;
the little country staton, and came to a'halt.- During the excite-&#xD;
ment of getting aboard, Charlotte happily forgot everything else.&#xD;
She was safely seated, and Mr. Jackwood had barely time to give&#xD;
her the check for. her baggage, and bid her good-by, when the&#xD;
bell rang again, the engine panted and gasped, and the train was&#xD;
once more in motion. She returned the hasty pressure of his&#xD;
hand, but she had no words either of-farewell or of thanks. The&#xD;
next moment, he was gone ; only strangers surrounded her ; and&#xD;
the terrible engine thundered on with the train that bore her&#xD;
swiftly to an unknown destiny, over a dark and rainy land.&#xD;
At first Charlotte -gave little heed to external objects. Her&#xD;
spirit dwelt deeply within itself. And now, notwithstanding the&#xD;
gloom and mist that shrouded the future, she experienced a sense&#xD;
of relief, amounting almost to happiness, in the thought that thus&#xD;
the past, with all its errors, with all its troubles. and alarms, was&#xD;
swept behind her, as it were, into a gulf.&#xD;
Swiftly, more swiftly still, sped the train, -on, on, on, through&#xD;
woods and vales, over streams and chasms, under the mountain's&#xD;
rocky ribs, with echoing clang and roar. Charlotte felt a wondrous&#xD;
joy swell in her heart at this wild speed. "Faster; faster - fur-&#xD;
ther, further -on, on, on ! " said her soul. When the train&#xD;
stopped at way-stations, she became impatient ; she could scarce&#xD;
keep her seat she wished to fly.&#xD;
Ah ! she did not see the crested snake that glided out of the&#xD;
abyss from which she fled, and followed in her track, and kept its&#xD;
glittering eyes upon her still!&#xD;
But once, when the cars had stopped, she looked out of the&#xD;

window, and glanced her eye up and down - the length of the&#xD;
train.&#xD;
There, upon the platform, stood the man who, of all men, she&#xD;
feared and abhorred. Her impulse'was to withdraw instantly&#xD;
from view; but already she" was observed; and the detested face&#xD;
approached, wreathed in smiles of hypocritical surprise.&#xD;
"By what singular chanbe   where in the wide world are you&#xD;
going?"&#xD;
The shock and revulsion of the moment had turned Charlotte's&#xD;
heart to ice.&#xD;
" The train is off again!" said Robert. ."Since there is room&#xD;
in your -car, I will take a seat beside you. How singular that&#xD;
we should both be travelling the same way ! "&#xD;
She gave neither word nor look in reply, nor did she stir when&#xD;
he entered and placed himself by her side, but sat faint, and cold,&#xD;
and still, while once more the rushing and thundering wheels bore&#xD;
her on and away.&#xD;

" TWO NEGATIVES DESTROY EACH OTHER."&#xD;
"Ir you please, sir," said the girl behind the counter, "yoiu&#xD;
have not paid for the cakes and coffee."&#xD;
"If- you -please, sir," repeated the customer, "you have&#xD;
not paid !-Simplicity or cunning ? You 're a wonderful raven!"&#xD;
He was a tall, meagre personage, with sunken cheeks, a cadav-&#xD;
erous complexion, a restless, glaring eye, locks thin and long, and&#xD;
a fine, light beard flowing like a stream of flax upon his breast.&#xD;
His hat was bruised ; his coat soiled with the rain, and buttoned&#xD;
tight to his throat ; no linen visible ; boots and trousers bespat-&#xD;
tered with mud.&#xD;
"Ravens fed the prophet !"  His voice had a sepulchral sound,&#xD;
ahd in speaking he started nervously, glancing with his quick,&#xD;
.bright eyes from side to side, with an alert expression. "You&#xD;
presented the cakes; you prevailed upon me to accept coffee; and&#xD;
I said C-erith - the brook that is before Jordan."&#xD;
" The raven presents her bill," suggested a glossy moustache,&#xD;
near the counter.&#xD;
As the speaker touched the meagre stranger's sleeve, the latter&#xD;
turned, with a shudder, and, flirting his arm violently, glanced&#xD;
at the ground with an expression of such loathing, that the spec-&#xD;
tators looked to see what crawling horror had occasioned the dis-&#xD;
turbance.&#xD;
"What was it?" cried a bustling little lady, running to the&#xD;
spot.&#xD;
The stranger rubbed his arm, a smile of triumph flitting across&#xD;
his pallid face.&#xD;
" It's only a shilling," insisted the girl at the counter.&#xD;

186                  TWO NEGATIVES.&#xD;
"{Only a-shilling," ejaculated the bustling little lady. "Dear&#xD;
me ! I thought something had bit him ! " looking along the floor,&#xD;
as if to find the money.&#xD;
"He shook him off into the fire, and he felt no harm ! " The&#xD;
stranger turned indulgently to the girl at the counter.  " Hear&#xD;
Plato ! -Think you that he who-possesses magnificent intellectual&#xD;
conceptions, and can contemplate all. time and all, being, can&#xD;
possibly consider -what do you call it?- cakes and coffee, as&#xD;
things of any great importance ?  The same of shillings. Had&#xD;
he one, or two, or twenty - dust ! - he would wash his hands of&#xD;
them! - But, with nothing that is Caesar's, what shall he render&#xD;
unto Casar ?"N&#xD;
At this juncture, the proprietor of the stall, interposing, re-&#xD;
marked, in a decided tone, that he was not Caesar, and knew&#xD;
nothing about- Casar's affairs; but that, if cakes and coffee had&#xD;
been consumed, cakes and coffee were to be paid for.&#xD;
" If it 's only a shilling," said a gentle voice ; and a veiled&#xD;
female, opening a modest little purse, drew forth the required&#xD;
change.&#xD;
" Temptation - avaunt ! " said the delinquent philosopher.&#xD;
"The vulgar pay; but great souls are exempt. True," bowing&#xD;
graciously, "1he has been scoffed at, cast into prison, beaten with&#xD;
stripes; the fate of greatness. But what is martyrdom ? Princi-&#xD;
ples are at stake. Choose you to satisfy these publicans ? For&#xD;
your soul's sake, if you have money, cast it from you ! And, a&#xD;
word of counsel ! "- with a glance at the glossy moustache -&#xD;
"beware of the grinning alligator ! There are evets in his com-&#xD;
pany, and a brood of saucy young vipers. They ride on his&#xD;
back, and wink with their blood-red eyes ! "&#xD;
" Dear me!" said the bustling little lady, "I don't see any-&#xD;
thing ! Where is it?"&#xD;
The stranger recoiled to let the moustache pass, but, step-&#xD;
ping quickly after, detained the veiled female by the fringe&#xD;
of her shawl.&#xD;
" His home is in- the mud ! There let him crunch turtles;.&#xD;
but keep him away from the birds' nests.' He is of~ the grinning&#xD;
species, and his breath is poisonous. Beware of the shaggy&#xD;
jaws!"&#xD;

'S,  }&#xD;

TWO NEGATIVES.                   187&#xD;
With gentle force she disengaged her shawl, and, passing on,&#xD;
traversed a wet wharf at the foot of the rainy town. Beyond lay&#xD;
a steamboat, in waiting for passengers proceeding northward by&#xD;
the lake; and, in company with a, crowd of umbrellas, carpet-&#xD;
bags, band-boxes, and hat-boxes, she went hurriedly aboard. The&#xD;
glossy moustache kept by her side; and the bustling little lady,&#xD;
accompanied by a short, swaggering gentleman, followed after.&#xD;
The stranger stood holding aloft the hand that had come in&#xD;
contact with the shawl-fringe, bowing and smiling fantastically.&#xD;
Presently he seemed to fall into conversation with it ; when, sud-&#xD;
denly appearing struck with some forcible remark from  his&#xD;
imaginary interlocutor, he kissed it worshipfully, and skipped&#xD;
along the wharf to the boat. At the door of the ladies' cabin, he&#xD;
encountered the glossy moustache, whose wearer happened at&#xD;
that moment to be engaged in biting it somewhat savagely.&#xD;
"Creep, you creature ! There 's your element," pointing at&#xD;
the lake. " You are out of your place above-board."&#xD;
As Robert Greenwich did not stir, the other moved cautiously&#xD;
by the door, stepping high, as if walking over some disagreeable&#xD;
object, and passed triumphantly into the cabin.&#xD;
" Woman !"--the stranger, advancing td the veiled fenlie,&#xD;
bent his tall form before her --" I beg your salutation!"&#xD;
And straightway down he went upon one knee; but, quick as&#xD;
thought, Charlotte had changed her place, leaving him in that&#xD;
rather singular posture before the vacant seat. Not the least&#xD;
disconcerted, regarding the movement simry as an invitation to&#xD;
be seated, .he arose, and, settling softly and reverently in the&#xD;
place she had occupied, maintained a dignified deportment in&#xD;
view of his imaginary honors.&#xD;
" Incognito-! " he said, significantly. "But I saw through the&#xD;
veil. The south wind came to my nostrils; it breathed your&#xD;
name in my ear!"&#xD;
Charlotte started with alarm; upon which a jubilant ight&#xD;
danced-in the stranger's restless eyes.&#xD;
"What if I whisper it?"  and his unshaven lips approached&#xD;
her trembling cheek. " The new Queen of Sheba, in search of a&#xD;
prime minister!"&#xD;

188                  T1 O NEGATIVES.&#xD;
If there was any mirthful element in this grave and formal,&#xD;
announcement, Charlotte's poor, startled heart could not see it.&#xD;
" All was foreshadowed, your majesty! A queen was to come&#xD;
out of the south, and she was to be known by her magnanimity&#xD;
and beauty. And the voice said unto me, 'Thou shalt be chief&#xD;
in the New Jerusalem! '--that is, your majesty's prime minister.&#xD;
Hail to the glorious dispensation ! No pollution of money ; no&#xD;
intemperance ; no poverty; no labor, except that to which each&#xD;
is impelled by the affinity of his genius. The Seven Wise Men&#xD;
have the credit. They are always with me,- except in potato-&#xD;
time ; then bad spirits haunt me."&#xD;
Charlotte's sad eye sought in vain among the people moving&#xD;
through the cabin for some friendly face, to which she might&#xD;
look for relief; when, perceiving Robert's sinister visage peering&#xD;
in at the door, the thought came to her that these two negatives&#xD;
to her happiness, like two negatives in a grammatical construe-&#xD;
tion, might be made to counteract each other.&#xD;
" Do you not observe that we are watched ?" indicating nega-&#xD;
tive number one.&#xD;
"Alligator's eyes !" exclaimed negative number two. "lie&#xD;
is amphibious ; send him to sea on a chip !"&#xD;
" But, consider -we must not speak -together when he is'&#xD;
near."&#xD;
" His hide is thick; but there's a sword to pierce 'twixt his&#xD;
scales,! A warrior for the truth - the queen's prime minister&#xD;
shall be commander-= a-chief of her forces. There 's danger threat-&#xD;
ened from the Low Countries. I'll make him my chariot, and&#xD;
ride him home from victory. - Ha!"&#xD;
Negative number two pointed, triumphantly, at the door.&#xD;
Negative number one had disappeared. Upon which Charlotte&#xD;
entreated negative number two to follow the example.&#xD;
"There 's slime on the threshold," said number two, rising.&#xD;
"I'll spread down my coat, when your majesty steps over. My&#xD;
armor shall be painted red, to cheat the enemy with the thought&#xD;
't is blood. But 1'11 ride a black steed, and have a mantle of&#xD;
darkness, that night and I may be of the same color ! .Adieu,&#xD;

TWO NEGATIVES.                  189&#xD;
No sooner was Charlotte left alone, than a chubby, smiling&#xD;
face, with gold spectacles and a squint, moved over to her from&#xD;
the opposite side of the cabin. It was the bustlitig little lady&#xD;
from the wharf.&#xD;
"IDo tell me what strange being is that ! Is n't he insane ?"&#xD;
"I think so ; but I never saw him until this hour."&#xD;
And Charlotte, eager for sympathy and protection, proceeded&#xD;
to relate the adventure.&#xD;
" Dear me! how queer !" exclaimed the chubby little lady.&#xD;
a An't you afraid of him?"&#xD;
" 0, no ! " Charlotte smiled sadly. " The boat will start pres.&#xD;
ently; he will lose me and forget me, and perhaps go about find-&#xD;
ing other princesses."&#xD;
"But if he should go with the boat ?"&#xD;
" 0, he has no money ! "&#xD;
"He won't stop to think of that ! - Are you travelling&#xD;
alone?"&#xD;
"aI have no person on whom I can depend."&#xD;
" I'll tell my husband," said the chubby lady, " and have him&#xD;
speak to the cap'n; that '11 fix it ! You better keep with us,&#xD;
hadn't ye?"&#xD;
Charlotte gladly accepted the proposal; then, the chubby lady&#xD;
calling her husband, the chubby lady's husband consulted an -offi-&#xD;
cer of the boat, and the officer of the boat addressed the self-&#xD;
styled prime minister. This individual had not only remained&#xD;
on board, but he manifested a decided disinclination to going&#xD;
ashore; and, to save him from violent handling, Charlotte, at the&#xD;
chubby lady's suggestion, and in the chubby lady's company, left&#xD;
the saloon, to speak to him.&#xD;
" Salutation, your majesty ! The alligator is gone, and I keep&#xD;
guard. But here are conspirators! They exact money, and&#xD;
propose removing me from the boat. If they do, the boat shall go&#xD;
with me. I have Chilo's word for it, in the voice of the sacred&#xD;
titmouse."&#xD;
Chubby lady, pressing forward: " Let 'em do it; then have the&#xD;

Charlotte: "She is a companion."&#xD;
"Ah ! the Duchess of Dingledom! I knew a duchess once.&#xD;
'As I was going to St. Ives,' as they say in the arithmetic. She&#xD;
had the crooked back of a witch, and a crooked nose and chin;&#xD;
and in her mouth she had a twitch, and in her gait she had a&#xD;
hitch, and in her hand she carried a switch, to aid her work of&#xD;
sin. She had fifty imps for children. Go not too near her,&#xD;
your, majesty ; she has handled crawling things. What she&#xD;
observed of law savors of the profane. There shall be no litiga-&#xD;
tion in our kingdom."&#xD;
Charlotte : " Nor resistance. Go peaceably from the boat,&#xD;
will you not ?"     -&#xD;
Prime minister: "That's good calculation !  Euclid came,&#xD;
in the form of a black humming-bird with six wings, and taught&#xD;
me the new method in three easy lessons. No offence, Dingledom ?&#xD;
You 're an excellent creature; but you need washing. If I fall&#xD;
in with the alligator, there '11 be teeth broken. Once more--&#xD;
adieu, your majesty ! -Good-by, your grace ! What shall be the&#xD;
signal ?"     .&#xD;
Charlotte placed her finger on her lips. The prime minister&#xD;
looked intelligent; bowed profoundly, and, glancing from side to&#xD;
side, with quick starts, as if fearing surprise, marched over the&#xD;
plank to the wharf.&#xD;
" To think ! " exclaimed the chubby lady, delighted, "he&#xD;
called me a duchess ! How nicely we have got rid of him ! "&#xD;
Ah, but there was another who could not -be got rid of so&#xD;
easily ! Charlotte's mind reverted- to Robert, and her eye wan-&#xD;
dered up the street to watch his -coming.&#xD;
"Do look at him ! " exclaimed- the duchess, alluding to nega-&#xD;
tive number two. " Where d' he get that pitchfork ?"&#xD;
"A lance to spear alligators!" cried the prime minister. "The,&#xD;
Seven Wise Men sent it by an invisible messenger."&#xD;
And, shouldering the implement, he marched to and fro across&#xD;
the wharf, -with stately pace, like a sentinel. He had scarce&#xD;
oommene~ed a second turn, when the invisible messenger became&#xD;
suddenly visible, appearing in the form of a juvenile hostler,&#xD;
in ragged trousers and a dirty shirt, who, standing agape to see&#xD;
&#xD;
TWO NEGATIVES.                   191&#xD;
the steamboat off, had placed the fork temporarily against a&#xD;
post.&#xD;
"Here! "whined the young Mercury, running after him, "give&#xD;
it up ! They did n't send it to ye ! It 's mine ! Pa wants it to&#xD;
pitch hay in the shed ! Come!"&#xD;
The prime minister chose, however, to consider himstill invisi-&#xD;
ble, and continued his stately march, with strides magnificent,&#xD;
regardless of the clamor at his heels.&#xD;
"Le's stay out and watch him," said the duchess. "It don't&#xD;
rain, now ; and- my husband says the boat 's going to start in a&#xD;
few minutes."&#xD;
The bell began to ring, and the passengers from the wharf&#xD;
hurried aboard. Still no Robert.Greenwich; and Charlotte con-&#xD;
ceived a trembling hope that he might not appear.&#xD;
" I shall. die, laughing at that crazy man !" exclaimed the&#xD;
duchess. "Howfunny the boy looks, with his smutty face ! He&#xD;
is beginning to cry. I wonder why don't we start!"&#xD;
The bell continued to ring ; the steam escaped with a loud&#xD;
noise ; then came three or four sailors, bearing a long box. How&#xD;
slow they were, thought Charlotte. Too slow,alas ! for while they&#xD;
' were still upon the plank Robert Greenwich appeared, walking&#xD;
at a. rapid pace towards the boat. Charlotte's heart sickened.&#xD;
How vain her hope seemed, then ! She should have known that&#xD;
one so remorseless and so resolute as he would not be left behind.&#xD;
" Why, what 's the crazy man about ?" cried the excited&#xD;
duchess. "Do look at him!"&#xD;
Charlotte looked with amazement.   Negative number two,&#xD;
springing upon negative number one, had dexterously thrust the&#xD;
fork-handle between his feet, in a manner to trip and send him&#xD;
headlong to the ground. Then, instantly, the implement turning&#xD;
in Chetair, the two broad tines lighted astride the neck of the&#xD;
fallen man, as he attempted to i-ise, and pinned him to the wharf.&#xD;
He struggled and cried out; but the warrior for the truth thrust&#xD;
valorously; and, with face in the sand, eyes starting from their&#xD;
sockets, knees and elbows braced desperately, and one hand&#xD;
grasping the fork with a furious endeavor to unfix its yoke-like&#xD;
embrace, Robert bore not a slight resemblance, perhaps, to a&#xD;

The plaik was secured, the cables plashed in the water, the&#xD;

Bystanders, meanwhile, ran, to Robert's rescue. The over-&#xD;

creetly to his heels, and fled with light and airy bounds up the&#xD;
street.S&#xD;
Shouting, furious, swinging his bruised and muddied hat, Robert&#xD;
flew to the edge of the wharf. The steamer was just beyond; but'&#xD;
a boiling chasm whirled between. He dared not leap; he stood,&#xD;
a picture of baffled rage, his fiery eye glaring upon 'Char-&#xD;
lotte, from the landing. Just then the sun broke through a&#xD;
cloud, and poured a flood of golden light upon the scene. The&#xD;
foam sparkled, the waves danced, the shore receded, and the ves-&#xD;

Phoebe stood looking vacantly out of the window, towards the&#xD;

me ! Ever since Charlotte went, I can't do anything,- not even&#xD;

potato-kettle. "I remember putting something on the pump, and&#xD;
it must be that."&#xD;

Rover, if he did not actually think it was a sham-fight, meant to&#xD;
make it one, and began to whisk and caper about the yard; some-&#xD;
times stopping to shake the garment playfully, or lying upon it&#xD;

Rover had dropped the article beside the path, and gone to roll&#xD;

the dirt from his ears, and lay, with his nose upon the ground,&#xD;
ready for a spring. Mr. Jackwood frowned; Rover winked and&#xD;
looked knowing.&#xD;
" Roverf! behave ! "&#xD;
" G-r-r-r-r-r-r !" said Rover.&#xD;
Mr. Jaekwood measured his distance, and rushed suddenly upon&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
3IM's DISCOVERIES.                 195&#xD;
the disputed property. But Rover, at a pounce, was there before&#xD;
him. He caught the cape in, his teeth ; as it happened, however,&#xD;
somebody's foot was on one corner of it; and the next moment&#xD;
somebody's hand clutched the loose hide about his neck. Rover&#xD;
pleaded; Rover whined; but the hand held fast.&#xD;
"Come here, sir!" said Mr. Jackwood. "If you can't tell&#xD;
when folks are in arnest, an' when they 're in play, I'll lar ye,&#xD;
so 's 't you 'll know, in futur'!"&#xD;
" I'11, try ! I '11 try ! I 'Il try!" yelped Rover, plainly as&#xD;
talking.&#xD;
"It 's Bim 's to blame!" interposed Phoebe. "He 's always&#xD;
fooling with him!"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood appeared to consider that Phoebe was not far&#xD;
from right; and, having bestowed a few light outs across Rover's&#xD;
back, dismissed him, with a grave admonition. The dog ran off,&#xD;
rubbing his left ear with his paw, and lay down, dejectedly, under&#xD;
the wagon.&#xD;
Meanwhile Phoebe had possessed herself of the garment, and&#xD;
taken it to the house. Had it been a common article of apparel,&#xD;
it would have attracted very little attention; but it was a light&#xD;
and graceful cape of Charlotte's own manufacture, and. the fair&#xD;
figures her needle had wrought, together with its original delicate&#xD;
white color, rendered its recent cuts and stains all the more strik-&#xD;
ing by contrast. What surprised the family most was the dis-&#xD;
covery that some of the stains were of blood.&#xD;
" Le' me see it !" said Mr. Jackwood, taking the article in his&#xD;
hand, for the twentieth time. " Suthin' here ! " with 'a profound&#xD;
expression. "Mother, look an' spe if' that wan't cut with a&#xD;
knife!"&#xD;
Mother looked; Phoebe looked; and Mr. Jackwood looked&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"What do you think, father?" asked the excited Phoebe.&#xD;
".The dog never tore that in this world ! It's been cut ; an'&#xD;
this blood on 't an't~ four-'n-twenty hours old, or I miss my&#xD;
guess! Where in the world could the dog git holt on't? Where's&#xD;

"'What do you mean?   What have you done?"&#xD;
"I told Robert when Charlotte was going away, -   don't&#xD;
know what I did it for, - but he made me think--"."&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood: "He made ye think the moon was made o'&#xD;
green cheese, if he tried to, I 've no doubt ! Did n't I tell ye&#xD;
Cha'lotte wanted it kep' from everybody ?-But what has that to&#xD;
do with the cape ?"&#xD;
"iIf anything has happened to her, it's all owing to me ! " said&#xD;
the remorseful Phoebe. "She was afraid of him, an' one day they&#xD;
had a dreadful quarrel down by the crick. He said 't was because&#xD;
she was jealous of me."&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood: "Jealous of you! That 's an idee ! For my&#xD;
part, I never imagined Robert cared a. snap of his finger for&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
"Where 's Bim'lech, I wonder ?" said Mr. Jackwood. " That&#xD;
boy never 's in sight when he 's wanted !"&#xD;
"Wh at boy never 's in sight when he 's wanted?" cried a&#xD;
blustering voice at the door.&#xD;
Phoebe: "Here he is ! "&#xD;
Abimelech, stoutly : " Yes, here he is ! An' he 'd like to find&#xD;
out who 's ben lickin' Rove'?"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood: "S'posin' I have?  What then ? "&#xD;
"Wal! "- began the younger Jackwood, with a belligerent&#xD;
shake of the head.&#xD;
"Wal, what ?",&#xD;
"I I'd- like to know what he 'd ben doin', - that 's all!"&#xD;
"He was tearin' this 'ere'cape ; an' what I want of you is, to&#xD;
tell how he come by it."&#xD;
Bim looked ignorant : " What cape ?"&#xD;
" Charlotte's cape," cried Phoebe. "It's been cut, and tore,&#xD;
and there 's blood on it! ,Where did you find it?"&#xD;
" Jes' if I found it ! What you talkin' 'bout ?"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood, sternly : " Look a' here, Bim'lech !"&#xD;

Phoebe: " He does know ! I can tell."&#xD;
Bim: "You can tell, a sight ! Rove found it down in the&#xD;

Mr. Jackwood: "B1im'lech, 'tend to me ! Tell me how it come&#xD;

" Rove tore it ; I was goin' to lick him for 't, if I could ketched&#xD;

"But that was done with a knife !"&#xD;
"'T was jes' so when I found it, - perty nigh."&#xD;
Phoebe: "You said Rove found it ! "&#xD;

" That 'll do, Phoebe ! Bim'lech, do you know anything about&#xD;

Bim, interested : " What blood?  0! that ! You make a&#xD;
great fuss about an old rag, I should think ! An't we goin' to&#xD;
have no dinner to-day ? Where 's the wash-basin?"&#xD;
" Bim'lech," said Mrs. Jackwood, " come here!"&#xD;
Bim, scowling: "What ye want?"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood held the young gentleman by the collar, and,&#xD;
wetting the corner of her handkerchief with her tongue, rubbed it&#xD;
on his cheek.&#xD;
" Come ! " exclaimed Bim, jerking away; what'ss that for ?"&#xD;
"Hold still ! what 's on your face?"&#xD;
"I d'n' know ! what? - 0, Pheeb ! you can't guess what I&#xD;

"A letter ! Where did you git it ? "&#xD;
Bim, triumphantly : " I found it with the cape ! "&#xD;
Phoebe : "It 's Robert Greenwich's name on the back-! And&#xD;
there's blood on the letter ! Are you sure you found them&#xD;

wood. "Hold here agin, Bim'lech. - Han't you ben havin' the&#xD;
nose-bleed ?"&#xD;
" Yes, -I had the nose-bleed a little ! What of it?"&#xD;
"An' you got blood on the cape ! "&#xD;
" Mebby I got a little on.".&#xD;
"IBim'lech ! ". said Mr. Jackwood, solemnly, "step this way-!&#xD;

" Wal, don't I?2 "&#xD;
" I wan't going' to punish ye; we only wanted to know, the truth&#xD;
of the matter ; for we was afraid suthin' had happened to Char.&#xD;
lotte. Now, was there, or was there not, blood on the cape when&#xD;
you found it?"&#xD;
Bim, hesitating: "The rain, or suthin', had spotted it, any&#xD;
way "&#xD;
"And you cut it with your knife a little, did n't ye?" in a&#xD;
coaxing tone.&#xD;
Bim, doubtfully : "Le' me think ! Yes, now I remember ! I&#xD;
did cut it a little; but 't was an old thing! "&#xD;
Phoebe: "0, what stories ! "&#xD;
"Phoebe ! I' mdealin' with him ! .What 'd ye cut it for?"&#xD;
"Wal," Bim scratched his head,   "I cut it!-'t wasn't&#xD;
good for nothin'!"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood, tapping the floor with his foot: " Answer my&#xD;
question ! "&#xD;
"I d'no, -I thought-"    Bim  began to grin -" 't would&#xD;
make a good jacket for Rove, -like that the little monkey had&#xD;
on to the caravan."&#xD;
"Boy ! Then you made these holes ? "&#xD;
Bim looked foolish: "Wal, -I had to make some holes for&#xD;
his legs, or it would n't stay on to him."&#xD;
"That 's right ! " said Mr. Jackwood, apprQvingly ; "always&#xD;
tell the truth, my son ; for liars never prosper."&#xD;
Phoebe: "I should n't think he 'd prosper, then!"&#xD;
"'h!never mind ! he 's done perty well.- How did you git&#xD;
the nose-bleed, my 8on?7"&#xD;
&#xD;
C&#xD;

BIM'S DISCOVERIES.                199&#xD;
"He did n't like the jacket; an' when I held him to put his&#xD;
legs in the holes, he jumped, an' kicked, -till by 'n' by he hit my&#xD;
nose the awfullest tunk with the back of his head ! I hung on,&#xD;
though, till I see the blood runnin'; then he cut for the house,&#xD;
with the cape hangin' by his neck an' one leg."&#xD;
" Why could n't ye a' told this in the fust place?"&#xD;
Bim, giggling : "'Cause you was all makin' sich a fuss about&#xD;
the ol' rag, an' I did n't know how hard I'd have to take it ! I&#xD;
meant to tell, all the time; but I thought 't' would n't do no hurt&#xD;
to let on a little to once."&#xD;
" That don't explain how the cape come in the meader, arter&#xD;
all. And Green'ich's letter with it, too !- I don't s'pose 't '11 do&#xD;
no harm to open it, sence the wafer 's broke, an' find out who&#xD;
wrote it. -What name 's that 'ere, Phoebe ? Your eyes are bet-&#xD;
ter 'n mine."&#xD;
"Why, it 's Hector Dunbury's!"&#xD;
"Hector Dunb'ry's, hey?  Wal, I guess we 'll set up to the&#xD;
table, now; and arter dinner, Bim'lech, you can go 'n' carry the&#xD;
letter over to Mr. Dunb'ry's folks. If it 's from Hector, they 've&#xD;
a better right to it than we have. Don't be readin' it, Phoebe !"&#xD;
Phoebe : "I an't, -but, -how strange ! Hector 's gone to&#xD;
Californy!"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood : " Here, here ! you shan't read it ! Give it to'&#xD;
me. . Can't be he 's gone to Californy ! His folks 'u'd know&#xD;
suthin' 'bout it, if he had."&#xD;
Phoebe: "Just let me make out this sentence. It 's something&#xD;
about Charlotte."&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood: " Come, Bim'lech, take off your cap, an' wash&#xD;
your face, if you're goin' to Mr. Dunbury's. Don't throw your&#xD;
cap ! I declare for 't!"&#xD;
Bim, flinging his cap at the sink-shelf, had missed his aim, and&#xD;
sent it plump into the churn. A tumult ensued, as Mrs. Jack-&#xD;
wood, in great 'trepidation, fished it out, and hastened to hold it,&#xD;
with the dripping cream, over a milk-pan.&#xD;
Bim, with bravado: "You might keep the churn covered up!"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood: " How many times did I tell you, Phobe ! -&#xD;
I~t 's well for both of ye 't I'ye got my hands full !"&#xD;

."I don't know what I did with the cover," said Phoebe, still&#xD;
clinging to the letter.&#xD;
"Come, come!" exclaimed Mr. Jackwood. "Have I got to&#xD;
take it away from you by main force ?"&#xD;
Phoebe, relinquishing her hold: "I don't think Hector speaks&#xD;
very well of Charlotte, anyhow ! That 's the way with men&#xD;
though; and I suppose Robert will write to him: the same about&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
Mrs, Jackwood. "Father, do set that child to doin' suthin'!&#xD;
If you can't think of anything else, take the pie out of the oven.&#xD;
Then hunt for that churn-cover till   you find it."&#xD;
Phoebe opened the oven-door. There was no pie there; but in&#xD;
its place-she found the missing churn-cover, baked brown, and so&#xD;
hot that she dropped it on the floor with a scream.&#xD;

XXII.&#xD;
TWO SKELETONS IN ONE HOUSE.&#xD;
AN old gentleman, in a loose suit of drab, with a white cravat,&#xD;
a white whisker, and a thin fleece of white hair frizzled all over&#xD;
his head, took off his hat (a white one) to the clerk of a second-&#xD;
class hotel, in Montreal.&#xD;
" I wish to see a - a Miss -a Miss - "  The white gentle-&#xD;
man hesitated, and fumbled in his breast-pocket. " I've forgotten&#xD;
the name, and left the letter at home. I'll glance at your books,&#xD;
if you please."&#xD;
" Presently," said the clerk ; " as soon as this gentleman is done&#xD;
with them."&#xD;
The gentleman referred to was a gay young fellow, with a mous-&#xD;
tache; precisely such a moustache, by the way, as Phoebe Jack-&#xD;
wood so much admired, and pined to behold once more, on Hun-&#xD;
tersford Creek. The wearer looked up, with a questioning air, at&#xD;
the clerk.&#xD;
"Mr. Sperkley's party arrived here the twelfth?"&#xD;
" Ay," said the clerk, " night before last."&#xD;
"Is Mr. Sperkley in?"&#xD;
"Mr. Sperkley is out, this morning?"&#xD;
"Thank you; I will call again," -and the moustache retired.&#xD;
"Sperkley, - Sperkley," repeated the white gentleman, refer-&#xD;
ring to the register. " That is the name I was to inquire for, I&#xD;
think. 'JMr. Sperkley, lady, and friend,'-- and it 's the friend I&#xD;
desire to see. Is she in?" &#xD;
"A young lady; ay,-I think so. Shall I send up your name?"&#xD;
The white gentleman's card being despatched to Mrs.. Sperkley's&#xD;
apartment, answer was promptly returned that the ladies would&#xD;

mheet him in the public parlor, He had not long to wait. Scarce&#xD;
had he taken his seat, when a bustling, chubby little woman en-&#xD;
tered, bright and smiling as the sun, and breathless with running&#xD;
down stairs. She was dressed in stiff, rustling silks, and wore&#xD;
heavy jewels in her ears and on her fingers; gold-bowed spectacles&#xD;
on her nose, a massive'chain of gold about her neck, and a watch&#xD;
and pencil in her belt.-&#xD;
"fHow do you do?" she cried, with a hearty demonstration of&#xD;
friendship. "Have you seen my husband?"&#xD;
"Your husband ?-- Is this Mrs. Sperkley?"&#xD;
"Yes, this is Mrs. 8perkley,"- with an air which seemed to&#xD;
say,don't you think it's a pretty nice Mrs. Sperkley, after all?-.&#xD;
"And you are Mr. Holyland?"&#xD;
"Longman was the name on my card."&#xD;
"Longman?    Dear me! how could I make that mistake, and&#xD;
read it Holyland ?"-&#xD;
"I wish to see a young lady who is, I think, in your company."&#xD;
"j0, the person we got acquainted with aboard the boat  She&#xD;
has been expecting some one to call. I'11 run and speak to her."&#xD;
She rushed, rustling, from the parlor. The white gentleman&#xD;
looked dissatisfied, and walked the room as if he was more than&#xD;
half inclined to walk out of it, and out of the hotel, and out of the&#xD;
society of Mr. Sperkley, lady, and friend, forever. His expression&#xD;
brightened, however, when the door again opened.&#xD;
" Miss -Woods-"   Charlotte smiled assent, and he gave her&#xD;
his hand. " I received your note accompanying Mrs. Dunbury's&#xD;
letter last night, but at too late an hour -"&#xD;
'o not apologize," said Charlotte, embarrassed. "You are&#xD;
but too kind to come to me at all. On Mrs. Dunbury's recom&#xD;
mendation, I ventured to apply to you,- I am here, a stranger,&#xD;
-and what I desire is, to find some situation--"&#xD;
" Leave that to the future," replied the white gentleman.&#xD;
"flow are you situated here at the hotel?"&#xD;
" Comfortably as could be expected, I suppose."&#xD;
" And your friends?"&#xD;
~"Friends? - I have none."&#xD;
"I mean, the Sperkley family."&#xD;
&#xD;
U'&#xD;
&#xD;

" 0! " said Charlotte, with a smile, "I may, perhaps, call&#xD;
them friends, for they have been kind, and helped me through&#xD;
difficulties in travelling that I could hardly have surmounted&#xD;
alone. But they are mere chance acquaintances."&#xD;
"So much the better ! Now, I-'ll tell you what; without any&#xD;
ceremony, and with as little delay as possible, you shall leave'&#xD;
this house, and go home with me. So much accomplished, we '11&#xD;
see what else can be done. One thing'at-a time, is my motto."&#xD;
It had been so far from Charlotte's expectation or design to&#xD;
intrude upon anybody's hospitality, that the offer appeared all the&#xD;
richer and more welcome to her homelessness. With a full heart&#xD;
she accepted it, This settled, the white gentleman, having a small&#xD;
business matter to attend to in the same street, took leave, but&#xD;
returned promptly, in' half an hour, as he had promised. Char-&#xD;
lotte was ready for a departure, and had nothing to do but, ex-&#xD;
change "tgood-bys " with Mrs. Sperkley.&#xD;
" Our acquaintance has beenvery pleasant," said the duchess,&#xD;
making an affecting demonstration with her handkerchief. "I am&#xD;
very sorry to lose you so soon; and, rebly, I-shall have a good&#xD;
cry over it, when you are gone!"&#xD;
The little woman exhibited something of the genuine ore of&#xD;
human feeling, as well as a good deal of the dross ; and Char-&#xD;
lotte, in whom the faintest show of kindly sympathy on the part&#xD;
of others never failed to awaken grateful emotions, returned her&#xD;
boisterous kiss with a quiet touch of her pure lips, accompanied&#xD;
with "an earnest inward prayer for her happiness. At parting,&#xD;
the duchess wished her to accept a gold ring, which she. drew&#xD;
from her finger, as a memento ; but Charlotte with gentle dignity&#xD;
declined it, and it went back to its place on the chubby red hand.&#xD;
A few minutes' ride brought Charlotte and her companion to a&#xD;
plain, sober little house, pleasantly located, in the upper part of&#xD;
of the town. $This proved the residence of the white gentleman;&#xD;
and here, disembarking with her baggage, she was velcomed to&#xD;
her new home by one of the sunniest faces sh had ever met.&#xD;
" My daughter, Mrs. Lawrence Longman," said the white gen-&#xD;
tleman.&#xD;
She was not beautiful; -she was pale and faded: but there was&#xD;

something exceedingly tender in her expression, which drew Char-&#xD;
lotte to her at once.&#xD;
"I was sure father would bring you home with him," said Mrs.&#xD;
Lawrence.  "Your room is all ready for you."&#xD;
It was a cosey little chamber, the windows of which looked out&#xD;
upon a garden and a country road. On entering it, Charlotte was&#xD;
thrilled with happiness and surprise. She glanced around her;.&#xD;
she gazed from the window; she turned her suffused eyes upon the&#xD;
smiling, tender face of the gentle woman who had given her so&#xD;
rich a welcome.. She attempted to speak ; she put out her hand,&#xD;
but a flood of tears overtook her.&#xD;
"You see what a- foolish creature I am!" said she, with a&#xD;
smile of living love brightening through her tears. ".But I can-&#xD;
not help it ! such good things happeningto me, when I deserve&#xD;
them so little!"&#xD;
The gentle woman whispered a word of cheer, and glided from&#xD;
the roomu. It was an hour of deep and holy emotion to Charlotte.&#xD;
Her gratitude to God, and to the friends he had given her, arose&#xD;
to rapture; feeling, as she did, that her feet were now led into&#xD;
sweet pastures for a season, and that here she might lie down and&#xD;
rest by the cool waters.&#xD;
When next she met Mrs. Longman, her appearance had under-&#xD;
gone a surprising change. She was attired with a simplicity&#xD;
amounting almost to homeliness; but the charm of her figure, and&#xD;
the spirit of beauty and grace that breathed about her, amply&#xD;
compensated for the' lack of external adornments. She had&#xD;
dressed her hair carefully, however; and to that, perhaps, she&#xD;
owed no small part of her personal attractions. In the luxuriant&#xD;
arrangement of its rich, soft masses, she had displayed all the&#xD;
natural exultation and exuberance of her spirits. No jewel on&#xD;
her head or about her person, save a simple golden cross upon her&#xD;
neck. .It was a trifle Hector had given her, -the only gift of&#xD;
his she had consented to retain,-and this was the first occa-,&#xD;
sion on which she had worn it, since they parted.  Her counte-&#xD;
nance was tranquil and happy, yet there was a softening sadness&#xD;
in it still, which rendered it all the more winning. Her eyes were&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
TWO SKELETONS IN ONE HOUSE.              205&#xD;
wonderfully bright and melting. Mrs. Longman regarded her with&#xD;
quiet admiration.&#xD;
" And how did you leave Mrs. Dunbury ? " that lady asked.&#xD;
"I am sorry Hector has gone again. He appears to have a rov-&#xD;
ing disposition. Is -his mind.as changeable as his habits ? I am&#xD;
not much acquainted with him; I never saw him but twice, and&#xD;
that was years ago. He was then a handsome, high-spirited boy,&#xD;
-adventurous, but very-fond of his mother."&#xD;
Poor Charlotte managed to say, -&#xD;
S"He is your cousin?"&#xD;
" A sort of second cousin, -and that only by marriage. Mr.&#xD;
Longman is Mrs. Dunbury's uncle; and I am Mr. Longman's&#xD;
daughter-in-law.  I wish I knew the family better. Ah, Mrs.&#xD;
Dunbury says such blessed things of you in her letters!"&#xD;
" Her letters ! " said Charlotte.&#xD;
S"You did not know, then, that we received one from her by&#xD;
mail only a few hours before the one you brought arrived? In-&#xD;
deed, how should you know ? Perhaps it would have been as well&#xD;
not to mention it; but-it appears she could not express herself&#xD;
sufficiently in the note she had sent by you; so she afterwards,&#xD;
on her sick bed, took occasion to tell us more about you."&#xD;
"She is too kind ; you must not believe half she says."&#xD;
" One half will be enough ! - But, come, I want my mother to&#xD;
see you. She is aged, and a little capricious; she has grown quite&#xD;
impatient about you."&#xD;
The mother -or rather the mother-in-law -was an emaciated&#xD;
old lady, with an ear-trumpet, a snuff-box, and an extremely feeble,&#xD;
small voice. She proved to be very deaf, and very peevish. She&#xD;
made Charlotte sit up close to her-chair, and, giving her the mouth-&#xD;
piece of the trumpet, while she held the other extremity of the&#xD;
tube to her ear, conversed with her from the depths of the pillows&#xD;
in which her attenuated frame was almost hidden from view.&#xD;
Charlotte had been nearly a week with her new friends, when,&#xD;
one day, as she was keeping the old lady company, she was aroused&#xD;
by an occurrence in the adjoining room. The door was unclosed;&#xD;
and she heard Mrs. Longman exclaim,&#xD;

206          TWO SKELETONS IN ONE HOUSE.&#xD;
" Edward, where did you come from?"&#xD;
"From Paradise, by the- back door," replied a voice which&#xD;
made-Charlotte start, and strain her ear to catch the faintest&#xD;
intonation. "Do you know what that means ? It meas quibble-&#xD;
quabble. The world is all a fleeting show. Give me a glass of&#xD;
water.".'&#xD;
" Sit down, Edward," said the widow, kindly. " Will you take&#xD;
some wine?  You look weary."&#xD;
" I have been in the wilderness, tempted of the devil. I would&#xD;
not care; if I had not torn my trousers. - When this old hat was&#xD;
new, -sing me that hymn; I think it is something melancholy,&#xD;
tending to reflection. - .And I was young and gay,  we are older&#xD;
now, Sal ! And wiser ; did you know it?"&#xD;
" And wiser," repeated Mrs. Longman.&#xD;
"I like you, Sal !" said Edward, affectionately. "But there&#xD;
is a deal of milk-and-water in your composition." .&#xD;
"Drink the wine, Edward."&#xD;
"The milk of human kindness, and the water that delights&#xD;
thirsty souls ! That 's better than wine.  Good Sal ! you are-&#xD;
one in ten thousand. I would kiss you, but for my oath."  The&#xD;
speaker's eye glittered, and his voice sank to a whisper. "I stood&#xD;
on the shore, and saw the ship, rich-freighted with my happiness,&#xD;
sail out of sight in the distance. The Princess of Sheba's ship,_-&#xD;
did I tell you ?"&#xD;
Edward seated himself in an attitude of deep thoughtfulness,&#xD;
holding his dilapidated hat in one hand, and the glass in the other.&#xD;
His long, flaxen beard streamed down and touched the wine, as he&#xD;
bent forward, resting his elbow on his knee.  The widow stood&#xD;
by, sad and patient, waiting for him to drink.&#xD;
" Prophecy is a fearful gift." 'He raised his head, and shook&#xD;
the wine-drops from his beard. "She shall reign ; but one is to&#xD;
be sacrificed. Broken ice and water."  He seemed to be gazing&#xD;
at some picture, far away, and his finger waved softly in the air.&#xD;
"The river that flows through Sheba; 't.is perilous crossing!&#xD;
Sal !-"- starting with exultation, - "they 'ye shown me my&#xD;
epitaph ! -'T is to be written in fire, on a monument high as the&#xD;
moon !"&#xD;
&#xD;
Two SKELETONS IN ONE HOUSE.              207&#xD;
The widow came softly, and closed the door.&#xD;
"What is there?" cried the old lady, agitating her pillows.&#xD;
"Tell me ; no secrecy ! Why is the door closed?  Quick ! "&#xD;
And the feeble hand extended the mouth-piece, with an impa-&#xD;
tient jesture. Charlotte replied, through the tube, that some per-&#xD;
son was talking with Sarah.&#xD;
"Who?    Don't keep me in suspense ! I shall die ! 0, dear !&#xD;
why don't you speak?"&#xD;
" I-don't know who it is."&#xD;
" Don't know ? You must know ! You are deceiving me !&#xD;
Sarah has no right -"&#xD;
" She calls his name Edward."&#xD;
" Edward ! is he here ? Why don't he come at once to his&#xD;
mamma ? Why does she keep him ?"&#xD;
Charlotte, rising : " I will speak to her."&#xD;
" No ! " whistled the feeble voice ; "don't leave me ! I sbal-&#xD;
know nothing, if you do. They take advantage of my infirmities;&#xD;
they impose upon me in all sorts of ways. Poor Edward ! he has&#xD;
been out of his mind. 0, it 's now five years or more ! A disap-&#xD;
pointment. That was the beginning of it. So, he is home again,&#xD;
is he ?  It runs in the family, - hereditary, you know. Sarah's&#xD;
husband, Lawrence, --he was my oldest,-- committed suicide. I&#xD;
went to the garret, one day, and found him hanging from a rafter.&#xD;
I never got over the shock. It all came of his meeting an old&#xD;
flame. , They 'd been engaged, I can't remember how many years.&#xD;
He had married a new fancy; and when he saw the other again;&#xD;
they had a desperate'time. It almost killed Sarah. It 's in the&#xD;
Longman family, not in mine. Mr. Longman had a nephew who&#xD;
went the same way. A brother of Mrs. Dunbury, you know ;&#xD;
Hector's uncle. We used to think Hector would be like him,-&#xD;
how is it ?"&#xD;
Charlotte shuddered; the picture the invalid once had drawn&#xD;
of her son's possible fate recurring with startling vividness to&#xD;
her mipd. At this juncture, the widow entered the room; and&#xD;
Charlotte gave a rapid account of her meeting with Edward, in&#xD;
her northward journey.&#xD;
"What are you talking ?" cried the old lady. "Here! !"-&#xD;

giving Sprah the tube, -" tell me all about it.. Don't omit a&#xD;
word."&#xD;
"Presently," said Sarah. "Edward is coming."&#xD;
Charlotte glided out, by another 4door, as he entered. At sight&#xD;
of his haggard face and tattered clothes, the old lady began to&#xD;
weep. He regarded her compassionately.&#xD;
" The creature they used to call my mother!  How long has&#xD;
she been a weasel ? If she is hungry, give her some mice. There&#xD;
shall be no hunger in our kingdom, not even among the insignifi-&#xD;
cant races. And no tears either, except liar's tears ! "- through&#xD;
his teeth - " and they shall weep, weep, weep ! Could a princess&#xD;
tell a lie?"&#xD;
"What does he say ?" squeaked the old lady.&#xD;
" When sent for, I shall appear ; and so I told her majesty.&#xD;
Ha ! "- his countenance lighted .up, as he glanced from  the&#xD;
western window, - " the sun sets red ; there is danger brooding&#xD;
for to-morrow ! "&#xD;
"Tell me, quick ! Here ! " - the old lady agitated her tube,,&#xD;
-" Edward, speak to your poor mamma!"&#xD;
' I strode that-sun once, and rode him through the heavens till&#xD;
I bumped my head against the darkness !  Sal! "- pointing&#xD;
eagerly at the sky,-" do you inark the phantom horseman?  He&#xD;
galnops through a sea of fire !"&#xD;
"Kiss me, my boy!" whimpered the old lady.&#xD;
"Since Christmas, I have seen five, - brave riders all ! One&#xD;
swims the wave on a dolphin; that 's Cupid. One scours through&#xD;
the bowels of the earth; that 's Avarice. And one careers on the&#xD;
mountains ; that 's Ambition. ^This one is nameless ; but where&#xD;
he rides men's wits are troubled."&#xD;
Already ,a domestic had been despatched for Mr. Longman-&#xD;
He was not far from home; he returned speedily ; and finding&#xD;
his son in so unusual a state, he sent in haste for the family&#xD;
physician.&#xD;
Sleep, said the doctor, was chiefly necessary to restore Edward's&#xD;
mind and body to their ordinary condition. But he could not be&#xD;
prevailed upon to take any repose-.&#xD;

have been strangers. What if her majesty sends, and finds me&#xD;
napping?"&#xD;
Neither reason nor entreaty could influence him. He walked&#xD;
the room restless, talking wildly. At length Sarah suggested that&#xD;
Charlotte should be invited to exert her power. The others con-&#xD;
sented ; and presently the "princess" appeared.&#xD;
Was it his imagination only, or something in the magnetism of&#xD;
her gentle spirit, that wrought so wonderful a change in his entire&#xD;
demeanor?   His countenance grew placid;, his movements less&#xD;
sharp and abrupt ; his eye less wild and glaring ; he became obe-&#xD;
dient and tractable as a child. The same extreme sensitiveness to&#xD;
personal influences, that caused him to start and shudder at the&#xD;
approach of impure spheres, seemed also to have revealed to him&#xD;
some innate excellence in Charlotte, to which he owed allegiance.&#xD;
At her request, he consented first to take a warm bath, then to be&#xD;
put to bed ; and, having exacted her promise that she would have&#xD;
him waked, without fail, before the ship sailed, he closed his eyes,&#xD;
and soon sank into a profound, perspiring sleep.&#xD;
"A visitor to see Miss Woods," said tle widow, in the forenoon&#xD;
of the next day, showing her benign countenance in Charlotte's&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
" Me ! " echoed Charlotte, turning pale.&#xD;
A rapid train of thought passed through her mind. Robert&#xD;
Greenwich, returning to Huntersford, and learning the address of&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury's relatives in Canada, had hastened to trace her to&#xD;
her last place of refuge. It was what she had feared. But Mrs.&#xD;
Longman relieved her with the welcome intelligence that the vis-&#xD;
itor was a lady.&#xD;
"0, Mrs. Sperkley ! " said Charlotte.&#xD;
"What a time I have had finding you!" exclaimed the little&#xD;
woman.   "It{'s curious, as I said to my husband, that I never&#xD;
thought to ask your address. I 'd forgotten Mr. Longman's name,&#xD;
too; and, just think ! the very next day after you had gone, a&#xD;
young gentleman, who says he has something of great importance&#xD;
for you, came to inquire about you."&#xD;
" A young gentleman ! Who ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"I declare, I can't speak his name ! Strange, for him and my&#xD;
husband got very intimate, and played billiards together, and I&#xD;
don't know what all."&#xD;
"Does he wear a moustache-?"&#xD;
"0, yes, a very handsome one !"&#xD;
"Is n't he the same person who was detained from the steam.&#xD;
boat by the insane man?"&#xD;
" 0, yes !"cried the duchess-; "and I thought I had seen his&#xD;
face somewhere. But, then, I should think he 'd have spoken of&#xD;
it. The way he found us was queer.   He could n't see your&#xD;
name on any of the hotel books ; so, when he saw our arrival reg.&#xD;
istered as Mr. Sperkley, lady, and friend, he thought you must be&#xD;
the friend."&#xD;
" And - where is he now ?"&#xD;
" 0," said the duchess, "him and my husband has gone down&#xD;
to Quebec together, on some kind of a speculation. My husband&#xD;
is a great speculator; he trades in watches, and di'monds, and&#xD;
all sorts of things. Well, when I was left all alone, and did n't&#xD;
know what else to do with myself, what should I find in my work-&#xD;
box but the very card MiLongman sent up to us the day he came&#xD;
to the hotel. And what did I do, but give it to the landlord, and&#xD;
tell him to find out where such a man lived. That was easy ; and&#xD;
here I am. I knew you would be glad to see me ; for I said to&#xD;
myself, says I, though may be she won't care much about me,&#xD;
she '11 be pleased to hear from the young gentleman. 0, I re-&#xD;
member his name, now ! It 's Sandwich, or Wolwich, or some-&#xD;
thing of the kind. It 's some sort of a wich, any way. You may&#xD;
depend upon seeing him just as soon as he gets back with my hus-&#xD;
band. You know what he has for you a great deal better than&#xD;
I do."&#xD;
"IWhatever it is," said Charlotte, with sparkling eyes, "I do&#xD;
not wish to receive it ! "&#xD;
" You don't say !" cried the astonished duchess.&#xD;
"It was expressly to prevent his finding me that I requested&#xD;
your husband not to register my arrival on the books of the hotel.&#xD;
And I hope," added Charlotte, almost weeping with vexation,&#xD;
&#xD;
TWO SKELETONS IN ONE SOUSE.             211&#xD;
" that you will not do me so unwelcome a kindness as to send me&#xD;
any such friends."&#xD;
" Why, I am sure, I can't understand that !"&#xD;
" No, I do not expect you to. Do not try to; do not think of&#xD;
it any more ; do not think of me. I have felt very grateful for&#xD;
your kindness to me ; but I- beg you will not give yourself any&#xD;
more trouble on my account."&#xD;
In a little while the duchess took her leave. Charlotte did&#xD;
not invite her to call again; and, as she saw her ride smilingly&#xD;
away in the cab, she devoutly hoped that the light of that beam-&#xD;
ing face uiight never shine upon her pathway again.&#xD;
&#xD;

XXIII.&#xD;
PROSPECTS&#xD;
THus Charlotte had found not only two skeletons in Mr. Long-&#xD;
man's house, but there was a fine promise of another coming,; for&#xD;
in truth she placed so little confidence in Mrs. Sperkley's discre-&#xD;
tion, that she expected nothing more than to see Mr. Robert&#xD;
Greenwich, immediately on his return from Quebec with the trav-&#xD;
elling watch-trader.&#xD;
In the mean time, her friends had succeeded in finding a posi-&#xD;
tion for her as a companion to a wealthy dowager. The news&#xD;
was imparted to her immediately after the departure of the&#xD;
duchess. It only remained for her to see the lady, and, if they&#xD;
were mutually pleased with each other, to accept the situation.&#xD;
The following day was fixed for the interview.&#xD;
Mrs. De Tohan was a person of benevolent aspect and mild&#xD;
address.  Charlotte entered her presence with fear and trem.&#xD;
bling,; but a smile reassured her; she was delighted with the&#xD;
thought of attending upon so kind a lady; and her only appre-&#xD;
hension now was, that her services might not be accepted.&#xD;
"I see but one difficulty in the way," observed the dowager.&#xD;
" You say the more quiet and retired your life, the better. Now,&#xD;
I intend soon to commence a series of jOurneys, which will termi-&#xD;
nate in the good Old Country, in the course of a year or two; and&#xD;
I shall expect you to accompany me."&#xD;
Charlotte's pulse leaped with joy. With nothing to bind&#xD;
her to the past but ties that her spirit longed to sever, it is no.&#xD;
wonder. that she reached out the eager hand of welcome to&#xD;
the future smiling from the cloud which had darkened before&#xD;
her. so long.&#xD;
&#xD;
PROSPECTS.                    213&#xD;
Yet the joy was tempered with deep and saddening thoughts;&#xD;
and may we not guess that the image of one she loved rose tram-&#xD;
ulously before her then?&#xD;
That night Charlotte dreamed of Hector. She went with Mrs.&#xD;
De Rohan to San Francisco, where she found him waiting for her&#xD;
under some door-yard trees, which bore a remarkable resem-&#xD;
blance to those in front of his father's house. His voice and&#xD;
smile were real; and all things glowed with a happy blue-and-&#xD;
golden light,-except the weather, which Charlotte found very&#xD;
cold. It was so cold that she awoke ; when she discovered the&#xD;
fresh morning air blowing upon her bed.   She had left .her&#xD;
window partly open, on retiring, and the wind had changed during&#xD;
the night.&#xD;
So much for her dream; but all that morning Hector's image&#xD;
haunted her; and she chided herself, not only for thinking of&#xD;
him, but for entertaining such fancies even in a dream.&#xD;
Mr. Longman sent for her to visit his unfortunate son.&#xD;
"He has somehow conceived the notion that you are going to&#xD;
desert him," said the old gentleman, in his subdued voice. " You&#xD;
alone have any influence with him; and I -have faith to think&#xD;
that, if you would consent to remain with us, his reason might be&#xD;
restored. I know what a sacrifice it will be for you-; but, if grat-&#xD;
itude can repay you-"&#xD;
. Tears blurred. Mr. Longman's vision; .his white eyelashes&#xD;
winked them away, but he had forgotten just what he was saying,&#xD;
and failed to complete the sentence. His words troubled Char-&#xD;
lotte ; and, having paid Edward a visit, and rendered him quiet&#xD;
and obedient to the wishes of his friends, she withdrew to her&#xD;
chamber to consider what it was her duty to do.&#xD;
The-'engagement with Mrs. De Rohan seemed too advantageous&#xD;
to be abandoned. It promised freedom and a new life.  On the&#xD;
other hand, if she could work a vital benefit to any fellow unfor-&#xD;
tunate, was the opportunity to be neglected?&#xD;
She determined to dismiss the subject from her thoughts until&#xD;
the following day, and sat down *to write a letter to Mrs. Dun-&#xD;
bury. ~he had not finished. the sheet, when a servant appeared,&#xD;
to inform her that there was a gentleman below, waiting to see&#xD;
&#xD;

214                     PROSPECTS.&#xD;
her. She could scarce refrain from uttering a cry of distress;&#xD;
but instantly her mind was made up; she determined not to go&#xD;
down.&#xD;
" He did not give his name," said the servant.&#xD;
" It was unnecessary," replied Charlotte. "No gentleman&#xD;
would call on me whom I wish to see to-day. Say to him, I am&#xD;
engaged."   '   -&#xD;
Sheewas- incensed against hersf because Robert Greenwich&#xD;
still had power to unstring her nerves, and quicken the movements&#xD;
of her timid heart. She did not know how agitated she was&#xD;
until the servant had disappeared, and she once more took up&#xD;
her pen to write. In a moment, the subject she had been&#xD;
weighing in her mind that morning was decided. "I will go with&#xD;
Mrs. De Rohan. Then let him follow me to the ends of the&#xD;
earth, if he will ! "&#xD;
The servant reappeared. " The gentleman's compliments ;&#xD;
and if Miss Woods is engaged, he will wait in the parlor until&#xD;
she is "ready to see him."&#xD;
"What effrontery ! Let him wait, then ! -No!" she exclaimed,&#xD;
calling the -servant-back ; " I will. go down!"&#xD;
Five-minutes later, she entered the parlor. Her color' was&#xD;
heightened ; an expression of pain and dread was written upon&#xD;
her brow; but her large eyes beamed with a clear and steady&#xD;
light, and her step, her carriage, and the curving of her mouth,&#xD;
were queenly.&#xD;
She turned to the: corner where the visitor stood. He had&#xD;
been pacing the floor, and on her entrance had halted where she&#xD;
found him; but, after a moment's hesitation, he advanced and sank&#xD;
upon his knee at her feet.&#xD;
"Charlotte !" breathed a voice whose tones thrilled in every&#xD;
fibre of her frame.&#xD;
"Hector !-" she cried out, in wild and eager surprise ; then&#xD;
turning with a gesture of despair, she fell forward upon the sofa,&#xD;
hiding her face from his sight.'&#xD;
He went and stood by her side. He bent over rher, putting&#xD;
aside the curls from her cheek. He knelt again and !issed the&#xD;
&#xD;
PROSPECTS.                    215&#xD;
hand that hung over the arm of the sofa. His very touch&#xD;
betrayed the tumult in his breast.&#xD;
"Speak to me !'look at me ! Why do you turn from me so?"&#xD;
" I, thought," she said, in a stifled and broken voice, " I&#xD;
thought you were -- another !"&#xD;
" Perhaps, then, had you known, you would not have deigned&#xD;
to see me! "&#xD;
" Yes; I will be plain and. true with you. I would, but I&#xD;
should have been prepared; I should not have been surprised by&#xD;
this weakness."&#xD;
"You had no presentiment, ever so shadowy and vague, that&#xD;
I would come ?"&#xD;
"None ! ' exclaimed Charlotte; "or, if I had, I dismissed it&#xD;
as the vainest dream of my life."&#xD;
Hector seated himself, and laid his hand upon her arm with a&#xD;
touch that thrilled her still. " Tell me, Charlotte, are you not&#xD;
conscious of an influence that chains you to me, and me to you,&#xD;
inevitably? Go down into the deepest and purest waters of your&#xD;
heart, and find the response !"&#xD;
"If ever I thought so," answered Charlotte, " then I was&#xD;
deceived."&#xD;
"I believe in one only great and overmastering love ! " said&#xD;
Hector. " By its magnetism soul is bound with soul, as sphere&#xD;
to sphere in the heavens. It has an astrology of its own, that&#xD;
reveals heart to heart at any distances. If in my wanderings&#xD;
from you I have not felt your spirit following me, and drawing&#xD;
me back,-if when furthest from you I have not been with you,&#xD;
and you with me, continually, -then there is no wisdom or virtue&#xD;
in me !"&#xD;
"0 , but when I told you my history, your love was not proof&#xD;
against that ! You said it placed life and death between us.&#xD;
You left me withe those words. I did not blame you: but, if you&#xD;
felt so once, you will again. I should not dare, I should not&#xD;
dare, after that -"&#xD;
-" I am not here," responded Hector's deep and earnest tones,&#xD;
" to make weak excuses for weak conduct. I acted then only as&#xD;
he whom you knew as'-Hector could act. Trial and absence were&#xD;
&#xD;

216                    PROSPECTS.&#xD;
necessary to self-knowledge. The moment you were shut from&#xD;
my sight, I saw the stupendous  folly, the guilt, of sacrificing all&#xD;
that could make true happiness for me on earth, to the paltry&#xD;
considerations of expediency. I had sold my birthright for a mess&#xD;
of pottage. I'. had given love, the life of my life, to fatten an&#xD;
unworthy pride. One day I visited a public show, and saw&#xD;
living doves put into the cages of serpents. I recognized the&#xD;
image of my own sin. I had been feeding my doves to serpents!&#xD;
For days the picture was before me; it haunted my sleep; I&#xD;
awoke in groans of aqtny from the horror of the dream. I had&#xD;
no respite, until I had slain the serpents. I rescued the doves  I&#xD;
opened the cage, - and all with one accord flew joyously through&#xD;
the clear heaven of my soul to you! Now, call me-changeable,&#xD;
if you will; reproach me for the wrong I did you; but here I am,&#xD;
obedient, not to any caprice, not to inclination or passion merely,&#xD;
but to the deepest convictions and holiest promptings of my&#xD;
nature ! "&#xD;
Charlotte looked in his eyes. They were pure as the unclouded&#xD;
heavens. They filled her with such strange and perilous-sensa-&#xD;
tions, tiat, alarmed at herself, she turned away.&#xD;
" But the serpents-I will never give them cause to turn their&#xD;
rage against me ! "&#xD;
"If they had not been killed, I should not be here," said Hec-&#xD;
tor. "What pledge can I give you?   I know of none but that&#xD;
of a life devoted henceforth to you!"&#xD;
"And that I cannot, you know I cannot accept ! Do not&#xD;
torture 'me more! Think of what I am ; think of yourself!&#xD;
Remember your mother, too, she who is so proud of you!"&#xD;
"If her pride is a true pride," said Hector, with noble enthu-&#xD;
siasm,-" she will rejoice that her son had the courage to set his&#xD;
heel upon prejudice and conventionality, and stand by your side,&#xD;
in the face of the world."&#xD;
Your heart is too generous   replied Charlotte, in a calm,&#xD;
low voice. "Such sentiments cannot be taken into the world&#xD;
and live. An impassable gulf divide's us; I feel it, if you do .&#xD;
riot ; and I shudder when you draw me to the brinkk"&#xD;
&#xD;
PROSPECTS.                    217&#xD;
Hector had expected opposition, but nothing like this. She&#xD;
spoke in: fearful earnest ; and he knew it.&#xD;
" If you tell me this because you do not love me, I am satis-&#xD;
fied. I will not plead one moment. But it is you, now, who&#xD;
are untrue, both to yourself and me."&#xD;
She faltered, and her tears fell. He took her in his arms, and&#xD;
she sobbed aloud. It was a moment of intense suffering, suffused&#xD;
with an indefinable happiness, which his mere presence shed&#xD;
about her like dew. But she hastened to recover herself, and&#xD;
put him gently from her.&#xD;
"If you did not know your power over me, at least you know&#xD;
it now ! " she said, with touching pathos. " But, if you are gen-&#xD;
erous, you will not use it, Whatever weakness I may show, my&#xD;
resolution is unmoved. My future is already planned."&#xD;
She spoke of her engagement with Mrs. De Rohan. The&#xD;
reviving joypusness with which she expressed her anticipations of&#xD;
crossing the ocean, and of thus embracing a destiny in which he&#xD;
had no share, filled Hector with insupportable pain. But' when&#xD;
she added that she had not forgotten that England was his father-&#xD;
land, and that when there she should think of him often, he&#xD;
sprang impetuously to his feet.&#xD;
"Often ! indeed ! I have no more to say ! I might be satisfied&#xD;
with often! Henceforth my lips are sealed ! 0, Charlotte-"&#xD;
He paused; the younger Mrs. Longman was at the door.&#xD;
Hector explained to his relative, with his customary frankness,&#xD;
that he had not come to Montreal on a visit.&#xD;
" On arriving home, two nights ago, I learned that Miss Woods&#xD;
had deserted my mother. She was languishing, in her absence ;&#xD;
said I, 'I will follow, and bring her back.' But she has made&#xD;
different arrangements, and all that remains for me is to return&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
At this crisis, a note was handed in " for Miss Woods' The&#xD;
eagerness with which she opened 'and read it did not escape&#xD;
Hector's jealous eye. He judged it to be from Mrs. De Rohan.&#xD;
He was not mistaken; it was a request for Charlotte to call uponr&#xD;
her that morning.&#xD;

" How long will you be gone?" asked Mrs. Longman.&#xD;
" Possibly a greater part of the day. I can walk," said Char.&#xD;
lotte; "i is not far, and I need the exercise."&#xD;
hIt is too 'fhr," said the widow.  " Hector shall carry you in&#xD;
the chaise."S&#xD;
Charlotte left the room. She was absent near half an hour,&#xD;
when, returning, with her bonnet and shawl, she placed a letter&#xD;
in Hector's hand.er&#xD;
"If you will give that to your mother -" Her voice was&#xD;
tremulous, her eyes fell, and Hector saw that in her hand she&#xD;
held another-letter, which she hesitated to give him.&#xD;
I am going with you," he said. "If you prefer to walk, we&#xD;
will walk; but the chaise is at the door."&#xD;
"As you please," responded Charlotte.&#xD;
"Do you remember our first ride together," he asked,' as he&#xD;
helped her into the chaise. " And the catastrophe, Charlotte?&#xD;
- when you clung to my arm, and our souls knew each other, in&#xD;
the hour of danger?  0, what a life-time 'twixt then and now!&#xD;
Then and now !" he repeated, as they rode away. "0, strange,&#xD;
strange experience ! And you - you-"    -&#xD;
sApassion of grief seemed bursting in his voice; but he checked&#xD;
it, and fixed his features firm, and drove on in silence.&#xD;
" We are close by Mrs. De Rohan's house," said Charlotte, at&#xD;
length. " Speak to me one last kind word, which it will be&#xD;
pleasant to remember, if I should not see you again, will you&#xD;
not ?&#xD;
"Charlotte !" exclaimed Hector, "we do not part so! You do&#xD;
not know in what an abyss I feel myself sinking at the thought&#xD;
of it. All my bitter-and-sweet experience up to this hour serves&#xD;
but to make a separation unendurable. And now --now - to,&#xD;
have your own choice decide against me, to see you depart free&#xD;
al joyous in the pathway of a new existence, in which I have no&#xD;
part; it makesmy brain whirl, and my heart burst ! Charlotte !&#xD;
it cannot be !"&#xD;
."You misunderstand me !" said Charlotte ; " but I cannot&#xD;
answer lyou now. I must stop here. This is the house."-&#xD;
" The house will wait for us half an hour."&#xD;
&#xD;
PROSPECTS.                     219&#xD;
"No; I will stop now. If you wish to see me again, come,&#xD;
and I will ride back with you."&#xD;
" Give me that letter you have for me, and I will."&#xD;
" I wrote it when I did not expect to'see you again ; but, since&#xD;
you, are to call for me "&#xD;
The letter!" exclaimed Hector. She gave it to him. He&#xD;
accompanied her to the door ; she entered, and, returning to the&#xD;
chaise, he hid himself in the corner of the seat, and read the&#xD;
letter.&#xD;
It was the sweetest and yet bitterest morsel his eyes had ever&#xD;
devoured. In the first half Charlotte had expressed a depth, a&#xD;
purity, and intensity of love, in words which came all alive and&#xD;
glowing from  her soul.  But in the concluding portion she&#xD;
expressed an irrevocable decision to fulfil her engagement with&#xD;
Mrs. De Rohan, and stated peremptory reasons that forbade the&#xD;
very thought of a union with Hector. One page he kissed with&#xD;
passionate fervor ; the' other he struck and crushed, in the torture&#xD;
which it inflicted. He was still tormenting himself in this man-&#xD;
ner, when Charlotte reappeared. They rode, on for some dis-&#xD;
tance in silence.&#xD;
"Well," said lector, at length, "tell me !"&#xD;
" I cannot tell you what you want me to," replied Charlotte.&#xD;
"You still hold to the decision expressed in this letter?"&#xD;
A tremulous "Yes ' was the response. "Will you give it back&#xD;
to me ?" added Charlotte.&#xD;
Hector took the letter, and, tearing off the last page, scattered&#xD;
it in fragments upon Charlotte's lap.&#xD;
" That part is unworthy of you! The rest is dear to me, and&#xD;
I shall keep it."&#xD;
Another silence. Charlotte gathered up the fragments, and&#xD;
destroyed them.&#xD;
" Hector," she{said, at length, "I am not going with Mrs. De&#xD;
Rohan."  Joy leaped in Hector's heart.  ".Because I cannot,"&#xD;
added Charlotte. " Even Providence seems working against me!&#xD;
She has received letters which have decided her to go south, and&#xD;
spen4 the winter with a brother in Mobile."&#xD;
&#xD;

220                     PROSPECTS.&#xD;
At dinner, that day, Hector appeared in his best mood. His&#xD;
cheerfulness, his simple and sweet wisdom, his flashing wit, and&#xD;
the soft splendor of his eye, charmed his relatives. The welcome&#xD;
intelligence that Charlotte would probably remain in the family&#xD;
had rendered them susceptible to the influence ; and their appre-&#xD;
ciation drew. Hector on. .-Their sympathy filled the cup that over-&#xD;
flowed again to them. And the fact that Charlotte was herself a&#xD;
listener was to his mind as morning to the lark. For her it sang&#xD;
its loftiest strain, and beat with its joyous wings the golden lattice&#xD;
of heaven. No matter what the conversation was: the topics&#xD;
were various, but every theme he touched, however lowly, -like&#xD;
troughs and swine in the landscape of the artist, - received -a&#xD;
ray of the Supreme Beauty. All ,this without any, pedantry or&#xD;
display ; but his imagination shed its radiance as it passed, as&#xD;
naturally as the sun. Charlotte never spoke ; but, troubled, trem-&#xD;
bling, happy, her spirit drew near and sat at his feet to listen.&#xD;
After dinner she could not refrain from thanking him for teaching&#xD;
her so much.&#xD;
" I never heard even you," she said, "talk like that before."&#xD;
" Because," replied Hector, "when you knew me before, I had&#xD;
not lived the life I have lived since. If we would utter a truth,&#xD;
we must first make it ours by deed and experience."&#xD;
Charlotte pondered. Hector was indeed changed. Surely he&#xD;
had set his feet upon chains that fettered him before. A sweet&#xD;
voice within her whispered that here was truth to be trusted, -&#xD;
that here was indeed a noble and heroic love. Had she done&#xD;
justice to herself and him?  Was it right that the words he had&#xD;
uttered that morning, thrilling her so, should be turned away, like&#xD;
singing children, from the door of her heart, because she was&#xD;
fearful of thieves ? 0, too delicious thought, that they might be&#xD;
entertained in the innermost chamber of love's fond belief !&#xD;
&#xD;
xxIy.&#xD;
THE JUDGMENT.&#xD;
THA evening, Hector and Charlotte sat conversing in the&#xD;
parlor; Mrs. Longman had withdrawn, and they were left alone.&#xD;
The clock struck nine.&#xD;
" How the hours fly!" said Hector. "The door-bell takes up&#xD;
the echo,-unwelcome sound !--but, as there can be no persons&#xD;
for us, we will forestall an interruption."&#xD;
He led the way to a small side-room communicating with the&#xD;
parlor. Scarce had they passed the door, when a servant&#xD;
announced "A gentleman to see Miss Woods."    Both started,&#xD;
and murmured, simultaneously, a hated name.&#xD;
"Shall I see him? " asked Charlotte.&#xD;
" As well now as ever," replied Hector.&#xD;
A brief delay was necessary for Charlotte to collect her&#xD;
thoughts, and summon strength for the interview. Then, calm,&#xD;
composed, filled with a deep, unruffled happiness, which she had&#xD;
drawn from Hector's presence and sympathy, she entered the par-&#xD;
lor and stood before the visitor, waiting for him to speak.&#xD;
" You will not take my hand?"&#xD;
No word or motion in reply; brit she-looked down upon him&#xD;
from her serene height, as if he had been a worm.&#xD;
"Nor speak to me?" added the visitor, with a struggling des-&#xD;
peration in his tone.&#xD;
The recoiling disgust, the unutterable scorn and pride, with&#xD;
which she regarded him, was her sole response.&#xD;
"My God ! " groaned Robert, in a burst of passion, "I am the&#xD;
most wretched of men ! If you would do me a kindness, strike&#xD;
that into my heart ! "&#xD;

222    f..THE JUDGMENT.&#xD;
He threw himself upon his knees, and, springing open the long,&#xD;
bright Jlade of a dirk-knife, placed its handle in her hand A&#xD;
-lade'h                                    a'd&#xD;
wild impulse seized Charlotte; she grasped the weapon. Robert&#xD;
saw the fire kindle in her eye. Her features darkened and con-&#xD;
tracted ; and the next moment, the point was at his breast.&#xD;
"mDo not hesitate.! It is the least cruel thing you have done to&#xD;
me, --,strike! "&#xD;
Charlotte flung the weapon behind her, on the floor.&#xD;
"Arise!" she commanded ; " I pity you !"&#xD;
Robert fell upon his face, and ground his teeth. Suddenly he'&#xD;
started up, and, with looks of fury, rushed to clutch the knife.&#xD;
But it had disappeared.&#xD;
" Give it me ! -I will end myself! "&#xD;
"Poor wretch!" said Charlotte, "you know not what you do!&#xD;
Why are you here?"&#xD;
"Because it is my destiny! because I am condemned, and&#xD;
driven, lashed and chained, to this torment!  Mrs. Sperkley&#xD;
told me of you, and made me promise not to come; you see how&#xD;
easily I broke my word! It is not because I am apt -at per'ury;&#xD;
but my love is overwhelming, I am no more my own master. I&#xD;
knew you would scorn me. You have seen in me,- you see in&#xD;
me --only the villain ; and villain enough I was, and am God&#xD;
knows! But my love for you has been my greatest fault. It has&#xD;
prompted me to seize you, to hold you, to make you mine for-*&#xD;
ever, at all hazards ! Had Hector's possessed half the intensity of.&#xD;
mine, he could never have deserted you; he would be now at your&#xD;
feet;"                                                    -&#xD;
"0 -shameful!" exclaimed Charlott  -"-to call your base-&#xD;
ness love, to compare yourself with him!- a reptile to an eagle !-&#xD;
when no one act of yours, in all your dealings with me, has been&#xD;
prompted by aught but the most utter and eager selfishness ! And&#xD;
now, to speak of LovE ! "&#xD;
Robert's frame shook. "The conviction that I have brought&#xD;
all this upon myself fills me with red-hot rage ! I might have&#xD;
made you my wife, - but a cursed pride restrained me;-and so&#xD;
appeared all unworthy, as indeed I was!' But, since I wold&#xD;
now repair that error -"--&#xD;
&#xD;
THE JUDGMENT.                    223&#xD;
"Speak not of what you might have done, or of what you would&#xD;
do now! If ever I felt gratitude towards you, I now feel only&#xD;
abhorrence and pity ! If this is what you came to hear, it is said,&#xD;
--Ican say no more. - -Go!"&#xD;
Robert's face was tortured and dark, his teeth and lips were&#xD;
closed, and his impure eyes burned redly, as he turned and looked&#xD;
around him. Half-stunned, struggling with some inward fury, he&#xD;
seemed to know not what to do. Charlotte left him so, and&#xD;
returned towards the side-room; but, seeing her form about to&#xD;
disappear, he sprang after her, and clasped her hand. With an&#xD;
exclamation of. loathing, she flung him off, in the strength of her&#xD;
roused spirit, as if he had been a viper.&#xD;
"No ! . no!" he muttered, with fierce determination, pressing&#xD;
towards her again. "I will sooner kill you, and die myself, than&#xD;
leave you so!"&#xD;
But his arm suddenly fell from her, as if it had been paralyzed.&#xD;
His face grew white.&#xD;
" Here is your silly toy," said Hector, displaying the dirk ;&#xD;
" and thus do I defeat your villany !" snapping the blade in twain.&#xD;
"But that I shrink from soiling my hands, I could not resist the&#xD;
impulse to hurl you from the window."&#xD;
Charlotte trembled with a sort of fearful pride in Hector's power.&#xD;
His address was princely; calm and gracious, yet in its meaning&#xD;
terrible. Still Robert shrank ; even his characteristic audacity&#xD;
failed him then,&#xD;
" Your prophecy has come true," he said, with a pallid smile.&#xD;
" We have met."&#xD;
" But we have not parted ! " answered Hector._. " We have an&#xD;
account together, which may as welfrbe settled now."&#xD;
"The sooner the better !" said Robert, doggedly.&#xD;
A dark and heavy score is marked against your name, Robert&#xD;
Greenwich ! 'Twould take too long to read you every item, but&#xD;
the sum total is -VILLANY!"&#xD;
"How have I wronged you?"&#xD;
"low have you wronged me? 0, outrage against reason!&#xD;
How have you wronged right and truth ? How have you wronged&#xD;
her? ?"- and Hector brought Charlotte face to face with him,&#xD;

224                  THE JUDGMENT.&#xD;
and looked at both. It was like an angel standing before a fiend,&#xD;
and accusing him only by the brightness of purity shining in her&#xD;
face. A lurid vengeance gathered in Robert's visage.&#xD;
But that I disdain excuses, I could, by one word, acquit&#xD;
-myself towards her ! " -&#xD;
Hector smiled : "By all means, speak that word; for, by the&#xD;
same, we may restore lustre to the blackened characters of St. Judas&#xD;
and St. Herod !"&#xD;
" You are duped ! " said Robert. " She has been careful not&#xD;
to tell you what she was - and what I did for her. I will tell&#xD;
you! "- and a devilish exultation gleamed in his eyes. " She&#xD;
was - she is -&#xD;
A swift buffet from Hector's palm shattered the word upon his&#xD;
lips. He reeled back against the marble chimney. Charlotte&#xD;
grew pale; but Hector stood calm and smiling before his quiver-&#xD;
ing antagonist.&#xD;
,"Nay, do not clinch your fist, and bite your teeth! I could&#xD;
trample you in the dust ! 0, villain ! dolt ! if, in your ignorance&#xD;
of her and me, you imagined I had not heard, from her own&#xD;
true lips, all you would have told me, and more, you rested your&#xD;
purpose of revenge upon foundations false and rotten as your own&#xD;
heart-! "&#xD;
"This blow," uttered Robert, in accents thick and hoarse, the&#xD;
slow blood trickling from his lips, -." 'twill be revenged ! "&#xD;
Revenge it now: I stand before you! But beware! there is&#xD;
a mine of danger in my soul! Take heed hoW your rash feet&#xD;
approach                             .e   o   ou   ahfe&#xD;
Robert fumed and choked. "0, you can bluster!&#xD;
by                                        you can&#xD;
boast! .but -  he smiled a ghastly smile -" we shall meet&#xD;
again! "&#xD;
"If you desire the happiness, after we part, this night," said&#xD;
Hector, " amen! but we shall see."&#xD;
" Yes - we shall see ! You know me ! " said Robert. "I do&#xD;
not forget; I do not sleep upon an injury. Indeed, we shall&#xD;
see ! "-&#xD;
He moved towards the door. Hector stepped before him.&#xD;
" Not yet ! - Charlotte, go out and lock us in ! We can settle&#xD;
this business best alone."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE JUDGMENT.                     225&#xD;
There is no key," said Charlotte, pale with apprehension, -&#xD;
"and there are persons in the hall!"&#xD;
"You mean to stop me?" cried Robert.&#xD;
"Touch but your hand to me, if you would know how well I&#xD;
man it! -Charlotte, stay!  One word while we are together.&#xD;
There was an affair of a letter. It was somewhat mysterious, and&#xD;
Mr. Greenwich shall explain."&#xD;
Stand from the door," said Robert, "or I will not speak one&#xD;
word."&#xD;
Smiling, and with folded arms, Hector stepped aside. But his&#xD;
eye was alert, and fixed like an eagle's on Robert.&#xD;
"If it is the letter troubles you so much," faltered the latter,&#xD;
"I pretended to have received one, it is true. She will tell you&#xD;
that she gave me no opportunity to set her right upon that point;&#xD;
else I should have done so.&#xD;
"Before her, then, you confess there was no letter?"&#xD;
"I took an old one, by chance, from my pocket. It was the&#xD;
caprice of a moment, -to try its effect, -not to deceive her."&#xD;
"An old one you took by chance from your pocket(" repeated&#xD;
Hector. " A momentary caprice ! The artifice was not precon-&#xD;
ceived! Do I understand?"&#xD;
" Is not my word enough.&#xD;
"No ! Falsehood can go no further ! Look you here ! "&#xD;
And the evidence of Robert's guilt was displayed, in faithful&#xD;
black-and-white, before his astonished eyes. Hector struck the&#xD;
paper.&#xD;
"A momentary capTice ! an unpremeditated artifice ! an old&#xD;
chance letter!  There is my name, attached to-an infamous slan-&#xD;
der! To debase me in her sight,, to drive her to despair, you&#xD;
invented this device. Shift and turn now as you will, - you are&#xD;
in my power, and at my mercy!"&#xD;
Robert's face was of a cowardly hue; but a stubborn pride sus-&#xD;
tamed him, and he answered, sullenly,&#xD;
"Well, sir, make the most of it !"&#xD;
"For the truth's sake, I will!  Now, go, if you wis    T&#xD;
shall go with you. In this house I am a visitor ; I do not care&#xD;
to make it the scene of further disturbance, and I know not what&#xD;

226.                 THE JUDGMENT.&#xD;
may arrive. There is your hat, which you had forgotten, in your&#xD;
recent haste."&#xD;
Hector stepped to the side-room. Charlotte followed him,&#xD;
alarmed.&#xD;
" Do not go out with him!" she pleaded.&#xD;
" Where is your faith? " said Hector. " I have a solemn les-&#xD;
son for that man, which can be taught only beneath the stars.&#xD;
Fear nothing."&#xD;
It was easy to say, have faith, and do not fear! But when&#xD;
Charlotte saw the despair and mortal hate in Robert's face, as he&#xD;
went forth, she trembled. Hector pressed her hand at the door,&#xD;
which she held open, and, flinging his cloak about him, walked on&#xD;
by Robert's side. It was a dreary street. The night was dark,&#xD;
and the wind whistled; they had soon passed from sight, and the&#xD;
echo of their footsteps died away.&#xD;
&#xD;
xxv.&#xD;
TOWARDS MIDNIGHT.&#xD;
CHARLOTTE remained some minutes at the door. The old trees&#xD;
before the house groaned, and creaked, and tossed their desolate,&#xD;
naked arms, in the blast. The thin, white moon was setting;&#xD;
phantom clouds careered in the sky; the startled stars seemed&#xD;
flying from their spheres. The apparition of a dim, gliding4gure,&#xD;
skulking away as she gazed, served to heighten Charlotte's appre-&#xD;
hensions. It disappeared in the direction Hector and Robert had&#xD;
taken. Could it be an accomplice of the latter? She ventured&#xD;
out upon the steps; but she strained her eyes in vain to penetrate&#xD;
the darkness, and she shrank back breathless into the hall.&#xD;
How fearful, at such times, it is to sit alone and wait ! How&#xD;
the ear throbs to catch every sound ; how awful the silence; how&#xD;
dreary the moan of the wind ! Charlotte, alone in the parlor,&#xD;
listened till the air seemed all alive with invisible intelligences,&#xD;
that hovered to and fro, that groaned in the chimney, that sighed&#xD;
beneath the tables, that ticked in the wall, that clattered at the&#xD;
casement, and tapped, with elfish laughter, on the panes. Twice&#xD;
she thought she heard distant pistol-shots. An hour dragged by,&#xD;
each moment heaping its weight tipon her anxious mind. Two&#xD;
hours elapsed. Surely, surely, some evil had arrived to Hector;&#xD;
else he would return. She divided the time 'twixt gazing from&#xD;
the window, listening at the door, walking nervously up and&#xD;
down, and lying upon the sofa, with her face buried in her hanss.&#xD;
She was on the point of seeking the family, to inform them of&#xD;
the cause of her alarm, when she heard an-approaching tread.&#xD;
She flew to the window; she recognized the welcome cloak and&#xD;
hat. She was at the floor in an instant.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC8115-00000115"/>&#xD;
228                TOWARDS MIDNIGHT.&#xD;
"0, Hector ! I was never glad"    till now, she would have&#xD;
added; but her~oice died in her throat. What new suspense was&#xD;
this? With the sombre cloak thrown across his chest, muffling&#xD;
his face, he stood motionless upon the threshold.&#xD;
" Hector ! why is this?  Come in! "&#xD;
Still muffled in the cloak, he entered without speaking, and&#xD;
moved slowly towards the room in which the lamp was burning.&#xD;
Charlotte uttered a cry.&#xD;
" You are not Hector ! "&#xD;
The figure. turned, and stood regarding her from beneath the&#xD;
shadow of the hat. The hat was certainly Hector's; likewise the&#xD;
cloak ; but the form, the step, the manner -how changed ! Char-&#xD;
lotte waited for a word or look of explanation. A solemn obei-&#xD;
sance; then the hat was slowly raised, and the folds of the cloak&#xD;
fell from the hidden face.&#xD;
"Edward!"&#xD;
Another stately bow from the hat and cloak..&#xD;
"Your majesty !"&#xD;
" Where is Hector?"&#xD;
" Five fathoms deep, where the salamanders sleep !-I inquired&#xD;
for the Duchess of Dingledom, and they said she had gone to the&#xD;
moon. With rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes, that she&#xD;
may have music wherever she goes. Quippe!"&#xD;
And the prime minister, pirouetting on his left foot, whirled&#xD;
three times, and stood before Charlotte, solemn and stately as&#xD;
ever.&#xD;
"Edward ! Edward ! do not do so ! "&#xD;
"The other way ?" - And, pirouetting on his right foot, he&#xD;
turned thrice in the opposite direction, and stood facing her, as.&#xD;
before. " There shall be dancers in our kingdom. Dancers,&#xD;
prancers, and the light fantastic toe. As a religious exercise,&#xD;
only. I am the centre of the universe : when I turn, all creation&#xD;
whirls ! "&#xD;
" 0 ! tell me, Edward! where is Hector?"&#xD;
" There are some in rags, and some in shags, and some in vel-&#xD;
vet gowns !" Edward distended the wings of the mantle. " This&#xD;
is princely costume. When the warrior {falls, his pockets are&#xD;
&#xD;
TOWARDS MIDNIGHT.                   229&#xD;
plundered. And nobody knows that he lies there, but his hawk,&#xD;
and his hound, and his ladye-fair."&#xD;
"He has been hurt !" cried Charlotte.&#xD;
"The new moon was just over -the old church steeple. It&#xD;
looked like a rind of cheese on a toasting-fork. We'll have three&#xD;
moons in our kingdom, - one yellow, one white, and one pea-&#xD;
green. Since the duchess has gone to the moon, the man in the&#xD;
moon will be henpecked., The sparrow's cap was in the trap, the&#xD;
cat came creeping after - pounce! they '11 tell you the remain-&#xD;
der of the history, when they bring in the feathers."&#xD;
"Edward!" articulated Charlotte; " dear Edward ! ---"&#xD;
"The deer is a superb creature; and to all such we 'll give en-&#xD;
couragement. We '11 sei a premium on fair women, too; and&#xD;
Sheba shall swarm with them. But, if there be any more beauti-&#xD;
ful than your majesty, they shall weat- veils, 'T would peril man's&#xD;
salvation. I have had experience, and can testify for-the race. -&#xD;
Who comes there? -Stand and deliver!w"&#xD;
It was Mrs. Longman, whom Charlotte had summoned by the&#xD;
bell. She regarded Edward with astonishment, having all this&#xD;
time believed him asleep in his chamber. She looked to Char-&#xD;
lotte for an explanation, d a imbibed her fears, with quick sym-&#xD;
pathy, when the terrified girl spoke of Hector.&#xD;
"Hector was a Trojan," said Edward.  "He was chased three&#xD;
times around .the walls, when - chuck ! Acilles cracked him&#xD;
over! Achilles' wrath, to grace the direful spring of woes un-&#xD;
numbered - Andromache was a widow."&#xD;
"tHow did you leave the house?A"&#xD;
"Not by the front threshold. A slimy thing had crept over!"&#xD;
"Why did you go outh"&#xD;
"To look after the prince He lacks attendants, and his state&#xD;
is beggarly. - Solemn times, -when alligators walk on two feet,&#xD;
and carry murder in their bosoms !"&#xD;
"Was there ahiquarrel?"&#xD;
"The cat will play, and after slay!s" Edward made a I orridly&#xD;
suggestive gesture, by drawing his hand, with a gurgling sound,&#xD;
across his throat. "Beards shall grow long in our kingdom:&#xD;
razors being dangerous!"&#xD;

"Edward," said. Mrs. Longman, kindly, but seriously, "this&#xD;
will not do. See ! you distress Charlotte, who has been so good&#xD;
to you!"&#xD;
"Hark to the story ! "  Charlotte and the widow listened.&#xD;
'T is short and sweet:&#xD;
Robin's wife twelve jewels did wear,&#xD;
Three on her bosom, and nine in her hair ;&#xD;
But the jewel more precious than any, said I,&#xD;
Not all Robin's riches are equal to buy.&#xD;
She lacked virtue. Hence the elopement; and Robin lost her&#xD;
and her jewels. I know she is called a duchess; but the man is&#xD;
not her husband. The . ten commandments ar.e  ten-pins, which&#xD;
Satan bowls down with the ball of temptation. Since one has been&#xD;
broken so often, there now exist but nine. When one-falls, the&#xD;
others topple.  Set 'em up, Reverend !. In our kingdom  there&#xD;
shall be a new system of virtue; which will come through the&#xD;
exaltation of our lives, and our devotion to old cheese. Green&#xD;
cheese, innocence; old cheese, virtue; curd is simplicity, --and&#xD;
development is exhibited under the form    of a cheese-press.&#xD;
There 's whey, - that 's weakness; mould,-excessive morality;&#xD;
and bigotry breeds maggots."&#xD;
Charlotte knew 'not what to do. Perhaps it was her own ex-&#xD;
citement that provoked Edward's wildness; but, whatever the&#xD;
cause, she -appeared to have lost all influence over him. Evading&#xD;
her questions, he continued to declaim on all sorts of odd subjects,&#xD;
disconnected, yet not without some subtle ratiocination of his own,&#xD;
jumbling together fragments of sense and nonsense, with occasion-&#xD;
ally a bright gleam of wisdom, shown momentarily, like rays of&#xD;
diamond flashing from heaps of rubbish. His mind seemed like&#xD;
some excellent book, with its pages. disarranged and torn, and its&#xD;
index lost.. In vain Charlotte attempted to restore order. among&#xD;
the leaves. The widow's attempts to assist but rendered matters&#xD;
worse, ,nd the young girl was ready to weep in utter despair,&#xD;
when the sound of wheels at the door sent a thrill to her heart.&#xD;
She flew to open it,.&#xD;
There was a rustling, a fluttering, a few stifled and hurried&#xD;
&#xD;
TOWARDS MIDNIGHt                   231&#xD;
words; and the new comer, with a handkerchief bound upon his&#xD;
head, and with Charlotte, trembling, laughi ig, weeping, upon his&#xD;
arm, marched into the room.&#xD;
"1Ho! Prince of Egypt!" cried Edward, sitting grave and im-&#xD;
movable in the borrowed hat and cloak. "Was it thou in the&#xD;
carriage? Carriages are of the earth, earthy. Railroads are&#xD;
intellectual; but when spiritual laws are understood, men will&#xD;
navigate the air. Meanwhile, majesty creeps."&#xD;
" 'T was a pretty trick you played me! exclaimed Hector.&#xD;
" Her majesty's faith was tested, and she proved herself worthy.&#xD;
The Seven Wise Men have been discoursing."&#xD;
'"The SevenWise Men are dead," said Hector ; "and 'dead&#xD;
men, to be consistent, should speak only the dead languages. Rec-&#xD;
oncile that!"&#xD;
"There 's a wisdom that disdains logic; and we know more than&#xD;
we understand. My feet are ice ; but my head is thawed ; for&#xD;
the moon came down and kissed me with her fiery lips. - If ever&#xD;
I marry,"-Edward's manner changed to airy lightness,-"'t is&#xD;
the moon shall be my bride! for she is lovely and lonely; and so&#xD;
she has told me many a night; and I reach out my hand, and pat&#xD;
her cheek. She smiles! I love the moon, and she loves me!&#xD;
For nine days, I was Lord Bacon; since then, I am Shakspeare,&#xD;
and my moods are poetical. What do you think?"&#xD;
"I think," said Hector, "you are no great Shaks."&#xD;
The stars shall come to the wedding. One bright-eyed little fel&#xD;
low winked at me to-night, -he knows!-But -" in a hoarse&#xD;
whisper -" I '11 be married in HELL ! No cold feet there! and&#xD;
your majesty shall grace the nuptials. Satan reigns; but he 's on&#xD;
a visit to the grogshops, and we ll use his imps for camp-stools."&#xD;
"When may we expect the ceremony?"&#xD;
"When the world is righted. At present, it 's upside down.&#xD;
The coachman is harnessed, and the horses ride and drive. Ne-&#xD;

leads the abject pastor ; the wily shepherd cheats the sheep. Many&#xD;
sow who never reap, uany reap who never sow; the devil laughs;&#xD;
and so we go ! Heigh-ho !"&#xD;
"Be calm," Hector said to Charlotte and Mrs. Longman, " and&#xD;
in a little while he will become so. That 's a bad state of affairs&#xD;
you describe."&#xD;
"Good is at the heart of all things; evil is the shuck. The&#xD;
Prue commandment is not, 'Shun evil,' but '2Love the good;' then&#xD;
evil shall go from you by the law of magnetic repulsion. Evil&#xD;
with good hath close connection, and vice is virtue's imperfection ;&#xD;
desire is the root of love ; and sinning, piety's germinal begin-&#xD;
ning ! In Sheba, all philosophy shall be promulgated by the&#xD;
prime minister ; and it shall be taught in rhymes, Shakspeare&#xD;
inspiring. If there is any problem to solve, propose it."&#xD;
One thing," observed Hector: "with so many people to sleep&#xD;
for, I don't see how .you can afford to sit up so late. I 've no&#xD;
objection to your stealing my beaver; but don't rob Shakspeare&#xD;
of his nap. The wise men grow drowsy ; and it 's my opinion&#xD;
you 'd better go to bed."&#xD;
The counsel is salutary; though I yield," said Edward, gra-&#xD;
ciously, "not to the man, but to the prince."&#xD;
"Will you come, then ?" asked Mrs. Longman.&#xD;
Sweet Sal, you are irresistible !"  Edward adjusted the cloak&#xD;
to the shoulders of a plaster Byron in the corner, placing the hat&#xD;
upon the summit. "I was naked, and you clothed me," turning&#xD;
to Hector ; "therefore, you shall hold high rank in our kingdom.&#xD;
But do not flatter her majesty, for that puts coldness between us.&#xD;
Your coming has brought trouble ; and we are not what we were.&#xD;
Heigh-ho ! and I can't but grieve, the good old days of Adam and&#xD;
of Eve!   The words may seem puerile, but there 's meaning con-&#xD;
cealed. Adam was the first man, Eve was the t' other ; Cain was&#xD;
a wicked man, 'ca'se he killed his brother ! Crack the nut, and&#xD;
the meat is palpable."5&#xD;
"Well, good-night ! "&#xD;
" Bear witness !" said Edward, solemnly. " You are three,-&#xD;
tit, tat, to, three in a row ! And I do here declare and affirm&#xD;
before you, that, all envy aside, I bid her majesty a fair good-&#xD;

but appearing to consider something still required to render his&#xD;
exit impe   he returned, and, putting his head in at the door,&#xD;
eid ipeebo" with a cunning leer, designed, undoubtedly, as&#xD;
say{  id, peep   -&#xD;
the most effective diplomatic stroke of the evening.&#xD;
t" What a fright I have had !" said Charlotte. "How did he&#xD;
get your hat and cloak?"n&#xD;
gI loaned them to him.  He came after us, bareheaded, and&#xD;
thinly clad ; I was afraid that, in his feeble state, he would suffer&#xD;
from the cold; and, as my blood was up, I could very well dispense&#xD;
with the extra clothing. I advised him to keep near me ; but the&#xD;
temptation to play fantastic tricks in my garments was, it seems,&#xD;
too great to be resisted."&#xD;
"And Robert?&#xD;
"0, humanity !" exclaimed Hector ; "thou art a riddle !"&#xD;
"You did not quarrel ?"&#xD;
"No; he acknowledged his wrongs, and made the most solemn&#xD;
Promises for the future."&#xD;
"0, Hector! how could you bring him to that point I''&#xD;
It was not I, but the truth. But do not count too much upon&#xD;
his promises. The evil spirit in him, though humbled, is not&#xD;
killed. He will not trouble us soon, however, I think ; he knows,&#xD;
whom he has to deal with. He is engaging in speculations with&#xD;
Mr. Sperkley, and has pledged himself not to go back to Hunters-&#xD;
ford. So there remains nothing to hinder your return with me&#xD;
to-morrow."&#xD;
"But the danger, - should he choose to take revenge! Here,&#xD;
BIam safe--"&#xD;
"And there you will be safe ; for a time, at least. My mother&#xD;
is dying for yous; I will leave you with her, and go at once to&#xD;
forestall all danger, by striking at the very root of his power."&#xD;
"0, that will be too much to do for me ! "&#xD;
"I cannot do too much for you, Charlotte. Your peace and hap-&#xD;
pness are the jewels of my life. If money and time can purchase&#xD;

them, I will account them cheap. Were it not for my mother, I&#xD;
would not ask you to return. But we must go to her; and while&#xD;
she lives, there we must live, before the world, free from all ap-&#xD;
prehension of evil, and in the face of prejudice."&#xD;
An almost fearful sense of happiness suffused Charlotte's entire&#xD;
being. Could it be real ?  Would she not soon awake, and weep-&#xD;
for her vanished dreanis?&#xD;
"But, even if this should be, could not the affair be accom-&#xD;
plished without a journey ?"&#xD;
"e Possibly.  But I should tremble to intrust so sacred a busi-&#xD;
ness to any, indifferent person."&#xD;
" And your mother," said Charlotte, -" we owe it to her,&#xD;
to seek her sympathy and counsel.   Go to her; tell her al-;&#xD;
keep nothing back ; then, if she permits it, if she desires it, I will'&#xD;
return ! "&#xD;

XXVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
MOTHER AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
HECToR's absence, the loss of Charlotte, and manifold minor&#xD;
troubles of a domestic nature, had produced their effect upon Mrs.&#xD;
Dunbury. Her old physician had been recalled; solemn medical&#xD;
attendance filled the place of the spiritual stimulus for which her&#xD;
spirit famished; and prescriptions became the order of the day -&#xD;
and night.&#xD;
It was difficult to have a "girl."  Bridget's strong arms could&#xD;
embrace the head and front of the household work, but a gentler&#xD;
hand and lighter foot than hers were required in the invalid's&#xD;
chamber. Bertha Wing was recently married, -and had a house-&#xD;
hold of her own to engage her cares. Mr. Fosdick's daughters&#xD;
Might possibly have been had, but Mrs. Dunbury preferred any&#xD;
other attendance. As a last resort, Phoebe Jackwood was sent&#xD;
for, who could come over "for' a few days," she said, "just for&#xD;
accommodation."   Phoebe came accordingly.   It was a day or&#xD;
two before Hector's unexpected return; and his sudden departure&#xD;
for Canada had left her once more alone with his mother.&#xD;
The novelty and importance of the mission pleased Phoebe's&#xD;
girlish heart, and she exerted herself to fulfil it to the invalid's&#xD;
comfort and satisfaction, Her efforts were well appreciated;&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury was grateful; but Phoebe's touch, Phoebe's step,&#xD;
Phoebe's voice, were not the touch, the step, the voice, she loved.&#xD;
She pined for Cha'lotte. Hector had become almost a secondary&#xD;
consideration. Her experience with friends of her own sex had&#xD;
all her life been unsatisfactory.  Never until the past summer&#xD;
had she known a woman's heart that drew out all her symp- thies,&#xD;
Perhaps she loved Charlotte through her son ; but, whatever the&#xD;

influence, she had found in her a charm which she had found in&#xD;
no other, and which now arose fragrant in her memory, until to&#xD;
sense it, breathe it again, became the desire and longing of&#xD;
her life.&#xD;
Hector had been two days absent. On the afternoon of the third&#xD;
day, Corny put his head in at the 'door.&#xD;
"There 's someb'dy comin'up the road, Mrs. Dunb'ry. I guess&#xD;
it 's Hector."&#xD;
"0, Phoebe, run and see ! "&#xD;
Phoebe ran ; Phoebe returned, joyous.&#xD;
" It is Hector !^ I know his cloak ! "&#xD;
"Is she with him?"&#xD;
"There 's somebody with him. If it 's Charlotte, she 's got a&#xD;
new bonnet.   They 're in Mr. Simpkins's wagon; he 's brought&#xD;
em over from the railroad. It is Charlotte ! " cried Phoebe, at&#xD;
the window.  " No, it an't, either ! It may be, though, -she 's&#xD;
behind the driver, and I can't see."&#xD;
A minute later, Hector's foot was on the floor; Hector's arms&#xD;
supported the invalid, as she arose from her pillow.&#xD;
"And Charlotte ?"-.&#xD;
" Charlotte is safe and well."&#xD;
"The new bonnet was Ann Carter !" exclaimed Phoebe, dis-&#xD;
appointed.&#xD;
"Good Phoebe," said Hector, " I want to talk with my mother&#xD;
a little while ; will you let me ?"&#xD;
"The doctor says she is to be kept very quiet," replied the wise&#xD;
Phoebe.&#xD;
"0O, I '11 look to that ! And will you be so kind' as to take&#xD;
away, for a few minutes, the charm of your presence, which will&#xD;
be all the fresher and sweeter, when you again favor us with&#xD;
it ?"&#xD;
Phoebe, with exquisite simplicity : "Do you mean you would&#xD;
'like to have me leave the room? 0, I 'll do that ! Why did n't&#xD;
you say so'( Mrs. Dunbury is to take two table-spoonfuls of that&#xD;
in the bottle  "&#xD;
" 11l attend to tbe bottle ;" and, following Phobe to the door,&#xD;
Hector locked it after her. '&#xD;
&#xD;
MOTHER AND SON.                    237&#xD;
"Ah, mother!" then said he, seating himself by the bed, "this&#xD;
bridge of life we tread upon is a bridge of sighs ! But it is worth&#xD;
the crossing, is it not ? It is through suffering that the depths of&#xD;
our nature are stirred, and existence made great and glorious."&#xD;
" , yes, yes ! " responded the invalid. "But why do you tell&#xD;
me this?"&#xD;
" By way of preamble, mother. A confession and a history&#xD;
follow."&#xD;
" And -- Charlotte?"&#xD;
"Be patient; you shall hear of her ; for I cannot show you my&#xD;
heart, without revealing her image."&#xD;
" I am glad ! "&#xD;
"Before I have finished, perhaps you will be sorry ! "&#xD;
He scarce knew how to proceed. His mother was too feeble to&#xD;
endure a sudden shock. He told of the love and happiness which&#xD;
he thought might be his ; and when all her sympathies were stirred,&#xD;
and joy and faith made her strong, he turned and denounced&#xD;
those false estimates of society, by which love and happiness are&#xD;
so often frustrated. She asserted to all he said.&#xD;
"But, consider ! " he cried; "of two persons who love thus&#xD;
deeply, one may be descended from princes, from Jove himself,&#xD;
while the other is the child of misery and shame!"&#xD;
"We must not forget that Christ was born in a manger,"&#xD;
breathed the invalid.&#xD;
"Glorious thought ! Dear mother, when you speak that sacred&#xD;
name, my whole being is infused with ineffable emotion!  One&#xD;
night, in my absence from you and Charlotte, one strange, memor-&#xD;
able night, when I lay thinking of the world, of life, a great power&#xD;
came upon me; an overshadowing, an' agony,and a light; then to&#xD;
my inner sense a universe was opened, in the midst of which I saw&#xD;
humanity transfigured, - the image of the Father shinig through&#xD;
the Son, and thedove of the Spirit flying to mankind from his&#xD;
bosom of love. In the light that dawned upon me then, I have&#xD;
seen all the circumstances of birth, of wealth, of station, as utterly&#xD;
insignificant to the true being and majesty of the soul. 0, yes,&#xD;
Christ, whom now all the enlightened world adores, in c6stly tem-&#xD;
ples, was born in a manger ; and the instrument of his ignomin-&#xD;

ions death has become the universal symbol of the world's salva.&#xD;

faith upon the externals of society? Yet let us not forget that we&#xD;
are considering'vital truths, and that we have nothing to do with&#xD;
fine theories, that cannot be woven into our lives."&#xD;
" I know, my son, we are uttering social heresies, but let the&#xD;
truth be spoken; then, if we have strength and courage, let us&#xD;
live it! "&#xD;
"Mother, for one born and bred in English society, where the&#xD;
prejudice of elan and caste is as potent as in India, you talk mar-&#xD;
vellously ! ° It is well for you to have suffered from change of&#xD;
fortune, from privation and humiliation, from mental and bodily'&#xD;
anguish, since every tear your eyes have shed has fallen a pearl&#xD;
of wisdom into your lap ! Imagine, now, that I have a dear,'sweet&#xD;
flower ; I bring it to you; shall we stop to consider in what soil it&#xD;
sprung, before enjoying its fragrance and beauty ?"&#xD;
"0 , no; but love it for its own sake, for what it is !"&#xD;
"Nobly answered!" exclaimed Hector.    "It may be found&#xD;
among wretched weeds; it may have drank poisonous dews; its&#xD;
stalk may have been broken, and its leaves trodden under rude&#xD;
and swinish feet. Am I to-cast it from me ?  Or am I to cherish&#xD;
it all the more choicely, for that innate purity, which none of those&#xD;
influences could destroy ?"&#xD;
"You are to cherish it, my son, with all your heart and soul,!"&#xD;
Hector bent down, and as he kissed his mother she felt a warm&#xD;
tear fall upon her cheek.&#xD;
"But, if the possession of this flower brings upon me the shame&#xD;
of the world, and the hatred and persecution of those who broke&#xD;
its stalk and bruised its leaves, -tell me, what then? "&#xD;
"0, my son, I tremble ! - but be you brave, and noble, and&#xD;
strong !"&#xD;
" And if that flower were - Charlotte ? "&#xD;
No response ; but the invalid wept, and, straining Hector to her&#xD;
bosom, responded, fervently,&#xD;
"Then God help you and her !"&#xD;

XXVII.&#xD;
THE FOREST ROAD.&#xD;
ON the edge of the town of Huntersford was a railway-station,&#xD;
consisting simply of a platform of hemlock-boards, erected upon&#xD;
a sand-hill, in a lonely and barren spot, which the corporation had&#xD;
not seen fit to decorate with a "depot."&#xD;
One cold and windy afternoon, late in November, a long, dark&#xD;
train of cars flew smoking and whizzing to the foot of the platform,&#xD;
and stopped. Two passengers were landed, with their baggage,&#xD;
and, once more the mighty monster of steam twanging his terrible&#xD;
cross-bow, the arrowy train sped on, thundering with faint and&#xD;
fainter echoes among the hills. The two passengers looked around&#xD;
in astonishment. A moment sine they were in the midst of a&#xD;
little, crowded world of human life. Now they stood upon a&#xD;
solitary hill, alone ; the train out of sight ; not a human being&#xD;
visible ; no habitation near ; but all around the earth looked&#xD;
desolate and cold, under its crust of snow.&#xD;
" This rather takes one's breath away ! Four miles from home,&#xD;
and no vehicle at hand ! It is a cold welcome I have prepared&#xD;
for you, my poor girl-is it not ? "&#xD;
" I am content as long as you are with me,"-- and a smile of&#xD;
trustful affection played, like sunshine, over the speaker's face.&#xD;
"But isn't there some mistake ? Have we stopped at the right&#xD;
place?"&#xD;
"It's the right place, - but there is a blunder somewhere. I&#xD;
think Corny must have been sent.for us ; and if he were told to&#xD;
come to this station, he would be sure to find some other. What&#xD;
shall we do ? - wait here, or walk ? "&#xD;
Hector looked all around. The prospect was discouraging. No&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8115-00000121"/>&#xD;
240                 THE FOREST ROAD.&#xD;
shelter, no means of conveyance, and no path in the direction they&#xD;
were to travel, but a rough wagon-track cut through the crusty&#xD;
snow. Added to this, night was setting in, and the place was&#xD;
disagreeably suggestive of wolves.&#xD;
"iI must confess myself, for once in my life, completely puzzled f&#xD;
If we wait here, there is a fine prospect of freezing. If we walk&#xD;
on, we may miss the wagon, should it come by the other road. I&#xD;
was never more fully persuaded that it is my duty to be vexed !"&#xD;
" That will be a good plan," replied Charlotte, " if it will bring&#xD;
the wagon."&#xD;
" It is growing dark very fast," said Hector. " I think, before&#xD;
it is too late, I will make an excursion into the hollow, and see&#xD;
what I can discover."&#xD;
"Let me go with you!"&#xD;
"Are you afraid to stay alone?"&#xD;
"No, not afraid ; but let me go with you."&#xD;
" Dear child, the -road will be rough for these tender feet of&#xD;
yours; but I will not leave you for a moment. We will stay or&#xD;
go together."&#xD;
Until now Charlotte had managed to wear a cheerful aspect;&#xD;
but when Hector, talking to her so kindly and affectionately, made&#xD;
her sit down upon a piece of baggage, and warmed her cold feet&#xD;
in his hands, she could no longer repress her tears.&#xD;
"Forgive me ! "&#xD;
"Forgive you, indeed ! You have a right to cry," said Hector,&#xD;
looking up into her face.&#xD;
" It is as much for happiness as for anything else," replied&#xD;
Charlotte, through her tears. "You are so good to me !"&#xD;
"So good.! when I have brought you out here in the wilderness,&#xD;
as .if to perish ! This, too, at a time when your path should&#xD;
be all strewn with flowers ! "&#xD;
"'It is nothing, since yoi are with me ! But, 0, Hector ! I&#xD;
have all along seen a dark. shadow before me, in the direction of&#xD;
-Huntersford."&#xD;
" A shadow ? how-?"&#xD;
" A foreboding of something to happen to us both. 0O, it is&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FOREST ROAD.                   241&#xD;
not this, - but this seems a forerunner of disappointments sent to&#xD;
warn us. You think me weak, I know."&#xD;
"Not weak, brave girl! if, when the disappointments come, you&#xD;
are strong to bear them."&#xD;
"With you to assure me of this, how can I be unhappy ? "&#xD;
responded Charlotte, with a beaming look.&#xD;
They left the baggage on the platform, and walked to the foot&#xD;
of the acclivity. . Beyond was the bed of Wild River, which flowed&#xD;
through chasms and gorges among the hills. The road they were&#xD;
to follow led along-its banks, on the borders of an old forest, whose&#xD;
deep silence was broken only by the voice of the pouring waters.&#xD;
Wagons had passed when the earth was soft; it was now frozen,&#xD;
and the way appeared toothed with irregular, sharp clods of ice.&#xD;
It was painful for Charlotte to proceed; but, fortunately, the&#xD;
distance was not long through the the woods, and on the other&#xD;
side was a small village, where a conveyance could' be procured.&#xD;
Hector cheered his companion with this prospect ; but before they&#xD;
had gone far they heard the sound of a wagon. Then somebody&#xD;
cracked a whip in the woods, and said, " Go 'long ! "  The voice&#xD;
was unmistakable.&#xD;
" Mr. Jackwood !"&#xD;
" Hello ! " cried the farmer, pulling up his horse. " That you,&#xD;
Hector .Dunbury? Ye, got Cha'lotte Woods with ye, too, han't&#xD;
ye ? How d'e du, Cha'lotte?"&#xD;
Charlotte submitted her hand to the hearty grasp of the farmer,&#xD;
who got out of his wagon to greet her.&#xD;
"I 'm glad' enough to see ye agin! Got tired o' waitin',&#xD;
did n't ye ? I was jes' goin' over to the railroad arter ye. I ca'-&#xD;
c'lated I was goin' to be a leetle late."&#xD;
" Where is father ?" asked Hector.&#xD;
"0 ! your father - he 's met with a bit of an accident to-day,&#xD;
I'm sorry to say."&#xD;
" An accident F"&#xD;
"P'raps you 'd better not git in till I turn about," suggested&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood. "'T an't a very comf'table place to turn in; I&#xD;
shall hatf to cramp and back."&#xD;

242                 THE FOREST ROAD.&#xD;
He stepped to the horse's head, and, holding the bridle with&#xD;
both hands, commenced turning very slowly and carefully.&#xD;
" What has happened at home ?" demanded Hector.&#xD;
"Look an' see if I 'm backin' against that 'ere stump," cried&#xD;
the farmer.  "I thought I should jes' graze it. If it's in the&#xD;
way, sing out."&#xD;
" You are all right. Start up a little now," said Ilector.&#xD;
" Hold ! Come, Charlotte."&#xD;
They got up into the wagon; and Mr. Jackwood, placing a&#xD;
board, with a woolly sheep-skin upon it, across the box before&#xD;
them, as a seat for himself, gathered up his reins and whip, and&#xD;
drove back through the woods.&#xD;
" That 's a terrible awk'ard place to stop at, where you come,"&#xD;
-turning his head so as to throw his voice behind him, and at the&#xD;
same time to keep an eye on his horse.   "Unless ye have a&#xD;
team to meet ye, ye might as well be- set down in Egypt. I '11&#xD;
git ye home quick as I can, then go back arter yer baggage."&#xD;
Hector interrupted him, to ask again about the accident.&#xD;
" Wal," said Mr. Jackwood.   " I thought best to let your&#xD;
narves git settled a leetle mite, 'fore I told ye. It 's as well as&#xD;
any way to take sich things easy-like, ye know. Yer father was&#xD;
goin' over to East Huntersford with a load o' grain; I guess&#xD;
't was 'bout 'leven o'clock when he drove by my house; me and&#xD;
Bim'lech was haulin' a leetle jag o' wood to the door, an' I should&#xD;
judge it could n't ben much arter evene, if 't was at all. I rather&#xD;
thought Mr. Dunbury was takin' his produce over to the East, so&#xD;
I hailed him; for I 'd heerd him say a man there had offered&#xD;
some three cents on a bushel more 'n they give in the village, to&#xD;
have it delivered at the railroad. He stopped to talk a little&#xD;
while, an' it struck me he had on too much of a load. Says I,&#xD;
'An't you'fraid you 've got more 'n your team '11 git along 'ith com-&#xD;
f't'bly ?' says I. He said no, he guessed not ; he had .jes' so&#xD;
much grain to spare, an' he thought 't was better to take it all one&#xD;
load, than make two bites to a cherry. ''Of course,' said I, 'you&#xD;
know a good deal the best about it,' says I; 'but, if 't was mine,&#xD;
I should feel jest the least mite ticklish 'bout that 'ere off hoss.&#xD;
When Wing owned him,' says I, 'he had a bad trick of frettin',&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FOREST ROAD.                    243&#xD;
when a load troubled him; p'tic'larly when he started with 't; an&#xD;
sometimes,' says I, 'he 'd git spunky, and would n't draw at all.'&#xD;
Your father said he 'd broke him o' that-trick, he guessed. ' If&#xD;
so,' says I,' I should n't be 'fraid of a middlin' kind o' load, like&#xD;
that 'ere. My team would n't think nothin' on 't.' But I noticed,&#xD;
when he started, the off hoss acted kind o' ugly ; he jerked, an'&#xD;
flinched, as though the collar hurt his breast, - jes' 's he use' to,&#xD;
when Wing owned him, for all the world. But I thought I&#xD;
would n't. say nothin' more, though I'm sorry now I did n't; for&#xD;
it 'pears Mist' Dunbury had n't more 'n got to the railroad crossin',&#xD;
when the pesky beast made a fuss agin, an' balked, with the load&#xD;
right acrost the track. I never 'd let a team stop that way ; I'd&#xD;
git 'em off the track, somehow ; if they would n't go ahead, I'd&#xD;
made 'em back, if there was any back to 'em! But prob'bly Mr.&#xD;
Dunbury didn't think o' that. Wal, sir," said Mr. Jackwood,&#xD;
turning almost entirely around, and demonstrating to his listeners&#xD;
with his hands, "there he was when the cars come. The man 't&#xD;
told me the story see 'em, an' yelled out ; but your father was&#xD;
prob'bly doin' his best, an',could n't do no more, to save the&#xD;
nation. I asked the man, says I, ' Why didn't you help,' says I,&#xD;
'instid o' standin' there an' hollerin', when hollerin' could n't do&#xD;
no good?' says I. But he said he had a skittish hoss to hold,&#xD;
an' he did n't dare to leave him a minit, when the engine was&#xD;
in sight.- I thougfit it a kind o' milk-an'-water excuse, but I&#xD;
did n't say nothin'; the hoss was stole, an' there wan't no use&#xD;
lockin' the barn-door. Wal, sir," repeated Mr. Jackwood, warm-&#xD;
ing as he approached the catastrophe, "the cars come ! My -&#xD;
informer "- he appeared to hesitate a little about making use of&#xD;
so elegant a word -"told me 't was the awfulest sight he ever see.&#xD;
He no more expected to find Mist' Dunbury alive than - Wal,&#xD;
he 'd no idee on 't ! But the cars did n't hit him, mind ye. He&#xD;
was jest untacklin' the team, to git 'em out o' the way, when the&#xD;
ingine struck. He was insenseless when they took him up, but&#xD;
he turned out to be not half so much hurt as everybody thought&#xD;
for. They brought him home, this arternoon,, an' I guess he 's&#xD;
doin' as well as could be expected. What was queer, the cars&#xD;
wan't thrown off the track ; they ripped right through the wagon,&#xD;

Mist' Dunbury had got 'em unhitched jes' 't the minute the ingine&#xD;
struck. They was too mad to be scart, I imagine, or else they 'd&#xD;
a' started 'ith the wagon when the whistle blowed; but they&#xD;
did n't, an' when the cars come up, they run right agin the near-&#xD;

their harnesses and gone to Jericho. On 'the hull, it seems a&#xD;

XXVIII.&#xD;
THE FACE AT THE WINDOW.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHARLOTTE could not have returned to her old home under more&#xD;
disheartening circumstances.  It was like entering a hospital.&#xD;
Mr. Danbury lay groaning with his injuries, and the shock of the&#xD;
accident had thrown his feeble and fast-failing wife into a low and&#xD;
perilous state.&#xD;
But Charlotte bore up bravely, and her cheerful demeanor&#xD;
carried an energizing .influence to the spirit of her old friend.&#xD;
"sMy dear child," said the invalid to her, one day, with grateful&#xD;
emotion, "how shall I ever repay you for all your sacrifices?"&#xD;
"0! if you could only know how richly I feel repaid ! These&#xD;
are the sweetest and happiest days of my whole life!"&#xD;
The invalid could not doubt-it. Hector was at Charlotte's side;&#xD;
and day and night, with enduring love and patience, hand in hand&#xD;
they administered to the wants of the sufferers. It mattered not&#xD;
how severe their duties were; the exchange of a look or word, as&#xD;
they met for an instant, in passing from room to room, or at the&#xD;
bedside of either of the patients, compensated for all.&#xD;
"0, Charlotte!" Hector would say, with a smile of ineffable&#xD;
meaning; and no answer so cheering' and sweet as the glance of&#xD;
her lustrous eyes. Then there were the watches of the night,&#xD;
when sleep and quiet reigned, and they could steal away from&#xD;
their almost incessant cares, and sit together undisturbed, con-&#xD;
versing low, or keeping hallowed silence, in the still hours.&#xD;
One of these memorable nights found them in Mrs. Dunbury's&#xD;
room. She was sleeping in the mild shade of'the bed-curtains,&#xD;
while a profound and measured breathing, issuing through the&#xD;
open door of the adjoining'sick chamber, marked Mr. Dunbury's&#xD;
21*&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC8115-00000124"/>&#xD;
246            THE FACE AT THE WINDOW.&#xD;
heavy slumbers. All was quiet; Charlotte, wearied with the toils&#xD;
of the day, reclined upon the lounge ; and Hector sat near, shad-&#xD;
ing her eyes from the light. Suddenly he observed a slight start,&#xD;
and a cessation of her breath.&#xD;
"You were dreaming," he said, leaning over her.&#xD;
It was some seconds before she spoke.-- "Did you see that&#xD;
face?"&#xD;
"A face?   Where?"&#xD;
" At the window.. Do not stir; it may come again."&#xD;
They waited several minutes. Both watched, but saw noth-&#xD;
ing. " Are you sure there was a face?"&#xD;
" I saw it plainly! It peered in between the curtains. But&#xD;
it vanished."&#xD;
" Do not be alarmed," said Hector; for Charlotte trembled.&#xD;
"lIam  not ; but it gave me a start ! There is scarcely a1y-&#xD;
thing more frightful than such an apparition at a window by&#xD;
night.  The darkness and mystery-"     Another tremor, and&#xD;
Charlotte's hand pressed Hector's arm.&#xD;
"Again?" he whispered.&#xD;
"It passed by the casement !"&#xD;
"I was looking, but saw nothing."&#xD;
" The lamp shines in your eyes," said Charlotte. "I saw the&#xD;
outline distinctly."&#xD;
" Sit still," - and Hector arose softly. " I will try what dis-&#xD;
coveries I can make."&#xD;
"You will not leave the house ?"&#xD;
"I do not know."&#xD;
He left his lamp in the kitchen, and, muffling himself in his&#xD;
cloak, went silently from the house. The heavens were starless;&#xD;
but the snow upon the ground gave a faint glimmer to the night.&#xD;
Hector moved cautiously towards the front yard, watching and&#xD;
listening. He heard nothing, saw no living object. He advanced&#xD;
to the trees, and, passing through the open gate, looked up and&#xD;
down the road. No discovery. After some minutes, he gave up&#xD;
the search; but, as he turned to retrace his steps, he perceived a&#xD;
movement by the trunk of one of the large trees. He rushed to&#xD;
the spot, and a man stepped out'before him. Hector was no cow-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FACE AT THE WINDOW.                 247&#xD;
ard; but, it must be confessed, the promptness with which he was&#xD;
met gave his blood a start.&#xD;
.Good-evening, sir," said he. The figure stood silent and mo-&#xD;
tionless. "II said good-evening. It is politeness to return a sal-&#xD;
utation. What is your business here?"&#xD;
The same silence and mystery. A deep determination swelled&#xD;
in Hector's tones. "Though you have no tongue, you have, at&#xD;
least, a face!  If I cannot hear the one, I'll see the other ! "&#xD;
Still no answer; and Hector laid his hand upon, the figure's arm.&#xD;
" Will you speak? If not - there is the house, and you shall&#xD;
march into it ! You'll find it is no jest!"&#xD;
His grasp tightened ; but at the instant he was shaken off, and&#xD;
the man sprang upon him. He was not unprepared, but the&#xD;
suddenness of the onset caused him to recoil. As he did so,&#xD;
with a dexterous movement he cast off his cloak, and flung it,&#xD;
outspread, full into the face of his antagonist; then, while the&#xD;
latter was beating it off, he seized him by the middle, lifted him&#xD;
clear from his feet, and hurled him with all his might upon the&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
The snow was not deep; yet it was sufficient to break the&#xD;
force of the fall. 'And now the cloak, which had previously em-&#xD;
barrassed the assailant, did him excellent service. While he fell&#xD;
upon one part of it, he managed to twist them opposite corner&#xD;
about Hector's face and chest. The struggle was violent. Both&#xD;
regained their feet together; and the assailant, literally tearing&#xD;
himself from Hector's embrace, fled with all speed down the road.&#xD;
Hector did not pursue, but, gathering up his cloak, returned to&#xD;
the house. At the door he was met by the alarmed and eager&#xD;
Charlotte. She suppressed a cry ofspain. His face was streaked&#xD;
with blood.&#xD;
"I cannot be much hurt," said he, "since I did not know it. I&#xD;
received a slight brush in carrying away this trophy."&#xD;
"What is it?'&#xD;
"It hath the appearance of a coat-button, with a strip of cloth&#xD;
attached, like unto a comet with a tail. It belongs to the face&#xD;
you saw at the window. You look frightened; but there 's no&#xD;
occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC8115-00000125"/>&#xD;
248            THE FACE AT THE WINDOW.&#xD;
"Who was it?"&#xD;
"You can guess as well as I. Not a word could I force from&#xD;
the villain; and his intention evidently was, to knock me down,&#xD;
then make his escape. I know of but one man who could have&#xD;
any possible motive for prowling around our windows. I im  ane&#xD;
how a jealous rage might 'prompt him to the act, even with no&#xD;
definite purpose in view."&#xD;
"But his promises-- "&#xD;
'"They would not be the first he has broken. However sincere&#xD;
he may have been in making them, he is a slave to passion,&#xD;
and there is no faith to be placed in him. 0," said Hector,&#xD;
"had it not been for my father's accident, a d  r     or &#xD;
would be by this time at an end, and you should and byiy&#xD;
side before the world !-But don't be troubled. I    by yo&#xD;
to-morrow."-&#xD;
On the following day, Hector made an errand to the village,&#xD;
but sought in vain for any clue of intelligence which might lead&#xD;
to a solution of the mystery. On his way home, however, stop-&#xD;
ping to make some purchases at the store, he encountered a poor&#xD;
tailor, who had his shop in anobscure streetof the town. p&#xD;
"How do you do, Peter ?"&#xD;
"0, how do you do ?" said Peter, obseuiousl    "&#xD;
ever so much a stranger !"&#xD;
"How is business, this winter?"&#xD;
"0, not over 'n above bright!  Give me a call. I don't do a&#xD;
very smashing business, but my work is done well."&#xD;
"So I have heard," replied Hector; "and the first I have to be&#xD;
'done in town shall be given to you."&#xD;
"Thank you!" said Peter.S&#xD;
"You are looking at some buttons. Let me help you choose&#xD;
them. What sort of a button do you want?"&#xD;
" A  good over-coat button," said Peter.  "Something about&#xD;
this size and quality," -showing an exact mate to the trophy&#xD;
Hector had brought off the night before.&#xD;
" That 's a handsome button!&#xD;
-It 's a good and durable article," answered Peter poes-&#xD;
ally  "I 'ye an assortment of these; but I'mn doing a  rofsofn-&#xD;
&#xD;

ciful custom er,-he wants something different; and, in consequence&#xD;
of one being lost from his coat, I 'm to change the whole set."&#xD;
"If I knew your customer," said Hector, "I might tell you&#xD;
just what article he would fancy."&#xD;
"uOf course," returned Peter, softly, "there 'll be no harm in&#xD;
mentioning it, though he appeared a little sensitive about having&#xD;
it known 't he 'd come back to town, or 't I was doing his work.&#xD;
It 's Robert- Greenwich."&#xD;
a Indeed!" said Hector.   " Then here is just the button.&#xD;
Give him a set of these, by all means!"&#xD;
He chose the device of a serpent biting its own coils. Peter&#xD;
admired the selection, and declared that he should abide by it.&#xD;
" He shall wear serpentine buttons, and have me to thank for&#xD;
it!" said Hector to himself. "Meanwhile, I must take out his&#xD;
fangs."&#xD;
He visited a banking office, where he had money deposited,&#xD;
and procured a draft upon New York ; then hastened home to&#xD;
Charlotte. "It is as I feared. Robert is in town. But don't be&#xD;
disturbed. My resolution is formed."&#xD;
"You will go?" said Charlotte, pale with anxiety.&#xD;
"Yes - at once. I have delayed too long. Be brave, Char-&#xD;
lotte! -I must speak with father."&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury was sitting up, with his feet upon -a chair, and&#xD;
his unfortunate shoulder in a sling, when Hector entered the&#xD;
room. "What orders have you for me to-day, father?"&#xD;
"None, that I know of."  Mr. Dunbury's voice sounded like a&#xD;
growl. Hector was not surprised; for he had not heard him&#xD;
speak pleasantly since his accident.&#xD;
"Is there nothing I can do for you?"&#xD;
"No. I am better. I can wait upon myself. It is time I&#xD;
was doing something. I have been here long enough.&#xD;
"You could not have chosen a better time," said Hector, "for&#xD;
there is little to be done on the farm; scarce enough to keep&#xD;
Corny in motion. It is as much as you ought to do to oversee&#xD;
things, where you think there is need. Could you confine your-&#xD;
self to this, in case I should leave you for a few days ?"&#xD;
"At all events, I can dispense with your services, if that is&#xD;
what you wish."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC8115-00000126"/>&#xD;
250            THE FACE AT THE WINDOW.&#xD;
"You misunderstand me, father. I never did anything more&#xD;
cheerfully than what I have had to do for you. Has it appeared&#xD;
otherwise?"&#xD;
There was a thrill of emotion in Rector's voice, which softened&#xD;
his parent.  "I acknowledge you have shown me all the kindness&#xD;
I have deserved. More, perhaps; for I have not been patient;&#xD;
I have given you cause to abandon me."&#xD;
I have had no thought of abandoning you-no wish to leave&#xD;
you for a day. But I have other duties to perform. I should&#xD;
have gone about them within three days of my return from Can-&#xD;
ada, with Charlotte, had it not been for your accident. It has&#xD;
not been without misgivings that I have neglected them; and now&#xD;
circumstances render it imperative that they should be attended&#xD;
to, at once."&#xD;
" You do not see fit to impart your business to me."&#xD;
" I cannot very well do so until my return; because it is not&#xD;
altogether my own."&#xD;
"Whose, then ?"&#xD;
"So much I can tell you, but let it be in confidence; it is Char.&#xD;
lotte's !&#xD;
"Charlotte's, - hem!" muttered Mr. Dunbury, with a clouded&#xD;
brow. " I do not understand Charlotte. She came here a ser-&#xD;
vant. One would think now she was mistress of the house."&#xD;
Father," replied Hector, " this is a subject we will not argue..&#xD;
You know that my mother's welfare required that she'should be&#xD;
here; and it was by your consent, if not by your desire, that I&#xD;
went for her. Shyie        to our entreaties ; but it was at a&#xD;
sacrifice of peculiar advant s her Canadian home afforded;&#xD;
and, in return, I promised to transact the personal business of&#xD;
hers to which I have alluded. I have now to fulfil my promise.&#xD;
On my return you shall know everything."&#xD;
" When do you leave?"&#xD;
"To-morrow; and I may be absent two or three weeks."&#xD;
"Very well," muttered Mr. Dunbury.&#xD;
His countenance showed a sullen discontent; but he gave the&#xD;
subject no more words; and it only remained for Rector to make&#xD;
prepratonsfor his journey.&#xD;
&#xD;
XXIX.&#xD;
THE GREENWICH FAMILY.&#xD;
IN a small, old-fashioned apartment, with a tall chest of drawers,&#xD;
with brass handles, on one side, a suspended book-case on the other,&#xD;
and an ancient clock, with weights and pendulum swinging almost&#xD;
to the floor, in the corner, the Greenwich family might have been&#xD;
found assembled, early one winter's evening. Near the centre of&#xD;
the room was a table, at which sat the squire, with spectacles on&#xD;
his nose, a worn and venerable volume open before him, and his&#xD;
snuff-box at his left hand. Behind him, in an obscure position,&#xD;
sat the meek Mrs. Greenwich, knitting. At the end- of the table&#xD;
was Etty, the genius, engaged upon a poetical composition, her&#xD;
large, high forehead shining like marble, as she leaned over her&#xD;
paper in the light.  Last, not least, was Robert, in the corner&#xD;
opposite the clock, with his head on his breast, his arms folded,&#xD;
and his legs stretched out towards the stove.&#xD;
"How many varses have you composed, my child?" whispered&#xD;
Mrs. Greenwich, behind her husband's back.&#xD;
"Five," replied Etty, with a perplexed look. "I'm trying to&#xD;
find a rhyme to crystal; then I shall have six."&#xD;
"Pistol," suggested Mrs.-Greenwich.&#xD;
"Mrs. Greenwich ! " said the squire, in a grave tone, " are&#xD;
you aware that I am reading?"&#xD;
"0!" exclaimed the lady, obsequiously.&#xD;
Silence again The old gentleman reading; Etty puzzling her&#xD;
unhappy brain over her composition ; Robert chewing the cud of&#xD;
meditation in the corner, Presently Mrs. Greenwich moved her&#xD;
chair carefully back, with a smile of maternal encouragement&#xD;
S      brightening in her face.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC8115-00000127"/>&#xD;
252             THE GREENWICH FAMILY.&#xD;
"Can you make pistol do ? "&#xD;
"Mrs. Greenwich ! " said the squire's precise accents, "how&#xD;
many times must I request not to be disturbed when that I am&#xD;
reading?"  He pushed his book across the table, shoved back his&#xD;
chair, raised his spectacles above his eyebrows, and rapped the lid&#xD;
of his snuff-box. Mrs. Greenwich trembled ; Etty sighed; Robert&#xD;
crossed his legs and scowled. A family lecture was expected.&#xD;
Whilst the old gentleman was clearing his throat, and purected.&#xD;
his mouth into a patriarchal grimace, his wife hazarded an expla-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
"4Etty could n't find a rhyme to crystal, and I thought it would&#xD;
do no harm to help her a little. Poor child! she does n't receive&#xD;
any too much encouragement                          r&#xD;
Mr. Greenwich raised his hand. That hand meant silence; and&#xD;
silence ensued.&#xD;
"Daughter ?"-&#xD;
"What!"&#xD;
" Daughter ? "&#xD;
Etty, more lady-like : "What, sir ?"&#xD;
" Why did you not respond, when that I addressed you&#xD;
before ?"aresdyu&#xD;
" I did, sir."&#xD;
"What did you say, daughter ? "&#xD;
Etty, hesitating : " I said -what."&#xD;
"Was that a response, daughter?"&#xD;
"No, sir,"&#xD;
"That is all. Remember. Now, what is the rhyme?"&#xD;
"A rhyme to crystal."&#xD;
" I thought pistol was good," Mrs. Greenwich ventured to&#xD;
interpose.&#xD;
"There 's a, rhyme for you, Etty, ready cocked and. rimed"&#xD;
said Robert, with gloomy humor, from the corner.&#xD;
" Mrs. Greenwich ! Robert !  I am speaking&#xD;
paternal head! Daughter?" ..                   Respect the&#xD;
"What, father?"&#xD;
"Name the subject of your composition."&#xD;
"' The Fair Nun's Complaint,' " said Etty, readily.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE GREENWICH FAMILY.                  253&#xD;
It is absurd," returned the paternal head, with a look at Mrs.&#xD;
Greenwich, which expressed his opinion of her capacity, " to sug-&#xD;
gest a rhyme, without regardto the subject of the composition.&#xD;
What has the 'Fair Nun's Complaint' to do with pistols.&#xD;
Mrs. Greenwich, simpering: 'I thought Etty could work it in,&#xD;
she 's so ingenious ! "&#xD;
Mr. Greenwich, with a significant nod: "That will do, Mrs.&#xD;
Greenwich! Now to the poem." - The genius read a stanza. -&#xD;
" Very creditable, my daughter. Subject, Fair Nun's Complaint;&#xD;
quatrains; octosyllabic measure, with redundant syllable at the&#xD;
end of first and third lines; rhyme required to crystal. Now for&#xD;
our rules. What is the body of the word?"&#xD;
That was found to be ystal- and the application of rules con-&#xD;
sisted in finding among consonant sounds another head to match&#xD;
the decapitated word. Father and daughter went through with&#xD;
the alphabet together, but without success.  Heads were plenty&#xD;
enough, but, as Robert moodily suggested from his corner, the&#xD;
difficulty was to find one that had sense in it. An endless variety&#xD;
of such combinations as bystal, cystal, dystal, down to zystal, were&#xD;
manufactured, not one of which existed in any known dictionary.&#xD;
There was a solitary exception. It was the word postal, or&#xD;
pistol.&#xD;
"Pistol," said Mr. Greenwich, "appears, then, to be our only&#xD;
perfect rhyme."&#xD;
" What did I tell you, Etty ?" spoke up the mother, with a&#xD;
gleam of triumph.&#xD;
"Mrs. Greenwich," observed the paternal head, with stern pre-&#xD;
cision, "your assistance is NOT required.&#xD;
0 ! !"- and Mrs. Greenwich settled down again, with an anni-&#xD;
hilated expression.&#xD;
"What do we do in the case, daughter ?" said the squire.&#xD;
Etty replied that where no perfect rhymes would answer, imper-&#xD;
fect ones might-be used.&#xD;
" Then," said Robert, "what do you say to whistle ? If your&#xD;
nun, with the tears of crystal, only knew how to whistle, you would&#xD;
be provided for ; you could bring it in finely. Or gristle, or sizzle,&#xD;
- you have plenty of such rhymes. How would. drizzle do?"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC8115-00000128"/>&#xD;
254 ,THE GREENWIC                FAMILY.&#xD;
"Soin Robert, you amaze me! " uttered the paternal head, with&#xD;
a look of solemn displeasure. Then turning to Etty: "Daughter,&#xD;
I have the required rhyme. It i a felicitous word, inasmuch as&#xD;
that it is in perfect keeping with your subject. It is vestal. A&#xD;
nun may be called a vestal. I trust to your happy talent to make&#xD;
fitting use of it in the structure of the lines."&#xD;
But Robert's ridicule was too much fr the sensitive child; and&#xD;
the discovery of a fine rhyme was no consolation for his sarcasm.&#xD;
e was crying.&#xD;
"9Hem !" coughed the paternal head, moving in his chair. Ie&#xD;
drew up his book, and shoved it from him again; wiped his spec-&#xD;
tacles, and saddled them once more on his eyebrows ; then took&#xD;
another pinch of snuff. "You may put aside your varses for the&#xD;
present, daughter. Mrs. Greenwich, will you oblige me by dis-&#xD;
pensing with your knitting-work, and bestowing attention upon&#xD;
my remarks ? Son Robert, a more respectful attitude will be&#xD;
quite as becoming in listening to what your father has to say.&#xD;
en that all appear prepared to hear, I will proceed."&#xD;
d.Robert changed his position by crossing his legs in a contrary&#xD;
direction, and clasping his hands over his head, instead of behind&#xD;
his chair. A deep silence followed,.broken only by the purring&#xD;
of the cat, as she rubbed her neck affectionately against the old&#xD;
lady's dress, and by the slow ticking of the old clock in the&#xD;
corner.&#xD;
Mr. Greenwich, impressively : " We are waiting for Robert."&#xD;
"0, waiting for me? What can I do for you, sir?"&#xD;
"If you do not perceive, we will wait until that you do."&#xD;
Whether Robert knew from experience that his father would&#xD;
keep his word, and wait all night, if necessary, in the same fear-&#xD;
ful silence, or whether he reflected that it was injudicious to&#xD;
provoke the paternal displeasure too openly, he yielded the point,&#xD;
and assumed a more decorous attitude.&#xD;
"Son Robert," then said the old gentleman, placing the book&#xD;
on his knees, and laying his spectacles upon it,"your conduct has&#xD;
led of pleasing me of late, and I have treasured a few words&#xD;
r your edification. A fit occasion to deliver them hath arrived."h&#xD;
~Ten followed a tedious discourse, of half an hour's duration, on&#xD;

the subject of family discipline, reverence to the paternal head,&#xD;
d kindred topics, with a particular application to Robert's case.&#xD;
"But this is not all. The report is, son Robert, that you indulge,&#xD;
n ndram-drinking ; and you have carried your disregard for my&#xD;
she's so far as to smoke cigars even in my own house." There-&#xD;
upon the paternal head took a violent pinch of snuff. "You may&#xD;
ply, that you are of an age to regulate your own conduct in this&#xD;
reject. I will forestall the remark, by saying that no child of&#xD;
mine is of an age to transgress my commands beneath my own&#xD;
roof. Your other irregularities have not escaped public censure,&#xD;
and I have more than once taken occasion to remind you of your&#xD;
derelictions. Your instability of character:has become notorious.&#xD;
When that you returned from Mobile, where you had an excellent,&#xD;
lucrative situation, you gave as an excuse, that you had taken a&#xD;
summer vacation, to avoid the extreme heat of the climate. But,&#xD;
the summer over, you must be posting off to the north, in search&#xD;
of new employment. Now, there is another change ; and you have&#xD;
some mysterious business on your hands, which you will commu-&#xD;
nicate to nobody.  You go and come, as the whim takes you;&#xD;
appearing to make my house a sort of den to hide in, and acting&#xD;
more like a culprit than a son of respectable 'Squire Greenwich.&#xD;
Your disposition, moreover, exhibits the effect of idle habits, inas-&#xD;
much as that you are morose and sullen, and that your principal&#xD;
pleasure appears to consist in ridiculing your sister's noble aims.&#xD;
I need not again.remind you that all this is to be reformed. You&#xD;
will now please withdraw, and ponder what has been said. Daugh-&#xD;
ter I have a few remarks for you."&#xD;
Without a word, Robert rose, and went to his chamber. Half&#xD;
an hour later, his door was pushed open, and Etty looked timidly&#xD;
in. e sat before his desk, leaning his face upon his clenched&#xD;
hands, with an unfinished letter lying before him in the lamp-&#xD;
light. The child's eyes were red with weeping, but she had dried&#xD;
her tears, which her brother so much hated, and she was trying&#xD;
.very hard to look cheerful, as she approached the desk.&#xD;
"What do you want?"    What she wanted was but a simple&#xD;
and easy thing to grant. The poor child could not sleep that&#xD;
night without telling him how sorry she was to have displeased&#xD;

He extended the manuscript, and, as she bent forward, confused&#xD;
and trembling, to obey, struck her with it upon the cheek.&#xD;
"Is it interesting ?" said he, with a malicious laugh.&#xD;
"0, Robert ! I did not mean --&#xD;
"That will do, my dear. Thank you for your interest in m&#xD;

With a bursting heart, holding her hand to her face, Etty hast-~&#xD;
ened to relieve him of her hated preseirwe, and, retreating to her&#xD;
room, threw herself upon her pillow in convulsions of girlish&#xD;

AN UNWELCOME GUEST.&#xD;
Hacron's preparations were made. Then came the parting.&#xD;
0 Charlotte! be bravo! be strong!. What is life, what is death,&#xD;
what are the pangs and fears of a day, if thou hast faith in the&#xD;
immortality of love ?&#xD;
Charlotte was brave and strong ; she looked beyond all the&#xD;
clouds that hung over her path, into the light of a clear, deep&#xD;
heaven, to which Hector pointed her, and which love and truth&#xD;
made theirs, whatever might be their fortunes for a time. She&#xD;
gave him only words and looks of encouragement at their parting,&#xD;
and waved her handkerchief to him from her window, until he&#xD;
was shut from her view. Then what ears she shed in the&#xD;
secrecy of her chamber, no one knew. When she entered Mrs.&#xD;
Dunbury's room, it was she who had strength and cheer to impart&#xD;
to the desponding mother.&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury, still suffering from his hurts, grew more moody&#xD;
F =   than before. In the unoccupied hours of his indisposition, his&#xD;
morbid mind dwelt upon the past. He remembered the golden&#xD;
prospects of his youth, his proud family connections, the elegance&#xD;
and ease that graced his early life.. From that bright beginning,&#xD;
his star had waned and sunk, until now he could look upon hims&#xD;
self only as a coarse and vulgar old man. He was conscious that&#xD;
all the finer feelings of his youth were deadened.  Life had&#xD;
become a desert; with not one oasis in the dreary waste of common&#xD;
toils and trials, on which to feed a hope. And it was his own&#xD;
wretched folly which alone he had to accuse. Conviviality,&#xD;
extravagance, wild dissipation, ruin; such was his history. Two&#xD;
pictures, in tragical contrast, hung forever before his eyes,- what&#xD;
:_o°               22*&#xD;

258               AN UNWELCOME TEST.&#xD;
he might have been -what he was ! Thus, memory became&#xD;
remorse, and gnawed his heart.  Or if at any time his better&#xD;
angel whispered that by a true life he might still atone for his&#xD;
errors, his thousand resolutions in the past, made only to be&#xD;
broken, arose like ghosts before him, grinning and mocking.&#xD;
All this Charlotte perceived. She knew, too, that he regarded&#xD;
her with jealous eyes. He was proud still; he remembered that&#xD;
Hector was the son of a gentleman, and that Charlotte was a&#xD;
servant. He had observed their intimacy; and now Hector was&#xD;
abroad on her business. " The next thing will be a marriage!"&#xD;
He expressed his thoughts to his wife ; he did not conceal them&#xD;
from- Charlotte. Still, she had no condemnation for him, but&#xD;
much compassion. She sought his good-will; she exerted herself&#xD;
to please him; and often 'there was a charmabout her which not&#xD;
even he could resist.&#xD;
One day, having dressed his wound as usual, she asked permis-&#xD;
sion to comb his hair. He answered that he could never endure&#xD;
any person to touch it; but her tone, her smile, and the winning&#xD;
assurance with which she brought the brush and comb, quite dis-&#xD;
armed his ill-nature. Never was experiment more successful.&#xD;
There was certainly a magnetism in her touch; for, so far from&#xD;
beig irritated, he felt only a soothing influence. The invalid&#xD;
looked on in mild delight, to see Charlotte do, with such per-&#xD;
feet ease and grace, what had never before been accomplished.&#xD;
Unfortunately, Corny's ever-recurring head was put in at the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"'S a man out here. Do'no' what he wants; guess he 'd like&#xD;
to hire out. Said he 'd saw for me- if I'd come in an' tell ye."&#xD;
"Tell me what ?"&#xD;
"Do'no'; did n't say," drawled Corny.&#xD;
The boy was sent about his business, with an injunction to&#xD;
enter the house with no more such meaningless errands. But in&#xD;
five minutes the indefatigable head reappeared.&#xD;
"Tol' me to come in an' tell'ye !"&#xD;
*" To tell us what'?" .&#xD;
" Did n't say; J can't git nothin' out on him. Guess it 's&#xD;
Charlotte he wants; for he said 't wan't you nor Mis' Dunbury,&#xD;
&#xD;
AN UNWELCOME GUEST.                  259&#xD;
nor Bridget, nuther ; an' when I axed if 't was Charlotte, his eyes&#xD;
looked --I can't tell how, but real funny, an' he called me Tele-&#xD;
scope. That 's all; an' he made me come in an' tell ye."&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury answered with a look, which Corny understood,&#xD;
and he withdrew muttering. Charlotte continued her task. But&#xD;
the charm was 'broken. Her hand had grown nervous, and Mr.&#xD;
Dunbury's equanimity was destroyed. Another reappearance of&#xD;
Corny. Charlotte looked pale. Mr. Dunbury looked very red.&#xD;
"I do'no' what to do. I can't git red on him. He keeps&#xD;
makin' me come an' tell ye. I never see sich a man. He can't&#xD;
saw wood more 'n a hen; and he 's mos' broke the saw a'ready."&#xD;
With a fiery expression Mr. Dunbury arose.&#xD;
" Let, me go ! " cried Charlotte. In the wood-shed she found&#xD;
the incomprehensible visitor. He, was making violent efforts to&#xD;
extricate the saw, which had become pinched in the stick he was&#xD;
cutting, notwithstanding the handfuls of snow- he had put in to&#xD;
facilitate the movement.&#xD;
"Edward!"&#xD;
He looked up, took off his hat, and, drawing up his meagre&#xD;
figure with great dignity, made a profound obeisance.&#xD;
"Salutation, your majesty ! I abdicate the saw-horse! I&#xD;
hope my appearance is not premature. I am unused to state&#xD;
occasions."&#xD;
"You've e'en-a-jest broke the saw ! " muttered Corny.&#xD;
" Verification'!." whispered Edward, with a keen glance. " If&#xD;
dissatisfied, you can appeal. But say no more, and here 's a but-&#xD;
ternut for you."&#xD;
4 do' want none o' yer butt'nuts !  I s'pose I shall be&#xD;

"Broken teeth -so shall truth be delivered!  Acts have&#xD;

"I little suspected to see you again so soon," said Charlotte.&#xD;
" Where are yoi. from, to-day ?"&#xD;
"From Siberia, the land of exile ! " answered the prime minis-&#xD;

lamented the marriage; but I did not envy the prince. So - or&#xD;

The sitting-room door was opened, and Mr. Dunbury appeared.&#xD;
"Edward Longman ! how came you here?"&#xD;
"What shall I say?" asked the prime minister, aside. "Can I&#xD;
mention the Seven Wise Men?"&#xD;
"No, Edward. Tell him you walked, if you did walk."&#xD;
"I walked, if I did walk, your honor ! "-- and, bowing pro-&#xD;
foundly, Edward looked to Charlotte for her approbation.&#xD;
A shadowy scowl passed over the wintry landscape of Mr.&#xD;
Dunbury's face, as he made a motion for the wanderer to go in.&#xD;
"=Welcome is the honey of souls," remarked Edward, " but&#xD;
dark looks are gall. Thank your honor. In our kingdom there&#xD;
shall be schools of the virtues, and hospitality shall be taught&#xD;
before ciphering.  I engage you as a professor.  There 's a&#xD;
smiling face," scrutinizing Mrs. Dunbury, who held out her hand&#xD;
to him from her easy-chair; "but we are not what we seem.&#xD;
Experience is the mother of caution."&#xD;
" Have you forgotten me, cousin?"&#xD;
"I should do ill to forget so venerable -a lady ! And here 's a&#xD;
shake for you ! "&#xD;
Mrs. Dunbury invited him to be seated, and inquired about his&#xD;
family.&#xD;
"They are well, for a family of sinners. The old lady has&#xD;
experienced a miraculous cure."&#xD;
"Your mother? "&#xD;
"Whom they called my mother. Disease has vanished, and&#xD;
she enjoys rest; bless her dear old soul ! "&#xD;
''How do you mean?"&#xD;
"0, death is your only doctor ! She put off mortality nine&#xD;
days ago. Let fools weep at funerals; the wise will take hoh-&#xD;
day. It 's a weairy world ; and all who .live sin, and all who sin&#xD;
suffer. I could name an exception; for one soul is exempt. Or if&#xD;
ever he suffers?"- the prime minister laid his hand upon his breast,&#xD;
bowing graciously, -" it is from spare diet, thin clothes, and the&#xD;
Ssins of others ! But he bears up, thanks to a sound mind in a sound&#xD;

body, and to the Seven Wise Men. I 've eaten nothing since yes-&#xD;
terday, and I've tramped through snow and through water."&#xD;
He glanced downwards to his 4oots, which were thin, red, and&#xD;
saturated; and the expression of his face was wild, and weary,&#xD;
and haggard. Mrs. Danbury questioned him concerning his&#xD;
mother ; but he shook 'his head thoughtfully, still gazing at his&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
" Give him some dry socks," muttered Mr. Dunbury, " and let&#xD;
Bridget set out a luncheon. I 'd rather have seen the cholera enter&#xD;
the house ; but while he remains he must be cared for."&#xD;
"Thank you, professor !"  Edward looked up, with a bright&#xD;
expression. " When I go, the cholera shall come. The cramps&#xD;
are jolly! Then you'll think of me!"&#xD;
And he laughed a light, airy, hollow laugh, which chilled the&#xD;
blood to hear. His eyes followed Charlotte, as she passed from&#xD;
the room; then, moving over to Mrs. Dunbury, he put his hand to&#xD;
his mouth, and whispered, mysteriously,&#xD;
" She 's a queenly figure ! But where 's the bridegroom? I&#xD;
am to omit all titles, or I would call him Prince Hector.. 'T was&#xD;
an illustrious marriage, but there was an attempt at secrecy."&#xD;
" What are you talking about ?" demanded Mr. Dunbury.&#xD;
" State policy ! I suspected his second visit ; and they could&#xD;
not deceive me ! She had been two weeks preparing. They&#xD;
knew my opinions of marriage, and feared my opposition. But I&#xD;
was at the church before them. Ha ! you look troubled ! "&#xD;
" Dismiss Charlotte from your mind, and dry your feet by the&#xD;
fire," said Mrs. Dunbury.&#xD;
" Evasion ! You are the queen-mother ; and you fear treason.&#xD;
I have no griefs; but I liked not that the ceremony should be&#xD;
mean and obscure. I would have had it grand and imposing.&#xD;
The guests are met, the feast is set, mayst hear the merry din !&#xD;
So I cried wo ! three times,.and heard it echo in the roof. You&#xD;
are the bridegroom's father."&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury turned upon his wife.    Her looks betrayed&#xD;
her. The shadow on his face became that of a thunder-cloud.&#xD;
" This means something ! And you are not ignorant ! What&#xD;
is it ? What of Hector and Charlotte ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
AN UNWELCOME GUEST.                  263&#xD;
Edward laughed. "Excellent artifice! But no deception.&#xD;
They had two witnesses at the church; and I made a third. I&#xD;
was the guest that had not on a wedding garment."&#xD;
His wild words were cut short by the appearance of Charlotte.&#xD;
"What is this, I say?" roared Mr. Danbury. "Have I been&#xD;
duped' Has my son married my servant?"&#xD;
Charlotte reeled and clung to the door for support..&#xD;
" Mr. Dunbury! -husband!- father!- in the name of&#xD;
nercy," pleaded the invalid, "be gentle with the child ! If fault&#xD;
there be, it is not hers, - it is Hector's - mine ! Do not kill&#xD;
her ! "&#xD;
The prayer was unheeded. The purple rage in Mr. Dunbury's&#xD;
face, and the bursting fury of his speech, struck Charlotte down,&#xD;
as at a blow. With.a faint cry of anguish, she loosed her hold,&#xD;
and fell to the floor. The invalid, tottering forward, essayed to&#xD;
raise her in her arms. Edward set up a shout.&#xD;
" Ha ! ha ! ha !  The world is topsy-turvy! They would&#xD;
cheat me of my wit; but artifice, avaunt ! 'T was I that hid in&#xD;
the church, and groaned behind the organ !&#xD;

BROTHER AND SISTER.&#xD;
THE " Fair Nun's Complaint " remained a poetical fragment.&#xD;
The young authoress felt no more inspiration for the subject,&#xD;
from  the memorable evening of the rhymes; and after several&#xD;
unsuccessful attempts to complete the sixth stanza, she tore the&#xD;
manuscript.&#xD;
" Why'!" exclaimed Mrs. Greenwich, "what makes you do so?&#xD;
How sorry I am ! They were very pretty varses, I am sure."&#xD;
"I never wrote anything so dull in my life !" exclaimed Etty.&#xD;
"0, now ! You need n't think so ! You should have patience.&#xD;
Can't you remember the varses, and write them off ? "&#xD;
" If I could, I would n't ! "&#xD;
"Why, my child, I am     surprised !  How  can you be so&#xD;
unladylike ?  What would your father say ?  Here, give me that&#xD;
other piece ; these go together, don't they ? What word is that&#xD;
torn off?  I can make out all of one varse but that ; and it 's&#xD;
very touching, seems to me. I don't know when I've seen such&#xD;
good poetry anywhere. 'The moonbeams 'neath the convent&#xD;
dashing, my tears are glittering on the roof,'-- those are very&#xD;
beautiful words !"&#xD;
" It is n't so ! " cried Etty, attempting to snatch the paper.&#xD;
" 0! " said her mother, "I have n't matched the pieces right!&#xD;
It's the moonbeams that glitter, and the waves that dash; but I&#xD;
am sure it reads well either way. Now, do you sit down and&#xD;
finish it for the Green Mountain Herald; everybody will admire&#xD;
it in print, and then your father will praise you."&#xD;
But Etty only took the fragments to put them into the fire.&#xD;

more human on that account. From her infancy her heart had&#xD;
felt a hungering for love; and her hopes and affections had&#xD;
centred in her brother, unworthy as he was. His indifference&#xD;
gave her pain, without lessening her attachment ; and when he&#xD;
was unkind to her, she was more ready to accuse herself than&#xD;
him. But the most cruel test to which her love had ever been&#xD;
put was the blow with which he sent her from him that night.&#xD;
When the bitter memory swelled in her heart, it seemed almost&#xD;
bursting with anguish. Unfortunately, she was kept from school,&#xD;
to be under her father's immediate instruction; and she had no&#xD;
companions. Indeed, there was but one person whose sympathy&#xD;
she much desired. That person was Charlotte Woods, whose&#xD;
kindness she so gratefully remembered. But she did not know&#xD;
that Robert ever went to Mr. Dunbury's now; and if he did,&#xD;
there was no hope that he would take her with him. So her only&#xD;
consolation was to brood silently over her grief by day, and by&#xD;
night to sigh and weep upon her wretched pillow.&#xD;
In this state of mind, Etty naturally preferred solitude to the.&#xD;
company of the family. But it was winter, and her mother would&#xD;
not suffer her to sit in the cold rooms.  Generally, however, there&#xD;
was a fire in Robert's chamber ; and, when he was absent, she used.&#xD;
to get permission to sit up there alone, pretending to take advan-&#xD;
tage of the quiet, to study her lessons. She was careful that&#xD;
Robert should not find her there ; listening for his footsteps, and&#xD;
gliding softly away at his approach.  One evening, however,&#xD;
having ensconced herself in a favorite position by the window,&#xD;
where she could gaze at the moon, and drawn the curtains about&#xD;
her in a manner completely to exclude the light of the lamp, she&#xD;
gave such free rein to her fancy, that, wandering far off into the&#xD;
regions of ideal hopes and sorrows, it somehow lost itself, and&#xD;
passed, unconsciously, into the realm of dreams. Nature had&#xD;
long been cheated of her proper repose by the young girl's melan-&#xD;
choly; and now she took ample revenge. Etty's head had sunk&#xD;
upon her arm, and her sleep was profound. She dreamed that&#xD;
R   ert and Charlotte were married, and that she went to lve&#xD;
;; with them, and was very happy ; the only- trouble being that&#xD;
 teir house was discovered to be a convent, and that her new&#xD;

sister turned out to be a nun, who was in great distress because&#xD;
she was to be printed, for general circulation, in the Green Moun-&#xD;
tain Herald. It was Robert who had condemned her to that&#xD;
punishment, for wearing his white satin waistcoat to a sewing.&#xD;
circle in the village ; an offence nuns had a passion for commit.&#xD;
ting, notwithstanding the fatal consequences. Etty went to him&#xD;
to plead Charlotte's cause ; when he struck her so violent a blow&#xD;
with the warrant he was signing, that -  she awoke.&#xD;
She started in terror ; for the place seemed strange to her, and&#xD;
she heard voices.in the room. Then came the shock of conscious-&#xD;
ness: he remembered where she was: she had been asleep, and&#xD;
Robert had returned ! He was not alone ; he .had one or two&#xD;
companions; Etty could not tell tit first-how many. The lamp&#xD;
found burning on his table did not surprise him ; for often, when&#xD;
he was out, Etty had left alight for him, on going to bed. But&#xD;
it was now late, the oil was low, and the dim flame cast but a&#xD;
feeble ray in the chamber. Added to this, was the fact that the&#xD;
window where the child sat was partly concealed by the bed. In&#xD;
her first tremor of affright, Etty had not the courage to discover&#xD;
herself: she waited to still the fluttering of her heart, and to&#xD;
gather breath and strength; and the longer she waited the more&#xD;
terrible her situation became. She heard words which she knew&#xD;
she ought not to hear. Robert had introduced his companion&#xD;
into his chamber, at that secret hour, that even the circumstance'&#xD;
of their conferring together might be hidden from all the world.&#xD;
And there sat the young girl, an unwilling listener to all that was&#xD;
said! A -glimpse she had of some great danger that hung over&#xD;
one she loved added intensity-to her fears.  What the danger&#xD;
was, she could not fully comprehend; but it appeared none the&#xD;
less awful for the mystery in which it was veiled. Then the&#xD;
child remembered the dream from which she awaked but now, so&#xD;
seemingly absurd, yet so seemingly prophetic ; and felt cold shud-&#xD;
ders of dread creep over her, as she thought of- Charlotte !&#xD;
How long the interview lasted, Etty had no means of judging.&#xD;
It would have been difficult for her to believe that so much suffer-&#xD;
ing as she experienced could be compressed within the brief space&#xD;
of an hour. It seemed prolonged through the whole of a long&#xD;
&#xD;
BROTHER AND SISTER.                  267&#xD;
winter's night. At last Robert conducted his companion from&#xD;
the room; she heard them go softly down stairs, heard a door&#xD;
open and close, heard her father cry out from his bed-chamber&#xD;
" Who is there?" and heard Robert answer, "I am after a glass&#xD;
of water." But by this time the child stood trembling in her&#xD;
own chamber: she had arrived there without knowing how : she&#xD;
had never any recollection of passing from room to room. She&#xD;
waited until she saw the shimmer of Robert's lamp on the land-&#xD;
ing, and heard his door close after him; then shrank away in her&#xD;
dreary room to her bed, and covered her head, shivering with&#xD;
terror and cold.&#xD;
Etty thought it must now be near morning. But she had long&#xD;
hours yet to wait. How often she looked from beneath the clothes,&#xD;
to see the glimmer of gray light on the walls ! - At last, at last,&#xD;
it came: the slow, reluctant dawn peeped in at the window. Her&#xD;
room was on the opposite side of the house from her brother's,&#xD;
looking towards the north ; and, as soon as it was light enough&#xD;
to see, she got up and gazed anxiously down the valley. It was&#xD;
a mild winter's morning; the eaves dripped with the melting snow.&#xD;
Yet the earth was white, and the road leading towards Mr. Dun-&#xD;
bury's house looked desolate and forbidding. How was she to&#xD;
traverse it, to get to Charlotte ?  She dared not tell her mother&#xD;
where she wished to go, lest Robert should learn of it, and guess&#xD;
her purpose; and the only way seemed to be, to plan an escape&#xD;
from the house, and then, on foot and alone, to travel that lonely&#xD;
track to save her friend.&#xD;
A plan was easily invented. Her newly-married cousins, the&#xD;
Crestons, lived a little out of the village, although in an opposite&#xD;
direction from that she wished to go. For some time she had&#xD;
been planning to make them a visit, and she would ask permission&#xD;
of the mother to go that day.&#xD;
The permission was asked, and granted. But her father's sanc-&#xD;
tion was necessary to render it valid. His decision was, that,&#xD;
provided she would have her lessons to recite when he came home&#xD;
to dinner, she might go to her cousin's in the afternoon. Etty was&#xD;
in despair; for the afternoon would be too late ; and her father's&#xD;
decisions were unalterable. Fortunately, her pale looks, discolored&#xD;

eyes, and want of appetite, attracted his attention at the break-&#xD;
fast-table.&#xD;
"Daughter, are you in your usual health this morning?"&#xD;
"Yes, father."  Etty's voice faltered, and her eyes fell; for&#xD;
Robert had appeared, and it seemed to her that he could read her&#xD;
burning secret.&#xD;
" How late did you study, last night?"&#xD;
"Not - very late."&#xD;
" You should n't study a minute after eight o'clock, my child,"&#xD;
said the mother. " You have n't been well, these three weeks;&#xD;
and I believe it 's nothing in the world but -"&#xD;
"Mrs. Greenwich," interrupted the paternal head, " I was&#xD;
speaking!"&#xD;
Mrs. G., with alacrity: "I hear you, Mr. Greenwich."&#xD;
The paternal head nodded approvingly, and turned to Etty.&#xD;
" Daughter, when ,that you requested permission to visit your&#xD;
cousins, it would have been your desire to go this forenoon; but,&#xD;
upon hearing the paternal decision, you maintained a respectful&#xD;
silence, as was befitting. Your dutiful behavior merits indul-&#xD;
gence ; and, in consideration of your application to your books, I&#xD;
have weighed the matter, and resolved to reward you with a day's&#xD;
recreation."&#xD;
Etty, tremulously: " Thank you, father."&#xD;
" If Robert has nothing to do -" began the mother.&#xD;
" Mrs. Greenwich," said the paternal head, with severe deliber-&#xD;
ation, " if it is your design to usurp the conversation, I will hold&#xD;
my peace."&#xD;
" 0, by no means ! Go on, Mr. Greenwich ! I was only going&#xD;
to make the remark -never mind !"&#xD;
" Son Robert," then said the 'Squire, " you will oblige me by&#xD;
carrying your sister over to your cousins' in the cutter."&#xD;
" If my sister will accept my escort," replied Robert, bowing&#xD;
deferentially, "nothing will afford me greater pleasure."&#xD;
Etty dared not raise her eyes. "I can walk, as well-"&#xD;
" Daughter, since the paternal head has decided, is itfitting&#xD;
that you should make remarks ?"&#xD;
Poor Etty could not say one word, Nothing was left her, but&#xD;

to await Robert's motions, and trust to some kind chance, for&#xD;
.R    which she tremblingly prayed,.to favor her escape to Charlotte.&#xD;
It was an hour before lie was ready to accompany her. The snow&#xD;
was thawing fast; in many places the road was broken by hoofs;&#xD;
and he drove very slowly. Arrived in sight of their cousins', she&#xD;
besought him to go no further, but to set her down, and leave her&#xD;
to walk the remaining distance.&#xD;
"Bless your dear heart! "he said, sarcastically, "how extremely&#xD;
anxious you are to get rid of me, this morning ! "&#xD;
"I make you so much trouble -"&#xD;
"Trouble ? On the contrary, in the fond hope of giving you&#xD;
pleasure,"  with a vein of mockery in his tones, --" I had con-&#xD;
cluded to make a visit with you, and have a game of chess with&#xD;
Charley's wife, after dinner."&#xD;
Etty hoped he did but jest; but when he ordered his horse to&#xD;
the stable, and, entering the house with her, declared gayly that he&#xD;
" whad come over to read Tom Moore, and to beat his fair cousin at&#xD;
a game of chess, the child's heart sank, and she almost cried out&#xD;
with despair, as she thought of Charlotte.&#xD;

FLIGHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
RECOVERING from her swoon, Charlotte put her friend gently&#xD;
from her, and, holding her hand upon her heart with an expression&#xD;
of unutterable suffering, withdrew quietly to her chamber.&#xD;
"The gentleman's victuals is ready," said Bridget at the door.&#xD;
S Truth is eternal; but cooking is a necessary evil; " and&#xD;
Edward arose with alacrity. " When the state of innocence is&#xD;
reached, men will winter upon acorns and dried snails. Mean,&#xD;
while greatness must crunch ! Lead the way, Elephant's-foot!&#xD;
If I fast too long, the hungry tiger haunts me; but after the lunch,&#xD;
Solon will shine out."&#xD;
The invalid lay, pallid, and sighing at long intervals, upon the&#xD;
lounge.&#xD;
" You, then," burst forth her husband, "you have encouraged&#xD;
the imposition, you have helped to make me a dupe, you have&#xD;
countenanced your son's folly! "&#xD;
0, sir," cried the invalid, rising slowly upon her arm, and&#xD;
answering his furious look with a sad and earnest glance, "it was&#xD;
in fear of a worse folly, of which you are not ignorant, that I con-&#xD;
sented to the marriage. Look at Edward !- then think of Hector,.&#xD;
who inherits the same blood, the same dangerous temperament,&#xD;
from our ancestors ! 0, what is family pride, compared with the&#xD;
welfare of a heart and mind like his? - And think of Charlotte!&#xD;
consider how tender, and lovable, and true, she is ; and that Hec-&#xD;
tor's feelings, with all their depth and intensity, have centred in&#xD;
her; then, for his sake, if not for her sake, be merciful ! "&#xD;
"What does talk amount to ?   Go on till. dooms-day ; make&#xD;
Hector a saint, make Charlotte an angel, make me a brute! then&#xD;

show one tangible excuse,-the shadow   of reason, - why I&#xD;
should have been duped!"&#xD;
"0, would I could explain ! But when Hector went to bring&#xD;
Charlotte back, and when we both longed to tell you their history&#xD;
up to that hour, he could not approach you-- I could not!"&#xD;
" Was I so terrible a monster?"&#xD;
"You force me to say what I would leave unsaid! When you&#xD;
are yourself, you are to me a husband,-- to him, a father. But&#xD;
there are times when you are not yourself, as you know ! "&#xD;
The quiet tone in which the invalid uttered the notorious truth&#xD;
of her husband's inebriety for a moment staggered him, and&#xD;
left him quivering with inarticulate rage.&#xD;
" No one wished to deceive you; but, considering your state,&#xD;
we deemed it advisable to wait until Charlotte's affairs were&#xD;
settled -But .of this I cannot speak; you would not hear me,&#xD;
you would not understand ; and I must leave the rest to Rector,&#xD;
on his return. Would he were here to-day !"&#xD;
" So say I ! " and the inebriate stamped the floor with his&#xD;
infuriate heel.&#xD;
" You forget," said Mrs. Dunbury, " that he is of an age to act&#xD;
for himself."&#xD;
" And let him ! Had he chosen a negress or a squaw, he might&#xD;
have married in spite of me. But when he thinks to harbor his&#xD;
baggage under my roof, -he shall see!"&#xD;
" He will be quite ready, sir, to remove his wife to another and&#xD;
pleasanter home, let me assure you; and, no doubt, Charlotte will&#xD;
be as ready to go. Why did they come back here at all? Was it&#xD;
not for, my sake, and for your sake? because you needed him, and&#xD;
I needed both ? Had they acted only for themselves, your house&#xD;
would never have been insulted by their presence, as you complain !&#xD;
Young, strong, courageous, they can spare us very well; it re-&#xD;
mains to be seen J ow well we can spare them."&#xD;
"It 's Miss Charlotte I 'd be findin'," said Bridget at the door.&#xD;
" There's a visitor for her," - scratching her elbow, and glancing&#xD;
about the room. Having seized the opportunity to look in upon&#xD;
an interesting family scene, she was in no hurry to retire. Mr.&#xD;
D)unbury breathed hard.&#xD;

"A visitor?" said the invalid.&#xD;
Bridget scratched the other elbow, grinning with conscious im-&#xD;
pertinence.  " Yes 'm -it 's the little janus -what ye cahl her&#xD;
Mr. Robert's sister."&#xD;
" Etty ! who is with her ?"&#xD;
"It's nobody at ahl wid her, but her own silf jist ! It 's aione&#xD;
an' a cryin' she is; an' her fate 's as soppin' wet as iver they can&#xD;
be, wid the thahin' snow. I 've got her by the stove, an' the&#xD;
quair gentleman 's tellin' her the crackin'est stories ! But she 's&#xD;
ahl in the fidgets to see Miss Charlotte; an' she 'll not be thinkin'&#xD;
of her soakin' fate, nor nothin' at ahl, a bit.! "&#xD;
Etty's large forehead and pale face emerged from the eclipse of&#xD;
Bridget's shoulder. Mrs. Dunbury called her, and she came&#xD;
eagerly into the room.  " I want to see Miss Woods ! Is she in&#xD;
her chamber ?  Can I go and find her ? "&#xD;
"Sit down, my. dear. child, and Bridget will speak to' her for&#xD;
you. How wet your dress is !"&#xD;
" Yes -and I must go right back !"  Etty began to cry.  "I&#xD;
would n't care, but I don't know what my mother will say! I&#xD;
was at my cousins'- I had something to tell Miss Woods - 0,&#xD;
if you will let me go and find her ! I know her room!"&#xD;
The invalid gave her consent, and the child hastened to climb&#xD;
the chamber-stairs, and knock with her trembling hand at Char-&#xD;
lotte's, door. Then, having thrust Bridget from the room, Mr.&#xD;
Dunbury stood fuming before the invalid's lounge.&#xD;
" I'll know the rest ! Who are my son's connections ? Who&#xD;
is this adventuress?  Is she so much worse than a beggar, that&#xD;
you dare not speak?  Is she some creature who has first brought&#xD;
shame upon her own family, then upon mine?  Has Hector gone .&#xD;
to appease the anger of an outraged parent, .or the vengeance of a&#xD;
dishonored-husband?  Has the name of Dunbury come to this.? "&#xD;
"It is well for you, sir, to speak of the name of Dunbury! -&#xD;
you, who have done so much for it ! "&#xD;
The words pierced and stung. The proud Englishman writhed&#xD;
a moment, then burst forth with redoubled fury. In the very&#xD;
hurricane of his speech, the door was again opened. Charlotte&#xD;
entered. .She was very pale, her lips were colorless, her eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
FLIGHT.                       278&#xD;
looked wild and strange. She had on her bonnet and shawl, as if&#xD;
for a journey.&#xD;
" Charlotte!" the invalid cried out.&#xD;
"Will you let Cornelius carry me over Wild River in the&#xD;
sleigh ?"&#xD;
"My child! where are you going?"&#xD;
"I could walk," said Charlotte, -- " but there is water around&#xD;
the bridge : beyond that, I shall need no' assistance."&#xD;
The invalid saw Etty's frightened face behind the door. Some-&#xD;
thing like the truth flashed upon her. She glanced despairingly&#xD;
from Charlotte to her husband.&#xD;
" Cornelius can go - can he not - to the river-- "&#xD;
"To the river, - to the end of creation ! "&#xD;
Charlotte spoke a hasty word of thanks, which died in her&#xD;
throat, and hurried from the room. Mrs. Dunbury followed to&#xD;
the hall. A few incoherent and terrified words passed between&#xD;
them; and Charlotte, bursting from the other's trembling embrace,&#xD;
went swiftly from the house.  Bridget was calling Corny, but&#xD;
no Corny appeared.&#xD;
"0 , Bridget, I cannot wait ! -I will walk!"&#xD;
" He 's gahn ahf wid the quair gintleman," scolded Bridget.&#xD;
"But I can be tacklin' the hoss for ye, -if that 's ahl, - an'&#xD;
dhrive ye ahf, into the bargain."&#xD;
"0 !" said Charlotte, " if you will!"&#xD;
"Let me help! " cried Etty.&#xD;
" No, child !-- stay with Mrs. Dunbury. And may God bless&#xD;
you, my dear, dear Etty!"&#xD;
Bridget preceded Charlotte to the )arn. This was a species&#xD;
of stable and wagon-house combined, with two doors on the&#xD;
side of the street, and with' light and space within to harness a&#xD;
team.&#xD;
"Wat n'ise was that ?" asked Bridget, standing agape at the&#xD;
entrance of the smaller door.&#xD;
" Bridget," said Charlotte, with singular earnestness, " I believe&#xD;
you love me!"&#xD;
"Ye may well say that same, Miss Charlotte ! Ye 's the very&#xD;
fust Yankee woman iver I -"&#xD;

Good, Bridget! I knew it was so ! And now that I have&#xD;
only you to depend upon, you will-you will help me, I am sure!"&#xD;
Bridget pledged herself with true Hibernian enthusiasm. "But&#xD;
what shall I be afther doin' for a beginnin'?"&#xD;
" Get out the horse ! Do not waste i minute ! "&#xD;
" Howly Mither ! there 's that n'ise again ! It 's somebody&#xD;
that 's been murthered!!"  It was a muffled cry, that appeared to&#xD;
proceed from the direction of the granary.&#xD;
It is Cornelius," said Charlotte.&#xD;
" The owl!" cried Bridget; "he 's been lockin' himself up, wid&#xD;
the kay on the outside !"&#xD;
" Open for him ! 0, be quick ! "&#xD;
" But what if he should n't be Carny ? What if he 's only pur-&#xD;
tendin' to be there, an' it's a robber afther ahl? 'T would be jist&#xD;
one o' Carny's thricks ! "&#xD;
The cries increased. Corny began to kick and pound. There&#xD;
could be no doubt concerning his identity. Still, Bridget was&#xD;
cautious, and Charlotte unlocked the door. Corny came out,&#xD;
rubbing his eyes, and winking at the light.&#xD;
" Ye 're a pooty feller, to be alluz locking' yerself up when ye 're&#xD;
wanted !" exclaimed the indignant Bridget. " Coom an' be after&#xD;
helpin' wid the harness."&#xD;
" I did n't lock myself up! I went in arter some oats for ol'&#xD;
Maj., when that con-founded -"    The speech was interrupted,&#xD;
Corny stumbling over a measure, and sprawling upon the floor.&#xD;
" I swan ! " -gathering himself up, slowly, - " if there an't that&#xD;
'ere half-bushel, 't I was lookin' fur, when that chap that broke the&#xD;
saw come an' shet the door on to me, an' locked me in! I 'd like&#xD;
to find him once,=- arter I git the oats ! "&#xD;
Charlotte entreated Corny to leave the oats, and assist in put-&#xD;
ting the horse before the cutter.&#xD;
" Which hoss did Mist' Danbury tell ye to take?"&#xD;
" Ould Maj., av coorse," replied Bridget. "ID' ye think I 'd&#xD;
be drivin' the brute that rips up the wagons?" &#xD;
" You! a good 'eal you '11 drive ! B'sides, Maj. had n't oughter&#xD;
go till he 's had his oats."&#xD;
The delay was torturing to Charlotte. The close air of the barn&#xD;
&#xD;
FLIGHT.                       275&#xD;
stifled her; all things grew dark around her, and she groped her&#xD;
way to the door. Supporting herself by the beam, she breathed&#xD;
the open air, and felt the cold dashing of the eaves upon her&#xD;
neck. A sound of hoofs and runners startled her. She looked&#xD;
up. Three men in a sleigh were driving into the yard. They&#xD;
stopped; two of them jumped out, and entered the house by the&#xD;
front door; the third remained without.&#xD;
One of those men Charlotte knew. The sight of him sent a&#xD;
chill through her veins. Cold drops started upon her brow, as&#xD;
she shrank back, trembling, into the obscurity of the barn. Just&#xD;
then there was a shout of laughter; and some person, who had&#xD;
lain concealed in the cutter, leaped up, shaking the buffalo-robes&#xD;
with frantic glee. Bridget ran shrieking to the door.&#xD;
"Edward -Bridget-" gasped Charlotte.&#xD;
"Faix," cried Bridget, "I was spreadin' up the skin in the cut-&#xD;
ter, when out he jumps from under it, like the divil he is intirely!"&#xD;
"0! be still! " said Charlotte, " or I am lost!"&#xD;
"Ha! conspirators,!" ejaculated Edward, bounding from the&#xD;
sleigh. "There shall be one capital crime: that of high treason.&#xD;
The punishment shall be strangling, and here are the clutches ! "&#xD;
-showing his hooked fingers, as he sprang towards the door.&#xD;
"Let the tiger tickle them!"&#xD;
Charlotte stopped him; she clung to him; she breathed out her&#xD;
fears; she implored him to hear her, to aid her. He struck his&#xD;
forehead with his hand.&#xD;
"Stratagem ! Your majesty shall be saved ! After that, the&#xD;
execution. Leave all to the prime minister ! "&#xD;
"But - Edward-what will you do?"&#xD;
His reply was clear and rapid. It showed a sharp, shrewd wit,&#xD;
which gleamed li, e a lightning-flash on Charlotte's bewildered&#xD;
brain. His plan was a wild one; but in it lay her only hope;&#xD;
and, adopting it desperately, she entreated Corny and Bridget to&#xD;
obey and assist him.&#xD;
"Darned if I know the fust thing -" began Corny.&#xD;
"'Be valiant," cried Edward, "and it shall be revealed. Go to&#xD;
the gate, and the instant we pass, shut it after ! -Lady Bridget,&#xD;
-this way !"&#xD;

Etty glided into the barn. "They have come !" she uttered,--&#xD;
" the same man who was in the room last night -I knew his&#xD;
voice ! 0, make haste! "&#xD;
The traces were hooked; Corny was at the gate; the large&#xD;
door was thrown open; then Edward, leaping into the sleigh by&#xD;
his companion's side, threw the buffalo-robe over her, and drove&#xD;
headlong out of the barn. Shaking the reins, and lashing the&#xD;
horse with the whip, he passed the sleigh in the yard, went&#xD;
Through the gate, grazing the post with the runner, and plied,&#xD;
with furious speed, towards Wild River.&#xD;
The man left in charge of the sleigh shouted the alarm, and&#xD;
sprang to his seat. Fortunately the span was headed the wrong&#xD;
way, and, before he could turn their faces towards the road, Corny&#xD;
had had time, in his moderate manner, to close. the gate. The&#xD;
obstacle brought the sleigh to a sudden halt.&#xD;
" Open, there ! " cried the driver.&#xD;
"Who said so ?" muttered Corny.&#xD;
" Open the gate !" thundered the man, shaking his whip.&#xD;
"Tell me agin, then mabby I '11 hear," said Corny, in an under&#xD;
tone, taking care to get beyond reach of the lash. The man&#xD;
jumped out, making a cut at Corny as he passed. The whistling&#xD;
of the whip started the horses ; and, springing forward, they ran&#xD;
the neap against the gate.  "So much for snappin' yer whip!"&#xD;
said Corny, with a grin. "You '11 have to back up now, or you&#xD;
can't git the gate open."&#xD;
" Smash through it ! " exclaimed a terrible voice, so near Cor-&#xD;
ny's ear, that he jumped as if he had been struck. It was one of&#xD;
the men from the house. He leaped into the sleigh, and gathered&#xD;
up the reins. "01'ar the track, Jones ! I'11 go over that gate&#xD;
as if it was shingles! "&#xD;
"Hold on, Dicks'n !" cried the other. 'Twill be cheaper to&#xD;
open it!"&#xD;
" Out o' the vay !" shouted Dickson. "No time for fool'n'!&#xD;
Give us the whip -jump on ! "&#xD;
He struck the horses smartly. With a bound they brought the&#xD;
neap once more against the gate. The frame splintered, and they&#xD;
went over with a crash. The off-horse, however, unused to such&#xD;
&#xD;
FLIGHT.                       277&#xD;
business, shied in passing, and forced the point of the runner&#xD;
against the post.  Another dead halt; the men cursing, the&#xD;
horses trembling and cringing, Corny grinning at a safe distance.&#xD;
As it was out of the question to think of serving the gate-post as&#xD;
they had served the gate, the men found themselves obliged to&#xD;
follow Corny's original advice, and "back up." This was no easy&#xD;
matter, with the horses' legs entangled in the wreck. They kicked&#xD;
and flung, threatening to tear both harness and sleigh to pieces.&#xD;
But at last the fragments of the gate were either trodden down or&#xD;
thrown out of the way; the sleigh was cleared; and Dickson and&#xD;
his companion, jumping aboard, described a swift circle into the&#xD;
road, making the watery snow fly from the runners as they swept&#xD;
around, and dashed away in pursuit of the fugitives.&#xD;
Old Maj. was no racer ; but Edward "exerted himself so well to&#xD;
develop his latent speed, that the cutter had already passed from&#xD;
sight over the hill. Arrived at the summit,/Dickson and his com-&#xD;
panion beheld the fugitives splashing through the sluggish currents&#xD;
of water that crept around the bridge of Wild River; and a min-&#xD;
ute later old Maj. was seen making vigorous leaps up the steep&#xD;
road that led into the woods. By the time the pursuers had&#xD;
reached the bridge, Edward and his companion had once more&#xD;
disappeared.&#xD;
Through the water and slush dashed the horses and sleigh.&#xD;
Dickson and his friend were bespattered from head to foot. Often&#xD;
the horses slumped through the hard-packed bed of the road, and&#xD;
threw up heavy clods, endangering their own limbs, and the eyes&#xD;
and featuresof the men. But Dickson held the reins and wielded&#xD;
the whip; Dickson cared neither for the horses, his friend, nor him-&#xD;
self; his only thought was to overtake the fugitives, at every risk.&#xD;
Old Maj. was no match for the strong, spirited span; and by&#xD;
the time the pursuers came again in sight, he was beginning to&#xD;
flag, notwithstanding Edward's efforts to keep up his courage with&#xD;
the whip. Escape by direct means became hopeless. As a last&#xD;
Ak     resort, the fugitives turned aside into a rough lumber-track, that&#xD;
wound through the woods. But a worse route bould scarce have&#xD;
been chosen. Mounting a snow-covered acclivity, they reached an&#xD;
impassable chasm, filled with huge, heaped, massive rocks, around&#xD;
&#xD;

a&#xD;
&#xD;
278                FLIGhT.&#xD;
the icy bed of Wild River. Seeing retreat thus cut off, Edward&#xD;
abandoned the track, and struck out among the trees on the bank.&#xD;
But the snow still lay heavy in those gloomy regions. The runners&#xD;
cut deep; it was no easy matter to avoid the roots and trunks, and&#xD;
little.progress had been made, when the horses of the pursuers came&#xD;
bounding up the acclivity, and, wheeling among the trees, dashed&#xD;
alongside the cutter, just at a moment when it was arrested by the&#xD;
bristling tops of a fallen cedar. Dickson jumped into the snow,&#xD;
and scrambled to seize his prey.&#xD;
"Destiny in a tree-top ! ". ejaculated Edward. "Let the vul-&#xD;
tures rage ! I -put my faith in the humming-bird. Come on!"&#xD;
" We '11 come on fast enough ! " cried Jones. " And jest you&#xD;
keep quiet, or you '11 git pitch-bowled down them 'ar rocks, like a&#xD;
cobble-stone ! Make sure of her, Dicks'n ! "&#xD;
"Wal, I reck'n !" muttered Dickson, with gloating deliberation.&#xD;
"When I once get my eyes on a gal, it 's as good as a bear-hug !&#xD;
Here ye be, my perty,!"&#xD;
" Hang on !" exclaimed Jones. " If she 'd been spunky as some&#xD;
gals be, she 'd made a desprit push over them 'ar rocks; it 's what&#xD;
I was 'fraid of. I'm much obleeged to her, for my part."&#xD;
"We'll have a general thanksgiving !" said Dickson, with&#xD;
brutal satisfaction. "One live gal is worth a gang of dead ones.&#xD;
0, you 're safe ; don't squirm; 't an't no use ! Show us yer face,&#xD;
my honey !"&#xD;
He pulled down the buffalo-robe, and pulled up the bonnet;&#xD;
then attempted to lift the head of his struggling captive.&#xD;
" The Wise Men triumphant ! " exclaimed Edward. " The dove&#xD;
was a jackdaw, and the cat pounced upon her own paws ! Look&#xD;
to the feathers ! "&#xD;
"What 's the row ?" cried Jones, rushing to the spot.&#xD;
Edward danced, and, flinging his hat into a tree, made the woods&#xD;
ring with his maniacal laugh.9&#xD;
Dickson dropped 'the bonnet; loosed his hold of the buffalo;&#xD;
stood, stared, -his face a picture of mingled stupefaction and&#xD;
fury, - as, struggling through a large quantity of tangled hair,&#xD;
giggling and gasping, appeared the round, red, ludicrous features&#xD;
of- BRIDGE!&#xD;
&#xD;
XXXIII.&#xD;
ROlUSELESS.&#xD;
"Thii law, Mrs. Dunbury," said Oliver Dole, with the grimace&#xD;
of authority, "the LAW must be put in force. It is a painful&#xD;
duty we have to perform, -but, then, you know, the LAW!"&#xD;
He was a gaunt, bony individual, with a hooked nose, and a&#xD;
massive nether jaw.1 He was the third person of Dickson's party,&#xD;
being an officer resident in the county, who had been selected to&#xD;
give character and dignity to the enterprise. A fitter choice could&#xD;
hardly have been made.  The man was sunk in the officer; the&#xD;
waters of human feeling were in him congealed into the fixed, un-&#xD;
swerving ice of public conscience. But Mrs. Dunbury was a mere&#xD;
woman. She fondly believed that the elements of love and mercy&#xD;
enthroned in the heart were a law above all laws. When Dick-&#xD;
son and his companion rushed in pursuit of the cutter, she clung&#xD;
to Oliver Dole. With clasped hands, with sobs and tears, she&#xD;
pleaded for Charlotte.&#xD;
" She is a being like one of us ! She has all human attributes&#xD;
and feelings!  She is a woman - a wife -my son's wife ; my&#xD;
own beloved child ! Do not subject her to the ignominy, the&#xD;
horror, the death, of such an ordeal. If money can satisfy the&#xD;
claims upon her, they shall be satisfied. Even now my son has&#xD;
gone to treat for her. Spare her, spare him, spare us, this terri-&#xD;
ble exposure !  ou are a man, a citizen; it is in your power to&#xD;
save her !"&#xD;
" Mrs. Dunbury," responded Oliver Dole, with an official smack&#xD;
of his lips, "nothing is in my power that is not the law. I can-&#xD;
not be detained from my duty ; and I charge you, Mrs. Dunbury,&#xD;
not to resist the law !"&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;

280                     HOUSELESS.&#xD;
Still she clung to him. She seemed endowed with a-strength&#xD;
above her own. She would not loose her hold.&#xD;
"Mr. Danbury ! " cried Oliver Dole, " I appeal to you ! "&#xD;
Mr. Danbury stood by, a picture of apoplectic rage. His face&#xD;
was purple, his eyes blood-shot, the muscles of his mouth and&#xD;
throat moved convulsively. He heeded the officer no more than&#xD;
the eaves that dripped.  The latter wrenched away the invalid's&#xD;
hands, and she fell upon the floor.&#xD;
"Mr. Danbury," then said Oliver Dole, "I anticipated nothing&#xD;
of this; and now I call upon you for support in the performance'&#xD;
of riy duty.  If the girl escapes, this resistance may cost you&#xD;
dear. If you have a horse in your stable, I will take it, and&#xD;
follow on."&#xD;
No word from Mr. Danbury ; but, with a look of strangulation,&#xD;
-  clutching his breast as if to free his lungs, -he strode over his&#xD;
wife's prostrate form, and followed the officer from the room. At&#xD;
the entrance to the barn stood Etty, white and trembling. It was&#xD;
well the stanch Oliver did not observe the look she gave him, as&#xD;
he stepped into the stall of the remaining horse. A gleam of hope&#xD;
and joy broke through the pale anxiety of her features when she&#xD;
saw him untie the halter, and lead the animal out.  To slip on a'&#xD;
bridle, and leap upon the horse's back, was the work of a moment&#xD;
for Oliver Dole ; and an instant'after, riding over the broken gate,&#xD;
he joined in the noble chase. Etty clasped her hands, and ran&#xD;
to Mr. Danbury.&#xD;
"Here she is!" she uttered, hurriedly. "It was Bridget that&#xD;
went in the cutter ! Be quick, and hide her somewhere !"&#xD;
As she spoke, from beneath the manger crept a pitiful human&#xD;
figure, slender, bent, and trembling with excessive fear. It was&#xD;
Charlotte. She tottered forward, and fell down at Mr. Dunbury's&#xD;
feet. As she covered her face from his sight, one might have seen&#xD;
that her hand was wounded and bloody. Oliver Dole had crushed&#xD;
it with his iron heel, in leading the horse from the stall. It was&#xD;
doubtful if she had felt the pain at the time. Certainly she was&#xD;
insensible to it now ; but Etty cried out with pity at the sight.&#xD;
"0O, Mr. Dunbury !" said the child, " what can she do ? Don't&#xD;
let them take her away !"&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSELESS.                     281&#xD;
3r.&#xD;
No word yet from   Mr. Danbury; none from Charlotte; but&#xD;
shrinkingly she knelt there, as if it was his wrath alone she feared,&#xD;
and only his forgiveness she implored.&#xD;
"0, Charlotte ! " cried Etty, trying to lift her up ; " there is&#xD;
some place where they cannot find you ! Come ! 0, sir, why do&#xD;
you let her be here?"&#xD;
Mr. Danbury raised his remorseless arm. "Begone ! "-his&#xD;
words flamed and hissed with fury,--"lose yourself, drown your-&#xD;
self, I care not, -but BEGONE!"&#xD;
Charlotte arose and fled.&#xD;
There was a cow-path trodden through the snow, leading across&#xD;
the meadows, over the bridge and along the banks of the stream.&#xD;
This path Charlotte took ; passing in her flight scenes which she&#xD;
had first visited in company with Hector, and which had become&#xD;
linked in her memory with warm and dear associations. But now&#xD;
how changed, how cold, how desolate, were they all ! The snow&#xD;
lay heavy and deep on the interval; the willows were naked and&#xD;
dark ; the stream was blocked with ice. Beyond, frowned the&#xD;
inhospitable forest on the mountain side. The heavens above&#xD;
were leaden, with grayish streaks; and now the slow, dull, wintry&#xD;
rain began to fall.&#xD;
Beyond the bridge, the track threw out branches in several&#xD;
directions; for here, all winter long, Mr. Dunbury's cattle and&#xD;
sheep had been foddered from the stacks in the valley. But the&#xD;
main path led along the banks of the creek ; this Charlotte chose,&#xD;
perhaps because among the willows her flight would be concealed,&#xD;
or it may be that she cherished some half-formed design of reach-&#xD;
ing Mr. Jackwood's house.&#xD;
But the way was rude and difficult for her unaccustomed feet.&#xD;
Since the thaw, the track had been broken through by sharp hoofs;&#xD;
water had settled in the low places ; and often, slipping upon the&#xD;
icy cakes, she fell, hurting her naked hands, bruising her limbs,&#xD;
and saturating her garments in the pools. Then, palpitating and&#xD;
breathless from the shock, she would pause, and glance up and&#xD;
down the wide, white valley, with fearful looks, as if expecting&#xD;
momently to see her pursuers appear.&#xD;
A glimpse she caught of Mr. Jackwood's house in the distance&#xD;

282          .          HOUSELESS.&#xD;
inspired her with courage to keep on.  She saw the red-painted&#xD;
kitchen dimly defined upon the field of snow ; the trees and fences&#xD;
speckling the ground ; the heavy plume of smoke from the chim.&#xD;
ney, trailing low across the plain ; and a vision of hope, and&#xD;
help, and rest, in that humble home, flitted before her mind. But&#xD;
the path by the willows had now dwindled to a scarcely-trodden&#xD;
track.. At each step, her feet sank down in the soft, wet snow.&#xD;
Her efforts to proceed cost all her remaining strength.  Only the&#xD;
desperate extremity in which she was sustained her.  But hope&#xD;
and fear alike failed her at last ; and, having climbed the tangled&#xD;
brush of a valley fence, she fell powerless in the snow, upon the&#xD;
other side.-&#xD;
The short winter's day was drawing to a close. The shades of&#xD;
the solemn hills shut in the plain. A dreary silence reigned,&#xD;
broken only by the lowing of cattle, and the faint, sad bleating&#xD;
of sheep in the distance, the sighing of the wind amongthe wil-&#xD;
lows, and the melancholy drip of the rain. Having got a little&#xD;
rest, -Charlotte summoned her energies for a fresh attempt to&#xD;
traverse the snowy track. But now formidable doubts stood in her&#xD;
way. She had faith in her old friends; but would Mr. Jackwood's&#xD;
house, which had twice received her in its hospitable retreat, be&#xD;
overlooked by her pursuers ? Perhaps already they were there,&#xD;
before her; and, to proceed might be to fall at once into their&#xD;
hands. In her deep perplexity, she crept under the fence, with&#xD;
a wild thought of passing the night in that wretched place. But&#xD;
the rain beat upon her still; her-bruised hands ached from contact&#xD;
with the snow ; and her feet were drenched and cold.&#xD;
The approach of footsteps startled her ; but she dared not look&#xD;
around, nor move ; she lay still as death in her retreat.  The&#xD;
sounds drew near, and presently a dog began to bark, plunging&#xD;
into the snow, close -by where"she lay.&#xD;
" Come here, Rove ! " cried an authoritative voice.&#xD;
It was the voice of Abimelech Jackwood, the younger. The&#xD;
dog ran back, with excited yelps, and jumped upon his arm ; then&#xD;
rushed to the attack again, bristling up, and barking furiously at&#xD;
the object by the fence. Charlotte spoke, " Rover !" Instantly&#xD;
he sprang towards her, with a joyous demonstration ; hesitated at&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSELESS.                     283&#xD;
half way, and ran back again to his master ; whisked about in the&#xD;
snow; and finally, having fulfilled all the requirements of canine&#xD;
etiquette on the occasion, leaped upon her lap, wagging his tail&#xD;
violently, caressing her with his feet, and licking her wounded&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
Abimelech stood at a discreet distance, and cried to Rover to&#xD;
come-there. Charlotte arose to her feet, and called his name.&#xD;
"Hello!" cried Bim; "that you?"&#xD;
She tottered forward.  The boy, not so easily satisfied as the&#xD;
dog, showed a disposition to retire. But, in a few hurried words,&#xD;
she gave him to understand that she was no apparition, -that it&#xD;
was indeed Charlotte who spoke to him,-and that he was not to&#xD;
fear, but to aid her.&#xD;
l5     "Be ye goin' up to the house ?" asked the boy.&#xD;
"Abimelech, some men are hunting for me ! I would rather&#xD;
.tF  die than have them  find me !  And I don't know where -to&#xD;
go!"&#xD;
"Who be they? " demanded Bim, with fored courage, looking&#xD;
7   around. "I'll set Rover on to 'em ! Here!"&#xD;
"Where is your father?"&#xD;
"Up to the house, I guess," replied Bim.&#xD;
a.Will you go for him," said Charlotte; "and tell him Iam&#xD;
here, and tell no one else?"&#xD;
"Yes, I'll go!" cried Bim. " But,"- hesitatingly,- " had n't&#xD;
you better go up to the stack, and wait there? -I'd ruther ye&#xD;
would; I come down here to fodder the steers and lambs, and&#xD;
father told me not to go and look at my muskrat-trap, 'cause 't was&#xD;
goin' to rain. It 's righ' down here ; an' if he knows where I found&#xD;
ye, he 'll s'pect I was goin' there."&#xD;
Charlotte accepted the boy's guidance; and immediately around&#xD;
the bend in the creek, they came in sight of the stack. It was a&#xD;
low, gloomy mass, in{the midst of a dark, trodden space, around&#xD;
the edges of which appeared Abimelech's steers and lambs, feed-&#xD;
ing on wisps of hay he had scattered over the snow. The stack&#xD;
was defended by a fence, on one side of which was a temporary&#xD;
shelter, formed of rails and boards, thatched with straw.&#xD;
."If you 'd like to hide," observed Blin, " I know a place, -&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC8115-00000143"/>&#xD;
284                    HOUSELESS.&#xD;
only I don't want father to find it out, for he tells me not to be&#xD;
makin' holes in the stack."&#xD;
"Is it here? "&#xD;
"I '11 show ye !" and Bim, slipping a couple of rails from their&#xD;
place, crept through the fence, and began to pull away the hay&#xD;
from the stack. A dark cavity was -exposed. " It 's a den I&#xD;
made for me an' Rove ! Once I had a notion o' runnin' away,&#xD;
an' I was goin' to live here, and have him bring me my victuals!&#xD;
It's real slick an' warm in there ! "&#xD;
The opening was extremely narrow, and the cavity itself was&#xD;
small. But it was all Charlotte wished for then. She could not&#xD;
have entered a palace with more grateful emotions.&#xD;
" Shall I leave ye a breathin'-place ?" asked Abimelech, put.&#xD;
ting back the hay. "Hello ! what 's that Rover 's barkin' at ?"&#xD;
He crept around the stack, leaving Charlotte listening breath.&#xD;
lessly in her hiding-place. In a moment he returned, and whis-&#xD;
pered hoarsely in the hay, "There 's a man a coming' with a big&#xD;
hoss-whip ! Say ! is he one of 'em ?"&#xD;
Charlotte knew not what she said, if indeed she uttered any&#xD;
reply. She heard the boy hastily smoothing the hay at the&#xD;
entrance of her cell; then all was still, only the dog barked; and&#xD;
as she strained her ear to listen, the straw beneath her rustled&#xD;
with every throb of her heart.&#xD;
Having climbed the stack, and thrown down a quantity of hay-&#xD;
before the mouth of the .cavity, Bim began to arrange some&#xD;
boards in a manner to shed rain.&#xD;
" Git out ! " growled the man with the whip, making a cut at&#xD;
the dog.&#xD;
" He won't bite ye," cried Bim. "Here, Rove! "&#xD;
" Say, boy ! have ye seen anybody pass this way, within half an&#xD;
hour or so ? "&#xD;
"Pass which way?"&#xD;
"Any way - along by the crick."&#xD;
"What crick? "&#xD;
" Answer my question!"*&#xD;
" I han't ben here half an hour, I should n't think," said&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSELESS.                     285&#xD;
" Look a' here !" thundered Dickson, "none o' yer trash with&#xD;
me ! I cut a boy's trouse's-legs right off with this black snake,&#xD;
t'other day! He was a boy about your size, and his trouse's was&#xD;
stouter stuff than yours, too, I reck'n ! Which way did that gal&#xD;
go?"&#xD;
What gal?" said Bim,. stepping cautiously back upon the&#xD;
stack.&#xD;
Let me reach you with this lash, and I 'II tickle your recol-&#xD;
lections ! You'll look paler than that, when I draw about a&#xD;
quart of blood out of ye ! I mean that gal that come along about&#xD;
twenty minutes ago."&#xD;
" If there was any," - Bin looked very candid, but very pale,&#xD;
-" she must a' come along when I was off arter my traps; or&#xD;
else I should think I 'd seen her."&#xD;
" That won't do, boy !"  Dickson cracked his whip savagely.&#xD;
"1 '11 give ye jest about a minute 'n' a ha'f to think about it ;&#xD;
then, if ye don't walk straight up to the scratch, and spit out&#xD;
what ye know, you may expect to have your clo's cut right off'm&#xD;
your back, and your hide with 'm ! "&#xD;
Then Charlotte heard a sound as of some one climbing the&#xD;
stack-yard fence, and a heavy body jumped down upon the&#xD;
ground at the very entrance to her retreat. There was a shaking&#xD;
in the hay which Bim had thrown before it ; Dickson was kick-&#xD;
ing it open with his foot; he trod it down by the stack.&#xD;
Bim looked anxious, but his wits did not desert him. "If&#xD;
ye 'll help me with these 'ere boards, I'll go up to the house with&#xD;
ye, an' see if she 's been by there."&#xD;
"Where do you live ?"&#xD;
"In that house, up yender."&#xD;
"What's yer name,?"&#xD;
"c Bimn!"&#xD;
" What 's yer whole name?"&#xD;
Bim'lech ! "&#xD;
" What 's yer father's name ?"&#xD;
" His name 's Bim'lech, too !"&#xD;
" Bim'lech what ?"&#xD;
" Bimi'lech Jackwood, of course !"&#xD;
&#xD;

286                    HOUSELESS.-&#xD;
" Jackwood, hey ? she used to live to your house, did n't she?"&#xD;
"Yes, I guess not ! Who used to ?".&#xD;
"We 'll see ! " said Dickson. Having, during the dialogue,&#xD;
struck a match under his coat and lighted a cigar, he inserted the&#xD;
latter between his teeth, and, once more measuring out his whip,&#xD;
cracked it at the boy's ears. "Time 's up ! now, what ye got to&#xD;
say ?"&#xD;
" If you 're goin' to smoke," said Bim, from a safe position,&#xD;
" you better.git over thefence; you '11 set the stack afire. Ow !"&#xD;
as the whip-lash whistled by his face, "you had n't better hit me&#xD;
with that ! There 's father, an' I 'm darned glad !"&#xD;
Dickson changed his tactics ; perhaps because he found threats&#xD;
of no avail; perhaps because the boy had an adroit way of dodg.&#xD;
ing over the stack beyond reach of his whip ; or in consequence,&#xD;
it may be, of misgivings with regard to the parent Jackwood.&#xD;
lie therefore opened a parley, and offered Bim half a dollar to&#xD;
tell him which way Charlotte went.f&#xD;
" I guess so !" said. Bim. "You want me to come down an'&#xD;
git it, then you'll ketch me, an' gi' me a lickin', I know !"  And&#xD;
he made preparations to slide off the opposite side, in case Dick.&#xD;
son attempted to climb the stack.S&#xD;
But Dickson had a more important matter to attend to.&#xD;
Either the match he had thrown down after lighting his cigar,&#xD;
or cinders falling in the hay, had set fire to the heap. The flame,&#xD;
shooting up with a sudden crackling and glare, was the first&#xD;
warning he received of the danger. He had left the spot, and&#xD;
was standing by the cattle-shed, when the blaze caught his eye.&#xD;
He rushed to extinguish it, stamping, and trampling, and calling&#xD;
to the boy to bring snow.S&#xD;
" There an't no fire ! " cried Bim, who thought it a ruse 'to&#xD;
bring him down..&#xD;
"By -     !" said Dickson, "you'll find out whether there 's a&#xD;
fire !"&#xD;
Already Charlotte had smelt the burning straw. Then, through&#xD;
chinks in the opening ofir cell, she caught fearful glimpses of&#xD;
the struggling flame and smoke.' She heard the alarm, the oaths,&#xD;
the trample of feet. The stack was burning !..&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSELESS.                     287&#xD;
Her first impulse was to cry out, and rush from her retreat.&#xD;
But the certainty of falling into the hands of Dickson paralyzed&#xD;
aer tongue, and chained her limbs. Death was nothing ; a&#xD;
moment since, she would have,risked a hundred deaths sooner&#xD;
than be taken; but to be burned, to perish in a slowly consuming&#xD;
mass, to die by torment in a tomb of fire ! the thought was mad-&#xD;
dening ; it filled her with an insensate fear, that caused her for&#xD;
the instant to forget all other danger. With frantic hands&#xD;
she tore the hay that blocked the opening. But a volume of&#xD;
smoke, pouring in upon her, changed her purpose. She thrust&#xD;
back the hay, while at the same time it was trampled and packed&#xD;
from without. She heard the simmer of snow upon the flames; she&#xD;
thought the fire was being extinguished. She hoped, she prayed,&#xD;
that she might yet be preserved.&#xD;
But now the trampling feet, and snow packed down upon the&#xD;
burning hay, drove the smoke into the cell. Charlotte was suffo-&#xD;
cating. The torture almost forced her to cry out. 0, that she&#xD;
might have power to endure yet a little while ! She thought of&#xD;
Hector. For his sake she conquered her agony. Writhing in&#xD;
torment, she clasped her hands upon her face to stifle her own&#xD;
cries. Yet a little while ! yet a little while ! 0, yet one moment&#xD;
more !&#xD;
It could not be. -She fought with death itself. It seemed that&#xD;
almost the last struggle, the last mortal throe, had come. Still&#xD;
Hector filled her soul. She might have endured and died ; but,&#xD;
no ! for him she would risk all things; for him she would suffer&#xD;
on; for him she would live ! Again she tore the hay from the&#xD;
opening of the cell. But the act was forestalled. A hand, thrust&#xD;
in, met hers.&#xD;
" Keep still !" whispered Bim, at the entrance. " Can ye&#xD;
breathe ?"&#xD;
She breathed, she lived, she hoped. The fire was extinguished.&#xD;
Dickson, enraged at the delay, had departed in haste, and the&#xD;
boy was left alone to trample out the smouldering sparks with&#xD;
now-&#xD;

There was no service Bim would more gladly have performed.&#xD;
Anything rather than that Dickson should return to the stack.&#xD;
He looked for the whip, but could not find it. The man had&#xD;
thrown it down whilst extinguishing the fire, and thought it must&#xD;
have become trodden in the hay. He returned; they looked for&#xD;
it together,-- Bim keeping at a respectful distance, and holding&#xD;
himself ready to run the instant the whip appeared,-- Dickson&#xD;
growling and swearing. Suddenly, the end of the lash was dis-&#xD;
covered hanging off the cattle-shed, close by the stack. Dickson&#xD;
seized it ; Abimelech fled ; Charlotte, who had listened all the&#xD;
time with a fluttering heart, began to breathe again. But at the&#xD;
moment there was a movement at the mouth of the cell. The hay&#xD;
was opening; some object forced its way into her retreat. She&#xD;
was shrinking away in terror, when Rover, scrambling through,&#xD;
leaped into her face, and expressed his delight by barking play-&#xD;
fully, licking her hands, and thumping the sides of the niche with&#xD;
his animated tail.&#xD;
Fortunately Dickson had turned again to go, and was at that&#xD;
moment making long strides across the field. Dim returned to&#xD;
Charlotte just in time to bump noses with Rover, who, not&#xD;
liking the smoke, was leaping out of the hay.&#xD;
" He 's gone !" whispered the boy.. "Darn his old whip, I&#xD;
say ! Did ye know he set the stack afire ?"&#xD;
" Did I know it !" murmured Charlotte.&#xD;
I'm all of a tremble yit !" said Bim. "I was a little bit&#xD;
scart; but, confound his picture' ! he did n't find ye, after all, did he?&#xD;
That 's all I care for ! "&#xD;
"And it 's all I care for, now ! I feel faint ! Will you give&#xD;
me a handful of snow ?"&#xD;
The boy brought the snow: she pressed it on her forehead, as&#xD;
she lay panting upon the hay.&#xD;
" Shall I go up an' tell father, now?"&#xD;
" If you will; but be careful, let no one else know -"&#xD;
"I I'll keep it from Pheeb, anyway ! She always tells every-&#xD;
thing. Say ! shall I leave Rover for company ? "&#xD;
A faint " no " was the response ; and the excited boy, having&#xD;
thrown the superfluous hay over the fence, and rearranged that at&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSELESS.                    289&#xD;
the mouth of the cell, leaving only a breathing-place, as he called&#xD;
it, went off whistling, to appear unconcerned. She listened in&#xD;
her retreat; the sounds grew faint and fainter, ceasing at last;&#xD;
and she was left alone, in darkness and silence, hemmed in by the&#xD;
low roof and prickly walls of her cell.&#xD;
For some minutes she lay still, and prayed. In that simple and&#xD;
childlike act neyv strength was given her, and she was enabled to&#xD;
think calmly of her state. She took care of her feet, removing&#xD;
their wet covering, and drying them in the warm hay. Then,&#xD;
finding that Abimelech had shut her in too closely, and that the&#xD;
air of the cell was still poisoned with smoke, she moved the hay&#xD;
from the opening, and lay down upon it, where she could look out&#xD;
upon the thickening darkness, and listen to the sighing wind and&#xD;
pattering rain.&#xD;

XXXIV.&#xD;
THE NIGHT.&#xD;
ThE night. set in, wild and stormy. The rain increased, the&#xD;
gale blew fitfully, the far-off forest roared. With her hands&#xD;
clasped upon her breast, Charlotte lay gazing out into the dark,&#xD;
and listening to the storm, until the night, the wind, and the rain,&#xD;
seemed no longer anything of themselves, but a part of herself,&#xD;
and all within her own soul.&#xD;
"0, heaven ! 0, grief! 0, love ! " were the thoughts that filled&#xD;
her universe.&#xD;
The last glimmer of day had faded, and darkness lay like a&#xD;
thick substance on the earth, when the footsteps she had long&#xD;
expected came plashing through the snow.&#xD;
"6Cha'lotte ! " said the voice of Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
"I am here !" breathed Charlotte, with a joyous thrill.&#xD;
"I 've brought ye some supper, and some dry stockin's,"&#xD;
returned the farmer. "Where be ye ?"&#xD;
"Here!" and Charlotte reached out her hand. "0, Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood !"&#xD;
" It 's a dre'ful tejus night ! " observed the farmer, getting&#xD;
down by the stack. " I wish you was.safe to the house, once."&#xD;
"I wish I was safe somewhere ! But it is all well, good Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood. If I can be kept concealed here --":.&#xD;
"Sence Bim'lech told me o' the hole, I ben thinkin'," said&#xD;
the farmer, "'t would be as well. The men have ben to my&#xD;
house, -two come by the road, an' t' other acrost the leader;&#xD;
an' they '11 be there agin, probably, for they've got the notion&#xD;
that we know   where you be.    Oliver Dole was there, an'&#xD;

the house ; we could n't hender 'em, an' I thought it 'bout as&#xD;
well to let 'em have a good time on 't, long as you wan't there.&#xD;
Take your choice, though," added Mr. Jackwood; "if-ye don't&#xD;
fancy stoppin' here, I'll git ye up to the house some way, and do&#xD;
my best to take care on ye, while ye 're-there."&#xD;
" Let me stay here; I would rather."&#xD;
"How much room ye got? iDear me ! it 's quite a house, an't&#xD;
it ? -I never see the beat o' that boy's-mischief! I 've told him,&#xD;
time an' agin, not to be makin' holes in the stacks; but I guess&#xD;
I '11 let him off easy, seeing' it 's turned out so well for you!"&#xD;
"You know," faltered Charlotte, "why I am here ?"&#xD;
"I kind o' ketched a little on 't, from what was said. But&#xD;
never mind -about that. I 'd as soon think of givin' up my own&#xD;
darter to 'em as you! "&#xD;
Charlotte held the farmer's hard and knotty hand, and kissed it&#xD;
fervently.&#xD;
" You need n't have no fears 'bout .me," he continued, with&#xD;
hearty sympathy. "I guess Bim'lech Jackwood '11 turn out a perty&#xD;
sound kind o' wood, at heart. I told ye so, perhaps you recollect,&#xD;
the fust time 'tever I see ye : 't was in one o' these very meaders,&#xD;
but a leetle furder down. I han't forgot it, if you have. Shall&#xD;
I send word to Mist' Dunb'ry's folks 't you are here?"&#xD;
"0, no ! -unless -unless Hector comes home ! "&#xD;
"Wal, we'll talk o' that to-morrow. Mist' Dunb'ry '11 be&#xD;
harder 'n ever on our country, now. He 's English; and I don't&#xD;
know 't I ever talked with him in the world, 't he had n't some&#xD;
flaw to pick in our institutions. I've kep' up my eend o' the&#xD;
argument perty well, so fur; but I guess he '11 git the start o' me&#xD;
now. I should think he 'd move heaven an''arth to git you clear&#xD;
What did he say about it?"&#xD;
Charlotte's bosom heaved, and the farmer felt her tears fall&#xD;
upon his hand.&#xD;
"Wal, never mind to-night. 0! did I tell ye little Etty&#xD;
Grinnich stopped to our house, on her way hum? That was a&#xD;
good joke, sendin' the kidnabbers carter Bridget, while you got&#xD;
away ! Wal, I don't know as there 's anything more, 'less&#xD;
you 'd like to have me stay with ye a little while, for company."&#xD;

"10, no ! " replied Charlotte. "The rain is dripping on you."&#xD;
" I don't mind the rain a mite. Besides, if you 'd like to have&#xD;
me, I'll git a board off 'm the stack, an' put it down here; then&#xD;
I 'l set\ an' talk, while you 're eatin' your supper."&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood was going for the board, but Charlotte entreated&#xD;
him to give himself no more trouble and discomfort on her ac-&#xD;
count. " Wal, good-night, then. You may depend on seem' some&#xD;
of us 'ary in the mornin'. But it 's dre'ful tough," added the&#xD;
farmer, with compunctions. " The rain '11 turn to snow, and it '11&#xD;
freeze up, tight as a drum, 'bout midnight. I 'm 'fraid you '11 be&#xD;
cold here; an' I d'n'no but you 'd better go up to the house,&#xD;
arter all."&#xD;
"No," said Charlotte. "You have done all you can. I wish&#xD;
I could thank you !-- but - good-night ! "&#xD;
"Wal, good-night it is, then !" returned the farmer. "Keep,&#xD;
up good heart - that 's all I got to say. 'T '11 all be right, ----&#xD;
't'11 all be right, -in the eend."&#xD;
Mr. Jaekwood departed. Charlotte listened, as his footsteps&#xD;
went away in the dreary dark. Then she was once more alone;&#xD;
and the storm beat still, and the wind whistled, and the far-off&#xD;
forest roared.&#xD;
In a thoughtful mood the farmer tramped on through the rain&#xD;
and snow. More than once he stopped, and was on the point of&#xD;
going back for Charlotte. - It seemed to him, as he afterwards&#xD;
confessed, as though " suthin was goin' to happen; " and he could&#xD;
not feel right about leaving her.&#xD;
" But I'll push on up to the house," said he, " any way ; and&#xD;
then see how the weather acts."&#xD;
Arrived, dripping wet, at the kitchen, he was astonished to find&#xD;
a burly, low-browed man sitting before the stove, in an attitude&#xD;
and with looks of dogged discontent. It was Dickson, who, after&#xD;
pretending to depart with his companions, had returned to spend&#xD;
the night in the suspected house..&#xD;
"Why, what does ail you, father?" said Mrs. Jackwood, in&#xD;
the middle of the night. " How narvous you be!"&#xD;
"I 'm consarned about Cha'lotte !" replied the farmer. " I&#xD;

'fore this. If it keeps on rainin', there '11 be a foot o' water on&#xD;
the interval, by mornin'."&#xD;
" You don't think the crick '11 break up, do ye ? "&#xD;
"No; 't an't thawed enough for that, - though the snow has&#xD;
gone off like smoke the last four-'n'-twenty hours!"  Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood tossed about sleeplessly for an hour or two longer.  "I&#xD;
guess I'll git up," said he, at length, "and see how the weather&#xD;
looks. It don't rain so hard as it did, and seems to me the wind&#xD;
sounds colder."  He put on his clothes, and went out. "There's&#xD;
more rain fell than I thought for," he said, returning presently.&#xD;
"I do'no' 'bout the crick.  I guess I better go down an' git&#xD;
Cha'lotte up to the barn, to ventur'. -If 't had n't been for that&#xD;
plaguy kidnabber ! I would n't begrudge a night's lodgin' to the&#xD;
wust enemy I got, but I could a' turned him ou' doors into the&#xD;
storm with a good stomach, if there 'd ben any way of gittin' red&#xD;
of him. I 'll take the hoss an' an umbrel, an' I guess we '11 git&#xD;
along."&#xD;
"What was that?" said Mrs. Jackwood. "I thought I heard&#xD;
something on the stairs."&#xD;
Mr. Jadkwood went to examine, and met Dickson coming softly&#xD;
from the chamber.&#xD;
"You 're up late," said the latter, with a sinister smile.&#xD;
"I should ruther say 't was airly," retorted the farmer. " D'ye&#xD;
want anything p'tic'lar ?"&#xD;
" I come down to see if I could git a drink o' water."&#xD;
c" Wal, sir, that ye can have. The pump 's in here; 't '11 want&#xD;
primin'. If you'll wait a minute, I'll bring ye a glass."&#xD;
" It 's a rainy night," observed Dickson.&#xD;
"Terrible," said Mr. Jackwood, plying the wheezy pump.&#xD;
"21 hope that gal an't out nowheres ! " returned the other.&#xD;
"I hope not," said the farmer.&#xD;
" Look a' here !" exclaimed  Dickson, in an under-tone ;&#xD;
"I 'm bent on findin' that gal ; and 't an't no use her tryin' to&#xD;
git away.  Now, I tell ye what: it's my opinion you know&#xD;
where she is."&#xD;
" I wish I did !"&#xD;

"I've thought so, all along; and I'm as good as sure now.&#xD;
You an't up at four in the mornin' for nothin'. Now, be reason'-&#xD;
ble, and own up. It 'll be better for the gal, for the job will be&#xD;
over with sooner; and it 's got to come, first or last. It'll be&#xD;
better for you, too, in more senses than one. ' I s'pose you know&#xD;
the consequences o' harborin' or concealin' a fugitive, and resistin'&#xD;
the execush'n o' the law?  Now, look a' here !"  Dickson took a&#xD;
heavy purse from  his-pocket, and counted out some pieces of&#xD;
money. " There's fifty dollars for ye, if you 'd like to earn it."&#xD;
"'Arn it? how?"&#xD;
"By simply sayin' three words that '11 set me on the right&#xD;
track. Ye don't find fifty dollars in the dirt every day."&#xD;
" I should like to find fifty dollars well enough," replied the&#xD;
farmer; "but I do'no' 'bout pickin' it.out o' jest that kind o'&#xD;
dirt - even s'posin' I could."&#xD;
Dickson felt encouraged.  "I '11 make it-  le' me see -sixty,&#xD;
seventy, seventy-five. Now, there 's a chance ! Come," -look-&#xD;
ing at his watch,-"''t won't pay to go to bed agin to-night, I&#xD;
reck'n; so, le's set down and talk it over.",&#xD;
"You'll have to wait for me a little while," said the farmer,&#xD;
taking down the lantern.&#xD;
"Yougoin' out in the rain ? "&#xD;
"Yes; I got to look to my hosses."&#xD;
" If that 's all," cried Dickson, "I 'll go along with ye, and&#xD;
we '11 be talking. "&#xD;
The farmer, exasperated, felt an impulse to smash the lantern&#xD;
in the villain's face. Dickson smiled: in that smile there was&#xD;
low cunning and surly determination, which showed that it was&#xD;
useless to attempt, either by stratagem or force, to shake him off.&#xD;
As they stood there, a fresh volley of wind and rain, lashing&#xD;
the kitchen window, filled Mr. Jackwood with fresh anxiety for&#xD;
Charlotte's safety. He hurried forth, pulling the door after him;&#xD;
but Dickson wrenched it open with a powerful hand, and stalked&#xD;
to his side.&#xD;
" None o' that!" he growled, taking the farmer's arm. " We&#xD;
may as well keep together, I reck'n. I don't mind the rain."&#xD;

XXXV.&#xD;
HECTOR'S JOURNEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was a close, wet evening. Rolling vapors filled the sky. A&#xD;
crowd was gathered by the river, and a line of slaves, ranged&#xD;
along the wharf, held pitch-pine torches above their heads, to light&#xD;
a steamer coming up from the bay. Gradually the vessel ap-&#xD;
proached, her slow wheels beating the water ; cries passed from&#xD;
deck to wharf; the lines were flung out, and made fast to the&#xD;
shore ; then came the rush and bustle of landing - friends greet-&#xD;
ing friends, porters' shouldering luggage, carriages and wagons in&#xD;
attendance, and the flare of the torches wavering over all.&#xD;
There was one passenger, among the first to land, who made&#xD;
haste to engage a hack, and rode away from this animated and&#xD;
picturesque scene. As the vehicle rattled through the town, he&#xD;
gazed listlessly, upon the lighted shops, the gay saloons, and the&#xD;
glistening, muddy. walks. Each spot was familiar to his eye ; but&#xD;
how far-off, and cold, and idle, seemed all that life to.the world of&#xD;
thought and feeling in his own breast!&#xD;
Suddenly the carriage stopped. "What is the trouble?"-and&#xD;
he put his head out of the window.&#xD;
"The Strikers !" said the coachman. Other vehicles had&#xD;
stopped. At the doors and windows of houses, on the steps, on&#xD;
the walks, appeared throngs of spectators, presenting a variety of&#xD;
complexions, rather remarkable to an eye unaccustomed to mixed&#xD;
races The music of a band approaching floated upon the air;&#xD;
and Hector, looking in the direction towards which the many-hued&#xD;
faces were turned, beheld a grotesque procession. Then he re-&#xD;
membered that it was New Year's Eve, the season of masquerades;&#xD;
and that the STRIKERS were one of the famous societies, which, by&#xD;

296                HECTOR'S JOURNEY.&#xD;
their fantastic displays upon that anniversary, make Mobile the&#xD;
rival of Rome and Venice in their gay carnivals.&#xD;
A double chain of torch-bearers, with dusky faces and bare&#xD;
arms, like those upon the wharf, marked the line of the proces-&#xD;
sion. In front burned the cabalistic characters of the order -&#xD;
"c  o &amp;amp;o0"-upon an ornate and showy standard. Then (won-&#xD;
derful to behold!) came marching out of the fabulous past, out of&#xD;
the realms of fiction, out of the covers of books, the heroes of&#xD;
Romance:.Amadis of Gaul, the Cid, and Arthur,-with knights of the&#xD;
round table, in gorgeous panoply; Pantagruel, Rabelais' creation,&#xD;
of vast and laughable dimensions; and Don Quixote, grim with&#xD;
courage, mounted on the boniest of steeds, and accompanied by his&#xD;
doughty squire, striding a grave animal of a long-eared race.&#xD;
Ivanhoe, Robin Hood, and the fantastic Wamba, came after.&#xD;
Then might have been witnessed the edifying spectacle of Tom&#xD;
Jones and Gil Blas, walking arm in arm; Mr. Pickwick and Oli-&#xD;
ver Twist; Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, the 'three guardsmen,&#xD;
world-renowned; and the- Count of Monte Christo in conversation&#xD;
with the Wandering Jew. Leatherstocking, and some of Coop-&#xD;
er's Indians, appeared conspicuous; and Robinson Crusoe and&#xD;
his man Friday marched in the midst.of the procession. Many&#xD;
of those that followed were unknown to Hector ; but there was&#xD;
no mistaking Hudibras and Orlando Furioso, who brought up the&#xD;
rear. Uncle Tom, by a singular oversight, was not represented,&#xD;
except accidentally, perhaps, in the figures of the torch-bearers.&#xD;
The procession tramped on through the thin and slippery mud,&#xD;
the glare of the torches growing sombre and misty in the distance;&#xD;
and Hector, who had dismounted from the coach, was about re-&#xD;
suming his seat, when a hand touched his shoulder.&#xD;
"I had to put on my glasses to make sure 't was you!" cried a&#xD;
cordial old gentleman, grasping his hand. " Where did you come&#xD;
from.?  Where are you going?"&#xD;
"I landed ten minutes ago from the steamer, and I am on my&#xD;
way to the Battle House."&#xD;
"The Battle House?  I suppose you know the Strikers give a&#xD;
grand entertainment there to-night ! You shall see the last of the&#xD;
Mohicans dance in his war-paint and feat~hers,.and make havoc&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR'S JOURNEY.                   297&#xD;
with the hearts of the ladies.  Don Quixote and Sam Weller&#xD;
may be expected to vie with, each other in gallantry, and Rip&#xD;
Van Winkle shall show himself wide awake after his twenty years'&#xD;
nap. Meanwhile, why won't you jump into my carriage, and ride&#xD;
with us to Royal-street ?" cried the old gentleman. " You must&#xD;
see the Cowbellions. And, I'll tell you what, your baggage shall&#xD;
be sent to my house, and you shall make us a visit."&#xD;
He would listen to no objections; and Hector, who had in fact&#xD;
no very grave objections to advance, accepted the invitation. The&#xD;
old gentleman's carriage was close by.. It contained two ladies,-&#xD;
one a fine-looking, middle-aged person, arrayed with considerable&#xD;
magnificence; the other younger, of a more delicate beauty, and&#xD;
a more thoughtful and spiritual countenance.&#xD;
" My sister, Mrs. De Rohan," said the old gentleman, indicat-&#xD;
ing the elder of the two, " and my niece. Ladies, Mr. Dun-&#xD;
bury."&#xD;
, "I expected to see Helen," said Hector.&#xD;
"She is preparing for a ball. After witnessing the show, we&#xD;
will try to get home in time to see her off. Drive on, Parch-&#xD;
ment !"-to the colored coachman. " Royal-street."&#xD;
"Yes, massa," said Parchment, proudly drawing up the reins.&#xD;
Royal-street was found impassable ; and Parchment, consulting&#xD;
his master, brought the span to a- halt upon an eligible corner.&#xD;
Another procession was approaching; and the crowds were dense.&#xD;
First came the band, in dashing uniforms; then followed, amid a&#xD;
throng of servitors, the colossal effigy of a milk-white cow, with&#xD;
extraordinary horns, a wondrous length of tail, and luminous eyes,&#xD;
all hung with festoons of ribbons, and with silver bells.&#xD;
"These are the Cowbeilions, I suppose, Mr. Copliff ?" said&#xD;
Hector.&#xD;
" Yes, that is the venerable name, of the society," replied the&#xD;
old gentleman.&#xD;
"'What a whimsical caprice ! " exclaimed the elder of the two&#xD;
ladies.&#xD;
 " A caprice, Mrs. Dc  Rohan," said her brother, "which has&#xD;
grown in power and -popularity for some twenty years. I was&#xD;
once a Cowbellion myself," he added, with self-complacency.&#xD;

" You! " cried-Mrs. De Rohan. "Dear me! what is the mean-&#xD;
ing of those outlandish costumes?"&#xD;
"I should think the entire mineral kingdom had marched out&#xD;
of the bowels of the earth, to parade in Royal-street !" said Hec-&#xD;
tor.  "Observe, upon that coal-black steed, that coal-black rider,&#xD;
with a block of sea-coal for a head."&#xD;
" Old King Cole himself!" ejaculated Mr. Copliff.&#xD;
" Precious.Stones sparkles superbly in contrast," said Hector.&#xD;
" To his knees he is all garnets ; his breast is of onyx, his arms&#xD;
of ruby, his thighs sapphire, and his head of pure diamonds !&#xD;
How ludicrous Chalk looks, coming after ! \He is as white as ten&#xD;
millers. There is Iron, and Silver, and Gold ; and, look ! there&#xD;
comes the vegetable kingdom, - animated melons, colossal cauli-&#xD;
flowers, and beets on horse-back ! "&#xD;
"A repetition, a plagiarism !" cried Mr. Copliff.  We had&#xD;
the vegetable kingdom thirteen years ago, when I was a Cowbell-&#xD;
ion. I was a cabbage-head. You never saw anything so green.&#xD;
My leaves covered me to my waist ; I think a hungry ox might&#xD;
have eaten me, without discovering the difference. I was con-&#xD;
structed of pasteboard and green silk. Observe Sir Carrot !"&#xD;
"Where.?" asked Mrs. De Rohan, raising her eye-glass.&#xD;
"Yonder, travelling in company with a friendly potato," said&#xD;
Hector.  " He is the magnified image of a little fellow I pulled,&#xD;
out of my father's garden last summer. His yellow limbs are the&#xD;
forked roots, and his head branches out naturally into a luxuriant&#xD;
adornment of tops. How do you like it, Parchment ?"&#xD;
Parchment, showing his magnificent teeth : " Aw  I-- massa&#xD;
- it 's mos' superfluous ! "- meaning superb. "-De Strikers is n't&#xD;
a suckumstance, dis year, my 'pinion ! "&#xD;
Mrs. De Rohan : " Is not there the aniinal kingdom,&#xD;
behind ?"&#xD;
Hector : " I hope not; for we have seen enough. But there it&#xD;
comes, truly ! It looks as if three menageries and the inhabit-&#xD;
ants of several cedar swamps had been picturesquely mixed, and-&#xD;
marched into Mobile."&#xD;
Parchment, shaking : "Look a' dat ar great big alligator, on&#xD;
his hind legs ! Dems what ye call jaws !"&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR'S JOURNEY.                  299&#xD;
Mr. Copliff: "Look out for the span, Parchment ; they may&#xD;
take fright. What 's the matter?"&#xD;
" I declar', massa," articulated the coachman, "I's laughed till&#xD;
I's powerful weak !"&#xD;
Hector had become suddenly thoughtful.- Dragons, serpents,&#xD;
monstrous frogs, men with lion's heads, n en with tusks and trunks,&#xD;
men with beaks and wings, and men with tails, moved by him un-&#xD;
observed, in the torches' smoky light.&#xD;
" Are you tired of it, Dunbury ?"&#xD;
"0 , no !"  Hector started. "But my mind was elsewhere.&#xD;
I did wrong to accept your invitation; I 'm not in a social mood&#xD;
to-night."&#xD;
" You will find a sympathizing companion in my niece," said&#xD;
the old gentleman. "I believe she has not spoken since you joined&#xD;
us. Ah ! there is Adam and Eve, the last of the animal creation,&#xD;
and the end of the show. Have we seen enough, ladies? Drive&#xD;
home, Parchment ! By the way, Lucy, tell Dunbury about -&#xD;
what was the name ?  Your favorite. He is from the north, and&#xD;
may give you some information and advice."&#xD;
" That is not probable. But," said the niece, after some hesi-&#xD;
tation, "it is easy to state the facts.  I had a favorite, as my&#xD;
uncle rightly calls her -"&#xD;
" I remember the name now ! " cried Mr. Copliff: "Camille."&#xD;
How the shock of that word smote Hector's heart !&#xD;
" She was by nature a rare character; and during the few&#xD;
years she lived with me," said Lucy, "she developed wonderfully.&#xD;
Although my servant, she was more like a younger sister ; and I&#xD;
treated her as such."&#xD;
Mr. Copliff : " There you were wrong," - dogmatically, -&#xD;
"totally wrong, Lucy.  But you-know my principles; and we&#xD;
will not argue that point. A person, born of a slave mother,&#xD;
should not, on any condition&#xD;
." You did not know Camille, uncle, or you would never repeat&#xD;
your celebrated axiom," said the other, with a smile.,&#xD;
Mr. Copliff, indulgently: "Well, well, my dear, go on."&#xD;
" Circumstances, which I need not explain," -the speaker's&#xD;
voice faltered, - "removed Camille from me at a critical and&#xD;

dangerous period. It was not in my power to intercede, and she&#xD;
was sold. Are you interested ? "&#xD;
" Much," spoke Hector, betwixt the beatings of his heart.&#xD;
" I think it was horrible!" exclaimed Mrs. De Rohan. "I&#xD;
have not come south to interfere with your blessed institutions,&#xD;
brother,"-- with sarcasm, -" but you must allow me now and&#xD;
then to express a meek opinion. I think the idea of a young girl,&#xD;
like Camille, being sold - "&#xD;
Mr. Copliff, wincing : " Go on, Lucy."&#xD;
"Until very recently, I was not free to make any efforts in her&#xD;
behalf," said his niece. "But Camille had been brought to this&#xD;
city, from New Orleans; and on my arrival here, three days ago,&#xD;
I went personally to search her out. I applied to the man who&#xD;
purchased her ; when, imagine my astonishment to learn that she&#xD;
had made her escape to freedom !"&#xD;
Hector could scarce refrain from clasping the speaker's hand, in&#xD;
the sympathy and exultation of his spirit.&#xD;
"This interests you, I see. But hear the rest.  I thought it&#xD;
natural that the man would dispose of his claim upon the poor&#xD;
girl for a mere trifle ; and I resolved that, if within the limit of&#xD;
my means, I would secure it ; for I had hopes that she would&#xD;
communicate with me at no distant day, and then I could have&#xD;
the gratification of giving her her liberty, and insuring her safety&#xD;
should she choose to return to me."&#xD;
"And you bought the claim ? " breathed Hector.&#xD;
" I did not ; I will tell you why. ' Had you proposed the thing&#xD;
a month ago,' said the man, 'you should have had her for a song.&#xD;
Now it is different.' ' How different ?' I asked. 'Because.then&#xD;
I had no hopes of ever hearing from her again.' 'But now -'&#xD;
'Now I have hopes,' said he, with a confidence that stunned me.."&#xD;
" Here we are at home !_" cried Mr. Copliff. "Wait and finish&#xD;
your story, Lucy, after we get in. We will indulge in a little&#xD;
refreshment ; then, if you like, Dunbury, we will ride around to&#xD;
the Battle House, and call on the Strikers. Keep the carriage&#xD;
up, Parchment." '&#xD;
Hector could not speak. Mechanically he helped the ladies&#xD;
down, and accompanied them into the house. .&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR'S JOURNEY.                   801&#xD;
" I have but a word to add," said the younger of the two.&#xD;
" There was a stubbornness and independence in the man, upon&#xD;
which I could make no impression. He declared that, as matters.&#xD;
stood, he would sooner risk an entire loss, including the expense&#xD;
he had incurred in the hope of recovering Camille, than sell his&#xD;
claim for less than eight hundred dollars."&#xD;
" That is exorbitant !" exclaimed Mr. Copliff. " I would never&#xD;
give that."&#xD;
" But if she is brought back, it would require a much larger&#xD;
sum to purchase her. Consider, she is a beautiful--"&#xD;
"But fugitives are not brought back so easy, rmy dear woman;&#xD;
so don't be alarmed. Ah ! there comes Helen, for our criticisms&#xD;
on her ball-dress ! "&#xD;
A beautiful' girl, of rather petite figure, but voluptuously formed,&#xD;
made her appearance in a superb white attire, with jewels glitter-&#xD;
ing on her arms and in her hair.&#xD;
"Well, done !" cried her' father.  " There, Dunbury," -turn-&#xD;
ing with a smile of pride to Hector, -" what do you think of&#xD;
that?"&#xD;
Helen started back, with a blush, at sight of her father's guest ;&#xD;
but, recovering herself presently, she advanced, self-possessed, with&#xD;
a smile of welcome, to lay her delicate white-gloved hand in Hec-&#xD;
tor's. He took it coldly, and with a few formal and commonplace&#xD;
words, uttered with effort, bowed stiffly, like an automaton.&#xD;
" Is that New England gallantry ? " cried Mr. Copliff, in a&#xD;
rallying tone. "Come to me, darling ; I will teach our cool&#xD;
friend southern etiquette." He bent down and kissed her ten-&#xD;
derly upon both cheeks. "There, go, my pet ! You have a great&#xD;
deal of snow and ice in Vermont, have you not?" turning again&#xD;
to Hector.&#xD;
" In their season," said the young man, without a smile. "We&#xD;
have fiery skies, too, in their turn. There is a time for everything&#xD;
under the sun."&#xD;
Mr. Copliff perceived the pale anxiety of his face, and changed&#xD;
his tone. "Well," pressing his hand heartily, "we will not&#xD;
quarrel about sectional differences. Let me show you to your&#xD;
quarters. You will find your baggage there before you."&#xD;

"Mr. Dunbury has something to say to me," interposed his&#xD;
niece, gently, "if my impressions do not deceive me."&#xD;
"They do not !" exclaimed Hector ; "I have something to say&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
Mr. Copliff looked from one to the other, in astonishment.&#xD;
"You are two incomprehensibles ! You have progressed, for a&#xD;
short acquaintance. Come, Mrs..De!"    And, giving his sister,&#xD;
his arm, he led her with lofty politeness from the room.&#xD;
Then Hector turned to Mrs. Graves.&#xD;
"You knew I wished to speak with you!" he said, eagerly.&#xD;
"I felt it ! " exclaimed Mrs. Graves.  " About Camille."&#xD;
"You are right. I know her. And, through her, I know&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
" I thought so. Tell me of her ! Where is she ?"&#xD;
"In my father's house.  I have come to make terms with -&#xD;
the man who calls himself her owner ! I supposed he would dis-&#xD;
pose of his claim for any trifle.  I hope I have not arrived too&#xD;
late ! If she has been discovered (that is what I fear), she must&#xD;
be saved; she must be bought."&#xD;
"0, truly she must ! I am not rich -"&#xD;
"Nor I! Bat what I-have I count but as straw in the balance&#xD;
with her happiness ! In my pocket-book is a draft for five hun-&#xD;
dred dollars. By some means,-I do not yet know what,-I&#xD;
must raise the remainder by to-morrow morning."&#xD;
"Depend upon me for that," cried Mrs. Graves. "I claim the&#xD;
privilege of doing at least so much - "&#xD;
"Generous heart!-- as if you had done nothing for her yet !&#xD;
0," said Hector, "you should hear her speak of you; it is always&#xD;
with such gratitude, such love ! For her sake, I accept your con-&#xD;
tribution. Some day I shall be able to repay it, with interest !&#xD;
Then I will thank you ! Pardon my abruptness. now, - excuse&#xD;
me to Helen.--"&#xD;
"You are going ?"&#xD;
" I shall try to send a telegraphic despatch this evening. When&#xD;
I return, you shall know all about Camille."&#xD;
Hector was intercepted in the hail by Mr. Copliff..&#xD;
" What now ?" cried the- old gentleman.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR'S JOURNEY.                  808&#xD;
" I was about to demonstrate the coolness of my Vermont tem-&#xD;
per, by taking an unceremonious leave. I shall return in half&#xD;
an hour. . I have thought of a little matter of business - a tele-&#xD;
graphic despatch -"&#xD;
" Is it so important ? Then let Parchment drive you to the&#xD;
office. Make haste to return, for supper will be waiting."&#xD;
" Thank you a thousand times ! " and Hector mounted the&#xD;
carriage, and rode away.'&#xD;
" What success?" asked Mrs. Graves, half an hour later,&#xD;
meeting him in the hall.&#xD;
" Dubious !  I cannot learn until to-morrow whether the&#xD;
despatch will go through to its destination."&#xD;
"We must be patient, and have faith till then !"&#xD;
" Faith ! " answered Hector. "0, to-morrow ! to-morrow ! "&#xD;
" Wish yer happy new year, massa !" said old Juno, the cook,&#xD;
looking up, and showing her good-natured face and broken teeth,&#xD;
as her master came muttering down the stairs.&#xD;
" I wish you a hundred thousand ! " growled Dr. Tanwood,&#xD;
tying his cravat, "and as many children ! "&#xD;
" Laws bless us ! what 'u'd a' ol' 'oman do with so many new-&#xD;
years as dat, say not'n' bout de chil'n ? "&#xD;
"Plague your masters with your everlasting clatter ! There 's&#xD;
no use trying to get any sleep in this house!"&#xD;
"Laws, Massa ! han't ye no idee what time o' day 't is? Clock&#xD;
struck ten 'mos' 'n hour ago. Been a gen'l'man waitin' for ye, dis&#xD;
half-hour !"&#xD;
Buttoning his waistcoat, and sweeping his fingers across his hair,&#xD;
Dr. Tanwood crossed the hall-floor, and entered his office.&#xD;
Hector was in waiting.&#xD;
" I hope I have not disturbed you --"&#xD;
"0, not at all! I've overslept myself a little this morning."&#xD;
The doctor looked in the glass which hung opposite the door, and&#xD;
brushed his hair over his forehead. "What can I do for you,&#xD;
sir?"&#xD;
Hector was pale ; his heart beat strong and fast. " I come to&#xD;
you from Mrs. Graves." The doctor fixed his searching glance&#xD;

on Hector. "Touching the affair she spoke with you about, the&#xD;
other day.-."&#xD;
"II remember,"-and the doctor nodded, with a peculiar smile.&#xD;
"She is desirous to know if any circumstances have occurred&#xD;
to alter your decision."&#xD;
" And if there have ? "&#xD;
" In  that case, I am authorized to treat with you."&#xD;
The doctor sat silent for near a minute, his dark eyes studying&#xD;
Hector, from beneath their gathered brows.&#xD;
" Yes," hp exclaimed, "circumstances have occurred to alter&#xD;
my decision."&#xD;
"Well?"&#xD;
"For eight hundred dollars, I think it was, I engaged to make&#xD;
over to Mrs. Graves my claim upon the girl Camille."&#xD;
" The sum she named," assented-Hector.&#xD;
"She' thought it too much."  The doctor leaned over, and&#xD;
tapped the table significantly. " But, as matters now stand, it is&#xD;
not enough. Prospects have risen ; and my terms have gone up&#xD;
in proportion."&#xD;
" Sir," said Hector, "I do not understand. Your terms -"&#xD;
" A thousand dollars, cash in hand," said the doctor; and, with&#xD;
an indifferent air, he smoothed down the look of ha4  that lay&#xD;
low upon his forehead.&#xD;
"You must, then, be extremely confident -"&#xD;
" Confident ?" 'The doctor laughed.  " Sir, I '11 wager the&#xD;
price of her, that in a week, at the furthest, she '11 be seen in&#xD;
Mobile ! Then no money will buy her."&#xD;
A dizzy blur darkened IHector's vision. He leaned~ his head&#xD;
upon his hand.   He saw the danger that threatened Charlotte&#xD;
clothed in all its terrors ; and money seemed but as water to be&#xD;
poured out for the security of her peace. Unfortunately, he had&#xD;
but little more than eight hundred dollars at his command, and to&#xD;
make a final offer of that was all that he could do.&#xD;
-" Not qu-i-t-e enough !" said the doctor.&#xD;
" Then," said Hector, " I must confer with Mrs. Graves."&#xD;
" Very good sir-! " And, with a sinister smile, the doctor&#xD;
arose to bow his visitor to the door.&#xD;
&#xD;
HECT R'S JOURNEY.                  805&#xD;
Tortured with doubts, Hector hurried from the office. He&#xD;
hastened to find an old friend, his former employer, of whom he&#xD;
hoped for aid : he was absent from the city. Though stunned&#xD;
momentarily by the news, he lost no time in idle regret, but,&#xD;
mounting a coach, rode to the house of an eminent physician,&#xD;
whom he knew. He was engaged at a consultation, and none&#xD;
could tell when he would be home. Again in the coach, Hector&#xD;
held his impatient spirit, until the slow vehicle brought him to&#xD;
the door of a benevolent citizen, of whom he had formerly&#xD;
received so many kindnesses that he had reason to hope for&#xD;
more. The bell was muffled, and a colored servant opened the&#xD;
door noiselessly. The master was dangerously ill, and could see&#xD;
no one.&#xD;
Foiled again in his purpose, Hector thought of Mr. Fob-&#xD;
bles, a merchant, to whom he had once rendered-an important&#xD;
service, and who had. ever since been loud in his protesta-&#xD;
tions of friendship. In less than a quarter of an hour, the two&#xD;
were standing face to face. Mr. Fobbles was delighted, and&#xD;
invited the visitor to walk home with him to dinner.Z Uncer-&#xD;
emoniously, Hector named the object of his visit. Mr. Fobbles&#xD;
would have been rejoiced to accommodate him; " but, indeed, sir,&#xD;
and indeed, sir ! nothing could have happened so awkwardly ! "&#xD;
At any other time he could have taken so small a sum out of his&#xD;
pocket, and given him; "but losses, sir, payments, perplexities -"&#xD;
Hector broke impetuously away. Mr. Copliff was now his&#xD;
last hope. He had dreaded to call on him for money, being his&#xD;
guest. But his fears for Charlotte overcame every other consid-&#xD;
eration. He reached the office. Mr' Copliff had just gone.&#xD;
" Where ?"&#xD;
"'To New Orleans, on business ; he will be back this evening."&#xD;
Ten minutes later, Hector came upon his old friend, Joseph&#xD;
Spalding, like an apparition.&#xD;
"Merciful heavens ! ".exclaimed the young lawyer, "are you&#xD;
substance or shadow ? "&#xD;
"Substance," uttered Hector, "since I seek substantial aid.&#xD;
Give me two hundred dollars !"&#xD;
" That sounds like flesh and blood," said Joseph; " but, tell&#xD;

me, did you ever know the time when I had two hundred dol..&#xD;
lars ?"&#xD;
"Spendthrift! - no ! " cried hector. "But you should have&#xD;
it ! My more than life depends upon it !"&#xD;
" Is it soserious ?"&#xD;
"Joseph, I have no time for words.  Can you get me the&#xD;
money ?"&#xD;
" True," said Joseph, " I ought to be able to raise so small a&#xD;
sum, and I will ; but I do not see how I can possibly have it for&#xD;
you before to-morrow."&#xD;
" To-morrow ! there 's an eternity betwixt now and then ! "&#xD;
Hector returned to Mrs. Graves., She grew pale at the sight&#xD;
of him. Words were needless to report his ill-success.&#xD;
" I have nothing at my immediate command," she said.&#xD;
"What I gave you thisimorning, I borrowed of my uncle. Until&#xD;
he returns -"&#xD;
"I have a better thought ! " cried Hector. "Can I see Mrs.&#xD;
De Rohan ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Graves left the room, and the other lady entered. She&#xD;
was a woman of the world ; no more like her spiritual companion&#xD;
than the moon is like' the stars; but benevolence beamed in her&#xD;
face, and beneath the gay externals of her life throbbed a warm&#xD;
and generous heart. Hector approached her confidently.&#xD;
"I have a confession to make to you, Mrs. De Rohan. I have&#xD;
not been quite true with you. I met you last night as a&#xD;
stranger."&#xD;
- " And was I not so ?"&#xD;
"Not altogether, madam. The mention of your name startled&#xD;
me ; then, when I heard it remarked that you were from Canada,&#xD;
I remembered you."&#xD;
"You had seen me, then.i ?"&#xD;
" I had heard of you. You must recollect a young girl who&#xD;
partly engaged herself as your travelling companion --."&#xD;
"Indeed! Miss Woods ! A charming person ! how much I&#xD;
have thought of her since ! And you know hertz "&#xD;
" Mrs. Graves knows her. It was of her she spoke last&#xD;
night -."&#xD;
&#xD;
HECTOR'S JOURNEY.                  807&#xD;
"Of her - Miss Woods! - Camille?"&#xD;
" They are the same ! "  And, without giving the other time to&#xD;
i'ecover from her astonishment, Hector poured forth the history.&#xD;
In his manner, his voice, his looks, there was an energy that&#xD;
swept everything before it. The other hesitated not an instant.&#xD;
She demanded neither reasons nor explanations. She left the room,&#xD;
and, returning straightway, placed in his' hand a purse of gold.&#xD;
"Take it! " she said, "and may it serve your purpose ! "&#xD;
Her features were suffused, her voice tremulous, her eyes filled&#xD;
with tears. In the name of Charlotte, of humanity, of Him&#xD;
whose mission was to loose the bonds of the oppressed, he uttered&#xD;
his thanks, and hurried from the house.&#xD;
Once more he confronted Dr. Tanwood. The doctor smiled,&#xD;
and, bowing with ironic civility, invited him to a seat.&#xD;
"Thank you," said Hector. "I have seen Mrs. Graves.&#xD;
And if you will please draw up the bill of sale -" The words&#xD;
sounded strange and awful in his ear. A bill of sale, as of some&#xD;
property : a horse, or an ox ; a bill of sale of a human soul ! Of&#xD;
Charlotte ! of his own wife !&#xD;
The doctor, smiling still: " If I will draw it up -"&#xD;
" I am prepared to comply with your terms."&#xD;
The doctor leaned over the table, and with gloating delib-&#xD;
eration fixed Hector with his hard, vindictive eye.&#xD;
"But if my terms should not be precisely the same as two&#xD;
hours ago ?"&#xD;
" Sir?"&#xD;
" I have had news ; and the presumptive value of my property&#xD;
is increased."&#xD;
" Is this, sir, - is this honorable dealing?"&#xD;
"Call it what you please ! If you deal with, me, you will take&#xD;
what terms you can get."&#xD;
" Will you, then,{be so good, sir," - Hector spoke calmly, but&#xD;
with a kindling fury in his look,--" as to name your ultimate&#xD;
terms, that I may know what to depend upon ? "&#xD;
",Certainly; if it will be any satisfaction. Splice on two hun-&#xD;
dred more, and you have it."&#xD;
" Twelve hundred ?" articulated Hector.&#xD;

HECTOR' S JOURNEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Precisely," smiled the doctor.&#xD;
" Will you have the kindness to put it in writing?"&#xD;
" Certainly, when you produce the cash, provided, live stock has&#xD;
not taken another sudden rise."&#xD;
At this brutal allusion, Hector felt a dangerous leaping of the&#xD;
blood. With fixed teeth, and lips compressed, he produced his&#xD;
pocket-book. Two checks, one of five hundred dollars, the other&#xD;
of three hundred, he laid upon the table. Then, resorting to&#xD;
Mrs. De Rohan's purse, he emptied out a heap of British gold.&#xD;
There was near double the amount he had asked for; and,&#xD;
making up the requisite sum in small bills, he shoved it towards&#xD;
the doctor.&#xD;
"Is that satisfactory ?"&#xD;
"No ! " burst forth the doctor, and he smote the table fiercely;&#xD;
' not for twelve hundred, nor twenty hundred, nor twenty times&#xD;
twenty hundred, will I quit my claim upon that girl !"&#xD;
A ghastly pallor chased the flush from Hector's cheek.&#xD;
" Can I know," - his voice was forced, but calm, --" can I&#xD;
know why I have been made the subject of this treatment ?"&#xD;
" By --- ! you can. I shall delight to show you ! Look ! "_&#xD;
he threw back the hair from his forehead, and revealed a rugged&#xD;
scar, -- " do you know that ? do you know me ? do you know&#xD;
this ?" And, snatching from a drawer a handkerchief stained and&#xD;
stiff with blood, he thrust it in Hector's face.&#xD;
Hector stood upon his feet, and with rigid features kept his&#xD;
firm look fixed upon the doctor's tiger-eyes.&#xD;
"Are you satisfied ? 'Do you understand me now ?"&#xD;
"' At least, I understand you ! " answered Hector. " We have&#xD;
met before. I know you now. Revenge may be just and noble.&#xD;
But, sir, let it fall on me. Do not make another - an innocent&#xD;
girl - its victim.&#xD;
"Your name is here,"-the doctor shook the handkerchief,&#xD;
" here, blotted by my blood ! and there," - striking a letter upon&#xD;
the table,-," I hear of you in connection with your innocent girl !&#xD;
I put the two together. And, sir, the owner of that name shall&#xD;
see her make a pleasant journey back to Mobile, and stop her if&#xD;

HECTOR'S JOURNEY.                  309&#xD;
he can. There '11 be sport, I reckon, before the job is over ; take&#xD;
my word for it ! And now, sir, allow me the pleasure of wishing&#xD;
you a good-day."&#xD;
" I have a word," said Hector. "I shall not argue; I shall&#xD;
leave the business in other hands. But there is something strug-&#xD;
gling here," -his hand was upon his breast,-"and it must&#xD;
forth ! I met you once; you attacked me. I shivered a tumbler&#xD;

something more. Be warned ! Press not too far ! Justice sets&#xD;
bounds to vengeance. You will but beat your head against the&#xD;

the day that sees Camille again in Your power will be the black-&#xD;

Hector went forth from the house. In the street he met a&#xD;
friend. It was Joseph. Hector stared, without appearing to rec-&#xD;
ognize him.&#xD;
"Good heavens!" exclaimed Joseph, "how haggard you look!&#xD;
What has happened? See, I have borrowed the money; I was on&#xD;
my way to find you."&#xD;
" You are kind, Joseph, but there is a trouble which money will&#xD;
not heal!"&#xD;
"Who knows? Come to my office. There 's no telling what&#xD;
money can do. Give me your case, and trust to me for the&#xD;
result."&#xD;
"Ah, Joseph, had I charged you with it in time ! But it was&#xD;
too sacred. And now it is too late ! And while I am here, wast-&#xD;
ing time and strength, there are those at home dying of despair in&#xD;
my absence!!"&#xD;

XXXv'.&#xD;
THE INUNDATION.&#xD;
iT was about an hour after Mr. Jackwood's departure from the&#xD;
stack, that Charlotte had observed a change in the storm. The&#xD;
wind went down, and the rain, which had all the evening kept up&#xD;
an incessant pelting and dripping, began to pour in torrents.&#xD;
Every other sound was lost in its wild rush and roar. It fell&#xD;
in this way for hours; until her spirit, lulled by the solemn&#xD;
monotony, forgot its pains, and sank into the oblivion of sleep.&#xD;
She was aroused by startling sounds in the night. She crept&#xD;
to the opening of her retreat, and'looked out. The intense dark-&#xD;
ness had given place to a faint grayish glimmer in the sky; but it&#xD;
was raining still, although less violently than before. The sounds&#xD;
were repeated.&#xD;
"Ho, ho ! ho, ho !"  Two strange, prolonged, inhuman cries !&#xD;
Then Charlotte heard footsteps plashing in the water which cov-&#xD;
ered the meadow, and caught a momentary glimpse of a dim,&#xD;
ghost-like figure moving by the stack. It passed from sight; and&#xD;
the plashing of footsteps became lost in the spattering and bub-&#xD;
bling of the rain. Then again, at a distance, after a long pause,&#xD;
the shouts arose, and died away in a long, plaintive, desolate wail.&#xD;
"Ho, ho ! Ho, ho-o---- o o!"&#xD;
Faint-eclhoes came from the sullen hills; and the rainy silence&#xD;
followed. Charlotte felt an unaccountable impulse to leave her&#xD;
retreat, -tud go wandering up and down in the, night and storm,&#xD;
uttering her soul in cries, like the mysterious being that had&#xD;
passed. Her sufferings of body and mind had sent the flame of&#xD;
fever into her blood, and in her sleep a light delirium had sur-&#xD;
prised her brain.&#xD;

THE INUNDATION.                   811&#xD;
"Ho, ho ! Ho, ho - o - o - o ! " sounded the cries again,&#xD;
fainter, and further off, in the night.&#xD;
She climbed over the wet hay at the mouth of the close and&#xD;
heated cell, and reached forth her hand towards the ground. It&#xD;
was plunged to, the wrist in an icy pool. The cold storm beat&#xD;
upon her face and neck. Chilled by. the shock, she withdrew&#xD;
beneath the shelter, and tried once more to sleep. But the&#xD;
air was stifling; her flesh burned with the fever; her temples&#xD;
ached with dull, heavy pains. In the anguish and despair of her&#xD;
state, she threw herself once more upon the wet hay, moaning,&#xD;
with face and arms and breast exposed to the rain. The bath&#xD;
revived her. Again raising herself upon her arm, she perceived&#xD;
that her hair was dripping wet. It had been drenched in the&#xD;
pool. She put out her hand again, and discovered, to her con-&#xD;
sternation, that the water was rising round the stack, and creep-&#xD;
ing, creeping, slowly and steadily, into her retreat.&#xD;
Her consciousness was now fully restored. She held her breath,&#xD;
listening intently, and gazing out into the darkness. The gale&#xD;
had risen again; the storm lashed the stack; and all around, the&#xD;
rain gurgled and murmured. For some time she had been half&#xD;
conscious of hearing a faint roar in the distance. -It approached,&#xD;
and grew distinct; and now her mind was alert to comprehend the&#xD;
mysterious noise. It seemed at first like a mighty wind, pouring&#xD;
through forests of reeling and crashing trees. Sharp and clear&#xD;
reports, like thunder-claps, were mingled with the roar. But the&#xD;
noise came from up the valley, where there were no woods; and&#xD;
the peals cracked and echoed along the ground.&#xD;
Then it seemed as though an earthquake were driving its plough,&#xD;
with whirlwind and thunder, through the valley. Nearer and&#xD;
nearer came the din. Charlotte stood out in the storm, and,&#xD;
clinging to the fence, she beheld a glimmer and a flash, as of roll-&#xD;
ing snow and foam, It came down the valley, in the track of the&#xD;
riving thunder. And now the sounds resolved themselves into the&#xD;
splitting and crashing of ice, and the impetuous rush of waters.&#xD;
The creek was breaking up, and a flood was inundating the valley !&#xD;
The convulsion passed; the din and detonation echoed down the&#xD;
.stream; but already the stack was surrounded by billows. They&#xD;

&#xD;
THE INUNDATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
dashed through the fence, and leaped up, drenching Charlotte's&#xD;
feet, as she endeavored to climb beyond their reach. The flood&#xD;
rose rapidly ; the fence was low; and, in the extremity of fear,&#xD;
Charlotte got upon the shed. The sheep were beneath, bleating&#xD;
piteously, and swimming around the stack. The steers had run&#xD;
out frantically, at the approach of the inundation; and now, as the&#xD;
ingulfing waves overtook them, their bellowings of brute terror&#xD;
sounded dismally above the roar.&#xD;
All this had -passed in a brief space of time; and now Char-&#xD;
lotte found herself alone upon a frail and insecure structure, in&#xD;
the midst of a wilderness of waters. Masses and fragments of ice&#xD;
and snow went drifting by in the night. Some of these struck the&#xD;
posts that supported the shed, and made it tremble and creak be-&#xD;
neath her weight. The fence, meanwhile, went to pieces, the rails&#xD;
floating off, one by one, in the current.&#xD;
And now all the stories Charlotte had heard of freshets in the&#xD;
valley, that came sweeping away bridges, and flocks, and herds,&#xD;
recurred to her imagination with exaggerated terrors. She re-&#xD;
membered that Mr. Jackwood had related many of these, always&#xD;
boasting that, thanks to his superior forethought, he had never yet&#xD;
lost 'either horse, or horned-beast, or sheep. Why had he, who&#xD;
was so versed in signs and changes of the weather, forgotten him-&#xD;
self upon that night, of all nights, and left her there to perish?&#xD;
Up to this hour she had been dumb; but now the fear and delir-&#xD;
ium of her soul found expression in a long, piercing cry.&#xD;
A burst of wild laughter answered from the stream. She gazed&#xD;
in the direction of the shout, and perceived a dark shape drifting&#xD;
by upon a cake of ice. With a shudder of horror she remem-&#xD;
bered the cries she had previously heard, and leaned forward&#xD;
eagerly to watch the floating mass.&#xD;
"Hurra! hurra ! " shouted the mysterious being, as if he had&#xD;
been the demon of the flood.&#xD;
"Edward !" shrieked Charlotte.-&#xD;
The shape rose up to the stature of a man, dimly discerned in&#xD;
the darkness, and began to leap, with grotesque gestures, upon&#xD;
the ice.   -&#xD;
"Edward! Edward!" implored Charlotte.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE INUNDATION.                   318&#xD;
He reached forth his arms; a cry of recognition, of joy, came&#xD;
from the flood. But suddenly there was a dull explosion, the ice&#xD;
went asunder, and the shape disappeared amid the agitated frag-&#xD;
ments. Two or three strangled cries, a little bubbling and splash-&#xD;
ing; then the waters swept on, and the ice drifted away in the&#xD;
darkness.&#xD;
Aroused by the sounds in the valley, Mr. Jackwood rushed out,&#xD;
Dickson still keeping doggedly by his side. Abimelech followed,&#xD;
buttoning his jacket by the way.&#xD;
"Give us a helpin' hand!" shouted the farmer, throwing open&#xD;
the barn-doors. He seized the boat, that was housed there for the&#xD;
winter, and dragged it from ts place. "To the crick ! "&#xD;
" If it 's for that gal," cried Dickson, "say the word, and' I'm&#xD;
yer man!&#xD;
"Stand away !" said the farmer, through his teeth; and alone,&#xD;
by main force, he dragged the boat to the bank. "Bring a pail&#xD;
or suthin, Bim'lech ! Where 's the oars?" The oars were found;&#xD;
Abimelech came running with a dipper to bail with; Mrs. Jack-&#xD;
wood brought the lantern; and the boat was launched in the&#xD;
sweeping current. "Git in, Bim'lech!"&#xD;
"The ol' thing '11 leak like a siv ! " said the boy, as he scram-&#xD;
bled aboard.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood was about to follow, when Dickson stepped in&#xD;
before him.&#xD;
"Git out o' there !" exclaimed the farmer, fiercely.&#xD;
Dickson possessed himself of the oars. "I reck'n 't '11 be as&#xD;
well for me to keep you company; I feel an interest in that gal."&#xD;
" You've done enough for her, and for us, too! Will ye git&#xD;
out ? We 're goin' to pick up the drowndin' sheep, an' there won't&#xD;
be room!"&#xD;
"I '11 help as much as I '11 hender, I reck'n ! " retorted Dick-&#xD;
son,-- and the lantern .shining upon his face showed it dark and&#xD;
determined. " Come on. I 'm a powerful hand at the oars."&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood glanced around. Had his eye fallen upon any&#xD;
sort of weapon, the impulse that prompted him to knock the vil-&#xD;
lain into the water would have led to a struggle. He hesitated&#xD;

$14                 THE INUNDATION.&#xD;
but a moment, however. Delay might prove fatal to Charlotte.&#xD;
And the swift thought flashed through his brain, that, in case of&#xD;
her rescue, it would still be time to deliver her, by desperate&#xD;
means, from the hands of the kidnapper.&#xD;
"t Gi'me the lantern ! " and, taking it from the hands of his&#xD;
anxious wife, he stepped aboard, and shoved clear of the bank.&#xD;
" That 's the wisest thing you could do," growled Dickson.&#xD;
"It'll be jest my cussed luck, if that gal 's drownded ! I'm cer-&#xD;
tain I heard yells off in this direction. . But I'11 have the wuth of&#xD;
her out o' somebody, -you may make sure o' that ! "&#xD;
" She might git on the cattle-shed," said the frightened Bim.&#xD;
" Look a' here, boy ! was she hid anywheres about that stack?&#xD;
I've had that in my mind ever since I quit it; and I 'm mad,&#xD;
now, that it did n't burn up'! "&#xD;
"Give me an oar !" said Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
" You 'tend to your steerin'! " answered Dickson. He plied&#xD;
the oars vigorously with his powerful arms. Mr. Jackwood sat&#xD;
in the stern, and steered out upon the dark and whirling flood.&#xD;
Abimelech, in the bow, held the light. At first the current car-&#xD;
ried the boat rapidly down stream; but, having crossed the chan-&#xD;
nel of the creek, they came upon the comparatively still sheet of&#xD;
water that overspread the meadows.&#xD;
"Bim'lech," said Mr. Jackwood, "hold up the lantern as high&#xD;
as you can reach ! "&#xD;
The boy placed it on his 'head, and stood up in'the bow; the&#xD;
light shining round upon the gloomy waves.&#xD;
" Sit down ! you 'll fall!" cried his father.&#xD;
"No, I won't!" said Bim, grasping the lantern with both&#xD;
hands. "O-o-o-o! see that big junk o'ice!"&#xD;
" How fur be we from the stack?" asked Dickson.&#xD;
" Hold your oars a minute !" cried the farmer. "I don'no&#xD;
'xac'ly where we be."&#xD;
"There 's the old elm !" cried Abimelech. " An' there's the&#xD;
knoll beyond !"-&#xD;
" Are you sure on 't "-.. Mr. Jackwood. strained his eyes in&#xD;
the darkness.-" I guess you 're right. Go ahead."&#xD;
Dickson had taken -advantage of the pause, to sound the water&#xD;
&#xD;
THE INUNDATION.                    815&#xD;
with his oar.  "'T an't over two foot deep!" he declared, in&#xD;
astonishment.&#xD;
"It 's high ground here," said the farmer. " It 's lower where.&#xD;
the stack stands."&#xD;
"Your valley, tucked in here 'twixt the mountains," observed&#xD;
Dickson, pulling again at the oars, "is like the bottom cf an&#xD;
almighty big tunn'l, with the crick for the spout. Any man&#xD;
that 's used to the country should 'ave knowed better than to leave&#xD;
even a dumb beast down here is sech a storm."&#xD;
Already Mr. Jackwood was suffering unspeakable trouble of&#xD;
mind on Charlotte's account; and a reproach from such a source&#xD;
filled his hot heart to choking fulness.&#xD;
"Who'd a' knowed," cried Bim, "'t was 'goin' to rain so like&#xD;
gre't guns ? See, father ! it 's turnin' round cold, jest as you said&#xD;
't would!, The rain 's more 'n half snow, now!"&#xD;
" Be still, Bim'lech !" said the farmer, in a hoarse voice.&#xD;
" Hello ! " ejaculated the boy, "there 's the fence. There 's&#xD;
only jest the top-board and the ends o' the posts out o' the water.&#xD;
O-o-o-o ! a little more, an' you'd smashed right into it ! "&#xD;
To pass the fence, it was necessary to drop down once more&#xD;
towards the channel of the creek. They had not proceeded far&#xD;
when they found the boards torn away, and the posts broken&#xD;
down. It was at the spot where the crushing mass of ice, arrived&#xD;
at a bend in the stream, had overswept the banks, and rushed&#xD;
down towards the stack. As they passed the fence, Dickson&#xD;
rested on his oars, and shouted. No reply.&#xD;
"I thought I heard a sheep bl'at," said Bim. " Father ! look&#xD;
out for them bushes!"&#xD;
"Pull away !" cried the farmer.&#xD;
" I heard somethin'," Dickson declared. " The stack can't be&#xD;
fur off, now."&#xD;
"There!" exclaimed Abimelech; "that was a sheep !    It&#xD;
bl'ated aging! I see the stack !"&#xD;
"Your eyes are better 'n mine," said Dickson, glancing over his&#xD;
shoulder. " I see somethin', though, out there in the dark."&#xD;
" Why don't she answer, I wonder? If she 's on the shed, I&#xD;
should think she'd see the light, and call us," said Bim.&#xD;
&#xD;

316                  THE INUNDATION.&#xD;
" Jest my luck ! " growled Dickson. "It makes me mad to lose&#xD;
a gal that way !"&#xD;
"Keep your light out o' my eyes !" cried Mr. Jackwood, as,&#xD;
gazing over the bow, he stared in the direction of the gloomy&#xD;
mass.&#xD;
" Had n't I better be bailing' a little?" asked Abimelech, fright-&#xD;
ened. " The boat 's 'most half full o' water ! "&#xD;
" Hold your lantern !" said his father, sternly. A yellow glim-&#xD;
nier of light touched the stack. The shed was not yet visible.&#xD;
" We-'re on the wrong side ! " said Bim. " How did that hap-&#xD;
pen?-0 !. see them sheep !"&#xD;
The boat passed the stack, and came around under its lee. By&#xD;
the light of the lantern, a number of sheep, could now be seen&#xD;
huddling together in the eddies, and holding their noses above&#xD;
water against the side of the stack. As the boat approached,.&#xD;
one of them was seen to lose its hold, and, after a struggle to&#xD;
regain it, fall into the current and disappear. It passed within&#xD;
reach of Mr. Jackwood's hand, but his eyes were fixed elsewhere.&#xD;
" Where is your shed,-- I'd like to know ?" demanded Dick-&#xD;
son.&#xD;
"0 !" exclaimed Abimelech,-- "father, see ! it 's gone ! the&#xD;
shed is gone !"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood sprang up in the boat, thrust his feet in the&#xD;
notches left by the roof of the shed, and mounted the stack. It&#xD;
was his last hope. But no Charlotte was there. 4Only her shawl,&#xD;
which he found freezing fast to a board, against which it had&#xD;
blown, remained as a memento of the night of terror she had&#xD;
passed in that fearful spot.&#xD;
Dickson was not satisfied with Mr. Jackwood's examination.&#xD;
" Here, boy ! " said he, "give me the lantern, and take this oar.&#xD;
Hold it so-fash'n, and keep the boat up against the stack."&#xD;
Abimelech obeyed, and Dickson mounted the stack, after the&#xD;
farmer, lantern in hand.&#xD;
"0 !" screamed the boy, "the boat 's goin' off, and I can't&#xD;
help it!  Father! come!"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood was gazing around upon the waste of waters, in&#xD;
a state of stupefaction, when Abimeleejh's cries aroused him-.-&#xD;

"Reach me the eend o' the oar !" he exclaimed, springing to&#xD;
the side of the stack.&#xD;
"0 ! quick !" cried the boy, "hold the lantern, you man!"&#xD;
"I've got ye ! " said Mr. Jackwood. "Keep tight holt !"&#xD;
And he drew the boat alongside.&#xD;
"Why did n't ye do as I told ye ? " growled Dickson. " The&#xD;
curr'nt pushed the boat against the stack, and all you had to do&#xD;
was to keep the bow from swinging round. Are ye a fool?"&#xD;
" Darn that man-! " said Bim. " I wish he was drownded!"&#xD;
" Hush, Bim'lech ! " said Mr. Jackwood, stepping into the boat.&#xD;
" Gi'me the oars."&#xD;
"What a' ye 'bout? " demanded Dickson, hastily descending&#xD;
the stack. " Come back here ! Take me aboard !"&#xD;
"I got to look out for them 'ere lambs," said- Mr. Jackwood,&#xD;
rowing around the stack.   "Hold the lantern over on this&#xD;
side."&#xD;
Dickson perceived that he was in a precarious position, and that&#xD;
his wisest course would be to comply with the farmer's request.&#xD;
He accordingly climbed over to the opposite side of the stack, and&#xD;
held the light, while Mr. Jackwood pulled the sheep, one after&#xD;
another, over the bow of the boat.&#xD;
"There 's only five out of 'leven," said Bim. "But I'm glad&#xD;
there an't no more; we should sink. 0! the water almost come&#xD;
over the side, then !"&#xD;
" Here ! an't ye goin' to take me aboard ?" asked Dickson,&#xD;
with increasing alarm.&#xD;
"Not with this load," replied the farmer. "I told ye there&#xD;
would n't be room."&#xD;
"Look a' here !" remonstrated Dickson, " there 's room enough&#xD;
there !"&#xD;
"I 've got to bail like anything !" exclaimed Bim, plying the&#xD;
dip er. "Don't{ye go back, father ! I'd leave him there, - I&#xD;
would ! "                                 .&#xD;
"'Tend to your bailing , Bim'lech!" said Mr. Jackwood, sol-&#xD;
emnly.&#xD;
- "An't ye comn'?" cried Dickson. " Don't leave a feller in&#xD;
this way, now ! Han't ye got no human feelin'sl"&#xD;

318                 THE INUNDATION.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood made no reply, but rowed steadily and strongly&#xD;
across the stream. Dickson roared with wrath.&#xD;
"le 's changed his tune, han't he?". said Abimelech. " He 's&#xD;
good to hold the lantern ; we can see the light, and tell where we&#xD;
be. Hear him swear!"&#xD;
"Never mind him," answered the farmer. "Look ahead, there,&#xD;
and see if I'm runnin' into anything."&#xD;
" These sheep, can't stand on, their legs!" said Bim. "They&#xD;
lay right down in the water, and I hadn't hardly got room to bail.&#xD;
Say, father, ye don't think Charlotte 's got drownded, do ye ?"&#xD;
" Are them bushes ahead, there ?  'Tend to what I tell ye !"&#xD;
"We 've passed all the bushes, I guess. I don't see none.&#xD;
1 bet she got off the interval, somehow ; I could. Where do ye&#xD;
s'pose she 's gone to ?"V&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood rowed steadily until the boat struck the ground ;&#xD;
then stepping ashore, with the boy's assistance he drew the bow&#xD;
up out of water.&#xD;
" You won't be afraid, will ye, if I leave ye to take care o' the&#xD;
lambs?  You can git 'em up to the barn some way, if you haf to&#xD;
take one 't a time."&#xD;
" Where ye goin'? to bring him from the stack ? " asked&#xD;
?A.bimelech, timidly.&#xD;
" Not jest yit," replied his father.&#xD;
"II do' wanter stay alone ! " exclaimed the boy. "Le' me go,&#xD;
to the house with ye, and git Phoebe or Rove to come and help&#xD;
with the lambs."&#xD;
" Come along, then," said the. farmer. They had emptied the&#xD;
water out of the boat, leaving the sheep in it ; and, having taken&#xD;
the precaution to drag it a few feet further upon the snow, they&#xD;
set out for the house.&#xD;
"Where do you s'pose. Charlotte is ? " inquired the boy, keep-&#xD;
ing close to his father's side.&#xD;
"All you 've got to do is to git the lambs up ; so, don't ax no&#xD;
more questions," said the farmer.&#xD;
Arrived at the barn, he bridled a horse, and took him from the&#xD;
stable; ;then, without waiting to say even a parting word to his&#xD;
family, he mounted at the gate, anid rode away in the darkness. -&#xD;

RUMORS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"DAUGHTER," said Squire Greenwich, crossing his legs and sad-&#xD;
dling his spectacles upon his knee, " this Sabbath morning appears&#xD;
a fitting occasion, and we will proceed to a settlement." The smack&#xD;
of his precise lips was an awful sound to poor Etty. She came&#xD;
forward, trembling and weeping.&#xD;
"The child is down sick, this morning ! " interceded the&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
" Mrs. Greenwich ! " said the paternal head, " your assistance&#xD;
is not called for. Put down your hands, daughter.". Etty's right&#xD;
hand dropped by her side. "I said, put down your hands !"&#xD;
Down went the left, and up went the right. "D-a-u-gh-t-e-r!"&#xD;
pronounced the squire's warning voice. After a violent struggle&#xD;
with herself, Etty uncovered her pale face and inflamed eyes.&#xD;
" Look at me, daughter ! "&#xD;
Etty raised a timid glance to her father's face ; but a glimpse&#xD;
of Robert's threatening visage opposite immediately put her out&#xD;
of countenance.&#xD;
"The poor child ,has such a cold in her head and eyes ! " inter-&#xD;
posed the mother.&#xD;
"Mrs. Greenwich ! how many- times have I to request that you&#xD;
will not interfere with my discipline? Daughter, innocence is&#xD;
never afraid to look justice in the face ; but guilt is fearful and&#xD;
downcast. We cannot proceed until that I have, your eye."&#xD;
A painful scene followed, during which the affrighted child en-&#xD;
deavored to obey.  Her father's discipline was strict as- mathe-&#xD;
matics ; and she could- no more escape from its laws, than she&#xD;
could make an equilateral triangle with four sides.&#xD;

" That will do," he said, at length, as, with a powerful effort of'&#xD;
will, she fixed her burning gaze upon the end of his nose. "Now&#xD;
I will have your motive for visiting Mr. Dunbury's people, with-&#xD;
out permission."&#xD;
"I was at cousin Charles', - Robert was playing chess with&#xD;
cousin Josephine, -nobody minded anything about me; and, as I&#xD;
wanted to see Miss Woods-" Etty looked down again. She&#xD;
felt Robert's piercing gaze, and forgot to keep her eyes fixed on&#xD;
thapaternal nose.&#xD;
"Go on, daughter. Your eye !"&#xD;
" That is all. I am sorry I disobeyed you, but--".&#xD;
"It remains," said the paternal head, inhaling a pinch of snuff;&#xD;
" that you should show sufficient cause for taking so unusual and&#xD;
unladylike a step. We might imagine circumstances which, by&#xD;
their apparent necessity, would palliate the, offence, and abate:&#xD;
somewhat of the punishment. Have you anything of that sort to&#xD;
advance?"&#xD;
Robert looked daggers into the child's very soul, and she was&#xD;
silent.&#xD;
"Daughter, hold up your right hand !"&#xD;
"Don't be too severe, Mr. Greenwich! Consider, the poor&#xD;
child is down sick -"&#xD;
"Mrs. Greenwich!"&#xD;
"I beg pardon !" and Mrs. Greenwich shrank again into appro-&#xD;
priate insignificance.&#xD;
"The sentence is this: you, daughter Henrietta, for the faults&#xD;
committed and confessed by you, are condemned .to solitary con-&#xD;
finement at home for nine days and an equal number of nights,&#xD;
commencing fromthis hour. During this time, you are to partake&#xD;
of no nutriment but bread and water ; and speak to no one per-&#xD;
son but the paternal head. For each transgression of these regu-&#xD;
lations, one day shall be added to your term of punishment."&#xD;
Etty burst into tears. The punishment seemed greater than she&#xD;
could bear.&#xD;
"Still, if you can advance any sufficient reason for walking&#xD;
through the wet snow to Mr. Dunbury's house, and perilling your&#xD;
health, I shall be gratified to hear it."&#xD;

RUMORS.                       821&#xD;
Etty gave an appealing look to Robert. He knew all; for, on&#xD;
returning home the night before, and telling where she had been&#xD;
and what she had seen, he had seized her as an eagle a lamb, and&#xD;
torn out the heart of her secret. But he was merciless ; he held&#xD;
her with his terrible eye, and opened not his mouth. She would&#xD;
not have wished him to convict himself, to spare her-; she chose&#xD;
to suffer, rather than see his guilt exposed ; but she felt that a&#xD;
word from him might soften her father's severity, and turn aside&#xD;
the sharpness of the penalties.&#xD;
"You're a brave girl !" he muttered, passing'by her ; " only&#xD;
go through with it as you have begun!"&#xD;
He stepped to the door to admit a visitor. It was cousin&#xD;
Charles Creston, a chatty little man, who had called to discuss&#xD;
the occurrences which -to quote his phrase -were agitating the&#xD;
whole village !&#xD;
" Etty brought us the news last night," said Robert, care-&#xD;
lessly.&#xD;
" Bless you ! " cried the chatty little. man, "then you haven't&#xD;
heard the tragical termination ! " Robert, with evident alarm, said&#xD;
he had not. " It 's distressing !  I dropped into the tavern, just&#xD;
now," said the voluble Charles ; " the slave-hunters had just come&#xD;
in, and all the talk was about Charlotte 's being drowned last&#xD;
night.  There can't be any mistake," he added, eagerly; "for&#xD;
one of the men passed the night at Mr. Jackwood's. Charlotte&#xD;
was hid in a stack, then the creek broke up, and the valley was&#xD;
flooded."&#xD;
"0, Robert ! " bu st forth Etty.&#xD;
"One day more added to the nine, my daughter," pronounced&#xD;
the paternal head.&#xD;
"Pshaw!" said Robert, with an incredulous air,-but his face&#xD;
grew deadly pale, - " I don't believe the story !  If 't was true,&#xD;
the men would nQt be so ready to report it."&#xD;
"Why not, since they would wish to give their version first?"&#xD;
cried Mr. Creston. "They throw all the blame upon Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood ; and they are doing all they can to make themselves popu-&#xD;
lar, by treating every loafer in the village who will drink with&#xD;
them. But 't won't do ; there 's a tremendous excitement against&#xD;

-them, and there 's talk that they '11 get tarred and feathered, and&#xD;
rode out of town on rails.  I'd delight to see it!" chuckled&#xD;
Charles.&#xD;
"Son Robert !" called the squire,-Robert had seized his hat,&#xD;
- "where arc you going ? If to the tavern, listen to the paternal&#xD;
counsel, and forbear. Son Robert, do you hear?"&#xD;
Son Robert gave no heed. " Remember ! " he muttered, as he&#xD;
passed by Etty's chair. He left the 'house ; hastened to the tav-&#xD;
ern; moved for a few minutes amid the excited crowd; then,&#xD;
mounting a horse, galloped down the splashy road, with his fierce&#xD;
eye fixed upon the lake that spread over the valley.&#xD;
Throwing himself from the saddle at Mr. Jackwood's door, he&#xD;
knocked for admittance ; but Phoebe and Abimelech were alone,&#xD;
locked up, as in a fortress.  Only Rover's sharp bark answered&#xD;
from within. Robert walked around to the back door ; and&#xD;
Phoebe, observing him from the window, 'ran, with a fluttering&#xD;
heart, to admit him.&#xD;
" Are you alone, Phoebe ?" asked Robert, in a hollow voice.&#xD;
"The folks have gone to meeting; but Bim is here," replied&#xD;
Phoebe, with extreme coldness of manner. " Come in, -if you&#xD;
like." It was his first visit since his desertion of her, some months&#xD;
before; and the memory of her wrongs swelled up within her. He&#xD;
did not stop to-flatter her, or excuse himself; but broke forth at&#xD;
once with inquiries for Charlotte. Phoebe burst into tears.&#xD;
" I'd give my life," he said, - and: remorse and despair were&#xD;
gnawing at his heart, -"to know that she was safe ! She was&#xD;
an angel, Phoebe ; and she was your best friend."&#xD;
"I know it now !" sobbed Phoebe. " But you made me believe&#xD;
she was not ! Why did you?" And she went on to tell the tragic&#xD;
tale. Robert's soul smote him, as he listened ; and when it was&#xD;
finished, without a word he staggered to the door, mounted his&#xD;
horse, and rode back, gnashing his teeth, to the village.&#xD;
0, noble heart of woman ! how little thou art known to selfish&#xD;

Hector, baffled and impatient, was waiting in Mobile. for the&#xD;
steamer to sail that was to take him on his homeward journey.&#xD;
But for the influence of woman soothing and restraining him, his&#xD;
racked mind could scarce have borne its suffering and suspense.&#xD;
How could he have lived through those torturing hours (he after-&#xD;
wards wondered within himself), had it not been for her who en-&#xD;
couraged him to wait, and trust, and to meet all things by heaven&#xD;
ordained to discipline and teach us, with a calm and patient faith,&#xD;
believing in the good ! Mrs. Graves, who had before been Char-&#xD;
'lotte's friend, was now his. On the evening of the day following&#xD;
that of his transactions with Dr. Tanwood, they sat together in&#xD;
the parlor of Mr. Copliff's house. In the midst of their conver-&#xD;
sation, Helen entered, and, taking an ottoman, seated herself at&#xD;
their feet.&#xD;
" I have n't told you about the ball," she began, in her joyous&#xD;
tones. " I had the honor of dancing with Robinson Crusoe, San-&#xD;
cho Panza, and the Wandering Jew. That saucy Count of Monte&#xD;
Christo had the impudence to offer me his hand ! Do you remem-&#xD;
ber "- her voice changed, and she looked up with glistening eyes&#xD;
into Hector's face - "how often I used to sit with you so, a&#xD;
year ago, and make you talk to me? But you do not talk to me&#xD;
any more now !'&#xD;
" Ah, Helen! you will know some day what a mountain rests&#xD;
on my heart !" said Hector.&#xD;
Helen dropped her face upon her cousin's lap, and sat for a&#xD;
long time very quiet and still; but at length, sad thoughts steal-&#xD;
ing over her, sh'e began to weep, and, ashamed of her emotion,&#xD;
she sprang to her feet, and hurried from the room.&#xD;
"Helenis a good girl," said Mrs. Graves, with thoughtful ten-&#xD;
-derness. " Your friend Joseph thinks it the one great mistake of&#xD;
your life, that you did~ not marry her."&#xD;
"0O, Joseph is kind! Had I looked only for beauty, for wealth,&#xD;

" But what are all those attributes, compared with such a soul&#xD;
a0-"&#xD;
"Speak the name ! I love to hear it from your lips."&#xD;
"I am very weak," said Hector.&#xD;
"No, I think you strong!   Your devotion to poor Camille&#xD;
gives me an inspiration as when I read of heroic deeds. In my&#xD;
experience in this groping world, I had almost abandoned the hope&#xD;
of finding a man who could penetrate with the clear glance of truth&#xD;
the thick walls of prejudice and conventionality, which shut us out&#xD;
from the realities of existence. This appears all the more glorious&#xD;
in one who possesses a great power over the human heart, for evil&#xD;
or for good, -like you."&#xD;
" 0, could I but feel that I have always used that power for.&#xD;
good !" said Hector.&#xD;
"Your whole life moves like a panorama before my eye," re-&#xD;
sumed the other, after a pause. " It is pure, compared witi the&#xD;
world's. But you have attained luminous heights, from which,&#xD;
looking down, the paths you lately trod appear all dark and&#xD;
soiled.  It is well to contemplate them at times ; for the sight,&#xD;
repelling you, gives you a nobler impulse to ascend."&#xD;
A sudden spasm- convulsed. Hector's, features. "She calls to&#xD;
me !" he said, faintly. " Just now her cry of anguish shot through&#xD;
me, --nothing could be more terribly real !"&#xD;
The door opened ; he looked up, with a start, as Joseph Spalding&#xD;
entered. "What news ?"&#xD;
"Have you heard from your telegraphic despatch?" asked&#xD;
Joseph, drawing him aside.&#xD;
"No; but you have something for me!" cried Hector.&#xD;
"You are right," faltered Joseph, with a painfully embarrassed&#xD;
manner. "I received this evening a request to call on Dr. Tan-&#xD;
wood."&#xD;
"Speak out!" exclaimed Hector. " What has been done ?"&#xD;
" After our previous interview, you can imagine that a polite&#xD;
note from the doctor took me by surprise. My suspicions were&#xD;
aroused, and I went prepared --&#xD;

"For heaven's sake, omit details, and come to the point !"&#xD;
"I found the doctor extremely civil ; he brought out his decan-&#xD;
ter, we drank, and came to business," said Joseph. " On reflec-&#xD;
tion, he had concluded to accept our offer. 'On reflection,' said I,&#xD;
'we have concluded to withdraw it.'"&#xD;
"Withdraw it?" echoed Hector.&#xD;
"Certainly," said Joseph-; a"for I was sure that if he would&#xD;
take any sum, he would take less."&#xD;
"What have you there ?" demanded Hector. "A letter, -&#xD;
for me!"&#xD;
"tYou shall have it presently," remonstrated Joseph, more and&#xD;
more troubled ; "but hear my story ! "&#xD;
"Give it me !" cried Hector, alarmed and impatient. There&#xD;
was a struggle, and he seized it. Mrs. Graves ran to Joseph,&#xD;
who gave her an appealing look.&#xD;
" It will kill him !" he said. "There is a telegraphic despatch."&#xD;
"From Camille ?"&#xD;
"From the hunters of Camille; it came to Dr. Tanwood. It&#xD;
is terrible ! Hector!" said Joseph.&#xD;
" Drowned ! " gasped Hector, clutching the paper. " They have&#xD;
killed her ! "  He tore away from his friends, and rushed out in&#xD;
the direction of Dr. Tanwood's house, furious to know the truth,&#xD;
and to confront the author of his calamity. Joseph ran after him;&#xD;
but neither force nor entreaty could restrain the frenzied man.&#xD;
Fierce and rapid strides brought him to the doctor's door ; Joseph&#xD;
still clinging to his arm, and urging unheeded words of counsel&#xD;
and consolation.&#xD;
The doctor was gone from home.,&#xD;

XXXVIII-&#xD;
eR. RUKELY'S GREAT SERMON.&#xD;
Mu. RUmr had been all the week engaged in preparing his&#xD;
great sermon on the "Duties of Christian Citizens in the Present&#xD;
Crisis;" a theme adjudged highly appropriate to be considered&#xD;
on the advent of the New Year. No other discourse he had ever.&#xD;
written' had cost him so much labor as this. On Saturday night&#xD;
it was finished. But the young minister's excited brain would not&#xD;
let him sleep ; and towards morning he lay thinking of what he'&#xD;
had written, and imagining the effect it would produce upon his&#xD;
congregation, until he felt an irresistible impulse to get up, strike&#xD;
a light, and read over certain passages, which contained the strong&#xD;
and eloquent points of the sermon. His movements awakened his&#xD;
wife. "Don't be disturbed, my dear," said he. "I am going to&#xD;
write a little."&#xD;
Bertha, languidly: "I thought your sermon was finished."&#xD;
Mr. Rukely, rubbing a match:- "It is, my dear. But there are&#xD;
one or two things I want to alter."&#xD;
Bertha, rubbing her eyes: "I don't see how you can better it.&#xD;
What you read to me last night seemed as good as it could be."&#xD;
"If I remember rightly, it sent you to sleep, my dear."&#xD;
"It was n't the sermon,-'t was the rain. What a storm we&#xD;
have had ! - I am afraid you won't see so large a congregation&#xD;
to-day as you expected."&#xD;
Mr. Rukely, with his fifth match : "The people are looking&#xD;
for my sermon on the New Year ; and I think there will be a&#xD;
pretty general turn-out to hear it, unless the roads should be too&#xD;
bad. There is a lively, interest in the church to know what view&#xD;
I take of the subject. It is generally supposed that -"&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. RUKELY'S GREAT. SERMON.             827&#xD;
" You '11 burn your fingers ! " cried Bertha.&#xD;
" I hope not," replied Mr. Rukely, with a placid smile, drop-&#xD;
ping the match. " Where is the lamp ?"&#xD;
" You must have left it in the other room, where you were&#xD;
writing."&#xD;
In ten minutes Bertha was once more sleeping soundly, while&#xD;
the young minister corrected and interlined passages in his sermon,&#xD;
by the sitting-room fire. He read aloud to himself. "The great&#xD;
danger consists in taking narrow and sectional views of a subject&#xD;
which should only be regarded in a broad, national light. Let&#xD;
us remember that the interests and safety of the country are at&#xD;
stake.  If we would preserve intact the noble heritage be-&#xD;
queathed us by the fathers of American independence, we must&#xD;
listen to the dictates of an expanded and lofty patriotism, and&#xD;
suffer no northern or southern prejudices to sully the bright -"&#xD;
Mr. Rukely thought he heard a voice.    "Did you speak,&#xD;
my dear?"&#xD;
"I thought you called me," said Bertha, half awake.&#xD;
" I was reading," replied Mr. Rukely ; " I had forgotten that I&#xD;
was not in the pulpit. If you would like to hear me, I will leave&#xD;
the door open."&#xD;
" Certainly," said poor Bertha..&#xD;
" Tell me," added her husband, " if you observe any expression&#xD;
that will be liable to misconstruction. It is an extremely delicate&#xD;
subject, and every statement should be worded with care. Watch&#xD;
closely."&#xD;
Bertha promised, and Mr. Rukely'resumed his reading. Hav-&#xD;
ing finished a passage, he called for her criticisms. "To tell the&#xD;
truth," said Bertha, arousing herself, "my mind was wandering&#xD;
again. Do I understand that we are not to protect, a fugitive?"&#xD;
" Is it not just?" cried the minister. "Have we a right to peril&#xD;
the welfare and{ happiness of a nation, by espousing the cause of&#xD;
one man, against the laws made to protect and regulate all?"&#xD;
" It is clear," answered Bertha, "we have no such right." And&#xD;
she fell again into a light slumber, while her husband went on&#xD;
with his reading. Having completed another strong passage. "Is&#xD;
not that argument conclusive ?" he asked, triumphantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC8115-00000165"/>&#xD;
828           MR. RUKELY'S GREAT SERMON.&#xD;
Bertha, starting: "Entirely so ! - But - I ani not sure that&#xD;
I have fully grasped the idea. Will you read the last few sen-&#xD;
tences again? "&#xD;
Mr. Rukely complied readily. But, in the midst of a lofty and&#xD;
eloquent strain, he was disagreeably interrupted by a noise from&#xD;
the kitchen. ;"What's that?" cried Bertha.&#xD;
"Some person at the back door. I wonder who can be stirring&#xD;
at this hour?"&#xD;
" Sunday morning, too !" said Bertha.&#xD;
The minister wrapped his morning-gown about him, and, step-&#xD;
ping into the kitchen, pushed back the bolt, and turned the key in&#xD;
the lock. The day had scarcely *awned. It was snowing fast.&#xD;
A man stood out in the storm, supporting a human figure upon a&#xD;
horse.-&#xD;
"Make way, Mr. Rukely ! " said the man. "'T an't no time&#xD;
for words, an' I 'll ax pardon for intrudin' some other time." As&#xD;
he spoke, he suffered the figure to sink upon his shoulder ; then,&#xD;
clasping it in his arms, he bore it past the astonished minister, into&#xD;
the house.&#xD;
" What is the trouble ? " cried Mr. -Rukely.&#xD;
"The fust thing, help me git this 'ere poor gal to a fire ! " said&#xD;
the man.&#xD;
" This way1! " exclaimed the minister, throwing open the sitting-&#xD;
room door. "Here, sir ! - Wait a minute ! " He wheeled the sofa&#xD;
to the fire, and assisted him to place his burden upon it. " What-&#xD;
has happened to her?" putting back the girl's wet hair, and&#xD;
arranging the cushion beneath her head. "Good heavens ! Char-&#xD;
lotte Woods ! "&#xD;
"She,'s ben drownded, an' then 'most froze to death ! " uttered&#xD;
the man, in a choked voice. "Where's your wife ?"&#xD;
" Bertha ! " cried Mr. Rukely.&#xD;
"What is it? 'Did you say Charlotte ?." articulated Bertha,&#xD;
rushing out from the bed-chamber. "Drowned?"&#xD;
She flew to Charlotte's side, and bent over her, pressing her&#xD;
temples with a frightened, eager gaze. "Charlotte! where have&#xD;
you been? What is the matter, Mr. Jackwood ?" she demanded,&#xD;
wildly.&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. RUKELY'S GREAT SERMON.              829&#xD;
" 'T would be a long story ; we 'd better be-gittin' her dry an'&#xD;
warm fust," said the farmer, rubbing Charlotte's cold hand.&#xD;
" Be calm, my dear ! " remarked Mr. Rukely.  "I will call&#xD;
Matilda--"&#xD;
" Who is Matilda ?" interrupted Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
"Matilda Fosdick, who is living with us," said Bertha.&#xD;
" Livin' with you? " echoed the farmer. "That's bad ! But&#xD;
she can keep a secret, can't she, when a human critter's life&#xD;
depends on't?"&#xD;
"What do you mean ? " cried Bertha.&#xD;
"You han't heard nothin', then, o' what happened up to Mr.&#xD;
Dunbury's, last night ? "&#xD;
"We have heard nothing !&#xD;
"Never mind; you'll hear quick enough ! - If Matilda is a&#xD;
gal to be trusted, call her up. She'd haf to know Cha'lotte was&#xD;
in the house, some time or 'nother, I s'pose. The fust thing to be&#xD;
thought on is to git dry clo's on to her."&#xD;
" Help me roll the sofa into the bed-room," cried Bertha. " I&#xD;
can undress her, and put her into my bed."&#xD;
" We'd better call the doctor," said Mr. Rukely. " He is a&#xD;
trustworthy man, ant if there 's any necessity for concealment -"&#xD;
"We '11 talk about that," said Mr. Jackwood, " arterwards."&#xD;
He assisted in wheeling the sofa into the bed-room, and, leaving&#xD;
Charlotte in Bertha's charge, took Mr. Rukely aside. ---" You 're&#xD;
a man," said he, earnestly, "'t I respect above all others; for&#xD;
you got talents an' larnin', an', more'n all that, your heart 's in&#xD;
the right place. What I should 'a done for Cha'lotte, if 't had n't&#xD;
ben for you, I do'no'. Her an' your wife 's old friends-"&#xD;
"For mercy's sake," interrupted Mr. Rukely, "tell me what&#xD;
the trouble is !"&#xD;
"I do'no' over-'n'-above well, myself," said Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;
" It 's suthin 't dI can't realize nor believe ; but, as I understand&#xD;
it, Cha'lotte 's af~ugitive, an' the kidnabbers are arter her."&#xD;
" A fugitive ! " echoed the astonished minister.&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood: "I hadn't heard her say nothing' 'bout it,"-&#xD;
with a glance towards the bed-room, -" but one thing's sartin, -&#xD;
the officers are arter her, -they 'ye ben to my house, and to&#xD;

Mr. Dunbury's, - an' she 's ben out all night in the storm, to keep&#xD;
away from 'em."&#xD;
" A fugitive ! Charlotte Woods!" repeated Mr. Rukely,&#xD;
aghast.&#xD;
"She was hid in a stack," added the farmer; " but the crick&#xD;
broke up, and drownded her out. She got up on t&#xD;
that was put there arter the winter set in, and the ground was&#xD;
froze : the posts wan't set at all, and the thaw left 'er loose, so 's&#xD;
't when the water come they washed right away. As good luck&#xD;
would have it, the ruf was made o' rails ; they was held together&#xD;
with cleats;"then there was a jag o' straw on top, that had settled,&#xD;
and kep' 'em solid. So, when the ruf tumbled down, Cha'lotte, it&#xD;
'pears, stuck to it. I tell ye what !'it gi' me a start 't I shant&#xD;
git over in a hurry, when we went to the stack in a boat, an' found&#xD;
her mission' ; but her shawl was on the stack, and suthin kinder&#xD;
said to me, 'That never could ot there . in this world, 'itho&#xD;

I was gittin' the lambs into the boat then the idee come to me,&#xD;

round, sometimes, for half a day, 'fore 't goes off down the crick.&#xD;
a knowed the road, an' could find the flats the darkest night, with&#xD;
a hoss ; but ILfelt ticklish about vent'rin' in the boat. So I&#xD;
jumped on ol Dan, an' started off. I found the goin' dre'ful bad;&#xD;
but I got along perty well, till I come to the Turnpike Crossin'.&#xD;
The water was higher 'n I 'd ca'c'lated on, an', to git to the flats,&#xD;
I 'd hatd tocross the crick somehow.. The water was clean over&#xD;
the road, an' Dan did n't like to wade; but I put the whip on to&#xD;
him, an' we got to the bridge. The deestrict's built a famous good&#xD;
g    bge over the crossing ; an' there I stopped to let Dan&#xD;
breathe, an' to look round. It was jest beginnin' to be daylight,&#xD;

but a sheep,' says I; ' but I'm blamed,' says I, 'if it did n't sound,&#xD;
for all the world, like one o' my lambs !' Then I looked sharp,&#xD;
an' see suthin lodged again the knoll, Wal, sir, 't was that shed-ruf,&#xD;
an' Cha'lotte was on to it, holdin' tight to some bushes to keep from&#xD;
floatin' away! I never had anything come over me like that&#xD;
'ere ! But the danger wan't over with yit ; for, if Cha'lotte was&#xD;
to le' go her hold o' the bushes, there was nothing' to tender her&#xD;
gittin' into the main current that run 'neath the bridge. 'T was&#xD;
one o' the maddest currents I ever see ; an' 't would ben a mere&#xD;
chance if the ruf wan't tore to pieces, passin' the 'butments.&#xD;
'Stick to it, Cha'lotte!' says I; ' it 's me' says I. 'Don't be&#xD;
afraid!' says'I. Dan did n't like to leave the turnpike, but he'd&#xD;
ben in the water up to his breast a dozen times already. I thought&#xD;
he need n't mind goin' a little deeper ; so I put on the whip, an'&#xD;
swum him to the knoll. I got hold o' the raftdjes asCha'lotte&#xD;
gi  u;she was nigh-about dead when I lifted her ashore. But,&#xD;
sir, don't ye think, all this time she had kep' two o' them 'ere&#xD;
lambs from drowndin'!  She 'd helped 'em out o' the water,&#xD;
on to the  ro when the shed fell, -- for they could n't got on to it&#xD;
alone, with all their swimming , - and then she'd.took as much&#xD;
care on 'em arterwards, as if there wan't no danger to her, an'&#xD;
all she had to do was to look out for them! I got 'em on to&#xD;
the knoll, an' then lifted her on "to ol' Dan. Then the thing&#xD;
on 't was to git back with her to the turnpike. But I was perty&#xD;
sartin the hoss could touch bottom, an' keep hii nose out o'&#xD;
water, if we both rode; 't want fur, any way ; so I mounted behind&#xD;
Cha'lotte, an' drove in. He is a dre'ful kind hoss,-ol' Dan is, an'&#xD;
k     es 's well what he was about as I did; for&#xD;
he  een e tbee-line t  the turnpike, and went as stiddy as a&#xD;

8382          MR. RUKELY'S GREAT SERMON.&#xD;
what to do 'n I did in the fust place. I could n't take Cha'lotte,&#xD;
to my house, nor to Mr. Dunbury's, for the kidnabbers are as&#xD;
thick over there as nine cats in a corn-basket. When I was con.&#xD;
siderin' on 't, I happened to say, "We an't sich a terrible ways&#xD;
from where Mrs. Rukely lives; she that was Bertha Wing. It 's&#xD;
in the north village,' says I, ' right down opposite the -flats.' All&#xD;
this time I hardly knowed whuther she was alive or dead ; she 'd&#xD;
only said, two or three times," 0, Mr. Jackwood !' an' laid on&#xD;
this 'ere arm, jes' like a child; but when I said 'Bertha Wing,' it&#xD;
seemed to put new life into her.--"&#xD;
" Mr. Rukely," whispered Bertha, at the bed-room door, willl&#xD;
you hand me that blanket ? "  The minister took a garment that&#xD;
was heating by the stove, and passed it to his wife.&#xD;
"Wal," said Mr. Jackwood, "that 's the long and short on 't;&#xD;
and now that she 's safe in your house, I feel like a new man.&#xD;
She 's ben through a dre'ful tough night, an' she may have a&#xD;
fit, o' sickness arter it. If we can keep the kidnabbers away till&#xD;
she 's well enough to be got off to danada, that 's all I ask for.&#xD;
What do ye think ? "&#xD;
"I think -I am in a dream!" exclaimed Mr. Rukely. "Char-&#xD;
lotte Woods ! What a history you tell me ! Do. you think&#xD;
she 'll be safe in my house ?"&#xD;
"I 've an idee ! " said Mr. Jackwood, drying his trousers&#xD;
by the fire. " It popped into my head as I was confin' over&#xD;
here- from  the turnpike.  The kidnabbers 'll think  she 's&#xD;
drownded !  Don't ye see?"   And the farmer proceeded to&#xD;
relate his experience with Dickson, whom he had left holding&#xD;
the lantern at the stack. The inference was, that if Charlotte&#xD;
was supposed to be drowned, the kidnappers would abandon the&#xD;
search.&#xD;
"But if the story should get out," suggested Mr. Rukel in&#xD;
his bewilderment.&#xD;
"Jest make sure o' 'Tildy Fosdick, and I don't see how it,&#xD;
anyways can !" -said Mr. Jackwood. "For my part, I shan't&#xD;
let on to my own family 't Cha'lotte 's found. Then where 's&#xD;
the danger ? You han't no scruples agin keepin' her, of&#xD;
course !"&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. RUKELY'S GREAT SERMON.              333&#xD;
" No scruples,-- that is, the laws of the country-"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood smote the palm of his hand with his fist with&#xD;
an energy that made the other start. "I - I tell ye what."&#xD;
cried he, in a determined tone. "I respect the laws, an' I don't&#xD;
think I 'm a bad citizen, gen'ly speakin'! I don't go in for mobs&#xD;
an' linchin', nuther ! But, come case in hand, a human critter 's&#xD;
o' more account to me than all the laws in Christendom! 'As ye&#xD;
do it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye do it unto&#xD;
me;' that's my doctrine. Christ never stopped -to ask whuther&#xD;
It was lawful to do a good deed, but went and done it ! But,&#xD;
excuse me, -you 're a minister, an' you know better about them&#xD;
things 'n I do."&#xD;
Mr. Rukely grasped the farmer's hand. His eyes glistened,&#xD;
and there was a noble emotion in his face. "You can .depend&#xD;
upon me," said he, fervently.&#xD;
" God bless you sir ! I knowed it !" cried Mr. Jackwood, the&#xD;
tears coursing down his weather-stained cheek. "When there 's a&#xD;
duty to be done to a feller-mortal, you an't the man to stop an&#xD;
look arter the consequences."&#xD;
" Not in such a case," said Mr. Rukely. " I find " -wringing&#xD;
the farmer's hand again --"that there 's a difference between&#xD;
reasoning from the intellect and acting from the heart."&#xD;
"You must have found out that long ago, sence you've begun&#xD;
arly to preach from the heart. I heerd one o' yer sarmons once;&#xD;
't was on the uses o' the Sabbath ; an' one thing you said in it has&#xD;
stuck by me to this day. You said, ' Christ is a law unto himself,&#xD;
and he who has his spirit within him,' you said, ' can do no&#xD;
wrong.'  That spirit is love, an't it ?" cried Mr. Jackwood ;&#xD;
"'t an't policy; and it han't nothin' to do with compromises."&#xD;
"True!" said Mr. Rukely. "It is love, and with it goes&#xD;
faith; and with faith, earnestness and courage, such as yours!"&#xD;
Mr. Jackwood, brushed away his tears, and held the minister's&#xD;
hand in both of his. "I han't no more to say ; but, if I don't&#xD;
come down an' hear you preach to-day, 't 'II be because I can't git&#xD;
over ! I must be goin' now; my folks '11 be consarned about me,&#xD;
an' I olight to git away f'm here 'fore people are stirring. Ion'y&#xD;
want to say a cheerin' word to her, then I 'm off!"&#xD;
&#xD;

34            MR. RTKELY'S GREAT SERMON.&#xD;
Bertha had packed her friend away in the warmest kind of&#xD;
a' nest; and there the farmer found her, unable to move&#xD;
hand or foot, for the comforters that enveloped her, but' not&#xD;
unable to smile a faint smile of affection and thanks upon her&#xD;
preserver. " Mr. Rukely 's all right !" he whispered, bending&#xD;
over her. " So' don't worry; you-'re safe!"&#xD;
Charlotte murmured something ; the farmer did not hear the&#xD;
words, but he felt the thought, for it shone gratefully in his coun-&#xD;
tenance ; and, turning away quickly, to prevent 'a tear from falling&#xD;
upon her face, he called Bertha and her husband.&#xD;
"The best good-by I can say is to leave her in your charge.&#xD;
I '11 hear from ye all, some time!"  The farmer's voice was&#xD;
stifled. "Wal," - with an effort, -"remember I'm coming' over&#xD;
to hear you preach to-day !" He mounted his horse at the door,&#xD;
and rode away in- the storm. Then Mr. Rukely thought of his&#xD;
great sermon lying upon the table, and of Charlotte lying there&#xD;
in the bed-chamber : the one, a creature of his brain, a tissue of&#xD;
ingenious theories and precepts; the other, a living reality, a child&#xD;
of the One loving Father; a being of vital breath, affections, aspi-&#xD;
rations, and an immortal soul.&#xD;
" Will you see if that brandy is hot?" asked Bertha, from the&#xD;
bed-chamber. The brandy was not hot; and Mr. Rukely, glancing&#xD;
furtively towards the chamber, took his great sermon quietly from&#xD;
the table, and thrust it into the stove. "What are you doing ?"&#xD;
cried his wife.-&#xD;
"I am heating the brandy," my dear.'&#xD;
"That was your sermon !" exclaimed the astonished Bertha.&#xD;
My sermon ?" repeated the minister. " Well, I hope it will&#xD;
do good !  I shall preach an old one,-to-day; that one on the&#xD;
uses of the Sabbath, which you must remember, since Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood recalls it to my mind, and quotes from it., I shall preach&#xD;
my sermon for the new year next Sunday."&#xD;
Mr. Rukely was ordinarily a man of such cool temper and&#xD;
calm judgment, that Bertha, who had never known him do so&#xD;
impulsive a thing in all his life, thought himn insane.&#xD;
"s soon 'as you have leisure," said he, " I will give you&#xD;
reasons for what I have done. They will surprise you more than&#xD;
the action itself."&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. RUKELY'S GREAT SERMON.              335&#xD;
Bertha administered the, hot brandy, and rubbed Charlotte's&#xD;
limbs until she got them warm; when the patient appearing to&#xD;
sink into a slumber, she left her, to hear her husband's story.&#xD;
Ah ! if there was a difference between writing a sermon from the&#xD;
head and living one from the heart, so was there between hearing&#xD;
one with the ear only, and feeling one in the soul ! Bertha was&#xD;
awake now ; Bertha no longer gave a cold and drowsy approval&#xD;
of what she heard ; Bertha, whose thoughtless tongue, like many&#xD;
another thoughtless tongue, had said yea and amen to plausible-&#xD;
theories a half-hour since, astonished her husband now by the&#xD;
energy and passion with which she espoused Charlotte's cause.&#xD;
"I did well, then," said he, " to burn the sermon!&#xD;
" I only know," replied the excited Bertha, "that a thousand&#xD;
sermons could not change me with regard to Charlotte ! What&#xD;
shall we do with Matilda ? "&#xD;
Matilda could not be kept in ignorance, if she remained in the&#xD;
house;- neither could her services be well dispensed with at that&#xD;
time. It was accordingly agreed that the safest way would be to&#xD;
confide the secret to her, and rely upon her fidelity. She was&#xD;
called from the chamber ; and Mr. Rukely sat by Charlotte while&#xD;
Bertha, in the other room, awaited the girl's appearance.&#xD;
Miss Fosdick came down with her hair uncombed, and her&#xD;
dress unhooked, looking ill-humored and sleepy. "'T an't late,&#xD;
after all," she said, looking at the clock. "'It's Sunday morning,&#xD;
I thought I could lay abed."&#xD;
I had some news to tell you," replied Bertha.&#xD;
" 0, have you? What is it about ?"&#xD;
"You knowMiss Woods, at Mr. Dunbury's ?"&#xD;
"0, I know of her ; though I 'm not personally acquainted,"&#xD;
replied  Matilda, simpering. "People say Hector is paying&#xD;
attention to her. I don't care, I 'm sure ; though I might have&#xD;
been in her place, I suppose. You did n't know, perhaps, that&#xD;
Hector came for me, the very day he found Miss Woods at your&#xD;
house?  I 'd been two - terms to Kiltney; and Mrs. Dunbury&#xD;
wanted me for a companion. I should have gone, only you&#xD;
know I an't obleeged to go out for a livig; and while we was&#xD;
talking it over, Livia and Patra made such a fuss, all through&#xD;
&#xD;

jealousy, that I concluded to stay to home. Well, Miss Woods&#xD;
went in my place ; but I don't care -she is welcome; though,&#xD;
if I had taken up with the invitation, who knows what might&#xD;
have happened ?  'T an't as though I was in such a great .hurry&#xD;
to get a husband ! But what about her ? Are they going to be&#xD;
married? "&#xD;
"Matilda, it is very sad news I have to tell you !"&#xD;
Matilda, brightening: "Is it ?  I am dying to hear ! "&#xD;
Here Bertha, deeply affected, told the story of Charlotte, yet&#xD;
concealing the fact that she was at that moment sleeping in the&#xD;
adjoining chamber. Matilda could not sufficiently express her&#xD;
wonder and astonishment.&#xD;
" And what would you do," asked Bertha, " if she should come&#xD;
to you, and you could help her escape ?"&#xD;
It. is not to be denied that Matilda felt a secret delight in&#xD;
Charlotte's misfortune. But, aside from the natural envy and&#xD;
selfishness of her -disposition, she was not a bad-hearted girl;&#xD;
and she gave the answer Bertha desired she would. It was as&#xD;
much pride, perhaps, as genuine benevolence, that would have&#xD;
been gratified in rendering assistance to one in Charlotte's posi-&#xD;
tion; but Bertha did not stop to analyze her motives. She&#xD;
believed her sincere ; it was all she asked; and then proceeded to&#xD;
unfold the remainder of the story.&#xD;
Charlotte, meanwhile, passed from the sleep or stupor that&#xD;
had taken possession of her senses into the pain and delirium&#xD;
of fever. Alarmed by her restlessness and moaning, Mr.&#xD;
Rukely rapped on the door for Bertha. She entered ; Charlotte&#xD;
appeared to awake, and she spoke to her; but the poor girl,&#xD;
not recognizing her, called for Hector to give her a glass of&#xD;
water.&#xD;
"Here, dear Charlotte !" said Bertha, raising her head, that&#xD;
she might drink.&#xD;
"No ! "  The sufferer put her feebly away. " Hector ! where&#xD;
is he?"  She looked wildly about the room. Bertha endeavored&#xD;
to pacify her ; but she no longer knew her friends.&#xD;
" I dreamed," said she, " that somebody was drowned in that&#xD;
horrid place ! Tell me, was it Hector ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

HOW DICKSON TOOK LEAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
ON his way home, Mr. Jackwood met Corny riding out of Mr.&#xD;
Dunbury's yard. "You 're stirrin' any, young man," said the&#xD;
farmer.&#xD;
"Ya-a-s," drawled Corny; "I got to go for the doctor."&#xD;
" Is Mis' Dunbury wus agin?"&#xD;
"'Pears so ; they thought she was dyin' one spell. They an't&#xD;
nobody to hum, -now, but Bridget an' the ol' man.  Hector 's&#xD;
gone; an' I s'pose ye heard about Charlotte."&#xD;
"If you 're goin' for the doctor," said the farmer, "I won't&#xD;
hender. I guess I '11 step in a minute, an' see if my folks can, be&#xD;
of any sarvice."&#xD;
The farmer entered' at the kitchen door, which was opened by&#xD;
Bridget.  "Faix ! " cried the girl, "I was never so glad wid the&#xD;
sight iv a Yankee face since the day I was barn ! They 're havin'&#xD;
the craziest time here that iver was! Not a wink have I slept,&#xD;
ahl the whole blissid night, but jist a little this marnin'. I was&#xD;

an' what should I be afther doin', but lavin' the cutter where&#xD;
it stuck, an' ridin' home man-fashion, wid the harness for a&#xD;
saddle ! "&#xD;
" Where is yer crazy-man now ?" inquired the farmer.&#xD;
"I balave the divil has him carryin' him off ! " cried Bridget,&#xD;
" le was up ahl the night, wild as a brindle cat, an' the last I was&#xD;
hearin' on him, he went out howlin' in the star. But it 's little&#xD;
I throuble mesilf about him ; only I tha'ht he might be knowin'&#xD;
what had coom on Miss Charlotte.  If he'd but jist be bringin'&#xD;
her back, then he might go to Bedlam, where he belongs, - bad&#xD;
luck to him ! "&#xD;
For four mortal hours Dickson had kept solitary watch upon&#xD;
the stack. During this time he saw the lantern burn dimly, then&#xD;
go out, and broad day dawn upon the valley and the flood.&#xD;
The weather was growing cold. Only a fine hail fell, mixed with&#xD;
sleet. The straw of the stack froze into brittle glass, and the&#xD;
boards bound upon it became slippery with ice. Dickson would&#xD;
have suffered from the cold and discomfort of his situation, but&#xD;
that his rage kept him warm.' A4 length he saw Mr. Jackwood&#xD;
walk leisurely across the fields with Abimelech, to the water's&#xD;
edge, launch the boat, and row out towards the stack.&#xD;
"I thought per'aps you 'd be impatient to git ashore," remarked&#xD;
the farmer.&#xD;
"Any time !" muttered Dickson, through his teeth.&#xD;
"If he waited long enough, he could cross on the ice," cried&#xD;
Abimelech. " The water 's all scummed over, a'ready, where it&#xD;
don't run fast."&#xD;
" Hush, Bim'lech ! " said Mr. Jackwood. " Doin' my pertiest,&#xD;
I could n't save all them dumb beasts. I 've lost one o' the like-&#xD;
liest pair o' two-year-olds ever raised in the county. The lambs&#xD;
I don't. care so much about, though they 'd a' ben as han'some&#xD;
wethers as anybody's, come spring. Sorry to keep you waitin'."&#xD;
" It 's all right," growled Dickson. "I shall have my pay for&#xD;
this, I reck'n !"&#xD;
" Wal, you 'd oughter !" exclaimed the farmer. " A man 't&#xD;

puts his hand to - your kind o' business desarves to git his pay,&#xD;
Don't forget to hand down that 'ere lantern. Then we'11 go to&#xD;
breakfast."&#xD;
As the wrathful Dickson paid no attention to the request, think-&#xD;
ing only of getting his feet safely planted in the boat, Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood quietly put out his oar, and shoved-off from the stack.&#xD;
"We can't see to git up to the stack, till he holds the lantern,"&#xD;
chuckled Bim.&#xD;
" Hush, Bim'lech ! " said his father. "Thank ye," -as the&#xD;
man, stifling his wrath, handed down the lantern. " Ye han't seen&#xD;
them steers nowheres, have ye ?"&#xD;
TI 've had someth'n' else to think of," replied Dickson,&#xD;
savagely.&#xD;
" Glad to hear it," remarked the farmer. "It 's Sunday morn-&#xD;
in', an' we 'd ought all on us to be thinkin' o' suthin else. But&#xD;
you had sich a chance to look around, up there, I thought you&#xD;
might a' seen 'em, if they was in the woods, or anywheres. Per-&#xD;
'aps ye 'd like to take one o' these oars, to warm ye?"&#xD;
Dickson accepted, without comment, and worked his passage.&#xD;
After a long silence, he inquired, in a sinister tone, what value the&#xD;
farmer set upon his real and personal estate.&#xD;
"D' ye think o' buyin' an' settlin' amongst us?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood. " Took with our manners an' customs, I s'pose ?"&#xD;
" I only asked for information," sneered Dickson.&#xD;
"Wal, in that case, - though 't is Sunday,- I han't no objec-&#xD;
tion to sayin' 't the valley I set on my property, live stock, farm-&#xD;
in' utensils, an' everything, is seven thousan' dollars, cash on the&#xD;
nail. I don't 'spect to git it right away, but I won't part with an&#xD;
acre for less."&#xD;
" And suppos'n' you should wake up, some fine mornin', and&#xD;
find you had n't no farm, nor no seven thous'n' dollars, neither?"&#xD;
"Wal, then Lshould try to git along without 'em, an' be thank-&#xD;
ful for what I did have."&#xD;
"I 'd advise ye to cultivate that feel'n'," said Dickson, " aginst&#xD;
the time comes; an' I prophesy 't won't be slow com'n'."&#xD;
" That 's perty talk from a man 't I 'ye invited to breakfast !"&#xD;
Returned the farmer. -" What d' ye mean ?&#xD;

"I mean that your farm an't any too big tQ cover this little&#xD;
business o' yourn,-ye understand ?"&#xD;
"What business-?"&#xD;
" Harborin' that gal, -if ye relish bein' told in so many words.&#xD;
The wuth of a fine, han'some piece o' property, like her, an't less&#xD;
than fifteen hundred, in the first place. She 's to be paid for, to&#xD;
begin with. Then, say nothin' 'bout imprisonment, there 's fines,&#xD;
I s'pose ye know, that '11 whittle what 's left o' yer farm down to&#xD;
a mighty small figur'; and if ye stand out about it, the law '11&#xD;
swaller up what 's left. I hope that 's a consolash'n for the loss&#xD;
o' yer steers."&#xD;
" It 's Sunday," said Mr. Jackwood, in a low, quiet tone, after&#xD;
a thoughtful pause, " an' we won't talk over business, Ie guess,&#xD;
'fore to-morrer.. But I '11 tell ye one thing, -though I set as&#xD;
much- by my farm as any man, I would n't mind losin' it in a&#xD;
good cause, if I could be o' sarvice to a feller-critter by so doin',&#xD;
an' save 'em from pirates an' man-stealers, like you. That don't&#xD;
make out, though, 't I had any hand in the business you lay to&#xD;
my charge, as I see. If that 'ere poor young woman is&#xD;
drownded, 't an't on my conscience; an' I defy ye to prove the&#xD;
fast thing !"&#xD;
"That '11 be an easy matter," replied Dickson.  "I'm used to&#xD;
these cases."&#xD;
" Wal, I an't, an' I'm glad on 't ! " said Mr. Jackwood. " But&#xD;
le's drop the subject for to-day.  We '11 go to breakfast ; then,&#xD;
if you like, you can ride to meetin' with me. I 'm goin' over to&#xD;
the North Village ; they 've got a famousgood minister there, an'&#xD;
I think 't would n't do you no harm to hear him preach."&#xD;
Arrived at the house, Dickson entered, and warmed himself*&#xD;
and dried his clothes by the kitchen fire. His friend Jones, whom&#xD;
he had expected to call for him early that morning, had not yet&#xD;
made his appearance ; and he was but too happy to avail himself&#xD;
of the farmer's hospitality.&#xD;
" I s'pose," said'he, "you won't object to' lend'n' me a hoss for&#xD;
a couple of hours ?"&#xD;
"I I'11 give ye yer breakfast, and yer last night's lodgin', too,&#xD;

hoss," replied Mr. Jackwood. "I think too much o' both my&#xD;
ponies for that."&#xD;
"ID' ye fancy 't would n't be safe ?" cried Dickson. "I reck'n&#xD;
I'm good for more 'n one hoss."&#xD;
" Per'aps ; but I should want suthin 'sides either yer business&#xD;
or your face to recommend ye, if I was goin' to trust you very&#xD;
fur. Shall we read 'fore breakfast, mother ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood said she thought it would be as well, as the&#xD;
potatoes were not quite done. The farmer accordingly took&#xD;
down the big Bible from the shelf, and called the children to join&#xD;
in the reading.&#xD;
I can't read this morning," articulated Phoebe, whose eyes&#xD;
wdre red and swollen.&#xD;
"Very well; we'll excuse ye," replied her father.   "But&#xD;
don't cry any more, child ; 't won't do no good. You may begin,&#xD;
Bim'lech. If you 'd like to look over," - to Mr. Dickson,&#xD;
"I 'd like to have ye. Give him your Testament, Bim'lech."&#xD;
Dickson declined the offer.  But he could not easily avoid&#xD;
hearing a chapter of the glorious Evangel of St. John, and the&#xD;
simple, earnest prayer that followed.&#xD;
The farmer's voice was tremulous with emotion, and when he&#xD;
prayed that God would -soften the hearts of oppressors, and pour&#xD;
out his tender mercies upon all who were oppressed, Phoebe&#xD;
sobbed aloud ; and Dickson could see the tears run silently down&#xD;
Mrs. Jackwood's face, as she knelt beside her chair. His heart&#xD;
must have been of flint, not to be touched by the scene. He&#xD;
glanced darkly towards the door, as if anxious to get away ; but,&#xD;
with knotted and flushed features, writhing in his chair, he sat&#xD;
and heard the prayer to its close. The ordeal passed, he readily&#xD;
accepted an invitation to breakfast.&#xD;
" There 's somebody come," said Bim, who had gone to the&#xD;
door to give Royer a piece of pork he had-abstracted from the&#xD;
platter when his mother's back was turned.&#xD;
The coiner proved to be Jones. Dickson went out to meet him,&#xD;
and they talked some time under the stoop.&#xD;
" Bim'lech," said the farmer, "tell 'em to put their hosses under&#xD;
the shed, an' come in an' have some breakfast."&#xD;

" I would n't ! " exclaimed Bim, vindictiv ly.&#xD;
"Mirid !" said his father, putting down h's foot.&#xD;
The boy, accordingly, although with a bad grace, delivered the&#xD;
message; and, after some hesitation, the men came in. Mrs. Jack-&#xD;
wood put on an additional plate, flanked with a knife and fork ;&#xD;
and they sat down and ate meat with Christians. When they had&#xD;
made a hasty meal, they arose to go ; Dickson offering to pay the&#xD;
farmer. But Mr. Jackwood declined his money.&#xD;
" Don't you never take pay, when strangers put up with ye?"&#xD;
asked Dickson.&#xD;
" That's neither here nor there," replied the farmer. "What&#xD;
ye have o' me, I give ye.  I neither lend nor sell to sich as you.&#xD;
I've told ye the reason why I won't lend ; if ye want to know&#xD;
why I won't sell, it 's 'cause your money 's arnt in a bad trade,&#xD;
an' I 'd ruther have nothin' to do with 't."&#xD;
"Say, father !" cried Abimelech, after the men were gone,&#xD;
"they can't git yer farm away from ye, can they ?"&#xD;
" You may be sartin," said the farmer, "they will if they can.&#xD;
The law 's on their side, too, I s'pose. But I an't goin' to trouble&#xD;
myself 'forehand. I 've done my best, 'cordin' as I see the duty&#xD;
sot afore me to do ; an', with a clean conscience, I'll wait an' see&#xD;
what comes of it all."&#xD;
" I would n't let 'em have it ! " exclaimed Bim; " I'd sue 'em."&#xD;
"Bim'lech," returned his father, ".I never sued a man in my&#xD;
life, an''I never was sued.  But we won't talk about that now.&#xD;
I 'm goin' to take your mother over to Mist' Dunbury's, an' goin'&#xD;
from there to meetin'; an' you can go with me, or stay to 'hum&#xD;
with Phoebe." And he proceeded to lather his face, and to pre-&#xD;
pare for Mr.?Rukely's great sermon. There were no " chores "&#xD;
to attend to ; those that 4bimelech had left undone having been&#xD;
despatched by the farmer after his return home, while Dickson&#xD;
still kept watch at the stack.&#xD;

MR. CRUMLETT'S SPECULATIONS.&#xD;
Miss MATILTA FoSDICK was not so indifferent to the chances of&#xD;
obtaining a husband, but she entertained a degree of matrimonial&#xD;
hope from the honorable intentions of Mr. Enos Crumlett.  Enos&#xD;
had a consumptive mother, whom he " did n't ca'c'late would be&#xD;
with him much longer," and whom he was anxious to replace with&#xD;
a good wife.  "I can't think o' lettin' my farm," he reasoned,&#xD;
"an' I s'pose 't '11 be enough on 't cheaper 'n the end to git mar-&#xD;
ried, than to hire a housekeeper, or board." He had these con-&#xD;
siderations in mind when he asked-Miss Fosdick for her com-&#xD;
pany;. and perhaps Miss Fosdick also had something of the sort&#xD;
in view when she accepted his advances.  He wanted a house-&#xD;
keeper ; she wanted a house to keep.&#xD;
It was through Mr. Crumlett's influence that Matilda had con-&#xD;
sented to step out of her "sphere" into the domestic service of&#xD;
Mrs. Bertha Rukely. Mr. Crumlett reasoned thus; "'Tildy I&#xD;
guess '11 make a perty smart kind o' gal, keep her away from&#xD;
'Livia and 'Patra. Besides, I don't care about marryin' more 'n&#xD;
one o' Sam Fosdick's darters 't a time ; an' the sooner she breaks&#xD;
with the rest on 'em, the better. -Then, agin, she may as well be&#xD;
arnin' a little suthin for herself, agin spring, for 't an't prob'ble&#xD;
ma 'll hold out much longer 'n that, if she does so long." So&#xD;
Matilda never visited her family now, and had as little intercourse&#xD;
with Olivia and Cleopatra as possible ; a circumstance which,&#xD;
in Bertha's mind, very much favored the project of keeping Char-&#xD;
lotte's presence in the house a secret. But this advantage found&#xD;
an offset, perhaps, in the fact of Mr. Crumlett's visits. He was&#xD;
accustomed to prosecute his courting in Mr. Rukely's kitchen ;&#xD;
and Sunday evening was his regular night.&#xD;

" Wal," said Enos, pulling off his great-coat, and banding it to&#xD;
Matilda, "how d'e deu these times?, What 's the news ?"&#xD;
Matilda, hanging the coat upon a nail: "I don't hear much of&#xD;
anything ; do you?"&#xD;
Enos sat down, and stretched out his legs by the stove.,&#xD;
" They ben having' a tearin' time up the crick, -I s'pose you&#xD;
heerd? "&#xD;
"About Charlotte Woods ?"&#xD;
"Yis; queer, an't it?"&#xD;
"I wan't much surprised," said Matilda, carelessly.&#xD;
"Wal, I was !" exclaimed Mr. Crumlett.   "I knowed her&#xD;
like a book ! She wan't half so black as some white folks 't I&#xD;
know; she was jest dark enough to be ra'al perty."&#xD;
" You fancy dark complexions, I see ! " observed Matilda, with&#xD;
a toss of her head. "I admire your taste !"&#xD;
" Of course I do," -Enos grinned,-" and that 's what makes&#xD;
me like you."&#xD;
Matilda, scornfully : " You don't call me dark, I hope?"&#xD;
"I don't call you nothin' else ! "&#xD;
" Well, if you han't got eyes.! It 's the first time I was ever"&#xD;
called dark."&#xD;
" You 're darker 'n Charlotte Woods,-now, come ! " cried Enos,&#xD;
hitching towards Miss Fosdick's chair.&#xD;
"I?" exclaimed Matilda. "Maybe I be,"- with sarcasm;&#xD;
"you 're welcome to think so, any way ! As if I cared !"&#xD;
"I don't mean,"- Mr. Crumlett saw fit to qualify his asser-&#xD;
tion, - " that is, I did n't say 't your skin is like hern -"&#xD;
"Which you admired so much ! " sneered Matilda.&#xD;
"You an't exactly dark, but - wal, I can't express it ; only&#xD;
you are red, -no, not red, but kind o' red and brown," said Mr.&#xD;
Crumlett.&#xD;
Matilda puckered her lips into a smirk, accompanied by pecu-&#xD;
liar undulations of the head, indicative of contempt, and, taking&#xD;
up a book, pretended to read. Mr. Crumlett hitched his chair&#xD;
still nearer, and looked over the corner of thc book, with a good-&#xD;
natured grin. " I wish you 'd go away !" exclaimed Matilda-.&#xD;
" There !" said Mr. Orumlett ; " that 's all I wanted ! If&#xD;

you 've got sich a temper 't we can't git along together 'fore we're&#xD;
married, what 'u'd we do afterwards? We may as well break off&#xD;
now as any time." And Enos snatched his coat from the nail.&#xD;
" You're as much mistaken as you can be, if you think I was&#xD;
mad!" remarked Matilda. "But, if you want to go, I 'm sure I&#xD;
shan't tender you."  And she kindly offered, as usual, to help&#xD;
Enos " on" with his great-coat.&#xD;
"Thank ye," said Enos; "much obleeged."  He began to but-&#xD;
ton himself up very fast, and put on his mittens. "I 'm glad&#xD;
you 're so willin' to have me go. Where 's my cap ?"&#xD;
"IOf course I 'm willing, if you've got sick of me, and want to&#xD;
break off the engagement!"&#xD;
" Who said I was sick, and wanted to break off?"&#xD;
"You would n't quit so, if you wan't ! " said Matilda, beginning&#xD;
to cry. " It 's you that 's got temper, I should think !"&#xD;
t I? I han't got the least grain o' temper in the world! Look&#xD;
here! I guess we '11 talk that ofer !"&#xD;
And Mr. Crumlett pulled off a mitten. "Set down, won't ye,&#xD;
while you stay ?" asked the weeping Matilda.&#xD;
"No, I won't set down."  Mr. Crumlett pulled off the other&#xD;
mitten, and placed both in his cap. " What do ye mean about&#xD;
my having' temper?"&#xD;
"I meant if you went off so, jest for what I said- "&#xD;
Mr. Crumlett -placed his hat on the table, and sat down, still&#xD;
buttoned to the throat. '"We may as well have it understood,&#xD;
and part friends, for what I see. I 'm sure I han't thought o'&#xD;
breakin' off ; I was goin' 'cause you wanted me to."&#xD;
"Take off your coat, won't ye ?"&#xD;
" No, I guess not." - Mr. Crumlett looked injured. "I'll un-&#xD;
button it, though, while I stop."&#xD;
" You won't feel it when you go out," said Matilda, with tearful&#xD;
affection. "You'd better take it off."&#xD;
"You beat all the gals I ever see !" exclaimed Enos. "You&#xD;
can make a feller do jest what you 're a mind to !- Here it&#xD;
goes!"  The coat was returned to the nail in the wall, and Mr.&#xD;
Crumlett seated himself, all smiles, by Matilda's sides&#xD;
a"I did n't know you was so well acquainted with her," said&#xD;
Matilda.&#xD;

"0, 1 was n't much ! Who said I was?"&#xD;
"Yyu; you said you knew her like a book."&#xD;
"Did 1? 0, wal, all I meant was, that I 'd seen her, and eat&#xD;
dinner with her. You know all about that. 'T was the day her&#xD;
and Hector broke down, and I carried 'em home in my wagon. I&#xD;
made fifty cents by it, --that 's the most I remember. Andlt&#xD;
reminds me 't I made fifty cents to-day, if 't is Sunday."&#xD;
"«How ?" asked Matilda.&#xD;
" Mr. Jackwood found a couple o' his lambs on a knoll jest&#xD;
above the turnpike bridge; and he told me, if I'd git 'em up to&#xD;
my house, and keep 'em till to-morrer, he 'd gi' me half a dollar.&#xD;
I han't got my money yit ; but I shall make sure on 't, when he&#xD;
takes the lambs away. I'd trust him sooner 'n 'most any man I&#xD;
know, any other time."&#xD;
" Why not now ?"&#xD;
"Gracious ! " said Mr. Crumlett, "han't you heard, then? All&#xD;
the talk is, 't he 'll lose his farm, sartin 's the world. The slave-&#xD;
hunters are stoppin' in Huntersford a pu'pose to prosecute him."&#xD;
"That 's too bad!" exclaimed Matilda.&#xD;
" Does seem kind o' tough. But, then, if I owned a slave, and&#xD;
should lose 'em in that kind o' way, I should think 't wan't no&#xD;
more 'n right I should git my pay for 'em. But, arter all, I 'd go&#xD;
agin finin' a man like Mr. Jackwood a cent more 'n the actual&#xD;
damage.   Hang it all ! " exclaimed Mr. Crumlett, "I don't&#xD;
know but I'd done as much for Charlotte Woods, myself! What&#xD;
do ye look so for ?"&#xD;
" So ?  How?" asked Matilda, innocently.&#xD;
" Kind o' so," replied Mr. Crumlett, with a grimace "jest as&#xD;
if you knowed suthin 't you would n't tell."&#xD;
"I? What do you mean?"&#xD;
"You 'd make a feller think you 'd heard suthin about Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood, or Charlotte; for as often as I've spoke of 'em, you 'ye&#xD;
done that,",-another grimace.&#xD;
Matilda put her handkerchief to her face, and chuckled behind&#xD;
it, much to Mr. Crumlett's annoyance. "  Wal, I can't going' to&#xD;
tease," said Enos. -..-" Folks to hum to-night ?"&#xD;
"I I'm to home," answered Matilda.&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. CRUMLETT'S SPECULATIONS.            84i&#xD;
" There 't is agin !-- Is anybody else ?"&#xD;
"You know Mr. Rukely never is to home Sunday nights; he&#xD;
lectures in the vestry."&#xD;
" Is Berthy to hum, then ? " demanded Ends, impatiently.&#xD;
" What difference does 't make to you whether she 's to home&#xD;
or not ?" retorted Matilda, with the same exasperating look.&#xD;
Thereupon Mr. Crumlett, notwithstanding his total lack of tem-&#xD;
per, took offence, and, after some more words, went so far as to&#xD;
put on his great coat and mittens again, and button himself to the&#xD;
chin. This time he pulled his cap over his ears, with a resolute&#xD;
air, that frightened Matilda. He utterly refused to stay, except&#xD;
on one condition; and seized hold of the door-latch, as if unwilling&#xD;
to wait even for that. "Jest as you please," ne mumbled. "Tell&#xD;
me or not,- I don't care !"&#xD;
It is probable that Matilda intended to tell him, from the first;&#xD;
for it would have cost her more forbearance than she ever exer-&#xD;
cised in her life to keep so exciting a secret. His threat of leav-&#xD;
ing her was enough to quiet her conscience ; and, prevailing upon&#xD;
Enos to sit down, she yielded, after a brief struggle, and with an&#xD;
air of profound mystery imparted the story of Charlotte's safety.&#xD;
"Bat she 's real sick ! " continued Matilda. " She don't know&#xD;
anything, but talks such unheard-of things ! Berthy is with her&#xD;
every minute o' the time ; and they 've had the doctor to her twice&#xD;
to-day. Don't you whisper it, for the world ! I don't want even&#xD;
Berthy should know I told ye, for I promised I would n't!"&#xD;
" In this very house !" ejaculated Enos, crossing his legs, first&#xD;
one way, then the other, then getting up, then sitting down again,&#xD;
then embracing his knees with his arms, as if to hold himself&#xD;
together. "Beats everything! What 'u'd them Southe'ners give?&#xD;
Jingoes ! 'Tilda ! it 's the greatest thing I ever heard, in all my&#xD;
born days ! "&#xD;
" Hark! '" whispered Matilda. "IBerthy 's coming!"&#xD;
Dickson and his companions fortified themselves in the village&#xD;
tavern, and appeared to take a brute pride in braving an outraged&#xD;
public. With law, pistols, and the rum-drinking community, on&#xD;
their side, they apprehended little personal danger, as long there&#xD;

848          MR. CRUMLETT' S SPECULATIONS.&#xD;
was no occasion for the active performance of their Union-saving&#xD;
functions. - Whether they were waiting to receive instructions&#xD;
with regard to the prosecution of Mr. Jackwood, or whether they&#xD;
still entertained hopes of hearing from Charlotte, could only be&#xD;
surmised. Perhaps they had both objects in view. They were&#xD;
also very active in procuring information with, regard to colored&#xD;
people, both in the States and in Canada, evidently with the de-&#xD;
sign of seizing some fugitive supposed to have taken refuge in&#xD;
that region.&#xD;
One day, as Dickson was riding over the turnpike, he was&#xD;
accosted by a person passing in the same direction on foot. " Ye&#xD;
look kind o' lonesome, ridin' alone; p'r'aps ye would n't mind&#xD;
giving' me a lift as fur as the Corners."&#xD;
"Jump aboard," replied Dickson. '&#xD;
"The turnpike don't look much as it did about a week ago,"&#xD;
observed the chance passenger, as he pulled the blanket over his&#xD;
knees. " Though p'r'aps you wan't in these parts at the time,"&#xD;
-with a glance at Dickson's face. "The water was up to a&#xD;
hoss's knees all along this road, and a good deal deeper in places.&#xD;
But it fell 'bout as sudden as it riz. It hadn't nore 'n time to&#xD;
freeze over, 'fore down it went, and there wan't nothin' but a scnm&#xD;
of ice left on the interval.. Then the snow come; and now ye&#xD;
would n't know there 'd been a freshet at all. Do you belong in&#xD;
these parts ?"&#xD;
" I 've been stoppin''a few days down here," replied Dickson.&#xD;
Bizness, I s'pose?"&#xD;
" Wal, business and pleasure combined. I wanted to see what&#xD;
kind. o' stuff you Yankees was made of,"- with a grin of insolent&#xD;
good-nature..&#xD;
" You 're from the South, I take it ? "&#xD;
"iWal, I be! The peoplein these digging's have pooty gener-&#xD;

"I guess likely ye remember the freshet, then!"&#xD;
" Wal, I reck'n ! Some things 't an't so easy to rub out !" said&#xD;
Dickson, whipping his horse.&#xD;

"'T was dre'ful unfort'nit 'bout her gittin' drownded!" ob-&#xD;
served Mr. Crumlett, in a friendly tone.&#xD;
iI would n't have had it happen," cried Dickson, " for twice&#xD;
the wuth of her! that 's a fact! But 't an't all over with!"&#xD;
" How do ye git along with Mr..Jackwood?"&#xD;
"0O, we 're gitt'n' along !. Things is work'n'!"&#xD;
"I s'pose there an't no doubt," said Enos, "'bout her bein'&#xD;
drownded -hey ? You give it up as a gone case, I s'pose?"&#xD;
It's mighty doubtful 'bout our ever hearin' of her agin, I&#xD;
reck'n," replied Dickson.&#xD;
"Arter all," remarked Mr. Crumlett, "'t would n't be nothin'&#xD;
so very strange, if she was hid away some'eres right in the neigh-&#xD;
borhood. 'T an't 't all likely, I know; but s'posin' she was?"&#xD;
"'T an't a supposable case, hardly ; and if she was, the next&#xD;
thing 'u'd be to git a clue of her. Gi' me a clue," said Dickson,&#xD;
with professional assurance, "and 't an't easy to trip me up!&#xD;
The gal never 'd got away as she did, if I could have had my&#xD;
way."&#xD;
Mr. Crumlett chuckled nervously. "Wal, there an't no use&#xD;
talkin', if she 's drownded, - but if she only was hid away some-&#xD;
'eres, 't would n't be a bad joke, hey ? You 'd be tickled, I&#xD;

"Wal, I should,- particularly if I got suspicions of it in&#xD;

"Can't help laffin' ! " chuckled Mr. Crumlett; "but, arter all&#xD;
it's no use; there an't a doubt but that she 's drownded; you&#xD;
really think there an't, I s'pose ? "&#xD;
" I'd give," said Dickson, casting a shrewd glance at his com-&#xD;
panion,--" I 'd give a hundred dollars, out o' my own pocket, jest&#xD;
to have sech a clue as I spoke of."&#xD;
"cA hundred dollars ! " echoed Enos, quickly. "You would n't&#xD;
give me a hundred dollars, now, -jest s'pose, for instance -&#xD;
"I tell you what I would do," exclaimed Dickson, " jest for&#xD;
the sake o' talk'n'. I 'd give fifty dollars, cash down, and fifty&#xD;
more in case the gal was found. That 'u'd be fair enough,&#xD;
would n't it ?"&#xD;
' Wal, yis, I s'pose so," said Mr. Crumlett, taken with a gen-&#xD;

" I can fancy your call'n' it fine," returned Dickson. " But&#xD;
I 've had enough of your Varmount winters."&#xD;
" It 's warmer where you be, hey?  Do ye expectt to stop long&#xD;
in these parts?"&#xD;
" That depends altogether upon circumstances. If I could lay&#xD;

"ha ! ha ! it makes me laf!" said Mr. Crumlett. " What if&#xD;
I could find out 'suthin about her ?- though 't an't possible, of&#xD;
course!"&#xD;
" Hold them 'ar lines a minute, if you please."  Enos took the&#xD;
reins, and his companion, pulling off his driving-gloves, brought'&#xD;
up from the depths of his pocket a handful of gold. "Three -&#xD;
six -nine, - there 's twelve half-eagles ; that makes sixty dol-&#xD;

"A hundred and twenty ! " interrupted Mr. Crumlett.&#xD;

"What do ye s'pose 'u'd be done with her, if she should be&#xD;

chatter ! -" but never mind! I could n't find out nothin', if I&#xD;
should try. So, 't an't no use talkin'. Though, by gracious! I'm&#xD;
a good mind to inquire 'round,! You won't be drivin' this way&#xD;
to-morrer 'bout this time, will ye ?"&#xD;
"I don't know but I shall," returned Dickson; " why?"&#xD;
" Wal, nothin'," said Enos. "But, then, if you 're goin' by,&#xD;
wal, I don't know, if you should turn into that 'ere road you&#xD;
passed jest t'. other side o' the secont house over the crick, per'aps&#xD;
you 'd find me choppin' on the edge o' the woods. ~I don't 'xpect&#xD;
to find out anything; but, if I should," -chatter, chatter ! shiver,&#xD;
shiver !-" wal, on the hull, I guess 't won't be wuth while to&#xD;
think about it! "&#xD;
" I'll make it wuth yer while !" .And Dickson, giving Mr.&#xD;
Crumlett's hand a hearty shake, left a piece of money in it.&#xD;
"pThat 's to pay ye for your trouble, any way. Come, ride over&#xD;
to the tavern, and take suthin! "&#xD;
" Can't possibly !" said Enos, getting out of the sleigh.&#xD;
"Wal, see ye to-morrer ! " exclaimed Dickson, confidentially.&#xD;
"Make it all right, ye know ! Take care o' yerself, old boy!"&#xD;
He drove away. Poor Crumlett ! how he did shiver, as he gazed&#xD;
after him! He could n't tell why he shivered,-the day was not&#xD;
extremely cold, -and now he discovered that the perspiration was&#xD;
starting from every pore of his skin.&#xD;
"A HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS !" - Chatter, chatter ! shiver,&#xD;
shiver! again; and Mr. Crumlett wiped the cold sweat-drops&#xD;
from his face. He thought he was going to have a "shake of the&#xD;
ager;" but it was worse than that : he had caught the worst&#xD;
kind of yellow fever, from the sight-of Dickson's gold.&#xD;

CONFESSIONS.&#xD;
CHARLOTTE raised her head feebly from the pillow, with a&#xD;
troubled expression; but, perceiving Bertha, who sat watching by&#xD;
the bedside, a faint, grateful smile stole over her wan features.&#xD;
"0," said she, with deep emotion, "you are always watching!&#xD;
Good Bertha ! dear Bertha ! I should have died but for you !&#xD;
have been very sick, have I not?"&#xD;
" Very sick," replied Bertha, taking the poor girl's hands in&#xD;
hers. "0O, 1 am so thankful to see you better now !"&#xD;
" I am afraid my mind is not quite right, as yet," Charlotte&#xD;
said. " Every noise startles me. I thought, just now,.some per-&#xD;
sons I feared were rushing into the room."&#xD;
" It was grandmother, who looked in, to ask how you were."&#xD;
" And Hector ?" said Charlotte. 14Something has happened to&#xD;
him ! God help me, if he does not come soon ! I am still hunted;&#xD;
and I lie here sick, while I should be hastening to a place of&#xD;
safety ! But I will not repine. - Tell me, Bertha ! did I talk&#xD;
much in my fever?,"&#xD;
" A good deal, at times," said Bertha.&#xD;
"Will you tell me all I said ?"g&#xD;
" I. did not try to remember anything, because you were delir-&#xD;
ious."&#xD;
"I wish you would tell me!" said Charlotte, with a troubled&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
Bertha drew near ; her cheeks changed their color, and her&#xD;
lips quivered; but, bending affectionately over the pillow, she&#xD;
whispered something which made the sufferer start and clasp her&#xD;
hand upon her heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
CONFESSIONS.                   353&#xD;
"tIt is true, Bertha'! " faltered Charlotte.&#xD;
You are his wife ! " said Bertha ; and her features seemed&#xD;
transfixed with pain.&#xD;
"«You are not glad to hear it!" said Charlotte, sadly. " You&#xD;
think that one in my position --But, believe me, Bertha, it&#xD;
was his Lova ! Perhaps I should not have yielded. I know I have&#xD;
destroyed the peace and the pride of his family,-- but, 0, Bertha,&#xD;
do not you hate me for it! do not! You are happy; you are&#xD;
united to the man you love ; and I am glad for you ! And you -&#xD;
in your place - do not judge me harshly, - do not, good&#xD;
Bertha ! "&#xD;
"0, Charlotte! " Bertha cried out; "if you could look into&#xD;
my heart! You have not understood me ! And I have not&#xD;
understood myself.till now !"&#xD;
"You know me now, what I am," said Charlotte. "If you&#xD;
still love me and trust me, why not open our hearts to each&#xD;
other?  I will show you all of mine -"&#xD;
"But mine ! " exclaimed Bertha, -" 0, what a wayward thing&#xD;
it is! You would hate me, Charlotte!"&#xD;
"Hate you, dearest Bertha !"&#xD;
"=Yes, - for just now I hated you; I had something like death&#xD;
oryouinmysoul! You did not know-thatJI-thatI-loved&#xD;
Hector!&#xD;
" Bertha ! Bertha ! " moaned Charlotte.&#xD;
"What frenzy has forced me to tell you?" cried Bertha. " But&#xD;
you will not hate me ; you will not betray me ! I must confess&#xD;
myself to you, or the weight that is on my soul will kill me ! I&#xD;
love my husband ; - for he is good, and how could I not love him ?&#xD;
- but not as a wife should love a husband ! I never did ! I believed,&#xD;
I hoped I should, when we were married. But I shrink from his&#xD;
near approach. I am repelled from him by every instinct and&#xD;
feeling of my nature. Charlotte, tell me what to do ! "&#xD;
Charlotte, in her amazement and pity, could not utter a word.&#xD;
" I am no longer jealous," Bertha went on. " I felt but one&#xD;
sharp, piercing pang, when you told me you were Hector's wife.&#xD;
I gave him up long ago; I have schooled myself to resignation;&#xD;
I pray for his happiness and yours, from the depths of my heart.''&#xD;

854                    CONFESSIONS.&#xD;
" I know you do !" said Charlotte. "0, Bertha ! poor, dear&#xD;
Bertha ! what can I do for you ?- Do not sob so ! "&#xD;
"I will not," returned Bertha, struggling with herself. "I&#xD;
have no right to lay my 'burdens upon you. Yet I needed to&#xD;
confess myself to some one."&#xD;
"IAnd you deemed me worthy." Bertha kissed her friend. "0,&#xD;
sister'!" breathed Charlotte, " your lot is hard ! Butduty will&#xD;
sustain you, and prayer will make you strong."&#xD;
"I do not know," exclaimed Bertha, wildly. "I thought I&#xD;
did my duty when I married. I see now how it was. I silenced&#xD;
my nature ; I stifled my deepest convictions ; I followed the&#xD;
dictates of calculation. But I thought I was doing right. And,&#xD;
if I could then be so deceived, how can I ever be sure of the truth?&#xD;
I dare not even pray ! In the very act horrible promptings come&#xD;
to me. It is as if Satan mocked me!"&#xD;
" Perhaps," said Charlotte, "this is the punishment for diso-&#xD;
beying your deepest convictions. The Spirit has been grieved&#xD;
away. But seek it again, and it will come ; it will teach you&#xD;
what to do."&#xD;
",You comfort me, Charlotte ! But, 0, the fatal error ! - I&#xD;
had not the heroism to live an old maid; that is it! Mr. Ruke-&#xD;
ly was good - he was a minister - I desired a home, and a&#xD;
position. And, as I could not have the one I loved, I flattered&#xD;
myself I ought to marry him. I called esteem and friendship&#xD;
love; I made expediency appear a duty. Do not think I have&#xD;
been disappointed in my husband. He is all I expected, and more;&#xD;
he is too good to me. Only - we do not belong to each other.&#xD;
And, Charlotte, was it not a great sin ? "&#xD;
Charlotte shuddered involuntarily. A long silence followed.&#xD;
" You have something to say to me of yourself," uttered Bertha,&#xD;
at length.&#xD;
"Yes; but Iam too weak now. To-morrow, if I am stronger-"&#xD;
" To-morrow, then, dear Charlotte !-I will wait. We' will&#xD;
both be stronger then." And Bertha embraced her friend, hold-&#xD;
ing her long in her arms, and kissing her fervently.&#xD;
On the following day, Bertha, having an hour's leisure, came&#xD;

in and sat down by the convalescent's side.  "You were to tell&#xD;
inc something," she said.&#xD;
"Yes, dear Bertha. But sit nearer. I want your hand in&#xD;
mine.&#xD;
Having raised her friend to an easy position, and braced her up&#xD;
with pillows, Bertha sat upon the side of the bed, holding her&#xD;
'r      hand, and supporting her in a half-embrace.&#xD;
"It is the story of my life, Bertha. Camille is the name my&#xD;
-I     father gave me.   He was a French merchant, named Antoine&#xD;
iDelisard. In his youth he had been attached to a young girl, -&#xD;
my namesake ; but both were poor, and, on a visit to Louisiana,&#xD;
be became acquainted with a lady whose wealth and accomplish-&#xD;
ments fascinated him, and they were married. It was an unhappy&#xD;
union. She proved a cold and heartless woman, with nothing in&#xD;
her nature to compensate him for the sacrifice of poor Camille. A&#xD;
separation took place ; and he was about returning to France,&#xD;
when, by chance, he saw my mother. She belonged to a bankrupt&#xD;
estate ; she was to be sold ; and he purchased her; She was then&#xD;
seventeen. I think she was beautiful. She was the child of a&#xD;
white father, and of a mother scarce darker than himself. She&#xD;
was not wanting in education and accomplishments. Brought up&#xD;
in her father's family, she had' received the same advantages&#xD;
with his legitimate children. My father loved her ; and the&#xD;
difference in their ages did not prevent her returning his attach-&#xD;
ment with all the fervor of her nature.&#xD;
"I was their only child. We lived in a pleasant part of the&#xD;
city, where not more than half a dozen friends came to visit my&#xD;
father in the course of the year. He seemed entirely absorbed in&#xD;
his affection for my mother and me. I was his pet. I remember&#xD;
how playfully he used to snatch me up in his arms, when he&#xD;
returned home at night from his work. I~t was joyful times then !&#xD;
My mother was proud and happy. Sometimes they took me with&#xD;
them into the country ; and I recollect that once there was a great&#xD;
storm; the wind broke down trees,' and tore them up by the roots,&#xD;
and my father's hat flew away in a cloud of dust. He held me in&#xD;
his arms, to prevent my flying away too. At first I thought it&#xD;
great fun, and clapped my hands ; but afterwards I cried with&#xD;

fright, while my father ran with me across a field, in a high wind,&#xD;
to a house which remains as distinct a picture in my mind as if I&#xD;
had seen it yesterday. A few such incidents form prominent&#xD;
points in my memory of those days ; the rest is smooth and quiet.&#xD;
" When we were alone, my mother used to occupy herself in&#xD;
teaching me to read and write. If I was indolent, she excited my&#xD;
ambition by reminding me of my father, whose praise and encour-&#xD;
agement made my little heart beat proudly and happily. I remem-&#xD;
ber his saying to me, one day, ' You will shine with the rest of&#xD;
them, when we go.to France.' I was sitting on his knee repeating&#xD;
a-lesson my mother had taught me. I looked in his face-I&#xD;
think of it now as such a kind, good face ! -and asked what he&#xD;
meant by going to France. ' You will know, one of these days,&#xD;
darling!' said he, - and, kissing me, he took me in his arms and&#xD;
hugged me tight. For a good many days I thought of what he&#xD;
had said.  I asked my mother what he meant; she told me&#xD;
that France was a beautiful country away over the sea, and that&#xD;
we were all going there together, as soon as my father was rich&#xD;
enough, so that we could live in grand style, and spend as much&#xD;
money as we pleased. She seemed elated with the idea, and of&#xD;
course I thought it fine; but an old negro servant we had laughed&#xD;
at us, and told us she had heard too many such stories to believe&#xD;
them. That was the first time I ever saw my mother angry. She&#xD;
threatened to have the old woman whipped; but she only laughed&#xD;
the more, showing her hideous gums and broken teeth, which I&#xD;
remember to this day.&#xD;
"After that we talked a great deal about France. But we&#xD;
were careful not to let the old woman hear us; and, if she entered&#xD;
the room, we were silent. My mother excited my imagination.&#xD;
with romantic stories, repeating what my father had told her,&#xD;
with a thousand exaggerations. I thought of nothing, dreamed&#xD;
of nothing, but France. But one day my father came home with&#xD;
a headache, and went to bed. The next I remember, the house&#xD;
was filled with strangers; I was terrified, and my mother was&#xD;
frantic. There was a tall, pale, severe woman, who had her&#xD;
servants and doctors, and who would not let us go into the room ~&#xD;
where he was. One day, however, my mother armed herself&#xD;
&#xD;
CONFESSIONS.                    357&#xD;
with a knife, and rushed into the room, dragging me after her.&#xD;
There was a pallor and fury in her looks which frightened the&#xD;
attendants away, and for some time we had sole possession of the&#xD;
chamber. My father called her his brave girl; and, although he&#xD;
was very sick, he pressed us in his arms, declaring that we should&#xD;
not be taken from him again. But suddenly he fell back. My&#xD;
mother screamed. The pale woman rushed in, and we were car-&#xD;
ried out. .I remember my mother clinging to the bed, from which&#xD;
she was torn by main force, struggling and shrieking; then we&#xD;
were locked up in a solitary room. I knew, from her grief and&#xD;
despair, that my father was dead. I had little knowledge, how-&#xD;
ever, of the destiny that awaited us. I cried because he could not&#xD;
go with us to France ! I wondered if we should go without him !&#xD;
" The pale woman was his wife. By law, we were a part of&#xD;
his property, and she and her children were his heirs. Then we&#xD;
learned what it was to be slaves! My mother had almost forgot-&#xD;
ten; I had never known. I became the companion of slave-chil-&#xD;
dren, on a plantation owned by Mrs. Delisard's father. I was&#xD;
half-clad, like them; I ate their coarse food; I slept in their mis-&#xD;
erable huts."&#xD;
" And your mother?" said Bertha.&#xD;
"She was kept as a servant in the house. -I did not know,&#xD;
then, how much she was to be pitied. The change in her own&#xD;
condition was not her hardest trial.  To see me, her darling&#xD;
growing up with children of an ignorant and degraded class, was&#xD;
more than she could bear. One day Mrs. Delisard brought a lady&#xD;
to visit the plantation. It is one of the most terrible days'in my&#xD;
remembrance. I do not know the immediate cause of the out-&#xD;
burst; but my mother lost all command of her temper, and poured&#xD;
forth a volley of indignation and anger against her mistress, of&#xD;
which I had a vague consciousness of being in some way the sub-&#xD;
ject. Mrs. Delisard said, The child shall be sold!' Her pale-&#xD;
ness frightened me more than my mother's violence. During the&#xD;
scene, a young man rode up, and, throwing himself from his horse,&#xD;
K   struck my mother with the butt of his riding-whip across the tem-&#xD;
pies. It was Mrs. IDelisard's son -"&#xD;
" Your brother1" ejaculated Bertha.&#xD;

"I suppose so !-- My mother fell to the ground, and was car-&#xD;
ried away insensible. I never saw her again."&#xD;
"She.lied !n'&#xD;
"0, no ! she was not so happy ! There was a place on the&#xD;
plantation where the worst field-hands were, on extraordinary oc-&#xD;
casions, confined for bad behavior. It was a wretched, dismal&#xD;
pen, which the superstitious slaves had peopled with imaginary&#xD;
horrors ; and to be imprisoned there over night was looked upon&#xD;
as a more dreadful and degrading punishment than whipping.&#xD;
There my mother was shut up, and the great black padlock was&#xD;
put upon the door. I heard Mrs. Delisard say, 'to humiliate&#xD;
her,' - and for years after I could; not hear the word humiliate,&#xD;
without associating it with all that was gloomy and terrible."&#xD;
" How long was she kept there?"&#xD;
"'I do not know. No person was allowed to go near her. The&#xD;
slaves huddled together that night, and told over all the stories&#xD;
which could be .remembered or imagined in connection with the&#xD;
jail. There was a tradition of an old negro who- died there, one&#xD;
night, years before, in consequence of a cutting-up, or flogging,&#xD;
and whose ha'nt, or apparition, was sure to manifest itself when-&#xD;
ever there were any troubles on the plantation. One of the story-&#xD;
tellers, who had passed a night in the jail, declared that he heard&#xD;
the old negro shelling corn on a shovel until three o'clock in the&#xD;
morning. The rest related similar superstitions, frightening them-&#xD;
selves and each other, until they scarcely dared separate for the&#xD;
night. For my part, I was glad to creep into the bunk with the&#xD;
other children, and cover my eyes, for fear of seeing the ghost of&#xD;
the old negro. How I trembled for my mother ! I was too ter-&#xD;
rified even to cry.&#xD;
"The next morning, after the hands _had gone to the field, I&#xD;
was waiting anxiously to know what would be done with my&#xD;
mother, or if she was still alive, when there was an inquiry made&#xD;
for me, and the children whispered that 'Milly was going to be&#xD;
sold !' "&#xD;
"Who was Milly?" inquired Bertha.&#xD;
" If you had seen. all eyes turned upon me, with shy and won-&#xD;
dering looks, you would have discovered who Milly was! That&#xD;

CONFESSIONS.                    859&#xD;
was the nickname of Camille. I was marched out for inspection.&#xD;
The overseer of the plantation turned me around, and made me&#xD;
show my arms and knees to astranger, who was going to buy me.&#xD;
I remember the man's saying that I looked sickly, and the over-&#xD;
seer's saying that it was 'nat'ral white.' Tlen they walked away&#xD;
tegether, to conclude the bargain. I saw the overseer point&#xD;
towards the jail; and it seemed to me that he was explaining why&#xD;
I was to be sold, and telling about my mother. All this time I&#xD;
could say nothing but 'Don't sell me ! please don't have me&#xD;
sold!' I was sobbing, when one of the servants came to take me&#xD;
to the piazza, where Mrs. Delisard was walking with her visitor.&#xD;
The lady spoke to me kindly, and asked me how I would like to&#xD;
have her buy me. I said I did not want to be sold. 'But you&#xD;
would rather go with me than with that man, would you not?'&#xD;
said the lady. 'I want to go with my mother,' said I, ' and I do&#xD;
not want to be sold.' Then she said something aside to Mrs. Del-&#xD;
isard. I only heard Mrs. Delisard's reply that she was deter-&#xD;
mined. I thought it was something awful to be determined; 'for&#xD;
I.was wise enough to see that there was no mercy in her heart for&#xD;
either my mother or me.&#xD;
" I was sold, and carried away that day. I remember strug-&#xD;
gling and crying to see my mother again; after, which, I can&#xD;
recall nothing, until I found myself in my new home. It was at&#xD;
the house of the lady who had purchased me. She came and&#xD;
asked me how I was, as I lay upon a bed, in a room in which I&#xD;
had awaked without even knowing how I was brought there. I&#xD;
begged to be taken back to my mother. It was not until years&#xD;
after that I heard anything definite with regard to her fate.&#xD;
Then-I learned that, on coming out of the jail, she never laughed&#xD;
again, or spoke, unless she was addressed. Her spirit was crushed.&#xD;
She pined away, and her owners tried to sell her; bat she had&#xD;
become unfit for any labor; and, in the course of afew months,&#xD;
she died."&#xD;
"Your own mother !'" said Bertha.&#xD;
"Alas, Bertha!" continued her friend, wiping her tears, "I&#xD;
had already divined her fate. For a long time after I was sold,&#xD;
SI felt her spirit crying out for me, and refusing to be comforted.&#xD;

But at length she seemedto come to me ; and one night I had&#xD;
such perfect consciousness of her presence, that I firmly believed&#xD;
she had been near. The next night, I felt her presence again.&#xD;
She told me in a dream  that she was free, and that she would be&#xD;
with me always, to guard and strengthen me. By degrees the&#xD;
truth revealed itself, and-I knew her spirit had attained that free-&#xD;
dom which did not exist for her on earth.&#xD;
" Like Mrs. Delisard, my new mistress was a widow; she was&#xD;
gay and independent ; but she had a benevolent heart, and, from&#xD;
the first, she treated me with a great deal of kindness.  She was&#xD;
naturally impatient; but, as I became accustomed to her habits&#xD;
and caprices, I could wait upon her and please her better than&#xD;
any one else. I think she had a real affection for me. I could&#xD;
tell you a.great many anecdotes about her ; but I will relate only&#xD;
one or two, which make points in my own history. As I had&#xD;
much leisure time, I' used to amuse myself with reading such&#xD;
books as I could steal from the library and return without danger&#xD;
of discovery.  How Mrs. Beman cane to suspect the habit, I&#xD;
never knew; but one day she, said to me, ' Milly, can you read?'&#xD;
'I could read a little once,' I acknowledged, tremblingly. After&#xD;
a few more such questions, which I answered evasively, she said,'&#xD;
'Take my advice, Milly, and do not read any more. It is a bad&#xD;
practice for girls in your condition.  Servants have no business&#xD;
with books. Above all, do not read such stories. as the Bride of&#xD;
the Forest ; they will only serve to put idle fancies into your&#xD;
head, and make you unhappy.',&#xD;
" The Bride of the Forest was the book I had been reading&#xD;
that very day !  I said nothing, but went away and cried. That&#xD;
night Mrs. Beman called me to her, after she was in bed.  ' Take&#xD;
this book,' said she, ' and show me how well you can read.' The&#xD;
book was the Bride of the Forest ! I felt my cheek burn, and my&#xD;
voice trembled as I read. But, after a little stammering, I got'on&#xD;
very well.  Mrs. Beman praised me.   'It is quite interesting,'&#xD;
said she.  ' Continue ; but do not try to read so fast.' I was en-&#xD;
couraged.  I read chapter atercapter, waiting for her to tell&#xD;
me to stop. At length I glanced furtively from the page,. to&#xD;
observe her expression. She was fast asleep. From that timo&#xD;

1343&#xD;
one of the pleasantest duties I had to perforin was to read her to&#xD;
sleep.&#xD;
" An unfortunate occurrence put an end to this recreation.&#xD;
Mrs. Beman married.   She took home a handsome young hus-&#xD;
band, several years younger than herself. The. servants said&#xD;
among themselves that he married her for her property, and she&#xD;
him for his beauty. They liked the change; and not enough&#xD;
could be said in praise of the new master. He was careless, lib-&#xD;
eral, and indulgent. Everybody was happy but me. I found the&#xD;
coarse society of the servants a poor recompense for the delicious&#xD;
nights I used to spend reading to my mistress.&#xD;
"But it was not long before I met with another change of for-&#xD;
tune. One day, my mistress called me to an account. ' Milly,'&#xD;
said she, 'how do you like Mr. Woodbridge?' ' He is a good&#xD;
master,' said I; 'all the servants like, him.' 'He is kind to&#xD;
you, Milly, is he not ?' ' 0, always !' said I. ' Indeed,' said my&#xD;
mistress, 'he has taken a particular fancy to you, has n't he?' I&#xD;
trembled, and blushed, and said I did not know. ' 0,' said she,&#xD;
laughing,-it was a laugh I did not like,-'you know very well&#xD;
whether he fancies you or not. Did he ever kiss you?' 'No,&#xD;
said I, earnestly, 'he never did !' ' Did he ever try?' she asked,&#xD;
in a quiet, significant tone, which told me that she knew every-&#xD;
thing. ' Be honest, Milly, and tell me the truth.'&#xD;
"«Although I had learned to lie in her service, without doing&#xD;
the least violence to my conscience, I could not compose my face&#xD;
to lie to her. 'Yes,' said I, 'he tried once -in fun.'--' And&#xD;
once afterwards, in earnest - eh, Milly?'- 'But I would n't let&#xD;
him!' I protested, looking her full.in the face. ' I believe you,'&#xD;
said my mistress. 'He is coming,' she added, starting from her&#xD;
seat. ' Tell him I am in the garden.'&#xD;
"She stepped into the alcove, just as Mr. Woodbridge entered&#xD;
the room. ' Where is your mistress, Milly?' he asked. 'I don't&#xD;
know, sir,' said I. ' I reckon she 's in the garden.' He pulled&#xD;
me by the arm, and tried to make me sit upon his knee. 'You&#xD;
are the queerest girl that ever was !' said he. ' What 's the rea-&#xD;
son you won't let me kiss you?' I told him that he was my mis-&#xD;
tress' husband, and that she was very fond of him. -' And so am&#xD;

I of her,' said he ; ' but that don't hinder my liking a pretty&#xD;
young face like yours, you know. She was young once, but that&#xD;
was a good while ago. Don't tell her I said so, unless you want&#xD;
her to take both our heads off!'&#xD;
" He was trying to kiss me again, and I was fighting him away,&#xD;
when he suddenly let me go. My mistress was coming out cf the-&#xD;
alcove. 'That will do, George !' said she, smiling, with her fore-&#xD;
finger raised. But her cheek was pale, and there was something&#xD;
bitter and vindictive in her smile. I never saw so blank a face&#xD;
as his ! ' You may ego, Milly,' -and I ran from the room. Two&#xD;
or three days after, she called me to her, and, talking to me&#xD;
kindly,-though not with the frank good-nature with which she&#xD;
used to talk to me, told me she thought it best for me to have&#xD;
another mistress. 'Don't cry, Milly,' said she. 'You are a good&#xD;
girl, and I have found a good mistress for you. It is Mrs. Graves.&#xD;
She has coveted you ever since I told her, long ago, that I had a&#xD;
servant to read me to sleep. Her husband is an. old man; and&#xD;
there will be little danger of his liking you too well.'&#xD;
"All this was some consolation. But I was attached to Mrs.&#xD;
Woodbridge, and could not bear the thought of leaving her. I&#xD;
did not -know, until afterwards, how really kind she had been.&#xD;
She had sold me at a sacrifice to Mrs. Graves, in order to secure&#xD;
for me a good mistress; although she might have obtained a much&#xD;
higher price for me, at the hands of speculators."&#xD;
"How strange it sounds, to hear you speak of being bought and&#xD;
sold ! " exclaimed Bertha.&#xD;
"It sounds strange to me, too, Bertha! All this part of my&#xD;
life seems like a dream, as I look back upon it. Mrs. Graves&#xD;
was very young. She had married when a mere child, to please&#xD;
an ambitious parent; her husband was old and jealous. She had&#xD;
suffered extremely before I saw her; but she had naturally a pa-&#xD;
tient temper, and a spiritual mind; and she found her consolation&#xD;
in the deep realities of a religious life. I never cease to be thank-&#xD;
ful to the kind Providence that placed me under her influence.&#xD;
As her husband's jealousy shut her out from society, she made&#xD;
a companion and confidant of me; and I grew up with her,&#xD;
much like a younger sister. She first. taught me the beauty of&#xD;
&#xD;
CONFESSIONS.                    868&#xD;
truth ; and her gentle words found always such sweet echoes in&#xD;
my heart, that I asked no greater privilege than to sit at her&#xD;
feet, with tears of tenderness in my eyes, and listen. She used&#xD;
to tell me that nobody in the world knew her, but me. I am sure&#xD;
there was no one else to whom she could talk of that which was&#xD;
nearest her heart. The little society she saw consisted of worldly&#xD;
and superficial people, with whom she could feel no sympathy.&#xD;
Her chief consolation, out of herself, was books, which I used to&#xD;
read to her. But the volumes she chose were different from those&#xD;
I read to Mrs. Beman. She took great delight in the Gospels;&#xD;
I used often to read a passage, then together we would- seek for&#xD;
its interior meaning. 0, Bertha ! how wonderful are all those&#xD;
. sayings of our Saviour ! I had read them before, without under-&#xD;
standing them. To Mrs. Graves I owed the .revelation of their&#xD;
spirit. The love, the wisdom, the beauty of that spirit, widened,&#xD;
and deepened, and brightened, day by day, as I studied under her&#xD;
instruction. Next to the Scriptures, there were a few books of&#xD;
essays and philosophy, that gratified her most. Then I read&#xD;
choice volumes of travels, history, poetry, and romance. So three&#xD;
~years passed. I was seventeen, when Richard, a nephew of Mr.&#xD;
Graves, came home from Germany, where he had been studying.&#xD;
He visited us often ; and I soon discovered a strong sympathy&#xD;
between him and his youthful aunt. She confessed to him her&#xD;
aspirations and her faith ; and, in return, he imparted to her the&#xD;
results of his philosophical studies, with reminiscences of his&#xD;
foreign tour. He was surprised to find that, with her own intui-&#xD;
tive perceptions, she had discerned truths which he had arrived at&#xD;
only with great labor. But, with all his learning, she became his&#xD;
teacher. Like me, he sat at her feet, and listened with tearful&#xD;
eyes. Sometimes she spoke like one inspired, putting all his&#xD;
philosophy aside; then she would ask his forgiveness, sweetly and&#xD;
humbly, telling, him that she knew nothing, and that it was not&#xD;
herself that spoke.&#xD;
"I was nearly always witness of their interviews. Sometimes&#xD;
Mr. Graves was present; then his wife would tell me gently that&#xD;
I could retire. If he went away, I was recalled. But this state&#xD;
of things could not continue. One evening, Mr. Graves came&#xD;

&#xD;
suddenly upon us, when we supposed him fifty miles away. In&#xD;
the morning he had given out word that he was going upon a&#xD;
journey, to be absent a couple of days.  He had remained in&#xD;
town to watch. When he entered, Richard was on the floor ;&#xD;
Mrs. Graves sat upon an ottoman, holding his head in her lap.&#xD;
The night was warm; the doors were all flung open; there was&#xD;
no light but the glimmer of the moon, which shone through the&#xD;
windows. The old man crept in like a cat.  I cannot describe&#xD;
the scene that ensued. Mrs. Graves, in her gentlest tones, called&#xD;
me to witness her innocence. Until that moment, he had not been&#xD;
aware of my presence. I hastened from the obscure corner where&#xD;
I sat ; but the sight of me appeared only to enrage him the more.&#xD;
He knew the confidence Mrs. Graves placed in me, and believed me&#xD;
a mere tool, that could be blind, deaf, and dumb, in her service,&#xD;
as occasion required. Richard was driven from the house. He&#xD;
would have set up a defence, but Mrs. Graves requested him to&#xD;
go. She was calm and resigned, and only said, in answer to her&#xD;
husband's charges, that he did his own soul injustice. Her inno-&#xD;
cence appeared a shield from which his shafts glanced off harm-&#xD;
less. Unfortunately, they struck me. Some sacrifice to his rage&#xD;
was- necessary. Richard had gone too quietly ; his wife was too&#xD;
patient under the stroke. To tear her heart, he resolved that I&#xD;
should go too. This was the third great blow of my life. But it&#xD;
fell more heavily upon me than either my father's death or the&#xD;
separation from my mother, because I'was now of an age to appre-&#xD;
ciate all my loss. Another such mistress did not exist on earth.&#xD;
I was once more a slave. I was young ; I was not without some&#xD;
personal attractions; I was at the mercy of whoever might pur-&#xD;
chase me. Once more I was sold.    The affair was concluded&#xD;
before even Mrs. Graves suspected the turn her husband's ven-&#xD;
geance had taken. ' I knew nothing of it until the morning I was&#xD;
carried away. At thannouncement of my fate, I fell down in&#xD;
a swoon. Ah, Bertha ! I can tell you nothing of the agony of&#xD;
that day ! "&#xD;
"But it is terrible," said Bertha, " to be subject to the caprices&#xD;
of a mean and revengeful old man ! His wife, could she do noth-&#xD;
ing for you?"&#xD;

atHow could she ?  Although her servant, I was his property,&#xD;
I was torn from her arms, and placed in a closecarriage, which&#xD;
bore me away from her forever. My new owner accompanied me&#xD;
He was a speculator, who had been for a few days at New Orleans&#xD;
transacting business with Mr. Graves. He was taking me to Mo-&#xD;
bile. I can only describe him as one of those smooth, pleasant&#xD;
men, with somethin indefinably bad and repulsive in their na-&#xD;
tures, from which *  shrink instinctively. He tried to cheer me,&#xD;
by telling me, gayly, that one good master was worth forty good&#xD;
mistresses, for a handsome young girl like me. We reached Mo-&#xD;
bile that afternoon.  His wife met us, on our arrival.  She was&#xD;
a passionate woman, with a certain plumpness and fairness about&#xD;
her, which passed with many for beauty.  But she looked any.&#xD;
thing but beautiful to me then. 'For heaven's sake, doctor!'&#xD;
she cried, ' what have you got there ?' ' Only a bit of a specula-&#xD;
tion,' said my new master, with a laugh. 'I bought her for seven&#xD;
hundred,' he added, in a low tone, 'and if I don't get twelve for&#xD;
her within asthany days, I '11 give her to you. You shall have&#xD;
that new shawl the day I get her off my hands.' Ah, Bertha !&#xD;
you never knew what it was to be the property of a base and&#xD;
selfish man ! No law to protect me ; no friend to whom I could&#xD;
appeal; no chance or hope of escape, -what could I do? He&#xD;
could not comprehend how a person in my condition should resist&#xD;
him; and they longer I evaded his pursuit, the more desperate and&#xD;
determined he became. At length, -it was after the lapse of&#xD;
several months, -there came a'change. 0, Bertha ! if I had the&#xD;
courage to draw the dark picture of those months ! - but let&#xD;
them pass !&#xD;
"Dr. Tanwood was frequently absent, on affairs of business or&#xD;
pleasure ; at which times his wife was in the habit of receiving&#xD;
visitors; who rarely came when he was supposed to be at home,&#xD;
I should tell you that, in the mean while, the twelve days having&#xD;
long since elapsed during -which I was to have been sold, he had&#xD;
gone through with the mockery of giving me to his wife. She&#xD;
was naturally an extravagant and luxurious woman, and the grat-&#xD;
ification of having me to dress her, and wait upon her, and fan&#xD;
her as she lolled upon her favorite lounge, had partly reconciled&#xD;

her to my presence. One day she sent me to say to a visitor, who&#xD;
was waiting in the parlor, that she would be with him in two min-&#xD;
utes,-which meant ten. As I entered, he looked at me strangely,&#xD;
as he had often done before, - for he had been frequently at the'&#xD;
house, - and as I was retiring, he called me back.  I asked him&#xD;
what he would' have.  'You can put away my hat,' said he. But,&#xD;
as I went to take it, he held it, and looked up in my face. ' What&#xD;
is your name ?'   ' Camille,' said I, -' people call me Milly.'&#xD;
' Camille,' said he, ' I am a northern man. There is something&#xD;
I would say to you, if I dared.' I was frightened by the wild&#xD;
thoughts that rushed through my brain.  'You understand me,'&#xD;
he said. 'Yes,' I answered ; ' and you may dare, to say any-&#xD;
thing !' ' Can you read ?' ' Yes.' ' And write?' 'Yes.' 'You&#xD;
have hard of the northern states ?' said he. ' The free states !'&#xD;
I answered. ' Good !' said he. 'There is no need of explana-&#xD;
tions. Go now. I will see you again.'&#xD;
"9I ran back trembling to my mistress. She was dressing, and&#xD;
scolded me for leaving her so long alone. I assisted her, scarce&#xD;
knowing what I did ; but I finished the task without exciting her&#xD;
suspicions, and she swept into the parlor.  Presently she sum-&#xD;
moned me, and called for water and glasses.  For Mr. Roberts,'&#xD;
said she, languidly, with a wave of her fan, as I reentered with a&#xD;
salver. Mr. Roberts took a glass and' handed it to her ; then&#xD;
taking one for himself, he dropped a little ball of paper upon the&#xD;
salver. You can imagine the eagerness with which 'I unrolled it,&#xD;
and examined its contents, the moment I was alone. There were&#xD;
four lines, written with a pencil, which I will repeat, if I have&#xD;
not forgotten them:&#xD;
'Would ye know how young Ellen deceived the old couple ?'&#xD;
In a swate little billet, directed to Pat,&#xD;
She wrote all her sorrow, her hopes, and her trouble,&#xD;
And pinned it one night in the crown of his hat.'&#xD;
"It was not easy to forget those lines, Bertha !  I thought I&#xD;
discovered in Mr. Roberts a generous and adventurous spirit, that&#xD;
might be of infinite service, if I would trust him. I stole pencil&#xD;
and paper from the doctor's office, and, carrying them to the gar-&#xD;

ret, wrote a hurried account of ' poor Ellen,' who, in the despair&#xD;
of her state, was ready to adopt any measures to escape from the&#xD;
tyranny of the aged couple.  Had the note actually fallen into&#xD;
my mistress' hands, I doubt if she would have understood it. I&#xD;
think she was not even aware that I could write.; But it did not&#xD;
fall into her hands. I secreted it in the lining of the visitor's&#xD;
hat, which I had previously placed upon the hall-table. Thus&#xD;
our correspondence began. When he came again, I found another&#xD;
communication where I had placed mine  It was in rhyme, which&#xD;
he appeared to have a talent for composing ; and in it I read, with&#xD;
trembling interest, the assurance that Patrick O'Rooney would&#xD;
devise speedy means for the deliverance of poor Ellen,&#xD;
aI had now strong hopes' of escaping from my precarious situa-&#xD;
tion. It was time. Irritated by my constant evasions, the doc-&#xD;
tor had threatened to sell me to a coarser and brutal man, whom&#xD;
he brought to the house to intimidate me. ' He has offered a&#xD;
thousand dollars for you,' said he, ' and if I 'can't tame -you, he&#xD;
shall. He' has no jealous wife' to stand in the way.' The menace&#xD;
served to accelerate the crisis. I found Mr. Roberts resolute and&#xD;
ingenious. Indeed, his extraordinary audacity alarmed me more&#xD;
than once. Sometimes he came twice the same day, bringing me&#xD;
messages in his hat.   I wondered how Mrs. Tanwood could&#xD;
avoid seeing that his visits were designed for me ; but she was&#xD;
infatuated, and believed that she had charmed him to that point.&#xD;
"On one occasion, he brought an acquaintance, whom he in-&#xD;
troduced to Mrs. Tanwood. Ah, Bertha ! it is with strange feel-&#xD;
ings that I recall the incidents of that night ! The acquaintance&#xD;
was H9Ton! How well I remembered him, when I saw him for&#xD;
the second' time atyour house, there on the hill!"&#xD;
" You had   seen him, then ! " exclaimed Bertha.    "Tell&#xD;
about it ! "&#xD;
"Indeed, there is not much to tell, I was. afraid of him, and&#xD;
wished him away. Mr. Roberts had been wise enough not to&#xD;
call his attention to me ; it seemed, however, when I net him at&#xD;
your house, that my features were fixed in his memory, and that&#xD;
I could not move or speak without danger of recognition. One&#xD;
incident I thought surely would recur to him, at sight of me.&#xD;

868                    CONFESSIONS.&#xD;
Mr. Roberts brought me a small bundle that night, which I had&#xD;
taken from his hat, and concealed in a barrel in the garret, dur-&#xD;
ing their visit. On going away, Hector observed his friend's hat,&#xD;
and spoke of this package. 'Do you take me for a lackey?' cried&#xD;
Mr. Roberts, with a laugh. 'You certainly had a package,' said&#xD;
Hector, 'for I remarked it both in the street and after we came&#xD;
in.' My mistress called me, to know what I had done with it.&#xD;
I am good for nothing when a sudden shock comes upon me, and&#xD;
coolness and self-possession are required to turn aside suspicion.&#xD;
I !trembled, and felt my cheek change color ; but before I had'&#xD;
time to reply, Mr. Roberts declared that it was a joke of his&#xD;
friend's; and I took advantage of the discussion which ensued,&#xD;
to escape from observation."&#xD;
" What was the package? " asked Bertha.&#xD;
"It contained articles destined for my disguise ; I had been&#xD;
unable to get them myself, and Mr. Roberts had engaged to pro-&#xD;
cure them for me. I need not tell you with what anxiety I now&#xD;
counted the days, and hours, and minutes. At last, 0, Bertha !&#xD;
at last the night of all nights in my life was at hand ! There&#xD;
was so much depending upon the secrecy of my movements, and&#xD;
such fatality might topple down, like an avalanche, at the touch&#xD;
of the slightest accident;that I prayed continually for the guidance&#xD;
of a power above my own.&#xD;
" For some weeks I had been accustomed to make my bed on&#xD;
the kitchen floor with the cook. She was no very pleasant com-&#xD;
panion ; she was decrepit and, cross; more than that, she affected&#xD;
tp despise and hate me, because I was white. She suspected, how-&#xD;
ever, the reasons why I preferred her company to sleeping in a&#xD;
room alone, and suffered me to occupy a corner of her dormitory.&#xD;
I spread out my bed that night, and, lying down as usual, pre&#xD;
tended sodn to be fast asleep.  She was in a grumbling mood,&#xD;
and talked in her worst style for over an hour; .but I made no&#xD;
reply; and at length, becoming weary of her muttered soliloquy,&#xD;
site turned over, and became silent. About an hour later, the&#xD;
doctor came home. The clock had just struck twelve. I heard&#xD;
hime enter softly, and take off his boots~ before going up stairs.&#xD;
He had reasons for not wishing to disturb his wife ; and, notwith-&#xD;
&#xD;
CONFESSIONS.                    869&#xD;
standing all that had passed, he still entertained hopes of finding&#xD;
me in the garret. I listened with a beating heart ; and, after a&#xD;
long silence, I heard his stealthy steps again on the stairs. He&#xD;
came to the kitchen, and spoke to me. It was dark, and I lay. still&#xD;
as death, hoping that he would go away; but there was nothing&#xD;
to prevent his entering the room, and he came in, on tiptoe. My&#xD;
only resource was to rouse old Juno, and I shook her arm; but&#xD;
her sleep was so heavy that 'I could not awaken her. The doctor&#xD;
attempted to take me from her, and for a week ,after I carried&#xD;
the mark of his hand upon my arm. The struggle awoke the&#xD;
cook; I was saved. After the doctor was gone, she lay down&#xD;
again in her corner, chuckling at his discomfiture. It was not&#xD;
long before she was again asleep, and all was still in the house.&#xD;
My great fear then was that he would return; I lay listening for&#xD;
hours. At three o'clock, hearing no sound, I got up, and stole&#xD;
softly from the kitchen. His office was on the same floor. His&#xD;
wife's apartments and the parlor were on the floor above. I had&#xD;
to pass these to arrive at the garret ; but first I took the precau-&#xD;
tion to open the street door. After waiting some time to ascertain&#xD;
that no one was disturbed, I ascended the stairs, pausing and&#xD;
listening at every step.&#xD;
"Well, I reached the garret, and all was still. I then groped&#xD;
my waf to the barrel, where I had concealed my disguise, together&#xD;
with a candle, necessary in making my toilet. I struck a light,&#xD;
and proceeded to adjust my costume before ,a fragment of glass&#xD;
stuck against the wall. I had an old and faded _merino dress,&#xD;
which I had arranged for the occasion. The articles Mr. Roberts&#xD;
brought me I had prepared by stealth, and they were all ready to&#xD;
put on. There was a wig of gray hair, and old-fashioned specta-&#xD;
cles, with colored glasses ; in addition to which, I had an old&#xD;
woman's cap, and-a bonnet that shaded my face. The most diffi-&#xD;
cult thing of all was to color my complexion, to give it that&#xD;
wrinkled appearance characteristic of old age. But this I had&#xD;
already done once before, to give Mrs. Graves an evening's enter-&#xD;
tainment; and had, at that time, succeeded so well, even in&#xD;
deceiving the members of the house, that I felt confidence in adopt-~&#xD;
ing the disguise for a more serious adventure.&#xD;

870                    CONFESSIONS.&#xD;
" At length all was arranged ; and, looking in the glass, I was&#xD;
half frightened at the image that met my view. It was no longer&#xD;
myself; but a veritable old woman. So far, all was well;' but, 0,&#xD;
Bertha, so much yet remained to be done ! I had first to descend&#xD;
the stairs, with a small bundle of clothes in one hand, and my,&#xD;
shoes in the other, pausing and listening at every step, as before.&#xD;
But I will not dwell upon that ; you can imagine my feelings, at&#xD;
such a time. I succeeded in passing the hall,- then how glad I&#xD;
was that I. had taken the precaution to leave the door ajar! I&#xD;
glided into the street, and put on my shoes. The city lay around&#xD;
me, like a wilderness, so silent and deserted that the sound of my&#xD;
own footsteps startled me. The stars were just beginning to wane&#xD;
before the light of day. On the corner, where I expected to meet&#xD;
my friend and guide, I encountered three or four intoxicated men,&#xD;
who accosted me, and refused to let me pass, until I had answered&#xD;
their tipsy questions. I dared not cry for help ; for I knew not&#xD;
which most to fear, them, or the city watchmen. Fortunately, at&#xD;
this crisis, Mr. Roberts appeared, and rescued me from their&#xD;
hands, I got away, and hastened along the street. In a little&#xD;
while he rejoined me; then first I felt that I was safe ; but he had&#xD;
bed news to tell me, which left me little time to rejoice. He had&#xD;
engaged the captain of a merchant ship, whom he had interested&#xD;
in my behalf, to carry me to New York. His vessel lay down the&#xD;
bay, and he was to send a boat at daybreak, to take me on board.&#xD;
The evening previous, however, he had sent word, at a late hour,&#xD;
that the day of sailing was postponed, --which Mr. Roberts had&#xD;
not received in season to communicate to me. But he told me-&#xD;
not to be discouraged. ' Of course,' said he, 'you are not anxious&#xD;
to go back.' Go back! II did not know what would tempt me to&#xD;
go through again what I had that night suffered ! ' Well,' said&#xD;
le, ' the sooner you are out of the city, the better. There are&#xD;
oyster-boats going down the river at all hours of the morning, and&#xD;
I see no reason why one of them cannot be engaged to put you on&#xD;
board' the Manhattan.' We reached the river, and, walking along&#xD;
the wharves, found two men preparing to push off. My companion&#xD;
addressed them; but he did not like their appearance; and, for&#xD;
my part, I was afraid to trust myself alone in their charge.",&#xD;
&#xD;
CONFESSIONS.                    871&#xD;
" Mr. Roberts was not going with you, then ?" said Bertha.&#xD;
" 0, no; - but I will tell you about that. Near by, we saw&#xD;
an old man and a toy, also on the point of setting out for the&#xD;
oyster-banks; and Mr. Roberts proceeded to make a bargain for my&#xD;
passage. 'She is a-poor old woman,' said he, ' whose son has run&#xD;
away, and she wants to catch him before he sails.'- The regret,&#xD;
anxiety, joy, - 0, Bertha ! you can imagine what I felt as I took&#xD;
leave of him, and stepped into the boat. He remained standing&#xD;
upon the wharf; the old man pushed off; a light wind filled the&#xD;
sail, and in a few moments the only friend I then had in the wide&#xD;
world was lost to sight.&#xD;
" The sun was near two hours' high when we approached the&#xD;
Fleet, as it is called; and the old man pointed out to me the Man-&#xD;
hattan, riding at anchor in the bay. We had a good breeze; and&#xD;
in a little while we sailed alongside. My heart stood still when&#xD;
the old man hailed for the captain. The reply came that he was&#xD;
ashore, and would not come on board until ten o'clock. I was&#xD;
greatly alarmed at this ; but, fortunately, I was recognized by the&#xD;
mate, who was in the secret, and received on board. The old man&#xD;
and his son were sent away, and I was conducted to the state-&#xD;
room secured for me. 0, when the door was shut, and I was&#xD;
alone, - and safe,-0, Bertha, how my full heart overflowed in&#xD;
prayers and tears ! I lay down in my berth ; and I was so&#xD;
exhausted and weary that I soon fell asleep. A rap at my door&#xD;
awakened me. I was foolish enough to be frightened, imagining&#xD;
that my master had come ; but presently I summoned courage,&#xD;
and turned back -the bolt. A bronzed; bright, benevolent face&#xD;
looked in upon me; it was the captain, whom I knew at once as a&#xD;
friend. He assured me that the vessel would sail on the following&#xD;
day, and, on hearing my story, offered to bet heavy sums that no-&#xD;
body would think of looking for me on board his ship.&#xD;
"4I was more grateful than my words could express. The day&#xD;
and night di-agged slowly, but, 0, I was patient, Bertha, and my&#xD;
heart was full of a new joy. I was free ! At last the time of&#xD;
sailing arrived ; what, then, was my surprise, on receiving a visit&#xD;
from Mr. Roberts! I was still more~ surprised to learn that he&#xD;
had come on board with his .baggage, resolved upon making the&#xD;

voyage with me ! Then, Bertha, I began to have a clearer insight&#xD;
into the heart of that man. He had intended going with me, from&#xD;
the first."&#xD;
"«Why had he deceived you?"&#xD;
" Before my escape, he had expressed, in one of his notes,&#xD;
sentiments which I disliked ; and I had replied that if such were&#xD;
his motives in assisting me, I must decline those services which&#xD;
I could not repay in the manner he seemed to anticipate. He&#xD;
was not a man I could ever regard otherwise than as a friend,&#xD;
and I told him so. He denied the motives I imputed to him ;&#xD;
but, Bertha, when we met on board the ship, I could no longer&#xD;
shut my ears against a truth which had been whispered to me con-&#xD;
tinually. I had charged my heart with ingratitude and injustice,&#xD;
and refused to believe what it said. Now, however, it was but too&#xD;
plainly revealed. Selfishness was the mainspring of his conduct,&#xD;
and all that he had done for me was marred.&#xD;
"tOnce at sea, I abandoned roy disguise, and often appeared&#xD;
upon deck with no other attempt at concealment than a simple&#xD;
veil thrown over any face. When off the coast of Florida, we had&#xD;
fine breezes, the sea was surpassingly beautiful, and the sky was&#xD;
of a clear, deep, heavenly blue, which filled my soul with wonder&#xD;
and joy. There was but one cloud above my horizon. It ap-&#xD;
peared in the form of Mr. Roberts. One day, to escape him, I&#xD;
retreated to my room; but he followed me, and, by an unworthy&#xD;
stratagem, succeeded in gaining admittance. We were the only&#xD;
passengers, and the sole occupants of the cabin at the time ; and&#xD;
T Was in his power. As an excuse for his violence, he had the base-&#xD;
ness to remind me of what I owed to him, and to charge me with&#xD;
ingratitude. '*It is true,' said I, ' I owe you my liberty, and in.&#xD;
return I will give you my life,'- I said this despairingly, for I&#xD;
was ready to die. He declared impetuously that I was wrong to&#xD;
speak so ; for it was only my love he sought. ' But,' said I,&#xD;
'your approach will kill me! I give you that warning.'&#xD;
"I no longer held him from me ; but, as he caught me in his&#xD;
arms, he felt a hard substance strike him. Starting asiIe, he&#xD;
caught the glimpse of a knife-handle, and thought I had stabbed&#xD;

him ; but, as he released me, I fell back; and then he saw that&#xD;
the blade was in my own breast."&#xD;
" Yov had stabbed yourself ! "&#xD;
"No, Bertha. But I had placed the knife between us. It was&#xD;
one I had borrowed of the captain on some pretence ; the blade&#xD;
was broad and sharp ; but, fortunately, the point had become&#xD;
entangled in my handkerchief, in which I held it concealed. I&#xD;
suffered from a deathly faintness; but I did not quite lose my&#xD;
consciousness at any moment : I placed my handkerchief upon the&#xD;
wound, to stop the blood, and entreated Mr. Roberts, with all-my&#xD;
remaining force, to have mercy upon me, and leave me. Over-&#xD;
come with horror and remorse, he fell upon his knees, and prayed&#xD;
to be forgiven, and to be permitted to atone for his wrong. He&#xD;
hastened to bring me linen from his trunk; but I locked the door,&#xD;
and would not let him return. Afterwards, when I was stronger,&#xD;
I washed and dressed the ,wound myself, and left nature to do the&#xD;
rest. I appealed to the captain for protection, and found in him&#xD;
a genuine, hearty friend. As the voyage approached its termina-&#xD;
tion, he asked me what I proposed to" do on my arrival at New&#xD;
York. I showed him a letter which Mr. Roberts had previously&#xD;
given me to a person in that city, who, he said,,would assist me&#xD;
in reaching Canada. ' But, since he is with me,' said I, ' I no&#xD;
longer know what to do.'&#xD;
" How well he managed, you will know, when I tell you that,&#xD;
on arriving'at New York, I was taken secretly from his ship, at&#xD;
night, and placed on board a sloop, bound up the North River,&#xD;
He had, by chance, met a skipper of his acquaintance, who was to&#xD;
sail with the first wind, and who promised to land me in Albany,&#xD;
free of expense.- How fortune Seemed to favor me, Bertha ! I&#xD;
was on my way to Canada, before Mr. Roberts knew I had left&#xD;
the ship.&#xD;
" As I was travelling alone, I had followed Captain Damon's&#xD;
prudent counsel, and resumed my disguise. ' An old woman,' he&#xD;
said, ' will get along much better among a certain class of people&#xD;
than a young girl.' I had had experience enough to believe him.&#xD;
He put into my hands a letter for a brother of his at Whitehall,&#xD;
which he said was directly on my route, assuring me that, on its&#xD;

delivery, I would find a friend to forward me safely upon my&#xD;
journey. Two days after quitting the Manhattan, I was landed&#xD;
at Albany, as the skipper had promised. ,But he did not leave&#xD;
me until he had placed me on board a boat bound for Whitehall,&#xD;
and made a bargain for my passage, which I paid with money&#xD;
Captain Damon had given me for the purpose. Thus far I&#xD;
had played my part so well that no person, not even the skipper,&#xD;
suspected that my age was less than three score."&#xD;
"I cannot' conceive how you could do it ! " said Bertha.&#xD;
" It was not so difficult as you imagine. People do not scru-&#xD;
tinize old women. I pretended to have a catarrh, which obliged&#xD;
me to wear my bonnet ; then I dressed to disguise my form, and&#xD;
wore old gloves upon my hands. I experienced more difficulty in&#xD;
managing the tones of my voice than in all the rest. But I have&#xD;
a. respectable talent at mimicry, and succeeded even in that;&#xD;
although, I fancy, people must have thought me exceedingly quiet&#xD;
for an old lady. Few, I think, ever felt less ambition to talk-!&#xD;
"Everything happened favorably until my arrival at Whitehall,&#xD;
when, to my consternation, I learned that Captain Damon's&#xD;
brother had removed into the country, on account of ill-health.&#xD;
As I had no means of getting to Canada without assistance, I&#xD;
obtained his 'address, and set out on foot, the same evening, to&#xD;
find him.&#xD;
" I had not gone far before I ascertained that the distance was&#xD;
much greater than I had suspected. I walked four miles that&#xD;
night, and stopped to rest at a farm-house. I was allowed to&#xD;
sleep in the barn, and invited to breakfast on the following&#xD;
morning. I had no appetite ; but, to guard against future&#xD;
hunger, I forced myself to eat a morsel, and, thanking them&#xD;
hastily, took my leave. This house proved to be that of Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood's brother-in-law, in Sawney Hook ; it was there I first&#xD;
made the acquaintance of grandmother Rigglesty.&#xD;
"I was now among the mountains, in the midst of new and&#xD;
surprising scenery. I walked far, in the cool of the day; when I&#xD;
became tired, I sat down on the roadside, and listened to the&#xD;
singing of the birds. I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed that&#xD;
morning ! Hope and freedom inspired me ; but hope and free-&#xD;
&#xD;
CONFESSIONS.                   375&#xD;
dom did not prevent my becoming faint and weary, long before&#xD;
noon. But, as I was fast approaching the house I was in search&#xD;
of, I kept on, and arrived in sight of it at about one o'clock. I&#xD;
was alarmed to find a number of carriages at the fence, and a&#xD;
group of solemn people near the door. Presently a coifln was&#xD;
brought out, and placed in a wagon; then the people began to get&#xD;
into their carriages, and a procession was formed.&#xD;
"I sat down upon a stone by the road, and waited for the&#xD;
funeral to pass. Presently two men came out on foot, and stopped&#xD;
to talk near the place where I sat. I inquired if that was Mr.&#xD;
Damon's house.&#xD;
"'That was Charles Damon's house,' one of them replied, ' but&#xD;
he has moved.' I was so disturbed at this that I could scarcely&#xD;
speak, to ask where he had gone. 'He has just gone down the&#xD;
road,' the man said. ' You will find his new house in the grave-&#xD;
yard just over the hill. It is a house of but one story, and that&#xD;
is built under ground.&#xD;
"I was trying to collect my thoughts, and wondering what I&#xD;
should do, when the men began to discuss an item of news which&#xD;
frightened me so much that I quite forgot the funeral. They&#xD;
spoke of the fugitive-slave law, and of some slave-hunters, who, as&#xD;
I understood them, had recently arrived in town. ' For my part,'&#xD;
said one, 'I hope they will put the law in force, and carry back&#xD;
every fugitive this side of Canada. I'll help them, if I 'm called&#xD;
upon.' I waited until the men went away; then, rising to my&#xD;
feet, set out to walk as fast as I could down the road. I after-&#xD;
wards learned that the slave-hunters alluded to were probably&#xD;
some who abort that time visited a town in the State of New&#xD;
York ; but, in my panic, I imagined them in full pursuit of me.&#xD;
I took by-roads, and travelled on and on, keeping a northerly&#xD;
direction, but with no definite purpose in view, until I found&#xD;
myself on a wild mountain-side, and the path I had followed&#xD;
became lost ii a gloomy forest. My courage failed. I had eaten&#xD;
nothing since morning, and there was danger of perishing in the&#xD;
woods. But, looking off uapon the valley, I saw houses and farms,&#xD;
and, weary as I was, I began to descend the mountain. I crossed&#xD;
a steep pasture-land, fullof rocks and thistles, among which I&#xD;

876                    CONFESSIONS.&#xD;
slipped and fell, until I was so overcome with pain and exhaus-&#xD;
tion that sometimes I could scarce rise again to my feet. But&#xD;
the valley lay before, and it seemed to me that on reaching the&#xD;
meadows I would find liss difficulty in proceeding, they looked so&#xD;
smooth, and green, and cool ! I drank at a clear brool, that&#xD;
leaped plashing and singing along the mountain-side; and, feeling&#xD;
slightly rested and  refreshed, kept on down the slope. On&#xD;
reaching the low land, however, I found the grass an unexpected&#xD;
obstacle; and as I proceeded it became ranker, deeper, and&#xD;
thicker, at every step, until I sank down in utter helplessness and&#xD;
despair., But night was setting in, a storm was gathering and&#xD;
blackening, and I made a final effort to reach an old. barn that&#xD;
stood not far off in the valley. I came to a stream hedged with&#xD;
willows and vines, and, as.I was searching for an opening in the&#xD;
bushes, I discovered a bridge. I had hardly -crossed, when a&#xD;
dizziness seized me, and I fainted, within a dozen yards of the&#xD;
barn.  On recovering my consciousness, I heard a shout, and&#xD;
exerted myself to answer it. It was Mr. Jackwood calling Abim-&#xD;
elech, who was lost in the meadow.&#xD;
" I feel too weak, Bertha," said Camille, for so we now must&#xD;
call her, " to tell you more to-day. I have made a long and&#xD;
tedious story. But another time you shall hear more of Mr.&#xD;
Roberts -"&#xD;
"And Hector," said Bertha, -" how were you married ?  He&#xD;
had left you once !"&#xD;
" Yes, when I told him   my history.  But his love," said&#xD;
Camille, with a glorious smile, " his love was great as his soul!&#xD;
He came back, and claimed me as his wife."&#xD;
Bertha covered her face.  " Happy, happy wife ! God bless&#xD;
you!" and she sobbed upon Camille's bosom.&#xD;
&#xD;
XLII.&#xD;
THE WILDERNESS.&#xD;
I KNow not what discontent gnawed Mr. Dunbury's heart. If&#xD;
the same that tortured him during his illness, and before the loss&#xD;
of Camille, it had since become intensified to an insupportable&#xD;
degree. By day his brow    lowered with fiercest gloom. By&#xD;
night he groaned and gnashed his teeth in sleep. "0, God ! 0,&#xD;
God ! 0, God ! " he would sometimes cry out, in his anguish.&#xD;
His invalid wife was witness to these outbursts.  Although&#xD;
lying almost at the brink of the grave, - although her soul, hov-&#xD;
ering 'twixt life and death, seemed only to linger that it might&#xD;
pray for those she loved until the end, -her heart was moved&#xD;
with compassion for her husband; and, to quench the fires of his&#xD;
remorse, to soothe and soften him, she would have imparted to&#xD;
him the secret of Camille's rescue. But only once had she the&#xD;
power to approach the subject -to mention Camille's name. He&#xD;
tore himself fiercely from her. " Away ! " he cried. " The fires&#xD;
of hell are in me !"&#xD;
One day he heard the vague rumor of a drowned body being&#xD;
discovered, some miles below, at a place that had been flooded by&#xD;
the recent freshet. Although scarce able as yet to ride, he&#xD;
mounted his horse, and spurred with speed ,to the scene of the&#xD;
excitement. The rumor proved well-founded. A' frozen corpse&#xD;
had been brought in from the interval. But it was the corpse&#xD;
of a man. Mr. Dunbury recognized the lunatic, Edward Long-&#xD;
man.&#xD;
The friends of the deceased were advised of the event. Mr.&#xD;
Longman and his daughter-in-law came from Canada;! and the&#xD;
funeral was attended in Mr. Dunbury's house.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC8115-00000190"/>&#xD;
878                  THE WILDERNE$ .&#xD;
In the midst of the ceremony, a rider arrived upon a reeking&#xD;
and foaming horse, and, flinging himself down at the gate,&#xD;
appeared abruptly before the ,astonished company. "Hector !"&#xD;
articulated Mrs. Dunbury, reaching out her arms.&#xD;
He was pale and stern of look. He heeded her not. He&#xD;
strode to the coffin; he gazed on the face of the dead. The&#xD;
invalid, feeble as she was, rose up, white and ghost-like, from her&#xD;
couch, and tottered to his side !  "My son ! Hector! speak to me !&#xD;
This is poor Edward, who was drowned. Charlotte ...."&#xD;
" Ay,- where is she ?" said Hector's hollow voice. He turned&#xD;
upon his father: his look was terrible. "At your hands I&#xD;
demand my wife !"&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury stood speechless; the relations looking on with&#xD;
consternation. Still the invalid clung to Hector, whose soul&#xD;
knew her not. The clergyman, a mild and formal man, stepped&#xD;
forward.&#xD;
"Have respect for the dead ! "&#xD;
"'T is not my dead !" said Hector. " At your hands, sir," he&#xD;
repeated, standing before his father, " I demand my wife !"&#xD;
" I do not know her !"- broke forth Mr. Dunbury.&#xD;
" You DID NOT know her ! " answered Hector.  "And it were&#xD;
better for your soul had your eyes never beheld her ! The dove&#xD;
to whom you refused shelter, the lamb you drove out to the&#xD;
wolves   my wife, whom your cruelty killed - I require her life&#xD;
at your hands ! "&#xD;
"This -  this is strange language to address to me, sir!"&#xD;
gasped the father.&#xD;
"It Is strange language ! Would to God I had never lived to&#xD;
speak 'it, or you to hear it ! 0, were you NOT my father ! "&#xD;
" My son ! my child !" uttered the invalid, "listen a moment,&#xD;
I beseech you! Charlotte -you have not heard all -you have&#xD;
not heard aright -"&#xD;
"I have heard ! My father - MY FATHER - thrust her forth!&#xD;
It is the village talk. With his curse she went ! Her blood is&#xD;
upon his hands! My wife.! my wife ! my wife !  0, God! con-.&#xD;
trol my soul ! "&#xD;
Covering his face, he rushed from the room, his mother crying&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WILDERNESS                    379&#xD;
out to him, and clasping his neck. Still he knew her not, or&#xD;
heard not, or heeded not. But, at one thrilling word her tongue&#xD;
pronounced, he started, and gazed at her.&#xD;
"Mother ! did you say -&#xD;
" Lives ! " she exclaimed, with exalted emotion.&#xD;
"Lives! Charlotte! is it true?"--&#xD;
" My son, it is heavenly true !"&#xD;
"iWhere ? speak at once!"   As soon as she could gather&#xD;
breath, the invalid told the tale. " 0, mother ! " said Hector,&#xD;
with bursting joy, "the word is worth a hundred thousand&#xD;
worlds ! She lives!"&#xD;
He sprang from her arms; he leaped upon his horse, and rode&#xD;
northward with furious speed. When once more he drew rein&#xD;
and flung- himself from the saddle, it was at the door of Mr.&#xD;
Rukely's house.&#xD;
A beautiful snow-storm speckled the heavens, and whitened&#xD;
all the ground. At the window of her room sat Camille, gazing&#xD;
out upon the wondrous phenomenon of the northern winter.&#xD;
Slowly, steadily, and one by one, the white flakes came fluttering&#xD;
down ; each falling and settling softly in its place, forming one&#xD;
vast white robe of ermine for the earth. And she was thinking&#xD;
how insignificant in ,itself seemed each feathery speck, yet how&#xD;
necessary all to complete nature's fair device, and fulfil her wise&#xD;
design. One went to ridge the rails of the olden fence; another&#xD;
was lost in the infinity of the fields; another joined the busy&#xD;
swarm that clustered on limb, and branch, and smallest quiv-&#xD;
ering twig, of the apple-tree ; another fell by the kitchen, and was&#xD;
trodden under foot. She called the snow HUMANITY, and looked&#xD;
up in the cloud to find a representation of herself. She chose, by&#xD;
chance, one minute speck from among the millions that darkened&#xD;
the air ; watched its slow increase, as it approached the earth;&#xD;
saw it assume the spangled angles of a fair light flake, and sink&#xD;
gently, steadily - into the well ! She was wondering what it&#xD;
meant ; whether the well was death, or the bosom and source of&#xD;
all humanity, or the heart of one, when the door. of the chainber&#xD;
was thrown suddenly open, and Bertha rushed in. Her speech&#xD;
&#xD;

880                 THE WILDERNESS.      -&#xD;
was incoherent; but her looks, her confused, hurried words, were&#xD;
but too full of meaning..&#xD;
" I don't know who it can be !" said Bertha. "I heard the&#xD;
bell ring ; I listened - mother was at the door - a voice&#xD;
demanded you!"&#xD;
"Perhaps," faltered Camille's pale lips, "perhaps it is a&#xD;
friend ! 0, if it were - Hector ! "&#xD;
" I will know!" exclaimed Bertha, agitated betwixt hope and&#xD;
fear.  Camille listened, as Bertha disappeared ; heard eager&#xD;
voices approaching presently, and a man's tread on the stairs.&#xD;
The door opened again. Bertha flew in. She was followed by -&#xD;
Robert Greenwich !.&#xD;
Marble cold with despair, Camille sank down upon the pillows&#xD;
of the arm-chair, fixing her icy looks upon the comer.&#xD;
"iYou are discovered ! " uttered Bertha. " He has come to&#xD;
warn you - to save you ! "&#xD;
" HE ! " repeated Camille, with a shudder.&#xD;
" Even I!" said Robert, with looks intense and. haggard.&#xD;
" For God's sake, waste not a moment or a word ! I thought&#xD;
you dead. In that thought I have suffered more than death !&#xD;
- a thousand deaths ! Believe me, for your own sake ! I am'&#xD;
in the confidence of the southern agents ; they are on your track ;&#xD;
I have but five minutes the start of them. In five minutes it&#xD;
will be too late !"&#xD;
" 0, Camille !" said Bertha, " why do you doubt ! Surely, he&#xD;
is your friend !"&#xD;
"If I have an enemy in the whole world," said Camille, " it is&#xD;
he ! He stands in my sight for all that is false and black in&#xD;
humanity ! "                                             -&#xD;
"How??-0, no.-" began Bertha.&#xD;
"I told you of Mr. Roberts,".interposed Camille, firm in her&#xD;
very despair. " I told you not half! Mr. Roberts and Robert&#xD;
Greenwich are the same. Tell me, is he to be trusted?"&#xD;
Bertha was struck dumb with this announcement.&#xD;
" Do not make me worse than I am! " said Robert ; " for, as&#xD;
I have wronged you, all I live for now is to make atonement.&#xD;
Your refusal will be to your own ruin, and to my eternal despair.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WILDERNESS.                   881&#xD;
I have a swift horse at the door; I can take you to a place of&#xD;
safety. If you are found here, nothing can save you! No&#xD;
money, no influence, no law -"&#xD;
"Tell us," cried Bertha, "how she has been discovered."&#xD;
"By a bribe. Dickson fell in with Mr. Crumlett, --"&#xD;
"0, Matilda !" Bertha cried out, " it is what I feared ! "&#xD;
"Since you required proof," said Robert, "I have betrayed the&#xD;
betrayer. How can you doubt ?"&#xD;
"I do not doubt," answered Camille, faintly. " But I will stay,&#xD;
and meet my fate."&#xD;
"Think of Hector ! " pleaded Bertha.&#xD;
" 0, Hector !"- Camille's strength gave way; she wrung her&#xD;
hands.- "But what can I do?"&#xD;
"Escape !"  And Bertha began hurriedly to wrap her in tip-&#xD;
pets and shawls. "I know that you can trust him; I know that&#xD;
he is sincere. -0, if Mr. Rukely would come ! "&#xD;
"Do with me as you will!   My mi       weak as my frame !&#xD;
But - do you go with me, Bertha ! "&#xD;
"Be sure I will stay by you."&#xD;
"0, sir !" and Camille turned her despairing eyes on Robert,&#xD;
"if it is in your heart to deceive me now, do but look upon me-&#xD;
consider what you do ! "&#xD;
He looked upon her, - so pale, so frail and helpless ; and if&#xD;
there was treachery in his heart, and had that heart been anything&#xD;
but stone, it must have relented then. ,But neither by word nor&#xD;
look did he evince any but the sincerest emotions. There was a&#xD;
Bible on the stand ; he seized it, and took oath thereupon to be&#xD;
henceforth truth itself, in all his dealings with her whom he had&#xD;
so wronged. He wished to carry Camille down stairs in his arms.&#xD;
But she would not suffer him. With the help of Bertha and Mrs.&#xD;
Wing, she reached the door.  "And you, Bertha?"&#xD;
"I had forgotten!" said Bertha.&#xD;
"A moment's delay may ruin all!" said Robert.&#xD;
Bertha ran for ie bonnet and- cloak. -Camille bad suffered&#xD;
herself to be placed in the cutter, and wrapped in its robes. Rob-&#xD;
ert leaped in. Bertha did not appear.&#xD;

cry; she turned her feeble head, and looked back imploringly:&#xD;
there stood the wondering old lady; then Bertha ran hurriedly&#xD;
from the house. It was, too late. The gate was passed; the&#xD;
cutter flew over the ground; and the white storm settled down'&#xD;
between Camille and the only haven of safety she knew in the&#xD;
wide world.&#xD;
A rash and hasty step; in avoiding an uncertain danger, to&#xD;
rush into the very face of a certain one-! So thought Bertha,&#xD;
after Camille was gone. And Bertha, wild with excitement, ac-&#xD;
cused herself as of some unpardonable crime. In her agitation&#xD;
she ran out to find Matilda, who had gone to do an errand in the&#xD;
village.  She met Miss Fosdick hurrying home through the&#xD;
storm.&#xD;
"What is it?" cried Matilda. "I 'm sure as I ever was of&#xD;
anything in my life that Charlotte Woods was in the cutter that&#xD;
just passed!"&#xD;
"She was!." uttered Bertha. "And you -you -Matilda-&#xD;
why did you tell that she was here?"&#xD;
" I, tell!" echoed Matilda. "I never did ! I hope to die! I&#xD;
never lisped it to a soul! "&#xD;
" True, Matilda?-never to any one ? "&#xD;
"Never! sure as I live!"&#xD;
"Not even to Enos?"&#xD;
"Did n't I tell you I wouldn't?"  But Matilda's voice fal-&#xD;
tered, and she looked troubled.&#xD;
" 0, then," said Bertha, "we have been deceived! Robert&#xD;
guessed where she was, and made up the story. Run for Mr.&#xD;
Rukely-! He is at the conference. Make haste, Matilda !"&#xD;
"Why," cried Miss Fosdick, "who said I told Enos Orumlett?&#xD;
I can't think that I ever breathed a syllable to him about it; and&#xD;
if I had, he would n't gone and told."&#xD;
Bertha hurried back to the house, in greater trouble than be-&#xD;
fore, believing that she had been duped by Robert's confident air&#xD;
and protestations of friendship; and that, through her, Camille&#xD;
had been betrayed. A sudden change was given to the current&#xD;
of her thoughts, however, when, arriving at the house, she found&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WILDERNESS.                    888&#xD;
the southern agents there before her; the doors flung wide; the&#xD;
old lady frightened; and Dickson furious at discovering that&#xD;
once more the bird had flown.&#xD;
Beyond the village, Robert pursued an unfrequented road, and,&#xD;
turning into a forest, followed a winding, irregular track, among&#xD;
the trees.&#xD;
"Where are you taking me?" implored Camille.&#xD;
"To the only spot I know where you can spend the night in&#xD;
safety," answered Robert. In safety ! The word sounded hollow&#xD;
as mockery in her ear ; - as if there could be safety for her any-&#xD;
where, with him !&#xD;
He drove on. The woods stood strangely still in the storm;&#xD;
there seemed no motion but the falling of the snowy cloud, no&#xD;
sound save that of hoofs and runners among the dark columns of&#xD;
the forest. The road was one that had been beaten by wood-cut-&#xD;
ters; it was rough and uneven; and Robert, who found it neces-&#xD;
sary to proceed slowly, occupied the time in endeavoring to ress-&#xD;
sure Camille. That he had suffered pangs of remorse on her&#xD;
account, she could not doubt; but, knowing him to be a slave to&#xD;
selfishness and passion, not one spark of genuine faith or hope&#xD;
could she draw from his most earnest vows. As they penetrated&#xD;
further and further t e gloom of the woods, deeper and darker&#xD;
became her despair. " 0, Hector ! Hector !" called her soul, in&#xD;
its helplessness; " cone to me! come to me!"&#xD;
At length they tur ed into a path so narrow that the cutter&#xD;
touched the bushes og each side, as they passed. They were in&#xD;
the midst of a thicket that had overgrown an ancient clearing.&#xD;
"Here," said Robert, " we are beyond pursuit."&#xD;
"What is here? " uttered the shuddering fugitive.&#xD;
" A refuge - a home - a protector ! "-i- and Robert pointed&#xD;
out a fog-hut, which appeared suddenly to view, as they turned a&#xD;
point in the tapgled wild. It was a dismal spot; the hut had a&#xD;
dreary, ruined, uninhabited aspect; the gloom, the storm, the sav-&#xD;
age loneliness of the wood, which. Camille's eye beheld on every&#xD;
side, added terrors to her situation. She had resolved in her&#xD;
heart not to leave the cutter, unless dragged from it by force;&#xD;
when, to her astonishment, Robert, leaping upon the ground&#xD;

884                 THE WILDERNESS.&#xD;
knocked three times upon the door. After some delay, it was&#xD;
slowly opened, and a chubby female face appeared, accompanied&#xD;
by an uncovered head, and a short, plump figure, -carelessly&#xD;
attired.&#xD;
"Why ! is it you?  Who have you got with you?"   The face&#xD;
struck Camille peculiarly; she had' seen it somewhere; and, at&#xD;
the sound of the voice, a flood of. recollections rushed over her.&#xD;
--- " Dear me ! Miss Woods !"&#xD;
"I had forgotten that you were old friends," said Robert. "So.&#xD;
much the better."&#xD;
" Does my husband know ?"- and the chubby face turned to&#xD;
Robert with a look of trepidation.&#xD;
" There was no time to consult him," said Robert.&#xD;
" I'm afraid he won't like it- r -it is so sudden ! "-and, turn.&#xD;
ing to Camille again, the chubby face tried to smile. " This is a&#xD;
surprise, is n't it? How do you do? How have you been ? Are&#xD;
you pretty well ?  Has your health been good since - it is quite&#xD;
unexpected, finding me in such a place, is n't it? Who ever&#xD;
thought you would visit me?  How well you are looking ! "&#xD;
"She is just up from a sick bed," said Robert. "Make- way,&#xD;
and place a chair."&#xD;
" Why, is she ill ? " cried the excited little woman.  "Who&#xD;
would have thought?  How feeble you do look ! Excuse appear-&#xD;
ances; we are,-my husband has a fancy for rural spots,-- we're&#xD;
here only temporarily, you know. How did you leave Canada?"&#xD;
The interior of the hut was in keeping with the exterior; the&#xD;
walls were of plastered logs, the floor of rough plank, the furni-&#xD;
ture scanty and rude. But a blazing fire in the chimney cast a&#xD;
glow of comfort upon the scene; and the chubby little woman&#xD;
hastened to place an old-fashioned arm-chair before the hearth for.&#xD;
Camille. Having seen his companion seated, Robert went out to&#xD;
take care of his horse. The door was shut and fastened.. Then&#xD;
Camille held eagerly upon the arm of the duchess, who was re-&#xD;
moving her things.&#xD;
" Dear Mrs. Sperkley '! " said she, 'I think you are my friend!&#xD;
Explain this to me ! It seems so strange that I should be brought&#xD;
here, - that I should find you! "&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WILDERNESS.                   885&#xD;
" Bless me! " cried the duchess, "you know more about it than&#xD;
I do ! I never was so astonished in my life ! Is 't an elopement ?&#xD;
Excuse me. I mean, are you married?"&#xD;
4 You have not heard, then, that I have been pursued -&#xD;
hunted -- "&#xD;
" Heavens, no ! How ? when ? where ? Have you passed - any&#xD;
of-it?"&#xD;
"Have you heard 'nothing? ---how they came to take me-&#xD;
how I escaped?"&#xD;
"Not a word! How was you found out?       How much was&#xD;
there of it?  Where did you pass it?  0," exclaimed the duch-&#xD;
ess, turning all sorts of colors, and exhibiting signs of consterna-&#xD;
tion in every lookand gesture, " my husband said 't would be so !&#xD;
If ever we was found out, 't would be through him ! Why did he&#xD;
bring you here? We shall all be taken together ! He 's the most&#xD;
rashest, inconsiderit man that ever I see ! Are they following&#xD;
you now?   Can they track you here?"&#xD;
"I do not know; my mind seems all confused! Either I do&#xD;
not understand you, else you do not understand me."&#xD;
"Did n't you know what kind it was when you passed it?"&#xD;
"What are you saying?"&#xD;
"Why ! " cried the duchess, "was n't it for passing?"&#xD;
" I do not know what you mean by passing. I am - I was -&#xD;
they call me- a fugitive -a slave ! They have come to claim&#xD;
me, -to take me back!"&#xD;
"You! Mercy ! is that it?  I thought-- dear me, what have&#xD;
I been talking ? Then you have n't had any of it? But what&#xD;
should he bring you here for? "&#xD;
"He is coming; he will explain to you; I cannot," said poor&#xD;
Camille. " But, 0, Mrs. Sperkley ! you are a woman; 'you will&#xD;
be my friend!"&#xD;
"Wait !A" said the duchess. "There 's his knock."   She&#xD;
sprang to undo the fastenings of the door. At sight of. Robert&#xD;
entering, Camille's vision grew dark, and a few minutes later, with&#xD;
but a dim consciousness of what had taken place, she found her-&#xD;
self lying upon a bed, in a strange apartment, with Robert bend-&#xD;
ing over her, while Mrs. Sperkley bathed her lips and temples.&#xD;

" Drink," said Robert, holding a glass to her lips. "It will do&#xD;
you good."&#xD;
" No, - leave me," entreated Camille.&#xD;
" It is a. simple restorative; you need it much," insisted&#xD;
Robert.&#xD;
"Perhaps; but I will not drink."&#xD;
" Go !"- Mrs. Sperkley pushed Robert away. -" I can man.&#xD;
age her !"  And the little woman presented the draughtwith one'&#xD;
of her most confident and persuasive smiles. To her astonishment,&#xD;
it was still refused. . " Why, 't an't bad ! Jest taste it."&#xD;
Camille glanced suspiciously at Robert's retreating figure. "I&#xD;
have heard," she whispered, "of people being drugged! 0, Mrs.&#xD;
Sperkley, you will be true to me ! and, if I should not be all the&#xD;
time in my right mind, you will not let me take any hurtful drink,&#xD;
--tell me that!"&#xD;
"Who ever heard of such a thing?7" ejaculated the duchess.&#xD;
"Look ! " and she drank the potion at a breath. "It 's wine,&#xD;
right from my husband's bottle. He always has the best o' wine.&#xD;
You shall see me pour some for you."&#xD;
After that, Camille drank. The wine revived and warmed her.&#xD;
She wished then to be left alone, and Mrs. Sperkley withdrew.&#xD;
She was lying languidly upon the bed, with her eyes closed, think-&#xD;
ing unutterable thoughts, and searching deeply within herself for&#xD;
the light of Wisdom to guide and sustain her, when the creaking&#xD;
of the door, and a footstep by the bed, startled her. She looked&#xD;
up, and saw Robert entering softly.&#xD;
" I am sorry if I disturb you," he said, in a low tone. " If you&#xD;
can sleep, let me sit here and watch."&#xD;
" I prefer to be alone," answered Camille, closing her eyes&#xD;
again, and covering her face. He dropped upon his knees by her&#xD;
side. He groaned; his frame shook; she heard the gnashing of&#xD;
his teeth. "Will you leave me, sir? " she said, more firmly-than&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"Yes, since you wish it."  But he did not move. There was a&#xD;
long pause. "0, God !" he burst forth at length, "why are you&#xD;
so beautiful? why are you so lovely ?"&#xD;
" Robert Greenwich !" she cried, starting up, " will you go ?" -&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WILDERNESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
887&#xD;
&#xD;
" Camille," he answered, in tones stifled by passion, "I h ve&#xD;
sworn, and I will keep my word. But hear me one moment.&#xD;
Your only safety is in me. You shall-rest here until to-morrow;&#xD;
but Canada must be reached ; there is danger in delay. We&#xD;
will go together. The service, the love, the life of a great soul,&#xD;
is yours, if you will accept it. Have I not shown my devotion&#xD;
to-day ? Do you not think differently of me ? .m I not wor-&#xD;
thy at least to be your servant?"&#xD;
" No ! " said Camille. " Tempter ! I will not hear you ! "&#xD;
"You still have hope of Hector. But he cannot save you. His&#xD;
attempt to purchase you has proved abortive. No wealth could&#xD;
satisfy your owner. If you are taken, you must return to slavery.&#xD;
This is hard language, but it is the truth. I wish you to know&#xD;
your danger, and to know me."&#xD;
" My danger is in you -I know no other ! 0, it is you who&#xD;
have done me treacherous' wrong; it is to you I owe so much&#xD;
suffering! Perhaps what you tell me is true ; perhaps Hector&#xD;
could not save me, were he here;. but, sir, rather than live your&#xD;
favorite, even your wife, I would die beneath the feet of swine!&#xD;
Why will you not understand me? Why will you not believe&#xD;
the testimony of my soul? It is my whole nature my life, my&#xD;
very being, that rises up against you ! "&#xD;
Robert struggled with himself, striving, perhaps, to keep the&#xD;
oath which he had not indeed taken in idle mood. But resolution&#xD;
was weak. Passion was mighty. He'saw Camille in his power.&#xD;
The gulf of temptation opened beneath him like a hell. He&#xD;
seized her hand.&#xD;
" Touch me not ! " she cried, "Serpent!!"&#xD;
And, feeble as she was, she sprang up, flying from his approach.&#xD;
"Greenwich ! " called the duchess, from without. Robert made&#xD;
no response; she then began to knock violently, and shake, the&#xD;
door, which,- as Camille discovered, to her dismay -had been&#xD;
bolted on the inner side.&#xD;
" What do you want? " demanded Robert.&#xD;
" Do come out ! " whispered the duchess. "There 's a sleigh&#xD;
in the bush. Some men are coming to the door, and I 'm fright.&#xD;
ened to death !"&#xD;

A shadow swept over Robert's face.  "How many?"&#xD;
" Three or four. They 're knocking ! What shall I do ?"&#xD;
Robert slipped back the bolt, glided from  the chamber, and&#xD;
obtained a hasty glimpse at the party, through a loophole near&#xD;
the outer door of the hut. The knocking was repeated.&#xD;
" Shall I open ?" whispered the agitated duchess.&#xD;
He put her off, and hastened back to Camille. "That accursed&#xD;
Dickson ! They have tracked us by the snow.    Shall I save&#xD;
you?"-&#xD;
" Save me ! how ?"'said the pallid girl.&#xD;
" Say but the word, and 't is done! There 's not an instant to&#xD;
lose !"-&#xD;
"What do you mean?"-&#xD;
"Look at me ! You have distrusted, scorned me, spat upon&#xD;
me ! . I'm not the fool to serve you for such pay. Choose now&#xD;
your-fate!"           .&#xD;
"How -choose?"S&#xD;
"iBetween me and slavery! Between me and perhaps a dozen&#xD;
brutal masters ! Speak - at once !"&#xD;
The knocking at the door had become loud and violent. Robert&#xD;
grasped Camille's arm, as she supported herself by the bed. Her,&#xD;
suffering and terror were extreme ; but, in the midst of all, she&#xD;
kept her bright unchanging look on his, and a resistless spiritual&#xD;
power seemed poured upon her, as she spoke.-&#xD;
"'Come a thousand evils, come slavery, come death ! -I can&#xD;
die, but I cannot sin!"S&#xD;
Dickson's party thundered at the door.&#xD;
" Consider ! " said Robert, with flaming eyes. "In their hands&#xD;
you will be lost. Vengeance and hatred are hungry for you !&#xD;
There is in this house a place of concealment, which I would defy&#xD;
an army of Dicksons to discover ! Once there, you are safe.&#xD;
Promise me your love, and nothing shall harm you!"&#xD;
"I cannot resist wrong with wrong; I cannot promise falsely !"&#xD;
answered Charlotte.  "Save me for justice, for mercy, --I will&#xD;
thank you; but, if for your own selfishness, I shall scorn you the&#xD;
more !" ---&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WILDERNESS.                    889&#xD;
lows shook the door of the hut, and voices called and threat-&#xD;
ened. Mrs. Sperkley ran to and fro, beside herself with terror.&#xD;
"Is this your answer ?" hissed Robert.&#xD;
"It is my answer !" came the firm response.&#xD;
Robert rushed to the door, and threw it broadly open. "Dick-&#xD;
son," said he, " I'm glad to see you."&#xD;
" Greenwich ! " said Dickson, with a ferocious look, " I'm&#xD;
glad to see you !  A mighty fine trick you 've played us ! "&#xD;
"It 's a trick for which you '11 thank me ! "&#xD;
" With a vengeance!" growled Dickson. "Where 's that gal?"&#xD;
"In a safe place- for you. , Crumlett has flunked; he warned&#xD;
her to escape. Mrs. Rukely called to me for help, as I was riding&#xD;
by. I brought her here,-to keep her until word could be got to&#xD;
you. If this is the"way I am thanked, -there is your prey;&#xD;
clutch her, and good luck to you !"  And, as the human hounds,&#xD;
cheered on by the stanch Oliver Dole, rushed into the chamber&#xD;
of the defenceless fugitive, the traitor Robert turned his back,&#xD;
and fled. He ran to a hovel in the thicket close by ; there stood&#xD;
his horse, where he had left him ; he brought him out, leaped&#xD;
into the sleigh, lashed him with his whip, and, dashing past the&#xD;
house, and along the narrow, winding path, reached the road,&#xD;
and returned the way'he came.&#xD;
The storm had ceased. Before him spread the woodland, calm&#xD;
and still. Over the whited ground, beneath the snow-laden&#xD;
boughs, amid the solemn trunks that stood amazed as he passed,&#xD;
he urged his horse's speed with whip and rein. The snow seemed&#xD;
a mantle dropped from heaven for his destruction. It had sailed&#xD;
down before him, to receive the fatal print of his hoofs and run-&#xD;
ners in the woods; but it had failed to cover his track, when he&#xD;
passed on. It was the flight of guilt, of wear, of baffled rage and&#xD;
shame: to quit the scenes of his unmanly acts, to fly his native&#xD;
land, to leave the past and remorse forever behind him ! 0, that&#xD;
whirlwinds would blow ! that the trees would groan and roar !&#xD;
that howling storms would cover his track with drifts ! He&#xD;
approached an opening of the wood. Beyond, above the shaggy&#xD;
mountain side, glowed the subdued fire of the afternoon sun through&#xD;
banks of gilded cloud, shooting mil4l rays athwart the forest tops,&#xD;

and tinging with faint gold the bosom  of the virgin snow.&#xD;
Overhead the myriad curving branches, the infinite net-work of&#xD;
silver-lined boughs, the roof of ebon tracery edged with pearl,&#xD;
opened, and brightened, and smiled in the blushing light. His&#xD;
career seemed all the more. fearful and guilty from contrast with&#xD;
this beauty. Perhaps he felt the eye of Deity looking down upon&#xD;
him then, or the bright heaven his sin had forfeited smiling in&#xD;
pity upon his flight.&#xD;
He lashed his horse, and was soon out of the wood. He had&#xD;
turned down the western track before he observed a horseman&#xD;
riding fast between him and the sun. He was approaching; they&#xD;
met ; lightning glances of recognition passed between them;&#xD;
Robert whipped on more furiously than before ; and the other,&#xD;
wheeling short on his course, spurred after him.&#xD;
The race was brief; but already the competitors had passed&#xD;
the village, astonishing spectators by the unusual scene, when the&#xD;
pursuer, galloping to the head of Robert's horse, grasped the rein,&#xD;
and with a sudden wrench, bearing the poor animal sheer from&#xD;
the track, broke his perilous speed against the road-side fence.&#xD;
The shafts were splintered, the cutter overturned, the rider hurled,&#xD;
headlong ; and Hector, wheeling again, leaped down from his&#xD;
palpitating steed, just as Robert, snow-covered, bruised, bewil-&#xD;
dered, was struggling to his feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
XLIII.&#xD;
THE LAW TAKES ITS COURSE.&#xD;
ALL right!" chuckled Dickson, as his hand grasped Camille's&#xD;
shoulder. "Come, my chick !   I reck'n you 'll go along 'thout&#xD;
any more fass ; there 's been fool'n' enough for one while."&#xD;
" No violence ! " interposed Oliver Dole. "Let the law quietly&#xD;
take its course; that 's all' we want."&#xD;
Camille, who had fallen upon her knees by the bed, attempted&#xD;
to rise, turning her suffering, bewildered looks upon the man of&#xD;
law. Such gentleness and frailness, such loveliness and distress,&#xD;
he had little expected to behold. His stern face contracted with&#xD;
pain, as his public conscience was momentarily surprised by a ray&#xD;
of human feeling that stole into his heart. With a softened look,&#xD;
he extended his hand, to support her faltering step ; when suddenly&#xD;
she fell like one dead at his feet.&#xD;
"Jones-!" cried Dickson, " pass yer flask ! I'11 fetch her out&#xD;
of this ! I 've seen sech tricks 'fore to-day."&#xD;
"What you going'to do with her?" screamed the affrighted&#xD;
duchess.&#xD;
"Jest you stan' one side,.and hold yer clatter,.-that's all I&#xD;
ask of you ! "  And Dickson roughly administered the restorative&#xD;
to his victim, holding her head upon his knee.&#xD;
"I'm astonished to find her so feeble ! " exclaimed Oliver Dole.&#xD;
"She ought n't to be moved till she 's stronger."&#xD;
" If she could run away, she can go with us !" growled&#xD;
Dickson.&#xD;
"Greenwich has give us the slip!" cried Jones. "There he&#xD;
goes, by Jehu!'"&#xD;
"After him, Jones! Take the little sleigh. Ketch him, if&#xD;

barg'in !"&#xD;
"Keep yer fist onto her!" cried Jones, at parting.&#xD;
"Resk me, for that !  I don't quit my holt, till she 's safe&#xD;
under lock and bar, make sure o' that ! Ah ! com'n' to a bit,&#xD;
be ye ? That 's right ; spunk up ! It 's got to come;- and the&#xD;
sooner it 's over, the quicker.  Here, you apple-face," - to&#xD;
the duchess, - "han't she got no bunnit, nor noth'n',? "&#xD;
Mrs. Sperkley brought Camille's things, and, in great trepi-&#xD;
dation, assisted to put them  on.  Then the helpless form was&#xD;
lifted in the arms of the brutal man, and borne to the sleigh.&#xD;
"Be careful with her," said Oliver Dole.  "It 's hard'business&#xD;
enough, make the best on 't."&#xD;
"Don't ye s'pose I know what 's for my interest?  Of course&#xD;
I'1l be car'ful; I'll handle her like an egg. Make a place on&#xD;
the s leigh-bottom; we can keep her warm twixtt our feet."&#xD;
" Good heavens, don't drop her head that way !&#xD;
"Lord, she '11 live through it, only fix her so 's 't she can&#xD;
breathet" said Dickson. " Seems to me ye 've growed might&#xD;
chick'n-hearted, since our 'quaint'nce begun.  You was fierce&#xD;
enough for the business ! Bat, since these cussed north'n dough-&#xD;
faces set up sech a yell against us, you 've looked a mighty sight&#xD;
like fiunk'n'.  There, she 'l go so, comf'table enough, I reck'n.&#xD;
Now, driver, git out o' this bush fast as yer horses '11 carry us!"&#xD;
The horses were fleet ; the driver stanch, well-paid, and eager&#xD;
in the hunt; and they soon reached the opening of the wood.&#xD;
"Slack up, half a sec'nt! " cried Dickson. "I 's in hopes we 'd&#xD;
ketch Jones and Greenwich; but let 'em go ! How d'ye git on,&#xD;
my gal?   Pooty comf'table?"J&#xD;
Camille lay still and pale as death, in the position in which she&#xD;
had been placed. Her eyes were closed ; she did not speak ; she-&#xD;
appeared scarce to breathe. Dickson's brows gathered.&#xD;
"I don't like the looks o' that face ! I reck'ned she 'd come&#xD;
to, 'fore this, and scream, and take on, like they gen'ly do. I&#xD;
don't fancy driven' through the village with her, nuther; 't would&#xD;
be hard keep'n'her out o' sight; and yer .north'n ab'lish'n folks&#xD;
are sech cussed fools !"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE LAW    TAKES ITS COURSE.             393&#xD;
"T' other road '11 be 'bout as near," remarked the driver.&#xD;
Then take it ; and don't let next spring's grass grow under&#xD;
yer runners, nuther ! S'pos'n' we git her up, so 's 't she can suck&#xD;
the air a little freer. I wish I 'd kep' Jones' flask ! Why the devil&#xD;
did n't I ? That would fix her."&#xD;
Oliver's face was troubled. He bent anxiously over the help-&#xD;
less captive, endeavoring to raise her to an easier position. "How&#xD;
do you feel now? A little better, an't ye ? You must pluck up&#xD;
courage; you 're perfectly safe; you 're in the hands of the law,&#xD;
and there '11 be no injustice ; try to go through it bravely,  you&#xD;
will, won't ye ?" But only a low moan escaped her, and her head&#xD;
sank powerlessly upon his arm.&#xD;
"There, I like that better !" exclaimed Dickson. "'S long 's&#xD;
they can make that noise, there 's hopes on 'em. 0, she 'Il git&#xD;
through 't, somehow. -They all act so. Thar 's a mighty sight o'&#xD;
sham 'bout these yer white ones. They 're 'maz'n' shrewd ; tough,&#xD;
too, some on 'em are."&#xD;
"There 's no sham here !" said Oliver Dole.&#xD;
"Wal, sham or no sham, she 's got to go ! Git her safe once,&#xD;
then I '11 have a doctor look to her; but I an't go'' to run no&#xD;
resks ! Don't her bunnet choke her?"&#xD;
Dickson's impatient fingers tore the strings. A slight shrinking&#xD;
and shuddering,'as his rough hand touched her throat, was the&#xD;
only sign of consciousness she gave. All external things had.&#xD;
grown dim and shadowy around her. To Dickson's brutal speech,&#xD;
to the officer's kinder words, to cruelty, humiliation, bodily pain,&#xD;
she was alike insensible. Not that feeling was dead, --- but one&#xD;
deep, unspeakable agony absorbed all. iShe knew not when the&#xD;
steeples and chimneys of the town appeared in view; when the&#xD;
sight of the jail, with its barred windows and grim stone walls,&#xD;
gladdened Dickson's ferocious eyes ; nor when the commissioner's&#xD;
house was reached.&#xD;
A bald, hump-backed, pursy, Union-saving judge, threw open&#xD;
the door of welcome to the hunters of human flesh. Then once&#xD;
more she was lifted rudely; strong arms bore her from the&#xD;
sleigh; behind her,.doors were closed; she was in a strange-&#xD;
looking apartment ; -all this flitted like mist over the agoniz-&#xD;

ing dark of her mind; and she sat listless, dumb, with death&#xD;
upon her face and in her heart, while the sickening, horrid&#xD;
dream went on.&#xD;
She was now half conscious of human shapes thronging the&#xD;
room'; of eyes fixed upon her, some in stony curiosity, some in feeble&#xD;
pity ; of low, fierce, rapid words spoken, which seemed somehow&#xD;
mixed with her fate ; of a stern-visaged man at a desk, question-&#xD;
ing and writing ; of a pale-faced, solemn clock staring upon her,&#xD;
from the wall; and of many things mingled, undefined, whirling&#xD;
and whirling in filmy indistinctness around her.&#xD;
She had no sense of the time that elapsed. To Dickson, it&#xD;
was just twenty-seven minutes, by his hunting-watch.  His&#xD;
brows blackened with impatience.  He thrust the timepiece&#xD;
back into his pocket, and dashed the sweat from his forehead.&#xD;
"An't we never go'n' to git through ?  What yer wait'n' for&#xD;
now ?" The hump-backed judge sat at his desk, signing a jail order,&#xD;
with a grimace of official wisdom. Oliver Dole stood to receive&#xD;
the document. Dickson, furious, stamped the floor. Lawyers&#xD;
and spectators pressed around. In the midst, two men supported&#xD;
Camille upon her chair. Others, stationed at the doors and win-&#xD;
dows, kept back the clamorous crowd.&#xD;
"Marshal Dole !" spoke the judge's iron voice. There was a&#xD;
hush of expectation, as, shaking the, ink-sand from.the paper, he&#xD;
folded it, with a calm stroke of his fingers, and passed it over the&#xD;
desk. Oliver thrust it in his breast-pocket, and with a trouble of&#xD;
face that might have impeached his public conscience, turned to&#xD;
his poor captive.&#xD;
"Got it?" cried Dickson. " C1'ar the way! Have yer men&#xD;
on hand, marshal.!  If the mob wants fun, they shall have it !"&#xD;
And he adjusted a pistol beneath his coat.&#xD;
"tbon't offer provocation !". exclaimed Oliver, huskily. " March&#xD;
out peaceable, and in order. Let the girl take my arm, -'t will&#xD;
look better."     .&#xD;
"Come ! " muttered Dickson, shaking Camille's shoulder.&#xD;
She started,Cand breathed quick, a momentary gleam of reason&#xD;
flashing from her vacant eyes.&#xD;
" Is it -to-night?7" she uttered, like one half awake.&#xD;

"Yes,'it 's to-night!" said Dickson, coarsely. "Come, ye 're&#xD;
go'n' to walk a step or two, d' ye know it ?"&#xD;
" Am I- going?"&#xD;
"Yes, my gal; you're goin'. Can't be helped, ye know; so&#xD;
cheer up, look bright, show yer pluck once ! "&#xD;
"Let me stay one night !" pleaded Camille, in a voice so&#xD;
utterly weak and helpless, that only those immediately surround-&#xD;
ing her could hear,&#xD;
" Have this veil over yer face !" said Dickson. "Ye don't&#xD;
want'to be seen iook'n' babyish, ye know. Now take the mar-&#xD;
shal's arm. I'll hold on t' other side, so 's 't ye shan't fall. Be&#xD;
accommodat'n', and 't '11 go a mighty sight easier with ye than if&#xD;
ye 're contrary, ye know." And, with a rude grasp, he attempted&#xD;
to lift her to her feet.&#xD;
" Shall I never see him again ?" she implored, in a faint, sob-&#xD;
bing utterance.  " Am I to be taken right away?"&#xD;
" Hang it ! " cried Dickson, " ye 're only go'n' to jail, ye&#xD;
knows   So don't be seart, my gal.  You '11 be kep' there to-&#xD;
night,- and it may be a day or two 'fore the judge gives his&#xD;
decish'n. So spunk up; it 's got to' come, ye know ; 't an't no&#xD;
use cavin in."&#xD;
Thereupon, gathering some little hope, she knew not what, or&#xD;
wherefore, Camille made a-feeble effort to arise.&#xD;
" That's the talk !" said Dickson, clasping her with brute force.&#xD;
"I got ye; ye can't fall, if ye try. Keep up your side, marshal.&#xD;
Now, then, one foot right ahead o' t' other; no flinch'n'! Thar!"&#xD;
- as she made a step towards the door, -- "what 'd I tell ye?&#xD;
Now 's our time, marshal !"&#xD;
Camille stopped; her limbs grew rigid ; her form bent back,&#xD;
writhing, as in a mortal spasm.&#xD;
"None o' that!" muttered Dickson, shaking her.   "Come,&#xD;
*valk ! Y want me to carry ye, hey ? "&#xD;
She was waking. It was no more a dream. The awful mean-&#xD;
Mug of it all burst upon her. Freedom, happiness, taken forever&#xD;
away! Hope, life, love, all, all gone! A fate more horrible than&#xD;
a thousand deaths awaiting her ! and she alone, defenceless, help-&#xD;
less, delivered over to ruffians by the LAW itself! 0, God ! 0,&#xD;
God ! O, God !&#xD;

896            THE LAW TAKES. ITS COURSE.&#xD;
With sharp agony, consciousness came. She roused, and, tearing&#xD;
aside the veil, stood frenzied, casting a heart-chilling gaze around.&#xD;
There was a pause, then a tumult at the door, which was broken&#xD;
in; and a wildflgure, with hair disordered, and eyes darting fury,&#xD;
rushed into the room. - Camille's voice burst in a shriek. Oliver&#xD;
Dole reeled against the shattered window. Dickson was hurled&#xD;
back ; and a swift arm caught up the pallid girl as she was sink-&#xD;
ing to the floor.&#xD;
"She is mine !" thrilled a proud voice through the room. And&#xD;
hector, defiant, held the throbbing form upon his heart. A shud-&#xD;
der of awe passed through the spectators; officers and judge&#xD;
recoiled before him.&#xD;
"She is mine !" said Dickson, recovering himself, and clutching&#xD;
Camille's arm; "by order of this court,  by the laws of the&#xD;
country ! "&#xD;
Hector thrust him off. " She is mine," he cried, " by the decree&#xD;
of heaven, - by the one eternal Law ! "&#xD;
"That don't hold in our courts!'" muttered Dickson. 'I call&#xD;
a   upon the marshal to do his duty ! "&#xD;
"Amen ! "   Hector turned to the court, his scorn and fury&#xD;
quivering in every fibre of his frame, in every line and curve of&#xD;
his lion-like face. "I call upon all to do the duty of men ! There&#xD;
is no power to take from me my OWN ! "&#xD;
" You 'll see !" spluttered Dickson. " Here 's the judge!&#xD;
here 's the marshal's force I-she 's got to go !"&#xD;
"'Mr. Dunbury," spoke the judge, "you forget yourself. You&#xD;
are resisting the execution of the law."&#xD;
" Ketch holt here-!" roared Dickson.&#xD;
Mr. Dole and his deputies pressed forward. Hector held&#xD;
them off less by the might of his arm than' by the terrors of&#xD;
his eye.&#xD;
"Hers is a human soul ! "----he bore his living burden nobly&#xD;
up, and a solemn power rolled through hisstones.  "'T is bound&#xD;
to mine ! And what God has joined, man cannot, SUALL NOT, put&#xD;
asunder ! ".&#xD;
" Curse his trash !" frothed Dickson. " What ye all about ?&#xD;
Why don't ye ketch holt?7" And, clutching Camille again, Le&#xD;
thrust his pistol into*Hector's face. "1I '11 shoot ye, by- "&#xD;
&#xD;
'&#xD;
&#xD;
THE LAW TAKES ITS COURSE.              897&#xD;
The oath was gulped back, and he tumbled upon the floor like&#xD;
a log. Hector held - 1Is OWN ! He strode with strong strides&#xD;
towards the door.  The officers faltered; the crowd gave way&#xD;
before him; the judge's feeble remonstrance died in his throat.&#xD;
Then turning, with wrath and defiance stamped upon his front,&#xD;
Hector beckoned to the minion of the law. " Give that to your&#xD;
master ! " and his hand reached forth a paper to Oliver Dole, who&#xD;
delivered it to the judge.&#xD;
Dickson scrambled upon his feet, and 'made a furious lunge at&#xD;
persons in the crowd who had seized his weapon;, but it was flung&#xD;
from the window. Again there was a hush, as the judge glanced&#xD;
his eye over the paper's contents. Dickson stood like a baffled&#xD;
wild beast, that knew not which way to turn. The judge rapped&#xD;
upon his desk. There was no need. Attention was breathless.&#xD;
"This paper stops all legal proceedings! THE GIRL IS FREE!&#xD;
The strained silence broke. A commotion swelled, bursting&#xD;
into the'very presence of the judge, from the crowd without. In&#xD;
the midst of all stood Hector, wonderful to look upon, in his&#xD;
bright, manly strength, with Camille still throbbing upon his&#xD;
breast.&#xD;
"She is free ! free !" ran from mouth to mouth through the&#xD;
crowd.&#xD;
"A fraud ! " fore forth Dickson's infuriate, speech. He&#xD;
rushed to the desk. His eyes flamed upon the paper. He stood&#xD;
a moment, stupefied, then smote the signature with his fist, and&#xD;
broke out, huskily, "By God, it 's Tanwood's !"&#xD;
Hector had turned again. Oliver Dole was but too glad to&#xD;
wash his hands of their shameful work. There was no opposi-&#xD;
tion from him or his deputies: Hector strode over the thresh-&#xD;
old.  The crowd would have borne him upa their shoulders.&#xD;
But there wasa majesty in his look, that put them off.  A.&#xD;
sleigh was in waiting. He stepped in; he wrapped his precious&#xD;
burden'to his heart; and she, who was so late a thing, a slave,&#xD;
a chattel, rode out of the jubilant throng a SOUL, a WOMAN, &amp;amp;&#xD;
WiF  ovLONQ AND BELOVED.         ,     -   -&#xD;

XLIV.&#xD;
RETRIBUITION.&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE, within the compass of narrow walls, behind an iron-&#xD;
grated door, sat Robert Greenwich.&#xD;
The faint gleam of the sunset that tinged the high, barred&#xD;
windows had long since faded. The twilight gloom deepened.&#xD;
What was Robert thinking, at that hour?. What change had&#xD;
come over him since, haughty and erect, but ghastly pale, tearing&#xD;
his glossy moustache with his shaking hand, he marched through&#xD;
the iron doors, under the sheriff's charge?&#xD;
Darker still grew the prison. What silence ! What awful&#xD;
solitude ! Suddenly there was a clanking of doors and jingling&#xD;
of keys. The jailer, entering with a lantern, approached the pris-&#xD;
oner's cell.&#xD;
The yellow light revealed an appalling picture. Robert was&#xD;
scarcely recognizable. His -visage was distorted- he seemed to&#xD;
have grown old a dozen years.&#xD;
" Mr.. Greenwich," spoke the jailer. A fierce clown-look, a&#xD;
dark, despairing scowl, but no notion or word of reply.  "Is&#xD;
there any person you wish to send for ?"&#xD;
Robert looked up. His mouth was bloody, his hair torn, his,&#xD;
eyes haggard. " Does my father know?" By that hollow voice)&#xD;
one would not have guessed the speaker.&#xD;
'He has been sent for. He should be here soon. Anything&#xD;
else?"&#xD;
"No !"   The keeper hung his lantern upon a pendent chain,&#xD;
in the common hall; then, walking away with his jingling keys,&#xD;
the heavy prison-doors closed after him, with a dismal jar.&#xD;
Two prisoners, at large in the common hall, placed a light&#xD;

&#xD;
wooden table beneath the swinging lamp, and, producing a well-&#xD;
worn pack of cards, commenced a cheerful game of all-fours. No&#xD;
other society in the jail; no sounds but their quiet conversation.&#xD;
Robert shrunk back within the shadow of his cell, burying his&#xD;
face in his hands, that he might neither see nor hear.&#xD;
In a little while su per was brought him. The men ate at&#xD;
their table, with appetie,- putting aside their cards. Robert&#xD;
seized his pitcher and drank plentifullybut left the food untasted;&#xD;
then sat still, as before, save that now and then his choked breath&#xD;
canie hissing through his teeth, and the ague of despair- shook the&#xD;
stool on whichhe sat.&#xD;
Once more the iron doors opened, and a visitor, entering, was&#xD;
locked in the jail. He was a spare man, with a wrinkled face,&#xD;
and a stern, dictatorial expression. Walking with a quick step&#xD;
towards the cell to which the keeper pointed him, he gazed at the&#xD;
wretched object seated within. s" SON RoBERT !" he enunciated,&#xD;
in amazed and indignant accents.&#xD;
"Ha ! you have come ! " cried Robert, starting up.&#xD;
He sprang to the grated door with infuriate looks, and quiver-&#xD;
ing hands half closed, as if, in the madness of his rage, he would&#xD;
have torn the other limb from limb. The apparition was so sud-&#xD;
den that 'Squire' Greenwich recoiled with the instinct of fear.&#xD;
Robert pressed against, the iron bars, glaring out upon him&#xD;
savagely.&#xD;
"Son Robert, what is the meaning of this ?"&#xD;
"It means death ! " said Robert's husky voice.&#xD;
Drops of sweat started upon the 'squire's astonished face.&#xD;
" Son Robert, are you insane?"&#xD;
The prisoner wiped the foam from his lips unconsciously, and,&#xD;
after a pause, struggling with himself, appeared more calm.&#xD;
" Does it seem so strange to you, to find me here?"&#xD;
. " Strange, son Robert ? Strange ?" and, for the first time in&#xD;
his life, the" prisoner heard a tremor of emotion in his father's&#xD;
voice. "You assuredly are not guilty -"&#xD;
"I'm 'guilty of all ! And I might have been guilty f more,&#xD;
could this hand have reached you!"  Robert wiped his' leeding&#xD;
lips again, and thrust his forehead, with its tangled hair, against&#xD;

the bars. "My life is blasted. I have no future. *My career&#xD;
ends here. And I have you to thank ! Do you understand'?&#xD;
You, sir, you ! "&#xD;
"Son Robert," articulated the 'squire, " I DO DOT understand.;&#xD;
[ am overwhelmed-! I could not believe my ears when that I&#xD;
heard of your arrest. I cannot now believe my senses when that&#xD;
I see andhear you ! Is it my son Robertswhom I see caged like&#xD;
an enraged beast ?""&#xD;
" Old man !" said Robert, " hear me ! It is for the last time,&#xD;
so heed me! Since the earliest years I can remember, I have&#xD;
had a burning hatred in my heart for you! When I waspa&#xD;
child, not a day passed but I said,' Some time he shall hear of-&#xD;
this!' That time has come. The hell that has been all my life&#xD;
kindling is bursting forth."&#xD;
"Son Robert ! beware ! Pause before you speak. Remember&#xD;
whom you address ! Respect the paternal head !"&#xD;
"Remember!,-would I could forget! Respect!-how have I&#xD;
learned to hate ! I cannot recall a single kind or loving word&#xD;
that ever you spoke to me. You were the tyrant -always!&#xD;
You ruled with a rod of iron. My most trivial faults were pun-&#xD;
ished with cruelty.  If there was any goodness in me, you&#xD;
crushed it out; while every evil trait I inherited --from you --&#xD;
was kept alive by you-- provoked and strengthened by your des-&#xD;
potism ! Revenge became a part of me. Because I dared. not&#xD;
vent it against you, I poured it upon others. That passion fired&#xD;
the rest. Now you behold me here ! And I tell you I'have you&#xD;
to thank ! Take that, my parting gift, and, hug it to your breast&#xD;
when I am gone.! "&#xD;
" Me to thank ! Truly, truly," -the 'squire's agitated hands,&#xD;
struggled convulsively with his stifling cravat, and his broken&#xD;
voice was pitiful to hear,--"truly, son Robert, you are beside&#xD;
yourself! - Who reared you up, from infancy, with unswerving&#xD;
care? Who disciplined your youth in all wholesome exercises&#xD;
of the mind? Who kept you at the Sabbath-school and at&#xD;
church?  Who put into your hands healthful moral treatises,&#xD;
and gave you tasks from the Scriptur's to com to memory ?&#xD;

0, wretched young man! where are the talents intrusted to your&#xD;
keeping ? Where are the seeds a pious parent planted ?&#xD;
" The talents have brought me here ; this is the harvest of the&#xD;
seeds ! You did all that you boast of, and so I say I thank you;&#xD;
for, by the very means you used, you made me hate you and your&#xD;
lessons. I loathed the Sabbath-school, because driven to it with&#xD;
a rod. I never came near a Bible but I struck or kicked it,&#xD;
because of those hated tasks. I am calm now ; I utter my solemn&#xD;
convictions, and you know I tell truths !"&#xD;
"Indeed," groaned-the 'squire, "indeed, I do not know!A My&#xD;
pride was in you, niy son, 0, my son ! I longed for the time&#xD;
when that we should behold you an ornament and an honor to the&#xD;
respectable name of Greenwich. I labored faithfully to that end.&#xD;
And is this the result?"&#xD;
Sobs broke the old man's utterance. Still he struggled, as.&#xD;
from long habit, to maintain his dignified speech and deportment;&#xD;
and it was touching to see the flood of his emotions bursting&#xD;
through the wreck of his poor, shattered pride. Robert looked&#xD;
on luridly.&#xD;
"There may be points" - the 'squire confessed, wiping his&#xD;
wrinkled brow ---" wherein I have fallen somewhat short of the&#xD;
highest wisdom. But, had I erred in all, . find no excuse for&#xD;
you. Still, you are my son. You bear the respectable name of&#xD;
Greenwich. And, whatever your faults, how glaring soever your&#xD;
ingratitude to my venerable hairs, I can yet find it in my heart to&#xD;
render you service."&#xD;
"You can render none. I will accept none. My hands have&#xD;
plunged into crime, and I choose ,to meet the penalties."&#xD;
"Crime ! crime ! a son of 'Squire Greenwich ? crime ! "&#xD;
" That is the word,! Would yon be gratified to know the&#xD;
history ? "&#xD;
"i would know, though my heart be cleft in twain! But, I&#xD;
beseech you, speak not in such bitterness and wrath.&#xD;
" Fair words, then, they shall be ; I'll be tender with your&#xD;
nerves, old man! And the story shall be short, though it goes&#xD;
back to times long before I left home. My vices ripened early.&#xD;
But I had learned hypocrisy in so perfect a family school, that&#xD;

you knew little of the wild  rights I wasted; escaping froni the&#xD;
house by stealth, and seizing what pleasure I could, in recompense&#xD;
for your tyranny by day. When I came of age, you gave me&#xD;
the liberty you could. no-longer restrain; I went south, and there,&#xD;
in the hot-bed of vice, my mature flourished. I ended by run-&#xD;
ning away with a slave-girl, leaving more debts and sins behind&#xD;
than I will stop to count. To provide myself with means, I&#xD;
forged a note, and followed her to Canada, where I fell in with&#xD;
a villanous speculator. He knew an ingenious rogue, who had&#xD;
invented a spurious coin ; and, as they proposed to set up, on a&#xD;
small scale, an opposition to the legitimate mint, I was invited to&#xD;
join them. I asked nothing better ; and we fitted up an old house&#xD;
in the woods, and established an apparatus. I have distributed&#xD;
a good deal of the proceeds. ' In short, I was brought here for&#xD;
counterfeiting. I might have escaped, but by ill-luck I fell in&#xD;
first with that accursed Hector, then with the sheriff. On my&#xD;
way here, I learned of my friend Sperkley's arrest, in Burlington.&#xD;
His faithful housekeeper, who passes for his wife, will expect him&#xD;
home in vain. Then there are the slave-catchers ; ,they will con-&#xD;
centrate all their rage on me. I set them on Camille's track ;&#xD;
and no questions were to be asked; but I had not the virtue to be&#xD;
faithful,?even to, them.  So, you. see, the son of respectable&#xD;
'Squire Greenwich "----what fierce sarcasm in those words!-"is&#xD;
provided for. I staked everything.- I have lost - and this is&#xD;
the end !"&#xD;
"God of mercies !" groaned the 'squire, "what do I hear !&#xD;
San Robert, my only son, the hope of my old age ! -you a&#xD;
double criminal - arrested -to be brought before a public court&#xD;
- tried; condemned, sentenced -0, God ! can- all this be in&#xD;

"Not quite ! " said Robert, with dark significance. "'T will&#xD;
be a shorter agony. Good-by ; remember what I have said. I&#xD;
have thrown that burden off. Now go-I would be alone."&#xD;
" But, my son," sobbed the broken-hearted old man, " while&#xD;
that I return to my dishonored and desolate home, Jet me at least&#xD;

" Carry with you my hatred and my curse !" said Robert:;&#xD;
" it 's all I have for you, and a good-night to you ! May your&#xD;
sleep be always peaceful as it will be this night !"&#xD;
The keeper reappeared ; and now the prisoner shrank back&#xD;
into -his cell. The heart-crushed parent, shaking with the palsy&#xD;
of his grief, struggled long within himself before he found voice&#xD;
again to speak.&#xD;
"Son Robert,".-the keeper was looking on, and it was sad to&#xD;
see the flickering ghost of the poor old man's dignity rise up&#xD;
once more,-" I shall see you in the morning."&#xD;
" Let me advise you to come early!," muttered Robert.&#xD;
The keeper advanced. "I shall do all in my power to make&#xD;
your son comfortable, 'Squire Greenwich; and if he has any com-&#xD;
mands--"&#xD;
" What are these men in for ?" asked Robert, designating the&#xD;
card-players.&#xD;
" The one in shirt-sleeves, for stealing a horse ; the other, for&#xD;
killing one of his children in a drunken fit."&#xD;
" Is the thing of which I am  accused so much worse than&#xD;
theft or murder, that, while they have the liberty of the jail, it is&#xD;
necessary to keep me caged ?"&#xD;
"0, by no means ! But, when you were brought in, it was&#xD;
thought advisable, for a while -"&#xD;
" You see I am calm now."&#xD;
The keeper selected a particular key from the bunch, and cheer-&#xD;
fully unlocked the door of the cell. The 'squire, meanwhile, had&#xD;
tottered to -the entrance. The two went out together. Then&#xD;
Robert threw himself upon his bunk, and lay there, tossing about,&#xD;
and tearing his flesh and hair by fits, until the suspended lamp&#xD;
burned out, and the card-players groped their- way in the dark to&#xD;
their separate cells.&#xD;
0, night ! O,agony ! 0, remorse ! -darkness, and woo, and the&#xD;
worm that gnaweth the heart !-how mysterious, how terrible,&#xD;

and the sinner, seeking to rush in with impure feet, is lightning-&#xD;
stricken with their fiery tongues. Only through righteousness, in&#xD;

&#xD;
blessed precincts of love and peace : and night, and agony, and&#xD;
remorse,-darkness, and woe, and the worm that gnaweth the&#xD;
heart, - God sends to teach the LAW.&#xD;
All night Robert lay in his torment. But at the earliest glim-&#xD;
mer of dawn he arose, and sat upon his bed. There was now a&#xD;
sort of calmness in hisface, a fearful repose. And so he sat,&#xD;
while the slow, cold dawn advanced, twirling and twirling his&#xD;
silken cravat in his hands. At length he got up, and opened the&#xD;
door of his cell.&#xD;
Darkness still hovered in the jail. But from the high windows&#xD;
a faint grayish light radiated upon the walls, and -streamed along&#xD;
the floor. Robert stepped noiselessly across the hall. He reached&#xD;
the table where the card-players had sat the night before, stepped&#xD;
upon it with his knotted cravat in his hand, listened for a moment&#xD;
to the heavy breathing in the cells, then carefully removed the&#xD;
lantern from the chain.&#xD;
What stillness ! what-solemnity ! what gloom ! Suddenly there&#xD;
was a crash. The table had fallen ; the lantern rattled upon the&#xD;
floor. The horse-stealer started from his sleep. He rose up; he&#xD;
gazed listening, affrighted, in his cell. But did he hear the&#xD;
struggles, the conflict of fife and death, or see the dim, ghastly'&#xD;
figure swinging by the chain ?&#xD;
&#xD;
XLV.&#xD;
CLOSING SCENES.&#xD;
&#xD;
STRANGE is this boon of existence ! How sacred ! how fatal !&#xD;
how sweet ! 0, sorrow ! 0, love! 0, despair ! why have ye con-&#xD;
spired ?&#xD;
Beautiful is this dear, warm flesh ! The miracle of the heart-&#xD;
'beat, of the rushing blood, how wonderful! Sensation, how&#xD;
delicious ! Thought, affection, aspiration, the delirium of joy, -&#xD;
thank God for all. Yet, beware, 0, man ! 0, woman ! penalty&#xD;
and peril hem us in ; and we know not how terrible a tling it. is&#xD;
to profane the sanctity of the soul.&#xD;
Sin, tumult, endless toil, a little laughter, many tears, agony,&#xD;
longing, and the baffling search : such is man's history. 0, Father !&#xD;
pity thy children!&#xD;
Life is a fiery furnace, and none see God save those who have&#xD;
passed through the burning. Purification is born of the fire; the&#xD;
faithful shall not perish ; brightness, triumph, heaven, await us ;&#xD;
and, to some there comes great peace. If there is anything for&#xD;
which one should thank God, it is peace. In that still lake sleep&#xD;
all life's turbulent streams. Its bosom is the mirror of God; lo,&#xD;
heaven lies deep within ! all around, a light, ineffably soft and&#xD;
glorious, radiates and swims; and a hush, as of Sabbath stillness,&#xD;
of joy, of thanks, and of worship, fills all the summer air.&#xD;
Such a hush pervaded Mr. Jackwood's house. There were&#xD;
words-but how gently spoken ! there was laughter-but how sub-&#xD;
dued and mellow ! there were tears - but how bright and happy !&#xD;
"iThis 'ere 's a day wuth livin' to see!",observed the farmer.&#xD;
He sat upon a keg in the corner, whittling an ox-bow; but, some-&#xD;

he would pause, holding his hands abstractedly, his countenance&#xD;
beaming with the light of a deep, earnest joy.  "Don't seem to&#xD;
me it 's right to work; it's kind o' like Sunday.",&#xD;
"Don't le's !", said Bim, who had been set to scour the table-&#xD;
knives, but who took a great deal more interest in'his mother's&#xD;
baking. "I got two. on 'em bright, - this one 's for Charlotte,&#xD;
any how ! Let the rest go, - I would!"&#xD;
" Come, come ! " his mother spoke up, cheeringly, "work away,&#xD;
or you won't have enough to set the table with. The pies '11 take&#xD;
care o' themselves.".&#xD;
" Make 'em good, any wayV " exclaimed Bim. "Charlotte likes&#xD;
lots o' sugar in 'em."&#xD;
"Bim speaks two words for himself," chimed Phoebe's musical&#xD;
voice. "Here 's a little crust left, - what shall I do with it ?"&#xD;
"Bake Rove a turnover," cried Bim, "and I 'll eat it for&#xD;
him ! "&#xD;
"Shall I, mother ?".&#xD;
" Law, yes ; 'do gratify the boy ! But you must do them&#xD;
knives ! "&#xD;
"An't I?" said Bim.   He was holding the dog's lips apart.&#xD;
with'his fingers, for the purpose of inserting brickdust, from the&#xD;
scouring-board. "Rove's teeth are gittin' rusty, and I want 'em&#xD;
to look white for comp'ny."&#xD;
,The baking progressed finely. The big oven had been heated&#xD;
for the occasion." Extraordinary cakes, extravagant pies, emulous,&#xD;
puffy biscuits, - not-to speak of Rover's aristocratic turnover, --&#xD;
rested snugly in ,the corners, and bubbled, smoked, and swelled,&#xD;
in the genial heat., They seemed to know, as well as anybody,&#xD;
that they were no common cooking; and to feel a pride in coming&#xD;
out with plump, handsome, brown faces, with dimples, where&#xD;
Phoebe's fork had pricked, fit to appear before the choice com-&#xD;
pany in which they were to have the honor of b#'ing eaten.&#xD;
" 0; dear ! " exclaimed Phoebe, " I don't know what to do ! I&#xD;
want to laugh and cry! I wish it was dinner-time; then I could&#xD;
have an excuse to go to their room, and call them."&#xD;
" An't there somebody to the front door ?" said Mr. Jackwood.&#xD;

Bim went- skipping along the floor, followed by Rover, barking.&#xD;
Mr. Rukely entered.  There were warm greetings between him&#xD;
and the farmer, - questions, and earnest congratulations.&#xD;
"Why, father ! " said Mrs. Jackwood, with the kindliest of&#xD;
smiles,,and with mist in her eyes the while, "you hardly know&#xD;
what you 're about,I do declare!!"&#xD;
In his excitement, he had offered Mr. Rukely the keg to sit&#xD;
down upon. Mr. Rukely remained standing.&#xD;
"Set the big chair, Phoebe !" said the farmer.&#xD;
Mr. Rukely could not stop. He had called to see Hector.&#xD;
" I do'no' nobody they '11 be gladder to see ! " cried Mr. Jack-&#xD;
wood. "The way they spoke o' you 'n' your wife,-what you 'd&#xD;
done for 'em, -wal, 't an't of'n anything comes over me as that&#xD;
did ! Go to the spare room, Phoebe, -don't be noisy, but step&#xD;
light, an' jest rap kind o' gentle on the door."&#xD;
Phoebe could have asked no happier commission. To be near&#xD;
Camille, to hear the tones of Hector's voice, to look upon their&#xD;
faces for a moment, was 4elight enough for her.&#xD;
" Yes, sir!" cried Mr. Jackwood, "'t was great ! You should&#xD;
ben there to see ! You never 'd git over it, the longest day o'&#xD;
,your life, Mr. Rukely ! I hope I an't proud ; but I can't help&#xD;
thinkin' 't was my sleigh 't they got right into, an' 't I drove 'em&#xD;
away ! I hope I an't revengeful, nuther ; but I did feel a grudge&#xD;
agin them kidnabbers, an' I     Wal, 't was good enough for&#xD;
'fm ! I can't help sayin' so much, any way."&#xD;
"They was goin' to have our farm !" observed Bim, dis-&#xD;
damfully.&#xD;
"I guess they 'll let us alone," said his father, genially. "They&#xD;
sneaked out o' town las' night, like a couple. o' sheep-stealers. It&#xD;
'pears they tallygrafted that Cha'lotte was drownded; an' that 's&#xD;
what made her owner - as he called himself- so ready to sell&#xD;
out. A smart young lawyer done the business for Hector, an' got&#xD;
the man to sign off for little or nothin', I guess; though I could n't&#xD;
find out jest how much. That 's a terrible hard story they tell&#xD;
'bout Enos Crumlett."&#xD;
"I I'm afraid it 's true," replied the minister. " Matilda is quite&#xD;
wild about it-"&#xD;

"He 'd better go to Californy,. fust thing ! " exclaimed Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood.   "He never '1 be nothin','round here; everybody'11&#xD;
despise him. As for that Robert Greenwich -"&#xD;
"You have not heard -" said Mr. Rukely, a shadow passing&#xD;
over his face.&#xD;
"I herd he was took up for counterfeitin', - an' I wan't much&#xD;
surprised, nuther."&#xD;
- Mr. Rukely reported, in addition, a startling piece of intelli-&#xD;
gence that had spread through the town that morning. Astonish-&#xD;
ment and solemnity fell upon the listeners.&#xD;
"His poor father 'n' mother ! " uttered Mrs. Jackwood. " Don't&#xD;
mention it to Phoebe, -she 's too happy to-day."&#xD;
" What is suicide ?" cried Bion.&#xD;
" Hush! -'t an't nothin' you need to know 'bout !" said his&#xD;
father&#xD;
Phoebe reappeared, radiant. "He 's coming right out, - and&#xD;
I 'm going back to stay with Charlotte L"&#xD;
A minute later,; the door again opened. A thrill ran through&#xD;
Mr. Rukely's ordinarily sluggish veins. The countenance that&#xD;
shone upon him was in itself a life-history, a revelation. How&#xD;
changed since he last saw it ! Older, yet younger, and brighter ;&#xD;
sadder, yet imeasurably more happy ; serene, majestic, yet never,&#xD;
so soft and tender ; deeply thoughtful, deeply humble, yet smiling&#xD;
with the sweet, subdued effulgence of love and peace. Such was&#xD;
Hector on that memorable morning. He grasped Mr. Rukely's&#xD;
hand, and they conversed a few moments in presence of the fam-&#xD;
ily ; then Hector led the way to Camille's chamber. I&#xD;
The young wife was reclining by a cheerful wood fire, on the&#xD;
pillows of an easy-chair. With eyes swimming in blissful light,&#xD;
she looked up; a smile of wondrous beauty and sweetness wel-&#xD;
comed her friend, and the hand she gave him seemed all alive with&#xD;
the tremulous emotions of her heart.&#xD;
Was Mr. Rukely surprised to see her blooming with promise&#xD;
of fair health ? Ah, then, he did not know what magic lies in&#xD;
the sunshine of Love's face, - what subtle streams of life pour&#xD;
down into the very springs of our beipig from the sympathy and&#xD;
magnetic touch of those we hold- most dear. --~           -&#xD;
&#xD;
CLOSING SCENES.                  409&#xD;
Mr. Rukely had been sent for, that morning, by Mrs. Dunbury.&#xD;
He had found her greatly changed. The excitement that had&#xD;
sustained her through a long and terrible trial, subsiding, had left&#xD;
her extremely low. Charlotte was saved, Hector was happy; she&#xD;
.felt that she had nothing more to live for, and peaceful, not&#xD;
reluctant, she calmly awaited the end. After what had passed,&#xD;
knowing Hector's spirit, knowing Charlotte's wrongs and sufferings,&#xD;
she could not hope that they would return to the house from which&#xD;
a father's wrath had exiled them. But she had sent Mr. Rukely&#xD;
to them, with her love and blessing.&#xD;
Also, before setting out, the young minister had conversed with&#xD;
Mr. Dunbury. He spoke 'of that interview ; but, at mention of'&#xD;
his father, Hector shook his head, with a look of infinite sadness.&#xD;
"I know no father !" he said.            i&#xD;
" I have obtained his consent," Mr. Rukely went on, "for you&#xD;
to return home."&#xD;
"Home?" came the low echo from Hector's heart, and a heav-&#xD;
ing emotion struggled in his face, as he looked upon Camille;&#xD;
" where the spirit is at rest, is home ; hearts' love is home ; I AM&#xD;
AT HoME!"&#xD;
" What reply shall I make to.Mr. Dunbury ? "&#xD;
"Take to him these words !"&#xD;
"And your mother?"&#xD;
"0, my mother ! Tell her my soul loves her ; and souls that&#xD;
love, though divided on earth, reunite in heaven !"&#xD;
Camille wept. She joined in Hector's message to the invalid;&#xD;
and, shortly after, Mr. Rukely took his leave.&#xD;
It had been a comfort to learn that Mrs. Longman - Camille's&#xD;
dear Canadian friend, who had come to Edward's funeral - would&#xD;
remain with her relatives. No kinder hand, no warmer heart, than&#xD;
hers, could have been sent to administer to the failing invalid.&#xD;
Still Hector felt it as a deep wrong, Camille as a sad privation,&#xD;
that they, who owed her so much love and gratitude, they, who&#xD;
were dearer to her than all the world, should be so near, and yet&#xD;
attend not at the pillow of the dying woman,&#xD;
Three days passed, -days of hitherto inconceivable happiness,&#xD;
marred by but one shade of sorrow. They still remained the&#xD;

welcome occupants of the spare room in Mr. Jackwood's house.&#xD;
As Camille's strength increased, Hector was beginning to think&#xD;
of some quiet little home in the village, - but something said,&#xD;
- "Wait!"     On the afternoon of the fourth day, Corny was&#xD;
announced.&#xD;
" I got a letter for ye, somewheres," said that young gentle-&#xD;
man, making thorough investigations in his pockets. "Hello !-&#xD;
what 's this ?- I'd like to know!"  A worn and soiled envelope&#xD;
was brought to light.  "I did n't know I had that ! 0, I re-&#xD;
member !-- it 's what they gi' me in the village, one day, for Mis'&#xD;
Dan'b'ry, - an' I don't b'leve I ever thought on 't till this&#xD;
minute!"&#xD;
Hector tore the envelope, took out a slip of paper, and unfolded&#xD;
it, - 't was his own telegraphic despatch from Mobile ! He bit&#xD;
his lips, but, without a word, passed it to Camille. - Meanwhile,&#xD;
Corny had produced another letter.&#xD;
"That looks more like ! The ol' man tol' me to bring it over.&#xD;
He 's ben ra'al dumpy, lately ; an' it 's about the fust time he 's&#xD;
spoke'for five or six days. He don't growl to me no more, as he&#xD;
used to ; I guess it's 'cause he 's had some talks with Mis' Dun-&#xD;
b'ry ; for when he comes out o' her room, his eyes look kinder&#xD;
red an' watery, 's if he 'd like to cry, if he wan't a man. They&#xD;
don't spec' she'll live."&#xD;
"Camille !" said Hector, with solemn and anxious looks, " the&#xD;
hour has come ! We must go to our mother !"&#xD;
No time was to be lost. A few minutes sufficed for all prepa-&#xD;
ration. Corny h'ad come for them in the cutter; it was waiting&#xD;
at the door. The family made haste to warm blankets, -and a&#xD;
foot-stove was filled, to place at Camille's feet. Their thoughtful&#xD;
kindness was too much for the young wife.  She pressed Mr.&#xD;
Jackwood's hand to her lips, blessing him and his, from the burst-&#xD;
ing fulness of her heart.&#xD;
" If anybody should be thankful, it's me !" declared the farmer,&#xD;
brushing the tears' from his honest cheeks.  " Your coming' into&#xD;
my house, fust and last, has ben a blessin' to me an' to all; I&#xD;
can't be thankful enough for 't ! "&#xD;
&#xD;
CLOSING SCENES.                  411&#xD;
Hector wrung the farmer's hand. Words- seemed too feeble to&#xD;
express what swelled and burned within his breast.&#xD;
"Could you know how great my happiness in my wife, then you&#xD;
might know something of my gratitude to you, her preserver !"&#xD;
He placed Camille in the sleigh. Mrs. Jackwood wrapped the&#xD;
blankets around her, the farmer adjusted the foot-stove to her feet&#xD;
Phoebe arranged her veil, Bim stood holding the horse. A moment&#xD;
after, they were gone ; and loving faces, tearful eyes, watched&#xD;
them as they rode out of sight.&#xD;
It was the close of a very fair, calm winter's day. The forests&#xD;
on the mountain tops burned faintly in the sunset glow ; and the&#xD;
sky all above was arched with ribs and bars of fire. But the last&#xD;
tinge was fading from the clouds, and the forests grew drear and&#xD;
dark, as Hector and Camille approached Mr. Dunbury's house.&#xD;
Mrs. Longman received them at the porch. As she held Camille&#xD;
in her arms, Hector, advancing into the hall, saw the kitchen door&#xD;
open beyond, and his father pacing to and fro, with trouble written&#xD;
in deep lines upon his face. The young man turned aside, pausing&#xD;
a moment at the door of his mother's room, then gently lifted the&#xD;
latch.&#xD;
The subdued light of departing day stole into the chamber. A&#xD;
calm and holy atmosphere breathed around. He entered softly,&#xD;
and moved with silent steps to the bedside; then, stooping ten-&#xD;
derly and reverently, imprinted a kiss upon his mother's brow.&#xD;
She looked up. " My dear boy ! " Tears rained from Hector's&#xD;
eyes. He could not speak. "And Charlotte -" murmured the&#xD;
invalid.&#xD;
"She is here ! " He reached forth his hand. Camille advanced.&#xD;
He led her to the bedside; she bent. down amid the hush; her&#xD;
kisses and tears fell warm upon the dying woman's hand.&#xD;
"iMy child ! "-and feebly the invalid raised both ;her arms to&#xD;
place about her form, - "are you happy? "&#xD;
"0, blest!" sobbed Charlotte, upon her bosom.&#xD;
Another p-ause'; the love and peace of the invalid's countenance&#xD;
brightening and deepening. "And Hector?"&#xD;
" Twice blest !" breathed Hector. " But, to see my mother&#xD;

here, so feeble, and suffering so'-"  IHis voice was choked.&#xD;
Camille rose up gently ; they bowed together by the bed.&#xD;
" My children," said the invalid, as she looked upon them,&#xD;
"this is all I have asked ! I do not suffer now. My soul is&#xD;
full of peace.  I waited but for this hour, to fall sweetly into&#xD;
the arms of Heaven, and be forever at rest. Raise my head a&#xD;
little."&#xD;
-With a tender touch, Hector lifted her to an easie- position,&#xD;
adjusting the pillows beneath her head. " Always so kind, my&#xD;
boy ! Give me a little water."  Camille held the glass to her&#xD;
lips, while she drank. "'The same gentleness and love, dear one !&#xD;
Yes, Hector, I have waited but for this. Your father knows I&#xD;
have not long to stay. And, as he has seen me, for these few&#xD;
days past, sinking so rapidly, I have felt all the young love of his&#xD;
early years come back again, and his heart has been strangely&#xD;
softened ! He loves you, Hector! He feels that he has been&#xD;
unjust to you, -more than unjust to this dear one!"  A choking&#xD;
sensation broke her utterance ; but she added, presently, "Will&#xD;
you not forgive him ?"&#xD;
"0 , MOTHER!"&#xD;
There was a footfall upon the floor.  One entered, walking&#xD;
with careful steps ; crushed in spirit, his form bowed as by a&#xD;
burden, his chin sunken sorrowfully upon his breast. The little&#xD;
group opened. He drew near the bedside, reaching out his trem-&#xD;
bling hands.   A painful silence, then a quivering voice -&#xD;
" Hector !"&#xD;
The deep contrition of the look and tone ran like melting fire&#xD;
into Hector's soul.&#xD;
" FATHER !"  That one word expressed all,   Their hands&#xD;
clasped.  Forgiveness- flowed from heart to heart.  Then the&#xD;
father, taking courage, turned, with anguish in his looks, and&#xD;
extended a shaking hand to Camille.&#xD;
"My daughter! 'i"&#xD;
His long remorse, his crushed and penitent pride, and the new-&#xD;
born love of his soul gushing up through all, found utterance in&#xD;
those half-stifled words. 'illed with a wild grief, and yet wilder&#xD;
joy intermixed, Camille faltered, bowed her weeping face, and&#xD;

sank down at his feet. On the instant, as by quick sympathy,&#xD;
Hector was kneeling ~by her side; oie arm about her form, and&#xD;
cne hand clasped in hers.  The father extended his quivering&#xD;
palms above theni; while heavy drops struggled down his unac-&#xD;
customed cheeks.&#xD;
" God -bless you, -God bless you-my - children !&#xD;
"Peace ! " whispered, the dying woman, a smile of heavenly&#xD;
sweetness lighting all her'face,&#xD;
Peace ! And with that sacred word, the writer's task should&#xD;
end. Have we, then, gone through all these scenes of mirth, and&#xD;
passion, and woe, to reach a tearflil close? Blame not the writer.&#xD;
It was scarce his choice.  The characters whose fortunes he has&#xD;
depicted have not been altogether fictitious; they have been real&#xD;
existences to him, at least; he has laughed-with them, wept with&#xD;
them, and he would not part from them without tears., The nar-&#xD;
rative has been like a stream, holding its own free course ; and&#xD;
who could have known, when first we embarked in its limpid ripples&#xD;
and careless flow, how the waters were' to accumulate, and darken,&#xD;
and sweep us on?  There have been bubbles plenty, eddies and&#xD;
shallow falls, torrents and floods ; and now let all sink to rest in&#xD;
that still lake -described a little while ago-named Peace.&#xD;
"But what became of Bim ?   Was everybody happy at last?&#xD;
You have not told us ! And did Phoebe get married ?"&#xD;
Be patient, reader, and your questions shall be answered.&#xD;
Phoebe got married, of course. And she married a farmer, after&#xD;
all. If ever you go to Huntersford, inquire for Mrs. Higgins, -&#xD;
Phoebe married a Higgins,-- and you shall find her as bright and&#xD;
happy a young wife as you will see the next twelvemonth. Bim&#xD;
often visits-her, and brings Rover, -now a sedate and elderly&#xD;
dog, -to amuse the baby. The baby's name is Camille. There&#xD;
was a certain old lady who designed to have the child named&#xD;
Betsy Riggiesty; and who, on paying a visit to the young&#xD;
mother, and learning that her wishes had been disregarded, was&#xD;
so much offended, that, after a brief stay of six weeks (during&#xD;
which time she had a great deal to do with a dismal old cotton&#xD;
handkerchief, on whiich could be faintly traced a washed-out print,&#xD;

commemorating the praiseworthy conduct of a celebrated Samar-&#xD;
itan), she cut short her visit, and went back to Sawney Hook,&#xD;
resolved never again to quit that delightful region. Phoebe bears&#xD;
her absence with cheerful resignation, and still persists in calling&#xD;
the child Camille.&#xD;
BJim is growing up tall and ;manly, and his parents -are as&#xD;
genial and happy an old couple as ever enjoyed the blessings&#xD;
of an approving conscience, and the fruits of a life of 'industry,&#xD;
in their latter days.  Bim is beginning to go and see the girls ;&#xD;
and he wishes Etty Greenwich was n't quite so romantic in&#xD;
her notions. .Etty says she shall never be married. She devotes&#xD;
herself to poetry, and to the care of her white-haired father, who&#xD;
has grown quite infirm of late years.  Bim does not call at the&#xD;
house so often as he would like to; for the sight of the old man's&#xD;
quivering lips and broken smiles of affection, when Etty smooths&#xD;
his cravat or combs hishair, always makes the young gentleman&#xD;
cry, and that he thinks is unmanly.&#xD;
Of the Rukelys there is not much to be said.  Their outward&#xD;
life is very even, almost monotonous ; but inward trial has left its&#xD;
traces in Bertha's pale face. Matilda Fosdick lived in the family&#xD;
a year; when, taking pity on poor Enos, whom she had dismissed&#xD;
from the list of her suitors, on account of a certain transaction&#xD;
which had earned him the name of Judas Crumlett, she finally'&#xD;
consented to fill the place his venerable parent was expected soon&#xD;
to leave vacant, and removed with him to the West, after the re-&#xD;
niains of that lamented lady had been consigned to the tomb.&#xD;
In conclusion, shall we draw a picture of Hector and Camille&#xD;
entering upon their new life of labor and love, with the world's&#xD;
prejudice and frowns all unknown to their serene eyes ?  Of the&#xD;
broken father, bowed by his burden of sadness, yet redeemed by&#xD;
the memory of his sainted wife, and ripening into quiet and tender&#xD;
old age in the "light:of their affection ?  Of their first-born, won-&#xD;
drous boy, offspring of love and beauty, thrilling their fond hearts&#xD;
with his sweet prattle and -melodious laughter? 0, wedlock ! 0,&#xD;
holy love! let fall the veil, and hide the painful glory of thy face,&#xD;
in mercy to the longing souls and moaning hearts that have sought&#xD;
thy-home and rest, and found it not&#xD;
