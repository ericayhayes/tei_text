ALES OF THE&#xD;
'U12 MAdIAN'S 1)ATE.fl.&#xD;
Amasis was the youngest of the&#xD;
iagi who followed the wonderful star&#xD;
that shone day and night until it hung&#xD;
over the Divine Infant. Home again&#xD;
among the Persian fire-worshippers,&#xD;
a noble discontent consumed them.&#xD;
Illuminated by the sphit, how could&#xD;
they stoop to adore the brightness of&#xD;
the sun? The Iting incarnate had&#xD;
stiiiled upon them, a~nd never again&#xD;
would they make les grand obeisance.&#xD;
At last, this unrest became a supernat-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7063-00000004"/>&#xD;
rural immIusion that sent them  apart&#xD;
to .the ends of the earth, one to Eui&#xD;
rope, one to Africa, and Animasis to tei&#xD;
extreme bounds of Asia. Far at the&#xD;
*North East, he found a causeway that&#xD;
then joined the new world with the&#xD;
old, and over it, and beyond an irre-&#xD;
sistible desire impelled him, until he&#xD;
had reached the shore of the Atlantic.&#xD;
All along his route, after leaving the&#xD;
frozen waste, he had traversed a land&#xD;
of prairie and primeval forest, roamed&#xD;
over by a nomadic race, whom    he'&#xD;
wondered to find so like in feature tp&#xD;
the descendants of those- captives the&#xD;
Assyrian Kings had brought from&#xD;
Palestine ; and as his journey brought&#xD;
him near the old city by the ocean, he&#xD;
wondered more to find so many traces;&#xD;
of the religious rites his youth iad&#xD;
learned, mingled, with dim memories&#xD;
of the shadows of a purer faith which&#xD;
&#xD;
centered in the desire of 'all nations.&#xD;
His wisdom   was not long at fault.&#xD;
The more he studied the mystery the&#xD;
more sure he grew that, over the same&#xD;
Isthmus he had come, hundreds of&#xD;
years beforehad wandered portions of&#xD;
the Ten Tribes---not all lost, and ab-&#xD;
sorbed among their captors) and built&#xD;
at the South vast pyramids and great&#xD;
cities radiant with gold, and at the&#xD;
North this city of Cam, almost within&#xD;
hearing of the waves -whither he had&#xD;
journeyed. Covering many miles, and&#xD;
magnificent with pleasure domes like&#xD;
Kubla Khan decreed, it was the home&#xD;
of their princes and the head of their&#xD;
religion - every gate stood. always&#xD;
open. The waters of Tappan Zee flow&#xD;
ov r its ancient site, for then there was&#xD;
no Hudson. North of it arose in ter-&#xD;
races a highland range, and beyond&#xD;
that was a vast inland sea, which hid&#xD;

what are now the River Counties,&#xD;
above the opposing crests of BoterbergGr a&#xD;
and Grand. Sachem-.&#xD;
Here Amasis married a lady of the&#xD;
land, who dying left him Aida,and her&#xD;
he taught with earliest speech to lisp&#xD;
prayer to the son of Mary. They&#xD;
dwelt apart from the throng. On one&#xD;
of the peaks between .Cam, and the&#xD;
great Lake he had builded him a tow-&#xD;
er, whence the eye could sweep from&#xD;
Zadir to the lowest horizon, anl here&#xD;
he followed his old studies untrammel-&#xD;
ed, but not unhonored, for the M a-&#xD;
gians were the philosophers and the&#xD;
astronomers of the ages in which they&#xD;
lived. So Aida had-come to woman-&#xD;
hood without ever mingling in the&#xD;
rites of Ormuzd or the Ahriman-those&#xD;
gods of light and darkness -one of&#xD;
whom the people feared and the other&#xD;
worshipped. But the fime drew near-&#xD;
&#xD;
when the strength of her trust in her&#xD;
paternal faith should be tested - oh !&#xD;
how fearfully.&#xD;
On the Torn mountain, just outside&#xD;
the walls of Cam, stood the great Fire&#xD;
Temple, where the Arch Priest resid-&#xD;
ed, and kept the coals always glowing&#xD;
in honor of Ormuzd."- Here, too, but&#xD;
separate from the shrine, was the high&#xD;
stone altar, whereon oice in a hun-&#xD;
dred years a human sacrifice was offer-&#xD;
ed to appease Ahriman. The cAury&#xD;
had nearly rolled round, and there&#xD;
would be no escape for Aida ; for then&#xD;
the people were all gathered in the&#xD;
plain at the foot of the Torn, and each&#xD;
must witness with uplifted hand the&#xD;
horrid sight, or take the place of the&#xD;
victim. But she knew it not. Why,&#xD;
should the Magian tell her?     No&#xD;
shadow had ever fallen over her hap-&#xD;
py heart ; and the knowledge of that&#xD;

dread day and hour would have been&#xD;
more than even he could bear, had&#xD;
not the Heavens shown him strange&#xD;
prophecies of a terrible struggle in&#xD;
Nature. that gave him hope the stars&#xD;
in their course would fight against that&#xD;
bloody consumma ion. Beside,a third&#xD;
of a century h'ad gone since he did&#xD;
homage to the child, whom day by day&#xD;
he watched for in the ,strength of&#xD;
manhood to rule the Earth. . Voices&#xD;
within and without-portents above&#xD;
and mutterings below, all told him&#xD;
how near was the time, and so heo&#xD;
waited.  But - the 'cruel morning&#xD;
dawned, and all things continued as&#xD;
they were.&#xD;
Still firm in his confidence of .help,&#xD;
he knew not how, Amasis went alone&#xD;
to the place of assembly, if so be his&#xD;
warning mig t avail to stop the sacri-&#xD;
fice, and Aida . absence pass unnotic-&#xD;

'dt. It was=a gala-scoine. Thousands&#xD;
covered the plateau, first lines of mai-&#xD;
dons circling the base of the hill, then&#xD;
the princely houses ; and  then the&#xD;
common people far in the distance.&#xD;
Gorgeous in his rybes of office the&#xD;
Arch Priest sat upon the Torn, and,&#xD;
upon  the black stone altar stood a&#xD;
beautiful girl, glittering with jewels&#xD;
and a crown of golc, who had been&#xD;
chosen by lot from the fairest of the&#xD;
land, and kept in ignorance of her&#xD;
doom-proud to- be so honored, and&#xD;
smiling happily. Suddenly, the Arch&#xD;
Priest arose aid bound her hands and&#xD;
feet with silken cords, and laid her on-&#xD;
the altar, but she did not see even&#xD;
then the faggots and, 'the gleaming&#xD;
crystal club that lay beside her.&#xD;
Then among the princes, head and&#xD;
shoulders above them, strode the gray-&#xD;
haired Amasis, and told them, as often&#xD;

them cease front blood. But this they&#xD;
deemed the Magian's madness, so they&#xD;
humored it, and asked hint to show&#xD;
them this ling who was so long in&#xD;
coming to hig right!.&#xD;
Heeding not the sneer, .but pointing&#xD;
through a rift in the clouds, that till&#xD;
now had hid the sure, his reply rung&#xD;
out so all could hear and tremble:&#xD;
" Behold, the Light you Worship is&#xD;
turning to darkness !"  very glance&#xD;
Was upward and, throu h the rent pa.,&#xD;
Vilion of the dying sun, for a moment&#xD;
caught the fearful sight, ere the clouds&#xD;
lolled back again&#xD;
Rage and terror seized the multi-&#xD;
tade. They inade a wild rush toward&#xD;
the spot where he stood, calm and&#xD;
steadfast, shouting : "It is the unbe-;&#xD;
lieVer's work. Let the sacrifice go&#xD;
on !'' -But the mother of the girl, who&#xD;
&#xD;
was arrayed for slaughter, had been&#xD;
closely scanning the line of maidens,&#xD;
and now her ' shrill cry was heard&#xD;
above the tumult : "ilold! Where is&#xD;
the Magian's Daughter ?"&#xD;
Aye, where?    Up in her father's&#xD;
tower, whither the unwonted hum of&#xD;
voices had drawn her, she gazed in&#xD;
a razement on the- - thousands that&#xD;
thronged the plains below, till the&#xD;
white beard and long 'snowy locks of&#xD;
Amasis, standing like a rock amidst&#xD;
the seething mob, fixed her wandering&#xD;
eyes. When they rushed upon him,she&#xD;
flew ~down the slope and over the&#xD;
green terraces to share his danger&#xD;
Again that mother's cry : "Where&#xD;
is the Magian's Daughter ?' And the&#xD;
Arch Priest descended the stone stairs&#xD;
that led from the altar to the plain to&#xD;
stay the tumult, but before they could&#xD;
send to fetch her she leaped into the&#xD;

outstretched arms of Amasis, saying:&#xD;
" What means it, my father ?" But he&#xD;
only said: "Be strong, my daughter!'&#xD;
Then spoke the Priest : .I' Do hom-&#xD;
age,. Aida !.before Ahriman. "  " The-&#xD;
Lord I worship," she answered, "crea-&#xD;
ted both the light and the darkness."&#xD;
But he pitied her, and .felt the&#xD;
charm of her wondrous beauty and he.-&#xD;
roic, spirit. In his softest accents he&#xD;
to~d her what the day demanded, and&#xD;
how little a thing it was to escape so&#xD;
dire a penalty. Thel effort was vain.&#xD;
Again he addressed her aloud:  " Do&#xD;
homage, Aida ! or take her place -who&#xD;
waits to be offered."&#xD;
And Amasis whispered : "Be strong,&#xD;
my daughter."   Clear were the tones&#xD;
in which- her answer came: "The&#xD;
Lord, I worship can raise me from&#xD;
the dead.". At that the people cried&#xD;
out with the roar, of the raging sea&#xD;
&#xD;
"To the altar with the Magian's&#xD;
daughter."&#xD;
Sadly the Arch Priest bore her up&#xD;
the mountain, and Amasis followed up&#xD;
the stone steps, down which ere long&#xD;
sprang the unbound maiden, jeweled&#xD;
and crowned and, shuddering at the&#xD;
fate she fled from, to. join her kind-&#xD;
red.&#xD;
In her stead lay Aida, elad in her&#xD;
simple robe of white, with clasped&#xD;
hands, and still as the picture of a&#xD;
saiut. The Priest bound her not, for&#xD;
his pity had grown to love, and he&#xD;
was determined to save her even then,&#xD;
though her glazing eyes beheld him&#xD;
standing by her side with the instru-&#xD;
inent of death upraised and waiting&#xD;
the re-appearance of the sun. But f r&#xD;
him and his heathen clan it wo d&#xD;
never shine again.&#xD;

throwing strange unnatural hues on&#xD;
all things-on .the grass, and the sky&#xD;
and the row silent populace, who each&#xD;
looked on the other's face affrighted.&#xD;
The air was heavy and unstirred save&#xD;
by puffs of stifling vapor. The, very&#xD;
ground wavered, and from everywhere&#xD;
came rumbling echoes, as of chariots&#xD;
-thundering over rock-ribbed moun-&#xD;
tains, and dashing together above the&#xD;
banded stars.&#xD;
Then   from  the  Torn,  Amasis&#xD;
stretched out his arm toward the brok-&#xD;
en clouds, and cried aloud: "The&#xD;
King cometh!" and lo.! there in the&#xD;
zenith hung the sun, black and form-&#xD;
lese. The crowd saw, and crouched,&#xD;

and darkness hfrridly iemmingled.&#xD;

out of the clouds and slew him ; and&#xD;
the hill was split in twain, and the fire&#xD;
temple crashed down the chasm that&#xD;
ran northward to the Lake and south-&#xD;
ward to the Atlantic.   The panic&#xD;
stricken crowd fought for re -in to&#xD;
flee, parents dreading down their chil-&#xD;
dren, but the chasm widened, the&#xD;
ground sunk beneath them, the pent&#xD;
up waters broke through the old time.&#xD;
barriers, and swept over the city of&#xD;
Cam, along the granite-hewn Pali-&#xD;
sades the earthquake had builded, on&#xD;
to the astonished ocean. Amasis on-&#xD;
ly survived, kneeling on the Torn&#xD;
mountain beside the form of his dead&#xD;
daughter, while the   evening sun&#xD;
threw its wonted rays orer a changed&#xD;
-land and a new river. On the night&#xD;
of the second day, weary with watch-&#xD;
ing, the old man slumbered, but when&#xD;
the dawn came Aida waked him, and&#xD;
&#xD;
made this answer to his waking eyes:&#xD;
"  y spirit was afar where all the&#xD;
worlds rolled by in glory, save our&#xD;
earth that reeled through space black&#xD;
and monstrous. Then a glare of con&#xD;
tral fires, leaping an instant through&#xD;
her shattered crust, showed me a rab-&#xD;
ble throng howling round a cross&#xD;
whereon hung nailed our King."&#xD;
The old man wept. "He has risen,"&#xD;
she exultingly exclaimed, as if she&#xD;
caught a str in of seraphic song. "Go&#xD;
hence, my fa:he', and tell men now&#xD;
sacrifice is sacrilege, but let me stay&#xD;
with the Angels."&#xD;
And so he left her, retracing his&#xD;
way to the Pacific. But the cause..&#xD;
way was gone. The earthquake -had&#xD;
sunk the Isthmus and nnlinked the&#xD;
Hemisphere, that the new world might&#xD;
not bear the guilt of the old. Then he&#xD;
journeyed  southward to the   gold-&#xD;

Together they would urge their po-&#xD;
nies along the mountain road, or&#xD;
climb South Beacon- from whence four&#xD;
states help make the landscape; but&#xD;
their favorite haunt was her arbor on&#xD;
the river bank, where, when too late&#xD;
to read, they could gaze silently n&#xD;
the reflected radiance of the hill-&#xD;
crowned village opposite, or&#xD;
The moving lights that hung from the spars,&#xD;
And mingled below with the shadows of stars.&#xD;
So these summer days rolled by&#xD;
as the others had done, with never&#xD;
a word of betrothal spoken, yet Guert&#xD;
Brickerhoff looked forward to; his&#xD;
nearly reached majority, when he&#xD;
would take her to his home a willing&#xD;
bride. Proud of the'homage paid her&#xD;
by Paul Vernon, his noble nature had&#xD;
no room for a jealous thought, and&#xD;
though   acknowledging superior ac-&#xD;

Perhaps .his mistress would have pre-&#xD;

times, not an angel but a woman; she&#xD;
could not . resist the temptation to&#xD;
playful coquetry ; and the Rector's&#xD;
eyes brightened at a fancied interest,&#xD;
in his eloquence over what she be-&#xD;

wit and humor. Neither lover having&#xD;
declared himself, of course, she rea-&#xD;

Just then contrasting strangely with-&#xD;
the whiteness all around appeared the&#xD;
sable face of Quawm,au ancient servitor&#xD;
who .had come out to care for the&#xD;
horses.&#xD;
" Will Massa Brinkerhoff have the&#xD;
harness off ?" he whispered through&#xD;
his gleaming ivories,&#xD;
"No, Quawm! only throw their&#xD;
their blankets on, we will start in a&#xD;

go too. In   multitude of escorts&#xD;

shook his head as they entered the&#xD;
presence of the object of their idola'&#xD;
story, whom they found gloved and&#xD;
bonneted, glowing with health and&#xD;
gleeful over her long talked of sleigh&#xD;
ride " up tp the Paltz."_&#xD;
&#xD;
No one hinted to her a word of dan-&#xD;

the bear-skin robe around her, feet be-&#xD;

had been making mysterious signs to&#xD;
Guert, .broke out with, ' : "Massa&#xD;

Down the gravelly road along the&#xD;
beach he watched them; then out on&#xD;
the river till far in the North, the&#xD;
speck vanished from the ice plain.&#xD;
Wearily passed that long remember--&#xD;
ed day. Some weird presence seemed&#xD;
warning him of peril. In vain would&#xD;
he check the thought as folly, as he&#xD;
lay down one book to take up another.&#xD;
His favorite authors had lost th4ir&#xD;
charms, for his heart was away to the&#xD;
northward where Guert was pressing&#xD;
his suit at last with words of open&#xD;
frankness, and his fair companion&#xD;
studying' how the could retain her&#xD;
freedom yet a little longer. A suspiq&#xD;
eion that it might be so, did not tend&#xD;
to quiet Paul's restlessness. The last&#xD;
No. of, Coleman's Evening Post, only .&#xD;
four days old, lay teinptingly on his&#xD;
table; but even this could not.fix his&#xD;
wandering fancies till his roaming eye&#xD;

&#xD;
4.- f&#xD;
&#xD;
fastened greedily oil a little item that&#xD;
spoke of " much floating ice in the&#xD;
North River, just above the city."--&#xD;
Then he blamed himself for his former&#xD;
lingering and uncertain mode of gain-&#xD;
ing the hand of her he loved so long ;&#xD;
else he might have had the right to have&#xD;
dissuaded her from the fascinating ride,&#xD;
and kept her to himself to-day.&#xD;
Ever and anon turning his wistful&#xD;
glances where his thoughts were, in&#xD;
- the hops that they might, have taken&#xD;
counsel of their fears, and turned&#xD;
back before their journey's end ; at&#xD;
last he mounted his horse to ride away-&#xD;
from his anxiety.  But a few miles&#xD;
down the Breakneck road he saw and&#xD;
heard enough to make him hasten&#xD;
home and take "to his skates, if so, he&#xD;
might meet them miles above on their&#xD;
return, and warn Guert off the river.&#xD;
Below he could hear the low roar and&#xD;

dull crashing of the channel ice, and&#xD;
even where he skated the places that&#xD;
had yesterday been only dangerous,&#xD;
*     were now black pools, and as far as&#xD;
he, could see, there were ominous fis-&#xD;
sures crossing and re-crossing each.&#xD;
other. But he pressed on till the twi&#xD;
light had.,gone. The moon would not&#xD;
rise in an hour. His peril was more&#xD;
imminent than theirs, and only the&#xD;
thought, that she might be lost whom&#xD;
he could have saved, and the joy of&#xD;
his life go out forever, kept him stead-&#xD;
ily on his course-&#xD;
"Who falls from all he knows of bliss&#xD;
Cares not into what abyss."&#xD;
And well was it for -the returning&#xD;
travellers that Paul Vernon kept on.&#xD;
The moonlight, when it came, did not&#xD;
discover to his searching gaze, a soul&#xD;
moving over the wide expanse ; but&#xD;
presently a tinkling sound was borne&#xD;
&#xD;
on thy rising wind. Ile listened.-&#xD;
Loader floated their merry jingling,&#xD;
and thea around a beetling headlaud&#xD;
that had hid then, at full trot dashed&#xD;
the unsuspecting greys. He shouted,&#xD;
though he knew their master could&#xD;
not hear him, and when he did they&#xD;
were almost upon him.&#xD;
"Why Dominie Vernon ! as I live,&#xD;
cried Guert " where are you going ?&#xD;
where have you been ? you look as&#xD;
pale as a ghostin the moonlight."&#xD;
"You would be pale too, Guert&#xD;
l3rickerhoff, if you had been as 'near&#xD;
the bitterness of death as I have.-&#xD;
Thank God ! I am in time to hope&#xD;
to save you Mary."&#xD;
" Oh, Mr. Vernon, is it so bad?"&#xD;
replied she, " get is the sleigh and tell&#xD;
us what you mean. Stop Guert !" the&#xD;
greys stood a moment.&#xD;
" No. I will noi add my weight,"&#xD;

Laid the Rector; "BErinkerhoffi! you&#xD;

to some point where    yQu can go&#xD;
ashore."&#xD;
" Well that is some distance, -you&#xD;
had better get in," said Guert, who&#xD;
was always last to own a risk. -&#xD;
No, no, hasten!" almost angrily&#xD;
cried Vernon, "I will pilot you. The&#xD;
river is open below the highlands, and&#xD;
a great wall .of broken ice was piled-&#xD;
up there this afternoon, and if that&#xD;
gives way when the tide turns, the&#xD;
whole mass will move from Peliham&#xD;
Cove; if it has not already-"&#xD;
Away sprang the horses in Vernon's&#xD;
vake, whose fears added wings to his&#xD;
flight. But the youth and "Maiden were&#xD;
happy still ; p riect love) casteth out&#xD;
fear; only an hour heforo they had given&#xD;
themselves to each other for all time and&#xD;
.for ever. . But slowly and surely as&#xD;
&#xD;
the. morn mounted the sky, the fateful&#xD;
crisis was approaching them, and when&#xD;
miles below' they saw  the glitter of&#xD;
its beams, their short dream   Avaw&#xD;
rudely br.;ken. It could not be the&#xD;
ice they said that shone so, for on it&#xD;
there was snow. No, it must be a&#xD;
sheet of water where the ice had gone&#xD;
out or sunk suddenly, and then the&#xD;
full, meaning of Paul's warning burst&#xD;
upon them.&#xD;
The strange celebrity with w hieh&#xD;
nature works this change on her great&#xD;
highway must be seen to be realized ;&#xD;
one may pass over the solid bridge at&#xD;
night, where on the morrow ho can-&#xD;
not walk but by a miracle.&#xD;
On flew their guide ; on sped the&#xD;
greys as if conscious that the race&#xD;
was for life. Already the dim o tline&#xD;
of the shore, where they coil4 land,&#xD;
was visible. They could. aLmost count&#xD;

k&#xD;
&#xD;
the scattered house lights, that never&#xD;
before had looked more welcome ;&#xD;
when suddenly a mighty goar smote&#xD;
their ears, and turning instinctively,&#xD;
they saw a, fast widening line behind&#xD;
them, winding like a huge serpent,&#xD;
black nnd glittering to the northwards&#xD;
The channel. ice had given why above&#xD;
and beside theme&#xD;
But they were on the eastern flats;&#xD;
and now heading for the shore over&#xD;
uglier cracks than  Guert had   ever&#xD;
tempted, he hoped to reach it-before&#xD;
the quivering ijiass swing loose from&#xD;
its moorings. All at once, the horses;&#xD;
with a neigh of fright, broke from his&#xD;
control.  The ice field was moving,&#xD;
aad some subtle sense told them what&#xD;
in ended. Before them was a fissure&#xD;
wider than could be leapt ver, and&#xD;
growing every moment'&#xD;
Quick to see the new peril, Paul&#xD;
&#xD;
grasped the bit as they rushed by, and&#xD;
hung on desperately till Guert had&#xD;
iime to. cut the traces ; then let them&#xD;
plunge untrammelled into the yawning&#xD;
gulf, and take their chance for life.&#xD;
The young men watched them&#xD;
struggle over to the firmer ice, but&#xD;
whether they made sure their foot-&#xD;
ing, they cQuld not tell, through the&#xD;
dim increasing distance. Wider grew&#xD;
the chasm!. Their last faint hope of&#xD;
being, carried against some jutting&#xD;
point, was lost. The tide had changed.&#xD;
It was running out, and bearing them&#xD;
downward:indeed, but further from the&#xD;
shore. The. noie of the nyassive cakes&#xD;
grinding, against each other grew ter-&#xD;
rible. Their frail float was fast -fail-&#xD;
ing. Great pieces broke ofd it above&#xD;
and below; and. when they a4 reach-&#xD;
ed the bay, wind aid  tide impelling,&#xD;
it-was so small they could see the ire&#xD;

It&#xD;
*1&#xD;
z&#xD;
&#xD;
38&#xD;
heaving, crashing, whirling around&#xD;
them.&#xD;
So they floated, looking death in the&#xD;
. face, till opposite the home of Mary&#xD;
Pell. Its peace so near her, and yet&#xD;
so far ; she, who had  been  calm&#xD;
through all, sobbed wildly, stretching&#xD;
out her hands toward that lone light&#xD;
which waited for her, and dal!ing for&#xD;
some one to come. None could hear,&#xD;
and no boat could have lived to reach&#xD;
them through that seething surge.-&#xD;
But the deep voice of Vernon reciting&#xD;
from the Litany  "And from sudden&#xD;
death, good Lord deliver u's," recalled&#xD;
her; and to him she spoke:&#xD;
" Forgive me, Paul! I could not&#xD;
help loving Guert more than you,&#xD;
though I hardly knew it till to-day.-&#xD;
Pardon me the sorrow."&#xD;
"Peace to you Mary!" said the Rec-&#xD;
tor slowly, " Guert has told me what&#xD;
&#xD;
39&#xD;
my own heart would feign deny. And&#xD;
to show you I forgive, let me, as he&#xD;
wishes unite you with holy words-&#xD;
not till death do you part-but that&#xD;
sinking in each others arms you may&#xD;
awake one."&#xD;
And'it' was done.&#xD;
Then all was calm again throughout&#xD;
the little company that seemed to stand&#xD;
in the very shadow of doom.    The&#xD;
beauty of the, solemn rite had with-&#xD;
drawn their minds from their awful&#xD;
surroundings, and  they   felt new&#xD;
strength to die.&#xD;
Paul was the first to . reak the short&#xD;
silence.  "took ! what is that dark&#xD;
spot ahead ?"&#xD;
"A pile of rock-almost in the mid-&#xD;
die of the river," Guert replied, ".and&#xD;
it will either save or ruin us." True,&#xD;
there it lay directly in their course,&#xD;
and would either hatter their brittle&#xD;

should she not ? Those were her hal-&#xD;

recollections they furnish ! Let her&#xD;
think  that ' the sfta' shone brighter&#xD;
then, that the men were more manly&#xD;
then, and the beautiful of that time&#xD;
far outrivalled the fair ones of this.&#xD;
Remember that then she was young&#xD;

purest of the pure, Washington him-.&#xD;

Only this one of her reminiscences,&#xD;
relating to the Newburgh    letters,&#xD;
comes back to me now.&#xD;
.I never, mever saw the General&#xD;
more moyed in spirit, said she, though&#xD;
in more fitting wordsthan once when I&#xD;
happened on a visit at the house of a&#xD;
leading patriot with whom he was&#xD;
most intimate. It was when the ar-&#xD;
my lay in-camy near New Windsor, a&#xD;
few miles above West Point. Prelimi-&#xD;
nagryterms of peace had bee settled,&#xD;
and the situation of many of the offi-&#xD;
cers was desperateo   The empty,&#xD;
promises of Congress could not replace&#xD;
their expended patrimonies, and they&#xD;
felt that;to be set adrift on the world,&#xD;
penniless, was hardly what their seven&#xD;
years service to the Republic merited.&#xD;
&#xD;
49&#xD;
In the midst of the tinder some un-&#xD;
known hand hulled a fire brand-a let-&#xD;
ter eloquent enough for Junids to have&#xD;
written, and insiduous enough to have&#xD;
emanated from the club of the Jaco-&#xD;
bins. Simultaneously -came a call&#xD;
for them to meet at the Temple. This&#xD;
was- a building the General, who had&#xD;
been made a Mason at Morristown,&#xD;
erected to serve the double purpose pf&#xD;
a church for the army, and a lodge-&#xD;
room for the fraternity of officers.&#xD;
I know Masonry has been a terror to&#xD;
this generation, but the favor he felt&#xD;
for it has always been for me its best&#xD;
defence. Once, I remember, a poor&#xD;
wretched, ragged man came to our&#xD;
house and after a private interview&#xD;
with my brother, went away well clad,&#xD;
and with a purse of gold in his pocket.&#xD;
No one told me this was Masonry, but&#xD;
outside its influence strangers do not&#xD;

-           All this is wandering from the letter&#xD;
the General read from.    When he&#xD;
came to. the passage where the writer&#xD;
urges his brother officers to tell Con-&#xD;
gress "that in any event the army has&#xD;
its alternative. If peace, nothing shall&#xD;
separate you from your arms but death;&#xD;
if war, that courting the auspices and&#xD;
inviting the directions of, your illus-&#xD;

unsettled country, smile in your turn&#xD;
and mock when their fear cometh,"&#xD;
he paused.   What."! he exclaimed,&#xD;
pacing the floor "must this imprudent&#xD;
schemer have me to head his conspira-&#xD;
cy ?" Then mastering his indignation&#xD;
he added, "If there is to be one, per-&#xD;
hays it is better that I should !"&#xD;
K                 Immediately a general order issued&#xD;
which had the effect of defering the&#xD;
appointed meeting at the Temple four&#xD;

Haste Orange, to the. rescue ! Too&#xD;

Why did they kill him?  Why do&#xD;
the wild horses of the' prairie gtow&#xD;

And all were drifting on to ruin till&#xD;

The hour was full of danger.-&#xD;
Kings and priests were allied to crush&#xD;

marching on its capital, and the ban-&#xD;

red shadow before them.     But the&#xD;
man for the, hour had come. His&#xD;
strong heart kept beat with the gran-&#xD;

only ally; and after it had beaten off&#xD;
the English ships, he called it to his aid,&#xD;
till it flowed over half the provinces&#xD;
and helped defend the rest, And where&#xD;
this wall of water. did not reach he&#xD;
built a wall of patriotic hearts. The&#xD;
masses caught his spirit. The Burgh-&#xD;
ers knew his power. Old men told&#xD;
how his sires had broken off their&#xD;
necks the cruel yoke of Spain, and&#xD;

All the world deemed the contest&#xD;
hopeless, but staking'his honor, rank&#xD;
and life upon the issue, with the bloom&#xD;
of youth upon his cheek, and ancestral&#xD;
glories clustering thick about his name,&#xD;
he strode into the front ranks of war.&#xD;
Louis the Great, and the flower of the&#xD;
French chivalry were there, but he&#xD;
held them  at bay.  Nor could the&#xD;
bribe of a crown tempt him, nor the&#xD;
gigantic power of France drive him&#xD;
from the stand he had taken, as long&#xD;
as there remained a ditch to die in.-&#xD;
Thus he battled on along for weary&#xD;
years,. untiLthe Germanic States, be-&#xD;
coming conscious of their danger, one&#xD;
by one wheeled into line, and came up&#xD;
to the help of the free against the&#xD;
mighty, and when the tide of invasion&#xD;
rolled back, there stood unshaken&#xD;
and unbroken, those two strong pillars&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

of civilization, the Nationality of Hol-&#xD;
land and the Protestant faith.&#xD;
On that height of glory he might&#xD;
willingly have died. A life of eight&#xD;

lime achievement would have towered&#xD;
above all human lives before, and all&#xD;

fame brightens in th e gaze of humani-&#xD;

He was the type of the coming Wash-&#xD;

Massey, she is out visiting too," chimed&#xD;
in her twin sister Vinia; "and we are&#xD;

preceded a little way, to announce with&#xD;
the eagerness .of bearers of glad tid.&#xD;

point of green : low willows skirting&#xD;
the Cove above, where the flood tide&#xD;
kissed tlfs roots and then fell.back&#xD;
abashed ; with the Eternal Hills in the&#xD;
back-ground, and in front, the wide ex-&#xD;

suggested Bute, who still thought of&#xD;
them as schooA-girls he could hardly&#xD;
ever tell apart, and was even now puz-&#xD;
A1ing over a choice of charms and iden-&#xD;

on both sides and a river view from&#xD;

fort, in which the windows have wide&#xD;
recesses. Into these cushioned alcoves&#xD;
the young men flung themselves, and&#xD;
read and dozed away the afternoon till&#xD;
the dressing bell roused them to meet&#xD;
the family, who welcomed them with&#xD;
the  unaffected  cordiality of Auld&#xD;
Lang Syne.&#xD;
'The buoyant fortnight that followed,&#xD;
though crowded with-incident, seemed&#xD;
the shortest of their lives. The Hours&#xD;

loping hoofs, as they tempted the nar&#xD;
row causeway between Breakneck and&#xD;
the river. One night it would be mu^&#xD;
sic on the water, and the next some&#xD;
social- gathering where every other&#xD;
guest rejoiced in the "Van" of the Hol&#xD;
landers. But oftener they would row&#xD;
round the Point for an angle in the&#xD;
Fishkill, or stroll among the cedars of&#xD;
Presquile to listen " what the waves&#xD;
were- saying,"&#xD;
Their elders planned, and consider-&#xD;
ately left them to execute, With hearts&#xD;
untrammeled, such intimacy could not-&#xD;
go on for ever--but it was always the&#xD;
same partie caree, and the charms and&#xD;
identities of the twins were ever coma&#xD;
mingling and confusing. The young&#xD;
men we not sure both1i d not made&#xD;

was yet more misty.       "Were either&#xD;
dear charmer away !" then Cave or&#xD;
Bate would     have been    away   along&#xD;
with the charmer; but the sisters were&#xD;
inseparable.&#xD;
One evening the couples, as far&#xD;
apart as they could get, were leaning&#xD;
against the snowy walls of the piazza,&#xD;
watching the glassy Bay mirror back&#xD;
the moon, when Bute broke out with :&#xD;
0, scenes there are of beauty in this desert&#xD;
world-of ours,&#xD;
Oases-like, all redolent of fountains and of flow-&#xD;
ers!f&#xD;
Where the lonely heart forgetting o'er its exiled lot&#xD;
to grieve&#xD;
In their lovely presence findeth an Eden and an&#xD;
Eve.&#xD;
" Really, Mr. Eveleth ! that verse&#xD;
seems to fascinate you.    It's only the&#xD;
second time you have whispered it to&#xD;
me to-night !" said Vinia.&#xD;
" Oh !" blundered Bute, "I thought&#xD;
it was your sister"&#xD;

"Indeed! Your flattery is so general&#xD;

CaveColton could not help hearing,&#xD;
and making a pQint:&#xD;
Say, Bute ! it never struck me&#xD;
before how lucky Adam was in not -&#xD;
having two Eves to choose from in&#xD;
Paradise.&#xD;
But the girls who had no such&#xD;
trouble, pondered these things in their&#xD;
hearts.&#xD;
So 'autumn days swept by, and the&#xD;
visit they had lengthened,. to escort&#xD;
Tavia and Vinia to New York, ended&#xD;
without a declaration, save what. they&#xD;
made to each other of finding their&#xD;
fate on the voyage. Sloops were yet&#xD;
the common carriers of the time, and&#xD;
Cap'n Boam was. never prouder of&#xD;
Periauga than when it carried the&#xD;
partie earree out to the "Hope" that lay&#xD;
at anchor off the Bar,-aw ng ac txurn&#xD;

of the tide, or a whiff of tho\wind,&#xD;
till after sunset.&#xD;
Leaning over the taffrail in the&#xD;
moonlight, as the bounding bark dash-&#xD;
ed over the mountain shadows, and&#xD;
almost alone on deck, each felt the&#xD;
day of decision had come and gaily&#xD;
accepted the position.  Their tones&#xD;
lowered perceptibly and by degrees&#xD;
the pairs of chairs instinctively separ-&#xD;
ated.  Bute's proposal was on his&#xD;
tongue and Tavia seemed ready for&#xD;
the question, when the Master sang&#xD;
out to the helmsman: "How far down&#xD;
are we ?"&#xD;
" St. Anthony's Nose, sir !"&#xD;
The sight 'of the monster by moon-&#xD;
light was too rare to be missed, and&#xD;
woman's curiosity broke up each tete&#xD;
.a tee, to -gaze upon the wonderful&#xD;
mountain, on whose misshapen side&#xD;
that strange irregularity was carved by&#xD;

" Quite a prominent feature !" Cave&#xD;
remarked.&#xD;
"And do look ! Mr. Colton,".cried&#xD;
Tavia, "at that twig growing down&#xD;
where his chin ought to be."&#xD;
" Rather to  Frenchy for a Saint's&#xD;
beard-goate    gh !"&#xD;
But while they were cracking their&#xD;
jokes on the rock, a bend in the river,&#xD;
dispelled the allusion, and Bute walk-&#xD;
ed away with number nine, beginning&#xD;
.again the same strain he~had just left&#xD;
off with number eight, till he caught,&#xD;
himself in. time to change' the subject,-&#xD;
by hinting that it was past their," hour&#xD;
for retiring."  The. opportunity, thus&#xD;
lest,' did notuecur on:the- passage. A&#xD;
fair wind all next day carried them&#xD;
past the Palisades, and late in the af-&#xD;
ternoon  the ;young .nn left their&#xD;
&#xD;
tharges at the house of, the friend they&#xD;
had come to visit, on St. John's Park,&#xD;
as free as ever.&#xD;
fThe "Lady of the Lake" was.the&#xD;
play of the period, and on the'evening&#xD;
after, lute happened to take Vinia and&#xD;
Cave the other,; wherein the the&#xD;
"Lady" was so large, and the skiff so&#xD;
little, the sisters were not the only ones&#xD;
in the old Chatham Theatre who shud-&#xD;
dered at the consequences.   Home&#xD;
again, in their room that overlooked&#xD;
the inchoate Park, they were wonder-&#xD;
ing if their knights would get out of&#xD;
their maze, and to their satisfaction;&#xD;
while at the City Hotel the knights were&#xD;
sketching a new campaign entirely.&#xD;
" By  the bye ! Colton !. did you&#xD;
earry the day with Miss Vinia ?" asked&#xD;
Bute, after they had pulled the play-&#xD;
ers' costumes .to 'pieces.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7063-00000039"/>&#xD;
76&#xD;
" I should, had not St. Anthony&#xD;
flanked us at the crisis," Cave replied,&#xD;
who suspected more than he knew."&#xD;
"You may well say 'us,' ha ! ha !"&#xD;
laughed Bute.&#xD;
- "Have you determined which num-&#xD;
ber to take, Eveleth ?"&#xD;
"I thought I had till last night."&#xD;
"So did I," pointedly replied Cave,&#xD;
jumping up to light an Havannah, and,&#xD;
hide his blushes.&#xD;
" My plan is," suggested Bute, "to&#xD;
return with then to-morruw, and at&#xD;
sight of the Nose, ask the gone that&#xD;
happens to be with us,, instanter"&#xD;
"So be it! lHope the name is not&#xD;
ominous of the answers we'll get."&#xD;
"After what has passed I should&#xD;
not wonder if both refused us !" :&#xD;
" ela depend on which one we ask."&#xD;
" We must follow our own hearts,"&#xD;
said Bute, "but whose knows ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" St. Anthony's, sir !"  And so they&#xD;
- settled it, little thinking what a revenge&#xD;
for their jests the saint was going to&#xD;
have when they would read their fate&#xD;
by lightning.&#xD;
Storm and headwinds so delayed the&#xD;
upward trip, that in the third day's&#xD;
twilight the sloop lay by for the night&#xD;
as her four passengers thought, below&#xD;
the highlands. But after midnight&#xD;
the wind shifted, and spite of their&#xD;
lack of ballast, and the warnings of&#xD;
the helmsman, the venturesome master&#xD;
weighed anchor.&#xD;
Through the perils of that winding&#xD;
gorge, where at every turn the moun-&#xD;
tains make a new channel for the wind&#xD;
and the water, the vessel had nearly&#xD;
passed, when all at once strange noises&#xD;
overhead roused Cave and Bute from&#xD;
their slumber. Climbing   up  with&#xD;
coats in hand, they leaped into tho&#xD;

Then a flash- from  the clouds showed&#xD;
them the man, whose place was the&#xD;
tiller, knocked overboard and swims&#xD;
ming for the shore, and the pale nas-&#xD;
ter with his axe, on deck alone, by the&#xD;
great white sheet that strained and&#xD;
strugged for release.&#xD;
The next moment they were all in&#xD;
the water, with the spread sail undei&#xD;
them like a hammock. The " Hope '&#xD;
had capsized.  The pent up winds&#xD;
came pouring. through the narrows,&#xD;
an4 there she lay without the slimmest&#xD;
hope of righting. Bt the ,master&#xD;
slinging to his ax,), as if it Were a life&#xD;
preserver, clambered up on the side,&#xD;
and lifted them out of the reach of&#xD;
the waves, to take their chances with&#xD;
the vessel'&#xD;
&#xD;
' All this time the, sisters were in the&#xD;
after cabin, and their angels had taken&#xD;
their souls -for a little while, when the&#xD;
dream changed to falhng down, down,&#xD;
down, till they awoke in terror, stand-&#xD;
ing on the wall of their state room.-~&#xD;
Through the chinks of the door under&#xD;
their feet, that was locked on the out-&#xD;
side, the water came flowing in, and&#xD;
they could hear it surging through the&#xD;
hold. Butthey could see nothing, and&#xD;
.half awake, could not tell in their&#xD;
fright, whether their side of the sloop&#xD;
was the upper or under. Shut in, and&#xD;
shrieking aloud'from that dark coffin ;&#xD;
even in those perilous moments Vinia&#xD;
noticed Tavia called on Bute to save&#xD;
her, and it made her glad as she&#xD;
thought they would die as they had&#xD;
lived, without a cloud between their&#xD;
spirits.. So clasped in each others&#xD;
arms, and praying, silently they waited.&#xD;

Then over their heads rolled a noise&#xD;
thatvwas not thunder. They listened,&#xD;
and catching the sound of heavy strokes&#xD;
knew eome some one was cutting them&#xD;
out of ,their prison. Steadily fell the&#xD;
axe, every time with a clearer ring,&#xD;
till the cool air rushed in and told them&#xD;
they were rescued from that horror.&#xD;
Ere long strong arms lifted them out&#xD;
. into the grateful' gloom, and . manly&#xD;
tones -cheered them  back to hopeful-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
The wreck was sinking slowly and&#xD;
the small boat hadbeen swept away, but.&#xD;
the river was calm again and daylight&#xD;
not far distant. Wrapped in shawls and&#xD;
blankets, Tavialet Bute support her, and&#xD;
Vinia the other, as they sat on the ves-&#xD;
sol's side, wishing for the morning.--&#xD;
So floating up with the tide and look-&#xD;
ing shoreward, suddenly with a crash&#xD;
and a roar the sky was lit for a mo-&#xD;

ment, and there right before them&#xD;
towered the frowning front of St. An-&#xD;
thony. Then the.young men remem-&#xD;
bered their strange compact, but there&#xD;
was no need. That hour of peril had&#xD;
stilled all doubts and fears forever.&#xD;
With the dawn came the welcome&#xD;
sight of"Perryauger" bearing down up-&#xD;
on them from the northward. The&#xD;
escaped boatman had given the alarm,&#xD;
and fearing the worstCapt'n Boan.and&#xD;
Massey, who would come along, apt&#xD;
proached the wreck. When they saw&#xD;
the "Hope's" company still afloat the&#xD;
hills  resounded  with  their loud&#xD;
huzzas, and Massey hugged all that&#xD;
came aboard indiscriminately.&#xD;
"Number eight and number nine&#xD;

O'er the ctmbling castle turrets flocks of shrieking&#xD;
sea gulls fly,                       d,&#xD;
And the Clan Macleod is scattered save their dead,&#xD;
who silent lie&#xD;
Around Dunvegan.&#xD;
Once the chieftain of the islands, reigned the&#xD;
mighty Ian More,&#xD;
With a ulls head, fierce and gory for the crest his&#xD;
helmet bore,&#xD;
And as malty stalwart clansnian, as the trees that&#xD;
guard the bhore&#xD;
Along Dunvegan.&#xD;
While the silken flag above them, which the fairies'&#xD;
fingers wove,&#xD;
From the colors of the heather and the foliage of&#xD;
the grove,&#xD;
Made their numbers seem to foeman thrice as&#xD;
many when they strove&#xD;
Far from Dunvegan.&#xD;
On its warp and woof of.beauty, HOLD 'AST, we e&#xD;
the words inwrought;&#xD;
:And amid the wars of ages-where e'er Highlander&#xD;
have fought,&#xD;
Memory of that Gaelic banner gave them valor,&#xD;
when they thought&#xD;
Of old Dunvegan.&#xD;
I have heard a tragic legend, of those mad, tempes-&#xD;
tou s times,&#xD;
Love and gngea nee strangely mingled, fitter for&#xD;

And a measure more heroic than these easy flowing&#xD;

Long the Lairds of Igg had nestled in their craggy&#xD;
- belted Isle&#xD;
Caring naught for prince or pirate, from the world&#xD;
Eahfall many a mile,&#xD;
Each new generation holding prouder, bitterer hate&#xD;
the while         Against Dunvegan,&#xD;
' But a beam of light and beauty came to earth with&#xD;
Fantasole-*&#xD;
Only heir and only daughter, singing, swinging Ori-&#xD;
ole-&#xD;
And her lather's brow grew brighter, like the hills,&#xD;
when shadows roll    Over Dunvegan.&#xD;
Music floating o'er the' water, laughter dying. in a&#xD;
sigh,&#xD;
Falling from the rocks above him as he rowed his&#xD;
curra nigh&#xD;
Where she sang, one day bewildered Alexatder&#xD;
Prince of Skye,&#xD;
Aid of Dunvegan.&#xD;
Won, he waited. Down a pathway leading to the&#xD;
ocean strand,&#xD;
Tripped the maide1w, with her tresses, golden tinted,&#xD;
in her hand,&#xD;
And her great eyes looking thro' the hazy distance&#xD;
toward the land&#xD;
Where stood Dunvegan.&#xD;
So upon the narrow causeway Fantole stood&#xD;
dreamily ,&#xD;
Heedless of the tide returning, and the wild re-&#xD;
morseless sea,&#xD;
Till it swept netween her Island, and where still&#xD;
in fancy, she&#xD;
Was at Dunvegan.&#xD;
Turning then her glances shoreward, pale with fear&#xD;
.her head she bowed ;&#xD;
"Save me ! Save me I or I perish," half in prayer&#xD;
she shrieked; and loud&#xD;
*In the Gaelic, Fainte-a-Solus. A Sunbeam&#xD;
&#xD;
85&#xD;
'Aye, my lady! I will save you"' shouted back the&#xD;
young Macleod&#xD;
Prince of Dunvegan.&#xD;
Spun his skiff thro' rocks and surges; to her home&#xD;
it bore her faint,&#xD;
Hair al streaming-hands close clasping--like the&#xD;
picture of a saint ;&#xD;
But the look with whieh her father spake the&#xD;
words, 0, who can paint?&#xD;
" Welcome, Dunvegan I"&#xD;
'Twas not long ere Alexander to the Isle of Igg&#xD;
again,&#xD;
Came a-wooing, in a grander state, with oars six-&#xD;
teen and men ;&#xD;
Never heart beat more chivalric, nor shone sun&#xD;
more bright than when&#xD;
He left Dunvegan.&#xD;
Still the old Laird was so courtly-better had he&#xD;
been as trite !&#xD;
And the best cheer of the castle gave him, till the&#xD;
day was through-&#xD;
Fantasole--and smiling called bcr, when at eve&#xD;
they said adieu,&#xD;
"Queen of Dunvegan"&#xD;
Never rose a wraith to warn him, with his heart so&#xD;
o    free from guile,&#xD;
H~ow the spirit of betrayal entered into Igg the&#xD;
while,&#xD;
Come again, incarnate lurking underneath the kiss&#xD;
and smile.&#xD;
Beware ! Dunvegan. -&#xD;
On the shore his boat lay oarless, every sailor firm.&#xD;
ly bound,&#xD;
And the old Laird set his helpless guest adrift upon&#xD;
the sound ;&#xD;
So all night and day they floated on the ocean,&#xD;
round and round.&#xD;
Their home, Dunvegan.&#xD;

Famished, feverish, fainting, frozen, life was&#xD;
one long agony;&#xD;
And the only prayer they uttered was for death to&#xD;
set them free,&#xD;
But a mercy sent them saviours-humble fishers&#xD;
on the sea&#xD;
From out Dunvegan.&#xD;
Shouts, and then a cry for vengeance. roused from&#xD;
slumber Ian More ;&#xD;
Quick his cross, with blood besprinked, everywhere&#xD;
the heralds bore,&#xD;
Till its lurid burning lighted xv ilder faces than the&#xD;
shore&#xD;
Above Dunvegan.&#xD;
Warriors, gathered in their Tartans,-redder signals&#xD;
longed to see,&#xD;
Wavelike, raging round the castle, till went forth&#xD;
the grim decree :&#xD;
L " For that Igg hath done , this treason, Laird and&#xD;
Clan shall cease to be !&#xD;
To boats! Dunvegan."&#xD;
On they dashed across the water with a flag from&#xD;
every spar,&#xD;
Like the swaying, tufted treetops where the maple&#xD;
forests are,&#xD;
And their women waved them kisses from the&#xD;
shore, till they were far       -$&#xD;
Out sight Dunvegan.&#xD;
Undefended lay the Island-clad in newly (Allen snow,&#xD;
Like a martyr maiden, ma itled all in -white, who&#xD;
w-lts the blow,&#xD;
For the doomed had seen at night the fiery cross go&#xD;
to and fro&#xD;
To rouse Dunvegan.&#xD;
They had spied the flaggy squadron, doubled, trip-&#xD;
pled by their fears,&#xD;
And the clansmen and the children and the men of&#xD;
hoary years,&#xD;
&#xD;
87&#xD;
Left their homes, aud on their threshholds, wet&#xD;
with woman's angry tears,&#xD;
Cursed hard&amp;amp;Duivegan.&#xD;
Up the rocks the mad avengers leaped and found&#xD;
tnere none to slay ;&#xD;
But the false snow tracked the exiles, and the&#xD;
that hes on the way         7&#xD;
Fed the fire that smothered hundreds in the cavern&#xD;
where they lay,&#xD;
Shame on Dunvegan!&#xD;
O'er this holocaust of terror, and the howlings of&#xD;
despair,&#xD;
As from out the pit of horro rs, came again the&#xD;
m:mideu's prayer:                  *&#xD;
"Save me ! Save me or I perish!" Now a steed&#xD;
comes-" Who goes there ?"&#xD;
"Prince of Dunvegan."&#xD;
Through the flames and fiercer ffcea, and the chok-&#xD;
ing blindinglamoke,&#xD;
With his tartan wrapped around him, thro' that&#xD;
funeral pyre he broke,&#xD;
Horse and rider plunging downward-it was Fanta-&#xD;
sole who spoke:&#xD;
God save Dunvegan!&#xD;
Wondering s lence soon was broken by the moan--&#xD;
ing, dying cry,&#xD;
Of the cnarger doubly laden, up the cavern dashing&#xD;
And tho' Laird and Clan did perish, Fantasole&#xD;

GOIRMUIL.&#xD;
Backward was the water flung,&#xD;
And the smoking oar-locks rung,&#xD;
As the herald's flag of green,&#xD;
Sped from ancient Waterstein.&#xD;
'Twas the boat of Aleck Ban-&#xD;
Highland Scotia's fairest man-&#xD;
Whom the doubting Ich Macleod&#xD;
Sent to woo the maiden proua *&#xD;
Honor, bright as blade of steel,&#xD;
At the breath of Gormti-il*&#xD;
Suddenly how dim it grew,&#xD;
Looking in her eyes of blue !&#xD;
Walking seaward, side by side,&#xD;
On the beach alona, Kilbrido,&#xD;
Spirits twain had eaped to be&#xD;
One through all eternity.&#xD;
She was Laird Clan Ronald's heiu;&#xD;
Love its every foe will dare,&#xD;
And her sire, mayhap, did steal&#xD;
Willing bride like Gormu-il.&#xD;
Maidens know not what to choose,&#xD;
Gentle force is best to use ;&#xD;
Yonder was the castle moat,.&#xD;
Nirher lay the eight-oared boat.&#xD;
Ere she knew it, Aleck Ban&#xD;
With his ulushing burden ran,&#xD;
And the grating of the keel&#xD;
Drowned the sigh of Gornu-il&#xD;
*        *  *    *           *&#xD;
Soon he soothed her fluttering fears,&#xD;
When he told her mid her tears,&#xD;
How before her beauty bowed&#xD;
His fair cousin Ich Macleod.&#xD;
* In the Gaelic : Blue eyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
88&#xD;
&#xD;
Then she whispered : ."4Tell me now&#xD;
Is he fairer yet than thou ?"&#xD;
While her azure eyes were fraught&#xD;
With a look that spoke her heart,&#xD;
Ocean heard the vows he said;.&#xD;
And the moon shone overhead,&#xD;
Covering them u ith shimmering sheen&#xD;
As they sailed in Waterstein.&#xD;
Quick as spreading of the flame&#xD;
Grew the rumors of his shame,&#xD;
Till himself to Ian More,&#xD;
Ich Macleod his curses bore.&#xD;
He their uncle-he their chief,&#xD;
Roused by oldOlan Ronald's grief,&#xD;
Sentence gai e that Aleck Ban&#xD;
Must give up his bride orilan.&#xD;
*     *     *     *    *     *&#xD;
Gormu-il her lord forewarned&#xD;
" Maior More the headsman scorned&#xD;
"Comes to break with other three&#xD;
On our cottage'by the sea."&#xD;
"Let them comet" said Aleck Ban,&#xD;
a I will meet them-man to man ;&#xD;
"Feign me sick, but in the bed&#xD;
"Hi eme ropes beneath my head!"&#xD;
Up the headsman to the room&#xD;
Came unconsciousof his doom,&#xD;
Breathing threatening for the past,&#xD;
But his first words were his-last;&#xD;
Onhim Aleck with his bands&#xD;
Sprang and tied him feet to hands,&#xD;
And the others-over-thrown&#xD;
Fast together-left alone.&#xD;
Champing till his boat was manned,&#xD;
-     And they pushed her of the sand,&#xD;
Straight he dashed across the bay.&#xD;
Where Dunvegan Castle lay.&#xD;

Thro' the staring menial horde,&#xD;
Past the lady of his lord,&#xD;
Fiercely rushing Aleck Ban&#xD;
Sought the chieftain of the clan.&#xD;
Pressing on the -towerward path,&#xD;
Hotter grew-his reckless wrath,&#xD;
Open flew the panelled wall,&#xD;
In he strode before them all&#xD;
" Would my Liege that I had died&#xD;
"Ere thou sent toubring my bide!&#xD;
"I am Aleck, named the fair,&#xD;
"Let him fetch her who shall dire1"&#xD;

"But the insult of to-day&#xD;

"By the' saints that livedof yore!&#xD;

Then the chieftain, -ndismayed,&#xD;
Reached and took a hanging blade&#xD;

Dearer to him than his power.&#xD;
From the scabbard Torquil,&#xD;
Leapt to crush the lighter steel.&#xD;

by escapades, only pardoned to beauty&#xD;
and eccentricities credited to genius.&#xD;
An orphan from childhood, she had&#xD;
come to be looked upon in the manner&#xD;
of a file du regiment-a daughter of&#xD;
the Institute-whom people no more&#xD;
thought of holding to the stern code&#xD;
of. decorum, than old Patsy, the ebon&#xD;
cook, to the strictest rules of graceful-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
One must see Patsy, in the minds&#xD;
eye, to feel the force of the figure.-&#xD;
Of a darkness that shone, and almost&#xD;
as broad as long,- her weight was so&#xD;
elephantine, that to crack the ice for&#xD;
dinner, the girls said she only need&#xD;
step on the cleaver. Owing to her&#xD;
build it was easy enough to laugh be-&#xD;
hind her back, but few dared face her&#xD;
angry, and she was about the only&#xD;
part of the'institution Oily Romar had&#xD;
ever stood in awe of. Once the spirit&#xD;
&#xD;
of mischief -possessed some- of the&#xD;
boldest to enjoy a contraband -eupper&#xD;
of watermelons. Such tables are not&#xD;
wont to be burdened with luxuries,&#xD;
and -there was a pining for the juicy&#xD;
fruit they had espied in a neighboring&#xD;
garden. After the house was still one&#xD;
moonlight night, it was but a moment's&#xD;
work for Oly- and -a confederate to&#xD;
sally forth and return well laden to&#xD;
meet their fellow-plotters in the dining&#xD;
room. The talk was in a whisper,&#xD;
and- the plates were- muffled with nap-&#xD;
kins. Their laughter had got to be,&#xD;
not loud, but deep, - and stolen fruit&#xD;
never tasted sweeter, when, suddenlyy&#xD;
emerging -from her dark domain, Patsy&#xD;
glowered upon them, clothed on with&#xD;
robes and cap of gh stly whiteness.&#xD;
Before that wierd preseuce what won-&#xD;

Speaking never a *ord, with arms&#xD;
akimbo, there she stood, the imperson,&#xD;
ation of insulted kitchendom, -till tho&#xD;
knives dropped froin nerveless fingers,&#xD;
and. one by' one the culprits stole noise&#xD;
lessly away. Of all, only Olly stayed,&#xD;
to finish her repast, and then carving&#xD;
a huge piece,. of luscious redness, beg-&#xD;
ged the uninvited guest to drown her&#xD;
ire in its liquid coolness. A idaoity so&#xD;
sublime, met'no repulse, an the temp-&#xD;
tation no resistance.   Th's double&#xD;
stroke there was no witlstan ing, and&#xD;
ever after a- strange compact seemed&#xD;
to unite these antipodes, by which the&#xD;
sins of" the one were shielded, and the&#xD;
face of .the other lightened with a love&#xD;
for the motherless child, and a lively&#xD;
-interest in all her fortunes.&#xD;
At times a crishing sense of her&#xD;
loneliness would come to the orphan,&#xD;
fir her lite wa.,Aot all'sunshine,' and&#xD;
&#xD;
in the cloudy days she could not for-&#xD;
get how unprotectedd she really was,&#xD;
without a relative in the wide world,&#xD;
and with, only the friends she 'had&#xD;
made among her ever changing.school-&#xD;
nates. As for the other ex, she: hard-&#xD;
ly saw a face ,she could- admire, save&#xD;

she' had when the nun-like procession,&#xD;
headed and flanked by teachers, moved&#xD;
in .the dead march across the payemnent,&#xD;

the narrow sidewalk.    But though&#xD;

graces of a struck position. But with&#xD;
a laugh and a glance all these were&#xD;
thrown aside for one -she could not&#xD;
scan too often nor prize too tenderly.&#xD;
She had. had it since seventeen, with&#xD;
every now- and then a letter from the&#xD;
original, who was her Guardian.'&#xD;
- There' was not so much difference&#xD;
between their agee as- this relation&#xD;
would seem to indicate. Erle Pentz&#xD;
was scarcely thirty, and a lithe form&#xD;
and features-of sanguine temperament&#xD;
gave him the look ofone stillyounger.&#xD;
Added - to his native oomeliness and&#xD;
and ease of manner, was the polish&#xD;
caught from 'the highest social life in&#xD;
his southern home, and long residence&#xD;
on 'the continent. His very smile was&#xD;
captivating, and his gentle -deference&#xD;
to woman:- repossessed the- merest&#xD;
stranger inhis favor.&#xD;
&#xD;
97&#xD;
One morning as the corps of school&#xD;
girls dragged its length along, on its&#xD;
return, Olly shocked the pro prieties&#xD;
by rushing out of the racks and shak-&#xD;
ing hands with a passer by, who hard-&#xD;
ly recognized her, though his after&#xD;
glance of admiration made full amends&#xD;
for his first want of recollection. The&#xD;
teacher in charge looked on in dumb&#xD;
amaze, till Erle Pentz by a polite re-&#xD;
quest, which had all the force of a&#xD;
command, brushed away, every trace&#xD;
of embarrassment:    "Madam! your&#xD;
most obedient. My ward seems in-&#xD;
stinctively to seek the protection of her&#xD;
guardian. If you please we will fob&#xD;
low  after."     Ah   certainly, Mr.&#xD;
Pentz," she replied your rights are&#xD;
paramount."&#xD;
So your memory was better than&#xD;

fell'to the rear.&#xD;

"Oh !'.' you have not changed as&#xD;
much as I," replied Olly, while the&#xD;
thought of her daily study of his fea-&#xD;
tures deepened the rose-tints.&#xD;
" No, you have become a butterfly&#xD;
since I saw you." -&#xD;
" What an ugly chrysalis I must&#xD;
have been, really," she laughed.&#xD;
"Ydu translate the type too literal-&#xD;
ly," said he. "Do not carry.it either&#xD;
forward or backward. A thing of&#xD;
beauty should be a joy forever:"&#xD;
+ Just then her attention was all ab-&#xD;
sorbed, watching the yacht coming up&#xD;
before the wind, to which she pointed&#xD;
admiringly. "Oh! yes,"said he "that is&#xD;
the way we came, Fay and I, to cruise&#xD;
around here for a few days; and he&#xD;
is letting the morning breezes. blow&#xD;
the cob webs from his brain, his misty&#xD;

"Do br'. him the next time you&#xD;

" I have not.time to-day, but give&#xD;

tell them I am coming to take you for&#xD;

with a little flutter in the heart, for&#xD;

"Now Patsy! don't be cross;" she&#xD;
pleaded, " if we hadn't missed the&#xD;
road we should have been home long&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
"Lost the :road, eh ! if you don't&#xD;
take care you'll lose your heart next,&#xD;
1/.y rose, mind I tell you."&#xD;
"You wont tell will you? he wants&#xD;
to be my guardian always," whispered&#xD;
the maiden with an arch look over her&#xD;
shoulder, and tripping lightly to her&#xD;
room.      .&#xD;
"IUh ! what does she want for to&#xD;
go marry that southerner? and her&#xD;
guardian too" the old woman mumbled,&#xD;
as she softly locked the doors, "there's&#xD;
&#xD;
101&#xD;
a law against it, or there ought t" be."&#xD;
The next day broke. balmy and&#xD;
beautiful, as was meet for the longest&#xD;
of the year, and Oily was up with the&#xD;
sun, looking over her treasures, and&#xD;
selecting a gala costume, so carefully&#xD;
her room-mate rallied hez. But this&#xD;
was the last afternoon the yacht would&#xD;
lie in those waters, and Erle had told&#xD;
her to wear her jewels, and they would&#xD;
spend on board their -last hour togeth-&#xD;
or, if she decreed it so. She aske n&#xD;
reason ; indeed, perhaps she half 1 n-&#xD;
derstood what he meant, and his wish -&#xD;
os were laws to her already.&#xD;
They remembered afterward how&#xD;
restless she was all that day, laughing&#xD;
and crying by turn,, and when the&#xD;
shadows began to lengthen, wistfully&#xD;
watching for the yacht's flag. At last&#xD;
with its airy pennant, around a cliff&#xD;
the bounding bark came , ashing into&#xD;

bight, and down the hill-roia  sh&#xD;
sped like a waiting arrow, meot'.&#xD;
ing the young men just as they sprang&#xD;
ashore to fasten the bowline. An old&#xD;
boatman on the wharf shook his head&#xD;
looking at the sky, and tried to dis-&#xD;
suade them from putting out, but they,&#xD;
only laughed at his fears, and Olly had&#xD;
none, or lost them in her happiness,&#xD;
before the village spires vanished in&#xD;
the distance. Watching the west that&#xD;
gleamed like a sea of molten gold,&#xD;
she sat by Erle who held the tiller,&#xD;
-ani the hand h was praying 1b; her&#xD;
heart he knew he had already.&#xD;
So, lazily, the yacht beat about where&#xD;
their faney turned or the light breeze&#xD;
wafted it, till the twilight deepened&#xD;
and the evening star hung over the&#xD;
horizon. Mr. Pay lay forward, with&#xD;
his dap over-his eyes, smoking, as if&#xD;
the4 cene was'en1igone for reverie&#xD;

&#xD;

In that soft ani mullow light there&#xD;
was. no need for words, and even&#xD;
Erle ceased his earnest pleadings.&#xD;
All nature seemed soothed to silence,&#xD;
and no one roared to break the spell by&#xD;
speaking of return. But while they&#xD;
were dreaming ominous clouds had&#xD;
covered the eastern  sky, and now&#xD;
white caps of foam crested the waves.&#xD;
The sail flapped before the moaning of&#xD;
the coming tempest. A shroud of&#xD;
gloom fast closed around, almost hid-&#xD;
ing them from each other. Quick as&#xD;
thought they made ready for the shock,&#xD;
and hardly before the squall ,struck&#xD;
and passed over them. For a moment&#xD;
their little craft trembled in the grasp&#xD;
of the gale, but staunchly rode it out,&#xD;
with no loss save the signal lamp,&#xD;
which the wind shivered.&#xD;
One peril had passed,but a more fear-&#xD;
ful remained. The blackness of dark-&#xD;

ness still surrounded thei,all the wind&#xD;
died away, and there, without a light,&#xD;
they floated in the very, path of every&#xD;
passing steamer. It seemed the cloud&#xD;
never would lift, when suddenly the&#xD;
shrill whistle sounded close upon them,&#xD;
and soon they could hear the splash-&#xD;
ing of the great wheels, and the cleav-&#xD;
ing of the water. Rumbling through&#xD;
the gloom ahead tie noise of ponder-&#xD;
ous strokes they could, count drowned&#xD;
tue young men's shouting. The sense&#xD;
of their weakness crushed, and the&#xD;
awe of that unseen but certain danger&#xD;
almost maddened them. Louder grew&#xD;
the beats that steadily measured their&#xD;
minutes. Then out of the darkness&#xD;
glared the headlight like the burning&#xD;
eye of a Cyclops. The ^monster was&#xD;
bearing right down upon them.  Its&#xD;

During those perilous moments Olly&#xD;
Romar, with her hand in Erle's, still&#xD;
as a statue and as pale too, must have&#xD;
lived a lifetime  Nearer and nearer it&#xD;
came, till with one last long skriek of&#xD;
despair, they stgod in helpless horror&#xD;
watching the fate that swept across&#xD;
the water. Then the pilot must have&#xD;
heard, for sheering off a little, with a&#xD;
flash and a roar, the thumping, hissing&#xD;
flaming thing crashed by, so close they&#xD;
could almost touch its sides, and left&#xD;
them breathless.&#xD;
That terrible tension gone from her&#xD;
nerves she flung herself into his arms&#xD;
sobbing : "When will you take me&#xD;
home, to your home, Erle ?"&#xD;
The memory of the light that just&#xD;
gleamed on hin through the gates of&#xD;
death made him pause--it should have&#xD;

Events within the. memory of most&#xD;

dreadful vision, and her arched neck&#xD;
marked with the ,prints of ruthless&#xD;
fingers. The footsteps on the ploughed&#xD;
ground were single, and by the fence&#xD;
was the track of 'a wagon's turning.&#xD;
Among the aroused community none&#xD;
had seen her ever before, nor could&#xD;
they find a trace -of who had left in&#xD;
their-peaceful homes this pallid record&#xD;
of a crime.&#xD;
Carried to the Town Hall it lay for&#xD;
days, during the inquest, vainly await-&#xD;
ing recognition.  Descriptive notices&#xD;
were scattered far and near, calling on&#xD;
friends to come and claim their dead&#xD;
and they. came from every quarter,&#xD;
looking for the missing of the last Do-&#xD;
eade. The intense excitement, in a&#xD;
country village, where .gossip over a&#xD;
neighbor's wife or horse will draw a&#xD;
group of eager listeners may be ima-&#xD;
gined. Day after day "  it grew by&#xD;
&#xD;
109&#xD;
what it fed upon," as the poor clay&#xD;
was claimed for a lost darling, by one&#xD;
and another, only at last to be disowns&#xD;
ed again.&#xD;
Of the thousands that gazed upon&#xD;
it, the wonder was, not that some&#xD;
dreamed a likeness till they found&#xD;
some fatal discrepancy between fact&#xD;
and fancy, but that none recognized&#xD;
the waif which bore so many marks&#xD;
of recent care and culture. How could&#xD;
a face, so fair with lines of intellect,&#xD;
thus drop ojt of life and leave no&#xD;
chasm ? Every hour brought its the-&#xD;
ory, but no solution of the mystery.--j&#xD;
'Twas said a strange negress :had&#xD;
shuddered at sight of the features, and&#xD;
sobbed out a name, as she kissed the&#xD;
forehead; but this rumor, like the rest&#xD;
proved traceless.&#xD;
Then ,just before the burial, the&#xD;
case took on a phase yt t more singuv&#xD;

<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7063-00000056"/>&#xD;
110&#xD;
1ar. A young woman, from some miles&#xD;
away,positively identified the unknown&#xD;
as her-own sister, who, seen of many,&#xD;
had been living for months in the very&#xD;
village .so full of wonderment. 'Marks&#xD;
and molas fell in with the testimony,&#xD;
and placed the fact beyond dispute'&#xD;
None dissented but a portrait painter&#xD;
A friend was known to have lately&#xD;
driven her out in the direction of her&#xD;
another's home, aut her few days' ab&#xD;
pence had been thus accounted for ;&#xD;
but the family knew not where she&#xD;
was, until this chance look recognized&#xD;
her in the stranger. On his arrest the&#xD;
escort protested he had left her safe on&#xD;
the road a little way from her mother's&#xD;
house ;- but this only increased suspi.&#xD;
cion, and amidst a storm of popular&#xD;
indignation he was thrust into the&#xD;
murderer's cell,, as much to save him&#xD;
harmless as the najesty of the law'&#xD;
&#xD;
X11&#xD;
Not many years after from that sanie&#xD;
cell a mob dragged out a negro pris-&#xD;
oner, held on suspician of a lessor&#xD;
crime, and left him dangling from a&#xD;
court-yard tree, in. the Sunday twi-&#xD;
light.&#xD;
But soon there came a great. calm.&#xD;
While the minister was. preaching her&#xD;
funeral sermon, a physician, on his&#xD;
circuit, met the missing, girl a bloom,&#xD;
with vitality, visiting some other friend&#xD;
meanwhile, and all unconscious of: her&#xD;
sudden taken off.&#xD;
" My God! Miss, they were going&#xD;
to bury you this afternoon, and may-&#xD;
hap the man that killed you to-mor-&#xD;
row .!" he exclaimed, and lifting her in&#xD;
his gig rode a race to the Town Hall,&#xD;
where' shea confronted the dead and&#xD;
confounded the living. Her actual&#xD;
presence, in flesh and blood unmeet to&#xD;
fill the others ghastly cerements, was&#xD;

indisputable ; and though the rent it&#xD;
made in that tissue of error, glibly&#xD;
called  circumstantial evidence, her&#xD;
friend passed out to freedom.'&#xD;
Again the shadows settled down&#xD;
thicker than ever, and rested,dark and&#xD;
impenetrable over the namesless grave.&#xD;
Letters and pictures, sent every now&#xD;
and then for years to the officials,&#xD;
brought no clue either to the actors or&#xD;
the victim of the tragedy ; and it came&#xD;
to be mentioned only in the MYSTERY&#xD;
OF DANSKAMMEl.&#xD;
III.&#xD;
Yet one there was who chanced, in&#xD;
the Court-room, to see. the dead girl's&#xD;
gentle face, and thought she knew it;&#xD;
but when so many had mistaken, it is&#xD;
not strange from timidity and ignor-&#xD;
ance of duty, she shrank from volun- 4&#xD;
tearing h'r unsupported opinion. Be-&#xD;
&#xD;
1.13&#xD;
side in her simplicity, she thought&#xD;
more of charging the crime upon its&#xD;
author, than of linking him with it,&#xD;
by establishing the identity of his vie-&#xD;
tim. The name,whispered with a kiss,&#xD;
was "Oily Romar !" and when ifter-&#xD;

tered for a military hospital, her belief&#xD;
was turned into assurance.&#xD;

in thei noise of battle drown the loud-&#xD;
er voices of some great remorse,&#xD;
The other was wasted, t1 his arm&#xD;
looked as if it never could have borne&#xD;
a musket; and his hollow  eyes were&#xD;
ever watching his companion while he,&#xD;
raved, with a frightened stare. They&#xD;
seemed to have been partners in some&#xD;
awful secret, whose terrible bond yet&#xD;
kept them together here, and would&#xD;
hold them hereafter..&#xD;
Suddenly in hip delirium  the dra-&#xD;
goon would spring up and point down&#xD;
the corridor, shrieking : ' There, Fay !&#xD;
see!. she is coming with the marks on&#xD;
her throat just where 'the bullet tore&#xD;

Removed out of sight and: hearing,&#xD;
whispers of his strange ravings reoched&#xD;
Patsy, and to satisfy her. eyes and ears&#xD;
he carried some broth- to his' bedside.&#xD;
His mind was clear again.&#xD;
Recognising her he told what the&#xD;
reader already knows, and .of Olly's&#xD;
short-lived happiness-abroad, and how&#xD;
on their return the truth burst upon&#xD;
her in his real wife's appearance and&#xD;
taunts of infamy.   "Then her love&#xD;
turned to hate," gasped the guilty,&#xD;
wretched dying Erle Penty, F and she&#xD;
threatened me with every penalty of&#xD;
outraged justice, but I was mad to&#xD;
---Ha! there she comes again. The&#xD;
prints on her neck are red as coals of&#xD;

asked a buxom daughter of the Pala-&#xD;

dwelt on the other side of the Wal-&#xD;
kill, where the English element pre-&#xD;
dominated.&#xD;
"tAfter going on so many years it&#xD;
will hardly stop of itself, Miss Nanchie&#xD;
but Lord Cornwallis, I fancy,. will soon&#xD;
end it to the satisfaction of 'those who&#xD;
sent him," replied George Blackburn,&#xD;

118&#xD;
whose Tory fooling was so strong as to&#xD;
make the course of his love run any-&#xD;
thing but smooth, at times, when his&#xD;
affianced thought such harranges worth&#xD;
rebuke.&#xD;
"Better a thirty years war as my&#xD;
forefathers had at home than such&#xD;
an ending !" gravely spoke Ianchie&#xD;
Houslander.&#xD;
"They fought for a free Conscience&#xD;
'and a free Bible, and I honor them,&#xD;
but this is a rebellion against the&#xD;
"Protector of Faith."  Women cannot&#xD;
expect. to understand these things how'&#xD;
ever."&#xD;
"I understand --enough, George&#xD;
Blackburn,-to know .that they settled&#xD;
for all time the principle of Individ-&#xD;
gal Sovereignty, and so perhaps we&#xD;
had better part in peace," darkly hint-=&#xD;
ed the indignant damsel.&#xD;
It was in the Spring, and the river&#xD;
&#xD;
119&#xD;
was high and rising to a freshet, as&#xD;
they  rode thus discoursing. When&#xD;
they had nearly reached Ward's Bridge&#xD;
(whose ruins remain) he spoke to turn&#xD;
her: thoughts, and wished they were&#xD;
over.&#xD;
"No! I wish I could always stay&#xD;
on:this side," Nanchie persisted, there&#xD;
are too many Tories over there and&#xD;
Tories are Traitors.&#xD;
Just then circumstances over which&#xD;
they had no control put an end to a&#xD;
dispute which might have proved dis-&#xD;
astrous. Going on the bridge the wa-&#xD;
ter had reached the hubs of the wheels,&#xD;
but going off it rose yet higher, and&#xD;
before they thought of danger, the&#xD;
swift current took their horse off his&#xD;
feet, and swept them down the stream.&#xD;

angrily.&#xD;
" It means that while the road to&#xD;

A glance over the field convinced&#xD;
the Dominie that discretion was the&#xD;

his rage, hie mounted his horse and&#xD;
rode away, shooting.out his flaming&#xD;

The time of the end had almost come&#xD;

by the foot of the Pale Face. Attimes&#xD;

again the thought of their ancestral&#xD;

the taunts of the women enrage the&#xD;

unsparingly, and not without avail.&#xD;
Pensioned spies among them    both&#xD;
guided and revealed-their deliberations.&#xD;
Of these none wielded more power&#xD;
than Joliper, whose father, though of&#xD;
French extraction, had kept 'his place&#xD;
in the tribe, and transmitted it to his&#xD;
son, who, with the blood of two races,&#xD;
had the vices of both and the virtues&#xD;
of neither.&#xD;
ut there was one-the young Chief&#xD;
of t Mahopacs-whom even he did=&#xD;
not dare approach. Omoyao was every&#xD;
inch a warrior, singularly courteous in&#xD;
speech, sagacious in counsel,a&amp;amp;nd no-&#xD;
ble, in demeanor.&#xD;
Too wary to be led, too brave to be&#xD;
cowed, Joliper knew England was not&#xD;

Omoyao might have prolonged what it&#xD;

Between these two there could be nu&#xD;
compromise. Such variance must ever&#xD;
clash till the struggle ends in ruin to&#xD;
the vanquished.   Suspected- for his&#xD;
lineage, ah-eady Joliper's reputation&#xD;
for loyalty had been blown upon, and&#xD;
he knew he could not stand a moment&#xD;
in open opposition to his popular ad-&#xD;
versary. True to his instincts he set&#xD;
himself to undermine what he could&#xD;
not attack ; and another motive, yet&#xD;

Oroton, dwelt the Fleet Deer, and it&#xD;
is not wonderfat she detested the one&#xD;
as uch as she admired the other of&#xD;

buti feel loathing illbconcealed for the&#xD;
crawling spy; yet conscious of his cap'&#xD;
ability for she knew not what deed of&#xD;
treachery, away for. the sake of her&#xD;

him with a calm exterior.&#xD;
Omayao's worship was not weak=&#xD;

It was this sentiment, as well as the&#xD;

Through all the summer negotiations&#xD;

One evening, a few weeks before&#xD;

amusing .his dotage with her lively&#xD;

and time have changed all that--then&#xD;

now is only a ravine of swift flowing&#xD;

rious questions about the success of&#xD;
the hunting party he had left with a&#xD;
semblance of that deep respect so flat-&#xD;
tering to the aged. Maya had risen&#xD;
to go within and leave them to their&#xD;
pipes, when he prevented her with his&#xD;
quavering voice:&#xD;
"Will not the Fleet Deer stay to&#xD;
welcome the guest, who has ridden so&#xD;
far to see her whom he has loved so&#xD;
long ?"&#xD;
"IIf my father wishes," she said,&#xD;
"but the Red Fox knows his offers of&#xD;

"Maya is glad; the Fleet Deer is&#xD;

"Sacre !" hissed Jolipir, throwing&#xD;
off his thin disguise of language as he&#xD;
was 'wont: to do when angered," why&#xD;
needst thou tell me this before thou&#xD;
knowest even why I have returned ?"&#xD;
"Maya can bear bitter tidings; let&#xD;
the Red Fox speak !"&#xD;
"No, they will fly fast enough,"&#xD;
said Joliper, " but now let Maya listen&#xD;
how she can be most happy," and whis-&#xD;
pering; that the old man's doze might&#xD;
continue, he pointed skyward, "when&#xD;
yonder moon is new again the Tribes&#xD;
will resolve to go far to the West.&#xD;
But I love the life the Pale Face leads&#xD;
too well, and so dost thou in thy&#xD;
heart! The wilderness will have no&#xD;

heard then how her Black ,Moose in&#xD;
his roaming has been caught in the&#xD;
toils of-the daughter of the Pale Face,"&#xD;
bitterly laughed Joliper, filling out the&#xD;
narrative with incidents so plausible&#xD;
Maya's faith was for a moment shaken&#xD;
for he hinted more than he told. But&#xD;
she checked the doubt as unholy. The&#xD;
lovers had made an early .compact if&#xD;
ever the clouds of distrust came be-d&#xD;
tween them to see each other face to&#xD;
face, before taking a step toward part-&#xD;
ing, and let their frank glances chase&#xD;
away the shadows.     Thoughtlessly&#xD;
made, it was sacredly remembered;&#xD;
and with defiant look she flung back&#xD;
the falsehood.&#xD;
Then Joliper, in his rage, fast and&#xD;
furiously poured forth the proofs of his&#xD;
hate and his villainy : Recreant or&#xD;
true, thou shalt never wed him. The&#xD;
Chiefs shall never trust him, and I&#xD;
&#xD;
149&#xD;
shall never fear him more ! When he&#xD;
returns it will be in disgrace, for 1&#xD;
have shown them the secret springs of&#xD;
his pretended patriotism. They know&#xD;
thy tastes for the fashions of' heir foes.&#xD;
They suppose thou must stay for thy&#xD;
father's sake, and I have told them it&#xD;
is thy voice, not his, they hear even&#xD;
counselling to cling to the ancient&#xD;
hunting grounds.   What if all be&#xD;
lalse, they believe it is more thy smile&#xD;
than their good he cares for, and I&#xD;
shall see to it his smooth tongue wags&#xD;
not much longer to thwart my wishes.&#xD;
Scorn on, proud girl ! the time draws&#xD;
near when thou shalt beg love of him&#xD;
thou scornest," and stifling a curse, he&#xD;
leaped on his horse and disappeared in&#xD;
the forest.&#xD;
All this time with an arrow ready to&#xD;
avenge a to  h of insult, among the&#xD;
stunted tr es stood Omoyao. He had&#xD;

left the hunt when he noticed that&#xD;
strange and abrupt departure, which&#xD;
boded no good to the angel of his wor&#xD;
ship. Crossing the river above, and&#xD;
climbing the bluff he saw all, and&#xD;
heard enough to forwain him of covert&#xD;
dangers, and without making his pres-&#xD;
once known stole away as noiselessly as&#xD;
he had come till the few miles were&#xD;
passed that brought him to his Island&#xD;
home,&#xD;
With body wearied and mind over-&#xD;
wrought he sank upon his bear-skin&#xD;
couch but not to sleep- He could no&#xD;
more stop the throbs of his brain than&#xD;
the beats of his heart- The ceaseless&#xD;
flow of thought went on pitilessly, till&#xD;
every nerve was in thrill and will had&#xD;
control no longer. Beside time was'&#xD;
too precious thus to squander  The&#xD;
night was to plan in, the morrow to&#xD;
act in, if he would escape the meshes&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

151&#xD;
of his enemies. He quailed not for the&#xD;
ambush or the assassin. His prowess&#xD;
could shield himself as of old, but ob-&#xD;
jects were in jeopardy he loved better.&#xD;
Should the poison work long enough,&#xD;
and his influence be broken, the na-&#xD;
tional ties would dissolve like frost&#xD;
work, and then life would not be worth&#xD;
the living ; or worsted,with the ban of&#xD;
the Tribes upon hip, how could he&#xD;
save Maya from an embrace worse&#xD;
than the grave.&#xD;
When daylight streaked the sky he&#xD;
was still thinking, but the flutter of&#xD;
the faculties was gone,and a new sensor&#xD;
seemed added so supernaturally clear&#xD;
came suggestions he could not trace,&#xD;
but thanked the Great Spirit for send-&#xD;

morn met with impenetrable reserve.&#xD;

it work itself out to the bitter end, un-&#xD;

He saw the danger each mast meet or shun,&#xD;
And quickly planned what must be quickly done'&#xD;
A fortnight would elapse before the&#xD;
council, that could only be fraught with&#xD;
opportunities to Joliper and disaster to&#xD;
him. That fortnight must be blotted&#xD;
out ! Calling the fleetest runners ,of&#xD;
the tribe, he spoke : "Heaston to the&#xD;
Chiefs and the warriors at the chase,&#xD;
and say the Warden of Mahopac -sum-&#xD;
mons them    to the Ancient Council&#xD;
Chamber on the night of the full moon&#xD;

was one of the few prerogatives that&#xD;
still clung to an office somewhat like&#xD;
and sacred as that of Roman Augur.&#xD;
The Chiefs of the Mahopacs had held&#xD;
it for centuries. The mysterious lake&#xD;
was under their-peculiar guardianship,&#xD;
and through the ages they alone could&#xD;
build the yearly council. fire that was&#xD;
wont to light the Island. Many who&#xD;
have rowed around it will recognize the&#xD;
name of Petrea, which some sailor has&#xD;
painted on the rocks close by where&#xD;
now the skiffs land their daily freight&#xD;
of pienicers ; and to some it will bring&#xD;
back happy memories of rustic joys,&#xD;
and gleams of the days of young ro-&#xD;
mance. Such will remember the dell,&#xD;
so level, so spacious, with one side&#xD;
open to the Lake, and the rest closed&#xD;
in by craggy ledges higher than the&#xD;
pines. Here was the old Mohegan&#xD;

The runners returned at the time&#xD;
appointed with their mission accom-&#xD;
plished. They met not on their way&#xD;
with Joliper, who was at the English&#xD;
settlement awaiting Omoyao's return,&#xD;
plotting on, all unsuspicious of the&#xD;
presence of the master-hand that way&#xD;
brushing away like cobwebs the wiles&#xD;
he had wovet. At noon the next day&#xD;
the Warden kindled the fire and left it&#xD;
smouldering. Then crossing to the&#xD;
mainland, he rode away to the Falls of&#xD;
the Crotonto consult with Maya before&#xD;
the Chiefs should. gather at the twi-n&#xD;
light.&#xD;
For secrecy he fastened his horse&#xD;
below, where two trees had met in&#xD;
falling and bridged. the stream, taking&#xD;
&#xD;
an unfrequented .path through the&#xD;
woods that led to her abode. In front&#xD;
the tent sat the old man asleep and&#xD;
within were sung the songs he loved to&#xD;
hear. At his entrance doubt and sad-&#xD;
ness, surprise and joy chased each&#xD;
other the maiden's face, as shadows fly&#xD;
across the mountain before the sun-&#xD;
light through the rifted clouds.&#xD;
Her first words were full of trust;&#xD;
" Maya has wanted thee so much ;&#xD;
when wilt thou take her to thyself ?"&#xD;
"Sooner   than  the   Fleet Deer&#xD;
dreams of " he answered with a trium-&#xD;
phant smile, "to-night !" Then she told&#xD;
him what was unheard in the witness-&#xD;
ed interview, and he surprised her&#xD;
with the knowledge of the Chiefs'&#xD;
gathering at evening, where their be-&#xD;
trothal should be celebrated, and Joli-&#xD;
per's calumnies refuted forever.&#xD;

den's summons. The plots were not&#xD;
matured, that would have prevented&#xD;
that hated presence at the council; yet&#xD;
he might wring his heart through&#xD;
Maya, whom with some of his ready&#xD;
English minions he could carry off and&#xD;
marry at his leisure. With this intent&#xD;
they, were even now hovering about&#xD;
her dwelling when the creeping spy&#xD;
heard within the voice of Omoyao.&#xD;
Here was a double opportunity thrust&#xD;
upon him, and worth an ambush.&#xD;
No sooner had the Chief lifted the&#xD;
tent-cloth than an arrow whizzed past&#xD;
and the old man rolled down dead at&#xD;
-his feet. Carrying him in gently he&#xD;
spoke to the awestruck girl: " He is&#xD;
beyond the reach of insult, but not&#xD;
thou! Speed through the forest and&#xD;
meet me at the Island." As she fled&#xD;
one way he rushed out the other upon&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
157&#xD;
the mongrel gang, and cutting his way&#xD;
through them with his hatchet, leaped&#xD;
down the bluff. Maya's canoe lay&#xD;
there, and he spun it out into the rap-&#xD;
ids ,where Joliper did not dare to fol-&#xD;
low, but with arrows down through&#xD;
the foam it sped like a feather, poised&#xD;
so true, and steered so steadily, and in&#xD;
a little while, unharmed, his good steed&#xD;
was bearing him swiftly homeward.&#xD;
Then he heard his pursuers shouting&#xD;
to each other. They had swam their&#xD;
horses across above, and swept round&#xD;
to cut him off, but the Pass was&#xD;
near, and if he could reach it first&#xD;
there was a chance of foiling their fell&#xD;
design. The trees flew past,and as he&#xD;
dashedthrough it he could almost feel&#xD;
their breath upon his cheek.&#xD;
On, on, Mahopac is in sight. Over&#xD;
the streams without ever touching the&#xD;
water Selim flies like the wind. He&#xD;

noble Selim! and thy work is done.-&#xD;
Too far! too steep ! the chief's horse&#xD;
is down, and his foes are upon him.&#xD;
Then he stood at bay. His hatchet&#xD;
he flung crashing into the skull of&#xD;
one ; a swoop of his arm laid another&#xD;
low; and all the while his greedy eyes&#xD;
roamed round for Joliper. But he&#xD;
cared not to face his prisoner even&#xD;
bound and helpless, for they could not&#xD;
bind the glance of scorn, and that he&#xD;
shrank before. So, through the dus-&#xD;
ky light, they bore him to the edge. of&#xD;
the wooded Cape that puts out into the.&#xD;
Lake, South of Petrea. There tied to&#xD;
a tree, Toliper taunted him, and set-&#xD;
ting the woods on fire behind and&#xD;
araund, left him to his fate; hasting&#xD;
himself to the assembled warriors, and&#xD;
answering their wondering eyes with&#xD;
a tale of their warden's desertion.&#xD;

Omoyao could see the gleaming of&#xD;

agony. Like a lion in toils he strained&#xD;
at his bonds, but there was no hope&#xD;
till the fast encircling flames should&#xD;
loose them, and free body and spirit&#xD;
together. Higher leapt the lurid light&#xD;
till 'the lake was lit with the glare of&#xD;
the burning forest. Th   oar of the&#xD;
crackling flames, the shrie1ing of the&#xD;
birds, the flashing of the waves and&#xD;
canopy of rolling smoke made up a&#xD;
scene grand and terrible. The war&#xD;
den looked on unmoved, and made&#xD;
ready to chant his death song, but the&#xD;
sound of a paddle and Maya's ringing&#xD;
tones changed it to one of triumph.-&#xD;
Merciful winds blew the flame back-&#xD;

"Stand Mohegans! By the memory of the ages&#xD;
that are gone !&#xD;
By each mound and path of battle, on the foaming&#xD;
Kichawan !&#xD;
By the Lake the Spirit gave us ! Breast to breast,&#xD;
and eye to eye,&#xD;
Let us swear the oath of glory-one to couquer,one&#xD;
to die.&#xD;
Sound your wad-cry once forever, from Grand Sa-&#xD;
chem's hoary steep,&#xD;
Where the Eagles have their Eyries, and our Coun-&#xD;
try's vi gii- keep;&#xD;
Twice ten thousand shouts shall answer, from the&#xD;
river to the sea&#xD;
Dare, nor falter ! Fear is failure-Uraven hearted ;&#xD;
will ye flee?&#xD;
Go ! the western tribes shall meet yon; ye will be&#xD;
GO ! and perish in your eakness ; perish from the&#xD;
minds of men,&#xD;
Like the Highland river yonder, in its mountains&#xD;
wild and free.&#xD;
In the Ocean lost forever So shall be your desti-&#xD;

Then he turned hi o the maiden-worthy she to&#xD;
be his Queen,&#xD;
With her.lustrous ye unquailing, and her calm,&#xD;
majestic mien ;&#xD;
She, the Angel of his Worship, she, the Hearer o f&#xD;
his Prayer,&#xD;
Maiden of the beaming forehead, and the flowing&#xD;
raven hair.&#xD;
Wrapping close his, mantle round him, pointing&#xD;
down the the dark abyss,&#xD;
" Maya," cried heI; "I huve wooed thee, yet I&#xD;
wooed thee not for this.  °&#xD;
Here hath been my fathers' chiefdom, by Mahopacs&#xD;
craggy side,&#xD;
Here shall be my grave, 0 Maya t will thou be my&#xD;
Spirit bride ?"&#xD;
Looking on them long they listened, but she mur -&#xD;
imured naught, nor spoke,&#xD;
Only clung to Omoyao as the woodbine clasps the&#xD;
oak.&#xD;
And the chieftains, haft persuaded, paused a mo&#xD;
ment in their flight.&#xD;
Turned and saw the-dauntless lovers, leap together&#xD;
from the height,&#xD;
Beauty clinging unto grandeur, high resolve and&#xD;
love allied;&#xD;
Waves of life that met to perish, sothey might flow&#xD;
side by side.&#xD;
I have seen the brow of woman, with. a nobler ra-&#xD;
diance diaht&#xD;
Than theewelled crown bestoweth, or 'the dia-&#xD;
mond's magic light,&#xD;
I have dreamed peerless women-Queens of all&#xD;
the mythic time,&#xD;
In the realms of glory standing, isolated and sub-&#xD;
lime;&#xD;
Like lone columns rising over, lalen domes and&#xD;
ruined shrines,&#xD;
V1 i. the mellow twilight robes them, and the ivy&#xD;
round them twines.&#xD;
&#xD;

But to me that Indian maiden, faithful to the death&#xD;
and true&#xD;
Though her bridal robe were sackcloth, land her gar-&#xD;
land were the yew,&#xD;
Ever in the summer moonlight, or among the&#xD;
throngs of men,&#xD;
Comes so marked gin'life immortal, that me thinks&#xD;
I saw her then !&#xD;
And like waving woof of amber, all around the ma-&#xD;
ples old&#xD;
When the frost has touched the forest, and the&#xD;
leaves are green and gold,&#xD;
Maya's trust and woman's loving, lightens Petrea's&#xD;
rocky shore,&#xD;
Robes in romance, Lake and Island ; links them to&#xD;
her evermore.&#xD;
