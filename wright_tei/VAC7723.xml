CHAPTER'I.&#xD;
A REHIEARSAL.--A NOBLE PATRON OF THE DRAMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
PERHAPs there is no place in the world that is so utterly wretched&#xD;
and cheerless as a theatre during the day, presenting as it does so&#xD;
powerful, and, to the uninitiated, so strange a contrast, as it does&#xD;
at night.&#xD;
The interior of all theatres are much the same during rehearsal;&#xD;
it is always gloomy and desolate, and generally lit only by a faint and&#xD;
sickly light from the row of windows at the back of the gallery.&#xD;
The boxes, dress circle and the ornamental portions of the house,&#xD;
are covered with huge winding sheets of unbleached calico. A&#xD;
little elderly female is busily engaged in sweeping up the remnants&#xD;
of the previous night's play bills, pieces of orange--peel, and ginger-&#xD;
beer corks, out of the pit and as her broom-knockis against the&#xD;
seats, a dozen suflen echoes are awakened in the vast building,&#xD;
adding to the sad and deserted appearance of the place.&#xD;
The orchestra is lit by one little jet of gas, and its sole occupant&#xD;
the leader of the band, who is eliciting the most heart-rending&#xD;
sounds from his violin.&#xD;
In the left hand corner, or, what is more properly termed the&#xD;
"prompt " side of the stage, is a little table, covered with manu-&#xD;

4               Secrets of a Young Girl.&#xD;
script, pens, ink and paper, ef re which is seated a young man,&#xD;
with a care-worn and anxious face. This is the prompter.&#xD;
lJpon the stage, in groups, are a lumberr of persons of both&#xD;
sexes, some flashily others seedily dressed. These are the ladies&#xD;
and gentlemen of the establishment-the actors and actresses-the&#xD;
Hamlets and Ophelias-the Rob Roys and Helen Macgregors. The&#xD;
lessee and stage-manager, a Mr. Bowers. is a portly-looking man,&#xD;
with a countenance rather inflamed with strong potations, a remark-&#xD;
ably hoarse voiCe, and a style of conversation greatly enriched with&#xD;
curious oaths, a favorite maxim of this gentleman being that no man&#xD;
is qualified for the arduous part of a stage manager unless he can&#xD;
"swear hard ~no.mgh to split ~n oak tree Xown the centre, ~~-and to&#xD;
this maxim Mr. Bowers religio~i sly adheres.&#xD;
Strutting to and frow upon ~he stage, with a great show of import-&#xD;
ance, Mr. Bowers eyes his company much after the style of a gen-&#xD;
eral reviewing his troops-for this gentleman is never so happy&#xD;
as when he can de~e9t one of his employes committing some petty&#xD;
offence against the rules of this establishment, so that he might&#xD;
be able tc~ fine the delinquent half~a-crown or five shillings; on the&#xD;
following "treasury," for the breach thus committed.&#xD;
At length Mr. Bowers lQoks at his watch~ and then gives the&#xD;
~order to-&#xD;
"Clear the stage~"&#xD;
The groups of talkers disperse, and take up their respective&#xD;
position at the '.' wings," and 'busy themselves with their parts and&#xD;
~stage cueS.       takes     off&#xD;
The stag&amp;amp;.manager fr6m th~e proml~ter'~ table the mann-&#xD;
~scripts nautical drama of the "Idiot of the Ocean, or the Horrors of&#xD;
the Haunted Hulk," and the rehearsal commences.&#xD;
"Now, th~n," ~ried Mv. Bowers, "all ready? Act First, Scene&#xD;
.First-The Smugglers' Rendezvous. Cut Cave Scene-thin gloves&#xD;
horizon scene at back, Now then look alive there ! "'&#xD;
And "look alive" the stage-carpenter and his satellites did, for&#xD;
they possessed a moral horror of Mr. Bowers' temper.&#xD;
"Now then, Mr. Starter," cried Mr. Bowers, to a rather seedy&#xD;
;and very, mild-looking gentleman, who, though 'he played what is&#xD;
technically known as "heavies,"-.--that is villians of the deepest dye&#xD;
-looked as unlike a vihhian as a gentleman possibly could; "now&#xD;
Then, Mr. Starter, you open the first scene. You are discovered&#xD;
upon a keg of gunpowder, awaiting the arrival of the pirate hQrde."&#xD;
Without further worde, Mr. Starter began to recite in mono-&#xD;
tonous tones, and in a very hurried matter-of-fact manner, the&#xD;
following speech-for as a rule a good actor thinks it beneath his&#xD;
dignity to pay attention to anything beyond thejnere words of his&#xD;
pard at rehearsal-amid were he to attempt to gesticulate, or deliver&#xD;
his role in the morning with the same energy as when before the&#xD;
-~iieuce, l e would fall considerably in the estimation of his piofes-&#xD;
* . d brethern.&#xD;
~Ha! ha! I am Ricardo, the blood-stained B~mccaneer of the&#xD;
Baltic Sea-the dreaded avenger of nine wrongs. The black flag&#xD;
proudly waves o'er the ocean waste; Death follows in my wake,&#xD;
&#xD;
while my jovial crew revels upon confiscated cargoes. But hark!&#xD;
a voice-who comes here?"&#xD;
"Now, Mr. Villiers," roared Mr. Bowers, "where are you?.&#xD;
Your cue is--"hark, a voice-~who cones here ?"&#xD;
"Here, sir!" cried a yoi~ng man, advancing from the wings, where&#xD;
he had ~ en conversing with a pretty danseuse, who was attired in&#xD;
her ballet skirts.&#xD;
HERE, sir! " replied Mr. Bowers, passionately,-" here, sir! But&#xD;
you are not here, sir! you're chatting at the wings with Miss Marian&#xD;
Livingston, instead of attending to your business. You are both&#xD;
fined half-a-crown. Make a note of that Mr. Skip," added the irate&#xD;
manager, turning to the prom~npter.&#xD;
The young actor makes no remonstrance, but confronted the&#xD;
villian of the drama, and the rehearsal went on:--&#xD;
Mr. Stammer repeated the cue-&#xD;
'~ Hark a voice. Who comes here?"&#xD;
"'Tis I! Ferando the, Fisherman&#xD;
"You! Ha; ha! WhaLwouldyou?"&#xD;
"Revem:ige!&#xD;
"Ha! ha!&#xD;
"Yes, revenp~e! for J have sworn to destroy you, base Pirate l&#xD;
'Kiway, boy!"&#xD;
"Never! Come on"&#xD;
"Ne'verj Say you so! Then die!&#xD;
B5th th~ gentlePien carried walking-sticks-a habit'much affected&#xD;
by trarispontine actors.&#xD;
"Now, Vilhiers," said Mr. Starter, raising his stick while his&#xD;
brother professional did the same, "now for the combat."&#xD;
The leader of the band scraped a few notes upon his violin, and&#xD;
to the music the actors gently tapped their sticks together, and&#xD;
quietly went through what at night would be a terrible broad-&#xD;
sword combat.&#xD;
"One-two-three'; One-two-.three; Now the same under,&#xD;
round lights. One-two-three~double primes-cross; now&#xD;
the head stroke-good!&#xD;
A few moments were occupied in this, and at its conclusion) the&#xD;
two gentlemen shook hands, took a pinch of snuff, and avowed&#xD;
that 4ie combat would be air enormous "go" and would bring&#xD;
down the house."&#xD;
After this, the rehearsal proceeded with many interruptions, for&#xD;
Mr. Bowers was not in the best of tempers, and bullied every one&#xD;
indiscriminately.&#xD;
&#xD;
Among the employes' of the establishment who were assem-&#xD;
bled at the wings, was a rather good looking imian, who appeared&#xD;
about thirty five; his features were regular, but they were strongly&#xD;
marked, and denoted great sensuality. His countenance did not&#xD;
belie him, for lie was Viscount Rakeborough, who was noted&#xD;
throughom4t the Metropolis for his very extreme profligacy.&#xD;
"Hollo, Maud!" cried the Viscount, to a young girl, who had&#xD;
just entered the building, "hollo! How d'ye do?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"How do~ my noble swell "? responded the playful damseL&#xD;
What are you going to stami~d?"&#xD;
~'What ever you please my charmer,".was the gallant response.&#xD;
"Make it half a dozen of port," cried Maud;' then turning to&#xD;
hei' companions, she added, "Here girls, here's an old friend of&#xD;
mine willing to~stand a 'drink.'"&#xD;
A bevy of the' corps de ballet immediately surrounded Maud,&#xD;
~nd her friend the Viscount, and~ subdued laughter~ jokes, and&#xD;
smart sayings, were freely exchanged, while a "super," who had&#xD;
been hovering around the group in the hope of earning a trifle,&#xD;
w~s dispatched for the wine.&#xD;
Among the corephees there was a vacancy, that vacancy was&#xD;
caused by the absence of Marian LivimmgsL~n, who had been con-&#xD;
versing with' Mr. Villiers at the wing-a young lady who diffei'ed&#xD;
in many respects fron~ those by whom she was surrounded. 2&#xD;
The wine arrived, and the chaste nymphs had each a bumper.&#xD;
In their hearts they would have preferred gin; but there is a&#xD;
class of females who think that wine is genteel to c~%ll for, and&#xD;
they drink it, though they would have given decided preferences&#xD;
to a drop of something " short."&#xD;
In the meantime the rehearsal of the melodrama had concluded,&#xD;
and the stage cleared for the ballet.&#xD;
The prompter's bell, and the manager's voice, cut the orgie short,&#xD;
and the admiring crowd round the Viscount broke up and hastened&#xD;
to their respective stations.&#xD;
Deserted by his companions, the Viscount drank another glass&#xD;
tr so, and rose a little unsteady, though.perfectly coherent.&#xD;
At this moment Marian Livingston came across the stage, and&#xD;
made her way towards the dressing-room; in order to do this, she&#xD;
had to pass the partially intoxicated nobleman.&#xD;
"I say, my love," cried the Viscount, "come here, and take a&#xD;
glass of wine. Come here-d6n't be prudish. By Jove! you'r&amp;amp;&#xD;
the prettiest girl in the theatre."&#xD;
The Ballet Girl stopped short, and looked at th~ man-who ad-&#xD;
dressed her with unutterable scorn. Then she inquired with&#xD;
cutting contempt-&#xD;
"Did you address me, sir,~&#xD;
"Of course I did, my charmer. How could I ever look at another&#xD;
woman when you aje near?"&#xD;
"Keep your compliments for those who haed them," was the&#xD;
answer she vouchsafed him.&#xD;
The Viscount placed himself before her.&#xD;
."Stop" he said '~ I shall not allow you to run away like this.&#xD;
You are a pretty little creature, amid we must know each other&#xD;
better."&#xD;
"Will you allow me to pass?"&#xD;
"No. Y~ do not know wl~o or what I am," he replied.&#xD;
"Yes, Ido know what you are."&#xD;
"What am I, then?"&#xD;
"A low blackguard."&#xD;
The Viscount had approached close to her, and had extended.&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
his arm to draw the girl towards him, but ere his fingers had&#xD;
touched her, she had dealt him a well.directed backhand blow&#xD;
upon the face, which knocked off his hat, and made the amorous&#xD;
nobleman stagger, holding~ his handkerchief to his bleeding nose.&#xD;
He was too much astonished and hurt to. speak, and the ballet&#xD;
girl passed on with heaving bosom, and flashing eye, not heeding'&#xD;
his muttered curses, or the surpr# of those around who had&#xD;
witnessed the fracas&#xD;
Hastening to the dressing-room, Marian Livingston hurriedly&#xD;
donned her usAal wearing apparel, and left the theatre.&#xD;
"Do you know the 'swell' you struck?" asked the stag'e-door&#xD;
keel~er of the girl as she pa~sedl out.&#xD;
"Not I."&#xD;
"Why it is Viscount Rakeborough, a regular nob about town."&#xD;
"Don't care who he was," replied Marian, defiantly. "gentleman&#xD;
or no o'entlen served as serve man&#xD;
b     ian, I         him     [ will     any     w~io&#xD;
insults me."&#xD;
"Hollo! who did you say she struck ~" cried Mi'. Bowers, who&#xD;
was smoking a cigar just without the stage-door, and who had&#xD;
heard the conversation. "Viscount iRakebo~ough! The bare idea&#xD;
of a l~atron of the drama being insulted in my theatre ! I won't&#xD;
have any gentleman insulted by a low upstart hussy, like you&#xD;
You ought to think it an honor if real gentleman like that take&#xD;
any notice of you. But you shall leave my theatre for it, and&#xD;
without your fortnight's notice. Your money will be at "treasury"&#xD;
for you on Saturday; but don't you show your face here either&#xD;
before or after that."&#xD;
"But, Mr. Bowers-" began the trembling girl.&#xD;
"Not another word miss." roared the manager. "I have said it.&#xD;
Now be off !&#xD;
The Ballet Girl left the theatre with a heavy heart, while Mr.&#xD;
Bowers hastened to condole with the noble (?) "patron of the&#xD;
drama," and inform him that he had dismissed the author of his&#xD;
discomfort.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
THROWN UPON THE WORLD--A BAD WOMAN.-THE BALLET GIRL TREADS&#xD;
UPON DANGEROUS GROUND.&#xD;
DESTITUTE and forlorn, cast upqn the cold, pitiless world.&#xD;
without a friend or a roof be-ne~th which she could~ shelter her&#xD;
'head, Marian's footsteps ch(1 not falter as she ~vandered along. She&#xD;
crossed Westminister Bridge, and gazed at the dark water, which&#xD;
splashed and foamed beneath the arches. with a half longing to cast&#xD;
herself into the cool, mysterious depths of the river, and so sink in-&#xD;
to oblivion the troubles and anxieties of her worldly existence.&#xD;

&#xD;
b&#xD;
&#xD;
But a moment's thought brought back her dormant spirit, and&#xD;
convinced her of the sinfulness of her wish, and, with a shudder, she&#xD;
turned and hurried across the bridge.&#xD;
'But after walking about the streets for some time, Without any&#xD;
defined purpose, she at length sat herself do~Vn upon a doorstep.&#xD;
She was now in the squalid neighborhood of St. Giles', not far&#xD;
from those seven branching thoroughfares, which, converging upon&#xD;
a common centre, give it the name of the Seven Dials.&#xD;
Marian began to cry. This was a common spectacle, and attract-&#xD;
ed but little attention.&#xD;
What should she do? To whom apply?&#xD;
She looked at her purse, and found that she had five shillings and.&#xD;
a few half-pence. Yes! she would take a lodging, procure some&#xD;
I shelter ere nightfall, and in the morning seek for work, for though&#xD;
she was poor, she was proud, and would not, could not, accept the&#xD;
fortnight offered at the Royal Victoria Theatre, after the insult's that&#xD;
Mr. Bowers had heaped upon her head.&#xD;
Yes, she would do this; and, with this purpose in view, with re-&#xD;
newed energy, she resumed her wanderings.&#xD;
She went and timidly knocked at the doors of more than one house&#xD;
in Soho, wherever she saw a card displayed informing the passers-&#xD;
by that "Furnished Lodgings "were to be had by applying within.&#xD;
But she looked so miserable and forlorn, that at all' the places&#xD;
she applied the people made some excuse for not taking her. She&#xD;
had no luggage and no references.&#xD;
What was she to do?&#xD;
She turned from the last house she had gone to, heart sick, weary,&#xD;
and utterly worn out.&#xD;
She had no alternative; she must either apply to the workhouse&#xD;
or spend the night in the cold, pitiless streets.&#xD;
She had not the courage to pursue the former course, and she&#xD;
was too inexperienced in the ways of the world to know what to do&#xD;
for the best.&#xD;
So she continued on her way, sobbing to herself. By-and-bye&#xD;
she stopped before the Royalty Theatre in Dean street, and gazed&#xD;
vacantly upon the occupants of the various carriages as they alighted&#xD;
and entered the theatre.&#xD;
rllhe handsome haughty dames, and their well-dressed cavaliers,&#xD;
the "childi~en favored by fortune," How bright and happy they&#xD;
looked as they swept by the slightly clad form of our unfortunate&#xD;
heroine!&#xD;
They seemed to have all that is desirable in life, and to enj6y&#xD;
most thoroughly the gifts that the "fickle o'oddess" showered so&#xD;
plentifully upon them. But perhaps they were not so happy as&#xD;
they appeared ; half those gay ladies and dashing' gentlemen had a&#xD;
"skeleton in their homes," had some sorrow, some crime, secretly&#xD;
gnawing like a cancer into their hearts.&#xD;
Much is said by the virtuous inhabitants of the world about the&#xD;
sins and profligacy of the, poor. But who speaks about the rich?&#xD;
Yet it must be obvious to the meanest capacity that in some cases&#xD;
the members of the pampered aristocracy are a thousand times&#xD;
&#xD;
Secrets of a Young Girl.&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
worse than those who rank beneath them in the social scale; and t~&#xD;
substantiate what we advance, the gentle reader is referred to the&#xD;
disgraceful scenes and terrible profligacy that daily come to light in&#xD;
our divorce courts.&#xD;
The upper ten thousand can have no excuse for their sins, they&#xD;
have been well and carefully nurtured, have received the best of&#xD;
education, and unlike the poor man, they cannot plead "ignorance"&#xD;
as the cause of their crimes.&#xD;
How often do we hear of some lordling taking a fancy to the&#xD;
pretty face of some fair girl, of gaining her affections, then sudden-&#xD;
ly tiring of her, thrusts her forth upon the world, with his child in&#xD;
her bosom, for all to point the finger of scorn and cox4uinely&#xD;
at her!&#xD;
What is the poor, betrayed creature to do? None will employ&#xD;
her. None assist her.&#xD;
Oh! how sad it is to contemplate the cruelty of human nature.&#xD;
If a man or a woman once lose their caste in society through&#xD;
poverty or misfortune, how soon the hard hearted pitiless world is;&#xD;
upon them, and, lest they should attempt to regain their position,:&#xD;
how ready, how eager, to trample them still deeper into the mire !~&#xD;
In this world there is no forgiveness for the erring brother or&#xD;
sister; there only hope is in that merciful Being above, who dis-&#xD;
penses justice to all evenly.&#xD;
A girl placed in this bitter, cruel position~ must go upon the towm.&#xD;
and add another to the daily increasing members of the "frail.&#xD;
sisterhood" that reproach and blot upon society.&#xD;
And then she must die, miserable, alone, and friendless, while&#xD;
her seducer is elsewhere pursuing h~s diabolical art, and not be-&#xD;
stowing a thought upon his wretched victim.&#xD;
Had Marion been less virtuous and good than she was~ she would&#xD;
have resorted to that mode of living which any other girl "thrown&#xD;
upon the world" would have taken up.&#xD;
But 'though she was a ballet dancer, she was naturally pure 1w&#xD;
mind and body. and it would have been an impossibility for her to&#xD;
have stooped to anything that was low or debase.&#xD;
It must not be supposed that we are holding our heroine up as&#xD;
the only g'oocl and uncorrupted girl in the "ranks of the l~allet."'&#xD;
No, far from it.&#xD;
The dancers have certainly got a bad name, and 'why?&#xD;
The answer to this question is a mystery that we cannot solve;&#xD;
suffice to say that it has been our lot to have seen so much of this&#xD;
class, and an immense amount of good, and very little bad, have we&#xD;
noticed.&#xD;
If one of their companions is ill. or preveiitedl from taking' an,&#xD;
engagement. who so ready to subscribe as the "ballet girl "?&#xD;
Who earns from eighteen to five and twenty shillings a week, and&#xD;
out of that has to find her silk stockings, her slippers, her paint,&#xD;
and often, beside herself, h~s to support an aged parent, perhaps~&#xD;
bedridden, and some half dozen brothers and sisters?&#xD;
Why, the "ballet girl."&#xD;
Yes, dear reader, this is of every day occurrence, and yet many of&#xD;

&#xD;
these girls prefer a crust of bread and slavery, to a life of indolence&#xD;
and infamy.&#xD;
Marian moralized over this and the people that she had seen&#xD;
enter the theatre.&#xD;
"Oh!" she muttered, "did but son~e of these people know of my&#xD;
poverty and helplessness, they would surely help me in my distress,&#xD;
but alas! the world is so cruel, cold and selfish, that it would be-&#xD;
stow no thought upon me." Ever is it so; the rich are always&#xD;
ready to trample down the poor under their feet.&#xD;
They will send out large sums of money and bales of clothing for&#xD;
as avage set of tattooed cannibals, in some, far-off Indian Isle, and&#xD;
while there are man'y who' would subscribe a handsome sum toward&#xD;
this, there are but few who look at home and think of their ne-&#xD;
glected native destitution.&#xD;
The girls reverie was suddenly interr~1~~~. by~a woman of about&#xD;
1flf~4i&#xD;
forty years of a~'e;. sh'~ had evidently at one time been very hand-&#xD;
some, but now her features were furrowed and worn from the&#xD;
effects of constant dissipation.&#xD;
"Its a nice evening, my dear," she said, touching Marian on the&#xD;
arm, and looking hard at her.&#xD;
"Yes it is ma'am," replied our heroine, abstractedly.&#xD;
"You seemed tired, dear ; 'ha~ve you been walking far?&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"I suppose that you are going home now, eh?~'&#xD;
At the mention of the sweet word, home, Marian thought of her&#xD;
lonely position, and burst into tears.&#xD;
"Hey, clay! my clear, what is this-crying? here, come into a&#xD;
quiet street, and tell me all about it," and the woman, beckoning to&#xD;
Marian, walked up the st~reet.&#xD;
Marian followed her, almost mechanically into Richmond Build-&#xD;
ings.&#xD;
"Now, my dear, tell me all about your little trouble, and I will&#xD;
do all I can to help you. I have taken a liking for you, and may&#xD;
be able to assist you.&#xD;
.~" Oh thank you, ma'am, I am so grateful," sobbed Marian,&#xD;
hardly liking the manner, of the woman yet not, knowing what to&#xD;
do.&#xD;
"Well tell~n~ all," said the woman, in a caressing tone.&#xD;
Thus encouraged, Marian, in a few words as possible, told her&#xD;
story, without mentioning names. merely saying she had been&#xD;
turned from the house because she had left the theatre.~&#xD;
"Well, my dear," said the woman, when she had concluded, "I&#xD;
am not rich, but you appear to be deserving of assistance; I live in&#xD;
Soho Square, and you can reside with me, if you like until you get&#xD;
something to do. Will you come?"&#xD;
"Yes," cried Marian;&#xD;
The poor girl was so utterly ~worn out that she could not bring&#xD;
her mind to consider whether she was doing right or wrong.&#xD;
Oh! could she but have done so. Had her good angel bid her&#xD;
hesitate, how much misery and suffering would she have been&#xD;
spared.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
t~AUGIIT IN TIlE TOIL5.-DANGER.-A TERRIBLE HOUSE.&#xD;
MARIAN followed her conductress into a turning near Soho Square,&#xD;
and stopped before a large handsome-looking' house; the latter g'ave&#xD;
a sharp double knock, and the door was opened by a smart lookiPg&#xD;
servant maid.&#xD;
"Are the young ladies all within?" asked onr heroine's companion.&#xD;
"Yes, Madam."&#xD;
"Come along, my clear, and let me introduce ~Q1i to my daugh-&#xD;
ters," said the woman, as she opened the parlor door, and ushered&#xD;
our heroine into the room.&#xD;
Seated around the table were three young ladies, playing some&#xD;
strange game with cards, fi'om which they seemed to derive con-&#xD;
siclerablo amusement. They were all handsome, but they were so&#xD;
totally unlike each other that it was almost an impossibility for&#xD;
any one to take them for sisters ' and upon their features there was&#xD;
an impudent, brazen expression that ma(le the casual observer wis~h&#xD;
to inquire into the particulars of their past lives.&#xD;
Now, my clears, I have brought you a companion; she is very&#xD;
lonely and unhappy, and you must take care of her, and do your&#xD;
best to make her cheerful."&#xD;
"Oh, yes, madam, we will," chorused the girls, rising to welcome&#xD;
Marian, and making room for her to sit beside ~heni.&#xD;
"Now, my dear," said Madame iRosini, "do not be so clown-&#xD;
hearted; with your nice looks you need not be long in this abode;&#xD;
you are not at all likely to suffer neglect as long as there are men&#xD;
in the world "&#xD;
"I do not quite understand you," replied Marian. The three&#xD;
youug ladies laughed, and looked significantly at each othev.&#xD;
"You will some day, clear," said Madame ]Iiosini, with a sort of&#xD;
contempt in her tone at Marian's innocence. Of course we niust&#xD;
do the best that we can, and you may depend upon niy affection&#xD;
for you.':&#xD;
"Ak! you are kind and good."&#xD;
"Well, well, perhaps I am, perhaps I ain't; but that's neither&#xD;
here.nor there-I--I don't waiit you to say anything of that sort&#xD;
my dear; but if ~OU are pnldlent. and trust to me, and follow my&#xD;
advice, you will do very well indeed.&#xD;
"Oh, madam, while I am with you let me work. I cannot eat the&#xD;
bread of idleness after you have been so kiiid to me. No. no, wel-&#xD;
come any toil rather than that." Madame Rosiiii twined one of the&#xD;
long and beautiful ringlets of Mariaii round her fingers as she said,&#xD;
"Don't be alarmed ; you will do well enough if you are wise enough.&#xD;
Let those toil 'that can't help it. You leave your future to me."&#xD;
"You are too kind to me."&#xD;
"Not at ~dl. Now, yout stay where you are; nobody will inter-&#xD;
rupt you here. I hiaye business just now to attend to, but you will,&#xD;
no doubt, be very well able to amuse yourself while I ani away, and I&#xD;
~will think over what I can do for you. You are too delicate for&#xD;

work, Ii can easily see, so we must think of something else for you...&#xD;
By-the-bye, a cousin of mine will be here to-morrow, and we will.&#xD;
take his advice."&#xD;
"A cousin?"&#xD;
"Yes, and then we will talk it over together."&#xD;
"Is she good and kind?"&#xD;
"She! it's ~.1 gentleman.."&#xD;
"Indeed!"&#xD;
"Yes, to be sure. Did you never hear of gentlemen cousins?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes, yes! But..-&#xD;
"Why, what now?"&#xD;
"I don't seem to think- I don't exactly like taking a stranger,&#xD;
and a gentleman into the confidence of my position. Ah, it will.&#xD;
be so much better, without any consultations or conferences at alh&#xD;
to give me so much work to do, as will prevent me being a burden&#xD;
to you. You do not know how clever I am. I can, indeed, work&#xD;
nicely."&#xD;
"Pho, nonsense. You don't know what you, are talking about..&#xD;
You must just leave all to me, and I will do what is best, you may&#xD;
depend upon that; so now I must be off, for I have a thousand&#xD;
things to do." And so saying, Madame iRosini left the room, an4&#xD;
our heroine shortly afterwards expressed a desire for sleep, ,and was~&#xD;
shown to her chamber by one of the girls.&#xD;
Next morning Madame Rosini awoke our heroine about half-past.&#xD;
ten o'clock.&#xD;
"Did you sleep comfortably, my child?" she asked.&#xD;
"Yes, Madame, very comfortably indeed."&#xD;
"That is all right, ilow. I will send you up some coffee and a&#xD;
,n~ce hot roll, and then you must come down to my dressing-room."~~&#xD;
Half-an-hour afterwards our heroine was closeted with the mistress~&#xD;
of the house.                     e&#xD;
"I want to show you some things. Come this way. I want to&#xD;
see how you become dress, for that dowdy affair you have on is not&#xD;
worth the name."&#xD;
It was in vain that Marian protested she was contented with the&#xD;
dress she had on until she could manage by her own exertion to get&#xD;
more. Madame Rosini would take her into her into her own dressing-&#xD;
room, and then summoning Miss Warren (one of the young ladies.&#xD;
our .heroine had seen the previous night). a mysterious sort of con-&#xD;
ference was held with her which resulted in some costly dresses&#xD;
being brought and tried on Marian, and finally one was set aside&#xD;
with the remark from Madame Rosin.i, "that it would do for the&#xD;
evening very well."&#xD;
Marion trembled, she knew not why, as this evening approached&#xD;
and before nine o'clock at night, when she was directed to dre~s&#xD;
herself, and Madame IRosini handed her out a very elegant set of*&#xD;
opals to wear, she began to feel very much the sensation as though&#xD;
she was a sort of prisoner.&#xD;
"Indeed, Madame iRosini," she safd, "I would rather not wear&#xD;
these jewels, if you will permit me. And let me beg of you likewise&#xD;
to excuse my seeing your cousin."&#xD;

"Not see my cousin! Not see Mr. Smith !"&#xD;
"Indeed, I would rather not. I am sad at heart, and ask noth-&#xD;
ing further of you than your protection and your permission to&#xD;
earn my bread."&#xD;
"Pho! What nonsense you talk, my dear! Who knows but as&#xD;
your face is your fortune, you may get a first-rate husband one of~&#xD;
thesedays."&#xD;
"Nono! Ohno!"&#xD;
"Don't say that. But it is the way with you all. It is always&#xD;
no, no, when nothing else is in your thoughts; I insist upon your&#xD;
wearing the jewels, and shall be seriously angry with you if you&#xD;
don't."&#xD;
There was so much reality in the rapidly rising anger of&#xD;
Madame Rosini, that l~vfarian, with a sigh, put on the jewels and the&#xD;
rich dress, and when Madame Rosini swung forward a cheval glass.&#xD;
which reflected her whole figure, she could not but be struck with&#xD;
the correct taste with which they had adorned her.&#xD;
Custom and experience had enabled Madame Rosini to know&#xD;
what would look best on the delicate and syl~h-like form of Marian;.&#xD;
she said, with a satisfied nod, "Yes, that will do. My dear, you are&#xD;
faultless-I wonder' what people could be thinking of to neglect.&#xD;
you so.&#xD;
Madame Rosini had sent a mysterious note to Mr. Smith, and had&#xD;
received a mysterious answer during the day, and now, at ten o'clock&#xD;
precisely, a very elegant and recherche little repast was served up&#xD;
in one of the drawing-rooms.                    /&#xD;
4nd a sudden stoppage of a cab, on the footboard which was a&#xD;
tiger of the smallest size and most elaborate "get up," announced&#xD;
an arrival.&#xD;
"My cousin," said Madame IRosini. Now, my dear, you will see~&#xD;
a gentleman of good judgement alld experience, on whose good will&#xD;
you may rely."&#xD;
"But, madame, what do I want with good will? It is very kind&#xD;
of you. but yet&#xD;
"Hush! my dear. He is here."&#xD;
Miss Warren did the honors of the staircase to 1\Ir. Smith, and&#xD;
announced him, with an air and manner of mysterious respect that.&#xD;
was &amp;amp;lthite startling.&#xD;
Mr. Smith entered the room with a light step and in reply to the&#xD;
deep courtesy of Madame Rosini, cousin merely condescended to&#xD;
say-&#xD;
"How do?"&#xD;
He was a man past, and only just past, the prime of life. An&#xD;
iron grey tinge, had touched his hair and the moustache looked&#xD;
suspicious of some infallible hair dye ; in dress he was plain, yet&#xD;
co.~jy, and the flash of diamonds caine from his breast and fingers.&#xD;
"My niece, Cousin Smith," said Maclame IRosini, laying an env&#xD;
phases on the cousin.&#xD;
"Ah," said Mr. Smith, as he lifted an eye-glass, and took a steady&#xD;
look at Marian. "Ali!&#xD;
There was a slight, nervous flutter about the manner of Madame&#xD;

iRosini, while Mr. Smith made what appeared to be a critical ex-&#xD;
amination of the fair girl, who little suspected she had been decked&#xD;
out to please his eye; but when he nodded, and made a half sort&#xD;
of a bow, and smiled, Madame IRosini smiled, and appeared greatly&#xD;
relieved.&#xD;
"I am delighted to see you, Miss-a-a-&#xD;
"Marian Livingston," said madame.&#xD;
"Ab, yes I am quite delighted. Pray be seated. And so you&#xD;
have been good enough, madame, to prepare a little supper for us&#xD;
all three. I am really charmed-ah, yes, quite charmed."&#xD;
Marion bowed to the strange cousin, and sat down. The deli-&#xD;
cately-prepared and nicely-served supper was soon discussed that&#xD;
is to say, Madame Rosini partook of it plentifully-Marian sparingly,&#xD;
and Mr. S~iiith turned over two morsels of chicken o~ his plate and&#xD;
consumed one.&#xD;
But the wine had some charm for Mr. Smith, if the chicken had&#xD;
none. On takin~~ it he elevated his eyes, and said-&#xD;
"Ah, from my own people."&#xD;
"Yes, cousin," said Madame Rosini, "I know you are rather par-&#xD;
ticular .with regard to your wine."&#xD;
"Decidedly."&#xD;
"So I thought it better to go to the proper people, and say it was&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
Cousin Smith nodded approval, and filled his glass.&#xD;
"Oh, if you please, madame," said Miss Warren, appearing at the thres-&#xD;
hold of the door, "you are wanted down stairs."&#xD;
"how very provoking Cousin Smith, will you excuse me for a few&#xD;
minutes.&#xD;
"Of course."&#xD;
Marian rose, too, as Madame hiosini did; bat the latter almost pushed her&#xD;
iiito her seat, as she said-&#xD;
"You stay with Cousin Smith, and just tell him all your story, and he will&#xD;
advise. I shall be back soon."&#xD;
Nay," said Marian, "I have no story, and no need of advice."&#xD;
"Pho, pho !"&#xD;
Madame Rosini winked, frox~rned, and shook her head at Marian so dis-&#xD;
paragingly, as regarded her leaving the room, that the girl, whose heart was&#xD;
as free from guilt as an infant's, and who had the impulse to do what others&#xD;
wished her, sunk back into her seat again with a tinn(l look of indecision.&#xD;
Another moment and she was alone with Mr. Smith.&#xD;
A blind sort of smile, which exhibited all his teeth, c~inme over the counten-&#xD;
ance of the cousin and be poured out another glass of ~vine for himself and&#xD;
one for Marian, as he said-&#xD;
"Well, my dear. what are expectations, my dear, that is all. You are a&#xD;
charming young creature and I am only all amuazemnent to know how on earth&#xD;
Rosini found you ? You have some&#xD;
your parents were in the country." story to tell, I fancy. I think she said&#xD;
I have no friends sir, but Madame Rosini."&#xD;
"Nay, pray include me, if you please." Marian bowed.&#xD;
'Well, tell me all about it. A little love affair I suppose."&#xD;
Sir!&#xD;
I say a little love ailair. I fancy it was."&#xD;
"I Don't understand you, sir,"&#xD;
Oh. stuff ! What is the use now of playing the coy maiden in this way.&#xD;
11 am one of the most liberal of men, as you will find. In fact, you need not&#xD;
have a whim ungratified, if yoa like ; nor am I inconsistent either, without&#xD;
good cause. Come now, what do you say?"&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
Marian with her slender fingers round the stein of the glass that&#xD;
was before her, gazed across the table into the face of cousin Smith,&#xD;
with a vague idea that she was in the presence of a lunatic whom it&#xD;
might be dangerous to irritate.&#xD;
The prominent idea in her mind was to get out of the room.&#xD;
"If you please," she said, "I should like to see Madame Rosini."&#xD;
She rose as she spoke.&#xD;
"No, no, by no means," said Mr. Synith, springing from his seat.&#xD;
"There really is no occasion. I will settle everything with her, and&#xD;
she will have no cause of complaint, There is no occasion for any&#xD;
consultation. Look upon it as settled."&#xD;
" Upon what, sir, as settled?" said Marian, as she looked into the&#xD;
eyes of cousin Smith, with a clear, inimocent gaze that was far 'too&#xD;
natural to be acted, and xvhich fairly staggered the titled roue-for&#xD;
such he was-and threw him off his balaAce for a moment.&#xD;
"'Why-why--i--that-that is-that you know-" Marian shook her&#xD;
head sadly.&#xD;
"On&#xD;
adorable life," said cousin'-~mith, "you are a charming, exquisite,&#xD;
girl. I really and truly love you. There is a Pidluant&#xD;
innocence about you that is as fresh as the scent of early roses. I shall&#xD;
-I do admire you-mistress of my heart, my fortune. There is&#xD;
nothing in all the world that your utmost caprice can long' for that&#xD;
shall not be yours. The life that is before you shall be a romance.&#xD;
I never loved till now; I have been cold, indifferent, jaded, but now&#xD;
I love with all my heart."&#xD;
He sprang towards her, and Marian, with a cry of alarm, flew to-&#xD;
wards the window, he being between her and the door.&#xD;
"No, no!" she said. "I pray not. What is the meaning of this?&#xD;
Oh, sir, if you are a gentleman-"&#xD;
"A gentleman? I am a nobleman. And were I ten times more&#xD;
noble than I am, I should be the slave of your fascinations. My&#xD;
adorable girl! you shall be mine and mine only."&#xD;
"Help! help!"&#xD;
Cousin Smith, by a judicious feint in one direction, had baffled&#xD;
Marian, and darted round the table, and caught her round the&#xD;
wtist, but she was close to the window which was a French one,&#xD;
and to dash it open, despite the blind was the work of a moment.&#xD;
"Save me! save me !" she cried.&#xD;
"This is coquetry carried too far," said cousin Smith. "My&#xD;
dear, you will attract notice from the street."&#xD;
Madame ilosini rushed into the room, and by main force tore&#xD;
Marian from the window and closed it.&#xD;
"Are you mad, girl?" she said, "that you would draw attention&#xD;
my house. Are you mad! I say?"&#xD;
"Ak, thank Heaven you are here," said Marian. "You do not&#xD;
know-you cannot know this man,"&#xD;
"Hush !. hush!&#xD;
"I will not hush, I am slow of suspicion, but I feel that it is in-&#xD;
famy to listen to him, or to breathe the air of his presence. If this&#xD;
is the sort of protection you offer me, welcome the streets of Lon-&#xD;
don, even if I have to beg for my bread. Welcome even the rarity&#xD;

"I thro~v my fortune at your feet" said Mr. Smith.&#xD;
"And I despise it sir, as I despise you."&#xD;
"Hush! hush! " said Mad anie iRosini again. "What is all this&#xD;
about? Oh! cousin Smith, you are too precipitate.&#xD;

Miss Warren burst into the room-                      N&#xD;
"Oh! madame, madame."&#xD;
"What! what! "&#xD;
"A man, a gentleman' asking' foi' Miss TAvingston.~&#xD;
"For me!" cried Marian. b&#xD;
"No!" shrieked Madame IRosini.&#xD;
"Confound him!" said Cousin Smith.&#xD;
"And he says," gasped Miss Warren, "that he will see her, that&#xD;
he must see her, that he heard her call from the window, that he&#xD;
knew her, that he-"&#xD;
A tumult below was heard.&#xD;
"Help!" cried Marian.&#xD;
Madame Rosini flew upon her jike an enraged tigress, and with&#xD;
the strength that no one would have thought her to possess, she&#xD;
caughtt our heroine round the waist, and fairly lifted her oft' the&#xD;
floor.&#xD;
"The panelled door, Warren," she cried.&#xD;
"Yes, madame," replied the girl.&#xD;
A door, the whole panel of which is a looking-glass was flung&#xD;
4open by Miss Warren, and through it dashed Madame iRosini with&#xD;
Marian. Miss Warren followed, and when madame had thrown the&#xD;
half insensible girl down upon a bench, cried-&#xD;
"Hold her! tie her!" anything to quiet her. There, hold her&#xD;
hands. Ah, that will do! Now my dainty pipe of goods,' you will&#xD;
~call out, will you!"&#xD;
Madame I~osini with some dexterity; and greht speed, tied a hand-&#xD;
kerchief ovei~ the mouth of Marian; and fastened her hands behind&#xD;
her; with another she then struck her a blow, which in the girl's&#xD;
terrified state almost stunned her, and she fell nearly insensible to&#xD;
the floor, close by the bench.&#xD;
"Come!" said Madame iRosini, and Miss Warren immediately&#xD;
followed her into the upper room again. Cousin Smith was stand-&#xD;
ing by the window, and at the moment the two women entered the&#xD;
room, the ordinary ~door of the apartment was dashed open, and&#xD;
'George Villiers, the actor of the Royal Victoria Theatre, abruptly&#xD;
enter~ed.&#xD;
"Pardon my intrusion," said he, but I heard a cry from this&#xD;
window. I knew the voice, I partially saw the form. It is a young&#xD;
lady whom I slightly know, and she was calling for help, I demand&#xD;
'to see her at once."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do you know, sir," said Cousin Smith, "that your coming&#xD;
there is a great intrusion?&#xD;
"And pray, sir," said Madame Rosini, "who may you be, that&#xD;
you take upon yourself to rush into people's houses in this way,&#xD;
without the slightest knowledge of them, and without their leave?"&#xD;
"'Who I am, matters 4tle. I heard a cry of help, I guessed who&#xD;
it came from; and I am here to assist the young lady."&#xD;
"Fetch a policeman, 'Warren," said Madame Rosini.&#xD;
"Oh, madame! " said Miss 'Warren, "perhaps the gentleman may&#xD;
be mistaken after all, and when he ownS to it, he may apologize:&#xD;
~ c~oi2t know you~ sir, and you can have no right ~o claim me, and&#xD;
if I choose, while playing at forfeits with my cousin here and&#xD;
Mac1am~e IRosini, to get to the window, and open it and cry hell), to&#xD;
get back my bracehet-foi' that was what I had to du-what is that&#xD;
to you, sir, eli! 'eli ! eli ?"&#xD;
Miss 'Warren, after this ingenious speech kept saying, "eh! eli !"&#xD;
and approached at each eli! a closer to the strano'er till he&#xD;
found himself fairly backed to the door.&#xD;
"You?" he said.&#xD;
"Yes, me; what then, sir?"&#xD;
"Look to the plate basket," ci'ied Madame iRosini.&#xD;
"Sir," aaid cousin Smith, "it strikes me that you are in a very&#xD;
ridiculous position. Surely in our own private house we may amuse&#xD;
ourselves, without folks running from the street to question us."&#xD;
"Indeed!"&#xD;
"Yes indeed, sir," added m~dame.&#xD;
"Oh, very well, madame, I may have been mistaken. It may be&#xD;
~o, very well. As you have a right to know who I am, I leave my&#xD;
card~ and wish you a very good day."&#xD;
"Mr. George Vilhiers "-read Madanie Rosini, after the young&#xD;
man had departed~ "Who is he? he has the appearance of an actor.&#xD;
INow, my Lord Duke," she continued to cousin Smith-" why have&#xD;
you spoiled all by being so precipitate? I warned your Grace."&#xD;
"Nay, I protest."&#xD;
"Oh, I did, I did. I don't know how I shall manage now; it is&#xD;
no use your staying here. Your Grace" had better go, and I will&#xD;
communicate with you."&#xD;
Cousin Smith, or his Grace, which ever m~ame he was best entitled&#xD;
~o, beckoned Madame IRosini aside- "That girl must be mine, if&#xD;
she costs half my fortune. You understand. Good night."&#xD;
Madame iRosini nodded, and in a few moments more the cab that&#xD;
had been waiting at the corner of the square for cousin Smith,&#xD;
whirled away at a violent pace that almost projected the tigei~ from&#xD;
his perch behind into a shop.&#xD;

THE ESCAPE FROM THE SECOND-FLOOR WINDOW.-LONDON AT NIGHT.&#xD;
WHEN our heroine came to herself, she found that she was lying&#xD;
in a bed, and Madame Rosini was by her side, bathing her temples&#xD;
with vinegar and water.&#xD;
"Are you hitter now, my dear?" inquired that amiable person.&#xD;
"Yes niadame! But oh! what harm have I done that you should&#xD;
treat me thus badly-~thds cruelly?"&#xD;
"I treat you cruelly? You little fool, had I[ not don9 so, had we not&#xD;
silenced you, you would have been the ruin of us all. Truly it was&#xD;
a good return to me for kindness. That you endeavored to expose&#xD;
your benefactress to every idle foot that ru~is after you."&#xD;
"Let me leave this house I shall not stay here longer."&#xD;
"You shall not leave here; why, what do you want C? Here you&#xD;
can have the best of clothes, of food, money, and all like the finest&#xD;
ladies in the kingdom ; but yet, to indulge' in your infernal prudery&#xD;
you throw up ~ll this, and would sooner live in the streets."&#xD;
"Aye, madame! a life of poverty, rendered happy by the know-&#xD;
ledge of my own virtue, is far preferable to a career of riches and&#xD;
infamy, made miserable by the stings ~f a remorseful conscience."&#xD;
',' For the love of heaven, do not talk 'in that sentimental and&#xD;
ridiculously romantic manner; it is the effect of your stage educa-&#xD;
tion, and the sooner you leave it off, the better it will be. lit does&#xD;
very well in a Yictoria melodrama, or Mr. Mudie's three-volume&#xD;
novels; but when you talk about virtue' in our city, at the present&#xD;
day, you talk as if von were an idiot."&#xD;
"No, madame, my hGnor is dearer to me than my life ; revile as&#xD;
you will, but in the name of mercy let me l&amp;amp;ave this house.&#xD;
"Don't talk nonsense, girl; cousin Smith will be here again to-&#xD;
morrow, and if you play your cards properly, undoubtedly, you will&#xD;
make a good thing out of it."&#xD;
"I will not see him," said Marian.&#xD;
"You shall," said Madame iRosini, with a dangerous glitter in her&#xD;
eyes. "Do you think you will gain the best of me with your petty&#xD;
strength of mind? You are not the first wayward damsel that I&#xD;
have had here, and brought to reason too."&#xD;
"I defy , amid loathe you! almost screamed Marian, rising in the&#xD;
bed "I defy you, vile woman!"&#xD;
"Ha! ha! my dainty bird, we'll see; you are well caged. I will&#xD;
now leave you to think over what I have said; if you take my advice,&#xD;
you will accede to it,"&#xD;
And Madame IRosini sallied out of the room, closed the door after&#xD;
her, double-locking it, leaving Marian to her own thoughts.&#xD;
IJufortunate girl! she seemed destined to fall from one adventure&#xD;
into another! She must escape from the place. But how? She&#xD;
arose from her recumbent position and tried' the door.&#xD;
No ! it was firmly locked and seemed plated with iron; she&#xD;
stooped down and peered tlnough the key hold; and she could see&#xD;
nothing but the most impenetrable darkness.&#xD;

&#xD;
Then she went to 'the window and looked out. The moon shone&#xD;
brightly, and she could see that she was on the second floor, some&#xD;
five and thirty feet from the pavement below. Yes, if she escaped&#xD;
at all she must do it by the window~&#xD;
Her plan of action was speedily arranged. She would wait until&#xD;
all was quiet, and then descend by the aid of her sheets and blankets&#xD;
into the streets below; sh~ had no fear of accident in her perilous&#xD;
journey, for many a time as a fairy in a panton1ine, had she descen-&#xD;
ded from the top of the 'stage, with nothing to clipg to but a&#xD;
slender sire.&#xD;
She then commenced to take the blankets and sheets from, off the&#xD;
bed, these, with the aid of her pocket scissors, she cut into strips,&#xD;
twisted firmly and fastened together so as. to form one long rope;&#xD;
she me~lsured it and found it was over forty feet in length, she then&#xD;
tested its strength by fastening it round a large iron hook that she&#xD;
found in the ceiling, and hanging upon each ,length separately, ~until&#xD;
she was convinced that it would bear her weight, then she put it&#xD;
aside; then, fastening one end of the huge rope around a heavy&#xD;
chest of drawers, which she drew up to the open window, then she&#xD;
blew out her light, and p~'epam'ecl to descend.&#xD;
Tightly grasping it, the courageous girl gradually lowered herself&#xD;
until her head wa~ upon a level with the windokv sill.&#xD;
For a few minutes the rope swayed to and fro. and threatened to&#xD;
dash our brave adventuress to the ground, but she clung to it, and&#xD;
after many futile endeavors, succeedQdl at length in getting her feet&#xD;
against the frontage of the house; then she continued her descent,&#xD;
and finally reached the ground.&#xD;
She wandered along,, not knowing where she should lay her head.&#xD;
She was tired, very tired, for the reaction after her previous excite-&#xD;
me~. was so great that it almost prostrated her.&#xD;
On she went, until she came to the Haymarket; she walked up&#xD;
~ what is popularly known as the "quiet side."&#xD;
She was neither molested nor insulted, for the Haymarket of the&#xD;
present day is far different to what it was many years back.&#xD;
The "cafes" and fast houses 'were (to all appearances) closed.&#xD;
There were a few groups hanging about, bu~ they looked so miser-&#xD;
able in their tawdry finery, as shown in the cold gray morning, that&#xD;
it was with a shudder of sickening disgust that she passed by, for&#xD;
she thought of what she might have come to had but the designs of'&#xD;
Madame Rosini been successful.&#xD;
So she turned and walked slowly onwards~ At length she reached'&#xD;
the Duke of Yorlfs Column.&#xD;
Yes she would s1e~u in the park-she had heard that hundreds of&#xD;
the poor slept there each night. As hundreds do. Wretched&#xD;
creatures!&#xD;
She was poor, and our heroin~ turned into the park. The first,&#xD;
second, third arid aye, a dozen b~'nches were filled with what ap-&#xD;
peared to be bundles of rags, but the heavy breathing and shart,&#xD;
hacking coughs that burst from them at intervals, showed that&#xD;
human beings, people with souls, lay beneath-to the shame and&#xD;
disgraces of the~ richest country in the ~orld.&#xD;

At length our heroine found a seat upon which only one person&#xD;
was sleeping-it was a woman closely muffled up in a scanty shawl.&#xD;
Marian could not see her features, and without disturbing her, sat&#xD;
doWn.&#xD;
She soon dropped into a kii~d of stupor and had pleasant dreams&#xD;
of happiness and comfort-k~f. money and kind friends. So she&#xD;
went to sleep, but not to rest, 'with hopes almost as faint and com-&#xD;
fortless as the cold, gray morning light, that some lucky accident&#xD;
would happen to her on the coming day.&#xD;

CHAPTER Y~&#xD;
ASLEEP IN THE PARK.-5NATCHED FROM THE FLAMES~&#xD;
"What are you sleeping here for, eh?"&#xD;
These were the first words that our heroine heard, 'when she was&#xD;
~awoke by a rough hand upon her shoulder, and looking up she saw a&#xD;
policeman.&#xD;
"Come, get out of this, tramp," and so saying, the man put her&#xD;
on her feet, aud without a word, for s1~e had not strength to speak,&#xD;
~she walked away, and glancing back, she saw the industrious man in&#xD;
blue arousing her companion of the previous night-the man tore&#xD;
4he shawl from the woman's face, and awoke her.&#xD;
Our heroine stopped, she thought she had seen the f~itures be-&#xD;
'fore, and she hastened back to the seat.&#xD;
"What, Fanny," cried Marian, rushing back and taking the poor&#xD;
creature's hands,&#xD;
"Oh, Marian !"&#xD;
They were known to each other, and had, by a strange coinci-&#xD;
dence, been together for several hours, without the slightest idea of&#xD;
their~ proximity.&#xD;
In her fellow wanderer, Marian had recognized an old friend, one&#xD;
'of the girls who, decked out in muslin skirts and wreaths of flowers,&#xD;
had so often danced upon the same boards, and together had re-&#xD;
ceived the rapturous plaudits of a delighted audience.&#xD;
But what were they now?&#xD;
What had they both 'fallen to?&#xD;
"So you are knOwn to' each other. Ah! you're a nice pair of&#xD;
birds, I'll take my davey," said the policeman. "Now then move&#xD;
on, and look sharp, or I'll take you to the station."&#xD;
The girls "moved on," and as soon as they were some distance&#xD;
from that bright ornament to our civil force, they spoke.&#xD;
"F~nny how did you come to this?"&#xD;
The other laughed recklessly.&#xD;
"I was just going to ask you the same, dear, but if you'll listen,&#xD;
I'll tell you. When I left the theatre, I went to live with Fred&#xD;
Blake, the photographer, in St. Martin's Lane. Of course it was&#xD;
very xvrong and all that, but it was a deuced sight better than kick-&#xD;

&#xD;
(&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
ing up our heels in that blessed theatre for the money we got.&#xD;
Fred was very kind to me, I loved him very much, and we lived at&#xD;
a pretty stylish rate; at last we were so pressed for money that&#xD;
poor Fred went and forged another person's name for five hundred&#xD;
pounds; it was found out when it was presented at the bank. The&#xD;
poor fellow was arrested, and last month the beak gave him ten&#xD;
years' penal servitude, so i[ lost him, dear fellow."&#xD;
And the lost woman burst into tears. '&#xD;
"Oh! what a fool J am to go on snivelling. Well, old lady, since&#xD;
that time I have been gay. Now don't look shocked. What was I&#xD;
to do? I wasn't going to starve, and I couldn't get work at the&#xD;
theatres, because they were full for the season, and so, not having&#xD;
~ny money, I 'went Vo the bad.,' It's as good a life as any other."&#xD;
And again she laughed recklessly.&#xD;
"Qh! don't laugh like that, pray don't, Fanny."&#xD;
"Well, what's the odds? so long as you're happy. Now, old&#xD;
lady, come on for your tale."&#xD;
In a few words our heroine told Fanny Spencer what had befallen&#xD;
her, and in conclusion she said-&#xD;
"What am I to do?"&#xD;
"Do! in the first place have you any money?"&#xD;
"Yes," said our heroine; "but it is only a small sum."&#xD;
"How much?"&#xD;
"Five shillings and a few halfpence."&#xD;
"What! you really possess all that, and yet you slept in the&#xD;
park?" inquired Fanny, in astonishment.&#xD;
"Yes; what could I do? I was alone unprotected, and I knew not&#xD;
where to go for shelter."&#xD;
"Ah! I see, old lady, you'r4i not up to all the moves on the board&#xD;
~y~; come, I say, will you let me put you in the way of building the&#xD;
foundation of a home, upon the strength of the five bob which you&#xD;
"Yes, that I will-tell me-show me the way, and forever will I&#xD;
be grateful to you~"&#xD;
"Look here, Marian; II am sick and tired of my present life, I am&#xD;
not totally depraved or bad~ and if I had the chance of earning a&#xD;
respectable livelihood, I would only too willingly take advantage&#xD;
of it. You are a good hand at your needle, and I am not deficient&#xD;
in that branch of domestic employment; you also have sufficient&#xD;
money to procure a lodging for both. Let us seek for a room, and&#xD;
then endeavor to obtain xvork as dressmakers; our~ capital is cer-&#xD;
tainly not much to start upon, but by exercising the closest of&#xD;
economy, I think we might be able to pull through. So come along&#xD;
old lady."&#xD;
And with this, the two girls, with beaming countenances, at the&#xD;
hopes they had raised within themselves regarding' tbe&#xD;
prospects, walked towards the Strand. ir ffii '~y~&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
MARIAN IN DI5TRE55.-A FRIEND IN NEED.-GEORGE YILLIER5 TURNS UP.-&#xD;
-A HAPPY HOME. ~&#xD;
AFTER wandering about the best part of the day, the two girls at&#xD;
length engaged a small room in Houghton Street, Clare Market; for&#xD;
this they had to pay seven-and-sixpence per week, and~ half a-crown.&#xD;
of their limited means was at once paid away as a deposit, the re-&#xD;
mainder they laid out in various articles of food, which was absol-&#xD;
utely necessary.&#xD;
As the two girls lay down that night, they fejt happy, for they&#xD;
had done their best, and they had hopes of procuring immediate&#xD;
employment at needle-work.&#xD;
And so, with hopeful hearts, they arose early, and set forth upon&#xD;
their search, in spite of the rain, which was falliPg heavily. Sum-&#xD;
moning up their courage, they called at warehouse after warehouse,&#xD;
during that long wet day. only to return home the same evening~&#xD;
cold, chilly, tired and hopeless, and further away than ever from&#xD;
the remotest prospect of employment.&#xD;
But .the worst had not yet befallen them. Marian, with her thin&#xD;
boots, had caught cold on the previous clay, and when she encleav-&#xD;
ored to arise, she fell back upon the bed with a moan of angui~h.&#xD;
"It's no use, Fanny," she said, with a sigh, "I see but one chance.&#xD;
I am afraid I shall be very ill-and that chance I must try.~'&#xD;
"XYhat is that?"&#xD;
"You must go over to the Royal Victoria . Theatre, and tell Mr~&#xD;
Villiers, the aetor, how I am situated. God knows that I would&#xD;
not apply to him for aid could I but help it."&#xD;
Fanny burst into tears as she beheld the helplessness of her com&#xD;
panion.&#xD;
"Oh! my darling," she sobbingly said, "there seems to be always&#xD;
some obstacle when I want to be good and virtuous-when I want&#xD;
to renounce the terrible life that I have led, I am prevented. Oh&#xD;
why am I not dead?" she bitterly added..&#xD;
"Hush, oh! hush," cried Marian. "Put your trust in Heaven.&#xD;
We shall yet come out of our troubles."&#xD;
"Your words, dear Marian, give me fresh courage. It is foolish&#xD;
of me to repine, when you are lying ill, and all my energy and strength&#xD;
of mind is required. I will at once hasten to see Mr. Villiers, and&#xD;
will bring him back with me. Come, drink this cup of tea, and&#xD;
then try to sleep until I return."&#xD;
Marian did as her forlorn friend bade her, and Fanny, hastily&#xD;
attiring herse4, went on her mission. -&#xD;
About an hour aftei~wards, Marian was awakened, and found that&#xD;
Fanny had returned with the youyig actor, who gazed upon her com-&#xD;
passionately, and said "I am so sorry that you are ill, Miss Living-&#xD;
ston. And we are all so grieved at the manner in which Mr. Bowers&#xD;
has treated you. What can I do for you 'i"&#xD;
"I don't know how to ask you- but you seem the only friend I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
1&#xD;
It&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;amp;erets of a Young Girl.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
have in the world." stammered Marian, through her blushes and&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
"It's all ri~'ht," abruptly broke in Fanny. "I've told Mr. Villiers&#xD;
everything-all about you and I-and he's already procured me a&#xD;
situation in the ballet at the theatre, and is going to take you to a&#xD;
place where you'll be cared for until you are recovered."&#xD;
"Oh! Mr. Villiers, how can I-I-thank you?" began Marian.&#xD;
"Pshaw! no thanks are needed, my dear Miss Livingston. I&#xD;
should indeed be churlish were I to refuse to aid those who are&#xD;
helpless; besides, you must remember that we are old friends; and&#xD;
surely you do not forget the many pleasant chats we have had be-&#xD;
tween the wings at night, when we have been waiting to 'go on?"'&#xD;
"Oh, yes, yes," said Marian. "I can never forget you." I&#xD;
And then she stopped short, and blushed ~o sweetly, that V4lliers&#xD;
could have kissed her, albeit he was also much confused at her naive&#xD;
way of speaking.&#xD;
"Now, do not continue crying, I beg, Miss Livingston you know&#xD;
that your eyes are far too beautiful to spoil by weeping."&#xD;
Marian aroused herself at these flatteries.&#xD;
"Compliments are poor food for misery to feed on. Mr, Villiers,"&#xD;
she cried. "It is not manly to insult an unprotected girl,"-and at&#xD;
the thought of her isolated position, her tears flowed afresh.&#xD;
"Calm yourself," said Villiers. "I neither wish to insult or harm&#xD;
you. I will help you, if I can.~'&#xD;
"Alas! I am indeed in sore need of help," sobbed Marian.&#xD;
"T will give you shelter," said George Villiers. "Nay, do not be&#xD;
alarmed, my proposal is honorable. I will take you to my sister.&#xD;
)        Say you accept my offer,&#xD;
Marian made no reply; her head dropped gently on one side, and&#xD;
she fell back senseless, and Villiers gave a cry of alarm.&#xD;
"Don't be frightened." said Fanny. "The poor darling ha~ 6nly&#xD;
fainted. Go you and get a cab, while I bring her round, and get&#xD;
her dressed.~~&#xD;
The young actor left the room, and~when~ he returned, with the&#xD;
assistance of Fanny, they supported Marian down to the vehicle in&#xD;
waiting, and both bidding a temporary adieu to Fanny, the cab&#xD;
drove rapidly off.&#xD;
After a while the cab stopped before a house in a quiet and res-&#xD;
pectable-looking street, and George ~illiers executed a series of&#xD;
rapid knocks np~n the door, which was immediately opened by a&#xD;
smart-looking servant girl.&#xD;
"Is my sister within? " demanded&#xD;
"Yes, sir," was the reply.     George..&#xD;
"All right, little one," said Villiers to Marian; "you need have&#xD;
no fear--you are at home, and amongst friends."&#xD;
So saying, he threw open the parlor door, and ushered Marian&#xD;
into the room."&#xD;
A young lady who was reading, rose at their entrance, and gazed&#xD;
inquiringly at Villiers.&#xD;
"Dont be alarmed, Annie," said Villiers, smiling. "I've had an&#xD;
adventure, and the result of it is, I have brought you a sister home,"&#xD;

"Oh," cried Marian, "how good you are. I know that I can trust&#xD;
you. I will make you acquainted with my story, but ere I tell it,&#xD;
you must both promise t ~t neither of you will reveal it to any one&#xD;
until a fitting time comes,&#xD;
Having obtained the desired promise, Marian, with a voice broken&#xD;
by sobs, related to the compassionate brother all that sh~ knew of&#xD;
her hi~tory.&#xD;
When our heroine had concluded, Villiers said-&#xD;
"My dear Miss Livingston, you must leave this matter in my&#xD;
hands; as to waiting for a fitting time to arrive, that is out of the&#xD;
question. Come, say that you will leave it with me."&#xD;
"Yes. I will," unhesitatingly returned our heroine.&#xD;
"That is well. Now, then, my sister will see yot~ to your bed-&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
IN WHICH MARIAN OBTAINED AN ENGAGEMENT AT THE SLAP-UP SALOON,&#xD;
AND MAKES HER FIR5T APPEARANCE UPON A MU5IC ~1ALL STAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
A FEW days passed, and Marian h~ad sufficiently recovered to be&#xD;
able to seek an engagement, and with that idea she placed herself&#xD;
in the hands of a theatrical agent, who dwelt in a small court off&#xD;
Bow street, and who, though very ready and eage~ to take his fee&#xD;
of fiveshillings, was not so quick in procuring her thG engagement&#xD;
* 'ii&#xD;
or the salary she required.&#xD;
Marian at length determined not to apply for an engagement in.&#xD;
any of the '~corps de ballet" at the theatres.&#xD;
She intended to try her good fortune at one of the numerous&#xD;
music-halls with which London abouj~ds, and determined to i~ake&#xD;
the attempt at the Royal Slap-up Saloon, in Shoreditch, so hailing&#xD;
an omnibus she proceeded thither.&#xD;
The manager and sole proprietor of this saloon had risen from a&#xD;
potman, when he was known as Bill Byles, to his present position,&#xD;
and had assumed the high-sounding title of Perciv~4 de Clifford.&#xD;
From hi Marian got an answer in the negative, but several things&#xD;
combine uced him to alter his decision.&#xD;
It had been raining, and the pavements were very muddy, and to~&#xD;
avoid contamination, Marian raised her dress considerably on leav-&#xD;
ing the house, and by so doing she displayed a good deal of her&#xD;
well-turned ankles.&#xD;
Mr. de Clifford had a great admiration for pretty faces and was&#xD;
drawn to the window to see our heroine depart. He rang hi~ bell,&#xD;
and dispatched a messenger to bring the girl back.&#xD;
The result of her interview was an engagement to appear nightly&#xD;
as character dancer and occasional singer, at airly good salary.&#xD;
"You see," said de Clifford, when announ ~ the engagement of'&#xD;
the new ~'star" to his stage-manager and chairman, "you see, dear&#xD;
boy, legs is legs, and clerks and sich like loves to look at'em. Blow&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
talent, so as there's plenty of legs; it makes the men in the audi-&#xD;
ence feverish, and they drink more. Now this girl's not only got&#xD;
legs, but she's got a pretty face, and a fine bust a top on 'em; and II&#xD;
tell you what, dear boy, she's a regular clipper."&#xD;
The proprietor of the Slap-Up rubbed his hands with delight,&#xD;
while the young lady dancer, who had hitherto been the principal..&#xD;
attraction to the frequenters of the saloon, could hardly keep her&#xD;
paint on so excessively warm did she become in abusing the bold-&#xD;
faced upstai't who was about to rob her of her prized laurels.&#xD;
Behind the scenes she met with a rather cool reception, she was&#xD;
looked upon as an interloper, and the young lady before mentioned&#xD;
addressed her in words and tones that were intended to be cutting~&#xD;
a~d sarcastic, but to Marian they only appeared as slightly defective&#xD;
in grammar.&#xD;
Fron~ the audience our heroine met with a most flattering&#xD;
reception,&#xD;
They were not all critics, and did not notice that she was occa-&#xD;
sionally out of tune; if they did they did not care for it; the ap-&#xD;
plause was unanimous and the management was perfectly justified&#xD;
in announcing that Mademoiselle Livingston had proved a most&#xD;
unprecedented success.&#xD;
Thus it was that she commenced a new and prosperous career,&#xD;
which however, she afterwards found was not exactly a bed of roses&#xD;
for she had so many people to please.&#xD;
First came Mr. de Clifford-but she managed in a perfectly&#xD;
excusable way to start a lively flirtation with him, and was always&#xD;
careful to keep that ai~uorous gentleman at a respectful distance.&#xD;
for he possessed the unenviable reputation of making love to all the&#xD;
ladies engaged at his establishment, and if they did not listen to his.&#xD;
overtures, lie discharged them instanter.&#xD;
Next came the British Public -the many headed dragon that no&#xD;
artist dare offend. These, in Marion's case were represented by the&#xD;
unwashed ladies and gentlemen who could afford the necessary sum&#xD;
of threepence to pay for their admission into the interior of the~&#xD;
Royal Slap-Up.&#xD;
These she got on with capitally, for she speedily discovered that&#xD;
whatever or however she sang, provided always that her petticoats&#xD;
were short enough, a~nd h~r attitudes sufficiently striking, she was&#xD;
'~ sure to be rapturously applauded.&#xD;
With the gentlemen, in short, Marian was the favorite, but the&#xD;
ladies were either more difficult to please, or had different tastes to&#xD;
the lords of the creation, or perhaps they were jealous; but be the&#xD;
case as it mig~h~t, it was pretty certain that Marian got liberally&#xD;
abused by those of her own sex.&#xD;
Brazen-faced and bold were the mildest adjectives tack~I upon&#xD;
her name.&#xD;
Improper, loose, and depraved, were the epithets showered upon&#xD;
her by the better halves of the worthy pa~vnbrok~rs and publicans&#xD;
situated near the music-hall,&#xD;
Indeed these indignant ladies boldly declared their belief that&#xD;
Marian's special mission at the Slap-Up Saloon was to temi~t the&#xD;

her benefit, and fully succeeded in working up the audience to a&#xD;
high state of excitement.&#xD;
She was attirecd in a somewhat mysterious dress, vaguely believed&#xD;
in by the theatrical people as a correct costume of Troubadors of&#xD;
the fourteenth century, and she appeared to perfection in her tight-&#xD;
fitting costunie.&#xD;
She came forward and sang a song (which, by the bye, had noth-&#xD;
ing whatever to do with the troubadors) which was encored,&#xD;
She sang another and that was rapturously encored, 'then she&#xD;
varied the performance with a dance, and if the song was rapturous&#xD;
ly encored, goodness, knows what adjectives will. apply to the&#xD;
dance.&#xD;
The audience seemed to think they could stay there all night to&#xD;
see her stand on the tips of her toes, with one leg out at right&#xD;
angles like a maniacal teetotum, and they never stopped to inquire&#xD;
whether it was in keeping with the character she represented.&#xD;
But Marian got tired of this sort of- amusement sooner than the&#xD;
audience, so, after having been called six or seven times in succes-&#xD;
sion, she refused to appear any more, and the threepenny paying&#xD;
public had to content themselves with the "Virginian Minstrels,"&#xD;
and a choice selection of negro melodies.&#xD;
Whien Marian left the stage, a letter was thrust into her hand by&#xD;
Mr. de"Clifford.&#xD;
" Dear me, Miss Livingston," said he, "I am afraid something&#xD;
has happened to Mr, Villiers-a carriage is waiting for you."&#xD;
Darting a frightened look at the manager, Marian hastily tore&#xD;
open the note, and read the following lines: -&#xD;
Royal Victoria Theatre.&#xD;
DEAR MARIAN,--&#xD;
My poor brother has had an accident at the&#xD;
Victoria Theatre; some heavy scenery has fallen upon him. Come&#xD;
at once to the assistance of&#xD;
Your's Lovingly,&#xD;
ANNIE.&#xD;
P. S,-The carriage of the doctor who is attendiing him will con-&#xD;
vey you hither.&#xD;
Marian dashed past Mr. de Clifford,-and, hastening to the dress-&#xD;
lug-room, she rapidly changed her dress. Outside the stage-door&#xD;
she found a man waiting for her.&#xD;
The man assumed an expression of the deepest sympathy as she&#xD;
approached.&#xD;
He was a respectable looking person of middle age, neat in his&#xD;
attire; in fact, what/physician's servant might be supposed to be;&#xD;
yet, with all this, there was something in his silent movements&#xD;
calculated to raise mistrust in the mind of an observant individual.&#xD;
-,"I am ready to go with you at once," said the excited girl. "Oh&#xD;
pray let us hurry."&#xD;
*Had she been calmer, she must have wondered at the style of the&#xD;
&#xD;
THEsE were the words, printedl in letters containing all the colors&#xD;
of the rainbow- and many more that don't appear there at all-at&#xD;
least a yard in height, on posters, stuck up on all the dead-walls and&#xD;
available spaces round tlho Royal Slap-up Saloon.&#xD;
It was a fact. Marian had been so successsful, and had put so&#xD;
much money into the coffers of Mr. de Clifford, that that gentleman&#xD;
one day, in the heat of, the moment, and assisted by one or two&#xD;
extra glasses of hot gin and water actually proposed that she should&#xD;
have a benefit night, a thing undreamt of by her ,predecessors; .as&#xD;
the sagacious reader may suppose, Marian was not behind in accept-&#xD;
ing the offer.&#xD;
On the night of her benefit the magnificent orchestra -of th~e&#xD;
"Royal Slap-up Saloon " played a choice selection of operatic airs,&#xD;
so tortured and altered that it would puzzle the composer himself to&#xD;
say whether he was the author or not.&#xD;
At length the overture is concluded, and lightly tripping down&#xD;
the stage comes the fair Marian, gracefuly acknowledging the some-&#xD;
what noisy greeting she receives from the audience.&#xD;
Our heroine had a new dress and a new song for the occasion of&#xD;

carriage waiting to receive her, which bore little resemblance to the&#xD;
kind of vehicle usually employed by medical men; and she als@&#xD;
would have remarked the presence of a man enveloped in a' loose'&#xD;
over-coat, who sat in the rumble of the carriage, smoking a ~igar.&#xD;
But as it was Marian saw nothing; th~ carriage-door was opened&#xD;
foil her, and she sprang into it, and sank, half fainting, upon the'&#xD;
seat.&#xD;
"Pray beg the coachman to drive quickly," she cried, in an im-&#xD;
ploring voice, as the man closed the door.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, miss. we'll drive fast enough," he answered, with a&#xD;
sinister grin, as he ascended the box, and the horses started off.&#xD;
The man wrapped in the over-coat, and seated in the rumble, was&#xD;
the same nobleman, who, under the name of Cousin Smith, had&#xD;
persecuted Marian at Madame Rosini s in Soho Square.&#xD;
One or two gentlemen were laughing at the corner of the street,&#xD;
and watched the departing vehicle.&#xD;
"By Jove! the Marquis has won the wager," said one of the&#xD;
party.&#xD;
"Yes! and lids bird is helpless now," said another of the gentle-&#xD;
men, with a significant smile. "But, messieurs, let us to a more&#xD;
lively part of the town,"&#xD;
The carriage in which Marian was seated, drove at a rapid pace,&#xD;
but to the yoting girl's dismay an ~ terror, it was not going in the&#xD;
direction of the Yictoria Theatre.&#xD;
She was 'in an agony of excitemejit, thinking that the coachman,.&#xD;
through mere ignorance or stupidity, had taken the wrong way,&#xD;
and that time, precious time, would be lost.&#xD;
Ii            She pulled the check-string violently, but the driver took no&#xD;
notice, only he ~seemed to drive' faster every minute.&#xD;
Rendered desperate by her fears, Marian would have endeavored&#xD;
to have sprung from the carriage, at the ri~k of her 'life, but she&#xD;
found when she tried the door of the carriage that it was locked;:&#xD;
she then beat desperately, with her hands, against the front windows&#xD;
of the carriage; the coachman must have heard her, but he did not--&#xD;
even turn round, and took no notice 'of her frantic summons.&#xD;
Marian strained her eyes endeavoring to discern' where she ~was,.&#xD;
but the neighborhood seemed entirely strange to her,. and a feeling&#xD;
of despair caine over her.&#xD;
By-and-bye, the houses grew more scattered, there were trees,.&#xD;
and a country road.&#xD;
A road which seemed to be interminable to the distracted girl,&#xD;
who watched it from the open window; she felt she was the victim&#xD;
of some conspiracy, but she did not for a moment doubt the story&#xD;
of Yilliers' accident.&#xD;
hour's ~pid travelling, the carriage pulled up before an&#xD;
fashioned inn.&#xD;
It seemed as though the travellers were expected, for though it&#xD;
was past midnight, a man came eut of the stables directly the&#xD;
vehicle stopped.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
MARIAN CONTINUES HER STRANGE' JOURNEY.-A STARTLING RECOGNITiON-&#xD;
BLACK IVIE5.&#xD;
THE lights were all out, and the inmates had evidently retired to&#xD;
rest long before, but the stable yard was open, and a light in one&#xD;
of the sheds within.&#xD;
No time was lost in waiting for, while an os~tler- removed the&#xD;
jaded and steaming~ animals from the carriage, a second man came&#xD;
out of the stable yard leading a pair of fresh horses.&#xD;
Marian thrust her, head out o~ie window, and saw a tall slen-&#xD;
derly built man, standing a little ~ from the carriage.&#xD;
"Oh! sir," she cried, "as you hope for the mercy of heaven, tell&#xD;
me the Ine~ning of tl,~is mys-tery."&#xD;
The Marquis, thus addressed, approached the carriage window:&#xD;
his face was shaded by the brim of his hat, which he. wore low on&#xD;
his forehead, and by a Cashmere shawl which enveloped his chin.&#xD;
The night was dark, though fine, and Marian could not recognize&#xD;
her profligate l)ersecutor.&#xD;
"My angel," ~nsw~red the Marquis, in a light, laughing tone,&#xD;
"pray don't give way to that silly grief, and spoil your deuced&#xD;
beautiful eyes; your mind may be perfectly at rest with regard to&#xD;
Mr. Villiers' accident: it is only a fiction, and as far as I know, he is&#xD;
as well as ever."&#xD;
"He is not ill? B'ut the letter from his sister Annie?"&#xD;
"That letter was only part of an innocent stratagem, which Ii am&#xD;
sure you will pardon when you know its motives, my dear."&#xD;
The fresh horses were harnessed by this time, and the driver was&#xD;
in his seat before Marian &amp;amp;ould ask another question.&#xD;
At last about two o'clock in the moi:ning, the carriage stopped be-&#xD;
fore a dreary building, with a castellated roof and circular towers&#xD;
at each end of the wall.&#xD;
In the past it might have been taken for th~ feudal castle of some&#xD;
lawless, marauding baron, but, in the present day, it looked more&#xD;
like a madhouse or a gaol.&#xD;
.The Marquis came to the carriage door and assisted Marian to&#xD;
alight. The poor suffering girl was utterly worn out, both in mind&#xD;
and body, by the events of the night.&#xD;
Marian alighted from the vehicle with a tottering step, and must&#xD;
have fallen to the ground had not the Marquis supported her~&#xD;
"Oh! wh~'e am I," she gasped. "Why am I brought here?"&#xD;
"Have patience, dearest and loveliest of girls, and you shall know&#xD;
all; ask no questions now," answered his lordship, in a tended~&#xD;
whisper.&#xD;
A stifled cry burst from Marian's lips- there was something in&#xD;
the speaker's words thai chilled her to the heart.&#xD;
It was the tone of a \~umphant lover-who believed that his&#xD;
victim was in his power.&#xD;
Inexperienced as Marian was of life's perils, her instinct seemed&#xD;
to reveal to her the danger and misery of her helpless position.&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
THE BURGLARs.--A sTARTLING SURPRISE.&#xD;
3        IT was night. The clock, in the tower',of the parish church had&#xD;
tolled forth the hour of twelve, and ,all th~e inhabitants of Rainham&#xD;
near which village Black Ivies was situated, were wrapped in deep&#xD;
repose, and unconscious of existing things:&#xD;
As the clock chimed the quarter. the noise' of wheels might have&#xD;
been heard rapidly approaching, and a light dog cart, containing six&#xD;
men swiftly approached, the village.&#xD;
The cart stopped before a door that opened from the kitchen into&#xD;
the 'yard, and one of the men drew from a bag a centre-bit, as' used&#xD;
&#xD;
But gentle though she was, she had the proud and noble spirit of&#xD;
a true woman, the spirit that boldly asserts itself in the hour of&#xD;
danger and difficulty.&#xD;
"Why am I brought here?" she -demanded almost fiercely draw-~&#xD;
ing away from the Marquis' supporting arm,. " Who are you that&#xD;
have been base enough to betray and lure me away from my home&#xD;
under such cruel pretences? My helplessness should have rendered&#xD;
me sacred."&#xD;
"My dearest angel," returned the Marquis, paying bul little atten-&#xD;
tion to the impassioned speech, "do not be such a prude. Did you&#xD;
but know the absorbing love-the devoted admiration that. I have&#xD;
for you-I am sure you would pardon all. However, you must let&#xD;
me defer all unpleasant explanations until to--morrow.&#xD;
Marian was almost fainting, and she was too weak ito make any&#xD;
further struggle to extricate herself from the power of her persecu-&#xD;
tor ; she sank upon a bench in the entrance hall, which was dimly&#xD;
lighted by one lamp.                              .:&#xD;
A blear--eyed, wicked--looking woman, had admitted his lordship&#xD;
and his trembling companion into the hall, when the Marquis com--&#xD;
mitted Marian to the old'creature's charge-.&#xD;
"You received my letter?" he asked.&#xD;
"Am I better," mumbled the crone,  ,, No, your lordship, I'm&#xD;
rather hard o' hearing still."&#xD;
"Did you get my letter," shouted the Marquisp his eyes figshimg&#xD;
with anger-.&#xD;
"Yes, yes, I got the letter," said the hag, dimly understanding&#xD;
what was wanted of her, "and all is ready for the young lady. The&#xD;
blue chamber makes a nice birdcage. But she's a bonny bride-a&#xD;
bonny bride."&#xD;
The old woman led her charge up the broad oaken staircase, and&#xD;
ushered her into a room at the end of a long corridor-.&#xD;
Marian had scarcely strength to totter to a large, four post, old&#xD;
fashioned bedstead, that looked like a hearse-.&#xD;
Upon this the luckless girl sank helplessly and hopelessly.&#xD;
&#xD;
by carpenters, and made two holes in the door, one above each bolt.&#xD;
A thin, sharp, well-oiled saw was, then introduced, and cut two-&#xD;
circular holes, through which the burglar introduced his hand, and&#xD;
noiselessly and cautiously drew back the bolts,&#xD;
Then lifting the catch, he opened the door, and the whole party&#xD;
enter.&#xD;
"-G t the bag," he whispered, "and slip these things in it ; it is&#xD;
splendilI booty, and well worth the trouble it has cost us."&#xD;
So s ying, and without nose, he very rapidly turned out of the&#xD;
box a valuable service of plate.&#xD;
They carefully stowed in the bag that held their tools, the silver&#xD;
service, and a variety of smaller articles, then all silently left the&#xD;
room, closing the door behind them.&#xD;
Not content with the amount of their plunder, they determined&#xD;
to visit some of the other apartments, and they piroceedled to another&#xD;
room, the door of which they found strongly bolted. Cautiously&#xD;
they proceeded to undo the fastenings, and opening the door, our&#xD;
heroine was discovered asleep.&#xD;
On entering, the man stumbled, and fell with a curse!&#xD;
This was sufficient to arouse the sleeper, who seeing four men in&#xD;
her room, with a scream for aid, leaped from her bed, and rushed&#xD;
franticall,y to the bell-pull.&#xD;
Seeing her intentions, the burglar stepped forward,. and caught&#xD;
-her loosely -clad fornr in his arms, and placed one hand over her&#xD;
month to prevent her raising an alarm.&#xD;
In a moment her head fell gently on one side, and with a smothered&#xD;
sigh she slipped 'from his arms and fell senseless upon the floor of&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
The burglar then turned the light of the lantern upon the face of&#xD;
the helpless girl.&#xD;
With a curse he recognized her.&#xD;
It was his reputed granddaughter, Marian Livingston!&#xD;
Like a-flash of lightning his fertile brain formed a daring plan,&#xD;
" The girl is here," he thought. "How she came here I neither&#xD;
know or care. But if she has any influential friends, it will be&#xD;
dangerous to let her remain here, for she might make awkward&#xD;
disclosures respecting me. .Whereas, if I could keep her in con-&#xD;
finement until this hubbub has blown over, I might manage to cut&#xD;
off to America, and she could go to the devil. The boozing ken in&#xD;
Pie Street abounds in old, cellars. Once get her there, I should&#xD;
have her quite safely under my eye."&#xD;
Then turning to his comrades, who were ransacking the cupboards,&#xD;
he made them acquainted with his plan.&#xD;
S"IHow will you manage to convey the girl up to London without&#xD;
detection?" inquired one of the men.&#xD;
." Leave it all to me, it shall be done without risk to any of us."&#xD;
'After some hesitation, the others consented ; and then, by the&#xD;
direction of Ralph, wrapped a blanket round the senseless girl.&#xD;
,whom Ralph raised in his arms, and carried to the cart as if she had&#xD;
'been a child, while the others followed, bearing the girls clothes and&#xD;
-the bag of plunder. They got into the cart, and the vehicle was&#xD;
driven back to the village as the clocks were chiming.&#xD;

A LAMB GTJABDED BY woLvEs.- A STRATAGEM, AND EXPLANATION OF&#xD;
J                         WHAT 15 SEEMINGLY IMPI~OBABLE.&#xD;
WHEN our heroine returned to consciousness, she found herself&#xD;
'dressed, and seated in a cab by the side of her captors.&#xD;
"Where am I? Where are you taking me to?" cried Marian, in&#xD;
great alarm, trying to rise, but immediately falling helpless upon the&#xD;
seat when she found that her ankles had been tied together, and her&#xD;
-arms securely fastened to her sides.&#xD;
j           "You are in London, my dear; and we are conveying you to your&#xD;
the other men joined, evidently thinking that their leader had saidfuture residence," replied Ralph, with a sneering laugh, in which&#xD;
good thing.&#xD;
The strange position in which our her me fo d herself, together&#xD;
with the sinister' looks of her rufilanl companions, their audacity in&#xD;
carrying her off so very ope y, in e"~broad dayli~t, through the&#xD;
crowded streets of busy on, and a keen sense of her own help-&#xD;
lessness, paralysed her ith horror.&#xD;
The cab was proceeding at a rapid pace over Westminster&#xD;
* Bridge, and iVilarian, making a strong effort, endeavored to shake&#xD;
'off the k~thargy and the terror which she now experienced, and&#xD;
which almost overpowered her, and, giving fAll vent to her lungs,&#xD;
uttered piercing screams for aid.&#xD;
The cab drove the faster.&#xD;
V            A second scream, more wild and piercing 'than the first.&#xD;
The two men laughed, rolled, looked stupid, hiccuped, fell into&#xD;
V 'each other's arms, cried, and ac~d every other prank of the drunk-&#xD;
ard. '&#xD;
The men on the box remained as they were, only driving the faster&#xD;
and apparently paying no attention to the farce being so well played&#xD;
inside the vehicle.&#xD;
Marian, alarmed beyond measure, screamed louder than ever.&#xD;
A foot-passenger and a policeman, hearing our heroine, and&#xD;
having a vague suspicion that something was wrong, 'stopped the&#xD;
cab before Westminster Abbey, and, as is usual in London, a crowd&#xD;
of the curious soon collected.&#xD;
"Hallo, cabby, said the foot-passeenger, what sort of a fare have&#xD;
you got."&#xD;
He was followed up by the policeman, in a bullying tone.&#xD;
"You may well ask that, gentlemen," said the driver, touching his&#xD;
hat in mock humility. "Why, yer see, this yer party's been out all&#xD;
night, a having a bit of a spree, and they ain't quite recovered yet.'&#xD;
I Wish I was rid of them, I (loes."&#xD;
"Yes, but what makes the woman scream so ? " inquired the&#xD;
policeman.&#xD;
"That's my wife, your honor," readily replied the youngest of the&#xD;
' two men, with a decided Riberuiau accent; and the colleen thinks&#xD;
that I have bolted from her, so she's yelling after me. Them that's&#xD;
with her is her brothers, but, ~hum e they have been having a drop of&#xD;
I' -&#xD;

vi.'&#xD;
It&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
the craythur and by the powers of Ballyshannon, they're as tight as&#xD;
drums."&#xD;
"Nice lot, ain't they, gentlemen?" said the pretended cabman, as&#xD;
lie drove on, while the sympathising passenger passed on his way&#xD;
with a shrug and a shudder.&#xD;
The cab turned down Smith Street, and passed through several,&#xD;
dirty and seemingly deserted thoroughfares, for the majority of the&#xD;
people living in these miserable habitations being like owls, only&#xD;
make their appearance at night, and at length the party arrived at&#xD;
their destination, "Thieves' Kitchen," in Pye Street.&#xD;
Poor Marian~ who was~ almost speechless from fright and the&#xD;
effort of her unavailing screams, was hastily lifted from the cab by&#xD;
Ralph Dearwood into the passage of the house.&#xD;
When Marian recovered her senses, she found herself lying upon&#xD;
a lump of dirty straw, in a dark, damp cellar; a lamp was left burn-&#xD;
ing upon a shelf casting a faint light over the wretched place~~2~the&#xD;
loathsome hovel.&#xD;
Where was she?&#xD;
No answer to the momentous question that she continued asking&#xD;
herself.&#xD;
Grim silence reigned-so deadlythat it appalled the imaginatiofi,&#xD;
and would hav~e terrified the stoutest nerve.&#xD;
Marian clasped her hands over her burning brow, and tried .~&#xD;
collect her scattered thoughts.&#xD;
She remembered now-the man entering her room-the treacher-&#xD;
ous handkerchief-the passage in the cab going across Westminster&#xD;
Bridge-and her swoon when she alighted in Pye Street.&#xD;
She made an attempt t6 rise, but nature was too exhausted; she&#xD;
fell back upon the straw, and dropped into a heavy fitful sleep,&#xD;
broken only by dismal, horrible dreams.&#xD;
A key was inserted into the rusty lock of the grated oaken door,&#xD;
which was thrown open, and a man entered.&#xD;
The lamp had almost expired, so that Marian- could not see the&#xD;
face of the person whom instinct told her was her gaoler.&#xD;
"Are you a~yake?" demanded the man, abruptly, and in coarse&#xD;
tones.&#xD;
"Yes," said our heroine, faintly fancying she recognized the voice&#xD;
of the visitor.&#xD;
"Who are you? What do you want?" she timidly asked.&#xD;
"As to what I want, a few words will inform you; and as to who&#xD;
I am, look."&#xD;
So saying the man turned up the lamp,, and revealed the features&#xD;
of the villian, Ralph!&#xD;
"Ralph! " ~riec1 our heroine.&#xD;
"At your service," he replied with a sneer. "Now, my dainty&#xD;
bird, what J want is to keep you caged up for a short time."&#xD;
"And am I to remain here?" asked l~'~ Marian, who was almost&#xD;

Ralph nodded.&#xD;
"For how long?&#xD;

THREATENED WITH A HORRIBLE FATE,---TIIE RIVER.&#xD;
TWICE a day, in the morning and eVenino' R        arwood&#xD;
brought Marian her food, consisting of the commonest and coarsest&#xD;
description. At first her stomach revolted at such fare, but hunger&#xD;
overcame any prejudices she might fiave 4eht.&#xD;
no occasion did Ralph ever speak to her, though her prayers&#xD;
havee~~treaties to know the term of her unjust imprisonment might&#xD;
moved a heart of stone.&#xD;
How long she had been confined she did not exactly know, but.&#xD;
sh~ thought fully a fortnight must have elapsed since she was taken&#xD;
from Black Ivies.&#xD;
'I '           "What would Vilhiers think, in what light would he view her&#xD;
~,pdden disappearance (surrounded as it was by such very suspicious&#xD;
~rcumstances)? would he think that she was really depraved and&#xD;
abandoned? "that she had again thrown herself upon* the world,'~&#xD;
V            and was pursuing a low, sinful career of miscalled pleasure? would&#xD;
he cast her image from his heart and replace it with another?&#xD;
No! the thought was madness, death to our brave heroine; her&#xD;
heart yearned towards him, she must fly to Villiers, and explain.&#xD;
away all doubts,. and prove herself pure, still good and true.&#xD;
But how to fly, how to escape from her accursed prison; and once&#xD;
more breathe with liberty, beneath the bright canopy of heaven-&#xD;
that was the dark question' she now asked herself.&#xD;
Poor Marian turned many plans over in her bewildered brain, but&#xD;
in all there occurred some insurmountal&amp;amp;4e obstaSle-some impossible&#xD;
obstruction to overcome-to her succe&#xD;
At last capricious Dame Fortune smiled on our sad heroine, and&#xD;
dispelled the dark clouds that gathered round her.&#xD;
The cellar was extremely damp, and in many cases the brick-work&#xD;
had fallen away.&#xD;
Theholes thus caused had been filled up with stout boarding&#xD;
roughly nailed to the wall.&#xD;
This was more especially the case with ~he part opposite the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
To this place the attention of our heroine had frequently been&#xD;
a'.&#xD;

ASecrels of a Young (bri..                 35&#xD;
&#xD;
called, as at times she 'could distinguish the sound of running water&#xD;
apparently proceeding from the back, and a wild, adventurous&#xD;
scheme of immediate escape developed itself to her disturbed mind.&#xD;
Could she but break through the dilapidated barrier, she had a&#xD;
vague notion that she would find herscUf in a branch of the ~exver5&#xD;
-those gigantic arteries that convey away all the impurities of our&#xD;
mighty metropolis into the dirty bosom of Father Thames, anti&#xD;
Marian knew that if she could but follow the narrow stream, sooner&#xD;
or later she would come to some outlet for her escape.&#xD;
She was aware pf the peril she must encounter upon her da~nger-&#xD;
ous road-that of suffocating bp the noxious gases with which the&#xD;
sewers aboun ci, or perhaps death by drowning~ should the river be&#xD;
at the high tide.&#xD;
But the brave, high-spirited girl determined to risk all, for death~&#xD;
was preferable in any shape to this long' solitary imprisonment,.&#xD;
which she felt was slowly but surely stealing ,away her bright&#xD;
senses.&#xD;
One evening after her appointed gaoler had just brought in&#xD;
the miserable meal, replenished the lamp with fresh oil, and1 had&#xD;
departed without a word, our heroine commenced to put her plan of&#xD;
escape into execution.&#xD;
With ready ingenuity sht~ tore open the lining of her dress, anti&#xD;
took from her corset a piece of steel that is commonly sewh in the&#xD;
V       front of that habiliment, to support the bust.&#xD;
With this frail instrument she proceeckcl to pick away th~e cement&#xD;
that bound the bricks almost indissolubly together.&#xD;
it At last, with a sigh of joy, she loosened the first brick, and threw&#xD;
on the floor, then another, a third, and so on ufitil she had made&#xD;
a hole in the wall about a foot square.&#xD;
In another two hours the courageous girl had pulled down some&#xD;
of the boai'ding~, making sufficient space to creep through.&#xD;
Her pretty, white, delicate hands, [were scratched and bleeding~&#xD;
She tore her handkerchief in strips anti bound them up, then tak-.&#xD;
ing the lamp in her hand, she proceeded on her adventurous way,&#xD;
trusting to Heaven for protection anti delivery from her troubles.&#xD;
By the light of the lamp oiw heroine saw upon the wall, in the&#xD;
water upon every sidle of her, a host of moving' black animals.&#xD;
They were rats!&#xD;
The fiery red eyes of these vermin seemed to gaze with astonish-&#xD;
ment at the intruder into their subterranean territory, but the light&#xD;
prevei~teti them from assailing 'her, anti they fled in dismay.&#xD;
Oinvards, still onwTards, our heroine trampled on through the dis-&#xD;
mal sewer; at length, thoroughly fatigued. she stopped, auth placing&#xD;
the lamp 'beside her, sat clown upon a stone that happened to be&#xD;
v        placed against the wall.&#xD;
Exhausted nature must be restored, and, strange as it may seem&#xD;
Marian was soon overcome by deep sleep.&#xD;
Wheii she awoke next morning it was to a new horror; by the&#xD;
pale dim light of dawn struggling down from a grating ~far above&#xD;
heir reach, she saw her protecting friendly lamp had expired.&#xD;
But this was not all.&#xD;
Dozens and dozens of rats surroundecf her, nearer and nearer the&#xD;

~creatures approached, until one, more venturesome than the rest,&#xD;
leaped upon her lap, and was speedily followed by others~&#xD;
Marian arose with a piercing scream of hopeless agony, and shook&#xD;
Them off.&#xD;
The truth struck her at once.&#xD;
She was attacked by rats!&#xD;
Fortunately several pieces of wood were lying ijear, and seizing a&#xD;
piece, the poor girl defended herself as best she could. But for this&#xD;
lucky chance our heroine must have fallen an easy prey to these&#xD;
ferocious animals; as it was, it was as much as she could do to keep&#xD;
them at bay.&#xD;
The morning wa~ far advanced before she was entirely free from&#xD;
her assailants.&#xD;
When at last she had driven them off, the frightened girl dis&#xD;
covered that she had received several bites during the contest, but&#xD;
of these, though they smarted intolerably, she took no notice, for&#xD;
she was too grateful tQ that Omnipotent Being in whom she put her&#xD;
whole trust for her deliverance and protection.&#xD;
Still it seemed to her tortured mind that she was reserved for an-&#xD;
4other equally horrible death-Starvation!&#xD;
Poor girl! she began almost to despair of ever quitting the&#xD;
'cellars alive.&#xD;
With sinking' heart and depressed spirits, she agaii~ proceeded on&#xD;
her road.&#xD;
With nothing' but impenetrable darkness before her, splaslnng and&#xD;
walking through the mire, from which a dreadful, overpowering&#xD;
~smell arose.&#xD;
By andbye. with aii exclamation of h~artfelf joy, she halted.&#xD;
A gleam of bright heavenly sunshine caine from a grating far&#xD;
above her h~ad; she was evidently under a large and populous&#xD;
thoroughfare, for the noise of wheels unceasingly rolling sent a&#xD;
thousand echoes rumbling through' her vaulted noisome prison.&#xD;
In vain she screamed for aid.&#xD;
Her voice was lost in the distance, and never reached the street&#xD;
above.&#xD;
The busy, ceaseless din and whirl above her, drowned her cries.&#xD;
While intently listening, in the vain hope of hearing ~oine res-&#xD;
'ponse to her unavailing cries, she heard a noise. evidently at some&#xD;
~distance behind her.&#xD;
It sounded like the regular beat of the piston of a steam-engine.&#xD;
Marian, in horror of some fresh peril, was wondering from what&#xD;
cause it could proceed, when a stream of water came flowing swiftly&#xD;
along the sewer, carrying with it much of the lighter refuse lying&#xD;
about.&#xD;
"Great heavens!" cried she, in her horror and despair, "they&#xD;
are flushing the sewer!"&#xD;
Such indeed was the case, there having been a scarcity of rain for&#xD;
some weeks previous.&#xD;
The volume of water increasing every moment as it flowed oi to&#xD;
the river, showed Marian that shortly its force would be stronger&#xD;
Than she would be able to stand against.&#xD;

&#xD;
It increased rapidly, and our heroine was thrown d6wn, and&#xD;
carried with immense rapidity along with the stream.&#xD;
In vain the poor girl made frantic and almost' superhuman efforts&#xD;
to catch hold of the rough walls, but they seemed to glide from her&#xD;
grasp.&#xD;
She gave herself up for lost! Providence, however, decreed that&#xD;
she should not perish in this way.&#xD;
Throwing up her arms despairingly, in futile attempts to keep her&#xD;
her head above water, which each moment got higher and higher,&#xD;
her liand~ caine in contact, with a large plank, that was being borne&#xD;
along with the resistles~ torrent.&#xD;
This she caught hold of, and by great exertion, managed to sup-&#xD;
port herself.&#xD;
With only this' plank between her and death, she struggled for&#xD;
dear life upon the bosom of the angry flood.&#xD;
'Would she never reach the river?&#xD;
Each moment seemed a century of agony and hopeless suspense.&#xD;
Yes, at List ~he sees a light faintly glimmering in the distance&#xD;
it was so small that it seemed like a star, but, as she rapidly ap-&#xD;
proaches, it assumes larger dimensions. Heaven be praised! it is&#xD;
the opening of the river, and Marian can hazily distinguish the out-&#xD;
lines ofthe houses upon ~he opposite side of the river.&#xD;
With a rush, the seething, hissing waters fall into the Thames.&#xD;
along' with them. wet through, and half blinded by the sudden&#xD;
transition from darkness to light, comes the shiveriiig form of our&#xD;
unfortunate heroine, holding on to 'the plaiik with that tight des-&#xD;
pairing' grasp that persons can only-do when in the last extremity.&#xD;
A horrible death seemed inevitable to the wretched girl.&#xD;
The force with, which the waters dashed into the river, carried&#xD;
Marian into tli~ middle of the dreadful stream&#xD;
"Ahoy! ahoy! ahoy! Look! a woman in the water! The bows&#xD;
of the barge will run her down&#xD;
"No, nothing can save her, mate. Poor soul !-a suicide, I&#xD;
shoulcin' t wonder.&#xD;
These words passed between the two men aboard of a barge laden&#xD;
with coiil, that was coming' clown the river under heavy sail.&#xD;
Poor aifrighted Marian was right beneath the bows of the vessel,&#xD;
she recognized her clang'er, but escape was hopeless.&#xD;
The men who had spoken saw it also, but they were powerless to&#xD;
avert the catastrophe. The huge. unwieldy boat struck the plank&#xD;
from the grasp of the girl, who, with a heart-rending scream, sank&#xD;
beneath the i'ipphing' waves, into the cold, mysterious depths of the&#xD;
filthy and impure river.&#xD;

wood George Villiers, in consequence of a change in the programme&#xD;
at the Victoria Th&amp;amp;atre, was free for the evening, and he hastened&#xD;
over to Shoreditch, with the intention of accompanying Marian&#xD;
home; but, of course, upon seeing Mr. de Clifford, With whom he&#xD;
was personally acquainted, that gentleman informed him of the&#xD;
message which our heroine had received;&#xD;
"Great Heavens !" cried Villiers, "there is some base treachery&#xD;
at work; unfortunate girl, is she for ever to be persecuted!"&#xD;
The manager gazed at the actor with some surprise.&#xD;
"Well, I don't know about persecution; but if what my stage&#xD;
door keeper tells me is trueJ think it looks like a planned job,"&#xD;
"Planned job," almost shrieked Villiers, "What do you mean Y&#xD;
"Why, what I say," cQoliy responded the manager. "Miss Liv-&#xD;
ingston has gone off in a carriage with the 'most notorious profligate&#xD;
in London."&#xD;
"Who? what? " asked Villiers, in utt5 bewilderment.&#xD;
"Why, Miss Livingston has gone away with the Marquis of&#xD;
Westwood."&#xD;
"The Marquis of Westwood! Great God! she is lost!" and&#xD;
Villiers almost staggered, so' powerful an effect did the intelligence&#xD;
have upon him.&#xD;
"Not 'she," replied Mr. de Clifford, "lie always pensions them&#xD;
well off-~when he's tired of them-only she needn't have made such&#xD;
a mystery about it. I'm sorry to lose her, for she was a great draw&#xD;
and no mistake; but I suppose she's like the rest of them, prefers&#xD;
a lady's life to stage work. Blest if I know what's coming over&#xD;
the women; they only seem to come into the profession to make a&#xD;
shorter cut to ruin."&#xD;
"Your observations are, in. the generality of cases i'infortunately&#xD;
too true, but with Marian Livingston I am sure you are wrong,"&#xD;
was the reply of Villiers.&#xD;
"Well I hope so," returned the manager. Then, as if an idea&#xD;
struck him, lie added: "If you really think it wasn't a planned&#xD;
affair, and the letter wasn't a blind, you should make haste if you&#xD;
want to save her."&#xD;
"What shall I do? what can I do?" demanded Villiers.&#xD;
"Why follow them."&#xD;
"Which way did the carriage go?"&#xD;
"Down to Black Ivies, by ihainhiam, in Essex, that's where lie's.&#xD;
gone now, for the coachman passed a joke with my stage door&#xD;
keeper, and told liini their destination."&#xD;
"How am I to get there ?-thiere will be no trains or conveyance&#xD;
at this hour," said Villiers.&#xD;
"No, you'll have to cab it, if you can get a 'slioful ~ to take youj'&#xD;
replied Mr de Clifford. "It's a long journey, but I wish you suc-&#xD;
cess, and you can tell her that the shop's open whenever she likes&#xD;
to come back."&#xD;
With these words Mr. de Clifford shook Villiers heartily by the&#xD;
hand, and the actor hastened on to engage a cab.&#xD;

&#xD;
A cold, bleak wind blew round the walls of Cypress Grange, as&#xD;
Villiers entered the northern shrubbery.&#xD;
He felt its influence, for a slight shiver passed over his frame as&#xD;
he lit a cigar and looked round upon the desolate scene, which ap-&#xD;
pe~red so cold and cheerless in the bright rays of the midnight&#xD;
moon.&#xD;
\Vretched place," he muttered; "ifs enough to give o~ae the&#xD;
horrors."&#xD;
He paced moodily to and fro before the building ~bich he&#xD;
anathematized.&#xD;
And not without cause, for the appearance of the northemen wing&#xD;
of the old edifice was sufficient to make the mind run riot with dis-&#xD;
mal thoughts.&#xD;
This part of the hing had been uninhabited and neglected for&#xD;
more than half a century&#xD;
Iii time time of the previous Dt~ke of Westwood, the whole range&#xD;
of tIme north rooms hac een stripped of their finest pictures and&#xD;
most valuable furniture, to assist iii re-decorating the west rooms,&#xD;
which now formed the only inhabited part of the mansion.&#xD;
The south side itself consisted of stables and out houses, with a&#xD;
ruinous wall in fromit of them.&#xD;
The outside range of north rooms from the weedy, deserted&#xD;
garden and gloomy shrubbery below showed plainly enough that&#xD;
many years had elapsed since any human being had resided in&#xD;
them.&#xD;
The window panes were broken in some places, and in others they&#xD;
were thickly covered in dirt and dust.&#xD;
Here, the shutters were closed; and there, they were only half&#xD;
opened.&#xD;
The untrained ivy, the rank vegetation, growing in fissures of the&#xD;
stonework, the spiders' webs, the rubbish of wood, brick, plaster&#xD;
brok&amp;amp;u glass, rags, and strips of soile(l cloth which lay beneath the&#xD;
windows, all told the same tale of neglect.&#xD;
Shadowed by its position, this ruinous side of the house had a&#xD;
dark, cold, wintery aspect, even in the bright sunny days of that&#xD;
August month.&#xD;
Lost in the labyrinth of his thoughts, Villiers moved slowly past&#xD;
flowerbeds, long since rooted up, and along gravel paths overgrown&#xD;
with weeds, his eyes wandering mechanically over the prospect, and&#xD;
his feet carrying him wherever there was a trace of a footpath.&#xD;
At first his eyes rested~ vacantly on the lonely~ deserted north&#xD;
front of the house; but gradually they became attracted by one&#xD;
l)articular window, exactly in, the middle, on the floor above the&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
This was the largest and gloomiest of all the row. There was,&#xD;
however, one peculiarity about it.&#xD;
A light faintly glimmered through the casement. The' panes of&#xD;
the large windows were yellow with dust and dirt, and festooned&#xD;
about fantastically with cobwebs.&#xD;
Below it was a heap of rubbish scattered over the dry mould of&#xD;
what might once have been a bed of flowers or shrubs.&#xD;
Near this ]ay an iron gai~denLseat, covered with the rust of ages.&#xD;

As these struck the eye of Villiers, his countenance suddenly&#xD;
brightened with an expression of intelligence.&#xD;
He started.&#xD;
A flush of color flew into his cheeks, and he hastily advanced&#xD;
closer to the wall of the house.&#xD;
"I'll risk it," he said to himself, abruptly.  I&#xD;
Then he commenced noiselessly dragging the old iron seat to the&#xD;
top of the mound, and silently raised i&#xD;
beneath the window.              t against the wall, immediately&#xD;
By standing upon it he found that he could place his hands upon&#xD;
the window ledge, and with but slight exertion raised himself up, so&#xD;
as to enter the room.&#xD;
He satisfied himself that the casement ~yas opened..&#xD;
He tried to peer into the room, but the blind prevented him from&#xD;
seeing its occupant.&#xD;
Villiers placed his hands upon the ledge. but a strange feeling&#xD;
came over him, and he paused.&#xD;
"What the devil ails me?" he whispered to himself; "I feel as&#xD;
nervous as a whipped child. There is a strano'e&#xD;
Surely this cannot be fear!"              weight at my heart.&#xD;
He raised his hand to his forehead, and drew away.&#xD;
It was wet.&#xD;
With a muttered oath at his fears, he swung himself up with a&#xD;
vigorous effort, and, thrusting aside the dingy blind, he ~te pped&#xD;
across the ledge and into the room. A dark, sombre apartment~&#xD;
with gloomy, oaken panels, and heavy carvings.&#xD;
In one corner a small camp bedstead, upon which lay the figure&#xD;
of a man.&#xD;
It was the Marquis.&#xD;
It was towards this spot that Villiers glanced.&#xD;
He seemed tb be peacefully slumbering.&#xD;
Taking the lamp in his hand, Villiers approached the bed.&#xD;
He bent over the Marquis. but no sound of regular breathing~&#xD;
reached his ear.&#xD;
Again did the peculiar sensation which had before assailed him&#xD;
strike his heart with a dr adful chill.&#xD;
An irrepressible feeling of awe seemed to overpower him.&#xD;
"Surely this is more thsn 51 eep!" he muttered. " Oh, God!&#xD;
what i~ this!"&#xD;
As be spoke he recoiled from the bed with a thrill of horror.&#xD;
Every drop of blood seemed froze in his veins.&#xD;
His very circulation became stagnant.&#xD;
With a ti~e~nbling hand he drew aside the top of the sheet, which&#xD;
concealed the features of the Marquis, and an ejaciilatioii of terror&#xD;
escaped from his lips~&#xD;
Exposed to his gaze was a countenance blackened, swollen, and&#xD;
distorted, with the agonies of suffocation.&#xD;
With a low cry of honor, Vilhiers reeled like a drunken man, and&#xD;
staggered against the wall of the apartments.&#xD;
He felt weak, sick, and ill.&#xD;
The lamp fell from his enfeebled grasp, and was shivered into 'a&#xD;
thousand fragments.&#xD;
&#xD;

A thousand terrdrs seemed to seize upon his soul, and, for the&#xD;
moment, and he sank beneath the horrors which had fastened upon&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"She has slain him," he muttered to himself; "she has slain him;&#xD;
Oh, Heaven!"&#xD;
Then the thought rushed upon him with the rapidity of lightning~&#xD;
"If I am found here, I shall be accused of this crime!"&#xD;
With a vigorous effort he recovered his self possession, and again&#xD;
slowly approached the bed.&#xD;
He touched the fingers of the murdered man.&#xD;
A. cold chill of death struck into his Yery marrow. and, with ~&#xD;
nameless terror upon him, he hastened to leave by the way he had&#xD;
entered.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.-THE HAND OF PRovIDENCE.-A LIFE&#xD;
sAvED.-A LIFE LOST.&#xD;
THE severe shock caused the aifrighted girl to loose her hold, and&#xD;
with a heart rending shriek, she sank beneath the black river.&#xD;
Rapidly as all this had happened, as rapidly did the banks of&#xD;
the river become thronged with spectators, of all ages and sexes,&#xD;
who with beating hearts and straining eyes anxiously awaited the&#xD;
appearance of our heroine.&#xD;
Here was a splendid opportunity for the hero of our story. In&#xD;
ordinary novel form, the hero of the story is supposed ever to be in&#xD;
the vicinity of his beloved, ready and willing to aid her in any emer-&#xD;
gency, at the risk of his v.ery life.&#xD;
Then where is Mr. George Vilhiers? Ay, indeed.&#xD;
Had he been going to a morning rehearsal at the Royal Victoria&#xD;
he would have had to cross Waterloo Bridge, and might have been&#xD;
attracted by the crowd on the river bank, and God knows but what&#xD;
he might have been the means of rescuing his loved one.&#xD;
As it was, through the sudden disappearance of Marian. hi~&#xD;
health had become seriously affected, and he had not been able t&amp;amp;&#xD;
appear at the Royal Yictoria for over a week.&#xD;
But succour was near, a rough-looking mechanic, who looked in-&#xD;
capable of doing aught else besides emptying pots of beer, and&#xD;
smoking short clay pipes, threw off his coat and cap, and without&#xD;
more ado, sprang boldly into the river.&#xD;
There xv~ts a murmurC of admiration among the spectators on the&#xD;
bank, as he rose to the surface of the water.&#xD;
Brushing his hair back from his eyes, he looked expectantly in&#xD;
every direction. Presently a dark mass of hair appears for an in-&#xD;
stant above the dark stream. There is a loud sudden cr~ of theret&#xD;
there she is."&#xD;
The mechanic darts forward and makes a frantic clutch at the&#xD;
hair, but misses it, and it disappears.&#xD;
Half smothered cries of despair burst from the group on the shore.&#xD;

Now the mechanic has disappeared. Second after second flits by,&#xD;
but nothing appears except a few bubbles. Presently, however'the&#xD;
mechanic appears, with the apparently lifeless form -of the Ballet&#xD;
Girl across his shoulder.&#xD;
A loud shout of applause greets him as he strikes out towards the&#xD;
shore, he makes very slow progress, though the distance between&#xD;
him and the bank is short but he seems a terrible long while reaching it&#xD;
Is it his helpless burden that retards his actions ? He seeins a&#xD;
sturdy fellow ? What can it mean? Will he never reach the, bank ?&#xD;
Ah ! he calls for help, lie struggles desperately, but all in vain.&#xD;
The demon cramp has seized him and his legs become like rigid&#xD;
blocks of stone. Thrusting the young girl towards the shore, he&#xD;
makes a frantic, but impotent effort to follow her, but sinks with a&#xD;
cry of horror-.&#xD;
By wading up to his armpits in the water, a youth managed to&#xD;
catch hdld of Marian's dress and drag her to shore, where a hundred-&#xD;
ready hands awaited him.&#xD;
In the meantime a boat had been put off, ~and every effort made&#xD;
to save the mechanic, but in vain, When his body was recovered&#xD;
life was extinct-.&#xD;
Yes, this obscure hero, this nature's nobleman who had little&#xD;
worldly possessions to give in charity, had given his very life to&#xD;
save a stranger's; ay, and there are thousands like him to be seen&#xD;
in our. City of London every day-.&#xD;
He had been spending his dinner hour by the side of the river,&#xD;
and he had met his doom-.&#xD;
Alas for the generous thought- that prompted the act-also for&#xD;
the anxious wife and babes-that await his coming home.&#xD;
Unromantic as it may seem, after receiving a stiff glass of brandy,&#xD;
from some friendly hand, Marian was hurried off to the nearest work-&#xD;
house, as speedily as possible by the blue-coated guardias of the&#xD;
streets.&#xD;
Having every attention paid her, she soon recovered, and was able&#xD;
to satisfy the master af the workhouse, that her presence in the river&#xD;
was the result of accident.&#xD;
She considered it. prudent to keep her name and the particulars&#xD;
of her story secret, but her first thoughts were to send 'for her old&#xD;
and tried friend, George Villiers.&#xD;

UPON THE' sCENE---ANOTHER- DANGER THREATENs THE BALLET GIRL.&#xD;
BACK to Black Ivies, back' to some half dozen frightened servitors,&#xD;
who, half awake and partly dressed, had been awakened from their&#xD;
slumbers by the loud clanging of the alarm bell, which aroused the&#xD;
echoes of the night.&#xD;
The search, led by the gardener then commenced; the outer doors&#xD;
were opened, and with trembling steps, they sought around but&#xD;
without any great success; that the mansion had been entered there&#xD;
was no doubt.&#xD;

The moon shone through the thick foliage, and they saw upon the&#xD;
dewy grass the irnprints of many foot-steps  mnadaes&#xD;
Evidently there had been a struggle of many mnadads&#xD;
perate struggle too.&#xD;
A little further on was a pool of blood, and gory stains befouled&#xD;
the green herbage which grew so abundantly around, and the dead&#xD;
body of the faithful house-dog was speedily discovered,&#xD;
Without doubt it was an attempted burglary.&#xD;
Crouching near the ground, and holding their lanterns low, the&#xD;
foremost of the party proceeded on their way.&#xD;
Through the dark and lonely plantation which surrou~ndedl Black&#xD;
ivies they slowly followed the sanguinary trail,&#xD;
With pale visages, but with the determination of sleuth hounds&#xD;
they could distinctly trace the path which hadl been followed;&#xD;
suddenly they were aroused by one of the party, who uttered an ex-&#xD;
claniation of astonishment, all looked in the direction in which he&#xD;
pointed.&#xD;
Lying upon the ground was a woman's cloak.&#xD;
Advancing towards it with hasty steps the old gardener picked it&#xD;
up. "This," he, said "may furnish some clue to the mystery."&#xD;
Then bidding his associates to follow him he hastened back to the&#xD;
house to confer with his master, the Marquis of Westwood, who, in&#xD;
the first moment of their alarm they had forgotten.&#xD;
To their astonishment, lights were moving about the northern&#xD;
wing ; quickening their footsteps they neared the building, when&#xD;
they were met by the old hag who acted as housekeeper.&#xD;
In disjointed sentences she informed them of the murder of the&#xD;
Marquis, and the disappearance of Marian, while at~ the same time&#xD;
her eyes fell upon the cloak which the gardener carried.&#xD;
"Where did you find this?" demanded the hag.&#xD;
The gardener told her.&#xD;
" Then the girl to whom that cloak belonged committed the&#xD;
murder," cried the old woman vehemently, "I know it by the trim-&#xD;
mings."&#xD;
Without more ado, the gardener despatched one of the men with&#xD;
a telegram to the chief police office in London, desiring the inspec-&#xD;
tor on duty to send a detective down to Black Ivies at once.&#xD;
And then he visited the apartment where the dead body of his&#xD;
master lay, and there remained until the local police arrived to take&#xD;
possession of the premises.&#xD;
An early train brought down Gilbert Hawke, the' detective, who,&#xD;
wth irapid professional dispatch proceeded to put matters into a&#xD;
An when he heard of the abduction of Marian Livingston from&#xD;
the theatre-her arrival at Black Ivies-the mysterious murder of&#xD;
the Marquis, and her strange disappearance, he gave a long low whis-&#xD;
tle, expressive of the most profound astonishment.&#xD;
"Well," lie muttered to himself, "this beats cock fighting into&#xD;
fits. Here's this blessed girl of George Villiers turning up again.&#xD;
She's like the heroine of one of Miss Braddon's novels,. always in&#xD;
some scrape, and getting mixed up in other people's 'affairs. I don't&#xD;
believe that she's had anything to do with the murder ; but it looks&#xD;

VILLIERs AND MARIAN.--LOvERS s vows.--BRGHTER DAYS IN STor(E-.&#xD;
SEVERAL days have passed since the recovery of ou/r heroine from&#xD;
the effects of the river's chill, and when next we behold her she was&#xD;
seated beside her now acknowledged suitor George Villiers.&#xD;
The scene is the snug little sitting room of the above-named&#xD;
gentleman.&#xD;
There is no light save the cheerful blaze of the bright coal fire,&#xD;
that casts a ruddy tint upon the features of Marian, who look's&#xD;
positively lovelier than ever, upon the evening in question.&#xD;
George, sly fellow that he is, has got his arm around her waist,&#xD;
her lovely head rests upon his shoulder, and her hand in his.'&#xD;
George's sister has been sent upon a long, bootless errand. and&#xD;
the lovers are supremely happy.&#xD;
"Bless you, my own darling Marian, you don't know how great is&#xD;
my happiness to fold you again to my heart, for I had given up all&#xD;
hpe ofesou I demed you los to me fr ever," murmured Vill-&#xD;
" And I need not assure you further than I havn already,~ dear&#xD;
George, how happy I am at being again restored to you," said&#xD;
Marian, "only I fear the persecutions of the Marquis of West-&#xD;
wood."&#xD;
.Then let your fears rest, for on the night he carried you off to&#xD;
Black Ivies, he was murdered ; but let 'us change the subject, dear-&#xD;
est, let us forget the yast, and talk of the future. I saw Mr. de-&#xD;
Clifford to day, and told him the whole affair, from beginning to end&#xD;
and when I had finished, he said that ' the shop' was still open to -&#xD;
you, and he should be only too glad to see yoti back again and&#xD;
'under the rose,' said he, 'there has been a great falling off of&#xD;
patronage, since Miss Livingston's absence, and he begged me to&#xD;
let hin announce you for Wednesday next.".&#xD;
"And did you give your consent," she asked,' with mock dis-&#xD;
pleasure.&#xD;
"No! dearest, not until I had consulted you, but when I came&#xD;
homne from the theatre to-night, there it was, on flaming colored&#xD;
bills, as large as life."&#xD;

"Then I suppose I have no alternative but to accept the engage-&#xD;

"As you please dearest, for my part, I should like to keep you off&#xD;
the, boards altogether. Answer me freely, Marian dear, will you be&#xD;

"Yes, George, with feelings of deepest joy, here is my hand, and&#xD;
with it my heart, and may Heaven deny me its mercy if ever I prove&#xD;
false to y on," said Marian fervently. ,&#xD;
"Bless you, my darling," cried Villiers rapturously, catching her&#xD;
in his arms and smothering her lips with burning k.isses.ht&#xD;
"I shall engage myself to Mr, de Clifford for three months at&#xD;
least, and by the end of that time, I also shall be able to have a&#xD;

" You intend to appear at the Slap-up Saloon, then," said \Tliers.&#xD;
"Most assuredly," replied Marian.&#xD;

CEIAPTER XVI.&#xD;
A DECIDED SUCCESs.--A STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED SCENE. -REAL OFFICERS&#xD;
AND A REAL ARREST.&#xD;
THE Royal Slap-up Saloon was crowded to suffocation on the&#xD;
night of Marian's re-appearance, there was not even standing room,&#xD;
and lots were unable to gain admission at all.&#xD;
The audience wanted Marian Livingston, and her only, and when&#xD;
she did make her appearance upon the stage, her reception baffles&#xD;
description.&#xD;
There was deafening whistling, loud clapping of hands, and&#xD;
perfect shouts of applause, and it was full three minutes before it&#xD;
subsided, during which Marian bowed her acknowledgments over and&#xD;
over again.&#xD;
She certainly looked charming in the elegant costume she wore,&#xD;
that fitted her faultless figure to advantage, and displayed fully her&#xD;
fair and graceful proportions.&#xD;
She entertained her hearens with a new burlesque sketch written&#xD;
for the occasion, and she had just concluded, when two real detec-&#xD;
tives came bounding on the stage. and seized hold of our heroine.&#xD;
"Your name is Miss Marian Livingston, is it not? " said one.&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7723-00000024"/>&#xD;
"Yes," gasped our heroine, in a terror-stricken whisper.&#xD;
"Then I charge you with the murder of the Marquis of West-&#xD;
wood."&#xD;
~ "Surely you cannot mean what you say," she cried, fully realis-&#xD;
ing the danger of her position, "I am innocent of the charge, indeed&#xD;
I am."&#xD;
"I hope you are, Miss," returned the officer, somewhatt gently,&#xD;
"I hope you are for your own sake, but that you ~vi1l have to prove&#xD;
before a magistrate. You will haVP to come with us Miss-"&#xD;
Mr. de Clifford. confronted the officers, and wanted to know what&#xD;
it was all about.&#xD;
One of the detectives explained.&#xD;
"Well, I think, at least, you might have waited until the young&#xD;
lady had left the stage.&#xD;
Shouts of approval greeted this declaration.&#xD;
"We had orders to take her the moment we clapped eyes on her,&#xD;
for fear she should escape us," explained the officer.&#xD;
"~Drop the curtain," thundered the indignant proprietor.&#xD;
That night poor Marian passed in a common police cell.&#xD;

IN&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
AT length the momentous day that was to decide Marian's fate&#xD;
arrived. The Court was crowded with spectators, and when our&#xD;
heroine was led trembling and sobbing into the dock, a mingled&#xD;
V              murmijir of pity and admiration could be plainly heard in every part&#xD;
of the Building.&#xD;
Thejudge having partaken of a slight refreshment, which occu-&#xD;
pied that worthy gentleman considerably over half an hour, took&#xD;
his seat, and the trial commenced.&#xD;
Marian related in a voice broken with emotion, the particulars of&#xD;
her abduction, the forged letter she received at the Royal Slap-up&#xD;
Saloon, her mysterious journey to Black Ivies, how, when she arrived&#xD;
there she was locked in a room, and never saw the Marquis after,&#xD;
and how she wa~ also re-abducted from Black Ivies by the burglar&#xD;
Ralph Dearwood, the man who called himself her uncle, how she was&#xD;
confined in the cellar by him, her flight through tue sewer, her im-&#xD;
mersion in the Thames, and finally her rescue from death.&#xD;
The pathetic and artless manner in which she told her story,&#xD;
Marian's and which the old housekeeper found in the Marquis's&#xD;
riveted the attention of all present, even the doubts of the strong-&#xD;
minded judge seemed somewhat shaken.&#xD;
But when the cloak was produced, (which was identified as.&#xD;
C&#xD;
at     Ivies,) matters took a vastly different turn, and&#xD;
Villiers had gone to the expense of engaging coun-&#xD;
sel for his beloved one, and they pleaded eloquently in her defence,&#xD;
the impression the production of the cloak had created in the mind&#xD;
of the judge remained just the same till the conclusion.&#xD;

&#xD;
The judge and jury now retired from Court, to decide theii~&#xD;
verdict.&#xD;
A buzz of excitement followed their exit, which lasted for some&#xD;
time.&#xD;
They seemed to the impatient spectators as though they would&#xD;
never return, so long were they absent.&#xD;
The suspense shared by the disinterested parties was bad enough&#xD;
but not a thousandth part of the torture that tore th~ heait, and&#xD;
racked the brain of George Villiers. He feared the worst, and it&#xD;
was almost more than he could do to conceal from the coarse eye of&#xD;
the curious4 that poignant anguish which was likely to impair his&#xD;
reason for ever.&#xD;
As for poor Marian, she had scarcely beemi conscious a minute&#xD;
since the disappearance of her judges. and when they did return4&#xD;
and pronounced a verdict of wilful murder against Marian Living-&#xD;
ston, she uttered a heartrending shriek that sent a thrill, through&#xD;
every breast, then fell back as if lifeless, caught in the arms of her&#xD;
jailers, who carried her gently from the dock.&#xD;
The hitherto stoical judge seemed deeply affected, and there was&#xD;
not a dry eye to be seen in Court.&#xD;
When Villiers heard the hoi rible doom of her he loved better than&#xD;
life itself, he fell to the earth as if shot. ii~ a swoon.&#xD;

ON THE TRACK.-THE 5TRUGGLE.-THE E5CAPE.-RALPH REACHES LIVER-&#xD;
POOL.-APPEARANCE OF THE DETECTIvE.-THE CAPTURE.--CO~FE55ION.&#xD;
-DEATH OF RALPH.&#xD;
THE news of the mysterious murder of the Marquis of Westwood&#xD;
spread throughout the land, with the swiftness of electricity. The&#xD;
papers were full of it, painting it in a most vivid and lucid manner.&#xD;
The question was, who did the deed?&#xD;
Gilbert Hawk the detective, had taken upon himself the respond&#xD;
sibility of the answer.&#xD;
Nothing had escaped his keen business ey and on the day of his&#xD;
(professional visit to Black Ivies, he discover ci many little bits of&#xD;
evidence that were likely to furnish him with a clue to the mystery,&#xD;
iN which both the murder and the robbery was wrapped.&#xD;
On one piece of proof, he was determined to act without further&#xD;
loss of tune, which was simply this :-he had traced the wheels of&#xD;
the trap (which had contained the burglars and their booty), to that&#xD;
inn of doubtful repute, the "Flying Highwayman,9' jn Dead Man's&#xD;
Lane.&#xD;
When he reached the "Flying Highwayman," he found the pot-&#xD;
man putting the shutters up, as if no more customers were expected.&#xD;
Entering the house, Hawke discovered the landlord sipping some&#xD;
hot rum.&#xD;
"What do you want to know," asked the landlor~1 eagerly.&#xD;
"I want to know who were the men who did that job over yonder&#xD;
the. other night," said Hawke qtiietly; "Oh don't look so innocent,&#xD;

you know what I mean, the robbery and murder that was committed&#xD;
at Black Ivies. Who were the men?&#xD;
"Well then, it was Ralph Dearwood's sang that committed the&#xD;
robbery, but whether he committed the murder, I can't say," stain-&#xD;
mered the landlord.&#xD;
"Yes," said Hawke, writing in his note book, and the next ques-..&#xD;
tion is, where shall I Iind them i?"&#xD;
"The Old House, in Pye Street. London."&#xD;
"Are you sure," said the detective, eyeing him searchingly over&#xD;
the top of his book, "for I would have you remember, that if you&#xD;
send me on a fool's errand, it will be the worst day's work you ever&#xD;
did in your life, so beware."&#xD;
"He went straight to Pye Street after the robbery, but he told&#xD;
me he should start fGr America to-morrow."&#xD;
"I have succeeded better than I thought for," muttered Hawk-e&#xD;
to himself, "I am on the right track at last, and will never rest&#xD;
~intil I have brought the villian to justice."&#xD;
On arriving at the house in Pye Street, Hawke soon found the&#xD;
room occupied bV the robber Dearwood.&#xD;
"Now to slip the handcuffs on while he sleeps," mentally exclaim-&#xD;
ed Hawke as he took them from his -pocket, and approached the bed.&#xD;
But at this juncture, Ralph Dearxvood started in his sleep, and&#xD;
partly woke up with a loud cry of alarm.&#xD;
Gilbert Hawke saw that he had failed to secure his man thus far,&#xD;
drawing his pistol from his pocket, he cried, "Surrender, Ralph&#xD;
Dearwood, or you are a dead man," Ralph returned no answer to&#xD;
his thicat, but quick as lightning knocked~ the pistol from the detec-&#xD;
tive's g-rasp, which went off with a loud report.&#xD;
Then commenced a struggle of a ~most desperate nature. They&#xD;
were both powerful men, and the contest was severe in the extreme,&#xD;
and they rolled over and over upon the floor, kicking, biting, punch-&#xD;
ing, dashing one' another's heads upon the hard boards until they&#xD;
were stained with blood. Now they were upon their feet again.&#xD;
dealing each other the most dreadful blows, hissing like angry&#xD;
serpents as they delivered them, and panting like hunted beasts, as&#xD;
the blood streamed down from their hands and faces,&#xD;
Just as Hawke had overpowered his antagonist, and ~vas in the&#xD;
act of Slipping on the derbies. a blow on the head from behind laid&#xD;
him on the floor, insensible.&#xD;
Well done, Jerry, ~vell done!" gasped Ralph, you have just&#xD;
saved my bacon, another moment he would have had those cursed&#xD;
bracelets on my wrists, and then he would have been more than a&#xD;
match for both of us."&#xD;
Wearing the disguise of a farmer~, and losing as little time as&#xD;
possible, Ralph, with a number of other emigrants, got on board a&#xD;
noble vessel called the 'Venture.'&#xD;
&#xD;
IUI day lie remained below, walking up and down the cabin with&#xD;
rapid strides, bursting with smothered fury and impatience.&#xD;
In this manner he passed the whole of the day, and when evening&#xD;
came he ventured on deck, muffled in such a manner that only his&#xD;
nose was visible.&#xD;

One of the sailors passed close by him, and in a low voice Ralph&#xD;
asked him when the ship would sail.&#xD;
"At daybreak," returned the sailor, as he passed on.&#xD;
"Good," muttered the burglar to himself; "I've watchedd pretty&#xD;
closely all day long who's come aboard, and I aint ~een anyone as&#xD;
lodks anything like a detective. I think I have man ed the busi&#xD;
ness proper this go. I've got the swag nicely stowed away in my&#xD;
trunk, and in a few hours more I shall be free, free!"&#xD;
"Not so," cried a voice at his elbows "not while I hate life to&#xD;
take you."&#xD;
The ruffian gazed up with a look of alarm, and there, in the moon&#xD;
light looking like a spirit from another world, stood the form of&#xD;
Gilbert Hawke, the detective.&#xD;
"By Heavens you shall not escape me, surrender !" he cried&#xD;
levelling a pistol at the other's head.&#xD;
The ruffian saw that his chance of escape was hopeless and he&#xD;
knew that if he was taken his doom would be the scaffold.&#xD;
"I surrender," he cried, holding Qut his hands for the steel cuffs~&#xD;
The detective lowered his pistol, and in an instant the burglar&#xD;
drew a sharp murderous looking dirk from his breast coat pocket,&#xD;
and made a stab at Hawke, who, at once took aim and fired. There&#xD;
was a report and a cry of agony, the ball had carried true.&#xD;
Ralph knew that his moments were numbered, and was in a fever&#xD;
of anxiety to disclose all he knew that was likely to be of any ser-&#xD;
vice tu the ballet girl, before he drew his last breath.&#xD;
He stated that on the night of the abduction of Marian Living-&#xD;
ston, lie had broken into Black Ivies, as we have already described,&#xD;
but the Marquis discovering him and his fellows, they had taken his&#xD;
life to prevent prosecution and punishment; during the revelation&#xD;
of his ci'ime, his voice sunk to a whisper, that was scarcely audible,&#xD;
ever and anon fighting for breath to finish his arduous t~sk, and on&#xD;
its completion, his spirit passed away.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
THE INNOcENcE OF THE BALLET GIRL.-HER REcEPTION BY THE BRITISH&#xD;
PUBLIc.-vILLIERs DOUBTS AND FEAR5.-RE-UNITED.&#xD;
THE ballet girl became quite an heroine of romance in the eyes of&#xD;
the British public. And loud was the, voice of indignation against&#xD;
the accusing judges; but it mattered not now, her innocence was&#xD;
established in the eyes of the whole world.&#xD;
What o-lorious news to her grief-stricken lover, George Villiers.&#xD;
He had already pictured her as lost to him for ever. He knew from&#xD;
the first she was innocent, but he also knew and felt that he was as&#xD;
impotent as a child to prove it; he felt that there was no hope&#xD;
for her.&#xD;
Had he not been blessed with a sound constitution, George Vill-&#xD;
iers would have fallen a victim to that fell disease-insanity, so ex-&#xD;
cessive was the rack of mind and body.&#xD;
But noxv her fair name was cleared of the foul charge of murder&#xD;
her prison doors were thrown open and she was free to depart.&#xD;

Mr. Bowers had been present at the performance of our heroine,&#xD;
at the "Royal Slap-up Saloon," on the night of her arrest, in cour-&#xD;
pany with Mr. de Clifford, and he expi-essed himself very much&#xD;
pleased with her appearance and her style of talent, and now that&#xD;
the forthcoming pantomime was the sole subject of his thoughts, and&#xD;
the circusm stances of lV[arian has been put to him by Villiers, he con~&#xD;
sidered she would be a great draw, being shapely, and a great&#xD;
public character, also possessing a charming appearance, a good&#xD;
Voice, and considerable ability as an actress, that he engaged her at&#xD;
once to play Prince in the pantomime, at doublee the salary offered&#xD;
by Mr. de Clifford, and Mai-ian accepted the engagement with joy.&#xD;
We have little more to say, save that Marian gave her hand and.&#xD;
herrl to Gem-ge Villiers. -&#xD;
She still continued to appear on the stage, for her reputatioii as&#xD;
anactress was now considerable, as was her salary also. which en-&#xD;
abled the lovers (for although man and wife, they were lovers still,)&#xD;
to have many comforts they woiAd not otherwise have enjoyed.&#xD;
After six months &amp;amp; nm-i-ied life, which was a season of uninter-&#xD;
