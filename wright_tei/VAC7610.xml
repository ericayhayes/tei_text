CHAPTER I.&#xD;
HERo MAKES HIS BOW TO THE&#xD;
READER.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was night on the Western prairies and the&#xD;
stars were glowing silvery and soft tuae azure&#xD;
arch. . The gauzy spray of clouds sailing at in-&#xD;
tervals across the quiet heavens, obscured not&#xD;
the mild lustre of the moon, nor cast a shadow&#xD;
upon the wilderness.&#xD;
A youth of slender figure, clad in garb befit-&#xD;
ting the hunter and backwoodsman, was stand-&#xD;
ing with meditative brow upon a gentle emi-&#xD;
nence, leaning gracefully upon his rifle, which&#xD;
was ofapproved make and studied finish. His&#xD;
features,, though not strongly masculine in&#xD;
mould, were not uncomely, nor without' the&#xD;
prestige of thought. His. maturity of expres-&#xD;
sion was notably in contrastwith his otherwise&#xD;
youthful personne.- His eyes were somewhat&#xD;
dreamy, impressing the physiognomist with the&#xD;
idea that his imagination dwelt in a world vague&#xD;
and impracticable, far removed from the scenes&#xD;
of this but too real sphere._&#xD;
Below him, at the base of the hill, the waters&#xD;
of Kansas River, were flowing ; while at his&#xD;
left the distant peaks of the Rocky Mountains&#xD;
were visible, towering in their stern, unchang-&#xD;
ing grandeur like everlasting guardians of the&#xD;
North-an army of eternal occupation, which&#xD;
the might of" finite man can never conquer ;&#xD;
upon his right, prairies unfolded their scenery&#xD;
like an endless panorama, diversified by strips&#xD;
of timber, swamps of grass, and shrubbery. At&#xD;
a short'distance from the youth, the smoke of&#xD;
a blazing fire arose in a misty column, forming&#xD;
numberless fantastic wreaths and phantom&#xD;
shapes. A solitary figure was.stretched beside&#xD;
the burning faggots, sleeping as soundly, appar-&#xD;
ently, as if domiciled beneath a sheltering roof,&#xD;
and couched upon the softest bed. The youth&#xD;
approached the spot ; at the sound of his foot-&#xD;
&#xD;
steps the man sprang to his feet, casting quick,&#xD;
sharp glances around him. In a moment his&#xD;
gaze was fastened upon the intruder, and he re-&#xD;
laxed his guarded watchfulness. With his&#xD;
raven eyes he scanned the object that had ex-&#xD;
cited his attention, with stronger indications of&#xD;
contempt than curiosity or alarm. The youth&#xD;
advanced, and begging pardon for the intru-&#xD;
sion, expressed a hope that he hadinot disturbed&#xD;
his dreams or awakened his fears.&#xD;
The person to whom these words were ad-&#xD;
dressed, smiled ; and'turning his back partially&#xD;
toward the youth, replied, rather sarcastically,&#xD;
that he seldom took the trouble to dream ; as&#xD;
for fear, Ben Brion was a stranger to it, and&#xD;
had certainly seen nothing to excite such an&#xD;
emotion for a long time. He trusted he had too&#xD;
long been a sojourner in the West to be terri-&#xD;
fied at trifles. He then stroked his beard,&#xD;
shrugged his shoulders, and smiled again. The&#xD;
young man doubtless understood the stranger's&#xD;
meaning, but without appearing to notice it,&#xD;
added, that if his company would not be con-&#xD;
sidered particularly disagreeable,he would ven-&#xD;
ture to take a seat by the fire, which seemed&#xD;
to him very cheerful and inviting.&#xD;
The individual who had styled himself Ben&#xD;
Brion replied, that he was at liberty to please&#xD;
himself in that respect, though lie fancied that&#xD;
a stuffed chair, or a feather bed, would agree&#xD;
better with his constitution than any accom-&#xD;
modation he could offer. The youth answered&#xD;
to the effect that he was not fastidious ; that a&#xD;
blazing fire would suffice for a night so serene&#xD;
and tranquil. He seated himself, placed his&#xD;
rifle on the gtbund beside hini, and instead of&#xD;
turning his attention to Brion, resumed his&#xD;
study of the heavens with an abstracted air.&#xD;
At first, Brion seareely deigned to notice the&#xD;
stripling ; but presently condescended to honor&#xD;
him with furtive glances, which, judging by&#xD;
the express on of his features, did not inereese&#xD;
his esteem for his visitor. He obviously eon-&#xD;

keenly awake to strategy and covert dealing. There was the prestige of fun in his small&#xD;
Pietrast, once aroused, is apt to thrive on petty  eyes, which had a constant twinkle. His iife&#xD;
&#xD;
was slung across his back by a leather strap&#xD;
When. within fifty rods of Ben Brion, h&#xD;
raised a loud war-whoop and put his beast to:&#xD;
gallop, performing a series of Indian evolution&#xD;
with ludicrous effect. He made two circle&#xD;
round the mountaineer at a full run, clinging t&#xD;
the farther side of the animal, and peering&#xD;
over his back as if reconnoitering in true ab&#xD;
original style, shouting and yelliiig.&#xD;
To humorhis whim, Brion dismounted an&#xD;
rested his rifle on the pommel of his saddle to&#xD;
receive him with the precaution due to his a6.&#xD;
sumed character. The stranger gradually drew&#xD;
near, and the parties, with proper formality&#xD;
saluted, and extended the hand of friendship.&#xD;
Many such meetings transpire 'on the wid&#xD;
prairies of the West. Whatever feeling o&#xD;
distrust Brion was disposed to harbor at first&#xD;
gave place to geniality, when he learned thai&#xD;
his new acquaintance' was not connected with&#xD;
any organized fur company, but prided himself&#xD;
in belonging to that' roving, independent class&#xD;
known as free trappers; whose homes were the&#xD;
mountains and prairies, and whose pleasure&#xD;
was the excitement of danger.&#xD;
Buckeye-such was the rover's name-was&#xD;
in good spirits, and enlivened the way by his&#xD;
witticisms and strange tales. At nightfall,&#xD;
they encamped together quite amicably, Brion&#xD;
taking considerable pains to enlist Buckeye in&#xD;
his brigade of hunters; but he intimated that&#xD;
he preferred liberty to the gold and authority&#xD;
of a partisan leader.&#xD;
Another serene evening followed.  Unable&#xD;
to sleep, Brion left his hard couch to contem-&#xD;
plate the starry beauties of the night, and&#xD;
muse upon the arduous duties upon which he&#xD;
was entering. The placid skies, the mellow&#xD;
light, the murmur of glistening waters, ad-&#xD;
dressed his consciousness like pleasant voices.&#xD;
While yielding to the soothing influences&#xD;
around him, and gazing dreamily at the varied&#xD;
aspects, Brion fancied he heard a slight move-&#xD;
ment ineagroup of young poplars at his right.&#xD;
Disciplined in.a school of severest watchful-&#xD;
ness,t ee as alive to sounds inaudible to un-&#xD;
practiced ears. He advanced cautiously to-&#xD;
ward the spot whence the noise proceeded.&#xD;
He imagined, as he parted the branches of the&#xD;
trees, and stepped intothe thicket, he caught&#xD;
a vague glance of an object in rapid motion&#xD;
beyond theabushes, deeper in thershadow. It&#xD;
might have been a human figure, or it might&#xD;
have been but the reflection of a cloud thrown&#xD;
transiently upon the open space  With his&#xD;
rifle ready for instant use, Brion moved foi-&#xD;
ward. On the margin of the wood, he paused&#xD;
and examined the locality. He was much sur-&#xD;
prised at finding an Indian hatchet sticking&#xD;
into a tree near him. He drew it forth; the&#xD;
handle was yet warm from the belt of its&#xD;
owner. A minute had not elapsed, obviously,&#xD;
since it had been hurled into the yielding&#xD;
bark. The mountaineerlooked for a fresh trail,&#xD;
&#xD;
. but was for some time unsuccessful, until going&#xD;
e farther from the tree, he found a spot where&#xD;
a the grass was bent, as if pressed by a huma&#xD;
s foot. He followed the trail for a few  rods,&#xD;
s when it suddenly ceased ; he could trace it no&#xD;
o farther.&#xD;
g The circumstance perplexed Brion greatly',&#xD;
- for his skill in tracing a trail amounted almost&#xD;
to instinct. Ascending a ridge close at hand,&#xD;
d ,he scanned the country on either side as far as.&#xD;
he could see, but without making any addi-&#xD;
- tional discovery. He returned to his camp-&#xD;
fire, thoughtful. Buckeye was sleeping, and&#xD;
" Flash," his horse, was standingelose by hime.&#xD;
with ears erect and vigilant. Trained, like his&#xD;
e master, to a life of peril, like him he had&#xD;
f learned watchfulness. Some sound had reached&#xD;
, him to excite his fears or curiosity, and put hiia&#xD;
t on the alert.&#xD;
- " Faithful creature !" nfused Brion. ""Ex-&#xD;
f perience has quickened his senses, and made&#xD;
him little inferior to reasoning beings"&#xD;
The partisan (the leaders of these enterprises&#xD;
were thus called) awaked the trapper, and re-&#xD;
lated what had occurred. Buckeye stirred the&#xD;
a fire, took a bite of tobacco, rubbed his forA&#xD;
head, and gave signs of uneasiness.&#xD;
"There's a great difference in sarenmstan.&#xD;
ces," quoth he, sagely. "Some things are easy&#xD;
to explain and some isn't !"&#xD;
When he had expressed this sentiment. he&#xD;
aimed a jet of dark-colored extract at a hlazing&#xD;
brand. "Flash," hearing his moister's well-&#xD;
known voice, came up and placed his no'e oi&#xD;
his shoulder, as if soliciting coinpan ionsh ip.&#xD;
" The cretur knows me, stranger, and is&#xD;
restless when I'm a good way off We conild-t&#xD;
part, Flash and I couldn't. 'Twould be a sorry&#xD;
day for both of us, if he should change owners.&#xD;
But I.hope that'll never be. 'Twould break his&#xD;
heart to have a redskin back him. - But that's&#xD;
nothing to do with the subject; aul, is i said&#xD;
afore, in different words, some matters are&#xD;
mighty mysterious, and hard to get at under.&#xD;
standingly. There's strange characters in this&#xD;
wild kentry, and one don't allers know what's&#xD;
arter him. The nateral reptiles of the soil have&#xD;
a heap of cunnin', and it's never safe to shet&#xD;
both eyes at night. We're tracked -that's&#xD;
evident enough ; but by who i, is another&#xD;
question. There's danger at our backs, hut&#xD;
which of us two is spoke for, I can't say. I'll&#xD;
tell you more about it artery we've passed Fort&#xD;
Laramie ; that is, if we both -should he alive&#xD;
then."&#xD;
" It would he well to move off, leaving oeu&#xD;
fire burning, I suppose," returned Brion  fit&#xD;
is our duty to be reasonably cautious and care-&#xD;
ful of life. There's a Scriptural injunction laid'.&#xD;
upon us to be wise as serpents."&#xD;
"If a parson had said that, it couldn't hare&#xD;
been more to the p'int. I know of a very quiet&#xD;
campin'-ground a few miles farther on, where&#xD;
I passed a night, some months ago, when the&#xD;

&#xD;
heathen reptiles had somehow got wind of my&#xD;
movements."&#xD;
The parties mounted their horses, and the fire,&#xD;
where they had anticipated, passing an undis-&#xD;
turbed night, was soon far behind The spot&#xD;
referred to by Buckeye proved a fitting place&#xD;
for their purpose, being sheltered by large&#xD;
rocks and trees, and hemmed by a crescent-like&#xD;
bend in the river.&#xD;
Brion felt at home. The wide sky arching&#xD;
over him in unveiled beauty, with its starry&#xD;
hosts ; the spreading prairies, the distant moun-&#xD;
tains, tue running waters and fluttering leaves,&#xD;
were things that had voices, and addressed him&#xD;
with pleasant language. The mountaineer was&#xD;
entirely satisfied with his mode of life. He felt&#xD;
no desire to be other than he was. There was&#xD;
a charm (for him) in the atmosphere of the wil-&#xD;
derness ; while the certainty of danger added&#xD;
new zest --making him more in love with his&#xD;
calling. Like Buckeye, he had been a free&#xD;
trapper, but the strong inducement held out to&#xD;
him'by the American Fur Company, had (after&#xD;
considerable hesitation and rather against his&#xD;
independent predilections) caused him to accept&#xD;
the post of4 partisan," or leader of the enter-&#xD;
prise. He knew it was a trying and difficult&#xD;
position, but trusted that he should be able, by&#xD;
his experience in trapping and hunting, to give&#xD;
satisfaction to all concerned.&#xD;
When he resumed his way on the ensuing&#xD;
morning, the glowing stories of Buckeye, con-&#xD;
cerning the pleasures and excitement of a free&#xD;
trappers existence, made him half regret his&#xD;
engagement.   Before noon he overtook the&#xD;
band, consisting of about seventy-five men,&#xD;
amply provided with pack-horses and mules. .&#xD;
"6I wast no sich'ereters as them," said Buck-&#xD;
eye, pointing to the latter, with a contemptu-&#xD;
ous expression. " And as for baggage, a real&#xD;
trapper needs nothin' but his gun, huntin'-&#xD;
knife, and traps. Themmen are slaves to their&#xD;
mules and packs. No, no ! I couldn't think of&#xD;
such a life ! Give me Flash, and this trusty&#xD;
weapon, and the sky for my roof, and the prai-&#xD;
rie for my floor, with nobody to dictate what I&#xD;
shall or shan't do, and I ask nomore."&#xD;
With this pithy epitome of his sentiments,&#xD;
Buckeye shouted "Hi, hi!" performed some&#xD;
difficult feats of horsemanship, then abating&#xD;
somewhat of his equestrian fury, joked the slow-&#xD;
paced brigade unmercifully, contrasting their&#xD;
encumbered march with his own untrammelled,&#xD;
unburdened movements. In Brion's estimation,&#xD;
there was too much truth in such badinage to&#xD;
make it altogether agreeable to the moderately-&#xD;
moving party. Flash, in return, received criti-&#xD;
cisms not complimentary to himself or his mas-&#xD;
ter, but which were borne by the latter with&#xD;
perfect equanimity.&#xD;
We cannot here make the reader acquainted&#xD;
with the various individuals of which the band&#xD;
was composed. There were French and hall-&#xD;
treeds, a few of Mexican origin-the greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
number being Americans from frontier towns&#xD;
There was also a Texan adventurer, a Kentuck&#xD;
ian, a Virginian, and a young fellow from Mas.&#xD;
sachusetts. Many were veteran trappers, while&#xD;
some were fresh on the prairies, unpracticed in&#xD;
the arts and expedients of hunter life.  Thus&#xD;
far on their march all had gone well. The In-&#xD;
dians had not molested them ; and grass boeing&#xD;
abundant, the horses and mules were in good&#xD;
condition. The young and unschooled in the&#xD;
kind of existence opening before them, feared&#xD;
they should reach the distant theatre of opera-&#xD;
tions without incident or excitement, or adven-&#xD;
tures worth relating when they should again&#xD;
reach home; but the wiserheads shrugged their&#xD;
shoulders, intimating very plainly that danger&#xD;
might come before they were ready for it.&#xD;
They passed Fort Laramie with nothing to&#xD;
break the monotony of their march. The jubi-&#xD;
lant spirits of the younger men began to flag;&#xD;
continued travel had already taken the first&#xD;
starch of greenness out of them. Seeing how&#xD;
smoothly things were proceeding, they grew&#xD;
less vigilant ; ridiculed the precautions of Brion;&#xD;
wishing for an opportunity to show the red-&#xD;
skins what they could do," boasting in no mea-&#xD;
sured terms their ability to teach them civili-&#xD;
ty.  Buckeye, who continued with the band,&#xD;
heard all this bravado in silence, feeling more&#xD;
inejined to feed their vanity than to rebuke their&#xD;
folly.&#xD;
One morning, one of those who had been&#xD;
loudest in his threats, and had sneered most at&#xD;
the nightly cautions of Brion, was missed from&#xD;
camp. Believing that he would soon return, no&#xD;
uneasiness was felt on his account ; but not&#xD;
making his appearance, several of his friends&#xD;
started to look for him. After a short search,&#xD;
his lifeless body was fopnd a few rods from the&#xD;
encampment.   It had no wound-no sign of&#xD;
mortal injury visible to casual eyes ; yet the&#xD;
animating spirit had gone !  The thoughtless&#xD;
braggarts at first were shocked, supposing their&#xD;
comrade had met his death by violence; but dis-&#xD;
covering no external hurt, they changed their&#xD;
minds, and concluded he had died a natural&#xD;
death.-&#xD;
" What do you call a natural death ?" asked&#xD;
Buckeye.&#xD;
A young Missourian, by the name of Head-&#xD;
ley, replied, that he supposed apoplexy might&#xD;
be thus called.&#xD;
" If it's apoplexy, then apoplexy's a catchin'&#xD;
disease, and more'n one of ye'll be down with&#xD;
it afore you reach the trappin' grounds," said&#xD;
Buckeye, mysteriously.&#xD;
" You are not talking to boys, but to men 1"'&#xD;
retorted the Missourian, loftily.&#xD;
"I'm glad you've told me, for I shouldn't have&#xD;
mistrusted it," was the instant rejoinder.&#xD;
" It's plain enough to any one in his senses&#xD;
that this man died of a disease of the heart or&#xD;
brain. What else could kill him? I see no&#xD;
wounds or bruises, nor any signs of a struggle ;&#xD;
&#xD;
and you'll find it hard to crowd your mysteri-&#xD;
ous nonsense down our throats in the way you&#xD;
think."&#xD;
" Since you're so wise, it aint worth while to&#xD;
tell you anythin' more, because it -night hurt&#xD;
ye. I've knowed folks to be injured by know-&#xD;
in' too much.  An acquaintance of mine was&#xD;
'bliged to take to his bed jest on account of his&#xD;
gineral information," answered Buckeye, with&#xD;
quiet sarcasm.&#xD;
A grave was dog beneath a spreading poplar,&#xD;
in which the body was decently interred. The&#xD;
earth was smoothed, and a fire built over the&#xD;
spot, to prevent the resting-place of the mortal&#xD;
remains from being disturbed by the natives.&#xD;
During the day's march there was considerable&#xD;
discussion relative to the man's decease ; but&#xD;
Brion; Buckeye, and a few others, studiously&#xD;
avoided the topic. The latter had already ren-&#xD;
dered himself unpopular by the singular opin-&#xD;
ion he had advanced relative to the subject. He&#xD;
had lost among a certain class who had pre-&#xD;
viously been disposed to think highly of his&#xD;
wisdom and experience, that repute which lie&#xD;
hiad gained for shrewdness among them. They&#xD;
doubted his mental soundness, regarding him as&#xD;
weak and superstitious. Where before his pre-&#xD;
sence had been welcome, he was now met with&#xD;
coldness and ridicule. Sneers, covert jokes, and&#xD;
unfriendly innuendos, passed from uiouth to&#xD;
mouth at his expense.&#xD;
Such demonstrations the sturdy trapper did&#xD;
not deign to notice. He smoked his pipe calm-&#xD;
ly, conversed with the veterans of the brigade,&#xD;
praised the good qualities of Flash, and made&#xD;
occasional reconnoitering excursions in ad-&#xD;
vance. It was remarked by the more observing,&#xD;
that Brion was more' thoughtful and taciturn&#xD;
than usual. though they could very'naturally&#xD;
attibute the fact to the circumstance of the re-&#xD;
cent death.&#xD;
The next camp was chosen with particular&#xD;
care, and- unwonted precautions were had in&#xD;
setting a guard. The latter, two in number,-&#xD;
were relieved at midnight, when Headley&#xD;
and one of his friends took. their' places, with&#xD;
instructions to be vigilant. The Missourian&#xD;
heard Brion's orders with manifest impatience,&#xD;
and demanded to know if he supposed this&#xD;
was his first experience on the prairies of the&#xD;
Weit.&#xD;
" You may have had some experience in the&#xD;
border tow ns," said the mountaineer, mildly;&#xD;
" but you have not yet grown gray with the&#xD;
vicissitudes of a hunter's life. You're in a re-&#xD;
gion now where one hour is no type of what&#xD;
the next will be. - Things unexpected happen&#xD;
here. There are seventy-four of us, well, and&#xD;
in fighting condition ; but in the morning it&#xD;
isn' impossible that one may be missed from&#xD;
the lumber of his mess. I have known a band&#xD;
like this to be routed and scattered in a single&#xD;
night."&#xD;
&#xD;
The Missourian turned his back upon Brict&#xD;
and made no reply.&#xD;
The following morning proved cloudy an,&#xD;
dark, therefore favorable to repose ; a circus&#xD;
stance of which the weary adventurers availeu&#xD;
themselves by sleeping soundly to a later hour&#xD;
than they had been accustomed. Brion at&#xD;
length aroused them, and -the camp was soon&#xD;
astir with active preparations for cooking.&#xD;
Headley was found sleeping near the fire, and&#xD;
being awakened by the clatter around him, as.&#xD;
sure Buckeye, with a sinister smile, that he&#xD;
had escaped the disease, called apoplexy, in a&#xD;
wonderful manner. The former glanced quickly&#xD;
over the groups of men, replying that he hoped&#xD;
it had fared as well with his comrades., Some&#xD;
one said:&#xD;
" Let's ask him. Where is he ?"&#xD;
"Safe enough, I'll warrant," said Headley.&#xD;
Several voices called to the party referred to.&#xD;
At that moment Brion come up to the group&#xD;
with a very grave face.&#xD;
"Little good will it do to call him-he'll&#xD;
never answer to human call againI" he said, in&#xD;
a -low, measured tone.&#xD;
Every face was fixed on the partisan's in an&#xD;
instant.&#xD;
" Billy Minten is goneI" lie added.&#xD;
"Gone where 2" asked Headley.&#xD;
"Where we're all going, my men--to the&#xD;
great nation of the dead I" he answered, sadly.&#xD;
TheMiasourian's cheeks paled, while the bun-.&#xD;
ters and trappers gazed at each other in silence.&#xD;
"His body lies yonder; he fell at his post.&#xD;
And perhaps," he continued, looking steadily&#xD;
at Headley, "some of you can tell what he&#xD;
died of?"&#xD;
" A disease of the head or heart," muttered&#xD;
Buckeye, loud enough for Headley to hear '&#xD;
Brion's men now gathered about the remains&#xD;
of the unfortunate young man, seeking vainly&#xD;
for the wound that sped him hence. Evidently&#xD;
the had fallen where lie had last stood, stricken&#xD;
mortally, nor had moved a limb thereafter.&#xD;
His immortal part had been dismissed from his&#xD;
corporeal tabernacle without a struggle or pain-&#xD;
ful contortion. The face was as calta as if he&#xD;
slept; his lips were closed, as were the eyes-&#xD;
expressing no dread, or horror, or conscious-&#xD;
ness of suffering ; and the ghastliness of death&#xD;
was not written upon any of the features.&#xD;
When this spectacle first presented, an inter-&#xD;
val of silence followed ; which anon gave place&#xD;
to hurried queries no one could (or would) and&#xD;
swer. conjecture became rife, and speculation&#xD;
and hypothesis united to solve the mystery.&#xD;
Buckeye, Brion, and other veterans- in wood-&#xD;
craft, stood aloof. Headley, who made preten-&#xD;
sions to some knowledge of surgery, conducted&#xD;
the examination of the body, assisted by others&#xD;
of his sympathizers. Reluctantly h's relinquish-&#xD;
ed the search. Perfect obscurity covered the&#xD;
case; a truth he was loth to admit, for he&#xD;
prided himself on his perspicacity.&#xD;

" Well, sir, what are your conclusions ?- said&#xD;
the partisan, as Headley turned away, and passed&#xD;
where he was standing.&#xD;
'"There is nw evidence that he died of vio-&#xD;
lence--not the least. It is a puzzling case ; but&#xD;
his sudden decease must be attributed to some&#xD;
hereditary predisposition to-"&#xD;
A low laugh from Buckeye interrupted the&#xD;
speaker, and sent the blood to his face in a man-&#xD;
ner indicative.of considerable excitement.&#xD;
"Go on," said the partisan, quietly.&#xD;
"Not another word I" exclaimed Headley.&#xD;
"Upon some people common-sense is thrown&#xD;
away,.and sound reason, predicated on experi-&#xD;
ence, i$ just so much Greek. Superstition and&#xD;
ignorance go together, sir I"&#xD;
A slight smile curled Brion's lips for a mo-&#xD;
nment, while Buckeye stroked his long beard&#xD;
and shrugged his 'shoulders, according to his&#xD;
habit.&#xD;
" You decide, if I understand you, Mr. Head-.&#xD;
ley, that Minten died by some lurking disease,&#xD;
which came to a sudden and fatal crisis las&#xD;
night ?" resumed the partisan.&#xD;
The Missourian bowed stiffly.&#xD;
"You do not care to be explicit, I see ?.&#xD;
"Congestion of the brain, perhaps," replie'&#xD;
Headley, ill-humoredly.&#xD;
"Or.perhaps some diffikilty about the heart,&#xD;
replied Buck-ye, with affected humility.&#xD;
Headley dai'ted an angry look at the offender&#xD;
for nothing upset his mental equilibrium  s-&#xD;
quickly as doubting his knowledge, or ridicule&#xD;
ing his opinions He was specially infallible&#xD;
in his medical wisdom-his father having been&#xD;
a country doctor, with a large practice. To-&#xD;
ward Buckeye, within the last two days, he.&#xD;
had begun to entertain a positive dislike,&#xD;
which threatened to go on gathering strength&#xD;
until it became absolute, enmity and hatred.&#xD;
The trapper's matter. of-fact assu mption of sun&#xD;
perior skill in woodciaft had, in the first place,&#xD;
piqued hin' thanehis obstinate refusal to bow&#xD;
to his judgment in the incomprehensible cases&#xD;
of which we have been treating, completed his&#xD;
antipathy. As we have taken care to impress&#xD;
it upon the courteous reader, the younger and&#xD;
less experienced portion of the band sympa-&#xD;
thized with Hleadley, while only the veterans&#xD;
appeared to occupy neutral ground. Naturally&#xD;
superstitious, soie of the trappers were ready&#xD;
to believe that Heaven fiowned on their enter-&#xD;
prise, and was nanifesting its disapproval by&#xD;
the visitations of death. Gloom and discour-&#xD;
agement settled upon the countenances of such,&#xD;
nssl they resumed their march with a sullen-&#xD;
fleas that boded little good to Brion's schemes.,&#xD;

YE RANGER&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
TIIE UNKNOw Y OUTH AGAIN APPEARS.&#xD;
The party moved slowly on, Brion and Buck-&#xD;
eye remaining behind, with two men, to see the,&#xD;
body of Minten consigned to its kindred ele-&#xD;
ments, and all traces of the grave obliterated,&#xD;
to prevent its subsequent exhumation by savage&#xD;
hands. Thy simple bu;ial was soon coni-&#xD;
pleted. Buckeye was in the act of lighting&#xD;
the fagots that had been, heaped on the spot&#xD;
by the partisan's order, when a horseman was&#xD;
descried approaching at a gallop. his hurri.&#xD;
pace brought him-quickly to the side of tre&#xD;
mountaineer, who had observed his advane-&#xD;
with a curiosity that could not be disguised&#xD;
The rider was the slender youth who sought&#xD;
his lonely bivouac-fire on the baikc of the&#xD;
Kansas.&#xD;
Brion felt disposed to study the yomg et ra,&#xD;
ger closely. He noticed that hi chii -vr&#xD;
guiltless of beard ; his eyes larcae. viveciou&#xD;
and sparkling; his face dark, but comely. Al&#xD;
though clad, as has before been stated, in be&#xD;
fitting garb, his appearance wa- extreme'&#xD;
neat, and Brion thought a trifle foppisih. Thi&#xD;
idea Was sustained somewhat by the fact tha&#xD;
his feet and hands were small, the first encased&#xD;
in close-fitting moccasins, ornam-ted by In-&#xD;
dian skill; the-latter covered with gloves of&#xD;
soft leather, long enough to reach above the&#xD;
wrist, a third of the way to the elbow. His&#xD;
small, elegant rifle was fastened inmeniously to&#xD;
the saddle on the right side, in a maner to bt&#xD;
instantly available when wanted. A brace of'&#xD;
silver-mounted pistols peeped from holsters at&#xD;
the pommel, 'while the handle of a dagger&#xD;
flashed in the sun at his slight waist&#xD;
He sat on his horse with grace, and, there-&#xD;
fore, with ease.  And here we are brought&#xD;
naturally to speak of the qualities of the ani-&#xD;
mal that bore'the youthful rid, r  He was&#xD;
large and black as ebony, so that. the moun-&#xD;
taineer and trapper couldn't but admire his&#xD;
model proportions. Their attention was di-&#xD;
vided between the steed and his master; though&#xD;
too proud to confess, by outward manifesta-&#xD;
tion, how much they were interested and puz-&#xD;
zled, or, at least, not while the eyes of the&#xD;
youth were upon them.&#xD;
"Good morning, messieurs," he said, with&#xD;
an accent not purely American, yet clear end -&#xD;
distinct.&#xD;
"Yes, it is a very good morning, but I should&#xD;
like it better wore it less cloudy," answered&#xD;
&#xD;
.t&#xD;
t .&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BtCKE1&#xD;
the partisan, with more courtesf than on a&#xD;
former occasion.'&#xD;
- I suspect we ought to be pleased with&#xD;
everything Providence sends.; not to be so,&#xD;
seems like finding fault with one with whote&#xD;
dispensations we have no right to meddle,",was&#xD;
the' immediate rejoinder.&#xD;
" I confess, good youth, that your reasoning&#xD;
has the savor of truth. And I am now re-&#xD;
minded that I am probably under some obliga-&#xD;
tion to you. I found near me, on awakening&#xD;
the next morning after your visit, a dead ser-&#xD;
pent of a venomous kind, which was doubtless,&#xD;
slain by your hand," added Brion.&#xD;
"If that trifling act confers obligation, wh.&#xD;
you are right  The creature was about to d&#xD;
you an injury ; and, fortunately, it was in ml&#xD;
power to dispatch him before he fixed hr&#xD;
fangs."   I           '&#xD;
"For which service I am deeply indebted.&#xD;
If my reception was not at that time entire-&#xD;
ly cordial, and mingled with distrust, I trust&#xD;
to atone for the same when opportunity shall&#xD;
present."&#xD;
Brion spoke with some warmth, and bowed,&#xD;
quite low; for the youth, despite his slight fig-&#xD;
ure and smooth face, had an air that in some&#xD;
strange manner commanded respect.&#xD;
The stranger's horse a~that moment snuffed&#xD;
the air with affright, trembled, reared, and,&#xD;
made a sidelong bound.&#xD;
" Be quiet, Brave, be quiet. I see nothing to&#xD;
fear," said his master, soothingly.&#xD;
" We have just buried a comrade here ; it is&#xD;
the scent of death that terrifies him," said the&#xD;
partisan.&#xD;
The young rider colored, and backed Brav&#xD;
from the spot.&#xD;
"Did yon' friend find a natural death, or di(&#xD;
he die by Indian hostility ?" he inquired.&#xD;
" Indeed, sir, I will request my more expe-&#xD;
rienced crompanion to answer your question,,&#xD;
feeling confident that he will get nearer the&#xD;
truth."&#xD;
"It seems to me that the matter is very sim-&#xD;
ple. Certainly, the answer must be. yes or no;&#xD;
in which case one must be entirely right ortab-&#xD;
solutely wrong."&#xD;
"Ordinarily speakin', your ideas would be&#xD;
perfectlyto the pint; but in the partie'lar in-&#xD;
stance, you are wide the mark," said Buckeye.&#xD;
" The cap'n has been pleased to refer to nie ;&#xD;
but my opinion. I dare say, wouldn't be worth&#xD;
much to ye. If it wouldn't be takin' too&#xD;
much liberty, I'd like to 'ask if your friends&#xD;
are far from her ; for I take it you ain't alone,.&#xD;
seeing' you're young and inexperienced, as I&#xD;
may say ?"                               ,&#xD;
"I hope I have friends not far from me ; it&#xD;
would make me wretched to believe to the&#xD;
contrary," was the evasive reply.&#xD;
Prudential motives had clearly dictated&#xD;
Buckeye's query, and the youth appeared to&#xD;
comprehend his feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
YE RANGER.                             13&#xD;
"Being a stranger, you don't think it pru-&#xD;
dent to trust me ; is it not so ?"&#xD;
" Well, F had such a notion, I confess," said&#xD;
the trader.         '&#xD;
"AndI -am too youthful in appearance to&#xD;
invite confidence?  Come!d be true to your-&#xD;
self! Have I not traced the workings of your&#xD;
mind ?"&#xD;
"If you' never commit a greater blunder&#xD;
than that, you'll be a lucky lad," resumed&#xD;
Buckeye, with a characteristic motion of the&#xD;
shoulders. " But young heads," he added,&#xD;
" may be discreet, and a beard isn't allers ne-&#xD;
cessary to muke cne shrewd ; though judgin' by&#xD;
appearances, I should Daterally conclude -you&#xD;
ain't a veteran in woodcraft; and your frame&#xD;
is notcalculated to endure the hardships and&#xD;
fatigues of this kind of life. It isn't my busi&#xD;
ness, maybe, yet I'd advise ye, as a friend, to&#xD;
keep near your company."&#xD;
" I'm obliged to you for your good-will, and&#xD;
will endeavor to take care of myself," was the&#xD;
good-natured reply. "I see you about to&#xD;
move on. I will bear you company'at least&#xD;
for a time-to which proposal I trust you&#xD;
will have no objections," he added, in the same&#xD;
vein.&#xD;
Brion felt a strong desire to know his new&#xD;
friend's name, purpose, and destination; but,&#xD;
notwithstanding his situation was one to make&#xD;
such interrogatories proper, lie did not ap-&#xD;
proach'the subject without considerable em-&#xD;
barrassment, that could 'not have escaped the&#xD;
observing eyes of the stranger.&#xD;
"I presume," he began, " that the party to&#xD;
which you are attached seek these savage re-&#xD;
gions for the sake of excitement and novelty&#xD;
alone ?"&#xD;
" Your judgnient is good, my friend."&#xD;
The partisan, though dissatisfied with the re-&#xD;
ply, did not give up the pursuit.&#xD;
" Is your band large, sir ?" he resumed.&#xD;
6" Not very. I will remark, too, that their&#xD;
interest, I think, will not to any considerable&#xD;
extent conflict with yours., Be good enough to&#xD;
drop your suspicions, and permit me to see&#xD;
something of that generous confidence that I&#xD;
have heard distinguishes the roving trapper of&#xD;
the West. Had'I been your enemy, I should&#xD;
have permitted that ugly serpent to finish his&#xD;
work. Come, messieurs, tell me what caused&#xD;
the death of your comrade, whose grave is on&#xD;
the prairie, like a sailor's in the sea?"&#xD;
These words were spoken with an ingenuous&#xD;
frankness that, for the time being, dispelled&#xD;
distrust from the mind of the mountaineer.&#xD;
Looking at the lad's frank face, lie could not&#xD;
resist the convictions that his intentions were&#xD;
friendly, his mind void of hypocrisy.&#xD;
"Forgive my reserve, good youth,''said the&#xD;
pa-tisan, with unaffected earnestness, pausing,&#xD;
and extending his hand. "The life that 1 am&#xD;
at present following is ore to make me dis-&#xD;

satisfaction accompanied the youth's speech the speed of an eagle on the wing; makes a&#xD;
into Brion's ears, and the last lingering fray- swoop, strikes the pale-face with the shaft of&#xD;

his figure in the saddle, and seemed ten years can't be follered,-he can't be brought within the&#xD;

15&#xD;
&#xD;
and cunning savage;of great personal strength,&#xD;
who spends his life in avenging some real or&#xD;
fancied wrong. That his doings, are exaggera-&#xD;
ted, is very probable, and yet the being called&#xD;
Redpath is dangerous. You may consider him&#xD;
fabulous; you may even smile at my serious-&#xD;
ness, and pity my credulity."&#xD;
"And so you conclude Redpath slew your&#xD;
men?"&#xD;
There was a trifle of irony in the stranger's&#xD;
tones that did not escape Brion's notice.&#xD;
"I have not yet admitted that, I believe."&#xD;
" It was I who affirmed it," said, Buckeye.&#xD;
" One admission which you made, you have&#xD;
evidently forgotten ; you stated clearly that&#xD;
there were no marks of violence on the&#xD;
bodies ?"&#xD;
Buckeye was embarrassed by the cross-&#xD;
questioning of his new acquaintance; to gain&#xD;
time as well as to hide his momentary confu-&#xD;
sion, he helped himself to a generous quid of&#xD;
tobacco. Like most men, he was afraid of&#xD;
ridicule ; and that, in fact, was about the only&#xD;
thing he feared in the world.&#xD;
" I know it has a curious look at first, but a&#xD;
fact is a fact, and nothin' can change it. You&#xD;
see he has the, knack of doin' it in a strange&#xD;
way."&#xD;
"I should think so."&#xD;
" I reckon it won't make no great difference&#xD;
what you think 1" retorted Buckeye, drowning.&#xD;
"Not the slightest; but it is a very myste&#xD;
rious tale you have been telling, and you must&#xD;
pardon a little natural doubt on my part. If&#xD;
you scowl thus, I shall leave you."&#xD;
The trapper said to himself, " It won't be a&#xD;
great loss."&#xD;
"A story, after making the circuit of the&#xD;
Rocky Mountains, must necessarily be full&#xD;
grown when it gets here," the unknown added.&#xD;
" And I dare say you'll get to be a man&#xD;
when you have gone half that distance" Buck-&#xD;
eye rejoined, with a spice of sarcasm.&#xD;
It was now the youth's turn tobe confused ;&#xD;
he reddened to the eye-brows, while the trap.&#xD;
per congratulated himself on his lucky hit.&#xD;
"Be steady, Brave," said the youth ;, an ad.&#xD;
monition seemingly quite useless, as Brave was&#xD;
at that instant as docile as he could possibly be&#xD;
" To be killed," suddenly resumed the young&#xD;
man, rallying, "one must inevitably receive&#xD;
injuries of some kind-either wounds or bruises&#xD;
-something to leave tangible marks upon the&#xD;
person. Tell me, now, is there not some reason&#xD;
in this logic ?"&#xD;
"Oh, too much," replied Buckeye, sullenly&#xD;
"Pardon, sir," co tinued the other, addres&#xD;
sing Brion, "you have interested me ver3&#xD;
much in this wonderful relation. Really, do&#xD;
you believe in this savage vampire-this Gia&#xD;
Ben Gian of the prairies ?"&#xD;
"No more than what I am constrained to&#xD;
We may injure ourselves as much by believing&#xD;
too little as in believing too much. Dange&#xD;
&#xD;
that is,apprehended is, in a measure, guarded&#xD;
against. Though young in years, your intelli-&#xD;
gent face assures me that you understand the&#xD;
force of my last remark."             -&#xD;
"Do you fear this inexplicable enemy of the&#xD;
pale faces?"&#xD;
Whatever fault this question might have, it&#xD;
did not lack explicitness. The hot blood flew&#xD;
to Brion's face in an instant, and lie turned a&#xD;
proud, rebuking face upon the questioner.&#xD;
" Your extreme youthfulness," he said, with&#xD;
dignified severity, " induces me to overlook&#xD;
the-the-impertinence of your question."&#xD;
"I have offended."&#xD;
" And I have forgiven."&#xD;
" Thanks I"&#xD;
"Speak no more of it. I shall be cautious,&#xD;
but not cowardly. I hate cowardice-it is a&#xD;
species of meanness indicative of a pitiful&#xD;
spirit. Thus worthy trapper has spoken of&#xD;
Redpath-a personage either real or imagina-&#xD;
ry-and he has expressed hi opinion freely.&#xD;
Not so have I. If such an one exists, it is my&#xD;
fixed purpose to know more of 'him-to un-&#xD;
mask him-to discover if lie really pursues&#xD;
white men with the malignity and secrecy with&#xD;
which the tongue of mountain   rumor has&#xD;
charged him. I own that I have my doubts,&#xD;
and certain circumstances stagger and perplex&#xD;
me. My camp in future shall be on the alp-rt ;&#xD;
a prairie dog shall not be able to pass it un-&#xD;
seen. Our enemies shall know what it is to&#xD;
outwit a veteran mountaineer."&#xD;
Buckeye glanced at the partisan with an air&#xD;
of pride and satisfaction ; it pleased him to re-&#xD;
flect that such a brave, well spoken man was a&#xD;
brother trapper. "He cried : "iHi, hi!" to&#xD;
Flash, causing lnim to shoot ahead of his com-&#xD;
panions like an Jarrow.  Brave laid his ears&#xD;
back, offended that another animal should have&#xD;
the audacity to pass him.  Buckeye's exhila-&#xD;
ration soon expended itself, and lie allowed&#xD;
Brion to come up with him.&#xD;
" Your horse has excellent qualities, I'm&#xD;
sure," the young man remarked, as Buckeye&#xD;
resumed his former place.&#xD;
S   " He hasn't no equal between this and the&#xD;
s Pacific, I reckon-no superior, sartin I"&#xD;
.   " Sagacious and intelligent, without doubt.&#xD;
You call him Flash on account of his speed,&#xD;
e perhaps ?"&#xD;
 ." Jest for that reason, mister, and no other&#xD;
e. He isn't so fat and sleek as some boss-ilesh&#xD;
n I've seen; but, when there's need, I know&#xD;
pretty near where to find him. Flash has a&#xD;
few titicks, too, that I've learned lhim, e'en&#xD;
- most human."&#xD;
y    Bri n glanced at the stranger youth at that&#xD;
o moment, and perceived that he was looking at&#xD;
n the hatchet that he had taken from the tree in&#xD;
the manner described. and which he had car-&#xD;

THE BUCKEYE.RANGER:&#xD;
&#xD;
and instantly turned his attention another way&#xD;
The mountaineer was sagacious, and quick to&#xD;
observe, and the circumstance, slight as it was,&#xD;
did not pass unnoted. A train of novel ideas&#xD;
began thereupon to whirl through his brain ;&#xD;
he seemed trying to work out some kind of a,&#xD;
problem, without being able to find the proper&#xD;
data from which to start. Buckeye contrived&#xD;
to touch him o  the arm, giving him a warn-&#xD;
ing look, that said : " Cap'n, I'm very sus-&#xD;
picious of this little feller."&#xD;
But a change had come over the partisan-&#xD;
the signs of the trapper were unheeded ; he&#xD;
rode on, singularly taciturn arid reflective.&#xD;
"Look, comrade, there's a horseman away&#xD;
yonder,-and he's making signals !" exclaimed,&#xD;
Buckeye, pointing toward the mountains.&#xD;
kI thank you for your company, brave&#xD;
knights of the rifle and trap. Adieu, mes-&#xD;
sieurs, adieu I"&#xD;
With a neigh of joy, Brave recognized the&#xD;
signal togo, and sprang a.way with a force&#xD;
that nade the ground tremble.&#xD;
"A spy I" cried the trapper, vehemently.&#xD;
"Say but the word, eap'n, and, I'll fowler and&#xD;
bring the voting scamp back !"&#xD;
" Do no such thing 1" said Brion, earnestly.&#xD;
" And what you propose is impracticable.&#xD;
See bow he rides! ,Alt, my friend, you might&#xD;
as well chase the wind l"&#xD;
Buckeye gazed after the black horse and:&#xD;
&#xD;
his rider with both vexation and admiration-..&#xD;
vexed he hardly knew for what, and admiring'&#xD;
because of the swiftness of the steed. He&#xD;
shook his wise head dubiously, wondering htow&#xD;
such a silken sort of'lad got so far front home,&#xD;
and what he was-good for. Small bands and&#xD;
feet, a slight framte, neatly-fitting garments, a&#xD;
smooth and comely face, were irreconcilable&#xD;
with his notions of woodcraft.&#xD;
" I have a secret," lie said, at length.&#xD;
" Well ?"&#xD;
"It is worth knowing' "&#xD;
" I should like to hear it."&#xD;
"But to-day I won't tell you. Do you&#xD;
know it isn't a lucky day to tell a secret? You&#xD;
don't, of course-I see it by your expression."&#xD;
"You excite .my curiosity, much, When&#xD;
shall I have your confidence ?"&#xD;
" To-morrow, like enough ; we shall see.&#xD;
But here is the rear of your lazy. fellows, and&#xD;
the very first man of them is that conceited&#xD;
coxcomb, leadley ! I can't tolerate him, so&#xD;
I'll leave you ; but I'll stroll into your-eamp&#xD;
before the moon is vop to-night."' 1,&#xD;
The trapper urged Flash to a gallop, and&#xD;
bounded along the almost interminable reach&#xD;
of prairie. His stout figure was soon but a&#xD;
mere-speck between the plain and the horizon,&#xD;
still growing less and less to the eyes that fol.&#xD;
lowed him.&#xD;
&#xD;

IN wHICH BELLMAR AND MARIOT APPEAR.,&#xD;
It is needful that we make a ,retrogade move-&#xD;
ment, that tie next advance in the line of march&#xD;
of our story miaty be more orderly and intelli&#xD;
gible to those so obliging as to follow us in our&#xD;
rovintrs in the distant West.&#xD;
Atmbrose Bellniar and Pierre Mariot were&#xD;
residents of Westport. and partners'in the fur&#xD;
traie, annually sending forth a brigade of trap.&#xD;
pers. Te first was an elderly man, the father&#xD;
of a dItiairtet rwho had attained to seventeen-&#xD;
year.  as -well as to a degree of beauty exceed-&#xD;
ittgly rare, save in the pages of romance.&#xD;
Pipere Maiot was the soli of Jules Mariot,&#xD;
Motsieur Delhnar's late partner, deceased.&#xD;
The young itnan- had been admitted to the&#xD;
house of  Belliar and Mariot," partly on ac-&#xD;
countit f the frier dshIip that Bellnar had enter-&#xD;
tained for htis father, and partly because he&#xD;
did not wish the latter's funds withdrawn&#xD;
from the enterprise at .a time when there was&#xD;
a heat y pressure in the money-market. M.&#xD;
Beilrmar iight have had Other schemes in his&#xD;
mtind, of which we may presently speak.&#xD;
Pierre entered keenly into the rivalry of the&#xD;
trade,, wit fewer conscientious scruples than&#xD;
his predecessor.  To the senior partner's&#xD;
credit be it written, that he had more of that&#xD;
which .men term principle, than the junior;&#xD;
but Mr Bellmnar, or Monsieur Bellmar-for he&#xD;
was a Frenchman-was avaricious, possessed&#xD;
of a restless, insatiate spirit of gain, which led&#xD;
hint on step by step, encouraged by Pierre, to&#xD;
runny actstlhat lie feared would trouble tim&#xD;
on his death-hed. The new fur company had&#xD;
injred his business ; there had been a per-&#xD;
ceptible decline in his income since its organ.&#xD;
ization. Such a state of things alarmed his&#xD;
cupidity, stimulating him to devise means to&#xD;
check rmate his competitors, and turn the stream&#xD;
o ' ,old once more into his coffers. Strategy&#xD;
he had always encouraged and rewarded, when&#xD;
successful among his employes ; but, since&#xD;
the new association had secured the services of&#xD;
Ben Brion is leader of the trapping operations,&#xD;
lie was, aware .that ordinary art would fail;&#xD;
tliereforje, something out of the common order&#xD;
must I e done, or the trade would languish,&#xD;
and he, perhaps, be driven, ultimately, entirely&#xD;
from the field that he had occupied so long,&#xD;
Vnid gleaned his wealth from.. Pierre Mariot,&#xD;
who hal also heard the note of warning which&#xD;
this arrangement had sounded, gave evidence&#xD;
tht lie would set himself at work in earnest.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mignon-Bellmar's daughter-was one day&#xD;
in the library, amusing herself, as she  as&#xD;
wont, with her good companions, the books.&#xD;
She heard her father approaching, accom-&#xD;
paried by Iariot, whose voice always admon.&#xD;
fished her of his proximity. There was a small&#xD;
apartment beyond, and into that Mignon went,&#xD;
closing the door. ' By the time she was seated,&#xD;
ready to resume her reading, Bellmar and&#xD;
Pierre reached the library. Madenmoiselle Mig-&#xD;
non observed that something very unusual&#xD;
took place, viz.: Mariot shut the door and&#xD;
locked it, after which she heard him draw a&#xD;
chair near the writing-desk where her father&#xD;
invariably sat. . Mignon did not like her posi-&#xD;
tion. She was forced to be a listener, pro&#xD;
vided they conversed in their natural tones,&#xD;
there being no mode of egress save through&#xD;
the apartment taken possession of.&#xD;
"You are aware, Monsieur Bellmar, that&#xD;
this confounded fur company, that has given&#xD;
us -so much uneasiness, has engaged Ben Brion&#xD;
for its leader? Brion, you will remember, is&#xD;
the man whose services we tried to secure ?"&#xD;
"Yes-the disagreeable news has reached&#xD;
me. I perceive that our business will sustain&#xD;
a severer check than ever, Monsieur Mariot."&#xD;
"Can you doubt it? Something must be&#xD;
'done," said Pierre.&#xD;
" Ma foi! we have not ceased to do some-&#xD;
thing ever since these unlucky rival companies&#xD;
existed. What new expedient remains ?"&#xD;
That is a point to be settled by us, and&#xD;
without delay."&#xD;
"Ai, my friend, common strategy will not&#xD;
do with Ben Brion."&#xD;
" Who knows that better than I? It is for&#xD;
that very reason that we must take measures&#xD;
bold and energetic."&#xD;
M. Bellmar mused.&#xD;
" We are quite alone, I suppose ?" Mariot&#xD;
added.&#xD;
Mignon, who sat directly opposite the key..&#xD;
hole of the door, was now listening with eager&#xD;
interest, and without a single feeling of com-&#xD;
punction.&#xD;
" Entirely alone," replied Bellmar.&#xD;
"We must ruin the American Fur Com&#xD;
pany'!" with emphasis on the word "ruin."&#xD;
"Be good enough to tell me how ? My strat-.&#xD;
egical resources are exhausted."&#xD;
" We must break up and disorganize the&#xD;
party under Brion."&#xD;

is to be accomplished."&#xD;
"By means that may perchance startle&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
Mignon shuddered, knowing that something&#xD;
terrible was in Mariot's mind; she knew by&#xD;
the tines of his voice.&#xD;
" We must keep the penalties of the law in&#xD;
view."quoth Bellmar, wriggling in his chair.&#xD;
" Law does not reach beyond Fort Leaven-&#xD;
worth.  We will employ instruments that&#xD;
laugh at the word law."&#xD;
" Indians?"&#xD;
Mit.non made a slight movement.&#xD;
" Wlkat was that ?" asked Pierre.&#xD;
. "Nothing; go on ; you would, you say, em-&#xD;
ploy savages-at least, you mean so to be&#xD;
understood ?"&#xD;
" Yes; our enemies-they who take from&#xD;
me my business, are my enemies-must be&#xD;
awed, shocked, stunned, scattered, the surviv-&#xD;
ors driven from the trapping-grounds like&#xD;
trembling sheep."&#xD;
Mariot pronounced these words with start-&#xD;
ling energy, stamping angrily upon the floor.&#xD;
" There is much evil in that man,".thought&#xD;
Mignon.,&#xD;
" Proceed," said the senior.&#xD;
" I have told you all."&#xD;
" Foudre!" exclaimed Bellmar, impatiently.&#xD;
" You have told me nothing I"t&#xD;
" Leave the ways and means to me, and you1&#xD;
will have naught to regret."F&#xD;
Monsieur Bellmar rose and paced the floor.&#xD;
" I shrink from acts of hostility," he added.]&#xD;
"I shrink from losing my invested capital,"1&#xD;
retorted Maritt, in a hard, dry tone, in which&#xD;
self was uppermost.f&#xD;
"Such things lie heavy on one's conscience(&#xD;
as one grows old, Pierre," retorted Bellmar, in t&#xD;
a deprecating way.&#xD;
"It would grieve me to be obliged to with-e&#xD;
draw my capital, and dissolve the old and re-a&#xD;
spectable house of Beilmar and Mariot." '-&#xD;
" It would be a sad blow to a man of my&#xD;
years, wanting, as I do, your youthfulness and&#xD;
energy."                                 .&#xD;
" Will you abondon this to me?"I&#xD;
" Nous verrons !"&#xD;
"Delay will baffle my purpose ; accede at,&#xD;
once.".Tt&#xD;
"You will send agents ?" -t&#xD;
Doubtless."&#xD;
" Perhaps go yourself?"n&#xD;
"It is possible."&#xD;
" And it will cost?"     ~)&#xD;
"'A thousand ,dollars."&#xD;
OSo much ?"'                            o&#xD;
"The benefits will be tenfold. That com-&#xD;
pany annihilated, we go on agaia as in old&#xD;
times. when my father lived."-            't&#xD;
" What do you propose in relation to s&#xD;
Brion ?"                                  n&#xD;
"Pardon, monsieur, but I will not worry j t&#xD;
you with details. You consent ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" You will be careful of human life? Blood&#xD;
on your conscience will prove a burden."&#xD;
"Do not be uneasy. I.will play nmy hand&#xD;
skillfully ; but remember that I do not promise&#xD;
to do mischief!"&#xD;
" Well, Mariot, be discreet, and spend money&#xD;
to advantage.' By-the-way, I have received a&#xD;
letter front our Indian agent, Fournier, which&#xD;
I will show you. It is in my pocket-no, it&#xD;
is in a coat that I took off yesterday. I will&#xD;
go for it."&#xD;
" Bellmar is getting into his dotage; he is too&#xD;
weak, too weak 14 muttered Mariot, the mo-&#xD;
ment the senior left the room. " He wishes&#xD;
for a plan of the campaign, but I am not so&#xD;
stupid as to show my order of battle ; it&#xD;
would strike him dumb, his nerves are so&#xD;
shattered."&#xD;
" Ah i" said Mignon to herself, " you do not&#xD;
know who heard that remark."&#xD;
" Once in receipt of my plan, he would soon&#xD;
betray all to Mignon. Mignon is timid, and&#xD;
her conscience is as sensitive to evil as inereury&#xD;
to the changes of temperature."&#xD;
" Astute Pierre Mariot!" thought Madcmois.&#xD;
elle Bellmar.&#xD;
The senior returned with the letter, which&#xD;
treated, in the main, of affairs of no interest to&#xD;
the reader ; in it, however, occurred this curi-&#xD;
ous passage: " The trappers and hunters,&#xD;
who are daily arriving at the trad img house,&#xD;
have much to say about that mysterious per-&#xD;
sonage whom I referred to in a former letter.&#xD;
He is supposed, by many, to be a celebrated&#xD;
Blackfoot chief, that bears mortal enmity to all&#xD;
whose faces are white. Would it not be lucky&#xD;
if he should cross the trail of the new company,&#xD;
and give them a taste of his quality ? I am&#xD;
endeavoring to cultivate friendly relations with&#xD;
the Blackfeet, with a fair prospect of success.&#xD;
I think it wotld be well to send out a fresh&#xD;
stock of Indian finery by your next brigade,&#xD;
such as glass beads, ribbons, pipes. Also, a&#xD;
ot of hunting-knives and cheap guns. But do&#xD;
not be too sanguine about the L'lnckfeet-they&#xD;
are a wily, cruel, intractable race in every par-&#xD;
ticular, differing from their neighbors, the Nez&#xD;
Perces, who are a harmless, honest people, on&#xD;
whom we can -rely in all pertaining to legiti-&#xD;
mate trade, but who cannot easily be induced&#xD;
to act against other companies in turning the&#xD;
ide- of traffic to our interest "&#xD;
"Do you know much of this redoubtable&#xD;
native to which Fournier alludes ?" Mariot in-&#xD;
quired, with an earnestness that he regretted a&#xD;
moment after.&#xD;
" By common camp-gossip only; a species&#xD;
of information not very reliable, friend Pierre,"&#xD;
was the response.&#xD;
"Is he not a being purely of the imagina-&#xD;

" It may be thus ; but itis scarcely probable.&#xD;
Mountaineers are shrewd, and the American&#xD;
free-trapper has sense, and always understands&#xD;
what he's about."&#xD;
"Do the Americans also talk of Redpath ?"&#xD;
" Yes, mon ani. I conversed with one Buck-&#xD;
eye, a genuine type of the free-trapper class,&#xD;
that has a firm belief in such a personage."&#xD;
" Well, there is 'nothing marvellous in the&#xD;
fact that an Indian chief should be revengeful&#xD;
-spurred on, as he may be, by a burning sense&#xD;
of -wrong."&#xD;
"It is not that which excites alarm; it is&#xD;

"You speak earnestly, Monsieur Bellmar."&#xD;
" Not earnestly, but to the point."&#xD;
And then the senior added :&#xD;
"Our rivals are making strong efforts to fill&#xD;
up their brigade. They will soon be ready for&#xD;
the Western trail."&#xD;
"I must be three weeks in advance of them ;&#xD;
that is; my agent must. I will dog them with&#xD;

"Go on, sir."&#xD;
"As-as shall greatly surprise them," he re-&#xD;
sumed, in a voice much modified, and with a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
" This is a quiet place to make confidential&#xD;
arrangements," he continued, looking about&#xD;
him with a satisfied air. " I may wish to be&#xD;

mutual interests. It is getting late-I must&#xD;
meet an appointment."&#xD;
The parties arose and left the library, while&#xD;
Mignon remained in her chair, like' one very.&#xD;
much startled and confounded. S'he had satis-&#xD;
fled herself long before that Pierre Mariot was&#xD;
a man of a low standard of morality, but she&#xD;
was not prepared to believe him so much a vil-&#xD;
lain as he had proved himself. He was medi-&#xD;
tiLing crime-scheming the ruin of others-&#xD;
planning deeds of blood--drawing rer father&#xD;
into the vortex of his evil mind.' Ali! Mariot,&#xD;
your last virtue and your .last chance faded&#xD;
from the heart of Mignon that'morning. She&#xD;
scorned, he despised you. when you. left the&#xD;
house, full of dark devices for the overthrow of&#xD;
your brother man !&#xD;
Mignon went to the window, the only one in&#xD;
the room, and which fronted the street. 'The&#xD;
sash was raised a little.. .Maiot and her father&#xD;
had reached thie hall door, and the former was&#xD;
upon the steps, wvhen she heard him remark:-&#xD;
" Here comes Brion !"'&#xD;
Mademoiselle Bellmar cast her eyes down the&#xD;
street, lie saw a man on hoi'sehack.' He was&#xD;
mounted on a stout, bay animal that carried,&#xD;
himself proudly, like a trained horse on parade.&#xD;
&#xD;
YE RANGER.                            ' 19&#xD;
Th(y p  entation was striking, calculated to&#xD;
impress one with the majesty of the human&#xD;
figure, the noblestrength and spirit of the horse,&#xD;
and the dignity of both were gracefully united.&#xD;
" How noble!" exclaimed Mignon, euthusi-&#xD;
g tically, then blushing at her warmth, she&#xD;
drew back.&#xD;
Brion sat firmly and erect, his stalwart pro.&#xD;
portions seeming a portion of hisglorious steed,&#xD;
his left hand grasping the rein, his right at rest&#xD;
by his side, his face a-glow, his bold eyes full&#xD;
of animation&#xD;
" A fine picture. Oh, Pierre Mariot, if you&#xD;
could only look like that I" soliloquized Mignon.&#xD;
"But that is impossible; only a noble nature&#xD;
can look noble."&#xD;
" He reminds one of the gallant caaliers of&#xD;
the old school," she heard her father say.&#xD;
Brion was' now opposite the house; lhe raised&#xD;
his eyes to the window and saw Mignon She&#xD;
was charming ; and the gaze he thus unwilling-&#xD;
ly surprised, thrilled him, and made him blush&#xD;
like a school-girl convicted of a misdemeanor,&#xD;
Familiarity with Nature in her simplest and&#xD;
yet grandest form of development had not&#xD;
blunted Brion's susceptibility to those delight-&#xD;
ful emotions which the presence of a lovely&#xD;
woman inspires. For a second, an appreciative&#xD;
space of time to the soul-the mountaineer was&#xD;
dazzled, and at a loss; then he recovered his&#xD;
self-possession, and bowed like a Knight Tem-&#xD;
pier&#xD;
Mignon ran from the window in a strange&#xD;
flutter of excitement, and the sound of latter.&#xD;
ing hoofs followed her to her chamber,&#xD;
0 Mignon ['lost and won ina single day!&#xD;
Three individuals.answering'to the appella&#xD;
tives of Grenier, Kincaid, and Gardette, were&#xD;
seated upon a bench not far from the establish-&#xD;
ment of Bellmar &amp;amp; Mariot.  The first was a&#xD;
German, the second a Frenchman, the third a&#xD;
half-breed. Grenier was despairing, Kincaid&#xD;
angry, Gardette sullen, and all were hungry.&#xD;
They belonged to the lazier, less efficient, and&#xD;
most unscrupulous of the mountaineers. Their&#xD;
present possessions were meagre, having noth-&#xD;
ing about them but bad reputations. which they&#xD;
had richly earned, and were -in a fair way to&#xD;
keep. They had offered their services to vari-&#xD;
ous fur companies without success, their char-&#xD;
acters for good-for-nothings being pretty ex.&#xD;
tensively known and appreciated.&#xD;
The three unworthies had been about West.&#xD;
port, more or less drunken for the last three&#xD;
weeks, during which time they had created a&#xD;
feeling of universal dislike, not unfrequently in&#xD;
suiting the wives and daughters of respectable&#xD;
citizens, besides committing various thefts&#xD;
to gain the means, probably, of continuing&#xD;
their debauch. Their resources, as well as&#xD;
the patience of the inhabitants, were at length&#xD;
exhausted ; they were warned to leave the place&#xD;
within four-and-twenty hours, under the dire&#xD;

penalty of a coat of tar and feathers-a gar-&#xD;
mnent dreaded alike by every class of the genus&#xD;
homo. The short period of grace allowed them&#xD;
would expire in', the morning; .but there were&#xD;
serious obstacles in the way of their departure.&#xD;
Let it be understood that they had no horses,&#xD;
go arms, nor anything like a proper outfit for&#xD;
the mountains.  They could have dispensed&#xD;
with the first, had they been provided with the&#xD;
second ; but guns and ammunition were essen-&#xD;
tial' necessities, without which they would&#xD;
starve upon the trail. They realized the dilem-&#xD;
ma into which they had fallen, and were com-&#xD;
bining their remaining wits to surmount the'&#xD;
difficulties that beset them. Various projects&#xD;
had been discussed, but all in turn rejected,&#xD;
either as impracticable, or unadapted to the&#xD;
emergency ; hence their gloomy visages.&#xD;
"Monsieur Mariot comes this way," said Kin-&#xD;
caid, whose anger-inflamed eyes chanced to be&#xD;
turned to the storehouse of Bellmar &amp;amp; Mariot.&#xD;
" Let him come," retorted Gienier, in a mel-&#xD;
ancholy tone.&#xD;
" Let us hold a knife to his throat till he hire&#xD;
usi," proposed the former.&#xD;
" That's a fool's advice!l" affirmed Grenier.&#xD;
" You're always grumbling I" quoth Kin-&#xD;
caid.&#xD;
"Let us go to the Indians !" said Gardette.&#xD;
" And have our'scalpstaken of," added Kin-&#xD;
caid, spitefully.&#xD;
" Be still. Mariot has something to.say to us.&#xD;
I know by the way he looks and walks," said&#xD;
Grenier.&#xD;
Pierre Mariot approached the trio with a mien&#xD;
so guarded that it was impossible for the par-&#xD;
ties to divine whether his coming boded good&#xD;
or evil.&#xD;
"Well, messieurs, when do you start for the&#xD;
mountains ?" he asked.&#xD;
Grenier held his tongue ; the half-breed turned&#xD;
his back to the questioner, and Kincaid said, in&#xD;
a defiant voice :  -&#xD;
" When we get ready, monsieur 1"&#xD;
" Al, I see! you're waiting for an outfit,'l re-&#xD;
turned Mariot, in a tone that at once reminded&#xD;
Kincaid oftthe tar and feathers in reserve ; he&#xD;
clenched his fist, and scowled ominously.&#xD;
" You'll do well to keep your jests at home"&#xD;
be gruffly retortrd -&#xD;
"You are iii execrable temper, my good fel-&#xD;
low. What will you wager that I will not make&#xD;

Kinceid perversely.&#xD;
- Be reasonua'e, and don't destroy the only&#xD;

again. if I will "&#xD;
"We tried yo, aind you refused us-hiring&#xD;
green hands in irefe rence ; that is why Iadvise&#xD;
you to leave us."&#xD;
" But if I have changed my mind?"&#xD;
" Why, then, speak out, and we'll hear you."&#xD;
&#xD;
" You are acquainted with the country?"&#xD;
"I know every yard of it from here 'to Co.&#xD;
lumbia River. Have starved in the Wind&#xD;
River Range, feasted at the Yellow Stone. frozen&#xD;
on the Salmon Mountain, and thawed at Walla-&#xD;
Walla. So have my comrades,", asserted the&#xD;
Frenchman, confidently.&#xD;
"Are you on friendly fb ting with many of&#xD;
the Indian tribes ?"&#xD;
" With nearly all of then."&#xD;
"And can speak their language, I suppose?"&#xD;
" As well'as my mother tongue."&#xD;
"I want men who combine shrewdness, ener-&#xD;
gy, and courage, with-other qualities."&#xD;
" We have all the qualities you want, mon-&#xD;
sieur," said Kincaid, modestly.&#xD;
"I wish you to act as my agents. I shall&#xD;
pay you liberally, providing you enter into my&#xD;
service with zeal."&#xD;
" Agents, Monsieur Mariot!" exclaimed Gre-&#xD;
nier.&#xD;
"Agents in reality, if not openly. You know&#xD;
thereare rival bands in the field*?"&#xD;
" I get a little light, monsieur."&#xD;
" I shall supply you with horses and all that&#xD;
you need. This is no place to give you instruc-&#xD;
tions, neither is our office ; therefore you will&#xD;
meet me at Bellmar's, where we can talk con-&#xD;
fidently, for you must know that this is a mat-&#xD;
ter of great importance and secrecy."&#xD;
" We'll be there, but our engagements won't&#xD;
admit of much delay, monsieur," said Kincaid,&#xD;
with a knowing leer.&#xD;
"I am aware of it!" Mariot answered,.with&#xD;
a smile. " And now promise me that if I pay&#xD;
you a few dollars in advance, you will not go&#xD;
and get so drunk that you will not be able to&#xD;
comprehend what you will be required to lo."&#xD;
"Oh, sir, as if that were possible !" said Gre-&#xD;
ner, innocently, casting at the same moment&#xD;
a meaning glance at his associates.&#xD;
" You are trusty as steel itself, I've no doubt;&#xD;
so here is what will put different faces on you."&#xD;
" That has the complexion of silver, I really&#xD;
believe, said Kincaid.&#xD;
Mariot having said all that lie deemed of any&#xD;
consequence, left the mountaineers to reflect on&#xD;
the happy turn of circumstances,&#xD;
"You may be sure something wicked is to be'&#xD;
done," said the Frenchman, the moment Pierre&#xD;
was out of hearing.&#xD;
"Cunning and bad," quoth Gardette.&#xD;
" Our consciences are tender," Kincaid added,&#xD;
with mock  anctimoniousness.&#xD;
" And obliging to a weakness," said Grenier&#xD;
"Therefore should be strengthened by inter-&#xD;
nal applications. Come, mounrtaineers, renem-&#xD;
ber, we are to act civilly and morally, and&#xD;
not make brutes 6f ourselves. Only think that&#xD;
Mariot could for one instant imagine we should&#xD;
get drunk !. Foudre ! were ever men so wrong.&#xD;

. CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
MARIOT MEETS WITH DISAPPOINTMENT.&#xD;
It was nearly dark.- Mignon was returning&#xD;
home from a long walk. She had chosen an&#xD;
unfrequented path that she might reflect with-&#xD;
out interruption, having much to think of seri-&#xD;
ously. She found herseli placed in an awkward&#xD;
position in regard to Pierre Mariot, and it was&#xD;
of that she was meditating. Voices and bois-&#xD;
terous laughter reached her ears, assuring her&#xD;
that persons were near; indeed, two men were&#xD;
already in sight, and presently a third joined&#xD;
them. Mignon would gladly have evaded them&#xD;
had it been possible ; but that was out of the&#xD;
question, there being no other road, and they&#xD;
close at hard. She went forward urn.,d.itating-&#xD;
ly, with what resolution she could command, not&#xD;
even raising her eyes to the faces of the ill-man-&#xD;
nered trio, one of whom placed himself so as to&#xD;
obstruct the way. Rude jests assailed Mignon;&#xD;
she was alarmed.&#xD;
aIf the people of the town threaten us, to&#xD;
repay them we will insult their daughters," said&#xD;
one, staggering toward Mademoiselle Bellmar.&#xD;
"'Tis no more than just," cried a second.&#xD;
"Hush, she is pale-she will faint!" added&#xD;
the third, sneeringly.     -&#xD;
"1Oh, how delicate you are, miss. And what&#xD;
pretty goods you wear ! Dear me, not so fast,&#xD;
now ; you will deprive us of your company too&#xD;
soon," resumed he who had first spoken, in the&#xD;
slow, thick utterance of a drunken man.&#xD;
" Oh, you are a great deal better than poor&#xD;
fellows like us. But it is such as we who make&#xD;
your townsmen rich, and we get for it only&#xD;
threats and bad words."&#xD;
Mignon recoiled with a cry of terror, for one&#xD;
of the villains had the insolence to grasp her&#xD;
arm, employing language that made her cheeks&#xD;
redden with shame and indignation. , She- had&#xD;
the presence of mind to cry for assistance ; and&#xD;
it came promptly and resolutely. A man whose&#xD;
eyes seemed to emit lightning, scattered the in-&#xD;
sulters, and supported Mignon. His presence&#xD;
was a Gibraltar of strength to Mignon-there&#xD;
was sach noble determination in his face, such&#xD;
manliness in his shapely figure. She recognized&#xD;
the horseman who had ridden so gallantly--&#xD;
Ben Brion, the mountaineer, whose.name had&#xD;
been mentioned by Mariot.&#xD;
Mademoisellewas so pretty, so engaging in&#xD;
&#xD;
her deportafent, so graceful and warm in til&#xD;
expression of her gratitude, that the parns&#xD;
sighed when he left her, regretting that hsctia.l-&#xD;
ing would so soon take hin from We': p.rt-&#xD;
from the vicinage of the only woman who it&#xD;
ever qeuickened the pulsations of his io1, at&#xD;
hen et.&#xD;
Pierre Mariot had a long conver-at:on with&#xD;
Grenier, Kincaid, and Gardette, at the time ap-&#xD;
pointed. Miss Bellmar was as punctual as he,&#xD;
believing it not an act of meamifess to hear the&#xD;
development ofa nefarious scheme for te ijitry&#xD;
of those pursuing a lawful and honorable busi-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
It would not be edifying to the reader to state&#xD;
all that was said in-detail ; a few of the most&#xD;
important points will be touched u pon.&#xD;
" I think you told me," 'messieurs mountain-&#xD;
eers," said Pierre, graciously, "that your --u-&#xD;
gagement would compel you to leave Westport&#xD;
at an early hour to-day ?"&#xD;
" We have but an hour-s grace, monsieur ; and&#xD;
then the canaille of this accursed place will (1r&#xD;
upon us," replied Kincaid, who acted as spokes.&#xD;
man for his comrades.&#xD;
"Not the canaille alone, worthy hunter; for&#xD;
the more respectable townsmen are much exus-&#xD;
perated at your free-and-easy manners. I fear&#xD;
you have acted scandalously, but that is no&#xD;
business of mine ; it deranges my plans a little,&#xD;
but-I can get along. Nov, we will to the mat-&#xD;
ter in hand.  J hope you are sober enough to&#xD;
comprehend ?"&#xD;
Mariot assumed a different tone and bearing;&#xD;
he spoke firmly, determinedly, and rapidly,&#xD;
keeping his keenly penetrating eyes tixed stetaa-&#xD;
ily upon his listeners.&#xD;
" I want men that 'can act discreetly-not&#xD;
those who can only get drunk and act the brag-&#xD;
gart and -brawler. If I employ you, and pay&#xD;
you, you must-do my bidding to the letter, and&#xD;
without useless questioning. I know that you&#xD;
are not scrupulous. Beep silent; if you&#xD;
were honest men, you' would not do for me ;&#xD;
and if you flatter yourselves that you are such,&#xD;
you have only to walk out of the house ; for in&#xD;
that case our negotiations will stop at once. I&#xD;
want subtle-"&#xD;
" Oh monsieur, I trust you were not going to&#xD;
say knaves !" interrupted Kineaid.&#xD;
* Three subtle fellows, willing to earn their&#xD;
money according to the wishes of their employ.&#xD;
er. Now, hear my plan. - You are to start this&#xD;
very day, for I wish you to be some weeks in&#xD;

"He is said to be a Blackfoot I"&#xD;
"Yes," responded-Kincaid.&#xD;
"And the Blackfeet--"&#xD;

Pierre Mariot slipped some money into the&#xD;

"But you will see if the thing can be done ?"&#xD;
Gardette nodded.&#xD;
" Let it be so understood ; and if you are&#xD;

were softened by sipiles of aifeeted gaiety-lie&#xD;
studied to assume his most agreeable phases&#xD;
and phrases. His playfulness might have been&#xD;
amusing had it been sincere. Mignon permitred&#xD;

"In view of our approaching marriage," he&#xD;

" I was going to observe, that in view of our&#xD;
approaching marriage-"'&#xD;
"&amp;amp;Marriage, Monsieur Mariot ? Did you not&#xD;
say marriage ?"&#xD;
" That air was charmingly put on, Mignon I&#xD;
Yes, I said the word you have repeated with so&#xD;
much emphasis.",&#xD;
"Please allow me to inquire to what parties&#xD;
the word 'our' is intended to apply ?"&#xD;
" To your charming self and your humble&#xD;
servant, Pierre Mariot," the returned, bowing..&#xD;
" That is news indeed I How facetious you&#xD;
are to-day. I have not.seen you so amusing for&#xD;
a long time."&#xD;
"It is you who are facetious. it seems to me,&#xD;
Mademoiselle Bellmnar. Your father and I con-&#xD;
versed seriously on this subjectlast night ; he&#xD;
&#xD;
agrees with me that farther procrastination is&#xD;
unnecessary. You are aware that it was the&#xD;
intention of our parents that we should be&#xD;
united when of a proper age. Such a compact&#xD;
was made when we were but children. I think&#xD;
my attentions to you have been of a character&#xD;
not to be misunderstood. I believed that my&#xD;
advances were received as they were intended ;&#xD;
that your own sympathies as wellas the wishes&#xD;
of your father were in my favor, leading you&#xD;
naturally to expect that the day of our union&#xD;
must be near at hand ; it has often been referred&#xD;
to by me in your hearing, as an event long cal-&#xD;
cilated upon."&#xD;
."Monsieur 1Mariot, I know nothing of a mar-&#xD;
riage to take place between you and I," said&#xD;
Mignon, calmly.&#xD;
"Mignon, you jest with such a serious air&#xD;
that you alarm me !" exclaimed Pierre, turning&#xD;
very pale.&#xD;
""Be assured there will be no marriage be-&#xD;
tween us," she added, in the same tone.&#xD;
.  You positively alarm rue. Your manner&#xD;
is really chilling. Do you mean to be under.&#xD;
stood that all is at end between us ?"&#xD;
" I simply mean to say that I shall never&#xD;
marry you, Monsieur Mariot."&#xD;
"Mademoiselle Bellmar ?"&#xD;
Am I sufficiently plain in my speech to b&#xD;
apprehended ?"&#xD;
" You are cruelly plain if you are in earnest,"&#xD;
he replied.&#xD;
"I never was, and never expect to bemore in&#xD;
earnest than at this moment. You are to re-&#xD;
ceive this decision as final."&#xD;
"'Oh,I cannot believe this-it is too unex-&#xD;
pected," cried Mariot, in a hoarse voice.&#xD;
"Your vanity led you to expect nothing but&#xD;
success. You were always vain, Pierre Mariot.J&#xD;
ut, thank Heaven ! I have never offered in-I&#xD;
cense to your vanity."l&#xD;
Mariot's phale cheeks flushed when MignonI&#xD;
poke of his vanity ; the shaft went home. ,&#xD;
I must go to your father. I must know theI&#xD;
meaning of this I will beg of him to bring you&#xD;
to reason."&#xD;
"Is it my father that you wish to marry,&#xD;
anonsieur, or his daughter ?"&#xD;
"Mignon, you are killing me !"&#xD;
"The gifted and the good dig young."&#xD;
"What bitterness, Mademo'iselle Bellmar.t&#xD;
Will you not regret this? .I may lose pa- t&#xD;
tience, and remorse may visit you when it is&#xD;
too late."l&#xD;
' .our vanity spoke then ; but do not trou- 1&#xD;
le yourself, I beg of you. When I repent my I&#xD;
present decision, I shall better apprehend your p&#xD;
mtenae  You vish to insinuate that I shall&#xD;
sustain a great loss. Believe ne, now, I am  h&#xD;
perfectly resigned to it !" she rejoined. i&#xD;
SWhat will your worthy father say when he b&#xD;
knows your determination ? Mignon, spare s&#xD;
him such grief, this union has been the dream s&#xD;
ifhb. ifel"                            t&#xD;
&#xD;
" Are you then such a desirable son-in-la&#xD;
Mariot felt himself demolished and prostrat-&#xD;
ed. His pride was in ruins, but his anger%&#xD;
streamed like fire above the wreck. He was&#xD;
astounded and at a-loss. He knew not whether&#xD;
to retreat or go forward, his fair enemy had&#xD;
taken him so much by surprise.&#xD;
" Go, Monsieur Mariot, and forget me. There&#xD;
is no possibility that my feelings will change.&#xD;
I refuse you for the best reason in the world.&#xD;
I do not like you. Would you wed a woman&#xD;
who makes this confession ?"&#xD;
"You are jealous, perhaps ?" said Mariot,&#xD;

" There is your unpardonable vanity again.&#xD;
Lovers only-are jealous, and I cannot in the&#xD;
nature of things be jealous of a man whose pre-&#xD;
sence is irksome. It is time this interview&#xD;
ended. I wish you happiness with one more&#xD;
like you in heart. Adieu, sir."&#xD;
Mademoiselle Mignon arose, bowed ceremo-&#xD;
niously, that is coldly, and left Mariot alone,&#xD;
who, a floment later, was heard hurrying&#xD;
through the hall to the street.&#xD;
A month after the events just recorded, at&#xD;
the close of a day which had been uncommon-&#xD;
ly-fine, a man on.horseback approached a suc-&#xD;
cession of rugged hills and defiles in the vicin-&#xD;
age of those extensive prairies lying along the&#xD;
Nebraska River for many miles, the favorite&#xD;
hunting-grounds of the dreaded Blackfeet. It&#xD;
would have puzzled a hunter, even, to have&#xD;
determined whether the horseman was a white&#xD;
man or an Indian. Indeed, lie could not well&#xD;
merit the term white, his rough features being&#xD;
mueh burned by the vehement suns ,of the&#xD;
p rairies. There was nothing very notable about&#xD;
his appearance. His horse was a strong, tough&#xD;
nag, chosen more for his powers of endurance&#xD;
than for speed or beauty; while the rider and&#xD;
his belongings filled up the picture of a free-&#xD;
trapper, very well provided for the practice of&#xD;
his vocation.&#xD;
le proceeded moderately, and with much&#xD;
circumspection, as if conscious that he was in&#xD;
a situation requiring constant vigilance. Soon&#xD;
he entered a valley almost destittite of vegeta-&#xD;

ident step, though retaining his watchful de-&#xD;

THE BUCKEYE RANGER.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
&#xD;
NEW MISPOaTUNES BEFALL BBION'S DAND.&#xD;
&#xD;
It has been stated that Brion observed that&#xD;
the youthful adventurer - who has twice&#xD;
passed before the reader's imagination-had&#xD;
glanced with some degree of interest at the&#xD;
.hatchet that he found so singularly. Falling&#xD;
again in the rear of his band, after Buckeye's&#xD;
departure, lie examined the weapon more par-&#xD;
ticularly. It was' small, and finished with&#xD;
scrupulous neatness, smooth as the surface of&#xD;
a mirror. It seemed to have but one defect--'&#xD;
the handle did not appear-sufficiently tight ;&#xD;
and while noticing the fact, he discovered a&#xD;
piece of paper between the same and the. eye&#xD;
into which it was fitted. With the point of his&#xD;
knife he drew out the paper, and was astonish-&#xD;
ed to find there was writing upon it, which he&#xD;
hastened to read.&#xD;
" du are closely and perseveringly watched by those&#xD;
who seek the ruin of your enterprise, and who will not&#xD;
hesitate to employ. the most exceptionable reans to&#xD;
insure their purpose., Be wary, if you would escape&#xD;
dangers pre:'ssng and imminent, and plots the most&#xD;
cunningly devised "                      - ,&#xD;
- This is extraordinary," exclaimed Brion,&#xD;
when he had read the foregoing lines. ' I am&#xD;
closely watched, and am exhorted to be warp.&#xD;
Who wrote these words of warning? I would&#xD;
give six months' salary to know; they are&#xD;
traced with a pencil, and by a practiced hand,&#xD;
too. A plot ! What does that mean? , It re-&#xD;
fers to a rival company, clearly. Let me see:&#xD;
This was written a week ago, andI have been'&#xD;
so stupid as not to discover it. Twb deaths&#xD;
have occurred since that time-one last night,&#xD;
one time night before. But this is a strange way&#xD;
of comitiutieating intelligence, and uncertain,&#xD;
withal ; for, had I not discovered the hatchet,&#xD;
it might have remained there; and the paper&#xD;
with it, so all this good-will would have been&#xD;
lost  Who will say that the prairies have not&#xD;
their bit of rntauce ?  But who comes?: A&#xD;
stu aigeIr, a white titan, a hunter."&#xD;
The mttan wno excited the last remark, urged&#xD;
his horse to a gallop as he drew near; in a few&#xD;
uititutes he was by Brion's side. The partisan,&#xD;
while atecting to regard his approach with in-&#xD;
differene, ,r as a common-place affair, was&#xD;
really studying his features closely, trying to&#xD;
recall when and under what circumstances he&#xD;
&#xD;
had met him before; for it seemed to him that&#xD;
this was not their first meeting. Having de-&#xD;
scribed others' of his calling, we have no in-&#xD;
clination to inflict useless' items of dress and&#xD;
outfit, while his person anc bearing presented&#xD;
nothing very remarkable. His face was not&#xD;
easy to read, but might hate passed very well&#xD;
for an honest one, market neither by genius&#xD;
nor uncommon tact. He saluted Brion famuili-&#xD;
arly, who returned his salutation with civility.&#xD;
The latter'swish was to know whether the&#xD;
new-comer was in the employ of a rival com-&#xD;
pany ; it was a natural desire. He approached&#xD;
the subject with caution, and his meaning,&#xD;
without declaring it- directly, was quickly un-&#xD;
derstood.&#xD;
" My name," said the trapper, "is Dorelle,&#xD;
and my business you can easily guess."&#xD;
" Yes," said Brion.&#xD;
-" To relieve you from any suspicions that&#xD;
you may feel, I will inform you that I am not&#xD;
in the employ of any fur ;company, nor at-&#xD;
tached to a brigade of trappers."&#xD;
"A free-trapper ?"&#xD;
" Thank fortune, yes. I want my liberty. I&#xD;
should not feel lil     ' -.a man if I we'e under an-&#xD;
other's control. Give me the mountains and&#xD;
prairies, and lakes and rivers, with nothing but&#xD;
my horse and my own will to guide me, and I&#xD;
am  happy.  Human authority galls me, or&#xD;
rather would gall me, were 1to submit to it&#xD;
Oh! I never could be a slave after having&#xD;
breathed the air of freedom in a country reach-&#xD;
ing from sea to sea, and provided by nature&#xD;
witf enough tc supply the simple necessities of&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"You discourse like one to the wilderness&#xD;
born and bred," said the partisan.&#xD;
" That is true. I was born on the border,&#xD;
and have been a rover since a boy. The ways&#xD;
of civilized life in great cities, and busy towns,&#xD;
do not please such as I. The noise of machin-&#xD;
ery, the smoke of crowded habitations, and the.&#xD;
artificialities 'of modern usages, repel me, and&#xD;
make- me nore in love with my manner of&#xD;
life," added Dorelle.&#xD;
" Where have I heard that voice ?" queried&#xD;
Brion. "Have you crossed any Indian trail ?,&#xD;
he asked. -&#xD;
"Yes, of a large body."&#xD;
"Of what nation ?"&#xD;
" The most hostile and most dangerous-the&#xD;
Blackfoot."&#xD;
" Which way did the trail tend I"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Off in that direction to our left."&#xD;
" Consequently, to avoid them-."&#xD;
"You must keep close to the mountains on&#xD;
the right."&#xD;
The partisan did not immediately reply ; he&#xD;
refl-eted.&#xD;
" That would seem like rushing into danger.&#xD;
The Blaclgffet are wont to lie in wait in yon-&#xD;
der defiles at the base of the mountains," he&#xD;
remarked, at length, in a careless tone.&#xD;
"I know it; but it would appear from the&#xD;
direction of the trail, that they have changed&#xD;
their tactics "&#xD;
"That is a very reasonable conclusion,"&#xD;
quoth Brion. " To-morrow, I must thinkabout&#xD;
changing our course."&#xD;
"It would be prudent; but a man of expe-&#xD;
rience like you, needs no advice."&#xD;
" Here are my ne ," said the partisan, as&#xD;
they came up with the rear of that band.&#xD;
" Make yourself at hom~ne wvith them."&#xD;
With these words le spurred forward, and&#xD;
was soon in advance of the foremost of the&#xD;
party, mounting every eminence; crossing&#xD;
every brook, and examining the ground where&#xD;
it was soft enough to, yield to the pressure of&#xD;
human feet.&#xD;
While thus actively engaged in reconnoiter-&#xD;
ing, his thoughts were not wholly engrossed&#xD;
with his employment; they wandered back to&#xD;
Westport, to linger about the spot where he&#xD;
had seen Mignon. The clattering of horses' feet&#xD;
recalled his mind to the rough region of reality&#xD;
where his corporeal substance was.&#xD;
"You see we have overtaken you, captain,"&#xD;
said a voice.&#xD;
Brion raised his eyes, and perceived several&#xD;
of the more thoughtless young, men of his&#xD;
band, of whom Headley was the leading spirit.&#xD;
"This is imprudent," exclaimed Brion, very&#xD;
sharply. "You had orders not to leave the&#xD;
main body."&#xD;
" And why is it imprudent?" asked Headley,&#xD;
haughtily, for he liked not the tone of com-&#xD;
mand which the partisan assumed.&#xD;
"It is imprudent, in the first place, because&#xD;
you had my orders to remain with the brigade;-&#xD;
and in the next, for'the reason that a party of&#xD;
Blackfeet are lurking in the vicinity," said the&#xD;
mountaineer, firmly.&#xD;
"Oh, is that all ?" exclaimed Hleadley, with&#xD;
a derisive laugh, in which his companions&#xD;
joined&#xD;
"That is sufficient ; I order you to return&#xD;
instantly," rejoined Brion, with a dignified and'&#xD;
authoritative air.&#xD;
f' Are we then under martial discipline ?"&#xD;
asked Headley, angrily.-I&#xD;
"You are under my orders, and when I&#xD;
abuse my power, there will be time enough to&#xD;
rebel. It is my duty to use my authority when&#xD;
the general safety is concerned; therefore, go&#xD;
back."&#xD;
Three of the refractory spirits reluctantly&#xD;
&#xD;
turned, and sullenly rode toward the brigile,&#xD;
which was about two miles in the reir, wile&#xD;
Headley and two others obstinately kept "un,&#xD;
disregarding orders.&#xD;
"Men, you will regret -this!" exclainied&#xD;
Brion, in a voice free from anger or harshness,&#xD;
yet decided, and full of meaning.&#xD;
" We will see, we will see!"'retorted Head-&#xD;
ley, biting his nether lip with vexation.&#xD;
The partisan's frank and manly face grew&#xD;
cloudy.&#xD;
" These green hands," he muttered to him.&#xD;
,self, " will bring misfortune upon our enter-&#xD;
prise. And I an responsible for all that hap-&#xD;
pens. I was a fool to accept this post, but I&#xD;
will be obeyed !"&#xD;
The mountaineer continued his investiga-&#xD;
tions several hours, with all that tact and skill&#xD;
experience had taught him. He was thus bu-&#xD;
sied, when he was joined by Buckeye, whose&#xD;
presence, at that moment, was desirable, a~s&#xD;
Brion felt the need of a friend on w hom he&#xD;
could rely. They rode on side by side, the&#xD;
latter relating what had passed between him&#xD;
and Headley.&#xD;
" There he is, yonder. waiting for the band&#xD;
to come up," said Buckeye.&#xD;
" And a few yards before him is one of his&#xD;
foolhardy companions."&#xD;
The partisan and Buckeye soon reached the&#xD;
spot where IHeadley was sitting.&#xD;
" Where are your friends ?"&#xD;
" If you have eyes, you will iseaone of them,&#xD;
yonder, seated on a rock," he replied.&#xD;
" And the other ?"&#xD;
"Is still farther ahead, on the other side of&#xD;
the ridge."&#xD;
" Very well; you may consider youself&#xD;
dismissed from the employment of the Auwrt-&#xD;
can Fur Company, Mr. Headley. From this&#xD;
moment, you are at liberty to go where you&#xD;
please."&#xD;
" What do you say ?" cried Headley, disa-&#xD;
greeably astonished.&#xD;
Brion made no answer. and,.riding ,on, re-&#xD;
peated the same words to the next man, who&#xD;
attempted to stammer forth excuses, which the&#xD;
partisan did not wait to hear. When he&#xD;
reached the top of the ridge spoken of by&#xD;
Headley, he looked for the third transgressor,&#xD;
whose-name was Stringer, but Stringer was not&#xD;
visible.&#xD;
Buckeye hurried forward, and descended the&#xD;
slope at a gallop. Before ten minutes had&#xD;
elapsed, he called to Brion to come on as fast&#xD;
as possible. Alarmed by the peculiar, tones of&#xD;
Buckeye's voice, the mountaineer struck the&#xD;
spurs into his horse and dashed down the&#xD;
ridge. He found the trapper leaning over the&#xD;
pommel of his saddle, with pale cheeks and&#xD;
dilated eyes. Upon the ground, at the fore~&#xD;
feet of Flash, was stretched the unfortunate&#xD;
Stringer-he was lying on his back, the blood&#xD;
had receded from his face, his lips were white,&#xD;

&#xD;
and he was gasping in the last extremity.&#xD;
Brion sprang from his horse, but the man was&#xD;
dead before he reached him.&#xD;
The mountaineers gazed at the corpse, with&#xD;
feelings of indescribable awe. There was&#xD;
something crushing in the thought that a man!&#xD;
who, a moment since, was full of life and&#xD;
youthful fire, was now but a clod-powerless,&#xD;
inert.&#xD;
Cpime in what form he will, death takes men&#xD;

ness and mystery, when mortals have no inti-&#xD;
mation of his approach, taking' one whose life&#xD;
seems good for many years, and he is doubly&#xD;
feared.&#xD;
Brion and Buckeye were still contemplating&#xD;
the yet warm body, when Headley and his&#xD;
comrade came up -they had heard the trap-&#xD;
per's call to Brion, and were suspicious that&#xD;
something strange 'had occurred.  Drawing&#xD;
near, with downcast, anxious looks, they be-&#xD;
held the spectacle that kept the tongues of the&#xD;
mountaineers mute. Headley was astounded ;&#xD;
his visage grew as pallid as the ashy features&#xD;
of Stringer. He allowed the bridle rein to fall&#xD;
from his grasp, and, with glassy eyes and&#xD;
parted lips, stared at the stiffening body of him&#xD;
who, a few minutes ago, was riding gaily at&#xD;
his side. An inexplicable dread fastened upon&#xD;
his heart-an indefinable trembling seized his&#xD;
limbs. He seemed to-see an unknown danger&#xD;
approachingein circles that every instant less-&#xD;
ened their diameter. In tl  ghastly face of&#xD;
Stringer he fancied he saw his own fate. Like,&#xD;
him he should be stricken by an unknown dart,&#xD;
and like him be gazed at by eyes dilated by&#xD;
terror; like him be buried on the prairies, and&#xD;
left to eternal solitude. I-&#xD;
Birion gave him a reproachful look'-a look&#xD;
which accused him of being an accessory to his&#xD;
comrade's death.&#xD;
"Do you see this ?'' said the partisan, when&#xD;
the silence had become oppressive.&#xD;
leadley made an affirmative'sign.&#xD;
"And do you remember that I warned you&#xD;
of the danger of leaving the party ?" continued&#xD;
the captain, with cold severity.&#xD;
The Missourian sat motionless in his saddle.&#xD;
"You claim some knowledge of surgery. Do&#xD;
you wish to examine this body?" resumed&#xD;
3rion.&#xD;
Headley shook his head like one who wishes&#xD;
to say : "I have had enough of-that; it is of&#xD;
no use."&#xD;
Buckeye was sitting calmly upon his horse ;&#xD;
he now darted a meaning glance at Headley,&#xD;
from under his heavy brows. It needed noin-&#xD;
terpreter; lie understood its signification per-&#xD;
fectly. It asked him if he was satisfied-if lie&#xD;
believed there were others who knew as much&#xD;
as lie did.&#xD;
"iHave you an explanation to offer ?" added&#xD;
the partisan.&#xD;
&#xD;
" No," replied Headley, "I have nothing to&#xD;
say.       ..&#xD;
- ' Not so with me," said Buckeye. "I have&#xD;
a few words to say, which' may, perhaps, make&#xD;
our wise friend from Missouri a trifle wiser-if&#xD;
that's possible. I'm pretty sartain that my&#xD;
opinion on many pints isnt worih a chare of&#xD;
powder; but what I know, I'm sureof. Now,&#xD;
sir (looking at Headley), if you want to discover&#xD;
whether Stninger died of a disease of the head&#xD;
or heart, you shall be gratified."&#xD;
Then addressing Brion :&#xD;
"I said I had a secret to tell you to-morro-v;&#xD;
but, seeeing what's happened. I won't keep it&#xD;
any longer, for there'll never be a better time."&#xD;
To Headley again:&#xD;
"Now, sir, examine Stringer's.head.".&#xD;
The Missourian dismounted, and, resting one&#xD;
knee on the ground, lifted Stringer's head, and&#xD;
holding it with the palna Qf his left'hand, seru&#xD;
tinized it closely.&#xD;
"I see nothing,"l he affirmed.&#xD;
"Part the hair, just above his right ear, and&#xD;
you will find the head of a steel arrow driven&#xD;
through the skull,,into the brain," said Buck-&#xD;
eye.*     !"   1'dHa&#xD;
"It is so I" exclaimed Headley.&#xD;
"And yet theredis no blood to indicate a&#xD;
mortal wound," said Brion.&#xD;
" The hair is saturated very little under-&#xD;
neath, next the skin," replied Headley; "but&#xD;
the fact that there is no hemorrhage is easily&#xD;
accounted for. The arrow-head is not much&#xD;
larger than a lady's bodkin, and makes but a&#xD;
mere puncture in the skin; being driven with&#xD;
great force, it penetrates deeply into the brain,&#xD;
causing instant paralysis of all the vital func-&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
"T hat certainly seems to be an arrow-head,"&#xD;
said Headleys friend, "but where is the&#xD;
shaft ?"&#xD;
" Look once more," added Buckeye.&#xD;
Headley passed the point of a penknife into&#xD;
the scarcely perceptible wound, feeling care-&#xD;
fully over the steel surface.&#xD;
" It may be so contrived," he said, when ne&#xD;
had reflected a moment, " that the shaft could&#xD;
be detached, after driving the point to its fatal&#xD;
destination."&#xD;
" Or broken off1" suggested Headley's friend.&#xD;
"And the shaft - what becomes of that ?"&#xD;
queried Brion, looking at Buckeye.&#xD;
" One thing's sartaic; it isn't to be seen in&#xD;
this case, and it was so in the other, too ; so&#xD;
we can form what opinion appears most nat'-&#xD;
ral. I dare say the eunnin' reptile as did this,&#xD;
broke off the shaft and carried it away, as an&#xD;
act of bravado, as well as to mystify, and make&#xD;
things look unace'ountable."&#xD;
"I will see if he comes and goes without a&#xD;
trail," said Brion, throwing the bridle-rein) to&#xD;
Buckeye.&#xD;
" Remain just where you are, men, that no&#xD;
new track may be made," he added, commene-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing a Wej'a .l(eestigation of the ground, which&#xD;
,ioDtinneu until the entire party came up. The&#xD;
tbrecisct, hearing what had happened, commu-&#xD;
s  ated it to those next to them, and the news&#xD;
ral quickly from mouth to mouth, until all were&#xD;
:n possession of it. While those in the rear&#xD;
were pressing to the scene of the catastroS be,&#xD;
the partisan tpiproacIed Buckeye, and sai , in&#xD;
a low tone:&#xD;
"I wish you to watch the stranger who&#xD;
joined us to-day, Keep your eyes on him when&#xD;
he looks at Stringer's body, and is hearing the&#xD;
circumstances that attended his death."&#xD;
The trapper made a si n that lie' would do&#xD;
so  Dorehle was in no hurry, being the last to&#xD;
approach the corpse. When he beheld the&#xD;
white and rigid face, he shuddered and drew&#xD;
back, as if the sjuctacle had been more shock-&#xD;
ing than hle had-anticipated. Buckeye observed&#xD;
him closely while the story of the steel arrow.&#xD;
as being told by those who had first reached&#xD;
the spot. That it produced in his mind feel-&#xD;
ings of unfeigned astonishment, the trapper did&#xD;
not doubt---his demeanor attesting it in every&#xD;
natural way.1&#xD;
There was now ample subject for conversa-&#xD;
ion among the trappers -young and old con-&#xD;
fessing the same interest, the same awe. Stringer&#xD;
,.as buried as his companions had been, the.&#xD;
niountain-ers resumtitig their long and weary&#xD;
man'h with saddened hearts and cloudedfaces,&#xD;
potn I a  darkly on the fate of Stringer, ask-&#xD;
tig wIose turn would come next, each mutu-&#xD;
aity ,aying : - It may be me."&#xD;
iilidl-y, on whom  the incident of the day&#xD;
had made a deep impression, rode up to Brion,&#xD;
the nioment ha opportunity offered when he&#xD;
could address him alone.&#xD;
. I owe you an apology, captain," he said,&#xD;
fr m  fu'ly, and I hope you will be disposed&#xD;
to overlook what has passed. I acknowledge&#xD;
ti;t I in rited reproach, and the deatn of&#xD;
Si iiongi r is a rebuke that will cause me sorrow&#xD;
so loig as I live.'"&#xD;
" I restore you to your place, Mr. Headley,&#xD;
aond a( or friend, too, and will:attribute your&#xD;
cond'uet to tho ughtlessness, rather- than obsti-&#xD;
naey," replied the partizan, with that frankness&#xD;
that clha racerizd limin.--&#xD;
ieadoley thanked him, and hastened to inform&#xD;
his refraciory companion of the result of his&#xD;
apology.&#xD;
Linin or-1ered a halt in the afternoon, for&#xD;
the purpose of hunting the buffalo, having&#xD;
killed but one since leaving Fort Laramie. A&#xD;
few of tt host skillful hunters were sent out,&#xD;
the reminiuider of the hand being strictly en-&#xD;
igiined to keep within certain preoiiicts ; apin-&#xD;
jimet.ion.i that the leader had no difficulty i en-&#xD;
forcing, such a dread of their mysterious enemy&#xD;
had fallen on them. The hunt not pi-oving sue-&#xD;
cesfuh, it was resolved to continue it during&#xD;
-the next day ; therefore their encampment was&#xD;
&#xD;
made to assume a more permament appear-&#xD;
ance. Being in a dangerous neighborhood, a&#xD;
corral was .built for the horses, and various&#xD;
precautionary measures were taken.&#xD;
As the night drew on, Brion observed that&#xD;
many of the men grew anxious, even some of&#xD;
the veterans, so much had the fate of Stringer&#xD;
affected them. Within the corral, which war&#xD;
considerably large, a smaller inclosure was&#xD;
made, by placing the trunks of cotton-woods&#xD;
horizontally on the ground, one upon the&#xD;
other, until they reached as high as the breast&#xD;
of a man of ordinary height. Behind that&#xD;
shelter they hoped to escape the skill of their&#xD;
inexplicable adversary. We must, however,&#xD;
except the partisan and Buckeye from the num-&#xD;
ber who entertained the idea of passing the&#xD;
night behind such a shelter. They had either&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
k' Look," said be to Buckeye, "tthe sun is&#xD;
sinking majestiially upon the prairies ; it is art&#xD;
easy to dispel the illusion that it will not rest&#xD;
on this mighty level, instead of passing to ano-&#xD;
ther hemisphere, to illuminate other iortals--&#xD;
to shine on other cities and peoples, iountains.&#xD;
lakes, and rivers."&#xD;
" That was my own thought," replied the&#xD;
other ; " but it would have been morally imit-&#xD;
possible for a rough old feller like ate to ex-&#xD;
press it in such a way. Human cretirs may&#xD;
be constituted pretty near alike, cap'n, as to&#xD;
the real man, but we'havn't all the same fakilty&#xD;
of expression. Nov that naturally reminds me&#xD;
of death, when the sun of life seems to be going&#xD;
down into the airth, so to speak, to he buried,&#xD;
and extinguished forever.  To all appear-&#xD;
ance, what there is of such as you and I cease&#xD;
to be, is put into the ground to be compounded&#xD;
ag'in with the eternal elements, to play its part&#xD;
ii other forms, till time shall- be no longer.&#xD;
But, cap'n, there may be suthin' that rises like&#xD;
the sun, like it to shine forever in another re-&#xD;
gion."&#xD;
" God knovs how fervently I hope so !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Brion. "To believe that Stringer has&#xD;
a consciousness, at this moment, like yours and&#xD;
mine-as full, as perfect - would abiost con-&#xD;
sole one for his death ; nay, it would quite !"&#xD;
"Poor Stringer !" sighed Buckeye.&#xD;
"I don't know whether to say poor Stringer.&#xD;
or not !" said Brion, impressively, looking tip&#xD;
solemnly into the cloudless sky. "By heavens!&#xD;
lie may be better off at this instant t'hai yen or&#xD;
I. I sometimes wish that the arrow of Red.&#xD;
path might enter my own brain, and thus dis-&#xD;
miss me from care and pain "&#xD;
"Pain and care Iwhat pain and care should&#xD;
one like you have, cap'n ? Perhaps you lost&#xD;
your heart at Westport ?" rejoined Buckeye.&#xD;
The partisan blushed - an assertion that&#xD;
nay,- perhaps, appear well nigh incredible to&#xD;
the reader ; but it has been proved, number-&#xD;
less times, that the man who can face a bat&#xD;

,ar absence of wounds in the two first cases&#xD;

of similar visitations that experience and pru-&#xD;
dence can devise ; but it is a humiliating thought&#xD;
that seventy men are forced to extraordinary&#xD;
measures for protection against a single savage&#xD;
arm; it shames me, Buckeye, and makes me&#xD;
doubt that I have passed ten years in the&#xD;
mountains, where dangers are thick, and skill&#xD;
is indispensable. If I do not put a stop to this,&#xD;
the name of Ben Brion will cease to be quoted&#xD;

what I can make of him. If I discover mis-&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
&#xD;
GOILD-BUNTING IS TALKED OP.&#xD;
&#xD;
Evening came. The hunters and trappers&#xD;
were gathered about the camp-fires in groups,&#xD;
cooking their supper, discussing the ll-engross.&#xD;
ing subject of the day. Each in turn gave his&#xD;
opinion, razarded a conjecture, or recited some,&#xD;
startling tale of Inditm cunning and cruelty.&#xD;
The young men of the band had less tosay than&#xD;
usual ; their ardor was cooled ; they fervently&#xD;
wished themselves within the pale of civiliza-&#xD;
tion again, no longer finding fault at :he lack&#xD;
of incident that attended their march.  The&#xD;
faces of Stringer, Minten, and Townsend were&#xD;
constantly before then. reviving and 'keeping&#xD;
vivid the mystery of their death, the awful sud-&#xD;
denness of their departure.&#xD;
" It would appear," said Headley, "that we&#xD;
are destined to fall by the wayside, one at a&#xD;
time. We shall mar'k each day's journey by a&#xD;
grave."&#xD;
'That is true," responded a young man by&#xD;
the name of Conroy, who but two days before&#xD;
had coinplined of the monotony of their jour-&#xD;
ney, and its paucity of adventure.&#xD;
I wonder," resumed Ieadley, as if talking&#xD;
to himself, " if we were hired' for the purpose,&#xD;
of being shot in the head with a steel arrow ?"&#xD;
The query, though addressed to no one in&#xD;
particular, caught like a train of powder, just&#xD;
as it was intended.. The short but expressive&#xD;
monosyllable " No," made the circuit of tike&#xD;
group in an instant.&#xD;
"That is my own opinion," added Headley.&#xD;
"I have from the firstentertained the idea that&#xD;
our services were engaged to trap and hunt ?"&#xD;
"In course," said Conroy, sullenly.&#xD;
"But it's too late now, I suppose, to save&#xD;
ourselves. Seeing we must all succumb to the&#xD;
foul fiend that clogs usgooner or later, I expect&#xD;
we must make the best of it. It would be well,&#xD;
however, to suggest to the captain to dig a&#xD;
grave every night, so that our march won't be&#xD;
delayed in .the morning. We could then look&#xD;
in each other's faces and seem to realize that&#xD;
one of us is actually tremnbling on the boundary&#xD;
of the other world."&#xD;
"6God save me from such a realization for&#xD;
&#xD;
many a year!" e.eiaitnai C(or coy, glancing&#xD;
around uneasily.&#xD;
" Oh, it is an ey deatr '" added ller.dley,&#xD;
adroitly, knowing wtell hc-sa to excite the fears&#xD;
of his comrades.&#xD;
"If you covet such a fate, seek it ; but it fills&#xD;
me with unspeakable dread !" cried Conroy,&#xD;
with a shudder.&#xD;
" It is so sudden, tlrrat one has no chance to&#xD;
repent," said Dorolle, who had joined the&#xD;
group.   The young trappers looked encourn-&#xD;
gingly at-their new ally.-&#xD;
"I wWh we could change our route, so as to&#xD;
leave this accursed traill" protested Ileadley,&#xD;
with increasing boldness.&#xD;
I had thought,' added Dorelle, artfully,&#xD;
that you were one of the partners, and not an&#xD;
employee ?"&#xD;
" Oh, no, sir. I'm under the o lers of Beu&#xD;
Brion !" said Headley, with a sardonic lath.&#xD;
Indeed ! that is singular !  I've had ny&#xD;
suspicions that for hunting was not he real ob..&#xD;
ject of this expedition," added Dorelle.&#xD;
" Whatother'object could there i e in view ?&#xD;
interrogated Ile~o Icy, snapping eagerly at the&#xD;
bait Dorelle had thrown out.&#xD;
" It isn't expedient for a man to tell his&#xD;
thoughts always ; but the noement I saw you&#xD;
this morning, I said to myself, 'this roan has a&#xD;
higher object than peltries ahead&#xD;
The attention of the Ileadley clique was fixed&#xD;
inquiringly upon Dorelle.&#xD;
- Foudrec! you are deceiving me ; confess&#xD;
now, that you have heard of the diEQovery of&#xD;
gold in the mountains I"&#xD;
The Missourian's eyes flashed with expecta,&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
" Speak low, Monsieur Dorelle, speak low,"&#xD;
he exclaimed, earnestly.&#xD;
"I knew I was right," asserted Dorelle, af-&#xD;
fecting to be elited at his far-siglrtedness.&#xD;
" You are wrong, sir; we have heard noth-&#xD;
ing of the discovery to which you refer ; but&#xD;
you see here a score of good fellows, ready for&#xD;
any enterprise that promises well, and will r ake&#xD;
them out of this infernal'region !'&#xD;
" Not so fast, my friend ! If you have not&#xD;
heard of Lhe new gold regions, it is best that I&#xD;
remain silent.. lla fois ! why should I dazzle&#xD;
you with the tales of a region surpassing in&#xD;
richness all the wealth of the oriental kings ; it&#xD;
would fill your dreams with extravagant incon-&#xD;
gruities, and destroy your peace when waking."&#xD;

'It is known only to a certain number of&#xD;

Headley rubbed his foiehead, and fidgeted&#xD;
about-nervously.&#xD;
" Will you allow me to ask if you have any&#xD;
intention, of turning this important affair to&#xD;
your own advantage ?" he inquired.&#xD;
" Selfinterest, I believe, is uppermost in the&#xD;
human mind, with very few exceptions. Like&#xD;
others, I am striving for a living, working dili-&#xD;
gently with my head and hands to accQmplish&#xD;
, my purpose. Would it not be natural that I&#xD;
should think much of what Ihave been telling&#xD;
you ? You will say yes, like a reasonable man,&#xD;
and be right, too ; for I have thought of this&#xD;
euhject, day and night, for weeks. There are&#xD;
difficulties to conquer, obstacles to surmount,&#xD;
dangers to meet ; but men of courage, determi-&#xD;
nation and perseverance can overcome all.&#xD;
What is there that man cannot do when the&#xD;
motive is powerful and the will strong? These&#xD;
mi nies are situated in a dangerous neighborhood,&#xD;
farther from us than the ground already travel-&#xD;
ed, in a different direction from our present&#xD;
route, through the countries of savage nations&#xD;
-the Utahs, the Navajoes, the Pimos, the Ma-&#xD;
ricopos; and lastly, the famous Apaches."&#xD;
A cloud of disappointment passed over-Head-&#xD;
ley's face-the distance, and danger startled&#xD;
him, and depressed his hopes.&#xD;
"You are speaking of that region lying be-&#xD;
tween New Mexico and the Great Basin-the&#xD;
country of an extinct nation-the Aztec ?" he&#xD;
added.&#xD;
" Yes, the land of the ancient Aztec, traces&#xD;
of whose art and industry yet remain."&#xD;
" Have you ever. been there, Monsieur Do-&#xD;
relle?"&#xD;
"I have passed months there; traversed its&#xD;
valleys and mountains, seen its rivers, gazed&#xD;
with awe upon the Casa Montezuma."&#xD;
"I imagined that was a fabulous fabric, ex-&#xD;
isting in the minds of credulous people."&#xD;
"Ah, my friend, you see before you a man&#xD;
who has acrtially seen the Casa Montezumna-a&#xD;
mighty. hut still grand ruin, where the great&#xD;
king, whose name is yet spoken with reverence&#xD;
by the native, once dwelt in barbaric splendor.&#xD;
The sight of that crumbling edifice, which&#xD;
seems to connect the past with- the present,&#xD;
produced emotions which I cannotdescribe It&#xD;
brought to my vision the phantom past, ven-&#xD;
2rable yet grim ; grey, yet gloomy ; silent,-yet&#xD;
speaking a language not to be misinterpreted,&#xD;
telling of enjoyments gone, glory departed,&#xD;
pon er decayed."&#xD;
Dorelle spoke with apparent enthusiasm, and&#xD;
was now the central point of attraction to the&#xD;
wondering group. The men gathered round&#xD;
&#xD;
him as if he were an oracle, unlocking the past&#xD;
as well as laying open' the future.  One who&#xD;
has the faculty of making others believe that&#xD;
he has heard more, seen more, and knows&#xD;
more than his auditors, will always stand, in&#xD;
their estimation, like Saul among the pro-&#xD;
phets.  Thus it was with Monsieur Dorelle t&#xD;
he was the hero of the hour, the marvel of the&#xD;
inexperienced and sanguine, wlho'sat that night&#xD;
at the camp-fire of the partisan.&#xD;
" A vast region of ruins and hidden wealth&#xD;
is that country," added Dorelle.  "The trea-&#xD;
snres of an extinct race are concealed ingen-&#xD;
iously beneath walls now crumbling, and&#xD;
buried in earth, now overgrown with rank&#xD;
weeds, with the mezquit, the pa'rasitie vine,&#xD;
the wild sage, and the dwarf pine. Foudre ! it&#xD;
sets my blood in a hot fever to think of it. A&#xD;
few hardy. adventurous men, a little faith, with&#xD;
boldness and perseverance, would suffice to ac-&#xD;
quire those riches. I have sought such per-&#xD;
sons; but, upon my honor. messieurs, I can-&#xD;
not find them--or rather, I cannot make them&#xD;
have confidence in the treasures of that coun-&#xD;
try."&#xD;
" You shall soon cease to complain, Monsieur&#xD;
Dorelle 1" cried Headley, looking at his friends.&#xD;
"Here are those who have not only faith. but&#xD;
resolution. Discontented with their present&#xD;
circumstances, they wait but an opportunity to&#xD;
change their course and their prospects. Tell&#xD;
me, sir, can the dangers you refer to be greater&#xD;
than that strange fatality that now follows in&#xD;
our trail like the Angel of Death,:transfixing one&#xD;
and another with his dart ?'&#xD;
A visible tremor shook Dorelle's person.&#xD;
" Not half so fearful " he replied, in a voice&#xD;
sunken almost to a whisper. "I can conceive&#xD;
of nothing more diabolical than the systematic&#xD;
killing of this savage or devil, or whatever he&#xD;
may chance to be.  Being ntrally supersti-&#xD;
tious, I acknowledge that 1 have much difficul-&#xD;
ty in persuading myself that this pathless,&#xD;
trackless power is human. Ah,messieurs. they&#xD;
may call him Redpath, if they will, but to ine&#xD;
he is a demon."&#xD;
"That's what I say 1" exclaimed Conroy,&#xD;
striking his right knee violently with the cor-&#xD;
responding hand, to give proper energy to hi.&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"And I, also," said Loretto, a Mexican, and&#xD;
Violette, a Creole, and half a dozen others.&#xD;
This is gratifying !" exclaiimed Dore lie. "I&#xD;
expected to become an ohje-et of ridicule among&#xD;
you, after making such an avowai; but I am&#xD;
agreeably disappointed. I am a Catholic, rues-&#xD;
sieurs, a staunch believer in the devil, end that&#xD;
the devil sometimes assists his instruments in&#xD;
the flesh."&#xD;
"No doubt of it I" muttered Loretto, erosss-&#xD;
ing himself.&#xD;
" My lads," said Headley, " what say you to&#xD;
turning our footsteps toward Gila River. in&#xD;
search of treasure ?"&#xD;

"6I care not whither we go, providing we but&#xD;
change our course," responded Conroy,, and!&#xD;
several others.&#xD;
"Will you lead us there, if we can enlist&#xD;
enough in our interest to make the expedition&#xD;
promising ?" asked the Missourian, again turn-&#xD;
ing toDorelle.&#xD;
Gladly I" he answered, emphatically.&#xD;
"Who will go ? who will go ?" cried Head-&#xD;
ley, with enthusiaaticE eagerness.  Come, let&#xD;
those who will go, speak-and speak in ear-&#xD;
nest!"&#xD;
Ten persons, comprising all in the group, in-&#xD;
*tantlysignitied their willingness to follow Do-&#xD;
relle, and desert lrion.&#xD;
" Warn them to be cautious, and not let their&#xD;
intentions be known," whispered Dorelle to the&#xD;
Missourian, who immediately gave instructions&#xD;
to that effect, which they promised to observe.&#xD;
-One thing we have overlooked ; we need&#xD;
an putflt to undertake such a long and, trying&#xD;
expedition ; all these things around us, we must&#xD;
bear in mind, belong to the American Fur&#xD;
Company, and not to us.',&#xD;
"I can assist you somewhat in regard to&#xD;
that," said Dorelle.  "I have a cache, forta-&#xD;
nately, pro ided for this very object."&#xD;
"Iif we were not where we are, I should cry&#xD;
' three cheers for Mionsieur Dorelle," said Head-&#xD;
ley, joyfully. 'Nov, my friends, fortune and&#xD;
ad venture are before us," he added, with an&#xD;
enthusiasm he did not attempt to disguise, and&#xD;
,which his companions shared.&#xD;
Buckeye, during this conversation, was sleep-&#xD;
ing (or seemed to be) on a pile of packs and&#xD;
saddles, a few yards distant.; his proximity was&#xD;
either not known or not cared for. Flash ap-&#xD;
proached his master. and smelled round him,&#xD;
as if to assure himself that he was there, and&#xD;
his footsteps had the effect to arouse him. He&#xD;
arose to his elbo'w,rubbed hieyes, then spoke&#xD;
to his horse. and finally walked to another part&#xD;
of the'encampment. '&#xD;
Brion. meanwhile, had left the corral, having&#xD;
evensuch directions as lie deemed necessary&#xD;
or the safety of all. The fatality attending his,&#xD;
'march weighed heavily upon .his mind.  As&#xD;
captain, or partisan,'lhe was responsible for the'&#xD;
safe conduct of the party to the trapping&#xD;
grounds   There were accidents and contin-1&#xD;
agencies against which he could not guard; but&#xD;
how should he nike it appear thus to his em-&#xD;
iuloye rs? W would not his leadership be faulted&#xD;
bythose whose pay he received ? Would they&#xD;
not call hie courage and perspicacity in ques-&#xD;
tion, when it was kn"wn that their enterprise&#xD;
was in danger of total failure through the agen-&#xD;
cy of a single savage, armed, as it would seem,&#xD;
'With a bow and arrow ?   The partisan was&#xD;
teady to pluck out his hair with vexation. As&#xD;
he had stated to Buckeye. lie was mortified and&#xD;
humiliated beyond measure. It made his&#xD;

believed it would certainly be said that he was&#xD;
wanting in energy, promptness, and foresight.&#xD;
What a thing to be said of Ben Brion-a man&#xD;
who had been on the trail ever since he left&#xD;
school, a mere boy !&#xD;
He paced slowly about the encampment, far&#xD;
enough from it not to be seen.,&#xD;
" Perchance," lie said, to himself, " my own&#xD;
brain may be pierced by the shaft of this se-&#xD;
cret foe. Be it thus; I alone will expose my-&#xD;
self to his aim this night. If he has the temer-&#xD;

perhaps, regret his boldness ! Alt! I am for-&#xD;

The partisan sighted, and thought of Mignon.&#xD;
" It might have been-it might have been ! "&#xD;
he added, in a low tone. that savored much of&#xD;
sadness. What it was that mightt have been"&#xD;
he dic, not say, but instantly shaking off his&#xD;
dreaminess, began to act the keen and watchful&#xD;
scout, a thing which a sojourn of over ten&#xD;
years in the mountains had rendered easy, and&#xD;
which, hitherto, had been attended with a kind&#xD;
of pleasure ; but this was before lie met Mig-&#xD;
non, and lost his heart-since which event he&#xD;
had experienced less happiness in the practice&#xD;
of his wandering trade. Mignon followed him&#xD;
everywhere ; Mignon was tireless it pursuing&#xD;
him ; Mignon was with hint in his dreams;&#xD;
she was a fair, but ever-present spirit, that&#xD;
could not be laid.&#xD;
The realization of all this revealed the moun-&#xD;
taineer to himself in a new light. He had not'&#xD;
supposed it quite possible that lie could be cap-&#xD;
tivated by a pretty face, and so enslaved by the&#xD;
charming conqueror ; it was a new revelation,&#xD;
a hitherto unread page in his own character.&#xD;
He believed his passion hopeless ; and not only&#xD;
hopeless, but foolish extremely. He did not&#xD;
expect to see Mignon again,and it was madness&#xD;
to cherish her resemblance so fondly.&#xD;
Althottgh reflectionslike these went teeming&#xD;
through Brion's brain, it did not'divert him&#xD;
from his duty ; he kept his dangerous vigils&#xD;
with firmness and skill, exposing himself thus,&#xD;
voluntarily, to be faithful tp his trust, and save&#xD;
those under his direction. Men are apt to&#xD;
think soberly and rationally in the silence and&#xD;
quietude of night, and it was thus with the&#xD;
partisan. He asked what or who it was that&#xD;
he feared ; or, more properly, that threatened&#xD;
thedestruction of his trappers and hunters. He&#xD;
had heard the name of Red path spoken often&#xD;
in the moputains, when encamped by lonely&#xD;
streams and distant solitudes; sturdy veterans&#xD;
had recounted his deeds, while friendly Indian&#xD;
told of his cunning-attributing his success to&#xD;
the interposition of Maehbinito, te had spirit;.&#xD;
but how much of this did he credit? What hind&#xD;
happened under his own observation to prove&#xD;
that these tales were not without foundation;&#xD;
that there was really truth in what mountain&#xD;

standing with his righ'tsrm on the saddle, his&#xD;
face partially concealed from the eyes of the'&#xD;
approaching youth by thehorse'shead. Crevier&#xD;
advanced hesitatingly, the negro pressing closer&#xD;
to him.as he drew near. The partisan was ner-&#xD;
vously anxious to obtain a fair view of his fea-&#xD;
tuaes-a fact ehl aing an niportat change in&#xD;
his feelings since the night Crevier sat by his&#xD;
lonely fire.&#xD;
"It is, indned, a woman," he said,-nentally.&#xD;
Mariot ws.u no less anxious to see the youth,&#xD;
and mark his bearing.&#xD;
"Well, shr," said Pierre, abruptly, "I have&#xD;

C'revier recoiled at the sound of Mariot's&#xD;
voice, and was much agitated. The negro&#xD;
whispered to him, which in some degree re-&#xD;
stored his self-possession.&#xD;
The partisan noticed that Mariot evinced&#xD;
surprise, which betrayed itself in his tones.&#xD;
" Why do you wish to question me ?" asked&#xD;
Crevier, with some trepidation. -&#xD;
"For the object I have stated."  -&#xD;
"What if I refuse to answer them Y" Crevier&#xD;

dressing Crevier, "that I'm disposed to Con-&#xD;
&#xD;
sider you a spy in the employ of the American&#xD;
Fur Company ?"&#xD;
"You are at liberty to think so," was the&#xD;
quiet rejoinder.&#xD;
"Captain Callard, it'will be necessary that&#xD;
this young man be severely punished, as an&#xD;
example to others."&#xD;
"That is my opinion, Monsieur Mariot."&#xD;
The partisan was observing Mariot as well as&#xD;
his position would allow, and plainly perceived&#xD;
that he was endeavoring to terrify Crevier and&#xD;
throw him off his guard; but if that was his&#xD;
intention, he filed--the youth remained un-&#xD;
daunted.&#xD;
a "How  are spies usually punished, cap&#xD;
tain ?" -&#xD;
"Oh, with death, monsieur, always"&#xD;
" That was my impression. W ha is this&#xD;
black man's name ?"&#xD;
"Bal'an," said Callard.&#xD;
" Well, Balaam will have to suffer with his&#xD;
master."&#xD;
In answer to'this consoling information, Bas&#xD;
Iaam looked at the moon, and winked assidu-&#xD;
ously.&#xD;
"Leave me a few moments with this young&#xD;
man, captain, snd take the nger with you."&#xD;
" Come, Balsam," said Callard.&#xD;
"I stays with massa, allers," replied Balaam,&#xD;
firmly.&#xD;
" But I wish you to go," said Mariot.&#xD;
"An' I  wish to stay where I is," returned&#xD;
B~alaam, pertinaciously.&#xD;
The captain approached him with the inten&#xD;
tion of laying his right hand upon his shouklet&#xD;
to lead him away; but Balaam assumed such&#xD;
a belligerent attitude, that he deemed it pru-&#xD;
dent to foregothis purpose, and walk off with.&#xD;
out him.&#xD;
"This is all very strange," said Mariot, when&#xD;
the captain was out of hearing.&#xD;
" What do you refer to ?" asked Crevier, in&#xD;
a faltering voice.&#xD;
"It is useless to wear the mask longer, Mad,&#xD;
emoiselle Mignon."g&#xD;
"My secret is discovered, alas I" cried the&#xD;
youth.&#xD;
" Oh, it required but a glance to penetrate&#xD;
your disguise.q He that loves has sharp eyes,"&#xD;
Mariot rejoined, with something of triumph in&#xD;
his manner.&#xD;
"Let me entreat that you will not betray&#xD;
me, Monsieur Mariot?"aid Mignon, in suppli-&#xD;
cating tones.&#xD;
" Ab, Mignon, had it been for my sake. I&#xD;
should be the happiest of men ; but I dare nos&#xD;
flatter myself that such is the cace I" said Pierre,&#xD;
softlyv.&#xD;
"Far his asket" muttered .Brion.&#xD;
"s Do not flatter yourself too much, mon&#xD;

..That I had repented ?"&#xD;
" Precisely."&#xD;
" But you see I have not?"&#xD;
"Do 3 on know, Mademoiselle Bellmar, that&#xD;
this frankness may injure you?"   ;&#xD;
"Exphain."&#xD;
"Do you not perceive that you are in my&#xD;

 Oh, you are there !"&#xD;
- Yes; 1 command' here. I sued at West-,&#xD;

" I forgot. for the instant thatI was talking&#xD;
to a villain," replied Mignon, with dignity.&#xD;
" Excellent," quotli the partisan. "She has&#xD;
him there !''&#xD;
"M giotn, reflect upon yoursituation. Have&#xD;
power to protect you-to keep your secret, to&#xD;
preserve you trom ridicule."&#xD;
"And if you were a gentleman, you would.&#xD;
do so unconditionally."&#xD;
That your conduct has been bold and un-&#xD;
maidenly,'I think you must own; with such a&#xD;
precedent before rme, I may venture to be bold&#xD;
and unmanly. What have you to answer to&#xD;
such logic "&#xD;
"Unmanly you are ; but if by boldness you&#xD;
mean physical courage, I should say you will&#xD;
never be bold."&#xD;
" Be sarcastic, if you will; yet it seems to&#xD;
rime that we meet under circumstances in which&#xD;
you would do well to abate your pride and&#xD;
hold hurnbier language. You are at present so&#xD;
situated, as to be under my authority."&#xD;
-I do not acknowledge your authority. You&#xD;
cannot, without an unwarrantable usurpation&#xD;
of power, 'restrain my actions or control my&#xD;
movements."&#xD;
" Your personal comfort shall be attended to&#xD;
is far as my means will allow, and you shall be&#xD;
treated with respect by my men ; but you must&#xD;
know that, you are not at liberty to leave the&#xD;
party."&#xD;
"D are you thus presume to take from merny&#xD;
freedom? B,' what right, Monsieur Mariot, do&#xD;
you thus assume authority over me ?"&#xD;
" By the right of might."&#xD;
"That is well answered ; but hear my pro-&#xD;
test. I will not submit to your tyranny. There&#xD;
must be men of honor in your party. I will&#xD;
tfrrow myself upon their generosity; they will&#xD;
preteet me."&#xD;
-' These men are in my pay."&#xD;
&#xD;
" And my father's, too ; you forget that you&#xD;
are the junior partnerr"&#xD;
" I remember everything that I wish to re-&#xD;

'A rare faculty."&#xD;
"In the name of all that is wild and marvel.&#xD;
lous, tell me your motive for unsexing. your.&#xD;
self and running such a quixotic career ?"&#xD;
" That is a secret of my own keeping, for-&#xD;
tunately."&#xD;
"Your motive must have been extraordina-&#xD;
ry. Your father will lose his reason when he&#xD;
hears of this ?"&#xD;
"God avert such a calamity !" exclaimed&#xD;
Mignon, with fervor.&#xD;
"You do well to invoke the name of God&#xD;
after committing this.fatal error. You should&#xD;
have reflected anddeported y ourselfas becomes&#xD;
one of your sex and age. But this mountain&#xD;
pilgrimage, I'll wager my reputation, is all for&#xD;
love!"    ,.&#xD;
"Don't wager your reputation, Monsieur&#xD;
Pierre-the stake is too great l"&#xD;
" You sustain your part bravely, I'll admit ;&#xD;
but be assured I'll probeyoursecret to the bot-&#xD;
tom, , Ah, Mignon, the time will come when&#xD;
you shall-redden with shame at the sound of&#xD;
my voice, it shall so remind you of your folly.",&#xD;
"It remninds me 'of everything absurd at this&#xD;
moment."&#xD;
Balaam rubbed his hands and laughed. Ma-&#xD;
riot bit his lip with vexation, and called Cal-&#xD;
lard, who was waiting his pleasure at the near-&#xD;
est fire.&#xD;
He came, and with him two persons-Gren-&#xD;
ier and Kincaid,&#xD;
"Men," said Mariot, "you are to watch this&#xD;
youth, this Monsieur Crevier and his servant,&#xD;
and see that they do not leave the party. I&#xD;
have special reasons for wishing them to remain&#xD;
with us."&#xD;
Callard bowed and smiled.&#xD;
" Captain," said Miggon, gently, "1 hope we&#xD;
shall be friends ?,&#xD;
'"I-I trust so," responded Callard, consid-&#xD;
erably embarrassed.&#xD;
"Here is my hand, captain," she added, ex-&#xD;
tending that little member, with charming&#xD;
grace to the. leader, who could not refuse the&#xD;
tempting offer ; while Pierre beheld the de-&#xD;
monstration with ill-concealed anger and jeal-&#xD;
ousy.&#xD;
. " And yet, mad-Mr. Crevier, I mean-I ex-&#xD;
peet I shall be obliged to restrict you to certain&#xD;
limits ; but my authority shall be mildly ex-&#xD;
erted, believe me."&#xD;
" Beware, captain," said Pierre, with a fore-&#xD;
ed smile. " You're upon dangerous ground.'&#xD;
Mariot had advanced a little, and now stoot&#xD;
two paces in front of his horse, with the bridle.&#xD;
upon his arm. Callard, Kincaid, and Grenier&#xD;
were at his -right, at the distance of three or&#xD;
four yards, while Mignon and Balaam were on&#xD;

&#xD;
the left. Brion occupied a position to see the&#xD;
paties very well. What had just passed be-&#xD;
tween the captain and Mignon did not escape&#xD;
his n" ice, ut gave a painful ensation, which&#xD;
was new to him. Possibly it was for Callard&#xD;
that she hal left a happy home to tempt the&#xD;
dangers and hardships of the mountaia. Al-&#xD;
though the 1d a was unpleasant-for a moment,&#xD;
he really en vied the captain.&#xD;
Fortunate man I" he murmured. " Fortu-&#xD;
nate man; you have pressed that little hand I"&#xD;
The partisan's brow was clouded; -sorrow&#xD;
and indignation were contending within. At&#xD;
"ii  "nteirt, his limbs seemed losing their'&#xD;
stirength; at another, he appeared to be suffo-&#xD;
eatmavwith some new malady that pressed his&#xD;
heart froru his chest to his throat. He bent&#xD;
forward that not a word might escape him, so&#xD;
intensely interesting were the developments.&#xD;
Mariot turned to Grenier, and said&#xD;
"I suppose you are ready to render an ac-&#xD;
count of what you have done?"&#xD;
Grener was about to reply, when some ob-&#xD;
ject wikistled through the air. Grenier threw&#xD;
up his arms, rolled his eyes wildly, and fell up-&#xD;
on his face. There were simultaneous Cries of&#xD;
astonishment., The long, smoothly-wrought&#xD;
shaft of an arrow  protruded from  Grenier's&#xD;
ead.&#xD;
Mariot proceeded from the spot in absolute&#xD;
Ore,," na if -xpecting to feel the point of.the&#xD;
alel bolt in his own brain..&#xD;
"din  iu   "he eriwl, with a shudder&#xD;
Pierre Mariot," exclaimed Mignon, pointing&#xD;
at Grenier, - read your destiny; behold how&#xD;
fleaven ill punish your evil deeds !" ,&#xD;
""Ioor -d ! muttered Kincaid, despairingly,&#xD;
dropping   his chin upon his breast, while Cal-&#xD;
lad, with more presence of mind, sprang into&#xD;
the aniouang thicket, rifle in hand.&#xD;
.   "   iCome back," shouted Mariot ; but Callard&#xD;
was already in the bushes. . It was fortunate&#xD;
for Brion that the captain turned to the north-&#xD;
een instead of the western side, for it was from&#xD;
-that quarter that the arrow  had apparently&#xD;
beit projected. After beating about in the&#xD;
thicket for a few minutes, Callard returned,&#xD;
flying seen no enemy.&#xD;
""Look at your misguided instrument, and&#xD;
ell ien if you are prepared to goas suddenly ?"&#xD;
-aid Mignon to Pierre, warningly.&#xD;
I nustruroent ?" , repeated Mariot, with a&#xD;
quickness that proved she had touched a sensi-&#xD;
tive spot..'" You know too much, Mignon !"-&#xD;
'Now, would it not 'be singular, Monsieur&#xD;
Mariot, if you should 1heet the fate )  the man&#xD;
at your teet," she resumed,impressively.&#xD;
Pierre looked at the dead man, and breathed&#xD;
heavily; an indefinable awe was tugging at his&#xD;
heart-a phtait oum hand menaced him.&#xD;
Cahiari atte mipted to draw' the arrow from&#xD;
Grenier's head ; hut it broke close to the skull,&#xD;
thi- sr-el point remaining firmly embedded in&#xD;
brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mignon and Balaam walked toward the en&#xD;
campment ; Mariot followed in three minutes&#xD;
-the camp was astir, hunters and trappers&#xD;
running to the place where Grenier had fallen.&#xD;
The partisan hurried away from the locality,&#xD;
much excited by what he had seen and heard.&#xD;
Indeed, it was to him a night of startling reve-&#xD;
lations ; but being of a strong, well balanced&#xD;
mind, he regained his wonted calmness-to ap-&#xD;
pearance--before he reached the encampment&#xD;
his band.en&#xD;
Buckeye met him outside the corral, where&#xD;
he had been impatiently awaiting him.&#xD;
" By the beard of Joe Smith !" lie exclaimoed,&#xD;
"-I've a nice bone for you to pick, and have&#xD;
been waiting' to throw it to you for more than&#xD;
three hours."&#xD;
"Well, give it a toss-I will catch it," quoth&#xD;
Brion.&#xD;
" You'll growl over it, I'll warrant."&#xD;
"I promise not to bite."&#xD;
" Well, here it is: there's mutiny in the camp&#xD;
-the trappin' business is at a discount, and&#xD;
gold hunting' in' the Aztec kentry is at a pre-&#xD;
mnium."&#xD;
" Ahi"&#xD;
"Jes' so, eap'n, I reckon."&#xD;
" Who is at the head of the new enterprise ?"&#xD;
"Headley, of course ; but that new feller,&#xD;
the Frenchman, sprang the trap on 'em,"&#xD;
"Why, HIeadley apologized for his conduct?"&#xD;
"Perhaps he will aging; comes :ind of nat'-&#xD;
ral to him, don't it ?"&#xD;
"I, too, have made discoveries, Buckeye."&#xD;
" Open your-pack."&#xD;
"If I possess any considerable tact in read-&#xD;
ing human character, you are an honest man.&#xD;
May I reckon upon ydur friendship and assist-&#xD;
ance?"&#xD;
"By the beard of Joe Smith, yes ! When I&#xD;
forgett to treat you like a friend and brother,&#xD;
may the arrow of Redpath pierce my brain 1"&#xD;
" You are sincere, and. I will make you the&#xD;
repository of important matters. It will be a&#xD;
relief to share the secrets of the night with one&#xD;
whom I am sure will not betray me."&#xD;
The partisan then narrated the incidents al-&#xD;
ready placed before the reader,reserving to him-&#xD;
self the privilege of representing Mignon in a&#xD;
way as favorable to her as the case would pos-&#xD;
sibly admit. Of his passion for her, lie said no-&#xD;
thing ; indeed, he was not willing to acknowl-&#xD;
edge the existence of such a sentiment, even to&#xD;
himself ; and the pains he took to conceal it,&#xD;
served to awaken suspicions in the mind of the&#xD;
trapper, and point to the truth.&#xD;
" A reg'lar conspiracy ; very curious consarn&#xD;
-lucky thing that you watched Monsieur Ma-&#xD;
riot. I-concluded there was sumthin' wicked&#xD;
in him, while I lay, listening' among the packs&#xD;

earnestly.&#xD;
" He will come back to conduct Headley and&#xD;
his friends to the Casa Montezuma, and the&#xD;
land of treasure. How shall you receive him,&#xD;
cap'n ?"&#xD;
"I have not matured my plan, yet. Indeed,&#xD;
I am much disturbed and confused by the ex-&#xD;
traordinary things that have-providentially,&#xD;
let me believe-fallen under my observation I&#xD;
need time to reflect-to resolve on a course of&#xD;
conduct that shall be the most judicious, the&#xD;
best for my employers, my men, and, lastly,&#xD;
myself; for self, friend Buckeye, in an affair&#xD;
like this, ought to come last, and not be made&#xD;
to occupy the first place in my thoughts. Dan-&#xD;
ger encircles me like a belt ; but men have&#xD;
been in more precarious positions, and lived to&#xD;
tell the story of their escape ; thus may it be&#xD;
with me. There are some veterans in my&#xD;
party that I can rely on ; they will not fail&#xD;
me, I trust, in an emergency. We can deal&#xD;
with the.Blackfeet warriors. A surprise would&#xD;
be disastrous, extremely; but that peril is now&#xD;
comparatively small. To know an enemy's&#xD;
order of battle is to know how to meet him.&#xD;
With your aid,.it will be difficult for a war&#xD;
party of an hundred to approach our camp&#xD;
without discovery. I count you a dozen ordi-&#xD;
nary men; because you have much experience&#xD;
in Indian policy, and know how to look through&#xD;
the double sights."&#xD;
That's a compliment I'm  proud of, inso-&#xD;
much as it wasn't said by a common man by&#xD;
way of flattery Cap'n, I am at your orders&#xD;
from this minute ; tell me to do this or that, to&#xD;
reconnoitre, to follow trail, to watch for an&#xD;
enemy by eight, to fight till the last gasp, and&#xD;
I'll do it without questions. It's an offer I ne-&#xD;
ver made afore;,but by the beard of Joe Smith,&#xD;
there's sumthin' in ye I like."&#xD;
The partisan smiled pleasantly, and held out&#xD;
his hand. Buckeye gave it a rough and hearty&#xD;
grasp, thus sealing the friendly compact which&#xD;
was to last as long as the lives of the parties.&#xD;
It is now time that we return to Mignon, and&#xD;
take a casual glance at the passage of events&#xD;
some hat in their regular order. Mariot speed-&#xD;
ily made Bllmar acquainted with the fact that&#xD;
'mademoiselle had repudiated the long talked-&#xD;
of alliance. ; That gentleman received the in-&#xD;
foration with more calmness than he had an-&#xD;
ticipated. He told Pierre to be patient; he&#xD;
would see his daughter ;. he trusted the matter&#xD;
would be satisfactorily arranged ; there was no&#xD;
&#xD;
need of excitement; he had skill to manage it&#xD;
properly. Mariot was led to hope in the ulti-&#xD;
mate surrenderof the fair citadel; we will learn&#xD;
how he prospered.&#xD;
MonsieurBellnlar at length broached-the suh-&#xD;
t ject gently to Mignon, who demanded to know&#xD;
why lie was desirous of such a union. He re-&#xD;
plied that he was anxious for such a consum-&#xD;
nation for several reasons.&#xD;
" Is Monsieur Mariot a man of honor ?" she&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
Bellmar was confused.,&#xD;
" As much so, perhaps, a&amp;amp; the average of&#xD;
mankind," he answered.&#xD;
"Is he possessed of even con mon honesty ?"&#xD;
" What a strange question, Mignon," he re-&#xD;
turned, evasively.&#xD;
"Do you consult my happiness only, in this&#xD;
alliance ?"she demanded.&#xD;
" What else should I consult ?"&#xD;
" Interest-worldly interest, possibly."&#xD;
"Such a marriage would be advautagous in&#xD;
a pecuniary point of view, I admit "&#xD;
" Do you fear his anger in case of my refu-&#xD;
sal?"&#xD;
"Pierre, you remember, inherited his father's&#xD;
property, which was worth at his decease far&#xD;
more than mine ; Pierre wished to enlarge our&#xD;
business, when he succeeded his father in the&#xD;
house, and having considerable money, the&#xD;
savings of my late partner, he made an invest-&#xD;
ment of capital beyond my means ; so that, in&#xD;
truth, I am his debtor to a large am ount, which&#xD;
might make it exceedingly awk ard, should&#xD;
he wish for a dissolution of the house of Bell-&#xD;
mar &amp;amp; M'ariot."&#xD;
"But all your resources are not invested;&#xD;
during the many years of your labors, you&#xD;
must have amassed enough to insure you a&#xD;
competence ?"&#xD;
"-I have laid by something for you, my&#xD;
child,-whict you shall have."&#xD;
"Well, then, my father, let us he content.&#xD;
Pierre is a villain ; and I will not consent to be&#xD;
united to a bad man. Whenever you are clos-&#xD;
eted with him, you should pray : -'Lead me not&#xD;
into temptation, but deliver me from evil.'"&#xD;
" One would think you had been listening ?"&#xD;
he exclaimed, with displeasure.    '&#xD;
"And correct]', too; for I happened to be&#xD;
in the room adjoining the library, at the time&#xD;
of your interview with Pierre in regard to the&#xD;
American Fur Company."-&#xD;
" And you heard all ?" cried Bellmar, ex-&#xD;
cited.   M&#xD;
" All, my father. And I heard also-what&#xD;
you did not-the development of his scheme."&#xD;
"The following day, with three men ?"&#xD;
" Yes. Can you now say to me : *'My daugh-&#xD;
ter, I wish-you to marry Monsieur Mariot, for&#xD;
he is a worthy man.' "&#xD;
Bellman pressed his hands to his forehead,&#xD;
and made no'answer.&#xD;
Mignon related circumstantially all that had&#xD;
&#xD;
40&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
transpired at the interview between Mariot,&#xD;
Grenier, Kincaid, and Gardette; to which her&#xD;
audi or listened without once looking at her,&#xD;
or e hanging his attitude.&#xD;
"  all this villany to transpire without one.&#xD;
effort to prevent it ?' Mignon asked, with in-&#xD;
genuons warmth, when the narration was&#xD;
completed.&#xD;
" What can be done? Mariot will act as he&#xD;
Pleases," said Bellmar.&#xD;
" What, will you suffer yourself to be com-&#xD;
promised in character by the machinations of a&#xD;
bad man? Do you notsee that his evil schem-&#xD;
ing must sooner or later become known? Too&#xD;
many persons have his secrets in possession,&#xD;
each of whom would betray him for a few dol-&#xD;
lars. Are you then to connive at murder, my&#xD;
dear father? Are you to be the accomplice of&#xD;
assassins ?"&#xD;
Al ignou spoke earnestly, and Bellmar began&#xD;
to be startled by her representations.&#xD;
"Indeed, you move me, Mignon. I had not&#xD;
considered the subject in a light so serious."&#xD;
" Your hair, my father, is already silvery.&#xD;
Would you add crime to age, and die with the&#xD;
dark mark of Cain upon your brow? Act while&#xD;
w hile there is time, I entreat of you !"&#xD;
" I ama powerless, powerless!  Mariot has&#xD;
sent his emisaries: they are far upon their&#xD;
way. I cannot overtake them, if I would ; for&#xD;
you know, Nlignon, that the fire and energy of&#xD;
youth has departed years ago. I regret what lie&#xD;
has done, extremely ; his plans are both rash&#xD;
and wicked : Mon Dieu, my child, I am trou-&#xD;
-bled."&#xD;
"Now you speak according to the dictates of&#xD;
nature and religion, and your voice is pleasant.&#xD;
-Ah, if you listen to Pierre, you will leave me&#xD;
but a legacy of infamy !"&#xD;
But what can I do, girl?"&#xD;
-- DI-solve all connection with Mariot, even&#xD;
at a great p.-ciitry sacrifice. Let him with-&#xD;
draw his capital-suffer him to do his worst--&#xD;
the law will protect you; you will be a gainer&#xD;
to rid yourself of him at any price."&#xD;
1 I believe that is the truth, Mignon. World-&#xD;
ly interests may have blinded.my eyes, but do&#xD;
you think I am a very bad man at heart, my&#xD;
daughter?"             -&#xD;
Ohl no; at heart you are good ; therefore,&#xD;
you should not be unequally yoked with an&#xD;
unbeliever in human virtue, a contemner qf&#xD;
honesty, a scoffer at religion, an apostate from&#xD;
honor. Say you will try to save Brion's party&#xD;
from destructionn, and let the house of Bellmar&#xD;
&amp;amp; Mariot fall? kIow your gray hairs would&#xD;
look at the bar of justice I how your head&#xD;
would droop with shame under the heavy pres.&#xD;
sure of guilt !"&#xD;
" Perhaps Mariot will relent."&#xD;
" But you have .said it is already too late ;&#xD;
lie has sent hired assassins to dog the honest&#xD;
partisan, to out off men engaged in a lawful&#xD;
ealing."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Parbleu ! woman's instincts are said to be&#xD;
quick and true ; come, what shall I do ?"&#xD;
"You will trust it to rue ?"&#xD;
" I will trust it to you "&#xD;
" And you will allow me money, and what.-&#xD;
ever you may wish."&#xD;
Mignon embraced her father, who went on to&#xD;
say that business would compel hin to go to&#xD;
St. Louis, to be absent three weeks; but lhe&#xD;
trusted in her discretion, having no fears that&#xD;
she would be guilty of follies.&#xD;
" Your mind," he continued, "is fertile in&#xD;
expedients. while mine has lost the greater&#xD;
part of its strength and vigor. I am willing, I&#xD;
am more than willing -I am anxious that&#xD;
Pierre's designs should be thwarted.  But&#xD;
Brion has gone; where, I know not. We hoped&#xD;
our party 'would be in advance of him, but his&#xD;
activity has outdone us.  If Brion is at Fort&#xD;
Leavenworth, a faithful messenger might be&#xD;
sent to warn him to be on his guard--without&#xD;
compromising myself or Mariot. A few vague&#xD;
hints judiciously thrown out would be suffi-&#xD;
cient, without calling names, or indicating the&#xD;
precise nature of the danger."&#xD;
" Was not Captain Brion here a week ago ?"&#xD;
"Yes, he was after men; but most of them&#xD;
being already engaged by me, he left the same&#xD;
day, and since that time, has passed through&#xD;
all the frontier towns of any note, in search of&#xD;
hunters and'trappers. And this is why it is so&#xD;
difficult to find him."&#xD;
"When will your band be ready to start?"&#xD;
"In ten days."&#xD;
"Numbering how many men?"&#xD;
"One hundred."&#xD;
"And commanded by--"&#xD;
" Captain Callard."&#xD;
The foregoing conversation led to that extra-&#xD;
ordinary resolution which resulted in the pil-&#xD;
grinage of Mignon, in male attire, to the wes-&#xD;
tern wilds. She hoped to find the partisan at&#xD;
Fort Leavenworth, make such communication&#xD;
as she might without directing suspicion to-&#xD;
ward her father, and return without a protrac-&#xD;
ted absence. She waited her father's depar-&#xD;
ture with impatience, that she might put her&#xD;
plan into execution, but he delayed it day after&#xD;
day.  Ten days elapsed before he set out for&#xD;
St. Louis, and even then Qallard had not se-&#xD;
cured his complement of men.&#xD;
Mignon abandoned the expectation of finding&#xD;
Brion at Fort Leavenworth, so much time had&#xD;
passed since he left Westport-therefore deter-&#xD;
mined upon that course of conduct which&#xD;
finally introduced her to the reader on the&#xD;
prairies.&#xD;
Having once formed the project, she set&#xD;
about preliminary operations with an earnest-&#xD;
ness that conquered obstacles, and a foresight&#xD;
that would not have been dise'editable to a&#xD;
veteran trapper. Her perspicacity owed much&#xD;
of its acuteness, however, to observation, de-&#xD;
rived from the associations which her father's&#xD;

&#xD;
business naturally threw around her.  From&#xD;
her earliest recollections she had seen hunters&#xD;
and trappers, heard their tales of adventure ;&#xD;
they were a class whose habits and peculiari-&#xD;
ties were most familiar. She knew the nature&#xD;
of the perils that attended them in their long&#xD;
excursions, amid the rugged and snowy moun-&#xD;
tains, what kind of an outfit they needed, their,&#xD;
mode of travelling and defence ; and lastly,&#xD;
how, when, and where they practiced tlieir&#xD;
trade.&#xD;
Balaam was a faithful servant, who had been&#xD;
many years in the family. It was the particu-&#xD;
lar wish of Madame Bellmar, at the time, of&#xD;
her decease (which-was when Mignon was but&#xD;
a child), that Balasai should always be consid-&#xD;
ered a member of the household, and be treated&#xD;
with kindness-which desire had been strictly&#xD;
observed and respected.  Balaam was not, as&#xD;
the reader may be inclined to conjecture, fee-&#xD;
ble and in hiS dotage, but robust, and a giant&#xD;
in strength. At'fifty years, with power undi-&#xD;
minished by hardship and abuse, he was at the&#xD;
best period of his manhood.' Mignon found in&#xD;
him an able coadjutor-after she had overcome&#xD;
his scruples and silenced )is objections-for&#xD;
Balaam had twice been to Bellmar's trading&#xD;
house in the country of the Nez Perees. -&#xD;
When her preparations were completed, she&#xD;
proceeded to Fort Leavenworth, accompanied&#xD;
by this faithful friend and servant.: Brion had&#xD;
departed.&#xD;
Tie description of the slender youth, in the&#xD;
opening chapter, precludes the necessity of de-&#xD;
scribing Mignon's appearahee when she joined&#xD;
the trappers at Fort Leavenworth. Previous&#xD;
to starting, she wrote an affectionate letter for&#xD;
her father-who two days before had left for&#xD;
St Louis, placing it where he would be sure&#xD;
'to find it.  The advent of Mignon among the&#xD;
hunters was looked upon by Callard with sus-&#xD;
picion ; she soon perceived that she was&#xD;
watched ; and deprecated from her heart that&#xD;
seltish interest that fills the human soul with&#xD;
distrust.&#xD;
Halasani," said Mignon, "is there pot some-&#xD;
thing you wish to say to me ?"&#xD;
" Dar is, Massa Crevier," replied Balaam.&#xD;
"Well, there is no one in hearing ; proceed."&#xD;
"Does ye see dat fire ober dar ?"&#xD;
" Yes, Balaam."&#xD;
" Whose fire dat is, ye spect ?"&#xD;
Mignon answered that she could form no&#xD;
supposition, whatever.&#xD;
Balaam informed her that Captain Brion was&#xD;
encamped there for the night.&#xD;
" Alone ?" inquired Mignon.&#xD;
Balaam replied in the affirmative, explaining&#xD;
that his party were in advance, he having left&#xD;
Fort Leavenworth but a few hours before Cal-&#xD;
lard began his march.&#xD;
"I must speak to Captain Brion," added&#xD;
Mignon.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Dat am diffikilt," quoth Balaam.&#xD;
"Do you think we are watched?".&#xD;
" Ebry minit, Missy Mignon."&#xD;
"Hush ! call me Master Crevier. Will put&#xD;
this matter to the test. I will walk leisurely&#xD;
from the camp, and you will remain here. 1&#xD;
I need you, I will discharge my rifle, the use of&#xD;
which you have so well. taught me. If I an'&#xD;
followed, you will be sure to observe the cir~-&#xD;
cumstance."&#xD;
The fire to which Balaam had cited Mignon's&#xD;
attention, was, distant nearly half a mile, but&#xD;
on account of an intervening valley did not&#xD;
seem halfso far.&#xD;
She left the encampment, advancing with&#xD;
mingled emotions of timidity and heroism.&#xD;
How novel was her situation I What unfriend'&#xD;
ly constructions her conduct might bear! But&#xD;
she arose superior to weakness ; she felt ai&#xD;
strength that surprised herself, and prayed that&#xD;
those might be forgiven whose unhappy tern-&#xD;
perament it is to think evil of others. She&#xD;
would save her aged father frorA becoming par.&#xD;
taker of another's sins-from sharing another's&#xD;
crime. That vas just-that was praiseworthy&#xD;
-that was right--and all the sophistry in the&#xD;
world could not make right wrong. She grew&#xD;
strong in moral power, a shield of protection&#xD;
was over, above, around her. Her fears were&#xD;
dispelled by the strength of virtue, and the&#xD;
consciousness of truth.  .&#xD;
Mignon heard'steps, and looking around, saw&#xD;
Captain Callard following her. She paused&#xD;
upon a gentle eminence-the same where she&#xD;
first appeared to the reader. It has been shown&#xD;
how she reached the bivouac of Brion, meeting&#xD;
with a receptionfrom that worthy man, which,&#xD;
though civil, was notecordial.&#xD;
Mignon's calmness was. severely shaken by&#xD;
the trapper's coldness, which caused her to re-&#xD;
alize but too sensibly the peculiar awkwardness&#xD;
of her position To conceal her feelings. she&#xD;
assumed that thoughtful, abstracted air which&#xD;
we noted in the proper place, such a mood&#xD;
giving her a natural pretext for averting her&#xD;
face fr m the mountaineer. She had flattered&#xD;
herself that she could meet Brion unshrinking-&#xD;
ly, and warn him of -the danger impending&#xD;
without effort or hesitation ; but now she found&#xD;
herself overwhelmed by innumerable scruples.&#xD;
and a diffidenee quite unaccountable.&#xD;
She was observed, too.; Callard was behind&#xD;
a tree, not fifty yards distant ; he showed him-&#xD;
self to Mignon, with his right forefinger upon&#xD;
his lips, and his left held up in menace ; thie&#xD;
pantomime signified that she should be silent.&#xD;
She was cruelly embarrassed; but a remarka-&#xD;
ble power of self-control kept her outwardly&#xD;
calm. She resolved not to be thwarted ; when&#xD;
she had sufficient command over her voice, she&#xD;
said, without changing her meditative attitude&#xD;
or expression:&#xD;
" Captain Brion, there is danger near you ; I&#xD;
have come to put you upon your guard ; but&#xD;
&#xD;
Ir&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BUCKEYE RANGER.&#xD;
&#xD;
I am watched ; a man behind yonder tree is&#xD;
alnnost near enough to hear my voice."&#xD;
Mignon waited for a response ; the moun-&#xD;
taineer was already asleep, while Captain Cal-&#xD;
lard was drawing nearer.  She arose to go,&#xD;
when, to her horror, she discovered a serpent&#xD;
winding its unsightly body into a coil, three&#xD;
paces from the partisan's head. To seize a long&#xD;
fagot and dispatch the loathsome creature, was&#xD;
the work of a moment only ; she marvelled at&#xD;
her own promptitude and boldness as soon as&#xD;
the deed was accomplished.   Excited and&#xD;
trembling, she hurried from the spot to meet&#xD;
Balaam, who was approaching. Eluding Cal-&#xD;
lard, she returned to the encampment, glad&#xD;
that her feeble hand had been the instrument&#xD;
of Providence in the preservation of the trap-&#xD;
per.&#xD;
It was after this partial failure that Mignon&#xD;
resolved on another experiment. As has been&#xD;
anticipated, it was through her agency that the&#xD;
hatchet had been left where it would fall into&#xD;
the hands of Brion, the dumb bearer of a con-&#xD;
cealed message. Balaam had been trusted with,&#xD;
that commission, and despite the espionage of&#xD;
Callard, succeeded in discharging it successful-&#xD;
ly by adroit management.  Mignon had en-&#xD;
joined on him to be careful that a portion of&#xD;
the slip of paper be left visible, that it might&#xD;
immediately, be seen by the finder--an item&#xD;
&#xD;
43&#xD;
&#xD;
which he so far overlooked, that, as we have&#xD;
seen, it was several days before it attracted the&#xD;
partisan's attention. To mystify the latter,&#xD;
Balaam had adopted the expedient of breaking&#xD;
the trail by grasping a mammoth vine that&#xD;
hung pendant from a tree, and swinging him-&#xD;
self forward across a small gully where the&#xD;
ground was soft ; this was why the trapper&#xD;
was baffled.&#xD;
By a skillful manmeuvre,.Mignon evaded the&#xD;
vigilance of Callard, after the two hands had&#xD;
passed Fort Laramie, and joining the partisan,&#xD;
conversed with lim in the manner related, not&#xD;
doubting but her warning had been read and&#xD;
understood; or, at least sufliciently compre-&#xD;
hended to make the captain so cautious .as to&#xD;
frustrate the designs of his enemies  She&#xD;
wished on that occasion to speak to him free-&#xD;
ly; but, unfortunately, she confounded Buck-&#xD;
eye with Gardette, the half-breed, who was&#xD;
acting for Mariot ; and hence her silence on&#xD;
'he subject ever uppermost in her thoughts.&#xD;
While she wans planning an expedient to rid&#xD;
herself of his presence, Balaam appeared in the&#xD;
distance, motioning her to return. to the party.&#xD;
inasmuch as her absence was exciting inquiry&#xD;
-a series of signals previously agreed upon.&#xD;
We are now ready to tell what happened to&#xD;
Mignon after her unexpected interview with&#xD;
Monsieur Mariot.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
MIGNON MEETS RAVENCLAW.&#xD;
Mignon loved liberty.  Nothing could be&#xD;
more repugnant to her feelings than the idea'of&#xD;
personal restraint, especially when exercised&#xD;
y a main whose character she detested.  To&#xD;
remain with the band and be subject to the&#xD;
authority of Pierre Mariot, was a contingent&#xD;
entirely ~abhorrent to her notion of her o wn&#xD;
rights and privileges. It was also at variance&#xD;
with her instinctive delicacy to be brought&#xD;
again into contact with those who already knew.&#xD;
or mistrusted her sex ; who could neither tn.&#xD;
derstand her motives nor pity her confusion.&#xD;
To avoid being so awkwardly and painfully&#xD;
placed-an object, perchance, of rude con-&#xD;
merit and ridicule -to evade Mariot's vigilance&#xD;
and escape his domination, became her'ruling&#xD;
desire.  In the event of success, should she&#xD;
throw herself upon the protection of Brion.,or&#xD;
attempt to return home across the wide prai.&#xD;
ries, attended by Balaamn only? 'The first was&#xD;
not without objections, but it appeared most&#xD;
safe and feasible.  Mignon believed it would&#xD;
be best to act upon her determination promptly,&#xD;
while Mariot was still laboring under surprise,&#xD;
before he had artfully deliberated, arranged his&#xD;
plan of action, and systematized his espionage&#xD;
over her conduct.&#xD;
During her pilgrimage, Mignon had nightly&#xD;
been protectod by a small tent, which Bahaam&#xD;
had provided for that purpose, and which lie&#xD;
was expert in putting up~ and taking down.&#xD;
The tent had two comparttments,in thte smaller&#xD;
of Which slept Balaam, like a faithful watch-&#xD;
dog, ever on the alert, ready to start up for her&#xD;
defence at the first approach of danger. He&#xD;
kindled andi kept the fires also, when fires were&#xD;
needful, cooking with skill, preparing the choi-&#xD;
cest cuts of venison for his adventurous young&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
So it will hence be seen that Mignon passed&#xD;
the time, when not on the march, quite by her-&#xD;
self, apart from the motley mixture of men&#xD;
composing Callard's, band. The services of&#xD;
Balaamn were many and important.   His ad-&#xD;
vice was always seaisonable ; she trusted in his&#xD;
sagacity, anticipating protection from  his&#xD;
strong arm in every emergency which might&#xD;
occur. he was proud of her contilence; will-&#xD;
ing to make any sacrifice that human creature&#xD;

nans of assmIt and veigeatteo, because Nature&#xD;
had gifted  him with hands of remarkable&#xD;

and administert corporial pain.  Bavai twas&#xD;
of a patient. genial disposition, but w'hn a&#xD;
quarrel was forced upot thim. and his ftliigs&#xD;
were outraged, he was an antagonist gre-aly to&#xD;
he feared. Those so umefortunate as to feel the&#xD;
stunning power of his fist repented their rash-&#xD;
ness, and cared not to provoke his ire agltin.&#xD;
Bthiam 'was consulted in reference to the&#xD;
emergency that had arisen. She explained to&#xD;
him her rea-ons for not wishing to remain with&#xD;
the party, which, in his view, were sufficiently&#xD;
cogent; indeed, her mere will would have betae&#xD;
considered inperative, without asilngle al gu.&#xD;
ment. She said to him :&#xD;
" We can escape more readily to-night than&#xD;
to-morrow, or any subsequent period."&#xD;
" Dat an a fack," quot. tBalamn.&#xD;
"Come, my friend," she continued, " how&#xD;
shall it be doie ?"&#xD;
" I want to know just where yer gwine when&#xD;
yer git away; dat's de question dat quiress&#xD;
splainiin'."        '&#xD;
"Perhaps I shall throw myself upon the pro-&#xD;
tection of Captain Brion."-&#xD;
"The man you-"&#xD;
" The man 1-what, Balaam ?" said Mignon,&#xD;
-sharply, coloring.&#xD;
'" Nuii of no consequence," replied Balsam.&#xD;
"Dorn't 'sturb me; I'm thinkin' how it can be&#xD;
done."&#xD;
" I'll wait patiently."&#xD;
The African remained silent for some five&#xD;
minutes.&#xD;
" We shall want our bosses," he said, at&#xD;
length.&#xD;
Mignon stsented.&#xD;
" Well, dis' chile mustcrawl dut dar 'montgst&#xD;
'em, cut de side-lines, and lead 'em off softly ,&#xD;
while you creep away in nether direction."&#xD;
"Yes, Ba:iarn."&#xD;
" Den I jines ye wid de losses, ober dar b3&#xD;
dem cotton-wooas "   .11&#xD;
"Suppose you should be discovered ?"&#xD;
"Dis eommlod feller fight-git away. I'll meet&#xD;
ye dare, sure,'twixt dis and norain'-pervidia&#xD;
you git dar.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"'That I can do, believe -me. You see I am&#xD;
small-I can m ove quietly. Look out, and ob-&#xD;
serve what is going on."&#xD;
Baaami did as bidden, reporting that most of&#xD;
the party were gathered around the dead body&#xD;
of Grenitr, but he could hear voices in Cal-&#xD;
lard's tent.&#xD;
'- The fate of that man was sudden and aw-&#xD;
ful; but I amagined I saw in his death the&#xD;
hand of ret ributive justice," said Mignon.&#xD;
"Red path am about," said the black, in an&#xD;
und-r tone.&#xD;
h Yes, it would really seem that there is such'&#xD;
a personage; he was spoken of by that very&#xD;
man as a hitting terror to unloose upon Captain&#xD;
Brion's larty, but his evil thought has reacted&#xD;
on him ; yonder he lies lifeless, translated in a&#xD;
moment from this world to the other, with his&#xD;
sins upon him-with his many unrepented sins&#xD;
weighing darkly upon him."&#xD;
Mign'o" paused, arrested possibly by the&#xD;
thought that thesame peril attended her, wher-&#xD;
ever she might wander in the mountains.&#xD;
" Did you remark, Balaam, that the half-&#xD;
breed was cinnh affected by fear ? I recognized&#xD;
him immediately, as one of the three men in&#xD;
the service of Mariot-one of the trio from&#xD;
whose rudeness I was saved by the brave moun-&#xD;
taineer. Not long since I confounded him with&#xD;
another, who was a better man, undoubtedly."&#xD;
"Dere, missy, I'se forgot sev'ral 'portant&#xD;
'tic'lars !" exclaimed Balsam, without heeding&#xD;
Mignon's last remarks. " Here's our tent and&#xD;
baggage ; can't get along 'thout 'em."&#xD;
"I know they are useful, but necessity com-&#xD;
pels us to leave them."'&#xD;
The black looked around and shook his head&#xD;
-equivalent to a declaration that he must have&#xD;
them at any risk. Mignon gave him to under-&#xD;
stand that she would confide the matter whol-&#xD;
ty to his discretion, having unshaken faith in&#xD;
his prudence.&#xD;
"And now," she resumed, "is itnot time for&#xD;
me to go?"&#xD;
Balaama went out and reconnoitered once&#xD;
more, corning back with the report that there&#xD;
was a fair prospect of success, as the attention&#xD;
of the baul was still directed to the subject of&#xD;
Grenier's death ; while Mariotand Callard were&#xD;
yet talking earnestly-as he learned, by listen-&#xD;
ing in the vicinity of the parties.&#xD;
" I hate to have ye try it," said Balaam,&#xD;
causee it's dangerous-like, and dare no know-&#xD;
in' what'll happen; but if ye've made up yer&#xD;
mind to it, why, I s'pose you must. De Lord&#xD;
know what'll come ob all dis, for I doesn't ;&#xD;
but I'll stick to ye long as I've de breff ob life.&#xD;
Now,'go and manage it de best ye can,'and I'll&#xD;
watch yer as long as I can see ye." '&#xD;
Mignon left the tent ; a single glance over&#xD;
the encampment assured her that the moment&#xD;
was favorable. Moving quickly, her figure&#xD;
was soon lost to salaam's view in the shadow&#xD;
of the hill, at the base of which lay the valley.&#xD;
&#xD;
Five minutes after, he saw her near the cotton.&#xD;
woods, amii was certain she would reach it&#xD;
without discovery, whieh she did.&#xD;
It was then two hours past rnidnight  The&#xD;
moon was vaning, and thestar's seemed tc look&#xD;
down through a mist of silver. The mountains&#xD;
were grin1 anti cold, the snows on their sum-&#xD;
mits gleatning faintly and wierdly in the pale&#xD;
light.&#xD;
To Mignon's imagination the view appeared&#xD;
like giant castles, with lofty towers, gh tumty&#xD;
bastions, and rugged turrets. The defiles were&#xD;
moats, spanned by drawbridges kept by genii.&#xD;
Feelings of awe stole upon Mignon as she cast&#xD;
her eyes towards those mighty barriers. The&#xD;
mightiness of Nature, the grandeur of htr works,&#xD;
humbled her heart. The everfamished prairie-&#xD;
dogs fled at her advance, stopping at a little dis-&#xD;
tance to look back and redouble their cries ;&#xD;
while occasionally, in the distance, a troop of&#xD;
wolves howled their hideous notes. Though&#xD;
inured to these sounds, Mignon-now that she&#xD;
was alone-if not absolutely terrified, was&#xD;
startled and nervous. There followed her also&#xD;
an unpleasant remembrance of what had oc-&#xD;
cnrred that night directly before her, as well as&#xD;
incidents of a similar nature that had happened&#xD;
in Brion's band. As others had asked, so did&#xD;
Mignon, "0Who is Red path ?"&#xD;
Her better judgment told her that Redpath&#xD;
was asavage, cunning and deadly. and that&#xD;
was all. But why were his movements so&#xD;
secret, his step so noiseless, his approaches so&#xD;
mysterious ? Easy questions tooanswer.  He&#xD;
was secret because success depended upon se-&#xD;
crecy;his step noiseless, for the reason that he&#xD;
adopted extraordinary precautions; his ap-&#xD;
proaches mysterious, as the combined result of&#xD;
long practice and skill.  Red path, then, was&#xD;
but a stealthy Indian, more ma evolent than&#xD;
his brethren . hence, more terrible. He was&#xD;
daring, persevering tand adroit ; but perhap he&#xD;
might yet find an adversary as daring, perse-&#xD;
vering, and adroit as he. He was but a savage,&#xD;
daubed with 'paint, and full of subtlety; lie&#xD;
would doubtless fall, ultimately, by the ball of&#xD;
an American woodsman, and his name and&#xD;
fame only survive.&#xD;
Thus reflected Mignon, trying to suppress&#xD;
those fears which were natural to the time and&#xD;
place, and in which something very like super-&#xD;
stition blended. Say what we may to the con-&#xD;
trary, the strongest minds have an undereur-&#xD;
rent of superstition, and the sturdiest scotters&#xD;
at the marvellous find a substratum of super-&#xD;
uaturalisn in their souls. This is a truism that&#xD;
:he-" atheist's laugh" and the infidel's ridicule&#xD;
cannot overthrow. It is a good thing for man&#xD;
that there is such a susceptibility within him ;&#xD;
it is the only avenue through which to con-&#xD;
vince him of theexistence of a Supreme Power,&#xD;
and a conscious life hereafter  Mignon formed&#xD;
no exception to the general body of humanity,&#xD;
in this respect; and though the-name of Red.&#xD;

&#xD;
path had at first presented as a fabled terror,&#xD;
she shared, unconsciously ahnost, in the pre-&#xD;
vaarlirn. entiment of the trappers, hunters and&#xD;
voyagenrs-that Redpath was being some-&#xD;
what between human and devilish.,,-&#xD;
Near the cotton-woods where she wasto-wait&#xD;
the coming of Balaan, 'was a crevasse or gully,&#xD;
the entranee- to which _wars more deeply pic-&#xD;
tured in shadow.  Its slides were jagged and&#xD;
high, worn anrrad torn (formerly) by a strong&#xD;
Streak of water that tumbled from tire lower&#xD;
ranges in a season of rain. At. the top, at the&#xD;
Very ediges of the crevasse, their roots exposed&#xD;
and rotbbrei of soil, stood some trees of pinon,&#xD;
cyprss, aid birch, bending their sickly toips&#xD;
over the claim. The place, lonely and sombre&#xD;
as it was, appeared to off -r to Mignon a safe&#xD;
retreat until the black should join her. With&#xD;
a step that faltered, lacking its wonred firm-&#xD;
ness, she pussel into the gloom of the crevasse.&#xD;
It was cooler there-the night wind breathing&#xD;
through as it crept front tie hills. Walking&#xD;
on, she came to a deep dell or basin -a spot of&#xD;
rare obscurity-of which  we have had occa-&#xD;
sion to speak. Beyond were a series of eleva-&#xD;
tions extiading to the base of the Wind River&#xD;
chain of tire Rocky Mountains.  -&#xD;
Migron paused in that solitude.. How com-&#xD;
plete was he' isolation ! she seemed alone on&#xD;
the face of the globe, or the only inhabitant off&#xD;
a new world. ifrndreds of miles distant were&#xD;
the falarihrar olbjeets of childhood, scenes indeli-&#xD;
bly impressed ii mrenory, home, with its ten-&#xD;
der associaitiorns and kindred beloved. - Why'&#xD;
was she in that isolation ? Why had she cast'&#xD;
aside the trammels orf her -sex, and betaken to&#xD;
such a quixotic adventure ? Tosave her father&#xD;
frotni participation in crime, and to secure, if&#xD;
prasible, the safety of Captair Brion, was the&#xD;
never varying response w which be gave to those&#xD;
questions.  Her father's name always care&#xD;
first, afterward Brioii's; that order agreed better&#xD;
witr lher delicacy. How would the sententious&#xD;
world interpret all this ? the world with such&#xD;
a severe rense of decorum-the world which&#xD;
reaches just as far as one's name and fame, and&#xD;
no further-aill beyond being a blank !&#xD;
Fear not !" said a voice.&#xD;
Mignon recoiled and cried out in -alarm; be?&#xD;
side her stoodit a tall and motionless figure.&#xD;
" Be not afraid, pale-face."&#xD;
The speaker was an Indian of majestic height.&#xD;
Win h his arms folded upon his breast, he stood&#xD;
looking calmly at Mignon.&#xD;
"Stand up like a man, and do not tremble&#xD;
like a \vorman. Ravenelaw strikes notsuch as&#xD;
thou !  Thy chin is smooth, thy heart is soft,&#xD;
and there is no power in thy arm to harm my&#xD;
race.'"&#xD;
The voice of the red man was deep and mu-&#xD;
sical; it 'erme from his broad chest without&#xD;
effort. His eyes were dark and .piercing as&#xD;
those of the eagle ; it seemed to Mignon that&#xD;
she became transparent before him, ad he had&#xD;
&#xD;
to look at her only, to see what was passing&#xD;
within. His bearing was diginified to a notable&#xD;
degree   He spoke the English as though it&#xD;
been his vergRcular.&#xD;
" The vagabond prairie-dog has a home, the&#xD;
fox a covert, and the wild wolf s whelp a den ;&#xD;
but thou. 0 son of a mighty nation, art shel-&#xD;
terless," added the Indian.&#xD;
1" Take'the goat from the mountains, the huf-&#xD;

You say well : you speak accord  g to Na-&#xD;

of thie eagle, why I am in the courntry which&#xD;
the Master of Life has given to the red man,"&#xD;
replied Migrion, re-aasrrred by the lofty yet&#xD;
kindly anner of the native.&#xD;
itavetrelaw walked a few paces from Mignon,&#xD;
and addressed some one in his own dialect:&#xD;
immediately she heard steps lhrrrr'ying away.&#xD;
Ravernclaw returned to his former iiaee ; but,&#xD;
its he did not speak. she followed ris exiarmple.&#xD;
In a short tire-it was long to Mignonr-an&#xD;
Indian woman appeared with a hirnlle.&#xD;
" Follow her, and do as she bds you," sail&#xD;
Ravenelaw, pointing to the woman ; he then&#xD;
spoke to the latter in his own trrgue, who,&#xD;
making a gesture to M igon, proreedled to&#xD;
cross the dell. There, Nicnon perceived -a&#xD;
lut, and entered it, in obedience to the signs&#xD;
of her guide. The woman lighted a pine torch&#xD;
by some embers that were glowirrg upon a&#xD;
hearth of stone.  Thrusting the rd of the&#xD;
torch into the earth, she unrolled the iuidle.&#xD;
The maiden's cheek crimsoned! tie handle&#xD;
contained feriale wearing apparel, of Indian&#xD;
style, which might have belonged to an Indian&#xD;
belle, so elaborately was it made, and so taste-&#xD;
fully ornamented with those products esteeri&#xD;
graceful and becoming by tawny dames and&#xD;
red damsels.&#xD;
The Blackfoot woman pointed to Mignon's&#xD;
clothes, and .said, " Take off;" then to the&#xD;
garrnents which she had brought, and aded,&#xD;
Put on."&#xD;
The eyes of Ravenclaw had penetrate her&#xD;
disguise. Was her artitice so tra nsparent to&#xD;
this son of the mountains ? Had Nature indeed&#xD;
gifted him with keener instincts thiiri the chill&#xD;
of cities, the pampered creature of civiliza-&#xD;
tion ? Was she a prisoner?  What were his&#xD;
intentions?  Snh queries ran rapidly through&#xD;
her mind, while mechanically she obeyed the&#xD;
commands of the woman.&#xD;
A notable change was soon made in Mig-&#xD;
non's appearance, and one that was far from&#xD;
displeasing. We cannot picture fully to the&#xD;
reader's. imagination the effect of this novel&#xD;

Indian art), or note the various articles of&#xD;
which it was conmpus-d-nor is itneedful. We&#xD;
will s:ty, however, en passant, that Mignon's&#xD;
small foot did not look less pretty for the sub-&#xD;
stitution of a more elegant moccasin, nor her&#xD;
ankle less dainty for the fringed leggins. Her&#xD;
toilet was not considered complete till her&#xD;
cheeks were stained with paint, and her hands&#xD;
also. The woman then spread some skins&#xD;
upon the ground before-the tent, and Raven-&#xD;
claw. seeing her with Mignon, approached.&#xD;
-Daughter of the pale-face," he said, "I am&#xD;
of a warlike race, but I do not war upon&#xD;
women. Now, tell me why you are here ? I&#xD;
will listen--my ears are open."&#xD;
Mignon understood at once that the wishes&#xD;
of the man ih whose pi'esence she stood were&#xD;
comiandls, and not to be disregarded.&#xD;
It were better," she answered, with tact,&#xD;
"that I remain silent before a great chief and&#xD;
a iiighty warrior, as thy lofty hearing pro-&#xD;
elaios thee to be. I have called thee son of&#xD;
the eagle, because the eagle is a noble bird,&#xD;
with a daring spirit, proud plumage,'and eyes&#xD;
t hat ire not dazzled by the sun. Passon,thou&#xD;
of the sir'ong wing, nor stoop in thy flight to&#xD;
norine the sparrow that flies not so high, nor&#xD;
emoates thy deeds."&#xD;
" 1 said my ears were open ; they are, but I&#xD;
hear nothing. - Are you speaking, Lilyface ?"&#xD;
he said, somewhat haughtily.&#xD;
"You have called me Lilyface, because the&#xD;
pale blood of my nation betrays itself in my&#xD;
countenance. It is a good name-I like it; I&#xD;
will teach my people to call me thus, should I&#xD;
live to return. Listen, chief: the lodge of&#xD;
Lil y-face is away on the- border, with a h-&#xD;
dred prairies and rivers between. She has&#xD;
journeyed many days to reach the hunting-&#xD;
grounds of the Blackfoot. You have asked&#xD;
why she came t Keep your ears open, and&#xD;
you shall hear."&#xD;
Mignon, in that style pleasing to an Indian's&#xD;
fancy, acquangted him with those particulars&#xD;
which influenced her movements. She spoke&#xD;
of Brion; described the character of Pierre&#xD;
Mariot, finally  unfolding his entire plan.&#xD;
.Ravenclaw remained calm and unmoved ;&#xD;
while Mignon watched his face in vain to note&#xD;
the effect of her story. The incidents of the&#xD;
march were not passed over, but related in&#xD;
their appropriate connection. When she fin-&#xD;
ished, Ravenclaw was in possession of the more&#xD;
important matters contained in the foregoing&#xD;
pages.&#xD;
" A curse is upon your nation," said Raven-&#xD;
claw. "That curse is the love of yellow dust;&#xD;
it turns them into greedy wolves ; they howl&#xD;
and tear each other, and are never at rest.&#xD;
They die by the way ; their graves lie along&#xD;
the line of march, It is well; the-Great Spirit&#xD;
has sent it upon them. They tremble at the&#xD;
name of Red path-his deeds strike them dumb;&#xD;
they become as women-they grow pale,.like,&#xD;
&#xD;
squaws, when the avenger is abrul--wh .r&#xD;
the silent feet of the unknown posues----wlien&#xD;
his steps are in the mountains, and in the d.&#xD;
files. Lily-face, so perish thy race!''&#xD;
" And wherefore?" asked Mignon.&#xD;
"Because they are pushing~ us over the&#xD;
mountains into the sea. Fish live in the sa.&#xD;
but men cannot. But we have turned on oir&#xD;
pursuers like the hunted bulfltio, ind will go&#xD;
over the snowy ranges, fighting andbleediig,&#xD;
and staining the cliffs with'blood  Outr old-&#xD;
men may  ie, and be buried in sight of t he&#xD;
glorious hunting-ground of the Blackfoot ia-&#xD;
tion ; but our young men and our children w ill&#xD;
fall in arms, or perish ignobly by the sounding&#xD;
shores of the great waters."&#xD;
Mignon looked earnestly at Ravenclaw. and&#xD;
believed that the prophet-heart was beating in&#xD;
his swelling bosomn.&#xD;
" Home and country are as sacred to the red,&#xD;
man as the white. Tihere is but one God, Lily-&#xD;
face, and he is as much the God of the Indian&#xD;
as the white man," added Ravenclaw, in tunes&#xD;
that thrilled Mignon.&#xD;
"You are-right !" she exclaimed. " You are&#xD;
my brother ; there is but one humanity, one&#xD;
people, one race. The soul of a hero tales&#xD;
from your eyes ; the voice of truth slpeakhis&#xD;
through you ; the cause of the Indian is juit&#xD;
Yes, Ravenclaw, you are leaving a fair hiit-&#xD;
age-it is slipping from you ; your way is, in-&#xD;
deed, over the mountains-your -children's&#xD;
graves will be the sea."&#xD;
" And the great and awful Master of Life&#xD;
will avenge us on a proud and rapacious na-&#xD;
tion 1" cried Ravenclaw, with revereiitial f'r-&#xD;
vor. "He will smite your people-he wilt&#xD;
sweep them away with the power of his&#xD;
mighty aria. He will remember the wrgs&#xD;
of the red man long after the red man has ta-&#xD;
come extinct; and, in his tremendous wralIi,&#xD;
he will arise and shake heaven and earth ; your&#xD;
stars shall fall, and your bloody eagle shall&#xD;
shriek for help !"&#xD;
Ravenclaw stretched out his hand, and his&#xD;
expression-was sublime. Mignon was awed ;&#xD;
she felt a compassion for the red race that&#xD;
noved her to tears.&#xD;
" You dowell to weep, daughter of a doomed&#xD;
people; even warriors have dropped tears like&#xD;
women, and wiped them from their faces with&#xD;
bloody hands."&#xD;
Ravenclaw's arm fellto his side, his chin sunk&#xD;
upon his breast, and lie stood panting fotr&#xD;
breath,; another pang would have broken his&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
Mignon did not speak--she dared not inter.&#xD;
rupt a grief so sublime. She waited for his&#xD;
kingly spirit to grow calm. When lie ad-&#xD;
dressed her again, his emotion had subsided,&#xD;
and his tones were subdued to kindnesA, almost&#xD;
tenderness.&#xD;

Brion's camp was astir very early in the morn-&#xD;
bg. The hunt was to be resumed, and the iunt-&#xD;
ers wished to be seasonably in the saddle&#xD;
Headley and his party, excited by their new&#xD;
hopes and schemes, were among the first to&#xD;
awake. They had dreamed of a golden harvest,&#xD;
and the "Casa Montezuma."     The partisan&#xD;
had not betaken to his blanket until nearly&#xD;
daylight, and weary with his vigils, he was&#xD;
yet slumbering.&#xD;
Mariot was not to be seen. The gold-seek-&#xD;
ers, drawn together by sympathy of feehing,&#xD;
were cooking their breakfast very amicably.&#xD;
inquiries were made respecting the absence o&#xD;
- the grand projector of the new enterprise-&#xD;
IHeadley only appearing undisturbed by thecir-&#xD;
cumstance, he was very naturally looked to for&#xD;
light upon the subject.&#xD;
"He left us last night," said Headley, in a low&#xD;
tone. "le came to see me before he went, and&#xD;
instructed me what to do. ' If I don't return,'&#xD;
he said,' before morning, you need .not expect&#xD;
me, but fall back to the Red Buttes with as&#xD;
many as have the courage to follow you, where&#xD;
we will arrange everything to mutual satisfac&#xD;
tion.' This was what he told me."  -&#xD;
Headley arose with a determined look.&#xD;
"I am.one that goes, who will follow ?" he&#xD;
added, glancing inquiringly at his friends.&#xD;
" Let us go for our horses,'said Conroy.&#xD;
"Agreed, agreed !" cried a dozen voices.&#xD;
"NTo the Red Buttes-to the Red Buttes I"&#xD;
Buckeye was passing the malcontents, and&#xD;
heard enough to understand what was going&#xD;
forward ; he ran and aroused Brion from sleep.&#xD;
"Come, cap'n, it's time for you to act ; the&#xD;
Headley and Dorelle party are deserting."&#xD;
Brion was instantly upon 'his feet and walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
49&#xD;
&#xD;
and assumed, a sterner expression. Mignon&#xD;
took a ring from her finger; and placing it in&#xD;
his hand, said :&#xD;
" It is the gift of Lilyface-keep it "&#xD;
Ravenclaw held the glittering jewel between&#xD;
his thumb and finger.&#xD;
a This will be more precious to me than my&#xD;
life," he replied. " Iwill wear it on my breast,&#xD;
where it shall feel the motion of tay heart as&#xD;
long as it beats. It shall be with me when I&#xD;
sleep and when I awake ; it shall- gowith me&#xD;
to battle, my hands shall grasp it when I die.&#xD;
In years to come, should the plough of 'the&#xD;
white man disturb my bones, they will cast up&#xD;
this gift. And now go, go ! You shsh hear no&#xD;
more the voice of Ravenclaw."-&#xD;
Mignon hastened away ; at the distance of a&#xD;
few paces she paused and waved her hand, but&#xD;
Ravenclaw stood immovable, and made no&#xD;
sign.&#xD;

" Ain't you gom' tocall out some of the men&#xD;

" No, I can help myself !" said the parti an,&#xD;
firmly.&#xD;
He found Headley bridling a horse, and&#xD;
others preparing to do the same.&#xD;
" Men," said Brion, "these animals belong&#xD;

Headley was confused.&#xD;
" What!" he exclaimed, "lave we not ridt&#xD;

"So you have had the light of the moon, but&#xD;
I think you do not own the nmoan," replied&#xD;
Brion, quietly.&#xD;
" We have ridden these animals, we have&#xD;
called them outs, we have groomed and cared&#xD;
for them, and we shall take them !" rejoined&#xD;
Headley, raising the saddle from the ground.&#xD;

Headley, to his adherents.&#xD;

Saith ! but jsn't it sing'lar ?"&#xD;
"She sisgrtacefuiy, i sure," said Brion.&#xD;
"As a queen !" quoth Buckeye.&#xD;
.If the appearance of the Indian maiden pro -&#xD;
duced such a marked effect-upon Buckeye,&#xD;
what must have been the emotions of Brion,&#xD;
who believed that in her he recognized the face&#xD;
and form of Mignon ? The wonderful diselo-&#xD;
sures of the previous night had prepared the&#xD;
way to such a recognition. Having seen the&#xD;
features of Balaam, he was not one to forget&#xD;
them ; and he was well, assured, by the few&#xD;
words he heard him utter on that occasion,&#xD;
that he would never be found far from his&#xD;
young mistress. The bosom of the mountain-&#xD;
eer was agitated by doubt, love, fear, admira-&#xD;
tion.  Mignon 'approached, while Balaam&#xD;
checked his horse and fell in the rear. When&#xD;
near enough, she raised her eyes, and asked:&#xD;
" Is not this Captain Brion, the partisan of&#xD;
the American Fur Company ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said trion, respectfully.&#xD;
"I have that to say which must be my ex-.&#xD;
cuse for appearing before you in this garb, and&#xD;
under circumstances so peculiar," she added,&#xD;
averting her eyes, her cheeks becoming sud-&#xD;
denly suffused.&#xD;
Brion's brave heart Teat rapidly.  The mo-&#xD;
desty and heroism of Mignon charmed him&#xD;
He thought of what she had done, and the&#xD;
dangers she had dared. And for what had she&#xD;
tempted such perils?  The query came with&#xD;
stunning force. What but love makes woman&#xD;
bold ?        -&#xD;
" You need no excuse for appearing before&#xD;
Ben Brion," he replied, with warmth. "Your&#xD;
wishes shall be my commands; you have only&#xD;
to name them. I beg of you to be frank, and&#xD;
trust me as if we had) met and established an&#xD;
acquaintance."&#xD;
Mignon looked inquiringly at the partisan&#xD;
to learn if his words had other significance&#xD;
than what they seemed to have upon their sur-&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"My communications will consist simply of&#xD;
vague warnings, which I fear will appear inde-&#xD;
finite and unsatisfactory," Mignon resumed.&#xD;
" Such apprehenlions do injustice to my na-&#xD;
ture," said Brion.&#xD;
"So I shall endeavor to persuade - myself,"&#xD;
continued Mignon, with captivating ingenuous-&#xD;
ness. "I love to think well of humanity ; I&#xD;
have pleasure in seeing poor human nature ex-&#xD;
alted.  I will-to employ a Jewish simile--&#xD;
deal .frankly and truly with thee, though it&#xD;
may cost me pain and confusion. You won-&#xD;
der why I am here ; it is to warn you of the&#xD;
danger of which I have spoken, this is why I&#xD;
am before you."&#xD;
" For me !" exclaimed Brion, astounded at&#xD;
such a declaration.&#xD;
" Hear me ; the danger which threatened&#xD;
&#xD;
you compromised the honor of ae who it&#xD;
dear to me," rejoined Mignon.&#xD;
If the declaration she had first made filled,&#xD;
him with hope, the, last avoval dispelled it.&#xD;
One who was " dear to her!"  Alh, tiat must&#xD;
be a lover or a husband!I&#xD;
"You are the victim of a wicked scheme,&#xD;
which has for its object the destruction of your&#xD;
party. The man to whomi belongs the pater&#xD;
nity of this plot, will not fail through softness&#xD;
of heart or scruples of conscience."&#xD;
"May I ask his name ?"&#xD;
" I cannot tell you-it would involve at -&#xD;
other. If I can defeat him without exposing&#xD;
him, I will."&#xD;
" He is Pierre Mariot," said Brion.&#xD;
Mignon grew pale.&#xD;
"It is too true," she answered "You have&#xD;
discovered the secret."&#xD;
"I even know you," resumed the mouutainl-&#xD;
eer.&#xD;
Mignon looked up in alarm.&#xD;
" Will you speak my name ?" she added.&#xD;
" Mademoiselle Bellmar; those to whom&#xD;
friendship gives the right to address you fa-&#xD;
miliarly, call you Mignon."&#xD;
Mignon's face became crimson. A lovelier&#xD;
countenance could not have been presented to&#xD;
the gaze of the mountaineer. His sympathies.&#xD;
his love, his soul itself, seemed to pass over to&#xD;
Mignon.   He idealized her perfections, he&#xD;
spiritualized her beauty. The conquest which&#xD;
began at Westport, was now complete. Mig-&#xD;
non became all that was divine in woman.&#xD;
Brion wished to kneel at her feet and do ho-&#xD;
mage.                             0&#xD;
" You are right," she responded, pensively.&#xD;
" And do you remember that we once met ?"&#xD;
"Well, it was at night; you laid ue- under&#xD;
obligations which I shall not forget."&#xD;
" And did you imagine that I could forget.,&#xD;
Mademoiselle Bellmar ? Pardon my boldness,&#xD;
but your.idea has been with me ever since. I&#xD;
have thought of you on the march-I have&#xD;
dreamed of you while sleeping on the prairies.&#xD;
And you are here before me! Oh ! this cannot&#xD;
be reality--this is the veriest hallucination !"&#xD;
At first,.Brion fixed his eyes on the maiden's&#xD;
face, but, startled at his own temerity, he al-&#xD;
lowed them to pink till they rested upon Mig-&#xD;
non's little foot. Mademoiselle felt the blood&#xD;
glowing in her cheeks, and dancing through&#xD;
her swelling veins preternaturally quick.&#xD;
" There will be time for gallant speeches&#xD;
when we meet under different circumstances,"&#xD;
she resumed, with dignity, casting off her wo-&#xD;
manly weakness.&#xD;
"I crave pardon; but I never speak what I&#xD;
do not mean."&#xD;
," And what is it that you mean?" she asked,&#xD;
with asperity.&#xD;
- "Since you are offended, I dare not confess.&#xD;
It were more becoming to thank you for the&#xD;
undeserved exertions you have made in nmy be.&#xD;

half. Mademoiselle, I know not how to clothe&#xD;
my feelings of gratitude in words."&#xD;
"I will spare you the trouble," said Mignon,&#xD;
with a smile, extending her hand to him.&#xD;
" I swear, by this hand, to be the most de-&#xD;
voted of your friends--to sacrifice life, every-&#xD;
thing. to secure your safety."&#xD;
" That is much, and unasked, too ; for I did&#xD;
not come like love-torn damsel seeking adven-&#xD;
turous knight."&#xD;
Mignon pronounced these words with a smile&#xD;
on her lips, but in a tonesomewhat indicative&#xD;
Of injured pride, which'the partisan did not&#xD;
fail to notice.&#xD;
"   c cherish no thoughts 'or feelings not to&#xD;
your favor," he said, quickly. "I entertain&#xD;
for you the profoundest respect. Nevpr, I&#xD;
trust, will you have reason to blush for word,&#xD;
or act of mine, or regret the step you have&#xD;
taken to ward off pressing danger. Chance&#xD;
has already made me acquainted with the na-&#xD;
ture of the peril that impends. Mariot'is in-&#xD;
deed a villain, and it is truly unfortunate that&#xD;
a man like Monsieur Bellmar, your father-&#xD;
of w hose name I have heard honorable men-&#xD;
ti,-should be connected with him in busi-&#xD;
- tone can regret itmore deeply than I; it&#xD;
ai orig been a source of pain,"&#xD;
" 1 am willing to absolve Monsieur Bellmar&#xD;
from all participation in this scheme for the&#xD;
destruction of my band, and the injury of my&#xD;
employers."&#xD;
-- You do him no more than justice; he is&#xD;
anxious that the designs of Mariot should come&#xD;
to niaught."            .&#xD;
 He was acquainted with those designs, it&#xD;
would seem ?"&#xD;
11 ignon was embarrassed; she withheld a&#xD;
por; ion of the truth to screen hime from the im-&#xD;
putationm of guilt.&#xD;
" I  tcaned to hear," she said, " a conversa-&#xD;
tiont it inten-ied for my ears, which made me&#xD;
a parry to his purposes. Being in possession&#xD;
of his secret, it was natural Ishould disclose it&#xD;
to mve father "&#xD;
" Very true," said Brion, "and for his sake&#xD;
I doubt not you have accomplished this peril-&#xD;
ous pilgrimage."&#xD;
' res, it is so ; you construe me truly and&#xD;
generously. I would do much rather than&#xD;
have my father's name linked with infamy."&#xD;
- That expression does you much honor, and&#xD;
raises you still higher in my esteem. Having&#xD;
done ail you can do, it is probable that you&#xD;
wish to return ; is it so ?"&#xD;
" I put myself under your protection until&#xD;
I shall be so fortunate as to meet a party re-&#xD;
turning from the mountains, then I snal go&#xD;
back."&#xD;
"To afford you every assistance in my&#xD;
power will be but a meagre testimonial of myt&#xD;
gratitude. I have duties to perform requiring&#xD;
&#xD;
my immediate attention ; but I will first con&#xD;
duct-you to camp."&#xD;
"Is it far, captain ?"&#xD;
" You see yonder hill; it is at the right of&#xD;
that."&#xD;
" Then I need not trouble you to go back ;&#xD;
Balaam will easily find.it."&#xD;
Brion demurred at this, arrangement, but&#xD;
Mignon was firm-insisting that the way was&#xD;
short, and their acquaintsidee should not com-&#xD;
menee with taking him from his duties"&#xD;
"Besides," she added, looking kindly at IiS&#xD;
black, " Balaam is as good as a regiment.' 'B-&#xD;
laam was flattered ; shaking his brawny urm.&#xD;
he declared himself a "host" in the defence of&#xD;
his mistress.&#xD;
" There's a cretur among us," quoth Buck-&#xD;
eye, "that none of us can guard against."&#xD;
" Redpath?" said Mignon.&#xD;
"That's the nat'ral varmint I mean," re-&#xD;
turned Buckeye.&#xD;
"I do not fear Redpath, even; I wear a&#xD;
charm," Mignon rejoined.&#xD;
" You wear a good many charms, miss, that&#xD;
are jes' calkilated to turn a feller's head e'ena.-&#xD;
most," Buckeye replied, casting afurtive glance&#xD;
at the partisan.&#xD;
"I refer to a special charm," resumed Mig-&#xD;
non, blushing, ".which will guard me in the&#xD;
hour of danger."&#xD;
"For me there's no charm like your beauty,&#xD;
miss, and to protect that, I'd stan' afore an army&#xD;
of savage riptjps like Redpath."&#xD;
" Oh, you are sincere, I'm sure 1 so I thank&#xD;
you, and will proceed."&#xD;
" Remember directions-bear well to the&#xD;
right. If no accident occurs, I will be with&#xD;
you soon."  Then, to Balaam: "Tell my men&#xD;
that you met their leader, and he expects thent&#xD;
to treat this young lady with respeet."&#xD;
Yes, massa, I'll spoke dat to 'em." said Ba.&#xD;
laam.&#xD;
"I was correct," affirmed Buckeye. when&#xD;
Mignon was out of hearing, "about the black&#xD;
hoss."&#xD;
"'I think you were, really," Brion replied.&#xD;
" One thing I should like to know," added&#xD;
the trapper.&#xD;
"Well?"&#xD;
"The youngster's name that used to rile&#xD;
the cretur which now carries that dusky hea-&#xD;
then."&#xD;
" Crevier.  Confess that you did not like&#xD;
him ?"&#xD;
"He appeared foppish; but between you and&#xD;
I, I mistrusted that it was a woman the minute&#xD;
I put my eyes on him.     -&#xD;
'".I cannot give you credit, for so much per-&#xD;
spicacity. Had you been suspicious of her&#xD;
sex. your bearing would have been less relpul-&#xD;
sive. Your gallantry I cannot doubt,, since&#xD;
you passed your compliments upon yonder&#xD;
young lady so adroitly. If you go on in that&#xD;
&#xD;
way, by my faith, Buckeye, you will prove a&#xD;
dangerous rival!"&#xD;
The trapper drew up his shoulhrs signifi-&#xD;
cantly.&#xD;
".ilidr'k mean you should get ahead of me,&#xD;
caprn, though you're very fluent in speech;&#xD;
but by the heard of Smith! you made a plump&#xD;
declaration I"&#xD;
" I hope I was not guilty of such folly," said&#xD;
Brion, lting his lip.&#xD;
"'That oncomrnon cretur would make any&#xD;
man commit iridiscretions, cap'n. Them eyes&#xD;
of hern-l shine afore tme for the next twenty-&#xD;
founr hours like di'imons. Ani perhaps you&#xD;
did n't notice the little foot, no longer than a&#xD;
dolls ?'&#xD;
Perhaps not," said the mountaineer, drily.,&#xD;
" Her hauds are like fairies' hands," persist&#xD;
ed Buckeye&#xD;
"You are observing, my friend."&#xD;
"1And her smile is of a heavenly natur," said&#xD;
Buekey e, perseveringly.&#xD;
"-Be quiet; look yonder, just' where those&#xD;
bushes skirt the plateau and tell me if you see&#xD;
aught that is suspicious ?"&#xD;
" I see a motionless object, that seems, from&#xD;
this distance,'like a stick or a stone."&#xD;
" Watch it a moment."&#xD;
"It moves a little ; it's a riptile-one of&#xD;
the ouregenerate pa motions of this great ken-&#xD;
try I"&#xD;
" Let us move that way ; perchance we may&#xD;
stir up a nest of them. I have known one to&#xD;
stand like a fixture, while several of his com-&#xD;
utnions were concealed in the surrounding&#xD;
thickets. It may be thus in the present in-&#xD;
stance "&#xD;
Bentling somewhat to the left, that their ad-&#xD;
vanice rnigt he covered by an arm of timber&#xD;
reaching out into the prairie, the (wary trap-&#xD;
pers aIproached the suspicious object., which,&#xD;
after all, eight prove a wolf or a buffalo ; for&#xD;
the space intervening was yet considerable.&#xD;
Keeping a careful watch in every direction&#xD;
where they supposed it possible an enemy&#xD;
could hbe concealed, they soon turned the tim--&#xD;
ber; but that which had drawn their scrutiny&#xD;
was no longer in sight ; it had vanished in the&#xD;
wood, sank into the earth, or was hidden in&#xD;
the grass.&#xD;
"We were seen, you perceive," said Brion.&#xD;
"Our design was fathomed before we changed&#xD;
our course - But what is this upon this tree ?&#xD;
A human figure carved in the bark I"&#xD;
The mountaineers rode to the tree, and ex-&#xD;
amined the carving, which was yet fresh.&#xD;
",Not ten minutes have elapsed since the edge&#xD;
of the knife left these lines," said Brion.&#xD;
"Not five," said Buckeye. "The sap yet&#xD;
flows from the wounds. Now this wasn't made&#xD;
for nothin'; there's meanin' to it, as there is&#xD;
about everythin' an Ingin does."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Possibly it was cut merely for amusement,"&#xD;
replied the partisan.&#xD;
"No, sir; depend on't there's some deviltry&#xD;
in it."&#xD;
" The handiwork of Redpat.h," answered&#xD;
Brion, with a smile and an incredulous lIok.&#xD;
" It wouln'tbestrange, though l don't think&#xD;
the cretur finds time for tuch fancy-work of&#xD;
this particular description."   -&#xD;
" It strikes me; Buckeye, that you really fear&#xD;
this incomprehensible Redpath."&#xD;
".Fear is a word I don't'very much ike,.&#xD;
cap'n, even from you. I'll thank you to find&#xD;
the man who'll call me a coward to mv faee.&#xD;
As for Redpatli, he's like.nobwdy else--a sort&#xD;
of Ingin devil, that baffles the wisest of us ;&#xD;
but I'm  not afraid of him-no, not by no&#xD;
means; and in fact I should like to meet him&#xD;
face to face, as one brave man meets another.&#xD;
I would put a good American rifle-ball through&#xD;
his body ; I would kill him as I would a wolf,&#xD;
and his accursed art and mystery would perish&#xD;
with him."&#xD;
The mountainers were bending over their&#xD;
horses' necks, looking at the figure ; the air&#xD;
was slightly disturbed, and something passed&#xD;
between them and struck the object at which&#xD;
they were looking with a sharp concussiu.&#xD;
Both instinctively drew back--a long arrow&#xD;
was quivering in the tree. For a momnut,&#xD;
Brion was too much astonished to speak or to&#xD;
act.&#xD;
"By the beard of Smith!" said Buckeye.&#xD;
The sound of his voice aroused the partisan;&#xD;
putting spurs to his horse, he dashed toward&#xD;
the timber.&#xD;
"By heavens!" he muttered. "I will make&#xD;
an attetnpt to solve this mystery."&#xD;
He urged his horse into the wood. which,&#xD;
being free from underbush, offered but little im-&#xD;
pediment ; he galloped through and around it,&#xD;
and came back with his animal heated and&#xD;
foaming.&#xD;
" Why db you sit motionless?   Why not&#xD;
make an effort to find this invisible, archer ?"&#xD;
asked the.trapper.&#xD;
" A  sense of gratitude fastens me here,&#xD;
cap'n."&#xD;
"A  sense of gratitude?. I do not under-&#xD;
stand."&#xD;
" It is jes' here ; consider, and you'll. per-&#xD;
ceive that the arm that sent that shaft directly&#xD;
to the head of that figure, could as easily have&#xD;
sent it through your head or mine."&#xD;
" That is a very just conclusion, Buckeye. I&#xD;
(lid not pause to think of nice points ; but in-&#xD;
deed I could scarcely find it in my heart to&#xD;
draw a hair-sight on one, who, having my life&#xD;
in his power, did not take it. In this you have&#xD;
acted wisely. Yesthe eye that aimed that arrow&#xD;
could have aimed it at a human brain instead&#xD;
of an insentient one like that. What a narrow&#xD;
boundary lies between us and death I"&#xD;

"Scarcely wider than the edge of my bunt-&#xD;

Alh, Buckeye, we must travel that trail&#xD;

"A strange road-a strange road ! And it's&#xD;
been used a good deal. too."&#xD;
- Death is, at times, a cold and awful mys-&#xD;

" That isnot the nost cheerful belief imagin-&#xD;
able, but far better than a future of pain."&#xD;
While Brion was thus conversing, his hands&#xD;
were not idle; he was cutting the arrow from&#xD;
the tree ' with his hatchet--which, when ex-&#xD;
tracted. lie examined with a feeling of intense&#xD;
curio ity. The sharp, polished, tapering steel&#xD;
head. dtlientely small, the lang, smooth shaft&#xD;
attached. had for him a peculiar interest--con-&#xD;
nected as they were, with the fate of Town-&#xD;
send and Minten, Stringer and Grenier.&#xD;
"It is wondrously well wrought," he re-&#xD;
mirked&#xD;
,-A ud narveliously well-sped, toot" added&#xD;
13nekeye.&#xD;
'- I will keep it as a memento of Redpath."&#xD;
" Also to make you think, perhaps, that the&#xD;
rate to it is kept for you, and you will some&#xD;
time receive it."                      '&#xD;
The auon w as now near at hand, and as&#xD;
&#xD;
they drew in sight of it, the partisan saw a&#xD;
human form standing upon the summit of a&#xD;
high cliff, which he quickly pointed out to the&#xD;
trapper. The sun was shining upon the jagged&#xD;
elevation gloriously, making the figure appear&#xD;
as if clothed in garments of flarme  le gazed&#xD;
down upon the horsemen a moment, waved his&#xD;
hand, and disarpearld.&#xD;
Brien looked inquiringly at his companion.&#xD;
" It nay be the Evil One himself ; he shone&#xD;
like a pillar of fire !" suggested Buckeye.&#xD;
" His majesty has a majestic figure. then ?"&#xD;
" He can assume any shape, undoubtedly."&#xD;
The mountaineers entered the canon, and&#xD;
passed through it ; it sheltered no visible ene-&#xD;
my, and they turned their horses' heads toward&#xD;
the encampment of the previous night. Brion&#xD;
entirely absorbed in thought.&#xD;
" Do you know," said Buckeye, interrupting&#xD;
his reverie, " that Redpath is not the only one&#xD;
among us'that is dangerous? There is one&#xD;
who aims not at the head, but at the heart,&#xD;
and her arrows go straight as a rifle-ball."&#xD;
Brion writhed under the trapper's raillery,&#xD;
-but deemed it wisest to keep silent.&#xD;
"And yet this fair archer, though she doesn't&#xD;
aim at the head, affects the brain not a little&#xD;
with her pretty arrows, which are launched&#xD;
from her sparklin' eyes."&#xD;
The mountaineer confessed, internally, that&#xD;
there was truth in this metaphor, inasmuch as&#xD;
the insidiously wounding weapons of Mignon&#xD;
were vibrating beneath his hunting frock, at&#xD;
the very centre of a great and active muscle,&#xD;
which is indispensable to life.1&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
A SACRIFICE TO THE CORN-SPIRIT.&#xD;
Mignon and the black intended to follow the&#xD;
directions of Brion to the letter ; but notwith-&#xD;
standing his instructions to keep to the right,&#xD;
Balaam unwittingly took the left side of the&#xD;
h;i. They had made half the circuit of the hill&#xD;
before the consequences of their inattention&#xD;
were apparent. A vell recalled Balaam to the,&#xD;
outer waking work---rudely, it must be con-&#xD;
fessed, but effectually. Mignon wag the first&#xD;
to realize the misfortune that had befallen&#xD;
them. She perceived around her a'circle of&#xD;
dusky men, armed with spears, knives, and&#xD;
guns: she had fallen into an ambuscade of In-&#xD;
dians. The discovery was one to try the firm-&#xD;
est nerves. Balaam, seeing a red hand grasp&#xD;
his horse's bridle, thought it time to bestir&#xD;
himsel f ; with a sweep of-his long arm he felled&#xD;
the offender, then disengaging a small axe&#xD;
which was secured at his saddle, and in the use&#xD;
of which he was practiced, he struck down an-.&#xD;
other savage, and prepared for a sturdy defence&#xD;
of his mistress. Enraged at his resistance, they&#xD;
swarmed upon him in overwhelming numbers,&#xD;
with lp)ud, vindictive whoops.&#xD;
For s time the giant strength of the black&#xD;
prevailed, his weapon gleaming around him in&#xD;
rapid circles, scattering his foes ; but anon a&#xD;
hatchet hurled by a warrior took effect upon&#xD;
his head. The faithful negro cast a despairing&#xD;
look at Mignon, and lost his seat in the saddle ;&#xD;
but when upon the ground, he sprang up and&#xD;
shook himself like a lion; then even Mignon&#xD;
believed he might prove unconquerable . He&#xD;
struck a few blows, then sank upon one knee,&#xD;
yet continuing to resist and defy them in his&#xD;
own peculiar way. Perceiving that his strength&#xD;
was failing, he turned his eyes toward his be-&#xD;
loved mistress.&#xD;
" The red niggers bab fixed me-God bress&#xD;
ye, missy I" he said, and fell forward upon'his&#xD;
face. The infuriated savages would have man-&#xD;
gled and mutilated his body-=-but their chief&#xD;
&#xD;
commanded them to desist, adding-that cow-&#xD;
ards might be hacked and cut in pieces, but&#xD;
not brave men who sell their lives dearly.&#xD;
This humane Indian, however, did not waive&#xD;
the established usage of his race, and in a mo-&#xD;
ment held up poor Balaam's. scalp.  At the&#xD;
eight of this reeking trophy, Mignon swooned.&#xD;
When she recovered, she was seated at the foot&#xD;
of a tree, her body supported by the trunk.&#xD;
The natives were grouped together a few paces&#xD;
distant, speaking earnestly in their own dialect,&#xD;
which sounded harsh and horrible to Mignon.&#xD;
There seemed to be a division of opinion among&#xD;
them, which was finally settled, as she judged,&#xD;
by the altered tones of their voices. The chief&#xD;
came and looked at her attentively.&#xD;
" You wear," he said, in English so broken&#xD;
that we shall not attempt to give it verbatim,&#xD;
"the garb of a princess of the Blackfoot na-&#xD;
tion, but your skin is pale. The Blackfoot and&#xD;
the Crow are enemies ; they hate each other--&#xD;
they go to war and take scalps-they put their&#xD;
prisoners to death.  Pale faced woman, you&#xD;
must die I"&#xD;
" Do the warriors of the Crow nation wage&#xD;
war against women ?" asked Mignon, striving&#xD;
to rally her courage.&#xD;
" They destroy their enemies," returned the&#xD;
chief.&#xD;
" Enemies are those who take the war-path ;&#xD;
the women of the pale-face nation never go&#xD;
upon the war-path ; they love peace and re-&#xD;
main at home."&#xD;
" Then why art thou here ?" said the chief,&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
" Not to take life, but to save it," Mignon&#xD;
answered&#xD;
" Like all your craven race, you shrink from&#xD;
death."&#xD;
"And why should I not?  Am I not young,&#xD;
and does not the young heart cling to exis-&#xD;
tence ? Women die well when the Great Spirit&#xD;
calls ; but they draw back front violence and&#xD;
blood."&#xD;
." The Great Spirit calls you now."&#xD;
"I cannot hear him."&#xD;
"He calls you through my voice ; he bids&#xD;
you get ready."&#xD;

".I will ask him," said Mignon, closing he&#xD;
eyes and.crossing her arms upon her breast&#xD;
she remained silent a few moments, then a&#xD;
dressing the clief-&#xD;
"iThe answeris (looking steadily at Tallbear&#xD;

""Inquire yet again, and ask him what Isha&#xD;
do with the pale-face woman ?"&#xD;
Mignon perceived that all depended on th&#xD;
skillfulness of her reply ; she had reached th&#xD;
most delicate and critical point of her purpose&#xD;
She closed her' ey es, and crossed her arm&#xD;
again, to gain time to form a fitting answer.&#xD;
"Finu a wornarf arioong your people who ha&#xD;
lost a daughter, and let her adopt the child o&#xD;
the pale-face," she said.&#xD;
This reply was jprdicious, for the suspicion&#xD;
of Tallbear might have been aroused, had sh&#xD;
demanded her liberty at once.&#xD;
"I will send for our medicine-men, and the3&#xD;
shall fast three days and see if the Great Spiri&#xD;
will confirm this," returned the Indian.&#xD;
" The Master of Life speaks but once to man&#xD;
he never repeats !" exclaimed Mignon, with&#xD;
dignirv arid earnestness wondrous to Tallbear&#xD;
- ' That is well ; he never repeats," he said&#xD;
thenr I making searehingly at his captive, added&#xD;
4And he never denies!"&#xD;
"Anil he never denies," repeated Mignon, in&#xD;
the same tone.  " But it becomes the awfu&#xD;
lDeity to remain silent when he has once de.&#xD;
clarr-d his sovereign will to man.",&#xD;
"Speak again to the Great Spirit and ask if&#xD;

Shave done." she said ; "his presence is&#xD;
dep artinerr--hi chariot-wheels are,rolling over&#xD;
the" rsrrnrit-ring. Be content and humble. Speak&#xD;

ier back to Tallbear, and assumed her former&#xD;
silent arind hopeless attitude. Tallbear walked&#xD;
away, and sated himself apart from his braves,&#xD;
apparently in a thoughtful mood.&#xD;
In half aIiur the storm passed ; the rain&#xD;
ceased falling, the thunder was heard faintly&#xD;
rumbling at a great distance, while tre liht-&#xD;
nins blazedl against the far-off sky with dimin-&#xD;
ished- brightness.&#xD;
The party went on again, and in two house&#xD;
drew in sight of a Crow village in view of&#xD;
which theyhalted-it being their  uston wvie&#xD;
they had lost warriors rot to enter thr village&#xD;
on their return, without an invitation from the&#xD;
friends of the slain. Tse dogs gave notice of&#xD;
their approach, and in a short time the sleepy&#xD;
natives were astir, making suitable prepara-&#xD;
tions to receive their warriors, who, after con-&#xD;
siderable delay, were formally invited to enter&#xD;
the town. Mignon, though an object of much&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
is curiosity, was treated with respect. The tent&#xD;
which the unfortunate Balraam had succeeded&#xD;
er in securing when his mistress left Callard's en.&#xD;
; eampment, was taken from the horse, u pon&#xD;
d- which it had been carefully packed, and set  i&#xD;
for her exclusive use by Tallbear, wlho clearly&#xD;
), intended to treat her with distinction until her&#xD;
n- fate should be decided by the A-medicine-Men."&#xD;
rs   The latter were called together early in the&#xD;
morning.   The chief made them acquainted&#xD;
11 with his original intention of s-crificing Mig-&#xD;
non to placate the corn-spirit, with what sub-&#xD;
.e sequently occurred during the storm of thun-&#xD;
e der, and his own determination to refer th~s&#xD;
a. matter to those skilled in the ways of the in-&#xD;
s visible powers.&#xD;
"Now go," .he added, "and have lodges&#xD;
s built in some lonely spot, and fast according to&#xD;
if your custom, and thus learn the will f the&#xD;

accordingly withdrew to a lodge. which ev ry&#xD;
person was forbidden to approrcr  Pres-nit ly,&#xD;
' Mignon heard the sound of an Enlian drim,&#xD;
and frantic yells proceeding frorr the lo.s',&#xD;
and shuddered to think such w'retehes were to&#xD;
l decide her fate. They continued f(heir orgirs&#xD;
some hours-a period of dreadful anxiety to&#xD;
Mignon, w-ho, solitary in her tent, was await-&#xD;
f ing the conclusion of'the rites.&#xD;
Mignon's father was a Catholic ; hut she hail&#xD;
been educated in the Protestant religion,in har.-&#xD;
many with the views of her deceased eother-;&#xD;
and she now sought the cons nations of the&#xD;
Christian faith. Sire petitioned God with I hat&#xD;
contrite fervor that her condition wis so well&#xD;
calculated  to  .waken, seeking  that calin&#xD;
strength, 'that unshrinking fortitude, He only&#xD;
can impart.    .&#xD;
"Daughter of the pale face, come!" said a&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
.It was Tallbear who spoke ; he had come to&#xD;
conduct her to hear the verdict otte rsieniraine&#xD;
men. Shre found'tire Irndians assermblled sirsa&#xD;
plateau near the village, in close ne iirihorho, ii&#xD;
to a large field of corn. She followed winth&#xD;
modest and melanely mien . her sauty arid&#xD;
grace attracting much attention and rernark.&#xD;
-Thre medicine-men were in a circle, fosrmsed iry&#xD;
the principal men of the village; next ire lit-&#xD;
ter, were the braves ; while the third and last&#xD;
ring was composed of women and children--a&#xD;
motley, clamorous rabble.&#xD;
When Mignon reached the central circle.&#xD;
where the three prophets were awaiting her,&#xD;
Tallbear addressed them :&#xD;
" What," he asked, "says the Manito of the&#xD;
Crow Nation?"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
" That the love of life iu strong and all Wish&#xD;
to live to enjoy summer and, sunshine"&#xD;
Mignon heard the rejoinder, and though she&#xD;
had made up her mind for the worst, hope re-&#xD;
vived a little. "Summer and sunshine !"&#xD;
These words had a meaning they never before&#xD;
possessed. She could not refrain from raising&#xD;
her eyes toward the glorious luminary-the&#xD;
eternal lamp of Nature. The refulgent beams,&#xD;
gleamed as brightly upon her as in the days oft&#xD;
her childhood, before she understood the mean-&#xD;
ing of the word "death."   A gentle breeze&#xD;
from the West blew on her face and toyed with&#xD;
her hair.&#xD;
" O God!"'she exclaimed, " why can I not&#xD;
enjoy this forever ? Why hast thou placed the&#xD;
grave before mortals, and called them to a bap&#xD;
tism of pain ?"&#xD;
"6Go on," said Tallbear.&#xD;
"And he added, moreover," resumed the&#xD;
spokesman of the medicine-men, " that he&#xD;
speaketh in thunder and fire ; that he createth&#xD;
all things, and causeth the Indian corn to&#xD;
grow."&#xD;
" I am saved !" thought Mignon. '"God will&#xD;
spare my youth !'&#xD;
The prophet went on:&#xD;
"But lest' he might sometime forget the&#xD;
corn, he has given it in charge of a powerful&#xD;
spirit, whose duty it is to watch over it night&#xD;
and day. The pale-face woman has said that&#xD;
the Master of Life loveth not blood, but it&#xD;
was the God of the white man that told her&#xD;
so."&#xD;
"There is but one God 1" said Mignon,.who&#xD;
saw her last hope passing away.&#xD;
"The red man does not serve the God of the&#xD;
pale.-faces," returned the prophet. "Every&#xD;
nation has its deity, and no two are alike. 'We&#xD;
follow the voice of the Great Spirit, and no&#xD;
other will we hear. Behold what he has given&#xD;
us! Look at the boundless hunting-grounds,&#xD;
the mighty plains, the shaded valleys, the&#xD;
green forests which he has kindly bestowed&#xD;
upon us. White woman, the Indian did not&#xD;
make himself; but one greater than he made&#xD;
him, with all his instincts. Can his nature&#xD;
change ?  Can he be other than he is?  Who&#xD;
faults him will offend the greatand eternal Mas-&#xD;
ter of Life. See me-regard me-study me!&#xD;
I am what I am, not because I had any voice&#xD;
in it, but because a will stronger than mine ex.&#xD;
isting before I had consciousness, willed it so. -&#xD;
My face is red-my -nature is not soft and weak&#xD;
like yours ; it does not love cities and the arts&#xD;
of your people-it has joy in the hunt, and on&#xD;
the war-path. And why?     Because it is so&#xD;
decreed. I am   an* Indian, and I thank the&#xD;
Great Spirit that I am I Thus, you see, the&#xD;
Power that created me reconciles me to be&#xD;
what r am; therefore, He is wise. It is so&#xD;
with you. You will act true to your nature,&#xD;
and I shall to mine.* The manners and customs&#xD;
of nations differ. Our ways seem barbarous to&#xD;
&#xD;
vou, and yours are contemptible to us. Pale&#xD;
girl, the corn-spirit is thirsty, we will give him&#xD;
drink."&#xD;
"Last night, the Great Spirit sent rain," said&#xD;
Mignon.&#xD;
- He drinks not water," said the prophet.&#xD;
" Oh, it is vain to struggle against fate !' ex-&#xD;
claimed Mignon&#xD;
" Vain indeed !" added the Indian, in a deep,&#xD;
sepulchral voice.  "Could those towering&#xD;
mor'ntains have resisted the will that placed&#xD;
them there for a barrier between us and the&#xD;
sea? Could the snow have helped falling upon&#xD;
their summits ? Could you have struggled&#xD;
against his hand when he took up the dust to&#xD;
form  you?  Know, 0    fair daughter of a&#xD;
hated race, that all things are ordered, and not&#xD;
anything can change. , It being destined that&#xD;
you shall die, how can mortal power make you&#xD;
live ? Cease to struggle, and meet calmly a&#xD;
fate that you cannot resist ; this is the lesson&#xD;
taught by everything in Nature. Because you&#xD;
are a woman, and your flesh is tender and&#xD;
shrinks from pain, the Master of Life sends you&#xD;
an easy death."&#xD;
The prophet made a sign to Tallbear, who&#xD;
approached with a small cord, composed of the&#xD;
inner bark of a tree.&#xD;
For an instant, Mignon experienced a fearful&#xD;
shrinking, and a sickening agony of spirit ; but&#xD;
conquering measurably her weakness, she&#xD;
looked at the chief, and demanded, in a voice&#xD;
quite free fromnagitation:._&#xD;
"What is the manner of my death ?"&#xD;
" It is quick-and easy; an arrow will pierce&#xD;
your bosom, and you will be in the spirit-land&#xD;
of your fathers before one of yonder clouds&#xD;
can pass over the sun's face," he replied.&#xD;
" It is well-I am ready ; but do not muti-&#xD;
late my person. Bury -my body on one of&#xD;
yonder high cliffs, where the same sun that&#xD;
shines upon the wigwam of my father may&#xD;
shine on my ashes !" said Mignon, submissive-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
Tallbear came near to bind her hands.&#xD;
" Take away the cord ; since there is to be&#xD;
no torture, no protracted agoriy, to bind me&#xD;
were useless. Tell me where to stand,- and I&#xD;
will present my breast to your  arksman."&#xD;
"Pale girl, you have courage,'said Tallbear,&#xD;
in a low tone. "I would save you if I could,&#xD;
for your voice has a wondrous melody in it,&#xD;
and your beauty is -like that of the spirit-&#xD;
maidens in the far lard of souls. Maiden, the&#xD;
arrow that enters your bosom will give pain to&#xD;
the heart of Tallbear. But the Great Spirit is&#xD;
wise. It is better that you should be taken&#xD;
from my eight."&#xD;
Then, in a louder voice :&#xD;
"Daughter of the Longlnives, we will not&#xD;
send you unprovided to the land of Shadows,&#xD;
your horses shall go with, and your beautiful&#xD;
lodge, that you may have a horse to'ride, and&#xD;
a lodge to dwell in."&#xD;
&#xD;
58&#xD;
&#xD;
Tallbear waved his hand, and the circling&#xD;
horde of warriors, women, and children open-&#xD;
ed before him.&#xD;
"Look !" said he, pointing through the nar-&#xD;
row lane thus made,'" yonder are your horses,&#xD;
and your lodge has been taken down and&#xD;
packed upon them.    When you rach the&#xD;
country (if spirits, you will not have long to&#xD;
wait for your horses ; you will find everything&#xD;
as it was in this world, and the black man&#xD;
with the strong arms will be there to attend&#xD;
you; he is waiting you now; when he sees&#xD;
your large horse, he will hasten to prepare&#xD;
him for your tuse, and,lie will hang your little&#xD;
rifle at the saddle, if' you should want to hunt&#xD;
the deer "&#xD;
Mignon saw the animals at a short distance,&#xD;
prepared as for a journey. The one she usual-&#xD;
ly rode, seeing his mistress, erected his ears&#xD;
and neighed-a proof of affection which called&#xD;
tears to her eyes. With a parting glance at&#xD;
the noble creature that had borne h.,e uncom-&#xD;
plainingly so many miles. she submitted herself&#xD;
to the cottiinands of Tallbear.,.&#xD;
t Place me quickly, and let it be soon over,"&#xD;
she said.&#xD;
The chief led her to the centre of the cir-&#xD;
cle.&#xD;
"This is the spot. Here is a bandage to&#xD;
cover your eyes  Your heart is not big enough&#xD;
to see the how bent and the arrow pointed;&#xD;
you will shrink and run away, or swoon with&#xD;
terror."  , '&#xD;
"I will do neither; since .it is my duty to&#xD;
die, I will die as becomes the daughter of the&#xD;
great pale-face nation."&#xD;
There was a general murmur of approba-&#xD;
tion.  -&#xD;
" It is good," said Tallbear.&#xD;
Then, in a whisper&#xD;
4 Never had the corn-z pirit a more beautiful&#xD;
offering. Your eyes are like those of the deer&#xD;
when the hunter's. knife is at its throat, hang-&#xD;
ing over its small neck. Pale girl; you have&#xD;
power over Tallbear !"&#xD;
The Indian gazed a moment at Mignon with&#xD;
a softened expression-his strong hand trem-&#xD;
bled while placing her in the attitude deemed&#xD;
fitting-and more than once he hesitated and&#xD;
looked at the horses; some half-formed pur-&#xD;
pose appeared to agitate him.&#xD;
"Mailen, be firm-the way to the land of&#xD;
souls is toward the West, and your swift horses&#xD;
will fly like birds along the path."&#xD;
With a heavy breath, much like a sigh of re-&#xD;
gret, the chief left Mignon, who .stood with&#xD;
her face toward the open space in the circle.&#xD;
The ribbon or scarf of high-colored stuff which&#xD;
covered the upper portion of her person, was&#xD;
suffered to fill a little upon the left side, while&#xD;
over the breast she placed the gift of Raven-&#xD;
claw-a raven wrought in beads.&#xD;
" Let your bowman aim at this ; my heart&#xD;
is beneath it," she said, with a calmaess that&#xD;
&#xD;
surprised the grim warriors, and raised an-&#xD;
other hum of admiration.&#xD;
A sinewy Indian walked through the living&#xD;
avenue, and appeared at the margin of the se-&#xD;
cond circle. He carried' a long-bow in his&#xD;
right hand, which, when held vertically beside&#xD;
him, with one end resting upon the ground,&#xD;
reached higher than his head. IHis quiver&#xD;
slung over his bare and brawny shouilderc on-&#xD;
tained but a single arrow; pointed with lone.&#xD;
He came with a lithe and dignified step. and&#xD;
stopping at the proper spot, stood erect,befjore&#xD;
Mignon a few yards distant. She heard his'&#xD;
coming, and there was a quickened motion of&#xD;
the snowy' globe which was tohe his mark.&#xD;
He glanced inquiringly at Tallbear ; the latter&#xD;
saw him not ; with folded arms, compressed&#xD;
lips, and heaving chest, he was looking at&#xD;
Mignon. The red archerremained motionless;&#xD;
suddenly Tallbear turned toward him ;, his face&#xD;
was flushed, there were beads of perspiration&#xD;
on his forehead ; he made a hasty gesture to&#xD;
the Indian who was waiting his orders ; he&#xD;
took the arrow from the quiver, and fitted it to&#xD;
the string. Mignon stirred not, trembled not,&#xD;
though conscious of the movement.    The&#xD;
archer paused with the shnaft leveled at the fig-&#xD;
ure of the raven upon Mignon s breast ; he&#xD;
waited another signal when he would bend the&#xD;
jtufgh fibres of the sturdy wood, and launch&#xD;
the arrow like lightning at the fairest mark&#xD;
man ever aimed at. Taillbear was in the aet&#xD;
of giving that signal, and the Indian was about&#xD;
to let fly his fatal shaft when a bright object&#xD;
gleamed momentarily in the air, and be fell&#xD;
forward upon his face. Immediately, before a&#xD;
warrior had moved, a grim and terrible figure&#xD;
bounded into the circle ; his skull was bare to&#xD;
the bone, his face black and streaked with&#xD;
blood; a savage fury and determination marked&#xD;
his motions. He caught Mignon in his arms,&#xD;
and with such a look as the lion casts upon&#xD;
those who kill her young, bore her from the&#xD;
ring. No one spoke, not a 'hand grasped a&#xD;
knife, gun, or tomahawk-all. tongues were&#xD;
mute, every warrior paralyzed. Mignon was&#xD;
lifted to the back of her favorite horse ; the&#xD;
reins were given her-she grasped them-she&#xD;
felt herself in rapid flight, and one who seemed&#xD;
to her bewildered fancy like Balaam, was at&#xD;
her side.&#xD;

CHAPTER     XI.&#xD;
NEW ADVENTURES IN THE CANON.&#xD;
Balaarn, it will be remembered, was stunned&#xD;
by a hatchet, hurled effectively at his head by&#xD;
a warrior ; losing his seat, he finally sank ex-&#xD;
hausted beneath repeated wounds. He re-&#xD;
mained insensible a long time. The first pre-&#xD;
monition of returning life was a consciousness&#xD;
of pain. He became sensible, at last, of some&#xD;
kind of an existence, without the ability to&#xD;
connect the past with the present, or to know&#xD;
wltere the thread of outer life had been broken&#xD;
His head glowing with a fiery heat, his eyes&#xD;
drowned in an abyss of darkness, his stiffened&#xD;
tongue, his throat hot a'nd dry, a dull, weary&#xD;
motion of the heart, made him conscious of&#xD;
misery only, without awakening individual&#xD;
identity.&#xD;
But Balsam's vital powers were strong, and&#xD;
able to resist much suffering ; they prevailed,&#xD;
at length, over wounds and bruises, restored&#xD;
sight to his swimming vision, and activity to&#xD;
his brain. He raised his head from the ground ;&#xD;
the red beams of the sun, then at its meridian,&#xD;
glowing into his face, extinguished, for an in-&#xD;
stant, his newly-restored sight.&#xD;
Presently he arose to his feet, he saw one of&#xD;
Mignon's gloves lying.near him, and it quick-&#xD;
ened at once the sluggish current of memory.&#xD;
The thought of Mignon in danger absorbed&#xD;
him wholly, to the utter exclusion of himself,&#xD;
his wounds, and his wretched condition. He&#xD;
quenched his burning. thirst at the nearest&#xD;
stream, and then took the trail of the savages,&#xD;
with the eagerness of a hound that scents' his&#xD;
prey. His iron frame disdained its wounds,&#xD;
and his resolute soul, with the undying faith-&#xD;
fulness of the dog, scorned physical pain and&#xD;
the gnawiags of hunger. Fortunately for him,&#xD;
most of his hurts were not of a very dangerous&#xD;
character, the blow upon his head, with the&#xD;
loss of his scalp, being the most serious ; though&#xD;
his arms and body were much hacked and scar-&#xD;
red by knives and other weapons.&#xD;
Defying all obstacles, Balaam tracked the&#xD;
red robbers who had wrested away his precious&#xD;
charge, determined to save her or share her&#xD;
fate. Iniwhat manner he was to deliver her,&#xD;
he did not know, or even ask himself-so en-&#xD;
tirely were his still disordered faculties occu-&#xD;
pied in the idea of pursuit. He reached the&#xD;
Indian town at the moment when Mignon's&#xD;
fate seemed decided. He was going to throw&#xD;
himself upon the Indian with the bow, and&#xD;
crnsh him with his giantstrength, when a gleam-&#xD;
ing shaft passed him like lightning, and the&#xD;
tawny archer fell, stricken through the brain&#xD;
with a steel-headed arrow. We have related&#xD;
what then occurred. The Indians, after the&#xD;
rescue of Mignon, took up the dead body of&#xD;
the warrior, and retired in silence to their vil-&#xD;
lage. It was to them evident that the Great&#xD;
Spirit was not pleased with' what they had&#xD;
proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Mignon and Balaam had not proceeded far,&#xD;
before they discovered a party of men advanc-&#xD;
ing, that proved to be Captain Brion, Buckeye,&#xD;
and a select number of hardy mountaineers.&#xD;
This sudden meeting, together  with the singu-&#xD;
lAr plight of the black, excited both inquiry&#xD;
and surprise ; and' the latter gave place to&#xD;
gratitude, when the startling experiences of&#xD;
Mignon and the negro had been properly set&#xD;
forth. No one, however, not excepting Ba-&#xD;
laam, was more thankful than the partisan,&#xD;
for the wonderful escape of Mignon. The re-&#xD;
vulsion-of feeling was so great with her, when&#xD;
she fully realized that she was snatched from&#xD;
death, and was safe with friends, that she lost&#xD;
her consciousness. 'Brion being the first to&#xD;
observe that she was fainting,, caught her in&#xD;
his arms, thus timely preventing a fall front&#xD;
her horse. Balaam, too, now that the excite-&#xD;
ment was over, felt the need of attention,- and&#xD;
the poor fellow was immediately attended to-&#xD;
his wounds dressed, his bravery praised, his&#xD;
fidelity lauded. The purifying and cooling&#xD;
effects of water, and the cornfortintr nature of&#xD;
brandy, were speedily tested, in his case, with&#xD;
the most happy effects. Hearty food was not&#xD;
allowed him, but he was permitted to swallow&#xD;
a portion of a biscuit with his argnardeuite,&#xD;
when his vivacity being measurably restored,&#xD;
he was able to utter several pleasantries at the&#xD;
expense of his scalpless cranium. The neces-&#xD;
sary sanatory operations having been attended&#xD;
tr4 the mountaineers resumed their way toward&#xD;
the canon, in which the band -had encamped&#xD;
the previous day. The partisan placed him-&#xD;
self near Mignon, occasionally asking questions&#xD;
concerning her capture, referring to his own&#xD;
anxiety, and detailing the efforts he had made&#xD;
to find her. The account of her rescue was to&#xD;
him intensely interesting. There was some-&#xD;
thing perfectly incomprehensible in that trans-&#xD;
action. The idea of the mysterious Redpath&#xD;
was again evoked ; how could it be otherwise?&#xD;
Had not the evidence of his presence been in-&#xD;
dubitable ? Unquestionably, yes.. There had&#xD;
been a death from an arrow in a manner that&#xD;
he had himself witnessed.,&#xD;
"Mademoiselle Bellmar," he said, "it would&#xD;
appear that'you owe your escape to the inter-&#xD;
position of that ever-present creature, Red-&#xD;
path?"&#xD;
"My mind has been in such a world of ex-&#xD;
citement and confusion since ,my unexpected&#xD;
escape, that I have-not yet reflected calmly ;&#xD;
but that I am indebted to Redpath, seems an&#xD;
inevitable:conclusion--a conviction that forces&#xD;
itselfupon me spontaneously, without the trou-&#xD;
ble of reasoning,'' she replied.&#xD;
. "It would interest me to know what your&#xD;
ideas may be concerning this, singular person'&#xD;
age, who has a marvellous power of ubiquity,&#xD;
certainly," Brion added.&#xD;
Mignon paused to ralfy her thoughts.&#xD;
" Hitherto," she answered, "my conceptions&#xD;

"Will you be good enough, Buckeye, to re-&#xD;

use of?" requested the mountaineer.&#xD;
" Well, cap'n, it would be oncommon like&#xD;
the one I heard you sayin' in your sleep, not&#xD;
long ago."&#xD;
"gYou are talking at random !" protested&#xD;
Brion. palpably disconcerted.&#xD;
" There's two things I never do-I mean talk&#xD;
at random or shoot at random. But as to the&#xD;
prayer, it should commence somewhat in this&#xD;
fashion: '0 Mignon, a rude old sinner entreats&#xD;
you never to leave him, that there may be&#xD;
somethin' lovely and good allers near to apol-&#xD;

"Not so bad," said Brion.&#xD;

that you mean me well,,and intend no disre-&#xD;

if you had been his own child."&#xD;
'There's a heap of malice in ye, cap'n! I&#xD;
ain't old enough to he the girl's father, no&#xD;
ways, and the innooendo isn't altogether friend-&#xD;
ly," repliedathe trapper, gravely.&#xD;
''Oh, I na sure you are not old," added&#xD;
Mignon.&#xD;
"Sartinly not. Here's Flash ; I'll leave it&#xD;
to Flash ; and Flash has known me long 'n any&#xD;

I live long enough."&#xD;
" I have youin much favor, now," replied&#xD;
Miss Bellmnar, playfully.&#xD;
In pleasant conversation the parties beguiled&#xD;
the tedium of thenreturning trail. By the mid.&#xD;
dle of the afternoon, they were within a few&#xD;
miles of the canon.&#xD;
Life seemed more precious to Mignon than&#xD;
at any previous period of her existence. The&#xD;
sun, the skies, the earth,.presented new attrac-&#xD;
tions and beauties hitherto unappreciated. She&#xD;
marveled that she hadever beheld them with&#xD;
feelings of indifference.&#xD;
" Glorious world !" she mentally exclaimed,&#xD;
"I shall not yet leave thee. I shall dwell&#xD;
with and in thee, and experience for many&#xD;
years, perchance, the munificence of provident&#xD;
Nature."&#xD;
Hearing woids of salutation from Buckeye,&#xD;
,he looked up, and perceived that two persons,&#xD;
&#xD;
on horseback,had joined thekparty.&#xD;
14Ah !" said Brion, who kept his place at&#xD;
her side, "here is an addition to our num-&#xD;
bers."&#xD;
er"And you will do well to be on your guard.&#xD;
One of those approaching is the special instru-&#xD;
ment of Mariot-aohalf breed, whose name is&#xD;
Gardette, generally known, I believe, by his&#xD;
Indian name of Beavertaker ; while the other&#xD;
is no less a personage than Captain Callard,&#xD;

non.&#xD;
"I .know them, mademoiselle. That Provi-&#xD;
dence which reaches to the wilderness, and be-&#xD;
yond those mighty mountains even, has made&#xD;
me acquainted with those now advauc. fig," re-&#xD;
turned the mountaineer.&#xD;
"tWhatever may be the nature and design of&#xD;
their visit, I trust you will remember, captain,&#xD;
that I am under your protection," Mignon&#xD;
added,.with considerable agitation of manner.&#xD;
11I certainly will not forget a circumstance&#xD;
affording me so much pleasure."&#xD;
" I need not admonish you to be firm."&#xD;
" In your cause such admonition is unneces-&#xD;
sary. But here they are."&#xD;
"Captain Brion, I believe ?" said Callard,&#xD;
addressing the mountaineer.&#xD;
I am, thuns called," said the latter.&#xD;
I think We 'et rnty years ago," resumed&#xD;
the fo rarr ; ' hut this precarious life of ours&#xD;
chant-es th'e human face, you know ?"&#xD;
'The extremes of.heat aud cold, hunger and&#xD;
thirst. and hardship, all set their mark upon&#xD;
the features," Brion answered.&#xD;
During the time this rejoinder occupied,&#xD;
Callard was looking furtively at Mignon.&#xD;
"But," added Brion, "though exposure and&#xD;
suffering may roughen the features, I trust it&#xD;
will never change the heart of an'honest trap-&#xD;
per."&#xD;
"No, assuredly; at least I hope not, in your&#xD;

tried to make. it my study to act the man of&#xD;
honor. Now, will you be kind enough to in-&#xD;
form me to whatlucky chance I owe the honor&#xD;
of this visit?"&#xD;
Disconcerted by the suddenness of this re-&#xD;
quest, Callard exhibited much embarrassment.&#xD;
"What I have to say, Captain Brion, is, pro-&#xD;
bably, -more proper for your private ear," ho&#xD;
rejoined.&#xD;
" If there is aught in your message to m gke&#xD;

&#xD;
as the Indians fired down from their hiding-&#xD;
places at the trappers below, and the latter re-&#xD;
plied by the sharp crack of their rifles. The&#xD;
mountaineer perceived that the attaclhing par-&#xD;
ty was large, for the sides of the canon were&#xD;
occupied in every accessible place, a blaze&#xD;
leaping from every projecting ledge and rock,&#xD;
from ever ycleft and hole.&#xD;
Entering the canon, Brion made such a dis-&#xD;
position of the trappers as at length repelled,&#xD;
the attack of the assailants, after a most obsti-&#xD;
nate resistance. Having restored comparative&#xD;
quiet. lie set out on his return to the timber,&#xD;
where he had left-Mignon when he went to&#xD;
reconnoitre the camp. He had passed the most-&#xD;
perilous portion of the canon, when an Indian&#xD;
suddenly rose from behind a rock, with uprais-&#xD;
e l tomahawk. With sudden presence of mind&#xD;
Brion parried the descending weapon, and&#xD;
dashed his gun against the Indian's head, and&#xD;
brought him to the ground. He felt for his&#xD;
hatchet, but a feeling of mercy prompted him&#xD;
to hesitate. He gazed in the grim face of the&#xD;
warrior a moment,-and slowly taking his foot&#xD;
from his breast, said gently:&#xD;
"Arise! I could have taken your life, but I&#xD;
will not. Depart in peace 1"&#xD;
The Indian arose, walked a few paces, and&#xD;
turning, said:&#xD;
"Son of the Yan-kee, Blackbird will not for--&#xD;
get this. Then moving silently along the canon&#xD;
he said, "Son of the Yan-kee, adieu."&#xD;
When Brion had nearly reached the timber,-&#xD;
shouts and pistol-shots fell on his ear. Quicken-&#xD;
ing his speed, he soon saw a confused mass of&#xD;
human figures, fighting hand to hand, and Mig-&#xD;
non surrounded by a circle of trappers defend-&#xD;
ing her with desperate courage against formida-&#xD;
ble numbers of Indians. With dauntless daring&#xD;
he made his way among them, and forced the&#xD;
enemy to yield wherever he appeared, and thej&#xD;
finally left the field. The little party mounted&#xD;
and 'galloped towards the canon, which they&#xD;
entered soon after the moon had arisen.  But&#xD;
the Indians gathering in the cliffs above the&#xD;
canon, threatened by their numbers to over-&#xD;
wheln them, Brion sought a place of greater&#xD;
security where he might place Mignon,.while&#xD;
the other trappers were engaged in repelling a&#xD;
new attack, and the partisan found himself&#xD;
alone with her.&#xD;
Being thus thrown together, every moment&#xD;
was freighted with interest.  The partisan&#xD;
cared not to speak much ; he was better con-&#xD;
tent to gaze silently at Mignon, whose features&#xD;
in the soft moonli ghtreflected a spiritual beauty.&#xD;
" Has not the firing ceased ?" she asked.&#xD;
"In the canon, yes," said Brion; " but when&#xD;
the moon is higher, it will be resumed again,&#xD;
unquestionably."&#xD;
"Be patient with me, my friend, but I believe&#xD;
my physical powers are quite exhausted."&#xD;
" Nor is it singular that such should be the&#xD;
ease. You hive passed through extraordinary&#xD;
trials."&#xD;
&#xD;
" I think you will have to assist me from my&#xD;
horse.  It appears to me that I am losing my&#xD;
consciousness."&#xD;
The partisan sprang from his saddle, and tak-&#xD;
ing Mignon in his armus, placed her tenderly&#xD;
upon a grassy knoll.&#xD;
"My mouth is burning with thirst. DoI not&#xD;
hear the runninof a stream ?' she said, lan-&#xD;
guidly. The mountaineer tank .a drinking cup&#xD;
from the leathern wallet or valise at his saddle&#xD;
and hastened to look for the rivulet whose bah.&#xD;
bling was audible. He came back with water,&#xD;
and Mignon drank.&#xD;
"Thanks, thanks! How kind is Nature to&#xD;
supply our wants.  What so grateful as this&#xD;
pure beverage to the parched lips ?" she re-&#xD;
marked, returning the cup.&#xD;
Brion made no answer, but held up his hand&#xD;
warningly. The spot where the parties were&#xD;
resting was a glade near the northern entrance&#xD;
of the canon. On that side next the canon the&#xD;
tress were sparse and of small growth : but&#xD;
the prairie-grass was high, and the shrubbery&#xD;
thick.&#xD;
" Yonder," said Brion, "I see the grass in&#xD;
motion, as if a large body of savages were eieep-&#xD;
ing through it."&#xD;
" Heaven keep us from their fury!1" exclaim-&#xD;
ed Mignon.&#xD;
" So let us, trust!1"&#xD;
The mountaineer looked around, to see if&#xD;
some of his party were not in sight, hut not one&#xD;
of them was to be seen. He watched a moment&#xD;
longer the peculiar motion of the grass that had&#xD;
excited his suspicions.&#xD;
It is true !" he exclaimed. "These red&#xD;
hounds have scented us again ! But," he ad-&#xD;
ded, turning to Mignon, " Miss Bellmar, I-will&#xD;
sell life itself in your defence I"&#xD;
"Generous defender ! I hope your hour is&#xD;
not yet. Cast your eyes about you, and nee if&#xD;
some avenue of escape is not open."&#xD;
" I think we are surrounded; but one con&#xD;
solation remains to me yet."&#xD;
What is it ?" inquired Mignon, faintly.&#xD;
" It is the privilege of dying with you?"&#xD;
" Extends your devotion then so far?"&#xD;
" To die for you is my duty."&#xD;
"No, no ; I will not accept the sacrifice Fly&#xD;
a once; escape while you may, and leave me&#xD;
to y fate !" said Mignon, partially rising, ex&#xD;
citement lending her strength.&#xD;
The partisan smiled, but scorned to reply to&#xD;
such a proposition. His calm face never looked&#xD;
so handsome as then to Mignon.&#xD;
" Ah! it is vain to urge such a consideration&#xD;
upon you ! You are firm-you will not go ; I&#xD;
read in your eyes, on your lips," added'Mig-&#xD;
non, in a subdqed voice.&#xD;
"You are right ; I would not leave you ifa&#xD;
thousand warriors were each thirsting for my&#xD;
blood, and each under a vow to give me a&#xD;
wound."&#xD;
" And why ?"&#xD;

THE BUCKEYE RANGER&#xD;
&#xD;
" Because it is. man's duty to protect wo-&#xD;
man, at all places, under all conditions."&#xD;
"Is there no other reason ?"&#xD;
Brion's hitherto placid face was suddenly agi-&#xD;
tated ; but he struggled manfully to regain his&#xD;
composure.&#xD;
"Do you wish me to be perfectly frank ?"&#xD;
"Does the awful danger that encircles us&#xD;
warrant aught but the most entire candor ?"&#xD;
"Evidently, no; but I will say no more un-&#xD;
til I have made yet another effort to save you."&#xD;
The mountaineer raised Mignon from the&#xD;
ground and placed herin the saddle. Mounting&#xD;
his own horse, and entreating her to bear up&#xD;
yet a little longer, he took her bridle, and mov-&#xD;
ed toward an opening at the western margin of&#xD;
the glade, which seemed to offer the only chance&#xD;
of escape. He and his fair companion had gal-&#xD;
loped but a few rods before he perceived that&#xD;
the open space, led directly to the canon, and&#xD;
the ground was too rough to be traversed by&#xD;
horse.,&#xD;
"We seem to be indeed lost," said Brion.&#xD;
"But let us dismount; I can carry you in my&#xD;
arms."&#xD;
"Do not burden yourself with me, my friend&#xD;
Without me you may-elude the savages."&#xD;
"A burden you will not be. Come, let us&#xD;
hasten along the canon. - Ah, but they are very&#xD;
near ! Do you not hear those yells? It will&#xD;
be a pleasure to defend you, and a pleasure to&#xD;
die with you. Mignon, I love you !"&#xD;
Then death will unite us forever!"&#xD;
"Death to me will be welcome. Mignon, you&#xD;
are dearer to me than life I"&#xD;
"My friend, I am yours in life or death, as&#xD;
God may order. We will not be separated."&#xD;
The partisan took Mignon from her horse,&#xD;
and pressing her to his heart, was bounding&#xD;
away, w ben a dusky figure appeared in his path.&#xD;
Supporting her with his left arm, he grasped&#xD;
a weapon with his right.&#xD;
"Son of the pale-face, forbear!" said a deep,&#xD;
calm voice.&#xD;
*"Resist me, and you die !" cried Brion, whose&#xD;
pistol was aimed at the tall, motionless form.&#xD;
"I seek not your life ; if I did, no earthly&#xD;
power could save you," rejoined the Indian.&#xD;
"Speak not so proudly ; we are but man to&#xD;
man ; and I think at this moment that the ad-&#xD;
vantage is with me."&#xD;
fLook!" added the Indian, waving his hand,&#xD;
and emitting a sibulant sound. Brion cast his&#xD;
&#xD;
eyes around, and saw scores of red faces aris-&#xD;
ing about him as if from the earth.&#xD;
" Lost!" exclaimed t he, partisan ; but Mig&#xD;
non, though conscious, was too much agitated&#xD;
to speak; she had covered her eyes that she&#xD;
might not see the dreaded visages of the sava-&#xD;
ges.&#xD;
" Son of the white man, you need not look&#xD;
for those who left you not long ago ; they are&#xD;
prisoners," said the Indian.&#xD;
- " I ask nothing for myself ; prepare your tor-&#xD;
tures ; but spare the maiden!" exclaimed the&#xD;
mountaineer.&#xD;
" You do well not to ask mercy of Ravenclaw;&#xD;
you shall both share the same fate. The nature&#xD;
of the red man is cruelI" returned Ravenclaw,&#xD;
with lofty irony.&#xD;
Mignon unclosed her eyes, and , fixed them&#xD;
upon Ravenclaw.&#xD;
"Lilyface, you are free," he said, with dig-&#xD;
nity.&#xD;
"And this brave man-is he not free also ?"&#xD;
"He dies !" replied the Indian, coldly. -&#xD;
" So will all men die, brave chief."  While&#xD;
Mignon was speaking, she took the figure of&#xD;
the raven from her bosom, and fastened it to&#xD;
Brion's breast.&#xD;
"That saves but one life," said Ravenclaw.&#xD;
'-Let it be his, then. Son of the Eagle, I am&#xD;
your captive."&#xD;
Ravenclaw remained silent a moment, then&#xD;
turning to the grim circles of braves, said, au.-&#xD;
thoritatively :&#xD;
" Warriors, release your prisoners, and return&#xD;
to your lodges."&#xD;
He did not speak again until every red face,&#xD;
had vanished.&#xD;
" Lilyface,you and your people shah live I&#xD;
have saved them; yet the red man is cruel&#xD;
his nature is stern like flint."  Then to Br o:&#xD;
"Son of the Buffalo, go your way.   he&#xD;

With agesture of indescribable dignity. Ra-&#xD;
venelaw walked rapidly from sight, while Brion&#xD;
and Mignon gazed after him in breathless i-&#xD;
lence, almost in awe.&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
MIGNON AN INTERESTED. PARTY.&#xD;
Pierre Mariot was possessed of dogged per-&#xD;
severance, when in pursuit of a coveted object.&#xD;
Opposition sharpened his eagerness, and diffi-&#xD;
culties quickened iis energies. If iis intent&#xD;
was bad, it mattered not; the same obstinate&#xD;
firmness marked his movements. His unex-&#xD;
pected repulse by Mignon aroused this perverse&#xD;
principle in his nature, acid subsequent events&#xD;
put it into full action. The motives that in&#xD;
duced her flight to Westport, were, to him, at&#xD;
first, profound  mysteries - mysteries, too,&#xD;
which he was feverishly anxious to penetrate.&#xD;
Her escape from his camp, and from that severe&#xD;
espionage which he intended to exercise over&#xD;
her, disappointed, while, at the same time, it&#xD;
provoked him.&#xD;
That Mignon would put herself under Brion's&#xD;
protection, he was quite sure; and immediately&#xD;
upon the discovery of her flight, conferred&#xD;
with Callard in regard to the best means of&#xD;
again obtaining control of her person, while&#xD;
Beavertaker was sent to watch the movements&#xD;
of the rival band, with instructions to report-&#xD;
vhat he saw as often as practical. He returned&#xD;
at noon on the ensuipg day, with the startling&#xD;
intelligence that Mignon had probably been&#xD;
capturedby the Crows, and that Captain Brion&#xD;
had started in purs it with a picked party of&#xD;
trappers  He made the discovery by overhear-&#xD;
ing a few words while concealed in'the bushes&#xD;
.n ar the encampment of the mountaineer, but&#xD;
the particulars were unknown to him. This&#xD;
news perplexed Mariot not a little; but he&#xD;
settled the matter, after some reflection, in this&#xD;
monner: Brion was undeniably both bold and&#xD;
experienced, and worrid rescue Mignon-if res-&#xD;
cue were possible-without his aid or co-oper-&#xD;
ation; hence he need only remain quiet and&#xD;
await the issue. ' Upon this policy he acted.&#xD;
Through the instrumentality of the half-breed,&#xD;
he was informed, on the following day, of the&#xD;
young lady's rescue, and that she was being&#xD;
conducted to tjre canon by the brave partisan.&#xD;
It was then that Callard was sent with the&#xD;
message, which, as we have seen, was treated&#xD;
as it deserved by Mignon and the Captain&#xD;
Beavertaker was then instructed to instigate&#xD;
the lBlackteet warriors (whose minds ie had&#xD;
influenced  by  presents and inflammatory&#xD;
sp;eeches), to attack the trappers encamped in&#xD;
the canon, w hsich Ie did ; while Kincaid, in&#xD;
the- se rnuse of an Indirin, led another party&#xD;
asaiirsi Brion. for the purpose of withdrawing&#xD;
Mr.uon  froi her protection, in accordance&#xD;
wit tire Wishes of his employer, Mariot.&#xD;
&#xD;
The failure of this scheme to obtain the per-&#xD;
son of Mignon, was a vexatious disappoint-&#xD;
ment, but from which he soon recovered to&#xD;
concoct a new one, in which Headley was to&#xD;
bear some part; influenced by bribes and pro-&#xD;
mises.&#xD;
"Remain encamped in this vicinity until I&#xD;
have captured this truant damsel, and I will&#xD;
give you' such an outfit as you need for the&#xD;
long march before you," said Mariot to Head-&#xD;
lay.&#xD;
, The intended plan failed, and Mariot now&#xD;
endeavored to work upon Headley, to league&#xD;
with him in his purpose to secure the person&#xD;
of Mignon. He gradually prepared him by an&#xD;
artful detail of such a story as he pleased, and a&#xD;
prolonged conversation followed, in which Ma-&#xD;
riot developed so much of his plans to his ac-&#xD;
complice as he deemed prudent. These plans&#xD;
we will not now detail, as they will be known&#xD;
by subsequent events. In the meantime, we&#xD;
will return to Mignon.&#xD;
Attended by the partisan and the trappers,&#xD;
who had been taken and released by the Indi.&#xD;
ans, by the orders-of Ravenclaw, she soon had&#xD;
the satisfaction of reaching a place where she&#xD;
could obtain that rest she so much needed.&#xD;
But new and powerful emotions agitated her&#xD;
heart ; she prayed, she wept, and then, over-&#xD;
powered by fatigue, sank to 'sleep to pass&#xD;
through again many of the scenes of the last&#xD;
forty-eight hours. Wien she awoke, she saw&#xD;
the sunbeams creeping in through the aper-&#xD;
tures of the tent, and knew that her slumbers&#xD;
must have been protracted. She felt no dis-&#xD;
position to move, and recalled all that had re-&#xD;
cently transpired, in the proper order of each&#xD;
particular incident. She remembered, too, as&#xD;
a last link in the chain of events, that some-&#xD;
thing unusual had passed between herself and&#xD;
Captain Brion ; the recollection heightened the&#xD;
color of her cheeks, and quickened the pulsa.&#xD;
tions of her heart. She asked if her conduct&#xD;
had been such as became her sex and situation?&#xD;
lf-she had deported herself with dignity, cour-&#xD;
age, and delicacy ? She trusted that she could&#xD;
answer yes with a tolerably clear conscience,&#xD;
but feared that maturer thought might- bring&#xD;
convictions less flattering.&#xD;
r" Come," said Brion, "as you have not&#xD;
breakfasted, you must test the skillfulness of an&#xD;
old French voyageur's cookery-not so varied,&#xD;
percharrce, as the fare to which you have been&#xD;
accustomed, but which I trust you will not find&#xD;
wlrolly unpalatable.&#xD;
Mignon followed the partisan into the open&#xD;

The partisan was already watching the a a, therefore, theloveliness.of Mignon was a reve-&#xD;

downcast look                             far as this attractive divinity was concerned.&#xD;

hunude tones.                             and the sounds were torture to his ears.&#xD;
&#xD;
'THE BUCKEYE lRANGER.&#xD;
&#xD;
The partisan, absorbed in the presence of&#xD;
Mignon, grew daily less observant of Headley,&#xD;
till his movements wereentirely unwatched by&#xD;
him. It was then that the Missourian began&#xD;
to take walks by himself, which daily grew&#xD;
longer and extended farther from the camp. As&#xD;
he returned regularly, and deported himself&#xD;
well, no suspicion was excited, so far as Brion&#xD;
was concerned.&#xD;
One circumstance annoyed the Missourian:&#xD;
he was satisfied that Buckeye had followed him&#xD;
on more than one occasion, which-was a species&#xD;
of espionage threatening to prove fatal to his&#xD;
plans. After many attempts, he succeeded in&#xD;
eluding, he believed, the vigilance of the trap-&#xD;
per. The hour was between sunset and dark.:&#xD;
By a circuitous route he reached the arm of tim-&#xD;
ber, near which the steel arrow had been so&#xD;
singularly projected by an unseen bowman,&#xD;
and into the tree upon which the figure of a&#xD;
man had been carved with the point of a knife.&#xD;
A person advanced from the timber and met&#xD;
him, it was the half-breed. Together they&#xD;
passed into the obscurity of the wood, and con-&#xD;
ferred earnestly for a long time, when Headley&#xD;
hurried back to the canon. At eleven o'clock,&#xD;
when the partisan walked through the encamp.&#xD;
ment, according to his habit, everything was&#xD;
as usual, and he went to sleep with the con-&#xD;
scionsness that all was safe.&#xD;
When he visited Mignon's tent in the morn-&#xD;
ing, she was riot there. While wondering at&#xD;
the circumstance, Buckeye came to inform him&#xD;
that several of the horses had been stolen dur-&#xD;
ing the night, Mignon's among others.&#xD;
"Where is Headley ?" asked Brion.&#xD;
" He's not to be found," said Buckeye. " By&#xD;
the beard of Smith !"&#xD;
Brion lost no time in useless repinings over&#xD;
what had happened. That he was perplexed&#xD;
and anxious, will be believed, and needs no&#xD;
afiirnation. With characteristic promptness&#xD;
lie commenced a search for Mignon.    The&#xD;
ground around the tent was thoroughly ex-&#xD;
amined, but it was not of a nature to leave a&#xD;
trail ; there was a rocky ridge extending a mile&#xD;
or two from the canon, upon which the foot of&#xD;
man or horse could make no impression.&#xD;
Though sharp-sighted and experienced, the&#xD;
partisan was unable to determine the course of&#xD;
the missing maiden.   Under these circum-&#xD;
stances, he mounted his horse to make a more&#xD;
general investigation. Buckeye, like a faith-&#xD;
ful friend, attended the captain, as much inter-&#xD;
ested in the search, apparently, as lie.&#xD;
"I always mistrusted the cretur," quoth the&#xD;
trapper, alluding to.Headley, "and you remem-&#xD;
ber, perhaps, that I advised you to have noth-&#xD;
ing to do with him, notwithstandin' his peni-&#xD;
tenee."  _&#xD;
" Your suspicions were at first shared by&#xD;
me; but his correct deportment afterward re-&#xD;
stored my confidence," returned the moun-&#xD;
taineer.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'm not blamin' ye forh hin' chariMtabb. u:&#xD;
'twere, because charity is viat we all mi,-o,&#xD;
more or less  I ought to recollect tp o  t&#xD;

The partisan's manly face was ufasife  ' a&#xD;
moment, and he answered:&#xD;
"-It is possible that I have been selfish iny&#xD;
happiness; and upon reflection, I am ilind&#xD;
to think it is so."&#xD;
"No apologies, cap'n ; in sich a case it isn't&#xD;

puttiest woman alive, and interestin' to'nmatch.&#xD;
As old as I am-and I'm a little up'ards of forty&#xD;
-I'm almost fool enough to love her myself&#xD;
" What pleasure it gives me to hear y'u&#xD;
speak so kindly of her!" said Brion, warmly.&#xD;
" Who could speak otherwise? There's no-&#xD;
body with a heart that knows her that can say&#xD;
anythin' that isn't to her praise. You'll be ia&#xD;
happy man with her; if not, 'twill be your&#xD;
own fault."&#xD;
" You forget that she may be lost to me f r-&#xD;
ever ?"&#xD;
" That's a supposable case, but I can't make&#xD;
up my mind to it, yet. She'll turn up somte-&#xD;
where, dead or alive, when you ain't expectin'&#xD;
her. I shall travel a great many miles afore I&#xD;
give her up, nor despair in one day or -wo. or&#xD;
in a week or a month. Flash can carry me&#xD;
like a bird, and won't mind a thousand miles&#xD;
of travel sca'eely at all, 'specially when be&#xD;

needs exercise rather, to lubricate his j'itits,&#xD;

"Buckeye!" exclaimed the partisan, "your&#xD;
friendship gives me courage, and iakes rme&#xD;
think better of my fellow-men."&#xD;
" Beard of' Smith ! it's like your charitable&#xD;
natur to say that. But that's not to the p'it,&#xD;
exactly. I wonder where Callard and his baud&#xD;
may be about this time?"&#xD;
"On the march, and far ahead of us, doubt-&#xD;
less. Ah ! if it was not for this unfortunate&#xD;
affair, we might hope to overtake them. Clear&#xD;
ly, they will reach the trapping-grounds first."&#xD;
" It can't be helped ; you've labored under&#xD;
peculiar diflikilties, and tisn't in the power of&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
BRION'S EsCAPE.&#xD;
" is the moon up, cap'n ?" said Buckeye,&#xD;
rubbing his eyes. There not being any re-&#xD;
sponse, he added, presently, "I'spect it's about&#xD;
time to be stirring. "&#xD;
The silence remained unbroken, Buckeye&#xD;
arose and turned to the spot where he supposed&#xD;
Brion to be slumbering.&#xD;
" Beard of the prophet Smith ! He isn t&#xD;
here ! Well, lie can't be fur off, that's sartin.&#xD;
Perhaps he's gone after the horses. No lie&#xD;
hasn't. neither; for there they stand in plain&#xD;
sight."&#xD;
"By the book of Mormon !" exclaimed Buck-&#xD;
eye, suddenly. "Somebody's arter the cap'n's&#xD;
hoss!"&#xD;
his observant eye had detected a man crouch-&#xD;
ed in the grass in the act of cutting the side-&#xD;
line from the trapper's steed.&#xD;
"Look this way !" shouted Buckeye.&#xD;
The thief otbeyed, not certain that the words&#xD;
were addressed to him ; but all doubts were&#xD;
dispelled when lie saw the trapper's long rifie&#xD;
covering his head.&#xD;
"If your life's worth anythin' in partie'lar to&#xD;
ye, get up and come this way, and try to re-&#xD;
nemsber that, if you run, I'll drop you as I&#xD;
would a 'tarnal eatamount!"&#xD;
The detected offender reluctantly advanced,&#xD;
revealing no less a personage than the half-&#xD;
breed.&#xD;
"Oh l it's you, is it ? Well, this is nice kind&#xD;
of business for a cretur with white blood in his&#xD;
veins. I s'pect there's no other branch of in-&#xD;
dustry that you can git into," said Buckeye, as&#xD;
Beavertaker approached.&#xD;
"With the people with whom I live, horse-&#xD;
stealing is not esteemed a crime, but rather a&#xD;
virtue," returned Beavertaker.&#xD;
" Well, jest clap down on your knees and&#xD;
say over a little sunthin', and I'll give ye a bit&#xD;
of a lift toward the half breed kentry. I&#xD;
s'pect you haven't got Ingin blood enough in=&#xD;
ye to care any great about a death-song, and&#xD;
as for your explites, it won't take long to tell&#xD;
'em'."&#xD;
At that instant, something fell softly at Bra-&#xD;
vertaker's feet, who, thereupon, evinced much&#xD;
agitation.&#xD;
+ Beavers and otters ! it's an arrow !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Buckeye.&#xD;
But the half-breed was -too much terrified&#xD;
to speak.&#xD;
"You look 'rmazin' white about the mouth,&#xD;
and I reckon there's a heap of meanin' in this&#xD;
title messenger. Come, half-breed, find your&#xD;
tongue."&#xD;
-Yes, there is indeed meaning in it," an-&#xD;
swered Beavertaker, striving - to master his&#xD;
fears. " It tells me that my life hangs on a&#xD;
thread---it warns me to begone, and appear no&#xD;
more in the country of the Blackfeet, on pain of'&#xD;
death."&#xD;

"'Tis the work of Redpath '" said the trap*&#xD;
per, in a subdued voice. " The unknown ere-&#xD;
tur is near; his noiseless feet are walking'&#xD;
around us ; his eagle eyes are seem' us, and his&#xD;
quiver is full of these polished instruments o'&#xD;
death."&#xD;
" There is too much truth in what you say.&#xD;
I shall tarry no longer amid these hills ; -I must&#xD;
direct my footsteps to some distant spot where&#xD;
the name of Red path is unknown."&#xD;
" If that's the case, then free your conscience&#xD;
at once, and you'll go lighter for havin' cast&#xD;
off a great burden of deviltry," advised Buck-&#xD;
eye.&#xD;
" There is one thing I regret," added the half-&#xD;
breed, with some show of remorse.&#xD;
",That's right; I'm glad to hear ye say so;&#xD;

it can't now make any difference to you, either&#xD;
in regard to your pay or future prospects, in-&#xD;

" At fir-st his object was to destroy the trap-&#xD;

"That I have sound out already," said the&#xD;
trapper."&#xD;
" When Mignon appeared," resumed Bea-&#xD;
vertaker, "and went over to Brion's party, it&#xD;

" T make her Madame Mariot, of course."&#xD;

"She is traveling toward the Plains as fast&#xD;

up and followed this trail, und has been taken&#xD;
by this war party. By Joe Smith's beard ! I&#xD;
must be after him."&#xD;
"Madman, stop ! you will but go to share&#xD;

"Share his fate ? I'm willin' to-I'm willin'&#xD;

"Follow your destiny, and 1 will mine.&#xD;
Time is passing, and to me it is the same as&#xD;
life. But I turn my hack upon these familiar&#xD;
scenes with sorrow ; I love the prairies and&#xD;
the wide skies over them ; the mountains have&#xD;
become dear to me, and I love to hunt the buf-&#xD;
falo upon the great hunting-grounds of the red&#xD;
man. I go, and we shall never meet again.&#xD;
Honest trapper, farewell !" Beavertaker said&#xD;
no more, but turning away, was soon out of&#xD;
sight. '&#xD;
"- The kentry's relieved," said the trapper ;&#xD;
"it'll breathe - easier, feel better, and stan'&#xD;
longer, I dare say. It can't be said that Red.&#xD;
path hasn't done some good, pervidin' he's had&#xD;
a hand in the matter ; for one, I'm obleged to&#xD;
him, be he man or demon. But I mustn't for-&#xD;
git for an instant that the cap'n's in danger.&#xD;
i'll hop on to Flash, and it shall go hard with&#xD;
me if I don't find him. Flash can scent an&#xD;
Ingin as far as a dog can his master."&#xD;
Buckeye hastily saddled his horse, and leav-&#xD;
ing Brion's animal to shift for himself, was&#xD;
soon in motion.   With his nose near the&#xD;
ground, Flash followed the trail of the moun-&#xD;
taineer.&#xD;
W hen Flash had gone on in this manner for&#xD;
a half or three quarters of an hour, he stopped,&#xD;
snuffed the air, and shook his head.&#xD;
1 IIe smells the creturs !" said Buckeye ;&#xD;
"they're near-I never knew him to fail."&#xD;
He dismounted, and stood a moment beside his&#xD;
horse.&#xD;
" Flashi," said lie, gently, stroking the crea-&#xD;
ture's neck with his hand, " we've been friends&#xD;
a great while, and it wouldn't be like ye to de-&#xD;
set me now. Stay here. and be as still as&#xD;
death, If I don't see ye again, but go under,&#xD;
the same as a good many better men have,&#xD;
cont never let an Ingin riptile swing his ltg&#xD;
across tour back."&#xD;
Sto'ptig until his figure presented but half&#xD;
its usual attitude, the trapper glided onward&#xD;
anid soon reached the dell, where active pre-&#xD;
parations were being made for the death of the&#xD;
prisoner.&#xD;
The savages had already fixed twelve green&#xD;
stakes in the ground. and were gathering heaps&#xD;
of fagots. To Bu-keye, this was a mournful&#xD;
spectacle ; lie gazd from his place of conceal-&#xD;
ment with mingled feelings of horror and in-&#xD;
dignation. He felt himself in a dreadful di.&#xD;
lemrma; he could witness the agonies of his&#xD;
friend with but little chance of aiding him, or&#xD;
he could fly for assistance back to the canon,&#xD;
with the terrible fear following him at every&#xD;
step that he might be too late to save his life.&#xD;
Thus lie remained. Knowing that it would be&#xD;
rash to undertake anything in favor of Brion&#xD;
against such iiurribers, he concluded to go for&#xD;
assistance, hoping, by dint of hard riding, to.&#xD;
&#xD;
.YE RANGER.                            73&#xD;
return in season to save the captain's life.&#xD;
Creeping back, he. mounted Flash, and rode&#xD;
away as fast as his fleet limbs could carry him.&#xD;
Meantime, the partisan was lying upon the&#xD;
ground in the most painful position. He saw&#xD;
the green stakes driven, the fagots brought,&#xD;
dry pine splinters prepared, and various oth--r&#xD;
arrangements calculated to shake the sternest&#xD;
resolution. He had abandoned himself to his&#xD;
fate with a kind of despairing apathy, when a&#xD;
sudden recollection, like a gleam of light,&#xD;
flashed through his mind.&#xD;
"Prairiewolf," said he,."is it not the will of&#xD;
the Great Spirit that I should die now ?"&#xD;
" White men talk often of the Great Spirit,"&#xD;
replied the chief, ironically. "Why do you&#xD;
think he has not called you, and that you shall&#xD;
live longer upon the earth?"&#xD;
" Unbutton my hunting-frock, and you will&#xD;
find that beneath it which will answer your&#xD;
question."&#xD;
Rending over Brion, he tore open his frock,&#xD;
and there was revealed to his wondering sight&#xD;
the figure of a raven wrought in beads.&#xD;
Prairiewolf stood silent and  confounded ;&#xD;
rage and disappointment were pictured upon&#xD;
his visage.&#xD;
" Accursed Fox!'' he exclaimed. "Some of&#xD;
your cunning yet remains. This is indeed a&#xD;
mighty medicine. I will show it to my war-&#xD;
riors, and hear what they say."&#xD;
Prairiewolf took the talisman, and, going&#xD;
away a little distance, called his braves around&#xD;
him, when considerable talking followed in low&#xD;
tones. Presently the chief returned, and giv-&#xD;
ing the mountaineer the memento that seemed&#xD;
to possess such power, said :&#xD;
"You were right, pale-face ; your time has&#xD;
not come; you may yet live many moons to)&#xD;
trap, the otter and the beaver. See ! 1 cut&#xD;
your bands-; rise up; you are free!"&#xD;
The mountaineer sprang lightly to his feet.&#xD;
and the fear of a painful death rolled hack from&#xD;
his soul. He stretched out his aris-he shook&#xD;
himself like an impatient steed-a sense of&#xD;
freedom made him happy.&#xD;
"'Tis the providence of God !" lie exclaimed.&#xD;
"Yes," said Prairiewolf, "it is a great thing&#xD;
that has happened. There is your way-go ;&#xD;
at, remember that you shall yet feel the claws&#xD;
0. Prairiewolf!"&#xD;
"To thank you for my life, would be giving&#xD;
u too much credit for humanity ; I shall&#xD;
therefore reserve my gratitude for one more&#xD;
powerful than thou. Adieu,. unfriendly red&#xD;
knan !"&#xD;
A brave advanced and handed Brion his rifle ;&#xD;
throwing the weapon upon his shoulder, he&#xD;
walked from the camp of his enemies with a&#xD;
firm and dignified step.&#xD;
Brion took the way he had come, and as he&#xD;
increased the distance between himself and the&#xD;
savages, quickened his pace.&#xD;
" Wabuma !" said a voices near the mon-&#xD;

the chaparral adverted to in another place.&#xD;
The partisan cocked his rifle, and looked for the&#xD;
speaker, who immediately emerged, from the&#xD;
miezqit at his left.&#xD;
" What is your purpose ?" questioned Brion,&#xD;
presenting his rifle.&#xD;
" To pay a debt I owe you !"&#xD;
"1 know von not," added the captain.&#xD;
"Yan-kee, I am Blackbird, son of the Ra-&#xD;
ven," rejoined the Indian.&#xD;
The partisan eased the hammer of his rifle-&#xD;
lock softly back upon the u broken cap, and&#xD;
dropped the breach of the weapon to the&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
"Ah i! I remember."&#xD;
"'Wabu ma, attend thou! When yonder war-&#xD;
party set out I was not ready, for I had certain&#xD;
rites to perform necessary to insure success ; I&#xD;
overtook them  this morning, after you had&#xD;
given Prairiewolf the great medicine."&#xD;
"Go on," said Brion.&#xD;
"Prairie wolf cut your bonds, and said :&#xD;
' Arie -; you are at liberty': arise and depart.' "&#xD;
"Yes," added Brion, wondering at what&#xD;
Blackbird was coming to.&#xD;
" But," resumed the Indian, "lie spoke de-&#xD;
ceitfully, and there was wickedness in his&#xD;
heart. Yau-kee, he has planned your death&#xD;
When you pass yonder spring, two braves will&#xD;
spring upon you and dispatch you with their&#xD;
tomahawks. Prairiewolf has sent them there&#xD;
for that purpose; they pre crouching in the&#xD;
grass, waiting the sound of your coming."&#xD;
" Blackbird, behold how the Great Spirit&#xD;
rewards mime for a merciful act!"&#xD;
" Wa-wa ! the Master of Life is just; he&#xD;
never forgets, and his red children are like&#xD;
h11m1"&#xD;
" Do you not fear the consequence of be-&#xD;
traying this secret ?" Brion asked.&#xD;
" l would have warned you of this if the&#xD;
twelve fires that were to be lighted for you were&#xD;
to be emy only reward for the deed. 1 will re-&#xD;
pey the debt I owe you. though they thrust&#xD;
tmy flesh full of blazing splinters, and burn out&#xD;
my tongue."&#xD;
"My brother," said Brion, with increased&#xD;
earnestness, "I regret that my people do not&#xD;
better understand your race. I would to God&#xD;
that mutual hatred might no longer exist ;&#xD;
that jealousy and bloodshed might cease for-&#xD;
ever '&#xD;
" Yan-kee, I have given life for life; go your&#xD;
way, and remember that Blackbird did not&#xD;
pro"ve ungrateful."&#xD;
'T eaIndian vanished like a spirit-so quick-&#xD;

ca:parril-anid the partisan, changing his&#xD;
course, mnale a detour'to the right, thus avoid-&#xD;
mnt~ the ambush of the wily Prairiewolf. He&#xD;
rescued the spot where he had left Buckeye,&#xD;
fnmis horse quietly feeding, but, of course,&#xD;
saw nothing of toe trapper or Flash.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was now daylight. Thinking it probable&#xD;
that Buckeye was loooking for him, Briou con-&#xD;
cluded to remain in that vicinity for a while,&#xD;
believing that he should be more likely to find&#xD;
him in that way than. by searching for him.&#xD;
He did not, by any means, intend to slumber,&#xD;
but having slept none during the night, Na-&#xD;
ture proved stronger than his resolution, and&#xD;
he fell into an unquiet slumber, in which he&#xD;
dreamed of the Blackfeet and Mignon   IIe&#xD;
was aroused from his somnolency by sounds&#xD;
that would not have been noticed by one who&#xD;
had not passed many years in a country where&#xD;
constant watchfulness was required, but whose&#xD;
proved to be produced by human feet; for the&#xD;
first object that met the mountaineer's gaze&#xD;
was a nan who was looking wistfully at his&#xD;
horse.&#xD;
"Stranger," said Brion, " what brings you&#xD;
here ?"&#xD;
The individual, who obviously had not seen&#xD;
the partisan, now turned toward him,: with a&#xD;
start indicative of surprise.&#xD;
" Ah," added Brion, immediately, "I think&#xD;
we have met before ?"&#xD;
" Yes, and not much to my advantage," re-&#xD;
plied the man, pointing to a wound upon his&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"You received that little memento of my&#xD;
good-will at the timber near the canon," con-&#xD;
tinued the partisan.    .&#xD;
"I am pretty well aware of it," said Kin-&#xD;
caid.&#xD;
" This meeting, I perceive, is opportune ; I&#xD;
have some questions to propose to you, which&#xD;
I hope you will answer without prevarication.&#xD;
My first question is: Can you inform me where&#xD;
Pierre Mariot is ?"&#xD;
" I shall not answer," said Kincaid.&#xD;
" My next." resumed Brion, " is this : Is Mies&#xD;
Bellmar with him?"&#xD;
" I reply to that as to the other question."&#xD;
"Villain!" exclaimed Brion.&#xD;
" If that suits you, why let it be so," replied&#xD;
the Frenchman, with a sneer.&#xD;
" You were, doubtless, about to appropriate&#xD;
my horse."&#xD;
" I supposed it to be an estray."&#xD;
"No apologies ; horse-stealing, I presume,&#xD;
could easily be reconciled to your conscience ;&#xD;
you are not tender, I think. But as the civil&#xD;
questions'I have asked remain unanswered, I&#xD;
will propose another: Tell me if you have&#xD;
any knowledge of the movements of Head-&#xD;
ley?"&#xD;
"I have."&#xD;
" That is well; where is he ?"&#xD;
"That is something I did not agree to tell&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" A truce to this obstinacy! I am inteusely&#xD;
interested in Miss Bellmar, and the movements&#xD;
of Headlet and Mariot'; tell me where to find&#xD;
them, and~I will make it worth your trouble."&#xD;

"6Y'u spoke of buying my knowledge ; what&#xD;
will you give?'&#xD;
What do 3 on demand ?"&#xD;
There is your horse ; it is a fine one ; I&#xD;
will accept him as a gift, and in return for&#xD;
your kindness, tell you all I know of Made-&#xD;
*nloiselle Behmar and Mariot," said Kincaid,&#xD;
with a cool effrontery provoking to Brion, who&#xD;
was loth to part with an animal he valued&#xD;
highly.&#xD;
""It is a hard bargain you are driving with&#xD;
me, but I will compromise -matters by giving&#xD;
you the price of the animal in money, or such&#xD;
goods as I have at the encampment," he an-&#xD;
a wered. ..-&#xD;
"No, that will not do; I'1 have the horse,&#xD;
or.it's no trade, and not a word passes my lips;&#xD;

'*You are indeed a pitiful knave, and it&#xD;
taxes my patience sorely to keep from laying&#xD;
violent.hands upon you; nevertheless, if these&#xD;
are your easiest terms, I accept."&#xD;
"Saddle him and bring him here, and place&#xD;
the bridle rein in my hand, that I may be sure&#xD;
there is no trickery about it."         '&#xD;
With a sigh of regret, and something like re-&#xD;
morse,' the partisan complied with this request.&#xD;
Kineaid took the bridle and threw it over 'the&#xD;
animal's neck. The horse, resenting this fa-&#xD;
miliarity from a stranger, or frightened at the&#xD;
suddenness of the act, reared and backed, Kin-&#xD;
caid retiring with him until be- was several&#xD;
yards from the mountaineer, then springing&#xD;
with agility to the saddle, gave him the rein,&#xD;
and struck his rnks with his heels. In a se-&#xD;
cond, he was galloping away.,&#xD;
BM-ion drew up his rifle with the intention of&#xD;
wounding the rascal, but it missed fire. Kin-&#xD;
caid had taken off the cap while he was sad-.&#xD;
dling the horse.&#xD;
'Put on a cap I" shouted the Frenehman,&#xD;
looking back over his shoulder:&#xD;
At that instant, the partisan saw a gleam of&#xD;
ligtt passing through the air; Kincaid cried&#xD;
out like one in mortal pain, and' fell headlong&#xD;
from the horse.&#xD;
Brion hastened to him; he found him upon&#xD;
she ground in the agonies of death.. A steel.!&#xD;
headed arrow had passed through his lungs, and&#xD;
the glittering point was visible near the spinal&#xD;
columns beneath the shoulder.&#xD;
He fixed his glassy eyes upon the moun-&#xD;
taineer.&#xD;
"It is ended !" said he, in a husky voice.&#xD;
"'m dying. My fears were prophetic-Red-&#xD;

tie a heavy stone to my holy, and sink it in the&#xD;

risk! twelve tires-three dafs--roastin'-pine&#xD;
splinters, and so on."&#xD;
"For which he will accept a father's grati-&#xD;
tude. Lead me to her at once."&#xD;
SI'm not much in the habit of advisin' peo-&#xD;
ple older nor myself, but if I might be allowed&#xD;
to speak in a case like this, I should say.keep&#xD;
down your nat'ral feelin's till we find her.&#xD;
When she's once diskivered, you can be led to&#xD;
her, I reckon ; but till then, I' don't think it&#xD;
can be done.  The truth is, that oncommon&#xD;
woman slipped away from us when we wasn't&#xD;
expecting ' it; if it hadn't been for that sareum-&#xD;
stance, you wouldn't have seen us here, for&#xD;
we're arter her."&#xD;
Mr. Bellmar's countenance indicated the&#xD;
depths of his disappointment, while Brion pro-&#xD;
ceeded to explain the matter as well as he&#xD;
could; in addition to which, he made a general&#xD;
statement of lI that had happened to Mignon,&#xD;
as far as he .new.&#xD;
"1 trust," said Monsier Bellmar, after a&#xD;
pause, " that my daughter's deportment has&#xD;
been at all times such as becomes --~, of her&#xD;
years and sex ?"&#xD;
"Guns and gunpowder! if she'd been Queen&#xD;
of England, she couldn't conducted herself no&#xD;
better! I say it without meanin' no hurt to&#xD;
anybody of her kind ; but I've never seen her&#xD;
equal, on the prairies or off, in towns or cities,&#xD;
and I'm forty and up'ards."&#xD;
Buckeye spoke with particular enthusiasm,&#xD;
rounding the final period with a vigorous cut&#xD;
of his right band through the air.&#xD;
Bellmar looked gratefully at the trapper,pf&#xD;
whose sincerity he had not a doubt, his earnest-&#xD;
ness fully attesting to his honesty.&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
CONCLUSION.&#xD;
Leaving these parties, we return once more&#xD;
to Mignon. She had retired as usual, but 'a&#xD;
little after midnight was awakened by a sense&#xD;
of suffcation, and discovered that a hiandher-&#xD;
chief was tied tightly across her month, and&#xD;
her hanils firmly held by a man, who instantly&#xD;
ra-ihecr in his arms, and bore her swiftly from&#xD;

t&#xD;
&#xD;
Mignon being free from the restraint of the&#xD;
handkerchief, was of course at liberty to ex-&#xD;
press her indignation at such an outrage; a&#xD;
privilege of which she did n'ot hesitate to avail&#xD;
herself.&#xD;
" Mademoiselle Bellmar, I am acting under&#xD;
the influence of a passion that masters me. Do&#xD;
not hold me responsible for my deeds ; indeed,&#xD;
you have driven me mad !" said he.&#xD;
" You screen yourself under a miserable sub-&#xD;
terfuge ! You cannot disguise from me the faet&#xD;
that you are acting under the instructions of&#xD;
Pierre Mariot," Mignon replied.&#xD;
"t In adoring you, I moat certainly do not act&#xD;
under his orders," returned the Missourian.&#xD;
" Tell inc your purpose?" said Mignon.&#xD;
" My hope is that at soie future time you&#xD;
will come to regard me in a manner far mole&#xD;
kindly," responded Headley, with an air of hu-&#xD;
mility.&#xD;
" If you would have such hope realized,&#xD;
conduct me whence you have taken me," sh&#xD;
replied.&#xD;
" That I cannot consent to do ; though if you&#xD;
will, I will save you from  annoyance from&#xD;
Marion "&#xD;
" That you may annoy me yourself! Yes,1I&#xD;
see ; but the change will not be welcomed by&#xD;
me. I demand my liberty ; and you cannot, if&#xD;
a man of honor, refuse my wish.  When wo-&#xD;
man sues, man should not be inflexible."&#xD;
"I could witness your death with more calm-&#xD;
ness than your return to Captain Bion, Misti\&#xD;
Behlmar !" he exclaimed, with emphasis.&#xD;
" Then entreaties are vain; and it only re-&#xD;
mains for me to submit to my fate, begging,,&#xD;
however, to be treated with the deference due&#xD;
to any sex and honor," said Mignon, despair-&#xD;
inglv.&#xD;
" You can do no more and no better, made.&#xD;
moiselle. If you prefer, you may ride your own&#xD;
nurse, you perceive lie is here ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I prefer to ride Brave, suffer me to do&#xD;
so." It was some alleviation of her distress to&#xD;
fid herself upon her favorite steed again ; and&#xD;
she indulged also a secret hope that shne might&#xD;
escape by reason of his speed, by taking advan-&#xD;
tage of some moment when Headley was less&#xD;
watchful. She observed that blankets had been&#xD;
cut in pieces and tied upon the horses' feet to&#xD;
reader the trail indistinct; also that the hard-&#xD;
est ground was chosen to favor the same intent.&#xD;
The party crossed the Nebraska before sunrise,&#xD;
upon a raft that had been constructed for that&#xD;
purpose; which was destroyed when tiey&#xD;
n ached the shore. Mignon's patience and firmi-&#xD;
iiess was then put to a sever e t, for Mariot&#xD;
jo neh them, accompanied by Kincaid, but the&#xD;
hitter imn iediately left with Beavertaker, and&#xD;
did not return.&#xD;

73              THE BUCKEYE RANGER.&#xD;
&#xD;
They now traveled very fast, Pierre being&#xD;
care-ii to keep at some distance from the young&#xD;
.aty, wishing to escape her keen questioning,&#xD;
and deserved rebuke. Mignon quickened the&#xD;
pace of Brave and rode to his side. She de-&#xD;
sured to be informed by what authority he as-&#xD;
toied the control of her person, and where he&#xD;
intended to conduct her. Mariot replied to the&#xD;
eiffct that she must content herself not to know&#xD;
at present, but that all, eventually, would re-&#xD;
sult to her advantage.&#xD;
This was unsatisfactory; Miss Bellmar urged&#xD;
her just interrogatories with becoming spirit.&#xD;
The Frenchman finally grew angry, and re-&#xD;
proached her for rejecting him at Westport,&#xD;
accusing her also of unmaidenly conduct in&#xD;
placing herself under the protection of Captain&#xD;
Brion, a rough and rude trapper, not fit for the&#xD;
companionship of one gently reared, and pos-&#xD;
sessed of lady-like and refined instincts.&#xD;
"Evil-minded, invidious man I" exclaimed&#xD;
Mignon', vexed and wounded by his base inti-&#xD;
maions. "My aversion for your character mo-&#xD;
umaeutarily increases. Think not to shake my&#xD;
constancy of purpose, or conquer my contempt&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
Headley, who was riding in the rear, hear-&#xD;
ing the altercation, rode up, and reproved&#xD;
Mariot for his bad temper, though in language&#xD;
not offensive. Pierre choked down his resent-&#xD;
ment, and no more conversation of that nature&#xD;
ensued.&#xD;
As many of Headley's men as Mariot was&#xD;
able to mount, had been sent forward the day&#xD;
previous; these they overtook before night ;&#xD;
they were to' wait for the remainder at a cer-&#xD;
tain place known to Beavertaker and Kincaid,&#xD;
who were to meet them upon the stolen horses,&#xD;
and conduct them there by another route.&#xD;
Mignon complained of fatigue, and requested&#xD;
Headley to encamp for the night-an artifice&#xD;
which she hoped would prove advantageous&#xD;
to Brion, who, she doubted not, would be able&#xD;
to findthe trail, notwithstanding all the pre-&#xD;
cautions taken. Mariot objected to this pro-&#xD;
jsal, wishing to hurry on as fast as possible,&#xD;
till morning. A difference of opinion there.&#xD;
upon arose, which was decided by vote among&#xD;
the men, and against the judgment of Mariot.&#xD;
This c-circumstance engendered ill-feeling be.&#xD;
tween the leaders, which, enhanced by mutual&#xD;
}ealousy, showed itself often the following day.'&#xD;
Ml!g non foresaw a quarrel, which, possibly,&#xD;
might produce some change in her favor, yet&#xD;
inwardly fearing the crisis that seemed ap-&#xD;
proaelbing. The same scene in regard to&#xD;
caipitig was enacted at the close of the second&#xD;
d y., with the same results. Mignon slept, and&#xD;
was hopeful-more hopeful than at any time&#xD;
since her abduction.&#xD;
The morning sun arose with peerless bright-&#xD;
ness. Nature was glorious in her beauty. The&#xD;
wide-spreading prairies exhaled life and fra-&#xD;
grance. The little camp was astir. Mignon&#xD;
&#xD;
stood near Brave, with her eyes turned wist,&#xD;
fully toward the Wind River Mountains, from&#xD;
which she was daily receding. Could she for.&#xD;
get the scenes thpt ha.i transpired at the feet&#xD;
of those mighty ranges? Never= They had&#xD;
impressed their thrilling events upon her soul,&#xD;
to remain there as long as life and memory&#xD;
lasted.&#xD;
Mariot approached. Mignon remarked that&#xD;
his face wore a gloomy expression. Headley&#xD;
followed him; both stopped a few paces from&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"I hope," she said, addressing Mariot, "that&#xD;
you have come to tell me that you regret what,&#xD;
you have done ?"&#xD;
- "No," he moodily replied ; "I only regret&#xD;
your perverseness."&#xD;
" How will you account for your conduct to&#xD;
my father?" resumed Mignon.&#xD;
"That need not give you uneasiness," re.&#xD;
turned Mariot.&#xD;
"Did the thought ever occur to you, Mon-&#xD;
sieur Mariot, that Red path may be near us ?'&#xD;
inquired Mignon, after a pause.&#xD;
- Diable I" exclaimed Mariot, with a slight&#xD;
shudder. " I wish you would never speak&#xD;
that-name in my hearing."&#xD;
" Is the dread of that man, then, so strong&#xD;
upon you ?" she continued.&#xD;
"You have chosen an inauspicious subject,&#xD;
mademoiselle!" impatiently rejoined Mariot.&#xD;
"Possibly so ; but, perhaps, you believe in&#xD;
omens, premonitions, and such things ?" re-&#xD;
sumed Miss l3ellmar, perceiving the theme&#xD;
annoyed him.&#xD;
"It matters not ; it can make no great dif-&#xD;
ference in our present relations. That I feel&#xD;
dark within, and an unwonted gloom weighs&#xD;
heavily upon me, I confess. I will acknow-&#xD;
ledge even more than this--there is a vague,&#xD;
yet terrible fear of death upon me !"&#xD;
Mariot stood with his face to Mignon, his&#xD;
arms folded on his breast., His eyes were&#xD;
turned to her, while he spoke, with an expres-&#xD;
sion that seemed to ask sympathy. At this,&#xD;
moment, his lips ceased moving, he groaned,&#xD;
and fell at Mignon's feet, who, thinking he had&#xD;
fainted, looked at him with contempt; but&#xD;
that feeling changed to absolute awe when she-&#xD;
discovered the shaft of an arrow, the point of&#xD;
which was lodged in his brain.  While she&#xD;
gazed at this spectacle, so unexpected and so&#xD;
fearful, a man rushed from a growth of pinon&#xD;
just behind her, and, embracing her, exclaimed:&#xD;
"My daughter! my'daughter!"&#xD;
" My dear father!" cried Mignon, recovering&#xD;
somewhat from her bewilderment, and return-&#xD;
ing his caresses.          . :t&#xD;
" Beavers and otters I"&#xD;
Mignon raised her eyes, and saw rion and&#xD;
Buckeye approaching, and hel out both&#xD;
hands to them.&#xD;
