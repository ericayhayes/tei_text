TuE Bedott Papers~-now for the first time collected,&#xD;
were first widely introduced to public notice through the&#xD;
columns of' "Neal's Saturday Gazette."&#xD;
Its editor-Joseph C. Neal, the well known author of the&#xD;
"C1~arcoal Sketches," was struck by the originality and clear-&#xD;
ness of the .flrst of the series, when submitted among the&#xD;
mass of contributions, which crowd a weekly newspaper.&#xD;
It was scarcely in print before the author's name began to&#xD;
be asked by subscribers, ~asuaa readers, and brother editors,&#xD;
some of whom attributed them to Mr. Neal himself~ They&#xD;
could scarcely be made to believe that sketches so full of&#xD;
humor, so remarkable for minute observation of human na-&#xD;
ture, were the work of an unpracticed pen.&#xD;
A correspondence arising in this way between the editor&#xD;
aud his unknown contributor, Mr. Neal learned that "the&#xD;
Widow Bedott," as she was familiarly called, had not even&#xD;
entered the "holy estate," but was still the center of a hap-&#xD;
py home circle, in Whitesbor49, New York. That she had&#xD;
never before written for publication, and was ~ sensitively&#xD;
modest, and-indeed unaware of her reuu~rkable talent as &amp;amp;&#xD;
hui~iorist, that she was quite willing tQ cease then and th.r&#xD;

the history of the Widow's adventures. Mr. Neal's reply&#xD;
to this despondent mood, was perhaps de~isive as regards&#xD;
the continuation of the series, ~and we quote it as preserved&#xD;
among her papers It has the more value as being the&#xD;
unsolicited opinion of a practiced critic who possessed the&#xD;
keenest natural sense of humor.&#xD;
PIIILADELPIIIA, September, 10th, 1846.&#xD;
"My DEAR CORRESPONDENT BEDOTT:&#xD;
"Your last contributions have been received, and are&#xD;
truly welcome. The "Gazette is again deeply your debtor;&#xD;
for your aid has been indeed truly valuable to "Neal."&#xD;
But I regret to find that Duberly Doubtington has cast a&#xD;
"glamour" over you about continuing in the comic vein, just&#xD;
at the moment too, when all the world is full of Bedott.&#xD;
Our readers talk of nothing else, and almost despise "Neal"&#xD;
if the Widow~be not1 there. Au excellent critic in these&#xD;
matters, said to me the other day, that he regarded them as&#xD;
the best Yankee papers yet written, and such is indeed the&#xD;
general sentiment. I know for instance, of a lady who for&#xD;
several days after reading one of them, was continually,&#xD;
and often, 'at moments the most inopportune, bursting&#xD;
forth into fits of violent, laughter, and believe me 'that you,&#xD;
gifted with such powers, 'ought not to speak disparagingly&#xD;
of the gift which thus brings wholesome satire home to&#xD;
every reader. It is a theory of mine that those gifted with&#xD;
truly humorous geniu&amp;amp;., liA~ yourself are 'more us~fid zs moral.&#xD;
ists, phiIo~ophers, and teachers, than whole legions of the&#xD;
gravest preachers. They speak more efectually to the general&#xD;
ear and heart even though they who hear are not aware of&#xD;
the fae4 that they are irn~i~ing wisdom.&#xD;
"To be sure if you have more imperative duties,. I should&#xD;
be the last to wish that you should neglect them~; butif&#xD;
&#xD;
your hesitations arise from other scruples, it appears to me&#xD;
that if you were to weigh them well they may be found&#xD;
mere intangibilities. But of all this you, of course, must&#xD;
be the judge, and any interference on my part would be in-&#xD;
trusive and impertinent.&#xD;
"But I would add that Mr. Godey called on me to inquire&#xD;
as to the authorship &amp;amp;f the "Bedott Papers" wishing evi~&#xD;
gently to obtain you for a correspondent to the "Lady's&#xD;
Book." I declined, giving him the name, etc., until I had&#xD;
consulted you, checking the selfish impulse that would have&#xD;
denied him, that "Neal" might' monopolize a correspond-&#xD;
ent so valued as "Frank." Would you like to hear from&#xD;
him on the subject?&#xD;
"Thii* on it then before yielding up the pen of comedy,&#xD;
but in any event, whether you conclude to be either serious&#xD;
or comic,&#xD;
"Believe me ever yours,&#xD;
"Josi~i'ii C. NEAL."&#xD;
The result of Mr. Godey's negotiations will be found in&#xD;
"Aunt Maguire's Experience"-Aunt Maguire, being cer-&#xD;
tainly worthy of her distinguished relationship.*&#xD;
The New Year found Miriam Berry a bride, and separated&#xD;
from the cherished arid cherishing home circle, with new&#xD;
duties and responsibilities as the 'wife of a clergyman.&#xD;
Yet to quote from a charming inemoAal from the pen of&#xD;
an almost equally gifte~ sister, "Her sketches even under&#xD;
these circumstances, require neither vindication nor apology.&#xD;
They were never condemned by any except those who felt&#xD;
* We may here'add that, as in th&amp;amp; case of Mr. Neal, the friendly interest&#xD;
of the courteous editor of the '~ Lady's Book" de~j~ned from that tizue,&#xD;
rtnd It is with bis wannest approval and predictions of success that the&#xD;
volume conta1ning~'bQth series, is now Is~ued.&#xD;

&#xD;
the sting of her satire pricking against their vices. The&#xD;
good sense of the entire reading public gave them praise,&#xD;
and their popularity was abundantly shown in the eagerness&#xD;
with which the country press copied them from the Phila-&#xD;
delphia papers. her humor was chaste and original, so&#xD;
true to nature that the most ignorant reader could not fail&#xD;
to feel its force, and the most~refined could discover nothing&#xD;
that would shock the keenest sensibility. From the time&#xD;
of Horace to the present, it has al\vays been thought proper,&#xD;
and often profitable, to 'speak the truth laughing.' And&#xD;
the best moralists have acknowledged that laughter, when&#xD;
aimed at folly, was a salutary means of improvement, and&#xD;
a great aid to virtue. Indeed we have the precedent of In-&#xD;
spiration itself, to use the most pointed satire in our at-&#xD;
tempts to promote the Welfare of our fellows. And this&#xD;
was her only aim; for, whether she depicted the verbosity&#xD;
of the self-sufficient preacher, or portrayed the vulgar cc-&#xD;
queteries of the inconsolable widow-.whether s~e held up&#xD;
to view the would-be literary circle, or narrated the gossip&#xD;
of the sewing-society, her only object was&#xD;
To seo4hemsels as others see 'em!&#xD;
Which wad frae manic a blunder free 'em,&#xD;
~&amp;amp;~1 foolish notion."'&#xD;
Such, then, was the origin of the "Bedott Papers," their&#xD;
charaeteristics and their aim. By the early death of their&#xD;
wonderfully gifted author, they have become a literary&#xD;
hrt~ge to her family, and the publication has been decided&#xD;
upoxi by th~, aft.z~ opted solicitatIons from both&#xD;
&#xD;
strangers and friends, who were anxious, to have in &amp;amp; cob&#xD;
elected and accessible form articles they had enjoyed so much&#xD;
as fugitive sketches. For ourselves, we have never' had but&#xD;
one opinion. We remember, as if had been but yesterday,&#xD;
the mirth-moved family circle that listened to the reading&#xD;
of the first of the series with almost convulsive laughter;&#xD;
and from that time until we corrected the proof-sheets of&#xD;
the last, considered th~m among the cleverest, as they cer-&#xD;
tainly were the most popular of any humorous articles by&#xD;
an American author.&#xD;
Though among Mrs. ~ warmest personal friends,&#xD;
we never had the often desired pleasure of meeting her face to&#xD;
face. Yet it is through a correspondence bequeathed to us,&#xD;
as the successOr to Mr. Neal's editorial engagements, and&#xD;
some of his most genial friendships, that the sister before&#xD;
alluded to, gathered much of the material for a sketch of her&#xD;
life and character.&#xD;
Never was there a more remarkable contrast presented,&#xD;
and we quote her own words, for the causes operating 'to&#xD;
produce it.&#xD;
"Your last kind letter was vJy gratifying. The acquisi-&#xD;
tion of a new friend is a source of great pleasure to me; for&#xD;
I assure you that it has never been my lot to have many&#xD;
friends. And I will tell you what I believe to be the secret&#xD;
of it: I received at my birth, the undesirable gift of a re..&#xD;
niarkably strong sense of the ridiculous. I can scarcely&#xD;
remember the time when th~ neighbors were not afraid that&#xD;

INTRODUCTORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
I would 'make fun of them.' For indulging in this proven&#xD;
sity, I was scolded at home, and wept over and prayed wfth,&#xD;
by certain well-n~ieaning old maids in the neighborhood; but&#xD;
all to no purpose. The only reward of their labors was&#xD;
frequently their likenesses drawn in charcoal and pinned to&#xD;
the corners of their shawls, with, perhaps, a descriptive&#xD;
verse below. Of course I had not many friends, even&#xD;
among my ow playmates. And yet, at the bottom of all&#xD;
this deviltry, there was a warm, affectionate heart-if any&#xD;
were really kind to me, how I loved them!&#xD;
"I think new, that I was not properly trained, My&#xD;
errors should have been checked in a different way from&#xD;
that which was adopted. I ought to have received more&#xD;
tender treatment. I became a lonely child, almost without&#xD;
companionship; wandering alone, for hours, in the woods&#xD;
and fields, creating for myself an ideal world, and in that&#xD;
ideal world I lived for many years. At times I was melan-&#xD;
choly almost to despair. My reserve and sadness were&#xD;
called haughtiness and pride. When the best 'part of my&#xD;
life, or rather what should have been the best part of it,&#xD;
was gone, I met my husband. He was the first who pene&#xD;
treated the icy vail about me, sympathized with me, and&#xD;
turned my feet into~ a better path than they had trodden&#xD;
before."&#xD;
A modest, li~ou~ble-hearted Christian woman. "at the bot&#xD;
tom of all this," as she says, she remained until her pen&#xD;
was laid aside for the last time, and she passed to a home&#xD;
where all doubt and misunderstanding are denied an en-&#xD;
trance.&#xD;
&#xD;

"how she looked, spoke and moved," those who read&#xD;
these sketches will doubtless ask, as did we, at an early&#xD;
period of the correspondence. It was met by her 'with a&#xD;
playful rhymed response, of which we can recall but a frag-&#xD;
ment, declaring~ she had&#xD;
I' Hands and feet&#xD;
Of respectable size,&#xD;
Afud-colored hair,&#xD;
And dubious eyes."&#xD;
To the last, she evaded any thing lil~e the self-portraiture s~&#xD;
common among a certain class of female writers, who are as&#xD;
willing to give their faces as their sketches to the public~.&#xD;
Since this would still seem to be the feeling of those most&#xD;
easily interested, we pass to the peculiar artistic cleverness&#xD;
of the original illustrations, which usually accompanied her&#xD;
"Table Talks." They were done as rapidly as her pencil&#xD;
could move, a few strokes "telling the whole story." 'Of&#xD;
the rise and progress of this. remarkable talent, we have&#xD;
~some characteristic anecdotes in Miss Berry's sketch of her&#xD;
sister's childhood.&#xD;
"Her school education was more varied 1~han beneficial.&#xD;
fler first teacher was a sour-faced woman, who knocked the&#xD;
alphabet with her thimble into the heads of a little group of&#xD;
unruly children, at so much 'a quartet' with small love,&#xD;
and no just appreciation of the dawning minds under her&#xD;
care. It was the unwise and cruel practice, then more gen-&#xD;
erally than at present, though still not quite exploded, of&#xD;

"But there was one good custom, then, which, where our&#xD;
limited observation extends, seems to be quite unthought of,&#xD;
if not despised, in the present girls' schools-that of teach-&#xD;
ing the pupils to sew. The object now appears to be to in&#xD;
struct them most in what they shall least need to know&#xD;
afterward. Well, little Miriam was 'told by her teacher to&#xD;
bring some kind of work to busy herself with in school;&#xD;
so, being furnished with a long narrow strip of old, muslin,&#xD;
she went. prepared to take her first lesson in the art of&#xD;
scollopingg." How steadily the small hands stitched away,&#xD;
till the child was summoned by her serious-faced teacher to&#xD;
the table, to have her work inspected. What was Miss&#xD;
-'s amazement on discovering that 'Miriam had adhered&#xD;
but a very little way to her pattern, when, leaving it entire.&#xD;
ly, she had worked a long row of keack on the muslin, after&#xD;
a stitch of her own choosing.&#xD;
"'What a pity,' said tPe careful woman who spoke with&#xD;
a strong nasal accent, 'to waste all that 'ere nice muslin!&#xD;
Jest take it home, and fetch some old stuff to-morrow; and&#xD;
work it good, too. Don't make any more of them heads.'&#xD;
"But Miriam had a piec of ran-new muslin given to her,&#xD;
at home, when ~he repeat~dh~r teacher's orders, with the&#xD;
permission to make as m\n/ beads orilt as she pleased.&#xD;
Whether this act of high-han4ed rebellion was continued, we&#xD;
know not; for, in telling the story, as we have heard her dos,&#xD;
with many amusing accessories, she proceeded no further.&#xD;
This little Incident, it would seem, was the most deeply~ im-&#xD;
pressed upon her memory of any thing connected with her&#xD;
first school-teacher.&#xD;

"A second time was little Miriam introduced within the&#xD;
walls of the academy, but under a new and quite different&#xD;
dynasty. The principal was the kindest hearted and most&#xD;
indulgent of pedagogues, well skilled in mathematics and&#xD;
learned in all classic lore; greatly successful, moreover, in&#xD;
'fitting young men for college,' as the phrase goes. But&#xD;
~the younger fry were left to take' care of themselves, or at&#xD;
most received a kind of desultory instruction from some&#xD;
older pupil, while their misbehavior wasjdndly overlooked&#xD;
by the classical master. Lightly passed her school-days&#xD;
now, but her education, in the true sense 6f the word was&#xD;
advancing. Within the school-house walls, the child's al-&#xD;
reaV observant mind and keen perception of the ludicrous&#xD;
found occupation and food in watching the countenances and&#xD;
conduct of those who surrounded her ;,while her lonely&#xD;
rambles abroad taught her much that your thorough-faced&#xD;
pedagogue utterly ignores.&#xD;
"Her slate did not always present the sums in addition&#xD;
duly set, which it ought. The stiff, allowed locks and long-&#xD;
nosed visages of the serious matter-of-fact young men, in-&#xD;
tently poring over their Virgils and Latin grammars, on&#xD;
the opposite side 'of the room, were often transt'errod by&#xD;
her pencil to its surface. She could no ore keep froni&#xD;
drawing a striking or peculiar set of features, than she could&#xD;
stop her heart's beating; but sh&amp;amp; had no thought of giving&#xD;
pain, and ~was unwilling to have her pictures seen. Some-&#xD;
times a mischievous companion, possessing herse~If of one,&#xD;
would display it. If the unfortunate subject had the happy&#xD;
faculty of taking a joke, he passed it oft' with a laugh. But&#xD;

a matter-of-fact, ~shy, sensitive youth regarded Miriam after~&#xD;
ward with insuperable dread. We well remember one&#xD;
who, finding himself graphically set forth with the quite&#xD;
imaginary addition of a parasol over his head, and bows,&#xD;
'with floating ends on his coat skirts, left school in dismay,&#xD;
and did not again attend.&#xD;
"Her copy-book presented an appearance very unlike&#xD;
those of' her school-mates. She followed no formally set&#xD;
copy, but wrote little poems which had struck her. fl~ncy in&#xD;
reading, interspersed with an occasional verse of her own,&#xD;
the margins being adorned with heads and various devices,&#xD;
something after the ancient fashion, modernly revived, of&#xD;
embellishing books.&#xD;
"In the art of drawing she never, had a master, the only&#xD;
instruction she received being a few hints from a relative&#xD;
gifted with a like talent. The itinerant professors of paint-&#xD;
ing and kindred accomplishments who stopped at times, in&#xD;
her native village, were incapable 0f improving such an en-&#xD;
dowment as hers. Their chefs-d'oeuvres on velvet, their red&#xD;
and green birds, and extraordinary. 'flow~r-pieces' done by&#xD;
theoren~s, their impossible Scripture scenes, gave her infinite&#xD;
amusement. She should have studied with a true a*ist,&#xD;
but no such opportunity presented itself-a subject of deep&#xD;
regret tQ her in after' years, as therein she believed the&#xD;
proper development of her powers could have been fo "&#xD;
Such was the erratic training and chance development of&#xD;
rare-indeed almost unprecedented-original talent; for&#xD;
what humorist has ever so clearly illustrated his own&#xD;
sketches of life and character. The very expression of the&#xD;

(my 'name was Prissilly naturally, bu{ he generally&#xD;
called me " Silly," cause 'twas handier, you know.)&#xD;
Well, he says to me, says he, "Silly," and he looked&#xD;
4       pretty sollem, I tell you, he had a sollern countenance&#xD;
natera1ly.-~and after he got to .be deacon 'twas more&#xD;
so, but since he 'd lost his health he looked sollemer&#xD;
than ever,~ and certainly you wouldn't wonder at it if&#xD;
you knowed how much he underwent. He was&#xD;
troubled with a' wonderful* pain in his chest, and&#xD;
amazing' weakness in the spine of his back, besides the&#xD;
pleurissy in the side, and having the ager a consider-&#xD;
able part of the time, and bein' broke of his rest&#xD;
o' nights 'cause he was so put to 't for breath when he&#xD;
laid down. 'Why its an onacc~untable fact that when&#xD;
that man died he hadent seen a' well day in fifteen&#xD;
year, though when he was married and for five or six&#xD;
year after I shouldn't desire to see a ruggeder man&#xD;
*       Than what he was. But the time I 'm speaking' of he'd&#xD;
* been' out o' health nigh upon ten year, and 0 deai~&#xD;
sakes! 'how he had altered since the first time III ever&#xD;
see him! That was to quilting' to Squire Smith's a&#xD;
spell afore Sally was ma ned.' IL 'd no idee then that Sal&#xD;
Smith was a gwine to be married to Sam Pendergrass.&#xD;
Se 'd ben keeping' company with Mose Hewlitt, for&#xD;
better 'n a year, and every body said that was a settled&#xD;
thing, and lo and behold! all of a scudding she up&#xD;
and took Sam Pendergrass. Well, that was the&#xD;
first time I ever see my husband, and if any body 'd&#xD;
&#xD;
a told me then that I should ever marry him,&#xD;
I should a said-but lawful sakes! I most forgot, I&#xD;
was gwine to tell you what he said to me that evening ,&#xD;
and when a body begins to tell a thing I believe in&#xD;
finishing' on 't some time or other. Some folks have a&#xD;
way of talking' round and round and round for ever-&#xD;
more, and never comm' to the pint. Now there 's&#xD;
Miss Jinkins, she that was Poll Bingham afore she was&#xD;
married, she is~the tejusest individooal to tell a story&#xD;
that ever I see in all my born days. But I was a&#xD;
gwine to tell you what husband said. He says to me&#xD;
says he, "Siliy," says I, "Whgt?" I didn't say&#xD;
"What; Hezekier ?" for I didn't like his name. The&#xD;
first time I ever heard it I near killed myself a laffin.&#xD;
"Hezekier Bedott," says I, "well, IL would give up if&#xD;
I had sich a name," but then you know I had no more&#xD;
idee o' marrying' the feller than you have this minnit&#xD;
o' marrying' the governor. I s'pose you think it 's&#xD;
.cui~us we should a named our oldest son Hezekier.&#xD;
Well, we done it to please father and mother Bedott,&#xD;
it 's father Bedott's name, and he and mother Bedoi±&#xD;
both used to think that names had ought to go down&#xD;
from gi~aer~tion to generation. But we always called&#xD;
him you know. Speaking' o' Kier, he is a bless-&#xD;

I guess. Now don't you never tell nobody that I said&#xD;

that ever was told, though it 's jest of a piece with&#xD;
every thing else she says about me. I guess if every&#xD;
body could see the poetry Iwrit to his memory, no-&#xD;
body wouldent think I dident set store by him.&#xD;
Wauttohear it? WellI'll see if I can sayit; it&#xD;
generally affects me wonderfully, seems to harrier up&#xD;

poetry? how you talk! used to make lots on 't; haint&#xD;

audi writ a piece 'o' poetry and pasted on top on 't.&#xD;

No occasion give for any blame&#xD;
Nor wicked people's jokes.&#xD;
And so it goes on, but I guess I won't stop to say the'&#xD;
rest on 't now, seem' there 's seven and forty verses.&#xD;

Parson Potter and his wife was wonderfully pleased&#xD;
with it, used to sing it to the tune o' Haddem. But I&#xD;

had a numerous number o' chances or not, but there's&#xD;
them livin' that m4ht tell if they was a n4nd to;&#xD;
why, this poetry was writ on account of being joked&#xD;
about Major Ooon, three year after husband died. I&#xD;
guess the generality o' folks knows what was the&#xD;
nature o' Major Coon's feeling toward me, tho' his&#xD;
wife 'and Miss Jinkins does ~say I tried to ketch him.,&#xD;

But now he 's dead! the thought is kuhn'&#xD;
My grief I can't control-&#xD;
He never left a single shilhin&#xD;
His widder to console.&#xD;
But that wa'n't his fault-he was so out o' health for&#xD;
a number o' year afore he died, it ain't to be wondered&#xD;
at he didn't lay up nothin'-.-however it didn't give&#xD;
him no great oneasiness-he never cared much for&#xD;
airthly riches, though Miss Pende'rgrass say~ she heard&#xD;
Miss Jinkins say Deacon Bedott was ~as tight as the&#xD;
skin 6n his back-begrudged folks their vittals when&#xD;
they came to his house! did you ever! why he was&#xD;
the hull-souldest man I ever see in aU my born days.&#xD;
If I'd such a husband as Bill Jinkins was I 'd hold&#xD;
my tongue about my neighbors' husbands. He was a&#xD;
dretful mean man, used to git drunk every day of his&#xD;
life-and he had an awful high temperZused to&#xD;
swear like all possess when he got mad-.and I 'ye&#xD;
heard my husband say-(and he wa'n't a man that&#xD;
ever said any thing that wa'n't true)-i've heard him&#xD;
say Bill Jinkins would cheat his own father out of his&#xD;
eye teeth if lie had a chance. Where was I? 01&#xD;
"His wider to console"-.-ther ain't but one more&#xD;
verse, 't ain't a very lengthy poim. When Parson&#xD;
Potter read it, he says to me, says he-" What did&#xD;
you stop so soon for ?"--but Miss Jinkins told the&#xD;
Crosby's she thought I 'd better a stopt afore I 'd begun&#xD;
p-she 's a purty critter to talk so, I must say. I 'd&#xD;
like to see some poetry o' hern..-I~ guess it would be&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
astonishing' stuff; and mor 'n all that, she said there&#xD;
wasn't a word o' truth in the hull on 't-.-said I never&#xD;
cared tuppence for the deacon. What an everlastin'&#xD;
lie! I Why-wheu he died, I took it so hard I went&#xD;
deranged, and took ~n so for a spell they was afraid&#xD;
they should have to send me to a Lunattic Arsenal&#xD;
But that 's a painful subject, I won't dwell on 't. I&#xD;
conclude as follows:&#xD;
I'll never change my single lot-&#xD;
I think 't would be a sin-&#xD;
The inconsolable widder o' Deacon Bedott,&#xD;

&#xD;
III.&#xD;
~, YES I I remember I promised to tell you the&#xD;
'-'7,&#xD;
cause o wider Jinkinses ennimosity to me---&#xD;
Melissy, pass the bread~-well, you see, Deacon Bedott&#xD;
(he wasn't deacon then though) he come-.help herself&#xD;
to butter, dew-lie come to Wiggletown to teach the&#xD;
deestrict school. He was originally from the Black&#xD;
River entry. His father was a forehanded farmer,&#xD;
and he 'd give Hezekier a complete eddication~he&#xD;
took to larnin' naturally. Is your tea agreeable? I&#xD;
s'pose ther wa'n't his equil for cypherin' no wher&#xD;
round. Well; Squire Smith he was out in them parts,&#xD;
and he got acquainted with Hezekier, and he see that&#xD;
he was aii uncommon capable young man, and so he&#xD;
conducted him to come to Wiggletown and teach school.&#xD;
~ier,~ pass the cheese to Miss Higgins. Don't never&#xD;
eat cheeze! dew tell! well, husband couldn't eat cheeze&#xD;
without impunity dunn' the last years of his life-&#xD;
used to say that it lay like a stun on his stomick; as&#xD;
sure as he eat a piece o' cheese for his supper, he 'd&#xD;
lay awake groanin' all night, if he didn't take some&#xD;
&#xD;
kind of an antidote to percent it. But I was gwine&#xD;
to tell-Well, the day after he come to our place,&#xD;
Scjjuire Smith's folks had a quiltin'-I was there-&#xD;
't wa'n't long af'ore Sally was married (she 'tis Sam&#xD;
Pendergrasses wife~-she was a makin' her cpiilts-&#xD;
though 'twas generally thought she was engaged to&#xD;
Mose flewlet, and as to that matter, it 's my opinion&#xD;
she might better a had him than the one she did have.&#xD;
IL never thought Sam Pendergrass was much-none&#xD;
o' the Pendergrasses aiui't no great shakes, though&#xD;
he 's good enough for Sal Smith. Melissy, why don't&#xD;
you saxve out the sass? That sass ain't ftist-rate---&#xD;
you see, while 't was a dewin'~' Loviney Skinner, she&#xD;
come in with that are subscription paper, to git up a&#xD;
society for "the universal diffusion of elevation among&#xD;
the colored operationo" and while I was looking' at it&#xD;
to see w~ho 'd signed and how much they gi'n, the sass&#xD;
got overdid. But I was gwine to tell about that&#xD;
quilting . Ther was a number o' young folks there-&#xD;
see-there was Prissily Poole (that "s me), Poll Bin&amp;amp;&#xD;
ham (Bill Jinkinses widd~r), Huddy Hewlit (she&#xD;
married Nat Farntash and both on ~em died to~ the&#xD;
westard a i~umber o' years ~ and Sally Smith&#xD;
(Sam Pend~ergrasses wife), and the Peabodys (Jerus&#xD;
shy married Shadrack Dany-but Betsey ain't mar-&#xD;
ried yet, though I s'pose if ever any body tried&#xD;
faithMly to git a husband Bets' Peabody has), and&#xD;
Nab. Hinksten (she 'tis Major Ooon's wife now),&#xD;

though then she wa'n't nothmn' but a milliner's ap.&#xD;
prentice. I remember, I wondered at the Smiths for&#xD;
inviting' her, but they never was pertikkeier who they&#xD;
* went with, and she always had a- wonderful way o'&#xD;
crowdirL' in. See-you heerd, didn't you, how 't she&#xD;
* said I tried to ketch the Major, but he lookt rather&#xD;
higher 'n to marry wider Bedott? He must a lookt&#xD;
consarn-ed high when he took Nab Hinksten! She 's&#xD;
a purty critter to be a tryin' to disperse my character,&#xD;
I dew say! I'll let her know 't iDeacon Bedott's&#xD;
widder ain't a gwine to be put down by the like o' her.&#xD;
What was she, pray tell, in her young days? I make&#xD;
it a 1pint never to say nothing' against nobod~r.-....but&#xD;
truth ain't no slander, think it is? and all creation&#xD;
knows she wa'n't nobody. Why her father was a&#xD;
poor drunken !aack away down in Bottletown, and&#xD;
her mother took in washin', and Nab Hinksten herself&#xD;
worked out for a half a dollar a week, till Miss Potter&#xD;
was down there one time a visiting' Parson Potter's re-&#xD;
lations, and she took pity on her and fetched her up&#xD;
to Wig~letown to live with her; but after a spell she&#xD;
got above dewin' housework and went into Miss Dick-&#xD;
erson s milliner shop, and there she stayed till Zeb&#xD;
Hawkins married her, and after he died o' delirreum&#xD;
trimming, she sot tew to ketch somebody else, and at&#xD;
last she draw'd in Major Coon-he 'd been disappointed&#xD;
('t ain't for me to say who disappointed him) and so&#xD;
he didn't care much who ho married: and now she 's&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Uiajor Coon / 0, deary me, it 's enough to make&#xD;
a body sick to see the airs she puts on. Did you see&#xD;
her come nipping' into meeting' last Sabber day with&#xD;
that are great long ostridge feather in her bunnit, and&#xD;
a shawl as big as a bed kiver? But I could put up&#xD;
with her if she wouldn't slande~~r~better5. She&#xD;
and Miss Jinkins is wonderful intimit now, though I&#xD;
remember when Poll Bingham hild her head high&#xD;
enough above Nab Hinksten, at that quiltin' she&#xD;
didn't scarcely speak to her. Is your cup out? Ta]Fe&#xD;
some more bread.-not no morei? why you don't eat&#xD;
nothing-I 'm afeard you won't make out a supper-&#xD;
well dew take a piece o' the sweetcake-I ain't sure&#xD;
about it bein' good, Melissy made it and she 's apt to&#xD;
git in a leetle tew much molasses-but them nutcakes&#xD;
I know is good, for I made 'em myself; and I dew&#xD;
think I make nuteakes about as good as any body&#xD;
else. Kier's a wonderful favorite o' nutcakes, ain't&#xD;
you Kier? but his father couldn't eat 'em at all for&#xD;
a number o' year afore he died-they were tew rich&#xD;
for his stomick-jest as sure as he eat a nutcake he&#xD;
used to have a sick spell afterward. But I was a&#xD;
gwine to tell how Poll Bingham come to take such a&#xD;
spite against me-well, the beginning ' on 't commenced&#xD;
at that are quilting . In the evening' you see the young&#xD;
men -come. There was Hezekier Bedott-Zeb Haw-&#xD;
kins (he 't was Miss Coon's fttst husband, he got tc~ be1&#xD;
a worthless critter afore he died); and Shubal Gmen&#xD;

my loss is Deacon Bedott's gain. 0! Mr. Crane, how&#xD;
that man did sufThr for a number o' year afore he died;&#xD;
but he was the resignedest critter I ever did see-&#xD;
never grumbled a grain. Parson Potter used to say&#xD;
t was to eddification to come to see him, and hear him&#xD;
converse. He felt wonderful bad about your bein'&#xD;
gone to the westward, Mr. Crane. He used to frequent.&#xD;
ly remark, that he 'd giv more to see Mr. Crane than*&#xD;
ary individdyival he knowed on. He sot a great deal&#xD;
by you-and so did I by Miss Crane. We both on&#xD;
us felt as if we could n't he reconciled to you~livin'&#xD;
away off there-it seemed if we could n't have it so&#xD;
116 way. It's a dretful pity you went there, Mr.&#xD;
Crane. Mabby if you had n't a ~went, yer pardner&#xD;
would n't a died-but what 's did can't be ondid, it 's&#xD;
all for the best. I was ttLrribly overcome when I&#xD;
heerd o' her death--fainted away, and 't was quite a&#xD;
spefi afore I ' come tew. That 's a bad 'clymit, Mr.&#xD;
Cran~it must be a bad clyinit, or the eperdemic, and&#xD;
fever ager wouldn't prevail so there. 'A few year afor&#xD;
husband died, he had quite a nOtion to go to the west-&#xD;
ard. He heerd how well you was a dewin'.-.and then&#xD;
there was Samson Bedott, his cousin (he married Hep.&#xD;

(&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

to be sure the clymit was rather tryin' at fast-but then&#xD;
after you 'd got used to 't, you 'd be ruggeder 'n ever&#xD;
you, was afore-and it w~ such a wonderful entry&#xD;
for agricultifer to grow-~aid 't wasn't nigh so mount-&#xD;
anious as the eastard-the yomandery didn't have to&#xD;
labor no wher nigh so hard as what they did here-&#xD;
just plant your produce and that was the eend on't-&#xD;
't would take care of itself till 't was time to git it in.&#xD;
Well, 'husband was quite fierce to go-and if it had. n't&#xD;
a ben for me, he would, a went, but I wouldn't hear&#xD;
to 't at all. I says to him, says I, "'T wont dew for&#xD;
you to go there, no how-Samson, himself; owns it 's&#xD;
a tryin' clymit-.--and if it 's? tryin' for well hearty folks,&#xD;
how do you 'spose you 'd stan' it? you enjoy poor&#xD;
enough health here, and if you was to go. there you'd&#xD;
enjoy woss yet, what 's agricultifer compared to&#xD;
health?" I was a great deal more consarned. fo:r hus-&#xD;

it's a woman's duty to feel s~,but seems to me I felt&#xD;
it uncommonly. And. no wonder, for my husband&#xD;
was a treshur. 0! Mr. Crane, when I lost him I lost&#xD;
all. And that's what makes me feel to sympathize&#xD;
with you as I dew, Mr. Crane. Our sittywations are&#xD;
so mt~ch alike. I 'spose you feel as if your loss&#xD;

nary one o' them would n't a filled Deacon Bedott's&#xD;

me-ahem..-~but s'posen they should, you know.&#xD;
Whenever my friends begin) to talk to me about&#xD;
changing' my condition, I always tell 'em it's a ~sk-.&#xD;

second pardner.-.without its an individdyival you&#xD;
know 'd when you was young.-.-that makes a difference&#xD;
~-..'t ain't so resky tli en. But after all, Mr. Crane.-.-.it '~&#xD;
a tryin' thing to be without a companionz..ain't it?&#xD;
And then there 's the responsibilitude and bringing&#xD;
up the children~widders complains most o' that.&#xD;
But there 's a wonderful difference in folks about that.&#xD;
Now 't wasn't no great chore for me to bring up my&#xD;
children. Parson P&amp;amp;tter's wife frequently used to&#xD;
say (she had quite a large family, you know), she used&#xD;
to say tome, "Miss Bedott I 'd giv eny, most eny&#xD;

pint never to say' nothing against nobody-*i~nd I am&#xD;
sure I don't wish Miss Jinkins no harm-for all she 's&#xD;
did so much to injure me. I was only gwine to speak&#xD;
o' her way o' bringing' up her children. 'Tis astonish-&#xD;
in' how that critter has managed with them young&#xD;
ones I She 's the miserablest hand I ever did see in&#xD;
all my born days. Why them little plagues was in&#xD;
the streets from morning' till night-Bill and Sam a&#xD;
swearin' and throwing' stuns-and Alviry a racin' and&#xD;
romping' and bothermn' The neighbors. they 'ye got&#xD;
bigger now and ain't quite so troublesome, though&#xD;
they 're bad enough yet-but that ain't to be wondered&#xD;
at-for Miss Jinkins has so much gaddin' to dew ~he&#xD;
hain't no time to tend to her family. But if that was&#xD;
all ther was against her 't wouldn't be so bad. How-&#xD;
ever-~--I don't want to talk about her-truth ain't to&#xD;
be spoken at all times you know-but I will say I&#xD;
should pity any decent man that got her for a wife-&#xD;
'specially if he had children. Speaking' o' children-&#xD;
you must feel Miss Crane's loss dretfufly in takin' care&#xD;
o' yourn. It 's an awful task for a man to manage&#xD;

Mirandy and Seliny is putty well growd up-but then&#xD;

Sister Magwire's a smart woman, tew in her way-but&#xD;
it 's a different kind o' smart from mine. I think her&#xD;
bein' married to such a man has exacted an onfav-&#xD;
orable attendency on her. Mr. Magwire 's a stiddy,&#xD;
well-meanin' ~nan-and has got along amazing' pros~&#xD;

Why, when I writ that affection' ~1legory t~o the memo-&#xD;
ry o' my husband, as true as I live, Mr. Crane, broth.&#xD;
er Magwire laffeci about it right to my face I-said&#xD;
'twas enough to make the deacon groan under ground&#xD;
-did you ever! I felt dretftd hurt about it, but I&#xD;
never laid it up agin him, 'cause I know'd he didn't&#xD;

about yer health, Mr. Crane. What seem~~ to be the&#xD;

rible !-it always scares The to ~leath to hear of any&#xD;
body's havin' a pain in ther chist. Why that very&#xD;
thing was the beginning' 0' my husband's sickness, that&#xD;
finally terminated in his expiration. It ought to be&#xD;
tended tew right oIf Mr. Crane, right off. When&#xD;
husband fust had it, 'twant very bad, and he dident&#xD;
pay no tention to 't-next time 'twas brother woss, and&#xD;
I wanted him to send for the doctor, but he wouldeut&#xD;

Wefl~ the next time he was attacked 'twas dretful bad&#xD;

didn't do a smite o' good-he kept a gittin' woss and&#xD;
woss, and the third day he was so distress it did seem as&#xD;
if every breath he d.raw'd would be the death on him.&#xD;
Jest then old mother Pike come in-she was quite a&#xD;
doctor, you know-and she said he must take skoke&#xD;
berries and rum right off~-ther wasn't nothing' like it&#xD;
for pain in the chist-she always kep it in the house&#xD;
.~-so she goes right hum and fetches over a bottle on't&#xD;
and gin husband a wine glass full. She said he must&#xD;
begin with a purty stiff dqse, ~cause he 'd let it run on&#xD;
so long-axterward a gret spunful night and morning'&#xD;
would be enough. Well, 'tis astonishing' how soon&#xD;
my husband experienced relief Arter that he always&#xD;
took it as long as he lived, and I d~w believe it aflivated&#xD;
his sufferings wonderfully-yes-I hain't a doubt but&#xD;
what if he 'd a took it afore hi~ disorders seated, that&#xD;
man 'd a been alive and well to this day. But what 's&#xD;
did can't be ondid-it 's no use cryin' for spilt miIk~&#xD;
Now, Mr. Crane~ I dew beseech you, as a friend, to&#xD;
take skoke berries and rum afore it 's' tew late. Tern.&#xD;
prance ma; hey? So be I, tew; and you don't&#xD;
s'po~e, dew you, Mr. Crane, that I 'd advise you to take&#xD;
anything that would intosticate you? I 'd die afore&#xD;
I'd dew it. I think tew much o' my repertation and&#xD;
y6urn tew, to do such a thing. But it is the harrniess&#xD;
est stuft' a body can take. You see the skoke berries&#xD;
counterects the alkyhall in the rum, and annyliates&#xD;
all its intosticatin' qualities. We je8t put the ruin on&#xD;
&#xD;
to make it keep. You know skoke berries can't be&#xD;
got in the winter time, so if you want to preserve&#xD;
'em for winters, you 'ye got to put some sort o' spirits&#xD;
tew 'em so~ 's they won't spyl9. So don't you be none&#xD;
afeard to take it, Mr. CraLe. I 'II send you some&#xD;
when I go hum-I always keeps it on hand-and&#xD;
you be faithful and take a great spunful night and&#xD;
mornin'-and if you ain't the better for 't afore long-&#xD;
then I 'in out o' my calkilation-that 's all. You must&#xD;
feel yer loss commonly when ~you ain't well, Mr.&#xD;
Crane. If ever a departed companion 's missed-&#xD;
seems to me it must be when the afflicted survived's&#xD;
sick-'8pecially if its a widiwer that's lost his wife.&#xD;
How awful lonesome you must be here al~ne, when&#xD;
the children 's in bed and the gals has gun off-as I&#xD;
s'pose they frequently dew when evening' comes-and I&#xD;
don't blame them for 't as I know on-its natural for&#xD;
young folks to like to go. How dre~fzd lonesome you&#xD;
must be. Now some men wouldent mind it~ so much&#xD;
-they 'd go abroad and divert ther minds-but you&#xD;
ain't a man to go to taverns and shops and such like&#xD;
places to begwile the time-you're a man that 's above&#xD;
such' things, Mr. Crane-and that 's wlaat makes it so&#xD;
aggrevative for you to ~be without a pardner. I went&#xD;
into the kitchen to dry my feet as I came in-and 0,&#xD;
Mr. Crane! I never did experience such moloneolly&#xD;

't won't be long afore it 'II be out o' kilter every where.&#xD;
Now Betsey Pringle's a clever enough gal fur as I&#xD;
know---but she 's young and onstiddy, and wants&#xD;
looking' tew every minnit. *She lived to Sam Pender~&#xD;
grasses a spell-and Miss Pendergrass told me how't&#xD;
Botsey could dew-but she wanted somebody to her&#xD;
heels t' overlook her all the time-she was such a&#xD;
korless critter-said she couldn't git along with her&#xD;
no way. Now If Sam Pendergrasses wife couldent&#xD;
stan' it with Betsey, it 's a mystery to me how tow&#xD;
young gals like yourn is a gwine to git along with her.&#xD;
They hadn't never had no care, and 't ain't to be suspect-&#xD;
ed they should know how to manage-'t would be&#xD;
cruel to require it on 'em. It needs an experienced&#xD;
woman-and one that takes an interest in things, to&#xD;
keep house right. Thor was one thing hurt my feel-&#xD;
ins amazingly when I was in the kitchen---Betsey was&#xD;
a stewin' punkins for pies-I knowd in a minnit by*&#xD;
the smell, that the critter was a burning on't up. I&#xD;
client say nothin-thought mabby she 'd be put out&#xD;
if I did, cause. I ain't mistress here-but I couldent&#xD;
scercely hold in. I '11 be bound, Mr. Crane, you won't&#xD;
have a punkin pie fit t' eat all winter long-and it&#xD;
makes me feel bad to think on 't-for I make gret ac-&#xD;

a punkin without thinking' on 't---and its tow good to&#xD;

Miss Jinkins. 'T was tow year ago this fall-some.&#xD;
how or other our punkins didn't dew well that year.&#xD;
Kjer said he didn't know whether the seed was poor,&#xD;
or what 'twas-any how, our punkins didn't come to&#xD;
nothing' at all-had to make all my punkin pies out o'&#xD;
squashes-and them ain't no wher nigh as goo~l as pun-&#xD;
kins. Well, one day I see Sam and Bill Jinkin~ go&#xD;
by with a load o' punkins-so I says to Mellissy, says&#xD;
I, "I moan to jest run over and see if Miss Jinkins&#xD;
won't let me have one o' her punkii~s,"-the sight on&#xD;
'em fairly ~akes my mouth water. So I throws on&#xD;
my shaWl and goes over-though I very seldom axed&#xD;
any favors o' her-notwithstandin' she was eternally&#xD;
borrerin' o' m&amp;amp;-why thor want scarcely a day past&#xD;

fact-the times that critter has had my bake pans and&#xD;
my flats and my wash board, ain't to be numbered. I&#xD;
make it a pint never to border when I can help it.&#xD;
Ther is times to be sure-when the best o' housel~eep-&#xD;

on 't-but ~he can't stay to hum long enough to keep&#xD;
things in -any kind o' decent order. But I was gwine&#xD;
to tell how she saved me about the punkin. Well-&#xD;
IL goes over-and IL says, says IL, "Miss Jinkins, IL see&#xD;
you're a gittin' in yer punkins-and I want to know&#xD;
whether\or no you can't spare me one-~ourn's failed,&#xD;
you know." "Well," says she, "we hadn't got more&#xD;
'n enough for our own use-but seem' it's you, IL guess I&#xD;
will let you have one." So she went and fetched in&#xD;
one-quite a small one 't was. "What 's the price on 't.&#xD;
says IL (I dident s'pose she 'd tak any thing, for IL 'd gin&#xD;
her a mess o' turnips a few days afore-but IL thought&#xD;
I'd offer to pay). - "Wha1~ 's the price on 't ?" says IL.&#xD;
"0 nothing' at all," says she. "Lawful sakes 1" says I,&#xD;
"you don't s'pose I want to beg it, dew you? IL meant&#xD;
to pay the money down." "You 'd look well," says&#xD;
she, "a payin' for 't-don't you s'pose I can afford to&#xD;
giv away a punkin ?-purty story if IL can't I"&#xD;
"Well," says I, "thank you a thousand times-~--you&#xD;
must come in to-morrer arter I git my pies made and&#xD;
help eat some.~~ "Well, mabby I will," says she-so&#xD;
IL takes my punkin and goes hum mighty pleased.&#xD;
Well, neit day Melissy and me we cut up the punkin&#xD;
-'twas dretftil small and wonderful thin-and when&#xD;
I come to stew it-my gracious! how it did stew&#xD;
away! The fact is 'twas a miserable 'poor punkin-&#xD;
good punkins don't stew down to nothing' so. Milessy&#xD;
she lookt into the pot and says she to me, says she,&#xD;
&#xD;
1; f&#xD;
&#xD;
I-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Granf'ther grievous! why mar I'm afeard this ere&#xD;
punkin's gwine to exasperate entirely, so ther won't b~&#xD;
nun left on't." Wel],~ sure enough-arter 'twas sifted&#xD;
-as true as the world, Mr. Orane-ther want more'n&#xD;
a pint on't. "Why, mar," Milessy, says she-" 't Wont&#xD;
make more 'n one good sized pie." "Never you fear,"&#xD;
says IL-" IL 'II bet forty gret apples I '11 git three pies&#xD;
out on 't any way." Some folks, you know, puts&#xD;
eggs in punkin pies, but according' to my way o' think-&#xD;
in, tain't no addition. When I have plenty o' punkin&#xD;
IL never use 'em-but Miss Jinkinses punkin turned&#xD;
out so small, IL see I shouldent have nun to speak on&#xD;
without IL put in eggs; so IL takes my punkin and IL&#xD;
stirs in my molasses, and my milk, and my eggs, and&#xD;
my spices, and IL ifils three of my biggest pie-pans.&#xD;
"There," says IL to Melissy, "did n't IL say I'd make&#xD;
three pies, and hadn't IL did it?" "Yes," says she,&#xD;
"but they 7e purty much all ingrejiences, and precious&#xD;
little punkin." Well, we got 'em in the oven, and&#xD;
jest as -IL was gwine to put in the last one, somebody&#xD;
knockt at the door. Melissy was a ha~ndin' on 't to me,&#xD;
and she was rather startled, you know, when she&#xD;
heerd the knock, and she jerked away quite scudding,&#xD;
and spilt about half the pie out. IL wiped it up as&#xD;
- quick as IL could, and Melissy she opened the door,&#xD;
and lo and behold! who should come in but the wid-&#xD;
der Jinkins! Arter she 'd sot a spell she says, says&#xD;
she, "Well, Miss Bedott, how did you make out with&#xD;

in the oven when you come in." I thought, seem' she&#xD;
gin me the punkin, I wouldn't say nothing' about its&#xD;
bein' such a miserable one. Mustent find fault in a&#xD;
gift houses mouth, you know. Well, when my pies&#xD;
was done I takes 'em and sets 'em on the table.-~&#xD;
"Them looks nice," says the wider, says she. "They&#xD;
be nice," says I. I knowed they was nice, for they&#xD;
had everything in 'em to make 'em nice. So I took&#xD;
the thin one that Melissy spilt over, and sot it in the&#xD;
buttery winder to cool, so 's to give Miss Jinkins a piece.&#xD;
I took that cause I knowd 't would cool sooner'n 1?&#xD;
others, on account of its bein' thinner. Well, when&#xD;
my pie was cool, I fetcht it but and sot it afoee Miss&#xD;
Jinkins, an&amp;amp; I gin her a knife and a fork, and says I,&#xD;
"Now help yemelf, Miss Jinkins," and I tell you, the&#xD;
way she helpt herself was a caution. Melissy lookt&#xD;
as if she was ready to burst out lalfin; I was raly&#xD;
* afeard she would. Arter she 'd put in about half the&#xD;
pie, she laid down her knife and fork, and says 'she,&#xD;
"This ere pie ain't cool enough yet according' to my&#xD;
way of thinkin'-I never did fancy warm punkin pies,"&#xD;
So she riz up to go. "0 don't go, Miss Jinkins," says~&#xD;
I," dew wait a spell 'and I'll set it out door-it 'll cool&#xD;
there in a few. minnits-you gin me the punkin and I&#xD;
want you should have yer share o' the pie." "Mercy&#xD;

pie-I never di~1 fanc4r thin punkin pies-these ere tew '11&#xD;
be as much as I want." And jest as true as I live&#xD;
and breathe, the critter actilly took them tew pies and&#xD;
sot 'em crossways-one a top o' other and marched&#xD;
off with 'em! When she got to the door she turned&#xD;
round, and says she-" Now Miss Beaott, whenever&#xD;
you want any~ little favor, such as a punkin or any&#xD;
thing else I've got that you hain't got-don't scruple&#xD;
to ask for 't-~it always affords me the greatest gratifica&#xD;

wilh-.I always thought I should like to hear one o'&#xD;
them kind o' lectures. (They enter the lecture room.)&#xD;
Less go back side, as fur away from the stove as we&#xD;
can git, it 's so awful hot here, ~What! you afeard o'&#xD;
the men folks, Mirandy? I don't care if 'tis right&#xD;
amongst The loafers and boys. I never see that man&#xD;
yit, nor boy another, 't ~' 11 was afeard on. Gracious&#xD;
sakes alive! dew look o' them dead folkses head~ on&#xD;
the table! What awful looking things they be!&#xD;
Made o' plaster;' hey? Well, I ?m glad on 't-~shan't&#xD;
feel so disgusted looking' at 'em as I should if they&#xD;
was rael heads. What a curus looking' critter that&#xD;
lecturer is, ain't he? How he has got his hair all&#xD;
scraped up! makes him look kind p' skairt. Name 's&#xD;
Mr. Vanderbump, ain't it? Wonder if that are wo-&#xD;
man without a bunr~it on 's Miss Vanderbump? What&#xD;
an awful big head she 's got! 1E1~r forbid 's all bare,&#xD;
te~-how it sticks out! Sign of intellect? Goody&#xD;
grievous! I wouldn't for that. If. I had such a&#xD;
humbly 'face I 'd keep it kivered up, wouldent you?&#xD;
Dew see! there comes Sam Pendergrasses 'wife, with&#xD;
that everlastin' boy o':hern. She takes that young&#xD;
one evemy where-~and lie always acts like Sanko. I'&#xD;
gtiess ~ 'II find it purty warm there, right aside o'&#xD;
the stove. Look3 Seliny! there 's Cappen Canoot-&#xD;
I'll bet a cookeyhe called for me. Well, I 'in glad I 'd&#xD;
come away afore he 'd got there~, I 'don't want none&#xD;
* o' ~ki~ company. I don't know what he ezpects to&#xD;
&#xD;
gain by sticking' round me so. I hain't never gin him&#xD;
no incurridgement, and don't intend tew. Of all&#xD;
things! if there ain't Maj~ Coon's wif6, with that&#xD;
flabbergasted old red hood o' hem on!, Dew, for&#xD;
pity's sake, see how she sails along. And then, there&#xD;
comes the Major grinin' along behind Jier, as if she&#xD;
was the eend o' the law. I s'pose if ever a man was&#xD;
completely under his wife's thumb, Major Coon is.&#xD;
But they say he thinks she 's clear perfection; well,&#xD;
it 's well ther 's somebody thinks so. Kier was tellin' a&#xD;
speech old Green made about her t' other day. Old&#xD;
Green's a musical old critter, you 'know; well, he was~&#xD;
in Smith's store, and Kiev was there, and Major Coon,&#xD;
and a number of other men. The Major was a talking'&#xD;
about his wife-you know how he 's forever talking'&#xD;
about her-well, he was a praising' on her up, tellin'&#xD;
how smart, and keen, and indmstroims she was, and all&#xD;
that. Byrne by he went out, and says old Green, says&#xD;
he, "The Major does think his wife 's the very dyvi4&#xD;
and so do i; tew." Old Green 'd no bizness'to said it,&#xD;
but when Kier told on 't, I couldent help laffi~a'. Well.&#xD;
done! If there ain't the wider Jinkins! I wonder&#xD;
if ever any thing goes on in Wiggletown without that&#xD;
woman's bein' on the spot! I never did see a body&#xD;
so beset to go as she is. If I was her I woutd stay to&#xD;
hum jest once, so 'e to see how 't would seem-would.&#xD;
entyon?&#xD;
There I Mr. Vauderbump is a~wine to begin! (The&#xD;

this part of the performance, Mr. Crane enters.) Se-&#xD;

thoughtless, and don't think on 't-but that am' sixr-&#xD;

This 'ere phreenyology 's the curusest thing I ever&#xD;
did see. Did you ever see any thing to beat it-how&#xD;
he can tell an individiwal's character so egzactly by&#xD;
the looks o' their heads? don't seem to me as if it&#xD;
could be so-does it to you? I can't realize I 'ye got&#xD;
such a numerous number of organs in my head-can&#xD;
you ?.-O, Mr. Crane; what a musical man you be!&#xD;
you 'II make me die a laffin! Seliny! jest hear what&#xD;
your par says. I axed him if he could raelize he had&#xD;
so many organs in his 4aeacl.-and he said how 't&#xD;
t' other day when he had such a tumble cold in it, it&#xD;
seemed is if there was organs, and fiddles, and drums,&#xD;
and every thing else in 'v-did you ever ?-I wish&#xD;
you 'd a ben here sooner, Mr. Crane, to hear Mr. Van-&#xD;

how flier characters was according' ther heads.&#xD;
That are big head-the one that runs upto .such a&#xD;
peak on top-he says that 's Scott the celebrated au&#xD;

parson Potter-Mr. Scott must a' ben a smart man to&#xD;
write 'em. That are small curus shaped one on the&#xD;
corner--that 's the head of an underwitted critter that&#xD;
died in one o' the poor houses-hain't got no intellec-&#xD;
tible organs at all. That are skull, that sets behind&#xD;
Mr. Scott-that 's Old Gibbs the pyrit, that was exte-&#xD;
cuted a number o' years ago-he was a terrible old&#xD;
killing. Mr. Vanderbump said that was old Gibb's&#xD;
skull positively 'bony ftcZy. That is-it 's giniwine&#xD;

are head that sets aside.o' the commentater-the one&#xD;
that ?~ got such a dangling' under lip and fiat forrid and&#xD;
runs out to such a pint beWind-that 's old mother&#xD;
O'Killem~ ~the Irish woman that murdered so many&#xD;
folks-she was an awful critter. He said 't wasn't to&#xD;
be disputed though, that she '4 done a master sight o'&#xD;
good to menkind-he reckoned they ought to raise a&#xD;
monument tew her-' cause any b~dy that lookt at her&#xD;
head couldent persiune no~ longer to doubt the truth o'&#xD;
phreenyology. He told us to observe the. shape on&#xD;
perticlerly. You see the forrid 's dretful fiat-wefl,&#xD;
that shows how 't the intellectible faculties is intirely&#xD;
wanting . But he didn't call itforrid. He called it the&#xD;
hossfrontis. I s'pose that' 's 'cause its shaped more&#xD;
like a hoss than a human critter-animal propensi-&#xD;
tudes entirely predominates, you know. Thai~ 's what&#xD;
makes it stick out so on the back side-that 's the&#xD;

tellin' about her, 'cause I 'ye read all about her in&#xD;
"Horrid Murders "-a book I 'ye got-it 's the inter-&#xD;
estinest book I 'ye read in all my life. It 's enough to&#xD;
make yer hair stand on eend. I 'ye ben over it I&#xD;
guess half a dozen times-and it seems interestiner&#xD;
every time. Husband got it of a pedlar the year afore&#xD;
he diecI,~ and he used to take an amazing' deal o' com-&#xD;
fort readixi' on 'to Time and agin I 'ye knowd that&#xD;
man to lie awake half the night arter lie '4 ben reading'&#xD;
in "Horrid Murders." He was narvous, you know-&#xD;
I feel wonderfully attached to that book 'cause 't was&#xD;
such a favorite o' husband's. Every thing 't was dear&#xD;
to husband is dear to me-Mr. Crane-that 's one rea-&#xD;
son why I set~ store by you-he reckoned on you s~&#xD;
much. I 'II lend you that book Mr. Crane-you 'II&#xD;
delighted with it. You can jest step in with me when&#xD;
we go* hum and I '11 let you take it. You '11 be&#xD;
amazingly pleased with the account o' Miss O'Killem.&#xD;
She murdered five husbands and a number of other in-&#xD;
dividiwals, and it tells all how she killed each one on&#xD;
'em. Some she cut thor throats and some she burnt,&#xD;
and some she chopped to pieces. 0 'tis awful interest-&#xD;
in. What did you say, Mr. Crane? That gal with&#xD;
such red cheeks setting' right by the table, do you mean&#xD;
0, that is Kesier Winkle, she always contrives to get&#xD;
a seat where she 'Thbe seen. She takes quite a notion&#xD;

Bedott ain't a feller be drawd in by a puny face-~&#xD;
he wants something besides that~-4ho' I never thought&#xD;
she was so wonderful handsome, do you-her cheeks&#xD;
is red to be sure, but every body can have such a col-&#xD;
or if they want-you understand, hey! tho' tain't for&#xD;
me to say she pai4s, never standing' there is them that&#xD;
says so. I 'm very glad Kier don't think o' havin' on&#xD;
her-I never did like the Winkles. Old Winkle 's a&#xD;
hard old case, and they dew say Kesier 's considerable&#xD;
like him.&#xD;
Ther~! I guess Miss Pendergrass has got roasted&#xD;

-don't see'what she wants to crowd in here for-&#xD;

Mrs. Pendergrass and takes the one she left.) Good&#xD;

about one thing relating' to her. He says she killed&#xD;

't wa'n't so-she stomped on. her-I remember just&#xD;

handkercher! Did you see her when she come in?&#xD;
Dident she cut a sludge, tho'? I never did see such&#xD;

you see any body put on such airs as she does, yo~ may&#xD;

-how did you hear ?-told you herself; hey? Is she&#xD;
gwine to have married folks and young folks both?&#xD;
Well, them 's the right kind o' parties-enough sight&#xD;
pleasanter 'n where they 're all married folks or all&#xD;
young folks-don't you think so? Well, I should&#xD;
think she'd hale a party-hain'v never gin a reglax&#xD;
smasher yit-and they 're able to dew it. It 's pleasant&#xD;
to git a body's friends and nabors together-has an&#xD;
attendance to permote sociabilitude. I always thought&#xD;
'Miss Coon was a ~ice woman. Folks has a good deal&#xD;
to say about her, cause she was a hired gal when she&#xD;
was young-but I never thought 't was any thing&#xD;
against her-Miss Jinkins used to run her down dret.&#xD;
fully afore they got to be 'so 'intimit-and whenever&#xD;
she used to begin a slanderin' Miss Coon afore me, I&#xD;
always made it a pint to stan' up for her. I 'ye some-&#xD;
times thought she was rather affected-hain't you ?-&#xD;
but then you know it 's natural for some folks to be&#xD;
affected-I hope Mr. Crane's setting' with me to-night&#xD;
won't make any talk. I shouldent wonder tho'. if it&#xD;
should-it~don't take nothing' to make a story in Wig-&#xD;

when he come and sot down by me-t' wouldn't a ben&#xD;
perlite-s'pose you 're heerd he 'd called t' our house&#xD;
a number o' times? fllain't ?-well that 's curus-it 's&#xD;

I&#xD;
he 's come a purpose to go hum with some o' the gals.&#xD;
There! the lecture's out-Seliny, wait a minnit till the&#xD;

&#xD;
Kesie~ Win]de-why. Kier what dew you mean, by&#xD;
offering' the cold pork to Mr. Crane? jest as if he&#xD;
wanted pork for his tea! you see Kier 's ben over to&#xD;
the Holler to-day on hizness with old uncle. Dawson,&#xD;
and he come hum with quite an appertite-says to&#xD;
me, says he "Mar, dew ~et 6n some cold pork and&#xD;
taters, for I 'm as hungry as a bear." Lenime fill up&#xD;
yer cup, Mr. Crane. Melissy, bring on that are pie, I&#xD;
guess it 's warm by this time. There! I don't think&#xD;
any body 'd say that punkin was burnt a steinn.&#xD;
Take another pickle, Mr. Crane. 0,1 was agwineto&#xD;
tell what Carlin~ Gallup said about Kesier Winkle,&#xD;
Canine Gallup was a inanty maker-what, Kier?&#xD;
rather apt to talk? well, I know she was-but then&#xD;
she used to be sowin' 't old Winkle's about half the&#xD;
time, and she know'd pitrty well what went on there&#xD;
-yes--i know sowin' gals is generally tattlers. It 's a&#xD;
turnible bad trait in any body-'specially in them--&#xD;
they ain't no bizness to go round from house to&#xD;
house a teUin' what guz on among folks that finds&#xD;
'em then bread and butter. I never incurnidge 'em in&#xD;
it. When I have manty makers to work for me-as&#xD;
sure as they undertake to insiniwate any thing against&#xD;
any o' my nabors---I tell ye, I shot 'ems up quicker-.-.&#xD;
but I was gwine to tell what Canine Gallup said--&#xD;
Canine was a very stiddy gal-she was rnan'ied about&#xD;
a year ago-mar~ied Jo Bennet-Philanden Bennet's&#xD;
uom-you remember Phil Bennet, don't you, Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Crane~? he 't was killed so scudding over to Gander.&#xD;
field? Though come to think, it must a ben arter&#xD;
you went away from here. He 'd moved over to&#xD;
Ganderfield the spring afore he was killed. Well, one&#xD;
day in hayin'4ime he was to work in the hay-field-&#xD;
take another piece o' pie, Mr. Crane-~---0 dew-I insist&#xD;
on 't. Well, he was to work in the hay-field, and he&#xD;
fell off the hay-stack. I s'pose 't wouldn't a killed&#xD;
him if it hadent a ben for his contain' kersmash onto a&#xD;
jug that was a setting' on the ground aside o' the stack.&#xD;
The spine of his back went right on to the jug and&#xD;
broke it-broke his~back, I mean-not the jug-that&#xD;
wasn't even cracked-curus! wa'n't it? 'T was quite&#xD;
a comfort to Miss. Bennet in her affliction-'t was a jug&#xD;
she vallyed-one 't was ~aer mother's. His bein'2ki]led&#xD;
so was a turnible blow to Miss Bonnet, the ~ircum-&#xD;
stances was so aggravatin'.~T~wnit a piece o' poetry&#xD;
on the occasion and sent it tow her; she said 't was&#xD;
quite consolin'. It says:&#xD;
O Gauderfield!&#xD;
Where is thy shield&#xD;

Why! 't was ~a common report for better 'n a year&#xD;
afore he was killed, that Phil Bennet was a gittin on-&#xD;
steady, but I never let Miss Bennet know 't I had any&#xD;
such idee. She and me was always quite intinait.&#xD;
She was Lorainy Perce, old Peter Perce's darter; you&#xD;

hard when her husband was killed; she went into&#xD;
awful deep mournin~-mournin' -was becomixi' tew her,&#xD;
she was a dark completed woman; ai~d she wasn't&#xD;
satisfied with w~arin' mourning herself; 't wa'n't enough,&#xD;
she even put black caJiker bed-kivers onto her bed.&#xD;
I remember she had a black canton crape gownd all&#xD;
trimmed with crape; but she didn't wear her mourn&#xD;
in' long, for she got married agin in about three&#xD;
months-married a man by the name o' Higgins-.&#xD;

How dew you do, Mr. Smith? Ben here long? I 'm&#xD;
sorry I was out when you came-~glad you stayed 'till&#xD;
Igot back tho'. When did you git home front Var.&#xD;

parents? So you mist that are all-killin' genteel&#xD;
party last night? Well, I guess you dident lose much&#xD;
.-'t ain't no credit to nobody to go to such a place.&#xD;
Sam Pendergrasses wife 's ben a tellin' me about it,&#xD;
she was there, and of all the strains ever I heerd on I&#xD;
should think that was the cap sheef. Why wasn't&#xD;
I there? 'cause I don't sociate with such company as&#xD;
the Coons. I wasn't invited, to be sure-she 'd as soon&#xD;
a thought of inviting' the governor as me. I should.&#xD;

THE WIDOW      "SETS HER CAP."        89&#xD;
Coon used to be a hired gal in her young days! and&#xD;
now sence she 's got a hyst in the world, she tries to&#xD;
cut a spludge and make folks think she s a lady-.&#xD;
but any body- that 's used to good company, can see&#xD;
in a minnit that she 's no lady. They say the way&#xD;
she performed last night was a caution. She had a&#xD;
gret long ostridge feather in her head, and she paraded&#xD;
round like a grannydear-bowin' and smiin' and&#xD;
curchyin' with as much dignitude as if she 'd a ben the&#xD;
queen o' Sheby-wa'n't it affable? If I ~d a ben&#xD;
there I know I should a snorted right out in her face.&#xD;
Old Crane was there texw, pokin~ round among the&#xD;
gals-.-.mighty partickler to Kesier Winide, they say.&#xD;
Did you ever I and his wife hadn't ben dead but six&#xD;
months! ain't it awful? Well, I 'm glad I 'ye got rid&#xD;
o' the critter at last. He 's ben sticking' round me ever&#xD;
since he come here-and it did seem as if I should go&#xD;
crazy, he 's so terrible disagreeable-but I gin him a&#xD;
check on the towpath 't other day-and I rather&#xD;
guess he '11 lemme alone arter this. Kesier Winkle I&#xD;
ain't it reedickelous? I don't see what he could&#xD;
fancy about her, do you? ther ain't nothing' of her but&#xD;
her purty face-and I never thought that was so awful&#xD;
handsome as some folks does. Her red cheeks is her&#xD;
only beauty, and they dew say them ain't natural. But&#xD;
I don't want to hurt Kesiah Winkle-she 's an un-&#xD;
offensive, simple critter-I shall pity her if' she gits&#xD;
Tim Crane, he 's the meanest of all created critters.&#xD;

IL knowed him in his ~young days. IL mean when he&#xD;
was ratherr young, and I was very young indeed. I&#xD;
knowed him always till he went to the West-and&#xD;
I 'd as soon think o' havin' the "old boy" as him.&#xD;
He ~don't know nothirt' only how to make money-&#xD;
o yes he does to-he knows how to keep it. Of all&#xD;
stingymortals he 's the stingiest. Husband dispised&#xD;
him-used to say, Tim Crane was so tight he fairly&#xD;
begrr~dged the air he breathe&amp;amp;-and it 's a fact. Massy&#xD;
tew me!. it does seem unaccountable how any body&#xD;
can be so beset to get married as to take up with him&#xD;
-don't it? He 's the consarndest old gump tew 't&#xD;
ever was-no intellectibiity at all. I always knowed&#xD;
he was a dretful ninny, but, I dident think he w~s so&#xD;
awful silly as he is till 't other night at the ?hreeny-&#xD;
ogical lecture. He come and sot down by me; I was&#xD;
terribly provoked to have him a sticking' round me in&#xD;
public so, but I couldn't help it, you know; I was&#xD;
purty haughty tew him, I tell ye.. Well, if you '11&#xD;
believe it-as true as Let here-when the lecturer was&#xD;
tellin' about the organs in folkses heads, old Crane&#xD;
thought he meant them are music organs-it 's a fact;&#xD;
I never was so disgusted in my life. Well, he ain't&#xD;
worth talking' about, and I make it a pint never to talk&#xD;
about nobody. I eny most wish you had a ben to&#xD;

Jinkins and old Dawson? tribbilation!! Well, she 's&#xD;
been ravin' distracted to git married ever since her&#xD;
husband died, and arter all, she couldn't git nobody&#xD;
but that poor decripped, superanimated old feller. If&#xD;
she wasn't dretful anxious to git married she wouldent&#xD;
take him. Melissy, dear, go down seller and git some&#xD;

Melissy-~-help- yourself to apples, Mr. Smith. II can&#xD;
tell you 'a circumstance that actilly took place once-&#xD;
that '11 show you what an ignorant old heathen he is.&#xD;
His wife used to belong to Parson Potter's church,&#xD;
and once in a while he used to come to meeting' with&#xD;
her, and he always used to go to sleep as soon as the&#xD;
sermon begun, and sleep till meeting' was out-well,&#xD;
one Sabberday old Dawson was to meetin'-and Par.&#xD;
son Potter preached some doctrinal pint-I don't now&#xD;
remember what was the theme of his subject-but&#xD;
any way, arter he 'd gin out his text, says he,&#xD;
"Brothrin-.the subject under consideration this&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WIDOW"5ETS HER GAP."             98&#xD;
morning' is one o' the biggest importance, and I 'ye&#xD;
gin it my unmitigated attention for a number o' year&#xD;
-but I 'm sorry to say, the commontaters don't, agree&#xD;
with me." Well, old Dawson heerd that-and then&#xD;
he dropt asleep as usual. The next arterrioon Miss&#xD;
Potter had company-what 's called a "deacon party,"&#xD;
you know-that isp-all 'the deacons and ther wives.&#xD;
There was Deacon Kenipe and his wife, Deacon Crosby&#xD;
and his wife, Deacon Whipple and his wife, and Deacon&#xD;
Bedott and me. Well, as we was all a setting' there&#xD;
about the middle o' the afternoon, who should come&#xD;
jn but old uncle Dawson, luggin' a mortal gret saSs-&#xD;
basket-." Well Parson," says he, "you &amp;amp;dd yesterday&#xD;
in meeting' how 't the common tater8 didn't agree with.&#xD;
ye-so lii 'ye fetched you some oncommor&amp;amp; ones-the&#xD;
very be~ that ever was growd-for I reckoned "t was&#xD;
tew bad you should be obleeged to live on common,&#xD;

They call em "Harrington blue-skins"~-you needent&#xD;
be feared but what they 'II agree with. ye-ye might&#xD;
eat em all day, and not feel a grain the woss fc~ 't."&#xD;
Now, Mr. Smith, diat 's a fact-I was knowi~ to 't&#xD;
-Parson Potter, he thanks him over and over agin-.&#xD;
and we all contrived to keep our faces strait till he 'd&#xD;
got out o' the house-and then, what a roarin' ther&#xD;
was! Parson Potter told us never to mention it in&#xD;

creation-cause the old man meant well-but some&#xD;
how or other it got out-such things will; you know.&#xD;
But, as Deacon Whipple remarked-it 's lamentable&#xD;
that any body in this free and enlightened kintry&#xD;
should be so blind and ignorant. But he 's good&#xD;
enough for wider Jinkins any day-don't ~rou say&#xD;
so? Well, 'what is Wiggletown a comm' tew? roll&#xD;

The last news that I had from Wiggletown, was&#xD;
that Melissa is soon to be married to the worthy Mr.&#xD;
Jupiter Smith; and that Kier is engaged to Selina&#xD;
Crane. It is supposed that the widow never would&#xD;
have given her consent to these matches, had it not&#xD;
been for the interference of Mr. and Mrs. Magwire,&#xD;
who have at last induced her to give up her opposi-&#xD;
tion to the wishes of her children. She, however, con-&#xD;
tinues to growl about it occasionally, and has become&#xD;
perfectly " dizgu.~ted" with Wiggletown and every body&#xD;
in it, declaring, that "it ain't what it used to be-all&#xD;
run down-not fit for respectable people to live in-&#xD;
and she don't mean to have notbin' to dew with no~&#xD;
body in a place where every body 's trying' to injure&#xD;
her, and put her down-and so."&#xD;

-b~i~t some h.ow I don't like the idee. Melissy's&#xD;

opposed to Kier's marrying' into that family-but he&#xD;
was so determined on 'tI gin up my opposition and&#xD;
tried to make the best on 't. But I can 't be entirely&#xD;

he 's so mortal mean. Dident know it? well, then,&#xD;
yo4 don't know him as well as I dew. Why, I 'ire&#xD;
been acquainted with him ever sence he was quite a&#xD;
young man, and I can testify 't he was always as tight&#xD;
as a drum-head. How else did he make his money,&#xD;
pray? he never could a did it by his wits, for he hain't&#xD;
none. Yes-I always knowd Tim Crane-so did my&#xD;
poor husband-he used to have dealing with him, and&#xD;
he said, that of all born skin-flints 't ever he had to do&#xD;
with, Tim Crane was the biggest. Yes-I always&#xD;

should say 't I was a tryin' to ketch him !.-'t is scan-&#xD;

But what she says ain't worth minding . 'T is curus&#xD;

got married to Kesier Winkle-though 't was a most&#xD;
reedidious piece o' business, wasn't it? To think o'&#xD;
his marrying' that foolish flirt of a gal! young enough&#xD;
to be his darter, tew! But I rejoiced from the bottom&#xD;
o' my heart when it took place-for, thinks me, folks '11&#xD;
stop ther gab about him and me now. You see, he 'd&#xD;
been sticking' round me ever ~sence he came back here&#xD;
-and ther was considerable talk that him and me&#xD;
was a gwine to make a match-and 't was very dis-&#xD;

done all in my power to give him to understand that&#xD;
his attentions was dizagreeable tew me-but somehow&#xD;
another he wouldn't take the hint. I didn't want&#xD;
him to offer himself tew me, you know. I always&#xD;

how much foundation ther was for 't-but don't let it&#xD;

the opportunity one night when I was alone, to come&#xD;
over t' our house. I generally contrived to keep&#xD;
Melissy or Keir in the room when he came there; and&#xD;
I 'spose he' d noticed it, for lie come over' a singing'&#xD;

ye I was mad when I see the critter come in. I&#xD;
treated him as cool as a cowcumber; but neverstandin'&#xD;
all that, if you '11 bleve it, he 'up~ and popped the ques.&#xD;

begged to be egscused; but he wouldent take no for&#xD;
au answer; and so I was obleeged to be purty hash&#xD;
with him and told him I didn't want nothing to dew&#xD;
with him, and wished he 'd reiterated and leave~ me'&#xD;

c~sctppintecZ 'me, as they say. ])isappinted I it looks&#xD;

to be talked about as I be, ain't it? But I 'ye always&#xD;
ben the subjick o' slander ever since I lived here, and&#xD;
that 's since IL was quite a gal. What a terrible place&#xD;
for talking , Wiggletown is, though I a regular slander&#xD;
mill. It 's a great deal woss than it used be-and&#xD;
't was always bad enough. I'm perfectly disgusted&#xD;
with the place, especially sence them stories about old&#xD;
Crane and me. It makes me outrageous to be lied.&#xD;
about so by such folks as old Dawson's wife and Miss&#xD;
Major Coon. Miss Coon-she don't like me cause I&#xD;
hadn't never knuckled tev~r her. You. know she thinks&#xD;
she 's a great character sence she married Major Coon.&#xD;
But I can tell her ~' I ain't so fond o' pork as to eat hog.&#xD;

Wiggletown. I 'm completely disgusted with it, and&#xD;
don't mean to live there no longer if I can help it.&#xD;
I 'ye ben some time considering' what 's best to dew,&#xD;

her son 's gone, for he ain't no favorite o' mine. He 's&#xD;
growed upto be rather a clizagreeable young rlaan-&#xD;
always pokin' fun at every body. He takes after his&#xD;

hardly time to growl about the weather. I assure&#xD;
you I feel forlorn, enough to-day. Probably more so,&#xD;
for having just returned from a visit of a week at&#xD;
father's; and home is so much pleasanter to me than&#xD;
any other place, that I am always discontented for a&#xD;

I suppose you would like to know what the good&#xD;
folks at Scrabble HilLa~ doing; so I '11 tell you as&#xD;
far as I know. Father and mother get on about after&#xD;
the old sort, and there seems to be no great change&#xD;

WIDOW BEDOTT PAPER~&#xD;
&#xD;
Sniffles, the Baptist minister, lost his wife about two&#xD;
months ago, and his personal appearance has~,greatly&#xD;
improved' since that afflictive event (no uncommon&#xD;
thing as respects widowers, I believe). The Footes have&#xD;
sold out, and gone to Wisconsin, and-.well I believe,&#xD;
you have now all the. village news, excepting one&#xD;
piece of information, and that, as it is the most im-&#xD;
portant, I have reserved till the last. A distinguished&#xD;
stranger arrived a~ Scrabble Hill some two weeks&#xD;
since. Who do you guess it is? Why, no less a&#xD;
personage than the Widow Bedott, interesting relict&#xD;
of Deacon Hezekiah Bedott. She . in-&#xD;
flicted herself upon father's folks for the whole winter.&#xD;
What a time they 'II have of it, won't they? Mother&#xD;
is so well disposed, that she tries tQ put up with it&#xD;
cheerfully; but neverthelessit is pretty evident that&#xD;
she looks upon Aunt Bedott as a prodigious bore.&#xD;
She had been there but two or three days when' I&#xD;
went home, and she did ~not appear overjoyed to s6e&#xD;
me. For some reason or 'other she does n't take a&#xD;
particular fancy to me. Mother says it 's because I&#xD;
teaze her sometimes. Bu~ there is something so de-&#xD;
cidedly ric1~about Aunt Silly, that I can not for my life&#xD;
help having a little fun at her expense occasionally.&#xD;
,On Sunday morning I said to her, when mother was n't&#xD;
by, "Well, aunty, where do you go to meeting to-&#xD;
d~y ?" "Where do I go to nieetin' I" said, she "what&#xD;

meeting' ?" "Oh," said 1, "I thought perhaps you1d&#xD;
like to hear Elder Sniffles, he 's such an interesting&#xD;
preacher." "What I" said she, "rae go to the Baptist&#xD;
meeting ! I hope you ain't in earnest, Jeff; w~hy I 'd as&#xD;
soon go to the theater as go there. I have a suffering'&#xD;
contempt for the Baptists. ~Uhey think nobody can't&#xD;
git to heaven Without bein' dipped, dipping' 's a savin'&#xD;
audience with them. Why, come to thir~k, I remem-&#xD;
ber that Elder Sniffles. When I was here afore, yer&#xD;
mother and me was in to Mr. ilugle's one evenin'-&#xD;
they 're Baptists ain't they? and Elder Sniffles&#xD;
and his wife come i~there to call. If my memory&#xD;
serves me, he 's rather a tall, scrawny man, with eyes&#xD;
that looks like a couple o' peeled onions, and kind o'&#xD;
squintin' tew, and seems to me he had n't no hair&#xD;
~hardly." ~" 0 I" said, I "you 'd scarcely knew him&#xD;
now, he 's gota wig and wears spectacles, which im-&#xD;
proves his appearance vastly." "Well, I should think&#xD;
it needed improvin'," said she.&#xD;
"By the way, aunty," said I, "did you know that&#xD;
Mrs. Sniffles was dead?" "You don't say so!" said&#xD;
she. "Yes," said I: "she died only a few weeks ago.&#xD;
Ifee'l sorry for the elder-he must be so iQilesome."&#xD;
"So do I," said she, with a sigh. "It 's a dreadful&#xD;
thing to. lose a companion, and I s'pose the Baptists&#xD;
feel it as much as any body." "Undoubtedly," said&#xD;
I; "Elder Sniffles seems deeply afflicted-his sermons,&#xD;
they say h~e been more. interesting than ever, since&#xD;

his loss: something mournfully solemn about them."&#xD;
-* IL went on for some time, dilating upon the elder's&#xD;
eloquence and talents, and loneliness and all that. I as~&#xD;
sure you~[ talked pretty fast; for fear'm~ther 'd come in&#xD;
before I could say all I wanted t~.-.$nd I was afraid&#xD;
she 'd throw all the fat in the fire. / At length aunt&#xD;
Silly ~aid that I 'd raised her curiosity to such a pitch&#xD;
that she really felt quite a desire to hear the elder preach&#xD;
-she had a good notion to go to the Baptist meet-&#xD;
ing for once. Of course I offered my services as es-&#xD;
cort. Shortly a~er mother came in, and was quite sur-&#xD;
prised when Aunt Bedott announced her intention of&#xD;
going to the Baptist meeting. "What '5 your notion ?"&#xD;
paid mother. "Oh 1" said aunty, "Jeff's excited my&#xD;
curiosity so much about Elder Sniffles, that I feel as&#xD;
if I 'dlike to go and hear him preach." M~the~looked&#xD;
at me for an explanation..-.so I thought my best course&#xD;
wa~ to own up-for I knew that mother would n't ex-&#xD;
posh me, and tell Aunt Bedolt that I was hoaxing&#xD;
her, as it would serve to increase her antipathy to me,&#xD;
which mother was anxious to do away. Therefore IL&#xD;
remarked that I 'd been telling aunt Silly, what an do-&#xD;
0&#xD;
quent man elder Sniffles was. Mother said nothing&#xD;
then, but as soon as we were alone, she took me to task&#xD;
roundly. However IL carried the point, and aunty and&#xD;
I went off to the Baptist meeting. We had a seat very&#xD;
near the pulpit. As usual, the elder, whaled away&#xD;
through his tiose-thumped the desk, an&amp;amp; went over&#xD;

and over again with the same thing-using a little dif-&#xD;
ferent words each time, without ever making the most&#xD;
remote approach to any thing like the shadow of an&#xD;
idea. But it would have done you good to see with&#xD;
what devout and earnest attention Aunt Bedott regard-&#xD;
ed him tall the time. Once he was deeply affected,&#xD;
and sobbed in a manner that attracted d universal atten-&#xD;
tion. lit was on his making the very original observa-&#xD;
tion that "this was a changing world, and we couldn't&#xD;
calculate with any degree of certainty upon any&#xD;
thing 1" When we were going home, Aunt Bedott&#xD;
said-" Well, Jefferson you was right-elder Sniffles&#xD;
is a very interesting preacher-very, indeed. I never&#xD;
was more edified in my life than I 'ye been this morn-&#xD;
in'. He ain't so bad looJciri7, another, as I was thinki~nZ&#xD;
he was,: that er~ wig makes him look ten year young-&#xD;

a wig-it 's so natural. And them specs, too: they 're&#xD;
an improvement on account o' kind o' bidin' the pe-&#xD;
cooliarities of his eyes. I don't know as I should a'&#xD;

~armon 1-Oh, Jefferson, that was what I call a sar-&#xD;
mow in earnest! I begin to think 't ain't right to be so&#xD;
prejudiced against other denominations. I should&#xD;
like to~ be introduced to Elder Sniffles, and hear him&#xD;
converse." Wouldn't it be rich, Nancy, to be an ii&#xD;
visible listener to the conversation? The next day II&#xD;

I 'ye had had an undescribeible desire ~o hey some&#xD;
privit conversation with you, in regard to the state o'&#xD;
my mind-your discourse was so wonderful searchin'&#xD;
that I felt to mourn over my backslidden state o'&#xD;
stewpidity, and my consarn has increased every time&#xD;
I 'ye sot under the dropping's o' your sancVuery. Last&#xD;

it 's ~ terrible thing to be alone in the world? I know&#xD;
&#xD;
all about it by experience, for I 'ye ben parduerless&#xD;

't was better to be alone than. to run enny resk-for&#xD;

According' to my notions, riches and grander ain't to&#xD;
be compared to religion, no how you can fix it, and&#xD;
I always told 'em so. But I was a tellin' how over-&#xD;

transmitted by your nephew. Permit me, also, to&#xD;
assure you of my abundant gratification at the assur-&#xD;
ance that my unpretending discourses haA~en the&#xD;
feeble instrument of exerting a salutary influence upon&#xD;
your mind. I feel, most deeply do I feel, that I am&#xD;
but a poor unworthy worm of the dust; and it serves&#xD;
but to augment my humiliation to reflect that my&#xD;
labors in the field have been so signally blessed. Your&#xD;
remedies, most excellent madam, I have applied in&#xD;
accordance with your directions; and it affords me&#xD;
no inconsiderable satisfaction to be able to say that I&#xD;
think I can safely affirm that their effects~upon my&#xD;
system have been salubrious; and I can but indulge&#xD;
the hope that they will tend to my ultimate restore~&#xD;
tion. I must not, however, omit to mention, that I did&#xD;
no~ realize, to the full extent, the efficacy of the hop-&#xD;
ba~; for after having arisen agreeably to your direc-&#xD;
tions, some five or six times~{it may 4 seven, i will&#xD;
not venture to speak positively as to the number) and&#xD;
immersed the hop-bag in the b6i~ing vinegar, I re-&#xD;
gret to say that I unintentiona1ly~ell into a state of&#xD;
unconsciousness, from which I unhappily did not&#xD;
awake until morning. Owing to this tixifortunate oc-&#xD;

bag would have afforded. However, notwithstand.&#xD;
ing this unintentional neglect, I am. happy to state&#xD;
that the virulence of my attack is decidedly abated.&#xD;
I acknowledge myself deeply indebted for the poem&#xD;
which accompanied your communication. It was&#xD;
truly gratifying to my feelings. Your remark therein&#xD;
embodied, that "we tarry in a world of trial," is a&#xD;
very just one-very, indeed. This is incontrovertibly&#xD;
a life of trials-of disappointments and fluctuations,&#xD;
sent, undoubtedly, for~ the fortification of our faith.&#xD;
It will afford me most unmitigated pleasure to ~on&#xD;
vese with you privately, in regard to your mind, and&#xD;
to give you such instructions upon doctrinal points&#xD;
as may be necessary and conducive to your spiritual&#xD;
edification. With that view, I invite you to call at&#xD;
my residence~ on Friday evening next, when, if no&#xD;
unforeseen contingencies intervene to prevent, and my&#xD;
corporeal condition continues to improve, I shall be&#xD;
unoccupied and most happy~to attend to your case,&#xD;

I 'd a s'po.s~d you ever meandered here. I never was&#xD;
here afore-but I was a setting' by my winder and I&#xD;
cast my eyes over here, and as I observed the lofty&#xD;
trees a wavin' in the gentle blast, and heerd the feath-&#xD;
ered singsters a wobblin' their mellancolly music, I&#xD;
f~lt quite a call to come over, it 's so retired and mo-&#xD;

"I assure you, Mrs:Bedott, it was unintentional on&#xD;
my part, entirely unintentional, but my contiguity to&#xD;
yourself, and your proximity to ~e, were such as ren-&#xD;
dered it impossible for me to avoid hearing you-"&#xD;
"Well, it can't be helped now, it 's no use cryin' for&#xD;

"On the contrary, this grove is a favorite resort of&#xD;

On your entrance, I was occupying my customary seat&#xD;

When I fust heern you preach, your sermons onset-&#xD;

not to trade a cent's woth with him. You remember&#xD;
how he come it over me about the shoes, don't ye?&#xD;
Well it 's amazin" I should. ever be such a fool as to&#xD;
be took in by him agin---but so 't was. He come&#xD;
along here a spell ago, and served me the awfuilest&#xD;
trick that ever you heerd on. I was alone in the house&#xD;
~yer aunt had went to a sick nabor's, and the way he&#xD;
cheated n~ was perfectly dretful. My blud biles now&#xD;
a thinking' on 't. He pretended he 'd experienced re-&#xD;
ligion, and latijented over the way he used to cheat&#xD;
and lie; and as true as I live and breathe, actilly got&#xD;
roun~l me so 't he preswaded me to swop away an ele-&#xD;
gant stun colored silk, that cost me a dollar a yard,&#xD;
for a miserable slazy striped consarn, that he said was&#xD;
all the fashion now-called it "grody flewry"-and&#xD;
what makes it more aggravating' made me pay tew dol-&#xD;
lars to boot. . But that wasn't the wost on 't, for come&#xD;
to enroll it, we found that three or four yards. away&#xD;
at t' other eend on 't was all dammidged and stained&#xD;
up-~.'t wasn't fit for nothing. Yer aunt was mad at&#xD;
me for bein' so toQk in, and yer uncle he laift and&#xD;
hectored me and went on about it-you know what a&#xD;
critter he is to bother a boddy. At last I busted out&#xD;
*   a cryin,' and went off and shot myself up in my room,&#xD;
and stayed there till tea time-and when I come down,&#xD;
lo and behold,, yer uncle stept up and handed me a&#xD;
new green merino dress~~-4ie 'd ben off to the store&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
186&#xD;
&#xD;

and bought it a purpose for me, frii ge, and buttons&#xD;
and. every thing to trim it with, aiA I've got it made&#xD;
up, and. it sets like a dandy-and I 'in gwine to be&#xD;
married in it. J3ut I can't help feeling' awfully gat~led'&#xD;
about the silk. I took it to Parker ~nd Pettibone's and&#xD;
swoppt it for some things I wanted. They w6uldent&#xD;
allow me but eighteen pence a yard, and 't was all&#xD;
't was woth. Jabe made me take a couple o' hanker-&#xD;
chers tew, for a dollar a piece-said he 'd stake his&#xD;
repertation on 't they wasn't half cotton-and no more&#xD;
they wasn't, for come to dew 'em up, they showed out&#xD;
plain enuff that they was all cotton-did you. ever?&#xD;
He got round the 'elder tew-made him pay five dol-&#xD;
lars for a buzzum pin-said 't was topiz sot in gold;&#xD;
and it turned out to be yeller glass with a pinchback&#xD;
rim round it. I was clear out o' pashence with the&#xD;
elder for bein' so green-but sittiwated as I was&#xD;
couldn't say nothing' ye know. If ever I come across&#xD;
Jabe Clark agin, if he don't ketch it, no matter. But&#xD;
I 'm wonderful bizzy about these days-and so no&#xD;

forgot, for I 'ye got such a numerous number o' things&#xD;
to think on now. My future companion is the&#xD;
Baptist minister o' this place-biy the name o' Bider&#xD;
Sniffles. The way we come acquainted was quite&#xD;
singular. You see I took to attendin' his meetin'&#xD;

potaters that 't wa'n't eddifyin' for me to set under his -&#xD;
preachin', and understandin' that Elder Sniffles was a&#xD;
very gifted man I thought I 'd, go to hear him.&#xD;
Well, I liked him wonderful well, ie 's a powerful&#xD;
speaker and his prayers is highly interestin'. So I&#xD;
goes to hear him a number o' times. He obsarved&#xD;
me and was evidently pleased with me-but during&#xD;
all the time I was creatin' such a sensation in his&#xD;

JEFT Scrabble Hill this morning' in the stage for&#xD;

be unpleasant for r~ie to stay to hurr while the par*&#xD;
sonage was undergwine ~epafrs; and, besides the&#xD;

conformity arid went. 'T was determined I should&#xD;
visit the (Jrippinses, at Libertyville-Mrs. Orippin 1~ein'&#xD;
my husband's cousin.&#xD;
The morning was derlicious, and Aurory shone with&#xD;
undiminished lustu~re~ The feathered s~ngsters wob.&#xD;
bled in the groves; the breezes was ladened with the&#xD;
fi~agrance of ten thousand flowers, while natur seemed&#xD;
to vie with creation to render the scene one of unmit~&#xD;
gated splendor. But I scercely noticed it a bit; for I&#xD;
wasn't in a sittiWation to enjoy it a mite. Alas! my&#xD;

THE REV. MRS. SNIFI'LES ADRc'AD. 1~S&#xD;
diwiddiwal that lent me his hat brought him very for~.&#xD;
cibly to my mind. He was drest in black, and had &amp;amp;&#xD;
wonderful dignified and thoughtful cast of expression.&#xD;
I made up my mind he was a clergyman as soon as I&#xD;
sot eyed Qn him; so when I handed back 'his hat I&#xD;
ventured to inquire where his field o' labor was. He&#xD;
hem'd' and haw'd, and seemed rather i~nbarrised. So I&#xD;
says, says I, "I s'pose I ain't mistaken in takin' you&#xD;
for a clergyman ?"&#xD;
But afore he had time to answer, t' other on&amp;amp;-he&#xD;
was quite a young man-spoke up; and~ says he,&#xD;
"You 're iight, marm-it 's the Reverend Mr. Beadle,&#xD;
of Funkin Hook."&#xD;
"And this is my principal deacon, Mr. Snobs,"&#xD;
says Mr. Beadle.&#xD;
So I told. 'em who I was; and after the ice was&#xD;
broke, we had considerabk interesting' conversation on&#xD;
a number o' tropics, espesiiealy on the state o' religion&#xD;
in this section, particularly in our respectable places&#xD;
of abode. They seemed wonderful grieved at ihe in.&#xD;
ikity that prevails in our midst. Infbrmed me tha1~&#xD;
they 'd jest ben attending' a convention to 8uppreSS th8&#xD;
railroads rnnnin' a Sabberdays. They never fravePd&#xD;
on 't, cause it didn't lay by a Sabberdays.&#xD;
They seemed. to be very much interested in ~e. I&#xD;
showed 'eni the poetry I 'd ben writing' which they w~&#xD;
wonderfully struck with. Brother Beadle proposed&#xD;
settin' on 't to music, and all on us singing' it together.&#xD;

The deacon thought 't would go in "Away with mel.&#xD;
lancolly :" but not bein' conversant with that tune, I&#xD;
proposed "Haddam "-a great Th~vorite 0' mine. They&#xD;
said they 'd amost forgot Haddam; so I sung one stan~&#xD;
zy to show 'em how it went, and then we all put to&#xD;
and sung it together. They didn't make out very&#xD;
well I didn't think; didn't keep no time; seemed to&#xD;
be what Jeff Magwire calls indepeide~zt srnger8, that is,&#xD;
each one went entirely on his own hook, without pay-&#xD;
in' no attention to the rest. But no doubt they done&#xD;
the best they could, and I hadent ought to find fault.&#xD;
The deacon requested me to give him the poim, in&#xD;
order to have it printed in the " Punkin Hook Patriot&#xD;
and Journal." After some hesitation I consented.&#xD;
At Pukin Hook my interesting' feller travelers got&#xD;
out. I regretted martin', and so did they. I invited&#xD;
Brother Beadle to come to Scrable Hill and preach&#xD;
for us sometime. He squeezed my hand, and said he&#xD;
was delighted to have met with such a sister in Israel&#xD;
'-he never should forget the refreshing' season he 'd&#xD;
er~joyed inmy society.&#xD;
The rest o' the way to Iiibertyville I was the only&#xD;
passenger; but 't wa'n't no great distance. Jest as the&#xD;
horizon was srnkin' behind the western skies, I arniv&#xD;
at Cousin Cnippinses. When I told 'em who I was&#xD;
they received me with open arms, for they set a great&#xD;
de~I by the elder. They 're elderly people, very well&#xD;
o~; haln't no famii~y but a son. and daughter, both&#xD;

married and settled. The daughter lives in the same&#xD;
place, is married to a risin'. doctor by the name&#xD;
Briggs. In short, I think I should be quite contented&#xD;
here if my beloved, companion was only with me.&#xD;
But the accumulation' shadders o' night, aggravated, by&#xD;
the descending' of my candle into the socket, warns me&#xD;

I niz at an arly hour, and sallied forth into Cousin&#xD;
Orippinses guarding to view the works of natur. 0&#xD;
how it expends and illuminates t~e religious affections&#xD;
to contemplate the wonders of creation. The pines&#xD;
was all in full blow, and the yallar lilies riz up strait&#xD;
and stiff to court the revigoratin' atmosphere. Also&#xD;
the cabbidge leaves was a glittering' with dew drops,&#xD;
and looked like ever so many fans kivered with span*&#xD;
gles. My hull soul was evaporation' with delightful:&#xD;
meditation, when cousin Orippin blowd the horn for&#xD;
breakfast, and I was obleeged to go in, though I 'd ten&#xD;
times rather a stayed there ~than to eat. Cousin Onip&#xD;

wonder whether she sponges 'em over night: don't be.&#xD;

spungin' 'em, according' to my way o' thinking .&#xD;
This afternoon Cousin Crippinses daughter, Mrs.&#xD;
Briggs, she 't was Susan Ann Crippin,~ called on me;&#xD;
rather an ornery looking woman, but quite genteel&#xD;
and intellectible. The ~Crippinses had told me so&#xD;
much about her that I was prepared to be wonder-&#xD;
fully struck up with her. She writes poetry for the&#xD;
"Liber~yville Reflector." She invited me to attend a'&#xD;
literary swearee at her sittiwation to-morrer evening .&#xD;
She says they hold their sw~arees once a fortnight, and&#xD;
she thinks they have a great attendance to elevate the&#xD;
tone o' society, and axed if we had anysuc~ thing at&#xD;
Scrabble Hill. I told her no, that they was pretty&#xD;
high strung ther already, and didn't need nothing' to&#xD;
elevate their tone. She smiled at this observation,&#xD;
and remarked that I was rather sarcastical.&#xD;
She said they didn't admit none to membership&#xD;
without they 'd had something printed; but others&#xD;
was sometimes invited to attend and enjoy the benefit&#xD;
of the intellectible feast. And they 'd be happy to&#xD;
see me. I 'd have the pleaser~ o' meeting' a number of&#xD;
literary characters; among 'em "Nell Nox," the cele-&#xD;
'brated critic, and "Kate Kenype," the well..known&#xD;
and greatly admired advocate of women. She pre-&#xD;
sumed I'd heerd of 'em both. "Nell Nox" was very&#xD;
severe, very sarcastical, very, indeed. I told her I 'd&#xD;

a number o' poims printed myself. She lookt quite&#xD;
surprised, and I confess I was surprisder yet that she&#xD;
hadent seen or heerd. o' my pieces in the "Scrabble&#xD;
Hill Luminary." On the hull, I was rather disap-&#xD;

FRIDAY.-Last night attended the literary swearee&#xD;
at Cousin Briggses, and was highly entertained. Ther&#xD;
was ten or a dozen present, and four on 'em had. crig-&#xD;
inal productions. The most extinguished article was&#xD;
the Widder Reade's. She signs her productions&#xD;
"Nell Nox5." She 's a very fleshy woman, with a&#xD;
wonderful small head. I took particular notice of&#xD;
~her 'cause she 's so notorious in a literary point o'&#xD;
view. She had, a singular looking' head-dress stuck~atop&#xD;
of her head. Her nose is awful long, and turns up&#xD;
at the ~eend; very handy, - saves her the trouble o'&#xD;
turning' on 't it up every time she reads a poor piece o'&#xD;
* poetry, and she don't seem to read no other exception'&#xD;
Cousin Briggses. She was drest in a sky blue muslin&#xD;
dress with flounces almost up to her waist, that made&#xD;
her look shorter and fleshyer than she actilly was.&#xD;
She had a dretful severe critisisni on the American&#xD;

poits, espeshially a certain long-feller, as she called him,&#xD;
some tall ifrdiwidiwal I s'pose. She cut him all to&#xD;
pieces, declaring that he had never writ a line that&#xD;
could be call poetry in all his born days She said&#xD;
that his Eve Angeline was a perfectly nonsensical&#xD;
humbug, I presume that 's some young woman he 's&#xD;
engaged to. I thought if she was a mind to whale&#xD;
away against the long-feller she might, but she might a let&#xD;
his intended alQne. Cousin Susan Ann axed me after-&#xD;
wards if I dident think Nell Nox was awful cutting .&#xD;
She said 6he shouldent like to come under her lash.&#xD;
She wondered what long-feller 'd say ~J~en he come to&#xD;
see that criticism, as he undoubtedly would, for&#xD;
't would come out in "The Reflector" afore long; Nell&#xD;
contribbits t6 that paper. Thinkeme I ain't feared of&#xD;
her; I guess she 'II change her sentiments when she&#xD;
hears my piece. She '11 think ther is such a thing as&#xD;
poetry in Ameriky then. For I had in my pocket the&#xD;
stanzys I writ in the stage-I 'd brought 'em along,&#xD;
- thinking' like enough I should be called on to read&#xD;
somdhing.&#xD;
The editor of "The Reflector" was there; he 's presi-&#xD;
dent of the swearees. A wonderful small, jandery-&#xD;
lookin' young man, with blazinV red hair, and exceed-&#xD;
inly pompous, but uncommon talented. He had an&#xD;
article on the prospects of the literary horizon through-&#xD;
out the world. His sentiments differed from Nell&#xD;
Noxes inasmuch as he held that Ameriky was the&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE REV. MRS. SNIFFLES ABROAD. 199&#xD;
only country where poetry had reached the hight of&#xD;
its zenith. To prove it, he brought forward Cousin&#xD;
Briggses writing, said that even Nell Nox, the severest&#xD;
critic of the age, spared her; ther wasn't nothing in&#xD;
her poetry that no critic could git hold of. He-wound&#xD;
up, at last, by glorifyin', in a most eloquent manner,&#xD;
that both o' these remarkable writers were contribbit-&#xD;
ors to his paper.&#xD;
Next come Cousin Su~an Ann Briggs with her article.&#xD;
'T was a very affection' poim on, the death o' Deacon&#xD;
Paine's daughter. I don't remember but one stanzy,&#xD;
and that come' in at the eend of every alternative&#xD;
verse. It runs thus:&#xD;
Fond parents weep for me no more,&#xD;
That I no more am given;&#xD;
we'll surely ~h~ll meet when life is ore,&#xD;
High up above in heaven.&#xD;
I must ax Cousin Briggs for a coppy on 't, it 's very&#xD;
good, though I actily think I can beat it; 't ain't for&#xD;
me to say so, -however. Her newspaper name is&#xD;
"Fenella Fitzallen."&#xD;
The last indiwidiwal that~read was an elderly young&#xD;
woman, named Samanthy Hocum, a wonderful tall,&#xD;
slab-sided, coarse looking' critter. Her hair looked&#xD;
singular, 't was all raked back off her forward, and&#xD;
made her ~phizrnahogany look amazing' broad and&#xD;
brazen. She certainly wasioncommon odd. and ornary&#xD;
looking . Had on a red calico dress, and a queer kind&#xD;

of a bobtailed little thing, made o' gr~en silk, with&#xD;
brass buttons down it. Take her altogether, she was&#xD;
about as singular a critter in her appearance as I've&#xD;
seen in some time. But she 's uncommon smart. She&#xD;
had an article on the subject o' "WoA~a~'s Rights."&#xD;
'T was a powerful production. She h~at the men&#xD;
hadent no bizuess to monopolize every thing, and&#xD;
tramxnil the female sect. I thought to myself they&#xD;
hadent showed no great disposition to trammil her so&#xD;
far. She writes for the "Pidgin Pint Record of&#xD;
Genius," and signs Kate Kenype.&#xD;
Them was all the articles that was read last night,&#xD;
though ther was several more literary indiwidiwals&#xD;
ther. A fat, pudden-faced young man that writes&#xD;
poetry for the "Newville 'Star and Trumpet," and&#xD;
signs "Phil Philpotts." And then ther was a rather&#xD;
good looking' young woman that writes the amusing'&#xD;
articles for i~he same paper, and signs 'em "Betsy But.&#xD;
tertub," and some more,' but I disremember their news~&#xD;
paper names.&#xD;
After the reading' was over, the company diverted&#xD;
the time till the refreshments come in to walking' round&#xD;
and round through the folding' doors to the hail, and&#xD;
then from the hall, through the folding' doors agin, as&#xD;
if ther lives depended on 'to The editor,'~ he Walked&#xD;
with Nell Nox, and hil Philpotts with Betsy But.&#xD;
tertub, and Kate Kenyp , she stramanaded round alone,&#xD;
wonderful independent. I sot on the sofy and talked&#xD;
&#xD;
TUE REV. MRS. SNIFFLES ABROAD. 201&#xD;
to the Briggses till I got as dizzy as a fool, em&#xD;
go round and round. IL wanted to read my poim, and&#xD;
I seed plainly that Cousin Susan Ann didn't mean to&#xD;
ax me to (shouldent wonder if she was a little jealous).&#xD;
So I determined I would read it wheflaer or no; so&#xD;
when the company sot down to take refreshment, I&#xD;
speaks up and says, that seem' I 'd ben so eddifie4&#xD;
myself; I thought I 'd ought to contribute my share to&#xD;
the evening's entertainment; and then without furder&#xD;
ado, I takes out my piece and reads it. 'T was very&#xD;
much admired. Nell Nox declared 't was what size&#xD;
called poetry, and the editor requested a coppy on 't to&#xD;
put in "The Reflector." I gi'n it tew him. It didn't&#xD;
strike me till after IL got hum thai I 'd gi'n it the&#xD;
Reverend Mr. Beadle, to be printed in the "Punkin&#xD;
Hook Patriot and Journal." So I s'pose the tew&#xD;
paPers 'II be accusing' one another o' stealing' on 't, and&#xD;
there 'II be a regular newspaper quarrel abo~tt it ~ and&#xD;
I shall be drawn into public notice in a manner very&#xD;
imbarrassin' to my retirin' disposition. But I can't&#xD;
help it. We literary characters must expect to be&#xD;
subjected to a great many more unpleasant things than&#xD;
falls to the lot o~ privit indiwidiwals-it 's the fate o'&#xD;

Don't know but what I 'd try git up a Literary&#xD;

and the elder. lie talked up anci made considerable&#xD;
a sensation. It told him forehand to do his pur-&#xD;
tiest, for I wanted old Dawson's wife to ~ee 't I 'd got&#xD;
a pardner rather above a common plow-jogger, such&#xD;
as hem is. And I guess she felt it some, for she&#xD;
looked mighty spiteful. While the elder was a taJkin',&#xD;
she kept a hunchin Miss Coon, -and grinning . Sam&#xD;
Pendergrasses wife said she observed to her that she&#xD;
should think I 'ci be in a constant state o' consarn&#xD;
about the elder, for fear he'd git choked with a big&#xD;
word sticking' in his throat. Miss Pendergrass said&#xD;
"she wouldn't care a cent about it, if she was me; for&#xD;
't was plain enough 't wasn't nothing' but envy because&#xD;
her husband could n't talk so."&#xD;
"But you was gwine to tell about them dagger-&#xD;

"0 yes. Well, Sam ?endergrasses wife axed Miss&#xD;
Coon to play on the planner. They 'ye got a planner&#xD;

things! IL wish you could a ben there! If 't wasn't&#xD;
Idiin', then no matter. She throw 'd back her head,&#xD;
and she rolled up her eyes, and she thrum 'd it off&#xD;
with the tips o' her lingers. But good gracious! her&#xD;
singing ! you 'd a gin up, IL know, if you 'd a heerd it!&#xD;
The way she squawked it out was a caution to old&#xD;
gates on a windy day! See, what was it she sung?&#xD;
0,1 remember-a dretftil nonsensical tlaing, that kept&#xD;
a sayin' every little while 'J&amp;amp;nmeni fondly thine&#xD;
own.' IL was perfectly disgusted."&#xD;
"But what Lias all that to dew with the dagger-&#xD;
types ?"&#xD;
"WeU, IL was a gwine to tell-why can't ye have&#xD;
patience? IL was setting' right by the planner when&#xD;
she sung, and IL observed that she had on a wonderful&#xD;
curus buzzom-pin. So, after she 'd got done her&#xD;
music, and gone back t' other side o' the room, IL says&#xD;
to Melissy, says IL, what a sing'lar looking' buzzum-pin&#xD;
Miss Coon 's got on-wonder what it 's made of!&#xD;
'Why, mar,'~ says she, 'it 's a daggertype o' the Major&#xD;
-didn't you never see a daggertype?" 'No,' says IL,&#xD;
'but IL' 'ye heerd o' 'em.' So Melissy she got right up,&#xD;
and went and axed Miss Coon if she would n't be&#xD;
kind enough to let mar see her pin. IL was awful mad&#xD;
at Melissy-~did n't want that stuck up, critter to know 't&#xD;
I noticed I~er pin-so I speaks up, and IL says, 'IL want&#xD;
ye to under~tap4, Miss Coon, that I didn't request&#xD;

say~ 8he, 'you 're perfectly welcome to see it.' So she&#xD;
onfastened it, and handed it to Melissy, mighty graci-&#xD;
ous. She 's always wonderful polite to Melissy-don't&#xD;
know, IL 'm sure, wh~t 's the reason she treats her so&#xD;
much better 'n ever she did me; but IL s'pose ther&#xD;
ain't nothing' about her t~ be jealous of. Well, Melissy&#xD;
she fetched it over, an~ IL could n't help looking' at it;&#xD;
and sure enough, there was the major, natural as life,&#xD;
with all his train' regimentals on-'t was complete.&#xD;
Miss Coon axed me how IL liked, it. 'T ain't wonderful&#xD;
handsome ' says IL, 'but it'~ looks fQll as well as the&#xD;
major.' Miss Coon turned rather red, and 't was plain&#xD;
to be seen she felt cut up. Melissy-silly thing-she&#xD;
kind o' wanted to plaster over what IL 'd said, so she&#xD;
praised it up to the skies-said she never see any&#xD;
thing so peffect-~-and axed Miss Coon where 't was&#xD;
took. Miss Coon said the major had it took in&#xD;
Gambletown a few days afore. Ther was a gentleman&#xD;
stayin' there a few weeks, that done 'em uncommon&#xD;
correct. '0, mar,' says Melissy, 'IL heerd the elder&#xD;
say he meant to go home by the way o' Gambletown&#xD;
.-why can't you stop and have yourn and the elder's&#xD;
took for me? Jubiter 's got a cousin livin' there-a&#xD;
young man named Jo Baker, and he 's a comm' out&#xD;
here in a fqw weeks. You can leave 'em with him to&#xD;
fetch.' 'Well,' says IL, 'IL '11 see about it.' After that,&#xD;
Melissy she teamed us till we promise to git 'em for&#xD;
her. She concluded she 'd like to have us represented&#xD;

together in one picter. We 'd made our calculations&#xD;
to stop in Ganabletown a day or tew on our way hum.&#xD;
The elder was some acquainted with Elder Gunastork,&#xD;
the minister there-had met him at the meeting' o'the&#xD;
Baptist Presbytery. We left Wiggletown a Monday,&#xD;
went round by Pidgin Pint, and stopped there to~&#xD;
ward night. The elder inquired where the Baptist&#xD;
mitaister lived, and we went there. We had n't never&#xD;
heerd o' him afore~-but 't was better to go there than&#xD;
to have a tavern bill to pay. His name was Elder&#xD;
Hawley. The' elder he introduced himself as the&#xD;
Rev. Elder Sniffles, from Scrabble Hill, and his con-&#xD;
sort. Well, brother hawley invited us in and intro-&#xD;
duced us to his wife. She was a sick looking' woman,&#xD;
with a hull raft o' young ones squallin' round her.&#xD;
'T wasn't very pleasant there, they did n't seem to be in&#xD;
Wonderful good circumstances. But they treated us&#xD;
very polite, and we staid till Thursday, for Brother&#xD;
Hawley was a holding' a protracted meeting , and invited&#xD;
the elder to stay awhile and assist. A Thursday we&#xD;
come on to Gambletown, got there in theafternoon.&#xD;
Elder Oumstork as very glad to see us, and so was&#xD;
his wife. I was q4ite surprised when I seen her, for&#xD;
I used to know 4aer some. Her name was Mary&#xD;
f          Cushman. She used to keep school in Wiggletown&#xD;
when Melissy was a little- gal. I sent her to Miss&#xD;
(Jushnaan's school. Melissy liked her very well, but&#xD;
I never thought much o' her. She was kind o' proud&#xD;
&#xD;
THE REV. MRS. SNIFFLES AT HOME. 211&#xD;
.-could n't git acquainted with her. ~he would n't&#xD;
talk about nobody. She had quite a quarrel with&#xD;
the Widder Jinikins about Alviry. Miss Jinkins took&#xD;
Alviry out o' school. There was a great deal said&#xD;
about it. Every body was a takin' sues. Miss Jinkius&#xD;
went all around blazin' away against Miss Gushman.&#xD;
But I could n't hear o' Miss Cushman's saying any&#xD;
thing, though I s'pose Miss Jinkins did abuse her&#xD;
shamefully. Well, I invited her to drink tea at our&#xD;
house a purpose to see if she wouldn't have some~&#xD;
thing to say about it, but she never opened her head.&#xD;
I tried my best to draw her out-expressed my opin-&#xD;
ion o' the Widder Jinkins without reserve. But still&#xD;
the provoking' critter never said a syllable about the&#xD;
matter. I tell you 't was the last time I axed her there&#xD;
'to tea. I was disgusted with her. I took cp4te a dis-&#xD;
like tew her, and when she went away I did n't care&#xD;
whether I ever heerd from her agin or not. And I&#xD;
had n't heerd since-did n't know what had become o'&#xD;
her. But I know'd her the minute I clapped my&#xD;
eyes on her in Gambletown, for she 's rather a singu-&#xD;
lar looking' woman. 'Law me,' says I, 'Mary Gush.&#xD;
man, I want to know if that 's you?' 'Jest so,' says&#xD;
she, but I can't for the life o' me tell who you are.'&#xD;
'The dear me,' say I,' why I ~m the Reverend Miss&#xD;
Sniffles, she 't was Widder Bedott, o' Wiggletown.'&#xD;
'Sure enough,' says she, I wonder I did n't know you,&#xD;
but I 'ye seen so many folks since I was there, it&#xD;

rather confuses me sometimes.' I thought 't was a&#xD;
pretty poor excuse for fogettin' me, but I passed it off.&#xD;
She was wonderful polite to us. They 'd ben to&#xD;
dinner, but she went and got dinner for us right off.&#xD;
She don't keep no help, does all her own work, and I&#xD;
must say she keeps the house in very nice order, and&#xD;
cooks pretty well considering' she used to be a school-&#xD;
marm; school teachers dun't generally make no great&#xD;
o' housekeeper's. Her husband seemed to be Wonder-&#xD;
Liii proud o' her; told how well she got along, and&#xD;
what a good manager she was, and all that. But I;&#xD;
thought I 'd let 'em know 't I had n't no great opinion&#xD;
o' her housekeeping . She sot on a leg o' biled mutton&#xD;
for us, and some vegetables and bread and butter.&#xD;
So when we sot down to the table I declined takin'&#xD;
any o' the meat. Miss Oumstork axed me if I wasn't&#xD;
hungry. 'Yes,' says I,' but I don't like biled vitals,&#xD;
ain't used to 'em.' ,S~~t~elt awful bad, and went and&#xD;
fetcht on some cokV roast beef But Ii told her she&#xD;
need n't a troubled herself; for I could n't eat cold&#xD;
meat. So she said she 'd cut off some slices and heat&#xD;
1&#xD;
em in a stew-pan. I begged 0' her not to dew it, for in&#xD;
my opinion warmed up vittals wasn't fit to eat. 'I 'II&#xD;
make out with a potater,'~says I, 'and a piece o' bread.'&#xD;
At last she gin up tryin' to make me take any thin'&#xD;
else. But the elder he eat wonderful hearty. I kept&#xD;
a winkin' at him to hold up, but he would n't take&#xD;
the hint. Afterward she brought on a rice pudding ,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE REV. MRS. Si~IWFLE5 AT HOME. 218&#xD;
and the elder let into 't in earnest. I eat some tew, for,&#xD;
to tell the truth, I was awful hungry, but did n't&#xD;
want 'em to think I eat it because 't was good, so, I&#xD;
says, says I,' rice pudding' 's terrible plain; but it 's&#xD;
better 'n nothing , and Ii s'pose Ii shall be sick if I don't&#xD;
eat something. ' When we was alone the elder un.&#xD;
dertook to take me to do about findin' fault with the&#xD;
vittals, but I told him he need n't be consarned, for I&#xD;
meant to let the Oumstorks see 't I know'd what was&#xD;
what, though I had n't been a schooV~marm. And I&#xD;
made it a pint to turn up my nose at every thing in&#xD;
the house all the time I was there; and I tell ye, I&#xD;
could n't help laughing' in my sleeve to see how&#xD;
comfortable it made 'em feel. Well, we stayed till&#xD;
the next Monday, and the elder he preached for*&#xD;
brother Oumstork. The Gambletown folks was very&#xD;
much taken with him, and with me tew, all the most&#xD;
extinguished indiwiddiwals in the place called on me.&#xD;
I see that they seemed to think Miss Cumstork was an&#xD;
amazing' smart, intellectible woman, but whenever I got&#xD;
a chance I let 'em~now 't Idid n't think so, nor the Wig.&#xD;
gletown folks did n't think so another. I rather guess the&#xD;
Oumstorks 'II have to draw in their horns after this-"&#xD;

* his name-had a great flarin' sign stuck up over his&#xD;
door that had on 't, 'Mr. Augustus Montgomery,&#xD;
Daggertyper.' Well, we went in there a Friday to&#xD;
look at his pictures, and see what he taxed for takin'&#xD;
'em---thought mabby he 'd strike off some on account&#xD;
of our belonging' to the clergy. Brother Oumstork&#xD;
,went with us and introduced us; and Mr. Montgom-&#xD;
ery was wonderful polite-showed all his picters; told&#xD;
us all about 'em tew.-.the way he took'em and so on;&#xD;
though most on 'em was his own likenesses. There&#xD;
was Mr. Montgomery a readin'-Mr. Montgomery a&#xD;
smokin'-~-.Mr. Montgomery a shavin'-and ever so&#xD;
many more. I forgit what they was all a dewin'.&#xD;
All the time I kept a thinking' I 'd seen the man afore;&#xD;
but to save my life I couldn't remember when nor&#xD;
where. He looked kind o' natural some how, and his&#xD;
voice sounded jest as if I 'd heerd it afore. But then&#xD;
he lookt so different, no wonder I dilent know him at&#xD;
first. He 'd cut off his whiskers all, only a bunch on&#xD;
the tip of his chin; and he 'd got on spectacles&#xD;
I noticed he looked over the tops of 'em. He had a&#xD;
wig, tew, considerable blacker 'n his own hair. The&#xD;
~lder and me we stood up together and ~axed him if&#xD;
he thought we 'd take well. He looked at us a nun'&#xD;
ute, and then says he, 'Jingo! you 'd make an admy-&#xD;
rable picter.' Then it popped right into my head&#xD;
who 't was. I was on the pint o' screamin' right out&#xD;
-but I happened to think and hild my tongue, for&#xD;
&#xD;
THE REV. MRS. S2~IFFL~ES AT HOME. ~17&#xD;
thinks me, I'll come up with ye old feller for that&#xD;
'grody flewry'. ~fore I quit ye. So I told him we&#xD;
set for our picters; and he fixed the plate and the ma-&#xD;
chine, and arranged us in our cheers the way we&#xD;
wanted to be represented-and then he took us. But&#xD;
the first one wasn't good. The Elder he hosted his&#xD;
eyebrows-it 's a trick o' hisen-and so his picture had&#xD;
as much as a dosen pair of eyes. 'T was rather big.&#xD;
ger 'n I wanted it tew. I axed him if he couldn't&#xD;
make one ru.ther smaller. He said, '0 yes, he had a&#xD;
process by which he could manage 'em down to any&#xD;
size.' So we sot agin, a little fiirder off from the ma-&#xD;

first; and I liked it so well, I concluded to have an-&#xD;
other one to fetch home with me. The elder opened&#xD;
his eyes and looked surpriseder 'n ever; but I gin hi~i~&#xD;

Well,' says he, 'my regular price for a double pieter&#xD;

it, IL happened to have that ar buzzom-pin he~ sold me&#xD;
elder in my work-pocket. It had ben th~re ever&#xD;
since the Elder first showed it to me, So IL takes it&#xD;
out and holds it up afore him. 'T was as green as&#xD;
grass, and any body could see in a minit that 't was&#xD;
brass. 'There,' says I, 'that 's a buzzum-pin that my&#xD;
husband bought of a pedlar and paid him five dollars&#xD;
for it. He was a wonderful pious pedlar-had jest ex-&#xD;
perienced religion-and of course he wouldn't take&#xD;
the advantage of a minister o' the Gospel; and lie&#xD;
said 't was woth double the money he taxed; but&#xD;
seem' he was trading' with the clargy, he wouldn't&#xD;
charge but half-price. To be sure, it client look so&#xD;
green then as it does now-the greenness was princi-&#xD;
pally on husband's side. Now I 'm willing' to dew as&#xD;
well by you as Jabe Clark done by my husband. I '11&#xD;
let ye have this pin to pay for the picters, and won't&#xD;
ax no boot.' Then I gin him a known' look.&#xD;
I wish you could a seen the critter. I tell ye 't was&#xD;
n.h1 as Jeff says. He turned pale, and then he&#xD;
turned red, ~and looked as if he was completely&#xD;
stumped. The elder he begun to ham and haw as if&#xD;
he was a gwine to say something. ~ut I looke~ at&#xD;
him in a way thal made him think 't wasn't ~r,6th&#xD;
while. Elder Cumstork tew looked perfectly as&#xD;
tonished. He examined the pin, and says he, "Why&#xD;
Sister Sniffles, this ere 's' brass and no mistake~--that&#xD;
~dlar cheated brother Sniffles most wickedly."&#xD;

THE REV. MRS. BNIFF~LESATHOME. 21~&#xD;
"What 1" says I, "you don't 8'pose that a pedlar&#xD;
that had experienced religion at a protracted. meeting ,&#xD;
and sold splendid 'grody flewry' silk for only a dol'&#xD;
lar a yard, and linen cambric handkerchers that wci~'n't&#xD;
half cotton, for half price, would put off a brass buz&#xD;

Brother CulnstQrk didn't say no more. Well, Mi'.&#xD;

o' the offer ?" "Well, well," says he, "raly, 1-I-"&#xD;
Then II marched strait up to him, and lied the pin&#xD;
right under his nose, and says IL, "Mistopher! do you&#xD;
darst to say that are pin 's brass?" He ketcht it out&#xD;
o' my hand and stuffed it into his pocket, and says he,&#xD;
"Well, bein' as you belong to the clergy, IL s'pose I 'd&#xD;
ought to accommodate ye." So I took my dagger-&#xD;
types and started off. Jest as I was a passing' out be.&#xD;

and says he, "Widder !" "That ain't my name," says&#xD;
I. "Miss Sniffles, I mean," says he, "I hope ye 'II&#xD;

got into the street, right by the corner of the store,&#xD;

x-xT.&#xD;
SAY I 'in disgusted with this old house; 't ~in'~&#xD;
fit for genteel folks to live in; looks as if 't was&#xD;
built in Noah's time, with its consarned old gamble&#xD;
ruif and leetle bits o' wonders a pokin' out like bird&#xD;
cages all round. Painted yeller, too, and such a hum.&#xD;
bly yeller; for all the world jest the color o' calomel&#xD;
and jollup 1"&#xD;
"But you are aware, Mrs. Sniffles "&#xD;
"I say 't ain't fit to live in. I 'in ashamed on 't. I&#xD;
fe4 awful mortified about it whenever I look at Miss&#xD;
Myerses and Miss Loderses, and the rest o' the hansoine&#xD;
sittiwations in 'the neighborhood, with their wings and&#xD;
their piazzers and folding' doors, and all so dazzling'&#xD;
white. It 's ridiculous that we should have to live in&#xD;
such a clistressid looking' old consarn, ~when we 're&#xD;
every bit and grain as good as they be, if noi~ rather&#xD;
better."&#xD;
"Nevertheless, the house is very comfortable."&#xD;
"Comfortable! who cares for comfort when gintili.&#xD;
&#xD;
ty 's consarned! I don't.. J say if you 're determined&#xD;
to stay in it, you 'd ought to make some alterations.&#xD;
in 't~ You 'd ought to higher the ruff up and. put on&#xD;
some wings, and build a piazzer jn front with four&#xD;
great pillars to 't, and knock out that are petition be.&#xD;
twixt the square room and kitchen, and put folding'&#xD;
dooi~ instid on't, and then build on a kitchen behind,&#xD;
and have it all painted white, with green winder&#xD;
blind. That would look something like, and then I&#xD;
dent feel ashamed to have genteel company come&#xD;
to see me, as I dew now. T' other day, when Ournel&#xD;
Billins and his wife called, I couldn't help n6~ticin'&#xD;
how contemptible she looked round at the house and&#xD;
fu.rniture-I actilly was so mortified I felt as if I&#xD;
should sink right through the floor."&#xD;
"But you know, Mrs. Sniffles-"&#xD;
"I say we 'd ought to' have new furnitur.-.--sofys and&#xD;
fashionable cheers, and curtains, and mantletry orna-&#xD;

day in to Mr. Bungle's shop, when I went in with&#xD;
Sister ~ibbins to look at her portrait that he 's a paint.&#xD;
in'. I seen one o' Miss Billinses picters there. 'T was&#xD;
a splendid one, as big as the top o' that are table, and&#xD;
represented an elegant lady a lyin' asleep by a river,&#xD;
and ther was a little angel a hoverin' in the air over&#xD;
her head, jest a gwineto shoot at her with a bow and&#xD;
arrer. I axed Mr. Bungle what 't was sent to his shop&#xD;
for, and he said how 't Miss Billins wasn't quite satis-&#xD;
fled with it on account o' the angel's legs bein' bare,&#xD;
~and she wanted to have him paint some pantaletts on&#xD;

tima, lie thought 't would be a very interesting' picter&#xD;
when he got it fixed. I think so tew. I dew admire&#xD;
pict&amp;amp;s when they ain't all dirty and faded out like old&#xD;
Bony there. Them Scripter pieces that Sister My~rs&#xD;
has got hanging' in her front parlor-them she painted&#xD;
afore ~he was married, strikes me as wonderfull inter.&#xD;
estin', especially the one that represents Pharoh's&#xD;
daughter a finding' Moses in the bulrushes. Her para-&#xD;
sol and the artificials in her bunnit is jest ~s natural as&#xD;
life. And Moses, he looks so cunnin' a lyin' there&#xD;
asleep, with his little coral necklace and bracelets on.&#xD;
0 it 's a sweet picter. And. I like that other one, tew,&#xD;
that represents Pharoh a driving' full tilt into the&#xD;
]~ed Sea after the Isrelites. How natural his coat-tails&#xD;
flies out. I think some Scripter pieces would be very&#xD;
appropriate for a minister's, house. We might git Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Bungle to paint some for the front parlor, ~nd our&#xD;
portraits to hang in the back parlor, as Miss Ntyers&#xD;
has their. But law me! what 's the use o' my talk-&#xD;

"Mrs. Sniffles, you must be aware that I am not&#xD;

tempted to conceal from you this fact-therefore, you&#xD;
must also be aware that there exL8ts an entire impossi-&#xD;

which you propose. Nor is it at all probable that the&#xD;
congregation would be willing to make such altera-&#xD;

parsonage is so great, that I have for soffie time past&#xD;

"My funds I"&#xD;
"Your funds, Mrs. Sniffles. It is a delicate subject&#xD;
and one on which I have hitheito hesitated to make&#xD;
inquiry, although possessing an undoubted right to do&#xD;
so. I have been expecting ever since our. union, that&#xD;

in a conversation which occurred between us in the&#xD;
parsonage grove."&#xD;
"You don't mean to say 't I told you so, and you&#xD;
darsent say 't I did."&#xD;
"A-hem-I mean to say that you did not deny it&#xD;
when I delicately alluded to the subject. On the con-&#xD;

tell you how 't was, and mabby you 'II take warning'&#xD;
by it. I remember egzackly when 't was-'t ~as in&#xD;
the month o' March, about tew year and a half arter&#xD;
Sister Bedott was married; yer uncle and me 'd ben&#xD;
keeping' company all winter: he come t' our house&#xD;
every Sabberday evening' regularly, besides always&#xD;
seem' me hum from singin'-scliool and evening' meet~&#xD;
ins, and so forth-.--.'t was town talk that we was en~&#xD;
gaged-Joshaway Magwire and Melissy Poole-that&#xD;
was the story all round. But all this time, mind you&#xD;
-he hadent said a word tew me about havin' on him,&#xD;
though I was suspectin' every day when he would.&#xD;
You see he was awful bashful. Well, one night&#xD;
('t was in the month o' March), we was gwine hum&#xD;
from singin'-school---rnaTy one on us dident say nothing'&#xD;
for some ways. At last yer uncle ham'd and haw'd&#xD;
tew or three tim~s, and then says he to me, says he,&#xD;
"Melissy I" says I," iley ?"-but he didn't ~ontinner&#xD;
for some time~-arter a speiiae hani'd and haw'd agin&#xD;
-and he says to me, says he, "Melissy 1', says I,&#xD;
"Well-what?" but still he didn't container. At&#xD;
last I see we.was a gittin' purty nigh huni-so I says&#xD;
to him, say I, "Joshaway~what was you a gwine to&#xD;
remark ?" So then he says, says he, "I was a gwine&#xD;
to say-" but his cwaidg&amp;amp;failed and he didn't finish.&#xD;

Afore long we come to the gate, and there we stopt&#xD;
(we used to stop awhile at the. gate in a general way),&#xD;
and' says he, "Melissy !" says I, "Joshaway Maguire,&#xD;
what dew you want?" "Why," says he," "I was a&#xD;
gwine to ax you-." Jest 'then yer granf'ther Poole&#xD;
opened the d'oor and came out, and so yer uncle went,&#xD;
off and I went in. Well-next day Hanner Canoot&#xD;
come in t' our house-and she begun to joke me&#xD;
about yer uncle-now I never could bear Hanner&#xD;
Canoot-she was a regular mischief-makin' old maid-*&#xD;
always a meddling' with every, body's bizness in the&#xD;
place-and sure as she see a young ~upp1e apparently&#xD;
attached to one another, she 'd insiniwate sutin' or&#xD;
other against 'em. She couldn't git no sWeetheart&#xD;
herself; and it made her awful cross-grained and mad&#xD;
- at them as could git 'em. I' hadent never had no,&#xD;
diffikilty with her-but I disposed her-and yer&#xD;
gram'ther Poole used to say to me frequently, "Me-&#xD;
lissy, dew be keerful what you say afore planner&#xD;
Canoot-she 's a dangerous critter"-and I was kerful&#xD;
in a general way. And then, you see, ther was,&#xD;
another thjng about it-there was her brother, Josiar&#xD;
Canoot-he 'd ben tryin' to be perlite to me tew or&#xD;
three year-and I wouldn't keep company with him,&#xD;
nor have nothing' to say tew him-and planner she&#xD;
know'd it, and felt awful spiteful to me on account o'&#xD;
that. Speaking o' Siar Oanoot-the last 'time I was up&#xD;
to Wiggletown, yer Aunt Bedoot telled me he was&#xD;

quite pertickler to her. lie hain't never ben married.&#xD;
I s'pose ixobody wouldn't have him-he wa~ so lazy&#xD;
and so consarned disagreeable, and so awful humbly.&#xD;
Why his hair was as read as blazes-and he hadent&#xD;
no nose at all-and what ther was on 't turned right&#xD;
up straight. When yer Aunt Bedott tell'd me about&#xD;
his stepping' up to her, I say, says I,, "Ii hope you&#xD;
won't incurridge him, Silly-for he 's a poor. shiftless&#xD;
critter. Why. no he ain't, another " says she, "he 's&#xD;
ben in the millentary and got to be Cappen Canoot."&#xD;
"I don't care for that," says I; "'t wouldent make no&#xD;
difference to me if he was gineral-he 's Si Oanoot&#xD;
and always will be." Well, I felt awful worried&#xD;
about it, and when I come hum, I teller yer uncle&#xD;
on 't, and says he, " 0 don't you be afeard 0~ Silly's&#xD;
niarryin' him. I '11 be bound he ain't no idee o'&#xD;
niarryin' her. She always thinks the men has serus&#xD;
intentions if they look at her"~-that's what yer uncle&#xD;
said-and I don't say but what 't i~ so-Sister Bedott 's&#xD;
a curus critter-tho' she 's a ni~e woman in the main.&#xD;
Well, I was a gwine to tell what planner said; sh~&#xD;
begun to joke me-and say~ she (I was a spinning on&#xD;
a gret wheel you know), well she begun at me and&#xD;
says she, "Melissy, they tell curi~is stories about you;"&#xD;
~vhiz-whiz-T-whiz went the wheel, an'~d I portended&#xD;

she. "Never.-not as I knows on," says mother,&#xD;
says she, "I don't know nothing' about no such&#xD;

she, "seems. to me yer rather hard o' hearing' to-day,&#xD;
Melissy." Whizi-z-z-z.z went the wheel louder 'n ever,&#xD;
U&#xD;
and I dident take' no notice o' what she said. Purty&#xD;
soon she bawled out agin, and says she~~.~" I guess&#xD;

how the critter found it out, dear knows). Well, I&#xD;
dident pay no 'tention, but I tell you I wa~ a gittin'&#xD;
awful mad. Arter a spell she gits up and 'comes and&#xD;
dumps herself right down aside o' me, and says she,&#xD;
"Say, Melissy, dew tell when you and Joshaway 's a&#xD;
gwine to step oIl~-~-he's a very nice young man, tho'&#xD;
I guess he won't never set the river afire." When&#xD;
she said that, I was completely ryled up. I 'd ben a&#xD;

her tellin' right afore mother about our comm' hum&#xD;
&#xD;

by the turnpike-and then sayin' "he wouldent never&#xD;
set the river aflre"-'t was tew much, I couldn't hold&#xD;
in no longer; so I turned round and shook my wheel-&#xD;
pin in her face, and says J, "Hanner Canoot-yer a&#xD;
medcllin' old maid. I wish you 'd mind yer own&#xD;
bizness and lem 'me alone about Josh Magwire-I&#xD;
wouldn't wzpe my old 6hoes on him." Now what did&#xD;
the critter dew when I spoke so? Why she snorted&#xD;
right out a laffin, and says she, "0, don't gitwin a pas.&#xD;

In the morning ' I got up with a tremenjuous headache,&#xD;
and looking' as pale as a ghost. Mother, she~ axed me&#xD;
whether or no I wasn't sick. IL telled her no; but all&#xD;
that day IL wasn't fit for no bizness-dident have no&#xD;

rigarlick IL didn't sleep a wink that night another.&#xD;
Next day I felt woss than ever, but IL was awful high&#xD;
sperrited, and IL was determined nobody shouldent&#xD;
know the reason. Thinks me if Joshaway 's a mind&#xD;
to use me so, he may and be hanged to him. IL ain't&#xD;
a gwine to kill myself On account o' him-he ain't the&#xD;
oniy young man in the universe. That was the~ way&#xD;
I talked-to myself-but talking' and dewin 's tew&#xD;

to hate him the better I liked him: Well, so it went&#xD;
on for a number o' weeks. Yer uncle never come&#xD;

went with Obey Foggerson. Afore bong,~ every body&#xD;

Says I," Why don't you never com ~to see us now&#xD;

went off. Well, next night he come t' our house, and&#xD;
~rter that he come every night-and I tell you 't v~as&#xD;
an awful cross to me to treat him any way decent-&#xD;
for IL hated the critter like pizen: but IL managed to be&#xD;
perlite tew him, and afore a week's time he poppt the&#xD;
question. IL tell'(l him 't was very unexpected and I&#xD;

He seemed apparently satisfied, and continnerd to&#xD;

long enough-and what to dew I didn't know. I&#xD;
was nigh upon crazy-my health failed-i hadent no&#xD;

oneasy about me. You see I was all the darter she&#xD;
had left to hum. Ye7r mar was married and gone and&#xD;
yer Aunt Bedott was married and gone tew. Well,&#xD;
I got to be a miserable critter. One evening, arter&#xD;

* Siar was a comm' that night to git his anser, and I&#xD;
wanted to git red on him. So I huv on my things&#xD;

found yer Aunt Bedott to hum alone. Yer Uncle&#xD;
]Iez wasn't h-gone to some meeting' or other-and&#xD;
Kiar (he was a baby' then), he was asleep in the cra-&#xD;

"for I 'r~ a~fu1 lonesome. Hez has gun off somewhere&#xD;

me up sky high, for makin' such an unprudent speech&#xD;
(she was unprudent enough herself; but she hadent&#xD;
no patience with any body else for bein' so). At last&#xD;
says she, "What's said can't be onsaid-the only way&#xD;
to mend the mischief is for 'Joshaway and you to git&#xD;
together and make it up somehow." "But how ca~i&#xD;
wegit together," says I; "I can't go to see him, and&#xD;
he don't never come to see me no more." Arter&#xD;

"that 's a real good idee-but you mustent let him&#xD;
know I 'm here, cause if you dew lie won't come, in."&#xD;
"I won't, sartin sure," says she. So she put on her&#xD;

to yer uncle. 0, Nancy! you 'ye no idee what a state&#xD;

* You see Joshaway wasn't to hum when she went, and&#xD;
SQ she stayed till he come. It did seem to me as if&#xD;
she was gone a year. At last I heerd ~em a comm'.&#xD;
They got to the door and says yer uncle, says he,&#xD;
"Good night." ~"0, you come in, dew," says yer&#xD;

So he sot down with his back to me-{I was a setting'&#xD;
where lie didn't see me), and she went off into t' other&#xD;
room and shot the door. Gracious sakes alive! I&#xD;
never in my hull life experienced such feelings as I did&#xD;

I felt clear discurridged,. and I jest~bust right out a&#xD;

and a minister's wife, tew. Though ~don't know but&#xD;
what all places are jest so. All goes on' slick enough&#xD;
yet-~but I 'm afeard 't won't last long. They hadn't&#xD;
ben here but three month&amp;amp;-and the folks are maldn'&#xD;
a terrible fuss over 'em. You know it 's the way they&#xD;
always dew when they git a new minister. They 're&#xD;
ready to e~t him up for a spell. And his wife-law-&#xD;
ful sakes! ther ~s nothing equil tew her. They. make&#xD;

themselves the most important characters in creation-&#xD;
and really expect the hull community to be a flyin'&#xD;
round all the time to attend tew 'em. And 't ain't at&#xD;
all surprising' it should be so-it 's according' to natur.&#xD;
But after a spell, the minister gits to be an old story,&#xD;
and the people begin to find fault with him. Some&#xD;
think he 's gittin' wonderful tejus; some think he ain't&#xD;
gifted in prayer, and he ain't sperritual minded enough&#xD;
to suit some others. / But the most general complaint&#xD;
is, that he don't visit enough. As if a minister could&#xD;
write tew sermons a week-sometimes threc-and go&#xD;
a visiting' every day besides. And then his wife-'t is&#xD;
astonishing' how public opinion changes consamnin' her&#xD;
The upper 'crust begin to think she 's a troublesome&#xD;

to take care of her, and all that. They pick flaws in&#xD;
every thing she says and does. And the under crust&#xD;
call her proud-say she visits Miss This, and don't&#xD;
visit Miss That.  f she invites some of her neighbors&#xD;
to drink tea with her-some o' the rest '11 be mad, be-&#xD;
cause she left them out, and say, she feels above 'em.&#xD;
And so it goes on-gittin' woss an&amp;amp; woss----she can't&#xD;
pleasenobody. After' a spell, the deacons begin to&#xD;
hint to the. minister that it 's gittin' rather hard to raise&#xD;
his salary, and wonder whether or no he could n't live&#xD;
on less. If he thinks he could n't, they wonder whetli-&#xD;
er or no he could n't dew more good in some other place.&#xD;
So at last they drive him to ax a dismission, and the&#xD;

THE DONATION      PARTY.         247&#xD;
poor man takes his family and goes off somewhere&#xD;
else, to go through with the same trials and troubles&#xD;
over again. And after they 'ye been settled about a&#xD;
dozen times, the minister begins to find out that all&#xD;
ain't gold that glitters; and his wife if she is a woman&#xD;
o' sense-discovers that she ain't a supernatural b~in~&#xD;
and must take care of herself, like other folks.&#xD;
That 's the experience o' ministers in general. I&#xD;
know it by my own observation-'and I 'm sure it&#xD;
had ben the case with the Scrantuntis. They 'd ben&#xD;
settled in a number o' places afore they come here;&#xD;
and Miss Scrantum, herself, told me that it took her a&#xD;
good while to lam that a minister's life must be a life&#xD;
o' trial and self:denial. But she did lam it at last.&#xD;
Miss Scrantum was an excellent woman. She wa'n't&#xD;
no ladder nor no gossipper. She stayed to hum and&#xD;
took care of her husband and children. If any body&#xD;
was sick or suffering , she was there to help 'em; but&#xD;
she seldom ~vent out any other time. She was good&#xD;
to the poor, lew-and divided her mite with 'em.&#xD;
You 'd a thought folks couldn't find fault with her.&#xD;
But they did. Some grunibled because she w'n't more&#xD;
sociable-and some was mad because she wasn't what&#xD;
they called an act ~ve Christian-that is-she wasn't wil-&#xD;
lin' to spend the heft o' her time a ru.nnin.' round on&#xD;
missionary bisness and distribitin' tracts, and so forth.&#xD;
But every body was outrageous at her, cause she tried&#xD;
to reconcile Liddy Ann Buel and Deacon Fustick's&#xD;

turn acted jest as a Christian ought to act in that biz-&#xD;

Ann and Miss Fustick got as mad at her as they was&#xD;
at one another.&#xD;
Parson Scrantum was a good man, tow-and a&#xD;
smart man-they didn't know how to vally him here.&#xD;
To be sure he went away of his own accord; but&#xD;
I s'pose if ho 'd a wanted to stay, they 'd a druv him&#xD;
off afore long-jest as they always dew-for husband&#xD;
said they was beginning' to growl about payin' the sal-&#xD;
ary. I tell ye, I felt dretfiil sorry when they went&#xD;
away, and so did yer uncle-we sot a great deal by&#xD;
em. And then they had such a nice family 0~ child-&#xD;
ren. Susan, the oldest, is as nice a gal as ever I&#xD;
know'd. I took a wonderful likin' tow her. Her&#xD;
mother used to let her come in often and set a spell&#xD;
with me. I was awful lonesome after Jefferson went&#xD;
off to study to be a doctor. Yer uncle was in the&#xD;
shop biggest part o' the day, and I used to be here all&#xD;
stark alone a goo&amp;amp; deal o' the time; and when Miss&#xD;
Scrantuin found out how loneson~e I was she used to&#xD;
send Susan over sometimes to see me. She 'd fetch her&#xD;
sewin' or her knitting' and stay an hour or tei~ir; and&#xD;
sometimes she 'd fetch a book and read tow" me, and it&#xD;
used to ehirk me up wonderfully. And Mr Scrantum,&#xD;
&#xD;
ii,&#xD;
it':'&#xD;
&#xD;
he used to come in once in a while, and always had&#xD;
something' good to say.&#xD;
"You said he went away of his own accord, aunt;&#xD;
how did it happen?"&#xD;
Wellt I '11 tell ye. When they gin hinra call to set-&#xD;
tle here, they agreed to give him four hundred dollars&#xD;
a year and a donation party every winter. Well, he&#xD;
thought he could live on that. Four hundred dollars&#xD;
was purty small, to be sure, but then they was very&#xD;
equinomical and* industriou~-dident keep no hired&#xD;
help-Miss Scrantuni and Susan done all the work&#xD;
themselves. And they thought the donation party&#xD;
would be quite a help-they never 'd had none-they&#xD;
wasn't custoifiary where they come from. Well, they&#xD;
managed to git along through the summer and fall.&#xD;
(They come here in the spring o' the year.) In De-&#xD;
cember follerin',the congregation gin 'em their first do.&#xD;
nation party. I didn't go; I never had ben to none;&#xD;
used to kind o' w~t' to go sometimes-but yer uncle&#xD;
wasn't wilin' to have me-he never approved o' them&#xD;
givin' visits. He thinks that when the people want to&#xD;
make their minister a present, they 'd ought to give it&#xD;
in a private way, and not go and turn his house upside&#xD;
down, to dew it. So I dident go to that one. But I&#xD;
don't think the Scrantums thought any the less of us&#xD;
for it; for they know'd we was as willing' to dew well&#xD;
by 'em as any o' the congregation was, for yer uncle&#xD;
always paid his pew rent promptly, and that 's more&#xD;

&#xD;
some that was richer done. And, besides that, we&#xD;
often sent 'em presents. They always looked upon us&#xD;
as the best friends they had here.&#xD;
Well, never heerd how the donation party come&#xD;
out. Miss Scrantum never said nothing about it, and&#xD;
I never axed her no questions; only I know that&#xD;
through the rest o' the whiter the minister's folks&#xD;
seemed to be more pinched than ever. I was in there&#xD;
quite often, and though they didn't make no com-&#xD;
plaints, I could see plain enough that they had to&#xD;
scrimp and save, and patch and turn every way, to&#xD;
keep any how comfortable; for they had house-rent&#xD;
to pay, and six children to support, and. it takes con-&#xD;
siderable to feed so many, to say nothing' o' clothing' and&#xD;
eddicatin' on 'em. They had a good deal o' com~iany,&#xD;
tew, and that costs something. You see they had to&#xD;
entertain all the straggling' agents that come along, for&#xD;
all sorts o' societies in creation.' They 'd stop there to&#xD;
save payin' tavern bills. It 's the way they always&#xD;
dew, ye know. Well, they contrived to live along&#xD;
till the next winter. The time come round for anoth-&#xD;
er donation party; and I says to yer uncle, says I-&#xD;
"Husband,, I war~t to go to that givin' visit~ "0,&#xD;
shaw," says he, "what do you want to go for ?" "0,&#xD;
says I, "'cause I think so much o' the minister's folks."&#xD;
"Well,?' says he, "that 's the principal reason why I&#xD;
should want to stay away from the givin' visit myself;&#xD;
as for you-of course you can do as ye please."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, then," says I, "if you hain't no objections, I'll&#xD;
go; and I wish you 'd go tew, jest for once. 'T ain't&#xD;
no use to ax me to go," says he; "it 's against my prm-&#xD;
ciples; I always mean to dew all I 'm able to support&#xD;
the Gospel and help the minister; buf as for them&#xD;
bees-li won't countenance 'em by my presence--that's&#xD;
all; and let me tell ye one thing, if you go, I '11 bet a&#xD;
cookey you '11 wish you hadent a went afterward."&#xD;
"Well that 's my look out," says I. "If you 're wil-&#xD;
lin'-I[ '11 go." "And, what '11 ye take ?" says he, "a&#xD;
stick o' tape, or a pint of emptin~, or what ?" "No, I&#xD;
'won't," says II," I '11 take something o' more vally than&#xD;
that." "Then you '11 be odd," says he.&#xD;
So after considering' a spell, I concluded to git, what&#xD;
Miss, Scrantum needed about as much as any thing, and&#xD;
that was a new bunnit. She wore a shabby, faded old&#xD;
thing, that looked as if it came over in the ark. Well,&#xD;
I thought I could git a ginteeler one in Harristown,&#xD;
than I could by havin' on 't made here. So I got yer&#xD;
N&#xD;
uncle to harness up the hoss for me, one afternoon,&#xD;
and hem' as he was tew busy to go with me himself; I&#xD;
went over and axed. Susan Scrantum to go 'long; I&#xD;
thought she" o d help me about picking' on 't out.&#xD;
She 'd be likely to know what would suit her mother.&#xD;
So I goes over and calls for Susan. She was delighted&#xD;
to go~Zshe dident git a chance to ride very often.&#xD;
Well, we druv to Harristown, and went into the best&#xD;
lookin' milliner's shop ther was there. "Now, Susy,"&#xD;

says I "I 'm a gwine t~ git a new bunnit, and I want&#xD;
your advice about what to choose." "Why, Miss&#xD;
Magwire," says she, "I thought you bad quite a nice&#xD;
one a ready." "Well, it is middling' nice," says I,&#xD;
"but I 'ye wore it tew wintei~s, and some ladies gits a&#xD;
new one every Winter~ ye know." So we examined&#xD;
all the bunnits in the shop, and I axed Susan which&#xD;
she liked the best. "I should think that one would be&#xD;
very purty for you," says she, pintin' to a plum-color-&#xD;
ed satin one that hung on a peg. "It's ma's favorite&#xD;
color, and tha~Sakes me lik~ it." Now that was jest&#xD;
what I wanted to know. So I axed the millinei~ to&#xD;
hand it down, and I tried it on, for I reckoned if 't&#xD;
wo~x1d fit me, 't would fit Miss Scrantum-slac was&#xD;
about my size-and it did fit nicely, so I bought it. I&#xD;
had to pay six dollars for 't--quite a launch out for me&#xD;
-more n ever I paid for a bunnit for myself. Susan&#xD;
looked as if she ~thought I was rather extravagant, but&#xD;
she did n't say nothing. Well, I put it in a bandbox&#xD;
I fetcht, and we went hum. When yer uncle come in&#xD;
I showed it tew him, and he was quite pleased with it;&#xD;
and 't was a clear beauty, plum-colored satin, trin~med&#xD;
ofF with a ribbing the sa~nie color, and lace bordering ,&#xD;
with white satin bows between, all quilled round the&#xD;
inside. I axed yer uncle if 't was more expensive&#xD;
than he was willing' I should give. "No," says he, "I&#xD;
don't begrudge the money. I want you to dew the&#xD;
laansome thing,; but 'V ~ou1d suit me a great deal bet'.&#xD;

"0 husband," says I, "I 'ye got my heart sot on at-&#xD;

he, "if you 're beset tew; but mark my words, I'll&#xD;
bet a dollar you '11 wish you had n't a went."&#xD;
Well, the day afore the party Jefferson come hum&#xD;
to stay a few days. I told him I was gwine to the&#xD;
donation party, and he said he 'd like no better fQn&#xD;
than to go with me. Jeff's always ready to go, you&#xD;
know. So he went and got a ream o' nice paper for the&#xD;
parson to write his sermons on. At last the day came,&#xD;
and I andy Jeff; we started off for the party. We&#xD;
went quite early in the~ evening , for I war4ed to be&#xD;
there 'fore 't was crowded. Ther hadent nobody come&#xD;
when we got there, only three or four ladies, that was&#xD;
a gittin' the supper ready. There was Glory Ann&#xD;
Billions, and Polly Mariar Stlllman, and Jo Gipson's&#xD;
wife, and old mother Parker a setting' th~e table. You&#xD;
know at them kind o' dewins they always have a sup-&#xD;
per sot for the company. The congregation provides&#xD;
the entertainment generally, but in~ this place the&#xD;
minister's wife has to find, a good share on 't. Miss&#xD;
Scrantum found the tea and coffee, and sugar and&#xD;
cream, and butter, and so forth. Some o' the neigh-&#xD;
bors sent in cake and pies, and cheese and biscuit.&#xD;
But Miss Scrantum was feared ther wouldent be&#xD;
enough o' the cake and pies-so she sent to the baker's&#xD;
and got a mess more. 'Well, .1 a~ed Miss Gipson&#xD;

where we should put our donations, and she told us&#xD;
to take 'em in the Parlor and lay 'em on the table.&#xD;
Ther was a table there a purpose to put the dry goods&#xD;
on. The proylsions was carried into the store-room.&#xD;
So w~ went in there and laid 'em on the table. The&#xD;
bunnit was pinned up in ~ newspaper. Jeff he sot&#xD;
down, and I started off to find Miss Scrantum. IL found&#xD;
her in the kitchen a makin' coffee. She looked dret-&#xD;
ful tired and beat out. I was real sorry I hadent a&#xD;
went sooner and helped her. She was wonderful glad&#xD;
to ,see me;. and I told her to go and dress herself; and&#xD;
I 'd make the coffee. So she thanked me and went-&#xD;
and I took hold and made the coffee. Ther was an&#xD;
awful sight on 't; I never made so much afore in all&#xD;
my born days, and II never expect to agim 'T was&#xD;
made in Miss Scrantum's biler. She 'd scoured it up&#xD;
for the occasion. 'T was a biler that held~ ten pails&#xD;
fufl-and it was brigunin full oV coffee. After I 'd got&#xD;
it made, II went back into the sittin'-room. They 'd&#xD;
got the table all sot. Ther was lots o' cake, and bis-&#xD;
cuit, and pies, and cold meat, and all sorts o' stuff.&#xD;
Then I went into the parlor, and lo and behold, Jo&#xD;
Gipson's wife and Miss Parker had ondid the bunnit,&#xD;
and was admirin' on 't at a wonderful rate. Jest then&#xD;
Mr. and Miss Scranti~ina and the children come in, aud&#xD;
dear me! how pleased they were with the bunnit.&#xD;
Miss Scrantum, she txied it on, and it fitted her to a T.&#xD;
But Susan! you 'd ought to seen Susan! She jumped&#xD;
&#xD;
and frisked around, and didn't hardly know what to&#xD;
dew with herself; she was so delighted. "0, Miss&#xD;
Magwire," says she, "that beautiful bunnit was n't for&#xD;
you after all, was it? What a dear good woman you&#xD;
are to make ma s~~h a fine present. She '11 look as&#xD;
nice as any body~ now-won't you ma?" They seemed&#xD;
wonderful pleased to see 5efferson, tew; and. Mr.&#xD;
Scranttun was very glad to git the paper-said 't was&#xD;
jist what he wanted. Well, purty soon the company&#xD;
7.&#xD;
begun to come, and they come pouring m thicker and&#xD;
faster till the house was crammed. 'The settin'-room&#xD;
door was locked, so as to keep 'mu out o' there till&#xD;
supper was ready-and I tell ye all the rest o' the&#xD;
house was jest as full as it could stick. The parlor and&#xD;
the hail and the bed-rooms was all crowded and cram-&#xD;
med. You 'd a thought from the number o' folks&#xD;
that was there, that ther 'd been a wonderful sight o'&#xD;
donations brought-but as true as I 'm a livin' critter&#xD;
-that table wasn't half full. But then ther was a&#xD;
good many families that fetcht one article i~o answer&#xD;
for the* hull. 'For instance, Deacon Skinner and bis&#xD;
wife axid four darters and tew sons was all there-and&#xD;
Miss Skinner fetcht a skein o' yarn to knit Parson&#xD;
Scrantum some socks. Miss Hopkins and her three&#xD;
darters and her son and his wife, that was a visiting' her,&#xD;
and. ihe~3' three children all come-and Miss Hopkins&#xD;

cards in. And the Miss Footes, three on 'em they&#xD;
brought Miss Scrantgni a pair o' cuffs. And all the&#xD;
flinghams, they fetcht a neck ribbon for Susan. And&#xD;
Deacon Peabody and his tribe, ther 's as much as a&#xD;
dozen on 'en~, they brought a small cheese. I heerd&#xD;
afterward that half o' it was a donation and t' other&#xD;
half was to go for pew rent. And Cappen Smalley and&#xD;
all his children was there. He fetch a box o' raisins&#xD;
rout o' his store, ther was twelve pound in 't, and Susan&#xD;
told me afterward that ten pound was to go toward&#xD;
pew rent, and the rest was a present. The Widder&#xD;
Grimes and Charity was there, of course. They&#xD;
dident go nigh the donation table for some time, and&#xD;
I was kind o' curus to know whether they 'd brought&#xD;
any thing, and so I watched 'em, and bimebye, I ob-&#xD;
served Charity go up slily, when she thought nobody&#xD;
did n't see, and lay a little paper on the table. I had&#xD;
the curiosity to see What was in it, so as soon as II got&#xD;
a chance I took up the paper and peeped into 't, and&#xD;
]o and behold! there were two skeins o' thread! did&#xD;
you ever? Wider Grimes is well oil; but she 's tew&#xD;
stingy to be decent, and Charity 's jest like her. Then&#xD;
there was ever so many belonging to other denomina-&#xD;
tions, that didn't bripg nothing'; they come to show&#xD;
their good will, to let folks see that they wasn't bigoted&#xD;
and prejudiced, though they did direr in a religious&#xD;
&#xD;
pint o' view, and git their supper. And besides them,&#xD;
I noticed a great many that I uever~ see before-no-&#xD;
body knows where they come from nor ~w~here they&#xD;
went tew. I guess they must a been raised up fo~ the&#xD;
occasion. And then ther w~s an awful sight o' chil-&#xD;
dccn that straggled in from every where. Doctor&#xD;
Lippincott, he was there, bowin' and scraping' i~ound as&#xD;
usual-awfully anxious about every body's heahh;&#xD;
and his wife, tew, as much consarned as he was-and&#xD;
their promising' red-headed boy, and interesting' darter,&#xD;
Anny Marier, with her six starched skirts on-ta1~in'&#xD;
up more room than ary ten decent drest girls in the&#xD;
'room. The doctor always goes to all the donation&#xD;
parties for fifteen miles round, to make himself popular,&#xD;
but nobody ~knows of his ever takin' 'any thin'. On&#xD;
this occasion, Anny Mariar took a book-mark to Mr.&#xD;
Scrantum, with a thing~on it that looked like a chop-&#xD;
pin' -knife, and a mess 0' French nonsense below it.&#xD;
But the greatest part oLtb~performance was the semi-&#xD;
nary gals and their donation. Ther was twenty-five&#xD;
on 'em, and what do you suppose they fetcht? Why,&#xD;
the hull kit and cargo on '~m had conspired together&#xD;
and made a rag-baby for little Adeline Sorantum, and&#xD;
rigged it up in gauze and tinsel, and they all come&#xD;
together and brought that. Miss Pinchem, their&#xD;
teacher, wasn't there. She was sick o' something . I&#xD;
guess if she had a come, she 'd a kept 'em a little&#xD;
straighter. Land o' liberty! I never see such an&#xD;

actin' set o' critters in all my born days! They&#xD;
carried on like all possess. I see some on 'em a&#xD;
flourishin' round Jeff-~-he 's always ready for a scrape,&#xD;
you know-and 1[ was feared he 'd .git to carrying' on&#xD;
with 'em and I wouldn't a had him for any thing, s&amp;amp;&#xD;
II gin him a caution. "Jeff," says I, "you let them&#xD;
seminary gaJls alone; they 're a wild set; 't ain't&#xD;
proper to cut up so in the minister's house," Jeff&#xD;
promised to keep clear on 'em-he generally does as&#xD;
I want him tew. Ii '11 say that much for J9fferson, he 's&#xD;
always been good about minding . But it went hard&#xD;
with him to dew it~ then ; he was ripe for fun, and&#xD;
determined to let off the steam some way or other.&#xD;
So he looks round and he sees Charii~y Grimes stuck&#xD;
up on the settee 't other side o' the room. Stiff as a&#xD;
poker and prim as a peapod-you know what a&#xD;
starched up, affected old critter she is. Jeff Went to&#xD;
school tew her when he was little, and she snapped&#xD;
his ears and cuffed him round, so he 's always hated&#xD;
her like pizen ever since. She 's ben tryin'~this twenty&#xD;
year to git married and can't make. it out. She 'd&#xD;
chased after Squire Fuller ever since his wife died.&#xD;
Squire Fuller got married about a month afore that--&#xD;
and yer uncle says he verily believes he did it in self:.&#xD;
defense, jest to get rid o' Gharity~Grimes~she bothered&#xD;
him to death; he couldn't go out in company but&#xD;
what she 'd contrive to hook on to him. TIe 's a very&#xD;

he 'd a done it, if it hadent a ben td get rido' Charity&#xD;

seemed to be uncommon contented for a widdiwer.&#xD;

Charity a sitting' 'there a tryin' to dew the agreeable to&#xD;
Capped Smalley (his wife hadent been dead long-.&#xD;
by the way, sthey 'd make a good. match, wouldent&#xD;
they?) Well, Jeff says to me, says he-" Mother,&#xD;
may I go stir up Charity Grimes ?" "I don't know&#xD;
what you mean by stirring' on her up," says I. "0,"&#xD;
says he, "111 jest want to condole with her a little on&#xD;
the loss o' Squire Fuller." "No," says I, "you&#xD;
needent dew no such thing; 't would be very nn*&#xD;
proper, indeed, and. very aggravating , tew.". "Well,"&#xD;
says he, "may n't I jest go and talk a little Shake*&#xD;
spare tew her? (Jeff 's always quotin' Shakespeare,&#xD;
you know.) "I 'm afeerd. you 'II say something sassy,"&#xD;
says I. "No I won't," says he. "I '11 be all4dIlin'&#xD;

demure as a deacon. "Good evening , Miss Gri~ues,"&#xD;
'says he. ~"Good. evening , Mr. Magwire," says she.&#xD;
"lit seems like old times to see you agin," says he;&#xD;
and. then he observed to Cappen Smalley-" I used. to&#xD;

Charity puckered up her mouth and grinned, and says&#xD;
she. "Yes, you was quite a boy then-~-.and I was a&#xD;
mere child myself; exceedingly youthful for a teacher."&#xD;
"Well," says Jeff; says he, "you hain't altered a spek&#xD;
since-.you hold your own amazingly-you: looked&#xD;
every bit as old then as you dew now; but how do&#xD;
you feel about these days ?" "Feels!" says she, picking'&#xD;
up her~.ears, "I feel as well as common-why should.&#xD;
ent I?" "Excuse me," says Jeff; "I only axed be-&#xD;
cause I did n't know but you felt rather nonplussed,&#xD;
put to 't for business as it were, since Squire Fuller&#xD;
got married. 'Old feller's ocerpation 's gone' now, I&#xD;
s'pose, as Shakespeare says." Gracious! how mad&#xD;
Charity was! She bristled up like a setting' hen, and,&#xD;
says she-" Jeff Magwire, I don't care a straw for&#xD;
what Shakespeare nor none o' the rest o' your rowdy&#xD;
acquaintances says about me, I'm above it; but who-&#xD;
ever he is, you may tell him he 's an impudent puppy,&#xD;
for calm' a young lady an old feller-and you 're&#xD;
another for tellin' on 't." So she got up and flounced&#xD;
out into the hail. The folks all giggled and seemed&#xD;
wonderful tickled; but Jefl he looked round as&#xD;
astonished as he could. be, and says he-" I wonder&#xD;
what, ails Miss Grimes. I thought for the life o' me&#xD;
she was a gwine to snap my ears, as she used to when&#xD;
I was young." I was vexed at Jefl and took him to&#xD;
task as soon as I got a chance; but he declared&#xD;

~t wasn't "old feller" he said, bu1~ something' else-.how-&#xD;
ever, it sounded. jest like it, any way.&#xD;
Just then the door was thrown open~ and we was&#xD;
invited out to supper. So we went sclueezin' and&#xD;
crowding' into the settin'-room. Some o' the folks&#xD;
pushed and jammed as if they were feared they&#xD;
shouldent git the best chance. Glory Ann Bihins sot&#xD;
at one end o' the table a pouring' coffee, and Jo Gip-&#xD;
son's wife at the 't other end a pc~urin' tea; and I tell&#xD;
ye, 't was as much as ever th~y'cou1d dew to pour it&#xD;
fast enough. Jeff, he flew round and, helped the&#xD;
ladies. For my part, I didn't feel like eatin' much-&#xD;
I was jammed up agin the wall and couldent stir hand&#xD;
nor foot. So I told Jeff to fetch me a cup o' tea and&#xD;
nut-cake, and he did; and~ I took 'em and managed to&#xD;
eat the nut-cake, but somebody. hit my elbow and&#xD;
made me spill the heft o' the tea; so I stood and held&#xD;
my empty cup, and looked on to see the performance.&#xD;
I say for 't if 't wasn't worth seem', I 'm mistaken.&#xD;
Why, if I was ~ starving' to death, I shovldent be&#xD;
willing' to act as some 6' them folks did. They pushed,&#xD;
and elbowed, and pulled, and hauled, and grabbed&#xD;
like crazy critters. 'T was amusing' to see 'em put&#xD;
down the vittals-I 'd a gin a sixpence, Nancy to had&#xD;
you there; 't wo~ild a ben fun for you to look on and.&#xD;
see the dewins. You 'd a thought the biggest part 6'&#xD;

donation party, and didn't expect to have nothin'&#xD;
more till the next one.&#xD;
The wimmin, as a general thing, took tea, and eat&#xD;
the cake and pies, and so forth. And the men, they&#xD;
let into the coffee, and biscuit, and cheese, and cold&#xD;
meat, and such like. I actily see Deacon Skinner&#xD;
drink six cups o' coffee, and eat in proportion. And&#xD;
Dr. Lippincott, my grief! 't was perfectly astonishin'&#xD;
to me that one mortal body could hold as much as&#xD;
that man put in-iio wonder he 's so fat-they say he&#xD;
gits the heft of his livin' away from home-contrives&#xD;
to git to one patient's house jest as dinner 's ready,&#xD;
and to another's jest at tea time, and so eats with 'em.&#xD;
And I wish you 'd a seen the Widder Grimes. Gram-&#xD;
many! how the critter did stuff! I took partickler&#xD;
notice of her, and I see she had an awful great work.&#xD;
bag on her arm, and every little while she 'd contrive&#xD;
to tuck a piece into 't when she thought nobody wasn't&#xD;
a looking . As soon as I got a chance, I hunched Jeff;&#xD;
and says .1-" For pitty 'a sake, Jefi do observe the&#xD;
~Widder 'Grimes." So Jeff; ]~e watched her a spell.&#xD;
"By George !" says he, "if tha~ ain't rich !" I tell&#xD;
ye, 't was fun for Jeff. Bimeby.-after she 'd got her&#xD;
bag purty well filled, s~ys Jeff to me, says he-." Xow,&#xD;
another, may I stir her up a little ?" "I don't care,"&#xD;
says I. So he reached forward' and hollered across the&#xD;
table tew her, loud enough for every body to hear-&#xD;
"Miss Grimes, may I come to your party?" "My&#xD;
&#xD;
262'&#xD;
&#xD;
268&#xD;
&#xD;
party ?" says she; "What do you mean ?" "Why,"&#xD;
says Jeff, says he, "1 reckoned from the size o' your&#xD;
bag, and the quantity o' provisions you was a layin'&#xD;
in, that you was a calculation , to make a party, and I&#xD;
thought Ii 'd like to come." Every body looked at&#xD;
Miss Grimes; and, I ~tell ye, she looked as if she 'd&#xD;
like to crawl into some knot-hole----and I don't know&#xD;
but what she did, for she made her disappearance&#xD;
amazing' soon after. And, then, them seminary gals-&#xD;
gracious! how they did eat! I s'pose they was half-&#xD;
starved at Miss Pinchem's. Afore long the table was&#xD;
purty well cleared, and Miss Scrantum had to go to&#xD;
the buttery and bring on all 't was left. I guess every&#xD;
thing in the house that could be eat, without stopping'&#xD;
to cook it, was made way with that night. When&#xD;
the seminary gals had eat all they wanted, they&#xD;
amused themselves a throwing' hunks o' cheese and&#xD;
buttered biscuit at the young men. After most o' the&#xD;
other eatables had been disposed of; Dave Runyon,&#xD;
great gump! went into the buttery and brought out&#xD;
the box o' raisins that was to go toward Cappen Smal-&#xD;
ley's pew-rent, and handed 'em round. Every body&#xD;
grabbed, especially the seminary gals, and children,&#xD;
till ther wasn't one left in the box. When supper wa~&#xD;
about finished, Jane Elizy. Fustick (she 's always a&#xD;
tryin' to dew something' cunning) , she went into th&amp;amp;&#xD;
store-room and got a chain o' sausages, that old Miss&#xD;
Crocker brought, and come along slily and throw'd&#xD;

standing' by the tea-board a drinking' a cup o' coffee.&#xD;
When he felt the sassages come flopping' round his&#xD;
neck, he was skirt, and whisked round suddenly and&#xD;
hit the tea-board, and knocked it off onto the floor,&#xD;
and smash went every thing on it!' What made, it&#xD;
more aggravating' was, ther was a dozen chany cups&#xD;
and sarcers on it that Miss Scrantum had fetelit out&#xD;
after the folks come out to supper. They was some&#xD;
that she sot a great deal by; her mother giv 'em tew&#xD;
her, and her mother was dead. She didn't bring 'em&#xD;
on at first, for fear they 'd git broke. She sot on all&#xD;
her common crockery, and borrerd a good deal at&#xD;
Smalley's store, calcul&amp;amp;tin' if any on 't was broke to&#xD;
pay for 't. But when she see so many folks come&#xD;
crowding' out, she was afeard ther wouldent be cups&#xD;
enough, so she fetcht out her mother's chany cups and&#xD;
sot 'em on the tea-board. But Glory Ann got along&#xD;
without usia' 'em, and there they sot, and when the&#xD;
tea.board fell, they fell tew, and every one on. 'em&#xD;
was broke or cracked. Gracious! how Miss Scranttim&#xD;
looked when she see her precious chany all to pieces.&#xD;
She dident say a word, but her lips quivered, and she&#xD;
trembled all over. But she seemed to overcome it in&#xD;
a minnit, and went away and brought a basket and&#xD;
begun to pick up the pieces, and Jeff and I took hold&#xD;
and helped her. A good many o' the company had&#xD;
gone back into the parlor; but ther was enough lefl&#xD;

work they made with 'em! While 'we was a picking'&#xD;
up the ,all of a sudden ther was'a terrible hul-&#xD;
lerballoo in tii~ parlor-Jeff and me rushed in to see&#xD;
what was the matter and gracious grandfather! what&#xD;
do you s'pose it was? Why one 0' them pesky sem-&#xD;
inary gals had throw'd a hunk o' cheese and hit Miss&#xD;
Scrantum's parlor lamp that was a setting' on the table,&#xD;
and knocked it over and broke it all to finders. But&#xD;
that wa'n't the wost on 't--where it tumbled over it&#xD;
fell right onto that plum-colored satin bunnit, and the&#xD;
ile run all over it in a minnit. More any body could&#xD;
ketch the bunnit, one side on 't, ribbon and all, was&#xD;
completely ruined Such a sight as 't was, you never&#xD;
sot your tew looI ~ eyes on [ All the ile that didn't&#xD;
go onto the bunnit was soaked up in the paper that&#xD;
Jeff took, that was a lyin' right aside on 't, and the&#xD;
biggest part o' that was spilled tew. My grief! how I&#xD;
did feel when I see that beautiful bunnit in such a&#xD;
condition I And poor Miss Scrantum turned . pale as&#xD;
death, and Susan cried like every thing. I axed Sam&#xD;
Lippincott (the doctor's red-headed boy) who 't was&#xD;
that throwed the cheese-he pointed out the gal, and I&#xD;
goes up to her, and, says I-" You good-foru'nothin'&#xD;
little huzzy hain't you no better manners than to be a&#xD;
throwing' cheese at oilier folkses lamps in that way ?"&#xD;
She was a real sa~sy little thing, and' dideut caje a&#xD;

grinned as imperdent as could be, and says she-." Ex-&#xD;
cuse me, marm-I had n't the mast remote idee o'&#xD;
hitting' the lamp. I meant to aim at Sam Lippincott's&#xD;
head, and mistook the lamp for it. I 'in' sure you&#xD;
can't blame me for makin sich a ncttrcd mistake." Did&#xD;
you ever! I was a good mind to hit her a cuff aside&#xD;
o' the head; but I didn't. I[ told Miss Pinchem on&#xD;
though, the next day-and she punished the huzzy&#xD;
by keeping' her on bread and water a week. Jeff said&#xD;
was a very equinomical kind o' punishment. Well,&#xD;
the party broke up purt*y soon after this scrape, and&#xD;
Jeff and me went hum. Jeff. went off to bed. Yer&#xD;
uncle was out; dear me! how I did dread meeting'&#xD;
him! Afore long he come in. "Well," says he,&#xD;
"how did the party go off?" "0, well enough;" says&#xD;
I; "but I 'in tired and sleepy, and we won't talk&#xD;
about it to-night." The fact is, I felt tew mean to tell&#xD;
him the truth-~-~but in the morning , when Jeff come&#xD;
down, he let it all out. ~y grief! how yer uncle did&#xD;
crow over me. "Did n't I tell ye so ?" sa~ys 'he;&#xD;
"don't ye wish you had n't a went ?" "Yes," says I,&#xD;
"if it 's any ,satisfaction tew ye to know it-I dew&#xD;
wish so." "I know'd ye .would," says he. I verily&#xD;
believe he was glad the bunnit got spilled.&#xD;
The nest morning , as soon as J got my chores done&#xD;
up, I went over to Mr. Scrantum's to see how they&#xD;
come on, and help 'em regulate a little. Murder-alive!&#xD;
such a 8i~ht as that house was, from one end to t' other,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I never sot my tew looking' eyes on! The carpets&#xD;
was all greased uj~ with butter, and cheese, and sassa~&#xD;
ges. And then the lamp ile had done more mischief&#xD;
than we know'd on the night afore. It had run off&#xD;
the table and made a cruel great spot on the best, car-&#xD;
pet; and I found Miss Scrantum a tryin' to wash it&#xD;
out. I sot tew and helped her-but 't want no use-&#xD;
't wouldent come out. Susan, she was a setting' on a~&#xD;
little stool a scourin' teaspoons, and cryin' as if her&#xD;
heart would break. "What 's the matter, ~dear?"&#xD;
says I-but the poor child couldn't answer me. So&#xD;
her mother' said she was a cryin"' about the bunnit&#xD;
hem' spilled. "No wonder," says I, "it 's enough to&#xD;
make any body cry. I s'pose you' can't dew nothing'&#xD;
with the bunnit, can you?" "0, yes," says Miss&#xD;
Scrantum, says she; "I 'ye ben looking' at it this morn-&#xD;
in', and I think I can get enough out of it to make a&#xD;
bag of. It '11 make a very nice bag-and I shall keep&#xD;
it as long as I live, for your sake, Miss Maguire." I&#xD;
looked at the woman with surprise. There she sot&#xD;
on the floor, a rubbing' away at thak grease spot, and a&#xD;
talking' as calmly about that six dollar bunnit, as if&#xD;
it hadent a cost more 'n six cents. I was kind o'&#xD;
vexed a her for not makin' more fuss about it. I ac-&#xD;
tilly begun to think she hadent no feeling , and didn't&#xD;
care for nothing. "And then," says I," to think o'&#xD;
their breaking' your beautiful chany-'t was shameful&#xD;
-a present from h'~\n other tow; and you sot so&#xD;

much by it; and I 'ye heerd ye say 't was the last&#xD;
thing yer mother ever giv ye." I was a running' on in&#xD;
that way when I thought I heerd Miss Scrantum sob&#xD;
-I looked up and she was a cryin' dretfully. She&#xD;
couldn't hold in no longer when I spoke o' the chany.&#xD;
I was sorry I said a word about it; but it convinced&#xD;
me that Miss Scrantum had feelings, deep feelings; but&#xD;
~he 'd larn't control 'em, poor woman! Well, I&#xD;
stayed a spell and helped 'em clean up, and then I&#xD;
went hum. Susan went to the door with me. When&#xD;
we got outside, I axed her whether ther was many&#xD;
provisions brought in the night afore. She told me&#xD;
to come to the store-room and look. So I went into 't&#xD;
and took a view, and there was tew or three ptinkins,&#xD;
a couple o' spare ribs (spare enough, tew, I tell ye),&#xD;
three or four cabbages, a chicken, what was left o'&#xD;
Deacon Peabody's cheese, and a codfish. "Is that&#xD;
all ?" says I. "Yes," says Susan, "and half o' the&#xD;
cheese, and one o' the spare ribs and the* chicken are&#xD;
to go .for pew-rent--I heerd pa tell ma so; but you&#xD;
mustent let 'em know I told you about it-for they'd&#xD;
think it wrong for me to speak of it; you won't tell&#xD;
'em, wil] you, Miss Maguire ?" "No, darling, " says I,&#xD;
"I won't let it out." So I went hum-and as I went&#xD;
along con~idefln' the matter, I come to a unanimous&#xD;
conclusion in my own mind, that donation parties wa~&#xD;
a humbug.&#xD;
Well, the next Sunday Parson Sorantum requested&#xD;
&#xD;
the male members of his congregation to meet him&#xD;
the next evening' at the rneetin'-house. Yer uncle&#xD;
~went to the meeting . I was in a wonderful fidgit to&#xD;
know what was the object on 't-and quite impatient&#xD;
for husband to come hum. When he come I observed.&#xD;
he was uncommonly tickled about something. "What&#xD;
is the matter? dew tell, for pity's sake," says I.&#xD;
"Why, the niinister's axed a dismission," says he.&#xD;
" You don't ~ says I. " Jest so," says he ; and then&#xD;
he haw.haw'd out alaffin. "What ails ye, man alive ?"&#xD;
says Ii; "I don't see what ther is to laff at in that; for&#xD;
my part, I look upon 't as a~great misfortin to Scrabble&#xD;
Hill, to lose such a minister as Parson Scrantum. I 'm&#xD;
astonished to see you laff." "Well, you Won't be,"&#xD;
says he, "when II tell ye about the meeting. " So he&#xD;
went on and gin me the hull description. He said&#xD;
that when Mr. Scrantum told 'em he wanted a dismis-&#xD;
sion, they was wonderlkil surprised-Deacon Skinner&#xD;
he riz~ and axed the reason. So Mr. Scrantum stated&#xD;
that he found it possible to1support his family on&#xD;
( his salary. Deacon Skinner said that was curus-he&#xD;
thought four hundred dollars was purty well up. Deas&#xD;
con Peabody said he thought so tew; especially with a&#xD;
donation party besides. Deacon Fustick, he put in, and&#xD;
said 't was ruttier a queer time for a minister to com-&#xD;
plain of his congregation, jest after they 'd gin him a&#xD;
bee-and he axed Dr. Lippincott what was his opinion.&#xD;
(Now Dr. Lippineott never had an opinion in all his&#xD;

life, on any subject-if he had, he never expressed it&#xD;
for fear of injuring' his practice; 't ain't even known&#xD;
what his politics is-he always contrives to be away&#xD;
on election days.) So he hemmed and hawed, and&#xD;
said that really he had n't made up his mind-he hoped&#xD;
Mr. Scrarttum 'preciated his donation party-he hoped&#xD;
the congregation 'preciated Mr. Scrantum; he wished&#xD;
-he wished things was n't sittiwated jest as they was&#xD;
sittiwated; and that was all they got out of him. Old&#xD;
Parker observed that minister's families, somehow,&#xD;
took more to' support 'em than any body else. Mr.&#xD;
Scrantum said that his family was as equinomical as&#xD;
they could be, but he had a good many children, and&#xD;
't was purty difficult to dew as he 'd ought tew by 'em&#xD;
on four hundred dollars a year; axed 'em whether&#xD;
they thought ary one o' them could dew it. Happen&#xD;
Smalley, rich old curmudgin, stuck up his head and&#xD;
said lie guessed he could dew it-any reasonable man&#xD;
could dew it-especially with the help of a donation&#xD;
party every year; but he hoped Mr. Scrantum's re-&#xD;
.quest would ~be granted unanimously for his part, he'd&#xD;
long ben of opinion they 'd ~ought to have a cheaper&#xD;
minister, and one that had n't such a snarl o' young&#xD;
ones. I don't s'pose Parson Scrantum would a said&#xD;
any thing severe if it hadent a ben for Cappen Smal-&#xD;
ley's speech. He seemed quite stirred up by it. He&#xD;
riz up considerable frustrated, and says he~-" I thank&#xD;
God, that what ever else I lack, He has hen pleased to&#xD;
&#xD;
give me plenty o' the poor man's blessins-Yea, a&#xD;
quiver full of them. And it '5 for their sakes, not&#xD;
my own, that I come here to-night. If I was alone in&#xD;
,the world, I could and would dew on a' most nothing&#xD;
~~~though Soripter says the laborer is worthy of his&#xD;
hire. Brethren, since I come among you, I 'ye done&#xD;
my best to be a faithful pastor-if I 'ye failed I hope&#xD;
to be forgiven. At first I had an idee that I should&#xD;
be able to rub along, on my small salary; and I don't&#xD;
know, but I might a done it, if it had n't a ben for&#xD;
one thing." Here he paused. "What was that ?" says&#xD;
Deacon Peabody. Mr. Scrantum continued-"] 'ye&#xD;
ben here tew ~rears, and you 'ye had the kindness to&#xD;
give me tew donation parties. I've stood it so fur,&#xD;
but I can't stand it no longer; brethren, I feel con-&#xD;
vinced that one more donat~oTh party would completely&#xD;
brealc me down. I will now retire and leave the meet-&#xD;
in' to decide as they see fit." Yer uncle said that for&#xD;
about five minutes after he went out universal silence&#xD;
prevailed. The first to speak was Deacon Skinner.&#xD;
"Strange 1" says he. "Gurus I"~says Deacon Peabody.&#xD;
~Reepiarkable 1" says Deacon Fustick. "Onaccouflt&#xD;
able 1" says Gappen Smalley. "Singular circum-&#xD;
stance 1" says Dr LippinCotta Then yer uncle got up,&#xD;
and, says he-" Gentlemell, I don't ~ee as any thing 's&#xD;
to be gained by setting' here and wonderin' all night.&#xD;
For my part, I think all Parson Scrantum 's said&#xD;
is true-his request is perfectly reasonable-and I&#xD;

&#xD;
move it be put to vote." So 't was put to vote and&#xD;
granted.&#xD;
A few days afterward the minister's folks packed&#xD;
up and started off for Miss Scrantum's father's, to stay&#xD;
till they could git another place. Yer uncle gin ~'em&#xD;
ten dollars when they went. He 'd a ben glad to give&#xD;
fifty if he 'ci a ben able, They was very thankful&#xD;
for 't, and the parson gin us his martin' blessing , and I'd&#xD;
rather have that than all Cappen Smalley's money.&#xD;
We all felt bad enough when we said good.by. Miss&#xD;
Scrantum cried hard-she diclent try to conceal her&#xD;
feelings then. Susan cried tew, and so did I-~---and we&#xD;
had a general time kissin' all round; as true as I live,&#xD;
Jeff, he kissed Susan tew-4ut don't you teaze him&#xD;
about it; I was glad to see him dew ~though Susan&#xD;
did blush awfully. They made us promise to come&#xD;
and 'see 'em if ever they got another sittiwation.&#xD;
We 'ye heerd lately that the parson had got a call to&#xD;
Bangtown. I don't kiiow nothing' about the village,&#xD;
but I hope to gracious it 's a place where donation par~.&#xD;

wife, was the first one that proposed it. She hain't&#xD;
lived l~ere but about a year, and she 's always ben&#xD;
used to such societies where she come from, so she&#xD;
felt as if she 'ci like to have one here. Miss Birsley's&#xD;
jest the woman to take hold. o' any such thing. She's&#xD;
a wonderful active little body, and a real gQod woman&#xD;
tew~ But, above all, she 's got a way o' sayin' jest&#xD;
what she pleases to every body without even givin' any&#xD;
offense. I 'ye often wondered how it was that Miss&#xD;
Birsley could speak her mind so freely and never&#xD;
make no enemies by it. Why, if I should venter to&#xD;
talk half so plain as she does I should be universally&#xD;
K hated. But she comes right out with every thing&#xD;
she thinks, and yet she 's more poplar than any&#xD;
other woman in the place. I guess it must be because&#xD;
folks has found out that she never says no wuss~&#xD;
about 'em, to their backs than she says to their faces.&#xD;

purposes? I told her that not known' I couldent&#xD;
say, for I hadent never belonged to none. So she&#xD;
went into an explanation; and after I understood the&#xD;
natur of 'em I liked the idee, and said I 'ci go in for&#xD;
it. So she wanted me to go round with her and talk&#xD;
it up to the folks and as I didn't see no reason why&#xD;
I shouldent, I put on my things and off we started.&#xD;
The first place we went to was the minister's-we&#xD;
thought we 'd like to see what Miss Tuttle thought&#xD;
about it afore we spoke to any body else.. Well, Miss&#xD;
Tuttle said she approved o' sowirt' societies-she&#xD;
thought they was quite useful when they was properly&#xD;
conducted. She didn't know how the plan would&#xD;
work here-at anyrateit was well enough to try,&#xD;
and she 'ci be glad to help us all she was able to.&#xD;
Next we welit to Deacon Skinner's. The Widder&#xD;
Grimes and Charity was there spending' the day, so we&#xD;
discussed the pint with 'em all. Miss Skinner and&#xD;
the gals seemed quite took with the idee; but Charity&#xD;
and her mother rather hesitated at first, but after&#xD;
they 'd axed forty questions, and i~re 'd told 'em all&#xD;
about it, and they 'ci satisfied themselves that they&#xD;
could git along without givin' any thing more than&#xD;
their time for an hour or tew a week, and git their&#xD;
tea to boot, they agreed to jine. So Miss Birsley took&#xD;
&#xD;
CONTEMPLATED SEWING. SOCIETY. 275&#xD;
down their, names. We didn't conclude what we&#xD;
should dew ~ith the avails o' our labor-thought&#xD;
we 'ci discuss that matter at the f1~t meeting , and Miss&#xD;
Birsley said she 'd have 'em meet to her house the&#xD;
next week a Wensday.&#xD;
When we come away from there, I says, says I,&#xD;
"We must n't forget to go to see Liddy Ann Buffi."&#xD;
"0 yes," says Miss Birsley, "the old maid that keeps&#xD;
the milliner's shop." Now I hadent the least idee&#xD;
she 'd jine, but I know 'ci she never 'ci forgive us if we&#xD;
didn't call on her. She 's a curiis critter-consates&#xD;
that some folks feels above her, and it makes her won-&#xD;
derful onconifortable. She 's always on a look out for&#xD;
slights and - insults, and. 0' course she thinks she gits&#xD;
plenty on 'em. She hates Deacon Fustick's wife like&#xD;
pizen, on account o' some remarks she heerd o' Miss&#xD;
13'ustick's inakin' about the os~ridge feaiAaers she wore&#xD;
on her bunnit winter afore last. Miss Fustick said&#xD;
afbre old Miss Orocker, that she thought Liddy Ann&#xD;
Buill was tew old to wear plumes. Old mother&#xD;
Crocker went straight and told Liddy Ann on't, and&#xD;
she was hopping' maci about it. She went round&#xD;
talking' about Miss Fustick at a terrible . Of&#xD;
course, Miss Fustick talked back agin, and it led to&#xD;
an awful quarrel that ain't made up yet. That bunnit&#xD;
was a curiosity though. Blue velvet ~ith a couple o'&#xD;

says I; "but we may as well call, for she '11 be awful&#xD;
mad if we don't." £~ ~ guess I can manage her," says&#xD;
Miss Birsley. "I know she thinks I feel above her,&#xD;
but I 'II see ef I can't convince her she~~ mistaken."&#xD;
So in we goes-Liddy Ann was a sewin' a straw&#xD;
bunnit. She 's generally pretty perlite to me-I s'pose&#xD;
she thinks I ain't proud-but when she see me long&#xD;
o M'iss Birsley, she thought I 'd naturally feel rather&#xD;
lifted up (bein' as Miss Birsley belongs to the upper&#xD;
crust), and so she 'd treat me accordingly. She looked&#xD;
up when we come in, and gin us a wonderful stiff&#xD;
bow-never laid by her sewin'-dident even ax us to&#xD;
sit down-but there she sot, head up, nose in the air&#xD;
(she 's got a singular way o' turning' up her nose at&#xD;
folks), with ~a real I 'm.as.good.as.you.be look on her&#xD;
face, and sewed away as if her life depended on 't. I&#xD;
felt rather aukerd, but Miss Birsley dident seem to.&#xD;
She looked down into the show-box that sot on the&#xD;
counter, and says she, "What a beautiful assortment&#xD;
o' ribbin&amp;amp;-you 'ye jes1~ got 'em up, hain't you, Miss&#xD;
Buill ?" *" I have," says Liddy Ann. "That green.&#xD;
and white plaid one 's a beauty," says Miss Birsley~&#xD;
"Won't you please to let me look at it ?" "Can't&#xD;
you lift the kiver and take it out herself?" says Liddy&#xD;
Aim, says slae. "0 yes, to be sure," says' Miss&#xD;

"When Ibuy ribbing I buy ribbins, and not shavin's,"&#xD;
says Liddy Ann. "So I see," says Miss Birsley.&#xD;
"I 'II take three yards on 't, if y~u please." I won-&#xD;
dered whether the critter 'd condescend to git up and&#xD;
wait on her-but she couldn't help it-so she riz with&#xD;
a great deal o' dignity and measured it off. Miss&#xD;
Birsley paid for 't; and then she happened to notice a&#xD;
straw bunnit that laid on the shelf-'t was one that&#xD;
Liddy Ann had been dewin' over for Loanthy Petti-&#xD;

don't see how you can make old straw look so nice."&#xD;
"When I bleech hats I bleech 'em," says Liddy Ann;&#xD;
"I don't tan 'em." "So I perceive says Miss Birsley,&#xD;
says she-" but I declare I 'd a' most forgot my errand&#xD;

"Why not?" saysL 1. "0," says she, "society here&#xD;

myself in the way o' bein' pu wn and stompt on&#xD;

Birsley, she raised her hands and eyes, and says she,&#xD;
(C The land alive !-----well, II declare, if I ain't beat now&#xD;
to hear you go on at such a rate, Miss Buill! You&#xD;
look well a talking' about aristocracy when you 'ye got&#xD;
more on 't than anybody else ~in the village. Why, I&#xD;
always thought you was very proud and haughty;&#xD;
and I guess it 's the general impression that you feel&#xD;
above your neighbors.. I was half feared to come in&#xD;
here to-day, you 'ye always been s~ scornful toward&#xD;
me; but now I am here, I feel as if I must speak&#xD;
plainly-.and I '11 tell you what, if you raly want&#xD;
society to be united, you must, be the first to se~ the&#xD;
example. You must lay aside some o' yer pride, and&#xD;
consent to associate with yer neighbors on ecjuil tirms."&#xD;
(Liddy Ann's nose come down a peg, and she raly&#xD;
looked qujte gratified. Thinks me, these ere folks&#xD;
that 's forever a blazing' away about aristocracy, are&#xD;
always wilhin' enough to have the name o' bein' aristo-&#xD;
crats themselves, and would be so actilly if they had&#xD;
a chance). Miss Birsley went on-" Now, if you 're&#xD;

hear herself classed. with the girls. She looked eny&#xD;
most good.natered "Well, I'll see about it," says&#xD;
she-" but why don't you take some cheers and set&#xD;
down?" "Becau~e you hadn't invited us tew," says&#xD;
Miss Birsley. "Dear me," says Liddy Ann, "how&#xD;
forgetful IL be 1" "INo matter," says Miss ]3ixsley,&#xD;
"we can't ~stay to set down now-but you will jine us,&#xD;
~ofl't you? we depend a'great deal on your taste, and&#xD;
the other girls all seem to give up to you in that re~&#xD;
spect." Liddy Ann fairly dropt her nose to a level&#xD;
with other follkses, and actilly smiled~ and says she-&#xD;
"Well, takin' all things into consideration, IL rather&#xD;
guess I wifl jine." So Miss Birsley took down her&#xD;
name, and told her not to fail to attend the first&#xD;
meeting' at her house next Wensday. She promised&#xD;
she 'd come; and. then she went to the door with us&#xD;

like enough showed us the door, and then went round&#xD;
and jawed about us afterward." "Jest so," says Miss&#xD;
Birsley, "the' only way to deal with such folks is to&#xD;
try to make them satisfied with themselves; make 'em&#xD;
think you look upon 'em as persons o' some conse-&#xD;
quence, and they '11 dew any thing you want 'em tew;&#xD;
and then, tew, there 's a satisfaction in it, 'because it&#xD;
makes 'em feel so much more comfortable and good.&#xD;

The next place we went to was Dr. Lippincott's.&#xD;
Miss Lippincott was pleased with the idee of a Sewin'&#xD;
Society, and said she 'd jine. A.uny Mariar sot there&#xD;
a playing' on the pia~ner, and we axed her if she&#xD;
wou'ldent take hold and help us? "Dear me, no !"&#xD;
says she; "I can't bear to sew, and, besides, II don't&#xD;
understand it. I never had to sew any." " flow old&#xD;
are you?" says Miss Birsley. "Eighteen," says Anny&#xD;
Mariar,, "The land alive'!" says Miss )3irsley, "eight-&#xD;

nephew; he was a studying' law with Mr. Birsley, and&#xD;
was quite attentive to A.nny M~riar.) "Well," she&#xD;
went on, "it 's high time you lariat, and if you ~fl come&#xD;

Miss Birsley said all this i,~ a pleasant, good..natered.&#xD;
way, but Miss Lippincott felt it, and so did Anny Ma-&#xD;
riar. IL guess she begun to suspect that, after all,&#xD;
't wasn't so wonderful lady-like not to know how to&#xD;
sew. She promised she 'd attend the meeting' next&#xD;
week. "That 's good," says Miss Birsley; "but don't&#xD;
for pity's sake, wear all them petticoats, for I don't&#xD;
think ther 'II bedroom for 'em if the meeting's large."&#xD;
When we come from there, we started for Deacon&#xD;

served Cappen Smalley a standing ' in his store door.&#xD;
"There 's the happen," says Miss Birsley, "now we '11&#xD;

it 's a great 'satisfaction to be laboring' for the good of&#xD;
our feller-critters. To what partickler purpose do&#xD;
yqu intend to devote the avails o' yer labor ?" "Well,"&#xD;
says she, "we hadn't decided yet; we shall wait till&#xD;
we git started, and then consider the niatter-ther 's&#xD;
enough ways o' dewin' good with money, you know."&#xD;
"Exactly," says the happen, says he, "and IL would&#xD;
suggest the idee o' your expending' yer funds in the&#xD;
purchase of articles o' clothing' for the poor; ther 's a&#xD;
great number in destitute circumstences in this place,&#xD;
and it strikes me it would be a great satisfaction to the&#xD;
ladies to furnish 'em with comfortable apparril."&#xD;
"That is a good idee," says Miss Birsley-" don't you&#xD;
think so, Miss Maguire" "Yes," says IL. "I 'm glad&#xD;
it strikes, you favorably," says the capped, says he;&#xD;
"and come to think, IL have 'on hand a variety o' ma-&#xD;

"You 're very kind," says Miss Birsley, "we '11 mention&#xD;
it at the meeting ; but we 'ye got to have some finds to&#xD;

"Well, raly," says the happen, says he, rubbin' his&#xD;

men 0' bigness that have large outstanding' debts are&#xD;
often more put to 't for ready money than a day-labor-&#xD;

Miss Birsley, "it must be so-it must be very tryin'&#xD;
to you to be scant o' money when you have a call to&#xD;
7~&#xD;
contribbit, it 's such a satisfaction to you to give -&#xD;

difference to us, we 'd jest as live take something out&#xD;
o' the store-for instance, some o' this ere cotton cloth&#xD;

"you needent apologize a word, this is very nice cloth&#xD;

looked awful womblecrbpt-I declare, I raly pitied the&#xD;

believe it? he actilly took the cloth and done it up I.--&#xD;
but I tell ye, I never see such an uncomfortable look-&#xD;
in countenance as his 'n while he was a dewin' on 't.&#xD;
"Now," says Miss Birsley, "I '11 trouble you to write&#xD;

took a pen and writ it, and I '11 be hanged if he did-&#xD;
ent look as if he was .a signing' his own death warrant.&#xD;
"Much obleeged to ye," says Miss Birsley, and she&#xD;
took up the cloth and we come off. Wben we got to&#xD;

bid him good-afternoon, and left him to his medita-&#xD;

"but we mustent let on how we got it out of him-.&#xD;
't ain't right to tell o' such things-we must let folks&#xD;
think he gin it of his own accord." "Jest so," says I;&#xD;

else. Well, it was a pretty heavy load to carry, and&#xD;
Miss Birsley proposed we should take it into her hus-&#xD;
band's office and leave it. The office was nigh by, so&#xD;
we goes in. Miss Birsley huv it down, and says she&#xD;
to her nephew, "There, Dick, I wan't you to bring&#xD;
that up when you come home to-night." Squire Birs-&#xD;
ley looked at it and read the writing , and says he,&#xD;
"You don't mean to say that Cappen Smalley gin you&#xD;
this ?" "To be sure he did," says she; "don't you&#xD;
believe his own words ?" "Pretty cunnin'in~ you,"&#xD;
says the squire, "to git it in writing , for fear he 'd be&#xD;

"jest as if I done it for that." Dick Wilson he look-&#xD;

Next we went to Deacon Fustick's. Miss Fustick&#xD;

Miss Fustick would say afore she expr~sed her opin-&#xD;

want to go into any thing without she can be head&#xD;

cordin' to her idees o' 'piety.) Of course, Miss Pea-&#xD;
body had her doubts tew, about jinin' the society.&#xD;
Miss Birsley and me, we both said tew 'em that we 'd&#xD;
no doubt but what the Sewin' Society would be the&#xD;
nicans o' dewin' a great deal o' good if 't was properly&#xD;
conducted. 'Well, Miss Fustick said she was onsartin'&#xD;
about hem' able to attend-her time was pretty much&#xD;
took i~p-she was Superintendent o' the Maternal. So-&#xD;
ciety, President o' the Daughters o' Temperance, and&#xD;
Corresponding' Secretary to the Friends o' Humanity,&#xD;
and she was afeard she couldn't consistently do much&#xD;
for the Sewin' Society; but she 'd try to attend occa-&#xD;
sionally-.at least she 'd make it a subject o' prayer,&#xD;
and try to find out what was duty in the case. Of&#xD;
course, Miss Peabody said she 'd try to attend tew.-.&#xD;
and then we axed ther daughters whether they 'd come?&#xD;
Sophrony Peabody inquired whether the gentlemen&#xD;
was a gwine to attend? We said that hadent been~&#xD;
thought of yet. And Jane Elizy Fustick said she&#xD;
hoped in all favor they wouldent-if they did, she&#xD;
wouldent any how-she couldn't boar to ~have the fel-&#xD;
lers sticking' round. "Why can't you speak the&#xD;
truth," says Miss Birsley, "and say you won't come*&#xD;
without they do ?" At last they both said they 'd jine.&#xD;
Next, we went into Jo Gipson's, and there we found&#xD;
Tom Hodges' wife a visiting' with her young one. Of&#xD;

and see me, bub." "Me won't I" says he. "He 'd&#xD;
rather stay by his mommy, hadent he, darling' ?" says&#xD;
Miss lodge. "Stay there, then, if you want to, little&#xD;
cross-patch," says Miss Birsley. I felt rather sorry to&#xD;
hear her speak out so, so I says, "What 's yer name,&#xD;
ducky ?" "Nun o' 00 bidness 1" says he. "0 now,;'&#xD;
says his mother, "can't he be a little man and tell the -&#xD;
lady his name ?" "Me won't I" says he, and he hit&#xD;
his mother a slap in the face. "Now that ain't prit-&#xD;
ty," says she; "mommy 'II cry," so she put her hands&#xD;
up to her face and pretended to cry. After a spell,&#xD;
says she, "Now tell the lady his name nice and pretty,&#xD;
and then mommy 'II stop cryin'." But inside o' tellin'&#xD;
his name, he begun to baw'l for more cake. "Wait a&#xD;
minnit, Miss Gipson," says Miss lodge, "I want th~&#xD;
ladies to hear him tell his name, he says it so sweet&#xD;
and eunnin'. Now tell the lady his name, and then&#xD;
he shall have more cake." "Yando Puffle Hogs,"&#xD;
says the little torment. "That 's a darling, " says his&#xD;
mother-." now, Miss Gipson may git him ~ great big&#xD;

says Miss Birsley. "Orlando Percival Jiodge," says&#xD;
his mother. "The land alive !" says Miss Birsley, "I&#xD;
declare I don't blame the young one for not wanting'&#xD;
to tell his name." "What! don't you like it ?" says&#xD;
Miss lodge. "No," says Miss Birsley; "I don't ad.&#xD;
mire double names any way, especially such awful&#xD;
jaw-breakers as that." "Why how you talk," says&#xD;
Miss lodge, "for my part, I think boys names always&#xD;
ought ~to be double. I told his pa I wanted to give&#xD;
him a name that would sound well in Congress one o'&#xD;
these days, and I think 'Orlando P. lodge' will."&#xD;
"The land alive I" says Miss Birsley, "I s'pose you&#xD;
think that Henry Clay 'd be a much greater man if&#xD;
his name was Henry P. Clay. And George Washing.&#xD;
ton, tew, no doubt he 'ci a made a great deal more&#xD;

to go." "So 't is," says she. "Well, ladies, we shall&#xD;
expect to see you at the ineetin' next Wensday; but,&#xD;
Miss lodge, don't you bring 0. P. IL, for I shan't&#xD;

bleses to present the case to ,Miss Stubbles and Jeru~&#xD;
shy. Miss Stubbles is quite a clever woman, and a&#xD;
good member o' society as fur as she dares to be; but&#xD;
she 's ciretfully under the Professor's thumb, and he 's&#xD;
a wonderful curus man; he 's got some o' the oddest&#xD;
notions in his head that ever you heerd of-thinks&#xD;
that property ought ~o be ecjuilly divided-calls all&#xD;
rich men oppressors, and all the laboiin' class abused&#xD;
and deprived o' their right~-holds that wen and wim-&#xD;
mm ought to be eddicatedjest alike. He 's always a&#xD;
whalin' away about the dignity o' labor-has jest ben&#xD;
deliverin' a course o' letters on the subject, and he calls&#xD;
all men that don't take hold and dew kitchen work,&#xD;
domestic tyrants; but he has such a blind, twistical&#xD;
way o' talking , that ~a body can't tell what he means&#xD;
half the time-husband says he don't know himself&#xD;
what he 's a driving' at.' When we got there, Miss&#xD;
Stumbles was in the side yard a splitting' 'wood; she&#xD;
come round and went in with us. They hadn't no&#xD;
fire only in the kitchen, so she took us in there; The&#xD;
professor was a churnin'-I thought I should go off&#xD;
when I see him. He 's a great, tall, lank, ungainly&#xD;
man, and the he stood with ~ check apron on, a.&#xD;
churnin' away like fury-ho did look like old Time.&#xD;
Their overgrown gawkey son, Natha~n, was a setting'&#xD;
the tea~table. There 's something' wonderful quizzical&#xD;
about the boy's looks. His clus is a great deal tow&#xD;

We inquired for Jerushy, and they said she 'd gone&#xD;
to milk. Well, we told our bizness, and axed Miss&#xD;
Stumbles if she 'd jine the society? She looked at the&#xD;
Professor to see hQw he took it afore she answered us&#xD;
-so I says, says I, "What do you think o' the plan,&#xD;
Professor Stubbles?" The Professor giv three or four&#xD;
awful hams to elear out his throat, and then says, he,&#xD;
"Did.I believe that an organization of this descrip-&#xD;
tion would be a labor-promotin' association, I would&#xD;
give it my. heart-willing approval." "No dotibt it&#xD;
will be so,'~ says Miss Birsley. "Ladies," says he, "it&#xD;
is high time that the, dignity of labor was appreciated&#xD;
world-wide." (We see he- was in for a speech, so we~&#xD;
let him go on.) . "It 's high time that the purse-proud&#xD;

beat, and begun to ham and clear his throat, and I see&#xD;
he was a preparing' to let off another speech, so I says&#xD;
to Miss Birsley, "Come, it 's time we was a gwiine."&#xD;
So we rizi to come away, and Miss Birsley says she,&#xD;
"Well, Professor Stubbles, I s'pose you '11 be offended&#xD;
if Ii don't invite you and Nathan to come to the Sewin'&#xD;
Society and help us, but as my idees respectin' the&#xD;
dignity o' labor differ from yourn, I think I 'd a leetle&#xD;
rather h&amp;amp;ve Miss Stubbles and Jerushy come." The&#xD;
Professor looked real wrath, but dident say nothing,&#xD;
and~we left him a churning' away for dear life.&#xD;
Well, the next day we went to the Parkers, and the&#xD;
Billinses, and the Stillman's, and the Pettibone's, and&#xD;
all round; but 't would take tew long to go over with&#xD;
the hull genealogy of all the calls we made. Enough&#xD;
to say, we found most every body agreeable to the&#xD;
plan; and when they wasn't in favor on 't, Miss Birs~&#xD;
ley' argyd 'em into 'V-so she sent a notice to Parson&#xD;
Tuttle, and yesterday he giv it out in inleetin', recluest.&#xD;
in' all the ladies o' the congregation to meet next&#xD;

I WISH to gracious you could attend one of our&#xD;
Sewin' Society meeting's. You never see nothing?&#xD;
to beat 'em, I '11 be bound for 't. We 'ye had tew now.&#xD;
At the first one, at Squire Birsley's, ther was twenty-&#xD;
five present. Miss Birsley had got some 'shirts cut&#xD;
out o' Caripen Smalley's cloth, and as fast as they&#xD;
come in she sot 'em to work-at least she gin 'em&#xD;
some work, but ther was so much talking' to dew ther&#xD;
was precious little sewin' done. Ther tongues went a&#xD;
good deal faster 'n ther fingers did, and the worst on&#xD;
was, they was all a running' at once. Ther was an&#xD;
everlasting' sight o' talking , but it did seem as if they&#xD;
wouldent never come to no decision in creation.&#xD;
'T wasn't expected we should dew much at tjae first&#xD;
meeting' more 'n to elect the managers, and make up&#xD;
our minds how often we should meet~-~and I begun&#xD;
to think wd shouldn't dew even that much, there was&#xD;
such o' sight o' discussion' and disputing' about every&#xD;
thing. Some was for meeting' once a week, and some&#xD;

&#xD;
thought 't was altogether too often,, Some was for&#xD;
staying' to teas and some was opposed to 't. Some&#xD;
thought 't would be a good plan to stay and work&#xD;
evenings, and some was of opinion 't would n't pay,&#xD;
hem' as we 'd have to burn so many candles and lamps.&#xD;
Ther wasn't nothing said about what object we 'd work&#xD;
for at the first meetin'-thought we 'd leave that till&#xD;
next time.&#xD;
Well, we talked and talked and talked, and the up.&#xD;
shot on 't was, Miss Birsley was appointed ~prasident-.&#xD;
Miss Ben Stillman, Miss Dr. Iaippiincott and Miss Dea-&#xD;
con Fustick, managers-.Polly Mariar Stillman secreta-&#xD;
ry, and ]I~iddy Ann Buill, tretcsurer. Moreover, we&#xD;
agreed to meet once a fortnight, at tew o'clock in the&#xD;
afternoon, stay to tea and work till dark. When we 'd&#xD;
got through with our bisness, we had tea-quite a&#xD;
plain tea. Miss Birsley don't approve o' makin'&#xD;
much fuss for Sewin' Society-.because if ye dew,&#xD;
ther '11 be some that '11 feel as if they couldn't afford&#xD;
to have it to their. houses. She didn't give us but&#xD;
one kind o' cake, but 't was light and good, and so&#xD;
was the bread; and we had sliced meat and cheese.&#xD;
Miss Birsley didn't say nothing about it but she hoped&#xD;
the rest would Loller her example. I made up my&#xD;
mind I wouk~ any how, whether the rest did or not.&#xD;
Well the ladies all eat as if they liked it, and they&#xD;
praised up every thing at a wonderful rate.- They&#xD;
never laid tooth to such bread in all their lives; the&#xD;
&#xD;
294&#xD;
&#xD;
butter was superfine; the cold meat was delicious; and&#xD;
for the cake it was a mystery to them how Miss firs-&#xD;
Icy managed to always have such first-rate cake.&#xD;
Miss Deacon P~abo4y declared she '4 eat such a hearty&#xD;
supper she was afeard she should be sick. After tea,&#xD;
Miss Jo Gipson invited us to meet at their house next&#xD;
time, and then we went hum. While we was in the&#xD;
bed-room a putting' on our things, I heerd Miss Pea.&#xD;
body whisper to Miss Stillman and say, "Did you ever&#xD;
see any thing to beat that tea in al1~.your born days ?&#xD;
No preserves at all !" "I never did," says Miss Still-&#xD;
man. "If II can't giv~ 'em a better tea when they&#xD;
meet to our house, I '11 give up."&#xD;
Well, at the next meeting' ther was about the same&#xD;
number present, and we talked up what we '4 dew&#xD;
with the money. The difficulty was, the members&#xD;
couldn't agree upon nothin'-.some wanted to work&#xD;
for this object, and some wanted to work for that.&#xD;
Miss Skinner and some o'the rest thought we 'd ought&#xD;
to sew for the missionaries, but most on 'em~ opposed&#xD;
it, 'cause they wanted to see what become o' the money.&#xD;
Miss Stubbles thought 't would be a good plan to es-&#xD;
tablish a school for the coldred sect-I s'pose the Pro-&#xD;
fessor put her up to 't-but nobody else didn't seem&#xD;
to be in favor on 't; and Sister Bedott (she attended),&#xD;
she said sh~ never '4 agree to that, 't would be money&#xD;
throw'd away, for niggers would be niggers, dew what&#xD;
ye would to elevate 'em. Miss Fustick (she come in&#xD;

to give the ,.~vails of our labor to the "Sons o' Tem-&#xD;
perance." "Sons o' yer granny," says Liddy Ann&#xD;
Buillsays she (you know she and Miss Fustick 's a&#xD;
quarreling. ) When she spoke up so, Miss Fustick&#xD;
looked awful mad, and got up to go: when she reach-&#xD;
ed the door, she turned round and says she, "Perhaps&#xD;
Miss BuilT would rather work for the Old Maids'&#xD;
Consolation Society' that they talk o' forming. Good&#xD;
afternoon, ladies I" and off she cut, afore Liddy Ann&#xD;
had time. to answer. The gals all tittered, and Liddy&#xD;
Ann lookt wonderful womblescropt: I don't know&#xD;
but she 'd a cleared~ out if Miss Birsley hadent a&#xD;
smoothed it ~over in her cunning' way; she laughed,&#xD;
and says she, "What, Miss Buill, you gal~don't mean&#xD;
to help the old maids, I hope? I say let 'em t~ke&#xD;
care o' tliemselvesY Liddy Ann grinned and looked&#xD;
quite satisfied.&#xD;
Wefl, they talked and talked and talked, jest as&#xD;
they did at the first meeting , to no more purpose neither~&#xD;
Qnly to git more ryleci up than they did then. It&#xD;
seemed as if every one had got a partickler pint to&#xD;
carry and was determined the rest should yield to 't.&#xD;
I tried a number o' times to make a proposition I 'd&#xD;
thought on, but ther was so many that talked louder&#xD;
and Iitster 'n what I coufd, that I couldn't for the life&#xD;
&#xD;
o' me git nobody to listen tew me. At last I went to&#xD;
Miss Birsley and told her my idee, and axed her what&#xD;
she thought on 't. She said she liked the notion.&#xD;
"Well, then, you propose it," says I," for I can't git&#xD;
'em to listen to me if I try till Doomsday." So she&#xD;
spoke out, and says she, "Ladies !" but ther was such&#xD;
a racket nobody didn't hear her. So she tried agin:&#xD;
"Ladies, I say 1" but still they didn't pay no attention&#xD;
Then she took the tongs and knock on the stove as&#xD;
loud as ever she could. "Order I" says she. They&#xD;
stoppt talking' then, and lookt round to see what she&#xD;
wanted. "Ladies," says she, "Miss Magwire has pro-&#xD;
posed an object to work for that strikes me as an ex-&#xD;
cellent one. She thinks we 'd better raise enough to&#xD;
repair1he meetin'-house, and for. my part, I think we&#xD;
couldent dew better: the meetin'-house is in a misera-&#xD;
ble condition; the plastering's a comm' off in ever so&#xD;
many places, and the pulpit 's a forlorn old thing,&#xD;
away up in the air; it 's enough to break a body's neck&#xD;
to look at the minister, and shakes like an old egg-&#xD;
shell. Mr. Tuttle says he 's almost afeard to go into&#xD;
it. Don't you think 't would be a good plan to tear&#xD;
it down and build another? Now don't all speak at&#xD;
once. Whenever shall dew nothing in creation if we&#xD;
don't have some sort o' order. Miss Skinner, what 's&#xD;
your opinion ?"&#xD;

Episcopal was all a pintin' at us for letting' our house&#xD;
o' worship be in such a condition. Miss John Brew.&#xD;
ster said she 'd long thougJ~t our meetin'-house was a&#xD;
disgrace to the village; she 'd no doubt but what&#xD;
't wQuld be an advantage to 'the cause o' religion to&#xD;
repair it, for the Widder Pettibone told her how 't&#xD;
if we 'd had a decent meetin'-house she wouldn't a&#xD;
went off and jined the Episcopals, but she got so&#xD;
disgusted with the old nasty house and so tired a&#xD;
stretc]ain.' her neck to see the minister, that she could-&#xD;
ent stan' it no longer.&#xD;
"The dear me !" says Charity Grimes, "T want to&#xD;
know if she gives that as a reason! Why, every body&#xD;
knows she went there 'cause Camel Dykenian's an&#xD;

"Yes," says PQlly Mariar Stiliman, "I guess it 's&#xD;
gin~rally known what took her there."&#xD;
"She 's a wonderful uneasy critter," says Miss Pea~&#xD;
body; "she 's bena Baptist and a Presbyterian, and,&#xD;
now she 's an Episcopal. I wonder what she '11 be&#xD;
next."&#xD;
Well, it 'S cause she 's a wictcter," says Glory Ann&#xD;

"Jest so," says Liddy Ann Buill; "widders'will be&#xD;

&#xD;
"Not if they can help it," says I. I was sorry as&#xD;
soon as I said it, Sister Bedott lookt so mad. I tell&#xD;
ye she gin 'me an awful blowin-up when we got hum&#xD;
-said every body in 'the room thought I meant her,&#xD;
and she didn't mean to~go to the meeting' no more. I&#xD;
don't know whether she will or not.&#xD;
Well, they 'd got hold o' the Widder Pettibone, and&#xD;
they didn't let her drop right off: if her ears dident&#xD;
burn that afternoon, I 'm mistaken. Some on 'em got&#xD;
so engaged talking' about her they stopt sewin' entirely.&#xD;
Bymeby Miss Birsley got out o' patience, and. knockt&#xD;
on the stove. "Order I" says she. When they got&#xD;
still, says she-" When the ladies have got the Wici-&#xD;

of appropriation' the money for that purpose ?"&#xD;
p&#xD;
"Well, I can't say as I disapprove on 't," says Miss&#xD;
Stiliman, "but Ishould think we 'd better not be in&#xD;
a hurry about makin' up our minds what we '11 dew&#xD;
with the' money."&#xD;
"What 's the use o' waiting' ?" say~ Miss Birsley.&#xD;
For my part, I think we should go ahead with more&#xD;
sperrit if we' had an object fixed on to work for." ." I&#xD;
think so tew," says Miss Stillman; "but, you know,&#xD;
we 'd ought to be unanimous." "Then why don't you&#xD;

"I mean," says Miss Stiliman, says she, "that we 'd&#xD;
ought to wait till ther 's a full meeting' a*'ore we&#xD;

"The land alive 1" says Miss Birsley, "II don't&#xD;

one."&#xD;
"The fact is," says Polly M~riar, stretchin' her&#xD;
great mouth from ear to ear and. displaying' all her big&#xD;
teeth.-(Jeff says her mouth looks like an open sepub&#xD;

"mar and me 's of opinion that we hadent ought to&#xD;
vote till Miss Samson Savage is consulted."&#xD;
"'Miss Samson Savage ain't a member o' the Society,"&#xD;
says Miss Birsley, "and she don't go to meeting' once&#xD;
in six months. I don't know' what we should want to&#xD;
consult her for, I 'm sure.~~&#xD;
"But you know," says Miss Stillman, "her means&#xD;
is such that she 's able to contribbit a gre~t deal to&#xD;
any object she approves of."&#xD;
"And we 'd ought to be careful about offending'&#xD;
her," says Polly Mariar, "for, you know, she with.&#xD;
draw'd herself from the Baptists because their Sewin'&#xD;
Society d.ident dew as she wanted to have 'em."&#xD;
"Did the Baptists break down after it?" says Miss&#xD;
Birsley. Jest then the door opened, and in marched&#xD;
Miss SamsQn Savage. But afore I go on, I 'd ought&#xD;
to tell you something about her. She 's one o' the&#xD;

a' most any bod~ else in tQwn. She was a tailoress&#xD;
when she was ~gal, and they say she used to make a&#xD;
dretful sight o' mischief among the folks where slie&#xD;
sewed. But that was when she lived in Yarmount.&#xD;
When Mr. Savage~ married her, he was one o' these&#xD;
ere speculators Wonderful fellers to make money,&#xD;
them Yarmounters. Husband says they come over the&#xD;
Green Mountains with a spellin'-book in one hand ~nd&#xD;
a halter in t' other, and if thcy can't git a ~choo1 to&#xD;
teach, they can steal a hoss. When they first come&#xD;
to our place, he was a follerin' the tin-peddlin' bisness;&#xD;
he used to go rumbling' round in his cart from house&#xD;
to house, and the rich folks rather turned up their&#xD;
noses at him, or he consated they did, and it made&#xD;
him awful wrath; so he determined he 'd be richer 'n&#xD;
any on 'em, and pay 'em off in their own coin. Old&#xD;
Smith says he ~s heerd him time and agin make his&#xD;
boast that he 'd ride over all their heads some day-&#xD;
dident seem to have no higher eend in view than to&#xD;
be the richest man in Scrabble Hill. He sot his heart&#xD;
and spul and bod.y on 't, and knowin' how to turn&#xD;
every cent to the best advantage, and bein' wonderful&#xD;
sharp at a bargain, he succeeded; every thing he took&#xD;
hold of prospered, and without actilly bein' what you&#xD;
could call dishonest, afore many years every body&#xD;
allowed he was the richest man in the place. So he&#xD;
built a great big stun house and furnished it wonder-&#xD;
ful grand; his wife wouldent have a bit o' furnitewer&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
made here-nothin' would de~ but she must send&#xD;
away to Philadelphy for 't. And such &amp;amp;rnitewer was&#xD;
never seen in the town afore! Such elegant sofys and&#xD;
cheers and curtains, and ever so many curus consarns&#xD;
that I don't know the name og and I guess she don't&#xD;
neither. So she sot up for a lady. She was always a&#xD;
coarse, boisterous, high-tempered critter, and when&#xD;
her husband grow'd rich, she grow'd pompous and&#xD;
overbearing . She made up her mind she 'd rule the&#xD;
roast, no matter what it cost-she 'd be the first in&#xD;
Scrabble Hill. She know'd she wa'n't a lady by natur&#xD;
nor by dedication, but she thought mabby other folks&#xD;
would be fools enough to think she was if she made&#xD;
a great parade. So she begun by dressing' more, and&#xD;
givin' bigger parties than any body else. Of course,&#xD;
them that thinks money ~s the main thing (and ther 's&#xD;
plenty such here and every where), is ready" to flatter&#xD;
her and make a fuss over her, and approve of 'all her&#xD;
'dewin's. If ther 's any body that won't knuckle tew&#xD;
her, I tell ye they have to take it about east. She&#xD;
abuses 'em to their faces and slanders 'em to tlieir&#xD;
backs. Such conduct wouldn't be put up with in&#xD;
a poor woman; but them that would be for drummin'&#xD;
~'me out o' town if I should act so, is ready to uphold&#xD;
Miss Samson Savage, and call it independence and&#xD;
frankness ~n her. She '~ got so she prides herself on&#xD;
'it. She says she ain't afeard to 4e11 folks what she&#xD;
think of 'em-if she don't like any body, they know&#xD;

it purty soon. Husband says she wouldn't ~think it&#xD;
no harm to set her neighbor's house a fire if she done&#xD;
it in the day-time. She shows her independence in&#xD;
another way sometimes, by rigging' out in' old duds&#xD;
that would disgrace a washerwoman, and training' round&#xD;
town, makin' calls and so forth, sometimes in an old&#xD;
wagin and sometimes afoot. It tickles her wonder-&#xD;
fully to hear folks whisper as she goes along-" Jest&#xD;
see Miss Savage I that 'll dew for her, but 't wouldn't'&#xD;
do for every body."&#xD;
When she goes out in company, she 'nopolizes the&#xD;
hull o' the conversation. She 's determined that every&#xD;
body in the room shall have the benefit of all she has&#xD;
to say. So she talks up so awful loud that she&#xD;
drowuds every body else's voic~, and they have to&#xD;
listen tew her whether or no. I was to a party a spell&#xD;
ago where she was, and from the minnit she come~ in&#xD;
-(thank fortin' she never comes any-always keeps&#xD;
the tea a waiting' for her~-I say, from the minnit she&#xD;
come till it broke up, she talked without ceesation. It&#xD;
did seem to me as if I should go distracted. In the&#xD;
course o' the evening , somebody axed Pardon Petti-&#xD;
bone's wife (she 't was Katy Carey) to play on the&#xD;
pinner and sing: she ~s a beautiful player, and I 'm&#xD;
very fond o' heaxin' her. When she sot down to the&#xD;
music, thinks me, Miss Savage will hold her tongue&#xD;
now, I 'm sure. But I was mistaken. She wasn't a&#xD;
gwine to be put down by a planner, not she, 'so she&#xD;

jest pitched her voice a peg higher and went on with&#xD;
her stuff-all about her hired help-what Bets, the&#xD;
cook, done; how Suke, the chambermaid, managed,&#xD;
and how Nab, the washerwoman, carried sail. I&#xD;
couldn't take no sense o' the music at all. Miss Still-&#xD;
man and Polly Mariar, and a few more, draw'd up&#xD;
round ~her and swallered all she said, but some o' the&#xD;
young folks that wanted to hear the .music, lookt as&#xD;
if they wished Miss Samson Savage was murder.&#xD;
But it 's plain to be seen with all her pretensions&#xD;
she feels uneasy and uncomfortable the hull time.&#xD;
I 'ye noticed that yer codftsh gentility always dew. She&#xD;
knows she ain't the ginniwine article, and so she tries&#xD;
to make up for 't in brass and bluster. If any thing.&#xD;
goes ~on without her bein' head man, she always tries&#xD;
to put it down. She was gone a journey when the&#xD;
Sewin' Society was started, and I s'pose she was awful&#xD;
mad to think we darst to git up such a thing without&#xD;
consulting' her. Miss Birsley called 'on her when she&#xD;
got ham, and axed her to jine. But she said she&#xD;
wouldent-she despised Sewin' Societies, didn't want&#xD;
nothing' to dew with 'em. Miss Birsley didn't tell no.&#xD;
body what she said but n~e; she know'd 't would&#xD;
make some o' the wimmin mad and scare the rest-&#xD;
but we both know'd 't wouldn't be long afore she 'd&#xD;

Well, as I said afore, she. came a marching . int@ the&#xD;

a dirty pink sun-bunnit, and an old ragged blue caliber&#xD;
open-gowud (what Jeff calls a shelaly) over her dress.&#xD;
She didn't so much as say "How-de-dew" to nobody,&#xD;
but streamed right across th~ room and sot down;&#xD;
then she huv her old sun-bunnit onto the floor, and&#xD;
draw'd a long breath, and says she-" Well, ZE vow&#xD;

"That 's jest what IL think," says Miss Stillman. "IL&#xD;

she said to Mr. Stillman, dear knows, for Miss Savage&#xD;

Ye don't ketch me a slanderin' folks behind ther&#xD;

Polly Mariar) "And where 's his wife, I 'd like to&#xD;

putty piece o' bisness, I must say, for you all to be&#xD;

I&#xD;

here a cliggin' away to fix up Tuttle's meetin.'-house,&#xD;
when she 'a to hum a playing' lady." "Miss Tuttle&#xD;
ain't very well," says I. '~ That 's a likely story,"&#xD;
says Miss Savage; and from that she went on and&#xD;
blazed away about Miss Tuttle at a terrible rate. Miss&#xD;
Stiliman and Polly Mariar, and a number more o' the&#xD;
wimmin, sot tew and helped her whenever they could&#xD;
git a word in edgeways; and such a haulin' over as&#xD;
Miss Tuttle and the. parson got, I never heerd afore&#xD;
in all the days o' my life.&#xD;
While they was in the midst on 't, Miss Gipsou&#xD;
come to the door and axed us to walk out to tea-&#xD;
she 'd ben out all ,the afternoon a glttin' it reddy-so&#xD;
we put up our work and went out. We don't have&#xD;
the tea handed round at our ineetin's as a general&#xD;
thing; we have the things sot on a long table; the&#xD;
woman o'the house pours tea at one eend, and we all&#xD;
stan' round and help ourselves, lit 's very convenient,&#xD;
especially where they don't keep no help. Well, we&#xD;
all took hold, and for a while Parson Tuttle and his&#xD;
wife and every body else had a restin' spell, for even&#xD;
Mis~ Samson Savage had other use for her tongue.&#xD;
She believes in dewin' one 1~hing to once. When ahe&#xD;
eats she eats-and when she talks she talks.&#xD;
And we had a real nice tea, I tell ye-biscuit and&#xD;
butter, and~ crackers and cheese, and cold meat and&#xD;
pickles, and custard and whipt cream, and three kinds&#xD;
o' preserves, and four kinds o' cake, and what not!&#xD;

"What delightful biscuit," says Miss Grimes.&#xD;
"They are so," says Miss Skinner; ~' but Miss Gip&#xD;
son never has poor biscuit." "0 shaw 1" says Miss&#xD;
Gipson, "you ain't in"arnest: my biscuits is miserable&#xD;
-not nigh so good as common. I don't think the&#xD;
flour 's first rate." "Miss Gipson, how dew you&#xD;
make crackers ?" says Miss Stiliman; "I r~ever tasted.&#xD;
none so good." "Now you don't mean so," says Miss&#xD;
Gipson. "I can make good. crackers, but them 's very&#xD;
poor; the oven wasn't jest right when I put 'em in."&#xD;
"I must have another piece o' this cheese, it 's 50 good,"&#xD;
says Miss Lippincott. "Where did you git it?'&#xD;
"Well, I got it of old Daddy Sharp: he generally&#xD;
makes excellent cheese, but IL tell Mr. Gipson old.&#xD;
Sharp's failed. fo:r once-that 's what I call poor cheese."&#xD;
"Dew taste o' this plum sass, Miss Peabody," says~&#xD;
Miss Brewster; "I never see the beat on 't." "I 'd.&#xD;
rather have these peaches," says Miss Peabody;&#xD;
"they 're delicious. It is a mystery to me how Miss&#xD;
Gipson always has such luck with her preserves.&#xD;
I never dew, and. I always take pound for pound tew."&#xD;
"This apple-jel 's the Glearest I ever see," says old. Miss&#xD;
I~arker. "How did you make it, Miss Gipson? Dic1~&#xD;
ent you dew it in the sun? I 'm sure it don't look as&#xD;

a most sorry I 'd made any preserves since I 'd eat&#xD;
some o' Miss Peabody's and. Miss Skinner's, their was&#xD;
so much nicer." So they went on. The whipt cream&#xD;
and. custard had to be gone over Miss Gipson had. to&#xD;
tell jest how 't was made-what flavorin' she used,&#xD;
and all that-though she declared she was ashamed.&#xD;
on 'to The caJ~e was praised. up: they must know&#xD;
how much butter ther was in this, how~xiany eggs it&#xD;
took for that and. so forth. Miss Gipson, of course,&#xD;
run it down-she could 4nake good. cake, but somehow&#xD;
she failed that time. A. person that dident know how&#xD;
wimmin always go on at such a place, would. a thought&#xD;
that Miss Gipson had tried. to hare every thing the&#xD;

Well, every thing arthly comes to an eend, and. so&#xD;
did. that tea after a spell, and. purty soon after we went&#xD;

Don't never mention that agin," says he; "I 'm&#xD;
ashamed on 'to I was green in' them days; now I 'ye&#xD;
got more enlarged views. The fact is, Aunt Magwire,&#xD;
Slabtown 's a great place. If 'd a stayed at Coon's&#xD;
Holler, ten to one, I 'd a went on in that snivellin',&#xD;

enough," says I; "and mabby got to heaven in it last.&#xD;
Slabtown is a great place, and no mistake." Sam did.&#xD;
ent ~ay no more.&#xD;
Eunice didn't seem to be very proud o' me, I 'm&#xD;
such a plain, homemade body. She never introduced&#xD;
me / to none of her genteel .acquaintances when they&#xD;
called; so, as I didn't have nothing to say, I used to&#xD;
have the benefit of all the conversation, and sartinly&#xD;
't was quite entertain'. They generally begun with&#xD;
the fashions. Next, they took up the subject o' hired&#xD;
gals, and when they 'd wore that out, the neighbor.&#xD;
hood in gineraihad to undergo a haulin' over. 'T was&#xD;
pretty much the same as it is in Scrabble Hill, only I&#xD;
think the Slabtown folks ihake ruther more fuss over&#xD;
each other to their faces, than what they dew in our&#xD;
place.&#xD;
One afternoon, there was a youngish married wo.&#xD;

dQn't seem to think much of her, but she considers&#xD;
her wonderful genteel. Her gintility seemed to con-&#xD;
sist in her wearing' more colors than I ever see on to&#xD;
once afore in all my born days. She had on a yeller&#xD;
bunnit, with a great pink ai~tfficial on it; a red shawl;&#xD;
and a green silk frock, and blue ribbon round her&#xD;
neck, and I forget what all; but t' was enough to&#xD;
make a body's eyes ache to look at her.&#xD;
After they' 'd gone over with the fashions, says Miss&#xD;
Teeters, says she: "I see you keep Marthy yet; how&#xD;
do you git along with her ?"&#xD;
But afore Eunice had time to answer her, the dbor&#xD;
was banged open, and the very Miss Hawkins they 'd&#xD;
ben talking' about come bowsin into the the room with-&#xD;
out ever ringin the bell. She was clear out o' breath*&#xD;
for she ~s quite a fleshy woman. Her face was as red&#xD;
as a blaze, and her'green satin sack was all one-sided.&#xD;
She looked as if she 'd fixed in a wonderful hurry and&#xD;
run all the way. "What 's to pay ?" says Miss Tee.&#xD;
ters and Eunice in a breath. She couldn't speak fo~r&#xD;
a minnit or so, she was so exhausted. I got up and&#xD;
giv her the rockin'-cheer I was a sitting' in, and she&#xD;
squoze herself into it, and says she-&#xD;
"Have you heerd the news&#xD;
"What news?" says Miss Teeters and~Miss Bentley,&#xD;
opening' their mouths and eyes and stretching' their&#xD;
necks. "What news ?-.--.dew tell, for pity's. sake I"&#xD;
"0 dear me, suz," says she, "I never was 59 chin.&#xD;
&#xD;
foundered' in all my life. Cousin Jeemes Was irk to&#xD;
our house not half an hour ago, and read it to Sary&#xD;
Ann and me. I thought Ii 'd run in and see if Miss&#xD;
Teeters had heerd on 't. They said she was over to&#xD;
Mr. Bentley's, so I come right on here."&#xD;
"Well, what ,is it, in the name o' wonder?" says&#xD;
Miss Teeters, says she.&#xD;
"0 dear me," says Miss Hawkins, a blowing' herself&#xD;
with her handkercher as hard as ever she could. "0&#xD;
dear me, ther 's the awfulest piece that you ever see,&#xD;
come out in the 'Ladies Book,' and it 's all about our&#xD;
Sewin' Society, takin' us off to an ioty, ~and tellin' all&#xD;
how we go on; and, of course, 't was writ in this vil-&#xD;
lage."&#xD;
"You don't ?" says Miss Teeters, says she.&#xD;
"It's a fact," says ~Eiss Hawkins. "And what 's&#xD;
worse yet, our minister's wife writ it."&#xD;
"How you talk 1" says Miss Teeters.&#xD;
"Well, I shouldn't wonder," says Eunice, says she,&#xD;
"for I 'ye heerd that your minister's wife writes for~tn~&#xD;
papers. But, pray, what does it say ?"&#xD;
"Oh," says Miss Hawkins, "as'true as I 'm a live&#xD;
woman, it 's got every one of our members in, and&#xD;
slkows us all up shamefully, only jest me and Sary&#xD;
Ann. I can't see as ther 's any body in it that re-&#xD;

wife, and Satnanthy Cooper~ and Tom Baily 's wife,&#xD;
an~'d Miss Ben Ourtis; and there 's a Miss Stiliman and&#xD;
her daughter, that 's meant for the Longs. They 're&#xD;
all fictitious names, to be sure, but it 's easy enough&#xD;
to tell who 's who. But the squire's wife ketches it&#xD;
the worst of all. I tell ye, it takes her off to fits.&#xD;
Nobody can mistake it. Jeemes wouldn't let us keep&#xD;
it,, or I 'd a fetcht it over. He war gwine to take it, in&#xD;
to the Bomanses. I hope you '11 get hold' on 't; for&#xD;
of all the abominable messes that ever Ii see, it 's the&#xD;
crownin' pint."&#xD;
"Well, I nev~r heerd the beat on 't," says Miss Tee.&#xD;
ters.&#xD;
"Nor I neither," says Eunice. "I should think a&#xD;
minister's wife might be in better business. Well,&#xD;
I 'm glad I don't belong to your Society. I ain't took&#xD;
off, that 's sarfin. But how do you know it actilly&#xD;
b&#xD;
means your Society ?"&#xD;
"Oh, that 's plain enough," says Miss Hawkins,&#xD;
"for it tells things that was positively said and done&#xD;
at some o' the meeting's. Jest how the squire's wife&#xD;
went on; calls her 'Miss Samson Savage."" (I begun&#xD;
to prick up my ears. Thinksme, what on airth does&#xD;
all this mean ?)-~-" But the mystery to me is, how the&#xD;
minister's wife got hold on 't. She wasn't there.&#xD;
somebody that was there must a told her. I wonder&#xD;
who 't was ?"&#xD;
Mi s Teeters turned rather red. I thought she&#xD;
&#xD;
looked kind o guilty; and says she: "It 's abominable&#xD;
.-it 's ridiculous! I 'II go right home and tell my hiis&#xD;
band how the minister's wife 's ben writing' about me;&#xD;
and I shouldent wonder if he should take the matter&#xD;
up-he 's cowhide a number of individdiwals for&#xD;
speaking' disparaging' o' me. But has the squire's wife&#xD;
heerd on 't ?"&#xD;
"No," says Miss Hawkins. "I stopt there as I&#xD;
come ~dong, but she 'd gone out 0' town. Won't she&#xD;
be mad, though; she 's such a fiery critter I"&#xD;
"I say," says Miss Teeters, says she, "it 's high&#xD;
time we got rid o' the minister; he ain't the man for&#xD;
us. .A genteel and intellectible congregation like our'n&#xD;
had ought to have a man o' great eloquential powers.&#xD;
And as for his wife, I never could bear her, with her&#xD;
old stripid dress that she wears every Sunday, rain or&#xD;
shine. I don't believe she was ever accustomed to&#xD;
ginteel society."&#xD;
"iNor I neither," says Miss Hawkins. "I took a&#xD;
dislike tew her when they first come here. I don't&#xD;
like yer mum characters that never say nothing' about&#xD;
nobody. It seems she 's ben~ savin' on 't up to let off&#xD;
in the newspapers. Bethi~r Nobles says she told her&#xD;
she thought our congregation drest tew much; and I&#xD;
shouldn't wonder if she did, for she' stuck to that old.&#xD;
straw bui~uit and everlasting' stripid dress all winter,&#xD;
and I s'pose it 's to set an example o' plainness afore&#xD;

she might better spend more time a dressing , and less&#xD;
a. writing' for the newspapers. And they say he in.&#xD;
courage her in it, and likes to, have her write. I wish&#xD;
they was both frirder off."&#xD;
"I wish so tew," says Miss Seeters; "'and I guess&#xD;
ther 's a good many that wish so. She ain't popular at&#xD;
all in our set. She never runs in sociably, as Miss&#xD;
Van Duzen used to. They say she goes a great deaV&#xD;
more among the poor folks, than she does among the&#xD;
giitteel part o' the congregation. And that 's a sure&#xD;
sign, I thi'nlc, that she 's ben more accustomed to ming-&#xD;
un' with them sort o' folks, than with such as we be."&#xD;
Well, they blazed away in that style for as much as&#xD;
an hour. I can't remember half they said; and Eunice&#xD;
she told 'em that if she was they, she wouldn't put up&#xD;
with it; she 'd make a fuss about it, and have the&#xD;
minister sent off.&#xD;
As soon as they 'd gone, Eunice burst out a laughing ,&#xD;
and says she: "Well, if that ain't the best piece o'&#xD;
news I 'ye heerdthL~ many a day. I 'ye always heerd&#xD;
that that Sewin' Society was a regular slander-mill,&#xD;
where the principal business is to brew mischief against&#xD;
the minister; and I 'iii glad they 'ye got showed up at&#xD;
last. The minister 's. a good man, and a smart man&#xD;
tew; but the biggest part o' the congregation is such a&#xD;
set of ignoramuses, that thy don't know a smart man&#xD;
from a fool. They always make a great fuss over&#xD;
their minister when he first comes; but if he don't&#xD;

preach smooth things tew 'em all the time, they soon&#xD;
contrive to starve him out or quarrel him off. When&#xD;
they gin this one a call, they agreed to give him five&#xD;
hundred dollars a year, and pay it quarterly. And it&#xD;
is a solemn fact, that half on 't hadn't ben paid yet.&#xD;
Betsey Hall, a girl that used to wash for 'em some-&#xD;
times, told me so. She said she 'd often listened to&#xD;
the door, and heerd the minister and his wife a talking'&#xD;
over their troubles; and she says that ther ain't more 'n&#xD;
half a dozen in the congregation that pay their dues&#xD;
regularly; and if 't wasn't for what the minister's wife&#xD;
gits for writing' for the newspapers, they wouldn't be&#xD;
able to pay their house-rent and keep out o' debt, no&#xD;
way. She said she overheerd him say to his wife one&#xD;
day: 'The quarter's rent '11 be due next Saturday, and&#xD;
I hain't a cent to pay it.' 'Keep up your courage my&#xD;
dear,' says she, 'perhaps I shall have something' from&#xD;
Philadelphy before then.' And Betsey said she guess-&#xD;
ed it come, for she was known' to the rent bein' paid&#xD;
the next Saturday. I couldn't help laughing ~ in my&#xD;
sleeve when Miss Teeters was a tellin' how much bet.&#xD;
ter Parson Van Duzen's wife was liked than this one.&#xD;
They abused her like a pickpocket when she was here&#xD;
and was always a running' her down. She couldent&#xD;

""0 law," says she, "I dident want to get mixed up&#xD;
in their quarrels." And then she throw'd on her&#xD;
things and run off to some o' the neighbors to tell the&#xD;
news and talk over it. She was gone till tea time.&#xD;
But she didn't ~have the satisfaction o' tellin' the story&#xD;
first, for every body where she went had he~rd it al-&#xD;
ready. News flies like wildfire in Slabtown. She&#xD;
didn't git hold o' the piece though; nobody hadent~~&#xD;
seen it, but they 'd all heerd about it. It 's wonderful&#xD;
how soon 't was in every body's mouth. When Sam&#xD;
comes hum he was full on 't-said 't was all over town&#xD;
-nothin' else was talked about~from one eend o' the&#xD;
village to t'other. Eunice was very anxious to read&#xD;
it; and Sam went to the bookstore to git it, but they'd&#xD;
sold every copy they had, and ther was a great call&#xD;
for more. Ther was a wonderful excitement about it.&#xD;
Sam said the Californy fever was nothing tew it.&#xD;
Californy and every thing else seemed to be entirely&#xD;
forgot for a spell. The wimmin laid aside all other&#xD;
business, and added round from house to house talk-&#xD;
in about the Sewin' Society. And the men, tew,&#xD;
they 're as fond o' 4atlin' and gossiping' in Slabtown as&#xD;
the wimmin. They met together in shops and stores,&#xD;
and ;bar-rooms and oyster-cellars, and talked it over.&#xD;
Wherever you 'd see a mess o' men standing' y6u night~&#xD;
know they was discussion' the Sewin' Society.&#xD;
In Slabtown, every body knows jest what every&#xD;
body else says and does. It seemed raly wonderful to&#xD;
&#xD;
me how all that was said was trumpeted round. Fri-&#xD;
vate conversations was blazed all ovet town, that must&#xD;
a ben carried by the birds o' the air, or else ther must&#xD;
a ben a good many ears occupied at a good many&#xD;
key-holes. I was wonderfully struck with this faculty&#xD;
in the Slabtown folks. They 're a community remar-&#xD;
kable for their inquiring' minds. If 't was applied to&#xD;
any useful purpose, ther 's no calculation' how much&#xD;
they might accomplish. If the government should&#xD;
ever conclude to make researches into the manners&#xD;
and customs o' the antipodes wader ground, I should&#xD;
advise 'em to send to Slabtown for an exploring' coin-&#xD;
pany. I '11 warrant 1they 'd find out ~ll how and about&#xD;
it for 'em. They 'd report all that 's a dewin' there,&#xD;
and ~ good deal more. So 't was about that article&#xD;
that was laid to the ministers wife's door. Every body&#xD;
know'd what every body else said and thought about&#xD;
it. The inquirin' minds was all at work. Every&#xD;
hour in the day ther was somebody a running' into&#xD;
Bentley's with some new story-something the Haw.&#xD;
kin~es or the Longs, or the Teeeters, or the squire's&#xD;
folks had said or dQne.&#xD;
"' And 'Miss Samson Savage,' "says Miss Teeters--&#xD;
"did you ever see such~ a perfect picter as that is o'&#xD;
the squire's wife ?-liow exactly it goes on like her,&#xD;
don't it? Any body that ever ~ee her wotQd~know it&#xD;
in a miiiute97'&#xD;
"But," says Teeters, "I don't see how the i8te~'8&#xD;

wife found out how she talked. Some 0' your mem-&#xD;
bers must a peached."&#xD;
Miss Teeters blushed, and says she: "dli, dear me,&#xD;
I 'm dreadfi.illy afeard she 'II think 't was me. If she&#xD;
should, she 'd hate me like pisen, and never invite me&#xD;
to any more o' her parties. ]i wouldn't git her ill-will&#xD;
for all the world. What shall I dew? I must run&#xD;
right over there 'fore any body else see her, and make&#xD;
it all straight."&#xD;
"That 's right," said Teeters. "I wouldn't be struck&#xD;
out o' her good books for no money. We '11 show&#xD;
her that we don't uphold the minister's wife in such&#xD;
conduct. But I must dew something tew. If she&#xD;
was only a man I could give her a cowhidin' or at&#xD;
least threaten to; but bein' she 's a woman I don't&#xD;
know what to dew."&#xD;
"I '11 tell ye, Teeters, wliat ye can dew," said his&#xD;
wife. "You can circulate a petition to get the minis-&#xD;
ter dismissed."&#xD;
"That 's the checker," said Teeters, with a terrible&#xD;
oath.&#xD;
So Miss Teeters flung on her things and started olE&#xD;
for the squire's. And Teeters s6t down to draw up&#xD;
his petition. When she got to the squire's, Miss Tee-&#xD;
ters hi.ur herself down on the sofy and fainted away;&#xD;

"No, I hadn't seen it1" says she. "What on 't ?"&#xD;
"Well, I 'm so glad you hadn't," says Miss Teeters;&#xD;

He 's intending' to start a petition to have the minister&#xD;
sent ofI You know we 'ye long ben tryin' to git rid&#xD;
of him, and this '11 be a good opportunity".-(Miss&#xD;
Teeters had always pretended to the minister that she&#xD;
was one of his best friends, and was always a running'&#xD;
t~w him with every thing the squire's;wife and Miss&#xD;
Hawkins said against him. Of course, he nor his&#xD;
wife hadent iio confidence in her. They understood&#xD;
human nater well enough to know she 'd talk against&#xD;
them behind their backs,)&#xD;
was natural enough, after all this parade, that the&#xD;
squire's wife should be in a terrible pucker to see the&#xD;
Lady's Book. So; after makin' a wonderfttl to do&#xD;
about it, and pretending' s]ie was awful unwilling , Miss&#xD;
Teeters fetcht her the book. At first, the squire's&#xD;
wife declared that Miss Savage wasn't meant for h~r,.&#xD;
but all herpctrti'cular friends insisted ttpon it that 't wag.&#xD;
So at last she had to give up, and, of cQurse, she was&#xD;
awful mad about it, and stormed away at a terrible&#xD;
rate.&#xD;
Miss Hawkins, she kept the ball a rollin'; devoted&#xD;
* her hull time to Tunnin' round the neighborhood and&#xD;
blazing' away about it. She was what folks call" toady"&#xD;
to the squire's wife, and every body said that the&#xD;
"Miss Stillman. in the piece, that was makin' such a&#xD;
muss, meant 'her, and she tho't so tew. But she tho't.&#xD;
that if she could make folks believe 't was intended&#xD;
for Miss Long, she could accomplish tew ends: she 'd&#xD;
&#xD;
git rid o' havin' the names o' Miss Stiiman and Polly&#xD;
M~riar' tucked onto her and her daughter, and, what was&#xD;
purty important, turn the Longs against the minister&#xD;
and his wife. Now the Longs was very stiddy, go-to-&#xD;
meetin' sort o' folks, and had always been very friend-&#xD;
ly to the ixiinister's family. So Miss Hawkins went&#xD;
puffin' and blowing, round town, makin' a terrible fuss&#xD;
about the "piece," and dwelling' particularly on the awful&#xD;
shame it was to take off the Longs so. One day she went&#xD;
into the squire's, and the squire's wife says to her&#xD;
says she: "Well, how do you feel about bein' hit off&#xD;
by Aunt Magwire? You ketch it about as bad as I&#xD;
dew."&#xD;
"0 shaw," says Miss Hawkins, "I ain't hit off at all.&#xD;
What makes you think I be ?"&#xD;
"Now? Hawky,"says the squire's wife, "it 's all non-&#xD;
sense for you to try to make me think that ain't meant&#xD;
for you and Sary Ann." "I know 't is."&#xD;
"Well," says Miss Hawkins, says she, "between&#xD;
you and me, the fact is, whether 't was meant for me&#xD;
or not, one thing 's clear, if we could make the Longs&#xD;
believe 't was intended for them, we should be pretty&#xD;
sure o' ~ittin' rid o' the minister. For, of course, Miss&#xD;
Long and Helen would feel dretf'ully hurt about&#xD;
bein' took off so by the minister's wife, and Mr. Long&#xD;
he 'd thi~~k jest as they. did. And if we can once git&#xD;
the Longs set against the minister's folks, they '11 have&#xD;
to quit in short order."&#xD;

"Wells that is an idee," says the squire's wife.&#xD;
"Hawky, you 's more c~rnnin' than I be. If 'Daddy-&#xD;

his back.-" once gits his dander up it '11 be all day&#xD;

ed to git considerable influence in the parish. It must&#xD;
be because h~ 's such a stiddy old poke, for he hadn't&#xD;
no more mind of his own than that pair o' tongs. I&#xD;
can turn him round with my little finger. I guess I '11&#xD;
go down and give 'em a stirring' up." So up she start-&#xD;
ed and off she traipsed to Mr. Long'sb She marched&#xD;
into the parlor, where Miss Long and Helen was a sit-&#xD;
tin', and makin' a low curchy, she says, says she:&#xD;
"Miss Samson Savage, at your service; and how does&#xD;
Miss Stillman and Polly Mariar dew to day ?"&#xD;
Well, to make a long story short, the Longs was&#xD;
made to believe that the minister's wife had. actilly&#xD;
ben showing' 'em up. Of course they was outrageous&#xD;
about it; and Miss Long talked harder against the min-&#xD;
ister's wife than' she 'd ever talked against any body&#xD;
afQre. She dident go tew her, like~ a Christian ought&#xD;
to, and ax an explanation, but she contented herself&#xD;
with calling' her an abominable woman and a skam~fid&#xD;
critter, and said she wasn't fit to be' a minister's wife,&#xD;
and so forth. And Mr. Long he jined in with the op.&#xD;
position, and wanted the minister to quit.&#xD;
And Teeters, b~e got up his petition, anti went blus*&#xD;
term' round with it, threatening' to cowhide every body&#xD;
&#xD;

LAW me, Nancy, why 't would take a week to tell&#xD;
all the saying's and dewin's that took place in&#xD;
Slabtown in consequence o' that article in the Lady's&#xD;

Such a tempest in a tea-pot! such an awful uproar&#xD;
~about nothing ! 'T was wonderfub-'t was amusin' tow.&#xD;
And what was the poor minister's wife about all this&#xD;
time? Why she was to hum, a minding' her own&#xD;
business as~ usual. Miss Teeters was heerd to say to&#xD;
several individdiwals, that she guessed that old stripid&#xD;
dress and straw bunnit wouldn't darst to show them-&#xD;
selves in church no more, when there was such an&#xD;
excitement. But Sunday came and there was the&#xD;
minister's wife in her seat, looking' jest as if nothing'&#xD;
had happened more 'n or'nai~y. The. members o' the&#xD;
Sewin' Society thoup:ht 't was very audacious in&#xD;
her.&#xD;
'T was ciir'us to see how all the persons that was&#xD;

own that they hoped to forward by makin' a hue and&#xD;
cry. There was the Slaters, they were dretful mad at&#xD;
the squire's wife, because she hadent invited 'em to&#xD;
her last party. And Mr. Sweezer had told 'em that&#xD;
the squire's wife remarked at her party, that she&#xD;
didn't invite the Slaters because she meant to be more&#xD;
select in her parties in futur'. Sweeper's very intimit&#xD;
with the squire's folks-a kind o' boot-licker tew 'em&#xD;
.-though he 's always slanderin' 'em to their~ backs.&#xD;
lb 's a regular man-gossip. Well, the Slaters was&#xD;
wonderful tickled to see the squire's wife git such a&#xD;
dressin' out, as they called it; so they went round ex-&#xD;
ultin' over it.&#xD;
Then thor was a number that was wonderful anxious&#xD;
to git themselves into notice, no matter how. And&#xD;
they blazed away about the imyropriety o' writing' such&#xD;
articles. They disproved on 'em entirely. But them&#xD;
that was tryin' to git into the squire's wife's good&#xD;
graces, was the most obstropelous about it. They&#xD;
called it abominable-awful! they hoped the squire&#xD;
would take the .law o' the minister's wife, and so forth.&#xD;
And some that was rejoiced to git hold o' any thing&#xD;
that could be turned against the minister, went sneak.&#xD;
in7 round takin7 it up in a sly way; they was very&#xD;
sorry it ~had happened, very; but it was all up with&#xD;
the minister now; he might as well pack up his traps&#xD;
and budge at once; for he couldn't be supported in&#xD;
Slabtown no longer, public sentiment was so against&#xD;

him. Then, tew, ther was a careful set, such as there&#xD;
is every where, that wanted to be "right side up ;"&#xD;
and not be~n' able to determine for sartin which would&#xD;
turn out to be the popular party, all they do4e, when&#xD;
the "Sewin' Society" was mentioned, was to shake&#xD;
their heads and look knownn, But the tew-sided&#xD;
party was the most numerous. They circulated round&#xD;
from the minister's friends to his enemies, and pretend-&#xD;
ed to belong to jest the side they happened to be with.&#xD;
To the minister's friends they said, "that was a first-&#xD;
rate article in the Book; 't was capital-'t was&#xD;
true to nater-it took off them that deserved it richly;&#xD;
and they hoped that the author 'd write more, and give&#xD;
'em another dig." When they got among the op.&#xD;
polite party, they said "'t was a slanderous thing-&#xD;
't was shamefui-.'t wasn't 'to be put up with;" and&#xD;
,then they carried back and forth all Vhey heerd on&#xD;
both sides, and made a sight o' mischief. Mr. Sweezer&#xD;
was one o' this kind. He had about as much as he&#xD;
could attend t6 for a spell, running' from one side&#xD;
t' other carrying' the news.&#xD;
But the most active o' the twosiders was ]3ethiar&#xD;
Nobles, an old gal that gits her livin' principally by&#xD;
visiting . She 's acquainted with every thing that goes&#xD;
on in the village; knows every body's business, jest&#xD;
what young folks are engaged, and who 's broke off&#xD;
* their engagements;.. who 's ben disappointed, and&#xD;
who 's distracted after who. She knows 'jest what&#xD;
1"&#xD;
&#xD;
couples lives~ like cats and dogs together, what~&#xD;
ones is livin' beyond their means, and who 's over&#xD;
head and ears in debt, and how every lady in town&#xD;
carries on her kitchenary consarns, how sorimpin' they&#xD;
live, and all that. She always has some great exciting'&#xD;
piece o' scandal on her hands that serves. for visiting .&#xD;
capital; and when one wears out she trumps up&#xD;
another. She 's an awful disagreeable old critter, but&#xD;
still ther 's plenty o' folks that 's willin' to ineourage&#xD;
her, for the sake o' hearing' her talk. Well, when the&#xD;
Sewin.' Society' muss tome up, she was on her high&#xD;
heels. It gin her plenty o' business for a spell. She1&#xD;
visited on the strength on 't for a month at least. As&#xD;
sure as the day come round, off started Bethiar Nobles&#xD;
on her scandal-peddlin' expedition. Wherever she&#xD;
went, the first question she axed was: "Have you&#xD;
seen that article in the Lady's Book?" and the next:&#xD;
"What do yQii think on't?" and what ever they&#xD;
thought she thought tew, and jawed away accordin'Iy,&#xD;
and spent the 'clay a tellin' what she heerd on both&#xD;
sides.&#xD;
One day she went to the minister's and spent the&#xD;
afternoon. After she 'd hauled out her knitting' work,&#xD;
and spread 'her white haffdkerchief across her lap for&#xD;
show (she 's an' awful snuff-taker, and carries an old&#xD;
rec~silk o~e in her pocket for use)-.after she 'd hauled&#xD;
out her knitting' work, says she ,"Have you seen that&#xD;

"I 'ye seen a number~ of pieces in the Lady's&#xD;
Book," says the minister's wife, "which one do you&#xD;
refer to?"&#xD;
"Why, that one about the Sewin' Society that&#xD;
appeared in the Jinuwary number," says Bethiar, says&#xD;
she.&#xD;
"I haven't read that number at all," says the&#xD;
minister's wife. ~" Mine was borrowed before I 'd had&#xD;
time to open it."&#xD;
Well, I've seen it," says Bethiar; "and I think&#xD;
it '~ complete. I hope the person that writ that 'II keep&#xD;
on writing , and give it to 'em again. I never see&#xD;
nothing' to beat that description of the squire's wife-&#xD;
it 's her to a T. They say she feels it tew. I 'm glad&#xD;
she, does; and I hope it 'll make her draw in her horns&#xD;
and remember her origin, and behave a little more&#xD;
decent. And Miss Teeters, I was glad to see her&#xD;
ketch it-ridicilous critter, neglecting' her children&#xD;
and flirtin' round with the young men all the time.&#xD;
And the Longs; that 's the best o' the hull; I tell ye,&#xD;
it done me good to see them cut up. I hope it 'II lam&#xD;
'em to think for themselves, and not pin their faith to&#xD;
big folkses coat-tails. They never have no opinion~ o'&#xD;
their own. I deii despise them Longs." The minister's&#xD;
wife interrupted her, and says she-.&#xD;
"Dident you spend t1~e day at Mr. Long's yester-&#xD;
day?"&#xD;
"Yes," says Berthiar, says she.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Seems to me it 's strange you should visit people&#xD;
you despise so," says the minister's wife.&#xD;
Bethiar was rather nonpiushed for a minute, and&#xD;
didn't seem to know what to say. She hauled out&#xD;
her snuff-box and took a mQn$itrous pinch, and draw'd&#xD;
round her nose one side and snuffed it up, and then&#xD;
draw'd it round t' other side and snuffed it up agin;'&#xD;
and when she 'd fixed out what to say, she begun :-&#xD;
Yes, I did spend the day there, and it 's the last&#xD;
day I '11 spend there for one while, I guess; for they&#xD;
had so much to say against you and yer husband that I&#xD;
was perfectly disgusted. They 're awful mad about that&#xD;
piece, and say you writ it. I told 'em, whether you&#xD;
did or not, I thought 't was a first-rate thing." So&#xD;
she run on, tellin' ever so much stuff that the Longs&#xD;
had said against the minister and his wife, and all&#xD;
how she tried to stop 'em, and felt so distress to hear&#xD;
'em. The minister's wife kept on sewin', and didn't&#xD;
make no farther remark. Bethiar stayed all the after-&#xD;
noon and evening , and talked and snuffed, and bored&#xD;
'em through and through.; and then went off declarirL'&#xD;
she 'd had a delightful visit.&#xD;
The next day she went to the squire's-Miss Teeters&#xD;
and Miss llawkins was there~ They was all glad to&#xD;
see Bethiar come in, for they know'd she 'd bring the&#xD;
news. She~,told 'em she 'd ben to the minister's; and&#xD;
they was wonderful cur'us to know how the minister's&#xD;

"not when I went in; she 'd. jest tucked it away when&#xD;
she h~erd the bell ring. I know'd by the looks o'&#xD;
things that she 'd ben a writing . She don't keep no&#xD;
help now; and I stayed .to tea a purpose to see what&#xD;
sort o' work she made gittin' vittals. When she went&#xD;
out to gi~ tea I offered to go and help her; for I did&#xD;
want to take a peep into the butt'ry and see what con.&#xD;
edition 't was in-they ~s~y these writing' wimmin is&#xD;
such sluttish critters about their houses. But she was&#xD;
tew cunnin' to let me see behind the curtain . She said&#xD;
she didn't need no assistance."&#xD;
"Why dident you insist upon 't and go ahead,&#xD;
whether or no ?" says the squire's wife. "That 's the&#xD;
way I 'd a done."&#xD;
"Oh," says Bethiar, "she '~ so kind o' stiff I&#xD;
darsent; but I. took a good look round when I went&#xD;
into the bedroom to take off my things. I wish to&#xD;
gracious you could see the quilt that 's on her bed I&#xD;
It 's the greatest curiosity in the quilting' line that ever&#xD;
I sot eyes on-old fashioned herring~ bone, the lines&#xD;
as much as tew inches apart-without stretching , full&#xD;
tewinches apart!"&#xD;
It 's cur'us, by the way, what a wonderful time the&#xD;
Sl~btown wimmin make about their quilts. Ther&#xD;
seems to be a continniwal strife there as to who shall&#xD;
git the most stitehin' on a quilt. They crowd and&#xD;
stuff 'em a~ full o' work as they possibly can. Folks&#xD;
&#xD;
that 's able to buy handsome bed-kivers, never think&#xD;
o' such a thing. But they '11 spend ever so many&#xD;
weeks a digging' away at a, home-made bed-quilt, and&#xD;
git the neighbors together time and agin, and stitch,&#xD;
stitch, stitch, stitch, as if their lives depended 6n 't,&#xD;
and not feel satisfied till every spot. as big as a six-&#xD;
pence is kivered with stitches. Eunice had a quilting'&#xD;
while I, was there. My eyes wa'n't good enough to&#xD;
work on the quilt, and Eunice didn't seem to be very&#xD;
sorry; for she wa'n't very anxious to have me make&#xD;
my appearance amOng her genteel friends. So I&#xD;
staid up in my own room. Ther was a stovepipe&#xD;
hole in the floor from the parlor where they was&#xD;
quilting , and I could hear 'em talk. Grammany, what&#xD;
a buzzing' they kep~up! I tell ye, every body that&#xD;
wasn't there had to take it, and no mistake. It would&#xD;
have to be a pretty ~skillful arithmeticker that could&#xD;
calculate how many characters can be pulled to pieces&#xD;
while one quilt 's a putting' together. But I was tellin'&#xD;
about Bethiar Noble's account o' her visjt to the&#xD;
parson's. She -went on to tell, and says she-.&#xD;
"And of all the teas that ever I sot down tew~, if&#xD;
that wa'n't the beat!" (she 'praised up every thing sky&#xD;
high while she was eatin' on 't). "Baker's bread as&#xD;

"But what did she say ?" says the scjuire's wife~&#xD;
"That 's the main pint. What did she have to say&#xD;
about the ~ieee ?"&#xD;
"She kept pretty mum about that, .1 tell ye," says&#xD;
Bethiar; "for, you see, I pretended I didn't know&#xD;

freely. I said that I guessed if the writer on 't thought&#xD;

the squire's wife and Miss Teeters, they 'd find them-&#xD;

squire's wife. "Wel], they ought to know it"&#xD;
*" They shcdt know it," says Miss Teeters.&#xD;
"I thought I should tell 'em on 't," says Bethiar.&#xD;
"Well, they must know it to-day, for to-morrow 's&#xD;
Sunday," says Miss Hawkins. "I s'pose you calculate&#xD;
to, spend the afternoon here, so I guess I'll jest rim&#xD;

Well, I kept a hearing' more and more every day,&#xD;
and what to make on 't, I dident know. 'T was all&#xD;
"Miss Samson Savage, and Miss Stillman, and Miss&#xD;
&#xD;
Fmstick and Miss Birsley." Thinks me, how on arth&#xD;
has all this about our Sewi~i' Society got out? and&#xD;
what makes the Slabtown folks think it means .them?&#xD;
Ii was wonderful puzzled, but thought 't wasn't best to&#xD;
say any thing about it. At last, one day, Sam got&#xD;
hold of a Lady's Book, and fetcht it hum; and Eunice&#xD;
took it and sot down to read the wonderful piece out&#xD;
loud. She turned along till she come to 't, and says&#xD;
'she: "Here 't is-..' Aunt Magwire's Account of the&#xD;
Sewin' Society at Scrabble Hill."' I tell you, I&#xD;
jumped as if I was shot: "Grammany," says I, "that&#xD;
means me!" Then it begun to crawl through my&#xD;
hair that the name o' the book was "God~y's Lady's&#xD;
Book," and says I: "I 'II bet a dollar it 's the same&#xD;
Mr. Godey that I know, and he 's went and printed&#xD;
off that story that I told him alout our Sewin' So-&#xD;
ciety." After I got calmed down a little, Eunice went&#xD;
on and read it; and, sure enough, there 't was, word&#xD;
for word, jest as I told it to Mr. Godey. I told 'em&#xD;
so.&#xD;
"Now, Sam;" says I," you go right off down~street,&#xD;
and tell every body that that are 's a ginniwine de-&#xD;
scription of our Scrabbl&amp;amp; Hill Sewin' Society, and&#xD;
nothing' else."&#xD;
"I shan't dew it," says Sam. "They wouldent be-&#xD;

see the fun go on."&#xD;

to take it tew themselves, let 'em; they deserve a&#xD;
usin' i~p, and I 'd be the last one to tell 'em they. had-&#xD;
Well; what to dew, I didn't know; I was a&#xD;
stranger there, and couldn't go round tellin? how 't was&#xD;
myself. But it did hurt my feelings aniazin'ly, to&#xD;
think that the minister's wife was a suffering' for 't, and&#xD;
that his enemies was a makin' a handle on 't to injure&#xD;
him and drive him away. I pondered on 't, and, pon-&#xD;
dered on 't; and, at last, I made up my mind that the&#xD;
least I could dew would be go to the minister's and&#xD;
explain it tew 'em. So I told Sam and Eunice what&#xD;
I meant to dew. But they tried to persuade me not&#xD;
to. Eunice said 't was all nonsense; she wa'n't ac-&#xD;
quainted with the minister's wife, but she looked like&#xD;
a very stiff; haughty woman, and she 'd treat me cool,&#xD;
and I 'd have my labor for my pains. But I deter-&#xD;
mined to set my own conscience at rest, so I put on&#xD;
my things and started off. Eunice tried with all her&#xD;
might to stop me, but my mind was made up. Sam&#xD;
wouldent go with me, nor tell me where they lived,&#xD;
so I had to inquire the way as' I went. 'T was a&#xD;
moonlight night, and I didn't have no trouble in&#xD;
finding' the house; but 't was onpleasant to be out&#xD;
alone in a strange place. When I got to the -door-&#xD;
steps' my courage failed, and I was afeard t&amp;amp; ring the&#xD;

her, that she was a gwine to mend. She looked like&#xD;

for some time. As I was a looking' at herr I noticed a&#xD;
smile come over her face. Thinks me, I '11 bet a dol-&#xD;

minute after, the smile went off; and she looked&#xD;
troubled and uneasy; thinks me, she 's a wondering'&#xD;

Scrantum, and her troubles. After a spell I plucked&#xD;
up courage and pulled the bell. She come to the&#xD;

stammered out: "I hope you '11 pardon a stranger for&#xD;

"every body 's welcome to the minister's house." So&#xD;
then, I felt relieved, and says I: "I come from Scrab-&#xD;

for 't. I was so distress when I heerd they was a lay.&#xD;

that I felt as if I must come right over and see you,&#xD;
though you was a stranger. If any body 's to blame,&#xD;
I 'in willing' to bear it."&#xD;
"0 ne," says she, "don't you fret yourself a bit&#xD;
about it. If people choose to fit your coats to their&#xD;

own backs, 't ain't your fault; and if they fit nice and&#xD;
snug, perhaps they 'II do as good service as if they&#xD;

have something' still worse."&#xD;
"But," says I," what if they should drive you away&#xD;

She smiled, and dident say nothing .&#xD;
"Well," says I, "to judge from what I've seen o'&#xD;

they do chive you awa~r, they can't possibly drive you&#xD;

Well, I'll tell you, for I think 't was one C&#xD;

m~n as ever walked shoe-leather. I alwa&#xD;
so and so did husband, though ther was a&#xD;
folks in Wiggletown looked upon him as c&#xD;
tion, 'catise he had so much sanctimony.&#xD;
from Meddleville to oin' town, and he was&#xD;
Liii pious, and made such an awful parade c&#xD;

he begun meddling' in every bo~ ly's bigness the worst&#xD;
way, watching' all the naborhood, and takin' on 'em to&#xD;
dew for every little thing that didn't happen to come&#xD;
come up to his idees o' duty. This he called "consarn&#xD;
for the welfaiie o' Zion." As sure as ther was a&#xD;
party.o' young folks, there was Deacon Whipple's long&#xD;
nose poked into some o' the wonders to pry out what&#xD;
was done. And if ther was an church members&#xD;
among 'em, and they happened to play "Button-but.&#xD;
ton I whose got the button ?" or dans~ round a little,&#xD;
he 'd have 'em hauled up before the session to anser&#xD;
for 't. It seemed to dew him a deal o' good to ketch&#xD;
any o' the brethren or sisters a tripping~ . A body 'd a&#xD;
thought he spent 1~he heft of his time a pryin' into&#xD;
other folks' bizness, but some how or other he man-&#xD;
aged to take care of his own tew; he was a tailor by&#xD;
trade, and a regular old cabbagin' skinflint to boot.&#xD;
That reminds me o' what Jo Snyder said to him once.&#xD;
You see he was an awful stingy critter, and so was&#xD;
Miss Whipple. The prenticee~ used to complain dret-&#xD;
fully o' ther livin'-said they was nigh about starved.&#xD;
Well, Jo Snyder he stuck his head into the shop win-&#xD;
der one day and says he (Jo was an independent crit-&#xD;
ter), says he, "Deacon, how comes it you starve yer&#xD;
'printices so, when you 're always so flush o' cabbage ?"&#xD;
The deacon was awful mad. Says he to Jo, "If you&#xD;
was professor you 'd ketch it." He wa~ a monstrous&#xD;
mean-~oks~n' man tew. You 'd a know'd. to see him in&#xD;
&#xD;

the street that he was contracted critter-~had a stin*&#xD;
gy kind of a walk-went along as if he begrudged&#xD;
the room he took up. The circumstance I was a&#xD;
gwine to tell took place when he 'd ben deacon only&#xD;
a little risin' tew year-and it 's a sollem fact, ther 'd&#xD;
ben more cases o' deseplyne in that short time than&#xD;
ther ever was afore sense the place was settled. Now&#xD;
Deacon Bedott wa'n't such a man at all. He was&#xD;
great on praying' and exortin', but he dident meddle in&#xD;
his nabors' Qonsarns, nor think himself so much pious.&#xD;
er and better 'n ~ll the rest o' creation. Well, the next&#xD;
fall arter we come~ away from Wiggletown, husband&#xD;
and me went out there a visiting . You see N~other&#xD;
Poole and Mother Magwire both lived there, and Sis.&#xD;
ter Beddtt tew, and I spent the time visiting' round&#xD;
from one to t' other. Well, one evening' I was to Sis-&#xD;
ter Bedott's-husband had gone ove~ to Mother Ma-&#xD;
gwire's. 'T was about a year afore Deacon Bedott&#xD;
died, and he wasn't very well-you know he was fee.&#xD;
.ble a number o' years afore his death. Well, he and&#xD;
Sister Silly and me was a setting' round the settin'-rooni&#xD;
fire, and Artemishy Pike-the Widder~N~e's oldest&#xD;
darter-she was a spending' the evening' the~e. Axte.&#xD;
mishy was jest a tellin' us about Deacon Whipple's&#xD;
comm' to thair house the day afore to take Cinthy&#xD;
(her youngest sister) to dew, 'cause he 'd heerd how 't&#xD;
she tendedd a ball when she was over to Yarmount a&#xD;
~isitin'; and Artemishy was in an awful fidgit about&#xD;

it,' for fear he 'd have her hauled up for 't, and she&#xD;
wanted Deacon Bedott to try to prevent it. Well, she&#xD;
was just a tellin' about it when ther come a knock to&#xD;
the door.' "Walk in," says Sister Bedott-.a~id who&#xD;
should walk in but Deacon Whipple, with Deacon&#xD;
Kenipe and Deacon Crosby on behind him I "There,"&#xD;
says I to Artemishy, "the Old One 's always at hand&#xD;
when you 're talking' about him." "Hush !" says she.&#xD;
"Lawful sakes I" says I; "I ain't afeard o' bein' haul.&#xD;
ed up-I dou't live here." When they come in, Ar.&#xD;
temishy looked half.skairt to death,~, She thought&#xD;
they 'd come to talk about dealing' with Cinthy, but Sis.&#xD;
ter Bedott whispered tew her, and says she, "Don't&#xD;
be afeard; I don't bleve it 's Cinthy. I guess more&#xD;
likely it 's Sue Collins." ('T was the same time they&#xD;
had her over the coals.) Whatever 't was, we all&#xD;
know'd 't was purty important bizuess, for Deacon&#xD;
Whipple lookt wonderful big and awful sollem: his&#xD;
face was about half a yard long. Bn.t though he tried&#xD;
to appear as if he' felt dretful bad, 't was plain 'to be&#xD;
seen he was enjoyin' a state of internal satisfaction-&#xD;
lookt jest as he always did when he got hold of a case&#xD;
that suite~ him to a T. But Deacon Kenipe and flea.&#xD;
con Crosb~y lookt as if they raly felt ,b~d. (They was&#xD;
very clever men indeed.) They didn't say a word, but&#xD;
Deacon Whipple he convarsed a spell about matters&#xD;
and things in general, said the weather was onconimon&#xD;
~z~e for the season o' year, crops were wonderfaJ&#xD;
&#xD;
DEACON WHIPPIJE.&#xD;
&#xD;
abundant, 'specially the apple crop-though 't was to&#xD;
be lamented that any o' the good critters o' Providence&#xD;
should be abused and turned to the ruination o' man-&#xD;
kind as apples was by bein' made into cider. Then.&#xD;
he went on to deplore the low state o' religion in the&#xD;
place, axed us wimn4n folks about the state of-our&#xD;
minds a~d so on, and then said they 'd come on pri-&#xD;
vate bigness and would like to see Deacon Bedott&#xD;
alone a spell. So we three wimmin got up and went&#xD;
into the kitchen. "Now," says Sister Bed ott, says&#xD;
she, "I feel ~ ff1 'd like to know what they 'ye come&#xD;
for-wouldent you ?" "Yes," says we. "Well,&#xD;
theiTi," says Silly, "let 's go into the buttery and listen."&#xD;
"Agreed," says we. So in we went. You see ther&#xD;
was a passage between the settin'.room and the kitch-&#xD;
en, and on one side o' this passage the buttery was ~t-&#xD;
tiwated; and ther was a do6r leading' from the buttery&#xD;
into the settin'-room, and atop o' this door ther was an&#xD;
awful 'wide crack, so 't a body could hear every word&#xD;
that was said in the settin'-room there. Well, in we&#xD;
goes~as still as mice. Artemishy and me we got up&#xD;
on an old box 'and peeped though the crack, and Sis-&#xD;
ter Bedott she put her e~r to the keyhole. Deacon&#xD;
Whipple had begun to talk afore we got fixed. The&#xD;
first thing I heerd him say, says he, "It 's very en-&#xD;
pleasant bizness, very indeed. I assure you it 's very&#xD;
tryin' to~y feelings to be necessiated to rebuke a bro.&#xD;
tlaer, but it seoms to be an insurmountable duLty in&#xD;

this case. We 'te all poor errin' critters; the best on&#xD;
us is liable to go astray and fail in our duty. I 'm free&#xD;
to ~confess that even I have my shorteomins "-I guess&#xD;
he had an attack on 't when he cut husband's panta-&#xD;
loons; they was so short and so tight he had to give&#xD;
'em to Jeff-~" I have my shoitcomins, and I feel to&#xD;
mourn for 't; I feel to lament that I 'm fra4uently&#xD;
cold and slack in dewin' my duty.-don't keep such a&#xD;
constant watch round the walls o' Zion as I 'd ought&#xD;
tew. I feel as if it may be owin' to my onfaithfulness&#xD;
Brother Bedott, that you 'ye fell into the practice o'&#xD;
such a hyneous offence-ahem " "Gosh!" says&#xD;
Deacon J3edott, says he-(now Deacon Bedott n~ver&#xD;
used bad language in his lifobut once in a while when&#xD;
lie was dretfully took by surprise he used to say&#xD;
"gosh !")-." Gosh," says he, "I want to know if you&#xD;
was a meaning' me all this time? Well, I 'd like to&#xD;
know what I've ben a dewin'?". "0 dear," says Sil-&#xD;
ly, says she, "it 's husband, it 's husband! What has&#xD;
he done-what has he done ?" "Don't make a fuss,"&#xD;
says I; "they 'II hear you, and we shall have to~clear&#xD;
out." Deacon Bedott went on; "I ain't aware o' bein'&#xD;
in the practice of any known sin. If I 'ye done&#xD;
wrongin any way I 'm willing' to be told on 't, and I hope&#xD;
I shall take your rebuke as I 'd ought tew-though as&#xD;
I said afore I ain't aware o' bein' in the practice of&#xD;
any hyn~ous offense, as you call it." Says Deacon&#xD;
Whipple, says he, with a rael provokin' grin, "I 'm&#xD;
4)&#xD;
&#xD;
'raly sorry you 're so dull of apprehension, Brother Be-&#xD;
dott. it 's truly lamentable, when a brother, that 's ben&#xD;
apparently a burning' and shining' light, turns out to be&#xD;
such a greevious transgresser-when sinners round is in&#xD;
such perishin' need o' havin' good examples sot afore&#xD;
'em, to make 'em cast down the weapons 0' rebellion.&#xD;
And it 's still woss, when such a backsliding' brother is&#xD;
reasoned with, to see him refuse to confess his faults,&#xD;
and repent of his sins and mend his ways.~~ "Dew&#xD;
tell me," says Deacon Bedott, says he, "what the sin&#xD;
is, and if I 'ye raly been guilty on 't, I'll repent, and&#xD;
confess, and forsake it tew." "I' m sorry to see you&#xD;
so obderre~t," says Deacon Whipple, says he. "You&#xD;
know, Scripter says, if a brother is overtook in a fault,&#xD;
the brother must go tew~ him and tell him on 't-~~-and&#xD;
if he refutses to, hear 'em, why, he must be dealt with&#xD;
afore the congregation;' and I 'm afeard that 's what&#xD;
you 'II have to come tew, Brother Bedott, if you hold&#xD;
out 50.'~ ~'O misery me!" says Silly, says she, "What&#xD;
has that man ben a dewin! what has he ben a dewin!&#xD;
0 dear me! what an onfortunit woman I be !" "Sil-&#xD;

my word for 't, he hadn't done nothin'-it '11 turn out,&#xD;
to be jest nothing' at, all, I'll bet a ~ooseso dew be&#xD;
easy." Well, arter Deacon Whipple had gone on so&#xD;
for ever~ so long, Deacon Bedott got clear out o'&#xD;
patience land says he, "For massy's s#e, what is it?&#xD;

&#xD;
't is." "I 'd rather not," says Deacon Kenipe, says he,&#xD;
"Brother Whipple begun, and he ought to finish."&#xD;
"I say so tew," says Deacon Crosby. "Why," saps&#xD;
Deacon Whipple, "it 's curus that Brother Bedott&#xD;
should be so onwillin' to own up,' without my comm'&#xD;
right out." "0! dear me, suz !" says Sister Bedott,&#xD;
"that he should be a cutting' capers, and me never sus-&#xD;
pect him on 't! 0 Melissy, I[ shall die / I shall die !"&#xD;
and she begun wringing' her hands like mad. "You&#xD;
simple critter," says I, "dew save yer highsteerics till&#xD;
there 's occasion for 'em; dew keep still, they '11 hear&#xD;
you, sartin sure, and if they should ketch us a listening ,&#xD;
't would ruin all our three repertations." On account&#xD;
o' Silly's interruption, we lost what Deacon ~W~hipple&#xD;
said. next-and the first 'lhing we heerd arter she got&#xD;
quiet agin, was Deacon Bedott sayin' "It 's curus you&#xD;
should be so willing' to believe such a story about me,&#xD;
when you 'ye know'd me some years, and hadn't never&#xD;
heerd nothing' o' the kind till now." "I for one wasn't&#xD;
willing" to believe it," says Deacon Kenipe; "nor I&#xD;
another " says Deacon Crosby, says7 h~. "Now, ther&#xD;
ain't no use in denying' on 't, Brother Bedott," says&#xD;
Deacon Whipple, says he-." A few years ago, 't wa'n't&#xD;
thought to be no great crime, to take a ~lass o' sperrits&#xD;
now and then; ther wa n light on the sub-&#xD;
ject as ther is now in these re temperance days ;- but,&#xD;
even then, 't was eny most an onheerd-of thing for&#xD;
auy body, ~o git intostioated on eider-as you're iii a&#xD;
&#xD;
habit o' dewin' now against light and privelidge-and&#xD;
you a deacon tevv-a man that makes such high pre..&#xD;
tensions. 0 Brother Bedott I it 's a hyneous and a&#xD;
cryin' sin." "Consarn it I" says Deacon Bedott, says&#xD;
he, "dew stop a minnit and let one speak; I want to&#xD;
know, who said I was in a habit o' takin' tew much."&#xD;
"Whoever 't was," says Silly, says she, "they lied,&#xD;
and They know'd it, and I '11 tell Deacon Whipple so-&#xD;
lemme come, Melissy." (lit always made Silly awful&#xD;
mad to have anybody else run the deacon down,&#xD;
though she used to give it tew him herself; like the&#xD;
dragon sometimes.) "Woman alive," says I, "what&#xD;
be you dewin! you shan't go out there-you '11 jest&#xD;
spile the hull-and we shan't hear another word-&#xD;
it '11 be time enough for you to put in bymeby." She&#xD;
made such a noise, they 'd a heerd her, if they hadent&#xD;
a got to talking' purty loud themselves. Well, she got&#xD;
still; and the next thing I heerd was Deacon Kenipe&#xD;
sayin', says he, "Brother Whipple, dew come to the&#xD;
pint; dew tell Brother Bedott, who 't was-and don't&#xD;
hurt his feelings any niore 'n you ~an help." "Well,&#xD;
then,~ says Deacon Whipple, says he, "'t was yer&#xD;
brother-in-law, Mr. Magwire." "Gracious sakes&#xD;
alive 1" says Deacon Bedott, says he, "did Josh say&#xD;
that about me? What on arth did the critter mean?"&#xD;
"He meant what he said, I s'pose," says Deacon&#xD;
Whipple, "that you 're in a habit o' gittin' corned on&#xD;

he 'd actilly seen~ me drunk on cider ?" "ile meant&#xD;
so, undoubtedly," says Deacon Whipple; "tho' them&#xD;
wasn't recipee&amp;amp; the words he used; he called to my&#xD;
shop to-day a purpose to tell me on 't, said 't was&#xD;
awful tryin' to his feeling, to be obleeged to expose&#xD;
you, not only on account o' your bein' a connection o'&#xD;
hisen, but 'cause he raly thought you was a worthy&#xD;

I hadn't no very high opinion o' Mr. Magwire, bein'&#xD;

that man will take it to heart, when he hears ther 's&#xD;

So IL goes over and tells Brother Kenipe and Brother&#xD;
Crosby on 'to They was very onwillin' to come over&#xD;

Bedott didn't say a word; he said afterward he&#xD;
thought he 'd let Brother Whipple go on, and see how&#xD;
much he would say. After a minnit Deacon Whipple&#xD;
begun agin' and says he, "Dew you still continue to&#xD;
deny it?" Deacon Bedott never opened his head.&#xD;
"Well," says Deacon Whipple, says he, "silence gives&#xD;
consent; so, I s'pose you don't mean to hold out no&#xD;
longer, and say 't ain't a factc Well 't ain't tew late to&#xD;

into the setting' room; audi ther was such a general&#xD;
roaring' and laffin' as I never heerd afore nor sence.&#xD;

o' the commotion and slipt out. But though Deacon&#xD;
Bedott tried to look sober, and told husband 't was tew&#xD;

for the welfare o' Ziom; he never made another com-&#xD;
plaint agiust nobody while he lived there; and about&#xD;
six months afterward, he moved away from Wiggle-&#xD;
town.                                                                    XXIX.&#xD;
UR. John Darling, a worthy and intelligent me-&#xD;
chanic, who lias been, for two years past, a resi.&#xD;
dent of our town, was somewhat surprised and consid-&#xD;
erably gratified one day last fall, at receiving an invi-&#xD;
tation to dine with Colonel Phulpot, one of the aristoc-&#xD;
Mr. Darling enjoys that respect in our community&#xD;
which mechanical ingenuity and integrity united are&#xD;
always sure t&amp;amp; command every where. These quali-&#xD;
ties, and a more than ordinary degree of information,&#xD;
acquired by the employment of much of his leisure&#xD;
time in reading, ~ave given him an almost unbounded&#xD;
influence among his own class.&#xD;
Though the invitation to Colonel P.'s created some&#xD;
surprise in his mind, he felt more disposed to be pleas.&#xD;
ed at the honor than to question the motives which&#xD;
prompted it; for his nature is wholly free from sus-&#xD;
picion and the petty feeling of jealousy which those in&#xD;
his station sometirne8 indulge toward the "upper ten"&#xD;

--feelings with which, we are sorry to say, the bosom&#xD;
of his better half was frequently agitated..&#xD;
"We have been neighbors for some time, Mr. Dar-&#xD;
'ling," said Colonel Philpot; "it is time we were better&#xD;
acquainted. You. must come and dine socially with&#xD;
me to-morrow. Mrs. Philpot and the children are out&#xD;
of town, and I am going to have a few friends to en~&#xD;
liven my solitude."&#xD;
'So John Darling "saved his appetite," dressed him.&#xD;
self in his best clothes, and, at the appointed hour--a&#xD;
somewhat later one than his customary time for dining&#xD;
--repaired to Colonel Philp@t's.&#xD;
He met there several of his associates---had a "fine&#xD;
time and a grand dinner "-the utmost hilarity and&#xD;
good feeling prevailed; and Mr. Darling entertained*&#xD;
his wife with an account of it at every meal for sever-&#xD;
al weeks.&#xD;
"Hester," said he one day, as they were seated at a&#xD;
codfish dinner, "did you ever taste a potato pud-&#xD;
ding?"&#xD;
"Potato pudding! No; I never heerd of such a&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"Well, I wish you could, for 't is delicious! We&#xD;
had one when I dined at Colonel Philpot's."&#xD;
"I wonder what you dccI n't have at Colonel Phil-&#xD;
pot's," said Mrs. Darling. "I declare, I 'ni. tired hear.&#xD;
ing about it."&#xD;
"Well, I 'II tell you one'thing we did n't have-.we&#xD;

dk~'t have codfish. But, that pudding--ZI wish you'd&#xD;
learn how to make it; it was superb!",&#xD;
"I presume so; and I guess, if I had half a dozen&#xD;
servants at my heels, and a thorough-trained cook into&#xD;
the 'bargain, I could have things superb, too. But, as&#xD;
long as I have every thing to do myself and very&#xD;
little to do wzth, I don't see how I 'm to get up things&#xD;
in style. I wonder you can expect me to."&#xD;
"I don't expect you to, Hester. You always do&#xD;
things to suit my taste. But that pudding was excel.&#xD;
lent; and, being made of potatoes, I thought, of course&#xD;
it must be economical, and~-."&#xD;
"Economical! That 's all you know about it.&#xD;
What gumps men are!' I '11 warrant it had forty dif~&#xD;
fervent things in it; and legs' potatoes than any thing&#xD;
else. I 'm no hand to fuss up. I like plain cookery,&#xD;
for my part."&#xD;
"So dol, asa general thing. But then, you know,&#xD;
it '5 well to have something a little better than ordina.&#xD;
ry once in a while."&#xD;
"Well, if' you 're not satisfied with my way of&#xD;
doing things, you must hire a cook, or go and board&#xD;
out." And Mrs. Darling put on her ii~jure4 1ooA~, and&#xD;
remained silent during the rest of, the dinner.&#xD;
But, after all, she was not an ill-natured woman&#xD;
really; ai~cl, after her husband had gone to his shop,&#xD;
she began to feal a little pricked in her conscience for&#xD;
having been so cross at dinner. She wished she had&#xD;

not gone on at such a rate. But, then, John had bored&#xD;
her so about that dinner at Colonel Philpot~s, she was&#xD;
out of patience with it. Yet what right had she to be&#xD;
out of patience with John? He never was out of pa-&#xD;
tience, with her, and she could but acknowledge that&#xD;
he often had reason to be so. So she resolved to make&#xD;
it u~ as soon as possible.&#xD;
"John," said she, as she handed him a cup of tea,&#xD;
I 'ye a great notion to try that potato pudding. I&#xD;
believe I could make one."&#xD;
"No doubt of it, Hester," said her husband; "you&#xD;
can do almost any thing you try to."&#xD;
"II suppose it takes butter, and su~a; and eggs, and&#xD;
spices, and so forth; but I wish I knew the propor-&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
"It's very easy to find out all about it by calling at&#xD;
Colonel ?hilpot's. He said his wife would be delight-&#xD;
ed ~o get acquainted with you."&#xD;
"So you 'ye told me a dozen times; but I think&#xD;
that, if she wanted to get acquainted with me, she&#xD;
might call upon me. She 's lived here longer than I&#xD;
have, and it is n't my place to call first; and I don't&#xD;
believe the colonel tells the truth when he says she&#xD;
wants to get acquainted with me.~'&#xD;
Well, I always think people mean as they say,&#xD;
and I wish you would, too, Hester."&#xD;
"But it 's very evident that she holds herself a great&#xD;
deal above me. She has no reason to, certainly, for&#xD;

her family was n't half as respectable as mine. Mrs.&#xD;
David Potter knows all about them, root and branch,&#xD;
and she says that Mrs. Philpot's father kept a very low&#xD;
tavern in Norridge, and Mrs. Philpot herself tended&#xD;
the bar when she was a girl. But, somehow, Colonel&#xD;
Philpot happened to fall in love with her, and he sent&#xD;
her away to school, and then niarried her."&#xD;
"Well, that 's nothing ~ainst her, is it ?"&#xD;
"No, of course it would n't be, if she didn't carry&#xD;
her head so high now. But it 's always the way with&#xD;
such persons-th~y ndver know how to bear prosper&#xD;
ity. There would n't be any thing said about her ori-&#xD;
gin, if she did n't put on such airs; but, as long as&#xD;
'7&#xD;
she feels so lifted up, folks ~will tcdk you know.&#xD;
"Perhaps you don't do her justice, Hester. You&#xD;
know nothing about iier excepting what you 'ye heard.&#xD;
At~any rate, it would do no harm, to call upon her."&#xD;
After repeated conversations and discussions of this&#xD;
sort, Mrs. Darling concluded to pay Mrs. Philpot a&#xD;
visit. She could make the potato pudding an excuse,&#xD;
and be governed by Mrs. P.'s reception in regard to&#xD;
further intercourse. Mrs. Philpot has been, for sever-&#xD;
al years past, to use her o'~Vn expression, "very unfor.&#xD;
tunate in her domestics." With the exception of her&#xD;
cook.'-up to the time of Mrs. Darling's call-she had&#xD;
seldom knpt one above a month, and sometimes not as&#xD;
long as that, This frequent change of servants was,&#xD;
not so much owing to any unkindness on Mrs. Phil-&#xD;

pot's part, as to the fact that Mrs. Mudlaw, her cook&#xD;
could never agree with them. This functionary had&#xD;
been~ for several years, a fixture in Colonel P.'s estab-&#xD;
lishment; indeed, Mrs. P. declared she could not pos-&#xD;
sibly get along without her. Mrs. Mudlaw was in&#xD;
fact, a good cook, and so entirely relieved that lady&#xD;
from all care in that department that, rather than part&#xD;
with her, she was willing to submit to her petty t~r-&#xD;
anny in every thing. The cook actually "ruled the&#xD;
roast" at Colonel P.'s in more than one sense. And&#xD;
she did' not. often find the subalterns of the h.use-&#xD;
hold as submissive to her wishes as Mrs. Philpot her-&#xD;
self was. She contrived to quarrel them away in a&#xD;
short time, for she had only to say to Mrs. P., "Well,&#xD;
either Bridget or I must quit, so you may take your&#xD;
choice ;" and the offending servant-maid was dismissed&#xD;
forthwith, there being no appeal from Mrs. Mudlaw's&#xD;
decision.&#xD;
A. scene of this kind had just occurred when Mrs.&#xD;
Darling made her visit, and a new raw Irish girl had&#xD;
that morning been installed in place ~of the one dis-&#xD;
charged. The duty of this girl was to answer the&#xD;
door-bell, and help Mrs. Mudlaw. In fact, the hard-&#xD;
est and most disagreeable of the kitchen-worJc came&#xD;
upon her. When Mrs. Darling rang, Mrs. Philpot&#xD;
was in the kitchen giving instructions to Peggy, or&#xD;
rather acquiescing in those which Mrs. Mudlaw was&#xD;
laying down.&#xD;
&#xD;
RECIPE FOR POTATO PUD])ING. 365&#xD;
"There goes the bell," said that important person-&#xD;
age,'and AIrs. Philpot hastened to an upper window to&#xD;
~ee who it was. Having satisfied herself; she came&#xD;
back and toll Peggy to go and admit the lady./&#xD;
"Why don't you start, you?" said Mrs. Mudlaw.&#xD;
"Well, what '11 I do now ?" said Peggy, whirling&#xD;
round in that bewildered wa~r peculiar to Irish girls.&#xD;
"Do U' roared Mudlaw. "Don't you know nothing ?&#xD;
Hain't we jest been tellin' ye 't was your duty to tend&#xD;
to the door-bell? Run to the front door and let 'em&#xD;
in, and show 'em into the drawin'-room. You know&#xD;
w~ere that is, don't you ?"&#xD;
"Faith, I know that," answered Peggy, and away&#xD;
she ran, thanking her stars that there was at least one&#xD;
thing that she knew.&#xD;
"It 's no one that I know, I 'm pure," said Mrs.&#xD;
Philpot, after Peggy had gone; "at least the bonnet&#xD;
and shawl are not familiar to me. I presume it is&#xD;
somebody I don't care about seeing."&#xD;
"I should ~i't wonder," said Mudlaw. "But I&#xD;
s'pose you could n't do otherways, as the curnel has&#xD;
given orders that nobody ain't to be refused till after&#xD;
With much confusion and toe-stubbling, the unfor-&#xD;
tunate Peggy ushered Mrs. Darling into the nursery,&#xD;
which w~s also Mrs. Philp6t's ordinary sitting-room.&#xD;
It was directly over the kitchen, and heated by the&#xD;
cooking stove by the means of a drum, or dummy, as&#xD;

Mrs. Mudlaw called it. Every word that was said in&#xD;
the kitchen could easily be heard in the nurs~y-.....&#xD;
quite a convenience to Miidlaw, as it enabled her often&#xD;
to comftiunicate with Mrs. Philpot without the trouble&#xD;
of going up st-airs. Many an interesting account of&#xD;
what sh~ did when Mr. Mudlaw was living, and how&#xD;
they managed at General K.'s when she wa~ stcqfing&#xD;
there, has gone up that stove-pipe.&#xD;
The nursery was in a state of the greatest disorder~&#xD;
as was usually the case, though the children were all&#xD;
out just then. Sukey the nurse-girl, had taken the&#xD;
baby out to ride, and Philip Augustus had gone with&#xD;
them; and Zoe Matilda was at school. Playthings of&#xD;
every description, carts, horses, dolls, as well as chil-&#xD;
dren's books and clothes, were scattered about the room&#xD;
in what Mrs. Darling called "awful confusion." But&#xD;
she had not time for inward comments upon this state&#xD;
of things, before her attention was called to the con-&#xD;
versation below.&#xD;
"ft 's Mrs. Darling as wishes to see you&#xD;
said Peggy.&#xD;
"That Mrs. Darling! Did you ever I" exclaimed&#xD;
Mrs. Philpot.&#xD;
"She ain7t nobody, is she ?" said Mrs. Mudlaw.&#xD;
"Nobody at all. Her husband is a cabinet-maker;&#xD;
but the colonel has charged it upon me to be polite to&#xD;
her jest now. He wished me to call upon her ; but I&#xD;
would n't condescend to. stoop so low as that, though&#xD;

he made me promise to treat her with attention if she&#xD;
called."&#xD;
"Well, I wouldn't do it, if I was you," said the&#xD;
cook. "I 'd be mistress ini'ny own house any how."&#xD;
"II3ut, you know, it '~ for his interest now.&#xD;
says that Darling has a great deal of influence among&#xD;
mechanics-can command a good many votes."&#xD;
"Oh, I remember now I he 's one of them codgers&#xD;
that dined here while you was aw~y, that the curnel&#xD;
was a laughing' about afterward, and telling you how&#xD;
awkward they handled the silver forks."&#xD;
"Yes; is n't it provoking to have to be polite to&#xD;
such people? Well, I shall be glad when electionn 's&#xD;
over, for the colonel says I may cut them all then,&#xD;
and I think it won't be long before they sink back to&#xD;
their own level." And Mrs. Philpot arose with a sigh,&#xD;
and ascended to the drawing-room, arranging her&#xD;
features into a gracious and patronizing expression as&#xD;
she went.&#xD;
Mrs. Darling's feelings during this conversation&#xD;
"can be better imagined than described," as the novels&#xD;
would say. Her first impulse was to leave the house&#xD;
without waiting for Mrs. Philpot's appearance, and she&#xD;
rose and made a few steps with that intention; but,&#xD;
on second thoughts, she resolved to remain, and let&#xD;
her know that she only came bn an errand, and re-&#xD;
sumed her seat.&#xD;

room she returned to the kitchen, supposing that her&#xD;
visitor had gone.&#xD;
"She 's gone," said she, "without waiting for me.&#xD;
She does n't know enough about good society to un-&#xD;
derstand that a lady does n't make her appearance the&#xD;
moment she 's called for."&#xD;
"I should n't wonder if she was in the nursery all&#xD;
the time," said Mudlaw; "for I heard a stepping up&#xD;
there a while ago, and the children hadn't got home&#xD;
yet. Where did you take her to, you ?"&#xD;
"Why, I tuck her in the dhrawin'-roona, sure, as&#xD;
you tould me, right overbid," said Peggy, in some&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
"You blunderin' Irish gumphead! Don't you&#xD;
know the drawin'.room from the nursery ?"&#xD;
"Och! but I thought it was the dhrawin'-room;&#xD;
for didn't I see the young master a dhra~vin' his cart,&#xD;
and was n't Shukey a dhrawin' the baby about the&#xD;
floor by its feet, when I went up to take the water&#xD;
this morning? "&#xD;
"There, I told you she was a born fool I" said Mud.&#xD;
law, in a rage. "She 'II nevei know nothing-.-..she 'II&#xD;
never learn nothing-.you may as well send her off&#xD;
first as last."&#xD;
"Hush! don't speak so loud," said Mrs. Philpot, in&#xD;
a whisper. "She can hear all you say-she has heard&#xD;
encaigh already. Dear me, what shall I do? The&#xD;
colonel will be ~o provoked! How could you be so&#xD;
&#xD;
dumb, Peggy? Run Tight up and take her into the&#xD;
drawing-room. Stop I you need n't; you will make&#xD;
some other mistake. I'll go myself."&#xD;
In a state of mind not to be envied, Mrs. Philpot&#xD;
hastened to the nursery. But as she entertained a&#xD;
faint hope that the conversation below had not pene-&#xD;
trated through Mrs. Darling's bonnet, she endeav9red&#xD;
to hide her embarrassment under an affable smile, ex-&#xD;
tended her hand gracefully, and drawled out a genteel&#xD;
welcome to her visitor.&#xD;
"Delighted to see you, Mrs. Darling; hut very&#xD;
sorry you should have been brought into the nursery"&#xD;
--no wonder she 's sorry, thought Mrs. IDarling-&#xD;
"these raw Irish girls are so stupid I Walk into the&#xD;
parlor, if you please."&#xD;
"No, I thank you, Mrs. Philpot, I 'd as soon sit&#xD;
here," returned Mrs. Dai~ling. "I can only stay a&#xD;
moment. I called to a~k for a recipe for pqtato pud-&#xD;
ding. Mr. Darling tasted one when he dined, with&#xD;
Colonel Philpot, and lik~d it s~o much that he wished&#xD;
me to get directions for making it."&#xD;
"Potato ptidding? Ah, yes, I recollect. Mudlaw,&#xD;
my cook, ~does make a very good plain thing that she&#xD;
calls a potato pudding; but I know nothing about her&#xD;
manner of preparing it. I will call her, however, and&#xD;
she shall tell you herself." Thereupon she pulled the&#xD;

"Send Mudlaw here," said Mrs. Philpot.&#xD;
She would not have dared to address her "chief&#xD;
cook-and bottle-washer" without the respectful title of~&#xD;
.A&amp;amp;s.; but it was rather more grand to omit it, and she&#xD;
always did so when not in her hearing.&#xD;
"The fnissus said I w~as to send you there," said&#xD;
Peggy.&#xD;
"You send me I" exclaimed the indignant cook.&#xD;
"I guess when ii go for your sending, it '11 be after&#xD;
this."&#xD;
Mrs. Philpot, although conversing in a condescend.&#xD;
ing manner with Mrs.Darling. caught something. of the&#xD;
cook's reply to her summons, and asked to be excused&#xD;
for a moment, saying that Peggy was so stupid, she&#xD;
feared that Mudlaw might not understand her, and&#xD;
she ~would go herself and send her. So she hastened&#xD;
down to the kitchen, where she found the head func-&#xD;
tionary standing on her dignity.&#xD;
"Pretty well," said she, "if I am to be ordered&#xD;
round by an Irish scullion I"&#xD;

said Mrs. Philpot meekly, Opening the door of an ad-&#xD;

request, and with a stern aspect, entered the roora&#xD;
with Mrs, Philpot. The latter closed the door for fear&#xD;
of being heard overhead, and began-~--&#xD;
"What do you think, Mrs. Mndlaw? That Mrs.&#xD;

"I sha'n't do it. I make it a point never to give&#xD;
my recipes to nobody."&#xD;
"I know it; and, I 'm sure I don't blame you.&#xD;
But, in this case-just now-I really don't see how&#xD;
we can refuse."&#xD;
"Well, I sha'n't do it, and that 's the hull on&#xD;

"But he needent know it, need he ?"&#xD;
He certainly will find it out by some means. I&#xD;

it if election was over; and now 't is very important&#xD;
-it may save us ~121 trouble. The colonel is so de-&#xD;
cided you know."&#xD;
The~e last words of Mrs. Philpot had an effect&#xD;
upon Mudlaw which no wish or ~entreaty of that lady&#xD;
would have ever produced, for they suggested to ~her&#xD;
semsh mind the possibility of a dismissal from her&#xD;
snug birth ~at Colonel P.'s, where she canned it with a&#xD;

merous orders to Peggy, and followed. She was a&#xD;
short, fat woman, with a broad red face-such a per.&#xD;
son as a stranger would call the very personification&#xD;
of good nature; ,though I have never found fat people&#xD;
to be any more amiable than lean ones. Certainly,&#xD;
Mrs. Mudlaw was not a very sweet tempered woman.&#xD;
On this occasion, she felt rather more cross than usual,&#xD;
forced, as she was, to give one of her recipes to a no-&#xD;
body. She, however, knew the necessity of assuming&#xD;
a pleasant demeanor at that time, and accordingly en.&#xD;
tered the -&#xD;
Ziursery with an encouraging grin on her&#xD;
blazing countenance. Mrs. PhilpQt, fearing lest her&#xD;
cook's familiarity might belittle her mistress in the&#xD;
,eyes of Mrs. Darling, and again asking to be excused&#xD;
for a short time, went into the library, a nondescript&#xD;
appartrnent, dignified by that name, which ~communi-&#xD;

"Yes," replied Mrs. Darling. "I would be obliged&#xD;
to you for the directions." And she took out of her&#xD;
pocket a pencil and paper to write it down.&#xD;
"Well, 't is an excellent pudding, " said Mudlaw,&#xD;

one, why, then I don't take as many. As quick as&#xD;

lar to have my butter fresh and sweet, Some folks&#xD;
think it 's no matter what sort o' butter they use for&#xD;
cooking , but.Idon't. Of all things, I do despise strong&#xD;
frowy, rancid bi~tter. For pity's sake have your but-&#xD;
~ter fresh."&#xD;
"How mu9h butter, did you say ?"&#xD;
"Wal, that depends, as I said before, on what sized&#xD;
pudding' you want to make. And another thing that&#xD;
regulates the quality of butter 'I use is the 'mount o'&#xD;
cream I take. I always put in more or less cream;&#xD;
when I have abundance o' cream, I put in considerable&#xD;
and when it 's scarce, why, I use more butter than I&#xD;
otherways should. But you must be particular not to&#xD;
get in too much cream. There 's a great deal in hay-&#xD;
in' jest the right quantity; and so 'tis with all the in-&#xD;
grejiences. There ain't a better puddin' in the world&#xD;

RECIPE FOR POTATO PUDDING. 375&#xD;
I lived in Tuckertown, I was a visiting' to Squire Hum-&#xD;
prey's one time-I went in the flrst company in Tuck-&#xD;
ertown-dear me! this is a changeable world. Wal,&#xD;
they had what they called a potato pudding' for dinner,&#xD;
Good land! Of' all the pucidins! I 'ye often occur-&#xD;
ed to that* pudding' since, and wondered what the&#xD;
Squire's wife was a thinking' of. when she'made it. I&#xD;
wa 'n t obleeged to do no such things in them days,&#xD;
and didep.t know how to do any thing as well as I do&#xD;
now. Necessity 's the mother of invention. Experi-&#xD;
ence is the best teacher, after all-"&#xD;
"Do you sweeten it ?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes, to be sure it needs sugar, the best o'&#xD;
sugar, too; not this wet, soggy, brown sugar. Some&#xD;
klks never think o' usin' good sugar to cook with, but&#xD;
- for my part I won't have no other."&#xD;
"How much sugar do you take ?"&#xD;
"Wal, that depends altogether on whether you cal'&#xD;
culate to have sass for it-some like sass, you know,&#xD;
and then some agin don't. So, when I calculate for&#xD;
sass, I don't take so much sugar; and when I don 't&#xD;
calculate for sass,. I make it sweet enough to ,eat with-&#xD;
out sass. Poor Mr. Mudlaw was a great hand for&#xD;
puddin'sass. I always made it for hixn-good, rich&#xD;
sass too. I could afford to have things rich before he&#xD;
was utifortinate in bizness." (Mucilaw went to State's&#xD;
prison for hor~e-steallng.) "I like sass myself; too;&#xD;
and the cu.rnel and the children are all great sass&#xD;

&#xD;
hands; and so I generally calculate for sas4hough&#xD;
Miss Philpot prefers the puddiu' without sass, and per..&#xD;
haps you 'd prefer it without. If so you must put in&#xD;
sugar accordingly. I always mal~e it a pint to have&#xD;
em sweet enough when they 're to be eat without&#xD;
sass."&#xD;
"And don't you use eggs ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, eggs is one o' the principal ingreji.&#xD;
ences."&#xD;
"How many does it require ?"&#xD;
"Wal, when eggs is plenty, I always use plenty;&#xD;
and when they 're scarce, why I can do with less,&#xD;
though I 'd rather have enough; and be sure and beat&#xD;
'em well. It does distress me, th? way some folks&#xD;
beat eggs. I always want to have 'em thoroughly&#xD;
beat for every thing I use 'em in. It tries my patience&#xD;
most awfully to have any body round me that won't&#xD;
beat eggs enough. A spell ago we had a darkey to&#xD;
help in the kitchen. One day I was a makin' sponge&#xD;
cake, and havin' occasion to go up stairs after some*&#xD;
thing, I sot her to beating' the eggs. Wa], what do&#xD;
you think the critter done? Why, she whisked 'em&#xD;
round a few times, and turned 'em right onto the&#xD;
other ingrejiences~that I 'd got weighed out. When I&#xD;
come back and saw what she 'd done, my gracious! I&#xD;
came as nigh to losin' my temper as I ever allow my-&#xD;
self to come. 'T was awful provokin' I I always&#xD;
~v'aut the ~itohen help to do things as I warLt to hav~o&#xD;
&#xD;
RECIPE FOIL POTATO PUDDING. 877&#xD;
'em done. But I never saw a darkey yet that ever&#xD;
done any thing right. They 're a lazy slaughtering'&#xD;
set. To think o' her spilin' that cake so, when I 'd.&#xD;
told her over and over agin that I always made it a&#xD;
pint to have my eggs thoroughly beat !"&#xD;
"Yes, it was too bad. Do you use fruit in the pud.&#xD;
ding?"&#xD;
"Wal, that 's jest as~ you please. You 'd better be&#xD;
governed by your own judgment as to that. Some&#xD;
like currants and some like raisins, and then agin some&#xD;
d6n't like nary one. If you use raisins, for pity's&#xD;
sake pick out the stuns. It 's awful to have a body's&#xD;
teeth come grinding' onto a raisin stun. I 'd rather&#xD;
have my ears boxt any time."&#xD;
"How many raisins must I take ?"&#xD;
"Wal not too many.-it '5 apt to make the pudding'&#xD;
heavy, you know; and when it 's heavy it ain't so&#xD;
light and good. I 'm a great hand~-"&#xD;
"Yes, what do you use for flavoring ?"&#xD;
"There agin you '11 have to exercise your own&#xD;
judgment. Some likes one thing, and some another&#xD;
you know. If you. go the whole bigger on temperance,&#xD;
why some other kind o' flavyrin' 'II do as well as wine&#xD;
or brandy, I s'pose. But whatever you make up your&#xD;
mind to use, be particular to git in a sufficiency, or&#xD;
else your pudding' '11 be flat. II always make it a&#xD;
pint--~"&#xD;
"How ~ong must it bake?"&#xD;

"There 's the great thing after all. The baking's the&#xD;
main pint. A potter puddin', of all puddins, has got&#xD;
to be baked jest right. For if it bakes a leetle too&#xD;
much, it 's apt to dry it up; and then agin if it don't&#xD;
bake quite enough, it 's sure to taste potatery-and&#xD;
that piles it, you know."&#xD;
"How long should you think ?"&#xD;
"Wal, that depends a good deal on the heat o' your&#xD;
oven. If you have a very hot oven, 't won't do 4o&#xD;
leave it in too long; and if your oven ain't so very&#xD;
hot, why, you 'II be necessiated to leave it in longer."&#xD;
"Well, how can I tell any thing about it ?"&#xD;
"Well, I always let them bake till I think they 're&#xD;
done-that 's the safest way. I make it a pint to have&#xD;
'em baked exactly right. It 's very important in all&#xD;
kinds o' bakin'-cake, pies, bread, puddings, and&#xD;
every thing-to have 'em baked prec~se1y long enough&#xD;
and jest right. Some folks don't seem to have no sys-&#xD;
tem at all about their bakin'. One time they '11 burn&#xD;
their bread to a crisp, and then agin it '11 be so slack&#xD;
- 't ain't fit I~o eat. Nothing' hurts my feelings so much&#xD;
as to see things overdone or slack-baked. Here only&#xD;
t' other day, Lorry, the girl that Miss Philpot dis-&#xD;
missed yesterday, come within an ace o' letting my&#xD;
bread burn up. My back was turned for a minnit,&#xD;
a~id what should she do but go to stuffing' wood into the&#xD;
stove at the awfullest rate? If I hadent a found it&#xD;

about as much decomposed as I ever alloW myself to&#xD;
git'!. I told Miss Philpqt I wouldent stan' it no longer&#xD;
-one of us must quit-either Lorry or me must&#xD;
walk."&#xD;
"So you 'ye no rule about baking this pudding ?"&#xD;
"No rule I" said Mudlaw, with a look of intense&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
"Yes," said Mrs. ]2~arlin~g, "you seem to have no&#xD;
rule for any thing about it."&#xD;
"No rule 1" screamed the indignant cook, starting&#xD;
up, while her red face grew ten times redder, and her&#xD;
little black eyes snapped with rage. "No rules 1" and&#xD;
she planted herself in front of Mrs. Darling, erecting&#xD;
her fleshy figure to its full hight of majestic dumpi-&#xD;
ness, and extending the forefinger of her right hand&#xD;
tili it reached an alarming propinquity t~o that lady's'&#xD;
nose. "No rules! do you tell me I've no rules! Me!&#xD;
that 's cooked in the first families for fifteen years, and&#xD;
always gi'n satisfaction, to be told by such as you that&#xD;
I ain'tt no rule&amp;amp;!" -&#xD;
Thus far had Mudlaw proc,~6ded, and I know not&#xD;
to what length she would ha " slowed herself" to&#xD;
go, had not the sudden entrance of Colonel Philpot&#xD;
interrupted her. He being a persq~ of whom she&#xD;
stood somewhat in awe, particularly "jest at this t~ime,"&#xD;
she broke off in the midst of her tirade, and, casting a&#xD;
look of ineffable disgust at Mrs. Darling, retreated to&#xD;

her own dominions to vent her fury upon poor Peggy,&#xD;
who had done every thing wrong during her ab.&#xD;
sence.&#xD;
While Colonel Philpot was expressing his extreme&#xD;
satisfaction at seeing Mrs. Darling, Mrs. Philpot&#xD;
emerged from the library, where she had been shak-&#xD;
ing in her shoes during the interview between that&#xD;
lady and Mudlaw.&#xD;
"Matilda, my dear," said the colonel, "this is quite&#xD;
an unexpected pleasure, for really Mrs. Darling, we&#xD;
began to fear that you did not intend to cultivate&#xD;
us."&#xD;
"I did not come for that purpose," replied Mrs. Dar-&#xD;
ling, who, now that she saw through Colonel. Philpot,&#xD;
despised him thoroughly, and was not afraid to let&#xD;
him know it, notwithstanding he belonged to ~the aris-,&#xD;
tocracy of our town. "I came on an errand; and&#xD;
your cook has got very angry with me for some reason,&#xD;
I scarcely know what."&#xD;
"Poor Mudlaw," said Mrs. Philpot, anxious to&#xD;
screen her main stay from the ,colonel's displeasure,&#xD;
yet feeling the necessity of some apology to Mrs. Dar-&#xD;
ling. "Poor Mudlaw! II don't think she intended to&#xD;
be rude"'&#xD;
"What! has the cook been rude to Mrs. Darling ?"&#xD;
exclaimed Colonel Philpot.&#xD;
"Not rude, exactly, dear; but you know she is so&#xD;
sensitive about every thing connected with. her depart-&#xD;

ment, and site fancied that Mrs. Darling called her&#xD;
skill into question, and became somewhat excited."&#xD;
"Quite excited, I should call it," said Mrs. D. with&#xD;
a smile.&#xD;
"And she has dared to treat Mrs. Darling rudely~"&#xD;
said Colonel P., apparently much agitated. "Shame.&#xD;
ful! disgraceful! the wretch shall suffer for. it! To&#xD;
think that a,~ lady like Mrs. Darling should be insulted&#xD;
by a cook! in my house, too 1"&#xD;
"And just before election, too; it is a pity 1" said&#xD;
Mrs. Darling quietly, as she rose, and wishing them&#xD;
good-morning, departed, leaving Colonel Philpot lost&#xD;
in astonishment. Her last remark rendered necessary&#xD;
some explanation from Mrs. P. She was compelled&#xD;
to 'repeat some part of the conversation that had takQn&#xD;
place in the kitchen, which, though softened down as&#xD;
much as possible, was sufficient to rouse the. colonel's&#xD;
indignation to the highest pitch, for he saw at once&#xD;
that Darling was lost. He gave his silly wife a hearty&#xD;
blowing up, but upon Mudlaw, his wrath fell heaviest.&#xD;
No entreaties of her mistress could save her; she was&#xD;
commanded to quit th~ premises, to troop forthwith&amp;amp;&#xD;
"for being rude to visitors." But Mudlaw knew well&#xD;
enough the real reason of her dismissal, and when&#xD;
she went forth in stage and sorrow, she found' some&#xD;
~onsolation~in spreading it far and wide, thereby ma2k~&#xD;
ing Colonef Philpot very ridiculous in the eyes of the&#xD;
community.&#xD;

"Well, I 'm surprised, Hester" said John Darling,&#xD;
after his wife had given him a circumstantial account,&#xD;
of her visit "And I 'in right sorry, too, to have my&#xD;
good opinion of a man knocked in the head ~o, for I&#xD;
did think well of Col. IPhilpot. I really believed we&#xD;
couldn't send a better man to Congress. But it won't&#xD;
do. A man that can stoop to such conduct is n't fit&#xD;
to go there. I can't vote for him, and my influence,&#xD;
what little I ha~re, must go against him. If he gets&#xD;
there, it must be without any help from John Dar-&#xD;
ling."&#xD;
Colonel Philpot did itot go to Congress, and what&#xD;
made hi~ defeat the more aggravating was the fact that&#xD;
his opponent was elected by' the small majority of&#xD;
three votes. And so Colonel Philpot lost bi~ elec-&#xD;
lion; and Mrs. Philpot lost her cook; and Mr. Darling&#xD;
lost his esteem for Colonel Philpot, and all through&#xD;
the over-politeness of th9 latter.&#xD;
And was there nothing gained? Oh, yes; Mrs.&#xD;
Darling gained something. Kot much information in&#xD;
regard to the potato pudding, certainly; but she&#xD;
gained some knowledge of the internal arrangements&#xD;
of Mrs. Philpot's household, which proved of great&#xD;
service~to her, for she confesses to John that she was&#xD;
never so contented with her own home and her own&#xD;
husband as sh&amp;amp; has been since sbe made that memora-&#xD;

as my two hands-it was blue, too, and you know&#xD;
she is so dark."&#xD;

"I should thinl~ it would be unbecoming to her~-&#xD;
but Mary cares very little for dress, I think."&#xD;
"She does so-an unpardonable fault in a young&#xD;
lady, in my opinion. Mr. Shaw thinks a young lady&#xD;
should be always neatly and becomingly dressed. lie&#xD;

might be ever so well dressed and she would n't look&#xD;

does admire a fine form in a 'lady excessively.' But&#xD;
Mary 's so busy writing those nonsensical stories and&#xD;
stmff that she has no time to think of her personal ape&#xD;
appearance. Did you ever read' any thing so fiat?&#xD;
What a pity that she so mistakes her talent. Mr.&#xD;
Shaw laughs about it-he does dislike a blue stocking&#xD;
excessively. And, Caroline, don't you think Mary is&#xD;
very unrefinQd in her conversation ?"&#xD;
"I think she 's rather abrupt, sometimes.&#xD;
"Abrupt! my stars! I tell Mr. Shaw that what she&#xD;
intends for wit, I call essential vulgarity; and Mr.&#xD;

Mr. Shaw I should be so delighted if I could get along&#xD;
&#xD;
without servants-they are such a plague I but situated&#xD;
as we are, it would be utterly impossible. The girls&#xD;
are very industrious-I 'ye instructed them in that re.&#xD;
spect-but they are away so much; our relatives in&#xD;
the city insist upon having one of them there most~ of&#xD;
the time; and my health is so precarious that I can&#xD;
do very little. And then, when the girls are at home,&#xD;
they are necessarily so much occupied with their com-&#xD;
pany and music. Your daughters are not musicians,&#xD;
I believe, Mrs. More ?"&#xD;
"No-they have never shown any fondness for ~&#xD;
music-at least no decided talent for it; and their&#xD;

"Yes-.-they can't play on the piano. I had them&#xD;
learn to cut and fit of Miss Curtis, before she went&#xD;
away-and ever'since the have made all our dresses."&#xD;
"My stars! If that is n't a grand idea. You are&#xD;
such a capital manager, Mrs. More. Mr. Shaw often&#xD;
remarks that Dr. More's family is a model for its ad.&#xD;
miracle management-.-and it is so. It seems to me&#xD;
should be the happiest woman in the world if I could&#xD;
be independent of hired girls and mantua..makers. I&#xD;
tell Mr. Shawthey 're the plague of my life. Oh, if&#xD;
my girls could make their own dresses and have them&#xD;
fit as exquisitely as Carry's and LQtty's do, I should be&#xD;
so rejoiced. How dreadfully Mary B~rber's dresses&#xD;
hang on her. By the way, Mrs. More, did you know&#xD;
that old Mrs. Barber is quite sick??'&#xD;
"Oh, yes, she 's been sick some time."&#xD;
"Is Dr. 1\4ore her physician?"'&#xD;
they employ Dr. Smith, I believe."&#xD;
My stars! you amaze me, Mrs.~More! that misei~.&#xD;
&#xD;
able homoepathist! Astonishing that people will be&#xD;
such fools! to think of their trusting her in his hands,&#xD;
when there 's such .a skillful physician as Dr. More&#xD;
close by; why I have n't the least confidence in that&#xD;
kind of practice-and Dr. More enjoys such a repute.&#xD;
Lion too! Mr. Shaw says that if Dr. Billings had n't&#xD;
been our family physician before Dr. More came here,&#xD;
he should certainly have employed Dr. More. How-&#xD;
ever, Mrs. More, between you and me, I presume Dr.&#xD;
~~Eore has escaped an undesirable job. I should think&#xD;
old Mrs. Barber would be an excessively disagreeable&#xD;
patient. She is so very repulsive when she 's welL&#xD;
Don't you think so&#xD;
"Well, I don't know; she 's rather reserved--&#xD;
though I like her."&#xD;
"Reserved! my stars! she 's as cold as an icicle-&#xD;
I don't see how you can like her, especially when she&#xD;
has treated Dr. More so shabbily."&#xD;
"I did feel rather hurt that they discharged Dr.&#xD;
More; but they were urged by some of their friends&#xD;
to try the homcoopathic system. It's not from any&#xD;
want of confidence in Dr. More-tbky are very friends&#xD;
ly to him-and I dare say they '11 employ him again,&#xD;
at some future time, if they 're not satisfied with Dr.&#xD;
Smith's practice."&#xD;

them; li~ certainly ought to do so. ~ I went in there&#xD;

Shaw that the morning was so fine, I must get round&#xD;
