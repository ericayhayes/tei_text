Entered accdiuw to Act of Congress in the year 1E~1, by&#xD;
AKAIDMAN &amp;amp; ORMSUY,-&#xD;
in the Cloe;'s Oi o of the Distriet Court of the United Sets fi r the Southern Di ,riet&#xD;
of New-York.&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
AnLle! Oh, how beautiful! Eyes dark&#xD;
as night, when no star shall pierce its ebon&#xD;
gloom ; hair glossy as the untamed .raven's&#xD;
wing ; brow clear in its brunet hue, loft'&#xD;
with thought's sculptured mould ; features all&#xD;
womanly, yet majestic ; figure full, queenly,&#xD;
erect, y t lithe ac the poplar. Such was she-&#xD;
yet otly seventeen years had she existed.&#xD;
Beautiful a a flower in the wild-wood, and&#xD;
all as unprotected ! Yet she had a mother-&#xD;
end such a mother ! Yet she had a sister, and&#xD;
such a sister ! Reader, ere this tole is finished,&#xD;
you will shudder to think howy cold and'heart.&#xD;
less humanity can be.  I saw  her in her&#xD;
beauty-admired-had not misfortune's ice&#xD;
once chilled, and the faithless one of other&#xD;
days have torn my heart's warm cells wide&#xD;
asunder, might have loved her. But 'tis past.&#xD;
Adalie is dead. Cold were her cheeks, and&#xD;
pale her chiseled lips, when last I gazed upon&#xD;
them. Death had claimed her as his bride.&#xD;
Poor Adalie !&#xD;
Her murderers! They must suffer. Aye,&#xD;
they must writhe, while that viper, conscience,&#xD;
gnaws upon their hearts. Let them read this&#xD;
tale. Let them remember, and she will be&#xD;
avenged.&#xD;
On a soft and balmy evening, in early&#xD;
spring, in Rue de Bieuville; in New (Orleaxns,&#xD;
two ladies were seated on the second story&#xD;
piazzo of one of the old French built houses,&#xD;
&#xD;
so common in that ancient city. One was a&#xD;
lady whose age might be forty or forty-five ;&#xD;
but time had spared her considerable beauty.&#xD;
Large-well formed--even volutuously so,&#xD;
with a complexion betokening her creole ori-&#xD;
gio, she, in the abenne of her companion,&#xD;
'would have been thought by many a judge,&#xD;
(Daly not excepted,) handsome. Yet a close&#xD;
observer of cha racter would be more inclined&#xD;
to 11ear than admire her.  Her black ek e, thor&#xD;
large and expressive, glittered with a fierce&#xD;
fire, a serpent like glare. icr lips were&#xD;
thin, and, like her are-Jd nostrils, seemed&#xD;
to be -perpetually quivering like the aspen.&#xD;
leaf on its slender bough. Hier features, tho'&#xD;
perfect, were sharp. Hei appearance alto.&#xD;
gether indicated a passionate temperament.&#xD;
[hr dress was exceedingly rich.  Jewels&#xD;
glittered in her hair, on her plump and round.&#xD;
ed arms, on her small, tapering fingers.-&#xD;
Beating the stcli air wihha pearl-handled fan,&#xD;
she sat, glancing at the various passers-by,&#xD;
many of whom cast their eyes up toward&#xD;
her.&#xD;
She was Madame Minervie d'Bouligny,&#xD;
the mother of Adalie. Adalie was seated&#xD;
near. No jewel needed the young girl to&#xD;
adorn her peerlees form. Dressed in plain&#xD;
white, shy shone bright as a Venus freshly&#xD;
risen from the ocean wave. But her eyes&#xD;
were nut glancing down towards the prome.&#xD;
naders on the batture. Soft and pensive as&#xD;
the eve itself, they gazed up into the quiet&#xD;

&#xD;
sky, where the stars could he dimly seen as&#xD;
the twdight deepened irto nitnht. Yet ar&#xD;
lovely lac wore an expresion of care and&#xD;
anxiety.  This look increased, when her&#xD;
mother remarked&#xD;
" Adalie, do you see that tall gentleman on&#xD;
the batture ?  H-e has passed and repassed&#xD;
here several times--his eyes constantly lixed&#xD;
on you !'"&#xD;
" Yes, Mamma," she replied,  i met him&#xD;
in the street also, to day, and his manner is&#xD;
impertinent; to say the least, it is to me very&#xD;
annoyirig !"&#xD;
" H-e seems to admire you f"S&#xD;
" The admiration of a min whomt I dislike&#xD;
is no compliment to me, mcmma."&#xD;
fBut he is good looking, and is well-yes&#xD;
more, he is very richly dressed !"&#xD;
"lie can ford to dress well !" replied&#xD;
Adalie.&#xD;
"hen you know him ?"&#xD;
"Yes, mamma, he has often cast boquets&#xD;
upon the stage, with notes to me. I have&#xD;
never noticed themr, or his proposals--Oh&#xD;
mamma, when you sent me on the stage you&#xD;
did a cruel deed. You placed me before the&#xD;
eyes of a world of libertines, and since then&#xD;
no happiness has been mine!"&#xD;
"Pshaw, child, you are too particular. But&#xD;
this gentleman--who is he ?"&#xD;
"Mr. Mal pin!"&#xD;
What, the rich merchant of ChartresI&#xD;
street ?"&#xD;
"Yes, mama."&#xD;
"And you, like a foci, slight his atten-&#xD;
tions? He might marry you -make you and&#xD;
me independent for life !"&#xD;
"No, manna !" said the young girl, sor-s&#xD;
rowfully, " he would never marry a don-&#xD;
seuse ; my profession will forever debar me&#xD;
from such a station in life. And besides, I&#xD;
would not marry him-not even for all his&#xD;
wealth.  I will not marry where I cannot&#xD;
love! "&#xD;
&#xD;
Â° Love !n cried the mother, irpatiwntly.&#xD;
" Love  It is but a word.  loterest is a bet.&#xD;
ter. What else have we to live for. He can.&#xD;
not eat love.  We cannot dress on it. Ne.&#xD;
ver speak to me of love.  It were bette-r to&#xD;
be a rich man's mislre8s without love, than a&#xD;
poor man's wife with it !"&#xD;
A daia shund ered, but she sail nothing.&#xD;
Again the tall nan passed and a boquet fell&#xD;
at her feet. With a movement of scorn she&#xD;
spurned it fron'the piazza. As she did so,&#xD;
her mother in a tone of anger cried&#xD;
'' You are, a fool, girl-1 fool!"'&#xD;
Tihe gemtlemanIn hrd the expres ion-saw&#xD;
the act, and n expressive glance passed he.&#xD;
tween hi o and the brother. 'TEwas but a&#xD;
look, it worlt cauld not have more plainly&#xD;
told that his suit br the daughter would no&#xD;
be opposed by the oeather, ei tho' shame&#xD;
was to be the droom of poor Adalie.&#xD;
*     *    *    *     *    *&#xD;
Two hours later. Adalie sat in-her charn&#xD;
ber, robed in the ioisnabille of the couch.-&#xD;
She was about to retire. Yet, era she did so,&#xD;
she knelt down by her bedside and prayed.&#xD;
Yes, the dancing girl prayed. For whom-&#xD;
herself?  Alas, so-tho' herself environed&#xD;
with dangers, she prayed for God to hess and&#xD;
protect one who was far away. She drew a&#xD;
portait from her bosom-hissed it passionate-&#xD;
ly, gazed upon it as iftnr eyes would devout&#xD;
it. "Eugene !' she murmured -" dear Eu-&#xD;
gene, shall I ever behold thee-press my lips&#xD;
to thine, so enfold thy manly form to this&#xD;
breast as I now embrae   its shadow.  For&#xD;
years unseen and unseeing-tho' lofty moun&#xD;
tains, deep rivers and broad vales have divided&#xD;
us, have I loved you. Will you love me&#xD;
when we meet. . Will we meet? Yes, you&#xD;
-say you will come to me !&#xD;
She drew a worn letter front her bosom,&#xD;
carefully opened its creased folds, and read it.&#xD;
"Yes-dear one--yes, '" she continued,"&#xD;
you will come and love me too-aye, and&#xD;
&#xD;
protect me from the base insults of the wretch&#xD;
es Who would dr ive nme to di-pair. Oh coUe&#xD;
soon ry Eugene- Mcome 'crc I perish !''&#xD;
Araai:n breathing a prayer, the lonely vyunir&#xD;
girl cast herself on the bed-one small hand&#xD;
ressiog the mininature to her heaving bosom&#xD;
-the other clasping the letter.&#xD;

the marks ot dissipation 'were evident in the&#xD;
ruddy glow of his fee, and mitthis reckless&#xD;

toe elder spoke as they passed dow n the&#xD;
str  t  " You tricked Gardner out of a nice&#xD;
sum to night, Orrn !" he s' id.&#xD;
" About five hundred only !" said the other&#xD;
carelessly. " But he'll get it back-Come in&#xD;

" What the devil do you wLh another rimg&#xD;

Y Yes, and I'm the last of the fl-ck, but&#xD;

As they entered the store a man who had&#xD;
stood unobserved in the shade of a porch next&#xD;
the dour, stepped out, and with- a quiet&#xD;
chuckle, muttered&#xD;
" There's fun ahead. i'll take the items&#xD;

were adorned with drawings and designs.-&#xD;
Reader, permit me to introduce you to Mr.&#xD;
Flundummery. lie is in a brown study&#xD;
just now, he always is. But see he starts&#xD;
from his chair.&#xD;
" An idea !'' he cried. " Yes, I've got it-&#xD;
i've got it. Syrnmres was right, the earth is&#xD;
hollow-the skii '11 fly off one of these days&#xD;
and expose the inner world. But, ah! another&#xD;
idea! When the outside flies off at a tangent&#xD;
in consequence of the earth's rotary motion,&#xD;
the, people will have to go too. It can be&#xD;
rernedied only in one way.    Excavations&#xD;
thirty feet deep mut he nado, and all who&#xD;
pierce the earth to that depth will be safe.&#xD;
Grand idea. Yet another-coming events&#xD;
cast their shadows befhre-something will&#xD;
pre-indicate the sho k ---nen i ight go up far&#xD;
enough in a balloon, and light gain after all&#xD;
was over. That's a good idea.  MIust confer&#xD;
with Mr. Wise on that subject, Who's there&#xD;
-come in ?",z&#xD;
This last remark wos caused by a knock&#xD;
at the door. It opened, and a female en.&#xD;
tered.&#xD;
She was a very fair specimen of the plump.&#xD;
rosy-checked, good h umored daughters of&#xD;
Erin, who, in our large cities, perform almost&#xD;
exclusively the duties of houso-servant and&#xD;
washer- woman.&#xD;
"The blessin of the houly virgin light on&#xD;
ye, Sir i" she- said, dropping an awkward&#xD;
courts. "I've come for yer honor's linen !"&#xD;
" Linen -. the dressed product of ihx !"&#xD;
muttered Mr. F. " Very intcresting process&#xD;

" I want yor honor's dirty c!t-he s, plom !"&#xD;

" Ah, yes, Bridget, yes, immediatel-but&#xD;

" A hemmorrage, Bridget !"&#xD;
" What kind of a hem is that, sir, plase ?&#xD;
I've heard of hem stitches, but never of a&#xD;
hernorrige !"&#xD;
"Bleeding -only a proper and scientific&#xD;
word for bleeding !"&#xD;
"Is that all ! Sure, and what's the use o'&#xD;
havin' two words to mane the same thing.&#xD;
It's like having two stocking's on one fit, isn't&#xD;
it. ' But may be it was meant that poor folks&#xD;
like me should say blade when we blade, and&#xD;
the hard word was made for rich folks, like&#xD;
your honor. Sure, hard words must be a&#xD;
luxury !"&#xD;
" Will you sew on the buttons, Bridget ?"&#xD;
c Sure, yis, yer honor, but why don't yer&#xD;

" The women are all fools, Bridget-all&#xD;
fools !"&#xD;
"Not quite, yer honor ! I know one, and&#xD;
that's my mother's only daughter, that isn't&#xD;
such a fool, even f she is poor !"&#xD;
Poh, girl; what do you know of sci-&#xD;

C  Pob, child, you do not comprehend me.&#xD;

rences related in the beginning of the second&#xD;
chapter, a young woman was seated in a. par.&#xD;
lor, naatl y, but not richly furnished, reading&#xD;
a late novel. The light which came softly&#xD;

"Dear Charles, I'm so glad you've come&#xD;

you look ill, what is the matter ?"&#xD;

pushing her rudely away.&#xD;
Anger in a moment, like the sparks from&#xD;

an instant subsided and tears rose in its&#xD;
place.&#xD;
"Charles !" said she, 4"once the pressure&#xD;

" We are married.'" ho said coldly, inter.&#xD;

"When we feel like it ! Charles Gardner,&#xD;

most delicate flower. Remember, sir, if this&#xD;
v ontinues, you are not the only man in the&#xD;

not drive me to an act of desperation !"&#xD;
" Threaten ?  What do on m+an, Fanny,&#xD;
what could you do ?"&#xD;
" Do?   Resort to aneglccted wife's only&#xD;

" Fanny, is this !pu ?'&#xD;
"No, Charles, it is not, it is only what you&#xD;

" When did you see Orrin Bird, last ?" he&#xD;

I'll attend more to my business !"&#xD;
" And stay at home, evenings ?" asked the&#xD;
young wife in a kinder tone.&#xD;
Yes I"&#xD;
" Then I will kiss you, and do all that I&#xD;

18           TILE MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
humanity; men who, nobly forgetful of the&#xD;
sacrifices both in time and feeling which&#xD;
an honorable fulfilment of their duties calls&#xD;
t upon them to make, have made them without&#xD;
a murmur, and felt their reward in the con-&#xD;
sciousness of having performed their obliga-&#xD;
tions to society, honor and the State. These&#xD;
men, however, are not appreciated as they&#xD;
should be by the public; not because the&#xD;
oommuuity does not stand ready and willing&#xD;
e to commend and reward those who serve it&#xD;
0 faithfully-but because the men 1 speak of&#xD;
have too much manhood, diffidence and prin.&#xD;
Y ciple to brag of their own merits and blow&#xD;
their owrn trumpets to the public; and as&#xD;
h their rivals are too selfish and ungenerous to&#xD;
mention their faithfulness and good qualities,&#xD;
s the consequence is the p or fellows' claims&#xD;
Never, except by accident, reach the public&#xD;
"ear. The chief blame in this, as in the ma-&#xD;
j ority of public abuses, rests with the press,,&#xD;
which never, unless its editors and reporters&#xD;
are kept constantly easy by black mail, re&#xD;
port thenerits of any body ; and when they&#xD;
do, the chances are that the man they recom.n&#xD;
mend or applaud is of litth'or no account,&#xD;
Â£ and is himself the writer of the very para-&#xD;
graphs which eulogise him. It is a notorious&#xD;
fact that there is scarcely a newspaper in&#xD;
New   Orleans whose opinions cannot  be&#xD;
bought at the simple fee of twenty-five cenis&#xD;
$ per line--the majority of them for one half&#xD;
i that sum. I myself am cognisant, of the fact&#xD;
that a certain reporter of the daily press wil-&#xD;
d fully kept back from public mention the rec-&#xD;
ord of the saving of a citizens' life who had&#xD;
I fallen accidentally from the Levee, and&#xD;
would have been drowned but for the timely&#xD;
interposition of an officer, who, at the risk of&#xD;
rt his own existence, plunged in, arid after the&#xD;
most-.superhuman efforts, succeeded at lg }&#xD;
- in briegihg the man in safety from the winter&#xD;
No mention was made of this noble perform&#xD;
anet pf the officer, simply because he was a&#xD;
&#xD;
Native Amnerican in principle, and the report.&#xD;
er i black mouthed Englishman, whose na.&#xD;
tional prejudices would not allow him to see&#xD;
any thing good in an American who nobly&#xD;
stood up for the interest of his country-&#xD;
And this same foulheaded. Englishman has&#xD;
been heard to assertthat he would never, un-&#xD;
der any circumstances, mention favorably in&#xD;
the paper of which he was the principal quill&#xD;
driver, the name of any Native American-.&#xD;
and he has kept his word;so far as his posi-&#xD;
tion would allow him. I repeat it : the press&#xD;
of New Orleans is mainly to blame for the&#xD;
miserable manner in which the great majority&#xD;
of the public departments are coati acted.&#xD;
The reporters display greater smallness, to&#xD;
use an expressive hibernicisrm, than those of&#xD;
any other city with which I am aeiailuted.&#xD;
They judge of a man's merits by his liber-&#xD;
ality towards themselves. If they can use&#xD;
him, that is, borrow money within t being&#xD;
compelled to refund it, he is a first rate fellow.&#xD;
If a member of the police is not liberal in&#xD;
supplying them  with drinks whenever he&#xD;
meets them, his efficiency, as a public officer,&#xD;
if he be efficient, never reaches t public&#xD;
eye through the medium ofithe papers.  And&#xD;
even if some great robberyoccurs, in which&#xD;
his superior abilities enable him to achieve&#xD;
the capture of the robbers and the restration&#xD;
of the stolen goods, the reporters, in giving&#xD;
their accounts of the transaction, wiifu'ly omit&#xD;
altogether the name of the policeman, or sub-&#xD;
stitute another who is in favor with them, or&#xD;
purposely alter and mis-spell iit, to gratify&#xD;
their petty dislike of the man. Hence the&#xD;
members of the police, finding that to be&#xD;
really worthy i of but little account, since&#xD;
it brings them  it her good nane nor bread,&#xD;
gradually fall into the general corruption&#xD;
whii h pervades their ranks, and go in for&#xD;
the chances. Still, as I have sak, there&#xD;
ar. mea ainongi them, who ate an honor&#xD;
to ieir office, a cryalit, to hmtntiney and&#xD;
&#xD;
their cry. But there are others there wht&#xD;
are too ainly described in the above sketch&#xD;
to have their characters mistaken. And such&#xD;
characters will be found in the police ofaevery&#xD;
city, until an American system is adopted&#xD;
and the Native born, or those who have long&#xD;
been used to our laws, customs and institu&#xD;
tions are placed ire office, and none others!&#xD;
Would to God such a system were already&#xD;
in operation, then it would not be necessary&#xD;
for me to write such tales and draw such&#xD;
scenes as these ti attract the public eye to&#xD;
the evils existing in our midst. I repeat again&#xD;
that I men no slur upon the Police of New&#xD;
Orleans as a body, but want all to wear the&#xD;
coat that fits them.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
Two days more have passed in our rapid,&#xD;
true and eventful history. In a parlor of the&#xD;
house in Bienville St., described in the first&#xD;
chapter, two persons were seated, Adalie,&#xD;
and her mother.&#xD;
" I expect a visitor this morI ing, Adalie !"&#xD;
said the latter.&#xD;
"I might have known as much by the way&#xD;
you are dressed--so much more jewelry than&#xD;
you usually wear in the morning !" replied&#xD;
the lovely young girl, quietly.&#xD;
" Have you no curiosity to know who he&#xD;
is ?" said the mother, impatiently.&#xD;
"No, mother,what are your visitors to me?"&#xD;
"This one may be a good deal yet. I&#xD;
yesterday received a note from Mr. Malpin,&#xD;
requesting an interview !"&#xD;
"You have consented to it-it is him you&#xD;
expect ?" s.id the young girl, while her brows&#xD;
and cheeks reddened and her form shoos&#xD;
with sudden excitement.&#xD;
" Yes, -it is nearly time he, should be&#xD;
here !"&#xD;
"Then I will retire !"&#xD;
&#xD;
 Do child, and dress yourself a little bet.&#xD;
ter, he nay wish an introduction-in fact he&#xD;
said as much yesterday in his note !"&#xD;
'Then he will not get it !"&#xD;
 "Yes he will ! His note is very gentle.&#xD;
manly, very much so, and you shall not in.&#xD;
sult my friends, Miss, or if you do, you will&#xD;
rue theday !''&#xD;
"Mother, mother, would you pander to&#xD;
your.child's ruin.. That man seeks me but&#xD;
to destroy !" said Adalie, tearfully.&#xD;
"I don't believe it. Yo' are a suspicious&#xD;
young fbol--your sister isn't' like you !''&#xD;
" No, but she is pure yet, mother. Do not&#xD;
let her be destroyed. Ah, there is a ring at&#xD;
the door bell-it may be him. Remember,&#xD;
mother, I will not see him."&#xD;
"  we'll see-we'll see!" said th heartless&#xD;
woman coldly, as her daughter left the room.&#xD;
- Yes," muttered Madame d'Bouligny, to&#xD;
herself, " Adalie must give herself up to&#xD;
this man. lie will pay like a prince, and as&#xD;
even men of his stamp are not to be picked&#xD;
up every day, I must make the most of him.&#xD;
As to this honor that the stupid girl prates so&#xD;
much about, I'd like to know what it is good&#xD;
for, if by holding on to it she gains not ing&#xD;
but a little self-esteem, which, after all, is&#xD;
nothing; whereas, money, which she can get&#xD;
in thousands if she is willing to part with it,&#xD;
money is every thing. One can get along&#xD;
very well in these days without honor; but I&#xD;
should like to know how we could live with-&#xD;
'ut money ! I don't see where the stupid&#xD;
thing gets her high ridiculous notions ! lion.&#xD;
or, indeed ! What right has a girl without&#xD;
a fortune to such a thing? She don't inherit&#xD;
her nonnsensical ideas from me. I never&#xD;
boasted of my honor, and I can't conceive&#xD;
by what right she should. A rich and hand-&#xD;
some man like this Mr. Malpin could have.me&#xD;
t any time. :fHonor, indeed !"&#xD;
At this moment, a servant announced Mr4&#xD;
Malpin.&#xD;

Mr. M. appeared to be about thirty-five&#xD;
years of age-was of genteel exteir, evi-&#xD;
dertly a " tan of' the World " in thegeneral&#xD;
meaning of that term. Dressed richly, yet&#xD;
not with vulgar over taste, he was such a&#xD;
man as would a y where be s t down as a&#xD;
"gentleman," by ca-ual observers. But&#xD;
in the bright color which sIffuse I his face&#xD;
one might see the tint of the debauchee ; in&#xD;
the thick lip and sensual expression about&#xD;
the lower part of his face, a sign of a licen-&#xD;
tious, or at least of a voluptous disposition.&#xD;
H1 is figure was fine -in short he was a very&#xD;
good looking man, and he wats aware of it.&#xD;
lie bowed low as he entered, and in a tone&#xD;
of studhd politness, said:-&#xD;
"iMalam, I feel honored and happy at ma-&#xD;
king your acquaintance."&#xD;
'-The pleasure is reciprocated, Sir," re-&#xD;
plied the lady--' having often seen you and&#xD;
been struck with your air llstingue, I have&#xD;
desired to know you."               ,&#xD;
" Really, Madeit, you (latter me. It has&#xD;
iong been my desire to make the acquaintance&#xD;
of yourself, and your scarcely more beautiful&#xD;
daughter.  In fact I can scarcely believe&#xD;
that you have a daughter, for I should not&#xD;
believe you to be over twenty or twenty-three&#xD;
or four at the uttuost."&#xD;
"Oh, Sir, you compliment me undeserved.&#xD;
!y ; I am a little older than that ! '&#xD;
" Where is your lovely second-self, the&#xD;
beautiful Adalie, this morning, Madam ? "&#xD;
" She is not very well, I believe-fatigued&#xD;
from dancing last evening-but I will see it&#xD;
she is not presentable. Excuse me a mo-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
"Pretty good beginning-the old lady&#xD;
seems all right!" muttered Malpin to himself;&#xD;
as the mother left the room. " A little flat-&#xD;
tery and plenty of money will keep her on&#xD;
my side !"&#xD;
A loud altercation between the daughter&#xD;
and mother in another room now reached his&#xD;
&#xD;
ears, and he advanced close to the door te&#xD;
hear it.-&#xD;
" I will not see that man, mother-" he&#xD;
could hear her say. "I hate him-I can't&#xD;
bear the sight of him-he is my horror even&#xD;
when I see him from the stage I"&#xD;
" You shall see him, you contrary thing-&#xD;
I say you shall see him !" replied the mother&#xD;
angrily.&#xD;
"If 1do, it will be to insult him and to tell&#xD;
him I detest him L" said the pure, high-spirited&#xD;
girl.  "You had better not force me to&#xD;
that !''&#xD;
" If you don't behave yourself and act like&#xD;
a lady, I'll force you to worse than that !"&#xD;
said the mother spitefully. "I'll turn you&#xD;
out of doors !"&#xD;
" It is better mother if you do, for if these&#xD;
doors are to be opened . to every libertioeini-&#xD;
town, they can no longer protect mue. If I&#xD;
cannot live virtuously in your house, I will&#xD;
try to do so out of it !"&#xD;
"By Jove the girl is a trump-she is a&#xD;
prize worth conquering," muttered the liber.&#xD;
ine&#xD;
" low do you know but Mr. Malpin means&#xD;
to offur marriage, you fool ?" continued the&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
"Marriage !" echoed Adalie. Marriage!&#xD;
lie, the aristocratic son of wealth, think of&#xD;
marrying me, a poor danseuse---an actress/&#xD;
You know better. No, he is like other men,&#xD;
he thinks gold can win the poor actress to his&#xD;
arms, but they shall all learn that one at least&#xD;
can live purely even if she is placed in that&#xD;
polluted atmosphere !"&#xD;
"Yes-I suppose you'll starve yourself&#xD;
and ume too!"&#xD;
"Mother-my salary is not large it is true&#xD;
--but it is enough h, if we live economically !"&#xD;
" Ecenomically !  I hate the word ! 'hat&#xD;
is to say we're to dress in calico and live on&#xD;
gruel I"&#xD;
" I would rather'so dress and so live, mo&#xD;
&#xD;
excuse my delay, sir," she said-.." Adalie is&#xD;
not very well and needs. much urging to&#xD;
make her appearance !"&#xD;
" Or more frankly, Madam, does she not&#xD;
harbor a dislike for me and whish not to see&#xD;
me ! I accidentally overheard a remark  of&#xD;
hers just now, which indicated such a fel&#xD;
ing ! "&#xD;
" Be not angry then with the poor girl,&#xD;
kind sir, she is young and foolish, but I am&#xD;
sure if she gets acquainted with you she can-&#xD;
not but be pleased with you!"&#xD;
"I should hope so, for to speak truly I have&#xD;
never seen a lady either on the stage or off&#xD;
so lovely as she is. One half the town seems&#xD;
to be in love with her."&#xD;
"And she seems to care nothing for love&#xD;
or admiration."&#xD;

" Say nothing fair lady, wear it and con-&#xD;

Will you he at the Theatre to night "&#xD;
" Yes Sir, and if when the last (lance is&#xD;
over, you await us at the stage door, you can&#xD;
walk home with my daughterand myself."&#xD;
"A thousand tanks, Madam, my carriage&#xD;
shall be there. Feet so small as yours and&#xD;
hers should never touch the earth."&#xD;
Mr. M. did not wait till the widow  got&#xD;
through blushing and acknowledging this last&#xD;
offer and compliment, but arose and bowed&#xD;
himself' from the room.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
,rns war:a. .&#xD;
It was three o'clock. In a private room at&#xD;
a fashionable and celebrated Restaurant on&#xD;
St Charles street, two of our friends were&#xD;
seated at dinner. One was Orrin Bird-the&#xD;
other our friend Malpin. As is often the&#xD;
case with young men, while they sip their&#xD;
wine, their conversation had turned upon&#xD;
women.&#xD;
"I've just left the house of Madam  De&#xD;
Bouligny," said Malpin.&#xD;
"Ah, your scent lies in that direction?&#xD;
How is the fair Adalie ?  They say she is&#xD;
pure as a lily and cold as an icicle!"&#xD;
"She shall not be so long. The lily can&#xD;
be plucked, the icicle thawed---and so can&#xD;
woman be won!"&#xD;
"She wont see anybody, though I tried to&#xD;
make her acquaintance myself, but could'nt"&#xD;
&#xD;
"You'did'nt go to work right-you should&#xD;
do as I have done, court the mother first  I&#xD;
am to take a rife with them to-night-at least&#xD;
I'm to take them home from the theatre, and&#xD;
I rather think the ride will extend as far as&#xD;
the Lake."&#xD;
"I'd like to act as your coachman, but&#xD;
I'm engaged-l've got a beauty in view, and&#xD;
instead of courting the mother, I'm courting&#xD;
the husband!"&#xD;
" Your divinity is married, then ?"&#xD;
wes-fortunately she is, so there'll be no&#xD;
breach of promise-no suit for damages or&#xD;
anything of that kind. I hrte law. I'd&#xD;
fight any time for a woman, but I'd not go to&#xD;
law for the best of them!"&#xD;
" Who is she ? "&#xD;
" I'll tell you if you keep mum! "&#xD;
" Certainly, I will."&#xD;
" Then its Fanny Gardner."&#xD;
" What ! Why you was arm in arm with&#xD;
her husband when I met you!"&#xD;
"Certainly, and he thinks I'm a capital&#xD;
fellow-only a little too lucky at cards.  I've&#xD;
won three thousand from him within a month."&#xD;
"The devil you have. Why he can't af-&#xD;
ford to lose-he was nearly ruined by the fall&#xD;
in cotton-Mills the broker refused his pa&#xD;
per to my certain knowledge."&#xD;
"So much the better for me-.when he is&#xD;
broke my plans will work the easier. If he&#xD;
should find me out,he'd hai-dly shoot a man&#xD;
to whom he is obliged for pecuniary aid."&#xD;
Don't trust to that, Orrin my boy--don't&#xD;
trust to that. But how stands the lady affec-&#xD;
led ? "&#xD;
" So- far she is chaste as Penelope, Lut she&#xD;
has blood in her veins and fire in her heart.-&#xD;
rhe will yet do that for revenge which love&#xD;
would never prompt. She is exacting and&#xD;
jealous ; he is careless and neglectful. A&#xD;
good bottle-of wine, a pack of cards and two&#xD;
or three jolly fellows can keep him  up all&#xD;
tight,.any time!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well such a man ought to be fooled. But&#xD;
Orrin let us make a bet. We have hih set&#xD;
our hearts on gaining prizes that will be all&#xD;
the richer because of the difficulties in our&#xD;
way. Let the one who first succeeds in his&#xD;
aim, give the other and a few choice friends&#xD;
as good a dinner as the Verandah can set&#xD;
out."&#xD;
"Agreed-I'm booked for that--a fihr start&#xD;
and no gouging."&#xD;
"It is understood-let us have cofl-e now&#xD;
and adjourn. I've some letters to write this&#xD;
afternoon-and want to prepare for this eve.&#xD;
ning?."&#xD;
" And I've a visit to make to my F anny."&#xD;
"Don't call her your Fanny till you win&#xD;
her, Orrin&#xD;
"That time shall not be long coming!&#xD;
said the other with a laugh.&#xD;
After their coffee was finished, the gent'n, a&#xD;
men retired-one to write his letters, the c ,i&#xD;
er to dress for his intended visit.&#xD;
Fanny Gardner looked beautiful that after.&#xD;
noon. Dressed in a loose evening dishabille,&#xD;
lanquid any dreamy from the warm flower&#xD;
laden atmosphere she breathed, she reclined&#xD;
on a sofa near the window of her parlor,&#xD;
slowly waving a fan with her small white&#xD;
hand. The - artificial breeze gently raised&#xD;
the hair above her placid brow-her lovely&#xD;
forn, scarce concealed by the thin light dra-&#xD;
pery shle wore, was disposed in a voluptous&#xD;
abandonment of attitude-her small slipper-&#xD;
ed feet resting on a low attoman and so&#xD;
placed as t/o reveal the outlines of her slender&#xD;
ancle and even fuller proportions slightly&#xD;
above.&#xD;
[fir dark blue eyes were half closed, and&#xD;
the long dark lashes drooped over her spotless&#xD;
cheek. She looked a being made only to&#xD;
love and to be loved-a flower for a Sultan's&#xD;
garden-not for this work-a-day world of&#xD;
,ours, btut for a world of romance.&#xD;

But it was too late. Her visitor stood he&#xD;

Dressed with scrupulous taste and care--&#xD;
slightly flushed with the generous wine o!&#xD;
which he had partaken, and anxious to appear&#xD;

tired of this world the longer I live in it. To'&#xD;
me it is almost like a desert !"&#xD;
"I am astonished to hear you say so, sir,&#xD;
young, gifted, with ambition to prompt you&#xD;
forward, what can there be to make you un-&#xD;
happy ?"&#xD;
"The lack of a single being to take an in-&#xD;
terest in my welfare-to love me, to watch in&#xD;
&#xD;
" Oh you will not long lack e wife, if that&#xD;
is what you mean," said the lady laughing,&#xD;
"I've no doubt that there are a dozen young&#xD;
ladies already dying for you, especially if&#xD;
report speaks the truth."&#xD;
"Believe not reports, lady--Rumor has ay&#xD;
lying tongue. I never shall marry .&#xD;
"Never rilarry ?  Why Mr. Bird--what&#xD;
is the reason of that terrible (letermination,&#xD;
said with such a sigh too ? ,,&#xD;
"i'll tll you some day why I will not mar.&#xD;
ry-hut that is not what I came to do, I&#xD;
came as a friend of yours and of your hue.&#xD;
band, to talk with you about him-fbr I feel;&#xD;
a deep interest in his welfare.''&#xD;
T 'hen why do y ou keep him out so late at&#xD;
migat ?~&#xD;
" I do not-he wi/ stay out, and if I watch&#xD;
over hun to see that he does not get robbed&#xD;
among the crw.d of sharpers in our city, I can.&#xD;
not be blamed for it.''&#xD;
The lady looked at him with an expression&#xD;
of incredulity on her lovely face. He con.&#xD;
tinned -P&#xD;
" Two nights go, he was determined on&#xD;
play.  We were not in honest company, l:&#xD;
feared to s e 'm in their clutches, so played&#xD;
myself and won all he had with him. It was&#xD;
this that brought mehere this afternoon-in&#xD;
this diamond ring is invested the five hun-&#xD;
dred dollars I won from him. It is safer in;&#xD;
your hands than his. I have never won a&#xD;
cent fror him that is not now safely invested&#xD;
and subject to your order ; from his passier&#xD;
for gaming, I can see that ruin must come&#xD;
upon him ! ''&#xD;
Mrs. Gardner started like one in a drean.&#xD;
Tears rose in her beautiful eyes. "Oh, Mr&#xD;
Bird, how cruel and unjust I have been ."&#xD;
she cried; "I have deemed you a gamester&#xD;
arid a libertine, and all this time you havwk&#xD;
been acting such a noble part.  Forgive meY-&#xD;
&#xD;
25&#xD;
&#xD;
and accept my thanks-my grateful thanks !"&#xD;
"Lady, I am rewarded by the conscious&#xD;
ness of having served one so good as your-&#xD;
self. Whenever you need a friend, you will&#xD;
find one in me. if sorrow or trouble comes&#xD;
upon you, feel to me as a brother, and apply&#xD;
as freely."&#xD;
"God bless you, Mr. Bird ; but this ring,&#xD;
1 cannot wear it.  My husband will ask&#xD;
where it came from ?"&#xD;
"Tell him it was sent you in this note-&#xD;
see, I have prepared it-only these words are&#xD;
written in it. ' A tribute to worth, virtue and&#xD;
beauty from a respectfulfriend.' "&#xD;
"Ihow   generous even in your oomph&#xD;
ments. Mr. Bird, I kno\v not how to thank&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
"Again, fair lady, let me say that I am&#xD;
amply rewarded in the pleasure of being able&#xD;
to serve you, and I shall continue to watch&#xD;
over him you love, and do all that I can to&#xD;
keep him out of evil associations and to break&#xD;
up his convivial habits. But I must make&#xD;
my excuses, I shave an engagement-good&#xD;
evening U'&#xD;
"What a noble hearted young man! oh&#xD;
that Charles was like him!'-' murmured the&#xD;
young wife, as she sat down and tried on the&#xD;
ring after she was alone.&#xD;
That was enough. The seed was eown.&#xD;
The seducer's first step was taken. The&#xD;
wife had drawn a comparison between him&#xD;
and her husband, and all comparisons are&#xD;
dangerous-such ones as this, especially so.&#xD;
Beware young wife of this--have no eyes&#xD;
but for him you love, and you will never'see&#xD;
his faults.&#xD;

One of the neatest Theatres in the Southl&#xD;
is Plaoides Varieties. Pontlar with the peo.&#xD;
&#xD;
pie because of various attractions ; it is eier&#xD;
filled with a brilliant and showy audiences&#xD;
Reader, take a stage box with me and enjoy&#xD;
an evening there. We will see the the love-&#xD;
ly Mrs. Howard, the bewtiching lilariot, mo-&#xD;
dest Barron, funny Maugin graceful Vegas&#xD;
and last, but not least the fair Adalie.&#xD;
And in front there'll be the handsome Ed-&#xD;
itor that didn't get shot-the great little Auc-&#xD;
tioneer---and a mass of stockholders who&#xD;
think they have a right to everything in the&#xD;
theatre, behind the scenes especially ; a bevy&#xD;
of beauty and fashion, and a parquette full&#xD;
of happy, hearty boatmen who have just come&#xD;
down the Father of Rivers to see the Elephant&#xD;
and sell off their " truck."  Many of them&#xD;
come down on flats to see sharps as soon as&#xD;
they reach the city. But come to the box--&#xD;
let's see what is going on,&#xD;
The play is "The School for Scandal," a&#xD;
capital play if played, "a horrible event" if&#xD;
butchered. Placido Chippendale, Charles&#xD;
Bass, Mrs. Howard are cast in it-.-of course&#xD;
it goes oft well. Hosi the ladies in front hide&#xD;
their pretty faces with their fans when a&#xD;
rather broad allusion is made ; how the dear&#xD;
creatures frown when scandal is spoken of&#xD;
as a favorite amusement of their sex, tell.&#xD;
ing thus with their sparkling eyes that even&#xD;
the truth rnusn't be told at all times. The&#xD;
piece goes on---goee on well-the last actAs&#xD;
rnished, scandal gets its due and virtue its&#xD;
reward "according to copy," and the cur-&#xD;
tain falls. Then a short interlude during&#xD;
which fans and lorgnettes are busy in the&#xD;
dress circles, while 'young men are absent&#xD;
minded enough to go out for spiTritual conso-&#xD;
lation at the next saloon. Then the orches-&#xD;
tra strike up--the curtain rises and out, like&#xD;
a winged fairy and an Apollo bound the&#xD;
lovely Hillariot and the manly Vegas. They&#xD;
dance the Bolero.  How bewitching-now&#xD;
hand in hand, then flying far apart, then&#xD;
wheeling in rapid circles-their feet keep,&#xD;

felt that even her own blood was cold towards&#xD;
her, that even her mother loved her not ;&#xD;
valued her only for her talent and beauty, as&#xD;
the means of adding to her income. Poor&#xD;
Adalie, well may we pity thee.&#xD;
But the last play is over, the green curtain&#xD;
has descended and the people are departing&#xD;
for their homes. Adalie has already changed&#xD;
her dress, and in a simple frock of plain&#xD;
white muslin, leaves her dressing room with&#xD;
her mother. They retire by the back door&#xD;
of the theatre, emerge from  the narrow al.&#xD;
ley-way upon the street,. when she beholds&#xD;
the hateful form of her persecutor before her.&#xD;
He stands with his hand on the open door of&#xD;
his carriage, waiting for them to enter. Her&#xD;
mother had not told her of this arrangement,&#xD;
she would have hurried past, but her mother&#xD;
detained her*:&#xD;
We will accept Mr. Malpin's invitation,&#xD;
dear," said the latter, "and let him take us&#xD;
home!"'&#xD;
"I prefer walking, the distance is short!"&#xD;
said Adalie.&#xD;
" Don't make a fool of yourself, here be-&#xD;
fore folks ;" said the mother angrily, almost&#xD;
forcing her into the carriage. The next mo-&#xD;
ment she was in also, and then Mr. Malpin&#xD;
was seated before , them, and the carriage&#xD;
drove slowly on.&#xD;
"You met with most triumphant success&#xD;
to-night, Miss Adalie, I never have seen you&#xD;
look or dance so well as you did this even.&#xD;
ieg," said Malpin, after the ceremony of an&#xD;
introduction had passed.&#xD;
"Did I ?" said she, abstractedly.&#xD;
"The whole house was in raptures; half&#xD;
the gentlemen present were dead in love with&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
She made no reply to this last remark.&#xD;
But a moment later, casting a glance to-&#xD;
ward a corner they were passing, she said :&#xD;
&#xD;
"Your driver is taking us in a wrong di-&#xD;
rection, sir. This is not Bienville street !"&#xD;
"True, fair lady, but with your mother's&#xD;
permission, we'll drive down to the lake and&#xD;
have a supper !"&#xD;
"I have no objections !;' said Madame De&#xD;
Bouligny, hastily.&#xD;
"But I have !" said Adalie, firmly. "I&#xD;
am fatigued-sick---must go home !"&#xD;
"We will not be gone long--a glass of&#xD;
wine will revive you, do let us go Miss&#xD;
Adalie !" said Malpin, pleasingly.&#xD;
"If my mother wishes to go she- can, of&#xD;
course, consult her own pleasure, but I will&#xD;
not-i can walk home if you will have the&#xD;
kindness to stop your carriage and let me get&#xD;
out."&#xD;
" You're a fool, Ndalie. Don't listen to'&#xD;
her-go on !" said her mother,&#xD;
"Do it, and I will scream for-assistance !"&#xD;
said the spirited girl. " Oh Eugene, Eugene,&#xD;
why are you not here to help me now ! Mr.&#xD;
Malpin, if you are a gentleman, take me&#xD;
home !"&#xD;
"Certainly, Miss Adalie, if you insist upon&#xD;
it !" said he, coldly, giving the necessary&#xD;
orders to his driver.&#xD;
"There's a pleasant evening spoiled by&#xD;
your froward temper !" muttered the mother.&#xD;
"Curse your Eugene's !"&#xD;
Adalie made no reply, but the geat tears&#xD;
which coursed down her pale cheeks were&#xD;
indicative of the agony of her heart.&#xD;
When they arrived at the door, Madame&#xD;
D"e: B. invited Malpin to enter, but he declined,&#xD;
remarking that he would call to enquire after&#xD;
Miss Adalie's health, in the morning. This&#xD;
was some relief to Adalie, who hurrying to&#xD;
her chamber, locked herself in to avoid the&#xD;
storm of wrath she had reason to expect.&#xD;

I never wrote a love letter in my life-not&#xD;
even by way of an experiment. I've exper-&#xD;
imented upon every material but a woman's&#xD;
heart--never tried that. Have heard of a&#xD;
work on the art-" Ovids-art of Love," so it&#xD;
t must require some scientific knowledge to do&#xD;
l it skilfully. I'll get my wits to work and&#xD;
see what C can do at any rate."&#xD;
Drawing a chair up to his writing table&#xD;
the gentleman seized a pen, and selecting&#xD;
r some letter paper from amid a mass of draw-&#xD;
d ings, specifications &amp;amp;c., commenced his task.&#xD;
e But it seemed diricult to him. He made two&#xD;
or three commencements, erasing the words&#xD;
e again. "Miss Adalie"-wrote. " No, that&#xD;
e is too cold and formal"---he said. "My Dear&#xD;
, Miss Adalie---no that is too familiar, previ.&#xD;
vious to an acquaintance-charming Miss&#xD;
, Adalie. She is charming but she may think&#xD;
o I want to flatter her. Confound the thing&#xD;
why can't I hit, the proper phrase. I'll say&#xD;
Fair and virtuous lady : that '11 do. I know&#xD;
she's one and I believe she is the other. Now&#xD;
what next. Pardon the audacity of a man-&#xD;
no, I'll say gentleman, who has fallen a vic-&#xD;
tim-no that won't do. A victim   sounds&#xD;
as if I made a sacrifice in loving her. Let me&#xD;
el see-who has-who has seen you but to ad-&#xD;
g mire, admired but to love. There that's pret-&#xD;
is ty fair, I think, for a beginning. Now I've&#xD;
i- started I can go along. The-start is always&#xD;
y the hardest point. I could move the world&#xD;
he out of its sphere with the archimedian lever&#xD;
is if I could only start it an inch. He then&#xD;
ed wrote on rapidly, but was soon interrupted&#xD;
, by a knock at the door.. Biddin-r the intro-&#xD;

&#xD;
der enter: he looked around to see who en-&#xD;
tered. It was Bridget, his washerwoman,&#xD;
with her basket of clothes.&#xD;
"Here I am,likethe dawn o' day,your honer,&#xD;
with your honer's linene and tho' its not meself&#xD;
should that spake it, shure nobody's linen,not&#xD;
even Quti. victory'ss was better done up.&#xD;
"You are a good girl,Bridget, i sm always&#xD;
satisfied with your work, but l'n in a quan-&#xD;
dary to night."&#xD;
"What sort of a diary is that, sir ?"&#xD;
"A quandary, a" fix"  "Bridget, I have&#xD;
been trying to write a love letter."&#xD;
"A love letter sure, Sir. I got one my-&#xD;
self only yesterdayy"&#xD;
"How did it commence, can you remem.&#xD;
her ?"&#xD;
"Sure I can, the commencement and the&#xD;
ind also. It was short and swate. This was&#xD;
all there was in : Bridget darlin, I love you&#xD;
entirely, be the powers o' mud I do, and am&#xD;
e thin kin' wud ye marry me? If yis, me and&#xD;
tl,, praste are ready, and I've got a cart and&#xD;
na a horse and a uow at;d a stable for them&#xD;
atu two rooms for ourselves in a convainent&#xD;

P1 an, brother to Burney Phalans neice&#xD;
Kauleen that ye are intimate vid, where first&#xD;
I saw yer purty face. Send along an answer&#xD;
soon will ye, plaze."&#xD;
"A curious letter, but very characteristic,&#xD;
but my letter is not exactly like it. I'll read&#xD;
it to you Bridget and see what you think of&#xD;
it-they say two heads are better than one1!"&#xD;
"Â«Be me faith, ye may well say that yer&#xD;
honor, and that's the rason I sent word to&#xD;
Micky by Kathleen that if the praste was&#xD;
ready two wakes, from Sunday, which wud&#xD;
give me-time. to get me clothes all ready, I'd&#xD;
marry wid him!"&#xD;
"Well, 'm glad to hear it Bridget ; but&#xD;
I'll read you my letter !"&#xD;
" Won't you tell me who its to, Sir, first ?"&#xD;
"Mis Adalie do Bouligny"&#xD;
&#xD;
at&#xD;
&#xD;
"And do you mane honest ay the blessed&#xD;
lady-is it yer wif'e yer askin her to be ?"&#xD;
" Certainly-she is a hood beautiful girl."&#xD;
" Yer honer never spoke a truer word than&#xD;
that. But go on wid the letter, plase--I'm&#xD;
all in a hurry to hear what you say to the&#xD;
angel."&#xD;
"Well, listen. Fair and virtuous lady&#xD;
pardon the audacity of a gentleman -"&#xD;
"Stop a moment if you please Sir. What&#xD;
is the audacity-I don't know what it is. Is&#xD;
it all right and proper V"&#xD;
"Yes, it means boldness, my good girl."&#xD;
" Ah yis, I see. You ax her to forgive&#xD;
your honor for bein' so bould as to write to&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"Precisely so-now don't. interrupt me&#xD;
again, but lisen ; pardon the audacity of a&#xD;
gentleman who has seen you but to admire,&#xD;
admired but to love you. Nor.deem that in&#xD;
these lines will be expressed on thought&#xD;
which can bring the blush of anger upon your&#xD;
lovely cheeks.&#xD;
My motives for addressing you are honor.&#xD;
able-I wish to make'your acquaintance in&#xD;
hopes that when you know me better, you&#xD;
may be induced to listen to a proposal of mar.&#xD;
riage from me. I am in the prime of my&#xD;
manhood-alone in the world, with wealth&#xD;
which could place every luxury around you&#xD;
in a sphere which you are fitted to adorn and&#xD;
take you from the stage where the coarse&#xD;
gaze of the libertine can but abash one so&#xD;
pure as you. Believe me sincere in my ad.&#xD;
miration, pure in my wishes. If permitted&#xD;
to call upon you, you shall never have rea.,&#xD;
son to regret my acquaintance. I have ming-&#xD;
led but little in society, my time and atten-&#xD;
tion for years has been given to the advances&#xD;
meant of science. I have never before spoken&#xD;
of love, or even felt its power."&#xD;
"What do you think of that Bridget-what&#xD;
shall I add to it ?"&#xD;
"Why yer name to be sure Sir, and then&#xD;

"Yes Bridget, and there's the postage."&#xD;
"What a gould Sovereign ?" Sure an' if&#xD;
being post-man is so profitable, I'd like to larn&#xD;
the trade entirely. I'll make Micky go at it&#xD;
so I will."&#xD;
"He'd better stick to his cart Bridget-&#xD;
but I want you to hurry with the letter. I&#xD;
shall feel so anxious till I get the answer !"&#xD;
"I'll do it yer honer and say a good word&#xD;
for you myself. 1'm sure the young lady&#xD;
thinks a dale o' me-she always speaks so&#xD;
kind and gentle. Sure its a blessed luck I&#xD;
have to be workin' for such good people."&#xD;
Bridget having first deposited her employ.&#xD;
er's linen in a beureau draw, took up her bas-&#xD;
ket and the letter which was now ready and&#xD;
departed.&#xD;
Again Mr. Flumdummery relapsed into.&#xD;
his brown study, but his mind now again&#xD;
turned to science. "I wonder if the moon is&#xD;
peopled ?" He murmured. "I can see by&#xD;
my telescope that it is like the earth ; has its&#xD;
mountains and its valleys, its rivers and its&#xD;
lakes, and yet I doubt whether people can live&#xD;
there. I think the climate is too hot -that it&#xD;
is all on fire inside and the crust is thinner&#xD;
than that which separates us from the fire&#xD;
which burns eternally within the earth. What&#xD;
a study is creation !"&#xD;
Mr. F. studied on until his head fell back&#xD;
in his easy chair and his snores told that he&#xD;
was exploring the land of Dreams.&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
A CHAFTrR OF INCIDENTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"What d'yo say to a drive to the lake&#xD;
and a dinr, this afternoon, Charley !" said&#xD;
Bird after the notes of Gardner had been duly&#xD;
&#xD;
paid. "I'll have my double team put to my&#xD;
light barouche and I think I can take down&#xD;
some of the fast odes. Will you go ?"&#xD;
"Yes, anywhere, or do any thing you ask,&#xD;
Orrin. You have saved my honor this day&#xD;
and I shall never forget it."&#xD;
" Wouldn't your lady enjoy the ride too'f&#xD;
There are seats for three besides my driver,&#xD;
and I always drive my own team when I&#xD;
strike the Shell Road. We can come back&#xD;
by the way of'Carrolton, it will be delightful&#xD;
I think."&#xD;
" Yes, so it will. I know Fanny will be&#xD;
pleased to go. She used to dislike you very&#xD;
much, but now she is just the other way. If&#xD;
you were not the noble fellow, and true friend&#xD;
you've proved yourself to be, i'd almost be&#xD;
tempted to feel jealous !"&#xD;
" Pob, never feel jealous of me--I think a-&#xD;
great deal of your lady, but it is as a brothers&#xD;
foels for a Sister. Were she not your wife&#xD;
Charley I should think nothing of her."&#xD;
" Well, love her as hard as you please&#xD;
Orrin- can trust in your honor, 1 hnow ."&#xD;
Indeed you can," said Bird  "but now&#xD;
go and get ready while I have my team go&#xD;
out. I'll call for you in half an hour."&#xD;
they parted, after paying a visit the " Pa-&#xD;
cific" where they took a friendly smile.&#xD;
The Shell Road extends from the suburbs&#xD;
of New Orleans down to Lake Porichartrain,&#xD;
along the banks of the Canal which connects-&#xD;
the lake and the city. It is only about five}&#xD;
miles in length, but is hard, and almost as&#xD;
smooth as marble, making one of the most&#xD;
beautiful tracks for fast driving in the world.&#xD;
It is broad enough for three or four wagons;&#xD;
to drive abreast, level as a floor, and not too&#xD;
hard for the horses' hoofs. It is made of the&#xD;
sea shells of the lake gathered from the beach&#xD;
and broken up fine. It is the favorite for the&#xD;
"fast ones" of New Orleans--and on a pleas.&#xD;
ant afternoon, especially on a Sunday it is&#xD;
thronged with gay parties in light vehicles of&#xD;
&#xD;
33&#xD;
&#xD;
every kind and description. At the lower    "Dey is dat, and' dis chile helped to do it,"&#xD;
&#xD;
end of it, a splendid Hotel is kept by the well&#xD;
known Captain Dan Hickok, where the best&#xD;
of edibles and bibibles are ever kept on hand,&#xD;
and where the placid waters of the beautiful&#xD;
lake invite the bather or the fisherman,rolling&#xD;
up its surf close before his door. Thousands&#xD;
of visitors crowd there every day to enjoy the&#xD;
cooling breeze from the water, sail in the&#xD;
beautiful Yachts there, or partake of the&#xD;
bountiful fare in the shape of fish, flesh and&#xD;
fowl which Captain Dan's cook " Loucy"&#xD;
serves up in exquisite style.&#xD;
About three quarters of ar -hour after&#xD;
Bird had parted from Gardner, a spken lid light&#xD;
harouche drawn by two large and power-&#xD;
ful gray pacers, turned from the plank road,&#xD;
on to the "Shell," near the gate, bound down&#xD;
to the Lake. A liveried servant sat to the&#xD;
left of the driver, back of them on the second&#xD;
seat of the low bodied, high wheeled carriage&#xD;
sat a lady -and gentleman, their faces bright&#xD;
with pleasure.  We know    the party, of&#xD;
,  course, Bird was the driver. As they turned&#xD;
out on the road, two light waggons also&#xD;
drove rapidly on.&#xD;
"Dere's Grey Eagle and Julia, Massa&#xD;
Ortin, Dey think dey can give us de go by,&#xD;
guess dey git fool by'n by when de team&#xD;
wakes up !" said the servant grinning till he&#xD;
exhibited all his ivories.&#xD;
" Yes, there is the Colonel driving Julia&#xD;
and Charley Pierce driving Grey Eagle&#xD;
'They are both fast nags!" said Bird.&#xD;
"Can you beat them Orrin ?" asked Gard&#xD;
net.&#xD;
"Pm going to try !" said the other.&#xD;
-; ' Is not racing veay dangerous where ther&#xD;
are so many people on the road ?" asked th&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
"Not where a team is properly handled !&#xD;
said Bird-my horses know me-a word front&#xD;
me will bring them from a run, down int&#xD;
a walk. -They are \well trained.&#xD;
&#xD;
liuskied the negro.&#xD;
They had now passed the toil-gate and&#xD;
their pace became more rapid. Those.in the&#xD;
light buggies ahead saw, or rather heard the&#xD;
barouche coming on at a tremendous pace,&#xD;
and gave their steeds the lash, supporting&#xD;
them  with a still and steady rein. The&#xD;
slower teams on the road were passed as if&#xD;
they were standing still, while Bird slowly&#xD;
gained on the two best nags in the city.&#xD;
Grey Eagle kept the lead-Julia was close&#xD;
behind, and Bird's splendid team followed&#xD;
close in her wake.&#xD;
"Flow fast are we going ?" asked Gard-&#xD;
ner.&#xD;
Going it in two forty, sure !" said Bird.&#xD;
' Bress de lor, we is dat ! Go long dere&#xD;
you grey niggers !" cried the delighted ser-&#xD;
vant.&#xD;
We are gaining-my team will bear the&#xD;
pace longer than they can !" said Bird, with-&#xD;
- out turning his eyes. in a few moments&#xD;
they were at the half-way house-cheers&#xD;
rose from an hundred lips as they passed the&#xD;
hotel, the steps of which were crowded with&#xD;
visitors who had stopped to " wash down the&#xD;
dust." The horses like those on a race&#xD;
track seemed maddened into extra exertion&#xD;
by the cheering-on, on they dashed-now&#xD;
breaking into a run, but by the voice and&#xD;
rein, soon brought down to their work. ' As&#xD;
Bird predicted, however, the heavy team had&#xD;
the bottom, and gradually gained. Swerving&#xD;
slightly to the left, Bird opened on the buggy&#xD;
in which the Colonel sat ; steadily, almost&#xD;
imperceptibly he gained until at last he was&#xD;
e clear and had begun to lap with Grey Eagle.&#xD;
e They were now on the last mile ; the lake&#xD;
could be seen down the straight avenue ahead&#xD;
" and the-excitement grew more intense.&#xD;
o    "Beautiful, beautiful !" cried Mrs. Gard-&#xD;
o ner, as the barouche swept on and Grey&#xD;
Eagle dropped behind. "Beautiful indee&#xD;

this is the first ride I ever really enjoyed, the&#xD;
speed of the wind and as smooth as sailing&#xD;
over waveless water."                  -&#xD;
Another moment, and they were before the&#xD;
hotel, and as Bird had said, with a word,&#xD;
scarcely pulling a rein, he brought his fiery&#xD;
horses to a stop, so close to the steps of the&#xD;
ladies entrance to the hotel that they could&#xD;
step to them without touching the ground.&#xD;
"You ought to have lived in the days of&#xD;
the Olympian games, Mr. Bird, so as to have&#xD;
won the laurels in the Chariot-races at Ro0 e.&#xD;
I have never seen a driver at once so fearless&#xD;
so skilful and so graceful as younelf !"&#xD;
"I'll have to let your husband drive going&#xD;
up, fair lady, to convince you that there are&#xD;
even better drivers than myself !"&#xD;
"I would feel safer when the reins are in&#xD;
your hands Sir-you know your horses.&#xD;
What magnificent animals they are, but they&#xD;
must be tired. I pity the poor creatures--&#xD;
see how they pant, while the white foam&#xD;
drops from their mouths.&#xD;
"My boy will soon cool them ofi but let&#xD;
us walk in and breathe over a glass of wine."&#xD;
"Rather let us walk down to the bay. it&#xD;
looks so beautiful."&#xD;
"Yes," said Gardner, "let us do so, and if&#xD;
we can get a boat we'll have a sail. I'll&#xD;
yield the palm to Mr. Bird in driving, but in&#xD;
sailing a boat I think I can do as well as&#xD;
any one !"&#xD;
"Let me run in and order dinner to be&#xD;
ready against our return and then I'm with&#xD;
you !" cried Bird.          ,&#xD;
"What a noble fellow he is-all heart !"&#xD;
said Gardner.&#xD;
"Lie is indeed !" said his wife, her face&#xD;
beaming with pleasure.&#xD;
In a few moments Bird returned followed&#xD;
by a boy who bore some wine and fruit.&#xD;
"We'll enjoy these," he said "down at&#xD;
the lake-side, where it is cooler than here."&#xD;
They were soon seated on the shady side&#xD;
&#xD;
of the large Bath House, with the bright&#xD;
waters of the lake dashing up at their feet,&#xD;
enjoying a glass of Longworths Catawba and&#xD;
looking out upon the clear blue lake befere&#xD;
them which was spotted far and near by the&#xD;
snowy sails of many a beautiful little yacht.&#xD;
"Ilow I would like to take a sail ?" said&#xD;
Mrs. G. as she gazed on the lovely scene.&#xD;
"You shall dear, but wait till Orrin and&#xD;
me have finished this bottle. It is too good&#xD;
wine to leave Uncorked ?"&#xD;
"You had better not drink till we return,&#xD;
dear husband !"&#xD;
" Poh-only a bottle, wont phaze me ! I&#xD;
could drink two and not feel it !"&#xD;
"Please don't Charles !"&#xD;
"He can't," said Bird laughing, as he&#xD;
pushed the half emptied bottle into the lake.&#xD;
A look of gratitude from her bright eyes paid&#xD;
him for the act.&#xD;
"That's a shame to waste such good wine&#xD;
Orrin !" said Gardner.&#xD;
"Oh its nothing. There's more like it&#xD;
where it came from to which we can do jus.&#xD;
tice at dinner. But now let's get a boat-&#xD;
there's the Lady of the lake, that little clip-&#xD;
per sloop at anchor there. She is just the&#xD;
thing for us-two can manage her-i'll&#xD;
send up to Dan and hire her. Or we needn't&#xD;
do that ; here boy, jump into that boat and&#xD;
row us along side. We can unmoor he:&#xD;
ourselves-we'll be back in an hour, I told&#xD;
Louis we must have dinner at five."&#xD;
The three were taken on board of the&#xD;
little yacht by the servant, and casting oft&#xD;
her moorings, [she was fastened to a buoy]&#xD;
hoisted her mainsail and jib and with a fine&#xD;
leading wind stood out into the lake. The&#xD;
wind was fresh, about an eight knot breeze,&#xD;
just enough. to carry whole sails without&#xD;
danger. The lake was not however rough,&#xD;
there being only sufficient swell to make the&#xD;
boit move lively on the water and fling a&#xD;
little spray over the party. Gardner took the&#xD;
&#xD;
OF NEW OIU1&amp;amp;NS.&#xD;
&#xD;
helm and attended the main sheet, while his I&#xD;
wife and Bird sat farther forward and to&#xD;
windward to trim the boat. The lady was&#xD;
delighted, so were her companions. There&#xD;
is nothing more pleasant than to bound over&#xD;
glad waters with a fast craft under you, and&#xD;
a fine breeze blowing, providing that your&#xD;
craft is stiff'and the wind steady. But the&#xD;
Lady of the Lake, though very fast, was a&#xD;
little coquetish, she had scarcely sufficient&#xD;
beam, and as the wind freshened and became&#xD;
a little squally sne laid over at times till the&#xD;
water poured in over her lee gunwales. This&#xD;
rather alarmed the lady who begged her hus.&#xD;
band to go in again. [He however laughed&#xD;
at her fears, while Bird j ined in her request&#xD;
and then he prepared to stand in again.&#xD;
They were four or five miles from the shore&#xD;
and the wind had freshened a good deal&#xD;
Seeing that Gardner was going to run her&#xD;
off before the wind and jibe her, a manoeuvre&#xD;
not always the safest,'Bird who understood&#xD;
Boating very well, remonstrated.&#xD;
"You had better haul her up close on the&#xD;
the wind and tack her, Charley !" said he.&#xD;
"In jibing you might heel her over, or at&#xD;
least carry away something."&#xD;
'No danger, here she goes! See how&#xD;
nice I'll do it," said the other, putting up his&#xD;
helm and squaring off before it.  For a mo&#xD;
ment the boat ran with lightning speed, her&#xD;
large mainsail filling to the heavy breeze.&#xD;
then just as he was ,in the act of jibing, or&#xD;
letting the boom come over so as to bring the&#xD;
wind on the other quarter, a heavier gust&#xD;
struck her. She jibed, but her main sheet&#xD;
had got foul and did not run through the&#xD;
block,'she broached too and in a moment she&#xD;
was over. It twas a fearful moment.  Mrs.&#xD;
Gardn'er shrieked and clung to the seat&#xD;
whereon she sat, and as the boat went entirely&#xD;
over, she of course was under it.  When&#xD;
&#xD;
But Bird in a moment thought that she might&#xD;
have got entangled in the rigging ofd the boat,&#xD;
or having clung to it as she did, and without a&#xD;
word disappeared in search of her. A long&#xD;
agonizing moment elapsed ere lie ro-appeared,&#xD;
but when he did, the drooping form of the&#xD;
senseless woman was in his arms. Raising,&#xD;
her head to his shoulder he gained the bow-&#xD;
sprit of the boat, where resting one arm over&#xD;
it, he kept her face above the water, bidding&#xD;
Gardner remain where he was so as to steady&#xD;
the boat which barely floated.&#xD;
"Is she dead-my God, is she dead ?"&#xD;
cried her husband.&#xD;
"No, her heart beats, she breathes. If&#xD;
we can hold on a little w~le, help will come.&#xD;
They must see us from the shore-yes, there&#xD;
is a sailboat coming off!"&#xD;
Bird heard a sigh from the lips of the beau-&#xD;
titull woman whom he strained to his breast,&#xD;
and then she slowly opened her eye:.&#xD;
" Where am I ?" she faintly murmured.&#xD;
"Safe dear lady, safe-help will soon&#xD;
reach us !" replied Bird.&#xD;
"Charles, where is Charle?" " Safd also,&#xD;
clinging to the other end of the boat."&#xD;
"And you Mr. Bird have saved my life~&#xD;
the life he all too madly risked !"&#xD;
I am but too happy in having done it !"&#xD;
he replied in a low soft tone. Tieir eyes&#xD;
net and in that look love unutterable was&#xD;
spoken. Gardner was looking towards the&#xD;
shore whence that expected assistance was to&#xD;
come and did not see that glance, nor did he&#xD;
see Orrin Bird press his burning lips to her&#xD;
brow. She blushed, but she did not reprove&#xD;
him. Nor did she chide him that he pressed&#xD;
her form so closely to his breast. Perhaps&#xD;
she thought it was necessary to sustain her&#xD;
so. In about twenty minutes, to them   it&#xD;
seemed an hour, help reached them from the&#xD;
shore and they were taken in to the hotel.&#xD;
&#xD;
Bird rose to the surface both he and Gardner Changes of apparel were soon procured, and&#xD;
were horrified to find that she did not rise, now thai the danger was past, they laughed&#xD;

&#xD;
lightly at the peril they had encountered,-&#xD;
and over such a dinner as only Captain Dan&#xD;
can g .t up in that latitude, they forgot that&#xD;
" death had stood knocking at the door" that&#xD;
day. Gardner, as usual, drank deeply, and&#xD;
when at ten o'clock they drove in, he was&#xD;
again stupidly, disgustingly drunk, while&#xD;
Bird was just sufficiently enlivened with wine&#xD;
to be interesting and pleasant. Dangerous&#xD;
indeed for her peace and her husband's honor&#xD;
was-the contrast between Gardner and Bird,&#xD;
as Fanny was forced to see it. Her hus.&#xD;
band was obliged to Bird for salvation from&#xD;
pecuniary ruin, she supposed, she owed him&#xD;
a life. Ah little did she see through the plot&#xD;
which was working for her ruin. Little did&#xD;
she suspect that her husband had been led&#xD;
into all of his excesses by the man she was&#xD;
so fast beginning to love. When they arriv-&#xD;
ed at home, Gardner was so tipsy that he had&#xD;
to be carried in, and this added to her morti-&#xD;
fication. She was so put out, that when in&#xD;
parting, Orrin Bird kissed her hand with&#xD;
warm and feverish lips, she did not even with.&#xD;
draw it till the salute had been thrice repeat.&#xD;
ed. Then, though she blushed and trembled&#xD;
she uttered no word of reproof. The sCdu&#xD;
cars arts had already had an effect and though&#xD;
she had not sinned even in thought, all un-&#xD;
knowingly her heart was yielding to a new&#xD;
love. And was this unnatural? No. Who&#xD;

CHAPTER XI&#xD;
Mr. Malpin was seated with Madame De&#xD;
PBouligny in the parlor of the latter, and both&#xD;
were conversing in a low tone, for A dalie,&#xD;
though not in the room, was near. A ho   ti&#xD;
of choice wine, taken from a basket which he&#xD;
had that morning sent around to the Madame,&#xD;
was on the table, and half filled glasses were&#xD;
in their hands.&#xD;
"It is as you say, Sir, time that we plainly&#xD;
understood each other in this matter, for as&#xD;
she opposes us both, we can only act in con-&#xD;
cert, or not act at all. I am ready to hear&#xD;
any proposition you have to make," said&#xD;
Madame De Bouligny.&#xD;
"Then, Madame, I will he candid. You&#xD;
are well aware of the position of myself in&#xD;
society, the aristocratic feelings of my family&#xD;
who would never consent to my union with&#xD;
an actress, although I love your daughter&#xD;
well enough, I assure you, to marry her. But&#xD;
my father, from whom I expect at least a half&#xD;
million of dollars would disinherit me, and&#xD;
that would be a serious sacrifice to me. My&#xD;
present income is large, but even the capital&#xD;
which I use is his, and could be withdrawn.'&#xD;
Though he is not a strict man, he is a proud&#xD;
one, he cares not who I may have for a mis-&#xD;
tress, but on the point of matrimony he would&#xD;
be imperative. I can lavish five or six thou.&#xD;
sand a year on one that I love, and that I love&#xD;
Adalie, you cannot doubt. But my position&#xD;
is peculiar. I can be generous, I can be fond&#xD;
and true to her, but I cannot marry her."&#xD;
" Yes," said the lady, with a hypocritical&#xD;
&#xD;
ded and cultivated.  Neglect her and she sigh, "I can see how you are placed. And&#xD;
dies.  And to him    only who   properly Adalie, on the stage where no one remains&#xD;
attends to her does she appear in all her with name unstained, cannot, at best, long re-&#xD;
&#xD;
main unslandered. If she has the name she&#xD;
might as well yield to har fate, fbr, as [ told&#xD;
her the other day, it is better to be the mis.&#xD;
tress of a rich and generous man, than the&#xD;
wife of a poor one But if I should consent&#xD;
to this marriage without a ceremony-&#xD;
" I would immediately make a handsome&#xD;
settlement on yourself and daughter.  You&#xD;
rent this house, I believe ?"  o&#xD;
Yes, Sir, and pay very heavy rent too.&#xD;
It takes nearly all her salary to pay it."&#xD;
'he house, newly furnished, shall be&#xD;
deeded to you, and you shall have a carriage&#xD;
and horses, and one thousand dollars for mcin&#xD;
dental expenses,the day Adalie becomes mine."&#xD;
" You are generous, Sir. 1 believe it is for&#xD;
the child's own good that I yield my ready&#xD;
consent. Yes, you shall have her"&#xD;
"C The next thing is to win her consent.&#xD;
Her ,dislike for me is an obstacle not easily&#xD;
to be overcome."&#xD;
"There is but one way, I will see to that.&#xD;
She shall be yours. Once yours, she will&#xD;
always be so,for then she would not dare,with&#xD;
her pride, to go to the lover she is always prat-&#xD;
ing about."&#xD;

her."&#xD;

"Then no time must be lost. Where is he&#xD;

and her lip trembling with scorn.&#xD;

The gentleman emptied his wine glass and then a bobt or two withdrawn, the door was&#xD;

thought, and then muttered : " [t shall be with two eyes glittering like the orbs of an&#xD;

&#xD;
shrill voice cied; "it is well, a woman and&#xD;
alone. Come-in, no harm shafl befall you it&#xD;
harm is not intended and I can read your&#xD;
thoughts."'&#xD;
The designing woman entered the room&#xD;
and seated herself on a rickety stool which&#xD;
the other pointed to. The room was meanly,&#xD;
but strangely furnished. Over a fire place&#xD;
in one corner, hung a large iron cauldron&#xD;
On shelves around were bottles, glass retorts,&#xD;
chemical apparatus; weapons of various&#xD;
kinds and nil scattered in indiscriminate dis-&#xD;
order. In a corner near the door lay a large&#xD;
black wolf dog, whose red, glairing eyes and&#xD;
tusky jaws made him look as if he feasted on&#xD;
human flesh.&#xD;
But the female who inhabited this strange&#xD;
apartmnri: was a picture in herself. She&#xD;
was small, slender, and tawny as a gipsyher&#xD;
eyes bright and piercing as those of a ba-a&#xD;
lisk. Her features indicated an Italian de-&#xD;
scent--that nation  having  a peculierhy&#xD;
possessed by no other. I1er dress was a&#xD;
mixture of the peasant costume of Italy and&#xD;
the Moorish. Her slender waist was em-&#xD;
braced by the laced bodice of the former;&#xD;
she wore a shirt of scarlet velvet that only&#xD;
reached to the knee., But her lower limbs&#xD;
were covered with the loose troa sers of the&#xD;
Moorish woman, and her small feet were&#xD;
thrust into red slippers. On her head she&#xD;
}   wore a kind of fantastical crown--composed&#xD;
principally of the faded leaves of the cypress&#xD;
Poorly furnished as was this room, the open&#xD;
&#xD;
Y-&#xD;
&#xD;
door which led to a inner chamber permitted&#xD;
one to see that it was far better fitted up. In&#xD;
fact there was a strange contradiction in the&#xD;
appearance of slovenness and poverty in the.&#xD;
one and in the luxury and neatness of the&#xD;
other. The "Sybil," for as such was she&#xD;
known to the few whom she admitted to her&#xD;
presence could not have been over thirty five&#xD;
years of age and were it not for her small&#xD;
eye, and a serpent like expression in her lace&#xD;
&#xD;
might have been considered handsome. But&#xD;
the mark of evil passions was on her-it could&#xD;
be heard in her shrill, sharp voice, could be&#xD;
seen in every varying expression ot h r coun-&#xD;
tenanee&#xD;
" Well-you have come to me, brought&#xD;
gold, you say.  What do you want for it ?"&#xD;
"An antidote for the Poison you gave my&#xD;
daughter in a dagger's hilt-a portion that&#xD;
can produce sleep for hours.'&#xD;
The Sybil looked her steadily in the face&#xD;
a moment.&#xD;
"Yes-I see it all !" she murmured. "You&#xD;
are like the rest, you want gold too. Gold is&#xD;
precious; gold is precious."&#xD;
' To be sure it is.  With gold we can get&#xD;
all we want."&#xD;
" No-no !" mttered the Sybil. " Not&#xD;
peace of mind-not peace of mind. But&#xD;
what do 1 care-you shall have what you&#xD;
want, but mark my words woman you will&#xD;
curse the hour you took it from my hand,&#xD;
curse the day you came to see me. Your&#xD;
gold, for gold you will get, is stained with&#xD;
blood-blood of your own race. I see a corse,&#xD;
two corses, I see a maniac woman, a wan.&#xD;
dering man accursed upon the earth. The&#xD;
maniac woman is yourself."&#xD;
Frighten me not, good Salvi-f righten&#xD;
me not with such wild prophecies."&#xD;
"It must be accomplished-yes you shall&#xD;
have what you want. All is written-all is&#xD;
written!" muttered the wom n in a low tone.&#xD;
Then she went to a shelf and took a phial&#xD;
filled witIi a colorless liquid. " There is the&#xD;
antidote," she said. Then taking a box, she&#xD;
said-" here is a powder, tastless as air...-one&#xD;
grain will make one sleep an hour. Po sleep&#xD;
longer add a grain for every hour-and fear&#xD;
not their awakening. Now go -you have&#xD;
all you seek-you will get more than you ex.&#xD;

"Here is pay"-and the widow laid a purse&#xD;
of gold on the table.&#xD;

"The price of blood-the price of bloi !"&#xD;
murmured the Sybil as she fixed her gleam-&#xD;
ing eyes upon it.  When she looked up the&#xD;
widow  was gone. She    again barred and&#xD;
bolted the door, and lifting a square stone&#xD;
from the centre of her floor she cast the purse&#xD;
down upon a heap of other money already&#xD;
deposited in the hiding place, rriuitering as sie&#xD;
did so-' Gold is precious gold is precious.'&#xD;
t An hour later she had another visitor--one&#xD;
closely veiled and coarsely clad, yet a close&#xD;
veil and coarse garments could not conceal&#xD;
all the beauties of that foIrm, or break the&#xD;
grace of her movements. It was Adalie.&#xD;
"My mother has ben here !" she said, d-&#xD;
ter the Sybil had  cadted her.&#xD;
" It is written-it is wrima .t' ' said .hi&#xD;

"Oh Salvi what do you mean-.explain it&#xD;
to me."&#xD;
"It is written-it is written,then why should&#xD;
I pity her." Murmured the Sybil, unheed-&#xD;
ing the question of the anxious girl.&#xD;
"Oh Salvi-do speak to rme. My mother&#xD;
came here for some sing-what was it !"&#xD;
"Go-go and leave rue young girl your&#xD;
fate is written !"&#xD;
" I will not go till you tell me then. I am&#xD;
brave Salvi-1 fear riot to know it. Reveal&#xD;
for me the future."&#xD;
The Sybil shook he r head mournfully.&#xD;
" Go-go-it is written ? She murmured.&#xD;
"You said the loved ones shall sleep in theI&#xD;
same grave."&#xD;
" It is written-it is written !'"&#xD;
"Am I one of those ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" It is written ! Ask no more or the spirit&#xD;
of anger will come!'&#xD;
Adalie went irth. She had learned noth-&#xD;

"If I am only to die with Eugene,I am still&#xD;
happy" she murmured.     " But God will&#xD;
shield me and him. To um 1 look, in um I&#xD;
trust."&#xD;
ChIA PTER XII,&#xD;
It was the sane afternoon-the same hour&#xD;
when Adalie went fbrth desolate and sick at&#xD;
heart from the presence of the Sybil, that&#xD;
Orrin lird entered the parlor of Fanny Gard.&#xD;
ner. IIe knew that the husband was absent,&#xD;
'or ho had ot the '' (Coulonel'' to induce Gard..&#xD;

that he would not return before night and that&#xD;
thren he would be as usual, drunk-for he had&#xD;
intimated hi.s wishs on this point to one who&#xD;
was but to killing to help a man on to ruin&#xD;
when his own pocket could be benefitted by&#xD;
it-&#xD;
Cie fon *Fanny therefore alene, and very&#xD;
sad and lew spirited. She had been thinking&#xD;
of her bright visions of et r happiness so&#xD;
soon overcoued-of the habits of him whom&#xD;
she had vowed 'o love and honor, and w horn&#xD;
she could n't honor while he so degraded&#xD;
himself and her.  Hler lovel Oy es had been&#xD;
dimmed with tears, but she was beautiful in&#xD;
her calm sadness, as beautiful as even was in&#xD;
her bright gayety.&#xD;
" I'm ver'y glad you have come," said she&#xD;
after Bird had sa ed himself near her.&#xD;
Charles has ben gene all day, and I have&#xD;
the blues. llav eyou seen him ?"&#xD;
SI saw idm about one hour ago riding out&#xD;

" A md he told me he had business which&#xD;
would eccupy him all day. ,Oh, Mr. Bird?&#xD;
mine is a hird fate!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Strange that he can neglect such good-t&#xD;

th himself, but he spoke sufficiently bold force&#xD;
her to catch his words.&#xD;
Then turning to her, he said:&#xD;
" Perhaps he has ridden out on business."1&#xD;
" No-no," she sighed-" he has no busi-&#xD;

I know you would extenuate his faults Mr.&#xD;

neglect, not tofeel and know them."&#xD;
"'Would to God I could remedy them lady.&#xD;
Heaven knows I have tried."&#xD;
" I know you have my noble friend !" She&#xD;
said-' but it is useless to try. Oh that you&#xD;
had let me peri h when my'life was perilled&#xD;
by his rash carelessness on the lake !"&#xD;
" Do not say that. ,.Sweet lady. I would&#xD;
have perished with you had L not succeeded&#xD;
in saving you. Earth would be desolate to&#xD;
me were you not on it. Do not be angry with&#xD;
me for this rash, this wild declaration, but I&#xD;

woman, trembling, blushing and weeping.&#xD;

cried, casting himself on his knees before bet&#xD;

the only idol of my heart. Fanny, I can&#xD;
die, but I cannot'cease to love you. Oh, I&#xD;
could slay that man for his neglect, yet his&#xD;
attentions were like death to me. Fanny,&#xD;
deem it not madness, but to hear you say you&#xD;
love me-to have one kiss from your lips, I&#xD;
would forfeit a right to eternal life.&#xD;
t. Orrin"-she murmured. She had not&#xD;
withdrawn her hand.&#xD;
"Fanny-oh, angel ." and he kissed again&#xD;
that small white hand which trembled in his&#xD;
grasp. She bowed her head to his shoulder-&#xD;
tears rained down upon his neck.  Wildly he&#xD;
raised his face to hers-a thousand kisses he&#xD;
planted upon those lovely eyes, and strained&#xD;
her madly to his bosom.&#xD;
" Orrin, oh, Orri !" she murmured, but&#xD;
she did not strive to move from his embrace.&#xD;
"Fanny-Fanny, say but one word, that&#xD;
you love me-I ask no more ; even death&#xD;
will be welcome then !"&#xD;
" Orrin-dear Orrin !" she murmured-&#xD;
and her burning lips met his. She was lost.&#xD;
The wife had forgotten her love--her duty ;&#xD;
she loved another, and had confessed that&#xD;
love.' The seducer thought he had triumphed.&#xD;
[His hand was wildly pressed upon her full,&#xD;
throbbing  bosom.  Then, as the flush of&#xD;
passion, like an electric shock, flew through&#xD;
his frame and   eermed to communicate to&#xD;
hers, she broke from his arms, and threw&#xD;
herself all sobbing and trembling in a chair&#xD;
far from his side.&#xD;
" l Iny_-dear Fonny ! have f oflended&#xD;

"No, Orrin-oh, no. I have only offend.&#xD;
el myself. Sit down; let me get cali. I&#xD;

fortress was secure for him. The outworks&#xD;
had been taken ; the garrison had been&#xD;
tampered with ; its former commander had no&#xD;
influence there. After passing an hour of&#xD;
calm, yet fond and afectionate conversation,&#xD;
Bird imprinted a kiss upon the lips of the&#xD;
wife of his friend, and left. Three or four&#xD;
hours later, with a loathing heart she received&#xD;
a drunken husband to her arms.&#xD;
CHAPTER     XIII.&#xD;
When Bridget, the bearer of Mr. Flum-&#xD;
dummery's letter, called on Adalie to deliver&#xD;
it, she found the eyes of the poor girl red&#xD;
with weeping.&#xD;
"Sure, Miss, you feel down-hearted to-day&#xD;
;    wid something or other !"&#xD;
"I am not very well, Brtdget."&#xD;
"The houly angels be wid ye, Miss, ye&#xD;
don't look so. Sure, its being' up so late&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, if ye, had a kind, rich husband, he'd&#xD;
not let ye be after hurtin' yerself so!"&#xD;
Adalie smiled sorrowfully at the remark of&#xD;
the kind-hearted girl, but made no reply.&#xD;
Bridget was troubled, now. She did not&#xD;
know how to break her errand. At last, she&#xD;
said :&#xD;
I've got a letter for ye, Miss'; a letter from&#xD;
a very good gentleman, who is a leetle too full&#xD;
of larnin', but he's good-hearted and rich, as&#xD;
oneself can testify !"&#xD;
" A letter to me, Bridget ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Miss, and' a mighty purity letter it&#xD;
is, too. here it is !"&#xD;
Adalie opened the letter, read it, first&#xD;
smiled, then looked more grave and said :-&#xD;
"You can take a verbal answer, Bridget.--.&#xD;
Say to the gentleman, that I am grateful for&#xD;
his good opinion, but must decline the hohor&#xD;
of his acquaintance,"&#xD;
" Why, Miss; ye'll be after. killin' the&#xD;
poor girtleman. lie's dead gone in love wid&#xD;
you."-&#xD;
"1 cannot help that, Bridget.   He is&#xD;
nothing to me."&#xD;
" But yell write him an answer, jist to&#xD;
console him for his disappointment, won't ye&#xD;
now, Miss Adalie, darlin' ? "&#xD;
" No, Bridget ; I never write to gentle-&#xD;
men.'&#xD;
" Nor meself, be the token that I don't&#xD;
know how, But I pity the gintleran. ie's&#xD;
a good man, barrin' he's a fool wid his&#xD;
science. He goes every night to the theatre&#xD;
to see you dance, and he sighs so mournful&#xD;
like, when-he tao-s to me about you.  I'm&#xD;
afraid ye'll be t:e death o' him, Miss."&#xD;
"No danger ; few men die of love !" said&#xD;
Adalie, laughing at the droll earnestness of&#xD;
the girl.&#xD;
" i've heard o' the like though, Miss.-.&#xD;
Sure, in the ould counthry there weas Barney&#xD;

&#xD;
never married her at all at all. He took itI&#xD;
to heart and never held his head up afterwards,&#xD;
until jist the hour when he died; when he rose'&#xD;
up and axed for Biddy.  And sure enough,&#xD;
the poor crater had jist come home, pale and&#xD;
brokeryhearted, wid a wee baby in her arms&#xD;
-and when Barney saw that, he gived one&#xD;
groan and went off as asy as a lamb in the&#xD;
spring-time.  We gave him   a jolly wake.&#xD;
And poor Biddy, she died too, shortly afther,&#xD;
and the O'Tooles sent the baby up to the&#xD;
landlord's and would'nt own it for their&#xD;
blood !"&#xD;
"Were they buried in one grave ?" said&#xD;
Adalie, abstractedly.&#xD;
"Who, Miss ?"&#xD;
"The-two lovers, my girl!'&#xD;
" Och, no ma'am! Sure and the O'Calla-&#xD;
hans prayed the curse of God on the O'Toole's,&#xD;
for Barney was a promisin' lad. I knew him&#xD;
well, as blithe a boy as ever throd the turf;&#xD;
and could'nt he handle a shilaleh beautiful ?&#xD;
Ah, a nice boy was Barney. If I'd been&#xD;
Biddy O'Toole, no landlord's son should ha&#xD;
come blatherin' around me wid his soft, de-&#xD;
savin' tongue, and pocket full o' gould, if&#xD;
Barney O'Callahan had spoken the word love&#xD;
in my ear."&#xD;
" You are right, Bridget. Virtuous love,&#xD;
even if it is linked with poverty, will render&#xD;
any maiden happier than gilded crime !"&#xD;
S rrue, Miss. Sure, when you spake I&#xD;
think its an angel borrows your tongue for a&#xD;
while, you say so many good things, and say&#xD;
'em so swately."&#xD;
You are a great flattrer, Bridget !" said&#xD;

must decline the honor of his acquaintance !"&#xD;
"Och, how bad he'll feel-and that too,&#xD;
after he gave , me a gould sovereign for&#xD;
bringin' it to y er ladyship."&#xD;
"Never mind; here is a gold dollar for&#xD;
carrying it back."&#xD;
"leaven bless ye, Miss ; ye are always&#xD;
too kind to a poor girl like me."&#xD;
" The poor need kindness more than the&#xD;
rich, Bridget."&#xD;
"I wish everybody else was in your way'&#xD;
o' thinkii', Miss !" said the girl. " What a&#xD;
blessed world wud this be then, sure. Good-&#xD;
bye, Miss ; may the houly angels like ye as&#xD;
well as I do, and keep you from harm."&#xD;
Good-bye, Bridget-i wish you well."&#xD;
" Och, I 'm sure you do, and everybody ,&#xD;
else wid me !" said the honest, warmhearted&#xD;
creature, as she kft the room.&#xD;
' Now, I will w rile to Eugene, and bid&#xD;
him, if he loves me, to hasten to my aid ere&#xD;
it is too late !'' murmured Adalie. '' Yet,"&#xD;
said she, after a pause-" that prophecy&#xD;
The two lovers shall be buic d in one grave.&#xD;
Suppose he comes only to die, and to die for&#xD;
me. Yet it were better we both should die,&#xD;
than I live a being degraded, and he live to&#xD;
know it. I will send for him ; he shall know&#xD;
my danger, and I know he will come. Better&#xD;
that we lay in one grave while loving and&#xD;
pure, than one should live to hate the other.&#xD;
That must not be."&#xD;
The young girl seated herself at the centre&#xD;
table and hastily wrote a letter, which she&#xD;
sealed with a beautiful motto seal, its motto&#xD;
being : "I'll rather die than change." This&#xD;
having directed, she was about to bear to the&#xD;

Adalie, smiling at her nive expression.  office with her own hands, for she dared not&#xD;

Aye, and I repeat it, the curse. " Why&#xD;

Charles Gardner sat alone in his office. It&#xD;
was in the afternoon. Ils face was pale, and&#xD;
ever and anon as he held an open letter in&#xD;
hand, he muttered while he looked upon it,&#xD;
" It cannot be, it cannot be.  Orrin Bird is&#xD;
my friend. Fanny, though 1 have cruelly&#xD;
neglected her, has ever been kind and gentle,&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
Immediately after Bird left Gardner and&#xD;
his wife, he met Malpin. The latter joined&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" Well, Orrin, what luck in love matters ?"&#xD;
he asked.&#xD;
"1 win my prize to-ight !" said the young&#xD;
man. "This nii ht she leaves her husband's&#xD;
house to fly with me. How goes on your&#xD;
miou~r F'&#xD;
"The angel is fallen.  Adalie is already&#xD;
mine !"&#xD;
"cWhat, willingly ?"&#xD;
" No matter how, she is mine ! She will&#xD;
not appear on the stage very soon, I reckon,&#xD;
though. Her mother told the manager this&#xD;
morning that she was sick !"&#xD;
" You pay the doctor's bill, I suppose ?"&#xD;
" Of course with such a prize I can aflord&#xD;
it. But you remember our bet?"&#xD;
" Yes, a supper and all the fixins ! I. will&#xD;
cheerfully pay it, but let it be a week fron&#xD;
to night. I want a week to myself. I expect&#xD;
Gardner will be half crazy when he misses&#xD;
Fanny, and Ithink he suspects me. L shal&#xD;
allow him at least a week to cool off on, and&#xD;
that week I shall spend in consoling Fanny&#xD;
arid reconciling her to her new home !"&#xD;
GYou had better beware, Orrin--Gardner&#xD;
is a desperate man !"&#xD;
"Yes-but I don't fear him. I can be a&#xD;
desperate as he is !"&#xD;
"But he has right on his side! If he shoots&#xD;
you the public will justify and applaud him&#xD;
while if you kill him, every voice will b&#xD;
&#xD;
against you, and would, e 'en if you were&#xD;
innocent of seducing his wife, were that the&#xD;
charge against you!"&#xD;
" True-lI have a great risk to run for my&#xD;
fun-you have none.    Your girl has not&#xD;
even a brother or father to avenge her !"&#xD;
"No, but she has a lover coming out here&#xD;
L expect I shall be called out, but think I can&#xD;
punish him. I'm a pretty fair shot, and I&#xD;
turn my back to no man with the small sword&#xD;
in my hand."&#xD;
" Well, if either of us have to fight, as we&#xD;
know each others secrets, let us each act as&#xD;
the others second."&#xD;
I agree to that, Onrin, but it is my opinion&#xD;
that Gardner, if he finds von out, will not&#xD;
wait for the formalities of a challenge, he&#xD;
will attack you wherever he finds you !'&#xD;
" So much tae better. [ am always armed.&#xD;
I carry a knife that has been used in many a&#xD;
bloody fray. It once belonged to Sam Hous.&#xD;
ton. I shall be cool, he of course will be&#xD;
excited. There will be no danger of my&#xD;
coming out second best."&#xD;
"I hope not, but be careful. A chance&#xD;
shot or blow o4ten kills the bravest man.&#xD;
Look at the caee of po ir Ridgely who after&#xD;

And he had fought three or four duels beside.&#xD;
I don't know why but I feel anxious about&#xD;
your case. It is not exacly a presentiment,&#xD;
yet it is a far for your safety."&#xD;
,  Poh- you'll see it all come out right.&#xD;
I'll be ready for the supper a week from now.&#xD;
Bring your friends along and be there. Now&#xD;

s " By-the-by !"  aid the other. " But, sup.&#xD;

The two young mere entered a fushionable&#xD;

" To the bide !" sold Bird, with a iiie, as&#xD;
he raised his g-ass to his lips.&#xD;
"t To the wile ' rsponded Ma 1pin.&#xD;
Lighting, a cigar each, they regained the&#xD;
street and separated; to meet once more.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIll.&#xD;
It was morning. Adalie sat alone in her&#xD;
room. The door was looked on the outside.&#xD;
She was pale as doth could have made her.&#xD;
Her great black eyr  were cold and lustre-&#xD;
less ; gla sy in ths ir icy glare. 1Her lips&#xD;
were bloodless ; her f;rn;ened rigid and&#xD;
stifT; as it she had b--'-nu traonrmed to stone.&#xD;
Her claspei hands rested on her knees ; her&#xD;
head was slightly bo't d forward. She shed&#xD;
no tear ; she heaved no sigh ; but she looked&#xD;
the image of ckspair.&#xD;
p   The door wan uloited front the ouiide&#xD;
her mother, or the .oman whom  from child.&#xD;
hooi up she had called mother, entered, bear-&#xD;
lug on a salver some coff e anl toast. The&#xD;
girl did not raise her huad. 11er eyes still&#xD;
gazed on vacancy. The woman touched her&#xD;
xi the shoulder and spoke.&#xD;
Adalie .t&#xD;
4She started at the touch, and shuddered as&#xD;
f a slimy serpant had touched her neck.&#xD;
SA dalie ; here is some coffke. Eat ; you&#xD;
vill feel letter if you do!''&#xD;
Adalie looked up, and an expression of&#xD;
ttcr abhorrence, of loathing scorn, Tethered&#xD;
a her face, as she g:zed upon that had&#xD;
roman. Yet she did  ot : pelk.  Volumes&#xD;
e're concentzatcd in that one loo1. iHr eye1&#xD;
II ; she looked at the ali or as it she :ou:htd&#xD;
methimg.&#xD;
"rThere is no knifehere!" said the woman,1&#xD;
ith a smile. " I shall not put temptation in&#xD;
ur way ; you shall live to be happy "&#xD;
"Happy ." cold, cold and bitter was the&#xD;
&#xD;
laugh which rang through that roorm, echoing&#xD;
like l-.ughtor in as.omb.&#xD;
" happy ! Yes, I shall soon be happy.&#xD;
It is written ; the lovers shall both lay in&#xD;
one grave. You need not fear that I. shall&#xD;
kill myselff- I. wait for my Eugene; he comes&#xD;
to avenge i-e, to slay the accursed vilain!&#xD;
Yes, I see him, with anger thironed upon his&#xD;
brow ; 1 see him  hurl 'tho base rmi i-creant&#xD;
down-down to hell . Then angels boar us&#xD;
both away to a happy land -- a happy land&#xD;
where you may never come. No, fe-ar no&#xD;
that I shall commit suicide ; I. must wait for&#xD;
Eugene. Oh ! God, why dd he not come&#xD;
sooner. lie will weep tears of blood that he&#xD;
did not, for he loves me ; I know ho loves&#xD;
me ! But now he will abhor me ! Oh, God,&#xD;
that will hill roe. Yet it was not my fhult&#xD;
it was not my fault. He shall inow all, and&#xD;
then -then I will die. 1 know he will follow&#xD;
when he has slain the villain who has robbed&#xD;
him, robbed me. God's ctu   'e rest on hin&#xD;
and all that he loves on earth !"&#xD;
Passionately as were her words, the tone&#xD;
of' Adaie was cold, bitterly, fr'zingly cold.&#xD;
Uer face was changeless as warble. Never&#xD;
had beauty been so altered.  Now it was as&#xD;
if the sculptor's chiasel had moulde I it, and&#xD;
no life was in it. Oh, msan, man, see thy&#xD;
wreck, b hold thy ruin I"&#xD;
That night was an eventful one in the city.&#xD;
Hundreds who flocked to the theatre to see&#xD;
their favorite danseuse, heard with sorrow,&#xD;
that she was sick.&#xD;
When Gardner returned to his house he&#xD;
found it empty. A note lay upon lie wife's&#xD;
dressing table. It wes sealed and  ddrt'ossed&#xD;
to him, lie broke it opetn, and rr 1:l with&#xD;
agony as the terrible truth broke upon himit.&#xD;
When doubting her fidelity, merely droubtrn&#xD;
it, he had been driven almost to insanity.&#xD;
But now the doubts were realized. 1r note&#xD;
was brief, but it was to the point.&#xD;
"CIALES      oc-I Once loved your-i love you&#xD;
&#xD;

no more. Seek me0 not, I on u here I enm&#xD;

" Is she lost foeer ! Fanny, Fang-y , it was&#xD;

he a refoirmed mn 1"&#xD;
She heard him not. She was away in the&#xD;
arms of another a lost and ruined wife, a&#xD;
victim to th  tudied arts of seduction.&#xD;
For hours that wretched man paced to and&#xD;
fro in his room, at times cursing the hour&#xD;
ho was born, then ravig against her, then&#xD;
cursint with fearful im recations the name&#xD;
of' Bird, for he had not a doubt that he had&#xD;

CIIAIPTER XIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
Another day rolled on. G rdnar called&#xD;
early a t the office of Bird, and asked for&#xD;
him. He received for reply that he had&#xD;
gone into the country on business that morn&#xD;
ing, and they did not know how soon lie would&#xD;
be back.-probably in a week.  He called at&#xD;
his resnidence, and received the same answer&#xD;
there. Calmly, but steadily he pursued his&#xD;
search. Cautiously wording his enquiries,&#xD;
he endeavored to trace* the fugitives, but&#xD;
without avail. His friends could see an&#xD;
alteration in his manner, but when questioned&#xD;
he only pleaded illness- he told no one of his&#xD;
&#xD;
wrongs, spoke to no one of his determinations.&#xD;
Eeven the domestics in his house were told&#xD;
that their mistress had gone out of town for a&#xD;
few days. All outwitted excepting the Yan-&#xD;
kee Reporter from whose pen the following&#xD;
article emanated on the second day.&#xD;
' CRIME CON. IN JUGIL LIFE.&#xD;
"It is rumored that tholovely wife of one&#xD;
of our most respectable meichar.ts has va-&#xD;
mosed with a young lawyer of weathh and&#xD;
high standing in this city.  Whither the&#xD;
birds have flown no one as yet knows, but&#xD;
'ore long they doubtless will be discovered&#xD;
&#xD;
by some gardner expert in finding bird&#xD;
ne-sts."&#xD;
Now the said reporter thought this was&#xD;
excessively witty, but he trembled in his&#xD;
booteco when he was confronted by Gardner&#xD;
in the evening, who held a big stick in his&#xD;
hand and requested the pleasure of five min-&#xD;
utes private conversation with him.&#xD;
"Can't you say what you have to say here,&#xD;
sir ?' said the reporter, glancing from Gard-&#xD;
nors pale face down to the stick in his hand._&#xD;
"No sir. You needn't fear me. L.'1l do&#xD;
no harm--I only want to know how you be-&#xD;
came informed of the matter alluded to in&#xD;
your city item column of the paper this&#xD;
morn inrg."&#xD;
" Oh ! ab ! accident, mere accident sir.&#xD;
You see I'm always around. I heard Bird&#xD;
say he'd seduce the lady, some time ago. I&#xD;
saw him  buy a ring at Guions for $500.&#xD;
He said he'd ruin you and get her !"&#xD;
The ruined man and wretched husband&#xD;
groaned aloud, forgetting that he had asked&#xD;
a private interview, and they were still in&#xD;
the street.&#xD;
" I saw him night before last with Mal-&#xD;
pim, and  heard them say  they had a bet&#xD;
to settle--they are to have a supper  at&#xD;
the      a week from that. night !&#xD;
"Are they'?  Thank God I"&#xD;
"There'll be the place.. I'll have items&#xD;
then sure-will be eergain to be there !"&#xD;
muttered the delighted repot ter inaudibly.&#xD;
Gardner paused a erooment.    Do you&#xD;
knov where they now are ?" he asked.&#xD;
"No sir -Guess I can find out if any-&#xD;
body can, though I&#xD;
Do so and I will give you a hundred dol-&#xD;
lars. There are twenTy tr expenses now.&#xD;
But why did you not tell ;n before ?"&#xD;
" I did -I- wrote you a letter !_&#xD;
"You wrote that letter r gncd A FtIENP "&#xD;
SI did."&#xD;
&#xD;
"It came too late. They fled the very&#xD;
night I received it !"&#xD;
I ctculated as much !"&#xD;
" My God! why did you not come to me&#xD;
and tell me all you knew."&#xD;
"It would have been out of the way of&#xD;
business and would have spoiled an item.&#xD;
Besides Mr. Bird carries a kife and I don't&#xD;
like knives-dot think its a comfortable&#xD;
way of dying, don't what to be made an item&#xD;
of myself at any rate ."&#xD;
"Yes he cariies a knife-is called a fight-&#xD;
ing man !" muttered Gardener fiercely. But&#xD;
I'll see if it can protect him !"&#xD;
" Don't talk in that way before me, Mr.&#xD;
Gardener-- I might be called on as a wit-&#xD;
ness you know !"&#xD;
" Then clear out and don't stand listening&#xD;
to me !"&#xD;
" If I. don't look and listen I'd never get an&#xD;
item," muttered the reporter as he walked otT&#xD;
" I'll look on Wednesdav night I guess--look&#xD;
in at that supper I reckon. I wonder what&#xD;
the bet was about. That's an !em, must find&#xD;
out! But here's a twenty--by hokee I'll&#xD;
have a supper, as is. a supper. here goes&#xD;
for Holbrooks."&#xD;

After, Bridget had received her message&#xD;
from Adalie for Mr. Flumdummery, she&#xD;
hestened to that gentleman to deliver it. As&#xD;
she had predicted, he took it "hard."&#xD;

Where was Eugene Beverly all this time.&#xD;
coming down with all the speed that one of&#xD;
the fastest boats on the Western rivers pos-&#xD;
sessed. He was rapidly nearing New Or'&#xD;
leans, visiting it for the first time. With the&#xD;
eye of a lover of the grand in nature, he gsz-&#xD;
ed upon the broad rushing waters of the&#xD;
mighty river, swollen banks full-upon the&#xD;
vast forests here and there-the neat plant&#xD;
tions along the shore scarce attracting his eye&#xD;
at all. The hand of man defaces nature to&#xD;
the poet's eye. He would see the world as&#xD;
God made it-not as man improves (?) it.&#xD;
Oh for me there is nothing like the mountain&#xD;
crags-the shadowy wildwood-the sylvan&#xD;
lake-the foaming torrent-the mighty cata-&#xD;
ract-the sublime ocean. These are as the&#xD;
Almighty framed them, stupendous, beautiful,&#xD;
perfect.&#xD;
i~&#xD;
Where were Orrin Bird and the lovely, no&#xD;
longer skinless Fanny?  We will see them.&#xD;
F. .&#xD;
In a small neat cottage right in the heart of&#xD;
the city, attended by a faithful servant of&#xD;
Bird's, they had passel the hours of guilty&#xD;
happiness which had intervened after the&#xD;
flight from her once happy home.&#xD;
Here, on the morning of the day when&#xD;
Bird was to give the supper to Malpin, they&#xD;
were seated side by side, still loving, for pos-&#xD;
session had not yet cloyed the heart of Bird.&#xD;
He had just told her of his intention to pass&#xD;
the evening out. He had not been absent&#xD;
from her a moment before since their flight.&#xD;
"Oh, do not go, my only love !" she said&#xD;
- I  pleadingly. "I fear you will meet him."&#xD;
* T"''here is little danger--if I do, I do not&#xD;
fear him!"                .&#xD;

kill you. Oh Orrin, I should die, if you&#xD;
were to be taken from me. Life would not&#xD;
be worth keeping now without you.&#xD;
"Bless you Fanny-you are an angel. If&#xD;
1 should fall would you revenge me&#xD;
" Yes, by my fond love, I swear I would !"&#xD;
" On himr?'"&#xD;
"Yes on any one. Oh O:rin, such love as&#xD;
mine is rnadneso !"&#xD;
"God grant such madness may continue&#xD;
then, swotest. But do not be fearful--I will,&#xD;
for your save, be very cautious--had I not&#xD;
made a positive engagement, I should not&#xD;
noW go. I hate to leave you for an instant.&#xD;
L shall not enjoy myself away from you.&#xD;
Every place apart from you is a desert to me&#xD;
now. I have never known happiness be-&#xD;
fore."&#xD;
"And now-oh shall we always be so hap-.&#xD;
py, Orrin :u"&#xD;
"Always, love, always."&#xD;
God grant it !" murmured the lovely sin-&#xD;
ner, as she drooped her beautiful head upon&#xD;
his shoulder, and their lips again met in the&#xD;
long, sweet, passionate kisses of unsatiated&#xD;
love.&#xD;
Here we will leave them, but to meet them&#xD;
again, though not as now. The sun seldom&#xD;
shines long on the path of crime, clouds were&#xD;
already hovering in their horrizon, tinged&#xD;
with blood-red.&#xD;
CHAPTER XX[.&#xD;
It was evening. Our drama is drawing to&#xD;
a finale. Eugene Beverly was already in&#xD;
sight of the city which contained the ideal of&#xD;
all his fancies, the angel of his dreams. Ah&#xD;
how bright were his hopes. Little did he&#xD;
dream that ruin baad already darkened over&#xD;
the temp e of his love. He had her address&#xD;
in an hour more he expected to be clasped&#xD;
&#xD;
57&#xD;
&#xD;
to the virgin boso-n of her whom he loved.&#xD;
Fearful indeed was to be his disappointment.&#xD;
Where was Charles Gardener. Lurking&#xD;
near the Verandah watching the out going&#xD;
and incoming of every visitor. He was cali&#xD;
.--calm as a statue and full as pale. his&#xD;
right hand rested on the hilt of a broad-bladed&#xD;
knife. His left ever and anon touched the&#xD;
handle of a colts revolver, which rested in a&#xD;
belt beneath his loose sackcoat. Suddenly'&#xD;
man approached him.&#xD;
"1've found out all, Mr. Gardener !"&#xD;
It was our Yankee reporter.&#xD;
" Well ?"&#xD;
"1 know what the bet of the supper was&#xD;
for,  Malpin bet fied he would succeed in&#xD;
seducing the danseuse Mam'selle Adalie be-&#xD;
fore Bird had seduced Mrs. G. Ilhe bet&#xD;
was a supper, it is to take place to-night !"&#xD;
" A nice supper it will be for one I"&#xD;
' Theyare to meet at the Verandah at&#xD;
,1 know it."&#xD;
"They go to the supper room at te !"&#xD;
"I know that too!"&#xD;
"I shall be there.  I worked myself into&#xD;
a n invitation I"&#xD;
Well--I shall be there, at the right&#xD;
time without an mvitation.   But as you&#xD;
value life, not a word from your lips.  No&#xD;
warning."&#xD;
" Do you think I'd spoil an item ?" asked&#xD;
ethe reporter in surprise. " No Sir ! I shall&#xD;
be there to see all the fun. Got a iiew note,&#xD;
book on purpose! I io Sir-never fear, I shall&#xD;
never spoil an item. It's not in the way of,&#xD;
fbusir'nes i S. r !"&#xD;
" Weil.-'vemore work     fir you.   Aj&#xD;
young man is expected hero to-night to see&#xD;
j this victim  of Malpins-Adalie.   He will&#xD;
arrive, or has arrived by this time. Go -o&#xD;
j her house and leave word where Malpin is&#xD;
to-night. There may be more than one hand&#xD;
of revenge there !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"More items, eh ?" and the reporter rub-&#xD;
bed his hands in glee at the anticipation of a&#xD;
perfect harvest. "But how'll I kn.ow this&#xD;
man ?"&#xD;
"No rnatter--write a note, directed to her,&#xD;
and state what the supper is given for."&#xD;
I see !-i'lIl do it of course. Sign it " a&#xD;
friend" too. But you've never asked where&#xD;
Mrs. G. lives. I've fournd that out !"&#xD;
" Right-where is it ?  After I am done&#xD;
with him, her turn comes&#xD;
"Anot her item--he-d "HORRIBLE,"mut-s&#xD;
tered the reporter to himself. Then reply-&#xD;
ing to the question, he said&#xD;
" In a neat cottage at the corner of Conti&#xD;
and Treme !&#xD;
" It is well.  There are your hundred&#xD;
dollars. You have earned them. Now keep&#xD;
what you know, to yourself, and do as I bade&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
Certainly, I will. By hokee but I'll&#xD;
have lots oi items for to-morrow's paper. I'll&#xD;
be a mile ahead of the rest of the boys."&#xD;
They separated. One to remain on his&#xD;
vigil of revenge-the other to warn another&#xD;
actor in our drama, that it was time for him&#xD;
to come on the stage. Talking of the stage,&#xD;
it will be easy for us now to arrange the rest&#xD;
of our novel as scenes in the last act of a ter-&#xD;
rible drama. And so we will do.&#xD;
SCENE FIRST.&#xD;
Adalie in her chamber--not as we saw&#xD;
her first, blooming in health and beauty, but&#xD;
pale, thin-looking as if death's seal was&#xD;
already stamped upon 'her brow, her lonely&#xD;
form stretched along her couch like a wilted&#xD;
lower on its bed. The hour was early eve-.&#xD;
ning. She held an evening Delta in her hand.&#xD;

Eugene. I am no longer worthy of you,&#xD;
but you will avenge my death !"&#xD;
As she said this, she glneed at a small&#xD;
vial nbeh see hcld close clinched in her&#xD;
left hand. It contzincd that deadliest of poi-&#xD;
ons, which has to antidote, " corrosive subli&#xD;
mute.'  She couti'ed the moments.  Sod&#xD;
denly she heard a rnug at the bell.&#xD;
, It is he ! she screamed, " mother deny&#xD;
him not, for I am dying -'&#xD;
"It is only a letter, child !" said the terri-&#xD;
fled woman, terrified at her own work now&#xD;
that it is toe late.&#xD;
Dying, she said, there's another item ."&#xD;
said the man who handed in the letter, as he&#xD;
turned away.&#xD;
She opened the letter. "It is well !" she&#xD;
cried after she rend it--" this will be good&#xD;
news for Eugene !&#xD;
The next moment a quick, hurried ring&#xD;
was heard at the door.&#xD;
T his is he I this is he . she screamed--&#xD;
and fainted.&#xD;
" It was .!when she came too, his arms&#xD;
were around her slender form--his kisses on&#xD;
her lips, his low soft tones were breathing&#xD;
kindness in her care.&#xD;
'-O; thank God, you have come-but it is&#xD;
too late " she marned with a shudder.&#xD;
" My blessed Adale, my own one, what&#xD;
do you mean ? Speak -oh Iheavens !-speatk!"&#xD;
" Look there ! ask my mother ." she cried.&#xD;
Beverly turn d, and quick as thought she&#xD;
swallowed the con eats of the phial and dash-&#xD;
ed it across the room.&#xD;
" It is done--I have seen you-kiased youl&#xD;
I am not worthy to live for you Eugene, I&#xD;
will lie for you. In that letter ace the name&#xD;
of him who in my slep, a sleep procured by&#xD;
drugs despoiled me ot my inUocence. Go to&#xD;
that supper and aveot e me I"&#xD;
" My God, what have you done ! oh Adalie&#xD;
I love you not the lea;t. You are skinless !"&#xD;
"In heart I am-and di ypours Eugene!&#xD;
&#xD;
1 have taken poison, my life can only count&#xD;
minutes now. Oh God     less you, we will&#xD;
soon be united. The Sy bil sail so !,&#xD;
Eugene Beverly took the letter, glnced it&#xD;
over, and a strange expression cro'sed his&#xD;
thee as he read it. H-e put it in his bosom,&#xD;
then turned to poor Adalie, who wo already&#xD;
sufleriog the torments of the poiston. 1Her&#xD;
wretched mother knelt, terror stricken, by the&#xD;
side of the bed--she knew that there was no&#xD;
help.&#xD;
" Oh bless you Eugene-you know not&#xD;
how 1 have loved you.' mooned to dyg i&#xD;
girl. " One kiss, one kind word, and 1 die&#xD;
happy.  You, you are near me. Hold my&#xD;
hand !"&#xD;
" Oh God, this is terrible !" moaned the&#xD;
lover, the almost widowed lover.&#xD;
The mother could not stand it.  With her&#xD;
hands ccenched across her bring brows, she&#xD;
fled from the room and fromfthe house,, fled&#xD;
to seek her comrade in crime, the seducer of&#xD;

In a few moments all wai over.  Adalie' s&#xD;
last word was her lover's name--her last&#xD;
sigh breathed upon his lips, her e'yes were&#xD;
glazed in death whild looking at hm.&#xD;
She was dead.  He crossed her pale hands&#xD;
upon her bosom, decently arranged her beau.&#xD;
tiful limbs, then agpin glancing at the letter,&#xD;
strode forth, pale and determined, in look and&#xD;
and in step.&#xD;
SCENE SECOND.&#xD;
A supper room gaily lighted. The hour&#xD;
ten-servanits bearig in a splendid repast.&#xD;
The guests arrive. The   Colonel' is.there,&#xD;
so is the '6Mejor'-so aye a dozen riore of&#xD;
the bloods of the city. Orrin Bird takes the&#xD;
head of the table--Malpin the foot. Ii a mn-&#xD;

The h ast has hr'n. The guests are do-&#xD;
lighted. It process. The wine bottles pass&#xD;
freely. Jest after jest is uttered. Finally&#xD;
Malpin is called on for a toast. Glancing&#xD;
archly at Bird, he cries&#xD;
c'I hive as a toast, our Bet, and the fair&#xD;
subjects of it I"&#xD;
" The Bet, the'Bet !" cried several voices&#xD;
what was it, who won it ?"&#xD;
"I am here to claim forfeit !" cried a daep&#xD;
hoarse voice at the dpos, and Charles Gard-&#xD;
ner was seen to enter.&#xD;
The Reporter took out his note books-Bird&#xD;
drew a pistol from his breast and cocked it.&#xD;
" The bet gentlemen," continued Gardner,&#xD;
slowly advancing, while every eye was fixed&#xD;
on his pale stern face,-" was the seduction&#xD;
of my wife, and, Orrin Bird, I am here to&#xD;
claim forteit !"&#xD;
' "Advance one step und L. fire ! " cried&#xD;
bird.&#xD;
Gardner made no reply. Bird's hand trem-&#xD;
bled, but he took deliberote aim at the man&#xD;
who walked so steadily, so slowly, so fear-&#xD;
lessly toward him. No one dared to stir-&#xD;
they scarcely breathed--they felt that this&#xD;
was a combat in which they ought not to in-&#xD;
terfere.&#xD;
" Halt, or you die !" cried Bird.&#xD;
Gardner still advanced...he was almost in&#xD;
reach of his antagonist. Bird pulled the trig-&#xD;
ger. Te percussion cap failed to explode.&#xD;
quick as thought he thrust his hand within&#xD;
his vast for his knife, but he was too late.&#xD;
Gardner leaped like a hungered tiger upon&#xD;
him, and crc he could even speak, the broad&#xD;
knife was buried to the hilt in his breast.&#xD;
"Oh Fanny !" he groaned, and fell back&#xD;
dead on the floor.&#xD;
Arrest the murderer !" shouted Malpin.&#xD;
A dozen sprang forward to seize Gar dner,&#xD;
but he made no resistance.&#xD;
S      "I surrender!"r he said.  "I have done&#xD;

"Cursed murderer !" cried Malpin-"ho&#xD;

"Call no man murderer but yourself!"&#xD;
said a low voice at his side.&#xD;
"Who are you, sir ?" he cried, as }ie turn&#xD;
ed and saw a stranger by his side.&#xD;
"Eugene Beverley, come to tell you that&#xD;
your victim is dead-and I am here to avenge&#xD;
her !"&#xD;
" Dead?    Adaluj de Bouligny - dead ?"&#xD;
gasped the astonished man,  "I did not mean&#xD;
her harm !"&#xD;
" Liar, tale that !" and as he spoke Bever..&#xD;
ly struck him with the back of his hand in&#xD;
his face.&#xD;
"I am not armed-l will not fight here !"&#xD;
cried Malpiu. " ilood enough has been&#xD;

" On one condition, I will not 1"&#xD;

" And I go to attend to your victim, nur;&#xD;

"So be it.'&#xD;
" Another item; a duel on the tapis; I&#xD;

been chosen for the spot, and often has it b.en&#xD;
used for like purposes. The weap ns were&#xD;
small swords. With only the surgeon and&#xD;
three or four witnsses, (the reporter  a-&#xD;
there, no one knew how he was admitted)&#xD;
the combatants made their final preparations.&#xD;
The swords were long, thin rapiers. Etch&#xD;
second held a similar weapon. Malpin was&#xD;
cool and collected ; he seemed to value the&#xD;
life he was to fight for. But Beverley was&#xD;
flushed and feverish ; he had watched all&#xD;
night by the dead body of her whom he loved&#xD;
more than all else on %arth. Yet, his look&#xD;
was firm and determined : he looked the hate&#xD;
which filled his soul, when he gazed upon the&#xD;
victimizer before htrm.&#xD;
They were stripped to their waits ; leav-&#xD;
only their shirts between their breasts and the&#xD;
death.baring blades. They were placed in&#xD;
position ; the keen weapons put in .their&#xD;
hands. The salute was gravely given; the&#xD;
word commence followed.&#xD;
Then came the struggle for lif and death.&#xD;
Swift as linked lightning when the storm.&#xD;
clouds clash in heaven were their bright&#xD;
blades mingling. Parry and thrust-thrust&#xD;
and parry-each met the other. Suddenly&#xD;
the sword flew from the hand of lBeverly-&#xD;
He stood disarm-d before his foe. Calmly he&#xD;
folded his arms. lie did not seek to regain&#xD;
his weapon.&#xD;
"Strike!F' he cried-" strike and send me&#xD;
to join your victim, muderer !'&#xD;
" Give him his weapon. I will not strike&#xD;
a disarmed foe !" said the other.&#xD;
Beverly smiled when he again received&#xD;
his weapon-a bitte smile it was, one that&#xD;
bade his foe beware.   When again they&#xD;
crossed their weapons Beaverly pressed mad-&#xD;
ly on Malpin, and drove hint nearly across&#xD;
the room. With a heavy cut he beat down&#xD;
his guard-he made a furious plunge at his&#xD;
breast--but it grazed Malpins side, and the&#xD;
sword of the latter was the next moment bu-&#xD;
&#xD;
ried to the very hilt in the body of the&#xD;
wretched man.&#xD;
'B ry menin the same grave with Adalie!"&#xD;
he faintly murmured, " and died !"&#xD;
" God forgive me-I nver shall forgive&#xD;
myself !" groaned Malpin as he knelt by the&#xD;
side of his second victim. Bat he heard the&#xD;
tars words of the dy tog nan, and ont the next&#xD;
day "two lovers were buried in one grave."&#xD;
SCENE FOUR FH.&#xD;
Reader-You have gazed on the second&#xD;
eeae of my tablaux U-and a fearful picture&#xD;
have you seen. I lft you there gazing on&#xD;
the dead body of Orrin Bird. Charles Gard-&#xD;
ter, after committing the deed, gazed with a&#xD;
look of calm satisfaction on the corse of his&#xD;
victim. They who had rushed forward to&#xD;
arrest him for his crime found no opposition-&#xD;
no resistance from him,.&#xD;
"I have killed the seducer of my wife"-&#xD;
he said,- " let the law take its course !"&#xD;
lie surrendered, and was detained until&#xD;
Fhe Coroner could summon a jury. This&#xD;
took-nearly two hours. In the meantime,&#xD;
whether it was through the instrumentality&#xD;
of the Yankee Reporter of the Picayune or&#xD;
others, I know not, Fanny Gaidner had heard&#xD;
of the deed of blood. nd, when at the still&#xD;
hour of midnight they had assembled to give&#xD;
a verdict, 'while under oath they gazed upon&#xD;
his clady remains, she was flying towards&#xD;
the spot.&#xD;
Their deliberations were concluded. The&#xD;
proof was satisfactory. Their verdict was:&#xD;
" Orrin Bird has come to his death by the&#xD;
hinds of Charles Gardner in an affray, on&#xD;
the evening of      the --th, 1851.  We&#xD;
return a verdict of WILFUL MURDER."&#xD;
The coroner on hearing this verdict, called&#xD;
tpon Mr. Howard, a well known and efli-&#xD;
cent officer of the Parish Prison, to take&#xD;
charge of the accused. But while yet the&#xD;

&#xD;
O? NEW ORLEANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
voice of the coroner echoed through his hall-&#xD;
'ere the words of the foreman had ceased to&#xD;
vibrate upon the ear of the excited listeners,&#xD;
a shrill, wild shriek, like the cry of a woun-&#xD;
ded panther, was heard. The next moment.&#xD;
with garments flowing, hair disheve-lled, and&#xD;
eyes flashing fire, Fanny Gardner rushed&#xD;
into the room.&#xD;
" Were is he? where is he ?" she shriek.&#xD;
ed.&#xD;
"Your husband is here Madam !" said the&#xD;
coroner.&#xD;
"My husband ! What husband?" The mur-&#xD;
derer of my own heaven-wedded..&#xD;
".Orrin ? Show me Orrin-he is not dead&#xD;
-let me see him !"&#xD;
Pasing her husband, who stood pale and&#xD;
trembling  near the corse of the sed icer,&#xD;
she looked one moment upon the body, t en,&#xD;
weeping like a suffering child, she fell up n&#xD;
him and kissed his clay-cold lips.&#xD;
No one dared to interrupt her sinful, but&#xD;
natural grief. No one attempted to lift her&#xD;
up. No one interfered with her criminal,&#xD;
yet heart-felt sorrow. For a few moments&#xD;
she thus wept upon the bosom of the dead.&#xD;
Then she arose. She gazed around her room&#xD;
with her flashing eyes as if she sought some&#xD;
one to blast with a glance. He, (Charles&#xD;
Gardner,) shrunk-shrunk down as if he&#xD;
wished the earth to open and hide him. Yet,&#xD;
as her graceful form towered above the rest,&#xD;
she saw the shrinking man.&#xD;
".Charles !' she cried in a deep, piercing&#xD;
tone, "Charles my eye is on you. You are&#xD;
a murderer, and I have sworn to avenge him!&#xD;
lie loved me-( loved him, you must die !"&#xD;
"Fanny-Fanny,"     he  replied-" speak&#xD;
not of vengeance! I have only slain your se-&#xD;
ducer !"&#xD;
"ilMy seducer I" Oh how sneering and hit-&#xD;
ter were both words and tone as she spoke.&#xD;
"My seducer !" she reiterated. "Murderer,&#xD;
if I have been seduced, it was your fatlt,you&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
preferred the gambling table, and the har.&#xD;
room to our home-vou chose to neglect me&#xD;
who loved you nore than life-you imtroduced&#xD;
me to him whom you have slain, and I loved&#xD;
him ! That if I did so, was your own fault.&#xD;
You neglected-he seemed to adore me.&#xD;
When I f und that ny heart was not valued&#xD;
by you, I gave it to him. 1 gave it vluti.&#xD;
tarily--heodid not seduce me, I encouroged&#xD;
him. lie was not to blame, I only amt at&#xD;

bosom which has piliwed your head in faith.&#xD;
ful days.  Pierce it with your assassin&#xD;
steel !"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
As she spoke she   tore apart the thin K&#xD;
co ring which hid her charms from view.&#xD;
anny," cried the murderer, "oFnnv, I&#xD;
am nut in fault -.I loved you,[ have revenged&#xD;
the lo, s of your honor !"         -&#xD;
"M   hono . Charles Gardner what cared&#xD;
you for my honor when I was left to pine in&#xD;
solitude when you wasted your subs'er ce at.&#xD;
the gaming table. Speak to me now of hon.&#xD;
or. You ire a murderer. The law   ittj.us-&#xD;
tify you. You will be acquitted   by the&#xD;
Grand Jury without a trial. You will be jus-&#xD;
ified by the people, who do not, as I do know&#xD;
you. Yet you shall riot be free. Omriti shall-&#xD;
not be unavenged. On the very mrrig of&#xD;
the day when you slew him, 1 vowed= if h&amp;amp;&#xD;
came to harm at your hands to avenge him. I&#xD;
will do so. Beware of me. He, and he only&#xD;
was my true husband, for when I was fmced&#xD;

warning. I have sworn, by the love which I&#xD;
bore to him never to rest till he is reveuged,&#xD;
and I too am revenged. Go forth, Charles&#xD;
Gardner-go to be tried for this crimr- they&#xD;
will acquit you-I will not. When they have&#xD;
discharged youthen I will fulfill my vow.&#xD;
Hearken. I will be your deat/h I"&#xD;
She said no more. Like a trembling cul-&#xD;
prit as he was, he stood and heard her words.&#xD;

She oe-r left the body of por Bird until&#xD;
it Vas  iin the earth. W nen that was done,&#xD;
she soi :&#xD;
" T,; ,Est sacred duty is over, I now go&#xD;
to ave.r thim whom I loved !"&#xD;
Fany Gardner's voice was never heard&#xD;
after it}  night in the city of New Orleans.&#xD;
Aft-: (harles had heard her threats, know-&#xD;
ing bi a- he did, and supposing that Bird&#xD;
had fri ;..Is who might revenge his death, he&#xD;
felt the to was not safe in those latitudes-&#xD;
So fees he looked with the eye of thought&#xD;
for aomta- other sphere of action. A new field&#xD;
of action was at that moment opening. Cuba&#xD;
and her wrongs was laid like a map before&#xD;
him. A land where the people were rushed&#xD;
by the  i- -pot's iron heel-a soil stained with&#xD;
the blo -of those who had cfilered up their&#xD;
livEs in it cedom's causes, was before him, and&#xD;
knowi: Â¢ a few of those who, for -God, Liberty&#xD;
and L =p," would a ise the banner and&#xD;
draw t   steel he volunteered.&#xD;
Wit a chosen few he sailed in the " Ada,"&#xD;
a Balti ore built schooner. There were but&#xD;
50 me a hoard, but each was a man. Harry&#xD;
Robin   had charge of them. He gave him&#xD;
the po :i-en of a first lieutenant, and to him&#xD;
confide i all his secrecies. His was destined&#xD;
to act e a tore-runner, or advance band who&#xD;
f were to be scattered at different points on&#xD;
the Cury-n coast to meet well known patriots&#xD;
there, and in concert with them to prepare&#xD;
forthe Lttding of the larger bodies which mere&#xD;
follow.  lie himself was to land near Puerto&#xD;
Princip, arrange with a lare body in that&#xD;
region. to strike the first blow for Indepen-&#xD;
dence, aise the free flag ofCuba and call for&#xD;
aid from those who love the cause of freedom&#xD;
every" here -the brave, true-hearted Soon  o&#xD;
America. Tphe plan was well arranged-&#xD;
confided to a man well fitted to carry it out.&#xD;
The navigation of the craft was under&#xD;
charge of a man who was as capable as any&#xD;
officer who ever trod a deck or drew a sword.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ton (leawline, (a near relative of " our Char&#xD;
ley's') had srveh in the Patriot service in&#xD;
S luth America, and knew how to handle his&#xD;
craft and to fight her too if it becean: neces-&#xD;
sary, though the Ada wa; not built as a war&#xD;
vessel--speed having been more consulted&#xD;
than weight or strength.  When the Ada&#xD;
left New Oleans, it was the dead hour of&#xD;
night. She was towed down to the Bdize by&#xD;
a steamr engaged expressly for the occasion,&#xD;
and before dawn was far outsi In of observ.&#xD;
ing eyes.   And little did Charls Gardner&#xD;
think that when he left he was v atched by&#xD;
eyes which once beaming only to give him&#xD;
pleasure, now gleamed with the deadly fire&#xD;
of hate, the ever-burning light of revenge-&#xD;
unsatiated revenge.&#xD;
After he had been discharged by the Jury,&#xD;
as she predict d, she had never lost sight of&#xD;
his movements. Through paid spies and other&#xD;
means she learned his destination, the duties&#xD;
which were confided to him and even the&#xD;
names of his comrades.  At one time, dress-&#xD;
ed as a boy she even visited the vessel to try&#xD;
and go in it. It was night, her sex was not&#xD;
discovered, but the commander said he wanted&#xD;
" no children on board," and the application&#xD;
was refused.&#xD;
But one of the New York steam packets&#xD;
was to sail in the morning for havana and&#xD;
this suited her purpose well, for a full pur-&#xD;
pose of revenge had already entered her&#xD;
heated brain.  And close upon the heels of&#xD;
the schooner, following in her wake, the no-&#xD;
ble steamer dashed in a few hours afterward,&#xD;
Tihe run from New Orleans to Havana, or&#xD;
to the Cuban Isle, seldom to a fist veesel with&#xD;
a fair  id, or to a steamer, occupies mre&#xD;
than 48 or 50 hours, and in this case, though&#xD;
the wind was light, only 50 hours had passed&#xD;
ere the heights of Mariel were in view from&#xD;
the deck of the Ada. At the same time, a&#xD;
few miles in her rear a steamer could be seen&#xD;
rapidly coming down the gulf. Many were&#xD;
&#xD;
the conj'ctures, and some the fears, a. to what&#xD;
she would turn out to be, or whether she would&#xD;
overhaul the Ada before night could close in&#xD;
and conceal her motion. But as Rohinson&#xD;
and Clew line could conceal their men and&#xD;
arms below and had an American Register&#xD;
and clearane . t board, they hoped even if i&#xD;
should turn out tO be a Spanish cruiser, to&#xD;
evade her acrutinv.&#xD;
As night approached, the wine died away.&#xD;
leaving the litle clipper becalmed close un-&#xD;
der the frowning cliffs of Mariel, not far&#xD;
from Bahieat Honda, where they intended to&#xD;
land their first party early enough to leave&#xD;
and pass havana on their way east long be-&#xD;
fore day light.--&#xD;
Meantime the strange steamer rapidly ap-&#xD;
proached, and it was with joy that the eyes&#xD;
of the tew ho remained above decks on tb&#xD;
schooner recognized the flags of the Ameri&#xD;
can mail steamship Ohio-comnmanded too&#xD;
by one who once before on board ofthe Mex-&#xD;
ican Patriot brig Guerrero, near that very&#xD;
spot, gave the Spanish cowards a taste of'&#xD;
American prowees which they could not ear ily&#xD;
forget.&#xD;
On, on se came, close alongside the now&#xD;
becalmed achoon'r, Ont the deck of the lat-&#xD;
ter vessel, dr ssed like a merchant sailor,&#xD;
with two or three others only, stood Charles&#xD;
Gardeter gazing upi the other craft.&#xD;
Quick is the eye of love, but quicker than&#xD;
&#xD;
the lightning's fi4sh and piecing as the war-&#xD;
rious mteel is the glance of hate. While&#xD;
Gardener glanced carelessly on the group of&#xD;
passengers who stood en the ship, he heard&#xD;
a shrill voice utter his own name.&#xD;
" Charles Gardener we will meet in Cuba.&#xD;
Death awaits you there !"&#xD;
He turned pale-he slhuddered--he recog-&#xD;
nized in that threatening voice in that out-&#xD;
stretched and menacing arm, the wife once&#xD;
loved, the woman now vowed to revenge!&#xD;
The rteamer swept on, foi Iavanna was&#xD;
&#xD;
t-ith in wo hours sail, and as the sun sank&#xD;
redly in the wt, ,igns of a storm  which&#xD;
woul Mfellow the calm began rapidly to show&#xD;
themselves.&#xD;
Lve you ever seen a rtorm, a good heavy&#xD;
s'orm rite as quick as anger on a high tern.&#xD;
pered woman's face ? It is qiit j as interest-&#xD;
Ong, but a little more dangerous. On this&#xD;
occasion the sun de' eended lizily in a reddish&#xD;
murky cloud -while the eir\ beaem-n close&#xD;
and stifling more so than it had been in the&#xD;
hot noon day. By the time the sun was hid-&#xD;
den in the west a thick line of bleaky horizon.&#xD;
tal clouds arose in the north east and rapidly&#xD;
moved-up toward the zenith, followed by rag,&#xD;
ged messengers of the gale flying like scared&#xD;
spectres in their wake.&#xD;
The shy, but late so clear, became over-&#xD;
spread in a brief time, and even a landsman&#xD;
could have foreseen that a gale was brewing&#xD;
--not one of your cool, w ll made deliberate&#xD;
stormes that warns you in time for prepara-&#xD;
tion. but one of those hurry-scurry drunken&#xD;
devils called "hurricanes" in west 'Indian&#xD;
latitudes,&#xD;
" We're going to have a rouser !" mutter--&#xD;
ed Clewlitc, as he unwillingly gave orders&#xD;
to furl everything but his foresail which he&#xD;
close.retf d, so as to work her head ff shore&#xD;
when the gale struck her. Though there&#xD;
was not a breath of wind now, a long heavy&#xD;
swell began to roll in toward the land and to&#xD;
meet it, he had sweeps got out and pointed his&#xD;
prow to the northward. But the sweeps were&#xD;
not needed. The roar of the blast came boom-&#xD;
ing over the de p,then while the sail first filled&#xD;
with its breath, the schooner gathered head.&#xD;
way, It was well she did, for the next mo-&#xD;
ment a blast came which, had it struck her&#xD;
on her beam, would have capsized her, or&#xD;
have blown the masts from their steps. But&#xD;
as it was, though she seemed for a moment&#xD;
to stagger and bury under its force, she&#xD;

THE MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
gathered headway and started ofIftlose-hauled&#xD;
on the wind.&#xD;
I Well met-I hope she'll keep it up as&#xD;
well !" muttered the experienced captain.&#xD;
" If sue can claw off under this gale she is a&#xD;
star boat !"&#xD;
"Could we not run into Mariel and lay&#xD;
there till it is over ?" asked Robinson.&#xD;
" Yes, and before we were there an hour&#xD;
a despatch would be oil to Havana to let old&#xD;
Coucha know that ' a strange, long low, black,&#xD;
rakish looking schooner' lay in Her Majes&#xD;
ty's harbor, and it the gale didn't blow us&#xD;
ashore, we'd have half a dozen steamers after&#xD;
us as soon as it was over. I'd rather risk&#xD;
fight. out here at sea !"&#xD;
" Weil, you know best--but I think the&#xD;
gale incT eases every moment."&#xD;
a You are right, it does, but if we can car-&#xD;
ry sail for four or five hours, we can gain an&#xD;
offing that will leave us safe at any rate.&#xD;
This gale rose as the sun went down, it will&#xD;
fall when it rises. 11 our spars will only&#xD;
hold, l care not, but it is going to blow great&#xD;
grins I"s&#xD;
The gale did in fact increase every me-&#xD;
ment, and the sea rose rapidly, so high that&#xD;
the schooner pitched bows under at every&#xD;
heave, and made but little headway. The&#xD;
face of Clewline soon wore an anxious look,&#xD;
and his eye wandered from the compass to&#xD;
the bending spars, forebodingly.&#xD;
W here was Charley Gardner all this time?&#xD;
Pacing the forward part of the deck thinking&#xD;
of the past---.of her who had followed him&#xD;
there, and whose warning voice still rung on&#xD;
his ear, which heard inot, heeded not the wild&#xD;
whistling gale, the fierce dashing sea.&#xD;
Robinson, who had heard her words at the&#xD;
time, asked him who it was, and what she&#xD;
meant, but Gardner only replied :&#xD;
"I will tell you another time. It is no-&#xD;
thing "&#xD;
Since then he had not uttered a word. As&#xD;
&#xD;
ni.tht passed o, each moment seemed more&#xD;
terrible, for with it the gale increased and the&#xD;
sea arose until the schooner no longer made&#xD;
headway and could scarcely he kept head to&#xD;
the wind and waves. ier spars bent and&#xD;
buckled--her hull creaked and groaned, and&#xD;
at last it seemed as it the close reefed fbre.&#xD;
sail would burst from its ropings ana leave&#xD;
the craft helpless on the water.&#xD;
Clewline said nothing--his voice could not&#xD;
have been heard in the tempest, but he stood&#xD;
stiff and immovable at the helm, bracing his&#xD;
stalwart frame against the stanchions of the&#xD;
wheel watchiag his course at the compass,&#xD;
for now it was pitchy dark upon the waters.&#xD;
" Would to God the wind would naul !"&#xD;
he muttered to, himself. " If it does'rrt we'll&#xD;
see land astern before we do ahead !"&#xD;
But scarcely had these words left his lips&#xD;
when a ciaek like the report of a cannon camne&#xD;
upon his ears, a: d the next moment, as thr.&#xD;
weather laniards parted, the foremast was&#xD;
seen to reel arid go :whirling over the side.&#xD;
The strain had been too great, the taunt&#xD;
spar had snapped close of' at the deck.&#xD;
Clewline and one or two of his crew sprane&#xD;
forward to clear away the wreck ere it dn-&#xD;
aged the hull, and in a few moments mitd,&#xD;
lone-but alas the vessel now drifted hip-&#xD;
lessly toward a rock-bound shore.  Rapid&#xD;
was she swept in towards the land upo e&#xD;
heaving sea, the gale still howling abovl he'.&#xD;
fast hurrying her on to destruction.&#xD;
The band who feared not death on the b:-&#xD;
tle field, and who world not have shrunk&#xD;
from any mortal encounter, were now grosm&#xD;
ed around the deck, clinging to the shattera&#xD;
rail in speechless terror. Clewline fne&#xD;
how faint was their chance of safety. lie&#xD;
could not let go an anchor, for the fathomless&#xD;
depths of the gulf stream lashed the very base&#xD;
of the cliffs before him.&#xD;
Suddenly the dash of breakers came roll-&#xD;
ing off upon their ears. Each eye endeavor-&#xD;
&#xD;
ed to pierce the gloom before them to see&#xD;
the fearful danger which awaite them. But&#xD;
least unconcerned of all stood barles Gard-&#xD;
ner. Her warning voice still -u.ig in his&#xD;
ear-.&#xD;
On, on drove the vessel--,the sound of the&#xD;
gale was now drowned in the dash of the&#xD;
breakers. Now they could see the. white&#xD;
mountains of foam before them. All held&#xD;
their breath, for each knew that death was&#xD;
before then. No hope for life-- no chance&#xD;
for escape. The crew made no eflbrt-they&#xD;
knew that it was useless. One moment of&#xD;
suspense-and an eternity in that moment,&#xD;
and then the ill fated bark was lifted high&#xD;
against the rugged cliT and dashed into&#xD;
atoms. One shrill wild cry, then all was&#xD;
hushed.&#xD;
There ore some men who cannot (lie ua1-&#xD;
they wish to. Charles Gardner was d hed&#xD;
by the high crested wave from    the b  v&#xD;
where he stood upon the very crest of the&#xD;
cliff  He alone of all that gallant band was&#xD;
saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
1V&#xD;
&#xD;
Once more was Charles Gardner safe.--&#xD;
Though the storm still raged-though the&#xD;
linked lightning ran from cloud to cloud-&#xD;
though the frown of the Almighty God seem-&#xD;
ed to rest above him, he was ,safe at least&#xD;
from the peril of the ocean&#xD;
Left alone upon that desolate rock, with&#xD;
the wild waters of the ocean dashing madly&#xD;
against its base, and the hoarse wind of&#xD;
IHeaven howling over its rugged peak, hat&#xD;
were his feelings? True, he had anma  of&#xD;
the country ; he had letters of introduction&#xD;
and instructions how to act in case he should&#xD;
fall into the company of condras Partisans,&#xD;
He had further instructions, which would&#xD;
guide him to the stronghold of the Patriots in&#xD;
the island. The last words of his ruined wife&#xD;
&#xD;
"you have murdered Orrin Bird, I will yet&#xD;
revenge him," still rung in his ears, an al-&#xD;
though the vessel which bore her had long&#xD;
since passed heyound the reach of is eye,&#xD;
still he fancied that he saw her white sails,&#xD;
picture like looming up from the dark waters,&#xD;
and the form of Fanny Gardner-still standing&#xD;
erect upon the bow, waving her thin hand in&#xD;
defiance.&#xD;
For several minutes Gardner stood watch-&#xD;
ing the fancied vessel, though the t ain was&#xD;
pouring down in torrents,when a sudden gu3t&#xD;
f overthrew a coaco tree under which he had&#xD;
taken shelter, and felled him to the ground,&#xD;
at the same time sheltering  him, with its&#xD;
broad leaves from the rain. The shock sud-&#xD;
den and violent, was not so severe as to se-&#xD;
riously injure him, and when the squall passed&#xD;
lhe eiimerged from his temtaporary and unsought&#xD;
heheltr. A smart breeze had blown up, and&#xD;
the clouds were moving to the eastward in&#xD;
huge banks. The stars began to show them.&#xD;
selves, and by their aid he was enabled to&#xD;
shape his course.&#xD;
But he was fifteen miles from the hacienda&#xD;
de Alvarez, and his path was literally one of&#xD;
thorns ; for on that structed heath no tree&#xD;
raised its loftiEst leaf over fifteen feet from the&#xD;
unfriendly sands, while the norned cactus,&#xD;
and hundreds of specimens of its kindred&#xD;
shrubs, covered the ground as thick asy thrif:&#xD;
ty rye upon a Naw Hampshire side hill farm&#xD;
-all around as  if for self-protection, with&#xD;
miniature lances. T through this chapparel&#xD;
Charles Gardner made his way, torn and&#xD;
bleeding, and at sunrise found himself up n&#xD;
the bowler of a small but deep stream the&#xD;
Rio Sabina. The hacienda de Alvarez was&#xD;
in sight, and he had no alternative lit to&#xD;
swim the stream. Accordingly he s cured&#xD;
his letters of introduction in his hat,and using&#xD;
a slab of Mahogany, as a means of transpor.&#xD;
tation for his uniform, easily reached the op.&#xD;
posite shore.&#xD;

THE MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
It was an hour before sunrise when Gard&#xD;
ner approached the comal of the hacienda de&#xD;
Alvarez, but he found peons already astir,&#xD;
and the Major Domo and his underling tal-&#xD;
leying themoff for the ir respective days werks.&#xD;
Accosting the Major Domo he learned thet&#xD;
signor Alvarez would b in his tidie io&#xD;
half an hour, and ho gluoly accepted and in&#xD;
vitation of tht fuoctionary to partake of' a&#xD;
eup of cothe, s on d with a wine glads of&#xD;
pure cati :n.&#xD;
Siguor Avarcz s nn made his appearance,&#xD;
and on r..ceiving and readiiig the letters pre-&#xD;
ented by Gardner weloms=d him to Cuba&#xD;
and his haeientda, and ordered a horse, that&#xD;
the disringuihed stranger might accompany&#xD;
him in his rile around the hacienda. But&#xD;
Gardnr weak and ahost exhausted from the&#xD;
fatigues of the pa t twenty-four hours, plea&#xD;
ded indisposition, ani was shown to an cit&#xD;
gant apartment of the mansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
!lorious inheritarc , Present or absent, the&#xD;
beautiful G uadaloup was ever in his thoughts;&#xD;
the subject of his dreams, the object of his ado.&#xD;
ration.&#xD;
i must here digress a moment to describe&#xD;
ti hacienda de Alvarez, which is one of the&#xD;
ioveliostplantations upon the Queen of the&#xD;
Antilles. Signor Alvarez was a partisan&#xD;
with Don Miguel in the ineffectual revolt&#xD;
agaiutt Don Pedro, in thu one thousand and&#xD;
sixty seventh (or thereabouts) revolution in&#xD;
Spain, and finding that resiatauce to the crown&#xD;
was useless, left Brcelona and the Queen's&#xD;
watchful lancers to secure a more quiet life&#xD;
in Cuba. Immensely wealthy, he had pur.&#xD;
chased the Hacienda do Cordova, and given&#xD;
it his own name, and until the last three years&#xD;
had devoted his time and means to its inprove-&#xD;
mont.  As the traveller approaches the&#xD;
bt. i nha on the Havaoa road, the eye is&#xD;
i' rat attracted by the lofty towers of the&#xD;
&#xD;
After several hours' sleep he arose much' chapel-a  necessary  appendege to every&#xD;
refreshed and was not a little surprised to find 4ponish hacienda. Arriving nearer, an&#xD;
&#xD;
every article of dress he culd desire in the&#xD;
wardrobe. Leisurely taking advantage of&#xD;
this good fortune Gardner descended to the&#xD;
drawing room  where he met the Quzenly&#xD;
Donna Alvarez and her daughter, Guada&#xD;
loupe, waiting breakfast for him. Coffee was&#xD;
served, and meats, but our adventurer par-&#xD;
took of but little of either; for the charming&#xD;
Guadaloupe, by her simple and unaffcted&#xD;
manner and artless conversation, engrossed&#xD;
his every thought, and he began to fedl, for&#xD;
the first time in his life, the real influences of&#xD;
love-that love which is heaven-born ; lov-&#xD;
that is taught rnot by Ovid--love that was&#xD;
never imagined by Anachreon; pure un-nix-&#xD;
ed, sincere love. The terrors of' the past&#xD;
night vanished from his thoughts ; the ana-&#xD;
themas of Fanny Gardner were forgotten ;&#xD;
his triumphs, his sorrows were ost in the dim&#xD;
shadow of bygone time, and h fancied that&#xD;
he had been awakened to a new being on a&#xD;
&#xD;
orange grove, covering some two thousand&#xD;
square acree, is encountered, and as you en-&#xD;
ter the principal gareta a long linege olive&#xD;
trees line the elaborately pebbled walk. The&#xD;
mnsaion need not be des Bribod for any one&#xD;
who han over visited that lovely island ; but&#xD;
to those uninitiated, a few words may be ex-&#xD;
cused. The main residence, with its church&#xD;
and stables, occupied sonic six acres of land,&#xD;
while the buildings for the peons (some three&#xD;
thousand men and woOen) were established&#xD;
in the rear of the fortifications. No hacienda&#xD;
in Cuba was better pre pared for defensive&#xD;
warfare than that of Alvarez, and no better&#xD;
patriot breathed than its master.&#xD;
Gardnczr soon discovered that he was in a&#xD;
tine field of clover for the field of operation,&#xD;
that best suited his purposes,and his passions&#xD;
soon overcame the feeling that first took pos-&#xD;
session of his heart on meeting Guadaloupe&#xD;
Alvarez. He was an intimate of the family,&#xD;
&#xD;
harbored as a friend of Cuban Liberty, en-&#xD;
trusted, if I may use the word, with its choicest&#xD;
jewel, and doubting the result of the patriot&#xD;
demonstration determined to make the best he&#xD;
could of the time thus luckily granted him.&#xD;
It was evening-one of those evenings&#xD;
which are only seen in Italy, in he high&#xD;
lands of Mexico and the Queen of the Antil-&#xD;
les-when Gardner, seizing the opportunity&#xD;
afforded by the temporary absence oh' the&#xD;
Donna Maria Alvarez, proposed to the gen&#xD;
tie Guadalouape a walk in the orange grove.&#xD;
We will hear their conversation for a mo-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
" I have never known happiness until this&#xD;
moment, darest Guadaloupe, never felt,until&#xD;
this hour, the real promptings of love."&#xD;
"Sir, you are ardent, we have not been&#xD;
acquainted but a day.&#xD;
"A day! There is no time, no space, no&#xD;
country for love such as mine-may I hope&#xD;
ouch as ours is, Guadaloupe. You do not&#xD;
know me. For years-from my boyhood I&#xD;
have been a stray waif upon the ocean of&#xD;
fate. 1. have traversed many countries and&#xD;
have seen what were called the loveliest&#xD;
women in the world ; but never has my heart&#xD;
been engaged until J met with you."&#xD;
"Sir, you flatter me. I am young, know&#xD;
little of the world ; I am aware that one&#xD;
older than myself may take advantage of my&#xD;
ignorance of conversational rules, but you&#xD;
are a friend of my father, a guest at our ha-&#xD;
cienda, and I cannot refuse you my confi-.&#xD;
deuce,"&#xD;
"Loveliest of creation! doubt not a woid&#xD;
that I utter, for never was man more sincere.&#xD;
I love you with all my heart and soul -ny&#xD;
existence is all centered in you. Say that,&#xD;
when this ovely country is free from Spanish&#xD;
rule, -- when I shall have proved mnys-If&#xD;
worthy of Cuba and you, that ' may hope.&#xD;
Nay I dwil hope.".&#xD;
&#xD;
A clattering of hoofs was heard on the&#xD;
street, and soon of er in the court y ard.&#xD;
"My father has returned,'said Guadaloupe,&#xD;
a but he must have met with many friends,&#xD;
for I discver.some twenty horsemen."&#xD;
fL rrner looked toward the main entrance&#xD;
to t:c cmina a sav two companies of Span.&#xD;
ish lancers, led by Morellia, coming up the&#xD;
avenue o tu lives.&#xD;
"-xdaop#. exclaimed he, in terror qI am&#xD;
lost.  These are the Queens' troops--they&#xD;
will make me prisoner, and you k:ow the&#xD;
ftte that is sur to follow the result.''&#xD;
''Oh this is terrible" exclaimed the infa-&#xD;
tuated girl--'they will kill you."&#xD;
"Be that as t may," responded Gardner,&#xD;
" I shall willingly meet death as I. krw that&#xD;
your tears will water the thistles .upon my&#xD;
grave."&#xD;
Tre sound of marching troops came each&#xD;
moment neater.&#xD;
Can I not save you ?" enquir'd the&#xD;
gentle Guadaloupe.&#xD;
" How ?"&#xD;
"I know a way."&#xD;
* 2       *     C      *&#xD;
&#xD;
At day break the battalion of lancers quitted&#xD;
the hacienda de Alvarez well satisfied with&#xD;
the fare they received, and also well satisfied&#xD;
that the "Piate" was not a habitant of that&#xD;
pc incelv plantation.&#xD;
As the lancers moved off, Guadaloupe&#xD;
crossed over to the chapel and ascended to&#xD;
one oft's towers to satisfy herself of their&#xD;
departure. Here she remained till nhc had&#xD;
seen the battalion pass down the Havana&#xD;
road, and disappear in the distance.&#xD;
'hen quitting the tower, she r turned to&#xD;
the house, glided so'lly through the long hall&#xD;

pere -ived, she ors-ed o-ye of the gav h-&#xD;
path; 1 adiug to the left corner of ti gdtf fl&#xD;
and  drawing aide a portion e    the ivy&#xD;
which cov 'red the wall, expo-ed a numbd"rt of&#xD;
j  snmalt holes bored at irr.ular distances in&#xD;
the lteer, and which, when undisturbed, the&#xD;
ivy i-ctually screened from view.&#xD;
The lovely girl, whose features were now&#xD;
crirm oned with blush e-. cughed three times.&#xD;
and fixed her eyes upon a portion of the wall&#xD;
before her, which a moment later opened&#xD;
from within, and a man stepped forth. It&#xD;
r was Charles Gardner.&#xD;
" My sweet love-~my preserver !" he ex-&#xD;
clainied, passionately pressing the beautiful&#xD;
maiden to his breast and imprinting a kiss&#xD;
upon her blushing cheek. " What do 1 not&#xD;
owe you for having saved me&#xD;
lush !" returned Guadaloupe, gently&#xD;
withdrawing from his embrace, " we may be&#xD;
overhear I, perhaps," she added, dropping her&#xD;
eyes which were swimming with tears-&#xD;
" perhaps perceived !"  I&#xD;
"fBut you are weeping, my beloved one-"&#xD;
" Must we not part?" returned the maiden,&#xD;
naive ly, while her beautiful form trembled&#xD;
with love's tumultuous fire.&#xD;
" Part !" said Gardner, starting. " Why,&#xD;
Guadaloupe, why should we part, now that&#xD;
all danger is over?"&#xD;
The maiden shook her head. " It is not&#xD;
all over," she said, tearfully.&#xD;
"What ! Are the troops still here ?"&#xD;
"No. They are gone ; but they will soon&#xD;
return to renew their search. You must&#xD;
fly1!"&#xD;
And whither?" asked Gardner, sensitive.&#xD;
ly alive to his peril.&#xD;
"To the sea shore, to the n  utains-any&#xD;
where !" returned  Guadaloupe, trembling&#xD;
with agitation. " But here -here you must&#xD;
not remain.   The slaves are keen: crafty&#xD;
and treacherous, and their argus eyes would&#xD;
{ be sure to deter Nou!"&#xD;
&#xD;
i But," cried Grd ner, impetuously, "they&#xD;
surely would not betray a guest of their mas-&#xD;
iter's !"&#xD;
" You do not know them," replied the&#xD;
young girl, with an air of deep anguish.-&#xD;
"Their very natures are grasping and per..&#xD;
fidious. For money they would sell their&#xD;
very master ?"&#xD;
"But who," said Gardner, with a smile,&#xD;
is to offer them money for my betrayal ?"&#xD;
"The Captain General," returned Guada.&#xD;
lope, quickly. "The instant the lancers re-&#xD;
turn with the report that1they have not been&#xD;
able to find you,Concha will issue proclama-&#xD;
tion offering a large reward for your capture,&#xD;
and have it posted on every hill, fhnce and&#xD;
tree for miles around our hacienda. Yes," she&#xD;
added, in a voice which appeared to shako her&#xD;
very soul, "there is no hope -you must fly !"&#xD;
" My daughter speaks aright," interrupted&#xD;
a stern voice near them. "Senor Garduer&#xD;
must fly, and instantly."&#xD;
It was Alvarez who, having seen the pair&#xD;
from the window of his chamber, had do.&#xD;
seceded and quietly approached them.&#xD;
Guadaloupe blushed still deeperas her glance&#xD;
met that of her father, upon whose brow hung&#xD;
a portentous frown.&#xD;
There is danger then, in my remainingg'&#xD;
said Grdner, slightly coloring as he caught&#xD;
the eye of his host.&#xD;
"My daughter has already explained it to&#xD;
you !" returned Alvarez, coldly. Then turn.&#xD;
ing to the trembling Guadaloupe, ho added :&#xD;
Hence, girl, to your chamber. I will at-&#xD;
tend to the wants of Senor Gardner, myself.&#xD;
Begoe !"&#xD;
The lovely girl flung a despairing look up&#xD;
at her lover, and then, with towering steps,&#xD;
retreated from the guard en.&#xD;
SSenoir, continued Alvcarez, sternly, a&#xD;
Cu daloupo disopeared, ' your conduct in&#xD;
attempting to plp  t ih the alheions of my&#xD;
child, merits my severest coned nation."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Sir !" returned Gardner, drawing him-&#xD;
self up.&#xD;
"Enough!'' returned the Spaiiard, con-&#xD;
temptuously. "Your airs are thrown away&#xD;
upon roe. I am an old man, sir, and have&#xD;
seen too much of the world to be imposed&#xD;
uponby so miserable an adventurer as your-&#xD;
self !"&#xD;
Beware, sir !" c' ied Gardner, bristling&#xD;
up. ' Such insolence shall not-"&#xD;
 He paused abruptly, for the eye of the&#xD;
indignant Spaniard was fixed upon him with&#xD;
a cold, stony. disdainful glance:&#xD;
" Go on, Senor !" said Alvarez, with forced&#xD;
calmness. "You were about to charge me&#xD;
with insolence, and to threaten me, eke, if l&#xD;
mistake not. Pray, go on !"&#xD;
And the tones of his voice indicated the&#xD;
storm which was working in his breast.&#xD;
Gardner was silent. He trembled be fire&#xD;
the stern man before him.&#xD;
"You have thought better of it !" observ-&#xD;
ed the Spaniard, at length, in a sarcastic&#xD;
voice. " You will not threaten ?  You wil&#xD;
not even trust yourself to speak, would-be&#xD;
seducer of my child ! Enough," lhe added,&#xD;
with an effort, "I will not force you to it !&#xD;
Follow me, and make ready for your deper.&#xD;
ture !"&#xD;
So saying, he turned from the garden to&#xD;
the house, followed by his gust, whose cece;&#xD;
was pale with the sickly hue of detected&#xD;
guilt.&#xD;
The Spaniard led the way to his own&#xD;
chamber, and pointing to a heap of rough&#xD;
clothing, observed-&#xD;
" There is a peasant's sailt. Put it on.&#xD;
Dioguised iu that, you can traverse the cot:-&#xD;
try without fear of deteetion."&#xD;
So Eaying he left the room, and when ii,&#xD;
returned, he held iO ono hand a moderately&#xD;
filled purse, and in the oter I kiife.&#xD;
&#xD;
buy you food, the other will enable you to&#xD;
defend yourself' in case of attack. Now fol-&#xD;
low me!"&#xD;
lie led the way from the hacienda to the&#xD;
road on the left.&#xD;
"Now, Senor," he said, sternly, " we are&#xD;
strangers again.  Go your way. While a&#xD;
guest under my roof, I could not treat you&#xD;
otherwise than as a friend. You have your-&#xD;
self to thank that I am henceforth your ene-&#xD;
my. Already a married man-i learned it&#xD;
by one of your letters-you yet (ared to&#xD;
make overtures of love to my daughter ! Go,&#xD;
wretch ! If from this hour you are seen in&#xD;
this neighborhood, you shall be shot down&#xD;
like a dog ! Go !"&#xD;
Gardner slunk away like a detected thief,&#xD;
and striking across the country, started in the&#xD;
direction of Puerto Principe.&#xD;
"Curse mys ill stors !" he muttered. "Had&#xD;
They not brought the old fool upon me so&#xD;
so on I would, in another minute have per.&#xD;
suad-ed the lovely Gaudaloupe to share my&#xD;
IIght ! She is a tempting little piece, and&#xD;
would console a fellow for theless of twenty&#xD;
such creatures as Fanny !"&#xD;
A shudder passed over him as he uttered&#xD;
this name.&#xD;
"She has the heart of a tigress," he con.&#xD;
tinted, " and will not rest till she sees me in&#xD;
he dust ! She has sworn it, and she is un-&#xD;
fortnately one of those who keep their&#xD;

"1 have already publicly announced the&#xD;
'Manner of the 'pirates' death, madam," said.&#xD;
the Captain General, shuddering in spite of&#xD;
himself at the relentless spirit before him,&#xD;
"and that will render your wish impossible!"&#xD;
" Wherefore, senor ?"&#xD;
"They are to be shot, madam--publicly,&#xD;
at the brow of the castle of Atares. You&#xD;
perceive, therefore, the unreasonableness of&#xD;
your proposition. I have no objection to&#xD;
your witnessing the execution, but it must b e&#xD;
at a distance. IThere would be danger, great&#xD;
danger, to your person, in looking at it from&#xD;
so near a point as would enable you to hear&#xD;
the man's dying cries. You must think of&#xD;
something else, madam !"&#xD;
"If my proposal to deliver these adventur-&#xD;
ers into your hands, senor, so that you can&#xD;
crush them and their designs at a blow, be&#xD;
of any value in your eyes -"&#xD;
" I do not deny its importance, madam.--&#xD;
On the contrary I regard it as 6f inestimable&#xD;
value."&#xD;
"Then, senor," said the lovely but impla-&#xD;
cable woman," you can easily find a way to&#xD;
pay the price I. set upon it."&#xD;
"Suggest something, madam, and I will&#xD;
make no effort to fly from it. Your brain, it&#xD;
one might judge by the clearness of your eye,&#xD;
just be fertile in expedients. Come, propose&#xD;
one, and we'll see if it cantot he managed !"&#xD;

low, dimly lighted dungeon, where no eye&#xD;
but that of the executioner and mine might&#xD;
look upon his writhings, where no ear but the&#xD;
executioner's and mine could hearken to his&#xD;
dying wail ?"&#xD;
Yes, madam," said the Captain General,&#xD;
surveying her with an expression of ill-con-&#xD;
cealed disgust," that can be done."&#xD;
Will it be ?" persisted Fanny Gardner,&#xD;
bendir  her dark eyes upon him with a piti-&#xD;

It is "&#xD;
" And will not be violated-not even so&#xD;

visitor, with an expression of triumph.&#xD;
"No!" returned the Captain General, shud-&#xD;
dering at her implacable spirit. "Now, wo-&#xD;
man, your plan--quick. My time is pre-&#xD;

ed the Captain. Gneral, with an air of sur&#xD;
prise.&#xD;
" On my way to Havana, I beheld him&#xD;
with fitty others, on board a schooner which&#xD;
was working its way to Havana."&#xD;
" Tht is possible, madam. But I receiv.&#xD;
ed yesterday information-from my spies that&#xD;
that schooner was destroyed upon our coast,&#xD;
and that but one of all on board escaped.-&#xD;
That one has been tracked to a certain plan.&#xD;

of harboring thoughts and intentions traitor,&#xD;

i astonishn  t. " You are sure of' ti s ?'&#xD;
"Quite sure, madam. I had it from my&#xD;
spies, ho know that to bring me 'false intel&#xD;
ligence is equivalent to signing their own&#xD;
death warrant-&#xD;
u You are well served, senor !" returned&#xD;
the lady with a smile.&#xD;
" To the point, madam!" said Concha,&#xD;
impatiently.&#xD;
" This one who has escaped, senor-if it&#xD;
be the man my heating breast assures roe that&#xD;
it is, you have need to call up all your ener.&#xD;
gies, all your cunning, or he will yet escape&#xD;
you !"J&#xD;
TJhe Captain General's only reply was an&#xD;
impatient shrug.&#xD;
"You have no fears-"&#xD;
" On that point, madam ?  No ! One' on&#xD;
the Island, he is mine ! There is not open&#xD;
to him a single avenue by which to eludo oe ;&#xD;
and once taken, there's an end of him. But&#xD;
how dors this afTct, the plan you have to&#xD;
propose ."&#xD;
"sNot a jot, senor,"  answered  Fanny&#xD;
Gardner, calmly - " for if it be .he who has&#xD;
escaped the dangers of the sea, he will, 1&#xD;
am confident, also avoid capture till the great&#xD;
body of the liberators arrive !'&#xD;
And how long will that be, madam ?"&#xD;
demanded Concha, with an air of renewed&#xD;
interest.&#xD;
"A few days, at farthest. Lopez and his&#xD;
party were to kave New    Orleans on the&#xD;
twentieth."&#xD;
"What do you deduce from that, madam ?"&#xD;
" Tlis. On the arrival of Lopez, he will&#xD;
join him, and then all danger to him is at an&#xD;
end."&#xD;

an air of mockery. "Is it on then alone&#xD;
that you rely ?''&#xD;
No !" said the Captain General.  " In&#xD;
ease of necessity-rather than these pirates&#xD;
should triumph, I would free and let loose&#xD;
upon them the great horde of slaves which&#xD;
constitute the largest part of our population.&#xD;
I would cut them off from all hope of pro-&#xD;

" But what if they should land at a point&#xD;
where the people are ready and eager to join&#xD;

"Such a step," returned tIle Captain Gen.&#xD;
eral, " would, I must frankly admit, give me 'p&#xD;
some uneasiness. But why do you ask that&#xD;
question ?"&#xD;
" Because such is the intention of Lopez."&#xD;

" I heard it at New Orleans."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
.Let us now take a flying trip to New Or&#xD;
leans, and learn what is going:on among those&#xD;
whom Fanny G rdner had doomed to des&#xD;
traction,&#xD;
At on oblong tabl3ecovered with gree&#xD;
baize and over which maps, "exchanges&#xD;
and writing impkments are carele sly srea&#xD;
tored, in the sanctum of the chief editor o&#xD;
the Ne  Orleans Delta, three persons ar&#xD;
seated, and discussing the contents of siom&#xD;
private letters I1 ing open before them. Ii&#xD;
one of these, we find the editor of the Delta&#xD;
in the second the captain of the stearne&#xD;
Pampere, and in the third Lopez tha leader&#xD;
of the Liberating expedition.&#xD;
The editor is addressing his compaiions -&#xD;
Let us throw on an invisible mantle, an&#xD;
isten,&#xD;
"There is no good reason, in my opinion&#xD;
why the steamer should not start to-morrow&#xD;
The men are all in readiness, the arms, am&#xD;
munuiton, arid other essentials aboard, and-&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, Mr. Sigur, interrup&#xD;
ted Lopez, with an air of impatience. "Bu&#xD;
I hav already told you that tIto arms are&#xD;
not of a satisfactory character. An enter.&#xD;
prise liko ours, should be provided with the&#xD;
best weapons to be had ithe market. Those&#xD;
in our hands are, on the contrary, of a very&#xD;
inferior quality.  I, for one, will not consent&#xD;
to joopardise the lives of my men with such&#xD;
miserable afiirs."&#xD;
"But, general," remonetrated the editor,&#xD;
"it will not do to lose another day. The&#xD;
rifles which are coming from the North will&#xD;
tint be here for fourteen days; and if we wait&#xD;
till that time who can tell the injury it mey&#xD;
do to the gallant creoles of Principe, who,&#xD;
relying upon our hourly arrival, are now&#xD;
ghting so bravely against the imnenn odd&#xD;
hurled against them by the Captain (' ne ral ?&#xD;
Fourteen days, sir- what might not he ppen in&#xD;
&#xD;
that time? 'The creeos, disheartened by our&#xD;
non-appearance, may resign themselves to&#xD;
r. despair, throw down their hopes and their&#xD;
e arms, and yield themselves to the Spaniards !"'&#xD;
- " There is more truth than poetry in that,&#xD;
Mr. Sigur!" observed Captain Lewis, "and&#xD;
n I think general," he added, turning to Lopez&#xD;
" "that we might as well give up all idea of the&#xD;
t expedition, if we have to wait till the arrival&#xD;
f of the arms promised by our friends at the&#xD;
e North. The fourteen days thus lost could&#xD;
e not be returned, and at this juncture, time,&#xD;
a with our creole brethren at Principe, time is&#xD;
every thing. It is my opinion that we should&#xD;
r start without delay !"&#xD;
r   "Your idea, captain Lewis, is correct,"&#xD;
said the editor, with a smile of approbation:&#xD;
- And I think, general," he continued, ad.&#xD;
d dressing Lopez, "you will agree with us&#xD;
upon more mature efetion that the arms&#xD;
,,we have arc at least as good, if not better,&#xD;
. than those employed by the Spaniards."&#xD;
"I do not deny that, Mr. Sigur," returned&#xD;
- Lopez. "But I repeat it,.they should not be&#xD;
on a par only with those of the Spanish troops&#xD;
t -they should be superior."v&#xD;
" What the weapons lack in superiority&#xD;
will be amply compensated by the superior&#xD;
courage and intelligenceofour imen !" observed&#xD;
Captain Lewis.&#xD;
"I admit-the force of your remark sir,'&#xD;
said Lopez, " but I remember at the same&#xD;
time the immense legions which will be op&#xD;
posed to our comparatively trifling band. To&#xD;
meet them with any prospect of triumph we&#xD;
should make up in the character of our arms&#xD;
what we los, in numbers '&#xD;
"lut,"said thi editor, "weshall not bo alone&#xD;
in our combat with Concha's hoat. The&#xD;
creoles will he with us, and their force is res-&#xD;
pectable. United, we will oppose to the&#xD;
Spanish liuen a force which will smite them&#xD;

" I was ahut to observe, goentlemen,r' ter&#xD;

I now wash my hands of nit"&#xD;
" But you will costiit to our proceeding&#xD;
to-mforrow ?' demanded the editor.  -&#xD;
"I have already .given it," returned the&#xD;
general quietly. " I will proceed on board&#xD;
at once, and make my preparationts. At what&#xD;
hour shall we get up steam?"&#xD;
" At eleven."&#xD;
Very well," said the General risin-.-&#xD;
" You will see everything pared ! The&#xD;
custom house clearance obtained, and all oth&#xD;
er necessary papers to enable the steamer to&#xD;
quit the port without interruption ?"&#xD;
" Every thing shall be arranged, General,&#xD;
to your utmost satisfaction," replied the editor.&#xD;
" Captin Lewis and I understand .how to fix&#xD;
these matters. We have friends in the custom&#xD;
house, on whom we can rely."&#xD;
"Then I have nothing more to say," obs-erv&#xD;
ed Lopez, quietly. "Adieu i"&#xD;
And he quitted the apartment.&#xD;
True to his promise, the editor got every&#xD;
thing in readiness for the steamer's uninter.&#xD;
rupted departure, and at the appointed hour&#xD;
the Pumpero, her decks lined; with five hun-&#xD;
t dred brave and gallant hearted men, glided&#xD;
out into the stteam, and struck for Key West&#xD;
to take in stores.&#xD;
On reaching Key West, a letter was put&#xD;

the shadow of a line of low houses, to screen&#xD;
himself from observation. As he neared the&#xD;

80           THE MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
Fired with enthusiasm at their victory over&#xD;
a force four times that of their own, the ad.. o&#xD;
venturers called upn Lopez to lead them on f&#xD;
at once to the seat of insurrection. The lat-&#xD;
ter promised to do so at the end of three days, o&#xD;
trusting that in the meantime the report of ,s h&#xD;
triumph over the Spayuiards would induce the e&#xD;
people in the adjoining neighborhood to come&#xD;
in and swell his raik, which had suffered U&#xD;
severely in the battle.&#xD;
On the evening of the second day, a mes. s&#xD;
senger from Colonel Crinenden made his ap.&#xD;
pearance at Las Posas, and presented Lopezi&#xD;
with a note couched in the following words : r&#xD;
" I have h :ard of your battle and triumph,&#xD;
and regret that I was not with you to share&#xD;
in th mn. My mer~ complain bitterly of the&#xD;
ignoble position i1~ hich they are placed.--&#xD;
They say they d' not come to Cuba to watch&#xD;
a deserted town, but to perform their part in&#xD;
the glorious task of' giing freedom to the-&#xD;
whole Island.  It is their wish and nine that&#xD;
we may be permitted to join you.&#xD;
Yours, faithfully,t&#xD;
Wit. CItTTENDEN."   t&#xD;
On reading the note, Lopez took    out&#xD;
his pencil, and wrote underneath the signa-&#xD;
ture:&#xD;
"You have my permission to gratify the&#xD;
desire of your command. Join me at once.i&#xD;
Loriaz."   t&#xD;
On the receipt of this reply, Colonel Crit-&#xD;
tenden at once took up his march for Las&#xD;
Posas.  On striking out of Morillo, he found&#xD;
the highroadguarded on the left by a thickI&#xD;
wood, and on the right by a high, dense chap.&#xD;
Faral, which stretched ofn; apparently, for1&#xD;
miles, and terminated at the sea shore.&#xD;
He advanced about two miles, and when&#xD;
within some forty rods of the first bend in th&#xD;
road, was suddenly startled by the sight ot&#xD;
about five hundred Spanish troops, their bayo-&#xD;
nets glistening in the clear moonlight like&#xD;
blades of silver.&#xD;
&#xD;
He halted, a d, regardless of the immense&#xD;
dds against him, instantly drew U) his men.&#xD;
or battle.&#xD;
T he Spaniards, strong with a consciousness&#xD;
f their superior numbers, approached, con-&#xD;
ident of triumph, and when within about-&#xD;
ighty yards of the small but heroic band,&#xD;
tretched their lines across the road, and&#xD;
;alled upon the Liberators to surrender.&#xD;
Thirty muskets, each charged with a mes.&#xD;
enger of death, flashed forth in reply, and&#xD;
he front ranks of the Spanards were thrown&#xD;
nto confusion by the falling of their com-&#xD;
ades.&#xD;
Another volley of a similar number of&#xD;
pieces startled the troops out of all notion of&#xD;
a bloodless victory : for of the sixty shots&#xD;
hmiled against them, each had either killed&#xD;
or wounded its man, and the road was already&#xD;
strewed with the dying and the lead, and the&#xD;
rir.ringin with the shrieks and cries of the&#xD;
wounded.&#xD;
Dropping on their knees while they loaded,&#xD;
that the balls of the enemy might fly over&#xD;
them, the heroic band were in a few moments&#xD;
again prepared to thin the lines of the enemy;&#xD;
and rising, and each taking a caIn, deliber.&#xD;
ate aim, they again discharged their pieces,&#xD;
and then, taking advantage of the confusion&#xD;
into which their destructive fire had thrown&#xD;
the enemy,they formed into a serried line, and&#xD;
bringing down their bayonets, darted forward&#xD;
with a loud shout.&#xD;
The cnemy did not wait for the charge ;&#xD;
but broke and turning on their heel, fled, yel-&#xD;
ling with terror, back the route by which&#xD;
they had come.&#xD;
Crittenden, not deeming it politic to follow&#xD;
them too far, called off his men from the pur-&#xD;
suit ; and collecting the baggage which had'&#xD;
been confided to his charge by Lopez, cairn.&#xD;
ly resumed his march for Ls Posas-&#xD;
Lie had not proceeded more than a mile&#xD;
when he again perceived the enemy moving&#xD;
&#xD;
down upon him, and this time with an impe-&#xD;
tuosity which it was plainly evident his stpall&#xD;
party would find it folly to resist.&#xD;
Determined, however, not to yield without&#xD;
a struggle, the gallantsColonel formed his&#xD;
men into a line across the road, and intrepidly&#xD;
awaited the enemy, who were approaching at&#xD;
fullspeed.&#xD;
In a few moments their columns were with-&#xD;
in reaching distance, and both parties opened&#xD;
simultaneously a fierce, destructive fire,&#xD;
Eight of the small,, brave band fell, and&#xD;
the Spaniards, uttering loud cries, rushed for&#xD;
ward with leveled bayonets to charge the re-&#xD;
mainders&#xD;
Perceiving that it would be utterly useless&#xD;
to attempt to withstand the advancing host.&#xD;
-Crittend en gave the order for retreat, atnd the&#xD;
small party wheeled to the right and plunged&#xD;
into the chapparal, whither the enemy did&#xD;
not attempt to follow them.&#xD;
Once in the dense chapparal, the brave&#xD;
Colonel and his no less intrepid band wander-&#xD;
ed onward for an hour or more, when, deem.&#xD;
ing themselves safe from pursuit, they drop.&#xD;
ped down, weary and exhausted, to recruit&#xD;
their energies for the morrow in a brief sea.&#xD;
son of repose.&#xD;
The sun was high in the heavens when they&#xD;
awoke. As from the character of the chap.&#xD;
paral, they could hope neither for food nor&#xD;
water, Crittenden perceived the necessity of&#xD;
leaving it at once. But to do this was a feat&#xD;
easier to conceive than to execute.  The&#xD;
Chapparal was thick, tall, and it was import.&#xD;
sible to guess which way to steer. Should&#xD;
he strike to the north, he might wander on for&#xD;
miles, and instead of reaching a road might&#xD;
in the end find himself penetrating deeper&#xD;
and deeper into the unbroken mass. Should&#xD;
he march to the east, it might lead him to the&#xD;
very road from which he had fled, which&#xD;
was no doubt guarded at every step by the&#xD;
enemy, calmly awaiting his return. Shoulit&#xD;
&#xD;
he penetrate southward, it might eventuate&#xD;
in carrying him still further into the heart of&#xD;
the chapparal. Should he bend his steps&#xD;
westward, he might bring up at the sea shore.&#xD;
Turn where he would, bring up where he&#xD;
might, the chapparal was doubtless surround.&#xD;
ed on all sides by troops ready to pick oft his&#xD;
men the instant they should appear in sight.&#xD;
Nevertheless, to remain in the dense mass&#xD;
was certain to'entail death on himself and&#xD;
band iry the most rightful of all its forms-&#xD;
starvation and thirst! With these reflections&#xD;
his resolution was instantly take.&#xD;
"It is better," he said to his officers, "to&#xD;
incur the risk of being shot by the troops&#xD;
who are watching for us, than to meet a lin.&#xD;
gering fate here. Let us strike in a straight&#xD;
line from where we stand !"&#xD;
Orders were given to this effect, and thy&#xD;
band moved slowly in single file to the south.&#xD;
But after wandering for some hours, they felt&#xD;
satisfied that they were only penetrating fur.&#xD;
other and deeper into the thorny mass; and&#xD;
they halted to recruit their strength, which&#xD;
had been severely drawn upon in their tramp,&#xD;
through the stern stalks.&#xD;
After a brief rest, they struck eastward,&#xD;
and wandered on till nightfall, with the same&#xD;
result as before, when the darkness setting in,&#xD;
they were compelled to desist, and to seek in&#xD;
slumber a forgetfulness of their hunger anid&#xD;
thirst.&#xD;
Early   .the following morning they r&#xD;
sumed their i amp, and about noon came, to&#xD;
their great j y, to the road from which they&#xD;
had retreated. As they approached it, the&#xD;
foremost of the party   peered cautiously&#xD;
through the high, thorny stalks out upon the&#xD;
highway, but instantly drew back his head&#xD;
with a low moan. The whistling, a moment&#xD;
later, of a shower of bullets through, the&#xD;
stalks, followed by a roar of musketry and&#xD;
the frenzied yells of a thousand Spaniards,&#xD;
warned the band of the fate of their corn.&#xD;

back into the body of the chapptaral.&#xD;
Critenden, having satisfied himself that&#xD;
the poor fellow who had been shot was pastl&#xD;
human aid, and that the road was lined by&#xD;
blood thirsty troops eager to riddle him in&#xD;
pieces, resolved to try the remasining route in&#xD;
hope of reaching the sea shore.s&#xD;
With this design, he again took up hisc&#xD;
march, and wandered northward. Thle day&#xD;
wore on, and as night approached th.y were&#xD;
still groping their way through the thorny&#xD;
stalks. At length to their astonishment and&#xD;
delight the chapparal grew less and less dense.&#xD;
As they advanced, the stalks gradually d wie&#xD;
died smaller and sparser. By and bye, they&#xD;
could hear the faint moaning of the sea.&#xD;
fe'w minutes more, and they could feel the&#xD;
bracing breeze from the gulf sweeping around&#xD;
hem.&#xD;
It was midnight, as, groping on their hands&#xD;
and kneesthey emerged from the chapparal.&#xD;
Looking around they perceived that they&#xD;
had reached the beach, which was covered&#xD;
here and there with large ledges of rock.&#xD;
Mounting on one of the highest of these,&#xD;
Crittenden beheld, about a quarter of a mile&#xD;
to the east, a long pier, and behind it a series&#xD;
of streets, rising one above another in the form&#xD;
of an amphitheatre. He recognised the town&#xD;
in an instant ; and descending from the rock,&#xD;
he observed to his companions:&#xD;
" Comrades, let us not despair. We are&#xD;
but a few minutes' walk from Morillo, where,&#xD;
even though we may not find food to assuage&#xD;
the anguish of our hunger, we may yet ob-&#xD;
tai water to cool our parched lips, and re-&#xD;
vive our fainting forms. Let us proceed,&#xD;
cautiously. If the Spaniards are not there&#xD;
to confront us, happiness may yet be ours.-&#xD;
Courage, comrades--courage !"&#xD;
So saying, he placed himself at their&#xD;
head, and the weak fevered band, tottered af&#xD;
ter him in silence, as he led the way along the&#xD;
&#xD;
rocky shore to the edge of the town. The&#xD;
colonel bent his ear to the earth and listened.&#xD;
The sane unbroken silence, the same air&#xD;
of desertion which had marked it on the first&#xD;
approach of the Liberators, reigned in Morillo&#xD;
still.&#xD;
Having assured himself that the place was&#xD;
void of inhabitants, Crittenden signed to his&#xD;
companions to fellow, and then led the way&#xD;
to a well, situated on the main avenue near&#xD;
the heights, which they reached without ob.&#xD;
ervation and without interruption.&#xD;
The party was divirfed into lines of six&#xD;
men cich, and each line approactmd the well in&#xD;
succession, and drank. Never before dick&#xD;
Yater o 'orpo to ttee ien such a blessing I&#xD;
It was to them like the manna sent from&#xD;
leaven to the Israelites in the wilderness !&#xD;
But one thing was wanting to complete&#xD;
their happiness, and repay them for all their&#xD;
sufferings-a mouthful of food to allay the&#xD;
clamors of hunger. For two days and two&#xD;
nights nothing had passed their tips save the&#xD;
water they had just imbibe d !&#xD;
Food, however, they well knew, was not&#xD;
to be obtained in Moiillo. The inhabitants,&#xD;
on quitting it, had not left a crumb of any&#xD;
kind large enough to cover the point of a&#xD;
neeidt e.                         .&#xD;
The band grew desperate. Their thirst&#xD;
was allayed, but not the ir hunger, and their&#xD;
murmurs beesme loud and fierce. Turning&#xD;
to Colonel Crittenden, they exclaimed-&#xD;
"Show us food, or lead us where we can&#xD;
obtain it. We are starving !"&#xD;
' Comrades," returned the colonel, " had I&#xD;
the means of showing you food, -would I not&#xD;
lead you to it without your asking? you say&#xD;
you are starving. Ami not hungered also?"&#xD;
" Lead us then where we can obtain it&#xD;
ourselves !"&#xD;
" Comrades, whither shall I lead you ?"&#xD;
"Any where-we care not ! Here we can.&#xD;
not stay !"&#xD;
&#xD;
CL&#xD;
&#xD;
OF NEW ORLEANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
I repeat it, comrades: Whither shall F&#xD;
lead you ? to, Las Posas ? The road is lined&#xD;
with Concha's troops, watching with leveled&#xD;
musI ets for our appearance. There are ht&#xD;
fifty one of us, and we are without arms&#xD;
'Comrades, whither shall I lead you ?"'&#xD;
" Show us then the route back to our own&#xD;
country, since the ungrateful roles, instead&#xD;
of corning to our rescue, abandon us to defeat&#xD;
and death. Lead us back to our own land !"'&#xD;
" But comrades, what means haywd for&#xD;
transportation thither ? Even could we find a&#xD;
vessel, we should starve ere we reached&#xD;
borne !"&#xD;
" We'll run the risk of that! Rather than&#xD;
starve, .elieat our shoes, and after that cast&#xD;
lots. Some must die, that the rest may live&#xD;
Come, lead us home!''&#xD;
But, how can I lead you home, without&#xD;
means "&#xD;
"Comrades !" should a pri:e a }roach.&#xD;
ing them, " we are saved. There re four&#xD;
boats down by the pier !"&#xD;
" Do you hear that, colonel ?" cried the&#xD;
party, exultantly. " Will you refuse to lead&#xD;
us now&#xD;
"No," returned Ciittenden. "Since you&#xD;
wish it, we will strike for home. Follow te."&#xD;
And he led the way to the shore. The&#xD;
private had spoken truly. Therre were four&#xD;
boats lashed to the pier.&#xD;
The party   was instantly divided  into&#xD;
tweÂ°lves ,andeache haded byan ofieor,they en-&#xD;
tered the beats and pulled out into the gull.&#xD;
Their strength however,w:as fas leaving them,&#xD;
and their frenzied hope of running down to&#xD;
Key  Vest abandoned them ere they had been&#xD;
two hours on the sea.&#xD;
Noon approached; the tide was bearing in&#xD;
towards the shore, and the rowers were too&#xD;
weak to resist it. The boats drifted with the&#xD;
waves, and as the sun climbed its way slowl1&#xD;
&#xD;
here was by;this time scarcely suffielent&#xD;
sense among the wretched party to render&#xD;
them ali'e to the horrors of their situation.-&#xD;
)f the fitr boats C ittendetn's was the only&#xD;
one whieh could boast of four rowers. The&#xD;
other, averaged but two each. The great&#xD;
majority of the crews had succumbed to hun-&#xD;
ger. SAome lay senseless at the bottom of the&#xD;
frail barks. Others reclined upon the sides,&#xD;
one gnawing his shoes ; another slowly chew.&#xD;
ing up the fragments of his neckerchief; a&#xD;
third, nursing his tobacco quid to bunt the&#xD;
edge of his hunger  a fourth, gnawing his&#xD;
fingers, and :tucking the blood, thus fiintly&#xD;
assuaging at the same time both his pinching&#xD;
hunger and his parching thirst. The scene&#xD;
was horrible ; and Crittendet, himself weak,&#xD;
pale, nerveless and f verish, placed his hands&#xD;
before his ey es to shut out the fthight ful sight.&#xD;
fie was aroused by the report of a gun.-&#xD;
Looking off in the direction of the eund, he&#xD;
beheili a war steamer rapidly approaching&#xD;
him, with the Spanish flag waving at the&#xD;
mast head 1&#xD;
" We ore lost !" he murmured. " Even&#xD;
if we had weapons, we have not strength&#xD;
enough to use them !'&#xD;
lis observation was correct. There was&#xD;
sea0rct ly a man on board the boat capable of&#xD;
holding uphis head. The faces of the hap-&#xD;
less party were pale, pinched and lengthened&#xD;
with suffering and misery. Their eyes were&#xD;
wild, staring and glassy ; and it required&#xD;
but half a glance to pet ceive that the poor&#xD;
fellows were on the verge of ndioss.&#xD;
Aht !~' murmured the colonel, looking at&#xD;
them with a shud der, " what hunger and thirst&#xD;
will do! My heart bleeds for you, rug brave&#xD;
comrades--my heart bleeds for you!p"&#xD;
To his own su ilrinrs the gallant officer&#xD;
gave not a thought. Every faculty was wrapt&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
e   Let us now return to Lopez; whom we left&#xD;
. at Las Posas, and who was wholly ignorant of&#xD;
the fate of the gallant but unfortunate Colonel,&#xD;
A fier waiting three days ft r the arrival of&#xD;
Colonel Crit enden, whose non appearance at&#xD;
Las Posas was a source of considerable in.&#xD;
quietude to him, the General despatched a&#xD;
messenger to Morillo to learn the cause of&#xD;
his delay.&#xD;
The messenger had not proceeded many&#xD;
miles on his route, when he discovered some&#xD;
ten or twelve hundred troops and a large&#xD;
number of armed Cubans watching the chap.&#xD;
paral.  The  g nral appearance of the road&#xD;
satisfied him that a battle had been fought be.&#xD;
twetn Critenden and the Spaniards, who had&#xD;
in the end driven the gallant Colonel to look&#xD;
for safety in the chapparal.&#xD;
leaving made these observations, the mes-&#xD;
senger returned to Las Posas, and gave in&#xD;
his report to Lopez, who reflected a few mo-&#xD;
nts, and then resolved to proceed at once&#xD;
to the Colonel's rescue. 11 is columrns were&#xD;
s u in riotion, ,iand an honr's march brought&#xD;
tn in sigit of the enemy, on whom he fell&#xD;
with such impetuosity that the latter, notwith-&#xD;
standing their aups-rior force, scattered and&#xD;
(1d in every direction,&#xD;
The General's observant eye had detected&#xD;
among the enemy some Cubans, whose faces&#xD;
were familiar to hih, and many of whom he&#xD;
ki new tm1 be pheged to the rising.&#xD;
The dis:ove ry startled and pained him, as&#xD;
it was an additional evidence that the Creoles&#xD;
had no irtienion of comtig up to the work of&#xD;
the Revolution.&#xD;

you into the expedition which he was gettin&#xD;
up for the invasion o'f Cuba. From that mo-&#xD;

neglect and abandonment, made me learn to&#xD;
- unlove and abhor you ; it was you who by&#xD;
0your filthy drunkenness compelled me to re.&#xD;

Fanny Gardner gazed upon the corse for&#xD;
a few minutes, with an air of thoughtful sin&#xD;
lence.&#xD;
In that fatal chair sat the clay of him who&#xD;
in other and sunnier days had won her heart,&#xD;
and :reathed into her credulous ear profes-&#xD;
sions of deepest love and constancy. To him&#xD;
she had confided her chances of life's happi-&#xD;
ness, in the fhd and firm belief that he would&#xD;
never prove recrennt to his trust. She had&#xD;
reposed upon his boson, in the earlier days of&#xD;
their marria4rs, happy i the thought that he&#xD;
would adhere, mid storm and sunshine to the&#xD;
promise he had made her that he would never&#xD;
love her less, that with the progress of time&#xD;
his already strong devotion would increase in&#xD;
its depth and strpnth. But had he kept that&#xD;
f)ledge ?  No; /it was scarcely made, ere it&#xD;
was broken I With satiety in passion his love&#xD;
grew cold, and he abandoned her whom he&#xD;
had is'suaded to become his partner in the&#xD;

what loss of property will compare with the&#xD;
less of a woman's happiness ? In the former&#xD;
case, dollars, if there be a sufficient number,&#xD;
will compensate the citizen for what he has&#xD;
sufTred at the hands of the burglar; but all&#xD;
the dollars in the world cannot restore to a&#xD;
woman's heart the peace , and happiness of&#xD;
which she has been robbed.&#xD;
And what a low-souled hound must that&#xD;
man be who can prefer the society of the&#xD;
loafers, thieves and drunkiards which infest&#xD;
rum holes and gambling hells to that of the&#xD;
pure, intelligent and loving being whom  he&#xD;
meanly leaves to pine and weep in her lone-&#xD;

and how openly he displays it, by leaving his&#xD;
virtuous home and publicly entering a rum&#xD;

her lot with the royalest queen in the world ;&#xD;

all the luxuries of earth at her beck, she is&#xD;
poorer than the poorest.&#xD;
And he is a brute who says she should put&#xD;
up with her wrongs without a murmur; he&#xD;
is a wretch who says she should endure in&#xD;
silence the base brutality of her betrayer&#xD;
he is himself a hound who says woman was&#xD;
made to submit quietly to him who beguiles&#xD;
her of her only treasure only to gratify his&#xD;

A citizen whose confidence is betrayed and&#xD;
himself ruined by the duplicity and villainy&#xD;
of one of hid fellows, would justly deem the&#xD;
wretch who has undone him as unfit to live,&#xD;
since the price of his existence is misery to&#xD;
others ; and society would exculpate him from&#xD;

he who breaks and drives it into crime and&#xD;
never-dying woe, should be made, in all cases,&#xD;
to pay pang for pang, misery for misery, and&#xD;
ruin for ruin, ever more.&#xD;
Such were the thoughts of Fanny Gard-&#xD;
ner, as she gazed upon the clay of him who&#xD;
was once her idol, now the object of her&#xD;
scorn--the victim in his turn of his victim.&#xD;
As she brought her reflections to a close,&#xD;
she gathered her veil over her face, and ap.&#xD;
proaching the door of the dungeon, pulled&#xD;
the cord communicating with the passage&#xD;
without.&#xD;
A minute later, she passed from the Punta,&#xD;
and entering her carriage, which stood in&#xD;
waiting, was whirled off to her hotel.&#xD;
On entering her room she found upon her&#xD;
&#xD;
table a passport and a small bag of doubloons.&#xD;
"The Captain General has kept his pro.&#xD;
mise !" she muttered. "lHe no doubt con.&#xD;
siders this gold the price of blood, I do not.&#xD;
REVENGE was the guerdon for which I bar.&#xD;
gained-revenge only, and Ihave had it !"&#xD;
The next day Fanny Gardner disappeared,&#xD;
and was never again seen in Havana. As&#xD;
she took the steamer which runs between&#xD;
that city, New Orleans and New.York, and&#xD;
did not debark at the crescent city, it is prob.&#xD;
able that she proceeded with the vessel to the&#xD;
metropolis of the Empire State, and there&#xD;
thlew herself into the great whirlpool of so.&#xD;
ciety, which contains thousands of women of&#xD;
