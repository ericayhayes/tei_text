NINA$ ATONEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER 1.&#xD;
NINA was nineteen on the 21st day of&#xD;
June. It was a glorious day for a birth-&#xD;
day, the young girl thought, as she stood on&#xD;
the terrace of Wyverne House, looking out&#xD;
over the picturesque country in the full beau-&#xD;
ty of its midsummer loveliness, the green,&#xD;
waving woods, the golden wheat-fields over&#xD;
which the soft breeze stole with a gentle,&#xD;
billowy swell, the stately old house standing&#xD;
with an air of conscious pride among its&#xD;
sentinel-trees, the garden abounding in sum-&#xD;
mer bloom and fragrance, the shrubbery full&#xD;
of green depths of shadowy coolness and&#xD;
stretches of velvet turf. Taken just then, it&#xD;
would have been hard to find a lovelier place,&#xD;
than this home of the Wyvernes; but Juan&#xD;
Fernandez was probably a lovely place, also,&#xD;
only4tbis fact did not prevcnt.Alexander Sel-&#xD;
kirk from finding it exceedingly dull-and&#xD;
scarcely less dull than Juan Fernandez was&#xD;
Wyverne House. As Nina stood on the ter-&#xD;
race, she~ was thinking, rather desponde~itly,&#xD;
of the monotonous years which stretched&#xD;
behind her, and of the equally monotonous&#xD;
ones which might lie in advance. It was not&#xD;
a very entrancing prospect; and, although.&#xD;
the girl was sufficiently of an optimist to ac-&#xD;
cept life as it had been given, it was impos.&#xD;
sible to avoid a feeling of blank weariness&#xD;
on this anniversary of birth, when one has a&#xD;
right to look existence in the face and ask&#xD;
what it has brought in the past; or is likely&#xD;
to bring in the future.&#xD;
The answer t'o these questions was brief&#xD;
&#xD;
enough, as far as she was concerned. It had&#xD;
brought food and rainiest, and a roof to shel-&#xD;
ter her, up to this date; it offered, with lavish&#xD;
generosity, the same good gifts for an indefi-&#xD;
nite length of time in the future. There are&#xD;
plenty~of people in the world-good, narrow.&#xD;
miitded, narrow-lived people-who would have&#xD;
thought such gifts all she could possibly need,&#xD;
and that to harbor even a longing for any&#xD;
thing beyond, for some gleam of that bright.&#xD;
ness so dear to the eager heart of youth, w~s&#xD;
rank discontent and ingratitude. Given "~&#xD;
comfortable home," nothing in particular to&#xD;
do, and not the faintest suspicion of unkind&#xD;
treatment to endure, and how could a girl, who&#xD;
had not a shilling in her own right, venture to&#xD;
expect or wish for more? How couldahe pos-&#xD;
sibly venture to indulge that desire for some-&#xD;
thing beyond the dry husks of life, which is&#xD;
common to all forms of buoyant youth, and&#xD;
which, however carefully it may be repressed,&#xD;
can never be wholly subdued until the apgthy&#xD;
of age comes to teach sometinie~ resignation,&#xD;
but more often the indifference that is born of&#xD;
hopelessness? Yet, it may be saidfor Ninathat&#xD;
she did not often indulge these wishes, hopes,&#xD;
regrets, or whatever, they might be called.&#xD;
They were uncomfortable, and the girl was&#xD;
too much of an epicurean to wflhipgly endure&#xD;
discomfort, much less to seek it. ~She chafed&#xD;
a little, sorpetimes, against the dull stagnation&#xD;
in which her youth aud heautyseemed strand-&#xD;
ed; but itwas easier ~o accept things ~s they&#xD;
came, and to content herself with her novelS,&#xD;
her tnusic, her dreams, and the few domestic&#xD;
occupations tl~t had fallen into her han4s.-&#xD;

NINA'S ATONEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
NINA'S ATONEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
very few they were, for Mrs. Wyverne was a&#xD;
notable housekeeper, with no fancy for shar-&#xD;
ing the reins of government. "It i~ a pity&#xD;
Nina is not more domestic," this lady often&#xD;
said but she had taken no pains to make&#xD;
Nina more domestic, even if any amount of&#xD;
pains would have accomplished that result-&#xD;
which is highly doubtful. And so the girl&#xD;
had dreamed and loitered her life away, until&#xD;
she waked with a start1 on her nineteenth&#xD;
birthday, to the realization that this monoto-&#xD;
ny was to make the suni of her existence in&#xD;
the future as entirely as it had made it in the&#xD;
past.&#xD;
Such a realization is always a shock, No&#xD;
life can be very irksome while there is hope&#xD;
of escape from it; but when we once realize&#xD;
that there is no escape-short of that dread&#xD;
change from which humanity recoils-we feel&#xD;
as if even that with which we were moderate.&#xD;
ly content yesterday had grown intolerable&#xD;
t*-day. Standing on the terrace that fair mid-&#xD;
summer day, some such phase of feeling came&#xD;
to Nina. She felt how hopelessly she was tied&#xD;
to the life which she had already begun to dis- 1&#xD;
like, and which abe' woujd probably end ~by&#xD;
loathing-and, feeling this, a sudden longing&#xD;
to escape came over her-a longing all the&#xD;
greater because there was scarcely any thing&#xD;
in the world less possible or less probable for&#xD;
her ~than escape. She was not only entirely&#xD;
dependent on the bounty of her uncle, but she&#xD;
had promised to marry his son. 'Now, this&#xD;
son-the only hope and heir of the honse of&#xD;
Wyverne-was, like all of his family, a model&#xD;
of domestic virtue. lie was one of the men&#xD;
to whom it would never occur that there was&#xD;
a 'duty In life beyond his well-tilled fields, or&#xD;
a pleasure beyond his hearthstone, and a cer-&#xD;
tain crotchet to be noticed hereafter; a man&#xD;
well kiiown through all the c~uhtry-side to&#xD;
be a walking~ bundle of gobd qualities, and&#xD;
eminently fitted to, make the happiness of a&#xD;
"home-loving" woman's life. What he was&#xD;
calculated to' be to a woman who was riot&#xD;
home-loving, it' is'.'scarcely worth while to&#xD;
say. If. we took the vote of the' world at&#xD;
large on the fate 'of' such women-such&#xD;
"monstrosities," Con li~, surrounded by her&#xD;
jewels, is fond of calling them-not the most&#xD;
truthful record of sufthring~ could alter the&#xD;
stern verdict "Served her zigliti"&#xD;
SuebTas he was, howevca, Ralph Wyverne&#xD;
had been 'engaged to his pretty, penniless&#xD;
cousin for s~veral months; and, asNina' st&amp;amp;od&#xD;
&#xD;
absently plucking at her engagement - ring,&#xD;
she was wondering if it was indeed true that&#xD;
she would be married before another moon&#xD;
had waxed and waned. "At least, that will&#xD;
be sons change!" she thought. And then&#xD;
she yawned. After all, would it be much&#xD;
more entertaining to live the same old life as&#xD;
Nina Wyverne than as Nina flalsell? It was&#xD;
a question which she did not choose to an.&#xD;
swer "Kismet!" she said, 4hrugging her&#xD;
shoulders. Then she turned and strolled&#xD;
toward the house.&#xD;
As she entered the ball, a servant, whom&#xD;
she met, told her that her cousin, who had&#xD;
been absent' for several days, had returned.&#xD;
"When' did he come?" she asked, indiffer-&#xD;
ently, as she took oil' her hat, pushing her&#xD;
hair from her face-flushed and overheated&#xD;
by her walk through the sun.&#xD;
"Half an hour ago, ma'am, and there's&#xD;
another gentleman with him," Price an-&#xD;
swered. '&#xD;
"Another gentleman with him 1" repeated&#xD;
Nina, and she frowned a little. It was not&#xD;
probable that Ealph'had brought another&#xD;
gentleman from the city,'where he had been&#xD;
on business.' At least, such an i4ea never oc-&#xD;
curred to her. It was one of the neighbors,&#xD;
no doubt, whom he had met as he drove over&#xD;
from the railroad.' ~' How provoking 1" she&#xD;
said, as she moved away, without giving Price&#xD;
any further opportunity for enlightening her.&#xD;
The neighbors, individually or collectively,&#xD;
represented to Nina every thing in the world&#xD;
-that is, in law world-most' tiresome. She&#xD;
knew 'every one of them so well, had been&#xD;
bored by every one of them so often, that she&#xD;
sighed with a dismal sense of coming weari-&#xD;
ness, as she crossed the hall toward the draw-&#xD;
ing-room, from which 'the sound of voices is-&#xD;
sued.&#xD;
And so, with a cloud of irnpatien~e, not so&#xD;
well concealed as it should have been, on her&#xD;
white brow, with her pretty hair carelessly&#xD;
'pushed back 'from her face, and the usual&#xD;
color on her cheeks deepened into the love-&#xD;
liest flush imaginable, she entered 'the room,&#xD;
where Ralph at once sprang eagerly to meet&#xD;
her, and where a bro~n.eyed, brown-haired,&#xD;
brown- mustached Stranger was talking to&#xD;
Mrs. Wyverne.&#xD;
"Oh I-not one of the neighbors, after&#xD;
all!" Nina thought, bestowing her first glance&#xD;
-as was natural enough-upon such a rare&#xD;
aria, as an uud~ubted and indisputable stran~&#xD;
&#xD;
ger was, at Wyverne House. "How d'ye do, ever, this i~ such an arbitrary term, that&#xD;

"We will go out tonight, and look for&#xD;
them," said Ralph. "Don't the old romances&#xD;
say that fairies hold a certain power over chit-&#xD;
dren born on the midsummer festival? Per.&#xD;
haps they will bring you a gift, Nina."&#xD;
"They have never done so, yet," said Ni-&#xD;
na, shrugging her shoulders. "It would be&#xD;
rather late to begin when one is nineteen-&#xD;
don't you think so, Mr. Martindale?"&#xD;
"is nineteen so venerable an age that it is&#xD;
the bound of all things?" asked Martindale,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
But he was sorry for h'av~ig yielded to the&#xD;
inclination when he saw Nina flush and turn&#xD;
away7 plainly offended. There was nothing&#xD;
which she disliked so much as being laughed&#xD;
aL it is not particularly agreeable to ~any.&#xD;
body; hut Nina had no great sense of humor,&#xD;
and a most especial dread of ridicule. "Your&#xD;
friend is very uncivil," she said to Ralph,&#xD;
who followed her to the window whither she&#xD;
walked.&#xD;
"lie did not mean to be uncivil," Wyverne&#xD;
said, apologetically. "I think you will'like&#xD;
him when you know him, Nina."&#xD;
"Shall I?" asked Nina, sarcastically.&#xD;
"It will be a remarkable fact, then, for I&#xD;
don't often like people, and I am sure I shall&#xD;
not like any chemical person. What made&#xD;
you bring him, Ralph? I think it was very&#xD;
disagreeable of you."&#xD;
"lie is such an old friend of mine," said&#xD;
Ralph, a little crestfallen. "And then the&#xD;
experiments, Nina I Martindale is a good&#xD;
practical chemist, which I am not; and he&#xD;
will know how far I am right and how far&#xD;
wrong."&#xD;
"I know that you are going to blow us&#xD;
all to atoms before you are done with your&#xD;
nonsense," Nina said, impatiently. "I really&#xD;
think that you ought to have more sense, and&#xD;
more regard for my wishes."&#xD;
"As for not having more sense, I can't&#xD;
help that, you know, dear," said Ralph, smil-&#xD;
ing; "while, as for your wishes-you will&#xD;
thank me for disregarding them when I make&#xD;
a fortune for you."&#xD;
"And what good would a dozen fortunes&#xD;
do me kere I" demanded impetuous Nina.&#xD;
"I have heard you say that you would not&#xD;
leave Wyverne if you were as rich as-as the&#xD;
Rothachilds! Besides, I don't believe in the&#xD;
fortune-it is all stuff! You are not thinking&#xD;
about it. You are only thinking about your&#xD;
horrid experiments."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I can't help liking them, you know," he&#xD;
said, with a ludicrous air of apology.&#xD;
And, although the fact should not have&#xD;
required an apology, it was true enough.&#xD;
Nature has strange freaks, and she had va-&#xD;
ried the dull monotony of the Wyverne race&#xD;
by developing an unsuspected man of science&#xD;
among them. If ever there was a born&#xD;
chemist, Ralph Wyverne was that man.&#xD;
From an early period of boyhood, he had&#xD;
dabbled in chemistry, had many times fright.&#xD;
ened the family out of their wits by untimely&#xD;
explosions, had turned his room at college&#xD;
into a laboratory, and since his return home&#xD;
devoted all his spare time to ~experiments&#xD;
which the family in general regarded very&#xD;
much as the people of the middle ages re-&#xD;
garded witchcraft and demonology. "The&#xD;
boy is crazy!" his father said, contemptu-&#xD;
ously, while Nina viewed the whole thing&#xD;
with unqualified impatience. "As if you had&#xD;
to earn your bread!" she would say, scorn.&#xD;
fully, to Ralph, and when he talked of science&#xD;
she only stopped her ears. Men of science&#xD;
in all ages have had to bear this kind of&#xD;
treatment, however, Wyverne consoled him-&#xD;
self by thinking; and having a great deal&#xD;
of obstinacy in a quiet way, as well as a&#xD;
great love for his "experiments," his chem-&#xD;
ical enthusiasm managed to survive it.&#xD;
It was a fact, significant of the narrow&#xD;
limits of his life, that the only person whom&#xD;
he had ever found to sympathize with him&#xD;
was the man he now introduced so unex-&#xD;
pectedly into his family circle-this Martin-&#xD;
dale, who had been an erratic but brilliant&#xD;
student of considerable promise when Ralph&#xD;
knew him at college, full of devotion to sci-&#xD;
ence, but full also of crude theories, wild&#xD;
enough to have exploded the whole system&#xD;
of chemistry as at present held and expound-&#xD;
ed. He had gained practical knowledge since&#xD;
that time in the laboratory of a distinguished&#xD;
German chemist; but, being a shrewd and&#xD;
clever thinker, he still inclined rather to the&#xD;
theoretical than the practical school. Too&#xD;
visionary, and too much a man of the world,&#xD;
to be ever eminent as a man of science, older&#xD;
chemists thought; but still, for so young a&#xD;
man, one or two lucky circumstances had al-&#xD;
ready given him an enviable reputation in his&#xD;
profession, and Ralph's faith in Martindale&#xD;
was scarcely less than his faith in Faraday.&#xD;
To Nina, however, his name only represented&#xD;
a great deal of boredom. Ralph, full of en-&#xD;
&#xD;
thusiasm for the talents of his friend, had&#xD;
insisted on reading to her one or two of his&#xD;
scientific articles, over which she had yawned&#xD;
dismally. She had heard so much of him in&#xD;
connection with retorts and crucibles, blow-&#xD;
pipes and gases, that she had drawn one of&#xD;
those lively fancy sketches in which we are&#xD;
all prone to indulge-a portrait of a tall,&#xD;
light-haired, round-shouldered student, afflict-&#xD;
ed with shyness and spectacles. She was&#xD;
particularly sure of the spectacles, and was,&#xD;
therefore, naturally surprised when she saw a&#xD;
slender, handsome, well - dressed man, who&#xD;
scanned her coolly with clear, brown eyes, full&#xD;
of keen observation and a dash of humor&#xD;
which she did, not fancy.&#xD;
After the affront he had so unwittingly&#xD;
given, she saw very little more of him for the&#xD;
rest of the morning. It cannot be said, how-&#xD;
cvcr, that this was her fault, or the fault of&#xD;
Martindale, either. The latter, being a man&#xD;
of taste as well as a chemist, would probably&#xD;
have liked to prosecute his acquaintance with&#xD;
the pretty, piquant face which had burst&#xD;
upon him so unexpectedly, and would car-&#xD;
tainly have preferred to spend the morning in&#xD;
the cool, dark, old-fashioned drawing-room,&#xD;
to broiling in an attic apartment which Ralph&#xD;
proudly called his laboratory. But he had no&#xD;
alternative of choice. To' Nina's indignation,&#xD;
Wyverne hurried off on the first decent pre-&#xD;
text to that chosen retreat of science, taking&#xD;
his friend along. "On my birthday, tool"&#xD;
she thought, angrily. Not that she honestly&#xD;
cared for her cousin's society-which more&#xD;
frequently wearied than interested~ her-but&#xD;
to be neglected at all was something which&#xD;
this unreasonable young lady could illy brook&#xD;
-and to be neglected for chemistry was in-&#xD;
supportable indeed.&#xD;
It must be recorded that she was mali-&#xD;
cious enough to feel a sensation of pleasure&#xD;
when she read "disappointed" legibly printed I&#xD;
on Ralph's countenance as she met, or, rath- I&#xD;
er, was overtaken by him on her way down-&#xD;
stairs before dinner.&#xD;
"I hope you have enjoyed your morn- I&#xD;
ing! she said, very stiffly, as he drew her&#xD;
hand into his arm; but, when she looked up&#xD;
into his face and saw the inscription already&#xD;
mentioned, she was sufficiently heartless to c&#xD;
laugh. "Dear mel I am afraid you have not&#xD;
enjoyed it, after all," she said.      I s&#xD;
"I am an ignorant fool, Nina," said poor I&#xD;
Ralph, humbly. "It was all a mistake, dear. t&#xD;
&#xD;
My experiments have come to nothing. Mar.&#xD;
iindale says the idea is a good one-I knew&#xD;
tkat-but the process has been all wrong. In&#xD;
fact, he thinks the result I wish to obtain im-&#xD;
practicable.".&#xD;
"Well, I hope you are satisfied I" said&#xD;
Nina, in a tone of triumph. "How often&#xD;
have I told you the same thing! But you&#xD;
only laughed at me, because I was not a&#xD;
chemist. Now that Mr. Martindale, who is a&#xD;
chemist, has told you that it is all nonsense,&#xD;
I hope you will throw all your things into the&#xD;
fire and have done with them."&#xD;
"That is asking rather too much of me,"&#xD;
said Ralph, laughing a little, despite his sore&#xD;
disappointment, and the still sorer sense of&#xD;
how little this disappointment was to the per-&#xD;
son who represented nil the sweetness and&#xD;
fairness of the world to him.&#xD;
At dinner, nothing further regarding the&#xD;
matter transpired, only Nina was rather more&#xD;
gracious to Mr. Martindale than she might&#xD;
otherwise have been. She was very much&#xD;
obliged to him for telling Ralph that his ob-&#xD;
noxious experiments amounted to "nothing,"&#xD;
and that the result which he wished to oh-&#xD;
tain-though what this result was, she had&#xD;
not the faintest idea-was "impracticable."&#xD;
It showed more sense than she had expected&#xD;
from anybody who was " a chemical person~~&#xD;
himself; and she manifested her apprecia-&#xD;
tion by a degree of affability which astonished&#xD;
Ralph, and amused Martindale not a little.&#xD;
She was quite a piquant study, the latter&#xD;
thought, with her petulance, her patronage,&#xD;
her insouciance, and her really striking beau-&#xD;
ty. Nina would have been enraged if she&#xD;
had known how well she was entertaining&#xD;
this student of chemistry and of human na-&#xD;
ture, unconsciously to herself.&#xD;
It chanced, however, that she was .~des-&#xD;
tined to entertain him still better-to give&#xD;
~im a still clearer insight into her character-...&#xD;
2efore the day was over. After the usual&#xD;
fiesta, horses were always brought to the&#xD;
loor at Wyverne House, and, as regularly as&#xD;
~he day showed neither rain nor clouds, ~Nina&#xD;
vent to ride-sometimes with R~lph, some-&#xD;
lines with her uncle, oftenest ~with both.&#xD;
)n the present afternoon, when she came&#xD;
lown in her habit, she found that Martindale&#xD;
ms to join the party. This might have been&#xD;
aid to be necessary-since it is a rule of civil.&#xD;
zed life that civilized people must go through&#xD;
he form of providing amusement for their&#xD;
&#xD;
NINA'S ATONEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8071-00000007"/>&#xD;
6                    NINA'S ATONEMENT.                                                      NiNA'S ATONEMENT.                   7&#xD;
&#xD;
guests-but at least it was not necessary for&#xD;
Ralph to have selected that particular occasion&#xD;
for reminding his father of certain lands which&#xD;
were to be cleared, and upon. which it was&#xD;
necessary to decide, involving a ride through&#xD;
a part of the plantation where neither Nina&#xD;
nor Martindale would have found any thing of&#xD;
interest.&#xD;
"~ If Martindale has no objection, you can&#xD;
fake him with you through the woods, Nina,"&#xD;
Ralph said, good-humoredly. "We will meet&#xD;
at the house."&#xD;
"Perhaps Mr. Martindale has an objec-&#xD;
tion," Nina demurred, looking with a spark&#xD;
of mischief in her eyes at that gentleman.&#xD;
"It is very likely," the latter answered,&#xD;
dryly; "I know so much about the clearing&#xD;
of lands, and would probably feel such a live.&#xD;
ly interest in them, that Ralph should certain-&#xD;
ly take me with him as final referee on any&#xD;
disputed point."&#xD;
"Oh, for the matter of that," said Miss&#xD;
Daizell, nonc~aIantIy, "we have nothing of&#xD;
special interest in the neighborhood. I can-&#xD;
not promise you a single interesting object or&#xD;
view; so, perhaps you might find it as enter-&#xD;
taining to hear Ralph and uncle discuss their&#xD;
fields, as to ride with inc through the woods&#xD;
and back again to the house."&#xD;
"Perhaps you would prefer the discussion&#xD;
yourself," he suggested.&#xD;
But she shrugged her shoulders.&#xD;
"I have listened to talk of that kind every&#xD;
afternoon for the last ten years," she said.&#xD;
"It has lost the merit of novelty, therefore,&#xD;
which I fancy is the only merit it could ever&#xD;
have possessed I am going this way," she&#xD;
added, turning her horse's head. "Of course&#xD;
you can come if you like."&#xD;
"Thanks," said he, amused by the gra-&#xD;
ciousness of the permission.&#xD;
They left the dusty high-road which they&#xD;
had been following, to enter a bridle-path,&#xD;
deeply arched over with shade, and looking&#xD;
as if it might have led into the heart of an&#xD;
enchanted forest.&#xD;
"Since this is Midsummer - Eve, we may&#xD;
hope to meet a fairy or two," Martindale said,&#xD;
after a while.&#xD;
"Let us also hope, then, that they will&#xD;
bring me the gift of which Ralph spoke this&#xD;
morning," said Nina, with a slight, wistful&#xD;
sigi).&#xD;
Slight as it was, this sigh did not escape&#xD;
the quick ear of her companion. He won-&#xD;
&#xD;
dered a little what it meant, and, being fond&#xD;
of studying any problem which chance threw&#xD;
in his way, it occurred to him that it might&#xD;
be worth while to discover the cause of that&#xD;
soft inspiration.&#xD;
"I fear that you would not be a fit recipi-&#xD;
ent for fairy bounty," he said, smiling. "If&#xD;
I met a prince, arrayed in the traditional green&#xD;
and gold hunting-suit, riding along just now,&#xD;
I should be more inclined to doff my hat in&#xD;
salute, than to offer him charity."&#xD;
"I am stupid, I suppose," said Nina, "but&#xD;
I don't see the force of the comparison. How&#xD;
am Ilike the prince, or how would the fairies&#xD;
be like you?"&#xD;
"The fairies would only be like me inas-&#xD;
much as, meeting you, they would probably&#xD;
say, 'She was born on our festival, but what&#xD;
can we bestow on her now that was not be-&#xD;
stowed at her birth? She has beauty, wit,&#xD;
wealth, the charm to win and to keep love-.&#xD;
what more can we give, with all our pow-&#xD;
er?'"&#xD;
"That is very pretty," said Nina, coldly;&#xD;
"but you see the fairies-if they were fairies&#xD;
-would know better than that. Instead of&#xD;
paying me empty compliments, they would&#xD;
know that there is a great deal they could&#xD;
give-for which I should be very thankful."&#xD;
" I suppose nobody is ever entirely pleased&#xD;
with his lot in life," said Martindale, philo-&#xD;
sophically, "but I should have been tempted&#xD;
to suppose that if anybody ever is satisfied,&#xD;
it might have been yourself."&#xD;
"Whos~ you have known since eleven&#xD;
o'clock this morning!" said she, with a&#xD;
laugh. "Do you usually decide upon peo-&#xD;
pie's 'lot in life' so promptly, Mr. Martin.&#xD;
dale? If so, you must possess either excep-&#xD;
tional powers of judgment, or exceptional&#xD;
confidence in your own acuteness."&#xD;
The mockery of her tone pleased rather&#xD;
than provoked her listener, lie laughed a&#xD;
little himself as he turned in his saddle and&#xD;
looked at her, admiring the graceful, stately&#xD;
figure-Nina was " a woman with a presence,~&#xD;
-the bright face vivid with color, the lovely&#xD;
eyes full of malicious amusement. "How&#xD;
pretty she is I" he thought, "and what a&#xD;
spice of the devil she has I ".&#xD;
"It does not follow that I possess either&#xD;
exceptional powers of judgment or excep-&#xD;
tional confidence in my own acuteness, be-&#xD;
cause I have been able to read at first sight&#xD;
some features of your life," he said aloud.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I should be blind as well as dull if I did&#xD;
not read them."&#xD;
"It does not follow that, because you&#xD;
have read you have understood," said she,&#xD;
falling into his trap with a facility that grati-&#xD;
fied him.&#xD;
"Nothing could be more true," said he.&#xD;
"It does not, of course, follow that, because&#xD;
1 have read, I have understood; but neither&#xD;
does it follow that, because I have read, I&#xD;
have not understood."&#xD;
"And yet," said she, with another laugh-&#xD;
this time a little bitter--" you think my life&#xD;
so perfect that, if 1 were to meet a fairy at&#xD;
this moment, there is nothing she could pos-&#xD;
sibly need to give me!"&#xD;
"Nay," said he-and in the deep, wood-i&#xD;
land stillness through which they were riding,&#xD;
his voice seemed full of a sudden expression&#xD;
which thrilled her-" I did not mean to im-&#xD;
ply that your life was perfect. I said that.&#xD;
you had many gifts-it is true, is it not?-&#xD;
but one may lack as well as possess. Indeed,&#xD;
in lacking some things, one lacks all things;&#xD;
and content is one of them."&#xD;
It was a shrewd guess, and one which&#xD;
made Nina flush up to her temples-angry&#xD;
with him for speaking so plainly, angry with&#xD;
herself for having betrayed so much.&#xD;
"I fancy content is one of the things&#xD;
which we all lack," said she, trying to answer&#xD;
indifferently. "All of us find monotony un-&#xD;
pleasant, all of us think that we should like&#xD;
to season our lives with a little more spice.&#xD;
Color, zest, perfume, as the French say-some&#xD;
of our lives lack all of these things horribly;&#xD;
hut probably they will go on lacking them to&#xD;
the end."&#xD;
"Why should they?" he asked-adding,&#xD;
as he turned and looked at him, "you must&#xD;
pardon me if I say that some people arc born&#xD;
for a groove, but you are not one of them."&#xD;
"How do you know what 1 was born for?"&#xD;
asked Nina, curtly. "I did not say I was not&#xD;
very well satisfied with my life. At least"&#xD;
(shrugging her shoulders slightly), "if I were&#xD;
not willing to live always at Wyverne, I&#xD;
should scarcely be engaged to marry with&#xD;
Ralph."&#xD;
"And do you think that to live always at&#xD;
Wyverne will satisfy you in the future, even&#xD;
though it may "-a doubtful accent here-&#xD;
"have done so in the past?"&#xD;
She laughed - a slightly forced effort.&#xD;
There was something in the tone of the ques-&#xD;
&#xD;
1 tion, as well as in the intent gaze of the brown&#xD;
eyes looking at her, which made her a little&#xD;
nervous. They were riding just then through&#xD;
a ravine, where a green, dusky gloaming,&#xD;
inexpressifily full of fantastic suggestions,&#xD;
reigned. If she had done what was wise, if&#xD;
she had even done what instinct prompted,&#xD;
she would have waived the question which&#xD;
Martindale had no possible right to ask.&#xD;
But a sudden, reckless impulse made her an-&#xD;
swer it in words which she was afterward&#xD;
destined to remember and repent.&#xD;
"Are you a fairy?" she said. "Fairies&#xD;
sometimes conic under strange disguises.&#xD;
Have you the power to spirit me away from&#xD;
Wyverne if I should confess that its monot-&#xD;
ony has grown almost intolerable to me?"&#xD;
"This is Midsummer. Day," and fairies,&#xD;
as you say, come under strange disguises&#xD;
sometimes. If you would believe in me, there&#xD;
is no telling what I might not do. I might&#xD;
even spirit you away to a world where you&#xD;
would be happy. But, in all ages, enchanters&#xD;
have demanded trust."&#xD;
"Which I am not ready to give," said&#xD;
Nina, feeling that this had gon~ too far. It&#xD;
was pleasant-it had a flavor of that spice&#xD;
which she desired-but still she felt that Mr.&#xD;
Martindale's glances and Mr. Martindalc's&#xD;
tones would not have elicited Ralph's appro-&#xD;
bation, if he had seen or heard them; and,&#xD;
foolish and reckless though she was, the girl&#xD;
meant to he honest, after a somewhat blun-&#xD;
dering and indefinite fashion.&#xD;
Perhaps you will give it after a time,~~&#xD;
the would-be enchanter said, quietly. "Mean-&#xD;
while, I should like you to remember that out-&#xD;
lives cre what we ma/ce them."&#xD;
"I don't believe it," said she, scornfully.&#xD;
"Or, if it is true at all, it is true only of men&#xD;
-never of women. Circumstances make us."&#xD;
"That is only because you do not know&#xD;
how to take advantage of them," said he,&#xD;
coolly.&#xD;
But this provoked Nina, who knew how&#xD;
arbitrary the circumstances of her life had&#xD;
been.&#xD;
"You only say so because you I/ave never&#xD;
known what they really are," she retorted.&#xD;
"I agree with the writer who said that if a&#xD;
letter were written to Circumstances, and sub-&#xD;
scribed 'Your obedient servant,' the vast ma-&#xD;
jority of mankind could sign it with tue&#xD;
greatest truthfulness."&#xD;
"It is certainly true that we are often in-&#xD;

&#xD;
debated to them for some very good gifts,"&#xD;
said he. "It hung, for instance, o~i a turn&#xD;
of chance, yesterday, whether or not I should&#xD;
come down here with Ralph. If I had not&#xD;
done so-"&#xD;
"You would have been spared the neces-&#xD;
sity of blasting poor Ralph's hopes about his&#xD;
cherished 'idea,"' said Nina, laughing.&#xD;
He started. "Have I blasted his hopes?"&#xD;
he asked. Then he, too, laughed a little--&#xD;
not a pleasant laugh, the girl thought.&#xD;
"Such hopes are easily revived ag~in," he&#xD;
said. "There ia nothing on~earth so hard to&#xD;
kill as an inventor's fancy."&#xD;
Something in his tone, as well as in his&#xD;
laugh, struck Nina unpleasantly, but she did&#xD;
not answer-perhaps because they emerged,&#xD;
just then, out of the dusky forest to an open&#xD;
space, where they saw&#xD;
"The flower-like sunset shed Its mystic blooms"&#xD;
over t~he broad fields, the shadowy woods, a&#xD;
winding road in the distance where some cat-&#xD;
tie lingered, green hills near at hand melting&#xD;
into blue ones afar off, valleys bright with&#xD;
streams which caught the reflection of the&#xD;
gorgeous west, and purple hollows where&#xD;
night seemed already to have gathered.&#xD;
There were few sounds to break the stillness&#xD;
only the soft music of falling water, the&#xD;
distant tinkle of a cow-bell, the note of a&#xD;
mocking-bird, or the coo of a wood-pigeon.&#xD;
"Is it not lovely ?"Nina said, leaning her&#xD;
elbow on the pommel of her saddle and her&#xD;
cheek on her hand.&#xD;
"Very lovely 1" her companion answered,&#xD;
and something in his tone made her glance&#xD;
quickly round. Then she saw that he was&#xD;
looking, not at the sunset scene, but at her-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
"Tun moon has not risen yet, Nina," said&#xD;
Ralph, "but the starlight is beautiful. Shall&#xD;
we go out and see if we can find the elfin&#xD;
folk?"&#xD;
Tea was ovnr, and they were gathered in the&#xD;
drawing-room-all somewhat dull and some-&#xD;
what stiff--when he made this proposal. Mrs.&#xD;
Wyverne was crocheting by the shaded lamp,&#xD;
round which a few moths wore circling; Mr.&#xD;
Wyverne was posing to Martiadale, who&#xD;
looked as much bored as a well-bred man&#xD;
ever permits himself to appear; Nina had&#xD;
&#xD;
been singing, but she i~osc from the piano,&#xD;
and, walking to one of the large, open win-&#xD;
dows, stood looking wistfully out, when Ralph&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
"Yes," she answered, eagerly. "Let us&#xD;
go on the terrace. If we don't find Queen&#xD;
Titania and her court, we shall, at least, find&#xD;
freshness and coolness."&#xD;
"Martindale, will you come?" said Ralph,&#xD;
raising his voice; and he did not understand&#xD;
why Nina frowned so quickly and sharply at&#xD;
the words.&#xD;
"You will find me on the terrace," she&#xD;
said; and, stepping through the window, she&#xD;
walked away-a tall, straight, white-clad fig-&#xD;
ure, soon lost to sight in the starlit gloom.&#xD;
Martindale left Mr. Wyverne with a scarce-&#xD;
ly intelligible excuse, and crossed the room.&#xD;
"Where is it you wish to go?" he said to&#xD;
Ralph, who was standing with a rather blank&#xD;
expression of countenance where he had been&#xD;
left.&#xD;
"Only out on the terrace for some fresh&#xD;
air," the other answered. " Will you come?&#xD;
It is very warm, and not particularly enter-&#xD;
taining, in here."&#xD;
"Is that where Miss DaIzell has gone?"&#xD;
"Yea She said we would find her there."&#xD;
"Lead on," said Martindale, cheerfully.&#xD;
"One certainly does prefer to enjoy summer&#xD;
nights a!f~-esco."&#xD;
They stepped out of the window and&#xD;
walked around the terrace for some distance,&#xD;
but they found no sign of Nina. The moon,&#xD;
as Ralph hail said, was not yet risen, but the&#xD;
soft, clear starlight rendered all immediate&#xD;
objects sufficiently distinct. It was one of&#xD;
those glowing, brilliant nights which only&#xD;
midsummer gives, the purple skies ablaze&#xD;
with radiance arching from horizon to hori-&#xD;
zon, the earth dark, fragrant, full of mystery,&#xD;
yet touched with a tender, delicate lustre.&#xD;
"Nina must have gone down into the gar-&#xD;
den," Ralph said, after a while.&#xD;
"Never mind Miss DaIzell just now,"&#xD;
Martindale responded, in rather a peculiar&#xD;
voice. "We will find her in a moment.&#xD;
Meanwhile, I have something to say to you&#xD;
about-that idea of yours. Perhaps I was a&#xD;
little hasty in what I told you this morning.&#xD;
I have been thinking it over since then. ~l&#xD;
should like to examine your notes again.&#xD;
Perhaps, after all, it may be possible to per-&#xD;
fect it." -&#xD;
He spoke awkwardly and constrainedly-..&#xD;
&#xD;
like a man who was bot certain how much he&#xD;
wished to say or leave unsaid-but Ralph was&#xD;
too full of delighted surprise to notice or at-&#xD;
tach any significance to his manner.&#xD;
"My dear fellow," he answered, eagerly,&#xD;
"you cannot tell how glad I am to hear you&#xD;
say that! I am a fool, I suppose, but I have&#xD;
dreamed and experimented over that idea so&#xD;
long, that it went hard with me when you said&#xD;
it was impracticable. I know that I have ut-&#xD;
terly failed in working it out; but I am only&#xD;
a dabbler in chemistry. If you take it in&#xD;
hand, now-"&#xD;
"I may fail as completely as you have&#xD;
done," Martindale interrupted, shortly and&#xD;
almost, sternly. "You must not hope any&#xD;
thing from my experiments-at least, not&#xD;
much. 1 am only a dabbler, and an erratic&#xD;
one, myself. Still, 1 will take the idea, and&#xD;
try to work it out, if you say so."&#xD;
"Of course I say so 1" Wyverne said, with&#xD;
a ring of enthusiasm in his tone which his&#xD;
companion knew well. He had heard it in&#xD;
the voices of others, and in his own, many&#xD;
times. It was a token of the fever which&#xD;
science can beget as well as art. "You can-&#xD;
not tell how infinitely I shall hold myself your&#xD;
debtor," lialph went on; "and, if you succeed,&#xD;
there is a fortune in it for both of us."&#xD;
"Nature is certainly a royal paymistress,"&#xD;
said the other; "but I have told you not to&#xD;
hope for success. Honestly, I think I shall&#xD;
fail, but I cannot be content until I have fairly&#xD;
tested the idea, now that you lave put it into&#xD;
my head."&#xD;
"It is a good idea," said Ralph, "I al-&#xD;
ways knew t1~at. And if we succeed in work-&#xD;
ing it out-"&#xD;
"But it will require time," the other in-&#xD;
terrupted again. "You must remember that.&#xD;
You must be prepared for labor, for failure,&#xD;
and for discouragements. No great discov-&#xD;
ery was ever perfected without all of these."&#xD;
"I am aware of it," said Ralph, "and if&#xD;
you give me a grain of. hope, no labor an4&#xD;
discouragements can daunt me, As for time,&#xD;
it is all before us-at least, as much of it as&#xD;
you can spare. I am to be married next&#xD;
month,'~' said he, laughing a little, "but that&#xD;
need not interfere with our experiments to&#xD;
any great extent."&#xD;
"~ You are to be married next month, are&#xD;
you?" said Martindale, starting. "So soon&#xD;
as that?"&#xD;
"There is no need for delay," answered&#xD;
&#xD;
Ralph. "I have no fancy for a long engage.&#xD;
ment. Besides, in this instance, there would&#xD;
be no sense in it. Neither Nina nor I have&#xD;
any thing for which to wait."&#xD;
"Very true," said Martindale, absently.&#xD;
He said nothing more, and, having now&#xD;
paced the entire length of the terrace, they&#xD;
descended a flight of stone steps which led&#xD;
down into the garden-a dim, mysterious re-&#xD;
gion, full of white paths, the dark outlines&#xD;
of shrubs, trim, old-fashioned borders, and&#xD;
many sweet-smelling flowers, filling the sum-&#xD;
mer night with incense. "What a charming&#xD;
place!" Martindale exclaimed.&#xD;
"I cannot imagine what has become of&#xD;
Nina," said Ralph, peering about through the&#xD;
shaded&#xD;
"Who is that?" asked his companion, as&#xD;
a white figure slowly moved across the path,&#xD;
some distance ahead of them, and vanished&#xD;
behind a hedge.&#xD;
"I did not see," said Ralph. "Was it&#xD;
Nina'? Which way did she go?'~&#xD;
The other answered by indicating the di-&#xD;
rection, and, when they reached the intersect-&#xD;
ing path along which the figure had passed,&#xD;
they turned and followed it.&#xD;
But they found no sign of the girl whom&#xD;
they were seeking. "She must have gone&#xD;
back to the house," Ralph said, after a while,&#xD;
taking out his cigar-case, and offering it to&#xD;
his companion. "There is no need that we&#xD;
should go," he added. "It is cooler out&#xD;
here."&#xD;
Martindale, however, had not come into&#xD;
the garden to smoke a cigar, and talk chemi-&#xD;
cal "shop." He declined the first by a gest-&#xD;
ure, and was on the point of cutting short&#xD;
the latter by saying that he, too, would return&#xD;
to the house, when a turn of the path sud-&#xD;
denly brought them in sight of a building&#xD;
the outlines of which cut sharply against the&#xD;
purple, starry sky.&#xD;
"What is this?" he asked, carelessly.&#xD;
"It is an old-fashioned summer-house,"&#xD;
Ralph answered. "You see every thing here&#xD;
is old-fashioned. This is one of the pavil-&#xD;
ionS in which our grandmothers used to take&#xD;
a sociable dish of coffee. It is not very orna-&#xD;
mental when you see it in daylight; but, for&#xD;
the sake of old association, my father has let&#xD;
it stay. It leaks, and the roof gave symptoms&#xD;
of falling in, the last I heard of it, however."&#xD;
"It is not ugly," said a quiet voice, which&#xD;
startled them both as it spoke out of the&#xD;

&#xD;
shadow of the building they had now ap-&#xD;
proached. "It is so prettily covered, with&#xD;
ivy, rut out your hand, Mr. Martindale, and&#xD;
you can feel the leaves."&#xD;
"Is it you, Nina-or a fairy?" Ralph&#xD;
said, putting out his hand and touching the&#xD;
white figure which they now discerned, sitting&#xD;
on a flight of steps that led from the door&#xD;
of the summer-house to the ground.&#xD;
"Are fairies ever so large?" asked Nina,&#xD;
laughing, and she rose as she spoke. Despite&#xD;
the discrepancy of size, both the young men&#xD;
thought that there was something elfin-like&#xD;
in the graceful, swaying figure, as it emerged&#xD;
from the deeper shadows into the soft star.&#xD;
light. "If the summer-house is old-fash-&#xD;
ioned, it is very pleasant," she went on, turn-&#xD;
ing to Martiadale. "I come and sit in here&#xD;
~Cteu. flee I it is a regular house."&#xD;
She mounted the steps and pushed open a&#xD;
door, as she spoke. Martindele followed her,&#xD;
and, being a smoker, soon found a match in&#xD;
his pocket, with which he struck a light. By&#xD;
this short-lived illumination he saw that they&#xD;
were in a pavilion somewhat on the Dutch&#xD;
model-a "regular house," as Nina had said~&#xD;
with two doors and two casements, also a&#xD;
table and chair bearing token to recent oc-&#xD;
cupation. "One could be very comfortable&#xD;
here," he said, reflectively. Then, as the&#xD;
match went out, leaving them in darkness, he&#xD;
turned to Ralph.&#xD;
"Wyverne," he said, "I wonder you have&#xD;
never lMdo lids into a laboratory. It is true&#xD;
it is not so convenient as your room in the&#xD;
house, - but you would be more at ease in&#xD;
your experiments; and when such things as&#xD;
explosions occur, nobody's nerves need be&#xD;
jarred."&#xD;
"More at ease in his experiments I" said&#xD;
Nina, quickly, before Ralph could speak.&#xD;
"But we are done with all such tiresome&#xD;
things as those. Ralph is not going to worry&#xD;
over chemistry itny more, since you have told&#xD;
him that his idea is impracticable-are you,&#xD;
Ralph?"&#xD;
"I am afraid I must say yes, Ninetta,"&#xD;
answered Ralph, with a laugh, half pleased,&#xD;
half ashamed. "Martindale has retracted his&#xD;
severe judgment on my poor idea-at least,&#xD;
he thinks there is' a chance for it, and of&#xD;
course I am anxious that he should put this&#xD;
chance to the test,"&#xD;
"A chance for it I" repeated Nina, and&#xD;
there was a sudden jarring quiver in her voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'ray when did Mr. Martindale discover&#xD;
this fact?" she asked, after a moment. "You&#xD;
certainly told me before dinner-"&#xD;
"I remember what I told you before din-&#xD;
ner," said Ralph, "but since we came out of&#xD;
the house, Martindale has told me that he was&#xD;
too hasty, and that there may be some hope&#xD;
for me after all."&#xD;
He spoke lightly, as if he were more&#xD;
amused than concerned by ler possible vexa-&#xD;
tion-but he was not exactly prepared for the&#xD;
answer that came.&#xD;
"Mr. Martindale seems to know his own&#xD;
mind very little," said Nina, coldly. "Of&#xD;
course the experiments and every thing con-&#xD;
nected with them are your own affair, Ralph;&#xD;
but I confess that, if I were in your place, I&#xD;
should feel very little confidence in the opin-&#xD;
ion of n person who contradicts himself in&#xD;
the most positive manner within the space of&#xD;
a few hours."&#xD;
"You don't understand, Nina," said Ralph.&#xD;
He was astonished, and for the moment al-&#xD;
most angry. He was well aware that his ex-&#xD;
periments did not please this arbitrary young&#xD;
princess, but he had not expected that her&#xD;
resentment would extend to one whose only&#xD;
fault had been that of encouraging him.&#xD;
"You don't understand," he repeated. "Mar.-&#xD;
tindale has thought the matter over, and,&#xD;
on consideration, changed his mind far enough&#xD;
to think that the idea may be worth testing.&#xD;
That is all."&#xD;
"I thought that changing one's mind was&#xD;
a frivolous thing only fit for women," said&#xD;
Nina. "Are chemists subject to it also?"&#xD;
"It is like discontent, inasmuch as we&#xD;
are all subject to it more or less, I fancy,"&#xD;
said Martindale, quietly.&#xD;
Then there w.'is a pause. They were stand-&#xD;
ing in darkness, for the faint glimmer which&#xD;
the stars sent through the casements was&#xD;
only sufficient to show the vague outline of&#xD;
Nina's white dress. Voices have a certain&#xD;
intensified meaning at such a time. When&#xD;
our observation is not distracted by any play&#xD;
of feature or expression of glance, we appre-&#xD;
ciate the wonderful organ of human speech&#xD;
as it deserves; our ears seem more finely&#xD;
strung, our attention is more concentrated,&#xD;
and catch many subtle inflections which, in&#xD;
the light of day, escape our notice. Even&#xD;
when Martindale spoke after a minute to&#xD;
Ralph, his voice had still a cadence of signifi-&#xD;
cance under its commonplace words.&#xD;
&#xD;
"The experiments will only require&#xD;
rifling outlay of time and labor," he said&#xD;
"and I cannot help thinking that this pan]&#xD;
ion is excellently adapted to our purpose ai&#xD;
a laboratory. I should not imagine tha&#xD;
many repairs were needed, and the chemical&#xD;
appar'atus can easily be removed."&#xD;
"It is a capital idea," said Ralph. "1&#xD;
wonder I never thought of it before. Thai&#xD;
room I have in the house is very inconvenient,&#xD;
As you say, few repairs are needed her&amp;amp;&#xD;
will send for Jackson to-morrow, and let hhz&#xD;
look at it. Nine, do these doors latch?&#xD;
must ride over to Elkbridge for some locks."&#xD;
"Is it the transmutation of metals that&#xD;
you have in hand ?" asked Nina, in her scorn-&#xD;
ful voice. "If not, I don't think you need&#xD;
guard your treasures so vigilantly. Nobody&#xD;
is likely to steal them."&#xD;
"But somebody might be injured by&#xD;
them," said Ralph, gravely. "Many of my&#xD;
chemicals are deadly poisons. It is always&#xD;
safest to guard against accidents."&#xD;
"You may at least be sure that I shall&#xD;
never trouble them," said she, turning away&#xD;
and walking toward the door.&#xD;
The movement was so abrupt, that the&#xD;
two young men hesitated n ~nornent whether&#xD;
or not to follow,&#xD;
"We have seen all that can be seen in&#xD;
such a light as this-don't you think we'd bet-&#xD;
ter go?" said Ralph, after a second, in a tone&#xD;
of carelessness a trifle studied.&#xD;
"I think I'll explore the garden a little&#xD;
further," the other answered. "May I trou-&#xD;
ble you for the cigar you offered a while ago?&#xD;
TI)anks! make my excuses to your cousin, if&#xD;
any excuses are necessary. If I am back in&#xD;
the drawing-room within an hour, it will be&#xD;
time enough to say good-night, will it not?"&#xD;
"Quito time enough," Ralph replied.&#xD;
lie said nothing more, and Martindale-&#xD;
having lighted his cigar-marched out of the&#xD;
pavilion by a door opposite that through&#xD;
which Miss DaIzell had disappeared.&#xD;
That young lady was strolling slowly along&#xD;
a path which led toward the house, when her&#xD;
cousin overtook her. She was surprised to&#xD;
see him alone, and, before she remembered&#xD;
the superior dignity of silence, had asked,&#xD;
"Where is Mr. Martindale?"&#xD;
"He has gone off to smoke a cigar," Ralph&#xD;
answered. "I suppose he thought it the best&#xD;
way of relieving you of his society I really&#xD;
think, Nina," this mildest of future husbands&#xD;
&#xD;
a ventured to add, "that you might treat a man&#xD;
, who is at once my friend an6 my guest a little&#xD;
more courteously."&#xD;
a "Have I treated Mr. Martindale with any&#xD;
t want of courtesy?" asked Nina, haughtily.&#xD;
1 She was not accustomed to being taken to&#xD;
task by anybody, but least of all by Ralph.&#xD;
"You have certainly treated him with&#xD;
very great want of courtesy," Wyverne an-&#xD;
swered, firmly. "You were absolutely rude&#xD;
in what you said a little while ago-and all&#xD;
because the poor fellow has encouraged me&#xD;
in the chemical pursuits for which you have&#xD;
such an aversion l"&#xD;
"You are mistaken," said Nina. She did&#xD;
Dot speak angrily as he had expected, but&#xD;
quite gravely. "You are mistaken," she re-&#xD;
peated, after a moment. "If I have been rude&#xD;
to Mr. Martindale, it was not because he has&#xD;
encouraged you in your chemical pursuits,&#xD;
but because I do not think he is sincere in&#xD;
doing so 1 1 do not think that he has any&#xD;
better opinion of your idea now than he had&#xD;
before dinner."&#xD;
"But what possible reason have you for&#xD;
thinking such a thing?" asked Ralph, sur-&#xD;
prised and displeased.&#xD;
"I can scarcely tell you," said she, stop.&#xD;
ping short and looking at him~ "I know&#xD;
you think I am prejudiced," she added, "but&#xD;
I had an instinct the moment I looked at him&#xD;
that he was not to be trusted. Ralph "-she&#xD;
put out her hand suddenly and laid it on his&#xD;
arm-" make your experiments yourself, and I&#xD;
will never say a word about them again--&#xD;
never I But don't give this man an excuse&#xD;
for staying an hour longer than you can help,&#xD;
at Wyverne House 1"&#xD;
"Nina, you astonish me I" said Ralph--&#xD;
which was certainly true. "I had no idea&#xD;
you could be so prejudiced and so unjust I&#xD;
How can you fancy that you, who have known.&#xD;
Martindale only a few hours, can possibly&#xD;
judge of his character better than I who have&#xD;
known him for years?"&#xD;
"I don't fancy it," said Nina. "I know&#xD;
nothing about his character-I don't care to&#xD;
know any thing. I only feel that he is not to&#xD;
be trusted, and I wish you would Aend him&#xD;
away.~~&#xD;
"Send him away I Send away a man who&#xD;
is my guest, because you have an idea that&#xD;
he is not to be trusted 1" said Ralph, quite&#xD;
aghast. "Nina, are you crazy, to ask such a&#xD;
thing?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"No, I sin not crazy, but you will be sor-&#xD;
ry ir you do not heed mel" said Nina, with a&#xD;
sudden, passionate meaning in her voice which&#xD;
made her cousin fear that she really was dis-.&#xD;
traught. "I am sure of that, Ralph. You&#xD;
will be sorry if' you do not heed me I"&#xD;
"Why should I be sorry?" demanded&#xD;
Ralph. "Such prejudice is not only absurd,&#xD;
but really beneath you, Nina. Can you not&#xD;
see that there is no reason in it? No man is&#xD;
deceitful without a motive. Now, what mo-&#xD;
tive could Martindale possibly have for de-&#xD;
ceiving me about my idea?"&#xD;
"Do you always distrust an effect when&#xD;
you don't know the cause of it?" asked~&#xD;
Nina.&#xD;
"When an effect is alleged, for which&#xD;
there is no adequate cause, I doubt its exist-&#xD;
ence assuredly," he answered.&#xD;
She shrugged her shoulders, and, takingher&#xD;
hand from his arm, gathered up the folds of her&#xD;
muslin dress, which she had suffered to fall&#xD;
unheeded on the dewy path.&#xD;
"It is no affair of mine," she said. "Of&#xD;
course yOu will do as you please; but I have&#xD;
warned you. You may be sorry yet that you&#xD;
have not heeded my warning, foolish as you&#xD;
think it. I distrust the man and every thing&#xD;
about him," she went on, with a certain re-&#xD;
pressed vehemence. "Ralph, you may think&#xD;
me absurdly superstitious, but when he first&#xD;
turned to you and spoke of converting the&#xD;
summer-house into a laboratory, something&#xD;
in hIs manner, in his tone-I c~snnot tell you&#xD;
what it was-made that sudden cold thrill&#xD;
come over me which people are said to feel&#xD;
when standing on the place where they will&#xD;
die,"&#xD;
"I do, indeed, think that you are absurd-&#xD;
ly superstitious," said Ralph, trying to speak&#xD;
lightly, for even by the dim light of the stars&#xD;
he saw that she was shivering violently;&#xD;
"but I think the best remedy will be to go&#xD;
into the house and try to forget all this. It&#xD;
is thorough nonsense, and you will like Mar-&#xD;
tindale as much as I do when you come to&#xD;
know him. I am sure of that 1"&#xD;
"Are you?" said Nina. She did not&#xD;
speak sarcastically, as she had done in the&#xD;
morning, but half dreamily. Then she turned,&#xD;
without saying sny thing more, and walked&#xD;
with him to the house.&#xD;
The next day Ralph went eagerly to work&#xD;
with the repairs necessary for converting the&#xD;
garden pavilion into a laboratory. Before&#xD;
&#xD;
breakfast he had sent for the best carpenter&#xD;
on the plantation, and held a consultation&#xD;
with him in front of the edifice in question-&#xD;
a consultation which greatly excited the sur-&#xD;
prise of Mr. Wyverne, who observed it while&#xD;
he was dressing, and, as soon as he was in a&#xD;
condition to emerge from his chamber, sallied&#xD;
down into the garden to demand an explana-&#xD;
tion from his son. To say that he was dis-&#xD;
gusted with the explanati6n, would be to say&#xD;
very little. He did not express this disgust&#xD;
to any great extent, however, because he was&#xD;
a reasonable man, in the first place, and a&#xD;
man of few words, in the second. Ralph was&#xD;
old enough to know what he was about, and,&#xD;
if he had a fancy to make a fool of hims~lf~ it&#xD;
was nobody's business but his own. That&#xD;
was Mr. Wyverne's view of the matter. As&#xD;
for Ralph, he had not expected any encour-&#xD;
agement; so the lack of it did not depress&#xD;
him. Nothing but good-natured tolerance,&#xD;
largely flavored with ridicule, had ever been&#xD;
given by the domestic world to his scientific&#xD;
experiments; and he looked for nothing else.&#xD;
Sympathy and encouragement would have&#xD;
surprised him as much as any attempt at&#xD;
arbitrary interference. Mr. Wyverne gave a&#xD;
long whistle when he heard for what purpose&#xD;
the summer-house was to he repaired. "I&#xD;
hope you will finish the business in two&#xD;
days," he said. "I can't spare Jackson&#xD;
longer. After all, perhaps it is a good idea.&#xD;
If you blow this up, it will be no great loss."&#xD;
Blowing up was, in the minds of the family at&#xD;
Wyverne, a necessary result of all chemical&#xD;
investigation.&#xD;
It was more than two days, however, be-&#xD;
fore the necessary repairs to the summer-&#xD;
house were finished, or before Jackson was&#xD;
allowed to return to the neglected plantation.&#xD;
work over which Mr. Wyverne chafed. Ralph&#xD;
might have chafed himself, if it had been any&#xD;
thing but his own crotchet which delayed the&#xD;
completion of cedain desirable and more im-&#xD;
portant buildings; but just now the chemist&#xD;
had a decided advantage over the planter,&#xD;
and he could think of nothing but his ex-&#xD;
periments. There was, of course, more to be&#xD;
done to the pavilion than he had imagined;&#xD;
and, since he had what Jackson called "his&#xD;
own notion" about every thing, a zealous&#xD;
superintendency was necessary, for, like most&#xD;
people, he had learned to his cost that his&#xD;
own notion was very apt to be disregarded&#xD;
unless he was present to enforce it. It fol-&#xD;
&#xD;
lowed that he saw very little of anybody bui&#xD;
the carpenters during these days. Not thai&#xD;
this fact mattered very much. The different&#xD;
members of the household went their accus&#xD;
tomed ways, and Martindale-who came noii&#xD;
and then with a cigar to look on and suggest&#xD;
an alteration or improvement-did not sceix&#xD;
to be suffering from the acute boredom whieb&#xD;
his friend anticipated for him. In truth,&#xD;
Ralph had made an appeal to Nina that some-&#xD;
what averted this terrible malady from its&#xD;
threatened subject.&#xD;
"Do be a good girl and entertain Martin.&#xD;
dale while I am about this work," he said.&#xD;
"I shall really take it as a personal favor if&#xD;
you will. What is to become of the poor&#xD;
fellow I don't know, he is so little used to&#xD;
such a vegetating life as the one we lead."&#xD;
"I will do my best for Mr. Martindale's&#xD;
entertainment, since you desire it," Nina an.&#xD;
swerved, with a reluctance upon which it would&#xD;
have been difficult for any one-perhaps even&#xD;
for herself-to decide whether or not it was&#xD;
genuine. "But I don't like him, and I really&#xD;
wonder it never occurred to you that other&#xD;
people besides Mr. Martindale might findour&#xD;
life a vegetation."&#xD;
"Ralph says that I am to entertain you&#xD;
and keep you from being bored to death,"&#xD;
she said to Martindale, an hour or two later.&#xD;
"I wish you would tell me how to do it. I&#xD;
never had a traveled fine gentleman on my&#xD;
hands before, and the novelty threatens to be&#xD;
overwhelming."&#xD;
"It you consider me a traveled fine gen-&#xD;
tleman," answered Martindaic, "it proves&#xD;
conclusively that you have never known a&#xD;
Simon-pure of that species. lam the farthest&#xD;
in the world from deserving such a reproach,&#xD;
or such a distinction-as you choose to con-&#xD;
sider it-and I am the most easily.entertained&#xD;
person in the world, besides. But if I were&#xD;
if ~ geant as possible, it would be strange&#xD;
could not loiter away a few days at this&#xD;
delightful old place, without incurring the&#xD;
penalty of ennui. I feel like a traveler who&#xD;
has found an enchanted castle and an en.&#xD;
chanted princess," he added, smiling.&#xD;
"Do you?" said Nina-and she smiled&#xD;
also. It was not disagreeable to be lik-&#xD;
ened to an enchanted princess, and a thrill&#xD;
of that pleasurable excitement which she&#xD;
had felt when they were riding together&#xD;
through the summer woods came over her.&#xD;
At such moments, the instinct of distrust&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
which she felt against Martindale-it never&#xD;
amounted to dislike, though it sometimes&#xD;
amounted to repulsion-lost its force. She&#xD;
saw only a handsome man, full of theje ne&#xD;
80i8 quoi of society, who looked at her with&#xD;
admiration, and spoke to her with compel.&#xD;
monte-a man who seemed to bring into her.&#xD;
life a breath of that world for which all her&#xD;
eager fancy, all her overflowing, sensuous vi.&#xD;
* tality longed.&#xD;
"But the knights who found enchanted&#xD;
castles usually had rather a hard time of it,&#xD;
* had they not?" she said. "I am afraid you&#xD;
have chosen your comparison unfortunately-&#xD;
which is too bad, when you meant to be com-&#xD;
plimentary."&#xD;
"They found the princess, however," he&#xD;
said," and that made amends for all else.&#xD;
Dragons, giants, lions, tyrants - all were&#xD;
child's play when compared with that re-&#xD;
ward."&#xD;
"Princesses must have been worth a&#xD;
good deal in those days," said Nina, de-&#xD;
murely.&#xD;
"Not more than in these," answered Mar-&#xD;
tindale, readily. "The trouble now, as then,&#xD;
only is-to find them."&#xD;
"One might say the same of dragons and&#xD;
unicorns," responded Miss Daizell.&#xD;
"Dragons and unicorns were mythical;&#xD;
princesses were not," said Martindale, grave-&#xD;
ly. "They exist now, as they existed then-&#xD;
and one finds them sometimes. If I were&#xD;
fortunate enough to do so," he went on, "I&#xD;
should tell the fair captive that, according to&#xD;
all rules of romance and chivalry, the dis-&#xD;
coverer should also be the deliverer."&#xD;
"Allow me to remind you of Mrs. Glass's&#xD;
immortal recipe for dressing a hare," said Ni-&#xD;
na. "First find your princess, then decide&#xD;
what you will say to her. Not but that itjs&#xD;
easy enough to predicate beforehand what&#xD;
that would be," she ended, with a cool shrug&#xD;
of the shoulders.&#xD;
"Is it?" said he, smiling'.. "Tell me,.&#xD;
then, what it would be? I see you are well&#xD;
acquainted with the ways of knights and&#xD;
princesses."&#xD;
"Knights are very much like m&amp;amp;i nowa~&#xD;
days, I fancy," she answered. "They paid a.&#xD;
great many pretty compliments to the prih.&#xD;
cesses, who, despite the fact of their exalted&#xD;
rank, resembled other foolish country maidens,&#xD;
and, perhaps, were silly enough to believe&#xD;
them. Then, when the charm of novelty wan&#xD;

&#xD;
gone from these fair ladies, no more pretty&#xD;
speeches came, the knights, as a rule, found&#xD;
the enchanted castles very dull,' ordered their&#xD;
horses and rode away, to repeat the amuse-&#xD;
ment, 'with variations,' as they do in music,&#xD;
at the next ckdfeau."&#xD;
"But you forget that seine women never&#xD;
lose the charm of novelty," said he. "Some&#xD;
of them are like the chameleon, and change&#xD;
while a man gazes. You remember how it&#xD;
was written of one woman that 'age could&#xD;
not wither nor custom stale her infinite va-&#xD;
riety.'"&#xD;
"There was never but one 'serpent of&#xD;
old Nile,' however," said Nina, shaking her&#xD;
head.&#xD;
On the whole, it was not remarkable that&#xD;
Mr. Martindale bore with edifying philosophy&#xD;
the delay about the laboratory. It was cer-&#xD;
tainly more agreeable to loiter with Nina in&#xD;
the drawing-room or garden through the&#xD;
long, golden hours of a June day, than to&#xD;
spend the same hours in abstruse calculations&#xD;
and doubtful experiments, bending over chem-&#xD;
ical apparatus and chemical books. Ralph&#xD;
might have spared his anxiety about his&#xD;
friend, if he had only known how very well&#xD;
that gentleman was entertainedd."&#xD;
Meanwhile Nina, unconsciously to herself;&#xD;
began to experience something of that subtle&#xD;
intoxication which the fumes of flattery soon&#xD;
produce on all save the steadiest brain. This&#xD;
was not remarkable, since circumstances&#xD;
daily threw her into closer intercourse with&#xD;
Martindale, and the repulsion which she had&#xD;
at first felt for him gradually changed into an&#xD;
attraction in which gratified vanity played no&#xD;
inconsiderable part. Besides vanity, how-&#xD;
ever, there was also the freshness of novelty,&#xD;
the glow of excitement, and that thrill of&#xD;
conscious power which, to many women,&#xD;
makes the chief fascination of that danger-&#xD;
ous pastime which the world has agreed to&#xD;
call flirtation. It was unfortunate that there&#xD;
was no one to utter a warning, or extend are-&#xD;
~traint over the girl. Ralph was busy with&#xD;
his pavilion, and thought much more of his&#xD;
chemical researches than of his betrothed.&#xD;
Mrs. Wyverne was essentially a house-keeping&#xD;
nonentity; Mr. Wyverne never regarded the&#xD;
matter at all. So, Nina went her own way,&#xD;
and rode, or walked, or talked with the hand-&#xD;
some stranger without a word of rebuke, or&#xD;
an attempt at interference. It was after one&#xD;
of these rides-which had been extended far&#xD;
&#xD;
into the lovely June woods, under the twilight&#xD;
June stars-that, having come home and laid&#xD;
aside her habit, she stood before her mirror&#xD;
looking with critical intentness at the exqui-&#xD;
site face, illumined with light and vivid with&#xD;
color, which gazed back at her out of the&#xD;
shadowy depths of the glass. As she re-&#xD;
garded it, a bright smile, half of triumph,&#xD;
half of defiance, curled her scarlet lip.&#xD;
"How pretty I am! "die said "It is no&#xD;
wonder that he thinks it pleasant to amuse&#xD;
himself with me. But will he think it pleas-&#xD;
ant if I turn the tables and amuse myself&#xD;
with kim? It is only a game of skill on both&#xD;
sides, and promises me a little of that zest&#xD;
and spice which my life lacks so horribly-a&#xD;
little taste of that power which is said to be&#xD;
the sweetest draught in the world! Men of&#xD;
this class are not troubled with hearts to lose&#xD;
or break, and Ralph would not be jealous if&#xD;
I flirted with everybody in the world! What&#xD;
is it Thekla says?-&#xD;
"' I have lived and loved, but that was to-day;&#xD;
Make ready my grave-clothes to-morrow.'&#xD;
Only I don't mean to love, whatever else I&#xD;
may do, and it is not my grave-clothes, but my&#xD;
wedding-dress, which is to be made ready to-&#xD;
morrow"&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
NorwiTnsrxinnNu other and brighter at-&#xD;
tractions, when the pavilion was at last fin-&#xD;
ished and all the chemical apparatus removed&#xD;
thither from the attic laboratory, Martindale&#xD;
betook himself to the experiments with ~n&#xD;
energy which pleased Ralph exceedingly, and&#xD;
astonished? Nina not a little. The latter had&#xD;
so unhesitatingly made up her mind that the&#xD;
young chemist's change of opinion with re-&#xD;
gard to the "idea" of her cousin, was a&#xD;
piece of interested hypocrisy for the better&#xD;
prosecution of a flirtation with herself; that&#xD;
she was not only surprised, but very much&#xD;
piqued, by the prompt desertion of her stand-&#xD;
ard, which took place as soon as the labora-&#xD;
tory was in good working order. What did&#xD;
it mean? she asked, a little indignantly. Had&#xD;
she indeed overrated her consequence so&#xD;
greatly as to fancy that she was the chief at-&#xD;
traction that detained Martindale at Wy-&#xD;
verne, when she was, in truth, only the&#xD;
amusement - the plaything - of his idle&#xD;
hours? It was in answering this question&#xD;
&#xD;
that Nina's natural shrewdness first failed to&#xD;
come to the aid of her inexperience. A duller&#xD;
woman, who knew the world, would have un-&#xD;
derstood Martindale's tactics: this bright,&#xD;
clever girl, witii the disadvantage of not&#xD;
knowing the world, fell into his trap at once.&#xD;
In the first place, she found the days in-&#xD;
tolerably dull and tame, without the flavor of&#xD;
excitement, the incense of flattery which for&#xD;
some time had unceasingly surrounded her; in&#xD;
in the second place, the strong instinct of con-&#xD;
quest, the strong desire to win and wield power,&#xD;
which makes men conquerors, and women&#xD;
coquettes, sprang up like a sudden flame,&#xD;
fanned by the weary monotony, the yearning&#xD;
discontent of her life. Martindale's neglect&#xD;
stung her, not so much because her heart or&#xD;
her fancy were interested in him, as because&#xD;
her vanity missed the homage upon which it&#xD;
had fed, and her life the excitement of that&#xD;
"fair game of skill" upon which she had so&#xD;
willingly entered. Being stung, she turned,&#xD;
like every other creature of which we know,&#xD;
in wrath and resolution. "If he has amused&#xD;
himself, with me, I will do something more&#xD;
than amuse myself with him!" she said. "If&#xD;
he has made a plaything of me, I will make&#xD;
something more than a plaything of him.&#xD;
Can I do it, I wonder? "-and she laughed a&#xD;
little, arching her white neck proudly; "at&#xD;
least it will he worth while to try-to test my&#xD;
power-to learn, once for all, if I was made&#xD;
for this domestic treadmill, or if I could have&#xD;
been something else had Fate been kind&#xD;
enough to give me another life!"&#xD;
Yet, if Nina , had been asked to define&#xD;
what her "something else" implied, it is not&#xD;
probable that she would have found it very&#xD;
easy to do, though an indefinite vision of a&#xD;
life made up of unlimited conquests, of per-&#xD;
petual homage, of the power for which every&#xD;
instinct of her nature yearned, floated before&#xD;
her eyes. Left to herself; it is likely enough&#xD;
that the girl would have dreamed these fan-&#xD;
cies, but the enchanter who had made them&#xD;
to such wild life was Martindale. In word,&#xD;
and look, and tone, ha had said: "You, who&#xD;
are buried here, were born for other things,&#xD;
and have only to enter the world to make a&#xD;
sensation such as few women of your genera-&#xD;
tion are able to achieve!" Nina had langlied&#xD;
and disclaimed the flattery; but while she&#xD;
disclaimed she had believed. Itwould have&#xD;
been strange, indeed, if one so young, so igno-&#xD;
rant, yet so conscious of her own rare beauty,&#xD;
&#xD;
and her own keen wits, had not believed a&#xD;
thing so pleasant to human self-esteem. If in-&#xD;
experience makes us timid, it also makes us pre-&#xD;
sumptuous. It is not until we have measured&#xD;
ourselves with others-hand to hand and foot&#xD;
to foot-in the great arena of the world, that&#xD;
we learn the true proportions of our own&#xD;
statues.&#xD;
Meanwhile Martindale, who spent most of&#xD;
his days and half~f his nights in the labo-&#xD;
ratory, suggested to Ralph that certain new&#xD;
inventions in apparatus, together with certain&#xD;
new scientific books, were imperatively needed.&#xD;
"You are behind the day, my dear fellow,"&#xD;
he said; "every month chronicles an advance&#xD;
in chemistry. It will never do to shut your&#xD;
mind up, and imagine that what you kaae&#xD;
learned is sufficient. In this science, above&#xD;
all sciences, you must keep yourself en rap-&#xD;
po~l with the progress of the hour, if you do&#xD;
not want to 'be left hopelessly behind."&#xD;
Ralph, replying meekly that he was aware of&#xD;
this fact, and that he had endeavored, as far&#xD;
as lay in his power, to keep himself en rap.&#xD;
p.~'t with the progress of the hour, at once&#xD;
made a memorandum of the desired apparatus&#xD;
and necessary books, for which he promised&#xD;
to send an order by that day's mail.&#xD;
Returning to the house for this purpose,&#xD;
he told Nina triumphantly that he had never&#xD;
seen anybody go into any thing with more&#xD;
zest than Martindale had gone into the ex-&#xD;
periments. "What a thing it is to have a&#xD;
scientific turn!" he said. "The fellow abso-&#xD;
lutely bends over his crucibles as' if be were&#xD;
in love with them! And what a thing it is&#xD;
to have a scientific education, too! I feel as&#xD;
if I were the most ignorant dabbler in the&#xD;
world, when I stand and watch him at work."&#xD;
"Chemistry must be very interesting,"&#xD;
said Nina, musingly. A bright thought sud-&#xD;
denly occurrcdto her. She felt more than&#xD;
ordinarily listless that morning, and since the&#xD;
mountain would not come to Mohammed, why~&#xD;
should not Mohammed go to the mountain,&#xD;
even though it kad taken up its' abode in a&#xD;
laboratory 1' "I should like to see some of&#xD;
Mr. Martindale's experiments," she said, care-&#xD;
lessly. "Do you think he would nijud if I&#xD;
went to the laboratory for that purpose?"&#xD;
"I am sure he would be very glad to see&#xD;
you, and explain every thing you wanted t&amp;amp;&#xD;
know," answered honest, unsuspicious Ralph,&#xD;
delighted with this first token of interest in&#xD;
his beloved purs~sit. "If you really e&amp;amp;re' to&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
go, I will take you down as soon as I have fin-&#xD;
ished my letter."&#xD;
But this was not exactly what Nina wanted.&#xD;
"I thought you promised uncle to go to Elk-&#xD;
bridge on business this morning?" she said.&#xD;
"By Jove, so I did 1" answered Ralph.&#xD;
"Thank you for reminding me of it. I'll&#xD;
order my horse in a minute, but, while he is&#xD;
being saddled, I can walk with you to the&#xD;
laboratory, and Martindale can give you a&#xD;
chemical lecture at his leisure. If you would&#xD;
only believe it, Nina, there is not in the world&#xD;
a more fascinating study than that of chem-&#xD;
istry."&#xD;
"I can readily believe it," answered Nina,&#xD;
a little dryly.&#xD;
She left the room as she said this, and&#xD;
went up-stairs. But when Ralph, having fin-&#xD;
ished his letter and ordered his horse, sent a&#xD;
messenger to announce that he was ready to&#xD;
go to the pavilion, she did not keep him wait-&#xD;
ing, as he had feared she would. On the con-&#xD;
trary, her light step on the broad, shallow&#xD;
staircase, made him turn from the hall-door,&#xD;
where he was standing, before he had im-&#xD;
agined that his message would have reached&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Why, Nina, you have changed your&#xD;
dress!" he said, even his unobservant eye&#xD;
being struck by the heightening effect which&#xD;
a cloud of transparent lawn, in tint like a&#xD;
blush-rose, produced on her beauty. "It&#xD;
is amazingly becoming; but I wonder you&#xD;
put on any thing so pretty when you are go-&#xD;
ing down to the laboratory. If some of the&#xD;
chemicals should drop on it__"&#xD;
"tie you make a rule of dropping chem-&#xD;
icals on people's dresses 2" asked Nina, as&#xD;
she drew on her gloves and took her parasol&#xD;
from the hall-table. "Not that it matters&#xD;
very much if you do. However becoming&#xD;
pink muslin may be, it is, fortunately, not ex-&#xD;
pensive. I changed my dress because the&#xD;
other had a fruit-stain on it."&#xD;
This was true. Microscopic observation&#xD;
might have detected a small fruit-stain on the&#xD;
skirt of the dress which had been thrown&#xD;
aside; but Nina did not add, that out of her&#xD;
whole wardrobe she had carefully selected the&#xD;
one she wore as the most becoming, and that&#xD;
when she passed the strings of her garden-hat&#xD;
over the rich masses of her hair, she had felt&#xD;
eminently satisfied with the result of her&#xD;
choice,&#xD;
What Martindale thought when, roused&#xD;
&#xD;
NINA'S ATONEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
out of his study of a chemical manual by the&#xD;
unexpected sound of voices, he turned to see&#xD;
this exquisite vision framed in the open door&#xD;
of the pavilion, with green boughs drooping&#xD;
slantwise behind, and a vista of the garden&#xD;
beyond, it would be hard to say. For a mm-&#xD;
nte he did not utter a word. He only caught&#xD;
his breath quickly-startled out of his usual&#xD;
cool self-possession by the glowing beauty of&#xD;
the face which looked at him. For an in-&#xD;
stant he wondered if he had ever before real-&#xD;
ized Nina's exceeding loveliness-a loveliness&#xD;
that might have driven an artist to despair,&#xD;
since the tints were never mixed on palette or&#xD;
laid on canvas that could have copied the&#xD;
abounding freshness and glory of her color-&#xD;
ing-the satin softness and rose brilliance&#xD;
of her skin, the cleft scarlet of her lips, the&#xD;
bronze sheen of her hair, or the liquid lustre&#xD;
of her eyes. It was Ralph's voice that re-&#xD;
called his self-possession as the cousins ad-&#xD;
vanced.&#xD;
"I have brought Nina down to see some&#xD;
chemical experiments, Martindale," he said.&#xD;
"I suppose you are not too busy to show her&#xD;
a few things-simple things, you know. I&#xD;
would do it myself, only I am obliged to ride&#xD;
over to Elkbridge this morning.&#xD;
"I shall be very glad to show Miss Dal-&#xD;
zell any thing that will interest her," Martin-&#xD;
dale answered. "But I thought you did not&#xD;
like chemistry," be added, looking at Nina&#xD;
and speaking almost abruptly.&#xD;
"I do not," she answered, carelessly, con-&#xD;
scious of feeling a little provoked by his tone.&#xD;
"I am only idle this morning, and idleness&#xD;
begets curiosity-even in things which do&#xD;
not usually interest one. I should be sorry&#xD;
to disturb your industry, however, Mr. Mar-&#xD;
tindale. Your studies seem so very abstruse"&#xD;
-her half-mocking gaze swept over the open&#xD;
pages of the book he had laid down-4' that&#xD;
it would be a pity to interrupt them. Ralph&#xD;
can spare a little time for my instruction, can-&#xD;
not you, Ralph? No doubt my curiosity will&#xD;
be satisfied with a very small amount of learn-&#xD;
ing. By way of beginning, what is this?"&#xD;
and, extending her hand, she touched with&#xD;
one finger part of the apparatus on ~ table&#xD;
near by.&#xD;
"That is a glass retort," answered Ralph,&#xD;
delighted to play school-master. "This gas-&#xD;
lamp is what we call a Bunsen's burner; and&#xD;
if you will observe, Nina, you will see that&#xD;
the action of heat is evolving a gas from the&#xD;
&#xD;
chemical substances in the retort which the&#xD;
receiver here is placed to collect, and-"&#xD;
"Yes, I see all about it," said Nina; "but&#xD;
suppose I take the stopper from the retort,&#xD;
will any thing occur?"&#xD;
"You must not think of such a thing,"&#xD;
said Martindale, coming forward, and, to her&#xD;
surprise, quickly removing her hand from the&#xD;
stopper, on which it rested. "The gas which&#xD;
is being evolved here is the most subtle and&#xD;
dangerous known to chemistry. You had bet-&#xD;
ter come away, Miss DaIzell. I will show you&#xD;
some of the ordinary experiments "&#xD;
"But I don't want to see any ordinary ex-&#xD;
periments)" said Nina, the perverse. "I want&#xD;
to hear about this subtle and dangerous gas.&#xD;
What is the name of it? Ralph, I did not&#xD;
know that you were in the habit of experi-&#xD;
menting with such things."&#xD;
"This is x~ot one of my experiments," said&#xD;
Ralph. "Martindale is after a craze of his&#xD;
own, and has been experimenting in the cyan-&#xD;
ogen compounds for some time.-It is hydro-&#xD;
cyanic acid you are preparing now, is it not?"&#xD;
he added, looking at his friend.&#xD;
"Exactly that," answered Martindale, "so&#xD;
you see you must bring Miss Dalzell away.-&#xD;
You have no idea how dangerous this is," he&#xD;
went on, turning to Nina. "One drop of the&#xD;
pure substance is sufficient to kill, and a&#xD;
chemist has always to be very careful in pre-&#xD;
paring it, since the vapor, even in small quan-&#xD;
tities, will produce fatal results."&#xD;
"How terrible!" said Nina, and, looking&#xD;
at him, her rose-leaf color faded a little.&#xD;
"You should not tamper with such dreadful&#xD;
things," she said. "What if you killed your-&#xD;
self?"&#xD;
"It would not matter very much if I did,"&#xD;
he answered, carelessly. "My life is not of'&#xD;
much importance-not like Ralph's there, for&#xD;
instance. You may be sure I don't involve&#xD;
Aim in any of my dangerous experiments."&#xD;
"Very considerate of him, isn't it?" said&#xD;
Ralph, laughing. "But you may rest satisfied&#xD;
that he knows what he is about, and is not&#xD;
likely to poison himself. Now I must really&#xD;
go, for I am sure my horse is waiting. Mar-&#xD;
tindale, it would be a very pretty experiment&#xD;
to show her about water, you know-how ox-&#xD;
ygen and hydrogen make it, and all that sort&#xD;
of thing.-You've no idea how interesting it&#xD;
is, Nina, to see gas turned into water before&#xD;
your eyes."&#xD;
Although Nina made no reply, he left the 1&#xD;
&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
pavilion quite light-hearted. It was so cheer-&#xD;
ing to think that she was really beginning to&#xD;
take an interest in chemistry at last! It&#xD;
would be so pleasant, he thought-for Ralph&#xD;
was domestic even in his love of science-to&#xD;
possess a wife who would share his entfiusi-&#xD;
asm to the extent of a gentle feminine sym-&#xD;
pathy, who would take an interest in his cx-&#xD;
perlinents, and understand intelligently what&#xD;
he was doing, or what he wished to do! It&#xD;
was true that common-sense, liberally aided&#xD;
by experience, might have assured him how&#xD;
little Nina was likely to be metamorphosed&#xD;
into such a wife; but men like Wyverne have&#xD;
an abounding faith in the power of matri-&#xD;
mony to work any and every change in the&#xD;
habits, tastes, and disposition of a woman.&#xD;
As he mounted his horse and rode away in&#xD;
the golden sunlight, it did not occur to him&#xD;
that he had left behind, and in close proximi-&#xD;
ty, materials more inflammable than any of&#xD;
his gases; that the passion of a man, and the&#xD;
fancy of a woman, may sometimes form a&#xD;
combination more dangerous than any chemi-&#xD;
cal result. It is difficult to say whether it&#xD;
was well or ill for him that he realized noth-&#xD;
ing of this. If Nina had been as old as his&#xD;
mother, and as ugly as Hecate, he could not&#xD;
have felt less uneasiness concerning her. If&#xD;
Martindale had been Sir Galahad in person,&#xD;
he could not have trusted him more implicitly.&#xD;
It is a bitter lesson, though a necessary one,&#xD;
when the world first teaches us that such&#xD;
trust is rarely, if ever, wisely given-but it&#xD;
was a lesson of which Ralph Wyverne had&#xD;
not yet learned the initial letter.&#xD;
In the pavilion, after he left it, silence&#xD;
reigned for a minute. For the first time in&#xD;
her life a sudden, strange shyness came over&#xD;
Nina; for the first time, also, she felt a dis-&#xD;
trust of herself and of her usually ready&#xD;
tongue, which half inclined her to wish her-&#xD;
self away. Martindale's manner of meeting&#xD;
her had been so different from any thing&#xD;
which she anticipated that it had discom-&#xD;
posed and thrown her back on herself in a&#xD;
most provoking manner. She had expected&#xD;
that he would be radiant with pleasure, and&#xD;
full of the ease and brightness which she&#xD;
liked; on the contrary, he was stiff, reserved,&#xD;
and almost rude. True, ~he was conscious&#xD;
that be regarded her with an admiration more&#xD;
eloquent than many words; but, feeling the&#xD;
blood deepening in her fair cheeks under his&#xD;
gaze, she chose to consider even this a fresh&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
cause of offense, and so turned away petulant-&#xD;
ly toward the door.&#xD;
"Since Ralph has gone, I will not detain&#xD;
you any longer," she said. "Of course, you&#xD;
must be anxious to return to your, b~oks and&#xD;
gases."&#xD;
She looked so mutine and lovely in hei~&#xD;
vexation, that Martindale could with diffi-&#xD;
culty repress a smile. He understood so well&#xD;
why she had come, and the disappointment in&#xD;
which she was going, that he felt tempted to&#xD;
amuse himself by adding a little more fuel to&#xD;
the flame of her petulance before he indemni-&#xD;
fied himself; in his own fashion, for the self-&#xD;
denial of the last few days. Even to look at&#xD;
her was such a pjeasure, to a man who wor-&#xD;
shiped beauty as this student of chemistry&#xD;
did, that he wanted to make the most of her&#xD;
changing moods; to watch the sea-shell color&#xD;
vary, to note every play of the flexible lips,&#xD;
and to meet the full-orbed glow of the eyes&#xD;
before he won her back-as he knew a word&#xD;
would win her back-to her usual sparkling&#xD;
self.&#xD;
"You cannot surely think that you detain&#xD;
me I" he repeated, in answer to her last&#xD;
words. "I must beg you to believe that I&#xD;
am highly honored by your visit. My studies&#xD;
and experiments can readily wait your pleas-&#xD;
ure."&#xD;
"It is not at all necessary that they should&#xD;
do so," said Nina, vexed afresh, as he knew&#xD;
that she would be, by the formality of his&#xD;
words. "My pleasure is to find something&#xD;
more entertaining than chemistry. I told&#xD;
Ralph that a very small amount of'knowledge&#xD;
would gratify my curiosity. It has been quite&#xD;
gratified."&#xD;
"But you have not gained any knowledge&#xD;
at all," said he, laughing. Tben he came for-&#xD;
ward to her side. "If you go, you must let&#xD;
me go with you," he said. "Since I have&#xD;
been demoralized by a glimpse of your face, I&#xD;
cannot return to the books and gases to which&#xD;
you so kindly commend me."&#xD;
The face of which he spoke frowned,&#xD;
blushed, and smiled, all at once-the peach.&#xD;
blossom tints glowing into brighter beauty&#xD;
under his glance. But, for all that, Nina was&#xD;
not appeased, as her answer showed:&#xD;
"I am sorry that my face should have de-&#xD;
moralized you," she said, stiffly. "I can only&#xD;
make amends by removing it at once. Per-&#xD;
haps, indeed, I ought to apologize for intrud-&#xD;
ing at all into such sacred precincts; but I&#xD;
&#xD;
came to gratify Ralph. He thinks that, be-&#xD;
fore we are married, I ought to learn a little&#xD;
chemistry."&#xD;
"Is that a necessary preparation for mat-&#xD;
rimony?" asked Martindale. His manner&#xD;
did not betray the jealous pang at his heart,&#xD;
but he could not help wondering if she at all&#xD;
estimated the power of her last words to&#xD;
change his amused trifling into a sudden res-&#xD;
olute determination to use to the full this op-&#xD;
portunity which fate and caprice had given&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Ralph thinks so," she answered, care-&#xD;
lessly. "He ought to be the best judge,&#xD;
ought not he?"&#xD;
"Of what he desires-certainly. But to&#xD;
desire and to obtain are very different things&#xD;
in this highly-satisfactory life of ours."&#xD;
"Not with him," she said. "He has had&#xD;
every thing that he ever desired-even me,"&#xD;
she added, shrugging her shoulders-" if I&#xD;
am worth counting a possession."&#xD;
"Do you doubt your value?" said her&#xD;
companion, with a slight laugh. "If you de-&#xD;
sire to test it, take your life back into your&#xD;
own hands, and see whether even Ralph's im-&#xD;
passive calm will not be stirred."&#xD;
"If I took it back, what should I do with&#xD;
it?" she asked. There was an accent of the&#xD;
pathos that is born of hopelessness in her&#xD;
voice, which was not meant for effect. She&#xD;
had asked herself the same question before&#xD;
this, and knew how dreary the answer was.&#xD;
"Shall I tell you?" said he, quickly, with&#xD;
a cadence of passionate meaning in his tone.&#xD;
He would test his power, and know the beet&#xD;
or worst at once, he thought..&#xD;
But Nina drew herself up proudly.&#xD;
"Why should you tell me?" she asked.&#xD;
"There is no possibility of such an event&#xD;
coming to pass." Then, with an eagerness&#xD;
that told its own story of ~elf-reproach, she&#xD;
added: "It is a good thing to he able to&#xD;
trust one's life into such faithful keeping as&#xD;
that of Ralph. I do not think there is a&#xD;
kinder or truer heart than his in the world."&#xD;
"Ralph is a very good fellow," said Mar-&#xD;
tindale, quietly, "but, if he were the best in&#xD;
the universe, he could never make you hap-&#xD;
py."&#xD;
"How can you possibly kuow what would&#xD;
make inc happy?" she demanded, haughtily,&#xD;
her color deepening, her eyes expanding with&#xD;
the glow that he liked to provoke.&#xD;
"Rather, how can I help knowing?" he&#xD;
&#xD;
said, with a smile, as his brown eyes met her&#xD;
own. "Do you remember how you came into&#xD;
the drawing-room that first day?" he went&#xD;
on. "It was like a sudden delicious burst of&#xD;
color, or gleam of sunlight, over a gray land-&#xD;
scape. Even then-even before you had ut-&#xD;
tered a word of the discontent which you felt&#xD;
for your life-I saw how little you belonged&#xD;
to it, how entirely Nature had fitted you for&#xD;
other things. Ralph had told me that you&#xD;
were engaged to him. Instinct told me, as&#xD;
soon as I looked at your face, that this en-&#xD;
gagement owed its existence to your own&#xD;
supreme ignorance of yourself."&#xD;
"And you have been kind enough to en-&#xD;
deavor to enlighten that ignorance!" said&#xD;
she, with not a little bitterness. "I owe you&#xD;
no thanks for it. You have fed my vanity,&#xD;
and fanned the discontent of which I was&#xD;
scarcely conscious before you came, until it&#xD;
renders my life miserable. And you have&#xD;
done this-do not fancy that I am ignorant&#xD;
of it-simply for your own amusement."&#xD;
"Do you think so?" he said; and a sud-&#xD;
den thrill in his voice made her start. "If I&#xD;
have rendered you miserable," he said, draw-&#xD;
ing nearer, and speaking eagerly, "it has&#xD;
been that I might in turn render you happy,&#xD;
that I might rescue you from the death-in-&#xD;
life to which you are doomed, that I might&#xD;
give you to the world for which you were&#xD;
born! Nina, it is useless for me to say that&#xD;
I love you-you know that already-it only&#xD;
remains for you to say'whether you will tame-&#xD;
ly accept the life which has been made for&#xD;
you, or whether you will make your own life&#xD;
by coming with me. I have not wealth to&#xD;
offer you, as Wyverne has, but I have some-&#xD;
thing which is better still-freedom!"&#xD;
He uttered the last word in a tone which&#xD;
was in itself like an electric charge to the girl&#xD;
who listened. Her whole nature seemed to&#xD;
leap up in response. Freedom !-freedom to&#xD;
quaff to its full the elixir of life, of power, of&#xD;
excitement like that which filled her now!&#xD;
The wealth of an emperor would have tempted&#xD;
her less than that single word, than a single&#xD;
one of the hopes it embodied! Yet it was at&#xD;
this moment that a dim, struggling sense of&#xD;
right and wrong came to the girl. Face to&#xD;
face with the roused earnestness of the man&#xD;
before her, all her bright, graceful mockery,&#xD;
her pretty, innate coquetry seemed stricken&#xD;
from her command. Nothing remained but&#xD;
the instinctive resistance of one who feels&#xD;
&#xD;
what is right, and who is tempted within as&#xD;
well as without toward what is wrong.&#xD;
"You must not talk to me like this!"&#xD;
she said, all the bright color ebbing from her&#xD;
face, her breath coming short and quick. "It&#xD;
is unkind-it is dishonorable! You have no&#xD;
right-"&#xD;
"No right!" interrupted he, scornfully.&#xD;
"Who asks for a right? Mine rests in my&#xD;
love for yQu, and my determination to rescue&#xD;
you! I ask no other. Do you think it mat.&#xD;
ters to me that you have promised Ralph&#xD;
Wyverne to marry him? I would walk over&#xD;
a thousand Ralph Wyvernes if it were a ques-&#xD;
tion of' winning you at last."&#xD;
"But it is not a question of that!" said&#xD;
Nina, his imperious tone rousing a flash of de.&#xD;
fiance in her. She realized now how unwise&#xD;
she had been to come, but even if Martindale&#xD;
would have permitted her to leave him-which&#xD;
she felt to be doubtful, since he stood direct-&#xD;
ly in her path-there was a fascination that&#xD;
kept her motionless. Go! How could she&#xD;
go? How could she leave this stir of combat,&#xD;
in which, if there was danger, there was also&#xD;
the quick breath of excitement, for the dull&#xD;
house which she knew so well, and her aunt's&#xD;
platitudes and crochet-work?&#xD;
"You are right," said Martindale, quietly.&#xD;
"It is not a question, but a certainty-for 1&#xD;
will win you, Nina! I have sworn to do it,&#xD;
and there is no power on earth or in heaven&#xD;
to make me swerve from my resolution!"&#xD;
"You cannot win me despite myself," said&#xD;
Nine, who rather liked the novelty of this&#xD;
masterful wooing. She looked up and met&#xD;
the eager, passionate eyes that were bent on&#xD;
her. The first taste of forbidden fruit was&#xD;
sweet to Eve, and alas! it has remained sweet&#xD;
to all of her descendants.&#xD;
"I will win you even despite yourself! "he&#xD;
answered, in a tone of confident power. "But&#xD;
will it need to be despite yourself?" he add-&#xD;
ed, in a softer voice. "Nina, I know you do&#xD;
not love Ralph Wyverne; but can you not&#xD;
love me?"&#xD;
There was little humility in the question,&#xD;
but there can be no doubt that humility would&#xD;
not have served his cause with Nina half so&#xD;
well as the pride that was almost haughty in&#xD;
its self-confidence. He saw the lovely eolor&#xD;
flicker into her face at his last words, the&#xD;
white throat give a quick, nervous gasp, and&#xD;
the lids droop over the eyes. Never had she&#xD;
looked more beautiful, and never had he felt&#xD;

&#xD;
more resolved to win her at all hazards-&#xD;
Even, as he had said, despite herself. Her re-&#xD;
sistance gave a charm, without which her&#xD;
very L'eauty wonid have lost half its value in&#xD;
his eyes.&#xD;
"Can you not love me, and trust your life&#xD;
with me, Nina?" he said, taking into hi~ own&#xD;
the hands which were idly clasped before her,&#xD;
and watching every flutter of the long, curling&#xD;
lashes on the rose-tinted cheek. "I can give&#xD;
you the things for which you long, and love,&#xD;
besides, such as no other man ever will give&#xD;
you. Nina, my beautiful darling, will you not&#xD;
come to me?"&#xD;
"How can you ask such a question?"&#xD;
said Nina, almost in a whisper - somehow&#xD;
her powers of resistance seemed ebbing from&#xD;
her she was conscious of being borne down&#xD;
in the strife which she had so deliberately&#xD;
sought, so arrogantly met-" iou have forgot-&#xD;
ten Ralph, Icannot do so."&#xD;
"Nay," he said, with a slight laugh of&#xD;
triumph, "if you will let mc be your teacher,&#xD;
you will soon learn to forget Ralph. Nina,&#xD;
can you not forget him now? Look at me,&#xD;
sweet one, and let me read the answer in your&#xD;
eyes.?'&#xD;
Even when Nina lifted her eyes, she meant&#xD;
to say, "You are wrong I I can never forget&#xD;
that my honor is bound to Ralph," but some-&#xD;
thing in the glance she met, hushed the words.&#xD;
Every thing suddenly seemed to waver before&#xD;
her-the green, swaying boughs, the golden,&#xD;
summer day, the handsome, bending Thee. It&#xD;
was only when she felt the touch of Martin-&#xD;
dale's lips on her own, that she realized with&#xD;
a sudden shock all that she had implied by&#xD;
her silence.&#xD;
-4-&#xD;
CHAPTER lY.&#xD;
"NINA," said Ralph, tenderly, "I am afraid&#xD;
there is something the matter with you, dear."&#xD;
It was several days after the scene in the&#xD;
laboratory. The cousins were alone in the&#xD;
drawing-room, which Ralph had entered un-&#xD;
expectedly in search of a missing glove, and&#xD;
where he had found Nina all alone, standing&#xD;
by an open window, gazing out absently over&#xD;
the flowery terrace 'to the green lawn beyond.&#xD;
Something listless as well as absent in the&#xD;
girl's attitude struck him suddenly. It was&#xD;
strange for Nina-in whom buoyant youth&#xD;
and health seemed usually overflowing-to&#xD;
appear listless, and he remembered that he&#xD;
&#xD;
had thought her looking pale the day before.&#xD;
Moved by a quick impulse of affectionate con-&#xD;
cern, he crossed the room, therefore, with the&#xD;
caressing wc~da recorded above.&#xD;
But he was not prepared for the startled&#xD;
look in the eyes which turned on him, nor the&#xD;
recoiling movement which she made when be&#xD;
attempted to pass his arm lightly around her.&#xD;
"Nina!" he said, surprised and pained;&#xD;
"is any thing the matter? Have I done any&#xD;
thing to offend you?"&#xD;
"You 1" said Nina, with a faint laugh.&#xD;
"When did you ever do any thing to offend&#xD;
me? I-I am only nervous. I have felt&#xD;
heavy and languid for a day or two. Perhaps&#xD;
I need a tonic. Don't people always need a&#xD;
tonic when they feel languid? Count my&#xD;
pulse, and see if it is all right."&#xD;
She extended her delicate wrist, with a&#xD;
pretty tracery of azure veins showing through&#xD;
the transparent skin; but, instead of accept-&#xD;
ing the diversion thus offered, Ralph placed&#xD;
one hand under her chin, and turned the&#xD;
exquisite Hebe-face toward the light.&#xD;
can judge better from your eyes than&#xD;
from your pulse," he said, gravely. "Look&#xD;
at me, and let me see what cloud has come&#xD;
over you."&#xD;
But this Nina would not do; indeed, she&#xD;
felt that she could not meet the frank, tender&#xD;
eyes looking at her, with the gloom of unquiet&#xD;
deception in her own. The white, sculpto-&#xD;
resque lids fell heavily; the slender, dark&#xD;
brows met in an impatient frown.&#xD;
"Don't, Ralph!" she said, petulantly. "I&#xD;
cannot endure such a glare! There is noth-&#xD;
ing the matter with me, except that I am&#xD;
stupid and dull."&#xD;
"Why, you were nervous and languid a&#xD;
minute ago," said Ralph, "and now stupid&#xD;
and dull-what a sudden list of maladies!&#xD;
And, for you, of all people! Do you know-.&#xD;
now that I come to think of it-you have not&#xD;
seemed quite yourself since that day we went&#xD;
down to the laboratory? I wonder if you&#xD;
could have inhaled some of Martindale's poi-&#xD;
sonous compounds?"&#xD;
"How absurd!" said Nina; but her smile&#xD;
was forced, and the vivid color which leaped&#xD;
to her face might have wakened suspicion in&#xD;
anybody but Ralph. He, however, blundered&#xD;
on:&#xD;
"I must make Martindale come and pre-&#xD;
scribe for you," said Ralph. "Every chemist&#xD;
is something of a physician-at jeast to the&#xD;
&#xD;
extent of knowing the effect of his chemicals.&#xD;
If you should have chanced to inhale a little&#xD;
poison, he must administer an antidote as&#xD;
soon as possible.~~&#xD;
"Pray, don't be foolish!" said Nina, cold-&#xD;
ly-the flush on her face had faded as quick-&#xD;
ly as it came, and nothing remained now but&#xD;
a faint stain of color 'on either cheek-" I&#xD;
have inhaled no poison; but, if I had done&#xD;
so, I would not care to receive an antidote&#xD;
from Mr. Martindale. Ralph," she said, sud-&#xD;
denly and passionately, "I asked you to send&#xD;
that man away when he first came here. It&#xD;
would have been better-oh, how much better&#xD;
-if you had heeded me!"&#xD;
"Has Martindale been doing any thing?"&#xD;
said Ralph. "1 knew somebody had offended&#xD;
you, Nina; but 1 am sorry that you have gone&#xD;
back to your dislike of him."&#xD;
"I did not say that I had gone back to&#xD;
my dislike of him," answered Nina, impatient-&#xD;
ly. "Ralph,. can you not understand that&#xD;
one can distrust a person without-without&#xD;
disliking him?"&#xD;
"No, Icannot understand it," said Ralph,&#xD;
frankly. "With me, to like and to trust arc&#xD;
synonymous terms. I could nQt for a mo-&#xD;
ment entertain any regard for a person whom&#xD;
I distrusted."&#xD;
"That is to say, you could not leara to&#xD;
regard a person whom you distrusted," said&#xD;
Nina, quickly. "But if you liked - loved,&#xD;
perhaps-already, could you not continue to&#xD;
like or love even if-if you had cause to dis-&#xD;
trust?~~&#xD;
"I scarcely think so,?' he answered, sim-&#xD;
ply. "But, thank God, I have never been&#xD;
tried with a distrust of any one whom I&#xD;
loved!"&#xD;
"I wonder how you would bear it," said&#xD;
she, half absently-gazing away from him out&#xD;
of the window.&#xD;
"Badly enough," he answered. "In fact,&#xD;
I cannot imagine how I would bear it at all.&#xD;
Nothing could be more horrible-more unen-&#xD;
durable!" Then, quickly: "Don't let us talk&#xD;
of such things-they are not for you and me.&#xD;
We trust each other, do we not?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered she, quietly-if he had&#xD;
noticed closely, he would have seen a quick&#xD;
gasp in her throat-" but neither of us&#xD;
can tell how unworthy the other may be of&#xD;
that trust."&#xD;
"Good Heavens, Nina!" said Ralph. He&#xD;
was quite confounded by this unexpected re-&#xD;
&#xD;
ply, and for a minute could only stare at the&#xD;
speaker. Then, naturally enough, it occurred&#xD;
to him that such a surprising supposition&#xD;
must refer to himself. "Something certainly&#xD;
is the matter," he said, emphatically, "Nina;&#xD;
will you not tell mc what it is? if 1 have&#xD;
done any thing to pain or anlioy you-"&#xD;
"You done any thing!" interrupted Nina,&#xD;
again. "Ralph, are you mad? You never&#xD;
did any thing in your life to pain or annoy&#xD;
me. it is I who have always pained and an-&#xD;
noyed you, who have been cold and ungrate-&#xD;
ful, and-and unworthy of every kind and&#xD;
loving thought that you have ever given mel&#xD;
If you could forget me," said she, meeting his'&#xD;
gaze suddenly for the first time, "it might be&#xD;
the best thing that could befall you."&#xD;
"Nina, you certainly must be ill!" said&#xD;
Ralph. "You would never talk such non-&#xD;
sense if you were not, Why, I never heard&#xD;
any thing like it! Forget you !-I, who have&#xD;
never done any thing but love you since you&#xD;
first came to us! Here I-let me feel your&#xD;
pulse. You certainly must have a fever."&#xD;
But, instead of extending her wrist again,&#xD;
Nina laid her hand on his shoulder, and looked&#xD;
at him with a steady, wistful air. As she&#xD;
faced him thus, he began to observe, for the&#xD;
first time, the deep shadow in her usually&#xD;
sunny face.&#xD;
"Ralph," she said, slowly, "do you not&#xD;
see that I shall never be able to make you&#xD;
happy? Dear, we are too unlike. One can&#xD;
do a great deal toward controlling one's self&#xD;
-at least good people say that we can-but&#xD;
one cannot create one's self over again on an-&#xD;
other model, and that is what I should have&#xD;
to do before I should be able to live your life&#xD;
as your wife should live it."&#xD;
"What on earth has put such ideas into&#xD;
your head?" asked Ralph, alarmed and puz-&#xD;
zled both at once. "If I am willing to take&#xD;
you just as you are, without any creating&#xD;
over again whatever, why should you torment&#xD;
yourself with scruples and ideas like these?&#xD;
When you are married and settled, you will&#xD;
grow to like domestic things better than you&#xD;
do now-but I only desire that change for&#xD;
your own comfort. I love you too well as&#xD;
you are, to see any fault in you."&#xD;
Nina dropped her hand wearily, and turned&#xD;
from him again toward the window. "If you&#xD;
knew me as I am, you would not love me for&#xD;
an hour," she said. "0 Ralph, if you would&#xD;
only give me up, and-and let me sink out&#xD;
&#xD;

22                          NINA'S AT&#xD;
of your lice, you would be so much happi-&#xD;
er!"&#xD;
"Nina!" said Ralph, and his voice had a&#xD;
cadence in it which made her start, thinking&#xD;
she had betrayed herself. instinctively she&#xD;
dyew into the shade, as he bent forward that&#xD;
he might read her face by the full light of the&#xD;
window. "Am I so dull that II have not&#xD;
understood you all this time I" he said, with&#xD;
a strange sort of tension in his tone. "Is it&#xD;
for yourself you have been pleading, while you&#xD;
talked of me? You say that I will find no&#xD;
happiness in our marriage..-Nina, are you&#xD;
thinking what you will find ?"&#xD;
She looked up at him half piteously, the&#xD;
fingers of her right hand seeking the engage-&#xD;
went-ring which her left hand wore. Now&#xD;
was the golden moment in which to speak, if&#xD;
~he meant to speak at all; but face to face&#xD;
with the opportunity, she shrank back, feel-&#xD;
ing her inability to use it. For Nina was&#xD;
not only a born epicurean-a born seeker&#xD;
and lover of pleasure and delight-but she&#xD;
was also that which all epicureans essentially&#xD;
are-a coward. She shrank from any thing&#xD;
painful, as she might have shrunk from a&#xD;
cruel blow. Looking into Ralph's face-&#xD;
it had grown very pale, and, although the eyes&#xD;
were tender, the mouth was set and almost&#xD;
stern-her heart died away within her. "I&#xD;
cannot, I cannot!" she thought. To do her&#xD;
justice, it was not cowardice alone that&#xD;
sealed her lips. The eyes, gazing into her&#xD;
own, seemed to her excited fancy like an em-&#xD;
bodiment of all the love and care which had&#xD;
been given to her since the first hour in&#xD;
which the roof of Wyverne had sheltered&#xD;
her helpless orphanhood. Were ever parents&#xD;
kinder or more indulgent than her uncle and&#xD;
aunt, was ever brother more tender, was ever&#xD;
lover more devoted, than Ralph? A vision&#xD;
of her petted, luxurious life rose before the&#xD;
girl. They had given her every thing which&#xD;
was theirs to give. It was for her to decide&#xD;
what should be their reward.&#xD;
Then even in this foolish and reckless&#xD;
heart, a mighty impulse of self-abnegating&#xD;
gratitude rose. "Ralph," she cried, suddenly,&#xD;
"I was not thinking of myself; I was only&#xD;
thinking of you! I will do whatever you&#xD;
wish, dear; but you must remember that-&#xD;
that I knew how it would be, when I disap.&#xD;
point you in every thing, and make you&#xD;
wretched."&#xD;
"I am not afraid of that, my darling,"&#xD;
&#xD;
ONEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
NINA'S 2&#xD;
&#xD;
said Ralph, with a great wave of gladness&#xD;
coming over his face. He did not exactly&#xD;
understand Nina, having never known her to&#xD;
be seized with a fit of humility before-but&#xD;
a load seemed lifted from him when he found&#xD;
that this was nil she meant. Only a fear lest&#xD;
she should make him wretched! He laughed&#xD;
outright. "My pretty one," be said, with ca-&#xD;
ressing tenderness, "even to look at you is&#xD;
enough to bring sunlight and gladness to a&#xD;
man's heart."&#xD;
"But I shall not be pretty always," said&#xD;
~ina. She almost hated her prettiness at&#xD;
that moment. It was the root of all her&#xD;
trouble. But for the entrancing bloom of&#xD;
her skin, the moist scarlet of her lips~ the&#xD;
liquid lustre of her eyes, Ralph would never&#xD;
have desired to marry her, Martindale would&#xD;
never have tarried at Wyverne over fruitless&#xD;
experiments in chemistry, the discontent and&#xD;
cager longing which burned within her like a&#xD;
flame would never have found birth. ~' If I&#xD;
had been ugly, I should have been domestic,"&#xD;
she thought, with a momentary yearning for&#xD;
a sallow skin and dull eyes. "Ugly women&#xD;
always are domestic-they have no tempta-&#xD;
tion to be any thing else."&#xD;
Meanwhile Ralph was saying, with that&#xD;
air of affectionate solicitude which is so de-&#xD;
lightful when the affection is returned, but so&#xD;
terribly irksome when it is not: "My darling,&#xD;
there is something you must do for me. Did&#xD;
I not hear mother say that you are going&#xD;
with her to Elkbridge for some shopping to-&#xD;
day? Promise me that while you are there&#xD;
you will call and see Dr. Shelton. I am not&#xD;
quite easy about you."&#xD;
"There is nothing the matter with me,"&#xD;
said Nina-" at least nothing which Dr. Shel-&#xD;
ton can cure. if I went to see him, it could&#xD;
only be to ask if he could 'minister to a mind&#xD;
diseased.' I think my mind must be diseased,&#xD;
else I should never have been so foolish as I&#xD;
have been this morning. But I see the car~&#xD;
riage coming round, and I have not changed&#xD;
my dress yet. I had almost forgotten that I&#xD;
was going to Elkbridge with Aunt Essie."&#xD;
She turned away quickly-glad to escape&#xD;
from the eyes which had all of love's eager-&#xD;
ness and something of love's keenness in&#xD;
them-and, hurrying out of the room, did not&#xD;
pause until she was safe within the shelter of&#xD;
her own chamber, a cool, bowery apartment&#xD;
with a delicious green light from its half-&#xD;
closed blinds, and a whiff of ottar of roses on&#xD;
&#xD;
the air. On her knees beside the bed, acros~&#xD;
which a pretty light silk was lying, Nins&#xD;
flung herself-but not to pray. Only to bur~&#xD;
her face in the Marseilles counterpane an&#xD;
smother the dry, stormy sobs that were slink&#xD;
lug her whole frame.&#xD;
"What am I to do? Oh, what am 1 t(&#xD;
do?" she panted. "It would be a blacked&#xD;
ingratitude than even I am capable of to leav&#xD;
them, as lie wishes me to do; and yet-I thinhi&#xD;
I shall go mad if Ralph talks to me and looks&#xD;
at me again as he did a little while ago! Te&#xD;
see the love and trust in his eyes, and to think&#xD;
how I have betrayed the one and forfeited the&#xD;
other, is more than I can bear! Oh, what&#xD;
am I to do? To keep my engagement and&#xD;
make myself miserable, or to break it and&#xD;
make him wretched? Yet have I indeed a&#xD;
liberty of choice?" She sprang to her feet&#xD;
and began to pace the floor. "Have they not&#xD;
bought me-these good, kind, tame, stupid&#xD;
people-and paid my value a hundred times&#xD;
over?" Her glance traveled from the silk&#xD;
dress on the bed to a set of pearls-Ralph's&#xD;
birthday present-on the toilet-table. "Sure-&#xD;
ly my red-and-white beauty is not worth a&#xD;
higher price than the lavish indulgence which&#xD;
these things represent. But freedom !-are&#xD;
they worthy to be the price of freedom?"&#xD;
Her hands clasped and unclasped nervously;&#xD;
her impatient glance swept round the room&#xD;
as if its walls suffocated her; at that moment&#xD;
she looked like some wild thing of the forest&#xD;
pent within a cage. "it is a good thing that&#xD;
this cannot last long!" she thought, snatch-&#xD;
ing from her white throat a band of velvet,&#xD;
which felt as if it was choking her. "It is a&#xD;
good thing that my wedding-day is only two&#xD;
weeks distant. Whatever is to be decided,&#xD;
must be decided soon; whatever is to be&#xD;
done, must be done before then. What it&#xD;
will he, Heaven only knows. I know noth-&#xD;
ing except that I have not courage to be&#xD;
either wholly true or wholly false. Every&#xD;
thing would be easier if I were better, or-&#xD;
worse!"&#xD;
And little as Nina suspected it, she epit-&#xD;
omized her whole character in those words.&#xD;
Every thing would have been easier with her&#xD;
if she had been either better or worse-if she&#xD;
had stood upon a higher or lower plane of ac-&#xD;
tion and feeling. As it was, she succumbed&#xD;
to a temptation which a nobler nature would&#xD;
have resisted, while she stood firm where a&#xD;
more selfish nature would have given way, and&#xD;
&#xD;
ATONEMENT.                            23&#xD;
walked over all obstacles to its end. In the&#xD;
vortex of conflicting circumstance thus cre-&#xD;
ated, it was she who was rent and torn by the&#xD;
I struggle she had provoked, and out of which&#xD;
- came neither victory nor defeat; it was she&#xD;
who learned that to pause~midway between&#xD;
good and evil, to strive to reconcile honor&#xD;
and dishonor, truth and falsehood, is the most&#xD;
hopeless problem that a human soul can pos-&#xD;
sibly attempt to solve.&#xD;
When she came downstairs to accompany&#xD;
Mrs. Wyverne on the shopping expedition to&#xD;
Elkbridge, no one would have giwssed from&#xD;
her glowing cheeks and shining eyes what&#xD;
had given such bloom to the one, such light&#xD;
to the other. "I never saw you looking bet-&#xD;
ter, Nina," said Mrs. Wyverne, as they drove&#xD;
off. "It must be the color of your dress&#xD;
which is so becoming-or else the shape of&#xD;
your hat. We will go to the photograph-gal-&#xD;
lery while we are in Elkbridge; 1 have been&#xD;
promising your likeness to my sister for some&#xD;
time. She is anxious to see what Ralph's fu.&#xD;
ture wife looks like."&#xD;
"I hope she will be satisfied with Ralph's&#xD;
taste," saidNina. "I am not sure of it, how~&#xD;
ever, for photographs never give an idea of&#xD;
complexion; and you know, Aunt Essie, my&#xD;
nose is not straight."&#xD;
The shopping did not include any very ex-&#xD;
tensive purchases-for Mrs. Wyverne had too&#xD;
much regard for fashion to patronize to any&#xD;
great extent the shopkeepers and dress-zank-&#xD;
era of a country-town-but a little of that&#xD;
amusement can readily be spread over a large&#xD;
amount of time, especially with the aid of a&#xD;
few visits, and an hour or two in a photo-&#xD;
graph-gallery. Therefore, it chanced that the&#xD;
two ladies spent the day in Elkbridge, and&#xD;
that the sun was sinking when they entered&#xD;
the gates of Wyverne. "There is nobody at&#xD;
home," said Nina, glancing along the front of&#xD;
the house, as they approached. The next in-&#xD;
stant, however, she started back, for when&#xD;
they stopped Martindale appeared from some&#xD;
quarter, and opened the carriage-door.&#xD;
"You see there is somebody at home,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Wyverne, with a laugh..-L" Are you&#xD;
all alone, Mr. Martindale?" she added, as he&#xD;
assisted her to alight. "We were just say-&#xD;
ing that the house looked entirely deserted."&#xD;
"It has been deserted by every one but&#xD;
mc since mid-day," answered Martindale. " I&#xD;
am to blame foi~ my solitude, however. Ralph&#xD;
invited me to accompany Mr. Wyverne and&#xD;

NII{A'S ATONEMENT.                   2&#xD;

24              NINA'S ATONEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
himself to what he called 'the lower planta-&#xD;
tion,' but I declined, on the score of exces-&#xD;
sive laziness and excessive heat. In fact, I&#xD;
hoped you would be back in time for our&#xD;
ride," he said, looking at Nina.&#xD;
"We ~ere detained in Elkbridge," an-&#xD;
swered she, a little coldly. She was busy&#xD;
gathering up the parcels scattered over the&#xD;
seat of the carriage, and did not look at him&#xD;
or notice his extended hand.&#xD;
"Never mind about those, Nina," said&#xD;
Mrs. Wyverne, from the shadow of the por-&#xD;
tico. ." I will send Ellen out for them. If&#xD;
you are as tired as I am, you will not care to&#xD;
bother about any thing of the kind. I am&#xD;
going to order some iced tea at once. How&#xD;
refreshing it is to get home after such a day!&#xD;
-Don't you think it is very warm, Mr. Mar-&#xD;
tindale?"&#xD;
But Martindale did not answer-in fact,&#xD;
he did not hear the question. He was look-&#xD;
ing at Nina, who at last descended from the&#xD;
carriage somewhat reluctantly, and without&#xD;
his assistance. Her delay was its own pun-&#xD;
ishment, however, for, when she gained the&#xD;
portico, Mrs. Wyverne had disappeared into&#xD;
the house, and she found herself alone with&#xD;
Martindale.&#xD;
"What is the matter?" he said, quickly,&#xD;
almost imperiously. "What h~s occurred&#xD;
that you are so changed? Nina, what is the&#xD;
meaning of this?"&#xD;
"Am I changed?" asked Nina. She&#xD;
gave a short laugh. "If you will come into&#xD;
the drawing-room, I will tell you the meaning&#xD;
of it-perhaps it is better over at once."&#xD;
She turned and led the way across the&#xD;
large, cool hail into the drawing-room, full&#xD;
just then of a wonderful sunset glow; which&#xD;
streamed through the wide western windows.&#xD;
As she paused in the centre of the floor, and&#xD;
turned toward Martindale, this glory seemed&#xD;
to surround her like a luminous atmosphere,&#xD;
lighting her hair into more than Titianesque&#xD;
richness, and giving her face a beauty that&#xD;
he~ never forgot. He almost caught his&#xD;
breath. At that moment he could think of&#xD;
nothing but the loveliness which in this very&#xD;
spot had first fascinated him.&#xD;
"Nina!" he cried, "if I could only paint&#xD;
you as you stand there now, what a picture it&#xD;
would make! My darling, my beautiful dar-&#xD;
hing, what a sensation you will create in the&#xD;
world!"&#xD;
"I shall never go into the world!" said&#xD;
&#xD;
Nina, bitterly. It was better to get it over&#xD;
at once, she thought, especially since the old&#xD;
wild thrill leaped into longing life at his&#xD;
words. "That was what I came to say," she&#xD;
went on, facing him with great, steady, lus-&#xD;
trous eyes. "It must all end. I shall never&#xD;
go into the world. I shall stay here and&#xD;
marry Ralph."&#xD;
She uttered the last words bravely, though&#xD;
a great choking wave seemed to rise up in&#xD;
her throat. It was as if her own hand rolled&#xD;
a stone to the door of her sepulchre. Stay&#xD;
at Wyverne and marry Ralph! A picture of&#xD;
what her life would be rose before her as she&#xD;
uttered the words. The suffocating sense&#xD;
which had oppressed her in the morning came&#xD;
back. The dreary monotony of days and&#xD;
years seemed stretching before her. Looking&#xD;
at Martindale, she felt a strange mixture of&#xD;
relief and anger to see that he was smiling.&#xD;
"Stay here and marry Ralph!" he re-&#xD;
peated, and her ear caught the vibration of&#xD;
absolute amusement in his tone. "Is that&#xD;
all that is the matter? Qarissima! you star-&#xD;
tled me horribly. I feared-I scarcely knew&#xD;
what, from your manner. Trust to me, sweet&#xD;
one, and don't disquiet yourself like this.&#xD;
Remember that it is too late to talk of ending&#xD;
any thing now. You have placed your life in&#xD;
my hands, and I will take care of it."&#xD;
"I have not placed my life in your bands,"&#xD;
said Nina. It was impossible to say whether&#xD;
she felt most strongly repelled or strangely&#xD;
fascinated by this haughty dictation. "I&#xD;
was only mad enough to-to forget what I&#xD;
owe Ralph. But I remember it now. Such&#xD;
a faith as mine is poor indeed to give him,&#xD;
but he thinks it something, and I-I cannot&#xD;
undeceive him. It is better to let him be&#xD;
happy with an unworthy wife, than to make&#xD;
him miserable by telling him what I am."&#xD;
"This is all nonsense," said Martindale,&#xD;
coolly. "I told you, before I had any reason&#xD;
whatever to believe you loved me, that I&#xD;
meant to win you, Nina. Do you seriously&#xD;
think that now-now that you have assured&#xD;
me in word, and look, and tone, of your love&#xD;
-that I will give you up at any bidding under&#xD;
Heaven?"&#xD;
"You will have no choice but to give me&#xD;
up at my own!" said Nina, becoming haughty&#xD;
in turn.&#xD;
But he only laughed-laughed as he might&#xD;
have done at the petulance of a child. "Sweet-&#xD;
heart," he said, "is it possible you are so&#xD;
&#xD;
foolish as not to see that you have gone toc&#xD;
far to turn back? It is natural that you&#xD;
should feel in this way-I expected it-but it&#xD;
is childish to imagine that, because you opened&#xD;
a dam, you can stop a flood. We may alter&#xD;
circumstances, but we cannot control them.&#xD;
You are mine. It is too late to talk of mar-&#xD;
rying Ralph Wyverne now."&#xD;
"It is not too late for any thing I may&#xD;
choose to do," said Nina, with a flash of her&#xD;
old defiance. "I have been a fool, I know,"&#xD;
she went on, bitterly "I have let you amuse&#xD;
yourself with me to the top of your bent "-&#xD;
her lip curled in that self-contempt which, to&#xD;
a proud nature, is of all things on earth the&#xD;
hardest to endure-" but I am not quite ready&#xD;
to let you dictate what my whole life shall&#xD;
be. Our flirtation, or whatever you may&#xD;
choose to call it, is at an end."&#xD;
"Our flirtation ended some time ago,"&#xD;
said Martindale, quietly; but she caught a&#xD;
sudden gleam in his eyes as the handsome&#xD;
brows above them knitted. "Our engage-&#xD;
ment, however, will not end until you are my&#xD;
wife."&#xD;
"I shall never be your wife!" said Nina,&#xD;
passionately. It was impossible to under-&#xD;
stand this girL She scarcely understood her-&#xD;
self-she scarcely knew what she wished, de-&#xD;
sired, or intended to do. Just then she re-&#xD;
belled against the power which Martindale&#xD;
assumed, as she had rebelled against her life&#xD;
and all the circumstances of it. Ralph's ca-&#xD;
ressing tenderness came back to her. After&#xD;
all, she was not sure that she did not prefer a&#xD;
subject to a maste~'. "I will never be your&#xD;
wife!" she repeated, with a glow of added&#xD;
color on her face, a flash of new light in her&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"Will you not?" said Martindale. He&#xD;
could have laughed at the foolish coquetry&#xD;
which fancied that it could play fast and&#xD;
loose with him, but he was also angry-so&#xD;
angry, that Nina was startled by the white&#xD;
sternness which came over his face. "Again&#xD;
I tell you that this is folly!" he said. "I do&#xD;
not doubt that you are like all the rest of your&#xD;
sex-more than ready to make a fool of any&#xD;
man who chooses to give you his love for a&#xD;
plaything-but you will not make either a&#xD;
fool or a plaything of me. You will be m~y&#xD;
wift / I have told you so before, I tell you&#xD;
so again. You do not half know me, Nina,&#xD;
if you fancy that any thing can stand be-&#xD;
tween us now!"&#xD;
&#xD;
No, she did not half know him. Some-&#xD;
thing like a realization of that came to Nina&#xD;
as she looked at the face before her-a pas-&#xD;
sionate, stern face, with the resolution in it&#xD;
deepening as she gazed, until duller eyes&#xD;
might have read a determination which would&#xD;
heed no obstacles to its end.&#xD;
"I have brought this on myself~" she said.&#xD;
"I have no right to complain. But you have&#xD;
no right to speak so to me. I have forgotten&#xD;
a great deal for you, but I cannot forget every&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"And yet that is what you must do 1"&#xD;
he said. "You must forget every thing and&#xD;
everybody connected with your past life, and&#xD;
come with me. You must not look back and&#xD;
try to reconcile the past with the future. It&#xD;
can never be!" Then he took her bands and&#xD;
drew icr to him - more compellingly than&#xD;
tenderly. "Let us have done with this!"&#xD;
he said. "Nina, you are mine! Do you not&#xD;
love me well enough to be glad of it?"&#xD;
But Nina drew back.&#xD;
"How can I be yours," she said, "when&#xD;
I am engaged to Ralph? Surely" (with a&#xD;
bitter laugh) "I cannot belong to both of&#xD;
you. 1 say again, that I have been mad and&#xD;
foolish, but I never meant to marry you.&#xD;
You ought to know that."&#xD;
"You mean that you have been deliber-&#xD;
ately trifling with me!" said he, a dark fire&#xD;
gathering in his eye, a red flush mounting&#xD;
to his brow.&#xD;
"If I did mean that," said she, with a&#xD;
flash of spirit, "you would have no right to&#xD;
complain. Did you not intend to trifle with&#xD;
me, when you remained here after having told&#xD;
Ralph that his 'idea' ~was worth nothing?"&#xD;
"No," answered he, quietly. "I never&#xD;
meant to trifle with you. I stayed here sim-&#xD;
ply and solely because I loved you and meant&#xD;
to win you."&#xD;
"And do you call that honorable to&#xD;
Ralph?" said she, indignantly.&#xD;
"Ralph!" repeated he, contemptuously.&#xD;
"Do you suppose I thought of Ralph? I&#xD;
only thought of you, Nina! Ralph was niere-&#xD;
ly the stepping - stone by whicl~i I reached&#xD;
you.~~&#xD;
"Poor Ralph l" said Nina. She put her&#xD;
hand quickly to her eyes. What right had&#xD;
she to blame Martindale when she considered&#xD;
how unscrupulously she had used and abused&#xD;
Ralph's great faith in her? A flood of remorse&#xD;
seemed suddenly to rush over her. The hand-&#xD;

&#xD;
some, imperious face before her vanished&#xD;
away; Ralph's loving eyes came back. At&#xD;
that moment she forgot the fair, broad free-&#xD;
dom of the world which lay beyond these&#xD;
quiet shades. She only thought of the love&#xD;
which had been disregarded, of the trust&#xD;
wbieh bad been betrayed. If she walked on&#xD;
to the life which was awaiting her-the life&#xD;
whose possibilities set her blood in a glow-&#xD;
she felt that she must walk over Ralph's&#xD;
heart. Could she do that? There are many&#xD;
women-some of whom would doubles~ think&#xD;
themselves much better than poor Ninti~'-who&#xD;
would not have hesitated an instant over&#xD;
such a necessity. But, with all her faults&#xD;
and impulses, Nina did hesitate. In fact, she&#xD;
did more than hesitate. She cried out pas-&#xD;
sionately: "We have both betrayed his trust&#xD;
in us-but I am the most to blame I I can.&#xD;
try to atone by keeping faith with him; but,&#xD;
oh, what an atonement it will be!"&#xD;
"It would be a foolish self-sacrifice that&#xD;
could only end by making him as wretched as&#xD;
it would make you!" said Martindale. "Nina,&#xD;
can you not recognize the folly of all this?&#xD;
Why should you waste your strength against&#xD;
the inevitable? You could as soon call back&#xD;
the sun, which has just set, into mid-heaven,&#xD;
as set aside the consequences which must&#xD;
flow from an accomplished fact. We can&#xD;
none of us escape the necessity of giving as&#xD;
well as of receiving pain. If we paused at&#xD;
every step in life to think what heart we&#xD;
should crush, we would never be likely to&#xD;
advance. You were born to crush hearts!"&#xD;
he said, with a proud, passionate tenderness.&#xD;
"Just now you must choose between mine&#xD;
and Ralph's. Which is it to be?"&#xD;
"I do not owe you what I owe Ralph,"&#xD;
said Nina, looking up.&#xD;
But, all the same, she felt that she had&#xD;
failed in this first contest of opposing wills.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
Buy this first contest was only the key-&#xD;
K note of a struggle to come-a struggle which&#xD;
grew in intensity day by day, as the time for&#xD;
Nina~ s marriage approached, and, as Martin-&#xD;
dale began to realize that it would prove more&#xD;
difficult than he imagined to sway her to his'&#xD;
purpose. He found that a change had come&#xD;
over the girl-a change which struck below&#xD;
the surface, and which puzzled even while it&#xD;
&#xD;
angered him. For a while he doubted its&#xD;
genuineness: it was nothing more than an&#xD;
impulse of generosity, he thought, or else one&#xD;
of those tricks of coquetry which women of&#xD;
all ages a~d all countries understand so well.&#xD;
But, a~ time went on, he could no longer treat&#xD;
it with noncludant coolness; he was forced&#xD;
to believe that Nina was in earnest when she&#xD;
declared her intention of keeping faith with&#xD;
Ralph. It was then that he began to appre-&#xD;
ciate how much he had overrated his influ-&#xD;
ence with her. It was then that he first be-&#xD;
gan to understand that she had only meant&#xD;
to amuse herself- only meant to feed her&#xD;
vanity and test her power with his homage-&#xD;
and that, although she had been drawn, by&#xD;
the strong force of will rather than by the&#xD;
strong force of attraction, further than she&#xD;
intended, she had never seriously meant to&#xD;
surrender for his sake any one of the substan-&#xD;
tial advantages which opened before her as&#xD;
Ralph Wyverne's wife.&#xD;
At least this was Martindale's way of put-&#xD;
ting it. Recognizing with a start that he had&#xD;
never wakened more than that flattered fancy&#xD;
which the impressionable heart of a girl yields&#xD;
readily enough to the first comer, and that&#xD;
in this fancy there was no element of that&#xD;
love which heeds no obstacles to its end, he&#xD;
did not recognize how much the girl had to&#xD;
resist in her cager longing for the world, and&#xD;
those things of the world which he embodied.&#xD;
Finding that she stood firm in her resolution&#xD;
'of marrying Ralph, it would be hard to say&#xD;
how much of foiled desire, of wounded vanity,&#xD;
and outraged bitterness, gathered in his con-&#xD;
sideration of the manner in which she had&#xD;
"trifled" with him. No man likes his own&#xD;
weapons to be turned against him in such&#xD;
fashion; but Martiadale liked it less even&#xD;
than most men. He had good reason for&#xD;
thinking that he knew the world more than&#xD;
ordinarily well, and he felt deeply that he had&#xD;
been "made a fool of" by a girl whose expe-&#xD;
rience of society began and ended in the stag-&#xD;
nant country neighborhood around her. If&#xD;
this pang of mortified vanity-keen as it was&#xD;
-had been all the trouble, however, he might&#xD;
have shaken the dust of Wyverne off his feet&#xD;
in disgust, and left Nina to the fate she had&#xD;
chosen. Unfortunately, however, there were&#xD;
graver passions in reserve-passions that be-&#xD;
gan ~o rouse themselves in ominous sternness&#xD;
when he saw the beautiful prize, which he&#xD;
had determined to call his own, in danger&#xD;
&#xD;
of passing from him. Never before had it&#xD;
seemed so well worth winning! Never had&#xD;
Nina seemed so well worth any sacrifice or&#xD;
exertion, as when she set her will against his&#xD;
own, and declared her intention of fulfilling&#xD;
her engagement! Never had his determina-&#xD;
tion waxed greater than when she enraged&#xD;
him by an opposition on which he had not&#xD;
counted, by a defiance of which he had not&#xD;
dreamed! And, in order that this determi-&#xD;
nation may be appreciated at its full value, it&#xD;
must be said that Martindale was troubled&#xD;
with singularly few scruples, and that he pos-&#xD;
sessed in marked degree a resolutioxi so in-&#xD;
domitable that he had learned to think it&#xD;
invincible. Add to this, intense passions, to-&#xD;
gether with a very small amount of what&#xD;
phrenologists call "conscientiousness," and&#xD;
the most tranquil ignorance might imagine&#xD;
that the combination could not fail to be dan-&#xD;
gerous, let it be veiled by never so much of&#xD;
that graceful indifference which our nine-&#xD;
teenth-century civilization has taught its men&#xD;
and women to cultivate. Vesuvius is none&#xD;
the less Vesuvius because gardens are planted&#xD;
on its slope; the volcano is not extinct, and,&#xD;
when its lava bursts forth, the gardens fare&#xD;
but ill.&#xD;
It is useless to say that, if Nina had&#xD;
known any thing of the character of the man&#xD;
with whom she had "amused" herself, she&#xD;
might have felt that he was right in telling&#xD;
her that it was too late to think of disowning&#xD;
the consequences of her folly, too late to&#xD;
dream of atonement to Ralph, too late for&#xD;
any attempt at controlling the demon of cir-&#xD;
cumstance she had evoked. But she was too&#xD;
inexperienced to form any judgment of char-&#xD;
acter in the concrete. Judging in the ab-&#xD;
stract, she conceived Martindale to be like&#xD;
all other men of his class of whom she had&#xD;
heard and read, quick enough to amuse him-&#xD;
self with a pretty face, but ready enough also&#xD;
to see when the amusement was over, and to&#xD;
go his way with due philosophy and an un-&#xD;
broken heart. Strong passions and desperate&#xD;
deeds were quite out of fashion nowadays,&#xD;
she thought. It was only in old romances&#xD;
that men were incited to either or both by&#xD;
the magic of a woman's fair face. Other&#xD;
people besides Nina think these things. Other&#xD;
people, also, wake to find that this old, wicked&#xD;
human nature of ours is the same to-day as&#xD;
yesterday, the same yesterday as three hun-&#xD;
dred or three thousand years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
Yet, despite this comfortable assurance,&#xD;
these days were very terrible to Nina. The&#xD;
girl felt as if she moved in a vague, dreadful&#xD;
mist. She was living a dual life, and she&#xD;
sometimes stopped to ask herself which of&#xD;
the two existences was real. On one side&#xD;
was all the preparation for her marriage-&#xD;
that preparation which agitates the ordinary&#xD;
feminine mind and the ordinary domestic&#xD;
household so deeply-.-Mrs. Wyverne's ani-&#xD;
mated bustle over the trousseau, the wedding-&#xD;
cards, the wedding-breakfast- every thing&#xD;
connected with the wedding, in fact-and&#xD;
Ralph's quiet but tender certainty of happi-&#xD;
ness. On the other was Martindale's fiery&#xD;
passion, his vehement pleading, his arbitrary&#xD;
assertions of power, the struggle ever re-&#xD;
newed yet never ended, and, above all, the&#xD;
alluring temptation of freedom-freedom so&#xD;
near that she had but to stretch out her hand&#xD;
and take it, yet so far away, since she could&#xD;
not harden her heart sufficiently to stretch&#xD;
out that hand.&#xD;
It was no wonder that the bright cheek&#xD;
grew pale, or that dark circles sprung for the&#xD;
first time into existence under the sunny eyes,&#xD;
even during this short fortnight. Few of us&#xD;
have not learned to our cost how much of&#xD;
emotion can be compressed into the space of&#xD;
a few days-nay, even of a few hours. And,&#xD;
epicurean though she was, Nina suffered as&#xD;
she enjoyed-with her whole soul. She had&#xD;
never mastered-it is doubtful if by any pos-&#xD;
sibility she ever could have mastered-the&#xD;
phlegmatic impossibility which is the grand&#xD;
talisman of selfish happiness. Hers was a&#xD;
wholly different temperament - a tempera-&#xD;
ment that, for all its intense love of pleasure,&#xD;
could not divorce its energy even from pain,&#xD;
and, despite its fitful waywardness, pos-&#xD;
sessed impulses of generosity that scarcely&#xD;
hesitated at any height of self-sacrifice.&#xD;
"You may make this sacrifice," Martindale&#xD;
said, "but you will not have strength enough&#xD;
to abide by it." And, in truth, this was where&#xD;
Nina failed. She had sufficient enthusiasm&#xD;
and unselfishness for a quick martyrdom;&#xD;
but, for that slow martyrdom of the soul&#xD;
which we call the death of hope, sh~c possessed&#xD;
neither courage nor strength. An observation&#xD;
less keen than Martindale's might have pre-&#xD;
dicted that, if she married Ralph Wyverne,&#xD;
she would not even sink into the apathy which&#xD;
with many women does duty for resignation,&#xD;
but would rather eat out her heart in long-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
ings and desires as bitter as they were fruit-&#xD;
less.&#xD;
Time, which stands still for no man, rolled&#xD;
swiftly on, meanwhile, and the date appointed&#xD;
for the marriage drew very near. During&#xD;
these days, the household at Wyverne saw&#xD;
but little of Martindale. All of the day, and&#xD;
most of the night, he spent in the laboratory,&#xD;
generally working with closed doors. Even&#xD;
Ralph knew little of what he was about. In&#xD;
fact, just then Ralph was thinking of other&#xD;
things. The near approach of matrimony&#xD;
banished even chemistry from his mind-be-&#xD;
sides which, Mr. Wyverne chanced to be&#xD;
"laid up" with an attack of gout; and this&#xD;
indisposition naturally threw an added amount&#xD;
of business into his son's hands. In days of&#xD;
~vell-organized labor, it was no trifle to keep&#xD;
the eye of a master on two large plantations;&#xD;
but in these days the necessity of supervision&#xD;
is increased by ten- if not by twenty-fold.&#xD;
Hence Ralph was busy, and business dulls&#xD;
men's faculties of observation. He had only&#xD;
a vague idea of what Martindale was doing,&#xD;
and, although he saw that l~ina was looking&#xD;
rather pale, he thought that it would be "all&#xD;
right" after they were married, and had left&#xD;
home for that change of air which is con-&#xD;
sidered beneficial for newly-married people.&#xD;
"Have you seen any thing of Martindale&#xD;
to-day, Nina?" he asked one afternoon when&#xD;
he had come in tired from a ride of several&#xD;
miles, and flung himself at luxurious full&#xD;
length on a couch in the hall, where Nina&#xD;
chanced to be sitting.&#xD;
"Very little," she answered, quietly. Her&#xD;
hands were clasped idly over a novel which&#xD;
she had not been reading, her eyes gazed&#xD;
wistfully out of the broad, open door to the&#xD;
afternoon lights and shadows that were&#xD;
cheekering the lawn beyond. Just then it&#xD;
occurred to her with a thrill of relief that&#xD;
there were only three more days of this to be&#xD;
endured. Three days hence she would be&#xD;
married and gone-never likely, she hoped&#xD;
and trusted, to see Martindale again.&#xD;
"I must go down and look in on that fel-&#xD;
low," Ralph was, meanwhile, saying lazily.&#xD;
"He told me yesterday that he was devoting&#xD;
himself to my experiments, and had made&#xD;
some progress in them. He seems wonder-&#xD;
fully well satisfied wirh his quarters. He&#xD;
says he has never before been able to test in&#xD;
a thoroughly satisfactory manner some ideas&#xD;
of his own. I told him I hoped he would&#xD;
&#xD;
stay here while we were gone, and, when we&#xD;
come back, I shall be more at leisure, and we&#xD;
can go over the result of all that he has done."&#xD;
"Ralph I "-it was a low, quivering cry&#xD;
that absolutely made Ralph start-" you sure.&#xD;
ly have not done such a thing as that? You&#xD;
surely have not asked that man to stay hero&#xD;
when you know how much l-I distrust him?"&#xD;
"Yes, I have," said Ralph. He was quite&#xD;
astonished, and raised himself on his elbow.&#xD;
"I am sorry if you don't like it," he went on,&#xD;
after a moment, "but really, Nina, I had no&#xD;
idea that your dislike of Martindale went so&#xD;
far as this. I am sure im thinks veryhighly&#xD;
of iou, and-"&#xD;
"I did not say that I disliked him, Ralph,"&#xD;
she interrupted, with a painful flush, "but&#xD;
that I distrust him. I do not think his ex-&#xD;
periments will ever come to any thing, and I&#xD;
am sorry there is any prospect of his being&#xD;
here when we return. I-I was only just&#xD;
thinking that it would be a relief to be alone?'&#xD;
"I wonder I did not think of that my-&#xD;
self," said Ralph, looking as much discom-&#xD;
fited as a large Newfoundland does when, by&#xD;
some piece of amateur sagacity, he incurs&#xD;
scolding instead of commendation. "It was&#xD;
stupid of me, but I really did not think that&#xD;
Martindale mattered. I thought you had&#xD;
grown to like him famously-and then the&#xD;
chemistry, Nina!. I should like to go to that&#xD;
in earnest when we come back."&#xD;
"Can't you go to it by yourself?" asked&#xD;
Nina. But she heaved a weary sigh. She*&#xD;
knew that even her influence reckoned for&#xD;
nothing when opposed to that of chemistry.&#xD;
"I don't know" answered Ralph, doubt-&#xD;
fully. "You see I have been so busy that I&#xD;
have not been able to keep up with what&#xD;
Martindale is doing. Unless he is here when&#xD;
I come back, therefore, his having been here&#xD;
at all will have done me little good."&#xD;
"Why did you bring him, then?'~ said&#xD;
Nina. Her hands wrung themselves tightly&#xD;
together. How lightly and idly this had been&#xD;
done which had changed the whole current&#xD;
and meaning of her life!&#xD;
"I have told you all about that," said&#xD;
Ralph, sinking back on his cushions. "I&#xD;
was sorry for having brought him when I&#xD;
found you did not like him, and I am still&#xD;
more sorry for having so thoughtlessly asked&#xD;
him to prolong his visit; but I can't get out&#xD;
of it now, you know," said the honest, hos-&#xD;
pitable fellow&#xD;
&#xD;
NINA'3 2&#xD;
&#xD;
"One can't ask one's guest to leave, cer.&#xD;
mainly," said Nina, bitterly. "But the guesi&#xD;
himself may sometimes have discretion enough~&#xD;
to see that it would be well to do so."&#xD;
"Not unless he perceives that his pres.&#xD;
ence is disagreeable," said Ralph, adding, a&#xD;
little indignantly, "I would infinitely rather&#xD;
show a man out of my house than treat him&#xD;
with incivility in it."&#xD;
"I was not thinking of treating him with&#xD;
incivility," said Nina, half absently. "You&#xD;
ought to know that, Ralph. No one is more&#xD;
Arabian in his ideas of hospitality than I&#xD;
am; 1?ut-did Mr. Martindale say that he&#xD;
would remain?" she interrupted herself by&#xD;
asking, looking quickly at her cousin.&#xD;
"He made a sort of half promise-his&#xD;
movements were uncertain for the next&#xD;
month, be said; but he added that, if we rc-&#xD;
mained as long as we intended, we should&#xD;
probably find him here when we returned."&#xD;
There was silence for a minute after this.&#xD;
The drowsy stillness of a summer afternoon&#xD;
seemed to brood over the house; now and then&#xD;
a gentle snore came from the library where&#xD;
Mr. Wyverne was enjoying a 8ze515; a few flies&#xD;
were lazily buzzing about-.Keeper, the great&#xD;
inastiff snapped at them occasionally; the&#xD;
lastrays of the sun were streaming across the&#xD;
terrace, and reddening the cedar.hedge. Nina&#xD;
watched it all as in a dream. She was won.&#xD;
during what M~frtindale meant, and how she&#xD;
could best prevent any thing 59 terrible as it&#xD;
would be to find him at Wyverne when she&#xD;
came back from her bridal tour.&#xD;
After a while she rose. Ralph was tired,&#xD;
and, finding himself in a very comfortable&#xD;
position, he had fallen asleep with that air of&#xD;
supreme, restful enjoyment which we notice&#xD;
in the slumbers of children and dogs. With&#xD;
one glance at his placid, unconscious face,&#xD;
Nina took her garden.hat from a table near&#xD;
by, and went out of the open door.&#xD;
She walked slowly around the terrace,&#xD;
pondering whether or not she was wise in&#xD;
seeking Martiudale, as a sudden impulse&#xD;
prompted her to do. For several days she&#xD;
had studiously avoided the garden, where&#xD;
most of their interviews had taken place. The&#xD;
scenes of passionate struggle, which at first&#xD;
had been so exciting and pleasant, had of late&#xD;
wearied and torn and terrified her all at once.&#xD;
The old legends are right: "It is much easier&#xD;
to raise a fiend than to put him down again;"&#xD;
and there arc instances around us every day&#xD;

of people who, having tried the experiment,&#xD;
fare as badly as their incautious predecessors&#xD;
of the middle ages.&#xD;
Nina, unluckily for herself; was one of&#xD;
these. The fiend which she had raised proved&#xD;
totally beyond her powers of management.&#xD;
The stormy and exacting devotion for which&#xD;
she had longed was not half so entertaining&#xD;
as she had imagined it would be. During&#xD;
these days, she had turned more than once&#xD;
with a sense of absolute relief to Ralph's quiet&#xD;
affection and unwavering trust. As she went&#xD;
her way now-dawn the terrace. steps and&#xD;
along the garden-paths-she felt a shrinking&#xD;
in every fibre from the Scene before her. 11cr&#xD;
whole pleasure-loving nature rose up in re-&#xD;
volt against the pain and vexation which&#xD;
seemed to encompass her. "It is infamous!&#xD;
-he has no right to torment me so!" she&#xD;
said, setting her white teeth and clinching&#xD;
her soft hands. "I will not submit to it any&#xD;
longer.~~&#xD;
As she uttered these words half aloud,&#xD;
she turned into a path that led directly to the&#xD;
pavilion. It stood clearly before her at the&#xD;
end of the vista, a pretty and appropriate ad-&#xD;
junct to the luxuriant, old-fashioned garden.&#xD;
As she strolled slowly along-her steps un-&#xD;
consciously growing more lagging as she ap.&#xD;
proached-she saw a juvenile factotum of the&#xD;
establishment, black in color and Jack by&#xD;
name, emerge from the laboratory and ad-&#xD;
vance along the path toward her, swinging&#xD;
something in his hand. What this was she&#xD;
could not distinguish until, as he drew near,&#xD;
it proved to be a dead cat; which no sooner&#xD;
did Miss -Dalzell perceive, than she promptly&#xD;
and imperiously collared the bearer:&#xD;
"Where did that come from, Jack 1"' she&#xD;
demanded. "What are you doing with it?"&#xD;
"Mr. Martindale killed him, and telled Inc&#xD;
to take him and fling him away," said Jack,&#xD;
who had a wholesome fear of being arraigned&#xD;
for cruelty at the bar of "Miss Ninas" indig-&#xD;
nant justice.&#xD;
"Mr. Martindale killed it!" repeated&#xD;
Nina. She was on the point of saying, "How&#xD;
dare you tell me such a falsehood~"' when&#xD;
she remembered that the boy had come dowz~&#xD;
the laboratory-steps, which gave at least a&#xD;
plausible air to the statement. "Why did&#xD;
Mr. Martindale kill it?" she asked, suspicious-&#xD;
ly. "Is it not your mother's cat? Jack, if&#xD;
you are telling me what is not so-"&#xD;
"I ain't a-tellin' you what ain't so, Misu&#xD;

&#xD;
Nina," said Jack, filled With' a sense of vir-&#xD;
tuous innocence. "Mammy said Mr. Martin-&#xD;
gale might have old Tom for a dollar, an' he&#xD;
tole me to fotch him along, an' I done it, an'&#xD;
he killed him."&#xD;
"How did he kill him?" demanded Nina.&#xD;
She still looked at the speaker with an air of&#xD;
suspicion, which Jack felt to be hard to bear.&#xD;
"I dunno exactlyy how," he answered,&#xD;
shuffling one bare, black foot in the sand.&#xD;
" He never done nothing' to him. He jist put&#xD;
him under some kind of a glass thing, an' he&#xD;
dropped right down dead, as if he'd a bin&#xD;
shot."&#xD;
"I wonder if he is dead," said Nina. She&#xD;
examined the lax, inanimate form with tender&#xD;
fingers, while Jack looked on without much&#xD;
wonder; he knew "Miss Nina's ways." But&#xD;
it was all in vain. Science had done its work.&#xD;
Poor Tom was hopelessly dead; so, bidding&#xD;
Jack give him decent burial, Nina turned and&#xD;
walked away.&#xD;
She could not go to the laboratory after&#xD;
that. It was not only that she was revolted&#xD;
-unreasonably revolted, perhaps, after the&#xD;
manner of people who have not the love or&#xD;
the advancement of science at heart-by the&#xD;
cruelty of which she had just heard, but a&#xD;
sudden strange sense of terror came over her.&#xD;
She told herself that it was irrational, but she&#xD;
could not reason it away. Of course, she had&#xD;
always known what deadly forces lurked in&#xD;
chemistry; she had also been aware that Mar-&#xD;
tindale, in pursuit of an "idea" of hig own,&#xD;
had been experimenting for some time in poi-&#xD;
sonous gases; and she knew, as everybody&#xD;
knows, how ruthlessly the devotees of science&#xD;
sacrifice God's helpless creatures on their&#xD;
altar. But, despite all this, she could not&#xD;
drive away that chill sense of impending evil&#xD;
which had come so suddenly, and with which&#xD;
we are all familiar-which we call a presenti-&#xD;
ment when it is fulfilled, and which we forgot&#xD;
with so much ease when it is unfulfilled. She&#xD;
was aware that it probably arose from her&#xD;
own overwrought frame of mind; yet, when&#xD;
she turned aside and sat down in a little rose-&#xD;
arborher heart was beating like that of some&#xD;
frightened wild creature. The sun was gone&#xD;
by this time, and the lovely, fragrant twilight&#xD;
had fallen over the earth. But Nina had no&#xD;
heed for it. "I am a fool!" she thought,&#xD;
angrily. "I am worse than a fool! But how&#xD;
terrible-oh, how terrible-for any one to&#xD;
hold such power as that!" Then she thought:&#xD;
&#xD;
"He must go away! I do not trust him; I&#xD;
said I did not trust him, from the first. God&#xD;
forgive me, if I am wronging him, as we&#xD;
should not wrong our worst enemy-but there&#xD;
is something dreadful about him! I have felt&#xD;
that, and yet I have told myself that it was&#xD;
folly. But he must go-even if I have to tell&#xD;
Ralph the truth."&#xD;
Yet she felt that, to tell Ralph the trutb,&#xD;
would be to put out of the question the sac-&#xD;
rifice which she desired to make for him.&#xD;
Dearly as he loved her, bitterly as it would&#xD;
pain him to surrender her, Ralph Wyverne was&#xD;
made of better stuff than to accept any wo-&#xD;
man's hapd-even that of the woman he loved&#xD;
best on earth-if it were given unwillingly.&#xD;
If he had once known how Nina's impatient&#xD;
heart yearned for the freedom of the world,&#xD;
for a life and love such as he could not give&#xD;
her, he would have been the first to snap&#xD;
asunder the link which bound them to each&#xD;
other; and of this fact no one was more&#xD;
thoroughly aware than the girl who sat there&#xD;
under the roses, gazing with absent eyes and&#xD;
overclouded brow at the wealth of summer&#xD;
bloom and beauty around her&#xD;
But, despite the anxious thoughts which&#xD;
overshadowed her, she made a picture that&#xD;
stirred Martiidale's heart into a tumult of ad.&#xD;
migration when he came round a turn of the&#xD;
path upon her. He had caught a glimpse of&#xD;
her white dress from the laboratory, and fol-&#xD;
lowed as quickly as possible; but, not look-&#xD;
ing for her just here, the sudden spell of her&#xD;
loveliness - framed' by the green vines and&#xD;
hanging roses-moved him the more strongly&#xD;
for its unexpectedness. It is hard to define&#xD;
a mental sensation of any kind, but it is es-&#xD;
pecially hard to define the effect which beau-&#xD;
ty produces on the soul of its worshiper, on&#xD;
the temperament that is keenly alive to its&#xD;
influence. He started and stopped for a mo-&#xD;
ment, then came forward quickly. Hearing&#xD;
the ring of his tread on the gravel path, Nina&#xD;
turned toward him and they faced each other.&#xD;
"I am glad to find you," he said, ab-&#xD;
ruptly. "When I caught a glimpse of yo~r&#xD;
dress a few minutes ago, I was thinking 9f&#xD;
going to the house in search of you. But&#xD;
this is better."&#xD;
"You can have nothing to say to we,"&#xD;
said Nina, coldly. "Why should you have&#xD;
gone to the house in search of me? But I&#xD;
have something to say to you," she went on,&#xD;
catching her breath quickly, and looking at&#xD;
&#xD;
him with level, defiant eyes. "That is why&#xD;
I came into the garden. Ralph has just told&#xD;
me that you have promised to stay at Wy.&#xD;
verne while we are gone, and to be here when&#xD;
we return. I have come to tell you that it is&#xD;
impossible-that I will not submit to any&#xD;
thing of the kind. Sooner than endure it, I&#xD;
will tell him every thin"'&#xD;
"He will not need to be told any thing,"&#xD;
said Martindale, quietly. He looked paler&#xD;
than usual, and there were certain stern-cut&#xD;
lines about hi~ mouth, tl~e full significance of&#xD;
which Nina had not yet learned to appreciate.&#xD;
"He will know every thing sooner and better&#xD;
than words can tell him-for I have come to&#xD;
tell you that this must end. You must leave&#xD;
Wyverne with me to-night, Nina."&#xD;
"Leave Wyverne with you to-night!" re-&#xD;
peated Nina. For a minute she could say no&#xD;
more. His cool assumption of a proprietor-&#xD;
ship which she had repeatedly disowned, ab-&#xD;
solutely stunned her. She felt outraged and&#xD;
indignant even while she was conscious of a&#xD;
horrible sense of impotence. What could she&#xD;
do against a man with whom words went lit-&#xD;
erally for naught? Her own folly had placed&#xD;
her in his power, and, although she had for a&#xD;
time defied its exercise, she has of late been&#xD;
aware of a growing fear of Martindale. Rea-&#xD;
son told her that it was impossible for him&#xD;
to compel her to any thing; but instinct-&#xD;
sometimes the wisest as well as sometimes&#xD;
~the foolishest of guides-warned her that he&#xD;
would probably end by compelling her to all&#xD;
that lie desired.&#xD;
"What do you mean by speaking to me&#xD;
in this manner!" she said, flushing angrily.&#xD;
"How often must I tell you that I mean to&#xD;
keep my faith with Ralph at any cost? How&#xD;
often must I repeat that I will not be so un-&#xD;
grateful as to leave those who have done&#xD;
every thing for me, for you who have done&#xD;
nothing save poison my life with discontent,&#xD;
and make me wretched? But it is useless to&#xD;
go over this," she said, quivering with excite.&#xD;
ment. "In three days I shall be married,&#xD;
and it will be at an end. All that I came to&#xD;
say is-you must go away from Wyverne!"&#xD;
"I shall go when you are ready to go with&#xD;
me," he answered. His tone would have in-&#xD;
dicated to duller ears than those of the girl&#xD;
who listened, that the struggle between them&#xD;
had reached its supreme issue. His face hard-&#xD;
ened in resolution as she looked, but his&#xD;
eyes were full of passionate light. "Have&#xD;
&#xD;
you learned yet that there is no power short&#xD;
of death which can make me leave you?" he&#xD;
said. "Nina, have you not yet appreciated&#xD;
the utter folly of all this? You are mine! I&#xD;
will keep you at any cost. It is for you to&#xD;
decide what that cost shall be."&#xD;
"My experience of men is limited," said&#xD;
Nina, exasperated beyond all power of for-&#xD;
bearance, "but I have never known or heard&#xD;
of a man who found it so difficult to under-&#xD;
stand a plain and decided refusal as you seem&#xD;
to do."&#xD;
"Perhaps you have never known or heard&#xD;
of a man who himself refused so decidedly to&#xD;
be made the plaything of feminine caprice,"&#xD;
said Martindale. There was no indication of&#xD;
ruffled temper in his tone, though she saw a&#xD;
quick flash in the brown eyes. "But this is&#xD;
sheer waste of time," he went on, "and&#xD;
every minute is precious.' Nina, I can make&#xD;
arrangements for our departure to-night, if&#xD;
you will consent to come with me. Once for&#xD;
all, will you do it?"&#xD;
"Once for all - no!" answered Nina.&#xD;
She uttered the last word with an emphasis&#xD;
that startled a bird in the top of the arbor.&#xD;
It flew upward with a shrill cry that in turn&#xD;
startled her. To her overwrought fancy, it&#xD;
sounded like a note of warning.&#xD;
"No!" repeated Martindale. He took&#xD;
her hands almost violently into his own.&#xD;
"Nina, do you mean it?" he said, hoarsely.&#xD;
"Do you understand what it implies? Do&#xD;
you know that you will drive me to do any&#xD;
tking to break off this accursed marriage?&#xD;
For you love me - you cannot deny that.&#xD;
Neither can you deny that you long for the&#xD;
world which I offer and can give you. Nina,&#xD;
if you are wise, you will come with me now-&#xD;
at once!"&#xD;
"If you were generous, you would go&#xD;
away and leave me," said Nina, with a gasp.&#xD;
She was touched and torn by his vehemence,&#xD;
by his pale, passionate, pleading face. But&#xD;
she stood firm. There was something more&#xD;
than ordinary in the girl, after all. She was&#xD;
more nearly in love with Martindale at that me-&#xD;
ment than she had ever been before, and a great&#xD;
wave ofyea~in~for freedom and pleasure, the&#xD;
sweets of life an~ the gifts of love, seemed to&#xD;
rush over her. But she thought of Ralph, of&#xD;
those who, as she said, had "done every&#xD;
thing" for her; and her whole nature rose&#xD;
up in rebellion against the treachery of Ieav~.&#xD;

cannot 1 Oh, why did you come? Why dli&#xD;
you not go away long ago? Why do you no,&#xD;
leave me in peace? I must, I will, marr~&#xD;
Ralph?"&#xD;
"You will never marry Ralph I" said he&#xD;
"Nina, I tell you again that, if you are wise&#xD;
you will come With me to-night. You thiul&#xD;
that you will work harm to Ralph Wyvern(&#xD;
by going; believe me, you may work wors&#xD;
harm to him by staying."&#xD;
"How can I work harm to him by stay.&#xD;
ing?" she asked, glancing up quickly. Some&#xD;
thing in his tone-a menacing accent hard to&#xD;
be described- thrilled her with a sudden,&#xD;
vague fear. She felt herself shiver from head&#xD;
to foot in the warm, summer dusk. The sus-&#xD;
picion which had rushed upon her, without&#xD;
any apparent cause a little while before, came&#xD;
back now. What did Martindale intend to&#xD;
imply? How could she work harm to Ralph&#xD;
by staying?&#xD;
"What do you mean?" she asked, shrink-&#xD;
ing back a little. "You must be more ex-&#xD;
plicit if you wish me to understand you. How&#xD;
can I work harm to Ralph by staying?"&#xD;
"You will make his life miserable," said&#xD;
Martindale. "The stuff of which tame, house-&#xD;
hold martyrs are made, is not in you, Nina.&#xD;
That fiery soul of yours will pinelike a caged&#xD;
eagle when you are once Ralph Wyverne's&#xD;
wife~ You must come with me. For God's&#xD;
sake, end this miserable trifling, and say that&#xD;
you will do so! Nina, you mint come! There&#xD;
is no time to lose. We must leave here to-&#xD;
night.' To-morrow you will be my wife, and,&#xD;
before the week is out, we shall have sailed&#xD;
for Europe."&#xD;
"No" said Nina. It was her one sheet.&#xD;
anchor-this monosyllable-and she clung to&#xD;
it as a drowning man clings to the spar that&#xD;
may be his salvation. "No-I cannot?'~&#xD;
"Do you mean that you will not?" he&#xD;
asked. He dropped her bands as he spoke,&#xD;
and recoiled a step, looking at her with&#xD;
burning, passionate eyes, and pale, set face.&#xD;
"Nina-stop and think! Do you mean that&#xD;
you will net?"&#xD;
"Yes, I mean that," she answered. This&#xD;
last struggle was harder thai she had thought&#xD;
that it would be-this last pang was sharper&#xD;
than she had counted upon-but she felt that,&#xD;
at any cost, "every thing" must be ended.&#xD;
At any cost, Martindalo must learn that his&#xD;
further presence at Wyverne was useless. So&#xD;
ahe threw back her graceful head haughtily.&#xD;
&#xD;
I, "have you at last begun to realize that 1&#xD;
mean it?" she asked. "Do you at last un-&#xD;
derstand that I have never intended to marry&#xD;
you? and that I have always intended to&#xD;
- marry Ralph?"&#xD;
There was a tone of almost insolent defi.&#xD;
ance in these words, which, if she had be~n~&#xD;
wise, would have been the very last she would&#xD;
have adopted-a tone calculated to sting&#xD;
Martindale's sensitive pride like the touch of&#xD;
- a whip. It's effect was perceptible in a mo-&#xD;
- ment, even through his proof-armor of trained&#xD;
self-command. A dark-red flush surged over&#xD;
his face, then retreated as quickly. A gleam&#xD;
of dangerous fire came into his eyes, which&#xD;
* did not retreat, and his lips set themselves'&#xD;
quickly and sternly under the brown mus-&#xD;
tache. For a minute he did not answer; but&#xD;
Nina-who had by this time learned to know&#xD;
something of the weather-signs of his face-&#xD;
shrank a little. If she feared violence, she&#xD;
was reassured, however, by the quietness of&#xD;
the tone in which he spoke.&#xD;
"Yes, I understand you at last," he said.&#xD;
"Perhaps, indeed, I have understood you all&#xD;
the time better than you think. That you&#xD;
have not at all understood me is, no doubt, a&#xD;
matter of much less importance. I have al-&#xD;
ways thought," he went on, with a short&#xD;
laugh, "that the man who allows a woman to&#xD;
play fast-and-loose with him deserves all that&#xD;
falls to his share in the way of suffering and&#xD;
mortification. Your candor teaches me that&#xD;
I am quite right. Whoever has incurred con-&#xD;
tempt cannot be surprised that it is bestowed&#xD;
upon him. Whoever suffers himself to be&#xD;
made the toy of a woman must expect to re-&#xD;
ceive her ~ There are some toys that, in&#xD;
unskillful hands, prove dangerous, however.&#xD;
It is always well to remember that."&#xD;
"I did not mean-" Nina began; but he&#xD;
interrupted her imperiously, seizing her hands&#xD;
again as one who claims what is his by right.&#xD;
"You must mean one thing, or else noth-&#xD;
ing!" he said. "For the last time, Nina,&#xD;
will you come with inc to-night?"&#xD;
"For the last time-no!" answered Nina.&#xD;
,The word rang out clearly on the dewy, fragrant&#xD;
stillness. By a supreme effort, she wrenched&#xD;
her hands out of his clasp, and turned from&#xD;
him. There was a spell in his face against&#xD;
which she could not harden her heart. "How&#xD;
often must I repeat it?" she demanded, bit-&#xD;
terly. "How often must I say 'No!&#xD;
"You need not say it again," Martindale's&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
WHEn Nina entered the dining-room an&#xD;
hour later, she found that tea was over. The&#xD;
polished table still stood in the centre of the&#xD;
floor, glittering with its silver service and&#xD;
old-fashioned cut-glass dishes; but nobody&#xD;
was visible save Price, who was meditatively&#xD;
folding a napkin, when she stepped through&#xD;
one of the long French windows into the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"Has everybody finished supper?" she&#xD;
asked, coming forward, looking so much like&#xD;
a pale wraith of herself, as the lamplight fell&#xD;
over her, that even Price noticed it, when he&#xD;
started and turned.&#xD;
"Yes'm-they's all done," be answered.&#xD;
"Mistis told me to keep the table standing'&#xD;
till you come in, but I'm afraid tJ~e coffee's&#xD;
cold, Miss Nina."&#xD;
"I think I will take some tea," mid Nina,&#xD;
sitting down in the first seat to which she&#xD;
came.&#xD;
She disliked tea, as a general rule; but&#xD;
she remembered to have heard that it is a&#xD;
quicker stimulant than coffee, and she felt,&#xD;
just then, as if she needed a stimulant-the&#xD;
quicker the better.&#xD;
Price was a little surprised, but he was a&#xD;
servant of the old school, and consequently&#xD;
too well bred to say anything. He poured&#xD;
out the tea-which was strong enough to&#xD;
satisfy the most dissipated of drinkers-and&#xD;
carried it to Nina in a goblet half filled with&#xD;
ice, jingling pleasantly. It looked pretty, but&#xD;
Price, who held the fragrant Chinese herb In&#xD;
low esteem, knew that it did not taste well,&#xD;
and he expected an immediate demand for a&#xD;
cup of coffee. Instead of this, however, his&#xD;
capricious young mistress drained the glass,&#xD;
set it down with a grimace, and rose to her&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
"Ain't you goin' to take something' to eat,&#xD;
Miss Nina?" said Price, astonished and really&#xD;
concerned at her appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
She shook her head.&#xD;
"Not any thing," she answered. "I am&#xD;
not hungry."&#xD;
She did not even give a glance at the&#xD;
tempting array of dainty dishes as she turned&#xD;
across the hall. Then he looked at the empty&#xD;
goblet, and shook hie head.&#xD;
"There's something' wrong," said he, philo-&#xD;
sophically. "A woman with as good a appe-&#xD;
tite as Miss Nina ain't a.goin' to take nothing'&#xD;
but a little tea all of a sudden-an' look 'like&#xD;
death besides-without some good reason.&#xD;
I'm thinking' we're more likely t~ have a spell&#xD;
o' sickness than a wedding' here ~hortly."&#xD;
Meanwhile, Nina entered the drawing-&#xD;
room, where she found Mr. and Mrs. Wyverne&#xD;
and Ralph-the two former playing cards, of&#xD;
which Mr. Wyverne was inconveniently fond,&#xD;
the latter yawning and looking bored over a&#xD;
newspaper. At sight of his betrothed, his&#xD;
face brightened, however, and the uninterest-.&#xD;
ing sheet was tossed aside.&#xD;
"Where have you been, Nina?" he de-&#xD;
manded at once. "I was setting out in&#xD;
search of you a little while ago, but Martin.&#xD;
dale said he left you in the garden just before&#xD;
tea, so I thought you would come in when&#xD;
you felt lIke it. What kept you so late?"&#xD;
"Nothing in particular," answered Nina.&#xD;
"It was cool and pleasant out there, and I&#xD;
did not care for tea."&#xD;
"I am afraid you are not well," said&#xD;
Ralph, getting up and coming forward; he&#xD;
was struck, as Price had been, by her changed&#xD;
appearance. "Let me look at you in the&#xD;
light. Why, how pale you are! Nina, some-&#xD;
thing is certainly the matter. Are you sick?"&#xD;
"Nothing is the matter," said Nina. 'She&#xD;
was provoked with herself for being pale, and&#xD;
provoked with Ralph for noticing it. "One&#xD;
cannot help one's looks, or account for'them 1"&#xD;
Then, impatiently: "How warm it is in here!&#xD;
This room is intolerable with its glare of ll~ht.&#xD;
Let us go out on the terrace."&#xD;
Out on the terrace they went accordingly,&#xD;
A faint, indefinite light was shinin~ from a&#xD;
lovely young moon hanging in the western&#xD;
half of the sky. Nina looked more like a&#xD;
a spirit than a woman, Ralph. thought, in this&#xD;
vague lustre, with her misty-white dress, out&#xD;
of which the dew-damp had taken all stiff-&#xD;
ness, clinging abput her. Something in her&#xD;
appearance reminded him of the night when&#xD;

she had risen from the laboratory steps tc&#xD;
meet Martindale and himself, and they ha~&#xD;
likened her to a fairy; yet he felt instinctive&#xD;
ly that the difference was greater than th&#xD;
similarity.&#xD;
birznaayn:gnt-4n:s night a month ago, wai&#xD;
it not? Somehow you put me in mind of ii&#xD;
as you stand there now. Do you remember&#xD;
how Nartindale and I met you at the labora-&#xD;
tory, and how we told you that you looked&#xD;
like a fairy? Tonight you look like a spirit,"&#xD;
"Why do you speak of that?" said Nina.&#xD;
He was not prepared for the shrinking start&#xD;
which she gave. "Why do you remind me&#xD;
of it? WI*s it a month ago tonight? I had&#xD;
not thought of it. How strange that it should&#xD;
be! Ralph "-she turned to him abruptly.-&#xD;
"do you believe in presentiments? Of course&#xD;
you do not, however; nobody ever does until&#xD;
they have felt them. But do you remember&#xD;
how I begged youa month ago this night not&#xD;
to keep that man here or trust to his experi-&#xD;
ments? 0 Ralph, if you had only heeded&#xD;
mel"&#xD;
"Why should I have heeded you?" said&#xD;
Ralph. Bvcn the passionate vibration in her&#xD;
tone did not rouse his dull suspicion. On the&#xD;
contrary, he conceived it to be only a fresh&#xD;
proof of the prejudice which is inherent in&#xD;
the feminine nature; and he felt inclined to&#xD;
indulge in a little masculine triumph over it.&#xD;
"As far as my experiments are concerned,&#xD;
it is a very good thing that I did not heed&#xD;
you," he went on, with such a glow of self.&#xD;
satisfaction in his tone that Nina was half&#xD;
prepared for what was coming. "You may&#xD;
take sufficient interest in them to be glad to&#xD;
J.ear that Martindale told me, only a little while&#xD;
ago, that he at last sees his way to a success-&#xD;
Fnl result; in fact, that it may be said to be&#xD;
accomplished. He would tell me nothing un-&#xD;
til he was certain, he said, although he had&#xD;
fancied as much for some time."&#xD;
"When did he tell you this?" asked&#xD;
Nina, stopping short in her walk,&#xD;
"Only a little while ago-when he came&#xD;
in to tea," Ralph answered. "It was quite a&#xD;
surprise to me, and really I scarcely know&#xD;
how to be grateful enough to him. His ap.&#xD;
plication has certainly been wonderful, and&#xD;
to-night he has returned to the laboratory to&#xD;
make some final tests, which I am to go down&#xD;
and see a little later."&#xD;
"To go down and see 1" repeated Nina.&#xD;
&#xD;

TENEMENTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
She could say nothing more. Her whole at-&#xD;
I tension became concentrated on her own&#xD;
- mind. Was she mad or sane in the horrible&#xD;
fear that came to her as Ralph uttered those&#xD;
words? Was she distraught with the idle&#xD;
appreciate-as if illumined by a flash of light&#xD;
-the full meaning of some words Martindale&#xD;
had spoken to her but a few short hours be-&#xD;
fore?&#xD;
"Yes, to go down and see I" said&#xD;
Ralph, triumphantly. "Seeing is believing,&#xD;
you know I I wish you would let this be a&#xD;
lesson to you about the folly of prejudice,&#xD;
Ninetta," he went on, feeling it incumbent&#xD;
upon him to point the occasion with a moral.&#xD;
"If I had been uncivil and ungrateful enough&#xD;
to send Martindale away, as you requested, I&#xD;
should never have had the great pleasure of&#xD;
seeing my idea brought to a practical and sue-&#xD;
cessful issue."&#xD;
"Do you think you will see it now?"&#xD;
said Nina. She was sorry for the words after&#xD;
she had uttered them. Ralph would only&#xD;
think her more prejudiced; she would only&#xD;
lessen her power of influencing him.&#xD;
"1 cannot doubt Martindale's word," he&#xD;
answered, gravely; "and I certainly should&#xD;
not think of doubting his judgment. His as-&#xD;
surance wa's positive with regard to the suc-&#xD;
cessful result of the experiments. But when&#xD;
I come back from the laboratory, I shall be&#xD;
able to tell you more positively," he added,&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"When are you to go?" she asked.-&#xD;
Som'ething strange and cold in her tone struck&#xD;
Ralph. He was surprised and pained. It is&#xD;
always hard to realize that our pleasure gives&#xD;
no pleasure to those whom we love.&#xD;
"Martindale said about ten o'clock," he&#xD;
answered. "I suppose jt is after nine now-&#xD;
these summer nights are so short! I wanted&#xD;
to go at once, but he said he preferred to bp&#xD;
alone while he made one or two final expe$-&#xD;
ments; and I did not press the point."&#xD;
"About ten o'clock I" repeated Nin~z.&#xD;
She put her hand to her head. Her brain&#xD;
felt in a whirl. She could scarcely have given&#xD;
a definite expression to the fears and suspi-&#xD;
cions that thronged upon her. One thing&#xD;
only was clear and unmistakable - doubt I&#xD;
Doubt of Martindale, and doubt of his ex-&#xD;
periments I "There is no truth in him!"&#xD;
she said to herself; and those words which&#xD;
he had unintentionally let fall in the midst of&#xD;
&#xD;
his passion in the garden, came back to her&#xD;
with grim, warning significance: "You think&#xD;
you will work harm to Ralph Wyverne by go-&#xD;
ing: believe me, you may work worse harm&#xD;
to him by staying!"&#xD;
* "Why, you are resolving into an echo,"&#xD;
said Ralph, smiling. "Is not ten o'clock as&#xD;
good an hour as any other?" Then he took&#xD;
her hand and drew it into his arm. " Dear,~~&#xD;
he said, a little wistfully, "have you no word&#xD;
of sympathy or congratulation for me? I&#xD;
know you don't like chemistry, but still-"&#xD;
"I do like it!" said Nina, with a short,&#xD;
dry sob. "I like every thing that you like,&#xD;
Ralph! I am sorry that I have not given&#xD;
you more s~mnpathy and encouragement, but I&#xD;
have been so selfish that I have thought only&#xD;
of~myself. What a terrible thing it is to&#xD;
think of one's self!" she cried, passionate-&#xD;
ly. "What misery it works on everybody I&#xD;
Ralph I "-to his surprise she threw her arms&#xD;
around and clung to him-" can you forgive&#xD;
me? I-oh, I am very sorry!"&#xD;
"Forgive you, my darling!" said Ralph;&#xD;
"what on earth have I to forgive you for?"&#xD;
Well as he knew the impulses-now~ passion-&#xD;
ate, now tender-of this wayward girl, he did&#xD;
not understand her at present. "I hope we&#xD;
shall do better after we are married," he said,&#xD;
cheerfully. "You will take some interest in&#xD;
chemistry then, and we shall settle into a&#xD;
scientific Darby and Joan. But you must not&#xD;
excite yourself like this, Why, your hands&#xD;
are burning, and yet you are shivering! Nina,&#xD;
you certainly are not well. You must have&#xD;
been in the dew too long this evening. Don't&#xD;
stay out any longer, dear! Go to bed, and&#xD;
to-morrow I will tell you all about the experi-&#xD;
ments."&#xD;
"I am not sleepy or sick," said Nina.&#xD;
"Why should I go to bed? Ralph, will you&#xD;
do something for me, or, rather, will you let&#xD;
me do something?" she went on, eagerly. "I&#xD;
always said that I was another Fatima, you&#xD;
know; that if I had married Bluebeard I&#xD;
should certainly have opened the closet; so&#xD;
nobody need ever be surprised at my curiosity.&#xD;
Jnst now I have a fancy to see the result of&#xD;
Mr. Martindale's experiments~ before you do.&#xD;
Won't you be obliging, and let me go down&#xD;
to the laboratory in your place at ten o'clock."&#xD;
"I will let you go down wit/s me," said&#xD;
Ralph, smiling; "won't that do as well?&#xD;
We shall both see the result together, then,&#xD;
and I can explain-"&#xD;
&#xD;
But Nina shook her head, interrupting&#xD;
him impatiently.&#xD;
"That is not what I want!" she said. "I&#xD;
want the gratification of seeing it first. You&#xD;
don't understand how I feel about it. It is&#xD;
childish, I dare say, but you ought to have&#xD;
learned by this time how much of the child&#xD;
there is still in me."&#xD;
"I hope there always will be," said Ralph.&#xD;
He was snificiently in love to find it very&#xD;
pleasant to humor this pretty, capricious ty-&#xD;
rant. "Of course, you can go if you like,"&#xD;
he said. "I'll stay here or in the drawing-&#xD;
room, until you come back." He took out&#xD;
his watch and glanced at it in the faint moon-&#xD;
light. "It wants a few minutes of ten now,"&#xD;
he said.&#xD;
"Then I will go," said Nina. She was as-&#xD;
tonished at the feeling that came over her as&#xD;
she uttered those simple words. It was the&#xD;
strange, subtle sensation of one who is con-&#xD;
scious of having taken an irrevocable step-&#xD;
such a sensation as comes to all save the&#xD;
most obtuse at certain important and critical&#xD;
moments of life, when our own words or our&#xD;
own acts erect a barrier between the past&#xD;
and the future which no after-effort can re-&#xD;
move. It was under the influence of this&#xD;
feeling that she turned suddenly to Ralph&#xD;
"Don't think hardly of me, dear," she said.&#xD;
"I don't mean to distress or pain you! I&#xD;
love you better than anybody else in the&#xD;
world, and I would do any thing to serve you,&#xD;
any thing to-to atone for my folly and self-&#xD;
ishness I But there may be only one way.&#xD;
Don't blame me if I take that."&#xD;
"Nina, what are you talking about?"&#xD;
said Ralph. He did not understand the drift&#xD;
or meaning of her words at all. She only&#xD;
confused and puzzled him by these chameleon&#xD;
changes of mood. "I am not likely to blame&#xD;
you for any thing unless you make yourself&#xD;
sick. I think you must have a fever. I&#xD;
told you some time ago that it would be bet-&#xD;
ter for you to go to bed than to stay out in&#xD;
this siight-air. I am not sure that there is&#xD;
not some malaria lurking in it."&#xD;
"It does not matter if there is," said&#xD;
Nina, with a faint smile. "Good-uiight."&#xD;
"Of course, you'll find me here when you&#xD;
come back from the laboratory,~~ said he,&#xD;
rather surprised at the quick, passionate kiss&#xD;
she gave him.&#xD;
"Shall I?" she said, rather absently, and,&#xD;
turning away, went down the terrace-steps.&#xD;

NINA'S ATONEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ralph stood at the head of them, watching&#xD;
the slender, white-clad figure, as it walked&#xD;
slowly along the garden-path below. Even&#xD;
through his obtuseness, a sudden chill of un.&#xD;
easy foreboding struck, when it vanished.&#xD;
"By Jove, this doesn't seem exactly the right&#xD;
kind of thing!" he said, half aloud. "Per-&#xD;
haps I had better follow her, after all." He&#xD;
laughed the next minute, however, and, taking&#xD;
a cigar from his pocket, struck a match and&#xD;
lighted it. "Am I getting nervous, too I'"&#xD;
he said. "Nina must have infected me. It&#xD;
would be a shabby kind of trick to follow her&#xD;
when she was so anxious to see the experi-&#xD;
ments first. Poor little darling! "-he laughed&#xD;
again-" she won't understand much about&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Then he put his hands in his coat-pockets,&#xD;
and, with his cigar in his mouth, began to&#xD;
pace to and fro along the terrace It was&#xD;
harder on him-this waiting to see the result&#xD;
of his long-cherished idea-than any onewould&#xD;
have imagined from the quietness with which&#xD;
he bore it. But, in little or in great, Ralph&#xD;
had never hesitated over a sacrifice for Nina.&#xD;
He would not have hesitated over the greatest&#xD;
of all sacrifices, if he had once suspected that&#xD;
it was needed. It was merely a caprice, he&#xD;
thought-this fancy to go down to the labo-&#xD;
~atory-but it afforded him real and sensible&#xD;
pleasure to deny himself in order to gratify&#xD;
it. Pacing there in the faint, level moonlight,&#xD;
he thought moreof her than of his chemistry.&#xD;
The spirit of her last, self-reproachful words&#xD;
seemed to come back to him. "My darling!"&#xD;
he said, with a sudden rush of passionate ten-&#xD;
derness. He longed to take her into his arms,&#xD;
and answer her with loving words, as he had&#xD;
not answered her when she had spoken.&#xD;
After a while, the consciousness came to&#xD;
him that she had been gone some time. He&#xD;
looked at his watch. The hands pointed to&#xD;
half-past ten. He began to feel impatient,&#xD;
and to wonder what she had found so inter-&#xD;
esting in the experiments. One or two more&#xD;
turns along the terrace - then restlessness&#xD;
prevailed, and he walked toward the steps.&#xD;
As he approached, a dark figure emerged&#xD;
from one of the garden-paths, and quickly&#xD;
ascended them. The moon sunk below the&#xD;
horizon at that moment, but the stars gave&#xD;
light enough for Ralph to recognize Martin.&#xD;
dale.&#xD;
As Nina hastened through the garden to&#xD;
&#xD;
the laboratory, her thoughts began to clear,&#xD;
her instinct to resolve itself into certainty.&#xD;
Now that she was alone, she did not hesitate&#xD;
to face the indefinite fear which she had&#xD;
thrust froni her when Ralph was by, at which&#xD;
she had scarcely dared to look, lest horror&#xD;
should overpower judgment, and lead to harm&#xD;
instead of good. Even yet her idea of wl&amp;amp;at&#xD;
she feared was of necessity vague; but there&#xD;
are some things that gain rather than lose&#xD;
terror by vagueness, and this was one of'them.&#xD;
Facing it, as she did, with a bravery that sur-&#xD;
prised herself, one grim certainty stood out&#xD;
darkly and clearly through all the mystery-&#xD;
the certainty that Martindale's invitation to&#xD;
Ralph meant that which is best expressed in&#xD;
two short but significant words-foul play!&#xD;
Foul play of what kind, or to be accomplished&#xD;
in what manner, Nina did not know. She was&#xD;
only conscious in every fibre of the warning&#xD;
which Nature sometimes gives in, times of&#xD;
danger; she only knew that all which she had&#xD;
felt in the afternoon rushed back on her&#xD;
now, intensified~ a hundred-fold. Of course,&#xD;
her interview with Martindale had much to&#xD;
do with this. She could not forget his reek.&#xD;
less passion, nor his almost menacing deter-&#xD;
mination. She could still less forget his look&#xD;
and tone when he warned her that she might&#xD;
"work harm" to Ralph by staying, nor fail&#xD;
to connect them with the false pretext by&#xD;
which he strove to draw the latter to the&#xD;
laboratory.&#xD;
If it be asked how she knew that it was a&#xD;
false pretext, it can only be answered that&#xD;
she knew it as she had known from the first&#xD;
that Ralph's idea was wholly impracticable,&#xD;
and that Martindale had made of the amateur&#xD;
chemist's hopes and expectations mere tools&#xD;
to serve his own interest. That much, sa-&#xD;
gaeity or instinct had told her a month be-&#xD;
fore. The deception of to-night, thei-efore,&#xD;
was a sufficiently plain sequence. As for the&#xD;
sinister motive which was supposed to lurk&#xD;
behind this deception, it can at least be said&#xD;
for her that she had no inconsiderable foun-&#xD;
dation on which to build suspicion. in these&#xD;
two weeks of struggle, she had learned some-&#xD;
thing of the man with whom she had so un-&#xD;
successfully " amused herself;" she had gained&#xD;
an idea, at least, of how little he was likely&#xD;
to halt at half measures, or to heed any ob-&#xD;
stacle in the path of his desire.&#xD;
Feeling oil this, her first instinctive im-&#xD;
pulse had been to keep Ralph from the lab-&#xD;
&#xD;
oratory and the danger which might be await-&#xD;
ing him there. But, having gained this point,&#xD;
her next step was by no means elear~ What&#xD;
she was to do apart from the one important&#xD;
Item of gaining time, and judgment for her-&#xD;
self of Martindale's mood and intention, she&#xD;
did not know. Certainly the prospect was&#xD;
not encouraging. She knew that all hope of&#xD;
influencing him by entreaty or defiance was&#xD;
useless. She had tested both too often not&#xD;
to be assured of that. But, if the worst came&#xD;
to the worst, she held one trump-card which&#xD;
she had girded up her strength to play. If&#xD;
it were a question of risking Ralph's life, or&#xD;
of eloping with Martindale, she meant to&#xD;
elope with the latter. That was what the&#xD;
last passionate words which had puzzled Wy-&#xD;
verne had meant. In truth, a reckless yet&#xD;
awful sense of powerlessness had come over&#xD;
the girl. Why should she struggle any longer&#xD;
against the fate which she had brought on&#xD;
herself? Why should she endeavor to resist&#xD;
the man who let no barrier stand before his&#xD;
impetuous purpose? "It is my own fault,"&#xD;
she murmured; "I loosed the dam-I have&#xD;
no right to complain that the torrent sweeps&#xD;
me away. But it must not harm Ralph!&#xD;
Whatever happens, Ralph must not be&#xD;
harmed!"&#xD;
When she came in sight of the pavilion,&#xD;
and saw a light burning through the small&#xD;
panes of its old-fashioned lattice, she paused&#xD;
and looked at her watch bithe faint lustre of&#xD;
the sinking moon. It was exactly ten o'clock.&#xD;
She was just in time; and yet-faee to face&#xD;
with what she had undertaken -her heart&#xD;
seemed to die away within her. She shrank&#xD;
with absolute terror from meeting Martindale.&#xD;
She felt impelled togo back and tell everything&#xD;
to Ralph. One consideration, however, was&#xD;
strong enough to deter her from this: if she&#xD;
were right in what she suspected, there would&#xD;
be no means of putting Ralph suffleicutly on&#xD;
his guard to avoid danger. "How can I tell&#xD;
in what shape it might come?" she thought.&#xD;
Martindale's intimate knowledge of chemistry&#xD;
seemed to endow him with strange and ter-&#xD;
rible power over human life. Apart from her&#xD;
vague and somewhat fantastic terrors, Nina&#xD;
knew that the mere elements of this science&#xD;
contain much which can be turned to fearful&#xD;
purpose by a keen brain and an unscrupulous&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
It was too late to turn back, therefore-&#xD;
too late in this, as in every thing else! That&#xD;
&#xD;
was what she thought, as she went on slowly&#xD;
-along the dewy paths, past the clinging&#xD;
roses and a great bed of lilies that filled the&#xD;
summer night with fragrance - until she&#xD;
gained the pavilion steps. There she paused&#xD;
again. Her heart was beating as if it would&#xD;
suffocate her; her hands were burning, yet&#xD;
she felt herself shiver from head to foot.&#xD;
What was the meaning of it? "Am I going&#xD;
to be ill?" she thought, pressing her hands&#xD;
to her temples. She did not know that the&#xD;
nervous tension and excitement of weeks had&#xD;
reached its supreme height in the stormy&#xD;
scene of the afternoon, and the terror of the&#xD;
night. Standing there, she looked up at the&#xD;
great starry dome arching overhead; at the&#xD;
house with its gabled roof cutting sharply&#xD;
against the steel-blue sky; at the dark, silent&#xD;
garden, with its wealth of unseen perfume.&#xD;
Familiar as the whole scene was, she felt as&#xD;
if she were looking at it from the farther side&#xD;
of a great gulf; as if the ties which bound&#xD;
her to Wyverne were already severed. "Home&#xD;
of yours it will never be again!" a voice&#xD;
seemed to say. "As you have sowed, so must&#xD;
you reap! Go forth to the world for which&#xD;
you have longed, with a man for whom you&#xD;
have neither trust nor love!"&#xD;
After a while she remembered that every&#xD;
minute of time was precious, that Ralph&#xD;
would be impatient, that whatever was to be&#xD;
done must be done at once. Although the&#xD;
night was warm, the pavilion-door was closed.&#xD;
Forcing herself, by a strong effort, she laid&#xD;
her hand on the lock. It yielded readily to&#xD;
her touch, and, opening the door, she stepped&#xD;
within the laboratory.&#xD;
Her first sensation was one of surprise;&#xD;
her next, of inexpressible relief. Martin-&#xD;
dale was not there. Her glance swept round&#xD;
the laboratory in a second, and took in ~the&#xD;
fact. There was every sign of his recent&#xD;
presence, however. A lamp was burning on&#xD;
a table covered with chemical apparatus-&#xD;
retorts, tubes, receivers, a host, of things of&#xD;
which she did not even know the names.&#xD;
Having closed the door, 'Nina paused and&#xD;
looked at them-looked with surprise and&#xD;
doubt. Were those prepared for flalph's ex-&#xD;
periments ? After all, had she suspected&#xD;
Martindale unjustly? Or - or was there a&#xD;
trap under all this specious and fair-seeming&#xD;
arrangement? It was significant of the dis-&#xD;
trust with which her mind was filled, that&#xD;
she should have asked this question, for cer-&#xD;

&#xD;
thinly it would never have occurred to any&#xD;
one who entered the laboratory without preju-&#xD;
dice, or suspicion of foul play.&#xD;
Despite the apparent want of any thing to&#xD;
justify her high-wrought fears, the obstinate&#xD;
sense of danger still remained with Nina.&#xD;
She had scarcely closed the door, before a&#xD;
sudden sense of faintness came over her. It&#xD;
was a difi~rent sensation from that which she&#xD;
had felt outside; but she took it to be an ef-&#xD;
feet from the same cause, and, although it&#xD;
did not rouse any fear for herself, it quickened&#xD;
her misgivings for Ralph. "I am going to&#xD;
be ill," she thought, "but I must see-I&#xD;
must know-what this means. There&#xD;
something wrong. The very silence seems&#xD;
sinister!"&#xD;
It truly did. If the speaker had known&#xD;
any thing of the menacing quiet which pre.&#xD;
cedes a gunpowder explosion, she might have&#xD;
likened the stillness to that-it seemed so&#xD;
ominous of evil. The air was full of an in.&#xD;
definable oppression, which made her gasp&#xD;
for breath as she crossed the floor to the&#xD;
table, and began to scan the apparatus -~&#xD;
searching, she scarcely knew for what. This,&#xD;
however, was only the work of a moment.&#xD;
Before the second-hand of her watch could&#xD;
have made a quarter of its circuit, a more&#xD;
deadly and unutterable faintness than any&#xD;
she had felt before, rushed over her Her&#xD;
head began to swim, a mist rose before her&#xD;
eyes, the tubes and glass retorts were sud-&#xD;
denly blurred out. The awful oppression&#xD;
closed upon her. She made a wild struggle&#xD;
for breath: one hand went to her throat; the&#xD;
other grasped instinctively the corner of the&#xD;
table. Thus preserved from falling, she stood&#xD;
for an instant swaying like a reed, or rather&#xD;
like one around whom the black darkness of&#xD;
unconsciousness begins, to close. "Am I&#xD;
going to faint?" she thought. After all her&#xD;
suspicions, no glimpse of the horrible truth&#xD;
came to her when she was thus face to face&#xD;
with it. She turned with a vague idea of&#xD;
reaching and opening the nearest casement.&#xD;
Instinct told her that there was ~hlvation in&#xD;
the freSh air so carefully shut from the lab-&#xD;
oratory. But the poisonous fumes had done&#xD;
their work. Two-three-blind, faltering&#xD;
steps she made-&#xD;
Then came a heavy fall!&#xD;
"Ralph!" exclaimed Martindale, starting&#xD;
violently as he recognized the figure which&#xD;
&#xD;
met him in the starlight. "Ralph! Is it-is&#xD;
it possible this is you?"&#xD;
"Of course it is I," said Ralph. "Who&#xD;
else should it be? Arc you looking for me?&#xD;
I was just coming down to the laboratory."&#xD;
"Just coming down to the laboratory!"&#xD;
repeated the other. If the light had not been&#xD;
so dim, Ralph would have seen that he was&#xD;
white to the very lips. "I-I thought you&#xD;
had gone down," he said, after a minute.&#xD;
"You thought I had gone down 1" re-&#xD;
peated Ralph, in turn-not a little surprised.&#xD;
"Why, where did you come from? Have&#xD;
you not been at the laboratory yourself?"&#xD;
"Not-not for some time 1" answered&#xD;
Martindale, lifting his hand and loosening the&#xD;
tie of his cravat. "I finished some tests," he&#xD;
went on, "and walked out into the garden.&#xD;
I could not see the laboratory, but I-I was&#xD;
sure I heard the door open and shut a little&#xD;
while ago."&#xD;
"Tt is very probable you did,' said Ralph,&#xD;
carelessly. "Nina went down about half an&#xD;
hour since. But I don't at all understand!&#xD;
You told me that I should find you-"&#xD;
A grasp on his arm, the like of which he&#xD;
had never felt before, stopped the words on&#xD;
his lips. Even in the starlight he saw now&#xD;
the ghastly pallor of the face near his own;&#xD;
and the first sound of the voice, that had no&#xD;
cadence of its natural tone in it, startled hint&#xD;
beyond all measure.&#xD;
"Who did you say had gone there?" Mar-&#xD;
tindale demanded.&#xD;
"Nina," answered Ralph. He was filled&#xD;
with sudden, intangible alarm. "Good Heav-&#xD;
ens! Martindale, is-is any thing the mat-&#xD;
ter?"&#xD;
"Nina!" repeated Martindale-it was not&#xD;
a word, but a note qf horror, such as Wyverne&#xD;
never forgot-" Nh~a 1" He hurled the other&#xD;
from him. "Did you nsk what was the mat-&#xD;
ter?" he cried, half madly, half sternly. "You&#xD;
have sent her into a laboratoryfihledwith poison.&#xD;
ous gas!"&#xD;
"Martindale!" said Ralph. If the heav-&#xD;
ens had fallen upon him he could not have&#xD;
been more astounded; he could scarcely have&#xD;
understood less of what he heard. He was&#xD;
hardly eon~cious of the recoil from Martin-&#xD;
dale's grasp. The next moment, however, the&#xD;
latter had darted down the terrace-steps, and&#xD;
was speeding along the garden-path which&#xD;
led to the pavilion.&#xD;
Instantly Ralph followed. The meaning&#xD;
&#xD;
of those last, terrible words came to him now&#xD;
-at least their meaning with regard to Nina.&#xD;
Beyond that his mind did not go. It did not&#xD;
nnonr to him, at such a moment, to question&#xD;
why the laboratory had been full of poisonous&#xD;
gas. It was enough that she had entered such&#xD;
a place, and that ncr safety-her very life-&#xD;
was in horrible jeopardy.&#xD;
lt is unnecessary to say that no word was&#xD;
exchanged between the two breathless run-&#xD;
ners. Only the quick fall of their flying feet&#xD;
smote on the stillness of the starlit night&#xD;
until they gained the laboratory, where Mar.&#xD;
tindale-being in advance-dashed open the&#xD;
door and rushed in.&#xD;
He was only invisible a moment. By the&#xD;
time Ralph reached the steps he appeared&#xD;
again in the door-staggcring like a drunken&#xD;
man-but bearing Nina in his arms.&#xD;
"Give her to me!" said Wyverne, hoarse.&#xD;
ly. He took the slender form-heavy now&#xD;
with the leaden weight of inert matter-and&#xD;
laid it down on the very spot where she had&#xD;
stood so short a time before, taking her last&#xD;
look of the fair earth. She might bc only un-&#xD;
conscious-stupefied, narcotized-he thought;&#xD;
but hope died within him when he felt the&#xD;
brow, the lips, the wrist-lastly, the silent&#xD;
heart-without finding one token of respira-&#xD;
tion or throb of life.&#xD;
Yet, when Martindale brought the neces-&#xD;
sary chemical agents and means for restoring&#xD;
consciousness, he went eagerly to work with&#xD;
them. Application after application was&#xD;
made, test after test failed. It was a strange&#xD;
scene. The lamp, which had been brought&#xD;
from the laboratory, flung its vivid glow over&#xD;
the beautiful face set in the stillness of death;&#xD;
the quiet stars gazed down on the two men&#xD;
kneeling beside it in the vain attempt to re-&#xD;
store that which had fled forever. The most&#xD;
unscientific looker-on might have told them&#xD;
that all effort was hopeless, that no power of&#xD;
science could recall the spark of life to the&#xD;
fair clay it had animated; but still, with&#xD;
feverish, passionate energy they persevered,&#xD;
though no restorative brought any flush of&#xD;
life to the white skin, no sigh of returning&#xD;
vitality to the lips, no flutter to the fallen lids.&#xD;
This could not continue, however. After&#xD;
a while, the grim truth came home to them.&#xD;
They could no longer close their eyes to the&#xD;
fact that this which they were fighting was&#xD;
not unconsciousness, but death-death which&#xD;
holds as relentlessly its fairest as its meanest&#xD;
&#xD;
39&#xD;
&#xD;
prize. Their eyes met for a moment with the&#xD;
blankness of despair, At that instant, there&#xD;
was no other thought ia the mind of either.&#xD;
Martindale rose slowly-swayingly-to his&#xD;
feet. Ralph, still kneeling by the dead girl,&#xD;
looked up at him.&#xD;
"There is no hope!" he said,&#xD;
His voice was strangely quiet. In truth,&#xD;
the shook had been so great that, for the&#xD;
time, sensation was dead. An overmastering&#xD;
blow must always do one of two things-stun&#xD;
or craze. This had stunned him.&#xD;
"None!" Martindale answered. His tongue&#xD;
seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth; he&#xD;
could scarcely articulate. "I knew that when&#xD;
I found her," he said. "The gas in there"&#xD;
-he nodded toward the laboratory-" would&#xD;
have killed an army."&#xD;
"How did it come to be there?" asked&#xD;
Ralph.&#xD;
Even yet suspicion had not occurred to&#xD;
him. He scarcely remembered the words&#xD;
Martindale had spoken on the terrace. Every&#xD;
thing had merged for him in the horrible&#xD;
thought of Nina's danger.&#xD;
"Have you not guessed that?" asked the&#xD;
other. To him, also, a strange, stunned,&#xD;
reckless feeling came. Every thing had gone&#xD;
wrong. His great throw had brought ruin&#xD;
instead of fortune. Instead of his rival, it&#xD;
was the woman he loved who lay dead at his&#xD;
feet. "She suspected this, and came in your&#xD;
place," he said. "I generated the gas for&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
"For me?"&#xD;
For a minute Ralph could say no more&#xD;
than that. Then he sprung to his feet-pale,&#xD;
horror-stricken, yet terrible in the aspect that&#xD;
transformed his face, in the gleam that came&#xD;
into his eyes.&#xD;
"If you had not been blind, you might&#xD;
have seen long ago that I loved her-that I&#xD;
stayed here only to win her!" Martindale&#xD;
said, as they faced each other in the dim, un.&#xD;
certain light. "I swore to stop your mar-&#xD;
riage at any cost," he added, after a minute-&#xD;
a minute broken by no sound. "I have been&#xD;
as good as my word-I have stopped it, you&#xD;
see."&#xD;
"Are you mad?" said Ralph. His own&#xD;
mother could ~seareely have recognized the&#xD;
voice in which he spoke as his own. "Do&#xD;
you know that, if this is true, ~'ou will not live&#xD;
long enough to take her name on your lips&#xD;
again?"&#xD;

Martindale laughed-the faint, scornful Ralph made one quick, tiger-like spring&#xD;
sound breaking the silence with ghastly Big- forward, but he was too late. In the throat&#xD;
nificance. There was a glitter in his eye, as on which his fingers closed the death-rattle&#xD;
ominous as the lurid glow that had conic to had already sounded. With one mocking&#xD;
Ralph's.                                smile, the soul fled. To the baffled avenger&#xD;
"Do you think I will ask your leave when remained only that faint, subtle odor of bitter&#xD;
to die?" he demanded. Then he put his almonds which bctrays the swiftest and dead.&#xD;
hand to his lips.                       liest poison known to chemistry.&#xD;

HUGH'S VENDETTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"NTARGARET," said Hugh Churchill, as&#xD;
..LVJ.. he came abruptly into his sister's&#xD;
room one morning, "who do you suppose is&#xD;
dead?"&#xD;
The address was startling enough in it-&#xD;
self, but there was a suppressed excitement&#xD;
in the speaker's face, and a suppressed tone of&#xD;
awe in his voice, that made Margaret Churchill&#xD;
turn pale as she looked up from her sewing&#xD;
in quick alarm.&#xD;
"Indeed I cannot tell, Hugh," she said.&#xD;
"Not-not anybody I care about, surely?"&#xD;
"Care about!" repeated her brother.&#xD;
"Not unless you care about knowing that he&#xD;
has gone to his deserts in another and-a&#xD;
hotter world! That is all the concern I feel&#xD;
in Henry Tyrrell's death, I am sure."&#xD;
"Henry Tyrrell! Is he dead 1'."&#xD;
"He dropped down with a fit of apoplexy&#xD;
an hour ago."&#xD;
"Where?"&#xD;
"On the street. I was sitting in Morri-&#xD;
son's office about ten o'clock, and chanced to&#xD;
see him walk past, looking as usual; yet,&#xD;
scarcely five minutes later, a boy rushed in&#xD;
saying that Mr. Tyrrell had just fallen down&#xD;
dead. Of course, we ran out at once. He&#xD;
was not dead, however; so we carried him&#xD;
into the office, and sent for the doctors at&#xD;
once. They were all there in no time, but&#xD;
they could do nothing for him, and he has&#xD;
just died."&#xD;
His voice sank a little over the last words,&#xD;
* and a look of horror came into Margaret&#xD;
Churchill's face.&#xD;
"Died like that! 0 Hugh! how tern-&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
ble! Surely he said something-surely he&#xD;
made some reparation for such aii awful&#xD;
life!"&#xD;
11cr brother laughed, not mirthfully.&#xD;
"Do you believe in death-bed atoneinents,&#xD;
Madge? I confess I don't, and I doubt if&#xD;
Tyrrell did, either. He recovered his senses&#xD;
toward the last, but ho only uttered two&#xD;
names. The first was his son's-"&#xD;
"And the other?"&#xD;
The young man's voice deepened, and a&#xD;
change came over his face that hardened and&#xD;
altered it, as he answered gravely, almost&#xD;
sternly:&#xD;
"The other was-our father's I&#xD;
Margaret looked up, her awe-struck eyes&#xD;
meeting his, and for a moment neither spoke.&#xD;
At last it was the girl's voice that said:&#xD;
"God forgive him!"&#xD;
Low as the words were, they reached&#xD;
Hugh Churchill's ears, and brought a dark&#xD;
cloud over his face.&#xD;
"So that is your idea of Christianity, is&#xD;
it, Madge?" be asked, bitterly. "A nice&#xD;
place you and the like of you would make of&#xD;
heaven-ay, and of earth? too! if 1 believed&#xD;
that a, few prayers or good works at the&#xD;
eleventh hour could atone for Henry Tyrrell's&#xD;
half a century of wrong-doing, I would fling&#xD;
conscience to the winds, and live as he did-&#xD;
perhaps die as he died, too. But that would&#xD;
make no difference in your libertil creed. I&#xD;
don't pretend to decide whether or not such&#xD;
opinions are orthodox, but of all the texts in&#xD;
Holy Writ I like best the one which says that&#xD;
what a man sows the same shall he reap,&#xD;
here and hereafter."&#xD;
Margaret did not answer. Her thoughts,&#xD;

42             HUGH'S VENDETTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
in@ed, seemed to have wandered from her&#xD;
brother's speech, and gone back to what he&#xD;
had said before. At least, when he finished,&#xD;
she went on with the other train of thought.&#xD;
"And he spoke of papa. 0 Hugh! who&#xD;
can tell what he was thinking? I wonder&#xD;
was it the sight of you that brought back the&#xD;
past? Did he see you at all?"&#xD;
"He saw me as plainly as you see me&#xD;
now, ~ her brother answered. "Indeed, I&#xD;
doubt if he saw any one else. I was stand-&#xD;
ing at the foot of the bed, and, when he&#xD;
opened his eyes, they rested full on my face.&#xD;
And with such a look! Madge, it was awful!&#xD;
I don't think I shall ever forget it. It was&#xD;
so solemn and yet so defiant, as itT he had&#xD;
said, 'So you are here to see the end!' My&#xD;
God, what an end! Madge "-and his voice&#xD;
grew so tender that she knew of whom he&#xD;
was going to speak-" you have heard how&#xD;
bravely and peacefully our father died? Well,&#xD;
even in this world, there is such a thing as&#xD;
retribution. I thought that, if I thought&#xD;
nothing else, as I stood by the death-bed of&#xD;
the man who killed him."&#xD;
Margaret thought it, too, as the dainty&#xD;
muslin she was hemming fell from her lap to&#xD;
the floor unheeded. She, too, remembered&#xD;
all that she had heard of the father whose&#xD;
existence had faded so early out of her own&#xD;
-of his stainless life and honorable death,&#xD;
as contrasted with the life and death of the&#xD;
man. who had murdered him. For even the&#xD;
world, usually so lenient in such matters,&#xD;
held Henry Tyrrell as guilty of the blood of&#xD;
Albert Churchill as if lie had stabbed him&#xD;
unawares in the darkness of the night. It is&#xD;
true that the affair had taken the form of a&#xD;
duel, but it had been prefaced by the most un-&#xD;
merited insult and there had been enough of&#xD;
unfairness in its actual arrangement to set a&#xD;
black mark on the survivor to the day of his&#xD;
death.&#xD;
This death caused a deep and wide-spread&#xD;
sensation in the community where it occurred.&#xD;
Unpopular as he was, Henry Tyrrell had been&#xD;
a man of great wealth, and consequently of&#xD;
great influence; hence his death could not be&#xD;
other than an event of importance. Nobody&#xD;
regretted him; nobody gave a tear, or even so&#xD;
much ~as a sigh, to his memory-but still&#xD;
everybody felt interested in the matter, as&#xD;
people will feel when there is a million or two&#xD;
of property in questioiii. The dead man's&#xD;
wife had preceded him long before to the&#xD;
&#xD;
HUGH'S 1&#xD;
&#xD;
other world; his only son was absent; so&#xD;
there was not a single kindred face around the&#xD;
deathbed where Hugh Churchill had stood,&#xD;
and this in itself is always pathetic, even&#xD;
when such a man as Henry Tyrrell is con-&#xD;
cerned. With regard to his heir and successor,&#xD;
little was known. From some cause or other,&#xD;
young Tyrrell had never fancied his native&#xD;
place, and ever since he attained to man's es-&#xD;
tate his visits there had been few and far be-&#xD;
tween. People said that the father and son did&#xD;
not "get on" very well, but this was mere&#xD;
conjecture; for their intercourse, as far as the&#xD;
world knew, had always been cordial in the&#xD;
extreme, and, those who knew best said, even&#xD;
warmly affectionate.&#xD;
Society at large, however, was rather in-&#xD;
credulous of this, and many curious glances&#xD;
were bent on Roland Tyrrell as he stood by&#xD;
his father's grave and watched the clods of&#xD;
earth falling heavily upon the coffin. He&#xD;
looked very pale-ghastly pale, in fact-as&#xD;
everybody observed; but he was resolutely&#xD;
composed. Not a tear sprang into the large&#xD;
dark eyes bent steadfastly downward, not a&#xD;
quiver came to the sternly-compressed lips.&#xD;
"He hardly assumes a decent appearance of&#xD;
grief!" said the majority of lookers-on, indig-&#xD;
nantly. But there were others whose gaze&#xD;
pierced below the surface, and more then one&#xD;
of these felt strangely touched by the mute&#xD;
suffering stamped on the young man's face.&#xD;
They, in turn, wondered a little, and said to&#xD;
each other, "Strange he should grieve so&#xD;
much for such a father!" But they looked at&#xD;
him with respectful sympathywatching him as&#xD;
he turned at last from the newly-heaped pile&#xD;
of earth, as he crossed the church-yard, pass-&#xD;
ing directly by the spot where Albert Church-&#xD;
ill had lain for many years, and drove away&#xD;
alone to his desolate home.&#xD;
A few days after the funeral, Hugh and&#xD;
Margaret Churchill were the recipients of an&#xD;
unexpected and startling surprise. A letter&#xD;
from the lawyer of the late Mr. Tyrrell for-&#xD;
mally notified them that the sum of fifty thou.&#xD;
sand dollars, having been bequeathed them&#xD;
by the will of the deceased, had been placed&#xD;
to their credit by his executor, and awaited&#xD;
their orders. After the first shock of amaze-&#xD;
me~1t-of absolutely incredulous surprise-&#xD;
was over, it would be hard to say with how&#xD;
much of burning indignation this information&#xD;
was received by one, at least, of the parties&#xD;
concerned. For a time Hugh's rage was al-&#xD;
&#xD;
most inarticulate-then it broke forth beyond&#xD;
all bounds.&#xD;
"Was the old villain mad, or was it only&#xD;
the devil's own malice which made him leave&#xD;
us such a posthumous insult?'~ he cried, ad-&#xD;
dressing Margaret, who sat with her eyes fixed&#xD;
on the letter' which contained this strange&#xD;
and apparently incomprehensible intelligence.&#xD;
"My God! if he was only alive, that I might&#xD;
fling it back to him with words such as he&#xD;
should never forget! Did he think that we&#xD;
are likely to accept a gift from him, or did he&#xD;
only mean to jeer us from his grave with our&#xD;
poverty and need? May his money perish&#xD;
with him, and may the eternal curse of God-"&#xD;
"0 Hugh!" said Margaret, and for once&#xD;
her voice had something of authority in it-&#xD;
"0 Hugh, for Heaven's sake, hush! Is Hen-&#xD;
ry Tyrrell's insult-granting that he meant it&#xD;
as an insult-worth such passion as this?&#xD;
Remember-he is dead!"&#xD;
"Yes" said her brother, bitterly, "but&#xD;
his hatred, and the acts born of his hatred,&#xD;
did not die with him! Think of all we owe&#xD;
him, Margaret-think of it for one moment!&#xD;
First and greatest, the death of our father;&#xD;
after that, andfrom that, what a tiain ofills!&#xD;
He-our father-was on the high-road to&#xD;
fortune, after years of effort, and, had lie&#xD;
lived one year long~ir, he would have made&#xD;
his wife and children independent of the&#xD;
world. As it was-cut off before one of his&#xD;
schemes had reached maturity-you know the&#xD;
bitter poverty which followed, the privations&#xD;
which ground us to the earth, and under which&#xD;
our mother died; you know what a hard strug-&#xD;
gle I have had, how my life has been marred&#xD;
and its best hopes blasted. All of this we&#xD;
owe to Henry Tyrrell. And now-now in his&#xD;
very grave-he sends one crowning insult, one&#xD;
last injury, and lie is so far beyond the reach&#xD;
of my arm that I can do nothing save appeal&#xD;
to God to judge between me and him!"&#xD;
"God has judged," said Margaret, in a&#xD;
low tone. "Is not that enough? Hugh- t&#xD;
stop and consider. Perhaps even Henry&#xD;
Tyrrell may have known remorse and meant r&#xD;
this as-las a reparation."               V&#xD;
~~Margaret!~~ r&#xD;
"Don't misunderstand me," said she, d&#xD;
quietly. "Don't think that I would accept n&#xD;
it sooner than yourself. But why regard it ii&#xD;
in a light which he-the dead man-never ii&#xD;
may have meant?" o&#xD;
"I would stake my existence that he u&#xD;
&#xD;
49&#xD;
&#xD;
VENDETTA.                            48&#xD;
meant it!" Hugh said, fiercely. "And 1&#xD;
would stake it, also, that his son-a worthy&#xD;
son of such a father-was only too glad to&#xD;
fulfil his bequest, and thus safely to wound&#xD;
and sting us! But, thank God!" cried the&#xD;
young man, with quickening eyes, "lie is&#xD;
alive, and can be held to an account."&#xD;
"Hugh, arc you mad?" demanded Mar-&#xD;
garet, turning pale as she looked at his ex.&#xD;
cited face. "What possible reason have you&#xD;
to talk like this 1' What has Roland Tyrrell&#xD;
to do with the acts of his father?"&#xD;
"He has every thing to do with them,"&#xD;
answered Hugh, coldly. "He is his father's&#xD;
representative, and as such I shall hold him.&#xD;
Don't be afraid that I will make a fool of my.&#xD;
self," he went on, impatiently, as he met her&#xD;
eyes, full of anxious appeal. "The time has&#xD;
not yet come for a Tyrrell and a Churchill to&#xD;
reckon up scores. But, sooner or later, it&#xD;
wilt come, and then I shall hold him to a&#xD;
stern account. Do you remember the old&#xD;
Corsican custom of the vendetta? It was not&#xD;
a bad idea that, when one generation had&#xD;
suffered a wrong, another should avenge it.&#xD;
Well, 1 have sworn a vendetta against all of&#xD;
Henry Tyrrell's blood, and I will never forget&#xD;
or forsake it so long as God gives me life?"&#xD;
"It was a custom and an idea worthy of&#xD;
heathens-not of Christians," said Margaret.&#xD;
"So be it," answered her brother. "All&#xD;
the same, it is mine. Now give me some&#xD;
pens and paper, that I may answer this law-&#xD;
yer at once."&#xD;
The lawyer was answered-in what spirit&#xD;
t is not difficult to imagine-and there Hugh&#xD;
supposed that the matter would end. It was&#xD;
iot long, however, before he learned the error&#xD;
if this opinion. Coming home from work one&#xD;
~vening-he was an engineer, in the employ&#xD;
a mining company-he met Roland Tyrrell&#xD;
t the gate of the pretty little cottage where&#xD;
~[argaret and himself lived. Advancing from&#xD;
)pposity directions, the two men came face&#xD;
o face exactly at this spot.&#xD;
Through the soft autumn dusk Hugh had&#xD;
recognized the tall figure, moving toward him&#xD;
rith a quick, decisive tread, and he could not&#xD;
strain an emotion of involuntary surprise. It&#xD;
id not occur to him for a second that Tyrrell&#xD;
iight wish to see 1dm, and it chanced that,&#xD;
a order to be near the mines, the cottage in&#xD;
rhich the Churehills lived was verymuch out&#xD;
f the large town of Ridgeford, and in a sub-&#xD;
rb chiefly inhabited by the manufacturing&#xD;

44                  HUGH'S VENDETTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
HUGH'S VENDETTA.                  45&#xD;
&#xD;
and mining class-for, after its mines, its&#xD;
mills were the great boast of Ridgeford.&#xD;
They were very proud, these young people,&#xD;
and one form of their pride had ever been to&#xD;
wear their poverty as openly and bravely* as&#xD;
other people make a point of wearing wealth.&#xD;
Hugh would have scorned himself if he had&#xD;
thought thathe took sufficient interest in Ro-&#xD;
land Tyrrell to wonder what he was doing in&#xD;
such a quarter at such an hour; but, all the&#xD;
same, he felt surprised to see him.&#xD;
This surprise was considerably augmented&#xD;
when-pausing as they met-Mr. Tyrrell quiet-&#xD;
ly lifted his hat and spoke:&#xD;
"This is Mr. Churchill, is it not?" Then,&#xD;
as Hugh assented, "Excuse the liberty ~ take&#xD;
in introducing myself, but I am Roland Tyr.&#xD;
rell, and I was on my way to see you. This&#xD;
is your house, is it not?"&#xD;
"This is my house," answered Hugh, in&#xD;
whose voice coldness and amazement seemed&#xD;
struggling for mastery. "But I confess, Mr.&#xD;
Tyrrell, that I am not at all prepared for the&#xD;
honor which you do me."&#xD;
"That is very likely," said Tyrrell, smil-&#xD;
ing slightly, though gravely. "But I have&#xD;
j           something that I must say to you, and, if you&#xD;
will allow me, I should prefer to say it under&#xD;
your own&#xD;
What could Hugh reply to this? Plainly&#xD;
nothing, if he desired to keep within the&#xD;
bounds of ordinary civility; and being, with&#xD;
all his faults, a gentleman, the young fellow&#xD;
did desire that whatever he felt should be&#xD;
evinced, and whatever he had to do should&#xD;
be done, according to the letter of that cour-&#xD;
tesy which especially~ distinguishes the gentle-&#xD;
man from the churl. He bowed, therefore,&#xD;
though very coldly, and opened the gate for&#xD;
his unwelcome visitor.&#xD;
"Fray walk in," he said.&#xD;
The other complied, and they walked to-&#xD;
gether up the short path which led to the&#xD;
door where no latch-key was needed, for it&#xD;
stood open to the dying beauty of the Octo-&#xD;
ber day, and showed the bright llleker of a&#xD;
wood-fire from a room within. Sweet and&#xD;
home-like it looked-a contrast, indeed, to&#xD;
the stately, gloomy house where Roland Tyr.&#xD;
rell lived alone-and, as they entered the&#xD;
hall, a figure started up from a low chair in&#xD;
front of the sparkling blaze on the parlor-&#xD;
hearth&#xD;
"Is that you, Hugh?" asked a pleasant&#xD;
voice. "I had a fire made because I thought&#xD;
&#xD;
it would look cheerful, and, do you know, 1&#xD;
believe I have been half asleep."&#xD;
"My sister, Mr. Tyrrell," said Hugh, in a&#xD;
tone of ice.&#xD;
The firelight was pretty and soft with its&#xD;
capricious glow, but it was not very bright,&#xD;
and the dusk was deep in the little parlor, so&#xD;
nobody saw much of the surprise which Mar.&#xD;
garet Churchill must have felt. One uncon-&#xD;
trollable start she gave, but that was all, and&#xD;
her only welcome to this strange guest was a&#xD;
silent bow.&#xD;
Then they sat down - Margaret in the&#xD;
shade-and Hugh, who was ever impetuous,&#xD;
plunged at once to the point.&#xD;
"I must repeat that I am at a loss to&#xD;
imagine what you can have to say that has&#xD;
gained me, this visit, Mr. Tyrrell."&#xD;
"Are you?" said Mr. Tyrrell, in a tone&#xD;
of some surprise. "Then you must have for-&#xD;
gotten very soon a communication which you&#xD;
received from my lawyer the other day; or&#xD;
else you must consider me very careless of&#xD;
my father's solemnly.expressed desire if you&#xD;
think I could rest satisfied with the decision&#xD;
you returned to him."&#xD;
Hugh made an impatient gesture.&#xD;
"That matter was ended when I answered&#xD;
your lawyer's letter," he said. "If you have&#xD;
come here to reopen it in any manner, you&#xD;
have given yourself a great deal of useless&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
"You mean that you are determined to&#xD;
refuse the bequest of a man who, however&#xD;
deeply he may have wronged you, has passed&#xD;
beyond the reach of your resentment now?"&#xD;
"I mean," answered Hugh, almost fierce.&#xD;
ly, "that if the man who bequeathed this in.&#xD;
suit to those whom he has 59 deeply injured,&#xD;
were only alive, I would fling it scornfully&#xD;
into his teeth. Since that is impossible, I&#xD;
cast it back into the hands ofthose to whom&#xD;
he delegated this last office of hatred, and"&#xD;
his voice fairly trembled with passion here-&#xD;
"bid them take heed how they come to press&#xD;
the offer of that which has been once re-&#xD;
jected."&#xD;
Leaning forward in the firelight, Roland&#xD;
Tyrrell fastened his dark eyes keenly on the&#xD;
kindling face before him. At those last&#xD;
words of menace, a white hand stole out of&#xD;
the dusky shadows and laid itself with a gen-&#xD;
tle, warning touch on Hu~h's shoulder. Tyr.&#xD;
rell's gaze fell for a moment on this before&#xD;
he spoke. Then he said, as quietly as ever:&#xD;
&#xD;
"I judged from your letter that you tool&#xD;
some such view of my father's bequest ai&#xD;
this, and I came prepared to find you fai&#xD;
from moderate in feeling oi~ expression. I see&#xD;
you wonder wky I came" (the question had&#xD;
risen plainly to Hugh's eyes). "Simply for&#xD;
this: to do an act of justice to the dead.&#xD;
You say that, in leaving you a legacy, my&#xD;
father meant to leave you a posthumous in-&#xD;
suIt. In this you wrong him as much as it&#xD;
is in the power of one man to wrong another.&#xD;
For many years before his death he bore about&#xD;
a continually augmenting sense of the great&#xD;
injury he once did you. It poisoned his life&#xD;
so entirely that his only comfort rested in&#xD;
the thought of some reparation, which, how.&#xD;
ever inadequate it might be, would at least&#xD;
serve to mark his great remorse and great&#xD;
desire to make atonement. He knew that,&#xD;
besides other suffering, his act had entailed&#xD;
great pecuniary privation upon you, and this,&#xD;
at least, he wished to remove. During his&#xD;
life he was aware that you would accept no&#xD;
service at his hands, but he trusted that, after&#xD;
his death, you, who call yourself a Christian&#xD;
man, would not refuse the poor and weak&#xD;
atonement which he strove to make. I, his&#xD;
son-I, who witnessed more of his suffering&#xD;
than any other, save his Maker-I ask you&#xD;
now if you dare to do this?"&#xD;
The grave, steadfast voice, with a ring of&#xD;
pathos in it so slight that a dull ear would&#xD;
not have caught it, had a certain accent of&#xD;
command as it asked the last question-as it&#xD;
seemed to plead for that poor soul gone,&#xD;
"with all its errors thick upon it," to the&#xD;
judgment-seat of God. But it pleaded to&#xD;
deaf ears as far as Hugh Churchill was con-&#xD;
cerned. He had listened coldly; he spoke,&#xD;
if possible, more coldly still:&#xD;
"Once more I repeat that you waste your&#xD;
time when you speak on this subject, Mr.&#xD;
Tyrrell. I grant the truth 'and sincerity of&#xD;
all you say, but my decision is unalterably&#xD;
fixed. An angel sent from high Heaven&#xD;
could not make me consent to accept the&#xD;
least favor or benefit from your father, or&#xD;
from any of his name and blood. I must beg&#xD;
you to accept this as final.,!'&#xD;
He rose as he spoke, thus signifying that&#xD;
the interview was at an end; but, to his sur-&#xD;
prise, Roland Tyrrell did not rise also. He&#xD;
quietly kept his seat, still leaning slightly&#xD;
forward, with his eyes turned toward that&#xD;
region of dim shadow where Margaret sat,&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
like a faint, suggestive outline of a woman's&#xD;
form.&#xD;
"You forget that your decision is not the&#xD;
only one, Mr. Churchill," he said, at length.&#xD;
"Your sister is of legal age, is she not? I&#xD;
have yet to hear whether she rejects my fa-&#xD;
ther's reparation as unequivocally as you&#xD;
have done."&#xD;
"I spoke for my sister as well as for my.&#xD;
self," Hugh answered, haughtily. "Margaret&#xD;
is here, however. If she desires, she can&#xD;
speak for herself."&#xD;
"I don't desire it, Hugh," said Margaret's&#xD;
voice, trembling softly out of the shadows.&#xD;
"I would rather you spoke for me."&#xD;
"I have spoken," said Hugh, laconically.&#xD;
"But pardon me if I ask, is this right?"&#xD;
said Tyrrell, for the first time directly ad-&#xD;
dressing Margaret. "You should think and&#xD;
act for yourself-not follow blindly your&#xD;
brother's example. I can scarcely think that&#xD;
you-a woman-are as utterly without com-&#xD;
passion for the sufferings and atonement of&#xD;
a most unhappy man as he seems to be."&#xD;
"My sister needs no schooling in her&#xD;
duty, sir," said Hugh, enraged at this bold-&#xD;
ness.-" Margaret, speak for yourself, and&#xD;
satisfy Mr. Tyrrell that, on a point of honor,&#xD;
we Churchills always think alike." ~&#xD;
The young autocrat uttered this imperi-&#xD;
ously, but for a moment no answer was re-&#xD;
turned. The flickering play of the firelight&#xD;
rose and fell many times before Margaret&#xD;
spoke from her nook of shadows - spnke&#xD;
gravely, yet very gently:&#xD;
"I think Hugh is quite right, Mr. Tyrrell,&#xD;
in declining to accept the bequest of which&#xD;
you speak. Apart from his influence, I am&#xD;
sure that it would never have occurred to me&#xD;
for a moment to accept any obligation-above&#xD;
all, such an obligation-from the hand that&#xD;
shed my father's blood. But "-her voice&#xD;
seemed to gather strength here-" I think&#xD;
,Hugh is very wrong in his great bitterness&#xD;
of feeling, and I, having heard and believed&#xD;
all, that you said of his remorse, would be&#xD;
glad if y~ur father stood here this moment,&#xD;
to learn ~ow fully and freely one Churchill,&#xD;
at least, forgives the crime ho committed and&#xD;
the wrong he wrought."&#xD;
There was a minute's sil~nce after these&#xD;
words were uttered. Indeed, it would be&#xD;
hard to say which of her twolisteners Mar-&#xD;
garet had taken most by surprise. Tyrrell,&#xD;
however, recovered hiss powes of speech and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="46" xml:id="VAC8071-00000027"/>&#xD;
HUGH'S VENDETTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
action first. While Hugh still glared in&#xD;
amazement at his sister, he rose and went&#xD;
over to her side. She certainly had not&#xD;
meant to give him her hand, but he took it&#xD;
in his own, nevertheless.&#xD;
"God bless you!" he said, in a voice that&#xD;
quivered with emotion. "You have spoken&#xD;
as a brave, generous woman should speak,&#xD;
and I-I shall never cease to be grateful to&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
More than this he could not say, even if&#xD;
he had desired to do so, for Hugh interfered,&#xD;
scornfully and coldly:&#xD;
"My sister is a woman, as you remark,&#xD;
Mr. Tyrrell, and, after the fashion of her sex,&#xD;
she has introduced, a purely irrelevant ques-&#xD;
tion into a matter of business. Since we&#xD;
have both agreed in declining your father's&#xD;
legacy, however, I believe there is nothing&#xD;
more to say."&#xD;
This time Roland Tyrrell took the hint so&#xD;
curtly given. He released Margaret's hand,&#xD;
and, with a parting bow to her, passed out&#xD;
of the room. But at the door of the cottage&#xD;
.....whither Hugh had followed him-he paused.&#xD;
"Is there any reason, Mr. Churchill" he&#xD;
said, frankly and kindly, "why the unfortu-&#xD;
nate enmity of our fathers should be revived&#xD;
and perpetuated in the second generation?&#xD;
Is there any reason why we should hold aloof&#xD;
for the sake of the sins or errors of others?&#xD;
I confess that it would make me very happy&#xD;
to bury the miserable past, and to greet you&#xD;
as a friend."&#xD;
As he spoke, he extended his hand, with&#xD;
a cordial grace which few men could have re-&#xD;
sisted, but Hugh Churchill drew haughtily&#xD;
back.&#xD;
"It is very magnanimous in you, Mr. Tyr-&#xD;
rell, to be willing to hury a past that has&#xD;
never injured you," he said. "But I am not&#xD;
yet in a position to meet your generosity on&#xD;
equal ground. When I have paid, to the ut-&#xD;
termost farthing, the debt which I owe your&#xD;
father, and when I have gained once more&#xD;
the level from which my father was cast,&#xD;
then, if you choose to offer your hand again,&#xD;
I may acc~ it. Not before."&#xD;
." Believe me, I am sorry," said Roland&#xD;
Tyrrell, in a low tone, "and believe, also,&#xD;
that you cannot readily do any thing which I&#xD;
shall resent. The great wrong my father&#xD;
wrought-the wrong for which I would freely&#xD;
give my life to atorw-stands ever between&#xD;
us like a shield, Yet, I do not think I shall&#xD;
&#xD;
be likely to offer again the hand you have&#xD;
once rejected. Pardon me now for having, in&#xD;
a measure, thrust myself upon you, and-good-&#xD;
evening."&#xD;
He lifted his hat ceremoniously and walked&#xD;
slowly~sway in the gathering dusk. Stand-&#xD;
ing at the parlor-window, Margaret Churchill&#xD;
saw his tall, stately figure vanish from sight&#xD;
as he passed out of the gate, and took a path&#xD;
which led through a d~bri8 of newly-rising&#xD;
houses, to where the long lines of quiverin~&#xD;
lamps marked the populous town.&#xD;
CHAI'TEU II.&#xD;
A GnAY, lowering sky overhead, the earth&#xD;
soaked with rain underneath, and a general&#xD;
air of dreariness and dampness everywhere,&#xD;
was what met the eye on a chill, November&#xD;
afternoon, three weeks after Roland Tyrrell's&#xD;
visit to the Churchill cottage. For a week&#xD;
Ridgeford had suffered from rains such as had&#xD;
not been known within generations, and in&#xD;
the wake of the rains had followed a most&#xD;
disastrous flood. Houses had been swept&#xD;
away, lives had been lost, and property to&#xD;
the amount of millions damaged by the tur-&#xD;
bulent violence of a stream just beyond the&#xD;
town-the famous water-power that turned&#xD;
its mills and made its wealth, now transCormed&#xD;
from a slave into a tyrant. At last, one af-&#xD;
ternoon, however, the windows of heaven&#xD;
seemed to have closed, the sullen clouds still&#xD;
hung heavy and dark, but the rain had ceased&#xD;
for the first time in eight days; and arrayed&#xD;
in a water-proof-provided also with a large&#xD;
umbrella-Margaret Churchill took advantage&#xD;
of the lull to set forth for some necessary&#xD;
domestic purchases.&#xD;
At first she thought that she would not&#xD;
go far into Ridgeford, but would make her&#xD;
purchases at some of the suburban shops&#xD;
that lined the way. But we have most of us&#xD;
known the unsatisfactory character of sub-&#xD;
urban shops, and Margaret, finding exercise&#xD;
pleasant after her week's confinement in the&#xD;
house, could not make up her mind to stop&#xD;
short of the establishments where she usually&#xD;
dealt. Walking on, therefore, she soon found&#xD;
herself in the heart of the town, jostling among&#xD;
a throng of people on the wet pavements,&#xD;
and finally talking across a familiar counter&#xD;
to a familiar dealer in teas and other grocer-&#xD;
ies. The man knew her well, and liked her&#xD;

bright face, as every one did who came in&#xD;
contact with it; so, while he took down her&#xD;
orders, and tied up her bundles, he descanted&#xD;
freely and fully on the great Ridgeford topic&#xD;
-the terrible and all-absorbing flood. De-&#xD;
spite the papers, and despite Hugh, Marga-&#xD;
ret had scarcely appreciated the awful deso-&#xD;
lation which had been wrought until it was&#xD;
brought home to her by the many minute&#xD;
particulars-the personal hardships and losses&#xD;
-that go to make up the full sum of such a&#xD;
public calamity. These were poured upon&#xD;
her now in such stream that it was only&#xD;
when a partial lull in the garrulity of her in-&#xD;
formant came, that she was able to take up&#xD;
her bundles and prepare to leave the shop.&#xD;
As she was in the act of doing so, the pro-&#xD;
prietor stepped from behind the counter to&#xD;
say, by way of adieu:&#xD;
~C If you have seen nothing of the floqd,&#xD;
Miss Churchill, it would be worth your while&#xD;
to take a look at it. You are hardly likely&#xD;
ever to see such another-at least, the Lord&#xD;
preserve us from its like in Ridgeford again!&#xD;
If you go home by Light Street-it won't&#xD;
take you very ihuch out of your way-you&#xD;
can get a tolerable view of the stream and&#xD;
the houses that are under water."&#xD;
Margaret thanked him, and said that she&#xD;
thought she would go home by Light Street.&#xD;
She almost changed her mind, however, when&#xD;
she came out and saw how threatening the&#xD;
clouds were; but, on consideration, she found&#xD;
it impossible to resist the temptation of see-&#xD;
ing the flood, now that it was at its height,&#xD;
so, clutching her umbrella firmly, she turned&#xD;
her steps toward Light Street. It was very&#xD;
much as the dealer in teas and other grocer-&#xD;
ies had told her. From this rather elevated&#xD;
point, she had a "tolerable view" of the&#xD;
submerged quarter, and of the angry, turbid&#xD;
water which had broken its bonds and done&#xD;
all the mischief. But Miss Churchill was a&#xD;
young lady of ambition, and, having seen&#xD;
thus much, she wanted to see more. The&#xD;
gloomy desolation of the sight fascinated her.&#xD;
She was anxious, and determined to have&#xD;
more than a mere glimpse of it.&#xD;
To obtain this was-ror seemed to her-&#xD;
easy enough~ By skirting around the sub-&#xD;
urbs of the town, she could reach home as&#xD;
safely, if not as speedily, as by following the&#xD;
direct course, it must be conceded that this&#xD;
was not a very prudent project, considering&#xD;
the gathering gloom of the sky, the lateness&#xD;
&#xD;
of the hour-for four o'clock is late in cloudy&#xD;
November weather-and the fact that her&#xD;
path would lie through half-built suburbs, in-&#xD;
habited almost entirely by manufacturing&#xD;
operatives. But Margaret could be wilful&#xD;
sometimes, and she was wilful just now. "I'll&#xD;
not have another chance," sibe' thought, with&#xD;
a glance at the clouds which should have de-&#xD;
terred her. Then, gathering her water-proof&#xD;
closer around her, she flitted away.&#xD;
In fifteen minutes; it began to rain; at&#xD;
half-past four, it was pouring, torrents; at a&#xD;
quarter to five, a man, i~aIking hurriedly along&#xD;
with his hat pulled over his brows,'and his&#xD;
coat buttoned up to his chin, in vain, defence&#xD;
against the sweeping blast, came first upon&#xD;
an umbrella scudding aimlessly along before&#xD;
the wind, and then upon a soaked figure of a&#xD;
woman standing helplessly in the midst of a&#xD;
rising pooi of water. Night was, closing over&#xD;
the wild scene of storm; the river, not far&#xD;
off; was pouring over its rapids with a sound&#xD;
like that of many Niagaras; the scattered&#xD;
houses of the neighl~"orh6od scarcely showed&#xD;
a light-for, in truth, they had all been for.&#xD;
saken by their inhabitants-and the whore&#xD;
picture was one which Roland Tyrrell was&#xD;
just thinking could scarcely be matched for&#xD;
complete-and it might readily prove danger-&#xD;
ous-desolation, when,'to his amazement, he&#xD;
stumbled upon This solitary 'woma~,' who,&#xD;
lifting 'up her face, in 'the 'dying light, proved&#xD;
to be Margaret Churchill. '&#xD;
"Good Heavens!" he said, seizing her in-&#xD;
voluntarily, "Miss Churchill! Is it you?.'?&#xD;
"0 Mr. Tyrrell 1" said Margaret,'~with a&#xD;
half-hysterical gasp 'of relief. Wet, bewil-&#xD;
dered, almost despairing, as she had been the&#xD;
moment before, she clung to him asshe might&#xD;
have clung to Hugh. It was so good to have&#xD;
a protector-and, in truth, few women' could&#xD;
have asked a better protector than, he who&#xD;
stood looking down upon her .in amazement.&#xD;
"Is it you ~" he repeatedas if he could&#xD;
not realize the fact. "For Heaven's sake,&#xD;
what are you doing here?"&#xD;
"I don't know," 'said Margaret,. still. un-&#xD;
strung by the revulsion of terror an4~lief.&#xD;
"I started from home this Way',". sIi~ ient&#xD;
on, after a minute, "and I-I thiiik I must&#xD;
have got lost. Do you know where we arc,&#xD;
Mr. Tyrrell?"&#xD;
"Perfectly well," answered Tyrrehl. "AVe&#xD;

and a very dangerous neighborhood it is just&#xD;

48                           HUGH'S V&#xD;
now. To think of a woman here alone at&#xD;
such an hour! You might have wandered&#xD;
iato the flood, or fallen into the hands of&#xD;
prowling ruIllans-~--Good Heaven 1 how could&#xD;
you be so rash?" he broke off, almost an-&#xD;
grily~&#xD;
"I-I don't know," said Margaret, again&#xD;
-this time penitently. "I wanted to see the&#xD;
flood. It is not my fault, Mr. Tyrrell-I was&#xD;
sure I could reach home this way."&#xD;
"What madness I" he said. Then, in a&#xD;
lower tone, "God knows where you would&#xD;
have been in the morning, if I had not chanced&#xD;
to stumble upon you. Come this way."&#xD;
"If you will only be kind enough to show&#xD;
me how to get home," she said, meekly, cling.&#xD;
irig to him closely, as he hurried her along&#xD;
through the storm and gathering darkness.&#xD;
"I'm afraid that is impossible," he an.&#xD;
swered. "We are in a different quarter alto.&#xD;
gather, and you will suffer now from exposure&#xD;
to such a storm. We must find a refuge as&#xD;
soon as possible."&#xD;
"But Hugh will be so uneasy," pleaded&#xD;
Margaret.&#xD;
"Then he should have taken better care&#xD;
of you," was the rejoinder.&#xD;
After this, nothing more was said. Tyr-&#xD;
roll's decided manner bore down every thing,&#xD;
and Margaret felt that indeed any refuge&#xD;
would be better than the storm of howling&#xD;
wind and rain which beat upon them now.&#xD;
She did not ask where they were going, as&#xD;
her companion half led, half carried her over&#xD;
much uneven ground, and through number-&#xD;
less pools of water; but she felt sure that&#xD;
wherever that strong arm and gentle hand&#xD;
lad her she would be safe, and with that con-&#xD;
sciousness she was wise enough to be satis-&#xD;
fied.&#xD;
At last she heard Tyrrell say "Thank&#xD;
God I" and, looking round, she saw the dark&#xD;
outline of a building close at hand. The&#xD;
next moment he partly released her while he&#xD;
opened a door, thendrew her quickly within,&#xD;
and closed ~tr behind her. The sense of relief&#xD;
was almost overpowering-the Contrast be.&#xD;
tween the fierce battle they had been fighting&#xD;
and the refuge they had gained-and, spent&#xD;
from her long effort, Margaret would assured-&#xD;
ly have fallen if the same arm which had led&#xD;
had not now upheld her.&#xD;
"Courage I" Tyrrell said, in a tone of re-&#xD;
assurance, but also of anxiety. "Don't give&#xD;
way now that we are safe! Can I trust you&#xD;
&#xD;
'ENDTTA.HUGH'S VENDETTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
to stand alone one minute, while 1 strike a&#xD;
light?"&#xD;
Margaret said "Yes;" but no sooner was&#xD;
the support of his arm withdrawn, than she&#xD;
quietly sank down upon the floor. There she&#xD;
sat, leaning her head against the wall near&#xD;
which she chanced to be, while he felt about&#xD;
a little, finally struck a match, and then&#xD;
lighted a lamp.&#xD;
By the aid of this, she saw something of&#xD;
the habitation into which she had entered.&#xD;
Plainly a bachelor's den, for there was a bed&#xD;
in one corner, a cupboard in another, a table&#xD;
covered with books and papers, a pipe and a&#xD;
pair of pistols over the mantel, a kettle on&#xD;
the hearth, and a curious sort of masculine&#xD;
order-which is a very different thing indeed&#xD;
from feminine order-in all the arrangements.&#xD;
A glance at the walls and ceiling showed her&#xD;
that it was one of the better class of work-&#xD;
men's cottages which was thus metamor.&#xD;
phosed.&#xD;
Having lighted his lamp, Mr. Tyrrell's&#xD;
next step was to rummage in his cupboard,&#xD;
from which he brought forth a bottle and a&#xD;
tumbler.&#xD;
"You must take a stiff glass of brandy,&#xD;
Miss Churchill," he said, bringing these up to&#xD;
Margaret. "It is your o'nly hope of avoiding&#xD;
an attack of illness. Good Heavens, how wet&#xD;
you are!" he went on, touching her dress as&#xD;
he spoke.&#xD;
"Yes," said Margaret, meekly. The hood&#xD;
of her water-proof had fallen back, and her&#xD;
hair-drenched as a mermaid's-was rolling&#xD;
loosely down her back. As she looked up,&#xD;
she certainly presented as forlorn an appear-&#xD;
ance as a woman whom Nature had made&#xD;
pretty could possibly manage to do. She&#xD;
swallowed the brandy without any demur&#xD;
whatever~, then let him disembarrass her of her&#xD;
cloak, and assist her into a large easy-chair,&#xD;
where he bade her be quiet for five minutes.&#xD;
She obeyed, watching with languid yet&#xD;
slightly - amused interest his proceedings.&#xD;
Certainly he was very deft in knowing what&#xD;
to do and how to do it. In two minutes he&#xD;
had kindled a fire which was soon burning&#xD;
brightly, and put the kettle upon it. Then&#xD;
lie fished a pair of dingy slippers from a re-&#xD;
cess and brought them to her.&#xD;
"You must take off your shoes and pitt&#xD;
these on," he said. "i'm sorry that I have&#xD;
nothing else which I can offer you."&#xD;
"This is all I shall need," answered she.&#xD;
&#xD;
~'The water-proof did its duty, and I'm no&#xD;
v~~j wet. But you "&#xD;
"Never mind about me," he interrupted&#xD;
"Come up to the fire and dry yourself as wel&#xD;
as you can. I am going out for a few mm&#xD;
utes."&#xD;
He went out, and did not return for a&#xD;
least a quarter of an hour. By that tim&#xD;
Margaret had changed her shoes, dried-ai&#xD;
least in a measure-her drenched skirts&#xD;
shaken out her hair, realized her position, anc&#xD;
summoned back sufficient spirit to meet it,&#xD;
It was a very changed face, flushed half b~&#xD;
the fire, half by excitement, and (if there can&#xD;
possibly be three halves to a whole) half pei~&#xD;
haps by the brandy she had been forced to&#xD;
swallow, which turned round when Roland&#xD;
Tyrrell entered, if possible more drenched&#xD;
than before.&#xD;
"I have been out to observe the weather,&#xD;
Miss Churchill," he said, sinking involuntarily&#xD;
into a chair. "I fear that it will make a pris-&#xD;
oner of you for some hours to come-proba-&#xD;
bly, indeed, for the night. I have never seen&#xD;
a more terrible storm, and the flood is rising&#xD;
rapidly. God pity the poor in its path to.&#xD;
night l" he added, half to himself.&#xD;
"Are u's in danger?" asked Margaret,&#xD;
shivering slightly, for even above the voice&#xD;
of the tempest she could hear the terrible&#xD;
roar of the river.&#xD;
"Oh, no," he answered. "Do you think&#xD;
I would keep you here if you were in danger?&#xD;
This is a very elevated position. Do you&#xD;
know Conrad's Hill? That is where you are,&#xD;
and this house is one of a number which I&#xD;
was building for my inill.operatives. They&#xD;
are not likely to need them now," he said,&#xD;
with a shrug.&#xD;
Margaret's communicative grocer had told&#xD;
her that among the mill-owners Mr. Tyrrell&#xD;
had suffered most severely-that, in fact, he&#xD;
was very nearly "as good as a ruined man"&#xD;
-so the tone of this last sentence did not&#xD;
surprise her. It only made her feel very&#xD;
sorry ~'or him, and she looked up with her&#xD;
quick eyes full of sympathy.&#xD;
"Is that why you are here?" she asked.&#xD;
"That?" he repeated, looking a little puz-&#xD;
zled. "The destruction~ of my mills, do you&#xD;
mean? No, I came here to be within reach&#xD;
of the sufferers from the flood, and to be able&#xD;
to relieve them somewhat. It is little enough&#xD;
that one can do I" he added, with a short sigh.&#xD;
He seemed so utterly unconscious of hay-&#xD;
&#xD;
t lug done any thing himself-he seemed to&#xD;
consider it so entirely natural that he should&#xD;
have forsaken his comfortable and pleasant&#xD;
I associations to come and live in an operative's&#xD;
- cottage, and to devote his days to the aid of&#xD;
those who had worked for him-that Mar-&#xD;
I garet really had nothing to say. One cannot&#xD;
well praise a man who does not know that he&#xD;
has done any thing for which4o be praised.&#xD;
After a while, however, she looked at him&#xD;
I again, and suggested that he was very wet.&#xD;
"I ant used to that," he said, smiling a&#xD;
little.&#xD;
Still he drew nearer the fire, and, when&#xD;
she insisted that he should take his slippers&#xD;
-her own shoes being dry by this time-he&#xD;
* could not refuse to exchange his wet boots&#xD;
for them. This, of course, made him more&#xD;
comfortable, and, observing that the top of&#xD;
the kettle was being merrily lifted off by the&#xD;
steam, he asked Margaret if she had had&#xD;
any supper.&#xD;
When she replied in the negative, he went&#xD;
to his cupboard and brought forth a teapot&#xD;
and paper of tea.&#xD;
"I hope you don't prefer coffee," he said,&#xD;
a little anxiously, "for I never drink it my-&#xD;
self, and I have no r~ieans to make it, nor, in-&#xD;
deed, any to make."&#xD;
Margaret hastened to assure him of her&#xD;
preference for tea, thinking the while a little&#xD;
blankly of the pound or two of the best O~-&#xD;
long which she had lost in the struggle to re-&#xD;
tain her umbrella, and watched the process&#xD;
of steeping with the appreciation of a good&#xD;
house-keeper. But she could not remain&#xD;
quiet when he next produced a loaf of bread&#xD;
and proceeded to cut it into slices for toast.&#xD;
"I can do that," she said, eagerly.&#xD;
"Please let me," as he demurred, and declined&#xD;
to resign the toasting-fork. "You have no&#xD;
idea how very nice my toast is. Hugh will&#xD;
never let a servant make any for him. Look!&#xD;
you are burning that piece. Pray give it to&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
She pleaded so earnestly that he had no&#xD;
alternative but to let her have her own way;&#xD;
so she sat down to toast the bread and scorch&#xD;
her face in peace. She made a very pretty&#xD;
picture on the hearth in the flickering fire-&#xD;
light, with her bright-brown hair loose about&#xD;
her shoulders; and Tyrrel, who had mean-&#xD;
while brought forth a half-eaten ham from his&#xD;
inexhaustible cupboard, could not hut pause&#xD;
now and then, in the business of cutting it, to&#xD;

look, and wonder if he was awake or dream-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
It was a very sociable little supper to&#xD;
which they sat down after a while, and by this&#xD;
time they had become quite sociable them-&#xD;
selves; so that, when Margaret began plait-&#xD;
ing her hair to get it out of the way (for she&#xD;
had lost all such necessary appendages as&#xD;
comb and hair-pins), she gave Tyrrell a reca-&#xD;
pitulation of the losses which the storm had&#xD;
entailed upon her.&#xD;
"I have paid almost as dearly as Eve for&#xD;
my curiosity," she said. "I have lost an um-&#xD;
brella-Hugh's umbrella, and a very good one&#xD;
-three pounds of tea, a hat and veil which I&#xD;
bought only the other day, and two braids,&#xD;
which are iucom~arably the greatest loss of&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"I should not think you needed such&#xD;
things as braids," Tyrr~l1 remarlied. "Your&#xD;
own hair is very abundaut."&#xD;
"So it is,', she answered, threading the&#xD;
soft locks through her fingers; "but, all the&#xD;
same, one needs braids when fashion dictates&#xD;
that every woman shall wear exactly three&#xD;
times as much hair as could possibly grow on&#xD;
her head."&#xD;
"You did not use to wear them," he said.&#xD;
She looked up at him quickly, and he saw&#xD;
the bright blood come like a flash to her face.&#xD;
IL How do you know? ~ she asked, in a low&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"Do you think I have forgotten?" he&#xD;
said, with something which seemed like sud-&#xD;
den passion. "My memory is not so short,&#xD;
Margaret." Then, after a pause which she did&#xD;
not break: "Sometimes I wish to Heaven it&#xD;
were I These five years have been little else&#xD;
than one long torture and hunger to mc-&#xD;
such hunger for one sight of your face that I&#xD;
would often have given the best years of life&#xD;
to see it for one half-hour as I see it now."&#xD;
"Is this kind?" she asked, looking not&#xD;
at him, but at the leaping blaze before them.&#xD;
"You know that 1 am here in your power-&#xD;
is it generous to talk to me like this?"&#xD;
"No-it is not," he answered, quickly.&#xD;
"Forgive me for having done so. But how&#xD;
can I see you and not think of that~ happy&#xD;
fortnight when I saw you first-five long&#xD;
yearsago 1 It seems to me," he added, a little&#xD;
wistfully, "that you did not think so much&#xD;
then of the fact that I was a Tyrrell, and you&#xD;
a Churchill, as you do now."&#xD;
"How could I?" she asked, still avert-&#xD;
&#xD;
in~ her gaze. "I was little more than a&#xD;
child, and I had heard very little of-of your&#xD;
name. I scarcely realized, indeed, when I&#xD;
met you as one of that gay party at Beech-&#xD;
dale, wile you were, until I came home and-&#xD;
Hugh told me."&#xD;
"No doubt he told you also that it was&#xD;
your duty to hate the son of your father's&#xD;
murderer."&#xD;
This was so true that she could not deny&#xD;
it, therefore she said nothing.&#xD;
"Tell me, Margaret," said Tyrrell, bend-&#xD;
ing forward, "has he made you hate me?&#xD;
You did not use to do it, I know; for I do&#xD;
not think there was ever a sweeter or bright-&#xD;
er thing on earth than your face when I saw&#xD;
it last. But how can I tell what five years&#xD;
have done?"&#xD;
"Five years have not taught sue to hate&#xD;
you, Mr. Tyrrell," she said, turning and look-&#xD;
ing at him with her soft brown eyes. "But"&#xD;
-and her voice had a ring of decision in it&#xD;
which he knew well how to interpret-" they&#xD;
have not taught me either to forget that lam&#xD;
Albert Churchill's daughter."&#xD;
"And Hugh Churchill's sister," he said, a&#xD;
little bitterly.&#xD;
"I know what you mean," she answered,&#xD;
coloring; "but you are mistaken. Hugh has&#xD;
never succeeded in influencing me to his&#xD;
opinions. He would gladly make me hate you&#xD;
as-pardon mc that 1 must confess it-as&#xD;
he does; but I hope you will believe me when&#xD;
I say that he has never done so. Even if I&#xD;
did not forgive your father-and God knows&#xD;
that I d~ I-I could not be so unjust as to&#xD;
hold you accountable for his crime. Icoud&#xD;
not, Mr. Tyrrell!" she repeated, almost pas-&#xD;
sionately.&#xD;
"I believe you," he said. "I believe you&#xD;
and thank you. But for the rest-O Mar-&#xD;
garet! for the rest 1 Am I alone, of all men,&#xD;
to have no opportunity or hope to win you&#xD;
because my name is Tyrrell ?"&#xD;
Lb You must feel as well as 1 do that there&#xD;
'is a gulf between us that nothing can bridge,"&#xD;
'she answered, gravely. "It is hopeless to&#xD;
talk of such a thing, Mr. Tyrrell-worse than&#xD;
hopeless, indeed. It seems like an insult to&#xD;
the dead. I am sorry-oh, what a weak word&#xD;
that is 1-I am far, far more than sorry that&#xD;
it should have fallen to my lot to give you&#xD;
pain, but the truth must be faced; if you and&#xD;
I lived forever, we could never be more to&#xD;
each other thas we are now."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Never, Margaret?"&#xD;
"Never."&#xD;
She did not speak bitterly or vehemently&#xD;
on the contrary, she spoke with great sadness&#xD;
and infinite gentleness, but Tyrrell felt to di&#xD;
very centre of his soul that Hugh's fier:&#xD;
hatred was more likely to turn into love thai&#xD;
this decision of his sister to be moved o~&#xD;
shaken. The young engineer had been righ&#xD;
when he said, in his impetuous pride, "On&#xD;
point of honor we Churchills always thini&#xD;
alike," and even he might have been satisfied&#xD;
that Margaret remembered as deeply as him.&#xD;
self their black and bloody debt to Henry&#xD;
Tyrrell.&#xD;
After her last words there was silence in&#xD;
the room. The wind howled, the rain fell,&#xD;
the river roared without. There were many&#xD;
desolate and aching hearts in Hidgeford that&#xD;
night; many who had seen fortune, and not&#xD;
a few who had seen friends and relations, go&#xD;
down in the merciless flood; but none were&#xD;
more desolate, none ached with a more dreary&#xD;
sense of hopeless loss, than his who sat by&#xD;
that sparkling fire with Margaret Churchill's&#xD;
fair face opposite him.&#xD;
After a while, seeing that the night was&#xD;
wearing on, she asked anxiously if there was&#xD;
no possible hope for her to get home. He&#xD;
answered by bidding her come to a window&#xD;
and drawing back the blind.&#xD;
"Shade your eyes and look out," he said.&#xD;
"Then tell me what you see."&#xD;
She obeyed-that is, she obeyed in part.&#xD;
She shaded her eyes, and strove, with her&#xD;
gaze, to pierce the darkness of the murky&#xD;
and tempestuous night beyond, but in vain.&#xD;
Only the rain dashing against the window-&#xD;
panes, only the blast that seemed as if it&#xD;
might lift the roof from oil' the cottage, told&#xD;
her what was raging without. She looked&#xD;
round at him in blank dismay.&#xD;
"Is there no hope, then?" she said. "0&#xD;
Mr. Tyrrell, must I stay here alinight?"&#xD;
"I am afraid you must," he answered,&#xD;
gravely, closing the blind again. "At least 1&#xD;
know that if you and 1 ventured out in this&#xD;
storm, we should not be likely ever to be&#xD;
beard of again. Forgive me for bringing you&#xD;
here," he went on, as he saw the distress on&#xD;
her face. "I could net think of any thing&#xD;
else to do. It was very stupid, vea'y thought..&#xD;
less, of me not to ~&#xD;
But she interrupted him here by holding&#xD;
out her hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
Lb Forgive me for seeming ungrateful for&#xD;
such a kind shelter," she said. "You know,&#xD;
or you ought to know, that you did the best&#xD;
s possible thing for me-the only thing, indeed.&#xD;
a Of course It is awkward "-laughing slightly&#xD;
-Lb but you and I are old enough and seu~i.&#xD;
z ble enough to disregard that. If I was only&#xD;
sure that Hugh was not wretched about me I"&#xD;
"May he not think that, being caught by&#xD;
the storm, yen remained in town?"&#xD;
"It is likely that he may. I have some&#xD;
I friends with whom I often do remain. Thank&#xD;
you for the suggestion, Mr. Tyrrell. Now,&#xD;
shall we make our arrangements for the&#xD;
night? I am so sorry to think how much I&#xD;
shall inconvenience you~~&#xD;
"Do not grudge me this little service,"&#xD;
he said. "God knows, and you know, that&#xD;
it may be the last I shall ever have the op..&#xD;
opportunity to render you l"&#xD;
There was some difficulty about the ar-&#xD;
rangements for the night, since the choice&#xD;
rested between the bed-which was, in truth,&#xD;
little more than a sofa-and the easy-chair.&#xD;
Each of them wanted to sit up and let the&#xD;
other rest; but, of course, Tyrrell carried his&#xD;
point; and while Margaret lay down, and, de-&#xD;
spite the novelty of her position, soon fell into&#xD;
the sound sleep of healthy youth, he sat by&#xD;
the fire and watched the stormy nightthrougla&#xD;
and the gray dawn break over the drenched&#xD;
earth.&#xD;
-4----&#xD;
CI~AFTER 111.&#xD;
WHEN Margaret woke the next moriiing,&#xD;
she found herself alone in the room-a bright&#xD;
fire burning on the hearth, and a cloudy apol-&#xD;
ogy for daylight streatning in. It required*&#xD;
several minutes for her to remember where&#xD;
she was; but then it all came back with a&#xD;
rush, and, rising, she walked across the floor,&#xD;
and drew back the blind of the window. It&#xD;
~had ceased to rain; but the terrible ravages&#xD;
of the storm were evident on every side, and&#xD;
she could not help thinking that the waters&#xD;
of the deluge, abating from the face of the&#xD;
earth, may have presented much such a&#xD;
seeming as the scene on which she gazed.&#xD;
As she still looked, she saw Tyrrell striding&#xD;
along through mud and water toward the&#xD;
house; and, turning when he entered, she&#xD;
asked at once where he had been.&#xD;

he answered. "It was rather difficult, for&#xD;
the rain last night seems to have inundated&#xD;
the brains of all Ridgeford, and vehicles are&#xD;
in great demand for the people escaping from&#xD;
the neighborhood of the flood. A carriage&#xD;
will be here in a few minutes, however."&#xD;
He looked so pale and haggard, as the&#xD;
morning light streamed over his face, that&#xD;
she was suddenly stricken with remorse to&#xD;
think how he had been working for her&#xD;
while she slept.&#xD;
"How has the rain of last night affected&#xD;
you, Mr. Tyrrell ?" she asked.&#xD;
"It has made something very like a ruined&#xD;
man of ~ he answered. "lint I think very&#xD;
little-too little, perhaps-of that. I have&#xD;
only myself to care for, you know; and, when&#xD;
one stands alone, no blow of Fortune can be&#xD;
very severe.~~&#xD;
Margaret was not by any means sure of&#xD;
this, but she did not contradict him. She&#xD;
only glanced up with a smile, and said:&#xD;
"Shall I not make you some tea? You&#xD;
look so tired."&#xD;
His face brightened as by a flash. "Yes,"&#xD;
he said, eagerly. "Yes, if you will be so&#xD;
kind."&#xD;
So she set to work in her c~ieery way-a&#xD;
way that had brightened her own home like&#xD;
a sunbeam for twenty.two years-and soon&#xD;
had the tea ready-such tea as Mr. Tyrrell&#xD;
was not in the habit, nor, indeed, capable, of&#xD;
making for himself. He took it from her&#xD;
hand as if it had been the veritable nectar&#xD;
of the gods; and, in truth, the poor fellow&#xD;
needed4t badly. He had taken a more pow-&#xD;
erful stimulant at an earlier hour, but, to re.&#xD;
vive jaded energies and tired faculties, there&#xD;
is no power in brandy to equal that which&#xD;
lurks in one strong cup drawn from the fra-&#xD;

up to the door. Miss Churchill rose and put&#xD;
on her water-proof, drawing the hood over&#xD;
her hatless head, and then, since this com-&#xD;
pleted her preparations for departure, turned&#xD;
to Tyrrell.&#xD;
"How can I thank you for all your kind.&#xD;

moment, then went on, with a crimson cheek&#xD;
-"it has, if possible, made me regret still&#xD;

greatest happiness that Fate ever gave to me,&#xD;
und one on the memory of which I shall live&#xD;

taken, by this time, the small, ungloved hand&#xD;
which she offered him, and, holding it now,&#xD;
gazed with passionate wistfulness into her&#xD;
face. "Margaret," he said, hoarsely, "for&#xD;
the last time, the very last time, let me ask&#xD;
'is there, can there be, no hope for me?"&#xD;
She looked at him, and he read his answer&#xD;
in her sorrowful eyes. Then, after a minute:&#xD;
"Why do you embitter our parting like&#xD;
this?" she asked, sadly. "You know we&#xD;
are not likely ever to meet again. Why not&#xD;
let us say farewell as friends-or, if not as&#xD;
friends, at least as acquaintances who have&#xD;
met and liked each other sincerely?"&#xD;
"Then we are not even friends?"&#xD;
"How can we be?" she asked, still sadly.&#xD;
"Do friends live as far apart as we must ever&#xD;
do? 0 Mr. Tyrrell I "-her voice broke down&#xD;
here into something like a wail-" let me go.&#xD;
For God's sake do not prolong this hopeless&#xD;
pain!"&#xD;
"Pain! Is it pain to you?" he cried,&#xD;
quick to catch the new accent in her voice.&#xD;
"0 Margaret! one word-only one word-&#xD;
before you go. If we had met like other&#xD;
people-if this horrible barrier of past crime&#xD;
had not been between us-could you, oh, my&#xD;
darling I-could you ever have learned to&#xD;
love me? If you can tell me that, Margaret,&#xD;
it seems to me that I can face even the deso-&#xD;
late future with a brave heart if I know&#xD;
that."&#xD;
But she did not answer him. Her pale&#xD;
lips did not move; her downcast eyes did not&#xD;
lift; she only suddenly drew her hand from&#xD;
the clasp of his, and darted toward the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
He followed, and assisted her into the car-&#xD;
riage; then, to her surprise, entered also, and&#xD;
closed the door.&#xD;
"Arc you coming with me?" she asked.&#xD;
"If you do not object," he answered, "I&#xD;

HUGH'S VENDETTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
He stared at her; but she beckoned him&#xD;
so impatiently to obey, that, after a second's&#xD;
hesitation, he did so-guessing, in part, at&#xD;
least, the cause of her anxiety. rer~haps he&#xD;
was not averse to sharing in the excitement&#xD;
himself. At all events, he whipped up his&#xD;
horses with laudable zeal, and, in a very few&#xD;
minutes, they reached the mines.&#xD;
Driving past the large works, where the&#xD;
sound of machinery had, for the present,&#xD;
stopped, and past the deserted offices (of&#xD;
which Hugh's was one), they came to the&#xD;
opening of the principal descent into the&#xD;
mine. It was not here, however, that a sig-&#xD;
nificant and terrible scene was enacting.&#xD;
Farther away, to the right, a new shaft had&#xD;
been lately sunk, and entirely new excava-&#xD;
tions made-concerning which, as Margaret&#xD;
well remembered, Hugh had been full of eager&#xD;
interest and hope. Several older engineers&#xD;
had opposed the move; but he had carried&#xD;
every thing before him with the company, and&#xD;
already the most favorable results had been&#xD;
anticipated. He had brought home trium-&#xD;
phantly several rich specimens of ore, and&#xD;
spoken gayly of the chagrin of those who had&#xD;
prophesied utter failure for the project. Now&#xD;
--was this to be the 'end?&#xD;
It certainly looked so. Around the fatal&#xD;
spot was gathered a crowd of many men and&#xD;
not a few women; the former looking as men&#xD;
only look in the face of some terrible tragedy;&#xD;
the latter, for the most part, wailing loudly,&#xD;
or sobbing dry sobs with that restraint of&#xD;
grief which is more terrible to behold than its&#xD;
wildest abandonment. Margaret a lighted here,&#xD;
and made her way through the throng to&#xD;
where the superintendent was standing, just&#xD;
at the mouth of the opening.&#xD;
"Mr. Beresford," she said, touching his&#xD;
arm, "is it true that Hugh is in there?"&#xD;
" Good Heavens, Miss Churchill !" said Mr.&#xD;
ileresford, turning round with a start. "Is it&#xD;
possible you are here? My dear young lady,&#xD;
this will never do. Come away instantly!"&#xD;
"Is Hugh there?" she reiterated, looking&#xD;
at him with her pale, set face. "Tell me the&#xD;
truth at once. I must know."&#xD;
"Well, then-yes, he is there!" he said,&#xD;
desperately. "Now, for God's sake, come&#xD;
away! This is no place for you!"&#xD;
She paid no heed to his adjuration. She&#xD;
only caught his arm, and asked another ques-&#xD;
tion through her white lips.&#xD;
"Is there any hope?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"We trust s6," he Said, eagerly. "We&#xD;
never give up hope until we know the worst.&#xD;
We only fear it now. You see, it has not&#xD;
been an hour since the wall fvll-not in the&#xD;
path; but, as well as we ~an judge, in the&#xD;
rear of the mining party-and we have had a&#xD;
large force at work ever since. Listen, and&#xD;
you can hear the ring of the pickaxes I"&#xD;
She listened with a sickening heart; and,&#xD;
though her ears were not trained like his, she&#xD;
thought she could faintly catch a dull and&#xD;
muffled sound, which told of the vigorous&#xD;
strokes of many arms. Once more she heard&#xD;
him urging her to come away, but she only&#xD;
shook her head. No earthly power could&#xD;
have forced her from the spot where Hugh&#xD;
was buried-alive, and yet dead! There are&#xD;
some things so horrible that the imagination&#xD;
refuses to grasp them. This was one of them&#xD;
to Margaret. Though she sat (for her trem.&#xD;
hung limbs refused to support her, and Mr.&#xD;
Beresford placed her on a stone not far away),&#xD;
like a pale image of despair, breathing the&#xD;
free air of heaven while ho was shut from it&#xD;
in the black depths of earth, she could not&#xD;
realize the awful horror pressing on her.&#xD;
They came, and went, and talked, around&#xD;
her, as men do under stress of great excite-&#xD;
ment; but she tlld not heed them. She was&#xD;
trying to wrest her mind from the upper world&#xD;
and take it into his dark prison; but it would&#xD;
not go. It reeled on the very brink of uncon-&#xD;
sciousness when she tried to picture him&#xD;
gasping, dying-so near her, yet, 0 Heaven!&#xD;
so far away.&#xD;
She felt as if it had been hours that she&#xD;
had sat there, frozen into a stony stillness by&#xD;
the very magnitude of her anguish, yet keenly&#xD;
alive to every sound that bore relation to Aim,&#xD;
when a faint cheer from the men below (that&#xD;
is, a cheerwhich wounded faint to those above)&#xD;
announced that they had reached the victims&#xD;
of the accident. In a second, Margaret sprang&#xD;
to her feet; but in a second, also, a strong&#xD;
hand held her back.&#xD;
"Wait!" said a familiar voice. "Not&#xD;
yet!"&#xD;
She turned, not in surprise-at such mo-&#xD;
ments people are rarely surprised s~ any&#xD;
thing-but with a sense of blind trust strange&#xD;
indeed in a woman usually so self.reliant as&#xD;
Margaret Churc~hill. Looking up into the&#xD;
dark eyes bent upon her-eyes full of pas-&#xD;
sionate pity and passionate love-her agony&#xD;
for the first time broke forth into words.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do you go, then!" she said. "I ci&#xD;
trust you to tell me if Hugh is-" H4&#xD;
white lips could not utter the word "dead,&#xD;
It seemed such an awful and such an unre~&#xD;
word to connect with Hugh's proud life an&#xD;
strength. "Then you will save him if ye&#xD;
can?" she went on, with trembling cage:&#xD;
ness. "0 Mr. Tyrrell! you are so brave an&#xD;
kind-will you not try to save him? Surel&#xD;
you are better able than they-those mc.&#xD;
yonder; surely you can if you will!"&#xD;
"God knows how willingly I would if&#xD;
could," Tyrrell said. "But those men you&#xD;
der understand such matters, and they hay&#xD;
done all that human effort can do."&#xD;
"But you are wiser than they," she per&#xD;
sister, feverishly. "You think I am childish&#xD;
to talk like this, but I feel-I know-tha&#xD;
God has sent you to help and to save him&#xD;
Am I mad? I don't know. But say yoi&#xD;
will try-oh, say you will try!"&#xD;
"I will try," he answered, carried away&#xD;
by her appeal, yet knowing that there wai&#xD;
nothing for him to do. "I swear to you&#xD;
that, if an opportunity arises, I will hold my&#xD;
own life for nothing in comparison with his.&#xD;
But will you promise me to stay here if I&#xD;
go?"&#xD;
"I promise," she said, and she sat down&#xD;
again on the seat from which she had risen.&#xD;
When Margaret Churchill said "I prom-&#xD;
ise" he must have been blind and deaf in-&#xD;
deed who didn't trust her-even at such a&#xD;
supreme moment as this. Tyrrell did, fully&#xD;
and entirely. He gave one glance ~t her face&#xD;
-rigid with an awful look of despair-then&#xD;
went his way without another word.&#xD;
They were bringing out the victims one&#xD;
by one when he reached the opening of the&#xD;
shaft. A terrible sight it was-with the&#xD;
fearful wail of some women rising now and&#xD;
then as a husband or a son was recognized.&#xD;
Most of them were dead. A few, who had&#xD;
been farther advanced in front, had escaped&#xD;
the heavy fall of the ill-supported earth, and&#xD;
still showed signs of life. Half hoping, yet&#xD;
half apprehensive, Tyrrell looked over the&#xD;
unconscious faces, but Hugh was not there.&#xD;
As he looked, Mr. Beresford approached.&#xD;
"No sign of Churchill yet," he said. "He&#xD;
must certainly have licen one of the farthest&#xD;
in the mine.&#xD;
"That gives hopes for his safety, doesn't&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"In a measure," the other answered, "but&#xD;
&#xD;
55&#xD;
&#xD;
in only in a measure. You see we got them out&#xD;
ir very quickly, and those men who were not&#xD;
.' immediately suffocated, may 'Very likely re-&#xD;
al cover. But every minute counts, and, the&#xD;
d longer they are in finding Churchill, the less&#xD;
u hope there is that he will be found alive."&#xD;
r-    "Yes, I see," said Tyrrell, thoughtfully.&#xD;
d Then, after a pause, he added: "Can I go&#xD;
y into the mine? I should like to see what&#xD;
II progress they are making, unless you object&#xD;
to the intrusion of outsiders."&#xD;
I "I do object, as a general rule," the su-&#xD;
perintendent answered. "There are plenty&#xD;
a of people here who would like nothing better&#xD;
than to go down there and stare, if they were&#xD;
- allowed to do so; but, of course, with you,&#xD;
a Mr. Tyrrell, it is a different matter. I'll send&#xD;
I a man down with you if you wish to go."&#xD;
-    Tyrrell reiterating his desire, the man was&#xD;
summoned, and they proceeded together into&#xD;
the mine. It was a strange, wild scene, and&#xD;
thoroughly novel to the man of the upper&#xD;
world, upon which they entered. The dark&#xD;
galleries opening away in different directions,&#xD;
with here and there the light of a miner's&#xD;
candle gleaming, the subterranean atmos-&#xD;
phere, the smell of fresh earth from the&#xD;
fallen wall, the force of men working with&#xD;
shovels and pickaxes by the light of lanterns&#xD;
and torches. As Tyrrell came up, an inani-&#xD;
mate figure was drawn forth and carried past&#xD;
him to the upper air. "Jackson," he heard&#xD;
the men saying to each other, and then some-&#xD;
body added, "Stone dead!"&#xD;
"You see they are still taking out the&#xD;
men on whom the earth fell," his guide said.&#xD;
"There's something like half a dozen niissing&#xD;
yet. If you are not 'afraid to come through&#xD;
this way, you'll find the place where they are&#xD;
looking for Mr. Churchill."&#xD;
Fear did not chance to be a word in Ro-&#xD;
land Tyrrell's vocabulary, so he followed the&#xD;
speaker, through an opening in the fallen&#xD;
earth, to where the advance portion of the&#xD;
mining party had been found. It was very&#xD;
near the end of the excavation, and men&#xD;
were working here eagerly, expecting every&#xD;
moment to find Hugh Churchill as they had&#xD;
found the others.&#xD;
"He'll never come out alive," Tyrrell's&#xD;
guide said, gloomily. "Not but that-steady&#xD;
boys! what are you after now?"&#xD;
They were after another inanimate figure,&#xD;
upon which they had stumbled, and which&#xD;
they were almost sure would prove the one&#xD;

HUGH'S VENDETTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
so anxiously sought. "Hold up, there!"&#xD;
they cried to the men who were working with&#xD;
pickaxes in front (foolishly enough, since the&#xD;
end of the excavation had plainly been&#xD;
reached); but these did not seem to hear,&#xD;
for, just as the others were lifting up the un-&#xD;
conscious face for identification, their axes&#xD;
went suddenly through into another and un-&#xD;
suspected excavation beyond-there was a.&#xD;
quick rattle of falling earth-a crust-like wall&#xD;
gave way - and a blast of air rushed out&#xD;
which proved ~ts noxious qualities by extin-&#xD;
guishing in an instant every one of the lights.&#xD;
The panic which ensued was neither so&#xD;
unwise nor so unnatural as might at first ap-&#xD;
pearJ If the men. threw down pickaxes and&#xD;
shovels to fly for their livesit was because&#xD;
they knew well that their lives were atatake&#xD;
-since, of all dangers Which the miner has to&#xD;
dread, the most deadly by far is the subtle&#xD;
poison known as mephitic air. Tyrrell's guide&#xD;
had sufficient consideration to seize him by&#xD;
the arm, and hurry him away at such a breath-&#xD;
less pace that he scarcely knew what had&#xD;
happened until he found himself beyond the&#xD;
point where the first earth had fallen.&#xD;
Even here the panic had spread, and the&#xD;
men were retreating. "All's up now," they&#xD;
said. "No hope for any man left in there&#xD;
when tluzt gets at him. The devil himself&#xD;
couldn't live in foul air!"&#xD;
"Where is Mr. Churchill ?" demanded'&#xD;
Tyrrell, as soon as he could be heard. Then,&#xD;
as an ominous silence followed the question:&#xD;
"For God's sake, you don't mean to tell me&#xD;
that you are men, and that you have left a man&#xD;
who could not help himself, to perish in&#xD;
there? Is it possible-has it been done?"&#xD;
It had indeed been done. No, one had&#xD;
thought of him. Each man had blindly&#xD;
rushed from the danger, and left the uncQn-&#xD;
scions one behind.&#xD;
"He is dead," some of them, said, by way&#xD;
of excuse.&#xD;
"No man knows that," Tyrrell answered.&#xD;
"No man ~an dare to say that he felt either&#xD;
his heart or his pulse. The presumption is&#xD;
that he is alive-and I call upon you as brave&#xD;
men to go back with me for him."&#xD;
There was a dead silence. Brave enough&#xD;
they were, the most of them; but not so&#xD;
brave as this. They had faced danger frim&#xD;
the falling earth, but they could not face cer-&#xD;
tain death from mephitic air. Nobody stirred&#xD;
Most of them were silent; only one or two&#xD;
&#xD;
murmured that there had been deaths enough,&#xD;
and that they had their families to consider.&#xD;
"Very well," said Tyrrell, scornfully, "I&#xD;
will go alone. Give me a lantern-something&#xD;
that cannot be extinguished easily; and I&#xD;
will show you whether or not you are a set of&#xD;
pitiful cowards. Only ".-he stopped a mo-&#xD;
ment and considered-" I am afraid I could&#xD;
scarcely bring him out alone. Is there any&#xD;
one here who can be bribed to do his duty&#xD;
by a thousand dollars? If so, let him speak&#xD;
at once. There is not a second to lose, and I&#xD;
will write a check before I go."&#xD;
His taunt stung one man at least into ac-&#xD;
tion. A stout, dark - brewed young fellow&#xD;
stepped forward.&#xD;
"You may keep your money, Mr. Tyrrell,"&#xD;
he said. "i'll go with you without a bribe.&#xD;
It's like to be certain death; but I've nobody&#xD;
depending on me, so it don't matter much,&#xD;
nohow."&#xD;
"All right," said Tyrrell, witl, a quick&#xD;
glance at him. "You'll do," he added. "Get&#xD;
the light we are to take-the quicker the bet-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
A couple of lanterns were brought, and a&#xD;
bucket of water for each of them, with which&#xD;
to dispel in a measure the poisonous gas.&#xD;
While these were being provided, Tyrrell&#xD;
heard an old miner explain the presence of&#xD;
the foul air. The mine was an old one, with&#xD;
several long-disused chambers-excavations&#xD;
which had been cut off by much such an ac-&#xD;
cident (though in the former case harmless)&#xD;
as the present; and it was evidently into one&#xD;
of these that the new excavation led. No-&#xD;
body had suspected it until the unguarded&#xD;
strokes of two or three men had laid bare the&#xD;
danger.&#xD;
it certainly was a terrible danger into&#xD;
which Tyrrell and his companion now ven-&#xD;
tured. They felt it in the faintness which&#xD;
made them stpgger and reel like drunken&#xD;
men when the first breath of the mephitic at-&#xD;
mosphere came over them; and, as they ad-&#xD;
vanced, it of course grew worse.&#xD;
"We must be quick," said the young&#xD;
miner, in -a half-stifled voice; "we can't&#xD;
stand this many minutes I" He set down his&#xD;
lantern hastily, and, raising his bucket of&#xD;
water with both hands to a level with his&#xD;
shoulder, cast the contents in showery dashes&#xD;
all around and over himself and his compan-&#xD;
ion; then, dropping the bucket, snatched up&#xD;
the light and hurried forward. Fortunately&#xD;
&#xD;
HUGH'S'&#xD;
they had but a few steps to go from the en-&#xD;
trance of the excavation to where Churchill&#xD;
was lying, face don~nward, just as he had&#xD;
been left by the men when they fled for their&#xD;
lives.&#xD;
"Thank God-here he is!" cried Tyr-&#xD;
rell.&#xD;
"Put down your light!" exclaimed the&#xD;
miner, who had already put his own out of&#xD;
his hand, and, with one vigorous effort, had&#xD;
turned Hugh upon his back. "Dash your&#xD;
water over his face-now for it!" and he&#xD;
seized Hugh's shoulders, motioning to Tyr.&#xD;
rell to assist. Gasping, giddy, and so 4int&#xD;
that they could scarcely stand, they half car-&#xD;
ried, half dragged him along between them&#xD;
to the opening of the excavation. The gases&#xD;
had by this time been considerably diluted&#xD;
by the outside air finding its way in; but&#xD;
still the atmosphere was horrible. The lights&#xD;
burned dimly, and both Tyrrell and his com-&#xD;
panion felt their strength and consciousness&#xD;
fast leaving them. As at last they reached&#xD;
the bound of safety-the opening in the fall-&#xD;
en wall-Tyrrell staggered, wavered, and fell&#xD;
heavily forward.&#xD;
"On-on!" he gasped, as his companion&#xD;
paused. "Don't stop for me-come back, if&#xD;
you will-but keep on now-on!"&#xD;
His strength had collapsed, but not so his 1&#xD;
power of command. There was something 1&#xD;
compelling to obedience in the imperious&#xD;
tones; and, admonished partly by them,&#xD;
partly by his own increasing faintness, the&#xD;
young miner kept on.&#xD;
It was lucky for Hugh Churchill that he C&#xD;
did so. Scarcely had he passed the opening t&#xD;
when there came another heavy&#xD;
closing it behind him, fall of earth, 5&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.                ti&#xD;
ROLAND TYnnELL's last sight - the last, ti&#xD;
he fancied, that he should ever have of tI&#xD;
worldly things-was of that falling barrier N&#xD;
which shut him, in poisonous darkness, from h&#xD;
the sights and sounds of men. After that, he e~&#xD;
knew nothing more.                      b4&#xD;
He knew nothing of the sensation which di&#xD;
the news of his entombment made, nor how&#xD;
Mr. Beresford himself rushed down into the tli&#xD;
mine, nor how volunteers flocked to the work bc&#xD;
of his rescue, nor yet how zealously the me~ gr&#xD;
&#xD;
VENDETTA.&#xD;
labored to save him who had only a little&#xD;
before denounced them as cowards.&#xD;
But when Margaret Churchill, who was&#xD;
kneeling by her unconscious yet living broth.&#xD;
er, heard the news, she uttered a cry which&#xD;
those around her never forgot.&#xD;
"It is my fault!" she cried. "it is my&#xD;
fault! Urged him to go! I begged him to&#xD;
save Hugh! But I never feared this-I never&#xD;
thought that he would give his own Iife-O&#xD;
my God! what have I done!"&#xD;
It was easier to ask than to answer. The&#xD;
men below worked with a will on the fallen&#xD;
earth, which, being light, gave way readily to&#xD;
their shovels; but not one of them dared to&#xD;
hope that they would find Tyrrell alive. They&#xD;
knew too well the terrible power of the agent&#xD;
at work w~thin.&#xD;
"I don't think there's more than a shadow&#xD;
of a chance for the poor fellow," the superin-&#xD;
tendent said. "But we can only do for him&#xD;
what he did for Churchill -give him the&#xD;
benefit of that.-So work away, for God's&#xD;
sake, boys! every second of time counts&#xD;
against him."&#xD;
They knew that as well as the speaker&#xD;
~lid, and scarcely needed to be urged to ex-&#xD;
pedition. They worked as they had seldom,&#xD;
3ven in their stalwart lives of labor, worked&#xD;
before. Whether it was merely the universal&#xD;
zuman sympathy for human suffering-which&#xD;
~t such times strikes a magnetic chord to&#xD;
nake men brothers-or whether they were&#xD;
noved to special interest by the courage of&#xD;
he gallant gentleman dying within, no one&#xD;
ould tell. Assuredly they could n~t have&#xD;
old themselves. People accustomed to&#xD;
analyzing motives do not pause for such a&#xD;
process at moments of supreme excitement.&#xD;
till less are those who have never done such&#xD;
thing likely to choose such a time to begin.&#xD;
did not matter what sentiment it was, when&#xD;
~e heart sent force enough into those sturdy&#xD;
rms to demolish in a very short time-.&#xD;
iough time which seemed horribly long to&#xD;
ic passive lookers-on-the awful tomb of&#xD;
nature's fashioning. Then they found that&#xD;
a was lying immediately beyond the fallen&#xD;
~rth, and that the two lanterns which had&#xD;
~en left were still burning, though very&#xD;
mly.&#xD;
Drawn forth into purer air, they thought&#xD;
icy detected signs of life; but no one could&#xD;
sure of this. It was true there was some&#xD;
ound of hope in the fact that the lights&#xD;

5S                  HUGH'S VENDETTA.                                                      HUGH'S VENDETTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
had not been totally extinguished, and that&#xD;
he had not been buried much more than fif-&#xD;
teen or twenty minutes; but no man was&#xD;
bold enough to say, "He will live!" nor even&#xD;
"He is alive!"&#xD;
"Get him up into the hands of the doctors&#xD;
as quick as possible," Mr. Beresford said.&#xD;
"Good Heavens! what a piece of work this&#xD;
has been!"&#xD;
Up from the under-world into the light&#xD;
of God's blessed sky he was accordingly&#xD;
taken-a far more deathly-seeming man than&#xD;
Hugh Churchill had been, or even than those&#xD;
poor victims drawn forth, stone-dead, from&#xD;
beneath the avalanche of fallen earth. Un-&#xD;
d~r the influence of powerful restoratives,&#xD;
Churchill was beginning to revival a little,&#xD;
and to comprehend, in a measure~Where he&#xD;
was and what had happened.&#xD;
"Tyrrell l" he repeated, faintly, as he&#xD;
heard the name passing from lip to lip&#xD;
around him, for just at that moment Tyrrell&#xD;
was brought forth, and laid down, as it&#xD;
chanced, almost exactly at the feet of the&#xD;
brother and sister. To the surprise of all&#xD;
present, Margaret Churchill rose at once,&#xD;
and, going to his side, knelt down by him;&#xD;
gazing into the pallid face, feeling the pulse-&#xD;
less hands.&#xD;
"He has given his life for yours, Hugh,"&#xD;
she said, at last, looking up at her bewil-&#xD;
dered brother, with a ghastly smile on her&#xD;
quivering lips. "I think you may be satis-&#xD;
fied that your vendetta is ended now."&#xD;
He had, indeed, given his life so far as&#xD;
the will to do so went, but not as far as the&#xD;
actual fact was concerned. The physicians,&#xD;
who now came up, told Margaret that he was&#xD;
still alive. "He has wonderful vital force,"&#xD;
they said, "and it has enabled him to sur-&#xD;
vive an ordeal that would have killed a&#xD;
weaker man. But he is not out of danger&#xD;
yet. He may never recover consciousness,&#xD;
or, if he does, an attack of illness may prob-&#xD;
ably follow. We will apply all possible re-&#xD;
storatives, and then he should be taken away&#xD;
from here at once. Does anybody know&#xD;
where his lodgings are? The Tyrrell house&#xD;
was rented last week."&#xD;
Margaret knew where those lodgings were,&#xD;
but she held her peace as the men around&#xD;
shook their heads and disclaimed any knowl-&#xD;
edge of Mr. Tyrrell's place of abode. "Never&#xD;
mind, nbout that," she said, impatiently, to&#xD;
the doctor who had spoken "It is time&#xD;
&#xD;
enough to talk of where you will take him&#xD;
when he is ready to be taken anywhere."&#xD;
This was true enough. The process of&#xD;
restoring him, therefore, went on for some&#xD;
time at the mouth of the fatal shaft, with&#xD;
men and women of all kinds looking on-&#xD;
grief and death present in their most awful&#xD;
forms - and the petty, commonplace world&#xD;
thrusting itself forward now and then in the&#xD;
person of some newspaper reporter, who,&#xD;
having been spared from 'work on the flood&#xD;
to chronicle this new horror, came up to&#xD;
question the miners, the officials, the doctors,&#xD;
the half-restored victims-anybody and every-&#xD;
body, without regard to time or place.&#xD;
After a while, the physicians seemed to&#xD;
agree that Tyrrell would very likely recover.&#xD;
"He will not come to himself for some time&#xD;
yct," they said; "but, with the liberal&#xD;
aid of restoratives and stimulants, he'll do&#xD;
now."&#xD;
It was after this decision that Margaret,&#xD;
who had, meanwhile, exchanged a few words&#xD;
with Hugh, came forward and spoke.&#xD;
"Our cottage is near by," she said;&#xD;
"Mr. Tyrrell must be taken there. He&#xD;
risked his life to save my brother, and I&#xD;
should never forgive myself if I let him&#xD;
pass out of my sight until he is again re-&#xD;
stored to health."&#xD;
She announced this determination with so&#xD;
much quiet firmness and dignity that no one&#xD;
gainsayed her. Indeed, nobody had any right&#xD;
to do so. Roland Tyrrell had no relations,&#xD;
and but few friends, in Ridgeford. There&#xD;
was no one to oppose a rival claim for the&#xD;
possession of this weak, unconscious man,&#xD;
whose only sense of returning life was a ter-&#xD;
rible, giddy sickness.&#xD;
He did not know where they were taking&#xD;
him-in fact, he didn't care. As in a dream,&#xD;
he was aware that people came and went&#xD;
about him; that masculine voices talked over&#xD;
him; that a gentle hand now and then touched&#xD;
him with the magic art of soothing which some&#xD;
women possess; and that, finally, he lapsed&#xD;
into a sleep too deep even for such dreams as&#xD;
these.&#xD;
When he awoke, he felt as bewildered as&#xD;
Margaret had been on her awaking under&#xD;
somewhat similar circumstances. He could&#xD;
not remember for some time what had hap.&#xD;
pened, nor why he felt so weak and faint.&#xD;
Even when he mastered his recollection-up&#xD;
to the point of the falling earth in the mine-&#xD;
&#xD;
he could not imagine how he had been trans-&#xD;
ported from that prison, dreary and hopeless&#xD;
as Dante's hell, to this boudoir-like chamber,&#xD;
with its dainty furniture and picture-hung&#xD;
walls.&#xD;
At last, however, he gave up the effort of&#xD;
fatiguing his brain with conjectures, and de-&#xD;
cided to wait patiently for an explanation of&#xD;
the mystery. As if to reward his philosophy,&#xD;
it was not long before it came. The handle&#xD;
of the door turned softly, the door itself&#xD;
opened cautiously, and he heard a voice,&#xD;
which he would have recognized among ten&#xD;
thousand, saying, in a subdued key:&#xD;
"Now take care and don't make a noise,&#xD;
Hugh. Go in very gently and tell me if he is&#xD;
still asleep."&#xD;
Hugh! Roland Tyrrell's dark eyes opened&#xD;
yet wider than they had done before at sound&#xD;
of that name, and it was those eyes which&#xD;
Churchill first encountered when he entered&#xD;
the room with elaborate caution.&#xD;
"By Jove!" he said, and evinced symp-&#xD;
toms of beating an immediate retreat.&#xD;
But Tyrrell frustrated this intention by&#xD;
lifting himself a little, and holding out the&#xD;
hand which he had once declared his inten-&#xD;
tion of never offering again to Hugh Churchill.&#xD;
"I am very glad to see you again alive&#xD;
and well," he said.&#xD;
The words were not very much, but the&#xD;
tone was a good deal, and touched Hugh by&#xD;
its evi(lent sincerity. He came forward and&#xD;
wrung the extended hand with an almost pain-&#xD;
ful force.&#xD;
"Do you think I don't know that I owe it&#xD;
to you?" he said. "I never thought to owe 4&#xD;
any thing-at least any thing more-to one I&#xD;
of your name, Mr. Tyrrell, but, despite my&#xD;
will, you have made me your debtor for my&#xD;
life."&#xD;
This did not sound like a very gracious&#xD;
acknowledgment, but perhaps Roland Tyrrell r&#xD;
understood it. At least he smiled slightly, a&#xD;
"Don't let the obligation weigh upon t&#xD;
you," he said. "Look upon it not as a debt&#xD;
incurred, but as a debt paid. I hope I should v&#xD;
have done the same for anybody, but I was a&#xD;
especially glad to do it for you. We got you i,&#xD;
out just in time," he Went on, "and now pray d&#xD;
tell me how they got me out, and what is the a&#xD;
matter with my head? It surges like a roll-&#xD;
ing sea whenever I move."&#xD;
Hughhavingsatisfi~d his curiosity on these tI&#xD;
points, and told him much that he himself v&#xD;
&#xD;
59&#xD;
&#xD;
only knew from the report of others, Tyrrell&#xD;
next inquired where he was.&#xD;
"It can't be," he said, remembering the&#xD;
sound of Margaret's voice, "that I am in&#xD;
b'our house."&#xD;
"My sister thought it only fair that she&#xD;
should return your hospitality," Hugh said,&#xD;
I thinking to turn off the matter with a jest.&#xD;
''Seriously, you did not think that we were&#xD;
I going to send you to a hospital or a boarding-&#xD;
house when you had just risked-yes~ and by&#xD;
Jove! came within an inch of losing-your&#xD;
life to save mine?" he added, a little indig-&#xD;
nantly.&#xD;
"I-upon my honor, I never thought of&#xD;
it at all," Tyrrell answered. "My head-con-&#xD;
found it !-had not been in much of a condi-&#xD;
tion for thinking. But it is very good, very&#xD;
kind of you to have me here."&#xD;
"If it had not been for you, I should not&#xD;
be here," Hugh said, bluntly. "I generally&#xD;
try to pay my debts-after a fashion, at least.&#xD;
Oh, I had quite forgotten!" as a knock at&#xD;
the door was followed by the entrance of a&#xD;
small servant and a breakfast-tray, "Mar-&#xD;
garet wants to know if you will be well&#xD;
enough to come down after you have had&#xD;
your breakfast. There's a couch in the par-&#xD;
lor where you can be comfortable, and you'll&#xD;
find it dull up here, for I muSt go over to the&#xD;
mines.&#xD;
"Of course I will come down," said Tyr-&#xD;
rell. "What is the matter with me? I am not&#xD;
sick."&#xD;
"A man can't inhale mephitic air with&#xD;
[mpunity," Hugh answered. "It will be sev-&#xD;
~ral days before you are all right agai4. I&#xD;
iad a turn with it once, but not like this."&#xD;
Mr. Tyrrell found, indeed, that a man&#xD;
,ould not inhale mephitic air with impunity&#xD;
rhen he attempted to dress at a later hour&#xD;
~f the morning, and, at a still later period, to&#xD;
nake his way down-stairs, tempted beyond&#xD;
II prudence by the thought of that couch in&#xD;
he parlor where Margaret awaited him.&#xD;
As he descended slowly, clutching ncr-&#xD;
ously at the balustrade, and feeling so ab-&#xD;
urd that he hoped devoutly no servant was&#xD;
a ambush to spy upon his erratic motions, a&#xD;
oor below opened, and Miss Churchill her-&#xD;
elf stepped into the hall.&#xD;
"Is that you, Mr. Tyrrell ?" she said,&#xD;
lining her bright face upward. "Oh, how&#xD;

She ran up to meet him, and insisted on&#xD;
his leaning on her.&#xD;
"I should have kept Hugh for this ser-&#xD;
vice," she said, laughing. "He would have&#xD;
made an excellent support, but I serve as a&#xD;
crutch. I am a good height for a crutch, am&#xD;
met?"&#xD;
"You are good for every thing," he said,&#xD;
gratefully. "How kind it was of you to&#xD;
bring me here I"&#xD;
"Why, where else should you have&#xD;
gone?" she asked. "After all you have suf-&#xD;
fered for Hugh, is it not very little to bring&#xD;
you here and nurse you well?"&#xD;
"I hope I shall not need any nursing."&#xD;
"You see I have made elaborate prepara-&#xD;
tions, nt least."&#xD;
She led him into the parlor as she~poke&#xD;
-that same parlor which he had entered&#xD;
once before in the dusk of the gloaming-&#xD;
and where a broad, low couch was wheeled&#xD;
before the fire, with cushions piled on it, and&#xD;
books and papers near.&#xD;
"If you want to read an authentic ac-&#xD;
count of your heroism, there is the morning's&#xD;
Post," she said, with a smile, as (rather&#xD;
against his will) she made him lie down.&#xD;
"Or shall I read it to you? Hugh says I&#xD;
read very weU. and I was taught early to&#xD;
mind my commas and stops."&#xD;
"I would much rather hear you talk," he&#xD;
said, looking at the chair from which she had&#xD;
plainly risen at the sound of his step. "I&#xD;
can't help thinking that I am dreaming. This&#xD;
is far too good to be true."&#xD;
"God knows if anybody had prophesied&#xD;
it to me this time yesterday l should have&#xD;
thought that it was far too good to be true,"&#xD;
she said, looking at him with quick-rising&#xD;
tears quenching the laughter in her brown&#xD;
eyes. Then, before he could conceive what&#xD;
she meant to do, she came and knelt down&#xD;
by his couch, laying her two soft hands over&#xD;
one of his.&#xD;
"OMr. Tyrrell," she said, "I know that&#xD;
brave men rarely like to be praised or thanked&#xD;
for their noble deeds; but I cannot keep si-&#xD;
lence. I must-I wilt thank you for giving&#xD;
Hugh back to me; for counting your own&#xD;
life as nothing in comparison to his; for dar-&#xD;
ing a danger from which any man might well&#xD;
have shrunk, and for-for-oh, for proving to&#xD;
everybody that you are as brave and gener-&#xD;
ous as Inlways knew you were!"&#xD;
Her eyes glowed, her cheeks flushed, her&#xD;
&#xD;
HUGH'S&#xD;
&#xD;
iiNDETTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
lips quivered. Nobody could have doubted&#xD;
how entirely from her heart those eager words&#xD;
came. Tyrrell-"--who usually had enough of&#xD;
that simplicity which accompanies true cour-&#xD;
age not to like to hear his own achievements&#xD;
praised-would have been something more or&#xD;
less than man if, in this instance, he had not&#xD;
listened with more than pleasure. He tried&#xD;
to stop her, but she would not be stopped.&#xD;
The generous heart was no niggard, and&#xD;
meant to utter all it felt - for Margaret&#xD;
Churchill was not a woman to do things by&#xD;
halves.&#xD;
"Do not talk to me like this," he said at&#xD;
last. "I am not used to such sweet flattery.&#xD;
You know-or you ought to know-that I&#xD;
would count any loss or suffering a positive&#xD;
gain which enabled me to serve you. Fate&#xD;
has been kind to me in giving me this op-&#xD;
portunity. I alone, therefore, am its debtor.&#xD;
Hence, all is said."&#xD;
"No; all is not said," she answered, im-&#xD;
petuously. "Indeed "-with smiles brimming&#xD;
up into her eyes again, like the April mood of&#xD;
a child-" I really have not an idea when all&#xD;
wilt be said. Not in a long, very long while,&#xD;
I am sure."&#xD;
"You don't mean that you are going to&#xD;
talk for a very long while about me?" he&#xD;
asked, slightly dismayed.&#xD;
"Yes, about you-and a little, perhaps,&#xD;
about Hugh. Do you know, Mr. Tyrrell, that&#xD;
if I am the happiest woman in the world this&#xD;
morning, it is because I was the most wr.etch~&#xD;
ed yesterday morning? What should I have&#xD;
done if Hugh had been brought back to&#xD;
me as many another woman's best-beloved&#xD;
was brought back to her? How should I&#xD;
ever have forgiven myself if you had cast&#xD;
your life away in the errand npon which I&#xD;
had been selfish enough to send you?"&#xD;
"If you had not sent me, I should have&#xD;
gone," he said. "This life of mine is not&#xD;
worth so much that I would not freely have&#xD;
given it to save the son of Albert Churchill-&#xD;
your brother, Margaret."&#xD;
When he called her Margaret, she colored&#xD;
and drew back. Perhaps she did not ap-&#xD;
prove of so much familiarity, and thought&#xD;
that she had better regain the safer distance&#xD;
of her chair. But Tyrrell's hands closed over&#xD;
hers, and she was captive.&#xD;
"Don't go," l~e said, imploringly. "I re-&#xD;
peat that I am sure this must be a dream;&#xD;
but, when a man has worked long and wean-&#xD;
&#xD;
ly, do not grudge him one short hour of happi&#xD;
ness! You talk of yesterday morning ani&#xD;
of this morning. Think of the contrast ti&#xD;
mel Did I not believe then that I was part&#xD;
ing from you forever? Yet here I am in th~&#xD;
same room where you met me so coldly, am&#xD;
yet where you spoke such brave, gentle words&#xD;
one month ago!"&#xD;
"Ah, but you know you are dreaming!'&#xD;
she said, smiling.&#xD;
"Am I?" he said, with sudden passion~&#xD;
"Then God knows such a dream is worth&#xD;
more than all my waking life besides! Yel&#xD;
it is a good thing to be alive!" he went on a&#xD;
little wistfully. "It is a good thing to come&#xD;
hack to the earth which is brightened by such&#xD;
a face as yours. But, 0 Margaret! what shall&#xD;
I do when that face goes out of my life&#xD;
again?"&#xD;
"it need not go, unless you desire it,"&#xD;
she answered, gently. "I told you yesterday&#xD;
that it was impossible we could be friends. I&#xD;
tell you now that we shall be proud and happy&#xD;
to claim you as a friend-if you will let us&#xD;
do so,"&#xD;
" We? Do you mean your brother as well&#xD;
as yourself?"&#xD;
"Yes, I speak for Hugh as for myself.&#xD;
'We Churchills always think alike on a point&#xD;
of honor,"' she said, quoting Hugh's words,&#xD;
half proudly. "You have conquered him,&#xD;
Mr. Tyrrell; and I can assure you that, when&#xD;
Hugh is conquered once, he~ is conquered for&#xD;
good."&#xD;
"And Hugh's sister, when she is conquered&#xD;
once, is she conquered for good?"&#xD;
"Always," she answered, looking at him&#xD;
with her frank, loyal eyes. "You may count&#xD;
Margaret Churchill your friend for life."&#xD;
"Ah, but I fear I shall never be content&#xD;
with Margaret Churchill as my friend for life,"&#xD;
he said. "She must be something nearer and&#xD;
dearer to me than that-or else not so much.&#xD;
Her kindness-even such kindness as this-is&#xD;
too dangerously sweet if I cannot hope for&#xD;
more. No, Margaret, it will not do," he&#xD;
went on, as he met her reproachful glance.&#xD;
"I cannot play such an empty part as to talk&#xD;
of friendship with love burning at my heart.&#xD;
I know you think lam i~ngenerous to speak&#xD;
of this at a time when Cseem to have estab-&#xD;
lished a claim upon you; but I am sure you&#xD;
will do me the justice to believe that I have&#xD;
no desire to obtain from your gratitude what&#xD;
I could not win from your love."&#xD;
5&#xD;

VENDETTA.                              01&#xD;
"Yes, I acquit you of that," she said, in&#xD;
I a low voice. "But why not be content-"&#xD;
"With your friendship? That is asking&#xD;
a little too much of a man who has loved you&#xD;
with hopeless passion for five years, Marga-&#xD;
I ret. I see how it is," he went on, as she&#xD;
3 turned her face from him. "You waive the&#xD;
old enmity enough to admit me as a friend,&#xD;
but honor, pride, conscience-God only knows&#xD;
what-will not let you waive it enough to&#xD;
even think of a nearer tie."&#xD;
She did not speak, but, by an impatient&#xD;
gesture, she seemed to deny this interpreta-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Then it is I-the individual man, not&#xD;
the son of Henry Tyrrell-who have no pow-&#xD;
er to please, no hope to win you," he said,&#xD;
with a quick sigh. "Well, there are some&#xD;
things that come not at one's desire, and&#xD;
which no man is strong enough to win. The&#xD;
fancy of a woman's heart, they say, is one of&#xD;
these. But you might have let me think that&#xD;
it was the ~old vendetta, Margaret. You&#xD;
would have been none the poorer, and I&#xD;
much the richer for that consolation."&#xD;
"Did I say what it was?" she asked,&#xD;
suddenly flashing her face round upon him&#xD;
with impetuous passion burning on her cheeks&#xD;
and flooding her eyes. "Did I even-even&#xD;
say it was any thing?"&#xD;
"Margaret!" he cried.&#xD;
He sprang up, but, as he did so, she tore&#xD;
her hands from his grasp, and would have&#xD;
retreated if he had not caught her in his&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
"Let mc go, Mr. Tyrrell," she said. "This&#xD;
is not generous."&#xD;
"One word, Margaret," he said. "You&#xD;
must answer the question now which you did&#xD;
not answer yesterday. Tell me only this: if&#xD;
you and I had met as other people meet-no&#xD;
barrier of past bitterness between us-could&#xD;
you have learned to love me then? if you&#xD;
can only say 'Yes '-0 Margaret, trust me,&#xD;
no effort shall be wanting on my part that&#xD;
you may learn that lesson yet."&#xD;
He spoke with a passion that might have&#xD;
touched any woman's heart to the core, but&#xD;
Margaret Churchill only looked up in his face&#xD;
and laughed.&#xD;
"Do you think love is ever learned?" she&#xD;
asked. "If so, it must be an exotic, Mr.&#xD;
Tyrrell, which cannot be worth very much.&#xD;
I do not know, but it seems to me that the&#xD;
only love which is worth receiving-and doub-&#xD;

which comes as unfettered and untaught (I eager, anxious pleading of his face made her&#xD;
had almost said unsought), as the free sun- answer him without further prevarication:&#xD;
'light from heaven."                        " That love," she said, softly, "I have&#xD;
" And that love, Margaret ?"          always given you."&#xD;
&#xD;
I-.&#xD;
'c TELEN, is it possible that you have&#xD;
LJ.not finished that letter yet ?"&#xD;
It was a weary and slightly-plaintive voice&#xD;
that came from one of the deep bay-windows&#xD;
of the library at Trefalden Manor, and made&#xD;
the girl addressed raise -her head quickly&#xD;
from the table over which she was bend-.&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
" Why, Rafe !1" she said, with a little&#xD;
start ; then added, in an ordinary tone: " I&#xD;
did not know that you were there, dear. Yes,&#xD;
I will finish in a minute. But it is such an&#xD;
important letter that I must be specially care-&#xD;
ful about it, you know." '&#xD;
"No, I don't know," responded the same&#xD;
voice, this time a little perversely. " I can't&#xD;
see any reason why you should be specially&#xD;
careful in addressing Miss Oheriton."&#xD;
" Consider Miss Cheriton in the light of&#xD;
Harry'sfancie-is there no reason, then ? "&#xD;
" Less than ever, if that be possible."&#xD;
" Well, I have not time to argue with you&#xD;
now. I must finish the letter and take it to&#xD;
Aunt Maida for inspection. After that, I&#xD;
shall be at your service."  *.&#xD;
Silence after tbis-silence only disturbed&#xD;
by the movement of Helen's pen across the&#xD;
paper, and the soft swaying of the' green&#xD;
boughs that drooped before the open window.&#xD;
A few stray gleams .of gunshine only found&#xD;
admittance through the jealous curtain of&#xD;
shade, and-danced and flickered about-some&#xD;
on the book-lined walls, some on the polished&#xD;
floor - as the summer breeze capriciously&#xD;
&#xD;
tossed the rustling leaves outside. One of&#xD;
these golden intruders fell across the girl's&#xD;
white dress, danced to and fro across her pa-&#xD;
per, and seemed to linger tenderly over the&#xD;
slender hand as she made a final flourish of&#xD;
her pen at the bottom of the page, and then&#xD;
pushed it from her.&#xD;
When she lifted her face it looked pale&#xD;
and somewhat weary. Yet, even with these&#xD;
disadvantages, the summer sunshine might&#xD;
have travelled far before it would have found&#xD;
a lovelier face on which to rest. The com-&#xD;
plexion was stainless of color as marble, the&#xD;
features were exquisitely delicate, the eyes&#xD;
large and dark, and the hair of that rich, red&#xD;
gold which is at once the rarest and most&#xD;
beautiful tint known to Nature or to art.&#xD;
There was something exceedingly quaint in&#xD;
her style of beauty; and, notwithstanding&#xD;
that one glance at her face might have proved&#xD;
to the dullest comprehension that here was&#xD;
one of the exceptional women who could say&#xD;
with Cleopatra-&#xD;
" Like the moon, I make&#xD;
SThe ever-shifting current of the blood,&#xD;
According to my humor, ebb and flow "-&#xD;
there was also a childlike simplicity and&#xD;
grace about her which made a strange and&#xD;
attractive contrast to her extraordinary beau-&#xD;
ty. Indeed, the full revelation of this beauty&#xD;
had yet to come to Helen Trefalden. As she&#xD;
stood up now, and, pushing back her hair with&#xD;
a tired-gesture, looked into a large mirror op-&#xD;
posite, she knew, of course-she would have&#xD;
been blind if she had not known-what rare&#xD;
loveliness was imaged there. But she real-&#xD;

&#xD;
ized no more than the merest child what a&#xD;
potent power in the world-a power setting&#xD;
at defiance all other powers-such loveliness&#xD;
could be made.&#xD;
" Rafe, dear," she said, " on considera-,&#xD;
tion, I won't take this letter to Aunt Maida&#xD;
just now. She is probably asleep, and I&#xD;
should only disturb hr. Shall I bring the&#xD;
German grammar, an et us study our lesson&#xD;

"Not tb.day," was the answer. "It is&#xD;
too warm for German. In fact, I think we&#xD;
have fagged away at it long enough. Come&#xD;
here-let us be idle and talk." -&#xD;
Helen obeyed, but it was rather slowly.&#xD;
Her lagging step, and a slight contraction of&#xD;
the brows, seemed to indicate that she would&#xD;
rather have been left alone ; but still she&#xD;
summoned a smile as she drew back the cu.-&#xD;
tains and faced a small, delicate cripple-boy&#xD;
or man, it was bard to say which-who lay&#xD;
on a couch under the open window,.&#xD;
"Well," she said, "here I am. What&#xD;
Millyo have ?" .&#xD;
" Sit down," he said. "I want to look at&#xD;
you.&#xD;
yoShe sat down without any demur, and re-&#xD;
turned the gaze which he bent on her. Yet&#xD;
this was no trifling thing to do, for many&#xD;
people found Rafe Trefalden's eyes exceed-&#xD;
ingly hard to meet. people, in especial, who&#xD;
had any thing to conceal, always grew un-&#xD;
comfortable when those bright, hazel eyes&#xD;
rested on them-eyes which looked as if they&#xD;
might have read, not only the face, but the&#xD;
heart and mind as well; whichrwere luminous&#xD;
with intellect, full of a certain satirical hu-&#xD;
mor, and sometimes (not always ) shining&#xD;
with a tender beauty which made his cousin&#xD;
think that he had not been ill-named Raphael,&#xD;
after the angel of God. Although he looked&#xD;
so young, he had reached the full years of&#xD;
manhood ; though, as far as practical useful.-&#xD;
ness went, manhood was to him at most only&#xD;
an empty name. He had been a cripple since&#xD;
early childhood. But for this, "he might&#xD;
have been any thing," his teachers always&#xD;
said ; and his parents-whose only other son&#xD;
was by no means -intellectually gifted-felt&#xD;
the disappointment so bitterly that it almost&#xD;
weaned their affection from the unconscious&#xD;
cause of it. There was no want of kindness,&#xD;
no want of tender and considerate care ; but&#xD;
there was a want of that golden sympathy&#xD;
without which human hearts shrivel and be-&#xD;
&#xD;
come like unto the dust beneath our feet.&#xD;
Into this state Rafe Trefalden was drifting&#xD;
when an influence which was to save him en-&#xD;
tered his life. He was fifteen when a young-&#xD;
er brother of his father died, leaving an insol-&#xD;
vent estate and an orphan child. The estate&#xD;
Mr. Trefalden handed over to the dead man's&#xD;
creditors ; the.'child he brought home and&#xD;
adopted into his own family. " As she grows&#xD;
older, she will be of great service to you," he&#xD;
said to his wife, who was a languid invalid ;&#xD;
and his prophecy was amply verified: for, as&#xD;
the little Helen grew older, she became vir-&#xD;
tually her aunt's right hand, doing every&#xD;
thing brightly and cheerfully which a paid&#xD;
companion would have done as a matter of&#xD;
taskwork and duty.' But, above all, she was&#xD;
Rafe's friend, companion, pupil, and sister.&#xD;
The affection between these two was singu-.&#xD;
larly touching in its depth and intensity.&#xD;
For ten years they had shared every feeling&#xD;
in common, until of late a slight cloud of re-&#xD;
serve had risen between them which Rafe&#xD;
was plainly determined should be dissipated&#xD;
now.&#xD;
" Helen," he said, quite abruptly, " of&#xD;
course nobody else could see it; but I see&#xD;
that you are suffering"&#xD;
Helen smiled-not brightly, nor yet sadly,&#xD;
but with an expression between the two.&#xD;
" Not much, dear," she said. " And you&#xD;
may trust me that it will soon be less."&#xD;
"It almost kills me to think that a man&#xD;
like that has power to make you suffer for a&#xD;
moment."&#xD;
"Don't blame him, Rafe," she said, with a'&#xD;
sudden mixture of gentleness and contempt.&#xD;
" He is weak, you know, and easily swayed by&#xD;
whatever face is near him. Then it would&#xD;
-have been hard if he had been bound by a&#xD;
boy and girl fancy. He went into the world&#xD;
and forgot it. I stayed here and remembered&#xD;
it. That is all."&#xD;
" He is the first Trefalden whom I ever&#xD;
knew or heard of without a sense of honor,"&#xD;
said Rafe, bitterly. 4&#xD;
"That is where you do him injustice,"&#xD;
said Helen, quickly. " I am sure he does not&#xD;
even imagine that 'he was in any manner&#xD;
bound to mec. Don't you know how different-&#xD;
ly a man of the world looks at these things ?&#xD;
I assure you I do not blame any thing but my&#xD;
own folly. I understand all the rest so&#xD;
well."&#xD;

last, and all impressions faded quickly from&#xD;
his mind.&#xD;
"By Jove, it is lovely 1" he said. "I&#xD;
don't believe' there's a prettier place in the&#xD;
country Rafe, I never saw any thing to&#xD;
equal it."&#xD;
"It is certainly lovely," said Rafe, to&#xD;
whom. the Manor was, next to Helen, the&#xD;
dearest thing in the world. "I di.d not know&#xD;
how it would strike a travelled gentleman like&#xD;
yourself," he went on, with an inflection of&#xD;
sarcasm, which his brother knew very well.&#xD;
"I am gratified to see that you appreciate&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"By George! nobody could help appreci.&#xD;
ating it," said Trefalden. "I don't think it&#xD;
could be improved. By.the.by, are any of&#xD;
the country neighbors worth cultivating P We&#xD;
shall need to be quite gay in the course of&#xD;
the next fortnight, you know." ~(Qminous si-&#xD;
lence on Rafe's part.) "Miss Cheriton would&#xD;
die of the vapors, if we condemned her to a&#xD;
family party all the time. Have any plans for&#xD;
her amusement been made?"&#xD;
"That is more than I can tell you. I&#xD;
have made none. I won't answer for the&#xD;
others."&#xD;
"You see she leaves the gayest kind of&#xD;
a life in the city, to come down here; and&#xD;
so, of course- By Jove, Rafe! who is&#xD;
that?"&#xD;
"Have you managed to forget Helen as&#xD;
well as the Manor, in the course of two&#xD;
years P". asked Rafe, with not a little bitter.&#xD;
ness..&#xD;
But, for once, the bitterness escaped his&#xD;
brother's ear. He stood still and gazed in&#xD;
astonished admiration at the picture which&#xD;
a turn of the path disclosed to him. It was&#xD;
only Helen; but Helen was in herself a mar-&#xD;
vel, on that bright summer morning, standing&#xD;
among the roses like another I'rosel~pine. She&#xD;
did siot see the two young men, for her face&#xD;
was turned aside as she clipped right and left&#xD;
with her large garden-shears, and filled the&#xD;
basket which hung on her arm with roses of&#xD;
every, hue and kind. As they paused, she&#xD;
was in the act of reaching after a large bud&#xD;
which hung just above her head. Catching&#xD;
the bough, she sent a shower of glittering&#xD;
dew and perfumed petals down upon her face,&#xD;
but, in spite of both, broke off the coveted&#xD;
blossom triumphantly, and then, turning, all&#xD;
in a glow, faced her cousins.&#xD;
Rafe, who watched her nervously, was re-&#xD;
&#xD;
lived to see that she neither started nor&#xD;
turned pale. She looked a little surprised,&#xD;
then smiled, and advanced with outstretched&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Welcome hack, Harry," she said. "We&#xD;
began to fear that you had quite 1:orsaken&#xD;
us."&#xD;
"There was no danger of that," said Har-&#xD;
ry, a little breathlessly. "I am amazingly&#xD;
glad to get back," ,he went on, holding her&#xD;
hand, and gazing into her face with an admi-&#xD;
ration which enraged Rafe. "What have you&#xD;
been doing to yourself, Helen?" he cried, sud-&#xD;
denly. "You were not always as pretty as&#xD;
this, surely?"&#xD;
"One is not able to decide upon one's own&#xD;
looks," said Helen, smiling; "but I don't think&#xD;
I have improved much in these two years. In.&#xD;
deed, Aunt Maida says that I have decidedly&#xD;
goue off."&#xD;
"Mamma must be blind, then. - Rafe,&#xD;
don't you think that she has improved won-&#xD;
derfully?"&#xD;
But, before Rafe could reply, Helen inter.&#xD;
posed.&#xD;
"You ought to remember I have not been&#xD;
~accustomed to compliments since you went&#xD;
away. Besides, I can't stop to hear them&#xD;
now. Breakfast will be ready-I only came&#xD;
out for some roses to fill the vases."&#xD;
"And we only came out in search of you,"&#xD;
said Harry. "So we will go back now."&#xD;
Back accordingly they went-Rafe limp.'&#xD;
ing grimly along, while his brother's ready&#xD;
compliments flowed with a facility which&#xD;
proved an extensive practice in this branch&#xD;
of social accomplishment. With this, as with&#xD;
every thing else, however, there is a great&#xD;
deal in being inspired; and no better inspira-&#xD;
tion could have been asked than Helen's face,&#xD;
as it looked up at' her cousin. During all&#xD;
these years spent among women who were&#xD;
famous beauties and belles, Henry Trefalden&#xD;
had seen no face to comparewith it; and the&#xD;
realization of this fact came to him with an&#xD;
amazement too deep for words.&#xD;
Occasionally he had thought, with half-&#xD;
amused tenderness, of the pretty cousin far&#xD;
away in the green solitudes of the Manor, for&#xD;
whom he had once had a boy's sentimental&#xD;
fancy; but that' the pretty cousin was in&#xD;
reality such a woman as the one before him,&#xD;
had never for a moment occurred to his mind.&#xD;
He had forgotten her face as completely as&#xD;
he had forgotten to how much that aentimen-&#xD;

4&#xD;
&#xD;
tal fancy of which he thought so lightly had&#xD;
bound him. Such volatile, impressionable&#xD;
people ~re common enough in the world. No&#xD;
man would have stood more stanchly by a&#xD;
point of honor (understood as such) than&#xD;
Trefalden; but, what with a mind from which&#xD;
impressions were easily effaced, and a heart&#xD;
on which impressions were easily made, and&#xD;
a convenient habit of ignoring whatever&#xD;
chanced to be in the least degree disagree-&#xD;
able or embarrassing, he had managed to&#xD;
drift into a position which would have star-&#xD;
tled him if he could have seen it with-the&#xD;
eyes of his brother, for instance.&#xD;
Fortunately, however, we do not "see our-&#xD;
selves as others see us," and so we are spared&#xD;
some very shocking disclosures with regard&#xD;
to the opinion in which we are held by our&#xD;
friends and relatives. Trefalden was in the&#xD;
best possible spirits, the best possible humor&#xD;
with himself and everybody else, as he saun-&#xD;
tered along between his brother and his cous-&#xD;
in, both of whom were puzzled, and one of&#xD;
whom was indignant at his light unconscious-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
~LWhat does he mean?'~ thought Helen,&#xD;
wistfully. "Surely he has not forgotten-&#xD;
every thing!"&#xD;
"The insolent puppy!" thought Rafe.&#xD;
"He believes he can amuse himself with&#xD;
Helen, whenever he has nothing better to&#xD;
do."&#xD;
Trefalden, meanwhile, was talking in the&#xD;
gayest and, as he flattered himself, the hap.&#xD;
piest strain imaginable.&#xD;
"What delightful times we used to have,&#xD;
Helen!" he was saying. "They would be&#xD;
worth living over again, wouldn't they? Do&#xD;
you remember our rows on the river? By-&#xD;
the-by, is the boat in good order? I must&#xD;
certainly take you out again, and then we can&#xD;
talk over the old days at our leisure."&#xD;
"I don't think you would find much that&#xD;
was worth talking over," said Helen. "Old&#xD;
days do well enough for sentiment, you know,&#xD;
but not at all for active interest.-Ah! we&#xD;
a~e just in time. breakfastt is ready, and&#xD;
here comes Uncle George."&#xD;
Mr. Trefalden entered the dining - room&#xD;
door as the group of three made their ap-&#xD;
pearance through the window. He. was a&#xD;
handsome, middle aged gentleman, of ~ery&#xD;
reserved mannered, who shook hands with his&#xD;
son as if they had met the week before, and&#xD;
nodded to Rafe and Helen.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Glad to see you hack, Harry," he said.&#xD;
"I hope you mean to spend some time with&#xD;
us. The country's pleasant just now, and&#xD;
quite a relief from the city, I should think.&#xD;
I trust you left Miss Cheriton well?"&#xD;
"Quite well, thank you, sir," said Harry,&#xD;
who knew his father too well to feel at all&#xD;
chilled by this reception. "She sent her&#xD;
kind regards to my mother and yourself, and&#xD;
hopes to see you soon," he went on. "Her&#xD;
aunt and herself think of coming down next&#xD;
week."&#xD;
"Your mother is very much pleased with&#xD;
her letter," said Mr. Trefalden, as if thewhole&#xD;
affair was a matter of the most profound in-&#xD;
difference to him. "I believe she mentioned&#xD;
the 20th as the date on which she will leave&#xD;
the city-was it not, Helen?"&#xD;
During breakfast Mr. Henry Trefalden&#xD;
decidedly monopolized conversation, talking&#xD;
gayly of himself, his friends, and affairs, es-&#xD;
pecially his plans for the next few weeks, 4&#xD;
.propor of which he announced, in an off-hand&#xD;
kind of way, that "Latimer" was coming&#xD;
down to spend some time with him.&#xD;
Questioned regarding who Latimer might&#xD;
be, it transpired that this was a person whom&#xD;
not to know argued one's self unknown.&#xD;
"Is it possible you never heard of him?"&#xD;
Trefalden asked. '.' So much for human great-&#xD;
ness-and Latimer is* a very great man in his&#xD;
own circle."&#xD;
"Is it the Latimer of whom you used&#xD;
to talk when you were at college?" asked&#xD;
Helen.&#xD;
"The very same."&#xD;
"And in what respect has he become dis-&#xD;
tinguished?'~&#xD;
"In his profession, for one thing. Young&#xD;
as he is, he has already the reputation of&#xD;
being one of the ablest pleaders and more.&#xD;
brilliant speakers at the bar. :His intellect&#xD;
is said to he so keen that even the oldest&#xD;
lawyers quail before him."&#xD;
"I hope we shall not imitate their exam-&#xD;
ple," said Helen, laughing. "And is.j he&#xD;
equally a conquering hero in society?"&#xD;
"Equally so. In fact, he has been the&#xD;
rage for a season or. two; and any one who&#xD;
did not know him intimately could not have&#xD;
imagined that the indifferent hero 'of dinner~&#xD;
parties and balls was, at the same time, the&#xD;
hardest-working student possible to imagine.~&#xD;
In his profession he has an amount of energy&#xD;

ciety you would think that his sole aim in&#xD;
life was to kill time and avoid being bored."&#xD;
"He must be very affected."&#xD;
"No, for there's a certain charm about&#xD;
him with it all. Women, by the scores, fall&#xD;
in love with him; and it is only friendly to&#xD;
give you a hint to look after your own heart."&#xD;
"Thank you," said Helen, smiling. Then&#xD;
she rose from the table. "I must go to Aunt&#xD;
Maida now," she said. "I will send you&#xD;
word whether or not she feels well enough to&#xD;
see you this morning."&#xD;
"Bring inc word, please," said be, rising&#xD;
also, and walking with her into the ball.&#xD;
"Don't press mamma to see me, if she's not&#xD;
well enough," he went on. "You know 1 am&#xD;
good for a month at least. Indeed, I am not&#xD;
sure that I shall ever go away again. Every&#xD;
thing is so charming."&#xD;
"I am glad you think so," said she, qul.&#xD;
etly; "but our monotonous life would soon&#xD;
grow very tiresome to a fashionable gentle.&#xD;
man like yourself. If you support it with&#xD;
philosophy for a month, I shall be aston~&#xD;
ished."&#xD;
"That is because you don't know-"&#xD;
" What?" (as he paused.)&#xD;
"Oh! a good many things. Myself for&#xD;
one-yourself for another."&#xD;
"And Miss Cheriton for a third, no doubt.&#xD;
Well, I trust you may find us moderately en.&#xD;
pertaining. At least, we have every desire to&#xD;
be so."&#xD;
"And, with the desire, the power-not to&#xD;
be moderately entertaining, but to be danger-&#xD;
ously charming "-(adding, as he saw her col-&#xD;
or and draw back)-" 1 think 1 ought in eon-&#xD;

will wonder what keeps me."&#xD;
"And when shall I see you again?"&#xD;
~t dinner, probably."&#xD;
"Oh, no, no!" (imploringly.) "I shall&#xD;
smoke a cigar on the terrace, and wait for&#xD;
you-as I used to do. Pray, come, Helen; I&#xD;
have so much to talk to you about."&#xD;
"It is impossible for me to promise," said&#xD;
Helen, coldly. "Aunt Maida usually keeps&#xD;
me some time. Good-morning."&#xD;
"I shall certainly look for you, and wait&#xD;
for you," said he.&#xD;
&#xD;
ON'S RIVAL.&#xD;
But he looked and waited in vain. The&#xD;
morning passed, and no Helen came. Poor&#xD;
Helen! She was in her own room, fighting a&#xD;
battle with herself, of which that loiterer&#xD;
among the roses never even dreamed. His&#xD;
utter uncotisciousness was in a manner worse&#xD;
than if he fully realized all that he had done.&#xD;
"It is I who have been mistaken from first to&#xD;
last," she thought; and that bitter sense of&#xD;
having given her heart unasked-the most&#xD;
bitter in The world to a sensitive woman--&#xD;
rushed over her like a flood. She could only&#xD;
soothe itby recalling words and tones which&#xD;
Trefalden himself had entirely forgotten, but&#xD;
which would certainly have startled him rude-&#xD;
ly if they could have faced him instead of&#xD;
those pleasant visions which curled before&#xD;
him with the smoke of his cigar.&#xD;
II.&#xD;
DURING the next week, Helen had a diffi-&#xD;
cult and very trying part to play, for Trefal-&#xD;
den was one of the large class of men who&#xD;
always make love to the lips that are nearest,&#xD;
without any regard to ties which may bind&#xD;
them to lips farther off~ His patronizing fan-&#xD;
cy for his pretty cousin, his continual refer-&#xD;
ence to those past days of which he thought&#xD;
so lightly, and his sublime consciousness of&#xD;
the fact that she desired to avoid him, all con-&#xD;
spired to make this week something of a&#xD;
nightmare to the girl-so much of a night-&#xD;
mare, indeed, that she was heartily glad when&#xD;
th~ day appointed for Miss Cheriton's arrival&#xD;
drew near.&#xD;
Punctual, for once, to an appointed date,&#xD;
this young lady came-her aunt and her maid&#xD;
and her trunks and herself-creating a sensi-&#xD;
ble commotion in the Jfinnor, ~whieh had long&#xD;
been unused to such fashi~nableinciir5ion5.&#xD;
Being a beauty and a belle, Miss Cheriton&#xD;
was well used to creating a commotion, how-&#xD;
ever; and it is doubtful if she would have&#xD;
thought that her mission in life had been ac-&#xD;
complished without the ~ck4 and noise which&#xD;
invariably attended her steps. Her aunt was&#xD;
a wealthy and childless widow, who was chief&#xD;
among her loyal subjects, and whose indul-&#xD;
gent partiality was returned by the most op-&#xD;
pressive tyranny that can be imagined. "0&#xD;
Louise!" the poor ladywould say when un-&#xD;
usually ruthless demands were made upon&#xD;
her time, her patience, or her purse. But&#xD;
the force of expostulation never went further&#xD;
I than this, and Louise never failed to come off&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS CHERI'&#xD;
&#xD;
victor from any and every conflict that oc-&#xD;
curred. There had been some such faint&#xD;
show of resistance over this visit to Trefalden&#xD;
Manor. Mrs. Surrey had been opposed to it,&#xD;
but Louise had borne down all opposition in&#xD;
her imperious way. "If you dt~n't want to&#xD;
go, auntie, you need not, of course," she&#xD;
said; "but I'm going, you know." In this&#xD;
view of the ease, what could poor Mrs. Sur-&#xD;
rey do but go also? "You will be sorry,&#xD;
Louise, if you should not marry young Tre-&#xD;
falden, after all," she said; "and I know you&#xD;
too well to be certain you'll marry him until I&#xD;
see you at the altar." "I'm not at all certain&#xD;
myself;" returned Louise, carelessly; "but&#xD;
they say it is a beautiful old place, and I&#xD;
mean to go and see it'&#xD;
The beautiful old place was accordingly&#xD;
honored by this condescension, and roused&#xD;
by the tide of life that rushed into it. The&#xD;
sober drawing-room of the Manor scarcely&#xD;
seemed like itself; Helen thought, as she&#xD;
looked round, on the evening of Miss Cheri-&#xD;
ton's first appearance. Besides the family&#xD;
and the two newly-arrived guests, was a third&#xD;
stranger who had come down to the city in&#xD;
Miss Cheriton's train, or, at least, on the same&#xD;
train as that young lady. This was Harry's&#xD;
distinguished friend, Mr. Latimer.&#xD;
"If I had not been told that he was dis-&#xD;
tinguished, I should never have suspected&#xD;
it," said Helen, aside to Rafe.&#xD;
"Not at first, perhaps," the latter an-&#xD;
swered, "but afterward I think you would.&#xD;
He has more sense than I should have given&#xD;
the man whom Harry described, credit for.&#xD;
Look at his brow and at his eyes!"&#xD;
"But he is not handsome at al1~" said&#xD;
helen, halt dissppo'intcd. Certainly she was&#xD;
right. Mr. Latimer was not handsome -&#xD;
thoroughly high-bred and refined in appear-&#xD;
ance, but undoubtedly not gifted with any&#xD;
trump cards in the way of good looks. He&#xD;
was small and slender, with a thin, dark face,&#xD;
black hair, a heavy black mustache, and eyes 4&#xD;
that should have been black also, but wer~, I&#xD;
instead, of a deep violet blue, fringed by the&#xD;
longest and darkest of lashes - very hand-&#xD;
some eyes, and eyes that were singularly cx- -&#xD;
pressive, but, unfortunately, so near-sighted&#xD;
that he could not have recognized his own I&#xD;
mother at a distance of tea paces. He man- a&#xD;
aged, however, to discover something in Helen I&#xD;
which struck him as sufficiently attractive i~&#xD;
to induce him to cross the floor and make his a&#xD;
&#xD;
FON'S RIVAL.                           69&#xD;
first effort toward cultivating her acquaint-&#xD;
ance.&#xD;
"Won't the beautiful evening tempt you&#xD;
to follow Miss Cheriton's example and go out&#xD;
on the terrace, Miss Trefalden?" he asked.&#xD;
"Miss Cheriton is a stranger, sand has&#xD;
been taken out to admire the view," an-&#xD;
swered Helen, smiling. "You can imagine&#xD;
that it would not have the merit of novelty&#xD;
to me."&#xD;
"But I am a stranger, too, and, though&#xD;
views are mostly of small importance to rae,&#xD;
owing to my infirmity of vision, still I like to&#xD;
see what can be seen. Perhaps, however"&#xD;
(noticing that she hesitated), "you don't feel&#xD;
inclined to play cicerone~"&#xD;
"Indeed, yes. 1 am too fond of the Manor&#xD;
not to be fond also of showing it ofl'.-Rafe,&#xD;
will you come?"&#xD;
Mr. Latimer courteously seconded this re-&#xD;
quest; but Rafe had sufficient discretion to&#xD;
excuse himself on the score of dew; so the&#xD;
others went off alone. The soft, fragrant&#xD;
evening seemed to be holding the world in a&#xD;
spell of beauty when they came out- the&#xD;
west was still glowing, and Venus alone was&#xD;
visible, holding her court with all the clear&#xD;
heaven to herself; above the golden fringe of&#xD;
sunset clouds.&#xD;
"It is rather too late for distant effects,"&#xD;
said Latimer, "but every thing near at hand&#xD;
is lovely. What an exquisite old place! Ivy&#xD;
and roses, and-and, as 1 live, a bed of lilies!&#xD;
Lilies are one of the few things that still re-&#xD;
tain the aroma of youth for znc-l mean the&#xD;
aroma that every thng beautiful has fDr us&#xD;
in youth. Miss Trefalden, may I have a&#xD;
1i1j~' ~"&#xD;
"As many as you like, Mr. Latimer,1' said&#xD;
Helen, putting out her hand with a smile.&#xD;
She broke off one of the tall flowers, and, as&#xD;
she turned and held it toward him, Latimer&#xD;
rlm~st caught his breath. At that moment,&#xD;
~ie could liken her to nothing save the Angel&#xD;
)f the Annunciation. The slender, stately&#xD;
Igure, dressed in pure white, stood 4~ined&#xD;
Against the golden background of the western&#xD;
ky, and the whole scene, with its accessories&#xD;
-the hair which seemed to make a halo of&#xD;
;lory about her head, the stainless lily in her&#xD;
iand-stamped themselves on his memory,&#xD;

"Does not this suit you?" asked Helen,&#xD;
who saw his hesitation, but had not vanity&#xD;
enough to suspect its cause.&#xD;
"No other one could suit me half as well&#xD;
as the one you have been kind enough to&#xD;
choose for me," he answered, taking it as he&#xD;
spoke. "Now that I have it, it is like many&#xD;
another good gift of earth," he added, philo-&#xD;
sophically-" rather cumbersome and difficult&#xD;
to dispose of. What shall I do with it, Miss&#xD;
Trefalden? It is rather large for my button-&#xD;
hole, don't you think so?"&#xD;
"I'm afraid I must candidly say that I do.&#xD;
Suppose you give It tome if you are tired of&#xD;
it.~ it will do for my hair."&#xD;
"I will give it on one condition."&#xD;
"What is that?"&#xD;
"That I may claim it again after you have&#xD;
worn it."&#xD;
"There must certainly be sometbh~g very&#xD;
light about me," thought poor Helen. "Here&#xD;
is another man trying to amuse himself by&#xD;
paying me foolish compliments." Said she&#xD;
aloud, with very graceful dignity, "I'm afraid&#xD;
you forget how many other lilies there are&#xD;
near at hand, Mr Latimer."&#xD;
"For yourself, or for me?"&#xD;
"For either or both. For me, that I may&#xD;
be quite independent of such an arbitrary&#xD;
condition-for you, that you may appreciate&#xD;
how much better fresh lilies are than faded&#xD;
ones."&#xD;
"Suppose I have a fancy to prefer a faded&#xD;
one?"&#xD;
"I decline to suppose any thing of the&#xD;
kind. You won't force me to the conclusion&#xD;
that you arc a very foolish person, and that&#xD;
would be foolish, you know."&#xD;
"Genius has its eccentricities," said Lati-&#xD;
mer, gravely. "Only shallow minds call them&#xD;
folly, and I'm sure you won't force me to&#xD;
the conclusion that you have a shallow&#xD;
mind."&#xD;
"I should be very sorry to do so, certain-&#xD;
ly,1' said Helen; laughing.&#xD;
J~is manner they broke the ice, and&#xD;
advanced toward acquaintance. From the&#xD;
first, there was an attraction between them-.--&#xD;
a bond of sympathy, which, in the matter of&#xD;
friendship, is worth every thing else in the&#xD;
world put together. It was not so muih&#xD;
Helen's rare beauty that struck Latimer, as&#xD;
the sweet, gracious charm of a character&#xD;
which was in truth one of the most thorough-&#xD;
ly sympathetic that he had ever encountered.&#xD;
&#xD;
ON'S RIVAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
He was a man of keen observation-a man&#xD;
who could read volumes where another would&#xD;
not decipher a line-but it was not so much&#xD;
observation as a certain instinct which drew&#xD;
him toward this girl-this fair, stainless lily,&#xD;
whom Henry Trefalden had once possessed,&#xD;
and cast aside for a pretty French rose of time&#xD;
finest artificial make.&#xD;
"Here is our best view," said Helen, paus-&#xD;
ing at an angle of the terrace which over-&#xD;
looked the rolling country for a mile or two&#xD;
around. "It is almost too late to see it now;&#xD;
but, in daylight-"&#xD;
"In daylight it must be lovely," said Lat-&#xD;
liner, who could barely see three yards be-&#xD;
fore him. "We will certainly come out here&#xD;
to-morrow and enjoy it. Then we can-I beg&#xD;
pardon" (as a fan lightly tapped his arm)-&#xD;
"is that you, Miss Cheriton?"&#xD;
"Don't beg pardon for not seeing me,"&#xD;
said a silvery voice, which made Helen start&#xD;
in turn. "When two people are so well en-&#xD;
tertained, they don't, as a general rule, see&#xD;
anybody but themselves. Did I hear you&#xD;
really professing to admire the scenery?"&#xD;
"I usually admire as much of it as I can&#xD;
see-which is not very much," said he. "We&#xD;
can afford to be incredulous of beauties that&#xD;
we have never seen."&#xD;
"And of some which we do see-is it not&#xD;
so? I don't mean any thing disrespectful to&#xD;
the country, but I frankly confess that I much&#xD;
prefer animate to inanimate creation-men&#xD;
and women to trees and stones.-Miss Tre-&#xD;
falden, you look quite shocked. If we are to&#xD;
get on at all, I 'must give you warning that&#xD;
my education has heen of the most frivolous&#xD;
kind. I am not superior a bit-am I, Mr.&#xD;
Latimer? I don't care for any thing in the&#xD;
world except the German and flirtation-do I,&#xD;
Mr. Trefalden?"&#xD;
Said Mr. Latimer: "When a lady abuses&#xD;
herself; it is a fixed article of my creed never&#xD;
to contradict' her."&#xD;
Said Trefalden: "Miss Cheriton can afford&#xD;
to begin an acquaintance by attempting to&#xD;
depreciate herself." Then, in a lower and&#xD;
more sentimental tone, "You care for a few&#xD;
thing~ in the world besides the German and&#xD;
flirtation, I am sure.&#xD;
"Yourself being one, of course," said she,&#xD;
with a laugh. "Pray don't be~ too sure of&#xD;
that-too much confidence is always unwise.&#xD;
-But Miss Trefalden does not say a word. I&#xD;
think I have certainly shocked her."&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS CHERITON'S RIVAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Does candor ever shock us?" aske&#xD;
Helen. "Don't we rather admirfi it?"&#xD;
"When it suits us-perhaps so. Genci&#xD;
ally, however, it is very disagreeable. If Mi&#xD;
Latinser, for example, were to tell me at thi&#xD;
moment what he thinks of me, I am sure&#xD;
should find it very disagreeable."&#xD;
"May I test that, Miss Cheriton?"&#xD;
"Oh, pray do-your opinion is always a&#xD;
improving. Not in public, though" (quit&#xD;
hastily). "I can depreciate myself, but&#xD;
will not allow any one else to depreciate mi&#xD;
-when I can help it. We will walk back t~&#xD;
the house, and you shall give me your dosi&#xD;
of candor on the way."&#xD;
"Suppose we defer it until we are in th&#xD;
house," said Latirner, who saw her drift vera&#xD;
plainly, and had no fancy to abandon Heler&#xD;
for any thing so hackneyed as a flirtation with&#xD;
Miss Cheriton.&#xD;
"That means that you are anxious to de.&#xD;
fer it indefinitely. Will the opinion be so very&#xD;
severe that you are afraid 1 cannot bear it?"&#xD;
"There is but one way to answer that&#xD;
question."&#xD;
"By letting me hear it, of course. May I&#xD;
take your arm? Harry and Miss Trefalden&#xD;
will excuse us, I am sure."&#xD;
Thus unceremoniously left behind, Helen&#xD;
felt amused, and Trefalden not half so indig-&#xD;
nant as might perhaps be imagined. Louise&#xD;
was very charming, of course, and he was ex-&#xD;
tremely fond of ~her; but there was no deny.&#xD;
ing the fact that she was not half as pretty&#xD;
as lichen, nor-really----half so attractive. So&#xD;
he placed, Helen's hand within his arm, took&#xD;
up the thread of conversation exactly where&#xD;
he had dropped it the evening before, and&#xD;
made the path to the house even longer than&#xD;
Miss Cheriton succeeded in doing.&#xD;
Of this fact they had conclusive evidence&#xD;
as they neared the drawing-room, from which&#xD;
that young lady's voice floated out on the&#xD;
still night-air. She was singing to a, harp.&#xD;
accompaniment, and, stopping at the window,&#xD;
Helen said, in genuine admiration, "How beitu-&#xD;
tiful she looks!"&#xD;
She certainly looked, if not beautiful, at&#xD;
least next thing to it; for where does a pretty&#xD;
woman appear to half so much advantage as&#xD;
at the most graceful~instrument which the&#xD;
science of harmony has ever given us? With&#xD;
her white arms thrown across the golden&#xD;
strings, and her face lifted toward Latimer,&#xD;
so as to show off its brilliant complexion, its&#xD;
&#xD;
d large, blue eyes, and bright, brown hair, if&#xD;
Miss Cheriton was not exactly a sight to&#xD;
~. make, an old man young, she was at least a&#xD;
r. sight to turn a young man's head; and of&#xD;
a this fact she was completely and triumphantly&#xD;
I conscious.&#xD;
"Yes, she is extremely pretty," said Tre.&#xD;
fidden; but he said it rather coldly. "I don't&#xD;
~ like flirts, though; and Louise is a dreadful&#xD;
a flirt."&#xD;
"I fancy it is a case of Greek meeting&#xD;
a Greek, with herself and Mr. Latimer," said&#xD;
Helen, laughing.&#xD;
"Latimer! Oh! Latimer is a professional&#xD;
lady-killer. You must take care how.you re-&#xD;
ceive his attentions, my dear Helen" (this in&#xD;
a tender tone of brotherly care). "I should&#xD;
not like him to be able to say that he had&#xD;
ever flirted with you."&#xD;
"I don't think there is the least proba-&#xD;
bility of his being able to say so," answered&#xD;
Helen, coolly. "There! Miss Cheriton is&#xD;
calling you. Had you not better go?"&#xD;
Miss Cheriton had, indeed, perceived her&#xD;
vassal, and did not hesitate to recall him to a&#xD;
due sense of his allegiance.&#xD;
"Yonder's poor Harry, sulking," she said,&#xD;
in a confidential tone, to Latimer. And, not-&#xD;
withstanding that there was no trace of sulk-&#xD;
ing in poor Harry's appearance, she thought&#xD;
it necessary to add: "I must call him, and&#xD;
mollify him; but, pray, don't you go."&#xD;
So Trefalden was called and mollified.&#xD;
Where had he been all this time? They had&#xD;
reached the house ever so long before I Miss&#xD;
Trefalden was very charming, and flirting was&#xD;
very nice, of course; but it wasn't very prop-&#xD;
er-was it, Mr. Latimer?&#xD;
Mr. Latimer replied that, in his humble&#xD;
opiulon, it was a highly moral amusement,&#xD;
but he would not presume to contradict such&#xD;
high authority on the subject as Miss Cheriton&#xD;
was well known to be.&#xD;
* Mr. Trefalden protested against such a&#xD;
word being applied to his cousin and himself.&#xD;
They were like brother and sister had&#xD;
known each other from their earliest child-&#xD;
hood.&#xD;
"Oh, I quite understand that kind of&#xD;
thing!" said Miss Cheriton, gayly. "I had&#xD;
a cousin once-a dear, adorable fellow-and,&#xD;
when anybody said any thing of a disagree-&#xD;
able natureI always answered: 'What! Al-&#xD;
fred? How absurd! Why, I've known Al.&#xD;
fred all my life.'"&#xD;

MISS CHERITON'S RIVAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And that argument had a silencing ef-&#xD;
fect, I presume?"&#xD;
"Invariably. So, you see, I can appre-&#xD;
ciate the full force of it."&#xD;
Helen, meanwhile, entered, and looked&#xD;
round for Rafe. She thought he had made&#xD;
his escape, until she heard him call her name&#xD;
from the back drawing-room, where the light&#xD;
was dim. Following the sound, she found&#xD;
him lying on a couch near the arch which&#xD;
divided the apartments.&#xD;
"What are you doing here, dear?" she&#xD;
asked. "Don't you find it dull?"&#xD;
"How could it possibly be dull with such&#xD;
admirable opportunity for observing human&#xD;
nature?" asked he. "Sit down, Helen. That&#xD;
scene at the harp is worth studying, I assure&#xD;
you. I am anxious to see how long Miss&#xD;
Cheriton will succeed in keeping both objects&#xD;
of her game under her hand and in full&#xD;
view.&#xD;
"As long as she pleases, I suppose," said&#xD;
Helen. "No doubt, they are both anxious to&#xD;
stay."&#xD;
"Hum!" said Rafe, "I have my own&#xD;
opinion on that score. However, we shall&#xD;
see."&#xD;
In less than five minutes they saw Lati-&#xD;
mer leave the harp, and saunter up to his&#xD;
hostess. Ten minutes were given to the de-&#xD;
mands of courtesy. Then, by deliberate&#xD;
degrees, he neared the arch where Helen&#xD;
and Rafe were sitting.&#xD;
" How delightfully sheltered you are!"&#xD;
he said. "May I share your retreat?"&#xD;
"We are Arabian in our hospitality," re-&#xD;
sponded Rafe, smiling. Then, aside, to Helen:&#xD;
"The question is, how long will he be allowed&#xD;
to stay?"&#xD;
That question was settled almost as soon&#xD;
as the other. One swift glance of Miss Cheri-&#xD;
ton's eyes took in the state bf affairs. Be-&#xD;
fore very long, bei voice sounded a recall.&#xD;
"Mr. Latimer, where have you vanished&#xD;
to ?-~~ty dear, do you know where Mr.&#xD;
Latir4~s ?-Oh" (with the most innocent&#xD;
face imaginable), "there you are! I b~g a&#xD;
thousand pardons; I had no idea y~i were so&#xD;
pleasantly engaged. I was only going to say&#xD;
I would sing your song for you now; but, of&#xD;
course, it does not matter."&#xD;
Of course, Latimer was in duty bound to&#xD;
rise and go to the harp, to bend over it and&#xD;
to listen, vrhile ~is song was sung with glances&#xD;
that might have melted a heart of stone. Of&#xD;
&#xD;
course, Trefalden did not find this very sooth-&#xD;
ing to his feelings; so, with something of gen-&#xD;
ulne indignation this time, he, in turn, sought&#xD;
Helen. Of course, in due season, Miss Cheri-&#xD;
ton was graciously pleased to recall him; and&#xD;
so the game went on, shifting its combina-&#xD;
tions, to Rafe's infinite entertainment. When&#xD;
Helen bade him good-night, she could not&#xD;
help asking what he thought of his future&#xD;
sister-in-law; and his answer amused her a&#xD;
little, for he merely shrugged his shoulders,&#xD;
and quoted two lines from a ballad over which&#xD;
they had often laughed:&#xD;
"'He said I kept him off and on in hopes of&#xD;
higher game,&#xD;
And It may be that I did, mother; but who&#xD;
hasn't done the same?'"&#xD;
III-&#xD;
DURING the next day Helen began to feel&#xD;
a little puzzled, and somewhat dismayed, with&#xD;
regard to Miss Cheriton. What she had ex~&#xD;
pected in Harry's ftanc~e, she would have&#xD;
found it difficult to define; but, at least, it&#xD;
was certain thut this young lady, s~ full of&#xD;
vivacity in masculine and so listless, in fe~i-&#xD;
nine society-this young lady who, engagefi,&#xD;
to one man, was jealously anxious, to secure&#xD;
the attentions of another-did not in any re-&#xD;
spect correspond with her sb~dowy idea. In&#xD;
fact, she was a new revelatr6n to the girl&#xD;
whose life had been formed on such a very&#xD;
different model. A certain monotonous round&#xD;
of duties had made the occupation of Helen's&#xD;
existence; and her walks, her flowers, her&#xD;
studies, and Rafe, its amusements. Was it&#xD;
singular, therefore, that she listened with sur-&#xD;
prise to the record of a life made up of vis-&#xD;
its, balls, regattas, admirers, dresses-all the&#xD;
light froth of that lightest' kind of society&#xD;
which calls itself "the fashionable world?"&#xD;
On her side, Miss Cheriton was, if any thing,&#xD;
more astonished. That any one could really&#xD;
support an existence like that of Helen was&#xD;
beyond her powers of imagination. The&#xD;
two women looked at each other across a&#xD;
gulf which they had no means of spanning.&#xD;
There was no middle ground, no neutral ter-&#xD;
ritory of taste or knowledge, on which they&#xD;
could meet; and such a neutral ground is&#xD;
essential, not only to friendship, but to any&#xD;
thing like cordial acquaintance. ~They were&#xD;
both young; they were both pretty; and they&#xD;
were as different as the opposite poles! Tl~e&#xD;
only thing they owned in common was a cer-&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS CHERITON'S RIVAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
7~3&#xD;
&#xD;
taiu feeling of antagonism, of which Helez&#xD;
was conscious in a slight and Miss Cheritox&#xD;
in a very marked degree.&#xD;
Other days wore not much better thai&#xD;
this day; that is, there was not much mor&#xD;
of a friendly understanding between the twc&#xD;
women whom malicious Fate had chosen tc&#xD;
array against each other as rivals. It was a&#xD;
queer game of cross-purposes which went on&#xD;
at the Manor during this time. Rafe, who&#xD;
was a quiet looker-on, perhaps understood&#xD;
more of its drift and purpose than any one&#xD;
else - either then or afterward. He had&#xD;
something of na interest in watching it, too,&#xD;
besides his interest in Helen; for he soon&#xD;
grew to like Latimer with a very cordial lik-&#xD;
ing, and observation less keen than his might&#xD;
readily have perceived that to this eager, am-&#xD;
bitious man, this man crowned with the&#xD;
world's honors, and panting for the world's&#xD;
applause, the world itself began to narrow&#xD;
down into that spot which was brightened by&#xD;
the light of Helen Trefalden's eyes. It is&#xD;
said that such an hour cones once at least in&#xD;
every man's life. Whether this be true or&#xD;
not, the hour certainly came to Latimer now.&#xD;
Indeed, it is doubtful if he~had ever before&#xD;
kn~%rn any thing more than transient fancies;&#xD;
so, when the flood-gates wore lifted at last,&#xD;
and~i passion stronger and deeper for the&#xD;
long delay rushed in upon him, his profound&#xD;
worldly training stood him iii little stead,&#xD;
and he knew scarcely more than the merest&#xD;
boy w~at were the chances for and against&#xD;
him with the woman whom, alone of all the&#xD;
wom~p'he had ever seen, he desired and re-&#xD;
solved to call his own.&#xD;
Alas I the verdict against him was a short&#xD;
one-he came too late I There are some na-&#xD;
ture~ -fortuiiately very rare ones which,&#xD;
hajgoiice given affection, are wholly unable&#xD;
to recall it, however cruelly it may be wasted,&#xD;
however thoroughly trust may fail. Helen's&#xD;
was one of these. Hers was a heart so gen-&#xD;
tle, so loving, so faithful even unto death,&#xD;
that ,it merited a better fate than the one&#xD;
which had befallen it. This heart, which&#xD;
some men would have died to win, or would&#xD;
haveworn like a diamond on the breast which&#xD;
had won it, this heart had been given to one&#xD;
man who held it lightly in his hand till he&#xD;
wearied of it, and then flung it down in the&#xD;
dust of the roadside, from which not even he&#xD;
cQuld ever lift it again. Rafe alone appre-&#xD;
ciated this, and groaned to himself as he per-&#xD;
&#xD;
ceived that the power which should have&#xD;
made the glory and happiness of his cousins&#xD;
lifc-her indomitable constancy-..was like a&#xD;
sharp sword turned against herself'. It would&#xD;
have wrecked his existence ,to have parted&#xD;
with her, he thought, but still he could have&#xD;
done it, he could have given her to Latimer,&#xD;
who was worthy of her, Latimer on whom&#xD;
every man's eye was turned in envy, and&#xD;
every woman's in admiration; and the bitter-&#xD;
ness lay in thinking that this which could&#xD;
never be, might have been, but for a frivo-&#xD;
lous, empty puppy (so Rafe did not hesitate to&#xD;
designate his brother), with neither heart nor&#xD;
soul worthy of the name.&#xD;
It was small consolation to perceive how&#xD;
constant and unremitting were Miss Cheri-&#xD;
ton's exertions to attach Latimer to her char-&#xD;
iot-wheels, and how completely they failed I&#xD;
This was not only because a stronger and a,&#xD;
deeper power was at work with him. Under&#xD;
any circumstances, her blandishments were&#xD;
too transparent, her arts were too common-&#xD;
place, her object was too plain, for any hope&#xD;
of success. Latimer merely laughed and&#xD;
shrugged his shoulders, amused him~lf a lit-&#xD;
tle-not enough to give occasion for any seri-&#xD;
ous triumph-and let the battery of fascina-&#xD;
tion play harmlessly on his coat-of-mail. She&#xD;
wa~ a pretty woman, he told Rafe, but pretty&#xD;
women were common, and, for his part, he&#xD;
had been surfeited with them in the way of&#xD;
flirtation. "Miss Cheriton has not even the&#xD;
merit of being a first-class coquette," he add-&#xD;
ed. "She goes over the beaten path, and&#xD;
knows only the most hackneyed arts of her&#xD;
profession." Miss Cheriton, however, did&#xD;
not despair. She had that regal trust in her-&#xD;
self, and in her own power of achieving any&#xD;
thing, which is said to be one of the charac-&#xD;
teristics of genius. She had long looked upon&#xD;
Latimer with covetous eyes, and a better op-&#xD;
portunity than the present her heart could not&#xD;
have desired. A country-house, with unlimit-&#xD;
ed opportunities for fascination, the field all&#xD;
to herself, and her only rival a girl~ had&#xD;
never been in society-what more pos~&#xD;
sible to ask? True, success did not crown&#xD;
her efforts quite as rapidly as she expected.&#xD;
But she had time and strategy at command,&#xD;
so she did what many an abler general has&#xD;
found himself obliged to do-she waited.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Trefalden-animated by Lati-&#xD;
mer's example - was veering nearer and&#xD;
nearer to his cousin, his fickle fancy wander-&#xD;

&#xD;
ing daily farther and farther from the place&#xD;
where it was, or should have been, bound by&#xD;
his honor. Some men do not appreciate any&#xD;
thing-be it wife, or horse, or house, or Jew-&#xD;
els-until it bears the stamp of other admira-&#xD;
tion besides their own; and Trefalden was es-&#xD;
peciall~' of this class. Helen's beauty had&#xD;
very nearly taken his heart (or whatever did&#xD;
duty for that organ) by storm, when he saw&#xD;
her on the terrace under the roses. But&#xD;
even then she had only been to him his&#xD;
cousin, the "little Helen" whom he had pet-&#xD;
ted and patronized in boyhood. Now all this&#xD;
was c~ianged. Now he saw a woman at whom&#xD;
he looked wish Latimer's eyes, admired with&#xD;
Latimer's admiration, wellnigh loved with&#xD;
Latimer's love-only Latimer's was the real&#xD;
article, and his the spurious imitation. He&#xD;
entertained a shrewd suspicion that Louise&#xD;
was playing fast and loose with him, and he&#xD;
would not have had the least scruple in play-&#xD;
ing fast and loose with her in return. If&#xD;
Helen bore the least liking to him, she had&#xD;
only to give a sign. He, for his part,'was the&#xD;
more ready to 'meet her half-way.&#xD;
"What a glorious night P' said Latimer,&#xD;
one' evening, as he stepped through the din-&#xD;
ing-room window out on the terrace, where&#xD;
the silver radiance of the full moon made al-&#xD;
most the brightness, without any of the heat,&#xD;
of day. "Isn't it possible to do something&#xD;
more than merely enjoy it here? Can't we&#xD;
go to the river and take a row?'~&#xD;
"Charming!" cried Miss Cheriton, who&#xD;
was close behind him. "Of course we can-&#xD;
can't we, Harry? I should like nothing bet-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
"I see no objection," said Harry. "The&#xD;
boat is in order, I suppose - is it not,&#xD;
Helen?"&#xD;
"Yes, the boat is in very good order," an-&#xD;
swered Helen; "at least it was on Saturday&#xD;
morning when Mr. Latimer and myself-"&#xD;
she pause~l a moment, as Miss Cheriton's eyes&#xD;
turned quickly upon her, then quietly went&#xD;
on en Mr. Latimer and myself took a&#xD;
shor~f~.v."&#xD;
"So rowing is one of the features of your&#xD;
walks with Mr. Latimer?" said Miss Cheri-&#xD;
ton, a little sharply. "It is fortunate that&#xD;
you were careful not to say any thing about&#xD;
it, or you might have had an addition to your&#xD;
party, and that would not have been pleasant&#xD;
-would it?"&#xD;
"We are plainly expected to say No, Miss&#xD;
&#xD;
Trefalden. Suppose we say it? I always&#xD;
like to do what is expected of mc."&#xD;
"Especially when it is entirely compatible&#xD;
with the strictest truth," retorted the young&#xD;
lady. "Of course, Miss Trefalden would say&#xD;
No if she was as candid as yourself. Fray,&#xD;
don't be afraid, however. We will be consid-&#xD;
erate enough to do our rowing by moonlight,&#xD;
so as not to interfere with yours by day.&#xD;
light."&#xD;
"There are two boats on the river," said&#xD;
Latimer, with the utmost gravity. "If Harry&#xD;
and yourself choose to follow our example to.&#xD;
morrow, we will give you the full benefit and&#xD;
free use of the stream."&#xD;
"Thanks, for myself," said Harry, indo-&#xD;
lently; "but I believe I prefer to take the&#xD;
full benefit and free use of it to.night.-Helen,&#xD;
shall we leave them to finish their discussion&#xD;
at their leisure?"&#xD;
Helen assented; but, for once, Miss Cher-&#xD;
iton seemed disposed to assert a claim to her&#xD;
vassal. "There is no discussion to be fin.&#xD;
ished," said she, hastily. "Don't be so incon-&#xD;
siderate as to carry off Miss Trefalden, Harry.&#xD;
I am coming with you; but, if I go without&#xD;
my scarf, my dear, foolish aunt will preach&#xD;
about it for the next month. Wait for me a&#xD;
moment."&#xD;
She went into the house; but Harry proved&#xD;
singularly disobedient to orders. "You can&#xD;
wait for her, Latimer," he said. "Helen and&#xD;
I will walk on slowly, and, no doubt, you will&#xD;
overtake us before we reach the river."&#xD;
Helen and himself walked on slowly-who&#xD;
does not walk slowly' on a moonlight summer&#xD;
night ?-but the re'ilt which was to follow&#xD;
did not come to pass. Mr. Latimer and Miss&#xD;
Cheriton did not overtake them before they&#xD;
reached the river; nor, in fact, after they had&#xD;
done so. Helen negative Harry's proposal&#xD;
of going on the water immediately, and in-&#xD;
sisted on waiting for the others; but waiting&#xD;
was in vain. They did not come. And, after&#xD;
nearly an hour had passed, the inference was&#xD;
plain that they did not mean to come.&#xD;
"We had better go back," said Helen,&#xD;
gravely, for she stood in considerable aive of&#xD;
Miss Cheriton's mocking tongue. "Some-&#xD;
thing must have occurred to detain them,&#xD;
Harry."&#xD;
"Some fit of Louise's caprice has occurred&#xD;
to detain them," said Harry. "Nothing else,&#xD;
I am sure. She grows more wilful 'and ca-&#xD;
pricious every day," he added, in a tone of&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS CHERI&#xD;
&#xD;
very unloverlike irritation. "We need not&#xD;
let her spoil our pleasure, Helen. Since we&#xD;
have walked down here, we must certainly&#xD;
have a row."&#xD;
"I really think we had better go back,"&#xD;
said Helen. She did not like to say "we&#xD;
must," for was not this Harry, and did it not&#xD;
ecem absurd to think that it could possibly&#xD;
be "not proper" to go anywhere with him?&#xD;
Yet an instinct warned her against the pleas-&#xD;
nrc which was as much a temptation to her-&#xD;
self as to him, and she rose and turned away&#xD;
from the river as she repeated, for the fourth&#xD;
time, "We had better go back."&#xD;
"Nonsense!" said Harry. "Here is the&#xD;
boat-come! I assure you I am not going&#xD;
back."&#xD;
"But, Harry~~~&#xD;
"Come!" said Harry.&#xD;
He sprang into the boat as he spoke, and&#xD;
pushed it near the shore, then turned and held&#xD;
out his hand to assist her into it. The great,&#xD;
broad river, with the moonlight silvering its&#xD;
current, flowed majestically by; the drooping&#xD;
shade, that fringed its banks, looked dark and&#xD;
mysterious; the little boat rocked on the&#xD;
water as Trefalden leaned forward, and Helen&#xD;
stood on the bank-hesitating, longing-un.&#xD;
able to stay, yet certain that it was unwise to&#xD;
go. For a moment the soft rush of the river&#xD;
was the only sound that broke the stillness.&#xD;
Then-&#xD;
"Helen," said Trefalden, in a tone strange-&#xD;
ly earnest, "won't you come? Why should&#xD;
you hesitate? Remember how oftea we have&#xD;
been here before."&#xD;
"I remember," said Helen, in a low voice.&#xD;
"Then why should you hesitate now?&#xD;
Helen "-pleadingly-" give me one happy&#xD;
hour-one hour like the dear old times. It&#xD;
is little to you, it is much to me-come!"&#xD;
Poor Helen! Can any one blame her that I&#xD;
she went? It seemed so little, and yet-it&#xD;
was so much! Why should she not taste the I&#xD;
happy hour of which he spoke, and dream one&#xD;
last dream of the old time before she put its&#xD;
memory from her forever? It seemed so lit-&#xD;
tIe, and Harry was only Harry, after all; her&#xD;
cousin, almost her brother, by right of long&#xD;
companionship. So she laid her hand in the&#xD;
one outstretched for it,~atepped into the boat, I&#xD;
and a moment later the oars had been plunged&#xD;
into the water, and they were gliding down ~&#xD;
the stream.&#xD;
It was a night of which to dream-softf a&#xD;
&#xD;
K'&#xD;
&#xD;
TON'S RIVAL.                         '15&#xD;
magical, almost unearthly in its beauty. For&#xD;
a long time they were both silent; then Tre.&#xD;
fallen looked at his companion, who sat op.&#xD;
polite him, and spoke quite abruptly.&#xD;
"Do you know what I wish, Helen ?-.&#xD;
what I would at this moment give any thing&#xD;
in the world to accomplish?"&#xD;
"How should I know?" asked Helen. She&#xD;
did not look at him, but kept her eyes fixed&#xD;
dreamily on the shore past which they were&#xD;
gliding.&#xD;
"I wish," said Trefalden, with passionate&#xD;
emphasis, "that you and I were cut off from&#xD;
every other human being, and drifting toward&#xD;
a home and a life of our own, far from any-&#xD;
body and everybody else of whom we know."&#xD;
Helen started. There was that in the&#xD;
speaker's tone which was more than his&#xD;
words, and which warned her instantly that&#xD;
she had been unwise to come. Something&#xD;
made a great leap into her throat and, fright-&#xD;
ened her. It was the very consciousness' of&#xD;
her own weakness which gave her strength to&#xD;
answer.&#xD;
"How absurd, Harry?" she said-trying,&#xD;
ah! so hard to speak lightly-" we are as&#xD;
much cut oil' at present as you could possi-&#xD;
bly desire. There is not the kast need to&#xD;
wish for a desert island in which we could&#xD;
sigh for company and civilization to our&#xD;
hearts' content."&#xD;
"Don't jest," said Trefalden, in a tone of&#xD;
absolute pain. "Don't-~.-don't try to ward&#xD;
off serious truth like this, Helen! You know&#xD;
what I mean," he said, with sudden passion;&#xD;
"you don't need for me to tell you how much&#xD;
I love you! you must believe it, for you 'must&#xD;
see how it has mastered every thought and&#xD;
faculty of my whole being, until silence is&#xD;
beyond my power!"&#xD;
"Harry," said Helen, gravely-and some.&#xD;
Ihing in her tone reminded him of the manner&#xD;
[n which she had often curbed his wayward&#xD;
~umors as a boy-" Harry, it is not possible&#xD;
~ou mean to make me regret having trusted&#xD;
myself with you? What is the sens such&#xD;
vild words as these? I am loath t~iink&#xD;
hat you would willingly wrong or pain me,&#xD;
ret you are doing both now."&#xD;
"Can I wrong or pain you by telling you&#xD;
iow I love you?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Helen, and a flash of very&#xD;
unusual resentment came into her eyes.&#xD;
'You do both, when you use such words to&#xD;
ac! Do you think I am a toy to serve your&#xD;

amusement?" she asked, with a vibration&#xD;
of passion deeper even than his own, stirring&#xD;
through her voice. "You are engagedd to&#xD;
Miss Cheriton, and yet you venture to tell&#xD;
me that you love me. What am I to think&#xD;
of you after that?"&#xD;
"To think that Miss Cheriton is nothing&#xD;
to me, and that you are every thing," said he,&#xD;
recklessly. "I fling hey, and every thought&#xD;
of her, to the winds. I am yours, Helen, and&#xD;
it is for you to say what you will do with&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"And your honor?" asked Helen, bitterly,&#xD;
"where is that?"&#xD;
Even in the moonlight sho could see that&#xD;
a dark flush came over his face.&#xD;
"My honor is safe in my own keeping,"&#xD;
he said, haughtily. "I break no faith iz~&#xD;
breaking with a woman like Louise Cheriton.&#xD;
She means to marry me only in case she can.&#xD;
not secure higher game. You see what she&#xD;
is, Helen. You cannot blame me that I put&#xD;
her out of my life without even a consider.&#xD;
ation."&#xD;
"But I do blame you," said Helen, coldly.&#xD;
"What is more, I do not believe that a Tre-&#xD;
falden can forget that a gentleman owes it to&#xD;
himself to keep his faith unbroken. You are&#xD;
talking wildly, Harry-you arc not yourself.&#xD;
Let us try and forget this."&#xD;
"You are talking the foolish common-&#xD;
places of a woman," said Harry, impatiently.&#xD;
"Forget it! A man does not forget what is&#xD;
written on his heart in letters of fire! Helen,&#xD;
you must forgive me if I speak plainly-&#xD;
this is no time for paltering; and, one way&#xD;
or another, my fate must be fixed to-night.&#xD;
Memories which I had forgotten, or carelessly&#xD;
laid aside, have come t~ me of late, and I-&#xD;
I think that perhaps two years ago, you loved&#xD;
me. If so, all this has come on me as a pun.&#xD;
ishment for my own blind folly. Helen, was&#xD;
it so?"&#xD;
There was a deep silence. How could&#xD;
Helen put herself in this man's power by&#xD;
ack~~edging what she. had hidden so care-&#xD;
fully~m every one save Rafe, and yet-&#xD;
how could she deny the truth when brought&#xD;
face to face with it? Such denial would have&#xD;
been easy to some women, but it was not&#xD;
easy to her. Truth was, and had always been,&#xD;
to her a grand, severe power, with which it&#xD;
was impossible to trifle. Her face was so pale&#xD;
that it looked like sculptured marble in the&#xD;
moonlight as she answered:&#xD;
&#xD;
"You have no right to ask me that ques-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"I have a right," said Trefalden, vehe-&#xD;
mently, "or else, by Heaven! I will make&#xD;
one! Helen "- he dropped the oar, and&#xD;
seized her fragile, passive hands - "you&#xD;
would not evade the point if you could deny&#xD;
it. You did love me, and, by that love, I&#xD;
claim you. My first duty is to you-was to&#xD;
you, when I forsook you for that vain, frivo-&#xD;
lous-"&#xD;
"Hush!" said Helen; and, by a supreme&#xD;
effort, she wrenched her hands out of his&#xD;
clasp, and looked at him in the silvery moon-&#xD;
light with a face that was set and stew. "You&#xD;
lower yourself even more than you lower me&#xD;
by such words as these! I will not listen to&#xD;
them. Turn the boat around, and take me&#xD;
back to the shore. I demand it."&#xD;
"It shall drift on forever before I turn&#xD;
back, unless I hear the truth," answered he.&#xD;
"Helen, you do right to resent the love of a&#xD;
man who is as fickle as I have been. But&#xD;
try to remember-try to be reasonable-think&#xD;
that I was little more than a boy when I&#xD;
left here, that I went into the world with a&#xD;
head and a heart equally ready to be turned&#xD;
by its follies, and that I was sufficiently un-&#xD;
worthy of you to suffer the remembrance of&#xD;
you to pass from me; but, in thinking of this,&#xD;
that I come back from the world only to real.&#xD;
ize what you are, only to see and feel how&#xD;
mad I have been in leaving gold for dross,&#xD;
and to place my heart again where it was&#xD;
long ago-where, in truth, I think it has al-&#xD;
ways been-in your keeping. Helen, surely&#xD;
It is not too late?"&#xD;
The passion of this appeal seemed to&#xD;
shake her, for she shivered all over, then&#xD;
clasped her hands firmly together, and an-&#xD;
swered him gravely and sadly:&#xD;
"Yes, it is too late."&#xD;
"Too late!" The handsome face paled-..&#xD;
flushed-and paled again. "You mean that&#xD;
you have ceased to love me, or that you have&#xD;
learned to love Latimer?"&#xD;
"I mean," she said-and her voice seemed&#xD;
to thrill him with its deep, mournful pathos-&#xD;
"that it is too late for you, and too late for&#xD;
me, Harry. Too late for you, because you are&#xD;
engaged to Miss Cheriton; too late for me,&#xD;
because, if you were free as air, I would not&#xD;
marry you."&#xD;
He looked at her steadily. It was a strange&#xD;
duel of conflicting resolution to take place out&#xD;
&#xD;
there on the broad, moonlit river, betwe&#xD;
these two who had once loved each other wil&#xD;
the tender romance of early youth.&#xD;
"Why not?" he asked, huskily.&#xD;
"There is no need of forcing me to te&#xD;
you," she answered. "All this is very useless&#xD;
Let us go back.".&#xD;
"Why not?" he repeated once more, an&#xD;
the deep, passionate resolve of his eyes tol&#xD;
Helen that the question must be answered&#xD;
that no evasion would be possible or eve&#xD;
safe. Then, as it were, she girded up he&#xD;
strength and answered him - answered his&#xD;
in words which, to his dying day, he neve&#xD;
forgot.&#xD;
"I will tell you why not," she said. "I&#xD;
is because I once loved you, and, through&#xD;
that love, learned to know you. It is not fo:&#xD;
me to speak of what I hoped - leaning or&#xD;
your own promise - when you went away~&#xD;
It is not worth while, either, to speak of whal&#xD;
I suffered when I realized that you had quitE&#xD;
forgotten me. That pain, bitter as it was, is&#xD;
over now. But you took from me something&#xD;
which neither you nor any one else can ever&#xD;
give back." She paused a moment, and looked&#xD;
wistfully away from him-far over the hills&#xD;
softened by the misty moonlight, and the dark&#xD;
shadows of the drooping woods-then, very&#xD;
quietly, she went on: "I do not know whether&#xD;
or not it was that I poured out the whole&#xD;
treasure of love wastefully, and so have none&#xD;
left, but my heart lies like a stone. Your&#xD;
words, your tones to-night have made it ache,&#xD;
but that is all. I did not realize, until I heard&#xD;
you sp~ak as you have done, how far removed&#xD;
you are from me. Once I was yours, to have&#xD;
done with me what you would: now I could&#xD;
not be more dead to you if I were in my grave.&#xD;
That is my answer. So long as we both live,&#xD;
there is none other possible between us2'&#xD;
The clear, chill tones - chill, and yet&#xD;
strangely gentle-ceased. Their last musical&#xD;
vibration died away, and only the rush of the&#xD;
river sounded in Trefalden's ears. He said&#xD;
not a word, his lips were parched, and ha&#xD;
could not speak. Something like a bitter&#xD;
sense of the inevitable seemed weighing him&#xD;
down. Speak? What could he say? Man&#xD;
as he was, and full even t~ arrogance of con-&#xD;
scious power, he felt in~ every fibre that the&#xD;
resolution of this fragile girl was like iron,&#xD;
that he might dash himself and all his&#xD;
strength vainly against it. So he uttered&#xD;
not a syllable. He only turned the boat I&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
m around, and began steadily rowing against&#xD;
~h the current back to the place of landing.&#xD;
As they reached the bank, and as Helen&#xD;
was preparing to rise and step on shore, he&#xD;
II spoke for the first time, his voice sounding&#xD;
s. unlike itself and wonderfully distinct on the&#xD;
still night air:&#xD;
d "Helen, you need not think that I shall&#xD;
d accept your decision as final. A man cannot&#xD;
I, surrender without a struggle the only hope&#xD;
n which makes his life. 'I love you, I have al-&#xD;
r ways loved you, and I shall always love you.&#xD;
a Remember this, and remember also that I&#xD;
r am simply waiting to see what you will do&#xD;
with this love."&#xD;
Before Helen could reply, even by a single&#xD;
word, there was a sound on the shore that&#xD;
made them both start-a suppressed excla-&#xD;
mation, a crackling twig evidently crushed&#xD;
by a hasty foot, and from behind a group&#xD;
of trees Miss Cheriton stepped full into the&#xD;
moonlight, facing them both.&#xD;
Iv.&#xD;
WHEN Miss Cheriton, after considerable&#xD;
delay, came out with a light scarf becomingly&#xD;
twined around her, and found only Latimer&#xD;
waiting for her, it is doubtful, to say the least,&#xD;
if her disappointment was very extreme.-&#xD;
"What, has Harry gone?" she said, in a&#xD;
tone of slightly-piqued astonishment. But&#xD;
Latimer's "I let him go because I thought&#xD;
you might give rae this opportunity to make&#xD;
my peace," was sufficient to banish any cloud&#xD;
from her brow.&#xD;
"Your peace!" repeated she, slipping her&#xD;
white hand through the arm which he of..&#xD;
fered, and leaning heavily upon it, as they&#xD;
walked down the terrace steps. "You know&#xD;
as well as I do that there is no peace to be&#xD;
made. Of course I have no right to be of-&#xD;
fended, however plainly you may show me or&#xD;
tell me that you prefer Miss Trefalden's so-&#xD;
ciety to mine."&#xD;
"It would be unfortunate for me if I&#xD;
chanced to prefer yours," said Latimer, his&#xD;
cool fashion; "considering that Tre~den&#xD;
han a legal claim to its monopoly."&#xD;
"Not quite a legal claim yet," said she,&#xD;
with superb carelessness. "And it would be&#xD;
a wise man, indeed, who could prophesy with&#xD;
certainty that he ever will have. That is all&#xD;
nonsense, Mr. Lathner; and you know me&#xD;
well enough to be sure of it."&#xD;

&#xD;
mer. "Your engagement to Trefalden? Poor&#xD;
fellow! For his sake, I hope not."&#xD;
"I was not speaking of my engagement,"&#xD;
said she. "But I was never one of the people&#xD;
who have severe ideas about such things.&#xD;
Many engagements are only made to be bro.&#xD;
ken; and I am inclined to think it would be a&#xD;
good thing if more of them were. If I should&#xD;
think it worth while to dismiss Harry to-mor-&#xD;
row, I don't flatter myself that he would suf-&#xD;
fer in any way-.--save, perhaps, from a little&#xD;
wounded vanity. His devotion to his cousin&#xD;
is really quite edifying." (Then, after a&#xD;
pause,) "I wonder ~~ota are not jealous."&#xD;
"Of you? He might consider that pre-&#xD;
sumptuous."&#xD;
"I was not ~'peaking of myself. Miss&#xD;
Trefalden, I am sure, will not think it pre-&#xD;
sumptuous if you were jealous of her."&#xD;
"Harry is a capital fellow," said Latimer,&#xD;
who was plainly resolved against bringing&#xD;
Miss Trefalden's name into the conversation.&#xD;
"I really don't know a better one, Miss&#xD;
Cheriton. I would think twice, if I were you,&#xD;
before I made his attentions to his cousin a&#xD;
reason for that dismissal of which you speak."&#xD;
"You don't suppose I'm thinking of his&#xD;
attentions to his cousin," said Miss Cheriton,&#xD;
with a rising color, which shone even in the&#xD;
moonlight. "Of course, they signifynothing,&#xD;
except that he is fond of amusing himself&#xD;
with anybody who is good material for amuse-&#xD;
ment; and that" (with a scornful accent)&#xD;
"Miss Trefalden certainly seems to be. I&#xD;
was thinking ~f myself alone when I said, or&#xD;
meant to say, that I should not allow myself&#xD;
to be fettered by any engagement an hour&#xD;
longer than I chor a to do so."&#xD;
Said Mr. Latimer, in a tone the satire of&#xD;
which the young lady was happily unable to&#xD;
appreciate, "Your sentiments, I perceive, are&#xD;
broadly liberal with regard to how far a wom-&#xD;
an's word may be taken as her bond."&#xD;
"~[ think that a woman as impulsive as I&#xD;
am is liable to make mistakes," said she,&#xD;
somewhat sentimentally; "and that it would&#xD;
be ~d if my whole life had to bear the pen..&#xD;
alty of them from a mistaken sense of honor&#xD;
about breaking my word. Is it possible that&#xD;
you would condemn me to it?"&#xD;
"I!" shrugging his shoulders slightly.&#xD;
"I am the most amiable man in the world. I&#xD;
never condemn anybody to any thing-even&#xD;
in theory. Sometimes, however, I recom-&#xD;
mend them to remember that 'the quality of&#xD;
&#xD;
mercy is not strained,' and that it is never&#xD;
more gracefully exercised than by a beautiful&#xD;
woman."&#xD;
"Keep your well-turned periods for your&#xD;
speeches!" said she, tapping him on the&#xD;
arm. "Listen to me gravely and seriously&#xD;
now, for I have something that I want to ask&#xD;
you. Here is a pleasant place-suppose that&#xD;
we sit down and talk at our leisure?"&#xD;
"But the boating," said Latimer, a little&#xD;
aghast. "Harry and Miss Trefalden will be&#xD;
waiting for us."&#xD;
"Let them wait," with admirable non-&#xD;
chalance; "they are very well able to enter-&#xD;
tain each other, you may be sure. I have a&#xD;
fancy to sit down just here under this splen-&#xD;
did tree."&#xD;
"IBy all means gratify it, then," said Lati-&#xD;
mer, with an audible sigh of resignation. "I&#xD;
only hope we may not surprise a family party&#xD;
of rattlesnakes," he added, following her ex-&#xD;
ample, and seating himself on the branching&#xD;
roots of a giant oak that stood by the way-&#xD;
side.&#xD;
But Miss Cheriton was quite insensible to&#xD;
any fear of rattlesnakes. Perhaps she knew&#xD;
that, as a general rule, they prefer less civil-&#xD;
ized haunts. At all events, she sank down&#xD;
in a picturesque attitude, and leaned against&#xD;
the massive trunk, looking certainly very&#xD;
lovely as the moonlight shimmered down&#xD;
through the thick foliage on her white dress&#xD;
and upturned face.&#xD;
"Suppose," said she, after a while, "I&#xD;
were to tell you that I-I had almost made&#xD;
up my mind to break my engagement with&#xD;
Harry. What would you think?"&#xD;
Latimer shrugged his shoulders. "I should&#xD;
probably think that you had grown tired of&#xD;
it," said he, dryly.&#xD;
"I am in earnest," said she, a little petu-&#xD;
lantly. "Pray talk to me seriously and-as&#xD;
a friend. I "-a droop of the head-" I am&#xD;
sadly uncertain what to do, and I need the&#xD;
advice of a friend very much."&#xD;
"As a friend, Miss Cheriton, I should be&#xD;
very happy to serve you; but advising you is&#xD;
a height to which modesty forbids me to as-&#xD;
-  7,&#xD;
pire.&#xD;
"I am sure no one could advise me better&#xD;
than yourself."&#xD;
"You are mistaken" - it was doubtful&#xD;
whether the scene was beginning to be most&#xD;
amusing or most boring to him-" a man&#xD;
must have certain fixed ideas and principles&#xD;
&#xD;
before he can venture to advise. Now, I hay&#xD;
none."&#xD;
"But you know what you think."&#xD;
"I assure you that, nine times out of ten&#xD;
I don't even know what I think. Sad, isa'&#xD;
it? But you see what a very unsafe mentor:&#xD;
should make."&#xD;
"Still "-clinging to her point with deter&#xD;
mined obstinacy - "you must advise mc&#xD;
You know Harry, and-and-I think you&#xD;
know me. Now, tell me frankly, do you&#xD;
think there is any hope of happiness for in&#xD;
together? Do you think we suit?"&#xD;
"My dear Miss Cheriton," said Latimer,&#xD;
laughing, "you ask me a hard question. Do&#xD;
I think you suit? My impression was that&#xD;
you suited remarkably well. But really, in&#xD;
that, as in every thing else, the only person&#xD;
able to judge is the person immediately con-&#xD;
cerned?"&#xD;
"You-you think I could be happy with&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"He is such a good fellow, that I don't&#xD;
see how any woman could fail to be happy&#xD;
with him."&#xD;
"It shows how little you know of me,"&#xD;
said she, bitterly, and turned her face&#xD;
aside.&#xD;
Poor woman! The pangs of wounded&#xD;
vanity are sometimes as sharp as the pangs&#xD;
of disappointed love, and she was scarcely&#xD;
less to be pitied because her object had been&#xD;
so petty, and her means so unworthy. Wom-&#xD;
an of the world as she was, she knew perfect-&#xD;
ly well how far she had stooped to this man-&#xD;
and, now that she had failed completely, this&#xD;
knowledge was very hard to bear. At that&#xD;
moment such a swift, sudden rage and mor-&#xD;
tification flamed up in her heart, that she&#xD;
could have lifted her hand and struck him as&#xD;
he sat beside her so cool, so quiet, so entire-&#xD;
ly beyond her power of moving. Years after-&#xD;
ward, when their paths of life had branched&#xD;
far apart, she could never even hear his name&#xD;
without seeing again the silvery moonlight,&#xD;
the softly-swelling fields, the gnarled roots of&#xD;
the old oak, and the little scene, as brightly~&#xD;
and vividly as she saw it that night, without&#xD;
feeling again the same bitter tide of emotion&#xD;
which she felt as she turned from him, con-&#xD;
scious that he understood her, and that all&#xD;
further efforts *ere hopeless.&#xD;
Latimer was the first to break the silence&#xD;
which ensued, speaking more gently and con-&#xD;
siderately than was often the case with him.&#xD;
&#xD;
e Perhaps he knew as well as Miss Cheriton&#xD;
herself what was passing in her mind.&#xD;
"Don't you think we had better go on to&#xD;
, the river? It is very charming and comfort-&#xD;
t able here; but, no doubt, Harry and Miss Tre-&#xD;
[ falden are waiting for us."&#xD;
"Certainly, by all means, let us go," said&#xD;
- she, rising and accepting, without a word, the&#xD;
I arm which he offered.&#xD;
When they reached the river, they found,&#xD;
naturally enough, that Harry and Miss Tre.&#xD;
falden were gone. One of the boats had also&#xD;
vanished, and Miss Cheriton declined Lati-&#xD;
mer's proposal that they should embark in&#xD;
the other. "We will sit here and wait&#xD;
a while," said she. "If they don't come soon,&#xD;
we can return to the house." She did not&#xD;
add, but Latimer was perfectly aware, that&#xD;
she would have gone back at once but for her&#xD;
determination to avoid another long tite-d-&amp;amp;ite&#xD;
with himself. She had the desire, riot un-&#xD;
common with her sex when stung by one&#xD;
man's neglect, to turn to another of whose al-&#xD;
legiance she was sure, to find in his homage a&#xD;
salve for a wounded pride, and in his appre-&#xD;
ciation recompense for the other's blindness.&#xD;
It would make a queer little chapter in those&#xD;
affairs commonly called "of the heart," if&#xD;
many a successful suitor could know the se-&#xD;
cret of the rebound in which he has caught&#xD;
his prize. "I will wait for Harry," said she,&#xD;
coldly. And, in truth, at that moment, she&#xD;
felt a positive tenderness for Harry. He, at&#xD;
least, was hers-hers triumphantly and alone&#xD;
She had one faithful vassal, at least, and in&#xD;
that thought was something like balm.&#xD;
So they sat down under a clump of trees&#xD;
and waited until round the bend of the stream&#xD;
the boat came in sigbt. Its appearance was&#xD;
welcome to both watchers; and, as Trefalden&#xD;
-who was putting all his energy into his&#xD;
strokes-sent it rapidly toward the bank, Miss&#xD;
Cheriton gave undisguised expression to her&#xD;
relief.&#xD;
"It looks pleasant," she said, "and how&#xD;
well Harry rows! I think I shall make him&#xD;
take me out on the water. You "-art irre-&#xD;
pressible accent of bitterness-" will be glad&#xD;
of that, Mr. Latimer."&#xD;
"I am always glad of your enjoyment,"&#xD;
responded Mr. Latimer, in hi~ usual tone.&#xD;
"But, of course, you cannot expect me to be&#xD;
glad of my own desolation."&#xD;
"A desolation easily consoled by Miss&#xD;
Trefalden. Hush, here they come! Let u~&#xD;

say nothing, and surprise them when, they&#xD;
have landed."&#xD;
Never was the trite phrttse, that surprises&#xD;
are always ill-judged, better exemplified than&#xD;
on this occasion. The boat shot up to the&#xD;
shore, Helen rose to step out, and Trefalden,&#xD;
extending his hand1 stopped her.&#xD;
Now, when Miss Cheriton came forward&#xD;
and faced the two cousins, with all the bear-&#xD;
ing of a tragedy-queen, it was certainly only&#xD;
natural that they should have quailed a little.&#xD;
Partly from consternation, but, more from&#xD;
sheer surpr.is~, Trefalden uttered an exclama-&#xD;
tion, while Helen drew back a step, saying:&#xD;
"Miss Cheriton 1"&#xD;
"Yes," said Miss Cheriton, in a tone&#xD;
which scarcely sounded like her own, so en-&#xD;
tirely was she overwhelmed by a flood of mor-&#xD;
tified rage, and thatkeen, bitter sense of be-&#xD;
trayal which is certainly the hardest thing in&#xD;
the world to bear. "Yes, Miss Trefalden, it&#xD;
is I I You did not count on a witness to your&#xD;
love-scene, I suppose; but I could not resist&#xD;
the temptation of letting you know that I&#xD;
bad unintentionally been one, and of express-&#xD;
ing "-she nearly choked here-" my appre-&#xD;
ciation of tbat fine sense of honor which&#xD;
seems, in an especial manner, to distinguish&#xD;
your family."&#xD;
"Louise," said Trefald~n, hastily stepping&#xD;
forward, "you do not understand-you are&#xD;
laboring under a great mistake. You.-"&#xD;
"Will you be kind enough to keep back?"&#xD;
said she, recoiling from his hand, and looking&#xD;
et him with eyes of fiery scorn. "How do&#xD;
you presume to address me, after-after what&#xD;
I heard? Do you imagine that I will ever&#xD;
speak to you again? Do you suppose that&#xD;
oar engagement does not end this moment?&#xD;
Do yen think that to-morrow I 'will recognize&#xD;
you as an acquaintance? If I were a man, I&#xD;
might tell you whatltbink ofyon-butawoin-&#xD;
an is debarred even from the use of words I,'&#xD;
"Tell me, by all means," said he, drawing&#xD;
up his tall figure and looking at her bitterly.&#xD;
"Perhaps I may be able to reciprocate your&#xD;
good opinion. If I have talked love to another&#xD;
woman, it certainly has been no fault of yours&#xD;
ifyouhave notlistened toitfrom anotherman."&#xD;
The truth of this taunt made it sting more&#xD;
deeply than it is possible for words to cx-&#xD;
press-all the more deeply1 teo, because Lati-&#xD;
mer was near, and could not fail to remember&#xD;
the overtures made to him less than an hour&#xD;
before. First crimson, then pale, then crim-&#xD;

ON'S RIVAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
son again, Miss Llheriton set her teeth, and&#xD;
answered through them, when she could suffi-&#xD;
cicnUy command her voice to speak at all:&#xD;
"So you think to excuse your own treach-&#xD;
ery by insulting me! Such conduct is in ad-&#xD;
mirable keeping with all the rest; but,&#xD;
whether or not it does you credit, I leave&#xD;
you to determine. As for your cousin "-&#xD;
turning to Helen, who stood by, white, silent,&#xD;
and stately, with one hand pressed on her&#xD;
heart-" I owe her an apology for my inop-&#xD;
portune appearance. It seems that, having&#xD;
failed with Mr. Latinier, she has successfully&#xD;
turned her attention to yourself."&#xD;
"With regard to Helen," began Trefalden,&#xD;
In haughty anger; but Helen silenced him by&#xD;
a motion of her hand. Then, taking a single&#xD;
step forward, she addressed Miss Cheriton.&#xD;
"It is useless for me to say how much I&#xD;
regret that this scene should have occurred,"&#xD;
she said, quietly. "Since it has done so, I&#xD;
see nothing for me but to retire from it. My&#xD;
justification rests with my cousin; and, un-&#xD;
der any circumstances, I decline to enter into&#xD;
a recrimination of charges which I have toq&#xD;
much self-respect either to notice or resent."&#xD;
Her tone, her manner, her whole bearing,&#xD;
was so full of rare and perfect dignity that,&#xD;
for a moment, she almost seemed to elevate&#xD;
the scene in which she chanced to play a&#xD;
part, and, for a moment, absolutely made the&#xD;
angry woman before her realize the humili-&#xD;
ating folly of her passionate outbreak. But&#xD;
it was only for a moment. The calm tones&#xD;
had scarcely ceased to speak, when a scorn-&#xD;
ful answer was returned.&#xD;
"It would have been fortunate if your&#xD;
self-respect had asserted itself a little sooner,&#xD;
Miss Trefalden-let us say, for example, be.&#xD;
fore you became a plaything for two men,&#xD;
neither of wham has ever dreamed of* any&#xD;
thing but his own amusement."&#xD;
Hardly had these words been uttered,&#xD;
when, to the astonishment of both Helen and&#xD;
Trefalden, Latimer stepped forward from the&#xD;
leafy screen where he had still lingered, and,&#xD;
taking his place by Helen's side, coolly ad.&#xD;
dressed Miss Cheriton:&#xD;
"You have done me the honor of associ-&#xD;
ating my name with that of Miss Trefalden,"&#xD;
he said. "I hope she will forgive me for&#xD;
making such a declaration in public, but, in&#xD;
reply to your last remark, there is nothing&#xD;
left me but to say that I love her as a man&#xD;
only loves the woman whom he wishes to&#xD;
&#xD;
marry, and that my most earnest hope is that&#xD;
this love will one day enable me to win her."&#xD;
For a minute these words were followed&#xD;
by an absolute stillness. Knowing only the&#xD;
artificial side of this man's character, two, at&#xD;
least, of his astonished listeners were unable&#xD;
to realize that it was indeed he who 'made&#xD;
this simple expression of frank resolution&#xD;
and earnest meaning. They looked at him in&#xD;
half-incredulous amazement, while he-well,&#xD;
it is doubtful whether, at that instant, he did&#xD;
not forget their very existence. .At the con-&#xD;
clusion of his sentence, he turned toward&#xD;
Helen, and met her soft, dark, pathetic eyes.&#xD;
For a minute, they stood looking at each&#xD;
other in silence. Then Miss Trefalden ex-&#xD;
tended her hand, with a gesture which Lati.&#xD;
mer never forgot-extended it , not as she&#xD;
might have done to a lover, but rather as to&#xD;
a friend who had performed some generous&#xD;
service in her behalf.&#xD;

"Thank you," she said, softly, with the&#xD;
graceful and gracious charm which Nature&#xD;
headset like a royal seal upon her. "You&#xD;
arevery good-very kind. 1 understand why&#xD;
you have spoken, but you must try to for-&#xD;
get-" She stopped suddenly, and pressed&#xD;
both hands ever her heart. Something like&#xD;
a look of terror came into her eyes. She&#xD;
struggled for a moment with an incapacity to&#xD;
speak, then, saying brokenly, "It is too&#xD;
late!" fell forward.&#xD;
Latimer caught her in his arms, and, kneel-&#xD;
ing with one knee on the ground, supported&#xD;
her figure. At first he thought she had only&#xD;
fainted-but, in a few minutes, the awful&#xD;
truth came to him. The fierce strain of emo-&#xD;
tion had done its work with merciful quick-&#xD;
ness. Too much of sharp tension had been&#xD;
laid on the heart, and the great organ of life&#xD;
had ceased its work forever. Miss Cheriton's&#xD;
unintentional rival lay dead before her.&#xD;

MY S T ORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
tall oaks seemed pointing like spectral fingers&#xD;
to the lowering sky. It was not a particular-&#xD;
ly cheerful afternoon for out-door exercise;&#xD;
but down the steps I went, and was soon&#xD;
tramping along the avenue as if Intent on an&#xD;
errand of life and death. How clearly I re-&#xD;
call, at this moment, the peculiar, pungent&#xD;
odor of the dead leaves over which I trod!I&#xD;
If I should live to count fourscore years, I&#xD;
think this fragrance of the autumn will al-&#xD;
ways bring back with strange vividness that&#xD;
gray afternoon rapidly closing into twilIght,&#xD;
the sobbing miserere which the bare trees&#xD;
seemed to be sighing over their fallen glory,&#xD;
and the 'shabby little figure in a much-worn&#xD;
shawl, executing a movement very like a mili-&#xD;
tary "double-quick" toward the gate.&#xD;
Fortunately, this gate was not very dis-&#xD;
tant, and I reached it before long. There I&#xD;
paused, and, leaning my head against the&#xD;
bars, looked as wistfully through them as if&#xD;
I had been a Peri, and the common, beaten&#xD;
high-road running past, a paradise. As I&#xD;
look, I remember that a wild desire came&#xD;
over me to lift the heavy latch and go forth&#xD;
to the freedom which lay beyond. What if I&#xD;
was but a girl-a homeless waif whom Uncle&#xD;
Kendall fed and clothed out of eharity-the&#xD;
world was wide, and surely somewlhere within&#xD;
its borders I should find the loving hearts&#xD;
and the happy home of which I dreamed.&#xD;
God knows my life has not been a bright one&#xD;
since that time, but something like the pity&#xD;
which we feel for a stranger comes over me&#xD;
as I think of the desolate child who stood&#xD;
there on that evening--burning with a fierce&#xD;
fever of unrest, and pondering in the vague,&#xD;
&#xD;
AS clearly as if it were yesterday, I re-&#xD;
member that sombre November even-&#xD;
ing when I met Ross Kendall first. The lux-&#xD;
ury of a fire in my own room was an extrava-&#xD;
gance unknown in the close economy which&#xD;
governed the domestic arrangements of Ken-&#xD;
dall Manor. Tired, therefore, of my seat in&#xD;
a corner by the sitting-room fire; tired of&#xD;
watching Uncle Kendall's grave, rugged face,&#xD;
as he sat with an account-book open on his&#xD;
knee, running his bony finger slowly down the&#xD;
column of figures, and only acknowledging&#xD;
my presence by a frown if I made any noise;&#xD;
tired of seeing Mrs. Kendall (not wife, but&#xD;
sister-in-law and house-keeper of this auto-&#xD;
crat) nod over her knitting ; tired of the tall&#xD;
eloclk's drowsy ticking in one corner; tired&#xD;
of my odd, dog-eared volume of "The Days&#xD;
of Bruce ;" and most tired of all of myself, I&#xD;
rose at last, slipped out of the room without&#xD;
eliciting any thing more than a growl from&#xD;
my affectionate guardian, and, bringing a&#xD;
shawl down from my chamber, wrapped it&#xD;
about me, preparatory to setting out for a&#xD;
walk. ,&#xD;
Even yet I seem to feel the sharp, raw air&#xD;
-laden with coming rain-that rushed over&#xD;
me as I closed the hall-door, and stood on the&#xD;
broad stone steps which led down to the ave-&#xD;
nue. The sky was overcast with .lowering&#xD;
masses of gray cloud,iacudding along before&#xD;
some wind-storm of the upper air, and show-&#xD;
ing not a single rift in their sullen gloom.&#xD;
The brown earth was strewed with fallen&#xD;
leaves, while the gaunt, bare branches of the&#xD;

MY STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
wild fashion of' youth, whether she should not&#xD;
make one desperate effort to break the dull&#xD;
stagnation of a life narrow and sordid beyond&#xD;
any powers of expression.&#xD;
I had not quite decided the question in&#xD;
the affirmative, when I heard the sound of a&#xD;
horse's hoofs coming at a sharp trot along&#xD;
the road. I did not even turn my head in&#xD;
the direction whence the sound came. Some&#xD;
belated farmer going home, no doubt, or per-&#xD;
haps some one of the young gentlemen who&#xD;
occasionally ro~le past Kendall-sons of the&#xD;
large land-owners in its neighborhood. They&#xD;
were nothing to me-I knew none of them.&#xD;
Friend or associate, admirer or lover, I had&#xD;
not in the world. Shielded, therefore, by the&#xD;
gathering gloom, I kept my position-only&#xD;
starting suddenly from my abstraction when&#xD;
the horseman stopped.&#xD;
Stopped at the gate of Kendall Manor!&#xD;
I could with difficulty credit my eyes as I&#xD;
glanced round and found a horse's nose&#xD;
within a few feet of me, while his rider&#xD;
stooped to fumble for the latch. Through&#xD;
the falling dusk, neither horse nor rider had&#xD;
perceived the humanfigure leaning against the&#xD;
gate, and both were startled when I abruptly&#xD;
raised my face. The horse reared backward,&#xD;
his rider gave the reins a sharp jerk, and a&#xD;
slight struggleensued-the gentleman saying&#xD;
something which sounded rather forcible,&#xD;
but which I did not hear distinctly. Then&#xD;
he raised his voice and addressed me, whom&#xD;
he evidently took for a loitering servant.&#xD;
"Open the gate, if you please. You have&#xD;
frightened my horse so that he is afraid to go&#xD;
near it."&#xD;
I meekly obeyed, opening the gate and&#xD;
shielding myself behind it, as I pulled it&#xD;
back. The horseman rode sharply in-allow-&#xD;
ing his horse to look neither to the right nor&#xD;
to the left-and, touching his hat slightly as&#xD;
he passed me, said, "Thank you!,, I made&#xD;
no reply, for I was amused by his mistake,&#xD;
and did not think it worth while to undeceive&#xD;
him. After he passed, I pushed the gate&#xD;
back, and~ while I was lifting the latch with&#xD;
both hands in an endeavor to replace it, I&#xD;
was startled to find that, instead of pursuing&#xD;
his way to the house, he wheeled round and&#xD;
again addressed me.&#xD;
"I beg pardon," he said, "I should have&#xD;
asked before-is this Kendall Manor?"&#xD;
"This is it," answered I, briefly; and,&#xD;
having now raised the troublesome latch to&#xD;
&#xD;
its proper place) I turned round and faced the&#xD;
stranger-surely very much of a stranger who&#xD;
could ask such a question as that in Essex&#xD;
County, and at the very entrance of the Ken.&#xD;
dali domain.&#xD;
As I have sllid before, it was t~usk, but&#xD;
I saw with tolerable distinctness what my&#xD;
interlocutor looked like; not particularly&#xD;
handsome or particularly imposing, but a&#xD;
gentleman undoubtedly in air and manner-&#xD;
I had seen few enough gentlemen in my life,&#xD;
yet I felt certain on this point-a man who&#xD;
could not have been less than thirty or more&#xD;
than thirty-five apparently, who had an easy,&#xD;
well-built figure, a bronze face, with a pair&#xD;
of dark eyes, a firm chin, and a heavily droop.&#xD;
ing mustache.&#xD;
As I turned and gave the searching look&#xD;
necessary to take all this in, the stranger&#xD;
smiled a little, apparently at the coolness and&#xD;
frankness of my scrutiny.&#xD;
"Do you live here?" asked he, pointing&#xD;
slightly toward the old brown house visible&#xD;
through the leafless trees.&#xD;
"Yes," answered I, laconically.&#xD;
"Can you tell me if Mr. Kendall is at&#xD;
home?"&#xD;
"He was at home half an hour ego."&#xD;
"Thanks; good-evening."&#xD;
He touched his hat again, and this time&#xD;
rode away without turning back.&#xD;
I followed at my leisure-not particularly&#xD;
anxious to reach the house; since there was&#xD;
nothing for it now but the cheerless solitude&#xD;
of my own chamber. Once or twice a year,&#xD;
some stranger came to see Uncle Kendall on&#xD;
business, and on these occasions I was al.&#xD;
ways summarily dismissed from the sitting.&#xD;
room. Doubtless, the same result would&#xD;
follow on the present occasion.&#xD;
My surprise was great, therefore, when, as&#xD;
I opened the door half an hour later, and&#xD;
stepped into the hall, cold and tired, Uncle&#xD;
Kendall's voice sounded from the sitting.&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"Is that you, Beryl?" he cried; adding,&#xD;
when I answered in the affirmative, "Come&#xD;
here."&#xD;
With my shawl still wrapped around me.&#xD;
I obeyed, entering the sitting-room, where a&#xD;
bright fire made a most unusual illumination,&#xD;
and facing Uncle Kendall-seated bolt upright&#xD;
in his large chair-.and the stranger for whom&#xD;
I had opened the gate half an hour before.&#xD;
"Come here, Beryl," repeated my uncle,&#xD;
&#xD;
MY STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
S85&#xD;
&#xD;
as I paused just within the door, feeling&#xD;
strangely awkward and abashed. "Don't&#xD;
look so frightened, child; nobody is going to&#xD;
harm you.-.She has grown up here," he went&#xD;
on, looking at his companion; "but she will&#xD;
do us credit some day-eh, Ross?"&#xD;
The gentleman so addressed smiled, but,&#xD;
without making any other reply, came for-&#xD;
ward and held out his hand to me.&#xD;
"Pardon me for having met you so un-&#xD;
ceremoniously a little while ago," he said.&#xD;
"I did not know then that we were cousins.&#xD;
My name is Ross Kendall."&#xD;
Even those few words were full of so&#xD;
much kindness, that my sense of awkward&#xD;
shyness fled at once. I smiled as I gave him&#xD;
my hand.&#xD;
"I never heard of you before,~~ I said,&#xD;
"hut since you are a Kendall, I suppose you&#xD;
must be my cousin."&#xD;
"I have not had much time or inclina-&#xD;
tion to instruct her in family ties and con-&#xD;
nections," said Uncle Kendall, grimly. "She'll&#xD;
learn about them soon enough for all the&#xD;
good - or harm - they can do her! You&#xD;
are the best of the whole, Ross" (with a&#xD;
short nod), "else it isn't likely I'd have you&#xD;
here now.~~&#xD;
"I have 'been away too long to know much&#xD;
of the family," said Ross Kendall, gravely.&#xD;
"Thank God for it, then!" said the&#xD;
other, sharply. "Take my word, you'll&#xD;
never have any thing better to thank Him&#xD;
for !-lleryl, did you hear me tell you to&#xD;
come to the fire? Sit down there!"&#xD;
He pointed to the stool which .1 had va-&#xD;
cated a little while before, and I obeyed the&#xD;
gesture, subsiding into my familiar corner,&#xD;
and looking curiously from one to the other&#xD;
of the faces before me. What different faces&#xD;
they were, as the firelight flickered over them,&#xD;
bringing out clearly the prominent traits of&#xD;
both! At this moment I seem to see the&#xD;
strange, fevered eagerness that lit up the&#xD;
sharpened, haggard features of the elder&#xD;
man, and the grave, quiet, bronzed face of&#xD;
the younger, with its keen, bright, kind, hark&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
~Somehow my entrance seemed to have&#xD;
created a little embarrassment. They were&#xD;
both silent for sosne minutes; then Uncle&#xD;
Kendall spoke again..&#xD;
"I told you a little while ago, Ross," he&#xD;
said, in his dry, measured way, "that I would&#xD;
wait until Beryl came in before I let you know&#xD;
&#xD;
what business I had in view when I sent for&#xD;
you. I heard that you had' got back from&#xD;
China".-Uncle Kendall was old -fashioned,&#xD;
and he pronounced this Ohiny -" without&#xD;
having bettered yourself much; and, since I&#xD;
always had a liking for your father-he was&#xD;
the only one of all the kin I ever could bear-I&#xD;
thought I would take a look at you. You are&#xD;
like him," he went on, taking a very hard&#xD;
look indeed; "but I think you may do better&#xD;
than he did. You've got a firmer jaw. Firm-&#xD;
ness is the great thing in this world, lad.&#xD;
You'll know that when you are as old as I&#xD;
am."&#xD;
"I know it now," said Ross Kendall, very&#xD;
grimly.&#xD;
the" The sooner you learn it, the better,"&#xD;
other. "If you have that, you won't let a&#xD;
woman make a fool of you, as your father's&#xD;
wife did of him; you won't marry her for her&#xD;
pretty face, as he did, without caring if her&#xD;
heart is as black as Gehenna; and, above all,&#xD;
you won't be wheedled into leaving your prop-&#xD;
erty to her, so that she can marry again, and&#xD;
despoil your own son of every penny, as yozc&#xD;
have been despoiled. By G-d, boy ["-I had&#xD;
never seen Uncle Kendall so excited as when&#xD;
he brought his hand down on the arm of his&#xD;
chair with that vehement oath -"I have&#xD;
thought of your wrongs sometimes till I&#xD;
would have given every dollar I am worth to&#xD;
prosecute that woman, as she deserves, for&#xD;
robbery and plunder; hut she is too clever to&#xD;
give us a chance for that."&#xD;
"Let us rather say that my father trusted&#xD;
her too implicitly," said the other, coldly:&#xD;
"Let it pass, sir. I think of it as little as&#xD;
possible. In fact "-shrugging his' shoul-&#xD;
ders-" I have not had time to think of&#xD;
much besides my business during the last ter~&#xD;
years."&#xD;
"Have you made any money out there in&#xD;
China?"&#xD;
"A little," was the reserved reply.&#xD;
"Enough to keep you from going back?-&#xD;
for you told me a while ago you had no liking&#xD;
for the place."&#xD;
"So far from that, I suppose my em-&#xD;
ployers will send me back next month."&#xD;
"For how long?"&#xD;
"Another ten years, probably."&#xD;
"Humph I" said Uncle Kendall.&#xD;
For a minute nothing further occurred.&#xD;
The clock ticked; the fire burned obtrusive-&#xD;
ly; Uncle Kendall looked at the leaping blaze;&#xD;

MY STORY-.&#xD;
&#xD;
and I looked at the man who had come from&#xD;
China, and was thinking of going back again,&#xD;
until the eyes of this wonderful traveller turned&#xD;
on me, whereupon my own immediately sought&#xD;
the floor. After that I contented myself with&#xD;
looking at the drugget-fceling, the while, ex-&#xD;
ceedingly hot and uncomfortable-until the&#xD;
voice which I knew so well, and (Ood forgive&#xD;
me I) disliked so intensely, spoke again, very&#xD;
slowly:&#xD;
"I'm an old man, Rosa, as you see, and&#xD;
I'm not a strong man, as the doctor tells me&#xD;
every time I meet him; so, of late, I've been&#xD;
thinking who's to have this old place after&#xD;
rm dead. It ought to go to some one of the&#xD;
name; but I don't know one that isn't a mer-&#xD;
cenary, unprincipled scoundrel-unless it be&#xD;
yourself. Root and branch, they have been&#xD;
the pest of my life for years, until I have&#xD;
sworn that I will leave Kendall and every&#xD;
dollar I own to the county sooner than to&#xD;
any of 'em. You are the only one that has&#xD;
never tried to make any thing out of me, lad,&#xD;
and I have thought more than once of leaving&#xD;
it all to you; but, then, you were in China,&#xD;
and I couldn't tell what you might have grown&#xD;
into. Now that I've seen you, however, I am&#xD;
willing enough to make you my heir-only&#xD;
there's one obstacle in the way."&#xD;
"What obstacle?" asked Ross. lIe spoke&#xD;
quietly, but I, who was looking at him, saw a&#xD;
sudden flush come to his cheek, and a sudden&#xD;
light to his eye. It was evident that the pros-&#xD;
pect of liberty and fortune was very pleasant&#xD;
to a man expecting to go back to China for&#xD;
another ten years. "What obstacle?" he re-&#xD;
peated, after a minute.&#xD;
"That girl I" answered Uncle Kendall,&#xD;
pointing his bony finger straight at me.&#xD;
To say that the girl in question was as-&#xD;
tonished st this unexpected reply, would be&#xD;
to say very little indeed. I was so much con-&#xD;
founded that I could not speak-I could only&#xD;
gaze, as if transfixed, atthe finger, and won-&#xD;
der what Uncle Kendall possibly meant by&#xD;
such an assertion.&#xD;
"She expects to be my heiress," pursued&#xD;
that amiable old person, after a minute, in a&#xD;
tone of great disgust.&#xD;
"I don't expect it I" I cried, indignantly&#xD;
finding voice at this. "I never thought of&#xD;
being your heiress, Uncle Kendall I- I don't&#xD;
see why you should say I did. I-I mean to&#xD;
be a governess, and take care of myself. 1&#xD;
told Aunt Kendall so yesterday."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Indeed!" said he, sardonically. "And&#xD;
may I ask what you mean to teach?"&#xD;
The blood rushed into my cheeks like a&#xD;
flame, and to this day I remember the keen&#xD;
throb of humiliation which made me hang&#xD;
my head like a hidden child. I had never&#xD;
been sent to school, but had grown into a tall&#xD;
girl of seventeen, with only such little smat-.&#xD;
tering of reading, writing, and arithmetic, as&#xD;
Aunt Kendall could give. Under the circum-&#xD;
stances, the governess idea was certainly suf-&#xD;
ficiently absurd; but, then, why need Uncle&#xD;
Kendall have taunted me with my ignorance in&#xD;
such a tone, and in the presence of a stranger?&#xD;
It was the voice of the latter which broke&#xD;
the silence-quiet, but with a kindness in it&#xD;
which I understood instinctively to be meant&#xD;
for me.&#xD;
"Beryl is the daughter of your niece, is&#xD;
she not?" he asked, addressing Uncle Ken-&#xD;
dall. "Certainly, in that case, she has a bet-.&#xD;
ter right to your fortune than L"&#xD;
"She has no right at all," retorted Uncle&#xD;
KendalL "She is a fool if she thinks so! I&#xD;
have always meitnt to leave the manor to a&#xD;
Kendall; and I should like the fortune I have&#xD;
spent my life in making to go along with it.&#xD;
But ake has to be provided for, I suppose"&#xD;
the scornful finger was levelled at me again-&#xD;
"and so I have been thinking-she is pretty&#xD;
enough, as women go-that you might not&#xD;
have any objection to marrying her, Ross. It&#xD;
would settle all trouble. I hope you have not&#xD;
been silly enough to burden yourself with a&#xD;
wife-eh?"&#xD;
"I have been too poor a man to afford&#xD;
such a luxury," answered the other. He tried&#xD;
to speak gravely, but my sharpened ears could&#xD;
detect an irresistible inclination to laugh in&#xD;
his voice. That tone proved a drop too much&#xD;
in the already brimming cup of my shame and&#xD;
confusion. Child though I was, I could still&#xD;
appreciate the indignity and contempt with&#xD;
which I had been treated, and burning tears&#xD;
of rage were in my eyes as I rose suddenly to&#xD;
my feet.&#xD;
"I am going, Uncle Kendall U' I said, in&#xD;
a voice which trembled from the same cause.&#xD;
"I-I cannot stay any longer. It is true you&#xD;
have fed and clothed me," I cried, passionate-&#xD;
ly; "but you have not bou,!lkt me, and you&#xD;
have no right to offer me along with your for'&#xD;
tune! I don't want any of it-I would not&#xD;
have any of it; but I-I think you might&#xD;
have spared me such an insult as this!"&#xD;
&#xD;
T&#xD;
&#xD;
MY STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
8~t&#xD;
&#xD;
"Is the young fool mad?" demanded Un-&#xD;
cle Kendall, too much surprised to be angry.&#xD;
"What the devil does she mean ?-Take your&#xD;
seat again this minute, JIeryl 1"&#xD;
But for once I was deaf to the voice of&#xD;
command. I rushed to the door, and it was&#xD;
while I was fumbling blindly for the latch&#xD;
that I found Ross Kendall at my side.&#xD;
"Come back, Beryl," he said, as he might&#xD;
have spoken to a child. "Your uncle did not&#xD;
mean to offend you. He is plain-spoken, like&#xD;
all old people, but he meant no harm. Of&#xD;
course, his idea was absurd; but why not&#xD;
laugh at it instead of taking it like this? I&#xD;
have a better one to propose, instead," he&#xD;
added, laughing himself. "Won't you come&#xD;
back and listen to it? By Jove, if you&#xD;
don't "-as I still retained inflexible hold of&#xD;
the door-" I shall order my horse at once;&#xD;
for your claim to Kendall is certainly better&#xD;
than mine!"&#xD;
"I have no claim!" said I. But curiosity,&#xD;
operating with the last threat, brought me&#xD;
back. Then, having placed me in a chair,&#xD;
Ross addressed himself to my uncle.&#xD;
"I have ten days to spare, sir," he said,&#xD;
"and since your letter was very kind, I came&#xD;
down, meaning to spend them at the manor.&#xD;
Now, I propose that, instead of talking any&#xD;
further about estates and heirships, we de-&#xD;
vote these ten days to learning something&#xD;
about each other. You cannot possibly tell&#xD;
how much or how little you may like me or&#xD;
trust me on closer acquaintance, while, as for&#xD;
this young lady"-he turned and looked at&#xD;
me with a smile in his kind, dark eyes-"I&#xD;
trust that she may at least learn to tolerate&#xD;
inc as a cousin. All question of any thing&#xD;
else we will waive at once. It is enough to&#xD;
say that no consideration could tempt me to&#xD;
offer myself to a woman I did not love hon-&#xD;
estly and for herself!"&#xD;
"The more fool you l" commented Uncle&#xD;
Kendall, in his usual candid fashion. "There&#xD;
is some sense in what you say about deferring&#xD;
the discussion of business till we know each&#xD;
other a little better," he added, after a pause;&#xD;
"only I am opposed to delays. We never&#xD;
know what may happen; and I had a fancy&#xD;
to draw up my will to-morrow, before I go-&#xD;
as I am obliged hr do-on a journey of five&#xD;
or six days. However, since you have a no-&#xD;
tion for waiting, let it be so! I only hope&#xD;
that when I come back you and Beryl will&#xD;
have made up your minds to take each other&#xD;
&#xD;
for life. It is all nonsense, this thing of men&#xD;
and women talking of choosing each other&#xD;
for love. The only sensible thing to do is to&#xD;
choose the person who can make you most&#xD;
comfortable. If you both agree to what I&#xD;
propose, I'll see you safely married, and then&#xD;
i'll draw up a will leaving every thing I am&#xD;
worth to you, Ross. I don't believe in wom-&#xD;
en's ever owning independent property. Mar-&#xD;
ried or unmarried, there's not one ef 'em fit&#xD;
to be trusted with it!"&#xD;
"-&#xD;
Our autocrat was as good as his word,&#xD;
with regard to taking his departure the next&#xD;
morning. He announced at the breakfast-&#xD;
table that he had business which would de-&#xD;
tain him from home several days, and thus,&#xD;
to our dismay, Aunt Kendall and myself found&#xD;
ourselves burdened with the entertainment of&#xD;
our new-found kinsman. We looked at each&#xD;
other a little blankly; but there was nothing&#xD;
to be said, and, after breakfast, I confess that&#xD;
I watched, for the first time, with sensations&#xD;
of keen regret, the diminishing form of the&#xD;
tall old vehicle and raw-boned horse which&#xD;
conveyed Uncle Kendall to the railway town&#xD;
of Exford.&#xD;
"Are you always so sorry when your un-&#xD;
cle leaves home?" asked Ross Kendall, ma-&#xD;
liciously. He was standing by me on the&#xD;
steps, but I had not fancied that he was watch-&#xD;
ing me until the tone of this question informed&#xD;
me of the fact. Then I started, and, feeling&#xD;
that I blushed, I felt also a strong inclination&#xD;
to be malicious in return.&#xD;
"I am not usually sorry at all," I an-&#xD;
swered, quietly. "In fact, I don't think that&#xD;
I ever was sorry before."&#xD;
"And may I ask the cause of your un-&#xD;
usual regret on the present occasion, then?"&#xD;
"Since you have asked, you have no right&#xD;
to be offended if I say that it is because you&#xD;
have remained behind!"&#xD;
"I am not offended at all," he said, laugh.&#xD;
ing, yet flushing a little. "But are you al-&#xD;
ways so candid?"&#xD;
"How could I live with Uncle Kendall and&#xD;
be otherwise?"&#xD;
"Candidly tell me, then, why you object&#xD;
to my remaining? I am a most inoffensive&#xD;
fellow, and would not harm you for the world."&#xD;
"Why should you wish to stay~?" asked&#xD;
I, impatiently. "It cannot possibly interest&#xD;
you to be shut up, in a lonely country-house&#xD;

&#xD;
MY STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
like this, with a tiresome old woman like Aunt&#xD;
Kendall, and a silly young woman like me.&#xD;
There are no horses, no dogs, no guns, no&#xD;
books, no any thing to amuse you I"&#xD;
"Suppose I would rather not be amused?"&#xD;
said he, smiling. "Suppose I would even&#xD;
rather be bored? I have not had time to be&#xD;
bored in a long while; and it is a luxury to a&#xD;
man fresh from China. So is a glorious In-&#xD;
dian-summer day like this," he added, chang-&#xD;
ing his tone, "a luxury worth coming back&#xD;
to enjoy! How it makes me feel like a boy&#xD;
again! ~ wonder if I might venture to ask&#xD;
the silly young woman to take a walk with&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
His gay frankness would have put even a&#xD;
shyer person at ease. Having no excuse&#xD;
ready, and being, moreover, mightily tempted&#xD;
by the golden day, and the soft, dreamy air&#xD;
(not to speak of the dark eyes and the ex-&#xD;
traordinary but exhilarating consciousness&#xD;
of having a man for a companion), the silly&#xD;
young woman in question readily agreed to&#xD;
go. We set forth, therefore,-and if it mat-&#xD;
tered-which it does not-I could recall every&#xD;
word, and tone, and glance, which passed be-&#xD;
tween us on that bright autumn morning-&#xD;
that morning long past now, which I spent&#xD;
like a very child in showing all my chiefest&#xD;
and sweetest woodland haunts, and which&#xD;
was crowned by th6 wholesale rifling of a&#xD;
chestnut-tree upon which we chanced on our&#xD;
homeward route. As we walked, we talked&#xD;
not a little, and, by a few questions, Ross&#xD;
drew from me all about my own history-of&#xD;
which there was very little to tell-and I&#xD;
think it was his sincere pity for my lonely,&#xD;
joyless youth, which first opened my heart&#xD;
to him. Does anybody wonder that I did not&#xD;
resent this feeling, as I am told people mostly&#xD;
do? I can only say in reply that it should&#xD;
be remembered that nobody had ever before&#xD;
taken the trouble even to pity me. Besides&#xD;
which, when Ross said, " Poor child!" there&#xD;
was much of tenderness as well as pity in his&#xD;
voice; and, child or woman, she would have&#xD;
been made of strange material indeed, who&#xD;
resented any word of tenderness from Ross&#xD;
Xendall's lips.&#xD;
Well, it was a pleasant day. It is a pleas-&#xD;
ant day to look back upon even now, for it&#xD;
was only the beginning of others more pleas-&#xD;
ant still. It is fortunate, perhaps, that I&#xD;
cannot linger over the details of a story&#xD;
which just here would seem, no doubt, com-&#xD;
&#xD;
monpiace enough. Once in our lives, para-&#xD;
dise opens for all of us out of the dull earth;&#xD;
and days, golden with the light of tender ro-&#xD;
mance, shine upon us with a radiance like&#xD;
unto no other radiance of time. Does it boot&#xD;
to count the cost of the bitter desolation&#xD;
which often follows? We can scarcely think&#xD;
that Eve would have surrendered one memory&#xD;
of Eden for all the joys of earth. Yet she&#xD;
must have dreamed many times of the deep.&#xD;
green bowers, the shining waters, the mar-&#xD;
vellous glistening fruits of that fair domain,&#xD;
and waked to weep such tears of unavailing&#xD;
regret as have watered this sad planet of ours&#xD;
most plenteously ever since.&#xD;
It was in the midst of my colorless life,&#xD;
in the season of earth's most touching sad-&#xD;
ness, that some days like those of which I&#xD;
have spoken came to me. Surrounded now&#xD;
by sorrow and desolation-full of pain and&#xD;
weariness-I can thank God for them yet.&#xD;
Opening a drawer in the desk at which I am&#xD;
writing, some relics of them lie before me-&#xD;
changed, as the years which have passed since&#xD;
then have no doubt changed me, too. Brown&#xD;
leaves, once golden and scarlet with the burn-&#xD;
ing touch of autumn-v-leaves gathered out on&#xD;
the hill-side with Ross-a sketch~of me which&#xD;
he made one day on the blank leaf of a book,&#xD;
with "Little Red Riding - hood" scrawled&#xD;
lazily underneath; a few other trifles equally&#xD;
insignificant, and one short curl of crisp, dark&#xD;
hair. Few as they arc-these tokens of the&#xD;
past-they open the whole treasure-house of&#xD;
memory to me. They bring back vividly&#xD;
those lovely days with their wealth of unfor-&#xD;
gotten words and tones, their soft breezes&#xD;
and faint woodland fragrances. I seem to&#xD;
meet the dark eyes, to hear the frank, kind&#xD;
voice, and, if I lift my eyes to a present and&#xD;
a future which are alike desolate, I can still&#xD;
thank God that love-even our poor human&#xD;
love-stands forever chief among the Immor-&#xD;
tals.&#xD;
Uncle Kendall was gone nearly a fort-&#xD;
night. To say that I lived an enchanted life&#xD;
during this time, would be to say very little&#xD;
indeed. For let it be remembered-ia justi-&#xD;
fication, perhaps, of my folly-that I had&#xD;
never before had even so much as a kitten to&#xD;
love. In my case there was no dividing and&#xD;
subdividing of affection into different rills-&#xD;
no father, mother, sisters, brothers, friends,&#xD;
to claim a share of my heart. AU the love&#xD;
which was mine to give, swept into one great&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MY STORY-.&#xD;
&#xD;
channel, and poured itself-for good or ill-&#xD;
at one man's feet. Looking back now, I can-&#xD;
not regret it. It was something-nay, I am&#xD;
still mad enough to think it was every thing&#xD;
-to have lived in the light of his smile for&#xD;
ten long, golden days, and heard him say a&#xD;
thousand times in accent before he ever said&#xD;
in words, that he loved me.&#xD;
When at last he did speak, it seemed like&#xD;
something which had been long acknowledged&#xD;
and believed. We were sitting on a sunny&#xD;
hill-side-how well I remember the golden,&#xD;
dreamy beauty of that Indian-summer after-&#xD;
noon !-with a glorious sweep of country at&#xD;
our feet, clad in the gorgeous robes, and&#xD;
draped with the lovely haze of autumn. I&#xD;
had gathered from the ground two or three&#xD;
brilliant leaves-the same which lie before&#xD;
me now so brown and crisp-and, with the&#xD;
coquetry inborn in woman, laid them against&#xD;
therich masses of my hair.&#xD;
"Are they pretty?" I asked, looking up&#xD;
at Ross with the eyes which I knew full well&#xD;
were like the summer sky at noonday.&#xD;
lie smiled a little.&#xD;
"Why do you ask 2" he said. "You&#xD;
know they are pretty-almost as pretty as&#xD;
you are!"&#xD;
"Am I pretty?" asked I, quickly. "Do&#xD;
you really think so? I-I should like tobe."&#xD;
"Why should you like it?" he asked, in&#xD;
turn, looking at me with a strange intentness&#xD;
in his dark eyes.&#xD;
"Because I am sure it must be the great-&#xD;
est gift a woman can possess," I answered,&#xD;
readily. "It must be pleasant, I think, to&#xD;
know that one has the power to win love any.&#xD;
where and under any circumstances."&#xD;
"Then you are like all other women," he&#xD;
said, a little bitterly. "You long not for one&#xD;
slave but for a thousand; you want beauty,&#xD;
not to gladden one man's eyes, bat to give&#xD;
power over many. Well "-he drew in his&#xD;
breath a little quickly-" be satisfied, You&#xD;
have it! It is yours in greater degree than I&#xD;
have ever before known it bestowed on any&#xD;
one woman. If you go into the world-or,&#xD;
perhaps I should say wken you go into the&#xD;
world-you will find men enough to tell you&#xD;
this better than I can."&#xD;
His tone-which was almost harsh-took&#xD;
me so much by surprise, that for a moment I&#xD;
could say nothing. Then I felt hot tears rise&#xD;
into my eyes.&#xD;
"That was not what I meant," I said,&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
hastily. "I was not thinking of-of other&#xD;
men. What do I care for them? I was only&#xD;
thinking that, if I were pretty, you would like&#xD;
me better."&#xD;
"God forbid that I should ever like you&#xD;
better!" he said, quickly, "for I fear-O&#xD;
fleryl, I fear-that I like you too much al-&#xD;
ready. Child, don't look at me in that star-&#xD;
tled fashion. I mean every word I say. I&#xD;
love you, God knows, better than I ever&#xD;
thought to love any thing on earth again;&#xD;
but, if you came to my heart this minute, I&#xD;
should be miserable through fear of losing&#xD;
you. I loved another woman once, who was not&#xD;
half so beautiful as you are, and she deceived&#xD;
and forsook me. Why should not you do the&#xD;
same?"&#xD;
His voice, his words, seemed to cut like a&#xD;
knife to my heart. I have already said that&#xD;
I was little more than an ignorant child; for-&#xD;
give me, then, if I sinned grievously against&#xD;
all precedents of courtship. Don't be hope-&#xD;
lessly shocked that I extended my hands to&#xD;
him, backed by a pair of wistful, tearful eyes.&#xD;
"Ross," I said, simply, "I would never&#xD;
deceive or forsake you."&#xD;
His only answer was to take me into his&#xD;
arms. I think for a moment he could scarce-&#xD;
ly speak-so deeply had those simple words&#xD;
touched him. Then-but my story has noth-&#xD;
ing to do with the words of fond folly and&#xD;
tender sweetness which were uttered out on&#xD;
the hill-side that day. They are buried long&#xD;
since-buried by the rains, and leaves, and&#xD;
sobbing winds of many succeeding autumns-&#xD;
for the seasons which come and go in their&#xD;
appointed course have never brought such an&#xD;
hour again to all my dreary life.&#xD;
The sun was setting when we took our&#xD;
way homeward. Oh, in what bright and&#xD;
Lender colors does memory still paint that&#xD;
last happy evening! I seem to see yet the&#xD;
glow of sunset clouds brightening the whole&#xD;
landscape and reflected in the streams that&#xD;
took their way through purple ravines and&#xD;
smiling valleys. Even the windows of the&#xD;
old manor were all on fire, as if with a brill-&#xD;
iant illumination, when we came in sight of&#xD;
them. "It is in our honor!" Ross said, with&#xD;
a smile.&#xD;
When he said this, we were standing on a&#xD;
hill overlooking the manor from the rear. At&#xD;
our feet lay the old house, with the lazy blue&#xD;
smoke ascending from its chimneys, and its&#xD;
panes of old-fashioned glass blinking redly in&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="90" xml:id="VAC8071-00000051"/>&#xD;

the sunset glow; also in full view were the&#xD;
out-houses, kitchens, and stables, while far-&#xD;
thor baek-.-out of sight from the manor, but&#xD;
clearly visible to us-was a small cabin, with&#xD;
an enclosed piece of ground attached, and a&#xD;
rough piazza in front-one of those establish-&#xD;
nients which used to be so common on every&#xD;
Southern plantation, where some old servant&#xD;
had been "turned out ~to grass" after long&#xD;
and faithfulservice.&#xD;
"That is where old Sylvy lives," said I to&#xD;
Ross. "Did you ever see old Sylvy? No?&#xD;
Well, then, you ought to see her, for I really&#xD;
believe she is the only person in the world&#xD;
who is not afraid of Uncle Kendall. I some-&#xD;
times think, on the contrary, that its is afraid&#xD;
of her - he certainly treats her with more&#xD;
consideration than he treats anybody else,&#xD;
and, whenever he is sick, he sends for her to&#xD;
nurse him. They say that she used to be his&#xD;
wife's favorite maid. Fancy Uncle Kendall&#xD;
ever having had a wife 1"&#xD;
"And, pray, why not?" askcd Ross, smil-&#xD;
ing. "Uncle Kendall was not always an ogre.&#xD;
No doubt he was as good-looking as-as I&#xD;
am, for example, when he was young. He&#xD;
teas married, I know; but he quarrelled with&#xD;
his wife, and, since her fortune was settled&#xD;
on herself, and her temper was as high as&#xD;
his own, she refused' to live with him. They&#xD;
separated, therefore, but the law gave him the&#xD;
control of their only child, whom he accord-&#xD;
ingly kept until she grew into a girl, when&#xD;
she ran away and joined her mother. After&#xD;
that, he never saw either of them again."&#xD;
"Aunt Kendall has told me all about it,"&#xD;
said I," and I think she was quits right. If&#xD;
I had only had anybody to run to, Ishould&#xD;
have run away long ago. Tell me what be.&#xD;
came of her, Ross. Do you know?"&#xD;
"Dead long ago, I suppose," answered&#xD;
Ross, carelessly. "I never made any particu-&#xD;
lar inquiries, but I know that, as long as I can&#xD;
reme~nber, Uncle Kendall's wealth~has been a&#xD;
source of speculation in the family. 'Whom&#xD;
will he leave it to?' I have heard Kendall&#xD;
after Kendall anxiously ask - which they&#xD;
would not have done, you know, if his daugh&#xD;
ter had been alive."&#xD;
"I suppose not," said I. "It would be&#xD;
terrible if she was alive, though, would it&#xD;
not?" I added, with startling abruptness.&#xD;
"You would have to go back to China, after&#xD;
all, then, wouldn't you, Ross?"&#xD;
"That would depend upon circumstances,"&#xD;
&#xD;
answered he, jestingly. "If the will was made,&#xD;
Kendall would be mine, let who would ap.&#xD;
pear."&#xD;
"What a different Kendall we will make&#xD;
of it, will we not?" cried I, gayly. "Oh,&#xD;
Ross,,it shall bloom like a garden, shall it&#xD;
not? Are you not happy? Do you not feel&#xD;
as light as the air? See if you can reach the&#xD;
bottom of the hill as soon as I can."&#xD;
In the overflowing lightness of my heart I&#xD;
started-I was as fleet as a deer in those days&#xD;
-and ran down the sloping hill-side, carpeted&#xD;
with smooth pine-straw. Of course, I reached&#xD;
the bottom long before Ross; and, as I paused&#xD;
for breath, a small black figure darted at me&#xD;
from some unsuspected quarter.&#xD;
"Miss Beryl, granny say, will you please,&#xD;
ma'am, come there?"&#xD;
"What does your granny want?" asked&#xD;
I, impatiently. I knew very well that the&#xD;
" granny" in question was old Sylvy, whose&#xD;
cabin stood near by, and I felt little inclined&#xD;
for an hour's gossip over her rheumatism and&#xD;
asthma.&#xD;
"I dunno, ma'arn," said the boy-Sylvy's&#xD;
grandchild and factotum-" but she sent me&#xD;
to do big house fur you, and when she heard&#xD;
you was out in de woods, she tole me to keep&#xD;
watch till you come, and tell you she wanted&#xD;
pa'tic'lar to see you."&#xD;
"Psljaw 1" said I, pettishly. "Well, tell&#xD;
her I will be there in a minute."&#xD;
As the boy ran off, I stopped to explain to&#xD;
Ross why I could not accompany him to the&#xD;
house. "Old Sylvy wants to tell me about&#xD;
the dreadful 'misery' in her back, and how&#xD;
she can't sleep of nights, but has to sit up by&#xD;
the fire and smoke," I said, with a grimace.&#xD;
"I'll come as soon as I can; good.by."&#xD;
"Suppose I go in and offer her a cigar to&#xD;
let you off duty?" said he, laughing.&#xD;
But I declined this offer, and so we parted,&#xD;
he going on to the house with his easy, swing-&#xD;
~ng tread, whistling as he went; while I ran&#xD;
up the step of old Sylvy's piazza, and tried to&#xD;
open her door. To my surprise, it was fast-&#xD;
ened.&#xD;
"Sylvyl Sylvy!" said I, rattling it impa.&#xD;
tiently. "Let me in-it is I!,'&#xD;
After a minute, I heard a fumbling at the&#xD;
latch, then the door opened slowly, and Syl.&#xD;
vy's face-nothing more-appeared.&#xD;
"Is that you, Miss Beryl?" she asked,&#xD;
peering cautiously out.&#xD;
"Of course it's me1. "answered I, too im~&#xD;

patient to consider grammar. "Who els(&#xD;
should it be?"&#xD;
"I ax your pardon for kcepin' you waiting'&#xD;
ma'am," she said, opening the door with her&#xD;
usual courtesy-for Sylvy was a negro of the&#xD;
pld school, and often boasted that she had&#xD;
been "taught manners by her ole mistis "-&#xD;
"but a' body can't be too pa'tic'lar when&#xD;
they've got reason for wantliL' no tattlers&#xD;

pretty well this evening?"&#xD;
"Oh, I am always well," said I, with the&#xD;
boastful superiority of youth. "How is your&#xD;
rheumatism?"&#xD;
"About as usual, thank you, ma'am," she&#xD;
answered, in the tone which shows that an&#xD;
answer is absently given.&#xD;
This in itself surprised me, for Sylvy was&#xD;
always only too ready to talk of her ailments;&#xD;
but when I saw her carefully bolt the door&#xD;
again, I at once inquired what was the matter.&#xD;
"Why do you shut up your house so closely&#xD;

ribly warm 1" Which was not surprising,&#xD;
since a large fire was burning in the capacious&#xD;
chimney.&#xD;
"There's somc isn't warm, if it is a beau.&#xD;

ly and mysteriously. Then she pointed to&#xD;
the corner where her bed stood, generally&#xD;
covered with a quilt of bright and wonder-&#xD;
ful device, but now occupied, as a glance&#xD;
showed me, by a motionless and recumbent&#xD;
figure. "There's one as will never be warm&#xD;
agin in this world," said she, tremblingly.&#xD;
"You can go and look at her, Miss Beryl.&#xD;
How she ever got here, and she so fur gone,&#xD;
the Lord only knows 1"&#xD;
"What are you talking about?" asked I.&#xD;
"Who is it? Why didn't you send for Aunt&#xD;
Kendall if anybody is sick?"&#xD;
"Send fur Miss Kendall!" repeated Sylvy,&#xD;
contemptuously. "What I gwine send fur&#xD;
her fur? She's so afraid of ole master, she&#xD;
dasen't say her soul's her own. If ke'd a bin&#xD;
at home, I'd a sent for nobody!" pursued&#xD;
she, defiantly. ~' I'd a gone as straigl4 to&#xD;
him as my old feet could carry me. But&#xD;
he ain't, here, a~id I'm only an ole nigger, so&#xD;
I thought maybe you'd knew best, Miss&#xD;
Beryl, what's to be done."&#xD;
"I have not an idea what you are talking&#xD;
about!" cried I, bewildered. "What is the&#xD;
matter? Of course, if anybody is very ill,&#xD;
you ought to send for the actorr"&#xD;
&#xD;
"It's too late for doctors to do any good&#xD;
to ker," said she, shaking her head. "Come&#xD;
and look at her yourself, Miss Beryl! You&#xD;
ain't much of a one to judge, but you can tell&#xD;
death when you see it, I reckon."&#xD;
I had not time to resent the slight thus&#xD;
cast upon my powers of judgment, for she&#xD;
drew me toward the bed, and, hi the red&#xD;
light of the fire, I saw a sight which shocked&#xD;
and thrilled me. A woman, with a 'face of&#xD;
ghastly whiteness, lay under a heavy mass of&#xD;
quilts and shawls, breathing so faintly that it&#xD;
was difficult to tell at first whether or not she&#xD;
breathed at all, and with every line of her&#xD;
sunken face proclaiming, even to my inex-&#xD;
perienced eyes, that Death was indeed laying&#xD;
his icy finger on the feeble pulses, and saying&#xD;
to the heart, with that power which no mor-&#xD;
tal skill can gainsay, "Be still I"&#xD;
"Who is she?" said I, turning to Sylvy,&#xD;
who stood by wiping her eyes. "Good Heav-&#xD;
ens, the woman is dying I Who is she?"&#xD;
"She's Mass Kendall's own daughter, Miss&#xD;
Beryl," answered the old woman, solemnly.&#xD;
"She's your own flesh and blood, ma'am, an'&#xD;
she hasn't any better place to lay her head&#xD;
than the cabin of an ole nigger like me!"&#xD;
"Mass Kendall's own dau~,~hter I" That&#xD;
was all I heard. The rest of the speech-full&#xD;
of sorrowful indignation though it was-passed&#xD;
like the sounds in a dream.&#xD;
"Why, it was not an hour ago we sp6ke&#xD;
of her!" I cried out, stunned by the coinci-&#xD;
dence as such coincidences do stun; "and&#xD;
Ross said that she was dead 1"&#xD;
"I knowed she wasn't dead," said Sylvy,&#xD;
grimly, "an' ole master knowed it, too.&#xD;
Many's the letter he's had from herr but he&#xD;
never tole nobody about 'em but me. 'I've&#xD;
had another letter from yout chile,' he'd say&#xD;
to me, sneeria'-like. 'She's anxious to be&#xD;

I tried to keep her from it, poor lamb I but&#xD;
she would go, an' ole Sylvy ain't the one to&#xD;

said the faithful creature, sitting down and&#xD;
sobbing in her apron. "I was the fast one&#xD;
that took her after she come into this world&#xD;

&#xD;
MY STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
92&#xD;
&#xD;
of trouble, an' now-O Lord, Lord! to think&#xD;
that she's come back to ole Sylvy to die!"&#xD;
I said nothing. What could I say? A&#xD;
great horror seemed to come over and be.&#xD;
numb me. I sat down on a chest near by,&#xD;
and stared; first at the dying woman, and then&#xD;
at her sobbing nurse.&#xD;
"When did she come?" I asked present-&#xD;
ly, in an awe-stricken whisper.&#xD;
"Not more'n three hours ago," Sylvy an-&#xD;
swered. "I was 5-sittin' in my door, knitting ,&#xD;
an' thinking' no more of seem' keg' than of&#xD;
seem' the dead, when she come a-toilin' up&#xD;
the hill, an' stood afore me like a ghost.&#xD;
'Mammy,' she says, 'don't you know me?&#xD;
I'm your chile.' Then, when I fetched her in&#xD;
an' made her lie down-fur she was white as&#xD;
a sheet-she tole me how she was a widow,&#xD;
an' how she had bin so sick abe was afraid&#xD;
she would die an' leave her chile with nobody&#xD;
to protect him-you see, he's her youngest,&#xD;
an' all she's got lef'-so she thought she'd&#xD;
come to her father an' see if he wouldn't&#xD;
promise to befriend the boy after she was&#xD;
gone. But, though she come, she was afraid&#xD;
to go up to the house, for fear he'd shut the&#xD;
door in her face, as he said he would; so she&#xD;
come to ask me what she better do, an',&#xD;
while she was a-talkin', she begun to spit&#xD;
blood, an' it went on wuss an' wuss, till it&#xD;
lef' her right where you see her now."&#xD;
"And what are you going to do?" asked&#xD;
I, after another pause, and in another awe-&#xD;
stricken whisper.&#xD;
" That's what I don't know ,7~ she an.&#xD;
swerved, shaking her head. "If master was&#xD;
here, I'd go straight to him; but he ain't,&#xD;
you know, an' it's no worth while to go to&#xD;
ole Mis' Kendall. But I thought as how you&#xD;
-who's gem' to have every thing, 1~hey say-&#xD;
might take it upon yourself to have your own&#xD;
cousin carried to die in the house where she&#xD;
was born."&#xD;
"But I am. not going to have every&#xD;
thing!" I said, indignantly; "and I have&#xD;
no more right to give an order at Kendall&#xD;
than you have. In fact, Uncle Kendall would&#xD;
let you do it, before he would let me!"&#xD;
"An' is everybody to say that my mistis's&#xD;
chile died in a nigger's cabin?" demanded&#xD;
she, vehemently.&#xD;
Now, it must be premised that, under or-&#xD;
dinary circumstances, Sylvy would as soon&#xD;
have thought of calling herself a cannibal as&#xD;
a "nigger;" but at present she had thrust&#xD;
&#xD;
herself so entirely aside-her whole thoughts&#xD;
were so full of the wrongs of her dying&#xD;
"child "-that she did not hesitate to use&#xD;
even this opprobrious term to express her&#xD;
sense of these wrongs more strongly.&#xD;
"I-I don't know," said I. "It is ter-&#xD;
rible-but what can I do!' If there was only&#xD;
somebody to take the responsibility-" Then&#xD;
I stopped, and gave a little cry. "There is&#xD;
Ross!" I said. "I might ask him. He&#xD;
would know what to do, and he would not be&#xD;
afraid of Uncle Kendall either. Why did I&#xD;
not think of that before? I will go for&#xD;
Ross!"&#xD;
I rose impulsively and started toward the&#xD;
door, but, as I reached it, a low cry from&#xD;
Sylvy made me stop short. She had risen,&#xD;
and bent over the bed.&#xD;
"0 Miss Beryl," she cried, with a wail,&#xD;
"it's too late-too late! My chile is dead!"&#xD;
III.&#xD;
Wuau I left Sylvy's cabin, the lovely&#xD;
dusk which reigned over the earth when I&#xD;
entered had given place to absolute night,&#xD;
brightened only by that tender, fairy- like&#xD;
lustre which we call starlight. The air came,&#xD;
with a cool freshness impossible to describe,&#xD;
to my fevered cheeks, though magically soft&#xD;
for the season, as I walked slowly along the&#xD;
path-every foot of which I knew-that led&#xD;
to a stile in the rear of the manor-kitchen.&#xD;
It was not strange that, as I walked, I felt&#xD;
stunned and bewildered. The startling scene&#xD;
through which I had so lately passed had&#xD;
come upon me with the force of such absolute&#xD;
surprise that it might have crippled, for a&#xD;
time, the activity of even a stronger brain&#xD;
than mine. The pale, set face of the dead&#xD;
woman-the face which I had bent over, and&#xD;
which I shuddered to remember that I had&#xD;
even touched-seemed to go with me as I hur-&#xD;
ried down the sloping path. I could not ban-&#xD;
ish it, nor the flushed face of a sleeping child&#xD;
with a corn-colored mop of ?urls, at whom&#xD;
Sylvy had pointed sorrowfully, saying, "It's&#xD;
for him she come."&#xD;
For him! That Kendall might be given to&#xD;
him, and Ross sent back to China! That was&#xD;
the thought that came to me like a flash-the&#xD;
first, instinctive comment of my jealous heart.&#xD;
It had been my thought, indeed-though only&#xD;
vaguely grasped-when I first heard who the&#xD;
dying woman was. Does any one think this&#xD;
strange? If so, let me say, once for all, that,&#xD;
&#xD;
MY' STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
though I do not intend (God forbid that&#xD;
should intend!) to extenuate any of th~&#xD;
thoughts and acts which it is part of m:&#xD;
story to record, yet it is impossible for bin&#xD;
to judge dispassionately of this story, wh(&#xD;
does n~t remember that a young savage of th&#xD;
South Sea would have had a decided advan&#xD;
tage over me at that time in point of moral,&#xD;
social, religious, or any other kind of train.&#xD;
ing, and that I had grown up in such uttet&#xD;
isolation franz even the faintest affection that&#xD;
there was scant cause for wonder in the fact&#xD;
that I was ready to defend, at all costs and&#xD;
all hazards, the interests of the sole creature&#xD;
I had ever found to love.&#xD;
For it had come to that. As I walked&#xD;
down the hill-side path, I was conscious of a&#xD;
wild, fierce desire to keep these intruders at&#xD;
hay, and to defend Ross against them-Ross,&#xD;
whom they had come to rob and to send back&#xD;
to China! I paused at the stile when Ireached&#xD;
It, and, leaning my arms on the top, with a&#xD;
soft, soughing music in she pines behind, the&#xD;
cheerful lights of the manor-windows in front,&#xD;
and the great, starry sky overhead, pondered&#xD;
the problem-what could I do? Naturally&#xD;
enough, no answer came. Instead, even I&#xD;
had sense enough to see that I could do noth-&#xD;
ing. There was Sylvy, there was the dead&#xD;
mother, and there was the living child; while&#xD;
Uncle Kendall, who had already exceeded the&#xD;
time appointed for his absence, might reach&#xD;
home at any hour. In the face of these over-&#xD;
whelming odds, what hope was there that I&#xD;
-the most insignificant of creatures-could&#xD;
find any means to outwit them all, and secure&#xD;
to Ross his rights-I seriously considered&#xD;
them his rights -which were so gravely&#xD;
threatened? What difference did it make&#xD;
to me that the woman and the child in ques-&#xD;
tion were Uncle Kendall's direct descendants,&#xD;
while Ross was only a distant kinsman? I&#xD;
thought only of him. I fear that I should&#xD;
have thought only of him if the whole Deca-&#xD;
logue had been arrayed on the other side.&#xD;
It was while I still stood under the starlit&#xD;
sky, and still thought of many a wild, im-&#xD;
practicable scheme-loath to enter the house,&#xD;
because I had promised Sylvy to bring Ross&#xD;
to her-that I was startled by the ring of a&#xD;
familiar tread advancing quickly toward the&#xD;
stile. Ross was comifig for me! My heart&#xD;
gave a great leap-partly from the joy which&#xD;
his coming always brought, but partly also&#xD;
from relief; for I had been nervously dreading&#xD;
&#xD;
93&#xD;
&#xD;
I his arrival all the while I was in Sylvy's cabin.&#xD;
a That I had no high. sentiments of honor my-&#xD;
~ self; I think my story amply proves; but still&#xD;
I could understand Ross and I felt instinctive-&#xD;
ly that all the chivalry of his nature would&#xD;
rise up for that pale, dea~l mother and her&#xD;
helpless child, if he saw them. Therefore, my&#xD;
first thought was one of relief that he had not&#xD;
seen them.&#xD;
"Ross!" said I, putting out my hand and&#xD;
touching him, with a soft laugh, when he came&#xD;
to the stile.&#xD;
lie had not seen me, and be gave a great&#xD;
start.&#xD;
"Beryl!" he said. "Is it possible this&#xD;
is yee? I was just coming after you. What&#xD;
are you doing here all by yourself; and what&#xD;
has kept you so long?"&#xD;
"I stopped here as I came back from&#xD;
Sylvy's cabin," I answered, wondering a little&#xD;
if my voice did not betray what I had seen in&#xD;
Sylvy's cabin. "It is so beautiful I was in&#xD;
no hurry to go in. Did you ever see a love-&#xD;
lier night, Ross? Look at that splendid&#xD;
planet! Is it Jupiter, do you think? And&#xD;
there are the Pointers and the Milky-Way,&#xD;
and-"&#xD;
"Yes," said Ross, interrupting my vague&#xD;
astronomical knowledge. "But I have come&#xD;
for you in haste, Beryl. Your uncle is very&#xD;
ill, and wishes to see you." -&#xD;
"Uncle Kendall!" I exclaimed. It was&#xD;
a good thing we were in the dark, and that&#xD;
he could not see my start, nor the pallor&#xD;
which overspread my face. "I-this is very&#xD;
strange. When did he come, Ross?"&#xD;
"He was in the house when I reached it&#xD;
two hours ago," Ross answered. "They told&#xD;
me he had arrived about an hour before that.&#xD;
He sat down in the sitting-room alone~ and&#xD;
when I came in I found him fallen over with&#xD;
a stroke of paralysis."&#xD;
"0 Ross!"&#xD;
"I applied some remedies myself; and!&#xD;
sent post-haste for a doctor, who came much&#xD;
sooner than I expected. He is better now--&#xD;
that is, he can speak a little, and he asked at&#xD;
once for his lawyer and you."&#xD;
"Will he die, Ross?" I asked, in a whis--&#xD;
per.&#xD;
"So the doctor thinks," Ross answered,.&#xD;
gravely.&#xD;
After that I said nothing more. I let him.&#xD;
help me over the stile, an&amp;amp;walked by him in~&#xD;
utter silence toward the house. Since that&#xD;

&#xD;
MY.STORY'.&#xD;
&#xD;
night I have never trod that path; but I re-&#xD;
member every turn of it better than I re-&#xD;
member the scenes of yesterday-I remem-&#xD;
ber every thing connected with that night, the&#xD;
stars which were brightly glowing overhead,&#xD;
the soft sighing of the distant pines,' the crisp&#xD;
rustling of the dead leaves under our feet, the&#xD;
dark outlines of the house cutting against&#xD;
the steel-blue sky, the lights gleaming in the&#xD;
windows, even the very spot where Ross put&#xD;
out his hand and drew mine into his arm.&#xD;
"Why are you so silent, Beryl?" he&#xD;
asked. "Did I shock you with my news?&#xD;
And you are trembling all over, poor little&#xD;
one? Is it with cold?"&#xD;
With eold! .Ah, if ha could have known&#xD;
.-rf he could have seen-why I was trem-&#xD;
bling in every limb like an aspen. Robbery!&#xD;
It was not robbery to hold my tongue, to say&#xD;
nothing, to let the old man die in ignorance;&#xD;
and yet-I clung to him, quivering all over.&#xD;
"No-i am not cold," I said. "It is be-&#xD;
cause I am nervous that I cannot keep still.&#xD;
O Ross, do you-do you know what Uncle&#xD;
Kendall wants with me?"&#xD;
"Can you not guess, Beryl ?" Ross asked,&#xD;
gravely yet tenderly.&#xD;
After that nothing more was said. We&#xD;
entered the manor in the rear, and passed to&#xD;
the sitting-room, where the lawyer, the doc-&#xD;
tor, and an old gentleman, a Mr. Collins, were&#xD;
comfortably smoking over the fire, and talk-&#xD;
ing the current news of the day. They rose&#xD;
at my entrance, and, when Ross asked if there&#xD;
had been any change in the sick man, the&#xD;
doctor answered that there was very little as&#xD;
yet, but the sooner the business on his mind&#xD;
was transacted, the better. Then Ross led&#xD;
me straight into his chamber.&#xD;
It is not likely that I shall ever forget the&#xD;
scene upon which I entered. Indeed, it has&#xD;
been one of the nightmares of mylife. For&#xD;
years I dreaded to sleep lest I should dream&#xD;
of. it, lest I should see again-as I so often&#xD;
did-the twisted, helpless figure, the awful,&#xD;
distorted face which met my gaze when I&#xD;
crossed the threshold of that room. My&#xD;
nerves were already unstrung, and I shrank&#xD;
back piteously, covering my eyes with my&#xD;
hands-hut Ross led me on. "My poor dar-&#xD;
ling, you must come 1" he said, in a whis-&#xD;
per.&#xD;
,~And so I reached the bedside-~-so I stood&#xD;
shuddering an~d gazing into the harsh old face&#xD;
transformed so hideously. The mouth was&#xD;
&#xD;
wrenched into a ghastly and horrible grin-.&#xD;
even the eyes filled me with terror when they&#xD;
looked at me. I dared not scream, yet I&#xD;
could scarcely restrain the inclination to do&#xD;
so when Ross left me a moment and went to&#xD;
the head of the bed-bent over the lips striv-&#xD;
ing desperately to speak, and uttering only&#xD;
inarticulate sounds terrible to hear.&#xD;
"Beryl is here, sir," he said. "Will you&#xD;
speak to her? or shall I?"&#xD;
After an effort, there came an answer&#xD;
which seemed to mean "You."&#xD;
Then Ross held out his hand to mc, and I&#xD;
came tremblingly nearer, and placed my own&#xD;
in it.&#xD;
"Your uncle wishes to ask you, Ileryl,"&#xD;
he said, "whether you are willing to marry&#xD;
me, and to trust your interests hereafter in&#xD;
my hands?"&#xD;
"Yes, uncle," I answered, addressing the&#xD;
eyes which were fastened on me, and from&#xD;
which I could not remove my own, "1 am&#xD;
willing to marry Ross. I-I have promised&#xD;
to do so."&#xD;
Then the distorted lips, the paralyzed&#xD;
tongue made another effort, and, after a min-&#xD;
ute, wrenched out in broken, guttural sounds,&#xD;
the word "Now?"&#xD;
I did not understand, and looked at Ross.&#xD;
He seemed a little puzzled himself.&#xD;
"Now?" he repeated. Then-as he seemed&#xD;
to catch the drift of some inarticulate sounds&#xD;
the helpless man was making -he added,&#xD;
quickly: "Do you mean to ask Beryl if she&#xD;
is willing to he married now?"'&#xD;
The eyes brightened and the head nodded.&#xD;
Evidently this was what he did mean.&#xD;
"That is for Beryl to answer," snid Ross,&#xD;
turning to me with a sudden flush on his&#xD;
cheeks, and a sudden light in his dark eyes.&#xD;
"I am ready, sir. If Beryl says yes-"&#xD;
But I seemed to choke. I tore my hand&#xD;
suddenly from him, nud turned away-I say&#xD;
yes! How could 1, oh, how could I? It was&#xD;
not the shyness of a timid maiden which made&#xD;
me shrink from those tender, passionate eyes,&#xD;
that: close~eIasping, eager hand. God knows&#xD;
I might have been fourscore for all I thought&#xD;
of maiden shyness then.' It was a sudden, hor-&#xD;
rible sense of the deceit that enveloped me-&#xD;
it was the memory of the dead woman and&#xD;
the sleeping child in Sylvy's cabin! I was&#xD;
willing to do any thing that the princely for.&#xD;
tune, which that poor wreck on the bed had&#xD;
scraped and toiled and denied himself even&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MY STORY-&#xD;
&#xD;
95&#xD;
&#xD;
the luxuries of lifh to amass, might come&#xD;
Ross-willing even to hold my tongue ni&#xD;
let the sinful soul pass away without one o&#xD;
portunity to say, "Lord1 forgive me as I ha~&#xD;
forgiven! "-but all suddenly I felt that n&#xD;
soul was stained by this silence, and that n&#xD;
hand was not worthy to touch the one whic&#xD;
Ross held out to me.&#xD;
I turned away, and, walking blindly acro~&#xD;
the room, dropped down upon a window-sea&#xD;
Thither, in a minute, Ross followed me.&#xD;
"Beryl," he said, in a tone in which pai&#xD;
and surprise seemed struggling together&#xD;
"what is the matter? Are you angry wit&#xD;
me? I know it is hard for you to come s&#xD;
suddenly and so irrevocably to one whom yoi&#xD;
know so little-and I should not have dare~&#xD;
to ask it. But he is dying-the old mai&#xD;
yonder-and you remember he said, on tha&#xD;
first evening, that he wished to see us mar&#xD;
ned before he made his will."&#xD;
At these words, 1 raised my face. It cam&#xD;
to me like a flash, that every thing hinged or&#xD;
the marriage. Until that took place, the wit&#xD;
would not be signed which would make Rosr&#xD;
master of Kendall. I looked up with startled&#xD;
eyes into the face looking down upon me.&#xD;
"Don't you think Uncle Kendall would&#xD;
defer the marriage, Ross?" I asked. "Don't&#xD;
you think he might sign the will without-&#xD;
without that?"&#xD;
"lie might," said Ross, "though I should&#xD;
not like to ask it of bim-.-but I am not think-&#xD;
ing of the will. I am thinking of you, Beryl.&#xD;
Why do you hesitate? -why will you not&#xD;
trust me? Is it because you have not learned&#xD;
to love me yet? Is it because you were mis-&#xD;
taken - out there on the hill this after.&#xD;
noon?"&#xD;
"Mistaken!" Ah, if he could have read&#xD;
my heart! "0 Ross, Ross," I cried, "I love&#xD;
you better than anybody in the world! I&#xD;
have never loved anybody but you in my&#xD;
whole life. I would die for you, if I could;&#xD;
but I-oh, I cannot marry you!"&#xD;
"Do you mean never, Beryl?" asked he,&#xD;
growing pale.&#xD;
"No-oh, ne," answered I, with feverish&#xD;
eagerness. "I mean I cannot do it now-to-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"Why not, if you love me as you&#xD;
do?"                             sayyou&#xD;
"Because-oh, because I am not worthy&#xD;
of you, Ross."&#xD;
"Not worthy!" He smiled as he .took&#xD;
&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
to my hands. "My pretty, foolish darling, is&#xD;
~d that all?"&#xD;
p-     All! If he could have known what that&#xD;
re "all" comprised! 1 looked at him, andwon-&#xD;
~y dered he did not see it in my face-surely not&#xD;
~y the face of a girl shrinking only because she&#xD;
Ii loved&#xD;
"You said this afternoon that some one-&#xD;
;s some other woman - deceived you once," I&#xD;
t. said, nervously. "1-0 Ross, I may be doing&#xD;
the same, for all you know."&#xD;
a "You! "he repeated, incredulously. "You&#xD;
; -with that child-face, those angel-eyes? if&#xD;
b you swore it, Beryl, I should not believe it."&#xD;
o     "Not you, then; but - but some one&#xD;
a else."&#xD;
I "My darling, this is nonsense!" he said,&#xD;
1 gravely. "You are tormenting yourself about&#xD;
some childish fancy or scruple-but there is&#xD;
- not time for such things now, Beryl. Death&#xD;
will not wait for your decision. It is ad.&#xD;
dancing yonder very fast. You must decide&#xD;
quickly what you will do."&#xD;
I ' "Ross," said I, eagerly, "if he died with-&#xD;
out signing any will, to whom would the prop-&#xD;
I ertygo?"&#xD;
"To the heir - at - law," Ross answered,&#xD;
* "that would be yourself. Why do you ask?"&#xD;
he went on quickly. "Do you think that I&#xD;
am urging you to marry me on account of the&#xD;
will? If you can do me such injustice as&#xD;
that, Beryl-"&#xD;
But I interrupted him hastily. "I did not&#xD;
think of it for a moment," 1 said. "I only&#xD;
asked because I wanted to know-the heir-&#xD;
at-law means the nearest relation, does it&#xD;
not? "&#xD;
"Yes," answered he, looking at me giave-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
"Then, if there were others nearer than I,&#xD;
they would inherit it, would they not?"&#xD;
"But there are no relations nearer than&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Supposing, though- only supposing-&#xD;
that there were, could they break a will after&#xD;
it had been signed?"&#xD;
"Not under ordinary circumstances," said&#xD;
he. "But why do you ask such questions?&#xD;
Beryl, if you are thinking that this fortune&#xD;
might be you'rs-"&#xD;
"I am thinking that I will marry you this&#xD;
moment, Ross," I said, with almost feverish&#xD;
eagerness. "I am sorry that I have wasted&#xD;
so much time; but I did not know-I did Dot&#xD;
understand. If it is necessary for me to marry&#xD;

&#xD;
you before the will is signed, I-I will do it&#xD;
at once. Come-quick!"&#xD;
When Uncle Kendall heard that I had&#xD;
consented to the marriage, he seemed pleased,&#xD;
and desired that Mr. Collins might be sum-&#xD;
moned at once. "He is a magistrate," Ross&#xD;
said, in answer to my glance. "The legal&#xD;
ceremony is all that your uncle desires. Of&#xD;
course, the religious one can be performed&#xD;
afterward, it' you desire it."&#xD;
"I do not ear~," I answered, sincerely&#xD;
enough. It would have been strange if I had&#xD;
cared, considering that at that 'time of my&#xD;
life I knew no more of religion than that it&#xD;
was a vague abstraction, of which Aunt Ken-&#xD;
dall sometimes predicated (mostly when she&#xD;
was particularly out of sorts and out of tem-&#xD;
per) that it was all the comfort she had, and&#xD;
which was supposed to take people to church&#xD;
on Sunday when they had any fine clothes&#xD;
in which to go. I never had; so I stayed at&#xD;
home, and was edified by scraps of cynical&#xD;
atheism from Uncle Kendall's bitter old lips,&#xD;
which I carefully treasured and ponder l&#xD;
upon.&#xD;
Mr. Collins came in with the lawyer.&#xD;
Mr. Kendall had requested him to be in readi-&#xD;
ness for such an event (as the marriage, not&#xD;
the death) ten days before, I heard the lat-&#xD;
ter explaining to Ross; so he had the will&#xD;
drawn up in readiness for signing, and the&#xD;
license in his pocket. "The sooner it is all&#xD;
over the better," the doctor said, as he turned&#xD;
away from an observation of his patient.&#xD;
So, in that bare, ill-lighted chamber, with&#xD;
the distorted face of the dying man before our&#xD;
eyes, with the doctor standing' by counting&#xD;
his feeble pulse, with Aunt Kendall sniffling&#xD;
a little (purely because it was the proper&#xD;
thing to do) in the background; and with the&#xD;
lawyer now and then rustling his papers, Ross&#xD;
and I were married. Surely a ghastlier bridal&#xD;
never took place! Surely a bride never stood&#xD;
more utterly and desolately alone at such an&#xD;
hour! I (lid not think of it then, however.&#xD;
Never having known care or love, how could&#xD;
I miss it;? I had Ross. That was enough&#xD;
for me. 0 my God, that would be enough&#xD;
for me, I am often tempted to think, even&#xD;
within the gates of Thy paradise!&#xD;
After the marriage-after Mr. Collins had&#xD;
uttered those words which, even from his lips,&#xD;
sounded strange and solemn, "I pronounce&#xD;
you man a~nd wife "-there was no rush of&#xD;
c~ngratulat~on and compliment, such as I&#xD;
&#xD;
have seen since then at weddings, where love&#xD;
had a much smaller place than with you and&#xD;
me, my poor Ross,! Mr. Collins shook hands&#xD;
and muttered a few words, the lawyer and&#xD;
doctor did the same; I heard afterward that&#xD;
the latter described the marriage all over the&#xD;
country-side as "the most mercenary bargain&#xD;
he had ever witnessed." Aunt Kendall ad-&#xD;
vanced and shook her head over us. "No&#xD;
good'lI ever come of i1~" she said. "What's&#xD;
begun in sorrow isn't likely to end in joy. I&#xD;
never saw the like 'of such a wedding in all&#xD;
my born days-never!"&#xD;
Then certain inarticulate sounds from the&#xD;
bed signified to all of us that Uncle Kendall&#xD;
was impatient even of this delay. "The&#xD;
will !" we heard him trying to say, "the will!"&#xD;
Then the lawyer produced and read aloud&#xD;
this important document. I tried to listen&#xD;
and to grasp its meaning- for, was it not&#xD;
necessary that I should do so ?-but, listen&#xD;
as I would, the legal jargon was to me unin-&#xD;
telligible. I could make nothing of it My&#xD;
head was in a whirl. Did it give Kendall to&#xD;
Ross? Did it provide that he should never&#xD;
need to go back to China again? I put up&#xD;
my hand and caught his, resting on the back&#xD;
of the chair in which he had placed me.&#xD;
"Ross," I whispered, as he bent down,&#xD;
"does it give every thing to you?"&#xD;
"Every thing," he answered, quietly.&#xD;
Then I was satisfied. All that I desired&#xD;
would soon be accomplished. When the will&#xD;
was signed and sealed in the presence of the&#xD;
witnesses there assembled, all which seemed&#xD;
to me trembling in the balance but a little&#xD;
while before, would be secured to Ross. He&#xD;
would be rich and free, and could care as&#xD;
generously as he pleased-far more generous-&#xD;
ly than that stern old dying man would have&#xD;
done-for the boy with the flushed, smiling&#xD;
face and tangled, curling hair, asleep in Syl.&#xD;
vy's cabin. I gave a sigh of relief, and laid&#xD;
my cheek softly against the hand resting so&#xD;
near, it was a very toil-worn hand; and' I&#xD;
remember thinking, with a thrill of pleasure,&#xD;
that, after that night, it would never need to&#xD;
toil again. From first to last, God is my wit~&#xD;
ness, Ross, I thought then, as I think now,&#xD;
only of you!&#xD;
After the will was read, the signing took&#xD;
place. First, the paralyzed hand of the dying&#xD;
man was guided over the letters of his name.&#xD;
Then the witnesses appended their signatures.&#xD;
After this-which I watched breathlessly-&#xD;
&#xD;
NY STORY-&#xD;
&#xD;
90&#xD;
&#xD;
the lawyer gravely shook hands with Ross.&#xD;
"A very fine inheritance, indeed, Mr. Ken-&#xD;
dali!" he said. But Ross answered nothing.&#xD;
I think he felt that these congratulations in a&#xD;
death-chamber were out of place.&#xD;
Then, while we still stood grouped about&#xD;
the bed-.--watching the flickering breath come&#xD;
and go, and waiting for the end-a step which&#xD;
I knew suddenly sounded in the room beyond.&#xD;
How I knew it-how I guessed that it was&#xD;
Sylvy, who had heard of her master's illness,&#xD;
and was coming to him-I cannot tell. I only&#xD;
remember that I sprang suddenlyawayfrom]&#xD;
Ross-I seem to see yet, as in a dream, his&#xD;
look of surprise-and rushed across the floor.&#xD;
With all my haste, I was only in time to meet&#xD;
the old woman on the threshold.&#xD;
"Go back, Sylvy!" I said, catching her I&#xD;
arm. "Go back! You are too late. Uncle&#xD;
Kendall is dying!"&#xD;
"Dyin' or not, Miss Beryl, I'm comm' to&#xD;
him!" she answered, sternly. "You nor no-&#xD;
body else shall keep me back when I've got&#xD;
to speak for her that's gone, and the helpless&#xD;
orphin she lef'. It's no thanks to ~ I heard&#xD;
about him," she added, fiercely, "an' it's not&#xD;
you shall keep me away now."&#xD;
"But he is dying-he is speechless. What&#xD;
good can it do?"&#xD;
"Speechless or not, he shall hear ole Syl-&#xD;
vy!" said she. "You might as well stand&#xD;
out o' my path, Miss Beryl-l'm in.&#xD;
The Lord has sent me to speak for them that&#xD;
has nobody else to speak for 'em-and I am&#xD;
goin' to do it!'~&#xD;
"No, you are not going to do it!" said I,&#xD;
between my set teeth. We were standing&#xD;
face to face in the door-way-I tall and&#xD;
strong, she small and frail-and, as I said&#xD;
those words, I put a hand on each of her&#xD;
shoulders, and bore her back. It was so sud-&#xD;
denly and swiftly done, that she had not time&#xD;
to resist or protest. She gave way like a&#xD;
reedandlwhirled her-howI have not an&#xD;
idea - through the anteroom in which she&#xD;
stood, clear across the' passage, and into a&#xD;
sort of nondescript house-keeper's room, where&#xD;
Aunt Kendall mostly sat. There I deposited&#xD;
her in a chair.&#xD;
"You shall not go in there to disturb a&#xD;
dying man and make a family scandal before&#xD;
all those strangers!" I said then-silghtly I&#xD;
breathless myself. "The woman is dead-&#xD;
&#xD;
you know that-and the child shall be cared&#xD;
for better than he would ever have done.&#xD;
That ought to satisfy you!"&#xD;
"ilut it don't satisfy me!" cried she, as&#xD;
soon as she could find her voice. "It don't&#xD;
satisfy me - an' it never will satisfy me!&#xD;
Every thing ought to belong to him - the&#xD;
blessed chile-au' not to you nor that sweet-&#xD;
heart of yours neither. It's a sin an' shame&#xD;
to see hini 'at has a right to be here, turned&#xD;
out for them 'at has no right-an' so i'll say,&#xD;
as long as the Lord gives me breath I"&#xD;
"You are a most unreasonable old wom-&#xD;
an!" said I. "Did I make Ux~cle Kendall&#xD;
leave his fortune away from his grandchild?&#xD;
He knew he had a grandchild, didn't he?&#xD;
He hasn't left it tome, if that will gratify you."&#xD;
"Then he's left it to one with less right&#xD;
than you," said she, sullenly.&#xD;
This I did not choose to notice. "Go&#xD;
back to your house," .1 said. "You are talk-&#xD;
ing folly. The child shall be cared for, I&#xD;
promise you that!"&#xD;
"I should like for him 'at has a right to&#xD;
prQmise, to tell me that," she said.&#xD;
"You shall not go near him!" I cried;&#xD;
but as I spoke the door opened, and Ross&#xD;
walked in.&#xD;
Al the first sight of him I felt my heart&#xD;
die within me. Somehow I knew what was&#xD;
coming then. If I had had my senses about&#xD;
me, I should have gone forward at once to&#xD;
meet him and draw him from the room; I&#xD;
should have told him the story first myself at&#xD;
any cost; but, at the moment of emergency,&#xD;
my self-possession deserted me--as self-pos-&#xD;
session mostly does when it is needed-and I&#xD;
stood pale and silent, while he crossed the&#xD;
floor and came up to me.&#xD;
"My darlin"" he said, taking my hands,&#xD;
"it is all over. He is dead ~&#xD;
"Is he?" said I, with a gasp. Fool as&#xD;
I was, and horrible as it may sound to those&#xD;
who discreetly bury in silence the involun-&#xD;
tary emotions of their hearts, this news came&#xD;
to me with a thrill of relief. I do not remem-&#xD;
ber that I even tried to be sQrry; that I even&#xD;
gave one thought to the cheedess life that&#xD;
had ended-to the sinful soul that had gone.&#xD;
I only thought of Ross. Whatever I had&#xD;
done, the result was gained. He, was master&#xD;
nf Kendall now. None could gainsay that&#xD;
last will and testament signed and witnessed&#xD;
scarce an hour before.&#xD;
"So he is dead!" said I, shuddering a lit-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8071-00000056"/>&#xD;
98                                MYS&#xD;
tie. Then I drew my hands from the kind&#xD;
clasp which held them, and walked over to&#xD;
where Sylvy stood.&#xD;
"You hear that!" I said, in a low tone.&#xD;
"Now go! After a while I will speak to Mr.&#xD;
Kendall, and every thing shall be done that is&#xD;
right; but you must go!"&#xD;
I could not help a certain imploring ring&#xD;
in my voice despite its tone of authority; and&#xD;
this she caught. 'She gave me a quick glance'&#xD;
of mingled surprise and defiance out of her&#xD;
keen black eyes.&#xD;
"I'm much obliged to you, Miss Beryl,"&#xD;
*            she said, dryly; "but I'll speak to the new&#xD;
master myself, since I didn't git leave to speak&#xD;
to the ole one."&#xD;
"Sylvy!" cried I, grasping her dress as&#xD;
she strove to pass me.&#xD;
*              But she broke away and walked up to&#xD;
Ross, who was standing on the hearth-rug,&#xD;
looking surprised at this scene.&#xD;
"I ax your pardon, master," said she,&#xD;
dropping her old-fashioned courtesy, "but&#xD;
Miss Beryl's bin a tellin' me that ole Mass&#xD;
Kendall's lef' all his property to you; an' I&#xD;
thought I'd make bold to come an' tell you&#xD;
that his daughter's a lyin' dead in my cabin,&#xD;
an' that his grandehile's there too, with no-&#xD;
body to see after him but an ole nigge~ like&#xD;
mc."&#xD;
"What! ~ said Ross. It was scant won-&#xD;
der that he was startled. Such news at such&#xD;
a time would have been likely to startle any&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"Are you mad?" he asked, when the&#xD;
statement had been repeated. "What is the&#xD;
meaning of such a story as this ?-Has she&#xD;
been telling it to yozs, Beryl ?" he went on,&#xD;
turning to me. "If so, what does she mean?"&#xD;
"I means what I say," answered Sylvy;&#xD;
for m~y tongue clove to the roof of my mouth.&#xD;
"Go to my house an' look fur yourself, if you&#xD;
don't believe me, or ax Miss Beryl here. ,She&#xD;
can tell you, fur she seen Mass Kendall's&#xD;
daughter afore she died."&#xD;
"Beryl 1" said Ross. There are no words&#xD;
in which I can express the mingled amaze-&#xD;
ment, incredulity, and appeal of his tone.&#xD;
Then, after a minute's long silence, "Beryl,&#xD;
what does she mean? What falsehood or&#xD;
absurdity is this? Your uncle's daughter&#xD;
died long ago."&#xD;
"She died this evening! " cried Sylvy, with&#xD;
energy, before I could speak. "Them that&#xD;
said she died long ago was liars, that wanted&#xD;
&#xD;
TORY.&#xD;
what should a bin hers. She's a lyin' in my&#xD;
cabin dead this minute. Send old Mis' Ken-&#xD;
dall, send Mr. Collins, send Dr. Burton. They&#xD;
all knowed her when she was young. Let&#xD;
them say if it ain't true an' if I'm a liar!"&#xD;
11cr passionate, vehement voice carried&#xD;
conviction with it. I saw that in his face&#xD;
even before I heard it in his voice, when, after&#xD;
a short pause, he said, sharply:&#xD;
"If this is-if this can possibly be true,&#xD;
why did you not come and tell it before your&#xD;
master died?"&#xD;
"An' how was I to know that he was a&#xD;
dyin' ?.-how was I even to know that he had&#xD;
got back home?" she asked. "Nobody was&#xD;
goin' to come an' tell ole ~ylvy. Miss Beryl,&#xD;
site knowed who was in my cabin, but instead&#xD;
of sayin' a word fur 'em, she turned me back&#xD;
from the door when I come to tell ole master&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"Beryl!" said Ross again. This time it&#xD;
was a hoarse cry, and, turning sharply away&#xD;
from the woman before him, he came up to&#xD;
mc.&#xD;
"Beryl I" he said, taking my hands and&#xD;
gazing at me with passionate, wistful eyes,&#xD;
which seemed to pierce my soul; "for God's&#xD;
sake, tell me-is this true?"&#xD;
What could I say? I do not think I&#xD;
would have hesitated to lie, if lying would&#xD;
have served any purpose; but, even through&#xD;
the mist of my reckless folly, I had sense&#xD;
enough to know that facts were too strong&#xD;
against mc for that resource. I had instinct&#xD;
enough to feel that if I wished to make utter&#xD;
shipwreck of Ross's love and respect, I had&#xD;
only to add deliberate falsehood to criminal&#xD;
silence. Therefore, I could only look at him&#xD;
-at the face I loved so dearly growing white&#xD;
and stern before my gaze-with piteous, im-&#xD;
ploring eyes, conscious the while that my heart&#xD;
was rising into my throat-so young a heart,&#xD;
O Ross, and so untaught, that I sometimes&#xD;
think you might have been more patient~even&#xD;
with its deceit!&#xD;
I saw that he read my answer in my face,&#xD;
and that he would ask no other-then. He&#xD;
dropped my hands suddenly, and, turning&#xD;
away, walked back to Sylvy.&#xD;
"Come!" he said to her in a hard, cold&#xD;
voice. "Let mc go and prove this story of&#xD;
yours!"&#xD;
She followed him readily enough, and they&#xD;
passed out of the room together-leaving me&#xD;
alone. For a moment I stood bewildered.&#xD;
&#xD;
Had Ross left me like that? Ross I-Co&#xD;
whom I had done every thing? Then&#xD;
rushed after him-overtaking him in the pa~&#xD;
sage beyond.&#xD;
"Ross," I cried, catching his arm implo:&#xD;
ingly, "what are you going to do? - wh:&#xD;
should you care so much for this news? Thi&#xD;
will is safe. Every thing is yours!"&#xD;
He turned and looked at me. I thini&#xD;
sometimes that in my grave 1 shall remember:&#xD;
that look. Then he shook off my hand.&#xD;
"Go back, Beryl," he said, in a strange&#xD;
sort of voice. "I will come to you after&#xD;
while-but go back now."&#xD;
"Ross, I-I should like to come with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"It is no place for you," he said. Then&#xD;
he led me-gently, but alas! not tenderly-&#xD;
back to the room I had left, closed the door,&#xD;
and went his way.&#xD;
F~r a minute I was stunned. Then-well,&#xD;
I do not remember much after that until I&#xD;
seemed to rouse out of a wild passion of sobs&#xD;
to find Aunt Kendall standing over me, a&#xD;
glass of cordial in her hand, and an awed,&#xD;
frightened look on her meek, commonplace&#xD;
face.&#xD;
Of what she said I have little more recol-&#xD;
lection than if her words had been water and&#xD;
my mind a sieve. I only remember that she&#xD;
had been sent by "Mr. Kendall" to look after&#xD;
me, to put me to bed, and to see that I rested&#xD;
-and that 1 refused 'absolutely to be looked&#xD;
after, to go to bed, or to rest. I demancted&#xD;
to know where Ross was; but when I heard&#xD;
that he was superintending the removal of&#xD;
the dead body from Sylvy's cabin to the&#xD;
manor, I asked no more,' I only turned with&#xD;
a look that hushed even the garrulous com-&#xD;
ments on her lips.&#xD;
"I can hear none of that now," I said.&#xD;
"Go to bed. I shall wait here till Ross&#xD;
comes. He cannot be long."&#xD;
But he seas long-wearily, terribly long.&#xD;
Shall I ever forget the watches of that terrible&#xD;
night? I did not dare to seek him again&#xD;
~fter the repulse I had received; so I could&#xD;
~1o nothing but wait-pacing the floor mdst&#xD;
of the time in fevered restlessness, and listen-&#xD;
ing with heart-sick expectation to every step&#xD;
which sounded in the passage, to every one&#xD;
of the sounds with whjch the old house seemed&#xD;
full, the strange tide ~of life which Death al-&#xD;
ways brings In his train. It must have been&#xD;
very near daylight when, overcome by exhaus-&#xD;
&#xD;
ir tion and weariness, I fell asleep in a large&#xD;
I chair before the fire; and, when I waked with&#xD;
a start, Ross was standing before me.'&#xD;
He looked pale, haggard, and very grave,&#xD;
I thought, as the morning light streamed over&#xD;
~ his face; but his first words were full of con-&#xD;
a cern for mc.&#xD;
"Beryl," he said, "is it possible that you&#xD;
have been here all night?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered I, looking at him blank-&#xD;
ly, numbly, as it were. I remembered every&#xD;
~- thing perfectly-as perfectly as if I had not&#xD;
slept-but somehow my passionate emotion&#xD;
had all die&amp;amp; away, and a great apathy had&#xD;
I come over me instead.&#xD;
"But why did you do such a thing?"&#xD;
asked he, bringing a shawl from another part&#xD;
of the room and wrapping it around my un-&#xD;
resisting figure. "'It is enough to make you&#xD;
ill. I thought you had~ gone to bed long&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
"Aunt Kendall came for me," I said, "but&#xD;
I did not choose to go. You said you were&#xD;
coming back, and I-I thought I would wait."&#xD;
"But did you think I meant you to wait&#xD;
for me all night?" he asked. "How could&#xD;
you be so foolish? It will surely make you&#xD;
ill."&#xD;
"Oh, I am strong," said I, with a little&#xD;
weary shiver, And God knows this was true&#xD;
enough, else I should have died long since of&#xD;
sheer pain and hopelessness.&#xD;
Then for a minute there was silence.&#xD;
Ross stood and looked at me. I sat and&#xD;
'looked at the dying fire. 'The cold, gray day-&#xD;
light streamed in through the unshuttered&#xD;
windows, a cock was crowing in the yard&#xD;
without; I even remember that somebody&#xD;
walked across the floor of the room over.&#xD;
head, and I speculated vaguely concerning&#xD;
who it was. Then:&#xD;
"I did not expect to find you here," Ross&#xD;
said, abruptly. "I came in for a little quiet&#xD;
-for a little time to think-but perhaps it a&#xD;
as well that we should understand each other&#xD;
at once. I have something to ask you,&#xD;
BeryL"&#xD;
"Well!" said I, faintly. I knew what&#xD;
was coming, but I scarcely shrunk. Only-it&#xD;
is a gqod thing to think that there are some&#xD;
minutes of life which we shall never have to&#xD;
live over; and that is one of them.&#xD;
"Well," he echoed, after a second-and&#xD;
his very lips seemed to grow pale with the ef-&#xD;
fort of speaking-" I want to ask if it is true,&#xD;
&#xD;
MY STORY.&#xD;

100&#xD;
&#xD;
MY sTORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
this horrible story, that you kncw.-you, Beryl&#xD;
-~of the dying daughter who had come to&#xD;
seek herfather's protection for her child, and&#xD;
that, standing by that father's death-bed, see-&#xD;
ing him bequeath his fortune to a stranger,&#xD;
you uttered not one word to warn him of the&#xD;
heir who was so near-of the grandchild&#xD;
whom he ~was wronging so deeply by such a&#xD;
will ?"&#xD;
"Rave you not Sylvy's word for it?"&#xD;
asked I,' gathering myself together in the&#xD;
chair, and gazing steadfastly at the embers&#xD;
on the hearth.&#xD;
"Sylvy's word!,' he repeated. "What is&#xD;
Sylvy's word to mc? What is the word of&#xD;
anybody in the world in comparison with, or&#xD;
arrayed against, yours? Beryl "-he came&#xD;
suddenly forward and took my passive hands&#xD;
into his eager clasp-" say something to me!&#xD;
Tell me 'it is not so! Tell me that it is a lie&#xD;
or a mistake; tell me that it is any thiny&#xD;
sooner than true, and God knows I love you&#xD;
so well that I shall believe you in the face of&#xD;
every proof against you 1"&#xD;
Even yet I hear the thrill of imploring&#xD;
passion in his voice. Even yet my tears fall&#xD;
heavily to realize how much he must have&#xD;
loved the woman to whom he spoke like that.&#xD;
Poor Ross? It was hard on him when my&#xD;
dull, mechanical answer came-spoken as if I&#xD;
cared so little for his pleading or his pain.&#xD;
"But I cannot tell4you any thing except&#xD;
that it is true-quite true. I knew the whole&#xD;
story, and I said nothing!"&#xD;
"But why? Why did you not speak even&#xD;
to me?"&#xD;
I shrugged my shoulders a little. Such a&#xD;
question seemed so foolish. "Because I&#xD;
wanted the will signed," I answered.&#xD;
Then he let go my hands-suffered them&#xD;
to drop out of his clasp as if he had no longer&#xD;
need or care to hold them.&#xD;
"You acknowledge that!" he said. "You&#xD;
-Such a mere child-to love money so! You&#xD;
to plot for it in such a manner as this!"&#xD;
* This charge, from the very bitterness of&#xD;
its injustice, stung me out of my apathetic&#xD;
calm.&#xD;
"I thought' of you?" I cried out-" of&#xD;
you only, of you all the time! I ~wanted the&#xD;
fortune for you, RosS. How can you think I&#xD;
wanted it for myself?"&#xD;
"' how can I think otherwise?" he asked,&#xD;
coldly and hardly. "It is true you secured&#xD;
the fortune to me, but was it not because you&#xD;
&#xD;
could in no other way secure it to yourself?&#xD;
Do you fancy 1 do not understand now why&#xD;
you only consented to marry me when you&#xD;
heard that the will depended on your doing&#xD;
so, and that, without a will, the property&#xD;
would go 'to the heir-at-law? I was fool&#xD;
enough to think you cared for me then. I did&#xD;
not understand who the heir.at.law was, you&#xD;
see, or how your only hope of gaining the&#xD;
estate was to sacrifice yourself to me. I have&#xD;
thought it all over until it has almost mad-&#xD;
dened me!" he went on, turning away, and&#xD;
beginning to pace the floor with a quick, rest.&#xD;
less motion. "It seems so impossible-and&#xD;
yet it is so plain! Such a child-and with&#xD;
the very face of an angel-to have learned&#xD;
the lesson of her sex so soon and so well!&#xD;
And I, who should have known better, to be&#xD;
so entrapped," he added, with ~ low, unmirth-&#xD;
ful laugh-"1 who had known my mother,&#xD;
and that other woman who looked at me with&#xD;
eyes almost as frank as yours, and jilted me&#xD;
to marry another man when she found that I&#xD;
was poor. Unhappily, you cannot do t1~at I"&#xD;
he said, stopping again before mc.&#xD;
"Ross!" said I, hoarsely. My lips seemed&#xD;
dry and parched. It was like a horrible&#xD;
nightmare. Ross to believe that I only mar-&#xD;
ried him to secure the fortune? I could al.&#xD;
most have laughed at the grotesque absurdity&#xD;
of the thought.&#xD;
" How you shrunk from me," he went on,&#xD;
"when I first spoke of our immediate mar-&#xD;
riage! I cannot forget that gesture-it was&#xD;
full of greater significance than a hundred&#xD;
words. Then - afterward- how you forced&#xD;
yourself to the sacrifice because it was 'your&#xD;
only road to wealth! And now, with all your&#xD;
youth and all your beauty, you are tied to a&#xD;
poor man!"&#xD;
"Ross," I cried, "are you mad ?-what do&#xD;
you mean? The will! - you said the will&#xD;
could not be set aside!"&#xD;
"Except by the legatee," he answered, cold.&#xD;
ly; "but I have already instructed your un-&#xD;
cle's lawyer to draw up the necessary papers&#xD;
for making over the estate to its rightful&#xD;
heir."&#xD;
"Ross!"&#xD;
"You are shocked, no doubt," he said,&#xD;
still more coldly. "But even for your sake-&#xD;
thbugh I pity you from my heart !-I cannot&#xD;
accept a bequest which is so palpably un-&#xD;
just!"&#xD;
Shocked t I was stricken dumb and&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
motionless, rather. Such a thought as thi&#xD;
had never occurred to me for one moment.&#xD;
had fancied the will to be final and unalter&#xD;
able, and now-for Ross to talk of giving u~&#xD;
all that I had secured to him! I could no'&#xD;
speak - I could scarcely think! My ver~&#xD;
heart seemed to stand still.&#xD;
* "Set your mind at rest about your owi&#xD;
condition," he said, after a minute, in a kinder&#xD;
tone-pitying, perhaps, my white, stunned&#xD;
face-" I will secure a sufficient portion oul&#xD;
of the estate to make you independent-such&#xD;
a portion as your uncle would no doubt have&#xD;
left you-and settle it on yourself. That&#xD;
much, at least, I can do for you."&#xD;
For me! As if I cared for myself-as if I&#xD;
had thought of myself in what I had done!&#xD;
"Ross," I cried out, "do you know that&#xD;
you are killing me by such cruel words as&#xD;
these! What can I say to make you believe&#xD;
that I-I thought only of'you? I don't pre-&#xD;
tend to excuse what' I did. perhaps it was&#xD;
very wicked; but I was never taught any&#xD;
better. I did not think there was any harm&#xD;
in being silent; but, if there had been harm,&#xD;
I should have done it for you."&#xD;
"I do not doubt it," he said, bitterly,&#xD;
since, in doing it for me, you did it for your.&#xD;
self. Nay "-almost fiercely-" do not try to&#xD;
make me believe any thing else! You have&#xD;
duped and fooled me long enough with your&#xD;
lovely face and your wistful eyes. My God,&#xD;
are women always false!" he cried out, pas-&#xD;
sionately. "Is there not one of them true?&#xD;
Is there not one of them who will not make a'&#xD;
plaything and a tool of a man's love? If one&#xD;
could have hoped for truth in any, would it&#xD;
not have been in you, Jieryl? and yet how&#xD;
false and mercenary your own acts prove that&#xD;
you are!"&#xD;
I gazed at him dry-eyed and mute. What&#xD;
could I say to such words as these? Look-&#xD;
ing into his white, passionate face, I felt that&#xD;
all was over with me-that no protestations&#xD;
could ever build up again his shattered trust.&#xD;
In his eyes, I had schemed not to enrich him,&#xD;
but to enrich myself; and had used his ~as-&#xD;
sionate love only as the means to such an&#xD;
end.&#xD;
"I see you will not believe me," I said,&#xD;
piteously, after a while, "but I did not think&#xD;
of gaining the fortune for myself. I thought&#xD;
only of securing it to you-that you might&#xD;
not be forced to go back to China."&#xD;
"You were very kind," he said, bitterly.&#xD;
&#xD;
MY STORY,.&#xD;
&#xD;
a "It is hard on you that I shall need to go&#xD;
I back to China, after alL"&#xD;
He spoke with a sarcasm which I should&#xD;
have been quick enough to feel, only in the&#xD;
terror of his words it passed me by unheeded.&#xD;
All my lethargy fled then. I sprang to my&#xD;
feet, and, going up to him, caught his arm.&#xD;
"Ross," I gasped, "how can you frighten&#xD;
me so horribly? How can you say such a&#xD;
I terrible thing? You are not in earnest-you&#xD;
cannot mean that you are going back to&#xD;
China?"&#xD;
"Do you care?" he asked, suddenly tak-&#xD;
ing me into his arms. "0 Beryl, if I could&#xD;
but believe that you did! 0 lovely face, why&#xD;
are you not true? 0 sweet lips, why must I&#xD;
fear that your very sweetness is tricking&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"Ross, Ross, stay!" I cried, clinging to&#xD;
him passionately. "0 Ross, my darling, say&#xD;
what you please to me, believe what you please&#xD;
of zne-.--only stay!"&#xD;
"But I am a poor man, Beryl," he said,&#xD;
more gently than lie had spoken yet. "How&#xD;
can I stay?"&#xD;
Then the devil prompted me to cry: "But&#xD;
the fortune-O Ross, the fortune! If you&#xD;
keep that you need not go. And it was left&#xD;
to you-Uncle Kendall left it to you! He&#xD;
never meant for you to give it up!"&#xD;
Fool and thrice fool that I was! Looking&#xD;
back now, I think that, in another moment,&#xD;
my tearful eyes, my clinging arms, would&#xD;
have prevailed over his resolution to go, and&#xD;
that he might have consented to stay if those&#xD;
words had not undone all. He drew back as&#xD;
if they had stung him; untwining my arms,&#xD;
and putting me from him with a faint, scorn-&#xD;
ful laugh~&#xD;
"See how easily I am duped!" he said.&#xD;
"See how wrong your uncle was in saying&#xD;
that my poor father w~as weaker than I! A&#xD;
few tears, a few glances, and I was ready to&#xD;
believe in you again, Beryl, till you show me&#xD;
that you are thinking of the fortune-not of&#xD;
me! Till you prove that you are only intent&#xD;
on tempting me to dishonor, I see I must&#xD;
go," he said, after a minute. "I am not so&#xD;
strong as I thought-I cannot trust myself&#xD;
with you. At least, not until all is done that&#xD;
must be done."&#xD;
Then, not willingly, but as one who yields&#xD;
to a temptation too great to be resisted, he&#xD;
took me in his arms and kissed me many&#xD;
times-ah, Ross, did you suspect, though I&#xD;

never, that it was for the last time ?-then,&#xD;
putting me into the chair where he had found&#xD;
me, turned, before I could utter a word, and&#xD;
left the room.&#xD;
Left the room, do I say? Rather, passed&#xD;
from my life-passed so utterly that, from&#xD;
that. hour to the one in which I write, I have&#xD;
never looked upon his face again.&#xD;
Later in the day, he left Kendall, to ac-&#xD;
company the lawyer to Exford, where he&#xD;
found a telegram from his employers sum-&#xD;
moning him on urgent business. After sign-&#xD;
ing the necessary papers for resigning the&#xD;
estate, he obeyed the summons at once. A&#xD;
week later, he sailed for China. Before me&#xD;
lies a letter which he wrote me on the eve of&#xD;
his departure. It is cold and full of business&#xD;
detail-though breaking toward the end into&#xD;
a tenderness beyond his power to restrain-.-&#xD;
but, if you glance at its worn and yellowed&#xD;
pages, you will see that they are stained with&#xD;
the signs of many tears, salt as the sea and&#xD;
bitter as grief. Such as it is, I do well to&#xD;
prize it, better yet to weep, over it, for it is&#xD;
&#xD;
my sole token of the love of one who sailed&#xD;
away thinking that he left behind only a&#xD;
woman who had deceived him, and who never&#xD;
reached the distant Chinese port where her&#xD;
passionate letters-poor letters! I have them,&#xD;
too-waited for him through many a long&#xD;
day.&#xD;
And so my story ends. At least in all&#xD;
save my moments of madness, I think that&#xD;
so it ends. But the fate of the ship in which&#xD;
Ross sailed was never known, and I-some-&#xD;
times I am still weak enough to hope, to&#xD;
dream, I know not what, of wild, improbable&#xD;
things. Not long ago I read a poem which&#xD;
seemed the voice of my own heart. It is&#xD;
called "Returned-Missing," and is by Miss&#xD;
rrocter, I think. One stanza I cannot for-&#xD;
get:&#xD;
"Not that I dream or fancy,&#xD;
You know all that is past;&#xD;
Earth has no hope to give me,&#xD;
And yet-Time flies so fast&#xD;
That all md the lm~bo8sib1e&#xD;
Might le brought tach at last."&#xD;

THE END.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
I.&#xD;
"nj HROME.YELLOW," muttered Vance&#xD;
LorLmer, tossing over the heap of&#xD;
tube.paints that lay on a table by the side of&#xD;
his easel. "Lake.red, burnt sienna, bistre,&#xD;
gamboge-why, what the deuce has gone with&#xD;
the thing, Travers?"&#xD;
He raised his voice at the last word, and a&#xD;
young man who was painting at the other end&#xD;
of the long room, the skylight, easels, and lay-&#xD;
figures of which proclaimed it a studio, looked&#xD;
up and answered:&#xD;
"Well, Vance; what is it?"&#xD;
"H~tve you carried off the ultramarine? I&#xD;
can't find it anywhere?"&#xD;
"Ultramarine? I-on my honor, I don't&#xD;
know. probably I have."&#xD;
"Well, pray be good enough to return it,&#xD;
then," said Lorimer, in an impatient tone. "I&#xD;
have been looking for a tube of it everywhere,&#xD;
and wasted more time than the eonfou~ided&#xD;
thing is worth."&#xD;
"Take permanent blue."&#xD;
"No. I want ultramarine. What is the&#xD;
reason you can't let my paints alone?"&#xD;
"What is the reason you can't be friendly&#xD;
and obliging?" returned the other, with a&#xD;
laugh. "It is so mnch less trouble to borrow&#xD;
from you than to send out 'and buy. Here!&#xD;
be quick; catch it as I toss it to you."&#xD;
He suited the action to the word, and, as&#xD;
he spoke, a small tube went flying through the&#xD;
air, straight at Lorimer's head. The latter&#xD;
caught it deftly, and, having done so, com-&#xD;
mekeed mixing some of the contents on his&#xD;
palette. While he ~was occupied in this way,&#xD;
his friend watched him closely, and at last&#xD;
spoke, quite abruptly:&#xD;
"What are you painting on, Lorimer?"&#xD;
79&#xD;
&#xD;
"On a scene," was the rather unsa.tisfae-&#xD;
tory reply.&#xD;
"Humph! Considering the number, of&#xD;
scenes you have on hand, that is something&#xD;
like saying 'on a picture.' What scene?"&#xD;
"Come and satisfy yourself; if you are cu-&#xD;
rious.&#xD;
Apparently, from some reason or other,&#xD;
Travers was curious. He laid down his brush,&#xD;
and, with his palette still on his thumb, came&#xD;
down the room, and, walking round his friend's&#xD;
easel, paused in front of it. The first thing&#xD;
he did was to give a long whistle, then he&#xD;
looked up and said:&#xD;
"So you are at this again?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Lorime~, coolly, "I am at that&#xD;
again. It is impossible to help it, Frank.&#xD;
Every time I stop painting, I have the dream&#xD;
over again; and each time it seems to grow&#xD;
more vivid. Last night I could hardly believe&#xD;
that it was not reality. You may laugh if you&#xD;
like; but I tell you it is the strangest thing I&#xD;
ever heard of."&#xD;
"I am not laughing," said Travers, truth-&#xD;
fully enough. "I haven't the least inclination&#xD;
to laugh, Vance; for I really believe that, if&#xD;
this thing goes on, you'll turn clairvoyant after&#xD;
a while, and be dreaming dreams, and seeing&#xD;
visions, like the rest of them. If I had been&#xD;
in your place, I would have made a stand&#xD;
against it."&#xD;
"What was the good of making a stand&#xD;
against it?" asked the other. "It is all very&#xD;
well to talk in that way when you haven'tfelt&#xD;
the thing; but, by 3ove, if you had-"&#xD;
"I hope I shouldn't have taken leave of&#xD;
my senses, as you seem to have done."&#xD;
"How do I seem to have taken leave of&#xD;
my senses?"&#xD;
"Are not all your pictures lying untouched,&#xD;

and have you done a stroke of work on any&#xD;
but this for a month past?"&#xD;
"And how could I help either the one fr&#xD;
the other 1' I felt absolutely incapable of&#xD;
touching them, and irresistibly impelled to&#xD;
work 6n this. I have tried again and again to&#xD;
put it down, and shere is always some strong&#xD;
foree compelling me to resume work on it."&#xD;
"That is exactly what is the matter," said&#xD;
Travers, thrusting his right hand deep into&#xD;
the pocket of his blous&amp;amp;, and looking at the&#xD;
picture as if it had been a culprit, and he had&#xD;
been a judge ready to pass sentence of death&#xD;
upon it. "That sort of talk is not like you,&#xD;
Lorimer; and it sounds badly-on my honor,&#xD;
it does. A man can do any thing he wants to&#xD;
do; and, if that precious picture was mine, I&#xD;
would cut it up into strips, and throw It into&#xD;
the fire."&#xD;
"Is it such a daub, then?"&#xD;
"A daub? Confound it, you know as well&#xD;
as I do that it is better painted than any thing&#xD;
you ever did before, and that is what provokes&#xD;
me. The thing has acquired such a hold on&#xD;
you that you have put into it the very best of&#xD;
your power. Lorimer, honestly, I don't think&#xD;
it's right."&#xD;
Lorimer laughed, then looked up from the&#xD;
paints he was mixing, and'gave a glance, half-&#xD;
affectionate, lialf.critical, at the picture.&#xD;
"There's one thing certain," he said, "it&#xD;
has a look of reality-don't you think so?"&#xD;
"It' has a devilish look of reality," the&#xD;
other answered. "I could swear you had&#xD;
painted every stroke from actual sight. Vance,&#xD;
are you sure you never saw any thing like&#xD;
it ?-any thing that may have been lying dor-&#xD;
mant in your brain, and unconsciously brought&#xD;
forth' this?"&#xD;
"I am perfectly sure," Vance returned,&#xD;
decidedly~, "I never saw tbe scene, or any&#xD;
thing' resembling it, in my life. And as for&#xD;
the people, of course I never saw them."&#xD;
"You might have seen worse -looking&#xD;
ones.~#&#xD;
"Yes, I think I might. Stand back now,&#xD;
Franrerl, Iwant to go to Work."&#xD;
Travers drew 'back; but still stood by,&#xD;
looking on with a v~ry disapproving face, while&#xD;
Lorimer began toueh~ig the foreground of the&#xD;
picture. It was not a large or a very elabo-&#xD;
rate composition, nor was the drift of its mean-&#xD;
ing very plain; but still it was a painting at&#xD;
which any art-connoisseur would have paused&#xD;
to look, and in which the most severe critic&#xD;
&#xD;
must needs have found much to commend.&#xD;
There was an earnest signification underlying&#xD;
it, and a dramatic power about it which irre-&#xD;
sistibly enchained attention, and made even&#xD;
Travers understand the hold it had gained on&#xD;
his friend.&#xD;
The scene represented a mountain-gap, and&#xD;
the background of the picture was entirely&#xD;
occupied by scenery of the boldest yet most&#xD;
luxuriant character. There was no rugged-&#xD;
ness in the grand outline of the towering&#xD;
hills, for they were clothed in a royal dra-&#xD;
pery of almost tropical verdure, while on one&#xD;
side a sunny valley stretched away, bounded&#xD;
by walls 9f living green, and flecked by a hun-&#xD;
dred vicissitudes of light and shadow. This&#xD;
part of the picture was inexpressibly charm-&#xD;
ing, and was painted with 'a fidelity, a reality&#xD;
of treatment and strict attention to' detail,&#xD;
which made it almost impossible to' believe&#xD;
that it was not a faithful copy of Nature. The&#xD;
foreground of the piece was brightened by a&#xD;
small river that dashed into sight round the&#xD;
base of a lordly mountain, and, widening out&#xD;
in the sunshine, lay smooth and clear as crys-&#xD;
tal just where the bluffs that overlooked it&#xD;
made a break, and a narrow roa4 led down&#xD;
between overhanging hills t~ the water's edge.&#xD;
And here it was that the interest of the pict-&#xD;
ure centred-for here lay a small skiff which&#xD;
contained two figures in very dramatic pese.&#xD;
One was a woman, a girl whose hat had fallen&#xD;
off into the water, and was slowly floating down-&#xD;
stream, while ~he herself, with every mark of&#xD;
a recent struggle in her disordered dress, her&#xD;
loosened hair and flushed, resolute face, was&#xD;
springing forward, as if to gain the land. The&#xD;
other was a man who stood erect, and held.&#xD;
her back with one arm, while with the other&#xD;
he was loosening the boat from its fastenings,&#xD;
preparatory to pushing it out into the stream.&#xD;
The action was very well managed, for there&#xD;
was nothing strained or stiff, nothing over-&#xD;
wrought or weak about either attitude, and&#xD;
the faces of both the man and the woman&#xD;
were so strongly marked, so thoroughly mdi.&#xD;
vidiialized, that, if they had been portraits,&#xD;
they would have been recoguisable at a glance.&#xD;
The girl was singularly beautiful, and as her&#xD;
face was upturned, and the heavy masses of&#xD;
golden-brown hair fell back from it, and rolled,&#xD;
like a tide of bronze, down her back, it was&#xD;
easy to trace every line of the delicate feat-&#xD;
ures, the clear, haughty nose, the exquisite&#xD;
mouth, the finely-arched brows, the deep,&#xD;

THE PAINT&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
* large, dark eyes, full of indigiiant scorn and&#xD;
passionate resentment, the complexion white&#xD;
and pure as the petal of a water-lily. Her&#xD;
dress was very plain; but a glance was enough&#xD;
to show that she was a lady. Quite as cvi.&#xD;
dently, her companion w~s a gentleman. He&#xD;
was tall and well made, and a studied rough-&#xD;
ness of costume only brought out more plainly&#xD;
the aristocratic air stamped upon his whole&#xD;
personal appearance. His face was half-turned&#xD;
aside, showing the profile, which was very&#xD;
handsome and full of determined resolution-&#xD;
resolution different from that of the girl, in-&#xD;
asmuch as hers was evidently hot as fire,&#xD;
while his was cold as steel. The mouth was&#xD;
compressed, the nostrils were drawn, and in&#xD;
the eye there was a look of such exultant tri-&#xD;
umph, that involuntarily Travers exclaimed:&#xD;
"There's one thing I don't understand,&#xD;
Vance. How did you have the patience to&#xD;
paint that scoundrel without pitching him out&#xD;
of the boat?"&#xD;
"It was hard," said Vance, laughing~&#xD;
"but then I had no option in the matter. You&#xD;
won't believe it, Frank, but there has been a&#xD;
strange sort of power at work to make me&#xD;
paint this thing. I don't deny4hat it has a&#xD;
fascination for me, but it has a strong repul-&#xD;
sion also, especially this scoundrel, as you call,&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"The girl is a splendid creature, though,&#xD;
and she is making a gallant fight of it. What&#xD;
is to become of her, Vance?"&#xD;
"How should I know, Franzerl?"&#xD;
"Paint a rescuer, at least. Don't let that&#xD;
villain have it all his own way. By Jove I he&#xD;
looks so triumphant, that it is more than one&#xD;
can stand!"&#xD;
"Whom should I paint, and where should&#xD;
I paint him? There was no rescuer in the&#xD;
dream.&#xD;
"Paint him there," said Travers, pointing&#xD;
to a shelving bluff crowned with luxuriant fo-&#xD;
liage that overhung the river just beyond the&#xD;
boat. "As for who he should be-you are&#xD;
welcome to put me in. I'd like amazingly to&#xD;
have even an imaginary chance at punching&#xD;
that rascal's head! Or, as you are the better&#xD;
looking of the two-besides being the stronger&#xD;
-put yourself in, Vance."&#xD;
Vance flushed a little. He certainly looked&#xD;
no unfit ~ubje~t f~r a picture, as he stood&#xD;
there in all the strength and stateliness of&#xD;
early manhood, his well-knit figure uniting&#xD;
muscular power and grace of proportion in&#xD;
&#xD;
ER'S DREAM~                         105&#xD;
such rare degree, that it might have served as&#xD;
a model for an athlete. and his frank, hand-&#xD;
some face full of the pleasant light that had&#xD;
never failed to prepossess liking in any one&#xD;
who looked upon it. Just now the blue eyes&#xD;
were gazing intently at the picture so strange-&#xD;
ly suggested, so faithfully worked out, and the&#xD;
lips were smiling under the long, fair mustache&#xD;
that fell over them and matched the crest of&#xD;
crisp curls above the brow. He shook his&#xD;
head at last.&#xD;
"No, , Franzerl. You know what we&#xD;
used to say at Dusseldorf-' always be faithful&#xD;
to your inspiration.' I have never seen my.&#xD;
self in this picture."&#xD;
"Nor anybody else?"&#xD;
"Nor anybody else."&#xD;
"Well, it is deucedly hard on the poor&#xD;
girl, that is all I have to say," returned Tray-&#xD;
ers, in a most sincere tone of commiseration.&#xD;
"I wish the thing was in the fire; for it has&#xD;
bewitched you. Come, Va~ice! let us leave&#xD;
work for a while, and try a tour of rustication.&#xD;
I am sure we both need fresh subjects; I am&#xD;
sick of my everlasting genre, and I am sure&#xD;
yeu must be sick of this. By-the.byhow often&#xD;
do you dream your interesting dream? Every&#xD;
night?"&#xD;
"No. Only when I stop painting it."&#xD;
"And is it always the same? Do you&#xD;
never see the dream at a little earlier or a&#xD;
little later stage?"&#xD;
"I have never seen a thing beyond what I&#xD;
have put down here."&#xD;
"And how do you feel in regard to it?"&#xD;
Vance laughed a little. "I am-not 5magi.&#xD;
native, or easily impressed," he said. "Fri.&#xD;
manly, I feel that it is confoundedly queer;&#xD;
and secondly, I feel that I should like to get&#xD;
my hands on that fellow!"&#xD;
"I can comprehend that sensation. But&#xD;
you have not answered my question. Shall&#xD;
we go somewhere?"&#xD;
"My dear Frank, 'somewhere' is delight.&#xD;
fully indefinite. I thought, moreover, that we&#xD;
had decided that our pecuniary resources are&#xD;
too limited for us to go anywhere?"&#xD;
"Anywhere where money is a necessity,&#xD;
of course. But I know a land of milk and&#xD;
honey-don't open your eyes wider than you&#xD;
can help-where money is next to~ unknown,&#xD;
and quite unnecessary."&#xD;
"One of the dominions of Prester John,&#xD;
no doubt."&#xD;

make our fortunes-and that's a considera-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"It sounds tempting," said Vance, balan-&#xD;
cing his palette on his thumb. "But my pict-&#xD;
ure-"&#xD;
"Hang your picture! It is exactly that&#xD;
confounded thing I am anxious to take you&#xD;
away from. If we stay here, and you work&#xD;
at it much longer, I shall be reduced to the&#xD;
necessity of calling in a procession of priests&#xD;
to exorcise you with 'bell, book, and candle.'&#xD;
Come, I am in earnest-will you go?"&#xD;
Vance looked irresolutely at the painting.&#xD;
It cost a severe struggle to resolve to leave it&#xD;
behind; but he knew that, if he did not go,&#xD;
Travers himself would never consent to leave&#xD;
the city, and the hot, breathless, dog-days&#xD;
weic upon them. So, after a while, he made&#xD;
up his mind to the sacrifice with a sigh.&#xD;
"If it must be, it must," he said. "Yes,&#xD;
I'll go, Franseri. But I doubt if I shall see&#xD;
any thing half so lovely as this in all our&#xD;
travels."&#xD;
He pointed, as he spoke, to the girl in the&#xD;
foreground of his picture-at which Franzerl&#xD;
shrugged his shoulders and turned away.'&#xD;
"'The spell is in the witch's face,"' he&#xD;
said, with a laugh. "I don't think there's a&#xD;
&#xD;
doubt, Vance, that it is; and that it has&#xD;
bound you, hand and foot."&#xD;
II-&#xD;
"THEnE is no good in arguing the mat-&#xD;
ter," said Mr. Rivers, regarding his wife with&#xD;
a frowning brow; "Marion shall never marry&#xD;
that man."&#xD;
Now, if there was one thing more than an-&#xD;
other which his family and friends had always&#xD;
knqwn of John Rivers, it was that his deci-&#xD;
sions were final, and that, if he once said of&#xD;
any thing it "shall" or it ~" shall not~' be, the&#xD;
matter, might be regarded (either, negatively&#xD;
or affirmatively) as settled. He had never in&#xD;
any instance been known to change his mind;&#xD;
so when he looked at his wife now, and said,&#xD;
in the tone of a Persian satrap, "Marion shall&#xD;
never marry that man," Mrs. Rivers felt that&#xD;
all argument was useless, and, sinking back&#xD;
in her chair, uttered nothing save a faint, re-&#xD;
proachful sigh.&#xD;
"I can't imagine what ever put such an&#xD;
idea into Marion's head, or how you could&#xD;
ever have thought that I would consent to&#xD;
it!" her husband went on, in that tone of in-&#xD;
tense irritation which shows when the ther-&#xD;
mometer of masculine anger is fast approach-&#xD;
ing fever-heat. "It really seems as if I never&#xD;
go away from home that the household does&#xD;
not manage to get into some mischief. The&#xD;
last time, it was Jack's scrape; and now you&#xD;
coolly tell me that Marion wants to marry the&#xD;
most unprincipled scamp in the country."&#xD;
"My dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Rivers, in a&#xD;
tone of expostulation.&#xD;
"Yes," said her husband, unflinchingly.&#xD;
"I mean exactly what I say: I never knew a&#xD;
Rayford who was not an unprincipled scamp;&#xD;
and, from all that I hear of this young man,&#xD;
he bids fair to increase the family reputation.&#xD;
Of course they don't lie, or steal, or do any&#xD;
thing of that sort; but they are a set of gam-&#xD;
bling, duelling desperadoes, and I would see&#xD;
Marion in her grave before she should marry&#xD;
one of them."&#xD;
"But, John, is it fair to judge in this&#xD;
way?" cried Mrs. Rivers, with an attempt at&#xD;
appeal. "This young man came back from&#xD;
Europe only the other day; and; indcedhe&#xD;
seems very different from the rest of the fain-&#xD;
* ily. Of course, I know what the Rayfoards&#xD;
are-but he seems very different.".&#xD;
"He might seem like an angel of light,&#xD;
and I should not trust him," said Mr. Rivers,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PIN'J&#xD;
&#xD;
dryly. "Besides, I tell you that I have heard&#xD;
of him. I never mentioned it before, for I did&#xD;
not suppose the matter would ever concern&#xD;
us, and I am not given to spreading gossip;&#xD;
but Harry Armstrong was in Germany at the&#xD;
same time that this-what is his name ?-this&#xD;
Alston Rayford was, and he told me of more&#xD;
than one scandal in which his name was&#xD;
prominent. You might like such a husband&#xD;
for Marion, but I should not."&#xD;
Mrs. Rivers sighed deeply and helplessly.&#xD;
She knew that, to combat her husband's reso-&#xD;
lution, was to dash herself against a rock;&#xD;
and yet she sighed-partly for her daughter's&#xD;
disappointment, partly for her own. Her heart&#xD;
had been very much set on possessing Mr.&#xD;
Alston Rayford, with his handsome presence&#xD;
and charming manners, as a son-in-law; and&#xD;
she could not resign the prospect without&#xD;
regret. She looked at her husband, but hi~&#xD;
firmly-set mouth and determined face were not&#xD;
encouraging; so, after' pausing a considerable&#xD;
time, she found nothing better to reply than-&#xD;
"I am sure I don't know what Marion&#xD;
will say!"&#xD;
"That is not a matter of much impor-&#xD;
tance," answered Marion's father. "As for&#xD;
what she will do-she will abide by my de-&#xD;
cision, and receive no more of Mr. Rayford's&#xD;
visits or attentions."&#xD;
"You forget that he has made an offer,&#xD;
John. She' will have to see him, or else write&#xD;
to him and tell him of your-your decision."&#xD;
"She will have to do neither the one nor&#xD;
the other. I will see him and settle the mat-,&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
"But, John, don't you think&#xD;
"I think that you are as absurdly infatu-&#xD;
ated as Marion herself," interrupted Mr. Rivers,&#xD;
impatiently. "1 told you, a moment ago, that&#xD;
it is useless to argue the matter. My mind is&#xD;
made up; and I am the head of my own&#xD;
household, I hope. You can tell Marion what&#xD;
I say, or you can send her to me, whichever&#xD;
you please."&#xD;
"I think I had better tell her," said Mrs.&#xD;
Rivers, meekly.&#xD;
"Do so, then," said her husband, shortly.&#xD;
"No doubt she will think that I am a hard-&#xD;
hearted tyrant, 'and that she' is an injured&#xD;
victim, but take care that she don't think&#xD;
that there is any hope of her being ultimately&#xD;
allowed to marry thd man."&#xD;
Mrs. Rivers made no reply; but, from the&#xD;
mere habit of obedience, rose and left the&#xD;
&#xD;
1~ER'S DREAM.                        107&#xD;
room. Once in the hall, with the door closed&#xD;
between her husband and herself; she stopped&#xD;
and wrung her hands. She was a delicate,&#xD;
helpless-looking woman at all times, but the&#xD;
helplessness of her aspect came out with pe-&#xD;
culiar and almost ludicrous force just now, as&#xD;
she stood at the foot of the staircase, gazing&#xD;
absently out of the broad open doors at the&#xD;
summer landscape beyond, and dreading the&#xD;
meeting with her daughter even more than&#xD;
she had lately dreaded the meeting with her&#xD;
husband. But there was no alternative of&#xD;
evasion. Marion must be informed of her&#xD;
father's resolution without delay. "Every&#xD;
thing falls on me," said Mrs. Rivers to herself,&#xD;
in an injured tone-.--aud, then she began to&#xD;
mount the stairs. Before she reached the&#xD;
second floor, gay voices floated down to her&#xD;
ear; and, when she paused on the landing, a&#xD;
door just in front of her was half-open, giving&#xD;
a pleasant glimpse of a chamber airy with&#xD;
light summer drapery, fragrant with the per-&#xD;
fume of roses and honeysuckle clambering&#xD;
round the windows, and full of a ripple of&#xD;
girlish talk and laughter proceeding from two&#xD;
unmen mouths. Mrs. Rivers knew at once&#xD;
that Marion's most intimate friend, Miss Nellie&#xD;
Forrest, was with her. But this young lady&#xD;
was so entirely one of the family, that no&#xD;
household secrets were kept from her, and h~r&#xD;
presence did not afford an excuse for procras-&#xD;
tination. So Mrs. Rivers advanced at once to&#xD;
the open door, and, as the two girls looked up,&#xD;
her face told her story before she had time to&#xD;
open her lips.&#xD;
"Mamma!"&#xD;
"Mrs. Rivers!"&#xD;
It was an alternate exclamation; and then&#xD;
the first speaker hurried on:&#xD;
"Mamma, something is the matter. What&#xD;
is it?"&#xD;
"A. great deal is the matter, Marion,'9 an-&#xD;
swered Mrs. Rivers, despondently.&#xD;
"Has papa come back?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"And have you told him about Aiston?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"And what does he say?"&#xD;
"He says he would see you in your grave&#xD;
sooner than to let you marry him." ~&#xD;
"Mammal"&#xD;
"He absolutely refuses his consent," said&#xD;
Mrs. Rivers, sitting'down in the chair nearest&#xD;
to her, and looking at her daughter with an&#xD;
air of appeal.&#xD;

108                        THE I~AINT1I&#xD;
"It is not my fault, Marion. I said all I&#xD;
could-but you know your father. It would&#xD;
have done no good if I had gone on my knees&#xD;
to him. lIe says you shall not marry Mr.&#xD;
Rayford."&#xD;
"He has no right to say 50 1" cried Marion,&#xD;
and she rose to her feet as she spoke, her face&#xD;
flushing and her form quivering. "You need&#xD;
not look at me, mamma! If he was my fa-&#xD;
ther a hundred times over, he would have no&#xD;
right to say so without some reason for it.&#xD;
And he has no reason. Everybody knows&#xD;
that there is not a thing to be said against&#xD;
Alston."&#xD;
"His family, Marion-"&#xD;
"His family are not himself-even if you&#xD;
believe, all that has been said about them.&#xD;
And, for my part, I don't believe half of it"&#xD;
"But your father says ho has heard some&#xD;
unfavorable reports about Mr. Rayford him-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"He might hear slanders and falsehoods&#xD;
about anybody," Marion answered. "I see&#xD;
he has brought you over to his opinion,&#xD;
mamma-of cou~so that was to be expected.&#xD;
Only don~~ t~nk~ that I am going to submit&#xD;
like this. If papa has any charge to make&#xD;
against Aiston, he ought to make it explicitly,&#xD;
and give him an opportunity to refute it. But&#xD;
to stab a man's character in the dark-.-if it&#xD;
was any one else, I would not hesitate to say&#xD;
that it looks very much like slandering!"&#xD;
"Marion!" Mrs. Rivers stood a good&#xD;
deal in awe of her beautiful and spoiled daugh-&#xD;
ter; but really this was too much even for her&#xD;
patience. "Marion, you forget yourself!&#xD;
Your father never said a thing that was un-&#xD;
true in his life; and with reason, or without&#xD;
reason, he has a right to decide whom you&#xD;
shall marry."&#xD;
"He has not!" said Marion; and as she&#xD;
stood there, with her face growing momently&#xD;
whiter, and her eyes momently darker, it was&#xD;
easy to see that she had inherited much of her&#xD;
father's obstinacy. "Nobody has such a right&#xD;
without some reason for its exercise. It would&#xD;
be tyranny. But I will see Alston, and-"&#xD;
"You are not to see him any more," in-&#xD;
terposed Mrs. Rivers, hastily.&#xD;
,~' Mammal What do you mean?"&#xD;
"It is very plain what I mean, Marion.&#xD;
Your father says you are not to receive any&#xD;
mere of Mr Rayford's visits or attentions;&#xD;
and that he himself will tell him that you can-&#xD;
not marry him." -&#xD;
&#xD;
R'S DREAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
Marion looked at her mother and gave a&#xD;
gasp. Such an arbitrary dictum seemed to&#xD;
her so outrageous, that it was almost incred-&#xD;
ible. But a moment's reflection showed her&#xD;
the folly of wasting expo~tuIation or indigna-&#xD;
tion on Mrs. Rivers, who was the mere mouth-&#xD;
piece of her father's resolution. So, without&#xD;
a word, she turned to leave the room.&#xD;
"Marion 1" cried her mother, hastily,&#xD;
"where are you going?"&#xD;
"I am going to papa," Marion answered.&#xD;
"I must speak to him. Don't try to detain&#xD;
me, mamma. I must-I wrn go I"&#xD;
Her mother caught her, but she drew&#xD;
away, and, before she could be stopped again,&#xD;
ran quickly down-stairs. Listening in mute&#xD;
consternation, Mrs. Rivers heard her cross the&#xD;
hail, knock at her fathei~'s door, enter and&#xD;
close it behind her. Then she looked up at&#xD;
Mita Forrest, who laughed and shrugged her&#xD;
shoulders.&#xD;
"It is a case of Greek meeting Greek,"&#xD;
the latter said. "I think we may reasonably&#xD;
expect there will be a tug of war."&#xD;
"I am sure that Marion will be worsted,&#xD;
then," said Mrs. Rivers ~ "and, whatever hap-&#xD;
pens, they are both of them sure to blame&#xD;
me."&#xD;
Half an hour passed. At the end of that&#xD;
time the door below opened, and Mr. Rivers's&#xD;
voice was heard calling his wife's name. When&#xD;
she came, he pointed to his daughter, who&#xD;
stood in the middle of the floor, flushed, and&#xD;
defiant-looking.&#xD;
"There is a young lady who has adopted a&#xD;
belief in the right of her sex to choose hus-&#xD;
bands as well as to rule them," he said, sar-&#xD;
castically. "She refuses to obey my com-&#xD;
mand with regard to Mr. Rayford, and an-&#xD;
nounces her intention of 'keeping faith' with&#xD;
him. Whether that romantic phrase means&#xD;
an elopement or not, I don't know-nor ~o I&#xD;
care. I have told her that she shall never&#xD;
marry him with my consent, or in my house.&#xD;
If she chooses to disgrace herself by eloping&#xD;
with him, that is her own affair. I have no&#xD;
intention of locking her up."&#xD;
"And I have no intention of eloping," said&#xD;
Marion. "You know me well enough, sir, to&#xD;
know that. If I must submit to your com-&#xD;
mands in this matter, I shall do so. But I&#xD;
only submit-I do not yield. That is, I still&#xD;
hold myself engaged to Aiston, unless he&#xD;
chooses to break the engagement."&#xD;
"Even when I forbid it?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PAI&#xD;
&#xD;
"Even when you forbid it, if you give m&#xD;
no reason for doing so."&#xD;
"That is to say, there is to be a series ol&#xD;
clandestine meetings going on all the time?"&#xD;
"No. I hope I shall never forget myself&#xD;
far enough to do any thing of that kind. But&#xD;
if I meet Alston at the houses of our friends&#xD;
I shall treat him as heretofore."&#xD;
"Then I shall send you where no such in&#xD;
testing meetings can occur. Lucy "-thiz&#xD;
to Mrs. Rivers-" will you see that her trunh&#xD;
is packed? I promised George when he was&#xD;
here last that she should go to see him some&#xD;
summer. This summer will do as well as&#xD;
any."&#xD;
"But the White Sulphur, John!" cried&#xD;
Mrs. Rivers, all aghast&#xD;
"The White Sulphur la ZZQt a fit place ikw&#xD;
young ladies who refuse to obey their fa-&#xD;
thers," answered Mr. Rivers, coolly. "You&#xD;
can go there if you choose, and take the&#xD;
younger girls; but Marion shall go to&#xD;
George's."&#xD;
"0 Marion! my dear child, why don't you&#xD;
yield to your father?" cried Mrs. Rivers, with&#xD;
an appeal which her daughter's face might&#xD;
have showed her was vain. "You will die up&#xD;
there, in those dreadful backwoods-I know&#xD;
you will."&#xD;
"That is papa's affair," said Marion, in a&#xD;
hard voice. "If he chooses to send me into&#xD;
exile and virtual prison because I won't give&#xD;
up an honest gentleman who loves me well&#xD;
enough to merit some constancy from me,&#xD;
why, I cannot help it. The threat of being&#xD;
sent to Uncle George's is not going to make&#xD;
me do a thing I would not do without it."&#xD;
"I did not expect to make you do any&#xD;
thing," said her father. "And it is not a&#xD;
threat, either-it is a certainty. I want you&#xD;
to be ready next week, and I will take you to&#xD;
the mountains myself."&#xD;
He left the room as he spoke, and imme-&#xD;
diately afterward Marion broke away from&#xD;
her mother and ran up-stairs. The reason of&#xD;
this was apparent when she reached her own&#xD;
chamber. She was in a perfect passion of&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
After a while the violence of the storm&#xD;
abated, and then the tale of her discomfiture&#xD;
was duly told to the sympathizing ear of Miss&#xD;
Forrest. It is impossible to do justice to the&#xD;
disgust of this young~ lady when she heard&#xD;
that, instead of the White Sulphur (for which&#xD;
they had been laying gay plans, and making&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
TER'S DREAM.                         109&#xD;
e gay preparations that very morning), her&#xD;
friend was sentenced to banishment at "Un.&#xD;
cle George's." Like most Eastern Carolin-&#xD;
ians, she had a profound ignorance and deep&#xD;
horror of the western part-the "up-coun-&#xD;
try" in Carolina parlance-of her own State;&#xD;
and she would really have felt less commisera-&#xD;
tion for Marion if that young lady had an-&#xD;
nounced that she was sentenced to an ex-&#xD;
tended rustication in the interior of Oregon.&#xD;
The warmth of her friendship, and the depth&#xD;
of her self-sacrificing spirit, may therefore be&#xD;
imagined when at last she said;&#xD;
"Well, if it is absolutely settled-if you&#xD;
are really to go, there is one thing certain,&#xD;
Marion, you can't go alone. As your mother&#xD;
says, you would really die up there. If you&#xD;
are not to be at tize White Sulphur, it has lost&#xD;
all attraction for me; so, if you think I would&#xD;
be welcome, I will go into banishment with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Nellie I" Marion looked up, and actually&#xD;
smiled through her tears. "You are not-&#xD;
you cannot be in earnest?"&#xD;
"I am, though, if you will take me."&#xD;
"But it would be too abominably selfish&#xD;
to let you do such a thing."&#xD;
"Really I should think itwas my concern&#xD;
if I choose to immolate myself on the altar of&#xD;
friendship. Besides, it is only changing the&#xD;
programme, and substituting our own moun-&#xD;
tains for those of Virginia."&#xD;
"And Uncle George's for the White Sul-&#xD;
phur I No, no, Nellie; indeed, it must not be.&#xD;
There is no help for me. Cnsar has spoken,&#xD;
and I must obey. But you are different. You&#xD;
must go to the White Sulphur, do my flirting&#xD;
and dancing as well as your own, console poor&#xD;
Aiston, write me long accounts of every thing,&#xD;
and-"&#xD;
"And be wretched all the time, thinking&#xD;
of you. No, no, my dear. Spare yourself&#xD;
any further recapitulation of White Sulphur&#xD;
delights. I am bound westward. I mean to&#xD;
bear you company to Uncle George's. Mr.&#xD;
Rivers won't look upon mc as a spy of the&#xD;
enemy, and refuse to take me, I suppose?"&#xD;
"No-I can't imagine why he should."&#xD;
"Then regard the matter as settled. And&#xD;
now let us see what dresses we shall take into&#xD;
banishment."&#xD;

THE PAINTER'S DREAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
North Carolina, .the two young ladies soon&#xD;
found themselves safely domiciled in the house&#xD;
of Mr. George Rivers, and thrown upon their&#xD;
own resources for amusement and entertain-&#xD;
ment. As far as material comfort went, they&#xD;
found nothing of which to complain ; for, al-&#xD;
though the whim of pitching his tent in the&#xD;
wilderness had seized .Mr. Rivers, he had not&#xD;
thought it necessary to leave all the luxuries&#xD;
of civilization behind, and as many as were&#xD;
compatible with a mountain plantation, and a&#xD;
house built of substantial logs, had accom-&#xD;
panied him. His wife, too, was one of the&#xD;
women who carry an air of refinement wher-&#xD;
ever they go; and the hardy little mountain-&#xD;
eers who were his children, though free and&#xD;
frolicsome as little kids, were still full of the&#xD;
.instinctive courtesy and winning grace of born&#xD;
gentlefolks. On the whole, it was a very smil-&#xD;
ing and happy home to which the exiles were&#xD;
welcomed ; and even Marion thought she had&#xD;
never seen a prettier picture than this log-&#xD;
house, with its many wings and piazzas, its&#xD;
shade-trees and embowering creepers. Around&#xD;
in every direction stretched the grand moun-&#xD;
tain-ranges, clad in their garments of primeval&#xD;
forests, and before the door of the house swept&#xD;
a limpid mountain-river, sparkling and foam-&#xD;
ing as it dashed along on its way to join the&#xD;
French Broad not far below. It is creditable&#xD;
to the two girls to say that for a time they&#xD;
were so much enchanted by the exuberant&#xD;
beauty and overflowing vitality of this fair&#xD;
region, and so ready to echo Mr. Rivers's en-&#xD;
thusiastic praise of its pure air and life-restor.-&#xD;
ing powers, that they almost forgot the gay&#xD;
social circle they had left behind, the friends,&#xD;
and even the admirers who were mourning&#xD;
their absence. Whether one of them entirely&#xD;
forgot the lover who was the cause of her&#xD;
banishment, is a matter open to doubt ; but&#xD;
at least she didl not regret him very effusively,&#xD;
and threw herself with very sincere zest into&#xD;
the simple pleasures of their daily life. Mrs.&#xD;
Rivers, who had feared that she would find a&#xD;
moping, lovesick damsel on her hands, was&#xD;
delighted beyond measure with this bright&#xD;
creature, who took an interest in the cows and&#xD;
calves almost equal to her own ; who went on&#xD;
long rambles with the children, coming back&#xD;
laden down with sweet wild flowers, and lus-&#xD;
~cious wild fruits, and who never seemed. to&#xD;
think it necessary to revenge herself on her&#xD;
entertainers for the chance which had thrown&#xD;
her into their care. -&#xD;
&#xD;
Still Maridhi and her friend were mortal&#xD;
young ladies, with all the tastes and desires&#xD;
of their age and class. The view from their&#xD;
new home was very magnificent ; but some-&#xD;
times they could not help feeling that it would&#xD;
be improved if there was even a glimpse to be&#xD;
obtained of another roof, or the smoke of an-&#xD;
other chimney--if their nearest neighbor had&#xD;
been at all companionable, or had lived with&#xD;
something lesssthan ten miles of mountain-&#xD;
country between them. As it was, they were&#xD;
entirely isolated, and, after they had exhaust-&#xD;
ed all th'e books and played all the music,&#xD;
they began to find that tine hung a little heavy&#xD;
on their hands. -    'hd&#xD;
" Nellie," said Marion, after she ha&#xD;
yawned five times consecutively one afternoon,&#xD;
"let us call the children and go to walk. I&#xD;
am tired to death of doing nothing, and even&#xD;
scrambling over the rocks will be an occupa-&#xD;
tion."                 -       ,     ,&#xD;
"I am sure I am willing," said Nellhe,&#xD;
lazily. " Only there's a very dark cloud&#xD;
coming up from the south, and I confess I&#xD;
should not like to be caught in one of these&#xD;
mountain-rains. They would sweep us liter-&#xD;
ally away."&#xD;
" I wonder if anybody would mind that ?"&#xD;
said Marion, meditatively. "I wonder if Al-&#xD;
ston would think I had drowned myself in&#xD;
sheer despair, and if he .would commit suicide&#xD;
in consequence ? Dear me, Nell, it has been&#xD;
more than a month since we came here ! Who&#xD;
would believe it ?"&#xD;
"I, for one," replied Nell, .with a shrug-.&#xD;
" Without meaning any disrespect to any-&#xD;
body, I have been in more lively places-.&#xD;
Suppose we do go out and get swept away,&#xD;
Marion ? It would make a sensation at home,&#xD;
and win at least a nine-days' fame for us."&#xD;
"Iam not sure of even the nine-days' fame ~&#xD;
said Marion, laughing, and walking to the win-&#xD;
dow. " Look !-see how that cloud is sweep-&#xD;
ing up. In five minutes the storm will be on&#xD;
us."&#xD;
In less than five minutes, Mrs. Rivers came&#xD;
hurrying in, and advised that the windows&#xD;
should be closed. "It is no ordinary storm&#xD;
that is coming," she added. " That cloud,&#xD;
and this sudden, dead calm mean mischief-.&#xD;
Don't stand in the open draught that way,&#xD;
Marion!i You have no idea how dangerous&#xD;
it is !"              ,     ,&#xD;
" I am not afraid," said Marion, and she&#xD;
Kept her position, watching with interest the&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PAINTER'S DREAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
111&#xD;
&#xD;
premonitions of coming storm that seemed to&#xD;
seize all Nature. The black, livid cloud,&#xD;
which a few minutes before had been a mere&#xD;
speck on the horizon, now entirely obscured&#xD;
the sunlight, and was spreading rapidly over&#xD;
the sky, overcasting the bright day with grim&#xD;
determination. But as yet all was silent. The&#xD;
trees were hushed as 'if spellbound, andl the&#xD;
only sound on the air was that of the birds&#xD;
-which were flying about and seeking refuge&#xD;
under the caves of the house, with low, dis-&#xD;
tressed cries. The air was heavy and close,&#xD;
and, involuntarily, Marion gasped for breath.&#xD;
" What a dead hush there is ! " she said ; and,&#xD;
as she said it, her eyes chanced to fall on two&#xD;
strangers who had crossed the stream in front&#xD;
of the house, and were advancing up the lawn&#xD;
with the evident intention of seeking shelter.&#xD;
They were men, young, stalwart, and dressed&#xD;
in travelling-suits of nondescript material, and&#xD;
yet more nondescript color. But, although the&#xD;
knapsacks which they carried proved that they&#xD;
were foot-travellers,a single glance showed Mar-&#xD;
ion that theybelonged to agrade ofsociety rare-&#xD;
ly represented in that rough region. She turned&#xD;
round to call Mrs. Riders' attention to them ;&#xD;
but, as she did so, there came a vivid flash of&#xD;
dazzling, blinding light, a clap of thunder that&#xD;
shook the house until it quivered, a crash that&#xD;
sounded as if the solid mountains had been&#xD;
rent asunder, and a hurricane of wind that tore&#xD;
through the chamber, filling it with din and up-&#xD;
roar, and throwing her prostrate on the floor.&#xD;
The next thing she heard, even above the&#xD;
tumult of the now raging storm, was a scream&#xD;
from Mrs. Rivers.&#xD;
" Look !" she cried, " the large oak has&#xD;
been struck by lightning !"&#xD;
Marion sprung to her feet, Nellie rushed&#xD;
forward, and, regardless of danger, they all&#xD;
three clustered and clung around the window. I&#xD;
They saw then the meaning of the crash which&#xD;
had sounded so fearfully in their ears a mo-&#xD;
ment before. A gigantic oak just in front ofi&#xD;
the house had attracted the electric fluid, and&#xD;
its mighty trunk had been literally cleft asun-&#xD;
der-one half still standing, but the other por- t&#xD;
tion lying across the lawn, and including in its f&#xD;
downfall two or three of the smaller trees, and t&#xD;
part of the piazza-roof. A tempest of wind  g&#xD;
and rain was sweeping by, but still they were ii&#xD;
able to perceive that a~ man-only one-was b&#xD;
fighting his way to the house, and that Mr.-Io&#xD;
Rivers, with two or three servants, was hurry. Ih&#xD;
ing out to meet him. When they met, the s&#xD;
&#xD;
~py&#xD;
&#xD;
stranger said a few wrsiaectd      man&#xD;

the boughs of the fallen ok la widytosn&#xD;
about.genaaywdytosg&#xD;
" There were two of them," said Main&#xD;
with a shudder. " One has been struck.aron&#xD;
As she spoke,,she saw two of the servants&#xD;
unite their strength in lifting aside one heavy&#xD;
limb of the tree, while Mr. Rivers and the&#xD;
stranger drewv an apparently senseless figue&#xD;
from beneath it, and then, in the midst ofgure&#xD;
whirling, driving storm, they bore it to the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
The ladies ran down-stairs, and met them&#xD;
in the lower ball. The injured man had bee&#xD;
laid down, and a throng of children and ser-&#xD;
vants were about him when they advanced.&#xD;
On one side knelt Mr. Rivers, endeavoring to&#xD;
discover the extent of his injuries, and on the&#xD;
other his companion, feeling his pulse, and&#xD;
anxiously calling his name.&#xD;
"Vance, Vance,' he said, " my dear fellow,&#xD;
are you much hurt?"&#xD;
Marion and Nellie, who had paused in the&#xD;
background, exchanged glances of commisera-&#xD;
tion. "Poor fellow," whispered the former,&#xD;
"look how young and handsome he is ! He&#xD;
may be only stunned by the fall of the tree,&#xD;
not by the lightning. I wonder if they have&#xD;
tried restoratives.--Aunit Sophie-"&#xD;
She turned eagerly toward Mrs. Rivers,&#xD;
but Mrs. Rivers had left her side, and was at&#xD;
that moment bending over the stranger. "Salts&#xD;
of ammonia might restore him," she went on,&#xD;
quickly. " I'll go for some.-Wouldn't you,&#xD;
Nell ?"&#xD;
Before Nell could answer, she was gone,.&#xD;
speeding away like a deer, and returning in a&#xD;
momerit with a small vinaigrette. Travers-&#xD;
bending over his friend in an agony of fear&#xD;
and anxiety, was not aware that any one was&#xD;
near him, until a soft hand put something&#xD;
ato his own, and a soft voice said :&#xD;
" Try that. It may restore him."&#xD;
Mechanically he looked down, and,,seeing&#xD;
hat it was a smelling-bottle, held it tb: his&#xD;
riend's nostrils. The salts were strongpand&#xD;
he effect was instantaneous. Lorimer gave a&#xD;
;asp, and his lids lifted-the eyes opening,..as&#xD;
chanced, full on Marion's face. Every mem-&#xD;
er of the group saw his violent stark; but&#xD;
nly Travers understood him when he-raised&#xD;
is head, crying, " The picture i-"' and' then&#xD;
ank back fainting.&#xD;

There was a great commotion. In a meas-&#xD;
ure, they were reassured by perceiving that&#xD;
he had not been shocked by electricity; but&#xD;
they soon discovered that one shoulder had&#xD;
been dislocated by the fall of the tree. So he&#xD;
was carried to a chamber, and such remedies&#xD;
applied by Mr. Rivers (who was a very good&#xD;
doctor in an amateur way) as would best in-&#xD;
sure repose.&#xD;
"The poor fellow jerked his shoulder-was&#xD;
the reason he fainted," he said. "We must&#xD;
put it in place, and then every thing must be&#xD;
kept quiet."&#xD;
Putting the shoulder in place was, after&#xD;
some difficulty, accomplished; but keeping&#xD;
every thing quiet was another matter, since&#xD;
the whole household was in a fever of excite-&#xD;
ment over this unexpected event. Indeed,&#xD;
considering their quiet habits, they had reason&#xD;
enough for excitement. A storm, almost ,un-&#xD;
exampled for violence, was raging; the river&#xD;
was rising rapidly; the old oak was shivered;&#xD;
the piazza-roof was knocked off; one of the&#xD;
horses had been killed by lightning; and two&#xD;
strangers-one of them dying, or next thing&#xD;
to it-were in the house! In all her lifc, Mrs.&#xD;
Rivers had never had so much trouble to keep&#xD;
the children within even moderate bounds of&#xD;
good behavior. Nor was the excitement re-&#xD;
stricted to the children. Marion and Nellie&#xD;
shared it in no small degree, and laughingly&#xD;
admitted as much to each other.&#xD;
"It comes of the life we have been lead-&#xD;
ing," said Miss Forrest, philosophically. "We&#xD;
are in the condition of being 'pleased by a&#xD;
rattle, and tickled with a straw,' in the way of&#xD;
sensations. Not that I think this is either a&#xD;
rattle or a straw! Heavens what a flash that&#xD;
was! I shall never forget it."&#xD;
"I shall never forget that poer fellow's&#xD;
face, as he lay insensiblg," said Marion; "and,&#xD;
when he opened his eyes, he looked at me&#xD;
more strangely 1hai~ you can imagine. He ab-&#xD;
solutely might have thought I was a ghost!&#xD;
And, thenhis exclamation-did you hear it?"&#xD;
~' Yes. It, was a strange thing to say."&#xD;
~' And he said it, looking straight at mc, as&#xD;
if Iwas the picture he meant. When be sank&#xD;
back, I really thought for a moment he was&#xD;
dead."&#xD;
"I wonder what put a picture in his&#xD;
hQad?" said Nelly, amusingly.&#xD;
"They are artists," said Mrs. Rivers, who&#xD;
wa~ sitting in the room, not far from the two&#xD;
girls-" they are artists, out on a walking aiid&#xD;
&#xD;
HER'S DREAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
sketching tour. The one who was uninjured&#xD;
told Mr. Rivers that they were coming here to&#xD;
seek shelter when the storm overtook them."&#xD;
"Yes," said Marion; "I saw them. I had&#xD;
just turned round to tell you, when the flash&#xD;
came, and put every thing else out of my head.&#xD;
The poor fellow who is hurt was well and&#xD;
strong then. How sad it seems!"&#xD;
"It would seem much more sad if ht~ was&#xD;
dead," said the matter-of-fact Nellie. "As it&#xD;
is, I hope he is not much hurt. Mr. Rivers&#xD;
says not. - 0 Tom, I am so glad to' see&#xD;
that!~i&#xD;
She broke off in this way, as a little darkey&#xD;
came ia with his arms full of light-wood knots,&#xD;
and began piling them up in the empty fire-&#xD;
place. After he had erected his edifice, one&#xD;
stroke of a match set fire to it, and in a mo-&#xD;
ment a light, sparkling blaze was filling the&#xD;
room with ruddy cheer. The ladies gathered&#xD;
round eagerly-even in midsummer a heavy&#xD;
mountain-rain leaves the atmosphere unpleas-&#xD;
antly cold-and they were grouped together,&#xD;
laughing and talking, when Mr. Rivers, ac-&#xD;
companied by Travers, entered. Both gentle-&#xD;
men thought it a pleasant scene; but the&#xD;
young artist was especially charmed, the more&#xD;
so in consideration of his long exile from any&#xD;
thing which bore even the faintest stamp of&#xD;
such refinement as was plainly to be seen&#xD;
here. He looked at the room with its grace.&#xD;
ful furniture and pictures, its open piano and&#xD;
books, and at the ladies in their elegant dress-&#xD;
es and glossy coronas of hair. Then he turned&#xD;
to Mr. Rivers, saying, in a tone the sincerity&#xD;
of which could not be doubted:&#xD;
"If poor Lorimer were only well, how&#xD;
much he would enjoy this!"&#xD;
The ladies overheard the remark, and&#xD;
looked at each other with a smile. Every&#xD;
one liked him the better for this frank un-&#xD;
selfishness, this quick remembrance of his&#xD;
friend where many a man w~~uld only have&#xD;
thought of himself. And, when he came for-&#xD;
ward and was prcscnt~d to them, they gave&#xD;
him such a warm anil cordial welcome as Car.&#xD;
olininns like to think that only they know how&#xD;
to give. They soon found that he was a thor-&#xD;
ough-bred gentleman; and, when once the ice&#xD;
of first acquaintance was thawed, they enjoyed&#xD;
his society as much as, or more than, he did&#xD;
theirs. He was a genial companion, and it&#xD;
was a very pleasant evening which ensued. In&#xD;
the studios of DUsseldorf, his talent as a s-a-&#xD;
conteur had been fully appreciated; so it was&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PAINT&#xD;
&#xD;
no wonder that they enjoyed the history ~of&#xD;
his adventures, and the more because, by a&#xD;
few happy touches, he always took care to&#xD;
throw the chief gloi-y of his narrative on poor,&#xD;
wounded Vance. Then, at their request, he&#xD;
brought out his sketch-book; and, by the&#xD;
time its contents were sufficiently admired,&#xD;
the usual hour of retiring had long since&#xD;
passed, and it was time to say "Good-night."&#xD;
It was said, therefore, with manly compliments&#xD;
on both sides, many wishes for the injured&#xD;
gentleman's speedy recovery, and many laugh-&#xD;
ing congratulations that the storm had blown&#xD;
such a pleasant visitor within their doors.&#xD;
Marion and Nellie congratulated each other&#xD;
warmly on this fact when they were in their&#xD;
chamber, and said that a thing more charming&#xD;
could not possibly have occurred. Of course,&#xD;
iftheyhad been at home, it would have seemed&#xD;
a matter of small importance; but, out in the&#xD;
depths of the wild woods, a pedestrian artist,&#xD;
who was also a polished gentleman, was a s-era&#xD;
avTh not to be despised. Then they talked of&#xD;
his companion, and wondered if he would soon&#xD;
be well, and if he would tell them then what&#xD;
he meant by that strange exclamation. They&#xD;
could not forget about this, but went on mar-&#xD;
velling over it, and exhausting imagination in&#xD;
conjectures. It was a pity they had not been&#xD;
the possessors of Hassan's invisible cap; for,&#xD;
if they could only have entered the room of&#xD;
the strangers, and heard a conversation then&#xD;
in progress, their curiosity would have been&#xD;
gratified. Lorimer was wide awake, and, after&#xD;
Mr. Rivers had, with many directions and good I&#xD;
wishes, left the room, he addressed himself&#xD;
eagerly to his friend:&#xD;
"Well, Frafizerl, what is she like?"&#xD;
"Amazingly like the picture," Travers an-&#xD;
swered; "yet not so much like as to justify 1&#xD;
your fainting away, Vance."&#xD;
"It was the shoulder made me faint," said&#xD;
Vance. "Confound the thing-how it did&#xD;
hurt! But, Frank, I never was more aston-&#xD;
ished in my life than when I opened my eyes c&#xD;
on that face-the- very face of my dream. It c&#xD;
sent a thrill through me as if I had seen a f&#xD;
ghost."                                   r&#xD;
"You looked as if you had," said Frank, a&#xD;
(lryly.                                   a&#xD;
"Did anybody notice it? Did they ask n&#xD;
you about it?"                            a&#xD;
"They must have iioticcd it; but they are ~&#xD;
too well-bred to ask about it. I never saw v&#xD;
more cultivated people, Vance. And yet they tI&#xD;
&#xD;
ER'S DREAM.                           113&#xD;
are buried here among crackers and rattle-&#xD;
snakes. Isn't it a strange taste?"&#xD;
"They love man less and Nature more than&#xD;
most of us do," said Vance. "But that face!&#xD;
It haunts me; I cannot get over the shock the&#xD;
first sight of it gave me. Frank, do you think&#xD;
I have been brought here to meet her?"&#xD;
"To get your shoulder~ dislocated, more&#xD;
likely. Nonsense, Vance! She resembles&#xD;
your picture, but in no extraordinary degree.&#xD;
The same general east of feature, the same&#xD;
eyes and hair-that is all. Your fancy has&#xD;
done the rest."&#xD;
"My fancy has done nothing," said Vance,&#xD;
decidedly. "I tell you it is the very face of&#xD;
my dream! It has a different expression--&#xD;
that is all the change. Frank, you cannot&#xD;
imagine how strangely it has made me feel."&#xD;
"No," said Frank, shortly; "but I can im-&#xD;
agine that it will put you in a fever, if you go&#xD;
on at this rate. Deuce take the picture, and&#xD;
every thing connected with it! Do stop talk-&#xD;
ing, and go to sleep. There's an opiate here&#xD;
the old gentleman said I was to give you if&#xD;
you didn't. On my honor, Vance, you'll find,&#xD;
when you see the girl, that there is no such&#xD;
astonishing likeness. She is charming, how-&#xD;
ever, and the other one-there is another one,&#xD;
you know-even more so. You had better&#xD;
get well, and snake their acquaintance; and&#xD;
you won't get well, if you don't stop talking."&#xD;
"It is she!" said Vance.&#xD;
But he spoke softly, as if to himself, and&#xD;
ifter that he lay quite still. Perhaps Travers's&#xD;
Last remonstrance had some effect, for he said&#xD;
ao more, and before very long sunk to sleep.&#xD;
[a an hour or two he woke suddenly, with a&#xD;
~asp and a start.&#xD;
More vividly than ever before, the dream&#xD;
iad come to him.&#xD;
IV.&#xD;
TuE next morning Mr. Rivers found his&#xD;
patientt in a very feverish and unfavorable&#xD;
condition. The shoulder was worse instead&#xD;
f better, the bruises were exceedingly pain-&#xD;
ul, the pulse was racing along at a more rapi~l&#xD;
ate than promised well for physical good,&#xD;
nd, on the whole, he thought it necessary to&#xD;
isue an immediate order for close confine-&#xD;
ient and medical treatment. Vance rebelled&#xD;
little at first, but was brought to terms by&#xD;
irs. Rivers, whose~ bright face and gentle&#xD;
oice worked such a magical transformation&#xD;
ic moment she entered his room, that he&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8071-00000065"/>&#xD;
succumbed at once into her hands, and yielded&#xD;
himself captive without even a desire for res-&#xD;
cue. She was light in her rule, however, and&#xD;
only made him keep quiet, leaving the medical&#xD;
question entirely to her husband, and pro-.&#xD;
viding, on her part, dainty invalid dishes and&#xD;
invalid amusement. Vance was charmed, and,&#xD;
if it had not been for that face, of which he&#xD;
had only caught a glimpse-that strange,&#xD;
beautiful, haunting face that had so often&#xD;
shone on him in his dream-he would have&#xD;
asked nothing better than to play invalid in&#xD;
this pleasant, airy chamber, with such a glo-&#xD;
rious mountain-view through the window near&#xD;
at hand, and such a sweet-faced, silver-voiced&#xD;
nurse to redeem even sickness from being&#xD;
dull.&#xD;
This enjoyment was not of long duration,&#xD;
however. On the third day he was emanci--&#xD;
pated from durance, and suffered to make one&#xD;
of the group who with books and work were&#xD;
gathered on the shady lawn not far from the&#xD;
spot where he had been struck down. In three&#xD;
days Travers had managed to make himself&#xD;
thoroughly at. home; and Vance, who knew&#xD;
his free-and-easy ways, was not surprised when&#xD;
he came out with Mrs. Rivers, and found him&#xD;
reading ,aloud to the young ladies, as if he&#xD;
had known them for months instead of days,.&#xD;
Vance himself had none of this genial ease&#xD;
about him. He was, if any thing, a more&#xD;
polished gentleman than his friend, more full&#xD;
of inborn, stately graces, more keenly alive to&#xD;
shades of social courtesy, more full of' social&#xD;
tact, but he lacked almost entirely the gay&#xD;
bonhomie and frank good-fellowship that made&#xD;
Travers so popular wherever he went ; and,&#xD;
lacking this, he lacked every thing that was&#xD;
worth having in the eyes of a great many men&#xD;
and women of the world.&#xD;
" We are all thoroughly charmedi with&#xD;
your friend," Mrs. Rivers said, as they came&#xD;
out of the house together ; and, looking at&#xD;
the group on the lawn, Vance answered, with&#xD;
a smile:&#xD;
" I can well believe that, and I don't won-&#xD;
der at it. Travers is suck a good fellow that&#xD;
hie deserves to charm everybody. He charmed&#xD;
me, I am sure.-How pleasant this looks !" .&#xD;
" We sit here a great deal," said Mrs.&#xD;
Ri'vers ; and, as they approached, she spoke&#xD;
to Marion, who was next her : " My dear, here&#xD;
is Mr. Lorimer, who, I am glad to say, is well&#xD;
enough at last to join us. I hope-"&#xD;
What she hoped was left to conjecture,&#xD;
&#xD;
for, as she spoke, Marion turned round, and&#xD;
her face, thus suddenly presented to Lorimer's&#xD;
gaze, made him stagger back without a word,&#xD;
and sit down in a chair near at hand. For his&#xD;
life he could not help' it. He knew how&#xD;
strangely such conduct must appear ; he knew&#xD;
that three pairs of eyes were regarding him&#xD;
with profound astonishment; he knew how he&#xD;
had prepared himself for this meeting, aware&#xD;
that it must come, but yet he could not help&#xD;
it, and he could not say a word. The weird&#xD;
feeling that we all know when any thing border-&#xD;
ing on the supernatural comes near us seized&#xD;
him without any warning, and, try as he:&#xD;
would, he found himself tongue-tied, with the&#xD;
face of his dream looking at him. It was&#xD;
Travers who spoke first, coming to his rescue&#xD;
with commendable quickness-.&#xD;
"Vance, you shouldn't have forgotten that&#xD;
you are still an invalid. Shall I get you some&#xD;
water ? You look quite faint."&#xD;
" Thank you," said Vance, with a grateful&#xD;
look. Then he glanced up at Marion. " Miss&#xD;
Rivers, pray excuse me. A sudden faintness&#xD;
-a giddiness-quite overcame me. I had no&#xD;
idea I was so weak."&#xD;
"It would be strange if you were not,"&#xD;
said Marion, kindly. " Do sit still. Will you&#xD;
not have a fan?"&#xD;
He took one which she handed to him,&#xD;
laughing to himself the while that he, of all&#xD;
people, should be playing hysterical fine gen-&#xD;
tleman at this rate. Mrs. Rivers sent Travers&#xD;
for some water, and levied upon Miss Forrest&#xD;
for sal-volatile. With the aid of these two&#xD;
restoratives, he was at last allowed to declare&#xD;
himself recovered, and to be believed. After&#xD;
this small excitement subsided, Travers fin-&#xD;
ished one of Aytoun's " Lays " that he had&#xD;
been reading aloud ; and then Richard-that&#xD;
is, Mr. Lorimer-was himself'again. Marion&#xD;
thought him quite as handsome as she had&#xD;
thought him when he lay pale and stunned on&#xD;
the day of the storm; but she could not help&#xD;
noticing-'a woman of perceptions, less quick&#xD;
than her own, must have noticed-that, from&#xD;
some cause, her appearance, her manner, her&#xD;
voice, every thing about her, had a singular&#xD;
attraction for him. It was not exactly admira-&#xD;
tion-she had been too long accustomed to&#xD;
that to mistake it-nor curiosity, nor any&#xD;
thing else for which there is a definite name ;&#xD;
but an interest that puzzled her by its singu-&#xD;
larity, and yet fascinated her by its intentness,.&#xD;
More than once she caught those clear-blue&#xD;
&#xD;
timely.&#xD;
And there, for the time being, the subject&#xD;
dropped.&#xD;
It was renewed again that evening when&#xD;
they were all assembled in the drawing-room,&#xD;
and, thanks to Travers and Nellie, canvassed&#xD;
openly. With some hesitation, Lorimer was&#xD;
induced to tell the story of the dream, of its&#xD;
persistent recurrence, of the face that seemed&#xD;
compelling him to paint it, of the hold it had&#xD;
gained upon him, and, the vivid manner in&#xD;
which it had returned at sight of Marion's&#xD;
face. They were all greatly interested, and&#xD;
every one followed Miss Forrest's lead in&#xD;
professing the greatest curiosity to see the&#xD;
picture-.&#xD;
"If you had onry brought it with you,"&#xD;
said Mr. Rivers, "I would really give any&#xD;
thing for a glimpse of it."&#xD;
&#xD;
114  HE PINTE'S DEAM.THE PAINTER'S DREAM-                                                                         11&#xD;
&#xD;
eyes regarding her with a gaze so keen and&#xD;
strange that it amused, even while it per-.&#xD;
piexed her.&#xD;
- "I wonder what is the matter with me ?"&#xD;
she thought. " People don't usually look at&#xD;
me as if I had lost my nose, or suffered some&#xD;
other calamity of the sort. I must ask Nel-&#xD;
lie what the meaning of it can be."&#xD;
When they went to the house, she carried&#xD;
this intention into execution, and Nellie, in&#xD;
reply, told her the history of the dream-pict-&#xD;
ure which Travers had meanwhile been relat.-&#xD;
ing to her.&#xD;
As may naturally be supposed, Marion was&#xD;
very much excited and interested-the more&#xD;
so when she remembered the exclamation Lori-&#xD;
mner had made on first'seeing her face, and&#xD;
understood now what it meant. ~&#xD;
" But it cannot be!i" she cried. " I must&#xD;
only resemble his picture. It is so strange !&#xD;
-Nellie, I should not like to think it was I !"&#xD;
" Mr. Travers says it might pass for your&#xD;
portrait," Nellie answered. "Every line of&#xD;
the face is identical, and the only difference is&#xD;
in expression. I wish you could have heard&#xD;
him describing the manner in which the pict-&#xD;
ure fascinated Mr. Lorimer. It was to get&#xD;
away from it that they came out here." .&#xD;
"And ran full tilt on the original," said&#xD;
Marion. " It is laughable, and yet it is awe-&#xD;
some. It is like spiritualism or clairvoyant&#xD;
nonsense, Nellie. I don't-I cannot believe it !"&#xD;
" I only know what Mr. Travers told me,"&#xD;
said Nellie. "But I should like amazingly&#xD;
to see the picture and judge for myself."&#xD;
"So should I," returned Marion, medita.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Vance, haven't you the original sketch&#xD;
in your portfolio ?" asked the irrepressible&#xD;
Travers. "Iam almost sure I saw it there the&#xD;
other day."&#xD;
Vance colored, and glanced at Marion.&#xD;
" I believe there is a sketch there," he&#xD;
said. " But it is only a crayon outline. I&#xD;
could not make up my mind to leave every&#xD;
thing about the picture behind."&#xD;
"Show it to us, Mr. Lorimer-pray do,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Rivers.&#xD;
And immediately there rose a chorus&#xD;
of'-&#xD;
" Oh, yes, Mr. Lorimer, pray do !"&#xD;
Lorimer hesitated. Some instinct strongly&#xD;
warned him not to comply with the request-&#xD;
but then, what excuse could he give for re-&#xD;
fusal ? Three or four eager faces were look-&#xD;
ing at him in expectation of his compliance;-&#xD;
and it would seem ungracious and churlish to&#xD;
deny their curiosity this small gratification.&#xD;
Yet it was sorely against his will that itt last&#xD;
.he said :&#xD;
" I will go and look for it."&#xD;
'He was not long gone. The portfolio&#xD;
must have been very near at hand, for he soon&#xD;
returned with a small crayon-sketch, which&#xD;
he gave to Mrs. Rivers.&#xD;
"I am not sure that you will see the like-&#xD;
ness," he said. " This is very carelessly done ;&#xD;
but it is the outline.".&#xD;
It might have been carelessly done, but&#xD;
still there was graphic power in every stroke,&#xD;
and the whole scene was transcribed as for-&#xD;
cibly and clearly, if not quite as elaborately,&#xD;
as on the canvas left behind in the forsaken&#xD;
studio. Mrs. Rivera had evidently been quite&#xD;
unprepared for any thing like this. She ut-&#xD;
tered an exclamation of mingled amazement&#xD;
and admiration when her glance fell on the&#xD;
paper.&#xD;
"What a strongly-drawn scene !" she&#xD;
cried. "Why, this girl is Marion herself!-&#xD;
Mr. Lorimer, it cannot be that you drew it be-&#xD;
fore you saw her !"&#xD;
Lorimer pointed to a date two months&#xD;
back, which was inscribed in a corner of the&#xD;
drawing. " This was the first sketch I made,"&#xD;
he said. " It was drawn on that day."&#xD;
"It is incredible !" cried Mrs. Rivers, using&#xD;
the exclamation as people do, without exactly&#xD;
meaning that it was incredible. Then she&#xD;
held the drawing at arm's-length, and appealed&#xD;
to the company in general. " Look ! did you&#xD;
ever see a more striking likeness ?"&#xD;
&#xD;

116       -THE PAINT:&#xD;
"It is perfect," said Mr. Rivers, looking&#xD;
over her shoulder. " Every feature, every&#xD;
line.-Mr. Lorimer, I would never have be-&#xD;
lieved this excepting from actual sight. And&#xD;
that wan ! Surely, I have seen his face some-&#xD;
where."&#xD;
"I have never seen him," said Vance,&#xD;
quietly. ." I can believe any thing, however,&#xD;
after meeting Miss Rivers."&#xD;
"Let me see," said Nellie, crossing the&#xD;
room. She took the sketch, and the next&#xD;
moment gave a scream.&#xD;
" Good Heavens!i" she cried. " There is&#xD;
something uncanny about this! The girl may&#xD;
be like Marion, but the man is Alston Ray-&#xD;
ford !" -&#xD;
" What!" cried Mr. Rivers, while his wife&#xD;
looked quickly at Vahece, and Marion came&#xD;
forward quite pale.&#xD;
"Give it to me," she said, in a low voice.&#xD;
And, while she took the sketch and stood&#xD;
looking intently at it, there was not a sound&#xD;
audible in the room. Instinctively, the two&#xD;
strangers felt that something awkward had&#xD;
occurred, or was about to occur; and the&#xD;
others all held their breath, gazing at Marion's&#xD;
face. It was not an encouraging face by any&#xD;
means, for it hardened and whitened while&#xD;
they gazed, the sunny beauty fading out of it,&#xD;
and a stern, settled resentment like her father's&#xD;
coming over it. After a minute or two, she&#xD;
laid down the drawing, and looked at Vance.&#xD;
"I suppose Mr. Lorimer means us to be-&#xD;
lieve that this also was part of the dreams"&#xD;
she said, in such a cold and haughty voice&#xD;
that Vance colored and drew himself up, as&#xD;
almost any man would have been apt to do.&#xD;
"It was certainly part of the dream, Miss&#xD;
Rivers,". he answered, as coldly as herself.&#xD;
" That is the first sketch I ever made of it--&#xD;
exactly as it appeared to me then, and has&#xD;
appeared to me always."&#xD;
" And you never saw Mr. Rayford or my-.&#xD;
self before drawing this ?"&#xD;
" I never saw yourself, and, as for Mr.&#xD;
Rayford, I never even heard of him before.&#xD;
If that resembles him, it was from no inten-&#xD;
tion on my part of drawing a likeness of any&#xD;
face save the one seen in my dream."&#xD;
He spoke proudly; for he saw that the in-&#xD;
credulity on Marion's face deepened, instead&#xD;
of disappearing at his words. She glanced at&#xD;
the sketch, and thenrback at him, with a sig-&#xD;
nificance that hardly needed the aid of lan-&#xD;
guage to express its indignant disbelief.&#xD;
&#xD;
HER'S DREAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am sure Marion does not mean-" be-&#xD;
gan Mrs. Rivers, eagerly. But Marion inter-&#xD;
rupted her, coldly.&#xD;
"Excuse me, aunt, but I think Mr. Lorimer&#xD;
understands what I mean. This is a day of&#xD;
marvels," she went on, looking at the young&#xD;
artist ; " and wonders of all kinds abound;&#xD;
but I do not know that I have ever heard any&#xD;
thing like the story you propose to our belief.&#xD;
I am a matter-of-fact person, and this must&#xD;
excuse my incapacity to credit that you drew&#xD;
these striking portraits of Mr. Rayford and&#xD;
myself without ever having seen either of us.&#xD;
Why you should have shown them to me, I&#xD;
cannot imagine. But of one thing I feel sure&#xD;
-that you did well in selecting me, for he&#xD;
would be even less credulous than I have&#xD;
proved."&#xD;
Then she turned, and, without another&#xD;
word, walked out of the room.&#xD;
The group left behind looked at each other&#xD;
as if they had been thunderstruck. Mrs. and&#xD;
Mr. Rivers,,together with Miss Forrest, hardly&#xD;
knew what to say; Travers was overcome&#xD;
with astonishment, and Lorimer was burning&#xD;
with indignation. The latter was the first to&#xD;
speak-walking across the room, and taking&#xD;
up the sketch, while he addressed himself to&#xD;
his host.&#xD;
"I am sorry that, after having made such&#xD;
a charge, Miss Rivers should have gone away&#xD;
without hearing my reply," he said. " I hope,&#xD;
sir, that you will do me the justice to believe&#xD;
that I never saw her until I entered this&#xD;
house, and that I have never seen the gentle-&#xD;
man to whom she alludes. In fact, it is im-&#xD;
possible that I should have done so. I am a&#xD;
Georgian by birth, but I have spent many&#xD;
years in Germany; and, since my return to&#xD;
America, I have lived entirely in Baltimore.&#xD;
With Carolina, and Carolinians, I am wholly&#xD;
unacquainted. As regards the dream, I am&#xD;
unable to offer the least explanation. It has&#xD;
been a mystery to me from the first ; and I&#xD;
need not say that it hast grown even more&#xD;
mysterious since I saw your niece. As she ob-&#xD;
jects to even an accidental likeness of herself&#xD;
remaining in my possession, I can do this-"&#xD;
he rapidly tore the sketch into fragments&#xD;
-" and I must beg you to assure her that the&#xD;
painting shall share the same fate when I go&#xD;
back to Baltimore."&#xD;
"My dear Mr. Lorimer," began Mr. Rivers&#xD;
-but Mrs. Rivers took the matter of reply in-&#xD;
to her hands, and iuite bore him down.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PAINTER'S DREAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Marion is very much to blame, Mr. Lori-&#xD;
mer," she said, eagerly ; " but I am sure she&#xD;
will be very sorry for having spoken so. It is&#xD;
some excuse for her that your drawing placed&#xD;
Mr. Rayford in a very equivocal position. He&#xD;
is a gentleman to whom she is engaged-or,&#xD;
I should say, would be engaged, if her father&#xD;
had not refused his consent. She is staying&#xD;
with us now on account of this ; and of course&#xD;
she is very sensitive about any allusion to&#xD;
him.-Yes, my dear,1I know these are family&#xD;
matters-" this to Nellie, who had entered an&#xD;
aside remonstrance-" but I think Marion's&#xD;
friends owe Mr. Lorimer an explanation of&#xD;
her conduct."&#xD;
"And an apology," said Mr. Rivers, find-&#xD;
ing an opportunity to speak, and embracing it&#xD;
without loss of time. "Mr. Lorimer, I am&#xD;
truly sorry that my niece should have forgot-&#xD;
ten the most common rules of courtesy in this&#xD;
way. If the picture was a likeness of young&#xD;
Rayford-" .&#xD;
"It was a most astonishing likeness," in.-&#xD;
terposed Nellie.&#xD;
"I only saw him once, and my wife never&#xD;
saw him at all," went on Mr. Rivers. "But&#xD;
if it was a likeness, I don't see that it justifies&#xD;
.Marion. In fact, the only thing about it is&#xD;
that it makes the dream more astonishing-so&#xD;
astonishing, that it would puzzle a modern&#xD;
Joseph to read it."&#xD;
" I am not a modern Joseph, but it puzzles&#xD;
me," said Lorimer. " I have had only one&#xD;
decided impression about it from the first-&#xD;
that it would bring mc either very good or,&#xD;
very bad luck. It has already brought me a&#xD;
measure of both, in granting me the pleasure&#xD;
of your acquaintance, and being the cause of&#xD;
my unintentionally offending your niece. I&#xD;
wish very much that she had given me an op-&#xD;
portunity to explain-but then, perhaps, an&#xD;
explanation supported only by assertion would&#xD;
have done no good."&#xD;
"Not with an angry woman, and a woman&#xD;
in love," said Mr. Rivers, shirugging his shoul-&#xD;
ders. "Now, I have one favor to ask-that&#xD;
you will not let this contre-temps shorten your&#xD;
stay with us." *&#xD;
Lorimer looked at Travers, and there was&#xD;
the same unspoken resolve in both pairs of&#xD;
eyes. Then he glanced back at Mr. Rivers.&#xD;
."My dear sir, you are very kind, but there&#xD;
.is no question of shotitening our stay. It has&#xD;
already prolonged itself further than it should&#xD;
have done; and we must leave to-morrow&#xD;
&#xD;
morning. There is nothing for us but to thank&#xD;
you for your hospitality and make our adieux."&#xD;
Mr. Rivers, seconded by his wife and Nel-&#xD;
lie, said all that it was possible to say against&#xD;
this decision; but the two friends remaied&#xD;
firm. No argument or entreaties had any&#xD;
effect on them; and the next morning, bright&#xD;
and early, they took their departure, exchang-&#xD;
ing many cordial farewells with the rest of the&#xD;
family, but not even seeing Marion, who kept&#xD;
her own room.&#xD;
V-&#xD;
THREE weeks passed. By the end of that&#xD;
time, the summer was drawing to a close, and&#xD;
Marion and Nellie were ready to hang them-&#xD;
selves from .sheer ennui. The weekly mail&#xD;
was the only thing that still retained interest&#xD;
for them; and they watched-for this anxiously&#xD;
-hoping each time for the welcome news of a&#xD;
summons home. The summons home did not&#xD;
come, but one day a letter from Mr. Alston&#xD;
Rayford did. Nellie, who opened the post-&#xD;
bag, knew the writing on the envelope, and&#xD;
watched Marion anxiously when it was handed&#xD;
to her. Miss Rivers had a good deal of self-&#xD;
control, however, and she did not betray emo-&#xD;
tion by any sudden start or blush. She only&#xD;
pocketed the missive very quietly, and after a&#xD;
while went up to her own room. When her&#xD;
friend followed, in a flutter of excitement,&#xD;
she found her sitting in an attitude of deep&#xD;
thought, with the letter open in her hand.&#xD;
Miss Forrest was hardly in the room before&#xD;
she broke into eager questioning.&#xD;
" Well, Marion, what is the news ? Has&#xD;
your father at last consented ?"&#xD;
Marion looked up-pale as she always grew&#xD;
when other people would have flushed. '"Con-&#xD;
sented !-Papa ? ", she said. " You might as&#xD;
well ask if the river had flowed backward.&#xD;
No, he has not consented. On the contrary,&#xD;
he has again refused Aiston, in the most in-&#xD;
sulting manner."'&#xD;
"Did Mr. Rayford ask his consent again? "&#xD;
"Yes. He grew impatient. He could not&#xD;
bear the suspense and the long waiting-mm&#xD;
never can, you know-and so he went to papa.&#xD;
He was repulsed-Nellie, I cannot tell you how&#xD;
he was repulsed."&#xD;
" I can imagine," said Nellie, with a signifi-&#xD;
cant shrug.&#xD;
4"Yes-I suppose you can. Well, he was&#xD;
repulsed, and now he has come to me."&#xD;
" Come to you ! Not up here ?"&#xD;

TER'S DREAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
'118                        THE PAIN&#xD;
"Yes, up here. I am sorry, very sorry fo&#xD;
it-I have a contempt for any thing like clan&#xD;
destine prdceedings-.-but he has come, and&#xD;
cannot refuse to see him."&#xD;
"Mr. Rivers will spare you that trouble,'&#xD;
said Nellie, dryly. "I can tell you before&#xD;
hand that he will never allow Mr. Rayford t4&#xD;
meet you in his house."&#xD;
"I have no intention of asking his consent&#xD;
nor of meeting him in this house," said Man&#xD;
on, hayghtily. "Alston is staying, or will in&#xD;
staying soon-this letter was mailed in Mor&#xD;
gantown-at a farmer's near here. I shal&#xD;
meet him in the woods."&#xD;
"Marion!"&#xD;
"Well, what is the matter?"&#xD;
"That seems so-so clandestine, and un&#xD;
worthy of you."&#xD;
"And am I not forced to it? "said Marion&#xD;
flushing; "when Aiston has travelled hun&#xD;
dreds of miles merely to see me, can I send&#xD;
him back without a word? And where should&#xD;
I meet him, excepting in the woods? The hill.&#xD;
side is just as free to him as to us."&#xD;
"I cannot think it is right; but if it must&#xD;
be-when is he to make his appearance?"&#xD;
"That I do not know. Mountain travelling&#xD;
is very uncertain, and he may be in the neigh.&#xD;
boyhood now, or he may not arrive for several&#xD;
days. He has been here before, however, and&#xD;
he appoints a place of rendezvous."&#xD;
"I hope it is a place we know."&#xD;
"Yes. It is the Old Ferry. We can walk&#xD;
there easily, and he can come by the river. It&#xD;
is a lonely place, and there is no danger of&#xD;
meeting anybody."&#xD;
"There never is danger of that in this de.&#xD;
rightful region. And do you want me to bear&#xD;
you company?"&#xD;
"Of course," said Marion, flushing again.&#xD;
"You don't suppose I want to go alone? I&#xD;
know you disapprove of it, Nellie; and so do&#xD;
I, for that matter. Bet I cannot refuse-and&#xD;
it is only for once."&#xD;
"I hope it may prove only for once," said&#xD;
Nellie, anxiously. "Do we go this after.&#xD;
noon?"&#xD;
"I think we had better do so."&#xD;
So that afternoon they donned their hats&#xD;
and set forth, disappointing the children very&#xD;
much by declining to take them along, but&#xD;
otherwise going as if for one of their usual&#xD;
rambles. They followed a path round the hills,&#xD;
and soon came to the place of rendezvous-a&#xD;
beautiful nook of the river where a disused&#xD;

THE PAINTER'S DREAM.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
r, road swept down to what had once been a&#xD;
ferry, and which still retained the distinction&#xD;
I of the name, though it had long since lost the&#xD;
distinction of the fact. Here they sat down to&#xD;
rest, with very little expectation of seeing Mr.&#xD;
- Rayford that afternoon. They were destined&#xD;
to a surprise, however; for they had hardly&#xD;
finished agi~eeing that he would not come, and&#xD;
begun talking of views and perspective, and&#xD;
the lovely mountain.scenes before them, when&#xD;
3 there was a dash of oars in the water; a small&#xD;
skiff shot round' a bend of the stream, and,&#xD;
1 in another moment, Mr. Alston Rayford bad&#xD;
sprung on shore and stood before them.&#xD;
He, looked as eager and handsome as a&#xD;
man should look when he is engaged in a ro-&#xD;
inantic love.adventure; but he came forward&#xD;
and made his greetings with a graceful defer-&#xD;
ence which quite ignored the fact that this&#xD;
meeting did .not take place on a drawing.room&#xD;
carpet. He was a very fine gentleman, there&#xD;
* was not a doubt of that; and his manners&#xD;
and appearance were unexceptionable. Yet,&#xD;
strangely enough, Marion's first sensation&#xD;
was one of disappointment-seek disappoint.&#xD;
mont as many a girl has felt when, after long&#xD;
* absence~ the hero of her dreams is sudd~nIy&#xD;
brought before her in his own proper pei~son.&#xD;
It is clearly impossible to guard against such&#xD;
revulsions, since all women create illusions for&#xD;
themselves, and all illusions must sooner or&#xD;
later be broken. So perhaps it is as good a&#xD;
test as any for true love, whether or not it&#xD;
can survive the inevitable hour when glamour&#xD;
fades nnd sober daylight comes in. This test&#xD;
was now to be applied to Marion's love; but&#xD;
such things are not decided in a moment, or&#xD;
in many moments-only it was unpromising,&#xD;
to say the least, that her first sensation was&#xD;
not of joy, or welcome, or pride, but of sud-&#xD;
den, chill disappointment. Yet, what disap-&#xD;
pointed her she could not possibly have told.&#xD;
The Alston Rayford she had known, the Al-&#xD;
ston Rayford she had wished and even prom-&#xD;
ised to marry, stood before her, unchanged by&#xD;
even so much as a shade; and yet, something&#xD;
was gone. The glamour of fancy bad faded,&#xD;
daylight had come in, and it remained for the&#xD;
future to show whether himself an4 the love&#xD;
he had inspired would stand the searching test&#xD;
of that daylight.&#xD;
Before long, Miss Forrest wandered away&#xD;
on a professedly botanical exclusion, and left&#xD;
the lovers to themselves. The conversation&#xD;
which ensued was very animated, and some-&#xD;
&#xD;
times even verged on excitement. She could "What is the matter, Marion? You look&#xD;
see that, though she could hear nothing from worried."&#xD;
the hill-side perch where she had established "I am worried," said Marion, briefly.&#xD;
herself, and where her botanical researches "About your father?"&#xD;
consisted of poking at a bunch of ferns with "No-about Alaton,"&#xD;
the point of her parasol. She was not at all "Indeed! What has he done?"&#xD;
romantically inclined, and she could not help "He is foolish and inconsiderate enough&#xD;
wishing, for her own sake as well as for to urge me to elope with him"&#xD;
Marion's, that Aiston Rayford had stayed at "0-h!" Miss Forrest shrugged her&#xD;
home, and had not forced this" highly-improp. shoulders. "Well, my dear, I don't know&#xD;
en 'proceeding upon them. It was tiresome- that you have any right to be worried or as-&#xD;
very tiresome-this sitting on a stone, with tonished at that. Of course, it is what you&#xD;
nothing but her own thoughts and a bunch of might have expected."&#xD;
ferns to amuse her, while Mr. Rayfond talked "What I might have expected!" repeated&#xD;
on and on, in the most unconscionable manner, Mtirion, with her color rising. "I don't know&#xD;
and seemed urging Marion to something which what you mean, Nell. I think that I might&#xD;
Marion plainly refused. Miss Forrest yawned, hare expected some respect from Mr. Rayford.&#xD;
and wondered how long she would have to I consider this next to an insult."&#xD;
watch this discussion in dumb show. "It is "And I consider that you are very Un.&#xD;
as good as a pantomime," she said to herself; reasonable. Mr. Rayford wants to put some&#xD;
but, somehow, it was not as amusing as a definite end to this very indefinite state of&#xD;
pantomime. Then she caught a profile view affairs, and I ~am sure I cannot blame him.&#xD;
of Mr. Rayford's face, and something about it Pray tell me what you seriously expect of&#xD;

men had torn up, and set her at work consid- cept him as a legitimate suitor, and you are&#xD;

how she scarcely blamed Marion for being in- Where is ~he middle ground between these&#xD;
credulous (as Marion still continued) of the two things?"&#xD;
dream-story which purported to excuse it. "Can he not wait? I am willing to do so.&#xD;
Then her thoughts wandered away, following And patience conquers all things."&#xD;
the erratic footsteps of the two young artists "My dear child, some good might come of&#xD;
who had come so suddenly into her life, and waiting if Mr. Rayford was a paladin, and you&#xD;
gone so abruptly out of it; and she was punch- were an angel. Butt as it is, nothing but un-&#xD;

the sinking sun. She stood up, however, and "iVhat is the drift of all this, Nell? I&#xD;

walking toward her, having done so. I am only saying that it i~&#xD;
Marion looked vexed and overclouded, and what any man would do."&#xD;

&#xD;
item of steadfastness. At last she looked&#xD;
up.&#xD;
"You are right, Nell," she said; "and you&#xD;
need not talk of the selfishness of men, for I&#xD;
am sure no man was ever more selfish than I&#xD;
have been. I forgot entirely that all the bur-&#xD;
den of a prolonged engagement would fall on&#xD;
Alston; and 1 have held him boundwhen 1&#xD;
ought to have set him free long ago. I will&#xD;
make amends in the only way I can, and that&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
." By eloping ? " asked Nell, in sudden&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
"No. By putting a final end to our en-&#xD;
gagement. Why should you look so sur-&#xD;
prised? I am sure you have shown me that&#xD;
it is the only right thing to do."&#xD;
"But, Marion! You-you are in love&#xD;
with him!"&#xD;
"Not much," said Marion, coolly. "Not&#xD;
enough to break my heart about setting him&#xD;
free. But, if it did break my heart, and it&#xD;
was right, it should be done."&#xD;
"But you will not s~,e him again?"&#xD;
"Yes. He insisted that I should meet&#xD;
him to-morrow afternoon. I refused, but I&#xD;
am very sure he will come to the ferry. When&#xD;
I parted from him, I did not mean to go; but&#xD;
now I shalL"                         -&#xD;
"He will think you are coming to elope&#xD;
with him."&#xD;
"He wilibe mistaken, then."&#xD;
This sentence ended the conversation; for,~&#xD;
just here, the children came unexpectedly&#xD;
trooping from a by-path, and were all so full&#xD;
of a wonderful nest of snakes that one of the&#xD;
servants had discovered, and into which he&#xD;
had carried wholesale destruction and ravage,&#xD;
that their tongues did not once cease running&#xD;
until the party reached home.&#xD;
The next day Miss Forrest was confined to&#xD;
her chamber with a headache, which she de-&#xD;
clared was solely the result of the unusual&#xD;
mental exertion to which she had been driven&#xD;
on the precedingafternoon.&#xD;
"You see, I had nothing to do but think&#xD;
while I was out on the hill-side punching at&#xD;
those ferns," she said; "and, not being 'used&#xD;
to so much thinking at one time, it has made&#xD;
my bead ache as if-really, as if it would&#xD;
split!&#xD;
Under these circumstances, it was of course&#xD;
clearly impossible that Marion could ask her&#xD;
to submit to the same ordeal again. So, re-&#xD;
luctantly enough, she resigned herself to the&#xD;
&#xD;
necessity of meeting Mr. Rayford at the Old&#xD;
Ferry quite alone. When the afternoon wore&#xD;
on, and the sun began to cast long shadows&#xD;
across the green turf; she took her hat and a&#xD;
book, and set forth unchallenged to keep her&#xD;
tryst.&#xD;
It was not a long walk to the appointed&#xD;
place, and, when~ she reached there, she found&#xD;
Mr. Rayford's boat made fast to the bank, and&#xD;
Mr. Rayford himself pacing to and fro in all&#xD;
the impatience of mingled doubt and expecta-&#xD;
tion. When he caught sight of Marion's white&#xD;
dress, he rushed forward to meet her, and&#xD;
poured forth his thanks so warm and fast, that&#xD;
at last she was forced to check them.&#xD;
"Please don't thank me any more," she&#xD;
said, "at least not until you hear why I have&#xD;
come. You may feel obliged to me when you&#xD;
do hear; but then, again, you may not."&#xD;
"I feel obliged to any thing that gives me&#xD;
a sight of your face, Marion, even if you mean&#xD;
to refuse again the prayer I have come to&#xD;
urge."&#xD;
"I don't mean to discuss that," she said,&#xD;
hurriedly. "I gave you my answer-the only&#xD;
answer I have to give-yesterday afternoon.&#xD;
No, Aiston. I blive come to do something&#xD;
much more kind. I have come to release you."&#xD;
"To do what, Marion?"&#xD;
"To give you your freedom from bondage,"&#xD;
said she, trying to smile and speak high~ly.&#xD;
"I ought to have done it long ago; but indeed&#xD;
it ne~-er struck me, until after I parted with&#xD;
you yesterday, how selfishly I have been act-&#xD;
ing in keeping you bound. Papa will never&#xD;
coilsent, I am sure; and I-I cannot elope.&#xD;
Aiston, dear Aiston, will it not be better for us&#xD;
to part?"&#xD;
She looked up at him with her eyes full of&#xD;
'half.sad appeal-when is any thing that deals&#xD;
with parting not sad ?-and she met in return&#xD;
a simplyincredulous surprise.&#xD;
"This is not like you, Marion," he said.&#xD;
"Some women make nothing of such words as&#xD;
these; but you are not one of them-and it is&#xD;
not like you. There is not-there never can&#xD;
be-any question of parting between us."&#xD;
"You are mistaken," said Marion, who was&#xD;
not likely to be borne down in this sort of&#xD;
way. "There is a question, and a very serious&#xD;
question of it. Alston, what do we gain by&#xD;
holding on as we have been doing?"&#xD;
"We gain the prospect of happiness, Ma-&#xD;
rion; and we might gain the certainty, if you&#xD;
would only yield to me."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
~C You mean if I would elope?"&#xD;
"I mean if you would marry me, without&#xD;
waiting for a consent that your father will&#xD;
never give.&#xD;
"And would you be willing to marry a&#xD;
woman who could do such a thing, Aiston?&#xD;
I should think you would distrust her, even&#xD;
where you were concerned. I can never do&#xD;
that. So the only thing left us is to part."&#xD;
"You say that very coolly, Marion. Has&#xD;
absence, then, worked its usual effect? has it&#xD;
taken youi' heart from me?"&#xD;
"If that were so, Aiston, do you think I&#xD;
would be standing here now? No. I love&#xD;
you as much as I ever did; but I have grown&#xD;
a little older, and a little wiser, since I prom-&#xD;
ised to hold fast for a lifetime, if need be; and&#xD;
I see that it would be more selfish than kind&#xD;
to do so. If you only knew-"&#xD;
"I know this," he interrupted, passion-&#xD;
ntely, "that while you talk, I feel; and that I&#xD;
will not give you up at the bidding of a thou-&#xD;
sand fathers-nor at your own, either. I have&#xD;
never yet surrendered any thingthat was mine&#xD;
once; and you are mine now, Marion!"&#xD;
"I am yours only as long as I do not claim&#xD;
my freedom," said Marion, a little haughtily.&#xD;
"You are mine until death comes between&#xD;
us," repeated her lover; and over his hand-&#xD;
come face there came the "Rayford look "-a&#xD;
look well known wherever the desperate, fear-&#xD;
less Rayford blood had planted itself; and&#xD;
which had never yet boded good to any one&#xD;
who crossed their path, or disputed their reck-&#xD;
less, determined will. "You are mine, and,&#xD;
once for all, I will notgiveyouup!"&#xD;
Marion drew back proudly. It was a ques-&#xD;
tion whether she had ever really loved this&#xD;
man, but at least it was certain that she had&#xD;
never loved him well enough to submit to such&#xD;
language as this from him.&#xD;
"You forget yourself," she said. "If I&#xD;
choose to dissolve our engagement, you will&#xD;
have no alternative but to give me up."&#xD;
"And do you mean to choose to do so?"&#xD;
said he, in a quiet, steady tone-a tone which,&#xD;
if she had known much of the Rayfords, would&#xD;
have warned her that nothing moderately was&#xD;
coming.&#xD;
"Yes, I mean it," asnwered she, coldly-&#xD;
and then, breaking down into pathos, "Aiston,&#xD;
dear Alston, it is for your sake more than mine.&#xD;
Believe me, it is best!"&#xD;
He smiled slightly, and bent his head down&#xD;
until his face was on a level with, her own.&#xD;

"Tell me one thing, Marion," he said. "Do&#xD;
you love me?"&#xD;
"You know that I do," she answered,&#xD;
simply.&#xD;
"Then throw these miserable scruples to&#xD;
the winds, and give yourself to me. See!&#xD;
All that you will need to do is to step into&#xD;
this boat. I have a license in my pocket; six&#xD;
miles below here a magistrate lives. Before&#xD;
the sun goes down, you can be my wife-so&#xD;
that all the fathers in the world cannot part&#xD;
us again."&#xD;
"You might spare me this," she said, half.&#xD;
indignantly, half-reproachfully. "if you ar-&#xD;
gued forever, Alston, you could not make me&#xD;
do such a thing."&#xD;
"Then I must try something besides argu-&#xD;
ment," said he, coolly. "Forgive me, Marion;&#xD;
but you have only your own own obstinacy to&#xD;
blame; and I have sworn that I will never&#xD;
give you up!"&#xD;
Something in his voice, something in his&#xD;
eyes, made a sudden fear rush over Marion.&#xD;
She remembered" the loneliness of the spot,&#xD;
and the desperation ever synonymous with the&#xD;
Rayford name. What was coming she hardly&#xD;
knew, but she drew back with an instinct of&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
"I do not understand you," she said.&#xD;
"What do you mean?"&#xD;
"Imean this," said Rayford, quietly, " that&#xD;
if you will not go with me I shall be forced to&#xD;
take you!"&#xD;
"To take mc! Are you mad?"&#xD;
"No; 1 am only determined not to be&#xD;
played with in this way. It depended upon&#xD;
yourself whether or not you would promise&#xD;
to s~arry me. You did promise, and now it&#xD;
depends upon me whether or not you fulfil it."&#xD;
He spoke in a tone of ordinary composure;&#xD;
but, by a single step, he cut oft' all chance of&#xD;
escape by placing himself in her homeward&#xD;
path.&#xD;
One glance at his face showed her how&#xD;
fully he meant every word he had uttered;&#xD;
how worse* than useless any thing like argu-&#xD;
ment or entreaty would be; and all the love&#xD;
she had ever felt for him sunk down and died&#xD;
in that instant. . She forgot, the peril of her&#xD;
position-she only remembered the burning&#xD;
sen$e of outrage that rushed over her.&#xD;
"You are a coward!" she said, bitterly.&#xD;
"It is only a coward who would endeavor to&#xD;
intimidate a woman by threats, or force her&#xD;
by compulsion, to become his wife. And you&#xD;

THE FAINTER'S DREAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
need not think that you will force me. I would&#xD;
throw myself into the river there before I&#xD;
would marry you after this. I see now that&#xD;
my father was right-right to withhold his&#xD;
consent-right to say that I should never&#xD;
marry you! I thought you were a gentle-&#xD;
man. He knew t~ll'the time that you were a&#xD;
rascal! "'&#xD;
Rayford answered not a' word; perhaps&#xD;
because he could not'trust himself to do so;&#xD;
hut his lips'set themselvcs'like steel, and into&#xD;
his eyes there came a gleam which made even&#xD;
Marioi~'s brave heart sink within her. He&#xD;
bent down-still without a word-and lifted&#xD;
her in his arms. She struggled violently; but&#xD;
her strength was like a child's compared to&#xD;
his, and he bore her into the boat. Then he&#xD;
held her back with one arm, while he loosened&#xD;
the little craft from its anchorage, and pushed&#xD;
out into the stream. When several yards lay&#xD;
between them and the bank, he turned and&#xD;
looked at her, with a flash of triumph on his&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"You may resign yourself, Marion," he&#xD;
said. "You will not go back there until you&#xD;
go as my wife."&#xD;
"We will see about that," she answered,&#xD;
as haughtily and as steadily as if she had not&#xD;
been shaken by a perfect storm of emotion.&#xD;
Then she gathered her dress about her-made&#xD;
one spring-and was in the river.&#xD;
YL&#xD;
INSTANTLY Rayford followed, and the whirl-&#xD;
ing splash of eddying water rendered him&#xD;
quite unconscious that there was a spectator&#xD;
of the drama-that a man,' who was seated on&#xD;
a bluff overhanging the stream, had ivitnessed&#xD;
the whole scene, and that he now manifested&#xD;
* his presence by springing into' the river al-&#xD;
most -as soon as Marion herself had' touched&#xD;
its i~fhce. '&#xD;
Owing to his haste and agitation, Rayford&#xD;
plunged into the water just where he was&#xD;
standing,' Which handedd to be at the end of&#xD;
the bbat-'opposite' that from which 'Marion&#xD;
madehj~ecklessi leap; and, as the boat ian- I&#xD;
medintely swung round and came between&#xD;
them,~he' had some difficulty in reaching her.&#xD;
Mean*hlte she sunk, and, in rising, was swept&#xD;
by the current' gently down-stream, straight&#xD;
into the aims of the stranger, who was mak-&#xD;
ing with quick, sure strokes towa'rd~her. She&#xD;
thought that he was Rayford; but there is&#xD;
nothing like a cold bath for curing heroics;&#xD;
&#xD;
and, with this terrible rush of water in her&#xD;
ears, this frightful sense of helpless danger,&#xD;
she was glad to be rescued-even by him.&#xD;
So she made no resistance when he sup-&#xD;
ported her with one arm, while, with the other,&#xD;
he struck out rapidly for the boat, which, in&#xD;
the course of floating lazily down-stream, was&#xD;
now quite near them.&#xD;
Having reached it, he laid her in' the bot-&#xD;
torn of it, and then climbed in hirnself After&#xD;
accomplishing this, he left her unattended for&#xD;
a moment, while he took up an oar, and, with&#xD;
one vigorous stroke, put two or three yards&#xD;
between themselves and Rayford, who was&#xD;
swimming toward them. The latter, seeing this,&#xD;
raised himself in the water, and gave an angry&#xD;
shout.&#xD;
"Stop!" he cried. "What arc you about?&#xD;
Don't you see that I am trying to reach the&#xD;
boat?"&#xD;
The other raised his hand, and pointed to&#xD;
the shore.&#xD;
"You had better try to reach that," he&#xD;
said, coolly. "You are not coming in here.&#xD;
Keep back! By the Heaven above us, if you&#xD;
even so much as lay your hand on the boat, I&#xD;
will break this oar over your head!"&#xD;
It was not necessary to look in his face to&#xD;
see that he meant what he said; and, the oar&#xD;
uplifted by that stalwart arm, was such a far&#xD;
from pleasant sight, that AlstonRayford had&#xD;
no alternative but to do as he was bidden, and&#xD;
keep back. He was fairly divided between as-&#xD;
tonishment and indignation-as his next words&#xD;
showed.&#xD;
"You insolent rascal!" he cried; "do&#xD;
you know that you are in my boat; and what&#xD;
the devil do you mean by such conduct?"&#xD;
"I mean that if I allowed you to enter&#xD;
here, it would only be for the satisfaction of&#xD;
pitching you out again, and letting you feel&#xD;
that no maii in my presence insults a woman&#xD;
with impunity," was the stern reply. "Take&#xD;
yourself to the shore as best you can, and re-&#xD;
member that if you are seen or heard of again&#xD;
about here, it will be the worse for you."&#xD;
"I will be seen and heard of long enough&#xD;
to make you answer for this, you infernal&#xD;
scoundrel !" Mr. Rayford's language did not&#xD;
improve as 'his excitement* increased;' and&#xD;
there ~vas a tinge of the ludicrous in his posi-&#xD;
tion which added tenfold to his rage. "Who&#xD;
are you, and what right have you to interfere&#xD;
in a matter which does not concern you?"&#xD;
"It makes no difference to you who I am,"&#xD;

&#xD;
the other answered. "As for my right, it is&#xD;
that of any honest man to defend a woman&#xD;
against a villain. Now go; I shall waste no&#xD;
more words on you."&#xD;
He rowed away as he spoke; and Rayford,&#xD;
seeing that he was indeed hopelessly left be-&#xD;
hind, sent one last shot after him:&#xD;
"You shall answer for this; remember&#xD;
that!"&#xD;
The other raised his hand in ironical salute.&#xD;
"I shall be very happy to answer-with a&#xD;
horsewhip," he replied.&#xD;
Having made this rejoinder, he turned and&#xD;
glanced at Marion. To his surprise and relief&#xD;
she was sitting up, and, although she might&#xD;
have passed for a mermaid in the item of&#xD;
drenching, she did not look at all the worse&#xD;
for it in the way of physical well-being. She&#xD;
was not even pale, as people are apt to be af-&#xD;
ter a drowning escapade, but, on the contrary,&#xD;
a tide of color swept over her face the moment&#xD;
those bright-blue eyes fell on it. Before she&#xD;
could speak, she held out her hand.&#xD;
"You have done me an inestimable ser-&#xD;
vice, Mr. Lorimer," she said. "The only re-&#xD;
turn I can make is-to beg your pardon."&#xD;
"I am very glad-more than glad-that I&#xD;
was near," said Lorimer, earnestly. "As I&#xD;
don't want you to think me an eavesdropper, I&#xD;
will explain in a moment how it chanced.&#xD;
But, first, you must take a restorative." He&#xD;
drew a small flask from his pocket, and gave&#xD;
it to her. "I don't suppose that you like&#xD;
French brandy," he went on, "but there is&#xD;
no help for it; you must drink this, or take a&#xD;
cold."&#xD;
"Of eQurse, then, I will drink this," said&#xD;
Marion, with unusual meekness. And she&#xD;
drank it accordingly - in homo~opathic&#xD;
amount.&#xD;
Vance laughed, and shrugged his shoul-&#xD;
ders when the flask was returned, apparently&#xD;
containing the same quantity as when he had&#xD;
given it to her. But he did not urge the mat.&#xD;
ter any further; he only swept the boat&#xD;
round a$ began rowing vigorously against&#xD;
the stream. After a little, he asked Marion&#xD;
if she knew how to use an oar. She answered&#xD;
in the affirmative, and he pointed to one that&#xD;
lay in the bottom of the boat.&#xD;
"Then you had better take that," he said.&#xD;
"We ought to reach Mr. Rivers's as soon as&#xD;
possible."&#xD;
"What!" (She cbuld not help a slight&#xD;
start.) "Are we going there?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Of course. Where else should we go?&#xD;
It cannot be far off either. Do you know how&#xD;
far?"&#xD;
"About a mile, I suppose-by the stream,&#xD;
that is; not half so far by land."&#xD;
"We will reach there soon, then; and, if&#xD;
you can row, the exercise will keep you from&#xD;
taking cold."&#xD;
"1 can try," she said. And she did try.&#xD;
She was not very skilful, however; and it is~&#xD;
doubtful whether her unaided exertions would&#xD;
have brought them very speedily to their&#xD;
bourn; but Lorimer was a first-class oarsman,&#xD;
and his swift, steady strokes sent the little&#xD;
boat fairly dancing over the water. They swept&#xD;
by the Old Ferry in gallant style, and both of&#xD;
them looked instinctively to see if Rayford&#xD;
was there. But he had vanished. In his stead,&#xD;
a slight, graceful figure was seated on a fallen&#xD;
tree, sketching, and whistling pensively; and&#xD;
Lorimer laughed as Marion exclaimed, "Mr.&#xD;
Travers 1"&#xD;
"Shall we take him in?" asked Vance.&#xD;
And t'hen he answered himself, with prompti-&#xD;
tude: "No. I have a good deal to say to&#xD;
you, and he can easily walk.-Frank, old fel-&#xD;
low, meet us at Philippi," he shouted; and&#xD;
Travers started, looked up, and immediately&#xD;
became so transfixed with astonishment that&#xD;
they shot by and out of sight before he was&#xD;
able to say a word.&#xD;
"Now," said Vance, "I have my explana-&#xD;
tion to make, and it must be done quickly.&#xD;
First, however, Miss Rivers, I must ask a ques-&#xD;
tion, and beg a candid answer. Will you tell&#xD;
me if you are still incredulous of my dream?"&#xD;
Marion started, and blushed scarlet. But,&#xD;
nevertheless, she lifted her eyes and answered&#xD;
at once:&#xD;
"I thought you understood what I meani&#xD;
when I begged your pardon, Mr. Lorimer. It&#xD;
was for my incredulity, as well as for my rude-&#xD;
ness, that I did so. Did you witness the whole&#xD;
of the scene?"&#xD;
"Yes, the whole of it"&#xD;
"Then you can, perhaps, believe that I&#xD;
thought of you and your picture at the very&#xD;
moment when that-that man laid hold of me.&#xD;
At the very moment when your scene was&#xD;
realized, the scene itself rose up as unexpect-&#xD;
edly and vividly as if it had been held before&#xD;
my eyes. I saw it as clearly as I see you this&#xD;
moment; and I felt-ah 1 you cannot even&#xD;
imagine what I felt."&#xD;
"I know what I felt myself," he said,&#xD;

&#xD;
quickly. " I ought to explain at once that I&#xD;
was sitting just above you on that bluff which&#xD;
is covered with such luxuriant foliage. Frank&#xD;
and I have been over into Tennessee since we&#xD;
left your uncle's house three weeks ago, and&#xD;
we meant to go round through South Carolina&#xD;
on our way home. But-well, we could not&#xD;
do it. I don't know what made him anxious&#xD;
to return this way; but I am perfectly sure&#xD;
that it was the fascination of the picture-the&#xD;
'same fascination which has made me dream&#xD;
of it every night since we left here--that&#xD;
brought me back, whether I would or no. We&#xD;
did not mean to call at your uncle's; but still&#xD;
we found ourselves to-day wandering almost&#xD;
within sight of the house. Suddenly, in the&#xD;
course of our rambles, we came upon this&#xD;
nook on the river. I cannot tell you what a&#xD;
shock it gave me, for I recognized at once the&#xD;
scene of my dream!"&#xD;
" That is why it has seemed so strangely&#xD;
familiar to me," said Marion. " It was like&#xD;
something I had seen, and yet, until this after-&#xD;
noon, I could not tell what it was. 0 Mr.&#xD;
Lorimer, how unaccountable - how terrible&#xD;
it is !" -&#xD;
"I climbed up to that bluff;" Lorimer&#xD;
went on; " and after a while Frank wandered&#xD;
away and left me. I had been there some&#xD;
time, and, in the drowsy afternoon heat, I went&#xD;
to sleep. I was waked by your voice, and&#xD;
the first words told me what kind of a discus-&#xD;
-sion was going on. I looked down, and I saw&#xD;
the boat and the man!/ After that, I don't&#xD;
think I could have stirred or made a sound&#xD;
if my life had depended on it. I hope you&#xD;
will forgive me for listening to much that no&#xD;
third person should have heard ; and I hope&#xD;
you will also believe me when I tell you that&#xD;
there was some strong influence at work to&#xD;
make me do so. I could not shake off a power&#xD;
that seemed to hold me nerveless. The very&#xD;
scene, the very figures of my dream, were&#xD;
before me. I felt sure of what was coming,&#xD;
and, as you know, it did come."&#xD;
" Yes," she said, under her breath.&#xD;
" If you had waited only one second, you&#xD;
would have been spared a cold bath, for I&#xD;
was all ready to swim after the boat, and I&#xD;
would have gained it. Even as it was, I think&#xD;
our plunges were simultaneous; and I still&#xD;
feel as if I had been defrauded of a just en-&#xD;
joyment, since I did not take that scoundrel&#xD;
by the neck and pitch him headlong into the&#xD;
water."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I think you punished him enough," said&#xD;
she, coloring deeply and painfully. " To such&#xD;
a man there is no punishment like failure.&#xD;
And, if you add ridicule, I am sure you make&#xD;
something which will prove almost too bitter&#xD;
for his endurance."&#xD;
"At least, he will not be apt to trouble&#xD;
you again."&#xD;
"No; for he only troubled mc through my&#xD;
own headstrong folly ; and he will never have&#xD;
that aid again. But when I think of all I&#xD;
owe to you, Mr. Lorimer, and of all that I said&#xD;
to you-"&#xD;
"Nay," said Lorimer, interrupting her&#xD;
with a smile, " we will not think of that at all,&#xD;
My story was certainly strange enough to ex-&#xD;
cuse incredulity. I myself can offer no ex-&#xD;
planation of it, unless "-here his voice sunk&#xD;
-" I was chosen in this way that I might&#xD;
have the happiness of serving you."&#xD;
" Then I never can be grateful enough&#xD;
that you were chosen," said she, looking up,&#xD;
with a warm light in her eyes. "1 am sure--&#xD;
But here we are at the lawn, and yonder is&#xD;
Uncle George ! What can we possibly say to&#xD;
him?" .&#xD;
"I shall say that you were imprudent&#xD;
enough to fa31 into the river, and that I was&#xD;
fortunate enough to pass by and pick you&#xD;
up," said Lorimer, laughing. " Trust to me,&#xD;
and keep your countenance.-My dear sir, I&#xD;
am'delighted to see you again.-Now, Miss&#xD;
Rivers, you had better go to the house and&#xD;
change your dress."&#xD;
"Good Heavens, Marion! what have you'&#xD;
been doing ?" cried her uncle, with astonish-&#xD;
nment.-" Mr. Lorimer, 1 am truly delighted to&#xD;
see you again ; but why, bless my soul! you&#xD;
are wet, too !"&#xD;
" Mr. Lorimer will tell you the whole, story,&#xD;
uncle. It is too long for me," said Marion,&#xD;
laughing. Then she waved her hand, and&#xD;
darted away to the house.&#xD;
It was a long story, certainly; but, never-&#xD;
theless, it was all poured into Miss Forrest's&#xD;
eager ears before the supper-bell rang, and&#xD;
great was the wonderment which, it caused&#xD;
that young lady. She worked herself into&#xD;
such a passion of indignation against there de-&#xD;
feated Rayford, and such a fever of excite-&#xD;
ment about the victorious Lorimer, that she&#xD;
quite cured her headache; and, when several&#xD;
noisy shouts from the children informed her&#xD;
that Travers had arrived, she even g(It up and&#xD;
began to make a toilet. "It would be too&#xD;

&#xD;
discourteous not to see them," she said. "Be-&#xD;
sides, I am dying to talk it over with Mr.&#xD;
Lorimer, and this is my only chance, for no&#xD;
doubt they will leave to-morrow."&#xD;
-She was mistaken, however. The two&#xD;
young artists did not leave on the morrow.&#xD;
"From some cause, the hospitable freedom of&#xD;
Mr. Rivers's household threw quite a spell&#xD;
over them, and they lingered, and still lin-&#xD;
gered, for pleasant walks, and rides, and talks,&#xD;
until the gold of September burned on the&#xD;
chestnuts, and her royal color glowed in the&#xD;
scarlet of the maples-until the mellow haze&#xD;
of autumn ,rounded and softened the grand&#xD;
mountain outlines, and the chill mountain&#xD;
nights made them draw closely around spar-&#xD;
kling fires; lingered, in fact, until Mr. Rivers,&#xD;
hearing that Alston Rayford had sailed for&#xD;
Europe, came for his daughter, and, to his&#xD;
utter consternation, had another suitor thrown,&#xD;
like a petard, at his head.&#xD;
It was all the worse, since there was no&#xD;
reasonable ground for refusal in this instance.&#xD;
There was no better blood between the Poto-&#xD;
mac and the Rio Grande than that which&#xD;
flowed infVance Lorimer's veins; and, although&#xD;
a practical man like Mr. Rivera looked rather&#xD;
askance at "a painter," still he was also a&#xD;
sensible man, and he saw stuff in the young&#xD;
&#xD;
artist which promised well for future effort&#xD;
and future distinction. So, with some reluc-&#xD;
tance, he gave his consent, declaring, as he did&#xD;
so, that if a woman were shut up in an under-&#xD;
ground dungeon, or condemned to roost in&#xD;
the top of a pine-tree, she would find ways&#xD;
and means to compass a love-affair.&#xD;
It had long been an agreement between&#xD;
Marion and Nellie that whichever was married&#xD;
first should claim the services of the other as&#xD;
bridesmaid. But circumstances occurred to&#xD;
prevent the fulfilment of this engagement,&#xD;
and, instead of wearing the orange-wreath by&#xD;
turns, they wore it on the same day. In other&#xD;
words, there was a double wedding ; and&#xD;
people say yet that there never were two&#xD;
prettier brides than Mrs. Lorimer 'and Mrs.&#xD;
Travers.&#xD;
Vance did not fulfil his threat of cutting&#xD;
up the Dream Picture. It hangs in his private&#xD;
room, where strangers'never see it; but some-&#xD;
times it is shown to an intimate friend, and&#xD;
the 'story of it is told. At such times Vance&#xD;
always concludes by assuring them of the ex-&#xD;
act truth of every particular, and declaring&#xD;
(in which we can most of us agree with him)&#xD;
that "there are more things in heaven and&#xD;
earth than are dreamed of in our philoso-&#xD;

POWELL VARDRAY'S LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
At last the weary term was over, and the&#xD;
welcome two-months' vacation came-came to&#xD;
the long class-rooms, outside the windows of&#xD;
which heavy tropical foliage drooped, and into&#xD;
which fragrant tropical breezes swept, even as&#xD;
it came -to other class-rooms under paler skies.&#xD;
where lighter foliage drooped, and fresher&#xD;
breezes played, far away in the fair temperate&#xD;
zone. Some smiling, some sighing, yet all&#xD;
glad to go, the pupils took their departure.&#xD;
Most of the teachers followed their example as&#xD;
speedily as possible, and, after a day or two&#xD;
of bustle and confusion, the great pensionnat&#xD;
which was usually such a busy hive of life,&#xD;
sank into strange silence, and the half-dozen&#xD;
teachers and pupils remaining, moved about&#xD;
the wide* dormitories, the long galleries, and&#xD;
vacant "classes'" like unreal shadows of what&#xD;
had been. In all the British West Indies there&#xD;
was no school so popular as this which had&#xD;
been established in Kingston, by an enter-&#xD;
prising Frenchwoman, and the pupils thus&#xD;
stranded on its shore, were from the neighbor-&#xD;
ing islands, and either meant to spend the, va-&#xD;
cation in the school, or else were awaiting the&#xD;
first opportunity to go home. The teachers&#xD;
were all foreign. There was a middle-aged&#xD;
German with a painfully-long neck, and pain-&#xD;
fully short-sighted eyes, whp taught music,&#xD;
wore spectacles, ate sour-kraut, and played&#xD;
like Liszt. There was a vivacious French.&#xD;
woman, a cousin of the principal, with the sal-&#xD;
lowest shin and blackest eyes in all Jamaica,&#xD;
with a love of toilets next to insanity, and a&#xD;
talent for arranging them next to naaculous,&#xD;
And, finally, there was a young American from&#xD;
the State of Georgia, a stately, handsome girl&#xD;
who had been in the school only one session,&#xD;
who talked very little about herself, but who&#xD;
bore the stamp of gentle blood and gentle&#xD;
&#xD;
~HERE are few people who have attained&#xD;
any moderate length of years, and pos-&#xD;
sess in any moderate degree the higher sensi-&#xD;
bilities and deeper passions, which are by no&#xD;
means the common heritage of the common&#xD;
race, who do not feel and will not acknowledge&#xD;
that existence is far from being synonymous&#xD;
with life. The former state begins at birth&#xD;
and ends at death, extending over many a&#xD;
level of stagnant days, including all the slug-&#xD;
gish periods of inaction, and all the weary in-&#xD;
tervals of dead calm, as well as the stirring&#xD;
breezes and the blinding storms that come to&#xD;
the mental as to the physical world. The lat-&#xD;
ter is thronged with action, filled to the brim&#xD;
with keen emotions, and whetted with eager&#xD;
strife, burning with passion, abounding in vi'-&#xD;
tality, and freighted with issues that in result,&#xD;
at least, extend .beyond the earth we tread.&#xD;
Sometimes these two states of being go hand&#xD;
in hand through man's pilgrimage. But this '&#xD;
is rare. Few people live always ; the vast&#xD;
majority live but seldom; and there are many&#xD;
who, from birth to death, never live at all'&#xD;
The woman whose name stands at the head&#xD;
of this story, belonged to the second class.&#xD;
Once, for a brief space, her pulse changed&#xD;
from the dull, even beat of existence, to the&#xD;
full, quick throb of life ; onceonly-&#xD;
."All thoughts, ali passions, all delights,&#xD;
Whatever stirs this mortal frame," ,&#xD;
waked within her, and, sweeping into one&#xD;
great current, roused her soul to the very cen-&#xD;
tre, stirring it, filling it, teaching it the lesson&#xD;
which is old as time, yet which every new-bo~m&#xD;
child of Time must leais for itself-,-the lesson&#xD;
that delight is twin-born with pain, and that&#xD;
to live is to suffer.&#xD;

rearing, and whose name was Powell Var&#xD;
dray.&#xD;
It was near sunset on the third day aftei&#xD;
the school had formally closed, that the latte,&#xD;
was alone' in one of the large dormitories&#xD;
through which at this hour the first welcome&#xD;
breath of the land-breeze began to sweep,&#xD;
She had spent the long, sultry afternoon thert&#xD;
'-the afternoon which in the tropics has more&#xD;
than the stillness of our midnight-and now&#xD;
that various sounds proved that the universal&#xD;
trance of sie8ta was at last broken, she left&#xD;
unfinished a letter which she had been writing,&#xD;
and went to ~ne of the windows. As she&#xD;
leaned out, the day-god sank into the distant&#xD;
* occa; and almost immediately the city below&#xD;
her waked into life. Windows that had been&#xD;
barred against the fierce rays of a vertical sun,&#xD;
opened wide 'at the first stirring of the breeze&#xD;
among the plumy leaves without; streets that&#xD;
had been deserted by all save a few lounging&#xD;
negroes and busy laborers began to be filled&#xD;
with carriages and pedestrians; sounds of&#xD;
passing feet, hum of voices, laughter and&#xD;
strains of distant song, floated up to the young&#xD;
foreigner; and, from the shade that came over&#xD;
her face, it seemed as if these things had more&#xD;
power to sadden than to cheer. Even the&#xD;
peneionnst at last roused in some degree. She&#xD;
heard the chatter of voices as the French&#xD;
teacher and two or three girls asSembled on&#xD;
the flat roof over her head; and from below&#xD;
there came the notes of a piano which resolved&#xD;
~into the strange, wild beauty of "Walpurgis&#xD;
Night" as the German teacher found that she&#xD;
had the grand salon all to herself. The royal&#xD;
harmonies were rising fuller and fuller on the&#xD;
dying day, when suddenly there came a clatter&#xD;
of horses' hoofs down the quiet street, a flush&#xD;
that even the twilight could not hide on Powell&#xD;
Vardray's face; and a gallant-looking rider&#xD;
who swept by at a sharp canter. In passing&#xD;
the school, he reined in his horse a little, and&#xD;
looked eagerly upward. The eyes above were&#xD;
looking dQwn--frank, tender eyes that had no&#xD;
"cunning to be strange" in their soft depths-.&#xD;
and the two glances crossed like swords. It&#xD;
was only momentary. The cavalier smiled,&#xD;
uncovered his head, bent low, and then was&#xD;
gone. The gb-I drew back with the flush al.&#xD;
ready faded from her cheek; and when, a mo-&#xD;
ment l~ter, her name was called by a servant&#xD;
near b~', sh~ turned and spoke in the quiet,&#xD;
harmonious voice known so well in the school.&#xD;
"'Here I am, Rose. What is it?,'&#xD;
&#xD;
ARDRAY'S LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"A note for you, ma'am," said the servant,&#xD;
presenting, as she spoke, a dainty white mis-&#xD;
sive as if it had been a bayonet. "The mes-&#xD;
senger is waiting, ma'am," she added, after a&#xD;
minute, as the young teacher sat with the en-&#xD;
velope unopened in her hand, her brow slightly&#xD;
bent, and a faint reflection of the flush that&#xD;
was gone rising in her cheek.&#xD;
"Yes--I know," she said, with a start.&#xD;
Then she broke the seal, drew forth the en-&#xD;
closure, leaned forward, and, by the last light&#xD;
of day, read these lines:&#xD;
"Dn&amp;amp;n Miss VAnruaAv: We leave Kings.&#xD;
ton to-morrow for our residence in the hill.&#xD;
country. Knowing how unpleasant the city is&#xD;
at this time of year, and how lonely you must&#xD;
be in the school, we shall be delighted if you&#xD;
will accompany us and spend your vacation&#xD;
there. Alicia, in particular, is very anxious&#xD;
that you should do so; and I hope sincerely&#xD;
that you will not disappoint her by a refusal.&#xD;
If you say yes, I will call for you at nine&#xD;
o'clock to-morrow morning.&#xD;
"Yours truly,       E. M. Muaa&amp;amp;v."&#xD;
Miss Vardray read this brief epistle twice&#xD;
over; then she knitted her brows again, and&#xD;
gave a moment to reflection; then she smiled&#xD;
slightly, and finally she looked up and spoke.&#xD;
"You may go, Rose, and I will bring' the&#xD;
answer down myself. Be sure and make the&#xD;
messenger wait for it, though. Where is&#xD;
madame?~~&#xD;
"In her own room, ma'am. She is going&#xD;
out, I think, for she was dressing when I came&#xD;
up."&#xD;
"Going out! Then I must see her at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
With the note in her hand, she left the&#xD;
dormitory, ran down a flight of stairs to the&#xD;
second floor, followed a corridor, and came to&#xD;
that part of the building where the private&#xD;
apartments of Madame Girod, the principal,&#xD;
were situated. Here she knocked, and was at&#xD;
once admitted to the chamber where this au-&#xD;
gust personage - a handsome and decidedly&#xD;
sallow specimen of the 1'arisienne-was en-&#xD;
gaged in the mysteries of the toilet. She gave&#xD;
a cordial greeting to the young girl, and, when&#xD;
the nature of her errand was explained, she&#xD;
smiled benign consent.&#xD;
"There are no better people in Jamaica&#xD;
than the Murrays," said she, approvingly.&#xD;
"They are at the head of fashion, and live in&#xD;
&#xD;
POWELL VARDRAY'S TAPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
129&#xD;
&#xD;
most elegant style. Of course, c7i~'-e arnie, you&#xD;
must go. We shall miss you immeasurably,&#xD;
and I am sure I shall die of that stupid Ma-&#xD;
dame Schaffer, and' that chatterbox of a Vie-&#xD;
tome, but still I dare not be so selfish as to&#xD;
keep you. Be sure and present my affection-&#xD;
ate remembrances to Alicia-she was always&#xD;
my favorite pupil, you know. Bon soir, ma&#xD;
belle. Go and enjoy yourself."&#xD;
Dismissed in this hasty and. benedictory&#xD;
fashion, Miss Vardray went to her room, and&#xD;
wrote an affirmative reply to Mrs. Murray's in-&#xD;
vitation. After this reply was sent, and while&#xD;
a loud bell was summoning her to the light&#xD;
evening meal, she stopped and asked herself&#xD;
if she had done wisely. These Murrays&#xD;
chanced to be friends of her family, and when&#xD;
she came to Jamaica to enter as teacher the&#xD;
school where Alicia Murray was a pupil, they&#xD;
had had the grace to pay her some faint show&#xD;
of social attention. She had been invited to&#xD;
several of their entertainments, and at one of&#xD;
these had the good or bad fortune to ~aeet a&#xD;
certain Captain Romeyne, of' the governor's&#xD;
staff who, being much attracted by her beau-&#xD;
ty, had devoted himself to her with more&#xD;
einps-essement than was at all expedient. After&#xD;
that she had never received another invitation&#xD;
to the Murray house. Alicia, however, who&#xD;
was a frank school-girl not yet broken into&#xD;
the traces of social life, and very fond of her&#xD;
teacher, carelessly betrayed the secret of this&#xD;
sudden reserve. Despite their wealth and&#xD;
fashion, the Murrays, it seemed, had ~not been&#xD;
very fortunate in matrimonial disposal of their&#xD;
daughters-partly owing to the fact that in&#xD;
the West Indies, as in a good many other&#xD;
places, eligible suitors are scarce, and young&#xD;
ladies are plenty. The eldest daughter had&#xD;
married a planter of Trinidad, who, in five&#xD;
years, gambled away his fortune, drank him-&#xD;
self to death, and returned his wife on her&#xD;
father's hands a penniless widOw. The second&#xD;
daughter was, in a moderate way, a beauty,&#xD;
and flew therefore at higher game than any&#xD;
the islands in themselves could furnish. Learn.&#xD;
ing that Captain Romeyne might, by the death&#xD;
of a sickly elderbrother, become the heir of one&#xD;
of the largest fortunes and oldest titles 'among&#xD;
the baronetcies of Great Britain, the Murray&#xD;
family in general, and Miss Ellinor Murray in&#xD;
particular, had made hin the object of much&#xD;
attention and the centre of many hopes. There&#xD;
had been no vulgar matrimonial scheming-.&#xD;
they were both too wise and too well-bred for&#xD;
&#xD;
I that-but there had been a good de~lof finesse&#xD;
and really creditable intrigue which proved&#xD;
its ability by its success. Sfep by step the&#xD;
young man was led on until there is little&#xD;
doubt but that the object in view might readily&#xD;
have been compassed, if the fair face and dark&#xD;
eyes of Powell Vardray had not crossed his&#xD;
path, and dashed at once into insignificance&#xD;
the commonplace beauty he had admired be-&#xD;
fore. And as Powell Vardmay stood before&#xD;
her mirror now, looking at this face, and gaz-&#xD;
ing into the depths of those eyes, she asked&#xD;
herself what this invitation meant. Had they&#xD;
given up the pursuit as hopeless, and were&#xD;
they willing that she should taste one, short&#xD;
draught of happiness? Young as she was,&#xD;
the girl was worldly wise enough to return a&#xD;
negative to this question. Did it mean some&#xD;
plan to draw her out of his way, or to place&#xD;
her before him in some unfavorable light?&#xD;
Again she bent her brows, and again the ques-&#xD;
tion was too deep for her. At last she shook&#xD;
her head. "I cannot tell," she said alond;&#xD;
"but wkntever it be, I am ready to face It. I&#xD;
am no child, to fall into an open trap. I think&#xD;
my wit is as quick as theirs; 'and if strife&#xD;
must come, it shall be strife d l'outrance. Let&#xD;
them mean what they will, this is my only&#xD;
road to happiness, and I shall take it. They&#xD;
cannot harm him, and for me-I am not rich&#xD;
enough in any gift of earth to fear for myself.&#xD;
The destitute can afford to be brave. I will&#xD;
go."&#xD;
Years afterward Powell Vardray thought&#xD;
of these reckless words, and looked back on&#xD;
this resolve as the turning-point of her life.&#xD;
Whether she ever regretted itj was known&#xD;
only to herself and God; but it is hardly&#xD;
probable that she ever did-it is more than&#xD;
probable that she held the purchase of.one&#xD;
brief taste of life none too dearly made even&#xD;
at the price she was forced to p~ty for it.&#xD;
Punctually at nine o'clock the next morn-&#xD;
ing, a carriage, well known in Kingston, drove&#xD;
up to Madame Girod's door~ a brown-eyed girl&#xD;
sprang out, rushed past the fortress sans cere-&#xD;
rnorzie, fled up-stairs with the careless ease of&#xD;
one who treads familiar ground, and burst into&#xD;
Miss Vardray's room like an electric flash.&#xD;
"Alicia l--how you startled met" said the&#xD;
teacher, with a laugh; and more than that&#xD;
she could not say, for Alicia's arms were&#xD;
around her, precluding speech, and almost&#xD;
threatening suffocation.&#xD;
"Oh, lam so glad you are going with usi"&#xD;

so slightly that the careless girl beside her *Miss Vardray ceased to regret her change of&#xD;

&#xD;
131-&#xD;
&#xD;
visits from plantation to plantation, made u&#xD;
the sum of daily life for these gay daughter&#xD;
of the tropics; and into this she was drawl&#xD;
almost without a protest. She had come t&#xD;
be happy-she ended by being gay; and, oh&#xD;
what a wide distance there is between th&#xD;
two! After a while, she began to be grateful&#xD;
to the Murrays, and to think that they ha&#xD;
simply been glad to give her this pleasure~&#xD;
without incurring any risk to themselves there&#xD;
by. But her heart beat sorely whenever sin&#xD;
thought of the man who had gone away with&#xD;
out one word of farewell-gone just when h(&#xD;
might have known that her brief period of&#xD;
freedom had come. Still, she laughed, an~&#xD;
sang, and danced, and did all things so charm&#xD;
ingly, that she fascinated women as well a:&#xD;
men, old as well as young, with whom she&#xD;
came in contact. She made quite a furor:&#xD;
during her short season of questionable en-&#xD;
joyment. People forgot to patronize her with&#xD;
the condescending patronage which was due&#xD;
her social position. They even forgot this so-&#xD;
cial position altogether, and, only recognizing&#xD;
the native nobility stamped upon the woman,&#xD;
the grace of person, and the gifts of mind&#xD;
that made so fair a hold, grounded arms in a&#xD;
salute more valuable because unconscious.&#xD;
Suddenly, however, into the midst of this&#xD;
there came a jar. Suddenly Powell waked to&#xD;
the knowledge that all was not so smooth as&#xD;
it appeared, and that, in truth, she was the&#xD;
centre of a scheme, common enough in so.&#xD;
ciety, yet, to some people, none the less re-&#xD;
volting. on that account. Among her many&#xD;
admirers was one whom a little encouragement&#xD;
would soon have transferred into a serious&#xD;
suitor, and this encouragement was given not&#xD;
by herseig but by Mrs. During. The person&#xD;
in question was a young planter of moderately&#xD;
good birth, moderately good fortune, and mod-&#xD;
erately good appearance, who had once been&#xD;
in Ellinor Murray's train, but whose preten-&#xD;
sions were not considered of sufficient im-&#xD;
portance to warrant a formal dismissal, and&#xD;
who was now handed over to the young teach-&#xD;
ci- with an understanding on all sides that it&#xD;
was an admirable thing for her, and a settle-&#xD;
ment in life she would do well to accept. That&#xD;
the girl herself looked at the matter from a&#xD;
different point of view, may have been foolish,&#xD;
but, at least, was not remarkable. In many&#xD;
respects, life had been hard lines to her; but&#xD;
it had never taught her-it never did teach&#xD;
her-that lesson of the world which most&#xD;
&#xD;
p women learn in their cradles, and the alpha&#xD;
s and omega of which is-s husband. Faults,&#xD;
a and to spare, she had; but all of them put to-&#xD;
~ gather did not suffice to make up the sum of&#xD;
L, that one virtue, entitled reasonable prudence,&#xD;
a which, in matters of this kind, the world is&#xD;
.1 never weary of commending. Therefore, when&#xD;
I Mrs. During signified that a word would be&#xD;
enough to place Mr. Covington at her feet, it&#xD;
- would be hard to say whether this eleven lady&#xD;
was most astonished or mortified by the cour-&#xD;
teous but decided repulse which she received.&#xD;
It was so unexpected that she could scarcely&#xD;
contain her chagrin within moderate bounds,&#xD;
I She had laid her plans so well, she had brought&#xD;
- them by esreful degrees to such a successful&#xD;
issue, that now to be foiled like this at the&#xD;
very last was hard-almost too hard to bear.&#xD;
*    "She is either a deeper schemer or a greater&#xD;
fool than I possibly imagined," said this charm-&#xD;
ing lady to her mother. ".1 knew that Arthur&#xD;
Romeyne had been amusing himself with her&#xD;
to a shameful extent, and, of course, I knew&#xD;
also that she was flattering herself with the&#xD;
hope of marrying him; but I never really be.&#xD;
lived that she would carry her game to the&#xD;
length of refusing Covington. And I assured&#xD;
him, too, that his success was certain. What&#xD;
can I say to him now?"&#xD;
"Oh, Covington is not a person of any im~&#xD;
portance," said Mrs. Murray, in a tone of quiet&#xD;
contempt that would have annihilated its ob-&#xD;
ject, if he could have heard it. "You know&#xD;
you can say any thing to him, and dispose of&#xD;
him in any way. The serious matter is, that&#xD;
this girl's refusal looks very badly-looks as&#xD;
if she had some assured ground of hope-to&#xD;
believe-about Captain Romeyne, you know."&#xD;
"It looks as if she were either scheming&#xD;
very deeply, or hoping very absurdly,'~ said&#xD;
Mrs. Dering. "That is what I told you a mo-&#xD;
ment ago. But, as for Captain Romeyne, it&#xD;
proves nothing. Of course, he has been fool-&#xD;
ish; but I have no idea that he has been, or&#xD;
intends to be, any thing mere ~ and' it takes&#xD;
little or nothing to set an adventuress of this&#xD;
kind to castle-building~"&#xD;
"We must get rid of her, though, Maud.,&#xD;
It was against my wishes that she was invited;&#xD;
but you were so sure that she could be dig-.&#xD;
posed of in this way. Now, you see how right.&#xD;
I was; and Captain Romeyne may come back&#xD;
any day-and find her here."&#xD;
"I see that I have failed in my plan," said&#xD;
Mrs. During, coolly; "but~ at least, I have:&#xD;

were before-.nq better, certainly; but no&#xD;
worse, either."&#xD;
"I don't see how you can say that, when&#xD;
the girl is still here. I don't like it, Maud. I&#xD;
honestly confess that it makes me uneasy, and&#xD;
I don't like it."&#xD;
"I don't like it, either, mamma; but we&#xD;

In the course of the next twelve hours,&#xD;
Mrs. During had cause to alter this opinion,&#xD;
and to lay up, for future consideration, the im-&#xD;
portant lesson that a policy of procrastination&#xD;
is always a policy of loss. That evening a&#xD;
large party dined at Flamstead-..the name of&#xD;
the Murray scat-and, after dinner~ Powell&#xD;
was called to the piano. She sang more than&#xD;
ordinarily well, for she had a fresh, fiexile&#xD;
voice, of excellent training and great expres-&#xD;
sion; so, after a whi1e~ by special request, she&#xD;
gave the "Adelaide" of Beethoven. Although&#xD;
she never sang it afterward, the tender, pas..&#xD;
sionful strain seemed sometimes breathed into&#xD;
her ear by unseen lips, an4 they always brought&#xD;
back, like a vivid picture, the memory of&#xD;
that scene-the brilliant room with its gayly-&#xD;
dressed groups, the broad windows open to&#xD;
the fragrant tropical night, and the luminous&#xD;
tropical heavens, the faces at her side, and the&#xD;
very scent of the flowers drooping in her hair.&#xD;
Suddenly, the golden tide of melody wavered&#xD;
and almost stopped; suddenly, a sharp dis-&#xD;
cord came into the sweet tone-idyl, and sud-&#xD;
denly, also, a wave of color swept over the&#xD;
singer's face, as a tall, handsome man entered&#xD;
the room, and, despite the "Adelaide," was&#xD;
greeted by a chorus of welcome. ~&#xD;
"Why, Captain Romeyne, is this you?"&#xD;
"What an unexpected pleasure!"&#xD;
"My dear fellow, where did you drop&#xD;
from?"&#xD;
"Captain Bomeyne, this is charming-and&#xD;
all the more charming because such a sur-&#xD;
prise. We thought you far enough away."&#xD;
It was Mrs. During who came forward with&#xD;
an impulsive rush, and said this. It was with&#xD;
her that 4laptain Ilomeyne first shook hands,&#xD;
and to her made an explanation of his un-&#xD;
expected appearance. Powell did not hear&#xD;
him; but she learned afterward that, having&#xD;

POWELL VARDRAY'S LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
chanced upon some nautical misfortune, the&#xD;
yacht had been obliged to put back into&#xD;
Kingston for repairs, and ~that, without giving&#xD;
warning of his intention, he had ridden out to&#xD;
Flamatead, and so surprised them.&#xD;
"Mamma will be delighted," said Mrs.&#xD;
During, taking his arm. "She was talking of&#xD;
you only to-day. Come and let me give her a&#xD;
pleasant surprise. As for Ellinor-but then I&#xD;
must not tell tales out of, school, and her first&#xD;
look will be apt to assure you whether or not&#xD;
she is glad to see you. We have quite a&#xD;
charming party here, and we mean to make&#xD;
you prisoner, now that you are in our hands.&#xD;
-." Mr. Latimer, do you know where my sister&#xD;
is ?-Why, Mr. Covington, I am surprised that&#xD;
you are not at your usual devotions!"&#xD;
Mr. Covington was quick enough to follow&#xD;
her glance, and move at once toward Miss&#xD;
Vardray. Observing the direction of his steps,&#xD;
Captain Romeyne first looked surprised, and&#xD;
then laughed.&#xD;
"So Covington has found a new shrine!"&#xD;
said helightly. "I hope Miss Murray did&#xD;
not prove very cruel?"&#xD;
"Oh I it is merely a case of mutual ac-&#xD;
commodation," answered Mrs. During, with a&#xD;
shrug. "Ellinor really likes the poor fellow,&#xD;
auti, having the kindest heart in the world,&#xD;
she was very glad to dispose of him by hand.&#xD;
ing him over to this girl-one of Alicia's&#xD;
teachers, whom mamma invited here to please&#xD;
the child, and who, of course, is delighted with&#xD;
such an establishment as Mr. Covington offers&#xD;
her."&#xD;
Captain Romeyne's eyes-and very keen&#xD;
ones they were-followed Mr. Covington, and&#xD;
rested for a moment on Powell, over whom&#xD;
the gentleman was just then bending.&#xD;
"She does not look delighted," said he, as&#xD;
he saw the girl turn almost haughtily from&#xD;
some speech of her admirer's.&#xD;
"Women's looks are very deceptive," an-&#xD;
swered Mrs. During, with a glance of feigned&#xD;
indifference and real vexation in that direc-&#xD;
tion. "Perhaps she thinks she can play with&#xD;
her fish, having safely landed him. Of course,&#xD;
the subject cannot interest you; but it is an&#xD;
understood thing that they are engaged. Here&#xD;
is mamma now.-Mamma, look what a charm.&#xD;
lag surprise I have brought you-Captain Re-&#xD;
meyne in person!"&#xD;
How wearily, after this, the hours went by&#xD;
to Powell! He was there in the room with&#xD;
her; but oceans and mountains might have&#xD;
&#xD;
133&#xD;
&#xD;
intervened, for nll the satisfaction that his&#xD;
presence gave. He was monopolized by the&#xD;
Murrays; she was guarded zealously by Mr.&#xD;
Covington; and even glances were forbidden,&#xD;
since glances, unfortunately, are as intelligible&#xD;
as words even to bystanders. It was life that&#xD;
throbbed in the girl's feverish pulses-but&#xD;
such bitter life that just then she would will-&#xD;
ingly have taken instead the dead calm and&#xD;
stagnant quiet that, unstirred by joy, is also&#xD;
untroubled by pain. Unfortunately, however~&#xD;
the choice between these two states is never&#xD;
granted us. Without intermission, the strain&#xD;
went on, until at last the effort to talk easily&#xD;
and laugh gayly became more than she could&#xD;
bear. Then she seized a favorable opportuni-&#xD;
ty-a moment when no one was observing&#xD;
her-and, stepping through an open window,&#xD;
slipped away into the friendly shadow of the&#xD;
night. Once outside, she did not linger in&#xD;
the neighborhood of the drawing.room, but&#xD;
took her way to the farther extremity of the&#xD;
grounds, where an abrupt height overlooked&#xD;
the sleeping ocean-a lonely spot, where the&#xD;
only sound which broke the silence was a&#xD;
monotone of surf on the beach far below.&#xD;
There she knelt down, and laid her cheek on&#xD;
the cold stone of a balustrade that guarded&#xD;
the dangerous descent. The holy and inbifa-&#xD;
ble .peace of Nature soothed her as nothing&#xD;
else could have done. The great mother&#xD;
seemed stretching soft arms of love around&#xD;
her, and sending sweet messages, in every&#xD;
breath of odorous air and every echo of the&#xD;
waves below. By degrees, a sort of lethargy&#xD;
crept over her. How long it lasted, she had&#xD;
no means of knowing. It was broken, at last,&#xD;
by a step on the gravel walk, a presence at&#xD;
her side, and a voice she knew only too well,&#xD;
Raying:&#xD;
"How devout you look! Have you stolen&#xD;
away here to say your prayers  "'&#xD;
She glanced up without changing her atti-&#xD;
tude, looking rarely lovely in the silver star.&#xD;
light.&#xD;
"I came away for quiet," she said. "Is&#xD;
that very strange 1' No; I have not been say-&#xD;
ing anyprayers-unless they were to the ocean."&#xD;
"Anddidithearyou?"&#xD;
"Yes, 'in a degree. I h~ve been very&#xD;
much at rest for a time."&#xD;
"So you came here for rest?"&#xD;
"I thought I told you that a moment ago.&#xD;
Quiet and rest are ~ynonymous terms-are&#xD;
they not?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Hardly, I think. There is~a difference&#xD;
between them; but-well, I did not follow&#xD;
you to split hairs over verbal distinctions.&#xD;
Look at me again, please. I want to see&#xD;
your eyes, while I ask you a question. There&#xD;
-that is it. Steady now! don't start if I am&#xD;
outrageously impertinent. Tell me-are you&#xD;
engaged to Covington?"&#xD;
He spoke quickly, almost sharply-spoke&#xD;
as if suspense irked him, and yet a~ if he&#xD;
feared to end it-but the astonishment that&#xD;
sprang at once into her eyes answered him&#xD;
without any need of words. He first smiled,&#xD;
then laughed, at her look of blank amaze-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"I am satisfied," he said; "don't trouble&#xD;
yourself to speak; your face has done that&#xD;
for you. I was a fool to believe it for a mo-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
"You believed that I was engaged to Mr.&#xD;
Covington? Alit I can guess-Mrs. Dering&#xD;
told you so."&#xD;
"And if she did?"&#xD;
"Then she might have told you, also, that&#xD;
it is no fault of hers I am not, that she did&#xD;
her utmost to draw me into an engagement,&#xD;
and that it was plainly for this purpose that I&#xD;
was invited here."&#xD;
Rorneyne started slightly, then recovered&#xD;
himself and laughed again.&#xD;
"Was it, indeed? Well, it matters very&#xD;
little about the purpose. The result is that&#xD;
we are once more face to face, as I almost&#xD;
feared we never should be again. This is&#xD;
enough for me. Powell, is it not enough for&#xD;
you also?"&#xD;
His gay, careless tones softened over the&#xD;
last words, and the girl beside him quivered&#xD;
from head to foot. She knew that the crown-&#xD;
ing issue of her life had come; yet through&#xD;
the midst of her sudden joy there pulsated&#xD;
one sharp throb of pain. She could not seize&#xD;
or analyze it, for in a second it was gone; but&#xD;
she remembered it afterward, and wondered&#xD;
if it had been a premonition. She did not&#xD;
speak, though Romeyne waited for her answer,&#xD;
and in That moment the very voices of the&#xD;
night seemed hushed, as if listeniiig for her&#xD;
rcply-only far below were beard the soft ins-&#xD;
tling of the stately palms -and the murmur of&#xD;
the tide upon the beach. Then the young&#xD;
man knelt down beside her, and bent his face&#xD;
to a level with her own,&#xD;
"Powell," he said, "have I vexed you?&#xD;
Will you not even speak to me? It is true&#xD;

heads. After that they saw no more of their&#xD;

tain-range were crowned with plumy sentinels&#xD;
and girdled with a wealth of foliage, while&#xD;
heavy palms drooped over their heads, and&#xD;
the rocks and glades about them were enam-&#xD;
elled with a thousand shrubs, each of which,&#xD;
in less favored climes, would have been a rare&#xD;
exotic. Everywhere opened the broad, suc-&#xD;
culent leaves that abound in the tropics;&#xD;
everywhere shone the golden and crimson&#xD;
glories for which botany has no name; and&#xD;
through the deep green of a jungle on one&#xD;
side was caught~ the sheen of flashing water,&#xD;
as a swift mountain-stream leaped down a&#xD;
height of some eighty feet into a rocky bed&#xD;
below, and sent up a shower of spray like a&#xD;
silver mist. The whole was so heavenly that,&#xD;
when they paused, Powell scarcely noticed the&#xD;
gravity of her companion's face, or his anx-&#xD;
ious look around him. She was drinking in a&#xD;
deep draught of the beauty lavished before&#xD;
her, when he spoke:&#xD;
"I am very much afraid that we have lost&#xD;
our way. This is no road at all that we have&#xD;
been following, and I really have very little&#xD;
idea of our bearings."&#xD;
"We shall have to turn back, I suppose,"&#xD;
said she, carelessly. "It is a pity, for we shall&#xD;
be late in reaching Flamatead. We can turn&#xD;
back-can we not? " she added, with a sudden&#xD;
accession of interest and concern, caused by a&#xD;
glance at Romeyne's face.&#xD;
"I-am not sure of it," said he, slowly,&#xD;
as, turning in his saddle, he looked in the di-&#xD;
rection from which they had come. "I am&#xD;
afraid that, if we do turn back, we shall not&#xD;
be able to reach the road," he went on.&#xD;
"Unfortunately, I hardly noticed the way at&#xD;
all, and there are no landmarks in my memory.&#xD;
The scenery is so much alike that we may&#xD;
have wandered Heaven only knows how far."&#xD;
"What are we to do-keep straight on?"&#xD;
"I dare not do that, with the night so near&#xD;
at hand."&#xD;
"Where is the middle course, then? We&#xD;
cannot stand here until daylight."&#xD;
"No-not if we can help it. Will you&#xD;
hold my horse a minute? Perhaps, if I climb&#xD;
that hill yonder, I may see something to guide&#xD;
us."&#xD;
He dismounted as he spoke, and, bringing&#xD;
up his horse, gave her the rein. As she took&#xD;
it she could not forbear urging him to haste,&#xD;
for she had been long enough in the tropics&#xD;
to know that the suxi would sink in a few min-&#xD;
utes, and that darkness would almost instant-&#xD;

the Luxuriant undergrowth, dashing over the&#xD;
torrent, and springing up the precipice down&#xD;
which the cascade tumbled. Soon she lost&#xD;
sight of him; but she could hear his voice&#xD;
when he spoke, and now and then a large&#xD;
stone fell crashing along the hill, making her&#xD;
tremble for his safety. Suddenly the sun&#xD;
went down, sinking like a shot into the dis-&#xD;
tant expanse of ocean, and, simultaneously,&#xD;
the fan-like foliage began to stir with the&#xD;
breath of the land-breeze, while a chorus of&#xD;
insect voices made all Nature animate with&#xD;
their rejoicing. At this moment, Powell heard&#xD;
a shout that made her look eagerly upward.&#xD;
She saw Romeyne on a point of rock far above&#xD;
her head; but he was dwarfed to almost pig.&#xD;
my dimensions, and his voice, as it floated&#xD;
down, sounded strangely distant.&#xD;
"I can see nothing," he said-" nothing&#xD;
but the mountains and the sea. I fancy that&#xD;
Flamstead is in that direction" (he pointed&#xD;
southeast), "but I cannot tell, and the co~n-&#xD;
try is too broken for sight."&#xD;
"But is there no other house to be seen?"&#xD;
Powell asked, anxiously, for the situation be-&#xD;
gan to break upon her in a far from pleas.&#xD;

He looked round in every direction, using&#xD;
his hand as telescope, then answered, slowly:&#xD;
"None."&#xD;
"Do you see any road?"&#xD;
"Not even a path."&#xD;
"Oh, what shall we do?"&#xD;
"We must keep up our spirits, in the first&#xD;
place, and, if necessary, we must bivouac out&#xD;
all night, in the second. Would you be afraid&#xD;
to do that?"&#xD;
"I should prefer to go back to Flam'stead."&#xD;
"AhI so would I. Well, it is growing&#xD;
dark, and I may be some time in reaching&#xD;
you-so I had better come down. I think I&#xD;
see a way out of our difficulty. I recognize a&#xD;
landmark over yonder, and, if we can only keep&#xD;
straight and reach it, we shall be all right in&#xD;
an hour or two."&#xD;
"Do you mean to come down where you&#xD;
went up?"&#xD;
"Necessarily-since that is the only prac-&#xD;
ticable point of descent. It is confoundedly&#xD;
slippery, too. I only hope I shan't break my&#xD;
neck-that would be unpleasant for you."&#xD;
"Don't talk so heedlessly; and pray take&#xD;

"Can you see me?"&#xD;
"Yes, quite plainly."&#xD;
"Kiss your hand to me, then; and now-&#xD;
He waved his own hand gayly, and then&#xD;
swung himself over a point of rock. After&#xD;
this, Powell could not see him any longer.&#xD;
The luxuriant foliage hid him from her sight,&#xD;
and, though she strained her eyes to pierce&#xD;
through the dusk, it was impossible to follow&#xD;
his movements. Then the horses grew restive,&#xD;
and she had some trouble in quieting them.&#xD;
Before she entirely succeeded in this, there&#xD;
came a sound that chilled her blood-a sharp&#xD;
exclamation, an ominous crashing of a heavy&#xD;
body through the dense undergrowth, a dull&#xD;
fall, a deep groan, and then an awful silence.&#xD;
For a moment the girl sat stricken, with&#xD;
horror, then she raised her voice and called&#xD;
Romeyne's name but no answer was returned.&#xD;
She waited a moment and called again-still&#xD;
no answer. Then she sprang from her saddle,&#xD;
left the horses to go where they would, and,&#xD;
plunging recklessly into the thicket, made her&#xD;
way to the spot where he had ascended. It&#xD;
took her some time to do tl~is, for her long&#xD;
habit was much in her way, and the water.&#xD;
course intei~vened; but on she went, recklessly,&#xD;
through the prickly shrubs, over the foaming&#xD;
cataract, forward despite all obstacles, despite&#xD;
her torn dress and bleeding hands, until at&#xD;
last she reached her point of destination-the&#xD;
foot of the hill. Then she paused, and gazed&#xD;
earnestly around. Even at noonday, the spot&#xD;
where she stood was dim and dark with the&#xD;
shade of overhanging trees; now, In the dtzsky&#xD;
gloaming, the shadows that gathered there&#xD;
were almost unfathomable. Still, after a mo-&#xD;
ment, her eyes grew accustomed to the dark.&#xD;
ness, and she could distinguish, in form at&#xD;
least, the objects surrounding her. On one&#xD;
side was the silvery sheen of the water-fall; on&#xD;
the other, a gigantic banana rose like a senti.&#xD;
nel over the heads of the lesser trees, and flung&#xD;
its broad leaves against the treacherous rocks&#xD;
of the steep ascent. The trunk of this tree&#xD;
was not three feet from the cascade, and, as&#xD;
Powell stood beside it, a spray of the falling&#xD;
Water came like rain in her face. Once again&#xD;
she called, and now a faint groan answered 1&#xD;
her. Guided by this, she sprang forward, and&#xD;
in a moment was kneeling bya prostrate figure&#xD;
that lay on the verge of the stream, half in,&#xD;
half out of, the foaming water. The silent&#xD;
depths of forest echoed with weird distinctness&#xD;
&#xD;
RDRAY'S LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
the wailing sound that broke from her lips as&#xD;
she bent down and lifted in her arms that&#xD;
stricken head.&#xD;
"My love! my love!" she cried, in tones&#xD;
that might have waked the dead, "can you not&#xD;
speak to me? My God! are you killed?"&#xD;
No sound answered her, not even a groan.&#xD;
The head which she supported fell heavily&#xD;
over her arm, and the strong young form lay&#xD;
helpless and motionless with the leaden weight&#xD;
of insensibility. After a moment, she bent&#xD;
down and laid her ear over his heart. At first&#xD;
she could not tell whether it beat, but grad-&#xD;
ually she caught the slow, deep throbs, and&#xD;
knew that life still held the citadel. That&#xD;
knowledge was like an elixir of vitality to her,&#xD;
and seemed to fill her with a strength and&#xD;
energy that must have been lent from Heaven&#xD;
for the time. She strove to draw him up from&#xD;
the water; but the first movement brought&#xD;
forth such a moan of pain that she was obliged&#xD;
to desist from this attempt. Then she looked&#xD;
round; cordial there was none, but Nature's&#xD;
great restorative was near tt hand, and she&#xD;
sprinkled his face with water until it was evi-&#xD;
dent that he would revive. When this was&#xD;
apparent, a thought suddenly struck her, and&#xD;
she plunged her hand into his pockets, search.&#xD;
ing for what she found at last-a small flask,&#xD;
containing French brandy. She first tasted&#xD;
this, then held it to his lips, and poured a&#xD;
slender stream down his throat. In an in-&#xD;
stant, the effeef was visible. He~drew a deep,&#xD;
gurgling breath, opened his eyes, strove to&#xD;
raise himself; fell back with a sharp cry of&#xD;
pain, and lay still for a moment, panting&#xD;
heavily. After a while, he said, slowly:&#xD;
"Powell, are you there? are you near&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"I am here, my love, my poor darling,"&#xD;
said the girl, whose arms were round him, and&#xD;
whose sobs were choking her, as she kept&#xD;
them back, and strove to answer calmly.&#xD;
"How did you "-a pause and a gasp-&#xD;
"reach ~&#xD;
"I don't know. I heard you fall, and I&#xD;
came - that is all. Are you much hurt?&#xD;
Oh! do you think you are much hurt?"&#xD;
"I cannot tell. Wait a moment-let me&#xD;
Lift myself and see. Sweetheart, held my&#xD;
~houlders-help to raise me if you can, There&#xD;
-now-O my God l"&#xD;
It was no mere exclamation, this last, no&#xD;
nere utterance of an ordinary appeal, but a&#xD;
soul's great shuddering cry ever an agony too&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
great for endurance. After it there followed&#xD;
stillness, and Powell knew that he had fainted&#xD;
She did not faint herself, she did net eve:&#xD;
shed a tear. Indeed, in that moment sh&#xD;
proved the heroic nature of her love, by th&#xD;
strength it gave her above her own weakness&#xD;
She knelt by hiu, chafing his hands, bathing&#xD;
his face, pouring brandy as well as she coub&#xD;
between his clinched teeth, and striving, b~&#xD;
every means in her power, to revive him: bu&#xD;
no sound came from her lips, no throb of he&#xD;
anguish found outward expression. Once only&#xD;
she paused and looked upward. Through tin&#xD;
drooping, plume-like foliage, the brilliant con&#xD;
stellations of the southern heaven gazed down&#xD;
shedding their mellow splendor even into thb&#xD;
dark spot, and shimmering fitfully over tin&#xD;
silver cascade. Save the rush of water, al&#xD;
around was full of the strange awe and silenc&#xD;
of the night-that silence in which we seem t&#xD;
hear the great heart of Nature deeply beating.&#xD;
Sounds there were, but they could scarcely in&#xD;
analyzed or described-distant fitful voices of&#xD;
the forest that deepened rather than lessened&#xD;
the significance of the solitude. Powell felt&#xD;
that she was utterly alone-alone with none&#xD;
but God to aid-and out of the very despera-&#xD;
tion of despair came courage. The great soul&#xD;
rose up bravely to face the exigence, and after&#xD;
that she never faltered, even to the end.&#xD;
At last Romeyne slowly came back to con.&#xD;
sciousness, and once more opened his eyes&#xD;
into those that, full of wistful pain, gazed so&#xD;
tenderly upon him.&#xD;
"Sweetheart," he said, faintly, "bend&#xD;
down."&#xD;
She bent down, and he kissed her thrice&#xD;
as passionately, but more softly, than he had&#xD;
kissed her hand the night before. Then he&#xD;
told her to lay his head gently on the ground.&#xD;
"Why?'~ she asked, much pained at this.&#xD;
"Why should I not hold it?"&#xD;
"Because you must go back to Flamstead,"&#xD;
he answered. "When I was up there "-he&#xD;
glanced to the hill over his head-" I saw&#xD;
what our best path would be, and I think&#xD;
there is light enough for you to follow it. I&#xD;
cannot move. You must leave me here, nnd&#xD;
send for me. Listen now, and let me tell you&#xD;
the route-"&#xD;
But she would not listen-she cried out at&#xD;
once on the cruelty of this.&#xD;
"I will not go,'~ she said. "If I could&#xD;
find the way a hundred times over, I would&#xD;
not go. How can you bid me do such a thing?&#xD;
&#xD;

a How can you think I would leave you here&#xD;
L suffering and alone? If I could bring help, it&#xD;
a would be different; but it would require hours&#xD;
o at least, and you all alone-oh, I would die&#xD;
o sooner than go I You are cruel-cruel to try&#xD;
to send me from you like this!"&#xD;
"My darling, it is for-he stopped as he&#xD;
I was about to say "your own sake." He knew&#xD;
~r this was the last argument in the world to move&#xD;
her; so after a moment he added-" it is for&#xD;
L' the best. Do you think it is not happiness to&#xD;
me to know that you are here, to feel your&#xD;
arms around me, and your hand upon me, but&#xD;
-but it must not be. Powell, my own, my&#xD;
own, you must go I"&#xD;
She understood him. She understood how&#xD;
he thought of her even in his great extremity;&#xD;
1 and how, for her own sake, he was willing to&#xD;
send her from him. She knew, too, that he&#xD;
wished to spare her what might be a vigil of&#xD;
death, and in a moment her soul nerved itself&#xD;
* for any endurance.&#xD;
"You are thinking of me," she said, calm.&#xD;
ly, "but there is no need for it. Here-now&#xD;
.~the world is less than clothing to me, and&#xD;
you are all. If I could help you by going, I&#xD;
might force myself to leave you. But there is&#xD;
no question of that. The best help I can&#xD;
render you is to stay by you, and I shall stay.&#xD;
Arthur, my own love, be merciful-let me do&#xD;
it in peace."&#xD;
He smiled faintly. He had said his say,&#xD;
and was too weak to urge her further.&#xD;
"Stay, then," he murmured. "But it will&#xD;
be very, very bitter to you."&#xD;
After this the hours wore slowly oz~-&#xD;
broken only l~y such strong wrestling with&#xD;
pain as would have torn the girl's heart if she&#xD;
had seen the veriest stranger suffer them, yet&#xD;
on which she looked without a murmur. She&#xD;
held the quivering form, wiped the streaming&#xD;
brow, moistened the parched lips, and gave&#xD;
the brandy as he directed-all without a single&#xD;
falter. Then in the intervals, when he could&#xD;
talk faintly and brokenly, she listened and an-&#xD;
swered more like an angel than a woman.&#xD;
Love made her, for the time being, almost&#xD;
divine, endowing her with a strength, a wis-&#xD;
dom, and atenderness, that in herself she&#xD;
could not vlaim. In these few hours of mingled&#xD;
agony and bliss, she lived her life-all that was&#xD;
ever granted her. He ;was dying; the sum-&#xD;
mons had come in the full glory of his man-&#xD;
hood, and he was going, he was almost gone,&#xD;
into that realm of dark shadow where only&#xD;

faith can pierce and love can follow, She&#xD;
knew that, but she also knew that he was all&#xD;
hers-that the world put no claim between&#xD;
them here, that heart was bared to heart at&#xD;
last, and that out of her arms no human power&#xD;
could take him now. They belonged to each&#xD;
other. He had told her that the night before,&#xD;
but the sense of it did not come to her till&#xD;
now-now that he was dying in her arms, all&#xD;
alone in the wild forest. Gradually his mind&#xD;
began to wander, and he talked of an English&#xD;
home that his eyes would never see again.&#xD;
"If I could only have taken you there, my&#xD;
darling," he said, with a sudden return to con-&#xD;
sciousness. "But this may be best. We have&#xD;
tasted all the sweetness of the cup of love, and&#xD;
we are spared any of its bitterness. Bitterness&#xD;
might have come, you know-even to us. I&#xD;
wonder if! am going, Powell? I wonder if it&#xD;
is because I am not myself that I feel so&#xD;
strangely content-so strangely sure that it is&#xD;
all right?"&#xD;
"God only knows, love. God grant that&#xD;
indeed It may be all right-for you 1"&#xD;
"Sweetheart, you won't forget me soon?"&#xD;
"Forget you!" What a low, pitiful cry it&#xD;
was. "Arthur, my ouily love, if I could go with&#xD;
you, I would-even into the arms of death."&#xD;
"Thank God, you cannot, then, for life is&#xD;
sweet, and you are young. Darling, I shall&#xD;
not see you when you are old."&#xD;
"No one ever will," said she, with strange&#xD;
calmness.&#xD;
"You think so now-but ah!"&#xD;
It was one of the fierce paroxysms-the&#xD;
very fiercest that had been-and Powell al-&#xD;
most thought it was the struggle of dissolu-&#xD;
tion; but after a while it passed, and then she&#xD;
heard him whisper under his breath a frag.&#xD;
ment of the grand old "Dies Irm." "&amp;amp;dva&#xD;
mefons pi stat is," he murmured, and she caught&#xD;
the words. For the firsttime-and yet she&#xD;
was not a heathen-they made her think of&#xD;
his soul.&#xD;
"0 Arthur," she cried, "shall I not pray&#xD;
for you ?-shall I not ask God to have mercy&#xD;
on you?"&#xD;
He murmured something unintelligible, but&#xD;
which sounded like assent; and, without&#xD;
changing her position, she poured forth her&#xD;
soul in a tide of passionate supplication. The&#xD;
whole strength of her undying love went into&#xD;
it, and never before had the silent forest heark-&#xD;
ened to such an appeal as now went forth,&#xD;
piercing the infinite spaces of eternity to the&#xD;
&#xD;
LRDRAYS LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
very throne, of God. Suddenly she stopped,&#xD;
for there was a change which even in the&#xD;
darkness she perceived. What it was she&#xD;
could not analyze, but she felt at once that the&#xD;
end was at hand.&#xD;
~Arthur, Arthur," she cried, wildly, "are&#xD;
you going?"&#xD;
He muttered something brokenly, and lay&#xD;
for a moment in a stupor. Then he started,&#xD;
and a smile swept over his face-a smile which&#xD;
even in the faint starlight Powell caught-and&#xD;
he murmured something of which she heard&#xD;
only one word-her own name. With that&#xD;
name still on his lips, a strong shiver seized&#xD;
him, the breath fluttered-ceased-the eyes&#xD;
closed-and the girl knew that she was deso-&#xD;
late.&#xD;
When Powell came to herself out of the&#xD;
awful blackness and blankness that followed,&#xD;
she was lying in her own room at Madame&#xD;
Girod's. Every thing around looked so quiet&#xD;
and so familiar, that for a moment she almost&#xD;
believed that she had waked from a horrible&#xD;
dream-but it was only for a moment, The&#xD;
next instant memory rushed over her-rushed&#xD;
not singly and by degrees-but suddenly, and&#xD;
in one awful whole. In a second, she remem-&#xD;
bered every thing, felt every thing, and, with&#xD;
a low, moaning cry-a protest, as it were,&#xD;
against life-she turned her face from the&#xD;
light, and buried it in the pillows.&#xD;
At that cry, the German teacher rose qui-&#xD;
etly from a seat behind the bed-curtains, and&#xD;
advancing laid her hand on the girl's brow.&#xD;
She started, for it was cooler than she ex-&#xD;
pected. Then she leaned over and spoke:&#xD;
"Liebcken, do you feel better?"&#xD;
The voice waS very sweet, and Powell&#xD;
opened her eyes. She had never fancied this&#xD;
woman much-indeed, she had taken quite a&#xD;
dislike to her, in the quick, inpatient fashion&#xD;
of youth-but now she read such earnest kind-&#xD;
ness in her eyes, that the sore heart opened at&#xD;
once to receive it.&#xD;
"Better l" she cried-then, with a burst,&#xD;
"Oh, why did you make me well again? Why&#xD;
did y6u not let me die?"&#xD;
"Child," said the German, gravely, "life&#xD;
and death are in God's hands. Were you so&#xD;
ready to go to Him, that you can talk like&#xD;
this?"&#xD;
"I shall never be more ready; and I would&#xD;
have gone anywhere with kim, Oh, Frilulein,&#xD;
tell me where he is buried."&#xD;
&#xD;
The Fritulein looked grave; but she also&#xD;
looked sad and infinitely pitiful. "Do you&#xD;
mean Captain Romeyne?" she asked, at&#xD;
length.&#xD;
"Whom else should I mean? Oh, my poor&#xD;
love l He died in these arms, and i-i must&#xD;
live on, and never see him again."&#xD;
"Died! My poor child, are you sure of&#xD;
that?"&#xD;
"Am I sure? Friiulein, what do you&#xD;
mean? Did I not see him die ?-did I not&#xD;
feel the last quiver of life that passed over&#xD;
him ?-did I not-oh, why do you ask inc&#xD;
such a question? Why do you look at me so&#xD;
strangely? Fritulein, it cannot be-" She&#xD;
raised herself, and caught the teacher's arm,&#xD;
gazing the while passionately and wildly into&#xD;
the eyes that regarded her with such infinite&#xD;
compassion. "Speak I" she gasped. "It can-&#xD;
not be that he is alive?"&#xD;
"Yes, he is alive."&#xD;
The girl strove to speak, strove to question,&#xD;
strove evidently to say "Thank God!" but&#xD;
strength failed. Her hand relaxed its grasp&#xD;
on the teacher's sleeve, her eyes closed, her&#xD;
head sank back-she had fainted. Weeping&#xD;
softly, the German applied the usual remedies;&#xD;
and, as the swoon was slight, before long it&#xD;
yielded to them. Then, when the dark eyes&#xD;
once more opened, there was a question in&#xD;
their depths, and, when the lips enclosed, it&#xD;
came rushing forth at once.&#xD;
"Fritulein, wrn he recover? Oh, God bless&#xD;
you for such news l But tell me-if he will&#xD;
ever be himself again?"&#xD;
"He will recover certainly; it is said, in-&#xD;
deed, he is much better now.&#xD;
"And where is he? When can I see&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
The teacher toyed nervously with the tas-&#xD;
sels of the bed-curtains, and looked away,&#xD;
avoiding Powell's eyes, and gazing out of the&#xD;
~wmdow.&#xD;
"You eau't see him at all," she said, at&#xD;
last. "He is gone."&#xD;
"Gone!"&#xD;
"He sailed yesterday for England."&#xD;
This time no swoon was 'kind enough~ to&#xD;
come. On the contrary, the startled eyes&#xD;
opened wider and wider, with incredulity in&#xD;
their gaze. It seemed, indeed, as if they could&#xD;
not take themselves from the teacher's face,&#xD;
until the expression of that face repeated the&#xD;
news so sharply told. Then there was a cry-&#xD;
a low, pitiful cry, as of one wounded unto~&#xD;
&#xD;
POWELL VA&#xD;
&#xD;
RDRAY'S LIFE.                       139&#xD;
death-and the girl once more sunk back and&#xD;
buried her face from the light. This time she&#xD;
tasted the full bitterness of desolation, and,&#xD;
tasting it, cried out for death as a release.&#xD;
But death came not at her desire. Slowly&#xD;
and by degrees, life flowed into her veins, and&#xD;
beat in her languid pulses. Slowly the duties&#xD;
of existence thronged back upon her, and she&#xD;
rose up to meet them. She did so with a&#xD;
strange, stunned quietude, a sort of dead apa-&#xD;
thy, the feeling and the~ bearing of one in&#xD;
whom Fate had spent its last blow. She did&#xD;
not think she could ever suffer another pang,&#xD;
and so went on her weary round, until one day&#xD;
all this false quiet was suddenly shivered,&#xD;
when the news came that the vessel in which&#xD;
Arthur -Ilomeyne sailed for England, having&#xD;
met with adverse winds and storms, had gone&#xD;
down at sea.&#xD;
Not long after this, Alicia Murray came&#xD;
one day to see the young teacher, and from&#xD;
her Powell received an assurance which she&#xD;
would gladly have gone in sackcloth and ashes&#xD;
all her life to gain-the assurance that the&#xD;
man, for whom she had suffered so much, had&#xD;
not deserted her willingly, or even knowingly.&#xD;
When he was found helpless and insensible, a&#xD;
message had immediately been dispatched for&#xD;
a cousin of the Romeyne family, who was act-&#xD;
ing as British consul in one of the neighboring&#xD;
islands. When this man arrived, his first reso-&#xD;
lution was to take Romeyne at once to Eng-&#xD;
land. Mrs. Dering, who inspired the idea, sup.&#xD;
ported him in its execution, and the young&#xD;
man was removed to the vessel while yet una-&#xD;
ble to oppose, or even to understand, any&#xD;
thing that was in progress. in this state he&#xD;
sailed; and it was due to Mrs. During again,&#xD;
that all Kingston, having heard of his ivonder-&#xD;
ful recovery, believed that he had gone of his&#xD;
own free-will. The plan was well enough laid;&#xD;
but, whether i~ would have succeeded in its&#xD;
final result, was never known. God stretched&#xD;
forth His arm of power, the winds and the&#xD;
waves rose up to do His bidding, and all was&#xD;
over. The good ship went down, the ocean.&#xD;
tides swept over the heart that might have&#xD;
been so true, and yet again might have been&#xD;
so false; and all love, all hope, all suffering,&#xD;
was at an end forever.&#xD;
Here, also, ended Powell Vardray's life.&#xD;
In all the years of her existence, she never&#xD;
lived again. Yet these years were quiet enough,&#xD;
and in one sense-the sense of duty fulfilled&#xD;
and work performed-even happy. She never&#xD;

&#xD;
murmured at their length or their sameness, helped to bury the dead. She gave herself no&#xD;
She had lived her life, and that seemed to rest, either night or day; and, when all was&#xD;
suffice. Yet, as she once told Arthur Romeyne, over, when the pestilence passed, and health&#xD;
she did not live to grow old. Before that came back to those whom death had spared,&#xD;
time, the summoned, who comes to all, came she sickened and died. By her own request,&#xD;
to her. A terrible fever decimated the island, one side of the stone which marks her grave&#xD;
and, in the midst of panic and dismay, she bears this inscription:&#xD;
nursed the sick, tended the dying, and even        "1db babe gelebt und geliebet."&#xD;
THE END.&#xD;
&#xD;
body could for an instant compare it to the&#xD;
elegant villas which were scattered to the&#xD;
westward, and monopolized all that fair out-&#xD;
look of rolling country which had once been&#xD;
its own-neither was it a very comfortable&#xD;
house, according to modem ideas of comfort.&#xD;
But you rarely find, nowadays, such work as&#xD;
that of the panelled walls or richly-carved&#xD;
chimney-pieces, and there were nooks and&#xD;
corners about it, odd rooms stored away in all&#xD;
sorts of unaccountable places, and closets al-&#xD;
most as large as rooms under the strange,&#xD;
dark, winding staircases, which gave it a&#xD;
charm that the most commodious and thor-&#xD;
oughly-ventilated houses oftener lack than&#xD;
possess. Then, there was the back piazza, all&#xD;
latticed in and covered with green vines, until&#xD;
it had the seclusion, and more than the cool-&#xD;
ness, of a drawing-room: And beyond this&#xD;
piazza was the gem of the whole establishment&#xD;
-the old-fashioned garden, shut in from the&#xD;
outer world by a high wall, through which no&#xD;
one could peer, and over which no one could&#xD;
climb, occupying nearly a square, full of fruit-&#xD;
trees, fragrant with flowers, and abounding in&#xD;
shrubs that half a century before had been&#xD;
trimmed into the formal regularity of art, but&#xD;
had now overgrown every thing with the wild&#xD;
luxuriance of Nature.&#xD;
It was in this garden that the flickering&#xD;
April sunlight marked twelve o'clock on a&#xD;
sundial that occupied the middle of a green&#xD;
plat, round the borders of which bright-hued&#xD;
lowers of the spring were blooming,. while&#xD;
just in front of it was an arbor draped all&#xD;
over with that fragrant darling of the Caro-&#xD;
lina woods, the yellow jasmine. Within this&#xD;
arbor, framed, as it ware, by the green ten-&#xD;
drils and golden bells, sat a young girl, busily&#xD;
engaged in drawing, at a small table. Seen&#xD;

I.&#xD;
T WELVE o'clock.&#xD;
Not midnight, but bright, soft noonday&#xD;
-the noonday of lovely April-in the old-&#xD;
fashioned garden of an old-fashioned house,&#xD;
located in the very midst of the business por-&#xD;
tion of the large and flourishing town of&#xD;
W-. It had once been a very elegant&#xD;
residence, this old house, and had stood on the&#xD;
outskirts of the town, with pleasant hills and&#xD;
valleys, waving woods ahd green fields, sweep-&#xD;
ing up to the very verge of the garden. But&#xD;
now, all around it, flowed a busy tide of&#xD;
trade; warehouses of cotton and tobacco rose&#xD;
on citherside; wagons and drays rattled past&#xD;
unceasingly; in the rear, a car-shop belched&#xD;
forth black smoke; while engines screamed,&#xD;
and trains rumbled heavily back and forth, at&#xD;
all hours of the night and day. Still, even&#xD;
amid these discordant surroundings, the old&#xD;
house held its own bravely, and, wrapping it-&#xD;
self about with a mantle of dignified reserve,&#xD;
looked down with the pride of conscious an-&#xD;
tiquity upon all these new-comers of the later&#xD;
time. It had a right to do this, since its own&#xD;
recollections went back to the time when the&#xD;
Georges were kings, and when, at intervals,&#xD;
the red-men gathered strength to sweep down&#xD;
upon the dove-cots of their invaders. It was&#xD;
pointed out by the W-ites as the place&#xD;
where Cornwallis had established his head-&#xD;
quarters, and where he and his. courtly staff&#xD;
had once given a ball, and with the fair Tory&#xD;
ladies of the place danced a summer's night&#xD;
through. Life and death, and joy and sor-&#xD;
row, had each had its own time within its&#xD;
dark old wails; yet, still it stood, a memorial&#xD;
of the stately past, and, in some wise, a re-&#xD;
buke of the flippant present. It was not a&#xD;
pretty house, as beauty is reckoned now-no-&#xD;

&#xD;
under favorable circumstances, she might ha~&#xD;
been, and no doubt was, exceedingly pretty&#xD;
but just now she looked pale and weary; he&#xD;
dress was careless; her hair was hastily&#xD;
pushed back, and gathered in a rough, laos&#xD;
knot behind; while her forehead was drai~&#xD;
into a frown that ill became its pearly white&#xD;
ness. On the table before her la2y open a cas&#xD;
of mathematical-drawing instruments, and&#xD;
was with these that she worked, tracing ou&#xD;
intricate designs of an apparently mechanic&#xD;
character on a large sheet of card-board, am&#xD;
now and then noting down certain numerical&#xD;
results on a sheet of paper near at hand. I'&#xD;
was weary work, and when, at last, she glance&#xD;
up, and saw that it was twelve o'clock, sh&#xD;
threw down her pencil with an air of unmis.&#xD;
taxable relief.&#xD;
"I must go and see about dinner," she&#xD;
said, half aloud; and, as she said it, she took&#xD;
up a large portfolio from the ground beside&#xD;
her chair, and began to put the drawing away.&#xD;
While she was thus occupied, a clear, fresh&#xD;
voice suddenly called, "Annie!', A quick,&#xD;
ringing step sounded on the gravel walk, and,&#xD;
round a group of shrubs that formed a perfect&#xD;
cloud of tinted bloom, a young man of the&#xD;
most frank and cheery presence imaginable&#xD;
came into sight. He was not particularly&#xD;
handsome, but he had a graceful, well-knit&#xD;
figure, and an open, pleasant face, while his&#xD;
whole manner diffused such an air of moral&#xD;
sunshine that it was no yonder the gloom&#xD;
parted and fled from' the girl's brow at once.&#xD;
"Louis!" she cried, eagerly; and then&#xD;
smiled, and added, in a tone of absurdly-&#xD;
weak reproof, "You provoking boy! how you&#xD;
startled me! What on earth brings you here&#xD;
at this hour of the day?"&#xD;
"Kiss me, pretty one, and I'll tell you,"&#xD;
said the new-coiner, gayly. Then, having&#xD;
taken this favor,' without incurring any rebuke&#xD;
thereby, he added, more gravely: "Annie,&#xD;
darling, congratulate me-my fortune is n~ade!&#xD;
If your father agrees, we can be married this&#xD;
day two months."&#xD;
"'Oh!" said Annie, with a gasp; but the&#xD;
color came into her face, and made her abso-&#xD;
lutely lovely, "0 Louis! how? what? Tell&#xD;
me what you mean-tell me all about it I"&#xD;
The young man kissed her again. lie was&#xD;
evidently glowing with triumph, and found it&#xD;
hard to contain his exultation within moderate&#xD;
bounds.&#xD;
"I mean just what I say," he answered;&#xD;
&#xD;
re "but, as for telling you all about it, I can't do&#xD;
; that, dearest, for I am bound to secrecy. I&#xD;
~r can only tell you this: my fortune-our for-&#xD;
y tune-is made, and you are mine."&#xD;
e "I was always that!" she cried, with&#xD;
ii 9oinething between a laugh and a sob. "But,&#xD;
surely, Louis, you can tell me a little more&#xD;
e than this. If it is to be our fortune, surely I&#xD;
t have a right to know how it is' made."&#xD;
t "Can't you trust me~ Annie?"&#xD;
"Trust you 1 Indeed, yes-ever and al-&#xD;
I ways. But, then, you know we are pledged&#xD;
1 not to keep any secrets from each other."&#xD;
"Only such as honor demands; and this is&#xD;
I a case of honor. However, I can tell you a&#xD;
little, the general outline of the matter. Here,&#xD;
let us sit down and talk at our leisure. Now,&#xD;
that is better. Well, to begin rather far from&#xD;
the point, and not so far either, you know I&#xD;
have always had a decided mechanical talent,&#xD;
and, thanks to your father's kindness, I have&#xD;
acquired some aptitude in turning it to ac-&#xD;
count."&#xD;
"Yes," said Annie, with a rueful glance&#xD;
at the portfolio; "yes, I know you have, and&#xD;
I know you will end by being as bad as he is,&#xD;
if you do not stop yourself in time."&#xD;
"Stop myself!" repeated the young man,&#xD;
with a laugh. "Why, little simpleton, the sci-&#xD;
ence of mechanics is the lever of the world&#xD;
nowadays, and in all the world there is no bet-&#xD;
ter or more direct road to fortune than that&#xD;
which it opens. If we are married two months&#xD;
hence, it will be thanks to mechanics."&#xD;
The girl's face fell a little; but she did not&#xD;
utter any thing, excepting the simple inter.&#xD;
rogative-&#xD;
"How?"&#xD;
"Br mcans of a great invention," an-&#xD;
swered the young man, with color rising to&#xD;
his face, and Ught flashing in his eyes-" am&#xD;
invention which will be the greatest since&#xD;
steam, and which will go far ~to revolutionize&#xD;
the whole system of mechanics, as known to&#xD;
the world atpresent. I wish I could show it&#xD;
to you, Annie darling'; I wish I could tell you.&#xD;
-But what is the matter? Why do you look&#xD;
at mc as if-as if you were disappointed 1"'&#xD;
"Because I am disappointed!" cried the&#xD;
girl; and, before her lover knew what she was&#xD;
about, she had laid her head down on the table&#xD;

&#xD;
so flushed with hope to have it dashed by that&#xD;
word, to her, of' fatal omen-" invention."&#xD;
" I thought you meant something real-&#xD;
something to be relied on," she sobbed. "0O&#xD;
Louis, how could you disappoint me so cruel-&#xD;
ly ! Oh, I am so sorry, so very sorry, that&#xD;
this fever-God knows I am almost tempted&#xD;
to call it this madness-has seized you, tool&#xD;
Louis, for Heaven's sake put it from you !&#xD;
Trust to the steady results of honest labor,&#xD;
and not to these wild schemes of a fortune to&#xD;
be made at one stroke. Look at my father!&#xD;
let him be a warning to you. See bow his&#xD;
life has been spent in the service of this&#xD;
wretched science-how many inventions, that&#xD;
were to benefit the world, he has made-and&#xD;
where and how he is to-day ! Oh, I had so&#xD;
hoped that with you I should be free from this&#xD;
weary toil that comes to nothing, this cager&#xD;
counting on dreams that are shadowy as air!&#xD;
And now-Louis, Louis, you will break my&#xD;
heart !"&#xD;
" Dear love, I hope not," said Louis, half&#xD;
concerned, half amused. " You don't appre-&#xD;
ciate your father, Annie. You don't know&#xD;
what a great man he is-what a great man he&#xD;
yet will be in the face of that world which has&#xD;
treated him as from the beginning it has al-&#xD;
ways treated genius-has robbed him, and&#xD;
laughed at him, and refused to hear him !&#xD;
But it will hear him yet. There never was a&#xD;
great mind that did not have to pass through&#xD;
this ordeal; there never was a great discovery&#xD;
that was not met by this opposition; there&#xD;
never was a great achievement that did not&#xD;
have to triumph over these difficulties. It&#xD;
has been hard on you, my poor pet ; but I&#xD;
hope the hardest is over at last. Apart from&#xD;
my good fortune, your father tells me' that he&#xD;
is working on- an invention, which he thinks&#xD;
the greatest he has ever made, and the patent-&#xD;
right of which he does not mean to put out&#xD;
of his own hands."&#xD;
" Yes, he is working at it," said the girl,&#xD;
wearily, and once more she glanced at the&#xD;
portfolio. " I have been making out some of&#xD;
the drawings," she added ; " but he forbade&#xD;
me to show them, even to you. He has been&#xD;
robbed so often, that he has grown very sus-&#xD;
picious now. Sometimes, I think he is reluc-&#xD;
tant to trust even me. 0 Louis, it is so sad !&#xD;
And to think that you have started on the&#xD;
same path"&#xD;
" I have only made it 'beginning, dear, and&#xD;
as for my being a great inventor, you may set&#xD;
&#xD;
your mind at rest on that point. Nature did&#xD;
not favor me with the rare gift of original&#xD;
conception. I can only work out other men's&#xD;
thoughts, and sometimes bring them to a&#xD;
practical issue. This is all that I have done&#xD;
now. A gentleman, a friend of mine-I can-&#xD;
not tell you his name, because he desires that&#xD;
it may be kept secret-conceived a new idea&#xD;
in mechanics, but, lacking practical knowl-&#xD;
edge of the science, he could not work it out&#xD;
in practical form. So he brought a rough&#xD;
draught of the invention to me, and told me&#xD;
that, if I could perfect it, I might take out&#xD;
the patent, and share half the profits. I saw&#xD;
at once what a magnificent thing it would be&#xD;
if ft could be perfected; so I fell into the idea&#xD;
forthwith, and went to work. 0 Annie, how&#xD;
I worked ! I saw fortune and you before me,&#xD;
and I never drew rein night or day. But,&#xD;
after a while, the inventor's fever came over&#xD;
me, and the fascination of the science overtook&#xD;
me,. Then I forgot all about fortune, I even&#xD;
forgot all about you, and worked on and on,&#xD;
only that I might reach the result which&#xD;
seemed ever before me and yet ever eluding&#xD;
me. It eluded me for a long time, and no one&#xD;
but an inventor can imagine the fever in&#xD;
which I lived during that time. Waking or&#xD;
sleeping, I thought of nothing else-saw&#xD;
nothing else ; and when, at last, one day the&#xD;
solution of my difficulties came to me like a&#xD;
flash of inspiration, I shouted until my neigh-&#xD;
bors thought that I was mad. I wanted then&#xD;
to throw down pencil and paper and rush to&#xD;
you; but Mr.-, I mean the original inventor,&#xD;
held me bound to absolute secrecy, and he did&#xD;
not relax this requirement even when all the&#xD;
specifications were made out and forwarded to&#xD;
the Patent-Office. It was not until this morn-&#xD;
ing, when he came and told me that the patent&#xD;
was finally issued, that he also told me I might-&#xD;
announce the fact to my friends, provided I&#xD;
didn't divulge his name. Heaven only knows&#xD;
why he should wish to give me all the credit,&#xD;
as. well as half the profits; but one thing is&#xD;
certain, my darling-our fortune is made, and&#xD;
you are mine!1"&#xD;
He caught the girl in his arms at the last&#xD;
words, and kissed her again and again, while&#xD;
she could only lay her head down on his shoul-&#xD;
der and indulge in an hysterical combination&#xD;
of laughter and tears.&#xD;
"I am happy, Louis, and grateful-oh,&#xD;
so grateful!1" she said, as well as the laughter&#xD;
and tears aforesaid would allow ; " but, dear&#xD;

&#xD;
love, I should be still more happy, still moi&#xD;
grateful, if the fortune had come to you in an&#xD;
other way. It seems to me like gambling-&#xD;
like something that means prosperity for&#xD;
little while, but ruin in the end. I may b&#xD;
very foolish, but that is the way it seems t&#xD;
me, and then-O Louis, I feel sure that, i&#xD;
some way oi- other, it will bring us ill-luck "&#xD;
Louis -smiled at this ; but he did not at&#xD;
tempt any thing like reason in reply. On th&#xD;
contrary, he changed the subject, and aske4&#xD;
the foreboding girl if her father was at home&#xD;
"I did not see him as I came through th&#xD;
house," he said; ,"and I am on thorns until:&#xD;
tell him my good, luck, and hear him assur&#xD;
me that I may take you as soon as I please."&#xD;
"He is not likely to give you that assur&#xD;
ance to-day,"' said she, nodding archly. -&#xD;
"Is he not.?. Well, let us go and see."&#xD;
They went accordingly, sauntering side byj&#xD;
'side down the garden-paths bordered within&#xD;
rows of tall box, and -enlivened here and&#xD;
there by fragrant lilacs and sweet purple wis&#xD;
teria, until they reached the latticed piazza&#xD;
From this they entered a narrow, dark pas-.&#xD;
sage, made still darker from the fact of the&#xD;
front door being closed, and thence passed&#xD;
into a room that resembled an amateur ma-&#xD;
chine-shop more than any thing else. Mathe-&#xD;
matical and mechanical designs lined the&#xD;
walls ; models, in minature, of all machines,&#xD;
in connection with which steam has ever been&#xD;
used as a motive power, occupied every avail-&#xD;
able space--excepting that which was filled&#xD;
by a large lockedl cabinet-and in the midst&#xD;
of this apparent disorder stood a table, littered&#xD;
over with paper and drawing-materials. An-&#xD;
nie looked round the apartment and shook her&#xD;
head'.                    .      .&#xD;
"Papa is not here,"' she said. "You must&#xD;
remain on thorns a little longer, Louis."&#xD;
"May he not be in the house some-&#xD;
where ?"-&#xD;
" No, he has gone out. Don't you see his&#xD;
hat is missing ? He has gone to themachine-&#xD;
shops, I am sure. He often goes there for&#xD;
what he calls ' practical suggestions.' Come,&#xD;
let us sit on the piazza. This room is so dark&#xD;
and cold that it makes me shiver."&#xD;
VER much like the fortunes of the old&#xD;
house were the fortunes of the man who at&#xD;
present inhabited it. He was a gentleman of&#xD;
good descent, as his name-the noble Scottish&#xD;
&#xD;
re name of Gordon-amply testified ; and he had&#xD;
ty once possessed a more than moderate amount&#xD;
- of wealth ; but, having been blessed, or rather&#xD;
a cursed, with the gift of invention, this wealth&#xD;
e had melted away to satisfy the insatiate de-&#xD;
o mands of scientific experiment, until little or&#xD;
n none of it remained. After his fortune was&#xD;
gone, he soon exhausted the long-suffering pa-&#xD;
-tience of his friends. They were all practical,&#xD;
e worldly-wise people, and, regarding him as a&#xD;
di half-mad visionary, troubled themselves very&#xD;
.little about the manner in which they expressed&#xD;
e this opinion. Naturally enough, Mr. Gordon&#xD;
I resented its expression, and, naturally also, a&#xD;
formal break was the result. Being a widower&#xD;
with only one child, he took this child, and&#xD;
- the yet dearer children of his brain--his in-&#xD;
v-entions-and went forth into the world to&#xD;
conquer fortune. Instead of conquering, h-ow-&#xD;
ever, he was speedily conquered. , Men laughed&#xD;
Iat his inventions, and then stole them; patent-.&#xD;
Irights, of his own discoveries, were taken out&#xD;
- before his eyes; and he fell a victim to the&#xD;
.countless modes of swindle and legal robbery&#xD;
that, from first to last, lie in wait for the in-&#xD;
ventor, and filch from him both the glory and&#xD;
the profit he has toiled to gain. After a time,&#xD;
he drifted to W--, and became an inmate&#xD;
of the rambling old house already, described.&#xD;
Here he lived an eremite sort of existence,&#xD;
working with feverish energy at an invention,&#xD;
which was to revolutionize the whole system&#xD;
of mechanics, and make not one, but a dozens&#xD;
fortunes for himself.' Here, also, he made the&#xD;
acquaintance of Louis Bernard, a young civil&#xD;
engineer of unusual promise and talent. De-&#xD;
spite this promise and talent, however, the&#xD;
young man was poor as a church mouse. But,&#xD;
in Mr. Gordon's eyes, this fact was any thing&#xD;
but a disadvantage. He was so very eccen-&#xD;
tric--so very crazy, his friends said-that he&#xD;
looked upon poverty somewhat in the light&#xD;
of a badge of merit ; and, wheni he found that&#xD;
a love-affair was developing between his pretty&#xD;
Annie and young Bernard, instead of turning&#xD;
the penniless suitor out-of-doors, he told him&#xD;
that he might marry the maiden a's soon as&#xD;
he could support her in a respectable inanner.&#xD;
Encouraged in this way, the love-affair be-&#xD;
came an authorized engagement, and was of&#xD;
six months' standing on that bright April&#xD;
morning when our story 'opened-.&#xD;
Now, while the two lovers satt on the trel-&#xD;
lised piazza, and, with the glory of sunlight&#xD;
and fragrance of flowers around them,- laid&#xD;
&#xD;
144&#xD;
&#xD;
145&#xD;
&#xD;
countless plans for their blissful future, Mr.&#xD;
Gordon, as his daughter had rightly surmised,&#xD;
was peering in and out among the machinery&#xD;
.of the engine and ear-shops, located near his&#xD;
house. These car-shops formed quite a large&#xD;
establishment, for the railroad, to which they&#xD;
belonged, was very flourishing, and it was&#xD;
here that most of its rolling-stock was con-&#xD;
structed. Consequently, the .latest improve-&#xD;
ments in machinery were always to be found&#xD;
here, and consequently, also, it was a great&#xD;
resort of Mr. Gordon's. The employes knew&#xD;
him well, and, although they considered him&#xD;
a little "touched," liked him amazingly. The&#xD;
authorities, however, looked at him askance,&#xD;
and it was only the master-machinist who ever&#xD;
went out of his way to do him a kindness, or&#xD;
show him a civility.&#xD;
This man, though only thirty-five, ranked&#xD;
high in his calling, and had entire control of&#xD;
the works. His name was Liddell; he was&#xD;
gentlemanly, though not a gentleman, and had&#xD;
for some time assiduously cultivated Mr. Gor-&#xD;
don's acquaintance. To accomplish this was&#xD;
not difficult, since there was that best possible&#xD;
foundation for acquaintanceship, a common&#xD;
taste, between them. But the most natural&#xD;
things frequently excite' gossip in a country-&#xD;
town ; and unscrupulous news-mongers did&#xD;
not hesitate to say that the bright eyes of&#xD;
Annie Gordon possessed more attraction to&#xD;
the master-machinist than did her father's&#xD;
discourses ~on cog-wrheels and piston-rods.&#xD;
however that might be, Mr. Liddell was one&#xD;
of the few visitors who ever crossed the thresh-&#xD;
old of the old house ; and, in a quiet way,,&#xD;
both father and daughter liked him cordially.&#xD;
On this morning, as Mr. Gordon stood at-&#xD;
tentively regarding the action of a certain new-&#xD;
fangled cylinder, the master-machinist came&#xD;
out of his office and walked up to him.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you, Mr. Gordon," said&#xD;
-he, after the first salutations were exchanged,&#xD;
"to congratulate you on young Bernard's'good&#xD;
luck. What a fortunate thing it is for him !&#xD;
-and I suppose I may congratulate Miss An-&#xD;
nie, too."&#xD;
.Mr. Gordon looked up, and, with his head&#xD;
full of the cylinder, did not understand 'the&#xD;
drift of this remark.&#xD;
"Bernard's good luck !" he repeated. "I&#xD;
have not heard of any special luck of his.&#xD;
What has he fallen upon ? A good position ?"&#xD;
"Something much better than a good po-&#xD;
sition," answered Liddell, shrugging his shoul-&#xD;
&#xD;
ders. " I wonder you have not heard-every-&#xD;
body is full of it-he has made a fortune by a&#xD;
patent."&#xD;
" A fortune !-by a patent !"&#xD;
"A fortune, undoubtedly, and by a patent.&#xD;
Why, I am astonished you don't know any&#xD;
thing about it. I supposed, of course, Ber-&#xD;
nard had been consulting you all this time.&#xD;
And in faet I thought-I felt sure-that you&#xD;
had a hand in the matter.. The idea looks like&#xD;
you-at least I fancied as much."&#xD;
" What is the ideal?" asked Me Gordon,&#xD;
all in a fever, immediately. " The scamp has&#xD;
told me nothing whatever about it-very shab-&#xD;
by of him, I think ! I always knew he had&#xD;
sense, however-I always knew he would&#xD;
make his fortune sooner or later-only I did&#xD;
not 'look for it quite so soon! What is the&#xD;
idea, Mr. Liddell? Bless my soul !-to think&#xD;
of a patent !"&#xD;
" The idea is something quite new, at least&#xD;
in machinery," said Liddell. " I don't know&#xD;
that I can explain it-'m not a good hand at&#xD;
description-but if you'll step into my office I&#xD;
can show you a design that Bernard made out&#xD;
to show me what it was, and how it worked.&#xD;
That fellow has a most capital head,"&#xD;
"Yes," said Mr. Gordon, assenting most&#xD;
sincerely about the head ; but, he hesitated,&#xD;
and evidently did not like to inspect the de-&#xD;
sign. " If Bernard had wished me to see it-"&#xD;
he began, with some dignity, but Liddell in-&#xD;
terrupted him.&#xD;
"My dear sir," he exclaimed with a laugh,&#xD;
" don't you see why Bernard said nothing to&#xD;
you about it ? He was afraid the thing might&#xD;
not succeed, and he wanted to spring a success&#xD;
and not a failure upon you. No doubt he is&#xD;
at your house now, telling the good news to&#xD;
'Miss Annie, and, meanwhile, where is the harm&#xD;
of taking a look at the design ? The patent&#xD;
being all safe, anybody and everybody may&#xD;
see it."&#xD;
" I suppose there is no harm," said Mr.'&#xD;
Gordon ; and, the temptation being too strong&#xD;
for his dignity to resist, he forsook the cylin-&#xD;
der, and followed the machinist to his office.&#xD;
This office was a small box, with a table,&#xD;
two chairs, and'a desk, in it. Placing one of&#xD;
the chairs beside' the table, for his visitor,&#xD;
Liddell opened the desk and busied himself in&#xD;
extracting a particular paper from a' crowded&#xD;
pigeon-hole. After some trouble, this was ac-&#xD;
complished, and then he unfolded and spread&#xD;
it out-a large sheet covered with India-ink&#xD;

him almost as if it had been one of his own. "I hope you are not vexed with Bernard&#xD;
Bernard's invention! He was eager to see for not letting you know. I assure you-"&#xD;
what the boy had managed to accomplish; so Something in the face before him stopped&#xD;
eager, indeed, that for a moment this very the machinist at this point. Involuntarily he&#xD;
eagerness defeated its own object. The paper ceased speaking, and said nothing, even when,&#xD;
swam before his eyes, the diagrams danced to after several minutes had elapsed, Mr. Gordon&#xD;
and fro, and he saw nothing. After a second, rose and silently left the office.&#xD;
however, the mist cleared, and then, as his He walked down the street toward his own&#xD;
glance fell on the principal design, the idea house like one stunned. The people who met&#xD;
showed itself clear and distinct. Ite saw it, him looked in his face, shrugged their shoul-&#xD;
caught it, suddenly gasped, and fell back into ders, and said to each other, "The man grows&#xD;
his chair almost fainting, more crazy every day." But when he reached&#xD;
Liddell, who was looking at him, was sen- home, when he opened and closed the front-&#xD;
ously alarmed, for he thought l~e had at least door, crossed the passage and stood in his&#xD;
a case of apoplexy on his hands. Seizing own room, this unreal quietude gave way. He&#xD;

their due effect. Mr. Gordon recovered him- successful issue; he glanced at the table&#xD;
self; looked up, and finally spoke-with a where long lines of abstruse calculation met&#xD;
strangely-pitiful quaver in his voice: his eye; then, with one deep groan, he sank&#xD;
"Let me see it ao'ain. I-I must have into a scat, buried his face from the light, and&#xD;

"My dear sir, what is the matter?" cried In this state his daughter found him, when&#xD;
Liddelk "Is there any thing " she entered, followed by her lover. Her eyes&#xD;
"The design! the design!" interrupted were so dazzled by the bright sunshine, from&#xD;
the inventor, with feverish energy. "My which she had come, that for a moment she&#xD;

The tone was so peremptory that the other she caught sight of it, and rushed forward,&#xD;

don leaned forward, examining it intently. "Papa! what is the matter?"&#xD;
He said nothing; but the naturally pale hue Mr. Gordon raised his face, and the mere&#xD;
of his complexion grew almost ashy, and his sight of it seemed to petrify her, for she&#xD;
hands clasped and unclasped themselves con- stopped suddenly, and stood motionless. Nev-&#xD;

lable, tottered, rather than walked, to the father's eyes. "Papa!" she cried again, with&#xD;
door. By this time, however, Liddell had a startled appeal in her voice-and as she&#xD;
somewhat recovered from his first surprise, paused Bernard spoke.&#xD;
and thought it time to interfere; so he fol- "Something has happened, Mr. Gordon!&#xD;
lowed and caught his arm. Something is the matter! What is it?" he&#xD;
"Mr. Gordon, pray sit down," he said, said, hastily.&#xD;
"You are not fit to go out in this state. Take In a moment, as it were, the inventor was&#xD;
some water-try to compose yourself-Good himself-indeed, more than himself. Few&#xD;
Heavens, sir! what is the matter?" people who knew the abstracted 'devotee of&#xD;

science, the pale scholar whose mind wa&#xD;
habitually absent from the earth he trod&#xD;
would have recognized him in the man whi&#xD;
faced around upon the speaker, his face glow&#xD;
ing with passionate efiergy, and h5 eyes flash&#xD;
ing with indignant fire.&#xD;
"You ask me that!" he said. "Yo,&#xD;
dare to enter my room, side by side with m~&#xD;
daughter, and speak to me-to me whom yoi&#xD;
have so shamelessly betrayed 1' Your audaci&#xD;
ty almost equals your villany, and I have ho&#xD;
one answer for you-leave my house!,,&#xD;
There is no exaggeration in saying that ii&#xD;
a thunder-bolt from heaven had rent the solic&#xD;
walls asunder, neither Bernard nor Annie&#xD;
could have been more confounded than b1&#xD;
this unexpected and unprecedented outbreak,&#xD;
"Oh, my poor father!" cried the girl, undci&#xD;
her breath, for she thought the veritable mad.&#xD;
ness had come at last; but the young man&#xD;
after one gasp of astonishment, saw that there&#xD;
wus nothing of insanity in the steady face&#xD;
fronting him, and, as well as he could com~&#xD;
mand himself; answered:&#xD;
"I don't understand this. I am so little&#xD;
conscious of having offended you, that I must&#xD;
ask you to be more explicit. What have I&#xD;
done? What do you mean by accusing me&#xD;
of villany-by saying that I have betrayed&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"Answer me one question," said the elder&#xD;
man, sternly. "Have you not patented an in-&#xD;
vention?"&#xD;
"An invention!" Bernard started; then&#xD;
added more quietly, "I came this morning to&#xD;
tell you that I had done so."&#xD;
"To tell me!" It is impossible for words&#xD;
to express the indignant scorn that was in&#xD;
those three words-" To tell me! Well, in&#xD;
return, I will tell you that you arc a thief!"&#xD;
"Papa!"&#xD;
It was Annie's voice that rang through the&#xD;
room with this cry of indignant reproach, but,&#xD;
for a full minute, Bernard made neither sound&#xD;
nor movement. When those bitter words fell&#xD;
on his ear, he took one quick, unconscious&#xD;
step forward; but the next he remembered&#xD;
himself; and fell back. In the minute that&#xD;
followed, he fought a fierce fight for self-con-&#xD;
trol, and gained the victory. When at last he&#xD;
spoke, the veins were standing out on his fore-&#xD;
head like knotted cords, but his voice was&#xD;
steady and firm.&#xD;
"I have only one reply to make, sir-sub-&#xD;
stantiate the charge."&#xD;
&#xD;
a     "That is easy enough to do, if you will be&#xD;
1, kind enough to describe the nature of your in-&#xD;
~ mention."&#xD;
Coldly and concisely the young man com-&#xD;
plied with the request. He described the na-&#xD;
turn of the conception which he had worked&#xD;
out to a successful result, and briefly added&#xD;
the explanation which he had already made&#xD;
1 to Annie, a statement that the original inven-&#xD;
- tion was not his own, and an account of the&#xD;
difficulty he had encountered in bringing it to&#xD;
practical operation. Mr. Gordon heard him&#xD;
out, without interruption of any kind, and&#xD;
I was silent for a moment. Then he said&#xD;
frigidly:&#xD;
"Do you decline to give the name of the&#xD;
original inventor?"&#xD;
"I have no option but to decline, so long&#xD;
as he chooses to hold me bound to secrecy."&#xD;
"Is he likely to hold you bound to se-&#xD;
crecy if your good name is at stake in the&#xD;
matter?"&#xD;
*    The young man threw his head back&#xD;
haughtily.&#xD;
"My good name is not likely to be at&#xD;
stake, sir, with any one who knows me."&#xD;
"Is it not?" said the other, with a short,&#xD;
hard laugh. "Then it is only because men&#xD;
will believe your word in preference to that&#xD;
of the mad old inventor. Perhaps you count-&#xD;
ed upon this, however. If so, the calculation&#xD;
did you credit."&#xD;
"Papa! "-Annie broke in, with a wail,&#xD;
"why do you say such cruel things? Louis&#xD;
does not understand them, and neither do I.&#xD;
Speak plainly, for Heaven's sake! Tell him-&#xD;
tell me-of what you suspect him."&#xD;
"I suspect him of nothing," said Mr. Gor-&#xD;
don, sternly; "on his own evidence I co~evict&#xD;
him of basely stealing my invention, th~ inven-&#xD;
tion at which I have labored so long-the in-&#xD;
vention which was dearer to me tban you, my&#xD;
child of flesh and blood-and of patenting it&#xD;
for his own use, and in his own name."&#xD;
"Papa!"&#xD;
"Look at him," said the inventor, rising&#xD;
and pointing with an almost tragic gesture at&#xD;
the young man. "Look at him! Tell me if&#xD;
that is the face of an innocent man."&#xD;
And in truth, at that moment, Bernard's&#xD;
face was scarcely that of an innocent man.&#xD;
The very nature of the accusation had stricken&#xD;
from him all means of defence, while its sud-&#xD;
denness so completely overwhelmed him, that&#xD;
he stood in the centre of the floe; a pale,&#xD;

&#xD;
silejit picture of what seemed detected guilt.&#xD;
Not so thought Annie, however. She gave&#xD;
one glance at his face, and then sprung to his&#xD;
Bide.&#xD;
"Louis, Louis, dear loVb, don't take it so!"&#xD;
she cried. "He does not mean it! he will be&#xD;
sorry for it yet.-Oh, it is cruel!" she ex-&#xD;
claimed, turninground upon her father. "You&#xD;
outrage him, and you outrage me! Papa,&#xD;
papa, how can you-how could you 1"'&#xD;
"Perhaps you have share in it, too," said&#xD;
the inventor, bitterly, as her voice broke down&#xD;
in tears. "I was a fool to trust you-to trust&#xD;
anybody. I might have known that treachery&#xD;
and robbery would be the end. With or with-&#xD;
out your connivance, he must have obtained&#xD;
the design from you."&#xD;
"From me!" cried thegirl, with a startled&#xD;
gasp-for she had not expected this. Then&#xD;
she turned to Bernard and held out her hand.&#xD;
"0 Louis, see how little he is himself! see&#xD;
how little he means it! see how little you can&#xD;
resent a charge in which I am included!"&#xD;
"I resent it only thus far," saidBernard,&#xD;
looking at Mr. Gordon. "I ask now, as I&#xD;
asked. before, to hear the evidence on which I&#xD;
am cond~nined."&#xD;
"You shall see it," answered the other,&#xD;
briefly. He went to the cabinet, unlocked the&#xD;
door, and took out a large portfolio. Bring-&#xD;
ing this to the table, he opened it, and bade&#xD;
the young man come forward. When he&#xD;
came, several designs were spread before him.&#xD;
He took them up, one by one, and examined&#xD;
them closely. This occupied some time, and&#xD;
after putting down the last one he still re-&#xD;
mained silent-his face deadly pale, and his&#xD;
eyes bent downward in deep thought. It was&#xD;
only when Mr. Gordon asked what he had to&#xD;
say, that he looked up and 'spoke.&#xD;
"I have only to say this-that Fate is&#xD;
against me," he answered. "I cannot refute&#xD;
the evidence of these papers. I am, indeed,&#xD;
astounded at it. I can only assert my own&#xD;
innocence-and of course that assertion counts&#xD;
for nothing with 'you. I do not believe that&#xD;
the man who applied to me stole the inven-&#xD;
tion; for, in the first place, he is a man of&#xD;
honor; and, in the second place, ha had no&#xD;
opportunity to do so. Therefore, I can only&#xD;
believe that it has been a strange coincidence&#xD;
of thought. God knows how much I regret&#xD;
having had any part in it; but of one thing&#xD;
you n~ay be. sure-until of your own accord&#xD;
you retract the accusation made this day, I I&#xD;
&#xD;
will never touch one cent of the profits. I&#xD;
have not much hope of such a thing-but the&#xD;
truth may come to light some day. Until&#xD;
then, sir, I return you many thanks for your&#xD;
past kindness, and bid you good-by. Of course,&#xD;
you know that I shall not enter your doors&#xD;
again. Annie-darling-"&#xD;
His voice broke down here; but he held&#xD;
out his hands, and in a moment Annie came to&#xD;
him with a rush. She was weeping bitterly,&#xD;
and in the midst of their parting embrace' only&#xD;
two or three words were exchanged. "Don't&#xD;
forget me!" sobbed the girl. "Trust me!"&#xD;
whispered the young man, and that was all.&#xD;
Then they tore themselves apart, and Bernard&#xD;
went hastily out. When the heavy front-door&#xD;
closed upon him, a hitter pang shot through his&#xD;
heart. He was drearily conscious that it was&#xD;
for the last time.&#xD;
ILL&#xD;
IT was near the close of a' soft October&#xD;
day, when Annie Gordon sat in the garden&#xD;
quite alone. She was not drawing, or reading,&#xD;
or even sewing, though some of the latter work&#xD;
lay on the ground by her side;' but she sat&#xD;
quite motionless on a low seat under a brilliant&#xD;
crape-myrtle, with the air of listless languor&#xD;
which is always so sad a sight-especially in&#xD;
a young person. Her hands were loosely&#xD;
clasped in her lap, and her eyes, all unheed-&#xD;
ing the gorgeous roses blooming near by, and&#xD;
scenting the air with their fragrance, were&#xD;
turned to the western sky, where, instead of&#xD;
the usual glories, a long, low bank of violet&#xD;
cloud had received the sun. She did not even&#xD;
turn when a step sounded on the path behind&#xD;
her, and when, with his head bent forward,&#xD;
I and his hands crossed behind his back, her&#xD;
father slowly came into sight. He was ab-&#xD;
sorbed in thought, evidently, and did not see&#xD;
1her until he was close upon her. Then he&#xD;
started and spoke almost sharply.&#xD;
"What are you doing here, Annie? I&#xD;
thought you said that you were going to see&#xD;
Mrs. Holt 1"'&#xD;
"I did go," said Annie, in a tone as list-&#xD;
less as her attitude, "but Mrs. Elolt was not&#xD;
at home. When I came back you were en-&#xD;
gaged with Mr. Liddeil, so I did not disturb&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"You might have come in to see Mr. Lid-&#xD;
dell. His visits are meant for you as much&#xD;
as, or more than, they are for me."&#xD;
"Are they?" said the girl, carelessly, and&#xD;
&#xD;
then she added, "I should be sorry to think&#xD;
so.,'&#xD;
Her father frowned a little. "Why?" he&#xD;
asked, shortly.&#xD;
"Because - oh, papa, surely you know&#xD;
why. It may be foolish to talk of such a&#xD;
thing, but I have thought once or twice that&#xD;
Mr. Liddell admired me-and if so, I would&#xD;
rather that he never came."&#xD;
"Do you mean to say that if he asked you&#xD;
to marry him, you would refuse him?"&#xD;
"I hope he will never ask me; butif he&#xD;
did, I should be obliged to refuse him."&#xD;
"And why?"&#xD;
"0 papa, what a question!" cried the&#xD;
girl, with her languor giving way at once, and&#xD;
her bosom rent with sobs. "Because I don't&#xD;
love him! Because I shall never, never love&#xD;
any one but my poor, injured, outcast, ill-&#xD;
treated Louis, Don't-don't mention him to&#xD;
me again."&#xD;
"I must mention him to you," said Mr.&#xD;
Gordon, and as he said it he sat down by her&#xD;
side. "You are not a child, Annie," he went&#xD;
on. "You are old enough to know that many&#xD;
things have to be done in this world which&#xD;
are not what we 'would desire for ourselves or&#xD;
others. I am old; I am broken in mind, in&#xD;
health, and in fortune. What will become of&#xD;
you when I die?"&#xD;
"God will take care of me."&#xD;
"God takes care of those who care for&#xD;
themselves. God will not work a miracle to&#xD;
put bread into your mouth or a roof over your&#xD;
head. Many, as young and helpless as you,&#xD;
He leaves every day to die of want and starva-&#xD;
tion. ~My child, you must do something for&#xD;
yourself-you must marry' the man who has&#xD;
just been telling me' how much he loves&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Papa I "-she gave a low cry.-" papa,&#xD;
surely you will not ask me to do this!"&#xD;
"You must do it!" said he, beginning to&#xD;
grow excited. "Child, child, do you not see&#xD;
that I cannot last much longer, and then-&#xD;
what will become of you?"&#xD;
"I would sew for my' daily bread, sooner&#xD;
than marry one man when I love another!"&#xD;
"Perhaps you will wait and marry the&#xD;
thief who robbed me?"&#xD;
"Papa, I don't deserve this!"&#xD;
"Marry Liddell, then. He is a good fel-&#xD;
low. Let me see you safely settled before I&#xD;
die-let me tell him when he comes again that&#xD;
he may take you."      -&#xD;
&#xD;
Oh, no, no I&#xD;
"This is nonsense," said Mr. Gordon.&#xD;
"What more do you expect than he offers?&#xD;
He may not be as fine a gentleman as ~ Gor-&#xD;
don has a right to marry; but we are poor-!&#xD;
so poor that our social equals 'do not recog-&#xD;
nize our existence; and he is comparatively&#xD;
wealthy. It is true that you would be the&#xD;
richest heiress in the country, if my inven-&#xD;
tions had not been stolen from me, but now-&#xD;
Annie, there is no help for it. You must mar-&#xD;
ry him."&#xD;
For at least an hour the discussion went&#xD;
on; but it came to no more definite point than&#xD;
this. At last both father and daughter re-&#xD;
turned to the house; and then, wearied and&#xD;
exhausted, Annie went up to her own room.&#xD;
She felt heartsick and hopeless at the prospect&#xD;
before her. Not that her resolution was at all&#xD;
shaken, or that she had any fear of being&#xD;
eventually forced to marry Liddell; but she&#xD;
knew that persistence was the most striking&#xD;
trait of her father's character, and she also&#xD;
knew that, for days and weeks and months to&#xD;
come, she might expect to hear and to combat&#xD;
just what she had heard and combated that&#xD;
evening. There can hardly be a prospect more&#xD;
dismaying than this, so it was no wonder that&#xD;
she s~t down and covered her face with her&#xD;
hands. When Bernard went away, she had&#xD;
felt sure that he would soon clear himself; and&#xD;
return to claim her, but now six months had&#xD;
gone by, and the stain on his name was as&#xD;
dark as ever, her father was as obstinately&#xD;
persuaded of~ his guilt, and her own faith and&#xD;
hope began to waver. "He has forgotten me!"&#xD;
she thought. "Why should I not forget him,&#xD;
and try to marry some one else?"' But she&#xD;
had hardly asked the question before she&#xD;
veered round as quickly as if some- one else&#xD;
had proposed it. "Even if I never see him&#xD;
again, I will be true to him-and true to my-&#xD;
self!" she cried; then burst into tears, and&#xD;
settled herself to sleep.&#xD;
Her fears proved to be well founded. 'The&#xD;
next day, and for many days after., Mr. Gor-&#xD;
don rang the changes on Liddell's suit with&#xD;
an obstinate persistence that 'would have&#xD;
shaken any resolution less thoroughly ground-&#xD;
ed than his daughter's. He did not storm, or&#xD;
threaten, or command-none of these things&#xD;
I were according to his nature-but he went&#xD;
I over the 'same position again and again,' re-&#xD;
peated the same statements, and made the&#xD;
same predictions, with a patience that was&#xD;

150                  BERNARD'S INVENTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
both marvellous and exhausting. It told a&#xD;
last, even on Annie. She was driven fros&#xD;
point to point, until, from sheer inability F&#xD;
continue the strife, she yielded thus far: sh&#xD;
agreed that Liddell should be allowed to com~&#xD;
to the house on trial, that there' was to bi&#xD;
nothing of an engagement, but that she wa~&#xD;
to see how she liked him, and, if she found ii&#xD;
possible (but she did not fail to protest her&#xD;
that she was sure she never would find it pos&#xD;
sible), she might enter into an engagement al&#xD;
the end of six months. On this anomalous&#xD;
sort of footing, therefore, the master-ma.&#xD;
chinist was received in the Gordon household&#xD;
and, since he had sense enough to appreciate&#xD;
the point he ~ad gained, and tact enough to&#xD;
use his advantage well, he soon became a&#xD;
daily visitor, for was it long before he per-&#xD;
ceived that not only Mi~. Gordon, but Annie&#xD;
herseW welcomed him 'with pleasure.&#xD;
Matters went on in this way until Christ-&#xD;
mas came. The gayety of the season-and&#xD;
W-,--- was very gay-sent not even an echo&#xD;
into the dark old house where the inventor&#xD;
and his daughter lived, and yet in all W-&#xD;
there was not a fairer face than Annie Gor-&#xD;
don's, as she leaned against one of the high,&#xD;
narrow windows on Christtnas evening, dressed&#xD;
in her best, with a spray of holly in her hair,&#xD;
watching listlessly the carriages that dashed&#xD;
by, and the pedestrians that filled the streets.&#xD;
Liddell had dined with them, and his present&#xD;
-one of the costly gift-books of the season-&#xD;
lay in her lap, but she hardly noticed it. Her&#xD;
languid eyes were on the street, when sudden-&#xD;
ly something occurred that took all the lan-&#xD;
guor out of them. A. figure came in sight, a&#xD;
face looked up at her, and she knew-she&#xD;
would have known in a thousand-Louis Ber-&#xD;
nard I There was no time for a word, or even&#xD;
a gesture, on either side. There was only&#xD;
time for a start, a gasp, a long, hungry look,&#xD;
and all was over. The young man passed on,&#xD;
and, the girl, turning from the window, came&#xD;
and sat down by the fire. Liddeil and her&#xD;
father were deep in plans of machinery-it&#xD;
was Mr. Gordon's only mode of recreation-&#xD;
and they paid little attention to her, so she&#xD;
leaned back in a corner quite silent, and the&#xD;
stream of mechanical talk flowed past her un-&#xD;
heeded. She caught a fragment of it now&#xD;
and then, but it bore little significance to her&#xD;
ear. She only knew that there was some&#xD;
point at issue between her father and the ma-&#xD;
chinist-some point there seemed no definite&#xD;
&#xD;
t mode of settling-and that Liddell proposed&#xD;
a to refer to some book of designs he had.&#xD;
a "I will send it over to-morrow," he said.&#xD;
a "You can examine it atyour leisure, and per-&#xD;
a haps Miss Annie will be good enough to take&#xD;
care of it for me. It is a very valuable book,&#xD;
and reliable, too. You will find this idea of&#xD;
the cylinder developed there in just the way I&#xD;
have' described. It was patented by Verdot in&#xD;
* '49."&#xD;
"I don't care whom it was patented by, it&#xD;
might be improved," said Mr. Gordon; and&#xD;
* so the discussion went on, until Liddell ended&#xD;
it by asking Annie to sing. She complied at&#xD;
once; and, after a reasonable number of songs,&#xD;
he rose to go. He had sufficient discretion&#xD;
not to obtrude the lover-like part of his r6le,&#xD;
and not to pay ~long visits; and his reward&#xD;
was Annie's constantly-increasing kindness.&#xD;
To-night she was so cold, absent and almost&#xD;
unapproachable, that he thought he must&#xD;
have offended her, for, of course, he could not&#xD;
know that it was the mere sight of Bernard&#xD;
that had turned her heart against him.&#xD;
"0 my poor love I" she was saying to her-&#xD;
self all the time, even when he came up to&#xD;
shake hands and bid her good-night.&#xD;
"Will you take care of my book?" he&#xD;
said, again, with a sort of wistful look in her&#xD;
face. "I should be very glad if you would,&#xD;
and if-and if you would make one of your&#xD;
beautiful drawings for me of Plate XL.? I&#xD;
want it for constant use, and I had rather&#xD;
havia one of your drawings than the finest en-&#xD;
graving in the world. Will you do it for me?"&#xD;
"Your taste is very bad, to prefer my&#xD;
drawing to an engraving," said Annie, grave-&#xD;
ly. "But, of course, I will do it for you if&#xD;
you want it. I have nothing else to do."&#xD;
"Thank you, and good-night."&#xD;
She gave him her hand and said good.&#xD;
night; but it was very' coldly, and he went&#xD;
away chilled, thinking almost that he would&#xD;
never succeed in winning her. As for Annie,&#xD;
she went up-stairs and cried for an hour or&#xD;
two before she sank to sleep. Weeping had&#xD;
latterly become quite a favorite amusement&#xD;
of hers, and the effect was any thing but bene-&#xD;
ficial to her personal appearance.&#xD;
The next day the book came, and, after&#xD;
her father had finished examiningit, he hand-&#xD;
ed it over to her keeping. It was a volume&#xD;
of mechanical designs, not very interesting to&#xD;
her; but she took it to a window, and began&#xD;
making preparations for copying Plate XL.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
She copied for some time, then grew tired,&#xD;
and, leaning her elbows on the table, care-&#xD;
lessly turned over the leaves. As she did so,&#xD;
a piece of paper fluttered out from between&#xD;
two of the pages, and fell to the floor. She&#xD;
stooped, picked it up, and was returning it to&#xD;
the book, when something about it attracted&#xD;
her attention. It was merely an ordinary&#xD;
piece of drawing-paper, on which was traced&#xD;
the ~ough outline of. a design. But the paper&#xD;
itself struck her as familiar. She had seen,&#xD;
she had handled it, she felt sure; and, on look-&#xD;
ing more closely, she found she was right, for&#xD;
in the corner her own private mark-a cu-&#xD;
riously-interlaced monogram of her name-&#xD;
was written with, ink. It was a sheet of her&#xD;
own paper, and had been taken from her own&#xD;
portfolio. This, which seemed at first sight a&#xD;
slight-enough mystery, puzzled her exceed-&#xD;
ingly. In consequence of her father's sus-&#xD;
picious fears, she always kept her portfolio&#xD;
carefully put away; and, as far as her own&#xD;
knowledge extended, no one, not even Ber-&#xD;
nard, had ever been permitted to examine it.&#xD;
How, then, had this paper, with her own mark&#xD;
upon it, been extracted therefrom? She&#xD;
looked at the design. That was certainly not&#xD;
of her drawing. She shook her head, and was&#xD;
about toput down the paper and dismiss the&#xD;
subject with. a "Very curious!" when a few&#xD;
faint, half-effaced lines on the back attracted&#xD;
her eye. She looked at these for a moment&#xD;
with her brows bent, then suddenly rose,&#xD;
pushed back the table, anti went nearer to the&#xD;
light. Even this, however, was not sufficient&#xD;
for what she wished to decipher, and she&#xD;
hastily took up a magnifying-glass. By the&#xD;
aid of this, she soon discerned that a design&#xD;
on the back of the paper had been carefully&#xD;
rubbed out, leaving only a few lines visible.&#xD;
These few lines, however, were to her of im-&#xD;
mense significance, for they showed her that&#xD;
the effaced drawing had been her own, and&#xD;
that it had been one of the designs of her fa-&#xD;
ther's invention.&#xD;
At this point her breath came fast, her&#xD;
hands trembled, her color varied evcry instant,&#xD;
and, if any one had been looking on, be would&#xD;
certainly have thought her beside herself with&#xD;
excitement. Still, she controlled this excite-&#xD;
ment, and, though she was tingling in every&#xD;
nerve with the importance of the discovery&#xD;
just made, went steadily on to follow it up as&#xD;
well as she could Thanks to the magnifying-&#xD;
glass, ~he soon found what she was now espe-&#xD;
&#xD;
cially in search of-a number in the corner of&#xD;
the sheet. When this was deciphered, she&#xD;
laid the paper down and left the room, return-&#xD;
ing in an instant with her portfolio. Now it&#xD;
chanced that, having been trained by a man,&#xD;
she had much of masculine precision about&#xD;
her, and in the different pockets of this re-&#xD;
ceptacle were carefully numbered and filed&#xD;
away, in their proper order of date, the designs&#xD;
she had made for the now useless invention.&#xD;
Owing to the number she had just deciphered&#xD;
on the effaced drawing, she knew exactly where&#xD;
to look for the information needed to verify&#xD;
her suspicions. Opening the portfolio with&#xD;
qnivering fingers, she drew forth the contents&#xD;
of a certain pocket, and ran over the num-&#xD;
bers. For three or four sheets, all was regn.&#xD;
lar and in order; then, suddenly, she stopped,&#xD;
and again caught her breath. There was a&#xD;
break. Hastily she went on to the end and&#xD;
then came back, looked again, examined again,&#xD;
'and finally raised her face with a half4right.&#xD;
ened assurance on it-three sheets were missiny!&#xD;
and one of Chose 8keets she held in her hand.&#xD;
For a moment the conviction almost stunned&#xD;
her. Mr. Gordon was right, then! The idea&#xD;
~had been stolen. Up to this time she had be.&#xD;
lived with ]~ernard that it was a singular but&#xD;
entirely accidentalcoincidence of thought. Now&#xD;
she knew it had been a robbery. But a rob-&#xD;
bery made by whom ~ She was too young and&#xD;
inexperienced to be able to answer this ques-&#xD;
tion. Those who have never known treachery&#xD;
are slow to suspect, and slower yet to believe&#xD;
it. The stars might have fallen before she&#xD;
would have creditedBernard's guilt, and she&#xD;
was almost as unwilling to attach even a mo-&#xD;
ment's suspicion to Liddell. Yet, plainly, the&#xD;
matter lay between those two. No one else&#xD;
had even possible access to her portfolio, and&#xD;
the possession of that sheet, the effaced de-&#xD;
sign, the whole array of circumstances, all&#xD;
seemed to point-&#xD;
She paused and sat down, faint and shud-&#xD;
dering. Treachery seemed to come so near,&#xD;
to touch her so closely, when it was brought&#xD;
home in this way to amsn~ whom she had liked,&#xD;
respected, trusted, almost promised to marry I&#xD;
It was all a hideous seeming; it could not be,&#xD;
she cried out-yet, even as she exclaimed&#xD;
thus, there came to her a memory which would&#xD;
not be put asido~ She remembered a certain&#xD;
evening in the early spring, when she had been&#xD;
drawing in the arbor, how Bernard had come&#xD;
in upon her, and she carelessly left her port..&#xD;

folio on the table and strolled with him to th&#xD;
other end of the garden. She remembered&#xD;
that, when she came into the house, her Lathe&#xD;
told her that Liddell had been sent to th&#xD;
arbor by him, but failed to find her, and shi&#xD;
also remembered-good Heavens, how clear&#xD;
lyl-that, on opening her portfolio, she ha~&#xD;
found several things strangely out of place&#xD;
though she never once thought of looking a&#xD;
the designs. What if this meant-what if F&#xD;
proved- But heye the full nature of the dis&#xD;
cover came over her so strongly that, but fo&#xD;
the recollection of Bernard, she would hav(&#xD;
thrust away the tell-tale paper, and nevei&#xD;
thought again of the dark suspicion it had&#xD;
brought forth. As it was, however, she could&#xD;
not do this. His face, as she had seen it only&#xD;
the evening before, rose up before her, and&#xD;
seemed bidding her clear his name. He could&#xD;
do nothing for himself; but, if indeed she held&#xD;
the means to prove his innocence, should she&#xD;
fail to use it? IC Liddell was guilty, surely&#xD;
his double treachery-treachery to Bernard,&#xD;
as well as to her father-deserved to suffer&#xD;
the penalty of detection; and, if he was inno-&#xD;
cent, an explanation could not harm him. At&#xD;
all risks, she was determined to go on-to fol-&#xD;
low the path thus unexpectedly opened for&#xD;
her. Whhout giving herself time to think, she&#xD;
seized a pen and wrote a short note-the first&#xD;
in eight long months-to Bernard:&#xD;
"Dz4ui Louis: Forgive me that I write to&#xD;
you. I only do so, because I have made a dis.&#xD;
cover which, it seems to me, you ought to&#xD;
know, and which may be of importance to&#xD;
you. What it is, you shall hear when we meet.&#xD;
I must, however, ask one question. Am I right&#xD;
in supposing that Mr. Liddell was the original&#xD;
possessor of the invention which you patented,&#xD;
and that it was he who brought the design to&#xD;
you? If so, do not hesitate to come here this&#xD;
afternoon, and bring all his oi~iginal draughts&#xD;
with you. Yours ever,&#xD;
"ANNIE GonnoN."&#xD;
'~ About foui~ o'clock, that afternoon, there&#xD;
was a knock at Mr. Gordon's door, and, when&#xD;
Annie flew down from an ambuscade on the&#xD;
staircase and opened it, she stood face to face&#xD;
with Bernard. The young man stepped with-&#xD;
in the passage without a word, and the next&#xD;
moment would have taken the pretty porteress&#xD;
into his arms, if she had not drawn away, put&#xD;
tier finger to her lips, and beckoned him in&#xD;
&#xD;
e the direction of a certain odd little room which&#xD;
I no one but herself ever invaded. Once safely&#xD;
r inside this sanctuary, she turned and held out&#xD;
s her hands, saying:&#xD;
"0 Louis, you cannot tell how glad I am&#xD;
- toseeyouagain!"&#xD;
"And I you, my darling!" said Louis,&#xD;
warmly. But, after a minute, he went on more&#xD;
gravely: '~ 1 don't like this, Annie. I did not&#xD;
ku~w that I was to come here clandestinely.&#xD;
- I thought I was summoned openly."&#xD;
"And so you are, dear love," said Annie,&#xD;
eagerly; "only have a minute's patience. I&#xD;
want you to myself for a little while-I want&#xD;
to tell you everything, and then, if you say&#xD;
I so, I will take you to papa. Louis-answer&#xD;
me the question I asked in my note. Was it&#xD;
Mr. Liddell who brought you that invention ~"&#xD;
She came close to him, and asked the ques-&#xD;
tion breathlessly, her eyes full of excitement,&#xD;
and her voice fairly quivering. She felt how&#xD;
much depended on his answer, how one word&#xD;
might overthrow all her tower of fancied&#xD;
proof; and she trembled even while she waited&#xD;
eagerly to hear that answer. After a moment&#xD;
it came-very slowly:&#xD;
"I cannot answer that question, Annie,&#xD;
until I know why you ask it."&#xD;
"Tell me, then, if you have ever suspected&#xD;
that this man-whoever he was-might really&#xD;
have stolen the invention, and been playing&#xD;
you false?"&#xD;
Bernard looked disturbed, and tumbled&#xD;
his hair about in a way she well remembered&#xD;
before he answered.&#xD;
"It is hard to suspect a man," he said, at&#xD;
last; "and I have been the more loath to do&#xD;
it, since I myself have tasted the bitterness&#xD;
of undeserved suspicion. But, since you ask&#xD;
the question, I must confess that doubts have&#xD;
come to me, doubts that, despite myself; have&#xD;
grown stronger since-"&#xD;
He stopped abruptly, and Annie finished&#xD;
the sentence for him.&#xD;
"Since you heard that I was to marry Mr.&#xD;
Liddell. Oh, don't start! It was not so-I*&#xD;
am sure that I neverwould have done it-but&#xD;
that is what you meant, and now I know that&#xD;
he was the man. Stop, don't say any thing,&#xD;
Louis.-Look at this."&#xD;
She put the drawing and the magnifying-&#xD;
glass into his hand, telling him, at the same&#xD;
time, how she had obtained the former. His&#xD;
eager astonishment was even greater than she&#xD;
had expected. It fairly startled her, as he&#xD;
&#xD;
I.&#xD;

@3&#xD;
a&#xD;
u&#xD;
@3&#xD;
&#xD;
turned, full of breathless impatience, and bade&#xD;
her tell him all-every thing. Necessarily, it&#xD;
did not take her long to do this, since the&#xD;
"every thing" was in itself very little. Then&#xD;
he caught her in his arms and kissed her as he&#xD;
kissed her on that April day when he came&#xD;
upon her with the news of his good fortune.&#xD;
"You have saved me?" he cried, "You&#xD;
have given me the evidence I could never have&#xD;
gained for myself; you have cleared my name,&#xD;
and made me a free man once more. 0 Annie,&#xD;
Annie, how can I ev~er love you enough?"&#xD;
"It is true, then?" she cried. "Was it&#xD;
indeed he? 0 Louis, I can hardly believe it!&#xD;
Oh, dear love, how could he be so wicked?"&#xD;
"I have no doubt it was principally be-&#xD;
cauSe he wanted to take y~u from me," said&#xD;
the young man, all in a glo~v. " But, however&#xD;
that may be, it was Liddell himself and no&#xD;
other, who brought me this invention as his&#xD;
own. See, Annie, I have done as you bade&#xD;
me-I have brought his original draughts, and&#xD;
we will show them, and this effaced drawing,&#xD;
to your father. Do you think be will believe&#xD;
me then?"&#xD;
"Heaven only knows-but we will go and&#xD;
see."&#xD;
Without giving their courage time to ebb,&#xD;
they gathered together the papers and crossed&#xD;
the passage to Mr. Gordon's room. When&#xD;
Annie knocked, her father's voice bade her&#xD;
"Come in," and, when she opened the door,&#xD;
she found, to her consternation-for she had&#xD;
neither planned nor wished any thing half so&#xD;
dramatic-that Liddell was with him.&#xD;
There was a moment's pause~on both sides&#xD;
-a pause of surprised and awkward uncer-&#xD;
tainty-before Mr. Gordon rose and addressed&#xD;
his daughter, his face flushing with anger, and&#xD;
his voice trembling with indignation.&#xD;
"What is the meaning of this, Annie?&#xD;
how dare you insult me by bringing that-&#xD;
that thief into my presence?"&#xD;
Now Annie had not meant to speair-t'nat&#xD;
was to have been Bernard's part-but this&#xD;
address naturally roused her, and, before the&#xD;
former could interfere, she had answered:&#xD;
"Mr. Bernard is here at my request, papa.&#xD;
He wished to answer the charge whicl~ you&#xD;
made against him eight months ago. It is&#xD;
now in his power to prove his innocence."&#xD;
"Let him take the proofs of it elsewhere,&#xD;
then," said her father, coldly. "I have no in-&#xD;
terest in him or in them."&#xD;
"What! you refuse to hear him?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, I refuse to hear him. I have no&#xD;
desire to be duped by him again. I tell you&#xD;
what I told you eight months ago-choose&#xD;
between him and me. If you take him you&#xD;
lose me-that is all.-Mr. Liddell, shall we go&#xD;
on now with our business?"&#xD;
Annie looked hopelessly at Bernard, but&#xD;
Bernard did not return the glaiice. On the&#xD;
contrary, he stepped quietly forward, and laid&#xD;
his papers on the table.&#xD;
"Since you refuse to receive any proofs&#xD;
of my innocence,~t he said, addressing Mr.&#xD;
Gordon, with calm dignity, "I must ask you&#xD;
to examine these evidences of another man's&#xD;
guilt. You may remember that I spoke of a&#xD;
person from whom I received the original in.-&#xD;
vention. In tbese papers you will find suffi.&#xD;
cient proof where he obtained it2'&#xD;
Mr. Gordon looked up. Apparently he&#xD;
was about to answer as he had done before,&#xD;
but something in the steady eyes of Bernard&#xD;
changed his purpose. He extended his hand&#xD;
and took the papers-hesitated a moment, and&#xD;
laid them down.&#xD;
"It is quite useless to bring me proofs&#xD;
against a man whose name I am not to know,"&#xD;
he said, frigidly. "He may be merely an ab-&#xD;
straction, invented to shield yourself."&#xD;
"You are mistaken," said Bernard, quiet-&#xD;
ly. "This man is no abstraction. He not&#xD;
only lives, but you know him intimately. In&#xD;
robbing you, he betrayed not only his own&#xD;
honor, but your friendship. Sir, examine&#xD;
these papers, and, when you have examined&#xD;
them, I will refer you to Mr. Liddell for the&#xD;
name of their author."&#xD;
Again there was a pause-a pause in which&#xD;
all of the four might have heard the beating&#xD;
of their own hearts; then, not quite unex-&#xD;
pectedly, Mr. Gordon broke forth, viQlently:&#xD;
"So, you come here to clear yourself by&#xD;
insulting my friend under my own roof?&#xD;
There is the door, sir I Never let me see&#xD;
your face in this house again! If I had ever&#xD;
doubted your guilt, I should be sure of it&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"rapa," cried Annie, suddenly springing&#xD;
forward, "you must-you shall hear him!&#xD;
This is more than unjust-it is outrageous !-&#xD;
it is what you have no right to do! As for&#xD;
Mr. Liddell, I dare him to look me in the face,&#xD;
and say that he is innocent! I dare bim to&#xD;
deny that he took three designs of the inven-&#xD;
tion from my portfolio, and that this is one&#xD;
of them!"&#xD;

BERNARD'S INVENTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
She laid her hand, as she spoke, on the&#xD;
erased drawing, and turned like a tragedy.&#xD;
queen upon the trembling man, who was&#xD;
forced to clutch a corner of the table, to save&#xD;
himself from falling. In exactly the same&#xD;
spot where Bernard. had stood eight months&#xD;
before, when Mr. Gordon accused and con-&#xD;
demned him, the really guilty man stood now,&#xD;
and strove in vain to steady himself-atrove&#xD;
in vain to speak. Mr. Gordon was about to&#xD;
answer his daughter as he had already an.&#xD;
swered Bernard, when his eye followed hers,&#xD;
and, falling on Liddell, he stood confounded,&#xD;
and could not utter a word. Indeed, he&#xD;
gasped for breath, and felt for a moment as&#xD;
if the solid earth was sliding from beneath his&#xD;
feet. He was glad, just then, that Bernard&#xD;
placed a chair, and said, in something of his&#xD;
old voice, "Sit down, sir." Unconsciously he&#xD;
sat down, and, as he did so, Liddell looked up&#xD;
and spoke-hoarsely and with effort:&#xD;
"You need not carry the thing any fur-&#xD;
ther, Bernard; I admit your proofs, and that&#xD;
is an end of the matter. I have no motive&#xD;
for concealment now. Mr. Gordon might be-&#xD;
lieve me, but she "-he nodded toward Annie,&#xD;
but did not look at her-" is all on your side.&#xD;
I don't mind saying that I did it to win her&#xD;
&#xD;
from you, and, of course, I don't care about&#xD;
putting a bold face on it after-after what&#xD;
she has said. It was a dishonorabid thing, I&#xD;
suppose; but it may be some excuse to say&#xD;
that I cared nothing about the money. I did&#xD;
it simply to get rid of you, ~ndi think I would&#xD;
do it over again, with any hope of success.&#xD;
You may as well throw those papers into the&#xD;
fire, and you need not trouble yourself to pay&#xD;
any more of the profits to my account. I&#xD;
have touched my last dollar of the money;&#xD;
and the only regret I have in the affair, is-&#xD;
that this is all my fault."&#xD;
With that, he turned and left the room&#xD;
-not one of the three uttering 'a word. Mr.&#xD;
Gordon was too much aghast; Annie was too&#xD;
full of indignation; and Bernard, who was&#xD;
now master of the situation' felt too much&#xD;
contempt. So he went out in silence-an ob-&#xD;
ject more fit for pity than scorn; and, when&#xD;
the trio left behind looked at each other, they&#xD;
forgot him and all that he had caused them to&#xD;
suffer, in their sudden realization of happi-&#xD;
ness-happiness that had come as a free,&#xD;
bounteous gift from the same gracious Hand&#xD;
that can scatter the darkest clouds in a mo-&#xD;
ment, and bring forth the golden sunlight un-&#xD;
dimmed.&#xD;
