The undersigned, having purchased the copyright of the "Life and Adventures of&#xD;
Joaquin Murieta," deem it proper to preface this publication of this latest edition&#xD;
by some brief mention of the lamented author, JoHN R. RIDGE, who was a Chero-&#xD;
kee Indian. His Indian name was Chee-squa-tah-lo-uee, which, being interpreted&#xD;
into English, is "Yellow Bird," and this name, which the reader will perceive is not&#xD;
a fictitious signature, was that adopted by Mr. Ridge in the title page of most of his&#xD;
works. The father of Yellow Bird was' a Chief, his mother a white woman, a na-&#xD;
tive of Connebticut, in which State she married the young Chief, he being at the&#xD;
time at the institution of Cornwall, where he had just finished his English educa.&#xD;
tion. When Yellow Bird was ten years of age his father was assassinated, at the&#xD;
instigation of a rival Chief, and his mother fled with her children from the Indian&#xD;
territory. Yellow Bird was sent to school in Massachusetts. At the age of seven,&#xD;
teen he returned to the Cherokee Nation, which had been ever since his father's&#xD;
death the scene of fierce contentions between rival factions. In these contests,.&#xD;
which were bloody, the young man niingled, with varied fortune, until the age of&#xD;
twenty-three, when, his patrimony being wasted in the struggle and the scale turn.&#xD;
ing against him, the power of his father's enemies being too firmly secured to be&#xD;
shaken without a strong military force with which to operate against them, and he&#xD;
being himself hunted from pillar to post by the stronger party, he turned his steps&#xD;
once more to California. Doubtless he cherished still some plrn for obtaining what&#xD;
he considered his -just rights in the Cherokee Nation, but what they are none now&#xD;
can tell. His sudden death, while he was yet in the full vigor of manhood, took&#xD;
him away from many unfinished and long-cherished plans. In California his career&#xD;
was a literary and political one, and many of his poems will always remain as&#xD;
an enduring portion of American literature. , Before. his death he had prepared a&#xD;
revised edition of his story of Joaquin Murieta, to which he had added much new&#xD;
and heretofore unpublished material. The manuscript has been purchased by the&#xD;
undersigned. and with the following preface, written by the author for this -edition,&#xD;
the narrative Is laid before the public.&#xD;

AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE PRESENT EDITION.&#xD;
The continued and steady demand for the "Life and Adventures of Joaquin Mu-&#xD;
rieta" induces the author to issue a third edition, revised and enlarged, according to&#xD;
the scope of additional facts, the knowledge of which has been acquired since the&#xD;
publication of preceding editions. This would seem to be the more necessary, as a&#xD;
matter of justice both to the author and the public, inasmuch as a spurious edition&#xD;
has been foisted -apon unsuspecting publishers and by them circulated, to the in-&#xD;
fringement of the 'author's copyright and the damage of his literary credit-the&#xD;
spurious work, with its crude interpolations, fictitious additions and imperfectly din-&#xD;
guised distortions of the author's phraseology, being by many persons confounded&#xD;
with the original performance.&#xD;

Sitting down, as Inow do, to give to&#xD;
the public such events of the life of Joa-&#xD;
quin Murieta as have come into my pos-&#xD;
session, I am moved by no desire to ad-&#xD;
minister to any depraved taste for the&#xD;
dark and horrible inhuman action, but&#xD;
rather by a wish to contribute my mite&#xD;
to those materials out of which the early&#xD;
history of California shall be composed.&#xD;
Aside from the interest naturally excited&#xD;
by the career of a man so remarkable in&#xD;
the annals of crime-for in deeds of dar-&#xD;
ing and blood he has never been exceed-&#xD;
ed by any of the renowned robbers of the&#xD;
Old or New World who have preceded&#xD;
him-his character is well worth the&#xD;
scrutiny of the intelligent reader as being&#xD;
a product of the social and moral condi-&#xD;
tion of the country in which he lived,&#xD;
while his individual record becomes a&#xD;
part of the most valuable, because it is a&#xD;
part of the earliest history of the State.&#xD;
We must here premise that there ex-&#xD;
.isted another Joaquin, contemporaneous-&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
A,&#xD;
&#xD;
ly with the subject of this narrative, who&#xD;
bore the several titles of O'Comorenia,&#xD;
Valenzuela, Botellier and Carillo. His&#xD;
true surname was Valenzuela, and he&#xD;
was a distinguished subordinate of Joa-&#xD;
quin Murieta. He used, however, by&#xD;
many persons to be mistaken, for his&#xD;
chief ; and certain individuals who knew&#xD;
him simply as "Joaquin, " and who saw&#xD;
him after the announcement of Murieta's&#xD;
death, insisted with great pertinacity&#xD;
that the terrible bandit was still alive.&#xD;
Joaquin Murieta was' a Mexican of&#xD;
good blood, borne in the province of 86-&#xD;
nora, of respectable parents, ,and edu-&#xD;
cated to a degree sufficient for the coin-&#xD;
mon purposes of life in the schools of his&#xD;
native country. While growing up, he&#xD;
was remarkable for a very mild and&#xD;
peaceable disposition, and gave no sign&#xD;
of that indomitable and daring spirit&#xD;
which  afterwards characterized him.&#xD;
Those who knew him in his school-boy&#xD;
days speak affectionately of his generous&#xD;
and noble nature at that period of his&#xD;
life, and can scarcely credit the fact, that&#xD;
the renowned and bloody bandit of Cali-&#xD;
fornia was one and the same being.&#xD;
The first considerable interruption in&#xD;
the general smooth current, of his exist-&#xD;
ence, occurred in the latter portion of his&#xD;
seventeenth year. Near the rancho of,&#xD;
his father resided a "packer," one Feliz,&#xD;
who, as ugly as sm itself, had a daughter&#xD;
named Rosita. Her mother was dead,&#xD;
and she, although but sixteen, was bur-&#xD;
dened with the responsibility of a hovse-&#xD;

Rosita, though in humble circumstances&#xD;
was of Castilian descent, and showed he&#xD;
superior origin in the' native royalty o&#xD;
her look and general dignity of her bear&#xD;
ing. Yet she was of that voluptuous&#xD;
order to which so many of the dark-eyed&#xD;
daughters of Spain belong, and the ric&#xD;
blood of her race mounted to cheeks, lips&#xD;
and eyes. i Her father doted upon and&#xD;
was proud of her, andit was his greatest&#xD;
happiness, on returning from occasional&#xD;
packing expeditions through the moun-&#xD;
tains of Sonora (he was simply employed&#xD;
by a more wealthy individual) to receive&#xD;
the gentle ministries of his gay ~and&#xD;
smiling daughter: Joaquin having noth-&#xD;
ing to do but ride hisfather's horses, and&#xD;
give a general superintendence to the&#xD;
herding of stock upon the rancho, was&#xD;
frequently a transient caller at the cabin&#xD;
of Feliz, more particularly when the old&#xD;
man was absent, making excuses for a&#xD;
drink ofwater or somesuch matter, and&#xD;
prolonging-his stay for the purpose of&#xD;
an -agreeable chit-chat with the by no&#xD;
means backward damsel. She had read&#xD;
of bright and handsome lovers, in the&#xD;
stray romances of the day, and well in-&#xD;
terpreted, no doubt, the mutual emotions&#xD;
of loving hearts. Indeed Nature herself&#xD;
is a sufficient instructor, without the aid&#xD;
of books, where tropic fire is in the veins,&#xD;
and slowing health runs hand in hand&#xD;
with the imagination. It was no wonder,&#xD;
then, that the youthful Joaquin and the&#xD;
precocious and blooming Rosita, in the&#xD;
absence, on each side, of all other like&#xD;
objects of attraction, should begin to feel&#xD;
the preserce of each other as a necessity.&#xD;
They loved- warmly and passionately.&#xD;
The packer being absent more than half&#xD;
the time,' there. was every opportunity&#xD;
for the youthful pair to meet, and their&#xD;
intercourse was, with the exception of&#xD;
the occasional intrusion of her brother&#xD;
Reyes, a mere boy, absolutely without&#xD;
&#xD;
or restraint. Rosita was one of those&#xD;
e  beings who yield all for love, and, ere,&#xD;
C- she tobk time to consider of her duties to&#xD;
n. society, to herself, or to her father,t she&#xD;
s, found herself in the situation of a mere&#xD;
r  mistress to Joaquin. Old Felia broke in&#xD;
f  at last, upon their felicity,-by a chance&#xD;
-  discovery, Coming home one day from,&#xD;
s  a protracted tour in the mountains, he&#xD;
d  found no one in the cabin but his son&#xD;
Reyes,' who told him that Rosita and&#xD;
s  Joaquin had gone out together on the&#xD;
path leading up the'little stream-that&#xD;
t  ran past the dwelling. Following p&#xD;
the path indicated, the old man came&#xD;
upon the, pair, in a position,' as  yron&#xD;
has it in the most diabolical ofhIris&#xD;
works, "loving, natural and Greek."n&#xD;
1 His rage knew no bounds, but Joaquin&#xD;
did not tarry for its effects. On the con-&#xD;
trary, he fled precipitately from  'the&#xD;
scene. Whether he showed a piiper&#xD;
regard for the fair Rosita in so doing, it&#xD;
is not our province to discuss. All.We&#xD;
have to do is to state what occurred,&#xD;
and leave moral discrepancies to be har.&#xD;
monized as they best may. At any'rate,&#xD;
the loving girl never blamed him for&#xD;
his conduct, for she took the earliest op-&#xD;
-portunity of a moonlight night, to seek&#xD;
him-at his father's rancho, and throw&#xD;
herself into his arms.&#xD;
About this time, Joaquin had received&#xD;
a letter from a half brother of his, who&#xD;
had been a short time  in California, ad-&#xD;
vising him by all means to hasten to&#xD;
that region of romantic adventure and&#xD;
golden reward. He was not long in Pre,&#xD;

side upon another, and with a couple of&#xD;

provisions and necessaries, he started for&#xD;

tended with no serious difficulties, and&#xD;
the trip was made with expedition.&#xD;
The first that we hear of him in the&#xD;
Golden State is that in the spring of 1850,&#xD;
he is engaged in the honest occupation&#xD;
of a miner in the Stanislaus placers, then&#xD;

ito a beingof a different nature, andher-&#xD;
self seizing the knife, she made a venge-&#xD;

fury in her eye and vengeance in her&#xD;
spring, but what could a tender female&#xD;
accomplish, against such ruffians ? She&#xD;
was seized by her tender wrists, easily&#xD;
disarmed, and thrown fainting and help-&#xD;
less upon the bed. Meantime Joaquin&#xD;
had been bound hand and foot, by others&#xD;
of the party, and, lying in that condition&#xD;
he saw the cherished companion of his&#xD;
bosom deliberately violated by these&#xD;
very superior specimens of the much&#xD;
-vaunted Anglo-Saxon race!&#xD;
Leaving him in his agony, they gave&#xD;
him to understand that, if he was found&#xD;
in that cabin, or upon his claim after the&#xD;
expiration of the neIt ten days, they&#xD;
would take his life. The soul of the&#xD;
young man was from that moment dark-.&#xD;
ened, and, as he himself related after-&#xD;
wards, he swore, with clenched hands,&#xD;
as his mistress unbound him, that he&#xD;
would live for revenge. She, weeping,&#xD;
Implored him to live for Jer, as he knew&#xD;
she only lived for him, and try to forget&#xD;
iW some other and happier scene the bit-&#xD;
ter-misery of the present. He was lre-&#xD;

portion of the mines.&#xD;
The next we hear of them, they are&#xD;
located on a nice little farm on the banks&#xD;
of a beautiful stream that watered a fer-&#xD;
tile valley far out in the seclusion of the&#xD;
mountains of Calaveras. Here the some-&#xD;
what saddened adventurer deemed that&#xD;
he might .hope for peace and again be&#xD;
happy. But it was not so destined.&#xD;
One day, as le was engaged with axe&#xD;
and mattock in clearing his ground, sev-&#xD;
eial-Americans rode up to the fencing of&#xD;
his little rett-eat, and notified him that&#xD;
they allowed no infernal Mexidan intrud-&#xD;
ers, like hin, to own land in that sec-&#xD;
tion. Joaquin's blood boiled in his veins,&#xD;
but he answered wildly that the valley&#xD;
was unoccupied save by himself, that he&#xD;
&#xD;
acknowledgedallegiance to the Ameri-&#xD;
can Government, that the treaty of peace&#xD;
between the United Statesand Mexico&#xD;
gave him his choice of citizenship either&#xD;
in California or in Mexico as he liked,&#xD;
that he had been already driven from,&#xD;
the mines without any erime or offence&#xD;
on his part, and allhe now asked was -a&#xD;
very small patch of ground and the shel.&#xD;
ter of a humble home for himself and&#xD;
"wife." He was peremptorily told to&#xD;
leave, and, we blush to say it, com.&#xD;
pelled to abandon the spot he had se-&#xD;
lected and the fruits of his labor.&#xD;
It is honorable to him to say that his&#xD;
spirit was still unbroken, nor had the,&#xD;
iron so far entered his soul as to sear up&#xD;
the innate sensitiveness to honor and'&#xD;
right which reigned in his bosom. Twice,&#xD;
ruined in his honest pursuit of fortune,&#xD;
he resolved still to labor on with unflinch-&#xD;
ing- brow  and with that true moral&#xD;
bravery which throws, its redeeming&#xD;
light forward upon all his subseqimatly&#xD;
dark and criminal career. How deep&#xD;
must have been the anguish of that&#xD;
young heart, and how strongly rooted&#xD;
the native honesty of his soul, none can,&#xD;
know or imagine but they that have been&#xD;
tried in like manner.&#xD;
- He bundled up his little moveable&#xD;
property, and again started forth to&#xD;
strike once more, like a braveand-&#xD;
honest man, for fortune and for happi-&#xD;
ness. He arrived at Murphy's Diggings,&#xD;
in Calaveras County; in the month of&#xD;
April, 1850, and went again to mining,&#xD;
this time- without interruption; but&#xD;
meeting' with nothing like his former&#xD;
success, he soon abandoned that 'busi-&#xD;
ness, and devoted his time to dealing&#xD;
"monte," a game which is common in&#xD;
Mexico, and had been almost universally&#xD;
adopted by gamblers in Mexico. It is&#xD;
considered by the Mexican in no manner&#xD;
a disreputable employment, and many&#xD;
well-reared young men from the Atlan.&#xD;
tic States have resorted to it, in time&#xD;
past, as a "profession " in this land of&#xD;
luck and chances. It was once in much&#xD;

&#xD;
better odor than it is now, although it&#xD;
is at present a game which may be&#xD;
played on very fair ad honest principles,,&#xD;
provided anything can be strictly honest&#xD;
or fair which allows the taking of money&#xD;
without a valuable consideration in re-&#xD;
turn. It was therefore looked upon as&#xD;
-o- departure from rectitude on the part&#xD;
of Joaquin, when he commenced the&#xD;
dealing of " moute." Having a very&#xD;
pleasing extdior and being, despite of all&#xD;
his sorrows, very gay and lively in his&#xD;
disposition, he attracted many persons&#xD;
to his table, and won their money with&#xD;
such skill and grace, or lost his own&#xD;
with such perfect good humor, that he&#xD;
-was considered by all the very beau ideal&#xD;
of a gambler and the prince of clever fel-&#xD;
lows.  His sky seemed clear and his&#xD;
prospects bright, but Fate was weaving&#xD;
her mysterious **eb around him, and&#xD;
fitting him by the force of circumstances&#xD;
to become what nature never intended&#xD;
'he should be.&#xD;
His half brother, of whom we have&#xD;
spoken, resided on a small tract of land&#xD;
in the vicinity of Murphy's Diggings.&#xD;
Joaquin had paid him a visit, ad. re-&#xD;
turned to the Diggings on a horse bor-&#xD;
rowed from lis brother. The animal,&#xD;
-which his brother had bought and paid&#xD;
his money for, proved  to have been&#xD;
originally 'stolen, and being recognized&#xD;
by a number of individuals in town, as&#xD;
well as by the owner, a stout rough.&#xD;
grained man, named J-s, an excitement&#xD;
was raised on the subject. Joaquin s'ud-&#xD;
denly found himself surrounded by a&#xD;
furious mob, many of them strangers io&#xD;
him, who were by no means sparing, o&#xD;
their threats and insults&#xD;
"So ray covey," said J-s, laying hi&#xD;
band on Joaquin's shoulder, "you ar&#xD;
the chap that's been a stealing horse&#xD;
and mules around here, for the last si&#xD;
months, are you?" -     -&#xD;
"You charge me unjustly," replied&#xD;
Joaquin. "I borrowed this horse of m3&#xD;
half brother. who bought it from at&#xD;
&#xD;
L1&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
American, which he can easily prove, as&#xD;
well',ns show a bill of sale besides.&#xD;
" This is all gammon," said 3-s " and&#xD;
you are nothing but a dirty thief."&#xD;
"Hang him!" "Hang him I" cried&#xD;
out several voices from the crowd, and the&#xD;
young Mexican was at once seized and&#xD;
bound. Some one, more moderate than&#xD;
the rest, suggested that it would be bet-&#xD;
ter, before proceeding to extremities, to&#xD;
see what the half brother had to say for&#xD;
himself.-&#xD;
"Yes, nab hin too I" exclaimed vari-&#xD;
ous persons in the mob, and they at once&#xD;
started for the half brother's house,'tak-&#xD;
ing their prisoner along with them.&#xD;
" All I want you to do, gentlemen,"&#xD;
said Joaquin, "is to give my brother a&#xD;
chance to provp hi A d my innocence,&#xD;
Let him have time to sut" on .hi wit-&#xD;
nesses."&#xD;
This remark was oly. answered with&#xD;
jeers and contempt.  p4rv ing at the&#xD;
place sought for, the, brother of Joaquin&#xD;
being readily found, he was seized, with&#xD;
scarcely a word of explanation, hurried&#xD;
to a tree and swung by the neck, amid&#xD;
the hootings of the mob, until he was&#xD;
dead.  Joaquin shed tears of agony at&#xD;
-the sight, and begged that they would&#xD;
proceed at once to deal out the same fate&#xD;
to him. But the original intention, with&#xD;
regard to him, ,was changed, by some&#xD;
sudden revulsion of feeling in the crowd,&#xD;
and a far more humiliating punishment&#xD;
inflated. The unhappy young man was&#xD;
bound to the same tree upon which the&#xD;
lifeless form of his brother was swinging,&#xD;
and publicly disgraced with the lash. An&#xD;
eye-witness of this scene declared to the&#xD;
author that he never saw such an ex-&#xD;
s pression ir all his life as at this moment&#xD;
passed over the face of Joaquin. He cast&#xD;
a look of unutterable scorn and scowl-&#xD;
x  ing hate uponhis torturers, and meas-&#xD;
ured them fromhead to foot, as thoughhe&#xD;
d would imprint their likenesses upon his&#xD;
y memory forever. In grim silence h re-&#xD;

groan.  The deed being over andiis&#xD;
hands unbound, he resumed thgarb&#xD;
which had been stripped from his shoul-&#xD;
ders, and was left alone with his dead'&#xD;
brother.&#xD;
Who can tell the piercing grief of his&#xD;
now'desolate heart, and the tempest of&#xD;
angled wrath and woe which swept&#xD;
over him as he lowered the dead form of&#xD;
his brother, and, with the few friends&#xD;
who came to his assistance, proceeded to&#xD;
pay him the last sad rites of rude and&#xD;
humble sepulture? - Standing over the&#xD;
grave.of his last and dearest relative, he&#xD;
swore an oath of the most awful solem-&#xD;
nity, that his soul should never know&#xD;
peace until his hands were dyeddeep in&#xD;
the blood of his enemies I Fearfully did&#xD;
he keep that oath, as the following pages&#xD;
will show.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
A CHANGE IN JOAQUIN'S CHARACTER-&#xD;
MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCEs--MUR-&#xD;
DERS 'UPON THE HIGHWAY-AN OR-&#xD;
GANIZED BANDITTI-RANCHES LOSE&#xD;
THEIR STOCK-THE KILLING OF THE&#xD;
DEPUTY SHERIFF OF SANTA CLARA&#xD;
COUNTY - ENCOUNTER WITH THE&#xD;
BANDITS BY THE SHERIFF OF YUBA&#xD;
COUNTY.&#xD;
A change came over the. character of&#xD;
Joaquin,suddenlyandirrevocably. Wan-&#xD;
ton cruelty and the tyranny of prejudice&#xD;
had reached their climax. The soul of&#xD;
the injured man grew dark, and the bar-&#xD;
riers of honor, rocked into atoms by the&#xD;
strong passions which shook his heart&#xD;
like an earthquake,crumbled around him.&#xD;
Ile was no. more the genial, generous,&#xD;
open-hearted Murieta, as of yore. He&#xD;
walked apart in moody silence, avoided&#xD;
all intercourse with Americans and was&#xD;
seen to ride Qff into the mountains in&#xD;
company with such of his countrymn~p&#xD;
as he had never before condescended to&#xD;
be associated with.&#xD;
&#xD;
dt was not long before an Americamr&#xD;
was found dead in-the vicinity of Mur-&#xD;
phy's Diggings, having been almost liter-&#xD;
ally cutto pieces with a knife. Althougln&#xD;
horribly angled, he wasrecognized as-&#xD;
one of the mob engaged in the whip-,&#xD;
ping of Joaquin and the hapging of his-&#xD;
brother.&#xD;
A doctor, passing in the neighborhood&#xD;
of this murder, was met shortly after-,&#xD;
ward, by two men on horseback, who-&#xD;
fired their revolvers at him, but, owing-&#xD;
to his speed on foot, and the unevenness&#xD;
of the ground, he succeeded in escaping&#xD;
with no further injury than having a bul-&#xD;
leti shot through his hat, within an&#xD;
inch of the top of his head!  A panio&#xD;
spread among the rash    individuals&#xD;
who had composed that mob, and they&#xD;
were afraid to stir out on their ordinary&#xD;
business. . Whenever any one of them-&#xD;
strayed out of sight of his camp,.&#xD;
or ventured to travel on, the high-&#xD;
way, he was shot down suddenly aid&#xD;
mysteriously. Report after report came&#xD;
into the villages that Americans had been.&#xD;
found dead on the highways, having been&#xD;
either shot or stabbed, and it wAs invaria-&#xD;
bly discovered for many weeks, that the-&#xD;
murdered men belbnged to the mob who,&#xD;
had outraged Joaquin. It was fearful&#xD;
and it was strange, to see "how swiftly&#xD;
and mysteriously those men disappeared.&#xD;
J-s, the'owner of the horse which had&#xD;
been the occasion of the mob, was among&#xD;
the missing, but whether he slid off for&#xD;
distant parts, in fear of his life, or fell a&#xD;
victim to the wrath of the avenger, I&#xD;
have never learned. Certainit is that&#xD;
Murieta's revenge was very nearly com-&#xD;
plete. Said an eye witness of these&#xD;
events, (an acquaintance of mine, named&#xD;
Burns,) in reply to an inquiry which I&#xD;
addressed him:&#xD;
'I am inclined to think Joaquin wiped&#xD;
out the most of those prominently en-&#xD;
gaged in whipping him."&#xD;
Thus far, who can blame him? But&#xD;
the iron had entered too deeply into his&#xD;
soul for him to stop here. Ile had con-&#xD;
&#xD;
treated a hatred for the whole American&#xD;
race, and was deeinined to shed"their&#xD;
blood, whenever and wherever an oppor-&#xD;
tunity occurred. It was no time now,&#xD;
for him to retrace his steps. He had^&#xD;
committed deeds which made him amen-&#xD;
able to the law, and'his only safety lay&#xD;
in a persistence in the unlawful course&#xD;
which he had begun. It was necessary&#xD;
that he should have horses, and that he&#xD;
should have money. These he could not&#xD;
obtain except by robbery and murder,&#xD;
and thus he became an outlaw and a ban-&#xD;
dit on the verge of his nineteenth year.&#xD;
The year 1850 rolled away, marked&#xD;
with'the eventful history of the young&#xD;
man's wrongs and trials, his bitter re-&#xD;
venge on those who hadperpetrated the'&#xD;
crowning act of his deep injury and dis.&#xD;
grace; and, as it closed, it shut him away&#xD;
forever from his peace of mind and purity&#xD;
Of'heart.. He walled forth into the fu-&#xD;
ture a dark, determined' criminal, and&#xD;
all his proud nobility of soul, save in fit.&#xD;
ful gleams, existed only in memory.&#xD;
In 1851 it became generally known&#xD;
that an organized banditti were ranging&#xD;
the country; but it was not yet ascer-&#xD;
tained who was the leader. Travelers,,&#xD;
laden with the produce of the mines,&#xD;
were met upon the roads by well dressed&#xD;
men who politely requested them to&#xD;
"stand and deliver; " persons riding&#xD;
alone in the many, wild and lonesome re-&#xD;
gions, which form a large portion of this&#xD;
country, were skilfully noosed with the&#xD;
lasso, (which the Mexicans throw with&#xD;
great accuracy, being able thus to cap-&#xD;
ture wild cattle, elk, and sometimes even&#xD;
grizzly bears, upon the plains,) dragged&#xD;
from their saddles and murdered in the&#xD;
adjacent thickets. Horses of the finest&#xD;
mottle were stolen from the ranches,&#xD;
and, being racked up, were found in the&#xD;
possession of a determined band of men,&#xD;
ready to retain them at all hazards, and&#xD;
fully able to stand their ground.&#xD;
The scenes of murder and robbery&#xD;
shifted with the rapidity of lightning.&#xD;
At one time the northern counties would&#xD;
&#xD;
be suffering slaughters and depredations,&#xD;
at indther'the southern, and',before one&#xD;
would have imagined it possible, theeast&#xD;
and the west and eVery point of-the com-&#xD;
pass would be in trouble. There had&#xD;
been before this, neither in 1849'nor in&#xD;
1850, any such thing as an organized&#xD;
banditti, and it had been a matter of sur-&#xD;
prise to every one, since the countryy was&#xD;
so well adapted to a business of this kind&#xD;
-the houses scattered at such distances&#xD;
along the roads, the plains so level and&#xD;
open in which to ride with speed, and the&#xD;
mountains so rugged with their 'ten&#xD;
thousand fastnesses, in which to hide!&#xD;
Grass was abundant in the far-off valleys&#xD;
whichllay hidden in the rocky gorges,&#xD;
cool, delicious streams made music it the&#xD;
feet of the towering peaks, or came leap-&#xD;
ing down in gladness from their sides-&#xD;
game abounded on every hand, and nine&#xD;
unclouded months ofthe year made a&#xD;
climate so salubrious that nothing could&#xD;
be sweeter than a- day's rest under the&#xD;
tall pines, or a night's repose under the&#xD;
open canopy of heaven. Joaquin knew&#xD;
his advantages. His ~ superior intelli-&#xD;
gence and education gave him the re-&#xD;
spect of his comrades, and appealing to&#xD;
the prejudice against the "Yankees,"&#xD;
which the disastrous results of the Mex-&#xD;
ican 'war had not tended to lessen in&#xD;
their minds, he soon assembled around&#xD;
him a powerful band of his countrymen,&#xD;
who daily increased, as he ran his career&#xD;
of almost magical success. 'Among the&#xD;
number was Manuel Garcia, more fre-&#xD;
quently known as" Three fingeredick,"&#xD;
from the fact of his having had 'one of&#xD;
his fingers shot off in a skirmish with an&#xD;
American party during the Mexican war.&#xD;
He was' a man of unflinching bravery,&#xD;
but cruel and sanguinary. His form was&#xD;
large and rugged, and his countenance&#xD;
so fierce that few liked to look upon it.&#xD;
He was different from his more'youthful&#xD;
leader, in possessing nothing of his gener-&#xD;
ous, frank and cordial disposition, and&#xD;
in being utterly destitute of one merci-&#xD;
ful trait of humanity. His delight was&#xD;

JOAQULN .&amp;amp;URIETA.&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
in murder for its own diabolical sake,&#xD;
and-he gloated over the agonies of his,&#xD;
unoffendingvictims. He would sacrifice&#xD;
policy, the safety and interests of the&#xD;
band for the mere gratification of this&#xD;
murderous propensity, and it required&#xD;
all Joaquin's firmness and determination&#xD;
to hold him in check. The history of&#xD;
this monster was well known before he&#xD;
joined Joaquin. He was known to be the&#xD;
same man, who, in 1846, surrounded with&#xD;
his party two Americans, young men by&#xD;
the names of Cowie and Fowler, as they&#xD;
were traveling on the road between So-&#xD;
noma and Bodega, stripped them entire-&#xD;
ly naked, and, binding them each to a&#xD;
tree, slowly tortured them to death. He&#xD;
began by tllrowing knives at their bodies,&#xD;
as if he were practicing at a target ; he&#xD;
then cut out their tongues, punched out&#xD;
their eyes with his knife, gashed their&#xD;
bodies in numerous places, and, finally&#xD;
flaying them alive, left them to die. A&#xD;
thousand cruelties like these had he been&#xD;
guilty of, and long before Joaquin knew&#xD;
him'he was a hardened, experienced and&#xD;
detestable monster., When it was neces-&#xD;
sary for the young chief to commit some&#xD;
peculiarlyhogrible and cold-blooded mur-&#xD;
der, some deed of hellish ghastliness at&#xD;
which his soul revolted, he deputed this&#xD;
man to do it; and well was it executed,&#xD;
with certainty and to the letter.&#xD;
Another member was the boy, Reyes&#xD;
Feliz, whom I have before mentioned, as&#xD;
the brother of Rosita, and who wasleft by,&#xD;
his fugtive sister a year or so before in&#xD;
the province of Sonora. The old father,&#xD;
the Packer, was dead, and Reyes, hav-&#xD;
ing no ill-feeling whatever against Joa-&#xD;
quin and his sistei-, had hastened with&#xD;
the remnant of his father's property, to&#xD;
join them, and had arrived in California&#xD;
a few weeks after the affair of the mob at&#xD;
Murphy's Diggins. He was now a&#xD;
mere youth of sixteen years, buthhe had&#xD;
read the wild romantic lines of, the chiv-&#xD;
alrou s robbers of Spain and Mexico, un-&#xD;
til his enthusiastic spirit had become im-&#xD;
brued with the same sentiments which&#xD;
&#xD;
actuated them, and he could conceive of&#xD;
nothing grander than to throw himself&#xD;
back upon the strictly natural right o&#xD;
man and hurl defiance at society and its,&#xD;
laws. There isniany a villain nowadays,&#xD;
for the mere romance of the thing.&#xD;
Reyes Feliz was a devoted follower of&#xD;
his chief; like him, brave, impulsive,&#xD;
and generous.&#xD;
A third member was Claudio, a man&#xD;
about thirty-five years of age, of a lean,&#xD;
but, vigorous constitution, a dark com'&#xD;
plexion and possessing a somewhat sav-&#xD;
age but lively and expressive counten-&#xD;
ance. He was indisputably brave, but.&#xD;
exceedingly cautious and cunning,&#xD;
springing upon his prey at an unexpected&#xD;
moment and executing his purposes&#xD;
with the greatest possible secrecy as well&#xD;
as precision. He was a deep calculator,&#xD;
a wise schemer, and could wear the ap-&#xD;
pearance of an honest man with the&#xD;
same grace and ease that he would ex-&#xD;
hibit in throwing around his command.&#xD;
ing figure the magnificent cloak ir4&#xD;
which he prided. In disposition he was&#xD;
revengeful, tenacious in his memory of a&#xD;
wrong, sly and secret in his windings as&#xD;
a serpent, and, with less nobility than&#xD;
the rattlesnake, he gave no warning&#xD;
before he struck. Yet, as I have said&#xD;
before, he was brave, when occasion,&#xD;
called for courage, and although ever&#xD;
ready to take pa advantage, he never&#xD;
flinched in the presence'of danger. This&#xD;
extreme caution, united with a strong&#xD;
will and courage to do, made him an ex-&#xD;
ceedingly formidable man.&#xD;
A fourth member was Joaquin Valen-&#xD;
zuela, named in a preceding page. His&#xD;
chief threw  upon him much responsi-&#xD;
bility in the government of the band, and&#xD;
entrusted him with important expedi-&#xD;
tions requiring in heir execution a great&#xD;
amount of skill and experience. Valen-&#xD;
zuela was a much older man than his-&#xD;
leader, and had acted for many years in&#xD;
Mexico as a bandit under the famous&#xD;
guerilla chief, Padre Jurata.&#xD;
&#xD;
Another, 4istinguished member was&#xD;
Pedro Gonzales, less brave than =Any&#xD;
others, but a skillful spy and ,expert&#xD;
horse thief, and, as such, ,an'invaluable&#xD;
adjunct to a company of mounted men&#xD;
who required a continual supply of fresh&#xD;
horses, as well as a thorough knowledge&#xD;
of the state of affairs around them,. ,&#xD;
There were many others belonging to&#xD;
this organization, whom it is not nee-&#xD;
essaryto describe. It insufficient to pay&#xD;
they composed as formidable a force of&#xD;
outlaws as ever gladdened the eye of an&#xD;
acknowledged leader. Their, number at&#xD;
this early period is not accurately known,&#xD;
but a fair estimate would not place it at&#xD;
a lower figure-than fifty, with the advan-&#xD;
tage of a continual and steady increase,&#xD;
including a few renegade Americans,- of&#xD;
desperate characters and fortunes.,&#xD;
Besides Joaquin Murieta, there were&#xD;
others of the banditti who were accom-&#xD;
panied by their mistresses. The names&#xD;
of these devoted but fair and fraif ones&#xD;
will be of frequent occurrence in the sue-&#xD;
ceeding pages.&#xD;
Such was the unsettled condition of&#xD;
things, so distant and isolated were the&#xD;
different mining regions, so lonely and&#xD;
uninhabited the sections through which&#xD;
the roads and trails were cut, and so&#xD;
numerous the friends and acquintances&#xD;
of the bandits themselves, that these&#xD;
lawless men carried on their operatioAs&#xD;
with almost absolute impunity. It was&#xD;
a rule with them to injure no man who&#xD;
ever extended thdm a favor, and whilst&#xD;
they plundered every one else, and spread&#xD;
devastation in every other quarter, they&#xD;
invariably left those ranches and houses&#xD;
unharmed, whose. owners and inmates&#xD;
had afforded them shelter or assistance.&#xD;
Many persons who were otherwise hon-&#xD;
estly inclined, bought the safety of their&#xD;
lives and property by remaining scrupu-&#xD;
lously silent in regard to Joaquin, and&#xD;
neutral in every attempt to do him an&#xD;
injury. Further than this, there were&#xD;
many large rancheros who were secretly&#xD;
connected with the banditti, and stood&#xD;
&#xD;
JOA Q UIN M URJBTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
ready to harbor them in times of danger,&#xD;
and-to furnish them with thebest animal&#xD;
that-fed on their extensive pastures. The-&#xD;
names of several of these wealthy, and&#xD;
highly respectable individuals are well&#xD;
known, and will transpire in the course;&#xD;
of this history.&#xD;
&amp;amp;t the: head of this most powerful&#xD;
combination of men, Joaguin ravagect&#xD;
the state in various quarters during the&#xD;
year 1851, without at that time being&#xD;
generally known as the leader; hi* sub-&#xD;
ordinates, Claudio, Valenzuelaand Ped&#xD;
Gonzalez, being alternately mistaken for.&#xD;
the chief. Except to a few persons, even&#xD;
his name was unknown, and many were&#xD;
personally acquaited withhim, and fre-&#xD;
quently saw him in the different towns&#xD;
and villages, without having the re-&#xD;
motest idea that he stood connected with&#xD;
the bloody events which were then fill-&#xD;
ing the country with terror and dismay.&#xD;
He resided for weeks at a timein differ-&#xD;
ent localities, ostensibly  engaged in&#xD;
gambling, or eniployed as a vaquero, a&#xD;
packer, or in some other apparently hon-&#xD;
est avocation, spendmig mu-chof his time&#xD;
in the society of that sweetest of all com-&#xD;
panions, the woman that he loved.&#xD;
,While living in a secluded part of'the&#xD;
town of San Jose, sometime in the sum-&#xD;
mer of '51, he one night became violent-&#xD;
ly engaged in a row at a fandango, was&#xD;
arrested for a breach of the peace, brought&#xD;
up before a magistrate and fined twelve&#xD;
dollar. He was in charge of Mr. Clark,&#xD;
the Deputy Sheriff of Santa blara coun-&#xD;
ty, who had made himself particularly&#xD;
obnoxious to the banditti, by his rigor-&#xD;
ous scrutiny into their conduct, and his&#xD;
determined attempts to arrest some of&#xD;
their number. Joaquin had the com-&#xD;
plete advantage of him, inasmuch as the&#xD;
Deputy was totally ignorant of the true&#xD;
character of the man with whom he had&#xD;
to deal. With the utmost frankness in&#xD;
his manner, Joaquin requested him to&#xD;
walk down to his residence in the skirts&#xD;
of the town, where he would pay hm&#xD;
the money.&#xD;

Informed Clark that he had brought hiti&#xD;
there to kill hm, 'at the same instant&#xD;
stabbing him to theheart-before he could&#xD;
draw his revolver. Though many per-&#xD;
sons knewthe author of this most cool&#xD;
and bloody deed, by sight, yet it was a&#xD;
longtime before it was ascertained that&#xD;
the-escaped znurderer was no less a per-&#xD;
sonage than the leader of the daring cut-&#xD;
throats who , were then infesting the&#xD;
country.&#xD;
In the-fall of the same year, Joaquin&#xD;
removed' up in the more nbrthern'part of&#xD;
the State, and settled himself down with&#xD;
his mistress at the Sonorian Camp, a&#xD;
cluster of tents and'cloth houses, situated&#xD;
about three miles from the city of Marys-&#xD;
ville, in Yuba County. It was not long&#xD;
before the entire country rung with the&#xD;
accounts of frequent, startling and dia.&#xD;
bolical murders.&#xD;
Seven men were murdered within three&#xD;
or four days in a region of country not'&#xD;
more than twelve miles in extent.&#xD;
Shortly after the murders thus men-&#xD;
tioned, two men who were traveling on,&#xD;
theroad that leads upFeather River, near&#xD;
to the Honcut Greek, which puts into that&#xD;
stream, discovered just ahead of them&#xD;
four'Mexeans, one of whom was drag-&#xD;
ging'at his saddle-bow, by a lariat, an&#xD;
American whom they had just lassoed&#xD;
around the neck. The travelers did not&#xD;
think it prudent to interfere, and so hur-&#xD;
ried on to a.place of safety, and re;&amp;amp;rted&#xD;
what they had seen. - Legal search being&#xD;
made upon this information, four other&#xD;
men were found murdered near the same&#xD;
place, bearing upon their throats the&#xD;
fatal mark of the lariat.&#xD;
Close upon these outrages, reports&#xD;
came that several individuals had been&#xD;
killed and robbed at Bidwell's Bar, some&#xD;
ten or fifteen miles up the river. Con-&#xD;
sternation spread like fire,; fear thrilled&#xD;
&#xD;
the hearts ofhundreds, and all dreaded&#xD;
to travel the piablic rads.&#xD;
Suspicion asidirectedtorthe "So1horian&#xD;
Camp,"'it being occupied exclusively by&#xD;
Mexicans, many of whom had no ostei-&#xD;
ible - employment, and yet rode fine&#xD;
hores, and: spent money freely. This&#xD;
suspicion was confirmed by a partial t on-&#xD;
fession obtained from a Mexican thief,&#xD;
who had fallen into the "hands of the&#xD;
O Vigilance Committee" of Matysville,&#xD;
and had been run up with ,. nope&#xD;
several times to the limb of a treedy&#xD;
otder of that forinidable body.'&#xD;
He confessed to the commission of no&#xD;
crime himself, but pointed to the Sonor-&#xD;
ian Camp as theretreat of certain parties&#xD;
who had been carrying on the system of&#xD;
robberies 'and murders' complained of.&#xD;
Obtaining a description of the principal&#xD;
characters at the suspected camp, the&#xD;
Sheriff of Yuba County, R. B.Bchanan,&#xD;
accox -anied bya man familiarly known&#xD;
as "I e Bowen," proceeded on a iion-&#xD;
light night to examine the premises, and&#xD;
to consummate an arrest of one or more,&#xD;
by surprise.  Hitching their horses a&#xD;
half mile distant, they advanced on foot&#xD;
to the dangerous neighborhood. 'Comn-&#xD;
ing suddenly upjon a small tent a few&#xD;
hundred yards from the main camp, not&#xD;
having observed it in the obscurity of&#xD;
the bushes, they were barked at by a&#xD;
ferocious dog, who appeared likely by&#xD;
his fierce' outcries to arouse the whole&#xD;
encampnient."&#xD;
"It won't do," said Buchanan, "to be&#xD;
bothered with such a howling as this,&#xD;
and we musta kill that dog. : 1Astrikes&#xD;
me that I dah manage it. if we appear&#xD;
to be frightened, and beat a retreat, he&#xD;
will come directly up to take'hold of one&#xD;
or the other of us; then we must let him&#xD;
have a little cold' steel."&#xD;
Accordingly the two moved off hastily&#xD;
and, true to the prediction of Buchanan,&#xD;
the animal -rushed forward with frantic&#xD;
ferocity.,- Bowen, being a little behind,&#xD;
he sprang - with one floun.l upon hia&#xD;

&#xD;
back, got him down. in an instant, and&#xD;
,was giving ,him more than under the&#xD;
ircumstances, was at all comfortable,&#xD;
when Buchanan, having the beast at a&#xD;
disadvantage, drew a bowie-knife, and&#xD;
plunging it into his heart laid him&#xD;
-dead on the spot. This done they con-&#xD;
tinued their advances, but by the stir-&#xD;
ring to and fro on the outskirts of the&#xD;
camp, they soon perceived that the dog&#xD;
had given a little too much warning.&#xD;
In a somewhat isolated corner near a&#xD;
piece of fencing they discovered stand-&#xD;
ing-by a fire near an open teit, a Mexi-&#xD;
can *rapped in his aerappe who was&#xD;
peering out anxiously into the shadows,&#xD;
and who appeared to answer to a des-&#xD;
,cription of one of the Sonorian des-&#xD;
-perados, as given by the thief hereto-&#xD;
fore mentioned. as having been in the&#xD;
hands of the Vigilance Committee.&#xD;
"Let us get down on our hands and&#xD;
knees," said Buchanan, "or we may be&#xD;
discovered."&#xD;
Crawling in this manner they reached&#xD;
the fence, and looking through they dis-&#xD;
'covered that the Mexican was missing.&#xD;
The fellow has seen us," observed&#xD;
.Buchanan, "and we must look sharp or&#xD;
lie and his crowd will have the advan-'&#xD;
tage."&#xD;
He and Bowen. then commenced craw-&#xD;
Ing through the bars 9f the fence, and&#xD;
while in the act were startled by three-'&#xD;
distinct shots, which were soon again re-&#xD;
peated. Extricating themselves as soon&#xD;
.as possible from the fence, they rose to&#xD;
-their feet, and discovered three Mexicans&#xD;
,blazing away at them with revolvers&#xD;
from a point near a bush, behind which&#xD;
-they had been hidden. Of course the&#xD;
Sheriff and his assistant were not long in&#xD;
returning the fire, and a very brisk on-&#xD;
gagement ensued. The Mexicans, ap-&#xD;
parently unhurt, retired, and Buchanan&#xD;
and Bowen were left to their own com-&#xD;
pany. The former then found that lie&#xD;
had been severely wounded, and after&#xD;
walking a few hundred yards from the&#xD;
scene of conflict fell to the earth, and&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
was unable to rise. The ball had struck&#xD;
him near the spine, and passing through&#xD;
his body, had come out in front near the&#xD;
navel. He had evidently received it&#xD;
while in 4 stooping posture at the fence.&#xD;
Leaving him as he lay, Bowen hastened&#xD;
to his horse and hurried to town for as-&#xD;
sistance, which shortly arrived, and Bu-&#xD;
chanan was taken back. to Marysville&#xD;
and properly cared for. He lay a long&#xD;
timein a very dangerous situation, bit&#xD;
eventually recovered, much to the grati-&#xD;
fication of the comnunity,'who admired&#xD;
the devotion and courage with which he&#xD;
had well-nigh sacrificed his life to the&#xD;
discharge of duty. MHe was somewhat as-&#xD;
tonished to learn, a considerable period&#xD;
afterward, that he had received his wound&#xD;
in an actual personal encounter with the&#xD;
redoubtable Joaquin Murieta himself.&#xD;
He it was who had been standing before&#xD;
the fire in front of the tent, and had&#xD;
with his quick eye discovered the two&#xD;
hostile formd as they approached him&#xD;
through the patches of moonlight.&#xD;

peak, and serves at 'a distance of two&#xD;
hundred miles to direct the course of the&#xD;
mountain traveler. Gazing at it from&#xD;
the Sacramento Valley, it rises in its gar-&#xD;
ments of snow, like some mighty arch-&#xD;
angel, filling theheaven with his Polemn&#xD;
presence.&#xD;
In the rugged fastnesses of the wild&#xD;
range lying to-the west of this huge&#xD;
mount, arange inhabited onlyby human&#xD;
savages and savage beasts, did the out-&#xD;
laws hide, themselves for several long&#xD;
months, descending into the valleys at&#xD;
intervals, with no further purpose than&#xD;
to steal horses, of' which they seemed&#xD;
determined to keep a good supply. They&#xD;
induced the Indians to aid them in this&#xD;
laudable purpose, and so effileiently did&#xD;
these simple people render their assist-&#xD;
ance, that the rancheros of that region&#xD;
loaded the very air with their curses of&#xD;
the " naked devils," who tormented them&#xD;
to such an intolerable degree. On one&#xD;
occasion, during these depredations upon&#xD;
locomotive property, an  exasperated&#xD;
party of Americans, who had been on&#xD;
* the track of their stolen animals, came&#xD;
up with the Indian thieves, and man-&#xD;
aged to hem them in between a perpen-&#xD;
dicular wall of bluffs and a deep river,&#xD;
so that there was no escape for them but&#xD;
to swim the stream, which swept by in&#xD;
a mad and foaming torrent. -They fired&#xD;
upon the Indians, who .leaped into the&#xD;
water, many of them dyeing it with&#xD;
their blood, and a few successfully swim-&#xD;
ming across. In the midst of the firing&#xD;
a tall Mexican, mounted upon a fine&#xD;
horse, dashed down the banks, firing his&#xD;
revolver as he went, and plunged into&#xD;
the stream, His horse struck out boldly&#xD;
with him for the opposite shore, and he&#xD;
had gained the middle of the current,&#xD;
a distance of a hundred yards from his&#xD;
pursuers, before any effectual shot at him&#xD;
was made. He was about to escape, and&#xD;
nothing would now avail but a dead aim&#xD;
and a-steady nerve. The best iarks-&#xD;
man in the crowd, a lank Missourian.&#xD;
&#xD;
dismounted from his horse,'drew hisrifle&#xD;
ft his shoulder whild the others looked&#xD;
anxiously on, and taking a long " bad,r&#xD;
fired.,. The. Mexican leaned Ib-rward a&#xD;
moment and the next" Instant floated.&#xD;
from'the saddle-and sunk, while his fine-&#xD;
charger breasted tie waves and ascended&#xD;
the bank with a snorting -nostr'il and&#xD;
dripping mane., lNo one was willing to&#xD;
risk the dangerous passage evento pos-&#xD;
sess so noble an animdl, and they re-&#xD;
turned with their recovered property to-&#xD;
their homes. This tall, Mexican was a.&#xD;
member of Joaquin's band, who had led&#xD;
the Indians in 'that very unuiecessful'&#xD;
thieviiig expedition.&#xD;
. In that desolateregion, through which,.&#xD;
at long intervals, only few straggling-&#xD;
miners passed, on. their lonesome pros-&#xD;
pecting tours, human skeletons'-ere&#xD;

no trace of the manner in, which they-&#xD;
perished, while others plainly showed.&#xD;
byAhe perforated skull that thewleaden-&#xD;
ball had suddenly and secretly done its.&#xD;
work. The ignorant Indians suffered for&#xD;
many a deed which had beein perpe-&#xD;
trated by civilized hands. It will be re-&#xD;
collected by many persons who 'resided'&#xD;
at Yreka a-id on Scott's River, in the fall&#xD;
and winter cf 1851, how many prospec-&#xD;
tors were lost in the mountains and never-&#xD;
again heard from; how many were found.&#xD;
dead, supposed to have been killed'by-&#xD;
the Indians, and yet bearing upon their,&#xD;
bodies the marks of knives and bullets.&#xD;
quite as frequently as arrows.&#xD;
In one of the descents of the banditti&#xD;
into the valleys,, they ventured -into the;&#xD;
plains which skirted Feather River, and.&#xD;
on the edge of which is situated the-&#xD;
town of Hamilton. This was along dis--&#xD;
tanco from the coast range, but the fall.&#xD;
months of 1851 were clear and ild, and.&#xD;
camping out was a mere pastime. Here.&#xD;
the bandits were frequently scattered,.&#xD;
two or three riding together, others' re-&#xD;
maining at the temporary camp, others.&#xD;
again running off horses from Neil's-&#xD;

her favorite pastime 9f'elkchasing. It&#xD;
may well be conjeid that 'the ban-&#xD;
dits were somewstastonished at this&#xD;
unu   sight, forhey had never seen&#xD;
or heard of this extraordinary maiden&#xD;
befr.' Neither the elk nior the girl&#xD;
paid any attention to them, but dashed&#xD;
6"pQursued and pursuing. The robbers,&#xD;
exhilarated by the spectacle, put spurs to&#xD;
their horses and folowed in the chase:&#xD;
Onward sped the wild hunters for a mile&#xD;
or more, till now she gains upon the&#xD;
panting beast, reaches within twenty or&#xD;
thirty feet of him, whirls the. adjusted&#xD;
loop around and around her head to give&#xD;
it impetus, and lets loose the springing&#xD;
coil. Forth it flies on its lengthened&#xD;
mission, and the noose drops down over-&#xD;
the branching horns. The well-trained&#xD;
mustang stops short in his tracks, the&#xD;
cord tightens at the saddle-bow, and the&#xD;
flying elk, suddenly jerked backward,&#xD;
falls heavily to the ground. With a&#xD;
shout of applause the robbers recognize&#xD;
the capture and rein their chargers to&#xD;
the spot. Addressing the girl in Span-&#xD;
ish, they found she spoke English, and&#xD;
so conversed with her moderately well&#xD;
in that language. The elk being some-&#xD;
what refractory, they politely offered to&#xD;
help her home with it, and did so, driv-&#xD;
ing it forward while she galloped on&#xD;
ahead. Arriving at her father's camp,&#xD;
it was courtesy to ask the strangers to&#xD;
alight and refresh themselves. They&#xD;
partook of the wholesome repast spread&#xD;
before them by the younger sister, and&#xD;
had finished their last cupofcoffee, when&#xD;
old Peter entered. He looked at his new-&#xD;
found guests with a degree of suspicion,&#xD;
and saluted them but coldly. He took&#xD;
no apparent interest in the rehearsal of&#xD;
his daughter's adventure, and, when the&#xD;
strangers arose to depart he did not ask&#xD;
them to call again. One of them, how-&#xD;
ever, the smooth spoken and graceful&#xD;
Claudio, did call the next day, and old&#xD;
Peter peremptorily ordered him away.&#xD;
There was something in the old man's&#xD;
look that even as brave a scoundrel as&#xD;
&#xD;
Claudil did notlike necessarily to&#xD;
ley with, and thinking  discretion the&#xD;
better part of "loIr,' ho left  la Peter,,&#xD;
it sees, knew instntiely that he war&#xD;
a rascal, and was, not disposed to waste&#xD;
any ceremonious c6urtey upon hn.&#xD;
After the expiration of a few '4ays, the&#xD;
young Diana concluded to ride over in-&#xD;
to the woods that skirt Butter rei;e' a&#xD;
clear, pebbly-bottomed stream that em-&#xD;
pties into the Feather Riter, some dis-&#xD;
tance above Hamilton.  She took her&#xD;
rifle with her--a- small-bored,. silver-&#xD;
mounted piece, with an elegant curly&#xD;
maple stock-thinking that she would'&#xD;
bring in a number of the gray squirrels'&#xD;
with which the grounds abounded; for&#xD;
the purpose of converting them into a&#xD;
pot-pie. The sharp crack of her rifle was&#xD;
the death-knell of many an "adjidaumo,"&#xD;
and soon, with a string of the bushy-&#xD;
tailed "varmints,". at her saddle-bow,.&#xD;
she grew weary of the sport, and reclined'&#xD;
for* brief rest upon a plot -of dry grass&#xD;
underneath an oak tree, leavingherdoelle-&#xD;
pony to feed at his discretion in the&#xD;
neighborhood. It was not long before-&#xD;
she fell asleep. How long she had slum-&#xD;
bered she could not say, but she was sud-&#xD;
denly awakened by a strong pressure up-&#xD;
on her wrists, and opening her eyes ina&#xD;
fuller consciousness, she found herself in&#xD;
the grasp of apowerful man. It was the&#xD;
late companion of Claudio, in the matter&#xD;
of the elk adventure and the subsequent&#xD;
repast at old Peter's camp. The villain&#xD;
had secured the girl's wrists with a&#xD;
piece of cord, and now held a knife at&#xD;
her throat, threatening to kill her in-&#xD;
stantly if she dared to scream out. Never-&#xD;
theless she did scream, until a gag was&#xD;
thrust into her mouth by a second party&#xD;
whom she had not until then discovered,&#xD;
and who proved to be Claudio. The two&#xD;
were proceeding to drag the terrified girl&#xD;
into an adjacent thicket, rendered well&#xD;
nigh impervious by a mazy entangle-&#xD;
ment of wild peavines, when a horsernam&#xD;
dashed up, and cocking his revolver,&#xD;
commanded the rascals to desist.. The&amp;amp;&#xD;
&#xD;
girl was surprised to @ee that.tihey In-&#xD;
stantly obeye.g She was unbound, her&#xD;
flertored to head dhePOnyled'to&#xD;
whee she was standing. After she was&#xD;
mounted, and on the point of departing,&#xD;
her strangerescuer rode dosely up to&#xD;
her and said:&#xD;
oi lYoung woman, you've heard of Jo-&#xD;
quin Mreta. I'm the man. When&#xD;
Youear peoe abusing me; hereafter,&#xD;
perhaps yo'll think I'm not quite so&#xD;
big a scoundrel as they say I am, after&#xD;
all. ,Now, hurry, home, before some&#xD;
other danger overtakes you.",&#xD;
With a grateful heart, the maiden&#xD;
bade him adieu, and galloped off. When&#xD;
at a distance of about a hundred yards,&#xD;
the group still gazing at her, she sud-&#xD;
denly halted, and turned around as if to&#xD;
come back, but stood still, facing them.&#xD;
While they were wondering what on&#xD;
earth she could be at,they soon perceived&#xD;
that she was deliberately leveling her&#xD;
rifle to draw a "bead " on some one of&#xD;
the party. Claudio instinctively w~eled&#xD;
from the front of the tree, where he was&#xD;
standing, with a sudden effort to slide&#xD;
behind it, when the rifle cracked, and the&#xD;
bark flew from the exact spot at which&#xD;
he would have been struck to the heart&#xD;
if he had remained a moment longer.&#xD;
With a sharp feminine whoop and a gay&#xD;
laugh of defiance, the spirited damsel&#xD;
put wings to her- horse's feet and was&#xD;
soon out of sight.&#xD;
Old Peter, I have already said, was an&#xD;
honest man, but, much as he hated vil&#xD;
lains he was never heard, so long as&#xD;
he remained i the country, to speak a&#xD;
harsh word of the robber Joaquin.&#xD;
If any are curious to know of the sub&#xD;
sequent history of the old hunter an&#xD;
his two daughters, they will find it,I&#xD;
think, in the first series of the published&#xD;

As soon as the spring opened in 1852,&#xD;
Joaquin and his party descended from&#xD;
the mountains, and by forced marches&#xD;
in the night, drove some two or three&#xD;
hundred horses which they had collected&#xD;
at their winter rendezvous, downthrough&#xD;
the southern portion of the State, into&#xD;
the province of Sonora. Returming in a&#xD;
few weeks,,-they took up their headquar-&#xD;
ters at the Arroyo Cautoova, a fine tract&#xD;
of rich pasturage containing seven or&#xD;
eight thousand acres, beautifully wa-&#xD;
tered, and fenced in by a circular wall&#xD;
of mountains, through which an entrance&#xD;
was afforded by a narrow gate or pass,&#xD;
at which a very formidable force could&#xD;
be stayed in their progress- by a small&#xD;
- body of men. This rich and fertile basin&#xD;
lies half-way between the Tejon and the&#xD;
Pacheco Pass, to the east of the Coast&#xD;
Range, and to the west of the great Tu-&#xD;

gazed into those dark and glorious e&#xD;
which had neverquailed. before morta&#xD;

they looked on -her.  Besides, in her&#xD;
tender heart she made for him many al.&#xD;
lowances; she saw-many strong pallia-&#xD;
tions of his conduct in the treatment&#xD;
which he had received; she knew the&#xD;
secret history of his soul, his sufferings,&#xD;
and his struggles with an evil fate, and&#xD;
the long agony which rent up by the&#xD;
roots the original honesty of his high-&#xD;
born nature. More than this, he had&#xD;
told her that he would. soon finish his&#xD;
dangerous career, when, having com-&#xD;
pleted his revenge, and having accumu-&#xD;
lated an equivalent for the fortune of&#xD;
which he had beenrobbed by the Ameri-&#xD;

- cans residing in the town. This was&#xD;
- in the month of April. While here, the&#xD;
women appeared in their ,popettire,&#xD;
and were admired for their exceedingly&#xD;
modest and quiet deportment. The men&#xD;
issued forth at night upon no praise-&#xD;
worthy ,missions, and, mounted upon&#xD;
their magnificent chargers, .scoured an&#xD;
extent of many miles ere they returned&#xD;
stealthily back to their hiding place,&#xD;
and the arms of their languishing loves.&#xD;
Joaquin bore the appearance and charac-&#xD;
ter of an elegant andsuccessful gambler&#xD;
being amply provided .with means from&#xD;
his night excursions.&#xD;
In the meantime his men were, in&#xD;
different directions, prosecuting with&#xD;
ardor the business uppn which they had&#xD;
been sent,; and there wa a universal cry&#xD;
throughout. the lower country, that&#xD;
horse thieves were very nearly inlpover-&#xD;
ishing the ranchos. Joqquin gathered a&#xD;
pretty good knowledge of what his fol-&#xD;
lowers were about from the newspapers,&#xD;
which made a very free use of his own&#xD;
name, in the accounts of these transac-&#xD;
tions, and handled his character in no&#xD;

Alfter remaningas long as he desired&#xD;
at Mokelimne Hill, about the  rs&#xD;
May he prepared to take his departure,&#xD;
which he resolved to do at. the hour of&#xD;
midnight. Ils horses were saddled, the&#xD;
wonien dressed in their male clothes,&#xD;
and everything ready, when Joaquin&#xD;
sauntered out into 'he streets, according&#xD;
to iis custom, and visited the various&#xD;
'dinkiig and gambling salons, with&#xD;
which every California town and village&#xD;
abound. Whilesitting at a monte table,&#xD;
at which he carelessly put down a dollar&#xD;
or two to while away the time, his atten-&#xD;
tion was suddenly arrested by the dis-&#xD;
tinct pronunciationof his name just op.&#xD;
posite to where he sat. Looking up, he&#xD;
observed; tree or four Americans en-&#xD;
gaged in loud and earnest conversation# in&#xD;
relation to himself, in which'one of them&#xD;
a tall fellow, armed with a revolver, re&#xD;
marked, that he "would justlikeonce in&#xD;
his 1ie'to comtie across Joaquin, and that&#xD;
he wonl kill him as quick as he would&#xD;
a snake." The daring bandit, upon hear&#xD;
iug thisspeech, jumped upon the mont&#xD;
table in vier of the whole house, an&#xD;
drawing his six.shooter, shouted out&#xD;
"Iami Joaquin ! If there is any shooting&#xD;
to d leain in 11" So sudden and startling&#xD;
was iiis movement that every on&#xD;
qu-iledbefore him, and'in the midst'o&#xD;
the consternation ,nd confusion which&#xD;
reigned le gathered his cldk aboutii&#xD;

Returning tolsredzv1atAoo&#xD;

bands had gathered some two or three&#xD;

waiting his further orders. He de-&#xD;
a potion"of them to take the&#xD;
animals into Sonora for safekeeping, and&#xD;
made remittances of money at the same&#xD;
time to a secret partner of his in that&#xD;
State.&#xD;
Towards the last of May, becoming&#xD;
again restless, and tired of an inactive&#xD;
life, he started forth upon thehighroads,&#xD;
attended as before, when on his visit to&#xD;
Mokelumne Hill, simply by Reyes Felhz,&#xD;
Pedro Gonzalez, Juan and the three&#xD;
bright-eyed girls, who, mounted on very&#xD;
elegant chargers, appeared as charming&#xD;
a trio of handsome cavaliers as ever de-&#xD;
lighted the visions of romantic damsels.&#xD;
Meeting with no one for a week or two&#xD;
but impoverished Frenchmen, and dilapi-&#xD;
. dated Germans, in search of "diggins,"&#xD;
and having sent very nearly all his&#xD;
moiey to Sonora, Joaquin's purse was&#xD;
I  getting rather low, and he resolved to&#xD;
attack the first man or men he might&#xD;
e  meet, who appeared to be supplied. He&#xD;
d was this time on the road to San Luis&#xD;
Gonzagos, to which place a young Amer-&#xD;
g ican, iamed Albert Ruddle, was at the&#xD;
g  time driving a wagon loaded with gro-&#xD;
.e ceries, -Overtaking this young man on&#xD;

he mig    ave about  m   marking at&#xD;
" It is true I amn a robber, but, as sure&#xD;
as I lve, I merely wish to borrow' this&#xD;
money, and I will as certainly pay it&#xD;
back to you as my name is Joaquin. It&#xD;
is not often that I am without funds, but'&#xD;
such is my situation at present."&#xD;
Ruddle, without replying, made a sud-,&#xD;
denemotiontodrawhispistol,upon which&#xD;
Joaquin exclaimed:,-&#xD;
"Come, .don't be foolish-I have no&#xD;
wish. to kill you, and let us have no&#xD;
fight."4.              '&#xD;
Ruddle made another effort to get his&#xD;
pistol, which,from excitement, orperhaps&#xD;
from its hanging in the holster, he could&#xD;
not instantly draw, when the bandit,&#xD;
witha muttered oath, slashed him across&#xD;
the neck with his bowie knife and dash-&#xD;
ed him from the saddle. Searching his&#xD;
pockets, he found about three hundred&#xD;
dollars. His party coming up, he rode&#xD;
on, leaving the murdered man where he&#xD;
lay, and his wagon*'and team standing&#xD;
by the road. Joaquin's conscience smote&#xD;
him for this deed, and he regretted the&#xD;
necessity of killing so honest and hard&#xD;
working a man as Ruddle seemed to be.*&#xD;
It happened that just. at this period,&#xD;
"apt. Harry Love, whose own history is&#xD;
one of equal romance with that of Joa&#xD;
quin, but marked onlywith events which&#xD;
redound to his honor, was at the head of&#xD;
a small party, gotten up on his own re-&#xD;
sponsibility, in search of this outrageous&#xD;
bandit. Love had served as an express&#xD;
rider in the Mexican war, and had borne&#xD;
despatches from one military post to an-&#xD;
other, over the most dangerous tracts of&#xD;
Mexico. He had traveled alone for hun-&#xD;
dreds of miles over mountains and des-&#xD;
erts, while beset with a no less danger&#xD;
than the dreaded."guerillas," who hung&#xD;
upon the skirts of the American army,&#xD;
laid 'in wait at mountain passes..and&#xD;
watering places, and made it their busi-&#xD;

and many a hard race with themhas the,&#xD;
Captain had to save his neek and the&#xD;
valuable papers in his charge. He had&#xD;
been, moreover, fr9m his early youth, a&#xD;
hardy pioneer, experienced in all the&#xD;
dangers and hardships of a border life.&#xD;
Having these antecedents in his favor,&#xD;
and possessing the utmost coolness in&#xD;
danger, he was a man well fitted to con-&#xD;
tend with a person like Joaquin, than&#xD;
whom the lightning was not quickerand&#xD;
surer in the execution ofa deadly errand.&#xD;
Love was on the direct trail of Joaquin,&#xD;
when Ruddle was murdered. With the&#xD;
utmost speed consistent with the caution&#xD;
necessary to a surprise of the bandit, he&#xD;
pursued him by his murders and robber-&#xD;
ies, which left a bloody trail behind him,&#xD;
to the rancho of San' Luis (fonsagos,&#xD;
which is now well known to have been&#xD;
a place which regularly harbored the&#xD;
banditti. Arriving at that place at&#xD;
night, he ascertained by certain spies&#xD;
whom he had employed, that the party&#xD;
of whom he was in search, were staying&#xD;
in a canvas house on the edge of the&#xD;
rancho.&#xD;
Proceeding cautiously t9 this house&#xD;
with his men, the Captain had just&#xD;
reached the door, when the alarm was&#xD;
given by a woman in a neighboring tent,&#xD;
and in an instant Joaquin, Gonzalez,&#xD;
Reyes Feliz and Juan had cut their way,&#xD;
through the back part of the canvas and&#xD;
escaped into the darkness. On entering,&#xD;
no one was-to be seen but women, three&#xD;
of whom, then dressed in their proper&#xD;
garments, were the bandits' mistresses,&#xD;
of which fact, however, Love was igno-&#xD;
rant. Leaving. the women to shift for&#xD;
themselves, the fugitives went to their&#xD;
horses, which were, hitched in an adja-&#xD;
cent thicket, mounted them, and rode&#xD;
directly over to Oris Timbers, a distance&#xD;
of eight miles, where they immediately&#xD;

soon returned with clothing fr4e party&#xD;

for females, at which, however, they did&#xD;
not grumble, preferring these garments,&#xD;
perhaps, to any other-at any rate, .well&#xD;
satisfied to adopt any sort of dress which&#xD;
would relieve them of the very primitive&#xD;
.style in which they- then appeared.&#xD;
.Mountain Jim also brought a couple of&#xD;
horses, one of which, a fin black animal,&#xD;
saddled and bridled in a most superb&#xD;
manner, he designed for his chief. He&#xD;
handed him at the same time with pre-&#xD;
senting the horso, a Colt's six-shooter and&#xD;
,a silver mounted bowie knife. Thus, in a&#xD;
few moments, was the naked and defence-&#xD;
.less fugitive booted, spurred and fully&#xD;
-equipped-in an instant transformed into&#xD;
a powerful and dreaded outlaw ; and this&#xD;
-by the efficiency of that combination'&#xD;
-which his own daring genius had set on&#xD;
foot and successfully maintained. Hav-&#xD;
ing some mysterious power over persons&#xD;
then connected with the two wealthy&#xD;
ranchos, Camula and San Buenaventura&#xD;

-with the women to visit those ranchos&#xD;
and obtain an outfit suitable for their&#xD;
business,'with instructions for them 2to&#xD;
remain there until he should call or send&#xD;
for them. He and Mountain Jim rode&#xD;
back into the woodsto the place at which&#xD;
he had left Reyes Feliz and his weeping&#xD;
companion. Contrary to allexpectation&#xD;

some shirts and pantaloons, which he&#xD;
presented to, the unfortunates-a most&#xD;

look decent, of which they immediately&#xD;
availed themselves. With- difficulty&#xD;
Reyes Feliz was mounted behin4 his&#xD;
brother-in-law,- and Carmelita took her&#xD;
seat behind Mountain Jim and off they&#xD;
rode in a gallop in the direction of the&#xD;
Mission of San Gabriel. Arriving in San&#xD;
Gabriel after nightfall, they went imme.&#xD;
diately to their nsual meeting place in&#xD;
an oiit-of-the-way house, and there very&#xD;
unexpectedly found Claudio and his&#xD;
band, who had returned from the State&#xD;
of Sonora sooner than expected, and not&#xD;
finding his leader at Arroyo Cantoova,&#xD;
preferred going out on a marauding ex-&#xD;
pedition to remaining idle. He had,&#xD;
placed the horses with which'ie had&#xD;
been sent to.Sonora, upon, a rancho well&#xD;
known to Joaquin, and where they&#xD;
would be perfectly safe. till called for.&#xD;
In the vicinity of San Gabriel he had&#xD;
committed many robberies since his&#xD;
return, and had a purse amply filled-with&#xD;
the needfuZ, which he immediately ten.&#xD;
dered to his leader. But he had been,&#xD;
greatly harassed by Gen. Bean, of, thAt&#xD;
neighborhood,,who had used every exer-&#xD;
tion to apprehend him, and had com-&#xD;
pelled him severallimes, with his whole&#xD;
party,toseeksafety in flight. The greater&#xD;
part of this news was highly gratifying&#xD;
to Joaquin, and he shook his faithful.&#xD;
subordinate most cordially by the hand.&#xD;
"But," said he, " we must never leave&#xD;

carefully hiding from the lynx-eyes of a&#xD;
man whom theydreaded-namely, Capt.&#xD;
Harry Love, then Deputy Sheriff of Los&#xD;
Angeles County, who knew Gonzalez&#xD;
personally, and had caught a glimpse of&#xD;
that noted tlief and his worthy colleague&#xD;
Juan, on the skirts of the Buenaventura&#xD;
Rancho, which was known by a very few&#xD;
to be a harboring place for Joaquin, and&#xD;
closely watched on that account. ~ In a&#xD;
day or two news reached Joaquin that&#xD;
Gonzales had been arrested by Love&#xD;
while on a careless spree at alittle "one&#xD;
horse " grocery on a by-road that led up&#xD;
lnto the'mountains, and that Juan had&#xD;
made his escape after a very close clip&#xD;

learned, in addition, that Love was hur&#xD;
Tying off atothat moment with his un&#xD;
fortunate confederate, in the direction o&#xD;
the county seat of Los Angeles, wher&#xD;
he would certainly be hung. Deter&#xD;

.commanded Claudio to get his band i&#xD;

Jim, he started at full speed to overtak&#xD;
Love, and to save the life of his valuabl&#xD;
subordinate. Having ridden all night&#xD;
*and with the utmost urgency-as their&#xD;
bloody spurs' and the foam of thel&#xD;
,orses attested-they came in sight o&#xD;

him he discovered a pursuing party, en-&#xD;
veloped in a cloud'of dust coming like'a&#xD;
whirlwind, and putting spurs to his&#xD;
horse, rode off at the top of his speed.&#xD;
The bandits dashed up in a few moments&#xD;
to the place where Gonzalez lay, and&#xD;
found him a ghastly corpse. They shed&#xD;
no tears, but gnashed their teeth, with&#xD;
rage and disappointment. It was no use&#xD;
to follow Love, for his horse was fresher&#xD;
than theirs, and he had already left them&#xD;
far in the distancQ,  Leaving the now&#xD;
worthless carcass of their comrade, they&#xD;
rode over to the nearest rancho, and very&#xD;
coolly informing the owners that there&#xD;
was a dead man lying on the side of the&#xD;
road, proceeded on their return to San&#xD;
- Gabriel. Arrived at that place, ,Joa-&#xD;
quin Immediately learned two important&#xD;
facts-one of which was that Three&#xD;
. Fingered Jack, with his party, was at&#xD;
a  Los Angeles, and the other that Capt. -&#xD;
e  Wisoja, Deputy Sheriftof Santa Barbara&#xD;
County, had been at San Gabriel making&#xD;
- inquiries as to his whereabouts, and most&#xD;
f. diligently intent on capturing him,. If&#xD;
e  possible.  Wishing to avoid Captain&#xD;
Wilson, and anxious to see Three FiAg-&#xD;
e  ered Jack, he selected three of his best&#xD;
a  men out of Claudio's band, and started&#xD;
n  down to Los Angeles. He there met&#xD;

head was covered witla a ps fusion of&#xD;
red  air ode up very leisurely to the&#xD;
front of a trading -post, at which Lake&#xD;
and some other gntlemeu were stand-&#xD;
ing, politely raised blishat, and addressed&#xD;
an inquiry to Lake, which caused him to&#xD;
step forward from the crowd the better&#xD;
to converse.&#xD;
"Is your name Lake?" said the red.&#xD;
haired stranger.&#xD;
"The same," was the reply.&#xD;
"Well sir, I am Joaquin I you have&#xD;
lied to me."&#xD;
Lake being unarmed, exclaimed, "Gen-&#xD;
tlemen, protect me," and sprang back&#xD;
towards the crowd.   Several persons&#xD;
drew their revolvers, but not before the&#xD;
quick hand of Joaquin had presented his&#xD;
and pulled the trigger. The aim was&#xD;
fatal, and Lake fell in the agonies of&#xD;
death. The niar'derer wheeled his horse&#xD;
in an instant, and by a sudden bound,&#xD;
passed the aim of the revolvers which&#xD;
were discharged at him. In another in-&#xD;
stant he was seen .on the summit of a&#xD;
hill, surrounded by no less than fifty&#xD;
well-mounted men,-with whom he slowly&#xD;
rode off. Such was the magical luck&#xD;
which pursued this man, following&#xD;
him like an invisible guardian friend, in&#xD;
every hour of his peril, and enabling&#xD;
him to successfully perform deeds which&#xD;
would turn any other man's blood cold.&#xD;
So perfect was the organization which&#xD;
he had established that that apparently&#xD;
harmless Mexican who was standing&#xD;
near while Lake betrayed Joaquin, and&#xD;
who livedgnsuspected in that very town,&#xD;
was none other than a paid member of&#xD;

an eidently n *and'unbxplored region,&#xD;
aitenetieg in saiN#j4 plin  overed with&#xD;
~  g bushes and rocky,intereninghils,&#xD;
dotted with stinted cedai, and eilitened&#xD;
with small valleys, which4vere *atered&#xD;
by bright and sparkling, streams. Fol-&#xD;
lowing one of these they 'discovered that&#xD;
It emptied-as they could trace it for a&#xD;
long distance by its willowy margin, and&#xD;
gradual descent- into a vastlake. As&#xD;
they approached this sheet of water they&#xD;
felt an increasing warmth in the atmos-&#xD;
phere, and pretty soon a hot wind from&#xD;
the direction of the lake. Suddenly, as&#xD;
if to belie the heat, there came down&#xD;
upon them what appeared a terrific snow&#xD;
storm, but they soon discovered that&#xD;
there was no moisture in the flakes, and&#xD;
that they did not melt either upon them-&#xD;
selves or their horses, but left both with&#xD;
Aa ghastly whitehess which it was diffi-&#xD;
cit to shake off. When they told of this&#xD;
event afterward they did not even then&#xD;
know what to make of it, but the writer&#xD;
has since learned that a similar phenom-&#xD;
enon has occurred at Washoe and other&#xD;
points on'the rim of the Utah Basin, and&#xD;
is simply a shower of alkali dust caught&#xD;
up by the whirlwinds In the adjacent&#xD;
deserts, and descending; when their&#xD;
force is spent. Astonished beyond meas-&#xD;
ure at this circumstance, so much so that&#xD;
even Three-Fingered Jack crossed, him-&#xD;
self, and prayed to the Virgin Mary,&#xD;
while the hitherto gay feminines offered&#xD;
at the shrine of the same -Virgin vows&#xD;
of eternal chastity. They rode on,'and&#xD;
the sham snow storm being past they&#xD;
reined up o1 the margin of the expanse&#xD;
of water to which they had been for so.&#xD;
many miles 'tending. 'Here, although&#xD;
prepared for almost anything that might&#xD;
happen, by what they had recently&#xD;
passed through, they were struck with&#xD;
new wonders. And well they might be,&#xD;
for they were on the shoe of an inland&#xD;
sea, as mysterious as might have been.&#xD;
-the dira lake of Awubet,&#xD;
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Wier.'&#xD;
&#xD;
They stood by what 1s nowrknowns*a&#xD;
lAke Mono, the name which was giA&#xD;
it by the Indians who iAshabit that&#xD;
region.&#xD;
This lake, now included in the newlyr&#xD;
organized county of Mono, marked at&#xD;
that time the probable junction of the'&#xD;
somewhat vaguely ~-defined- boundary&#xD;
lines of Calaveras, Mariposa and Fresno&#xD;
counties. It is twenty-seven miles long'&#xD;
and sixteen broad, curving somewhat la&#xD;
the shape of a crescent , with a large'&#xD;
island in the middle,'five miles in length&#xD;
and whitened on the edges with peculiar&#xD;
incrustations. A white vapor, like in-&#xD;
cense from an altar, continually rises&#xD;
from this island, caused by the- presence&#xD;
of the hot 'springs which it contains;&#xD;
and the subterranean heat is such that&#xD;
although a night's lodging on the island&#xD;
is tolerable, it is not altogether comfor-&#xD;
table. Nevertheless there are also springs&#xD;
of fresh water in the island, and some&#xD;
salt. Near by is a smaller island, lying-&#xD;
dim  and dingy by the side of the-&#xD;
other.&#xD;
Although the waters of the lake are-&#xD;
clear, they have a Lethe-like and drowsy&#xD;
appearance, and within their slumbering-&#xD;
depths no living thing is found, with the,&#xD;
single exception of an insect, which is'pe&#xD;
culiar to the lake, and which has been dis-&#xD;
covered nowhere else in the world. This,&#xD;
nondescript is shaped somewhat like a&#xD;
snail, has something like rudimental&#xD;
wings, is about three-quarters ofan inch&#xD;
long, and of a brownish color. They&#xD;
skim in swarms over, the surface, or&#xD;
crawl upon the bottom, and in mild&#xD;
weather myriads are heaped upon the&#xD;
shore, and stretched out at times in liv-&#xD;
ing masses, as many as three feet deep.&#xD;
They constitute food for the miserabl'e-&#xD;
Root Diggers who haunt those parts,&#xD;
and also glut the innumerable gulls.&#xD;
that roost on the island and occasional&#xD;
rocks which break the mirr9r of the'&#xD;
water. The birds natied form the only&#xD;
life above the surface, unless we except&#xD;
a few desolate and lonesome looking&#xD;

ried for a day or twoac ording as the&#xD;
fancy seized them. Still in search of in-&#xD;
cident and novelty, they kept their course&#xD;
southward-the character of the country&#xD;
varying between that of undulating&#xD;
plains, covered with sage brush, and rug-&#xD;
ged hills and mountain spurs, together&#xD;
with abyssmal vales, through which pre-&#xD;
cipitous streams thundered--until -they&#xD;
arrived at the eastern verge ofTulare&#xD;
county. HFere -they again, came into a&#xD;
region of striking desolation, and were&#xD;
destined to meet with new and un-&#xD;
dreamed of marvels. It was a rough&#xD;
tract of brOken mountains, seeming to&#xD;
be separate and apart from the Sierra&#xD;
Nevada Range, whose sublime ,peaks&#xD;
rose on the right, erowned with snow,&#xD;
and its entire face was blackened and&#xD;
crisped from the effects of volcanic action.&#xD;
It was a region treeless and waterless&#xD;
withnthe exception of boiling springs,&#xD;
&#xD;
-which bubbled up in the most unexpect-&#xD;
,ed places. Birds there were none, save&#xD;
a species of lonely snake killers, which&#xD;
half run and half fly over desert spots,&#xD;
,and make war upon every reptile and&#xD;
serpentt they meet. Having traveled with&#xD;
great difficulty, owing to the treacher-&#xD;
ous character of the encrusted ground,&#xD;
for about twenty miles, they reached a&#xD;
-scene which had probably never before&#xD;
been witnessed by civilized or semi-civil.&#xD;
-ized eyes. But there it was, and the re-&#xD;
port of the robbers with regard to it has&#xD;
since been abundantly confirmed., It&#xD;
was simply a huge mounfin, as com-&#xD;
pared with the surrounding objects, ris-&#xD;
ing say'some fifteen hundred feet in&#xD;
height and terribly excoriated, if we&#xD;
may so use the term, by the demon of&#xD;
fire. Like a vulgar monster, sick at its&#xD;
stomach, it continually vomited forth&#xD;
from numbers of mouths large volumes&#xD;
of mud and steam; a regular mud vol-&#xD;
,cano ; and, in its belchings, it sent forth&#xD;
different colors of mud-scarlet, yellow&#xD;
and indigo, which, thick and glutinous,&#xD;
rolled dowi its sides and hardened.&#xD;
Near its base there was an opening which&#xD;
they had not at first observed, it being&#xD;
on the opposite side, which revealed a&#xD;
tremendous boiling pool, forty feet long&#xD;
by twenty feet wide, 'nd reaching down&#xD;
into cavernous depths from which low&#xD;
rumblings came up like muttered thun-&#xD;
der. The ground was hot for a mile&#xD;
around this mud monster, and all the&#xD;
small peaks adjacent were heated. This&#xD;
region, so apochryphal then, has since&#xD;
been thoroughly explored, and the cele-&#xD;
brated "Silver Mountain" of the Coso&#xD;
mines lies to the north of the spot de-,&#xD;
scribed, about-twenty-five miles.&#xD;
On the edge of the big cauldron above&#xD;
named the party saw tracks of naked&#xD;
feet, and the bones of rabbits," and such&#xD;
small deer," which had be6n'apparently&#xD;
cooked on the heated rocks that formthe&#xD;
rim of the cavern. There was, doubt.&#xD;
less, a tribe of people somewhere in the&#xD;
vicinity who adopted this unique mode&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
of converting the sublime and terrible&#xD;
into the useful. Following the tracks&#xD;
over the crispy ground, and circling the&#xD;
bed of an extensive lagoon, now dry,&#xD;
they reached a footpath and descended&#xD;
suddenly, and with a transition truly&#xD;
wonderful, into an exceedingly beautiful&#xD;
valley; and here was an Indian village.&#xD;
The inhabitants were entirely naked,&#xD;
men, women and children, of pigmy size,&#xD;
very dirty, and altogether a very inferior&#xD;
specimen of the sufficiently inferior Root&#xD;
Digger race of California. This tribe&#xD;
live on lizards, crickets, roots and worms,&#xD;
fish and occasional rabbits which they&#xD;
snare. Giving these poor creatures a&#xD;
few presents, the bandits passed on in&#xD;
the path which led through the village,&#xD;
and reaching the pine-clad spurs of the&#xD;
eastern slope, were gratified 'with the&#xD;
sight of what is now known as Owen's&#xD;
Lake, a body of water filling a huge&#xD;
basin scooped out for it in the elevated&#xD;
land. It is forty miles long and from&#xD;
five to ten miles wide. The waters are&#xD;
clear and brackish, and abound in fish.&#xD;
On one of the streams putting into this&#xD;
lake the robbersfixed their camp. . They&#xD;
were supplied with fish by the Indians,&#xD;
and hunters of the party brought from&#xD;
the hills, 4ot unfrequently, anms of deer&#xD;
and antelope. Here the -obbers rested&#xD;
and luxuriated, converting the Indians&#xD;
into servants, laughing at their oddities,&#xD;
and riding or strolling around at their&#xD;
pleasure. In one of his excursions out&#xD;
into the weird realm, upon whose con-&#xD;
fines he was quartered, Joaquin noticed&#xD;
on a wall of cliffs sculptured figures, of&#xD;
life size, of men and animals. They ap.&#xD;
peared to be ancient, and rude as they&#xD;
were, were certainly above any art in the&#xD;
possession of the miserable race then&#xD;
living in those parts. He also found, in&#xD;
an obscure crevice, a rough earthern pot,&#xD;
in which a horned frog had taken up his&#xD;
abode. For how many centuries he had&#xD;
lived there, a venerable hermit, it would&#xD;
be hard to tell. Similar earthen potshave&#xD;

THE ROBBERS GO INTO SAN JOAQUIN&#xD;
COUNTY-GENEROSITY OF MURIETA.&#xD;
In this locality, described in the last&#xD;
chapter, the banditti remained until the&#xD;
end of the month of September, when&#xD;
they obtained an Indian guide to lead&#xD;
them through the mountain passes of&#xD;
that quarter, over to the western slope&#xD;
of the Sierra Nevada. The guide 'took&#xD;
them through a broken mass of volcanic'&#xD;
ground to a deep gorge, now known as&#xD;
Copper Cafilon. The passage is only&#xD;
wide enough, in many places, for a man&#xD;
to ride through, and the rocks tower up'&#xD;
on each side to a height of three hundred&#xD;
feet. Thence he led them through some&#xD;
rugged mountain spurs into the Mescal&#xD;
Valley.  Thence to another patch of&#xD;
crisped and blackened soil into a second&#xD;
lovely valley, whose name I have for-&#xD;
gotten, but which is five miles long and&#xD;
well watered; thence over a gradual&#xD;
rise, into Kern Pass; thence down the&#xD;
western slope of the Sierra Nevada;&#xD;
&#xD;
thence along the low, wooded foot-hills&#xD;
that skirt the Tulare River, Here they-&#xD;
were within sixty miles of the little&#xD;
town of Visalia, and here, they being-&#xD;
then well acquainted with the country,.&#xD;
the guide left them.&#xD;
From this point Joaquin despatched&#xD;
Valenzuela to the Arroyo Cantoova,.&#xD;
there to make encampment and collect&#xD;
herds of horses. He himself with Claudio,&#xD;
Three-Fingered lack and the rest of the&#xD;
band, struck over into San Luis Obispo,&#xD;
county, with fifty followers he rested at&#xD;
the Mission of San Luis Obispo, where&#xD;
he recounted the adventures related in&#xD;
the preceding chapter. A portion of his-&#xD;
band in a short time went over and&#xD;
stopped at Santa Margarita, about fifteen&#xD;
or twenty miles distant. There were&#xD;
persons connected with both of these.&#xD;
extensive ranchos who knew more&#xD;
aboutJoaquin's concerns than they.cared.&#xD;
to acknowledge.&#xD;
While at San Luis Obispo, Joaquin one&#xD;
day took up the Los Angeles hta/, and&#xD;
was. reading the news, when his sight.&#xD;
seemed suddenly blasted, and he let the&#xD;
paper fall from his hands.&#xD;
His affrighted mistress-sprang to his&#xD;
side, and clasping his hands, begged&#xD;
him to tell what was the matter. He.&#xD;
shook his'head for a moment, and the&#xD;
tears gushed from his eyes-aye, robber&#xD;
as he was-as he exclaimed, with quiver-&#xD;
ing lips:&#xD;
"i Rosita, you will never see your broth-&#xD;
er again. Reyes Feliz is dead. He was&#xD;
hung two days ago by the people of&#xD;
Los Angeles."I&#xD;
Pierced with anguish, the fair girl&#xD;
sunk upon his bosom, and from her dark&#xD;
eyes, overshadowedby the rich, luxuriant&#xD;
hair, which fell around her like a mid-&#xD;
night cloud, the storm of her grief poured&#xD;
itself forth in fast and burning drops,&#xD;
which fell like molten lead upon her&#xD;
lover's heart. Why should I describe it?&#xD;
It is well that woman should, like a&#xD;
weeping angel, sanctify our dark and&#xD;
suffering world with her teaTs. Let&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
them flow. The blood which stains the&#xD;
fair face of our mother Earth may not&#xD;
be washed out with an ocean of tears.&#xD;
It was indeed true that Reyes Feliz,&#xD;
in his seventeenth year, had met with&#xD;
what is almost always the outlaw's fate&#xD;
-an ignominious death upon the gal-&#xD;
lows. Having recovered from his wounds,&#xD;
he left San Gabriel and went down to&#xD;
Los Angeles, attended by his faithful&#xD;
Carmelita, where he had been only a few&#xD;
days before he was recognized by an&#xD;
American as one of a party who had once-&#xD;
robbed him in the vicinity of Mokelumne&#xD;
Hill, Standing without the least suspi-&#xD;
cion of danger, in a "fandango house"&#xD;
at Los Angeles, he was suddenly arrest-&#xD;
ed and covered with irons; he was&#xD;
charged with being a party to the assas-&#xD;
sination of General Bean, and although&#xD;
no evidence appeared to'implicate him&#xD;
In this transaction, yet enough was elici-&#xD;
ted to show that he' was undoubtedly a&#xD;
thief and a murderer. He was according-&#xD;
ly taken to the gallows, where he kissed&#xD;
the crucifix and made oath that he was&#xD;
innocent of the murder of General Bean,&#xD;
but guilty in many other instances.&#xD;
Though doomed to die at so early an&#xD;
age; young, healthy and full ofthe fine&#xD;
spirits which give a charm to early man-&#xD;
hood; beloved as men are seldom loved;&#xD;
a wild untameable boy; he quailed not&#xD;
in the presence of death, but faced it with&#xD;
a calm brow and tranquil smile. 'There&#xD;
came over him no shudder or paleness&#xD;
as the rope was adjusted around his neck,&#xD;
and he himself leaped from the platform&#xD;
just as it was about to fall from under&#xD;
him. Alas, for the unfortunate Carmel-&#xD;
ita ! She wandered alone in the woods,&#xD;
weeping and tearing her hair, and many&#xD;
a startled ear caught the wail of her&#xD;
,voice at midnight in the forest. She fled&#xD;
at the approach of a human footstep, but&#xD;
at last they found her cold- and ghastly&#xD;
form stretched on a barren rock, in the&#xD;
still beauty of death. The Mexicans&#xD;
buried her by the side of her well belov-&#xD;
ed Feliz, and the winds shall whisper as&#xD;
&#xD;
JOAQUIN MURIETA.&#xD;
&#xD;
mournfully over their graves, as if the&#xD;
purest and best of mortal dust reposed&#xD;
below. All-loving Nature is no respecter&#xD;
of persons, and takes to her bosom all&#xD;
her children, when they have ceased&#xD;
their wanderings, and eases their heart-&#xD;
aches in her embracing arms. We may&#xD;
go down to our graves with the scorn of&#xD;
an indignant world upon us, which hurls&#xD;
us from its presence-but the eternal God&#xD;
allows no fragment of our souls, no atom&#xD;
of our dust, to be lost from our universe.&#xD;
Poised on our own immortality, we may&#xD;
defy the human race and all that exists&#xD;
beneath the throne of God!   -&#xD;
A few days after the distressing news&#xD;
which they had heard, Joaquin and his&#xD;
sweet Rosita were sitting in front of an&#xD;
old building at the Mission, enjoying, as&#xD;
well as they could, the cool of the even-&#xD;
ing-for the month of November was&#xD;
still pleasant in the southern counties-&#xD;
when a Mexican rode up on a gallop, and&#xD;
hastily dismounted. : He advanced to-&#xD;
ward Joaquin, who rose at his approach&#xD;
and, seeing that he was a stranger, gave&#xD;
him the secret sign by which any mem-&#xD;
ber of the organizationmight recognize&#xD;
another, though they had never met.' It&#xD;
was satisfactorily returned, and the&#xD;
stranger immediately inquired for Joa-&#xD;
quin, and expressed a wish to see him.&#xD;
He was of course informed that he was&#xD;
addressing that individual himself,&#xD;
whereupon he proceeded to unfold the&#xD;
object of his mission.&#xD;
"I am," said he, " most worthy Senor,&#xD;
deputed by a person whom you wot of,&#xD;
residing near the rancho of Gen. Pio&#xD;
Pico, to say to you that there is danger&#xD;
where you now are. A party of Ameri-&#xD;
cans, well armed and mounted, have&#xD;
passed the rancho Los C6yotes in- this&#xD;
direction, and it is no doubt their inten-&#xD;
tyon to surprise you at your present re-&#xD;
treat. I'myself passed them this morn-&#xD;
ing, without being perceived, encamped&#xD;
about fifteen miles from this place, and&#xD;
I seriously believe that you had better&#xD;
look out."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7584-00000020"/>&#xD;
36 .&#xD;
&#xD;
"Very well," replied the chief, with-&#xD;
1/    out changing countenance, "this is as&#xD;
good as I want; hold yourself in readi.&#xD;
ness to serve me as a guide to their&#xD;
encampment, for I intend to surprise&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Summoning Three-Fingered Jack and&#xD;
Claudio, he informed them of the facts&#xD;
which he had heard, and of his inten-&#xD;
tions, directingthem to prepare the band&#xD;
immediately for action. In an hour&#xD;
afterwards the different members came&#xD;
galloping up from various parts of the&#xD;
rancho, booted, spurred and equipped in&#xD;
brilliant style, to the number of forty-five&#xD;
men. They were fine looking fellows,&#xD;
and scarcely any of them over thirty-five&#xD;
years of age. Under the guide of the&#xD;
Los Coyotes messenger, who was fur-&#xD;
nished with a fresh horse, they started&#xD;
just as night set in upon their danger-&#xD;
ous expedition. After a ride of two&#xD;
hours and a half they arrived at their&#xD;
destination. The fires were still burning,&#xD;
but the camp was abandoned. It was&#xD;
too dark to follow a trail, and they&#xD;
stopped for the night. At daybreak&#xD;
thby arose, mounted their horses and&#xD;
pursued a very fresh trail which led&#xD;
through the woods, as if carefully to&#xD;
avoid the main roads. By the number&#xD;
of tracks it was evident that they were"&#xD;
in pursuit of a strong force. . The trail&#xD;
led precisely in the course of San Luis&#xD;
Obispo, and it was apparent that the&#xD;
Americans had started for that place&#xD;
about the same time that Joaquin had,&#xD;
left it; but he having traveled the main&#xD;
road, thus missed them on the way.&#xD;
Arriving at ten o'clock within two miles&#xD;
of the Mission, he halted and sent a spy&#xD;
forward to examine and report, who re-.&#xD;
turned in a short time with the informa-&#xD;
tion that the party, consisting of fifty,&#xD;
men, had left the Mission at daylight on&#xD;
that morning, with the evident purpose&#xD;
of taking the beaten road straight back&#xD;
to their encampment of the day before,&#xD;
the tracks of the banditti being still&#xD;
fresh on the ground. It was plain there-&#xD;
&#xD;
fore, that finding unmistakable indica-&#xD;
tions that the bandits had stayed at their&#xD;
encampment, and had' followed their&#xD;
trail toward the Mission,' they would&#xD;
hurry on to overtake them, and would&#xD;
be able to make the entire circuit before&#xD;
sundown of that day. The young chief&#xD;
clapped his hands together in perfect&#xD;
glee.&#xD;
"We have them boys! we have got&#xD;
them dead!"&#xD;
He wheeled his horse directly around,&#xD;
and led-his company' about three miles&#xD;
back on the trail which they had just&#xD;
come, and halted at the junction of two&#xD;
deep gulches, rugged and shaggy with&#xD;
overhanging rocks. - Directing his men&#xD;
to hide their horses at &amp;amp;distance of three&#xD;
or four hundred yards from the trail, he&#xD;
ordered them next to conceal themselves&#xD;
in the nooks and crevices of the surround-&#xD;
ing bluffs. They lay there as still as&#xD;
deatlr for about two hours,' when the&#xD;
clatter of horses' feet was heard distinct-&#xD;
ly in the distance. Nearer and nearer,&#xD;
they came, and in a few minutes a fine&#xD;
looking young man, with blue eyes and&#xD;
light hair, rode up within twenty yards&#xD;
of Joaquin, followed by about fifty other&#xD;
Americans, armed with rifles and revol-&#xD;
vers.&#xD;
" I don't like the looks of this place at&#xD;
all,"' said the young man, and hardly&#xD;
had the words escaped his lips, 'before&#xD;
the rocks blazed around him, and the&#xD;
sharp reports of twenty or thirty pistols&#xD;
rang in his ears. His hat was shot from&#xD;
his head, and his horse fell under him.&#xD;
A dozen of his followers bit the dust.&#xD;
"Dismount, boys, and scald the rocks!&#xD;
Give them no advantage! Fage them&#xD;
in their very teeth ! It is our only&#xD;
chance."&#xD;
They 'sprang to the rocks at the word,&#xD;
each man to the quarter which he chose,&#xD;
and hand to hand bearded their hidden&#xD;
foes in their dens. It could scarcely be&#xD;
called a battle between two distinct&#xD;
forces rit was rather a number of separ-&#xD;
ate single combats, in which nothing&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
31&#xD;
&#xD;
could avail a man but'his own right arm&#xD;
and dauntless heart. Joaquin sprang&#xD;
from his hiding place to have a freer&#xD;
sweep of his arm, when he met at the&#xD;
very threshold the young Anglo Saxon.&#xD;
A flash of recognition passed between&#xD;
them, and Joaquin turned as if to leap&#xD;
upon a rock at his right, but at the mo-&#xD;
ment that his antagonist jumped in that&#xD;
direction to intercept the movement, he&#xD;
wheeled to the left, and throwing out&#xD;
his foot with a sudden and vigorous&#xD;
stroke, knocked the young man's heels&#xD;
' from under him, and he fell with violence&#xD;
upon his face. Before he could rise, the&#xD;
wily bandit leaped upon him like a pan-&#xD;
ther, and sheathed his knife in his heart.&#xD;
It was too sad, but as I have said before,&#xD;
an invisible guardian fiend pursued ev-&#xD;
erywhere this extraordinary man. Hav-&#xD;
ing no time to repeat the blow, especi-&#xD;
ally as it seemed unnecessary, he drew&#xD;
forth the dripping blade, and rushed to&#xD;
another scene of the conflict. He was&#xD;
met at almost every step, and fought his&#xD;
way like a tiger, gashed and bleeding,&#xD;
but still strong and unfainting. Dead&#xD;
men lay upon every side, both Amer-&#xD;
cans and Mexicans, and in front of Three-&#xD;
Fingered Jack were stretched five men,&#xD;
with their skulls broken by the butt end&#xD;
of his revolver, which he had used as a&#xD;
club after emptying its contents, and at&#xD;
the moment that Joaquin's eye met him,&#xD;
he was stooping, with glaring eyes and&#xD;
a hideous smile, over a prostrate Ameri-&#xD;
can, in whose long hair he had wound&#xD;
his left hand, and across whose throat he&#xD;
was drawing the coarse-grained steel of&#xD;
his huge home-made bowie knife. With&#xD;
a shout of delight he severed the neck&#xD;
joint and threw the gaping head over&#xD;
the rocks, He was crazy with the sight&#xD;
of blood, and searched eagerly for an-&#xD;
other victim. He scarcely knew his lead-&#xD;
er, and the latter had called to him three&#xD;
times before he recovered his senses.&#xD;
"Ah, Muriet," said he, smacking his&#xD;
-lips, "this has been a great day. Damn&#xD;
'em! how my knife lapped up their blood."&#xD;
&#xD;
JOAQUIN MURrETA.&#xD;

&#xD;
The fight now having lasted half an&#xD;
hour, and there being no 'prospect that&#xD;
either party would conquer, so equally&#xD;
were they matched,' it gradually sub-&#xD;
sided, and each side gradually drew ofT&#xD;
from the other, with a tacit understand-&#xD;
ing that they were mutually satisfied to&#xD;
cry quits. Joaquin looked around and&#xD;
saw that he had lost twenty men, among&#xD;
whom was the invaluable Claudio, and&#xD;
ascertained the loss of his enemies to be&#xD;
very near the same, perhaps a little over.&#xD;
Mounting their horses, the bandits rode&#xD;
off in silence toward San Luis Obispo,&#xD;
while the surviving Americans found as&#xD;
many of their horses as had not left&#xD;
them during the conflict, and retired to&#xD;
their homes in'Santa Barbara, County,&#xD;
having made arrangements on the way&#xD;
for the burial of their deceased comrades.&#xD;
During the following night a company&#xD;
from the Mission went over to the bloody&#xD;
scene with picks and shovels, and buried&#xD;
the dead bodies of the bandits near the&#xD;
spot where they fell. On the next morn-&#xD;
ing Joaquin summoned the Los Coyotes&#xD;
messenger, and said to him:&#xD;
" Go back and. tell my friend, who&#xD;
sent'you, that the 'danger is passed, -and&#xD;
hand him'this purse. For yourself, take&#xD;
this one," handing him another well-&#xD;
filled bag.&#xD;
Attention having being attracted to&#xD;
the San Luis Obispo rancho, the bandit&#xD;
thought it prudent to go elsewhere.&#xD;
Accordingly word was sent over to their&#xD;
friends - who were rusticating at Santa&#xD;
Margarita, to join them, and they forth-&#xD;
with started to a well known harboring&#xD;
place not more than a thousand miles&#xD;
from Jose Ramune Carrejo's rancho.&#xD;
ilere they remained until such as were&#xD;
wounded recovered their usual health&#xD;
and strength-and here, again, Joaquin&#xD;
heard news similar to that which shocked&#xD;
him at San Luis Obispo, namely, that&#xD;
Mountain Jim had been hung at San&#xD;
Diego. This misfortune happened to the&#xD;
jolly robber from his own carelessness.&#xD;
He and Valenzuela had stopped at a&#xD;

&#xD;
drinking shop on the San Diego River&#xD;
some fifteen or twenty miles from th&#xD;
bay of that name, and had taken a glase&#xD;
of execrable brandy, when a party of four&#xD;
or five Americans rode up and alighted,&#xD;
who looked so very suspiciously at&#xD;
Valenzuela and partner, that the former&#xD;
took his friend out, and told him that it&#xD;
was his opinion they both had better&#xD;
leave as quick as possible. Mountain&#xD;
Jim was under the influence of liquor,&#xD;
and laughing at what he chose to term the&#xD;
silly fears of Valenzuela, he went back&#xD;
Into the house swearing and swagger-&#xD;
ing. Pretty soon after, a dozen more&#xD;
Americans approached on horseback, see-&#xD;
ing whom, Valenzuela mounted into his&#xD;
saddle and called to Jim to come along.&#xD;
But Jim only laughed, and took another&#xD;
glass of liquor.&#xD;
"Curse the foolI" muttered the ban-&#xD;
dit, " he will. be the death of both of us.&#xD;
For my part, I will keep my own dis-&#xD;
tance from those scurvy looking fellows,&#xD;
at any rate." -&#xD;
The new party no sooner arrived than&#xD;
they rushed up to the door of the drink-&#xD;
ing house and drew their revolvers-a&#xD;
scuffle ensued inside,and Valenzuela, well&#xD;
aware of what was going on, and that it&#xD;
was uselessto contend against such great&#xD;
odds, merely fired one shot into the&#xD;
crowd at the door, which took effect in the&#xD;
abdomen of one of the party, and wheel-&#xD;
ing his horse broke off like a thunder-&#xD;
bolt. - Several of the Americans.pursued&#xD;
him, but his fine, swift animal distanced&#xD;
them so far, that they might as well have&#xD;
attempted to catch the red-winged spirit&#xD;
of a storm. Poor Mountain Jim! He&#xD;
was never destined to tread the moun-&#xD;
tains again. He was taken to the town&#xD;
of San Diego, and hung with as little&#xD;
ceremony as if he had been adog. Well&#xD;
fitted was he to grace a gallows, for his&#xD;
merits certainly entitled him to a distin-&#xD;
guished elevation.&#xD;
From his present stopping place Joa-&#xD;
quin sent messenger,oabout the first of&#xD;
December, to the Arroyo Cantoova. to&#xD;
&#xD;
see Valeuzuela, if he was there, and if he&#xD;
e was absent to await his return, in order&#xD;
s  to inform him that it was made his duty&#xD;
to continue the business in which he was&#xD;
engaged, through the entire winter, or&#xD;
until such time as Joaquin should arrive&#xD;
at the rendezvous. The messenger re-&#xD;
turned after a few days and stated that&#xD;
he had iound Valenzuela and band at the&#xD;
Arroyo, with tents pitched, and a herd&#xD;
of fine horses amounting to between five&#xD;
and six hundred, feeding on the pasture,&#xD;
and that the bold leader had signified a&#xD;
willing obedience to his chief's mandate.&#xD;
"He is a glorious fellow," exclaimed&#xD;
' Joaquin.  "He didn't practice under&#xD;
that hardened old priest, Jurata, without&#xD;
learning something."&#xD;
Spies were now ranging the country&#xD;
every day, picking up valuable informa-&#xD;
tion; and among other things, it was-&#xD;
ascertained that an opinion prevailed&#xD;
that Joaquin had gone to the State of&#xD;
Sonora.' Thinking it a favorable time,&#xD;
he issued forth with his whole force, uni.&#xD;
ting Three-Fingered Jack's party with&#xD;
Claudio's, which last was now under the&#xD;
leadership of a member of the band&#xD;
named Reis-and startedlip into Mari-&#xD;
posa county for the purpose of plunder.&#xD;
On the. road that leads from Dead&#xD;
Man's Creek to the Merced River, he met&#xD;
four Frenchmen, six Germans and three&#xD;
Americans, walking and driving mules&#xD;
before them, packed with provisions,&#xD;
blankets and mining utensils.rHaving&#xD;
so large a party with him, numbering&#xD;
about thirty men, he had no difficulty in&#xD;
stopping the travelers as long as he&#xD;
wished to detain them. His men stood&#xD;
around with pistols cocked, while Joa-&#xD;
quin dismounted, and walking up to a&#xD;
terrified Frenchman, 'who was armed&#xD;
-with a revolver which he was afraid to&#xD;
use, took him by the top of his head, and&#xD;
jerked him around once or twice, slapped&#xD;
*him across the face with his open hand,&#xD;
andtold him to '-shell out." TheFrench-&#xD;
man hauled out  well-filled purseoand&#xD;
was handing it over, when others of his&#xD;
&#xD;
.4&#xD;
&#xD;
-companions made a show to draw their&#xD;
pistols and defend their gold dust. The&#xD;
robbers were too quick for them, and &#xD;
more than half of the unfortunate miners&#xD;
were shot down in their tracks. Joaquin&#xD;
brandished his glittering blade in the&#xD;
faces of the survivors, and threatened to&#xD;
to cut every one of their windpipes if&#xD;
they didn't hand out " what little loose&#xD;
change " they had about them, in half a,&#xD;
minute I His polite request was com-&#xD;
plied with, and the little loose change&#xD;
.amounted to about $15,000. He then&#xD;
bestowed a kick or two on some of the&#xD;
.number as a parting tribute of regard,&#xD;
:and told them to "roll on." Three-Fin-&#xD;
gered Jack insisted on killing the whole&#xD;
'company, but the clgef overruled him.&#xD;
Riding forward after this transaction,&#xD;
they had not gone more than two miles&#xD;
when they met a Chinaman with a long&#xD;
'tail, carrying a large bundle suspended&#xD;
at each end of a stick laid across his&#xD;
shoulders, walking leisurely along with&#xD;
his head bent to the ground. Looking,&#xD;
up and seeing so large a number of armed&#xD;
men before him, his eyes rolled in sud-&#xD;
den fear,.and he ducked his half shaved&#xD;
head in -nmistakable homage and re-&#xD;
spect to-the revolvers and bowie knives&#xD;
which met his vision. No one harmed&#xD;
him, and he shuffled on vastly gratified&#xD;
and relieved. He had passed only a few&#xD;
minutes when he was heard howling&#xD;
and screaming in the most harrowing&#xD;
manner; and looking back they .discov-&#xD;
ered the horrified Celestial, with his tail&#xD;
flying in the wind, running toward them&#xD;
.at the top of his speed, with arms saw-&#xD;
ing the air, and bundle le88, while the&#xD;
ground clattered under his wooden shoes;&#xD;
and just behind him, with blazing eyes,&#xD;
and his huge home-mad6 knife in his&#xD;
right hand, appeared Three-Fingered&#xD;
-Jack, who had stopped at a spring and&#xD;
was.tying his horse to a bush at the mo-&#xD;
ment that the Chinaman came up. It&#xD;
-was toogood an opportunity to be lost,&#xD;
andhe darted likea wild hyena at the&#xD;
astounded Oriental, who applied himself&#xD;
&#xD;
to his heels with the utmost vigor that&#xD;
he could command. Joaquin bowed him-&#xD;
self upon the saddle in a convulsion of&#xD;
laughter at the ridiculous appearance of&#xD;
the Chinaman, but speedily confronted&#xD;
Jack and told him to stop. Woh Le fell&#xD;
upon his knees in deepest adoration of&#xD;
his preserver. Joaquin bade him go on&#xD;
his way, and laughingly reprimanded&#xD;
Jack for wanting to kill so pitiful a look-&#xD;
ing creature.&#xD;
"Well," said Jack, "I can't help it;&#xD;
but, somehow or other, I love to smell&#xD;
the blood of a Chinaman. Besides, it's&#xD;
such easy work-to kill them. It's a kind&#xD;
of luxury to cut their throats."&#xD;
Proceeding across the woods and moun-&#xD;
tains, the banditti n a few days struck&#xD;
the main road leading from the town of&#xD;
Mariposa to Stockton, in San Joaquin&#xD;
county. Robbing once in a while as&#xD;
they went along, they arrived late one&#xD;
night at a ferry on the Tuolumne River,&#xD;
Tuolumne county, and finding the boat&#xD;
locked to the shore so that they could&#xD;
not exercise the privilege of crossing&#xD;
themselves which was their usual cus-&#xD;
tom, they rode up to the ferryman's&#xD;
house, and very nearly beat the door&#xD;
down before they could arouse him. He&#xD;
came out at last with a terrified look,&#xD;
and asked what they wanted.&#xD;
"We want to cross the river," replied&#xD;
Joaquin; "and before doing so we wish&#xD;
to obtain from you the loan of wlat&#xD;
spare cash you may have about you. You&#xD;
have the best evidence of the urgency&#xD;
of our request,", cocking his pistol'and&#xD;
presenting it close to the fellow's&#xD;
head.&#xD;
" Never mind the evidence, Sefior; I&#xD;
believe you without it. I will certainly&#xD;
loan you all I have got."&#xD;
So saying, he lighted a candle and got&#xD;
out a purse from under his pillow, con-&#xD;
taining a hundred dollars.&#xD;
" Come, said Jack," bursting a cap at&#xD;
his head, "Iyou have got more;, And was&#xD;
cocking his pistol for another trial, when&#xD;
Joaquin very fiercely told him to know&#xD;

his place. Turning to the trembling&#xD;
ferryman he said: "Isthis all you have&#xD;
got?"&#xD;
Precisely all, Seflor; but you are wel-&#xD;
come to it."&#xD;
"I won't take it," said the young&#xD;
chief, with a flush of pride; "you ate a&#xD;
poor man and never injured me. Put us&#xD;
over the river and I will pay you for your&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
I mention this incident merely to show&#xD;
that Murieta in his worst days had yet&#xD;
a remnant of that noble spirit which had&#xD;
been his original nature, and to correct&#xD;
those who have said that he was lost to&#xD;
every generous sentiment.&#xD;

BANDITS-JOAQUIN REVEALS HIS FU-&#xD;
TURE PLANS- GUERRA'S WIFE BE-&#xD;
COMES RESTIVE-AMERICAN HUNTERS&#xD;
FALL INTO A TRAP-HOW THEY GOT&#xD;
OUT OF IT.&#xD;
The party arrived in the neighborhood&#xD;
of Stockton after two days' travel, and&#xD;
camped on the plain, uuder an oak grove,&#xD;
about three miles from that city. They&#xD;
were seen at their encampment, but not&#xD;
suspected. Indeed it was then, as it is&#xD;
now, so common a thing to see compa-&#xD;
nies of men engaged in the various occu-&#xD;
pations of packers, cattle drovers, horse&#xD;
traders, hunters and the like, stationed&#xD;
by the banks of some cool stream, or rest-&#xD;
ing under the shade of trees at a distance&#xD;
from any 'house, or with their tents&#xD;
pitched in some lonely place for weeks&#xD;
at a time, that it was scarcely just to&#xD;
&#xD;
__~~&#xD;
&#xD;
suspect a: party to be criminal, merely&#xD;
from  circumstances like these.  The&#xD;
knowledge of everybody that it was the'&#xD;
habit among all classes to go armed and&#xD;
to camp out, in every sort of a place,.&#xD;
materially aided the banditti in their-&#xD;
movements, for it gave them the oppor-&#xD;
tunity to remain perfectly, safe until.&#xD;
they chose to avow their real char-,&#xD;
acters by some open outrage and vil-&#xD;
lainy.&#xD;
One fine Sunday morning, while the-&#xD;
bells were 'ringing for church in the&#xD;
goodly city of Stockton, and well-dressed&#xD;
gentlemen were standing at the corners.&#xD;
of the streets, marking with'critical eyes-&#xD;
the glancing feet and the flaunting dres-&#xD;
ses of the ladies who swept by them in&#xD;
the halo of beauty and perfumery, a fine-&#xD;
looking man whom they had never.,seen&#xD;
before-having long, black hair hanging-&#xD;
over his shoulders, and a piercing black&#xD;
eye-rode through the streets, carelessly-&#xD;
looking at the' different objects which.&#xD;
happened to attract his attention. So,&#xD;
finely was he dressed, and so superbly-&#xD;
was his horse comparisoned, that with-&#xD;
out seeming to know it, he was the ob-.&#xD;
served of all observers&#xD;
"What- a splendid looking fellow V"&#xD;
observed the ladies.&#xD;
"He must be a young Mexican gran-&#xD;
dee, at least, on a journey of pleasure,"&#xD;
said one.&#xD;
"I think," said another, "it must be&#xD;
Gen. Vallejo's son."&#xD;
' " I don't believe he has any," said a&#xD;
third; and they became so much interes-&#xD;
ted in their conjectures about the young-&#xD;
man that it is doubtful whether they-&#xD;
paid much attention to the very prosy&#xD;
minister who was then acting- as the,&#xD;
"bright and shining light" amidst the,&#xD;
surrounding darkness.&#xD;
The youthful cavalier, after attracting:&#xD;
uncommon attention, by riding over the&#xD;
city, finally stopped at the side of a&#xD;
house, upon which were posted several&#xD;
notices-one reading as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
JOAQUDT MURIETA.               '41&#xD;
&#xD;
.1&#xD;
&#xD;
"FOR SAIL.&#xD;
"the surseribur ophfers for sail a yauf&#xD;
boterhiclit at the hed- of the Slew terms&#xD;
cash or kabbige turnips and sich like will&#xD;
bea taykenr."&#xD;
To which   fine specimen of polite&#xD;
literature was appended the name of a&#xD;
worthy citizen, who was then fishing for&#xD;
his living, but has since been fishing for&#xD;
various distinguished  offices in that&#xD;
county.&#xD;
Another one was a "notis" that some&#xD;
person either wanted to hire some one&#xD;
else, or be hired himself, as a cook-it&#xD;
was impossible to tell which.&#xD;
A third was an auctioneer's notice.&#xD;
"lonor before the 25 da of Dec I will&#xD;
offur to the hiest bider a brownmuleaate&#xD;
yeer old, a gilding 16hans hie and a span&#xD;
of jack~ consistin of long years and a good&#xD;
voyce."&#xD;
I have a notion to publish the name&#xD;
signed to this rare advertisement, espec-&#xD;
ially as the auctioneer 'seems to have&#xD;
been something of a wag as well as ig-&#xD;
noramus. But, perhaps, it will be bet-&#xD;
ter not. A fourth was headed, in good&#xD;
English, and a fair running hand.&#xD;
"Five Thousand Dollars Reward for Joa-&#xD;
quin-dead or alive."&#xD;
And stated that the citizens of San Joa-&#xD;
quin county offered that amount for the&#xD;
apprehension'or the killing of that noted&#xD;
robber.&#xD;
Seeing this, the young Mexican dis.&#xD;
mounted; and taking out his pencil,&#xD;
wrote something underneath, and leisure-&#xD;
ly rode out of town. No less than a dozen&#xD;
persons, stimulated by curiosity, went to&#xD;
the paper to see what was written, when&#xD;
they read the following in pencil:&#xD;
e" I will give $10,000. Joaquin."&#xD;
Numerous were the exclamations of&#xD;
astonishment at this discovery, and&#xD;
nothing else was talked of for a week,&#xD;
among the ladies at least, who- got hold&#xD;
of the fact almost before it. was die&#xD;
covered, and insisted each to the other&#xD;
that they had remarked that the young&#xD;
man had a peculiarly wild and terrible&#xD;
*See newspapers of that period.&#xD;
&#xD;
JOAQUIT MURIETA.&#xD;
&#xD;
look, and  they  had suspected very&#xD;
strongly though they had never men,&#xD;
tioned it to any one, that it was 'none,&#xD;
other than the noted personage whom it&#xD;
proved to be.&#xD;
Joaquin appeared on this occasion mbis&#xD;
real features. He frequently went after-&#xD;
wards, however,into that city completely&#xD;
disguised, and learned many things im-&#xD;
portant for him to hear. Ascertaining&#xD;
one evening that a schooner would go&#xD;
down the slough in a few hours, bound&#xD;
for San Francisco, on board of which&#xD;
,were two miners from San Andreas, in&#xD;
Calaveras county, with heavy bags of&#xD;
gold dust, who designed to take their&#xD;
departure for the States, he took three&#xD;
of his men who were lounging around&#xD;
town, with him, and jumping into a skiff&#xD;
shot down the slough, and tying up his.&#xD;
boat in a bend of the water, hid in the&#xD;
tues and patiently waited for the schoon-&#xD;
er to come along.  The mosquitoes bit&#xD;
him unmercifully, and he was almost.&#xD;
tempted to abandon the enterprise on&#xD;
their account, but the prospect of so&#xD;
good a haul was, on reflection, not to be&#xD;
resisted. . He cursed , himself for not&#xD;
bringing some matches with which he&#xD;
might have kindled a fire, and sought&#xD;
the protection of its -smoke ; but perse-&#xD;
verance is always rewarded, if the object&#xD;
desired lies in the bounds of possibility,&#xD;
and waiting like a martyr for three mor-&#xD;
tal hours, in those tudes, which are a per-&#xD;
feet "mosquito kingdom," where huge-&#xD;
gallinippers reign as the aristocracy, he-&#xD;
at last saw the white sheeted schooner&#xD;
stealing along in the crooks and turns&#xD;
of jut the crookedet strem  in the wiwle&#xD;
'word, so narrow and so completely hid&#xD;
in its windings by the tall flags which&#xD;
overspread the plains for many miles to&#xD;
the right and left that the white sail&#xD;
looked like a ghost gliding along over&#xD;
-the waving grass. As the vessel came&#xD;
opposite, Joaquin and companions slyoved&#xD;
their boat out into the stream, and tying&#xD;
it to the schooner's side, leaped on board&#xD;
of her, and commenced firing without&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7584-00000023"/>&#xD;
42&#xD;
&#xD;
saying a word. They shot down the&#xD;
two young men who managed the vessel&#xD;
'before they had time to use their double-&#xD;
barreled shot-guns, which they always&#xD;
carried for the purpose of shooting water-&#xD;
fowl in the slough and up the San Joa-&#xD;
quin River, and rushing aft attacked the&#xD;
two miners, who had risen at the the re-&#xD;
port of the pistols, and were-standing&#xD;
with their revolvers drawn and cocked,&#xD;
ready for action. They and the robbers&#xD;
fired simultaneously. Two of Joaquin's&#xD;
men fell dead on the deck, and the&#xD;
miners fell at the same time. Their&#xD;
wallets were soon stripped from them by&#xD;
Joaquin and his surviving companion,&#xD;
and finding some matches, they set fire&#xD;
to the vessel, and left her to burn down.&#xD;
They rowed theirgkiff to the head of the&#xD;
slough in Stockton, and wended their&#xD;
way back to their encampment.'Ere day-&#xD;
light there was no trace of murder on&#xD;
the slough, but a dark hulk which was&#xD;
hardly visible on the water's edge. By&#xD;
this operation Joaquin realized twenty&#xD;
thousand dollars. Having now between&#xD;
forty and fifty thousand dollars in gold&#xD;
dust, he ordered his bands to pack up,&#xD;
and started for the rendezvous of Ar-&#xD;
royo Cantoova, passing by Josd Ramune&#xD;
Carrejo's rancho, and taking the lovely&#xD;
Rosita along with him, who had been&#xD;
staying there during his trip to Stock-&#xD;
ton.&#xD;
He reached the Arroyo about the mid-&#xD;
dle of the day, and it was a beautiful&#xD;
sight that met his eye as he gazed over&#xD;
the extensive valley, and saw a thousand&#xD;
fine horses feeding on the rich grass, ot&#xD;
galloping, with flowing manes and ex-&#xD;
panded nostrils, in graceful circles over&#xD;
the plain.&#xD;
"Valenzuela has done his work well,"&#xD;
said the elated chief, "ten times better&#xD;
than I had expected he would. "&#xD;
Seeing one of his herdsmen looking at&#xD;
him a short distance off as if endeavor-&#xD;
ing to recognize him, he rode up to him&#xD;
and asked him in reference to Valen-&#xD;
suela.*&#xD;
&#xD;
"He has been gone,"-said the vaquero,&#xD;
" about a week-we expect him every&#xD;
d a y . " I+&#xD;
The newly arrived party then rode up&#xD;
to the tents under the trees, and dis-&#xD;
mounted. The busy cooks hurried up&#xD;
the fires, and the fresh venison and bear&#xD;
meat was soon smoking on the irons,&#xD;
and emitting a most delicious savor, such&#xD;
as tempts the appetite of a hardy moun-&#xD;
taineer. Broiledquails and grouse, sweet&#xD;
and oily, the *latter of which had been&#xD;
brought from the,'tall spruce trees at'a&#xD;
height of three hundred feet, by the long&#xD;
maple-stocked and silver-mounted rifles&#xD;
which stood at the corner of one of the&#xD;
tents, were hanging in front of the blaze,&#xD;
suspended by their necks to branching&#xD;
sticks driven into the ground. The hot&#xD;
coffee steamed up from the large pot&#xD;
with a most stimulating 'effect; every-&#xD;
thing was spread forth in superabun-&#xD;
dance, scattered over a large white cloth&#xD;
that covere# a,-few yards square of green&#xD;
grass, and ;t a signal from the cooks,&#xD;
who were also the waiters, forty fierce&#xD;
and hungry brigands sat down, and with&#xD;
the utmost expedition consistent with&#xD;
respect for their leader, made havoc&#xD;
among the victuals. Just at this mo-&#xD;
ment a mounted company dashed up at&#xD;
full speed, giving the well known whoop&#xD;
by which they could be recognized as&#xD;
friends, and dismounted. It was Valen-&#xD;
zuela and a portion of his band, the re-&#xD;
mainder of whom soon after came in,&#xD;
driving two hundred and fifty fine Ameri-&#xD;
can horses before them. The circle was&#xD;
enlarged, the cooks went to work afresh,&#xD;
and soon the whole banditti were seated&#xD;
at theample banquet. Generous wines&#xD;
stood sparkling in their midst, with&#xD;
which scarcely any refused to refresh&#xD;
themselves. Conversation flowed freely,&#xD;
and each one had a tale to tell of liair-&#xD;
breadth escapes and daring deeds.&#xD;
On the following morning Joaquin col-&#xD;
lected his bands arQund him, numbering&#xD;
from a late accession of "fighting mem-&#xD;
bers," as he called them, one hundred&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
men and explained to them fully his,&#xD;
views and purposes..&#xD;
He informed them that he could com-&#xD;
inand, if he desired,'in all two thousand&#xD;
men who were ready to organize in So-&#xD;
nora, Lower California, and in this&#xD;
State, that he had money in abundance&#xD;
deposited in a safe place, meaning with&#xD;
his secret partner in Sonora; that he&#xD;
intended to arm and equip and make a&#xD;
clean sweep of the southern counties;&#xD;
that he intended to kill the Americans&#xD;
by wholesale, burn their ranchos and&#xD;
run off their property, at one single&#xD;
swoop, so rapidly that they would' not&#xD;
have time to collect an opposing force&#xD;
before he would have finished the work&#xD;
and found safety in the mountains of&#xD;
Sonora; that when he had done this he&#xD;
would wind up his career, divide his&#xD;
substance with the band now attending&#xD;
him, and spend the rest of his days in&#xD;
peace; that he was now preparing for&#xD;
this grand climax, and that this was the&#xD;
reason that -he had been so steadily col-&#xD;
lecting horses.&#xD;
These avowals leaked out through&#xD;
persons not sufficiently reticent on the&#xD;
ranches in the habit of harboring Joa-&#xD;
quin, and came to the .ears of Captain&#xD;
Harry Love, whom we have before men-&#xD;
tioned, and others, causing them to use&#xD;
renewed exertions to capture or slay- the&#xD;
daring robber.&#xD;
The-banditti shouted in loud applause&#xD;
of their gallant leader. Their eyes kin-&#xD;
dled with enthusiasm at the magnificent&#xD;
prospect- which he presented to them,&#xD;
and they could scarcely contain them-&#xD;
selves in view of the astounding revela-&#xD;
tions which he had made. They had&#xD;
entertained no 'adequate idea of the&#xD;
splendid genius which belonged to their&#xD;
chief, although they had loved and ad-&#xD;
mired him throughout his dangerous&#xD;
career. They were fired with new ener-&#xD;
gy, and more than ever willing and anx-&#xD;
ious to obey him at all hazards, and&#xD;
under the most disadvantageous circum-&#xD;
stances.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
On this same day he dispatched a re-&#xD;
mittance of $50,000 to his secret partner&#xD;
in Sonora, under, a strong . force com-&#xD;
manded by Valenzuela, and directed&#xD;
Three-Fingered Jack, with fifty men, to&#xD;
drive off to the same State a thousand&#xD;
head of the horses which had been col-&#xD;
lected. Joaquin was accordingly left at&#xD;
the rendezvous, with twenty-five men,&#xD;
who had nothing todo but kill game,&#xD;
and attend to their horses, and clean their&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
The widow of Gonzalez, and present&#xD;
wife of the brute Guerra, who looked&#xD;
more like a grizzly bear than a human&#xD;
being, wished to go off with Three-Fin-&#xD;
gered Jack, but Guerra begged his bro-&#xD;
ther bandit, of whom he was afraid, so&#xD;
hard to leave her with him that Jack&#xD;
forced her to stay. Guerra was by no&#xD;
means so kind to her as Gonzalez had&#xD;
been, and one night while he was asleep&#xD;
she was about to cut his throat, when&#xD;
Joaquin, who was lying in the same tent.&#xD;
fiercely told her to behave herself, and&#xD;
assured her with, an emphasis that he&#xD;
would hold her responsible if Guerra&#xD;
was ever found dead about camp. She&#xD;
threw her knife spitefully toward Jea-&#xD;
quin and laid down again by her adora-&#xD;
ble spouse, who snored in blissful ignor-&#xD;
auce of his wife's affectionate purpose.&#xD;
Lounging in his tent one misty day-.&#xD;
for the rainy season had set in-Joaquin&#xD;
was aroused from the luxurious lap of&#xD;
his mistress by one of his sentinels, who&#xD;
galloped up and informed him that he&#xD;
had just discovered a fresh trail through&#xD;
the grass, about a mile and a half below&#xD;
on the Cantoova Creek, and from appear-&#xD;
ances he should judge there were eight&#xD;
or ten men. It was important to keep&#xD;
a sharp lookout, and to allow no Ameri-&#xD;
cans to leave that valley with the knowl-&#xD;
edge that it was occupied by any body&#xD;
of men whatever, as such a circumstance&#xD;
would materially interfere with the gi-&#xD;
gantic plans projected. Accordingly, it&#xD;
was not long before Joaquin was mount-&#xD;
cd upon one of his swiftest horses and&#xD;
&#xD;
JOAQUIN MURIETA'&#xD;

44              JOAQUIN MtRIETA.&#xD;
&#xD;
accompanied by fifteen picked men.&#xD;
They proceeded to the-trail indicated by&#xD;
the sentinel and rode rapidly for two&#xD;
hours, which brought them insight of&#xD;
ten Americans, who halted in curious sur-&#xD;
prise and waited for them to come up.&#xD;
"Who are you?" said Joaquin, "and&#xD;
what is your business in these parts?"&#xD;
They replied that they were hunters&#xD;
in search of bears and deer.&#xD;
"We are hunters, also," rejoined the&#xD;
bandit, " and are camped just across the&#xD;
plain here. Come over with us, and let&#xD;
us have a chat. Besides, we have some&#xD;
first rate liquor at our camp."&#xD;
Suspecting nothing wrong, the hun-&#xD;
ters accompanied them, and having dis-&#xD;
nhounted at the tents and turned out&#xD;
their horses to graze, found themselves&#xD;
suddenly in a very doubtful position.&#xD;
They were 'surrounded by a company&#xD;
more than double their own, who made&#xD;
demonstrations not at all grateful to&#xD;
their sight, aid in a few moments they&#xD;
realized the bitter fact that they were&#xD;
driven to the extremity of a hopeless&#xD;
struggle for their lives. They remon-&#xD;
strated with Joaquin against so shame-&#xD;
less an act as the cold-blooded murder of&#xD;
men who had never injured him.&#xD;
"Yibu have found me here," he replied,&#xD;
"and I have no guarantee that you will&#xD;
not betray me. If I do not tell you who I&#xD;
am, you will think it no harm to say you&#xD;
have seen a man of my description; and&#xD;
if I do tell you, then you will be certain&#xD;
to mention it at the first opportunity."&#xD;
At this moment a young man, original- -&#xD;
ly from the wilds of Arkansas, not more&#xD;
than eighteen years of age, advanced in&#xD;
front of his trembling comrades, and&#xD;
standing faee to face with the robber&#xD;
chief, addressed him in a firm voice to&#xD;
the following effect:-.&#xD;
"I suspect strongly who you are, sir. ,&#xD;
I am satisfied that you are Joaquin Muri-&#xD;
eta. I am also satisfied that you are a;a&#xD;
brave man, who would-not unnecessarily  l&#xD;
commit murder. You would not wish     f&#xD;
to take our lives unless your own safety  l&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
JOAQVIN MLRIETA.               4&#xD;
&#xD;
demanded it. I do npt blame   o, foI&#xD;
lowing the business you do, for desiring&#xD;
to put an effectual seal of silence on our&#xD;
tongues. But listen to me just a mo-&#xD;
ment. You see that I am no coward. I )&#xD;
do not look at you with the aspect of a&#xD;
man, who would tell a falsehood to save&#xD;
his life. I promise you faithfully for my.&#xD;
self, and in behalf of my companions,&#xD;
that if you spare our lives, which are&#xD;
completely In your power, not a word&#xD;
shall be breathed of your whereabouts.&#xD;
I will myself kill the first man who says&#xD;
a word in regard to it. Under different&#xD;
circumstances I should take-a different ,&#xD;
course, but now, I am conscious that to&#xD;
spare our lives, it will be an act of mag-&#xD;
nanimity on your part, and I stake my&#xD;
honor, not as an American citizen, but&#xD;
as a man, who is simply bound by jus-&#xD;
tice to himself, under circumstances in&#xD;
which no other considerations can pre-&#xD;
vail, that you shall not be betrayed. If&#xD;
you say you will spare us, we thank you.&#xD;
If you say no, we can only fight till we&#xD;
die, and you must lbse some of your&#xD;
lives in the conflict."&#xD;
Joaquin drew his hand across his broW,&#xD;
and looked thoughtful and undecided.&#xD;
A beautiful female approached him from&#xD;
the tent near by, and touched him on&#xD;
the shoulder.&#xD;
"Spare them, Joaquin,   she tremu-&#xD;
lously whiappred, and looking at him&#xD;
with pleading eyes, retired softly to her&#xD;
seat again.&#xD;
liaising his fine head with a lofty look,&#xD;
he bent his large clear eyes upon the&#xD;
young American as if he would read him&#xD;
like an outspread page. He answered his&#xD;
glance with a look so royally sincere that&#xD;
Joaquin exclaimed with sudden energy:&#xD;
"I will spare you., Your. countrymen&#xD;
have injured me; they have made me&#xD;
what I am, but I scorn to take the ad-&#xD;
vantage of so brave a man. I will risk&#xD;
a look and voice like yours, if it should&#xD;
ead to perdition. Saddle their horses&#xD;
or them, " he said to his followers, "and&#xD;
et them depart in peace."&#xD;
&#xD;
-The party were very soon mounted&#xD;
again, and showering blessings on Joa-&#xD;
quiu, who had become suddenly trans-&#xD;
formed into an angel in their estimation,&#xD;
they took their leave. I have never&#xD;
learned that the young man, or any of&#xD;
his party, broke their singular compact,&#xD;
and indeed it seems to me that it would-&#xD;
have been very questionable morality in&#xD;
them to have done so, for certainly, how-&#xD;
ever much they owed to society, it would&#xD;
have been a suicidal act to refuse to&#xD;
enter into such an agreement, and as&#xD;
nothing but a firm conviction that they&#xD;
intended to keep their word, could have&#xD;
induced Joaquin to run so great a risk,&#xD;
they were bound to preserve their faith&#xD;
inviolate. If they had a right to pur-&#xD;
chase their lives at the price of silence,&#xD;
they had an equal right, and not only&#xD;
that, but were morally bound to stand&#xD;
up to their bargain. It would be well&#xD;
if men were never forced into such a&#xD;
position, but society has no right, after&#xD;
it has happened, to wring from them a&#xD;
secret which belongs to Cm, and not to.&#xD;
the world, In such matters God is the*&#xD;
only judge.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
ARRIVALS FROM soNORA - THE MYS-&#xD;
TERIOUs DEATH OF GUERnA-o1ER-&#xD;
ATIONS IN CALAVERAS COUNTY -&#xD;
HAm-BBEADTH ESCAPE OF JOAQUIN.&#xD;
The month of December was drawing&#xD;
to a close, and the busy brain of the ac-&#xD;
complished chief had mapped -outthe&#xD;
full plan of his operations for a new&#xD;
year just at hand. It was the year&#xD;
which would close his short and tragical&#xD;
career with a crowning glory,-a deedof&#xD;
daring and of power, which woeld re-&#xD;
deem with its refulgent light the dark-&#xD;
ness of his previous history, and show&#xD;
him to after times not as a mere outlaw,&#xD;
&#xD;
committing petty depredations aud rob-&#xD;
beries, but as a hero who has revenged&#xD;
his country's wrongs, and washed out&#xD;
her disgrace in the blood of her enemies.&#xD;
It was time for Three-Fingered Jack&#xD;
and Valenzuela to return from Sonora,&#xD;
and'he waited patiently for their arrival,&#xD;
in order to replenish his purse largely&#xD;
during the first months of the new year,&#xD;
so that he might execute his magnificent&#xD;
purpose without embarrassment or ob-&#xD;
struction. In a few days Garcia and Val-&#xD;
enzuela returned, accompanied byan old&#xD;
guerrilla comrade of the latter, named&#xD;
Luis Vulvia. The two had lost five&#xD;
men from their bands, killed in several&#xD;
skirmishes, on their way back, with the&#xD;
citizens of Los Angeles county. Further&#xD;
than this they had received nqinjury, and&#xD;
were in fine health and spirits, although&#xD;
their horses were somewhat jaded. Each&#xD;
leader handed to Joaquin a well-filled&#xD;
purse of gold coin. Having rested two&#xD;
days, the major portion of the banditti&#xD;
mounted fresh horses, and leaving the&#xD;
remainder, numbering twenty-five men,&#xD;
at the rendezvous, under the command&#xD;
of Guerra, with whopi- they also left&#xD;
the females, not thinking it prudent, in&#xD;
view of the bloody scenes -which would&#xD;
be enactedto take them along, they set&#xD;
out for Calaveras county.&#xD;
They had not been gone more than&#xD;
three daysbefore a quarrel arose between&#xD;
Guerra and his affectionate wife; which&#xD;
ended in his giving, her a wholesome&#xD;
thrashing. Shesubmittedtotheinfliction&#xD;
with great apparent humility, but the&#xD;
next morning at breakfast time, when&#xD;
Guerra was called and did not come,&#xD;
several of his companies went in-&#xD;
to his tent to arouse him and found him&#xD;
stone dead. There was no sign of vio-&#xD;
lence on his body, an d it remained a&#xD;
complete mystery how he died.: He had&#xD;
been a hard drinker, and finally his&#xD;
death was attributed to an over-indul-&#xD;
gence the night before. But the fact of&#xD;
the case was, that the unconscious sleeper&#xD;
had received at midnight just one drop&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7584-00000025"/>&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
of molten lead into his ear, tipped from,&#xD;
a ladle by' a small and skillful hand.&#xD;
Byron hassaid in oneof his misanthropic'&#xD;
verses:&#xD;
Woman's tears produced at will,.&#xD;
Deceive in life, unman in death,"&#xD;
and the truth of this bitter asseveration&#xD;
was partially illustrated when the incon-&#xD;
solable widow wept so long and well&#xD;
over, the husband, whom she like a&#xD;
second, nay the thousandth Jezebel, had&#xD;
made a- corpse.  It is barely possible,&#xD;
however, that her tears were those' of re-&#xD;
morse. .She accepted for her third hus-&#xD;
band a young fellow in the band at the&#xD;
rendezvous, named Isidora Conejo, who&#xD;
loved her much more tenderly than did&#xD;
the brutal Guerra, whom she so skillfujy&#xD;
put out of the way. This young man&#xD;
was afew yearsherjunior, but she looked&#xD;
as youthful ashimself. Twice widowed,&#xD;
her sorrows had not dimmed the lustre&#xD;
of her eyes, or taken the gloss from her&#xD;
rich daik hair, or the rose from her&#xD;
cheeks. Her step was as buoyant as ever,&#xD;
the play of her limbs as graceful, the%&#xD;
heave of her impulsive bosom as entran,.&#xD;
cing and her voice as full of music, as if&#xD;
she had never lost Gonzalez or mur-&#xD;
dered Guerra. There are some women&#xD;
who seem never to grow old. As each   t&#xD;
successive spring renews the plumage  c&#xD;
of the birds, so'with them the passing&#xD;
years add fresh beauty to their forms, t&#xD;
and decay long lingers ere he has the  f&#xD;
heart to touch their transcendent loveli-  o&#xD;
ness with his cold and withering fingers. o&#xD;
The fascinating Margarita was one of v&#xD;
these.   .d&#xD;
Joaquin with his party, fully bent on  a&#xD;
the most extensive mischief, reentered  'g&#xD;
Calaveras county about the middle of  a&#xD;
December. This county was then, as it t'&#xD;
is now, one of the richest in the State of  a&#xD;
California. its inounntains 'weie veined  a&#xD;
with gold-the beds of its clear and far- s&#xD;
rushing streams' concealed the yellow  Im&#xD;
grains in abundance-and the large it&#xD;
quartz leads, like the golden tree of the  F&#xD;
Hesperides, spread their fruitful'branches ti&#xD;
&#xD;
abroad through the hills. Its 'fertile&#xD;
valleys bloomed with- Voluptuous .ffow-&#xD;
ers, over whieh you mightwalk as on a,&#xD;
carpet woven of iainbows-e-:--r waved&#xD;
with the green and yellow harvests,&#xD;
whose reedy music charmed' the ear.&#xD;
The busy whels of the sawmills, with&#xD;
their glittering teeth, 'rived the mighty&#xD;
pines which stood like green and spiral&#xD;
towers, one above another, from base- to&#xD;
summit of the majestic peaks. Long&#xD;
tunnels, dimly lighted with swinging&#xD;
lamps or flickering candies, searched far&#xD;
into the bowels of the earth for her hid-&#xD;
den secrets. -Those which were aban-&#xD;
doned served as dens for the cougar and&#xD;
wolf, or, more frequently as the dens of&#xD;
thieves.       -I&#xD;
- Over this attractive field of his enter-&#xD;
prises, Joaquin scattered his party in&#xD;
different directions. 'He entrusted Rels&#xD;
with thecommand of twenty men; Luis&#xD;
Vulvia with that of twenty-five, retain.&#xD;
Ing about fifteen for his o'wn use,'among&#xD;
whomn was the terrible Three-ingered&#xD;
Jack, and the no less' valuable Valenzu-&#xD;
ela, and employed the remaindeas spies&#xD;
and bearers of news from, one point of&#xD;
action to another. Reis went up to the&#xD;
headwaters of the Stanislaus'River, be.&#xD;
tween whose forks the rich valleys, cov.&#xD;
ered with horses, afforded a fine theatre&#xD;
for his operations. On all the moun-&#xD;
ain-fed branches and 'springs of these&#xD;
orks, the picks and shovels of thousands.&#xD;
)f miners were busy, and the industri-&#xD;
us Chinese had pitched their littleloth&#xD;
illages in a ,hundred spots, and each&#xD;
lay hurried to and fro like innumerable,&#xD;
ints, picking upthe small but precious,&#xD;
rains. ' Luis Vulvia-as daring a man&#xD;
s'Claudio, and'as cunning-proceeded to&#xD;
he headwatersIof the Mokelftine River;&#xD;
nd detached portions of these twro bands,&#xD;
t intervals 'ranged the intermediate&#xD;
pace. Joaqiin himself had no particu.&#xD;
ar sphere, but chose his ground, accord.&#xD;
ig to circumstances. Keeping Three-&#xD;
'ingered Jack with' him" most of the.&#xD;
!me, he fet once in ia while gavre him-&#xD;
&#xD;
the charge of small party, with liberty&#xD;
to do as::'he pleased-.-a favor which thed&#xD;
bloody monster made good use of, sof&#xD;
much so that scarcely a man whom hei t&#xD;
ever met, rich or poor, escaped with hisf&#xD;
life. The horse which this, hideous fel- '&#xD;
low rode might have rivalled ." Buceph-&#xD;
alus" in breadth of chest, high spirit and&#xD;
strength oflimb, united. with swiftness.&#xD;
No one but a powerful man could have&#xD;
rode him; but Three-Fingered Jack,&#xD;
with a fine Mexican -saddle, (the best&#xD;
saddle in the world) fastened securely&#xD;
with a broad girth made of horse hair,I&#xD;
as strong as a band of iron, and curbing&#xD;
him with'a huge Spanish bit, with which'&#xD;
he might have, rent his jaw, managed&#xD;
the royal animal with ease. To see this&#xD;
man, with his large and rugged frame,&#xD;
in which the strength of a dozen com-&#xD;
mon men slumbered, his face and fore-&#xD;
head scarred with bullets and grooved&#xD;
with the wrinkles of grim thoughts, and&#xD;
his intensely lighted eyes glaring malici-&#xD;
ously, like caverned demons, under his&#xD;
shaggy brows; to see such a man mount.&#xD;
ed upon a raven-black horse, whose nos-&#xD;
trils.drew the air like a gust of wind into&#xD;
his broad chest, whose wrathful hoof&#xD;
pawed the ground as if'the spirit of his&#xD;
rider inspired him, and whose wild orbs&#xD;
rolled, from side to side in untameable&#xD;
fire; would aptly remind one of old Saan&#xD;
himself, mounted upon a hell-born beast,&#xD;
after he had been "let loose for a thous-&#xD;
and years."&#xD;
'Among the many thrilling instances&#xD;
of the-daring and recklessness of spirit&#xD;
which belonged to Joaquin, there is one&#xD;
which I do not feel at liberty to omit,&#xD;
especially as it comes naturally and&#xD;
properly in this connection. Shortly&#xD;
after he parted  from  Reis and Luis&#xD;
Vulvia, he went up into the extreme&#xD;
north of the county. There, at the head&#xD;
of a. branch of the South ,Fork of the&#xD;
Mokelumne River, in a wild and deso-&#xD;
late region near the boundary line 'of&#xD;
Calaveras and El Dorado counties, werd&#xD;
located a company of. miners, consisting&#xD;
&#xD;
of twenty-five men. They were a lopg&#xD;
distance from  any neighbors, having&#xD;
gone there well armed on a prospecting&#xD;
tour, which resulted in their findiAg dig-&#xD;
gings so rich that they were' persuaded&#xD;
to pitch their tents and remain. One-&#xD;
morning while they were eating their&#xD;
breakfast on a fiat rock-a natural table&#xD;
which stood in front of their tents-&#xD;
armed as usual with their revolvers, a-&#xD;
young fellow with very dark hair and.&#xD;
eyes, rode up and saluted them. ,He-&#xD;
spoke very good English, and they could&#xD;
scarcely make out whether he was a&#xD;
Mexican or an American. They requested&#xD;
him to get down and eat with them&#xD;
but he politely declined. lHe sat with&#xD;
one leg crossed over his horse's neck&#xD;
very much at his ease, conversing freely&#xD;
on various subjects, until JimBoyce, one&#xD;
of the partners, who had been to the-&#xD;
spring after water, ,appeared in sight.&#xD;
At the first glance of him the yoIng&#xD;
horseman flung his reclining leg back&#xD;
over the saddle, and spurred his horse..&#xD;
Boyce roared out:&#xD;
" Boys, that felloW is Joaquin I --n&#xD;
it, shoot him!" At the same instant he-&#xD;
himself fired, but without effect.&#xD;
Joaquin dashed down to the creek be-&#xD;
low with headlong speed, and crossed&#xD;
with the intention, no- doubt, to escape-&#xD;
over the hills, which ran parallel with.&#xD;
the stream, but his way was blocked up,&#xD;
by perpendicular rocks, and his only&#xD;
practicable path was a narrow digger-&#xD;
trail, which led along the side of a huge&#xD;
mountain, directly over a ledge of rocks&#xD;
a hundred yards in length, which hpng&#xD;
beetling over the rushing stream be-&#xD;
neath, in a-direct line with the hill upon&#xD;
-which the miners had pitched their&#xD;
tents, and not more than forty yardsdis-&#xD;
tant. It was a fearful gauntlet for any&#xD;
man to run. Not only was there dan-&#xD;
ger of falling a hundred feet from the&#xD;
rocks, but he must run in a parllel line&#xD;
with his enemies, and in pistol range for-&#xD;
a hundred yards. In fair view of him&#xD;
stood the whole company with their-&#xD;

Shot after shot came clanging around m&#xD;
his head, and bullet afterbullet flattened  the&#xD;
on the wall of slate at his right. In the  caP&#xD;
midst of the first firing his hat was  tw&#xD;
knocked from his head, and left his long  mil&#xD;
black hair streaming behind him.  He  ma&#xD;
had no time to use his own pistol, but mi&#xD;
knowing that his only chance lay in the  wb&#xD;
swiftness of his sure-footed animal, he  the&#xD;
drew his keenly polished bowie knife in led&#xD;
proud delance of the danger, and waved  the&#xD;
it in scorn as he rode on.  It was per- ma&#xD;
fectly sublime to see such superhuman  nig&#xD;
daring and recklessness. At each report, lia&#xD;
which came fast and thick, he kissed the  out&#xD;
fishing blade and waved it at his foes. pu&#xD;
He passed the ordeal, as awful and har- tez&#xD;
rowing to a man's nerves as can be con- tra&#xD;

Joaquin, knowing well the determined&#xD;
aracter of Jim Boyce, and deeming it&#xD;
)re than probable that he had hoard of&#xD;
differentlarge rewards offered for his&#xD;
pture, or death, amounting to fifteen or&#xD;
enty thousanddollars, he madeup his&#xD;
nd speedily, that an attack would be&#xD;
de upon hirai by the whole party of&#xD;
[ners,if he remained at his encampment,&#xD;
ich was some five miles distant from&#xD;
eirown. Concludingtheycouldnot col-&#xD;
t their horses together and prepare&#xD;
eir arms and ammunition in a proper&#xD;
nner for an attack or pursuit, before,&#xD;
ght, he conceived a plan, the most bril-&#xD;
nt and ingenious that ever entered an&#xD;
tlaw's brain, by which to defeat their&#xD;
poses andcarry out his own originalip-&#xD;
tion of robbing them. Knowing that a&#xD;
il could very well be made In the night&#xD;
I that it could only be followed in the--&#xD;
ytime; he ordered his Inen, number-&#xD;
g fifteen, to saddle up and make ready&#xD;
a ride.  They obeyed with alacrity,&#xD;
d without question, andin a few min-&#xD;
es were on their horses and ready to&#xD;
ive forward.  The chief led the way&#xD;
silence, proceeding over the pine&#xD;
ges in an easterly direction. He rode&#xD;
vigorously until night,, over very,&#xD;
ugh ground, having traversed a dis-&#xD;
ace of twenty miles; but wishing to&#xD;
ce a still greater distance between&#xD;
m and the encampment which he had&#xD;
t, he did not come to final halt until a&#xD;
e hour. Building a, huge fire, and&#xD;
ching their animals near by, the wea-&#xD;
d bandits hastily threw their blankets-&#xD;
wn and stretched their limbs upon&#xD;
em for repose. Sentinels alternately&#xD;
up until daylight, so that at the first&#xD;
uch of dawn the whole band arose and&#xD;
aIn started, havinglost only four hours&#xD;
sleep.  They journeyed on in the&#xD;
me course, as briskly as possible until&#xD;

moon, when, having reached a nice little&#xD;
valley, covered-with grass and wild clo-&#xD;
ver, and watered by a beautiful spring&#xD;
which bubbled up from the roots of a&#xD;
-clump of evergreen oaks, distant about'&#xD;
twenty miles from their last encamp-&#xD;
ment, they stopped for two hours to let&#xD;
their horses graze, and to refresh their&#xD;
own rather empty stomachs with the'&#xD;
sardines and . crackers which they&#xD;
.generally carried with them. Here they&#xD;
left strong indications that they had&#xD;
spent the night, but established the con-&#xD;
trary fact by riding on for the remainder&#xD;
-of the day, whose close found them at&#xD;
.anotherdistanceoftwenty miles. Build-&#xD;
ingfiresas before, and eating a hasty sujp--&#xD;
per they again mounted, and having&#xD;
made a circle of five miles in their course,&#xD;
-suddenly turned to the westward, and&#xD;
encamped about three o'clock in the&#xD;
morning at a spot, distant another com-&#xD;
mon day's journey from the last starting&#xD;
point. Thus traveling and resting, after&#xD;
the lapse of afew days they found them-&#xD;
selves in the original trail upon which&#xD;
they started.&#xD;
Jim  Boyce and company had struck&#xD;
the path of the robbers on the next&#xD;
morning after their departure, and had&#xD;
encamped'each night at the fires which&#xD;
they-had left, expecting, as was natural,&#xD;
thAt they would core to a final stopping&#xD;
place when they had proceeded as far as&#xD;
they liked. Joaguin smiled with exquis:&#xD;
ite satisfaction when he perceived that&#xD;
Boyee was certainly ahead of him, and&#xD;
from every -indication unsuspecting in&#xD;
the remotest degree, that his arch enemy&#xD;
was at that moment in his rear.&#xD;
At night, after a long day's ride over&#xD;
rugged mountains and deep gulches, Jim&#xD;
Boyce and his company, numbering twen.&#xD;
ty-five men, including himself, were&#xD;
seated around one of Joaquin's late fires,&#xD;
which they had re-kindled, quietly en.&#xD;
joying their pipes and laughing over the&#xD;
stereotyped jokes which had descended,&#xD;
like Shakspeare, from one generation to&#xD;
another, and are too good ever to be&#xD;
&#xD;
worn out. The heavens -were cloudy,&#xD;
and a boundary of solid darkness lay&#xD;
around the lighted ring in whibh they&#xD;
gat. In the ragged clouds a few stars.&#xD;
dimly struggled, and the lonesome&#xD;
scream of the cougar, like the wail of a&#xD;
lost spirit benighted in the infinity of&#xD;
darkness, gave a wild terror to the sur-.&#xD;
rounding woods.&#xD;
Suddenly and startlingly, the simul-&#xD;
taneous reports of fifteen pistol rent the&#xD;
air, the dark outer wall of the fire circle&#xD;
blazed as if a cloud had unbosomed its&#xD;
lightning, and the astonished survivors&#xD;
of the company bounded up to-seefif-&#xD;
teen of their number stretched upon the&#xD;
earth, and to meet with the deadly repe-&#xD;
tition of the fifteen revolvers. Panic&#xD;
stricken and bewildered, the survivors&#xD;
of the second discharge, numbering three&#xD;
men, anong whom was Jim Boyce, fled&#xD;
headlong into the darkness, and taking&#xD;
no time to choose their ground, hurried&#xD;
madly and distractedly away from the&#xD;
horrible scene. Joaquin stepped quietly&#xD;
into the circle to see.if Jim Boyce was&#xD;
killed, but Three-Fingered Jack leaped&#xD;
in like a demon, with his huge knife in&#xD;
his mutilated hand, which had lost none&#xD;
of its strength, but did its three-fingered&#xD;
work far better than iany other whole&#xD;
hands could do it, and soon- quenched&#xD;
the last spark'of beating life in the pale&#xD;
forms around him. . Every one must&#xD;
know that death from a bullet flings a&#xD;
sudden and extreme paleness over the&#xD;
countenance, and thus the light from&#xD;
the fire falling upon the ghastly faces&#xD;
around, displayed a sight so hideous and&#xD;
harrowing, that Joaquin exclaimed, with&#xD;
a shudder:&#xD;
' Lot's leave here. We will camp to-&#xD;
night somewhere else."&#xD;
Searching the bundles upon which the&#xD;
company had been seated, he found in&#xD;
different buckskin purses a sumramount-&#xD;
ing to not less than thirty thousand dol-&#xD;
lars. He also added fifteen exceUent&#xD;
horses and ten powerful mules to his live&#xD;
stock.&#xD;
&#xD;

Jim Boyce and his surviving compan-&#xD;
ions wandered to the distant settlements,&#xD;
which,' after, many  har4s'hips, they&#xD;
reached in safety, and it is pleasant to&#xD;
add, that in a short time they raised an.&#xD;
other company with whom they went&#xD;
back to their rich diggings, and spite of.&#xD;
their immense loss by Joaquin's rob-&#xD;
bery, made for themselves ample for-&#xD;
tunes, with which they returned to the&#xD;
'Atlantic, States.  Should Jim  Boyce&#xD;
chance to read-this humble narrative of&#xD;
mine, I beg him to receive my warmest&#xD;
congratulations.,&#xD;
On one of the head branches of the&#xD;
Mokelumne Rnver, on the last day of&#xD;
December, a large crowd was gathered&#xD;
in and arounda cloth building, in a little&#xD;
mining town, which looked like a half&#xD;
venture towards civilization in the midst&#xD;
of that wild and savage region. A tall,&#xD;
dark-skinned man sat in the middle of&#xD;
the room, with a huge log chain around&#xD;
one of his legs. His brow was tall and&#xD;
massive, and his large gray eyes looked&#xD;
forth with that calm, cold light which&#xD;
unmistakably expresses a deep, calcula-&#xD;
ting intellect, divested of all feeling, and&#xD;
independent of all motives which arise'&#xD;
from mere impulse or passion-an intel-&#xD;
lect which is sole in itself, looking at&#xD;
the result merely in all its actions, not&#xD;
considering the question of right or&#xD;
wrong, and working out a scheme of un-&#xD;
mitigated villainy, as it would a math-&#xD;
ematical problem. To the right of this&#xD;
man sat a huge old fellow, with blue&#xD;
eyes, sandy hair, and a severe look, whose&#xD;
scattered law books and papers on the-&#xD;
table near by, proclaimed himtheJustice&#xD;
of the Peace in that district-an office, by&#xD;
the way,asimportant at that time in Cali-&#xD;
fornia, and possessing a jurisdiction as&#xD;
extensive as many of the County Courts&#xD;
in other and older States of the Union..&#xD;
The prisioner was none other than&#xD;
Luis Vulvia, who had been arrested on&#xD;
a charge of murder and robbery in that&#xD;
town on the day before, under the fol-&#xD;
lowing circumstances:&#xD;
&#xD;
AGerman, living by himself in a1w iso-&#xD;
lated tent, was heard to scream " mur-&#xD;
der"-three times; hearing which horr-&#xD;
ble cry, fiv6 or ix men -some two hun-&#xD;
dred yards olitran upto the place, and at a&#xD;
glance comprehended the whole scene.&#xD;
The German lay'withhis throat cut from&#xD;
ear to ear, and his pockets turned inside-&#xD;
out.   Lookipg hastily around on the-&#xD;
outside, tbey  discovered  two  men,.&#xD;
apparently Mexicans, who dodged on,&#xD;
the fuiher side of a deserted cabin.&#xD;
and disappeared. behind some,, rocks..&#xD;
Going to the rocks and finding no fur-.&#xD;
ther trace of the fugitives, they went&#xD;
back and alarmed the whole town with.&#xD;
a statement of the circumstances. Elery&#xD;
eye was vigilant tin every quarter, andn&#xD;
just as Luis Vulvia, who had observed,&#xD;
the fast increasing excitement, and.&#xD;
guessed pretty nearly the character of&#xD;
its cause, was mounting his horse in.&#xD;
front of a liquor saloon, he was suddenly&#xD;
knocked down with a bludgeon, disarmed.&#xD;
and securely bound.   The people -&#xD;
massa securely guarded him during the&#xD;
night which was just at hand, intending&#xD;
to hanghim without a trial on the mor-&#xD;
row, but were dissuaded-by Justice&#xD;
Brown, the tall, severe looking man spo-&#xD;
ken of, who being a man of influence,&#xD;
and a good speaker withal, convinced&#xD;
them that it was betterto proceed with&#xD;
him legally, as there was but little;&#xD;
doubt of his being found guilty as one&#xD;
of the murderers,.in which casehe would&#xD;
deliver him over to theirjust vengeance.&#xD;
Thus the case stood, up to the moment&#xD;
in which the subject is introduced,&#xD;
,The witnesses, who ranat the cry of&#xD;
murder to the tent, and saw the two.&#xD;
Mexicans dodging around the house,&#xD;
could swear no further than that oneof&#xD;
them was of about, the 'same size and.&#xD;
shape'as the prisoner. -The barkeeper of&#xD;
the liquor saloon testified' in addition to&#xD;
this, that the prisoner rode up to his,&#xD;
door and dismounted just before his ar-&#xD;
rest. It was well known also, that a&#xD;
dozen or more robberies had lately been&#xD;

JAJQOi TAI        A&#xD;
committed in that :neighborhood, and&#xD;
that various personshad met upon the&#xD;
roads a gang of suspicious looking Mexi-&#xD;
cans armed to the teeth. This constitu-&#xD;
ted all the testimony against Vulvia,,&#xD;
whose person-was unknown to the com-&#xD;
munity, but whose name was familiar to&#xD;
all by reputation. Had he been. recog-&#xD;
nizeg4 as that noted character, no further&#xD;
inquiry would have been made, but he&#xD;
would have, been hurried to the -first&#xD;
convenient tree and hung instanter.&#xD;
He stoodon a dangerous brink. Being&#xD;
asked by-the Justice if he had any proof&#xD;
to offer in his own behalf,.he replied that&#xD;
hedepended upon sone of his acquaint-&#xD;
ances coming in during the day, who&#xD;
would establish his character as an honest&#xD;
man to the satisfaction of the Court.&#xD;
He affirmed his innocence in a calm tone,&#xD;
and an unflinching manner, although,&#xD;
could-his heart have been read, he relied&#xD;
upon the possibility of a rescue by his&#xD;
comrades,. which was indeed a feeble&#xD;
hope, looking at the immense crowd who&#xD;
stood scowling upon him from every&#xD;
side. -A silence of half an hour rested in&#xD;
the Court, while the Justice was en-&#xD;
gagedin drawing up a transcript of the-&#xD;
case as far as it had proceeded, when a&#xD;
yeongman superbly dressed, and adorned&#xD;
with a splendid gold watch and chain,&#xD;
entered the room with gentlemanly dig.&#xD;
nity,'and politely addressed the Justice&#xD;
to the following effect:&#xD;
I"My name, your Honor, is Samuel&#xD;
Harrington. I am a merchant and&#xD;
packer in the town of San Jose, and I&#xD;
am just now on my return from the more&#xD;
northern mines, to 'which I have been&#xD;
packing flour and other provisions. I,&#xD;
am encamped within five miles of this&#xD;
place, and having heard from a citizen&#xD;
of your town this morning, that a dark-&#xD;
skinned man, with grey eyes, was in cus-&#xD;
tody on a charge of murder, and that al-&#xD;
though there was no positive proof&#xD;
against him, yet there was so strong a&#xD;
prejudice against Mexicans, that there&#xD;
was great danger of -his being hung by&#xD;
&#xD;
theinfuriated poplacpit just struckme&#xD;
that the prisoner ,ggh  , eqpe6f my,&#xD;
hired men, a Mexican whom j sen4 5rto&#xD;
town last, night, and:who, much -tmy&#xD;
astonishment,- did not return. It is in&#xD;
deed the case. Your prisoner is none&#xD;
other than my.packer,.and, consequently&#xD;
cannot be connected with any robbing or&#xD;
thieving band around here He has&#xD;
been with me four years, and no man&#xD;
ever sustained a ,better character. .&#xD;
shall wish, your Honor, to testify in his&#xD;
behalf, but before I take my oath I&#xD;
would like to prove my identity as Mr.&#xD;
Harrington of San Jose. Please exam-&#xD;
ine these letters."&#xD;
He here presented to the, Justice, who&#xD;
was already favorably impressed, five or&#xD;
six letters, addressed in different hands,&#xD;
to "Mr. Samuel Harrington, San Josd,"&#xD;
and bearing jhe marks of various Post&#xD;
Offices inthe State. The Justice showed&#xD;
these letters to several of the crowd,&#xD;
whose countenancesimmediately relaxed&#xD;
towards the prisoner.&#xD;
"Mr. Harrington,".said Pquire Brown,&#xD;
"your evidence will, be taken without a&#xD;
moment's scruple."&#xD;
Harrington accordingly .testified to&#xD;
the facts which he had already related,&#xD;
and the prisoner was discharged. ~Many&#xD;
apologies were made to Mr. Harrington&#xD;
for detaining his hired man so long, and&#xD;
after many compliments he aild Vulvia&#xD;
departed. As'soon as they were clearly&#xD;
out of town, they both indulged in a&#xD;
hearty laughs&#xD;
"How came it," said Vulvia to Joa-&#xD;
quin, "that, you arrived in such good&#xD;
time? I had no expectation but to be&#xD;
hung.&#xD;
"I happened to reach your camp oit&#xD;
here in the mountains lastnight, having&#xD;
met some of our spies who guided me to&#xD;
it. I had not been there more than two&#xD;
hours before two of your men came in,&#xD;
and reported that they had killed a man&#xD;
in that zittodota totwn and inquired for&#xD;
you. Your being absent immediately&#xD;
created apprehension, and having wait-&#xD;

5                        ,JOAQUMlN&#xD;
ed for you anxiously till morning, we&#xD;
were at once convinced that ou' had'&#xD;
been captured. Having most fortunate-&#xD;
ly in my possession a package of letters&#xD;
addressed to Samuel Harringtoni San&#xD;
Jos4, which I had the good sense to&#xD;
keep, thank God! to preserve at the,&#xD;
time't got them into my hands,-it imme-&#xD;
diately flashed on me that in case I&#xD;
found you arrested, I could pass myself&#xD;
off for a respectable merchant, and so&#xD;
save your life. It worked to a charm, as&#xD;
you see. I make it a practice to preserve&#xD;
documents of this kind, and I find that&#xD;
they come in pretty good play."&#xD;
"But how did you come by them?"&#xD;
inquired Vulvia.&#xD;
"Oh, easy enough. I killed a fellow&#xD;
O  may way down here the other day,&#xD;
and found them inhispockets ; and d--d&#xD;
little besides, too."   .&#xD;
"You remind me," said Vulvia, "very'&#xD;
much of Padre Jurata, God rest his soul!&#xD;
He saved many of his followers by being&#xD;
present at their trials, or introducing&#xD;
winesses topieve an aWi, orpresenting&#xD;
foged pardons on the day of execution,&#xD;
signed in the exact hands of the Provin-&#xD;
cial avrnors. His knowledge was ex-&#xD;
tensive, and during his' monkish life&#xD;
the confessional had given him so many&#xD;
important and vital secrets connected&#xD;
with great personages, that he could fre-&#xD;
quently command the services of the&#xD;
wealthiest men and the bes) born dames&#xD;
of Mexico. Besides this, he sometimes'&#xD;
officiated as one of the Fathers in the re-&#xD;
mote towns and villages."&#xD;
Thus conversing, they rode on to Vul-&#xD;
via's camp, some ten miles in the moun-&#xD;
tains, and were met by a welcome shout&#xD;
from their subordinates.&#xD;
While at this camp, resting his horses,&#xD;
a messpnger arrived from Reis on the&#xD;
Stanislaus, with the news that hehad&#xD;
killed one hundred and fifty Chinamen,&#xD;
and had sent-to the Arroyo Cantoova two&#xD;
hundred horses since he- had last seen&#xD;
his chief.&#xD;
&#xD;
fURIETA.&#xD;
"Tell him," said Joaquin, "it is all&#xD;
right, and to go ahead; I-will send him.&#xD;
word before long. Tell 1him hereafter&#xD;
to send his horses for safe keeping to&#xD;
Quien Babe Rancho, Rancho Mulos, or&#xD;
Joaquin Guerra's Rancho, either of the&#xD;
three."&#xD;
Reis had managed most cnungly.&#xD;
Hid in an old abandoned tunnel, out of,&#xD;
which he had whipped a gang of wolves,&#xD;
he nor any of his party had beeAn seen&#xD;
by daylight at all.  All his thefts and&#xD;
robberies had been: done in thenight.&#xD;
The miserable OChinamen were.-mostly&#xD;
the sufferers, and they lay along the&#xD;
highways like so many sheep with their&#xD;
throats cut by.the wolves. It wasa pol-&#xD;
itic stroke in Reis to kill Chinamen in&#xD;
preference to Americans, for no one cated&#xD;
for so alien a class, and they were left to&#xD;
care for-themselves.&#xD;
One moonlight night at the houz of&#xD;
twelve, when silence had fallen upon the&#xD;
world of mountains, woods and valleys,&#xD;
and all quiet spirits were asleep, Reis&#xD;
issued from his tunnel, three hundred-&#xD;
feet under ground, with three men, and-&#xD;
getting out their horses from the corral&#xD;
of a friendly rancho near by=-who was&#xD;
kind enough to take care of them, no&#xD;
doubt from disinterested motives-they&#xD;
started on a pleasure trip up a rather&#xD;
lonesome road, which led along a branch&#xD;
of the SouthForkof the Stanislaus River.&#xD;
Coming in sight of a neat looking frame&#xD;
house, Reis, bent upon an adventure,&#xD;
dismounted, as did also his followers,&#xD;
and hitching their horses on the roadside&#xD;
walked stealthily up to the house. At&#xD;
the first there appeared to be a dead&#xD;
silence, about the premises, but going&#xD;
around on the east side, Reis discovered&#xD;
a light burning at a window, and draw-.&#xD;
ing nearer heard the murmuring, of&#xD;
voices. Not caring particularly what he&#xD;
did, curiosity led him to look in; which&#xD;
object he readily effected,'being. a tell&#xD;
man. The sight that met his view was,&#xD;
something no less-ravishing than a love&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
scene. Upon a settee onthe further side&#xD;
of the room, half-reclining, sat .a blsh-&#xD;
ing girl of seventeen years, her golden&#xD;
ringlets showered down upon her neck&#xD;
and shoulders, and her bosom heaving&#xD;
as if it would burst its gauzy covering&#xD;
and strike the gazer blind with its un-&#xD;
speakable loveliness. At her feet, upon&#xD;
the carpeted floor, knelt a handsome&#xD;
young man, not more than twenty years&#xD;
of age, holding her small white hand in&#xD;
his, which ever and anon he hurried to&#xD;
his lips, and seemed to devour it with&#xD;
kisses. Shb could not restrain his wild&#xD;
transports, for he caught her with a&#xD;
lover's fierceness around her beautiful&#xD;
neck, and' breathed his soul upon her&#xD;
lips. He sprang to her side and pressed&#xD;
her to his bosom as if he would blend&#xD;
his very body with her own. She looked&#xD;
bewildered, the beautiful creature!I one&#xD;
moment gently striving to wrest herself&#xD;
from his arms, at another leaning her&#xD;
head upon his bosom with a sigh of un-&#xD;
utterable love. It was a light which&#xD;
might well disturb the equanimity of&#xD;
any man, and it is not to be wondered at&#xD;
that Reis looked on like one bewitched.&#xD;
Fate at last had some mercy on the ban-&#xD;
dit for after he had swallowed his up-&#xD;
rising heart a hundred'times with look-,&#xD;
ing on the.enchanted beauty of the pas-&#xD;
sionate. girl in her lover's arms, the&#xD;
latter tore himself away and started forth&#xD;
from the house. One of the bandits fol-&#xD;
lowed him as a matter of course, while&#xD;
Reis hastily concerted with the others&#xD;
how to act-for he was determined to&#xD;
abduct the girl at all hazards.&#xD;
. The young man was walking very&#xD;
leisurely along In a bend of the road,&#xD;
when he heard a sharp click just behind&#xD;
him. With sudden su-prise he looked&#xD;
around, and there, face to face with him&#xD;
stood a man, or devil, or whatever else&#xD;
it night be, with a cocked pistolpoited&#xD;
within six inches of his head.&#xD;
"DoWn on your knees, or I will blow&#xD;
your brains out."&#xD;
&#xD;
The young man knelt now    from a&#xD;
different motive to that which made-&#xD;
him kneel a short time before.&#xD;
"Shell out you dastardly scondrell"&#xD;
said the accomplished highwayman.&#xD;
" There, take it," and threw his pr;se&#xD;
a few feet from hih on the ground.&#xD;
,The robber stooped to pick it up, and&#xD;
while he was bent the young man drew&#xD;
a small dagger from his -bootleg and&#xD;
plunge it into his back. It struck him&#xD;
directly in the spine, .,and the huge-&#xD;
bodied villain sunk without a groan.&#xD;
The young man, vaguely suspecting&#xD;
that there might be dangerlurking near&#xD;
his Rosalie, went back to the house. To&#xD;
his horror, his ears were sAluted with a&#xD;
loud and piercing scream. Like a mad-&#xD;
man he rushed to the house, and had-&#xD;
just entered the door . of Rosalie's room.&#xD;
and taken one glance, Which showed&#xD;
him the terrified girl struggling in the&#xD;
hands of a savage-looking monster, when&#xD;
he was knocked senseless to the floor.&#xD;
The gray-haired old mother, a lonely&#xD;
widow, whole . only pleasure was her&#xD;
daughter, cl'ng to the robber's arm, and&#xD;
in the tremling accents of extreme old&#xD;
age, beseeched him-whilethe tears&#xD;
flooded the wrinkled channels of her&#xD;
face-to spare her child, her only child.&#xD;
"Cease your gabbling," said one of&#xD;
Reis' men, who knocked the old lady&#xD;
speechless at his feet.&#xD;
"Who told you to do that ?" said Reis,&#xD;
and instantly shot the officiouS scoun-&#xD;
drel through the heart.&#xD;
"Now my pretty duck you can come&#xD;
along with me," he said turning to his -&#xD;
captive.&#xD;
B'ut at the sight of the ruffian's blow,&#xD;
which felled her mother, Rosalie's blue&#xD;
eyes had closed in a swoon, and paleness&#xD;
as of death had overspread her features.&#xD;
" It makesmno diference," sad Ieisto&#xD;
his surviving companion, "she  1ll- soon&#xD;
get over it anyhow; let usIgo along."&#xD;
"I 4W't kn9w that I care outgoing&#xD;

as blabk as a thunder cloud, " after what&#xD;

laying his hand onhis stolat the same&#xD;

"You don't, eh ?' said Reis, "then&#xD;
you are as trifling a scoundrel as he is."&#xD;
The two fiied at once; the subordinate&#xD;
fell dead, and Reis was grazed on his&#xD;
right cheek with a piece of hot, lead,&#xD;
which made him blush, if his own vil-&#xD;
lainy did not.,&#xD;
" Blast the two-miserable scoundrels,"&#xD;
said he "it actually seems as if some&#xD;
men had no humanity at all."&#xD;
Tying the rounded wrists of his lovely&#xD;
drooping captive with his handkerchief,&#xD;
he proceeded to the spot where the'&#xD;
horses were hitched, cut them loose, all&#xD;
but his own, and mounted into his sad-&#xD;
dle with his precious booty before him.&#xD;
The loosened horses dashed back to the&#xD;
corral from which they had been taken,&#xD;
and Reis rode on by himself, till within&#xD;
a quarter of a mile of his tunnel, when&#xD;
he got down with his now weeping bur-&#xD;
den, turned his horse loose, which fol-&#xD;
lowed after the others, and proceeded on&#xD;
foot at his leisure.&#xD;
R6salie begged him to release her,&#xD;
with so mucli sorrowful sweetness in&#xD;
her voice, With so beautiful an agony&#xD;
expressivein her whole enchanting form,&#xD;
that the rocky-hearted Reis almos  're-&#xD;
pented.of what he had done.&#xD;
"It won't do," he thought, "to let her&#xD;
go no, for I will have nothing to show&#xD;
for my night's work, and how should I&#xD;
account to the band for the missing&#xD;
members?"&#xD;
"Ypu sha'nt be hurt," said he, turning&#xD;
mildly towards the trembling maiden,&#xD;
"I an going to keep you'ifya few days,&#xD;
until I canget a ransom ' for you, which&#xD;
soine of your friends will no doubt pay,&#xD;
Wion you send then wa ti byone of our&#xD;
nunibe-." "&#xD;
'Theyedn ±eanhedtheentraice of the&#xD;

dering giriaild led i halfded' with&#xD;
terror, into the extreme end, Where sat&#xD;
&#xD;
his fierce-looking companions in a well&#xD;
lighted apartment.&#xD;
The bandits, much interested, gathered&#xD;
around their captain, who infrmedtlrem&#xD;
-" that he had attacked a certain house&#xD;
on the road and succeeded in entering,&#xD;
but found no money, which disappointed&#xD;
him so much that he took this beautiful&#xD;
girl in the place of it ;'' and further sta-&#xD;
ted, "that in the struggle at the house,&#xD;
two of his men were killed before his&#xD;
face, and one was missing, he being pro-&#xD;
bably killed, as well as the others. As&#xD;
for this handsome girl," he concluded,&#xD;
" we may as well keep her for a ransom,&#xD;
or one of us may marry her, just as we,&#xD;
see fit."&#xD;
Poor, poor RosalieI may Heaven pro-&#xD;
tect you, for man cannot.&#xD;
Rosalie on the second night after her&#xD;
capture, resolved tohelp herself. Rising&#xD;
from a warm couch of blankets already&#xD;
dressed, and unperceived by the bandits,&#xD;
who lay slumbering around, she started&#xD;
into the throat of   the tunnel in&#xD;
order to find her way out. Pressing her,&#xD;
hand to her heart to still its.loud beat.&#xD;
ings, she stepped noiselesslylong, until&#xD;
she had left the sleeping apartment,&#xD;
'when looking forward, she saw that&#xD;
every light in front of her had been ex.&#xD;
tinguished. Pausing with indefinable&#xD;
dread at the-thought of walking that&#xD;
fearful passage alone, she heard a loud&#xD;
yawn from one of the sleepers, 'as if he&#xD;
were waking,.and with a sudden move-&#xD;
ment, which was scarce voluntary, she&#xD;
shot like an arrow into the blackness&#xD;
which lay before her. On and on, and&#xD;
on she moved with trembling footstep ,&#xD;
feeling her *ay on the sides of the tun-&#xD;
nel, and placing her feet each time with&#xD;
tihe idescribable terrible felingthat she&#xD;
might be stepping off Into some deep&#xD;
abyss below  It seemed ages to her, be.&#xD;
fore she could reach the entrance. Oh,&#xD;
that she might but catch one friendly&#xD;
glimpse of light I Itapeara a faint,&#xD;
flickering gleam in the 'distance. Wiih&#xD;
hurrying feet she approaches,-larger&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
andlarger it grows,- until shesees the&#xD;
lamp, like a full-blown rose of light&#xD;
-swinging from the arch;. joy I her escape&#xD;
.is ertain. She stands now in the fall&#xD;
!blaze, shjIe-sees no one, and with a more&#xD;
.confident heart pursues her way.. She&#xD;
was now near the entrance. She saw the&#xD;
moonlight flooding the world without,&#xD;
and rushed eagerly forward. A huge&#xD;
.fIgure started suddenly before her, and&#xD;
rthe beautiful girl fainted. It was h bad&#xD;
.titne to swoon, but how could so delicate&#xD;
.an organization, fit only to be played&#xD;
,upon by the subtlest flashes of thought,&#xD;
.sporting in rainbow-fancies, sustain so&#xD;
,rude a shock ? She fell gasping for&#xD;
breath, and the sentinel, for it was he,&#xD;
.carried her to the apartment which she&#xD;
had left, and tenderly laid her upon her&#xD;
.eguch, without disturbing any one in&#xD;
the room, and hurried back to his post.&#xD;
So tenderly delicate was this innocent&#xD;
-creature, so divine the appealing spirit&#xD;
of her eyes as he looked into her face, that&#xD;
eis could not find it in his heart to treat&#xD;
ber with anything but the profoundest re-&#xD;
spect. He had seized her in a moment&#xD;
'of passion, stung with her voluptuous&#xD;
-beauty, and would at that moment have&#xD;
-fought for her, as for a conquest of so&#xD;
anuch of Heaven itself. Such is the mad-&#xD;
,dening effect of beauty upon the hearts&#xD;
of menI But on sober reflection he ban-&#xD;
ished the vain idea, which he had -been&#xD;
foolish enough to vaguely entertain, that-&#xD;
.she could ever love a man like him, rude&#xD;
.and uncouth as he was, and seriously&#xD;
,contemplated restoring her to her aged&#xD;
and widowed mother, and one whom he&#xD;
knew that she loved. Confused and tor-,&#xD;
mented with 4oubt, she was a continual&#xD;
trouble on his hands. He was not scoun-&#xD;
drel enough to force her into a vile posi-&#xD;
tion, and he was afraid to leave her for&#xD;
a momipt in the hands of his less scru-&#xD;
pulous cgqrades. Already had they be-&#xD;
'gant"iVnragr athim for his weakness,&#xD;
and be ad-boon forced to threaten some&#xD;
of their lives, if they did not keep their&#xD;
stance from the girl. There was dan-&#xD;

ed Joaquin's,'ppinion of his' conduct in&#xD;
this specific matter, yet he longed to see'&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Reis was sitting one~night, moping in&#xD;
his tunnel like a grim wolf, and scowl-&#xD;
ing discontentedly, around him, for he&#xD;
had done nothing for a week, when, the&#xD;
sentinel came .in attended by two per-&#xD;
sons, whom he left standing before Reis,&#xD;
and returned tQ his post. The melan-&#xD;
choly bandit raised his head, aid beheld&#xD;
his now dreaded chief before him. Joa-&#xD;
quin glanced hastily around the room&#xD;
and beholding th6 captive girl reclining&#xD;
mournfully upon her couch, he started,&#xD;
and with a sudden fierceness, which&#xD;
made every man in his presence quail,&#xD;
turned to Reis, and said with 'a look that&#xD;
rived his soul:&#xD;
" How is this? Did I ever instruct&#xD;
you to engage in a business of this kind?&#xD;
Explain yourself, or by G-d, it will not&#xD;
be well for you."&#xD;
Reis begged him to listen patiently;&#xD;
and related every circumstance connected&#xD;
with the girl's capture, his killing his&#xD;
two comrades at the time, and everything&#xD;
which followed subsequently.&#xD;
Joaquin"was in a tempest of anger.&#xD;
"So you have done nothing but Mope&#xD;
for the past week,---essential service you&#xD;
have rendered to our organization. Reis,"&#xD;
he continued, convulsively clutching his&#xD;
pistol handle, "if it was any other man&#xD;
but you, I would kill him on the spot.&#xD;
.1 would shoot him like a dog. - But d-n&#xD;
you," he exclaimed with sudden vehe-&#xD;
mence, while his eyes blazed as none but&#xD;
his could, "have you done her any in-&#xD;
jury ? Have you taken any advantage&#xD;
of that girl, sir?"&#xD;
"No, no.  You know that I would&#xD;
scora to do that," replied Reis.&#xD;
"I believe you, and it is'well that it&#xD;
is so Reis;" he, continued in  calmer&#xD;
tone, ,".I Am surprised, at you. W I ay&#xD;

innocent females. I would have no&#xD;
Woman'sperson without her own consent.&#xD;
I have ead of robbers who deliberately&#xD;
ravished tender and delicate females, and&#xD;
afterwards cut their throats, but I des-&#xD;
pise them. I am no such robber, and I&#xD;
never will be. Reisk I ought to kill you,&#xD;
but since you have had 8ome honor and&#xD;
manhood about you in this rascally mat-&#xD;
ter, I will let you off this time. Get you&#xD;
in readiness, and we will, you and I&#xD;
alone, return this girl to her mother, if&#xD;
the poor old woman be alive, and forth-&#xD;
with set this matter right. I wouldn't&#xD;
at such a time as this, be bothered by a&#xD;
frivolous matter of this kind, for all the&#xD;
women in the world, spread out in a&#xD;
perfect sea of bosoms and lips !"&#xD;
Rosalie, who had been listening with&#xD;
intense interest to every word, at this&#xD;
moment sprang towards the young chief,&#xD;
whose appearance was far from forbid-&#xD;
ding, even to the most refined female,&#xD;
and in a fit of uncontrollable gratitude&#xD;
and rapture, at the prospect of her deliv.&#xD;
erance, threw her arms around his neck&#xD;
before she thought. Recovering her-&#xD;
self instantly, she thanked him in a dig-&#xD;
nified manner for his noble conduct, and&#xD;
told him that she respected him from&#xD;
the bottom -of her heart, robber as he&#xD;
was.&#xD;
Joaquin looked at her proudly, as he&#xD;
laid his hand upon his breast, and said:&#xD;
"Yes, Senorita, I am a man. I was&#xD;
once as noble a man as ever breathed,&#xD;
and if I am not so now, it is because men&#xD;
would not allow me to be as I wished.&#xD;
You shall return to your mother and to&#xD;
your lover, if I die in bringing it about."&#xD;
,On this same night at eleven- o'clock&#xD;
stood the frane house on the road that&#xD;
leads up on a branch of the South Fork&#xD;
of the Stanislaus River, the same as it&#xD;
was on , that happy, sorrowful night,&#xD;
when Rosalie was embraced by her&#xD;
lover, and torn from -his presence. In&#xD;
one of the rooms sat her old disconsolate&#xD;
Another, whose withering life was alone&#xD;
&#xD;
sustained by the hope of seeing her&#xD;
daughter again, and near her the young&#xD;
man Edward      . He was comforting-&#xD;
the old lady with assurances, -which did&#xD;
not quiet his own heat, for he had rid.&#xD;
den day and, night over one-half of the.&#xD;
county, making inquiries in every quar-&#xD;
ter, but'not a trace could he find of the&#xD;
missing girl or her abductor. His face&#xD;
was pale and thin with anxiety, and his.&#xD;
voice had something hollow in it, as-&#xD;
though the vampire of despair was suck-&#xD;
ing his heart's blood. lHe began to. be-&#xD;
lieve that his adored Rosalie was lost to.&#xD;
him forever, and wandoomed to a fate he-&#xD;
could not contemplate without ashudder-&#xD;
ing chill. . After soothing the feeble-&#xD;
brain of the old woman with what he&#xD;
knew to be the merest illusions, he had&#xD;
subsided into silence, and was eating his-&#xD;
heart in bitter regret, when a sudden&#xD;
tap was heard on the door and in a&#xD;
moment leaped into the room the very&#xD;
object of his thoughts. The neeting-&#xD;
,was such as might be expected.- But I&#xD;
will not fill this sheet with an attempt&#xD;
at a description of it. Edward's rapture,&#xD;
astonishment, bewilderment of joy I-the-&#xD;
old decrepid mother's scarce audible-&#xD;
syllables, and her far more expressive&#xD;
tears. Rapidly was her story recounted&#xD;
by Rosalie, and with such enthusiasm&#xD;
did she dwell on the heroic conduct of'&#xD;
Joaquin, that her lover almost became'&#xD;
jealous of the young robber. She made'&#xD;
him swear that he would never Injure-&#xD;
that man, whatever he might do to.&#xD;
others.t&#xD;
"I won't touch Joaquin," he replied,.&#xD;
"if he lets me alone, but as for that other&#xD;
bloody beast. I will kill him the first&#xD;
time I lay my eyes on him."&#xD;
Joaquin at this moment walked in,.&#xD;
and stood before the young mah. Reis.&#xD;
very prudently remained on tha outside,.&#xD;
after hearing the 'obseryation which haA&#xD;
just been made respecting him.&#xD;
"I have done you a favor, Sir, said&#xD;
Joaquin, "and now I want you' to keep&#xD;
&#xD;
this matter a profound secret. Never&#xD;
breathe my name out of this house. I&#xD;
will be iut this county for some time, but&#xD;
you apid yours shall not be troubled.-&#xD;
But if you betray me, I will scatter to&#xD;
the winds all that you have, and all that&#xD;
you love."&#xD;
" It is hard," said the young man, "to&#xD;
be under'obligations to.a man like you,&#xD;
but I will be silent."&#xD;
"1And who are you, pray, that talk as&#xD;
if it were stooping to be'under obliga-&#xD;
tions to a man like me ?" and the fiery&#xD;
spirit of Joaquin leaped into his eyes.&#xD;
He touched the hilt of his bowie-knife,&#xD;
when a supplicating look from Rosalie&#xD;
checked him.&#xD;
Edward--drew his revolver half out,&#xD;
but Rosalie touched his arm, and with a&#xD;
reproachful look, said to him---.&#xD;
"Fie, fie, Edward, you forget yourself.&#xD;
You wouldn't harm the man whohas re.&#xD;
st9pred me to your arms?. Why, Ed-&#xD;
ward, would you make me despise you?&#xD;
I care not If he were a robber a thousand&#xD;
times, he is a noble man; shake hands&#xD;
with him," and taking his hand with her&#xD;
left, and the robber's with her right, she&#xD;
joined tyem together with a gentle force.&#xD;
Sternly the young men looked at each&#xD;
other for a second, and then,-with a half-&#xD;
friendly, half-defiant smile, they parted.&#xD;
Joaquin and Reis rode off, the one&#xD;
somewhat reconciled to his subordinate,&#xD;
since the issue had been good, and the&#xD;
other delighted beyond all bounds at the&#xD;
happy turn which things had taken.&#xD;
"I would have given her up long&#xD;
ago," exclaimed Reis, " but my men&#xD;
would have killed me for it, I am certain.&#xD;
It was fortunate that you came wheli&#xD;
you did,'or the poor girl would have been&#xD;
far worse off than she is now, the beauti-&#xD;
fulcreature that she is!" said he, with&#xD;
enthusiasm.&#xD;
Iosale and Edward-, were shortly&#xD;
afgr married. They kept their secret&#xD;
wWile Joaquin lived, and for my par, I&#xD;
do not blame them.&#xD;

The new year opened-the ever mem-&#xD;

bandit was ready to enter upon a series&#xD;
of the bloodiest scenes that ever were&#xD;
enacted in the same space of time, in&#xD;
any age, or country. Calaveras county,&#xD;
,as I have said before, the richest, 'or&#xD;

operations, and never as a region so.&#xD;
scourged and desolated. Detached par-&#xD;

were scattered over the face of the whole&#xD;

There was not a town of any import.&#xD;
ance in that whole region in which he&#xD;
had not a spy, one or more, located; not&#xD;
-pue in which he had not his agents and&#xD;
secret friends. He lacked not for har-&#xD;
boring places in which to conceal his&#xD;
wounded men and stolen animals. Nu-&#xD;
'merous ranchos, owned by " wealthy and&#xD;
respectable men," as the world goes,&#xD;
hhave been mentioned to me as places&#xD;
whichh afforded him refuge and assis-&#xD;
tance whenever needed.  Among the&#xD;
'number which were named with particu-&#xD;
dar emphasis, were the Los Alamos Ran.&#xD;
.cho, on the Rio .Napoma, the Ortego&#xD;
Rancho and the Concho Rancho. Some&#xD;
-of the suspected ranchos, it is but justice&#xD;
Ao say, have since changed hands.&#xD;
Around San Andreas, Caliveritas and&#xD;
'Yackee Camp, numerous thefts and rob-&#xD;
beries had been committed in the space&#xD;
'of a ew weeks. Property was missed,&#xD;
but no one knew whither it was gone.&#xD;
Men were murdered, and the bloody&#xD;
hand- remained unseen. Yet everyone&#xD;
knew that thieves and murderers walked&#xD;
Amknown in the midst of the commu-&#xD;
nity.  The strange dread hung - over&#xD;
-every face, and gave vigilance to every&#xD;
-eye. The fearful shrunk back from a&#xD;
'danger which they could feel, but not&#xD;
see. The bold stood forward with their&#xD;
.ive in their hands, to search into, find&#xD;
"and face the perils which existed around&#xD;
'them, the more terrible that they were&#xD;
disguisedd and concealed.&#xD;
Among the boldest, most'firm and en-&#xD;
-ergetic, whom the crisis brought forth,&#xD;
-was Captain Charles H. Ellas, of San An-&#xD;
Areas, who -in his capacity as Deputy&#xD;
Sheriff'of Calaveras county, took the lead&#xD;

would not give the question of his rights&#xD;
to the arbitration of steel or of the dead.&#xD;

marks of severe and dangerous hand-to-&#xD;
hand conflicts,. a trial of muscle, nerve&#xD;
and skill, in a game whose stake is hu-&#xD;
man life, and whose hazard is eternity.&#xD;
At a juncture so important as the&#xD;
period of which I speak, a man like Elluas&#xD;
was most naturally looked to as a lead.&#xD;
er, and entrusted with a large amount of&#xD;
discretionary power, so necessary to be&#xD;
used in perilous times, when the slow&#xD;
forms of law, with their snail-like pro-&#xD;
cesses, are altogether useless ind inef-&#xD;
ficient.&#xD;
The first opportunity which presented&#xD;
itself for anything like determinate&#xD;
action, occurred about the middle of Jan-&#xD;
uary. Some horses were stolen at the&#xD;
town of San Andreas, and a description&#xD;
of the Mexicans who took them had been&#xD;
given to Captain Ellas,'who In the&#xD;
course of a day's ride -on the various&#xD;
roads, accidentally discovered the party&#xD;
on the road leading from Yaekee Camp&#xD;
to Chaparral Hill. They had added two&#xD;
to their number, who were not per-&#xD;
ceived, however, by the captain at the&#xD;
first glance. Seeing two mounted men&#xD;
on a small hill to the left of the road, he&#xD;
hailed them, and requested then to come'&#xD;
down as he had something to say. One&#xD;
of them replied:&#xD;
"If you want to see us more than we&#xD;
do you, come to us."&#xD;

f- shatt over his face, and flinging hi&#xD;
cloak a little back from his should&#xD;
dropped his arm down carelessly toward&#xD;
the butt 9f his pistol. In a moment mor&#xD;
he turned and walked off. Captain Ella&#xD;
will no doubt recollect the circunstan&#xD;
ce, and nmst not be surprised to lear&#xD;
that tls was none other than Joaquin&#xD;
himslf, who thus took"hip daguerreo&#xD;
type upon Imemory, and found it after&#xD;
wards of much avail n aiding him t&#xD;
escape danger, and to keep out of th&#xD;
way when he saw the original at the&#xD;
head of an armed party, or otherwise to&#xD;
direct his movements to the best advan&#xD;
stage.  The Captain did not at this time&#xD;
even know Joaquin was in the county,&#xD;
although the renowned robber's name&#xD;
was familiar to his ears, by the report of&#xD;
his depredations in other counties for a&#xD;
long time back.'&#xD;
The spies,, after the lapse of several&#xD;
days, returned with the information that&#xD;
they had discovered several lurking&#xD;
places of the robbers, among which was&#xD;
Chaparral Hill, a description of which it&#xD;
may be as well to give, inasmuch as it&#xD;
was the Scene of quite an interesting&#xD;
event.  It lies to the southwest of San&#xD;
Andreas about four miles, and is nothing&#xD;
more than an elevated pass between two&#xD;
steep ridges, which are crowned with&#xD;
precipitousrocks, whoseintersticeswould&#xD;
effetually conceal a man from observa-&#xD;
tion.'Thickets of chaparral cover vari-&#xD;
ous spots on the tops of the ridges, with&#xD;
open spaces between, and in many places&#xD;
the liveoak trees with low branches, and&#xD;
crooked knotty trunks, form a kind of&#xD;
natural fortification, almost as perfect as&#xD;
i they had been arranged expressly for&#xD;
the purpose. The pass itself is but a&#xD;
loweringof a long cnrving wall(a natu-&#xD;
ral wall) whichednnects the two ridges&#xD;
together, andbetween these ridges a Ing&#xD;
hollow leads up, and terminates at the&#xD;
pass. By the foot of the hollow run a'&#xD;
dear little stream,,margined with green&#xD;
alleid Willwareek, because it is&#xD;
&#xD;
.&#xD;
&#xD;
m   fringed so beautifully with the lithe and&#xD;
is graceful trees of that name.  ehindthe'&#xD;

e  covered  with nimense ,rease ood&#xD;
s  thickets, taller than a mai's head,&#xD;
- through which a party pursued could&#xD;
a  make a safe retreat, and though which&#xD;
, it would be dangerous to follow them,&#xD;
A few tall pines stand isolated here and&#xD;
there, on the different eminences, which&#xD;
o  shoot up in rugged majesty from' the&#xD;
e general outline. Oneridgeterminatesat&#xD;
the connecting wall, but, the other&#xD;
stretches on a mile or two beyond it,&#xD;
marked by a bridle trail, which suddenly&#xD;
plunges into a succession of deep ravines&#xD;
and gulches, lined with greasewood and&#xD;
low timber-lonely and sombre looking&#xD;
places I From this pass, or any place&#xD;
adjacent, a view of the country is com-&#xD;
manded many miles in extent.&#xD;
A few days after the return of the&#xD;
spies, a gentleman by the name of Hall,&#xD;
who kept a rancho on the road leading&#xD;
from Mokelumne Hill to San Andr&#xD;
called on Ellas and- informed him that&#xD;
three Mexicans .had passed his house&#xD;
that morning, who looked suspicious,-&#xD;
they having but two horses, and one of&#xD;
the men in consequence mounted behind&#xD;
another. One of these men hiad been&#xD;
detained by him at his house, having&#xD;
stopped but a few moments while the&#xD;
others rode on, but remained no longer&#xD;
than he saw fit after all, foi upon the&#xD;
first movements towards preventing his&#xD;
free agency, he drew a revolver and&#xD;
walked out. Hall and a man named&#xD;
Davis followed the party about a mile,&#xD;
and saw where thef had left the main&#xD;
road, and  ione up Murray's Creek. '&#xD;
Ellas mounted his horse, accompanied&#xD;
by his fiend, a young lawyer of fine&#xD;
parts, by the name of Why. J. Gatewood,&#xD;
who had practiced at squirrels and tur-&#xD;
keys In the woods as much as he had&#xD;
practiced at the bar, and was as  killful&#xD;
in drawing a."bead' as i drawing a&#xD;
brief-and attended also by Hall, Dayls&#xD;

and another man whose name is not re.&#xD;
membered--HaU being proirided ,with i as&#xD;
pistol =Davis with a'rifle, and the other&#xD;
man-with ayager.- -The party numbered&#xD;
five',-hastily gotten up,; and but, poorly&#xD;
preparedfot a combat ; but supposing he&#xD;
was only on the track of three Mexicans,&#xD;
the Captain proceeded- o4 their trail.&#xD;
Immediately after; starting he met a&#xD;
gentleman named Peter; Woodbeck,&#xD;
whom, having a little business with, he&#xD;
requested to ride back a short distance&#xD;
withthe company. Arriving at Murray'sI&#xD;
Creek he struck a fresh trail of two&#xD;
horses, se expected, about a mile from&#xD;
San Andreas, leading behind, a ridge of&#xD;
mountains that skirted -that little town&#xD;
-showing that the riders had kept them-&#xD;
selves concealed from view of the main&#xD;
road, until immediately opposite San&#xD;
Andreas, at which point they had evi-&#xD;
dently ridden to the top of the ridge, and&#xD;
who no doubt saw their pursuers start&#xD;
out, and at the same time counted their&#xD;
number. The trail from this point led&#xD;
over the mountains towards. Yackee&#xD;
Camp, which'gaveEllas to suppose they&#xD;
were a part of the band said to, be' lurk-&#xD;
Ing about Chaparral Hill. He immedi-&#xD;
ately sent Peter Woodbeck . to San&#xD;
Andreas with a request to Alcalde Talia-&#xD;
ferro to send two parties of men, each&#xD;
numbering five, and have them stationed&#xD;
on the different trails leading from the&#xD;
Chapairal Hill. The Alcalde being ill,&#xD;
was unable to attend personally to the&#xD;
request, but used every exertion in hi&#xD;
power by his agents, to raise the tw(&#xD;
iwrties needed, unfortunately withou&#xD;
succes.,'Under the impression that th&#xD;
men would be stationed as desired, th&#xD;
Captain rode on. The trail wound alonh&#xD;
in a very circuitous manner over thi&#xD;
roughest possible places, so that it wa&#xD;
in the afternoon before he reached th&#xD;
foot of the hollow before spoken of, a&#xD;
Willow. Creek, only four miles from Sa&#xD;
Andrews Ascending the hollow, th&#xD;
pursuing party immediately saw on tb&#xD;
curve of the pass of Chaparral Hil&#xD;
&#xD;
several Mexicans mounted upon fMe&#xD;
horses and -rode up towards them until&#xD;
within .rifle shot,, when they halted.,&#xD;
Two or three of the Mexicans rode down&#xD;
behind some bushes and rocks on the&#xD;
slant, and commenced firingS at them,&#xD;
with :Colt's heavy pistols, bat without&#xD;
effet  Ellas and party immediately&#xD;
shifted their position to a place within&#xD;
fair pistol shot, during which movement&#xD;
Davis levelled his rifle at a fellow par-&#xD;
tially hid in the rocks, and evidently hit&#xD;
him. The man with the yager in;vain&#xD;
tried to fire it-it would not " go off'.&#xD;
and  the  weapon  remained   useless&#xD;
through the whole fight, as well as the&#xD;
bearer of it, who had. nothing else with&#xD;
which to do battle.   Though -sadly&#xD;
needed he stood neutral, as far as any,&#xD;
service he could do was concerned, but&#xD;
served admirably well as a target for&#xD;
the bandits to -practice at, nevertheless.&#xD;
To aggravate the state of things, Davis,&#xD;
after discharging his rifle, could find no&#xD;
more bullets in his pouch, and was thus&#xD;
also rendered unable to do anything.&#xD;
Only three men therefore were left to do&#xD;
the, fighting I The Mexicans -noticing&#xD;
this dilemma, dashed along ' the curve&#xD;
of the hill,'nine in number, splendidly&#xD;
mounted and well 'armed-some were&#xD;
observed to have two -revolvers each.&#xD;
While passing they fired about twenty&#xD;
shots, but were riding so rapidly that&#xD;
they could notshoot with much precision.&#xD;
As it ;was, Gatewood's mule was se-&#xD;
s verely wounded in the neck, and bled&#xD;
o  profusely. A ball passed across Ellas'&#xD;
t  breast, burning a hole in the side of his&#xD;
e  vest, and another went through his hair.&#xD;
e  After this swoop of theirs they retired&#xD;
g  to their first position. Aportion of them&#xD;
e  then dismounting, crept down behind&#xD;
a  the bushes, so as to get near enough to&#xD;
e  Ellas' party to make a dead shot, and&#xD;
t . commenced firing, but not with the de-&#xD;
n  sired certainty, for Ellas and Gatewood&#xD;
e - had dismounted, and were somewhat&#xD;
e  protected by their animals. The Cap-&#xD;
l, tain finding an opportunity for the first&#xD;

tine to fire with any chance of' hitting&#xD;

the edge of a bush, who suddenlyretire&#xD;
to thetop othehe hil.  ipon the repor&#xD;
of his pistolhis ma;rea-fine, well traine&#xD;
animal, went down the hollow abqui&#xD;
four - hundred yards towards Willovw&#xD;
Creek; when one of the mounted Mexi&#xD;
canssdashed around as if to secure her.&#xD;
She-ran- back towards Eilas, and the&#xD;
Meican followed to within seventy&#xD;
yards, immediately below him. Ellas&#xD;
fireal, and the fellow sunk on the neck of&#xD;
his horse, apparently badly wounded.&#xD;
Four or five of the Mexicans noticing&#xD;
this, galloped along the ridge towards&#xD;
the side of the hill to which the wounded&#xD;
Mexican had retired, and effeetually cov-&#xD;
ered his position, so that it was impossi-&#xD;
ble toapproach him without receiving&#xD;
their fire. He was then wrapping his&#xD;
red scarf around his breast, as if endeav-&#xD;
oring to- stop the blood. Ellas' horse&#xD;
soon dashed to the left of the Mexicans,&#xD;
and came up to him, when he mounted&#xD;
and led his party around towards the&#xD;
right hand ridge, in order to gain the&#xD;
summit, if possible, which object he&#xD;
hoped to 'effect while the opposing force&#xD;
was somewhat separated. In passing&#xD;
under a steeprocky place, Gatewood ex-&#xD;
claimed, " There is a Mexican above us I"&#xD;
and had scarcely finished the sentence&#xD;
before the fellow commenced firing with&#xD;
his revolver. He fired three distinct&#xD;
shots at a distance of not more than forty&#xD;
yards. Ellas suddenly wheeling his&#xD;
horse, discovered him almost perpendic-&#xD;
ularly over his heai not more thin&#xD;
thirty yards distant, mounted upon a&#xD;
white horse; and taking a steady aim&#xD;
with his six-shooter, pulled the trigger.&#xD;
The Mexican fell back 'upon his saddle,&#xD;
wounded in the breast, but soon recover-&#xD;
ing himself put spurs to his horse and&#xD;
darted out of sight.      0&#xD;
Up to this'time the Captain had -con-&#xD;
cluded to risk this very disadvantageous&#xD;
battle, in the hope that the two parties&#xD;
&#xD;
, sent by Peter Woodbeck wold; maite&#xD;
a  on the two trails in,,the rear of theerobe&#xD;
d  bera ibut ;finding that they wroe ,not&#xD;
t likely to come;, and knowing~that'hewas,&#xD;
I  exposing himself and his comrades to be:&#xD;
t shot down in detail from behind the rocks&#xD;
and bushes, he decided to retire ,to the,,&#xD;
foot of the hollow, where his opponents&#xD;
could not assail him without exposure ta&#xD;
themselves  They did not follow him,&#xD;
and after a shortconsultation with his,&#xD;
comrades, he started back for San An.,&#xD;
dreas, which he reached withoutdifficul1&#xD;
ty, and immediately proceeded to organ,&#xD;
ize a party. While doing this, word&#xD;
came from Yackee Camp that six men,&#xD;
evidently, of-the, same band, had come&#xD;
down into that place from the -direetion&#xD;
of Chaparral, Hill, and without, a mo.&#xD;
ment's parley, had commenced killing&#xD;
the few Americans with whom they hap.&#xD;
opened to meet. Joaquin (for it was with.&#xD;
him that Ellas had been fighting with.&#xD;
out knowing it) rode among the houses&#xD;
during the shooting, and remarked:&#xD;
"This is not my fight; this Is Bill's&#xD;
fight," alludingto an affray between one&#xD;
of his friends, named Bill, who was a'&#xD;
Mexican gambler in the place, and some-&#xD;
Americans, which had occi-ded a short&#xD;
time before.&#xD;
When this remark was made Three.&#xD;
Fingered Jack discharged his pistol at,&#xD;
an American who was standing near,&#xD;
and killed him on the spot. Another&#xD;
American whom   Joaquin recognized,&#xD;
started to run; he was on foot, but ran,&#xD;
with as much speed over 'the rough&#xD;
ground, which had been dug up and&#xD;
ditched in various places by the miners,&#xD;
as did the robber chief, who pursued him&#xD;
on horseback. Leaping and plunging&#xD;
through the holes and ditches, Joaquin&#xD;
shot at him six times without effect, and&#xD;
having thus emptied his- six-shooter.&#xD;
finally threw athim histwo.edged sword,&#xD;
which barely missed the poor fellow's&#xD;
neck just as he escaped in a ledge of'&#xD;
rocks It was a trying scene for any&#xD;

such as he would n9t soon forget. Joa-&#xD;

his sword, and rods a    into town,&#xD;
swearing that he would get even on that&#xD;
day's work ifit took him twenty years&#xD;
for he had lost three of his best men on&#xD;
Chaparral Hill.&#xD;
"G.-d d----n that little Sheriff of San&#xD;
Andreas," said he,, "Iknew him all the&#xD;
time"&#xD;
Soon- after, having cleared out the&#xD;
Americans in Yackee Camp, he galloped&#xD;
off with his men, numbering six, over&#xD;
the hills towards the mountains, leaving&#xD;
one wounded horse, which had been&#xD;
shot at the late skirmish at the pass.&#xD;
Upon receiving this information, Ellas&#xD;
-started for Yadhee Camp with his party,&#xD;
consisting of six mounted men, followed&#xD;
by some thirty citizens of San Andreas,&#xD;
on foot. Arriving at the tragical scene,&#xD;
they immediately seized the Mexican&#xD;
gambler Bill, who had been foolish&#xD;
enough to remain after Joaquin's remark&#xD;
about him, and having subjected him to&#xD;
a California trial, they sentenced him to&#xD;
be hung "forthwith," as a member of&#xD;
'Joaquin's band. He begged them earn-&#xD;
estly to spare his life, but finding it was&#xD;
in vain, his brow darkened, and with an&#xD;
air of proud defiance he told them to do&#xD;
their work.&#xD;
" By going to my trunk," said he,&#xD;
" you will find a knife, from whose blade&#xD;
no handkerchief has yet wiped the d-d&#xD;
American blood."&#xD;
This speech did not serve to, mollify&#xD;
the state of feeling toward him, and he&#xD;
was jerked up into a tree, and strangled&#xD;
with very little ceremony.&#xD;
It was now a late hour in the night,&#xD;
but there remained a finishing stroke to&#xD;
be put upon the proceedings before retir-&#xD;
ing to rest. The harboring places and&#xD;
dens of the robbers were found out, and&#xD;
the enraged citizens went to work tear-&#xD;
ing down and burning up the houses of&#xD;
this character. The cofiagration lit up&#xD;
&#xD;
the vault of heaven, And its sound roared&#xD;
among the mountains for iiles-around&#xD;
Around theasmnouldering ruins, guards&#xD;
and pickets were stationed till morning&#xD;
and the wearied citizens slept.&#xD;

edmedo*n- full of vengeance, as far? as&#xD;
the Phoenix Quarts Mill, , few miles&#xD;
from.Yackee Camp; and there had met&#xD;
tw  Americans whoin he had immedi-&#xD;
ately attacked. One of them was Peter&#xD;
Woodbeek, who was known by the rob.&#xD;
bears, having been markedby them when&#xD;
-on the day before Ellas had sent him back&#xD;
with word to Alcalde Taliaferro. He&#xD;
was just mounting his horse at the&#xD;
quartz mill, when Joaquin rode up.&#xD;
You are my meat," said Joaquin, and&#xD;
drew his-revolver.  Woodbeck replied,&#xD;
We will see," and drew his. Three.&#xD;
Fingered Jack rode towards Woodbeck's&#xD;
companion, who, being on hoot, fired one&#xD;
shot from a derringer pistol and dashed&#xD;
into the mill. Three-Fingered Jack, after&#xD;
emptying two loads at him as he fled,'&#xD;
which perforated the building near the&#xD;
door, dismountedand rushed, with bowie&#xD;
knife in hand after him. There a des-&#xD;
perate hand to hand conflict ensued, the&#xD;
American defending himself with a short&#xD;
bar of iron. ButThreeFingered Jack&#xD;
triumphed, and his bowie knife drank-,&#xD;
the poor fellow's heart's blood. He came&#xD;
dragging- him out by the hair of the&#xD;
head, ans1 the fight between Woodbeck&#xD;
and Joaquin was still going on, the re.&#xD;
lative positions of the two not allowing&#xD;
any chance for Joaquin's friends to as-&#xD;
sist him.  Woodbeck being wounded,&#xD;
and havingemptied his revolver at his&#xD;
antagonist without effect, now put spurs&#xD;
to his horse to fly thefield, and was nearly&#xD;
out of pistol range when Three-Fingered&#xD;
Jack fired at the horse andstruck him so'&#xD;
centre a shot that he fell dead in his&#xD;
tracks. The bloody monster then rushed&#xD;
up and"finished " the unfortunate rider&#xD;
upon the spot-&#xD;
The bodies of these men. were yet&#xD;
warm when Ellas and his company rode&#xD;
up, and "stood horrified at the bloody&#xD;
spectacle.&#xD;
The trail of the murderers from the&#xD;
Qu4rtz Mill was plain, leading over the&#xD;
San Domingo Creek range of mountains,&#xD;
following which Ellas and company met&#xD;
&#xD;
with the foot company, which hadi be&#xD;
detailed to gothrodgh the toigher pit&#xD;
of the mountaius section near thie&#xD;
Cherokee Plat. They gavehim sein -&#xD;
teresting Informatton, whi'ch- wdW,"ther&#xD;
they hid found clothing which had e l-&#xD;
denfly been thrown froti a woundedmn;&#xD;
and upon the discovery had proaseded&#xD;
immediately to a camp not far off, where&#xD;
they found two Mexicans, one of them,&#xD;
badly wounded. The sound one rose to&#xD;
his feet, and started at full speed, but&#xD;
was shot,.so that he died in a short time&#xD;
afterwards in an adjacent ~thicket to&#xD;
which he ran before he fell. This indi-&#xD;
vidual was not a "fighting member.,"&#xD;
but rather a sly and secret friend, who&#xD;
had volunteered to take care of one of&#xD;
Joaquin's wounded men, wfio had been&#xD;
hit in the skirmish at Chaparral Hill the&#xD;
day before. They also saw in a neigh-&#xD;
boring thicket of chaparral three other'&#xD;
mounted men of the robber band, whom&#xD;
they did not find an opportunity to at-&#xD;
tack. The wounded man was still lying&#xD;
at the camp, unable to get out of the&#xD;
way without help. It was dark when&#xD;
Ellas received this information, but do&#xD;
termined to lose no opportunity of meet-&#xD;
ing with the scoundrels, he stationed&#xD;
men around the chaparral thickets to&#xD;
watch during the night, sent others to&#xD;
arrest the wounded robber at the camp,&#xD;
and to convey him to Cherokee Flat, and&#xD;
hurried off two others to! two different,&#xD;
ferries on the Stanislaus River, with&#xD;
orders to the ferrymen to allow no one&#xD;
to cross. The wounded man being a&#xD;
trouble upon their hands, and no doubt&#xD;
being entertained as to his character, the&#xD;
Cherokee half-breeds, and others at the&#xD;
Cherokee House, concluded to hing him,&#xD;
a very necessary ceremony, which was&#xD;
soon performed&#xD;
Ellas lay watching the camp from&#xD;
which the wounded robber had been&#xD;
taken, all night, in the hope that some&#xD;
of his companions might come; but none&#xD;
arrived. Early in the morning he gath-&#xD;
ered his party and started on a bush&#xD;

to- the bank of the Calavera BVeii&#xD;
which he crossedfinding the trail With-&#xD;
out much difficulty. It ranup theriver&#xD;
a shot distance, and re-crossed it. The&#xD;
Captain did the same,.and found itagain&#xD;
upon the first bank. It led out a short&#xD;
distance towards Angel's- Camp, a little&#xD;
mining town a few miles off,but doubled&#xD;
upon itself again, and again crosedlie&#xD;
river. It was now dark, and Impossible&#xD;
to find the lost triil, even if it had been&#xD;
practicable to follow it when found. The&#xD;
pursuit was accordingly given up for&#xD;
that night. The next morning -the Cap-&#xD;
tain rode up to an isolated house in a&#xD;
wild section of the mountains, where&#xD;
lived a rough looking Mexican, solitary&#xD;
and alone, and discovered at his door&#xD;
the tracks of several horses, which he&#xD;
knew were the same horses that had&#xD;
made the trail of the day before, from&#xD;
the peculiarity in one of the hoof, which'&#xD;
was very distinctly impressed at every&#xD;
step. The ill-looking fellow denied all&#xD;
knowledge of any mounted men havizf&#xD;
been to his house. A lariat was speedily&#xD;
attached to his neck, and he was sent up&#xD;
into atreetoseeifhe culldmot obtain the&#xD;
desired information. Having boe s6nt&#xD;
up twice, he ascertained the important&#xD;
fact that Joaquin had passed his house&#xD;
the night before with two other men,&#xD;
- and had told'him that he wa   u going to&#xD;
n  Campo Seco, on his way to the city of&#xD;
Marysville in the northern country-&#xD;
that the neighborhood was getting too&#xD;
warm for him, and he wanted a little&#xD;
fresh air ; that he intended to return,ftr&#xD;
e  he would never rest satisfied until he&#xD;
d  had the heart's blood, of Elks and the&#xD;
.e  Mexican who had put the Captain on his&#xD;
*e trail, etc.&#xD;
r.   The next day after this the Captain&#xD;
al  ascertained that Joaquin had crossed the&#xD;
il StanislausRiver at Lancha Plana with&#xD;
d  his party,. forcing the ferryman; to- act&#xD;
n- contrary to orders, and put him over.&#xD;
n  He had scarcely landed on the other&#xD;
y. side when he was attacked by Ament-&#xD;
n  cans, for it-must be bone in mind that&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7584-00000035"/>&#xD;
t;h whole country was aroused, who be-&#xD;
ingsuperior in number, poured hot lead&#xD;
into his midst with such bewildering&#xD;
rapidity that he was compelled to fly&#xD;
with the utmost precipitation, leaving&#xD;
in, his hurry several very fine loose&#xD;
horses. It was supposed that -he soon&#xD;
, afterward swam the river at another&#xD;
place, andwas still in the neighborhood.&#xD;
Accompanied by a gentleman from An-&#xD;
gel's Camp, Ellas went to the fastnesses&#xD;
of the Bear Mountain range, in the hope&#xD;
to disOver fresh trails; found one which&#xD;
led towards a camp called Los Muertos;&#xD;
the tracks indicating that there were&#xD;
five mounted men. Being in no, condi-&#xD;
tion to follow them, he rode over to Cher-&#xD;
okee Flat,. and requested a number of&#xD;
Cherokees, locates there, to go out and&#xD;
way-lay-the different trails between Bear&#xD;
Mountain and San Domingo Range, to&#xD;
,which they readily assented. In the&#xD;
meantime a meeting of the citizens was&#xD;
held at Carson's Creek, to take measures&#xD;
in.the pressing exigency, which was up-&#xD;
that district, in common with others.&#xD;
AMexican was noticed in the meeting&#xD;
attentively noticing its proceedings, who&#xD;
as soon as it was broken up, was seen to&#xD;
gq to a bakery, purchase a quantity of&#xD;
bread; and start of on foot toward Bear&#xD;
1Mountain. He was followed and seized&#xD;
on the side of the mountain,' and at the&#xD;
same time his captors discovered three&#xD;
Mexicans riding on the ridge a few hun-&#xD;
dred yards above them. One of these&#xD;
was Joaquin, and the others were Reis&#xD;
and Valenzuela. The captive ,Mexican. -&#xD;
was hurried away to Cherokee Flat,&#xD;
where he was questioned closely in re-&#xD;
g   d to his conduct. ' He played the&#xD;
part of an idiot, and would have sue-&#xD;
ceeded in convincing  the attendantI&#xD;
orqwd that he was really a poor imbecile,-&#xD;
had he, not been very well known byI&#xD;
some of "the boys.", -To bring him toa&#xD;
his senses, hemp'was suggested as a very&#xD;
e~caious thig in such eases, and hea&#xD;
wasjaecordinglyelevatedinto the top of I&#xD;
a treeto, takea view of the surrounding  i&#xD;
&#xD;
country. The remedy operated upon hi.&#xD;
ailment like a charm, and he confessed&#xD;
without hesitation that hekiew Joa-&#xD;
quin, Reis, Valenzuela and numerotp,&#xD;
others of the banditti-: and that; Joaqula&#xD;
was at this time not far off,, to whom he&#xD;
was taking provisioxis when he was ap-&#xD;
prehended. -A  doubt arising In thea&#xD;
minds of some persons, not noted for de-&#xD;
cision of character, as to whether it was&#xD;
right to put the fellow to death, Ellas&#xD;
left him in charge of the two Cherokee&#xD;
half-breeds, with the request that they&#xD;
would give a good account of him, were-&#xD;
upon the crowd dispersed.'At about&#xD;
twelve o'clock in the night, the Chero-&#xD;
kees went to Ellas' house in San An-&#xD;
dreas, and informed him tlgt they were&#xD;
ready to give "'a good account "6f the-&#xD;
Mex;ican. Nothing more was said on&#xD;
the subject, and the next day ie was&#xD;
found hanging on a tree by the side of&#xD;
the road.&#xD;
Several weeks had now transpired&#xD;
since the fight on Chaparral Hill, and&#xD;
notwithstanding the most diligent pur-&#xD;
suit had been made after the robbers yet&#xD;
during the whole time they had been&#xD;
busily engaged in murder,A-eft and&#xD;
plunder.  They left a broad and bloody&#xD;
trail wherever they went, and comit-&#xD;
ted their outrages at times in the very&#xD;
sight, of their pursuers. Frequently&#xD;
were the harrowing cries of "murder '&#xD;
heard just ahead, and hurrying -to the&#xD;
spot, citizens were found weltering in&#xD;
their blood, while the audacious bandits&#xD;
were seen riding off with no great evi-&#xD;
dence of fear at being overtaken. The&#xD;
bAnditti were divided the greater part of&#xD;
the time, into small companies of four or&#xD;
five; and Joaquin was, seldom seen with'&#xD;
more than three followers.. Three-Fin-&#xD;
gered Jack was his constant attendant.&#xD;
Vulvia was-in the field ; Reis was active,&#xD;
and Valenzuela was far from idle.&#xD;
On the 5th of February a Mexicanwas&#xD;
arrested-by the citizen's at Angel's Camp.&#xD;
As soon as it was done, a young $onor-&#xD;
an gambler ran to a horse, hitched ats&#xD;

what had'tfianslred, when a pistol-was  tI&#xD;
cociekdin his face, and he was stopped. n&#xD;
Inn a few moments it was ascertained  d&#xD;
that the inA  arrested was one of Joa- u&#xD;
quiti's band and hei soon made his exit t]&#xD;
into eternity, from the braili of an oak '&#xD;
tree, which yet stands at Angel's Camp  f&#xD;
as one of its memorials.             a&#xD;
Three or four Germans sleeping in -a  s&#xD;
tent on a rather lonesome ravine, near a&#xD;
to Angel's Creek, a few nightsbefore the  t&#xD;
eveit-last mentioned, were surprised to  f&#xD;
find themselves suddenly tied hand ande&#xD;
foot, in their beds, and still more horri-&#xD;
fied when a scowling band of ruffians&#xD;
stood over thiem with drawn sabres,&#xD;
which they drew across their throats soI&#xD;
'arelessly that it started the blood. The&#xD;
Gefmans eagerly  ,delivered up what&#xD;
tontiey they had, which amounted to the&#xD;
piifus aii of two hundred dollars; at&#xD;
whihthre-Fingered Jack, for he was&#xD;
there with his leader, jumped up with an&#xD;
oath that _nade the poor fellows quiver&#xD;
whefe they lay, and declared that he&#xD;
' would aig their hearts out of them for&#xD;
not having any more, suiting his action&#xD;
to the word by brandishing his knife over&#xD;
their heads, and waving it to and fro&#xD;
withinn an inch of their windpipes. Joa-&#xD;
quin, however, interfered and prevented&#xD;
him from executing hii threat, remark-&#xD;
ing that it was better to let them live,,&#xD;
Ashe might wish to collect taxes off them&#xD;
for "Foreign Miners' License,". at some&#xD;
other time.&#xD;
One Alexander Bidenger and his friend&#xD;
G. J. Mansfield, residing at a little place&#xD;
called Capulope, having learned from&#xD;
two friendly MemIcans that Joaquinlad&#xD;
slept there on the night of the second of&#xD;
February, with other important informa-&#xD;
tion; concluded to send word to Justice&#xD;
Beatty the presiding magistrate  at&#xD;
Campo Seco, not a great way off, and&#xD;
having written a letter despatched it by&#xD;
" Diggei Mxpress."&#xD;
&#xD;
To those unacquainted with Califorida&#xD;
ustomspit may be necessary t plain,&#xD;
hat it is common in theimountainsard&#xD;
dining districts to employ Digger Iu-&#xD;
ians as bearers of letters, or runners&#xD;
ipon errands,-from one point to another,&#xD;
heylbeing very expeditious on foot, and&#xD;
willing to travel a considerable distant&#xD;
or a small piece of bread, freshmeator&#xD;

swim rivers, when the waters were high&#xD;
and dangerous, in order to carry a letter&#xD;
o its destination. They are exceedingly&#xD;
faithful in this business, having a super-&#xD;
stitious dread of that mysterious power.&#xD;
which makes a, paper talk without a.&#xD;
mouth.&#xD;
The naked expressman having been&#xD;
hunted up, he was charged by Bidenger&#xD;
to proceed to Campo Sedo without delay,&#xD;
and to allow no one on the way to read&#xD;
the paper.. The Digger, as in usual&#xD;
with these native expresses, got him a&#xD;
small stick about two feet long,.and split-&#xD;
ing the dud to the ddpth of an inh or&#xD;
two, stuck the letter into it,-and, old-&#xD;
ing it out i front of him, started olr',in&#xD;
a fast trot. One Of.Joaquin's party -dis-&#xD;
covered him on the road -abot there&#xD;
miles from Campo .eco, and wishedto&#xD;
speak to him, but thelIadian, remember-&#xD;
ing his charge, broke off at full speed,&#xD;
bearing the letter triumphantly before&#xD;
him. The robber fired       c two shots dt th&#xD;
terrified native, which only -acce ht&#xD;
his flight.  Arriving at Campo Seco he&#xD;
entered Beatty's office,and'handed-him&#xD;
the following unique epistle:&#xD;

Winter's Bar, toilet io one cross during&#xD;
the night, believing that, from its prox&#xD;
imity, "that point: would' be selected by&#xD;
the robber-for the passage of the river&#xD;
in case he wasclosely pursued, and hur&#xD;
ried off -the Constable with a posse to&#xD;
rescue the six unfortunate men whom&#xD;
Joaquin had "'tide" out, in the hills.&#xD;
Arriving at Capulope in great heat, the&#xD;
Constable ascertained that there were no&#xD;
-six men tied out talll, but that the let-&#xD;
ter had designed to inform the Justice&#xD;
that Jopquin's party numbered six men.&#xD;
"It's a pity," -said Bidenger, "that a&#xD;
man of the Squire's-larnin' can't read no&#xD;
better than that.  .,-        .&#xD;
t Nothing was seen of Joaquin in. the&#xD;
neighborhood,. though diligent, search&#xD;
was made for him by the Constable froni&#xD;
the time he left Campo Seco util dark,&#xD;
but at midnight he rode up to the ferry,&#xD;
at Winter's Bar, and requested to be set&#xD;
over. The keepers informed him, that&#xD;
they had orders from-the civil 'authori-&#xD;
ties to let no one pass; not even the Gov.-&#xD;
ernor of the State, whereupon the impa&#xD;
tient outlaw made such unequivocal, hos-&#xD;
tile demonstrations,_that the ferrymen&#xD;
were glad to.set aside the civil author-&#xD;
ities, and for the time being, to obey&#xD;
martial law.&#xD;
L A few days after this, riding .along&#xD;
with Three-Fingered Jack, and another&#xD;
member named Pedro, Joaquin met two&#xD;
Americans and a German coming on foot&#xD;
from the direction of Murphy's Diggings,&#xD;
and bound for Australia; as their fgnal&#xD;
destination. They were laden with gold&#xD;
dust, which they iend'ed to convert&#xD;
into bills tof exchange at SanFrancisco,&#xD;
and committed the great imprudence to&#xD;
run at the approach of the bandits, who,&#xD;
having been hotly pursued a few hours&#xD;
before by a party of citizens, might have&#xD;
passed on without harming them. See-&#xD;
ing them take flight, Joaquin said:&#xD;
&#xD;
s "Those fellowshavemoney; we i 1s"&#xD;
kill them."p&#xD;
.    T-he poor, terrified.fugitives each  Op&#xD;
a, separate course,and it wasiotn0 g&#xD;
before- they miserably peishedunder&#xD;
- the murderous-pistols and knives of the&#xD;
bandits. Dragging fhen;by the hees,,&#xD;
the robbers, who had sweured-thirteayy&#xD;
- purses, threw them into a hole rhich:&#xD;
had been sunk by some prospectors, nd&#xD;
L covered them partially with leaves and&#xD;
bushes.,&#xD;
Riding on a little farther, upon nar-&#xD;
row pack-trail, which wound along on&#xD;
the bank of a foaming'- stream that was&#xD;
almost hid in the deep gorge through&#xD;
which it ran, they suddenly came .upon&#xD;
a Chinese camp, containing six China-&#xD;
men. Though qach had a double-bar-&#xD;
srelled shot-gun, they made no effortto&#xD;
defend themselves, but begged for 'their&#xD;
lives. Joaquin was disposed to spare&#xD;
them,-but not wishing to leave his por-&#xD;
trait impressed upon too many memories,&#xD;
which might prove some day quite too&#xD;
tenaciousforhis good,hiconcluded to kll&#xD;
Jack, by a nod from Joaquin, stepped&#xD;
as well as rob them. Three-Fingered&#xD;
upto each one, and led himbut' byhis-.&#xD;
long tail of hair, repeating the ceremony&#xD;
until they all stood in arow before him.&#xD;
He then tied their tails securely together,&#xD;
searched their pockets, while Pedro ran-&#xD;
sacked their tents, and, drawing his&#xD;
highly-prized home-made knife , com-&#xD;
menced, amid the howling and shrieksof&#xD;
the unfortunate Asiatics,; splitting their&#xD;
skulls and severing their neck veins.&#xD;
He was in his element, his eyes blazed,&#xD;
he shouted like a madman, and leaped&#xD;
from one to the other, hewing and out-&#xD;
ting,,as if it afforded hint the most ex-&#xD;
quisite satisfaction to revel in human&#xD;
agony.&#xD;
" Come," said Joaquin, "that's enough,&#xD;
mount up, and let's be off."&#xD;
Reaching the main road again In a&#xD;
few hours they met the mail-rider be.&#xD;
tween Jackson and Volcano, who, on per-&#xD;
ceiving them laid whip t6 his very flet&#xD;
&#xD;

hil laughing over the very exhilar-&#xD;

was within one hundred yards of the&#xD;
brigands before he perceived them.&#xD;
Three-Fingered Jack's appearance was&#xD;
enough for him without any-further ex-&#xD;

miles, up the hills and down, Joaquin&#xD;
and Pedro a short distance behind, and&#xD;
the "Knight of the Three-Fingers" close&#xD;
on to the fugitive, who spared neither&#xD;
whip nor spur; at one time grasping at&#xD;
his bridle-rein, at another falling beld&#xD;
his horse's tail, and at another shooting&#xD;
at him with an unsuccessful aim. Strag-&#xD;
.gling travelers on'the road, Jew ped-&#xD;
deis, almond-eyed Chinamen, and de-&#xD;
plorably ragged looking|Frenchman, all,&#xD;
and'everybody who happened to be on&#xD;
the road, gave way to the frantic rider&#xD;
and his head-loig pursuers, gazing at&#xD;
them with unmitigated astonishment,&#xD;
and thanking their stars that they hap-&#xD;
pened 'to 'be poor obscure foot-men.&#xD;
Horsely rode on, and on, and 'on, with&#xD;
inbated ardor on his oWn part, and no&#xD;

XxNumerous murders having been corn-&#xD;
mitted, and many parties having failed&#xD;
to capture the leasling desperadoes, an&#xD;
excitement prevailed, almost too intense&#xD;
to be borne, in the whole - county of&#xD;
Calaveras.&#xD;
About 'the 19th ,of February, a large-&#xD;
meetint was held at the town of Jack-&#xD;
son, at which it was resolved that every-&#xD;
body should turn out in search of the-&#xD;
villain Joaquin. A committee of six ien&#xD;
were secretly sent at midnight to Mokel-&#xD;
umne Hill to secure a concert of action&#xD;
there; upon whose arrival, the citizenis&#xD;
immediately assembled, andbefore morn-&#xD;
ing two companies were organized, hose&#xD;
and foot, and placed under the command&#xD;
of Charles A. Clark, Esq., then Under-&#xD;
Sheriff 'of the 'county. Thus was the&#xD;
whole couritry alive with armed parties&#xD;
whose separate movements it-would be&#xD;
impossible, 'without - much unneessary&#xD;
labor, to trace.' Arrests were continually&#xD;
being made popular tribunals 'estab-&#xD;

touches here and there, that anidea may&#xD;
be- gathered of the exciting ,picture&#xD;
which the state of things then presented.&#xD;
The Jackson Company Went down on&#xD;
the west side of the Mokelumne Iiver,&#xD;
while Clark directed his companies to&#xD;
sor the woods, and mountains in the&#xD;
direction of Clampo Seco. ,Fiom Cainpo&#xD;

Prescott, at the moment Joaquin fired&#xD;
at the candle holder, discharged both&#xD;
barrels of his shot-gun into the robber's&#xD;
breast, and was amazed to see him staid&#xD;

to the floor, a ball having passed clean&#xD;
through his chest.. The other bandits&#xD;
inthe mean time having sprung up, blew&#xD;
 out the lights,'and firing their revolvers,&#xD;
shifted their positions, so that the Ameri-&#xD;
cans. discharged their pistols' into the&#xD;
space merely where their enemies had&#xD;
stood., Joaquin shot twice -after the&#xD;
lights were extinguished, hitting a man&#xD;
each time, and with his pistol clubbed,&#xD;
troderesolutely for the door., Here he&#xD;
met an Amw-rican, over whose head he&#xD;
shattered his pistol, very nearly killing&#xD;
him on the spot. It happened that at the&#xD;
Same time that the bandits made their&#xD;
egress, a few Americans were also com-&#xD;
ingout, andbefore the two parties could&#xD;
be fairly separated, so as to render it safe&#xD;
to fire, the bold robbers had made their&#xD;
escape.-&#xD;
It is significant to add, that in a; few&#xD;
days after this occurrence, the Mexican&#xD;
informer was found hanging -to a tree,&#xD;
near the highway, his dead body bearing.&#xD;
the marks of a recent terrible scourging.&#xD;
Joaquin was badly wounded by the dis-&#xD;
charge of Prescott's double-barreled shot-&#xD;
gun, and Three-Fingered Jack, who was&#xD;
now continually with hlrp, was engaged-&#xD;
as he laughingly remarked to an acquain-&#xD;

breast.&#xD;
"How it come not to kill him," said&#xD;
he, "the devil only knows., I'm certain&#xD;
it would have done the job for me."&#xD;
But subsequent events will show that&#xD;
Jack himself was equally hard to kill.&#xD;
Prescott lay for a long time in a doubtful&#xD;
state, and Joaquin sent spies daily from&#xD;
his own siek-bed in the woods, to see if&#xD;
there was any prospect of his dying.&#xD;

A description of one or -two scenes&#xD;
which happened oia Bear 'River, about&#xD;
twenty miles from the city of Marysville,.&#xD;
will serve to give an Idea of what be-&#xD;
was about.  This stream heads in the-&#xD;
Sierra Nevada foot-hills, and crossing a&#xD;
broad plain empties into Feather River,.&#xD;
near the town of Nicolaus. It waters a.&#xD;
fine agricultural and grazing region, and&#xD;
housesin the spring of 18A$, as now,.&#xD;
were scattered at intervals of four, five-&#xD;
and six miles along its banks. In one of&#xD;
these hoUses lived an old widow woman.&#xD;
with her son and daughter. These threee.&#xD;
seated in their door on a pleasant even-&#xD;
ing, were surprised, as they lived off the&#xD;
public road, to see four huge fellows ride&#xD;
up, splendidly dressed, and armed to the&#xD;
teeth. One of them had four revolvers-&#xD;
and a bowie.knife. Dismounting, they&#xD;
requested supper.  It was soon got in-&#xD;
readiness by the brisk young lady-and&#xD;
she was as fresh and rosy a creature as&#xD;
ever one had the happiness to see-and.&#xD;
the travelers partook of it most freely; the.&#xD;
fellow with the four revolvers, who, not-&#xD;
withstanding his fierce look, was quite-&#xD;
gentlemanly in his manners, conversing:&#xD;
with her agreeably, as she politelywaited,&#xD;
upon them.    The old woman looked&#xD;
rather suspiciously at the well-dressed&#xD;
eaters, from under her spectacles, but&#xD;
said nothing. As soon as they had fin,&#xD;
ished, Valenzuela, for it was that.worthy&#xD;
and none other, stepped up to where the-&#xD;
young man was sitting, and cocking'a,&#xD;
pistol between his-eyes, asked him if he-&#xD;
had any objection to having the house-&#xD;
robbed; if so, to name it.  The old&#xD;
woman here screamed out:&#xD;
"Oh Lordl Iknowed it; I seed the-&#xD;
cloven foot a stickin' out all the time,"&#xD;
and-continued to cry 'it with such veh'e-&#xD;
mence that they were forced to put:agag&#xD;

a few hundred dollars, the robbers left.&#xD;
At a late hour in the night another&#xD;
house was burst open, and the terrified&#xD;
inmates were dragged outof their beds,&#xD;
and securely bound hand and foot, be-&#xD;
sides being gagged, before they awoke&#xD;
sufficiently to know whether it was a&#xD;
dream or.a reality. There was only one&#xD;
man at the house, the rest were women&#xD;
and children. - All the money and jewel-&#xD;
ry was taken that could be found, and&#xD;
among other things, a gold watch, the&#xD;
chain of which Valenzuela very 'cooly&#xD;
put over his neck.     I&#xD;
"Go to that old woman and take the&#xD;
gag out of her mouth," said he to one&#xD;
of his men, "she looks as if she were&#xD;
choking herself to death in the effort to&#xD;
say something,".&#xD;
As soon as the gag was removed, she&#xD;
begged Valenzuela with many tears, to&#xD;
*give her back the watch, as it was a pres-&#xD;
ent from a dear friend, and contained a&#xD;
precious lock of hair.%&#xD;
,"iCertainly," said the robber, "if that's&#xD;
.the case, I don't want it," and handed it&#xD;
to her.&#xD;
Strange as it may seem at the first&#xD;
glance, the agel widow felt a sentiment&#xD;
of gratitude. towards the robber, who&#xD;
steeped in villany as he was, had soul&#xD;
enough to answer an appeal of this kind.&#xD;
The unfortunate family were found the&#xD;
next morning by their neighbors, still&#xD;
lying upon the floor,boundhand and foot&#xD;

cho. Leaving this place, after a short&#xD;
survey of the neighborhood, he proceed-&#xD;
ed-to the Eagle's Pass, and there came&#xD;
upon a party of Mexicans, who were&#xD;
going, or said so at least, in the Tulares&#xD;
to capture the wild mustangs, which fed&#xD;
there in great numbers. From this point&#xD;
the Rangers divided, a portion going to&#xD;
the Chico Panoche Pass, and the others&#xD;
taking a course through the mountains.&#xD;
They found trails which led both divi-&#xD;
sions to the same point, that is, to the&#xD;
Bayou Seetas, or Little Prairie. Before&#xD;
reaching this point Love stopped a few&#xD;
Mexicans, who were evidently carrying&#xD;
forward the news of his advance into&#xD;
that wild and suspicious region. Sepa-&#xD;
rating again, the company again met at&#xD;
the Grand Panoche' Pass, from which&#xD;
they went on in a body to the Arroyo&#xD;
Cantoova. Here they found theseventy or&#xD;
eighty men, of Joaquin's band, spoken&#xD;
of above, with the fifteen hundred stolen&#xD;
horses. These men, it would be fair to&#xD;
nfer, could have annihilated the small&#xD;
party of twenty men opposed to them,&#xD;
had they seen fit, and it was a wise act&#xD;
in Captain Love to deceive them as he&#xD;
'did, by informing them that he was exe-&#xD;

hunting, in order that a tax might be&#xD;
collected from them.for the privilege, in&#xD;
accordance -yith a late act of the Legis-&#xD;
lature. With this explanation, and&#xD;
going through the farce of taking down&#xD;
a list of their names, which were no doubt'&#xD;
fictitious, every one of them, he started&#xD;
on in the direction of San Juan, but&#xD;
turned about seven or eight miles off, at&#xD;
&#xD;
the head of the Arroyo, in orderto watch&#xD;
f their mbvemenits. It was now the 24th&#xD;
of the month, on the 'morning of which&#xD;

and found it wholly  desertedrlota inan&#xD;
- or horse left. - Fully convinced frm this-&#xD;
sudden abandonment of the plee; that&#xD;
- they were nothing'less than a portion&#xD;
of Joaquin's band, he resolved to follow&#xD;
their trail. On the 2th,"which *as&#xD;
Sunday, at three o'clock in the morning,&#xD;
he reached the Tulare Plains, where he&#xD;
found they had parted their company-&#xD;
some going south towards the Tejon&#xD;
Pass, and others north towards the San&#xD;
Joaquin River. "Detailing a portion of-&#xD;
the Rangers to proceed to Mariposa&#xD;
county with some stolen horses which.&#xD;
had been recovered on the way, the Cap-&#xD;
tain, with the remainder of his party,&#xD;
numbering only eight men, dauntlessly&#xD;
pursued the southern trail, which led&#xD;
in the more proper direction for finding&#xD;
Jfoaquin. Just at daylight he saw a&#xD;
smoke-rising frqm the plains on his left,&#xD;
and wishing to allow no circumstance,&#xD;
however trivial, to pass unnoticed, at a&#xD;
time so much requiring his utmost vigi-&#xD;
lance, he turned from the trail an~d'rode&#xD;
out towards it. He saw nothing more&#xD;
than some loose horses, until within six&#xD;
hundred yards of the spot from which&#xD;
the smoke proceeded, when rising a&#xD;
mound, he discovered seven men scat-&#xD;
tered around a small fire, one of whom&#xD;
was a few steps off, washing a fine look-&#xD;
ing bay horse with water which he held -&#xD;
in a pan. Theii sentinel, who had just&#xD;
been cooking, at thirnoment caught&#xD;
sight of the approaching party, and gave&#xD;
the alarm to his comrades, who all&#xD;
rushed forth in the direction of their hor-&#xD;

He stood still a few moments, turning&#xD;

sinking slowly t qthe ground upon his&#xD;

While their beloved leader was proudly&#xD;
submitting to the inexorable Fate which&#xD;
fell upon him, if we may call it Fate,&#xD;
when it was born from his own extreme&#xD;
carelessness in separating himself from&#xD;

habitual feeling of too much security at&#xD;

'In all directions over the plains.&#xD;

miles before he fell, pierced with niie&#xD;

&#xD;
stumble in the gopher holes;,and soft&#xD;

he would wheel with glaring eyes and&#xD;
with a whoop of defiance, diseharge'his&#xD;
sirhooter. 'Though good shot, oit of&#xD;
five trials he missed every 1tine.-' Cir-&#xD;
cumstances were against :him, but- he&#xD;
was determined never to be taken alive,&#xD;
and to no proposal to surrender would&#xD;
he listen a moment, but rian aon aslong&#xD;
as his strength would: sustain him, and&#xD;
fought till he fell, dying with his hand&#xD;
on, his pistol, which he had emptied of&#xD;
every load but one. He was at last shot&#xD;
through the head by Captain Love, who&#xD;
had wounded him twice before in the&#xD;
long chase. Three-Fingered Jack, anom-&#xD;
alous as it may seem to be, while he was&#xD;
the very incarnatioA of cruelty, was At&#xD;
the same time as brave a man as this&#xD;
world ever has produced,,and so died, as&#xD;
those who killed him will testify.&#xD;
Shortly after the chase of Joaquin and&#xD;
Three-Fingered Jack commenced, three'&#xD;
of the band not before discovered, gal-&#xD;
loped out into the plain from a point a&#xD;
little below Joaquin's camp fire where'&#xD;
they had probably-made a small seeprate&#xD;
encampment the night before, and' dis-&#xD;
mounted in full view of several of the&#xD;
Rangers, who approached them on three&#xD;
sides.  They stood still until within&#xD;
reach of pistol shot, when they suddenly&#xD;
sprang into, their saddles, and firing&#xD;
their revolvers at the approaching Ran-&#xD;
gers, rode off. The Rangers returned'&#xD;
the fire with effect, wounding two of the -&#xD;
men and one of the horses. Their ani-&#xD;
mals being remarkably swift,%they dis-&#xD;
tanced their pursuers, and reached the&#xD;
foot of the mountains without further&#xD;
injury.: But just at this point one'of the&#xD;
wounded men grew so faint that he fell&#xD;

Among the numerous affidavits, iden-&#xD;

take the following as specimens of the&#xD;

who had often confessed wounded mem-&#xD;

Affdavits like these, together witb&#xD;

of hundreds#of visitors at the different&#xD;
exhibitions were more than sufficient to&#xD;
satisfy the legal authorities of the death&#xD;
of, the noted cbieftain. Accordingly the&#xD;
Governor of the State, John Bigler,&#xD;
caused to be paid to Captain Love the&#xD;
sum of one thousand dollars, which in&#xD;
his official capacity he had offered for the&#xD;
capture' of the bandit, dead or alive.&#xD;
And subsequently, on the 15th day of&#xD;
May, 1854, the Legislature of California,&#xD;
considering that his truly valuable ser-&#xD;
vices in ridding the country of so great&#xD;
a terror were not sufficiently rewarded,&#xD;
passed an act granting himan additional&#xD;
sum of five thousand dollars.   I,,-&#xD;
The story is told.  Briefly, and with-&#xD;
.out the aid of ornament, the life and&#xD;
,character of Joaquin Murieta have been&#xD;
sketched.  His career was short, for he&#xD;
died in his twenty-second year; but in&#xD;
the few years which were allowed him&#xD;
he displayed qualities of mind and heart&#xD;
which marked him as an extraordinary&#xD;
man, and leaving his name impressed&#xD;
upon the early history of this State, he&#xD;
also leaves- behind him the important&#xD;
lesson that there is nothing so danger-&#xD;
ous in its consequences as injutic to in.&#xD;
dwiiduala-whether it arise from preja-&#xD;
dice of color or any other source,; that a&#xD;
wrong done to one man is a wrong to&#xD;
society and to the world.&#xD;
It is only necessary to add, that, after&#xD;
the death of its chief, the mighty or-&#xD;
ganization which he had established&#xD;
was broken up. It exists now enly In&#xD;
scattered fragments over California and&#xD;
Mexico. Its subordinate chiefe-awmong&#xD;

existence, they will make themselves&#xD;
felt in nothing more, it is probable, than&#xD;
petty outbreaks here and there, and&#xD;
depredations of such a character as can&#xD;
easily be checked by the vigilance of the&#xD;
laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
Of Rosita, the beautiful and wdl-be-&#xD;
loved of Joaquin, the writer knows no&#xD;
further than that she remains in the&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
As the second greatest bandit of Cal-,&#xD;
ifornia Tiburcio Vasquez will stand on&#xD;
the pages of' the history of our State.&#xD;
It should be remembered that when&#xD;
Joaquin Murietta roamed, robbed and&#xD;
murdered, there was but little law in&#xD;
our State, and the means of arresting&#xD;
and bringing law breakers to Justice&#xD;
were scant and inadequate. On the other&#xD;
hand, the decades that have elapsed be-&#xD;
tween his time and the years 1878 and&#xD;
1874, in which Vasquez committed his&#xD;
greatest depredations, has witnessed the&#xD;
complete organization of the counties of&#xD;
our State under the proper authority of&#xD;
law, police, judges and jury. Hence it&#xD;
is that the exploits and escapes of Vas.&#xD;
quezexcel those of Murietta, in being,&#xD;
performed at far greater hazards, and&#xD;
against greater odds. One thing, however,&#xD;
was greatly in his favor,-as was also the&#xD;
-case with Murietta : in all those, counties&#xD;
where he operated, he had the moral&#xD;
support and physical aid of his country-&#xD;
men, and- especially his countrywomen,&#xD;
the native Californians. There seems to&#xD;
be an ever present hostility of -these la-&#xD;
ter remnants of the early mixed Indian,&#xD;
and Mexican stock that roamed the hills,&#xD;
cafions, and all the valleys of California;&#xD;
- who owned the mighty bands of wealth-&#xD;
,producing cattle, and whose hospitality.&#xD;
was ever generous to the stranger knock-&#xD;
ing at the gates of their haciendas.&#xD;
.The bitterness and hate engendered by&#xD;
&#xD;
the Mexican War, is as strong as when&#xD;
General Scott entered the walls of the&#xD;
City of Mexico, and Commodore Stock-&#xD;
ton's flag of conquest was raised in the&#xD;
bay of Monterey. The .influx that' fol-&#xD;
lowed the announcement of the discov-&#xD;
ery of gold, bringing with it new energy,&#xD;
industry and progress, but.also vice,&#xD;
crime and outlawry, spreading in every&#xD;
direction, the evil being felt a thousand'&#xD;
times more exquisitely than the good&#xD;
among the quiet loving and indolent Na-&#xD;
tive Californians, served to intensify the&#xD;
original feeling of dislike and distaste to&#xD;
everything American, and caused them-&#xD;
to view with sympathy-and to lend prac-&#xD;
tical aid to any man of their own lan-&#xD;
guage, who madeas his prey the hated&#xD;
interlopers. With ideas of right and&#xD;
wrong mixed and sadly confused, wheth-&#xD;
er he, to whom they granted comfort and&#xD;
assistance, was a ,bandit. or a patriot,&#xD;
was of small consequence. Of course in&#xD;
the higher degrees of the Native Cali-&#xD;
fornian social order, this feeling was&#xD;
not shared, but in the grand-majority of&#xD;
thesp people who were of the poorer and&#xD;
less thinking class the feeling was of the&#xD;
strongest in favor of such men as Muri-&#xD;
etta and Vasquez. For , this particular&#xD;
reason alone, and not taking into con4id-&#xD;
eration any other, it may be understood&#xD;
how for so long a period in the heart of&#xD;
civilization, Vasquez was enabled to set&#xD;
the laws of God and men at, defiance.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIBURCIO VASQUEZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7584-00000045"/>&#xD;
Timurcio VASQUEZ&#xD;
was born August 11, 1889, in Monterey,&#xD;
perhaps the most thoroughly Mexican&#xD;
town in appearance, the ways of its in-&#xD;
habitants, its changes, vicissitudes and&#xD;
its religious tone, in California, and is&#xD;
now, at the date of his capture, after a&#xD;
noteworthy career of murder and pillage,&#xD;
35 yeaixs of age. - His parents are both&#xD;
dead, several of his brothers and sisters&#xD;
are still living, one brother residing near&#xD;
Monterey, and another in the vicinity of&#xD;
Hernandez Valley in San Benito County,&#xD;
and one brother lives in Los Angeles Co.&#xD;
Of his two, sisters, both are married;&#xD;
one lives at San Juan Baptista, Monterey&#xD;
County, and the other at the New Idria&#xD;
Quicksilver mines.   Vasquez, when&#xD;
youig, is said to have been unusually&#xD;
bright, intelligent and smart for his&#xD;
years. He went to school and received&#xD;
a fair English education, which he con-&#xD;
tinued to cultivate and improve in later&#xD;
years. As a man he possessed more&#xD;
than an average command of the Eng-&#xD;
ish language, while his handwriting&#xD;
was'beautiful. - His parents were people&#xD;
in ordinary circumstances, owning a&#xD;
small tract of land and always had&#xD;
enough for their wants.&#xD;
The appearance of Vasquez, as he&#xD;
laid In' the Jail at Los Angeles on&#xD;
May   fifteenth, the  day  after  his&#xD;
capture, was that of- a man -with&#xD;
nothing of the red-handed and fe-&#xD;
rocious brigand demeanor that his repu-&#xD;
tation has given him. He is a man of&#xD;
about medium stature, with a well knit,&#xD;
wiry figure. He does not weigh over&#xD;
140 or 150pounds. His complexion is&#xD;
much lighter than the ordinary Mexican&#xD;
His features are clear cdt, with an intelli-&#xD;
gent expression. His eyes are rather&#xD;
large and of a light gray or blue color.&#xD;
His forehead is high and his head well&#xD;
shaped. In manner he is frank and earn-&#xD;
est, with no disposition to make him-&#xD;
self a hero His general demeanor is&#xD;
that of a quiet inoffensive man; and but&#xD;
&#xD;
for his calm, steady eye, which stamps&#xD;
him as a man 9f firmness and great de-&#xD;
termination, no one would take him for&#xD;
the terrible Tiburcio Vasquez. To show.&#xD;
how diverselytwo men, different persons,&#xD;
will describe a third, we give the follow-&#xD;
ing description of Vasquez, furnished to&#xD;
a San Francisco journal from official&#xD;
sources:&#xD;
A low forehead, and a head of coarse&#xD;
black hair are little indications of intel-&#xD;
ligence, and from beneath a coarse, over-&#xD;
hanging brow gleam two deep-set,.&#xD;
treacherous, cunning eyes, of which even&#xD;
a Madagascar cat would be ashamed.&#xD;
The whole-contour of his fAce suggests-&#xD;
Indian blood; his cheek bones are high,&#xD;
his mouth large and coarse,~his beard&#xD;
and mustache (and the latter extends far&#xD;

5 feet 51 inches high, and is of good fig-&#xD;
ure, proportionately, but with large&#xD;
hands--an unusual feature in those of&#xD;
Spanish blood. Like all of his class, he is&#xD;
fond of finely and ostentatious display ;&#xD;
vain to an extreme, and 4 thorough bully.&#xD;
Perhaps the best description of the ban&#xD;
dit would be one which would strike the&#xD;
golden mean between the. two above-&#xD;

though considered very reckless and un-&#xD;
principled, he had never committed an act&#xD;
which could bring him within the pale&#xD;
of justice. But at this period of his ex-&#xD;
istence an episode occurred which show-&#xD;
ed the natural bent of his inclination.&#xD;
HIS FIRST EXPLOIT.&#xD;
This was in the year1854. . One night&#xD;
Tiburcio attended a fandango. Insthose-&#xD;
times scenes of bloodshed at these gath.&#xD;

difficulty occurred between Vasquez and&#xD;
another Californian about one of -the&#xD;

After Andon Leiva had delivered hin.&#xD;

concerning tho whereabouts of Vasquez's&#xD;
gang, that resulted a week after, in the&#xD;
arrest of Teodoro Moreno, near Hon; E.,&#xD;
C. Tully's ranch, forty-five miles south-&#xD;
east of Hollister. Marshal Orsen Lyon,&#xD;
of Hollister, was the arresting officer.&#xD;
Moreno was tried at Salinas City, found&#xD;
guilty of murder in the second degree,&#xD;

CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE&#xD;
Was exercised by the Sheriffs of five or&#xD;
ix counties with a view to the capture&#xD;
Df Vasquez, but without avail.  Several&#xD;
expeditions went to the New Idria mines&#xD;
ind other points, to hunt him, but always&#xD;
found that he had been notified of their&#xD;
coming and had fled. It seems certain&#xD;
hat he kept informed of the movements&#xD;
f the officers by native. Californians,&#xD;
wherever he went, and it is, even believ-&#xD;
id that some of the white settlers in the&#xD;
southern section of the State aided him&#xD;
his avoidance of pursuit. He was,&#xD;

HOW  THE BANDIT CAME TO BE SUR-&#xD;
PRISED.&#xD;
&#xD;
The following report of an interview&#xD;
between Vasquez and a reporter explains&#xD;
how it was that the Sheriff's party sur-&#xD;
prised him.&#xD;
Reporter-How was it that you were&#xD;
so unprepared for a fight yesterday.?&#xD;
Vaquez-I had just taken of my re-&#xD;
volfers and set my rifle down to go into&#xD;
the kitChen and get some dinner, when&#xD;
thefirst alarm came. I had no time for&#xD;
arhing myself. I saw the wagon com-&#xD;
ing up the road, but didn't pay any at-&#xD;
ttntion to it. At no time before since&#xD;
the -Repetto affitir have I been unprepar-&#xD;
ed to-fight. I have robbed for twenty&#xD;
Ydais, but I have never killed anybody,&#xD;
and Ithink they might have given me a&#xD;
show. 'I tied up twenty men at Coyote&#xD;
Holes, and though aman shot and wound-&#xD;
ed Ie there, I did not take his life,&#xD;
though I might have done it easily, for&#xD;
I had hin completely at my mercy. I&#xD;
regret.beingtaken in this way, for I al-&#xD;
ways expected to sell my life dearly.&#xD;
New, Isup'ose, I will behung up like a&#xD;
dbg."&#xD;
At this'point Vasquez intimated that&#xD;
he was tired, and the interview termin-&#xD;
ated.&#xD;
&#xD;
ADDITIONAL PARTICULAES5 O  TRE OAPWI&#xD;
I findon conferfing with diferentiem-,&#xD;
bere of our party today, that after I was;&#xD;
posted at the northeast corner of the-&#xD;
house, larris, Hartley, Johnston and Bry-&#xD;
ant pa#ed around the eist corner of the-&#xD;
house. Hartis, looking across the an&#xD;
gle, saw a man sitting at the-table in- the-&#xD;
little kitchen. Harris, Hartley And John-&#xD;
ston, reached the door fifst, and the wo-&#xD;
man, discovering their approach, sprang;&#xD;
toward the door with outstretched hande&#xD;
and attempted to close it. Harris pried&#xD;
it open with the muzzle of his gun in'&#xD;
time to see Vasquez go flying through&#xD;
the narrow opening in the south end of'&#xD;
the wing, and instantly fire. 'The four&#xD;
men sprang around the end of the build-&#xD;
ing and caught sight of the astonished,&#xD;
outlaw at nearly the same moment that&#xD;
he sprang toward his horse, only to find&#xD;
himself confronted by me. At the same.&#xD;
instant Rogers sprang upon him from&#xD;
the west. The firing was simultaneous.&#xD;
He threw up his hands, exclaiming.&#xD;
"Don't shoot ; you needn't shoot; you've.&#xD;
got me." He was perfectly collected, and&#xD;
was never on his' knees for an instant,---.&#xD;
nor knocked down.   Harris said, "come&#xD;
along, then," and started at once with&#xD;
the party around the building. On the,&#xD;
way he repeated, "You boys have got.&#xD;
me; my name is Alejandro 'Martinez.""&#xD;
Johnston said, "I have had your photo-&#xD;
graph for years, and know you to be Ti--&#xD;
buicio Vasquez."&#xD;

STAUNCHING THE BANDIT'S WOUNDS.&#xD;
After examining his wounds, at John-&#xD;
ston's direction, the woman came to the.&#xD;
wounded man's succor. Johnstoa pro.&#xD;
cured a rope and tied Lebardo to a pest&#xD;
and then entered the house, took the -&#xD;
dagger from the floor and with it ripped'k&#xD;
a sheet from the bed and hastily prepared.&#xD;
some bandages and helped the wo-&#xD;
man to bind up the bandit's wounds.&#xD;
While the house was being searched,.&#xD;

ing his previous declarations that he was&#xD;
innocent of'murder, and claiming that,,&#xD;
if a fairtrial were given him, he could&#xD;
notbe- condemned' to -any punishment&#xD;
more severe than imprisonment.&#xD;
TAkEN TO MONTEREY.&#xD;
Sheriff Smith, of Monterey, arrived-&#xD;
the same'dayj a to him Sheriff Row-&#xD;
leind"turned 64er his prisoner. Next&#xD;
day, after ironingthe biditveryheavily,&#xD;
heriff Snith started with him, by the,&#xD;
route 6f the Southern Pacific Railroad,&#xD;
'foriMonterey." It Wafeared that there&#xD;
night ean attempt to lynch the prison-&#xD;
i at dome,'point on' the way; and a&#xD;
guard enfileitly strong to resist any&#xD;
suchaitta'ke accopanied the Sheriff. No&#xD;
efroft of the kind was made, however,&#xD;
andthe party reached in'safety Salinas&#xD;
City; the county seat of Monterey, where&#xD;
the prisonerr was lodged in the county&#xD;
jail.. There, ironed securely and closely&#xD;
watched and guarded, he has since re-&#xD;
mained. In his, trial, which will soon&#xD;
take place, he will be defended by P. B.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tully, Eq., of Hollister, and Charles&#xD;
Ben Darwin, Esq.. of San Fraciso.&#xD;
The prosecution will be conducted by&#xD;
John LordLove, Attorney-g6neral of the&#xD;
State, assisted 1y the District Attorney&#xD;
of Monterey County. Vasquez' counsel&#xD;
hope to save him from the gallows,&#xD;
owing to the difficulty of fastening upon&#xD;
him the direct responsibility for the mur-&#xD;
ders committed during his raids.&#xD;
HIS FATE.&#xD;
His fate will probably be determined&#xD;
before this account is in the .hands of&#xD;
the reader-the trial is set for the 20th&#xD;
,of July-but whether:the great bandit&#xD;
be executed or only imprisoned, the peo-&#xD;
ple -of Southern California will feel that&#xD;
they owe a debt of gratitude to the ener-&#xD;
getic sheriNf who-tracked him to his lair,&#xD;
and rid the highways of a desperado who&#xD;
did not ,confie himself to taking the&#xD;
property of his victims, but wantonly&#xD;
sacrificed life when there was not even&#xD;
the excuse that his own person was in&#xD;
danger. ,,The sherifffi  undertook the&#xD;
work of capturing the outlaw when the&#xD;
amount of the reward would not balf&#xD;
compensate them for the outlays they&#xD;
were obliged' to make-they devoted&#xD;
weeks of time,suffered many privations,&#xD;
ran great risks of 'losing their lives, and&#xD;
succeeded in making prisoner a bandit&#xD;
whose crimes parallel those of Joaquin&#xD;
Murieta,&#xD;
The'murders at Tres Pinos cry for&#xD;
vengeance, and it is to be hoped that the&#xD;
law cannot be so tortured as to protect&#xD;
the ruffian who is manifestly guilty of&#xD;
crimes which should long ago have&#xD;
consigned him to the gallows. His end-&#xD;
ing should 4be such as to deter other&#xD;
aspirants for reputation as highwaymen,&#xD;
and in this respect it is better that Vas-&#xD;
quez should have been taken prisoner&#xD;
than to have been killed in the en-&#xD;
counter. There is little romance in&#xD;
dropping from a scaffold with a 'rope&#xD;
around the neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
