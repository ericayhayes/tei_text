CHAPTER III.&#xD;
Not many miles from the camp of the Li-&#xD;
pans, at the very hour when Lagona so gal-&#xD;
lantv hore their intended victim  awauv, an&#xD;
armed furee of the must: gallant aind desperate&#xD;
mien in the known world-the far-fanTexm'  l'uaan&#xD;
Bangers-was riding slowly over the prairie&#xD;
slowvm, for their horses seemed jaded with&#xD;
long nud hard travel ; and most of tleemn--ex-.&#xD;
cejiting only a few led favorites belonging to&#xD;
the otilcers, anid kept for en hour of need-&#xD;
could scarcely be spurred out of a walk.&#xD;
At the ht a of the pariy, beside him who&#xD;
seemed to be the leader, rode an old nuns,&#xD;
whose face exp dressed great sorrow and a look&#xD;
of despai'inghgony. By his dress he did not&#xD;
seem to belong to the Rangers-for they were&#xD;
rudely uniformed, and splendidly armed with&#xD;
rifles and Colt's incomparable revolvers, as&#xD;
well as heavy Bowie-knives. But he was in the&#xD;
dress -Vsually worn by our opulent Southern&#xD;
planters, and carried a i.audsomely-mounted&#xD;
doubule-barreled  fowing-piece - a  weapon&#xD;
which would be utte-iy useless in savage com&#xD;
bat, except at very close quarters.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE COMMCHE'S DREAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
I er that we must encamp at yonder&#xD;
grove !" said the leader to the person last de-&#xD;
sceibed. " There is water and timber there,&#xD;
and our horses are fairly run down."&#xD;
And ii pointed to a belt of timber in the&#xD;
distance, which rose on the banks of one o&#xD;
the branches of the San Saba.&#xD;
-.Oh, for Ieaven's sake! don't talk of stop-&#xD;
ping until we fiud my 1)00r Stella. Major Ben&#xD;
said the later to tie' chief of the Rangers.&#xD;
- My de' Mr. Delorme, I would not if it&#xD;
were Iosie for the men to keep on !" said&#xD;
the oteer, with feeling. " But our horses are&#xD;
so used up by this rapid and continued march,&#xD;
that if we were to overhaul the Indians, they&#xD;
could with ease escape us. By the signs&#xD;
which have freshened every hour to-day, we&#xD;
are ieenr then, ane ought to be in trim for a&#xD;

" What ! with only seventy men !"&#xD;
"cThe Rangi's never count their foes until&#xD;
they stop to take their scalps !" said the Ma-&#xD;
Jor, quietly.&#xD;
"FMajor McCullough, there is something&#xD;
C i um rik n over there to the son'-east !" said&#xD;
iii 'old I!niger, who hid been scouting a few&#xD;
hudired yards in advance, and had drawn up&#xD;

At lait lie n;niu aked the major what lie&#xD;
saw.                                     -&#xD;
" Two persons riding at full speed, and fol-&#xD;
loned far behind by a crowd, judging from&#xD;
the du-t they kick up !" answered the latter.&#xD;
Are they pursued Indians ?"&#xD;
"One is-the other is dressed in white, and&#xD;
&#xD;
looks like a woman ; but they both ride as&#xD;
swift as lightningf"&#xD;
"My heart tells me that it is my Stella I"&#xD;
cried Mr, Delorme ; and he madly spurred&#xD;
his jaded horse, and tried to urge hiint onward.&#xD;
But the horse, too tired to make even an&#xD;
effort, stood with drooping head, and bore the&#xD;
galling spur without flinching.&#xD;
"Tape a fresh horse,  r. Delorree ,xwe will&#xD;
soon see into the matterI" said the major,&#xD;
kindly.&#xD;
The led horses--seven or eight in number-&#xD;
were now brought up; and the major mounting&#xD;
one, assigned another to the planter, and the&#xD;
rest to the most experienced and daring of his&#xD;
followers.&#xD;
Then, aft: r having given directions to those&#xD;
who were to remain behind to repare for bat-&#xD;
tle, he led the way toward the persons vhon&#xD;
he had seen, at full speed. But fast as he rode,&#xD;
the planter kept close by his side, and the rest&#xD;
of his men kept well up.&#xD;
As they neared the objects ahead, they&#xD;
could plainly see that the two nearest them&#xD;
were pursued by a large body beyond. The&#xD;
former, when the major's party were first dis-&#xD;
covered, halted for a moment, as if they feared&#xD;
new foes in their path ; but their stop was only&#xD;
mtoieentary: they were soon in motion again,&#xD;
and did not alter their course, which led di-&#xD;
rectly toward the Rangers.&#xD;
And the speed of those who went and those&#xD;
who came, soon brought the parties close to-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;
Thank Heaven, it is my child i" sliouted&#xD;
the planter, at last, as he recognized her who&#xD;
rode the coal-black steed, and who also, know&#xD;
ing him, now waved her hand in recognition.&#xD;
"I[ wonder what the deuce that wild Co.&#xD;
mance' is doing with her 2 He ie a deadly&#xD;
foe to us-or his tribe is. This is some new&#xD;
freak" muttered Major Ben, as ha checked&#xD;
the speed of his horse.&#xD;
A imoment more, and-Lagona-who had till&#xD;
now held the rein of the fiery horse upon&#xD;
which the rescued captive rode, checked it&#xD;
and his own, in the'eirele made by the halting&#xD;
Rangers.&#xD;
"Stella-my darlingchild!" cried the plant-&#xD;
er, as he threw himself from his horse and&#xD;
clasped his daughter to his heaving breast.&#xD;
" Safe, my fiatheer, safe !" she sobbed, as she&#xD;
returned his embrace.&#xD;
" What tribe are those that follow Y" asked&#xD;
the major of Lagona, who sat still as a statue&#xD;
upon his panting horse.&#xD;
" Lipans I They want the scalp of the&#xD;
white-flower, whom I took from them when&#xD;
they were ready to burn her !" said Lagona,&#xD;
quietly.&#xD;
"By Heavens you're a trump, if you are a&#xD;
Comanche :" said the major, warmly, extend.&#xD;
ing his hand,whichthe young chiefdid not take&#xD;
"Too proud to shake hands with an old&#xD;

CII APTim IV.&#xD;
It was nearly night. The Rangers had made&#xD;
their camp upon the branch of the San Saba&#xD;
before spoken of, in the commencement of the&#xD;
last chapter.' And it was well they had so&#xD;
good a camping-place, for they sorely needed&#xD;
4    rest.  -&#xD;
Some of them were bathing their tired limbs&#xD;
in the clear waters of the little stream; others&#xD;
were cooking food at their cheerful camp-&#xD;
fires ; still other were guarding the horses,&#xD;
which were cropping the luxuriant and tender&#xD;
grass by the water-side.&#xD;
But a central group, standing beneath the&#xD;
wide-spreading limbs of a huge tree, demands&#xD;
our imunediate attention.&#xD;
It consisted of Major McCullough; the&#xD;
planter, Mr. Delorme, his daughter Steila, and&#xD;
agona, the young Comanche chief.&#xD;
Near the latter, needing no restraint-for&#xD;
they would not leave their master--stood his&#xD;
two horses.&#xD;
And never did man look more noble than&#xD;
he, as he stoo l there, with his arms folded&#xD;
across his chest-his tall form as erect as the&#xD;
lance which lane d his shoulder-his look more&#xD;
proud and fearless than ever an emperor dared&#xD;
to wear.                              '&#xD;
"Noble chief! twice you have saved my&#xD;
daughter's life, at the risk of your own !" said&#xD;
Delorme, who had been.told by Stela of her&#xD;
rescue from the stake. "I do not know how&#xD;
to reward you sufilciently. Here is gold-all&#xD;
that I have with me. If you will come to&#xD;
Bolsa de Flores, my plantation on the Guada-&#xD;
loupe, I will give you more."&#xD;
"The Comauche despises gold!r" said La-&#xD;
gona, contemptuously, pushing back the heavy&#xD;
purse which the planter offered to him.&#xD;
" Accept, at least, my watch and gun : the&#xD;
one will tell you tihe time-the other wI de-&#xD;
fend you from the foe."&#xD;
" The sun is my time-keeper  I have wea-&#xD;
pons of my own !" said Lagona, in the same&#xD;
proud tone.&#xD;
"What can I give you-how reward your&#xD;
bravery ?" aked the grateful father.&#xD;
The eye of Lagonatested for a moment up-&#xD;
on Stella. She looked very, very beautiful,&#xD;
and hr blue eyes were fixed upon him with a&#xD;
look of intense gratitude. What wonder that&#xD;
he, all untutored in the " art of love"-for&#xD;
art it Seems to be, alas ! too much-what won-&#xD;
der, I say, that he should mistake that grate-&#xD;
ful look for an expression of love. He did ;&#xD;
and pointing to her, looked Delorme full in&#xD;
the face, and said&#xD;
"I plucked the white-flower from the fire&#xD;
for myself. Give her to me!&#xD;
The plnterlokled aghast. had the Indian&#xD;
asked for half- ay, all -of his estate, he&#xD;
would not hive been more astonished.&#xD;
" What !" he gasped--" give my Stella, my&#xD;
angel child, toa savage-to a wild Indian ?" t&#xD;
"Are you better than the Great Spirit ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
said Lagona, haughtily. "In a dream, III&#xD;
gave her to me- -bade me go and save her,&#xD;
and take her to my breast. I have done so,&#xD;
and she must-he mine!"&#xD;
"Dreams always go by contraries, my&#xD;
young buck !" said the major, quietly. "You&#xD;
had better take the gentleman's presents, and&#xD;
go back to your tribe again."&#xD;
"You are a fool! 'You have a squaw's'&#xD;
tongue--keep it between your teeth t" replied&#xD;
Lagona, bitterly.&#xD;
The blood rushed up into the face of Mc-&#xD;
Cullough, and his hand sought the hilt of his&#xD;
knife in an instant. Stella saw that the storm&#xD;
of his fiery passion was about to break forth,&#xD;
and besought him not to be angry with the&#xD;
the man who had saved her life.&#xD;
"I will do your will, lady," said the Ranger;&#xD;
"but more than one red-skin has eaten dirt&#xD;
for saying less to Ben McCullough than he&#xD;
did !&#xD;
"The white-flower need not speak for La-&#xD;
gona. He is a brave, and does not fear the&#xD;
pale-face chief. But he loves the white-flower,&#xD;
and would make her his wife. Lagona is a&#xD;
great chief 1 A, thousand braves conic when&#xD;
he calls ! Let the white-flower speak !'' said&#xD;
the Comanche.&#xD;
"She must go home with her father 1" said&#xD;
Stella, shrinking from the bold and demanding&#xD;
look of Lagona. "Let the chief accept our&#xD;
presents, and return to his tribe, where many&#xD;
a maid will be proud to accept his love."&#xD;
" Lagona will not go! The Great Spirit&#xD;
has spoken, and the white-flower shall be his !"&#xD;
cried the Indian, vehemently.&#xD;
"Look ye here, Mr. Lagona-if that's your&#xD;
name-you'd better sing in a lower key in this&#xD;
camp !" said the major, exhibiting unequivo-&#xD;
cal signs of anger. "You have done his&#xD;
gentleman a favor, and he has offered to  ay&#xD;
you for it, like a man. You refuse his pres-&#xD;
sents, and ask what is not only unnatural, but&#xD;
im possible ! And now you begin to put on&#xD;
airs, and make threats! You've got to draw&#xD;
rein, and stop just where you are, or we'll have&#xD;
to teach you a lesson of patience !"&#xD;
The young Comanche turned, and if looks&#xD;
could have smitten a man down, would have&#xD;
blasted McCullough where lie stood. But the&#xD;
latter had faced angry Indians before ; and he&#xD;
smiled bitterly, as he said&#xD;
"You can't scare me by making faces. If&#xD;
you don't know how to behave yourself bet-&#xD;
ter, leave !"&#xD;
And he pointed to the horses of the young&#xD;
chief.&#xD;
" Lagona will go, but lie will come again;&#xD;
and lie will not coni alone! He has spoken!&#xD;
The white-flower shall be his !" cried the Co-&#xD;
nmanche, as he called to his horse, which bound-&#xD;
ed to his side.&#xD;
"He has spoken a lie I The white-ffower&#xD;
will never grow on red dirt l' said the major,&#xD;
scornfully.&#xD;

THE COMANCHE'S DREAM.                11&#xD;
&#xD;
sat upon ever face wi In its walls, except&#xD;
two ; fr the life of the homestead, the angel of&#xD;
the domain, was missing. While on a ride&#xD;
with her father and a few friends, Stella Do-&#xD;
lorme had been borne away by a band of red&#xD;
marauders, andl several of those who bravely&#xD;
fought to save her had been killed in the at-&#xD;
tempt, and the remainder, with her father (who&#xD;
had fought with desperation), had been driven&#xD;
back. limt he knew no rest until, giving the&#xD;
alarma to the gallant Rangers, he with them&#xD;
started in pursuit of the dreaded and hated&#xD;
abductors.&#xD;
Two there were, I said, within that dwelling&#xD;
whose factes were not clouded for the loss of&#xD;
Stella. tOne was the wife of Mr. Ovarian Dc-&#xD;
lormie, t hugh not the mother of Stella--for he&#xD;
had liukd liiiself oi' a second marriage to a&#xD;
fashionable lady, artificially good-looking, and&#xD;
possessed of many filmsy/supe/rticialities and&#xD;
aceomphisliiunts i;but never a trace of a heart&#xD;
co bhie found about her. And though when&#xD;
Mr. )lorlmi  w as present, she professed a very&#xD;
sincere, in truth, a very passionate attachment&#xD;
for Stelli, she hated her from the bottom of&#xD;
her soul--if she had one. But Mr. Delorme's&#xD;
wealth was her ambition-that for which she&#xD;
married him, and would at any time, have en-&#xD;
Coiiimassed his death.&#xD;
0 Money !-what a thrice-accursed fiend it&#xD;
is-how ofteii dois it trample down every holy&#xD;
gnarl of ie affections&#xD;
The ether, wio'wore no shadow of gloom&#xD;
1iuoi his lace, was her nephew--or at least he&#xD;
was suppliosedl to be-one Paul Malerson, a wild&#xD;
and disi tated young man, whom she had kept&#xD;
ever under her' especial protection, and who,&#xD;

was not avamy-a s fretuently he was--en a&#xD;

But wien at the plantation, his conduct was&#xD;

" Wel, Aunt Ifattic," said lie, after Mrs.&#xD;

eurred, "what is this to me? Mhs Stella is&#xD;
probably scalped, or else the unwilling bride&#xD;

Perhaps not-the Rangers may rescue her;&#xD;
and if so, it would be a pity that you were not&#xD;
at hand to be the hero of the affair. As it is, let&#xD;
me advise you to hasten and collect a few men&#xD;
and yourself set out, as if you felt some anxi-&#xD;
ety in the matter. If she is rescued, this act&#xD;
will show favorably on you  part: if she is&#xD;
iot, why Mr. Delorme, when he returns, will he&#xD;
pleased with your zeal; and if she is lost, will&#xD;
be very apt to make you his heir.' -You can&#xD;
lose nothing at any rate."&#xD;
"But my scalp! if the red devils happen&#xD;
still to be lurkiug round 1"&#xD;
"There is no danger of their being in the&#xD;
vicinity when the Rangers are out!1" replied&#xD;
Mrs. Delorme.&#xD;
"Yell, my good aunt, I suppose I must&#xD;
even do your bidding. You have managed&#xD;
well for me heretofore, and it is best that I fol-&#xD;
low your guidance."&#xD;
The conversation was now arrested by the&#xD;
sound of glad shouts outside ; and both aunt&#xD;
and nephew rushed to the nearest window to&#xD;
see what occasioned them.&#xD;
"Upon my life, they have recovered her-&#xD;
see, it is Delorme himself riding with her at&#xD;
the head of the Rangers. Oh! if they had&#xD;
only been an hour later, and you had met them&#xD;
with your band, what an effect it would have&#xD;
had 1 But run down, my good Paul, and tell&#xD;
them what you were going to do ; atid if they&#xD;

"Jupiter! what a manager you are, Aunt&#xD;

the apartment.&#xD;
I a few moments after, Mr. Delorme enter-&#xD;
ed the room, accompanied by his daughter,&#xD;
and was met by Mrs. D. with a burst of hys-&#xD;
terieal joy that/was very affecting. Iler hair&#xD;
was all en ndglig , her eyes as red as if she had&#xD;
heen weeping oceans of tears, instead of merely&#xD;
rubbing them, and her air that of one who had&#xD;
suffered intense mental agony.&#xD;
"Ohs! thank gracious heaven ! you are re-&#xD;
turned in safety !" she screamed, as she threw&#xD;
her arms around Stella. " I have nearly died&#xD;
with terror, and Paul was going to rescue you&#xD;
or die !"&#xD;
And then Mrs. Delorme made a successful&#xD;
attempt to faint fashionably, which gave; Mr.&#xD;
Delorme and his daughter more trouble than&#xD;
a reception less hypocritical would have clone&#xD;
W hat shall We do ?-she has fainted away !"&#xD;
cried Mr. Delorme, as he lifted her from the&#xD;
floor, and bore her to a ofta.&#xD;
"Tickle her under the nose with a feather,"&#xD;
said a rough-looking man, with dirty apparel,&#xD;
grizzly beard, and matted hair, and a look any-&#xD;
thing but prepossessing, who, accompanied by&#xD;
Paul Malerson, had followed Mr. Delorme into&#xD;
the room, though till then unobserved by him.&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
It was a terrible scene--a fearful battle-&#xD;
and atl the more horrible because it was&#xD;
waged, not by the red men against their natu-&#xD;
ral enemies,'the pale faces, but by bruthei'&#xD;
againet brother---the Lipan against the Co-&#xD;
inanehle,&#xD;
There, in ilie wild niountain-gorge of the&#xD;
Charrate, where Bust we saw them in their&#xD;
euani, the hland of (Neiehaha and Lagona had&#xD;
btii attacked by Ihi veng ful Liipns, who&#xD;
songhlt preparation for the rough usage which&#xD;
they hed received at t-he hands of Lagmiona-and&#xD;
his teilporiiary allies, the Rnigers. And from&#xD;
early hanii, until the nists o evenin  were&#xD;
gatlieriiig, they had fought with desperation&#xD;
---siiuces carvingg from side to side-and hald&#xD;
tlei' wea pos been s gladly as their hate, one&#xD;
or oter of fll         i two parties, or both, would&#xD;
hav   been (Xtermiinated ; even as it was, a&#xD;
Ifitfl intilglier occurred. Nemielhliha was&#xD;
utr mcei  dwi, never to rise -many of his&#xD;
hravest f lowers fell by his side. But the&#xD;
ip ans ustiered even more than the Coian-&#xD;
cein s  Lwouua iicver bef rc had so daringly&#xD;
ditst~iui shied himself. Ie seemed to court&#xD;
1ea i all the tiimie ; but the grin monarch&#xD;
only threw victims in his way.  is belt was&#xD;
&#xD;
strung all around with scalps ;his quiver,&#xD;
filled again and again with the arrows of the&#xD;
slain, was as often emptied ; his lance and&#xD;
war-club were red from point to butt; NM&#xD;
arm was weary with striking.&#xD;
And when old Lazaro, the brave chief of the&#xD;
Lipins, cried out at the hour of sunset for a&#xD;
truce, both parties were glad to rest.&#xD;
I Why should we war about a woman ?" the&#xD;
old man cried. " We are fools, and have for-&#xD;
gotten wisdom! I have lost moy son by the.&#xD;
hands of Lagona: he-has gone to the happy&#xD;
hunting-grounds, and I cannot call him baic.&#xD;
But I will not mourn for-him. Let us eight&#xD;
no more. I have a daughter who is a star in&#xD;
the sky of beauty. Let Lagona take Agar,&#xD;
my child, and be'a s :n to moe in the place of&#xD;
Pekito. I am a withered tree; I shall soon&#xD;
fall down, and be seen 1o more ; and he shall&#xD;
be chief over all-for we are brothers. We&#xD;
should know no enemies but the pale-faces,&#xD;
who have robbed us of our lands, and have&#xD;
trodden the bones of our fabbers into dust!I"&#xD;
The old chief paused, and east dowta his&#xD;
shield and war-club-a sign that lie would&#xD;
fight no more. And an indian would scorn&#xD;
to strike an unarmed foe ; such treachery is&#xD;
left for the pale-faces!&#xD;
Lagona threw down his weapons. and said:&#xD;
"We are brothers, and will light no more.&#xD;
We have been fools, and Lagona has been the&#xD;
biggest fool of all. His eves are open, and he&#xD;
looks through tears ; for lie sees his dead&#xD;
father and many braves who will light no&#xD;
niore - both the Comanche amid the Lipan.&#xD;
Blood has run like water ; but it has been our&#xD;
own.   The pale-faces were the first cause.&#xD;
Blood calls for blood! It must flow from&#xD;
their veins. Laigcna cannot yet look Agar&#xD;
the beautiful in the face, for his hand is red&#xD;
with the blood of Pekito. But Lagona will&#xD;
lend the warriors into the land of the pale-&#xD;
fices, aid they will take many scalps, and&#xD;
much plunder, aid many captives. Lagona&#xD;
will never raise his hand against a brother&#xD;
more, but lie will fight the pale-faces. Whc&#xD;
will follow where he dares to lead ?'&#xD;
A uiinivemsal shout of applause followed this&#xD;
speech of the young chief; and alt of the&#xD;
braves declared their readiness to go wherever&#xD;
he led.&#xD;
Then the old chief Lazaro anid Lagona clasp-&#xD;
ed hands ; and they, who had lately fought&#xD;
with such fierce desperation, - moved to a&#xD;
bloodless amping-place, andu ate ani smoked&#xD;
together with as much friendship amid good-&#xD;
feeling as if they never had fought each other.&#xD;
And that iiighit-delaying to bury their&#xD;
dead until another day, and altogether omit.&#xD;
ting the scalp--dance which usually follows a&#xD;
battle---they laid their plais for an offensive&#xD;
foray into the frontier settlements of Texas.&#xD;
Lagona was to lead the expedition, and to&#xD;
take a chosen band of picked lwarriors, of both&#xD;
tribes, numbering five hundred or more.&#xD;

THE COMANCH&#xD;
said Paul. "They are wild, and will raise&#xD;
mischief amongst them."&#xD;
The scene iowv, though terrible, was inde-&#xD;
scribably grand. The out-buildings, sugar-&#xD;
houses, and store-house were all in flames, and&#xD;
threw a light as clear as day upon all within&#xD;
the great inelosure. Ialf-naked savages run-&#xD;
ning here and there; horses and cattle, mad-&#xD;
dened with fear, rushing and plunging about,&#xD;
bellowing and neighing ; the Indians yelling&#xD;
and screaming, and the rattling fire from Ma-&#xD;
whoney's irregulars in the house--all combined&#xD;
to effect a terrific Picture.&#xD;
And those who were in the little tower&#xD;
gazed upon it until they were aroused from&#xD;
their negligetnce of matters outside, and per-&#xD;
taining to) their own position, by a shower of&#xD;
arrows, wiich laid one or two of Mr. Delorme's&#xD;
negroes cold, and narrowly escaped doing the&#xD;
sane uncalled-for favor to himself and Paul.&#xD;
"There g(}es sixteen hundred dollars. The&#xD;
cursed ras'als won't leave me a nigger on the&#xD;
place !" muttered Mr. Delorme, as hue looked&#xD;
at the two wio Were downm.&#xD;
"Look out, Miss Stella! Crouch low, or&#xD;
ar arrow tay spoil your beauty," said Paul,&#xD;
coolly, as he'pushedher baek ; and then, tak-&#xD;
ing deliberate aim, knocked over the nearest&#xD;
indian to him.&#xD;
"Paul, you are very thoughtful, and a hero&#xD;
to boot. 'T'here's more in you than I thought&#xD;
there was," said Mr. Delorme. And now,&#xD;
aroused to ration, ie sent a couple of doses of&#xD;
suek-shot frotu his gun in amongst the crowd&#xD;
of Indians, Wiho were rushing up to cut down&#xD;
the gate.  severall reeled and fell, for they&#xD;
were within ctose range; arind as Paul and his&#xD;
men soot in an adiitionral volley, the Indians&#xD;
recoiled and fled beyond the reach of the guns.&#xD;
" Indian for niger, red for black, you dev-&#xD;
ils !" shouted Mr. )elorme, whose blood was&#xD;
now fairly up, fr the flames were licking up&#xD;
thousands of sli lars' worth of his property.&#xD;
The Indians inside, who saw too late that&#xD;
they had oily injured themselves by loosing&#xD;
the cattle from the pens, for the infuriated&#xD;
beasts ran wtlly to and fro aBout the tdace,&#xD;
and kept the foefrom approaching the house&#xD;
in a body, now bigan to shoot them down',and&#xD;
Mr. Delormne had to groan for his herds as well&#xD;
as his negroes.&#xD;
But suddenly the shrill note of a bugle was&#xD;
heard    tl   hea coming in close order, and at&#xD;
full speed, abalndof mounted men approached.&#xD;
Taking the Itlianus who had been repulsed&#xD;
from the ga'e in dnik, they charged with loud&#xD;
yells, delivering a rapid fire with their " six-'&#xD;
shooters," w' iI semit the red fiends flying over&#xD;
the plain. ''hen, wheeling, they headed for&#xD;
the gate, which Mr. Delorie now caused to&#xD;
be thrown open.&#xD;
t The Intlins within, hearing the firing with-&#xD;
out, and tihe well-known war-cry of the Rang-&#xD;
ers, did not wait for their murderous charge,&#xD;
but hastily retreated over the wall in the di-&#xD;
&#xD;
I x&#xD;
&#xD;
IE'S DREAM.                             15&#xD;
reetion by which they came, assisted by the&#xD;
drooping limbs of trees which had been left&#xD;
standing there, and which they had used as&#xD;
ladders.&#xD;
When the gate was opened, the cattle and&#xD;
horses, now in full stampede, rushed od, and&#xD;
had not the column of advancing Rangers&#xD;
swerved to one side, they must have been tram-&#xD;
pled down by the maddened beasts.&#xD;
As these swept on, scattering far away over&#xD;
the plain, and rushing off' where the Indians&#xD;
could easily gather them up and drive them&#xD;
away, the Rangers rode into the inelosuro now,&#xD;
full of dust and smoke.&#xD;
"The red devils have been giving you a&#xD;
regular warming! Inever knew themso bold,&#xD;
Mr. Delornme," said the leader of the Rangers,&#xD;
at he saw Mr. Deborme leaning on his gun at&#xD;
the foot of the tower by the gate.&#xD;
"You may well say so, Major Ben," replied&#xD;
the planter. "I doubt whether there would&#xD;
have been anything left me, even life, if you&#xD;
had not come as you did. But I did not ex-&#xD;
pect you so soon-how came you to be here so&#xD;
early ?"&#xD;
"I was out on a scout, and met your mues-&#xD;
senger-but excuse me ; hadn't we better go&#xD;
up to the mansion, and see what damage has&#xD;
been done there? All is still in that direction&#xD;
at present."&#xD;
"Yes, I saw the red devils getting away over&#xD;
the wall before you reached the gate."&#xD;
"The Rangers, accompanied by Mr. Delorme&#xD;
and Stella, now moved toward the mansion,&#xD;
but Paul remained to guard against a return&#xD;
of the Indians, if they should venture to rally&#xD;
and renew the attack.&#xD;
"'Who comes there?   Stand where ye are,&#xD;
all of ye, till one of ye advances wid the&#xD;
countersign," shouted General Mahoney.&#xD;
"You open the door. Can't you see we're&#xD;
friends," shouted Mr. Delorme, in reply.&#xD;
"When a soldier is in a state o' siege, ho&#xD;
must never thrust to his eyes-we never did in&#xD;
the Carlist warr," replied the redoubtable Ma-&#xD;
honey. "Stand, I tell ye, or inc army shall&#xD;
opei fire!"&#xD;
"Let them try it, and I'll hang you on the&#xD;
tallest tree in sight," cried McCullough.&#xD;
Oeh, Major dear I is it you?  Sure to yer-&#xD;
self I'll surrender the kays of, the citadel,"&#xD;
snid Mahoney, well knowing that it would not&#xD;
be safe for him to trifle with the chief of the&#xD;
Rangers.&#xD;
The doors of the mansion were now thrown&#xD;
open ; and the major, after giving some direc-&#xD;
tions to his men, preparatory to a chase of the&#xD;
invaders when -it was light enough, entered&#xD;
with the planter and his daughter.&#xD;
"Well, what damage have you suffered&#xD;
here?" asked Mr. Delorme of his overseer.&#xD;
" One nager hit on the head with in arrow,&#xD;
sir; but the skull was too thick for penetra-&#xD;
tion. Some of the rest scared from  lack t&#xD;
mulatto, at' that's all."&#xD;

&#xD;
Paul wguld be the best she could choose.&#xD;
And he also consulted Paul in his new plans&#xD;
for rebuilding, where the destruction had oo&#xD;
curred-made him several valuable presents&#xD;
and in many ways exhibited marks of esteem&#xD;
and confidence.&#xD;
And this seemed the more-remarkahl ?&#xD;
cause he never asked after, or alluded to&#xD;
Paul's father, or the single visit which he had&#xD;
made to the plantation.&#xD;
Mrs. Delorne was overjoyed at this treat-&#xD;
ment of Paul, for now the road seemed smooth&#xD;
by which she meant to accomplish her long-&#xD;
cherished design of his union with Stella, the&#xD;
heiress of Delornme. And she took an early&#xD;
opportunity, when they were alone, to urge&#xD;
him to do his part toward bringing about this&#xD;
desirable cousunnation.&#xD;
"Stels does not seem indifferent toward&#xD;
you !" she said. "Urge your suit and ehe will&#xD;
love you!"&#xD;
" But, my good aunt, I do not love her !"&#xD;
he replied.&#xD;
"  don't ask you to love her--think of the&#xD;
property ! You may yet be the richest plant-&#xD;
er in T, xas, instead of-" she hesitated.&#xD;
A dependent upon your bounty !" said he,&#xD;
bitterly. " You might as well speak a thought&#xD;
as to harbor it !"&#xD;
"Oh, Paul, you are cruel! Were you my&#xD;
own son, I could not love you more, or do&#xD;
more for you, than I have done !"&#xD;
"A favor loses half its value when the&#xD;
giver ever holds it up, like a debtor's over-due&#xD;
note, before the receiver !"&#xD;
"Ahi, Paul, I do not deserve this ! I only&#xD;
seek your interest. It were better that you&#xD;
were married and settled down."&#xD;
"Maybe so-may be not. But I have a&#xD;
question to ash, my worthy aunt. My fa&#xD;
other -"&#xD;
Oh, for heau en's sake do not speak of&#xD;
him l" cried Mrs. Delorme, turning pale.&#xD;
" Put I will. lie tas sonic secret of yours.&#xD;
What is it?"&#xD;
"Paul-you must ns rer know it ! When&#xD;
vou do, I will cease to live," said she, half&#xD;
choking with agitation.           .&#xD;
It is strange' I" muttered Paul. "It must&#xD;
he something that much concerns me, or else&#xD;
you'd not f.ar to tell me."&#xD;
"Never speak of it to me again, Paul, if&#xD;
you love or even respect me!" she said.&#xD;
I shell not, without you stint nie iii pocket-&#xD;

My Gl, are you as base as your father?'&#xD;
she groaned.&#xD;
"A little selfish--but not base, my good&#xD;
aunt. I want to take a trip down to Galves-&#xD;
ton, and need money to keep up appearances&#xD;
I have a little divinity there, wrapped in mnus-&#xD;
lii, who thinks the world and all of me."&#xD;
" li, Paul, Paul, how you torment me !"&#xD;
'Yes-like my naweake of Tarss- Pra&#xD;

he could, the distance between hin and his&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
Paul Malerson, with a pocket full of that ar-&#xD;
tical wlwich onl/ is needed to establish one's&#xD;
gentility in our mno dlRepublic, had arrived,&#xD;
resist red his name, and just been ushered into&#xD;
the lest room of th best hotel in Galveston,&#xD;
whn a    ervanit announced a " gentleman "&#xD;
who wished to see himi on particular business.&#xD;
ad a the same tinae the servant permitted&#xD;
Captain Jack alerson to enter the room.&#xD;
Alh, Paul, hiow are you ? Been expecting&#xD;
1ou for some time. lao has Ada--told her&#xD;
aou ble her soon--said I'd look out for you,&#xD;
and here I am!1" cried the captain, as he came&#xD;
in.&#xD;
" I'imi much obliged to you for your unne,&#xD;
cessary care, sir-- almost feel old enough to&#xD;
take care of myself-the more especially that&#xD;
I have never until nowh, known anything of pa-&#xD;
rental 'arc !" said Paul, sitily.&#xD;
" No fault of mine, lad no fault of mine.&#xD;
as you will learn by-and-by. But it was ne-&#xD;
eesary tit Iha should see you the moment you&#xD;
arrive el, for I have been working for you, pack.&#xD;
ing your cards all night to palay a wiing&#xD;
game-d'e lear?"&#xD;
I hear sir, but I do not understand."&#xD;
" iVo ?  Then I'll explain.  You see, I&#xD;
knew you loved little Ada, who is a trump of&#xD;
a girl, and loves you harder than a mule can&#xD;
kick, al as I had a diamond ring worth a&#xD;
cool thousand that I didn't care much foir, so&#xD;
I took it to her and told her you sent it?&#xD;
Didln't'I do it up brown  ou're all right in&#xD;
her books now!"&#xD;
Yes--just at the tinae when I want to be&#xD;
out of them. I caine dot; n here on purpose&#xD;
to break off with her !"&#xD;
 Whaw ! What does this mean ?"&#xD;
"My aunt has arranged iattars so that it&#xD;
will be to mciy interest to marry Stella Do-&#xD;
l0orie."&#xD;
What, the old planter's daughter?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
SI ['e i rich, I suppose ?"&#xD;
" Yes, sir, very-a--nd she will be his heir-&#xD;
( Gt much by him in hard cash, jewelry,&#xD;
plate, and the likes of that ?"&#xD;
Yes, sir, a great deal ; but why do you ask&#xD;
that?"&#xD;
" Oh, for no vvry particular reason, only I&#xD;
was thinking of your interest, dye see ? 1&#xD;
lou't want to see you tangle yourself in any&#xD;
cbains but goldsn ones. A man is a fool if he&#xD;

"Thank you, sir-if I n'cd then I'll call."&#xD;
AnI with this understanding, Mr. Jack Nal-&#xD;

sunk fainting into his arm.e.&#xD;

CTA PTER XV.&#xD;
Two   weeks are, when   counted oil into&#xD;
hours by the tongue of Joy, but brief, very&#xD;
&#xD;
brief breaths of Time! Yet, i tengtnened&#xD;
by the sigh of sorrow, or the -ong-drawn&#xD;
moan of pain, how measureless ati unending&#xD;
do they seem.&#xD;
For twi weeks had Lagona dwelt beneath&#xD;
the roof of Varian Delormse. And during&#xD;
this tii e, the distrustful planter had tried, by&#xD;
many, and even by harsh and cruel means, to&#xD;
test the sincerity of the young Comachie's&#xD;
professed desire to learn the arts and ways of&#xD;
the pale-frees.&#xD;
Ie had sent him to the fields with his hoe&#xD;
in his hand. And Lagona went and did what&#xD;
he had never done before-worked! He had&#xD;
mode him perform many a menial service ;&#xD;
and though the throbbing heart of the proud&#xD;
young chief almost broke from its bonds, ho&#xD;
persevered, bowed his head, and obeyed I He&#xD;
had endeavored to throw him alone into the&#xD;
coin pany of Stella, while he Ik ept a secret&#xD;
watch upon him, to see if Lagona did not, in&#xD;
deed, intend to try to carry her off.&#xD;
But though the young chief trembled when&#xD;
he heard her voice, lie would not raise his eyes&#xD;
to look upon her; though fearless of a thous-&#xD;
and foes, lie seemed afraid, even of himself,&#xD;
weiii iim her presic.&#xD;
But another peril to an unsophisticated&#xD;
heart was in that house for him. Mrs. Do-&#xD;
lorme- asI believe I have elsewhere said-was,&#xD;
for her age, a very beautiful and attractive&#xD;
woman ; and her art and knowledge of the&#xD;
worl i rendered her capable of turning every&#xD;
point to advantage. From the -hour when he&#xD;
came to the plantation, Mrs. Delorme had&#xD;
been madly infatuated with him ; so much so,&#xD;
that she could hardly avoid attractiii the ob-&#xD;
servation of other. But Lagona die not ap-&#xD;
pear to heed her attentions. She nane hiu&#xD;
many presents, but he carelessly threw them&#xD;
aside ; and when she spoke to him, only n-.&#xD;
swered in a monosyllable and turned away.&#xD;
This very indifference only sceened to fan the&#xD;
flame which burned in her heart.   But if&#xD;
Lagona was really aware of her preference, he&#xD;
iiade not the slightest recognition of the fact-&#xD;
a matter which much pleased Stella, who,&#xD;
from the moment when Mrs. Delorme had ox-&#xD;
pressed her admiration of the young chie's&#xD;
person, had noticed her conduct, ani observed&#xD;
her evident partiality towards him. And&#xD;
thouli no tell-tale, yet the honor of her&#xD;
father was too closely held in her heart, for her&#xD;
not to feel anxious that it should not be&#xD;
stained by imprudence, not to say guilt, o&#xD;
the part of her'step-mother.&#xD;
It was night, about the time stated in the&#xD;
opening of this chapter, and Largna, who had&#xD;
been kept at work all day, was seated near&#xD;
Mrs. Delornie, who was aisliint him many&#xD;
questions regarding his tribe-th. ic habits and&#xD;
manner of Iiviig. These questions, although&#xD;
by no means pleasing to the taciturn chief,&#xD;
were answered briefly and respectfully by La-&#xD;
gona. .As he poke of his mountain home,&#xD;

The fire which opened from the tower at&#xD;
first was hot, and fatal to several of the- be-&#xD;
;e'gers; but in a short timle it slackened, for&#xD;
Paul hald begun to get short of aimmunition.&#xD;
Cut down the gate with your axes, lads,"&#xD;
*houtcd the leader, not attempting to play In-&#xD;
dian any longer in Iii.1 voice, though dressed&#xD;
like one. " Make a bold push, and the day is&#xD;
ours !"&#xD;
And1 they dil so ; and in a few moments&#xD;
would have defected an entrance, had not the&#xD;
terrible war-whhoop of the real Comanche been&#xD;
heard in their rear ; and the next instant,&#xD;
pOturinr in a  murderous fire, a hand-they&#xD;
knew  not how large, or who they were-&#xD;
bounded in amongst them, led by a warrior,&#xD;
whose every blow brought a man to the&#xD;
earth.&#xD;
" Toy our horses, lads-save yourselves as&#xD;
bsy-s  n can-toey'ire too many for us !"'&#xD;
cried the loler of the attack jog band.&#xD;
An luck a was it for them that their horses&#xD;
were near, ,e s not, one of them all would ever&#xD;
have (e p'ted. As it was, iore than half&#xD;
were ile tad upon the ground. Bat the&#xD;
lea der, liIingi desperately, got the rest ofl,&#xD;
and all of his wounded. And not being pire-&#xD;

"No. Why do you ask? Who was it?*'&#xD;
she answered.&#xD;
"It was the man that you told me tvas my&#xD;
father !" said Paul, n rrowly watching every&#xD;
change of expression in her face.&#xD;
"Heavens! John Malerson a robber ?" al.&#xD;
most screamed Mrs. I)elorme.&#xD;
Yes. I suspected as much, when I saw&#xD;
him and his associates in Galveston. lie led&#xD;
the murderous gang, disguised as Indians, to-&#xD;
night. And now I know why he asked so par&#xD;
tienlarly about the wealth of Mr. Delorme."&#xD;
" You have not told Mr. Delorea of this&#xD;
yet?"&#xD;
"No; lie was busy when I came in."&#xD;
"Then, for your life, do not I The villain&#xD;
has been foiled: do not now expose him!"&#xD;
I do not believe that he is imv father."&#xD;
"lie is, Paul-) IIeaven ! he is ! I know&#xD;
it ! Would to God that I did not!"&#xD;
" What is the secret that he holds in terror&#xD;
over your head ?" "&#xD;
"Paul, in mercy do not ask me now. The&#xD;
time may come when I will tell you ; but do&#xD;
not ask it now. 1 nam very, very wretched 1"&#xD;
And she wept, as if she, indeed, was so.&#xD;
I am going to Galveston again," said Paul,&#xD;
when his aunt became more composed.&#xD;
Far what ?" she asked.&#xD;
"To warn him, that if he puts his feet on&#xD;
this plantation again, his neck is in langer--&#xD;
even if he be my father."&#xD;
"Do be cautious, Paul ! Let me advise you&#xD;
net to go near him. some of his vile gaag&#xD;
may assassiiate you."&#xD;
" 1 do not fear them. Moreover, I must go&#xD;
to Galveston, for I promised to see Ada Me-&#xD;
Alpihi onee more, before I part with her for-&#xD;
ever  That done, you may arrange matters&#xD;
with Stella and her father, for ie, as soon as&#xD;
you please. I begin to love the girl, and I an&#xD;
sure she does not dislike me."&#xD;
" Well, Paul, if you must go, do it ; but re-&#xD;
turn quickly. Take this purse: it containa&#xD;
all the miiney which I have by me now."&#xD;
He took it, and left her again to herself.&#xD;

The girl made no reply, but stood still, and&#xD;
looked at him.&#xD;
"Maybe you don't belong here ?' he said,&#xD;
inquiringly.&#xD;
"Guess I does, Massa Malereon," said the&#xD;
girl.&#xD;
"So I suppose, since you know my name,&#xD;
my flower ' tansy. But where is Miss Ada2"&#xD;
"Never a great ways off when I'm around,&#xD;
Massa Cap'n," said the girl, showing her white&#xD;
teeth.&#xD;
"But that isn't answering my question, my&#xD;
yellow diamond."&#xD;
"Well, Massa John, you answer me one&#xD;
question, den i'll tell you whar to find Missy&#xD;
Ada."&#xD;
"Well, ask your question ; I'll take a nip&#xD;
of brandy, and answer P," said Malerson, suit-&#xD;
ing his actions to the word.&#xD;
'" What d'ye think a nice yaller gal like me&#xD;
is wuth in de Orleans market ?"&#xD;
" Well, let's see. I reckon you're about&#xD;
eighteen---well made up, clean rigged, and&#xD;
tolerable good looking' for one o' your color.&#xD;
Your hair isn't kinky, and shines like a black&#xD;
horse's mane--teeth sound, and eyes as bright&#xD;
as new pewter. I reckon you'd go close on&#xD;
to fifteen hundred dollars-maybe sixteen to&#xD;
an old chap like me."&#xD;
"A pretty high price-yet not'half what I&#xD;
set upon myself," said Ala (for it was she),&#xD;
speaking now in her natural voice.&#xD;
" Well, I'm willing to be swallowed by a&#xD;
Frenchman for a fro, and spit up ag'iin," cx-&#xD;
elaimoed the captain, in surprise. " Why, Miss&#xD;
Ada, if your natural mother was here she&#xD;
wouldn't'know you!"&#xD;
" That is all I wished to know. Now, pre-&#xD;
pare your disguise as well. I shall carry&#xD;
money enough with me for all purposes."&#xD;
The keen eyes of Malerson flashed as with a&#xD;
new idea, and he said&#xD;
"All right, Miss Ada; I will be ready by&#xD;
morning. But it won't do for you to carry&#xD;
money ; that would be so out o' fashion for&#xD;
niggeikind, it might lead to the discovery that&#xD;
you was a possumsin'."&#xD;
Possibly so. I will therefore intrust my&#xD;
funds to you ; but my weapons I will keep to&#xD;
myself. And mark me, Captain Malerson-if&#xD;
I see a sign of treachery in you, you will be&#xD;
my first victim !"&#xD;
"Bless your dear soul, Miss Ada! I'd&#xD;
sooner .thiok of cutting my own throat than&#xD;
that. You can depend on me to the last--to&#xD;
the very last !"&#xD;
"Interest leads the best of men," said Ada,&#xD;
quietly. "Let it Teal you in this case ; for I&#xD;
will make it voor interest to do my bidding.&#xD;
But now I must beg you to leave inc for the&#xD;
night ; I have much to arrange before morn-&#xD;
ing. Call then, and ask my own'servant-&#xD;
whom I shall leave here until I come back-&#xD;
for ' Lena ;' and I will, under that name, be&#xD;

i've got from her, and leave this girl to her&#xD;
luck or not! She's got so much spirit that I&#xD;
like her-I wish she liked me as wll. She&#xD;

scream. But if she does that, out will go her&#xD;

is she approached the door.&#xD;
"  pn quickly for your own sake-it is i~n.&#xD;

Startled so mtuch that she thought neither&#xD;

To her terror, the supposed negro trader&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
"Don-don't be in such a deuce of a hurry,&#xD;
brs ! Who is that a kicking' me, their law-&#xD;
fully 'lected captain?" grunted Jack Mailerson,&#xD;
some hours after he had laid down to sleep.&#xD;
Aroused by somie uninercifully severe kicks,&#xD;
he now learned two facts-on e of thoin of as-&#xD;
tounding importance, so fa' as he was con-&#xD;
cerned. It was broad dad light, first; and next,&#xD;
every man of his band was secured, and tied,&#xD;
and his greatest dread, Ben McCulough, was&#xD;
stealing over hitn, with the ropes ready, to&#xD;
fix htim iin the same way, as soon as he gained&#xD;
a sitting posture.&#xD;
" Lot d! don't kick Si) hard, old fellowI&#xD;
Remember, you wear boots 1" said Malerson,&#xD;
as an expression of stupidd terror, mingled&#xD;
with pa:in , camtecout upon. his sottishi counite-&#xD;
nanilce.&#xD;
" Get up, you infernal scoundrel, and let&#xD;
me r'pe you, then!" said the major.&#xD;
You miighit have done it while I was asleep,&#xD;
without nakimg such a fuss about iti" growled&#xD;
Malersoit.  " IIere, don't tie my hanls till l've&#xD;
taken my morning hittersl" he added, raising&#xD;
his flask'to his lip s.&#xD;
" Murder !  It's all gone -I must have&#xD;
eliptied it last night !" ie groaned, dropping&#xD;
the now useless friend upon the ground , and&#xD;
siuliuttitng his amis to the rope, which was&#xD;
uased to tie them .hinihis hack.&#xD;
"Alhi! you here, Paul, my boy-you here,&#xD;
anI see your por old father treated this 'ere&#xD;
way--kicked, cuffed, and tied ip like a pig to&#xD;
e carted to market ?'' said he, recognizing his&#xD;
Son.&#xD;
"I nu  here : but in a robber anti villain&#xD;
like yourself, recognize no relationship 1" said&#xD;
thle 'm-tu mguntan, buterly.&#xD;
' low unnatural ! What a wicked boy !&#xD;
ut you'll do your poor old dad one favor&#xD;
won't you ?  See if sote of the bows haven't&#xD;
got a li tI 'l ii left, and give te a noistener,&#xD;
to drix e away the blue-devils. Now do, boy;&#xD;
and ill forgiv' the rest of your conduct!""&#xD;
Paul turned away in utter disgust from him,&#xD;
without attending to liis request.&#xD;
Wiiere    my m  daughter, you dotubi.-d yed&#xD;
villain-----where is my daugliter  " asked Mr.&#xD;
hc o"rmue.&#xD;
" Vhein I ask questions cur 'want 'erm an-&#xD;

the captain, coolyn .&#xD;

With Stella on the swift horse of Lagoni,&#xD;
the major s hand upon its rein, and her father&#xD;
and Paul riding close by her side, the gallant&#xD;
bnd now swept away swiftly, and in silence-&#xD;
uttering lo shouts, speaking no ''ors---ds-the&#xD;
hoofs of their horses scarce making a sound&#xD;
upon the grassy earth. On, on-like a black&#xD;
shadow sweeping over the face of the earth-&#xD;
they passed, leaving the rushing Rio Pecos&#xD;
and the gloomy hills of the Charrate far in&#xD;
their rear.&#xD;
The rescue had been effected. And never&#xD;
in tale of anelent chiivalry, never in record of&#xD;
helted knighthood, never in history of modern&#xD;
bravery, had the story of a more daring deed&#xD;
been found-never greater iernl met, or more&#xD;
gallantry overcome, than there and then.&#xD;
It was a long time before Lagoua could get&#xD;
his terrified warriors ready for service  and&#xD;
when, at last, he led themOirough the gorge,&#xD;
the day was dawnini. lie rode to the spot&#xD;
where the Rangers had encamnlil (1; but only&#xD;
the smouldering embers of their fires were left&#xD;
to show that they lhd been there, and had&#xD;
been gone, also, foir hours.&#xD;
With a bitter look of augerin and disppoint-&#xD;
itnt, Lagona, at the he-ad of ver' a thousand&#xD;
warriors, took their trail. 11is hoi s were&#xD;
llbet and fresh. and he felt' uo doubt utt that&#xD;
he would overtake thein.&#xD;
Therefore, urging his horse to i isutmost&#xD;
speed, he led the wav, followed by his now re-&#xD;
assured warriors-who, as they rode on, seem-&#xD;
ed to forget the trrors of the night in the&#xD;
hope of the e -alps which the trail thy follow&#xD;
ed promised to so large a body.&#xD;

In their rear, far away, could still be seen&#xD;

Lagona saw and felt this; and it rendered&#xD;
h in more miserable thin she was. He bore&#xD;
it f' r a time ; but when lie saw no change in&#xD;
her-that she looked upon him still with aver.&#xD;
sion-lis noble nature took supremacy, and he&#xD;
determined to restore her to her relatives.&#xD;
One eveniin, before the darkness had come&#xD;
on, while the still gray of twilight lay iream-&#xD;
iily on hill and lowland-on roek, and tiee,&#xD;
and water---he entered the pretty room assign-&#xD;
ed to her, and said, very low and gently :&#xD;
"The White Flower must weep no moure11&#xD;
Lagona will take her hack to those who love&#xD;
her, and he wil ldie ; for he cannot live with-&#xD;
out the White Floweri!"&#xD;
Stella looked up in wonder, but did not re-&#xD;
ply : foe she had Ibecome so hopeless, that she&#xD;
did not realize that he leant, indeed, to give&#xD;
her freedom.&#xD;
 Does the White oiuwer hear the words of&#xD;
Lagonai i  ' he asked. " le aill hike her back&#xD;
to her father s lodge, that she may smile&#xD;
again, and make glad the hearts that love&#xD;
her!&#xD;
Lagona does not nean what lie says," she&#xD;
nurmuired : ' lie mocksIC mein my n isery!"&#xD;
"Lagona never cats his words ! lie loves&#xD;
the White Flower: ilhe does not love himu&#xD;
lhre ; but in the land of spirits she' will love&#xD;
him, for he will die fir her ! To-rnorrow, she&#xD;
slhal start for the lodhe of he father. To-&#xD;
night, Lagona hegs her to cat and drink, so&#xD;
that may tie s rog for the journey.''&#xD;
Lagona said thli  iin a low, firm toile, and&#xD;
looked so noble, thoLugh so very sad, when he&#xD;
uttered it, that StIia felt sureti e was not di-&#xD;
ceiving her.' Tai's rolled down her cheeks&#xD;
again ; but now th'e were tears of joy.&#xD;
" Noble, gfool, gede'rous Lagnila 1" she cried,&#xD;
grasping his hanl, tiil kisslin it roany times&#xD;
"I. wil never-never tiriget  on!Icannot&#xD;
love you; but I will respect you always-will&#xD;
ever call you fr'in .--a great, good, honorable&#xD;
man!&#xD;
Tie laladewhie she held an kissed, trem-&#xD;
bled like an apehn leaf, nl is whole frame&#xD;
shook with ain agit1atin 1lwhich showed how&#xD;
great was the convict in his bosom-.-with what&#xD;
a struggle he conquered his desires and pas-&#xD;
sion15.&#xD;
At last lie said, in a low and husky tone&#xD;
" Let the White Flower eat and grow strong,&#xD;
so that she can ride a treat ways to-morrow."&#xD;
"Cannot I go to-night, Lagona ?"she asked.&#xD;
"it will be very' dark ; and the White&#xD;
Flower lust have food anl mst, to make her.&#xD;
strong !" replied the chief.&#xD;
" Lagona may dream, and alter his mind,"&#xD;
said Stella, sadly.&#xD;
"No sleep will come to Lagona's'eyes;&#xD;
therefore, he cannot dream. The Whiw. J.low-&#xD;
er shall turn her face toward her father's lodge,&#xD;
and commence her journey when the great orb&#xD;
of day begins his walk across the sky !"&#xD;

The platter hastened away, as Paul, with&#xD;
eyes downast, but in a state-of agitatmin fully&#xD;
as great as that of Mr. Delorme, came from&#xD;
the direction of the guard-house, and ap-&#xD;
proachied the spot where McCullough stood.&#xD;
The young man passed so close to Ada, that&#xD;
she could have reached out her hai    and&#xD;
touched him, had she so desired. He looked&#xD;
so utterly miserable, that an expression of pity&#xD;
came over her face, in spite of her openly ex-&#xD;
piessed hatred of him.&#xD;
" bhat is the matter, Master Paul--you and&#xD;
Mr. Delormie act as if you seen a ghost, or&#xD;
beenI bukin' old Death in the fice I What is&#xD;

")o not ask 'me, major-do not ask me1"&#xD;
said Paul, with a shudder ; and when he rais-&#xD;
ed- his e1s to the viewof the major, the latter&#xD;
started he looked so utterly miserable.&#xD;
S Wel, I'd like to know what is the natttr&#xD;
-I don't think a friend, such ais 1 have p'ov-&#xD;

sail Paul, anl he passed into the house.&#xD;
\Vel, this heats tall that I've heard of,&#xD;

ever held the beist of characters, yet he talks&#xD;

"Yes, major."&#xD;
CHAPTER LVIII.R&#xD;
When Mr. Delorme left the major, he pro.&#xD;
needed directly to the apartmeist where Mrs.&#xD;
Delorme lay, very ill. He looked upon lier&#xD;
pale face, so written over with the lines of&#xD;
misery, for a few moments, ttud then turning&#xD;
to the attendants, bade then leave the room,&#xD;

you in recovering your daughter-not for my-&#xD;

that I shall b so happy as to fall in the con-&#xD;

The fee-g of the planter were deeply&#xD;
touched , his sternness melted away, and tears&#xD;
came out upon his pale and rigid  heek.&#xD;
"Neither of you shall ever leas toy roof&#xD;
with toy consent," lie said, in a 'von  half sti-&#xD;
fled with eiotioti. " Ilarriet, I do not blame&#xD;
you. Paul, I love you as if you were-my own&#xD;
son. Your father, if I' must call lin such,&#xD;
will soon be dead  and with him shah the se-&#xD;
cret be forever buried. I never will allude to&#xD;
it again."&#xD;
A wild and fearful shout was heard outside&#xD;
the door at that moment, and the next instant&#xD;
Malerso n--who, a raving maniac, had burst&#xD;
away fromt his guard-rushed into the room.&#xD;
Who says old Jack Malerson is going to&#xD;
die ?" he yelled. ' Who says old Jack will&#xD;
die?  its a bloody lie!   hell never die !&#xD;
lie's too gamne to die !"&#xD;
With his head anu1 face covered with blood,&#xD;
ghastly pale where it was not stated, his eyes&#xD;
wild anisi garin ghis haii mattesd and torn, he&#xD;
was a terrible object to look upon. Bolh the&#xD;
planter and Paul stoodailiast as be staggered&#xD;
to the centre of the room; and Mrs. Delorme&#xD;
shrieked in speechless horror, and hid her&#xD;
head beneath time bed-clothes.&#xD;
That was lIat Fontleroy's scream  " he&#xD;
cried. " Hat Fontleroy !--oh, but she was a&#xD;
pretty gal when'I found her ii'Troy ! Have&#xD;
you tunrderd ' hmliar, you old devil ?"&#xD;
AnId, as he ,eaid this, he bounded toward&#xD;
Mr. lelotrme, wit, sprang aside ; and the mis-&#xD;
erald  wreich fell to the floor, just as Major&#xD;
McCullough, Ada McAlpin, and several oth-&#xD;
ers, entered the room in pursuit of him.&#xD;
' Size him, men, and take him back to the&#xD;
gnarl-house !" said the major to a couple of&#xD;
the Rangers who had entered with him.&#xD;
"I He'll not require a guard any more, sir,"&#xD;
said one of the men, who took h ld of him to&#xD;
raise him up. " lie is as dead as a log."&#xD;
It was true: inthe fury of that last struggle&#xD;
life haid left him.&#xD;
"'Take himn up gently, and bear him out.&#xD;
He was a had man, but he shall have decent&#xD;
burial," said Mr. Delorme, with a trembling&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
'he Rangers obeyed, and the remains of the&#xD;
w-etched man were taken froms the room.&#xD;
Major McCullough and Ada also went out,&#xD;
leaving only Mr. Delormse and Paul in the room,&#xD;
&#xD;
"fHarriet," sal tne pianter, in a more kind&#xD;
and gentle tone than he had used toward lies&#xD;
for weeks, " Harriet, death has freed you from&#xD;
him at last. Look up; we will yet be hap-&#xD;
y!"&#xD;
There was no reply-not even a motion of&#xD;
the snowy counterpane, which, in her terror,&#xD;
she had drawn over her head. Both Paul&#xD;
and himself seemed at the same instant to di.&#xD;
vine what caused her silence; and a low cry&#xD;
of horror broke from their lips as they raised&#xD;
the sheets from over her face.&#xD;
She was indeed free-free from all the ills&#xD;
and persecutions of this world-free from hfe&#xD;
and its miseries I&#xD;
CHAPTER LIX,&#xD;
Of course, under these terrible circuni-&#xD;
stances, the march of McCougi and his&#xD;
Rangers was delayed. The, dead were to be&#xD;
buried-the bereaved to have time to calm&#xD;
their feelings.&#xD;
The body of Malerson was put in a coffin&#xD;
and buried decently ;hut no mourner follow-&#xD;
ed it to the grave. lut it was different with&#xD;
Mrs. Delorme : her renitins were interred with&#xD;
all the show which- persons of her position&#xD;
generally receive,; and two there were who&#xD;
followed her coffin with sad and sorrowful&#xD;
hearts.&#xD;
Although Paul had never for a moment&#xD;
supposed that she was other than his aunt un-&#xD;
til the recent denouement, he had always re.&#xD;
ceived more than a mother's care from her;&#xD;
he had never had cause to miss a mother's&#xD;
love.&#xD;
The sad ceremonies of the day were over,&#xD;
and Mr. Delorme and Paul were alone in the&#xD;
deserted chamber so lately occupied by the&#xD;
wife and mother.&#xD;
"Do not griee, Pan, my sonI" said Mr.&#xD;
Delorme.' " This hereavenent only renders&#xD;
you more dear to me! In future, whether we&#xD;
recover poor Stella or not, I shsll regard you&#xD;
as a son. Do not grieve for the loss of your&#xD;
mother ; she will be happier in another world&#xD;
than she was in this, or would have been had&#xD;
she lived."&#xD;
"I know that it is weak and unmanly in se&#xD;
to grieve, sir," said Paul, in reply; " but if 1&#xD;
lived her so much whil 1 believed her to be&#xD;
only my aunt, how much more would I have&#xD;
loved her as a motherr"&#xD;
"True, my good boy; but it is useless to&#xD;
weep for the dead-tears will not recall them,&#xD;
sighs will not reach their ears!"&#xD;
The conversation was interrupted by themn-&#xD;
trance of Mijor McCullough.&#xD;
"'Well, the 'Free Rangers,' as they tErm&#xD;
themselves, are offl' sail he, as ho tame in.&#xD;

CHAPTER      1.&#xD;
The Foot Traveller and his Dog&#xD;
Fr was at the close of one of those gor -&#xD;
geous days peculiar to the autumnal In-&#xD;
dian siumer. that a young man, with a&#xD;
small travelling hag in one hand, a stout&#xD;
staff grasped in the other, and foUowed&#xD;
by a small bliek. intelligent-looking ter-&#xD;
ricr, was traversing a wildly roinntic&#xD;
foot-path on the banks of the Iludsn --&#xD;
The road along which he was walking.&#xD;
was shaded by overhanging forest trees,&#xD;
ut at intervals, he got glimpses of the&#xD;
river flowing past at the foot of the cliff.&#xD;
with a noble view of the columnar Pali-&#xD;
aadoes on the opposi'e shore. The broad&#xD;
stream flowed n:jatically onward toj&#xD;

&#xD;
southward, its bosom reflecting the gold&#xD;

melled skies, and lively with craft of ev-&#xD;

The foot traveller on reaching a more&#xD;
elevated point in his path where the trees&#xD;
were less dense and from which the view&#xD;
was more open and extensive to the far&#xD;
reaching gaze of the eyes, he turned aside&#xD;
to a proj eting spur of the eminence and&#xD;
stood leaning upon his stick contempla-&#xD;
ting, with the air of one who could feel&#xD;
and enjoy the beauties of natural scene-&#xD;
ry, the wide prospect above, below him,&#xD;
and before him. On his right, in the di-&#xD;

&#xD;
The y'urnmainiE ilend a Side- gaie,&#xD;
and followed by his little dog, whi-h trot-&#xD;
ted close at his heels, entered an avenue&#xD;
as hard and smooth as a granite terrace.&#xD;
It wound among the trees for soein di-&#xD;
tance, and fllosing it he at length came&#xD;
in full view of one of the finest mansions&#xD;
Le had ever seen. It was a very elegant&#xD;
structure of the purest Gotbie, placed in&#xD;
the midst ofa lawn which was as soft as&#xD;
a velvet carpet. The lawn sloped grad-&#xD;
ually to the Hudson of which, and its&#xD;
shores through an opening in the trees&#xD;
of the park, it commanded an extensive&#xD;
view.&#xD;
The young man paused a moment to&#xD;
survey the beauty of the place upon&#xD;
which he had so suddenly conic, and then&#xD;
with an embarrassed air and a hesitating&#xD;
step lie moved with a slower pace to-&#xD;
wards the stately front. Hie had to pass&#xD;
around an oval plat of the deepest ver-&#xD;
dure, encircling a marble fountain, which&#xD;
catching the dyes of the western heaven,&#xD;
seemed to be showering gold into the&#xD;
broad Parian basin beneath. Gold and&#xD;
silver fishes playing about in it turned&#xD;
their glittering scales to ihe light, and&#xD;
singing-birds in the branches of an aca-&#xD;
cia above it, increased the enchantment&#xD;
of the lovely scenes which met his eyes.I&#xD;
Upon walking round the oval became&#xD;
in full sight of the portico, which consist-.&#xD;
ed of a trehised gallery, half hidden by&#xD;
wreaths and festoons of the delicate&#xD;
mountain fringe. A group of persons&#xD;
was seated upon the gallery enjoying the&#xD;
twilight. His eye at a glance embraced&#xD;
the individuals composing it. One of&#xD;
them was a large stout gentleman, about&#xD;
fifty, with an air of pride and self-con-'&#xD;
sideration that was repulsive. He had&#xD;
been reading a gazette that lay upon his&#xD;
&#xD;
l;,p, but now lifted his eyes from it y&#xD;
fix them upon the stranger.&#xD;
Near him were two beautiful children&#xD;
riding together upon a rocking horse&#xD;
and making the gothic arches of the&#xD;
hall ring with their glee. Farther off. at&#xD;
the extremity of the gallery, lounged an&#xD;
elegant looking young man upon a settee,&#xD;
engaged in smoking a cigar, and playing&#xD;
with a young grey-hound.&#xD;
The young traveller approached the&#xD;
portico, and catching the eye of the el-&#xD;
derly gentleman, raised'his hat and bow-&#xD;
ing. advanced and said,&#xD;
'I believe this is the residence of Dr.&#xD;
Sheridine? '&#xD;
'Yes. Who do you wish to see?' de-&#xD;
manded Dr. Sheridine in a cold tone,&#xD;
surveying him from head to foot.&#xD;
'Dr. Sheridine. sir,' answered the&#xD;
young man respectfully.&#xD;
'Well, what have you to say?'&#xD;
'I have a letter for you, sir, if you are&#xD;
that gentleman,' answered the student,&#xD;
and taking it from his pocket he handed&#xD;
it to him.&#xD;
The Dctor glanced at the sup erserip&#xD;
tion with an umoph, and a second look at&#xD;
the bearer of a more favorable charac-&#xD;
ter, and saying,&#xD;
'Be seated, sir, while I read the letter'&#xD;
IThe student, however, merely slightly&#xD;
bowed in acknowledgment of his atten.&#xD;
tion, and remained standing.  The ele&#xD;
gant young man was all the while re-&#xD;
garding him with a look of delicate in-&#xD;
spection that carried with it a certain&#xD;
expression of haughty contempt that&#xD;
caused the object of it to color, and to&#xD;
feel for him a sudden and strong preju-&#xD;
dice or dislike; and this was not de-&#xD;
creased by seeing him endeavor to sct&#xD;

0THE FLYING CLOUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Sir,&#xD;
'In reply to your letter desiring me&#xD;
to send you some young gentleman of&#xD;
the graduating class, who is well quali-&#xD;
fied to instruct your son and daughter&#xD;
in patin, Greek, French, and other&#xD;
braulhes of a thorough education, I ean-&#xD;
not 4o better than by making such a&#xD;
person the bearer of my answer. This&#xD;
will le handed you by Charles Winder,&#xD;
asyoung gentleman of poor, but highly&#xD;
respectable parentage; his grandfather&#xD;
having once been go} ernor of this State.&#xD;
Ie ht   taken the first honors in his&#xD;
class, tnd is destined for the-law, but&#xD;
as he has not the means to enable him&#xD;
to pursue his studies without some re-&#xD;
sources, he has gladly embraced the&#xD;
proposition I have made to him, and&#xD;
consents forthwith to proceed to Laurel&#xD;
Park, and enter at once upon [is duties&#xD;
He is a young man of unblemished re-&#xD;
putation, and one whom you will find&#xD;
worthy of the contidece you place in&#xD;
him   Trusting that he will give you&#xD;
satisfaction. I remain your former friend&#xD;
and classmate,&#xD;

Professor of Ure k and Lrtin,&#xD;
in ---College.&#xD;

After Dr. Sheiline, who had been&#xD;
formerly a c lebr ated practitioner of&#xD;
miicine in New York and had now re-&#xD;
tired on a fortune. hal finished the pcru-&#xD;
sal of the letter written to him by his&#xD;
friend at the university, he slowly fold-&#xD;
ed the letter, regarding closely as he did&#xD;
so, the features of the applicant for the&#xD;
tutorship in, his family. At length, with&#xD;
a more hospitable and friendly look than&#xD;
ho had hitherto worn, he said, though&#xD;
&#xD;
still in the pompous tone characteristic&#xD;
of the man,&#xD;
' Well, Mr. Winder, I have read your&#xD;
Professor's letter. lie speaks favorably&#xD;
of you. .I am glad to see you! I like&#xD;
your promptness. Walk in and take a&#xD;
seat. Edgar, this young man is Mr.&#xD;
Winder our tutor. This is my son, Mr.&#xD;
Winder.'&#xD;
Edgar Sheridine bowed haughtily&#xD;
without rising from his lounging position,&#xD;
and then began to caress his greyhound&#xD;
as if no Mr. Charles Winder was in ex-&#xD;
isten cc.&#xD;
' When did you leave the University ?'&#xD;
asked Dr. Sheridine of the young stu-&#xD;
dent,&#xD;
'Five days since. I stopped a day at&#xD;
my mother's in a village in Vermont&#xD;
and proceeded to Albany and took a&#xD;

days on the river.'&#xD;
'You should have come in a steamer.&#xD;
You would have been here yesterday&#xD;
morning,' said Dr. Sheridine, bluntly.&#xD;
My resources are not very great, sir,'&#xD;
answered Charles, smiling, 'and it be-&#xD;
hoves me to husband my li tie funds.'&#xD;
' Economy is a great virtue. You&#xD;
hear that, Edgar. 1 wish you would&#xD;
take a lesson from Mr. Winder.'&#xD;
'Mr. Winder has not come here to be&#xD;
my tutor, nor do I think I shall conde-&#xD;
scend to be his pupil. Economy is very&#xD;
well in leer students; but in a rich&#xD;
young man like myself it is absurd.'&#xD;
'lRic, you spendthrift,' repeated the&#xD;
doctor, with a chuckle, as if quite grati-&#xD;
fied to know that he had a rich son, this&#xD;
fact implying wealth in himself: 'you&#xD;
wouldn't have a penny but for me, you&#xD;
dog.'&#xD;

by ide, a youth about fourteen years of&#xD;
age and a beautiful cherry-checked maid-&#xD;
en of sixteen. The phaeton contained&#xD;
afine-loeking old gentleman about three&#xD;
score, and a brilliant, spirited girl of&#xD;
nineteen, with dark eyes, and a head and&#xD;
figure like a Juno.&#xD;
' Ah, General, good evening.  Very&#xD;
glad to see you at Laurel Park ' cried&#xD;
Dr. Sheridine, rising and approaching&#xD;
the carriage: 'and you, Miss Rosabel.&#xD;
are welcome too. Bright eyes and beau-&#xD;
ty always find favor in my eyes, albeit I&#xD;
am on the other side of fifty?'&#xD;
'We thought we would take advan-&#xD;
tage of the fine twilight, Doctor, and&#xD;
take a drive over in company with your&#xD;
young people,' answered General Liffing-&#xD;
well.&#xD;
'The doctor, I dare say, compliments&#xD;
himself I came expressly to see him&#xD;
that he being a gay widower,'-said Miss&#xD;
Liffingwcll, smiling archly,&#xD;
'No, I don't go quite so far; Edgar&#xD;
here would be stepping across my path,&#xD;
and steal all my honors.'&#xD;
Young Sheridine had thrown away&#xD;
his segar and hastened to the phaeton&#xD;
with- a beaming smile upon his truly&#xD;
fine features, and had passed round on&#xD;
the opposite side where Miss Liflingwell&#xD;
was seated.&#xD;
' You will alight, Rosabel,' he said,&#xD;
fixing upon her his eyes with an expres-&#xD;
sion that betrayed a deep regard for her.&#xD;
'You really honored us by coming. Al-&#xD;
low me to assist you i'&#xD;
'You are very kind, Mr. Sheridine,'&#xD;
answered the young lady in a quiet in-&#xD;
different tone that contrasted strangely&#xD;
with the warmth with which he had&#xD;
made his offer of aid; 'but I can alight&#xD;
without assistance if father intends&#xD;
stopping: besides, there is your "sister&#xD;
&#xD;
Clara waiting for a cavalier to assist bet,&#xD;
from her horse!'&#xD;
'O, Clara has Frank to help her!l' re-&#xD;
plied Edgar Sheridine, slightly knitting&#xD;
his brow, and biting his lip.&#xD;
I think we shall hardly get out, it is&#xD;
so late,' answered the young lady.&#xD;
'That can't be allowed, Miss Rosa,'&#xD;
cried the Doctor,' you visit us so seldom&#xD;
that now we have you we must keep you.&#xD;
One would suppose you lived at least&#xD;
five leagues instead of five miles.'&#xD;
'It is as Rosa says,' answered the&#xD;
General.&#xD;
'Then I believe we will return, dear&#xD;
father.'&#xD;
'You would have alighted if you had&#xD;
not found me at home, Miss Lefflingwell,'&#xD;
said Edgar, with a displeased look.&#xD;
She turned away her face and seemed&#xD;
not to hear him In the direction which&#xD;
her gaze took her eye fell upon the no-&#xD;
ble figure and frank intelligent counte-&#xD;
nance of the handsome student. She let&#xD;
her gaze rest for full a minute upon his&#xD;
fair face with surprise and interest. As&#xD;
he was not looking towards her, she re-&#xD;
arded him without being observed. She&#xD;
was struck with his appearance and be-&#xD;
came inspired by a desire to learn who&#xD;
he was.&#xD;
'Pray, Mr. Sheridine, who is your&#xD;
young friend in the gallery?' she asked&#xD;
in an undertone, and addressing Edgar,&#xD;
as if he had not just spoken to her in a&#xD;
voice of angry emotion.&#xD;
'That young man is some poor stu-&#xD;
dent, I believe, whom the doctor has en&#xD;
gaged to teach Frank and Clara;' an.&#xD;
swered the young man with as much&#xD;
civility as he could command towards -&#xD;
herself, but with a tone of contempt in&#xD;
reference to Charles Winder.&#xD;
